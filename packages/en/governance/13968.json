That the said Warren Hastings, in defiance of\r\nthe judgment and lawful orders of his superiors, which in this case left\r\nhim no option, declared, that _he disapproved of publishing for\r\nproposals, and that the contract was reduced too low already_: thereby\r\navowing himself the advocate of the contractor, against whom, as\r\nrepresentative of the Company, and guardian of their interests, he\r\nproperly was party, and preferring the advantage of the contractor to\r\nthose of his own constituents and employers. That the Court of Directors\r\nof the East India Company, having carefully considered the circumstances\r\nand tendency of this transaction, condemned it in the strongest terms,\r\ndeclaring, that they would _not permit_ the contract to be continued,\r\nand that, \"if the contractor should think himself aggrieved, and take\r\nmeasures in consequence by which the Company became involved in loss or\r\ndamage, they should certainly hold the majority of the Council\r\nresponsible for such loss or damage, and proceed against them\r\naccordingly.\"--That the said Warren Hastings, in defiance of orders,\r\nwhich the Directors say were _plain and unequivocal_, did, in January,\r\n1777, receive from George Templer a proposal essentially different from\r\nthe advertisement published by the Governor-General and Council for\r\nreceiving proposals for feeding the Company's elephants, and did accept\r\nthereof, not only without having recourse to the proper means for\r\nascertaining whether the said proposal was the lowest that would be\r\noffered, but with another actually before the board nearly thirty per\r\ncent lower than that made by the said George Templer, to whom the said\r\nWarren Hastings granted a contract, in the terms proposed by the said\r\nTempler, for three years, and did afterwards extend the same to five\r\nyears, with new and distinct conditions, accepted by the said Warren\r\nHastings, without advertising for fresh proposals, by which the Company\r\nwere very considerable losers: on all which the Court of Directors\r\ndeclared, \"that this waste of their property could not be permitted;\r\nthat he, the said Warren Hastings, had disregarded their authority, and\r\ndisobeyed their orders, in not taking the lowest offers\"; and they\r\nordered that the contract for elephants should be annulled: and the said\r\nDirectors further declared, that, \"if the contractor should recover\r\ndamages of the Company for breach of engagement, they were determined,\r\nin such case, to institute a suit at law against those members of the\r\nboard who had presumed, in direct breach of their orders, to prefer the\r\ninterest of an individual to that of the Company.\"--That the said Warren\r\nHastings did, in the year 1777, conclude with ---- Forde a contract for\r\nan armed vessel for the pilotage of the Chittagong river, and for the\r\ndefence of the coast and river against the incursions of robbers, for\r\nthe term of five years, in further disobedience of the Company's orders\r\nrespecting the mode and duration of contracts, and with a considerable\r\nincrease of expense to the Company. That the farming out the defence of\r\na country to a contractor, being wholly unprecedented, and evidently\r\nabsurd, could have no real object but to enrich the contractor at the\r\nCompany's expense: since either the service was not dangerous, and then\r\nthe establishment was totally unnecessary, or, if it was a dangerous\r\nservice, it was evidently the interest of the contractor to avoid such\r\ndanger, and not to hazard the loss of his ship or men, which must be\r\nreplaced at his own expense, and therefore that an active and faithful\r\ndischarge of the contractor's duty was incompatible with his\r\ninterest.--That the said Warren Hastings, in further defiance of the\r\nCompany's orders, and in breach of the established rule of their\r\nservice, did, in the year 1777, conclude a contract with the master and\r\ndeputy master attendant of the Company's marine or pilot service, for\r\nsupplying the said marine with naval stores, and executing the said\r\nservice for the term of two years, and without advertising for\r\nproposals. That the use and expenditure of such stores and the direction\r\nof the pilot vessels are under the management and at the disposition of\r\nthe master attendant by virtue of his office; that he is officially the\r\nproper and regular check upon the person who furnishes the stores, and\r\nbound by his duty to take care that all contracts for furnishing such\r\nstores are duly and faithfully executed. That the said Warren Hastings,\r\nby uniting the supply and the check in the same hands, did not only\r\ndisobey the Company's specific orders, and violate the fundamental rules\r\nand practice of the service, but did overset the only just and rational\r\nprinciple on which this and every other service of a similar nature\r\nought to be conducted, and did not only subject the Company's interest,\r\nin point of expense, to fraud and collusion, but did thereby expose the\r\nnavigation of the Bengal river to manifest hazard and distress:\r\nconsidering that it is the duty of the master attendant to take care\r\nthat the pilot vessels are constantly stationed in the roads to wait\r\nthe arrival of the Company's ships, especially in tempestuous weather,\r\nand that they should be in a constant condition to keep the sea; whereas\r\nit is manifestly the interest of the contractor, in the first instance,\r\nto equip the said vessels as scantily as possible, and afterwards to\r\nexpose them as little as possible to any service in which the stores to\r\nbe replaced by him might be lost or consumed. And, finally, that in\r\nJune, 1779, the said contract was prolonged to the said master\r\nattendant, by the said Warren Hastings, for the further period of two\r\nyears from the expiration of the first, without advertising for\r\nproposals.--That it does not appear that any of the preceding contracts\r\nhave been annulled, or the charges attending any of them abated, or that\r\nthe Court of Directors have ever taken any measures to compel the said\r\nWarren Hastings to indemnify the Company, or to make good any part of\r\nthe loss incurred by the said contracts.\r\n\r\nThat in the year 1777 the said Warren Hastings did recommend and appoint\r\nJohn Belli, at that time his private secretary, to be agent for\r\nsupplying the garrison of Fort William with victualling stores; that the\r\nstores were to be purchased with money advanced by the Company, and that\r\nthe said agent was to be allowed a commission or percentage for his risk\r\nand trouble; that, in order to ascertain what sum would be a reasonable\r\ncompensation for the agent, the Governor-General and Council agreed to\r\nconsult some of the principal merchants of Calcutta; that the merchants\r\nso consulted reported their opinion, that twenty per cent on the prime\r\ncost of the stores would be a reasonable compensation to the agent;\r\nthat, nevertheless, the said Warren Hastings, supported by the vote and\r\nconcurrence of Richard Barwell, then a member of the Supreme Council,\r\ndid propose and carry it, that thirty per cent per annum should be\r\nallowed upon all stores to be provided by the agent. That the said\r\nWarren Hastings professed that \"he preferred an agency to a contract for\r\nthis service, because, if it were performed by contract, it must then be\r\nadvertised, and the world would know what provision was made for the\r\ndefence of the fort\": as if its being publicly known that the fort was\r\nwell provided for defence were likely to encourage an enemy to attack\r\nit. That in August, 1779, in defiance of the principle laid down by\r\nhimself for preferring an agency to a contract, the said Warren Hastings\r\ndid propose and carry it, that the agency should be _converted into a\r\ncontract_, to be granted to the said John Belli, without advertising for\r\nproposals, and fixed for the term of five years,--\"pretending that he\r\nhad received frequent remonstrances from the said agent concerning the\r\nheavy losses and inconveniences to which he was _subjected_ by the\r\nindefinite terms of his agency,\" notwithstanding it appeared by evidence\r\nproduced at the board, that, on a supply of about 37,000_l._, he had\r\nalready drawn a commission of 22,000_l._ and upwards. That the said\r\nWarren Hastings pledged himself, that, _if required by the Court of\r\nDirectors, the profits arising from the agency should be paid into the\r\nCompany's treasury, and appropriated as the Court should direct_. That\r\nthe Court of Directors, as soon as they were advised of the first\r\nappointment of the said agency, declared that they considered the\r\ncommission of twenty per cent as an ample compensation to the agent, and\r\ndid positively order, that, according to the engagement of the said\r\nWarren Hastings, \"the commission paid or to be paid to the said agent\r\nshould be reduced to twenty pounds per cent.\" That the said John Belli\r\ndid positively refuse to refund any part of the profits he had received,\r\nor to submit to a diminution of those which he was still to receive; and\r\nthat the said Warren Hastings has never made good his own voluntary and\r\nsolemn engagement to the Court of Directors hereinabove mentioned: and\r\nas his failure to perform the said engagement is a breach of faith to\r\nthe Company, so his performance of such engagement, if he had performed\r\nit, and even his offering to pledge himself for the agent, in the first\r\ninstance, ought to be taken as presumptive evidence of a connection\r\nbetween the said Warren Hastings and the said agent, his private\r\nsecretary, which ought not to exist between a Governor acting in behalf\r\nof the Company and a contractor making terms with such Governor for the\r\nexecution of a public service.\r\n\r\nThat, before the expiration of the contract hereinbefore mentioned for\r\nsupplying the army with draught and carriage bullocks, granted by the\r\nsaid Warren Hastings to Ernest Alexander Johnson for three years, the\r\nsaid Warren Hastings did propose and carry it in Council, that a new\r\ncontract should be made on a new plan, and that an offer thereof should\r\nbe made to Richard Johnson, brother and executor of the said contractor,\r\nwithout advertising for proposals, for the term of _five years_; that\r\nthis offer was _voluntarily accepted_ by the said Richard Johnson, who\r\nat the same time desired and obtained that the new contracts should be\r\nmade out in the name of Charles Croftes, the Company's accountant and\r\nsub-treasurer at Fort William; that the said Charles Croftes offered the\r\nsaid Richard Johnson as one of his securities for the performance of\r\nthe said contract, who was accepted as such by the said Warren Hastings;\r\nand that, at the request of the said contractor, the contract for\r\nvictualling the Europeans serving at the Presidency was added to and\r\nunited with that for furnishing bullocks, and fixed for the same period.\r\nThat this extension of the periods of the said contracts was not\r\ncompensated by a diminution in the charge to be incurred by the Company\r\non that account, as it ought to have been, but, on the contrary, the\r\ncharge was immoderately increased by the new contracts, insomuch that it\r\nwas proved by statements and computations produced at the board, that\r\nthe increase on the victualling contract would in five years amount to\r\n40,000_l._, and that the increase on the bullock contract in the same\r\nperiod would amount to above 400,000_l._ That, when this and many other\r\nweighty objections against the terms of the said contracts were urged in\r\nCouncil to the said Warren Hastings, he declared that _he should deliver\r\na reply thereto_; but it does not appear that he did ever deliver such\r\nreply, or ever enter into a justification of any part of his conduct in\r\nthis transaction.--That the act of Parliament of 1773, by which the\r\nfirst Governor-General and Council were appointed, did expressly limit\r\nthe duration of their office to the term of five years, which expired in\r\nOctober, 1779, and that the several contracts hereinbefore mentioned\r\nwere granted in September, 1779, and were made to continue _five_ years\r\nafter the expiration of the government by which they were granted. That\r\nby this anticipation the discretion and judgment of the succeeding\r\ngovernment respecting the subject-matter of such contracts was taken\r\naway, and any correction or improvement therein rendered impracticable.\r\nThat the said Warren Hastings might have been justified by the rules and\r\npractice or by the necessity of the public service in binding the\r\ngovernment by engagements to endure one year after the expiration of his\r\nown office; but on no principles could he be justified in extending such\r\nengagements beyond the term of one year, much less on the principles he\r\nhas avowed, namely, \"that it was only an act of common justice in him to\r\nsecure _every man connected with him_, as far as he legally could, from\r\nthe apprehension of future oppression.\" That the oppression to which\r\nsuch apprehension, if real, must allude, could only consist in and arise\r\nout of the obedience which he feared a future government might pay to\r\nthe orders of the Court of Directors, by making all contracts _annual_,\r\nand advertising for proposals publicly and indifferently from all\r\npersons whatever, by which it might happen that such beneficial\r\ncontracts would not be constantly held by men _connected with him_, the\r\nsaid Warren Hastings. That this declaration, made by the said Warren\r\nHastings, combined with all the circumstances belonging to these\r\ntransactions, leaves no room to doubt, that, in disobeying the Company's\r\norders, and betraying the trust reposed in him as guardian of the\r\nCompany's property, his object was to purchase the attachment of a\r\nnumber of individuals, and to form a party capable of supporting and\r\nprotecting him in return.\r\n\r\nThat, with the same view, and on the same principles, it appears that\r\nexcessive salaries and emoluments, at the East India Company's charge\r\nand expense, have been lavished by the said Warren Hastings to sundry\r\nindividuals, contrary to the general principles of his duty, and in\r\ndirect contradiction to the positive orders of the Court of Directors:\r\nparticularly, that, whereas by a resolution of the Court of Proprietors\r\nof the East India Company, and by an instruction of the Court of\r\nDirectors, it was provided and expressly ordered that there should be\r\npaid to the late Sir John Clavering \"the sum of six thousand pounds\r\nsterling per annum in full for his services as commander-in-chief, in\r\nlieu of travelling charges and of all other advantages and emoluments\r\nwhatever,\" and whereas the Court of Directors positively ordered that\r\nthe late \"Sir Eyre Coote should receive the _same_ pay as\r\ncommander-in-chief of their forces in India as was received by\r\nLieutenant-General Sir John Clavering,\" the said Warren Hastings,\r\nnevertheless, within a very short time after Sir Eyre Coote's arrival in\r\nBengal, did propose and carry it in Council, that a new establishment\r\nshould be created for Sir Eyre Coote, by which an increase of expense\r\nwould be incurred by the India Company to the amount of eighteen\r\nthousand pounds a year and upwards, exclusive of and in addition to his\r\nsalary of ten thousand pounds a year, provided for him by act of\r\nParliament as a member of the Supreme Council, and exclusive of and in\r\naddition to his salary of six thousand pounds a year as\r\ncommander-in-chief, appointed for him by the Company, and expressly\r\nfixed to that amount.\r\n\r\nThat the disobedience and breach of trust of which the said Warren\r\nHastings was guilty in this transaction is highly aggravated by the\r\nfollowing circumstances connected with it. That from the death of Sir\r\nJohn Clavering to the arrival of Sir Eyre Coote in Bengal the\r\nprovisional command of the army had devolved to and been vested in\r\nBrigadier-General Giles Stibbert, the eldest officer on that\r\nestablishment. That in this capacity, and, as the said Warren Hastings\r\nhas declared, \"standing no way distinguished from the other officers in\r\nthe army, but by his accidental succession to the first place on the\r\nlist,\" he, the said Giles Stibbert, had, by the recommendation and\r\nprocurement of the said Warren Hastings, received and enjoyed a salary,\r\nand other allowances, to the amount of 13,854_l._ 12_s._ per annum. That\r\nSir Eyre Coote, soon after his arrival, represented to the board that a\r\nconsiderable part of those allowances, amounting to 8,220_l._ 10_s._ per\r\nannum, ought to devolve to himself, as commander-in-chief of the\r\nCompany's forces in India, and, stating that the said Giles Stibbert\r\ncould no longer be considered as commander-in-chief under the Presidency\r\nof Fort William, made a formal demand of the same. That the said Warren\r\nHastings, instead of reducing the allowances of the said Giles Stibbert\r\nto the establishment at which they stood during General Clavering's\r\ncommand, and for the continuance of which after Sir Eyre Coote's arrival\r\nthere could be no pretence, continued the allowances of 13,854_l._\r\n12_s._ per annum to the said Giles Stibbert, and at the same time, in\r\norder to appease and satisfy the demand of the said Sir Eyre Coote, did\r\ncreate for him that new establishment, hereinbefore specified, of\r\neighteen thousand pounds per annum,--insomuch that, instead of the\r\nallowance of _six thousand pounds a year, in lieu of travelling charges,\r\nand of all emoluments and allowances whatsoever_, to which the pay and\r\nallowances of commander-in-chief were expressly limited by the united\r\nact of the legislative and executive powers of the Company, the annual\r\ncharge to be borne by the Company on that account was increased by the\r\nsaid Warren Hastings to the enormous sum of thirty-eight thousand two\r\nhundred and seventeen pounds ten shillings sterling.\r\n\r\nThat on the 1st of November, 1779, the said Warren Hastings did move and\r\ncarry it in Council, \"that the Resident at the Vizier's court should be\r\nfurnished with an account of all the extra allowances and charges of the\r\ncommander-in-chief when in the field, with orders to add the same to the\r\ndebit of the Vizier's account, as a part of his general subsidy,--the\r\ncharge to commence from the day on which the general shall pass the\r\nCaramnassa, and to continue till his return to the same line.\" That this\r\nadditional expense imposed by the said Warren Hastings on the Vizier was\r\nunjust in itself, and a breach of treaty with that prince: the specific\r\namount of the subsidy to be paid by him having been fixed by a treaty,\r\nto which no addition could justly be made, but at the previous\r\nrequisition of the Vizier. That the Court of Directors, in their letter\r\nof the 18th of October, 1780, did condemn and prohibit the continuation\r\nof the allowances above mentioned to Sir Eyre Coote in the following\r\nwords: \"These allowances appear to us in a light so very extraordinary,\r\nand so repugnant to the spirit of a resolution of the General Court of\r\nProprietors respecting the allowance made to General Clavering, that we\r\npositively direct that they be discontinued immediately, and no part\r\nthereof paid after the receipt of this letter.\" That on the 27th of\r\nApril, 1781, the Governor-General and Council, in obedience to the\r\norders of the Directors, did signify the same to the Commissary-General,\r\nas an instruction to him that the extraordinary allowances to Sir Eyre\r\nCoote _should be discontinued, and no part thereof paid after that\r\nday_. That it appears, nevertheless, that the said extra allowances\r\n(amounting to above twenty thousand pounds sterling a year) were\r\ncontinued to be charged to the Vizier, and paid to Sir Eyre Coote, in\r\ndefiance of the orders of the Court of Directors, in defiance of the\r\nconsequent resolution of the Governor-General and Council, and in\r\ncontradiction to the terms of the original motion made by the said\r\nWarren Hastings for adding those allowances to the debit of the Vizier,\r\nviz., \"that they should continue till Sir Eyre Coote's return to the\r\nCaramnassa.\" That Sir Eyre Coote arrived at Calcutta about the end of\r\nAugust, 1780, and must have crossed the Caramnassa, in his return from\r\nOude, some weeks before, when the charge on the Vizier, if at any time\r\nproper, ought to have ceased. That it appears that the said allowances\r\nwere continued to be charged against the Vizier and paid to Sir Eyre\r\nCoote for three years after, even while he was serving in the Carnatic,\r\nand that this was done by the sole authority and private command of the\r\nsaid Warren Hastings.\r\n\r\nThat the East India Company having thought proper to create the office\r\nof Advocate-General in Bengal, and to appoint Sir John Day to that\r\noffice, it was resolved by a General Court of Proprietors that a salary\r\nof three thousand pounds a year should be allowed to the said Sir John\r\nDay, _in full consideration of all demands and allowances whatsoever for\r\nhis services to the Company at the Presidency of Fort William_. That the\r\nsaid Warren Hastings, nevertheless, shortly after Sir John Day's arrival\r\nin Bengal, did increase the said Sir John Day's salary and allowances to\r\nsix thousand pounds a year, in direct disobedience of the resolution of\r\nthe Court of Proprietors, and of the order of the Court of Directors.\r\nThat the Directors, as soon as they were informed of this proceeding,\r\ndeclared, \"that they held _themselves_ bound by the resolution of the\r\nGeneral Court, and that they could not allow it to be disregarded by the\r\nCompany's servants in India,\" and ordered that the increased allowances\r\nshould be forthwith discontinued. That the said Warren Hastings, after\r\nhaving first thought it necessary, in obedience to the orders of the\r\nCourt of Directors, to stop the extraordinary allowance which he had\r\ngranted to Sir John Day, did afterwards resolve that the allowance which\r\nhad been struck off should be _repaid_ to him, upon his signing an\r\nobligation to refund the amount which he might receive, in case the\r\nDirectors should confirm their former orders, already twice given. That\r\nin this transaction the said Warren Hastings trifled with the authority\r\nof the Company, eluded the repeated orders of the Directors, and exposed\r\nthe Company to the risk and uncertainty of recovering, at a distant\r\nperiod, and perhaps by a process of law, a sum of money which they had\r\npositively ordered him not to pay.\r\n\r\nThat in the latter part of the year 1776, by the death of Colonel\r\nMonson, the whole power of the government of Fort William devolved to\r\nthe Governor and one member of the Council; and that from that time the\r\nGovernor-General and Council have generally consisted of an even number\r\nof persons, in consequence of which the casting voice of the said Warren\r\nHastings has usually prevailed in the decision of all questions. That\r\nabout the end of the year 1776 the whole civil establishment of the said\r\ngovernment did not exceed 205,399_l._ per annum; that in the year 1783\r\nthe said civil establishment had been increased to the enormous annual\r\nsum of 927,945_l._ That such increase in the civil establishment could\r\nnot have taken place, if the said Warren Hastings, who was at the head\r\nof the government, with the power annexed to the casting voice, had not\r\nactively promoted the said increase, which he had power to prevent, and\r\nwhich it was his duty to have prevented. That by such immoderate waste\r\nof the property of his employers, and by such scandalous breach of his\r\nfidelity to them, it was the intention of the said Warren Hastings to\r\ngain and secure the attachment and support of a multitude of\r\nindividuals, by whose united interest, influence, and intrigues he hoped\r\nto be protected against any future inquiry into his conduct. That it was\r\nof itself highly criminal in the said Warren Hastings to have so wasted\r\nthe property of the East India Company, and that the purpose to be\r\nobtained by such waste was a great aggravation of that crime.\r\n\r\nThat among the various instances of profusion by which the civil\r\nestablishment of Fort William was increased to the enormous annual sum\r\nhereinbefore mentioned, it appears that a Salt Office was created, of\r\nsix commissioners, whose annual emoluments were as follows, viz.:--\r\n\r\nPresident, or Comptroller, per annum    £18,480\r\n1st member                               13,100\r\n2d    do                                 11,480\r\n3d    do                                 13,183\r\n4th   do                                  6,257\r\n5th   do                                 10,307\r\n                                         ------\r\n                                        £72,807\r\n\r\nThat a Board of Revenue was created by the said Warren Hastings,\r\nconsisting of five commissioners, whose annual emoluments were as\r\nfollows, viz.:--\r\n\r\n1st member, per annum                   £10,950\r\n2d    do                                  9,100\r\n3d    do                                  9,100\r\n4th   do                                  9,100\r\n5th   do                                  9,100\r\n                                         ------\r\n                                        £47,350\r\n\r\nThat David Anderson, Esquire, first member of the said board, did not\r\nexecute the duties, though he received the emoluments of the said\r\noffice: having acted, for the greatest part of the time, as ambassador\r\nto Mahdajee Sindia, with a further salary of 4,280_l._ a year, making in\r\nall 15,230_l._ a year. That the said Warren Hastings did create an\r\noffice of Agent-Victualler to the garrison of Fort William, whose\r\nprofits, on an average of three years, were 15,970_l._ per annum. That\r\nthis agency was held by the Postmaster-General, who in that capacity\r\nreceived 2,200_l._ a year from the Company, and who was actually no\r\nhigher than a writer in the service. That the person who held these\r\nlucrative offices, viz., John Belli, was private secretary to the said\r\nWarren Hastings.\r\n\r\nThat the said Warren Hastings created a nominal office of Resident at\r\nGoa, where the Company never had a Resident, nor business of any kind to\r\ntransact, and gave the said nominal office to a person who was not a\r\ncovenanted servant of the Company, with an allowance of 4,280_l._ a\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThat these instances are proofs of a criminal profusion and high breach\r\nof trust to the India Company in the said Warren Hastings, under whose\r\ngovernment, and by means of whose special power, derived from the effect\r\nof his casting voice, all the said waste and profusion did take place.\r\n\r\nThat at the end of the year 1780, when, as the Court of Directors\r\naffirm, _the Company were in the utmost distress for money, and almost\r\nevery department in arrear_, and when it appears that there was a great\r\nscarcity and urgent want of grain at Fort St. George, the said Warren\r\nHastings did accept of a proposal made to him by James Peter Auriol,\r\nthen Secretary to the Council, to supply the Presidency of Fort St.\r\nGeorge with rice and other articles, and did appoint the said Auriol to\r\nbe the agent for supplying _all the other_ Presidencies with those\r\narticles; that the said Warren Hastings declared that the intention of\r\nthe appointment \"was most likely to be fulfilled by a liberal\r\nconsideration of it,\" and therefore allowed the said Auriol a commission\r\nof fifteen per cent on the whole of his disbursements, thereby rendering\r\nit the direct interest of the said Auriol to make his disbursements as\r\ngreat as possible; that the chance of capture by the enemy, or danger of\r\nthe sea, was to be at the risk of the India Company, and not of the said\r\nAuriol; that the said Warren Hastings declared personally to the said\r\nAuriol, \"that this post was intended as a reward for his long and\r\nfaithful services.\" That the President and Council of Bombay did\r\nremonstrate against what they called _the enormous amount of the\r\ncharges_ of the rice with which they wore supplied, which they state to\r\nbe nine rupees a bag at Calcutta, when they themselves could have\r\ncontracted for its delivery at Bombay, free of all risk and charges, at\r\nfive rupees and three sixteenths per bag; and that even at Madras, where\r\nthe distress and demand was greatest, the supplies of grain by private\r\ntraders, charged to the Company, were nineteen per cent cheaper than\r\nthat supplied by the said Auriol, exclusive of the risk of the sea and\r\nof capture by the enemy. That it is stated by the Court of Directors,\r\nthat the agent's commission on a supply of _a single year_ (the said\r\ncommission being not only charged on the prime cost of the rice, but\r\nalso on the freight and all other charges) would amount to pounds\r\nsterling 26,873, and by the said Auriol himself is admitted to amount to\r\n18,292_l._ That William Larkins, the Accountant-General at Port William,\r\nhaving been ordered to examine the accounts of the said agent, did\r\nreport to the Governor-General and Council, that he found them to be\r\n_correct in the additions and calculations_; and that then the said\r\nLarkins adds the following declaration: \"The agent _being upon honor_\r\nwith respect to the sums charged in his accounts for the cost of the\r\narticles supplied, I did not think myself authorized to require _any\r\nvoucher_ of the sums charged for the demurrage of sloops, either as to\r\nthe time of detention or the rate of the charge, or of those for the\r\narticles lost in going down the river; and on that ground I thought\r\nmyself equally bound to admit the sums acknowledged as received for the\r\nsales of goods returned, without requiring vouchers of the rates at\r\nwhich they were sold.\" That in this transaction the said Warren Hastings\r\nhas been guilty of a high breach of trust and duty, in the unnecessary\r\nexpenditure of the Company's money, and in subjecting the Company to a\r\nprofusion of expense, at all times wholly unjustifiable, but\r\nparticularly at the time when that expense was incurred. That the said\r\nWarren Hastings was guilty of breach of orders, as well as breach of\r\ntrust, in not advertising generally for proposals; in not _contracting_\r\nindifferently for the supplies with such merchants as might offer to\r\nfurnish them on the lowest terms; in giving an enormous commission to an\r\nagent, and that commission not confined to the prime cost of the\r\narticles, but to be computed on the whole of his charges; in accepting\r\nof the _honor_ of the said agent as a sufficient voucher for the cost of\r\nthe articles supplied, and for all charges whatever on which his\r\ncommission was to be computed; and finally, in giving a lucrative agency\r\nfor the supply of a distressed and starving province as a reward to a\r\nSecretary of State, whose labors in that capacity ought to have been\r\nrewarded by an avowed public salary, and not otherwise. That, after the\r\nfirst year of the said agency was expired, the said Warren Hastings did\r\nagree, that, for the future, the commission to be drawn by the said\r\nagent should be reduced to five per cent, which the Governor-General and\r\nCouncil then declared to be _the customary, amount drawn by merchants_;\r\nbut that even in this reduction of the commission the said Warren\r\nHastings was guilty of a deception, and did not in fact reduce the\r\ncommission from fifteen to five per cent, having immediately after\r\nresolved that he, the agent, should be allowed the current interest of\r\nCalcutta upon all his drafts on the Treasury from the day of their\r\ndates, until they should be completely liquidated; that the legal\r\ninterest of money in Bengal is twelve per cent per annum, and the\r\ncurrent interest from eight to ten per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.--PRESENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat, before the appointment of the Governor-General and Council of Fort\r\nWilliam by act of Parliament, the allowances made by the East India\r\nCompany to the Presidents of that government were abundantly sufficient;\r\nand that the said Presidents in general, and the said Warren Hastings\r\nparticularly, was restrained by a specific covenant and indenture, which\r\nhe entered into with the Company, from accepting any gifts, rewards, or\r\ngratuities whatsoever, on any account or pretence whatsoever. That in\r\nthe Regulating Act passed in the year 1773, which appointed the said\r\nWarren Hastings, Esquire, Governor-General of Fort William in Bengal, a\r\nsalary of twenty-five thousand pounds a year was established for him, to\r\nwhich the Court of Directors added, \"that he should enjoy their\r\nprincipal houses, with the plate and furniture, both in town and\r\ncountry, _rent-free_.\" That the same law which created the office and\r\nprovided the salary of the said Warren Hastings did expressly, and in\r\nthe clearest and most comprehensive terms that could be devised,\r\nprohibit him from receiving any present, gift, or donation, in any\r\nmanner or on any account whatsoever; and that the said Warren Hastings\r\nperfectly understood the meaning, and acknowledged the binding force of\r\nthis prohibition, before he accepted of the office to which it was\r\nannexed: he knew, and had declared, that _the prohibition was positive\r\nand decisive; that it admitted neither of refinement or misconstruction;\r\nand that in his opinion an opposition would be to incur the penalty_.\r\n\r\nThat, notwithstanding the covenants and engagements above mentioned, it\r\nappears in the recorded proceedings of the Governor-General and Council\r\nof Fort William, that sundry charges have been brought against the said\r\nWarren Hastings for gifts or presents corruptly taken by him before the\r\npromulgation of the act of 1773 in India, and that these charges were\r\nproduced at the Council Board in the presence of the said Warren\r\nHastings. That, in March, 1775, the late Rajah Nundcomar, a native\r\nHindoo, of the highest caste in his religion, and of the highest rank in\r\nsociety, by the offices which he had held under the country government,\r\ndid lay before the Council an account of various sums of money paid by\r\nhim to the said Warren Hastings, amounting to forty thousand pounds and\r\nupwards, for offices and employments corruptly disposed of by the said\r\nWarren Hastings, and did offer and engage to prove and establish the\r\nsame by sufficient evidence. That this account is stated with a minute\r\nparticularity and precision; the date of each payment, down to that of\r\nsmall sums, is specified; the various coins in which such payments were\r\nseverally made are distinguished; and the different persons through\r\nwhose hands the money passed into those of the said Warren Hastings are\r\nnamed. That such particularity on the face of such a charge, supposing\r\nit false, is favorable to the party wrongfully accused, and exposes the\r\naccuser to an instant and easy detection: for, though, as the said\r\nWarren Hastings himself has observed on another occasion, \"papers may be\r\nforged, and evidences may appear in numbers to attest them, yet it must\r\nalways be an _easy_ matter to detect the falsity of any forged paper\r\nproduced by examining the witnesses separately, and subjecting them to a\r\nsubsequent cross-examination, in which case, if false, they will not be\r\nable to persevere in one regular, consistent story \"; whereas, if no\r\nadvantage be taken of such particularity in the charge to detect the\r\nfalsehood thereof, and if no attempt to disprove it, and no defence\r\nwhatever be made, a presumption justly and reasonably arises in favor of\r\nthe truth of such charge. That the said Warren Hastings, instead of\r\noffering anything in his defence, declared that _he would not suffer\r\nNundcomar to appear before the board at his accuser_; that he attempted\r\nto indict his said accuser for a conspiracy, in which he failed; and\r\nthat the said Rajah Nundcomar was soon after, and while his charge\r\nagainst the said Warren Hastings was depending before the Council,\r\nindicted upon an English penal statute, which does not extend even to\r\nScotland,[1] before the Supreme Court of Judicature, for an offence said\r\nto have been committed several years before, and not capital by the laws\r\nof India, and was condemned and executed. That the evidence of this man,\r\nnot having been encountered at the time when it might and ought to have\r\nbeen by the said Warren Hastings, remains justly in force against him,\r\nand is not abated by the capital punishment of the said Nundcomar, but\r\nrather confirmed by the time and circumstances in which the accuser of\r\nthe said Warren Hastings suffered death. That one of the offices for\r\nwhich a part of the money above mentioned is stated to have been paid to\r\nthe said Warren Hastings was given by him to Munny Begum, the widow of\r\nthe late Mir Jaffier, Nabob of Bengal, whose son, by another woman,\r\nholds that title at present. That the said Warren Hastings had been\r\ninstructed by the Court of Directors of the East India Company to\r\nappoint \"_a minister_ to transact the political affairs of the\r\ngovernment, and to select for that purpose some person well qualified\r\nfor the affairs of government, to be the minister and guardian of the\r\nNabob's minority.\" That for these offices, and for the execution of the\r\nseveral duties belonging to them, the said Warren Hastings selected and\r\nappointed the said Munny Begum, a woman evidently unqualified for and\r\nincapable of such offices, and restrained from acting in such capacities\r\nby her necessary seclusion from the world and retirement in a seraglio.\r\nThat, a considerable deficiency or embezzlement appearing in this\r\nwoman's account of the young Nabob's stipend, she voluntarily declared,\r\nby a writing under her seal, that she had given fifteen thousand pounds\r\nto the said Warren Hastings for an entertainment,--which declaration\r\ncorresponds with and confirms that part of the charge produced by Rajah\r\nNundcomar to which it relates. That neither this nor any other part of\r\nthe said charge has been at any time directly denied or disputed by the\r\nsaid Warren Hastings, though made to his face, and though he was\r\nrepeatedly accused by his colleagues, who were appointed by Parliament\r\nat the same time with himself, of peculation of every sort. That,\r\ninstead of promoting a strict inquiry into his conduct for the clearance\r\nof his innocence and honor, he did repeatedly endeavor to elude and\r\nstifle all inquiry by attempting to dissolve the meetings of the Council\r\nat which such charges were produced, and by other means, and has not\r\nsince taken any steps to disprove or refute the same. That the said\r\nWarren Hastings, so long ago as September, 1775, assured the Court of\r\nDirectors, \"that it was his fixed determination most fully and\r\nliberally to explain every circumstance of his conduct on the points on\r\nwhich he had been injuriously arraigned, and to afford them the clearest\r\nconviction of his own integrity, and of the propriety of his motives for\r\ndeclining a present defence of it\"; and having never since given to the\r\nCourt of Directors any explanation whatever, much less the full and\r\nliberal explanation he had promised so repeatedly, has thereby abandoned\r\neven that late and protracted defence which he himself must have thought\r\nnecessary to be made at some time or other, and which he would be\r\nthought to have deferred to a period more suitable and convenient than\r\nthat in which the facts were recent, and the impression of these and\r\nother charges of the same nature against him was fresh and unimpaired in\r\nthe minds of men.\r\n\r\nThat on the 30th of March, 1775, a member of the Council produced and\r\nlaid before the board a petition from Mir Zein Abul Deen, (formerly\r\nfarmer of a district, and who had been in creditable stations,) setting\r\nforth, that Khân Jehan Khân, then Phousdar of Hoogly, had obtained that\r\noffice from the said Warren Hastings, with a salary of seventy-two\r\nthousand sicca rupees a year, and that the said _Phousdar had given a\r\nreceipt of bribe to the patron of the city_, meaning Warren Hastings, to\r\npay him annually thirty-six thousand rupees a year, and also to his\r\nbanian, Cantoo Baboo, four thousand rupees a year, out of the salary\r\nabove mentioned. That by the thirty-fifth article of the instructions\r\ngiven to the Governor-General and Council, they are directed\r\n\"immediately to cause the strictest inquiry to be made into all\r\noppressions which might have been committed either against the natives\r\nor Europeans, and into all abuses that might have prevailed in the\r\ncollection of the revenues, or any part of the civil government of the\r\nPresidency, and to communicate to the Directors all information which\r\nthey might be able to obtain relative thereto, or to any dissipation or\r\nembezzlement of the Company's money.\" That the above petition and\r\ninstruction having been read in Council, it was moved that the\r\npetitioner should be ordered to attend the next day to make good his\r\ncharge. That the said Warren Hastings declared, \"that it appeared to him\r\nto be the purpose of the majority to make him the sole object of their\r\npersonal attacks; that they had taken their line, and might pursue it;\r\nthat he should have other remarks to make upon this transaction, but, as\r\nthey would be equally applicable _to many others_ which in the course of\r\nthis business were likely to be brought before the board, he should say\r\nno more on the subject\";--and he objected to the motion. That by the\r\npreceding declaration the said Warren Hastings did admit that many other\r\ncharges were likely to be brought against him, and that such charges\r\nwould be of a similar nature to the first, viz., a corrupt bargaining\r\nfor the disposal of a great office, since he declared that his remarks\r\non that transaction would be equally applicable to the rest; and that,\r\nby objecting to the motion for the personal attendance of the accuser,\r\nhe resisted and disobeyed the Company's instructions, and did, as far as\r\ndepended on his power, endeavor to obstruct and prevent all inquiry into\r\nthe charge. That in so doing he failed in his duty to the Company, he\r\ndisobeyed their express orders, and did leave the charge against himself\r\nwithout a reply, and even without a denial, and with that unavoidable\r\npresumption against his innocence which lies against every person\r\naccused who not only refuses to plead, but, as far as his vote goes,\r\nendeavors to prevent an examination of the charge, and to stifle all\r\ninquiry into the truth of it. That, the motion having been nevertheless\r\ncarried, the said Warren Hastings did, on the day following, declare,\r\n\"that he could not sit to be confronted with such accusers, nor suffer a\r\njudicial inquiry into his conduct at the board of which he was\r\npresident, and declared the meeting of the board dissolved.\" That the\r\nboard continued to sit and examine witnesses, servants of the Phousdar,\r\non oath and written evidence, being letters under the hand and seal of\r\nthe Phousdar, all directly tending to prove the charge: viz., that, out\r\nof the salary of seventy-two thousand rupees a year paid by the Company,\r\nthe said Phousdar received but thirty-two thousand, and that the\r\nremainder was received by the said Warren Hastings and his banian. That\r\nthe Phousdar, though repeatedly ordered to attend the board, did, under\r\nvarious pretences, decline attending, until the 19th of May, when, the\r\nletters stated be his, that is, under his hand and seal, being shown to\r\nhim, it was proposed by a member of the board that he should be asked\r\nwhether he had any objection to swear to the truth of such answers as he\r\nmight make to the questions proposed by the board; that the said Warren\r\nHastings objected to his being put to his oath; that the question was\r\nnevertheless put to him, in consequence of a resolution of the board;\r\nthat he first declined to swear, under pretence _that it was a matter of\r\nserious consequence to his character to take an oath_, and, when it was\r\nfinally left to his option, he declared, \"Mean people might swear, but\r\nthat his character would not allow him,--that he could not swear, and\r\nhad rather subject himself to a loss.\" That the evidence in support of\r\nthe charge, being on oath, was in this manner left uncontradicted. That\r\nit was admitted by the said Warren Hastings, that neither Mussulmen or\r\nHindoos are forbidden by the precepts of their religion to swear; that\r\nit is not true, as the said Warren Hastings asserted, that it was\r\nrepugnant to the _manners_ either of Hindoos or Mussulmen; and that, if,\r\nunder such pretences, the natives were to be exempted from taking an\r\noath, when examined by the Governor and Council, all the inquiries\r\npointed out to them by the Company's instructions might stop or be\r\ndefeated. That no valid reason was or could be assigned why the said\r\nPhousdar should not be examined on oath; that the charge was not against\r\nhimself; and that, if any questions had been put to him, tending to make\r\nhim accuse himself, he might have declined to answer them. That, if he\r\ncould have safely sworn to the innocence of the said Warren Hastings,\r\nfrom whom he received his employment, he was bound in gratitude as well\r\nas justice to the said Warren Hastings to have consented to be examined\r\non oath; that, not having done so, and having been supported and abetted\r\nin his refusal by the said Warren Hastings himself, whose character and\r\nhonor, were immediately at stake, the whole of the evidence for the\r\ntruth of the charge remains unanswered, and in full force against the\r\nsaid Warren Hastings, who on this occasion recurred to the declaration\r\nhe had before made to the Directors, viz., \"that he would most fully and\r\nliberally explain every circumstance of his conduct,\" but has never\r\nsince that time given the Directors any explanation whatsoever of his\r\nsaid conduct. And finally, that, when the Court of Directors, in\r\nJanuary, 1776, referred the question (concerning the legality of the\r\npower assumed and repeatedly exercised by the said Warren Hastings, of\r\ndissolving the Council at his pleasure) to the late Charles Sayer, then\r\nstanding counsel of the East India Company, the said Charles Sayer\r\ndeclared his opinion in favor of the power, but concerning the use and\r\nexercise of it in the cases stated did declare his opinion in the\r\nfollowing words: \"I believe he, Warren Hastings, is the first governor\r\nthat ever dissolved a council inquiring into his behavior, when he was\r\ninnocent.\" Before he could summon three councils, and dissolve them, he\r\nhad time fully to consider what would be the result of such conduct, _to\r\nconvince everybody beyond a doubt of his conscious guilt_.--That, by a\r\nresolution of a majority of the Council, constituting a lawful act of\r\nthe Governor-General and Council, the said Khân Jehan Khân was dismissed\r\nfrom the office of Phousdar of Hoogly for a contempt of the authority of\r\nthe board; that, within a few weeks after the death of the late Colonel\r\nMonson, the number of the Council being then even, and all questions\r\nbeing then determined by the Governor-General's casting voice, the said\r\nWarren Hastings did move and carry it in Council, that the said Khân\r\nJehan Khân should be restored to his office; and that restoration, not\r\nhaving been preceded, accompanied, or followed by any explanation or\r\ndefence whatsoever, or even by a denial of the specific and\r\ncircumstantial charge of collusion with the said Khân Jehan Khân, has\r\nconfirmed the truth of the said charge.\r\n\r\nThat, besides the sums charged to have been paid to the said Warren\r\nHastings by the said Nundcomar and Munny Begum and Khân Jehan Khân, and\r\nbesides the sum of one hundred and ten thousand pounds already mentioned\r\nto have been accepted without hesitation by him, as a present on the\r\npart of the Nabob of Oude and that of his ministers, the circumstances\r\nof which have been particularly reported to the House of Commons, it\r\nappears by the confession of the said Warren Hastings, that he has at\r\ndifferent times since the promulgation of the act of 1773, received\r\nvarious other sums, contrary to the express prohibition of the said act,\r\nand his own declared sense of the evident intent and obligation\r\nthereof.--That in the month of June, 1780, the said Warren Hastings made\r\nto the Council what he called \"a very unusual tender, by offering to\r\nexonerate the Company from the expense of a particular measure, and to\r\n_take it upon himself_; declaring that he had already deposited two lacs\r\nof rupees [or twenty-three thousand pounds] in the hands of the\r\nCompany's sub-treasurer for that service.\" That in a subsequent letter,\r\ndated the 29th of November, 1780, he informed the Court of Directors,\r\nthat \"this money, by whatever means it came into their possession, _was\r\nnot his own_\"; but he did not then, nor has he at any time since, made\r\nknown to the Court of Directors from whom or on what account he received\r\nthat money, as it was his duty to have done in the first instance, and\r\nnotwithstanding the said Directors signified to him their expectation\r\nthat he should communicate to them \"immediate information of the channel\r\nby which this money came into his possession, with a complete\r\nillustration of the cause or causes of so extraordinary an event.\" But,\r\nfrom evidence examined in England, it has been discovered that this\r\nmoney was received by the said Warren Hastings from Cheyt Sing, the\r\nRajah of Benares, who was soon after dispossessed of all his property\r\nand driven from his country and government by the said Warren Hastings.\r\nThat, notwithstanding the declaration made by the said Warren Hastings,\r\nthat he had actually deposited the sum above mentioned in the hands of\r\nthe Company's sub-treasurer for their service, it does not appear that\r\n\"any entry whatsoever of that or any other payment by the\r\nGovernor-General was made in the Treasury accounts at or about the\r\ntime,\" nor is there any trace in the Company's books of its being\r\nactually paid into their treasury. It appears, then, by the confession\r\nof the said Warren Hastings, that this money was received by him; but it\r\ndoes not appear that he has converted it to the property and use of the\r\nCompany.\r\n\r\nThat in a letter from the said Warren Hastings to the said Court of\r\nDirectors, dated the 22d of May, 1782, but not dispatched, as it might\r\nand ought to have been, at that time, but detained and kept back by the\r\nsaid Warren Hastings till the 16th of December following, he has\r\nconfessed the receipt of various other sums, amounting (with that which\r\nhe accepted from the Nabob of Oude) to nearly two hundred thousand\r\npounds, which sums he affirmed had been converted to the Company's\r\nproperty through his means, but without discovering from whom or on what\r\naccount he received the same. That, instead of converting this money to\r\nthe Company's property, as he affirmed he had done, it appears that he\r\nhad lent the greater part of it to the Company upon bonds bearing\r\ninterest, which bonds were demanded and received by him, and, for aught\r\nthat yet appears, have never been given up or cancelled. That for\r\nanother considerable part of the above-mentioned sum he has taken credit\r\nto himself, as for a deposit of his own property, and therefore\r\ndemandable by him out of the Company's treasury at his discretion. That\r\nall sums so lent or deposited are not alienated from the person who\r\nlends or deposits the same; consequently, that the declaration made by\r\nthe said Warren Hastings, that he had converted the whole of these sums\r\nto the Company's property, was not true. Nor would such a transfer, if\r\nit had really been made, have justified the said Warren Hastings in\r\noriginally receiving the money, which, being in the first instance\r\ncontrary to law, could not be rendered legal by any subsequent\r\ndisposition or application thereof; much less would it have justified\r\nthe said Warren Hastings in delaying to make a discovery of these\r\ntransactions to the Court of Directors until he had heard of the\r\ninquiries then begun and proceeding in Parliament, in finally making a\r\ndiscovery, such as it is, in terms the most intricate, obscure, and\r\ncontradictory. That, instead of that full and clear explanation of his\r\nconduct which the Court of Directors demanded, and which the said Warren\r\nHastings was bound to give them, he has contented himself with telling\r\nthe said Directors, that, \"if this matter was to be exposed to the view\r\nof the public, his reasons for acting as he had done might furnish a\r\nvariety of conjectures to which it would be of little use to reply; that\r\nhe either chose to conceal the first receipts from public curiosity by\r\nreceiving bonds for the amount, or possibly acted without any studied\r\ndesign which his memory could at that distance of time verify; and that\r\nhe _could_ have concealed them from their eye and that of the public\r\nforever.\" That the discovery, as far as it goes, establishes the guilt\r\nof the said Warren Hastings in taking money against law, but does not\r\nwarrant a conclusion that he has discovered _all_ that he may have\r\ntaken; that, on the contrary, such discovery, not being made in proper\r\ntime, and when made being imperfect, perplexed, and wholly\r\nunsatisfactory, leads to a just and reasonable presumption that other\r\nfacts of the same nature have been concealed, since those which he has\r\nconfessed might have been forever, and that this partial confession was\r\neither extorted from the said Warren Hastings by the dread of detection,\r\nor made with a view of removing suspicion, and preventing any further\r\ninquiry into his conduct.\r\n\r\nThat the said Warren Hastings, in a letter to the Court of Directors\r\ndated 21st of February, 1784, has confessed his having _privately\r\nreceived_ another sum of money, the amount of which he has not declared,\r\nbut which, from the application he says he has made of it, could not be\r\nless than thirty-four thousand pounds sterling. That he has not informed\r\nthe Directors from whom he received this money, at what time, nor on\r\nwhat account; but, on the contrary, has attempted to justify the receipt\r\nof it, which was illegal, by the application of it, which was\r\nunauthorized and unwarrantable, and which, if admitted as a reason for\r\nreceiving money _privately_, would constitute a precedent of the most\r\ndangerous nature to the Company's service. That, in attempting to\r\njustify the receipt and application of the said money, he has endeavored\r\nto establish principles of conduct in a Governor which tend to subvert\r\nall order and regularity in the conduct of public business, to\r\nencourage and facilitate fraud and corruption in all offices of\r\npecuniary trust, and to defeat all inquiry into the misconduct of any\r\nperson in whom pecuniary trust is reposed.--That the said Warren\r\nHastings, in his letter above mentioned, has made a declaration to the\r\nCourt of Directors in the following terms: \"Having had occasion to\r\ndisburse from my own cash many sums, which, though required to enable me\r\nto execute the duties of my station, I have hitherto omitted to enter in\r\nmy public accounts, and my own fortune being unequal to so heavy a\r\ncharge, I have resolved to reimburse myself in a mode the most suitable\r\nto the situation of your affairs, by charging the same in my Durbar\r\naccounts of the present year, and crediting them by a sum _privately\r\nreceived_, and appropriated to your service in the same manner with\r\nother sums received on account of the Honorable Company, and already\r\ncarried to their account.\" That at the time of writing this letter the\r\nsaid Warren Hastings had been in possession of the government of Fort\r\nWilliam about twelve years, with a clear salary, or avowed emoluments,\r\nat no time less than twenty-five thousand pounds sterling a year,\r\nexclusive of which all the principal expenses of his residence were paid\r\nfor by the Company. That, if the services mentioned by him were required\r\nto enable him to execute the duties of his station, he ought not to have\r\nomitted to enter them in his public accounts at the times when the\r\nexpenses were incurred. That, if it was true, as he affirms, that, when\r\nhe first engaged in these expenses, he had no intention to carry them to\r\nthe account of the Company, there was no subsequent change in his\r\nsituation which could justify his departing from that intention. That,\r\nif his own fortune in the year 1784 was unequal to so heavy a charge,\r\nthe state of his fortune at any earlier period must have been still more\r\nunequal to so heavy a charge. That the fact so asserted by the said\r\nWarren Hastings leads directly to an inference palpably false and\r\nabsurd, viz., that, the longer a Governor-General holds that lucrative\r\noffice, the poorer he must become. That neither would the assertion, if\r\nit were true, nor the inference, if it were admitted, justify the\r\nconduct avowed by the said Warren Hastings in resolving to reimburse\r\nhimself out of the Company's property without their consent or\r\nknowledge.--That the account transmitted in this letter is styled by\r\nhimself _an aggregate of a contingent account of twelve years_; that all\r\ncontingent accounts should be submitted to those who ought to have an\r\nofficial control over them, at annual or other shorter periods, in order\r\nthat the expense already incurred may be checked and examined, and\r\nsimilar expenses, if disapproved of, may be prohibited in time; that,\r\nafter a very long period is elapsed, all check and control over such\r\nexpenses is impracticable, and, if it were practicable in the present\r\ninstance, would be completely useless, since the said Warren Hastings,\r\nwithout waiting for the consent of the Directors, did _resolve to\r\nreimburse himself_. That the conduct of the said Warren Hastings, in\r\nwithholding these accounts for twelve years together, and then resolving\r\nto reimburse himself without the consent of his employers, has been\r\nfraudulent in the first instance, and in the second amounts to a denial\r\nand mockery of the authority placed over him by law; and that he has\r\nthereby set a dangerous example to his successors, and to every man in\r\ntrust or office under him.--That the mode in which he has reimbursed\r\nhimself is a crime of a much higher order, and greatly aggravates\r\nwhatever was already criminal in the other parts of this transaction.\r\nThat the said Warren Hastings, in declaring that he should reimburse\r\nhimself by crediting the Company by _a sum privately received_, has\r\nacknowledged himself guilty of an illegal act in receiving money\r\n_privately_. That he has suppressed or withheld every particular which\r\ncould throw any light on a conduct so suspicious in a Governor as the\r\n_private_ receipt of money. That the general confession of the private\r\nreceipt of a large sum in gross, in which no circumstance of time,\r\nplace, occasion, or person, nor even the amount, is specified, tends to\r\ncover or protect any act of the same nature (as far as a general\r\nconfession can protect such acts) which may be detected hereafter, and\r\nwhich in fact may not make part of the gross sum so confessed, and that\r\nit tends to perplex and defeat all inquiry into such practices.--That\r\nthe said Warren Hastings, in stating to the Directors that he has\r\nresolved to reimburse himself in _a mode the most suitable to the\r\nsituation of their affairs_, viz., by receiving money privately against\r\nlaw, has stated a presumption highly injurious to the integrity of the\r\nsaid Directors, viz., that they will not object to, or even inquire\r\ninto, any extraordinary expenses incurred and charged by their Governors\r\nin India, provided such expenses are reimbursed by money privately and\r\nillegally received. That he has not explained what that situation of\r\ntheir affairs was or could be to which so dangerous and corrupt a\r\nprinciple was or might be applied.--That no evidence has been produced\r\nto prove that it was true, nor any ground of argument stated to show\r\nthat it might be credible, that any native of India had voluntarily and\r\ngratuitously given money privately to the said Warren Hastings, that is,\r\nwithout some prospect of a benefit in return, or some dread of his\r\nresentment, if he refused. That it is not a thing to be believed, that\r\nany native would give large sums privately to a Governor, which he\r\nrefused to give or lend publicly to government, unless it were to derive\r\nsome adequate secret advantage from the favor, or to avoid some mischief\r\nfrom the enmity of such Governor.--That the late confessions made by the\r\nsaid Warren Hastings of money received against law are no proof that he\r\ndid not originally intend to appropriate the same to his own use, such\r\nconfessions having been made at a suspicious moment, when, and not\r\nbefore, he was apprised of the inquiries commenced in the House of\r\nCommons, and when a dread of the consequence of those inquiries might\r\nact upon his mind. That such confessions, from the obscure, intricate,\r\nand contradictory manner in which they are made, imply guilt in the said\r\nWarren Hastings, as far as they go; that they do not furnish any color\r\nof reason to conclude that he has confessed all the money which he may\r\nhave corruptly received; but that, on the contrary, they warrant a just\r\nand reasonable presumption, that, in discovering some part of the bribes\r\nhe had received, he hoped to lull suspicion, and thereby conceal and\r\nsecure the rest.\r\n\r\nThat the Court of Directors, when the former accounts of these\r\ntransactions came before them, did show an evident disposition not to\r\ncensure the said Warren Hastings, but to give the most favorable\r\nconstruction to his conduct; that, nevertheless, they found themselves\r\nobliged \"to confess that the statement of those transactions appeared to\r\nthem in many parts so _unintelligible_, that they felt themselves under\r\nthe necessity of calling on the Governor-General for an explanation,\r\nagreeably to his promise voluntarily made to them.\" That their letter,\r\ncontaining this requisition, was received in Bengal in the month of\r\nAugust, 1784, and that the said Warren Hastings did not embark for\r\nEngland until the 2d of February, 1785, but made no reply to that letter\r\nbefore his departure, owing, as he has since said, _to a variety of\r\nother more important occupations_. That, under pretence of such\r\noccupations, he neglected to transmit to the Court of Directors a copy\r\nof a paper which, he says, contained the _only_ account he ever kept of\r\nthe transaction. That such a paper, or a copy of it, might have been\r\ntransmitted without interrupting other important occupations, if any\r\ncould be more important than that of giving a clear and satisfactory\r\nanswer to the requisition of the Directors. That since his arrival in\r\nEngland he has written a letter to the chairman of that court,\r\nprofessedly in answer to their letter above mentioned, but in fact\r\ngiving no explanation or satisfaction whatsoever on the points which\r\nthey had declared to be unintelligible. That the terms of his letter are\r\nambiguous and obscure, such as a guilty man might have recourse to in\r\norder to cover his guilt, but such as no innocent man, from whom nothing\r\nwas required but to clear his innocence by giving plain answers to plain\r\nquestions, could possibly have made use of. That in his letter of the\r\n11th of July, 1785, he says, \"that he has been kindly apprised that the\r\ninformation required as above _was yet expected from him_: that the\r\nsubmission which his respect would have enjoined him to pay to the\r\ncommand imposed on him _was lost to his recollection_, perhaps from the\r\nstronger impression which the first and distant perusal of it had left\r\non his mind that it was rather intended as a reprehension for something\r\nwhich had given offence in his report of the original transaction than\r\nas expressive of any want of a further elucidation of it.\"[2]\r\n\r\nThat the said Warren Hastings, in affecting to doubt whether the\r\ninformation expressly required of him by his employers was expected or\r\nnot, has endeavored to justify a criminal delay and evasion in giving\r\nit. That, considering the importance of the subject, and the recent date\r\nof the command, it is not possible _that it could be lost to his\r\nrecollection_; much less is it possible that he could have understood\r\nthe specific demand of an answer to specific questions to be intended\r\nonly as a reprehension for a former offence, viz., the offence of\r\nwithholding from the Directors that very explanation which he ought to\r\nhave given in the first instance. That the said Warren Hastings, in his\r\nanswer to the said questions, cautiously avoids affirming or denying\r\nanything in clear, positive terms, and professes to recollect nothing\r\nwith absolute certainty. That he has not, even now, informed the\r\nDirectors of the name of any one person from whom any part of the money\r\nin question was received, nor what was the motive of any one person for\r\ngiving the same. That he has, indeed, declared, that his motive for\r\nlending to the Company, or depositing in their treasury in his own name,\r\nmoney which he has in other places declared to be their property, was to\r\navoid ostentation, and that _lending_ the money was _the least liable\r\nto reflection_; yet, when he has stated these and other conjectural\r\nmotives for his own conduct, he declares _he will not affirm, though he\r\nis firmly persuaded, that those were his sentiments on the occasion_.\r\nThat of one thing only the said Warren Hastings declares he is\r\n_certain_, viz., \"that it was his design originally to have _concealed_\r\nthe receipt of all the sums, except the second, even from the knowledge\r\nof the Court of Directors, but that, when fortune threw a sum in his way\r\nof a magnitude _which could not be concealed_, and the peculiar delicacy\r\nof his situation at the time in which he received it made him more\r\ncircumspect of appearances, he _chose_ to apprise his employers of it.\"\r\nThat the said Warren Hastings informs the Directors, that he had\r\nindorsed the bonds taken by him for money belonging to the Company, and\r\nlent by him to the Company, _in order to guard against their becoming a\r\nclaim on the Company, as part of his estate, in the event of his death_;\r\nbut he has not affirmed, nor does it anywhere appear, that he has\r\nsurrendered the said bonds, as he ought to have done. That the said\r\nWarren Hastings, in affirming that he had not time to answer the\r\nquestions put to him by the Directors, while he was in Bengal,--in not\r\nbringing with him to England the documents necessary to enable him to\r\nanswer those questions, or in pretending that he has not brought\r\nthem,--in referring the Directors back again to Bengal for those\r\ndocuments, and for any further information on a subject on which he has\r\ngiven them no information,--and particularly in referring them back to a\r\nperson in Bengal for a paper which he says contained the _only_ account\r\nhe ever kept of the transaction, while he himself professes to doubt\r\nwhether that paper _be still in being_, whether _it be in the hands_ of\r\nthat person, or whether that person _can recollect anything distinctly\r\nconcerning it_,--has been guilty of gross evasions, and of palpable\r\nprevarication and deceit, as well as of contumacy and disobedience to\r\nthe lawful orders of the Court of Directors, and thereby confirmed all\r\nthe former evidence of his having constantly used the influence of his\r\nstation for the most scandalous, illegal, and corrupt purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.--RESIGNATION OF THE OFFICE OF GOVERNOR-GENERAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat Warren Hastings having by his agent, Lauchlan Macleane, Esquire, on\r\nthe 10th day of October, in the year 1776, \"signified to the Court of\r\nDirectors his desire to resign his office of Governor-General of Bengal,\r\nand requested their nomination of a successor to the vacancy which would\r\nbe thereby occasioned in the Supreme Council,\" the Court of Directors\r\ndid thereupon desire the said Lauchlan Macleane \"to inform them of the\r\nauthority under which he acted in a point of such very great\r\nimportance\"; and the said Lauchlan Macleane \"signifying thereupon his\r\nreadiness to give the court every possible satisfaction on that subject,\r\nbut the powers with which he was intrusted by the papers in his custody\r\nbeing mixed with other matters of a nature extremely confidential, he\r\nwould submit the same to the inspection of any three of the members of\r\nthe court,\" the said Court of Directors empowered the Chairman, Deputy\r\nChairman, and Richard Becher, Esquire, to inspect the authorities,\r\npowers, and directions with which Mr. Macleane was furnished by Mr.\r\nHastings to make the propositions contained in his letter of the 10th\r\nOctober, 1776, and to report their opinion thereon. And the said\r\ncommittee did accordingly, on the 23d of the said month, report, \"that,\r\nhaving conferred with Mr. Macleane on the subject of his letter\r\npresented to the court the 11th instant, they found, that, from the\r\npurport of Mr. Hastings's instructions, contained in a paper in his own\r\nhandwriting given to Mr. Macleane, and produced by him to them, Mr.\r\nHastings declared he would not continue in the government of Bengal,\r\nunless certain conditions therein specified could be obtained, of which\r\nthey saw no probability; and Mr. George Vansittart had declared to them,\r\nthat he was present when these instructions were given to Mr. Macleane,\r\nand when Mr. Hastings empowered Mr. Macleane to declare his resignation\r\nto the said court; that Mr. Stewart had likewise confirmed to them, that\r\nMr. Hastings declared to him, that he had given directions to the above\r\npurpose by Mr. Macleane.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the Court of Directors, having received from the said report due\r\nsatisfaction respecting the authority vested in the said Lauchlan\r\nMacleane to propose the said resignation of the office of\r\nGovernor-General of Bengal, did unanimously resolve to accept the same,\r\nand did also, under powers vested in the said court by the act of the\r\n13th year of his present Majesty, \"nominate and appoint Edward Wheler,\r\nEsquire, to succeed to the office in the Council of Fort William in\r\nBengal which will become vacant by the said resignation, if such\r\nnomination shall be approved by his Majesty\": which nomination and\r\nappointment was afterwards in due form approved and confirmed by his\r\nMajesty.\r\n\r\nThat the Court of Directors did, by a postscript to their general\r\nletter, dated 25th October, 1776, acquaint the Governor-General and\r\nCouncil at Calcutta of their acceptance of the said resignation, of\r\ntheir appointment of Edward Wheler, Esquire, to fill the said vacancy,\r\nand of his Majesty's approbation of the said appointment, together with\r\nthe grounds of their said proceedings; and did transmit to the said\r\nGovernor-General and Council copies of the said instruments of\r\nappointment and confirmation.\r\n\r\nThat the said dispatches from the Court of Directors were received at\r\nCalcutta, and were read in Council on the 19th day of June, in the year\r\n1777; and that Warren Hastings, Esquire, having taken no steps to yield\r\nthe government to his successor, General Clavering, and having observed\r\na profound silence on the subject of the said dispatches, he, the said\r\nGeneral Clavering, did, on the next day, being the 20th of June, by a\r\nletter addressed to the said Warren Hastings, require him to surrender\r\nthe keys of Fort William, and of the Company's treasuries; but the said\r\nWarren Hastings did positively refuse to comply with the said\r\nrequisition, \"denying that his office was vacated, and declaring his\r\nresolution to assert and maintain his authority by every legal means.\"\r\n\r\nThat the said General Clavering, conceiving that the office of\r\nGovernor-General was vacated by the arrival of the said dispatches,\r\nwhich acquainted the Council-General of the resignation of the said\r\nWarren Hastings and the appointment of the said Edward Wheler, Esquire,\r\nand that he, the said General Clavering, had in consequence thereof\r\nlegally succeeded, under the provisions of the act of the 13th year of\r\nhis present Majesty's reign, to the said office of Governor-General,\r\nbecome vacant in the manner aforesaid, did, in virtue thereof, issue in\r\nhis own name summonses to Richard Barwell, Esquire, and Philip Francis,\r\nEsquire, members of the Council, to attend the same, and in the presence\r\nof the said Philip Francis, Esquire, who obeyed the said summons, did\r\ntake the oaths as Governor-General, and did sit and preside in Council\r\nas Governor-General, and prepared several acts and resolutions in the\r\nsaid capacity of Governor-General, and did, amongst other things,\r\nprepare a proclamation to be made of his said succession to the\r\ngovernment, and of its commencing from the date of the said\r\nproclamation, but did not carry any of the acts or resolutions so\r\nprepared into execution.\r\n\r\nThe said Warren Hastings did, notwithstanding thereof, and in pursuance\r\nof his resolution to assert and maintain his authority, illegally and\r\nunjustifiably summon the Council to meet in another department, and did\r\nsit and preside therein, apart from the said General Clavering and his\r\nCouncil, and, in conjunction with Richard Barwell, Esquire, who\r\nconcurred therein, issued sundry orders and did sundry acts of\r\ngovernment belonging to the office of Governor-General, and, amongst\r\nothers, did order several letters to be written in the name of the\r\nGovernor-General and Council, and did subscribe the same, to the\r\ncommandant of the garrison of Fort William, and to the commanding\r\nofficer at Barrackpore, and to the commanding officers at the other\r\nstations, and also to the provincial councils and collectors in the\r\nprovinces, enjoining them severally \"to obey no orders excepting such as\r\nshould be signed by the said Warren Hastings, or a majority of his\r\nCouncil.\"\r\n\r\nThat the said Warren Hastings did, by the said proceedings, which were\r\ncontrary both to law and to good faith, constitute a double government,\r\nthereby destroying and annihilating all government whatever; and, by his\r\nsaid orders to the military officers, did prepare for open resistance by\r\narms, exposing thereby the settlement, and all the inhabitants, subjects\r\nof or dependent on the British government, whether native or European,\r\nnot only to political distractions, but to the horrors of civil war; and\r\ndid, by exposing the divisions and weakness of the supreme government,\r\nand thereby loosening the obedience of the provinces, shake the whole\r\nfoundation of British authority, and imminently endanger the existence\r\nof the British nation in India.\r\n\r\nThat the said evils were averted only by the moderation of the said\r\nGeneral Clavering and Philip Francis, Esquire, in consenting to a\r\nreference, and submitting to the decision of the judges of the Supreme\r\nCourt of Judicature, although they entertained no doubts themselves on\r\nthe legality of their proceedings and the validity of General\r\nClavering's instant right to the chair, and although they were not in\r\nany way bound by law to consult the said judges, who had no legal or\r\njudicial authority therein in virtue of their offices or as a court of\r\njustice, but were consulted, and interposed their advice, only as\r\nindividuals, by the voluntary reference of the parties in the said\r\ndispute. And the said Warren Hastings, by his declaration, entered in\r\nMinutes of Council, \"that it was his determination to abide by the\r\nopinion of the judges,\" and by the measures he had previously taken as\r\naforesaid to enforce the same by arms, did risk all the dangerous\r\nconsequences above mentioned: which must have taken place, if the said\r\nGeneral Clavering and Philip Francis, Esquire, had not been more tender\r\nof the public interests, and less tenacious of their own rights, and had\r\npersisted in their claim, as they were by law entitled to do, the\r\nextra-judicial interposition of the judges notwithstanding; and from\r\nwhich claim they receded only from their desire to preserve the peace of\r\nthe settlement, and to prevent the mischiefs which the illegal\r\nresistance of the said Warren Hastings would otherwise infallibly have\r\noccasioned.\r\n\r\nThat, after the said judges had delivered their opinion, \"that the place\r\nand office of Governor-General of this Presidency had not yet been\r\nvacated by Warren Hastings, and that the actual assumption of the\r\ngovernment by the member of the Council next in succession to Mr.\r\nHastings, in consequence of any deduction which could be made from the\r\npapers communicated to them, would be absolutely illegal,\" and after the\r\nsaid General Clavering and Philip Francis, Esquire, had signified to the\r\nsaid Warren Hastings, by a letter dated the 21st of June, \"their\r\nintention to acquiesce in the said opinion of the judges,\" and when the\r\ndifferences in the Supreme Council were by these means composed, and the\r\ncalamities consequent thereon were avoided, the said Warren Hastings and\r\nRichard Barwell, Esquires, did once more endanger the public peace and\r\nsecurity by other illegal, unwarrantable, and unprovoked acts of\r\nviolence: having omitted to summon either the said General Clavering or\r\nthe said Philip Francis, Esquire, to Council; and having, in a Council\r\nheld thus privately and clandestinely and contrary to law, on the 22d\r\nday of June, come to the following resolutions, viz.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That, by the said acts, orders, and declarations of\r\nLieutenant-General John Clavering, recited in the foregoing papers,\"\r\n(meaning the proceedings of General Clavering in his separate Council on\r\nthe 20th of June,) \"he has actually usurped and assumed and taken\r\npossession of the place and office of Governor-General of the Presidency\r\nof Fort William in Bengal, granted by the act of the 13th of his present\r\nMajesty to Warren Hastings, Esquire.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That Lieutenant-General John Clavering has thereby\r\nrelinquished, resigned, surrendered, and vacated the office of Senior\r\nCounsellor of Fort William in Bengal.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That Lieutenant-General John Clavering has thereby\r\nrelinquished, resigned, surrendered, and vacated his place of\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Company's forces in India.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That Richard Barwell, Esquire, by virtue of the said act of\r\nParliament, and by the death of the Honorable George Monson, Esquire, is\r\npromoted to the office of Senior Counsellor of the Presidency of Fort\r\nWilliam in Bengal, in consequence of the said relinquishment,\r\nresignation, surrender, and vacation of General Clavering.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That the office of Commander-in-Chief of the Company's forces\r\nin India, by the relinquishment, resignation, surrender, and vacation of\r\nGeneral Clavering, and by the death of the Honorable George Monson,\r\nEsquire, does no longer exist.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That, for the preservation of the legality of our\r\nproceedings, Lieutenant-General John Clavering be not in future summoned\r\nor admitted as a member of the Governor-General and Council.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the said Warren Hastings and Richard Barwell, Esquire, did again\r\nsit in Council on the next day, being the 23d of June, without summoning\r\neither General Clavering or Philip Francis, Esquire, and did come to\r\nseveral other resolutions, and make several orders, contrary to law or\r\njustice, and inconsistent with the tranquillity and the security of the\r\nsettlement: that is to say, they ordered their secretary \"to notify to\r\nGeneral Clavering that the board had declared his offices of Senior\r\nCounsellor and Commander-in-Chief to be vacant, and to furnish him with\r\na copy of these proceedings, containing the grounds of the board for the\r\naforesaid declaration.\"\r\n\r\nAnd they ordered extracts of the said proceedings \"to be issued in\r\ngeneral orders, with letters to all the provincial councils and military\r\nstations, directing them to publish the same in general orders\"; and\r\nthey resolved, \"that all military returns be made to the\r\nGovernor-General and Council in their military department, until a\r\ncommander-in-chief shall be appointed by the Company.\"\r\n\r\nThat on the day following, that is to say, on the 24th of June, the said\r\nWarren Hastings did again omit to summon General Clavering to Council,\r\nand did again, together with Richard Barwell, Esquire, who concurred\r\ntherein, adhere to and confirm the said illegal resolutions come to on\r\nthe two former days, declaring \"that they could not be retracted but by\r\nthe present authority of the law or by future orders from home,\" and\r\naggravating the guilt of the said unjustifiable acts by declaring, as\r\nthe said Warren Hastings did, \"that they were not the precipitate\r\neffects of an instant and passionate impulse, but the fruits of long and\r\nmost temperate deliberations, of inevitable necessity, of the strictest\r\nsense of public duty, and of a conviction equal in its impression on\r\nhis mind to absolute certainty.\"\r\n\r\nThat the said Warren Hastings was the less excusable in this obstinate\r\nadherence to his former unjust proceedings, as the said declarations\r\nwere made in answer to a motion made by Philip Francis, Esquire, for the\r\nreversal of the said proceedings, and to a minute introducing the said\r\nmotion, in which Mr. Francis set forth in a clear and forcible manner,\r\nand in terms with which the Court of Directors have since declared their\r\nentire concurrence, both the extreme danger and the illegality and\r\ninvalidity of the said proceedings of Warren Hastings and Richard\r\nBarwell, Esquire, concluding the said minute by the following\r\nconciliatory declaration: \"And that this salutary motion may not be\r\nimpeded by any idea or suspicion that General Clavering may do any act\r\ninconsistent with the acquiescence which both he and I have avowed in\r\nthe decision of the judges, I will undertake to answer for him in this\r\nrespect, or that, if he should depart from the true spirit and meaning\r\nof that acquiescence, I will not be a party with him in such\r\nproceedings.\"\r\n\r\nThat the said Warren Hastings could not plead ignorance of the law in\r\nexcuse for the said illegal acts, as it appears from the proceedings of\r\nthe four preceding days that he was well acquainted with the tenure by\r\nwhich the members of the Council held their offices under the act of the\r\n13th of his present Majesty, and had stated the same as a ground for\r\nretaining his own office, contrary to an express declaration of the\r\nCourt of Directors and an instrument under the sign-manual of his\r\nMajesty; and the judges of the Supreme Court, in their reasons for their\r\ndecision in his favor, had stated the provisions in the said act,[3] so\r\nfar as they related to the matter in dispute, from which it appeared\r\nthat there were but four grounds on which the office of any member of\r\nthe Council could be vacated,--namely, death, removal, resignation, or\r\npromotion. And as the act confined the power of removal to \"his Majesty,\r\nhis heirs and successors, upon representation made by the Court of\r\nDirectors of the said United Company for the time being,\" and conferred\r\nno such power on the Governor-General, or a majority of the Council, to\r\nremove, on any ground or for any cause whatever, one of their\r\ncolleagues,--so, granting the claim of General Clavering to the chair,\r\nand his acts done in furtherance thereof, to have been illegal, and\r\ncriminal in whatever degree, yet it did not furnish to the rest of the\r\nCouncil any ground to remove him from his office of Counsellor under the\r\nprovisions of the said act; and there could therefore remain only his\r\n_resignation_ or _promotion_, as a possible means of vacating his said\r\noffice. But with regard to the promotion of General Clavering to the\r\noffice of Governor-General, although he claimed it himself, yet, as Mr.\r\nHastings did not admit it, and as in fact it was even receded from by\r\nGeneral Clavering, it could not be considered, at least by Mr. Hastings,\r\nas a valid ground for vacating his office of Senior Counsellor, since\r\nthe act requires for that purpose, not a rejected claim, but an actual\r\nand effectual promotion; and General Clavering's office of Counsellor\r\ncould no more be vacated by such a naked claim, unsupported and\r\ndisallowed, than the seat of a member of the House of Commons could be\r\nvacated, and a new writ issued to supply the vacancy, by his claim to\r\nthe office of Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds, when his Majesty has\r\nrefused to appoint him to the said office. And with regard to\r\nresignation, although the said Warren Hastings, as a color to his\r\nillegal resolutions, had affectedly introduced the word \"resigned\"\r\namongst those of \"relinquished, surrendered, and vacated,\" yet he well\r\nknew that General Clavering had made no offer nor declaration of his\r\nresignation of his offices of Senior Counsellor and Commander-in-Chief,\r\nand that he did not claim the office of Governor-General on the ground\r\nof any such resignation made by himself, but on the ground of a\r\nresignation made by the said Warren Hastings, which resignation the said\r\nWarren Hastings did not admit; and the use of the term _resigned_ on\r\nthat occasion was therefore a manifest and wilful misconstruction and\r\nmisapplication of the words of the act of his present Majesty. And such\r\nmisinterpretation and false extension of the term of resignation was the\r\nmore indecent in the said Warren Hastings, as he was at the same moment\r\ndisavowing and refusing to give effect to his own clear and express\r\nresignation, according to the true intent and meaning of the word as\r\nused in the said act, made by his agent, duly authorized and instructed\r\nby himself so to do, to an authority competent to receive and accept the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\nThat, although the said Warren Hastings did afterwards recede from the\r\nsaid illegal measures, in compliance with the opinion and advice of the\r\njudges again interposed, and did thereby avoid the guilt of such further\r\nacts and the blame of such further evils as must have been consequent on\r\na persistence therein, yet he was nevertheless still guilty of the\r\nillegal acts above described; and the same are great crimes and\r\nmisdemeanors.\r\n\r\nThat, although the judges did decide that the office of\r\nGovernor-General, held by the said Warren Hastings, was not _ipso facto_\r\nand _instanter_ vacated by the arrival of the said dispatches and\r\ndocuments transmitted by the Court of Directors, and did consider the\r\nsaid consequences of the resignation as awaiting some future act or\r\nevent for its complete and effectual operation, yet the said judges did\r\nnot declare any opinion on the ultimate invalidity of the said acts of\r\nLauchlan Macleane, Esquire, as not being binding on his principal,\r\nWarren Hastings, Esquire; nor did they declare any opinion that the\r\nobligation of the said resignation was not from the beginning conclusive\r\nand effectual, although its operation was, from the necessity of the\r\ncase, on account of the distance between England and India, to take\r\nplace only in future,--or that the said resignation made by Lauchlan\r\nMacleane, Esquire, was only an offer or proposal of a resignation to be\r\nmade at some future and indefinite period, or a mere intimation of the\r\ndesire of Warren Hastings, Esquire, to resign at some future and\r\nindefinite period, and that the said resignation, notwithstanding the\r\nacceptance thereof by the Court of Directors, and the regular\r\nappointment and confirmation of a successor, was still to remain\r\noptional in the said Warren Hastings, to be ratified or departed from at\r\nhis future choice or pleasure; nor did the said judges pronounce, nor do\r\nany of their reasonings which accompanied their decision tend to\r\nestablish it as their opinion, that even the time for ratifying and\r\ncompleting the said transaction was to be at the sole discretion of the\r\nsaid Warren Hastings; but they only delivered their opinion as\r\naforesaid, that his said office \"has not _yet_ been vacated, and\r\n[therefore] that the _actual_ assumption of the government by the\r\nmember of the Council next in succession was [in the actual\r\ncircumstances, and _rebus sic stantibus_] illegal.\"\r\n\r\nThat the said Warren Hastings does nowhere himself contend that the said\r\nresignation was not absolute, but optional, according to the true\r\nmeaning and understanding of the parties in England, and so far as the\r\nacts of Lauchlan Macleane, Esquire, and the Court of Directors, were\r\nbinding on him; but, on the contrary, he grounds his refusal to complete\r\nthe same, not on any interpretation of the words in which the said\r\nresignation, and the other instruments aforesaid, were conceived, but\r\nrather on a disavowal (not direct, indeed, but implied) of his said\r\nagent, and of the powers under which the said agent had claimed to act\r\nin his behalf. Neither did the said Warren Hastings ground his said\r\nrefusal on any objection to the particular day or period or\r\ncircumstances in which the requisition of General Clavering was made,\r\nnor accompany the said refusal with any qualification in that respect,\r\nor with any intimation that he would at any future or more convenient\r\nseason comply with the same,--although such an intimation might probably\r\nhave induced General Clavering to waive an instant and immediate claim\r\nto the chair, and might therefore have prevented the distractions which\r\nhappened, and the greater evils which impended, in consequence of the\r\nsaid claim of General Clavering, and the said refusal of Warren\r\nHastings, Esquire; but the said Warren Hastings did, on the contrary,\r\nexpress his said refusal in such general and unqualified terms as\r\nintimated an intention to resist absolutely and altogether, both then\r\nand at any future time, the said requisition of General Clavering. And\r\nthe subsequent proceedings of the said Warren Hastings do all concur in\r\nproving that such was his intention; for he did afterwards, in\r\nconformity to the advice of the judges, move a resolution in Council,\r\n\"that all parties be placed in the same situation in which they stood\r\nbefore the receipt of the last advices from England, reserving and\r\nsubmitting to a decision in England the respective claims that each\r\nparty may conceive they have a right to make, but not acting upon those\r\nclaims till such decision shall arrive in Bengal\": thereby clearly and\r\nexplicitly declaring that it was not his intention to surrender the\r\ngovernment until such decision should arrive in Bengal, which could not\r\nbe expected in less time than a year and a half after the date of the\r\nsaid resolution; and thereby clearly and explicitly declaring that he\r\ndid not consider his resignation as binding for the present. And the\r\nsaid intention was manifested, if possible, still more directly and\r\nexpressly in a letter written by the said Warren Hastings to the Court\r\nof Directors, dated the 15th of August, 1777, being almost two months\r\nafter the receipt of the said dispatches, in which the said Warren\r\nHastings declares that \"he did not hold himself bound by the\r\nnotification made by Mr. Macleane, nor by any of the acts consequent of\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nThat, such appearing to have been the intention of the said Warren\r\nHastings, General Clavering was justified in immediately assuming the\r\ngovernment, without waiting for any future act of the said Warren\r\nHastings for the actual surrender of the said government, none such\r\nbeing likely to happen; and Philip Francis, Esquire, was justified in\r\nsupporting General Clavering in the same on the soundest principles of\r\njustice, and on a maxim received in courts of equity, namely, that no\r\none shall avail himself of his own wrong,--and that, if any one refuse\r\nor neglect to perform that which he is bound to do, the rights of others\r\nshall not be prejudiced thereby, but such acts shall be deemed and\r\nreputed to have been actually performed, and all the consequences shall\r\nbe enforced which would have followed from such actual performance. And\r\ntherefore the resolutions moved and voted in Council by the said Warren\r\nHastings, declaring the offices of General Clavering to be vacant, were\r\nnot only illegal, inasmuch as the said Warren Hastings had no authority\r\nto warrant such a declaration, even on the supposition of the acts of\r\nGeneral Clavering being contrary to law, but the said resolutions were\r\nfurther highly culpable and criminal, inasmuch as the said acts done by\r\nGeneral Clavering, which were made the pretence of that proceeding, were\r\nstrictly regular and legal.\r\n\r\nThat the refusal of the said Warren Hastings to ratify the said\r\nresignation, and his disavowal of the said Lauchlan Macleane, his agent,\r\nis not justified by anything contained in his said letter to the Court\r\nof Directors, dated on the 15th of August, 1777,--the said Warren\r\nHastings nowhere directly and positively asserting that the said\r\nLauchlan Macleane was not his agent, and had not both full and general\r\npowers, and even particular instructions for this very act, although the\r\nsaid Warren Hastings uses many indirect and circuitous, but insufficient\r\nand inapplicable, insinuations to that effect. And the said letter does,\r\non the contrary, contain a clear and express avowal that the said\r\nLauchlan Macleane was his confidential agent, and that in that capacity\r\nhe acted throughout, and particularly in this special matter, with zeal\r\nand fidelity. And the said letter does further admit in effect the\r\ninstructions produced by the said Lauchlan Macleane, Esquire, confirmed\r\nby Mr. Vansittart and Mr. Stewart, and relied on and confided in by the\r\nCourt of Directors, by which the said Lauchlan Macleane appeared to be\r\nspecially empowered to declare the said resignation, the words of the\r\nsaid instruction being as follows: \"That he [Mr. Hastings] _will not\r\ncontinue in the government of Bengal_, unless certain conditions therein\r\nspecified can be obtained\"; and the words of the said letter being as\r\nfollows: \"What I myself know with certainty, or can recollect at this\r\ndistance of time, concerning the powers and instructions which were\r\ngiven to Messieurs Macleane and Graham, when they undertook to be my\r\nagents in England, I will circumstantially relate. I am in possession of\r\ntwo papers which were presented to those gentlemen at the time of their\r\ndeparture from Bengal, one of which comprises four short propositions\r\n_which I required as the conditions of my being confirmed in this\r\ngovernment_.\" And although the said Warren Hastings does here artfully\r\nsomewhat change the words of his written instructions (and which having\r\nin his possession he might as easily have given verbatim) to other words\r\nwhich may appear less explicit, yet they are in fact capable of only the\r\nsame meaning: for, as, at the time of giving the said instructions to\r\nhis agents, he was in full possession of his office, he could want no\r\nconfirmation therein except _his own_; and, in such circumstances, \"to\r\nrequire certain things, _as the conditions of his being confirmed in his\r\ngovernment_,\" is tantamount to a declaration \"_that he will not continue\r\nin his government, unless those conditions can be obtained_.\" And the\r\nsaid attempt at prevarication can serve, its author the less, as either\r\nboth sentences have one and the same meaning, or, if their meaning be\r\ndifferent, the original instructions in his own handwriting, or, in\r\nother words, the thing itself, must be preferred as evidence of its\r\ncontents to a loose statement of its purport, founded, perhaps, on a\r\nloose recollection of it at a great distance of time.\r\n\r\nThat the said refusal of Warren Hastings, Esquire, was a breach of faith\r\nwith the Court of Directors and his Majesty's ministers in England; as\r\nthe said resignation was not merely a voluntary offer without any\r\nconsideration, and therefore subject to be recalled or retracted at the\r\npleasure of the said Warren Hastings, but ought rather to be considered\r\nas having been the result of a negotiation carried on between Mr.\r\nMacleane for the benefit of Warren Hastings, Esquire, on the one hand,\r\nand by the Court of Directors for the interests of the Company on the\r\nother: which view of the transaction will appear the more probable, when\r\nit is considered that at the time of the said resignation a strict\r\ninquiry had been carrying on by the Court of Directors into the conduct\r\nof the said Warren Hastings, and the solicitor and counsel to the\r\nCompany, and other eminent counsel, had given it as their opinions, on\r\ncases stated to them, that there were grounds for suing the said Warren\r\nHastings in the courts of law and equity, and that the Company would be\r\nentitled to recover in the said suits against Warren Hastings, Esquire,\r\nseveral very large sums of money taken by him in his office of\r\nGovernor-General, contrary to law, and in breach of his covenants, and\r\nof his duty to the Company and the public; and the Court of Directors\r\nhad also come to various severe resolutions of censure against the said\r\nWarren Hastings, and amongst others to a resolution to recall the said\r\nWarren Hastings, and remove him from his office of Governor-General, to\r\nanswer for sundry great crimes and delinquencies by him committed in his\r\nsaid office. And on these accounts it appears probable that the said\r\nresignation was tendered and accepted as a consideration for some\r\nbeneficial concessions made in consequence thereof to the said Warren\r\nHastings in his said dangerous and desperate condition.\r\n\r\nAnd the said refusal was also an act of great disrespect to the Court of\r\nDirectors and to his Majesty, and, by rendering abortive their said\r\nmeasures, solemnly and deliberately taken, and ratified and confirmed by\r\nhis Majesty, tended to bring the authority of the Court of Directors and\r\nof his Majesty into contempt.\r\n\r\nAnd the said refusal was an injury to General Clavering.\r\n\r\nAnd was also, or might have been, a great injury to Edward Wheler,\r\nEsquire.\r\n\r\nAnd was an act of signal treachery to Lauchlan Macleane, Esquire, as\r\nalso to Mr. Vansittart and Mr. Stewart, whose honors and veracity were\r\nthereby brought into question, doubt, and suspicion.\r\n\r\nAnd the said refusal was prejudicial to the affairs of the servants of\r\nthe Company in India, by shaking the confidence to be placed in their\r\nagents by those persons with whom it might be for their interests to\r\nnegotiate on any matter of importance, and by thus subjecting the\r\ncommunication of persons abroad with those at home to difficulties not\r\nknown before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX.--SURGEON-GENERAL'S CONTRACT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat the said Warren Hastings, in the year 1777, did grant to the\r\nSurgeon-General a contract for three years, for defraying every kind of\r\nhospital and medicinal expense,--not only in breach of the general\r\norders of the Court of Directors with respect to the duration of\r\ncontracts, but in direct opposition to a particular order of the Court\r\nof Directors, of the 30th of March, 1774, when they directed \"that the\r\nSurgeon should not be permitted to enjoy any emolument arising from his\r\nbeing concerned in dieting the patients, and that the occupations of\r\nsurgeon and contractor should be forthwith separated.\" That the said\r\ncontract was in itself highly improper, and inconsistent with the good\r\nof the service; as it afforded the greatest temptation to abuse, and\r\nestablished a pecuniary interest in the Surgeon-General, contrary to the\r\nduties of his station and profession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.--CONTRACTS FOR POOLBUNDY REPAIRS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat the Governor-General and Council at Fort William did, on the motion\r\nand recommendation of Warren Hastings, Esquire, enter into a contract\r\nwith Archibald Frazer, Esquire, on the 16th of April, 1778, for the\r\nrepairs of the pools and banks in the province of Burdwan, for two\r\nyears, at the rate of 120,000 sicca rupees for the first year, and\r\n80,000 rupees for the second year.\r\n\r\nThat on the 19th of December, 1778, the said Warren Hastings did further\r\npersuade the Supreme Council to prolong the term of the above contract\r\nwith Archibald Frazer for the space of three years more on the same\r\nconditions, namely, the payment of 80,000 sicca rupees for each year: to\r\nwhich was added a permission to Mr. Frazer to make _dobunds_, or special\r\nrepairs, whenever he should judge them necessary, at the charge of\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThat the said contracts, both in the manner of their acceptance by the\r\nSupreme Council, without having previously advertised for proposals, and\r\nin the extent of their duration, were made in direct violation of the\r\nspecial orders of the Court of Directors.\r\n\r\nThat, so far from any advantage having been obtained for the Company in\r\nthe terms of these contracts, in consideration of the length of time for\r\nwhich they were to continue, the expense of government upon this article\r\nwas increased by these engagements to a very great amount.\r\n\r\nThat it appears that this contract had been held for some years before\r\nby the Rajah of Burdwan at the rate of 25,000 rupees per annum.\r\n\r\nThat the superintendent of poolbundy repairs, after an accurate and\r\ndiligent survey of the bunds and pools, and the Provincial Council of\r\nBurdwan, upon the best information they could procure, had delivered it\r\nas their opinion to the Governor-General and Council, before the said\r\nagreement was entered into, that, after the heavy expense stated in Mr.\r\nKinlock's estimate, viz., 119,405 sicca rupees, if disbursed as they\r\nrecommended, the charge in future seasons would be greatly reduced,\r\n_and, after one thorough and effectual repair, they conceived a small\r\nannual expense would be sufficient to keep the bunds up and prevent\r\ntheir going to decay_.\r\n\r\nThat, whatever extraordinary and unusual damages the pools and bunds\r\nmight have sustained, either from the neglect of the Rajah's officers,\r\nor from the violence of the then late rains, and the torrents thereby\r\noccasioned, to justify the expense of the first year, yet, as they were\r\nall considered and included in the estimate for that year, there could\r\nbe no pretence for allowing and continuing so large and burdensome a\r\npayment as 80,000 rupees per annum for the four succeeding years.\r\n\r\nThat the said Warren Hastings did, in his minutes of the 13th of\r\nFebruary, 1778, himself support that opinion, in the comparison to be\r\nmade between Mr. Thomson's proposals, of undertaking the same service\r\nfor 60,000 rupees a year for nine years, and the terms of Mr. Frazer's\r\ncontracts: preferring the latter, because these were \"to effect a\r\ncomplete repair, which could hardly be concluded in one season, and the\r\nsubsequent expense would be but trifling.\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding which, the said Warren Hastings urged and prevailed upon\r\nthe Council to allow in the first year the full amount proposed by Mr.\r\nKinlock in his estimate of the necessary repairs, and did burden the\r\nCompany with what he must have deemed to be, for the greater part, an\r\nunnecessary expense of 80,000 rupees per annum for four years.\r\n\r\nThat the permission granted to Mr. Frazer to make dobunds, or new and\r\nadditional embankments in aid of the old ones, whenever he should judge\r\nthem necessary, at the charge of government, (the said charge to be\r\nverified by the oath of the said Frazer, without any voucher,) was a\r\npower very much to be suspected, and very improper to be intrusted to a\r\ncontractor who had already covenanted to keep the old pools in perfect\r\nrepair, and to construct new ones wherever the old pools had been\r\nbroken down and washed away, or where the course of the rivers might\r\nhave rendered new ones necessary, in consideration of the great sums\r\nstipulated to be paid to him by the government.\r\n\r\nThat the grant of the foregoing contracts, and the permission afterwards\r\nannexed to the second of the said grants, become much more reprehensible\r\nfrom a consideration of the circumstances of the person to whom such a\r\ngrant was made.\r\n\r\nThat the due performance of the service required local knowledge and\r\nexperience, which the said Archibald Frazer, being an officer in the\r\nSupreme Court of Justice, could not have possessed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.--CONTRACTS FOR OPIUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat it appears that the opium produced in Bengal and Bahar is a\r\nconsiderable and lucrative article in the export trade of those\r\nprovinces; that the whole produce has been for many years monopolized\r\neither by individuals or by the government; that the Court of Directors\r\nof the East India Company, in consideration of the hardship imposed on\r\nthe native owners and cultivators of the lands, who were deprived of\r\ntheir natural right of dealing with many competitors, and compelled to\r\nsell the produce of their labor to a single monopolist, did authorize\r\nthe Governor-General and Council to give up that commodity as an article\r\nof commerce.\r\n\r\nThat, while the said commodity continued to be a monopoly for the\r\nbenefit of government, and managed by a contractor, the contracts for\r\nproviding it were subject to the Company's fundamental regulation,\r\nnamely, to be put up to auction, and disposed of to the best bidder; and\r\nthat the Company particularly ordered that the commodity, when provided,\r\nshould be consigned to the Board of Trade, who were directed to dispose\r\nthereof by public auction.\r\n\r\nThat in May, 1777, the said Warren Hastings granted to John Mackenzie a\r\ncontract for the provision of opium, to continue three years, and\r\nwithout advertising for proposals. That this transaction was condemned\r\nby the Court of Directors, notwithstanding a clause had been inserted in\r\nthat contract by which it was left open to the Court of Directors to\r\nannul the same at the expiration of the first or second year.\r\n\r\nThat, about the end of the year 1780, the said Warren Hastings, in\r\ncontradiction to the order above mentioned, did take away the sale of\r\nthe opium from the Board of Trade, though he disclaimed, at the same\r\ntime, _any intention of implying a censure on their management_.\r\n\r\nThat in March, 1781, the said Warren Hastings did grant to Stephen\r\nSulivan, son of Lawrence Sulivan, Chairman of the Court of Directors of\r\nthe East India Company, a contract for the provision of opium, without\r\nadvertising for proposals, and without even receiving any written\r\nproposals from him, the said Sulivan; that he granted this contract for\r\nfour years, and at the request of the said Sulivan did omit that clause\r\nwhich was inserted in the preceding contract, and by which it was\r\nrendered liable to be determined by orders from the Company: the said\r\nWarren Hastings declaring, contrary to truth, that such clause was now\r\nunnecessary, as the Directors _had approved_ the contract.\r\n\r\nThat the said Sulivan had been but a few months in Bengal when the above\r\ncontract was given to him; that he was a stranger to the country, and to\r\nall the local commerce thereof, and therefore unqualified for the\r\nmanagement of such a concern; and that the said Sulivan, instead of\r\nexecuting the contract himself, did, shortly after obtaining the same,\r\nassign it over to John Benn and others, and in consideration of such\r\nassignment did receive from the said Benn a great sum of money.\r\n\r\nThat from the preceding facts, as well as from sundry other\r\ncircumstances of restrictions taken off (particularly by abolishing the\r\noffice of inspector into the quality of the opium) and of beneficial\r\nclauses introduced, it appears that the said Warren Hastings gave this\r\ncontract to the said Stephen Sulivan in contradiction to the orders of\r\nthe Court of Directors, and without any regard to the interests of the\r\nIndia Company, for the sole purpose of creating an instant fortune for\r\nthe said Sulivan at the expense of the India Company, without any claim\r\nof service or pretence of merit on his part, and without any apparent\r\nmotive whatever, except that of securing or rewarding the attachment and\r\nsupport of his father, Lawrence Sulivan, a person of great authority and\r\ninfluence in the direction of the Company's affairs, and notoriously\r\nattached to and connected with the said Warren Hastings.\r\n\r\nThat the said Stephen Sulivan neither possessed nor pretended to possess\r\nany skill in the business of his contract; that he exerted no industry,\r\nnor showed or could show any exactness, in the performance of it, since\r\nhe immediately sold the contract for a sum of money to another person,\r\n(for the sole purpose of which sale it must be presumed the same was\r\ngiven,) by which person another profit was to be made; and by that\r\nperson the same was again sold to a third, by whom a third profit was to\r\nbe made.\r\n\r\nThat the said Warren Hastings, at the very time when he engaged the\r\nCompany in a contract for engrossing the whole of the opium produced in\r\nBengal and Bahar in the ensuing four years on terms of such exorbitant\r\nprofit to the contractor, affirmed, that \"there was little prospect of\r\nselling the opium in Bengal at a reasonable price, and that it was but\r\nnatural to suppose that the price of opium _would fall, from the demand\r\nbeing lessened_\"; that in a letter dated the 5th of May, 1781, he\r\ninformed the Directors, \"that, owing to the indifferent state of the\r\nmarkets last season to the Eastward, and the very enhanced rates of\r\ninsurance which the war had occasioned, they had not been able to\r\ndispose of the opium of the present year to so great an advantage as\r\nthey expected, and that more than one half of it remained still in their\r\nwarehouses.\" That the said Warren Hastings was guilty of a manifest\r\nbreach of trust to his constituents and his employers in monopolizing,\r\nfor their pretended use, an article of commerce for which he declared\r\n_no purchasers had offered, and that there was little prospect of any\r\noffering, and the price of which_, he said, _it was but natural to\r\nsuppose would fall_.\r\n\r\nThat the said Warren Hastings, having, by his own act, loaded the\r\nCompany with a commodity for which, either in the ordinary and regular\r\ncourse of public auction, or even by private contract, there was, as he\r\naffirmed, no sale, did, under pretence of finding a market for the same,\r\nengage the Company in an enterprise of great and certain expense,\r\nsubject to a manifest risk, and full of disgrace to the East India\r\nCompany, not only in their political character, as a great sovereign\r\npower in India, but in their commercial character, as an eminent and\r\nrespectable body of merchants; and that the execution of this enterprise\r\nwas accompanied with sundry other engagements with other persons, in all\r\nof which the Company's interest was constantly sacrificed to that of\r\nindividuals favored by the said Warren Hastings.\r\n\r\nThat the said Warren Hastings first engaged in a scheme to export one\r\nthousand four hundred and sixty chests of opium, on the Company's\r\naccount, on board a ship belonging to Cudbert Thornhill, half of which\r\nwas to be disposed of in a coasting voyage, and the remainder in Canton.\r\nThat, besides the freight and commission payable to the said Thornhill\r\non this adventure, twelve pieces of cannon belonging to the Company were\r\nlent for arming the ship; though his original proposal was, that the\r\nship should be armed at his expense. That this part of the adventure,\r\ndepending for its success on a prudent and fortunate management of\r\nvarious sales and resales in the course of a circuitous voyage, and\r\nbeing exposed to such risk both of sea and enemy that all private\r\ntraders had declined to be concerned in it, was particularly unfit for a\r\ngreat trading company, and could not be undertaken on their account with\r\nany rational prospect of advantage.\r\n\r\nThat the said Warren Hastings soon after engaged in another scheme for\r\nexporting two thousand chests of opium directly to China on the\r\nCompany's account, and for that purpose accepted of an offer made by\r\nHenry Watson, the Company's chief engineer, to convey the same in a\r\nvessel of his own, and to deliver it to the Company's supra-cargoes.\r\nThat, after the offer of the said Henry Watson had been accepted, a\r\nletter from him was produced at the board, in which he declared that he\r\nwas unable to equip the ship with a proper number of cannon, and\r\nrequested that he might be furnished with thirty-six guns from the\r\nCompany's stores at Madras; with which request the board complied.\r\n\r\nThat it appears that George Williamson, the Company's auctioneer at\r\nCalcutta, having complained that by this mode of exporting the opium,\r\nwhich used to be sold by public auction, he lost his commission as\r\nauctioneer, the board allowed him to draw a commission of one per cent\r\non all the opium which had been or was to be exported. That it appears\r\nthat the contractor for opium (whose proper duties and emoluments as\r\ncontractor ended with the delivery of the opium) was also allowed to\r\ndraw a commission on the opium then shipping on the Company's account;\r\nbut for what reason, or on what pretence, does not appear.\r\n\r\nThat the said Warren Hastings, in order to pay the said Stephen Sulivan\r\nin advance for the opium furnished or to be furnished by him in the\r\nfirst year of his contract, did borrow the sum of twenty lacs of rupees\r\nat eight per cent, or two hundred thousand pounds sterling, to be repaid\r\nby drafts to be drawn on the Company by their supra-cargoes in China,\r\nprovided the opium consigned to them should arrive safe; but that, if\r\nthe adventure failed, whether by the loss of the ships or otherwise, the\r\nsubscribers to the above loan were to be repaid their capital and\r\ninterest out of the Company's treasury in Bengal.\r\n\r\nThat the said Warren Hastings, having in this manner purchased a\r\ncommodity for which he said there was no sale, and paid for it with\r\nmoney which he was obliged to borrow at a high interest, was still more\r\ncriminal in his attempt, or pretended plan, to introduce it\r\nclandestinely into China. That the importation of opium into China is\r\nforbidden by the Chinese government; that the opium, on seizure, is\r\nburnt, the vessel that imports it confiscated, and the Chinese in whose\r\npossession it may be found for sale punished with death.\r\n\r\nThat the Governor-General and Council were well aware of the existence\r\nof these prohibitions and penalties, and did therefore inform the\r\nsupra-cargoes in China, that the ship belonging to the said Henry Watson\r\nwould enter the river at China as an armed ship, _and would not be\r\nreported as bearing a cargo of opium, that being a contraband trade_.\r\n\r\nThat, of the above two ships, the first, belonging to Cudbert Thornhill,\r\nwas taken by the French; and that the second, arriving in China, did\r\noccasion much embarrassment and distress to the Company's supra-cargoes\r\nthere, who had not been previously consulted on the formation of the\r\nplan, and were exposed to great difficulty and hazard in the execution\r\nof their part of it. That the ship was delayed, at a demurrage of an\r\nhundred dollars a day, for upwards of three months, waiting in vain for\r\na better market. The factory estimate the _loss_ to the Company,\r\nincluding port charges, demurrage, and factory charges allowed the\r\ncaptain, at sixty-nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-three dollars,\r\nor about twenty thousand pounds sterling.\r\n\r\nThat the Company's factory at China, after stating the foregoing facts\r\nto the Court of Directors, conclude with the following general\r\nobservation thereon. \"On a review of these circumstances, with the\r\nextravagant and unusual terms of the freight, demurrage, factory\r\ncharges, &c., &c., we cannot help being of opinion that private\r\nconsiderations have been suffered to interfere too much for any benefit\r\nthat may have been intended to the Honorable Company. We hope for the\r\nHonorable Court's approbation of our conduct in this affair. The novelty\r\nand nature of the consignments have been the source of much trouble and\r\nanxiety, and, though we wished to have had it in our power to do more,\r\nwe may truly say we have exceeded our expectations.\"\r\n\r\nThat every part of this transaction, from the monopoly with which it\r\ncommenced, to the contraband dealing with which it concluded, criminates\r\nthe said Warren Hastings with wilful disobedience of orders and a\r\ncontinued breach of trust; that every step taken in it was attended with\r\nheavy loss to the Company, and with a sacrifice of their interest to\r\nthat of individuals; and that, if finally a profit had resulted to the\r\nCompany from such a transaction, no profit attending it could compensate\r\nfor the probable risk to which their trade in China was thereby exposed,\r\nor for the certain dishonor and consequent distrust which the East India\r\nCompany must incur in the eyes of the Chinese government by being\r\nengaged in a low, clandestine traffic, prohibited by the laws of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII.--APPOINTMENT OF R.J. SULIVAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat in the month of February, 1781, Mr. Richard Joseph Sulivan,\r\nSecretary to the Select Committee at Fort St. George, applied to them\r\nfor leave to proceed to Calcutta _on his private affairs_. That, being\r\nthe confidential secretary to the Select Committee at Fort St. George,\r\nand consequently possessed of all the views and secrets of the Company,\r\nas far as they related to that government, he went privately into the\r\nservice of the Nabob of Arcot, and, under the pretence of proceeding to\r\nCalcutta on his private business, undertook a commission from the said\r\nNabob to the Governor-General and Council, to negotiate with them in\r\nfavor of certain projects of the said Nabob which had been reprobated by\r\nthe Company.\r\n\r\nThat the said Sulivan was soon after appointed back again by the said\r\nWarren Hastings to the office of Resident at the Durbar of the said\r\nNabob of Arcot. That it was a high crime and misdemeanor in the said\r\nHastings to encourage so dangerous an example in the Company's service,\r\nand to interfere unnecessarily with the government of Madras in the\r\ndischarge of the duties peculiarly ascribed to them by the practice and\r\norders of the Company, for the purpose of appointing to a great and\r\nconfidential situation a man who had so recently committed a breach of\r\ntrust to his employers.\r\n\r\nThat the Court of Directors, in their letter to Bengal, dated the 12th\r\nof July, 1782, and received there on the 18th of February, 1783, did\r\n_condemn and revoke_ the said appointment. That the said Directors, in\r\ntheirs to Fort St. George, dated the 28th of August, 1782, and received\r\nthere the 31st of January, 1783, did highly condemn the conduct of the\r\nsaid Sulivan, and, in order to deter their servants from practices of\r\nthe same kind, _did dismiss him from their service_.\r\n\r\nThat the said Hastings, knowing that the said Sulivan's appointment had\r\nbeen condemned and revoked by the Court of Directors, and pretending\r\nthat on the 15th of March, 1783, he did not know that the said Sulivan\r\nwas _dismissed_ from the Company's service, though that fact was known\r\nat Madras on the 31st of the preceding January, did recommend the said\r\nSulivan to be ambassador at the court of Nizam Ali Khân, Subahdar of the\r\nDeccan, in defiance of the authority and orders of the Court of\r\nDirectors.\r\n\r\nThat, even admitting, what is highly improbable, that the _dismission_\r\nof the said Sulivan from the service of the said Company was not known\r\nat Calcutta in forty-three days from Madras, the last-mentioned\r\nnomination of the said Sulivan was made at least in contempt of the\r\ncensure already expressed by the Court of Directors at his former\r\nappointment to the Durbar of the Nabob of Arcot, and which was certainly\r\nknown to the said Hastings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV.--RANNA OF GOHUD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat on the 2d of December, 1779, the Governor-General and Council of\r\nFort William, at the special recommendation and instance of Warren\r\nHastings, Esquire, then Governor-General, and contrary to the declared\r\nopinion and protest of three of the members of the Council, viz., Philip\r\nFrancis and Edward Wheler, Esquires, who were present, and of Sir Eyre\r\nCoote, who was absent, (by whose absence the casting voice of the said\r\nWarren Hastings, Esquire, prevailed,) did conclude a treaty of perpetual\r\nfriendship and alliance, offensive and defensive, with a Hindoo prince,\r\ncalled the Ranna of Gohud, for the express purpose of using the forces\r\nof the said Ranna in opposition to the Mahrattas.\r\n\r\nThat, among other articles, it was stipulated with the said Ranna by the\r\nsaid Warren Hastings, \"that, whenever peace should be concluded between\r\nthe Company and the Mahratta state, the Maha Rajah should be included as\r\na party in the treaty which should be made for that purpose, and his\r\npresent possessions, together with the fort of Gualior, which of old\r\nbelonged to the family of the Maha Rajah, if it should be then in his\r\npossession, and such countries as he should have acquired in the course\r\nof war, and which it should then be stipulated to leave in his hands,\r\nshould be guarantied to him by such treaty.\"\r\n\r\nThat, in the late war against the Mahrattas, the said Ranna of Gohud did\r\nactually join the British army under the command of Colonel Muir with\r\ntwo battalions of infantry and twelve hundred cavalry, and did then\r\nserve in person against the Mahrattas, thereby affording material\r\nassistance, and rendering essential service to the Company.\r\n\r\nThat, in conformity to the above-mentioned treaty, in the fourth article\r\nof the treaty of peace concluded on the 13th of October, 1781, between\r\nColonel Muir, on the part of the English Company, and Mahdajee Sindia,\r\nthe Mahratta general, the said Ranna of Gohud was expressly included.\r\n\r\nThat, notwithstanding the said express provision and agreement, Mahdajee\r\nSindia proceeded to attack the forts and lay waste the territories of\r\nthe said Ranna, and did undertake and prosecute a war against him for\r\nthe space of two years, in the course of which the Ranna and his family\r\nwere reduced to extreme distress, and in the end he was deprived of his\r\nforts, and the whole not only of his acquired possessions, but of his\r\noriginal dominions, so specially guarantied to him by the British\r\ngovernment in both the above-mentioned treaties.\r\n\r\nThat the said Warren Hastings was duly and regularly informed of the\r\nprogress of the war against the Ranna, and of every event thereof;\r\nnotwithstanding which, he not only neglected in any manner to interfere\r\ntherein in favor of the said Ranna, or to use any endeavors to prevent\r\nthe infraction of the treaty, but gave considerable countenance and\r\nencouragement to Mahdajee Sindia in his violation of it, both by the\r\nresidence of the British minister in the Mahratta camp, and by the\r\napprobation shown by the said Warren Hastings to the promises made by\r\nhis agent of observing the strictest neutrality, notwithstanding he was\r\nin justice bound, and stood pledged by the most solemn and sacred\r\nengagements, to protect and preserve the said Ranna from those enemies,\r\nwhose resentment he had provoked only by his adherence to the interests\r\nof the British nation.\r\n\r\nThat, in the only attempt made to sound the disposition of Mahdajee\r\nSindia relative to a pacification between him and the Ranna of Gohud, on\r\nthe 14th of May, 1783, Mr. Anderson, in obedience to the orders he had\r\nreceived, did clearly and explicitly declare to Bhow Bucksey, the\r\nminister of Mahdajee Sindia, the sentiments of the said Warren Hastings\r\nin the words following: \"That it was so far from your [the said\r\nHastings's] meaning to intercede in his [the said Ranna's] favor, that I\r\nonly desired him to sound Sindia's sentiments, and, in case he was\r\ndesirous of peace, to mention what I had said; but if he seemed to\r\nprefer carrying on the war, I begged that he would not mention a\r\nsyllable of what had passed, but let the matter drop entirely.\"\r\n\r\nThat it afterwards appeared, in a minute of the said Hastings in Council\r\nat Fort William, on the 22d of September, 1783, that he promised, at the\r\ninstance of a member of the Council, to write to Lieutenant James\r\nAnderson in favor of the Ranna of Gohud, and lay his letter before the\r\nboard.\r\n\r\nThat, nevertheless, the said Hastings, professing _not to recollect_ his\r\nsaid promise, _did neglect to write a formal letter to Lieutenant\r\nAnderson in favor of the said Ranna of Gohud_, and that the private\r\nletter, the extract of which the said Hastings did lay before the board\r\non the 21st of October, 1783, so far from directing any effectual\r\ninterference in favor of the said Ranna, or commanding his agent, the\r\nsaid James Anderson, to interpose the mediation of the British\r\ngovernment to procure \"_honorable terms_\" for the said Ranna, or even\r\n\"_safety to his person and family_,\" contains the bitterest invectives\r\nagainst him, and is expressive of the satisfaction which the said\r\nHastings acknowledges himself to have enjoyed in the distresses of the\r\nsaid Ranna, the ally of the Company.\r\n\r\nThat the measures therein recommended appear rather to have been\r\ndesigned to satisfy Mahdajee Sindia, and to justify the conduct of the\r\nBritish government in not having taken a more active and a more hostile\r\npart against the said Ranna, than an intercession on his behalf.\r\n\r\nThat, though no consideration of good faith or observance of treaties\r\ncould induce the said Hastings to incur the hazard of any hostile\r\nexertion of the British force for the defence or the relief of the\r\nallies of the Company, yet in the said private letter he directed,\r\nthat, in case his mediation should be accepted, it should be made _a\r\nspecific condition_, that, _if the said Ranna should take advantage of\r\nSindia's absence to renew his hostilities, we ought, in that case, on\r\nrequisition, to invade the dominions of the Ranna_.\r\n\r\nThat no beneficial effects could have been procured to the said Ranna by\r\nan offer of mediation delayed till Sindia no longer wanted \"_our\r\nassistance to crush so fallen an enemy_,\" at the same time that no\r\nreason was given to Sindia to apprehend the danger of drawing upon\r\nhimself the resentment of the British government by a disregard of their\r\nproposal and the destruction of their ally.\r\n\r\nThat it was a gross and scandalous mockery in the said Hastings to defer\r\nan application to obtain honorable terms for the Ranna, and safety for\r\nhis person and family, till he had been deprived of his principal fort,\r\nin defence of which his uncle lost his life, and on the capture of\r\nwhich, his wife, to avoid the dishonor consequent upon falling into the\r\nhands of her enemies, _had destroyed herself by an explosion of\r\ngunpowder_.\r\n\r\nThat, however, it does not appear that any offer of mediation was ever\r\nactually made, or any influence exerted, either for the safety of the\r\nRanna's person and family or in mitigation of the _rigorous intentions_\r\nsupposed by Lieutenant Anderson[4] to have been entertained against him\r\nby Mahdajee Sindia after his surrender.\r\n\r\nThat the said Hastings, in the instructions[5] given by him to Mr. David\r\nAnderson for his conduct in negotiating the treaty of peace with the\r\nMahrattas, expressed his determination to desert the Ranna of Gohud in\r\nthe following words. \"You will of course be attentive to any engagements\r\nsubsisting between us and other powers, in settling the terms of peace\r\nand alliance with the Mahrattas. I except from this the Ranna of\r\nGohud.... Leave him to settle his own affairs with the Mahrattas.\"\r\n\r\nThat the said Anderson appears very assiduously to have sought for\r\ngrounds to justify the execution of this part of his instructions, to\r\nwhich, however, he was at all events obliged to conform.\r\n\r\nThat, even after his application for that purpose to the Mahrattas,\r\nwhose testimony was much to be suspected, because it was their interest\r\nto accuse and their determined object to destroy the said Ranna, no\r\nsatisfactory proof was obtained of his defection from the engagements he\r\nhad entered into with the Company.\r\n\r\nThat, moreover, if all the charges which have been pretended against the\r\nRanna, and have been alleged by the said Hastings in justification of\r\nhis conduct, had been well founded and proved to be true, the\r\nsubject-matter of those accusations and the proofs by which they wore to\r\nbe supported were known to Colonel Muir before the conclusion of the\r\ntreaty he entered into with Mahdajee Sindia; and therefore, whatever\r\nsuspicions may have been entertained or whatever degree of criminality\r\nmay have been proved against the said Ranna previous to the said treaty,\r\nfrom the time he was so provided for and included in the said treaty he\r\nwas fully and justly entitled to the security stipulated for him by the\r\nCompany, and had a right to demand and receive the protection of the\r\nBritish government.\r\n\r\nThat these considerations were urged by Mr. Anderson to the said Warren\r\nHastings, in his letter of the 24th of June, 1781, and were enforced by\r\nthis additional argument,--\"that, in point of policy, I believe, it\r\nought not to be our wish that the Mahrattas should ever recover the\r\nfortress of Gualior. It forms an important barrier to our own\r\npossessions. In the hands of the Ranna it can be of no prejudice to us;\r\nand notwithstanding the present prospect of a permanent peace betwixt us\r\nand the Mahrattas, it seems highly expedient that there should always\r\nremain some strong barrier to separate us, on this side of India, from\r\nthat warlike and powerful nation.\"\r\n\r\nThat the said Warren Hastings was highly culpable in abandoning the said\r\nRanna to the fury of his enemies, thereby forfeiting the honor and\r\ninjuring the credit of the British nation in India, notwithstanding the\r\nsaid Hastings was fully convinced, and had professed, \"that the most\r\nsacred observance of treaties, justice, and good faith were necessary to\r\nthe existence of the national interests in that country,\" and though the\r\nsaid Hastings has complained of the insufficiency of the laws of this\r\nkingdom to enforce this doctrine \"by the punishment of persons in the\r\npossession of power, who may be impelled by the provocation of ambition,\r\navarice, or vengeance, stronger than the restrictions of integrity and\r\nhonor, to the violation of this just and wise maxim.\"\r\n\r\nThat the said Hastings, in thus departing from these his own principles,\r\nwith a full and just sense of the guilt he would thereby incur, and in\r\nsacrificing the allies of this country \"_to the provocations of\r\nambition, avarice, or vengeance_,\" in violation of the national faith\r\nand justice, did commit a gross and wilful breach of his duty, and was\r\nthereby guilty of an high crime and misdemeanor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV.--REVENUES.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I.\r\n\r\nThat the property of the lands of Bengal is, according to the laws and\r\ncustoms of that country, an inheritable property, and that it is, with\r\nfew exceptions; vested in certain natives, called _zemindars_, or\r\nlandholders, under whom other natives, called _talookdars_ and _ryots_,\r\nhold certain subordinate rights of property or occupancy in the said\r\nlands. That the said natives are Hindoos, and that their _rights and\r\nprivileges are grounded upon the possession of regular grants, a long\r\nseries of family succession, and fair purchase_. That it appears that\r\nBengal has been under the dominion of the Mogul, and subject to a\r\nMahomedan government, for above two hundred years. That, while the Mogul\r\ngovernment was in its vigor, the property of zemindars was _held\r\nsacred_, and that, either by voluntary grant from the said Mogul or by\r\ncomposition with him, the native Hindoos were left in the free, quiet,\r\nand undisturbed possession of their lands, on the single condition of\r\npaying a fixed, certain, and unalterable revenue, or quit-rent, to the\r\nMogul government. That this revenue, or quit-rent, was called the\r\n_aussil jumma_, or _original ground-rent_, of the provinces, and was not\r\nincreased from the time when it was first settled in 1573 to 1740, when\r\nthe regular and effective Mogul government ended. That, from that time\r\nto 1765, invasions, usurpations, and various revolutions took place in\r\nthe government of Bengal, in consequence of which the country was\r\nconsiderably reduced and impoverished, when the East India Company\r\nreceived from the present Mogul emperor, Shah Allum, a grant of the\r\n_dewanny_, or collection of the revenues. That about the year 1770 the\r\nprovinces of Bengal and Bahar were visited with a dreadful famine and\r\nmortality, by which at least one third of the inhabitants perished. That\r\nWarren Hastings, Esquire, has declared, \"that he had always heard the\r\nloss of inhabitants reckoned at a third, and in many places near one\r\nhalf of the whole, and that he knew not by what means such a loss could\r\nbe recruited in four or five years, and believed it impossible.\" That,\r\nnevertheless, the revenue was _violently kept up to its former\r\nstandard_,--that is, in the two years immediately preceding the\r\nappointment of the said Warren Hastings to the government of Fort\r\nWilliam,--in consequence of which _the remaining two thirds of the\r\ninhabitants were obliged to pay for the lands now left without\r\ncultivation_; and that from the year 1770 to the year 1775 _the country\r\nhad languished, and the evil continued enhancing every day_. That the\r\nsaid Warren Hastings, in a letter to the Secret Committee of the Court\r\nof Directors, dated 1st September, 1772, declared, \"that the lands had\r\nsuffered unheard-of depopulation by the famine and mortality of 1769;\r\nthat the collections, _violently kept up to their former standard_, had\r\nadded to the distress of the country, and threatened a general decay of\r\nthe revenue, unless immediate remedies were applied to prevent it.\" That\r\nthe said Warren Hastings has declared, \"that, by intrusting the\r\ncollections to the hereditary zemindars, the people would be treated\r\nwith _more tenderness_, the rents more improved, and cultivation more\r\nlikely to be encouraged; that _they_ have a perpetual interest in the\r\ncountry; that _their_ inheritance cannot be removed; that _they_ are the\r\nproprietors; that the lands are _their_ estates, and _their_\r\ninheritance; that, from a long continuance of the lands in their\r\nfamilies, it is to be concluded they have riveted an authority in the\r\ndistrict, acquired an ascendency over the minds of the ryots, and\r\n_ingratiated their affections_; that, from continuing the lands under\r\nthe management of those who have a natural and perpetual interest in\r\ntheir prosperity, solid advantages might be expected to accrue; that the\r\nzemindar would be less liable to failure or deficiencies than the\r\nfarmer, from the perpetual interest which the former hath in the\r\ncountry, and because his inheritance cannot be removed, and it would be\r\nimprobable that he should risk the loss of it by eloping from his\r\ndistrict, which is too frequently practised by a farmer when he is\r\nhard-pressed for the payment of his balances, and as frequently\r\npredetermined when he receives his farm.\" That, notwithstanding all the\r\npreceding declarations made by the said Warren Hastings of the loss of\r\none third of the inhabitants and general decline of the country, he did,\r\nimmediately after his appointment to the government, in the year 1772,\r\nmake an arbitrary settlement of the revenues for five years at a higher\r\nrate than had ever been received before, and with a progressive and\r\naccumulating increase on each of the four last years of the said\r\nsettlement.\r\n\r\nThat, notwithstanding the right of property and inheritance, repeatedly\r\nacknowledged by the said Warren Hastings to be in the zemindars and\r\nother native landholders, and notwithstanding he had declared \"that the\r\nsecurity of private property is the greatest encouragement to industry,\r\non which the wealth of every state depends,\" the said Warren Hastings,\r\nnevertheless, in direct violation of those acknowledged rights and\r\nprinciples, did universally let the lands of Bengal _in farm_ for five\r\nyears,--thereby destroying all the rights of private property of the\r\nzemindars,--thereby delivering the management of their estates to\r\nfarmers, and transferring by a most arbitrary and unjust act of power\r\nthe whole landed property of Bengal from the owners to strangers. That,\r\nto accomplish this iniquitous purpose, he, the said Warren Hastings, did\r\nput the lands of Bengal up to a pretended public auction, _and invited\r\nall persons to make proposals for farming the same_, thereby encouraging\r\nstrangers to bid against the proprietors,--in consequence of which, not\r\nonly the said proprietors were ousted of the possession and management\r\nof their estates, but a great part of the lands fell into the hands of\r\nthe banians, or principal black servants of British subjects connected\r\nwith and protected by the government; and that the said Warren Hastings\r\nhimself has since declared, that _by this way the lands too generally\r\nfell into the hands of desperate or knavish adventurers_.[6] That,\r\nbefore the measure hereinbefore described was carried into execution,\r\nthe said Warren Hastings did establish certain fundamental regulations\r\nin Council, to be observed in executing the same.[7] That among these\r\nregulations it was specially and strictly ordered, that no farm should\r\nexceed the annual amount of _one_ lac of rupees, and \"that no peshcar,\r\nbanian, or other servant, of whatever denomination, of the collector, or\r\nrelation or dependant of any such servant, should be allowed to farm\r\nlands, nor directly or indirectly to hold a concern in any farm, nor to\r\nbe security for any farmer.\" That, in direct violation of these his own\r\nregulations, and in breach of the public trust reposed in him, and\r\nsufficiently declared by the manifest duty of his station, if it had not\r\nbeen expressed and enforced by any positive institution, he, the said\r\nWarren Hastings, did permit and suffer his own banian or principal black\r\nsteward, named Cantoo Baboo, to hold farms in different purgunnahs, or\r\ndistricts, or to be security for farms, to the amount of thirteen lac of\r\nrupees (130,000_l._ or upwards) per annum; and that, after enjoying the\r\nwhole of those farms for two years, he was permitted by the said Warren\r\nHastings to relinquish two of them. That on the subject of the farms\r\nheld by Cantoo Baboo the said Warren Hastings has made the following\r\ndeclaration. \"Many of his farms were taken without my knowledge, and\r\nalmost all against my advice. I had no right to use compulsion or\r\nauthority; nor could I with justice exclude him, because he was my\r\nservant, from a liberty allowed to all other persons in the country. The\r\nfarms which he quitted he quitted by my advice, because I thought that\r\nhe might engage himself beyond his abilities, and be involved in\r\ndisputes, which I did not choose to have come before me as judge of\r\nthem.\"[8] That the said declaration contains sundry false and\r\ncontradictory assertions: that, if _almost all_ the said farms were\r\ntaken against his advice, it cannot be true that _many_ of them were\r\ntaken without his knowledge; that, whether Cantoo Baboo had been his\r\nservant or not, the said Warren Hastings was bound by his own\r\nregulations to prevent his holding any farms to a greater amount than\r\none lac of rupees per annum, and that the said Cantoo Baboo, being the\r\nservant of the Governor-General, was excluded by the said regulations\r\nfrom holding any farms whatever; that, if (as the Directors observe) it\r\nwas thought dangerous to permit the banian of a collector to be\r\nconcerned in farms, the same or stronger objections would always lie\r\nagainst the Governor's banian being so concerned; that the said Warren\r\nHastings had a right, and was bound by his duty, to prevent his servant\r\nfrom holding the same; that, in advising the said Cantoo Baboo to\r\nrelinquish some of the said farms, for which he was actually engaged, he\r\nhas acknowledged an influence over his servant, and has used that\r\ninfluence for a purpose inconsistent with his duty to the India Company,\r\nnamely, to deprive them of the security of the said Cantoo Baboo's\r\nengagement for farms which on trial he had found not beneficial, or not\r\nlikely to continue beneficial, to himself; and that, if it was improper\r\nthat he, the said Warren Hastings, should be the judge of any disputes\r\nin which his servant might be involved on account of his farms, that\r\nreason ought to have obliged him to prevent his servant from being\r\nengaged in any farms whatever, or to have advised his said servant to\r\nrelinquish the remainder of his farms, as well as those which the said\r\nWarren Hastings affirms he quitted by his advice. That on the subject of\r\nthe said charge the Court of Directors of the East India Company have\r\ncome to the following resolution: \"_Resolved_, That it appears that the\r\nconduct of the late President and Council of Fort William in Bengal, in\r\nsuffering Cantoo Baboo, the present Governor-General's banian, to hold\r\nfarms in different purgunnahs to a large amount, or to be security for\r\nsuch farms, contrary to the tenor and spirit of the 17th regulation of\r\nthe Committee of Revenue at Fort William, of the 14th May, 1772, and\r\nafterwards relinquishing that security without satisfaction made to the\r\nCompany, was highly improper, and has been attended with considerable\r\nloss to the Company\"; and that in the whole of this transaction the said\r\nWarren Hastings has been guilty of gross collusion with his servant, and\r\nmanifest breach of trust to his employers.\r\n\r\nThat, whereas it was acknowledged by the said Warren Hastings, that the\r\ncountry, in the years 1770 and 1771, had suffered great depopulation and\r\ndecay, and that the collections of those years, having been violently\r\nkept up to their former standard, had added to the distress of the\r\ncountry, the settlement of the revenues made by him for five years,\r\ncommencing the 1st May, 1772, instead of offering any abatement or\r\nrelief to the inhabitants who had survived the famine, held out to the\r\nEast India Company a promise of great _increase_ of revenue, to be\r\nexacted from the country by the means hereinbefore described. That this\r\nsettlement was not realized, but fell considerably short, even in the\r\nfirst of the five years, when the demand was the lightest; and that on\r\nthe whole of the five years the real collections fell short of the\r\nsettlement to the enormous amount of two millions and a half sterling,\r\nand upwards. That such a settlement, if it had been or could have been\r\nrigorously exacted from a country already so distressed, and from a\r\npopulation so impaired, that, in the belief of the said Warren Hastings,\r\nit was impossible such loss could be recruited in four or five years,\r\nwould have been in fact, what it appeared to be in form, an act of the\r\nmost cruel and tyrannical oppression; but that the real use made of that\r\nunjust demand upon the natives of Bengal was, to oblige them to\r\ncompound privately with the persons who formed the settlement, and who\r\nthreatened to enforce it. That the enormous balances and remissions on\r\nthat settlement arose from a general collusion between the farmers and\r\ncollectors, and from a general peculation and embezzlement of the\r\nrevenues, by which the East India Company was grossly imposed on, in the\r\nfirst instance, by a promised _increase_ of revenue, and defrauded, in\r\nthe second, not only by the failure of that _increase_, but by the\r\nrevenues falling short of what they were in the two years preceding the\r\nsaid settlement to a great amount. That the said Warren Hastings, being\r\nthen at the head of the government of Bengal, was a party to all the\r\nsaid imposition, fraud, peculation, and embezzlement, and is principally\r\nand specially answerable for the same; and that, whereas sundry proofs\r\nof the said peculation and embezzlement were brought before the Court of\r\nDirectors, the said Directors (in a letter dated the 4th of March, 1778,\r\nand signed by William Devaynes and Nathaniel Smith, Esquires, now\r\nChairman and Deputy-Chairman of the said Court, and members of this\r\nHouse) did declare, that, \"although it was rather their wish to prevent\r\nfuture evils than to enter into a severe retrospection of past abuses,\r\nyet, as in some of the cases then before them they conceived there had\r\nbeen _flagrant corruption_, and in others great oppressions committed on\r\nthe native inhabitants, they thought it unjust to suffer the delinquents\r\nto pass wholly unpunished, and therefore they directed the\r\nGovernor-General and Council forthwith to commence a prosecution against\r\nthe persons who composed the Committee of Circuit, and their\r\nrepresentatives, and against all other proper parties\"; but that the\r\nprosecutions so ordered by the Court of Directors in the year 1778 have\r\nnever been brought to trial; and that the said Warren Hastings did, on\r\nthe 23d of December, 1783, propose and carry it in Council, _that orders\r\nshould be given for withdrawing_ the said prosecutions,--declaring, that\r\nhe was clearly of opinion that there was no ground to maintain them, and\r\n_that they would only be productive of expense to the Company and\r\nunmerited vexation to the parties_.\r\n\r\n\r\nREVENUES.\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\nThat the said Warren Hastings has on sundry occasions declared his\r\ndeliberate opinion generally against all innovations, and particularly\r\nin the collection and management of the revenues of Bengal: that \"he was\r\nwell aware of the expense and inconvenience _which ever attends\r\ninnovations of all kinds_, on, their first institution;[9]--that\r\ninnovations are _always_ attended with difficulties and inconveniences,\r\nand innovations in the revenue with a suspension of the\r\ncollections;[10]--that the continual variations in the mode of\r\ncollecting the revenue, and the continual usurpation on the rights of\r\nthe people, have fixed in the minds of the ryots a rooted distrust of\r\nthe ordinances of government.\"[11] That the Court of Directors have\r\nrepeatedly declared their apprehensions \"that a sudden transition from\r\none mode to another, in the investigation and collection of their\r\nrevenue, might have alarmed the inhabitants, lessened their confidence\r\nin the Company's proceedings, and been attended with other evils.\"[12]\r\n\r\nThat the said Warren Hastings, immediately after his appointment to the\r\ngovernment of Fort William, in April, 1772, did abolish the office of\r\n_Naib Dewan_, or native collector of the revenues, then existing; that\r\nhe did at the same time appoint a committee of the board to go on a\r\ncircuit through the provinces, and to form a settlement of the revenues\r\nfor five years; that he did then appoint sundry of the Company's\r\nservants to have the management of the collections, viz., one in each\r\ndistrict, under the title of _Collector_; that he did then abolish the\r\nGeneral Board of Revenue or Council at Moorshedabad, for the following\r\nreasons: \"That, while the controlling and executive part of the revenue\r\nand the correspondence with the collectors was carried on by a council\r\nat Moorshedabad, the members of the administration at Calcutta had no\r\nopportunity of acquiring that thorough and comprehensive knowledge which\r\ncould only result from _practical experience_; that the orders of the\r\nCourt of Directors, which established a new system, which enjoined many\r\nnew regulations and inquiries, could not properly be delegated to a\r\nsubordinate council, and it became absolutely necessary that the\r\nbusiness of the revenue should be conducted _under the immediate\r\nobservation and direction of the board_.\"[13]--That in November, 1773,\r\nthe said Warren Hastings abolished the office of Collector, and\r\ntransferred the collection and management of the revenues to several\r\ncouncils of revenue, commonly called _Provincial Councils_. That on the\r\n24th of October, 1774, the said Warren Hastings _earnestly offered his\r\nadvice_ (to the Governor-General and Council, then newly appointed by\r\nact of Parliament) _for the continuation of the said system of\r\nProvincial Councils in all its parts_. That the said Warren Hastings\r\ndid, on the 22d of April, 1775, transmit to the Directors a formal plan\r\nfor the future settlement of the revenues, and did therein declare,\r\nthat, \"with respect to the mode of managing the collection of the\r\nrevenue and the administration of justice, none occurred to him so good\r\nas the system which was already established of Provincial Councils.\"\r\nThat on the 18th of January, 1776, the said Warren Hastings did transmit\r\nto the Court of Directors a plan for the better administration of\r\njustice, that in this plan the establishment of the said Provincial\r\nCouncils was specially provided for and confirmed, and that Warren\r\nHastings did recommend it to the Directors _to obtain the sanction of\r\nParliament for a confirmation of the said plan_. That on the 30th of\r\nApril, 1776, the said Warren Hastings did transmit to the Court of\r\nDirectors the draft or scheme of an act of Parliament for the better\r\nadministration of justice in the provinces, in which the said\r\nestablishment of Provincial Councils is again specially included, and\r\nspecial jurisdiction assigned to the said Councils. That the Court of\r\nDirectors, in a letter dated 5th of February, 1777, did give the\r\nfollowing instruction to the Governor-General and Council, a majority of\r\nwhom, viz., Sir John Clavering, Colonel Monson, and Mr. Francis, had\r\ndisapproved of the plan of Provincial Councils: \"If you are fully\r\nconvinced that the establishment of Provincial Councils has not answered\r\nnor is not capable of answering the purposes intended by such\r\ninstitutions, we hereby direct you to form a new plan for the collection\r\nof the revenues, and to transmit the same to _us for our\r\nconsideration_.\"--That the said Warren Hastings, in contradiction to his\r\nown sentiments repeatedly declared, and to his own advice repeatedly\r\nand deliberately given, and in defiance of the orders of the Directors,\r\nto whom he transmitted no previous communication whatever of his\r\nintention to abolish the said Provincial Councils, did, in the beginning\r\nof the year 1781, again change the whole system of the collections of\r\nthe public revenue of Bengal, as also the administration of civil and\r\ncriminal justice throughout the provinces. That the said Warren\r\nHastings, in a letter dated 5th of May, 1781, advising the Court of\r\nDirectors of the said changes, has falsely affirmed, \"that the plan of\r\nsuperintending and collecting the public revenue of the provinces\r\nthrough the agency of Provincial Councils had been instituted for the\r\ntemporary and declared purpose of introducing another more permanent\r\nmode _by an easy and gradual change_\"; that, on the contrary, the said\r\nWarren Hastings, from the year 1773 to the year 1781, has constantly and\r\nuniformly insisted on the wisdom of that institution, and on the\r\nnecessity of never departing from it; that he has in that time\r\nrepeatedly advised that the said institution should be confirmed _in\r\nperpetuity_ by an act of Parliament; that the said total dissolution of\r\nthe Provincial Councils was not introduced by any easy and gradual\r\nchange, nor by any gradations whatever, but was sudden and unprepared,\r\nand instantly accomplished by a single act of power; and that the said\r\nWarren Hastings, in the place of the said Councils, has substituted a\r\nCommittee of Revenue, consisting of four covenanted servants, on\r\nprinciples opposite to those which he had himself professed, and with\r\nexclusive powers, tending to deprive the members of the Supreme Council\r\nof a due knowledge of and inspection into the management of the\r\nterritorial revenues, specially and unalienably vested by the\r\nlegislature in the Governor-General and Council, and to vest the same\r\nsolely and entirely in the said Warren Hastings. That the reasons\r\nassigned by the said Warren Hastings for constituting the said Committee\r\nof Revenue are incompatible with those which he professed when he\r\nabolished the subordinate Council of Revenue at Moorshedabad: that he\r\nhas invested the said Committee _in the fullest manner with all the\r\npowers and authority of the Governor-General and Council_; that he has\r\nthereby contracted the whole power and office of the Provincial Councils\r\ninto a small compass, and vested the same in four persons appointed by\r\nhimself; that he has thereby taken the general transaction and\r\ncognizance of revenue business out of the Supreme Council; that the said\r\nCommittee are empowered to conduct the current business of the revenue\r\ndepartment without reference to the Supreme Council, and only _report to\r\nthe board such extraordinary occurrences, claims, and proposals as may\r\nrequire the special orders of the board_; that even the instruction to\r\nreport to the board in extraordinary cases is nugatory and fallacious,\r\nbeing accompanied with limitations which make it impossible for the said\r\nboard to decide on any questions whatsoever: since it is expressly\r\nprovided by the said Warren Hastings, _that, if the members of the\r\nCommittee differ in opinion, it is not expected that every dissentient\r\nopinion should be recorded_; consequently the Supreme Council, on any\r\nreference to their board, can see nothing but the resolutions or reasons\r\nof the majority of the Committee, without the arguments on which the\r\ndissentient opinions might be founded: and since it is also expressly\r\nprovided by the said Warren Hastings, that _the determination of the\r\nmajority of the Committee should not therefore be stayed, unless it\r\nshould be so agreed by the majority_,--that is, that, notwithstanding\r\nthe reference to the Supreme Council, the measure shall be executed\r\nwithout waiting for their decision.\r\n\r\nThat the said Warren Hastings has delivered his opinion, with many\r\narguments to support the same, in favor of long leases of the lands, in\r\npreference to _annual_ settlements: that he has particularly declared,\r\n\"that the farmer who holds his farm for one year only, having no\r\ninterest in the next, takes what he can with the hand of rigor, which,\r\neven in the execution of legal claims, is often equivalent to violence;\r\nhe is under the necessity of being rigid, and _even cruel_,--for what is\r\nleft in arrear after the expiration of his power is at best a doubtful\r\ndebt, if ever recoverable; he will be tempted to exceed the bounds of\r\nright, and to augment his income by irregular exactions, and by racking\r\nthe tenants, for which pretences will not be wanting, where the farms\r\npass _annually_ from one hand to another; that the discouragements which\r\nthe tenants feel from being transferred every year to new landlords are\r\na great objection to such short leases; that they contribute to injure\r\nthe cultivation and dispeople the lands; that, on the contrary, from\r\nlong farms the farmer acquires a permanent interest in his lands; he\r\nwill, for his own sake, lay out money in assisting his tenants in\r\nimproving lands already cultivated, and in clearing and cultivating\r\nwaste lands.\"[14] That, nevertheless, the said Warren Hastings, having\r\nleft it to the discretion of the Committee of Revenue, appointed by him\r\nin 1781, to fix the time for which the ensuing settlement should be\r\nmade, and the said Committee having declared, that, _with respect to the\r\nperiod of the lease, in general, it appeared to the Committee that to\r\nlimit them to one year would be the best period_, he, the said Warren\r\nHastings, approved of that limitation, in manifest contradiction to all\r\nhis own arguments, professions, and declarations concerning the fatal\r\nconsequences of _annual_ leases of the lands; that in so doing the said\r\nWarren Hastings did not hold himself bound or restrained by the orders\r\nof the Court of Directors, but acted upon his own discretion; and that\r\nhe has, for partial and interested purposes, exercised that discretion\r\nin particular instances against his own general settlement for one year,\r\nby granting perpetual leases of farms and zemindaries to persons\r\nspecially favored by him, and particularly by granting a perpetual lease\r\nof the zemindary of Baharbund to his servant Cantoo Baboo on very low\r\nterms.\r\n\r\nThat in all the preceding transactions the said Warren Hastings did act\r\ncontrary to his duty as Governor of Fort William, contrary to the orders\r\nof his employers, and contrary to his own declared sense of expediency,\r\nconsistency, and justice, and thereby did harass and afflict the\r\ninhabitants of the provinces with perpetual changes in the system and\r\nexecution of the government placed over them, and with continued\r\ninnovations and exactions, against the rights of the said\r\ninhabitants,--thereby destroying all security to private property, and\r\nall confidence in the good faith, principles, and justice of the British\r\ngovernment. And that the said Warren Hastings, having substituted his\r\nown instruments to be the managers and collectors of the public revenue,\r\nin the manner hereinbefore mentioned, did act in manifest breach and\r\ndefiance of an act of the 13th of his present Majesty, by which _the\r\nordering and management and government of all the territorial revenues\r\nin the kingdoms of Bengal, Bahar, and Orissa_ were vested in the\r\nGovernor-General and Council, without any power of delegating the said\r\ntrust and duty to any other persons; and that, by such unlawful\r\ndelegation of the powers of the Council to a subordinate board appointed\r\nby himself, he, the said Warren Hastings, did in effect unite and vest\r\nin his own person the ordering, government, and management of all the\r\nsaid territorial revenues; and that for the said illegal act he, the\r\nsaid Warren Hastings, is solely answerable, the same having been\r\nproposed and resolved in Council when the Governor-General and Council\r\nconsisted but of two persons present,--namely, the said Warren Hastings,\r\nand the late Edward Wheler, Esquire, and when consequently the\r\nGovernor-General, by virtue of the casting voice, possessed the whole\r\npower of the government. That, in all the changes and innovations\r\nhereinbefore described, the pretence used by the said Warren Hastings to\r\nrecommend and justify the same to the Court of Directors has been, that\r\nsuch changes and innovations would be attended with increase of revenue\r\nor diminution of expense to the East India Company; that such pretence,\r\nif true, would not have been a justification of such acts; but that such\r\npretence is false and groundless: that during the administration of the\r\nsaid Warren Hastings the territorial revenues have declined; that the\r\ncharges of collecting the same have greatly increased; and that the said\r\nWarren Hastings, by his neglect, mismanagement, and by a direct and\r\nintended waste of the Company's property, is chargeable with and\r\nanswerable for all the said decline of revenue, and all the said\r\nincrease of expense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI.--MISDEMEANORS IN OUDE.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. That the province of Oude and its dependencies were, before their\r\nconnection with and subordination to the Company, in a flourishing\r\ncondition with regard to culture, commerce, and population, and their\r\nrulers and principal nobility maintained themselves in a state of\r\naffluence and splendor; but very shortly after the period aforesaid, the\r\nprosperity both of the country and its chiefs began sensibly and rapidly\r\nto decline, insomuch that the revenue of the said province, which, on\r\nthe lowest estimation, had been found, in the commencement of the\r\nBritish influence, at upwards of three millions sterling annually, (and\r\nthat ample revenue raised without detriment to the country,) did not in\r\nthe year 1779 exceed the sum of 1,500,000_l._, and in the subsequent\r\nyears did fall much short of that sum, although the rents were generally\r\nadvanced, and the country grievously oppressed in order to raise it.\r\n\r\nII. That in the aforesaid year, 1779, the demands of the East India\r\nCompany on the Nabob of Oude are stated by Mr. Purling, their Resident\r\nat the court of Oude, to amount to the sum of 1,360,000_l._ sterling and\r\nupwards, leaving (upon the supposition that the whole revenue should\r\namount to the sum of 1,500,000_l._ sterling, to which it did not amount)\r\nno more than 140,000_l._ sterling for the support of the dignity of the\r\nhousehold and family of the Nabob, and for the maintenance of his\r\ngovernment, as well as for the payment of the public debts due within\r\nthe province.\r\n\r\nIII. That by the treaty of Fyzabad a regular brigade of the Company's\r\ntroops, to be stationed in the dominions of the Nabob of Oude, was kept\r\nup at the expense of the said Nabob; in addition to which a temporary\r\nbrigade of the same troops was added to his establishment, together with\r\nseveral detached corps in the Company's service, and a great part of his\r\nown native Troops were put under the command of British officers.\r\n\r\nIV. That the expense of the Company's temporary brigade increased in the\r\nsame year (the year of 1779) upwards of 80,000_l._ sterling above the\r\nestimate, and the expense of the country troops under British officers\r\nin the same period increased upwards of 40,000_l._ sterling; and in\r\naddition to the aforesaid ruinous expenses, a large civil establishment\r\nwas gradually, secretly, and without any authority from the Court of\r\nDirectors, or record in the books of the Council-General concerning the\r\nsame, formed for the Resident, and another under Mr. Wombwell, an agent\r\nfor the Company; as also several pensions and allowances, in the same\r\nsecret and clandestine manner, were charged on the revenues of the said\r\nNabob for the benefit of British subjects, besides large occasional\r\ngifts to persons in the Company's service.\r\n\r\nV. That in the month of November, 1779, the said Nabob did represent to\r\nMr. Purling, the Company's Resident aforesaid, the distressed state of\r\nhis revenues in the following terms. \"During three years past, the\r\nexpense occasioned by the troops in brigade, and others commanded by\r\nEuropean officers, has much distressed the support of my household,\r\ninsomuch that the allowances made to the seraglio and children of the\r\ndeceased Nabob have been reduced to _one fourth_ of what it had been,\r\nupon which they have subsisted in a very distressed manner for two years\r\npast. The attendants, writers, and servants, &c., of my court, have\r\nreceived no pay for two years past; and there is at present no part of\r\nthe country that can be allotted to the payment of my father's private\r\ncreditors, whose applications are daily pressing upon me. All these\r\ndifficulties I have for these three years past struggled through, and\r\nfound this consolation therein, that it was complying with the pleasure\r\nof the Honorable Company, and in the hope that the Supreme Council would\r\nmake inquiry from impartial persons into my distressed situation; but I\r\nam now forced to a representation. From the _great increase of expense_,\r\nthe revenues were necessarily farmed out _at a high rate;_ and\r\ndeficiencies followed yearly. The country and cultivation is abandoned;\r\nand this year in particular, from the excessive drought, deductions of\r\nmany lacs\" (stated by the Resident, in his letter to the board of the\r\n13th of the month following, to amount to twenty-five lac, or\r\n250,000_l._ sterling) \"have been allowed the farmers, who were still\r\nleft unsatisfied. I have received but just sufficient to support my\r\nabsolute necessities, the revenues being deficient to the amount of\r\nfifteen lac [150,000_l._ sterling], and for this reason many of the old\r\nchieftains with their troops, and the useful attendants of the court,\r\nwere forced to leave it, and there is now only a few foot and horse for\r\nthe collection of my revenues; and should the zemindars be refractory,\r\nthere is not left a sufficient number to reduce them to obedience.\" And\r\nthe said Nabob did therefore pray that the assignments for the new\r\nbrigade, the corps of horse, and the other detached bodies of the\r\nCompany's troops might not be required from him: alleging, \"that the\r\nformer was not only quite useless to his government, but, moreover, the\r\ncause of much loss, both in the revenues and customs; and that the\r\ndetached bodies of troops under their European officers brought nothing\r\nbut confusion into the affairs of his government, and were entirely\r\ntheir own masters.\"\r\n\r\nVI. That it appears that the said Nabob was not bound by any treaty to\r\nthe maintenance, without his consent, _even of the old brigade_,--the\r\nCourt of Directors having, in their letter of the 15th December, 1775,\r\napproved of keeping the same in his service, \"_provided it was done with\r\nthe free consent of the Subah, and by no means without it_.\" And the\r\n_new brigade_ and temporary corps were raised on the express condition,\r\nthat the expense thereof should be charged on the Nabob only \"_for so\r\nlong a time as he should require the corps for his service_.\" And the\r\nCourt of Directors express to the Governor-General and Council their\r\nsense of the said agreement in the following terms: \"But if you intend\r\nto exert your influence first to induce the Vizier to acquiesce in your\r\nproposal, and afterwards _to compel him to keep the troops in his pay\r\nduring your pleasure, your intents are unjust; and a correspondent\r\nconduct would reflect great dishonor on the Company_.\"\r\n\r\nVII. That, in answer to the decent and humble representation aforesaid\r\nof the Nabob of Oude, the allegations of which, so far as they relate to\r\nthe distressed state of the Nabob's finances, and his total inability to\r\ndischarge the demands made on him, were confirmed by the testimony of\r\nthe English Resident at Oude, and which the said Hastings did not deny\r\nin the whole or in any part thereof, he, the said Warren Hastings, did,\r\non pretence of certain political dangers, declare the relief desired to\r\nbe \"without hesitation _totally_ inadmissible,\" and did falsely and\r\nmaliciously insinuate, \"that the _tone_ in which the demands of the\r\nNabob were asserted, and the season in which they were made, did give\r\ncause for _the most alarming suspicions_.\" And the said Warren Hastings\r\ndid, in a letter to the Nabob aforesaid, written in haughty and insolent\r\nlanguage, and without taking any notice of the distresses of the said\r\nNabob, alleged and verified as before recited, \"require and insist upon\r\nyour [the Nabob's] granting _tuncaws_ [assignments] for the full amount\r\nof their [the Company's] demands upon you for the current year, and on\r\nyour reserving funds sufficient to answer them, _even should the\r\ndeficiencies of your revenues compel you to leave your own troops\r\nunprovided for, or to disband a part of them to enable you to effect\r\nit_.\"\r\n\r\nVIII. That, in a letter written at the same time to the Resident,\r\nPurling, and intended for his directions in enforcing on the Nabob the\r\nunjust demands aforesaid, the said Warren Hastings hath asserted, in\r\ndirect contradiction to the treaties subsisting between the said Nabob\r\nand the Company, \"that he [the Nabob] stands engaged to our government\r\nto maintain the English armies which at his own request have been formed\r\nfor the protection of his dominions, and _that it is our part, and not\r\nhis, to judge and determine in what manner and at what time these shall\r\nbe reduced and withdrawn_.\" And in a Minute of Consultation, when the\r\naforesaid measure was proposed by the said Hastings to the Supreme\r\nCouncil, he did affirm and maintain that the troops aforesaid \"had now\r\nno _separate_ or distinct existence from ours, and may be properly said\r\nto consist of our _whole_ military establishment, with the exception\r\nonly of our European infantry; and that they could not be withdrawn\r\nwithout imposing on the Company _the additional burden of them_, or\r\ndisbanding nine battalions of disciplined sepoys and three regiments of\r\nhorse.\"\r\n\r\nIX. That in the Minute of Consultation aforesaid, he, the said Warren\r\nHastings, hath further, in justification of the violent and arbitrary\r\nproceedings aforesaid, asserted, \"that the arrangement of measures\r\nbetween the British government and their allies, the native powers of\r\nIndia, must, in case of disagreement about the necessity thereof, _be\r\ndecided by the strongest_\"; and hath thereby advanced a dangerous and\r\nmost indecently expressed position, subversive of the rights of allies,\r\nand tending to breed war and confusion, instead of cordiality and\r\ncoöperation amongst them, and to destroy all confidence of the princes\r\nof India in the faith and justice of the English nation. And the said\r\nHastings, having further, in the minute aforesaid, presumed to threaten\r\nto \"bring to punishment, if my influence\" (his, the said Hastings's,\r\ninfluence) \"can produce that effect, _those incendiaries_ who have\r\nendeavored to make themselves the instruments of division between us,\"\r\nhath, as far as in him lay, obstructed the performance of one of the\r\nmost essential duties of a prince engaged in an unequal alliance with a\r\npresiding state,--that of representing the grievances of his subjects to\r\nthat more powerful state by whose acts they suffer: leaving thereby the\r\ngoverning power in total ignorance of the effects of its own measures,\r\nand to the oppressed people no other choice than the alternative of an\r\nunqualified submission, or a resistance productive of consequences more\r\nfatal.\r\n\r\nX. That, all relief being denied to the Nabob, in the manner and on the\r\ngrounds aforesaid, the demands of the Company on the said Nabob in the\r\nyear following, that is to say, in the year 1780, did amount to the\r\nenormous sum of 1,400,000_l._ sterling, and the distress of the province\r\ndid rapidly increase.\r\n\r\nXI. That the Nabob, on the 24th of February of the same year, did again\r\nwrite to the Governor-General, the said Warren Hastings, a letter, in\r\nwhich he expressed his constant friendship to the Company, and his\r\nsubmission and obedience to their orders, and asserting that he had not\r\ntroubled them with any of his difficulties, trusting they would learn\r\nthem from other quarters, and that he should be relieved by their\r\nfriendship. \"But,\" he says, \"when _the knife had penetrated to the\r\nbone_, and I was surrounded with such heavy distresses that I could no\r\nlonger live in expectations, I then wrote an account of my difficulties.\r\nThe answer I have received to it is such that it has given me\r\ninexpressible grief and affliction. I never had the least idea or\r\nexpectation from you and the Council that you would have given your\r\norders in _so afflicting a manner, in which you never before wrote, and\r\nI could never have imagined_. I have delivered up all my _private_\r\npapers to him [the Resident], that, after examining my receipts and\r\nexpenses, he may take whatever remains. That, as I know it to be my\r\nduty to satisfy you [the Company and Council], I have not failed to obey\r\nin any instance; but requested of him that it might be done so as not to\r\ndistress me in my _necessary_ expenses. There being no other funds but\r\nthose for the expenses of my _mutseddies_ [clerks and accountants],\r\nhousehold expenses, and servants, &c., he demanded these in such a\r\nmanner, that, being remediless, I was obliged to comply with what he\r\nrequired. He has accordingly stopped _the pensions of my old servants\r\nfor thirty years, whether sepoys [soldiers], mutseddies [secretaries and\r\naccountants], or household servants, and the expenses of my family and\r\nkitchen, together with the jaghires of my grandmother, mother, and\r\naunts, and of my brothers and dependants, which were for their\r\nsupport_.\"\r\n\r\nXII. That, in answer to the letter aforesaid, the Resident received from\r\nthe said Warren Hastings and Council an order to persevere in the demand\r\nto its fullest extent,--that is to say, to the amount of 1,400,000_l._\r\nsterling.\r\n\r\nXIII. That on the 15th of May the Nabob replied, complaining in an\r\nhumble and suppliant manner of his distressed situation: that he had at\r\nfirst opposed the assigning to the use of the Company the estates of his\r\nmother, of his grandmother, of one of his uncles, and of the sons of\r\nanother, but that, in obedience to the injunctions of the gentlemen of\r\nthe Council, it had been done, to the amount, on the whole, of\r\n80,000_l._ sterling a year, or thereabouts; that whatever effects were\r\nin the country, with even his table, his animals, and the salaries of\r\nhis servants, were granted in assignments; that, besides these, if they\r\nwere resolved again to compel him to give up the estates of his parents\r\nand relations, which were granted them for their maintenance, they were\r\nat the Company's disposal; saying, \"If the Council have directed you to\r\nattach them, do it: in the country no further sources remain. I have no\r\nmeans; for I have not a subsistence.--How long shall I dwell upon my\r\nmisfortunes?\"\r\n\r\nXIV. That the truth of the said remonstrances was not disputed, nor the\r\n_tone_ in which they were written complained of, the same being\r\nsubmissive, and even abject, though the cause (his distresses) was by\r\nthe said Hastings, in a great degree, and in terms the most offensive,\r\nattributed to the Nabob himself; but no relief was given, and the same\r\nunwarrantable establishments, maintained at the same ruinous expense,\r\nwere kept up.\r\n\r\nXV. That the said Warren Hastings, having considered as incendiaries\r\nthose who advised the remonstrances aforesaid, and, to prevent the same\r\nin future, having denounced vengeance on those concerned therein, did,\r\nfor the purpose of keeping in his own power all representations of the\r\nstate of the court and country aforesaid, and to subject both the one\r\nand the other to his own arbitrary will, and to draw to himself and to\r\nhis creatures the management of the Nabob's revenues, in defiance of the\r\norders of the Court of Directors, a second time recall Mr. Bristow, the\r\nCompany's Resident, from the court of Oude,--having once before recalled\r\nhim, as the said Directors express themselves, \"without the shadow of a\r\ncharge being exhibited against him,\" and having, on the occasion and\r\ntime now stated, produced no specific charge against the said Resident;\r\nand he, the said Hastings, did appoint Nathaniel Middleton, Esquire, to\r\nsucceed him,--it being his declared principle, that he must have a\r\nperson of _his own_ confidence in that situation.\r\n\r\nXVI. That the said Warren Hastings, after he had refused all relief to\r\nthe distresses of the Nabob in the manner aforesaid, and had described\r\nthose who advised the representation of the grievances of Oude as\r\n_incendiaries_, did himself, in a minute of the 21st May, 1781, describe\r\nthat province \"as fallen into a state of great disorder and confusion,\r\nand its resources in an extraordinary degree diminished,\"--and did\r\nstate, that his presence in the said province was requested by the\r\nNabob, and that, unless some effectual measures were taken for his\r\nrelief, he [the Nabob] must be under the necessity of leaving his\r\ncountry, and coming down to Calcutta, to represent the situation of his\r\ngovernment. And Mr. Wheler did declare that the Governor-General's\r\nrepresentation of the state of that province \"was but too well founded,\r\nand was convinced that it would require his utmost abilities and powers,\r\napplied and exercised on the spot, to restore it to its former good\r\norder and affluence.\"\r\n\r\nXVII. That the said Warren Hastings, in consequence of the minute\r\naforesaid, did grant to himself, and did procure the consent of his only\r\ncolleague, Edward Wheler, Esquire, to a commission or delegation, with\r\npowers \"to assist the Nabob Vizier in forming such regulations as may\r\nbe necessary for the peace and good order of his government, the\r\nimprovement of his revenue, and the adjustment of the mutual concerns\r\nsubsisting between him and the Company.\" And in the said commission or\r\ndelegation he, the said Warren Hastings, did cause to be inserted\r\ncertain powers and provisions of a new and dangerous nature: that is to\r\nsay, reciting the business before mentioned, he did convey to himself\r\n\"such authority to enforce the same _as the Governor-General and Council\r\nmight or could exercise on occasions in which they could be warranted to\r\nexercise the same_, and to form and conclude such several engagements or\r\ntreaties with the Nabob Vizier, the government of Berar, and with any\r\nchiefs or powers of Hindostan, as _he_ should judge expedient and\r\nnecessary.\" Towards the conclusion of the act or instrument aforesaid\r\nare the words following, viz.: \"It is hereby declared, that all such\r\nacts, and all such engagements or treaties aforesaid, shall be binding\r\non the Governor-General and Council in the same manner, _and as\r\neffectually, as if they had been done and passed by the specific and\r\nimmediate concurrence and actual junction of the Governor-General and\r\nCouncil, in council assembled_.\" And the said powers were, by the said\r\nWarren Hastings, given by himself and the said Wheler, under the seal of\r\nthe Company, on the 3d July, 1781.\r\n\r\nXVIII. That the said commission, delegating to him, the said Warren\r\nHastings, the whole functions of the Council, is destructive to the\r\nconstitution thereof, and is contrary to the Company's standing orders,\r\nand is illegal.\r\n\r\nXIX. That, in virtue of those powers, and the illegal delegation\r\naforesaid, the said Warren Hastings, after he had finished his business\r\nat Benares, did procure a meeting with the Nabob of Oude at a place\r\ncalled Chunar, upon the confines of the country of Benares, and did\r\nthere enter into a treaty, or pretended treaty, with the said Nabob; one\r\npart of which the said Warren Hastings did pretend was drawn up from a\r\nseries of requisitions presented to him by the Nabob, but which\r\nrequisitions, or any copy thereof, or of any other material document\r\nrelative thereto, he did not at the time transmit to the\r\nPresidency,--the said Warren Hastings informing Mr. Wheler, that the\r\nResident, Middleton, had taken the _authentic_ papers relative to this\r\ntransaction with him to Lucknow: and it does not appear that the said\r\nWarren Hastings did ever reclaim the said papers, in order to record\r\nthem at the Presidency, to be transmitted to the Court of Directors, as\r\nit was his duty to do.\r\n\r\nXX. That the purport of certain articles of the said treaty, on the part\r\nof the Company, was, that, in consideration of the Nabob's _inability_\r\n(which inability the preamble of the treaty asserts to have been\r\n\"repeatedly and urgently represented\") to support the expenses of the\r\ntemporary brigade, and of three regiments of cavalry, and also of the\r\nBritish officers with their battalions, and of _other_ gentlemen who\r\nwere then paid by him, the several corps aforesaid, and the other\r\ngentlemen, (with the exception of the Resident's office _then on the\r\nNabob's list_, and a regiment of sepoys for the Resident's guard,)\r\nshould, after a term of two and a half months, be no longer at his, the\r\nNabob's, charge: \"the true meaning of this being, that no more troops\r\nthan one brigade, and the pay and allowances of a regiment of sepoys,\"\r\n(as aforesaid, to the Resident,) amounting in the whole to 342,000_l._ a\r\nyear, should be paid by the Nabob; and that _no officers, troops, or\r\nothers, should be put upon the Nabob's establishment_, exclusive of\r\nthose in the said treaty stipulated.\r\n\r\nXXI. That the said Warren Hastings did defend and justify the said\r\narticles, in which the troops aforesaid were to be removed from the\r\nNabob's establishment, by declaring as follows. \"That the _actual_\r\ndisbursements to those troops had fallen upon _our own funds_, and that\r\n_we_ support a body of troops, established _solely_ for the defence of\r\nthe Nabob's possessions, _at our own expense_. It is true, we charge the\r\nNabob with this expense; but the large balance already due from him\r\nshows too justly the little prospect there was of disengaging ourselves\r\nfrom _a burden_ which was daily adding to _our_ distresses and must soon\r\nbecome _insupportable_, although it were granted that the Nabob's debt,\r\nthen suffered to accumulate, _might at some future period be\r\nliquidated_, and that this measure would substantially effect an instant\r\nrelief to the pecuniary distresses of the Company.\"\r\n\r\nXXII. That Nathaniel Middleton, the Resident, did also declare that he\r\nwould at all times testify, \"that, upon the plan of the foregoing years,\r\nthe receipts from the Nabob were only _a deception_, and _not an\r\nadvantage_, but _an injury_ to the Company,\" and \"that a remission to\r\nthe Nabob of this _insufferable burden_ was _a profit_ to the Company.\"\r\nAnd the said Hastings did assert that the force of the Company was not\r\nlessened by withdrawing the temporary troops; although, when it suited\r\nthe purpose of the said Hastings, in denying just relief to the\r\ndistresses of the said Nabob of Oude, he had not scrupled to assert the\r\ndirect contrary of the positions by him maintained in justification of\r\nthe treaty of Chunar,--having in his minute aforesaid, of the 15th of\r\nDecember, 1779, asserted, \"that these troops\" (the troops maintained by\r\nthe Nabob of Oude) \"had no _separate or distinct existence_, and may be\r\nproperly said to consist of our whole military establishment, with the\r\nexception only of our European infantry, and that they could not be\r\n_withdrawn, without imposing on the Company the additional burden of\r\ntheir expense_, or disbanding nine battalions of disciplined sepoys and\r\nthree regiments of horse.\"\r\n\r\nXXIII. That he, the said Warren Hastings, in justification of his\r\nagreement to withdraw the troops aforesaid from the territories and pay\r\nof the Nabob of Oude, did further declare, \"that he had been too much\r\naccustomed to the tales of hostile preparation and impending invasions,\r\nagainst all the evidence of political probability, to regard them as any\r\nother than phantoms raised for the purpose of perpetuating or\r\nmultiplying commands,\" and he did trust \"all ideas of danger from the\r\nneighboring powers were altogether visionary; and that, even if they had\r\nbeen better founded, this mode of anticipating possible evils would be\r\nmore mischievous than anything they had reason to apprehend,\" and that\r\nthe internal state of the Nabob's dominions did not require the\r\ncontinuance of the said troops; and that the Nabob, \"_whose concern it\r\nwas, and not ours_\" did affirm the same,--notwithstanding he, the said\r\nHastings, had before, in answer to the humble supplications of the\r\nNabob, asserted, that \"_it was our part, and not his_, to judge and\r\ndetermine in what manner and at what time they should be reduced or\r\nwithdrawn.\"\r\n\r\nXXIV. That the said Warren Hastings, in support of his measure of\r\nwithdrawing the said brigade and other troops, did also represent, that\r\n\"the remote stations of those troops, placing the commanding officers\r\nbeyond the notice and control of the board, afforded too much\r\nopportunity and temptation for unwarrantable emoluments, and excited the\r\n_contagion of peculation and rapacity throughout the whole army_, and,\r\nas an instance thereof, that a court-martial, composed of officers of\r\nrank and respectable characters, unanimously and honorably, 'most\r\nhonorably,' acquitted an officer upon an acknowledged fact which in\r\ntimes of stricter discipline would have been deemed a crime deserving\r\nthe severest punishment.\"\r\n\r\nXXV. That the said Warren Hastings, having in the letter aforesaid\r\ncontradicted all the grounds and reasons by him assigned for keeping up\r\nthe aforesaid establishment, and having declared his own conviction that\r\nthe whole was a fallacy and imposition, and a detriment to the Company\r\ninstead of a benefit, circumstances (if they are true) which he might\r\nand ought to have well known, was guilty of an high crime and\r\nmisdemeanor in carrying on the imposture and delusion aforesaid, and in\r\ncontinuing an insupportable burden and grievance upon the Nabob for\r\nseveral years, without attending to his repeated supplications to be\r\nrelieved therefrom, to the utter ruin of his country, and to the\r\ndestruction of the discipline of the British troops, by diffusing among\r\nthem a general spirit of peculation; and the said Hastings hath\r\ncommitted a grievous offence in upholding the same pernicious system,\r\nuntil, by his own confession and declaration, in his minute of the 21st\r\nof May, 1781, \"the evils had _grown_ to so great an height, that\r\nexertions will be required more powerful than can be made through the\r\ndelegated authority of the servants of the Company now in the province,\r\nand that he was far from sanguine in his expectations that _even his own\r\nendeavors would be attended with much success_.\"\r\n\r\nXXVI. That, at the time of making the said treaty, and at the time when,\r\nunder color of the distress of the Nabob of Oude, and the failure of all\r\nother means for his relief, he, the said Hastings, broke the Company's\r\nfaith with the parents of the Nabob, and first encouraged and afterwards\r\ncompelled him to despoil them of their landed estates, money, jewels,\r\nand household goods, and while the said Nabob continued heavily in debt\r\nto the Company, he, the said Warren Hastings, did, \"_without\r\nhesitation_,\" accept of and receive from the Nabob of Oude and his\r\nministers (who are notoriously known to be not only under his influence,\r\nbut under his absolute command) a bribe, or unlawful gift or present, of\r\none hundred thousand pounds sterling, and upwards. That, even if the\r\nsaid pretended gift could be supposed to be voluntary, it was contrary\r\nto the express provision of the Regulating Act of the 13th year of his\r\nMajesty's reign, prohibiting the receipt of all presents upon any\r\npretence whatsoever, and contrary to his own sense of the true intent\r\nand meaning of the said act, declared upon a similar, but not so strong\r\na case,--that is, where the service done, and the present offered in\r\nreturn for it, had taken place before the promulgation of the above laws\r\nin India: on that occasion he declared, \"that the exclusion by an act of\r\nParliament _admitted of no abatement or evasion_, wherever its authority\r\nextended.\"\r\n\r\nXXVII. That the said Warren Hastings, confiding in an interest which he\r\nsupposed himself to have formed in the East India House, did endeavor to\r\nprevail on the Court of Directors to violate the said act, and to suffer\r\nhim to appropriate the money so illegally accepted by him to his own\r\nprofit, as a reward for his services.\r\n\r\nXXVIII. That the said Warren Hastings has since declared to the Court of\r\nDirectors, that, when _fortune threw a sum in his way_ (meaning the sum\r\nof money above mentioned) _of a magnitude which could not be concealed,\r\nhe chose to apprise his employers of it_:[15] thereby confessing, that,\r\nbut for the magnitude of the same rendering it difficult to be\r\nconcealed, he never would have discovered it to them. And the said\r\nunlawful present being received at the time when, for reasons directly\r\ncontradictory of all his former recorded declarations, he did agree to\r\nremove the aforesaid troops from the Nabob's dominions, and to recall\r\nthe pensioners aforesaid, it must be presumed that he did not agree to\r\ngive the relief (which he had before so obstinately refused) upon the\r\ngrounds and motives of justice, policy, or humanity, but in\r\nconsideration of the sum of money aforesaid, which, in a time of such\r\nextreme distress in the Nabob's affairs, could not be rationally given,\r\nexcept for those and other concessions stipulated for in the said\r\ntreaty, but which had on former occasions been refused.\r\n\r\nXXIX. That, notwithstanding his, the said Warren Hastings's, receipt of\r\nthe present of one hundred thousand pounds, as aforesaid, he did violate\r\nevery one of the stipulations in the said treaty contained, and\r\nparticularly he did continue in the country, and in the service of the\r\nNabob of Oude, those troops which he had so recently stipulated to\r\nwithdraw from his country and to take from his establishment: for, upon\r\nthe 24th of December following, he did order the temporary brigade,\r\nmaking ten battalions of five hundred men each, to be again put on the\r\nVizier's list,--although he had recently informed the Court of\r\nDirectors, through Edward Wheler, Esquire, that any benefit to be\r\nderived from the Nabob's paying that brigade was _a fallacy and a\r\ndeception_, and that the same was _a charge_ upon the Company, and not\r\n_an alleviation of its distresses_, as well as _an insupportable burden_\r\nto the Nabob: thus having, within a short space of time, twice\r\ncontradicted himself, both in declaration and in conduct.\r\n\r\nXXX. That this measure, in direct violation of a treaty of not three\r\nmonths' duration, was so injudicious, that, in the opinion of the\r\nAssistant Resident, Johnson, \"nothing less than blows could effect it\":\r\nhe, the said Resident, further adding, \"that the Nabob was not even able\r\nto pay off the arrears still due to it [the new brigade]; and that the\r\ntroops being _all_ in arrears, and no possibility of present payment,\r\nso large a body assembled here [viz., at Lucknow] without any means to\r\ncheck and control them, nothing but disorder could follow. As one proof\r\nthat the Nabob is as badly off for funds as we are, I may inform you\r\nthat his cavalry rose this day upon him, and went all armed to the\r\npalace, to demand from thirteen to eighteen months' arrears, and were\r\nwith great difficulty persuaded to retire, which was probably more\r\neffected by a body of troops getting under arms to go against them than\r\nany other consideration.\" But the letter of Warren Hastings, Esquire, of\r\nthe 24th of December, giving the above orders for the infraction of the\r\ntreaty, and to which the letter from whence the foregoing extracts are\r\ntaken is an answer, doth not appear, any otherwise than as the same is\r\nrecited in the said answer.\r\n\r\nXXXI. That, notwithstanding the disorders and deficiencies in the\r\nrevenue aforesaid had continued and increased, and that three very large\r\nbalances had accumulated, the said Warren Hastings did cause the\r\nTreasury accounts at Calcutta to be examined and scrutinized, and an\r\naccount of another arrear, composed of various articles, pretended to\r\nhave accumulated during seven years previous to the year 1779, (the\r\narticles composing which, if they had been just, ought to have been\r\ncharged at the times they severally became due,) was sent to the\r\nResident, and payment thereof demanded, to the amount of 260,000_l._\r\nsterling; which unexpected demand, in so distressed a situation, did not\r\na little embarrass the Nabob. But whilst he and his ministers were\r\nexamining into the said unexpected demand, another, and fifth balance,\r\nmade up of similar forgotten articles, was demanded, to the amount of\r\n140,000_l._ sterling more. Which said two last demands did so terrify\r\nand confound the Nabob and his ministers, that they declared that the\r\nResident \"might at once take the country, since justice was out of the\r\nquestion.\"\r\n\r\nXXXII. That the said Hastings, in order to add to the confusion,\r\nperplexity, and distress of the Nabob's affairs, did send to his court\r\n(in which he had already a Resident and Assistant Resident) two secret\r\nagents, Major Palmer and Major Davy, and did instruct Major Palmer to\r\nmake a variety of new claims, one of a loan to the Company of\r\n600,000_l._ sterling, although he well knew the Nabob was himself\r\nheavily in arrear to the Company, and was utterly unable to discharge\r\nthe same, as well as in arrear to his own troops, and to many\r\nindividuals, and that he borrowed (when he could at all borrow) at an\r\ninterest of near thirty per cent. To this demand was added a new bribe,\r\nor unlawful present, to himself, to the amount of 100,000_l._ sterling,\r\nwhich he did not refuse as unlawful and of evil example, but as\r\n_indelicate_ in the Nabob's present situation,--and did, as if the same\r\nwas his own property, presume to dispose of it, and to desire the\r\ntransfer of it, as of his own bounty, to the Company, his masters. To\r\nthis second demand he, the said Hastings, added a third demand of\r\n120,000_l._ sterling, for four additional regiments on the Nabob's list,\r\nafter he had solemnly engaged to take off the ten with which it had been\r\nburdened: the whole of the claims through his private agent aforesaid\r\nmaking the sum of 820,000_l._ sterling.\r\n\r\nXXXIII. That the demands, claims, &c., made by the said Warren Hastings\r\nupon the government of Oude in that year amounted to the enormous sum of\r\n2,530,000_l._ sterling; which joined to the arrears to troops, and some\r\ninternal failures, amounting to 255,000_l._ sterling more, the whole\r\ncharge arose to 2,785,000_l._ sterling, which was considerably more than\r\ndouble the net produce of the Nabob's revenue,--the same only amounting\r\nto 1,450,000_l._ \"nominal revenue, never completely realized.\"\r\n\r\nXXXIV. That, towards providing for these extravagant demands, he, the\r\nsaid Warren Hastings, did direct and authorize another breach of the\r\npublic faith given in the treaty of Chunar. For whereas, by the second\r\narticle of the treaty aforesaid, it was left to the Nabob's discretion\r\nwhether or not he should resume the landed estates, called jaghires,\r\nwithin his dominions, and notwithstanding the said Hastings, in defence\r\nof the said article, did declare that the Nabob should be left to the\r\nexercise of his own authority and pleasure respecting them, yet he, the\r\nsaid Hastings, did authorize a violent compulsion to be used towards the\r\nsaid Nabob for accomplishing an universal confiscation of that species\r\nof landed property; and in so doing he did also compel the Nabob to\r\nbreak his faith with all the landholders of that description, not only\r\nin violating the assurance of his own original grants, but his assurance\r\nrecently given, when, being pressed by the Company, he, the Nabob, had\r\nmade a temporary seizure of the profits of the lands aforesaid, in the\r\nmanner of a compulsory loan, for the repayment of which he gave his\r\nbonds and obligations; and although he had at the same time solemnly\r\npledged his faith that he never would again resort to the like\r\noppressive measure, yet he, the said Warren Hastings, did cause him to\r\nbe compelled to confiscate the estates of at least sixty-seven of the\r\nprincipal persons of his country, comprehending therein his own nearest\r\nrelations and the ancient friends and dependants of his family: the\r\nannual value of the said estates thus confiscated amounting to\r\n435,000_l._ sterling, or thereabouts, upon an old valuation, but stated\r\nby the Resident, Middleton, as being found to yield considerably more.\r\n\r\nXXXV. That the violent and unjust measure aforesaid, subversive of\r\nproperty, utterly destructive of several ancient and considerable\r\nfamilies, and most dishonorable to the British government, did produce\r\nan universal discontent and the greatest confusion throughout the whole\r\ncountry,--the said confiscated lands being on this occasion put to\r\nrack-rents, and the people grievously oppressed: and to prevent a\r\npossibility of redress, at least for a considerable time, the said\r\nconfiscated estates were mortgaged (it appearing otherwise impracticable\r\nto make an approach towards satisfying the exorbitant demands of the\r\nsaid Hastings) for a great sum to certain usurious bankers or\r\nmoney-dealers at Benares.\r\n\r\nXXXVI. That, besides these enormous demands, which were in part made for\r\nthe support of several corps of troops under British officers which by\r\nthe treaty of Chunar ought to have been removed, very large extra\r\ncharges not belonging to the military list of the said Nabob, and\r\nseveral civil charges and pensions, were continued, and others newly put\r\non since the treaty of Chunar, namely, an allowance to Sir Eyre Coote\r\nof 15,554 rupees per month, (being upwards of 18,664_l._ sterling a\r\nyear,) and an allowance to Trevor Wheler, Esquire, of 5,000 rupees per\r\nmonth (or 6,000_l._ sterling and upwards a year); and the whole of the\r\nsettled charges, not of a military nature, to British subjects, did\r\namount to little less than 140,000_l._ yearly, and, if other allowances\r\nnot included in the estimate were added, would greatly exceed that sum,\r\nbesides much more which may justly be suspected to have been paid, no\r\npart whereof had at that time been brought forward to any public\r\naccount.\r\n\r\nXXXVII. That the commander of one of these corps, of whose burden the\r\nsaid Nabob did complain, was Lieutenant-Colonel Alexander Hannay, who\r\ndid farm the revenues of certain districts called Baraitch and\r\nGoruckpore, which the said Hastings, in the ninth article of his\r\ninstructions to Mr. Bristow, did estimate at twenty-three lacs of\r\nrupees, or 230,000_l._, per annum: but under his, the said Hannay's,\r\nmanagement, the collections did very greatly decline; complaints were\r\nmade that the countries aforesaid were harassed and oppressed, and the\r\nsame did fall into confusion, and at last the inhabitants broke out into\r\na general rebellion.\r\n\r\nXXXVIII. That the far greater part of the said heavy list was authorized\r\nor ordered by him, the said Warren Hastings, for the purpose of\r\nextending his own corrupt influence: for it doth appear, that, at the\r\ntime when he did pretend, in conformity to the treaty of Chunar\r\naforesaid, to remove the Company's servants, \"_civil_ and military,\r\nfrom the court and service of the Vizier,\" he did assert that he thereby\r\ndid \"diminish _his own influence_, as well as that of his colleagues, by\r\nnarrowing the line of _patronage_\"; which proves that the offices,\r\npensions, and other emoluments aforesaid, in Oude, were of _his_\r\npatronage, as his patronage could not be diminished by taking away the\r\nsaid offices, &c., unless the same had been substantially of his gift.\r\nAnd he did, at the time of the pretended reformation aforesaid, express\r\nboth his knowledge of the existence of the said excessive and abusive\r\nestablishments, and his sense of his duty in taking them away: for in\r\nagreeing to the article in the treaty of Chunar for abolishing the said\r\nestablishments, he did declare himself \"actuated solely by motives of\r\n_justice_ to the Nabob, and a regard to _the honor of our national\r\ncharacter_\"; and, according to his own representation, the said servants\r\nof the Company, civil and military, \"by their numbers, their influence,\r\nand the _enormous amount_ of their salaries, pensions, and emoluments,\r\nwere an _intolerable_ burden on the revenues and authority of the\r\nVizier, and exposed us to _the envy and resentment of the whole\r\ncountry_, by excluding the native servants and adherents of the Vizier\r\nfrom the rewards of their services and attachment.\"\r\n\r\nXXXIX. That the revenue of the country being anticipated, mortgaged, and\r\ndilapidated, by the counsel, concurrence, connivance, and influence, and\r\noften by the direct order of the said Warren Hastings, the whole civil\r\ngovernment, magistracy, and administration of justice gradually declined\r\nand at length totally ceased through the whole of the vast provinces\r\nwhich compose the territory of Oude, and no power was visible therein\r\nbut that of the farmers of the revenue, attended by bodies of troops to\r\nenforce the collections; insomuch that robberies, assassinations, and\r\nacts of every description of outrage and violence were perpetrated with\r\nimpunity,--and even in the capital city of Lucknow, the seat of the\r\nsovereign power, there was no court of justice whatever to take\r\ncognizance of such offences.\r\n\r\nXL. That the said Warren Hastings, when he did interfere in the\r\ngovernment of Oude, was obliged by his duty to interfere for the good\r\npurposes of government, and not merely for the purpose of extorting\r\nmoney therefrom and enriching his own dependants,--which latter purpose\r\nalone he did effect, in the manner before mentioned, but not one of the\r\nformer. For the said Hastings, having procured the extraordinary powers\r\ngiven by and to himself by his delegation of the 3d of July, 1781, did\r\ndeclare the same to be for the purpose, among many others, \"of assisting\r\nthe Nabob Vizier in forming such regulations as may be necessary for the\r\npeace and good order of his government and the improvement of his\r\nrevenue.\" And in consequence of the said powers, the said Warren\r\nHastings did, in the treaty of Chunar, obtain an article from the Nabob\r\nby which the said Nabob did promise to attend to his advice in the\r\nreformation of his civil administration; and he did give certain\r\ninstructions to the Resident, Middleton, to which he did require him to\r\nyield _the most implicit obedience_, and did in one article thereof\r\ndirect him to urge the Nabob to endeavor gradually, if it could not be\r\ndone at once, to establish courts of _adawlut_ [justice], and that the\r\n_darogahs_ [chief criminal magistrates], _moulavies_ [consulting or\r\nassistant lawyers], and other officers, should be selected by the\r\nministers, with his, the Resident's, concurrence; and afterwards, in his\r\ninstructions to the Resident Bristow, desiring him to pursue the same\r\nobject, he declared his opinion, \"that the want of such courts, and the\r\nextreme licentiousness occasioned thereby, is one of the most\r\ndisreputable defects in his Highness the Nabob's government, and that,\r\nwhile they do not exist, every man knows the hazard which he incurs in\r\nlending his money \"; but he did give him, the said Resident, no positive\r\ninstruction concerning the same, supposing the establishment of such\r\ncourts a matter of difficulty, and did therefore leave him a latitude in\r\nhis proceedings therein.\r\n\r\nXLI. That the said Resident Bristow did, however, in conformity to the\r\nsaid instructions, at last given with such latitude, endeavor to prevail\r\non the said minister gradually to introduce courts of justice for the\r\ncognizance of crimes, by beginning to establish a criminal court under a\r\nnative judge, to judge according to the Mahomedan law in the city of\r\nLucknow. But Hyder Beg Khân, a minister of the said Warren Hastings's\r\nnomination, and solely dependent upon him, did elude and obstruct, and\r\nin the end totally defeat, the establishment of the same.\r\n\r\nXLII. That the obstruction aforesaid, and the evil consequences thereof,\r\nwere duly represented to the said Hastings; and though the said Hastings\r\nhad made it the fourth article of a criminal charge against the Resident\r\nMiddleton, \"that he did not report to the Governor-General, or to the\r\nboard, the progress which he had made from time to time in his endeavors\r\nto comply with his instructions, and that, if he met with any\r\nimpediments in the execution of them, he had omitted to state those\r\nimpediments, and to apply for fresh orders upon them,\" yet he, the said\r\nHastings, did give no manner of support to the Resident Bristow against\r\nthe said Hyder Beg Khân, and did not even answer several of his letters,\r\nthe said Bristow's letters, stating the said impediments, or take any\r\nnotice of his remonstrances, but did at length revoke his own\r\ninstructions, declaring that he, the said Resident, should not presume\r\nto act upon the same, and yet did not furnish him with any others, upon\r\nwhich he might act, but did uphold the said Hyder Beg Khân in the\r\nobstruction by him given to the performance of the first and fundamental\r\nduty of all government,--namely, the administration of justice, and the\r\nprotection of the lives and property of the subject against wrong and\r\nviolence.\r\n\r\nXLIII. That the said Hastings did afterwards proceed to the length of\r\ncriminating the Resident Bristow aforesaid for his endeavors to\r\nestablish the said necessary court, as an invasion of the rights of the\r\nNabob's government,--when, if the Nabob in his own proper person and\r\ncharacter, and not the aforesaid Hyder Beg, (who was a creature of the\r\nsaid Hastings,) had opposed the reëstablishment of justice in the said\r\ncountry, it was the duty of the said Hastings to have pressed the same\r\nupon him by every exertion of his influence. And the said Warren\r\nHastings, in his pretended attention to the Nabob's authority, when\r\nexercised by his, the said Hastings's, minister, to prevent the\r\nestablishment of courts of justice for the protection of life and\r\nproperty, at the same time that he did not hesitate, in the case of the\r\nconfiscation of the jaghires, and the proceedings against the mother and\r\ngrandmother of the Nabob, totally to supersede his authority, and to\r\nforce his inclinations in acts which overturned all the laws of\r\nproperty, and offered violence to all the sentiments of natural\r\naffection and duty, and accusing at the same time his instruments for\r\nnot going to the utmost lengths in the execution of his said orders, is\r\nguilty of an high crime and misdemeanor.\r\n\r\nXLIV. That the said Hastings did highly aggravate his offence in\r\ndiscountenancing and discouraging the reëstablishment of magistracy,\r\nlaw, and order, in the country of Oude, inasmuch as he did in the eighth\r\narticle of his instructions to the Resident order him to exercise powers\r\nwhich ought to have been exercised by lawful magistrates, and in a\r\nmanner agreeable to law. And in the said article he did state the\r\nprevalence of rebellion in the said country of Oude,--as if rebellion\r\ncould exist in a country in which there was no magistracy, and no\r\nprotection for life or property, and in which the native authority had\r\nno force whatever, and in which he himself states the exercise of\r\nBritish authority to be an absolute usurpation; and he did accordingly\r\ndirect a rigorous prosecution against the offence of rebellion under\r\nsuch circumstances, but \"with a fair and impartial inquiry,\" when he did\r\nnot permit the establishment of those courts of justice and magistracy\r\nby which alone rebellion could be prevented, or a fair and impartial\r\ninquiry relative to the same could be had; and particularly he did\r\ninstruct the said Resident to obtain the Nabob's order for employing\r\nsome sure means for apprehending certain zemindars, and particularly\r\nthree, in the instruction named, whom he, the said Hastings, did cause\r\nto be apprehended upon what he calls good information, founded upon some\r\nfacts to which he asserts he has the testimony of several witnesses,\r\n\"that they had the destruction of Colonel Hannay and the officers under\r\nhis command as their immediate object, and ultimately the extirpation of\r\nthe English influence and power throughout all the Nabob's dominions,\"\r\nand that they did still persevere in their rebellious conduct without\r\ndeviation, \"though the Nabob's, and not our government, was then the\r\nobject of it\"; and he did direct the said Resident, if it should appear,\r\n\"_on a fair and regular inquiry_, that their conduct towards the Nabob\r\nhad been such as it had been reported to be, to insist upon the Nabob's\r\npunishing them with _death_, and to treat with the same rigor every\r\nzemindar and every subject who shall be the leader in a rebellion\r\nagainst his authority.\"\r\n\r\nXLV. That the crime of the said Hastings, in his procedure aforesaid,\r\nwas further highly aggravated by his having received information of\r\nseveral striking circumstances which strongly indicated the necessity of\r\na regular magistracy and a legal judicature, from the total failure of\r\njustice, affecting not only the subjects at large, but even the reigning\r\nfamily itself,--as also of the causes why no legal magistracy could\r\nexist, and why the princes of the reigning family were not only exposed\r\nto the attacks of assassins, but even to a want of the protection which\r\nmight be had from their servants and attendants, who were driven from\r\ntheir masters for want of that maintenance which the princes, their\r\nmasters, could not procure even for themselves. And the circumstances\r\naforesaid were detailed to him, the said Hastings, by the Resident,\r\nBristow, in a letter from Lucknow, dated the 29th January, 1784, to the\r\nGovernor-General, the said Warren Hastings, and the Council of Bengal,\r\nin the terms following.\r\n\r\n\"The frequent robberies and murders perpetrated in his Excellency's, the\r\nVizier's, dominions, have been _too often_ the subject of my\r\nrepresentations to your honorable board. From the total want of police,\r\nhardly a day elapses but I am informed of some tragical event, whereof\r\nthe bare recital is shocking to humanity. About two months since, an\r\nattempt was made to assassinate Rajah Ticket Roy, the acting minister's\r\nconfidential agent; but he happily escaped unhurt. Nabob Bahadur, _his\r\nHighness's brother_, has not been so fortunate, as will appear from\r\ntranslations of two of his letters to me, No. 1, which I have the honor\r\nto inclose for your information. Although my feelings are sensibly hurt\r\nand my compassion strongly excited by _the disgraceful and miserable\r\nstate of poverty to which his Excellency's brothers are reduced_, yet,\r\nsituated as I am, it is not in my power to interfere with effect. My\r\nefforts on a former occasion failed of success, _and my interposition\r\nnow would only excite the resentment of the minister towards the unhappy\r\nsufferers, in consequence of their application to me, from whom ALONE,\r\nhowever, they hope for relief from their present distress_, which, their\r\nnear connection with the Vizier considered, is both shameful and\r\nunprecedented. That no regular courts of justice have been established\r\nin this country is particularly pointed at in my instructions, as the\r\nmost disreputable defect in his Highness's government; yet the minister\r\nseems determined on abolishing even the shadow of so necessary an\r\ninstitution. The office of Chief Justice, as held by Moulavy Morobine,\r\nwas ever nugatory, but now it is sunk into the lowest contempt. The\r\noriginal establishment, inadequate as it was, is mouldering away, and\r\nthe officers now attached to it are literally starving, as no part of\r\ntheir allowance has been paid for above six months past. He himself has\r\nproposed to resign his appointment, being every way precluded from a\r\npossibility of exercising the duties of it.\"\r\n\r\nXLVI. That it appears by the said letter, and the papers therewith\r\ntransmitted, as well as other documents in the said correspondence,\r\nthat, in consequence of the distress brought upon the Nabob's finances,\r\ncertain of the princes, his brethren, the children of Sujah ul Dowlah,\r\nthe late sovereign of the country, were put upon pensions unsuitable to\r\ntheir birth and rank, and by the mismanagement of the minister\r\naforesaid, (appointed by the said Warren Hastings,) for two years\r\ntogether no considerable part of the said inadequate pension was paid;\r\nand not being able to maintain the attendants necessary for their\r\nprotection in a city in which all magistracy and justice was abolished,\r\nthey were not only liable to suffer the greatest extremities of penury,\r\nbut their lives were exposed to the attempts of assassins: the condition\r\nof one of the said princes, called the Nabob Bahadur, being by himself\r\nstrongly expressed in three letters to the said Resident Bristow,--the\r\nfirst dated the 28th of December, 1783; the second, the 7th of January,\r\n1784; and the third, the 15th of January, 1784,--which letters were\r\nduly transmitted, in the dispatch of the 29th of the same month, to\r\nWarren Hastings, Esquire, and are as follow.\r\n\r\n\"Your own servant carried you the account of what he himself was an\r\neye-witness to, after the affair of last night. These are the\r\nparticulars. About midnight my aunt received twelve wounds from a\r\nruffian, of which she died. I also received six successive stabs, which\r\nalarmed the people of the house, who set up a shouting: whereupon the\r\nassassin run off. Besides being _without food or the means of providing\r\nany_, this misfortune has befallen me. _I am desirous of sending the\r\ncoffin to your door_. It is your duty, both for the sake of God and of\r\nChrist, to execute justice, and to inquire what harm I have done to the\r\nmurderer sufficient to deserve assassination, or even injury. _You now\r\nstand in the place of his Excellency the Vizier_. I request you will do\r\nme justice. What more can I say?\r\n\r\n\"P.S. I am also desirous to show you my wounds.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_From the same, 29th [7th?] January, 1784._\r\n\r\n\"You have been duly informed of all the circumstances relative both to\r\nthe murder of the innocent, and of my being wounded, as well by my\r\nformer letter, as by the messenger whom you sent to inquire into the\r\nstate of my health; and I have every reason to hope, from your known\r\nkindness, that you will not be deficient in seeking out the assassin. _I\r\nam at this moment overwhelmed in misfortune. Whilst the blood is flowing\r\nfrom my wounds, neither I nor my children nor my servants have\r\nwherewithal to procure subsistence_; nor have I it in my power either to\r\npurchase remedies or to reward the physician: _it is for the sake of\r\nGod alone that he attends me_. Thus loaded with calamity upon calamity,\r\nI am unable to support life; for I find no relief from any affliction\r\neither day or night. Do you now stand in the place of my father; grant\r\nme fresh life by speedy acts of benevolence.\r\n\r\n\"For these two last years his Excellency established a pension for me of\r\ntwenty thousand rupees; but I never received the full amount of it,\r\neither last year or the year before. Should it, however, be paid me,\r\nthough inadequate to my desires, I shall still be enabled to support\r\nmyself. From the beginning of this year to the present time I have not\r\nreceived a farthing, nor do I expect any; though, if you afford\r\nprotection to the oppressed, all my wishes will be accomplished. I was\r\ndesirous of waiting on you with my family, that you might be an\r\neye-witness to their condition; but I was advised not to stir out on\r\naccount of my wounds. What more can I say?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The following Extracts are made from the Third Letter from the same\r\nPrince, dated January 15, 1784._\r\n\r\n\"The particulars of the late and unforeseen misfortune with which I have\r\nbeen overwhelmed are not unknown unto you,--that the innocent blood of\r\nmy aunt, _the prop and ruler of my family_, was shed, and in the same\r\nmanner I, too, was wounded. Until now I feel the pain and affliction of\r\nmy wounds; _and no person has regarded my solicitations for redress,\r\nsought after the assassin, and brought him to condign punishment,\r\nyourself excepted_.\"--\"In like manner as the Honorable Governor-General\r\nhas adopted my brother Saadut Ali Khân for his son and relieved him from\r\nthe vexation, affliction, and dependence of this place, would it be\r\nextraordinary that you also should, in your bounty and favor, consent to\r\nadopt me, who do not possess the necessaries of life, and permit me to\r\nattend you to whatever part of the world you may travel, whereby I shall\r\nat all times derive honor and advantage? Formerly us three brothers,\r\nSaadut Ali, Mirza Jungly, and I, the poor and oppressed, were, in the\r\npresence of our blessed father, whose soul rests in heaven, treated\r\nalike. Now the ministers of this government put me upon a footing with\r\nour younger brothers, who have lately left the zenanah, and whose\r\nexpenses are small. On this scale, which is in every respect\r\ninsufficient for my maintenance, they pay _the pitiful allowance only\r\nwhen it is their pleasure to do it_. My situation has for years past\r\nbeen increasing in wretchedness to a degree that _I am in want of daily\r\nbread, and my servants and animals are dying of hunger. My distresses\r\nare so great that I have not been able to pay a daum to the surgeons for\r\nthe cure of my wounds; and they, too, are discouraged from affording me\r\ntheir assistance or furnishing me with medicines_. How, then, is it\r\npossible for me to exist? Considering you as my patron, participating in\r\nmy afflictions, I have represented the circumstances concerning my\r\nsituation; and I hope, from your friendship, that you will honor me with\r\na favorable answer.\"\r\n\r\nXLVII. The Resident, Bristow, did also receive a strong application from\r\nthree others of the brethren of the reigning sovereign, called Mirza\r\nHyder Ali, Mirza Ennayut Ali, and Mirza Syef Ali, representing their\r\nvery pitiable case, in a letter of the 9th of March, 1783, in which,\r\namong other particulars, are contained the following.\r\n\r\n\"Our situation is not fit to be represented. _For two years we have not\r\nreceived a hubba_ on account of our tuncaw [assignment on the revenue],\r\nthough the ministers have annually charged a lac of rupees, and never\r\npaid us anything. _After all, we are the sons of Sujah ul Dowlah!_ It is\r\nsurprising, having such a friend as you, our situation is arrived at\r\nthat pass that we should be in distress for _dry bread and clothes_.\r\nWhereas you have done many generous acts, be pleased so to show us your\r\nfavor, that by some means we may receive our allowances from the\r\nCompany's treasury, and not be obliged to depend upon and solicit others\r\nfor it.\"\r\n\r\nXLVIII. That one of the princes aforesaid, called the Mirza Jungly,\r\nabout the beginning of the year 1783, was obliged to fly from the\r\ndominions of the Nabob of Oude, and to leave his country and\r\nconnections; and as the Resident, Bristow, writing from Lucknow, hath\r\nobserved, \"he went to try his fortune at other courts, in preference to\r\nstarving at home, which might have been his fate, by all accounts, at\r\nthis place.\" And the said prince sought for succor at the court of one\r\nof the neighboring Mahomedan princes; but conceiving some disgust at the\r\ntreatment he met with there, he departed from thence, and on the 8th of\r\nFebruary, 1783, arrived at the Mahratta camp, while David Anderson,\r\nEsquire, was there in the character of Minister Plenipotentiary to the\r\nCompany, with a view, if his reception there should not prove answerable\r\nto his wishes, to pass on to the southward. And the said Anderson,\r\nprobably considering this event as of very great importance to the honor\r\nof the British government, as well as to its interest, on the one hand,\r\nby exhibiting the son and brother of a sovereign prince, from whom the\r\nCompany had received many millions of money, a fugitive from his\r\ncountry, and a wanderer for bread through the courts of India, and, on\r\nthe other, the consequences which might arise from the Mahrattas having\r\nin their possession and under their influence a son of the late Nabob of\r\nOude, did without delay advise Warren Hastings, Esquire, of the event\r\naforesaid; and he did also write to Mr. Bristow, the Resident at the\r\ncourt of the Nabob Vizier, several letters, of the 9th and 20th of\r\nFebruary, and of the 6th of March and 6th of April, 1783, in order that\r\nsome steps should be taken for his return and establishment in his own\r\ncountry. And the said Anderson did inform the Resident, Bristow, in his\r\nletter aforesaid, that, on the arrival of the fugitive prince, brother\r\nof the reigning sovereign of Oude, at the Mahratta camp, he did cause\r\nhis tent to be pitched close to that of Mr. Anderson; but finding this\r\nnot agreeable to the Mahratta general, Sindia, he afterwards removed:\r\nand that he showed a strong attachment to the English, and was inclined\r\nto throw himself upon their generosity; that he was desirous of going to\r\nCalcutta, and declared, that, if he, the said Anderson, \"would give him\r\nthe smallest encouragement, he would quit all his followers, and come\r\nalone, and would take up his residence under his protection.\" And the\r\nsaid Anderson did declare, that he thought it \"would be policy, and much\r\nto the credit of our government, that some provision should be made for\r\nMirza Jungly in our territories.\"\r\n\r\nXLIX. That the said Bristow did represent the aforesaid circumstances to\r\nHyder Beg Khân, minister to the Nabob of Oude, declaring it his\r\nopinion, \"that his Highness's brother's thus taking refuge with a\r\nforeign prince is a reflection upon the Vizier, and it would be\r\nadvisable that an allowance should be granted to him upon the footing of\r\nhis brothers, that he might remain in the presence.\" But the Nabob was\r\ninduced to refuse to his brother any offer of any allowance beyond the\r\ntwo hundred pounds per month, allowed, but not paid, to his other\r\nbrothers,--and which the said prince did observe to Mr. Anderson, \"that\r\nit was not only inadequate to his expenses, but infinitely less\" (as the\r\ntruth was) \"than what his Excellency has settled on many persons of\r\ninferior rank, who have not so good a claim to his support; and that it\r\nwould not be sufficient to enable him to live at Lucknow, where all his\r\nfriends and relations were, and so many of his inferiors lived in a\r\nstate of affluence.\" In case, therefore, it could not be increased, he\r\nrequested leave to live in the Company's provinces, or at Calcutta; for\r\nthat in any of these situations \"he could with less difficulty regulate\r\nhis expenses.\" And he did declare, that, if his request was granted to\r\nhim, he would immediately quit all his prospects with Sindia. To these\r\npropositions he received a very discouraging answer from his brother's\r\nminister, containing a positive and final refusal of any increase of\r\nallowance, obtaining only the Nabob's permission to retire into the\r\nCompany's provinces. But Mr. Anderson did not think himself authorized\r\nto take any steps for the prince's retreat into the said province\r\nwithout Sindia's concurrence, who, he observed, would use every art to\r\ndetain him, and accordingly did offer him the command of a battalion of\r\ninfantry to be paid directly from his own treasury, and six thousand\r\npounds sterling a year for keeping up a corps of horse, and to settle\r\nupon him a landed estate of four thousand pounds a year as a provision\r\nfor his wife and children: which honorable offers it appears he did\r\naccept, and did and doth remain in the Mahratta service.\r\n\r\nL. That, during the whole course of this transaction, the said Warren\r\nHastings was duly advised thereof, first by a very early letter from the\r\nsaid Anderson, and afterwards by the Resident, Bristow, who, on the 23d\r\nof April, 1783, transmitted to him his whole correspondence with Mr.\r\nAnderson. But what answer or instructions the said Warren Hastings did\r\ngive to Mr. Anderson does not appear, he not having recorded anything\r\nupon that subject; but it appears that to the Resident, Bristow, who\r\nrequired to be informed whether the reception of the fugitive prince\r\naforesaid in the Company's provinces would meet his approbation, he gave\r\nno answer whatsoever: by which criminal neglect, or worse, with regard\r\nto a brother of an ally of the Company, who showed a strong attachment\r\nand preference to the English nation, and by suffering him, without any\r\nknown effort to prevent it, to attach himself to the cause and fortunes\r\nof the Mahrattas, who, he, the said Hastings, well knew, did keep up\r\nclaims upon several parts of the dominions of Oude, and had with\r\ndifficulty been persuaded to include the Nabob in the treaty of peace,\r\nhe, having suffered him first to languish at home in poverty, and then\r\nto fly abroad for subsistence, and afterwards taking no step and\r\ncountenancing no negotiations for his return from his dangerous place of\r\nrefuge, at the same time that several of his, the said Hastings's,\r\ncreatures had each of them allowances much more considerable than would\r\nhave sufficed for the satisfaction and comfort of him, the said fugitive\r\nprince, was guilty of a high crime and misdemeanor.\r\n\r\nLI. That the indigent condition before related of the other brothers of\r\nthe Nabob was also duly transmitted to the said Warren Hastings; but he\r\ndid never order or direct any steps whatsoever to be taken towards the\r\nrelief of the family of a reigning prince, who were daily in danger of\r\nperishing by famine through the effect of his measures, and those of a\r\nperson whom he supported in power against the will and inclinations of\r\nthe said prince and his family.\r\n\r\nLII. That the foregoing instances of the penury, distress, dispersion,\r\nand exile of the reigning family, as well as the general disorder in all\r\nthe affairs of Oude, did strongly enforce the necessity of a proper use\r\nof the British influence (the only real government then existing) in the\r\nprovince aforesaid for a regulation of the economy of the Vizier's\r\ncourt, as well as for the proper administration of the public concerns,\r\ncivil and military, which were in the greatest disorder; and the said\r\nWarren Hastings was under obligation to provide for the same, and did\r\nhimself understand it to be his duty so to do, and that he was therein\r\nwarranted by the spirit of the treaty of Chunar, as well as by other\r\nuniversal powers of control, and even of supersession, supposed by him\r\nto exist in the relation between the British government and that of\r\nOude; and accordingly he did, in his instructions to the Resident\r\nMiddleton, to which he required his most implicit obedience, direct him\r\nto an interference in and control upon all the affairs concerning the\r\nrevenues, the military arrangements, and all the other branches of the\r\nNabob's government.\r\n\r\nLIII. That, upon his recall of the said Middleton, he, in his\r\ninstructions to the Resident Bristow, dated 23d of October, 1781\r\n[1782?], did at large set forth the situation of the court and\r\ngovernment of Oude, the situation and character of the Nabob, of the\r\nacting minister, and of the British Resident at that court, and did\r\nplainly, distinctly, and without reserve, describe the extent of the\r\nauthority to be exercised by the last of these persons, as well as the\r\nunqualified compliance to be expected from the two former. And he did\r\naccordingly declare, that, \"_from the nature of our connection with the\r\ngovernment of Oude_, and from the Nabob's incapacity, _a necessity will\r\nforever exist_, while we have the claim of a subsidy upon the resources\r\nof his country, of exercising an influence, and frequently substituting\r\nit _ENTIRELY in the place of an avowed and constitutional authority, in\r\nthe administration of his [the Nabob's] government_\"; and he did further\r\nin the said instructions, namely, in instruction the fourth, direct the\r\nsaid Resident in the words following: \"I must have recourse to you for\r\nthe introduction of a _new_ system in that government; nor can I omit,\r\nwhilst I express my reliance on you for that purpose, to repeat the\r\nsentiments which I expressed in the verbal instructions which I gave you\r\nat your departure, _that there can be no medium in the relation between\r\nthe Resident and the minister, but either the Resident must be the slave\r\nand vassal of the minister, or the minister at the absolute disposal of\r\nthe Resident_.\" And he, the said Hastings, did state, in the same\r\narticle of the instructions aforesaid, that, though the conduct of the\r\nsaid Hyder Beg Khân had been highly reprehensible, and that he was much\r\ndispleased thereat, he would prefer him to any other, on account of his\r\nability and knowledge of business, with the following proviso,--\"If he\r\nwould submit to hold his office on such conditions as I require. He\r\nexists by his dependence on the influence of our government. It must be\r\nadvisable to try him by the mode of conciliation; at the same time that\r\nin your _final conversation with him_ it will be necessary to declare to\r\nhim, _in the plainest terms_, the footing and condition on which he\r\nshall be _permitted_ to retain his place, with the alternative of a\r\ndismission, and a scrutiny into his conduct, if he refuses it. In the\r\nfirst place, I will not receive from the Nabob, _as his_, letters\r\ndictated by _the spirit of opposition_; but shall consider every such\r\nattempt _as an insult on our government_. In the second place, I shall\r\nexpect that _nothing_ is done in his official character but with your\r\nknowledge and participation.\"\r\n\r\nLIV. That the said Hastings having described, in the manner aforesaid,\r\nthe relative situation of the Resident and the minister, he did state\r\nalso the relative situation of the said minister and his master, the\r\nNabob, declaring, \"that the minister did hold _without control_ the\r\nunparticipated and entire administration, with all the powers annexed to\r\nthat government,--_the Nabob being, as he ever must be in the hands of\r\nsome person, a mere cipher in his_\" (the minister's). And having thus\r\nstated the subordination of the minister to the Resident, and the\r\nsubordination of the Nabob to the minister, he did naturally declare,\r\n\"that the first share of the responsibility would rest upon the said\r\nResident\" And he did further declare, \"that the other conditions did\r\nfollow distinctly in their places, because he did _consider the Resident\r\nas responsible for them_.\"\r\n\r\nLV. That, for the direction of the Resident in the exercise of so\r\ncritical a trust, wherein all the true and substantial powers of\r\ngovernment were in an inverted relation and proportion to the official\r\nand ostensible authorities, and in which the said Hastings did suppose\r\nthe necessity constantly existing for exercising an influence, and\r\nfrequently for substituting _entirely_ the British authority \"in the\r\nplace of the avowed and constitutional government,\" he, the said\r\nHastings, did properly leave to the Resident a discretionary power for\r\nhis deviation from any part of his instructions,--interposing a caution\r\nfor his security and direction, that, as much as he could, he would\r\nleave the subject free for his, the said Hastings's, correction of it,\r\nand would instantly inform him or the board, according to the degree of\r\nits importance, with his reasons for it.\r\n\r\nLVI. That, besides the institution of the courts of justice, as before\r\nrecited, four other principal objects in the reformation of the affairs\r\nof Oude were expressly recommended to the Residents Middleton and\r\nBristow, and must be understood to be the conditions upon which the said\r\nHastings must have meant to have it understood that the acting minister\r\nof Oude was to hold his employment: namely, the limitation of the\r\nNabob's personal expenses; the reduction of the Nabob's troops in\r\nnumber, and the change in arrangement; the appointment of proper\r\ncollectors for the revenues; and the appointment of proper officers for\r\nall parts of the executive administration.\r\n\r\nLVII. That the first object, namely, that of the limitation of the\r\nNabob's personal expenses, and separating them from the public\r\nestablishments, he, the said Hastings, did state as the first and\r\nfundamental part of his regulation, and that upon which all the others\r\nwould depend,--and did declare, \"that, in order to prevent the Vizier's\r\nalliance from being a clog instead of an aid to the Company, _the most\r\nessential_ part is to _limit_ and _separate_ his personal disbursements\r\nfrom the public accounts: _they must not exceed_ what he has received in\r\nany of the last three years.\" And as to the public treasury and\r\ndisbursements, he, the said Hastings, did, in the said instructions,\r\nwholly withdraw them from the personal management or interference of the\r\nNabob, and did expressly order and direct \"that they should be under the\r\n_sole_ management of the ministers, with the Resident's concurrence.\"\r\nAnd on the appointment of the Resident Bristow, in October, 1782, he,\r\nthe said Hastings, did order and direct him in every point of the\r\ninstructions to Middleton not revoked or qualified by his then\r\ninstructions, to which he did require his, the said Resident Bristow's,\r\n\"most attentive and literal obedience.\"\r\n\r\nLVIII. That the said Resident Bristow did, in consequence of the renewal\r\nto him of the said instructions as aforesaid, endeavor to limit and put\r\nin order the Nabob's expenses; but he was in that particular traversed\r\nand counteracted, and in the end wholly defeated, by the minister, Hyder\r\nBeg Khân. And though the obstructions aforesaid, agreeably to the\r\ninstructions given to Middleton, and to him, the said Bristow, were\r\nrepresented to the said Warren Hastings by the Resident aforesaid, yet\r\nthe said Warren Hastings did give no kind of support to the said\r\nResident, or take any steps towards enabling him, the said Resident, to\r\neffectuate the said necessary limitation and distribution of expenses,\r\nby himself, the said Hastings, ordered and prescribed; nor, if he\r\ndisapproved the proceedings of the said Resident, did he give him any\r\ninstruction for the forbearance of the same, or for the exerting his\r\nduty in any other mode; nor did he call for any illustration from him of\r\nanything doubtful in his correspondence, nor state to him any complaint\r\nmade privately of his conduct, in order to receive thereon an\r\nexplanation; but he did leave him to pursue at his discretion the\r\nextensive powers before described, to effect the reformation which he\r\nwas directed to accomplish, under the responsibility denounced to him as\r\naforesaid, if he should fail therein, as he was supposed to be\r\nsubstantially invested with all the powers of government.\r\n\r\nLIX. That, instead of the said support or instruction, he, the said\r\nHastings, did countenance, or more probably cause or direct, a\r\nrepresentation to be made to him by the acting minister of the Nabob of\r\nOude, complaining grievously of the proceedings of the Resident\r\naforesaid, as usurpations on the Nabob's authority and indignities on\r\nhis person. And although he, the said Hastings, did instruct the\r\nResident, Bristow, to inform the said Hyder Beg Khân that he would not\r\nreceive from the Nabob, as _his_, letters directed by the spirit of\r\nopposition, but should consider every such attempt as his, the\r\nminister's, as an insult on our government, yet he did receive as _his_\r\nthe Nabob's own letters, and as written from the impressions on his own\r\nmind, and as the suggestions of his own judgment, letters to the same\r\neffect as those written by the minister, although he had declared upon\r\nrecord that the said \"Nabob was a mere cipher in his, the said\r\nminister's, hands,\" and \"that he had dared to use both the Nabob's name,\r\nand even his seal, affixed to letters either directed to the Nabob or\r\nwritten as from him without his knowledge,\" and although he did assert\r\nor record as aforesaid, that, in a letter which he had lately received\r\nfrom the Nabob, the minister had the presumption to make the Nabob\r\ndeclare that which was _true_ to be _false_, and that \"his _making use_\r\nof the Nabob in such a manner did show how thin the veil was by which\r\n_he_ covered _his own acts_, and that such artifices would only tend to\r\nmake them the more criminal from _the falsehood and duplicity with which\r\nthey were associated_.\"\r\n\r\nLX. That the said Hastings did act upon the letters pretended to be\r\nwritten by the Nabob, as well as on those actually written by the\r\nminister, without previously communicating the matter of the said\r\ncomplaint to the said Resident, and did give credit to the same, and\r\ncoming, as aforesaid, from a person by himself, the said Hastings,\r\ncharged with artifice, falsehood, and duplicity, and with abusing to his\r\nown evil purposes the name and seal of his master without his knowledge,\r\nand without any previous inquiry into the facts and circumstances; and\r\ndid thereon ground an accusation against the said Resident, Bristow,\r\nbefore the board at Calcutta, in which he did represent the conduct of\r\nthe said Bristow, in attempting to limit the household expenses of the\r\nNabob, as an indignity \"which no man living, however mean his rank in\r\nlife, or dependent his condition in it, would permit to be exercised by\r\nany other, but with the want or forfeiture of every manly principle.\"\r\nAnd he did further accuse the said Bristow for that, in his proceedings\r\nin the regulation of the Nabob's household, \"he should receive to\r\nhimself, or Mr. Cowper for him, or a treasurer for both, (for the\r\narrangement has never been well defined,) the money assigned for the\r\nsupport of the Nabob's household,--issue it as he pleased, not to the\r\nNabob, but to the menial officers of his household,--dispose of his\r\nsuperfluous horses, and other cattle,--determine how many elephants were\r\nnecessary to the state of the Vizier of the Empire, the number of\r\ndomestics for his attendance, and pry into the kitchen for the purpose\r\nof ascertaining the quantity of victuals which ought to be dressed in\r\nit,--control the accounts of these disbursements,--and appropriate to\r\nhis own use (for that the consequence was inevitable, if he chose it)\r\nthe residue produced by those economical retrenchments.\"\r\n\r\nLXI. That the said charge is malicious and insidious; because the\r\nattempt to introduce proper officers for the management of household\r\nexpenses so considerable that the said Hastings has stated the allotment\r\nfor the same at three hundred thousand pounds sterling yearly, and that\r\nother accounts have carried it to four hundred thousand pounds sterling\r\nand upwards, and to keep proper and regular accounts thereof, was a\r\nnecessary regulation, and agreeable to the dignity of the Nabob, and by\r\nno means a degradation either of his person or authority, which was\r\nspecially provided for in the regulations, as no expense could be\r\nincurred but by his own personal warrant under his sign manual; nor doth\r\nthere appear therein anything but what is of absolute necessity to\r\nprevent embezzlement to his prejudice. And the said Hastings hath\r\ndeclared, in the fifth article of the instructions to the said Resident,\r\nthat _no_ administration can be properly conducted without regular\r\noffices; and that in the whole province of Oude \"there was _not one_,\r\nthe _whole_ being engrossed by the minister\": of which minister, in the\r\nfourteenth article, he declares his suspicion that the Nabob did not\r\nreceive the whole and punctual payment of the sum assigned for the\r\npurpose of the household, but that some part had been by him withheld\r\nfrom the Nabob; and that, from private information he had lately\r\nreceived, he had reason to believe that this was actually the case. And\r\nthe said Hastings well knew that the Nabob's household had been ill\r\nconducted, that the allowances of his servants had not been paid, that\r\nhis distress was scandalous, and that his nearest relations were in a\r\nfamishing condition; and the said Hastings did also well know that the\r\nhousehold of the Nabob was provided for or neglected, not at his own\r\ndiscretion, but at that of the said Hyder Beg Khân; and he did, in the\r\nfourteenth article aforesaid, instruct the Resident, Bristow, to show\r\nevery ostensible and external mark of respect to the Nabob, in order to\r\ninduce him to become himself the mover of every act necessary for the\r\nadvancing of his own interests and the discharge of his debts to the\r\nCompany,--declaring, \"that they never could be effected while the\r\nminister retained that ascendency over him which he at present holds by\r\nthe means of a nearer and more private intercourse, and by affecting to\r\nbe the mediator of his rights against the claims of our government.\" And\r\nthe said Hastings did further well know that there was no way of\r\nascertaining the payment of the assignments for the Nabob's household,\r\neither for the general purposes of their destination or to the\r\nparticular objects to which they ought to be applied, without regular\r\noffices of receipt and of account, which might prevent the said\r\nminister, Hyder Beg Khân, or the British Resident, or any other, from\r\nembezzling or misapplying the same. But the total want of offices\r\naforesaid in every department of government did furnish occasion of\r\nconcealing all frauds, clandestine presents, or pensions to a\r\nGovernor-General, Commander-in-Chief, or other servant of the Company.\r\n\r\nLXII. That the said Warren Hastings, who did pretend so deep a concern\r\nfor the indignities supposed to be suffered by the Nabob merely in the\r\nlimitation and regulation of unnecessary expenses relative to his\r\nkitchen, domestics, &c., did show no attention or compassion to the said\r\nNabob, when, in the year 1779, the said Nabob represented, that the\r\npensions of his old servants for thirty years, the expenses of his\r\nfamily and kitchen, together with the jaghires of his grandmother,\r\nmother, and aunts, and of his brothers and dependants, given for their\r\nsupport, were not _regulated_, but _stopped_.\r\n\r\nLXIII. That the other articles of regulation, namely, the reform of the\r\ntroops in number and in arrangement, the appointment of proper\r\ncollectors for the revenues, and the general constitution of offices for\r\nthe executive administration, were in like manner totally defeated by\r\nthe said Hyder Beg Khân. And the said Hastings did receive a charge from\r\nhim, and did adopt it as his own, representing the endeavors of the\r\nResident to act in the regulations aforesaid agreeably to the spirit of\r\nhis instructions, and in confidence of the powers vested in and the\r\nresponsibility imposed upon him, the said Resident, as usurpations of\r\nthe authority and prerogative of the Nabob; and he, the said Hastings,\r\ndid make criminal charges thereon against the said Resident, Bristow, of\r\nwhich charges the Council Board did, on hearing the same, and the\r\ndefence of the said Bristow, fully acquit him.\r\n\r\nLXIV. That the said Hastings, by abetting Hyder Beg Khân, a person\r\ndescribed by him as aforesaid, in his opposition to all the plans of\r\nnecessary reformation proposed by the said Hastings himself, and having\r\nsuggested no other whatever in lieu thereof, to answer the purposes for\r\nwhich he had stipulated in the treaty of Chunar the interference of the\r\nResident in every branch of the Nabob's government, did thereby\r\nfrustrate every one of the good ends proposed by him in the said treaty\r\nof Chunar, and did grossly abuse his trust in giving the exorbitant\r\npowers before recited, and asserting them to exist in the British\r\nResident, without suffering them even in appearance to answer any of the\r\nproper and justifiable ends for which any power or influence can or\r\nought to exist in any government.\r\n\r\nLXV. That there is just ground to violently presume that not only the\r\nletters in the name of the Nabob aforesaid were dictated to him by his\r\nminister, Hyder Beg Khân, in whose hands the said Hastings has described\r\nhis master to be \"a mere cipher,\" &c., but which Hyder Beg was the known\r\ninstrument of the said Hastings, but that the conduct and letters of\r\ncomplaint of the said Hyder Beg were in effect and substance prescribed\r\nand dictated to him by the said Warren Hastings, or his secret agent,\r\nPalmer, by his direction: because it is notorious that the powers of the\r\nsaid Hyder Beg were solely supported by him, the said Hastings, who,\r\naccording to the state of favor or displeasure in which he stood, hath\r\nfrequently promised him support or threatened him with dismission and\r\npunishment, and therefore it is not to be thought that he would take so\r\nmaterial a step as to oppose the Company's Resident, acting under the\r\ninstructions of the Governor-General and Council, and to accuse him with\r\nso much confidence, and in a manner so different from the usual style of\r\nsupplication on all other occasions employed by that court, if he had\r\nnot been previously well assured that his writing in that manner would\r\nbe pleasing to the person upon whom he solely depended for his power,\r\nhis fortune, and perhaps for his life;--secondly, because, when it\r\nsuited the purposes of the said Hastings on a former occasion, that is,\r\nin the year 1784 [1781?], to remove the Resident Bristow aforesaid from\r\nhis office, a letter from the Nabob was laid before the Council Board at\r\nCalcutta, proposing, that, in order to prevent the effects of the said\r\nBristow's application to Europe for redress, the said Hastings should\r\nsend him drafts of letters which he, the said Nabob, would write in his\r\nown name and character to the King, to his Majesty's ministers, and to\r\nthe Court of Directors, expressing himself, in the letter aforesaid, in\r\nthe words following, viz., \"To prevent his [Bristow's] applying to\r\nEurope, send me, if _you_ think proper, the drafts of letters which _I_\r\nmay write to the King, the Vizier, and the chiefs of the\r\nCompany\";--thirdly, that, though the said Hastings, and his secret\r\nagent, Palmer, did pretend and positively assert that they had no share\r\nin the letters aforesaid from the Nabob and his minister, there was an\r\noriginal note to the Nabob's letters of accusation, referring to\r\ndistinct parts and specified numbers of the agent Palmer's secret\r\ncorrespondence with the said Warren Hastings, and the said letter, with\r\nthe said reference, was, through inadvertence, laid before the board.\r\n\r\nLXVI. That the said Warren Hastings, having thrown the government of\r\nOude into great confusion and distress, and thereby prevented the\r\ndischarge of the debt, or pretended debt, to the Company, did, by all\r\nthe said intrigues, machinations, and charges, aim at the filling the\r\nsaid office of Resident at Oude with his own dependants or by himself\r\npersonally; as it appears that he did first propose to place in the said\r\noffice his secret agent, Palmer, and that afterwards, when he was not\r\nable to succeed therein, he did propose nominally to abolish the said\r\noffice, but in effect to fill it by himself,--proposing to the Council\r\nand rendering himself responsible (but not in fortune) for the payment\r\nof the Company's debt within a certain given time, if he were permitted\r\nand commissioned by the Council to act for the board in that province,\r\nand did inform them that he was privately well assured that in a few\r\ndays he should receive an invitation to that effect; and he did state,\r\n(as in the year 1781 he had stated as a reason for his former\r\ndelegation,) \"that the state of the country was so disordered in its\r\nrevenue and administration, and the credit and influence of the Nabob\r\nhimself so much shook by _the late usurpation_ of his authority, and the\r\ncontests which attended it, as to require the accession of an\r\nextraneous aid to restore the powers and to reanimate the constitution\r\nof his government,\"--although he, the said Hastings, did for a long time\r\nbefore attribute the weakness of his government to an extraneous\r\ninterference. And the said Council, on his engagement aforesaid, did\r\nconsent thereto; and he did accordingly receive a commission, enabling\r\nhim to act in the affairs of Oude, not only as the Resident might have\r\ndone, but as largely as the Council-General might legally delegate their\r\nown powers.\r\n\r\nLXVII. That the said Warren Hastings, in accepting the said commission,\r\ndid subject his character and the reputation of his office to great\r\nimputations and suspicions, by taking upon himself an inferior office,\r\nout of which another had upon his intrigues been removed by a perpetual\r\nobstruction which rendered it impossible for him to perform his duty or\r\nto obey his instructions; and he did increase the said grounded\r\nsuspicions by exercising that office in a government from whence it was\r\nnotorious he had himself received an unlawful gift and present from the\r\nministers, and in which he had notoriously suffered many, and had\r\nhimself actually directed some, acts of peculation, by granting various\r\npensions and emoluments, to the prejudice of the revenue of a distressed\r\ncountry, which he was not authorized to grant.\r\n\r\nLXVIII. That the said Warren Hastings did proceed unto the said province\r\nof Oude under color of providing a remedy for the disorders described to\r\nbe existing in the same, and for the recovery of the Company's\r\npretended debt. And the said Warren Hastings, who had thought fit to\r\nrecall the Company's Resident, appointed to that office by the Court of\r\nDirectors, and to suspend his office, did, notwithstanding, of his own\r\nchoice and selection, and on his own mere authority, take with him in\r\nhis progress a large retinue, \"and a numerous society of English\r\ngentlemen to compose his family,\" which he represents as necessary,\r\nalthough, in a letter from that very place to which he took that very\r\nnumerous society, he informs the Court of Directors \"that his own\r\nconsequence and that of the nation he represents are independent of\r\nshow.\" And after his arrival there, he, the said Warren Hastings, did\r\nwrite from Lucknow, the capital of that province, a letter, dated the\r\n30th of April, 1784, to the Court of Directors, in which are several\r\nparticulars to the following purport or tenor, and which he points out\r\nto the Directors \"to be circumstances of no trivial information,\"\r\nnamely,--\"that he had found that the lands in that province, as well as\r\nin some parts more immediately under the Company, have suffered in a\r\ngrievous manner, being completely exhausted of their natural moisture by\r\nthe total failure of one entire season of the periodical rains,\" with a\r\nfew exceptions, which were produced only \"by the uncommon labor of the\r\nhusbandman.\" And in a letter to Edward Wheler, Esquire, a member of the\r\nCouncil-General, from Benares, the 20th of September, 1784, he says,\r\nthat \"_the public revenues_ had declined with the failure of the\r\ncultivation _in three successive years_; and all the stores of grain\r\nwhich the _providence_ of the husbandmen, (as he was informed is their\r\n_custom_,) in defiance of the _vigilance_ of the aumils [collectors],\r\n_clandestinely reserved for their own use_, were of course exhausted,\r\nin which state no person would accept of the charge of the collections\r\non a positive engagement; nor did the rain fall till the 10th of July.\"\r\nAnd in another letter, dated from Benares, the 1st of October following,\r\nhe repeats the same accounts, and that the \"country could not bear\r\nfurther additions of expense: that it had _no inlets of trade_ to supply\r\nthe issues that were made from it\" (the exceptions stated there being\r\ninconsiderable); \"therefore _every rupee_ which is drawn into your\r\ntreasury [the Company's] from its circulation will accelerate the period\r\nat which its ability must cease _to pay even the stipulated subsidy_.\"\r\nNotwithstanding this state of the country, of which he was well apprised\r\nbefore he left Calcutta, and the poverty and distress of the prince\r\nhaving been frequently, but in vain, represented to him, in order to\r\ninduce him to forbear his oppressive exactions, he did, in order to\r\nfurnish the Council with a color for permitting him to recall the\r\nCompany's Resident, and to exercise the whole powers of the Company in\r\nhis own person, without any check whatsoever, or witness of his\r\nproceedings, except the persons of his own private choice, make the\r\nexpress and positive engagement aforesaid, which, if understood of a\r\nreal and substantial discharge of debt for the relief of the total of\r\nthe Company's finances, was grossly fallacious: because at the very time\r\nhe must have been perfectly sensible, that, in the then state of the\r\nrevenues and country of Oude, (which are in effect the Company's\r\nrevenues and the Company's country,) the debt or pretended debt\r\naforesaid, asserted to be about five hundred thousand pounds, or\r\nthereabouts, could not be paid without contracting another debt at an\r\nusurious interest, without encroaching on the necessary establishments\r\nor on private property or on the pay of the army, or without grievous\r\noppression of the country, or all these together. And it doth appear\r\nthat one hundred thousand pounds towards the said payment of debts was\r\nborrowed at Calcutta by the Nabob's agent there, but at what interest is\r\nnot known; it appears also that other sums were borrowed for arrear of\r\nthe interest, on which forty thousand pounds sterling appears in the\r\nCompany's claims for the current year, and that various deductions were\r\nmade from the jaghires restored to the Begums, as well as other parts of\r\nthe Nabob's family; and it did and doth appear that an arrear is still\r\ndue to the old and new brigade,--but whether the same be growing or not\r\ndoth not appear: yet he hath not hesitated to assert that he had\r\n\"provided for the _complete_ discharge, in _one_ year, of a debt\r\ncontracted by _the accumulation of many_, and from a country whose\r\nresources have been wasted and dissipated by three successive years of\r\ndrought and one of anarchy.\" But the said Hastings never did even\r\nrealize the payments to be made in the first year, (as he confesses in\r\nthe said letter,) except by an anticipation of the second; and though he\r\nstates in his letter aforesaid the following facts and engagements, that\r\nis to say, \"_that a recovery of so large a part of your property_ [the\r\nCompany's] will afford a seasonable and substantial relief to the\r\nnecessities of your government, and enable it (for such is my confident\r\nhope) _to begin on the reduction of your debt at interest_ before the\r\nconclusion of this year (I mean the year of this computation).\" Whereas\r\nthe said Warren Hastings did apply the whole produce of the revenue to\r\nthe mere pay of some part of the British army in Oude; and did not\r\nmention in his correspondence that he had remitted any money whatsoever\r\nto Calcutta, nor to any other place, (except the fifty thousand pounds\r\ntaken from Almas Ali Khân, and said to be remitted to Surat,) for the\r\nsaid \"substantial relief,\" in consequence of the said pretended\r\n\"recovery of property,\"--admitting that it had been suggested to him,\r\nand not by him denied, that he had \"disappointed the popular expectation\r\nby not adopting the policy which he had, _on the conception of better\r\ngrounds_, rejected; nor did he begin the reduction of the interest debt\"\r\nat the time stated, nor at any time; but the whole (he well knowing the\r\nstate of the country from whence the resources aforesaid were by him\r\npromised) was a premeditated deceit and imposition on the Board of\r\nCouncil, his colleagues, and on the Court of Directors, his masters.\r\n\r\nLXIX. That no traces of regulation appear to have been adopted by the\r\nsaid Warren Hastings during his residence at Lucknow, in conformity to\r\nthe spirit and intentions of the treaty of Chunar, or of his\r\ninstructions to Middleton and Bristow, or of the proposed objects of his\r\nown commission. But he did, in lieu thereof, pretend to free the Nabob's\r\ngovernment from the interference of the Company's servants, and the\r\nusurpation (as he called it) of a Resident, and thereby to restore it to\r\nits proper tone and energy; whereas the measures he took were such as to\r\nleave no useful or responsible superintendence in the British, and no\r\nfreedom in the Nabob's government: for he did confirm the sole,\r\nunparticipated, and entire administration, with all the powers annexed\r\nto the government, on the minister, Hyder Beg Khân, to whom he\r\n_prevailed_ on the Nabob Vizier to commit the entire charge of his\r\nrevenues, although he knew that his master was a cipher in his\r\nhands,--that he \"had affixed his seal to letters written without his\r\nknowledge, and such as evidently tended to promote Hyder Beg Khân's\r\ninfluence and interest,\"--that his said master did not consider him as a\r\nminister of his choice, but as an instrument of his degradation,--that\r\n\"he exists as a minister by his dependence on the Calcutta government,\r\nand that the Nabob himself had no other opinion of him,--that it is by\r\nits _declared_ and most _obvious_ support _alone_ that he could maintain\r\nhis authority and influence.\" And in his instructions to his secret\r\nagent, Major Palmer, dated 6th of May, 1782, to ease his mind and remove\r\nhis jealousy with regard to British interference, he did instruct him,\r\n\"that much delicacy and caution will be required in your declarations on\r\nthis subject, lest they should be construed to extend to an immediate\r\nchange in the administration of his affairs, or the instruments of it.\r\nTheir persons must be considered as _sacred, while_ they act with the\r\n_participation of our influence_. This distinction the Nabob\r\n_understands_; nor will it be either necessary or proper to allude to\r\nit, unless he himself should first introduce the subject.\" And the said\r\nHastings did assume, as to a dependant of the lowest order, to prescribe\r\nto him the conditions on which he is to hold his place,--to threaten him\r\nwith scrutinies into his conduct, with dismission, with\r\npunishment,--that he was guilty of falsehood and duplicity, and that he\r\nhad made his master assert what was true to be false,--that he suspected\r\nhe had withheld from his master what he ought to have paid to him,--that\r\nthe event of his having _prevailed_ on the Nabob to intrust him as\r\naforesaid was, according to his, the said Hastings's, own letter,\r\nwritten to the said Hyder Beg Khân himself, \"an accumulation of\r\ndistress, debasement, and dissatisfaction to the Nabob, and of\r\ndisappointment and disgrace to me. Every measure which he had himself\r\nproposed, and to which he had solicited my assistance, has been so\r\nconducted as to give him cause of displeasure; there are no officers\r\nestablished by which his affairs could be regularly conducted; mean,\r\nincapable, and indigent man have been appointed aumils of the districts,\r\nwithout authority, and without the means of personal protection; some of\r\nthem have been murdered by the zemindars, and those zemindars, instead\r\nof punishment, have been permitted to retain their zemindaries with\r\nindependent authority; all the other zemindars suffered to rise up in\r\nrebellion, and to insult the authority of the sircar, without any\r\nattempt made to suppress them; and the Company's debt, instead of being\r\ndischarged by the assignments, and extraordinary sources of money\r\nprovided for that purpose, is likely to exceed even the amount at which\r\nit stood at the time in which the arrangement with his Excellency was\r\nconcluded. _The growth of these evils was early made known to me, and\r\ntheir effects foreboded in the same order and manner as they have since\r\ncome to pass._ In such a state of calamity and disgrace, I can no longer\r\nremain a passive spectator; nor would it be becoming to conceal my\r\nsentiments, or qualify the expression of them. I now plainly tell you,\r\nthat you are answerable for every misfortune and defect of the Nabob\r\nVizier's government.\" And after giving orders, and expressing some hopes\r\nof better behavior, he adds, \"If I am disappointed, you will impose on\r\nme the painful and humiliating necessity of acknowledging to him that I\r\nhave been deceived, and of recommending the examination of your conduct\r\nto his justice, both for the redress of his own and the Company's\r\ngrievances, and for the injury sustained by both in their mutual\r\nconnection. _Do not reply to me_, that what I have written is from the\r\nsuggestion of your enemies; nor imagine that I have induced myself to\r\nwrite in such plain and declaratory terms, without a clear insight into\r\nall the consequences of it, and a fixed determination upon them.\"\r\n\r\nLXX. That the aforesaid being the tenure of the power of the said\r\nminister, and such his character, as given by the said Warren Hastings\r\nhimself, who did originally compel the Nabob to receive him, who did\r\nconstantly support him against the Nabob, his master, as well as against\r\nthe Company's Resident,--the delivering over to such a person his\r\nmaster, his family, his country, and the care of the British interests\r\ntherein, without control or public inspection, was an high crime and\r\nmisdemeanor.\r\n\r\nLXXI. That the next person whom the said Hastings did invest with power\r\nin the said country was a certain opulent and powerful native manager of\r\nrevenue, called Almas Ali Khân, closely connected with the said Hyder\r\nBeg Khân, and to whom the said Hyder Beg Khân, as the said Hastings has\r\nadmitted, \"had intrusted the _greatest_ part of his revenues, without\r\nany pledge or security for his fidelity.\" And afterwards the said\r\nHastings charges the said Almas Ali with an intention of removing from\r\nthe Nabob's dominions: he states, \"as taking with him,\" and therefore\r\nbeing possessed of, \"an immense treasure, the fruits of his\r\nembezzlements and oppressions, and an army raised for its protection.\"\r\n\r\nLXXII. That the said Warren Hastings was, or pretended to be, impressed\r\nwith the evil character, dangerous designs, and immoderate power of the\r\nsaid Almas Ali; that he did insert among his instructions to the\r\nResident Bristow an order of a dangerous and unwarrantable nature, in\r\nwhich, upon his, the said Hastings's, simple allegation of offences, not\r\naccurately described or specified, with regard either to the fact, the\r\nnature of the offence, or the proof, he was required to urge the Nabob\r\nto put him to death, with many qualifications in the said instructions,\r\nfull of fraud and duplicity, calculated to insnare the said Resident\r\nBristow, and to throw upon him the responsibility of the conduct of the\r\nsaid Almas Ali Khân, if he should continue at large contrary to his\r\norders, or to subject him, the said Resident, to the shame and scandal\r\nof apprehending and putting him to death by means which, in the\r\ncircumstances, must necessarily be such as would be construed into\r\ntreachery, and he, the said Almas Ali Khân, being from nature and\r\nsituation suspicious and watchful, and being at that very time in the\r\ncollection, or farmer of the most important part of the revenues, with\r\nan extensive jurisdiction annexed, and at the head of fourteen thousand\r\nof his own troops, and having been recently accepted by the Resident\r\nMiddleton as security for large sums of money advanced by the bankers of\r\nBenares to the use of the East India Company; which orders (if the said\r\nResident would or could have executed them) must have raised an\r\nuniversal alarm among all the considerable men of the country concerned\r\nin the government, and would have been a means of subverting the public\r\ncredit of the Company, by the murder of a person engaged for very great\r\nsums of money that had been advanced for their use. And the said\r\ninstruction is as followeth.\r\n\r\n\"If any engagement shall actually subsist between them at the time you\r\nhave charge of the Residency, it must, however exceptionable, be\r\nfaithfully observed; but if he has been guilty of any criminal offence\r\nto the Nabob, his master, for which no immunity is provided in the\r\nengagement, or he shall break any one of the conditions of it, I do most\r\nstrictly enjoin you, and it must be your special care to endeavor,\r\n_either by force or surprise_, to secure his person and bring him to\r\njustice. By bringing him to justice I mean, that you urge the Nabob, on\r\ndue conviction, _to punish him with death_, as a necessary example to\r\ndeter others from the commission of the like crimes; nor must you desist\r\ntill this is effected. I cannot prescribe the means; but to guard myself\r\nagainst the obloquy to which I may be exposed by a forced\r\nmisconstruction of this order by those who may hereafter be employed in\r\nsearching our records for cavils and informations against me, I think it\r\nproper to forbid and protest against the use of any _fraudulent artifice\r\nor treachery to accomplish the end which I have prescribed_; and as you\r\nalone are privy to the order, you will of course observe the greatest\r\nsecrecy, that it may not transpire: but I repeat my recommendation of\r\nit, as one of the first and most essential duties of your office.\"\r\n\r\nLXXIII. That, among the reasons assigned for putting to death the said\r\nAlmas Ali, which the said Hastings did recommend directly and repeatedly\r\nto the Resident, \"as one of the first and most essential duties of his\r\noffice,\" was, in substance, \"that, by his extensive trust with regard to\r\nthe revenues, he had been permitted to acquire independency; that the\r\nmeans thereof had been long seen and the effects thereof foretold by\r\nevery person acquainted with the state of government, except those\r\nimmediately interested in it\"; and he, the said Warren Hastings, did\r\nalso charge the said Almas Ali with embezzlement of the revenues and\r\noppression of the people; and nothing appears to disprove the same, but\r\nmuch to give ground to a presumption that the said Almas Ali did\r\ngrievously abuse the power committed to him, as farmer and collector of\r\nthe revenue, to the great oppression of the inhabitants of the countries\r\nwhich had been rented to him by Hyder Beg Khân with the knowledge and\r\nconsent of the said Warren Hastings.\r\n\r\nLXXIV. That the Resident, Bristow, declining the violent attempt on the\r\nlife of Almas Ali deceitfully ordered by the said Warren Hastings, did,\r\non weighty reasons, drawn from the spirit of the said Hastings's own\r\ninstructions, recommend that his, the said Almas Ali Khân's, farms of\r\nrevenue, or a great part of them, should be, on the expiration of his\r\nlease, taken out of his hands, as being too extensive, and supplying the\r\nmeans of a dangerous power in the country; but yet he, the said Warren\r\nHastings, did not only continue him in the possession of the said\r\nrevenues, but did give to him a new lease thereof for the term of five\r\nyears. And on this renovation and increase of trust, the said Warren\r\nHastings did not consent to produce the informer upon whose credit he\r\nhad made his charge of capital crimes on the said Almas Ali, and had\r\ndirected him to be put to death, or call upon him to make good his\r\ncharges; but, instead of this, totally changing his relation to the said\r\nAlmas Ali, did himself labor to procure from all parts attestations to\r\nprove him not guilty of the perfidy and disloyalty of which the said\r\nHastings himself appears to have been to that very time his sole\r\naccuser, as he hath since been his most anxious advocate: but though he\r\ndid use many endeavors to acquit Almas Ali of his intended flight, yet\r\nconcerning his embezzlements and oppressions, the most important of all\r\ncharges relative to that of the revenue and collection, he, the said\r\nHastings, hath made no inquiry whatever; by which it might appear that\r\nhe was not as fully guilty thereof as he had always represented him to\r\nbe. But some time after he, the said Warren Hastings, had arrived at\r\nLucknow, in the year 1784, he suggested to the said Almas Ali Khân the\r\n_advance_ to the Company's use of a sum of money amounting to fifty\r\nthousand pounds or thereabouts; and the said suggested advance was (as\r\nthe said Warren Hastings asserts, no witness or document of the\r\ntransaction appearing) \"cheerfully and without hesitation complied with,\r\nconsidering it as an _evidence seasonably_ offered for the general\r\nrefutation of the charges of perfidy and disloyalty\": which practice of\r\ncharging wealthy persons with treason and disloyalty, and afterwards\r\nacquitting them on the payment of a sum of money, is highly scandalous\r\nto the honor, justice, and government of Great Britain; and the offence\r\nis highly aggravated by the said Hastings's declaration to the Court of\r\nDirectors that the charges against Almas Ali Khân have been too\r\nlaboriously urged against him, and carried at one time to such an excess\r\nas had nearly driven him to abandon his country \"_for the preservation\r\nof his life and honor_,\" and thus to give a \"color to the charges\r\nthemselves,\" when he, the said Warren Hastings, did well know that he\r\nhimself did consider as a crime, and did make it an article in a formal\r\naccusation against the Resident Middleton, that he did not inform him,\r\nthe said Hastings, of the supposed treasons of Almas Ali Khân, and of\r\nhis design to abandon the country, when he himself did most laboriously\r\nurge the charges against him, and when no attempt appears to have been\r\nmade against the life of the said Almas Ali Khân except by the said\r\nWarren Hastings himself.\r\n\r\nLXXV. That the sum of fifty thousand pounds sterling, or thereabouts,\r\npublicly taken by the said Warren Hastings, as an _advance_ for the use\r\nof the Company, if given as a consideration or fine, on account of the\r\nrenewal for a long term of civil authority and military command, and the\r\ncollection of the revenues to an immense amount, the same being at least\r\neight hundred thousand pounds sterling yearly, was so totally inadequate\r\nto the interest granted, that it may justly be presumed it was not on\r\nthat, or on any public ground or condition, that the said Hastings did\r\ndelegate, out of all reach of resumption or correction, a lease of\r\nboundless power and enormous profit, for so long a term, to a known\r\noppressor of the country.\r\n\r\nLXXVI. That Warren Hastings, being at Lucknow in consequence of his\r\ndeputation aforesaid, did, in his letter from that city, dated 30th of\r\nApril, 1784, recommend to the Court of Directors, \"as his _last and\r\nultimate hope_, that their wisdom would put a _final_ period to _the\r\nruinous and disreputable system_ of interference, whether _avowed or\r\nsecret_, in the affairs of the Nabob of Oude, and withdraw _forever the\r\ninfluence_ by which it is maintained,\" and that they ought to confine\r\ntheir views to the sole maintenance of the old brigade stationed in Oude\r\nby virtue of the first treaty with the reigning Nabob, expressing\r\nhimself in the following words to the Court of Directors. \"If you\r\ntransgress that line, you may extend _the distribution of patronage, and\r\nadd to the fortunes of individuals_, and to the nominal riches of Great\r\nBritain; but your _own_ interests will suffer by it; and _the ruin of a\r\ngreat and once flourishing nation will he recorded as the work of your\r\nadministration, with an everlasting reproach to the British name_. To\r\nthis reasoning I shall join _the obligations of justice and good faith,\r\nwhich cut off every pretext for your exercising any power or authority\r\nin this country, as long as the sovereign of it fulfils the engagements\r\nhe has articled with you_.\"\r\n\r\nLXXVII. That it appears by the extraordinary recommendation aforesaid,\r\nasserted by him, the said Hastings, to be enforced by the\r\n\"_obligations of justice and good faith_,\" that the said Warren\r\nHastings, at the time of writing the said letter, had made an\r\nagreement to withdraw the British interference, represented by him as\r\na \"ruinous and disreputable system,\" out of the dominions of the Nabob\r\nof Oude. But the instrument itself, in which the said agreement is\r\nmade, (if at all existing,) does not appear; nor hath the said\r\nHastings transmitted any documents relative to the said treaty, which\r\nis a neglect highly criminal,--especially as he has informed the\r\nCompany, in his letter from Benares, \"that he has promised the Nabob\r\nthat he will not abandon him to the _chance_ of any other mode of\r\nrelation, and most confidently given him assurance of _the\r\nratification and confirmation_ of that which he [the said Hastings]\r\nhad established between his government and the Company\": the said\r\n_confident assurance_ being given to an agreement never produced, and\r\nmade without any sort of authority from the Court of Directors,--an\r\nagreement precluding, on the one hand, the operation of the discretion\r\nof his masters in the conduct of their affairs, or, on the other,\r\nsubjecting them to the hazard of an imputation on their faith, by\r\nbreaking an engagement confidently made in their name, though without\r\ntheir consent, by the first officer of their government.\r\n\r\nThat the said Hastings, further to preclude the operation of such\r\ndiscretionary conduct in the administration of this kingdom as\r\ncircumstances might call for, has informed the Directors that he has\r\ngone so far as even to condition the existence of the revenue itself\r\nwith the exclusion of the Company, his masters, from all interference\r\nwhatsoever: for in his letter to Mr. Wheler, dated Benares, 20th\r\nSeptember, 1784, are the following words. \"The aumils [collectors]\r\ndemanded that a clause should be inserted in their engagements, that\r\nthey were to be in full force for the complete term of their leases,\r\n_provided that no foreign authority_ was exercised over them,--or, in\r\nother words, _that their engagements were to cease whenever they should\r\nbe interrupted in their functions by the interference of an English\r\nagent_. This requisition was officially notified to me by the acting\r\nminister, and referred to me in form by the Nabob Vizier, for my\r\n_previous_ consent to it. I encouraged it, and I gave my consent to\r\nit.\" And the said Hastings has been guilty of the high presumption to\r\ninform his said masters, that he has taken that course to compel them\r\nnot to violate the assurances given by him in their name: \"There is one\r\ncondition\" (namely, the above condition) \"which _essentially connects\r\nthe confirmation of the settlement itself with the interests of the\r\nCompany_.\"\r\n\r\nLXXVIII. That the said Warren Hastings, who did show an indecent\r\ndistrust of the Company's faith, did endeavor, before that time, at\r\nother times, namely, in his instructions to his secret agent, Major\r\nPalmer, dated the 6th of May, 1782, to limit the confidence to be\r\nreposed in the British government to the duration of his own power, in\r\nthe following words in the fifth article. \"It is very much my desire to\r\nimpress the Nabob with a _thorough_ confidence in the faith and justice\r\nof our government,--that is to say, _in my own_, while I am at the head\r\nof it: I cannot be answerable for the acts of others independent of me.\"\r\n\r\nLXXIX. That the said Warren Hastings did, in his letter, dated Benares,\r\nthe 1st of October, 1784, to the Court of Directors, write, \"that, if\r\nthey [the Directors] manifested no _symptoms_ of an (1.) _intended_\r\ninterference, the objects of his engagements will be obtained; (2.) but\r\nif a different policy shall be adopted,--if new agents are sent into the\r\ncountry, and armed with authority for the purposes of vengeance or\r\ncorruption (_for to no other will they be applied_),--if new demands are\r\nmade on the Nabob Vizier, (4.) and accounts overcharged on one side,\r\nwith a wide latitude taken on the other, to swell his debt beyond the\r\nmeans of payment,--(5.) if political dangers are portended, to ground on\r\nthem the plea of burdening his country with unnecessary defences and\r\nenormous subsidies,--(6.) or if, even abstaining from _direct\r\nencroachment on the Nabob's rights_, your government shall show but _a\r\ndegree of personal kindness to the partisans_ of the late usurpation, or\r\nby any constructive indication of partiality and dissatisfaction\r\n_furnish_ grounds for the _expectation_ of an _approaching_ change of\r\nsystem,--I am sorry to say, that all my labors will prove abortive.\"\r\n\r\nLXXX. That all the measures deprecated in future by the said Warren\r\nHastings, with a reference to former conduct, in his several letters\r\naforesaid, being (so far as the same are intelligible) six in number,\r\nhave been all of them the proper acts and measures of the said Warren\r\nHastings himself. For he did himself first of all introduce, and did\r\nafterwards continue and support, that interference which he now informs\r\nthe Court of Directors \"is ruinous and disreputable, and which the very\r\n_symptoms_ of an _intention_ to renew\" he considers in the highest\r\ndegree dangerous; he did direct, with a controlling and absolute\r\nauthority, in every department of government, and in every district in\r\nthe dominions of the Nabob of Oude. Secondly, the appointment of agents,\r\nwhich was eminently the act of his own administration: he not only\r\nretaining many agents in the country of Oude, both \"_secret and\r\navowed_,\" but also sending some of them, in defiance to the orders of\r\nthat very Court of Directors, to whom, in his said letter of the 1st of\r\nOctober, 1784, he assigns \"vengeance and corruption\" as the only motives\r\nthat can produce such appointments. Thirdly, that he, the said Warren\r\nHastings, did instruct one of the said agents, and did charge him upon\r\npain of \"_a dreadful responsibility_,\" to perform sundry acts of\r\nviolence against persons of the highest distinction and nearest relation\r\nto the prince; which acts were justly liable to the imputation of\r\n\"_vengeance_\" in the execution, and which he, in his reply to the\r\ndefence of Middleton to one of his charges, did declare to be liable to\r\nthe suspicion of \"_corruption_ in the relaxation.\" Fourthly, that he did\r\nraise new demands on the Vizier, \"and overcharge accounts on one side\r\nand take a wide latitude on the other,\" by sending up a new and before\r\nunheard-of overcharge of four hundred thousand pounds and upwards, not\r\nmade by the Resident or admitted by the Vizier, and, by adding the same,\r\ndid swell his debt \"beyond the means of payment\"; and did even insert,\r\nas the ninth article of his charge against Middleton, \"his omitting to\r\ntake any notice of the additional balance of Rupees 26,48,571, stated by\r\nthe Accountant-General to be due from the Vizier on the 30th of April,\r\n1780,\" to which he did add fourteen lac more, making together the above\r\nsum. Fifthly, that he, the said Warren Hastings, did assign \"political\r\ndangers,\" in his minute of the 13th December, 1779, for burdening the\r\nsaid Nabob of Oude \"with unnecessary defences and enormous subsidies,\"\r\nwith regard to which he then declared, that \"it was _our_ part, not\r\n_his_ [the Nabob's], to judge and to determine.\" And, sixthly, that he\r\ndid not only show the _design_, but the _fact_, of personal kindness to\r\nthe partisans of what he here calls, as well as in another letter, and\r\nin one Minute of Consultation, a \"late usurpation,\"--he having rewarded\r\nthe principal and most obnoxious of the instruments of the said late\r\nusurpation, (if such it was,) Richard Johnson, Esquire, with an\r\nhonorable and profitable embassy to the court of the Nizam.\r\n\r\nLXXXI. That the said Warren Hastings, therefore,--by assuming an\r\nauthority which he himself did consider as an _usurpation_, and by acts\r\nin virtue of that usurped authority, done in his own proper person and\r\nby agents appointed by himself, and proceeding (though with some\r\nmitigation, for which one of them was by him censured and accused) under\r\nhis own express and positive orders and instructions, and thereby\r\nestablishing, as he himself observed, \"a system of interference,\r\ndisreputable and ruinous, which could only be subservient to promote\r\npatronage, private interest, private embezzlement, corruption, and\r\nvengeance,\" to the public detriment of the Company, \"and to the ruin of\r\na once flourishing nation, and eternally reproachful to the British\r\nname,\" and for the evil effects of which system, \"as his sole and\r\nultimate hope\" and remedy, he recommends an entire abdication, forever,\r\nnot only of all power and authority, but even of the interference and\r\ninfluence of Great Britain,--is guilty of an high crime and misdemeanor.\r\n\r\nLXXXII. That the said Warren Hastings, in his letter from Chunar of the\r\n29th of November, 1781, has represented that very influence and\r\ninterference, which in three public papers he denominates \"_a late\r\nusurpation_\" as being authorized by a regular treaty and agreement,\r\nvoluntarily made with the Nabob himself, at a place called Chunar, on\r\nthe 19th of September, 1781, a copy of which hath been transmitted to\r\nthe Court of Directors,--and that three persons were present at the\r\nexecution of the same, two whereof were Middleton and Johnson, his\r\nagents and Residents at Oude, the third the minister of the Nabob. And\r\nhe did, in his paper written to the Council-General, and transmitted to\r\nthe Court of Directors, not only declare that the said interference was\r\nagreed to by the said Nabob, and sealed with his seal, but would be\r\nhighly beneficial to him: assuring the said Council, \"that, if the\r\nResident performed his duty in the execution of his [the said\r\nHastings's] instructions, the Nabob's part of the engagement will prove\r\nof still greater benefit to him than to our government, in whose behalf\r\nit was exacted; and that the _participation_ which is allowed our\r\nResident in the _inspection_ of the public treasure will secure the\r\nreceipt of the Company's demands, whilst _the influence which our\r\ngovernment will ALWAYS possess over the public minister of the Nabob,\r\nand the authority of our own_, will be an effectual means of securing an\r\nattentive and faithful discharge of their several trusts, both towards\r\nthe Company and the Vizier.\"\r\n\r\nLXXXIII. And the said Warren Hastings did not only settle a plan, of\r\nwhich the agency and interference aforesaid was a part, and assert the\r\nbeneficial consequences thereof, but did also record, that the same \"was\r\na great public measure, constituted on a large and _established system_,\r\nand destructive, in its instant effects, of the interest and fortune of\r\nmany patronized individuals\"; and in consequence of the said treaty, he,\r\nthe said Warren Hastings, did authorize and positively require his agent\r\naforesaid to interfere in and control and regulate _all the Nabob's\r\naffairs whatsoever_: and the said Warren Hastings having made for the\r\nCompany, and in its name, an acquisition of power and authority, even if\r\nit had been abused by others, he ought to have remedied the abuse, and\r\nbrought the guilty to condign punishment, instead of making another\r\ntreaty without their approbation, consent, or knowledge, and to this\r\ntime not communicated to them, by which it appears he has annulled the\r\nformer treaty, and the authority thereby acquired to the Company, as a\r\ngrievance and usurpation, to which, from the general corruption of their\r\nservice, no other remedy could be applied than a formal renunciation of\r\ntheir power and influence: for which said actings and doings the said\r\nWarren Hastings is guilty of an high crime and misdemeanor.\r\n\r\nLXXXIV. That the Company's army in India is an object requiring the most\r\nvigilant and constant inspection, both to the happiness of the natives,\r\nthe security of the British power, and to its own obedience and\r\ndiscipline, and does require that inspection in proportion as it is\r\nremoved from the principal seat of government; and the number and\r\ndiscipline of the troops kept up by the native princes, along with\r\nBritish troops, is also of great moment and importance to the same ends.\r\nThat Warren Hastings, Esquire, pretending to pursue the same, did, in\r\nvirtue of an authority acquired by the treaty of Chunar aforesaid, give\r\nstrict orders, and to which he did demand _a most implicit obedience_,\r\nthat _all_ officers of the Nabob's army should be appointed \"with _the\r\nconcurrence of the Resident_,\" and supposing the case that persons of\r\nobnoxious description or of known disaffection to the British government\r\nshould be appointed, (of which he left the Resident to be the judge,)\r\nhe did direct in the following words: \"You are in such case to\r\nremonstrate against it; and if the Vizier should persist in his choice,\r\nyou are peremptorily, _and in my name_, to oppose it as _a breach of his\r\nagreement_\"; and he did also direct that the \"_mootiana_ [or soldiers\r\nemployed for the collection of revenue] should be reformed, and reduced\r\ninto one corps for the whole service, and that _no_ infantry should be\r\nleft in the Nabob's service but what may be necessary for his\r\nbodyguard\"; and he did further order and direct as follows: \"That in\r\nquelling disturbances the commander of the forces should assist you [the\r\nsaid Resident] on the requisition of the Vizier communicated through you\r\nto him [the said commander], _or at your own tingle application_. It is\r\ndirected that the regiment ordered for the immediate protection of your\r\noffice and person at Lucknow shall be relieved every three months, and\r\nduring its stay there shall act solely and exclusively under your\r\norders.\" And it appears in the course of the Company's correspondence,\r\nthat the country troops under the Nabob's sole direction would be\r\nill-disciplined and unserviceable, if not worse, and therefore the said\r\nWarren Hastings did order that \"no infantry should be kept in his\r\nservice\"; yet it appears that the said Warren Hastings did make an\r\narrangement for a body of native troops wholly out of the control or\r\ninspection of the British government, and left a written order in the\r\nhands of Major Palmer (one of _his_ agents, who had been continued\r\nthere, though the Company was not permitted to employ any) to be\r\ntransmitted to Colonel Cumming as soon as an adequate force shall be\r\nprovided _for the defence of the Nabob's frontier_ by detachments from\r\n_the Nabob's own battalions_,--the said Colonel Cumming's forces, whom\r\nthe others were to supersede and replace, consisting wholly of infantry,\r\nand which, being intended for the same service, were probably of the\r\nsame constitution.\r\n\r\nLXXXV. That the old brigade of British troops, which by treaty was to\r\nremain, had been directed, by the instructions of the said Hastings to\r\nthe Resident Middleton and to the Resident Bristow, \"not to be employed\r\nat the requisition of the Vizier any otherwise than through the\r\nResident\"; and the said direction was properly given,--it not being fit\r\nthat British troops should be under the sole direction of foreign\r\nindependent princes, or of any other than the British government: yet,\r\nnotwithstanding the proper and necessary direction aforesaid, he, the\r\nsaid Warren Hastings, hath left the said troops, by his new treaty,\r\nwithout any local control, or even inspection, notwithstanding his\r\npowers under the treaty of Chunar, and his own repeated orders, and\r\nnotwithstanding the mischiefs and dangers which the said Warren Hastings\r\ndid foresee would result therefrom, if left under the sole direction of\r\nthe Nabob, and their own discretion, the said Hastings having stipulated\r\nwith the said Nabob not to exercise any authority, or even influence,\r\n_secret_ or _avowed_, within his dominions.\r\n\r\nLXXXVI. That the crime of the said Warren Hastings, in attempting thus\r\nto abandon the British army to the sole discretion of the Nabob of Oude,\r\nis exceedingly aggravated by the description given by him severally of\r\nthe said Nabob of Oude, and of the British army stationed for the\r\ndefence of his dominions. In his letters to the Court of Directors, and\r\nin his Minutes of Consultation, and particularly in his letter of ----,\r\nimmediately on the accession of the Nabob, he did inform the said Court,\r\n\"that the Nabob had not, by all accounts, the qualities of the head or\r\nheart which fitted him for that office, though there was no dispute\r\nconcerning his right to succeed\"; and some years afterwards, when his\r\naccounts must have been rendered more certain, he did, in his Minute of\r\nConsultation of the 15th of December, 1779, (regularly transmitted to\r\nthe Court of Directors,) upon a discussion for withdrawing certain\r\ntroops kept up in the Nabob's country without his consent, by him, the\r\nsaid Warren Hastings, strongly urge as follows,--\"the _necessity_ of\r\nmaintaining the influence and force which we possess in the country;\r\nthat the disorders of his state [the Nabob of Oude's state] and\r\ndissipation of his revenues are the effects of his own conduct, which\r\nhas failed, not so much from the usual effects of _incapacity_ as from\r\nthe detestable choice he has made of the ministers of his power and the\r\nparticipation of his confidence. I forbear to expatiate further on his\r\ncharacter; it is sufficient that I am understood by the members of this\r\nboard, who must know the truth of my allusions. Mr. Francis\" (a member\r\nof the board) \"surely was not aware of the injury he did me [Warren\r\nHastings] by attributing to the spirit of party the character I gave\r\nAsoph ul Dowlah [the Nabob of Oude]; he himself knows it _to be true;\r\nand it is one of those notorieties which supersede the necessity of any\r\nevidence. I was forced to the allusion I made by the imputation cast on\r\nthis government, as having caused the evils which prevail in the\r\ngovernment of the Nabob of Oude, which I could only answer by ascribing\r\nthem to their true cause, the character and conduct of the Nabob of\r\nOude.\"_ And the Resident (appointed by the said Hastings, against the\r\norders of the Court of Directors, as his particular confidential\r\nrepresentative, one whom the said Nabob did himself request might be\r\ncontinued with him _by an engagement in writing forever_) did some time\r\nbefore, that is, on the 3d of January, 1779, assure the said Hastings\r\nand the Council-General, that \"such is his Excellency's [the Nabob of\r\nOude's] disposition, and so entirely has he lost the confidence and\r\naffections of his subjects, that, unless some restraint is imposed on\r\nhim which would effectually secure those who live under the protection\r\nof his government from violence and oppression, I am but too well\r\nconvinced that no man of reputation or property will long continue in\r\nthese provinces\"; and that the said Resident proceeds to an instance of\r\noppression and rapine, \"out of _many_ of the Nabob's, which has caused a\r\ntotal disaffection and want of confidence among his subjects: he hoped\r\nthe board would take it into their humane consideration, and interpose\r\ntheir _influence_, and prevent an act which would inevitably bring\r\ndisgrace upon himself, and a proportionable degree of discredit on the\r\nnational character of the English, which I consider to be more or less\r\nconcerned in every act of his administration.\"\r\n\r\nLXXXVII. That no exception was ever taken by the said Warren Hastings to\r\nthe truth of the facts, or to the justness of the observation of the\r\nsaid Resident, which he did transmit to the Court of Directors. And the\r\nsaid Warren Hastings, in his letter from Chunar, dated the 29th of\r\nNovember, 1781, speaking of the restraints which had been put by him,\r\nthe said Hastings, on the Nabob, relative to his own _mootiana_, or\r\nforces for collection and police, and the necessity of giving the\r\nResident a control in the nomination of the officers of his army, has\r\nasserted, \"that the necessity of the reservation arose from a too well\r\nknown defect in the Nabob's character: if this _check_ be withdrawn, and\r\nthe choice left absolutely to the Nabob, the first commands in his army\r\nwill be filled with the most worthless and abandoned of his subjects:\r\nhis late commander-in-chief is a signal and scandalous instance of\r\nthis.\"\r\n\r\nLXXXVIII. And the said Warren Hastings, in his letter to the Court of\r\nDirectors, dated Benares, the 15th of October, 1784, even after he had\r\nmade the aforesaid renunciation of the Company's authority and influence\r\nto the Nabob, did write, \"that the Nabob, though most gentle in his\r\nmanners, and endued with an understanding much above the common level,\r\nhas been _unfortunately bred up in habits_ that draw his attention too\r\nmuch from his own affairs, and often subject him to the guidance of\r\n_insidious and unworthy confidants_\"; which, though more decently\r\nexpressed with regard to the Nabob than in his former minutes,\r\nsubstantially agrees with them. And the said Warren Hastings did inform\r\nthe Court of Directors, after he had solemnly covenanted to withdraw all\r\nthe Company's influence on the assurances and promises of a person so by\r\nhimself described, that, for reasons grounded on his knowledge of the\r\nimbecility of the character of the Nabob, he waited in a frontier town,\r\n\"that he might be at hand to counteract any attempt to defeat the effect\r\nof his proceedings at Lucknow\"; and in his letter to Mr. Wheler from the\r\nsame place he did write in the following words: \"I am still near enough\r\nto attend to the first effects of the execution, and to interfere with\r\nmy influence for the removal of any obstructions to which they are or\r\nmay be liable.\" He therefore found that there was none or but an\r\ninsufficient security to the effect of his treaty, but in his own direct\r\npersonal violation of it. What otherwise was wanting in the security for\r\nthe Nabob's engagements was to be supplied as follows: \"The most\r\nrespectable persons of his family will be employed to counteract every\r\nother which may tend to warp him from it; and I am sorry to say _that\r\nsuch assistance was wanting_.\" And in another letter, \"that he had equal\r\nground to expect every degree of support which could be given it by _the\r\nfirst characters of his family_, who are warmly and zealously interested\r\nin it\": the principal male character of the family, and of the most\r\ninfluence in that family, being Salar Jung, uncle to the Nabob; and the\r\nfirst female characters of the family being the mother and grandmother\r\nof the reigning sovereign: all of whom, male and female, he, the said\r\nWarren Hastings, in sundry letters of his own, in the transmission of\r\nvarious official documents, and even in affidavits studiously collected\r\nand sworn before Sir Elijah Impey during his short residence at Lucknow\r\nand Benares, did himself represent as persons entirely disaffected to\r\nthe English power in India,--as having been principal promoters, if not\r\noriginal contrivers, of a general rebellion and revolt for the utter\r\nextirpation of the English nation,--and as such, he, the said Warren\r\nHastings, did compel the Nabob reluctantly to take from them their\r\nlanded estates; and yet the said Warren Hastings has had the presumption\r\nto attempt to impose on the East India Company by pretending to place\r\nhis reliance on those three persons for a settlement favorable to the\r\nCompany's interests, on his renunciation of all their own power,\r\nauthority, and influence, and on his leaving their army to the sole and\r\nuncontrolled discretion of a stranger, meriting in his opinion the\r\ndescription given by him as aforesaid, as well as by him frequently\r\nasserted to be politically incapable of supporting his own power without\r\nthe aid of the forces of the Company. And the offence of the said Warren\r\nHastings, in abandoning a considerable part of the British army in the\r\nmanner aforesaid, is much increased by the description which he has\r\nhimself given of the state of the said army, and particularly of that\r\npart thereof which is stationed in the Nabob of Oude's dominions: for he\r\ndid himself, on the 29th of November, 1781, transmit the information\r\nfollowing, on that subject, to the Court of Directors, namely,--\"that\r\nthe remote stations of those troops, placing the commanding officers\r\nbeyond the notice and control of the board [the Council-General] at\r\nCalcutta, afforded too much of opportunity and temptation for\r\nunwarrantable _emoluments, and excited the contagion of peculation and\r\nrapacity throughout the whole army_. A most remarkable instance and\r\nuncontrovertible proof of the prevalence of this spirit has been seen in\r\nthe court-martial upon Captain Erskine, where the court, composed of\r\nofficers of rank, and respectable characters, unanimously and honorably,\r\n(_most_ honorably,) upon an acknowledged fact, acquitted him, which in\r\ntimes of stricter discipline would have been deemed a crime deserving\r\nthe severest punishment.\" From which representation (if the said Warren\r\nHastings did not falsely and unjustly accuse and slander the Company's\r\nservice) it appeared that the peculation which infected the whole army,\r\nderived from the taint which it had in Oude, and so fatal to the\r\ndiscipline of the troops, would be dangerously increased by his treaty\r\nand agreement aforesaid with the Nabob, and by his own said evil counsel\r\nto the Court of Directors.\r\n\r\nLXXXIX. That it appears, after the said Warren Hastings had, on grounds\r\nso disgraceful to the British nation and government, agreed to remove\r\nforever the British influence and interference from the government of\r\nOude, on account of the disorders in the said government, solely\r\nproduced by his own criminal acts and criminal connivances, that he did\r\noverturn his own settlement as soon as he had made it, and did, after he\r\nhad abolished the Company's Residency, as a grievance, wholly violate\r\nhis own solemn agreement: for he did, for his private purposes, continue\r\ntherein his own private agent, Major Palmer, with a number of officers\r\nand pensioners, at a charge to the revenues of the country greatly\r\nexceeding that of the establishment under Mr. Bristow, which he did\r\nrepresent as frightfully enormous, and which he pretended to remove: the\r\nformer amounting to 112,950_l._, the latter only to 64,202_l._\r\n\r\nXC. That his own secret agent, Major Palmer, did receive a salary or\r\nallowance, equal to 22,800_l._ a year, out of the distressed province\r\nof Oude; and this the said Palmer did declare not to be more than he\r\nabsolutely did really and _bonâ fide_ spend, and that he had\r\nretrenched considerably \"in some of the articles since the expense has\r\nbeen borne by the Vizier, and in every particular he made as little\r\nparade and appearance as his station would admit,\"--his station being\r\nthat of the said Warren Hastings's private agent. But if the said\r\nlarge salary must be considered as merely equal to the expenses, large\r\nsecret emoluments must be presumed to attend it, in order to make it a\r\nplace advantageous to the holder thereof. That the said Palmer did\r\napply to the board at Calcutta for a new authority to continue the\r\nsaid establishments,--he conceiving their continuance, \"after the\r\nperiod of the Governor-General's departure, depended upon the pleasure\r\nof the board, and not upon the _authority of the Governor-General,\r\nunder the sanction of which they were established or confirmed_.\"\r\n\r\nXCI. That the said Warren Hastings, in order to ruin the Resident\r\nBristow, and to justify himself for his former proceedings respecting\r\nhim, did bring before the board a new charge against him, for having\r\npaid a large establishment of offices and pensions to the Company's\r\nservants from the revenues of Oude; and the said Bristow, in making his\r\ndefence against the charge aforesaid, did plead, that he had found all\r\nthe allowances on his list established before his last appointment to\r\nthe Residency,--that they had grown to that excess in the interval\r\nbetween his first removal by the said Warren Hastings and his\r\nreappointment; and having adduced many reasons to make it highly\r\nprobable that the said Hastings was perfectly well acquainted with it,\r\nand did approve of the expensive establishments which he, the said\r\nBristow, simply had paid, but not imposed, he did allege, besides the\r\nofficial assurances of his predecessor, Middleton, certain facts, as\r\namounting to a direct proof that the Governor-General, Warren Hastings,\r\nwas not averse to the Vizier's granting large salaries to more than one\r\nEuropean gentleman. And the first instance was to Mr. Thomas, a surgeon,\r\nwho, exclusive of his pay from the Company, which was 1,440_l._ a year,\r\nclaimed from the Vizier, with Mr. Hastings's knowledge, the sum of\r\n9,763_l._ a year, and upwards, making together 11,203_l._ per annum. The\r\nnext was Mr. Trevor Wheler, who did receive, upon the same\r\nestablishment, when he was Fourth Assistant at Oude, 6,000_l._ a year;\r\nand which last fact the said Hastings has admitted upon record \"that the\r\naccusations of Mr. Bristow and Mr. Cowper did _oblige_ and _compel_ him\r\nto acknowledge,\"--denying, at the same time, that the allowances of the\r\nResidents Middleton and Bristow, except in this single instance, were\r\never authorized by him; whereas his own agent, Palmer, did, in his\r\nletter of the 27th of March, 1785, represent, that the said salaries and\r\nallowances (if not more and larger) were by him authorized or confirmed.\r\n\r\nXCII. That the aforesaid Bristow did also produce the following letter\r\nin proof that Mr. Hastings knew and approved of large salaries to\r\nBritish subjects upon the revenues of Oude, and which he did declare\r\nthat nothing but the necessity of self-defence could have induced him to\r\nproduce.\r\n\r\n'DEAR BRISTOW,--\r\n\r\n\"Sir Eyre Coote has some field-allowances to receive from the Vizier;\r\nthey amount to Sicca Rupees 15,554 per month, and he has been paid up by\r\nthe Vizier to the 20th of August, 1782. The Governor has directed me to\r\nwrite to you, to request you to receive what is due from the Vizier\r\nfrom the 20th August last, at the rate of Lucknow Sicca Rupees 15,664\r\nper month, and send me a bill for the amount, the receipt of which I\r\nwill acknowledge in the capacity of Sir Eyre Coote's attorney; and the\r\nGovernor desires that you will continue to receive Sir Eyre Coote's\r\nfield-allowances at the same rate, and remit the money to me as it comes\r\nin.\r\n\r\n     (Signed)                 \"CHARLES CROFTES.\r\n\r\n  \"CALCUTTA, January 25, 1783.\"\r\n\r\nXCIII. That Sir Eyre Coote aforesaid was at the time of the said\r\nfield-allowances not serving in the country of Oude, on which the said\r\nallowances were charged, but in the Carnatic.\r\n\r\nXCIV. That, from the declaration of the said Hastings himself, that it\r\nwas the conviction of Mr. Bristow and Mr. Cowper that could alone\r\n_oblige_ and _compel_ him to _acknowledge_ certain of his aforesaid\r\npractices, and that nothing _but the necessity of self-defence_ could\r\nhave induced Mr. Bristow to make public another and much stronger\r\ninstance of the same, it is to be violently presumed, that, where these\r\ntwo, or either, or both necessities did not exist, many evil and\r\noppressive practices of the said Hastings do remain undiscovered,--that,\r\nif it had not been for the contests between him, the said Hastings, and\r\nthe Resident Bristow, not only the before-mentioned particulars, but the\r\nwhole of the expensive civil establishments for English servants at\r\nOude, would have been forever concealed from the Directors and from\r\nParliament: and yet the said Hastings has had the audacity to pretend so\r\ncomplete an ignorance of the facts, that, representing the Vizier as\r\nobjecting to the largeness of the payments made by Bristow, and stating\r\na very reduced list, which he was willing to allow for, amounting to\r\n30,000_l._ a year, the said Hastings did affect to be alarmed at the\r\nmagnitude even of the list so curtailed, expressing himself as follows,\r\nin his minute of the 7th of December, 1784: \"For my own part, when the\r\nVizier's minister first informed me that the amount which his master had\r\nauthorized, and was willing to admit, for the charges of the Residency,\r\nand the allowances of the gentlemen at Lucknow, was 25,000 rupees per\r\nmonth, I own I was startled at the magnitude of the sum, and was some\r\ndays hesitating in my mind whether I could with propriety admit of it\":\r\nwhereas he well knew that the three sums alone of which the necessities\r\naforesaid had compelled the discovery did greatly exceed that sum of\r\nwhich at the first hearing he affects to have been so exceedingly\r\nalarmed and thrown into a state of hesitation which continued for some\r\ndays, and although he, the said Hastings, was conscious that he had at\r\nthe very time authorized an establishment to more than four times the\r\namount thereof.\r\n\r\nXCV. That, in the said deceits, prevarications, contradictions,\r\nmalicious accusations, fraudulent concealments, and compelled\r\ndiscoveries, as well as in the said secret, corrupt, and prodigal\r\ndisposition of the revenues of Oude, as well as in his breach of faith\r\nto the Nabob, in continuing expensive establishments under a private\r\nagent of his own after he had agreed to remove the Company's agent, the\r\nsaid Warren Hastings is guilty of an high offence and misdemeanor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII.--MAHOMED REZA KHÂN.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. That it was the declared policy of the Company, on the acquisition of\r\nthe dewanny of Bengal, to continue the country government, under the\r\ninspection of the Resident at the Nabob's durbar in the first instance,\r\nand that of the President and Council in the last; and for that purpose\r\nthey did stipulate to assign, for the support of the dignity of the\r\nNabob, an annual allowance from the revenues, equal to four hundred\r\nthousand pounds a year.\r\n\r\nII. That, during the country government, the principal active person in\r\nthe administration of affairs, for rank, and for reputation of probity,\r\nand of knowledge in the revenues and the laws, was Mahomed Reza Khân,\r\nwho, besides large landed property, was possessed of offices whose\r\nemoluments amounted nearly, if not altogether, to one hundred thousand\r\npounds a year.\r\n\r\nIV.[16] That the Company's servants, in the beginning, were not\r\nconversant in the affairs of the revenue, and stood in need of natives\r\nof integrity and experience to act in the management thereof. On that\r\nground, as well as in regard to the rank which Mahomed Reza Khân held in\r\nthe country, and the confidence of the people in him, they, the\r\nPresident and Council, did inform the Court of Directors, in their\r\nletter of the 30th of September, 1765, that, \"as Mahomed Reza Khân's\r\nshort administration was irreproachable, they determined to continue him\r\nin a share of the authority\"; and this information was not given\r\nlightly, but was founded upon an inquiry into his conduct, and a minute\r\nexamination of charges made against him by his rivals in the Nabob's\r\ncourt,--they having insinuated to the Nabob that a design was formed for\r\ndeposing him, and placing Mahomed Reza on his throne; but, on\r\nexamination, the President and Council declare, that \"he had so openly\r\nand candidly accounted _for every rupee_ disbursed from the treasury,\r\nthat they could not, without injury to his character, and injustice to\r\nhis conduct during his short administration, refuse continuing him in a\r\nshare of the government.\"\r\n\r\nV. That the Company had reason to be satisfied with the arrangement\r\nmade, so far as it regarded him: the President and Council having\r\ninformed them, in the following year, in their letter of the 9th of\r\nDecember, 1766, that \"the _large_ increase of the revenue must in a\r\ngreat measure be ascribed to Mr. Sykes's assiduity, and to _Mahomed Reza\r\nKhân's profound knowledge in the finances_.\"\r\n\r\nVI. That the then President and Council, finding it necessary to make\r\nseveral reforms in the administration, were principally aided in the\r\nsame by the suggestion, advice, and assistance of the said Mahomed Reza\r\nKhân; and in their letter to the Court of Directors of the 24th of June,\r\n1767, they state their resolution of reducing the emoluments of office,\r\nwhich before had arisen from a variety of presents and other\r\nperquisities, to fixed allowances; and they state the merits of Mahomed\r\nReza Khân therein, as well as the importance, dignity, and\r\nresponsibility of his station, in the following manner.\r\n\r\n\"Mahomed Reza Khân has now _of himself, with great delicacy of honor_,\r\nrepresented to us the evil consequences that must ensue from the\r\ncontinuance of this practice,--since, by suffering the principal\r\nofficers of the government to depend for the support of their dignity on\r\nthe precarious fund of perquisites, they in a manner oblige them to\r\npursue oppressive and corrupt measures, equally injurious to the country\r\nand the Company; and they accordingly assigned twelve lac of rupees for\r\nthe maintenance and support of the said Mahomed Reza Khân, and two other\r\nprincipal persons, who held in their hands the most important\r\nemployments of that government,--having regard to their elevated\r\nstations, and to the expediency of supporting them in all the show and\r\nparade requisite to keep up the authority and influence of their\r\nrespective offices, as they are all men of weight and consideration in\r\nthe country, who held places of great trust and profit under the former\r\ngovernment. We further propose, by this act of generosity, to engage\r\ntheir cordial services, and confirm them steady in our interests; since\r\nthey cannot hope, from the most successful ambition, to rise to greater\r\nadvantages by any chance or revolution of affairs. At the same time it\r\nwas reasonable we should not lose sight of Mahomed Reza Khân's past\r\nservices. He has pursued the Company's interest with steadiness and\r\ndiligence; his abilities qualify him to perform the most important\r\nservices; the unavoidable charges of his particular situation are great;\r\nin dignity he stands second to the Nabob only;--and as he engages to\r\nincrease the revenues, without injustice or oppression, to more than the\r\namount of his salary, _and to relinquish those advantages, to the amount\r\nof eight lacs of rupees per annum_, which he heretofore enjoyed, we\r\nthought it proper, in the distribution of salaries, to consider Mahomed\r\nReza Khân in a light superior to the other ministers. We have only to\r\nobserve further, that, great and enormous as the sum must appear which\r\nwe have allotted for the support of the ministers of the government, we\r\nwill not hesitate to pronounce that it is necessary and reasonable, and\r\nwill appear so on the consideration of the power which men employed on\r\nthese important services have either to obstruct or promote the public\r\ngood, unless their integrity be confirmed by the ties of gratitude and\r\ninterest.\"\r\n\r\nVII. That the said Mahomed Reza Khân continued, with the same diligence,\r\nspirit, and fidelity, to execute the trust reposed in him, which\r\ncomprehended a large proportion of the weight of government, and\r\nparticularly of the collections; and his attachment to the interest of\r\nthe Company, and his extensive knowledge, were again, in the course of\r\nthe year 1767, fully acknowledged, and stated to the Court of Directors.\r\nAnd it further appears that by an incessant application to business his\r\nhealth was considerably impaired, which gave occasion in the year\r\nfollowing, that is, in February, 1768, to a fresh acknowledgment of his\r\nservices in these terms: \"We must, in justice to Mahomed Reza Khân,\r\nexpress the high sense we entertain of his abilities, and of the\r\nindefatigable attention he has shown in the execution of the important\r\ntrust reposed in him; and we cannot but lament the prospect of losing\r\nhis services from the present declining state of his health.\"\r\n\r\nVIII. That as in the increase of the revenue the said Mahomed Reza Khân\r\nwas employed as a person likely to improve the same without detriment to\r\nthe people, so, when the state of any province seemed to require a\r\nremission, he was employed as a person disposed to the relief of the\r\npeople without fraud to the revenue; and this was expressed by the\r\nPresident and Council as follows, with relation to the remissions\r\ngranted in the province of Bahar: \"That the general knowledge of Mahomed\r\nReza Khân, in all matters relative to the dewanny revenues, induced us\r\nto consent to such deductions being made from the general state of that\r\nprovince at the _last poonah_ as may be deemed irrecoverable, or such as\r\nmay procure an immediate relief and encouragement to the ryots in the\r\nfuture cultivation of their lands.\"\r\n\r\nIX. That the said Mahomed Reza Khân, in the execution of the said great\r\nand important trusts and powers, was not so much as suspected of an\r\nambitious or encroaching spirit, which might make him dangerous to the\r\nCompany's then recent authority, or which might render his precedence\r\ninjurious to the consideration due to his colleagues in office; but, on\r\nthe contrary, it appears, that, a plan having been adopted for dividing\r\nthe administration, in order to remove the Nabob's jealousies, the same\r\nwas in danger of being subverted by the ambition \"of two of his\r\ncolleagues, and _the excessive moderation of Mahomed Reza Khân_.\" And\r\nfor a remedy of the inconveniencies which might arise from the excess of\r\nan accommodating temper, though attended with irreproachable integrity,\r\nthe President and Council did send one of their own members, as their\r\ndeputy, to the Nabob of Bengal, at his capital of Moorshedabad; and this\r\nmeasure appears to have been adopted for the support of Mahomed Reza\r\nKhân, in consequence of an inquiry made and advice given by Lord Clive,\r\nin his letter of the 3d of July, 1765, in which letter he expresses\r\nhimself of the said Mahomed Reza Khân as follows: \"It is with pleasure I\r\ncan acquaint you, _that, the more I see of Mahomed Reza Khân, the\r\nstronger is my conviction of his honor and moderation_, but that, at the\r\nsame time, I cannot help observing, that, either from timidity or an\r\nerroneous principle, he is too ready to submit to encroachments upon\r\nthat proportion of power that has been allotted him.\"\r\n\r\nX. That, the Nabob Jaffier Ali Khân dying in February, 1765, Mahomed\r\nReza Khân was appointed guardian to his children, and administrator of\r\nhis office, or regent, which appointment the Court of Directors did\r\napprove. But the party opposite to Mahomed Reza Khân having continued to\r\ncabal against him, sundry accusations were framed relative to oppression\r\nat the time of the famine, and for a balance due during his employment\r\nof collector of the revenues; upon which the Directors did order him to\r\nbe deprived of his office, and a strict inquiry to be made into his\r\nconduct.\r\n\r\nXI. That the said Warren Hastings, then lately appointed to the\r\nPresidency, did, on the 1st of April, and on the 24th of September,\r\n1772, write letters to the Court of Directors, informing them that on\r\nthe very next day after he had received (as he asserts) their private\r\norders, \"addressed to himself alone,\" and not to the board, he did\r\ndispatch, by express messengers, his orders to Mr. Middleton, the\r\nResident at the Nabob's court at Moorshedabad, in a public character\r\nand trust with the Nabob, to arrest, in his capital, and at his court,\r\nand without any previous notice given of any charge, his principal\r\nminister, the aforesaid Mahomed Reza Khân, and to bring him down to\r\nCalcutta; and he did carefully conceal his said proceedings from the\r\nknowledge of the board, on pretext of his not being acquainted with\r\ntheir dispositions, and the influence which he thought that the said\r\nMahomed Reza Khân had amongst them.\r\n\r\nXII. That the said Warren Hastings, at the time he gave his orders as\r\naforesaid for arresting the said Mahomed Reza Khân, did not take any\r\nmeasures to compel the appearance of any other persons as\r\nwitnesses,--declaring it as his opinion, \"that there would be little\r\nneed of violence to obtain such intelligence as they could give against\r\ntheir former master, when his authority is taken from him\"; but he did\r\nafterwards, in excuse for the long detention and imprisonment of the\r\nsaid Mahomed Reza Khân, without any proofs having been obtained of his\r\nguilt, or measures taken to bring him to a trial, assure the Directors,\r\nin direct contradiction to his former declaration, \"that the influence\r\nof Mahomed Reza Khân still prevailed generally throughout the country,\r\nin the Nabob's household, and at the capital, and was scarcely affected\r\nby his present disgrace,\"--notwithstanding, as he, the said Hastings,\r\ndoth confess, he had used his utmost endeavors \"to break that influence,\r\nby removing his dependants, and putting the direction of all the affairs\r\nthat had been committed to his care into the hands of _the most powerful\r\nor active of his enemies_; that he depended on the activity of their\r\nhatred to Mahomed Reza Khân, incited by the expectation of rewards, for\r\ninvestigating the conduct of the latter; that with this the institution\r\nof the new dewanny coincided; and that the same principle had guided him\r\nin the choice of Munny Begum and Rajah Gourdas,--the former for the\r\nchief administration, the latter\" (the son of Nundcomar, and a mere\r\ninstrument in the hands of his father) \"for the dewanny of the Nabob's\r\nhousehold,--both _the declared enemies_ of Mahomed Reza Khân.\"\r\n\r\nXIII. That, although it might be true that enemies will become the most\r\nactive prosecutors, and as such may, though under much guard and many\r\nprecautions, be used even as witnesses, and that it ought not to be an\r\nexception, supposing their character and capacity otherwise good, to the\r\nappointing them to power, yet to advance persons to power on the ground\r\nnot of their honor and integrity, which might have produced the enmity\r\nof bad men, but merely for the enmity itself, without any reference\r\nwhatsoever to a laudable cause, and even with a declared ill opinion of\r\nthe morals of one of the party, such as was actually delivered in the\r\nsaid letter by him, the said Hastings, of Nundcomar, (and which time has\r\nshown he might also on good ground have conceived of others,) was, in\r\nthe circumstances of a criminal inquiry, a motive highly disgraceful to\r\nthe honor of government, and destructive of impartial justice, by\r\nholding out the greatest of all possible temptation to false accusation,\r\nto corrupt and factious conspiracies, to perjury, and to every species\r\nof injustice and oppression.\r\n\r\nXIV. That, in consequence of the aforesaid motives, and others\r\npretended, which were by no means a sufficient justification to the said\r\nWarren Hastings, he did appoint the woman aforesaid, called Munny Begum,\r\nwho had been of the lowest and most discreditable order in society,\r\naccording to the ideas prevalent in India, but from whom he received\r\nseveral sums of money, to be guardian to the Nabob in preference to his\r\nown mother, _and to administer the affairs of the government_ in the\r\nplace of the said Mahomed Reza Khân, the second Mussulman in rank after\r\nthe Nabob, and the first in knowledge, gravity, weight, and character\r\namong the Mussulmen of that province. And in order to try every method\r\nand to take every chance for his destruction, the said Warren Hastings\r\ndid maliciously and oppressively keep him under confinement, for a part\r\nof the time without any inquiry, and afterwards with a slow and dilatory\r\ntrial, for two years together.\r\n\r\nXV. That, notwithstanding a total revolution in the power, in part\r\navowedly made for his destruction, the persons appointed for his trial\r\ndid, on full inquiry, completely acquit the said Mahomed Reza Khân of\r\nthe criminal charges against him, on account of which he had been so\r\nlong persecuted and confined, and suffered much in mind, body, and\r\nfortune: and the Court of Directors, in their letter of the 3d of March,\r\n1775, testify their satisfaction in the conduct and result of the said\r\ninquiry, and did direct the restoration of the said Mahomed Reza Khân to\r\nliberty, and to the offices which he had lately held, which comprehended\r\nthe management of the Nabob's household, and the general superintendency\r\nof the justice of Bengal; but, according to the orders of the Court of\r\nDirectors, his appointments were reduced to thirty thousand pounds a\r\nyear, or thereabouts, of which he did make grievous complaint, on\r\naccount of the expenses attendant on his station, and the heavy debts\r\nwhich he had been obliged to contract during his unjust persecution and\r\nimprisonment aforesaid.\r\n\r\nXVI. That, on the removal of the said Mahomed Reza Khân from the\r\nsuperintendency of the criminal justice, and in consequence of letting\r\nthe province of Bengal in farm by the said Warren Hastings, several\r\ndangerous and mischievous innovations were made by him, the said Warren\r\nHastings, and the criminal justice of the country was almost wholly\r\nsubverted, and great irregularities and disorders did actually ensue.\r\n\r\nXVII. That the Council-General, established by act of Parliament in the\r\nyear 1773, did restore the said Mahomed Reza Khân, with the consent and\r\napprobation of the Nabob, (but under a protest from the said Warren\r\nHastings,) to his liberty and to his offices, according to the spirit of\r\nthe orders given by the Court of Directors as aforesaid; and the Court\r\nof Directors did approve of the said appointment, and did assure the\r\nsaid Mahomed Reza Khân of their favor and protection as long as his\r\nconduct should merit the same, in the following terms. \"As the abilities\r\nof Mahomed Reza Khân have been sufficiently manifested, as official\r\nexperience qualifies him for so high a station in a more eminent degree\r\nthan any other native with whom the Company has been connected, and as\r\nno proofs of maladministration have been established against him,\r\neither during the strict investigation of his conduct or since his\r\nretirement, we cannot under all circumstances but approve your\r\nrecommendation of him to the Nabob to constitute him his Naib. We are\r\nwell pleased that he has received that appointment, and authorize you to\r\nassure him of our favor, so long as a firm attachment to the interest of\r\nthe Company and a proper discharge of the duties of his station shall\r\nrender him worthy of our protection.\" And the said Mahomed Reza Khân did\r\ncontinue to execute the same without any complaint whatsoever of\r\nmalversation or negligence, in any manner or degree, in his said office.\r\n\r\nXVIII. That in March, 1778, the said Warren Hastings, under color that\r\nthe Nabob had completed his twentieth year, and had desired to be placed\r\nin the entire and uncontrolled management of his own affairs, and that\r\nMahomed Reza Khân should be removed from his office, and that Munny\r\nBegum, his step-mother, the dancing-girl aforesaid, \"should take on\r\nherself the management of the _nizamut_ [the government and general\r\nsuperintendency of criminal justice] without the interference of any\r\nperson whatsoever,\" and notwithstanding the contradictions in the\r\npretended applications from the Nabob, with whose incapacity for all\r\naffairs he was well acquainted, did, in defiance of the orders of the\r\nCourt of Directors, and without regard to the infamy of an arrangement\r\nmade for the evident and declared purpose of delivering not only the\r\nfamily with the prince, but the government and justice of a great\r\nkingdom, into such insufficient, corrupt, and scandalous hands, and\r\nthough he has declared his opinion \"that our national character is\r\nconcerned in the character which the Nabob may obtain in the public\r\nopinion,\" on obtaining a majority in Council, without any complaint,\r\nreal or pretended, remove the said Mahomed Reza from all his offices,\r\nand did partition his salary as a spoil in the following manner: to\r\nMunny Begum, the dancing-girl aforesaid, an additional allowance of\r\n72,000 rupees (7,200_l._) a year; to the Nabob's own mother but half\r\nthat sum, that is to say, 36,000 rupees (3,600_l._) a year; to Rajah\r\nGourdas, son of Nundcomar, (whom he had described as a weak young man,)\r\n72,000 rupees (7,200_l._) a year, as controller of the household; and to\r\na magistrate called Sudder ul Hock, who, in real subserviency to the\r\nsaid Munny Begum, was nominally to act in the department of criminal\r\njustice, 78,000 rupees (7,800_l._) a year: the total of which allowances\r\nexceeding the salary of Mahomed Reza Khân by 18,000 rupees (1,800_l._)\r\nyearly, he did, for the corrupt and scandalous purposes aforesaid, order\r\nthe same to be made up from the Company's treasury.\r\n\r\nXIX. That Mr. Francis and Mr. Wheler having moved that the execution of\r\nthe aforesaid arrangement, the whole expense of which, ordinary and\r\nextraordinary, was charged upon the Company's treasury, and therefore\r\ncould not be even colorably disposed of at the pretended will of the\r\nsaid Nabob, might be suspended until the pleasure of the Court of\r\nDirectors thereon should be known, and the same being resolved agreeably\r\nto law by a majority of the Council then present, the said Hastings,\r\nurging on violently the immediate execution of his corrupt project, and\r\nhaving obtained, by the return of Richard Barwell, Esquire, a majority\r\nin Council in his own casting vote, did rescind the aforesaid\r\nresolution, and did carry into immediate execution the aforesaid most\r\nunwarrantable, mischievous, and scandalous design.\r\n\r\nXX. That the consequences which might be expected from such a plan of\r\nadministration did almost instantly flow from it. For the person\r\nappointed to execute one of the offices which had been filled by Mahomed\r\nReza Khân did soon find that the eunuchs of Munny Begum began to employ\r\ntheir power with great superiority and insolence in all the concerns of\r\ngovernment and the administration of justice, and did endeavor to\r\ndispose of the offices relative to the same for their corrupt purposes,\r\nand to rob the Nabob's servants of their due allowances; and in his\r\nletter of the 1st September, 1778, he sent a complaint to the board,\r\nstating, \"that certain bad men had gained an ascendency over the Nabob's\r\ntemper, by whose instigation he acts\"; and after complaining of the\r\nslights he received from the Nabob, he adds: \"Thus they cause the Nabob\r\nto treat me, sometimes with indignity, at others with kindness, just as\r\nthey think proper to advise him; their view is, that, by compelling me\r\nto displeasure at most unworthy treatment, they may force me either to\r\nrelinquish my station, or to join with them, and act by their advice,\r\nand appoint creatures of their recommendation to the different offices,\r\nfrom which they might draw profit to themselves.\"\r\n\r\nXXI. That, in a subsequent letter to the Governor, the said\r\nSuperintendent of Justice did inform him, the said Warren Hastings, of\r\nthe audacious and corrupt manner in which, by violence, fraud, and\r\nforgery, the eunuchs of Munny Begum had abused the Nabob's name, to\r\ndeprive the judicial and executory officers of justice of the salaries\r\nwhich they ought to have drawn from the Company's treasury, in the\r\nfollowing words: \"The Begum's ministers, before my arrival, with the\r\nadvice of their counsellors, caused the Nabob to sign a receipt, in\r\nconsequence of which they received, at two different times, near 50,000\r\nrupees [5,000_l._], in the name of the officers of the Adawlut,\r\nPhousdary, &c., from the Company's sircars; and having drawn up an\r\naccount-current _in the manner they wished_, they had got the Nabob to\r\nsign it, and sent it to me.\" And in the same letter he asserts, \"that\r\nthese people had the Nabob entirely in their power.\"\r\n\r\nXXII. That the said Warren Hastings, upon this representation, did,\r\nnotwithstanding his late pretended opinion of the fitness and the right\r\nof the Nabob to the sole administration of his own affairs,\r\nauthoritatively forbid him from any interference therein, and ordered\r\nthat the whole should be left to the magistrate aforesaid; to which the\r\nNabob did, notwithstanding his pretended independence, yield an\r\nimmediate and unreserved submission: for the said Hastings's order being\r\ngiven on the 1st of September at Calcutta, he received _an answer_ from\r\nMoorshedabad on the 3d, in the following terms: \"Agreeably to your\r\npleasure, I have relinquished all concern with the affairs of the\r\nPhousdary and Adawlut, leaving the entire management in Sudder ul Hock's\r\nhands.\" Which said circumstance, as well as many others, abundantly\r\nproves that all the Nabob's actions were in truth and fact entirely\r\ngoverned by the influence of the said Hastings, and that, however the\r\nsaid Hastings may have publicly discouraged the corrupt transactions of\r\nthe said court, yet he did secretly uphold the authority and influence\r\nof Munny Begum, who did entirely direct, with his knowledge and\r\ncountenance, all the proceedings therein. For\r\n\r\nXXIII. That on the 13th of the same month of September he did receive a\r\nfurther complaint of the corrupt and fraudulent practices of the chief\r\neunuch of the said Munny Begum; and these corrupt practices did so\r\ncontinue and increase, that on the 10th of October, 1778, he was obliged\r\nto confess, in the strongest terms, the pernicious consequences of his\r\nbefore-created unwarrantable and illegal arrangements; for, in a letter\r\nof that date to the Nabob, he expresses himself as follows. \"At your\r\nExcellency's request, I sent Sudder ul Hock Khân to take on him the\r\nadministration of the affairs of the Adawlut and Phousdary, and hoped by\r\nthat means not only to have given satisfaction to your Excellency, but\r\nthat, through his abilities and experience, these affairs would have\r\nbeen conducted in such manner as to have secured the peace of the\r\ncountry and the happiness of the people; and it is with the greatest\r\nconcern I learn that this measure is so far from being attended with the\r\nexpected advantages, that the affairs both of the Phousdary and Adawlut\r\nare in the greatest confusion imaginable, and daily robberies and\r\nmurders are perpetrated throughout the country. This is evidently owing\r\nto the want of a proper authority in the person appointed to superintend\r\nthem. I therefore addressed your Excellency on the importance and\r\ndelicacy of the affairs in question, and of the necessity of lodging\r\nfull power in the hands of the person chosen to administer them; in\r\nreply to which your Excellency expressed sentiments coincident with\r\nmine; notwithstanding which, your dependants and people, actuated by\r\n_selfish, and avaricious views, have by their interference so impeded\r\nthe business as to throw the whole country into a state of confusion,\r\nfrom which nothing can retrieve it but an unlimited power lodged in the\r\nhands of the superintendent_. I therefore request that your Excellency\r\nwill give the strictest injunctions to all your dependants not to\r\ninterfere in any manner with any matter relative to the affairs of the\r\nAdawlut and Phousdary, and that you will yourself relinquish all\r\ninterference therein, and leave them entirely to the management of\r\nSudder ul Hock Khân: this is absolutely necessary to restore the country\r\nto a state of tranquillity.\" And he concluded by again recommending the\r\nNabob to withdraw all interference with the administrator aforesaid:\r\n\"otherwise a measure which I adopted at your Excellency's request, and\r\nwith a view to your satisfaction and the benefit of the country, will be\r\nattended with quite contrary effects, and bring discredit on me.\"\r\n\r\nXXIV. That the said Hastings, in the letter aforesaid, in which he so\r\nstrongly condemns the acts and so clearly marks out the mischievous\r\neffects of the corrupt influence under which alone the Nabob acted, and\r\nunder which alone, from his known incapacity, and his dependence on the\r\nperson supported by the said Hastings, he could act, did propose to put\r\nall the offices of justice (which on another occasion he had requested\r\nhim to _permit_ to remain in the hands which then held them) into his\r\nown disposal,--telling him, or rather the woman and eunuchs who governed\r\nhim, \"that, if his Excellency has any plan for the management of the\r\naffairs in future, be pleased to communicate it to me, and every\r\nattention shall be paid to give your Excellency satisfaction\": by which\r\nmeans not only particular parts, as before, but the whole system of\r\njustice was to be afloat, and to be subject to the purposes of the\r\naforesaid corrupt cabal of women and eunuchs.\r\n\r\nXXV. That the Court of Directors, on receiving an account of the above\r\narrangements, and being well apprised of the spirit, intention, and\r\nprobable effect of the same, did, in a clear, firm, and decisive manner,\r\nexpress their condemnation of the measure, and their rejection and\r\nreprobation of all the pretended grounds and reasons on which the same\r\nwas supported,--marking distinctly his prevarication and contradictions\r\nin the same, and pointing to him their full conviction of the unworthy\r\nmotives on which he had made so shameful an arrangement: telling him, in\r\nthe 17th paragraph of their general letter of the 4th of February, 1779,\r\n\"The Nabob's letters of the 25th and 30th of August, of the 3d of\r\nSeptember, and 17th of November, leave us no doubt of the _true_ design\r\nof this _extraordinary_ business being _to bring forward_ Munny Begum,\r\nand again to invest her with improper power and influence,\r\nnotwithstanding our former declaration, that _so great_ a part of the\r\nNabob's allowance had been embezzled and misapplied under her\r\nsuperintendence.\"\r\n\r\nXXVI. That, in consequence of the censure and condemnation of the\r\nunwarrantable measures of the said Warren Hastings by the Court of\r\nDirectors, on the aforesaid and other weighty and substantial grounds,\r\nthey did order and direct as follows, in the 20th paragraph of the\r\ngeneral letter of the same date. \"As we deem it for the welfare of the\r\ncountry that the office of Naib Subahdar be for the present continued,\r\nand that this high office should be filled by a person of wisdom,\r\nexperience, and of approved fidelity to the Company, and as we have no\r\nreason to alter the opinion given of Mahomed Reza Khân in our letter of\r\nthe 24th of December, 1776, we positively direct, that you forthwith\r\nsignify to the Nabob Mobarek ul Dowlah our pleasure that Mahomed Reza\r\nKhân be immediately restored to the office of Naib Subahdar; and we\r\nfurther direct, that Mahomed Reza Khân be again assured of the\r\ncontinuance of our favor, so long as a firm attachment to the interest\r\nof the Company and a proper discharge of the duties of his station shall\r\nrender him worthy of our protection.\"\r\n\r\nXXVII. That the aforesaid direction did convey in it such evident and\r\ncogent reason, and was so far enforced by justice to individuals and by\r\nregard to the peace and happiness of the natives, as well as by the\r\ncommon decorum to be observed in all the transactions of government,\r\nthat the said Hastings ought to have yielded a cheerful obedience\r\nthereto, even if he had not been by a positive statute, and his relation\r\nof servant to the Company, bound to that just submission. Yet the said\r\nHastings did, without denying or evading any one of the reasons assigned\r\nby the Court of Directors, or controverting the scandalous motives\r\nassigned by them for his conduct, contumaciously refuse obedience to the\r\nabove positive order, on pretence that the Nabob, who, he had declared\r\nit on record \"to be as visible as the light of the sun, is a mere\r\npageant, and without even the shadow of authority,\" did dissent from the\r\nsame; and he did encourage the said Nabob, or rather the eunuchs, the\r\ncorrupt ministers of Munny Begum, to oppose himself and themselves to\r\nthe authority of the said Court of Directors: by which means the\r\narrangement, three times either ratified or expressly ordered by them,\r\nwas wholly defeated; the aforesaid corrupt system was continued; Mahomed\r\nReza Khân was not restored to his office; and a lesson was taught to the\r\nnatives of all ranks, that the declared approbation, the avowed\r\nsanction, and the decided authority of the Court of Directors were\r\nwholly nugatory to their protection against the corrupt influence of\r\ntheir servants.\r\n\r\nXXVIII. That the said Warren Hastings, on a reconciliation with Mr.\r\nFrancis, one of the Council-General, who made it a condition thereof\r\nthat certain of the Company's orders should be obeyed, and that Mahomed\r\nReza Khân should be restored to his offices, did, a considerable time\r\nafter, notwithstanding the pretended reluctance of the Nabob, and his\r\npretended freedom, make, for his convenience in the said accommodation,\r\nthe arrangement which he had unwarrantably and illegally refused to the\r\norders of the Court of Directors, and did of his own authority and that\r\nof the board restore Mahomed Reza Khân to his offices.\r\n\r\nXXIX. That soon after the departure of the said Mr. Francis he did again\r\ndeprive the said Mahomed Reza Khân of his said offices, and did make\r\nseveral great changes in the constitution of the criminal justice in the\r\nsaid country; and after having, under pretence of the Nabob's\r\nsufficiency for the management of his own affairs, displaced, without\r\nany specific charge, trial, or inquiry whatsoever, the said Mahomed Reza\r\nKhân, he did submit the said Nabob to the entire direction, in all parts\r\nof his concerns, of a Resident of his own nomination, Sir John D'Oyly,\r\nBaronet, and did order an account of the most minute parts of his\r\ndomestic economy to be made out, and to be delivered to the said Sir\r\nJohn D'Oyly, in the following words, contained in a paper by him\r\nintituled, INSTRUCTIONS from the Governor-General to the Nabob Mobarek\r\nul Dowlah respecting his conduct in the management of his affairs. \"You\r\nwill be pleased to direct your _mutseddies_ to form an account of the\r\nfixed sums of your monthly expenses, such as servants' wages in the\r\ndifferent departments, pensions, and other allowances, as well as of the\r\nestimated amount of variable expenses, to be delivered to Sir John\r\nD'Oyly _for my inspection_. I have given such orders to Sir John D'Oyly\r\nas will enable him to propose to you such reductions of the pensions and\r\nother allowances, and such a distribution of the variable expenses, as\r\nshall be proportionable to the total sum of your monthly income; _and I\r\nmust request you will conform to it_.\" And he did, in the subsequent\r\narticles of his said instructions, order the whole management to be\r\ndirected by Sir John D'Oyly, subject to his own directions as aforesaid;\r\nand did even direct what company he should keep; and did throw\r\nreflections on some persons, in places the nearest to him, as of bad\r\ncharacter and base origin,--persons whom he should decline to name as\r\nsuch, \"unless he heard that they still availed themselves of his\r\ngoodness to retain _the places_ which they improperly hold near his\r\nperson.\" And he did particularly order the said Nabob not to admit any\r\nEnglish, but such as the said Sir John D'Oyly should approve, to his\r\npresence; and did repeat the said order in the following peremptory\r\nmanner: \"You _must forbid any_ person of _that nation_ to be intruded\r\ninto _your_ presence without _his_ introduction.\" And he did require his\r\nobedience in the following authoritative style: \"I shall think myself\r\nobliged to interfere _in another manner_, if you neglect it.\"\r\n\r\nXXX. That he, the said Warren Hastings, did insult the captive condition\r\nof the said Nabob by informing him, in his imperious instructions\r\naforesaid, that this total, blind, and implicit obedience, in every\r\nrespect whatsoever, to Sir John D'Oyly and himself personally, and\r\nwithout any reference to the board, \"was the very _conditions_ of the\r\ncompliance of the Governor-General and Council with his late\r\nrequisition\"; which requisition was, that he should enjoy _the free and\r\nuncontrolled_ management of his own affairs. And though the said captive\r\ndid offer, as he, the said Hastings, himself admits, _four lacs_ of his\r\nstipend, at that time reduced to sixteen lac, for _the free use of the\r\nremainder_, yet he did place him, the said Nabob, in the state of\r\nservitude in the said instructions laid down but a very short time after\r\nhe had assumed and used the said Nabob's independent rights as a ground\r\nfor refusing to obey the Company's orders,--and although he has\r\ndeclared, or pretended, on another occasion, which he would have thought\r\nsimilar, that any attempt to limit the household expenses of the Nabob\r\nof Oude was an indignity, \"which no man living, however mean his rank in\r\nlife, or dependent his condition in it, would permit to be exercised by\r\nany other, without the want or forfeiture of every manly principle.\"\r\n\r\nXXXI. That the said Warren Hastings did order the said stipend (which\r\nwas to be distributed, in the minutest particular, according to the said\r\nHastings's personal directions) to be paid monthly, not to any officer\r\nof the Nabob, but to the said Resident, Sir John D'Oyly. And whereas the\r\nGovernor-General and Council did, on the appointment of Mahomed Reza\r\nKhân, according to their duty, instruct him, that \"he do conform to the\r\n_orders_ of the Company, which direct that an annual account of the\r\nNabob's expenses be transmitted through the Resident at the Durbar, for\r\nthe inspection of this _board_\" the said Hastings, in making his new\r\nestablishment in favor of his Resident, did wholly omit the said\r\ninstruction, and did confine the said communication to _himself_,\r\nprivately. And in fact it does not appear that any account whatsoever of\r\nthe disposition of the said large sum, exceeding 160,000_l._ sterling a\r\nyear, has been laid before the board, or at least that any such account\r\nhas been transmitted to the Court of Directors; and it is not fitting\r\nthat any British servant of the Company should have the management of\r\nany public money, much less of so great a sum, without a public\r\nwell-vouched account of the specific expenditure thereof.\r\n\r\nXXXII. That the Court of Directors did, on the 17th of May, 1766,\r\npropose certain rules for regulating the correspondence of the Resident\r\nwith the Nabob of Bengal, in which they did direct, as a principle for\r\nthe said regulations, as follows (paragraph 16th). \"We would have his\r\ncorrespondence to be carried on with the _Select Committee_ through the\r\nchannel of the President: he should keep a diary of all his\r\ntransactions. His correspondence with the natives _must be publicly\r\nconducted_: copies of _all_ his letters, sent and received, be\r\ntransmitted monthly to the Presidency, with duplicates and triplicates\r\nto be transmitted home in our general packet by every ship.\"\r\n\r\nXXXIII. That the President and Select Committee (Lord Clive being then\r\nPresident) did approve of the whole substantial part of the said\r\nregulation (the diary excepted); and the principle, in all matters of\r\naccount, ought to have been strictly adhered to, whatever limitations\r\nmay have been given to the office of Resident. Yet he, the said Warren\r\nHastings, in defiance of the aforesaid good rules, orders, and late\r\nprecedent in conformity to the same, did not only withhold any order for\r\nthe purpose, but, in order to carry on the business of the said durbar\r\nin a clandestine manner for his own purposes, did, as aforesaid, exclude\r\nall English from an intercourse with the Nabob, who might carry\r\ncomplaints or representations to the board, or the Court of Directors,\r\nof his condition, or the conduct of the Resident,--and did further, to\r\ndefeat all possible publicity, insinuate to him to give the preference\r\nto verbal communication above letters, in the words following, of the\r\nninth article of his instructions to the Nabob: \"Although I desire to\r\nreceive your letters frequently, yet, as many matters will occur which\r\ncannot be _so easily explained by letters as by conversation_, I desire\r\nthat you will on such occasions give your orders to him respecting such\r\npoints as you may desire to have imparted to me; and I, postponing every\r\nother concern, will give an immediate and the most satisfactory reply\r\nconcerning them.\" Accordingly, no relation whatsoever has been received\r\nby the Court of Directors of the said Nabob's affairs, nor any account\r\nof the money monthly paid, except from public fame, which reports that\r\nhis affairs are in groat disorder, his servants unpaid, and many of them\r\ndismissed, and all the Mussulmen dependent on his family in a state of\r\nindigence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII.--THE MOGUL DELIVERED UP TO THE MAHRATTAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. That Shah Allum, the prince commonly called the Great Mogul, or, by\r\neminence, _The King_, is, or lately was, in the possession of the\r\nancient capital of Hindostan, and though without any considerable\r\nterritory, and without a revenue sufficient to maintain a moderate\r\nstate, he is still much respected and considered, and the custody of his\r\nperson is eagerly sought by many of the princes in India, on account of\r\nthe use to be made of his title and authority; and it was for the\r\ninterest of the East India Company, that, while on one hand no wars\r\nshall be entered into in support of his pretensions, on the other no\r\nsteps should be taken which may tend to deliver him into the hands of\r\nany of the powerful states of that country, but that he should be\r\ntreated with friendship, good faith, and respectful attention.\r\n\r\nII. That Warren Hastings, in contradiction to this safe, just, and\r\nhonorable policy, strongly prescribed and enforced by the orders of the\r\nCourt of Directors, did, at a time when he was engaged in a negotiation\r\nthe declared purpose of which was to give peace to India, concur with\r\nthe captain-general of the Mahratta state, called Mahdajee Sindia, in\r\nhostile designs against the few remaining territories of that same Mogul\r\nemperor, by virtue of whose grant the Company actually possess the\r\ngovernment and enjoy the revenues of great provinces, and also against\r\nthe possessions of a Mahomedan chief called Nudjif Khân, a person of\r\nmuch merit with the East India Company, in acknowledgment of which they\r\nhad granted him a pension, included in the tribute due to the king, and,\r\ntogether with that tribute, taken from him by the said Warren Hastings,\r\nthough expressly _guarantied_ to him by the Company. With both these\r\npowers the Company had been in friendship, and were actually at peace at\r\nthe time of the said clandestine concurrence in a design against them;\r\nand the said Hastings hath since declared, that the right of one of\r\nthem, namely, \"the right of the Mogul emperor, to our assistance, has\r\nbeen constantly acknowledged.\"\r\n\r\nIII. That the said Warren Hastings, at the time of his treacherous\r\nconcurrence in a design against a power which he was himself of opinion\r\nwe were bound to assist, and against whom there was no doubt he was\r\nbound neither to form nor to concur in any hostile attempt, did give a\r\ncaution to Colonel Muir, to whom the negotiation aforesaid was intrusted\r\non the part of the Company, against \"inserting anything in the treaty\r\nwhich might _expressly_ mark our _knowledge_ of his [the Mahratta\r\ngeneral's] views, _or concurrence in them_.\" Which said transaction was\r\nfull of duplicity and fraud; and the crime of the said Hastings therein\r\nis aggravated by his having some years before withheld the tribute which\r\nby treaty was solemnly agreed to be paid to the said king, on pretence\r\nthat he had thrown himself, for the recovery of his city of Delhi, on\r\nthe protection of the Mahrattas, whom the said Warren Hastings then\r\ncalled _the natural enemies_ of the Company, and the growth of whose\r\npower he then alleged to be highly dangerous to the interests of this\r\nkingdom in India.\r\n\r\nIV. That, after having concurred, in the manner before mentioned, in a\r\ndesign of the Mahrattas against the Mogul, and notwithstanding he, the\r\nsaid Warren Hastings, had formerly declared, \"that with him [the Mogul]\r\nour connection had been a long time suspended, and _he wished never to\r\nsee it renewed_, as it had proved a fatal drain to the wealth of Bengal\r\nand the treasury of the Company, without yielding one advantage or\r\npossible resource, even of remote benefits, in return,\" the said Warren\r\nHastings did nevertheless, on or about the month of March, 1783, with\r\nthe privity and consent of the members of the board, but by no\r\nauthoritative act, dispatch, as agents of him, the Governor-General\r\nonly, and not as agents of the Governor-General and Council, as they\r\nought to have been, certain persons, among whom were Major Browne and\r\nMajor Davy, to the court of the king at Delhi, and did there enter into\r\ncertain engagements with the said king by the means of those agents, and\r\ndid carry on certain private and dangerous intrigues for various\r\npurposes, particularly for making war in favor of the said king against\r\nsome powers or princes not precisely described, but which, as may be\r\ninferred from a subsequent correspondence, were certain Mahomedan\r\nprinces in the neighborhood of Delhi in amity with the Company, and some\r\nof them at that time in the actual service and in the apparent\r\nconfidence and favor of the said Mogul; and he did order Major Browne to\r\noffer to the Mogul king to provide for the _entire_ expense of _any_\r\ntroops the Shah [the said king] might require; and the proposal was\r\naccordingly accepted, with the conditions annexed: by which proposal and\r\nacceptance thereof the East India Company was placed in a situation of\r\ngreat and perplexing difficulty; since either they were to engage, at an\r\nunlimited _expense_, in new wars, contrary to their orders, contrary to\r\ntheir general declared policy, and contrary to the published resolutions\r\nof the House of Commons, and wholly incompatible with the state of their\r\nfinances, or, to preserve peace, they must risk the imputation of a new\r\nviolation of faith, by departing from an agreement made on the voluntary\r\nproposal of their own government,--the agent of the said Hastings having\r\ndeclared, in his letter to the said Hastings, by him communicated to the\r\nboard, \"that the business of assisting the Shah [the Mogul emperor] can\r\nand _must_ go on, if we wish to be secure in India, or regarded as a\r\nnation of faith and honor.\"\r\n\r\nV. That the said Warren Hastings did, on the 20th day of January, 1784,\r\nsend in circulation to the other members of the Council a letter to him\r\nfrom his agent, Major Browne, dated at Delhi, on the 30th of December,\r\n1783, viz., that letter to which the foregoing references are made, in\r\nwhich the said Browne did directly press, and indirectly (though\r\nsufficiently and strongly) suggest, several highly dangerous measures\r\nfor realizing the general offers and engagements of the said Warren\r\nHastings,--proposing, that, besides a proportion of field artillery, and\r\na train of battering cannon for the purpose of sieges, six regiments of\r\nsepoys in the Company's service should be transferred to that of the\r\nsaid king, and that certain other corps should also be raised for the\r\nsaid service in the English provinces and dependencies, to be\r\nimmediately under the king's [the Mogul's] orders, and to be maintained\r\nby assignments of territorial revenue within the province of Oude, a\r\ndependent member of the British government, but with a caution against\r\nhaving any British officer with the same; the said Major Browne\r\nexpressing his caution as followeth: \"If any European officer _be_ with\r\nthis corps, a very nice judgment indeed must direct the choice; for\r\nscarce any are in the smallest degree _fit_ for _such_ employ, but much\r\nmore likely to do harm than good.\" And the letter aforesaid being\r\nwithout any observation thereon, or any disavowal of the matters of fact\r\nor of the counsels so strongly and authoritatively delivered therein by\r\nthe said Warren Hastings's agent, and without any mark of disapprobation\r\nof any part of his plan, whether that of the assignment of territory\r\nbelonging to the Company's allies for the maintenance of troops which\r\nwere to be by that plan put under the orders of a foreign independent\r\npower, or that of employing the said troops without any British officer\r\nwith them, or for his alarming observation by him entered on the\r\nCompany's records, which, if not an implied censure on the nature of the\r\nservice in which British officers are supposed improper to be trusted,\r\nis a strong reflection on the character of the British officers, which\r\nwas to render them unfit to be employed in an honorable service,--the\r\nsaid Warren Hastings did thereby give a countenance to the said\r\nunwarrantable and dangerous proposals and reflections.\r\n\r\nVI. That a considerable time before the production and circulation of\r\nMajor Browne's letter, the said Hastings did enter a Minute of\r\nConsultation containing a proposition similar in the general intent to\r\nthat in the said letter contained for assisting the Mogul with a\r\nmilitary force; but the other members of the board did disagree thereto,\r\nand, being alarmed at the disposition so strongly shown by the said\r\nHastings to engage in new wars and dangerous foreign connections, and\r\npossibly having intelligence of the proceedings of his agent, did call\r\nupon him to produce his instructions to Major Browne; and he did, on the\r\n5th of October, 1783, and not before, enter on the Consultations a\r\ncertain paper purporting to be the instructions which he had given to\r\nMajor Browne the preceding March, the time of his, the said Browne's,\r\nappointment, in which pretended instructions no direction whatsoever was\r\ngiven to the effect of his, the said Hastings's, Minute of Consultation\r\npropounded: that is to say, no power was given in the said instructions\r\nto make a direct offer of military aid to the Mogul, or to form the\r\narrangements stated by the said Browne, in his letter to the said\r\nHastings, as having been made by the express authority of the said\r\nHastings himself; but the said instructions contained nothing further on\r\nthat subject but a conditional direction, that, in case a military force\r\nshould be required for the Mogul's aid or protection, the Major is to\r\nknow the service on which it is to be employed, and the resources from\r\nwhence it is to be paid; and the instructions produced as his real\r\ninstructions by the said Hastings are so guarded as to caution the said\r\nBrowne against _taking any part in the intrigues of those who are about\r\nthe King's person_. By which letters, instructions, and transactions,\r\ncompared with each other, it appears that the said Warren Hastings,\r\nafter six months' delay in entering of (contrary to the Company's order)\r\nany instructions to the said Browne, did at last enter a false paper as\r\nthe true, or that he did give other secret instructions, totally\r\ndifferent from, and even opposite to, his public ostensible\r\ninstructions, thereby to deceive the Council, and to carry on with less\r\nobstruction dark and dangerous intrigues, contrary to the orders of the\r\nCourt of Directors, to the true policy of this kingdom, and to the\r\nsafety of the British possessions in the East.\r\n\r\nVII. That the said letter from Major Browne was by the said Warren\r\nHastings transmitted to the Court of Directors, without being\r\naccompanied by any part of the previous correspondence; by which wilful\r\nconcealment the said Warren Hastings is guilty of an high and criminal\r\ndisrespect to the Court of Directors, and of a most flagrant breach and\r\nviolation of their orders, which he was bound by an act of Parliament to\r\nobey.\r\n\r\nVIII. That the said Hastings having early in the year 1784 procured to\r\nhimself a deputation to act in the upper provinces, the Council, being\r\nwell aware of his disposition to engage in unwarrantable designs against\r\nthe neighboring states, did expressly confine his powers to the\r\ncircumstance of his actual residence within the Company's provinces. But\r\nit appears that ways were found out by which he hoped to defeat the\r\nprecautions of the board: for the said Warren Hastings did write from\r\nLucknow, the capital of the country of Oude, to the Court of Directors,\r\na certain postscript of a letter, dated the 4th of May, 1784, in which\r\nhe informs the Court that the son and heir-apparent of the Great Mogul\r\nhad taken refuge with him and the Nabob of Oude; that he had a\r\nconference with that prince on the 10th of the same month of May, \"no\r\nperson being either present or within hearing\" during the same; and that\r\nin the said conference the prince had informed him of the distresses of\r\nhis father, and his wish for the relief of the king and the restoration\r\nof the dominions of his house, as well as to rescue him from the power\r\nof certain persons not named, who degraded him into a mere instrument of\r\ntheir interested and sordid designs, and that, on a failure of his\r\napplication to him, he would either return to his father, or proceed to\r\nCalcutta, and thence to England; and that the said Warren Hastings did\r\ngive him an answer to the following effect: \"That our [the British]\r\ngovernment had just obtained relief from a state of universal warfare,\r\nand required a term of repose; that our whole nation was weary of war,\r\nand dreaded the renewal of it, _and would he equally alarmed at any\r\nmovement of which it could not see the issue or progress, but which\r\nmight eventually tend to create new hostilities_; that he came hither\r\n[to Lucknow] with a limited authority, and could not, if he chose it,\r\nengage in a business of that nature _without the concurrence of his\r\ncolleagues in office, who he believed would be adverse to it_; that he\r\nwould represent the same to the joint members of his own government, and\r\nwait their determination. In the mean time he advised the prince to make\r\nadvances to Mahdajee Sindia, both because our government _was in\r\nintimate and sworn connection_ with him, and because he was the\r\neffectual head of the Mahratta state; besides that he [the said Warren\r\nHastings] feared his [Sindia's] taking the other side of the question,\r\nunless he was early prevented.\"\r\n\r\nIX. That in the statement of this discourse there is much criminal\r\nreserve towards the Court of Directors,--it not appearing distinctly\r\nwhat the objects were, nor who the persons concerned, nor what the side\r\nwas which he apprehended the Mahrattas might take, if not prevented by\r\nhis advances; and in the discourse itself there were many particulars\r\nhighly criminal, namely,--for that in the said conversation, in which he\r\ndescribes himself as declining a compliance with the request of the\r\nprince on account of the aversion (therein strongly expressed) of his\r\ncolleagues, of the Company, and of the whole British nation, to engage\r\nin any measures which might even \"_eventually lead to hostilities_,\" he\r\nspoke to the prince as if he had been entirely ignorant of the offers\r\nwhich but five months before had been made to the king, his father, on\r\nthe part of that very government, (whose repugnance to such measures he\r\nthen for the first time chose to profess, but which he always had\r\nknown,) through Major Browne, the Company's representative at the court\r\nof Delhi, \"to provide for the _entire_ expense of _any_ troops which the\r\nShah [the king] might require,\" and that this was \"what the Resident had\r\n_always_ proposed to the king and his confidential ministers,\"--the said\r\nBrowne further declaring, \"that, if, in consequence of the said\r\nproposals, certain arrangements for the Shah's service by _troops_ were\r\nnot immediately ordered, in his opinion all our [English government's]\r\n_offers and promises_ will be considered as false and insidious.\" This\r\nbeing the known state of the business, as represented by the said\r\nHastings's own agent, and this the public opinion of it, although to\r\nimpose on the ignorance of the prince with regard to the proceedings at\r\nhis father's court would have been unworthy in itself, yet he, the said\r\nWarren Hastings, could not hope to succeed in such imposition, as in the\r\npostscript aforesaid he represents the said prince (who was the king's\r\neldest son, and thirty-six years of age) as a person of considerable\r\nqualifications, and perfectly acquainted with the transactions at his\r\nfather's court, and as one who had long held the _principal_ and most\r\nactive part in the little that remained of _the administration of Shah\r\nAllum_. And the said Hastings conferring with a prince so well\r\ninstructed, without making the slightest allusions to his said positive\r\nand recent engagements, or without giving any explanation with regard to\r\nthem, the said Warren Hastings must appear to the said prince either as\r\na person not only contracting engagements, but actually being the first\r\nmover and proposer of them, without any authority from _his colleagues_,\r\nand against theirs and the general inclination of the British nation,\r\nand on that ground not to be trusted, or that he had used this plea of\r\ndisagreement between him and his Council as a pretence, set up without\r\ncolor or decency, for a gross violation of his own engagements, leaving\r\nthe princes and states of the country no solid ground on which they can\r\nor ought to contract with the Company, to the utter destruction of all\r\npublic confidence, and to the equal disgrace of the national candor,\r\nintegrity, and wisdom.\r\n\r\nX. That in a letter dated from the same place, Lucknow, the 16th of the\r\nfollowing June, 1784, the said Warren Hastings informs the Court of\r\nDirectors, that Major Browne, their agent to the Mogul, had arrived\r\nthere in the character also of agent from the Mogul, with two sets of\r\ninstructions from two opposite parties in his ministry, which\r\ninstructions were directly contrary to each other: the first, which were\r\nthe ostensible instructions, being to engage the said Hastings, in the\r\nMogul's name, to enter into a treaty of mutual alliance with a chief of\r\nthe country, then minister to the said Mogul, called Afrasaib Khân; the\r\nsecond were from another principal person, called Mudjed ul Dowlah, also\r\na minister of the said Mogul, (but styled in the said letter\r\n_confidential_, for distinction,) which were directly destructive of the\r\nformer; and the said latter instructions, to which it seems credence was\r\nto be given, were sent \"under the most solemn adjurations of secrecy.\"\r\nThe purpose of these latter and secret instructions was to require the\r\nCompany's aid in freeing the Mogul from the oppressions of his servants,\r\nnamely, from the oppressions of the said Afrasaib, between whom and the\r\nCompany Major Browne (at once agent to that Company, and to two\r\nopposite factions in the Mogul's court) accepted a power to make a\r\ntreaty of mutual alliance under the sanction of his sovereign. And it\r\ndoes not appear that he, Warren Hastings, did discountenance the\r\ndouble-dealing and fraudulent agencies of his and the Company's minister\r\nat that court, or did disavow any particular in the letter from him, the\r\nsaid Browne, of the 30th of December, 1783, stating the offers made on\r\nhis part to the Mogul, so contradictory to his late declarations to the\r\nheir-apparent of that monarch, or did give any reprimand to the said\r\nBrowne, or did show any mark of displeasure against him, as having acted\r\nwithout orders, but did again send him, with renewed confidence, to the\r\ncourt aforesaid.\r\n\r\nXI. That the said Warren Hastings, still pursuing his said evil designs,\r\ndid apply to the Council for discretionary powers relative to the\r\nintrigues and factions in the Mogul's court, giving assurances of his\r\nresolution not to proceed against their sense; but the said Council,\r\nbeing fully aware of his disposition, and having Major Browne's letter,\r\nrecorded by himself, the said Warren Hastings, before them, did refuse\r\nto grant the said discretionary powers, but, on the contrary, did exhort\r\nhim \"most sedulously and cautiously to avoid, in his correspondence with\r\nthe different princes in India, whatever may commit, or be strained into\r\nan interpretation of committing the Company, either as to their army or\r\ntreasure,\"--observing, \"that the Company's orders are positive against\r\ntheir interference in the objects of dispute between the country\r\npowers.\"\r\n\r\nXII. That, in order to subvert the plain and natural interpretation\r\ngiven by the Council to the orders of the Court of Directors, and to\r\njustify his dangerous intrigues, the said Warren Hastings, in his letter\r\nof the 16th June, 1784, to the said Court, did, in a most insolent and\r\ncontemptuous manner, endeavor to persuade them of their ignorance of the\r\ntrue sense of their own orders, and to limit their prohibition of\r\ninterference with the disputes of the country powers to such country\r\npowers as are _permanent_,--expressing himself as follows: \"The faction\r\nwhich now surrounds the throne [the Mogul's throne] is widely different\r\nfrom the idea which your commands are intended to convey by the\r\nexpressions to which you have generally applied them, of _country\r\npowers_, to which that _of permanency is a necessary adjunct_, and which\r\nmay be more properly compared to a splendid bubble, which the slightest\r\nbreath of opposition may dissipate with every trace of its existence.\"\r\nBy which construction the said Hastings did endeavor to persuade the\r\nCourt of Directors that they meant to confine their prohibition of\r\nsinister intrigues to those powers only who could not be easily hurt by\r\nthem, and whose strength was such that their resentment of such\r\nclandestine interference was to be dreaded; but that, where the powers\r\nwere weak and fragile, such intrigues might be allowed.\r\n\r\nXIII. That the said Hastings, further to persuade the Court of Directors\r\nto involve themselves in the affairs of the Mogul, and to reconcile this\r\nmeasure with his former conduct and declared opinions, did write to them\r\nto the following effect: That \"at that former period to which the\r\nancient policy with regard to the Mogul applied, the king's authority\r\nwas sufficiently respected\" (which he knew not to be true,--having\r\nhimself declared, in his minute of the 25th of October, 1774, \"that he\r\nremained at Delhi, the ancient capital of the empire, _a mere cipher_ in\r\nthe administration of it\") to maintain itself against common\r\nvicissitudes; that he would not have advised interference, if the king\r\nhimself retained the exercise of it, _however feeble_, in his own hands;\r\nthat, if it [the Mogul's authority] is suffered to receive its final\r\nextinction, it is impossible to foresee _what power may arise out of its\r\nruins_, or what events may be linked in the same chain of revolution\r\nwith it: but your interests _may_ suffer by it, your reputation\r\n_certainly will_, as his right to our assistance _has been constantly\r\nacknowledged_, and by a train of consequences to which our government\r\nhas not intentionally given birth, but most especially by the movements\r\nwhich _its influence, by too near an approach_, has excited, it has\r\nunfortunately become the efficient instrument of a great portion of the\r\nking's present distresses and dangers,--intimating (as well as the\r\nstudied obscurity of his expressions will permit anything to be\r\ndiscerned) that his own late intrigues had been among the causes of the\r\ndistresses and dangers, which by new intrigues he did pretend to remove:\r\nand he did conclude this part of his letter with some loose general\r\nexpressions of his caution not to affect the Company's interests or\r\nrevenues by any measures he might at that time take.\r\n\r\nXIV. That the principle, so far as the same hath been directly avowed,\r\nof the said proceedings at the Mogul's court, was as altogether\r\nirrational, and the pretended object as impracticable, as the means\r\ntaken in pursuit of it were fraudulent and dishonorable, namely, the\r\nrestoration of the Mogul in some degree to the dignity of his situation,\r\nand to his free agency in the conduct of his affairs. For the said\r\nHastings, at the very time in which he did with the greatest apparent\r\nearnestness urge the purpose which he pretended to have in view with\r\nregard to the dignity and liberty of the Mogul emperor, did represent\r\nhim as a person wholly disqualified, and even indisposed, to take any\r\nactive part whatsoever in the conduct of his own affairs, and that any\r\nattempt for that purpose would be utterly impracticable; and this he\r\nhath stated to the Court of Directors as a matter of public notoriety,\r\nin his said letter of the 16th of June, 1784, in the following\r\nemphatical and decisive terms.\r\n\r\n\"_You need not be told_ the character of the king, whose inertness, and\r\nthe habit of long-suffering, has debased his dignity and the fortunes of\r\nhis house _beyond the power of retrieving either the one or the other_.\r\nWhilst his personal repose is undisturbed, he will _prefer_ to live in\r\n_the meanest state of indigence_, under the rule of men whose views are\r\nbounded by avarice and the power which they derive from his authority,\r\nrather than commit any share of it to his own sons, (though his\r\naffection for them is boundless in every other respect,) from a natural\r\njealousy, founded on the experience of a very different combination of\r\nthose circumstances which once served as a temptation and example of\r\nunlawful ambition in the princes of the royal line. His ministers, from\r\na policy more reasonable, have constantly employed every means of\r\ninfluence to confirm this disposition, and to prevent his sons from\r\nhaving any share in the distribution of affairs, so as to have\r\nestablished a complete usurpation of the royal prerogative under its\r\nown sanction and patronage.\"\r\n\r\nXV. That the said Warren Hastings, having given this opinion of the\r\nsovereign for whose freedom he pretended so anxious a concern, did\r\ndescribe the minister with whom he had long acted in concurrence, and\r\nfrom whom he had just received the extraordinary secret embassy\r\naforesaid for the purpose of effecting the deliverance of his master,\r\nthe Mogul, from the usurpations of _his ministers_, as follows. \"The\r\nfirst minister, Mudjed ul Dowlah, is _totally_ deficient in every\r\nmilitary quality, conceited of his own superior talents, and formed to\r\nthe practice of _that crooked policy which, generally defeats its own\r\npurpose_, but sincerely attached to his master.\" The reality of the said\r\nattachment was not improbable, but altogether useless, as the said\r\nminister was the only one among the principal persons about the king who\r\n(besides the total want of all military and civil ability) possessed no\r\nterritories, troops, or other means of serving and supporting him, but\r\nwas himself solely upheld by his influence over his master: neither doth\r\nthe said Hastings free him, any more than the persons more efficient,\r\nwho were to be destroyed, from a disposition to alienate the king from\r\nan attention to his affairs, and from all confidence in his own family;\r\nbut, on the contrary, he brings him forward as the very first among the\r\ninstances he adduces to exemplify the practices of the ministers against\r\ntheir sovereign and his children.\r\n\r\nXVI. That the said Warren Hastings, recommending in general terms, and\r\nyet condemning in detail, every part of his own pretended plan, as\r\nimpracticable in itself, and as undertaken in favor of persons all of\r\nwhom he describes as incapable, and the principal as indisposed to avail\r\nhimself thereof, must have had some other motives for this long,\r\nintricate, dark, and laborious proceeding with the Mogul, which must be\r\nsought in his actions, and the evident drift and tendency thereof, and\r\nin declarations which were brought out by him to serve other purposes,\r\nbut which serve fully to explain his real intentions in this intrigue.\r\n\r\nXVII. That the other members of the Council-General having abundantly\r\ncertified their averseness to his intrigues, and even having shown\r\napprehensions of his going personally to the Mogul and the Mahrattas for\r\nthe purpose of carrying on the same, the said Hastings was driven\r\nheadlong to acts which did much more openly indicate the true nature and\r\npurpose of his machinations. For he at length recurred directly, and\r\nwith little disguise, to the Mahrattas, and did open an intrigue with\r\nthem, although he was obliged to confess, in his letter aforesaid of the\r\n16th June, 1784, that the exception which he contended to be implied in\r\nthe orders of the Court of Directors forbidding the intermeddling in the\r\ndisputes of \"the country powers,\" namely, \"powers not permanent,\" did by\r\nno means apply to the Mahrattas; and he informs the Court of Directors\r\nthat he did, on the very first advice he received of the flight of the\r\nMogul's son, write to Mr. James Anderson to apprise the Mahratta chief,\r\nSindia, of that event,--\"for which as he was unprepared, he desired his\r\n[the said Sindia's] advice for his conduct on the occasion of it.\" Which\r\nmethod of calling for the advice of a foreign power to regulate his\r\npolitical conduct, instead of being regulated therein by the advice of\r\nthe British Council and the standing orders of the Court of Directors,\r\nwas a procedure highly criminal; and the crime is aggravated by his not\r\ncommunicating the said correspondence to the Council-General, as by his\r\nduty he was bound to do; but it does abundantly prove his concert with\r\nthe Mahrattas in all that related to his negotiations in the Mogul\r\ncourt, which were carried on agreeably to their advice, and in\r\nsubserviency to their views and purposes.\r\n\r\nXVIII. That, in consequence of the cabal begun with the Mahrattas, the\r\nsaid chief, Sindia, did send his \"familiar and confidential ministers\"\r\nto him, the said Hastings, being at Lucknow, with whom the said Hastings\r\ndid hold several secret conferences, without any secretary or other\r\nassistant: and the said Hastings hath not conveyed to the Court of\r\nDirectors any minutes thereof, but hath purposely involved even the\r\ngeneral effect and tendency of these conferences in such obscurity that\r\nit is no otherwise possible to perceive the drift and tendency of the\r\nsame, but by the general scope of councils and acts relative to the\r\npolitics of the Mogul and of the Mahrattas together, and by the final\r\nevent of the whole, which is sufficiently visible. For\r\n\r\nXIX. That the said Hastings had declared, in his said letter of the 16th\r\nJune, 1784, that the Mogul's right to our assistance had been constantly\r\nacknowledged, that the Mogul had been oppressed by the lesser Mahomedan\r\nprinces in the character of his officers of state and military\r\ncommanders, and he did plainly intimate that the said Mogul ought to be\r\nrelieved from that servitude. And he did, in giving an account to the\r\nCourt of Directors of the conferences aforesaid, assure them that \"his\r\ninclinations [the inclinations of the Mahratta chief aforesaid] were not\r\nvery dissimilar from his own\"; and that \"neither in this nor in any\r\nother instance would he suffer himself to be drawn into measures which\r\nshall tend to weaken their connection, nor _in this even to oppose his_\r\n[the said chiefs] _inclinations_\": the said Hastings well knowing, as in\r\nhis letter to Colonel Muir of the ---- he has confessed, that the\r\ninclinations of the said Sindia were to seize on the Mogul's\r\nterritories, and that he himself did secretly concur therein, though he\r\ndid not formally insert his concurrence in the treaty with the said\r\nMahratta chief. It is plain, therefore, that he did all along concur\r\nwith the Mahrattas in their designs against the said king and his\r\nministers, under the treacherous pretence of supporting the authority of\r\nthe former against the latter, and did contrive and effect the ruin of\r\nthem all. For, first, he did give evil and fraudulent counsel to the\r\nheir-apparent of the Mogul \"to make advances to the Mahrattas,\" when he\r\nwell knew, and had expressly concurred in, the designs of that state\r\nagainst his father's, the Mogul's, dominions; and further to engage and\r\nentrap the said prince, did assert that \"our government\" (meaning the\r\nBritish government) \"was in intimate and sworn connection with Mahdajee\r\nSindia,\" when no alliance, offensive or defensive, appears to exist\r\nbetween the said Sindia and the East India Company, nor can exist,\r\notherwise than in virtue of some secret agreement between him, the said\r\nSindia, and Warren Hastings, entered into by the latter without the\r\nknowledge of his colleagues and the government, and never communicated\r\nto the Court of Directors. And, secondly, he did, in order to further\r\nthe designs of the Mahrattas, contrive and effect the ruin of the said\r\nMogul and his authority, by setting on foot, through the aforesaid Major\r\nBrowne, sundry perplexed and intricate negotiations, contrary to public\r\nfaith, and to the honor of the British nation; by which he did\r\nexceedingly increase the confusion and disorders of the Mogul's court,\r\nexposing the said Mogul to new indignities, insults, and distresses, and\r\nalmost all of the northern parts of India to great and ruinous\r\nconvulsions, until three out of four of the principal chieftains, some\r\nof them possessing the territories lately belonging to Nudjif Khân, and\r\nmaintaining among them eighty thousand troops of horse and foot, and\r\nsome of which chiefs wore the ministers aforesaid, being cut off by\r\ntheir mutual dissensions, and the fort of Delhi being at length\r\ndelivered to the Mahrattas, the said Sindia became the uncontrolled\r\nruler of the royal army, and the person of the Mogul, with the use of\r\nall his pretensions and claims, fell into the hands of a nation already\r\ntoo powerful, together with an extensive territory, which entirely\r\ncovers the Company's possessions and dependencies on one side, and\r\nparticularly those of the Nabob of Oude.\r\n\r\nXX. That the circumstances of these countries did, in the opinion of the\r\nsaid Warren Hastings himself, sufficiently indicate to him the necessity\r\nof not aggrandizing any power whatsoever on their borders, he having in\r\nthe aforesaid letter of the 16th June given a deliberate opinion of the\r\nsituation of Oude in the words following: \"That, whilst we are at peace\r\nwith the powers of Europe, it is only in this quarter that your\r\npossessions under the government of Bengal are vulnerable.\" And he did\r\nfurther in the said letter state, that, \"if things had continued as they\r\nhad been to that time, with a divided government,\" (viz., the Company's\r\nand the Vizier's, which government he had himself established, and under\r\nwhich it ever must in a great degree remain, whilst the said country\r\ncontinues in a state of dependence,) \"the _slightest_ shock from a\r\nforeign hand, or even an _accidental internal commotion_, might have\r\nthrown the whole into confusion, and produced the most fatal\r\nconsequences.\" In this perilous situation he made the above-recited\r\nsacrifices to the ambition of the Mahrattas, and did all along so\r\nactively countenance and forward their proceedings, and with so full a\r\nsense of their effect, that in his minute of the 24th December, 1784, he\r\nhas declared, \"that in the countries which border on the dominions of\r\nthe Nabob Vizier, or on that quarter of our own, in effect _there is no\r\nother power_.\" And he did further admit, that the presence of the\r\nMahratta chief aforesaid, so near the borders of the Nabob's dominions,\r\nwas no cause of suspicion; for \"that it is the effect _of his own\r\nsolicitation_, and is _so far_ the effect of an act of that government.\"\r\n\r\nXXI. That, in further pursuit of the same pernicious design, he, the\r\nsaid Warren Hastings, did enter into an agreement to withdraw a very\r\ngreat body of the British troops out of the Nabob's\r\ndominions,--asserting, however truly, yet in direct contradiction to his\r\nown declarations, that \"this government\" (meaning the British\r\ngovernment) \"has not any right to force defence with its maintenance\r\nupon him\" (the Nabob); and he did thus not only avowedly aggrandize the\r\nMahratta state, and weaken the defence upon the frontier, but did as\r\navowedly detain their captain-general in force on that very frontier,\r\nnotwithstanding he was well apprised that they had designs against those\r\ndependent territories of Oude, which they had with great difficulty been\r\npersuaded, even in appearance, to include in the treaty of peace,--and\r\nthat they have never renounced their claims upon certain large and\r\nvaluable portions of them, and have shown evident signs of their\r\nintentions, on the first opportunity, of asserting and enforcing them.\r\nAnd, finally, the said Warren Hastings, in contradiction to sundry\r\ndeclarations of his own concerning the necessity of curbing the power of\r\nthe Mahrattas, and to the principle of sundry measures undertaken by\r\nhimself professedly for that purpose, and to the sense of the House of\r\nCommons, expressed in their resolution of 28th May, 1782, against any\r\nmeasures that tended to unite the dangerous powers of the Mahratta\r\nempire under one active command, has endeavored to persuade the Company,\r\nthat, \"while Sindia lives, every accession of territory obtained by him\r\nwill be an advantage to this [the British] government\"; which if it was\r\ntrue as respecting the personal dispositions of Sindia, which there is\r\nno reason to believe, yet it was highly criminal to establish a power in\r\nthe Mahrattas which must survive the man in confidence of whose personal\r\ndispositions a power more than personal was given, and which may\r\nhereafter fall into hands disposed to make a more hostile use of it.\r\n\r\nXXII. That, in consequence of all the before-recited intrigues, the\r\nMogul emperor being in the hands of the Mahrattas, he, the said Mogul,\r\nhas been obliged to declare the head of the Mahratta state to be\r\nvicegerent of the Mogul empire, an authority which supersedes that of\r\nVizier, and has thereby consolidated in the Mahratta state all the\r\npowers acknowledged to be of legal authority in India; in consequence of\r\nwhich, they have acquired, and have actually already attempted to use,\r\nthe said claims of general superiority against the Company itself,--the\r\nMahrattas claiming a right in themselves to a fourth part of the\r\nrevenues of all the provinces in the Company's possession, and claiming,\r\nin right of the Mogul, the tribute due to him: by which actings and\r\ndoings the said Hastings has to the best of his power brought the\r\nBritish provinces in India into a dependence on the Mahratta state: and\r\nin order to add to the aforesaid enormous claims a proportioned force,\r\nhe did never cease, during his stay in India, to contrive the means for\r\nits increase; for it is of public notoriety, that one great object of\r\nthe Mahratta policy is to unite under their dominion the nation or\r\nreligious sect of the Seiks, who, being a people abounding with\r\nsoldiers, and possessing large territories, would extend the Mahratta\r\npower over the whole of the vast countries to the northwest of India.\r\n\r\nXXIII. That the said Warren Hastings, further to augment the power of\r\nthe said Mahrattas, and to endanger the safety of the British\r\npossessions, having established in force the said Mahrattas on the\r\nfrontier, as afore-recited, and finding the Council-General averse in\r\nthat situation to the withdrawing the British forces therefrom, and for\r\ndisbanding them to the extent required by the said Hastings, did, in a\r\nminute of the 4th December, 1784, after stating a supposition, that,\r\ncontrary to his opinion, the said troops should not be reduced, propose\r\nto employ them under the command of the Mogul's son, then under the\r\ninfluence of the Mahrattas, in a war against the aforesaid people or\r\nreligious sect called Seiks, defending the same on the following\r\nprinciples: \"I feel the sense of an obligation, imposed on me by the\r\nsupposition I have made, to state a mode of rendering the detachment of\r\nuse in its prescribed station, and of affording the _appearance_ of a\r\ncause for its retention.\"\r\n\r\nXXIV. That the said Hastings did admit that there was no present danger\r\nto the Company's possessions from that nation which could justify him in\r\nsuch a war, as he had declared that the Mahrattas were _the only power_\r\nthat bordered on the Company's possessions and those of the Vizier; but\r\nhe did assign as a reason for going to war with them their military and\r\nenthusiastic spirit,--the hardiness of their natural constitution,--the\r\ndangers which might arise from them in some future time, if they should\r\never happen to be united under one head, they existing at present in a\r\nstate little different from anarchy; and he did predict great danger\r\nfrom them, and at no very remote period, \"if this people be permitted to\r\ngrow into maturity without interruption.\" And though he doth pretend\r\nthat the solicitations of the heir-apparent of the Mogul, who, he says,\r\ndid repeatedly and earnestly solicit him to obtain the permission to use\r\nthe Company's troops for the purpose aforesaid, had weight with him, yet\r\nhe doth declare, as he expresses himself in the minute aforesaid, that\r\n\"a _stronger impulse_, arising from the hope of _blasting the growth_\r\nof a generation whose strength _might_ become fatal to our own, strongly\r\npleaded in my mind for supporting his wishes.\"\r\n\r\nXXV. That the said Warren Hastings, after forcibly recommending the plan\r\naforesaid, did state strong objections, that did, \"in his judgment,\r\noutweigh the advantages which might arise from a compliance with it.\"\r\nYet the said Hastings, being determined to pursue his scheme for\r\naggrandizing at any rate the Mahratta power, in whose adult growth and\r\nthe recent effects of it he could see no danger, did pursue the design\r\nof war against a nation or sect of religion in its infancy, from whom he\r\nhad received no injury, and in whose present state of government he did\r\nnot apprehend any mischief whatsoever; and finding the Council fixed and\r\ndetermined on not disbanding the frontier regiments, and thinking that\r\ntherein he had found an advantage, he did ground thereon the following\r\nproposition.\r\n\r\n\"If the expense [of the frontier troops] is to be continued, it may be\r\nsurely better continued for some useful purpose than to keep up the\r\nparade of a great military corps designed merely to lie inactive in its\r\nquarters. On this ground, therefore, and on the supposition premised, I\r\nrevert to my original sentiments in favor of the prince's plan; but as\r\nthis will require some qualification in the execution of it, I will\r\nstate my recommendation of it in the terms of a proposition, viz., that,\r\nif it shall be the resolution of the board to continue the detachment\r\nnow under the command of Colonel Sir John Cumming at Furruckabad, and if\r\nthe prince Mirza Jehander Shah shall apply, _with the authority of the\r\nking, and the concurrence of Mahdajee Sindia_, for the assistance of an\r\nEnglish military force, to act in conjunction with him, to expel the\r\nSeiks from the territories of which they have lately possessed\r\nthemselves in the neighborhood of Delhi, it may be granted, and such a\r\nportion of the said detachment allotted to that service as shall be\r\nhereafter judged adequate to it.\"\r\n\r\nXXVI. That the said Warren Hastings did, in the said proposal, endeavor\r\nto circumvent and overreach the Council-General, by converting an\r\napparent and literal compliance with their resolution into a real and\r\nsubstantial opposition to and disappointment thereof. For his first\r\nproposal was, to withdraw the Company's troops from the Vizier's country\r\non the pretence of relieving him from the burden of that establishment,\r\nbut in reality with a view of facilitating the Mahratta pretensions on\r\nthat province, which would then be deprived of the means of defence. And\r\nwhen the Council rejected the said proposal on the express ground of\r\ndanger to the province by withdrawing from the Mahrattas the restraint\r\nof our troops, the said Hastings, finding his first scheme in favor of\r\nthe Mahrattas against the provinces dependent on the Company defeated by\r\nthe refusal of the Council to concur in the said measure of withdrawing\r\nthe troops, did then endeavor to obtain the same purpose in a different\r\nway; and instead of leaving the troops, according to the intention and\r\npolicy of the Council, as a check to the ambition and progress of the\r\nMahrattas, he proposed to employ them in the actual furtherance of those\r\nschemes of aggrandizement of which his colleagues were jealous, and\r\nwhich it was the object of their resolution to counteract.\r\n\r\nXXVII. That, in the whole of the letters, negotiations, proposals, and\r\nprojects of the said Warren Hastings relative to the Mogul, he did\r\nappear to pursue but one object, namely, the aggrandizement of the\r\nlately hostile and always dangerous power of the Mahrattas, and did\r\npursue the same by means highly dishonorable to the British character\r\nfor honor, justice, candor, plain-dealing, moderation, and humanity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX.--LIBEL ON THE COURT OF DIRECTORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. That Warren Hastings, Esquire, was, during the whole of the year\r\n1783, a servant of the East India Company, and was bound by the duties\r\nof that relation not only to yield obedience to the orders of the Court\r\nof Directors, but to give to the whole of their service an example of\r\nsubmission, reverence, and respect to their authority; and that, if they\r\nshould in the course of their duty call in question any part of his\r\nconduct, he was bound to conduct his defence with temper and decency;\r\nand while his conduct was under their consideration, it was not\r\nallowable to print and publish any of his letters to them without their\r\nconsent first had and obtained; and he was bound by the same principles\r\nof duty, enforced by still more cogent reasons, to observe, in a paper\r\nintended for publication, great modesty and moderation, and to treat the\r\nsaid Court of Directors, his lawful masters, with respect.\r\n\r\nII. That the said Warren Hastings did print and publish, or cause to be\r\nprinted and published, at Calcutta in Bengal, the narrative of his\r\ntransactions at Benares, in a letter written at that place, without\r\nleave had of the Court of Directors, in order to preoccupy the judgment\r\nof the servants in that settlement, and to gain from them a factious\r\ncountenance and support, previous to the judgment and opinion of the\r\nCourt of Directors, his lawful superiors.\r\n\r\nIII. That the Court of Directors, having come to certain resolutions of\r\nfact relative to the engagements subsisting between them and the Rajah\r\nof Benares, and the manner in which the same had been fulfilled on the\r\npart of the Rajah, did, in the fifth resolution, which was partly a\r\nresolution of opinion, declare as follows: \"That it appears to this\r\nCourt that the conduct of the Governor-General towards the Rajah, whilst\r\nhe was at Benares, was improper; and that the imprisonment of his\r\nperson, thereby disgracing him in the eyes of his subjects and others,\r\nwas unwarrantable and highly impolitic, and may tend to weaken the\r\nconfidence which the native princes of India ought to have in the\r\njustice and moderation of the Company's government.\"\r\n\r\nIV. That the said resolutions being transmitted to the said Warren\r\nHastings, he, the said Warren Hastings, did write, and cause to be\r\nprinted and published, a certain false, insolent, malicious, and\r\nseditious libel, purporting to be a letter from him, the said Warren\r\nHastings, to the Court of Directors, dated Fort William, 20th March,\r\n1783, \"calculated,\" as the Directors truly affirm, \"to bring contempt,\r\nas well as an odium, on the Court of Directors, for their conduct on\r\nthat occasion\"; and the said libel had a direct tendency to excite a\r\nspirit of disobedience to the lawful government of this nation in India\r\nthrough all ranks of their service.\r\n\r\nV. That he, the said Warren Hastings, among other insolent and\r\ncontumacious charges and aspersions on the Court of Directors, did\r\naddress them in the printed letter aforesaid as follows. \"I deny that\r\nRajah Cheyt Sing was a native prince of India. Cheyt Sing is the son of\r\na collector of the revenue of that province, which his arts, and the\r\nmisfortunes of his master, enabled him to convert to a permanent and\r\nhereditary possession. This man, whom _you have thus ranked among the\r\nprinces_ of India, will be astonished, when he hears it, at an elevation\r\nso unlooked for, nor less at the independent rights which _your_\r\ncommands have assigned him,--rights which are _so foreign to his\r\nconceptions, that I doubt whether he will know in what language to\r\nassert them, unless_ the example which _you have thought it consistent\r\nwith justice, however opposite to policy, to show, of becoming his\r\nadvocates against your own interests, should inspire any of your own\r\nservants to be his advisers and instructors_.\" And he did further, to\r\nbring into contempt the authority of the Company, and to excite a\r\nresistance to their lawful orders, frame a supposition that the Court of\r\nDirectors had intended the restoration of the Rajah of Benares, and on\r\nthat ground did presume in the said libel to calumniate, in\r\ndisrespectful and contumelious terms, the policy of the Court of\r\nDirectors, as well as the person whom he did conceive to be the object\r\nof their protection, as followeth. \"Of the consequences of such a policy\r\nI forbear to speak. _Most happily, the wretch whose hopes may be excited\r\nby the appearances in his favor is ill qualified to avail himself of\r\nthem_, and _the force which is stationed in the province of Benares is\r\nsufficient to suppress any symptoms of internal sedition_; but it cannot\r\nfail to create distrust and suspense in the minds both of the rulers and\r\nof the people, and such a state is always productive of disorder. But it\r\nis not in this partial consideration that I dread the effects of your\r\ncommands; it is in your proclaimed indisposition against the first\r\nexecutive member of your first government in India. I almost shudder at\r\nthe reflection of what might have happened, had these denunciations\r\nagainst your own minister, in favor of a man universally considered in\r\nthis part of the world as justly attainted for his crimes, the murderer\r\nof your servants and soldiers, and the rebel to your authority, arrived\r\ntwo months earlier.\"\r\n\r\nVI. That the said Warren Hastings did also presume to censure and\r\nasperse the Court of Directors for the moderate terms in which they had\r\nexpressed their displeasure against him, as putting him under the\r\nnecessity of stating in his defence a strong accusation against himself,\r\nand as implying in the said Court a consciousness that he was not guilty\r\nof the offences charged upon him,--being, as he asserts, in the\r\nresolutions of the Court of Directors, \"arraigned and prejudged of _a\r\nviolation of national faith, in acts of such complicated aggravation_,\r\nthat, _if they were true_, no punishment SHORT OF DEATH could atone for\r\nthe injury which the interest and credit of the public had sustained in\r\nthem\"; and he did therefore censure the said Court for applying no\r\nstronger or more criminating epithets than those of \"improper,\r\nunwarrantable, and highly impolitic,\" to an offence so by them charged,\r\nand by him described. And though it be true that the expressions\r\naforesaid are much too reserved for the purpose of duly characterizing\r\nthe offences of the said Hastings, yet was it _in him_ most indecent to\r\nlibel the Court of Directors for the same; and his implication, from the\r\ntenderness of the epithets and descriptions aforesaid used towards him,\r\nwas not only indecent, but ungrounded, malicious, and scandalous,--he\r\nhaving himself highly, though truly, aggravated \"the charge of the\r\ninjuries done by him to the Rajah of Benares,\" in order to bring the\r\nsaid Directors into contempt and suspicion, the paragraphs in the said\r\nlibel being as follow.--\"Here I must crave leave to say, that the terms\r\n'improper, unwarrantable, and highly impolitic' are much too gentle, as\r\ndeductions from such premises; and as every reader of the latter will\r\nobviously feel, as he reads, the deductions which inevitably belong to\r\nthem, I will add, that the strict performance of solemn engagements on\r\none part, followed by acts directly subversive of them and by total\r\ndispossession on the other, stamps on the perpetrators of the latter the\r\nguilt of the greatest possible violation of faith and justice.\"--\"There\r\nis an appearance of tenderness in this deviation from plain\r\nconstruction, of which, however meant, I have a right to complain;\r\nbecause it imposes on me the necessity of framing the terms of the\r\naccusation against myself, which you have only not made, but have stated\r\nthe leading arguments to it so strongly, that no one who reads these can\r\navoid making it, _or not know it to have been intended_.\"\r\n\r\nVII. That the said Hastings, being well aware that his own declarations\r\ndid contain the clearest condemnation of his own conduct from his own\r\npen, did in the said libel attempt to overturn, frustrate, and render of\r\nnone effect all the proofs to be given of prevarication, contradiction,\r\nand of opposition of action to principle, which can be used against men\r\nin public trust, and did contend that the same could not be used against\r\nhim; and as if false assertions could be justified by factious motives,\r\nhe did endeavor to do away the authority of his own _deliberate,\r\nrecorded_ declarations, entered by him _in writing_ on the Council-Books\r\nof the Presidency; for, after asserting, _but not attempting to prove_,\r\nthat his declarations were consistent with his conduct, he writes in the\r\nsaid libel as follows: For \"were it otherwise, they were not to be made\r\nthe rules of my conduct; and God forbid that every expression dictated\r\nby the impulse of present emergency, and unpremeditatedly uttered in the\r\nheat of party contention, should impose upon me the obligation of a\r\nfixed principle, and be applied to every variable occasion!\"\r\n\r\nVIII. That the said Hastings, in order to draw the lawful dependence of\r\nthe servants of the Company from the Court of Directors to a factious\r\ndependence on himself, did, in the libel aforesaid, treat the acts and\r\nappointments of their undoubted authority, when exercised in opposition\r\nto his arbitrary will, as ruinous to their affairs, in the following\r\nterms. \"It is as well known to the Indian world as to the Court of\r\nEnglish Proprietors, that the first declaratory instruments of the\r\ndissolution of my influence, in the year 1774, were Mr. John Bristow and\r\nMr. Francis Fowke. By your ancient and known constitution the Governor\r\nhas been ever held forth and understood to possess the ostensible\r\npowers of government; all the correspondence with foreign princes is\r\nconducted in his name; and every person resident with them for the\r\nmanagement of your political concerns is understood to be _more\r\nespecially his_ representative, and of _his_ choice: and such ought to\r\nbe the rule; for how otherwise can they trust an agent nominated against\r\nthe will of _his_ principal? When the state of this administration was\r\nsuch as seemed to _admit of_ the appointment of Mr. Bristow to the\r\nResidency of Lucknow without _much_ diminution of _my own_ influence, I\r\ngladly seized the occasion to show my readiness to submit to your\r\ncommands; I proposed his nomination; he was nominated, and declared to\r\n_be the agent of my own choice_. Even this effect of my caution _is\r\ndefeated by your absolute command for his reappointment independent of\r\nme, and with the supposition that I should be adverse to it_.--I am now\r\nwholly deprived of my official powers, both in the province of Oude, and\r\nin the zemindary of Benares.\"\r\n\r\nIX. That, further to emancipate others and himself from due obedience to\r\nthe Court of Directors, he did, in the libel aforesaid, enhance his\r\nservices, which, without specification or proof, he did suppose in the\r\nsaid libel to be important and valuable, by representing them as done\r\nunder their displeasure, and doth attribute his not having done more to\r\ntheir opposition, as followeth. \"It is now a complete period of eleven\r\nyears since I first received the first nominal charge of your affairs;\r\nin the course of it I have _invariably_ had to contend, not with\r\nordinary difficulties, but such as most _unnaturally_ arose _from the\r\nopposition of those very powers from which I primarily derived my\r\nauthority, and which were required for the support of it_. My exertions,\r\nthough applied to an unvaried and consistent line of action, have been\r\noccasional and desultory; yet I please myself with the hope, that, in\r\nthe annals of your dominion, which shall be written after the extinction\r\nof recent prejudices, this term of its administration will appear not\r\nthe least conducive to the interests of the Company, nor the least\r\nreflective of the honor of the British name: and allow me to suggest the\r\ninstructive reflection of _what good might have been done, and what evil\r\nprevented, had due support been given to that administration which has\r\nperformed such eminent and substantial services without it_.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the said Hastings, further to render the authority of the said Court\r\nperfectly contemptible, doth, in a strain of exultation for his having\r\nescaped out of a measure in which by his guilt he had involved the\r\nCompany in a ruinous war, and out of which it had escaped by a sacrifice\r\nof almost all the territories before acquired (from that enemy which he\r\nhad made) either by war or former treaties, and by the abandoning the\r\nCompany's allies to their mercy, attribute the said supposed services to\r\nhis acting in such a manner as had on former occasions excited their\r\ndispleasure, in the following words. \"Pardon, Honorable Sirs, this\r\ndigressive exultation. I cannot suppress the pride which I feel in this\r\nsuccessful achievement of a measure so fortunate for your interests and\r\nthe national honor; for that pride is the source of my zeal, so\r\nfrequently exerted in your support, and never more happily than in those\r\ninstances _in which I have departed from the prescribed and beaten path\r\nof action, and assumed a responsibility which has too frequently drawn\r\non me the most pointed effects of your displeasure_. But however I may\r\nyield to my private feelings in thus enlarging on the subject, my motive\r\nin introducing it was immediately connected with its context, and was to\r\ncontrast _the actual state of your political affairs, derived from a\r\nhappier influence, with that which might have attended an earlier\r\ndissolution of it_\": and he did value himself upon \"the _patience_ and\r\ntemper with which he had submitted to all the indignities which have\r\nbeen heaped upon him\" (meaning, by the said Court of Directors) \"in this\r\nlong service\"; and he did insolently attribute to an unusual strain of\r\nzeal for their service, that he \"_persevered_ in the VIOLENT MAINTENANCE\r\nOF HIS OFFICE.\"\r\n\r\nX. That, in order further to excite the spirit of disobedience in the\r\nCompany's servants to the lawful authority set over them, he, the said\r\nWarren Hastings, did treat contemptuously and ironically the supposed\r\ndisposition of the Company's servants to obey the orders of the Court of\r\nDirectors, in the words following. \"The recall of Mr. Markham, who was\r\nknown to be the public agent of my own nomination at Benares, and the\r\nreappointment of Mr. Francis Fowke by your order, contained in the same\r\nletter, would place it [the restoration of Cheyt Sing] beyond a doubt.\r\n_This order has been obeyed; and whenever you shall be pleased to order\r\nthe restoration of Cheyt Sing, I will venture to promise the same ready\r\nand exact submission in the other members of the Council._\" And he did,\r\nin the postscript of the said letter, and as on recollection, endeavor\r\nto make a reparation of honor to his said colleagues, as if his\r\nexpressions aforesaid had arisen from animosity to them, as follows.\r\n\"Upon a careful revisal of what I have written, I fear that an\r\nexpression which I have used, respecting the probable conduct of the\r\nboard in the event of orders being received for the restoration of Cheyt\r\nSing, may be construed as intimating a sense of dissatisfaction applied\r\nto transactions already past.--It is not my intention to complain of any\r\none.\"\r\n\r\nXI. That the said Hastings, in the acts of injury aforesaid to the Rajah\r\nof Benares, did assume and arrogate to himself an illegal authority\r\ntherein, and did maintain that the acts done in consequence of that\r\nmeasure were not revocable by any subsequent authority, in the following\r\nwords. \"If you should proceed to order the restoration of Cheyt Sing to\r\nthe zemindary, from which, _by the powers which I legally possessed_,\r\nand conceive myself legally _bound to assert_ against any _subsequent\r\nauthority to the contrary_ derived from _the same common source_, he was\r\ndispossessed for crimes of the greatest enormity, and your Council shall\r\nresolve to execute the order, I will instantly give up my station and\r\nthe service.\"\r\n\r\nXII. That the said Warren Hastings did attempt to justify his\r\npublication of the said libellous letter to and against the Court of\r\nDirectors by asserting therein that these resolutions (meaning the\r\nresolutions of the Court of Directors relative to the Rajah of Benares)\r\n\"were _either_ published or _intended_ for publication\": evidently\r\nproving that he did take this unwarrantable course without any\r\nsufficient assurance that the ground and motive by him assigned had any\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX.--MAHRATTA WAR AND PEACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. That by an act passed in 1773 it was expressly ordered and provided,\r\n\"that it should not be lawful for any President and Council of Madras,\r\nBombay, or Bencoolen, for the time being, to make any orders for\r\ncommencing hostilities, or declaring or making war, against any Indian\r\nprinces or powers, or for negotiating or concluding any treaty of peace,\r\nor other treaty, with any such Indian princes or powers, without the\r\nconsent and approbation of the Governor-General and Council first had\r\nand obtained, except in such cases of _imminent necessity_ as would\r\nrender it dangerous to postpone such hostilities or treaties until the\r\norders from the Governor-General and Council might arrive.\" That,\r\nnevertheless, the President and Council of Bombay did, in December,\r\n1774, without the consent and approbation of the Governor-General and\r\nCouncil of Fort William, and in the midst of profound peace, commence an\r\nunjust and unprovoked war against the Mahratta government, did conclude\r\na treaty with a certain person, a fugitive from that government, and\r\nproscribed by it, named Ragonaut Row, or Ragoba, and did, under various\r\nbase and treacherous pretences, invade and conquer the island of\r\nSalsette, belonging to the Mahratta government.\r\n\r\nII. That Warren Hastings, on the first advices received in Bengal of the\r\nabove transactions, did condemn the same in the strongest\r\nterms,--declaring that \"the measures adopted by the Presidency of Bombay\r\nhad a tendency to a very extensive and indefinite scene of troubles, and\r\nthat their conduct was unseasonable, impolitic, unjust, and\r\nunauthorized.\" And the Governor-General and Council, in order to put a\r\nstop to the said unjust hostilities, did appoint an ambassador to the\r\nPeshwa, or chief of the Mahratta state, resident at Poonah; and the said\r\nambassador did, after a long negotiation, conclude a definitive treaty\r\nof peace with the said Peshwa on terms highly honorable and beneficial\r\nto the East India Company, who by the said treaty obtained from the\r\nMahrattas a cession of considerable tracts of country, the Mahratta\r\nshare of the city of Baroach, twelve lacs of rupees for the expenses of\r\nthe said unjust war, and particularly the island of Salsette, of which\r\nthe Presidency of Bombay had possessed themselves by surprise and\r\ntreachery. That, in return for these extraordinary concessions, the\r\narticles principally insisted on by the Mahrattas, with a view to their\r\nown future tranquillity and internal quiet, were, that _no assistance\r\nshould he given to any subject or servant of the Peshwa that should\r\ncause disturbances or rebellion in the Mahratta dominions_, and\r\nparticularly that the English _should not assist Ragonaut Row_, to whom\r\nthe Mahrattas agreed to allow five lacs of rupees a year, or a jaghire\r\nto that amount, and that he should reside at Benares. That,\r\nnevertheless, the Presidency of Bombay did receive and keep Ragonaut Row\r\nat Bombay, did furnish him with a considerable establishment, and\r\ncontinue to carry on secret intrigues and negotiations with him, thereby\r\ngiving just ground of jealousy and distrust to the Mahratta state. That\r\nthe late Colonel John Upton, by whom the treaty of Poorunder was\r\nnegotiated and concluded, did declare to the Governor-General and\r\nCouncil, \"that, while Ragonaut Row resides at Bombay in expectation of\r\nbeing supported, the ministers can place no confidence in the Council\r\nthere, which must now be productive of the greatest inconveniencies, and\r\nperhaps in the end of fatal consequences.\" That the said Warren\r\nHastings, concurring with his Council, which then consisted of Sir John\r\nClavering, Richard Barwell, and Philip Francis, Esquires, did, on the\r\n18th of August, 1777, declare to the Presidency of Bombay, that \"he\r\ncould see no reason to doubt that the presence of Ragoba at Bombay would\r\ncontinue to be _an insuperable bar_ to the completion of the treaty\r\nconcluded with the Mahratta government; nor could any sincere cordiality\r\nand good understanding be established with them, as long as he should\r\nappear to derive encouragement and support from the English.\" That Sir\r\nJohn Clavering died soon after, and that the late Edward Wheler,\r\nEsquire, succeeded to a seat in the Supreme Council. That on the 29th of\r\nJanuary, 1778, the Governor-General and Council received a letter from\r\nthe Presidency of Bombay, dated 12th December, 1777, in which they\r\ndeclared, \"that they had agreed to give encouragement to a _party_\r\nformed in Ragoba's favor, and flattered themselves they should meet with\r\nthe hearty concurrence of the Governor-General and Council in the\r\nmeasures they might be obliged to pursue in consequence.\" That the\r\n_party_ so described was said to consist of four principal persons in\r\nthe Mahratta state, on whose part _some overtures_ had been made to Mr.\r\nWilliam Lewis, the Resident of Bombay at Poonah, _for the assistance of\r\nthe Company to bring Ragoba to Poonah_. That the said Warren Hastings,\r\nimmediately on the receipt of the preceding advices, did propose and\r\ncarry it in Council, by means of his casting voice, and against the\r\nremonstrances, arguments, and solemn protest of two members of the\r\nSupreme Council, that the _sanction_ of that government should be given\r\nto the plan which the President and Council of Bombay had agreed to form\r\nwith the Mahratta government; and also that a supply of money (to the\r\namount of ten lacs of rupees) should be immediately granted to the\r\nPresident and Council of Bombay _for the support of their engagements\r\nabove mentioned_; and also that a military force should be sent to the\r\nPresidency of Bombay. That in defence of these resolutions the said\r\nWarren Hastings did falsely pretend and affirm, \"that the resolution of\r\nthe Presidency of Bombay was formed on such a case of _imminent\r\nnecessity_ as would have rendered it dangerous to postpone the execution\r\nof it until the orders from the Governor-General and Council might\r\narrive; and that the said Presidency of Bombay _were warranted by the\r\ntreaty of Poorunder_ to join in a plan for conducting Ragonaut Row to\r\nPoonah on the application of the ruling part of the Mahratta state\":\r\nwhereas the main object of the said treaty on the part of the Mahrattas,\r\nand to obtain which they made many important concessions to the India\r\nCompany, was, that the English should withdraw their forces, and give no\r\nassistance to Ragoba, and that he should be excluded forever from any\r\nshare in their government, being a person _universally held in\r\nabhorrence_ in the Mahratta empire; and if it had been true (instead of\r\nbeing, as it was, notoriously false) that _the ruling part_ of the\r\nadministration of the Mahratta state solicited the return of Ragonaut\r\nRow to Poonah, his return in that case might have been effected by acts\r\nof their own, without the interposition of the English power, and\r\nwithout our interference in their affairs. That it was the special duty\r\nof the said Warren Hastings, derived from a special trust reposed in him\r\nand power committed to him by Parliament, to have restrained, as by law\r\nhe had authority to do, the subordinate Presidency of Bombay from\r\nentering into hostilities with the Mahrattas, or from making engagements\r\nthe manifest tendency of which was to enter into those hostilities, and\r\nto have put a stop to them, if any such had been begun; that he was\r\nbound by the duty of his office to preserve the faith of the British\r\ngovernment, pledged in the treaty of Poorunder, inviolate and sacred, as\r\nwell as by the special orders and instructions of the East India Company\r\n_to fix his attention to the preservation of peace throughout India_:\r\nall which important duties the said Warren Hastings did wilfully\r\nviolate, in giving the _sanction_ of the Governor-General and Council to\r\nthe dangerous, faithless, and ill-concerted projects of the President\r\nand Council of Bombay hereinbefore mentioned, from which the subsequent\r\nMahratta war, with all the expense, distress, and disgraces which have\r\nattended it, took their commencement; and that the said Warren Hastings,\r\ntherefore, is specially and principally answerable for the said war, and\r\nfor all the consequences thereof. That in a letter dated the 20th of\r\nJanuary, 1778, the President and Council of Bombay informed the\r\nGovernor-General and Council, that, in consequence of later intelligence\r\nreceived from Poonah, they had _immediately resolved that nothing\r\nfurther could be done, unless Saccaram Baboo, the principal in the late\r\ntreaty_ (of Poorunder) _joined in making a formal application to them_.\r\nThat no such application was ever made by that person. That the said\r\nWarren Hastings, finding that all this pretended ground for engaging in\r\nan invasion of the Mahratta government had totally failed, did then\r\npretend to give credit to, and to be greatly alarmed by, the suggestions\r\nof the President and Council of Bombay, that the Mahrattas were\r\nnegotiating with the French, and had agreed to give them the port of\r\nChoul, on the Malabar coast, and did affirm that the French _had\r\nobtained possession of that port_. That all these suggestions and\r\nassertions were false, and, if they had been true, would have furnished\r\nno just occasion for attacking either the Mahrattas or the French, with\r\nboth of whom the British nation was then at peace. That the said Warren\r\nHastings did then propose and carry the following resolution in Council,\r\nagainst the protest of two members thereof, that, \"for the purpose of\r\ngranting you [the Presidency of Bombay] the most effectual support in\r\nour power, we have resolved to assemble a strong military force near\r\nCalpee, the commanding officer of which is to be ordered to march by the\r\nmost practicable route to Bombay, or to such other place as future\r\noccurrences and your directions to him may render it expedient\"; and\r\nwith respect to the _steps_ said to be taking _by the French to obtain a\r\nsettlement on the Malabar coast_, the said Warren Hastings did declare\r\nto the Presidency of Bombay, \"that it was the opinion of the\r\nGovernor-General and Council that no time ought to be lost in forming\r\nand carrying into execution such measures as might most effectually tend\r\nto frustrate such dangerous designs.\" That the said Warren Hastings,\r\ntherefore, instead of fixing his attention to the preservation of peace\r\nthroughout India, as it was his duty to have done, did continue to abet,\r\nencourage, and support the dangerous projects of the Presidency of\r\nBombay, and did thereby manifest a determined intention to disturb the\r\npeace of India, by the unfortunate success of which intention, and by\r\nthe continued efforts of the said Hastings, the greatest part of India\r\nhas been for several years involved in a bloody and calamitous war. That\r\nboth the Court of Directors and Court of Proprietors did specially\r\ninstruct the said Warren Hastings, in all his measures, \"to make the\r\nsafety and prosperity of Bengal his principal object,\" and did heavily\r\ncensure the said Warren Hastings for having employed their troops at a\r\ngreat distance from Bengal in a war against the Rohillas, which the\r\nHouse of Commons have pronounced to be _iniquitous_,[17] and did on that\r\noccasion expressly declare, \"that they disapproved of all such distant\r\nexpeditions as might eventually carry their forces to any situation too\r\nremote to admit of their speedy and safe return to the protection of\r\ntheir own provinces, in case of emergency.\"[18] That the said Warren\r\nHastings nevertheless ordered a detachment from the Bengal army to cross\r\nthe Jumna, and to proceed across the peninsula by a circuitous route\r\nthrough the diamond country of Bundelcund, and through the dominions of\r\nthe Rajah of Berar, situated in the centre of Hindostan, and did thereby\r\nstrip the provinces subject to the government of Fort William of a\r\nconsiderable part of their established defence, and did thereby disobey\r\nthe general instructions and positive orders of the Court of Directors,\r\n(given upon occasion of a crime of the same nature committed by the said\r\nHastings,) and was guilty of a high crime and misdemeanor.\r\n\r\nThat the said Warren Hastings, having taken the measures hereinbefore\r\ndescribed for supporting those of the Presidency of Bombay, did, on the\r\n23d of March, 1778, \"invest the said Presidency with authority to form\r\na new alliance with Ragoba, and to engage with him in _any_ scheme which\r\nthey should deem expedient and safe for retrieving his affairs.\" That\r\nthe said Hastings was then in possession of a letter from the Court of\r\nDirectors, dated the 4th of July, 1777, containing a positive order to\r\nthe Presidency of Bombay in the following words. \"Though that treaty\"\r\n(meaning the treaty of Poorunder) \"is not, upon the whole, so agreeable\r\nto us as we could wish, still we are resolved strictly to adhere to it\r\non our parts. You must therefore be particularly vigilant, while Ragoba\r\nis with you, to prevent him from forming any plan against what is called\r\nthe ministerial party at Poonah; and we hereby positively order you not\r\nto engage with him in any scheme whatever in retrieving his affairs,\r\nwithout the consent of the Governor-General and Council, or the Court of\r\nDirectors.\" That the said Ragoba neither did or could form any plan for\r\nhis restoration but what was and must be against the ministerial party\r\nat Poonah, who held and exercised the regency of that state in the\r\ninfancy of the Peshwa; and that, supposing him to have formed any other\r\n_scheme_, in conjunction with Bombay, _for retrieving his affairs_, the\r\nsaid Hastings, in giving a previous _general_ authority to the\r\nPresidency of Bombay to engage with Ragoba in _any_ scheme for that\r\npurpose, without knowing what such scheme might be, and thereby\r\nrelinquishing and transferring to the discretion of a subordinate\r\ngovernment that superintendence and control over all measures tending to\r\ncreate or provoke a war which the law had exclusively vested in the\r\nGovernor-General and Council, was guilty of a high crime and\r\nmisdemeanor.\r\n\r\nThat the said Warren Hastings, having first declared that the measures\r\ntaken by him were for the support of the engagements made by the\r\nPresidency of Bombay in favor of Ragoba, did afterwards, when it\r\nappeared that those negotiations were _entirely laid aside_, declare\r\nthat his apprehension of the consequence of a pretended _intrigue_\r\nbetween the Mahrattas and the French _was the sole motive of all the\r\nlate measures taken for the support of the Presidency of Bombay_; but\r\nthat neither of the preceding declarations contained the true motives\r\nand objects of the said Hastings, whose real purpose, as it appeared\r\nsoon after, was, to make use of the superiority of the British power in\r\nIndia to carry on offensive wars, and to pursue schemes of conquest,\r\nimpolitic and unjust in their design, ill-concerted in the execution,\r\nand which, as this House has resolved, _have brought great calamities on\r\nIndia, and enormous expenses on the East India Company_.\r\n\r\nThat the said Warren Hastings, on the 22d of June, 1778, made the\r\nfollowing declaration in Council. \"Much less can I agree, that, with\r\nsuch superior advantages as we possess over every power which can oppose\r\nus, we should act _merely on the defensive_. On the contrary, if it be\r\nreally true that the British arms and influence have suffered so severe\r\na check in the Western world, it is more incumbent on those who are\r\ncharged with the interests of Great Britain in the East _to exert\r\nthemselves for the retrieval of the national loss_. We have the means in\r\nour power, and, if they are not frustrated by our own dissensions, I\r\ntrust that the event of this expedition will yield every advantage _for\r\nthe attainment of which it was undertaken_.\"\r\n\r\nThat, in pursuance of the principles avowed in the preceding\r\ndeclaration, the said Warren Hastings, on the 9th of July, 1778, did\r\npropose and carry it in Council, that an embassy should be sent from\r\nBengal to Moodajee Boosla, the Rajah of Berar,--falsely asserting that\r\nthe said Rajah \"was, by interest and inclination, likely to join in an\r\nalliance with the British government, and suggesting that two advantages\r\nmight be offered to him as the inducements to it: first, the support of\r\nhis pretensions to the sovereign power\" (viz., of the Mahratta empire);\r\n\"second, the recovery of the captures made on his dominions by Nizam\r\nAli.\" That the said Hastings, having already given full authority to the\r\nPresidency of Bombay to engage the British faith to Ragonaut Row to\r\nsupport him in _his_ pretensions to the government or to the regency of\r\nthe Mahratta empire, was guilty of a high crime and misdemeanor in\r\nproposing to engage the same British faith to support the pretensions of\r\nanother competitor for the same object; and that, in offering to assist\r\nthe Rajah of Berar to recover the captures made on his dominions by the\r\nNizam, the said Hastings did endeavor, as far as depended on him, to\r\nengage the British nation in a most unjust and utterly unprovoked war\r\nagainst the said Nizam, between whom and the East India Company a treaty\r\nof peace and friendship did then subsist, unviolated on his\r\npart,--notwithstanding the said Hastings well knew that it made part of\r\nthe East India Company's fundamental policy to support that prince\r\nagainst the Mahrattas, and _to consider him as one of the few remaining\r\nchiefs who were yet capable of coping with the Mahrattas_, and that it\r\nwas the Company's _true interest to preserve a good understanding with\r\nhim_. That, by holding out such offers to the Rajah of Berar, the said\r\nHastings professed to hope that the Rajah _would ardently catch at the\r\nobjects presented to his ambition_: and although the said Hastings did\r\nabout this time lay it down as a maxim that _there is always a greater\r\nadvantage in receiving solicitations than in making advances_, he\r\nnevertheless declared to the said Rajah that _in the whole of his\r\nconduct he had departed from the common line of policy, and had made\r\nadvances where others in his situation would have waited for\r\nsolicitation_. That the said unjust and dangerous projects did not take\r\neffect, because the Rajah of Berar refused to join or be concerned\r\ntherein; yet so earnest was the said Hastings for the execution of those\r\nprojects, that in a subsequent letter he daringly and treacherously\r\nassured the Rajah, \"that, if he had accepted of the terms offered him by\r\nColonel Goddard, and concluded a treaty with the government of Bengal\r\nupon them, he should have held the obligation of it superior to that of\r\nany engagement formed by the government of Bombay, and should have\r\nthought it his duty to maintain it, &c., against every consideration\r\n_even of the most valuable interests and safety of the English\r\npossessions intrusted to his charge_.\" That all the offers of the said\r\nHastings were rejected with slight and contempt by the Rajah of Berar;\r\nbut the same being discovered, and generally known throughout India, did\r\nfill the chief of the princes and states of India with a general\r\nsuspicion and distrust of the ambitious designs and treacherous\r\nprinciples of the British government, and with an universal hatred of\r\nthe British nation. That the said princes and states were thereby so\r\nthoroughly convinced of the necessity of uniting amongst themselves to\r\noppose a power which kept no faith with any of them, and equally\r\nthreatened them all, that, renouncing all former enmities against each\r\nother, they united in a common confederacy against the English, viz.:\r\nthe Peshwa, as representative of the Mahratta state, and Moodajee\r\nBoosla, the Rajah of Berar, that is, the principal Hindoo powers of\r\nIndia, on one side; and Hyder Ali, and the Nizam of the Deccan, that is,\r\nthe principal Mahomedan powers of India, on the other: and that in\r\nconsequence of this confederacy Hyder Ali invaded, overran, and ruined\r\nthe Carnatic; and that Moodajee Boosla, instead of _ardently catching at\r\nthe objects presented to his ambition_ by the said Hastings, sent an\r\narmy to the frontiers of Bengal,--which army the said Warren Hastings\r\nwas at length forced to buy off with twenty-six lacs of rupees, or\r\n300,000_l._ sterling, after a series of negotiations with the Mahratta\r\nchiefs who commanded that army, founded and conducted on principles so\r\ndishonorable to the British name and character, that the Secret\r\nCommittee of the House of Commons, by whom the rest of the proceedings\r\nin that business were reported to the House, _have upon due\r\nconsideration thought it proper to leave out the letter of instructions\r\nto Mr. Anderson_, viz., those given by the said Warren Hastings to the\r\nrepresentative of the British government, and concerning which the said\r\ncommittee have reported in the following terms: \"The schemes of policy\r\nby which the Governor-General seems to have dictated the instructions he\r\ngave to Mr. Anderson\" (the gentleman deputed) \"will also appear in this\r\ndocument, as well respecting the particular succession to the _rauje_,\r\nas also the mode of accommodating the demand of _chout_, the\r\nestablishment of which was apparently the great aim of Moodajee's\r\npolitical manoeuvres, while the Governor-General's wish to defeat it was\r\navowedly more intent on the removal of a nominal disgrace than on the\r\nanxiety or resolution to be freed from an expensive, if an unavoidable\r\nincumbrance.\"\r\n\r\nThat, while the said Warren Hastings was endeavoring to persuade the\r\nRajah of Berar to engage with him in a scheme to place the said Rajah at\r\nthe head of the Mahratta empire, the Presidency of Bombay, by virtue of\r\nthe powers specially vested in them for that purpose by the said\r\nHastings, did really engage with Ragonaut Row, the other competitor for\r\nthe same object, and sent a great part of their military force,\r\nestablished for the defence of Bombay, on an expedition with Ragonaut\r\nRow, to invade the dominions of the Peshwa, and to take Poonah, the\r\ncapital thereof; that this army, being surrounded and overpowered by the\r\nMahrattas, was obliged to capitulate; and then, through the moderation\r\nof the Mahrattas, was permitted to return quietly, but _very\r\ndisgracefully_, to Bombay. That, supposing the said Warren Hastings\r\ncould have been justified in abandoning the project of reinstating\r\nRagonaut Row, which he at first authorized and promised to support, and\r\nin preferring a scheme to place the Rajah of Berar at the head of the\r\nMahratta empire, he was bound by his duty, as well as injustice to the\r\nPresidency of Bombay, to give that Presidency timely notice of such his\r\nintention, and to have restrained them positively from resuming their\r\nown project; that, on the contrary, the said Warren Hastings did, on the\r\n17th of August, 1778, again _authorize_ the said Presidency \"to assist\r\nRagoba with a military force to conduct him to Poonah, and to establish\r\nhim in the regency there,\" and, so far from communicating his change of\r\nplan to Bombay, did keep it concealed from that Presidency, insomuch\r\nthat, even so late as the 19th of February, 1779, William Hornby, then\r\nGovernor of Bombay, declared in Council his total ignorance of the\r\nschemes of the said Hastings in the following terms: \"The schemes of the\r\nGovernor-General and Council with regard to the Rajah of Berar _being\r\nyet unknown to us_, it is impossible for us to found any measures on\r\nthem; yet I cannot help now observing, that, if, as has been\r\nconjectured, the gentleman of that Presidency have entertained thoughts\r\nof restoring, in his person, the ancient Rajah government, the attempt\r\nseems likely to be attended with no small difficulty.\" That, whereas the\r\nsaid Warren Hastings did repeatedly affirm that it was his intention to\r\nsupport the plan formed by the Presidency of Bombay in favor of Ragoba,\r\nand did repeatedly authorize and encourage them to pursue it, he did\r\nnevertheless, at the same time, in his letters and declarations to the\r\nPeshwa, to the Nizam, and to the Rajah of Berar, falsely and\r\nperfidiously affirm, _that it never was nor is designed by the English\r\nchiefs to give support to Ragonaut Row,--that he_ (Hastings) _had no\r\nidea of supporting Ragonaut Row,--and that the detachment he had sent to\r\nBombay was solely to awe the French, without the least design to assist\r\nRagonaut Row_. That, supposing it to have been the sole _professed_\r\nintention of the said Hastings, in sending an army across India, to\r\nprotect Bombay against a Trench invasion, even that pretence was false,\r\nand used only to cover the real design of the said Hastings, viz., to\r\nengage in projects of war and conquest with the Rajah of Berar. That on\r\nthe 11th of October, 1778, he informed the said Rajah \"that the\r\ndetachment would soon arrive in his territories, and depend on him\r\n[Moodajee Boosla] for its subsequent operations\"; that on the 7th of\r\nDecember, 1778, the said Hastings revoked the powers he had before\r\ngiven[19] to the Presidency of Bombay over the detachment, declaring\r\nthat the event of Colonel Goddard's negotiation with the Rajah of Berar\r\n_was likely to cause a very speedy and essential change in the design\r\nand operations of the detachment_; and that on the 4th of March, 1779,\r\nthe said Hastings, immediately after receiving advice of the defeat of\r\nthe Bombay army near Poonah, and when Bombay, if at any time,\r\nparticularly required to be protected against a French invasion, did\r\ndeclare in Council that he _wished for the return of the detachment to\r\nBerar, and dreaded to hear of its proceeding to the Malabar coast_: and\r\ntherefore, if the said Hastings did not think that Bombay was in danger\r\nof being attacked by the French, he was guilty of repeated falsehoods in\r\naffirming the contrary for the purpose of covering a criminal design;\r\nor, if he thought that Bombay was immediately threatened with that\r\ndanger, he then was guilty of treachery in ordering an army necessary on\r\nthat supposition to the immediate defence of Bombay to halt in Berar, to\r\ndepend on the Rajah of Berar for its subsequent operations, or on _the\r\nevent of a negotiation_ with that prince, which, as the said Hastings\r\ndeclared, _was likely to cause a very speedy and essential change in the\r\ndesign and operations of the detachment_; and finally, in declaring that\r\n_he dreaded to hear of the said detachment's proceeding to the Malabar\r\ncoast_, whither he ought to have ordered it to proceed without delay,\r\nif, as he has solemnly affirmed, it was true that _he had been told by\r\nthe highest authority that a powerful armament had been prepared in\r\nFrance, the first object of which was an attack upon Bombay, and that\r\nhe knew with moral certainty that all the powers of the adjacent\r\ncontinent were ready to join the invasion_.\r\n\r\nThat through the whole of these transactions the said Warren Hastings\r\nhas been guilty of continued falsehood, fraud, contradiction, and\r\nduplicity, highly dishonorable to the character of the British nation;\r\nthat, in consequence of the unjust and ill-concerted schemes of the said\r\nHastings, the British arms, heretofore respected in India, have suffered\r\nrepeated disgraces, and great calamities have been thereby brought upon\r\nIndia; and that the said Warren Hastings, as well in exciting and\r\npromoting the late unprovoked and unjustifiable war against the\r\nMahrattas, as in the conduct thereof, has been guilty of sundry high\r\ncrimes and misdemeanors.\r\n\r\nThat, by the definitive treaty of peace concluded with the Mahrattas at\r\nPoorunder, on the 1st of March, 1776, the Mahrattas gave up all right\r\nand title to the island of Salsette, unjustly taken from them by the\r\nPresidency of Bombay; did also give up to the English Company forever\r\nall right and title to their entire shares of the city and purgunnah of\r\nBaroach; did also give forever to the English Company a country of three\r\nlacs of rupees revenue, near to Baroach; and did also agree to pay to\r\nthe Company twelve lacs of rupees, in part of the expenses of the\r\nEnglish army: and that the terms of the said treaty _were honorable and\r\nadvantageous to the India Company_.[20]\r\n\r\nThat Warren Hastings, having broken the said treaty, and forced the\r\nMahrattas into another war by a repeated invasion of their country, and\r\nhaving conducted that war in the manner hereinbefore described, did, on\r\nthe 17th of May, 1782, by the agency of Mr. David Anderson, conclude\r\nanother treaty of perpetual friendship and alliance with the Mahrattas,\r\nby which the said Hastings agreed to deliver up to them all the\r\ncountries, places, cities, and forts, particularly the island of\r\nBassein, (taken from the Peshwa during the war,) and to relinquish all\r\nclaim to the country of three lacs of rupees ceded to the Company by the\r\ntreaty of Poorunder; that the said Warren Hastings did also at the said\r\ntime, by a private and separate agreement, deliver up to Mahdajee Sindia\r\nthe whole of the city of Baroach,--that is, not only the share in the\r\nsaid city which the India Company acquired by the treaty of Poorunder,\r\nbut the other share thereof which the India Company possessed for\r\nseveral years before that treaty; and that among the reasons assigned by\r\nMr. David Anderson for totally stripping the Presidency of Bombay of all\r\ntheir possessions on the Malabar coast, he has declared, \"that, from the\r\ngeneral tenor of the _rest_ of the treaty, the settlement of Bombay\r\nwould be in future put on such a footing that it might well become a\r\nquestion whether the possession of an inconsiderable territory without\r\nforts would not be attended with more loss than advantage, as it must\r\nnecessarily occasion considerable expense, must require troops for its\r\ndefence, and might probably in the end lead, as Sindia apprehended, to a\r\nrenewal of war.\"\r\n\r\nThat the said Warren Hastings, having in this manner put an end to a war\r\ncommenced by him without provocation, and continued by him without\r\nnecessity, and having for that purpose made so many sacrifices to the\r\nMahrattas in points of essential interest to the India Company, did\r\nconsent and agree to other articles utterly dishonorable to the British\r\nname and character, having sacrificed or abandoned every one of the\r\nnative princes who by _his_ solicitations and promises had been engaged\r\nto take part with us in the war,--and that he did so without necessity:\r\nsince it appears that Sindia, the Mahratta chief who concluded the\r\ntreaty, _in every part of his conduct manifested a hearty desire of\r\nestablishing a peace_ with us; and that this was the disposition of all\r\nthe parties in the Mahratta confederacy, who were only kept together by\r\na general dread of their common enemy, the English, and who only waited\r\nfor a cessation of hostilities with us to return to their habitual and\r\npermanent enmity against each other. That the Governor-General and\r\nCouncil, in their letter of 31st August, 1781, made the following\r\ndeclaration to the Court of Directors. \"The Mahrattas have demanded the\r\nsacrifice of the person of Ragonaut Row, the surrender of the fort and\r\nterritories of Ahmedabad, and of the fortress of Gualior, _which are not\r\nours to give, and which we could not wrest from the proprietors without\r\nthe greatest violation of public faith_. No state of affairs, in our\r\nopinions, could warrant our acquiescence to such requisition; and we are\r\nmorally certain, that, had we yielded to them, such a consciousness of\r\nthe state of our affairs would have been implied as would have produced\r\nan effect the very reverse from that for which it was intended, by\r\nraising the presumption of the enemy to exact yet more _ignominious_\r\nterms, or perhaps their refusal to accept of any; nor, in our opinion,\r\nwould they have failed to excite in others the same belief, and the\r\nconsequent decision of all parties against us, as the natural\r\nconsequences of our decline.\" That the said Hastings himself, in his\r\ninstructions to Mr. David Anderson, after authorizing him to restore\r\n_all_ that we had conquered during the war, expressly \"_excepted_\r\nAhmedabad, and the territory conquered for Futty Sing Gwicowar.\" That,\r\nnevertheless, the said Hastings, in the peace concluded by him, has\r\nyielded to every one of the conditions reprobated in the preceding\r\ndeclarations as _ignominious_ and incompatible with public faith.\r\n\r\nThat the said Warren Hastings did abandon the Ranna of Gohud in the\r\nmanner already charged; and that the said Ranna has not only lost the\r\nfort of Gualior, but all his own country, and is himself a prisoner.\r\nThat the said Hastings did not interpose to obtain any terms in favor of\r\nthe Nabob of Bopaul, who was _with great reason desirous of concealing\r\nfrom the Mahrattas the attachment he had borne to the English\r\ngovernment_:[21] the said Nabob having a just dread of the danger of\r\nbeing exposed to the resentment of the Mahrattas, and no dependence on\r\nthe faith and protection of the English. That by the ninth article of\r\nthe treaty with Futty Sing it was stipulated, that, when a negotiation\r\nfor peace should take place, his interest should be primarily\r\nconsidered; and that Mr. David Anderson, the minister and representative\r\nof the Governor-General and Council, did declare to Sindia, that it was\r\nindispensably incumbent on us to support Futty Sing's rights: that,\r\nnevertheless, every acquisition made for or by the said Futty Sing\r\nduring the war, particularly _the fort and territories of Ahmedabad_,\r\nwere given up by the said Hastings; that Futty Sing was replaced under\r\nthe subjection of the Peshwa, (whose resentment he had provoked by\r\ntaking part with us in the war,) and under an obligation to pay a\r\ntribute, not specified, to the Peshwa, and to perform such services and\r\nto be subject to such obedience _as had long been established and\r\ncustomary_; and that, no limit being fixed to such tribute or services,\r\nthe said Futty Sing has been left wholly at the mercy of the Mahrattas.\r\n\r\nThat, with respect to Ragoba, the said Hastings, in his instructions to\r\nMr. Anderson, dated 4th of November, 1781, contented himself with\r\nsaying, \"We cannot _totally_ abandon the interests of Ragonaut Row.\r\nEndeavor to obtain for him an adequate provision.\" That Mr. Anderson\r\ndeclared to Mahdajee Sindia,[22] \"that, as we had given Ragoba\r\nprotection as an independent prince, and not brought him into our\r\nsettlement as a prisoner, we could not _in honor_ pretend to impose the\r\n_smallest_ restraint on his will, and he must be at liberty to go\r\nwherever he pleased; that it must rest with Sindia himself to prevail on\r\nhim to reside in his country: all that we could do was to _agree_, after\r\na reasonable time, _to withdraw our protection from him, and not to\r\ninsist on the payment of the stipend to him_, as Sindia had proposed,\r\nunless on the condition of his residing in some part of Sindia's\r\nterritories.\"\r\n\r\nThat, notwithstanding all the preceding declarations, and in violation\r\nof the public faith repeatedly pledged to Ragoba, he was totally\r\nabandoned by the said Hastings in the treaty, no provision whatever\r\nbeing made even for his subsistence, but on a condition to which he\r\ncould not submit without the certain loss of his liberty and probable\r\nhazard of his life, namely, _that he should voluntarily and of his own\r\naccord repair to Sindia, and quietly reside with him_. That such\r\ntreacherous desertion of the said Ragoba is not capable of being\r\njustified by any plea of necessity: but that in fact no such necessity\r\nexisted; since it appears that the Nizam, who of all the contracting\r\nparties in the confederacy was personally most hostile to Ragoba, did\r\nhimself _propose that Ragoba, might have an option given him_ of\r\nresiding within the Company's territories.\r\n\r\nThat the plan of negotiating a peace with the Mahrattas by application\r\nto Sindia, and through his mediation, was earnestly recommended to the\r\nsaid Hastings by the Presidency of Bombay so early as in February, 1779,\r\nwho stated clearly to him the reasons why such application ought to be\r\nmade to Sindia in preference to any other of the Mahratta chiefs, and\r\nwhy it would probably be successful; the truth and justice of which\r\nreasons were fully evinced in the issue, when the said Hastings, after\r\nincurring, by two years' delay, all the losses and distresses of a\r\ncalamitous war, did actually pursue that very plan with much less effect\r\nor advantage than might have been obtained at the time the advice was\r\ngiven. That he neglected the advice of the Presidency of Bombay, and\r\nretarded the peace, as well as made its conditions worse, from an\r\nobstinate attachment to his project of an alliance offensive and\r\ndefensive with the Rajah of Berar, the object of which was rather a new\r\nwar than a termination of the war then existing against the Peshwa.\r\n\r\nThat the said Hastings did further embarrass and retard the conclusion\r\nof a peace by employing different ministers at the courts of the several\r\nconfederate powers, whom he severally empowered to treat and negotiate\r\na peace. That these ministers, not acting in concert, not knowing the\r\nextent of each other's commissions, and having no instructions to\r\ncommunicate their respective proceedings to each other, did in effect\r\ncounteract their several negotiations. That this want of concert and of\r\nsimplicity, and the mystery and intricacy in the mode of conducting the\r\nnegotiation on our part, was complained of by our ministers as\r\nembarrassing and disconcerting to us, while it was advantageous to the\r\nadverse party, who were thereby furnished with opportunity and pretence\r\nfor delay, when it suited their purpose, and enabled to play off one set\r\nof negotiators against another; that it also created jealousy and\r\ndistrust in the various contending parties, with whom we were treating\r\nat the same time, and to whom we were obliged to make contradictory\r\nprofessions, while it betrayed and exposed to them all our own eagerness\r\nand impatience for peace, raising thereby the general claims and\r\npretensions of the enemy. That, while Dalhousie Watherston, Esquire, was\r\ntreating at Poonah, and David Anderson, Esquire, in Sindia's camp, with\r\nseparate powers applied to the same object, the minister at Poonah\r\ninformed the said Watherston, that he had received proposals for peace\r\nfrom the Nabob of Arcot with the approbation of Sir Eyre Coote; that he\r\nhad returned other proposals to the said Nabob of Arcot, who had assured\r\nhim, the minister, that those proposals _would be acceded to, and that\r\nMr. Macpherson would set out for Bengal, after which orders should be\r\nimmediately dispatched from the Honorable the Governor-General and\r\nCouncil to the effect he wished_; that the said Nabob \"had promised to\r\nobtain and forward to him the expected _orders from Bengal in fifteen\r\ndays_, and that he was therefore every instant in expectation of their\r\narrival,--and observed, that, when General Goddard proposed to send a\r\nconfidential person to Poonah, he conceived that those orders must have\r\nactually reached him\": that therefore the treaty formally concluded by\r\nDavid Anderson was in effect and substance the same with that offered\r\nand in reality concluded by the Nabob of Arcot, with the exception only\r\nof Salsette, which the Nabob of Arcot had agreed to restore to the\r\nMahrattas.\r\n\r\nThat the intention of the said Warren Hastings, in pressing for a peace\r\nwith the Mahrattas on terms so dishonorable and by measures so rash and\r\nill-concerted, was not to restore and establish a general peace\r\nthroughout India, but to engage the India Company in a new war against\r\nHyder Ali, and to make the Mahrattas parties therein. That the eagerness\r\nand passion with which the said Hastings pursued this object laid him\r\nopen to the Mahrattas, who depended thereon for obtaining whatever they\r\nshould demand from us. That, in order to carry the point of an offensive\r\nalliance against Hyder Ali, the said Hastings exposed the negotiation\r\nfor peace with the Mahrattas to many difficulties and delays. That the\r\nMahrattas were bound by a clear and recent engagement, which Hyder had\r\nnever violated in any article, to make no peace with us which should not\r\ninclude him; that they pleaded the sacred nature of this obligation in\r\nanswer to all our requisitions on this head, while the said Hastings,\r\nstill importunate for his favorite point, suggested to them various\r\nmeans of reconciling a substantial breach of their engagement with a\r\nformal observance of it, and taught them how they might at once be\r\nparties in a peace with Hyder Ali and in an offensive alliance for\r\nimmediate hostility against him. That these lessons of public duplicity\r\nand artifice, and these devices of ostensible faith and real treachery,\r\ncould have no effect but to degrade the national character, and to\r\ninspire the Mahrattas themselves, with whom we were in treaty, with a\r\ndistrust in our sincerity and good faith. That the object of this\r\nfraudulent policy (viz., the utter destruction of Hyder Ali, and a\r\npartition of his dominions) was neither wise in itself, or authorized by\r\nthe orders and instructions of the Company to their servants; that it\r\nwas incompatible with the treaty of peace, in which Hyder Ali was\r\nincluded, and contrary to the repeated and best-understood injunctions\r\nof the Company,--being, in the first place, a bargain for a new war,\r\nand, in the next, aiming at an extension of our territory by conquest.\r\nThat the best and soundest political opinions on the relations of these\r\nstates have always represented our great security against the power of\r\nthe Mahrattas to depend on its being balanced by that of Hyder Ali; and\r\nthe Mysore country is so placed as a barrier between the Carnatic and\r\nthe Mahrattas as to make it our interest rather to strengthen and repair\r\nthat barrier than to level and destroy it. That the said treaty of\r\npartition does express itself to be _eventual_ with regard to the making\r\nand keeping of peace; but through the whole course of the said\r\nHastings's proceeding he did endeavor to prevent any peace with the\r\nSultan or Nabob of Mysore, Tippoo Sahib, and did for a long time\r\nendeavor to frustrate all the methods which could have rendered the\r\nsaid treaty of conquest and partition wholly unnecessary.\r\n\r\nThat the Mahrattas having taken no effectual step to oblige Hyder Ali to\r\nmake good the conditions for which they had engaged in his behalf, and\r\nthe war continuing to be carried on in the Carnatic by Tippoo Sultan,\r\nson and successor of Hyder Ali, the Presidency of Fort St. George\r\nundertook, upon their own authority, to open a negotiation with the said\r\nTippoo: which measure, though indispensably necessary, the said Hastings\r\nutterly disapproved and discountenanced, expressly denying that there\r\nwas any ground or motive for entering into any direct or separate treaty\r\nwith Tippoo, and not consenting to or authorizing any negotiation for\r\nsuch treaty, until after a cessation of hostilities had been brought\r\nabout with him by the Presidency of Fort St. George, in August, 1783,\r\nand the ministers of Tippoo had been received and treated with by that\r\nPresidency, and commissioners, in return, actually sent by the said\r\nPresidency to the court of Poonah: which late and reluctant consent and\r\nauthority were extorted from him, the said Hastings, in consequence of\r\nthe acknowledgment of his agent at the court of Mahdajee Sindia, upon\r\nwhom the said Warren Hastings had depended for enforcing the clauses of\r\nthe Mahratta treaty, of the precariousness of such dependence, and of\r\nthe necessity of that direct and separate treaty with Tippoo, so long\r\nand so lately reprobated by the said Warren Hastings, notwithstanding\r\nthe information and entreaties of the Presidency of Fort St. George, as\r\nwell as the known distresses and critical situation of the Company's\r\naffairs. That, though the said Warren Hastings did at length give\r\ninstructions for negotiating and making peace with Tippoo, expressly\r\nadding, that those instructions extended to _all_ the points which\r\noccurred to _him or them_ as capable of being agitated or gained upon\r\nthe occasion,--though the said instructions were sent after the said\r\ncommissioners by the Presidency of Fort St. George, with directions to\r\nobey them,--though not only the said instructions were obeyed, but\r\nadvantages gained which did not occur to the said Warren\r\nHastings,--though the said peace formed a contrast with the Mahratta\r\npeace, in neither ceding any territory possessed by the Company before\r\nthe war, or delivering up any dependant or ally to the vengeance of his\r\nadversaries, but providing for the restoration of all the countries that\r\nhad been taken from the Company and their allies,--though the Supreme\r\nCouncil of Calcutta, forming the legal government of Bengal in the\r\nabsence of the said Warren Hastings, ratified the said treaty,--yet the\r\nsaid Warren Hastings, then absent from the seat of government, and out\r\nof the province of Bengal, and forming no legal or integral part of the\r\ngovernment during such absence, did, after such ratification, usurp the\r\npower of acting as a part of such government (as if actually sitting in\r\nCouncil with the other members of the same) in the consideration and\r\nunqualified censure of the terms of the said peace.\r\n\r\nThat the Nabob of Arcot, with whom the said Hastings did keep up an\r\nunwarrantable clandestine correspondence, without any communication with\r\nthe Presidency of Madras, wrote a letter of complaint, dated the 27th of\r\nMarch, 1784, against the Presidency of that place, without any\r\ncommunication thereof to the said Presidency, the said complaint being\r\naddressed to the said Warren Hastings, the substance of which complaint\r\nwas, that he, the Nabob, had not been made a party to the late treaty;\r\nand although his interest had been sufficiently provided for in the said\r\ntreaty, the said Warren Hastings did sign a declaration, on the 23d of\r\nMay, at Lucknow, forming the basis of a new article, and making a new\r\nparty to the treaty, after it had been by all parties (the Supreme\r\nCouncil of Calcutta included) completed and ratified, and did transmit\r\nthe said new stipulation to the Presidency at Calcutta, solely for the\r\npurposes and at the instigation of the Nabob of Arcot; and the said\r\ndeclaration was made without any previous communication with the\r\nPresidency aforesaid, and in consequence thereof orders were sent by the\r\nCouncil at Calcutta to the Presidency of Fort St. George, _under the\r\nseverest threats in case of disobedience_: which orders, whatever were\r\ntheir purport, would, as an undue assumption of and participation in the\r\ngovernment, from which he was absent, become a high misdemeanor; but,\r\nbeing to the purport of opening the said treaty after its solemn\r\nratification, and proposing a new clause and a new party to the same,\r\nwas also an aggravation of such misdemeanor, as it tended to convey to\r\nthe Indian powers an idea of the unsteadiness of the councils and\r\ndeterminations of the British government, and to take away all reliance\r\non its engagements, and as, above all, it exposed the affairs of the\r\nnation and the Company to the hazard of seeing renewed all the\r\ncalamities of war, from whence by the conclusion of the treaty they had\r\nemerged, and upon a pretence so weak as that of proposing the Nabob of\r\nArcot to be a party to the same,--though he had not been made a party by\r\nthe said Warren Hastings in the Mahratta treaty, which professed to be\r\nfor the relief of the Carnatic,--though he was not a party to the former\r\ntreaty with Hyder, also relative to the Carnatic,--though it was not\r\ncertain, if the treaty were once opened, and that even Tippoo should\r\nthen consent to that Nabob's being a party, whether he, the said Nabob,\r\nwould agree to the clauses of the same, and consequently whether the\r\nsaid treaty, once opened, could afterwards be concluded: an uncertainty\r\nof which he, the said Hastings, should have learned to be aware, having\r\nalready once been disappointed by the said Nabob's refusing to accede to\r\na treaty which he, the said Warren Hastings, made for him with the\r\nDutch, about a year before.\r\n\r\nThat the said Warren Hastings,--having broken a solemn and honorable\r\ntreaty of peace by an unjust and unprovoked war,--having neglected to\r\nconclude that war when he might have done it without loss of honor to\r\nthe nation,--having plotted and contrived, as far as depended on him, to\r\nengage the India Company in another war as soon as the former should be\r\nconcluded,--and having at last put an end to a most unjust war against\r\nthe Mahrattas by a most ignominious peace with them, in which he\r\nsacrificed objects essential to the interests, and submitted to\r\nconditions utterly incompatible with the honor of this nation, and with\r\nhis own declared sense of the dishonorable nature of those\r\nconditions,--and having endeavored to open anew the treaty concluded\r\nwith Tippoo Sultan through the means of the Presidency of Fort St.\r\nGeorge, upon principles of justice and honor, and which established\r\npeace in India, and thereby exposing the British possessions there to\r\nthe renewal of the dangers and calamities of war,--has by these several\r\nacts been guilty of sundry high crimes and misdemeanors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI.--CORRESPONDENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat, by an act of the 13th year of his present Majesty, intituled, \"An\r\nact for establishing certain regulations for the better management of\r\nthe affairs of the East India Company, as well in India as in Europe,\r\nthe Governor-General and Council are required and directed to pay due\r\nobedience to all such orders as they shall receive from the Court of\r\nDirectors of the said United Company, and to correspond from time to\r\ntime, and constantly and diligently transmit to the said Court an exact\r\nparticular of all advices or intelligence and of all transactions and\r\nmatters whatsoever that shall come to their knowledge, relating to the\r\ngovernment, commerce, revenues, or interest of the said United Company.\"\r\n\r\nThat, in consequence of the above-recited act, the Court of Directors,\r\nin their general instructions of the 29th March, 1774, to the\r\nGovernor-General and Council, did direct, \"that the correspondence with\r\nthe princes or country powers in India should be carried on through the\r\nGovernor-General only; but that all letters to be sent by him should be\r\nfirst approved in Council; and that he should lay before the Council, at\r\ntheir next meeting, all letters received by him in the course of such\r\ncorrespondence, for their information.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the Governor-General and Council were therein further ordered,\r\n\"that, in transacting the business of their department, they should\r\nenter with the utmost perspicuity and exactness all their proceedings\r\nwhatsoever, and all dissents, if such should at any time be made by any\r\nmember of their board, together with all letters sent or received in the\r\ncourse of their correspondence; and that broken sets of such\r\nproceedings, to the latest period possible, be transmitted to them [the\r\nCourt of Directors], a complete set at the end of every year, and a\r\nduplicate by the next conveyance.\"\r\n\r\nThat, in defiance of the said orders, and in breach of the above-recited\r\nact of Parliament, the said Warren Hastings has, in sundry instances,\r\nconcealed from his Council the correspondence carried on between him and\r\nthe princes or country powers in India, and neglected to communicate the\r\nadvices and intelligence he from time to time received from the British\r\nResidents at the different courts in India to the other members of the\r\ngovernment, and, without their knowledge, counsel, or participation, has\r\ndispatched orders on matters of the utmost consequence to the interests\r\nof the Company.\r\n\r\nThat, moreover, the said Warren Hastings, for the purpose of covering\r\nhis own improper and dangerous practices from his employers, has\r\nwithheld from the Court of Directors, upon sundry occasions, copies of\r\nthe proceedings had, and the correspondence carried on by him in his\r\nofficial capacity as Governor-General, whereby the Court of Directors\r\nhave been kept in ignorance of matters which it highly imported them to\r\nknow, and the affairs of the Company have been exposed to much\r\ninconvenience and injury.\r\n\r\nThat, in all such concealments and acts done or ordered without the\r\nconsent and authority of the Supreme Council, the said Warren Hastings\r\nhas been guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII.--FYZOOLA KHÂN.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I.\r\n\r\nRIGHTS OF FYZOOLA KHÂN, ETC., BEFORE THE TREATY OF LALL-DANG.\r\n\r\nI. That the Nabob Fyzoola Khân, who now holds of the Vizier the\r\nterritory of Rampoor, Shahabad, and certain other districts dependent\r\nthereon, in the country of the Rohillas, is the second son of a prince\r\nrenowned in the history of Hindostan under the name of Ali Mohammed\r\nKhân, some time sovereign of all that part of Rohilcund which is\r\nparticularly distinguished by the appellation of the Kutteehr.\r\n\r\nII. That, after the death of Ali Mohammed aforesaid, as Fyzoola Khân,\r\ntogether with his elder brother, was then a prisoner of war at a place\r\ncalled Herat, \"the Rohilla chiefs took possession of the ancient\r\nestates\" of the captive princes; and the Nabob Fyzoola Khân was from\r\nnecessity compelled to waive his hereditary rights for the\r\ninconsiderable districts of Rampoor and Shahabad, then estimated to\r\nproduce from six to eight lacs of annual revenue.\r\n\r\nIII. That in 1774, on the invasion of Rohilcund by the united armies of\r\nthe Vizier Sujah ul Dowlah and the Company, the Nabob Fyzoola Khân,\r\n\"with some of his people, was present at the decisive battle of St.\r\nGeorge,\" where Hafiz Rhamet, the great leader of the Rohillas, and many\r\nothers of their principal chiefs were slain; but, escaping from the\r\nslaughter, Fyzoola Khân \"made his retreat good towards the mountains,\r\nwith all his treasure.\" He there collected the scattered remains of his\r\ncountrymen; and as he was the eldest surviving son of Ali Mohammed Khân,\r\nas, too, the most powerful obstacle to his pretensions was now removed\r\nby the death of Hafiz, he seems at length to have been generally\r\nacknowledged by his natural subjects the undoubted heir of his father's\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nIV. That, \"regarding the sacred _sincerity_ and friendship of the\r\nEnglish, whose _goodness_ and celebrity is everywhere known, _who\r\ndispossess no one_,\" the Nabob Fyzoola Khân made early overtures for\r\npeace to Colonel Alexander Champion, commander-in-chief of the Company's\r\nforces in Bengal: that he did propose to the said Colonel Alexander\r\nChampion, in three letters, received on the 14th, 24th, and 27th of May,\r\nto put himself under the protection either of the Company, or of the\r\nVizier, through the mediation and with the guaranty of the Company; and\r\nthat he did offer, \"whatever was conferred upon him, to pay as much\r\nwithout damage or deficiency as any other person would agree to do\":\r\nstating, at the same time, his condition and pretensions hereinbefore\r\nrecited as facts \"evident as the sun\"; and appealing, in a forcible and\r\nawful manner, to the generosity and magnanimity of this nation, \"by\r\nwhose means he hoped in God that he should receive justice\"; and as \"the\r\nperson who designed the war was no more,\" as \"in that he was himself\r\nguiltless,\" and as \"he had never acted in such a manner as for the\r\nVizier to have taken hatred to his heart against him, that he might be\r\nreinstated in his ancient possessions, the country of Ins father.\"\r\n\r\nV. That on the last of the three dates above mentioned, that is to say,\r\non the 27th of May, the Nabob Fyzoola Khân did also send to the\r\ncommander-in-chief a _vakeel_, or ambassador, who was authorized on the\r\npart of him, the Nabob Fyzoola Khân, his master, to make a specific\r\noffer of three propositions; and that by one of the said propositions\r\n\"an annual increase of near 400,000_l._ would have accrued to the\r\nrevenues of our ally, and the immediate acquisition of above 300,000_l._\r\nto the Company, for their influence in effecting an accommodation\r\nperfectly consistent with their engagements to the Vizier,\" and strictly\r\nconsonant to the demands of justice.\r\n\r\nVI. That, so great was the confidence of the Nabob Fyzoola Khân in the\r\njust, humane, and liberal feelings of Englishmen, as to \"lull him into\r\nan inactivity\" of the most essential detriment to his interests: since,\r\n\"in the hopes which he entertained from the interposition of our\r\ngovernment,\" he declined the invitation of the Mogul to join the arms of\r\nhis Majesty and the Mahrattas, \"refused any connection with the Seiks,\"\r\nand did even neglect to take the obvious precaution of crossing the\r\nGanges, as he had originally intended, while the river was yet\r\nfordable,--a movement that would have enabled him certainly to baffle\r\nall pursuit, and probably \"to keep the Vizier in a state of disquietude\r\nfor the remainder of his life.\"\r\n\r\nVII. That the commander-in-chief, Colonel Alexander Champion aforesaid,\r\n\"thought nothing could be more honorable to this nation than the support\r\nof so exalted a character; and whilst it could be done on terms so\r\nadvantageous, supposed it very unlikely that the vakeel's proposition\r\nshould be received with indifference\"; that he did accordingly refer it\r\nto the administration through Warren Hastings, Esquire, then Governor of\r\nFort William and President of Bengal; and he did at the same time\r\ninclose to the said Warren Hastings a letter from the Nabob Fyzoola Khân\r\nto the said Hastings,--which letter does not appear, but must be\r\nsupposed to have been of the same tenor with those before cited to the\r\ncommander-in-chief,--of which also copies were sent to the said Hastings\r\nby the commander-in-chief; and he, the commander-in-chief aforesaid,\r\nafter urging to the said Hastings sundry good and cogent arguments of\r\npolicy and prudence in favor of the Nabob Fyzoola Khân, did conclude by\r\n\"wishing for nothing so much as for the adoption of some measure that\r\nmight strike all the powers of the East with admiration of our justice,\r\nin contrast to the conduct of the Vizier.\"\r\n\r\nVIII. That, in answer to such laudable wish of the said\r\ncommander-in-chief, the President, Warren Hastings, preferring his own\r\nprohibited plans of extended dominion to the mild, equitable, and wise\r\npolicy inculcated in the standing orders of his superiors, and now\r\nenforced by the recommendation of the commander-in-chief, did instruct\r\nand \"desire\" him, the said commander-in-chief, \"instead of soliciting\r\nthe Vizier to relinquish his conquest to Fyzoola Khân, to discourage it\r\nas much as was in his power\"; although the said Hastings did not once\r\nexpress, or even intimate, any doubt whatever of the Nabob Fyzoola\r\nKhân's innocence as to the origin of the war, or of his hereditary\r\nright to the territories which he claimed, but to the said pleas of the\r\nNabob Fyzoola Khân, as well as to the arguments both of policy and\r\njustice advanced by the commander-in-chief, he, the said Hastings, did\r\nsolely oppose certain speculative objects of imagined expediency,\r\nsumming up his decided rejection of the proposals made by the Nabob\r\nFyzoola Khân in the following remarkable words. \"With respect to Fyzoola\r\nKhân, _he appears not to merit our consideration. The petty sovereign of\r\na country estimated at six or eight lacs ought not for a moment to prove\r\nan impediment to any of our measures, or to affect the consistency of\r\nour conduct_.\"\r\n\r\nIX. That, in the aforesaid violent and arbitrary position, the said\r\nWarren Hastings did avow it to be a public principle of his government,\r\nthat no right, however manifest, and no innocence, however unimpeached,\r\ncould entitle the weak to our protection against others, or save them\r\nfrom our own active endeavors for their oppression, and even\r\nextirpation, should they interfere with our notions of political\r\nexpediency; and that such a principle is highly derogatory to the\r\njustice and honor of the English name, and fundamentally injurious to\r\nour interests, inasmuch as it hath an immediate tendency to excite\r\ndistrust, jealousy, fear, and hatred against us among all the\r\nsubordinate potentates of Hindostan.\r\n\r\nX. That, in prosecution of the said despotic principle, the President,\r\nWarren Hastings aforesaid, did persist to obstruct, as far as in him\r\nlay, every advance towards an accommodation between the Vizier Sujah ul\r\nDowlah and the Nabob Fyzoola Khân; and particularly on the 16th of\r\nSeptember, only eight days after the said Hastings, in, conjunction with\r\nthe other members of the Select Committee of Bengal, had publicly\r\ntestified his _satisfaction_ in the prospect of _an accommodation_, and\r\nhad _hoped_ that \"his Excellency [the Vizier] would be disposed to\r\nconciliate the affections [of the Rohillas] to his government _by\r\nacceding to lenient terms_,\" he, the said Hastings, did nevertheless\r\nwrite, and without the consent or knowledge of his colleagues did\r\nprivately dispatch, a certain answer to a letter of the\r\ncommander-in-chief, in which answer the said Hastings did express other\r\n_contradictory hopes_, namely, that the commander-in-chief _had resolved\r\non prosecuting the war to a final issue_,--\"because\" (as the said\r\nHastings explains himself) \"it appears very plainly that Fyzoola Khân\r\nand his adherents _lay at your mercy_, because I apprehend much\r\ninconveniency from delays, and because _I am morally certain that no\r\ngood will he gained by negotiating_\": thereby artfully suggesting his\r\nwishes of what might be, in his hopes of what had been, resolved; and\r\nplainly, though indirectly, instigating the commander-in-chief to much\r\neffusion of blood in an immediate attack on the Rohillas, posted as they\r\nwere \"in a very strong situation,\" and \"combating for all.\"\r\n\r\nXI. That the said Hastings, in the answer aforesaid, did further\r\nendeavor to inflame the commander-in-chief against the Nabob Fyzoola\r\nKhân, by representing the said Nabob \"as highly presuming, insolent, and\r\nevasive\"; and knowing the distrust which the Nabob Fyzoola Khân\r\nentertained of the Vizier, the said Hastings did \"expressly desire it\r\nshould be left wholly to the Vizier to treat with the enemy by _his own\r\nagents_ and _in his own manner_,\"--though he, the said Hastings, \"by no\r\nmeans wished the Vizier to lose time by seeking an accommodation, since\r\nit would be more effectual, more decisive, and more _consistent with his\r\ndignity, indeed with his honor, which he has already pledged_, to abide\r\nby his first offers, to dictate the conditions of peace, and to admit\r\nonly an acceptance without reservation, or a clear refusal, from his\r\nadversary\": thereby affecting to hold up, in opposition to and in\r\nexclusion of the substantial claims of justice, certain ideal\r\nobligations of dignity and honor,--that is to say, the gratification of\r\npride, and the observance of an arrogant determination once declared.\r\n\r\nXII. That, although the said answer did not reach the commander-in-chief\r\nuntil peace was actually concluded, and although the dangerous\r\nconsequences to be apprehended from the said answer were thereby\r\nprevented, yet, by the sentiments contained in the said answer, Warren\r\nHastings, Esquire, did strongly evince his ultimate adherence to all the\r\nformer violent and unjust principles of his conduct towards the Nabob\r\nFyzoola Khân, which principles were disgraceful to the character and\r\ninjurious to the interests of this nation; and that the said Warren\r\nHastings did thereby, in a particular manner, exclude himself from any\r\nshare of credit for \"the honorable period put to the Rohilla war, which\r\nhas in some degree done away the reproach so wantonly brought on the\r\nEnglish name.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\nRIGHTS OF FYZOOLA KHÂN UNDER THE TREATY OF LALL-DANG.\r\n\r\nI. That, notwithstanding the culpable and criminal reluctance of the\r\nPresident, Hastings, hereinbefore recited, a treaty of peace and\r\nfriendship between the Vizier Sujah ul Dowlah and the Nabob Fyzoola Khân\r\nwas finally signed and sealed on the 7th October, 1774, at a place\r\ncalled Lall-Dang, in the presence and with the attestation of the\r\nBritish commander-in-chief, Colonel Alexander Champion aforesaid; and\r\nthat for the said treaty the Nabob Fyzoola Khân agreed to pay, and did\r\nactually pay, the valuable consideration of half his treasure, to the\r\namount of fifteen lacs of rupees, or 150,000_l._ sterling, and upwards.\r\n\r\nII. That by the said treaty the Nabob Fyzoola Khân was established in\r\nthe quiet possession of Rampoor, Shahabad, and \"some other districts\r\ndependent thereon,\" subject to certain conditions, of which the more\r\nimportant were as follow.\r\n\r\n\"That Fyzoola Khân should retain in his service five thousand _troops_,\r\nand not a single man more.\r\n\r\n\"That, with whomsoever the Vizier should make war, Fyzoola Khân should\r\nsend _two or three thousand men, according to his ability_, to join the\r\nforces of the Vizier.\r\n\r\n\"And that, if the Vizier should march in person, Fyzoola Khân should\r\nhimself accompany him _with his troops_.\"\r\n\r\nIII. That from the terms of the treaty above recited it doth plainly,\r\npositively, and indisputably appear that the Nabob Fyzoola Khân, in\r\ncase of war, was not bound to furnish more than three thousand men under\r\nany construction, unless the Vizier should march in person.\r\n\r\nIV. That the Nabob Fyzoola Khân was not positively bound to furnish so\r\nmany as three thousand men, but an indefinite number, not more than\r\nthree and not less than two thousand; that of the precise number within\r\nsuch limitations the ability of Fyzoola Khân, and not the discretion of\r\nthe Vizier, was to be the standard; and that such ability could only\r\nmean that which was equitably consistent not only with the external\r\ndefence of his jaghire, but with the internal good management thereof,\r\nboth as to its police and revenue.\r\n\r\nV. That, even in case the Vizier should march in person, it might be\r\nreasonably doubted whether the personal service of the Nabob Fyzoola\r\nKhân \"with his troops\" must be understood to be with _all_ his troops,\r\nor only with the number before stipulated, not more than three and not\r\nless than two thousand men; and that the latter is the interpretation\r\nfinally adopted by Warren Hastings aforesaid, and the Council of Bengal,\r\nwho, in a letter to the Court of Directors, dated April 5th, 1783,\r\nrepresent the clauses of the treaty relative to the stipulated aid as\r\nmeaning simply that Fyzoola Khân \"should send two or three thousand men\r\nto join the Vizier's forces, or attend in person in case it should be\r\nrequisite.\"\r\n\r\nVI. That from the aforesaid terms of the treaty it doth not specifically\r\nappear of what the stipulated aid should consist, whether of horse or\r\nfoot, or in what proportion of both; but that it is the recorded\r\nopinion, maturely formed by the said Hastings and his Council, in\r\nJanuary, 1783, that even \"a single horseman included in the aid which\r\nFyzoola Khân might furnish would prove a literal compliance with the\r\nstipulation.\"\r\n\r\nVII. That, in the event of any doubt fairly arising from the terms of\r\nthe treaty, the Nabob Fyzoola Khân, in consideration of his hereditary\r\nright to the whole country, and the price by him actually paid for the\r\nsaid treaty, was in equity entitled to the most favorable construction.\r\n\r\nVIII. That, from the attestation of Colonel Champion aforesaid, the\r\ngovernment of Calcutta acquired the same right to interpose with the\r\nVizier for the protection of the Nabob Fyzoola Khân as they, the said\r\ngovernment, had before claimed from a similar attestation of Sir Robert\r\nBarker to assist the Vizier in extirpating the whole nation of the said\r\nFyzoola Khân,--more especially as in the case of Sir Robert Barker it\r\nwas contrary to the remonstrances of the then administration, and the\r\nfurthest from the intentions of the said Barker himself, that his\r\nattestation should involve the Company, but the attestation of Colonel\r\nChampion was authorized by all the powers of the government, as a\r\n\"sanction\" intended \"to add validity\" to the treaty; that they, the said\r\ngovernment, and in particular the said Warren Hastings, as the first\r\nexecutive member of the same, were bound by the ties of natural justice\r\nduly to exercise the aforesaid right, if need were; and that their duty\r\nso to interfere was more particularly enforced by the spirit of the\r\ncensures passed both by the Directors and Proprietors in the Rohilla\r\nwar, and the satisfaction expressed by the Directors \"in the honorable\r\nend put to that war.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III.\r\n\r\nGUARANTY OF THE TREATY OF LALL-DANG.\r\n\r\nI. That during the life of the Vizier Sujah ul Dowlah, and for some time\r\nafter his death, under his son and successor, Asoph ul Dowlah, the Nabob\r\nFyzoola Khân did remain without disturbance or molestation; that he did\r\nall the while imagine his treaty to be under the sanction of the\r\nCompany, from Colonel Champion's affixing his signature thereto as a\r\nwitness, \"which signature, as he [Fyzoola Khân] supposed,\" (rendered the\r\nCompany the _arbitrators_) between the Vizier and himself, in case of\r\ndisputes; and that, being \"a man of sense, but _extreme pusillanimity_,\r\na good farmer, fond of wealth, _not possessed of the passion of\r\nambition_,\" he did peaceably apply himself to \"improve the state of his\r\ncountry, and did, _by his own prudence and attention_, increase the\r\nrevenues thereof beyond the amount specified in Sujah ul Dowlah's\r\ngrant.\"\r\n\r\nII. That in the year 1777, and in the beginning of the year 1778, being\r\n\"alarmed at the young Vizier's resumption of a number of jaghires\r\ngranted by his father to different persons, and the injustice and\r\noppression of his conduct in general,\" and having now learned (from whom\r\ndoes not appear, but probably from some person supposed of competent\r\nauthority) that Colonel Champion formerly witnessed the treaty as a\r\nprivate person, the Nabob Fyzoola Khân did make frequent and urgent\r\nsolicitations to Nathaniel Middleton, Esquire, then Resident at Oude,\r\nand to Warren Hastings aforesaid, then Governor-General of Bengal, \"for\r\na renovation of his [the Nabob Fyzoola Khân's] treaty with the late\r\nVizier, and the guaranty of the Company,\" or for a \"separate agreement\r\nwith the Company for his defence\": considering them, the Company, as\r\n\"the only power in which he had confidence, and to which he could look\r\nup for protection.\"\r\n\r\nIII. That the said Resident Middleton, and the said Governor-General\r\nHastings, did not, as they were in duty bound to do, endeavor to allay\r\nthe apprehensions of the Nabob Fyzoola Khân by assuring him of his\r\nsafety under the sanction of Colonel Champion's attestation aforesaid,\r\nbut by their criminal neglect, if not by positive expressions, (as there\r\nis just ground from their subsequent language and conduct to believe,)\r\nthey, the said Middleton and the said Hastings, did at least keep alive\r\nand confirm (whoever may have originally suggested) the said\r\napprehension; and that such neglect alone was the more highly culpable\r\nin the said Hastings, inasmuch as he, the said Hastings, in conjunction\r\nwith other members of the Select Committee of the then Presidency of\r\nBengal, did, on the 17th of September, 1774, write to Colonel Champion\r\naforesaid, publicly authorizing him, the said Colonel Champion, to join\r\nhis _sanction_ to the accommodations agreed on between the Vizier Sujah\r\nul Dowlah and the Nabob Fyzoola Khân, _to add to their validity_,--and\r\non the 6th of October following did again write to the said Colonel\r\nChampion, more explicitly, to join his sanction, \"either by attesting\r\nthe treaty, or _acting as guaranty_ on the part of the Company for the\r\nperformance of it\": both which letters, though they did not arrive until\r\nafter the actual signature of the said Colonel Champion, do yet\r\nincontrovertibly mark the solemn intention of the said Committee (of\r\nwhich the said Hastings was President) that the sanction of Colonel\r\nChampion's attestation should be regarded as a public, not a private,\r\nsanction; and it was more peculiarly incumbent on such persons, who had\r\nbeen members of the said Committee, so to regard the same.\r\n\r\nIV. That the said Warren Hastings was further guilty of much criminal\r\nconcealment for the space of \"twelve months,\" inasmuch as he did not lay\r\nbefore the board the frequent and urgent solicitations which he, the\r\nsaid Hastings, was continually receiving from the Nabob Fyzoola Khân,\r\nuntil the 9th of March, 1778; on which day the said Hastings did\r\ncommunicate to the Council a public letter of the aforesaid Middleton,\r\nResident at Oude, acquainting the board that he, the said Middleton,\r\ntaking occasion from a late application of Fyzoola Khân for the\r\nCompany's guaranty, had deputed Mr. Daniel Octavus Barwell (Assistant\r\nResident at Benares, but then on a visit to the Resident Middleton at\r\nLucknow) to proceed with a special commission to Rampoor, there to\r\ninquire on the spot into the truth of certain reports circulated to the\r\nprejudice of Fyzoola Khân, which reports, however, the said Middleton\r\ndid afterwards confess himself to have \"_always_\" _thought_ \"_in the\r\nhighest degree improbable_.\"\r\n\r\nThat the said Resident Middleton did \"request to know whether, on proof\r\nof Fyzoola Khân's innocence, the honorable board would be pleased to\r\ngrant him [the Resident] permission to comply with his [Fyzoola Khân's]\r\nrequest of the Company's guarantying his treaty with the Vizier.\" And\r\nthe said Middleton, in excuse for having irregularly \"availed himself of\r\nthe abilities of Mr. Daniel Barwell,\" who belonged to another station,\r\nand for deputing him with the aforesaid commission to Rampoor without\r\nthe previous knowledge of the board, did urge the plea \"_of immediate\r\nnecessity_\"; and that such plea, if the necessity really existed, was a\r\nstrong charge and accusation against the said Warren Hastings, from\r\nwhose criminal neglect and concealment the urgency of such necessity did\r\narise.\r\n\r\nV. That the Governor-General, Warren Hastings aforesaid, did immediately\r\nmove, \"that the board approve the deputation of Mr. Daniel Barwell, and\r\nthat the Resident [Middleton] be authorized to offer the Company's\r\nguaranty for the observance of the treaty subsisting between the Vizier\r\nand Fyzoola Khân, provided it meets with the Vizier's concurrence\"; and\r\nthat the Governor-General's proposition was resolved in the affirmative:\r\nthe usual majority of Council then consisting of Richard Barwell,\r\nEsquire, a near relation of Daniel Octavus Barwell aforesaid, and the\r\nGovernor-General, Warren Hastings, who, in case of an equality, had the\r\ncasting voice.\r\n\r\nVI. That, on receiving from Mr. Daniel Barwell full and early assurance\r\nof Fyzoola Khân's \"having preserved every article of his treaty\r\ninviolate,\" the Resident, Middleton, applied for the Vizier's\r\nconcurrence, which was readily obtained,--the Vizier, however,\r\n\"_premising_, that he gave his consent, taking it for granted, that, on\r\nFyzoola Khân's receiving the treaty and _khelaut_ [or robe of honor], he\r\nwas to make him a return of the complimentary presents usually offered\r\non such occasions, and _of such an amount as should be a manifestation\r\nof Fyzoola Khân's due sense of his friendship, and suitable to his\r\nExcellency's rank to receive_\"; and that the Resident, Middleton, \"did\r\nmake himself in some measure responsible for the said presents being\r\nobtained,\" and did write to Mr. Daniel Barwell accordingly.\r\n\r\nVII. That, agreeably to the resolution of Council hereinbefore recited,\r\nthe solicited guaranty, under the seal of the Resident, Middleton, thus\r\nduly authorized on behalf of the Company, was transmitted, together with\r\nthe renewed treaty, to Mr. Daniel Barwell aforesaid at Rampoor, and that\r\nthey were both by him, the said Barwell, presented to the Nabob Fyzoola\r\nKhân, with a solemnity not often paralleled, \"in the presence of the\r\ngreatest part of the Nabob's subjects, who were assembled, that the\r\nceremony might create a full belief in the breasts of all his people\r\nthat the Company would protect him as long as he strictly adhered to the\r\n_letter_ of his treaty.\"\r\n\r\nVIII. That, in the conclusion of the said ceremony, the Nabob Fyzoola\r\nKhân did deliver to the said Barwell, for the use of the Vizier, a\r\n_nuzzer_ (or present) of elephants, horses, &c., and did add thereto a\r\nlac of rupees, or 10,000_l._ and upwards: which sum the said Barwell,\r\n\"not being authorized to accept any pecuniary consideration, did at\r\nfirst refuse; but upon Fyzoola Khân's urging, that on such occasions it\r\nwas the invariable custom of Hindostan, and _that it must on the present\r\nbe expected, as it had been formerly the case_,\" (but when does not\r\nappear,) he, the said Barwell, did accept the said lac in the name of\r\nthe Vizier, our ally, \"in whose wealth\" (as Warren Hastings on another\r\noccasion observed) \"we should participate,\" and on whom we at that time\r\nhad an accumulating demand.\r\n\r\nIX. That, over and above the lac of rupees thus presented to the Vizier,\r\nthe Nabob Fyzoola Khân did likewise offer one other lac of rupees, or\r\nupwards of 10,000_l._ more, for the Company, \"as some acknowledgment of\r\nthe obligation he received; that, although such acknowledgment was not\r\npretended to be the invariable custom of Hindostan on such occasions,\r\nhowever it might on the present be expected,\" Mr. Daniel Barwell\r\naforesaid (knowing, probably, the disposition and views of the then\r\nactual government at Calcutta) did not, _even at first_, decline the\r\nsaid offer, but, as he was not empowered to accept it, did immediately\r\npropose taking a bond for the amount, until the pleasure of the board\r\nshould be known.\r\n\r\nThat the offer was accordingly communicated by the said Barwell to the\r\nResident, Middleton, to be by him, the Resident, referred to the board,\r\nand that it was so referred; that, in reply to the said reference of the\r\nResident, Middleton, the Governor-General, Warren Hastings, did move and\r\ncarry a vote of Council, \"authorizing Mr. Middleton to accept the offer\r\nmade by Fyzoola Khân to the Company of one lac of rupees,\" without\r\nassigning any reason whatever in support of the said motion,\r\nnotwithstanding it was objected by a member of the board, \"that, if the\r\nmeasure was right, it became us to adopt it without such a\r\nconsideration,\" and that \"our accepting of the lac of rupees as a\r\nrecompense for our interposition is beneath the dignity of this\r\ngovernment [of Calcutta], and will discredit us in the eyes of the\r\nIndian powers.\"\r\n\r\nThat the acceptance of the said sum, in this circumstance, was beneath\r\nthe dignity of the said government, and did tend so to discredit us; and\r\nthat the motion of the said Hastings for such acceptance was therefore\r\nhighly derogatory to the honor of this nation.\r\n\r\nX. That the aforesaid member of the Council did further disapprove\r\naltogether of the guaranty, \"as unnecessary\"; and that another member of\r\nCouncil, Richard Barwell, Esquire, the near relation of Daniel Octavus\r\nBarwell, hereinbefore named, did declare, (but after the said guaranty\r\nhad taken place,) that \"this government [of Calcutta] was in fact\r\nengaged by Colonel Champion's signature being to the treaty with Fyzoola\r\nKhân.\" That the said unnecessary guaranty did not only subject to an\r\nheavy expense a prince whom we were bound to protect, but did further\r\nproduce in his mind the following obvious and natural conclusion,\r\nnamely, \"_that the signature of any person, in whatever public capacity\r\nhe at present appears, will not be valid and of effect, as soon as some\r\nother shall fill his station_\": a conclusion, however, immediately\r\ntending to the total discredit of all powers delegated from the board to\r\nany individual servant of the Company, and consequently to clog,\r\nperplex, and embarrass in future all transactions carried on at a\r\ndistance from the seat of government, and to disturb the security of\r\nall persons possessing instruments already so ratified,--yet the only\r\nconclusion left to Fyzoola Khân which did not involve some affront\r\neither to the private honor of the Company's servants or to the public\r\nhonor of the Company itself; and that the suspicions which originated\r\nfrom the said idea in the breast of Fyzoola Khân to the prejudice of the\r\nResident Middleton's authority did compel the Governor-General, Warren\r\nHastings, to obviate the bad effects of his first motion for the\r\nguaranty by a second motion, namely, \"That a letter be written to\r\nFyzoola Khân from myself, _confirming the obligations of the Company as\r\nguaranties_ to the treaty formed between him and the Vizier,--which will\r\nbe equivalent in its effect, though not in form, to an engagement sent\r\nhim with the Company's seal affixed to it.\"\r\n\r\nXII.[23] That, whether the guaranty aforesaid was or was not necessary,\r\nwhether it created a new obligation or but more fully recognized an\r\nobligation previously existing, the Governor-General, Warren Hastings,\r\nby the said guaranty, did, in the most explicit manner, pledge and\r\ncommit the public faith of the Company and the nation; and that by the\r\nsubsequent letter of the said Hastings (which he at his own motion\r\nwrote, confirming to Fyzoola Khân the aforesaid guaranty) the said\r\nHastings did again pledge and commit the public faith of the Company and\r\nthe nation, in a manner (as the said Hastings himself remarked)\r\n\"equivalent to an engagement with the Company's seal affixed to it,\" and\r\nmore particularly binding the said Hastings personally to exact a due\r\nobservance of the guarantied treaty, especially to protect the Nabob\r\nFyzoola Khân against any arbitrary construction or unwarranted\r\nrequisition of the Vizier.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IV.\r\n\r\nTHANKS OF THE BOARD TO FYZOOLA KHÂN.\r\n\r\nI. That, soon after the completion of the guaranty, in the same year,\r\n1778, intelligence was received in India of a war between England and\r\nFrance; that, on the first intimation thereof, the Nabob Fyzoola Khân,\r\n\"being indirectly sounded,\" did show much \"promptness to render the\r\nCompany any assistance within the bounds of his finances and ability\";\r\nand that by the suggestion of the Resident, Middleton, hereinbefore\r\nnamed, he, the Nabob Fyzoola Khân, in a letter to the Governor-General\r\nand Council, did make a voluntary \"offer to maintain two thousand\r\ncavalry (all he had) for our service,\" \"though he was under no\r\nobligation to furnish the Company with a single man.\"\r\n\r\nII. That the Nabob Fyzoola Khân did even \"anticipate the wishes of the\r\nboard\"; and that, \"on an application made to him by Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nMuir,\" the Nabob Fyzoola Khân did, \"without hesitation or delay,\"\r\nfurnish him, the said Muir, with five hundred of his best cavalry.\r\n\r\nThat the said conduct of the Nabob Fyzoola Khân was communicated by the\r\nCompany's servants both to each other and to their employers, with\r\nexpressions of \"pleasure\" and \"particular satisfaction,\" as an event\r\n\"even surpassing their expectations\"; that the Governor-General, Warren\r\nHastings, was officially requested to convoy \"the thanks of the board\";\r\nand that, not satisfied with the bare discharge of his duty under the\r\nsaid request, he, the said Hastings, did, on the 8th of January, 1779,\r\nwrite to Fyzoola, \"that, _in his own name_,\" as well as \"that of the\r\nboard, he [the said Hastings] returned him the _warmest_ thanks for this\r\ninstance of his faithful attachment to the Company and the English\r\nnation.\"\r\n\r\nIV.[24] That by the strong expressions above recited the said Warren\r\nHastings did deliberately and emphatically add his own particular\r\nconfirmation to the general testimony of the Nabob Fyzoola Khân's\r\nmeritorious fidelity, and of his consequent claim on the generosity, no\r\nless than the justice, of the British government.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART V.\r\n\r\nDEMAND OF FIVE THOUSAND HORSE.\r\n\r\nI. That, notwithstanding his own private honor thus deeply engaged,\r\nnotwithstanding the public justice and generosity of the Company and the\r\nnation thus solemnly committed, disregarding the plain import and\r\npositive terms of the guarantied treaty, the Governor-General, Warren\r\nHastings aforesaid, in November, 1780, while a body of Fyzoola Khân's\r\ncavalry, voluntarily granted, were still serving under a British\r\nofficer, did recommend to the Vizier \"to require from Fyzoola Khân the\r\nquota of troops stipulated by treaty to be furnished by the latter for\r\nhis [the Vizier's] service, being FIVE THOUSAND HORSE,\" though, as the\r\nVizier did not march in person, he was not, under any construction of\r\nthe treaty, entitled by stipulation to more than \"_two or three thousand\r\ntroops_,\" horse and foot, \"according to the ability of Fyzoola Khân\";\r\nand that, whereas the said Warren Hastings would have been guilty of\r\nvery criminal perfidy, if he had simply neglected to interfere as a\r\nguaranty against a demand thus plainly contrary to the faith of treaty,\r\nso he aggravated the guilt of his perfidy in the most atrocious degree\r\nby being himself the first mover and instigator of that injustice, which\r\nhe was bound by so many ties on himself, the Company, and the nation,\r\nnot only not to promote, but, by every exertion of authority, influence,\r\nand power, to control, to divert, or to resist.\r\n\r\nII. That the answer of Fyzoola Khân to the Vizier did represent, with\r\nmany expressions of deference, duty, and allegiance, that the whole\r\nforce allowed him was but \"five thousand men,\" and that \"these consisted\r\nof two thousand horse and three thousand foot; which,\" he adds, \"in\r\nconsequence of our intimate connection, are equally yours and the\r\nCompany's\": though he does subsequently intimate, that \"the three\r\nthousand foot are for the management of the concerns of his jaghire, and\r\nwithout them the collections can never be made in time.\"\r\n\r\nThat, on the communication of the said answer to the Governor-General,\r\nWarren Hastings, he, the said Hastings, (who, as the Council now\r\nconsisted only of himself and Edward Wheler, Esquire, \"united in his own\r\nperson all the powers of government,\") was not induced to relax from his\r\nunjust purpose, but did proceed with new violence to record, that \"the\r\nNabob Fyzoola Khân _had evaded the performance of his part of the\r\ntreaty_ between the late Nabob Sujah ul Dowlah and him, to which the\r\nHonorable Company were guaranties, and upon which he was lately summoned\r\nto furnish the stipulated number of troops, which he is obliged to\r\nfurnish on the condition by which he holds the jaghire granted to him.\"\r\n\r\nThat, by the vague and indefinite term of evasion, the said Warren\r\nHastings did introduce a loose and arbitrary principle of interpreting\r\nformal engagements, which ought to be regarded, more especially by\r\nguaranties, ill a sense the most literally scrupulous and precise.\r\n\r\nThat he charged with such evasion a moderate, humble, and submissive\r\nrepresentation on a point which would have warranted a peremptory\r\nrefusal and a positive remonstrance; and that in consequence of the said\r\nimputed evasion he indicated a disposition to attach such a forfeiture\r\nas in justice could only have followed from a gross breach of\r\ntreaty,--though the said Hastings did not then pretend any actual\r\ninfringement even of the least among the conditions to which, in the\r\nname of the Company, he, the said Hastings, was the executive guaranty.\r\n\r\nIII. That, however \"the number of troops stipulated by treaty may have\r\nbeen understood,\" at the period of the original demand, \"to be five\r\nthousand horse,\" yet the said Warren Hastings, at the time when he\r\nrecorded the supposed evasion of Fyzoola Khân's answer to the said\r\ndemand, could not be unacquainted with the express words of the\r\nstipulation, as a letter of the Vizier, inserted in the same\r\nConsultation, refers the Governor-General to inclosed copies \"of all\r\nengagements entered into by the late Vizier and by himself [the\r\nreigning Vizier] with Fyzoola Khân,\" and that the treaty itself,\r\ntherefore, was at the very moment before the said Warren Hastings: which\r\ntreaty (as the said Hastings observed with respect to another treaty, in\r\nthe case of another person) \"most assuredly does not contain a syllable\r\nto justify his conduct; but, by the unexampled latitude which he assumes\r\nin his constructions, he may, if he pleases, extort this or any other\r\nmeaning from any part of it.\"[25]\r\n\r\nIV. That the Vizier himself appears by no means to have been persuaded\r\nof his own right to five thousand horse under the treaty,--since, in his\r\ncorrespondence on the subject, he, the Vizier, nowhere mentions the\r\ntreaty as the ground of his demand, except where he is recapitulating to\r\nthe Governor-General, Warren Hastings, the substance of his, the said\r\nHastings's, own letters; on the contrary, the Vizier hints his\r\napprehensions lest Fyzoola Khân should appeal to the treaty against the\r\ndemand, as a breach thereof,--in which case, he, the Vizier, informs the\r\nsaid Hastings of the projected reply. \"Should Fyzoola Khân\" (says the\r\nVizier) \"mention anything of the tenor of the treaty, _the first breach\r\nof it has been committed by him_, in keeping up more men than allowed of\r\nby the treaty: _I have accordingly sent a person to settle that point\r\nalso_. In case he should mention to me anything respecting the treaty, I\r\nwill then reproach him with having kept up too many troops, and will\r\noblige him to send the five thousand horse\": thereby clearly intimating,\r\nthat, as a remonstrance against the demand as a breach of treaty could\r\nonly be answered by charging a prior breach of treaty on Fyzoola Khân,\r\nso by annulling the whole treaty to reduce the question to a mere\r\nquestion of force, and thus \"oblige Fyzoola Khân to send the five\r\nthousand horse\": \"for,\" (continues the Vizier,) \"if, when the Company's\r\naffairs, on which my honor depends, require it, Fyzoola Khân will not\r\nlend his assistance, _what_ USE _is there to continue the country to\r\nhim_?\"\r\n\r\nThat the Vizier actually did make his application to Fyzoola Khân for\r\nthe five thousand horse, not as for an aid to which he had a just claim,\r\nbut as for something over and above the obligations of the treaty,\r\nsomething \"that would give increase to their friendship and satisfaction\r\nto the Nabob Governor,\" (meaning the said Hastings,) whose directions he\r\nrepresents as the motive \"of his call for the five thousand horse to be\r\nemployed,\" not in his, the Vizier's, \"but in the Company's service.\"\r\n\r\nAnd that the aforesaid Warren Hastings did, therefore, in recording the\r\nanswer of Fyzoola Khân as an evasion of treaty, act in notorious\r\ncontradiction not only to that which ought to have been the fair\r\nconstruction of the said treaty, but to that which he, the said\r\nHastings, must have known to be the Vizier's own interpretation of the\r\nsame, disposed as the Vizier was \"to reproach Fyzoola Khân with breach\r\nof treaty,\" and to \"send up persons who should settle points with him.\"\r\n\r\nV. That the said Warren Hastings, not thinking himself justified, on the\r\nmere plea of an evasion, to push forward his proceedings to that\r\nextremity which he seems already to have made his scope and object, and\r\nseeking some better color for his unjust and violent purposes, did\r\nfurther move, that commissioners should be sent from the Vizier and the\r\nCompany to Fyzoola Khân, to insist on a clause of a treaty which nowhere\r\nappears, being essentially different from the treaty of Lall-Dang,\r\nthough not in the part on which the requisition is founded; and the said\r\nHastings did then, in a style unusually imperative, proceed as follows.\r\n\r\n\"_Demand immediate delivery of three thousand cavalry; and if he should\r\nevade or refuse compliance, that the deputies shall deliver him a formal\r\nprotest against him for breach of treaty_, and return, making this\r\nreport to the Vizier, which Mr. Middleton is to transmit to the board.\"\r\n\r\nVI. That the said motion of the Governor-General, Hastings, was ordered\r\naccordingly,--the Council, as already has been herein related,\r\nconsisting but of two members, and the said Hastings consequently\r\n\"uniting in his own person all the powers of government.\"\r\n\r\nVII. That, when the said Hastings ordered the said demand for three\r\nthousand cavalry, he, the said Hastings, well knew that a compliance\r\ntherewith, on the part of the Nabob Fyzoola Khân, was utterly\r\nimpossible: for he, the said Hastings, had at the very moment before him\r\na letter of Fyzoola Khân, stating, that he, Fyzoola Khân, had \"but two\r\nthousand cavalry\" altogether; which letter is entered on the records of\r\nthe Company, in the same Consultation, immediately preceding the\r\nGovernor-General's minute. That the said Hastings, therefore, knew that\r\nthe only possible consequence of the aforesaid demand necessarily and\r\ninevitably must be a protest for a breach of treaty; and the Court of\r\nDirectors did not hesitate to declare that the said demand \"carried the\r\nappearance of a determination to create a pretext for depriving him\r\n[Fyzoola Khân] of his jaghire entirely, or to leave him at the mercy of\r\nthe Vizier.\"\r\n\r\nVIII. That Richard Johnson, Esquire, Assistant Resident at Oude, was,\r\nagreeably to the afore-mentioned order of Council, deputed commissioner\r\nfrom Mr. Middleton and the Vizier to Fyzoola Khân; but that he did early\r\ngive the most indecent proofs of glaring partiality, to the prejudice of\r\nthe said Fyzoola Khân: for that the very next day (as it seems) after\r\nhis arrival, he, the said Johnson, from opinions imbibed in his journey,\r\ndid state himself to be \"unwilling to draw any favorable or flattering\r\ninferences relatively to the object of his mission,\" and did studiously\r\nseek to find new breaches of treaty, and, without any form of regular\r\ninquiry whatever, from a single glance of his eye in passing, did take\r\nupon himself to pronounce \"the Rohilla soldiers, in the district of\r\nRampoor alone, to be not less than twenty thousand,\" and the grant of\r\ncourse to be forfeited. And that such a gross and palpable display of a\r\npredetermination to discover guilt did argue in the said Johnson a\r\nknowledge, a strong presumption, or a belief, that such representations\r\nwould be agreeable to the secret wishes and views of the said Hastings,\r\nunder whose orders he, the said Johnson, acted, and to whom all his\r\nreports were to be referred.\r\n\r\nIX. That the said Richard Johnson, did soon after proceed to the\r\nimmediate object of his mission, \"which\" (the said Johnson relates)\r\n\"was short to a degree.\" The demand was made, and \"a flat refusal\"\r\ngiven. The question was repeated, with like effect. The said Johnson, in\r\npresence of proper witnesses, then drew up his protest, \"together with a\r\nmemorandum of _a palliative offer_ made by the Nabob Fyzoola Khân,\" and\r\ninserted in the protest:--\"That he would, in compliance with the demand,\r\nand _in conformity to the treaty, which specified no definite number of\r\ncavalry or infantry, only expressing troops_, furnish three thousand\r\nmen: viz., he would, in addition to the one thousand cavalry already\r\ngranted, give one thousand more, when and wheresoever required, and one\r\nthousand foot,\"--together with one year's pay in advance, and funds for\r\nthe regular payment of them in future.\r\n\r\nAnd this, the said Richard Johnson observes, \"I put down at his [the\r\nNabob Fyzoola Khân's] particular desire, but otherwise useless; as _my\r\norders_\" (which orders do not appear) \"_were, not to receive any\r\npalliation, but a negative or affirmative_\": though such palliation, as\r\nit is called by the said Johnson, might be, as it was, in the strictest\r\nconformity to the treaty.\r\n\r\nX. That in the said offer the Nabob Fyzoola Khân, instead of palliating,\r\ndid at once admit the extreme right of the Vizier under the treaty, by\r\nagreeing to furnish three thousand men, when he, Fyzoola Khân, would\r\nhave been justified in pleading his inability to send more than two\r\nthousand; that such inability would not (as appears) have been a false\r\nand evasive plea, but perfectly true and valid,--as the three thousand\r\nfoot maintained by Fyzoola Khân were for the purposes of his internal\r\ngovernment, for which the whole three thousand must have been\r\ndemonstrably necessary; and that the Nabob Fyzoola Khân, by declining to\r\navail himself of a plea so fair, so well founded, and so consonant to\r\nthe indulgence expressly acknowledged in the treaty, and by thus meeting\r\nthe specific demand of the Vizier as fully as, according to his own\r\nmilitary establishment, he could, did for the said offer deserve rather\r\nthe thanks of the said Vizier and the Company than the protest which the\r\naforesaid Johnson, under the orders of Warren Hastings, did deliver.\r\n\r\nXI. That the report of the said protest, as well as the former letter of\r\nthe said Johnson, were by the Resident, Middleton, transmitted to the\r\nboard, together with a letter from the Vizier, founded on the said\r\nreport and letter of the said Johnson, and proposing in consequence \"to\r\nresume the grant, and to leave Fyzoola Khân to join his other faithless\r\nbrethren who were sent across the Ganges.\"\r\n\r\nThat the said papers were read in Council on the 4th of June, 1781, when\r\nthe Governor-General, Warren Hastings, did move and carry a vote to\r\nsuspend a final resolution on the same: and the said Hastings did not\r\nexpress any disapprobation of the proceedings of the said Johnson;\r\nneither did the said Hastings assign any reasons for his motion of\r\nsuspension, which passed without debate. That in truth the said Hastings\r\nhad then projected a journey up the country to meet the Vizier for the\r\nsettlement of articles relative to the regulation of Oude and its\r\ndependencies, among which was included the jaghire of Fyzoola Khân; and\r\nthe said Hastings, for the aforesaid purposes, did, on the 3d of July,\r\nby his own casting vote, grant to himself, and did prevail on his\r\ncolleague, Edward Wheler, Esquire, to grant, a certain illegal\r\ndelegation of the whole powers of the Governor-General and Council, and\r\non the seventh of the same month did proceed on his way to join the\r\nVizier at a place called Chunar, on the borders of Benares; and that the\r\naforesaid vote of suspending a final resolution on the transactions with\r\nFyzoola Khân was therefore in substance and effect a reference thereof\r\nby the said Hastings from himself in council with his colleague, Wheler,\r\nto himself in conference and negotiation with the Vizier, who, from the\r\nfirst demand of the five thousand horse, had taken every occasion of\r\nshowing his inclination to dispossess Fyzoola Khân, and who before the\r\nsaid demand (in a letter which does not appear, but which the Vizier\r\nhimself quotes as antecedent to the said demand) had complained to the\r\nsaid Hastings of the \"injury and irregularity in the management of the\r\nprovinces bordering on Rampoor, arising from Fyzoola Khân having the\r\nuncontrolled dominion of that district.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPART VI.\r\n\r\nTREATY OF CHUNAR.\r\n\r\nI. That the Governor-General, Warren Hastings, being vested with the\r\nillegal powers before recited, did, on the 19th of September, 1781,\r\nenter into a treaty with the Vizier at Chunar,--which treaty (as the\r\nsaid Hastings relates) was drawn up \"from a series of requisitions\r\npresented to him [the said Hastings] by the Vizier,\" and by him received\r\n\"with an instant and unqualified assent to each article\"; and that the\r\nsaid Hastings assigns his reasons for such ready assent in the\r\nfollowing words: \"I considered the subjects of his [the Vizier's]\r\nrequests as essential to the reputation of our government, and no less\r\nto our interest than his.\"\r\n\r\nII. That in the said treaty of Chunar the third article is as follows.\r\n\r\n\"That, as Fyzoola Khân has by his breach of treaty forfeited the\r\nprotection of the English government, and causes by his continuance in\r\nhis present independent state great alarm and detriment to the Nabob\r\nVizier, he be permitted, _when time shall suit_, to resume his lands,\r\nand pay him in money, through the Resident, the amount stipulated by\r\ntreaty, after deducting the amount and charges of the troops he stands\r\nengaged to furnish by treaty; which amount shall be passed to the\r\naccount of the Company during the continuance of the present war.\"\r\n\r\nIII. That, for the better elucidation of his policy in the several\r\narticles of the treaty above mentioned, the said Hastings did send to\r\nthe Council of Calcutta (now consisting of Edward Wheler and John\r\nMacpherson, Esquires) two different copies of the said treaty, with\r\nexplanatory minutes opposed to each article; and that the minute opposed\r\nto the third article is thus expressed.\r\n\r\n\"The conduct of Fyzoola Khân, in refusing the aid demanded, though (1.)\r\n_not an absolute breach of treaty_, was evasive and uncandid. (2.) _The\r\ndemand was made for five thousand cavalry_. (3.) _The engagement, in the\r\ntreaty is literally for five thousand horse and foot_. Fyzoola Khân\r\ncould not be ignorant that we had no occasion for any succors of\r\ninfantry from him, and that cavalry would be of the most essential\r\nservice. (4.) _So scrupulous an attention to literal expression, when a\r\nmore liberal interpretation would have been highly useful and acceptable\r\nto us, strongly marks his unfriendly disposition, though it may not\r\nimpeach his fidelity, and leaves him little claim to any exertions from\r\nus for the continuance of his jaghires. But _ (5.) _I am of opinion that\r\nneither the Vizier's nor the Company's interests would be promoted by\r\ndepriving Fyzoola Khân of his independency, and I have_ (6.) _therefore\r\nreserved the execution of this agreement to an indefinite term; and our\r\ngovernment may always interpose to prevent any ill effects from it_.\"\r\n\r\nIV. That, in his aforesaid authentic evidence of his own purposes,\r\nmotives, and principles, in the third article of the treaty of Chunar,\r\nthe said Hastings hath established divers matters of weighty and serious\r\ncrimination against himself.\r\n\r\n1st. That the said Hastings doth acknowledge therein, that he did, in a\r\npublic instrument, solemnly recognize, \"_as a breach of treaty_,\" and as\r\nsuch did subject to the consequent penalties, an act which he, the said\r\nHastings, did at the same time think, and did immediately declare, to be\r\n\"_no breach of treaty_\"; and by so falsely and unjustly proceeding\r\nagainst a person under the Company's guaranty, the said Hastings, on his\r\nown confession, did himself break the faith of the said guaranty.\r\n\r\n2d. That, in justifying this breach of the Company's faith, the said\r\nHastings doth _wholly abandon his second peremptory demand for the three\r\nthousand horse_, and the protest consequent thereon; and the said\r\nHastings doth thereby himself condemn the violence and injustice of the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\n3dly. That, in recurring to the original demand of five thousand horse\r\nas the ground of his justification, the said Hastings doth falsely\r\nassert \"the engagement in the treaty to be _literally_ FIVE _thousand\r\nhorse and foot_,\" whereas it is in fact for TWO _or_ THREE _thousand\r\nmen_; and the said Hastings doth thereby wilfully attempt to deceive and\r\nmislead his employers, which is an high crime and misdemeanor in a\r\nservant of so great trust.\r\n\r\n4thly. That, with a view to his further justification, the said Hastings\r\ndoth advance a principle that \"_a scrupulous attention to the literal\r\nexpression_\" of a guarantied treaty \"_leaves_\" to the person so\r\nobserving the same \"_but little claim to the exertions_\" _of a guaranty\r\non his behalf_; that such a principle is utterly subversive of all faith\r\nof guaranties, and is therefore highly criminal in the first executive\r\nmember of a government that must necessarily stand in that mutual\r\nrelation to many.\r\n\r\n5thly. That the said Hastings doth profess his opinion of an article to\r\nwhich he gave an \"_instant and unqualified assent_,\" that it was a\r\nmeasure \"_by which neither the Vizier's nor the Company's interests\r\nwould be promoted_,\" but from which, without some interposition, \"_ill\r\neffects_\" _must be expected_; and that the said Hastings doth thereby\r\ncharge himself with a high breach of trust towards his employers.\r\n\r\n6thly. That the said Hastings having thus confessed that consciously and\r\nwilfully (from what motives he hath not chosen to confess) he did give\r\nhis formal sanction to a measure both of injustice and impolicy, he, the\r\nsaid Hastings, doth urge in his defence, that he did at the same time\r\ninsert words \"reserving the execution of the said agreement to an\r\nindefinite term,\" with an intent that it might in truth be never\r\nexecuted at all,--but that \"our government might always interpose,\"\r\nwithout right, by means of an indirect and undue influence, to prevent\r\nthe ill effects following from a collusive surrender of a clear and\r\nauthorized right to interpose; and the said Hastings doth thereby\r\ndeclare himself to have introduced a principle of duplicity, deceit, and\r\ndouble-dealing into a public engagement, which ought in its essence to\r\nbe clear, open, and explicit; that such a declaration tends to shake and\r\noverthrow the confidence of all in the most solemn instruments of any\r\nperson so declaring, and is therefore an high crime and misdemeanor in\r\nthe first executive member of government, by whom all treaties and other\r\nengagements of the state are principally to be conducted.\r\n\r\nV. That, by the explanatory minute aforesaid, the said Warren Hastings\r\ndoth further, in the most direct manner, contradict his own assertions\r\nin the very letter which inclosed the said minute to his colleagues; for\r\nthat one of the articles to which he there gave \"_an instant and\r\nunqualified assent, as no less to our interest than to the Vizier's_\" he\r\ndoth here declare unequivocally to be _neither to our interests nor the\r\nVizier's_; and the \"_unqualified_ assent\" given to the said article is\r\nnow so _qualified_ as wholly to defeat itself. That by such\r\nirreconcilable contradictions the said Hastings doth incur the suspicion\r\nof much criminal misrepresentation in other like cases of unwitnessed\r\nconferences; and in the present instance (as far as it extends) the said\r\nHastings doth prove himself to have given an account both of his actions\r\nand motives by his own confession untrue, for the purpose of deceiving\r\nhis employers, which is an high crime and misdemeanor in a servant of so\r\ngreat trust.\r\n\r\nVI. That the said third article of the treaty of Chunar, as it thus\r\nstands explained by the said Hastings himself, doth on the whole appear\r\ndesigned to hold the protection of the Company in suspense; that it\r\nacknowledges all right of interference to cease, but leaves it to our\r\ndiscretion to determine when it will suit our conveniency to give the\r\nVizier the liberty of acting on the principles by us already admitted;\r\nthat it is dexterously constructed to balance the desires of one man,\r\nrapacious and profuse, against the fears of another, described as \"of\r\nextreme pusillanimity and wealthy,\" but that, whatever may have been the\r\nsecret objects of the artifice and intrigue confessed to form its very\r\nessence, it must on the very face of it necessarily implicate the\r\nCompany in a breach of faith, whichever might be the event, as they must\r\nequally break their faith either by withdrawing their guaranty unjustly\r\nor by continuing that guaranty in contradiction to this treaty of\r\nChunar; that it thus tends to hold out to India, and to the whole world,\r\nthat the public principle of the English government is a deliberate\r\nsystem of injustice joined with falsehood, of impolicy, of bad faith,\r\nand treachery; and that the said article is therefore in the highest\r\ndegree derogatory to the honor, and injurious to the interests of this\r\nnation.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART VII.\r\n\r\nCONSEQUENCES OF THE TREATY OF CHUNAR.\r\n\r\nI. That, in consequence of the treaty of Chunar, the Governor-General,\r\nWarren Hastings, did send official instructions respecting the various\r\narticles of the said treaty to the said Resident, Middleton; and that,\r\nin a postscript, the said Hastings did forbid the resumption of the\r\nNabob Fyzoola Khân's jaghire, \"until circumstances may render it more\r\nexpedient and easy to be attempted than the present more material\r\npursuits of government make it appear\": thereby intimating a positive\r\nlimitation of the indefinite term in the explanatory minute above\r\nrecited, and confining the suspension of the article to the pressure of\r\nthe war.\r\n\r\nII. That, soon after the date of the said instructions, and within two\r\nmonths of the signature of the treaty of Chunar, the said Hastings did\r\ncause Sir Elijah Impey, Knight, his Majesty's chief-justice at Fort\r\nWilliam, to discredit the justice of the crown of Great Britain by\r\nmaking him the channel of unwarrantable communication, and did, through\r\nthe said Sir Elijah, signify to the Resident, Middleton, his, the said\r\nHastings's, \"approbation of a _subsidy_ from Fyzoola Khân.\"\r\n\r\nIII. That the Resident, in answer, represents the proper equivalent for\r\ntwo thousand horse and one thousand foot (the forces offered to Mr.\r\nJohnson by Fyzoola Khân) to be twelve lacs, or 120,000_l._ sterling and\r\nupwards, each year; which the said Resident supposes is considerably\r\nbeyond what he, Fyzoola Khân, _will voluntarily pay_: \"however, if it\r\nis your wish that the claim should be made, I am ready to take it up,\r\nand _you may he assured nothing in my power shall be left undone to\r\ncarry it through_.\"\r\n\r\nIV. That the reply of the said Hastings doth not appear; but that it\r\ndoes appear on record that \"a negotiation\" (Mr. Johnson's) \"was begun\r\nfor Fyzoola Khân's cavalry to act with General Goddard, and, on his\r\n[Fyzoola Khân's] _evading_ it, _that a sum of money was demanded_.\"\r\n\r\nV. That, in the months of February, March, and April, the Resident,\r\nMiddleton, did repeatedly propose the resumption of Fyzoola Khân's\r\njaghire, agreeably to the treaty of Chunar; and that, driven to\r\nextremity (as the said Hastings supposes) \"by the public menaces and\r\ndenunciations of the Resident and minister,\" Hyder Beg Khân, a creature\r\nof the said Hastings, and both the minister and Resident acting\r\nprofessedly on and under the treaty of Chunar, \"the Nabob Fyzoola Khân\r\nmade such preparations, and such a disposition of his family and wealth,\r\nas evidently manifested either an intended or an _expected rupture_.\"\r\n\r\nVI. That on the 6th of May the said Hastings did send his confidential\r\nagent and friend, Major Palmer, on a private commission to Lucknow; and\r\nthat the said Palmer was charged with secret instructions relative to\r\nFyzoola Khân, but of what import cannot be ascertained, the said\r\nHastings in his public instructions having inserted only the name of\r\nFyzoola Khân, as a mere reference (according to the explanation of the\r\nsaid Hastings) to what he had verbally communicated to the said Palmer;\r\nand that the said Hastings was thereby guilty of a criminal concealment.\r\n\r\nVII. That some time about the month of August an engagement happened\r\nbetween a body of Fyzoola Khân's cavalry and a part of the Vizier's\r\narmy, in which the latter were beaten, and their guns taken; that the\r\nResident, Middleton, did represent the same but as a slight and\r\naccidental affray; that it was acknowledged the troops of the Vizier\r\nwere the aggressors; that it did appear to the board, and to the said\r\nHastings himself, an affair of more considerable magnitude; and that\r\nthey did make the concealment thereof an article of charge against the\r\nResident, Middleton, though the said Resident did in truth acquaint them\r\nwith the same, but in a cursory manner.\r\n\r\nVIII. That, immediately after the said \"fray\" at Daranagur, the Vizier\r\n(who was \"but a cipher in the hands\" of the minister and the Resident,\r\nboth of them directly appointed and supported by the said Hastings) did\r\nmake of Fyzoola Khân a new demand, equally contrary to the true intent\r\nand meaning of the treaty as his former requisitions: which new demand\r\nwas for the detachment in garrison at Daranagur to be cantoned as a\r\nstationary force at Lucknow, the capital of the Vizier; whereas he, the\r\nVizier, had only a right to demand an occasional aid to join his army in\r\nthe field or in garrison during a war. But the said new demand being\r\n_evaded_, or rather refused, agreeably to the fair construction of the\r\ntreaty, by the Nabob Fyzoola Khân, the matter was for the present\r\ndropped.\r\n\r\nIX. That in the letter in which the Resident, Middleton, did mention\r\n\"what he calls the fray\" aforesaid, the said Middleton did again apply\r\nfor the resumption of the jaghire of Rampoor; and that, the objections\r\nagainst the measure being now removed, (by the separate peace with\r\nSindia,) he desired to know if the board \"would give assurances of their\r\nsupport to the Vizier, in case, _which_\" (says the Resident) \"_I think\r\nvery probable, his_ [the Vizier's] _own strength should be found unequal\r\nto the undertaking_.\"\r\n\r\nX. That, although the said Warren Hastings did make the foregoing\r\napplication a new charge against the Resident, Middleton, yet the said\r\nHastings did only criminate the said Middleton for a proposal tending\r\n\"at such a crisis to increase the number of our enemies,\" and did in no\r\ndegree, either in his articles of charge or in his accompanying minutes,\r\nexpress any disapprobation whatever of the principle; that, in truth,\r\nthe whole proceedings of the said Resident were the natural result of\r\nthe treaty of Chunar; that the said proceedings were from time to time\r\ncommunicated to the said Hastings; that, as he nowhere charges any\r\ndisobedience of orders on Mr. Middleton with respect to Fyzoola Khân, it\r\nmay be justly inferred that the said Hastings did not interfere to check\r\nthe proceedings of the said Middleton on that subject; and that by such\r\ncriminal neglect the said Hastings did make the guilt of the said\r\nMiddleton, whatever it might be, his own.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART VIII.\r\n\r\nPECUNIARY COMMUTATION OF THE STIPULATED AID.\r\n\r\nI. That on the charges and for the misdemeanors above specified,\r\ntogether with divers other accusations, the Governor-General, Warren\r\nHastings, in September, 1782, did remove the aforesaid Middleton from\r\nhis office of Resident at Oude, and did appoint thereto John Bristow,\r\nEsquire, whom he had twice before, without cause, recalled from the\r\nsame; and that about the same time the said Hastings did believe the\r\nmind of the Nabob Fyzoola Khân to be so irritated, in consequence of the\r\nabove-recited conduct of the late Resident, Middleton, and of his, the\r\nsaid Hastings's, own criminal neglect, that he, the said Hastings, found\r\nit necessary to write to Fyzoola Khân, assuring him \"of the favorable\r\ndisposition of the government toward him, while he shall not have\r\nforfeited it by any improper conduct\"; but that the said assurances of\r\nthe Governor-General did not tend, as soon after appeared, to raise much\r\nconfidence in the Nabob, over whom a public instrument of the same\r\nHastings was still holding the terrors of a deprivation of his jaghire,\r\nand an exile \"among his other faithless brethren across the Ganges.\"\r\n\r\nII. That, on the subject of Fyzoola Khân, the said Hastings, in his\r\ninstructions to the new Resident, Bristow, did leave him to be guided by\r\nhis own discretion; but he adds, \"Be careful to prevent the Vizier's\r\naffairs from being involved with new difficulties, while he has already\r\nso many to oppress him\": thereby plainly hinting at some more decisive\r\nmeasures, whenever the Vizier should be less oppressed with\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\nIII. That the Resident, Bristow, after acquainting the Governor-General\r\nwith his intentions, did under the said instructions renew the aforesaid\r\nclaim for a sum of money, but with much caution and circumspection,\r\ndistantly sounding Allif Khân, the _vakeel_ (or envoy) of Fyzoola Khân\r\nat the court of the Vizier; that \"Allif Khân wrote to his master on the\r\nsubject, and in answer he was directed not to agree to the granting of\r\nany pecuniary aid.\"\r\n\r\nIV. That the Resident, Bristow, did then openly depute Major Palmer\r\naforesaid, with the concurrence of the Vizier, and the approbation of\r\nthe Governor-General, to the Nabob Fyzoola Khân, at Rampoor; and that\r\nthe said Palmer was to \"endeavor to convince the Nabob that _all doubts\r\nof his attachment to the Vizier are ceased, and whatever claims may be\r\nmade on him are founded upon the basis of his interest and advantage and\r\na plan of establishing his right to the possession of his jaghire_.\"\r\n\r\nThat the sudden ceasing of the said doubts, without any inquiry of the\r\nslightest kind, doth warrant a strong presumption of the Resident's\r\nconviction that they never really existed, but were artfully feigned, as\r\na pretence for some harsh interposition; and that the indecent mockery\r\nof establishing, as a matter of favor, for a pecuniary consideration,\r\nrights which were never impeached but by the treaty of Chunar, (an\r\ninstrument recorded by Warren Hastings himself to be founded on\r\nfalsehood and injustice,) doth powerfully prove the true purpose and\r\nobject of all the duplicity, deceit, and double-dealing with which that\r\ntreaty was projected and executed.\r\n\r\nV. That the said Palmer was instructed by the Resident, Bristow, with\r\nthe subsequent approbation of the Governor-General, \"to obtain from\r\nFyzoola Khân _an annual tribute_\"; to which the Resident adds,--\"_If\r\nyou can procure from him, over and above this, a peshcush_ [or fine] _of\r\nat least five lacs_, it would be rendering an essential service to the\r\nVizier, and add to _the confidence his Excellency would hereafter repose\r\nin the attachment of the Nabob Fyzoola Khân_.\" And that the said\r\nGovernor-General, Hastings, did give the following extraordinary ground\r\nof calculation, as the basis of the said Palmer's negotiation for the\r\nannual tribute aforesaid.\r\n\r\n\"_It was certainly understood_, at the time the treaty was concluded,\r\n(of which this stipulation was a part,) that it applied _solely to\r\ncavalry_: as the Nabob Vizier, possessing the service of our forces,\r\ncould not possibly require infantry, and least of all such infantry as\r\nFyzoola Khân could furnish; and _a single horseman included in the aid\r\nwhich Fyzoola Khân might furnish would prove a literal compliance with\r\nthe said stipulation_. The number, therefore, of horse implied by it\r\nought at least to be ascertained: _we will suppose five thousand_, and,\r\nallowing the exigency for their attendance to exist only in the\r\nproportion of _one year in five_, reduce the demand to one thousand for\r\nthe computation of the subsidy, which, at the rate of _fifty rupees_ per\r\nman, will amount to fifty thousand _per mensem_. This may serve for the\r\nbasis of this article in the negotiation upon it.\"\r\n\r\nVI. That the said Warren Hastings doth then continue to instruct the\r\nsaid Palmer in the alternative of a refusal from Fyzoola Khân. \"If\r\nFyzoola Khân shall refuse to treat for a subsidy, and claim the benefit\r\nof his original agreement in its literal expression, _he possesses a\r\nright which we cannot dispute_, and it will in that case remain only to\r\nfix the precise number of horse which he shall furnish, which ought at\r\nleast to exceed twenty-five hundred.\"\r\n\r\nVII. That, in the above-recited instruction, the said Warren Hastings\r\ndoth insinuate (for he doth not directly assert),--\r\n\r\n1st. That we are entitled by treaty to five thousand troops, which he\r\nsays were undoubtedly intended to be all cavalry.\r\n\r\n2d. That the said Hastings doth then admit that a single horseman,\r\nincluded in the aid furnished by Fyzoola Khân, would prove a literal\r\ncompliance.\r\n\r\n3d. That the said Hastings doth next resort again to the supposition of\r\nour right to the whole five thousand cavalry.\r\n\r\n4th. That the said Hastings doth afterwards think, in the event of an\r\nexplanation of the treaty, and a settlement of the proportion of\r\ncavalry, instead of a pecuniary commutation, it will be all we can\r\ndemand that the number should _at least exceed twenty-five hundred_.\r\n\r\n5th. That the said Hastings doth, in calculating the supposed time of\r\ntheir service, assume an arbitrary estimate of one year of war to four\r\nof peace; which (however moderate the calculation may appear on the\r\naverage of the said Hastings's own government) doth involve a principle\r\nin a considerable degree repugnant to the system of perfect peace\r\ninculcated in the standing orders of the Company.\r\n\r\n6th. That, in estimating the pay of the cavalry to be commuted, the\r\nsaid Hastings doth fix the pay of each man at fifty rupees a month;\r\nwhich on five thousand troops, all cavalry, (as the said Hastings\r\nsupposes the treaty of Lall-Dang to have meant,) would amount to an\r\nexpense of thirty lacs a year, or between 300,000_l._ or 400,000_l._ And\r\nthis expense, strictly resulting (according to the calculations of the\r\nsaid Hastings) from the intention of Sujah ul Dowlah's grant to Fyzoola\r\nKhân, was designed to be supported out of a jaghire valued at fifteen\r\nlacs only, or something more than 150,000_l._ of yearly revenue, just\r\nhalf the amount of the expense to be incurred in consideration of the\r\nsaid jaghire.\r\n\r\nAnd that a basis of negotiation so inconsistent, so arbitrary, and so\r\nunjust is contrary to that uprightness and integrity which should mark\r\nthe transactions of a great state, and is highly derogatory to the honor\r\nof this nation.\r\n\r\nVIII. That, notwithstanding the seeming moderation and justice of the\r\nsaid Hastings in admitting the clear and undoubted right of Fyzoola Khân\r\nto insist on his treaty, the head of instruction immediately succeeding\r\ndoth afford just reason for a violent presumption that such apparent\r\nlenity was but policy, to give a color to his conduct: he, the said\r\nHastings, in the very next paragraph, bringing forth a new engine of\r\noppression, as follows.\r\n\r\n\"To demand the surrender of all the ryots [or peasants] of the Nabob\r\nVizier's dominions to whom Fyzoola has given protection and service, _or\r\nan annual tribute in compensation for the loss sustained by the Nabob\r\nVizier in his revenue thus transferred to Fyzoola Khân_.\r\n\r\n\"You have stated the increase of his jaghire, occasioned by this act,\r\nat the moderate sum of fifteen lacs. _The tribute ought at least to be\r\none third of that amount_.\r\n\r\n\"We conceive that Fyzoola Khân himself may be disposed to yield to the\r\npreceding demand, on the additional condition of being allowed to hold\r\nhis lands in _ultumgaw_ [or an inheritable tenure] instead of his\r\npresent tenure by _jaghire_ [or a tenure for life]. This we think the\r\nVizier can have no objection to grant, and we recommend it; _but for\r\nthis a fine, or peshcush, ought to be immediately paid, in the customary\r\nproportion of the jumma, estimated at thirty lacs_.\"\r\n\r\nIX. That the Resident, Bristow, (to whom the letter containing Major\r\nPalmer's instructions is addressed,) nowhere attributes the increase of\r\nFyzoola Khân's revenues to this protection of the fugitive ryots,\r\nsubjects of the Vizier; that the said Warren Hastings was, therefore,\r\nnot warranted to make that a pretext of such a peremptory demand. That,\r\nas an inducement to make Fyzoola Khân agree to the said demand, it is\r\noffered to settle his lands upon a tenure which would secure them to his\r\nchildren; but that settlement is to bring with it a new demand of a fine\r\nof thirty lacs, or 300,000_l._ and upwards; that the principles of the\r\nsaid demand are violent and despotic, and the inducement to acquiescence\r\ndeceitful and insidious; and that both the demand and the inducement are\r\nderogatory to the honor of this nation.\r\n\r\nX. That Major Palmer aforesaid proceeded under these instructions to\r\nRampoor, where his journey \"_to extort a sum of money_\" was previously\r\nknown from Allif Khân, vakeel of Fyzoola Khân at the Vizier's court; and\r\nthat, notwithstanding the assurances of the friendly disposition of\r\ngovernment given by the said Hastings, (as is herein related,) the Nabob\r\nFyzoola Khân did express the most serious and desponding apprehensions,\r\nboth by letter and through his vakeel, to the Resident, Bristow, who\r\nrepresents them to Major Palmer in the following manner.\r\n\r\n\"The Nabob Fyzoola Khân complains of the distresses he has this year\r\nsuffered from the drought. The whole collections have, with great\r\nmanagement, amounted to about twelve lacs of rupees, from which sum he\r\nhas to support his troops, his family, and several relations and\r\ndependants of the late Rohilla chiefs. _He says, it clearly appears to\r\nbe intended to deprive him of his country, as the high demand you have\r\nmade of him is inadmissible._ Should he have assented to it, it would be\r\nimpossible to perform the conditions, and then his reputation would be\r\ninjured by a breach of agreement. _Allif Khân further represents, that\r\nit is his master's intention, in case the demand should not be\r\nrelinquished by you, first to proceed to Lucknow, where he proposes\r\nhaving an interview with the Vizier and the Resident; if he should not\r\nbe able to obtain his own terms for a future possession of his jaghire,\r\nhe will set off for Calcutta in order to pray for justice from the\r\nHonorable the Governor-General._ He observes, it is the custom of the\r\nHonorable Company, when they deprive a chief of his country, to grant\r\nhim some allowance. This he expects from Mr. Hastings's bounty; _but if\r\nhe should be disappointed, he will certainly set off upon a pilgrimage\r\nto Mecca and Medina, and renounce the cares of the world_.--_He directs\r\nhis vakeel to ascertain whether the English intend to deprive him of his\r\ncountry_; for if they do, he is ready to surrender it, upon receiving an\r\norder from the Resident.\"\r\n\r\nXI. That, after much negotiation, the Nabob Fyzoola Khân, \"being fully\r\nsensible that an engagement to furnish military aid, _however clearly\r\nthe conditions might be stated, must be a source of perpetual\r\nmisunderstanding and inconveniencies_,\" did at length agree with Major\r\nPalmer to give fifteen lacs, or 150,000_l._ and upwards, by four\r\ninstalments, that he might be exempted from all future claims of\r\nmilitary service; that the said Palmer represents it to be his belief,\r\n\"_that no person, not known to possess your_ [the said Hastings's]\r\n_confidence and support in the degree that I am supposed to do_, would\r\nhave obtained nearly so good terms\"; but from what motive \"terms so\r\ngood\" were granted, and how the confidence and support of the said\r\nHastings did truly operate on the mind of Fyzoola Khân, doth appear to\r\nbe better explained by another passage in the same letter, where the\r\nsaid Palmer congratulates himself on _the satisfaction which he gave to\r\nFyzoola Khân_ in the conduct of this negotiation, as he spent a month in\r\norder to effect \"by argument and persuasion _what he could have obtained\r\nin an hour by threats and compulsions_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IX.\r\n\r\nFULL VINDICATION OF FYZOOLA KHÂN BY MAJOR PALMER AND MR. HASTINGS.\r\n\r\nI. That, in the course of the said negotiation for establishing the\r\nrights of the Nabob Fyzoola Khân, Major Palmer aforesaid did communicate\r\nto the Resident, Bristow, and through the said Resident to the\r\nCouncil-General of Bengal, the full and direct denial of the Nabob\r\nFyzoola Khân to all and every of the charges made or pretended to be\r\nmade against him, as follows.\r\n\r\n\"Fyzoola Khân persists in denying the infringement on his part of any\r\none article in the treaty, or the neglect of any obligation which it\r\nimposed upon him.\r\n\r\n\"He does not admit of _the improvements reported to be made_ in his\r\njaghire, and even asserts that the collections this year will fall short\r\nof the original _jumma_ [or estimate] by reason of the long drought.\r\n\r\n\"He denies having exceeded the limited number of Rohillas in his\r\nservice;\r\n\r\n\"And having refused the required aid of cavalry, made by Johnson, to act\r\nwith General Goddard.\r\n\r\n\"He observes, respecting the charge of evading the Vizier's requisition\r\nfor the cavalry lately stationed at Daranagur, to be stationed at\r\nLucknow, that he is not bound by treaty to maintain a stationary force\r\nfor the service of the Vizier, but to supply an aid of two or three\r\nthousand troops in time of war.\r\n\r\n\"Lastly, he asserts, that, so far from encouraging the ryots [or\r\npeasants] of the Vizier to settle in his jaghire, it has been his\r\nconstant practice to deliver them up to the Aumil of Rohilcund, whenever\r\nhe could discover them.\"\r\n\r\nII. That, in giving his opinions on the aforesaid denials of the Nabob\r\nFyzoola Khân, the said Palmer did not controvert any one of the\r\nconstructions of the treaty advanced by the said Nabob.\r\n\r\nThat, although the said Palmer, \"from general appearances as well as\r\nuniversal report, did not doubt that the jumma of the jaghire is\r\n_greatly increased_,\" yet he, the said Palmer, did not intimate that it\r\nwas increased in any degree near _the amount reported_, as it was drawn\r\nout in a regular estimate transmitted to the said Palmer expressly for\r\nthe purposes of his negotiation, which was of course by him produced to\r\nthe Nabob Fyzoola Khân, and to which specifically the denial of Fyzoola\r\nKhân must be understood to apply.\r\n\r\nThat the said Palmer did not hint any doubt of the deficiency affirmed\r\nby Fyzoola Khân in the collections for the current year: and,\r\n\r\nThat, if any increase of jumma did truly exist, whatever it may have\r\nbeen, the said Palmer did acknowledge it \"to have been solemnly\r\nrelinquished (in a private agreement) by the Vizier.\"\r\n\r\nThat, although the said Palmer did suppose the number of Rohillas\r\n(employed \"in ordinary occupations) in Rampoor alone to exceed that\r\nlimited by the treaty for his [Fyzoola Khân's] service,\" yet the said\r\nPalmer did by no means imply that the Nabob Fyzoola Khân _maintained in\r\nhis service_ a single man more than was allowed by treaty; and by a\r\nparticular and minute account of the troops of Fyzoola Khân, transmitted\r\nby the Resident, Bristow, to the said Palmer, the number was stated but\r\nat 5,840, probably including officers, who were not understood to be\r\ncomprehended in the treaty.\r\n\r\nThat the said Palmer did further admit it \"_to be not clearly expressed_\r\nin the treaty, whether the restriction included Rohillas of all\r\ndescriptions\"; but, at any rate, he adds, \"it does not appear that their\r\nnumber is formidable, or that he [Fyzoola Khân] _could by any means\r\nsubsist such numbers as could cause any serious alarm to the Vizier_;\r\nneither is there any appearance of their entertaining any views beyond\r\nthe quiet possession of the advantages which they at present enjoy.\"\r\n\r\nAnd that, in a subsequent letter, in which the said Palmer thought it\r\nprudent \"to vindicate himself from any possible insinuation that he\r\nmeant to sacrifice the Vizier's interest,\" he, the said Palmer, did\r\npositively attest the new claim on Fyzoola Khân for the protection of\r\nthe Vizier's ryots to be wholly without foundation, as the Nabob Fyzoola\r\nKhân \"had proved to him [Palmer], by producing receipts of various dates\r\nand for great numbers of these people surrendered upon requisition from\r\nthe Vizier's officers.\"\r\n\r\nIII. That, over and above the aforesaid complete refutation of the\r\ndifferent charges and pretexts under which exactions had been practised,\r\nor attempted to be practised, on the Nabob Fyzoola Khân, the said Palmer\r\ndid further condemn altogether the principle of calculation assumed in\r\nsuch exactions (even if they had been founded in justice) by the\r\nfollowing explanation of the nature of the tenure by which, under the\r\ntreaty of Lall-Dang, the Nabob Fyzoola Khân held his possessions as a\r\njaghiredar.\r\n\r\n\"There are no precedents in the ancient usage of the country for\r\nascertaining the _nuzzerana_ [customary present] or _peshcush_ [regular\r\nfine] of grants of this nature: _they were bestowed by the prince as\r\nrewards or favors_; and the accustomary present in return was adapted to\r\nthe dignity of the donor rather than to the value of the gift,--_to\r\nwhich it never, I believe, bore any kind of proportion_.\"\r\n\r\nIV. That a sum of money (\"which of course was to be received by the\r\nCompany\") being now obtained, and the \"_interests both of the Company\r\nand the Vizier_\" being thus much \"_better promoted_\" by \"_establishing\r\nthe rights_\" of Fyzoola Khân than they could have been by \"_depriving\r\nhim of his independency_,\" when every undue influence of secret and\r\ncriminal purposes was removed from the mind of the Governor-General,\r\nWarren Hastings, Esquire, he, the said Hastings, did also concur with\r\nhis friend and agent, Major Palmer, in the vindication of the Nabob\r\nFyzoola Khân, and in the most ample manner.\r\n\r\nThat the said Warren Hastings did now clearly and explicitly understand\r\nthe clauses of the treaty, \"that Fyzoola Khân should send _two_ or\r\n_three_ [and not _five_] thousand men, or _attend in person, in case it\r\nwas requisite_.\"\r\n\r\nThat the said Warren Hastings did now confess that the right of the\r\nVizier under the treaty was at best \"but _a precarious and unserviceable\r\nright_; and that he thought fifteen lacs, or 150,000_l._ and upwards, an\r\nample equivalent,\" (or, according to the expression of Major Palmer, _an\r\nexcellent bargain_,) as in truth it was, \"for expunging an article of\r\nsuch a tenor and so loosely worded.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, finally, that the said Hastings did give the following description\r\nof the general character, disposition, and circumstances of the Nabob\r\nFyzoola Khân.\r\n\r\n\"The rumors which had been spread of his hostile designs against the\r\nVizier were totally groundless, and if he had been inclined, he had not\r\nthe means to make himself formidable; on the contrary, being in the\r\ndecline of life, and possessing a very fertile and prosperous jaghire,\r\nit is more natural to suppose that Fyzoola Khân wishes to spend the\r\nremainder of his days in quietness than that he is preparing to embark\r\nin active and offensive scenes which must end in his own destruction.\"\r\n\r\nV. Yet that, notwithstanding this virtual and implied crimination of his\r\nwhole conduct toward the Nabob Fyzoola Khân, and after all the aforesaid\r\nacts systematically prosecuted in open violation of a positive treaty\r\nagainst a prince who had an hereditary right to more than he actually\r\npossessed, for whose protection the faith of the Company and the nation\r\nwas repeatedly pledged, and who had deserved and obtained the public\r\nthanks of the British government,--when, in allusion to certain of the\r\nsaid acts, the Court of Directors had expressed to the said Hastings\r\ntheir wishes \"to be considered rather as the guardians of the honor and\r\nproperty of the native powers than as the instruments of oppression,\"\r\nhe, the said Hastings, in reply to the said Directors, his masters, did\r\nconclude his official account of the final settlement with Fyzoola Khân\r\nwith the following indecent, because unjust, exultation:--\r\n\r\n\"Such are the measures which we shall ever wish to observe towards our\r\nallies or dependants upon our frontiers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\nTO THE\r\n\r\nEIGHTH AND SIXTEENTH CHARGES.[26]\r\n\r\n\r\n    Copy of a Letter from Warren Hastings, Esquire, to William Devaynes,\r\n    Esquire, Chairman of the Court of Directors of the East India\r\n    Company, dated Cheltenham, 11th of July, 1785, and printed by order\r\n    of the House of Commons.\r\n\r\n_To William Devaynes, Esquire, Chairman of the Honorable the Court of\r\nDirectors._\r\n\r\nSir,--The Honorable Court of Directors, in their general letter to\r\nBengal by the \"Surprise,\" dated the 16th March, 1784, were pleased to\r\nexpress their desire that I should inform them of the periods when each\r\nsum of the presents mentioned in my address of the 22d May, 1782, was\r\nreceived, what were my motives for withholding the several receipts from\r\nthe knowledge of the Council, or of the Court of Directors, and what\r\nwere my reasons for taking bonds for part of these sums, and for paying\r\nother sums into the treasury as deposits on my own account.\r\n\r\nI have been kindly apprised that the information required as above is\r\nyet expected from me. I hope that the circumstances of my past\r\nsituation, when considered, will plead my excuse for having thus long\r\nwithheld it. The fact is, that I was not at the Presidency when the\r\n\"Surprise\" arrived; and when I returned to it, my time and attention\r\nwere so entirely engrossed, to the day of my final departure from it, by\r\na variety of other more important occupations, of which, Sir, I may\r\nsafely appeal to your testimony, grounded on the large portion\r\ncontributed by myself of the volumes which compose our Consultations of\r\nthat period, that the submission which my respect would have enjoined me\r\nto pay to the command imposed on me was lost to my recollection, perhaps\r\nfrom the stronger impression which the first and distant perusal of it\r\nhad left on my mind that it was rather intended as a reprehension for\r\nsomething which had given offence in my report of the original\r\ntransaction than as expressive of any want of a further elucidation of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nI will now endeavor to reply to the different questions which have been\r\nstated to me in as explicit a manner as I am able. To such information\r\nas I can give the Honorable Court is fully entitled; and where that\r\nshall prove defective, I will point out the easy means by which it may\r\nbe rendered more complete.\r\n\r\nFirst, I believe I can affirm with certainty, that the several sums\r\nmentioned in the account transmitted with my letter above mentioned were\r\nreceived at or within a very few days of the dates which are prefixed to\r\nthem in the account; but as this contains only the gross sums, and each\r\nof these was received in different payments, though at no great distance\r\nof time, I cannot therefore assign a greater degree of accuracy to the\r\naccount. Perhaps the Honorable Court will judge this sufficient for any\r\npurpose to which their inquiry was directed; but if it should not be so,\r\nI will beg leave to refer for a more minute information, and for the\r\nmeans of making any investigation which they may think it proper to\r\ndirect, respecting the particulars of this transaction, to Mr. Larkins,\r\nyour Accountant-General, who was privy to every process of it, and\r\npossesses, as I believe, the original paper, which contained the only\r\naccount that I ever kept of it. In this each receipt was, as I\r\nrecollect, specifically inserted, with the name of the person by whom it\r\nwas made; and I shall write to him to desire that he will furnish you\r\nwith the paper itself, if it is still in being and in his hands, or with\r\nwhatever he can distinctly recollect concerning it.\r\n\r\nFor my motives for withholding the several receipts from the knowledge\r\nof the Council, or of the Court of Directors, and for taking bonds for\r\npart of these sums, and paying others into the treasury as deposits on\r\nmy own account, I have generally accounted in my letter to the Honorable\r\nthe Court of Directors of the 22d May, 1782: namely, that \"I either\r\nchose to conceal the first receipts from public curiosity by receiving\r\nbonds for the amount, or possibly acted without any studied design which\r\nmy memory at that distance of time could verify; and that I did not\r\nthink it worth my care to observe the same means with the rest.\" It will\r\nnot be expected that I should be able to give a more correct explanation\r\nof my intentions after a lapse of three years, having declared at the\r\ntime that many particulars had escaped my remembrance; neither shall I\r\nattempt to add more than the clearer affirmation of the facts implied in\r\nthat report of them, and such inferences as necessarily, or with a\r\nstrong probability, follow them.\r\n\r\nI have said that the three first sums of the account were paid into the\r\nCompany's treasury without passing through my hands. The second of these\r\nwas forced into notice by its destination and application to the expense\r\nof a detachment which was formed and employed against Mahdajee Sindia\r\nunder the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Camac, as I particularly\r\napprised the Court of Directors in my letter of the 29th November, 1780.\r\nThe other two were certainly not intended, when I received them, to be\r\nmade public, though intended for public service, and actually applied to\r\nit. The exigencies of the government were at that time my own, and every\r\npressure upon it rested with its full weight upon my mind. Wherever I\r\ncould find allowable means of relieving those wants, I eagerly seized\r\nthem; but neither could it occur to me as necessary to state on our\r\nProceedings every little aid which I could thus procure, nor do I know\r\nhow I could have stated it, without appearing to court favor by an\r\nostentation which I disdain, nor without the chance of exciting the\r\njealousy of my colleagues by the constructive assertion of a separate\r\nand unparticipated merit, derived from the influence of my station, to\r\nwhich they might have laid an equal claim. I should have deemed it\r\nparticularly dishonorable to receive for my own use money tendered by\r\nmen of a certain class, from whom I had interdicted the receipt of\r\npresents to my inferiors, and bound them by oath not to receive them. I\r\nwas therefore more than ordinarily cautious to avoid the suspicion of\r\nit, which would scarcely have failed to light upon me, had I suffered\r\nthe money to be brought directly to my own house, or to that of any\r\nperson known to be in trust for me: for these reasons I caused it to be\r\ntransported immediately to the treasury. There, you well know, Sir, it\r\ncould not be received without being passed to some credit, and this\r\ncould only be done by entering it as a loan or as a deposit: the first\r\nwas the least liable to reflection, and therefore I had obviously\r\nrecourse to it. Why the second sum was entered as a deposit I am utterly\r\nignorant: possibly it was done without any special direction from me;\r\npossibly because it was the simplest mode of entry, and therefore\r\npreferred, as the transaction itself did not require concealment, having\r\nbeen already avowed.\r\n\r\nAlthough I am firmly persuaded that these were my sentiments on the\r\noccasion, yet I will not affirm that they were. Though I feel their\r\nimpression as the remains of a series of thoughts retained on my memory,\r\nI am not certain that they may not have been produced by subsequent\r\nreflection on the principal fact, combining with it the probable motives\r\nof it. Of this I am certain, that it was my design originally to have\r\nconcealed the receipt of all the sums, except the second, even from the\r\nknowledge of the Court of Directors. They had answered my purpose of\r\npublic utility, and I had almost totally dismissed them from my\r\nremembrance. But when fortune threw a sum in my way of a magnitude which\r\ncould not be concealed, and the peculiar delicacy of my situation at the\r\ntime in which I received it made me more circumspect of appearances, I\r\nchose to apprise my employers of it, which I did hastily and generally:\r\nhastily, perhaps to prevent the vigilance and activity of secret\r\ncalumny; and generally, because I knew not the exact amount of the sum,\r\nof which I was in the receipt, but not in the full possession. I\r\npromised to acquaint them with the result as soon as I should be in\r\npossession of it, and in the performance of my promise I thought it\r\nconsistent with it to add to the account all the former appropriations\r\nof the same kind: my good genius then suggesting to me, with a spirit of\r\ncaution which might have spared me the trouble of this apology, had I\r\nuniversally attended to it, that, if I had suppressed them, and they\r\nwere afterwards known, I might be asked what were my motives for\r\nwithholding part of these receipts from the knowledge of the Court of\r\nDirectors and informing them of the rest.\r\n\r\nIt being my wish to clear up every doubt upon this transaction, which\r\neither my own mind could suggest or which may have been suggested by\r\nothers, I beg leave to suppose another question, and to state the terms\r\nof it in my reply, by informing you that the indorsement on the bonds\r\nwas made about the period of my leaving the Presidency, in the middle of\r\nthe year 1781, in order to guard against their becoming a claim on the\r\nCompany, as part of my estate, in the event of my death occurring in the\r\ncourse of the service on which I was then entering.\r\n\r\nThis, Sir, is the plain history of the transaction. I should be ashamed\r\nto request that you would communicate it to the Honorable Court of\r\nDirectors, whose time is too valuable for the intrusion of a subject so\r\nuninteresting, but that it is become a point of indispensable duty; I\r\nmust therefore request the favor of you to lay it, at a convenient time,\r\nbefore them. In addressing it to you personally, I yield to my own\r\nfeelings of the respect which is due to them as a body, and to the\r\nassurances which I derive from your experienced civilities that you will\r\nkindly overlook the trouble imposed by it.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\r\n  Your very humble and most obedient servant,\r\n     (Signed)                 WARREN HASTINGS.\r\n\r\n  CHELTENHAM, 11 July, 1785.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECHES\r\n\r\nIN\r\n\r\nTHE IMPEACHMENT\r\n\r\nOF\r\n\r\nWARREN HASTINGS, ESQUIRE,\r\n\r\nLATE GOVERNOR-GENERAL OF BENGAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH IN OPENING.\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY, 1788.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH\r\n\r\nIN\r\n\r\nOPENING THE IMPEACHMENT.\r\n\r\nFIRST DAY: FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 15, 1788.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Lords,--The gentlemen who have it in command to support the\r\nimpeachment against Mr. Hastings have directed me to open the cause with\r\na general view of the grounds upon which the Commons have proceeded in\r\ntheir charge against him. They have directed me to accompany this with\r\nanother general view of the extent, the magnitude, the nature, the\r\ntendency, and the effect of the crimes which they allege to have been by\r\nhim committed. They have also directed me to give an explanation (with\r\ntheir aid I may be enabled to give it) of such circumstances, preceding\r\nthe crimes charged on Mr. Hastings, or concomitant with them, as may\r\ntend to elucidate whatever may be found obscure in the articles as they\r\nstand. To these they wished me to add a few illustrative remarks on the\r\nlaws, customs, opinions, and manners of the people concerned, and who\r\nare the objects of the crimes we charge on Mr. Hastings. The several\r\narticles, as they appear before you, will be opened by other gentlemen\r\nwith more particularity, with more distinctness, and, without doubt,\r\nwith infinitely more ability, when they come to apply the evidence which\r\nnaturally belongs to each article of this accusation. This, my Lords, is\r\nthe plan which we mean to pursue on the great charge which is now to\r\nabide your judgment.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, I must look upon it as an auspicious circumstance to this\r\ncause, in which the honor of the kingdom and the fate of many nations\r\nare involved, that, from the first commencement of our Parliamentary\r\nprocess to this the hour of solemn trial, not the smallest difference of\r\nopinion has arisen between the two Houses.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, there are persons who, looking rather upon what was to be\r\nfound in our records and histories than what was to be expected from the\r\npublic justice, had formed hopes consolatory to themselves and\r\ndishonorable to us. They flattered themselves that the corruptions of\r\nIndia would escape amidst the dissensions of Parliament. They are\r\ndisappointed. They will be disappointed in all the rest of their\r\nexpectations which they have formed upon everything, except the merits\r\nof their cause. The Commons will not have the melancholy unsocial glory\r\nof having acted a solitary part in a noble, but imperfect work. What the\r\ngreatest inquest of the nation has begun its highest tribunal will\r\naccomplish. At length justice will be done to India. It is true that\r\nyour Lordships will have your full share in this great achievement; but\r\nthe Commons have always considered that whatever honor is divided with\r\nyou is doubled on themselves.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, I must confess, that, amidst these encouraging prospects, the\r\nCommons do not approach your bar without awe and anxiety. The magnitude\r\nof the interests which we have in charge will reconcile some degree of\r\nsolicitude for the event with the undoubting confidence with which we\r\nrepose ourselves upon your Lordships' justice. For we are men, my\r\nLords; and men are so made, that it is not only the greatness of danger,\r\nbut the value of the adventure, which measures the degree of our concern\r\nin every undertaking. I solemnly assure your Lordships that no standard\r\nis sufficient to estimate the value which the Commons set upon the event\r\nof the cause they now bring before you. My Lords, the business of this\r\nday is not the business of this man, it is not solely whether the\r\nprisoner at the bar be found innocent or guilty, but whether millions of\r\nmankind shall be made miserable or happy.\r\n\r\nYour Lordships will see, in the progress of this cause, that there is\r\nnot only a long, connected, systematic series of misdemeanors, but an\r\nequally connected system of maxims and principles invented to justify\r\nthem. Upon both of these you must judge. According to the judgment that\r\nyou shall give upon the past transactions in India, inseparably\r\nconnected as they are with the principles which support them, the whole\r\ncharacter of your future government in that distant empire is to be\r\nunalterably decided. It will take its perpetual tenor, it will receive\r\nits final impression, from the stamp of this very hour.\r\n\r\nIt is not only the interest of India, now the most considerable part of\r\nthe British empire, which is concerned, but the credit and honor of the\r\nBritish nation itself will be decided by this decision. We are to decide\r\nby this judgment, whether the crimes of individuals are to be turned\r\ninto public guilt and national ignominy, or whether this nation will\r\nconvert the very offences which have thrown a transient shade upon its\r\ngovernment into something that will reflect a permanent lustre upon the\r\nhonor, justice, and humanity of this kingdom.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, there is another consideration, which augments the solicitude\r\nof the Commons, equal to those other two great interests I have stated,\r\nthose of our empire and our national character,--something that, if\r\npossible, comes more home to the hearts and feelings of every\r\nEnglishman: I mean, the interests of our Constitution itself, which is\r\ndeeply involved in the event of this cause. The future use and the whole\r\neffect, if not the very existence, of the process of an impeachment of\r\nhigh crimes and misdemeanors before the peers of this kingdom upon the\r\ncharge of the Commons will very much be decided by your judgment in this\r\ncause. This tribunal will be found (I hope it will always be found) too\r\ngreat for petty causes: if it should at the same time be found\r\nincompetent to one of the greatest,--that is, if little offences, from\r\ntheir minuteness, escape you, and the greatest, from their magnitude,\r\noppress you,--it is impossible that this form of trial should not in the\r\nend vanish out of the Constitution. For we must not deceive ourselves:\r\nwhatever does not stand with credit cannot stand long. And if the\r\nConstitution should be deprived, I do not mean in form, but virtually,\r\nof this resource, it is virtually deprived of everything else that is\r\nvaluable in it. For this process is the cement which binds the whole\r\ntogether; this is the individuating principle that makes England what\r\nEngland is. In this court it is that no subject, in no part of the\r\nempire, can fail of competent and proportionable justice; here it is\r\nthat we provide for that which is the substantial excellence of our\r\nConstitution,--I mean, the great circulation of responsibility, by which\r\n(excepting the supreme power) no man, in no circumstance, can escape\r\nthe account which he owes to the laws of his country. It is by this\r\nprocess that magistracy, which tries and controls all other things, is\r\nitself tried and controlled. Other constitutions are satisfied with\r\nmaking good subjects; this is a security for good governors. It is by\r\nthis tribunal that statesmen who abuse their power are accused by\r\nstatesmen and tried by statesmen, not upon the niceties of a narrow\r\njurisprudence, but upon the enlarged and solid principles of state\r\nmorality. It is here that those who by the abuse of power have violated\r\nthe spirit of law can never hope for protection from any of its forms;\r\nit is here that those who have refused to conform themselves to its\r\nperfections can never hope to escape through any of its defects. It\r\nought, therefore, my Lords, to become our common care to guard this your\r\nprecious deposit, rare in its use, but powerful in its effect, with a\r\nreligious vigilance, and never to suffer it to be either discredited or\r\nantiquated. For this great end your Lordships are invested with great\r\nand plenary powers: but you do not suspend, you do not supersede, you do\r\nnot annihilate any subordinate jurisdiction; on the contrary, you are\r\nauxiliary and supplemental to them all.\r\n\r\nWhether it is owing to the felicity of our times, less fertile in great\r\noffences than those which have gone before us, or whether it is from a\r\nsluggish apathy which has dulled and enervated the public justice, I am\r\nnot called upon to determine,--but, whatever may be the cause, it is now\r\nsixty-three years since any impeachment, grounded upon abuse of\r\nauthority and misdemeanor in office, has come before this tribunal. The\r\nlast is that of Lord Macclesfield, which happened in the year 1725. So\r\nthat the oldest process known to the Constitution of this country has,\r\nupon its revival, some appearance of novelty. At this time, when all\r\nEurope is in a state of, perhaps, contagious fermentation, when\r\nantiquity has lost all its reverence and all its effect on the minds of\r\nmen, at the same time that novelty is still attended with the suspicions\r\nthat always will be attached to whatever is new, we have been anxiously\r\ncareful, in a business which seems to combine the objections both to\r\nwhat is antiquated and what is novel, so to conduct ourselves that\r\nnothing in the revival of this great Parliamentary process shall afford\r\na pretext for its future disuse.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, strongly impressed as they are with these sentiments, the\r\nCommons have conducted themselves with singular care and caution.\r\nWithout losing the spirit and zeal of a public prosecution, they have\r\ncomported themselves with such moderation, temper, and decorum as would\r\nnot have ill become the final judgment, if with them rested the final\r\njudgment, of this great cause.\r\n\r\nWith very few intermissions, the affairs of India have constantly\r\nengaged the attention of the Commons for more than fourteen years. We\r\nmay safely affirm we have tried every mode of legislative provision\r\nbefore we had recourse to anything of penal process. It was in the year\r\n1774 [1773?] we framed an act of Parliament for remedy to the then\r\nexisting disorders in India, such as the then information before us\r\nenabled us to enact. Finding that the act of Parliament did not answer\r\nall the ends that were expected from it, we had, in the year 1782,\r\nrecourse to a body of monitory resolutions. Neither had we the expected\r\nfruit from them. When, therefore, we found that our inquiries and our\r\nreports, our laws and our admonitions, were alike despised, that\r\nenormities increased in proportion as they were forbidden, detected, and\r\nexposed,--when we found that guilt stalked with an erect and upright\r\nfront, and that legal authority seemed to skulk and hide its head like\r\noutlawed guilt,--when we found that some of those very persons who were\r\nappointed by Parliament to assert the authority of the laws of this\r\nkingdom were the most forward, the most bold, and the most active in the\r\nconspiracy for their destruction,--then it was time for the justice of\r\nthe nation to recollect itself. To have forborne longer would not have\r\nbeen patience, but collusion; it would have been participation with\r\nguilt; it would have been to make ourselves accomplices with the\r\ncriminal.\r\n\r\nWe found it was impossible to evade painful duty without betraying a\r\nsacred trust. Having, therefore, resolved upon the last and only\r\nresource, a penal prosecution, it was our next business to act in a\r\nmanner worthy of our long deliberation. In all points we proceeded with\r\nselection. We have chosen (we trust it will so appear to your Lordships)\r\nsuch a crime, and such a criminal, and such a body of evidence, and such\r\na mode of process, as would have recommended this course of justice to\r\nposterity, even if it had not been supported by any example in the\r\npractice of our forefathers.\r\n\r\nFirst, to speak of the process: we are to inform your Lordships, that,\r\nbesides that long previous deliberation of fourteen years, we examined,\r\nas a preliminary to this proceeding, every circumstance which could\r\nprove favorable to parties apparently delinquent, before we finally\r\nresolved to prosecute. There was no precedent to be found in the\r\nJournals, favorable to persons in Mr. Hastings's circumstances, that was\r\nnot applied to. Many measures utterly unknown to former Parliamentary\r\nproceedings, and which, indeed, seemed in some degree to enfeeble them,\r\nbut which were all to the advantage of those that were to be prosecuted,\r\nwere adopted, for the first time, upon this occasion. In an early stage\r\nof the proceeding, the criminal desired to be heard. He was heard; and\r\nhe produced before the bar of the House that insolent and unbecoming\r\npaper which lies upon our table. It was deliberately given in by his own\r\nhand, and signed with his own name. The Commons, however, passed by\r\neverything offensive in that paper with a magnanimity that became them.\r\nThey considered nothing in it but the facts that the defendant alleged,\r\nand the principles he maintained; and after a deliberation not short of\r\njudicial, we proceeded with confidence to your bar.\r\n\r\nSo far as to the process; which, though I mentioned last in the line and\r\norder in which I stated the objects of our selection, I thought it best\r\nto dispatch first.\r\n\r\nAs to the crime which we chose, we first considered well what it was in\r\nits nature, under all the circumstances which attended it. We weighed it\r\nwith all its extenuations and with all its aggravations. On that review,\r\nwe are warranted to assert that the crimes with which we charge the\r\nprisoner at the bar are substantial crimes,--that they are no errors or\r\nmistakes, such as wise and good men might possibly fall into, which may\r\neven produce very pernicious effects without being in fact great\r\noffences. The Commons are too liberal not to allow for the difficulties\r\nof a great and arduous public situation. They know too well the\r\ndomineering necessities which frequently occur in all great affairs.\r\nThey know the exigency of a pressing occasion, which, in its precipitate\r\ncareer, bears everything down before it,--which does not give time to\r\nthe mind to recollect its faculties, to reinforce its reason, and to\r\nhave recourse to fixed principles, but, by compelling an instant and\r\ntumultuous decision, too often obliges men to decide in a manner that\r\ncalm judgment would certainly have rejected. We know, as we are to be\r\nserved by men, that the persons who serve us must be tried as men, and\r\nwith a very large allowance indeed to human infirmity and human error.\r\nThis, my Lords, we knew and we weighed before we came before you. But\r\nthe crimes which we charge in these articles are not lapses, defects,\r\nerrors of common human frailty, which, as we know and feel, we can allow\r\nfor. We charge this offender with no crimes that have not arisen from\r\npassions which it is criminal to harbor,--with no offences that have not\r\ntheir root in avarice, rapacity, pride, insolence, ferocity, treachery,\r\ncruelty, malignity of temper,--in short, in [with?] nothing that does\r\nnot argue a total extinction of all moral principle, that does not\r\nmanifest an inveterate blackness of heart, dyed in grain with malice,\r\nvitiated, corrupted, gangrened to the very core. If we do not plant his\r\ncrimes in those vices which the breast of man is made to abhor, and the\r\nspirit of all laws, human and divine, to interdict, we desire no longer\r\nto be heard upon this occasion. Let everything that can be pleaded on\r\nthe ground of surprise or error, upon those grounds be pleaded with\r\nsuccess: we give up the whole of those predicaments. We urge no crimes\r\nthat were not crimes of forethought. We charge him with nothing that he\r\ndid not commit upon deliberation,--that he did not commit against\r\nadvice, supplication, and remonstrance,--that he did not commit against\r\nthe direct command of lawful authority,--that he did not commit after\r\nreproof and reprimand, the reproof and reprimand of those who were\r\nauthorized by the laws to reprove and reprimand him. The crimes of Mr.\r\nHastings are crimes not only in themselves, but aggravated by being\r\ncrimes of contumacy. They were crimes, not against forms, but against\r\nthose eternal laws of justice which are our rule and our birthright. His\r\noffences are, not in formal, technical language, but in reality, in\r\nsubstance and effect, _high_ crimes and high misdemeanors.\r\n\r\nSo far as to the crimes. As to the criminal, we have chosen him on the\r\nsame principle on which we selected the crimes. We have not chosen to\r\nbring before you a poor, puny, trembling delinquent, misled, perhaps, by\r\nthose who ought to have taught him better, but who have afterwards\r\noppressed him by their power, as they had first corrupted him by their\r\nexample. Instances there have been many, wherein the punishment of minor\r\noffences, in inferior persons, has been made the means of screening\r\ncrimes of an high order, and in men of high description. Our course is\r\ndifferent. We have not brought before you an obscure offender, who, when\r\nhis insignificance and weakness are weighed against the power of the\r\nprosecution, gives even to public justice something of the appearance of\r\noppression: no, my Lords, we have brought before you the first man of\r\nIndia, in rank, authority, and station. We have brought before you the\r\nchief of the tribe, the head of the whole body of Eastern offenders, a\r\ncaptain-general of iniquity, under whom all the fraud, all the\r\npeculation, all the tyranny in India are embodied, disciplined, arrayed,\r\nand paid. This is the person, my Lords, that we bring before you. We\r\nhave brought before you such a person, that, if you strike at him with\r\nthe firm and decided arm of justice, you will not have need of a great\r\nmany more examples. You strike at the whole corps, if you strike at the\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nSo far as to the crime: so far as to the criminal. Now, my Lords, I\r\nshall say a few words relative to the evidence which we have brought to\r\nsupport such a charge, and which ought to be equal in weight to the\r\ncharge itself. It is chiefly evidence of record, officially signed by\r\nthe criminal himself in many instances. We have brought before you his\r\nown letters, authenticated by his own hand. On these we chiefly rely.\r\nBut we shall likewise bring before you living witnesses, competent to\r\nspeak to the points to which they are brought.\r\n\r\nWhen you consider the late enormous power of the prisoner,--when you\r\nconsider his criminal, indefatigable assiduity in the destruction of all\r\nrecorded evidence,--when you consider the influence he has over almost\r\nall living testimony,--when you consider the distance of the scene of\r\naction,--I believe your Lordships, and I believe the world, will be\r\nastonished that so much, so clear, so solid, and so conclusive evidence\r\nof all kinds has been obtained against him. I have no doubt that in nine\r\ninstances in ten the evidence is such as would satisfy the narrow\r\nprecision supposed to prevail, and to a degree rightly to prevail, in\r\nall subordinate power and delegated jurisdiction. But your Lordships\r\nwill maintain, what we assert and claim as the right of the subjects of\r\nGreat Britain, that you are not bound by any rules of evidence, or any\r\nother rules whatever, except those of natural, immutable, and\r\nsubstantial justice.\r\n\r\nGod forbid the Commons should desire that anything should be received as\r\nproof from them which is not by nature adapted to prove the thing in\r\nquestion! If they should make such a request, they would aim at\r\noverturning the very principles of that justice to which they resort;\r\nthey would give the nation an evil example that would rebound back on\r\nthemselves, and bring destruction upon their own heads, and on those of\r\nall their posterity.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I have too much confidence in the learning with which\r\nyou will be advised, and the liberality and nobleness of the sentiments\r\nwith which you are born, to suspect that you would, by any abuse of the\r\nforms, and a technical course of proceeding, deny justice to so great a\r\npart of the world that claims it at your hands. Your Lordships always\r\nhad an ample power, and almost unlimited jurisdiction; you have now a\r\nboundless object. It is not from this district or from that parish, not\r\nfrom this city or the other province, that relief is now applied for:\r\nexiled and undone princes, extensive tribes, suffering nations, infinite\r\ndescriptions of men, different in language, in manners, and in rites,\r\nmen separated by every barrier of Nature from you, by the Providence of\r\nGod are blended in one common cause, and are now become suppliants at\r\nyour bar. For the honor of this nation, in vindication of this\r\nmysterious Providence, let it be known that no rule formed upon\r\nmunicipal maxims (if any such rule exists) will prevent the course of\r\nthat imperial justice which you owe to the people that call to you from\r\nall parts of a great disjointed world. For, situated as this kingdom is,\r\nan object, thank God, of envy to the rest of the nations, its conduct in\r\nthat high and elevated situation will undoubtedly be scrutinized with a\r\nseverity as great as its power is invidious.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that enormous wealth has poured into this country from\r\nIndia through a thousand channels, public and concealed; and it is no\r\nparticular derogation from our honor to suppose a possibility of being\r\ncorrupted by that by which other empires have been corrupted, and\r\nassemblies almost as respectable and venerable as your Lordships' have\r\nbeen directly or indirectly vitiated. Forty millions of money, at least,\r\nhave within our memory been brought from India into England. In this\r\ncase the most sacred judicature ought to look to its reputation. Without\r\noffence we may venture to suggest that the best way to secure reputation\r\nis, not by a proud defiance of public opinion, but by guiding our\r\nactions in such a manner as that public opinion may in the end be\r\nsecurely defied, by having been previously respected and dreaded. No\r\ndirect false judgment is apprehended from the tribunals of this country;\r\nbut it is feared that partiality may lurk and nestle in the abuse of our\r\nforms of proceeding. It is necessary, therefore, that nothing in that\r\nproceeding should appear to mark the slightest trace, should betray the\r\nfaintest odor of chicane. God forbid, that, when you try the most\r\nserious of all causes, that, when you try the cause of Asia in the\r\npresence of Europe, there should be the least suspicion that a narrow\r\npartiality, utterly destructive of justice, should so guide us that a\r\nBritish subject in power should appear in substance to possess rights\r\nwhich are denied to the humble allies, to the attached dependants of\r\nthis kingdom, who by their distance have a double demand upon your\r\nprotection, and who, by an implicit (I hope not a weak and useless)\r\ntrust in you, have stripped themselves of every other resource under\r\nheaven!\r\n\r\nI do not say this from any fear, doubt, or hesitation concerning what\r\nyour Lordships will finally do,--none in the world; but I cannot shut my\r\nears to the rumors which you all know to be disseminated abroad. The\r\nabusers of power may have a chance to cover themselves by those fences\r\nand intrenchments which were made to secure the liberties of the people\r\nagainst men of that very description. But God forbid it should be\r\nbruited from Pekin to Paris, that the laws of England are for the rich\r\nand the powerful, but to the poor, the miserable, and defenceless they\r\nafford no resource at all! God forbid it should be said, no nation is\r\nequal to the English in _substantial_ violence and in _formal_\r\njustice,--that in this kingdom we feel ourselves competent to confer the\r\nmost extravagant and inordinate powers upon public ministers, but that\r\nwe are deficient, poor, helpless, lame, and impotent in the means of\r\ncalling them to account for their use of them! An opinion has been\r\ninsidiously circulated through this kingdom, and through foreign nations\r\ntoo, that, in order to cover our participation in guilt, and our common\r\ninterest in the plunder of the East, we have invented a set of\r\nscholastic distinctions, abhorrent to the common sense and unpropitious\r\nto the common necessities of mankind, by which we are to deny ourselves\r\nthe knowledge of what the rest of the world knows, and what so great a\r\npart of the world both knows and feels. I do not deprecate any\r\nappearance which may give countenance to this aspersion from suspicion\r\nthat any corrupt motive can influence this court; I deprecate it from\r\nknowing that hitherto we have moved within the narrow circle of\r\nmunicipal justice. I am afraid, that, from the habits acquired by moving\r\nwithin a circumscribed sphere, we may be induced rather to endeavor at\r\nforcing Nature into that municipal circle than to enlarge the circle of\r\nnational justice to the necessities of the empire we have obtained.\r\n\r\nThis is the only thing which does create any doubt or difficulty in the\r\nminds of sober people. But there are those who will not judge so\r\nequitably. Where two motives, neither of them perfectly justifiable, may\r\nbe assigned, the worst has the chance of being preferred. If, from any\r\nappearance of chicane in the court, justice should fail, all men will\r\nsay, better there were no tribunals at all. In my humble opinion, it\r\nwould be better a thousand times to give all complainants the short\r\nanswer the Dey of Algiers gave a British ambassador, representing\r\ncertain grievances suffered by the British merchants,--\"My friend,\" (as\r\nthe story is related by Dr. Shaw,) \"do not you know that my subjects are\r\na band of robbers, and that I am their captain?\"--better it would be a\r\nthousand times, and a thousand thousand times more manly, than an\r\nhypocritical process, which, under a pretended reverence to punctilious\r\nceremonies and observances of law, abandons mankind without help and\r\nresource to all the desolating consequences of arbitrary power. The\r\nconduct and event of this cause will put an end to such doubts,\r\nwherever they may be entertained. Your Lordships will exercise the great\r\nplenary powers with which you are invested in a manner that will do\r\nhonor to the protecting justice of this kingdom, that will completely\r\navenge the great people who are subjected to it. You will not suffer\r\nyour proceedings to be squared by any rules but by their necessities,\r\nand by that law of a common nature which cements them to us and us to\r\nthem. The reports to the contrary have been spread abroad with uncommon\r\nindustry; but they will be speedily refuted by the humanity, simplicity,\r\ndignity, and nobleness of your Lordships' justice.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHaving said all that I am instructed to say concerning the process which\r\nthe House of Commons has used, concerning the crimes which they have\r\nchosen, concerning the criminal upon whom they attach the crimes, and\r\nconcerning the evidence which they mean to produce, I am now to proceed\r\nto open that part of the business which falls to my share. It is rather\r\nan explanation of the circumstances than an enforcement of the crimes.\r\n\r\nYour Lordships of course will be apprised that this cause is not what\r\noccurs every day, in the ordinary round of municipal affairs,--that it\r\nhas a relation to many things, that it touches many points in many\r\nplaces, which are wholly removed from the ordinary beaten orbit of our\r\nEnglish affairs. In other affairs, every allusion immediately meets its\r\npoint of reference; nothing can be started that does not immediately\r\nawaken your attention to something in your own laws and usages which you\r\nmeet with every day in the ordinary transactions of life. But here you\r\nare caught, as it were, into another world; you are to have the way\r\npioneered before you. As the subject is new, it must be explained; as it\r\nis intricate as well as new, that explanation can be only comparatively\r\nshort: and therefore, knowing your Lordships to be possessed, along with\r\nall other judicial virtues, of the first and foundation of them all,\r\njudicial patience, I hope that you will not grudge a few hours to the\r\nexplanation of that which has cost the Commons fourteen years' assiduous\r\napplication to acquire,--that your Lordships will not disdain to grant a\r\nfew hours to what has cost the people of India upwards of thirty years\r\nof their innate, inveterate, hereditary patience to endure.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy Lords, the powers which Mr. Hastings is charged with having abused\r\nare the powers delegated to him by the East India Company. The East\r\nIndia Company itself acts under two very dissimilar sorts of powers,\r\nderived from two sources very remote from each other. The first source\r\nof its power is under charters which the crown of Great Britain was\r\nauthorized by act of Parliament to grant; the other is from several\r\ncharters derived from the Emperor of the Moguls, the person in whose\r\ndominions they were chiefly conversant,--particularly that great charter\r\nby which, in the year 1765, they acquired the high-stewardship of the\r\nkingdoms of Bengal, Bahar, and Orissa. Under those two bodies of\r\ncharters, the East India Company, and all their servants, are authorized\r\nto act.\r\n\r\nAs to those of the first description, it is from the British charters\r\nthat they derive the capacity by which they are considered as a public\r\nbody, or at all capable of any public function. It is from thence they\r\nacquire the capacity to take from any power whatsoever any other\r\ncharter, to acquire any other offices, or to hold any other possessions.\r\nThis, being the root and origin of their power, renders them responsible\r\nto the party from whom all their immediate and consequential powers are\r\nderived. As they have emanated from the supreme power of this kingdom,\r\nthe whole body and the whole train of their servants, the corporate body\r\nas a corporate body, individuals as individuals, are responsible to the\r\nhigh justice of this kingdom. In delegating great power to the East\r\nIndia Company, this kingdom has not released its sovereignty; on the\r\ncontrary, the responsibility of the Company is increased by the\r\ngreatness and sacredness of the powers that have been intrusted to it.\r\nAttempts have been made abroad to circulate a notion that the acts of\r\nthe East India Company and their servants are not cognizable here. I\r\nhope on this occasion your Lordships will show that this nation never\r\ndid give a power without annexing to it a proportionable degree of\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\nAs to their other powers, the Company derives them from the Mogul empire\r\nby various charters from that crown, and from the great magistrates of\r\nthat crown, and particularly by the Mogul charter of 1765, by which they\r\nobtained the _dewanny_, that is, the office of lord high-steward, of the\r\nkingdoms of Bengal, Bahar, and Orissa. By that charter they bound\r\nthemselves (and bound inclusively all their servants) to perform all the\r\nduties belonging to that new office, and to be held by all the ties\r\nbelonging to that new relation. If the Mogul empire had existed in its\r\nvigor, they would have been bound, under that responsibility, to\r\nobserve the laws, rights, usages, and customs of the natives, and to\r\npursue their benefit in all things: for this duty was inherent in the\r\nnature, institution, and purpose of the office which they received. If\r\nthe power of the sovereign from whom they derived these powers should by\r\nany revolution in human affairs be annihilated or suspended, their duty\r\nto the people below them, which was created under the Mogul charter, is\r\nnot annihilated, is not even suspended; and for their responsibility in\r\nthe performance of that duty, they are thrown back upon that country\r\n(thank God, not annihilated) from whence their original power, and all\r\nsubsequent derivative powers, have flowed. When the Company acquired\r\nthat high office in India, an English corporation became an integral\r\npart of the Mogul empire. When Great Britain virtually assented to that\r\ngrant of office, and afterwards took advantage of it, Great Britain\r\nguarantied the performance of all its duties. Great Britain entered into\r\na virtual act of union with that country, by which we bound ourselves as\r\nsecurities to preserve the people in all the rights, laws, and liberties\r\nwhich their natural, original sovereign was bound to support, if he had\r\nbeen in condition to support them. By the disposition of events, the two\r\nduties, flowing from two different sources, are now united in one. The\r\npeople of India, therefore, come in the name of the Commons of Great\r\nBritain, but in their own right, to the bar of this House, before the\r\nsupreme royal justice of this kingdom, from whence originally all the\r\npowers under which they have suffered were derived.\r\n\r\nIt may be a little necessary, when we are stating the powers the Company\r\nhave derived from their charter, and which we state Mr. Hastings to\r\nhave abused, to state in as short and as comprehensive words as I can\r\n(for the matter is large indeed) what the constitution of that Company\r\nis,--I mean chiefly, what it is in reference to its Indian service, the\r\ngreat theatre of the abuse. Your Lordships will naturally conceive that\r\nit is not to inform you, but to revive circumstances in your memory,\r\nthat I enter into this detail.\r\n\r\nYou will therefore recollect, that the East India Company had its origin\r\nabout the latter end of the reign of Elizabeth, a period of projects,\r\nwhen all sorts of commercial adventures, companies, and monopolies were\r\nin fashion. At that time the Company was constituted with extensive\r\npowers for increasing the commerce and the honor of this country;\r\nbecause increasing its commerce, without increasing its honor and\r\nreputation, would have been thought at that time, and will be thought\r\nnow, a bad bargain for the country. The powers of the Company were,\r\nunder that charter, merely commercial. By degrees, as the theatre of\r\noperation was distant, as its intercourse was with many great, some\r\nbarbarous, and all of them armed nations, nations in which not only the\r\nsovereign, but the subjects, were armed, it was found necessary to\r\nenlarge their powers. The first power they obtained was a power of naval\r\ndiscipline in their ships,--a power which has been since dropped; the\r\nnext was a power of law martial; the next was a power of civil, and, to\r\na degree, of criminal jurisdiction, within their own factories, upon\r\ntheir own people and their own servants; the next was (and here was a\r\nstride indeed) the power of peace and war. Those high and almost\r\nincommunicable prerogatives of sovereignty, which were hardly ever\r\nknown before to be parted with to any subjects, and which in several\r\nstates were not wholly intrusted to the prince or head of the\r\ncommonwealth himself, were given to the East India Company. That Company\r\nacquired these powers about the end of the reign of Charles the Second;\r\nand they were afterwards more fully, as well as more legally, given by\r\nParliament after the Revolution. From this time, the East India Company\r\nwas no longer merely a mercantile company, formed for the extension of\r\nthe British commerce: it more nearly resembled a delegation of the whole\r\npower and sovereignty of this kingdom sent into the East. From that time\r\nthe Company ought to be considered as a subordinate sovereign power:\r\nthat is, sovereign with regard to the objects which it touched;\r\nsubordinate with regard to the power from whence its great trust was\r\nderived.\r\n\r\nUnder these successive arrangements things took a course very different\r\nfrom their usual order. A new disposition took place, not dreamt of in\r\nthe theories of speculative politicians, and of which few examples in\r\nthe least resembling it have been seen in the modern world, none at all\r\nin the ancient. In other instances, a political body that acts as a\r\ncommonwealth was first settled, and trade followed as a consequence of\r\nthe protection obtained by political power; but here the course of\r\naffairs was reversed. The constitution of the Company began in commerce\r\nand ended in empire. Indeed, wherever the sovereign powers of peace and\r\nwar are given, there wants but time and circumstance to make these\r\npowers supersede every other. The affairs of commerce will fall at last\r\ninto their proper rank and situation. However primary in their original\r\nintention, they will become secondary. The possession, therefore, and\r\nthe power of assertion of these great authorities coinciding with the\r\nimproved state of Europe, with the improved state of arts in Europe,\r\nwith the improved state of laws, and, what is much more material, the\r\nimproved state of military discipline, more and more perfected every day\r\nwith us,--universal improvement in Europe coinciding with the general\r\ndecay of Asia, (for the proud day of Asia is passed,) this improvement\r\ncoinciding with the relaxation and dissolution of the Mogul government,\r\nwith the decline of its warlike spirit, with the total disuse of the\r\nancient strictness of the military discipline established by Tamerlane,\r\nthe India Company came to be what it is, a great empire, carrying on,\r\nsubordinately, a great commerce; it became that thing which was supposed\r\nby the Roman law irreconcilable to reason and propriety,--_eundem\r\nnegotiatorem et dominum_: the same power became the general trader, the\r\nsame power became the supreme lord.\r\n\r\nIn this exalted situation, the India Company, however, still preserves\r\ntraces of its original mercantile character. The whole exterior order of\r\nits political service is carried on upon a mercantile plan and\r\nmercantile principles. In fact, the East India Company in Asia is a\r\nstate in the disguise of a merchant. Its whole service is a system of\r\npublic offices in the disguise of a counting-house. Accordingly, the\r\nwhole external order and series of the service, as I observed, is\r\ncommercial; the principal, the inward, the real, is almost entirely\r\npolitical.\r\n\r\nThis system of the Company's service, its order and discipline, is\r\nnecessary to be explained to your Lordships, that you may see in what\r\nmanner the abuses have affected it. In the first place, all the persons\r\nwho go abroad in the Company's civil service enter as clerks in the\r\ncounting-house, and are called by a name to correspond to\r\nit,--_writers_. In that condition they are obliged to serve five years.\r\nThe second step is that of a _factor_, in which they are obliged to\r\nserve three years. The third step they take is that of a _junior\r\nmerchant_, in which they are obliged to serve three years more. At that\r\nperiod they become _senior merchants_, which is the highest stage of\r\nadvance in the Company's service,--a rank by which they had pretensions,\r\nbefore the year 1774, to the Council, to the succession of the\r\nPresidency, and to whatever other honors the Company has to bestow.\r\n\r\nThe Company had, in its early times, established factories in certain\r\nplaces; which factories by degrees grew to the name of Presidencies and\r\nCouncil, in proportion as the power and influence of the Company\r\nincreased, and as the political began first to struggle with, and at\r\nlength to predominate over, the mercantile. In this form it continued\r\ntill the year 1773, when the legislature broke in, for proper reasons\r\nurging them to it, upon that order of the service, and appointed to the\r\nsuperior department persons who had no title to that place under the\r\nordinary usage of the service. Mr. Hastings and Mr. Harwell, whatever\r\nother titles they might have had, held solely under the act of\r\nParliament nominating them to that authority; but in all other respects,\r\nexcept where the act and other subsequent acts have not broken in upon\r\nit, the whole course of the service remains upon the ancient footing,\r\nthat is, the commercial footing, as to the gradation and order of\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nYour Lordships see here a regular series of gradation, which requires\r\neleven years before any persons can arrive at the highest trusts and\r\nsituations. You will therefore be astonished, when so long a\r\nprobationary service was required, that effects very different from\r\nthose to be expected from long probation have happened, and that in a\r\nmuch shorter time than those eleven years you have seen persons\r\nreturning into this kingdom with affluent, with overbearing fortunes. It\r\nwill be a great part of your inquiry, when we come before your Lordships\r\nto substantiate evidence against Mr. Hastings, to discover how that\r\norder came to be so completely broken down and erased that scarce a\r\ntrace of it for any good purpose remains. Though I will not deny that\r\nthat order, or that any order in a state, may be superseded by the\r\nruling power, when great talents, upon pressing exigencies, are to be\r\ncalled forth, yet I must say the order itself was formed upon wise\r\nprinciples. It furnished the persons who were put in that course of\r\nprobation with an opportunity (if circumstances enabled them) of\r\nacquiring experience in business of revenue, trade, and policy. It gave\r\nto those who watched them a constant inspection of their conduct through\r\nall their progress. On the expectants of office it imposed the necessity\r\nof acquiring a character in proportion to their standing, in order that\r\nall which they had gained by the good behavior of years should not be\r\nlost by the misconduct of an hour. It was a great substantial\r\nregulation. But scarce a trace of the true spirit of it remains to be\r\ndiscovered in Mr. Hastings's government; for Mr. Hastings established\r\noffices, nay, whole systems of offices, and especially a system of\r\noffices in 1781, which being altogether new, none of the rules of\r\ngradation applied to them; and he filled those offices in such a manner\r\nas suited best, not the constitution nor the spirit of the service, but\r\nhis own particular views and purposes. The consequence has been, that\r\npersons in the most immature stages of life have been appointed to\r\nconduct affairs which required the greatest maturity of judgment, the\r\ngreatest possible temper and moderation. Effects naturally consequent\r\nhave followed upon it.--I shall not trouble your Lordships with any\r\nfurther observations on this system of gradation.\r\n\r\nI must, however, remark, before I go further, that there is something in\r\nthe representation of the East India Company in their Oriental territory\r\ndifferent from that, perhaps, of any other nation that has ever\r\ntransported any part of its power from one country to another. The East\r\nIndia Company in India is not properly a branch of the British nation:\r\nit is only a deputation of individuals. When the Tartars entered into\r\nChina, when the Arabs and Tartars successively entered into Hindostan,\r\nwhen the Goths and Vandals penetrated into Europe, when the Normans\r\nforced their way into England, indeed, in all conquests, migrations,\r\nsettlements, and colonizations, the new people came as the offset of a\r\nnation. The Company in India does not exist as a national colony. In\r\neffect and substance nobody can go thither that does not go in its\r\nservice. The English in India are nothing but a seminary for the\r\nsuccession of officers. They are a nation of placemen; they are a\r\ncommonwealth without a people; they are a state made up wholly of\r\nmagistrates. There is nothing to be in propriety called people, to\r\nwatch, to inspect, to balance against the power of office. The power of\r\noffice, so far as the English nation is concerned, is the sole power in\r\nthe country: the consequence of which is, that, being a kingdom of\r\nmagistrates, what is commonly called the _esprit du corps_ is strong in\r\nit. This spirit of the body predominates equally in all its parts; by\r\nwhich the members must consider themselves as having a common interest,\r\nand that common interest separated both from that of the country which\r\nsent them out and from that of the country in which they act. No control\r\nupon them exists,--none, I mean, in persons who understand their\r\nlanguage, who understand their manners, or can apply their conduct to\r\nthe laws. Therefore, in a body so constituted, confederacy is easy, and\r\nhas been general. Your Lordships are not to expect that that should\r\nhappen in such a body which never happened in any body or\r\ncorporation,--that is, that they should, in any instance, be a proper\r\ncheck and control upon themselves. It is not in the nature of things.\r\nThe fundamental principle of the whole of the East India Company's\r\nsystem is monopoly, in some sense or other. The same principle\r\npredominates in the service abroad and the service at home; and both\r\nsystems are united into one, animated with the same spirit, that is,\r\nwith the corporate spirit. The whole, taken together, is such as has not\r\nbeen seen in the examples of the Moors, the Portuguese, the Spaniards,\r\nthe Romans,--in no old, in no recent examples. The Dutch may resemble\r\nit, but they have not an empire properly so denominated. By means of\r\nthis peculiar circumstance it has not been difficult for Mr. Hastings to\r\nembody abuse, and to put himself at the head of a regular system of\r\ncorruption.\r\n\r\nAnother circumstance in that service is deserving of notice. Except in\r\nthe highest parts of all, the emoluments of office do not in any degree\r\ncorrespond with the trust, nor the nature of the office with its name.\r\nIn other official systems, the style, in general, is above the function;\r\nhere it is the reverse. Under the name of junior merchant, senior\r\nmerchant, writer, and other petty appellations of the counting-house,\r\nyou have magistrates of high dignity, you have administrators of\r\nrevenues truly royal, you have judges, civil, and in some respects\r\ncriminal, who pass judgment upon the greatest properties of a great\r\ncountry. The legal public emoluments that belong to them are very often\r\nso inadequate to the real dignity of the character, that it is\r\nimpossible, almost absolutely impossible, for the subordinate parts of\r\nit, which, though subordinate, are stations of power, to exist, as\r\nEnglishmen, who look at a fortune to be enjoyed at home as their\r\nultimate object, and to exist in a state of perfect incorruption in that\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of Europe, it is true that the greatest situations are\r\noften attended with but little emolument; yet still they are filled.\r\nWhy? Because reputation, glory, fame, the esteem, the love, the tears of\r\njoy which flow from happy sensibility, the honest applauses of a\r\ngrateful country, sometimes pay the cares, anxieties, and toils which\r\nwait on great situations in the commonwealth; and in these they pay in\r\nmoney what cannot be paid in fame and reputation. It is the reverse in\r\nthe service of the India Company. Glory is not the lot of subordinated\r\nmerit,--and all the subordinate parts of the gradation are officers who,\r\nin comparison with the offices and duties intrusted to them, are\r\nmiserably provided for; whereas the chief of each great Presidency has\r\nemoluments securing him against every mode of temptation. But if this\r\nhas not secured the head, we may easily judge how the members are to be\r\ncoerced. Mr. Hastings, at the head of the service, with high legal\r\nemoluments, has fouled his hands and sullied his government with bribes.\r\nHe has substituted oppression and tyranny in the place of legal\r\ngovernment. With all that unbounded, licentious power which he has\r\nassumed over the public revenues, instead of endeavoring to find a\r\nseries of gradual, progressive, honorable, and adequate rewards for the\r\npersons who serve the public in the subordinate, but powerful\r\nsituations, he has left them to prey upon the people without the\r\nsmallest degree of control. In default of honest emolument, there is the\r\nunbounded license of power; and, as one of the honestest and ablest\r\nservants of the Company said to me in conversation, the civil service of\r\nthe Company resembled the military service of the Mahrattas,--little\r\npay, but unbounded license to plunder. I do not say that some of the\r\nsalaries given in India would not sound well here; but when you consider\r\nthe nature of the trusts, the dignity of the situation, whatever the\r\nname of them may be, the powers that are granted, the hopes that every\r\nman has of establishing himself at home, I repeat, it is a source of\r\ninfinite grievance, of infinite abuse: of which source of corrupt power\r\nwe charge Mr. Hastings with having availed himself, in filling up the\r\nvoid of direct pay by finding out and countenancing every kind of\r\noblique and unjust emolument; though it must be confessed that he is\r\nfar from being solely guilty of this offence.\r\n\r\nAnother circumstance which distinguishes the East India Company is the\r\nyouth of the persons who are employed in the system of that service. The\r\nservants have almost universally been sent out to begin their progress\r\nand career in active occupation, and in the exercise of high authority,\r\nat that period of life which, in all other places, has been employed in\r\nthe course of a rigid education. To put the matter in a few words,--they\r\nare transferred from slippery youth to perilous independence, from\r\nperilous independence to inordinate expectations, from inordinate\r\nexpectations to boundless power. School-boys without tutors, minors\r\nwithout guardians, the world is let loose upon them with all its\r\ntemptations, and they are let loose upon the world with all the powers\r\nthat despotism involves.\r\n\r\nIt is further remarkable, these servants exercise what your Lordships\r\nare now exercising, high judicial powers, and they exercise them without\r\nthe smallest study of any law, either general or municipal. It is made a\r\nsort of rule in the service, a rule confirmed even by the attempts that\r\nwere made to correct it, (I mean confirmed by Sir Elijah Impey, when,\r\nunder the auspices of Mr. Hastings, he undertook to be legislator for\r\nIndia,) that the judicial character, the last in the order of legal\r\nprogress, that to which all professional men look up as the crown of\r\ntheir labors, that ultimate hope of men grown gray in professional\r\npractice, is among the first experimental situations of a Company's\r\nservant. It is expressly said in that body of regulations to which I\r\nallude, that the office and situation of a judge of the Dewanny Courts\r\nof Adawlut is to be filled by the _junior_ servants of the Company; and\r\nas the judicial emolument is not substantially equal to that of other\r\nsituations, the office of a judge is to be taken, as it were, _in\r\ntransitu_, as a passage to other offices not of a judicial nature. As\r\nsoon, therefore, as a young man has supplied the defects of his\r\neducation by the advantage of some experience, he is immediately\r\ntranslated to a totally different office; and another young man is\r\nsubstituted, to learn, at the expense of the property of India, to fill\r\na situation which, when he may be qualified to fill, he is no longer to\r\nhold.\r\n\r\nIt is in a great measure the same with regard to the other situations.\r\nThey are the situations of great statesmen, which, according to the\r\npractice of the world, require, to fill properly, rather a large\r\nconverse with men and much intercourse in life than deep study of\r\nbooks,--though that, too, has its eminent service. We know that in the\r\nhabits of civilized life, in cultivated society, there is imbibed by men\r\na good deal of the solid practice of government, of the true maxims of\r\nstate, and everything that enables a man to serve his country. But these\r\nmen are sent over to exercise functions at which a statesman here would\r\ntremble, without any theoretical study, and without any of that sort of\r\nexperience which, in mixed societies of business and converse, form men\r\ngradually and insensibly to great affairs. Low cunning, intrigue, and\r\nstratagem are soon acquired; but manly, durable policy, which never\r\nsacrifices the general interest to a partial or momentary advantage, is\r\nnot so cheaply formed in the human understanding.\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings, in his defence before the House of Commons, and in the\r\ndefences he has made before your Lordships, has lamented his own\r\nsituation in this particular. It was much to be lamented, indeed. How\r\nfar it will furnish justification, extenuation, or palliation of his\r\nconduct, when we come to examine that conduct, will be seen.\r\n\r\nThese circumstances in the system have in a great degree vitiated and\r\nperverted what is in reality (and many things are in reality) excellent\r\nin it. They have rendered the application of all correctives and\r\nremedies to abuse, at best, precarious in their operation. The laws that\r\nwe have made, the covenants which the Company has obliged its servants\r\nto enter into, the occasional orders that have been given, at least\r\nostensibly good, all have proved noxious to the country, instead of\r\nbeneficial.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate this point, I beg leave to observe to your Lordships, that\r\nthe servants of the Company are obliged to enter into that service not\r\nonly with an impression of the general duty which attaches upon all\r\nservants, but are obliged to engage in a specific covenant with their\r\nmasters to perform all the duties described in that covenant (which are\r\nall the duties of their relation) under heavy penalties. They are bound\r\nto a repetition of these covenants at every step of their progress, from\r\nwriter to factor, from factor to junior merchant, and from junior\r\nmerchant to senior merchant. They ought, according to the rule, to renew\r\nthese covenants at these times by something (I speak without offence)\r\nwhich may be said to resemble confirmation in the Church. They are\r\nobliged to renew their obligation in particular to receive no gifts,\r\ngratuities, or presents whatsoever.\r\n\r\nThis scheme of covenants would have been wise and proper, if it had\r\nbelonged to a judicious order, and rational, consistent scheme of\r\ndiscipline. The orders of the Company have forbidden their servants to\r\ntake any extraneous emoluments. The act of Parliament has fulminated\r\nagainst them. Clear, positive laws, and clear, positive private\r\nengagements, have no exception of circumstances in them, no difference\r\n_quoad majus et minus_; but every one who offends against the law is\r\nliable to the law. The consequence is this: he who has deviated but an\r\ninch from the straight line, he who has taken but one penny of unlawful\r\nemolument, (and all have taken many pennies of unlawful emolument,) does\r\nnot dare to complain of the most abandoned extortion and cruel\r\noppression in any of his fellow-servants. He who has taken a trifle,\r\nperhaps as the reward of a good action, is obliged to be silent, when he\r\nsees whole nations desolated around him. The great criminal at the head\r\nof the service has the laws in his hand; he is always able to prove the\r\nsmall offence, and crush the person who has committed it. This is one\r\ngrand source of Mr. Hastings's power. After he had got the better of the\r\nParliamentary commission, no complaint from any part of the service has\r\nappeared against Mr. Hastings. He is bold enough to state it as one\r\npresumption of his merit, that there has been no such complaint. No such\r\ncomplaint, indeed, can exist. The spirit of the corps would of itself\r\nalmost forbid it,--to which spirit an informer is the most odious and\r\ndetestable of all characters, and is hunted down, and has always been\r\nhunted down, as a common enemy. But here is a new security. Who can\r\ncomplain, or dares to accuse? The whole service is irregular: nobody is\r\nfree from small offences; and, as I have said, the great offender can\r\nalways crush the small one.\r\n\r\nIf you examine the correspondence of Mr. Hastings, you would imagine,\r\nfrom many expressions very deliberately used by him, that the Company's\r\nservice was made out of the very filth and dregs of human corruption;\r\nbut if you examine his conduct towards the corrupt body he describes,\r\nyou would imagine he had lived in the speculative schemes of visionary\r\nperfection. He was fourteen years at the head of that service; and there\r\nis not an instance, no, not one single instance, in which he endeavored\r\nto detect corruption, or that he ever, in any one single instance,\r\nattempted to punish it; but the whole service, with that whole mass of\r\nenormity which he attributes to it, slept, as it were, at once, under\r\nhis terror and his protection: under his protection, if they did not\r\ndare to move against him; under terror, from his power to pluck out\r\nindividuals and make a public example of them, whenever he thought fit.\r\nAnd therefore that service, under his guidance and influence, was,\r\nbeyond even what its own nature disposed it to, a service of\r\nconfederacy, a service of connivance, a service composed of various\r\nsystems of guilt, of which Mr. Hastings was the head and the protector.\r\nBut this general connivance he did not think sufficient to secure to him\r\nthe general support of the Indian interest. He went further. We shall\r\nprove to your Lordships, that, when the Company were driven by shame,\r\nnot by inclination, to order several prosecutions against delinquents in\r\ntheir service, Mr. Hastings, directly contrary to the duty of his\r\noffice, directly contrary to the express and positive law of the Court\r\nof Directors, which law Parliament had bound upon him as his rule of\r\naction, not satisfied with his long tacit connivance, ventured, before\r\nhe left his government, and among his last acts, to pass a general act\r\nof pardon and indemnity, and at once ordered the whole body of the\r\nprosecutions directed by his masters, the Company, to be discharged.\r\n\r\nHaving had fourteen years' lease of connivance to bestow, and giving at\r\nthe end a general release of all suits and actions, he now puts himself\r\nat the head of a vast body enriched by his bounties, connivances, and\r\nindemnities, and expects the support of those whom he had thus fully\r\nrewarded and discharged from the pursuit of the laws. You will find, in\r\nthe course of this business, that, when charges have been brought\r\nagainst him of any bribery, corruption, or other malversation, his\r\ncourse has been to answer little or nothing to that specific bribery,\r\ncorruption, or malversation: his way has been to call on the Court of\r\nDirectors to inquire of every servant who comes to Europe, and to say\r\nwhether there was any one man in it that will give him an ill word. He\r\nhas put himself into a situation in which he may always safely call to\r\nhis character, and will always find himself utterly incapable of\r\njustifying his conduct.\r\n\r\nSo far I have troubled your Lordships with the system of confederacy and\r\nconnivance, which, under his auspices, was the vital principle of almost\r\nthe whole service. There is one member of the service which I have\r\nomitted: but whether I ought to have put it first, or, as I do now,\r\nlast, I must confess I am at some loss; because, though it appears to be\r\nthe lowest (if any regular) part of the service, it is by far the most\r\nconsiderable and the most efficient, without a full consideration and\r\nexplanation of which hardly any part of the conduct of Mr. Hastings,\r\nand of many others that may be in his situation, can be fully\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\nI have given your Lordships an account of writers, factors, merchants,\r\nwho exercise the office of judges, lord chancellors, chancellors of the\r\nexchequer, ministers of state, and managers of great revenues. But there\r\nis another description of men, of more importance than them all, a\r\ndescription you have often heard of, but which has not been sufficiently\r\nexplained: I mean the _banian_. When the Company's service was no more\r\nthan mercantile, and the servants were generally unacquainted with the\r\ncountry, they used the intervention of certain factors among the\r\nnatives, which were called _banians_: we called them so, because they\r\nwere of the tribe or caste of the banians or merchants,--the Indians\r\nbeing generally distributed into trades according to their tribes. The\r\nname still continues, when the functions of the banians are totally\r\naltered. The banian is known by other appellations. He is called\r\n_dewan_, or steward; and, indeed, this is a term with more propriety\r\napplied to him in several of his functions. He is, by his name of\r\noffice, the steward of the household of the European gentleman: he has\r\nthe management of his affairs, and the ordering of his servants. He is\r\nhimself a domestic servant, and generally chosen out of that class of\r\nnatives who, by being habituated to misery and subjection, can submit to\r\nany orders, and are fit for any of the basest services. Trained under\r\noppression, (it is the true education,) they are fit to oppress others.\r\nThey serve an apprenticeship of servitude to qualify them for the trade\r\nof tyranny. They know all the devices, all the little frauds, all the\r\nartifices and contrivances, the whole panoply of the defensive armor by\r\nwhich ingenious slavery secures itself against the violence of power.\r\nThey know all the lurking-holes, all the winding recesses, of the\r\nunfortunate; and they hunt out distress and misery even to their last\r\nretreats. They have suffered themselves; but, far from being taught by\r\nthose sufferings to abstain from rigor, they have only learned the\r\nmethods of afflicting their fellow-slaves. They have the best\r\nintelligence of what is done in England. The moment a Company's servant\r\narrives in India, and his English connections are known to be powerful,\r\nsome of that class of people immediately take possession of him, as if\r\nhe were their inheritance. They have knowledge of the country and its\r\naffairs; they have money; they have the arts of making money. The\r\ngentleman who comes from England has none of these; he enters into that\r\nworld, as he enters into the world at large, naked. His portion is great\r\nsimplicity, great indigence, and a strong disposition to relieve\r\nhimself. The banian, once in possession, employs his tyranny, not only\r\nover the native people of his country, but often over the master\r\nhimself, who has little other share in the proceedings of his servant\r\nbut in giving him the ticket of his name to mark that he is connected\r\nwith and supported by an European who is himself well connected and\r\nsupported at home. This is a commission which nothing can resist. From\r\nthat moment forward it is not the Englishman, it is the black banian,\r\nthat is the master. The nominal master often lives from his hand. We\r\nknow how young men are sent out of this country; we know how happy we\r\nare to hear soon that they are no longer a burden to their friends and\r\nparents. The banian knows it, too. He supplies the young servant with\r\nmoney. He has him under his power: first, from the necessity of\r\nemploying such a man; and next, (and this is the more important of the\r\ntwo,) he has that dreadful power over his master which every creditor\r\nhas over his debtor. Actions the most abhorrent to his nature he must\r\nsee done before his face, and thousands and thousands worse are done in\r\nhis absence, and he dare not complain. The banian extorts, robs,\r\nplunders, and then gives him just what proportion of the spoil he\r\npleases. If the master should murmur, the very power that was sent over\r\nto protect the people of India from these very abuses, (the best things\r\nbeing perverted, when applied to unknown objects and put into unsuitable\r\nsituations,) the very laws of England, by making the recovery of debts\r\nmore easy, infinitely increase the power of the banian over his master.\r\nThus the Supreme Court of Justice, the destined corrector of all abuses,\r\nbecomes a collateral security for that abominable tyranny exercised by\r\nthe moneyed banians over Europeans as well as the natives. So that,\r\nwhile we are here boasting of the British power in the East, we are in\r\nperhaps more than half our service nothing but the inferior, miserable\r\ninstruments of the tyranny which the lowest part of the natives of India\r\nexercise, to the disgrace of the British authority, and to the ruin of\r\nall that is respectable among their own countrymen. They have subverted\r\nthe first houses, totally ruined and undone the country, cheated and\r\ndefrauded the revenue,--the master a silent, sometimes a melancholy\r\nspectator, until some office of high emolument has emancipated him. This\r\nhas often been the true reason that the Company's servants in India, in\r\norder to free themselves from this horrid and atrocious servitude, are\r\nobliged to become instruments of another tyranny, and must prostitute\r\nthemselves to men in power, in order to obtain some office that may\r\nenable them to escape the servitudes below, and enable them to pay their\r\ndebts. And thus many have become the instruments of Mr. Hastings.\r\n\r\nThese banians, or dewans, were originally among the lower castes in the\r\ncountry. But now, it is true, that, after seeing the power and profits\r\nof these men,--that there is neither power, profession, nor occupation\r\nto be had, which a reputable person can exercise, but through that\r\nchannel,--men of higher castes, and born to better things, have thrown\r\nthemselves into that disgraceful servitude, have become menial servants\r\nto Englishmen, that they might rise by their degradation. But whoever\r\nthey are, or of whatever birth, they have equally prostituted their\r\nintegrity, they have equally lost their character; and, once entered\r\ninto that course of life, there is no difference between the best castes\r\nand the worst. That system Mr. Hastings confirmed, established,\r\nincreased, and made the instrument of the most austere tyranny, of the\r\nbasest peculations, and the most scandalous and iniquitous extortions.\r\n\r\nIn the description I have given of banians a distinction is to be made.\r\nYour Lordships must distinguish the banians of the British servants in\r\nsubordinate situations and the banians who are such to persons in higher\r\nauthority. In the latter case the banian is in strict subordination,\r\nbecause he may always be ruined by his superior; whereas in the former\r\nit is always in his power to ruin his nominal superior. It was not\r\nthrough fear, but voluntarily, and not for the banian's purposes, but\r\nhis own, Mr. Hastings has brought forward his banian. He seated him in\r\nthe houses of the principal nobility, and invested him with farms of the\r\nrevenue; he has given him enormous jobs; he has put him over the heads\r\nof a nobility which, for their grandeur, antiquity, and dignity, might\r\nalmost be matched with your Lordships. He has made him supreme\r\necclesiastical judge, judge even of the very castes, in the preservation\r\nof the separate rules and separate privileges of which that people\r\nexists. He who has dominion over the caste has an absolute power over\r\nsomething more than life and fortune.\r\n\r\nSuch is that first, or last, (I know not which to call it,) order in the\r\nCompany's service called a banian. The _mutseddies_, clerks,\r\naccountants, of Calcutta, generally fall under this description. Your\r\nLordships will see hereafter the necessity of giving you, in the opening\r\nthe case, an idea of the situation of a banian. You will see, as no\r\nEnglishman, properly speaking, acts by himself, that he must be made\r\nresponsible for that person called his banian,--for the power he either\r\nuses under him, or the power he has acquired over him. The banian\r\nescapes, in the night of his complexion and situation, the inquiry that\r\na white man cannot stand before in this country. Through the banians, or\r\nother black natives, a bad servant of the Company receives his bribes.\r\nThrough them he decides falsely against the titles of litigants in the\r\ncourt of castes, or in the offices of public registry. Through them Mr.\r\nHastings has exercised oppressions which, I will venture to say, in his\r\nown name, in his own character, daring as he is, (and he is the most\r\ndaring criminal that ever existed,) he never would dare to practise.\r\nMany, if not most, of the iniquities of his interior bad administration\r\nhave been perpetrated through these banians, or other native agents and\r\nconfidants; and we shall show you that he is not satisfied with one of\r\nthem, confiding few of his secrets to Europeans, and hardly any of his\r\ninstruments, either native or European, knowing the secrets of each\r\nother. This is the system of banianism, and of concealment, which Mr.\r\nHastings, instead of eradicating out of the service, has propagated by\r\nexample and by support, and enlarged by converting even Europeans into\r\nthat dark and insidious character.\r\n\r\nI have explained, or endeavored to explain, to your Lordships these\r\ncircumstances of the true spirit, genius, and character, more than the\r\nostensible institutions of the Company's service: I now shall beg leave\r\nto bring before you one institution, taken from the mercantile\r\nconstitution of the Company, so excellent, that I will venture to say\r\nthat human wisdom has never exceeded it. In this excellent institution\r\nthe counting-house gave lessons to the state. The active, awakened, and\r\nenlightened principle of self-interest will provide a better system for\r\nthe guard of that interest than the cold, drowsy wisdom of those who\r\nprovide for a good out of themselves ever contrived for the public. The\r\nplans sketched by private prudence for private interest, the regulations\r\nby mercantile men for their mercantile purposes, when they can be\r\napplied to the discipline and order of the state, produce a discipline\r\nand order which no state should be ashamed to copy. The Company's\r\nmercantile regulations are admirably fitted for the government of a\r\nremote, large, disjointed empire. As merchants, having factors abroad\r\nin distant parts of the world, they have obliged them to a minuteness\r\nand strictness of register, and to a regularity of correspondence, which\r\nno state has ever used in the same degree with regard to its public\r\nministers. The Company has made it a fundamental part of their\r\nconstitution, that almost their whole government shall be a written\r\ngovernment. Your Lordships will observe, in the course of the\r\nproceeding, the propriety of opening fully to you this circumstance in\r\nthe government of India,--that is, that the Company's government is a\r\ngovernment of writing, a government of record. The strictest court of\r\njustice, in its proceeding, is not more, perhaps not so much a court of\r\nrecord as the India Company's executive service is, or ought to be, in\r\nall its proceedings.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, they oblige their servants to keep a journal or\r\ndiary of all their transactions, public and private: they are bound to\r\ndo this by an express covenant. They oblige them, as a corrective upon\r\nthat diary, to keep a letter-book, in which all their letters are to be\r\nregularly entered. And they are bound by the same covenant to produce\r\nall those books upon requisition, although they should be mixed with\r\naffairs concerning their own private negotiations and transactions of\r\ncommerce, or their closest and most retired concerns in private life.\r\nBut as the great corrective of all, they have contrived that every\r\nproceeding in public council shall be written,--no debates merely\r\nverbal. The arguments, first or last, are to be in writing, and\r\nrecorded. All other bodies, the Houses of Lords, Commons, Privy Council,\r\nCabinet Councils for secret state deliberations, enter only resolves,\r\ndecisions, and final resolutions of affairs: the argument, the\r\ndiscussion, the dissent, does very rarely, if at all, appear. But the\r\nCompany has proceeded much further, and done much more wisely, because\r\nthey proceeded upon mercantile principles; and they have provided,\r\neither by orders or course of office, that all shall be written,--the\r\nproposition, the argument, the dissent. This is not confined to their\r\ngreat Council; but this order ought to be observed, as I conceive, (and\r\nI see considerable traces of it in practice,) in every Provincial\r\nCouncil, whilst the Provincial Councils existed, and even down to the\r\nminutest ramification of their service. These books, in a progression\r\nfrom the lowest Councils to the highest Presidency, are ordered to be\r\ntransmitted, duplicate and triplicate, by every ship that sails to\r\nEurope. On this system an able servant of the Company, and high in their\r\nservice, has recorded his opinion, and strongly expressed his\r\nsentiments. Writing to the Court of Directors, he says, \"It ought to be\r\nremembered, that the basis upon which you rose to power, and have been\r\nable to stand the shock of repeated convulsions, has been the accuracy\r\nand simplicity of mercantile method, which makes every transaction in\r\nyour service and every expenditure a matter of record.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, this method not only must produce to them, if strictly\r\nobserved, a more accurate idea of the nature of their affairs and the\r\nnature of their expenditures, but it must afford them no trivial\r\nopportunity and means of knowing the true characters of their servants,\r\ntheir capacities, their ways of thinking, the turn and bias of their\r\nminds. If well employed, and but a little improved, the East India\r\nCompany possessed an advantage unknown before to the chief of a remote\r\ngovernment. In the most remote parts of the world, and in the minutest\r\nparts of a remote service, everything came before the principal with a\r\ndomestic accuracy and local familiarity. It was, in the power of a\r\nDirector, sitting in London, to form an accurate judgment of every\r\nincident that happened upon the Ganges and the Gogra.\r\n\r\nThe use of this recorded system did not consist only in the facility of\r\ndiscovering what the nature of their affairs and the character and\r\ncapacity of their servants was, but it furnished the means of detecting\r\ntheir misconduct, frequently of proving it too, and of producing the\r\nevidence of it judicially under their own hands. For your Lordships must\r\nhave observed that it is rare indeed, that, in a continued course of\r\nevil practices, any uniform method of proceeding will serve the purposes\r\nof the delinquent. Innocence is plain, direct, and simple: guilt is a\r\ncrooked, intricate, inconstant, and various thing. The iniquitous job of\r\nto-day may be covered by specious reasons; but when the job of iniquity\r\nof to-morrow succeeds, the reasons that have colored the first crime may\r\nexpose the second malversation. The man of fraud falls into\r\ncontradiction, prevarication, confusion. This hastens, this facilitates,\r\nconviction. Besides, time is not allowed for corrupting the records.\r\nThey are flown out of their hands, they are in Europe, they are safe in\r\nthe registers of the Company, perhaps they are under the eye of\r\nParliament, before the writers of them have time to invent an excuse for\r\na direct contrary conduct to that to which their former pretended\r\nprinciples applied. This is a great, a material part of the constitution\r\nof the Company. My Lords, I do not think it to be much apologized for,\r\nif I repeat, that this is the fundamental regulation of that service,\r\nand which, if preserved in the first instance, as it ought to be, in\r\nofficial practice in India, and then used as it ought to be in England,\r\nwould afford such a mode of governing a great, foreign, dispersed\r\nempire, as, I will venture to say, few countries ever possessed, even in\r\ngoverning the most limited and narrow jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nIt was the great business of Mr. Hastings's policy to subvert this great\r\npolitical edifice. His first mode of subverting it was by commanding the\r\npublic ministers, paid by the Company, to deliver their correspondence\r\nupon the most critical and momentous affairs to him, in order to be\r\nsuppressed and destroyed at his pleasure. To support him in this plan of\r\nspoliation, he has made a mischievous distinction in public business\r\nbetween public and private correspondence. The Company's orders and\r\ncovenants made none. There are, readily I admit, thousands of occasions\r\nin which it is not proper to divulge promiscuously a private\r\ncorrespondence, though on public affairs, to the world; but there is no\r\noccasion in which it is not a necessary duty, on requisition, to\r\ncommunicate your correspondence to those who form the paramount\r\ngovernment, on whose interests and on whose concerns and under whose\r\nauthority this correspondence has been carried on. The very same reasons\r\nwhich require secrecy with regard to others demand the freest\r\ncommunication to them. But Mr. Hastings has established principles of\r\nconfidence and secrecy towards himself which have cut off all confidence\r\nbetween the Directors and their ministers, and effectually kept them at\r\nleast out of the secret of their own affairs.\r\n\r\nWithout entering into all the practices by which he has attempted to\r\nmaim the Company's records, I shall state one more to your\r\nLordships,--that is, his avowed appointment of spies and under-agents,\r\nwho shall carry on the real state business, while there are public and\r\nostensible agents who are not in the secret. The correspondence of those\r\nprivate agents he holds in his own hands, communicates as he thinks\r\nproper, but most commonly withholds. There remains nothing for the\r\nDirectors but the shell and husk of a dry, formal, official\r\ncorrespondence, which neither means anything nor was intended to mean\r\nanything.\r\n\r\nThese are some of the methods by which he has defeated the purposes of\r\nthe excellent institution of a recorded administration. But there are\r\ncases to be brought before this court in which he has laid the axe at\r\nonce to the root,--which was, by delegating out of his own hands a great\r\ndepartment of the powers of the Company, which he was himself bound to\r\nexecute, to a board which was not bound to record their deliberations\r\nwith the same strictness as he himself was bound. He appointed of his\r\nown usurped authority a board for the administration of the revenue, the\r\nmembers of which were expressly dispensed from recording their dissents,\r\nuntil they chose it; and in that office, as in a great gulf, a most\r\nimportant part of the Company's transactions has been buried.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding his unwearied pains in the work of spoliation, some\r\nprecious fragments are left, which we ought infinitely to value,--by\r\nwhich we may learn, and lament, the loss of what he has destroyed. If it\r\nwere not for those inestimable fragments and wrecks of the recorded\r\ngovernment which have been saved from the destruction which Mr.\r\nHastings intended for them all, the most shameful enormities that have\r\never disgraced a government or harassed a people would only be known in\r\nthis country by secret whispers and unauthenticated anecdotes; the\r\ndisgracer's of government, the vexers and afflicters of mankind, instead\r\nof being brought before an awful public tribunal, might have been\r\nhonored with the highest distinctions and rewards their country has to\r\nbestow; and sordid bribery, base peculation, iron-handed extortion,\r\nfierce, unrelenting tyranny, might themselves have been invested with\r\nthose sacred robes of justice before which this day they have cause to\r\ntremble.\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings, sensible of what he suffers from this register of acts and\r\nopinions, has endeavored to discredit and ruin what remains of it. He\r\nrefuses, in his defence to the House of Commons, in letters to the Court\r\nof Directors, in various writings and declarations, he refuses to be\r\ntried by his own recorded declarations; he refuses to be bound by his\r\nown opinions, delivered under his own hand. He knows that he and the\r\nrecord cannot exist together. He knows that what remains of the written\r\nconstitution which he has not destroyed is enough to destroy him. He\r\nclaims a privilege of systematic inconstancy, a privilege of\r\nprevarication, a privilege of contradiction,--a privilege of not only\r\nchanging his conduct, but the principles of his conduct, whenever it\r\nsuits his occasions. But I hope your Lordships will show the destroyers\r\nof that wise constitution, and the destroyers of those records which are\r\nto be the securities against malversation in office, the discoverers and\r\navengers of it, that whoever destroys the discoverer establishes the\r\niniquity; that, therefore, your Lordships will bind him to his own\r\ndeclarations, given on record under his own hand; that you will say to\r\nthis unfaithful servant of the Company, what was said to another\r\nunfaithful person upon a far less occasion by a far greater authority,\r\n\"Out of thy own mouth will I judge thee, thou wicked servant.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHaving gone through what I have been instructed might be necessary to\r\nstate to your Lordships concerning the Company's constitution, (I mean\r\nthe real inside, and not the shell of its constitution,)--having stated\r\nthe abuses that existed in it,--having stated how Mr. Hastings\r\nendeavored to perpetuate and to increase and to profit of the abuse, and\r\nhow he has systematically endeavored to destroy, and has in some\r\ninstances in fact destroyed, many things truly excellent in that\r\nconstitution,--if I have not wasted your time in explanation of matters\r\nthat you are already well acquainted with, I shall next beg leave to\r\nstate to you the abuse in some particulars of the other part of the\r\npublic authority which the Company acquired over the natives of India,\r\nin virtue of the royal charter of the present Mogul emperor, in the year\r\n1766 [1765?].\r\n\r\nMy Lords, that you may the better judge of the abuse Mr. Hastings has\r\nmade of the powers vested in him, it will be expedient to consider a\r\nlittle who the people are to whose prejudice he has abused these powers.\r\nI shall explain this point with as much brevity as is consistent with\r\nthe distinctness with which I mean to bring the whole before your\r\nLordships; and I beg to observe to you that this previous discourse,\r\nrather explanatory than accusatorial, (if I may use the expression,) is\r\nmeant rather to elucidate the nature of the matter to come before you in\r\nregular charges than as proof of the charges themselves.\r\n\r\nI know that a good deal of latitude is allowed to advocates, when\r\nopening a cause in a private court, to indulge themselves in their\r\nnarratives leading to the charges they intend to bring. They are not\r\nalways called to the strictest account for such prefatory matter,\r\nbecause the court, when it comes to judge, sifts and distinguishes it\r\nfrom the points to be strictly proved, and on whose merits the cause\r\nrelies. But I wish your Lordships to know, that, with the high opinion I\r\nhave of your gravity, (and it is impossible for a man to conceive a\r\nhigher,) and sensible of the weight of those I represent at this place,\r\nnamely, the Commons of Great Britain, I should be sorry that any one\r\nsubstantial fact, even in this explanatory opening, or even the color of\r\nthe fact, should be alleged, which, when called upon, I should not be\r\nready to make good to you by proof,--I mean, by proof adapted to its\r\nnature: public opinion, by evidence of public opinion; by record, that\r\nto which record is applicable; by oral testimony, things to which oral\r\ntestimony alone can be produced; and, last of all, that which is matter\r\nof historic proof, by historic evidence. This I hope to do with the\r\nusual allowance to errors and mistakes, which is the claim of human\r\ninfirmity.\r\n\r\nThen, my Lords, two distinct people inhabit India. Two sorts of people\r\ninhabit the same country, as totally distinct from each other, in\r\ncharacters, lives, opinions, prejudices, and manners, as the inhabitants\r\nof countries most remote from each other. For both of these descriptions\r\nMr. Hastings was bound to provide equally, agreeable to the terms of\r\nthe charter which the Company received from the lawful governing power\r\nof that country: a charter received at its own solicitation; a charter\r\nnot forced upon us by a superior power, but given at the immediate\r\nsolicitation of the principal servants belonging to the Company; a\r\ncharter solemnly accepted by the Company, and by them, I am very sorry\r\nto say, little regarded,--or, at least, little regarded by their\r\nprincipal servants.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, the first description of people who are subjected virtually to\r\nthe British empire through those mediums which I have described to you\r\nare the original inhabitants of Hindostan, who have in all time, and\r\nbeyond all the eras which we use, (I mean always the two grand eras\r\nexcepted,) been the aboriginal inhabitants and proprietors of that\r\ncountry,--with manners, religion, customs, and usages appropriated to\r\nthemselves, and little resembling those of the rest of mankind. This\r\ndescription of men is commonly called Gentoos. The system and principle\r\nof that government is locality. Their laws, their manners, their\r\nreligion are all local.\r\n\r\nTheir legislator, whoever he was, (for who he was is a matter lost in\r\nthe mists of a most obscure antiquity,) had it as a great leading\r\nprinciple of his policy to connect the people with their soil.\r\nAccordingly, by one of those anomalies which a larger acquaintance with\r\nour species daily discovers, and which perhaps an attentive reflection\r\nmight explain in the nature of man, this aboriginal people of\r\nIndia,--who are the softest in their manners of any of our race,\r\napproaching almost to feminine tenderness,--who are formed\r\nconstitutionally benevolent, and, in many particulars, made to fill a\r\nlarger circle of benevolence than our morals take in,--who extend their\r\ngood-will to the whole animal creation,--these people are, of all\r\nnations, the most unalliable to any other part of mankind. They cannot,\r\nthe highest orders of them, at least, cannot, come into contact with any\r\nother. That bond which is one of the chief instruments of society, and\r\nwhich, supporting the individual, connects the species, can have no\r\nexistence with them: I mean the convivial bond. That race can be held to\r\nno other by that great link of life. No Hindoo can mix at meals even\r\nwith those on whom he depends for the meat he eats. This circumstance\r\nrenders it difficult for us to enter with due sympathy into their\r\nconcerns, or for them to enter into ours, even when we meet on the same\r\nground. But there are other circumstances which render our intercourse,\r\nin our mutual relation, very full of difficulty. The sea is between us.\r\nThe mass of that element, which, by appearing to disconnect, unites\r\nmankind, is to them a forbidden road. It is a great gulf fixed between\r\nyou and them,--not so much that elementary gulf, but that gulf which\r\nmanners, opinions, and laws have radicated in the very nature of the\r\npeople. None of their high castes, without great danger to his\r\nsituation, religion, rank, and estimation, can ever pass the sea; and\r\nthis forbids, forever, all direct communication between that country and\r\nthis. That material and affecting circumstance, my Lords, makes it ten\r\ntimes more necessary, since they cannot come to us, to keep a strict eye\r\nupon all persons who go to them. It imposes upon us a stricter duty to\r\nguard with a firm and powerful vigilance those whose principles of\r\nconscience weaken their principles of self-defence. If we undertake to\r\ngovern the inhabitants of such a country, we must govern them upon their\r\nown principles and maxims, and not upon ours. We must not think to force\r\nthem into the narrow circle of our ideas; we must extend ours to take in\r\ntheir system of opinions and rites, and the necessities which result\r\nfrom both: all change on their part is absolutely impracticable. We have\r\nmore versatility of character and manners, and it is we who must\r\nconform. We know what the empire of opinion is in human nature. I had\r\nalmost said that the law of opinion was human nature itself. It is,\r\nhowever, the strongest principle in the composition of the frame of the\r\nhuman mind; and more of the happiness and unhappiness of mankind resides\r\nin that inward principle than in all external circumstances put\r\ntogether. But if such is the empire of opinion even amongst us, it has a\r\npure, unrestrained, complete, and despotic power amongst them. The\r\nvariety of balanced opinions in our minds weakens the force of each: for\r\nin Europe, sometimes, the laws of religion differ from the laws of the\r\nland; sometimes the laws of the land differ from our laws of honor; our\r\nlaws of honor are full of caprice, differing from those other laws, and\r\nsometimes differing from themselves: but there the laws of religion, the\r\nlaws of the land, and the laws of honor are all united and consolidated\r\nin one invariable system, and bind men by eternal and indissoluble bonds\r\nto the rules of what, amongst them, is called his _caste_.\r\n\r\nIt may be necessary just to state to your Lordships what a _caste_ is.\r\nThe Gentoo people, from the oldest time, have been distributed into\r\nvarious orders, all of them hereditary: these family orders are called\r\ncastes; these castes are the fundamental part of the constitution of\r\nthe Gentoo commonwealth, both in their church and in their state.\r\n\r\nYour Lordships are born to hereditary honors in the chief of your\r\nhouses; the rest mix with the people. With the Gentoos, they who are\r\nborn noble can never fall into any second rank. They are divided into\r\nfour orders,--the Brahmins, the Chittery, the Bice, and the Soodur, with\r\nmany subdivisions in each. An eternal barrier is placed between them.\r\nThe higher cannot pass into the lower; the lower cannot rise into the\r\nhigher. They have all their appropriated rank, place, and situation, and\r\ntheir appropriated religion too, which is essentially different in its\r\nrites and ceremonies, sometimes in its object, in each of those castes.\r\nA man who is born in the highest caste, which at once unites what would\r\nbe tantamount in this country to the dignity of the peerage and the\r\nennobled sanctity of the episcopal character,--the Brahmin, who sustains\r\nthese characters, if he loses his caste, does not fall into an inferior\r\norder, the Chittery, the Bice, or the Soodur, but he is thrown at once\r\nout of all ranks of society. He is precipitated from the proudest\r\nelevation of respect and honor to a bottomless abyss of contempt,--from\r\nglory to infamy,--from purity to pollution,--from sanctity to\r\nprofanation. No honest occupation is open to him; his children are no\r\nlonger his children; their parent loses that name; the conjugal bond is\r\ndissolved. Few survive this most terrible of all calamities. To speak to\r\nan Indian of his caste is to speak to him of his all.\r\n\r\nBut the rule of caste has, with them, given one power more to fortune\r\nthan the manners of any other nation were ever known to do. For it is\r\nsingular, the caste may be lost, not only by certain voluntary crimes,\r\nbut by certain involuntary sufferings, disgraces, and pollutions, that\r\nare utterly out of their power to prevent. Those who have patiently\r\nsubmitted to imprisonment,--those who have not flinched from the\r\nscourge,--those who have been as unmoved as marble under torture,--those\r\nwho have laughed at the menaces of death itself,--have instantly given\r\nway, when it has been attempted to subject them to any of those\r\npollutions by which they lose caste. To this caste they are bound by all\r\nlaws of all descriptions, human and divine; and inveterate usage has\r\nradicated it in them to a depth and with an adhesion with which no other\r\nknown prejudice has been known to exist. Tyranny is therefore armed\r\nagainst them with a greater variety of weapons than are found in its\r\nordinary stores.\r\n\r\nThis, amongst a thousand other considerations, speaks to us in very\r\nauthoritative language with what care and circumspection we ought to\r\nhandle people so delicate. In the course of this trial your Lordships\r\nwill see with horror the use which Mr. Hastings made, through several of\r\nhis wicked and abominable instruments, chosen from the natives\r\nthemselves, of these superadded means of oppression. I shall prove, in\r\nthe course of this trial, that he has put his own menial domestic\r\nservant,--a wretch totally dependent,--a wretch grossly ignorant,--the\r\ncommon instrument of his bribery and peculation,--he has enthroned him,\r\nI say, on the first seat of ecclesiastical jurisdiction, which was to\r\ndecide upon the castes of all those people, including their rank, their\r\nfamily, their honor, and their happiness here, and, in their judgment,\r\ntheir salvation hereafter. Under the awe of this power, no man dared to\r\nbreathe a murmur against his tyranny. Fortified in this security, he\r\nsays, \"Who complains of me!\"--\"No, none of us dare complain of you,\"\r\nsays the trembling Gentoo. \"No! your menial servant has my caste in his\r\npower.\"--I shall not trouble your Lordships with mentioning others; it\r\nwas enough that Cantoo Baboo, and Ginga Govind Sing, names to which your\r\nLordships are to be familiarized hereafter,--it is enough that those\r\npersons had the caste and character of all the people of Bengal in their\r\nhands. Through them he has taken effectual security against all\r\ncomplaint. Your Lordships will hence discern how very necessary it is\r\nbecome that some other personage should intervene, should take upon him\r\ntheir representation, and by his freedom and his power should supply the\r\ndefects arising from their servitude and their impotence. The Commons of\r\nGreat Britain charge themselves with this character.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, these Gentoo people are the original people of Hindostan. They\r\nare still, beyond comparison, the most numerous. Faults this nation may\r\nhave; but God forbid we should pass judgment upon people who framed\r\ntheir laws and institutions prior to our insect origin of yesterday!\r\nWith all the faults of their nature and errors of their institutions,\r\ntheir institutions, which act so powerfully on their natures, have two\r\nmaterial characteristics which entitle them to respect: first, great\r\nforce and stability; and next, excellent moral and civil effects.\r\n\r\nTheir stability has been proved by their holding on an uniform tenor for\r\na duration commensurate to all the empires with which history has made\r\nus acquainted; and they still exist in a green old age, with all the\r\nreverence of antiquity, and with all the passion that people have to\r\nnovelty and change. They have stood firm on their ancient base; they\r\nhave cast their roots deep in their native soil,--perhaps because they\r\nhave never spread them anywhere else than in their native soil. Their\r\nblood, their opinions, and the soil of their country make one consistent\r\npiece, admitting no mixture, no adulteration, no improvement:\r\naccordingly, their religion has made no converts, their dominion has\r\nmade no conquests; but in proportion as their laws and opinions were\r\nconcentred within themselves, and hindered from spreading abroad, they\r\nhave doubled their force at home. They have existed in spite of\r\nMahomedan and Portuguese bigotry,--in spite of Tartarian and Arabian\r\ntyranny,--in spite of all the fury of successive foreign conquest,--in\r\nspite of a more formidable foe, the avarice of the English dominion.\r\n\r\nI have spoken now, my Lords, of what their principles are, their laws\r\nand religious institutions, in point of force and stability; I have\r\ngiven instances of their force in the very circumstance in which all the\r\ninstitutions of mankind in other respects show their weakness. They have\r\nexisted, when the country has been otherwise subdued. This alone\r\nfurnishes full proof that there must be some powerful influence\r\nresulting from them beyond all our little fashionable theories upon such\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\nThe second consideration in the Gentoo institutions is their beneficial\r\neffects, moral and civil. The policy, civil or religious, or, as theirs\r\nis, composed of both, that makes a people happy and a state flourishing,\r\n(putting further and higher considerations out of the way, which are not\r\nnow before us,) must undoubtedly, so far as human considerations\r\nprevail, be a policy wisely conceived in any scheme of government. It\r\nis confirmed by all observation, that, where the Hindoo religion has\r\nbeen established, that country has been flourishing. We have seen some\r\npatterns remaining to this day. The very country which is to be the\r\nsubject of your Lordships' judicial inquiry is an instance, by an entire\r\nchange of government, of the different effects resulting from the\r\nrapacity of a foreign hand, and the paternal, lenient, protecting arm of\r\na native government, formed on the long connection of prejudice and\r\npower. I shall give you its state under the Hindoo government from a\r\nbook written by a very old servant of the Company, whose authority is of\r\nthe greater weight, as the very destruction of all this scheme of\r\ngovernment is the great object of the author.\r\n\r\nThe author, Mr. Holwell, divides the country of Bengal into its\r\ndifferent provinces. He supposes what they then paid to the supreme\r\ngovernment; he supposes what the country is capable of yielding; and his\r\nproject is, to change entirely the application of the revenues of the\r\ncountry, and to secure the whole into the hands of government. In\r\nenumerating these provinces, at last he comes to the province of\r\nBurdwan.\r\n\r\n\"In truth,\" (says this author,) \"it would be almost cruelty to molest\r\nthis happy people; for in this district are the only vestiges of the\r\nbeauty, purity, piety, regularity, equity, and strictness of the ancient\r\nHindostan government. Here the property as well as the liberty of the\r\npeople are inviolate. Here no robberies are heard of, either public or\r\nprivate. The traveller, either with or without merchandise, becomes the\r\nimmediate care of the government, which allots him guards, without any\r\nexpense, to conduct him from stage to stage; and these are accountable\r\nfor the safety and accommodation of his person and effects. At the end\r\nof the first stage he is delivered over, with certain benevolent\r\nformalities, to the guards of the next, who, after interrogating the\r\ntraveller as to the usage he had received in his journey, dismiss the\r\nfirst guard with a written certificate of their behavior, and a receipt\r\nfor the traveller and his effects; which certificate and receipt are\r\nreturnable to the commanding officer of the first stage, who registers\r\nthe same, and regularly reports it to the rajah.\r\n\r\n\"In this form the traveller is passed through the country; and if he\r\nonly passes, he is not suffered to be at any expense for food,\r\naccommodation, or carriage for his merchandise or baggage: but it is\r\notherwise, if he is permitted to make any residence in one place above\r\nthree days, unless occasioned by sickness, or any unavoidable accident.\r\nIf anything is lost in this district,--for instance, a bag of money or\r\nother valuables,--the person who finds it hangs it upon the next tree,\r\nand gives notice to the nearest _chowkey_, or place of guard, the\r\nofficer of which orders immediate publication of the same by beat of\r\n_tomtom_, or drum.\"\r\n\r\nThese, my Lords, are the effects universally produced by the Hindoo\r\npolity throughout that vast region, before it was distorted and put out\r\nof frame by the barbarism of foreign conquests. Some choice, reserved\r\nspots continued to flourish under it to the year 1756. Some remained\r\ntill Mr. Hastings obtained the means of utterly defacing them. Such was\r\nthe prospect of Benares under the happy government of Bulwant Sing.\r\nSuch was the happy state of the same Benares in the happy days of Cheyt\r\nSing, until, in the year 1781, Mr. Hastings introduced _his_ reform into\r\nthat country.\r\n\r\nHaving stated the general outline of the manners of the original people\r\nof Hindostan, having stated the general principles of their policy,\r\nwhich either prohibit connection, or oblige us to a connection very\r\ndifferent from what we have hitherto used towards them, I shall leave it\r\nto your Lordships' judgment whether you will suffer such fair monuments\r\nof wisdom and benevolence to be defaced by the rapacity of your\r\ngovernors. I hope I have not gone out of my way to bring before you any\r\ncircumstance relative to the Gentoo religion and manners, further than\r\nas they relate to the spirit of our government over them; for though\r\nthere never was such food for the curiosity of the human mind as is\r\nfound in the manners of this people, I pass it totally over.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI wish to divide this preliminary view into six periods; and your\r\nLordships will consider that of the Hindoos, which I have now mentioned,\r\nas the first era.\r\n\r\nThe second era is an era of great misfortune to that country, and to the\r\nworld in general: I mean, the time of the prophet Mahomed. The\r\nenthusiasm which animated his first followers, the despotic power which\r\nreligion obtained through that enthusiasm, and the advantages derived\r\nfrom both over the enervated great empires, and broken, disunited,\r\nlesser governments of the world, extended the influence of that proud\r\nand domineering sect from the banks of the Ganges to the banks of the\r\nLoire.\r\n\r\nThis second period is the era of the Arabs. These people made a great\r\nand lasting impression on India. They established, very early, Mahomedan\r\nsovereigns in all parts of it, particularly in the kingdom of Bengal,\r\nwhich is the principal object of our present inquiry. They held that\r\nkingdom for a long series of years, under a dynasty of thirty-three\r\nkings,--having begun their conquest and founded their dominion in Bengal\r\nnot very long after the time of their prophet.\r\n\r\nThese people, when they first settled in India, attempted, with the\r\nferocious arm of their prophetic sword, to change the religion and\r\nmanners of that country; but at length perceiving that their cruelty\r\nwearied out itself, and never could touch the constancy of the\r\nsufferers, they permitted the native people of the country to remain in\r\nquiet, and left the Mahomedan religion to operate upon them as it could,\r\nby appealing to the ambition or avarice of the great, or by taking the\r\nlower people, who had lost their castes, into this new sect, and thus,\r\nfrom the refuse of the Gentoo, increasing the bounds of the Mahomedan\r\nreligion. They left many of the ancient rajahs of the country possessed\r\nof an inferior sovereignty; and where the strength of the country, or\r\nother circumstances, would not permit this subordination, they suffered\r\nthem to continue in a separate state, approaching to independence, if\r\nnot wholly independent.\r\n\r\nThe Mahomedans, during the period of the Arabs, never expelled or\r\ndestroyed the native Gentoo nobility, zemindars, or landholders of the\r\ncountry. They all, or almost all, remained fixed in their places,\r\nproperties, and dignities; and the shadows of several of them remain\r\nunder our jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nThe next, which is the third era, is an era the more necessary to\r\nobserve upon, because Mr. Hastings has made many applications to it in\r\nhis defence before the Commons: namely, the invasion of the Tartars, or\r\nthe era of Tamerlane. These Tartars did not establish themselves on the\r\nruins of the Hindoos. Their conquests were over the other Mahomedans:\r\nfor Tamerlane invaded Hindostan, as he invaded other countries, in the\r\ncharacter of the great reformer of the Mahomedan religion. He came as a\r\nsort of successor to the rights of the Prophet, upon a divine title. He\r\nstruck at all the Mahomedan princes who reigned at that time. He\r\nconsidered them as apostates, or at least as degenerated from the faith,\r\nand as tyrants abusing their power. To facilitate his conquests over\r\nthese, he was often obliged to come to a sort of a composition with the\r\npeople of the country he invaded. Tamerlane had neither time nor means\r\nnor inclination to dispossess the ancient rajahs of the country.\r\n\r\nYour Lordships will observe that I propose nothing more than to give you\r\nan idea of the principles of policy which prevailed in these several\r\nrevolutions, and not an history of the furious military achievements of\r\na barbarous invader. Historians, indeed, are generally very liberal of\r\ntheir information concerning everything but what we ought to be very\r\nanxious to know. They tell us that India was conquered by Tamerlane, and\r\nconquered in such a year. The year will be found to coincide somewhere,\r\nI believe, with the end of the fourteenth century. Thinking the mere\r\nfact as of little moment, and its chronology as nothing, but thinking\r\nthe policy very material, which, indeed, is to be collected only here\r\nand there, in various books written with various views, I shall beg\r\nleave to lay before you a very remarkable circumstance relative to that\r\npolicy, and taken from the same book to which I formerly referred, Mr.\r\nHolwell's.\r\n\r\n\"When the Hindoo rajahs, or princes of Hindostan, submitted to\r\nTamerlane, it was on these capital stipulations: that the emperor should\r\nmarry a daughter of Rajah Cheyt Sing's house; that the head of this\r\nhouse should be in perpetuity governors of the citadel of Agra, and\r\nanoint the king at his coronation; and that the emperors should never\r\nimpose the _jessera_ (or poll-tax) upon the Hindoos.\"\r\n\r\nHere was a conqueror, as he is called, coming in upon terms; mixing his\r\nblood with that of the native nobility of the country he conquered, and,\r\nin consequence of this mixture, placing them in succession upon the\r\nthrone of the country he subdued; making one of them even hereditary\r\nconstable of the capital of his kingdom, and thereby putting his\r\nposterity as a pledge into their hands. What is full as remarkable, he\r\nfreed the Hindoos forever from that tax which the Mahomedans have laid\r\nupon every country over which the sword of Mahomet prevailed,--namely, a\r\ncapitation tax upon all who do not profess the religion of the\r\nMahomedans. But the Hindoos, by express charter, were exempted from that\r\nmark of servitude, and thereby declared not to be a conquered people.\r\nThe native princes, in all their transactions with the Mogul government,\r\ncarried the evident marks of this free condition in a noble independency\r\nof spirit. Within their own districts the authority of many of them\r\nseemed entire. We are often led into mistakes concerning the government\r\nof Hindostan, by comparing it with those governments where the prince is\r\narmed with a full, speculative, entire authority, and where the great\r\npeople have, with great titles, no privileges at all, or, having\r\nprivileges, have those privileges only as subjects. But in Hindostan the\r\nmodes, the degrees, the circumstances of subjection varied infinitely.\r\nIn some places hardly a trace at all of subjection was to be discerned;\r\nin some the rajahs were almost assessors of the throne, as in this case\r\nof the Rajah Cheyt Sing. These circumstances mark, that Tamerlane,\r\nhowever he may be indicated by the odious names of Tartar and Conqueror,\r\nwas no barbarian; that the people who submitted to him did not submit\r\nwith the abject submission of slaves to the sword of a conqueror, but\r\nadmitted a great supreme emperor, who was just, prudent, and politic,\r\ninstead of the ferocious, oppressive, lesser Mahomedan sovereigns, who\r\nhad before forced their way by the sword into the country.\r\n\r\nThat country resembled more a republic of princes with a great chief at\r\ntheir head than a territory in absolute, uniform, systematic subjection\r\nfrom one end to the other,--in which light Mr. Hastings and others of\r\nlate have thought proper to consider it. According to them, if a\r\nsubordinate prince, like Cheyt Sing, was not ready to pay any exorbitant\r\nsum on instant demand, or submit to any extent of fine which should be\r\ninflicted upon him by the mere will of the person who called _robbery_ a\r\n_fine_, and who took the measure of that fine without either considering\r\nthe means of paying or the degree of delinquency that justified it,\r\ntheir properties, liberties, and lives were instantly forfeited. The\r\nrajahs of that country were armed; they had fortresses for their\r\nsecurity; they had troops. In the receipt of both their own and the\r\nimperial revenue, their securities for justice were in their own hands:\r\nbut the policy of the Mogul princes very rarely led them to push that\r\npeople to such extremity as it is supposed that on every slight occasion\r\nwe have a right to push those who are the subjects of our pretended\r\nconquest.\r\n\r\nMr. Holwell throws much light on this policy, which became the standing\r\nlaw of the empire.\r\n\r\nIn the unfortunate wars which followed the death of Mauz-o-Din, \"Sevajee\r\nCheyt Sing,\" (the great rajah we have just mentioned,) \"with a select\r\nbody of Rajpoots, by a well-conducted retreat recovered Agra, and was\r\nsoon after reconciled to the king [the Mogul] and admitted to his\r\nfavor,--conformable to the steady policy of this government, in keeping\r\na good understanding with the principal rajahs, and more especially with\r\nthe head of this house, who is ever capable of raising and fomenting a\r\nvery formidable party upon any intended revolution in this despotic and\r\nprecarious monarchy.\"\r\n\r\nYou see that it was the monarchy that was precarious, not the rights of\r\nthe subordinate chiefs. Your Lordships see, that, notwithstanding our\r\nideas of Oriental despotism, under the successors of Tamerlane, these\r\nprincipal rajahs, instead of being called wretches, and treated as such,\r\nas Mr. Hastings has thought it becoming to call and treat them, when\r\nthey were in arms against their sovereign, were regarded with respect,\r\nand were admitted to easy reconciliations; because, in reality, in their\r\noccasional hostilities, they were not properly rebellious subjects, but\r\nprinces often asserting their natural rights and the just constitution\r\nof the country.\r\n\r\nThis view of the policy which prevailed during the dynasty of Tamerlane\r\nnaturally conducts me to the next, which is the fourth era in this\r\nhistory: I mean the era of the Emperor Akbar. He was the first of the\r\nsuccessors of Tamerlane who obtained possession of Bengal. It is easy to\r\nshow of what nature his conquest was. It was over the last Mahomedan\r\ndynasty. He, too, like his predecessor, Tamerlane, conquered the prince,\r\nnot the country. It is a certain mark that it was not a conquered\r\ncountry in the sense in which we commonly call a country conquered, that\r\nthe natives, great men and landholders, continued in every part in the\r\npossession of their estates, and of the jurisdictions annexed to them.\r\nIt is true, that, in the several wars for the succession to the Mogul\r\nempire, and in other of their internal wars, severe revenges were taken,\r\nwhich bore resemblance to those taken in the wars of the Roses in this\r\ncountry, where it was the common course, in the heat of blood,--\"Off\r\nwith his head!--so much for Buckingham!\" Yet, where the country again\r\nrecovered its form and settlement, it recovered the spirit of a mild\r\ngovernment. Whatever rigor was used with regard to the Mahomedan\r\nadventurers from Persia, Turkey, and other parts, who filled the places\r\nof servile grandeur in the Mogul court, the Hindoos were a favored,\r\nprotected, gently treated people.\r\n\r\nThe next, which is the fifth era, is a troubled and vexatious\r\nperiod,--the era of the independent Subahs of Bengal. Five of these\r\nsubahs, or viceroys, governed from about the year 1717, or thereabouts.\r\nThey grew into independence partly by the calamities and concussions of\r\nthat empire, which happened during the disputes for the succession of\r\nTamerlane, and partly, and indeed principally, by the great shook which\r\nthe empire received when Thamas Kouli Khân broke into that country,\r\ncarried off its revenues, overturned the throne, and massacred not only\r\nmany of the chief nobility, but almost all the inhabitants of the\r\ncapital city. This rude shock, which that empire was never able to\r\nrecover, enabled the viceroys to become independent; but their\r\nindependence led to their ruin. Those who had usurped upon their masters\r\nhad servants who usurped upon them. Aliverdy Khân murdered his master,\r\nand opened a way into Bengal for a body of foreign invaders, the\r\nMahrattas, who cruelly harassed the country for several years. Their\r\nretreat was at length purchased, and by a sum which is supposed to\r\namount to five millions sterling. By this purchase he secured the\r\nexhausted remains of an exhausted kingdom, and left it to his grandson,\r\nSurajah Dowlah, in peace and poverty. On the fall of Surajah Dowlah, in\r\n1756, commenced the last, which is the sixth,--the era of the British\r\nempire.\r\n\r\nOn the fifth dynasty I have only to remark to your Lordships, that at\r\nits close the Hindoo chiefs were almost everywhere found in possession\r\nof the country; that, although Aliverdy Khân was a cruel tyrant, though\r\nhe was an untitled usurper, though he racked and tormented the people\r\nunder his government, urged, however, by an apparent necessity from an\r\ninvading army of one hundred thousand horse in his dominions,--yet,\r\nunder him, the rajahs still preserved their rank, their dignity, their\r\ncastles, their houses, their seigniories, all the insignia of their\r\nsituation, and always the right, sometimes also the means, of protecting\r\ntheir subordinate people, till the last and unfortunate era of 1756.\r\n\r\nThrough the whole of this sketch of history I wish to impress but one\r\ngreat and important truth upon your minds: namely, that, through all\r\nthese revolutions in government and changes in power, an Hindoo polity,\r\nand the spirit of an Hindoo government, did more or less exist in that\r\nprovince with which he was concerned, until it was finally to be\r\ndestroyed by Mr. Hastings.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy Lords, I have gone through all the eras precedent to those of the\r\nBritish power in India, and am come to the first of those eras. Mr.\r\nHastings existed in India, and was a servant of the Company before that\r\nera, and had his education between both. He is an antediluvian with\r\nregard to the British dominion in Bengal. He was coexistent with all the\r\nacts and monuments of that revolution, and had no small share in all the\r\nabuses of that abusive period which preceded his actual government. Bat\r\nas it was during that transit from Eastern to Western power that most of\r\nthe abuses had their origin, it will not be perfectly easy for your\r\nLordships thoroughly to enter into the nature and circumstances of them\r\nwithout an explanation of the principal events that happened from the\r\nyear 1756 until the commencement of Mr. Hastings's government,--during a\r\ngood part of which time we do not often lose sight of him. If I find it\r\nagreeable to your Lordships, if I find that you wish to know these\r\nannals of Indian suffering and British delinquency, if you desire that I\r\nshould unfold the series of the transactions from 1756 to the period of\r\nMr. Hastings's government in 1771, that you may know how far he promoted\r\nwhat was good, how far he rectified what was evil, how far he abstained\r\nfrom innovation in tyranny, and contented himself with the old stock of\r\nabuse, your Lordships will have the goodness to consult the strength\r\nwhich from late indisposition, begins almost to fail me. And if you\r\nthink the explanation is not time lost in this new world and in this new\r\nbusiness, I shall venture to sketch out, as briefly and with as much\r\nperspicuity as I can give them, the leading events of that obscure and\r\nperplexed period which intervened between the British settlement in 1757\r\nand Mr. Hastings's government. If I should be so happy as to succeed in\r\nthat attempt, your Lordships' minds will be prepared for hearing this\r\ncause. Then your Lordships will have a clear view of the origin and\r\nnature of the abuses which prevailed in that government before Mr.\r\nHastings obtained his greatest power, and since that time; and then we\r\nshall be able to enter fully and explicitly into the nature of the\r\ncause: and I should hope that it will pave the way and make everything\r\neasy for your subsequent justice.\r\n\r\nI therefore wish to stop at this period, in which Mr. Hastings became\r\nactive in the service, pretty near the time when he began his political\r\ncareer: and here, my Lords, I pause, wishing your indulgence at such\r\ntime as will suit your convenience for pursuing the rest of this\r\neventful history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH\r\n\r\nIN\r\n\r\nOPENING THE IMPEACHMENT.\r\n\r\nSECOND DAY: SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 16, 1788.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Lords,--In what I had the honor of laying before your Lordships\r\nyesterday, and in what I may further trouble you with to-day, I wish to\r\nobserve a distinction, which if I did not lay down so perfectly as I\r\nought, I hope I shall now be able to mark it out with sufficient\r\nexactness and perspicuity.\r\n\r\nFirst, I beg leave to observe that what I shall think necessary to\r\nstate, as matter of preliminary explanation, in order to give your\r\nLordships a true idea of the scene of action, of the instruments which\r\nMr. Hastings employed, and the effects which they produced,--all this I\r\nwish to be distinguished from matter brought to criminate. Even the\r\nmatter, as stated by me, which may be hereafter brought to criminate, so\r\nfar as it falls to my share at present, is only to be considered, in\r\nthis stage of the business, as merely illustrative. Your Lordships are\r\nto expect, as undoubtedly you will require, substantial matter of\r\ncrimination to be laid open for that purpose at the moment when the\r\nevidence to each charge is ready to be produced to you. Thus your\r\nLordships will easily separate historical illustration from criminal\r\nopening. For instance, if I stated yesterday to your Lordships, as I\r\ndid, the tyranny and cruelty of one of the usurping viceroys, whose\r\nusurpation and whose vices led the way to the destruction of his country\r\nand the introduction of a foreign power, I do not mean to charge Mr.\r\nHastings with any part of that guilt: what bears upon Mr. Hastings is\r\nhis having avowedly looked to such a tyrant and such a usurper as his\r\nmodel, and followed that pernicious example with a servile fidelity.\r\nWhen I have endeavored to lay open to your Lordships anything abusive,\r\nor leading to abuse, from defects or errors in the constitution of the\r\nCompany's service, I did not mean to criminate Mr. Hastings on any part\r\nof those defects and errors: I state them to show that he took advantage\r\nof the imperfections of the institution to lot in his abuse of the power\r\nwith which he was intrusted. If, for a further instance, I have stated\r\nthat in general the service of the India Company was insufficient in\r\nlegal pay or emolument and abundant in the means of illegal profit, I do\r\nnot state that defect as owing to Mr. Hastings; but I state it as a\r\nfact, to show in what manner and on what pretences he did, fraudulently,\r\ncorruptly, and for the purposes of his own ambition, take advantage of\r\nthat defect, and, under color of reformation, make an illegal, partial,\r\ncorrupt rise of emoluments to certain favored persons without regard to\r\nthe interests of the service at large,--increasing rather than lessening\r\nthe means of illicit emolument, as well as loading the Company with many\r\nheavy and ruinous expenses in avowed salaries and allowances.\r\n\r\nHaving requested your Lordships to keep in mind, which I trust you would\r\ndo even without my taking the liberty of suggesting it to you, these\r\nnecessary distinctions, I shall revert to the period at which I closed\r\nyesterday, that great and memorable period which has remotely given\r\noccasion to the trial of this day.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy Lords, to obtain empire is common; to govern it well has been rare\r\nindeed. To chastise the guilt of those who have been instruments of\r\nimperial sway over other nations by the high superintending justice of\r\nthe sovereign state has not many striking examples among any people.\r\nHitherto we have not furnished our contingent to the records of honor.\r\nWe have been confounded with the herd of conquerors. Our dominion has\r\nbeen a vulgar thing. But we begin to emerge; and I hope that a severe\r\ninspection of ourselves, a purification of our own offences, a\r\nlustration of the exorbitances of our own power, is a glory reserved to\r\nthis time, to this nation, and to this august tribunal.\r\n\r\nThe year 1756 is a memorable era in the history of the world: it\r\nintroduced a new nation from the remotest verge of the Western world,\r\nwith new manners, new customs, new institutions, new opinions, new laws,\r\ninto the heart of Asia.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, if, in that part of Asia whose native regular government was\r\nthen broken up,--if, at the moment when it had fallen into darkness and\r\nconfusion from having become the prey and almost the sport of the\r\nambition of its home-born grandees,--if, in that gloomy season, a star\r\nhad risen from the West, that would prognosticate a better generation,\r\nand would shed down the sweet influences of order, peace, science, and\r\nsecurity to the natives of that vexed and harassed country, we should\r\nhave been covered with genuine honor. It would have been a beautiful and\r\nnoble spectacle to mankind.\r\n\r\nIndeed, something might have been expected of the kind, when a new\r\ndominion emanated from a learned and enlightened part of the world in\r\nthe most enlightened period of its existence. Still more might it have\r\nbeen expected, when that dominion was found to issue from the bosom of a\r\nfree country, that it would have carried with it the full benefit of the\r\nvital principle of the British liberty and Constitution, though its\r\nmunicipal forms were not communicable, or at least the advantage of the\r\nliberty and spirit of the British Constitution. Had this been the case,\r\n(alas! it was not,) you would have been saved the trouble of this day.\r\nIt might have been expected, too, that, in that enlightened state of the\r\nworld, influenced by the best religion, and from an improved description\r\nof that best religion, (I mean the Christian reformed religion,) that we\r\nshould have done honor to Europe, to letters, to laws, to\r\nreligion,--done honor to all the circumstances of which in this island\r\nwe boast ourselves, at the great and critical moment of that revolution.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, it has happened otherwise. It is now left for us to repair our\r\nformer errors. Resuming the history where I broke off yesterday by your\r\nindulgence to my weakness,--Surajah Dowlah was the adopted grandson of\r\nAliverdy Khân, a cruel and ferocious tyrant, the manner of whose\r\nacquisition of power I have already stated. He came too young and\r\nunexperienced to that throne of usurpation. It was a usurpation yet\r\ngreen in the country, and the country felt uneasy under it. It had not\r\nthe advantage of that prescriptive usage, that inveterate habit, that\r\ntraditionary opinion, which a long continuance of any system of\r\ngovernment secures to it. The only real security which Surajah Dowlah's\r\ngovernment could possess was the security of an army. But the great aim\r\nof this prince and his predecessor was to supply the weakness of his\r\ngovernment by the strength of his purse; he therefore amassed treasures\r\nby all ways and on all hands. But as the Indian princes, in general, are\r\nas unwisely tenacious of their treasure as they are rapacious in getting\r\nit, the more money he amassed, the more he felt the effects of poverty.\r\nThe consequence was, that their armies were unpaid, and, being unpaid or\r\nirregularly paid, were undisciplined, disorderly, unfaithful. In this\r\nsituation, a young prince, confiding more in the appearances than\r\nexamining into the reality of things, undertook (from motives which the\r\nHouse of Commons, with all their industry to discover the circumstances,\r\nhave found it difficult to make out) to attack a little miserable\r\ntrading fort that we had erected at Calcutta. He succeeded in that\r\nattempt only because success in that attempt was easy. A close\r\nimprisonment of the whole settlement followed,--not owing, I believe, to\r\nthe direct will of the prince, but, what will always happen when the\r\nwill of the prince is but too much the law, to a gross abuse of his\r\npower by his lowest servants,--by which one hundred and twenty or more\r\nof our countrymen perished miserably in a dungeon, by a fate too\r\ntragical for me to be desirous to relate, and too well known to stand in\r\nneed of it.\r\n\r\nAt the time that this event happened, there was at the same time a\r\nconcurrence of other events, which, from this partial and momentary\r\nweakness, displayed the strength of Great Britain in Asia. For some\r\nyears before, the French and English troops began, on the coast of\r\nCoromandel, to exhibit the power, force, and efficacy of European\r\ndiscipline. As we daily looked for a war with France, our settlements on\r\nthat coast were in some degree armed. Lord Pigot, then Governor of\r\nMadras,--Lord Pigot, the preserver and the victim of the British\r\ndominion in Asia,--detached such of the Company's force as could he\r\ncollected and spared, and such of his Majesty's ships as were on that\r\nstation, to the assistance of Calcutta. And--to hasten this history to\r\nits conclusion--the daring and commanding genius of Clive, the patient\r\nand firm ability of Watson, the treachery of Mir Jaffier, and the battle\r\nof Plassey gave us at once the patronage of a kingdom and the command of\r\nall its treasures. We negotiated with Mir Jaffier for the viceroyal\r\nthrone of his master. On that throne we seated him. And we obtained, on\r\nour part, immense sums of money. We obtained a million sterling for the\r\nCompany, upwards of a million for individuals, in the whole a sum of\r\nabout two millions two hundred and thirty thousand pounds for various\r\npurposes, from the prince whom we had set up. We obtained, too, the town\r\nof Calcutta more completely than we had before possessed it, and the\r\ntwenty-four districts adjoining. This was the first small seminal\r\nprinciple of the immense territorial acquisitions we have since made in\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\nMany circumstances of this acquisition I pass by. There is a sacred veil\r\nto be drawn over the beginnings of all governments. Ours in India had an\r\norigin like those which time has sanctified by obscurity. Time, in the\r\norigin of most governments, has thrown this mysterious veil over them;\r\nprudence and discretion make it necessary to throw something of the same\r\ndrapery over more recent foundations, in which otherwise the fortune,\r\nthe genius, the talents, and military virtue of this nation never shone\r\nmore conspicuously. But whatever necessity might hide or excuse or\r\npalliate, in the acquisition of power, a wise nation, when it has once\r\nmade a revolution upon its own principles and for its own ends, rests\r\nthere. The first step to empire is revolution, by which power is\r\nconferred; the next is good laws, good order, good institutions, to give\r\nthat power stability. I am sorry to say that the reverse of this policy\r\nwas the principle on which the gentlemen in India acted. It was such as\r\ntended to make the new government as unstable as the old. By the vast\r\nsums of money acquired by individuals upon this occasion, by the immense\r\nsudden prodigies of fortune, it was discovered that a revolution in\r\nBengal was a mine much more easily worked and infinitely more productive\r\nthan the mines of Potosi and Mexico. It was found that the work was not\r\nonly very lucrative, but not at all difficult. Where Clive forded a deep\r\nwater upon an unknown bottom, he left a bridge for his successors, over\r\nwhich the lame could hobble and the blind might grope their way. There\r\nwas not at that time a knot of clerks in a counting-house, there was not\r\na captain of a band of ragged _topasses_, that looked for anything less\r\nthan the deposition of subahs and the sale of kingdoms. Accordingly,\r\nthis revolution, which ought to have precluded other revolutions,\r\nunfortunately became fruitful of them; and when Lord Clive returned to\r\nEurope, to enjoy his fame and fortune in his own country, there arose\r\nanother description of men, who thought that a revolution might be made\r\nupon his revolution, and as lucrative to them as his was to the first\r\nprojectors. Scarcely was Mir Jaffier, Lord Olive's nabob, seated on his\r\n_musnud_, than they immediately, or in a short time, projected another\r\nrevolution, a revolution which was to unsettle all the former had\r\nsettled, a revolution to make way for new disturbances and new wars, and\r\nwhich led to that long chain of peculation which ever since has\r\nafflicted and oppressed Bengal.\r\n\r\nIf ever there was a time when Bengal should have had respite from\r\ninternal revolutions, it was this. The governor forced upon the natives\r\nwas now upon the throne. All the great lords of the country, both\r\nGentoos and Mahomedans, were uneasy, discontented, and disobedient, and\r\nsome absolutely in arms, and refusing to recognize the prince we had set\r\nup. An imminent invasion of the Mahrattas, an actual invasion headed by\r\nthe son of the Mogul, the revenues on account of the late shock very ill\r\ncollected even where the country was in some apparent quiet, an hungry\r\ntreasury at Calcutta, an empty treasury at Moorshedabad,--everything\r\ndemanded tranquillity, and with it order and economy. In this situation\r\nit was resolved to make a new and entirely mercenary revolution, and to\r\nset up to sale the government, secured to its present possessor by every\r\ntie of public faith and every sacred obligation which could bind or\r\ninfluence mankind. This second revolution forms that period in the\r\nBengal history which had the most direct influence upon all the\r\nsubsequent transactions. It introduces some of the persons who were most\r\nactive in the succeeding scenes, and from that time to this has given\r\nits tone and character to the British affairs and government. It marks\r\nand specifies the origin and true principle of all the abuses which Mr.\r\nHastings was afterwards appointed to correct, and which the Commons\r\ncharge that he continued and aggravated: namely, the venal depositions\r\nand venal exaltations of the country powers; the taking of bribes and\r\ncorrupt presents from all parties in those changes; the vitiating and\r\nmaiming the Company's records; the suppression of public correspondence;\r\ncorrupt combinations and conspiracies; perfidy in negotiation\r\nestablished into principle; acts of the most atrocious wickedness\r\njustified upon purity of intention; mock-trials and collusive acquittals\r\namong the parties in common guilt; and in the end, the Court of\r\nDirectors supporting the scandalous breach of their own orders. I shall\r\nstate the particulars of this second revolution more at large.\r\n\r\nSoon after the revolution which had seated Mir Jaffier on the viceroyal\r\nthrone, the spirit of the Mogul empire began, as it were, to make one\r\nfaint struggle before it finally expired. The then heir to that throne,\r\nescaping from the hands of those who had held his father prisoner, had\r\nput himself at the head of several chiefs collected under the standard\r\nof his house, and appeared in force on the frontiers of the provinces of\r\nBengal and Bahar, upon both which he made some impression. This alarmed\r\nthe new powers, the Nabob Mir Jaffier, and the Presidency of Calcutta;\r\nand as in a common cause, and by the terms of their mutual alliance,\r\nthey took the field against him. The Nabob's eldest son and\r\nheir-apparent commanded in chief. Major Calliaud commanded the English\r\nforces under the government of Calcutta. Mr. Holwell was in the\r\ntemporary possession of the Presidency. Mr. Vansittart was hourly\r\nexpected to supersede him. Mr. Warren Hastings, a young gentleman about\r\ntwenty-seven years of age, was Resident for the Company at the durbar,\r\nor court, of Mir Jaffier, our new-created Nabob of Bengal, allied to\r\nthis country by the most solemn treaties that can bind men; for which\r\ntreaties he had paid, and was then paying, immense sums of money. Mr.\r\nWarren Hastings was the pledge in his hands for the honor of the British\r\nnation, and their fidelity to their engagements.\r\n\r\nIn this situation, Mr. Holwell, whom the terrible example of the Black\r\nHole at Calcutta had not cured of ambition, thought an hour was not to\r\nbe lost in accomplishing a revolution and selling the reigning Nabob.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, there was in the house of Mir Jaffier, in his court, and in\r\nhis family, a man of an intriguing, crafty, subtle, and at the same time\r\nbold, daring, desperate, bloody, and ferocious character, called Cossim\r\nAli Khân. He was the son-in-law of Mir Jaffier; and he made no other use\r\nof this affinity than to find some means to dethrone and to murder him.\r\nThis was the person in whose school of politics Mr. Hastings made his\r\nfirst studies, and whose conduct he quotes as his example, and for whose\r\nfriends, agents, and favorites he has always shown a marked\r\npredilection. This dangerous man was not long without finding persons\r\nwho observed his talents with admiration, and who thought fit to employ\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe Council at Calcutta was divided into two departments: one, the\r\nCouncil in general; the other a Select Committee, which they had\r\narranged for the better carrying on their political affairs. But the\r\nSelect Committee had no power of acting wholly without the Council at\r\nlarge,--at least, finally and conclusively. The Select Committee\r\nthought otherwise. Between these litigant parties for power I shall not\r\ndetermine on the merits,--thinking of nothing but the use that was made\r\nof the power, to whomsoever it belonged. This Secret Committee, then,\r\nwithout communicating with the rest of the Council, formed the plan for\r\na second revolution. But the concurrence of Major Calliaud, who\r\ncommanded the British troops, was essential to the purpose, as it could\r\nnot be accomplished without force. Mr. Hastings's assistance was\r\nnecessary, as it could not be accomplished without treachery.\r\n\r\nThese are the parties concerned in the intended revolution. Mr. Holwell,\r\nwho considered himself in possession only of temporary power, was urged\r\nto precipitate the business; for if Mr. Vansittart should arrive before\r\nhis plot could be finally put into execution, he would have all the\r\nleading advantages of it, and Mr. Holwell would be considered only as a\r\nsecondary instrument. But whilst Mr. Holwell, who originally conceived\r\nthis plot, urged forward the execution of it, in order that the chief\r\nshare of the profits might fall to him, the Major, and possibly the\r\nResident, held back, till they might receive the sanction of the\r\npermanent governor, who was hourly expected, with whom one of them was\r\nconnected, and who was to carry with him the whole weight of the\r\nauthority of this kingdom. This difference produced discussions. Holwell\r\nendeavored by his correspondence to stimulate Calliaud to this\r\nenterprise, which without him could not be undertaken at all. But Major\r\nCalliaud had different views. He concurred inwardly, as he tells us\r\nhimself, in all the principles of this intended revolution, in the\r\npropriety and necessity of it. He only wished delay. But he gave such\r\npowerful, solid, and satisfactory reasons, not against the delay, but\r\nthe very merits of the design itself, exposing the injustice and the\r\ndanger of it, and the impossibility of mending by it their condition in\r\nany respect, as must have damned it in the minds of all rational men: at\r\nleast it ought to have damned it forever in his own. But you will see\r\nthat Holwell persevered in his plan, and that Major Calliaud thought two\r\nthings necessary: first, not wholly to destroy the scheme, which he\r\ntells us he always approved, but to postpone the execution,--and in the\r\nmean time to delude the Nabob by the most strong, direct, and sanguine\r\nassurances of friendship and protection that it was possible to give to\r\nman.\r\n\r\nWhilst the projected revolution stood suspended,--whilst Mr. Holwell\r\nurged it forward, and Mr. Vansittart was expected every day to give it\r\neffect,--whilst Major Calliaud, with this design of ruining the Nabob\r\nlodged in his breast, suspended in execution, and condemned in\r\nprinciple, kept the fairest face and the most confidential interviews\r\nwith that unfortunate prince and his son,--as the operations of the\r\ncampaign relaxed, the army drew near to Moorshedabad, the capital, when\r\na truly extraordinary scene happened, such I am sure the English annals\r\nbefore that time had furnished no example of, nor will, I trust, in\r\nfuture. I shall state it as one piece from beginning to end, reserving\r\nthe events which intervened; because, as I do not produce any part of\r\nthis series for the gratification of historical curiosity, the\r\ncon-texture is necessary to demonstrate to your Lordships the spirit of\r\nour Bengal politics, and the necessity of some other sort of judicial\r\ninquiries than those which that government institute for themselves.\r\nThe transaction so manifestly marks the character of the whole\r\nproceeding that I hope I shall not be blamed for suspending for a moment\r\nthe narrative of the steps taken towards the revolution, that you may\r\nsee the whole of this episode together,--that by it you may judge of the\r\ncauses which led progressively to the state in which the Company's\r\naffairs stood, when Mr. Hastings was sent for the express purpose of\r\nreforming it.\r\n\r\nThe business I am going to enter into is commonly known by the name of\r\nthe Story of the Three Seals. It is to be found in the Appendix, No. 10,\r\nto the First Report of the state and condition of the East India\r\nCompany, made in 1773. The word _Report_, my Lords, is sometimes a\r\nlittle equivocal, and may signify sometimes, not what is made known, but\r\nwhat remains in obscurity: the detail and evidence of many facts\r\nreferred to in the Report being usually thrown into the Appendix. Many\r\npeople, and I among the rest, (I take shame to myself for it,) may not\r\nhave fully examined that Appendix. I was not a member of either of the\r\nIndia committees of 1773. It is not, indeed, till within this year that\r\nI have been thoroughly acquainted with that memorable history of the\r\nThree Seals.\r\n\r\nThe history is this. In the year 1760 the allies were in the course of\r\noperations against the son of the Mogul, now the present Mogul, who, as\r\nI have already stated, had made an irruption into the kingdom of Bahar,\r\nin order to reduce the lower provinces to his obedience. The parties\r\nopposing him were the Nabob of Bengal and the Company's troops under\r\nMajor Calliaud. It was whilst they faced the common enemy as one body,\r\nthis negotiation for the destruction of the Nabob of Bengal by his\r\nfaithful allies of the Company was going on with diligence. At that time\r\nthe Nabob's son, Meeran, a youth in the flower of his age, bold,\r\nvigorous, active, full of the politics in which those who are versed in\r\nusurpation are never wanting, commanded the army under his father, but\r\nwas in reality the efficient person in all things.\r\n\r\nAbout the 15th of April, 1760, as I have it from Major Calliaud's letter\r\nof that date, the Nabob came into his tent, and, with looks of the\r\nutmost embarrassment, big with some design which swelled his bosom,\r\nsomething that was too large and burdensome to conceal, and yet too\r\ncritical to be told, appeared to be in a state of great distraction. The\r\nMajor, seeing him in this condition, kindly, gently, like a fast and\r\nsure friend, employed (to use his own expression) _some of those\r\nassurances that tend to make men fully open their hearts_; and\r\naccordingly, fortified by his assurances, and willing to disburden\r\nhimself of the secret that oppressed him, he opens his heart to the\r\ncommanding officer of his new friends, allies, and protectors. The\r\nNabob, thus assured, did open himself, and informed Major Calliaud that\r\nhe had just received a message from the Prince, or his principal\r\nminister, informing him that the Prince Royal, now the Mogul, had an\r\nintention (as, indeed, he rationally might, supposing that we were as\r\nwell disposed to him as we showed ourselves afterwards) to surrender\r\nhimself into the hands of him, the Nabob, but at the same time wished,\r\nas a guaranty, that the commander-in-chief of the English forces should\r\ngive him security for his life and his honor, when he should in that\r\nmanner surrender himself to the Nabob. I do not mean, my Lords, by\r\nsurrendering, that it was supposed he intended to surrender himself\r\nprisoner of war, but as a sovereign dubious of the fidelity of those\r\nabout him would put himself into the hands of his faithful subjects, of\r\nthose who claimed to derive all their power, as both we and the Nabob\r\ndid, under his authority. The Nabob stated to the English general, that\r\nwithout this English security the Prince would not deliver himself into\r\nhis hands. Here he confessed he found a difficulty. For the giving this\r\nfaith, if it were kept, would defeat his ultimate view, which was, when\r\nthe Prince had delivered himself into his hands, in plain terms to\r\nmurder him. This grand act could not be accomplished without the English\r\ngeneral. In the first place, the Prince, without the English security,\r\nwould not deliver himself into the Nabob's hands; and afterwards,\r\nwithout the English concurrence, he could not be murdered. These were\r\ndifficulties that pressed upon the mind of the Nabob.\r\n\r\nThe English commander heard this astonishing proposition without any\r\napparent emotion. Being a man habituated to great affairs, versed in\r\nrevolutions, and with a mind fortified against extraordinary events, he\r\nheard it and answered it without showing any signs of abhorrence or\r\ndetestation,--at the same time with a protestation that he would indeed\r\nserve him, the Nabob, but it should be upon such terms as honor and\r\njustice could support: informing him, that an assurance for the Prince's\r\nsafety could not be given by him, until he had consulted Mr. Holwell,\r\nwho was Governor, and his superior.\r\n\r\nThis conversation passed in the morning. On that very morning, and\r\nwhilst the transaction was hot, Major Calliaud writes to Mr. Holwell an\r\naccount of it. In his letter he informs him that he made an inquiry,\r\nwithout stating from whom, but that he did inquire the probability of\r\nthe Nabob's getting possession of the Prince from some persons, who\r\nassured him that there was no probability of the Prince's intention to\r\ndeliver himself to the Nabob on any terms. Be that as it may, it is\r\nimpossible not to remark that the whole transaction of the morning of\r\nthe 15th of April was not very discouraging to the Nabob,--not such as\r\nwould induce him to consider this most detestable of all projects as a\r\nthing utterly unfeasible, and as such to abandon it. The evening came on\r\nwithout anything to alter his opinion. Major Calliaud that evening came\r\nto the Nabob's tent to arrange some matters relative to the approaching\r\ncampaign. The business soon ended with regard to the campaign; but the\r\nproposal of the morning to Major Calliaud, as might be expected to\r\nhappen, was in effect renewed. Indeed, the form was a little different;\r\nbut the substantial part remained the same. Your Lordships will see what\r\nthese alterations were.\r\n\r\nIn the evening scene the persons were more numerous. On the part of the\r\nCompany, Major Calliaud, Mr. Lushington, Mr. Knox, and the ambassador at\r\nthe Nabob's court, Mr. Warren Hastings. On the part of the Moorish\r\ngovernment, the Nabob himself, his son Meeran, a Persian secretary, and\r\nthe Nabob's head spy, an officer well known in that part of the world,\r\nand of some rank. These were the persons of the drama in the evening\r\nscene. The Nabob and his son did not wait for the Prince's committing\r\nhimself to their faith, which, it seems, Major Calliaud did not think\r\nlikely to happen; so that one act of treachery is saved: but another\r\nopened of as extraordinary a nature. Intent and eager on the execution,\r\nand the more certain, of their design, they accepted the plan of a\r\nwicked wretch, principal servant of the then prime-minister to the\r\nMogul, or themselves suggested it to him. A person called Conery, dewan\r\nor principal steward to Camgar Khân, a great chief in the service of the\r\nShahzada, or Prince, (now the Great Mogul, the sovereign under whom the\r\nCompany holds their charter,) had, it seems, made a proposal to the\r\nNabob, that, if a considerable territory then held by his master was\r\nassured to him, and a reward of a lac of rupees (ten or twelve thousand,\r\npounds) secured to him, he would for that consideration deliver the\r\nPrince, the eldest son of the Mogul, alive into the hands of the Nabob;\r\nor if that could not be effected, he engaged to murder him for the same\r\nreward. But as the assassin could not rely on the Nabob and his son for\r\nhis reward for this meritorious action, and thought better of English\r\nhonor and fidelity in such delicate cases, he required that Major\r\nCalliaud should set his seal to the agreement. This proposition was made\r\nto an English commander: what discourse happened upon it is uncertain.\r\nMr. Hastings is stated by some evidence to have acted as interpreter in\r\nthis memorable congress. But Major Calliaud agreed to it without any\r\ndifficulty. Accordingly, an instrument was drawn, an indenture\r\ntripartite prepared by the Persian secretary, securing to the party the\r\nreward of this infamous, perfidious, murderous act. First, the Nabob put\r\nhis own seal to the murder. The Nabob's son, Meeran, affixed _his_ seal.\r\nA third seal, the most important of all, was yet wanting. A pause\r\nensued: Major Calliaud's seal was not at hand; but Mr. Lushington was\r\nsent near half a mile to bring it. It was brought at length; and the\r\ninstrument of blood and treachery was completely executed. Three seals\r\nwere set to it.\r\n\r\nThis business of the three seals, by some means not quite fully\r\nexplained, but (as suspected by the parties) by means of the information\r\nof Mr. Holwell, who soon after came home, was conveyed to the ears of\r\nthe Court of Directors. The Court of Directors wrote out, under date of\r\nthe 7th of October, 1761, within a little more than a year after this\r\nextraordinary transaction, to this effect:--that, in conjunction with\r\nthe Nabob, Major Calliaud had signed a paper offering a reward of a lac\r\nof rupees, or some such sum, to several black persons, for the\r\nassassination of the Shahzada, or Prince heir-apparent,--which paper was\r\noffered to the then Chief of Patna to sign, but which he refused on\r\naccount of the infamy of the measure. As it appeared in the same light\r\nto them, the Directors, they ordered a strict inquiry into it. The India\r\nCompany, who here did their duty with apparent manliness and vigor, were\r\nresolved, however, to do it with gentleness, and to proceed in a manner\r\nthat could not produce any serious mischief to the parties charged; for\r\nthey directed the commission of inquiry to the very clan and set of\r\npeople who, from a participation in their common offences, stood in awe\r\nof one another,--in effect, to the parties in the transaction. Without a\r\nprosecutor, without an impartial director of the inquiry, they left it\r\nsubstantially to those persons to try one another for their common acts.\r\n\r\nHere I come upon the principle which I wish most strongly to mark to\r\nyour Lordships: I mean collusive trials and collusive acquittals. When\r\nthis matter came to be examined, according to the orders of the Court,\r\nwhich was on the 4th of October, 1762, the Council consisted of Peter\r\nMaguire, Warren Hastings, and Hugh Watts. Mr. Hastings had by this time\r\naccomplished the business of Resident with the Nabob, and had taken the\r\nseat to which his seniority entitled him in Council. Here a difficulty\r\narose _in limine_. Mr. Hastings was represented to have acted as\r\ninterpreter in this business; he was therefore himself an object of the\r\ninquisition; he was doubtful as evidence; he was disqualified as a\r\njudge. It likewise appeared that there might be some objection to others\r\nwhose evidence was wanting, but who were themselves concerned in the\r\nguilt. Mr. Lushington's evidence would be useful, but there were two\r\ncircumstances rather unlucky. First, he had put the seal to the\r\ninstrument of murder; and, secondly, and what was most material, he had\r\nmade an affidavit at Patna, whilst the affair was green and recent, that\r\nhe had done so; and in the same affidavit had deposed that Warren\r\nHastings was interpreter in that transaction. Here were difficulties\r\nboth on him and Mr. Hastings. The question was, how to get Mr. Hastings,\r\nthe interpreter, out of his interpretation, and to put him upon the seat\r\nof judgment. It was effected, however, and the manner in which it was\r\neffected was something curious. Mr. Lushington, who by this time was got\r\ncompletely over, himself tells you that in conferences with Major\r\nCalliaud, and by arguments and reasons by him delivered, he was\r\npersuaded to unsay his swearing, and to declare that he believed that\r\nthe affidavit which he made at Patna, and while the transaction was\r\nrecent or nearly recent, must be a mistake: that he _believed_ (what is\r\namazing indeed for any belief) that not Mr. Hastings, but he himself,\r\ninterpreted. Mr. Lushington completely loses his own memory, and he\r\naccepts an offered, a given memory, a memory supplied to him by a party\r\nin the transaction. By this operation all difficulties are removed: Mr.\r\nHastings is at once put into the capacity of a judge. He is declared by\r\nMr. Lushington not to have been an interpreter in the transaction. After\r\nthis, Mr. Hastings is himself examined. Your Lordships will look at the\r\ntransaction at your leisure, and I think you will consider it as a\r\npattern for inquiries of this kind. Mr. Hastings is examined: he does\r\nnot recollect. His memory also fails on a business in which it is not\r\neasy to suppose a man could be doubtful,--whether he was present or not:\r\nhe thinks he was not there,--for that, if he had been there, and acted\r\nas interpreter, he could not have forgot it.\r\n\r\nI think it is pretty nearly as I state it: if I have fallen into any\r\nerror or inaccuracy, it is easily rectified; for here is the state of\r\nthe transaction given by the parties themselves. On this inaccurate\r\nmemory of Mr. Hastings, not venturing, however, to say positively that\r\nhe was not the interpreter, or that he was not present, he is discharged\r\nfrom being an accomplice,--he is removed from the bar, and leaps upon\r\nthe seat of justice. The court thus completed, Major Calliaud comes\r\nmanfully forward to make his defence. Mr. Lushington is taken off his\r\nback in the manner we have seen, and no one person remains but Captain\r\nKnox. Now, if Captain Knox was there and assenting, he is an accomplice\r\ntoo. Captain Knox asserts, that, at the consultation about the murder,\r\nhe said it was a pity to cut off so fine a young fellow in such a\r\nmanner,--meaning that fine young fellow the Prince, the descendant of\r\nTamerlane, the present reigning Mogul, from whom the Company derive\r\ntheir present charter. The purpose to be served by this declaration, if\r\nit had any purpose, was, that Captain Knox did not assent to the murder,\r\nand that therefore his evidence might be valid.\r\n\r\nThe defence set up by Major Calliaud was to this effect. He was\r\napprehensive, he said, that the Nabob was alarmed at the violent designs\r\nthat were formed against him by Mr. Holwell, and that therefore, to\r\nquiet his mind, (to quiet it by a proposition compounded of murder and\r\ntreason,--an odd kind of mind he had that was to be quieted by such\r\nmeans!)--but to quiet his mind, and to show that the English were\r\nwilling to go all lengths with him, to sell body and soul to him, he did\r\nput his seal to this extraordinary agreement, he put his seal to this\r\nwonderful paper. He likewise stated, that he was of opinion at the time\r\nthat nothing at all sinister could happen from it, that no such murder\r\nwas likely to take place, whatever might be the intention of the\r\nparties. In fact, he had very luckily said in a letter of his, written a\r\nday after the setting the seal, \"I think nothing will come of this\r\nmatter, but it is no harm to try.\" This experimental treachery, and\r\nthese essays of conditional murder, appeared to him good enough to make\r\na trial of; but at the same time he was afraid nothing would come of it.\r\nIn general, the whole gest of his defence comes to one point, in which\r\nhe persists,--that, whatever the act might be, his mind is clear: \"My\r\nhands are guilty, but my heart is free.\" He conceived that it would be\r\nvery improper, undoubtedly, to do such an act, if he suspected anything\r\ncould happen from it: he, however, let the thing out of his own hands;\r\nhe put, it into the hands of others; he put the commission into the\r\nhands of a murderer. The fact was not denied; it was fully before these\r\nsevere judges. The extenuation was the purity of his heart, and the bad\r\nsituation of the Company's affairs,--the perpetual plea, which your\r\nLordships will hear of forever, and which if it will justify evil\r\nactions, they will take good care that the most nefarious of their deeds\r\nshall never want a sufficient justification. But then he calls upon his\r\nlife and his character to oppose to his seal; and though he has declared\r\nthat Mr. Holwell had intended ill to the Nabob, and that he approved of\r\nthose measures, and only postponed them, yet he thought it necessary, he\r\nsays, to quiet the fears of the Nabob; and from this motive he did an\r\nact abhorrent to his nature, and which, he says, he expressed his\r\nabhorrence of the morning after he signed it: not that he did so; but if\r\nhe had, I believe it would only have made the thing so many degrees\r\nworse. Your Lordships will observe, that, in this conference, as stated\r\nby himself, these reasons and apologies for it did not appear, nor did\r\nthey appear in the letter, nor anywhere else, till next year, when he\r\ncame upon his trial. Then it was immediately recollected that Mr.\r\nHolwell's designs were so wicked they certainly must be known to the\r\nNabob, though he never mentioned them in the conference of the morning\r\nor the evening of the 15th; yet such was now the weight and prevalence\r\nof them upon the Major's mind, that he calls upon Mr. Hastings to know\r\nwhether the Nabob was not informed of these designs of Mr. Holwell\r\nagainst him. Mr. Hastings's memory was not quite correct upon the\r\noccasion. He does not recollect anything of the matter. He certainly\r\nseems not to think that he ever mentioned it to the Nabob, or the Nabob\r\nto him; but he does recollect, he thinks, speaking something to some of\r\nthe Nabob's attendants upon it, and further this deponent sayeth not. On\r\nthis state of things, namely, the purity of intention, the necessities\r\nof the Company, the propriety of keeping the Nabob in perfect good-humor\r\nand removing suspicions from his mind, which suspicions he had never\r\nexpressed, they came to the resolution I shall have the honor to read to\r\nyou: \"That the representation, given in the said defence, of the state\r\nof the affairs of the country at that time\" (that is, about the month of\r\nApril, 1760) \"is true and just\" (that is, the bad state of the country,\r\nwhich we shall consider hereafter); \"that, in such circumstances, the\r\nNabob's urgent account of his own distresses, the Colonel's desire of\r\nmaking him easy,\" (for here is a recapitulation of the whole defence,)\r\n\"as the first thing necessary for the good of the service, and the\r\nsuddenness of the thing proposed, might deprive him for a moment of his\r\nrecollection, and surprise him into a measure which, as to the measure\r\nitself, he could not approve. That such only were the motives which did\r\nor could influence Colonel Calliaud to assent to the proposal is fully\r\nevinced by the deposition of Captain Knox and Mr. Lushington, that _his_\r\n[_Calliaud's_] _conscience, at the time, never reproached him with a bad\r\ndesign_.\"\r\n\r\nYour Lordships have heard of the testimony of a person to his own\r\nconscience; but the testimony of another man to any one's\r\nconscience--this is the first time, I believe, it ever appeared in a\r\njudicial proceeding. It is natural to say, \"My conscience acquits me of\r\nit\"; but _they_ declare, that \"_his_ conscience never reproached him\r\nwith a bad design, and therefore, upon the whole, they are satisfied\r\nthat his intention was good, though he erred in the measure.\"\r\n\r\nI beg leave to state one thing that escaped me: that the Nabob, who was\r\none of the parties to the design, was, at the time of the inquiry, a\r\nsort of prisoner or an exile at Calcutta; that his _moonshee_ was there,\r\nor might have been had; and that his spy was likewise there; and that\r\nthey, though parties to this transaction, were never called to account\r\nfor it in any sense or in any degree, or to show how far it was\r\n_necessary_ to quiet the Nabob's mind.\r\n\r\nThe accomplices, by acquitting him upon _their_ testimony to _his\r\nconscience_, did their business nobly. But the good Court of Directors,\r\nwho were so easily satisfied, so ready to condemn at the first\r\nproposition and so ready afterwards to acquit, put the last finishing\r\nhand of a master to it. For the accomplices acquit him of evil\r\nintentions and excuse his act. The Court of Directors, disapproving\r\nindeed the measure, but receiving the testimony of his conscience in\r\njustification of his conduct, and taking up the whole ground, honorably\r\nacquit him, and commend this action as an instance of heroic zeal in\r\ntheir service.\r\n\r\nThe great end and purpose for which I produce this to your Lordships is\r\nto show you the necessity there is for other inquiries, other trials,\r\nother acquittals of parties, than those made by a collusive clan abroad,\r\nor by the Directors at home, who had required the parties to inquire of\r\nthemselves, and to take the testimony of the judges at second-hand, as\r\nto the conscience of the party accused, respecting acts which neither\r\nthey nor any man living can look upon but with horror.\r\n\r\nI have troubled your Lordships with the story of the Three Seals, as a\r\nspecimen of the then state of the service, and the politics of the\r\nservants, civil and military, in the horrid abuses which then prevailed,\r\nand which render at length the most rigorous reformation necessary. I\r\nclose this episode to resume the proceedings at the second revolution.\r\n\r\nThis affair of the three seals was, we have seen, to quiet the fears of\r\nthe Nabob. His fears it was indeed necessary to quiet; for your\r\nLordships will see that the man whose fears were to be set asleep by\r\nMajor Calliaud's offering him, in a scheme for murdering his sovereign,\r\nan odd sort of opiate, made up of blood and treason, was now in a fair\r\nway of being murdered himself by the machinations of him whose seal was\r\nset to his murderous security of peace, and by those his accomplices,\r\nHolwell and Hastings: at least they resolved to put him in a situation\r\nin which his murder was in a manner inevitable, as you will see in the\r\nsequel of the transaction. Now the plan proceeds. The parties continued\r\nin the camp; but there was another _remora_. To remove a nabob and to\r\ncreate a revolution is not easy: houses are strong who have sons grown\r\nup with vigor and fitness for the command of armies. They are not easily\r\noverturned by removing the principal, unless the secondary is got rid\r\nof: and if this _remora_ could be removed, everything was going on in a\r\nhappy way in the business. This plan, which now (that is, about the\r\nmonth of July) began to get into great ripeness and forwardness, Mr.\r\nHolwell urged forward, Mr. Vansittart being hourly expected.\r\n\r\nI do not know whether I am going to state a thing, though it is upon the\r\nrecords, which will not have too theatrical an appearance for the grave\r\nstate in which we are. But here it is,--the difficulty, the knot, and\r\nthe solution, as recorded by the parties themselves. It was the object\r\nof this bold, desperate, designing man, Cossim All Khân, who aimed at\r\neverything, and who scrupled not to do anything in attaining what he\r\naimed at, to be appointed the lieutenant of the Nabob Jaffier Ali, and\r\nthus to get possession of his office during his lifetime under that\r\nname, with a design of murdering him: for that office, according to many\r\nusages of that country, totally supersedes the authority of the first\r\nmagistrate, renders him a cipher in his hand, gives the administration\r\nof his affairs and command of his troops to the lieutenant. It was a\r\npart of his plan, that he was, after his appointment to the lieutenancy,\r\nto be named to the succession of the Nabob, who had several other\r\nchildren; but the eldest son stood in the way.\r\n\r\nBut as things hastened to a crisis, this difficulty was removed in the\r\nmost extraordinary and providential unheard-of manner, by the most\r\nextraordinary event that, I believe, is recorded in history. Just in the\r\nnick of time, in the moment of projection, on the 3d of July, this\r\nPrince Meeran, in the flower of his age, bold, active, enterprising,\r\nlying asleep in his tent, is suddenly, without any one's knowing it,\r\nwithout any alarm or menace in the heavens that ever was heard of or\r\nmentioned, without any one whatever being hurt or even alarmed in the\r\ncamp, killed with a flash of lightning. My Lords, thus was the Gordian\r\nknot cut. This prince dies of a flash of lightning, and Mr. Lushington\r\n(of whom you have heard) comes in the morning with his hair standing\r\nerect, comes frightened into the presence of Major Calliaud, and, with\r\nthe utmost alarm, tells him of a circumstance that was afterwards to\r\ngive them so much pleasure. The alarm was immediately communicated to\r\nthe Major, who was seized with a fright; and fearing lest the army\r\nshould mutiny upon the death of their chief, it was contrived, in a\r\nmanner that I believe was most difficult to contrive, that what might\r\nhave excited a general mutiny was concealed by the ability, the good\r\nconduct, and dexterity of Major Calliaud for seven days together, till\r\nhe led the army out of the place of danger. Thus a judgment fell upon\r\none of the (innocent) murderers in the scene of the Three Seals. This\r\nman, who was probably guilty in his conscience as well as in act, thus\r\nfell by that most lucky, providential, and most useful flash of\r\nlightning.\r\n\r\nThere were at that time, it seems, in Calcutta, a wicked, skeptical set\r\nof people, who somehow or other believed that _human_ agency was\r\nconcerned in this elective flash, which came so very opportunely, and\r\nwhich was a favor so thankfully acknowledged. These wicked, ill-natured\r\nskeptics disseminated reports (which I am sure I do not mean to charge\r\nor prove, leaving the effect of them to you) very dishonorable, I\r\nbelieve, to Cossim Ali Khân in the business, and to some Englishmen who\r\nwere concerned.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of getting rid of Meeran being thus removed, Mr.\r\nVansittart comes upon the scene. I verily believe he was a man of good\r\nintentions, and rather debauched by that amazing flood of iniquity which\r\nprevailed at that time, or hurried and carried away with it. In a few\r\ndays he sent for Major Calliaud. All his objections vanish in _an\r\ninstant_: like that flash of lightning, everything is _instant_. The\r\nMajor agrees to perform his part. They send for Cossim Ali Khân and Mr.\r\nHastings; they open a treaty and conclude it with him, leaving the\r\nmanagement of it to two persons, Mr. Holwell and another person, whom we\r\nhave heard of, an Armenian, called Coja Petruse, who afterwards played\r\nhis part in another illustrious scene. By this Petruse and Mr. Holwell\r\nthe matter is settled. The moment Mr. Holwell is raised to be a\r\nSecretary of State, the revolution is accomplished. By it Cossim Ali\r\nKhân is to have the lieutenancy at present, and the succession.\r\nEverything is put into his hands, and he is to make for it large\r\nconcessions, which you will hear of afterwards, to the Company. Cossim\r\nAli Khân proposed to Mr. Holwell, what would have been no bad supplement\r\nto the flash of lightning, the murder of the Nabob; but Mr. Holwell was\r\na man of too much honor and conscience to suffer that. He instantly flew\r\nout at it, and declared the whole business should stop, unless the\r\naffair of the murder was given up. Accordingly things were so settled.\r\nBut if he gave the Nabob over to an intended murderer, and delivered his\r\nperson, treasure, and everything into his hands, Cossim Ali Khân might\r\nhave had no great reason to complain of being left to the execution of\r\nhis own projects in his own way. The treaty was made, and amounted to\r\nthis,--that the Company was to receive three great provinces: for here,\r\nas we proceed, you will have an opportunity of observing, with the\r\nprogress of these plots, one thing which has constantly and uniformly\r\npervaded the whole of these projects, and which the persons concerned in\r\nthem have avowed as a principle of their actions,--that they were first\r\nto take care of the Company's interest, then of their own; that is,\r\nfirst to secure to the Company an enormous bribe, and under the shadow\r\nof that bribe to take all the little emoluments they could to\r\nthemselves. Three great, rich, southern provinces, maritime, or nearly\r\nmaritime, Burdwan, Midnapoor, and Chittagong, were to be dissevered from\r\nthe Subah and to be ceded to the Company. There were other minor\r\nstipulations, which it is not necessary at present to trouble you with,\r\nsigned, sealed, and executed at Calcutta between these parties with the\r\ngreatest possible secrecy. The lieutenancy and the succession were\r\nsecured to Cossim Ali, and he was likewise to give somewhere about the\r\nsum of 200,000_l._ to the gentlemen who were concerned, as a reward for\r\nserving him so effectually, and for serving their country so well.\r\nAccordingly, these stipulations, actual or understood, (for they were\r\neventually carried into effect,) being settled, a commission of\r\ndelegation, consisting chiefly of Mr. Vansittart and Major Calliaud, was\r\nsent up to Moorshedabad: the new Governor taking this opportunity of\r\npaying the usual visit of respect to the Nabob, and in a manner which a\r\nnew Governor coming into place would do, with the detail of which it is\r\nnot necessary to trouble you. Mr. Hastings was at this time at the\r\ndurbar; and having everything prepared, and the ground smoothed, they\r\nfirst endeavored to persuade the Nabob to deliver over the power\r\nnegotiated for into the hands of their friend Cossim Ali Khân. But when\r\nthe old man, frightened out of his wits, asked, \"What is it he has bid\r\nfor me?\" and added, \"I will give half as much again to save myself; pray\r\nlet me know what my price is,\"--he entreated in vain. They were true,\r\nfirm, and faithful to their word and their engagement. When he saw they\r\nwere resolved that he should be delivered into the hands of Cossim Ali\r\nKhân, he at once surrenders the whole to him. They instantly grasp it.\r\nHe throws himself into a boat, and will not remain at home an hour, but\r\nhurries down to Calcutta to leave his blood at our door, if we should\r\nhave a mind to take it. But the life of the Nabob was too great a stake\r\n(partly as a security for the good behavior of Cossim Ali Khân, and\r\nstill more for the future use that might be made of him) to be thrown\r\naway, or left in the hands of a man who would certainly murder him, and\r\nwho was very angry at being refused the murder of his father-in-law. The\r\nprice of this second revolution was, according to their shares in it, (I\r\nbelieve I have it here,) somewhere about 200,000_l._ This little\r\neffusion to private interest settled the matter, and here ended the\r\nsecond revolution in the country: effected, indeed, without bloodshed,\r\nbut with infinite treachery, with infinite mischief, consequent to the\r\ndismemberment of the country, and which had nearly become fatal to our\r\nconcerns there, like everything else in which Mr. Hastings had any\r\nshare.\r\n\r\nThis prince, Cossim Ali Khân, the friend of Mr. Hastings, knew that\r\nthose who could give could take away dominion. He had scarcely got upon\r\nthe throne, procured for him by our public spirit and his own\r\niniquities, than he began directly and instantly to fortify himself, and\r\nto bend all his politics against those who were or could be the donors\r\nof such fatal gifts. He began with the natives who were in their\r\ninterest, and cruelly put to death, under the eye of Mr. Hastings and\r\nhis clan, all those who, by their moneyed wealth or landed\r\nconsideration, could give any effect to their dispositions in favor of\r\nthose ambitious strangers. He removed from Moorshedabad higher up into\r\nthe country, to Monghir, in order to be more out of our view. He kept\r\nhis word pretty well, but not altogether faithfully, with the gentlemen;\r\nand though he had no money, for his treasury was empty, he gave\r\nobligations which are known by the name of _jeeps_--(the Indian\r\nvocabulary will by degrees become familiar to your Lordships, as we\r\ndevelop the modes and customs of the country). As soon as he had done\r\nthis, he began to rack and tear the provinces that were left to him, to\r\nget as much from them as should compensate him for the revenues of those\r\ngreat provinces he had lost; and accordingly he began a scene of\r\nextortion, horrible, nefarious, without precedent or example, upon\r\nalmost all the landed interest of that country. I mention this, because\r\nhe is one of those persons whose governments Mr. Hastings, in a paper\r\ncalled his Defence, delivered in to the House of Commons, has produced\r\nas precedents and examples which he has thought fit to follow, and which\r\nhe thought would justify him in the conduct he has pursued. This Cossim\r\nAli Khân, after he had acted the tyrant on the landed interest, fell\r\nupon the moneyed interest. In that country there was a person called\r\nJuggut Seit. There were several of the family, who were bankers to such\r\na magnitude as was never heard of in the world. Receivers of the public\r\nrevenue, their correspondence extended all over Asia; and there are\r\nthose who are of opinion that the house of Juggut Seit, including all\r\nits branches, was not worth less than six or seven millions sterling.\r\nThis house became the prey of Cossim Ali Khân; but Mr. Holwell had\r\npredicted that _it should be delivered over to Satan to be buffeted_\r\n(his own pious expression). He predicted the misfortunes that should\r\nbefall them; and we chose a Satan to buffet them, and who did so buffet\r\nthem, by the murder of the principal persons of the house, and by\r\nrobbing them of great sums of their wealth, that I believe such a scene\r\nof nefarious tyranny, destroying and cutting up the root of public\r\ncredit in that country, was scarce ever known. In the mean time Cossim\r\nwas extending his tyranny over all who were obnoxious to him; and the\r\npersons he first sought were those traitors who had been friends to the\r\nEnglish. Several of the principal of these he murdered. There was in the\r\nprovince of Bahar a man named Ramarain; he had got the most positive\r\nassurances of English faith; but Mr. Macguire, a member of the Council,\r\non the receipt of five thousand gold mohurs, or something more than\r\n8,000_l._ sterling, delivered him up to be first imprisoned, then\r\ntortured, then robbed in consequence of the torture, and finally\r\nmurdered, by Cossim Ali Khân. In this way Cossim Ali Khân acted, while\r\nour government looked on. I hardly choose to mention to you the fate of\r\na certain native in consequence of a dispute with Mr. Mott, a friend of\r\nMr. Hastings, which is in the Company's records,--records which are\r\nalmost buried by their own magnitude from the knowledge of this country.\r\nIn a contest with this native for his house and property, some scuffle\r\nhaving happened between the parties, the one attempting to seize and the\r\nother to defend, the latter made a complaint to the Nabob, who was in an\r\nentire subjection at that time to the English, and who ordered this\r\nunfortunate man, on account of this very scuffle, arising from\r\ndefending his property, to be blown off from the mouth of a cannon. In\r\nshort, I am not able to tell your Lordships of all the nefarious\r\ntransactions of this man, whom the intrigues of Mr. Holwell and Mr.\r\nHastings had set upon the throne of Bengal. But there is a circumstance\r\nin this business that comes across here, and will tend to show another\r\ngrievance that vexed that country, which vexed it long, and is one of\r\nthe causes of its chief disasters, and which, I fear, is not so\r\nperfectly extirpated but that some part of its roots may remain in the\r\nground at this moment.\r\n\r\nCommerce, which enriches every other country in the world, was bringing\r\nBengal to total ruin. The Company, in former times, when it had no\r\nsovereignty or power in the country, had large privileges under their\r\n_dustuck_, or permit: their goods passed, without paying duties, through\r\nthe country. The servants of the Company made use of this dustuck for\r\ntheir own private trade, which, while it was used with moderation, the\r\nnative government winked at in some degree; but when it got wholly into\r\nprivate hands, it was more like robbery than trade. These traders\r\nappeared everywhere; they sold at their own prices, and forced the\r\npeople to sell to them at their own prices also. It appeared more like\r\nan army going to pillage the people, under pretence of commerce, than\r\nanything else. In vain the people claimed the protection of their own\r\ncountry courts. This English army of traders in their march ravaged\r\nworse than a Tartarian conqueror. The trade they carried on, and which\r\nmore resembled robbery than commerce, anticipated the resources of the\r\ntyrant, and threatened to leave him no materials for imposition or\r\nconfiscation. Thus this miserable country was torn to pieces by the\r\nhorrible rapaciousness of a double tyranny. This appeared to be so\r\nstrong a case, that a deputation was sent to him at his new capital,\r\nMonghir, to form a treaty for the purpose of giving some relief against\r\nthis cruel, cursed, and oppressive trade, which was worse even than the\r\ntyranny of the sovereign. This trade Mr. Vansittart, the President about\r\nthis time, that is, in 1763, who succeeded to Mr. Holwell, and was in\r\nclose union of interests with the tyrant Cossim Ali Khân, by a treaty\r\nknown by the name of the treaty of Monghir, agreed very much to suppress\r\nand to confine within something like reasonable bounds. There never was\r\na doubt on the face of that treaty, that it was a just, proper, fair\r\ntransaction. But as nobody in Bengal did then believe that rapine was\r\never forborne but in favor of bribery, the persons who lost every\r\nadvantage by the treaty of Monghir, when they thought they saw corrupt\r\nnegotiation carrying away the prizes of unlawful commerce, and were\r\nlikely to see their trade crippled by Cossim Ali Khân, fell into a most\r\nviolent fury at this treaty; and as the treaty was made without the\r\nconcurrence of the rest of the Council, the Company's servants grew\r\ndivided: one part were the advocates of the treaty, the other of the\r\ntrade. The latter were universally of opinion that the treaty was bought\r\nfor a great sum of money. The evidence we have on our records of the\r\nsums of money that are stated to have been paid on this occasion has\r\nnever been investigated to the bottom; but we have it on record, that a\r\ngreat sum (70,000_l._) was paid to persons concerned in that\r\nnegotiation. The rest were exceedingly wroth to see themselves not\r\nprofiting by the negotiation, and losing the trade, or likely to be\r\nexcluded from it; and they were the more so, because, as we have it upon\r\nour journals, during all that time the trade of the negotiators was not\r\nproscribed, but a purwannah was issued by Cossim Ali Khân, that the\r\ntrade of his friends Mr. Vansittart and Mr. Hastings should not be\r\nsubject to the general regulations. This filled the whole settlement\r\nwith ill blood; but in the regulation itself (I put the motive and the\r\nsecret history out of the case) undoubtedly Mr. Hastings and Mr.\r\nVansittart were on the right side. They had shown to a demonstration the\r\nmischief of this trade. However, as the other party were strong, and did\r\nnot readily let go their hold of this great advantage, first,\r\ndissensions, murmurs, various kinds of complaints, and ill blood arose.\r\nCossim Ali was driven to the wall; and having at the same time made what\r\nhe thought good preparations, a war broke out at last. And how did it\r\nbreak out? This Cossim Ali Khân signalized his first acts of hostility\r\nby an atrocity committed against the faith of treaties, against the\r\nrules of war, against every principle of honor. This intended murderer\r\nof his father-in-law, whom Mr. Hastings had assisted to raise to the\r\nthrone of Bengal, well knowing his character and his disposition, and\r\nwell knowing what such a man was capable of doing,--this man massacred\r\nthe English wherever he met them. There were two hundred, or\r\nthereabouts, of the Company's servants, or their dependants, slaughtered\r\nat Patna with every circumstance of the most abominable cruelty. Their\r\nlimbs were cut to pieces. The tyrant whom Mr. Hastings set up cut and\r\nhacked the limbs of British subjects in the most cruel and perfidious\r\nmanner, threw them into wells, and polluted the waters of the country\r\nwith British blood. Immediately war is declared against him in form.\r\nThat war sets the whole country in a blaze; and then other parties begin\r\nto appear upon the scene, whose transactions you will find yourselves\r\ndeeply concerned in hereafter.\r\n\r\nAs soon as war was declared against Cossim, it was necessary to resolve\r\nto put up another Nabob, and to have another revolution: and where do\r\nthey resort, but to the man whom, for his alleged tyranny, for his\r\nincapacity, for the numberless iniquities he was said to have committed,\r\nand for his total unfitness and disinclination to all the duties of\r\ngovernment, they had dethroned? This very man they take up again, to\r\nplace on the throne from which they had about two years before removed\r\nhim, and for the effecting of which they had committed so many\r\niniquities. Even this revolution was not made without being paid for.\r\nAccording to the usual order of procession, in which the youngest walk\r\nfirst, first comes the Company; and the Company had secured to it in\r\nperpetuity those provinces which Cossim Ali Khân had ceded, as it was\r\nthought, rather in the way of mortgage than anything else. Then, under\r\nthe name of compensation for sufferings to the people concerned in the\r\ntrade, and in the name of donation to an army and a navy which had\r\nlittle to do in this affair, they tax him--what sum do you think? They\r\ntax that empty and undone treasury of that miserable and undone country\r\n500,000_l._ for a private emolument to themselves,--for the compensation\r\nfor this iniquitous trade,--for the compensation for abuses of which he\r\nwas neither the author nor the abettor, they tax this miserable prince\r\n500,000_l._ That sum was given to individuals. Now comes the Company at\r\nhome, which, on hearing this news, was all inflamed. The Directors were\r\non fire. They were shocked at it, and particularly at this donation to\r\nthe army and navy. They resolved they would give it no countenance and\r\nsupport. In the mean time the gentlemen did not trouble their heads upon\r\nthat subject, but meant to exact and get their 500,000_l._ as they\r\ncould.\r\n\r\nHere was a third revolution, bought at this amazing sum, and this poor,\r\nmiserable prince first dragged from Moorshedabad to Calcutta, then\r\ndragged back from Calcutta to Moorshedabad, the sport of fortune and the\r\nplaything of avarice. This poor man is again set up, but is left with no\r\nauthority: his troops limited,--his person, everything about him, in a\r\nmanner subjugated,--a British Resident the master of his court: he is\r\nset up as a pageant on this throne, with no other authority but what\r\nwould be sufficient to give a countenance to presents, gifts, and\r\ndonations. That authority was always left, when all the rest was taken\r\naway. One would have thought that this revolution might have satisfied\r\nthese gentlemen, and that the money gained by it would have been\r\nsufficient. No. The partisans of Cossim Ali wanted another revolution.\r\nThe partisans of the other side wished to have something more done in\r\nthe present. They now began to think that to depose Cossim instantly,\r\nand to sell him to another, was too much at one time,--especially as\r\nCossim Ali was a man of vigor and resolution, carrying on a fierce war\r\nagainst them. But what do you think they did? They began to see, from\r\nthe example of Cossim Ali, that the lieutenancy, the ministry of the\r\nking, was a good thing to be sold, and the sale of that might turn out\r\nas good a thing as the sale of the prince.\r\n\r\nFor this office there were two rival candidates, persons of great\r\nconsideration, in Bengal: one, a principal Mahomedan, called Mahomed\r\nReza Khân, a man of high authority, great piety in his own religion,\r\ngreat learning in the law, of the very first class of Mahomedan\r\nnobility; but at the same time, on all these accounts, he was abhorred\r\nand dreaded by the Nabob, who necessarily feared that a man of Mahomed\r\nReza Khân's description would be considered as better entitled and\r\nfitter for his seat, as Nabob of the provinces. To balance him, there\r\nwas another man, known by the name of the Great Rajah Nundcomar. This\r\nman was accounted the highest of his caste, and held the same rank among\r\nthe Gentoos that Mahomed Reza Khân obtained among the Mahomedans. The\r\nprince on the throne had no jealousy of Nundcomar, because he knew,\r\nthat, as a Gentoo, he could not aspire to the office of Subahdar. For\r\nthat reason he was firmly attached to him; he might depend completely on\r\nhis services; he was _his_ against Mahomed Reza Khân, and against the\r\nwhole world. There was, however, a flaw in the Nabob's title, which it\r\nwas necessary should be hid. And perhaps it lay against Mahomed Reza\r\nKhân as well as him. But it was a source of apprehension to the Nabob,\r\nand contributed to make him wish to keep all Mahomedan influence at a\r\ndistance. For he was a Syed, that is to say, a descendant of Mahomet,\r\nand as such, though of the only acknowledged nobility among Mussulmen,\r\nwould be by that circumstance excluded, by the known laws of the Mogul\r\nempire, from being Subahdar in any of the Mogul provinces, in case the\r\nrevival of the constitution of that empire should ever again take place.\r\n\r\nAn auction was now opened before the English Council at Calcutta.\r\nMahomed Reza Khân bid largely; Nundcomar bid largely. The circumstances\r\nof these two rivals at the Nabob court were equally favorable to the\r\npretensions of each. But the preponderating merits of Mahomed Reza Khân,\r\narising from the subjection in which he was likely to keep the Nabob,\r\nand make him fitter for the purpose of continued exactions, induced the\r\nCouncil to take his money, which amounted to about 220,000_l._ Be the\r\nsum paid what it may, it was certainly a large one; in consequence of\r\nwhich the Council attempted to invest Mahomed Reza Khân with the office\r\nof Naib Subah, or Deputy Viceroy. As to Nundcomar, they fell upon him\r\nwith a vengeful fury. He fought his battle as well as he could; he\r\nopposed bribe to bribe, eagle to eagle; but at length he was driven to\r\nthe wall. Some received his money, but did him no service in return;\r\nothers, more conscientious, refused to receive it; and in this battle of\r\nbribes he was vanquished. A deputation was sent from Calcutta to the\r\nmiserable Nabob, to tear Nundcomar, his only support, from his side, and\r\nto put the object of all his terrors, Mahomed Reza Khân, in his place.\r\n\r\nThus began a new division that split the Presidency into violent\r\nfactions; but the faction which adhered to Nundcomar was undoubtedly the\r\nweakest. That most miserable of men, Mir Jaffier Ali Khân, clinging, as\r\nto the last pillar, to Nundcomar, trembling at Mahomed Reza Khân, died\r\nin the struggle, a miserable victim to all the revolutions, to all the\r\nsuccessive changes and versatile politics at Calcutta. Like all the rest\r\nof the great personages whom we have degraded and brutalized by insult\r\nand oppression, he betook himself to the usual destructive resources of\r\nunprincipled misery,--sensuality, opium, and wine. His gigantic frame of\r\nconstitution soon gave way under the oppression of this relief, and he\r\ndied, leaving children and grandchildren by wives and concubines. On the\r\nold Nabob's death, Mahomed Reza Khân was acknowledged Deputy Nabob, the\r\nmoney paid, and this revolution completed.\r\n\r\nHere, my Lords, opened a new source of plunder, peculation, and bribery,\r\nwhich was not neglected. Revolutions were no longer necessary;\r\nsuccession supplied their places: and well the object agreed with the\r\npolicy. Rules of succession could not be very well ascertained to an\r\noffice like that of the Nabob, which was hereditary only by the\r\nappointment of the Mogul. The issue by lawful wives would naturally be\r\npreferred by those who meant the quiet of the country. But a more\r\ndoubtful title was preferred, as better adapted to the purposes of\r\nextortion and peculation. This miserable succession was sold, and the\r\neldest of the issue of Munny Begum, an harlot, brought in to pollute the\r\nharem of the seraglio, of whom you will hear much hereafter, was chosen.\r\nHe soon succeeded to the grave. Another son of the same prostitute\r\nsucceeded to the same unhappy throne, and followed to the same untimely\r\ngrave. Every succession was sold; and between venal successions and\r\nvenal revolutions, in a very few years seven princes and six sales were\r\nseen successively in Bengal. The last was a minor, the issue of a\r\nlegitimate wife, admitted to succeed because a minor, and because there\r\nwas none illegitimate left. He was instantly stripped of the allowance\r\nof his progenitors, and reduced to a pension of 160,000 a year. He still\r\nexists, and continued to the end of Mr. Hastings's government to furnish\r\nconstant sources of bribery and plunder to him and his creatures.\r\n\r\nThe offspring of Munny Begum clinging, as his father did, to Nundcomar,\r\nthey tore Nundcomar from his side, as they had done from the side of his\r\nfather, and carried him down as a sort of prisoner to Calcutta; where,\r\nhaving had the weakness to become the first informer, he was made the\r\nfirst example. This person, pushed to the wall, and knowing that the man\r\nhe had to deal with was desperate and cruel in his resentments, resolves\r\non the first blow, and enters before the Council a regular information\r\nin writing of bribery against Mr. Hastings. In his preface to that\r\ncharge he excuses himself for what is considered to be an act equally\r\ninsane and wicked, and as the one inexpiable crime of an Indian, the\r\ndiscovery of the money he gives,--that Mr. Hastings had declaredly\r\ndetermined on his ruin, and to accomplish it had newly associated\r\nhimself with one Mohun Persaud, a name I wish your Lordships to\r\nremember, a bitter enemy of his, an infamous person, whom Mr. Hastings\r\nknew to be such, and as such had turned him out of his house,--that Mr.\r\nHastings had lately recalled, and held frequent communications with this\r\nMohun Persaud, the subject of which he had no doubt was his ruin. In the\r\nyear 1775 he was hanged by those incorrupt English judges who were sent\r\nto India by Parliament to protect the natives from oppression.\r\n\r\nYour Lordships will observe that this new sale of the office of\r\nministers succeeded to the sale of that of nabobs. All these varied and\r\nsuccessive sales shook the country to pieces. As if those miserable\r\nexhausted provinces were to be cured of inanition by phlebotomy, while\r\nCossim Ali was racking it above, the Company were drawing off all its\r\nnutriment below. A dreadful, an extensive, and most chargeable war\r\nfollowed. Half the northern force of India poured down like a torrent on\r\nBengal, endangered our existence, and exhausted all our resources. The\r\nwar was the fruit of Mr. Hastings's cabals. Its termination, as usual,\r\nwas the result of the military merit and the fortune of this nation.\r\nCossim Ali, after having been defeated toy the military genius and\r\nspirit of England, (for the Adamses, Monroes, and others of that period,\r\nI believe, showed as much skill and bravery as any of their\r\npredecessors,) in his flight swept away above three millions in money,\r\njewels, or effects, out of a country which he had plundered and\r\nexhausted by his unheard-of exactions. However, he fought his way like a\r\nretiring lion, turning his face to his pursuers. He still fought along\r\nhis frontier. His ability and his money drew to his cause the Subahdar\r\nof Oude, the famous Sujah ul Dowlah. The Mogul entered into these wars,\r\nand penetrated into the lower provinces on one side, whilst Bulwant\r\nSing, the Rajah of Benares, entered them on another. After various\r\nchanges of party and changes of fortune, the loss which began in the\r\ntreachery of the civil service was, as I have before remarked, redeemed\r\nby military merit. Many examples of the same sort have since been seen.\r\n\r\nWhilst these things were transacted in India, the Court of Directors in\r\nLondon, hearing of so many changes, hearing of such an incredible mass\r\nof perfidy and venality, knowing that there was a general market made of\r\nthe country and of the Company, that the flame of war spread from\r\nprovince to province, that, in proportion as it spread, the fire glowed\r\nwith augmented fierceness, and that the rapacity which originally gave\r\nrise to it was following it in all its progress,--the Company, my Lords,\r\nalarmed not only for their acquisitions, but their existence, and\r\nfinding themselves sinking lower and lower by every victory they\r\nobtained, thought it necessary at length to come to some system and some\r\nsettlement. After composing their differences with Lord Clive, they sent\r\nhim out to that country about the year 1765, in order, by his name,\r\nweight, authority, and vigor of mind, to give some sort of form and\r\nstability to government, and to rectify the innumerable abuses which\r\nprevailed there, and particularly that great source of disorders, that\r\nfundamental abuse, presents: for the bribes by which all these\r\nrevolutions were bought had not the name of conditions, stipulations, or\r\nrewards; they even had the free and gratuitous style of presents. The\r\nreceivers contended that they were mere gratuities given for service\r\ndone, or mere tokens of affection and gratitude to the parties. They may\r\ngive them what names they please, and your Lordships will think of them\r\nwhat you please; but they were the donations of misery to power, the\r\ngifts of sufferers to the oppressors; and consequently, where they\r\nprevailed, they left no certain property or fixed situation to any man\r\nin India, from the highest to the lowest.\r\n\r\nThe Court of Directors sent out orders to enlarge the servants'\r\ncovenants with new and severe clauses, strongly prohibiting the practice\r\nof receiving presents. Lord Clive himself had been a large receiver of\r\nthem. Yet, as it was in the moment of a revolution which gave them all\r\nthey possessed, the Company would hear no more of it. They sent him out\r\nto reform: whether they chose well or ill does not signify. I think,\r\nupon the whole, they chose well; because his name and authority could do\r\nmuch. They sent him out to redress the grievances of that country, and\r\nit was necessary he should be well armed for that service. They sent him\r\nout with such powers as no servant of the Company ever held before. I\r\nwould not be understood here in my own character, much less in the\r\ndelegated character in which I stand, to contend for any man in the\r\ntotality of his conduct. Perhaps in some of his measures he was\r\nmistaken, and in some of his acts reprehensible; but justice obliges me\r\nto say, that the plan which he formed and the course which he pursued\r\nwere in general great and well imagined,--that he laid great\r\nfoundations, if they had been properly built upon. For, in the first\r\nplace, he composed all the neighboring countries torn to pieces by the\r\nwars of Cossim Ali, and quieted the apprehensions raised by the opinion\r\nof the boundless ambition of England. He took strong measures to put an\r\nend to a great many of the abuses that prevailed in the country subject\r\nto the Company. He then proceeded to the upper provinces, and formed a\r\nplan which, for a military man, has great civil and political merit. He\r\nput a bound to the aspiring spirit of the Company's servants; he limited\r\nits conquests; he prescribed bounds to its ambition. \"First\" (says he)\r\n\"quiet the minds of the country; what you have obtained regulate; make\r\nit known to India that you resolve to acquire no more.\"\r\n\r\nOn this solid plan he fixed every prince that was concerned in the\r\npreceding wars, on the one side and on the other, in an happy and easy\r\nsettlement. He restored Sujah ul Dowlah, who had been driven from his\r\ndominions by the military arm of Great Britain, to the rank of Vizier,\r\nand to the dominion of the territories of Oude. With a generosity that\r\nastonished all Asia, he reinstated this expelled enemy of his nation\r\npeaceably upon his throne. And this act of politic generosity did more\r\ntowards quieting the minds of the people of Asia than all the terror,\r\ngreat as it was, of the English arms. At the same time, Lord Clive,\r\ngenerous to all, took peculiar care of our friends and allies. He took\r\ncare of Bulwant Sing, the great Rajah of Benares, who had taken our part\r\nin the war. He secured him from the revenge of Sujah ul Dowlah. The\r\nMogul had granted us the superiority over Bulwant Sing. Lord Clive\r\nreëstablished him in a secure, easy independency. He confirmed him,\r\nunder the British guaranty, in the rich principality which he held.\r\n\r\nThe Mogul, the head of the Mussulman religion in India, and of the\r\nIndian empire, a head honored and esteemed even in its ruins, he\r\nprocured to be recognized by all the persons that were connected with\r\nhis empire. The rents that ought to be paid to the Vizier of the Empire\r\nhe gave to the Vizierate. Thus our alliances were cemented, our enemies\r\nwere reconciled, all Asia was conciliated by our settlement with the\r\nking. To that unhappy fugitive king, driven from place to place, the\r\nsport of fortune, now an emperor and now a prisoner, prayed for in every\r\nmosque in which his authority was conspired against, one day opposed by\r\nthe coin struck in his name and the other day sold for it,--to this\r\ndescendant of Tamerlane he allotted, with a decent share of royal\r\ndignity, an honorable fixed residence, where he might be useful and\r\ncould not be dangerous.\r\n\r\nAs to the Bengal provinces, he did not take for the Company the\r\nviceroyalty, as Mr. Holwell would have persuaded, almost forced, the\r\nCompany to do; but, to satisfy the prejudices of the Mahomedans, the\r\ncountry was left in the hands nominally of the Subah, or viceroy, who\r\nwas to administer the criminal justice and the exterior forms of\r\nroyalty. He obtained from the sovereign the _dewanny_. This is the great\r\nact of the constitutional entrance of the Company into the body politic\r\nof India. It gave to the settlement of Bengal a fixed constitutional\r\nform, with a legal title, acknowledged and recognized now for the first\r\ntime by all the natural powers of the country, because it arose from the\r\ncharter of the undoubted sovereign. The _dewanny_, or high-stewardship,\r\ngave to the Company the collection and management of the revenue; and in\r\nthis modest and civil character they appeared, not the oppressors, but\r\nthe protectors of the people. This scheme had all the real power,\r\nwithout any invidious appearance of it; it gave them the revenue,\r\nwithout the parade of sovereignty. On this double foundation the\r\ngovernment was happily settled. The minds of the natives were quieted.\r\nThe Company's territories and views were circumscribed. The arm of force\r\nwas put out of sight. The imperial name covered everything. The power of\r\nthe purse was in the hand of the Company. The power of the sword was in\r\neffect so, as they contracted for the maintenance of the army. The\r\nCompany had a revenue of a million and a half. The Nabob had, indeed,\r\nfallen from any real and effective power, yet the dignity of the court\r\nwas maintained. The prejudices and interests of the Mahomedans, and\r\nparticularly of their nobility, who had suffered more by this great\r\nrevolution even than the old inhabitants of the country, were consulted;\r\nfor by this plan a revenue of 500,000_l._ was settled on the\r\nviceroyalty, which was thus enabled to provide in some measure for those\r\ngreat families. The Company likewise, by this plan, in order to enjoy\r\ntheir revenues securely, and to avoid envy and murmur, put them into the\r\nhands of Mahomed Reza Khân, whom Lord Clive found in the management of\r\naffairs, and did not displace; and he was now made deputy-steward to the\r\nCompany, as he had been before lieutenant-viceroy to the Nabob. A\r\nBritish Resident at Moorshedabad was established as a control. The\r\nCompany exercised their power over the revenue in the first instance\r\nthrough the natives, but the British Resident was in reality the great\r\nmover.\r\n\r\nIf ever this nation stood in a situation of glory throughout Asia, it\r\nwas in that moment. But, as I have said, some material errors and\r\nmistakes were committed. After the formation of this plan, Lord Clive\r\nunfortunately did not stay long enough in the country to give\r\nconsistency to the measures of reformation he had undertaken, but\r\nrapidly returned to England; and after his departure, the government\r\nthat continued had not vigor or authority to support the settlement then\r\nmade, and considerable abuses began to prevail in every quarter. Another\r\ncapital period in our history here commences. Those who succeeded\r\n(though I believe one of them was one of the honestest men that ever\r\nserved the Company, I mean Governor Verelst) had not weight enough to\r\npoise the system of the service, and consequently many abuses and\r\ngrievances again prevailed. Supervisors were appointed to every\r\ndistrict, as a check on the native collectors, and to report every abuse\r\nas it should arise. But they who were appointed to redress grievances\r\nwere themselves accused of being guilty of them. However, the disorders\r\nwere not of that violent kind which preceded Mr. Hastings's departure,\r\nnor such as followed his return: no mercenary wars, no mercenary\r\nrevolutions, no extirpation of nations, no violent convulsions in the\r\nrevenue, no subversion of ancient houses, no general sales of any\r\ndescriptions of men,--none of these, but certainly such grievances as\r\nmade it necessary for the Company to send out another commission in\r\n1769, with instructions pointing out the chief abuses. It was composed\r\nof Mr. Vansittart, Mr. Ford, and Mr. Scrafton. The unfortunate end of\r\nthat commission is known to all the world; but I mention it in order to\r\nstate that the receipt of presents was considered as one of the\r\ngrievances which then prevailed in India, and that the supervisors under\r\nthat commission were ordered upon no account whatever to take presents.\r\nUpon the unfortunate catastrophe which happened, the Company was\r\npreparing to send out another for the rectification of these grievances,\r\nwhen Parliament thought it necessary to supersede that commission, to\r\ntake the matter into their own hands, and to appoint another commission\r\nin a Parliamentary way (of which Mr. Hastings was one) for the better\r\ngovernment of that country. Mr. Hastings, as I must mention to your\r\nLordships, soon after the deposition and restoration of Jaffier Ali\r\nKhân, and before Lord Clive arrived, quitted for a while the scene in\r\nwhich he had been so mischievously employed, and returned to England to\r\nstrengthen himself by those cabals which again sent him out with new\r\nauthority to pursue the courses which were the natural sequel to his\r\nformer proceedings. He returned to India with great power,\r\nindeed,--first to a seat in Council at Fort St. George, and from thence\r\nto succeed to the Presidency of Fort William. On him the Company placed\r\ntheir chief reliance. Happy had it been for them, happy for India and\r\nfor England, if his conduct had been such as to spare your Lordships and\r\nthe Commons the exhibition of this day!\r\n\r\nWhen this government, with Mr. Hastings at the head of it, was settled,\r\nMoorshedabad did still continue the seat of the native government, and\r\nof all the collections. Here the Company was not satisfied with placing\r\na Resident at the durbar, which was the first step to our assuming the\r\ngovernment in that country. These steps must be traced by your\r\nLordships; for I should never have given you this trouble, if it was not\r\nnecessary to possess you clearly of the several progressive steps by\r\nwhich the Company's government came to be established and to supersede\r\nthe native. The next step was the appointment of supervisors in every\r\nprovince, to oversee the native collector. The third was to establish a\r\ngeneral Council of Revenue at Moorshedabad, to superintend the great\r\nsteward, Mahomed Reza Khân. In 1772 that Council by Mr. Hastings was\r\noverturned, and the whole management of the revenue brought to Calcutta.\r\nMahomed Reza Khân, by orders of the Company, was turned out of all his\r\noffices, and turned out for reasons and principles which your Lordships\r\nwill hereafter see; and at last the dewanny was entirely taken out of\r\nthe native hands, and settled in the Supreme Council and Presidency\r\nitself in Calcutta; and so it remained until the year 1781, when Mr.\r\nHastings made another revolution, took it out of the hands of the\r\nSupreme Council, in which the orders of the Company, an act of\r\nParliament, and their own act had vested it, and put it into a\r\nsubordinate council: that is, it was entirely vested in himself.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNow your Lordships see the whole of the revolutions. I have stated them,\r\nI trust, with perspicuity,--stated the grounds and principles upon which\r\nthey were made,--stated the abuses that grew upon them,--and that every\r\nrevolution produced its abuse. You saw the native government vanish by\r\ndegrees, until it was reduced to a situation fit for nothing but to\r\nbecome a private perquisite, as it has been, to Mr. Hastings, and to be\r\ngranted to whom he pleased. The English government succeeded, at the\r\nhead of which Mr. Hastings was placed by an act of Parliament, having\r\nbefore held the office of President of the Council,--the express object\r\nof both these appointments being to redress grievances; and within these\r\ntwo periods of his power, as President and Governor-General, were those\r\ncrimes committed of which he now stands accused. All this history is\r\nmerely by way of illustration: his crimination begins from his\r\nnomination to the Presidency; and we are to consider how he comported\r\nhimself in that station, and in his office of Governor-General.\r\n\r\nThe first thing, in considering the merits or demerits of any governor,\r\nis to have some test by which they are to be tried. And here, my Lords,\r\nwe conceive, that, when a British governor is sent abroad, he is sent to\r\npursue the good of the people as much as possible in the spirit of the\r\nlaws of this country, which in all respects intend their conservation,\r\ntheir happiness, and their prosperity. This is the principle upon which\r\nMr. Hastings was bound to govern, and upon which he is to account for\r\nhis conduct here. His rule was, what a British governor, intrusted with\r\nthe power of this country, was bound to do or to forbear. If he has\r\nperformed and if he has abstained as he ought, dismiss him honorably\r\nacquitted from your bar; otherwise condemn him. He may resort to other\r\nprinciples and to other maxims; but this country will force him to be\r\ntried by its laws. The law of this country recognizes that well-known\r\ncrime called misconduct in office; it is a head of the law of England,\r\nand, so far as inferior courts are competent to try it, may be tried in\r\nthem. Here your Lordships' competence is plenary: you are fully\r\ncompetent both to inquire into and to punish the offence.\r\n\r\nAnd, first, I am to state to your Lordships, by the direction of those\r\nwhom I am bound to obey, the principles on which Mr. Hastings declares\r\nhe has conducted his government,--principles which he has avowed, first\r\nin several letters written to the East India Company, next in a paper of\r\ndefence delivered to the House of Commons explicitly, and more\r\nexplicitly in his defence before your Lordships. Nothing in Mr.\r\nHastings's proceedings is so curious as his several defences; and\r\nnothing in the defences is so singular as the principles upon which he\r\nproceeds. Your Lordships will have to decide not only upon a large,\r\nconnected, systematic train of misdemeanors, but an equally connected\r\nsystem of principles and maxims of government, invented to justify those\r\nmisdemeanors. He has brought them forward and avowed them in the face of\r\nday. He has boldly and insultingly thrown them in the face of the\r\nrepresentatives of a free people, and we cannot pass them by without\r\nadopting them. I am directed to protest against those grounds and\r\nprinciples upon which he frames his defence; for, if those grounds are\r\ngood and valid, they carry off a great deal at least, if not entirely,\r\nthe foundation of our charge.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, we contend that Mr. Hastings, as a British governor, ought to\r\ngovern on British principles, not by British forms,--God forbid!--for if\r\never there was a case in which the letter kills and the spirit gives\r\nlife, it would be an attempt to introduce British forms and the\r\nsubstance of despotic principles together into any country. No! We call\r\nfor that spirit of equity, that spirit of justice, that spirit of\r\nprotection, that spirit of lenity, which ought to characterize every\r\nBritish subject in power; and on these, and these principles only, he\r\nwill be tried.\r\n\r\nBut he has told your Lordships, in his defence, that actions in Asia do\r\nnot bear the same moral qualities which the same actions would bear in\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, we positively deny that principle. I am authorized and called\r\nupon to deny it. And having stated at large what he means by saying that\r\nthe same actions have not the same qualities in Asia and in Europe, we\r\nare to let your Lordships know that these gentlemen have formed a plan\r\nof _geographical morality_, by which the duties of men, in public and in\r\nprivate situations, are not to be governed by their relation to the\r\ngreat Governor of the Universe, or by their relation to mankind, but by\r\nclimates, degrees of longitude, parallels, not of life, but of\r\nlatitudes: as if, when you have crossed the equinoctial, all the virtues\r\ndie, as they say some insects die when they cross the line; as if there\r\nwere a kind of baptism, like that practised by seamen, by which they\r\nunbaptize themselves of all that they learned in Europe, and after which\r\na new order and system of things commenced.\r\n\r\nThis geographical morality we do protest against; Mr. Hastings shall not\r\nscreen himself under it; and on this point I hope and trust many words\r\nwill not be necessary to satisfy your Lordships. But we think it\r\nnecessary, in justification of ourselves, to declare that the laws of\r\nmorality are the same everywhere, and that there is no action which\r\nwould pass for an act of extortion, of peculation, of bribery, and of\r\noppression in England, that is not an act of extortion, of peculation,\r\nof bribery, and oppression in Europe, Asia, Africa, and all the world\r\nover. This I contend for not in the technical forms of it, but I contend\r\nfor it in the substance.\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings comes before your Lordships not as a British governor\r\nanswering to a British tribunal, but as a subahdar, as a bashaw of three\r\ntails. He says, \"I had an arbitrary power to exercise: I exercised it.\r\nSlaves I found the people: slaves they are,--they are so by their\r\nconstitution; and if they are, I did not make it for them. I was\r\nunfortunately bound to exercise this arbitrary power, and accordingly I\r\ndid exercise it. It was disagreeable to me, but I did exercise it; and\r\nno other power can be exercised in that country.\" This, if it be true,\r\nis a plea in bar. But I trust and hope your Lordships will not judge by\r\nlaws and institutions which you do not know, against those laws and\r\ninstitutions which you do know, and under whose power and authority Mr.\r\nHastings went out to India. Can your Lordships patiently hear what _we_\r\nhave heard with indignation enough, and what, if there were nothing\r\nelse, would call these principles, as well as the actions which are\r\njustified on such principles, to your Lordships' bar, that it may be\r\nknown whether the peers of England do not sympathize with the Commons in\r\ntheir detestation of such doctrine? Think of an English governor tried\r\nbefore you as a British subject, and yet declaring that he governed on\r\nthe principles of arbitrary power! His plea is, that he did govern there\r\non arbitrary and despotic, and, as he supposes, Oriental principles. And\r\nas this plea is boldly avowed and maintained, and as, no doubt, all his\r\nconduct was perfectly correspondent to these principles, the principles\r\nand the conduct must be tried together.\r\n\r\nIf your Lordships will now permit me, I will state one of the many\r\nplaces in which he has avowed these principles as the basis and\r\nfoundation of all his conduct. \"The sovereignty which they assumed, it\r\nfell to my lot, very unexpectedly, to exert; and whether or not such\r\npower, or powers of that nature, were delegated to me by any provisions\r\nof any act of Parliament, I confess myself too little of a lawyer to\r\npronounce. I only know that the acceptance of the sovereignty of\r\nBenares, &c., is not acknowledged or admitted by any act of Parliament;\r\nand yet, by the particular interference of the majority of the Council,\r\nthe Company is clearly and indisputably seized of that sovereignty.\" So\r\nthat this gentleman, because he is not a lawyer, nor clothed with those\r\nrobes which distinguish, and well distinguish, the learning of this\r\ncountry, is not to know anything of his duty; and whether he was bound\r\nby any, or what act of Parliament, is a thing he is not lawyer enough to\r\nknow! Now, if your Lordships will suffer the laws to be broken by those\r\nwho are not of the long robe, I am afraid those of the long robe will\r\nhave none to punish but those of their own profession. He therefore goes\r\nto a law he is better acquainted with,--that is, the law of arbitrary\r\npower and force, if it deserves to be called by the name of law. \"If,\r\ntherefore,\" says he, \"the _sovereignty_ of Benares, as ceded to us by\r\nthe Vizier, have _any rights whatever_ annexed to it, and be not a mere\r\nempty word without meaning, those rights must be such as are held,\r\ncountenanced, and established by the law, custom, and usage of the Mogul\r\nempire, and not by the provisions of any British act of Parliament\r\nhitherto enacted. _Those rights_, and none other, I have been the\r\ninvoluntary instrument of enforcing. And if any future act of Parliament\r\nshall positively or by implication tend to annihilate those very rights,\r\nor their exertion as I have exerted them, I much fear that the boasted\r\nsovereignty of Benares, which was held up as an acquisition, almost\r\nobtruded on the Company against my consent and opinion, (for I\r\nacknowledge that even then I foresaw many difficulties and\r\ninconveniences in its future exercise,)--I fear, I say, that this\r\nsovereignty will be found a burden instead of a benefit, a heavy clog\r\nrather than a precious gem to its present possessors: I mean, unless the\r\nwhole of our territory in that quarter shall be rounded and made an\r\nuniform compact body by one grand and systematic arrangement.--such an\r\narrangement as shall do away all the mischiefs, doubts, and\r\ninconveniences (both to the governors and the governed) arising from the\r\nvariety of tenures, rights, and claims in all cases of landed property\r\nand feudal jurisdiction in India, from the informality, invalidity, and\r\ninstability of all engagements in so divided and unsettled a state of\r\nsociety, and from the unavoidable anarchy and confusion of different\r\nlaws, religions, and prejudices, moral, civil, and political, all\r\njumbled together in one unnatural and discordant mass.\r\n\r\n\"Every part of Hindostan has been constantly exposed to these and\r\nsimilar disadvantages ever since the Mahomedan conquests. The Hindoos,\r\nwho never incorporated with their conquerors, were kept in order only by\r\nthe strong hand of power. The constant necessity of similar exertions\r\nwould increase at once their energy and extent; so that rebellion itself\r\nis the parent and promoter of despotism. Sovereignty in India implies\r\nnothing else. For I know not how we can form an estimate of its powers,\r\nbut from its visible effects; and those are everywhere the same, from\r\nCabool to Assam. The whole history of Asia is nothing more than\r\nprecedents to prove the invariable exercise of arbitrary power. To all\r\nthis I strongly alluded in the minutes I delivered in Council, when the\r\ntreaty with the new Vizier was on foot in 1775; and I wished to make\r\nCheyt Sing independent, because in India dependence included a thousand\r\nevils, many of which I enumerated at that time, and they are entered in\r\nthe ninth clause of the first section of this charge. I knew the powers\r\nwith which an Indian sovereignty is armed, and the dangers to which\r\ntributaries are exposed. I knew, that, from the history of Asia, and\r\nfrom the very nature of mankind, the subjects of a despotic empire are\r\nalways vigilant for the moment to rebel, and the sovereign is ever\r\njealous of rebellious intentions. A zemindar is an Indian subject, and\r\nas such exposed to the common lot of his fellows. _The mean and depraved\r\nstate of a mere zemindar_ is therefore this very dependence above\r\nmentioned on a despotic government, this very proneness to shake off his\r\nallegiance, and this very exposure to continual danger from his\r\nsovereign's jealousy, which are consequent on the political state of\r\nHindostanic governments. Bulwant Sing, if he had been, and Cheyt Sing,\r\nas long as he was a zemindar, stood exactly in this _mean and depraved\r\nstate_ by the constitution of his country. I did not make it for him,\r\nbut would have secured him from it. Those who made him a zemindar\r\nentailed upon him the consequences of so mean and depraved a tenure.\r\nAliverdy Khân and Cossim Ali fined all their zemindars on the\r\nnecessities of war, and on every pretence either of court necessity or\r\ncourt extravagance.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, you have now heard the principles on which Mr. Hastings\r\ngoverns the part of Asia subjected to the British empire. You have heard\r\nhis opinion of the mean and depraved state of those who are subject to\r\nit. You have heard his lecture upon arbitrary power, which he states to\r\nbe the constitution of Asia. You hear the application he makes of it;\r\nand you hear the practices which he employs to justify it, and who the\r\npersons were on whose authority he relies, and whose example he\r\nprofesses to follow. In the first place, your Lordships will be\r\nastonished at the audacity with which he speaks of his own\r\nadministration, as if he was reading a speculative lecture on the evils\r\nattendant upon some vicious system of foreign government in which he had\r\nno sort of concern whatsoever. And then, when in this speculative way he\r\nhas established, or thinks he has, the vices of the government, he\r\nconceives he has found a sufficient apology for his own crimes. And if\r\nhe violates the most solemn engagements, if he oppresses, extorts, and\r\nrobs, if he imprisons, confiscates, banishes at his sole will and\r\npleasure, when we accuse him for his ill-treatment of the people\r\ncommitted to him as a sacred trust, his defence is,--\"To be robbed,\r\nviolated, oppressed, is their privilege. Let the constitution of their\r\ncountry answer for it. I did not make it for them. Slaves I found them,\r\nand as slaves I have treated them. I was a despotic prince. Despotic\r\ngovernments are jealous, and the subjects prone to rebellion. This very\r\nproneness of the subject to shake off his allegiance exposes him to\r\ncontinual danger from his sovereign's jealousy, and this is consequent\r\non the political state of Hindostanic governments.\" He lays it down as a\r\nrule, that despotism is the genuine constitution of India, that a\r\ndisposition to rebellion in the subject or dependent prince is the\r\nnecessary effect of this despotism, and that jealousy and its\r\nconsequences naturally arise on the part of the sovereign,--that the\r\ngovernment is everything, and the subject nothing,--that the great\r\nlanded men are in a mean and depraved state, and subject to many evils.\r\n\r\nSuch a state of things, if true, would warrant conclusions directly\r\nopposite to those which Mr. Hastings means to draw from them, both\r\nargumentatively and practically, first to influence his conduct, and\r\nthen to bottom his defence of it.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you will imagine that the man who avows these principles of\r\narbitrary government, and pleads them as the justification of acts which\r\nnothing else can justify, is of opinion that they are on the whole good\r\nfor the people over whom they are exercised. The very reverse. He\r\nmentions them as horrible things, tending to inflict on the people a\r\nthousand evils, and to bring on the ruler a continual train of dangers.\r\nYet he states, that your acquisitions in India will be a detriment\r\ninstead of an advantage, if you destroy arbitrary power, unless you can\r\nreduce all the religious establishments, all the civil institutions, and\r\ntenures of land, into one uniform mass,--that is, unless by acts of\r\narbitrary power you extinguish all the laws, rights, and religious\r\nprinciples of the people, and force them to an uniformity, and on that\r\nuniformity build a system of arbitrary power.\r\n\r\nBut nothing is more false than that despotism is the constitution of any\r\ncountry in Asia that we are acquainted with. It is certainly not true of\r\nany Mahomedan constitution. But if it were, do your Lordships really\r\nthink that the nation would bear, that any human creature would bear, to\r\nhear an English governor defend himself on such principles? or, if he\r\ncan defend himself on such principles, is it possible to deny the\r\nconclusion, that no man in India has a security for anything, but by\r\nbeing totally independent of the British government? Here he has\r\ndeclared his opinion, that he is a despotic prince, that he is to use\r\narbitrary power; and of course all his acts are covered with that\r\nshield. \"_I know_,\" says he, \"_the constitution of Asia only from its\r\npractice_.\" Will your Lordships submit to hear the corrupt practices of\r\nmankind made the principles of government? No! it will be your pride\r\nand glory to teach men intrusted with power, that, in their use of it,\r\nthey are to conform to principles, and not to draw their principles from\r\nthe corrupt practice of any man whatever. Was there ever heard, or could\r\nit be conceived, that a governor would dare to heap up all the evil\r\npractices, all the cruelties, oppressions, extortions, corruptions,\r\nbriberies, of all the ferocious usurpers, desperate robbers, thieves,\r\ncheats, and jugglers, that ever had office, from one end of Asia to\r\nanother, and, consolidating all this mass of the crimes and absurdities\r\nof barbarous domination into one code, establish it as the whole duty of\r\nan English governor? I believe that till this time so audacious a thing\r\nwas never attempted by man.\r\n\r\n_He_ have arbitrary power! My Lords, the East India Company have not\r\narbitrary power to give him; the king has no arbitrary power to give\r\nhim; your Lordships have not; nor the Commons, nor the whole\r\nlegislature. We have no arbitrary power to give, because arbitrary power\r\nis a thing which neither any man can hold nor any man can give. No man\r\ncan lawfully govern himself according to his own will; much less can one\r\nperson be governed by the will of another. We are all born in\r\nsubjection,--all born equally, high and low, governors and governed, in\r\nsubjection to one great, immutable, preëxistent law, prior to all our\r\ndevices and prior to all our contrivances, paramount to all our ideas\r\nand all our sensations, antecedent to our very existence, by which we\r\nare knit and connected in the eternal frame of the universe, out of\r\nwhich we cannot stir.\r\n\r\nThis great law does not arise from our conventions or compacts; on the\r\ncontrary, it gives to our conventions and compacts all the force and\r\nsanction they can have. It does not arise from our vain institutions.\r\nEvery good gift is of God; all power is of God; and He who has given the\r\npower, and from whom alone it originates, will never suffer the exercise\r\nof it to be practised upon any less solid foundation than the power\r\nitself. If, then, all dominion of man over man is the effect of the\r\nDivine disposition, it is bound by the eternal laws of Him that gave it,\r\nwith which no human authority can dispense,--neither he that exercises\r\nit, nor even those who are subject to it; and if they were mad enough to\r\nmake an express compact that should release their magistrate from his\r\nduty, and should declare their lives, liberties, and properties\r\ndependent upon, not rules and laws, but his mere capricious will, that\r\ncovenant would be void. The acceptor of it has not his authority\r\nincreased, but he has his crime doubled. Therefore can it be imagined,\r\nif this be true, that He will suffer this great gift of government, the\r\ngreatest, the best, that was ever given by God to mankind, to be the\r\nplaything and the sport of the feeble will of a man, who, by a\r\nblasphemous, absurd, and petulant usurpation, would place his own\r\nfeeble, contemptible, ridiculous will in the place of the Divine wisdom\r\nand justice?\r\n\r\nThe title of conquest makes no difference at all. No conquest can give\r\nsuch a right; for conquest, that is, force, cannot convert its own\r\ninjustice into a just title, by which it may rule others at its\r\npleasure. By conquest, which is a more immediate designation of the hand\r\nof God, the conqueror succeeds to all the painful duties and\r\nsubordination to the power of God which belonged to the sovereign whom\r\nhe has displaced, just as if he had come in by the positive law of some\r\ndescent or some election. To this at least he is strictly bound: he\r\nought to govern them as he governs his own subjects. But every wise\r\nconqueror has gone much further than he was bound to go. It has been his\r\nambition and his policy to reconcile the vanquished to his fortune, to\r\nshow that they had gained by the change, to convert their momentary\r\nsuffering into a long benefit, and to draw from the humiliation of his\r\nenemies an accession to his own glory. This has been so constant a\r\npractice, that it is to repeat the histories of all politic conquerors\r\nin all nations and in all times; and I will not so much distrust your\r\nLordships' enlightened and discriminating studies and correct memories\r\nas to allude to one of them. I will only show you that the Court of\r\nDirectors, under whom he served, has adopted that idea,--that they\r\nconstantly inculcated it to him, and to all the servants,--that they run\r\na parallel between their own and the native government, and, supposing\r\nit to be very evil, did not hold it up as an example to be followed, but\r\nas an abuse to be corrected,--that they never made it a question,\r\nwhether India is to be improved by English law and liberty, or English\r\nlaw and liberty vitiated by Indian corruption.\r\n\r\nNo, my Lords, this arbitrary power is not to be had by conquest. Nor can\r\nany sovereign have it by succession; for no man can succeed to fraud,\r\nrapine, and violence. Neither by compact, covenant, or submission,--for\r\nmen cannot covenant themselves out of their rights and their\r\nduties,--nor by any other means, can arbitrary power be conveyed to any\r\nman. Those who give to others such rights perform acts that are void as\r\nthey are given,--good indeed and valid only as tending to subject\r\nthemselves, and those who act with them, to the Divine displeasure;\r\nbecause morally there can be no such power. Those who give and those who\r\nreceive arbitrary power are alike criminal; and there is no man but is\r\nbound to resist it to the best of his power, wherever it shall show its\r\nface to the world. It is a crime to bear it, when it can be rationally\r\nshaken off. Nothing but absolute impotence can justify men in not\r\nresisting it to the utmost of their ability.\r\n\r\nLaw and arbitrary power are in eternal enmity. Name me a magistrate, and\r\nI will name property; name me power, and I will name protection. It is a\r\ncontradiction in terms, it is blasphemy in religion, it is wickedness in\r\npolitics, to say that any man can have arbitrary power. In every patent\r\nof office the duty is included. For what else does a magistrate exist?\r\nTo suppose for power is an absurdity in idea. Judges are guided and\r\ngoverned by the eternal laws of justice, to which we are all subject. We\r\nmay bite our chains, if we will, but we shall be made to know ourselves,\r\nand be taught that man is born to be governed by law; and he that will\r\nsubstitute _will_ in the place of it is an enemy to GOD.\r\n\r\nDespotism does not in the smallest degree abrogate, alter, or lessen any\r\none duty of any one relation of life, or weaken the force or obligation\r\nof any one engagement or contract whatsoever. Despotism, if it means\r\nanything that is at all defensible, means a mode of government bound by\r\nno written rules, and coerced by no controlling magistracies or\r\nwell-settled orders in the state. But if it has no written law, it\r\nneither does nor can cancel the primeval, indefeasible, unalterable law\r\nof Nature and of nations; and if no magistracies control its exertions,\r\nthose exertions must derive their limitation and direction either from\r\nthe equity and moderation of the ruler, or from downright revolt on the\r\npart of the subject by rebellion, divested of all its criminal\r\nqualities. The moment a sovereign removes the idea of security and\r\nprotection from his subjects, and declares that he is everything and\r\nthey nothing, when he declares that no contract he makes with them can\r\nor ought to bind him, he then declares war upon them: he is no longer\r\nsovereign; they are no longer subjects.\r\n\r\nNo man, therefore, has a right to arbitrary power. But the thought which\r\nis suggested by the depravity of him who brings it forward is supported\r\nby a gross confusion of ideas and principles, which your Lordships well\r\nknow how to discern and separate. It is manifest, that, in the Eastern\r\ngovernments, and the Western, and in all governments, the supreme power\r\nin the state cannot, whilst that state subsists, be rendered criminally\r\nresponsible for its actions: otherwise it would not be the supreme\r\npower. It is certainly true: but the actions do not change their nature\r\nby losing their responsibility. The arbitrary acts which are unpunished\r\nare not the less vicious, though none but God, the conscience, and the\r\nopinions of mankind take cognizance of them.\r\n\r\nIt is not merely so in this or that government, but in all countries.\r\nThe king in this country is undoubtedly unaccountable for his actions.\r\nThe House of Lords, if it should ever exercise, (God forbid I should\r\nsuspect it would ever do what it has never done!)--but if it should ever\r\nabuse its judicial power, and give such a judgment as it ought not to\r\ngive, whether from fear of popular clamor on the one hand, or\r\npredilection to the prisoner on the other,--if they abuse their\r\njudgments, there is no calling them to an account for it. And so, if the\r\nCommons should abuse their power, nay, if they should have been so\r\ngreatly delinquent as not to have prosecuted this offender, they could\r\nnot be accountable for it; there is no punishing them for their acts,\r\nbecause we exercise a part of the supreme power. But are they less\r\ncriminal, less rebellious against the Divine Majesty? are they less\r\nhateful to man, whose opinions they ought to cultivate as far as they\r\nare just? No: till society fall into a state of dissolution, they cannot\r\nbe accountable for their acts. But it is from confounding the\r\nunaccountable character inherent in the supreme power with arbitrary\r\npower, that all this confusion of ideas has arisen.\r\n\r\nEven upon a supposition that arbitrary power can exist anywhere, which\r\nwe deny totally, and which your Lordships will be the first and proudest\r\nto deny, still, absolute supreme dominion was never conferred or\r\ndelegated by you,--much less, arbitrary power, which never did in any\r\ncase, nor ever will in any case, time, or country, produce any one of\r\nthe ends of just government.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the supreme power in every constitution of government\r\nmust be absolute, and this may be corrupted into the arbitrary. But all\r\ngood constitutions have established certain fixed rules for the exercise\r\nof their functions, which they rarely or ever depart from, and which\r\nrules form the security against that worst of evils, the government of\r\nwill and force instead of wisdom and justice.\r\n\r\nBut though the supreme power is in a situation resembling arbitrary, yet\r\nnever was there heard of in the history of the world, that is, in that\r\nmixed chaos of human wisdom and folly, such a thing as an _intermediate_\r\narbitrary power,--that is, of an officer of government who is to exert\r\nauthority over the people without any law at all, and who is to have the\r\nbenefit of all laws, and all forms of law, when he is called to an\r\naccount. For that is to let a wild beast (for such is a man without law)\r\nloose upon the people to prey on them at his pleasure, whilst all the\r\nlaws which ought to secure the people against the abuse of power are\r\nemployed to screen that abuse against the cries of the people.\r\n\r\nThis is _de facto_ the state of our Indian government. But to establish\r\nit so in right as well as in fact is a thing left for us to begin with,\r\nthe first of mankind. For a subordinate arbitrary or even despotic power\r\nnever was heard of in right, claim, or authorized practice; least of all\r\nhas it been heard of in the Eastern governments, where all the instances\r\nof severity and cruelty fall upon governors and persons intrusted with\r\npower. This would be a gross contradiction. Before Mr. Hastings, none\r\never came before his superiors to claim it; because, if any such thing\r\ncould exist, he claims the very power of that sovereign who calls him to\r\naccount.\r\n\r\nBut suppose a man to come before us, denying all the benefits of law to\r\nthe people under him,--and yet, when he is called to account, to claim\r\nall the benefits of that law which was made to screen mankind from the\r\nexcesses of power: such a claim, I will venture to say, is a monster\r\nthat never existed, except in the wild imagination of some theorist. It\r\ncannot be admitted, because it is a perversion of the fundamental\r\nprinciple, that every power given for the protection of the people below\r\nshould be responsible to the power above. It is to suppose that the\r\npeople shall have no laws with regard to _him_, yet, when _he_ comes to\r\nbe tried, he shall claim the protection of those laws which were made to\r\nsecure the people from his violence,--that he shall claim a fair trial,\r\nan equitable hearing, every advantage of counsel, (God forbid he should\r\nnot have them!) yet that the people under him shall have none of those\r\nadvantages. The reverse is the principle of every just and rational\r\nprocedure. For the people, who have nothing to use but their natural\r\nfaculties, ought to be gently dealt with; but those who are intrusted\r\nwith an artificial and instituted authority have in their hands a great\r\ndeal of the force of other people; and as their temptations to injustice\r\nare greater, so their moans are infinitely more effectual for mischief\r\nby turning the powers given for the preservation of society to its\r\ndestruction: so that, if an arbitrary procedure be justifiable, (a\r\nstrong one I am sure is,) it is when used against those who pretend to\r\nuse it against others.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, I will venture to say of the governments of Asia, that none of\r\nthem ever had an arbitrary power; and if any governments had an\r\narbitrary power, they cannot delegate it to any persons under them: that\r\nis, they cannot so delegate it to others as not to leave them\r\naccountable on the principles upon which it was given. As this is a\r\ncontradiction in terms, a gross absurdity, as well as a monstrous\r\nwickedness, let me say, for the honor of human nature, that, although\r\nundoubtedly we may speak it with the pride of England that we have\r\nbetter institutions for the preservation of the rights of men than any\r\nother country in the world, yet I will venture to say that no country\r\nhas wholly meant, or ever meant, to give this power.\r\n\r\nAs it cannot exist in right on any rational and solid principles of\r\ngovernment, so neither does it exist in the constitution of Oriental\r\ngovernments,--and I do insist upon it, that Oriental governments know\r\nnothing of arbitrary power. I have taken as much pains as I could to\r\nexamine into the constitutions of them. I have been endeavoring to\r\ninform myself at all times on this subject; of late my duty has led me\r\nto a more minute inspection of them; and I do challenge the whole race\r\nof man to show me any of the Oriental governors claiming to themselves a\r\nright to act by arbitrary will.\r\n\r\nThe greatest part of Asia is under Mahomedan governments. To name a\r\nMahomedan government is to name a government by law. It is a law\r\nenforced by stronger sanctions than any law that can bind a Christian\r\nsovereign. Their law is believed to be given by God; and it has the\r\ndouble sanction of law and of religion, with which the prince is no more\r\nauthorized to dispense than any one else. And if any man will produce\r\nthe Koran to me, and will but show me one text in it that authorizes in\r\nany degree an arbitrary power in the government, I will confess that I\r\nhave read that book, and been conversant in the affairs of Asia, in\r\nvain. There is not such a syllable in it; but, on the contrary, against\r\noppressors by name every letter of that law is fulminated. There are\r\ninterpreters established throughout all Asia to explain that law, an\r\norder of priesthood, whom they call _men of the law_. These men are\r\nconservators of the law; and to enable them to preserve it in its\r\nperfection, they are secured from the resentment of the sovereign: for\r\nhe cannot touch them. Even their kings are not always vested with a real\r\nsupreme power, but the government is in some degree republican.\r\n\r\nTo bring this point a little nearer home,--since we are challenged thus,\r\nsince we are led into Asia, since we are called upon to make good our\r\ncharge on the principles of the governments there, rather than on those\r\nof our own country, (which I trust your Lordships will oblige him\r\nfinally to be governed by, puffed up as he is with the insolence of\r\nAsia,)--the nearest to us of the governments he appeals to is that of\r\nthe Grand Seignior, the Emperor of the Turks.--_He_ an arbitrary power!\r\nWhy, he has not the supreme power of his own country. Every one knows\r\nthat the Grand Seignior is exalted high in _titles_, as our prerogative\r\nlawyers exalt an abstract sovereign,--and he cannot be exalted higher in\r\nour books. I say he is destitute of the first character of sovereign\r\npower: he cannot lay a tax upon his people. The next part in which he\r\nmisses of a sovereign power is, that he cannot dispose of the life, of\r\nthe property, or of the liberty of any of his subjects, but by what is\r\ncalled the _fetwah_, or sentence of the law. He cannot declare peace or\r\nwar without the same sentence of the law: so much is _he_, more than\r\nEuropean sovereigns, a subject of strict law, that he cannot declare war\r\nor peace without it. Then, if he can neither touch life nor property,\r\nif he cannot lay a tax on his subjects, or declare peace or war, I leave\r\nit to your Lordships' judgment, whether he can be called, according to\r\nthe principles of that constitution, an arbitrary power. A Turkish\r\nsovereign, if he should be judged by the body of that law to have acted\r\nagainst its principles, (unless he happens to be secured by a faction of\r\nthe soldiery,) is liable to be deposed on the sentence of that law, and\r\nhis successor comes in under the strict limitations of the ancient law\r\nof that country: neither can he hold his place, dispose of his\r\nsuccession, or take any one step whatever, without being bound by law.\r\nThus much may be said, when gentlemen talk of the affairs of Asia, as to\r\nthe nearest of Asiatic sovereigns: and he is more Asiatic than European,\r\nhe is a Mahomedan sovereign; and no Mahomedan is born who can exercise\r\nany arbitrary power at all, consistently with their constitution;\r\ninsomuch that this chief magistrate, who is the highest executive power\r\namong them, is the very person who, by the constitution of the country,\r\nis the most fettered by law.\r\n\r\nCorruption is the true cause of the loss of all the benefits of the\r\nconstitution of that country. The _practice of Asia_, as the gentleman\r\nat your bar has thought fit to say, is what he holds to; the\r\nconstitution he flies away from. The question is, whether you will take\r\nthe constitution of the country as your rule, or the base practices of\r\nthose usurpers, robbers, and tyrants who have subverted it. Undoubtedly,\r\nmuch blood, murder, false imprisonment, much peculation, cruelty, and\r\nrobbery are to be found in Asia; and if, instead of going to the sacred\r\nlaws of the country, he chooses to resort to the iniquitous practices of\r\nit, and practices authorized only by public tumult, contention, war, and\r\nriot, he may indeed find as clear an acquittal in the practices as he\r\nwould find condemnation in the institutions of it. He has rejected the\r\nlaw of England. Your Lordships will not suffer it. God forbid! For my\r\npart, I should have no sort of objection to let him choose his\r\nlaw,--Mahomedan, Tartarian, Gentoo. But if he disputes, as he does, the\r\nauthority of an act of Parliament, let him state to me that law to which\r\nhe means to be subject, or any law which he knows that will justify his\r\nactions. I am not authorized to say that I shall, even in that case,\r\ngive up what is not in me to give up, because I represent an authority\r\nof which I must stand in awe; but, for myself, I shall confess that I am\r\nbrought to public shame, and am not fit to manage the great interests\r\ncommitted to my charge. I therefore again repeat of that Asiatic\r\ngovernment with which we are best acquainted, which has been constituted\r\nmore in obedience to the laws of Mahomet than any other, that the\r\nsovereign cannot, agreeably to that constitution, exercise any arbitrary\r\npower whatever.\r\n\r\nThe next point for us to consider is, whether or no the Mahomedan\r\nconstitution of India authorizes that power. The gentleman at your\r\nLordships' bar has thought proper to say, that it will be happy for\r\nIndia, (though soon after he tells you it is an happiness they can never\r\nenjoy,) \"when the despotic institutes of Genghiz Khân or Tamerlane shall\r\ngive place to the liberal spirit of a British legislature; and,\" says\r\nhe, \"I shall be amply satisfied in my present prosecution, if it shall\r\ntend to hasten the approach of an event so beneficial to the great\r\ninterests of mankind.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, you have seen what he says about an act of Parliament. Do you\r\nnot now think it rather an extraordinary thing, that any British subject\r\nshould, in vindication of the authority which he has exercised, here\r\nquote the names and institutes, as he calls them, of fierce conquerors,\r\nof men who were the scourges of mankind, whose power was a power which\r\nthey held by force only?\r\n\r\nAs to the institutes of Genghiz Khân, which he calls arbitrary\r\ninstitutes, I never saw them. If he has that book, he will oblige the\r\npublic by producing it. I have seen a book existing, called Yassa of\r\nGenghiz Khân; the other I never saw. If there be any part of it to\r\njustify arbitrary power, he will produce it. But if we may judge by\r\nthose ten precepts of Genghiz Khân which we have, there is not a shadow\r\nof arbitrary power to be found in any one of them. Institutes of\r\narbitrary power! Why, if there is arbitrary power, there can be no\r\ninstitutes.\r\n\r\nAs to the institutes of Tamerlane, here they are in their original, and\r\nhere is a translation. I have carefully read every part of these\r\ninstitutes; and if any one shows me one word in them in which the prince\r\nclaims in himself arbitrary power, I again repeat, that I shall for my\r\nown part confess that I have brought myself to great shame. There is no\r\nbook in the world, I believe, which contains nobler, more just, more\r\nmanly, more pious principles of government than this book, called the\r\nInstitutions of Tamerlane. Nor is there one word of arbitrary power in\r\nit, much less of that arbitrary power which Mr. Hastings supposes\r\nhimself justified by,--namely, a delegated, subordinate, arbitrary\r\npower. So far was that great prince from permitting this gross, violent,\r\nintermediate arbitrary power, that I will venture to say the chief thing\r\nby which he has recommended himself to posterity was a most direct\r\ndeclaration of all the wrath and indignation of the supreme government\r\nagainst it. But here is the book. It contains the institutes of the\r\nfounder of the Mogul empire, left as a sacred legacy to his posterity,\r\nas a rule for their conduct, and as a means of preserving their power.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Be it known to my fortunate sons, the conquerors of kingdoms, to my\r\nmighty descendants, the lords of the earth, that, since I have hope in\r\nAlmighty God that many of my children, descendants, and posterity shall\r\nsit upon the throne of power and regal authority, upon this account,\r\nhaving established laws and regulations for the well governing of my\r\ndominions, I have collected together those regulations and laws as a\r\nmodel for others, to the end that, every one of my children,\r\ndescendants, and posterity acting agreeably thereto, my power and\r\nempire, which I acquired through hardships and difficulties and perils\r\nand bloodshed, by the Divine favor, and by the influence of the holy\r\nreligion of Mahomet, (God's peace be up on him!) and with the assistance\r\nof the powerful descendants and illustrious followers of that prophet,\r\nmay be by them preserved. And let them make these regulations the rule\r\nof their conduct in the affairs of their empire, that the fortune and\r\nthe power which shall descend from me to them may be safe from discord\r\nand dissolution.\r\n\r\n\"Now, therefore, be it known to my sons, the fortunate and the\r\nillustrious, to my descendants, the mighty subduers of kingdoms, that,\r\nin like manner as I by twelve maxims, which I established as the rule of\r\nmy conduct, attained to regal dignity, and with the assistance of these\r\nmaxims conquered and governed kingdoms, and decorated and adorned the\r\nthrone of my empire, let them also act according to these regulations,\r\nand preserve the splendor of mine and their dominions.\r\n\r\n\"And among the rules which I established for the support of my glory and\r\nempire, the _first_ was this,--that I promoted the worship of Almighty\r\nGod, and propagated the religion of the sacred Mahomet throughout the\r\nworld, and at all times and in all places supported the true faith.\r\n\r\n\"_Secondly_. With the people of the twelve classes and tribes I\r\nconquered and governed kingdoms, and with them I strengthened the\r\npillars of my fortune, and from them I formed my assembly.\r\n\r\n\"_Thirdly_. By consultation and deliberation and provident measures, by\r\ncaution and by vigilance, I vanquished armies, and I reduced kingdoms to\r\nmy authority. And I carried on the business of my empire by complying\r\nwith times and occasions, and by generosity, and by patience, and by\r\npolicy; and I acted with courteousness towards my friends and towards my\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\n\"_Fourthly_. By order and by discipline I regulated the concerns of my\r\ngovernment; and by discipline and by order I so firmly established my\r\nauthority, that the emirs and the viziers and the soldiers and the\r\nsubjects could not aspire beyond their respective degrees; and every one\r\nof them was the keeper of his own station.\r\n\r\n\"_Fifthly_. I gave encouragement to my emirs and to my soldiers, and\r\nwith money and with jewels I made them glad of heart; and I permitted\r\nthem to come into the banquet; and in the field of blood they hazarded\r\ntheir lives. And I withheld not from them my gold nor my silver. And I\r\neducated and trained them to arms; and to alleviate their sufferings, I\r\nmyself shared in their labors and in their hardships, until with the arm\r\nof fortitude and resolution, and with the unanimity of my chiefs and my\r\ngenerals and my warriors, by the edge of the sword, I obtained\r\npossession of the thrones of seven-and-twenty kings, and became the king\r\nand the ruler of the kingdoms of Eraun, and of Tooraun, and of Room, and\r\nof Mughrib, and of Shaum, and of Missur, and of Erauk-a-Arrub, and of\r\nAjjum, and of Mauzinduraun, and of Kylaunaut, and of Shurvaunaut, and of\r\nAzzurbauejaun, and of Fauris, and of Khorausaun, and of the Dusht of\r\nJitteh, and the Dusht of Kipchauk, and of Khauruzm, and Khuttun, and of\r\nKauboolistaun, and of Hindostaun, and of Bauktur Zemeen.\r\n\r\n\"And when I clothed myself in the robe of empire, I shut my eyes to\r\nsafety, and to the repose which is found on the bed of ease. And from\r\nthe twelfth year of my age I travelled over countries, and combated\r\ndifficulties, and formed enterprises, and vanquished armies, and\r\nexperienced mutinies amongst my officers and my soldiers, and was\r\nfamiliarized to the language of disobedience; and I opposed them with\r\npolicy and with fortitude, and I hazarded my person in the hour of\r\ndanger; until in the end I vanquished kingdoms and empires, and\r\nestablished the glory of my name.\r\n\r\n\"_Sixthly_. By justice and equity I gained the affections of the people\r\nof God; and I extended my clemency to the guilty as well as to the\r\ninnocent; and I passed that sentence which truth required; and by\r\nbenevolence I gained a place in the hearts of men; and by rewards and\r\npunishments I kept both my troops and my subjects divided between hope\r\nand fear. And I compassionated the lower ranks of my people, and those\r\nwho were distressed. And I gave gifts to the soldiers.\r\n\r\n\"And I delivered the oppressed from the hand of the oppressor; and after\r\nproof of the oppression, whether on the property or the person, the\r\ndecision which I passed between them was agreeable to the sacred law.\r\nAnd I did not cause any one person to suffer for the guilt of another.\r\n\r\n\"Those who had done me injuries, who had attacked my person in battle,\r\nand had counteracted my schemes and enterprises, when they threw\r\nthemselves on my mercy, I received them with kindness, I conferred on\r\nthem additional honors, and I drew the pen of oblivion over their evil\r\nactions; and I treated them in such sort, that, if suspicion remained in\r\ntheir hearts, it was plucked out entirely.\r\n\r\n\"_Seventhly_, I selected out, and treated with esteem and veneration,\r\nthe posterity of the Prophet, and the theologians, and the teachers of\r\nthe true faith, and the philosophers, and the historians. And I loved\r\nmen of courage and valor; for God Almighty loveth the brave. And I\r\nassociated with good and learned men; and I gained their affections, and\r\nI entreated their support, and I sought success from their holy prayers.\r\nAnd I loved the dervishes and the poor; and I oppressed them not,\r\nneither did I exclude them from my favor. And I permitted not the evil\r\nand the malevolent to enter into my council; and I acted not by their\r\nadvice; and I listened not to their insinuations to the prejudice of\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n\"_Eighthly_. I acted with resolution; and on whatever undertaking I\r\nresolved, I made that undertaking the only object of my attention; and I\r\nwithdrew not my hand from that enterprise, until I had brought it to a\r\nconclusion. And I acted according to that which I said. And I dealt not\r\nwith severity towards any one, and I was not oppressive in any of my\r\nactions; that God Almighty might not deal severely towards me, nor\r\nrender my own actions oppressive unto me.\r\n\r\n\"And I inquired of learned men into the laws and regulations of ancient\r\nprinces, from the days of Adam to those of the Prophet, and from the\r\ndays of the Prophet down to this time. And I weighed their institutions\r\nand their actions and their opinions, one by one. And from their\r\napproved manners and their good qualities I selected models. And I\r\ninquired into the causes of the subversion of their power, and I shunned\r\nthose actions which tend to the destruction and overthrow of regal\r\nauthority. And from cruelty and from oppression, which are the\r\ndestroyers of posterity and the bringers of famine and of plagues, I\r\nfound it was good to abstain.\r\n\r\n\"_Ninthly_. The situation of my people was known unto me. And those who\r\nwere great among them I considered as my brethren; and I regarded the\r\npoor as my children. And I made myself acquainted with the tempers and\r\nthe dispositions of the people of every country and of every city. And I\r\ncontracted intimacies with the citizens and the chiefs and the nobles;\r\nand I appointed over them governors adapted to their manners and their\r\ndispositions and their wishes. And I knew the circumstances of the\r\ninhabitants of every province. And in every kingdom I appointed writers\r\nof intelligence, men of truth and integrity, that they might send me\r\ninformation of the conduct and the behavior and the actions and the\r\nmanners of the troops and of the inhabitants, and of every occurrence\r\nthat might come to pass amongst them. And if I discovered aught contrary\r\nto their information, I inflicted punishment on the intelligencer; and\r\nevery circumstance of cruelty and oppression in the governors and in the\r\ntroops and in the inhabitants, which reached my ears, I chastised\r\nagreeably to justice and equity.\r\n\r\n\"_Tenthly_. Whatever tribe, and whatever horde, whether Toork, or\r\nTaucheek, or Arrub, or Ajjum, came in unto me, I received their chiefs\r\nwith distinction and respect, and their followers I honored according to\r\ntheir degrees and their stations; and to the good among them I did good,\r\nand the evil I delivered over to their evil actions.\r\n\r\n\"And whoever attached himself unto me, I forgot not the merit of his\r\nattachment, and I acted towards him with kindness and generosity; and\r\nwhoever had rendered me services, I repaid the value of those services\r\nunto him. And whoever had been my enemy, and was ashamed thereof, and,\r\nflying to me for protection, humbled himself before me, I forgot his\r\nenmity, and I purchased him with liberality and kindness.\r\n\r\n\"In such manner Share Behraum, the chief of a tribe, was along with me.\r\nAnd he left me in the hour of action, and he united with the enemy, and\r\nhe drew forth his sword against me. And at length my salt, which he had\r\neaten, seized upon him; and he again fled to me for refuge, and humbled\r\nhimself before me. As he was a man of illustrious descent, and of\r\nbravery, and of experience, I covered my eyes from his evil actions; and\r\nI magnified him, and I exalted him to a superior rank, and I pardoned\r\nhis disloyalty in consideration of his valor.\r\n\r\n\"_Eleventhly_. My children, and my relations, and my associates, and my\r\nneighbors, and such as had been connected with me, all these I\r\ndistinguished in the days of my fortune and prosperity, and I paid unto\r\nthem their due. And with respect to my family, I rent not asunder the\r\nbands of consanguinity and mercy; and I issued not commands to slay\r\nthem, or to bind them with chains.\r\n\r\n\"And I dealt with every man, whatever the judgment I had formed of him,\r\naccording to my own opinion of his worth. As I had seen much of\r\nprosperity and adversity, and had acquired knowledge and experience, I\r\nconducted myself with caution and with policy towards my friends and\r\ntowards my enemies.\r\n\r\n\"_Twelfthly_. Soldiers, whether associates or adversaries, I held in\r\nesteem,--those who sell their permanent happiness to perishable honor,\r\nand throw themselves into the field of slaughter and battle, and hazard\r\ntheir lives in the hour of danger.\r\n\r\n\"And the man who drew his sword on the side of my enemy, and committed\r\nhostilities against me, and preserved his fidelity to his master, him I\r\ngreatly honored; and when such a man came unto me, knowing his worth, I\r\nclassed him with my faithful associates; and I respected and valued his\r\nfidelity and his attachment.\r\n\r\n\"And the soldier who forgot his duty and his honor, and in the hour of\r\naction turned his face from his master, and came in unto me, I\r\nconsidered as the most detestable of men.\r\n\r\n\"And in the war between Touktummish Khaun, his emirs forgot their duty\r\nto Touktummish, who was their master and my foe, and sent proposals and\r\nwrote letters unto me. And I uttered execrations upon them, because,\r\nunmindful of that which they owed to their lord, they had thrown aside\r\ntheir honor and their duty, and came in unto me. I said unto myself,\r\n'What fidelity have they observed to their liege lord? what fidelity\r\nwill they show unto me?'\r\n\r\n\"And, behold, it was known unto me by experience, that every empire\r\nwhich is not established in morality and religion, nor strengthened by\r\nregulations and laws, from that empire all order, grandeur, and power\r\nshall pass away. And that empire may be likened unto a naked man, who,\r\nwhen exposed to view, commandeth the eye of modesty to be covered; and\r\nit is like unto a house which hath neither roof nor gates nor defences,\r\ninto which whoever willeth may enter unmolested.\r\n\r\n\"THEREFORE I established the foundation of my empire on the morality and\r\nthe religion of Islaum; and by regulations and laws I gave it stability.\r\nAnd by laws and by regulations I executed every business and every\r\ntransaction that came before me in the course of my government.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI need not read any further, or I might show your Lordships the noble\r\nprinciples, the grand, bold, and manly maxims, the resolution to abstain\r\nfrom oppression himself, and to crush it in the governors under him, to\r\nbe found in this book, which Mr. Hastings has thought proper to resort\r\nto as containing what he calls arbitrary principles.\r\n\r\nBut it is not in this instance only that I must do justice to the East.\r\nI assert that their morality is equal to ours, in whatever regards the\r\nduties of governors, fathers, and superiors; and I challenge the world\r\nto show in any modern European book more true morality and wisdom than\r\nis to be found in the writings of Asiatic men in high trust, and who\r\nhave been counsellors to princes. If this be the true morality of Asia,\r\nas I affirm and can prove that it is, the plea founded on Mr. Hastings's\r\ngeographical morality is annihilated.\r\n\r\nI little regard the theories of travellers, where they do not relate the\r\nfacts on which they are founded. I have two instances of facts attested\r\nby Tavernier, a traveller of power and consequence, which are very\r\nmaterial to be mentioned here, because they show that in some of the\r\ninstances recorded, in which the princes of the country have used any of\r\nthose cruel and barbarous executions which make us execrate them, it has\r\nbeen upon governors who have abused their trust,--and that this very\r\nOriental authority to which Mr. Hastings appeals would have condemned\r\nhim to a dreadful punishment. I thank God, and I say it from my heart,\r\nthat even for his enormous offences there neither is nor can be anything\r\nlike such punishments. God forbid that we should not as much detest\r\nout-of-the-way, mad, furious, and unequal punishments as we detest\r\nenormous and abominable crimes! because a severe and cruel penalty for a\r\ncrime of a light nature is as bad and iniquitous as the crime which it\r\npretends to punish. As the instances I allude to are curious, and as\r\nthey go to the principles of Mr. Hastings's defence, I shall beg to\r\nquote them.\r\n\r\nThe first is upon a governor who did what Mr. Hastings says he has a\r\npower delegated to him to do: he levied a tax without the consent of his\r\nmaster. \"Some years after my departure from Com,\" says Tavernier, \"the\r\ngovernor had, of his own accord, and without any communication with the\r\nking, laid a small impost upon every pannier of fruit brought into the\r\ncity, for the purpose of making some necessary reparations in the walls\r\nand bridges of the town. It was towards the end of the year 1632 that\r\nthe event I am going to relate happened. The king, being informed of the\r\nimpost which the governor had laid upon the fruit, ordered him to be\r\nbrought in chains to court. The king ordered him to be exposed to the\r\npeople at one of the gates of the palace; then he commanded the son to\r\npluck off the mustachios of his father, to cut off his nose and ears, to\r\nput out his eyes, and then cut off his head. The king then told the son\r\nto go and take possession of the government of his father, saying, _See\r\nthat you govern better than this deceased dog, or thy doom shall be a\r\ndeath more exquisitely tormenting_.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, you are struck with horror, I am struck with horror, at this\r\npunishment. I do not relate it to approve of such a barbarous act, but\r\nto prove to your Lordships, that, whatever power the princes of that\r\ncountry have, they are jealous of it to such a degree, that, if any of\r\ntheir governors should levy a tax, even the most insignificant, and for\r\nthe best purposes, he meets with a cruel punishment. I do not justify\r\nthe punishment; but the severity of it shows how little of their power\r\nthe princes of that country mean to delegate to their servants, the\r\nwhole of which the gentleman at your bar says was delegated to him.\r\n\r\nThere is another case, a very strong one, and that is the case of\r\npresents, which I understand is a custom admitted throughout Asia in all\r\ntheir governments. It was of a person who was raised to a high office;\r\nno business was suffered to come before him without a previous present.\r\n\"One morning, the king being at this time on a hunting party, the\r\n_nazar_ came to the tent of the king, but was denied entrance by the\r\n_meter_, or master of the wardrobe. About the same time the king came\r\nforth, and, seeing the nazar, commanded his officers to take off the\r\nbonnet from the head of that dog that took gifts from his people, and\r\nthat he should sit three days bareheaded in the heat of the sun, and as\r\nmany nights in the air. Afterwards he caused him to be chained about the\r\nneck and arms, and condemned him to perpetual imprisonment, with a\r\n_mamoudy_ a day for his maintenance; but he died for grief within eight\r\ndays after he was put in prison.\"\r\n\r\nDo I mean, by reading this to your Lordships, to express or intimate an\r\napprobation either of the cruelty of the punishment or of the coarse\r\nbarbarism of the language? Neither one nor the other. I produce it to\r\nyour Lordships to prove to you, from this dreadful example, the horror\r\nwhich that government felt, when any person subject to it assumed to\r\nhimself a privilege to receive presents. The cruelty and severity\r\nexercised by these princes is not levelled at the poor unfortunate\r\npeople who complain at their gates, but, to use their own barbarous\r\nexpression, _to dogs that impose taxes and take presents_. God forbid I\r\nshould use that language! The people, when they complain, are not called\r\ndogs and sent away, but the governors, who do these things against the\r\npeople: they are called dogs, and treated in that cruel manner. I quote\r\nthem to show that no governors in the East, upon any principle of their\r\nconstitution or any good practice of their government, can lay arbitrary\r\nimposts or receive presents. When they escape, it is probably by\r\nbribery, by corruption, by creating factions for themselves in the\r\nseraglio, in the country, in the army, in the divan. But how they escape\r\nsuch punishments is not my business to inquire; it is enough for me that\r\nthe constitution disavows them, that the princes of the country disavow\r\nthem,--that they revile them with the most horrible expressions, and\r\ninflict dreadful punishments on them, when they are called to answer for\r\nthese offences. Thus much concerning the Mahomedan laws of Asia. That\r\nthe people of Asia have no laws, rights, or liberty, is a doctrine that\r\nwickedly is to be disseminated through this country. But I again assert,\r\nevery Mahomedan government is, by its principles, a government of law.\r\n\r\nI shall now state, from what is known of the government of India, that\r\nit does not and cannot delegate, as Mr. Hastings has frequently\r\ndeclared, the whole of its powers and authority to him. If they are\r\nabsolute, as they must be in the supreme power, they ought to be\r\narbitrary in none; they were, however, never absolute in any of their\r\nsubordinate parts, and I will prove it by the known provincial\r\nconstitutions of Hindostan, which are all Mahomedan, the laws of which\r\nare as clear, as explicit, and as learned as ours.\r\n\r\nThe first foundation of their law is the _Koran_. The next part is the\r\n_Fetwah_, or adjudged cases by proper authority, well known there. The\r\nnext, the written interpretations of the principles of jurisprudence:\r\nand their books are as numerous upon the principles of jurisprudence as\r\nin any country in Europe. The next part of their law is what they call\r\nthe _Kanon_,--that is, a positive rule equivalent to acts of Parliament,\r\nthe law of the several powers of the country, taken from the Greek word\r\n[Greek: Kanôn], which was brought into their country, and is well known.\r\nThe next is the _Rawaj-ul-Mulk_, or common law and custom of the\r\nkingdom, equivalent to our common law. Therefore they have laws from\r\nmore sources than we have, exactly in the same order, grounded upon the\r\nsame authority, fundamentally fixed to be administered to the people\r\nupon these principles.\r\n\r\nThe next thing is to show that in India there is a partition of the\r\npowers of the government, which proves that there is no absolute power\r\ndelegated.\r\n\r\nIn every province the first person is the _Subahdar_ or _Nazim_, or\r\nViceroy: he has the power of the sword, and the administration of\r\ncriminal justice only. Then there is the _Dewan_, or High Steward: he\r\nhas the revenue and all exchequer causes under him, to be governed\r\naccording to the law and custom and institutions of the kingdom. The law\r\nof inheritances, successions, and everything that relates to them, is\r\nunder the _Cadi_, in whose court these matters are tried. But this, too,\r\nwas subdivided. The Cadi could not judge, but by the advice of his\r\nassessors. Properly in the Mahomedan law there is no appeal, only a\r\nremoval of the cause; but when there is no judgment, as none can be when\r\nthe court is not unanimous, it goes to the general assembly of all the\r\nmen of the law. There are, I will venture to say, other divisions and\r\nsubdivisions; for there are the _Kanongoes_, who hold their places for\r\nlife, to be the conservators of the canons, customs, and good usages of\r\nthe country: all these, as well as the Cadi and the Mufti, hold their\r\nplaces and situations, not during the wanton pleasure of the prince, but\r\non permanent and fixed terms for life. All these powers of magistracy,\r\nrevenue, and law are all different, consequently not delegated in the\r\nwhole to any one person.\r\n\r\nThis is the provincial constitution, and these the laws of Bengal; which\r\nproves, if there were no other proof, by the division of the functions\r\nand authorities, that the supreme power of the state in the Mogul empire\r\ndid by no means delegate to any of its officers the supreme power in its\r\nfulness. Whether or no we have delegated to Mr. Hastings the supreme\r\npower of King and Parliament, that he should act with the plenitude of\r\nauthority of the British legislature, you are to judge.\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings has no refuge here. Let him run from law to law; let him\r\nfly from the common law and the sacred institutions of the country in\r\nwhich he was born; let him fly from acts of Parliament, from which his\r\npower originated; let him plead his ignorance of them, or fly in the\r\nface of them. Will he fly to the Mahomedan law? That condemns him. Will\r\nhe fly to the high magistracy of Asia to defend taking of presents?\r\nPadishah and the Sultan would condemn him to a cruel death. Will he fly\r\nto the Sophis, to the laws of Persia, or to the practice of those\r\nmonarchs? I cannot utter the pains, the tortures, that would be\r\ninflicted on him, if he were to govern there as he has done in a British\r\nprovince. Let him fly where he will, from law to law; law, I thank God,\r\nmeets him everywhere, and enforced, too, by the practice of the most\r\nimpious tyrants, which he quotes as if it would justify his conduct. I\r\nwould as willingly have him tried by the law of the Koran, or the\r\nInstitutes of Tamerlane, as on the common law or statute law of this\r\nkingdom.\r\n\r\nThe next question is, whether the Gentoo laws justify arbitrary power:\r\nand if he finds any sanctuary there, let him take it, with the cow in\r\nthe pagoda. The Gentoos have a law which positively proscribes in\r\nmagistrates any idea of will,--a law with which, or rather with extracts\r\nof it, that gentleman himself has furnished us. These people in many\r\npoints are governed by their own ancient written law, called the\r\n_Shaster_. Its interpreters and judges are the _Pundits_. This law is\r\ncomprehensive, extending to all the concerns of life, affording\r\nprinciples and maxims and legal theories applicable to all cases, drawn\r\nfrom the sources of natural equity, modified by their institutions, full\r\nof refinement and subtilty of distinction equal to that of any other\r\nlaw, and has the grand test of all law, that, wherever it has prevailed,\r\nthe country has been populous, flourishing, and happy.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, then, follow him where you will, let him have Eastern or\r\nWestern law, you find everywhere arbitrary power and peculation of\r\ngovernors proscribed and horribly punished,--more so than I should ever\r\nwish to punish any, the most guilty, human creature. And if this be the\r\ncase, as I hope and trust it has been proved to your Lordships, that\r\nthere is law in these countries, that there is no delegation of power\r\nwhich exempts a governor from the law, then I say at any rate a British\r\ngovernor is to answer for his conduct, and cannot be justified by wicked\r\nexamples and profligate practices.\r\n\r\nBut another thing which he says is, that he was left to himself, to\r\ngovern himself by his own practice: that is to say, when he had taken\r\none bribe, he might take another; when he had robbed one man of his\r\nproperty, he might rob another; when he had imprisoned one man\r\narbitrarily, and extorted money from him, he might do so by another. He\r\nresorts at first to the practice of barbarians and usurpers; at last he\r\ncomes to his own. Now, if your Lordships will try him by such maxims and\r\nprinciples, he is certainly clear: for there is no manner of doubt that\r\nthere is nothing he has practised once which he has not practised again;\r\nand then the repetition of crimes becomes the means of his indemnity.\r\n\r\nThe next pleas he urges are not so much in bar of the impeachment as in\r\nextenuation. The first are to be laid by as claims to be made on motion\r\nfor arrest of judgment, the others as an extenuation or mitigation of\r\nhis fine. He says, and with a kind of triumph, \"The ministry of this\r\ncountry have great legal assistance,--commercial lights of the greatest\r\ncommercial city in the world,--the greatest generals and officers to\r\nguide and direct them in military affairs: whereas I, poor man, was sent\r\nalmost a school-boy from England, or at least little better,--sent to\r\nfind my way in that new world as well as I could. I had no men of the\r\nlaw, no legal assistance, to supply my deficiencies.\" _At Sphingem\r\nhabebas domi._ Had he not the chief-justice, the tamed and domesticated\r\nchief-justice, who waited on him like a familiar spirit, whom he takes\r\nfrom province to province, his amanuensis at home, his postilion and\r\nriding express abroad?\r\n\r\nSuch a declaration would in some measure suit persons who had acted much\r\notherwise than Mr. Hastings. When a man pleads ignorance in\r\njustification of his conduct, it ought to be an humble, modest,\r\nunpresuming ignorance, an ignorance which may have made him lax and\r\ntimid in the exercise of his duty; but an assuming, rash, presumptuous,\r\nconfident, daring, desperate, and disobedient ignorance heightens every\r\ncrime that it accompanies. Mr. Hastings, if through ignorance he left\r\nsome of the Company's orders unexecuted, because he did not understand\r\nthem, might well say, \"I was an ignorant man, and these things were\r\nabove my capacity.\" But when he understands them, and when he declares\r\nhe will not obey them, positively and dogmatically,--when he says, as he\r\nhas said, and we shall prove it, _that he never succeeds better than\r\nwhen he acts in an utter defiance of those orders_, and sets at nought\r\nthe laws of his country,--I believe this will not be thought the\r\nlanguage of an ignorant man. But I beg your Lordships' pardon: it is the\r\nlanguage of an ignorant man; for no man who was not full of a bold,\r\ndetermined, profligate ignorance could ever think of such a system of\r\ndefence. He quitted Westminster School almost a boy. We have reason to\r\nregret that he did not finish his education in that noble seminary,\r\nwhich has given so many luminaries to the Church and ornaments to the\r\nState. Greatly it is to be lamented that he did not go to those\r\nUniversities where arbitrary power will I hope never be heard of, but\r\nthe true principles of religion, of liberty, and law will ever be\r\ninculcated, instead of studying in the school of Cossim Ali Khân.\r\n\r\nIf he had lived with us, he would have quoted the example of Cicero in\r\nhis government, he would have quoted several of the sacred and holy\r\nprophets, and made _them_ his example. His want of learning, profane as\r\nwell as sacred, reduces him to the necessity of appealing to every name\r\nand authority of barbarism, tyranny, and usurpation that are to be\r\nfound; and from these he says, \"From the practice of one part of Asia or\r\nother I have taken my rule.\" But your Lordships will show him that in\r\nAsia as well as in Europe the same law of nations prevails, the same\r\nprinciples are continually resorted to, and the same maxims sacredly\r\nheld and strenuously maintained, and, however disobeyed, no man suffers\r\nfrom the breach of them who does not know how and where to complain of\r\nthat breach,--that Asia is enlightened in that respect as well as\r\nEurope; but if it were totally blinded, that England would send out\r\ngovernors to teach them better, and that he must justify himself to the\r\npiety, the truth, the faith of England, and not by having recourse to\r\nthe crimes and criminals of other countries, to the barbarous tyranny of\r\nAsia, or any other part of the world.\r\n\r\nI will go further with Mr. Hastings, and admit, that, if there be a boy\r\nin the fourth form of Westminster School, or any school in England, who\r\ndoes not know, when these articles are read to him, that he has been\r\nguilty of gross and enormous crimes, he may have the shelter of his\r\npresent plea, as far as it will serve him. There are none of us, thank\r\nGod, so uninstructed, who have learned our catechisms or the first\r\nelements of Christianity, who do not know that such conduct is not to be\r\njustified, and least of all by examples.\r\n\r\nThere is another topic he takes up more seriously, and as a general\r\nrebutter to the charge. Says he, \"After a great many of these practices\r\nwith which I am charged, Parliament appointed me to my trust, and\r\nconsequently has acquitted me.\"--Has it, my Lords? I am bold to say that\r\nthe Commons are wholly guiltless of this charge. I will admit, if\r\nParliament, on a full state of his offences before them, and full\r\nexamination of those offences, had appointed him to the government, that\r\nthen the people of India and England would have just reason to exclaim\r\nagainst so flagitious a proceeding. A sense of propriety and decorum\r\nmight have restrained us from prosecuting. They might have been\r\nrestrained by some sort of decorum from pursuing him criminally. But the\r\nCommons stand before your Lordships without shame. First, in their name\r\nwe solemnly assure your Lordships that we had not in our Parliamentary\r\ncapacity (and most of us, myself I can say surely, heard very little,\r\nand that in confused rumors) the slightest knowledge of any one of the\r\nacts charged upon this criminal at either of the times of his being\r\nappointed to office, and that we were not guilty of the nefarious act of\r\ncollusion and flagitious breach of trust with which he presumes\r\nobliquely to charge us; but from the moment we knew them, we never\r\nceased to condemn them by reports, by votes, by resolutions, and that we\r\nadmonished and declared it to be the duty of the Court of Directors to\r\ntake measures for his recall, and when frustrated in the way known to\r\nthat court we then proceeded to an inquiry. Your Lordships know whether\r\nyou were better informed. We are, therefore, neither guilty of the\r\nprecedent crime of colluding with the criminal, nor the subsequent\r\nindecorum of prosecuting what we had virtually and practically approved.\r\n\r\nSecondly, several of his worst crimes have been committed since the last\r\nParliamentary renewal of his trust, as appears by the dates in the\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\nBut I believe, my Lords, the judges--judges to others, grave and weighty\r\ncounsellors and assistants to your Lordships--will not, on reference,\r\nassert to your Lordships, (which God forbid, and we cannot conceive, or\r\nhardly state in argument, if but for argument,) that, if one of the\r\njudges had received bribes before his appointment to an higher judiciary\r\noffice, he would not still be open to prosecution.\r\n\r\nSo far from admitting it as a plea in bar, we charge, and we hope your\r\nLordships will find it an extreme aggravation of his offences, that no\r\nfavors heaped upon him could make him grateful, no renewed and repeated\r\ntrusts could make him faithful and honest.\r\n\r\nWe have now gone through most of the general topics.\r\n\r\nBut he is not responsible, as being thanked by the Court of Directors.\r\nHe has had the thanks and approbation of the India Company for his\r\nservices.--We know too well here, I trust the world knows, and you will\r\nalways assert, that a pardon from the crown is not pleadable here, that\r\nit cannot bar the impeachment of the Commons,--much less a pardon of the\r\nEast India Company, though it may involve them in guilt which might\r\ninduce us to punish them for such a pardon. If any corporation by\r\ncollusion with criminals refuse to do their duty in coercing them, the\r\nmagistrates are answerable.\r\n\r\nIt is the use, virtue, and efficacy of Parliamentary judicial procedure,\r\nthat it puts an end to this dominion of faction, intrigue, cabal, and\r\nclandestine intelligences. The acts of men are put to their proper test,\r\nand the works of darkness tried in the face of day,--not the corrupted\r\nopinions of others on them, but their own intrinsic merits. We charge it\r\nas his crime, that he bribed the Court of Directors to thank him for\r\nwhat they had condemned as breaches of his duty.\r\n\r\nThe East India Company, it is true, have thanked him. They ought not to\r\nhave done it; and it is a reflection upon their character that they did\r\nit. But the Directors praise him in the gross, after having condemned\r\neach act in detail. His actions are _all_, every one, censured one by\r\none as they arise. I do not recollect any one transaction, few there\r\nare, I am sure, in the whole body of that succession of crimes now\r\nbrought before you for your judgment, in which the India Company have\r\nnot censured him. Nay, in one instance he pleads their censure in bar of\r\nthis trial;[27] for he says, \"In that censure I have already received my\r\npunishment.\" If, for any other reasons, they come and say, \"We thank\r\nyou, Sir, for all your services,\" to that I answer, Yes; and _I_ would\r\nthank him for his services, too, if I knew them. But _I_ do\r\nnot;--perhaps _they_ do. Let them thank him for those services. I am\r\nordered to prosecute him for these crimes. Here, therefore, we are on a\r\nbalance with the India Company; and your Lordships may perhaps think it\r\nsome addition to his crimes, that he has found means to obtain the\r\nthanks of the India Company for the whole of his conduct, at the same\r\ntime that their records are full of constant, uniform, particular\r\ncensure and reprobation of every one of those acts for which he now\r\nstands accused.\r\n\r\nHe says, there is the testimony of Indian princes in his favor. But do\r\nwe not know how seals are obtained in that country? Do we not know how\r\nthose princes are imposed upon? Do we not know the subjection and\r\nthraldom in which they are held, and that they are obliged to return\r\nthanks for the sufferings which they have felt? I believe your Lordships\r\nwill think that there is not, with regard to some of these princes, a\r\nmore dreadful thing that can be said of them than that he has obtained\r\ntheir thanks.\r\n\r\nI understand he has obtained the thanks of the miserable Princesses of\r\nOude, whom he has cruelly imprisoned, whose treasure he has seized, and\r\nwhose eunuchs he has tortured.[28] They thank him for going away; they\r\nthank him for leaving them the smallest trifle of their subsistence; and\r\nI venture to say, if he wanted a hundred more panegyrics, provided he\r\nnever came again among them, he might have them. I understand that\r\nMahdajee Sindia has made his panegyric, too. Mahdajee Sindia has not\r\nmade his panegyric for nothing; for, if your Lordships will suffer him\r\nto enter into such a justification, we shall prove that he has\r\nsacrificed the dignity of this country and the interests of all its\r\nallies to that prince. We appear here neither with panegyric nor with\r\nsatire; it is for substantial crimes we bring him before you, and\r\namongst others for cruelly using persons of the highest rank and\r\nconsideration in India; and when we prove he has cruelly injured them,\r\nyou will think the panegyrics either gross forgeries or most miserable\r\naggravations of his offences, since they show the abject and dreadful\r\nstate into which he has driven those people. For let it be proved that I\r\nhave cruelly robbed and maltreated any persons, if I produce a\r\ncertificate from them of my good behavior, would it not be a\r\ncorroborative proof of the terror into which those persons are thrown by\r\nmy misconduct?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy Lords, these are, I believe, the general grounds of our charge. I\r\nhave now closed completely, and I hope to your Lordships' satisfaction,\r\nthe whole body of history of which I wished to put your Lordships in\r\npossession. I do not mean that many of your Lordships may not have known\r\nit more perfectly by your own previous inquiries; but, bringing to your\r\nremembrance the state of the circumstances of the persons with whom he\r\nacted, the persons and power he has abused, I have gone to the\r\nprinciples he maintains, the precedents he quotes, the laws and\r\nauthorities which he refuses to abide by, and those on which he relies;\r\nand at last I have refuted all those pleas in bar on which he depends,\r\nand for the effect of which he presumes on the indulgence and patience\r\nof this country, or on the corruption of some persons in it. And here I\r\nclose what I had to say upon this subject,--wishing and hoping, that,\r\nwhen I open before your Lordships the case more particularly, so as to\r\nstate rather a plan of the proceeding than the direct proof of the\r\ncrimes, your Lordships will hear me with the same goodness and\r\nindulgence I have hitherto experienced,--that you will consider, if I\r\nhave detained you long, it was not with a view of exhausting my own\r\nstrength, or putting your patience to too severe a trial, but from the\r\nsense I feel that it is the most difficult and the most complicated\r\ncause that was ever brought before any human tribunal. Therefore I was\r\nresolved to bring the whole substantially before you. And now, if your\r\nLordships will permit me, I will state the method of my future\r\nproceeding, and the future proceeding of the gentlemen assisting me.\r\n\r\nI mean first to bring before you the crimes as they are classed, and are\r\nof the same species and genus, and how they mutually arose from one\r\nanother. I shall first show that Mr. Hastings's crimes had root in that\r\nwhich is the root of all evil, I mean avarice; that avarice and rapacity\r\nwere the groundwork and foundation of all his other vicious system; that\r\nhe showed it in setting to sale the native government of the country, in\r\nsetting to sale the whole landed interest of the country, in setting to\r\nsale the British government and his own fellow-servants, to the basest\r\nand wickedest of mankind.\r\n\r\nI shall then show your Lordships, that, when, in consequence of such a\r\nbody of corruption and peculation, he justly dreaded the indignation of\r\nhis country and the vengeance of its laws, in order to raise himself a\r\nfaction embodied by the same guilt and rewarded in the same manner, he\r\nhas, with a most abandoned profusion, thrown away the revenues of the\r\ncountry to form such a faction here.\r\n\r\nI shall next show your Lordships, that, having exhausted the resources\r\nof the Company, and brought it to extreme difficulties within, he has\r\nlooked to his _external_ resources, as he calls them; he has gone up\r\ninto the country. I will show that he has plundered, or attempted to\r\nplunder, every person dependent upon, connected, or allied with this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nWe shall afterwards show what infinite mischief has followed in the case\r\nof Benares, upon which he first laid his hands; next, in the case of the\r\nBegums of Oude.\r\n\r\nWe shall then lay before you the profligate system by which he\r\nendeavored to oppress that country: first by Residents; next by spies\r\nunder the name of British Agents; and lastly, that, pursuing his way up\r\nto the mountains, he has found out one miserable chief, whose crimes\r\nwere the prosperity of his country,--that him he endeavored to torture\r\nand destroy,--I do not mean in his body, but by exhausting the treasures\r\nwhich he kept for the benefit of his people.\r\n\r\nIn short, having shown your Lordships that no man who is in his power is\r\nsafe from his arbitrary will,--that no man, within or without, friend,\r\nally, rival, has been safe from him,--having brought it to this point,\r\nif I am not able in my own person immediately to go up into the country\r\nand show the ramifications of the system, (I hope and trust I shall be\r\nspared to take my part in pursuing him through both,) if I am not, I\r\nshall go at least to the root of it, and some other gentleman, with a\r\nthousand times more ability than I possess, will take up each separate\r\npart in its proper order. And I believe it is proposed by the managers\r\nthat one of them shall as soon as possible begin with the affair of\r\nBenares.\r\n\r\nThe point I now mean first to bring before your Lordships is the\r\ncorruption of Mr. Hastings, his system of peculation and bribery, and to\r\nshow your Lordships the horrible consequences which resulted from it:\r\nfor, at first sight, bribery and peculation do not seem to be so horrid\r\na matter; they may seem to be only the transferring a little money out\r\nof one pocket into another; but I shall show that by such a system of\r\nbribery the country is undone.\r\n\r\nI shall inform your Lordships in the best manner I can, and afterwards\r\nsubmit the whole, as I do with a cheerful heart and with an easy and\r\nassured security, to that justice which is the security for all the\r\nother justice in the kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] 2d year of George II.\r\n\r\n[2] See his letter of the 11th of July, 1785, at the end of the Charges.\r\n\r\n[3] 13 Geo.
