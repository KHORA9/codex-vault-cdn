I had to\r\ngo back to the beginning of this idea, and to extend the meaning of\r\n“Zionism” to all aspirations and efforts tending in the same direction.\r\nThere was in these aspirations, undoubtedly, a diversity of reasons\r\nand methods which continues to this day. It is the object of the\r\npresent work to trace these various currents of the idea so that the\r\nreader, passing from period to period, and from section to section,\r\nmay become acquainted with their relative value and their influence\r\nupon one another.\r\n\r\nIn this book I have striven more especially to consider the attitude\r\nof the English people towards Zionism, as revealed in the political\r\nhistory and in the literature of England. The Christian religious idea\r\nof the Restoration of _Israel_ having been a subject of pre-eminent\r\ninterest and importance and an influential factor in shaping public\r\nopinion in this country for many generations, the greatest care has\r\nbeen bestowed upon the investigation of this aspect, no less than\r\non that relating to the support and encouragement which Zionism has\r\nreceived in England and in France merely on humanitarian or political\r\ngrounds, apart from religious aspirations.\r\n\r\nWhile tracing in detail the growth of these sympathies, I have\r\nendeavoured to throw some light on the motives and sentiments\r\nappertaining to the most significant instances on record. I had,\r\ntherefore, to deal with a great variety of subjects which, at first\r\nsight, may seem somewhat remote from the main object of this book,\r\nbut are after all closely connected with it, as for instance:――\r\n\r\n  The Biblical character of the English People;\r\n  The Bible in English Literature;\r\n  The Love for Palestine in England, and\r\n  English Politics in the Near East.\r\n\r\nConcerning the last-mentioned subject, it is perhaps necessary to\r\nexplain why I was compelled to deal at such length with the Wars\r\nand Treaties of 1839‒40, of 1853‒54, and _The Lebanon_ events of\r\n1860, _etc._ It can hardly be too often repeated that Zionism has to\r\nconsider political conditions, and that its realization depends much\r\non the general political situation. It is for this reason that it\r\nis necessary to devote much attention to all the events which have\r\nmore or less determined English policy, and have influenced――in\r\na favourable or unfavourable manner――the evolution of the Zionist\r\nidea. The events of 1839‒40, for instance, were responsible for the\r\nextension of English protection to Palestinian Jews; those of 1853‒54\r\ncaused a revival of Zionist schemes: _The Lebanon_ developments of\r\n1860‒61 created a precedent in Syria for the Charter which modern\r\nZionism included in its programme; while England’s engagements in the\r\nNear East in 1878 and 1882 on the one hand, and the Turkish Revolution\r\nof 1908 on the other hand, both of which, in different ways, led to\r\nthe idea of a rejuvenation of the East, indicate the possible course\r\nof future events.\r\n\r\nTaking the same view with regard to Zionism among the Jews themselves,\r\nI had to deal with the expression of different aspirations of that\r\ncharacter in their successive and gradual evolution, no matter how\r\nthey were named. From what is stated in the following pages, it is\r\nobvious that Messianic traditions and hopes led to the efforts put\r\nforth for the colonization of Palestine; but it is also evident that\r\ncolonization requires political guarantees. Modern Zionism cannot be\r\nfully understood without the movement of the _Chovevé Zion_ = Lovers\r\nof _Zion_, neither can it be properly appreciated without a knowledge\r\nof the influence of _Hebrew_ literature, national propaganda, the\r\nmovement at the Universities, and other preparatory agencies of great\r\nimportance. Some readers will be more or less familiar with the most\r\nimportant events in connection with the Zionist Organization, but\r\nso far as I have been able to discover there are very few Zionists\r\nwho have ever endeavoured to trace the history of the Idea. Hence,\r\nwhile the Zionist Organization and its institutions have, naturally,\r\nreceived special attention, an exhaustive examination of the history\r\nof the Zionist Idea has been no less necessary. The fact should not be\r\noverlooked that Zionism has its external and its internal aspects, its\r\nmaterial realities as well as its spiritual character; and that the\r\noutward form of Zionism is the consequence and not the cause of the\r\ninner spirit. A real knowledge of Zionism presupposes an acquaintance\r\nwith its intellectual sources. I felt, consequently, that a history of\r\nZionism on broad lines must include a survey of the creative forces\r\nunderlying the Zionist Idea.\r\n\r\nIn writing the history of Zionism as evolved principally in England\r\nand France, I do not intend to imply that the history of Zionism in\r\nany other country is unworthy of study. A history of Zionism in other\r\ncountries would, no doubt, prove of the greatest interest. But it will\r\nbe apparent that in England the Zionist idea has the oldest records,\r\nwhile as far as practical help for colonization is concerned, France\r\nis the great centre. In view, however, of the world-wide character of\r\nthe Zionist Movement, I could not confine myself exclusively to these\r\ntwo countries, and had to deal briefly with such subjects as Zionist\r\nliterature, colonization work, Zionism at the Universities, and the\r\nZionist Organization in Palestine, Russia, and other countries.\r\n\r\nIn a single book, which deals with a vast mass of facts and with\r\nrecords extending over a period of nearly three centuries, it is\r\nimpossible to do more than indicate in very general terms the nature\r\nof the different currents and variations of the fundamental Zionist\r\nidea. It would be a tedious, and indeed an impossible task, to attempt\r\na full examination of the mass of material accessible in the form\r\nof literature and personal reminiscences. It would require several\r\nvolumes. While, then, the magnitude of the subject prevents me from\r\nattempting to present my case with absolute completeness within the\r\nlimits of this work, nevertheless it is sufficiently important to\r\njustify the endeavour to summarize its most prominent features. I\r\nshall indeed be thankful if my work succeeds in disposing of the most\r\nimportant points I touch upon. This book has not been written with\r\na view to Zionist propaganda among the masses. But the propagandist\r\nmay be able to make use of some of the material and reproduce it in\r\npopular articles and pamphlets. The book may also prove of interest\r\nto those who have the will and the patience to study the problem of\r\nZionism more deeply. Students with the inclination to examine more\r\nclosely into the subject will find the necessary indications in the\r\ntext, as well as in the Appendices and the Indexes.\r\n\r\nI have spared no pains in my endeavour to obtain the best sources of\r\ninformation and to secure accuracy, and have also made every effort\r\nto consult all the literature bearing upon the subject, making liberal\r\nuse of all material accessible to me. I have given the authorities\r\nfor my statements wherever possible, so that those who may be desirous\r\nof investigating the subject more fully may have an opportunity of\r\njudging for themselves as to the credibility of the evidence upon\r\nwhich my conclusions are based. It is almost certain, however, that\r\nsmall mistakes have crept in occasionally, and I shall be grateful\r\nfor any corrections which may at any time be indicated to me by\r\nreaders. This will be particularly the case with regard to the records\r\ndealing with the workers in the various countries, the movement at\r\nthe Universities, and so forth. It was in some instances difficult\r\nto select names, and I have been under the necessity of omitting some\r\njust as important as those which I have recorded. And in connection\r\nwith this part of my work I had very little literature, and it is\r\nquite possible that my memory has failed me in respect of the order\r\nand details of certain facts and events. But I hope that such errors\r\ncan be easily corrected.\r\n\r\nAs regards general treatment, the subject presented the usual\r\ndifficulty in the choice of a chronological or analytical method.\r\nIn a strict chronological arrangement things of a similar character\r\nwould often be widely separated, and the chain recording a certain\r\ndevelopment would be broken. In the other arrangement the points\r\nappertaining to the influence of a particular period would be obscured,\r\nand the survey rendered difficult. I have therefore combined as far as\r\npossible the advantages of both methods, and have endeavoured to avoid\r\ntheir drawbacks. I have arranged the material chronologically for\r\nevery subject, but in order to explain activities connected with one\r\nanother, I have often had to take a retrospective glance at an episode\r\nor a personality.\r\n\r\nThe elucidation of Zionist aims, with special reference to the present\r\nsituation, is, apart from several allusions to it in the text of\r\nthe present volume, mainly dealt with in the Introduction. The whole\r\nhistory, and particularly the Introduction, is, as I am perfectly\r\naware, written from the Zionist standpoint. A historian should, it\r\nis true, put aside party interest. But nobody not himself a Zionist\r\ncould penetrate into the kernel of Zionism, because one cannot fully\r\ncomprehend any spiritual phenomenon without feeling it within himself.\r\nThose who have no experience in Zionism may have their opinions, but\r\nthey are invariably found to be ignorant of the more minute features\r\nand finer points which are essential to a faithful portrayal of\r\nZionism. Zionists, on the other hand, may be partial, but they are\r\ncertainly better informed. Anyhow, I have endeavoured to be just to\r\nthe best of my ability.\r\n\r\nTo Zionists themselves this history needs no recommendation. The\r\nrecords of an ideal of thousands of years for which the best of our\r\nnation have laboured, struggled, suffered and died cannot fail to\r\ninterest most profoundly those who have inherited their principles and\r\ncontinue their work, thoroughly convinced that it is in harmony with\r\nhumanity and justice, as well as with Jewish tradition.\r\n\r\nHaving said so much, I need only add one word of explanation\r\nconcerning the term “Jewish Nationalism,” which is frequently\r\nused in this book. “Nationalism,” generally speaking, is a modern\r\ndescription of certain political parties and schools, which stand for\r\nan exaggerated racial self-consciousness. It is difficult to define\r\nthis word without importing into our thought the idea of the contrast\r\nbetween broad-minded humanity and tribal or national exclusiveness and\r\nhostility towards other nations. This, however, would be an extremely\r\nunfair rendering of what we call “Nationalism” in relation to the Jews.\r\nIn the present book, as indeed in the whole of Zionist literature,\r\nthe word is used without any reference to narrow-minded exclusiveness,\r\nand it stands only for the recognition of the national character of\r\nthe Jews in so far as they are an ethnic, historic, and cultural unit\r\nin the Diaspora, and in so far as they aim at a revival of their full\r\nnational life in the land of their fathers. Obviously, this idea has\r\nnothing in common with what is usually called “Nationalism.” This\r\ndistinction must always be borne in mind.\r\n\r\nIt is now my pleasant duty to express my grateful acknowledgments to\r\ncolleagues and friends who have so generously and zealously assisted\r\nme in the preparation of this work.\r\n\r\nMr. Elkan N. Adler has kindly allowed me to take extracts from the\r\ncorrespondence that passed between his father, the Very Reverend Chief\r\n_Rabbi_ Dr. Nathan Marcus Adler, and Sir Moses Montefiore, Bart.,\r\nconcerning the Holy Land.\r\n\r\nMr. Leon Simon has made many valuable suggestions, and most generously\r\ndevoted considerable time to the reading and correcting the proofs.\r\n\r\nI am, however, particularly indebted to Mr. Israel Solomons, who\r\nrevised the chapters of the first volume, added considerably to the\r\nbiographical and bibliographical details, and volunteered to see the\r\nwork through the press.\r\n\r\nHe also placed at my disposal his unique collection of books and\r\ntracts on Anglo-Judaica, and having decided to illustrate the book,\r\nhe generously undertook this part of the work, giving me the benefit\r\nof his great knowledge and experience and furnishing from his many\r\nportfolios rare portraits and other engravings. He also devoted\r\nmuch time and energy in procuring from sources far and wide the\r\nillustrations deemed necessary, when not in his own collection.\r\n\r\n                                                            N.

On the one hand there\r\nis nothing in Zionism which is not more or less found elsewhere. The\r\nPromised Land, Jewish national distinctiveness, the future of the\r\nJewish people――these ideas exist in Judaism and in Christianity. They\r\ngo back to the remotest past; they take, during many generations, a\r\nthousand forms――sentimental, practical, sublime, even mystical. In\r\nModern Zionism we find them all. On the other hand, while the elements\r\nof the older Zionism seem familiar, the total effect of Modern Zionism\r\nis that of something new and strange. The reason is that there is\r\nsomething in Modern Zionism which stamps it as unique, and raises\r\nit far above all older ideas and aspirations. Some of the old ideas\r\nof the Middle Ages about the restoration of Israel would nowadays\r\nbe hardly acceptable. But the same ideas, when we see great masses\r\nof Jews inspired by them and aiming at their realization, become\r\nattractive. The same holds good as regards details.\r\n\r\nIn the Zionist programme every point of the old Zionist idea is\r\npreserved, but everything is modernized. Modern Zionism is the\r\nlogical consequence of Jewish History. It does not appeal merely to\r\nold memories, which, however noble and moving, cannot be permanently\r\nsustained; it works by simple, intelligible means, by means of a\r\nRenascence. This Renascence kindles enthusiasm, renews courage,\r\nawakens in the heart fresh fervour and stimulus to action.\r\n\r\nZionism has tradition to support it; but if it were simply a thing\r\nof antiquity, it would perish; if it were simply a matter of history\r\nand not of living experience, it would be relegated to the sphere\r\nof archæology. Zionism, although old, like the Jewish people, thinks\r\nfreshly and independently on Jewish subjects. The roots of Zionism are\r\nin the past, but its blossom is in the present and its fruit in the\r\nfuture. The reason is simply that everything really Jewish must be\r\nbound up with history. Zionism is, first of all, undoubtedly a great\r\nhistorical idea. It is a simple matter of fact that Israel’s history\r\nbegins with Zionism. Israel’s history in ancient times shows the path\r\nto the realization of Zionism. The exodus from Egypt was an example\r\nof combined emigration and colonization. The Jewish people entered\r\nCanaan, occupied lands, and in a few generations became a glorious\r\nnation. The return from Babylon was a great Zionist event, without\r\nany supernatural miracle, dependent only on the grace of God and the\r\napproval of Cyrus the Great. The Jews who returned from Babylon were\r\nonly an insignificant minority in numbers, but they were inspired,\r\nand therefore they succeeded in founding a centre, and that centre,\r\nPalestine, became a new light for Jews and Gentiles. In fact, the\r\nfavourite idea of Modern Zionism, the idea of a spiritual centre in\r\nZion for the whole Diaspora, the focussing of a pure Jewish life in\r\nPalestine, the creation of an intellectual and moral reservoir, from\r\nwhich a stream of influence should flow all over the scattered nation,\r\nand waves of Jewish inspiration and knowledge should spread in all\r\ndirections, making the little land a metropolis of Judaism in religion\r\nand life――was not this Zionist programme laid down and carried out in\r\nthe intentions and achievements of _Zerubbabel, Ezra and Nehemiah_?\r\n\r\nIn after years Jews went forth as emigrants to all parts of the world.\r\nThey submitted to the laws of the various countries, and were capable\r\nof adapting themselves to surrounding circumstances. Wherever they\r\nwent they carried with them their God and their traditions, their\r\nliterature and their customs, nor did they ever forget the old, holy\r\nhome which they had left.\r\n\r\nThis faithfulness is one of the most stirring and pathetic facts in\r\nthe history of the world; it is the most sublime fact in the history\r\nof the Jews. The Jews never forgot _Jerusalem_, its ruined walls, its\r\nshattered palaces, its former grandeur, its old associations; they\r\nnever forgot the old land and its desolate fields. This feeling never\r\ndepended on individual Jews, it depended on the whole Jewish nation.\r\n\r\nThe Jews never forgot their old nationality. They never forgot that\r\nthey were a nation apart, distinct in morality, in learning, in\r\nliterature, in social arrangements and in agriculture: a civilized\r\nnation at a time when Western civilization was still unknown. For two\r\nthousand years after the loss of political independence, they believed\r\nwith passionate intensity in their future as a nation in Palestine.\r\nWhile they were mingling with the world around them, no temptation,\r\nwhether the hope of material success or the still more irresistible\r\nforce of emulation, could withdraw them from their allegiance to the\r\nfuture. No inducement, however powerful, no suffering, no martyrdom,\r\nno agony could make them forget the sacred debt they owed to God, to\r\ntheir ancestors and to themselves. They always considered it their\r\nduty to be members of one great family, bound together not alone\r\nby a common past, but by a community of undying ideas, aspirations,\r\nand hopes for a national future. They remained unmistakably true to\r\ntheir duty. This strong conviction is deeply rooted in the hearts of\r\nmillions of Jews. It is an unbroken chain stretching from the dawn of\r\nJewish history through all generations from _Abraham_ to our own times.\r\nThis unshaken belief, which kept and still keeps together the Jews\r\nall over the world, is the quintessence of all Jewish prophecies,\r\nfrom _Moses_ to _Malachi_, of all Jewish teaching, from the men of\r\nthe _Great Synod_ to _Maimonides_ and to the present day.¹\r\n\r\n    ¹ See Appendix i: _The Hebrew Prophets and the Idea of\r\n      National Restoration_.\r\n\r\nThis idea of a national future for _Israel_ is the essence of all\r\nJewish prayers, from the time when the “Eighteen Benedictions” were\r\ncomposed to the last of the _Paitanim_. It is the keynote of all\r\n_Hebrew_ poetry, old and new, from the holy Psalms to the inspired\r\npoems of Jehudah Ha’levi, and from Jehudah Ha’levi to the living\r\n_Hebrew_ poets of our own day. This everlasting, all-absorbing and\r\nunconquerable idea of a national future is absolutely Jewish. It has\r\naccompanied the Jews from the cradle to the grave. It is the secret of\r\ntheir long existence, which has no parallel in history. It has nothing\r\nto do with nationalistic tendencies and currents among the Gentiles in\r\nmodern times. It existed as well in times of distress and misfortune\r\nas in times of prosperity. It was never the invention of individuals;\r\non the contrary, there can be found occasionally the expression of\r\nindividual views, in passages of little importance, which reveal\r\na somewhat different standpoint. But the Jewish people as a whole,\r\nincluding even the most extreme sects, such as the Karaites and the\r\nSamaritans, remained faithful to this idea.\r\n\r\nFrom an historical point of view, to speak of “Germans, Hungarians\r\nor Turks of the Jewish faith” in order to describe the Jews simply\r\nas persons of a certain religious faith similar to Protestants,\r\nCatholics or others, is nothing short of defying authentic history\r\nand hard facts. The Jews do not form a State within a State, as\r\nsome anti-Semites maintain; but they are undoubtedly an old historic\r\nnation within other nations, an old nation which has outlived Egyptian\r\nPharaohs, Assyrian Kings and Arabian Khalifs. That they at present\r\ndo not live in their own land, but are scattered everywhere, that\r\nthey have become acclimatized in different countries, and not only\r\nconform to their laws but belong to their most loyal citizens, that\r\nfact does not in the least alter the truth of our assertion. With\r\na few unimportant exceptions Jews marry among themselves, and as\r\nfar as the majority is concerned maintain their racial and historic\r\npeculiarities. Moreover, their entire religion abounds in historical\r\nideas and national reminiscences. They can by no means be compared\r\nwith Catholics or Protestants: there are French Catholics and German\r\nCatholics, English Protestants and German Protestants, but the Jewish\r\nreligion has been a religion of the Jewish nation alone for thousands\r\nof years.\r\n\r\nIt is only in quite modern times that a kind of opposition to this\r\nidea has begun to find expression in some Jewish quarters, influenced\r\nby the general tendencies of the end of the eighteenth century, and\r\nchiefly represented by the so-called Mendelssohnian school. This\r\nopposition has been intensified to a certain extent, since Modern\r\nZionism came into being with its clear programme and its up-to-date\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nThe principal points of this opposition to the Zionist cause are the\r\nfollowing:――\r\n\r\n  1. The Spiritual Character of Judaism.\r\n  2. The so-called Mission of the Jews.\r\n  3. The Progress of Modern Civilization.\r\n  4. The Duty of Patriotism, and\r\n  5. The Problem of Equality of Rights for the Jews.\r\n\r\nThe slightest examination of these objections shows that they are\r\npartly based on misunderstanding, and partly mere verbal criticism,\r\nwhich in no way affects the essence of Zionism.\r\n\r\n1. It would be absurd to suppose that Zionism denies the spiritual or\r\nuniversal character of Judaism. Zionism does not worship “tribalism.”\r\nFar from it. Jewish religious doctrines are of value to the whole\r\nworld, and their ethics undoubtedly tend to unite humanity. This is a\r\ntruth so evident as to need no confirmation. But Jews are not ghosts;\r\nthey are human beings, and they have to look upon Judaism in a human\r\nsense. And the human sense is that Jews, notwithstanding the spiritual\r\ncharacter of their teachings, are, like any other ethnic group, a\r\nspecies of the _genus homo_, a distinct people united by their origin\r\nand by their common history. “God,” said Mazzini, “has written one\r\nline of His thought upon each people, and consequently each is to\r\nbring its gifts into the market-place of the world’s good.” In this\r\nsense Zionists are Nationalists: they look forward to the gradual and\r\nultimate triumph of all national types, including their own. There is\r\nno reason for humanity to deny this natural right to the oldest nation\r\nof the world, and no justification for the Jews themselves to commit a\r\nsort of national hari-kari because of the spirituality of Judaism.\r\n\r\n2. The Zionist conception of a living nationality, with all universal\r\nqualities, yet living and distinctive, holds good also for the idea\r\nof the Mission of Judaism. Frankly, Zionists do not like this idea\r\nas a justification of the Jew’s “right to exist.” But what exactly\r\nis the meaning of a mission of a people? This uncertain phrase of a\r\nmission of a people, the mystic form in which the knowledge won by\r\na retrospective observation of history is expressed, the idea that\r\na given people in a given way has influenced the development of the\r\nhuman moral system. In fact, this mode of expression confuses cause\r\nand effect. It presupposes that definite tasks are assigned to a\r\nnation beforehand and that it exists and acts with regard to the\r\nsolution of these problems. The truth is, however, that every nation\r\ncreates definite phenomena in the history of civilization, whilst\r\nit lives and acts as it can and must owing to its natural conditions\r\nand the influence of its surroundings. A nation has no other mission\r\nbut to live and to develop fully all its latent capacities. Without\r\nintention and consciousness it then fulfils quite alone a rôle in\r\nhuman history. An oppressed, persecuted and despised Jewish people\r\nis worthless to humanity; a free, strong, happy Jewish people becomes\r\na useful partner in the task of the progress of the whole human race.\r\nThe co-operation in this task may be called a mission. In any case,\r\nthis mission will certainly not be fulfilled by a Jewish people\r\nharassed by persecution or absorbed by assimilation; but, on the\r\nother hand, it may be fulfilled by a national self-centred Jewish\r\npeople. Let us suppose that there are prospects of a “Jewish Mission”\r\nto spread far and wide the moralities that were revealed to the\r\nJewish nation at the foot of Mount _Sinai_, to influence humanity by\r\nteachings given them and by examples which they are called on to offer.\r\nSurely, though such a mission may perhaps be carried out to a certain\r\nextent in the Diaspora, if circumstances are favourable and if the\r\nJews themselves do not amalgamate and are not absorbed by others,\r\nit can be carried out best and most completely from a Jewish centre,\r\nfrom a Jewish Commonwealth living in that land from which the\r\nspirit of Judaism first passed into morality, into human society and\r\ninstitutions. There this mission will be on firm ground. Thence came\r\nthe Divine literature, which has affected all subsequent literature,\r\nall hearts, all minds, and all studies. From Palestine the light of\r\nthe Jewish genius will shine forth again with the light of a modern\r\ncivilization according to the ideas and teachings of the Prophets.\r\nThis will be the most efficient instrument of propaganda, because\r\nit will be the clearest manifestation of the real Jewish spirit and\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\n3. The progress of modern civilization has come to be regarded as a\r\nsort of modern _Messiah_ for the final solution of the Jewish problem.\r\nZionism considers this conception superficial and misleading. “Modern\r\nCivilization” is one of those vague, indefinite expressions which\r\nconvey to the mind ideas large enough, no doubt, but still very\r\nnebulous, very indistinct. But our age is a mystery-dispelling age.\r\nSomehow during the last generations mysteries have become fewer and\r\nfewer; the light of truth has become more penetrating. Men begin to\r\nknow what “modern civilization” is in its separate and distinctive\r\naspects. “Modern civilization” connotes advanced thought, domestic\r\ncomfort, railroads, telegraphs, telephones, airships, and many other\r\nthings of the kind. It connotes the development of those rich physical\r\nresources by which man is surrounded; it connotes also guns and\r\nsuper-dreadnoughts and submarines, diplomacy and power. Zionists\r\ndo not see how this “civilization” will become a _Messiah_ for the\r\nJews; they do not see how this “civilization” will solve any human\r\nor national problem. They see that in spite of all the admirable\r\nachievements of modern civilization something is wrong. Indeed, except\r\nfor technical improvements everything is still lacking. One must go\r\nback and seek again the proper fountain-head of that real civilization,\r\nof that culture of the heart, whose triumph will be the “new heavens\r\nand the new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness.” If any one idea\r\nrunning through all the teachings of the Jewish prophets, and embodied\r\nlikewise in the teachings of Christianity, is needed nowadays, it is\r\nthe doctrine of Love and Justice and Truth.\r\n\r\nWhere are these ideals? We have seen all the Demons of Earth, all the\r\nPowers of Darkness let loose. The signs on Belshazzar’s wall appear\r\nagain on the wall of modern civilization: _Mene, Tekel, Upharsin_.\r\nNever at any time has a crisis more momentous impended over humanity.\r\nNever at any time has a gloom more heavy darkened the world. Never\r\ndid humanity long more than nowadays for Truth, Justice and Liberty,\r\nfor the salvation of small, disinherited and oppressed nations. We\r\nall hope that good will come out of evil. But this good will not come\r\nautomatically out of “Modern Civilization.” It will come from that\r\nUniversal and National Justice to which Zionism appeals.\r\n\r\n4. Of greater apparent importance is the question of Patriotism. But\r\nin reality, so far as Zionism is concerned, this is no question at all.\r\nIt was an offensive and insulting question asked by anti-Semites: “Can\r\na Jew be a patriot?” It is equally insulting to ask: “Can a Zionist\r\nbe a patriot?” As a matter of fact there are no conflicting sentiments\r\nto be reconciled; there is only one sentiment: loyalty. A selfish\r\nmaterialist will never be attached to the old home of his fathers, nor\r\nto his present country. His maxim will be: _Ubi bene, ibi patria_. On\r\nthe other hand, a man of character will as easily combine two objects\r\nof loyalty as he easily and naturally combines the love of his country\r\nand of his family.\r\n\r\nThe heart of the Jew beats warmly for the country in which he lives,\r\nthe land in which is the home of his childhood, the school of his\r\nboyhood, the household of his mature life: the land in which he\r\nlabours in his busy years, and in which he expects to rest when his\r\nstruggles are over. No Englishman can love England better or labour\r\nfor it more zealously than does the English Jew. The child will never\r\nforget the fostering warmth of the breast on which it has rested in\r\nhappier days. This is natural. And Zionism has never interfered with\r\nthis feeling. Zionists are as faithful patriots as non-Zionists: they\r\nwork for their native lands, they sacrifice their fortunes and their\r\nlives. Even in countries where Jews have been deprived of the rights\r\nof citizenship they have been active as citizens, not only in war-time,\r\nbut also in peace-time. There is no body of individuals more loyal,\r\nmore charitable, more anxious at all times to do what they can for the\r\ncountry and to promote to their utmost its industry, arts and sciences.\r\nThere is not the slightest difference in this respect between Zionists\r\nand non-Zionists. Zionists do not know or care whether it will please\r\nanti-Semites to recognize Zionist patriotism or not. It is equally\r\nimpossible to know whether anti-Semites will recognize the patriotism\r\nof Jews who are not Zionists. Against sheer prejudice nothing can\r\nbe done. But among Jews themselves and broad-minded Gentiles this\r\nquestion of the incompatibility of Zionism and patriotism should be\r\neliminated at once on account of its manifest absurdity.\r\n\r\n5. The question of equality of rights is another problem out of which\r\nanti-Zionists have endeavoured to make controversial capital. The\r\nRussian Revolution, with its recognition not only of individual but\r\nalso of national equality of rights in the country where of all others\r\nthis problem was most acute for the Jews, has taken the ground from\r\nunder their feet; and we are no longer called on to treat seriously\r\nthe contention that there is any sort of incompatibility between the\r\nZionist claim for recognition of Jewish nationality and the claim of\r\nthe individual Jew, wherever he may be, to be allowed the privileges,\r\nas he is ready to fulfil the duties, of citizenship. There is, in fact,\r\nunconscious humour in the attempt to reduce the problem to a sort\r\nof alternative formula: “Either rights or Palestine,” and therefore\r\nchoose for yourself! “_Hic Rhodus, hic salta!_” This is surely the\r\nvery height of _naivete_. Such a dilemma is a senseless invention.\r\nEvery student of Jewish history knows that if there has been and if\r\nthere is persecution of the Jews or any limitation of their rights,\r\nthis has not been, and is not because the Jews were or are Zionists or\r\nnon-Zionists, Orthodox or Reformers, and so on. One might more easily\r\nfind some connection between anti-Semitism and the assimilation\r\nof those Jews who endeavoured to amalgamate too quickly. But even\r\nthis point is irrelevant. The Jews must not ignore themselves, and\r\nignoring themselves would not help them to get rights. The more\r\nthey respect themselves the more they will be respected. And what is\r\nthe self-respect of an ancient nation? Self-respect is faithfulness\r\nto one’s own history and traditions. There is no duality and\r\nno alternative. There is only one Jewish problem that requires\r\nsolution. There is only one Justice――to man and to nations. Justice\r\nwill consider Jewish needs; injustice will be deaf to any demand.\r\nWeak-minded and nervous people feared that Zionism which recognizes\r\nthe Jews as a nationality will allow the anti-Semites to reproach\r\nus triumphantly as having no native land. Weakness of mind and\r\nnervousness are bad counsellors. The anti-Semites did not wait for\r\nZionism in order to brand us as having no fatherland. The Christian\r\npeoples, however, amongst whom we may presuppose a sense of justice\r\nto exist, will believe us when we speak thus to them: “We Jews are\r\ntrue citizens of the States to which we belong. All interests of the\r\ncountry are also ours. We have no single interest which is opposed\r\nto any interest whatsoever of our country. We are strong and of deep\r\nfeeling, and are attached therefore with more than ordinary love\r\nto that spot where our cradle stood and where the remains of our\r\nancestors are buried.”\r\n\r\nThis self-reliance is of the essence of Zionism. Zionism is a Jewish\r\nprogramme. It is a Jewish programme because it requires of Jews\r\ncourage, initiative, resourcefulness, tenacity, will-power and\r\nsacrifice. For Jewish emancipation the most important condition is\r\nthat others should be humane. For Zionism the most important condition\r\nis that Jews should be Jews, adhering with tenacious consistency to\r\nthis truly national idea of their own. In the first case the real work\r\nhas to be done by others; Jews can do very little, their rôle being\r\nchiefly passive. They may be persecuted or not; they may get rights\r\nor not. Essentially it depends on many factors outside their influence\r\nand their control. But Zionism is essentially an active Jewish\r\nprogramme. Zionism is real Jewish self-help. Zionism tends to make\r\nthe Jews creators, not creatures of conditions and situations.\r\n\r\nZionists, like all Jews, are fundamentally optimists; but theirs is\r\nno mere “wait and see” optimism. Confidence in the Future has been\r\nthe curse of the Jew. Confidence in “Progress” as an idol has been\r\nblindness. Away with idols! Jews have to take their cause into their\r\nown hands, for God helps those who help themselves. First of all,\r\nthey have to look on the general situation of the world and on that\r\nof their own people as it is. They have also to read the signs of the\r\ntime. Time does not stand still. We are no longer at the end of the\r\neighteenth century. The fundamental character of the present age is\r\nclear. This is a Nationalist age.\r\n\r\nZionism looks at the 2000 years of the Jewish tragedy in the\r\nperspective of national justice. The Jewish problem is essentially\r\n(and independently of the necessity of human rights for the Jews\r\neverywhere) a question of national homelessness.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe world has been passing through a period which sometimes seems like\r\na nightmare of blood and ruin, and sometimes like one of the greatest\r\neras in which man can be called upon to live. All over Europe, almost\r\nall over the world, the storm of the greatest and most terrible war\r\nin history has burst with the fury of a thousand volcanic eruptions\r\nand a thousand hells. Flourishing countries have been reduced to heaps\r\nof smoking ruins. Vast fields have been saturated with the blood of\r\nmillions of men. Large masses of population, almost whole peoples,\r\nhave been ruined or driven out of their countries.\r\n\r\nBut, after all, peace will return to the troubled world, that peace\r\nwhich will be peace indeed――the peace of security, of justice for\r\ngreat and small nations everywhere. The present _Armageddon_ is\r\nsucceeded by new problems and their solutions. We are facing political,\r\neconomic, and, above all, national problems. It is plain common sense,\r\nand needs no argument, that all present developments tend inevitably\r\nto accentuate afresh and emphatically historic traditions, claims\r\nand distinctions. There will be difficulties in settling all these\r\nquestions, but all such difficulties will be overcome by determination\r\nand necessity. Plenty of work will have to be done, for it may be\r\nlong before the set-back which the war has given to the progress\r\nof the world is made good and the effects of this cruel destruction\r\nare obliterated. But this work will be achieved sooner or later. The\r\nwhole energy of Governments and nations will have to be devoted to\r\nreconstruction. At last the ploughman will return from the battlefield\r\nto the cornfield, the tradesman from the camp to the market, and\r\neverybody to his old home and business. Every nation which possesses\r\na country of its own will be restored. They will make a slow or rapid\r\nrecovery from the ills and losses of the war. Finally, the shattered\r\nagricultural, domestic, industrial and spiritual lives of the people\r\nwill be re-established.\r\n\r\nNow, among all the battlefields and graveyards of the war, there is\r\nnot one to be compared with the battlefield of the Jewish _Ghetto_ in\r\nEastern Europe. Millions of Jews have waded through seas of blood and\r\ntears. Towns and villages have been dyed with their blood. The Jews\r\nhave sacrificed their trade, their fortunes and themselves. The flower\r\nof their manhood has been lost or mutilated. The sources of life have\r\nbeen cut off, every link of the chain of existence has been broken.\r\nTheir schools and spiritual centres are no more. The sword of Damocles\r\nis suspended over the heads of the survivors. Starving and ruined\r\ncommunities are trembling on the edge of the precipice.\r\n\r\nAnd what has the future in store for these millions? What will be\r\nthe outcome of this terrible crisis for the disinherited and homeless\r\nmasses? Where are the fields to be cultivated by them again? Where\r\nwill they be able to convert spears into pruning-hooks? They are in\r\nthe air. Have all their sufferings been for naught? Will the Jewish\r\nmasses have to migrate again to England and to America and elsewhere,\r\nto face the world again as mendicants and “undesirable aliens”? Much\r\nJewish benevolence is uselessly diffused, losing itself in the sands\r\nof vain or ill-directed effort, and most runs to absolute waste. With\r\nall these diverse floods of unutilized kindness and brotherly love\r\nthat yearns to help but lacks the means and knows not how to put an\r\nend to the suffering, the situation remains unchanged.\r\n\r\n  There is a solution for this\r\nproblem. This solution is Zionism. Give to the Jews a footing on their\r\nown soil, house and home of their own! Palestine (and gradually the\r\nthinly populated neighbouring districts) can become a great outlet\r\nfor Jewish population: Palestine can again be made to “blossom like\r\na rose,” and be capable of supporting a great population as in the\r\nglorious days of _David_ and _Solomon_. Vast tracts of the so-called\r\nSyrian Desert are only regions deforested, and wherever the hum of men\r\ncomes peacefully, the arid soil bursts into life. The plains of the\r\n_Hauran_, the villages of the _Jordan_, and the land of _Gilead_ would\r\nform one of the richest and largest food-producing areas in the world.\r\n\r\nPalestine can again become a centre. Napoleon I. and Alexander the\r\nGreat, in their days, recognized this country as the key to the\r\ngate between West and East. The latter won it and penetrated to the\r\nPunjab; the former failed and had to go home again. But whatever\r\nvalue Palestine possessed in those days is immensely enhanced now by\r\nthe vast extension of European civilization and industry over Africa,\r\nAustralia, India and all the East, and by steam power, railways, the\r\ntelegraph and the Suez Canal, which have shortened distances, and made\r\nthe world so very small in comparison with what it was before; so that\r\nPalestine is now ten times more valuable and is suited by her position\r\nto become a blessed and happy country.\r\n\r\nNow the present situation is full of possibilities and significance.\r\nGreat developments have taken place in connection with the old home of\r\nthe Jewish nation. This is the hour of the Zionist. The time has come\r\nto act. History will condemn the Zionists if they do not use their\r\npresent opportunity. But what can their activity be? The reply has\r\nbeen given by the Programme of Zionism, the Basle Programme, adopted\r\nat the First Congress, in 1897:――\r\n\r\n  “_The object of Zionism is to establish for the Jewish people a\r\n  home in Palestine secured by public law._\r\n\r\n  “_The Congress contemplates the following means to the\r\n  attainment of this end:――_\r\n\r\n  “1. _The promotion, on suitable lines, of the colonization of\r\n  Palestine by Jewish agricultural and industrial workers._\r\n\r\n  “2. _The organization and binding together of the whole of\r\n  Jewry by means of appropriate institutions, local and\r\n  international, in accordance with the laws of each country._\r\n\r\n  “3. _The strengthening and fostering of Jewish national\r\n  sentiment and consciousness._\r\n\r\n  “4. _Preparatory steps towards obtaining government consent,\r\n  where necessary, to the attainment of the aim of Zionism._”\r\n\r\nIn constituting the organization for the purpose of carrying out\r\nthis work Zionists are animated by one desire, namely, to establish a\r\ncentre in the home of their fathers, where Jews shall earn their bread,\r\nand where the soul of the nation can be active in its own way. They\r\nwish to combine a judicious use of Jewish energies with the forces of\r\nJewish capital and Jewish emigration. By means of these efforts they\r\nwill lift some of the masses out of the Jewish homelessness of the\r\nDiaspora to a new level of material contentment and moral dignity in\r\nPalestine.\r\n\r\nZionists have started this work, and it has proved to be good work.\r\nThe _Chovevé Zion_ and Zionists have created the new colonization\r\nof Palestine. They are engaged in selecting suitable elements, in\r\nconveying them, in helping them to establish themselves, in supplying\r\nthem with all kinds of information and encouragement. It has been said,\r\nand is still being obstinately repeated by anti-Zionists again and\r\nagain, that Zionism aims at the creation of an independent “Jewish\r\nState.” But this is wholly fallacious. The “Jewish State” was never\r\na part of the Zionist programme. The “Jewish State” was the title of\r\nHerzl’s first pamphlet, which had the supreme merit of forcing people\r\nto think. This pamphlet was followed by the first Zionist Congress,\r\nwhich accepted the Basle Programme――the only programme in existence.\r\n\r\nThe opposition, driven from one point of vantage to another, has\r\nmade a certain confusion of ideas, arising from the term “political\r\nZionism,” a pretext for decrying Zionism as a “political” movement.\r\nZionism, it is true, is a political as well as a practical and a\r\ncultural movement. But wherein lies the political character of the\r\nmovement? The term “political” covers two different conceptions. One\r\nis connected with the idea of adventure, intrigue, rivalry, antagonism\r\nor revolt; the other is that of a system which takes into account\r\npolitical conditions. A political movement in the first sense aims at\r\ncarrying out its undertaking on the lines of political speculation;\r\nbut a political movement in the second sense, like Zionism, aims at\r\ncarrying on its work under all circumstances, and at the same time at\r\nconvincing those in power of the utility of the work, in order to get\r\nthe best possible conditions. The Basle Programme and the whole of\r\nZionist activity bear witness to the fact that Zionism has nothing in\r\ncommon with political adventure. Zionists have never been influenced\r\nby any political aggressive spirit, nor have they in any way proposed\r\nto place themselves in antagonism to any Government or any other\r\nnation. Zionists have always desired to be supported (§ 4 of the Basle\r\nProgramme) by all Governments on the merits of their object, and by\r\nall nations who know that Zionist work can only advance the interests\r\nof Justice and Freedom.\r\n\r\nZionism has the following objects in view:――\r\n\r\n  A home for Jews who are materially or morally suffering.\r\n\r\n  A home for Jewish education, learning and literature.\r\n\r\n  A source of idealism for Jews all over the world.\r\n\r\n  A place in which Jews can live a healthy Jewish life.\r\n\r\n  A revival of the language of the Bible.\r\n\r\n  The resurrection by civilization and industry of the old home\r\n    of our fathers, long neglected and ruined.\r\n\r\n  The creation of a sound, strong Jewish agricultural class.\r\n\r\nIn this way Zionism will establish a Jewish society, bound together\r\nby similarity of feeling and unity of common ideas, working out\r\nits destiny in its own way. Zionists want a commonwealth of Jewish\r\ncolonization and labour, a settlement of Jewish pioneers and workers\r\nwho will be able to create and to develop a civilization of their own,\r\nundisturbed by any restrictions. This is possible only in Palestine,\r\nand is the paramount necessity of the whole Jewish people all over the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThe creation of a settlement of this kind will help the Jews\r\neconomically, but how much and how quickly it will help depends on the\r\nintensity of the work. It may be slow work, but it will be fundamental\r\nwork. It is the foundation-stone for a great structure. Palestine may\r\neven become the home of considerable masses of Jews. But in any case\r\nthe creation of a national home for the Jews will raise their prestige\r\namong the nations. It will never be an obstacle in the way of rights;\r\non the contrary, it will help in this direction also.\r\n\r\nOn the spiritual and intellectual side this work will undoubtedly\r\nbring about a great revival of Judaism. Judaism will be no mere\r\nabstraction, but something real and living. “Jewish science” or\r\n_Hebrew_ studies will not be merely a careful _post-mortem_ analysis,\r\nto be undertaken exclusively by scholars and specialists. These\r\nstudies will appear as the unbroken chain of the common cultural\r\nheritage of a living nation.\r\n\r\nZionists are under no misapprehension as to the gravity of the\r\ndifficulties which may confront them. But they will meet these\r\ndifficulties as serious men inspired by a great ideal and with a just\r\ncause. With a clear and distinct purpose in view, Zionists desire\r\nto work in full harmony with all the friends of Justice and Liberty\r\nand Truth, and while striving for the rescue of their own people\r\nthey would not only not interfere with any just principle or cause\r\ninjury to any patriotic aspiration of any other nation; they would\r\naccommodate and co-ordinate their cause with others. It is in this\r\nsense that we speak of “political Zionism.”\r\n\r\nHistory shows that the Zionist idea and the continual renewal of\r\nefforts in this direction have been a tradition with the English\r\npeople for centuries. English Christians taught the undying principles\r\nof Jewish nationality. Zionism was thus permanently connected with\r\nEngland. The Jewish national idea has always particularly appealed\r\nto English feeling, has touched the heart of the English nation. The\r\nfacts and records disprove the absurd yet deeply rooted idea that\r\nZionism is only a vision of sectarians or a hallucination of dreamers.\r\nThe documents cited in this volume give ample and convincing proof\r\nof the high moral dignity and political value of the Zionist cause\r\nas championed by prominent English thinkers, men of letters and poets\r\nthroughout many generations. For nearly three centuries Zionism was a\r\nreligious as well as a political idea which great Christians and Jews,\r\nchiefly in England but to some extent also in France, handed down\r\nto posterity. And moreover, all the available evidence points to the\r\nfact that whenever the attention of the world has been invited to the\r\nquestion of Palestine and to measures for improving the development\r\nof the Near East, English opinion has given the most careful and\r\nsympathetic consideration to the Zionist idea. Thus the present\r\nZionist movement is essentially a logical conclusion of all the\r\npremises which have been accepted from different points of view,\r\nnot only by a considerable number of Jewish authorities, but also\r\nby public opinion in great civilized countries of Western Europe.\r\nZionists, therefore, hope that English Christians will be worthy heirs\r\nand successors to the Earl of Shaftesbury, George Eliot, and many\r\nothers; English Jews to Sir Moses Montefiore, French Christians to\r\nHenri Dunant, and French Jews to Joseph Salvador, Bernard Lazare,\r\nand others. One may also hope that as Zionism is not a source of\r\nconflicting element but a source of peace and unity, all the nations\r\nof the world will be open to conviction and will give strong support\r\nto its aims.\r\n\r\nZionism has started its work in Palestine, and will pursue it.\r\nRecognising the aspirations of the Jewish people with regard to\r\nPalestine and their historic rights, the British Government on November\r\n2nd, 1917, made the well-known Declaration. This Declaration had been\r\nanticipated by the letter from the French Government of 4th June, 1917,\r\nand was fully endorsed in the letter from _M._ Stephen Pichon, Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs, to myself, dated 14th February, 1918, and the\r\nletter to me communicating the concurrence of the Italian Government\r\nwith these declarations, dated 9th May, 1918. (See Volume II., pp.\r\n1 ff.) It will be the task of Zionism to accumulate by every effort the\r\nresources, material and moral, required for this purpose. Those Jews\r\nwho are not yet in the movement will be brought into it by time and\r\nexperience, because there is indeed no argument against this peaceful\r\nidea of national justice, except pure and unscrupulous prejudice, which\r\nmust disappear. But Zionism is anxious to have also the moral support\r\nof the nations, and particularly in this country it is impossible\r\nfor any Jew with a historic consciousness to forget the noble Zionist\r\ntradition of England during many centuries. Some of the most glorious\r\npages in British history have been those in which she took a part, and\r\nan honourable and leading part, in the revival of ancient nations. The\r\nfriends of Greece, of Italy, cannot forget this record.\r\n\r\nZionists can define only what they need. They need not only to\r\ncontinue their work, but to develop it on the largest possible\r\nscale. They want to do the peaceful work of agriculturists, craftsmen\r\nand intellectuals. They are ready to invest capital, energy and\r\nintelligence in order to establish a home for the Jews. Palestine is\r\nto be re-made. To this end national autonomy safeguarding the welfare\r\nof a Jewish Palestine is needed.\r\n\r\nLet humanity do for Palestine only a small part of what has been\r\ndone so liberally for the most exotic colony――nay, less than that,\r\nbecause Zionists ask for no material support, and for no embarrassing\r\nresponsibility. They ask only for sympathetic consideration and\r\nhelp, for recognition and protection. And let humanity be sure of\r\nthe loyalty of a people which, although sorely tried, has never grown\r\ncold in its affections, a people which by its resurrection will become\r\nagain what it was in very ancient times, not a military power but\r\na spiritual and peaceful power. Then the time will come when this\r\npeople’s gratitude will recognize its indebtedness to the world for\r\nthe co-operation which will assist its great and just cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n                 BY THE RT. HON. A. J. BALFOUR, M.P.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHETHER it be helpful for one who is not a Jew, either by race or\r\nreligion, to say even the briefest word by way of introduction to\r\na book on Zionism is, in my own opinion, doubtful. But my friend,\r\nM. Nahum Sokolow, tells me that I long ago gave him reason to expect\r\nthat, when the time came, I would render him this small measure of\r\nassistance; and if he attaches value to it, I cannot allow my personal\r\ndoubts as to its value to stand in his way.\r\n\r\nThe only qualification I possess is that I have always been greatly\r\ninterested in the Jewish question, and that in the early years of this\r\ncentury, when anti-Semitism in Eastern Europe was in an acute stage,\r\nI did my best to support a scheme devised by Mr. Chamberlain, then\r\nColonial Secretary, for creating a Jewish settlement in East Africa,\r\nunder the British flag. There it was hoped that Jews flying from\r\npersecution might found a community where, in harmony with their\r\nown religion, development on traditional lines might (we thought)\r\npeacefully proceed without external interruption, and free from any\r\nfears of violence.\r\n\r\nThe scheme was certainly well-intentioned, and had, I think, many\r\nmerits. But it had one serious defect. It was not Zionism. It\r\nattempted to find a home for men of Jewish religion and Jewish race in\r\na region far removed from the country where that race was nurtured and\r\nthat religion came into being. Conversations I held with Dr. Weizmann\r\nin January, 1906, convinced me that history could not thus be ignored,\r\nand that if a home was to be found for the Jewish people, homeless now\r\nfor nearly nineteen hundred years, it was vain to seek it anywhere but\r\nin Palestine.\r\n\r\nBut why, it may be asked, is local sentiment to be more considered\r\nin the case of the Jew than (say) in that of the Christian or the\r\nBuddhist? All historic religions rouse feelings which cluster round\r\nthe places made memorable by the words and deeds, the lives and deaths,\r\nof those who brought them into being.\r\n\r\nDoubtless these feelings should always be treated with respect; but\r\nno one suggests that the regions where these venerable sites are to\r\nbe found should, of set purpose and with much anxious contrivance, be\r\ncolonized by the spiritual descendants of those who originally made\r\nthem famous. If the centuries have brought no change of ownership\r\nor occupancy we are well content. But if it be otherwise, we make\r\nno effort to reverse the course of history. None suggest that we\r\nshould plant Buddhist colonies in India, the ancient home of Buddhism,\r\nor renew in favour of Christendom the crusading adventures of our\r\nmediæval ancestors. Yet, if this be wisdom when we are dealing with\r\nBuddhism and Christianity, why, it may be asked, is it not also wisdom\r\nwhen we are dealing with Judaism and the Jews?\r\n\r\nThe answer is, that the cases are not parallel. The position of the\r\nJews is unique. For them race, religion and country are inter-related,\r\nas they are inter-related in the case of no other race, no other\r\nreligion, and no other country on earth. In no other case are the\r\nbelievers in one of the greatest religions of the world to be found\r\n(speaking broadly) only among the members of a single small people;\r\nin the case of no other religion is its past development so intimately\r\nbound up with the long political history of a petty territory wedged\r\nin between States more powerful far than it could ever be; in the\r\ncase of no other religion are its aspirations and hopes expressed in\r\nlanguage and imagery so utterly dependent for their meaning on the\r\nconviction that only from this one land, only through this one history,\r\nonly by this one people, is full religious knowledge to spread through\r\nall the world. By a strange and most unhappy fate it is this people of\r\nall others which, retaining to the full its racial self-consciousness,\r\nhas been severed from its home, has wandered into all lands, and\r\nhas nowhere been able to create for itself an organized social\r\ncommonwealth. Only Zionism――so at least Zionists believe――can provide\r\nsome mitigation of this great tragedy.\r\n\r\nDoubtless there are difficulties, doubtless there are objections\r\n――great difficulties, very real objections. And it is, I suspect,\r\namong the Jews themselves that these are most acutely felt. Yet no one\r\ncan reasonably doubt that if, as I believe, Zionism can be developed\r\ninto a working scheme, the benefit it would bring to the Jewish people,\r\nespecially perhaps to that section of it which most deserves our pity,\r\nwould be great and lasting. It is not merely that large numbers of\r\nthem would thus find a refuge from religious and social persecution;\r\nbut that they would bear corporate responsibilities and enjoy\r\ncorporate opportunities of a kind which, from the nature of the case,\r\nthey can never possess as citizens of any non-Jewish State. It is\r\ncharged against them by their critics that they now employ their great\r\ngifts to exploit for personal ends a civilization which they have not\r\ncreated, in communities they do little to maintain. The accusation\r\nthus formulated is manifestly false. But it is no doubt true that in\r\nlarge parts of Europe their loyalty to the State in which they dwell\r\nis (to put it mildly) feeble compared with their loyalty to their\r\nreligion and their race. How indeed could it be otherwise? In none\r\nof the regions of which I speak have they been given the advantage\r\nof equal citizenship, in some they have been given no right of\r\ncitizenship at all. Great suffering is the inevitable result; but\r\nnot suffering alone. Other evils follow which aggravate the original\r\nmischief. Constant oppression, with occasional outbursts of violent\r\npersecution, are apt either to crush their victims, or to develop\r\nin them self-protecting qualities which do not always assume an\r\nattractive shape. The Jews have never been crushed. Neither cruelty\r\nnor contempt, neither unequal laws nor illegal oppression, have ever\r\nbroken their spirit, or shattered their unconquerable hopes. But it\r\nmay well be true that, where they have been compelled to live among\r\ntheir neighbours as if these were their enemies, they have often\r\nobtained, and sometimes deserved, the reputation of being undesirable\r\ncitizens. Nor is this surprising. If you oblige many men to be\r\nmoney-lenders, some will assuredly be usurers. If you treat an\r\nimportant section of the community as outcasts, they will hardly\r\nshine as patriots. Thus does intolerance blindly labour to create the\r\njustification for its own excesses.\r\n\r\nIt seems evident that, for these and other reasons, Zionism will\r\nmitigate the lot and elevate the status of no negligible fraction of\r\nthe Jewish race. Those who go to Palestine will not be like those who\r\nnow migrate to London or New York. They will not be animated merely\r\nby the desire to lead in happier surroundings the kind of life they\r\nformerly led in Eastern Europe. They will go in order to join a\r\ncivil community which completely harmonizes with their historical\r\nand religious sentiments: a community bound to the land it inhabits\r\nby something deeper even than custom: a community whose members will\r\nsuffer from no divided loyalty, nor any temptation to hate the laws\r\nunder which they are forced to live. To them the material gain should\r\nbe great; but surely the spiritual gain will be greater still.\r\n\r\nBut these, it will be said, are not the only Jews whose welfare we\r\nhave to consider. Granting, if only for argument’s sake, that Zionism\r\nwill on them confer a benefit, will it not inflict an injury upon\r\nothers who, though Jews by descent, and often by religion, desire\r\nwholly to identify themselves with the life of the country wherein\r\nthey have made their home. Among these are to be found some of the\r\nmost gifted members of a gifted race. Their ranks contain (at least,\r\nso I think) more than their proportionate share of the world’s supply\r\nof men distinguished in science and philosophy, literature and art,\r\nmedicine, politics and law. (Of finance and business I need say\r\nnothing.)\r\n\r\nNow there is no doubt that many of this class look with a certain\r\nmeasure of suspicion and even dislike upon the Zionist movement. They\r\nfear that it will adversely affect their position in the country of\r\ntheir adoption. The great majority of them have no desire to settle\r\nin Palestine. Even supposing a Zionist community were established,\r\nthey would not join it. But they seem to think (if I understand them\r\nrightly) that so soon as such a community came into being men of\r\nJewish blood, still more men of Jewish religion, would be regarded by\r\nunkindly critics as out of place elsewhere. Their ancient home having\r\nbeen restored to them, they would be expected to reside there.\r\n\r\nI cannot share these fears. I do not deny that, in some countries\r\nwhere legal equality is firmly established, Jews may still be regarded\r\nwith a certain measure of prejudice. But this prejudice, where it\r\nexists, is not due to Zionism, nor will Zionism embitter it. The\r\ntendency should surely be the other way. Everything which assimilates\r\nthe national and international status of the Jews to that of other\r\nraces ought to mitigate what remains of ancient antipathies: and\r\nevidently this assimilation would be promoted by giving them that\r\nwhich all other nations possess: a local habitation and a national\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nOn this aspect of the subject I need perhaps say no more. The future\r\nof Zionism depends on deeper causes than these. That it will settle\r\nthe “Jewish question” I dare not hope. But that it will tend to\r\npromote that mutual sympathy and comprehension which is the only sure\r\nbasis of toleration I firmly believe. Few, I think, of M. Sokolow’s\r\nreaders, be they Jew or be they Christian, will rise from the\r\nperusal of the impressive story which he has told so fully and so\r\nwell, without feeling that Zionism differs in kind from ordinary\r\nphilanthropic efforts and that it appeals to different motives. If it\r\nsucceeds, it will do a great spiritual and material work for the Jews,\r\nbut not for them alone. For as I read its meaning it is, among other\r\nthings, a serious endeavour to mitigate the age-long miseries created\r\nfor Western civilization by the presence in its midst of a Body which\r\nit too long regarded as alien and even hostile, but which it was\r\nequally unable to expel or to absorb. Surely, for this if for no other\r\nreason, it should receive our support.\r\n\r\n                                                          A. J.

Viscount Bryce._\r\n\r\n                                              3, BUCKINGHAM GATE,\r\n                                              S.W. 1,\r\n                                              _January 30th, 1918_.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nIn response to your request for some observations by me on the value\r\nwhich your treatise may have for students of history, I send you these\r\nfew lines. The pressure of heavy and urgent work forbids me to deal in\r\nany but the briefest way with the subject of your book, great as its\r\ninterest is.\r\n\r\nThe history of Israel presents some of the most striking phenomena\r\nin world history. No other nation (with the exception of the two very\r\nancient nations of the Far East) has annals so long as are those of\r\nthe descendants of Abraham. Those annals go back, dim as are their\r\nearlier outlines, to a time long anterior to the earliest records of\r\nthe Hellenic and Italic peoples. The records of the old civilization\r\nof Assyria and Egypt are, no doubt, even more remote in time, but\r\nthe nations that created those civilizations have been so changed\r\nby conquest and the admixture of new elements that we can no longer\r\nrecognise them as the same. But Israel has preserved its identity\r\nthrough all vicissitudes. It was carried into captivity in a far land,\r\nand returned thence after seventy years. It was, after the destruction\r\nof Jerusalem by the Emperor Hadrian, scattered over the face of the\r\nearth, and now counts its children everywhere, from Singapore to\r\nSan Francisco. Its numbers have grown to be fifteen or twenty times\r\ngreater than they were before the Great Dispersion. It has been kept\r\nin existence as a nation through many centuries of oppression and\r\nsuffering by its Faith and its Literature, a faith embodied in a law\r\nwhich included both a moral and a ceremonial code, a Literature small\r\nin bulk but splendid in content, which has formed the mind of the\r\npeople, sharpening their intelligence and intensifying their national\r\nself-consciousness. It is one of those three great literatures of the\r\nancient world which still rule the thought and still help to form the\r\ncharacter of mankind. This is a unique phenomenon, and perhaps the\r\nmost striking testimony that history can show to the vivifying power\r\nof ideas.\r\n\r\nThis consciousness of an enduring national life has been constantly\r\nassociated in the thoughts of Israel with the ancient home in\r\nPalestine, a little country, no bigger than Wales in Britain or\r\nConnecticut in North America. To its rocky hills and green valleys,\r\nits cities and its battlefields, its heroes and its prophets, the\r\nhearts of the people have turned in days of sorrow. The memories of\r\nthese things have maintained the sense of national life. The flame has\r\noften burnt low, but it has never been extinguished. Quite recently\r\nit has leapt up with a brilliant glow. The idea that a part of the\r\ndispersed people should be gathered from the regions where their lot\r\nwas worst and be re-settled in their ancient home, long desolated\r\nby the tyranny of the cruel and rapacious Turk, has gained strength,\r\nand the capture of Jerusalem by the British arms has now made it seem\r\nattainable. The sympathy of many thoughtful and sympathetic Christians\r\nhas been gained, and the British Government has given clear expression\r\nto that sympathy. It is to the history of this idea of re-settlement,\r\nto which the name of Zionism is now given, that your book is devoted.\r\nThere are, I am aware, some differences of opinion among Jews\r\nthemselves as to the form in which this idea might be practically\r\nrealized, and as to the way in which that form might affect the\r\nposition of Jews in the countries where they now dwell and of which\r\nthey wish to remain citizens, though I gather that these differences\r\ndo not touch the question of the desirability of a large Jewish\r\nimmigration into Palestine. Upon these differences of opinion I must\r\nnot pronounce any judgment, though personally inclined to believe\r\nthat the existence of a national home at the eastern end of the\r\nMediterranean will not affect the loyalty to the other countries where\r\nthey dwell of the Jews settled in those countries, nor expose them\r\nto any suspicion of disloyalty. It is as a student of history, and in\r\nthat capacity only, that on this particular occasion I desire to speak,\r\nexpressing my sense of the high interest of the subject of your book,\r\nand feeling that the rapid growth of the Zionist movement, the forces\r\nthat have produced it, and the enthusiasm it has excited, well deserve\r\nto be fully, accurately, and impartially described.\r\n\r\n                                          I am,\r\n                                              Faithfully yours,\r\n                                                            BRYCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. N. SOKOLOW.\r\n\r\n                 _From Colonel Sir Mark Sykes, M.P._\r\n\r\n                                              9, BUCKINGHAM GATE,\r\n                                              S.W. 1,\r\n                                              _May 27th, 1918_.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MR. SOKOLOW,\r\n\r\nAfter many days’ delay, I write to you my message of goodwill and good\r\nhope for the success of this your great work on the cause which you\r\nhave at heart and for which you have laboured so long.\r\n\r\nIt is an odd thought which crosses my mind at this moment――if it\r\nbe egotistical I cannot help it――nevertheless I will set it down.\r\nI foresee myself handed down to posterity as one of those enduring\r\nobscurities, who did nothing in any way remarkable, yet whose names\r\nlast for all time, because they scratched their fleeting impressions\r\non the Memnon at Luxor.\r\n\r\nIn languages yet unknown, and in States unborn, this your work will be\r\nread by people who will know perhaps as little of the details of life\r\nin these days as we do of those of the times of the first dispersion\r\nof the Jews.\r\n\r\nYour cause has about it an enduring quality which mocks at time; if\r\na generation is but a breath in the life of a nation, an epoch is but\r\nthe space ’twixt a dawn and a sunrise in the history of Zionism.\r\n\r\nWhen all the temporal things this world now holds are as dead and\r\nforgotten as the curled and scented Kings of Babylon who dragged your\r\nforefathers into captivity, there will still be Jews, and so long as\r\nthere are Jews there must be Zionism.\r\n\r\nWe live in an age when mankind is reaping the whirlwind of its\r\nwickedness and folly. Wherein the past men have sown those dragons’\r\nteeth of intolerance, tyranny, injustice, and race hatred, legions of\r\narmed men now spring up to destroy and shatter the husbanded resources\r\nof progress.\r\n\r\nThe War of to-day is the logical result of the “peace” of yesterday.\r\nThe grand problem which we have to consider is whether or no the\r\npeace of to-morrow is to be the precursor of a future war which will\r\noverwhelm civilization for ever. Unless forces different to those\r\nwhich have counted in the direction of the affairs of men hitherto\r\nare in the ascendant, I feel no doubt that what is called Civilization\r\nis predestined to suicide, and that in the real meaning of the words\r\n“_felo de se_.” The blind genius which people call “science” wrests\r\nmechanical discoveries and chemical formulæ from the accumulated\r\nexperience of the past and gives men hygiene, transit, and commerce\r\nwith one hand, and explosives and military organization with the other.\r\nYou, my dear Mr. Sokolow, represent a people who have watched this\r\nprocess of constructive destruction in the course of evolution, and\r\nhave seen the higher men climb in pride and vanity the more deplorable\r\nis their fall.\r\n\r\nIf the peace which is to follow the War is to be a real peace, and not\r\na pause in war, then you and your people must be watchers no longer.\r\nIn Zionism lies your people’s opportunity. In alliance with those\r\nother forces of regeneration and illumination which are centred on\r\nJerusalem and which radiate through the world, it may be that you and\r\nyour successors will play a part in establishing a moral order which\r\nwill enable mankind to combine universal material progress with mutual\r\nsubjection and charity.\r\n\r\n                                        Yours very sincerely,\r\n                                                      MARK SYKES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THE ILLUSTRATOR TO THE READER\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE privilege afforded me by my friend the Author of participating in\r\nthe production of a work on so epoch-marking a question as Zionism,\r\nhas more than compensated me for any time and trouble I have expended\r\non the particular section allotted to me. There are eighty-nine\r\nillustrations in the book, to which I have fortunately been able to\r\ncontribute thirty, dealing mainly with the earlier period. For the\r\nportraits, _etc._, of many of our contemporaries, I must accord my\r\nsincere thanks to those whose courtesy and kindness have enabled me\r\nto carry out my purpose.\r\n\r\nI am indebted for the lithograph of Elim H. _d’_Avigdor¹ to his\r\nrecently deceased widow. Mr. Semi Tolkowsky obtained for me an\r\nunpublished photograph of Colonel C. R. Conder from his daughter,\r\nMrs. Julian G. Lousada. That venerable lady, Mrs. Finn, lent me a\r\nphotograph of her late husband, “The British Consul of Jerusalem and\r\nPalestine.” Mr. Joseph Cohen Lask granted me the loan of the Hebrew\r\nperiodical, _Keneseth Israel_, containing a woodcut of David Gordon,\r\nthe editor. The celebrated artist, Leopold Pilichowski, entrusted me\r\nwith the negative of his famous painting of Theodor Herzl, known as\r\nthe “Congress” portrait. It was done from sketches taken from life\r\nduring the Uganda Congress, and finished in 1906 to the order of\r\nthe late President, David Wolffsohn, for the Actions Committee,\r\nto be exhibited at Zionist congresses. The illustration of _Grand\r\nRabbin_ Zadok Kahn is taken from a pastel by the Jewish artist,\r\nJ. F. Aktuaryus, in the collection of Mr. Elkan N. Adler. Dr. Hartwig\r\nHirschfeld lent me a lithograph of his father-in-law, Dr. Louis\r\nLoewe; and Professor Dr. Arnold Netter sent from Paris a lithograph\r\nof his uncle, Charles Netter. The portrait of Laurence Oliphant was\r\nreproduced from an unpublished photograph in the possession of his\r\nrelative, Mr. Lancelot Oliphant. To procure a likeness of Dr. M. J.\r\nRaphall I had some difficulty. The Birmingham congregation to whom\r\nhe ministered from 1841‒1849 knew nothing of any portrait. From an\r\nadvertisement in the _Jewish Chronicle_, 27 July, 1849, it appears\r\nthat the learned _Rabbi_ possessed a painting done of him by W. H.\r\nVernon, from which Mosely Levi of Birmingham produced a lithograph,\r\nbut I failed to discover the whereabouts of either. Knowing that on\r\nleaving this country he settled in the United States, I communicated\r\nwith Mr. Albert M. Friedenberg, the corresponding secretary of\r\nthe American Jewish Historical Society, to whom my particular\r\nacknowledgments are due for discovering a small oil painting of the\r\nDoctor, copied from a photograph taken in his later years, in the\r\npossession of the _B’nai Jeshurun_ congregation of New York, whose\r\n_Rabbi_ he was from his arrival in America until 1866, two years\r\nbefore his demise. With the consent of the Trustees, and by the\r\ncourtesy of Mr. Herman Levy, the President, an excellent reproduction\r\nwas placed at my disposal.\r\n\r\n    ¹ From a pencil drawing by his second daughter, Estelle,\r\n      Mrs. George E. Nathan.\r\n\r\nThe frontispiece to the second volume, “Edmond _de_ Rothschild,” is a\r\nfacsimile of a photograph¹ from the painting by _M._ Aimé Morot. From\r\n_M._ A. Salvador, Mdme. L. J. Raynall and _M._ André Spire of Paris\r\nwere instrumental in procuring a photograph of his uncle _M._ Joseph\r\nSalvador, whose portrait has hitherto never been published.\r\n\r\n    ¹ Autograph presentation copy from the Baron to the Author.\r\n\r\nMiss Marian O. Wilson came to my assistance in permitting me to take\r\na copy of a photograph of her father, Sir Charles W. Wilson, and Mr.\r\nJoseph Cowen lent J. H.

Paul Knell, Matthew\r\n    Arnold, Sir H. Havelock, Gordon, Livingstone, Ruskin, Carlyle,\r\n    Taine, Sir L. T. Dibdin, Huxley, and J. R. Green――The Puritans\r\n    ――The Pilgrim Fathers――James I.――Cromwell.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO great idea, once proclaimed, has ever yet perished from the earth.\r\nAn idea may assume new forms, may change its mere outward semblance\r\n――for all great ideas are plastic in their attributes and immutable in\r\ntheir essentials――but, once it has been enunciated, human life absorbs\r\nit within itself for ever.\r\n\r\nThe Greek spirit of freedom, and the order, discipline and law of\r\nRome survive in Anglo-Saxon institutions, not by mere enforcement of\r\nvictorious arms, but because men have recognized them as the happiest\r\napproximation to the independence of each and the subordination of all\r\nthat has ever yet been conceived.\r\n\r\nTo Greece was entrusted the cultivation of reason and taste. Her gift\r\nto mankind has been science and art. To the Greeks we owe the science\r\nof logic, which has dominated the minds of all modern thinkers. Much\r\nof the spirit of modern politics, too, comes from Greece. On the other\r\nhand, the sentiments and the organizing force behind all States and\r\nGovernments, which are absolutely indispensable to their vigour, are\r\nto a great extent Roman. Justinian’s¹ laws have penetrated into all\r\nmodern legislation. Thus Greece may be said to have disciplined human\r\nreason and taste, and Rome human organization and power.\r\n\r\n    ¹ Flavius Anicius Julianus Justinian I. [The Great] (483‒565).\r\n\r\nBut England has been influenced by _Israel_ even more than by Hellas\r\nand Latium; by the power and the light of the _Hebrew_ genius――by the\r\nBible.\r\n\r\nThe mission of the _Hebrew_ race was to lay the foundation of morality\r\nand religion on earth. Their works and their Book are great facts\r\nin the history of man; the influence of their mind upon the rest\r\nof mankind has been immense and peculiar. The _Hebrews_ may be said\r\nto have disciplined the human conscience; and to the pages of their\r\nsacred books humanity has turned again and again for new inspiration.\r\n\r\nNo people has been so devotedly attached to the Bible as the English,\r\nand the effect may be traced in all the great movements of English\r\nhistory. The Bible has dominated the whole domestic and political life\r\nof the English people for some centuries, and has provided the basis\r\nof the English conception of personal and political liberty.\r\n\r\nThe education of a large number of Englishmen has consisted mainly in\r\nthe reading of the Scriptures. There is indeed no book, or collection\r\nof books, so rich in teaching or capable of appealing so forcibly\r\nto the unlearned and the learned alike. That the growth and gradual\r\ndiffusion of religious and moral thinking is due to the supreme\r\ninfluence of the Bible is a fact which can be recognized throughout\r\nthe whole of English history. As a single instance, we may take two\r\nwriters who lived at different periods, and dealt with this subject\r\nfrom dissimilar points of view――the Rev. Paul Knell (1615‒1664) and\r\nMatthew Arnold (1822‒1888). Knell compared England with _Israel_. The\r\nname “_Israel_” was used by writers of his age with so much laxity,\r\nthat it is impossible to define the sense which it was generally\r\nintended to convey. It often meant the Religion of _Israel_; at other\r\ntimes it was used as if it was a synonym of the word “Church.” But\r\nKnell used the word in its plain meaning: for him “_Israel_” meant\r\nsimply the People of _Israel_ in the Land of _Israel_ (Appendix ii).\r\nIf we compare the general tone and attitude of Christian preachers\r\nin those times in other countries with the attitude taken up by\r\nthe English clergy, we must acknowledge that the latter have a much\r\ngreater appreciation of the value and dignity of the Jewish people\r\nand of its great influence on the character of the English nation.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all modern developments, and notwithstanding the fact that\r\nmodern science has undermined some of the old beliefs, the fundamental\r\nattitude of Englishmen to the Bible remains unchanged. There is no\r\nneed to quote many writers; it is sufficient to refer to Matthew\r\nArnold, who insists that Righteousness is the burden of Old Testament\r\nteaching, and that this idea has greatly influenced the formation of\r\nthe English character (Appendix iii).\r\n\r\nThe indebtedness of English literature to the Bible is immeasurable.\r\nThe Bible has inspired the highest and most ennobling books in the\r\nEnglish language. No other book has been so universally read or so\r\ncarefully studied. The Bible has been an active force in English\r\nliterature for over twelve hundred years, and during that whole period\r\nit has been moulding the diction of representative English thinkers\r\nand literary men. The Bible is “the book upon which they have been\r\nbrought up,” says Thomas Carlyle (1795‒1881), Nor has its influence on\r\nmen of action been less marked. Englishmen picture Sir Henry Havelock\r\n(1795‒1857) sustaining himself upon the promises of the Bible through\r\nthe darkest hours of the Mutiny; Charles George (Chinese) Gordon\r\n(1833‒1885) writing with his Bible in front of him at Khartoum; and\r\nDavid Livingstone (1813‒1873) in the loneliness of Central Africa\r\nreading it four times through from beginning to end, drawing from\r\nit patience, fortitude and perseverance. One of the mightiest moral\r\nforces of the last century in England, John Ruskin (1819‒1900),\r\nacknowledges his great indebtedness to the Bible. “In religion,” he\r\nsays, “which with me pervaded all the hours of life, I had been moved\r\nby the Jewish ideal, and as the perfect colour and sound gradually\r\nasserted their power on me they seemed finally to agree in the old\r\narticle of Jewish faith that things done delightfully and rightfully\r\nwere always done by the help and spirit of God.”\r\n\r\n“I have before me one of those great old folios in black letter in\r\nwhich the pages, worn by horny fingers, have been patched together,”\r\nwrites Hippolyte Adolphe Taine (1828‒1893), in his _Histoire de la\r\nLittérature Anglaise_ (Paris, 1863‒4).¹... “Hence have sprung much\r\nof the English language and half of the English manners. To this day\r\nthe country is Biblical; it was these big books which had transformed\r\nShakespeare’s England. To understand this great change, try to picture\r\nthese yeomen, these shopkeepers, who in the evening placed this Bible\r\non their table and bareheaded, with veneration, heard or read one\r\nof its chapters. Think that they had no other books, that theirs was\r\na virgin mind, that every impression would make a furrow, that they\r\nopened this book not for amusement but to discover in it their doom of\r\nlife and death.”\r\n\r\n    ¹ _History of English Literature_, by H. A. Taine. Translated\r\n      by H. Van Laun,... Edinburgh:... 1871.... (2 vols.).\r\n\r\n“The Bible stands for so much in England: it is the foundation of\r\nour laws,” said Sir Lewis Tonna Dibdin, “for when you get back behind\r\njudicial decisions and Acts of Parliament you come at the bottom to\r\nthe moral laws, of which the Ten Commandments were the first written\r\nsummary.”\r\n\r\n“The Bible,” says Thomas Henry Huxley (1825‒1895), in his _Essays on\r\nControverted Questions_, “has been the ‘Magna Charta’ of the poor and\r\nthe oppressed.”\r\n\r\nThere is no Christian people even among the Protestant nations which\r\ncould be compared with the English in knowledge of the Old Testament\r\nand in devotion to its teachings. This was the avowed object and the\r\nundeniable result of the English Reformation.\r\n\r\n“Elizabeth (1533‒1603) might silence or tune the pulpits,” says John\r\nRichard Green (1837‒1883), “but it was impossible for her to silence\r\nor tune the great preachers of justice and mercy and truth who spoke\r\nfrom the Book.... The whole temper of the nation was changed. A new\r\nconception of life and of man superseded the old. A new moral and\r\nreligious impulse spread through every class.”\r\n\r\nThis Biblical influence was felt long before the translation of the\r\nBible into English. When King James I. (1566‒1625) in 1604 sanctioned\r\na new translation of the Bible, he let loose moral and spiritual\r\nforces which transformed English life and thought. But before this\r\nthe Renaissance, or revival of learning, had led to the study of the\r\nScriptures and so had helped to make men Puritans.\r\n\r\nThe Pilgrim Fathers crossed the ocean with little more than this\r\nsacred volume in their hands and its spirit in their hearts. The men\r\nwho founded new Commonwealths built up their constitutions upon the\r\nteachings of the Bible; and tradition has long asserted that every\r\nsoldier in Cromwell’s army was provided with a pocket edition, which\r\nconsisted of appropriate quotations from the Scriptures, mostly from\r\nthe Bible of the Jews.¹\r\n\r\n    ¹ Cromwell’s Soldiers’ Bible, London, 1895.\r\n\r\nA close parallel can be drawn between the Puritans, of whom Oliver\r\nCromwell (1599‒1658) was the principal type, and the enthusiasts who\r\nshared with _Judas Maccabæus_ (_ob._ 3628 _a.m._) the dangers and\r\nglories of his illustrious career. Both were stern warriors forced\r\ninto battle by the stress of great principles, and by the strongest\r\nsense of obligation to a sacred cause. Both fought for liberty against\r\ntyranny, against religious persecution and unrighteousness. The\r\nspirit which inspired them all was the secret of the world’s greatest\r\nachievements. The parallel can be traced even further. Cromwell’s life\r\nwas shaped by the influence of the Bible. For a figure to compare with\r\nCromwell we must turn neither to ancient history nor to early English\r\nhistory, but to the pages of Jewish national history in the Bible.\r\nCromwell’s examples were _Joshua_ (2406‒2516 _a.m._), _Gideon_ (_fl._\r\n2676 _a.m._) and _Samuel_ (_ob._ 2882 _a.m._). _Hebrew_ warriors\r\nand prophets were his ideals. And that is not to be wondered at, for\r\nCromwell studied the Bible every day with attention and reverence and\r\nwith a desire to be guided by it. He was an intellectual and spiritual\r\nchild of the Old Testament, and he “imagined himself to be a second\r\n_Phineas_, raised up by Providence to be the scourge of idolatry and\r\nsuperstition.”¹\r\n\r\n    ¹ Daniel Neal (1678‒1743): _History of the Puritans_, vol. iv.\r\n      (1738), p. 187.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n                        THE _HEBREW_ LANGUAGE\r\n\r\n    Its survival and revival――Its influence upon the English\r\n    mind――De Quincey――Bacon――Shakespeare――Milton――Cowley――Taylor\r\n    ――Tillotson――Barrow――Dryden――Parnell――Pope――Addison――Young\r\n    ――Akenside――Gray――Warton――Cowper――Byron――Shelley――Southey\r\n    ――Moore――Sir Thomas Brown[e]――Earl of Clarendon――John Pym\r\n    ――Viscount Falkland――Sir Henry Vane――Earl of Chatham――Browning\r\n    ――Tennyson――John Bright.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE _Hebrew_ language, mysteriously preserved like _Israel_, the\r\npeople after whom it is called, through the tempests of many centuries,\r\npolitically annihilated, but spiritually full of vigour, has never\r\nceased to be a vehicle for the expression of sublime thoughts and\r\nsentiments. Not only in the brilliant epoch of _Hebrew_ literature\r\nin Spain, from the tenth to the fifteenth centuries, but since then,\r\n_Hebrew_ has been written in prose and in poetry with power and effect\r\nunattainable in any of the languages that have ceased to live. It\r\nis entirely wrong to consider _Hebrew_ a dead language. _Hebrew_\r\nhas never been dead. At no time in its long history has it ceased\r\nto be employed by the Jewish people, as a medium for the expression,\r\nwhether in speech or in writing, of the living thoughts and the\r\nliving feelings of the Jew. Its use as a national medium of everyday\r\nspeech came, indeed, to an end with the destruction of the political\r\norganization of the Jewish people. But that catastrophe did not\r\ndestroy the life of the language any more than it destroyed the life\r\nof the nation. The marvellous revival of the _Hebrew_ language in our\r\ntimes in Palestine, which is one of the greatest achievements of the\r\nZionist movement, shows that the language was only neglected, and that\r\nit was essentially a living language.\r\n\r\nThe _Hebrew_ language, with its naturalness and noble simplicity, has\r\nexerted an influence not less powerful than that of Biblical ideas on\r\nthe English mind. Knowing little of artificial forms, it has a natural\r\nsublimity of its own, and a great logical clearness in discriminating\r\nbetween nice shades of meaning. It appeals strongly to the English\r\nmind, because it is the holy language, bringing the Divine Word and\r\ncoming from the sanctuary of that ancient covenant, whose faithful\r\nguardians are the people of _Israel_. The Semitic word has within\r\nhistoric times exercised on the civilisation of the whole human race\r\nan influence to which no parallel can be found, and which, if the\r\nfuture may be measured by the past, is destined triumphantly to extend,\r\nfor the incalculable benefit of mankind, to the uttermost bounds of\r\nthe earth. The poetry of the Bible has no rival.\r\n\r\n“The _Hebrew_ language,” says Thomas De Quincey (1785‒1859), “by\r\nintroducing himself to the secret places of the human heart, and\r\nsitting there as incubator over the awful germs of the spiritualities\r\nthat connect man with unseen worlds, has perpetuated himself as a\r\npower in the human system: _he_ is co-enduring with man’s race, and\r\ncareless of all revolutions in literature or in the composition of\r\nsociety....”¹\r\n\r\n    ¹ De Quincey’s _Works_, vol. ix. _Leaders in Literature_....\r\n      By Thomas De Quincey.... London:... MDCCCLVIII. _Language_,\r\n      p. 81.\r\n\r\nThe _Hebrew_ language deals best with concrete things, and is\r\nessentially personal. In poetry it is best adapted to re-echo the\r\npoet’s own thoughts, and to set forth the various phases of his\r\nintimate experience.\r\n\r\n“Now, this poetry derives its excellence from its great outward\r\nsimplicity: it acknowledges no rule of metrical art. Its poesy is\r\nesoteric, not exoteric. The outward characteristic of _Hebrew_ poetic\r\nstyle is its _parallelism_, or the logical _symmetry_ between two\r\ndistichs of the same verse. The graceful execution of this difficult\r\nproblem――unity of design under a diversity of forms――constitutes the\r\nincomparable charm of _Hebrew_ poetic diction. Parallelism is the law\r\nof perfection. Thought and speech, body and spirit, here and hereafter,\r\nare divinely conceived parallelisms.”¹\r\n\r\n    ¹ _Study of Arabic and Hebrew_, by Tobias Theodores\r\n      (1808‒1886), London, 1860, _p. 23_.\r\n\r\nThe _Hebrew_ language is pre-eminently intuitive, and adapted for\r\nteaching morality and expressing with authority religious and ethical\r\ntruths in brief, pregnant utterances.\r\n\r\nThe best of English literature has been inspired by the _Hebrew_\r\nlanguage of the Bible. Throughout the entire works of Francis Bacon\r\n(1561‒1626)¹ Scriptural influence is sufficiently apparent: but in his\r\nEssays――his favourite work――which he so carefully revised and re-wrote\r\nin the ripeness of his age and experience, and which, therefore,\r\nmay be considered the very cream and essence of his genius, this\r\ncharacteristic element obtains a prominence that cannot fail to strike\r\nevery reader. So natural was it――to borrow a figure of speech from\r\nBacon himself――for his great mind “to turn upon the poles of truth,”\r\nand to revert to its great fountain-head, in support and confirmation\r\nof his own profound conclusions.\r\n\r\n    ¹ 1st Baron Verulam and Viscount St. Albans.\r\n\r\nBut by far the most prominent example of the deference and homage\r\npaid to the Bible will be found in the works of William Shakespeare\r\n(1564‒1616). As he excels in nearly all other points, so also is he\r\ngreatest in this respect. His works are so perfectly impregnated with\r\nthe Bible that we can scarcely open them without encountering one\r\nor other of the Bible’s great truths, assimilated by Shakespeare and\r\nreproduced in words that renew the Bible’s authority and strengthen\r\nits claim upon men’s attention. The influence of the Bible is apparent\r\nnot only in the tone of Shakespeare’s poetry but also in the shape and\r\ncharacter of it.¹ Both the spirit and the letter bear witness to this\r\nfact. The Bible has left its impression not only on Shakespeare’s mind\r\nbut on his idiom, on the exquisite simplicity of his diction, while\r\nhis innumerable allusions, direct and indirect, to Scripture history,\r\npersons, places, events, doctrines, parables, precepts, and even\r\nphrases show a great familiarity with the Bible.² The Reformation\r\nintroduced the same spirit into all the English literature of the\r\nElizabethan era. It was the distinguishing feature of the period, and\r\nnaturally enough culminated in the greatest genius of the time.\r\n\r\n    ¹ It is interesting to note that some of Shakespeare’s plays\r\n      have been rendered in _Hebrew_:――\r\n\r\n      Othello, The Moor of Venice אִיתִּיאֵל הַכּוּשִׁי מִוִינֶעצְיָא Translated into\r\n      _Hebrew_ by J.

Preface, _pp._ xv.‒xvii.\r\n\r\nThe influence of this _Hebrew_ spirit is clearly visible in John\r\nMilton’s (1608‒1674) poetry. “Paradise Lost,”¹ the most glorious\r\ncosmological epic of the world’s literature, could have been written\r\nonly by a man who knew the Bible by heart, and whose verse, when he so\r\nchose, could consist simply and solely of combinations of texts from\r\nthe Bible or images influenced by Biblical ideas. The way in which he\r\ntells his stories, the elevation of his style, the music of his verse,\r\nchanging from the roar of the hurricane and the tramp of bannered\r\nhosts to the hum of bees and the song of birds, the numerous gem-like\r\nphrases and passages which are sure to be quoted for all time――all\r\nthese wonderful qualities are Biblical. Milton knew _Hebrew_, and his\r\nverse is throughout inspired by the genius of that language. And the\r\nspirit which found voice in Milton caused England to take the lead in\r\nbringing about religious liberty. This recognition of righteousness\r\nand fair play among the nations of the world benefited not only the\r\nJewish nation: some months before Manasseh Ben Israel visited England,\r\nthe Commonwealth had made a most vigorous protest against the outrage\r\non humanity perpetrated by the persecutors of Protestants in Piedmont.\r\n\r\n    ¹ Paradise Lost. | A | Poem | Written in | Ten Books | By\r\n      John Milton | Licensed and Entered according | to Order.\r\n      London | Printed, and are to be sold by _Peter Parker_ |\r\n      under _Creed_ Church neer _Aldgate_; And by | _Robert\r\n      Boulter_ at the _Turks Head_ in _Bishopsgate-street_;\r\n      | And _Matthias Walker_, under St. _Dunstons_ Church\r\n      | in Fleet-street, 1667.

We have the authority of Mr. [Joseph]\r\nAddison (1672‒1719) himself for the assertion, that he was fully\r\nsensible of the beauties of the English translation. ‘Our language,’\r\nsays the writer, in the 405th Number of the _Spectator_, ‘has received\r\ninnumerable elegancies and improvements from the infusion of Hebraisms\r\nwhich are derived to it out of the poetical passages of Holy Writ;\r\n――they give a force and energy to our expression, warm and animate our\r\nlanguage, and convey our thought in more ardent and intense phrases\r\nthan any that are to be met with in our own tongue.’ Addison was the\r\nfounder of that pure, classical, and polished style which has, ever\r\nsince the publication of the _Spectator_, been considered as the _ne\r\nplus ultra_ of that manner of writing. Knowing then, as we do, the\r\nsentiments of this accomplished writer, it is not to be supposed\r\nthat he would, in the formation of his own style, have neglected to\r\nborrow largely from that which he praised so much; and thus it appears\r\nprobable that the translation, throughout in this case itself a direct\r\nagent, has yet exercised a beneficial influence upon the prose even of\r\nmodern writers....”\r\n\r\n    ¹ A sacred pastoral first published in the _Spectator_, May\r\n      14th, 1712.

(8º. 1 _l._ + 82 _pp._)\r\n\r\nThis influence of the _Hebrew_ language can be traced not only in\r\nthe masterpieces of great poets; it was also of a general and popular\r\ncharacter. The study of the _Hebrew_ language among Christians,\r\nwhich had only casually and at intervals occupied the attention of\r\necclesiastics during the Middle Ages, received an immense impulse from\r\nthe revived interest in the Bible caused by the Reformation.\r\n\r\nScientific progress in _Hebrew_ was perhaps more considerable in\r\nother countries where the Reformation was gaining ground, but while\r\nin other countries this influence was felt chiefly among scholars, in\r\nEngland the influence has been popular and has been felt in the daily\r\nlife of the nation. The process of enrichment and ennoblement of the\r\nEnglish language has been going on for centuries among all classes\r\nof the population, and one of the chief agencies by which it has\r\nbeen effected is certainly the influence, direct and indirect, of the\r\n_Hebrew_ Bible.\r\n\r\nTo penetrate into the history, prophecy, and poetry of the _Hebrew_\r\nBible, to revere them as the effusion of Divine inspiration, to live\r\nin them with all the emotions of the heart, and yet not to consider\r\n_Israel_, who had originated all this glory and greatness, as the\r\n“Chosen People,” was impossible.¹\r\n\r\n    ¹ Among modern English poets and writers, Robert Browning\r\n      (1812‒1889) was a great friend of the Jews and a good\r\n      _Hebraist_, and very often quoted _Hebrew_ sentences. In a\r\n      letter to a friend Browning wrote:\r\n\r\n      “The _Hebrew_ quotations are put in for a purpose as a\r\n      direct acknowledgment that certain doctrines may be found\r\n      in the Old Book, which the concocters of Novel Schemes of\r\n      Morality put forth as discoveries of their own.”\r\n\r\n      In _Jewish Fancies_ there are many _Hebrew_ phrases, also\r\n      in the _Melon Seller_ and in the _Two Camels_. In _Rabbi\r\n      Ben Ezra_ and _The Doctor_ the reader will find essentially\r\n      Jewish thoughts.\r\n\r\n      Alfred, Lord Tennyson (1809‒1892) also read the Bible in the\r\n      original _Hebrew_. Lady Tennyson (1813‒1896) writes in her\r\n      journal in 1867:\r\n\r\n      “A.” (meaning her husband Alfred) “is reading _Hebrew_\r\n      (_Job_ and the Song of _Solomon_ and _Genesis_). He talked\r\n      much of his _Hebrew_. He brought down to me his psalm-like\r\n      poem ‘Higher Pantheism.’”\r\n\r\n      John Bright’s (1811‒1889) sublime oratory was avowedly based\r\n      on the Bible; from it, not from the classics of Paganism,\r\n      came the inspiration of his highest eloquence. The memorable\r\n      party nickname, “_The Adullamites_,” which he conferred\r\n      on the Liberal seceders on the Franchise Bill in 1866,\r\n      shows his familiarity with the details of Bible history\r\n      and the readiness with which he could adapt his knowledge\r\n      to political illustrations. How minutely he knew the Old\r\n      Testament is apparent to any reader of his speeches.\r\n\r\nHence among the Puritans there were many earnest admirers of “God’s\r\nAncient People,” and Cromwell himself joined in this admiration.\r\nIt was by this Biblical _Hebrew_ movement that public opinion in\r\nEngland had been prepared for a sympathetic treatment of the idea of\r\na readmission of the Jews into England.\r\n\r\n  Illustration: THE CONFERENCE BETWEEN MANASSEH BEN-ISRAEL\r\n                        AND OLIVER CROMWELL (1655)\r\n\r\n                 _From the painting at the Jews’ College,\r\n                       Queen Square House, London_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n              THE RE-ADMISSION OF THE JEWS INTO ENGLAND\r\n\r\n    Manasseh Ben-Israel――Aaron Levi _alias_ Antony Montezinos\r\n    ――Moses Wall――Leonard Busher――David Abrabanel [Manuel Martinez\r\n    Dormido]――Oliver St. John.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANASSEH BEN-ISRAEL (1606‒1657), the Amsterdam Jewish preacher and\r\n_Hebrew_-Spanish author, was the chief promoter of the readmission\r\nof the Jews to England and the leading figure in the history of that\r\ngreat event. He had all the virtues and accomplishments of a leader.\r\nHe was a man of fine intellect and high moral character, unselfish in\r\nthought, word and deed, straightforward and sincere, extraordinarily\r\nendowed and irresistibly attractive, at the same time a faithful\r\nreligious believer and a practical man of action. All the sorrows and\r\nall the hopes of the old Jewish nation were in him, and all the beauty\r\nof the Bible was in his visions.\r\n\r\nManasseh was neither a first-rate _Talmudical_ authority, nor the\r\nprincipal of a great _Rabbinical_ school, nor a celebrated and\r\nofficially recognized leader of _Rabbis_. He achieved nothing striking\r\nin the field of _Halachah_,¹ where alone, according to traditional\r\nviews, authority can be won among learned _Rabbis_ and their followers.\r\nIn high _Rabbinical_ quarters he may have been considered a dilettante\r\nor an eclectic, perhaps a sort of dreamer; and not without justice.\r\nThe “practical” people of the period, again, may have pointed out that\r\nthere was plenty of immediate “practical” work for Manasseh to do in\r\ncongregations, in societies, in charities and in schools among the\r\nPortuguese Jews of the “_Jodenbreestraat_” in Amsterdam, and that he\r\nwould do better if he devoted himself to ordinary local work, instead\r\nof chasing chimeras and planning Utopian schemes in close agreement\r\nwith the Puritan Saints and _Marrano_ travellers. And yet, in spite\r\nof all the immediate needs of the hour, this remarkable man, inspired\r\nby a vision of the lost Ten Tribes of _Israel_, wrote one book after\r\nanother; not the traditional commonplace _Rabbinical_ books dealing\r\nwith questions and details of the conduct of everyday Jewish religious\r\nlife, but books about the past and the future, about the Ten Tribes\r\nand about _Israel_ as a nation――and with an inimitable touch of\r\nmysticism and poetry. He thought that Judaism required something\r\nmore than local activities, that it needed clear-sighted and fearless\r\nself-defence, emancipated from routine, and not localized within the\r\nboundaries of one country. And he not only wrote books in _Hebrew_,\r\nSpanish, and Latin on this subject, but had several of them translated\r\ninto other languages; he also entered into personal relations with\r\nnon-Jewish “dreamers” who had proved by their ideas their intellectual\r\nkinship with him, although they challenged him to controversy on some\r\nessential points. He wrote petitions and proposals, and interfered\r\nto a certain extent with what should, according to some other rabbis,\r\nbe confidingly left to Providence. It had dawned upon him that the\r\nJews should resettle in England, to pave the way for their final\r\nresettlement in Palestine.\r\n\r\n    ¹ Jewish Jurisprudence.\r\n\r\nManasseh was nothing if not a Zionist, if we look upon Zionism in\r\nthe light of his time. He was undoubtedly a dreamer, but one of those\r\ndreamers to whom the word of the Psalmist applies, “... We were like\r\nunto them that dream.”¹ He combined worldly wisdom with the prophetic\r\nspirit. There was some ancient magic about him; there was a deep sense\r\nof religion in all his writings. This religious character enabled\r\nManasseh to stir up Christian England at a time when there was a great\r\nrekindling of the religious consciousness. No wealthy Jew could have\r\ninfluenced England as did this poor _Hebrew_ scholar; no powerful\r\nJewish community could have produced an impression equal to that\r\nproduced by this Jewish dreamer, not only by his boundless activity,\r\ndetermination and persistence, but chiefly because he was an inspired\r\nman. He brought to his task deep religious feeling, and a mind\r\nripened by Jewish historical studies. He thus set himself to perform\r\nwith energy and moral courage an exceedingly responsible service\r\nto the Jewish people, which he carried out with singular fidelity,\r\ninspiration and enthusiasm, as well as with discretion and tact.\r\n\r\n    ¹ Psalms, _chap._ cxxvi., _v._ 1.\r\n\r\nHe sent his brother-in-law, David Abrabanel [Manuel Martinez Dormido]¹\r\nto England in 1654, to present to the Council a petition for the\r\nreadmission of the Jews, and followed up this visit by his own journey\r\nto England, in order to support this petition.\r\n\r\n    ¹ He was a native of Andalusia, Spain, and was imprisoned for\r\n      five years (1627‒1632) by the Inquisition, and tortured,\r\n      together with his wife and her sister. On being released he\r\n      went to Bordeaux, and in 1640 to Amsterdam.\r\n\r\n      In the preliminary leaves of _Thesouro dos Dinim_, by\r\n      Manasseh Ben-Israel, Amsterdam, 5405 (1645), his name\r\n      appears as one of the dedicatees and is described as\r\n      the _Parnas da Sedaká e Talmud Tora_. In 1663 he settled\r\n      here, and in the following year “David ABrabanel dormido”\r\n      appears as one of the signatories to the first _Ascamot_\r\n      of the _Sephardi Kahal_ in London in the year 5424. He died\r\n      2 _Nisan_ 5427, and was interred in the second _carera_ at\r\n      the _Beth Haim_ in the rear of the _Beth Holim_ at Mile End.\r\n\r\nThere were undoubtedly several auxiliary causes which made the\r\nreadmission of the Jews possible, and the general conditions of\r\nthe time and the country were assuredly favourable. Still, the fact\r\nremains that Manasseh’s powerful imaginative impulse and his emotional\r\nMessianic conception were the most important driving force in the\r\nwonderful story of the resettlement of the Jews in England.¹ It is\r\ntrue that he did not succeed in obtaining that formal permission for\r\nthe resettlement which he wanted, but by the publicity of his appeal\r\nhe brought the subject prominently before the ruling minds of England,\r\nand thus indirectly led to the recognition of the fact that there was\r\nnothing in English law against the readmission of the Jews.²\r\n\r\n    ¹ Not that there had not been Jews in England since the\r\n      expulsion. The researches of Sir Sidney Lee and Mr.\r\n      Lucien Wolf have shown that hardly for a single year was\r\n      English soil without Jewish inhabitants, some of them of\r\n      considerable distinction: Dr. Rodrigo Lopez (_ob._ 1594),\r\n      Antonio Fernandez Carvajal (1590?‒1659), Manuel Martinez\r\n      Dormido [David Abrabanel] (_ob._ 1667); but they were\r\n      tolerated only as privileged individuals.\r\n\r\n    ² Mr. Lucien Wolf, to whose researches our knowledge of the\r\n      secret services of Carvajal and his friends to Cromwell and\r\n      the Commonwealth is due, is inclined to give them all the\r\n      credit for the readmission. But it is clear that had not\r\n      public opinion been aroused on the side of Jewish rights,\r\n      nothing could have been done.\r\n\r\nOne can say, without exaggeration, that there was a Biblical and\r\nMessianic idea at the very root of this great event. In effect,\r\nZionism stood at the cradle of the resettlement of the Jews in England.\r\nThis is clear to everybody who has studied Manasseh’s writings,\r\nparticularly in the original _Hebrew_, the language in which he can\r\nbest be understood and appreciated. His favourite idea was that the\r\nreturn of the Jews to their ancient land must be preceded by their\r\ngeneral dispersion. The Dispersion, according to the words of the\r\nBible, was to be from one end of the earth to the other, and must\r\ntherefore include the British Isles, which lay in the extreme north\r\nof the inhabited world. Manasseh made no secret of his Messianic\r\nhopes, because he could and did reckon upon the fact that the “Saints”\r\nor Puritans wished for the “assembling of God’s people” in their\r\nancestral home and were inclined to help and promote it.\r\n\r\nWhat was the difference between Manasseh and other _Rabbis_? No\r\n_Rabbi_ could fail to be well acquainted with the familiar prophecies\r\nof the Bible, and to know that the Dispersion was to be from one end\r\nof the earth to the other. Are not these prophecies quoted in the\r\nJewish daily prayers, prayers that have been lost unheard, as it seems,\r\nin the dark depths of 2000 years of dispersion, and are known to every\r\nJewish child? Or did not the _Rabbis_ cherish those Messianic hopes\r\nwhich inspired Manasseh? There was only one difference: the difference\r\nbetween passivity and activity, between purely spiritual impulses and\r\nimpulses which lead to action. If the dispersion has to be complete,\r\nlet Providence make it complete――this was the usual point of view.\r\nThose who merely believed declined to do anything, as they did not\r\nwish to face the danger of failure. They lived on that, of which other\r\nnations die――on sorrow. Their melancholy had much of majesty in it,\r\nbut it led to nothing and ended in nothing. They dared not attempt\r\nto penetrate into the secrets of the Almighty; for God alone can see\r\nwhat will happen, and no man can avoid his destiny. They refused to\r\nundertake any effort for the readmission of their brethren not only\r\ninto Palestine, but even into England. They were believers, not men of\r\naction. Manasseh took matters into his own hands. He not only believed,\r\nhe acted in accordance with his belief. He collected evidence with\r\njudicious care, weighing and measuring difficulties, keeping facts\r\ncalmly before his mind, studying the facts of the dispersion with\r\ninterest and zeal. He occupied himself with Messianism more than any\r\nJewish scholar since _Don_ Isaac _de_ Judah Abrabanel (1437‒1508), and\r\nmore effectively than the latter, because of the active character of\r\nhis plans.\r\n\r\nIn his מקוה ישראל, _Esperança de Israel_ (Appendix iv), Manasseh relates\r\nhow the _Marrano_ traveller, Aaron Levi, _alias_ Antony Montezinos,\r\nwhile travelling in South America, had met a race of natives in the\r\nCordilleras, who recited the _Shema_, practised Jewish ceremonies, and\r\nwere, in short, Israelites of the tribe of _Reuben_. Montezinos had\r\nrelated his story to Manasseh, and had even embodied it in a sworn\r\naffidavit before the heads of the Amsterdam Synagogue. Montezinos’\r\nstory seemed to be a proof of the increasing dispersion of _Israel_.\r\n_Daniel_ (xii. 7) had foretold in his prophecies that the dispersion\r\nof the Jewish people would be the forerunner of their restoration.\r\n\r\n“And the Lord shall scatter thee among all peoples, from the one end\r\nof the earth even unto the other end of the earth;...” (Deuteronomy\r\nxxviii. 64).\r\n\r\nIt was clear from Montezinos’ and other travellers’ reports that the\r\nJews had already reached one end of the earth. “Let them enter England\r\nand the other end would be reached.” In this sense Manasseh wrote\r\nhis book, which, at the instigation of John Dury (1596‒1680) was\r\ntranslated into English by the Puritan Moses Wall,¹ from the Latin\r\nversion (Appendix v), of the original Spanish under the title of _The\r\nHope of Israel_ (Appendix vi), which produced a profound impression\r\nthroughout England. It was followed in the next few years by two other\r\ntracts by Manasseh, _The Humble Addresses_ [1655] (Appendix vii) and\r\n_Vindiciæ Judæorum_ [1656] (Appendix viii).\r\n\r\n    ¹ “... Moses Wall, of Causham or Caversham in Oxfordshire, a\r\n      scholar and Republican opinionist, of whom there are traces\r\n      in Hartlib’s correspondence and elsewhere.” (_Life of John\r\n      Milton_, by David Masson (1822‒1907), vol. v., 1877, _pp._\r\n      601‒2).\r\n\r\n      See also _The Diary and Correspondence of Dr. John\r\n      Worthington_ (1618‒1671).

It is a well-known\r\nfact that the recognition of religious liberty in England was\r\ndue chiefly to the struggle between the True Believers and other\r\nNonconformists. The Reformation had granted only a limited form of\r\nreligious liberty: when the True Believers themselves began to be\r\npersecuted the demand for religious liberty became very strong. The\r\nearliest pamphlet on this subject, by Leonard Busher, published in\r\n1614,¹ had already demanded religious liberty for the Jews as well.\r\n\r\n    ¹ Religious | Peace: | Or, | A Plea for Liberty of |\r\n      Conscience. | Long since presented to King _James_, | and\r\n      the High Court of Parliament then | sitting, by _Leonard\r\n      Busher_ Citizen of _London_, and Printed in the Yeare 1614.\r\n      | Wherein is contained certain Reasons against | Persecution\r\n      for Religion, Also a designe for | peaceable reconciling of\r\n      those that differ in opinion. | ...

The intercourse was continuous,\r\nand did much to dispel the mutual prejudices which old enmities had\r\ncreated and ignorance had nourished. Intimacies were formed which\r\nproved salutary to both, particularly to the Saints. Manasseh was also\r\non terms of intimacy with Oliver St. John (1598?‒1673), the English\r\nAmbassador in Holland (1651), who was afterwards a member of the\r\nCommittee selected to consider the readmission of the Jews into\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n                         MANASSEH BEN-ISRAEL\r\n\r\n    Manasseh as a Jewish _Rabbi_ and as a _Hebrew_ writer――His\r\n    activity as a publisher and corrector of _Hebrew_ books――The\r\n    Bible editions, the Psalms and the _Mishnah_――Manasseh’s\r\n    connection with _Safed_ in Palestine――_Enseña a Pecadores_\r\n    ――The influence of _Rabbi_ Isaiah _ben_ Abraham Horwitz\r\n    ――Solomon _de_ Oliveyra――Manasseh’s _De Termino Vitae_――The\r\n    Influence of _Don_ Isaac Abrabanel――The Lost Ten Tribes and\r\n    the_Marranos_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE literature concerning Manasseh, which is chiefly in English, but\r\npartly also in Dutch, German, _Hebrew_ and Spanish, is very rich in\r\ndetail and affords an accurate and thorough insight into Manasseh’s\r\nintellectual relationship to contemporary Christian scholars and\r\nstatesmen, and extensive information as to his writings in defence\r\nof Judaism, his missions, _etc._ The Jewish Historical Society of\r\nEngland has played a prominent part in the researches on the subject\r\nby arranging lectures and publishing excellent papers, and the ground\r\nhas been covered on the whole very thoroughly. There is, however,\r\none point which has not yet been sufficiently elucidated, _viz._,\r\nManasseh’s attitude as a Jewish _Rabbi_ and as a _Hebrew_ writer.\r\nHis literary communications with Christian divines, his apologetic\r\nwritings in Spanish and Latin, and his Spanish translations present\r\nafter all only one view of his individuality and activity, the view\r\nseen by the outside world. If, however, we wish to describe Manasseh\r\nin his private, inner life, and to understand his particular views and\r\nmethods, we have to leave the apologist and the polyglot translator\r\nand to discover the author when he writes for his nation in the\r\nnational language. Here, and only here, we discover the Jewish scholar\r\nin his originality.\r\n\r\nIn this connection we meet Manasseh as publisher or corrector\r\n(proof reader) of his three partial and complete Bible editions:\r\n(1) _Chamisha Chumshé Thora_, Amsterdam, 1631; (2) _Sefer T’hillim_\r\n(Psalterium Hebraicum ex recens. Manasseh, _etc._), Amsterdam, 1634;\r\n(3) _Esrim V’arba_ (Biblia Hebraica), Amsterdam, 1639.\r\n\r\nThese books were edited by Manasseh with great care and fine judgment.\r\nHeer J. M. Hillesum, the scholarly librarian of the Bibliotheca\r\nRosenthaliana (Universiteits――Bibliotheek, Amsterdam), supposes that\r\nthe first _Hebrew_ book printed in Amsterdam¹ was the “Daily Prayers”\r\naccording to the Spanish rite dated January, 1627, and edited by\r\nManasseh.² Whatever view may be taken of this assumption, it is,\r\nat all events, certain that Manasseh was one of the pioneers of\r\nAmsterdam _Hebrew_ printing, which will for ever have a distinguished\r\nplace in the annals of _Hebrew_ publications. He not only displayed\r\nartistic taste worthy of the friend of Rembrandt in creating the first\r\nspecimens of beautiful _Hebrew_ books, but by the precision of his\r\ncorrections he proved himself an excellent _Hebrew_ grammarian. It\r\nmust be borne in mind that _Hebrew_ grammarians among the _Rabbis_\r\nof his time were seldom met with, and found only among scholars of a\r\nsomewhat progressive type.\r\n\r\n    ¹ Het eerste te Amsterdam gedrukte Hebreeuwsche Boek.\r\n      Verbeterde overdruk uit maanblad “_Achawah_” van 1 Februari\r\n      _en_ 1 Maart 1910 (No. 185 _en_ 186) by Heer J.

As we gather from the\r\npreface, manuscripts of the _Mishnah_ were brought from “the town\r\nwhich is full of Scholars and writers, _Safed_ in the Land of _Israel_,\r\nmay God rebuild it soon!”\r\n\r\n    ¹ יעקב ספיר איש ירושלים is inscribed on the preliminary leaves of the\r\n      British Museum copy. He was known as _Eben Sappir_, _Rabbi_,\r\n      Author and Traveller. Born in Russia 1822 and died in\r\n      _Jerusalem_ 1886.\r\n\r\nIn the course of our inquiry we shall show that Manasseh was in close\r\ntouch with the Holy Land; here attention is called only to the fact\r\nthat in this editorial work Manasseh was actuated by a desire to\r\ncompare the various manuscripts. These _Mishnaioth_ are a wonderful\r\npocket edition, containing the text without any commentary, and\r\nevidently destined for repetition. _Talmud_ students will find here\r\na good many instructive variants.\r\n\r\nAnother book edited by Manasseh, though it is merely a translation,\r\nthrows some light on the tendencies of the time and on Manasseh’s\r\nJewish connections. This is the _Libro Yntitulado Enseña a\r\nPecadores_.¹ (Appendix ix). This little book contains, in addition\r\nto a translation of a prayer composed by _Rabbi_ Isaac (1534‒1572)\r\n_ben_ Solomon [Ashkenazi] Luria, a translation of a section of\r\n_Rabbi_ Isaiah (1555‒1630) _ben_ Abraham Horwitz’s _Sepher Shné Luchot\r\nHa’brith_ ... Amsterdam ... 5409. The author’s name has come down\r\nto posterity by the initials of his great work “S. L. H.”² with\r\nthe attribute _Hakadosh_.³ He was _Rabbi_ in Frankfort-on-the-Main,\r\nPrague, Posen, and Cracow, and then went to the Holy Land, where\r\nhe was called מרא דארץ ישראל‎⁴ His _Shné Luchot Ha’brith_ is a work of\r\nadmirable erudition in the _Agadah_ (Legend, Saga) of the _Talmud_,\r\nas well as in homiletics and _Cabbalah_. _Rabbi_ Isaiah Horwitz was a\r\nreligiously inspired Zionist. His enthusiasm in expounding the glory\r\nof the Holy Land (_Shné Luchot Ha’brith_, _p._ 275, sermon to _Lech\r\nL’cha_, and _p._ 389, sermon to _Va’etchanan_) was almost unique in\r\nthe literature of that time. He combined moreover a rare religious\r\necstasy and _Cabbalistic_ visions with progressive ideas on education,\r\nin which he recommended a systematic method, contrary to the customs\r\nof that time――a tendency also found in Manasseh. _Rabbi_ Isaiah lived\r\nto an advanced age, and his activities came to an end in the Holy\r\nLand. His manuscript was brought to Amsterdam and published there,\r\nwith additions by his son David, who was also a distinguished scholar.\r\nThis book seems to have impressed Manasseh so much that he published\r\na translation of a part of it, containing prayers and contemplations\r\nfor repentant sinners, evidently for _Marranos_, for whom a great\r\nmany prayer-books and religious tracts were published at that time in\r\nSpanish and Portuguese.\r\n\r\n    ¹ Instruction for Sinners.\r\n\r\n    ² Pronounced “_Shloh_.”\r\n\r\n    ³ The Saint.\r\n\r\n    ⁴ Lord of the Land of _Israel_.\r\n\r\nThis book, while proving the fact of Manasseh’s connection with a\r\ngreat Palestinian authority, shows also that he was in touch with\r\nthe _Hebrew_ poet and grammarian, _Haham Ribi_ Solomon¹ _de_ David\r\n_de_ Israel _d_’Oliveyra, the author of _Sharshot Gabluth_――_Ayeleth\r\nAhabim_, which were both published in Amsterdam in the year 5425\r\n[1665], and many other books and treatises on _Hebrew_ poetry. He\r\nis considered to be one of the precursors of the revival of modern\r\n_Hebrew_ literature in Holland, and wrote poems and compositions of\r\na didactic character. In the course of our inquiry we shall discover\r\nthat Manasseh himself had a great predilection for _Hebrew_ poetry.\r\nEmbodied in the _Enseña a Pecadores_ is a “Confession of Penitence”\r\ncomposed by _Haham d_’Oliveyra in _Hebrew_ וידוי כפרה and Portuguese\r\n[_♦Viduy Penetencial_], which includes a prayer for the rebuilding of\r\nthe “Holy City,” using the Biblical phrase:――תבנה חומות ירושלים _Fabricarás\r\nmurallas de Yerusalaim_.\r\n\r\n    ¹ _Ob._ 23 May, 1708, at Amsterdam.\r\n\r\n    ♦ “Vidvy” replaced with “Viduy”\r\n\r\nAnother work of Manasseh in Latin, _De Termino Vitae_, Amsterdam,\r\n1639 (Appendix x), was written with the object of answering a question\r\nwhich was addressed by his friend the Christian scholar Jan _van_\r\nBeverwijck [Johannes Beverovicius] (1594‒1647) to various divines\r\nand scholars, and is, consequently, apologetic in character. But\r\ntwo passages throw some light on Manasseh’s views as to the Land of\r\n_Israel_ and Messianism. In one of them he emphasizes the fact that\r\nthe Jews frequently collect alms for those who live in the Holy Land;¹\r\nand in the other he says that “if anyone desires to know all the\r\ncontroversies of the Jews concerning the explanation of _Daniel’s_\r\n(_fl._ 3389 _a.m._) Prophecies, he may read Abrabanel’s Treatise,\r\nwhich the learned Johannes Buxtorf II. (1599‒1664) has translated into\r\nLatin.”² In this way he identifies himself with the ideas expounded\r\nby Abrabanel in his _Mayy’neh Hayeshuah_, which showed that Abrabanel\r\nwas not only Messianistic in the usual sense, but was firmly convinced\r\nthat the end of the Captivity might be expected in the near future.\r\n\r\n    ¹ “_Hinc etiam in Synagogis Hebraeorum ... vel eorum qui\r\n      terram sanctum incolunt...._” (De Termino Vitae, _p._ 103).\r\n\r\n    ² _Ibid._, _p._ 184.\r\n\r\nManasseh was a _Hebrew_ grammarian concerned with the correctness of\r\nancient sacred texts, and an editor of keen discrimination. In his\r\nscholarly work he kept in close touch with the scholars of _Safed_;\r\nhe was moreover influenced by the religious Zionistic enthusiasm\r\nof _Rabbi_ Isaiah Horwitz. In his Messianic hopes he was a disciple\r\nof Abrabanel, and he highly appreciated the modern though religious\r\n_Hebrew_ poetry of his time, which poetry he introduced in his\r\ndevotional book as a _Viduy_, concluding with an apotheosis of _Zion_\r\nand _Jerusalem_.\r\n\r\nRegarded from the point of view of these ideas, Manasseh of the\r\n“_Conciliador_” appears to us in his proper light. Broad-minded,\r\nhighly accomplished, interested in all the discoveries of his time――an\r\nimportant period for discoveries――he sincerely believed in Montezinos’\r\nreport concerning his distant brethren, while, on the other hand, his\r\ngreat devotion to Palestine and his belief in Abrabanel’s predictions\r\nmade the question of the Lost Ten Tribes for him not one of curiosity\r\nbut one of vital importance for the national salvation. _Judah\r\nand Israel_ are to return――where, then, is _Israel_? Is the Return\r\nthinkable so long as _Israel_ is lost? All the legends concerning the\r\n_Sambatyon_ and the various reports of Eldad _ben_ Mahli Ha’dani (_fl._\r\n9th century) concerning the tribe of Dan and the “Sons of Moses” who\r\nlive somewhere as an independent, strong nation, were essentially the\r\nreflex of a powerful national aspiration. The descendants of _Judah_,\r\n_Benjamin_ and half of the tribe of _Manasseh_ felt themselves too\r\nweak, too humiliated and too few in number to achieve the great\r\nwork of Restoration, but believing as they did in the impossibility\r\nof the disappearance of the ancient nation, they were sure that\r\nthe descendants of _Israel_, uniting with and absorbed by other\r\nnations though they might be at present, would one day be awakened\r\nto consciousness as to their origin and join _Judah_ in repopulating\r\nthe ♦Holy Land. This is the reason why they were so fascinated by the\r\nreports respecting the Lost Ten Tribes. Is it to be wondered at that\r\n_Marranos_ were particularly ready to believe in this miracle? Were\r\nthey not themselves like one of the Lost Ten Tribes in that, after\r\nall the tortures of the Inquisition, and after having apparently been\r\nultimately denationalized, converted and absorbed, they had reasserted\r\nthemselves and were now awakening to a new Jewish revival? Considering\r\nthat these aspirations happened to coincide with the hope for the\r\nRestoration and the rediscovery of the Lost Ten Tribes, in which\r\nreformed Christianity, and especially the Puritans, believed, we\r\ncan fully realize the popularity which Manasseh’s ideas had gained\r\nin these circles, and we can quite understand how they led to the\r\nreadmission of the Jews to England.\r\n\r\n    ♦ “Loly” replaced with “Holy”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n                    MANASSEH’S _NISHMATH CHAYYIM_\r\n\r\n    The most important of his Hebrew writings――Quotations from\r\n    Gebirol, Bedersi, _R._ Kalonymus, _R._ Zerahiah Ha’levi, and\r\n    others――Plato, Aristotle and Philo――_Cabbalistic_ ideas――_R._\r\n    Isaac Luria――Miracles and Christian Saints――Manasseh’s Jewish\r\n    Nationalism――“The Jewish Soul”――The _Zohar_――_R._ Jehudah\r\n    Ha’levi――The holiness of the Land of _Israel_――_R._ David\r\n    Carcassone, the messenger from Constantinople.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE most important of Manasseh’s _Hebrew_ writings, though it is only\r\nalluded to incidentally, or dismissed with derisive criticism in some\r\nbiographies, was his _Nishmath Chayyim..._,¹ Amsterdam, 1651 (Appendix\r\nxi). Sarcastic observations have been made with regard to the legends\r\nand superstitions with which this book abounds. It is true that the\r\nbook contains many legends and superstitious beliefs; but that is just\r\nwhy, from a literary point of view, it contributes far more to a real\r\nknowledge of Manasseh than the writings in which he advocated certain\r\ncauses as apologist or translator. In this book we get Manasseh\r\nhimself, a national Jew, preaching to his brethren in the national\r\nlanguage. A careful study of the book in the original, with its\r\npeculiar style, its wide range of allusion, and its distinctive spirit,\r\ngives us a clear idea of Manasseh’s religious views, his Jewish\r\nnational self-consciousness, or――to use the modern term――his Zionism.\r\n\r\n    ¹ “The Breath of Life”: on the existence of the soul, the\r\n      future life, _etc._\r\n\r\nThe book is a careful compilation, skilfully put together and well\r\nchosen in every part. Though somewhat florid in certain portions, it\r\nis on the whole excellently written. Its style reminds one of that of\r\nAbrabanel, with a touch of _R._ Isaac (1402?‒1494) _ben_ Moses Arama.\r\nThe author often quotes poetical sentences of Solomon (1021?‒1058)\r\n_ben_ Judah Ibn Gabirol [Abu Ayyub Sulaiman Ibn Yahya Ibn Jabirul],\r\nknown as Avicebron: _R._ Jedaiah (1270?‒1340?) _ben_ Abraham Bedersi\r\n[Bedaresi].¹ Kalonymos (1286‒_post_ 1328) _ben_ Kalonymos _ben_ Meir\r\n[Maestro Calo]; Zerahiah (1131?‒1186?) _ben_ Isaac Ha’levi Gerondi,\r\nand others, and thus shows himself well versed not only in the ancient\r\ntexts, but also in the beauties of comparatively recent _Hebrew_\r\npoetry.\r\n\r\n    ¹ He quotes Bedersi also in _De Termino Vitae_: “Quando\r\n      aspicis coelum, quod supra te est”――with the _Hebrew_\r\n      original (_p._ 17).\r\n\r\nManasseh’s argument aims at proving that the immortality of the\r\nsoul is an old _Biblical_ as well as a _Talmudical_, _Rabbinical_\r\nand _Cabbalistic_ principle. He defines the _Nefesh_ (Soul) as the\r\ninternal ultimate principle by which man thinks, feels and wills. The\r\nterm _Ruach_ (Mind) denotes this principle as the subject of man’s\r\nconscious state, while _Nefesh_ denotes it as the source of man’s\r\nphysical activities as well. The question of the reality of the soul\r\nand its separate existence apart from the body is for him one of\r\nthe most important problems of religion, for with it is bound up the\r\ndoctrine of a future life. He knows Plato (427?‒347? _b.c.e._),\r\nAristotle (384‒322 _b.c.e._) and Philo (20? _b.c.e._‒_post_ 40\r\n_c.e._). It is well known that Mysticism shares to a great extent\r\nthe ideas of the system of Plato, _e.g._ in his theory of the world\r\nof ideas, of the origin of the world-soul and the human soul. The\r\ntwo standpoints, the cosmological and the epistemological, are\r\nfound combined in Plato. In the _Phædo_ the chief argument for\r\nthe immortality of the soul is based on the nature of intellectual\r\nknowledge interpreted by the theory of memory; this of course implies\r\nthe pre-existence of the soul. This doctrine developed into an extreme\r\nTranscendentalism. Aristotle, on the other hand, emphasized the\r\nintimacy of the union of body and soul. The difficulty in his theory\r\nis to determine what degree of distinctness or separateness from the\r\nmatter of the body is to be conceded to the human soul. He fully\r\nrecognizes the spiritual element in thought, and describes the “active\r\nintellect” as separate, but the precise relation of this “active\r\nintellect” to the individual mind was an obscure point in his theory.\r\nPhilo combined the Platonic theory with the data of the Bible, and\r\ntaught that every man, by freeing himself from matter and receiving\r\nillumination from God, may reach the mystic, ecstatic or prophetic\r\nstate, where he is absorbed in the Divinity. The Stoics taught that\r\nall existence is material, and described the soul as a breath\r\npervading the body. They also called it Divine, a particle of God.\r\nManasseh’s system is a syncretism of the ideas of Plato, Philo and\r\nthe Stoics, while he rejects the Aristotelian ideas. He endeavours\r\nto prove that Moses Maimonides (1135‒1204) did not follow the\r\ngreat Peripatetic, and opposes the commentator of Maimonides’\r\n_Moreh-Nebuchim_ Moses (_fl. 14th cent._) _ben_ Joshua Narboni\r\n[Mestre Vidal], in a somewhat forced dialectical manner.\r\n\r\nAccepting on these grounds the pre-existence of the soul, the\r\ncontinuance of the soul in the world to come, and reincarnation, he\r\ncomes to the _Cabbalah_, quotes the _Zohar_, and declares himself\r\na disciple of _R._ Isaac Luria. According to the _Zohar_, man is\r\ncomposed of three things: Life, or _Nefesh_, Spirit, which is _Ruach_,\r\nand Soul, which is _Neshamah_. By this man becomes a _Ruach Chajah_\r\n(Living Spirit).¹ Manasseh’s doctrine may be summarized as follows:――\r\n\r\n    ¹ See _p._ 157, _The Secret Doctrine in Israel_, by A. E.\r\n      Waite, 1913.\r\n\r\n(1) The human soul is endowed with special gifts fitting it for\r\nan intimate union with the Divinity――the Stoic “particle of God,”\r\ncorresponding to the _Hebrew_ “_Chelek Eloha Mimaal_”;\r\n\r\n(2) The gifts or graces through which every man is equipped for his\r\nperfection form his Life, Spirit and Soul into an organized whole,\r\nwhose parts are knit together;\r\n\r\n(3) Through contemplation and piety the human soul enters into that\r\nhigher heavenly soul, into the mystical cosmos whose parts are united\r\nin divine eternity. This is, to his mind, the meaning of the Biblical\r\nteaching that man is made in the image and likeness of God.\r\n\r\nThe _Cabbalistic_ ideas once accepted, Manasseh accepts also the\r\ntransmigration of souls, physical resurrection, expelling of demons,\r\nand so on. He indulges in theosophical visions and metaphysical\r\nspeculations. All these seem strange from a modern point of view,\r\nbut he should be considered in the light of his time. He believed\r\nin miracles. Did not the Fathers of the Christian Church believe in\r\nthem? Origen (185?‒253(4)) says that he has seen examples of demons\r\nexpelled.¹ St. Athanasius (293‒373) writes in the Life of St. Anthony\r\n(251(2)‒356(7)) from what he himself saw and heard from one who had\r\nlong been in attendance on the saint. Justin Martyr (100?‒163‒7), in\r\nhis second apology to the Roman Senate appeals to miracles wrought\r\nin Rome and well attested. Tertullian (155?‒222?) challenges the\r\nheathen magistrates to work the miracles which the Christians perform²;\r\nSt. Augustine (354‒430) gives a long list of extraordinary miracles\r\nwrought before his own eyes, mentioning names and particulars. And\r\neven in the time of the Reformation, did not Johann _von_ Reuchlin\r\n(1455‒1522) adhere to _Cabbalistic_ mysticism in his _De arte\r\ncabalistias_ and _De verbo mirifico_? Paradoxical as it may seem at\r\nfirst sight, Manasseh even in his metaphysical beliefs was somewhat\r\nof a rationalist, in the sense that he accepted only evidence of\r\ntrustworthy authority. The _Safed_ authorities, who were supposed to\r\nhave witnessed the miracles of Luria, of course impressed him in the\r\nsame way as Montezinos’ reports, because they were in harmony with his\r\ntheory. At any rate, it is characteristic of his way of thinking that\r\nhe was anxious to build upon facts and evidence.\r\n\r\n    ¹ _c. Celsum_, i. 2.\r\n\r\n    ² _Apol._, xxiii.\r\n\r\nWe have had to wander to some extent into a domain outside our\r\nprovince in order to appreciate fully Manasseh’s general ideas.\r\nHis Jewish nationalism, which is for us the principal point, can be\r\nunderstood only in connection with his whole system of ideas. This\r\nnationalism is outspoken in the _Nishmath Chayyim_. What we, in modern\r\nlanguage, call race, national (from _natus_――_natio_) individuality,\r\n_i.e._ what the Jew is by himself, by the fact of being born a Jew,\r\nis termed by Manasseh “the Jewish soul.” His system is rooted in\r\nhis faith in the excellency of the Jewish soul, which is a profound\r\nact of homage to the race; that is the point of view from which he\r\nregards Jewish history. History, he thinks――and in this point again\r\nhe is guided by the evidence of historical facts――bears witness to\r\nthe beneficial influence that the soul of _Israel_, or――more precisely\r\n――the _Israelitish_ soul, has exerted on the intellectual life of\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nOn this point he is even carried away by his imagination to make\r\nexaggerated statements of the following kind, again backed up by\r\nauthorities: “It is a truth confirmed by innumerable writers, that\r\nall the learning of the Greeks and Egyptians was derived from the\r\nJews: Justin Martyr, Clement of Alexandria (150?‒213?) and Theodoret\r\n(386?‒247) assert that all the best philosophers and poets owe their\r\nlearning to the Holy Scriptures, for which reason they call Plato the\r\n‘Attic _Moses_’; the ‘Athenian _Moses_.’ Clearchus the Peripatetic\r\n(320 _b.c.e._) writes that Aristotle gained most of his learning from\r\na Jew with whom he had much conversation; Ambrose (340?‒397) writes\r\nthat Pythagoras (_fl._ 540‒510 _b.c.e._) was by origin a Jew, and like\r\na pilferer robbed them of many things; Cornelius Alexander Polyhistor\r\n(80 _b.c.e._) writes that he was a disciple of the prophet Ezekiel\r\n(_fl._ 3332 _a.m._). Lastly, it is certain that Orpheus (_14th_ or\r\n_13th cent. b.c.e._), Plato, Anaxagoras (500‒428 _b.c.e._) Pythagoras,\r\nthe Milesian Thales (640‒546 _b.c.e._), Homer (_fl._ 962‒927 _b.c.e._)\r\nand many other very learned men, derived their knowledge from the wide\r\nocean of the knowledge of _Moses_ (2368‒2488 _a.m._) and the Sages and\r\nprofessors of his most Holy Law; for, according to the Psalmist,\r\n\r\n    “He declareth His word unto Jacob, ...” (Psalm cxlvii. 19).\r\n\r\n    “He hath not dealt so with any nation; ...” (_Ibid._ 20).\r\n\r\nIn his preface to _Nishmath Chayyim_ he makes this statement in a\r\nmore general form, saying that “wherever he quoted the non-Jewish\r\nauthorities, he wanted only to show that most of their teachings were\r\nderived from our ancient sources.” He repeats that “Pythagoras was a\r\nJew, and all he taught and wrote was copied from our Holy Law and true\r\nTradition” (_fol. 171a_), and that “Plato had learned the teachings of\r\nour prophet _Jeremiah_” (_fol. 171b_) (_fl._ 3298 _a.m._). Not that he\r\nwas lacking in love and consideration for other nations. Far from it:\r\non the contrary, he lays stress upon the sentence of the _Mishnah_,\r\nthat the pious men even of heathen nations have their share in the\r\nfuture life, inasmuch as they observe the Seven Commandments of the\r\n_Noahides_; and, needless to say, he highly respected Christianity,\r\nand was practically the first _Hebrew_ author who quoted so often and\r\nwith such great reverence the authority of the Christian Church. Even\r\nwhen he speaks of the Spanish Inquisition, of which his father was one\r\nof the tortured victims, no word of contempt or hostility escapes his\r\npen, although, living in Holland, and dealing almost exclusively with\r\nthe adherents of the Reformation, he could have expressed his ideas\r\non this subject quite frankly. But, nevertheless, he is convinced that\r\n“God gave to the _Israelitish_ soul a very special grace, by which\r\nit is enabled to feel his sensible presence,” that “the _Israelites_\r\nare and have to remain a distinct nation, having essentially the\r\nprerogative of sanctifying life,” and he continually quotes and\r\nillustrates the Biblical verses:――\r\n\r\n   “... Blessed be ... Israel, Mine inheritance”\r\n                                              (Isaiah xix. 25).\r\n\r\n   “... Israel is the tribe of his inheritance;...”\r\n                                              (Jeremiah x. 16).\r\n\r\n   “And who is like Thy people, like Israel, a nation one in the\r\n      earth,...”                              (2 Samuel vii. 23).\r\n\r\nas well as several passages of the _Zohar_, which emphasize the\r\nparticular dignity of the Jewish soul, and _R._ Judah (1085(6)‒_post_\r\n1140) _ben_ Samuel Ha’levi’s [Abu al-Hasan al-Lawi] well-known views,\r\nexpounded in the _Kuzari_ (_chap._ i., _par._ 46):――\r\n\r\n   “The Israelites are favoured, for God gives them holy souls.”\r\n\r\nThis sentence from the _Zohar_ is the keynote of Manasseh’s teachings,\r\nand his favourite phrase when he speaks of all _Israel_ is,\r\n\r\n   “... shall ... surname himself by the name of Israel”\r\n                                              (Isaiah xliv. 5).\r\n\r\nWhenever he means to lay stress on Jewish origin, without distinction\r\nof country, party, school, _etc._ (a significant allusion also to\r\nthe _Marranos_), he uses this phrase. If we add that he emphasizes\r\nthe holiness of Palestine, enumerating the seven degrees of sanctity,\r\nexplains the desire of pious men to find their rest after death\r\nin Palestinian soil by the fact that the _Shechina_ will dwell in\r\nthe Holy Land, and so on――we can realize the depth of his national\r\nPalestinian enthusiasm. His devoted attachment to the cause of his\r\npersecuted brethren is expressed when he speaks of _Rabbi_ David\r\nCarcassone, the messenger from Constantinople, “who came to our city\r\nto collect funds for the relief of our brethren who had fallen a year\r\nbefore into the hands of the Cossacks, ... may God send His angel\r\nbefore him” (_fol. 173b_)――referring to the massacres in Poland, 1648.\r\nThe most interesting reference to his propaganda among Christians on\r\nbehalf of the Restoration is made in his preface, where he relates\r\nthat towards morning he had a vision: “And I raised my eyes and I saw\r\nbehold an Angel touched me and said unto me ... I have given thee for\r\na light to the Nations in the book which thou hast written about the\r\nTen Tribes to possess desolated heritages....”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n                       SOME OF MANASSEH’S VIEWS\r\n\r\n    The massacres of Podolia――The _Marrano_ Tragedy――Manasseh’s\r\n    views on the mission of _Israel_――Dispersion and Restoration\r\n    ――_R._ Jacob Emden’s annotations――Manasseh’s theory of the\r\n    Jewish race.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE frightful massacres of the Jewish communities in Podolia, Volhynia,\r\nand other provinces of Poland, entirely startled and horrified Jewry\r\nall over the world. For months and years the murder of the Jews went\r\non. No language can describe the cruelties and sufferings inflicted\r\nupon this unfortunate people from the Dnieper to the Vistula. There\r\nwas “a kind of chase taking place within an enclosed area.” Some of\r\nthe aged and prominent Jews were kept as hostages in the hands of\r\nthe mob, who demanded heavy ransoms from the Jews of other countries.\r\nThis was the purpose of Carcassone’s mission from Constantinople to\r\nAmsterdam. Turkey offered an asylum for the hunted refugees who were\r\nfortunate enough to cross the boundary, but only very few succeeded,\r\nwhile thousands of those who tried to escape were murdered, or\r\nlanguished in the galleys and prisons as hostages. Manasseh, himself\r\nthe son of a refugee and a martyr, felt this tragedy. On the other\r\nhand, the news concerning the Inquisition in the country of his birth\r\nwas still horrifying the world, for Jews were still being burnt alive\r\nthere. Putting together the brief note in the _Nishmath Chayyim_\r\nregarding the massacres of 1648 with the remarks in _De Termino Vitae_\r\non the Inquisition, we obtain a terrible picture. In _De Termino_\r\nManasseh alludes to the emigration of the _Marranos_.\r\n\r\nThe _Marranos_! What a splendid record of noble deeds, of spontaneous,\r\ngentle piety, of triumphant suffering, is called to memory at the\r\nmere mention of the word! What powerful endurance is described in\r\nthe history of these Jewish martyrs! What an inspiration to attempt\r\neven the impossible in the cause of liberty of conscience! What\r\na great tragedy theirs was――a tragedy illumined by personal deeds\r\nof self-sacrifice! Their story is a story of thrilling personal\r\nexperiences and of sorrow and separation and death.¹\r\n\r\n    ¹ H. H. R. Jacob _de_ Aaron Sasportas gives in his _Ohel Jacob_\r\n      (Amsterdam, 1737) a most eloquent and stirring description\r\n      of the tragedy of the Marranos (_Respon._ III.).\r\n\r\n            They flock, says\r\nManasseh, in thousands to other countries, and it is useless to\r\nattempt to tell in a few words the incalculable loss that Spain and\r\nPortugal have sustained in losing wealth, and inhabitants, by the\r\ninhuman acts of the Inquisition. Apart from their execrable inhumanity,\r\nthe utter folly of the atrocities is apparent from the fact that the\r\nInquisition forces the wealth, trade and skill of the country to leave\r\nit. Here he speaks as a statesman who knows the countries in question.\r\nIn _Nishmath Chayyim_ the note is one of sober-minded resignation. He\r\ndoes not inveigh against the Cossacks as he did against the Portuguese;\r\nhe simply expresses the hope that Carcassone may raise the necessary\r\nfunds, and that God may send His angel before him. By using this\r\nBiblical phrase¹ Manasseh expresses his high appreciation of the\r\nimportance of the mission. The general situation of the Jews in the\r\nDiaspora is described by him in short but plain terms: “If the nations\r\nwould ask, Why are you in captivity, exposed to outrage and contempt,\r\ndispersed and scattered...?” Manasseh clearly rejected the idea that\r\nIsrael’s mission demands an everlasting dispersion. It seemed to him\r\nthat the dispersion ought to be made complete, because it must lead to\r\nthe Restoration. In this respect his views were not only in accordance\r\nwith Scripture, but the outcome of a train of reasoning. The process\r\nof dispersion has to reach its climax, and then the process of\r\nrestoration will begin. The _Hagadic_ sentence:――\r\n\r\n  ²צדקה עשה הקדוש ברוך הוא בישראל שפזרן לבין האומות. פסחים, פז׃\r\n\r\noften quoted by the adherents of the dispersion in support of the\r\n_Galuth_, was interpreted by Manasseh to mean that so long as the\r\nIsraelites must live dispersed they should live dispersed among\r\nseveral nations, because in this way their complete destruction is\r\nmore difficult than if they were dependent upon one or two nations.\r\nBut dispersion is not for him the ideal state of the Jewish nation.\r\n\r\n    ¹ “...He will send His Angel before thee,...”\r\n                                        (Genesis xxiv. 7).\r\n\r\n    ² “The Holy One Blessed be He did justice with Israel by\r\n      scattering them among the nations” (_Pesachim_, _fol._ 87).\r\n\r\n      [The only sentence of this kind, against innumerable others\r\n      in the opposite sense.]\r\n\r\nThe law of Divine providence with regard to the nation of _Israel_ has\r\never been that defection is eventually to be followed by dispersion\r\nand reconciliation by restoration.\r\n\r\n   “Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land\r\n      they defiled it....”                (Ezekiel xxxvi. 17).\r\n\r\n   “... and I scattered them among the nations, and they were\r\n      dispersed through the countries;...” (_Ibid._ 19).\r\n\r\n   “... from all your uncleannesses, and from all your idols,\r\n      will I cleanse you” (_Ibid._ 25).\r\n\r\n   “And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers;\r\n      and ye shall be My people, and I will be your God”\r\n                                            (_Ibid._ 28).\r\n\r\nThere is not one passage in which the promised restoration is\r\nrepresented as anything other than a distinct proof of reconciliation\r\nbetween God and his ancient People, or dispersion as anything other\r\nthan a punishment. The People and the Land of _Israel_ are so linked\r\nwith one another that whatever continuity is ascribed to the one must,\r\non all strict principles of interpretation, be also attributed to\r\nthe other. In the twenty-sixth chapter of _Leviticus_ we find _Moses_\r\ngiving the people, as warning and encouragement, a prophetic outline\r\nof their future history, which forms the real basis, and, in fact,\r\nmakes up the substance of all that is found in the later prophets as\r\nregards the people of _Israel_. It is true that both the judgments\r\nthere threatened and the mercies there promised are set forth\r\nhypothetically, on the supposition of their wickedly departing from\r\nthe Lord and afterwards repenting――“_if ye walk contrary unto Me, and\r\nwill not hearken unto Me_,” on the one hand; “_if they shall confess\r\ntheir iniquity_” on the other. But since the conditional statements\r\nare changed――as they are in other places――into absolute announcements\r\nof what is to take place, the hypothetical forms of expression must be\r\nregarded as merely the appropriate mode of conveying warnings against\r\ndefection and an encouragement to repentance:――\r\n\r\n   “And they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of\r\n      their fathers, ... and also that they have walked contrary\r\n      to Me”                              (Leviticus xxvi. 40).\r\n\r\n   “I also will walk contrary unto them, and bring them into\r\n      the land of their enemies; ... and they shall then be paid\r\n      the punishment of their iniquity”           (_Ibid._ 41).\r\n\r\n   “then will I remember My covenant with Jacob, and also My\r\n      covenant with Isaac, and also My covenant with Abraham will\r\n      I remember; and I will remember the land”   (_Ibid._ 42).\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to deny that the “remembrance of the covenant” and\r\nthe “remembrance of the land” here go together. If we allegorize the\r\none, we must allegorize the other as well, and then there is neither\r\nland, people, covenant, prophets nor law――an obvious absurdity which\r\nat once refutes itself. The fundamental Mosaic principle is clear,\r\nplain and positive. The land is to be held in perpetuity by the\r\nJewish nation, provided the conditions of the covenant are fulfilled.\r\nThe infringement of the covenant subjects the rebel to bondage and\r\nmakes him an outcast from the land of his inheritance. The promise of\r\nredemption is a rescue from the penalties thus incurred. Therefore,\r\nhe explains, the _Agadist_ did not say _heglom_, “He drove them out,”\r\nwhich is the usual expression, but _pizrom_, “He spread, scattered\r\nthem,” because, so long as the _Galuth_ lasts, they have to live\r\nin various countries. Yet it is absurd to think that the state of\r\n_Galuth_, predicted by _Moses_ as a curse, is a blessing. Here we have\r\nin short Manasseh’s ideas as to the _Galuth_ and Restoration. We know\r\nthat he also acted in full accord with these ideas.¹\r\n\r\n    ¹ The British Museum has a copy of the _Nishmath Chayyim_,\r\n      Amsterdam, 1651, with autograph annotations of _R._ Jacob\r\n      Emden [Jacob Israel] (1697‒1776) _ben_ Zebi Hirsch Ashkenazi\r\n      (1658‒1718). Two of these annotations are of special\r\n      interest. Manasseh writes (_fol. 6b_) about the physical\r\n      weakness of the Jews when compared with Gentiles. On this\r\n      Emden remarks: I admit this only with regard to the Jews\r\n      in the _Galuth_; when the Jews lived in their own land they\r\n      amazed the Romans by their great heroes and athletes, and\r\n      more so at the time of the First Temple. In another passage\r\n      (_fol. 8a_), where Manasseh writes about the shorter life\r\n      of those who keep the Law as compared with others, Emden\r\n      again remarks: But in Palestine the Jews distinguished\r\n      themselves by much greater longevity. (M. Seligsohn, the\r\n      author of Emden’s biography in the _Jewish Encyclopedia_,\r\n      who enumerates various books with Emden’s autograph\r\n      annotations, does not seem to have had any knowledge of\r\n      these annotations.)\r\n\r\nThe constitution established by _Moses_ was a theocracy. The true King\r\nof _Israel_ was God, and the constitution was the Law. The priests\r\nand Levites were God’s ministers; the prophets were God’s ambassadors,\r\ncommissioned to convey his instructions not only to the people but to\r\nthe King himself. The Kingdom was thus emphatically the Kingdom of God,\r\nand the King was the earthly viceroy of the invisible Sovereign. He\r\nwas more limited than a constitutional monarch; he was subject not\r\nonly to the Law, but also to those who were entitled to explain the\r\nLaw. Such a state of things never existed in any other nation, either\r\nin ancient or in modern times. The Jewish nation regards it as an\r\nIdeal State, and looks forward to a future in which this idea will\r\nbe accepted by the whole world, when God will be the King; but this\r\nwill take place only after the establishment of this Divine order in\r\nPalestine. Therefore Jews pray to God to give them their judges and\r\ntheir counsellors as in ancient times, _i.e._ to restore their life\r\nunder God’s order, a life of justice and peace and wisdom; they hope\r\nalso that this will influence all mankind to recognize the Kingdom of\r\nGod, _i.e._ the rule of justice, mercy and love. Then the promise to\r\n_Abraham_ will be fulfilled:――\r\n\r\n   “... and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be\r\n      blessed;...”                          (Genesis xxii. 18).\r\n\r\nand the blessings and privileges of God’s Kingdom will be offered\r\nfreely to all mankind. Here the influence of Abrabanel is evident.¹\r\nAnother interesting point in Manasseh’s theory is his combination of\r\nthe idea of the _Nefesh Ha’yisraelith_ with the principle of heredity.\r\nHe terms this principle _Mizgé² Ha’aboth_, that is, the particular\r\ncharacter of the nationality inherited from the ancestors. This is\r\nJewish nationality, which is part of the Jew’s inheritance at birth.³\r\n\r\n    ¹ Abrabanel’s commentary on 1 Samuel viii.\r\n\r\n    ² In Biblical _Hebrew_ “_Mezeg_” means blended, or mingled\r\n      [“_Al Yechsar Hamazeg_” (_Cant._ vii. 3)]: in mediæval\r\n      _Hebrew_ it signifies “Character,” “Individual Nature,”\r\n      “Temperament.”\r\n\r\n    ³ It is worthy of notice that some Christian theologians have\r\n      come――from another point of view――to the same conclusion as\r\n      to the importance of the Jewish race:\r\n\r\n      “The question of their National Restoration is one of\r\n      blood and not of creed, of race and not of conversion, of\r\n      nationality which might include as many sects as in the days\r\n      of Christ. One only question can be demanded by the hallowed\r\n      soil of that country, and by the Providence of God――_Are\r\n      you a Jew?_ In this sense the twelve Apostles were Jews,\r\n      and if now on earth their title to their land is as clear,\r\n      undoubted, and equitable as that of Nehemiah or any modern\r\n      Jew. The Christian creed does not make any of that nation\r\n      less a Jew and a descendant of Abraham.... The question of\r\n      Jewish nationality, and consequently of restoration, is not\r\n      one of creed but of race, and as such it should be kept\r\n      before the mind. The isolation of the Jew would be as great,\r\n      if all were Christians, as at present. His separation from\r\n      amongst the nations has been pronounced by that omnipotent\r\n      word, whose truth and will in effecting its purposes are\r\n      only equalled by the unalterable character of the Divine\r\n      nature. They shall dwell alone. They are not amalgamated\r\n      with the nations. In their final return, a peculiarity of\r\n      religious rites and laws will keep them apart from other\r\n      people. Once a Jew, he is always a Jew, whatever may be\r\n      his creed” (Rev. A. G. H. Hollingsworth, Remarks, _etc._,\r\n      London, 1852, _p._ 21).\r\n\r\nThis is more than the religious idea of the _Z’chuth Aboth_ (Merits of\r\nthe Fathers); it is, though mixed up with _Cabbalistic_ notions, an\r\nethnological conception――the real basis of the modern Jewish national\r\nidea.\r\n\r\nManasseh’s conception of the character (or particular blood mingling)\r\nof ancestors, which lives on in the nation, accords entirely with\r\nthe mode of thought of a modern national Jew as this finds expression\r\nin the best writings of the new Zionistic literature. When the Jew\r\nfeels the pulse-beat of nature in his heart, then the history of his\r\nforefathers comes to life within him. He no longer struggles alone\r\nthrough life, he is sensible of connections between himself and\r\nmillions who have been and of whose spirit and soul he has received\r\na share in life. The most glorious, invigorating feeling which an old\r\nrace can offer; the consciousness of individual transitoriness and\r\nuniversal constancy, begins only then to be of value for him because\r\nthe easily intelligible national future has made comprehensible his\r\nown infinite one. This psychic process is the unconscious aim of\r\nthat which he perceives as national longing. The free individual\r\nmust become a problematic nature if he cannot force the roots of his\r\nspiritual and physical personality into the soil of a soul-related\r\ncommunity. The unit goes adrift in the chaos of social struggles when\r\nit is not linked by a thousand tender and yet untearable threads with\r\nthe ethnical community of a nation. This ethnical community is the\r\nfount of two infinite perceptions which have become the mightiest\r\nsupports of human civilization; first of all arises the consciousness\r\nof national control which develops into the unnoticed, yea,\r\nself-evident foundation of the ethnical unit, the moral consciousness\r\nof duty and sense of responsibility. National responsibility finds\r\nits complement in the right of recovery of the individual against\r\nthe community. In the wrestle with other morals and conceptions of\r\nlife, the individual has often to lean on those who are like-minded\r\nbecause like-born so as not to lose himself. It has been repeatedly\r\nexperienced in Jewish history that many Jews have not only lost\r\ntheir veriest substance but have voluntarily surrendered it, so that\r\ntheir culture subsisted only through an ingenious system of exquisite\r\nimitations of foreign nature and foreign customs.\r\n\r\nWhat Manasseh understood under “Character of Ancestors” pertains\r\nas little to atavism as the modern Jewish national idea. Atavism is\r\nsomething unconscious, it is found even among the dejudaized Jews.\r\nBut what with the dejudaized is atavism becomes with nationalist Jews\r\nthe historic basis of their whole life tendency. The comprehension\r\nof the past wafts the first breath of life into the present, upon the\r\nwreckage of bygone times dawns the premonition of the greatness of\r\neach lived moment――and new life blossoms upon the ruins. Therein lies\r\nalso the power of the national consciousness to create cultural values.\r\nWhat is based upon heredity and tradition is no longer sacrificed\r\nto thoughtless recession of self――misconstrued as civilization――but\r\nreplenished with national love. It is no longer the anarchy of aimless\r\n“culture” which wants to link up with the attainments of unfamiliar\r\nraces so as to become like them, and which as an imitation it can\r\nnever attain, but it is a strongly rooted culture, which reaches deep\r\ndown to the national wells of life, and can thereby become equal to\r\nall other great and deep-rooted cultures.\r\n\r\nThe individual is the outcome of a nation, its ultimate aim. The\r\nnation is the circuitous way of nature to produce an individual. A\r\nnation is great, not only when great creative minds arise from its\r\nmidst, but also when the many live intensively, so that they receive\r\nimpulses from the few, and return impulses to the few――and when the\r\npast lives on in the present. It is this idea of Jewish nationality\r\nwhich Manasseh had forefelt in spite of his mysticism. He was\r\npermeated with religious enthusiasm and, at the same time, all\r\naglow with intense national feeling. Therefore, his thoughts and\r\nsentiments tended to greatness; he understood that the best means of\r\nstrengthening and reaffirming the national consciousness of a people\r\nabout to lose the knowledge of its ethnical individuality, is just\r\nthat it should be told its history, that its ancestors should be\r\nrecalled to memory, their great deeds sung and praised, and that pride\r\nof the past should be instilled. As he poetised so sublimely he could\r\nalso accomplish great deeds, because he kept his eye upon Palestine\r\nhe was also able to achieve great results in the Diaspora. He was\r\nthe father of post-exilic English Judaism, and this Judaism ought to\r\nfollow in his footsteps.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, reference should be made to the _Hebrew_ writer Perez\r\nSmolenskin, himself a pioneer of modern Zionism, who, though he did\r\nnot deal with the matter in detail, was guided by a sound intuition\r\nwhen he characterized Manasseh in his _Am Olam_ (1880) as a great\r\npioneer of the national idea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n                      MANASSEH’S CONTEMPORARIES\r\n\r\n    The Renaissance and the Reformation――John Sadler――Milton’s\r\n    belief in the Return――Edmund Bunny――Isaac _de_ La Peyrère\r\n    ――Leibnitz――Thomas Brightman――James Durham――The pamphlet\r\n    “Doomes-Day”――Thomas Burnet――The pamphlet “The New _Jerusalem_”\r\n    ――Thomas Drake――Edward Nicholas, John Sadler, Hugh Peters,\r\n    Henry Jesse, Isaac Vossius, Hugo Grotius, Rembrandt, Isaac\r\n    _da_ Fonseca Aboab, Dr. Ephraim Hezekiah Bueno, Dr. Abraham\r\n    Zacuto Lusitano, _H.

A great stir\r\nwas caused among Jews as well as Christians by Montezinos’ report and\r\nother rumours concerning the lost Ten Tribes. John Sadler (1615‒1674)\r\n(Appendix xii), Town Clerk of London, a friend of Cromwell, and\r\nprobably also of Milton and Dury, stated that there was an old\r\nprophecy which fixed the time of the Restoration at the year 5408 =\r\n1648 A.D. Puritans and Sectarians began to take the greatest interest\r\nin Jewish Messianic affairs just before King Charles I. (1600‒1649)\r\nwas executed, for most of them were looking forward to some new\r\nreformed Commonwealth, some new communion of saints, some republic,\r\nsome peaceful kingdom of Truth and Justice, and they connected the\r\nrestoration of _Israel_ scripturally with its advent. That was one\r\nreason why Sadler and Cromwell and others were favourably disposed\r\ntowards the Jews and inclined to let them come back to England, for\r\nthe idea prevailed that the Jews had first to be dispersed throughout\r\nthe whole world before the Lord would return to set up His millennial\r\nKingdom. Milton thought that the whole twelve tribes would return to\r\n_Zion_;¹ and similar sympathetic views are expressed in an anonymous\r\nromance published in London in 1648, entitled _Nova Solyma_ (Appendix\r\nxiii), of which it has been claimed he was the author.\r\n\r\n    ¹ Paradise | Regain’d. | A | Poem. | In iv.

He\r\nexpects France to carry out this idea, and appeals in this sense to\r\nthe Royal Dynasty in a somewhat strange homiletical manner.³ In 1644\r\nhe was appointed French Ambassador at Copenhagen. Being on intimate\r\nterms with the eminent scholars Isaac [Vos] Vossius (Appendix xv)\r\n(1618‒1689) and Hugo Grotius [Huig _van_ Groot]⁴ (1583‒1645) he became\r\nacquainted with their mutual friend Manasseh and with Manasseh’s\r\nfriends, Caspar [_van_ Baerle] Barlaeus (1584‒1648), Simon Episcopius\r\n(1583‒1643), Gerard John [Vos] Vossius (1577‒1649),⁵ Johannes [_van_\r\nMeurs] Meursius (1579‒1639), David Blondel (1591‒1655), [Peter]\r\nPetrus [Serrurier] Serrarius (_fl._ 1650‒1700) and Paulus Felgenhauer\r\n(_circa_ 1625), who all supported similar ideas.\r\n\r\n    ¹ “... the curious will be rather surprised to learn that the\r\n      Abbe [Henri] Grégoire (1750‒1831) and others have been under\r\n      a mistake in asserting that Peyreyra’s _Rappel des Juifs_\r\n      was printed during his life-time, upwards of 120 years: for\r\n      this singular book, as it appears from the learned Jesuit,\r\n      his friend, he could never obtain a license; but the fair\r\n      copy, which he deposited in a public library, only appeared\r\n      in print in Paris, after it became the pleasure of the head\r\n      of the French government to assemble a Jewish _Sanhedrin_ in\r\n      May, 1806, for reasons that are obvious....”\r\n\r\n                          (_Gentleman’s Magazine_, vol. lxxxii.,\r\n                                      November, 1812, _p._ 432.)\r\n\r\n    ² _p._ 373: ADVIS AV LECTEVR. _Ce petit Traittè n’est qu’vn\r\n      Essay et un Extraict d’un plus grand Desseing que i’ay\r\n      conceu; intitulé_ SYNOPSIS DOCTRINÆ CHRISTIANÆ AD VSVM\r\n      IVDÆORVM ET GENTIVM.\r\n\r\n    ³ “Ie fonde cette Cõiecture sur ce que cette grãde Deliurance\r\n      des Iuifs fut traittée & concluë dãs la ville Royale de\r\n      Susan: Svsan, qui signifie Le Lys.

(1638‒1715)\r\n      about the conquest of Egypt. “Epistola ad regem Franciæ\r\n      de expeditione Egyptiaca.” This interesting appeal, which\r\n      contains also some references to _Jerusalem_ and Syria, was\r\n      discovered in Hanover during the first occupation by the\r\n      French and transmitted to the First Consul Bonaparte, who\r\n      wrote from Namur on the 4th August, 1803: “Mortier m’envoie\r\n      à l’instant même un manuscrit, en latin, de Leibnitz,\r\n      adressé à Louis XIV., pour lui proposer la conquête de\r\n      l’Egypte.

The most notable of his Jewish friends were,\r\nIsaac _da_ Fonseca Aboab (1605‒1693) (Appendix xx), _Haham_ of the\r\n_Sephardi_ community at Amsterdam, on whose initiative the Great\r\nSynagogue there was erected. Dr. Ephraim Hezekiah (_ob._ 1665) [_de_\r\nDr. Joseph⁴ (_ob._ 1641)] Bueno (Bonus), author of several liturgical\r\nworks⁵ and the subject of Rembrandt’s famous etching “The Jew Doctor”;\r\nDr. Abraham Zacuto Lusitano (1580‒1642) (Appendix xxi), one of the\r\nmost celebrated physicians of his age; Jacob Jehudah Aryeh _de_ Leon\r\n[Templo] (1603‒1675), chiefly known as having designed models of the\r\nTabernacle and Temple and was called “Templo” for that reason, which\r\nwas assumed as a surname by his descendants. In anticipation of his\r\nvisit to England, to exhibit the models before Charles II. (1630‒1685)\r\nand his Court, he published in Amsterdam a pamphlet in English\r\ndescribing them (Appendix xxii): and _H. H. R._ Yahacob Sasportas\r\n(1610‒1698), who accompanied Manasseh to England in 1655, was\r\nappointed in the month of _Nisan_, 1664, _Haham_ of the _Sephardi_\r\ncommunity in London. He was the author of one of the treatises in\r\n_Sepher Pene Rabah_ edited by Manasseh Ben Israel ... Amsterdam 5388,\r\nand also wrote _Sepher Ohel Ya’acob_ and _Sepher Kizur Zizath Nobel\r\nZebi_, which were published together at Amsterdam 5497, against\r\nthe adherents of _Sabbatai Zebi_ (1626‒1676). His stay here was of\r\nshort duration――not quite two years. He left the country to escape\r\nthe plague which was then raging, and subsequently, in 1681, became\r\nthe Ecclesiastical Head of the _Sephardi_ Jews in Amsterdam. It is\r\nnoteworthy that two of these friends of Manasseh, Aboab and Sasportas,\r\nwere particularly interested in the Messianic hopes, though from\r\ndifferent points of view. Aboab, a _Cabbalist_, whose religious\r\npoetry is remarkable for chaste diction and wealth of imagination, was\r\nsupposed to be a secret _Sabbatian_, while Sasportas, sober-minded and\r\na strict _Talmudist_, was strongly opposed to the mystical tendencies\r\nof pseudo-Messianism, and hoped for the restoration in the traditional\r\nway.\r\n\r\n    ¹ Two of these letters have been published by _Heer_ J.

He had been a victim of the Inquisition,\r\nwhich deprived him of his wealth, and on three distinct occasions had\r\nbeen subjected to excruciating tortures, which undermined his health.\r\nThey apparently fled to La Rochelle, France, for it was here that\r\nManasseh was shortly afterwards born, in 1604, as is attested by\r\nhis marriage certificate, deposited in the Archives of the City of\r\nAmsterdam (Puiboek, No. 669, _fo._ 95 _verso_, 15 Aug. 1623). Here\r\nhe was also baptized, as it was not until his parents arrived at\r\nAmsterdam that they dared avow their faith in the God of _Israel_. In\r\na holograph letter¹ of Manasseh to an unknown correspondent (suggested\r\nby Mr. E. N.

Most of his connections were\r\nwith Spanish and Portuguese Jews, though he was opposed to any sort\r\nof separation, condemning it in his writings, and emphasizing the\r\nnecessity of Jewish unity and brotherhood. It is noteworthy that\r\na hundred and twenty-six years later, when the father of Jewish\r\nRationalism, Moses Mendelssohn (1729‒1786), had to defend Judaism\r\nand the Jewish people, he found no better apology than Manasseh’s\r\n_Vindiciae Judæorum_ (1656), which was translated into German, and\r\nfor which he wrote the admirable _Vorrede_ (Appendix xxiv).\r\n\r\n    ¹                         AMSTERDAM, ultimo de Janʳᵒ, 1648.\r\n      Magᵉᵒ y muy docto Sʳ\r\n\r\n      _... y el Thesoro de los dinim de nuestros ritos y\r\n      ceremonias, este en mi lengua materna lusitana_, porq’ yo\r\n      _soy por patria Lixbonense_....

It purports to be a translation\r\nfrom the Italian of a letter dated 1 June, 1606, sent by _Signior_\r\nValesco to _Don_ Mathias _de_ Rensie of Venice. In it he is informed\r\nof the perturbed state of the world, and that Hungary, Bohemia and\r\nMuscovia are to declare war, seize Constantinople, and drive the\r\nTurk out of Europe. Tunis, Morocco, with the Arabians, and others,\r\nare to expel the Turk entirely out of Africa. The Soffie, the Medes,\r\nthe people of Melibar on the border of India are in revolt. The\r\nmost alarming news is to the effect than an unknown people, strong,\r\nmighty and swift, from beyond the Caspian mountains, claiming to be\r\ndescendants of the lost Ten Tribes, are coming to recover the Land of\r\nPromise from the Turk. This is followed by a detailed account of the\r\nleaders of each tribe, the strength of each army, with the particulars\r\nof its equipment. The letter concludes by a promise of more news in a\r\nfew days.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, a Puritan England that welcomed back the Jews as an\r\nancient nation and as the “People of the Book.” In 1621 the Rev. Dr.\r\nWilliam Gouge (1578‒1653) published the anonymous work:――\r\n\r\n    _The World’s Great Restauration. Or, The Calling of the Iewes_\r\n                                                  (Appendix xxvi).\r\n\r\nIn the preliminary leaf, “To the Reader,” signed “Thine in the Lord,\r\nWilliam Gouge. Church-Court in Black-fryers, London 8. Ianuary. 1621.”\r\nhe states:――\r\n\r\n    “_... I haue bin moued to publish this Treatise ... and to\r\n    commend it to thy reading. And this is all that I haue done.\r\n    The worke it selfe is the worke of one who hath dived deeper\r\n    into that mysterie then I can doe.

Neither Wood’s\r\n      _Athenæ_, Bohn’s _Lowndes_, _The Dictionary of National\r\n      Biography_, nor The British Museum catalogue mention them.\r\n\r\nThe writer, Sir Henry Finch (1558‒1625), Serjeant-at-Law (1616), was\r\na distinguished author of many legal works. Mr. J. M. Rigg, in the\r\n_Dictionary of National Biography_, vol. xix., 1889, tells us, that\r\nin this treatise “he seems to have predicted in the near future the\r\nrestoration of temporal dominion to the Jews and the establishment\r\nby them of a world-wide empire.” This caused James I. to treat the\r\nwork as a libel, and accordingly Finch was arrested in April, 1621.\r\nHe obtained his liberty by disavowing all such portions of the work as\r\nmight be construed as derogatory to the sovereign and by apologizing\r\nfor having written unadvisedly. William Laud (1573‒1645), Bishop of\r\nSt. David’s, 1621,¹ in a sermon preached in July of that year, took\r\noccasion to animadvert on the book. It was suppressed, and is now\r\nextremely rare.\r\n\r\n    ¹ Bishop of Bath and Wells, 1626; Bishop of London, 1628;\r\n      Archbishop of Canterbury, 1633.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the official proceedings, in consequence of which he was\r\nforced to sign his recantation and acknowledge his loyalty to the\r\nsovereign, Finch clearly never renounced the principal idea of his\r\nbook. A letter from the pen of a celebrity of the day gives a fair\r\nidea not only of the sensation which Finch’s _Apocryphal Apocalypse_\r\ncreated at the time, but also of the personal and somewhat strange\r\nmotives underlying King James’s indignation (Appendix xxvii).\r\n\r\nDr. Gouge was considered equally culpable. He was imprisoned for\r\nnine weeks, and only released on giving certain explanations, which\r\n[George Abbot (1562‒1633)] the Archbishop of Canterbury (1611) deemed\r\nsatisfactory. He was a fellow of King’s College, Cambridge, where\r\nhe taught _Hebrew_, having been the only steadfast pupil of a Jew\r\n(Appendix xxviii) who came to Cambridge to give instruction in that\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nRoger Williams (1604(5)‒1683), the son of James (_ob._ 1621) and Alice\r\nWilliams, was a native of London. He was one of the great pioneers of\r\nReligious liberty, his prime contention being that the civil powers\r\nshould have no authority over the consciences of men. Ecclesiastical\r\ntyranny induced him to emigrate in 1631 to America. In 1635 he\r\nwas banished from the state of Massachusetts for his heretical and\r\npolitical opinions. The following year he and a few other malcontents,\r\nafter many hardships and trials arrived at Rhode Island, and in\r\ngratitude to God’s mercy he named the first settlement “Providence.”\r\nIn 1638 he purchased land from the aborigines, and the state of Rhode\r\nIsland was founded. In June, 1643, he set sail for his native land to\r\nobtain a charter, which was granted, dated 14 March, 1644, giving the\r\n“Providence Plantations” full power to rule themselves by any form of\r\ngovernment they preferred. During his stay here of but a few months,\r\nhe published two tracts advocating religious and political freedom.\r\nIn one he writes: “For who knowes not but many ... of the ... Jewish\r\nReligion, may be clear and free from _scandalous offences_ in their\r\nlife, and also from _disobedience_ to the Civill Lawes of a State?”¹\r\n\r\n    ¹ The | Blovdy tenent, | of Persecution, for cause of |\r\n      Conscience, discussed, in | A Conference _betweene_ | Trvth\r\n      and Peace. | Who, In all tender Affection, present to the\r\n      High | Court of _Parliament_, (as the _Result_ of | their\r\n      _Discourse_) these, (amongst other | Passages) of _highest\r\n      consideration_. | Printed in the Year 1644.

The author arrived at\r\nBoston on the seventeenth of December following. In 1651 he again\r\nembarked for England, in connection with matters concerning the State\r\nhe had founded and remained for two and a half years.\r\n\r\nEcclesiastical affairs here were in an unsettled condition, so a\r\n“Parliamentary Committee,” known as “The Committee for the Propagation\r\nof the Gospel,” was formed, of which Cromwell himself was a member,\r\nto consider certain proposals of some twenty leading divines. Among\r\nthe papers, one presented by Major Butler and others, contained the\r\nfollowing clause:――\r\n\r\n    4. “Whether it be not the duty of the Magistrates to permit\r\n        the Jews, ... to live freely and peaceably among us.”\r\n\r\nThis was accompanied by a comment, signed R.W.,¹ in which he argues at\r\nlength under seven different heads why “this wrong”――their exclusion\r\nshould not be continued:――\r\n\r\n    ¹ Roger Williams.\r\n\r\n    “I humbly conceive it to be the _Duty_ of the _Civil\r\n    Magistrate_ to break down that superstitious _wall_ of\r\n    _separation_ (as to Civil things) between us Gentiles and the\r\n    Jews, and freely (without this asking) to make way for their\r\n    free and peaceable Habitation amongst us.”\r\n\r\n    “As other _Nations_, so this especially, and the _Kings_\r\n    thereof have had just cause to fear, that the _unchristian\r\n    oppressions_, _incivilities_ and _inhumanities_ of this Nation\r\n    against the Jews have cried to Heaven against this _Nation_\r\n    and the _Kings_ and _Princes_ of it.”\r\n\r\n    “What horrible _oppressions_ and horrible _slaughters_\r\n    have the _Jews_ suffered from the _Kings_ and peoples of\r\n    this Nation, in the Reigns of _Henry 2_ (1133‒1189), K.\r\n    _John_ (1167‒1216), Richard I.

He held office until\r\nMay, 1658, and it is worthy of note that one who took a significant\r\npart in securing the admission of Jews to England in the Old World,\r\nwas the founder of a state in New England in the New World, which\r\nwas the first to grant equal rights to Jews at a time when he was its\r\nPresident. He died at Providence in the early part of April, 1683.¹\r\n\r\n    ¹ Roger Williams, The Pioneer of Religious Liberty. By Oscar\r\n      S. Straus....

He took a lively interest in the disputes which arose between\r\npartisans of the new Puritan movement and those who adhered to the old\r\ndoctrines, besides dwelling on the question of religious liberty, and\r\nhe argued that so long as the Jews were not equal in their rights to\r\nothers as a nation, “the heart will be filled with violence.”\r\n\r\nJohn Dury (Durie), the ubiquitous Protestant divine, who travelled\r\nmuch and endeavoured to bring together all sections of Protestantism,\r\nwas a great friend of the Jews. He was one of those who drew up the\r\n“Westminster Confession” and “Catechisms.” In 1649‒50 he wrote _An\r\nEpistolicall Discourse of Mr. Iohn Dury, to Mr. Thorowgood, concerning\r\nhis conjecture that the Americans are descended from the Israelites_\r\n(Appendix xxxi), and during his stay at Cassel, in Germany, _A Case\r\nof Conscience, Whether it be lawful to admit Jews into a Christian\r\nCommonwealth?_ (Appendix xxxii).¹\r\n\r\n    ¹ The Rev. Walter Begley, in his issue of _Nova Solyma_, 1902,\r\n      vol. i. p. 350, refers to the _Commonwealth of Israel_,\r\n      1650, as one of Dury’s works. The catalogues of the British\r\n      Museum and the Bodleian Libraries do not record a copy.\r\n      The _D.N.B._ does not include it in its list of his works,\r\n      but mentions 20. _Epistolary Discourse [on Israelitish\r\n      origin]_, 1649, and 27. _Epistolary Discourse [on Americans\r\n      being Israelites]_, 1650, both equally unknown. The latter,\r\n      however, may be “An Epistolicall Discourse Of Mr. Iohn Dury\r\n      ... that the Americans are descended from the Israelites,”\r\n      printed in the preliminary leaves of _Iewes in America ...\r\n      Tho: Thorowgood_ ... 1650.\r\n\r\nAnother great friend of the Jews was Henry Jessey, or Jacie\r\n(1601‒1663), a Baptist divine. He began his studies in 1618 at\r\nCambridge, where at St. John’s College in ♦1622 he was admitted\r\nConstable’s scholar. _Hebrew_ and _Rabbinical_ literatures were his\r\nfavourite studies. He projected a revised translation of the Bible\r\nand made some progress in it. He collected £300 for the poor Jews\r\nof _Jerusalem_, who in consequence of the war between the Swedes and\r\nPoles in 1657 were reduced to great extremity, as the main source\r\nof income derived from their charitable coreligionists in European\r\ncountries was thereby cut off. This is, as far as is known, the\r\nearliest instance of English Christians helping the Jews of Palestine\r\n(Appendix xxxiii).\r\n\r\n    ♦ “1662” replaced with “1622”\r\n\r\nIn 1653 he wrote a treatise for the purpose of reconciling the various\r\nreligious opinions of Jews and Gentiles, entitled, _The Glory of\r\nJehudah and Israel_ (Appendix xxxiv).\r\n\r\nHis liberality to Jews was memorable on other occasions. He claimed\r\nfor them the rights of citizenship and admission to this country which\r\nwas then under consideration.\r\n\r\nHe was one of the members of the Assembly convened by Cromwell\r\nto consider Manasseh Ben Israel’s proposals for the return of his\r\ncoreligionists to England. He is supposed to be the author of an\r\nanonymous tract, entitled _A Narrative of the late Proceeds at\r\nWhite-Hall, concerning the Jews_ (Appendix xxxv).\r\n\r\nThomas Fuller (1608‒1661),¹ Prebendary of Salisbury, delivered several\r\nsermons, in which he argued that the Jewish nation was fulfilling an\r\nimportant office in the world and was, under the order of Providence,\r\nan instrument in giving the victory to good over evil. This nation\r\nought not, therefore, to content itself with mere existence, but\r\nshould throw its elements, or the best of them, into another mould and\r\nconstitute out of them a new society which would become a blessing to\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n    ¹ Author of “A Pisgah-Sight of Palestine” ...

Dr._ WILLIAM GOUGE\r\n\r\n                 HUGO GROTIUS          _Rev._ HENRY JESSEY\r\n\r\nAll these Christian pioneers of religious liberty and Zionism were in\r\nclose connection with Manasseh, and helped him to prepare the way for\r\nthe re-admission of the Jews into England.\r\n\r\nThe view held by many Christians, especially in England, was that\r\nthe Israelitish race, now scattered over the face of the earth, would\r\neventually be brought back to its own land. To this was generally\r\nadded the belief that the Jews would return in a converted, _i.e._\r\nChristian, state.¹ In conformity with the general spirit of the period,\r\nall these ideas had a religious colouring in the minds both of English\r\ntheologians and writers and of the Jews themselves.\r\n\r\n    ¹ The final ingathering of the Jews is taught in both the\r\n      Jewish and Christian Bibles.\r\n\r\nWhy were these considerations particularly important with regard to\r\nEngland? In seeking an answer to this question we are met at once by\r\nthe significant fact dealt with in the first chapter of this book: the\r\nattachment of Englishmen to the Bible.\r\n\r\nThe men and women who live in the pages of the Bible had long ago\r\nbecome recognized types for the English nation. As early as the\r\nseventeenth century interest in the restoration of _Israel_ had become\r\ndeep and general, England providing the earliest stimulus to Zionism.\r\nThe connection between this idea, and the idea of the readmission of\r\nthe Jews into England after long years of exclusion, following their\r\nfinal expulsion under Edward I. in the year 1290, and the steady\r\nprogress of the latter idea, supported and determined by the former,\r\nis characteristic not only of Manasseh’s writings, efforts and plans,\r\nbut of the whole epoch. Facts prove with what steadfastness of aim and\r\nconsistency of thought the problem was attacked and conquered by the\r\nPuritan theologians and writers, and to what an extent their defence\r\nof the Jews formed one comprehensive and consistent scheme, of which\r\nthe readmission of the Jews (justice applied to _individuals_) was one\r\npart, and the Restoration of _Israel_ (justice applied to _the nation\r\nas a whole_) was another.\r\n\r\nWhoever studies Manasseh’s writings and the Puritan literature of that\r\nepoch will have no difficulty in recognizing that the idea of national\r\njustice to the Jews underlies all the discussions and controversies\r\nand is common to all schools of thought. Thus Zionism has but brought\r\nto light and given practical form and a recognized position to a\r\nprinciple which had long consciously or unconsciously guided English\r\nopinion. The ideas of Readmission and Restoration originally formed\r\na single stream in England, before they separated to flow in distinct\r\nbut parallel channels. Readmission, however, became an immediate\r\npractical result, whilst Restoration was left for the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n                         RESTORATION SCHEMES\r\n\r\n    Dr. John Jortin――Thomas Newton, Bishop of Bristol――Edward King\r\n    ――Samuel Horsley, Bishop of Rochester and St. Asaph――Jewish\r\n    Colonies in South America――Marshal de Saxe’s scheme――Anecdote\r\n    by Margravine of Anspach――Earl of Egmont’s project――Proposed\r\n    settlement of German Jews in Pennsylvania――Viscount\r\n    Kingsborough’s Mexican colony――John Adams, President of the\r\n    United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE books and pamphlets, consisting largely of interpretations of\r\nthe Bible, naturally contain many ideas open to serious criticism on\r\nthe part of a modern reader. Inevitably also (seeing that the writers\r\nwere theologians) they exhibit a persistent tendency to conversionism.\r\nBut one thing that continually impresses one is the earnestness\r\nand sincerity revealed throughout. The readmission of the Jews into\r\nEngland was likewise connected in some quarters with conversionist\r\ntendencies, but on the whole it was an act of justice, and the Jews\r\nprofited by it.\r\n\r\nThe writers with whom we have been dealing were men trained from\r\nchildhood to read the Holy Scriptures, to reflect upon what they read,\r\nand to consider every question from the standpoint of their religious\r\nconvictions. A certain weakness will no doubt be found in the\r\none-sided exegetical tendency shown in the numberless explanations of\r\nthe seventh chapter of the Book of _Daniel_, and various Apocalyptic\r\nprophecies. But have not all the different denominations done the\r\nsame? Has not each one made use of some part of the Bible in order\r\nto support its ideas? Does not every sect explain the word of God\r\naccording to its own way of thinking? Do not the opinions of one sect\r\nconflict with and contradict those of another? It must be remembered\r\nthat this method of Scriptural interpretation was in keeping with\r\nthe spirit of the time, and that the entire question was still in\r\nits infancy. Be that as it may, one cannot but be grateful for the\r\ndevotion of these Christian champions, in spite of the peculiarity of\r\nsome of their notions. Although as Jews we often differ from them as\r\nregards the interpretation and application of certain verses, still\r\nwe cannot withhold our admiration for the sincere enthusiasm which is\r\nevinced in most of their writings.\r\n\r\nDr. John Jortin (1698‒1770), an ecclesiastical historian and critic,\r\nthe author of _The Life of Erasmus_ ... London ... 1758‒1760, and of\r\nmany books dealing with the problem of the Jewish people, developed\r\nthe idea that the preservation of this people, “under such long,\r\nsuch signal and such unexampled persecutions and calamities inclines\r\none to think that they are reserved for some illustrious purpose of\r\nProvidence.”\r\n\r\nThomas Newton (1704‒1782), Bishop of Bristol (1761), a divine of great\r\nauthority, defended the idea of the Restoration of _Israel_ in words\r\nwhich no Jewish national enthusiast could excel. The Jews, he believes,\r\nwill be restored to their native city and country. At the same time,\r\nhe emphasizes the dignity and the necessity of Jewish distinctiveness\r\nall over the world, and condemns anti-Jewish prejudice:――\r\n\r\n    “We see that the great empires, which in their turns subdued\r\n    and oppressed the people of God, are all come to ruin;\r\n    because, tho’ they executed the purposes of God, yet that\r\n    was more than they understood; all that they intended was to\r\n    satiate their own pride and ambition, their own cruelty and\r\n    revenge. And if such hath been the fatal end of the enemies\r\n    and oppressors of the Jews, let it serve as a warning to all\r\n    those, who at any time or upon any occasion are for raising a\r\n    clamor and persecution against them”¹       (Appendix xxxvi).\r\n\r\n    ¹ Dissertations on the Prophecies, ... vol. i. ...

In one of his books,¹\r\nwhich is written with intense faith and enthusiasm, and abounds in\r\nbeautiful passages that appeal to the imagination and heart, the one\r\npoint in which he is particularly emphatic is the return of the Jews\r\nas Jews to the Holy Land.\r\n\r\n    ¹ Remarks on The Signs of the Times; By Edward King, Esq.,\r\n      F.R.S.A.S....

It was the\r\ndeclaration of a man who was, as a contemporary biographer says, “an\r\nornament to the Senate, an honour to the Church of England, and one of\r\nthe first characters of the age in which he lived.”\r\n\r\nIn some tracts written at the beginning of the nineteenth century a\r\nsemi-political note is already sounded, as, for instance, in the tract\r\n_A Call to the Christians and the Hebrews, by Theætetus_ (Appendix\r\nxxxvii). This call did not find an immediate response; nevertheless,\r\nthe political idea of the Restoration of _Israel_ reappeared at\r\nvarious epochs in England as well as in the other English-speaking\r\ncountries and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe various efforts to establish autonomous Jewish Colonies in America\r\nduring the early history of that country are not strictly Zionism, but\r\nare not without interest from the Zionist point of view. “Under the\r\nauthority of the Dutch West India Company.... In 1652, a tract of land\r\n... was granted in the island of Curaçao to Joseph Nunez _da_ Fonseca,\r\nand others, to found a colony of Jews in that island ... but it was\r\nnot successful....”¹\r\n\r\n    ¹ _The Settlement of the Jews in North America._ By Charles P.\r\n      Daly, LL.D. ...

The scheme is\r\nreferred to as “Privileges Granted to the People of the Hebrew Nation\r\nthat are to goe to the Wilde Cust” (_Egerton MSS._, _vol._ 2395,\r\nNo. 8. [B. M.]).\r\n\r\nA grant was made by the French West India Company to David Nasi, a\r\nPortuguese Jew, in 1659, by a charter which authorized him to found a\r\nJewish colony in Cayenne.\r\n\r\nSome of the later projects are even more interesting. About the year\r\n1749 Marshal _de_ Saxe¹ contemplated erecting a Jewish state in South\r\nAmerica of which he would be King. “...

This was John Adams (1735‒1826), the second President\r\nof the United States of America (1797‒1801), and one of the most\r\ndistinguished patriots of the Revolution. He was one of the most\r\nenthusiastic supporters of the Zionist idea. In a letter addressed to\r\nMajor Mordecai Manuel Noah (1785‒1851), he says: “I really wish the\r\nJews again in Judea, an independent nation, for, as I believe, the\r\nmost enlightened men of it have participated in the amelioration of\r\nthe philosophy of the age; once restored to an independent government,\r\nand no longer persecuted, they would soon wear away some of the\r\nasperities and peculiarities of their character,...” But, anticipating\r\nthat he might be wrongly supposed to desire the return of the Jews\r\nto Palestine for the purpose of getting them away from America or\r\nlimiting their rights in that country, he continues: “I wish your\r\nnation may be admitted to all the privileges of citizens in every\r\npart of the world. This country (America) has done much; I wish it\r\nmay do more, and annul every narrow idea in religion, government and\r\ncommerce.”¹\r\n\r\n    ¹ Discourse on The Restoration of the Jews: Delivered at the\r\n      Tabernacle, Oct. 28 and Dec. 2, 1844.

What is more natural\r\nthan that the Land of _Israel_ most strongly attracted the Christian\r\nEnglishman by its past history and its present condition? He could not\r\nlay his hand upon his Bible without being reminded of the _Jordan_,\r\nof the _Lebanon_, of the _Mount of Olives_. Every Sunday called to\r\nhis mind the ancient history and lost prosperity of the “glory of all\r\nlands,” while the existing ruin and desolation of the country gave\r\ntestimony to the truth of the Bible and the certainty of the promised\r\nblessings.\r\n\r\nWhile the familiar passages of Scripture concerning the Restoration\r\nwere calculated to promote human effort in this great cause――for\r\nin many of these passages the spiritual application is not the most\r\nobvious, and all of them seem inspired by the vision of a real and\r\nnatural return to the Land――the Biblical descriptions of the Holy Land\r\ncontributed not less to the propaganda of what we may call the Zionist\r\nidea. There is no country whose geography is, if not better known, at\r\nany rate dearer to the heart of man than that of the land of which the\r\nBible speaks.\r\n\r\nApart from the divine character of the Scriptures, they have handed\r\ndown through the centuries the earliest history of which we have any\r\nrecords, and have preserved for all time records of the economic,\r\ndomestic and political life of a people which inhabited one of the\r\nmost important provinces of the ancient world. The people and the land\r\nare no allegory, no abstraction; they are realities. They still exist,\r\nand they can be brought together again as they were in their natural\r\ncondition. They are both equally typical, almost unique. There is no\r\nother country whose geographical features are so strongly marked as\r\nthose of Palestine, the character of whose inhabitants so strikingly\r\ndepends on peculiarities of position, soil and climate. And there is\r\nno other people whose character, history and destinies are so peculiar\r\nas those of the Jewish people.\r\n\r\nTwo kinds of English organizations, without parallel in any other\r\ncountry――Bible Societies and Palestine Societies――have contributed\r\nparticularly to the investigation of Palestine. Apart from their\r\nconversionist tendency, the Bible Societies were founded in order “to\r\npromote the circulation of the Holy Scriptures, both at home and in\r\nforeign lands.” This idea could take deep hold of the minds of the\r\npeople only in England. The first Bible Society of Great Britain was\r\nfounded in 1802 (Appendix xxxviii). Shortly afterwards――in 1805――a\r\n“Palestine Association”¹ was established for the purpose of promoting\r\nthe knowledge of its geography, natural history and antiquities, with\r\na view to the illustration of the Holy Writings. The inquiries of the\r\nSociety were directed in the first place to ascertaining the natural\r\nand political boundaries of the several districts within the limits\r\nof the Land of _Israel_, the topographical situation of the towns and\r\nvillages, the courses of streams and rivers, the ranges of mountains,\r\nand the manners and customs of the inhabitants. They extended to\r\nthe natural products of the Holy Land and adjacent countries, to\r\npeculiarities of soil, climate and minerals, and to the exploration\r\nfor Jewish antiquities. This was, however, by no means the beginning\r\nof the study of Palestine: it was rather a new organization of the\r\nstudies in question. But notwithstanding the learned and laborious\r\ncompilations of Christianus Adrichomus (1533‒1585), Petrus Ravanellus\r\n(_ob._ 1680), Christophorus Cellarius (1638‒1707), Thomas Fuller\r\n(1608‒1661), John Lightfoot (1602‒1675), and the more recent work of\r\nDom [Antoine] Augustin Calmet (1672‒1757), Johann Heinrich Michaelis\r\n(1668‒1738), Thomas Harmer (1715‒1788), Willem Albert Bachiene\r\n(1712‒1783), and Ijsbrand _van_ Hamelsveld (1743‒1812), many of the\r\nmost important points were still left unexamined. “No country should\r\nbe of so much interest to us as Palestine, and at the same time no\r\ncountry more urgently requires illustration.” With this motto the\r\n“Palestine Association” started its fruitful work, which it continued\r\nduring the whole of the last century with growing skill and success.\r\n\r\n    ¹ Palestine Association. 1805. (Proposals.) _p._ 4. _Saville\r\n      Row_, _March 31, 1805_. [B. M.]\r\n\r\nThe Society known as the “Palestine Exploration Fund” was first\r\nformally constituted in 1865. The object of the founders was the\r\nprosecution of systematic and scientific research in all branches\r\nof inquiry connected with the Holy Land, and the principal reason\r\nalleged for conducting this inquiry was the illustration of the Bible\r\nwhich might be expected to follow such an investigation. The Society\r\nnumbered among its first supporters both Christians and Jews. The\r\nWar Office granted the services of Royal Engineers for the execution\r\nof excavation work――Colonel Claude Reignier Conder (1848‒1910), Sir\r\nCharles William Wilson (1836‒1905), and Sir Charles Warren. Colonel\r\nConder devoted his whole life to Palestinian research. Earl Kitchener\r\n(1850‒1916) surveyed _Galilee_ for the Society, and his work aroused\r\ngeneral interest and led to important results (Appendix xxxix).\r\nHitherto knowledge regarding the country had been very limited;\r\nreconnaissance sketch-maps of parts of the country had been made,\r\nbut every successive traveller was able to point out deficiencies,\r\nerrors and unexplored tracts. With trained skill, thoroughness and\r\nconscientious work the Society combined a love and enthusiasm for\r\nPalestine which made it possible to obtain the most admirable results.\r\nThe progress from the theological character of the first “Palestine\r\nAssociation” to the scientific methods of the “Palestine Exploration\r\nFund” typifies the evolution of the whole Palestinian idea from a\r\ntraditional belief to a great human and historical aspiration――the\r\nsame evolution which can be traced in the development of the Zionist\r\nidea.\r\n\r\n  Illustration:\r\n       _Gen.

One hardly knows whether this was to be\r\ntaken quite seriously. The Jews in _Jerusalem_ appear either not to\r\nhave put much trust in Bonaparte’s flattering words, or to have been\r\nutterly ignorant of the proclamation. The question was so important,\r\nand so much confusion prevailed regarding it, that the appeal,\r\nbeing vague in its terms, could not lead to any practical action.\r\nSome historians suppose that this proclamation was only a trick\r\nwhich Bonaparte played with the intention of winning over to his\r\ncause the Jewish minister of the Pasha of Acre, Haim Mu’allim Farhi\r\n(1750?‒1820), the soul of the defence of that important sea-fortress.\r\nThis supposition, however, is based on no evidence. It is pure\r\nspeculation, and is highly improbable.\r\n\r\nNo Jew seriously believed in the success of Bonaparte’s ambitious\r\ndesign or in the possibility of his victory, and no attention was paid\r\nto his promises. On the other hand, it would not have been impossible\r\nto suppose that Bonaparte’s plan might succeed after he had conquered\r\nSyria and carried the war into the heart of Turkey. He would then\r\nperhaps have assigned a share in his government to members of the\r\nJewish nation upon whom the French could rely.\r\n\r\nBonaparte’s idea was simple and his intentions were sincere. He\r\nregarded the Jews――particularly those living in Asia and Africa――as\r\na nation, and as having indisputable historical claims on the Holy\r\nLand and _Jerusalem_. He was sure that they would help him and hail\r\nhis victory as a happy triumph¹ if they knew that their national ideal\r\nwas to be realized and “ancient _Jerusalem_” to be restored to its\r\n“pristine splendour.” Was this not the same policy which he applied in\r\nlater years in his relations with the small nationalities in Europe?\r\n\r\n    ¹ In an Order, in which he confirms the prerogatives of the\r\n      Monks of the Mount _Sinai_ convent, he refers to the Jews.\r\n\r\n              AU CAIRE, le 29 frimaire au 7 (19 décembre, 1798).\r\n\r\n      Bonaparte, général en chef, voulant favoriser le convent du\r\n      mont _Sinai_: ... 2º Par respect pour _Moise_ et le nation\r\n      juive, dont la cosmogonie nous retrace les âgres les plus\r\n      reculés; ...

Paris ...\r\n      M.DCCC.XIX. _p._ 179.)\r\n\r\n      In another Appeal, Bonaparte ordered his troops to treat\r\n      the natives with tolerance: “Agissez avec eux comme vous\r\n      avez agi avec les Juifs, les Italiens; ayez des égards\r\n      pour leur mufti et leurs imams, comme vous en avez eu pour\r\n      les rabbins et les evêques; ayez pour les cérémonies que\r\n      prescrit l’Alcoran, pour les mosquées, la même tolérance\r\n      que vous avez eu pour les convents, pour les synagogues,\r\n      pour la religion de _Moise_ et de Jésus Christ”\r\n      (Proclamation of General Bonaparte of the 22nd June, 1798).\r\n\r\n      Colonel Sebastiani wrote concerning the Jews in his report\r\n      on his mission to Constantinople in 1802 in a somewhat\r\n      anti-Semitic spirit: “Les Juifs sont, comme partout ailleurs,\r\n      indifférents sur tout changement de gouvernement qui ne\r\n      leur offre pas la matière à de nouvelles spéculations”\r\n      (_Bibliothèque Diplomatique――Recueil des Traités de la\r\n      Porte Ottomane_ ... Par le Baron J. _de_ Testa ... Tome\r\n      Premier France. Paris ... MDCCCLXIV. _p._ 513).\r\n\r\nJewish opinion in the East was reserved and somewhat pessimistic,\r\nnot with regard to the purpose, but concerning the opportunity and\r\nthe means. The Jews were willing to make any sacrifices in order to\r\nrestore “ancient _Jerusalem_” in a peaceful way, but not to revolt\r\nagainst the rulers of the country. Moreover, they knew that this\r\ncampaign was bound to be a failure.\r\n\r\nThe Turks followed the plan of allowing the inadequate forces of\r\nBonaparte to advance as far as possible from their Egyptian base,\r\nwhile they massed heavy forces in Syria. El-Arish and _Gaza_ in the\r\nsouth-west of Palestine fell into the hands of Bonaparte’s army on the\r\n17th and 25th February, 1799. The Jewish community of _Gaza_ had fled.\r\nIn _Jerusalem_ the news of victories and atrocities created a general\r\npanic. It was rumoured that Bonaparte was about to enter the Holy\r\nCity. At the command of the deputy Governor the inhabitants began to\r\nthrow up ramparts, the Jews also taking part in the work. One of the\r\n_Rabbis_, Moses Mordecai Joseph Meyuchas, encouraged and even assisted\r\nthem in their operations. After these occurrences the success of\r\nBonaparte in Egypt and Syria was arrested, chiefly by the arms of\r\nGreat Britain, and his schemes in the East were frustrated.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of Bonaparte in Palestine was like the passing of a\r\nmeteor, which, after causing much perturbance, disappears. His dream\r\nof becoming Emperor of the East faded away quickly. Still the fact\r\nremains that the idea of the Restoration of _Israel_ had occupied the\r\nmind of this great conqueror in the prime of his youth, at the very\r\nbeginning of his unexampled career. He and his adherents seemed, even\r\nafter this failure, to persist in gazing with a wistful eye towards\r\nthe same quarter, and their ambitious plans evidently involved the\r\nfuture fortunes of those Eastern countries which have so long been\r\nthe monotonous scenes of isolation and ignorance.\r\n\r\nWhatever judgment we may form as to the practical value of Bonaparte’s\r\nscheme in those days, the suggestion of restoring Palestine to the\r\nJews remains highly significant. It is obvious that had there not\r\nbeen Jewish aspirations of this kind in France such a suggestion could\r\nnot have arisen even as a fantastic plan or as a caprice of military\r\nheadquarters in a distant country. Bonaparte had too much political\r\nforesight even in his younger years to run the risk of engaging\r\nhimself in an undertaking before he had sounded the competent circles\r\nin his own country. As a matter of fact these aspirations were\r\nexpressed, and, imaginary as they were, seem to have been very popular\r\namong French Jews. There is, consequently, reason to conclude that\r\nBonaparte’s scheme was, in reality, more serious than it might have\r\nseemed at first sight.\r\n\r\nA most curious document, almost entirely overlooked or underestimated\r\nby French historians, throws some light on the real tendencies of that\r\ntime among French Jews. This is a “Letter addressed to his brethren by\r\na Jew” in 1798¹――one year before the Bonaparte Proclamation (Appendix\r\nxli). This letter is a sort of Zionist programme. It is a mixture\r\nof different elements, partly Jewish, partly pan-French Imperialist,\r\nexpounded in a manner that only a deep Jewish national feeling could\r\nhave inspired. The impenetrable political speculations of those days\r\nalready contain the germs of some ideas which are developed to full\r\nconsciousness and clearness a hundred years later in modern Zionist\r\nspeeches, pamphlets and programmes.\r\n\r\n    ¹ Restoration of the Jews ... Second Edition ... By J. Bicheno.\r\n      1807. _pp._ 60‒62.\r\n\r\nThe author of this “Letter” rightly proclaims in the first place the\r\npre-eminent interest of his theme, “the greatest theme of Jewish\r\nhistory.” “It is at last time to shake off this insupportable yoke――it\r\nis time to resume our rank among the other nations of the universe.”\r\nThe nations of the world――he now hopes――will support the Jewish claim\r\nthat the Jewish nation should be treated on the lines of the national\r\nidea. The design of the author, then, is to suggest a solution of\r\nno less a problem than the Jewish Tragedy. He begins with a review\r\n“of the Jewish situation during many ages under the weight of the\r\ncruellest persecutions,” and this review is not less tragic than the\r\nJewish elegies of the Middle Ages, though it was written a few years\r\nafter the great Revolution. He then addresses himself to his main task,\r\nthe exposition, based, as far as he is able to base it, on lessons\r\nlearnt from contemporary events, of that system of Restoration which\r\nhe regards as the most practical.\r\n\r\nThis author was, no doubt, the agent and mouthpiece of the people\r\nbehind him. The fact that this “Letter” was published at the\r\nsuggestion of those then in power in France shows that the scheme\r\nsuggested in it was in accordance with the views of the Government.\r\nThis being the tendency of the Government, the appeal addressed\r\nby Bonaparte to the Jews of Asia and Africa one year after the\r\npublication of the “Letter,” in 1798, appears to be a logical\r\nconsequence of prevailing opinions. Moreover, the fact that schemes\r\nof this kind had gained great currency in England, and that the\r\nRestoration of _Israel_ was a favourite idea of the English, could\r\nnot be unknown in France. It is scarcely necessary to point out what\r\nwas the fundamental idea of the Egyptian and Syrian campaign. The idea\r\nof the Restoration of _Israel_, as suggested in the “Letter of the\r\nFrench Jew” in 1798 and in Bonaparte’s Appeal of 1799, was merely a\r\nlink in the same chain.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, the situation of affairs, in view of the possibility of\r\ngreat changes in the East, seemed to afford an opportunity for the\r\nsolution of the Jewish problem on national lines. Bonaparte may also\r\nhave been anxious to avail himself of the services of the Jews of\r\nAsia and Africa. But the essential point is that many influential\r\nChristians as well as Jews considered the Jewish problem from a\r\nnational point of view at the end of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n                              HAIM FARHI\r\n\r\n    Saul Farhi――Ahmad Jazzár――Saul Farhi’s sons: Haim, Solomon,\r\n    Raphael and Moses Farhi――Jewish communities in Palestine and\r\n    Syria――The importance of Palestine in the struggle between\r\n    Bonaparte and the Ottoman Empire――Haim Farhi’s martyrdom.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN order to grasp the real importance and meaning of Bonaparte’s idea,\r\nwe have to occupy ourselves with the _dramatis personæ_, and first of\r\nall with Haim Farhi. The life of this man was full of romance and of\r\na devotion which has not yet met with such appreciation from Jewish\r\nhistorians as it deserves.\r\n\r\nHaim Farhi was born at Damascus about the middle of the eighteenth\r\ncentury. The Farhis were an old Jewish family, whose members for\r\nseveral generations devoted their energies to the task of defending\r\ntheir ancient nation, while remaining loyal subjects of the Ottoman\r\nGovernment. Haim’s father, Saul, was “_Katib_” to Ahmad Jazzár\r\n(1735?‒1808), who was first _Pasha_ of Acre and Sidon, then for a\r\nfew years _Pasha_ of Damascus, and afterwards for many years again\r\n_Pasha_ of Acre and Sidon, and exercised a great influence over Syria\r\nand Palestine. Ahmad Jazzár (the Butcher) was a man without morals,\r\nas cruel as he was capricious and impetuous. Instead of using his\r\ninfluence and great wealth to promote the happiness of his subjects,\r\nhe left the large plain near Acre almost a marsh. Pomp and luxury\r\nwere greatly encouraged by him, while agriculture was neglected.\r\nHis conduct was the exact opposite of that of the Sheikh Daher, his\r\npredecessor, who raised Acre from a village to a large town, and\r\nduring whose reign the population of the district increased immensely.\r\nThe main source of the riches of Jazzár was the _pashalik_ of Damascus,\r\nwhich he contrived to add to his former dominion. Till the year 1791\r\nthe French had factories at Acre, Sidon and Beyrout. In that year\r\nthey were all expelled from the territory of Jazzár by a sudden edict,\r\nwhich allowed them only three days in which to leave their respective\r\nabodes, under the penalty of death.\r\n\r\nJazzár retained his ill-gotten _pashalik_ of Damascus a few years only.\r\nHis government knew no methods but those of oppression and cruelty;\r\nhe extorted from his people a considerable part of its fortunes, and\r\nput to death several hundred persons, who were mostly innocent. His\r\nown suspicious conduct, as leader of the caravan to Mecca, combined\r\nwith the machinations of his enemies at the Porte, led finally to his\r\ndeposition; but he left behind living monuments of his cruelty in the\r\nshape of mutilated subjects who by his orders had had their noses and\r\nears cut off. Thus driven from Damascus, he returned to his former\r\n_pashalik_ of Acre and Sidon.\r\n\r\nJazzár, who was full of energy and life, and was possessed of\r\nsome heroic qualities, but was a monster in human form, and a\r\ntrue specimen of the Eastern “_satrap_,” addressed himself to his\r\n_Katib_ for assistance and advice. _Katib_ in Arabic, like _Yazgy_\r\nin Turkish, means no more than “writer” or “scribe,” but the office\r\nconfers greater power than the name implies. The _Katib_ is often\r\nat once government secretary and treasurer; and, as he is generally\r\na permanent official in the _pashalik_ for life, while the _pashas_\r\nare often changed, by removal or death, it necessarily happens that\r\nhe is master of the business of the _pashalik_, and of its revenues\r\nand resources, while the _pashas_, coming from distant provinces,\r\nenter upon a rule of which the key is in the _Katib’s_ hands, and are\r\ncompelled to keep him in their service and to be guided by him. The\r\n_pashalik_ of Damascus was, moreover, singularly placed, in so far as\r\nits _pasha_ and chief officials had to go every year on the pilgrimage\r\nto Mecca, and consequently were more than ever bound to confide\r\ntheir affairs to the _Katib_. It is said that the order of march,\r\nthe ordinances and regulations for the pilgrims, the quantity of\r\nprovisions required and various other essential facts connected with\r\nthis important occasion, had somehow become secrets in the keeping\r\nof the Jews, and that Saul Farhi was considered a great expert and a\r\nrecognized authority in these matters. He had four sons: Haim, Solomon,\r\nRaphael and Moses (_ob._ 1840) and one daughter. Haim, the eldest,\r\nwas initiated by his father into all the professional secrets of\r\nhis office. He was a young man of excellent abilities and learning.\r\nIn the early part of his life, when he was still in Damascus, the\r\nmachinations of his enemies prevailed in so far that he was summoned\r\nto Constantinople to answer certain accusations made against him; and,\r\nbeing mulcted in a fine which he was unable to pay, he was thrown into\r\nprison. His sister, a woman of great energy, undertook the journey\r\nfrom Syria to Constantinople to petition for her brother’s release.\r\nShe succeeded, and brought her brother back to his house. Haim’s\r\nloyalty and integrity were placed beyond doubt, and his experiences in\r\nConstantinople must have helped to give him knowledge of the laws and\r\ninsight into the central government, to which he was sincerely devoted.\r\nHe was then appointed by Jazzár to the post of _Katib_ or minister\r\nat Acre, where there lived at that time thirty-six Jewish families.\r\n_Jerusalem_ had, besides 9000 Moslem and Christian inhabitants,\r\nabout 1000 Jews; and old communities of considerable size existed in\r\n_Tiberias_, _Safed_, _Jaffa_ and _Hebron_. Although not important in\r\nnumbers, the Jews, owing to their connection with the communities of\r\nDamascus, Aleppo, Bagdad, Constantinople, Smyrna and Salonica, which\r\npossessed numerous religious schools, and big business enterprises\r\nextending as far as Egypt and India, were justly considered an\r\nimportant element. The fact that Saul Farhi was _Katib_ at Damascus,\r\nand his son Haim at Acre, and that, according to the general opinion,\r\nthe Jews were better acquainted than anyone else with the route\r\nto Mecca, and with the ordinances and regulations, which were not\r\nonly of a fiscal and commercial value, but also of great strategic\r\nimportance――this fact did not fail to appeal to the imagination\r\nof Bonaparte. From this point of view, and considering all the\r\ncircumstances, it would appear that Bonaparte’s appeal to the Jews\r\nwas not so fantastic as it might seem at first sight. It was a\r\nwell-considered scheme.\r\n\r\nHaim Farhi’s activity was twofold. It fell to his lot to look after\r\nthe communications with Damascus and the Hedjaz, to remain in touch\r\nwith all the distant centres of commerce and resources, and at the\r\nsame time to cultivate very carefully relations with Constantinople.\r\nBoth these departments of official activity abounded with difficulties\r\nand responsibilities. The roads were bad, the tribes, clans, and\r\nfamilies much divided and continually at feud with one another.\r\nCommunications were unsafe, and the danger of being cut off was always\r\nimminent. On the other hand, the maintenance of peaceful relations\r\nbetween a powerful, capricious _Pasha_ and the _Padishah_ with all his\r\ncamarilla was naturally a hard task. Farhi had secured a reputation\r\nfor exceptional ability in both directions. Having been brought up\r\nin the atmosphere of the _Katib’s_ profession, he was better informed\r\nthan anyone else concerning the communications and the state of\r\naffairs in Damascus and elsewhere, while his dignity of manner, worthy\r\nof the descendant of an old Jewish family, his intellectual gifts and\r\nwonderful knowledge of Eastern languages, enabled him to cope most\r\nsuccessfully with the duties of a diplomatic career. As to the latter\r\nfunction, there is the testimony of Jazzár, to whom is ascribed the\r\nstatement that “Farhi’s notes to the Porte have the wonderful quality\r\nof being polite as well as expressive.”\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, Farhi’s influence and activity, which would have been\r\nimportant even in times of peace, proved of exceptional importance at\r\nthe eventful period when for the first time since the Crusades East\r\nand West were involved in a struggle for existence. It was one of the\r\nstrangest caprices of history that this contest of strength between\r\nthe greatest powers of the world――Bonaparte and the Ottoman Empire of\r\nthat time, backed up by Great Britain――was to be decided in the Holy\r\nLand, in the neighbourhood of that little port, and that a son of the\r\nnation which had possessed this land and made it a land of glory, and\r\nto which God had promised it as an “everlasting inheritance,” was the\r\nvery soul of the defence, frustrating all the plans of the enemy.\r\n\r\nHaim’s career, romantic as it was, derives a peculiar interest from\r\none of its incidents, which makes the _Pasha_ appear as a monster\r\nof barbarity and madness. The story sounds like the invention of a\r\nwild imagination, but is a real, indisputable fact. We mentioned with\r\nregard to Jazzár’s activities in Damascus that living monuments of his\r\ncruelty remained behind in the shape of the noseless faces and earless\r\nheads of the Damascenes. This passion for maiming and mutilating seems\r\nto have grown with him in Acre.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. John Wilson¹ (1804‒1875) tells us: “Almost every one in his\r\ndomestic establishment was maimed. Some wanted a hand, some a foot;\r\nothers mourned over the loss of a toe, a finger or an ear, according\r\nas the rage of the tyrant happened to be directed. Haim Farhi was\r\nan able man and withal of fine figure and prepossessing address. He\r\nenjoyed the confidence of the _Pasha_, and grew rich in his employment.\r\nOne day Ahmad (Jazzár) said to him: ‘Haim, you have a fine person, you\r\nare very beautiful, you are the most athletic of men; when visitors\r\ncome, it is you, not me, they admire; every one seems to say how\r\nhappy is the _Pasha_ to have such a man: Now, because of this I had\r\nsome thoughts of dismissing you from your office; but my great love\r\nto you prevents that; you cannot, however, have any objection to my\r\nputting out one of your eyes.’ The barber was instantly sent for; and\r\nHaim Farhi lost his eye. He continued in his office, and faithfully\r\ndischarged its duties, and the _Pasha_ continued to heap favours\r\nupon him. The Jew, however, was attentive to his appearance, and\r\ndexterously contrived to edge down his turban so skilfully that his\r\nvisual defect was not much observed. Jazzár noticed this, and said to\r\nhim one day, ‘All I have done has been of no use, you have become as\r\nbeautiful and as attractive as ever; I must cut off your nose.’ The\r\nbarber was again sent for, and Haim lost his nose. He still continued\r\nin the service of the _Pasha_, and discharged his duties faithfully,\r\nand even presided over the obsequies of his tyrannical benefactor.”\r\n\r\n    ¹ Land of the Bible ...

Note 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n                        NAPOLEON IN PALESTINE\r\n\r\n    Bonaparte approaching _Jerusalem_――Anti-Jewish accusations\r\n    ――Bonaparte and the Christians――Suleiman _Pasha_――Abdallah\r\n    _Pasha_――Haim Farhi’s martyr death――The Farhi family\r\n    ――Generations of martyrs.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHROUGH the primitive but excellent channels of information of the\r\nEastern caravans, Bedouins and Dervishes, Bonaparte must have heard\r\nof this treatment of the Jewish minister by the “Butcher,” and of the\r\nother atrocities committed by him. The expulsion of the French from\r\nAcre, Sidon and Beyrout by this _Pasha_ in 1791 was still fresh in his\r\nmemory as an insult to France.\r\n\r\nHaim Farhi continued his services; his popularity suffered no\r\ndiminution, and it was evidently he who provided Acre with the\r\nnecessary supplies, kept communications open with the hinterland, and\r\nmade it possible to offer the stoutest resistance ever recorded in\r\nhistory. Great Britain helped, the Turks and Arabs were brave, and\r\nJazzár with all his savage caprices possessed, no doubt, remarkable\r\nabilities as a general; but the soul of the entire organization was\r\nHaim. Winning him over would have meant breaking down the defence;\r\nbut it was impossible to win him over.\r\n\r\nUnder such conditions Bonaparte approached _Jerusalem_. He had reached\r\n_Ramleh_ (between _Jaffa_ and _Jerusalem_) and intended to besiege\r\nthe Holy City, but he changed his mind and turned to Acre. Meanwhile\r\nrumours spread that the Jews were helping the French as spies, and\r\nthat they sympathized in their hearts with Bonaparte. This is the\r\nfamiliar story which hatred and calumny set on foot whenever people\r\nare excited, and there is any opportunity of stirring up thoughtless\r\ncredulity and brutal instincts against a weak and defenceless minority.\r\nBonaparte captured _Gaza_ on the 25th December, 1799. The Jews of\r\nthat place had to endure brutal treatment at the hands of Bonaparte’s\r\nsoldiers, so that many seized the opportunity of escaping. The Jews of\r\n_Jerusalem_ were, meanwhile, in the greatest danger of being massacred\r\nby the Mohammedan inhabitants, who accused them of being in secret\r\ncommunication with Bonaparte with a view to the surrender of the city.\r\nThe Mohammedans actually believed that all the Jews of _Jerusalem_\r\nwere spies and traitors, and they secretly resolved among themselves\r\nto kill all the Jewish inhabitants as soon as Napoleon marched on\r\n_Jerusalem_. This resolution, however, got abroad and was communicated\r\nby a Mohammedan, a confidant and friend of the Jews, to two\r\n_Rabbis_ named Algazi and Meyuchas, who saved Palestinian Jewry, and\r\nparticularly the _Jerusalem_ Jews, by their presence of mind and wise\r\nprecautions, such as arranging public prayers, helping to fortify\r\nthe city, _etc._ The sight of the venerable, grey-headed _Haham_\r\nMeyuchas standing with a spade in his hand did not fail to impress the\r\nMohammedans. The Jewish community was thus saved; still at _Tiberias_\r\nand _Safed_ the Jews were savagely treated by Bonaparte’s soldiers.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to know who circulated the accusation against the\r\nJews. Such accusations are like proverbs; nobody knows their author,\r\nthey are in the air, they appeal to the imagination, gain currency and\r\nsubsequently become dogmas; nobody has examined their soundness, there\r\nis no evidence, no reason, there is merely a vague generalization,\r\nand yet people believe in them. We cannot know what some Jews may\r\nhave thought of Bonaparte’s attempt: oppressed, persecuted, insulted\r\nas they were by the Jazzárs, some of them may have thought that\r\nBonaparte’s victory would be their salvation, although, on the other\r\nhand, the behaviour of his soldiers caused great suffering. But in\r\npractice the Jews were most loyally devoted to the Ottoman cause.\r\n\r\nThe Jews were saved, and the outraged Farhi remained in service.\r\nAccording to the testimony of all his Christian contemporaries, this\r\nJew, like a real Christian, “loved his enemy.” When Jazzár died,\r\nin 1808, he arranged the ceremonies of the funeral with remarkable\r\ndevotion. Jazzár was succeeded by Suleiman _Pasha_, who confirmed Haim\r\nin his dignity. Suleiman, an _ex-mameluk_, ruled with Farhi sixteen\r\nyears, and this was the happiest period for Palestine. Suleiman died\r\nin 1824, and Abdallah, the son of Ali _Pasha_ of Tripoli (_ob._ 1815\r\nat Acre), who was educated and looked after with great care by Farhi,\r\nwas appointed _Pasha_ of Acre. Very soon after the appointment of\r\nAbdallah _Pasha_ the Jewish minister came to a tragic end. Abdallah\r\nshowed himself not an impetuous barbarian of the Jazzár type, but\r\na miserable and treacherous murderer. Jealous of his benefactor’s\r\npopularity, and seeing that it was impossible to disfigure him further,\r\nhe ordered his _Kiaja_ (minister of the police) to assassinate the\r\nold and venerable statesman, and to throw his body into the sea. The\r\nimplacable tyrant was deaf to the entreaties of the dead man’s family\r\nand friends, who implored him to allow the body to be buried. It\r\nis said that the body was left floating for several days near the\r\nharbour, and that the _Pasha_ ordered his servants to attach heavy\r\nstones to it and then to throw it into the sea. Farhi’s property,\r\nthe personal fortune which he had acquired not as the result of his\r\nofficial occupation but as a member of an old and wealthy family,\r\nwas ransacked and confiscated. His family escaped, and his widow\r\ndied, in consequence of hardships, on her way to Damascus. As to the\r\npretext for the murder of Farhi there are various accounts. According\r\nto Damoiseau, a French renegade, Abdallah (in whose service he\r\nwas) proposed the building of some new fortifications. There was no\r\npractical reason for the fortifications; relations with the European\r\npowers being friendly, the measure could only stimulate the suspicions\r\nof the Porte. Moved by these reasons and by considerations of economy,\r\nFarhi objected. He was sentenced to death, and the _Kiaja_ was\r\nauthorized to carry out the execution. This he did by attacking the\r\nold man suddenly in his house, and murdering him in the night. But\r\nAbdallah never thought afterwards of building any new fortification.\r\nThe version given by _Rabbi_ Joseph Schwarz (1804‒1860) in his\r\n_T’buoth Ha’arez_ (Jerusalem, 1845) is somewhat different in details,\r\nbut the facts are essentially the same. Another traveller, Professor\r\nJ. M. A. Scholz (1794‒1852), happened to be at that time in the\r\nneighbourhood of Acre, and he confirms the first version. He gives\r\nalso the precise date of the assassination: the 24th August, 1824.\r\n\r\nPeaceful and loyal as the Jews in the East were, this monstrous crime\r\nseems to have put an end to their great patience. The brothers of Haim\r\nin Damascus arranged to send an expedition of revenge. This was the\r\nfirst time for several centuries that Jews had gone forth as fighters\r\nin their own cause. The _Pashas_ of Aleppo and Damascus concluded\r\na treaty, and supported the expedition arranged by the Farhis. They\r\nbesieged Acre, and had it not been for a spy sent to the camp of the\r\nFarhis, who succeeded in treacherously poisoning Solomon Farhi, the\r\nexpedition would have had an excellent chance of success. The death\r\nof Solomon, however, put an end to the expedition, of which he was the\r\norganizer and leader. The last survivor of Haim’s brothers was Raphael.\r\nHe also was a distinguished statesman. He was Minister at Damascus in\r\n1820, and after the restoration of Ottoman rule in Syria was elected\r\nto the Council of that town.\r\n\r\nRev. John Wilson¹ gives a further account of his visits to Damascus\r\nin 1843. “6th June.――Mr. Graham and I visited the house of the chief\r\n_Rabbi_, Haim Maimon Tobhi. He had been eighteen years resident at\r\nDamascus, but is a native of Gibraltar. He had obtained, he said,\r\nan English passport, entitling him to British protection, from Lord\r\nPalmerston (1784‒1865); and he had been elected to office on account\r\nof the privilege which he thus enjoyed, it having been conceived by\r\nthe Jews, that the name of an English subject, borne by him, would\r\ngive weight to his dealings with the Turkish Government” (_Ib._ 330).\r\n“On the second day of our excursions among the Jews we visited one of\r\nthe princely mansions of the Farhis, the richest bankers and merchants\r\nof Damascus.” In a footnote Wilson quotes [Sir John] Bowring’s [F.R.S.]\r\n(1792‒1872) _Report on Syria_, _p._ 94: “As a class, the Jewish\r\nforeign merchants of Damascus are the most wealthy.... The two most\r\nopulent are believed to be Mourad Farhi and (Raphael) Nassim Farhi,\r\nwhose wealth in trade exceeds one and a half millions each. Most of\r\nthe Jewish foreign houses trade with Great Britain.” In the first of\r\nthese mansions Wilson admired the library, containing nearly the whole\r\nof Jewish literature, to which Jewish students had free access for\r\npurposes of study. He met there some of the _Rabbis_, who told him\r\nthat the Jews of Damascus were supposed to number 5000 souls, and\r\nthose of Aleppo 6000. He and Mr. Graham, who accompanied him, were\r\nthen introduced to the female members of the household, who “deported\r\nthemselves with a dignity and grace which would have done credit to\r\nthe nobility of Europe.” “On the 8th of June we visited the mansion of\r\nRaphael, the chief of the Farhis. On our arrival we were received by\r\na Jew, who humbly described himself to us as the ‘worthless Jacob\r\nPeretz,’ a quondam tutor to the children of the great man, and who in\r\nacknowledgment of his services is, with his whole family, retained as\r\npart of his household, which, he informed us, consists of from between\r\nsixty to seventy souls.” This establishment was even grander than that\r\nwhich we visited yesterday.... Mr. Graham expressed his doubts whether\r\nthose in our own Royal palaces are superior to them. He then gives\r\nparticulars of the principal apartments and reproduces a _Hebrew_\r\ninscription with an English translation (of his own). Of special\r\ninterest is Mr. Wilson’s description of the head of the family,\r\nRaphael, the Nasi of the Damascus Jews, an old man who was at that\r\ntime seriously indisposed, but received him and his friend with great\r\nkindness, and took them to his library, which was very large.\r\n\r\n    ¹ Land of the Bible. _Ibid._, _pp._ 330‒341.\r\n\r\nIn 1840, during the riots following the accusation against the Jews,\r\nRaphael and his sons suffered very severely. Raphael died very soon\r\nafter Wilson’s visit. This was the end of this Jewish family, whose\r\nhistory is bound up with the history of Palestine and Bonaparte’s\r\nexpedition. They have a twofold claim upon our attention, first as\r\neminent Jewish statesmen, and secondly as Palestinian martyrs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n                        TWO _JERUSALEM RABBIS_\r\n\r\n    _Rabbi_ Moses Mordecai Joseph Meyuchas――The Spanish Jewish\r\n    traditions――_Rabbi_ Israel Jacob Algazi――The importance of the\r\n    Jewish settlement in Palestine――Zionist aspirations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO obtain an idea of the views and aspirations of the Jews of\r\nPalestine in that period we may glance at two _Hahamim_ of\r\n_Jerusalem_――Moses Mordecai Joseph Meyuchas and Israel Jacob Algazi.\r\n\r\n_Haham_ Samuel Moses Mordecai Joseph _de_ Raphael _de_ Meyuchas was\r\nborn in 1738 and died in _Jerusalem_ in 1806. He was the descendant\r\nof a family of _Rabbis_ and _Talmudic_ scholars of great fame in\r\nPalestine and elsewhere. His most valuable contributions to _Talmudic_\r\nliterature are his three works: _Mayim Shaal_ (Salonica, 5559), _Shaar\r\nHa’mayim_ (Salonica, 5528) and _B’rehot Ha’mayim_ (Salonica, 5549),\r\nwhich show profound scholarship and wide learning. He was on terms\r\nof intimacy with the great _Talmudic_ scholars of his time, who\r\naddressed to him questions on various religious and communal matters.\r\nIn the Preface to his _B’rehot Ha’mayim_ he speaks in exalted terms\r\nof his love “of the dear land, the Golden _Jerusalem_,” and of “the\r\nchangeable events of his time.” He says that he has had much to suffer,\r\nand that, poverty-stricken as he is, he enjoys his miserable existence\r\nand keeps in good spirits; he expresses his humble gratitude to God\r\nfor having allowed him to earn “a piece of dry bread,” and to bear\r\nhis share in building up the city; and adds that his only hope and\r\naspiration is to be able to spend his life there to a very advanced\r\nage. His use of the verse:――\r\n\r\n    “For He hath made strong the bars of thy gates;...”\r\n                                            (Psalm cxlvii. 13).\r\n\r\nin connection with what he describes as the “good idea,” which he\r\n“carried out,” might be taken as an allusion to his remarkable action\r\nin 5559 (1799), when this old _Rabbi_ “stood with spade in hand\r\nlabouring on the fortification of _Jerusalem_, digging and working\r\nwith the greatest industry to make a new bastion and rampart around\r\nthe fort, the Kallai,”¹ were it not for the chronological fact that\r\nhis book was published in 5549 (1789). He is said to have practised\r\nmedicine, and though this was not uncommon among the _Sephardi\r\nHahamim_ of the old generation, it probably indicates that he was\r\na man of wider outlook than that of the usual _Rabbi_ type. It is\r\na mistake to suppose that all Palestinian _Rabbis_ of the older\r\ngeneration were superstitious and hostile to science. The _Sephardi\r\nHahamim_ of that time in particular had preserved something of the\r\nscientific and rationalistic tradition of the Judæo-Spanish school.\r\nSome of them were men of great ability, well versed not only in the\r\n_Talmud_, but also in Oriental languages. They cherished an intense\r\nand sincere love for the Holy Land, and, if the position of the Jewish\r\npeople in the country was maintained, through all the horrors and\r\ndangers of war and plague, stress and danger, it was due to the\r\nself-denial and the wonderful moral strength of those noble martyrs\r\nwho guided and inspired the down-trodden people. Mostly descendants\r\nof the Spanish-Jewish fugitives who found refuge and shelter in the\r\ndominions of the _Sultan_, their loyalty and gratitude to their rulers\r\nwere sincere and deep-rooted. The _Jerusalem Rabbis_ were attached\r\nto their masters and friends in Constantinople, Salonica, Smyrna,\r\nDamascus and Aleppo. The Jewish communities, particularly those in\r\ndistant parts of the Ottoman Empire, suffered severe afflictions from\r\ntime to time, but they bore their heavy burdens with fortitude and\r\nresignation in order to maintain and to strengthen their foothold in\r\nthe country. They trusted in the justice of the Central Government,\r\nand did not expect anything of Bonaparte’s invasion, or of any other\r\ninvasion of the kind.\r\n\r\n    ¹ _Sepher T’buoth Ha’arez_, by Joseph _ben_ Menachem Schwarz,\r\n      _Jerusalem_, 5605.\r\n\r\n_Haham_ Meyuchas was at that time _Dayan_.¹ Another scholar of great\r\nauthority was the Chief _Rabbi_ of _Jerusalem_, _H.H.R._ Israel Jacob\r\nAlgazi, a great-grandson of _Haham_ Solomon Algazi the Elder (who\r\nwas _Rabbi_ in Smyrna and in _Jerusalem_ in the seventeenth century,\r\nwrote on all subjects of _Rabbinic_ literature, and contributed much\r\nto the science of _Talmudic_ methodology). _Haham_ I. J. Algazi wrote\r\nsome valuable books on homiletics and _Halachah_, which testify to\r\nhis exceptional genius and astonishing industry. He was an excellent\r\n_Rabbi_, possessed of a keen intellect and a high sense of duty.\r\nHis books _She’erith Jacob_ (Constantinople, 5511) and _Neoth Jacob_\r\n(Smyrna, 5527) contain many chapters that bear testimony to his ardent\r\ndesire for the development of the Jewish community in the Holy Land.\r\n\r\n    ¹ Ecclesiastical Assessor.\r\n\r\nWe read with special interest the books written by these two rabbis\r\nduring that troublous period. These books are distinguished by the\r\nhighest intellectual ability. There is nowhere a trace of weariness,\r\nlanguor or even indifference to be found; on the contrary, freshness,\r\nstrength and unsatisfied intellectual impulse are throughout\r\ndiscernible. Living ideas pervade them all. It is impossible for any\r\nreader who is a _Talmudic_ student not to be touched by their depth\r\nand force of sentiment, and their exceptional vigour and eloquence, in\r\nspite of the usual clumsiness and complexity due to the old _Rabbinic_\r\nlanguage. It is indeed a relief to turn from the intrigues of the\r\nPashas and the bloodshed of the expeditions to _Haham_ Jacob Israel\r\nAlgazi, who writes in a reply to the Leghorn Jews: “We are here\r\ninsignificant in numbers, modest in our requirements, and we pray God\r\nthat we may become self-supporting. We have to be here for the sake\r\nof our ancestors and our children’s children. This question is not\r\nof appearances, but of realities; not of delights, but of duties; not\r\nof private option, but of divine authority.” Both these _Rabbis_ deal\r\nwith Palestinian affairs in an elevating spirit and from an idealistic\r\npoint of view. Whatsoever is in Palestine is holy and sublime, and\r\nall Jews are bound to support the _Yishub_.¹ This is the keynote of\r\nall their ideas. _Haham_ M. M. J. Meyuchas writes to Salonica: “We\r\nhave in our community some artisans, too few for our nation――because\r\nthey should be more numerous here――and too many for the charities\r\nto support them when they are workless; more wealthy people should\r\ncome here.” And _Haham_ Algazi discusses the question of the special\r\n_Rabbinical_ rules concerning the right of the community to inherit\r\nthe property of rich Jews who die in Palestine leaving relatives in\r\nother countries. “It is not the community,” says the learned _Rabbi_,\r\n“it is the whole of _Israel_ which is the ♦inheritor in this way....\r\nOur people, so long scattered, oppressed, and trodden down, and\r\nwonderful from the beginning till now, should never despair. Israel\r\nis not deserted,” he says in another passage. The aspirations of\r\nan ancient people, as he knew, do not depend on the intrigues and\r\nadventures of _Pashas_, and will outlive all these passing incidents.\r\n\r\n    ¹ A Settlement.\r\n\r\n    ♦ “iheritor” replaced with “inheritor”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n                        NAPOLEON’S _SANHEDRIN_\r\n\r\n    The “_Sanhedrin_”――R.

The “Great\r\n_Sanhedrin_,” a feature of the ancient Jewish Government which had\r\nperished together with the Second Temple, and which alone had been\r\nendowed with unlimited religious authority in _Israel_, was to be\r\nrevived in modern times, in the centre of civilized Europe, for\r\nthe purpose of ♦making decisions which would command indisputable\r\nrecognition on the part of Jews in all countries and throughout all\r\ncenturies. “A great event,” wrote one of the leading Jews of that time,\r\n“is about to take place, one which through a long series of centuries\r\nour fathers, and even we in our own times, never expected to see,\r\nand which has now appeared before the eyes of the astonished world.\r\nThe 20th of October (1807) has been fixed as the date of the Great\r\n_Sanhedrin_ in the capital of one of the most powerful Christian\r\nnations, and under the protection of the great Prince who rules over\r\nit. Paris will thus show to the world a remarkable scene, and this\r\nmemorable event will open to the dispersed remnants of the descendants\r\nof _Abraham_ a period of deliverance and prosperity.”\r\n\r\n    ♦ “taking” replaced with “making”\r\n\r\n  Illustration:            GRAND SANHÉDRIN\r\n\r\n        Convoqué à Paris par ordre de Napoléon-le-Grand, 1807\r\n\r\n                _Damame de Martrait, del. et Sculpt._\r\n    _From an aquatint printed in colours lent by Israel Solomons_\r\n\r\nOn the 9th February, 1807, the Grand _Sanhedrin_ assembled at the\r\nGrand Synagogue in Paris under the Presidency of _Rabbi_ David\r\nSintzheim (1745‒1812) of Strasburg. Service was read in _Hebrew_,\r\nFrench and Italian; an excellent discourse was delivered by the\r\nPresident in the first-named language. After his discourse he took\r\na scroll of the Law from the Ark and blessed the Assembly, and then\r\nrecited a prayer for the Emperor, the glory of his arms, and the\r\nreturn of peace. From the Synagogue the Assembly adjourned to the\r\nHôtel de Ville, where, after appropriate speeches from the most\r\ndistinguished members, the Committee appointed by the late First\r\nConsul laid before the _Sanhedrin_ a general plan of organization\r\nfor Mosaic worship, consisting of twenty-seven articles. According to\r\nthis plan a Consistory and Synagogue were to be established in each\r\nDepartment containing 2000 Jews; those of the persuasion who intended\r\nto reside in France were to announce their intention to the Consistory\r\nwithin three months of their arrival on French territory; there was to\r\nbe a Central Consistory in Paris, consisting of five persons, of whom\r\nthree were to be _Rabbis_; and none were to be appointed _Rabbis_ who\r\nwere not naturalized in France or in the Kingdom of Italy. The\r\nfunctions of the _Rabbis_ were to be:――\r\n\r\n1. To give instruction in religious matters.\r\n\r\n2. To inculcate the precepts contained in the decisions of the Grand\r\n_Sanhedrin_.\r\n\r\n3. To preach complete obedience to the laws, and particularly to\r\nthose enjoining the defence of the country, and above all, to exert\r\nthemselves every year during the time of conscription, from the first\r\nsummons to the complete carrying out of the law, in exhorting their\r\nfollowers to conform to that measure.\r\n\r\n4. To impress the need for military service upon the Jews as a sacred\r\nduty, and to explain to them that so long as they devoted themselves\r\nto that service, their religion would give them a dispensation from\r\nsuch laws and customs as were incompatible with it.\r\n\r\n5. To preach in the Synagogues, and to recite the prayers which were\r\noffered up for the Emperor and the Imperial Family.\r\n\r\n6. To solemnize marriages and give divorces.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th February the _Sanhedrin_ met again formally and commenced\r\nits deliberations as to the plan of organization. During the ensuing\r\nMarch the Deputies from Holland, Moses Solomon Asser (1754‒1826),¹\r\nMoses Leman (1785‒1832), the learned Polish Jew, Juda Litvak\r\n(1760‒1836), and the delegates of Frankfort-on-the-Main were admitted\r\ninto the _Sanhedrin_, and declared, in the name of their constituents,\r\nthat they would adhere to the doctrinal decisions of the great\r\n_Sanhedrin_ of France and Italy.² The President answered both\r\ndelegations in _Hebrew_, congratulating them upon their resolutions,\r\nand also the Assembly on having them in its midst, and himself\r\non having to answer coreligionists from a community so highly\r\ndistinguished for its piety, and now governed by a just and liberal\r\nPrince, from whom the friends of humanity had everything to hope\r\nand expect. In brief, he considered himself fortunate in having to\r\ncongratulate the Deputies of a country in which equal participation\r\nin the common rights of men had long since been granted to all the\r\ninhabitants, including the _Israelites_, who were quite as industrious\r\nas the best of the citizens. The President afterwards gave a discourse\r\nin French, which made a most favourable impression on the Assembly,\r\nand offered them the opportunity of expressing their gratitude to\r\nthe great man whom Providence had chosen to be the instrument of its\r\nblessings and its miracles. He expressed the most sanguine hopes as\r\nto the salutary influence which that august Assembly and its labours\r\nwould have upon the future destiny of the Jews. Having expressed\r\nsentiments of lasting devotion to all his colleagues, who had been\r\nconvoked by the voice of this great man, from the Pyrenees to the\r\nborders of the Maine, and from the shores of the Adriatic to the\r\nZuyder Zee, to form a religious Assembly unparalleled in modern\r\nhistory, and having done justice to the talents of the two Assessors,\r\nhe paid, in the name of the _Sanhedrin_, a tribute of homage to\r\nthe Commissaries of the Emperor, _MM._ le Comte Louis Matthieu Molé\r\n(1781‒1855), Etienne Denis, Baron et Duc _de_ Pasquier (1767‒1862), le\r\nComte Joseph Marie Portalis (1778‒1858), and others, whose assiduity,\r\nzeal and indulgence had so powerfully contributed to the success of\r\nthe common cause. _M._ Abraham Furtado (1756‒1816) afterwards proposed\r\na vote of thanks to the Chief of the Grand _Sanhedrin_, which was\r\nadopted with acclamation. _M._ Michael Berr (1780‒1847) then read\r\nthe Procès Verbal, and the President concluded by announcing that the\r\nsittings of the _Sanhedrin_ were closed.³\r\n\r\n    ¹ Great-grandfather of the eminent Dutch Jurist, Tobias\r\n      Michael Carel Asser (1838‒1913).\r\n\r\n    ² _The Times_ reported on the 17th January, 1807, from Warsaw,\r\n      the capital of Poland: “It is stated, that there are no\r\n      less than nine thousand _Jews_ in Warsaw. BUONAPARTE will\r\n      very probably confer on them the privilege of sending their\r\n      Representatives to the Jewish Sanhedrim, at Paris. At all\r\n      events, it is likely that his _Corsican Majesty_ will have\r\n      some business to settle with them. [Baron Alexander _de_]\r\n      Talleyrand (1776‒1839) is going there, and will want\r\n      _beaucoup d’argent_.”\r\n\r\n    ³ Collection des Procès-Verbaux et Décisions du Grand\r\n      Sanhedrin,... Publiée par _M._ Diogène Tama. Paris ... 1807.\r\n      [B. M.]\r\n\r\nSome historians have been inclined to regard the Paris _Sanhedrin_ as\r\na denial of Jewish nationality. This view is wrong, and no conception\r\nof history could be more contrary to the facts. A careful study of the\r\nliterature of that time will show that the _Sanhedrin_ was inspired by\r\ntraditional Jewish ideas. One of the most prominent French Jews, who\r\nwas the first Jew to practise in France as a barrister, _M._ Michael\r\nBerr, had sent a request to all princes and nations “to release the\r\nJews from bondage.” Another member of the _Sanhedrin_, _M._ Lipman\r\nCerf-Berr (1760‒1831), said in his public speech: “Let us forget our\r\norigin! Let us no longer speak of Jews of Alsace, of Portugal, or of\r\nGermany! Though scattered over the face of the earth, we are still\r\n_one people, worshipping the same God_, and as our law commands, we\r\nare to obey the laws of the country in which we live.”¹ This is not\r\nthe language of men who aim at assimilation and the disintegration of\r\ntheir nationality. The ideas of these men are not to be confused with\r\nwhat modern Jewish assimilation preaches. Modern Jewish assimilation\r\ndenies and rejects all Jewish “separatism” except on the religious\r\nside. Consequently, it would not allow the Jew the right to forget\r\nthat he was in Alsace, in Portugal, and so on. According to the\r\nassimilation doctrine, a Jew must be merely an Alsatian, or a\r\nPortuguese, “of the Jewish persuasion.” The purpose of the _Sanhedrin_\r\nwas evidently quite different. The _Sanhedrin_ intended to reconstruct\r\nEuropean Jewry on French imperial lines, with a religious centre in\r\nParis. It therefore examined, with great care and minuteness, those\r\npassages in the Bible and the _Talmud_ which showed that the general\r\nlaws of the Empire were binding on the Jews. On these premises was\r\nbased a declaration of loyalty given by united Jewry, and sanctioned\r\nby the revival of the _Sanhedrin_, an ancient national institution.\r\n\r\n    ¹ Collection des Actes de l’Assemblée des Israélites de France\r\n      et du royaume d’Italie,... Publiée par M. Diogène Tama.\r\n      Paris,... 1807 [B. M.] _pp._: 71, 124, 157, 158.\r\n\r\nFor Napoleon, however, the _Sanhedrin_ had another purpose, connected\r\nwith his imperial ambitions. He hoped that the Jews, living scattered\r\nall over the world, would contribute to the strengthening of his\r\nworld-empire. Two years prior to the edict of 1806‒7 he had conceived\r\nthe idea of utilizing the special talents of his _Hebrew_ subjects\r\nto that end. He had probably discovered that their financial skill\r\nwas unrivalled, that their commercial correspondence and intercourse\r\nthroughout Europe was more speedy and reliable than any other, and\r\nthat the ramifications of their business in various countries gave\r\nthem a great advantage over all their rivals. He intended to make\r\nthem his devoted co-workers in carrying out his universal political\r\nplans, and with that end in view he contemplated granting them many\r\nconcessions. As, however, the political and legal position of the Jews\r\nin France, as well as in other countries, was still insufficiently\r\ndefined, and numberless accusations were directed against their\r\nreligious principles and _Talmudic_ laws, he deemed it necessary to\r\nlay the foundations of a more definite status. As a preliminary step\r\nin this direction he summoned this meeting of the great _Sanhedrin_,\r\nwhich was to consist of the most eminent and learned _Rabbis_ from\r\nevery part of France, as well as from adjacent countries over which\r\nhis influence extended. The purpose for which this convention was\r\navowedly called was to “convert into religious doctrines the answers\r\ngiven by the assembly, and likewise those which may result from a\r\ncontinuance of these sittings.” But these statements admit of various\r\ninterpretations: they may mean a confirmation as well as a reformation\r\nof the old traditional laws. And while confirmation by a _Sanhedrin_\r\nis unnecessary, reformation would appear impossible. The _Sanhedrin_\r\nhad no authority whatever to reform Judaism, and no intention of doing\r\nso. No conservative Jew would accept the _Sanhedrin’s_ opinion in a\r\nmatter of religious tradition, and, on the other hand, “reformed” Jews\r\nwould not be satisfied with its decisions, or, not being bound by any\r\ntradition, would not require _Rabbinical_ decisions at all.\r\n\r\nIn reality the patriotic Declaration of the _Sanhedrin_ was intended\r\nto discredit and demolish the dangerous accusations against the\r\nJewish people and against the teachings of Judaism. It is a mistake\r\nto regard it, as some writers have done, as an indication of a desire\r\nfor the reform of Judaism or for assimilation. The statements of the\r\n_Sanhedrin_ were in accordance with the traditional Jewish Law. Its\r\nsolemn declaration of loyalty and patriotism was not an innovation.\r\nThe fathers and grandfathers of the _Rabbis_ who made this declaration\r\nwere not less faithful and loyal to their Governments and to the\r\ncountries in which they lived than the _Rabbis_ of the _Sanhedrin_.\r\nThe Declaration was practically a new edition of the _Modaa Rabba_\r\nprinted as a preface to every treatise of the _Talmud_. This _Modaa_\r\ndeclares for human solidarity, community of interests with other\r\nnations and loyalty to the Government in the old traditional way;\r\nthe _Sanhedrin_ expresses identical views in modern language, in\r\naccordance with the spirit of the new age and environment. The purport\r\nof both is undoubtedly the same.\r\n\r\n  Illustration: _MEMBERS OF THE PARISIAN SANHEDRIN_\r\n\r\n       ABRAHAM FURTADO         _Rabbi_ ABRAHAM _de_ COLOGNA\r\n\r\n       _Rabbi_ BARUCH GOUGUENHEIM    _Rabbi_ EMMANUEL DEUTZ\r\n\r\n       _Rabbi_ J.

But it remained an episode, because Napoleon’s\r\nattitude towards the Jews was, generally speaking, far from consistent.\r\nAt one time he offered them _Jerusalem_; at another he was inclined\r\nto transport _Jerusalem_ to Paris. Some time before the _Sanhedrin_\r\nassembled, he seemed to be vexed with the Jews――a feeling of a\r\ntemporary character, which was probably the reflex of disappointment\r\nin his far-reaching plans. On other occasions he showed exceptional\r\nkindness to Jewish soldiers and other Jews.¹\r\n\r\n    ¹ See _Napoléon et les soldats juifs, par Petit de Lagare_,\r\n      p. 29.\r\n\r\nAll these facts combined lead to the inference that the Jewish\r\nproblem had often engaged his attention. He seems, like his adherents,\r\nto have wavered as to the acceptance of the idea of the Restoration\r\nof _Israel_ or of that of Assimilation, but finally embraced the\r\ndoctrines of the Sanhedrin, which could be applied easily to the small\r\nJewish population in France. The elimination not only of the Jews of\r\nAsia and Africa, but also of the Jews in other European countries,\r\nfrom the Jewish problem in France, caused by the failure of great\r\nschemes of conquest, necessarily narrowed the scope of the Jewish\r\nproblem and deprived it of its former grandeur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n                  ENGLISH OPINION ON THE _SANHEDRIN_\r\n\r\n    English opinion on the _Sanhedrin_――F.

Diogène Tama――The Prince\r\n    _de_ Ligne.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMING back to English history, we now propose to trace the impression\r\nproduced in this country by Bonaparte’s Palestine Appeal of 1798 and\r\nthe Proclamation of a _Sanhedrin_ in 1807.\r\n\r\nEnglish opinion on this point was quite clear. No objections were\r\never raised to the restoration of the Jewish nation to Palestine: this\r\nidea had been cherished in England for centuries. But English opinion\r\nwas opposed to its becoming a strategic or political instrument in\r\nthe hands of an ambitious conqueror. Moreover, that opinion was not\r\ninclined to separate the idea of the Restoration of _Israel_ from that\r\nof the emancipation of the Jews. Thus the _Sanhedrin_ was considered\r\nmerely a tentative preliminary step towards Restoration, and the\r\nDeclaration made by that body against Jewish national aspirations\r\nproduced an impression of surprise and bewilderment. This Declaration\r\nwas not, in fact, intended to be a denial of Jewish nationality in its\r\nethical, historical, cultural or religious aspect: it was rather an\r\navowal of political loyalty. Yet such a Declaration, expressed as it\r\nwas in exaggerated terms, was calculated to surprise and puzzle the\r\ngenuine friends of the Jews in England, and give rise to\r\nmisunderstanding.\r\n\r\nF. D. Kirwan, the English translator of the _Parisian Sanhedrim_,\r\npublished in French by the French-Jewish editor, M. Diogène Tama\r\n(Appendix xlii), says, in his preface: “... The ultimate views which\r\nBonaparte may have on the Jewish nation are, to this day, involved\r\nin obscurity; while the supposed advantages he so pompously conferred\r\non them may reasonably be called in question. When we consider that\r\nthe Jewish population of France and Italy is not calculated, by the\r\ndeputies themselves, at more than one hundred thousand souls (a small\r\nnumber indeed when compared with the population of those countries),\r\nwe are at a loss to see what great advantages could immediately result\r\nto Bonaparte from the Jews embracing zealously the profession of arms.\r\nWe well know that his gigantic plans of ambition rest on the laws\r\nof conscription; but the Jews are already liable to them; they can\r\nhardly escape their excessive rigour; and even the whole of the Jewish\r\nyouth, of the requisite age, would, in point of number, make but a\r\ncontemptible reinforcement to the immense armies of France.\r\n\r\n“These exhortations to embrace the profession of arms, so zealously\r\nrepeated by the leading members of the French-Jews, are besides,\r\nalways coupled with strong recommendations to follow mechanical trades\r\nand husbandry; in short, those professions without which _a nation\r\ncannot exist by itself_, but which are not more particularly useful\r\nthan any others to a small given number of people, who consider _as\r\ntheir country_ an Empire in which these professions abound.\r\n\r\n“We find these same recommendations strongly inforced in the answer\r\nof M. Furtado to the commercial Jews of Frankfort, who hardly can have\r\na choice of employment. ‘We have,’ says he, ‘too many merchants and\r\nbankers among us, and too few artificers and husbandmen,――and, above\r\nall, too few soldiers’: but if their _countrymen_ thoroughly fill\r\nthese branches of employment, what necessity is there for having\r\nhusbandmen, artificers, and soldiers _of their own_?\r\n\r\n“The Jewish deputies say that Bonaparte conceived the idea of their\r\n_regeneration_, or their _political redemption_, in the land of\r\nEgypt and on the _banks of the Jordan_. This we doubt not; and though\r\nwe are almost ashamed to hazard the extravagant supposition, we\r\nfeel a conviction that his gigantic mind entertains the idea of\r\nre-establishing them in Palestine, and that this forms a part of his\r\nplan respecting Egypt, which he is well known never to have abandoned.\r\n\r\n“No one will contend that this idea is too wild for his conception;\r\nit is, on the contrary, perfectly consonant with his love for\r\nextraordinary, dazzling enterprises; he acts in this even with more\r\nthan his usual foresight, by attempting to prepare the Jews for\r\nthe new situation he intends for them. It is with this view that he\r\nencourages them to follow those professions which are necessary for\r\nmen forming a distinct nation in a land of their own; for certainly,\r\na body wholly composed of merchants and traders could never exist as\r\nsuch....\r\n\r\n“The answer to the sixth question, by which the French Jews\r\nacknowledge France as their country, without any restriction whatever,\r\nis a still more heinous dereliction of the tenets of the Mosaic law;\r\nfor they give up, by it, the hope of the expected Messiah, and of the\r\neverlasting possession of the promised land of Canaan, which they deem\r\na part of the sacred covenant between God and His chosen people.\r\n\r\n“While we thus inculpate the Jewish deputies, it cannot be expected\r\nthat we shall lay too great a stress on the fulsome and frequently\r\nimpious flattery which characterizes all their productions....\r\n\r\n“But flattery is the opiate of the guilty conscience; it sooths the\r\npangs of remorse;...”¹\r\n\r\n    ¹ Transactions of the Parisian _Sanhedrim_ ...

James Bicheno (1751‒1831), of Newbury, an ♦Anabaptist minister\r\nwho attained some distinction in his day through his works on the\r\nProphecies, and of others on various subjects (Appendix xliii).

The author is a great believer in the future of _Israel_\r\nand of Palestine, but he looks upon the problem mainly from a\r\nreligious point of view, though he does not demand any conversion\r\nof Jews prior to their Restoration. Many of his conclusions are\r\nunacceptable, and others are incapable of proof, but even these\r\nare useful in so far as they may “stimulate the minds of rulers to\r\nmeditation, and thus suggest to them new aspects¹ and new ways of\r\ninquiry”; and although there is little thought in his book, and some\r\nof its main themes are not developed with completeness or accuracy,\r\nthe ingenuity which leads to so many suggestions, and the elegance\r\nwhich groups them so artistically, give the book vivacity and\r\ndiversity. The author refers to the _Parisian Sanhedrim_, and accepts\r\nthe view of the English translator, F. D.

But it needs but little discernment, when, besides\r\nall this, the state of things both in Europe and in the East, and the\r\ncharacter of the extraordinary man who has taken this people under his\r\nprotection, are taken into consideration, to perceive, that something\r\nis intended more characteristic of the vast grasp of Napoleon’s\r\nambition than that of squeezing out of the Jews a few millions of\r\nlivres....”\r\n\r\nBicheno concludes thus: “... it must be allowed by all serious minds,\r\n... that the great question relative to the future fortunes of the\r\nJews, who, for so many ages, have been preserved as by a continued\r\nmiracle, possesses considerable interest: . .. that the Jews, after\r\ntheir present long captivity, will be gathered from all nations, and\r\nbe again restored to their own country, and be made a holy and happy\r\npeople. That their restoration will be effected at a time of great and\r\ngeneral calamities.... That it is most likely they will be first put\r\nin motion by some foreign power, and that this power is some maritime\r\none in these western parts of the world.... How long it is to the time\r\nwhen ‘the dry bones of the House of _Israel_’ will begin to move, it\r\nis impossible to say;... But although no one can say how near, or how\r\ndistant, the time may be, when God will fulfil his promises to the\r\nJewish nation; yet it is certain there never were so many reasons for\r\nconcluding it not to be very far off, as at present. We live in awful\r\ntimes. We and our fathers have seen wars, but, since man learnt to\r\nshed blood, there never was one similar to the present, in which the\r\nnations are dashing each other to pieces.... Events the most alarming\r\nfollow each other in quick succession.... Palestine itself is becoming\r\nthe scene of contest; and that ferment, which has been productive of\r\nsuch unexpected and awful catastrophes in Europe, has reached the\r\nshores of Egypt and Syria.”¹\r\n\r\n    ¹ _Ibid._, _pp._ 59‒60: 228‒230.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it may be pointed out that Bonaparte’s idea of the\r\nrestoration of the Jews was not quite new in France. Some suggestions\r\nof the kind had been made in French literature before. Thus the Prince\r\n_de_ Ligne¹ wrote, in his _Memoirs upon the Jews_, in 1797:\r\n\r\n    ¹ Charles Joseph, Prince _de_ Ligne, was born in Brussels,\r\n      1735, and died in Vienna, 1814. He distinguished himself as\r\n      a general during the Seven Years’ War. He was an immensely\r\n      wealthy nobleman and a great traveller, and after the war\r\n      he settled at Vienna, where he was attached to the Imperial\r\n      Court, and became a friend and adviser of the Emperor\r\n      Joseph II. (1765‒1790). He addressed to the Emperor――who\r\n      was much interested in the reformation of the Jews and\r\n      granted them some measure of rights――a “Memorial about the\r\n      Jewish problem,” and suggested a scheme of a return of the\r\n      Jews to Palestine (Œuvres choisis, Paris et Genève, 1809).\r\n\r\n“After having traced to the Christian states their duties and their\r\ninterests in regard to the amelioration of the condition of the Jews\r\nof Europe, we may prophesy what will happen in case they ignore this\r\ncounsel.... If the Turks have a little common sense they will try\r\nand attract the Jews to them in order to make them their political,\r\nmilitary and financial advisers, their police agents, their merchants,\r\nin short to become initiated by their advisers into all wherein lies\r\nthe strength and weakness of the Christian states. Finally, the Sultan\r\nwill sell to them the Kingdom of _Judah_, where they would act better\r\nthan aforetimes.... The Jews who would have found again their country\r\nwould be compelled to make therein flourish the arts, industry,\r\nagriculture and the commerce of Europe. _Jerusalem_, a horrible nest\r\nat present (this was written in 1797), giving a heartache to the\r\npilgrims who come there now, would become a splendid capital. They\r\nwould rebuild the Temple of _Solomon_ upon its ruins. They would fix\r\nthe waters of the torrents of _Kidron_, which would supply canals for\r\ncirculation and exportation.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n                     THE ZIONIST IDEA IN ENGLAND\r\n\r\n    The spirit of the time――Different currents――Thomas Witherby\r\n    ――Dr. Joseph Priestley――Anti-Socinus, _alias_ Anselm Bayly\r\n    ――John Hadley Swain――William Whiston――Bishop Robert Lowth\r\n    ――Dr. Philip Doddridge――David Levi.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN the early years of the nineteenth century religious ideas exercised\r\nconsiderable influence on the English mind, and penetrated deeply\r\ninto the soul of the nation. Public opinion was, therefore, favourably\r\ndisposed towards Zionism, and prepared to accept it from the\r\nreligious point of view. But that was not the only point of view from\r\nwhich Zionism was advocated and accepted. Zionism had two aspects,\r\ncorresponding to the two meanings expressed by the words “Restoration\r\nof _Israel_.” Those words sometimes denoted simply the tendency\r\ntowards a Jewish national revival, an aspiration as elementary and\r\nnatural as any other of the kind; at other times the idea of the\r\n“Restoration of _Israel_” was connected with the realization of\r\nreligious prophecies, and it was held that Judaism or Christianity\r\n(according to the point of view) was to be glorified by the\r\nresettlement of Jews in Palestine. As religion, and especially\r\nthe Bible, was one of the most potent agencies in the formation\r\nof political and moral theories in England, it came about that the\r\nhistory of the Zionist idea was interwoven with that of religious\r\nopinions. But, on the other hand, it is impossible to overlook the\r\ninfluence of nationalist ideas which supported the Zionist cause\r\nfrom another point of view, and were expressed in a different tone\r\nand spirit. While on the one hand religious imagination gave to\r\nthe conception the richness and warmth that belong to sentiment,\r\n♦statesmanship contributed the clearness and firmness that reason\r\nalone can give.\r\n\r\n    ♦ “statemanship” replaced with “statesmanship”\r\n\r\nEvery keen student of the literature of that epoch concerning\r\nZionism will readily notice that there were two different currents of\r\nthought. We will refer only to one writer who was altogether averse\r\nto conversionism, yet adopted the Zionist view――Thomas Witherby\r\n(1760‒1820). He was a London solicitor of repute, who after his\r\nretirement lived at Enfield and took up the study of political and\r\nsocial problems. He wrote _An Attempt to Remove Prejudices Concerning\r\nthe Jewish Nation_ (Appendix xlv), and was opposed on some important\r\npoints to Mr. Bicheno’s prophecies (Appendix xlvi), but, essentially,\r\nshared the latter’s opinions concerning the rights of the Jewish\r\nnation. He was the first English author who dealt with the imaginary\r\nincompatibility of Jewish citizenship with Jewish national claims to\r\nPalestine. He confessed that prejudices against the Jews, though not\r\nas vigorous then as they had been in times gone by, were still very\r\nstrong. He admitted “the sad conduct of Christians against Jews”;\r\nhe praised “the Jewish sincerity and their attachment _to their\r\nnationality_ and religion,” and on those grounds he defended the claim\r\nof the Jews’ citizenship. “Bad Jews would be bad citizens; good Jews\r\nwould be good citizens.” According to his view, the just demand for\r\nequality of rights for the Jews does not conflict with the claim of\r\nthe Jewish nation to a land of its own, in which he decidedly believed.\r\nWe may let him speak for himself:\r\n\r\n“Previous to the great and most conspicuous return of the Jews to\r\ntheir own land there will be a partial restoration of many of them to\r\ntheir land, which will probably be effected by the Protestant powers\r\nwho may renounce their prejudices against them, and see that the\r\nnon-acceptance of the Christian doctrines is not the bar to their\r\nrestoration to the favour of God.”\r\n\r\nHe recognized both the right of the Jews to decide for themselves in\r\nmatters affecting the preservation of the race, and the independent\r\nvalidity of the considerations which lead to the recognition of Jewish\r\nrights in all countries. It was his opinion that while humanity and\r\njustice must refuse to recognize anything in the laws of any country\r\nwhich was at variance with the principle of equality, they should be\r\nthe more ready to admit the higher claim of the Jewish nation to a\r\nhome of its own.\r\n\r\nWitherby stood, then, for the Restoration of _Israel_ as well as for\r\nJewish Emancipation. There can be no stronger and more convincing\r\nprotest against the fallacious assumption of the irreconcilability of\r\nZionism and Emancipation than Witherby’s interesting and instructive\r\npamphlet. His ideal――a noble and statesmanlike ideal――was to do\r\njustice to those Jews who lived in the country, and accordingly formed\r\nan integral part of the organism of the State, working like others\r\nfor the prosperity and safety of the realm. Equally he considered\r\nit a sacred duty of humanity to enable this ancient and disinherited\r\nnation to rebuild a central home for those of its members who saw the\r\nnecessity of such a home, and had the inclination to go there. The\r\npolicy of the State towards the Jews was to be based on these broad\r\nprinciples. Witherby was a man of practical sense and clear sight; he\r\nstated clearly and forcibly the anomalies of the Jewish position, and,\r\nunhampered by petty prejudices, sought earnestly for a solution of the\r\nJewish problem in its entirety.\r\n\r\n  Illustration:\r\n          _Rev._ JAMES BICHENO                    DAVID LEVI\r\n\r\n                        _Rev._ WILLIAM WHISTON\r\n\r\n          _Dr._ JOSEPH PRIESTLEY      _President_ JOHN ADAMS\r\n\r\nIn concluding this part of the review of the Zionist idea in Christian\r\nEngland, we may mention the name of Dr. Joseph Priestley (1733‒1804).\r\nDr. Priestley was an eminent English philosopher, theologian, and\r\nchemist. Though not a conversionist in the true sense of the term,\r\nhe was nevertheless somewhat influenced by that point of view. He was\r\nassisted by the Rev. Anselm Bayly (1719‒1794), LL.D., Sub-Dean of His\r\nMajesty’s chapels, _alias_ Anti-Socinus, and John Hadley Swain. In\r\nhis _Letters to the Jews_ (Appendix xlvii) and in _A Comparison of the\r\nInstitutions of Moses ... And An Address to the Jews on the present\r\nstate of the World_ (Appendix xlviii) he threw his arguments into a\r\nseries of hypothetical syllogisms, the only defect in which is that\r\nhis premises could hardly be proved. Yet the stress which he laid\r\non the acknowledgment of _Israel’s_ dignity atones for the sophistry\r\nof the argument. Having cast a good idea in the stereotyped mould of\r\nconversionism, he seems to have expected that a great impression would\r\nbe produced upon the Jews; but, naturally, his conversionist methods\r\nevoked a storm of protest.\r\n\r\nHe found a strong opponent in David Levi (1742‒1808), a _Hebraist_ and\r\nwell-known author of books dealing with Jewish theology and ritual.\r\nIn his controversies with believers and non-believers David Levi\r\nattempted to show that the divine mission of the prophets was fully\r\nestablished by the present dispersion of the Jews. He published a\r\nreply――_Letters to Dr. Priestley, in answer to those he addressed\r\nto the Jews_; London, 1787 (Appendix xlix)――in which the orthodox\r\nstandpoint of passive, religious Zionism is defined in the following\r\nterms: “And, as all the calamities that were to befall our nation,\r\nin consequence of our transgressing the Law, as foretold by that\r\ngreat prophet, and divine legislator, _Moses_, have been fulfilled in\r\nall respects; consequently, those great and glorious promises, also\r\nforetold by the same prophet, must likewise have their full completion.\r\n\r\n“But the exact time of this accomplishment is not known to any, save\r\nthe eternal God Himself;... These prophecies, Sir, are our consolation\r\nin this long, and dreadful captivity, and have been our support,\r\nin enabling us to bear up against the many grievous and miserable\r\npersecutions, we have suffered....” (_pp._ 2‒3). In this way Levi\r\nwithdraws Messianism altogether from human experience and the\r\noperation of the ordinary laws of thought.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, William Whiston (1667‒1752),¹ Bishop Robert Lowth\r\n(1710‒1787)² and Dr. Philip Doddridge (1702‒1751),³ supported the idea\r\nof a speedy restoration of the Jews, and, with the exception of the\r\nliberal-minded Whiston, adopted the conversionist view. There was,\r\nunfortunately, too much hasty and captious objection on the one hand,\r\nand of settled and inveterate prejudice on the other; too strong a\r\ntendency to lose sight of the broader features of the main question\r\nin the eagerness to single out particularly salient points of attack.\r\nNevertheless, the steady progress of the Zionist idea is unmistakable\r\non both sides of the controversy. Regardless of all these polemical\r\ndiscussions, public opinion began to understand that Zionism was not\r\nopposed to and did not interfere with the Christian Millennium or the\r\nJewish _Messiah_, but was simply a definite conception of the way in\r\nwhich humanity has to prepare for the realization of the great ideal.\r\n\r\n    ¹ The Literal Accomplishment of Scripture Prophecies.....\r\n      IV.

John Scott――Mr.\r\n    Joseph Eyre.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT that time the ideal aspirations of the Jewish nation found their\r\nmost forceful expression in English poetry. George Gordon Byron\r\n(1788‒1824), the sixth Baron Byron, who was conversant with every\r\nphase of human life, and touched every string of the divine lyre from\r\nits faintest to its most powerful and heart-stirring tones, rivals\r\nMilton, in his own sphere, in his noble and powerful Biblical drama\r\n_Cain_. He was one of the greatest of English poets, and his genius,\r\nlike that of Milton, was penetrated with the aspirations of the\r\nBible.¹ Byron had seen much in his Eastern wanderings, and by his\r\n_Hebrew Melodies_ had constituted himself in some sort the laureate\r\nof Disraeli’s own race.² There is in his work an intensity of grief\r\nand yearning, a vigour of thought combined with enchanting beauty of\r\nimagination, a tenderness which make him comparable only to the sweet\r\n_Hebrew_ Muse of _Jehudah Halevi_. Zionist poetry owes more to Byron\r\nthan to any other Gentile poet. His _Hebrew Melodies_, which are among\r\nthe most beautiful of his productions, have been translated several\r\ntimes into _Hebrew_, and there are no lines more popular and more\r\noften quoted than:\r\n\r\n    The wild dove hath her nest, the fox his cave,\r\n    Mankind their country, Israel but the grave.\r\n\r\nwhich might well have been a Zionist motto. Byron was a poet and a\r\nhero; the keynote of his character is to be found in the word “revolt.”\r\nWhenever the cause of liberty was in danger, his entire being was\r\nroused to indignation; this was the passion of his soul, and for this\r\nhe gave his life. This “Pilgrim of Eternity,”³ who died a martyr to\r\nhis zeal in the cause of the freedom of Greece, might perhaps have\r\nbeen equally able to sacrifice his life for the freedom of Judæa,\r\nhad the deliverance of Judæa offered scope for a similar struggle in\r\nhis time. As it was he expressed the Jewish tragedy, not only in its\r\npoetical but also in its political aspect.\r\n\r\n    ¹ “The Pilgrim Poet: Lord Byron of Newstead.” By Albert\r\n      Brecknock ... Illustrated ... London ... 1911, _p._ 61.\r\n      “Old Nanny” often spoke of the reverence and love Lord\r\n      Byron had for his Bible, and states that in his quieter\r\n      moments he could often be seen reading it. The verse Byron\r\n      wrote on the fly-leaf of his Bible was taught to William\r\n      Smith when quite a boy, by his mother. It runs as follows:――\r\n\r\n          Within this sacred volume lies\r\n          The mystery of all mysteries.\r\n          Oh! happy he of human race\r\n          To whom our God hath given grace――\r\n          To read, to learn, to watch, to pray,\r\n          To lift the latch, to force the way.\r\n          But better he had ne’er been born\r\n          Who reads to doubt, who reads to scorn.\r\n\r\n    ² _Shelley_ (1792‒1822) _and Lord Beaconsfield_, by Richard\r\n      Garnett (1835‒1906).

Stanza xxx.,\r\n      line 3.\r\n\r\nThe genius of pure imagination is usually apt to evade the actual\r\nfacts of political and social life, and to wing its way into an ideal\r\nworld of abstractions. But some there are who derive their material\r\nfrom the realities of social and national life, and transmute into\r\npoetry the prevailing ideas of the actual world. The Pilgrim Poet\r\nbelonged to the latter category. He re-echoed the aspirations of his\r\ntime. Thorough understanding of and sincere compassion for the sorrows\r\nof _Israel_ found eloquent expression in the English writings of\r\nthat epoch. At that time English writers were keen students of Jewish\r\nhistory, and since the time of Vespasian (9‒79) Jewish history has\r\nrecorded only sorrowful scenes: it tells mainly of fugitives banished\r\nto all quarters of the world, where they have sought asylum and have\r\nbeen compelled to realize the unanimity of the desire to annihilate\r\nthem. “The Jews were a prey to innumerable calamities, and their\r\nexistence was little else than a protracted agony.” “The numberless\r\nbanishments, oppressions, exactions, persecutions, massacres and\r\nmiseries of all kinds, which they have undergone in almost every age\r\nand nation from their first dispersion down to these latter times――the\r\nvarious causes which have concurred to wipe off the very name and\r\nmemorial of them from the face of the earth ... are indescribable.”\r\nThis was what Byron read in the English literature of his time, and\r\nwhat he realized in his wanderings. A homeless nation――that was the\r\nfact which impressed itself most forcibly upon his mind.\r\n\r\nByron’s _Hebrew Melodies_, which were written at the suggestion of the\r\nHonourable Douglas James William Kinnaird (1788‒1830),¹ were published\r\nwith music in January, 1815. Kinnaird was a man of considerable\r\nability and great intellectual attainments. He introduced a Jewish\r\ncomposer, Isaac Nathan (1791‒1864), to Lord Byron about 1812. This\r\nwas the beginning of a friendship which ended only with the death of\r\nthe poet. Byron wrote the _Hebrew Melodies_ with the express purpose\r\nof their being set to music by Nathan, who subsequently bought the\r\ncopyright of the work. Nathan decided to raise the means for the\r\npublication of the _Melodies_ by subscription, and with that object\r\nassociated himself with his co-religionist, the melodious tenor John\r\nBraham (1774?‒1856), who began his musical career as a chorister at\r\nthe Synagogue in Duke’s Place. Braham composed several operas, one\r\nof them the _Americans_, containing that famous song, _The Death of\r\nNelson_; and achieved a European reputation in his time. On signing\r\nthe subscription list, Braham intimated his desire to assist in the\r\npublication of the _Melodies_ and to sing them in public. Hence on the\r\ntitle-page of the first edition, which was published in 1815, it was\r\nrecorded that the music was newly arranged, harmonized and revised by\r\nI. Nathan and I. Braham.\r\n\r\n    ¹ Fifth son of George (_ob._ 1805), seventh Baron Kinnaird of\r\n      Inchture.\r\n\r\nThe _Melodies_ consisted mainly of a selection of favourite airs\r\nsung in connection with the observance of Jewish religious ceremonies\r\n(Appendix l). It is interesting to observe that the music was reviewed\r\nfirst. Some of the remarks respecting Hebrew music are worthy of note.\r\n“In our very limited Review, it cannot be expected that we should\r\nattempt to throw any new light on the dark subject of Hebrew musick....\r\nWhether the present Melodies were ever performed by King David’s 4000\r\nLevites, ... we shall not venture to decide: their age and originality\r\nare left entirely to conjecture, having been ‘preserved by memory\r\nand tradition alone.’ Some of them possess an interesting wildness of\r\ncharacter, which leaves no doubt as to their real antiquity; and the\r\nEditors assure us that they have preserved as much of this feature as\r\nthe rhythm of written musick and the adaptation of the words, would\r\npermit.”¹ The Literary Review of the same Magazine devotes a very few\r\nlines to a criticism of the poems: “To say that these _Melodies_ are\r\nLord Byron’s, is to pronounce them elegant. We select the following\r\nPoem, in addition to that already given in Part I., _p._ 450” (_i.e._\r\n“I saw thee weep”). There follows the poem “Saul.”²\r\n\r\n    ¹ _Gentleman’s Magazine_, June, 1815, _p._ 539.\r\n\r\n    ² _Ibid._, August, _p._ 141.\r\n\r\nMore light is thrown on the subject of Byron’s attitude to the\r\nJewish people and the Zionist idea in Nathan’s _Fugitive Pieces and\r\nReminiscences of Lord Byron_ (Appendix li). In a note (_p._ 24) to\r\n“Oh! Weep for those,” Nathan writes: “Throughout the composition of\r\nthese melodies, it will be observed by the attentive reader that Lord\r\nByron has exhibited a peculiar feeling of commiseration towards the\r\nJews. He was entirely free from the prevalent prejudices against that\r\nunhappy and oppressed race of men. On this subject, he has frequently\r\nremarked, that he deemed the existence of the Jews, as a distinct\r\nrace of men, the most wonderful instance of the ill-effects of\r\npersecution....” That a period of 1800 years should have elapsed, and\r\nthat these people should still preserve their own religion, their laws,\r\nand their customs, in defiance of ecclesiastical and civil oppression,\r\ndoes indeed seem astonishing; but less so, when the effect of his\r\nLordship’s observation is sufficiently understood. On one occasion\r\nhe remarked, “unfortunate men, surrounded by enemies among whom they\r\nare compelled to live; oppressed, scorned, and outcast: condemned\r\nas criminal, because they cannot succumb to their oppressors,...” In\r\nanother note (_p._ 61) contributed to the poem, “From the last hill\r\nthat looks on thy once holy dome.” _On the day of the Destruction of\r\nJerusalem by Titus_, Nathan says: “In the composition of the foregoing\r\nstanzas, he professed to me, that he had always considered the fall\r\nof Jerusalem, as the most remarkable event of all history; for (in his\r\nown words), ‘who can behold the entire destruction of that mighty pile;\r\nthe desolate wanderings of its inhabitants, and compare these positive\r\noccurrences with the distant prophecies which foreran them, and be an\r\ninfidel?’”\r\n\r\nThe authenticity of Nathan’s co-operation is beyond question. Nathan\r\nwas a composer of acknowledged ability, and a writer on various\r\nsubjects. He was born at Canterbury, Kent, and early in life was\r\nsent to Cambridge to study Hebrew and the classical languages. Lady\r\nCaroline Lamb (1785‒1828) was among Nathan’s friends, and wrote poetry\r\nfor him to set to music. Sir Walter Scott (1771‒1832), was also an\r\nadmirer of Nathan’s Jewish musical productions.\r\n\r\nEnthusiasm for the revival of _Hebrew_ music was characteristic\r\nof the time, and was partly due to the prevailing sympathy for the\r\nJewish people, for their sufferings and their hopes (Appendix lii).\r\nIf _Hebrew Melodies_ were written at the suggestion of Kinnaird, this\r\nmust not be taken to mean that poems like _Hebrew Melodies_ can be\r\nwritten merely in response to the suggestion of a personal friend:\r\nthey must be the product of a certain aspiration.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the idea of the Restoration of _Israel_ made\r\nconsiderable headway in other quarters. Rev. Dr. John Gill (1697‒1771)\r\nremarks that “the Protestant Princes will be assisting the Jews in\r\nreplacing them in their own land.”¹ Rev. Dr. Henry Hunter (1741‒1802)\r\nsays: “It is indeed now pretty generally agreed among the learned,\r\nthat we are warranted by the Scriptures to expect ... their return\r\nto their own land;...”²\r\n\r\n    ¹ A Body of Doctrinal Divinity;...

(1773‒1854)\r\nwork on that subject, and also to _The Sacred Calendar of Prophecy_,\r\n1828. The reasons ... are ... satisfactory and convincing. Even if\r\nthere were no other passage to prove it, the one where God declares\r\nthat it shall in future times be said ‘The Lord liveth, who brought up\r\nand who led the children of Israel out of the north country, and from\r\nall the countries whither I had driven them, and they shall dwell in\r\ntheir own land,’ would, I think, be sufficient to prove it; because\r\nit seems too minute and circumstantial to admit of a merely figurative\r\ninterpretation; and, indeed, what can it be a figure of? What is the\r\nreality which the figure is supposed to represent? I would ask, if\r\na prophecy were intended to declare a literal restoration, what more\r\nplain and forcible terms could have been made use of? We should never\r\nresort to figures except where the nature of the subject, or common\r\nsense, imperatively requires it.”¹\r\n\r\n    ¹ Christian Observer, 1838, _p._ 443.\r\n\r\n      To this period belong the following articles on the\r\n      Restoration of the Jews in _The Christian Observer_ (Church\r\n      of England):\r\n\r\n          1838 May, _pp._ 286‒7\r\n          1838 July, _p._ 443\r\n          1838 August, _pp._ 518‒520\r\n          1838 September, _pp._ 554‒556\r\n          1838 November, _pp._ 665‒670\r\n          1841 January, _pp._ 2‒4\r\n          1841 May, _pp._ 271‒273\r\n\r\n“Paulinus” taking the opposite view, says: “In some circles a writer\r\nis almost unchristianized if he does not follow the opinion therein\r\ncurrent ... the literal restoration of the Jews to Palestine; in\r\nfavour of which there is a much more general concurrence of opinion\r\nthan in any other of the particulars.”¹\r\n\r\n    ¹ _Ibid._, 1838, _p._ 286.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n                        THE PALMERSTON PERIOD\r\n\r\n    The Conflict between Turkey and Egypt――Mahmud II., _Sultan_ of\r\n    Turkey――Mehemet Ali, Pasha of Egypt――The victory of Nezib――The\r\n    Turkish Fleet――Wellington’s policy――The Eastern Question\r\n    ――Wellington’s opinion――The London Conference, 1840――The\r\n    Insurrection in Syria and the Lebanon――An Ultimatum――The\r\n    Capture of Acre by the British Fleet, 1840――Schemes of\r\n    annexation.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE Palmerston period, 1837‒52, was a great time in England for the\r\nidea of the Restoration of _Israel_. It was a time of stirring events\r\nin the East, events which raised some of the most momentous problems\r\nthat can engage the statesman’s mind. The English people watched from\r\nday to day with the deepest interest the progress of annexations, of\r\nconquest, of negotiations, which they believed would go far to decide\r\nthe future development and destinies of the greatest nations of the\r\nworld. The European horizon was so disturbed that a great political\r\nauthority of the day is said to have declared that “if an angel from\r\nheaven were in the Foreign Office he would not preserve peace for\r\nthree months.”\r\n\r\nThe facts are sufficiently familiar to most readers. But it will be\r\nnecessary for our purpose to go over the oft-trodden ground, which\r\nmust be done rapidly.\r\n\r\nIn 1839 a tremendous crisis broke out between Turkey and Egypt as the\r\nresult of a series of conflicts and struggles. In the brief space of\r\neight years (1831‒39) Mehemet Ali (1769‒1849) had contrived to overrun\r\nthe whole of Syria, having organized a fleet and an army beyond the\r\nlegitimate necessities of his government, by acts of tyranny and\r\noppression against the very people for whose defence he pretended\r\nto have raised them; and he forced these wretched people, whom he\r\nwas bound to protect, to join him in rebellion, thus fastening more\r\nfirmly the chains with which he had shackled them. Having concentrated\r\n100,000 men on the Turkish frontier, he at once threw off the mask\r\nand intimated to the European consuls his intention of declaring his\r\nindependence unless his demand for the government of Syria for life\r\nand of Egypt _en hérédité_ were conceded.\r\n\r\nHe struck the first blow, and was very successful during the first\r\nstage of the war. The victory of Nezib (24 June, 1839) was the last of\r\nhis triumphs. The new army, which he had taken pains to organize, was\r\nonly half trained. Still his power was unshaken, and his advantage was\r\nnot confined to the land. The Turkish admiral, beaten by Mehemet Ali,\r\nand fearing for his life if he returned to Constantinople, determined\r\non an act of treachery, which would ingratiate him with the victorious\r\nruler of Egypt. He took the Turkish fleet, with some 20,000 men aboard,\r\nto Alexandria, and surrendered it to Mehemet Ali.\r\n\r\nThe surprise and astonishment which the suddenness of these\r\noccurrences caused did not allow English diplomacy much time to\r\nconsider. It was necessary to intervene at once, unless the Ottoman\r\nEmpire was to be broken up. Palmerston determined to carry out\r\nWellington’s (1769‒1852) policy, and to reduce the apparently\r\ninvincible Pasha to “a state of obedience and subordination to the\r\n_Sultan_” (1808‒1839), Mahmud II. (1785‒1839). The difficulties seemed\r\nformidable, but Palmerston’s conception of the diplomatic situation\r\nwas unerring. He scouted the idea of actual intervention on Egyptian\r\nsoil. The lessons of the battle of the Nile and of the earlier siege\r\nof Acre had not been thrown away upon a survivor of the struggle with\r\nNapoleon Bonaparte. A different strategic plan was adopted: a British\r\nsquadron was to compel the evacuation of Syria by Mehemet Ali.\r\n\r\nThe imminent perils and dangers which surrounded this undertaking\r\nfrom the political point of view were evident. A great international\r\nproblem arose. The solution of those important and complex problems\r\nwhich include what is usually called the “Eastern Question” had long\r\noccupied a considerable place in the field of international politics,\r\nespecially in England. There was scarcely one, perhaps, of the more\r\neminent English diplomatists who had not distinguished himself in this\r\ndepartment in a greater or a less degree; and there was scarcely an\r\naspirant to foreign political activity and distinction who had not\r\nthought it one of the surest paths to his ambition to come forward\r\nas a champion in this arena. It must, however, be borne in mind that\r\nthis question was continually taking on a new form, and accordingly\r\nopinions and interests were always changing. In 1839‒40 controversy\r\nabout this question attained its greatest intensity, and the\r\ninterested powers were in a position of the darkest perplexity.¹\r\n\r\n    ¹ Wellington wrote in 1829 to the Earl of Aberdeen: (1784‒1860)\r\n      “... it cannot be doubted that the measures completed\r\n      by this Treaty of Peace must encourage other nations of\r\n      Christians to endeavour to attain the same advantages by\r\n      similar means. The other Powers of Europe and all parties\r\n      in Europe must view the Treaty of Peace in the same light\r\n      as we do ... they must all consider it in the same light\r\n      as the death-blow to the independence of the Ottoman Porte,\r\n      and the forerunner of the dissolution and extinction of\r\n      its power” (_The Eastern Question: Extracted from the\r\n      Correspondence of the late Duke of Wellington_, London,\r\n      1877, _p._ 40).\r\n\r\nAfter the traitorous defection of the Turkish fleet to the side of\r\nMehemet Ali, five great Powers of Europe officially intimated to the\r\nPorte that they had determined to discuss and settle together the\r\nembarrassing Eastern question, and ultimately a Conference was called\r\ntogether in London, at which the Ambassadors of these Powers were to\r\nmeet with full authority from their Governments to bring the matter to\r\na definite issue. It appeared throughout that France was favourable to\r\nMehemet Ali’s ambitious projects, whilst England had decided to compel\r\nhim to evacuate Syria forthwith and to restore the fleet before it\r\nwould entertain any proposition of his to be allowed to retain Egypt\r\nin hereditary possession, or any part of Syria during his lifetime.\r\nThe negotiations in London dragged on slowly; month after month passed\r\nby, and the high contracting parties came to no definite decision.\r\nEverybody in England was anxious that Great Britain should play an\r\nimportant rôle in the Eastern Question. The state of the East had\r\nbecome utterly corrupt and hopeless. Great Britain considered that it\r\nwas in its interest to maintain the integrity of the Ottoman Empire.\r\nWhat was meant by this principle? Great Britain as an Asiatic not\r\nless than a European Power was interested to see that the Ottoman\r\nEmpire was made thoroughly independent and enabled to progress by\r\nconsolidating and developing its provinces. As to Syria, everybody in\r\nEngland was aware that its possession was essential for the security\r\nof the richest and most important provinces of Asiatic Turkey, to\r\nwhich it was the military key. This was sufficiently demonstrated by\r\nthe events which actually took place.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th May, 1840, an insurrection of an alarming character broke\r\nout in Syria and _The Lebanon_ among the Druses and Christians against\r\nthe Emir and the Egyptian Government. On the 15th of July, 1840, an\r\nevent occurred which brought the affairs of the Levant to a crisis.\r\nA convention was signed in London between England, Russia, Austria\r\nand Prussia, without the concurrence of France, whereby an ultimatum\r\nwas delivered to Mehemet Ali, calling on him to evacuate Palestine.\r\nThe four Powers demanded of him, first, a prompt submission to the\r\n_Sultan_ (1839‒1861) Abdul Medjid (1823‒1861) as his Sovereign;\r\nsecondly, the immediate restoration of the Turkish fleet; thirdly,\r\na prompt evacuation of Syria, Adana, Candia, Arabia, and the Holy\r\nCities. Moreover the four Powers declared the ports of Syria and Egypt\r\nto be in a state of blockade. Consequently Acre, the fortress which\r\nhad been the great depot and arsenal of Mehemet Ali, and which in\r\n1799 had withstood Bonaparte after the twelfth assault, when he had\r\nbeen defeated by Admiral Sir William Sidney Smith (1764‒1840) with a\r\nfew sailors and marines and a force of undisciplined Turks, was now\r\nsuccessfully bombarded by the English Admiral, Sir Robert Stopford\r\n(1768‒1847), and placed in possession of the _Sultan’s_ troops. The\r\nfortress, which was considered invulnerable, surrendered on the 3rd of\r\nNovember, 1840. _Jaffa_ surrendered to the new garrison of Acre, a few\r\ndays after the fall of the fortress. On the 3rd of November the happy\r\ntidings of the fall of Acre were brought to Constantinople, and the\r\nGovernment issued orders for public rejoicings; on the 19th of that\r\nmonth the Turkish Governor was officially informed that the garrison\r\nand inhabitants of _Jerusalem_ had given allegiance to the Porte.\r\n\r\nThe question of the future of Palestine now arose. Was Palestine\r\nsimply to be left to Turkey or was Great Britain to secure some\r\nimportant places? The prevalent tendency in English opinion was in\r\nfavour of the annexation of Acre and Cyprus. Acre, in the hands of\r\nEngland, or of any other nation commanding the sea, could be made\r\nreally impregnable, and Cyprus seemed also to be of great strategic\r\nimportance, especially to England. The reasons for such an annexation\r\nwere palpable. England and her Allies had not merely rescued Syria,\r\nthey had absolutely saved the whole Ottoman Empire. After the battle\r\nof Nezib had given the defiles of Mount Taurus to Mehemet Ali, nothing\r\ncould have obstructed the rebels’ triumphant march to Constantinople.\r\nThe Allies had thus rendered to the Ottoman Empire the greatest\r\npossible service that one State can receive from another. Gratitude\r\nalone might have suggested a more valuable acknowledgment of this\r\nservice than Acre and Cyprus; but as the service had been rendered at\r\nsome risk, and at enormous expense, justice demanded that it should\r\nbe paid for; and nobody could suggest that it would be paid for too\r\ndearly by a strip of territory which was of little value to Turkey,\r\nthough useful to England, and which in British hands would assuredly\r\nsupply the Porte with a fortress that could never be established\r\nin its own territory. Acre and Cyprus garrisoned by British troops\r\nwould give Turkey the surest protection. Attention was also called to\r\nthe fact that no spot in the world was associated with so many proud\r\nrecollections as Acre, the theatre of British gallantry from the\r\ndays of Richard _Cœur de Lion_ (1157‒1199) to those of Admiral Sir W.\r\nSidney Smith and Admiral Sir Robert Stopford. Another consideration\r\nhad great weight with English opinion. The possession of Acre would\r\nopen a road for the return of Biblical truth to the land from which\r\nthat truth had spread to the human race; and Englishmen would feel\r\nguilty of sin if they failed to impress upon their Government the need\r\nof seizing this glorious and blessed opportunity. To take, however,\r\nthe more utilitarian view of the matter, Great Britain, occupying\r\nthe impregnable position of Acre, would not be under the necessity\r\nof seeking the freedom of the overland route to India from any other\r\nPower. She would command it at all times. Acre in the hands of Great\r\nBritain would be a perfect guarantee against revolts in Egypt or in\r\nSyria, and would in fact ensure the Turkish Empire against the only\r\ndanger that could threaten it on the side of Asia.\r\n\r\nThe effects of an English settlement in Syria on the general interests\r\nof mankind presented a more serious question. Syria and the adjacent\r\ncountries were in a worse state than they had been 2000 years ago.\r\nWhile the deserts of America and Australasia had been regained for the\r\nuse of man, while India had been brought to peace and unity and its\r\nworst superstitions had been modified, if not altogether extirpated,\r\nby the influence of European civilization, man had given place to the\r\nsavage creatures of the wilderness in those countries from which all\r\nthat he knows of good, was originally derived. An English settlement\r\nin Syria would begin the work of regeneration in the most venerable\r\nand interesting country in the world. England would be to Syria and to\r\nthe adjacent countries all that she had been to India――the protector\r\nof the weak, the common arbiter, the universal peacemaker. Her laws\r\nand her liberties enable her to fulfil that function, her commercial\r\ninterests fit her to undertake it, while her wealth, her naval\r\nsupremacy and her colonial power furnish her with the means required\r\nfor the purpose. Why should any other power oppose her acquiring that\r\nregion? That its acquisition would add to her commercial resources\r\nand to her defensive strength had to be conceded. But had no nation\r\never before sought to increase her commercial resources and add to\r\nher defensive strength by means in themselves legitimate, which would\r\nnot in any way infringe upon the rights or interests of others? The\r\nadvancement of the world in civilization and happiness must remain\r\nfor ever at a standstill, if each nation is to be held in check by\r\nthe jealousy of the others. This was the attitude of public opinion on\r\nthis question from the point of view of human progress and of British\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n                          THE SYRIAN PROBLEM\r\n\r\n    The conflicting interests of the Powers――Was the conflict\r\n    irreconcilable?――Public opinion――A new principle――The\r\n    independence of Syria――A neutral position――The Zionist idea\r\n    as the only solution――A practical proposition.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLIC opinion had for a long time laboured under the impression\r\nthat the intricacy of the Eastern question was due much more to the\r\nconflicting interests of the Powers engaged in its solution than to\r\nany insurmountable barrier between them and the _Sultans_ Mahmud II.,\r\nAbdul Medjid and Mehemet Ali. With France and Mehemet Ali on the\r\none side and the four European Powers on the other, it was evident\r\nthat war would have the most disastrous effect on the contending\r\nparties. The question arose whether the interests of the parties\r\nwere irreconcilable, and whether it was not possible to devise an\r\narrangement acceptable to both sides and thus to avert war. Some\r\npolitical leaders thought that they could settle the question, and\r\nthat it would be possible to adopt a policy sufficiently far-reaching\r\nand just to satisfy the expectations of the five Powers.\r\n\r\nIt was common knowledge that the great dilemma in which Turkey and\r\nEgypt found themselves had throughout hinged on the question of\r\nSyria. Without the possession of Syria the power of Mehemet Ali became\r\ninsecure; with it he would be in a very strong position, because\r\nTurkey could only exist by his sufferance. In fact, the possession\r\nof Syria would give a tremendous advantage to either side.\r\n\r\nThe problem was therefore to enable each of the Governments to prevent\r\nSyria from passing into the hands of the enemy. And there was only\r\none possible solution――namely, the establishment of an independent\r\nstate in Syria. The grounds for this conclusion may be stated in the\r\nfollowing series of propositions:\r\n\r\n    (1) That the _Sultan_, unassisted, was powerless to retain\r\n        Syria.\r\n\r\n    (2) That Egypt had no right to Syria, except in so far\r\n        as lawlessness and violence might make its possession\r\n        necessary.\r\n\r\n    (3) That Egypt had a right to independence, if she could\r\n        achieve it.\r\n\r\n    (4) That if Syria remained part of Turkey, the independence of\r\n        Egypt would be constantly menaced.\r\n\r\n    (5) That if Syria remained part of Egypt, the existence of\r\n        Turkey would be rendered insecure.\r\n\r\n    (6) That the insecure position of Turkey would endanger the\r\n        peace of Europe.\r\n\r\n    (7) That Syria, being a conquered kingdom, had the right to\r\n        regain her independence if she could.\r\n\r\n    (8) That by the existence of Syria as an independent state\r\n        both Turkey and Egypt would remain intact.\r\n\r\n    (9) That the neutral position of the new state would keep\r\n        both Turkey and Egypt in check, and prevent either from\r\n        becoming too powerful.\r\n\r\nMehemet Ali could not object to a solution on these lines. He would\r\nbe protected by the _Sultan_, Abdul Medjid, and would be at liberty\r\nto extend his influence in other directions. But the _Sultan_,\r\nhaving been paramount lord of Syria, might reasonably claim some\r\nconsideration for consenting to the independence of Syria. Who was\r\nto pay this consideration?\r\n\r\nIt is at this point that we have to turn to the old idea of Zionism to\r\nfind the only just and natural solution. Bishop Newton’s commentaries,\r\nWitherby’s moralisings, Byron’s poetry――to these lines of approach\r\nto Zionism was now added the tendency of British politics. A hundred\r\ntimes the promoters of the Zionist idea had been disheartened, a\r\nhundred times they had taken it up again. Now political developments\r\noffered the background for a new propaganda for Zionism. The\r\nRestoration of _Israel_, an idea dear not only to the sentimentalist,\r\nthe essayist and the littérateur, but also to every believer in the\r\nBible and to every friend of liberty, had become an actual question of\r\nthe day.\r\n\r\nIf only the five European Powers could agree to settle the Eastern\r\nquestion upon the basis of Syrian independence, the carrying out\r\nof the details would be an easy matter. France would no doubt agree\r\nto such an arrangement. The amount of the consideration required by\r\nTurkey would be raised from the resources of Syria, augmented by a sum\r\nto be contributed by the Jews. Their contribution might be looked upon\r\nas consideration for their admission into Syria.\r\n\r\nAn arrangement of this character would satisfy all the parties\r\nconcerned. Mehemet Ali would become the hereditary Sovereign of Egypt.\r\nFrance would be contented. The Jews would be virtually restored to\r\ntheir land. The Syrians would gladly agree, as their country would in\r\nthis way achieve independence, while the Jews would help them to gain\r\nthis end.\r\n\r\nFrom then onwards, the Jews would begin to immigrate into Syria from\r\nevery part of the world; they would carry in their train the apparatus\r\nof civilization, and would form a nucleus for the creation of European\r\ninstitutions. They would acquire and exercise the rights and duties\r\nof citizenship in their own country, and would build up, under the\r\nprotection and auspices of the five European Powers, the government\r\nand independence of the Turco-Syrian State. And from this change other\r\nadvantages also would accrue. Turkey would be relieved of the pressure\r\nthat had been destructive of her interests. The consideration that she\r\nwould receive for her consent would be the means of resuscitating her\r\nenergies and restoring her strength. It would enable her to push on\r\nher reforms and again take her position as a powerful nation.\r\n\r\nIt must at once be admitted that the condition of Syria presented a\r\nhost of difficulties, on account of the division of the inhabitants\r\ninto a number of separate tribes. But this fact only proved the\r\nnecessity for the introduction of fresh material, with a view to\r\nwelding together all classes into one harmonious community. The\r\nnecessity of introducing fresh material into the social fabric of\r\nSyria once admitted, it followed as a matter of course that the\r\nimmigration of the Jews into Syria would provide the most acceptable\r\nmaterial. The establishment of European institutions in Asia (so\r\nfar as they might be suitable) would follow, and in all probability\r\nEngland would in that way find a new ally, whose friendship might\r\neventually prove of advantage to her in dealing with Eastern affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n                   ENGLAND AND THE JEWS IN THE EAST\r\n\r\n    Damascus and Rhodes, 1840――The anti-Jewish accusations――Jewish\r\n    opinion in England and France――Two views――The persecutions and\r\n    the Zionist idea――The difficulties of a Jewish initiative――Sir\r\n    W. R. W. Wilde.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT that time an occurrence of a grave character troubled the Jews\r\nin the East. The Jews resident at Damascus and Rhodes were subjected\r\nin 1840 to cruel persecution on the false and atrocious charge that\r\nthey used human blood in the celebration of the Passover. On the 7th\r\nFebruary a Catholic Priest named Father Thomas suddenly disappeared\r\nfrom the quarter of Damascus where he resided. As he had last been\r\nseen near the shop of a Jewish barber, the latter was seized and\r\nexamined, and finally subjected to torture. In his agony he accused\r\nseveral of the principal Jews of having put Father Thomas to death.\r\nMany of the Jews were immediately thrown into prison, and the most\r\nrevolting barbarities were inflicted upon them to induce them to\r\nconfess. An appeal was made to Mehemet Ali, the _Pasha_ of Egypt, to\r\nput a stop to these horrors, and he issued peremptory instructions to\r\nthat effect, ordering that the matter should be investigated before\r\na tribunal composed of the European consuls specially delegated for\r\nthat purpose. At a later period of the year, the Jews of Rhodes were\r\naccused of having abducted a Greek boy for the purpose of murdering\r\nhim, and using his blood at the Passover, but after a trial and a long\r\ninvestigation the charge was pronounced to be false. In this case also\r\ngreat barbarities had been inflicted, and the Porte, in order to show\r\nits sense of the injustice done to the Jews, deposed the _Pasha_ of\r\nRhodes.\r\n\r\nThese events awakened _Israel_ from a long stupor. They stirred up\r\nJewish public opinion all over the world, and especially in England\r\nand France. Like all persecutions, they served to accentuate Jewish\r\nsolidarity. The first thing to do was to save the innocent martyrs;\r\nnext to this immediate necessity the question arose how to prevent\r\nsimilar attacks on Jewish life, and on the honour of Judaism. It\r\nwas necessary to raise a powerful protest against these abominable\r\naccusations, to make representations to the Governments to protect\r\nand to assist the oppressed Jews.\r\n\r\nUp to this point Jewish leaders of all shades of opinion travelled\r\nthe same road. It was only at this stage that commonplace charity and\r\npolitical foresight had to part company. To the former it seemed easy\r\nto surmount all difficulties and all objections instantly by a few\r\nplausible generalities, which to such minds were invested with the\r\nforce of axiomatic truth, and to question which they would regard\r\nas useless. Persecution, it was said, is a temporary phenomenon, and\r\nconsequently the defence should be temporary. But is the persecution\r\nof the Jews really only temporary? Are not all these outrages and\r\naccusations links in one chain? Are they not, to a certain extent,\r\nthe consequences of the precarious and untenable position of a people\r\nwithout a land? Short-sighted philanthropists, harassed by no doubts\r\nof this kind, asserted as facts what they knew in reality to be only\r\nprobabilities. There is no doubt as to their perfect good faith,\r\nnor should any wilful misrepresentation be attributed to them. They\r\nhad seized on one part of the truth, namely, that justice should\r\nbe applied to the Jews. With regard to questions of nationality and\r\nterritory they had no experience. They knew little of the conditions\r\nof the countries where the Jewish masses lived; the psychology of the\r\nnon-Jewish masses in those countries was unknown to them.\r\n\r\nBut history was against their superficial optimism, and in the minds\r\nof really thinking people grave doubts arose whether the future of\r\nthe Jewish people could be secured by haphazard defence and immediate\r\nrelief. It would be idle for the optimists to treat anxieties\r\nof this kind as if they were heresies. They were not reactionary\r\naspirations; nor were they the pretensions of ignorant spirits to\r\nbe wise beyond the limits of man’s wisdom. They were in reality the\r\nlogical consequences of experience and observation. They reveal a true\r\nconception of the Jewish problem, which is belittled and watered down\r\nby commonplace optimism.\r\n\r\nThe Damascus affair, like similar events before and after it,\r\nstimulated Zionist aspirations, not because Zionism is merely a reflex\r\nof persecution, but because persecution reveals to the Jew his real\r\nsituation, which, during the short intervals of peace, he does not\r\nclearly understand or is inclined to overlook.\r\n\r\nThough far from being the real cause――the real cause is the whole of\r\nJewish history――the sufferings of the Jews have always been a stimulus\r\nto Jewish national feeling. The Mortara case in 1860 gave rise to the\r\nAlliance Israélite Universelle, the persecutions which began in 1882\r\nto the movement of the “Lovers of _Zion_,” and the Dreyfus affair\r\nin 1894 to Herzl’s pamphlet _The Jewish State_, 1896, which heralded\r\nmodern Zionism. In the same way the Damascus and Rhodes affairs were\r\nthe immediate cause of Montefiore’s journeys, the representations\r\nto Mehemet Ali about both the innocent martyrs and the establishment\r\nof Jewish colonies in Palestine, and the societies in England for\r\nthe support of Palestinian colonization. A number of Jews in several\r\ncountries, and especially in England, began to ask themselves: What\r\nwill be the end of all these sufferings? The reply was: Two things are\r\nnecessary:――\r\n\r\n        (1) The protection of Great Britain for the Jews in the East.\r\n\r\n        (2) The colonization of Palestine.\r\n\r\nPublic opinion had now taken a different turn; and, what is more\r\nimportant, the character of the difficulties and objections generally\r\nraised had become wholly different. People began to inquire about the\r\nJews themselves: would they or would they not be inclined to form a\r\nnew society for the colonization of Palestine? A greater disposition\r\nto follow up this kind of discussion had developed. The political\r\nsense of the day required definition, argument, and proof, where\r\nreligion had been content to appeal merely to the instinct of\r\nreverence, and to put the whole matter on the plane of devotional\r\nfeeling or exalted imagination.\r\n\r\nWould the Jews go to Palestine?\r\n\r\nIn the nature of things it could not often happen that a nation\r\nwould undergo rapidly any great, although at the same time peaceful\r\nand salutary change. A nation may, indeed, develop almost in a day.\r\nEmpires have evaporated in fury or exploded in passion. But then\r\nsuch violent changes have usually been vicious and destructive. An\r\nutterly demoralized people will abandon itself in a moment to a dream\r\nof ambition, turn its ploughshares into swords, and break from its\r\nborders to conquer the world. A new field for cupidity or pleasure,\r\nthe discovery of a continent, the sudden acquisition of a fertile\r\nterritory or a mine of wealth, has ere now turned an ancient and\r\nnoble race into a rabble of adventurers. But it is very rare, almost\r\nunparalleled, for a _peaceful_ people to find a new opening all at\r\nonce. There was doubt, then, about the Jewish desire for redemption.\r\n\r\nSide by side with their attachment to the land of their birth, the\r\nsense of a long-lost home lies deep in the hearts of the Jewish masses,\r\nand they are drawn towards it by a longing expressed in heartfelt\r\nsongs and prayers, in wishes and in hopes, not in rebellious efforts.\r\nBut could the Jews by themselves, as a whole nation, or as scattered\r\nand divided masses, as a defenceless and persecuted minority, take\r\nup the realization of their cherished hope? Although it was an\r\ninternational political scheme, leading Jews would have to raise their\r\nvoices and start the work if they wished to see its accomplishment.\r\n\r\nSir William Robert Wills Wilde (1815‒1876) wrote:――¹\r\n\r\n    ¹ Narrative of a Voyage to ... the Shores of the Mediterranean,\r\n      including a visit to ... Palestine, etc. Dublin, 1840, vol.\r\n      ii., _pp._ 358‒363.\r\n\r\n“This extraordinary people, the favoured of the Lord, the descendants\r\nof the patriarchs and prophets, and the aristocracy of the earth, are\r\nto be seen in _Jerusalem_ to greater advantage, and under an aspect\r\nand in a character totally different from that which they present in\r\nany other place on the face of the globe. In other countries the very\r\nname of Jew has associated with it cunning, deceit, usury, traffic\r\nand often wealth. But here, in addition to the usual degradation and\r\npurchased suffering of a despised, stricken, outcast race, they bend\r\nunder extreme poverty, and wear the aspect of a weeping and a mourning\r\npeople; lamenting over their fallen greatness as a nation, and over\r\nthe prostrate grandeur of their once proud city. Here the usurer\r\nis turned into the pilgrim, the merchant into the priest, and the\r\ninexorable creditor into the weeping suppliant....” “It is curious,\r\n... to read the indications of fond attachment of the Jew to the very\r\nair and soil, scattered about in Jewish writings; ... ‘The air of the\r\nland of _Israel_,’ says one, ‘makes a man wise’; another writes, ‘he\r\nwho walks four cubits in the land of _Israel_ is sure of being a son\r\nof the life to come.’ The great Wise Men are wont to kiss the borders\r\nof the Holy Land, to _embrace its ruins_, and roll themselves in its\r\ndust.”¹\r\n\r\n    ¹ The German Jewish weekly, _Der Orient_ (Leipzig, 1840, N 16),\r\n      mentions “a Christian divine, Rev. William Filson Marsh\r\n      (1775‒1864), who wrote to the then Chief _Rabbi_ in London,\r\n      the Rev. Solomon Hershell (1761‒1842), about the necessity\r\n      of a Jewish state in Palestine.”\r\n\r\nThe following extracts are taken from _Der Orient_, a German newspaper.\r\nThey seem to betoken a movement among continental Jews in relation to\r\nthe late crisis in Syria:――\r\n\r\n“We have a country, the inheritance of our fathers, finer, more\r\nfruitful, better situated for commerce, than many of the most\r\ncelebrated portions of the globe. Environed by the deep-delled Taurus,\r\nthe lovely shores of the Euphrates, the lofty steppes of Arabia\r\nand of rocky _Sinai_, our country extends along the shores of the\r\nMediterranean, crowned by the towering cedars of _The Lebanon_, the\r\nsource of a hundred rivulets and brooks, which spread fruitfulness\r\nover shady dales.... A glorious land! situate at the farthest\r\nextremity of the sea which connects three-quarters of the globe, over\r\nwhich the Phœnicians ... sent their numerous fleets to the shores of\r\nAlbion, near to both the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf; ... the central\r\ncountry of the commerce between the east and the west. Every country\r\nhas its peculiarity; every people their own nature.... No people of\r\nthe earth have lived so true to their calling from the first as we\r\nhave done.\r\n\r\n“The Arab has maintained his language and his original country; on the\r\nNile, in the deserts, as far as _Sinai_, and beyond _Jordan_, he feeds\r\nhis flocks. In the elevated plains of Asia Minor the Turkoman has\r\nconquered for himself a second country, the birthplace of the Osman;\r\nbut Palestine and Syria are populated. For centuries the battlefield\r\nbetween the sons of Altai and of the Arabian wilderness, the\r\ninhabitants of the West and the half-nomadic Persians, none have been\r\nable to establish themselves and maintain their nationality: no nation\r\ncan claim the name of Syrian. A chaotic mixture of all tribes and\r\ntongues, remnants of migrations from north and south, they disturb one\r\nanother in the possession of the glorious land where our fathers for\r\nso many centuries emptied the cup of joy and woe, and where every clod\r\nis drenched with the blood of our heroes when their bodies were buried\r\nunder the ruins of _Jerusalem_....”¹\r\n\r\n    ¹ _The Times_, Thursday, December 24, 1840, _p._ 4.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Illustration: _Painted by G.

A great pioneer of Anglo-Jewish Zionism during\r\nthe Palmerston period was Sir Moses Montefiore (1784‒1885). He was\r\na man of great stability and magnanimity of character, and was much\r\nadmired by Jew and Gentile alike. There have been few Jews in history\r\nwho have been able to look back on a life of useful and beneficial\r\nactivity with so much gratification as he, or who were so entitled to\r\nfeel proud of the fact that throughout their lives they had done their\r\nduty not only to the country in which they lived, but to the ancient\r\nland of their fathers, to the English people as English patriots and\r\nto the Jewish nation as faithful sons of their race.\r\n\r\nSir Moses was an enthusiastic supporter of “The Fund for the\r\ncultivation of the land in Palestine by the Jews.” This was the\r\nharmless name given to Zionism at the beginning of his activity. We\r\nread in the _Diaries of Sir Moses and Lady Montefiore_¹:――\r\n\r\n    ¹ Diaries of Sir Moses and Lady Montefiore ... Edited by Dr.\r\n      L. Loewe,... In Two Volumes, With Illustrations. Vol. i.\r\n      London ... 1890, _p._ 167.\r\n\r\n“Friday, May 24th (1839, Safed)....\r\n\r\n“The heads of the Portuguese and German congregations came to pay\r\ntheir respects to Sir Moses and Lady Montefiore (1784‒1862). Two\r\nof these gentlemen, the Rev. Abraham Shoshana and Samuel Aboo, were\r\nlandowners in a neighbouring village, and gave their opinion on the\r\nsubject of agriculture. Sir Moses, referring in his diary to the\r\nconversation, says:――\r\n\r\n‘From all information I have been able to gather, the land in this\r\nneighbourhood appears to be particularly favourable for agricultural\r\nspeculation. There are groves of olive trees, I should think, more\r\nthan five hundred years old, vineyards, much pasture, plenty of wells\r\nand abundance of excellent water; also fig-trees, walnuts, almonds,\r\nmulberries, etc., and rich fields of wheat, barley, and lentils; in\r\nfact it is a land that would produce almost everything in abundance,\r\nwith very little skill and labour. I am sure if the plan I have in\r\ncontemplation should succeed, it will be the means of introducing\r\nhappiness and plenty into the Holy Land. In the first instance, I\r\nshall apply to Mohhammad (Mehemet) Ali for a grant of land for fifty\r\nyears; some one or two hundred villages; giving him an increased\r\nrent of from ten to twenty per cent., and paying the whole in money\r\nannually in Alexandria, but the land and villages to be free, during\r\nthe whole term, from every tax or rate either of _Pasha_ or Governor\r\nof the several districts; and liberty being accorded to dispose\r\nof the produce in any quarter of the globe. The grant obtained, I\r\nshall, please Heaven, on my return to England, form a company for\r\nthe cultivation of the land and the encouragement of our brethren in\r\nEurope to return to Palestine. Many Jews now emigrate to New South\r\nWales, Canada, _etc._, but in the Holy Land they would find a greater\r\ncertainty of success; here they will find wells already dug, olives\r\nand vines already planted, and a land so rich as to require little\r\nmanure. By degrees I hope to induce the return of thousands of our\r\nbrethren to the Land of _Israel_. I am sure they would be happy in the\r\nenjoyment of the observance of our holy religion, in a manner which is\r\nimpossible in Europe.’”\r\n\r\nPolitical steps were undertaken and representations made. Sir Moses\r\nspoke to Lord Palmerston about agriculture for the Jews in Palestine:――\r\n\r\n“On April 30th (1840) the Committee proceeded to Downing Street,\r\nand were most kindly received by Lord Palmerston. He promised to use\r\nhis influence with Mohhammad Ali and the Turkish Government to put a\r\nstop to such atrocities.¹ Sir Moses mentioned on this occasion, when\r\nLord Palmerston was speaking of his visit to Palestine, Mr. Young’s\r\nhumanity at _Jerusalem_, and also the fact that the Jews were desirous\r\nof being employed in agricultural pursuits.”²\r\n\r\n    ¹ Damascus.\r\n\r\n    ² _Ibid._, _p._ 214.\r\n\r\nThen arose the question of Great Britain’s protection of the Jews in\r\nthe East:――\r\n\r\n“His brethren in the East appealed to Sir Moses to intercede with\r\nthe English Government to take them under their protection. They\r\ncomplained of being compelled by local governors to pay heavier\r\ntaxes than any of the non-Israelite inhabitants. Both Lord Palmerston\r\nand his successor Lord Aberdeen listened with great kindness to the\r\nstatements made to them on that subject by Sir Moses. Lord Palmerston,\r\nin reply to his representations, said the Christians had suffered more\r\nthan the Jews from the Governor being a fanatic, and added that he\r\n(Sir Moses) had his authority to write to the Jews in the East that\r\nif they had any serious complaints to make, the English Consuls would\r\nattend to them, and forward them to the Ambassador at Constantinople,\r\nwho would represent them to the Ministers of the Porte....\r\n\r\n“Lord Aberdeen, with whom he subsequently had an interview on the same\r\nsubject, said that he saw no objection to the British Consul receiving\r\nthe statements of grievances made by the Jews, and transmitting such\r\nstatements to the British Ambassador in Constantinople, who would be\r\ndirected to confer thereon with the Ministers of the Porte, with a\r\nview to the redress of the grievances complained of.”\r\n\r\n“On Sir Moses pressing the desire of the Jews in the East to be\r\nbrought under British protection, his Lordship said that he did\r\nnot see how it could be accomplished. All the European Powers were\r\nextremely jealous of any interference on the part of England. His\r\nLordship added, however, that he would consider the best means to\r\nafford the Jews protection for the sake of humanity and justice.\r\n\r\n“On the 7th November, Sir Stratford Canning (1786‒1880),¹ previous\r\nto leaving for Constantinople, called on Sir Moses, and afterwards\r\nsent him a note, appointing to see him on the following day at twelve\r\no’clock. Sir Moses accordingly went to him. The purpose of this\r\ninterview was to solicit protection for the _Israelites_ in the East.\r\nSir Moses informed him of the directions given by Lord Palmerston, and\r\nSir Stratford said he would be happy to do all that his duty permitted,\r\nand to hear from Sir Moses whenever he pleased. They had a long and\r\ninteresting conversation respecting the Jews and the Holy Land, and\r\nSir Moses was exceedingly satisfied by Sir Stratford’s kindness.”²\r\n\r\n    ¹ The Rt. Hon. Sir Stratford Canning――afterwards Viscount\r\n      (1852) Stratford _de_ Redcliffe, G.C.B.\r\n\r\n    ² _Ibid._, _pp._ 303‒304.\r\n\r\nIt may be pointed out here that the extension of Great Britain’s\r\nprotection to the Jews in the East was at that time regarded in other\r\ncountries as something to which the Jews were justly entitled, and the\r\ngranting of this protection was supposed to be necessitated by English\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\nDr. Edward Robinson (1797‒1863), the eminent American scholar, wrote:――\r\n\r\n“France has long been the acknowledged protector of the Roman Catholic\r\nreligion, in the same Empire; and the followers of that faith find\r\nin her a watchful and efficient patron;... In the members of the\r\nGreek Church, still more numerous, ... the Russians have even warmer\r\npartisans.... But where are England’s partisans in any part of Turkey?\r\nThat England, while she has so deep a political interest in all that\r\nconcerns the Turkish Empire, should remain indifferent to this state\r\nof things in Syria, is a matter of surprise.”¹\r\n\r\n    ¹ Biblical Researches in Palestine,... By Edward Robinson,\r\n      D.D.... Vol. iii. London, MDCCCXLI., _pp._ 464‒465.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the formal difficulties indicated by Lord Aberdeen\r\nthe scheme grew, and Sir Moses received very sincere promises, for\r\ndespite the force of Lord Aberdeen’s reasoning, it was too subtle\r\nto commend itself to the common sense of Sir Moses, who was acting\r\nnot as a diplomatist, but as an ardent protector of his oppressed\r\npeople. The two points in Sir Moses’ programme were his scheme for the\r\ncolonization of Palestine and his efforts to obtain British protection.\r\n\r\nSir Moses had started his second voyage to Palestine in 1838. He was\r\nthen already a friend of Mehemet Ali. Reaching Alexandria on July 13th,\r\nhe was cordially received by the _Pasha_, who listened attentively as\r\nhe unfolded his scheme. Mehemet Ali promised every assistance. “You\r\nshall have any portion of land open for sale in Syria,” he said, “and\r\nany other land which by application to the _Sultan_ may be procured\r\nfor you. You may have anyone you would like to appoint as Governor in\r\nany of the rural districts of the Holy Land, and I will do everything\r\nthat lies in my power to support your praiseworthy endeavours.” He\r\nfurther gave instructions to the Minister of Finance, Burghas _Bey_,\r\nto confirm these assurances in writing.\r\n\r\n“A new era seemed dawning for the Jews of the Holy Land. Sir Moses\r\nreturned to England with a light heart, and prepared to put his plans\r\ninto execution.... He was still conning over the voluminous data he\r\nhad collected, and was constructing in his mind the foundation of a\r\nnew commonwealth for Palestine, when he was suddenly called upon to\r\nproceed again to the East,――this time, not as a peaceful reformer,\r\nbut as the champion of his people, charged to vindicate their honour\r\nin the face of a foul conspiracy. He cheerfully laid aside his\r\nagricultural schemes, and girded up his loins for the new enterprise.\r\nWhen he returned home in the following spring, crowned with laurels,\r\nand hailed on all sides as the deliverer of _Israel_, his triumph was\r\nclouded by one sad thought――the projects to which he had devoted the\r\nwhole of the previous year were no longer possible. Mehemet Ali had\r\nceased to be lord of Syria, and his improving rule had been replaced\r\nby the asphyxiating authority of the Stamboul _Effendis_, under whom\r\nquestions of social well-being could expect little furtherance.”¹\r\n\r\n    ¹ _The Life of Sir Moses Montefiore_, by Lucien Wolf. London,\r\n      1884, _pp._ 78‒79.\r\n\r\nIn these words Mr. Lucien Wolf, in his excellent _Life_, describes\r\nthe change that took place in the plans of Sir Moses. The change was,\r\nhowever, quite superficial. If we consider all the facts and documents,\r\nwe cannot doubt that Sir Moses was a great Zionist throughout his\r\nwhole life. His type stands midway in the evolution of Zionism. He\r\nwas not unconscious of the exaltedness, the pathos, the revulsion of\r\nfeeling that the struggle for the revival of a nation awakens in the\r\nnormal mind of a Jew. His rôle as a “champion of his people” in his\r\nZionist efforts is of far greater importance than his defence of the\r\nunfortunate Jewish sufferers in Damascus. The latter was a necessity,\r\nand it was indeed a great honour for any man to be entrusted with\r\nthe perilous mission of defending these innocent martyrs. But\r\nunquestionably noble and necessary as it was to struggle against\r\nthose shamelessly fabricated charges which have unfortunately been\r\nbrought against the Jews again and again, and to protest against that\r\ngross libel upon the honour and humanity of Judaism, a libel that\r\naccused the Jews of being murderers and cannibals, can such a struggle\r\nbe compared for dignity and greatness with the stimulating effort\r\nfor national regeneration? What was the result of all these pleas\r\nof defence? Some individuals were saved from martyrdom; but since\r\nthen the same terrible accusation has been levelled against the\r\nJews a hundred times over, and it is hurled at them in our own time\r\nwith still greater malice and wickedness than in 1840. No one would\r\nunderrate the great value and the imperative necessity of Jewish\r\nself-defence; but the efforts undertaken by Sir Moses in 1838 were\r\nmore than merely defensive――they were an attempt to transform the\r\nwhole situation.\r\n\r\nReviewing the results of the whole period here surveyed, we see that\r\nwhat Sir Moses attempted was in fact Zionism, political Zionism. It\r\nwas, however, left to a later generation to take up the work afresh,\r\non lines dictated by sound political reasoning. The new generation had\r\nalready an organization behind it; Sir Moses acted as an individual.\r\nHe could not have succeeded even if the political circumstances had\r\nbeen radically different. The first essential to colonization, though\r\none which has been generally overlooked, is a national movement to\r\nsupport it. So many illusions are shattered by the cold touch of\r\nreality: the best that the regenerator can do is to close his eyes\r\nand to go boldly forward, supported by the strength and the enthusiasm\r\nof the masses, for in that way he can overcome the most formidable\r\nobstacles. But the practical side has also to be considered.\r\nColonization can never be successfully established without large\r\ncapital and carefully laid plans. All these conditions were lacking in\r\nSir Moses’ day. It is, therefore, no matter for surprise that the plan\r\non which Sir Moses had so confidently relied slipped out of his hands.\r\n\r\nBut Zionism was undoubtedly the greatest and noblest of Sir Moses’\r\naspirations. He made seven journeys to Palestine together with his\r\nwife, who shared his devotion and enthusiasm: and many of these\r\njourneys were very dangerous. _Jerusalem_ was the watchword of his\r\nlife. One of his last expressions, as quoted by a biographer, was:\r\n“I do not expect that all _Israelites_ will quit their abodes in those\r\nterritories in which they feel happy, even as there are Englishmen\r\nin Hungary, Germany, America and Japan: _but Palestine must belong to\r\nthe Jews_, and _Jerusalem_ is destined to become the seat of a Jewish\r\nCommonwealth.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n                         EARL OF SHAFTESBURY\r\n\r\n    Diaries of 1830‒40――The first English Vice-Consul for\r\n    _Jerusalem_――Lord Lindsay’s travels in Egypt and the Holy Land\r\n    ――A guarantee of five Powers――Lord Shaftesbury’s conception of\r\n    a spiritual centre for the Jewish nation.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE Zionist idea not only has a long and unbroken history in England;\r\nit links together periods and men of the most widely different\r\nconvictions and emotions. This truth is illustrated by the fact that\r\nat the very time when Sir Moses was endeavouring to found a Jewish\r\nCommonwealth in Palestine, another famous man, one of the greatest\r\nChristians in this country, was working in his way and according to\r\nhis lights, with similar enthusiasm and strength of conviction, for\r\nprecisely the same cause. This was the seventh Earl of Shaftesbury\r\n(1801‒1885), one of the most interesting personalities of the age, a\r\nman of the soundest intellect and the keenest perceptions, sagacious,\r\nfar-seeing, of great honesty of purpose, modest and averse from\r\nnotoriety, an ardent Christian and a broad-minded philanthropist.¹\r\n\r\n    ¹ In Lord Shaftesbury, the earnest Christian philanthropist,\r\n      the world was not slow to recognize the most eminent social\r\n      reformer of the nineteenth century. The Duke of Argyll\r\n      (1823‒1900) thus described him in a memorable speech\r\n      in the House of Lords, and the eulogy was endorsed by\r\n      Lord Salisbury (1830‒1903): “The family motto of the\r\n      Shaftesburys, ‘Love, serve,’ was well exemplified in the\r\n      character of his life. His efforts and his influence were\r\n      interwoven with many of the most humane movements of two\r\n      generations. Pre-eminently the friend of the poor, the\r\n      degraded and the outcast, his generous sympathies and his\r\n      ceaseless labours on behalf of the classes in whom he took\r\n      so deep an interest, have given him a high place in the\r\n      illustrious roll of benevolent Englishmen. The epitaph\r\n      which the Eastern _Rabbi_ desired for himself might with\r\n      perfect truth be applied to Lord Shaftesbury, ‘Write me as\r\n      one who loves his fellow-men.’”\r\n\r\nLord Shaftesbury writes in his _Diaries_¹ on September 29th, 1838:――\r\n\r\n    ¹ Edwin Hodder: _The Life and Work of the Seventh Earl of\r\n      Shaftesbury_, London, 1886.\r\n\r\n“Took leave this morning of Young, who has just been appointed Her\r\nMajesty’s Vice-Consul at _Jerusalem_! He will sail in a day or two to\r\nthe Holy Land. If this is duly considered, what a wonderful event it\r\nis! The ancient city of the people of God is about to resume a place\r\namong the nations, and England is the first of the Gentile Kingdoms\r\nthat ceases ‘to tread her down.’ If I had not an aversion to writing,\r\nalmost insuperable, I would record here, for the benefit of my very\r\nweak and treacherous memory, all the steps whereby this good deed has\r\nbeen done, but the arrangement of the narrative, and the execution of\r\nit, would cost me too much penmanship; I shall always, at any rate,\r\nremember that God put it into my heart to conceive the plan for His\r\nhonour, gave me influence to prevail with Palmerston, and provided a\r\nman for the situation, who ‘can remember _Jerusalem_ in his mirth’”\r\n(vol. i., _p._ 233).\r\n\r\nIt was, as we see, a sublimely conceived notion of Lord Shaftesbury’s\r\nthat _Jerusalem_ was about to resume a place among the nations, and\r\nthat England was destined to carry out God’s designs.\r\n\r\nHe continues on October 3rd, 1838:――\r\n\r\n“Lord Lindsay’s¹ ‘Travels in Egypt and the Holy Land’ are very\r\ncreditable to him, ... Egypt will yield largely in confirmation of the\r\nJewish records; and Palestine, when dug and harrowed by enterprising\r\ntravellers, must exhibit the past with all the vividness of the\r\npresent. The very violences of Ibrahim _Pasha_² (1789‒1848) (the\r\nScourge of Syria) have opened the first sources of its political\r\nregeneration by offering free access to the stranger in the repression\r\nof native lawlessness; hundreds now go in a twelvemonth when one trod\r\nthe way in a quarter of a century, and the Bible is becoming a common\r\nroad-book” (_Ibid._).\r\n\r\n    ¹ Afterwards the twenty-fifth Earl of Crawford (1812‒1880).\r\n\r\n    ² Second son of Mehemet Ali.\r\n\r\nThe last sentence proves the Biblical character of England’s devotion\r\nto Palestine. English thinkers and statesmen particularly appreciated\r\nthe fact that no country has been the scene of the principal drama of\r\nhuman developments for so many centuries as Palestine, and no other\r\nbears upon its memory so many of the scars of those great convulsions\r\nthat have shaped the main features of history.\r\n\r\nHe writes on July 24th, 1838:――\r\n\r\n“It seems as though money were the only thing wanting to regenerate\r\nthe world. Never was an age so fertile in good plans, or with\r\napparently more and better men to execute them, but where are the\r\nmeans?... Why money would almost restore the Jews to the Holy Land.\r\nCertainly so far as Mehemet Ali is the arbiter of their destinies....\r\n\r\n“Anxious about the hopes and destinies of the Jewish people.\r\nEverything seems ripe for their return to Palestine; ‘the way of the\r\nkings of the East is prepared.’ Could the five Powers of the West\r\nbe induced to guarantee the security of life and possessions to the\r\n_Hebrew_ race, they would now flow back in rapidly augmenting numbers.\r\nThen by the blessing of God I will prepare a document, fortify it\r\nby all the evidence I can accumulate, and, confiding to the wisdom\r\nand mercy of the Almighty, lay it before the Secretary of State for\r\nForeign Affairs” (_Ibid._, _p._ 310).\r\n\r\nIt may be observed that the Zionist formula of the Basle programme,\r\ndemanding a home for the Jewish people secured by public law, is\r\nidentical with the “guarantee of the Great Powers” suggested by Lord\r\nShaftesbury.\r\n\r\nNot only the questions of nationality involved in the realization\r\nof this important programme, but also the question of the creation\r\nof a spiritual nucleus for the _Hebrew_ genius――one of the cherished\r\naspirations of Zionists――occupied Lord Shaftesbury’s mind quite as\r\nmuch as the political proposition:――\r\n\r\nThe inherent vitality of the _Hebrew_ race reasserts itself with\r\namazing persistence; its genius, to tell the truth, adapts itself\r\nmore or less to all currents of civilization all over the world,\r\nnevertheless always emerging with distinctive features and a gallant\r\nrecovery of vigour. There is an unbroken identity of Jewish race and\r\nJewish mind down to our times: but the great revival can take place\r\nonly in the Holy Land.\r\n\r\nHe then proceeds to the practical steps.\r\n\r\n“August 1st, 1838.――Dined with Palmerston. After dinner left alone\r\nwith him. Propounded my scheme, which seemed to strike his fancy;\r\nhe asked some questions, and readily promised to consider it. How\r\nsingular is the order of Providence! Singular, that is if estimated\r\nby man’s ways! Palmerston had already been chosen by God to be an\r\ninstrument of good to His ancient people, to do homage, as it were,\r\nto their inheritance, and to recognise their rights without believing\r\ntheir destiny. And it seems he will yet do more. But though the\r\nmotive be kind, it is not sound. I am forced to argue politically,\r\nfinancially, commercially; these considerations strike him home; he\r\nweeps not like his Master over _Jerusalem_, nor prays that now, at\r\nlast, she may put on her beautiful garments....” (_Ibid._, _pp._\r\n310‒11).\r\n\r\nIn these few lines we see the Zionist problem in its two aspects: Lord\r\nShaftesbury dealing with it _sub specie æternitatis_, so thoroughly\r\ninfused with the sense of its dignity that the reader’s imagination\r\nis constantly stirred to the same feeling, and Lord Palmerston, the\r\ndiplomatist, though of opinion that the scheme, constructed in a mist\r\nof hazy ideas, aspirations and emotions, required more clearness, yet\r\nagreeing in the main and demanding more details regarding the economic\r\nand statistical side of the subject. The difference between the two\r\nmen was this: Lord Palmerston was a great political leader, Lord\r\nShaftesbury was a great Christian.\r\n\r\n_The Quarterly Review_ for January, 1839, published a masterly article\r\nby Lord Shaftesbury. It is a review and an appreciation of “Letters\r\non Egypt, Edom, and the Holy Land, by Lord Lindsay, 1838.” He writes:\r\n“We have alluded, in the commencement of this article, to the growing\r\ninterest manifested in behalf of the Holy Land. This interest is not\r\nconfined to the Christians――it is shared and avowed by the whole body\r\nof Jews,... Doubtless, this is no new sentiment among the children\r\nof the dispersion. The novelty of the present day does not lie in\r\nthe indulgence of such a hope ... but in their fearless confession\r\nof the hope; and in the approximation of spirit between Christians\r\nand _Hebrews_, to entertain the same belief of the future glories of\r\n_Israel_,... In most former periods a development of religious feeling\r\nhas been followed by a persecution of the ancient people of God;...\r\nBut a mighty change has come over the hearts of the Gentiles; they\r\nseek now the ... peace of the _Hebrew_ people. One of them ... went a\r\njourney into Poland ... informs us that several thousand Jews in that\r\ncountry and of Russia have recently bound themselves by an oath, that,\r\nas soon as the way is open for them to go up to _Jerusalem_, they will\r\nimmediately go thither,... Dr. [Joseph] Wolff (1795‒1862) (_Journal_,\r\n1833)¹ (_sic_) heard these sentiments from their lips in the remotest\r\ncountries of Asia; and Buchanan asserts that wherever he went among\r\nthe Jews of India, he found memorials of their expulsion from Judæa,\r\nand of their belief of a return thither.... In Poland, the great focus\r\nof the _Hebrew_ people, the sentiment is most rife that the time is\r\nnear at hand for the turning of their captivity:...” (_pp._ 176‒9).\r\n\r\n        ¹ Journal of the Rev.

Then\r\nthe war intervened, Mehemet Ali was obliged to come to terms, and\r\non July 18th, 1841, the new “Treaty of London for the Pacification\r\nof the Levant” was signed. Mehemet Ali abandoned his claim to Syria\r\non condition that the Khedivate of Egypt was made hereditary in his\r\nfamily. This was a turning-point of much significance in the history\r\nof Palestine. At that moment the Jews might have been able to regain\r\ntheir ancient land, if only they had had an organization for carrying\r\nout the plan.\r\n\r\nThe only country in the world where this idea found influential\r\nexpression at the time was England. The events in the East were\r\nnaturally of intense interest to Lord Shaftesbury, and stimulated him\r\nto greater activity.\r\n\r\nHe writes in his _Diary_, on August 24th, 1840: “The _Times_ of 17th\r\nAugust filled me with astonishment. I wish I had put down at the\r\nmoment what I felt at reading it; half satisfaction, half dismay;\r\npleased to see my opinions and projects so far taken up and approved;\r\n――alarmed lest this premature disclosure of them should bring upon us\r\nall the charge of fanaticism. Now who could have believed, a few years\r\nago, that this subject could have been treated in a newspaper of wide\r\ncirculation, gravely, sincerely, and zealously, yet so it is; and\r\nwho sees not the handwriting of God upon the wall? The very insults,\r\nmisrepresentations, and persecutions of the Jews at Damascus bring\r\nforward the main question; and Mehemet Ali, ‘howbeit he thinketh not\r\nso,’ is a mighty instrument for the benefit of this people!\r\n\r\n“Palmerston told me that he has already written to Lord Ponsonby¹\r\n(1780?‒1855) to direct him to open an intercourse with Reschid\r\n_Pasha_ (1802‒1858) at ♦Constantinople respecting protection and\r\nencouragement to the Jews. This is a prelude to the Antitype of the\r\ndecree of Cyrus, but, humanly speaking, we must pray for more caution.\r\nThose gentlemen who have now got access to the columns of the _Times_\r\nwill, by over-zeal, bring a charge of fanaticism on the whole question.\r\nO God, from whom _alone_ cometh all counsel, wisdom, and understanding,\r\nbe Thou our Guide, our Instructor, and our Friend” (_Ibid._, _p._ 311).\r\n\r\n    ¹ John Viscount Ponsonby.\r\n\r\n    ♦ “Constaninople” replaced with “Constantinople”\r\n\r\nOn August 29th, 1840, he writes:――\r\n\r\n“The newspapers teem with documents about the Jews. Many assail,\r\nand many defend them. I have as yet read nothing (except [the Rev.\r\nAlexander] M’Caul’s (1799‒1863) treatise) which exhibits any statement\r\neither new or clever. The motion of the _Times_ in this matter has\r\nstirred up an immense variety of projects and opinions; everyone has\r\na thought, and everyone has an interpretation. What a chaos of schemes\r\nand disputes is on the horizon, for the time when the affairs of\r\nthe Jews shall be really and fully before the world! What violence,\r\nwhat hatred, what combination, what discussion. What a stir of every\r\npassion, every feeling in men’s hearts!...” (_Ibid._, _p._ 311).\r\n\r\nOn September 25th, 1840, he writes:――\r\n\r\n“Yesterday began my paper for Palmerston, containing in full the\r\npropositions for the recall of the Jews to their ancient land.\r\n‘Recall’ is too strong; it is simply a ‘permission,’ should they think\r\nfit to avail themselves of it. I wish to prepare a short document,\r\nwhich may refresh his memory, and exist as a record both of the\r\nsuggestion and the character of it” (_Ibid._, _p._ 312).\r\n\r\nWe may confess that at times we find Lord Shaftesbury’s ideas somewhat\r\ntoo largely influenced by his religious zeal; yet he did succeed\r\nin mastering his emotions and dealing with the problem in a sound\r\nand statesmanlike manner. In this document of his we find not only\r\ngenerous ideas but also excellent arguments, simply and convincingly\r\nstated (Appendix liii).\r\n\r\nOn November 4th, 1840, he writes:――\r\n\r\n“I hope I have done right in this: I have suppressed all party\r\nconsiderations, and have used every effort to persuade the _Times_\r\nto take just views of the Syrian question. I have been successful.\r\nLord Palmerston told me this evening that the concurrence of the Tory\r\npapers had smoothed ten thousand difficulties....” (_Ibid._, _p._ 315).\r\n\r\nThe articles in _The Times_, to which Lord Shaftesbury refers,\r\nappeared in that newspaper at various periods. On the 9th March, 1840\r\n(_p._ 3), _The Times_ published the following notice:――\r\n\r\n“_Restoration of the Jews._――A memorandum has been addressed to the\r\nProtestant monarchs of Europe on the subject of the restoration of\r\nthe Jewish people to the land of Palestine. The document in question,\r\ndictated by the peculiar conjuncture of affairs in the East, and the\r\nother striking ‘signs of the times,’ reverts to the original covenant\r\nwhich secures that land to the descendants of _Abraham_, and urges\r\nupon the consideration of the powers addressed what may be the\r\nprobable line of Protestant Christendom to the Jewish people in the\r\npresent controversy in the East. The memorandum and correspondence\r\nwhich has passed upon the subject have been published.”\r\n\r\nThis Memorandum (Appendix liv) is written entirely from a Christian\r\npoint of view. Lord Shaftesbury, although himself a staunch believer\r\nin Christianity, was more inclined to give the project a practical\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th August, 1840, _The Times_ (_p._ 3) published the following\r\narticle:――\r\n\r\n                 “_Syria.――Restoration of the Jews._\r\n\r\n“The proposition to plant the Jewish people in the land of their\r\nfathers, under the protection of the five Powers, is no longer a mere\r\nmatter of speculation, but of serious political consideration. In a\r\nministerial paper of the 31st of July an article appears bearing all\r\nthe characteristics of a feeler on this deeply interesting subject.\r\nHowever, it has been reserved for a noble Lord opposed to Her\r\nMajesty’s Ministers to take up the subject in a practical and\r\nstatesmanlike manner, and he is instituting inquiries, of which the\r\nfollowing is a copy:――\r\n\r\n“1. What are the feelings of the Jews you meet with respect to their\r\nreturn to the Holy Land?\r\n\r\n“2. Would the Jews of station and property be inclined to return\r\nto Palestine, carry with them their capital, and invest it in the\r\ncultivation of the land, if by the operation of law and justice life\r\nand property were rendered secure?\r\n\r\n“3. How soon would they be inclined and ready to go back?\r\n\r\n“4. Would they go back entirely at their own expense, requiring\r\nnothing farther than the assurance of safety to person and estate?\r\n\r\n“5. Would they be content to live under the Government of the country\r\nas they should find it, their rights and privileges being secured to\r\nthem under the protection of the European Powers?\r\n\r\n“Let the answers you procure be as distinct and decided and detailed\r\nas possible: in respect as to the inquiries as to property, it will\r\nof course be sufficient that you should obtain fair proof of the fact\r\nfrom general report.\r\n\r\n“The noble Lord who is instituting these inquiries has given deep\r\nattention to the matter, and is well known as the writer of an able\r\narticle in the _Quarterly_ on the subject, in December, 1838.”\r\n\r\nThe adherents of the idea of Jewish assimilation in Germany started a\r\nkind of opposition.\r\n\r\nThe _Allgemeine Zeitung des Judentums_ dealt with this matter on the\r\n19th September, 1840, and admitted with regard to the articles in the\r\n_Globe_, which it described as “a London Ministerial newspaper,” that\r\n“the plans may all be classed among the things devoutly to be desired.”\r\nOn the other hand, this paper quotes from the _Courier Français_\r\nof August 26th, 1840, a comparison between _M._ A. M. L. de P. de\r\nLamartine (1790‒1869) (the poet, and at that time Deputy) and Lord\r\nPalmerston in the following words:――\r\n\r\n“M. de Lamartine intends to form a Christian kingdom at the sources of\r\nthe _Jordan_, and at the foot of _Mount Lebanon_; if only _Jerusalem_,\r\nthe Holy City, came into the power of France, he would gladly leave\r\nthe rest of the world to England and Russia. But what is odd in the\r\nwhole affair is that Lord Palmerston has chosen the same spot. Where\r\nthe celebrated Deputy dreams of a Christian state, Lord Palmerston\r\nprojects a Jewish Republic.”\r\n\r\nThis jest caused the _Allgemeine Zeitung des Judentums_ to “protest\r\nagainst the project in question,” and “to warn the young people.” All\r\nwe learn from this pronouncement is that the Jewish youth was at the\r\ntime inclined to listen to the Zionist idea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\n                      RESTORATION AND PROTECTION\r\n\r\n    A new Memorandum――The “Balance of Power”――Palestine and\r\n    “Rights” in other countries――A “Memorial of the Church of\r\n    Scotland”――Protection for the Jews in the East.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME time afterwards a new Memorandum appeared in the press, which\r\nmay be considered one of the highest eulogies of Zionism ever written\r\n(Appendix lv). It combines religious conviction with an appreciation\r\nof political realism. The writers――this article being the expression\r\nof the opinions of a group of statesmen――deal with political problems\r\nwhich were then of the highest interest and importance, and indicate\r\nwith sufficient clearness a probable solution, emphasizing the view\r\nthat “the cause of the Restoration of the Jews to Palestine is one\r\nessentially generous and noble.” They do not fail to realize the\r\ncomplexity of the problem and the many cross-currents and jealousies,\r\nbut arrive at the conclusion that there is a remedy for all these\r\nconflicts in the colonization of Palestine by the Jews. They even\r\ngo much further than this, for they point out that “it would be a\r\ncrowning-point in the glory of England to bring about such an event.”\r\n\r\nThe writer of an article entitled “A Regard for the Jews,”¹ drew the\r\nfollowing historical parallel:――\r\n\r\n    ¹ _Globe_, August 14, 1840.\r\n\r\n“To afford the Jew an opportunity of returning to Palestine, if he\r\nchooses, and of dwelling there in peace and security, will hereafter\r\nform one of the brightest gems in the crown of Britain. Cyrus, for\r\npermitting the captive Jews to go up to _Jerusalem_, was honoured with\r\nan everlasting memorial upon the pages of inspiration. Britain will\r\nnot miss a recompense of equal worth and honour for an act of the\r\nsame enlightened benevolence. For this the present time is most happy\r\nand opportune――for the stirring and philanthropic portion of the\r\npublic are alive to the case of the Jews, and would hail with loudest\r\napplause that government which would thus lay the top-stone upon all\r\nthe kind exertions hitherto made in favour of that people.”\r\n\r\nIt is a common notion, particularly among some Jewish opponents of\r\nZionism, to suppose that some non-Jewish supporters of this idea may\r\nbe jealous of Jewish equality in the countries where they live, and\r\nmay hope to get rid of the Jews. As a matter of fact, however, the\r\npromoters of the idea of Restoration have always been opposed to any\r\nsort of persecution or degradation.\r\n\r\nHere the writer touched upon one of the most important controversial\r\npoints: the alleged incompatibility of the Restoration of the Jews\r\nto Palestine with their rights of citizenship in other countries.\r\nThis contention has been made use of by some Jewish opponents of\r\nmodern Zionism. We have dealt with the point in the Introduction, and\r\nshall have to return to it again. Here we only call attention to the\r\nbroad-minded and lofty manner in which this English writer pointed\r\nout the fallacy of this supposed contradiction between Palestine and\r\n“rights,” which has arisen only through narrowness of judgment and\r\nwant of logic. It is curious indeed to find that Jewish opponents\r\nwere always wont to speak on this point in the name of Christians, but\r\nin a strain quite opposed to expressed ideas and the attitude of the\r\nChristians most competent to decide. The plain fact is, as the writer\r\nsays, that “the promoters of the idea of Restoration have always been\r\nopposed to any sort of persecution and degradation.” This theory of\r\na supposed irreconcilability of Palestine and “rights” is logically\r\nfallacious from another standpoint. The defenders of the theory refuse\r\nto consider sufficiently the question of the nature of rights and\r\nfreedom. At times they seem to opine that Jews have to renounce their\r\ntraditions in order to get “rights”; at other times they appear to\r\nemphasize that freedom which is obtainable by means of “rights.” But\r\nin reality rights are not necessarily freedom; a man who aspires to\r\nculture but is forced to renounce his aspirations is not free. On the\r\nother hand, for a group of persons to abandon their traditions is not\r\nfreedom. Freedom in the positive sense, the only sense which gives it\r\nany value, is the privilege of a wide choice, because the privilege of\r\nchoice is the primary condition of real development and productiveness.\r\nHence the only logical and liberal formula is that indicated by\r\nthe writer of the Memorandum; “to afford the Jew an opportunity of\r\nreturning to Palestine if he chooses.” Modern Zionism has expressed\r\nthe same idea in other words: Palestine should be for those Jews who\r\ncannot amalgamate with others or are not desirous of doing so.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the question of the protection to be granted to the\r\nJews in the East continued to occupy English minds a great deal. _The\r\nTimes_, December 3, 1840, _p._ 6, has an article on “The Jews” which\r\nreads:――\r\n\r\n“The following Memorial has lately been presented by the Church of\r\nScotland to the Secretary for Foreign Affairs:――\r\n\r\n“‘To the Right Hon. Lord Viscount Palmerston, Her Majesty’s Principal\r\nSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs....\r\n\r\n“‘Your memorialists cannot help expressing the thankfulness which\r\nthey, and all others interested in the welfare of the Jewish people,\r\nmust feel to your Lordship, for the countenance which you have\r\ngiven to other societies having at heart the same objects with\r\nyour memorialists at the Porte and with the Pasha of Egypt, and for\r\nrecommending the Jews to the especial protection of the consul sent\r\nto Syria by Her Majesty’s Government.\r\n\r\n“‘Your memorialists look with deep interest on the transactions now\r\ngoing on in Syria, which they trust will result in the more firm and\r\nmore extensive establishment of British influence in that interesting\r\nland: and deeply impressed with the conviction that it is a revealed\r\ntruth of the word of God, that the blessing of God is promised to\r\nthose who succour His ancient but now afflicted people, whether\r\nnations or individuals, they are most anxious that, in any future\r\nsettlement of that country, under the auspices of Britain, your\r\nLordship and Her Majesty’s Government should take measures as far as\r\npossible for protecting the Jews against oppression and injustice....’”\r\n\r\nWith reference to this Memorial the _Globe_ made the following\r\nremarks:――\r\n\r\n“Great Britain has taught the nations a lesson of charity, as well as\r\nfaith, by taking God’s ancient people under her special protection.\r\nWhilst some of the Powers of the earth have wavered, and continue\r\nto do homage to the spirit of unjust prejudice and the practice of\r\npersecution, to Great Britain belongs the just praise of asserting the\r\nclaims of justice and mercy by interposing in several periods of her\r\nhistory on behalf of the unhappy victims of national and religious\r\nhatred. All that are interested in the cause of suffering humanity\r\nturn their eyes towards Great Britain.”\r\n\r\nThe writer continues:――\r\n\r\n“Why has England been so watched over and so preserved? Has any other\r\ncountry such a history? The histories of many other countries are\r\nmade up of wars and rumours of wars in defence of their homes from\r\nforeign invaders――England, save civil wars, chiefly in the struggle\r\nfor civil and religious liberty. Why should so small a speck on\r\nthe earth’s surface as England be able to control an enormous and\r\npopulous-scattered Empire on which the sun never sets? Why should\r\nEngland be the terror of the oppressor and the asylum of the\r\noppressed? It is by the spirit of God, by the great zeal and industry\r\nto be profitable and useful to the world, by readiness to take any\r\npains, and give any assistance to the furthering of justice. Therefore\r\nEngland gave special protection to the Jews.”\r\n\r\nFrom this we gather that public opinion regarded the protection of\r\nthe Jews in the East by England as an accomplished fact, though not\r\nofficially proclaimed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\n                      PROTECTION AND RESTORATION\r\n\r\n    The _Don_ Pacifico case――Admiral Sir William Parker――Lord\r\n    Stanley――Mr. J. A. Roebuck――Lord Palmerston’s policy attacked\r\n    ――Peel and the Opposition――Plans for colonization of Palestine\r\n    ――Mordecai Manuel Noah――Warder Cresson――Rev. A. G. H.\r\n    Hollingsworth――Colonel George Gawler――“The Final Exodus”――Dr.\r\n    Thomas Clarke.\r\n\r\n\r\nA SERIOUS conflict broke out between England and Greece, and\r\nconsequently in England itself, in 1850. The cause was Lord\r\nPalmerston’s quarrel with the Greek Government, which had failed\r\nto protect _Don_ David Pacifico (1784‒1854), a Gibraltar Jew and a\r\nBritish subject, from the violence of the Athenian mob. The British\r\nfleet, under Admiral Sir William Parker (1817‒1866), was ordered to\r\nthe Piræus and seized a number of Greek ships to enforce compensation.\r\nA vote of censure upon this high-handed proceeding was moved and\r\ncarried by Lord Stanley¹ (1775‒1851) in the House of Lords. The\r\nmajority against the Government was thirty-seven. In the House of\r\nCommons Mr. J. A. Roebuck (1801‒1879) moved a counter-resolution,\r\nexpressing confidence in the Government, and Lord Palmerston defended\r\nhimself in a speech five hours long. He uttered upon that occasion the\r\ncelebrated phrase “Civis Romanus sum,” and declared that, wherever a\r\nBritish subject might be, the watching eye and the strong arm of\r\nEngland would protect him.\r\n\r\n    ¹ Edward (Smith-Stanley), Baron Stanley of Brokestaffe\r\n      (1832‒1851), thirteenth Earl of Derby, K.G. (1834‒1851).\r\n\r\nGladstone, on the other side, pointed out the dangers of this policy.\r\n“What, sir,” he asked, “was a Roman citizen? He was the member of a\r\nprivileged class; he belonged to a conquering race, to a nation that\r\nheld all others bound down by the strong arm of power. For him there\r\nwas to be an exceptional system of law, for him principles were to\r\nbe asserted, and by him rights were to be enjoyed that were denied to\r\nthe rest of the world. Is such the view of the noble lord as to the\r\nrelation which is to subsist between England and other countries?”\r\n\r\nSuch, at all events, was the view of the House of Commons, for Mr.\r\nRoebuck’s motion was carried by a majority of forty-six. However,\r\non both sides of the controversy, protection was considered as an\r\nobligation involving great and far-reaching responsibilities. This\r\nconflict gives us an idea of the difficulties with which the question\r\nof the protection of the Jews in the Ottoman Empire was beset.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of this memorable debate, which took place on June\r\n24th, 1850, [Sir Robert] Peel [Bart.] (1788‒1850), in a brief speech\r\nof singular eloquence and wisdom, expressed his “reluctant dissent”\r\nfrom the motion, and uttered his final caution against perverting\r\ndiplomacy, “the great engine used by civilized society for the purpose\r\nof maintaining peace, into a cause of hostility and war.”\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, the Opposition had no intention whatever of blaming\r\nthe Government for undertaking the protection of the Jews. There\r\nwas only a difference of attitude, not one of principle, between\r\nthe Palmerston Government and the Opposition. The Opposition became\r\nalarmed about the dangerous consequences which they thought likely\r\nto result from certain steps taken by the Government; the Government,\r\non the other hand, had to consider carefully every new scheme of\r\nprotection for the Jews, particularly after the conflict with Greece\r\nin the _Don_ Pacifico case.\r\n\r\nReviewing the whole period and all the petitions, projects and\r\nexperiments in connection with the colonization of Palestine by Jews,\r\nwe see that Great Britain’s protection was considered a “conditio\r\nsine qua non” for their success――at least as far as English Jews were\r\ninterested in the movement. It is the same idea which modern Zionism\r\nexpressed half a century later in the Basle Programme (1897) by\r\ndemanding the consent of the Powers in the form of a legal guarantee\r\nor public recognition. The formula was different; but the fundamental\r\nidea is the same. It means security. The “Civis Romanus” system of\r\nPalmerston, a Government which sends a fleet to demand satisfaction\r\nfor one protected Jew, was justly considered a sufficiently reliable\r\nguarantee of security. It is therefore quite clear that when the\r\nopponents of modern Zionism half a century later endeavoured to\r\ndraw a line between the old schemes and efforts on the one hand, and\r\npolitical Zionism on the other, apparently approving of the former and\r\nanathematizing the latter, they were merely playing with words, and\r\nhad no notion of the real facts.\r\n\r\nWhy did the plans for the Restoration of the Jews to Palestine remain\r\nunfulfilled? Was it through political changes, for want of preparation,\r\nor through the absence of adequate organization on the part of the\r\nJewish people? It is not our business to criticize the past. Let us\r\ndeal instead with the further development of the idea, which in fact\r\nwas never dropped, but, on the contrary, continually gained ground.\r\n\r\nIn 1844 it was proposed to encourage the settlement of the Jews in\r\nPalestine by giving them employment on the land. Lady Montefiore\r\nwrites in her journal:――\r\n\r\n“General satisfaction was expressed at the suggestion of a plan which\r\nmight enable them to obtain an honourable independence. Energy and\r\ntalent, they said, existed. Nothing was needed but protection and\r\nencouragement.” In another letter, referring to the same subject, she\r\nwrites:――“Our high-spirited nationality, under a judiciously exercised\r\nprotectorate, might be assisted to work out, in due time, its own\r\ncivilization, and to become a flourishing autonomous community with\r\nan extending commerce.”¹\r\n\r\n    ¹ Notes from a private journal of a visit to Egypt and\r\n      Palestine, by way of Italy and the Mediterranean.

His correspondence with the Chief\r\n_Rabbi_, Dr. Nathan Marcus Adler (1803‒1890) shows that this famous\r\nEcclesiastic was also greatly in sympathy with the idea (Appendix lvi).\r\n\r\nAt the same time the notion of establishing a Jewish Commonwealth\r\nfound ardent champions among another section of English-speaking Jews\r\nand among Christians of Puritan aspirations in America.\r\n\r\nMajor Mordecai Manuel Noah was one of the most prominent American Jews.\r\nHe was Consul of the United States to Morocco from 1813 to 1816. On\r\nhis return he established the _National Advent_ and afterwards the\r\n_New York Enquirer_, subsequently also a weekly paper, _The Times_.\r\nHe was Surveyor of the Port and Sheriff. In 1819 he published a book\r\nof his travels in England, France, Spain, and the Barbary States.\r\n\r\nHis attempt to establish a Jewish city of refuge on Grand Island, near\r\nBuffalo, is the one incident in his career that caused some sensation;\r\nbut there was a great deal more of interest in the Major’s life than\r\nthat famous episode. It would be a great pity indeed were the rest\r\nof his career allowed to pass into oblivion. Major Noah would have\r\ndeserved to be remembered had he never gone to Buffalo, and there\r\ndedicated the City of _Ararat_ in the Episcopal Church. It was on\r\nthe dedication of the _Shearith Israel_ Synagogue in New York City\r\nin 1818, seven years before the _Ararat_ episode, that Noah said:\r\n“The Jews will possess themselves once more of Syria, and take their\r\nrank among the governments of the earth.” Again, in 1844, nineteen\r\nyears after Ararat, he delivered a public discourse in New York, in\r\nwhich he expressed to an audience of Christians his firm belief in\r\nthe Restoration of Israel to the Promised Land. The tenacity with\r\nwhich Noah held to his Jewish nationalistic ideas is all the more\r\nremarkable in view of the fact that he was so thoroughly American. His\r\ngreat-great-grandfather, he said in one of the addresses referred to,\r\nwas buried in the Cemetery at Chatham Square. He himself was a great\r\nliterary and political personality in New York. It was said that he\r\ntold the best story, rounded the best sentence and wrote the best play\r\nof all his contemporaries. He was one of the most prominent editors of\r\nthe City. He held, at different times, the offices of Consul-General\r\nat Tunis, Sheriff of New York County, Surveyor of the Port, and Judge\r\nof the Court of Sessions. “No man of his day had a better claim to the\r\ntitle of ‘American,’ yet all his life he cherished the idea of a\r\nRestoration of the Jews to Palestine.”¹\r\n\r\n    ¹ M.

The Maccabean, New York, December. 1908, _p._ 231 f.\r\n\r\nIn 1845 he published a _Discourse on the Restoration of the Jews_,\r\ndelivered at the Tabernacle on October 28th and December 2nd, 1844. In\r\nthe Preface to his book he refers to some Christian supporters of the\r\nidea, and says:――\r\n\r\n“True, the efforts to evangelize them (the Jews) contrary, as I think,\r\nto the manifest predictions of the prophets, continue to be unceasing,\r\nyet even in this there is charity and good feeling, which cannot fail\r\nto be reciprocally beneficial.” He then quotes the letter of the late\r\nPresident of the United States, Mr. Adams, to which we referred above\r\n(see Chapter IX.), and draws the attention of the Americans to the\r\nidea of Restoration in most forcible and often eloquent language.\r\n\r\nAnother American, Warder Cresson (1798‒1860), United States Consul in\r\n_Jerusalem_, was a great Zionist in his time. He wrote a book¹ on the\r\nsubject, in which he says:――\r\n\r\n    ¹ Jerusalem――the centre and joy of the whole earth....

M.DCCC.XLIX., _p._ 3.\r\n\r\n“All the different nations have appointed consuls in _Jerusalem_, as\r\nin anticipation of some very important and general movement; which\r\nis regarded with a jealous eye by the Turks, as well as the other\r\nEuropean Powers. ‘Britain has had a consul in _Jerusalem_ three years\r\nbefore any other nation, except Prussia; but no sooner did she send\r\na bishop, than France, Russia and Austria sent consuls forthwith;\r\nand thus in _Jerusalem_――which is, in a commercial point of view,\r\nbut a paltry inland Eastern town, without trade or importance of any\r\nkind――sit the five consuls of the Great European powers (as well as\r\none appointed by the United States of America), looking at one another,\r\nand it is difficult to say why and wherefore.’ To use the words of Dr.\r\nAlexander Keith (1791‒1880): ‘A country which for previous centuries,\r\n_no man inquired after_, excites anew the liveliest interest among the\r\ngreatest of earthly potentates.’”¹\r\n\r\n    ¹ The Land of Israel....

He founded a colony in Palestine which was one of the\r\npioneer enterprises of its kind.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the propaganda in England made considerable progress. The\r\nRev. A. G. H. Hollingsworth aroused public opinion and appealed to the\r\nBritish Government for help for the Jews to regain the land of their\r\nfathers. He says:――\r\n\r\n“Such objects are worthy of the efforts of a great people. These\r\ndesigns are to be brought into maturity by the settlement and the\r\nprotection of the Jew in Palestine. It is his native climate and home.\r\nThere he can feel the deathless energies of his race, and the high\r\ndestinies of his future. He is poor, he is powerless, he is alone;\r\nscattered like iron amid the clay of surrounding nations. But let\r\nhim ask in peace for the common rights of a subject of Turkey, in a\r\ncountry where the very hills have voices to remind him of what he has\r\nbeen and may be; and under the protecting flag of Victoria, he will be\r\nable, divinely permitted, to prove himself possessed of heroic virtues\r\nin all that makes man great, noble, religious and free.”¹\r\n\r\n    ¹ Remarks upon the Present Condition and Future Prospects of\r\n      the Jews in Palestine.

She does\r\nnot require or wish for increase of territory――already has she (that\r\ndangerous boon) more direct dominion than she can easily maintain; but\r\nshe does _most urgently_ need the shortest and the safest lines of\r\ncommunication to the territories already possessed.... Egypt and Syria\r\nstand in intimate connection. A foreign hostile power mighty in either,\r\nwould soon endanger British trade and communications through the other.\r\nHence the providential call upon her, to exert herself energetically\r\nfor the amelioration of the condition of both of these Provinces.\r\nEgypt has improved greatly by British influence, and it is now for\r\nEngland to set her hand to the renovation of Syria, through the only\r\npeople whose energies will be extensively and permanently in the work,\r\n――the real children of the soil, the sons of _Israel_.”¹\r\n\r\n    ¹ Syria, and its near prospects; the substance of an Address\r\n      delivered ... on Tuesday, 25th January, 1853 ...

London:...\r\n      1854....\r\n\r\nDr. Thomas Clarke, author of _Palestine for the Jews_, wrote: “Any\r\none who has studied the features of the past, and watched intently the\r\nsigns of the present, can see that a terrible convulsion is coming;\r\nand if, out of the chaos, Poles, Huns, Magyars, Sclaves and Italians――\r\n... are to be resuscitated, is not also that nation through whom\r\nwe as Gentiles derive a title to our blessings, and whose ancestor,\r\nabove four thousand years ago, was the friend of God? And I, as an\r\nEnglishman, cannot blind myself to the fact that, while it would be\r\nan inestimable boon to the house of _Israel_, it would be also of the\r\ngreatest possible advantage to us; for if it has been a necessity in\r\ntimes past that the kingdom of Turkey shall exist as a neutral power,\r\nand that its boundaries should remain intact as a defence and barrier\r\n... surely, ... the occupation of Palestine by ... the Jews, under the\r\nprotection of England, must be a greater necessity than ever.... If\r\nEngland, again, is ... relying upon its commerce as the corner-stone\r\nof its greatness; if one of the nearest and best channels of that\r\ncommerce is across the axis of the three great continents; and if the\r\nJews are essentially a trading ... people, what so natural as that\r\nthey should be planted along that great highway of ancient traffic?\r\nIs not the mind struck with astonishment at the contemplation of such\r\na possibility? How the cycles of ages seem to be but the revolutions\r\nof the giant wheel of time, and how the past is but the seed ... of\r\nthe future,... For, in the realisation of what is certainly more than\r\na probability, the now almost forgotten and long buried cities of\r\nPalmyra, Babylon, Bagdad and especially of ancient Balsorah (_sic_),\r\nat the junction of the two great Eastern rivers――a position scarcely\r\nsecond to Constantinople itself,――must again become emporiums (_sic_)\r\nof wealth, and rise to a splendour and importance equal, or superior,\r\nto what they were in the acme of their glory.―― ... Syria must be\r\noccupied by a trading ... people――it lies in the great route of\r\nancient commerce; and were the Ottoman Power to be displaced, that old\r\ncommercial route would immediately re-open. Trade would flow once more\r\nin its old channel across Syria and along the valley of the Euphrates\r\n... and in what more skilful hands could the exchanges betwixt the\r\nEast and the West be placed? In his harbours would the ships of\r\nEurope discharge the fabrics and manufactures of the industrious\r\nWest, and return laden with the wine and oil, and silks and gems of\r\nthe East. In fine, Syria would be safe only in the hands of a brave,\r\nindependent, and spirited people, deeply imbued with the sentiment of\r\nnationality,... Such people we have in the Jews....

For Jews the question\r\nis satisfactorily answered by their instinct of sympathy. Lord\r\nBeaconsfield felt towards the members of his race as a Jew feels for\r\nhis fellow-Jews. That being the test, Lord Beaconsfield proved himself\r\na good Jew in that respect. In religious matters, however, Lord\r\nBeaconsfield was a Christian――and a Zionist.\r\n\r\nHe was purely Jewish by descent, and was the eldest son of Isaac\r\n_D’_Israeli (1766‒1848), the author of _The Curiosities of Literature_\r\n(1791), _The Genius of Judaism_ (1833), _etc._, by his wife Miriam\r\n(Maria), a daughter of Naphtali (_d._ 1808) _de_ Solomon Basevi of\r\nVerona, Italy. He was born in London on Friday, 21 December, 1804,\r\nand was initiated into the _Abrahamic_ covenant on the following\r\nFriday, 26 _Tebet_, 5565, by David Abarbanel Lindo (1772‒1852).\r\nIsaac _D’_Israeli severed his connection finally with the Bevis\r\nMarks synagogue in March, 1817, and on the 31 July following, at the\r\ninstigation it is said of Samuel Rogers (1763‒1855), the banker poet,\r\nthe future Premier was baptised at the parish church of St. Andrew,\r\nHolborn. In his public conduct and pronouncements he proved undeniably\r\nthat an Englishman, by birth a Jew, can be as much an Englishman as\r\nany descendant of Saxon, Norman, or Dane living in these islands, and\r\ncan share with as warm a glow the common sentiment of patriotism that\r\nunites Englishmen round their ancient throne and institutions.\r\n\r\nDisraeli was a living monument of the greatness of the Jewish race,\r\nof its capacity to produce individuals equal in mental stature to\r\nthe loftiest among mankind. What he thought of his ancestral and of\r\nhis adopted faith respectively may be gathered from the well-known\r\nwords in one of his earlier writings: “Christianity is Judaism for\r\nthe multitude,” a sentence which to his brethren in race is equivalent\r\nto saying: “Ye are the salt of the earth.” The perseverance and zeal\r\nwhich acknowledged no defeat and produced such extraordinary successes\r\nwere essentially Jewish. The most superficial acquaintance with Jews\r\nis sufficient to reveal the fact that there is no Jewish trait more\r\ndistinctive than this unconquerable determination. It is a heritage\r\nbequeathed to them by their ancestors. With the many different\r\nexperiences of a race dispersed in every corner of the globe, without\r\na home for nearly twenty centuries, hunted from country to country,\r\ncarrying their lives in their hands, and bound to be on the alert for\r\nevery emergency, it is not strange that the Jews display great\r\nresourcefulness.\r\n\r\nThe Disraeli family had been expelled by the persecutions of the\r\nSpanish Inquisition, in the fifteenth century, and found an asylum\r\nin Italy. Two centuries and a half later, Benjamin (1730‒1816) [_de_\r\nIsaac] Israeli of Cento, in Ferrara, Italy, grandfather of the Earl\r\nof Beaconsfield, settled in England. Thus the experience stored in the\r\nmind of a typical Jew like Beaconsfield represents more than a single\r\ntrait of heredity; it is a combination of such traits. But what was\r\nmost Jewish in him was his affection for the Holy Land. This pious\r\nfeeling, which he shared with his race, became with him a tremendous\r\npower; it influenced his policy and caused him to consolidate\r\nEngland’s power in the East. He also constantly supported every\r\nmovement towards Jewish emancipation.\r\n\r\nAs a historic figure he possesses a charm of his own, and romanticism\r\npervades his whole career. Neither his birth nor the religion of his\r\nancestors nor his own antecedents prevented him from conquering the\r\nprejudices which the aristocracy is wont to show towards a self-made\r\nman; for the English aristocracy possesses the wonderful quality that\r\nensures the preservation of its strength――that if once it recognizes\r\ngenius, far from opposing or avoiding it, it defends it, attracts\r\nit, and completely absorbs it. And so Disraeli, instead of becoming\r\na fiery tribune of the masses, developed into an able and successful\r\nleader of the aristocracy. This man, whom his opponents had abused as\r\na foreigner, so conducted himself as finally to become one of\r\nEngland’s most famous champions.\r\n\r\nIt was no common energy and perseverance that Benjamin Disraeli needed\r\nto climb to fame as he did. It was a continuous struggle for him,\r\nfrom the time when, hooted by the Whig majority in Parliament, he\r\nretorted that the day would come when they would hear him, to the time\r\nwhen the great Conservative Party chose him as its leader and he was\r\nacclaimed by all his countrymen. Without inheriting a fortune in this\r\ncountry――where wealth and birth had always been, if not altogether\r\nindispensable, at least a most important qualification for admission\r\nto public life――he was yet able to overcome obstacles that were\r\nthen deemed insurmountable and to attain by sheer force of his own\r\nunconquerable will to a position that powers unfathomable seemed\r\njoined to prevent him from gaining. By race a Jew, he was at bottom\r\na clear-sighted sceptic. With remarkable foresight he had been\r\nable to weigh the advantage which, from the point of view of a\r\nCabinet Minister, he could gain from the position offered him by the\r\nConservative party. No one foresaw more clearly than he the future\r\nin store for it. As a Jew he also knew well that it was impossible\r\nto prevent the Liberal evolution from being slowly accomplished in\r\nEngland. Instead of declaring war upon Liberalism he compromised with\r\nit, and, by means of concessions cleverly granted at the right moment,\r\nhe contrived to concede only a portion of what public opinion demanded.\r\nHis tendencies, however, were democratic, and in an age in which greed\r\nfor material advancement was levelling all things to the lowest plane,\r\nhe was able to rescue England from a grovelling servility to blatant\r\ncommercialism, uplift her soul and rouse her to a recognition of the\r\nfact that ephemeral interests are not everything to a great people.\r\n\r\nAs Premier he showed Europe that “England was something more than\r\na counting-house.” He obtained possession of the Suez Canal by the\r\npurchase of shares――a transaction in which he was assisted by the late\r\nLord Rothschild (Appendix lviii).\r\n\r\nHe placed the Imperial Crown of India on his Sovereign’s head. Without\r\nfiring a shot, he took possession of Cyprus (Appendix lix), and caused\r\nthe might of British arms to be felt in every continent.\r\n\r\nHis genius, with its many interesting characteristics, was perceived\r\nlong before his abilities in international statesmanship and diplomacy\r\nbecame known. But as a man of letters, no less than as a statesman,\r\nhe was first of all a son of his race (Appendix lx) and a Zionist.\r\nHis speeches and writings were never those of a renegade anxious to\r\nvilify the faith he had forsaken, or to condemn the ancestry from\r\nwhich he had sprung. There never was a Jew who wrote in more glowing\r\nterms of the greatness of the Jewish race. No Jew has borne more\r\nfervid testimony to the sublimity of the religion by which the Jewish\r\npeople has been sustained through all persecutions. No one could\r\nhave used more persuasive arguments, or adopted wiser measures to\r\nremove restrictions from which the Jews were suffering. He had a\r\ndeeply-rooted respect and love for his ancient people and for its\r\nancient land.\r\n\r\nTo restore the Jews to their rightful place in the esteem of the world,\r\nhe wrote and spoke and toiled (Appendix lxi). For this he imperilled\r\nthe prospects of his own career. For this he was content to expose\r\nhimself to the scoffs and gibes of opponents who almost to his\r\nlast hour never forgave him the “crime” of being a Jew. He held the\r\nfirm belief that “the Lord still fights for _Israel_.” Unlike those\r\ndegenerate sons of _Israel_, who are ever eager to conceal what should\r\nbe a source of honour to them, he was never ashamed of his origin:\r\nand when taunted with being of common extraction he would maintain\r\nthat his ancestors were already noble when those of the proudest\r\naristocracy in the world were still barbarians, roaming helplessly\r\nabout the woods.\r\n\r\nAlthough he was educated in the bosom of the Christian Church, his\r\nheart never ceased to beat for the greatness and to feel for the\r\nsufferings of the Jewish nation, to which he belonged by the blood in\r\nhis veins and the honoured name he bore. Wherever there was a struggle\r\nfor the rights of Jews in matters that concerned their honour and\r\nwell-being, wherever there was a fight for truth and uprightness,\r\nthere we see him stand――a conqueror. While so many authors made it\r\ntheir business to depict the dark side of the Jewish character or\r\nhistory, he used his gifted pen to show the worthier traits of the\r\nJewish character and the influence of the Jews in the world.\r\n\r\nAs a writer Lord Beaconsfield was essentially an Oriental. Even the\r\ntales in which he describes the clubs and drawing-rooms of London are\r\nlike an Arabian Nights’ entertainment transplanted to St. James’. Over\r\npersons and scenes he casts an Oriental magnificence. His Oriental\r\ntales are, to our mind, the most natural that he wrote.\r\n\r\n_The wonderful tale of Alroy_ (1833)¹ is an Oriental romance founded\r\non a _Hebrew_ tradition concerning the Princes of the Captivity\r\n――rulers whom the Jews continued to elect from among the descendants\r\nof the House of _David_ (2854‒2924 _a.m._) even after their dispersion.\r\nAlroy is one of them,² who after a long interregnum possesses himself,\r\nby supernatural assistance, of a part of the sceptre of _Solomon_\r\n(_ob._ 2964), and establishes the _Hebrew_ monarchy on the ruins of\r\nthe new Caliphate of Bagdad. His life is short, and his reign much\r\nshorter. The tale is full of enthusiasm for the hopes of _Israel_.\r\nOne little passage may be cited: “All was silent: alone the _Hebrew_\r\nprince stood, amid the regal creation of the Macedonian captains.\r\nEmpires and dynasties flourish and pass away; the proud metropolis\r\nbecomes a solitude, the conquering kingdom even a desert: but _Israel_\r\nstill remains, still a descendant of the most ancient kings.”\r\n\r\n      ¹‏ חטר מגזע ישי או אל־ראי מאת ... בנימין בנימין דיזראעלי ... ונעתק לשפת עברית צחה ע״י\r\n              .אברהם אבא ראקאווסקי ... ווראשא ... שנת תרמ״ג לפ״ק ... 1883\r\n\r\n    ² David Alroy, or Alrui (El David: Menahem _ben_ Suleiman\r\n      ibn Alruhi), born at Amadia in Kurdistan. He appeared as\r\n      a pseudo-messiah about the year 1160.\r\n\r\nA biographer of Disraeli remarks on this passage: “This (with its\r\nafter-irony of ‘Alroy’s seizure by the Kourdish bandits’) may be\r\ncompared with the satire in which Disraeli encountered Mr. [Charles\r\nNewdigate] Newdegate’s [M.P.] (1816‒1887) appeals to ‘prophecy’:...\r\nThey have survived the Pharaohs, they have survived the Cæsars, they\r\nhave survived the Antonines and Seleucidæ, and I think they will\r\nsurvive the arguments of the right honourable member....” Mr. Morley\r\ntells that (1838‒1918)¹ Mr. Gladstone said that Disraeli asserted that\r\nonly those nations that behaved well to the Jews prospered....²\r\n\r\n    ¹ Afterwards Viscount (1908‒) Morley of Blackburn.\r\n\r\n    ² Disraeli: A Study in Personality and Ideas, by Walter Sichel\r\n      ... London, 1904, _p._ 223.\r\n\r\nDisraeli loved the East, and particularly Palestine. Its\r\npicturesqueness, both in scenery and in history, fascinated him.\r\n\r\n“Say what they like,” says Herbert in _Venetia_, “there is a spell in\r\nthe shores of the Mediterranean Sea which no others can rival. Never\r\nwas such a union of natural loveliness and magical associations!\r\nOn these shores have risen all that interests us in the past――Egypt\r\nand Palestine, Greece, Rome and Carthage, Moorish Spain and feudal\r\nItaly. These shores have yielded us our religion, our arts, our\r\nliterature and our laws. If all that we have gained from the shores\r\nof the Mediterranean was erased from the memory of man, we should be\r\nsavages.”¹\r\n\r\n    ¹ _Ibid._ Note 1.\r\n\r\nThe great merit of _Tancred_ (1847)¹ lies in the description of Syria,\r\nand of life in the mountain and desert, in which it abounds. Tancred\r\nis a high-born youth dissatisfied with modern society, yearning for\r\nthe restoration of true faith, and resolving to visit the land in\r\nwhich the Creator had conversed with man, as the only spot in which it\r\nis at all likely that enlightenment or inspiration will be vouchsafed\r\nto him. The story of his adventures is told with wonderful spiritual\r\nbeauty. The author leads his reader to the desert, the cradle of the\r\nArabs, from which they spread East and West, and come to be known as\r\nMoors in Spain, as Jews in Palestine. Nothing can be more interesting\r\nthan his account of the manners and the men, neither of which are\r\nmuch changed since the days of the Patriarchs; nothing finer than the\r\npictures of the rocks and towers of _Jerusalem_, or the grey forests\r\nof _The Lebanon_.\r\n\r\n    ¹‏ נס לגוים או טאנקרעד מאת בנימן דיזראעלי  ... נעתק עברית מאת יהל״ל ...

He\r\nbelieved in the glory of Great Britain’s imperial mission, and was\r\ninterested to the bottom of his heart in the past history and future\r\nwelfare of her venerable and still vigorous institutions. He was\r\nanxious to see the influence of Great Britain strong and decisive in\r\nthe East. His policy on the Eastern question was constantly ascribed\r\nby his enemies to his “Semitic instincts,” which were supposed to\r\ntaint his views of the relations between Turkey and all her Christian\r\nsubjects. But they could know little of Beaconsfield who supposed that\r\nhis Semitic instincts led him to any partiality. What guided him was\r\nhis deep conception of Great Britain’s policy and highest interests,\r\nworking in conjunction and in harmony with his feeling for the real\r\nEast, for the Jews, the Semites, for Judaism in its idealism and\r\nOriental beauty. The conditions were not yet ripe for practical\r\nprogress in Zionism, but he was throughout an enthusiastic supporter\r\nof the Zionist idea, and he worked for the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\n                           THE CRIMEAN WAR\r\n\r\n    Russia and Turkey――A protectorate over the Greek Christians\r\n    ――The question of the “Holy Places”――The Greek Church――_Sultan_\r\n    Mahmud II. and the _Tsar_ Nicholas I.――Jurisdiction in Turkey\r\n    ――_Prince_ Menschikoff――The Alliance between France, Great\r\n    Britain and Turkey――Sardinia――Alexander II.――The fall of\r\n    Sebastopol――The conclusion of peace in Paris――The question\r\n    of reforms――The Jewish point of view――The Crimean War\r\n    and Palestine――Dr. Benisch in the _Jewish Chronicle_――The\r\n    Christian Zionist propaganda――Rev.

Johnstone――Mr. Robert\r\n    Young.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN 1853 a great struggle broke out between Russia and Turkey,\r\nthe immediate cause of which was the desire of Russia to force a\r\nprotectorate upon the Greek Christians in the Turkish dominions. This\r\nwas accompanied by a dispute between Russia and other European powers,\r\nespecially France, which had arisen over the guardianship of the\r\n“Holy Places.” The fate of Palestine was involved in the issue of\r\nthis struggle.\r\n\r\nThe pretension of the Greek Church to exercise the right of possession\r\nof the “Holy Places” dates back to the early days of Christianity.\r\nThe Greek Church has always posed as the genuine representative of\r\nthe Eastern Church, professing to have inherited its claim to the\r\nallegiance of the orthodox when the cleavage came, in the second\r\ncentury, concerning the proper season for the celebration of Easter,\r\nand divided its community into two distinct sections.\r\n\r\nThe alleged and proved purpose of the Church was to obtain complete\r\nand undisturbed possession of the “Holy Places,” where the Greek\r\nChurch deems it of vital importance that certain religious ceremonies\r\nshall be observed, to which pilgrimages are to be made by its devout\r\nmembers. Some of these members furnished the Russian Government with\r\nreasons for its claims, presumably based on facts. At that period the\r\ngreater part of the Christian Communities in the whole of Syria and\r\nPalestine adhered to the Greek Orthodox faith. In the whole Ottoman\r\nEmpire their number was very considerable; the estimate in 1852‒53\r\nreached as high a total as 11,000,000 members of the Greek Church.\r\nIn Greece it was the established religion, while throughout the\r\nGreek islands its members outnumbered those of any other Christian\r\ndenomination. North of the Danube, Wallachia and Moldavia were under\r\nits sway and were considered to be under the protection of Russia.\r\n\r\nThe Greek monasteries of the Holy Land were not only under the\r\nprotection and control of Russia, but were chiefly supported by loans\r\nfrom that country. Under this influence these communities continued\r\nto make the greatest progress possible, and put forth every effort to\r\nadvance themselves step by step, leaving no stone unturned in their\r\nendeavour to raise themselves above the other Churches.\r\n\r\nRumours gained currency that a strong Russian propaganda was on foot.\r\nIt was even said that the late _Sultan_ Mahmud II. gave an assurance\r\nto the effect, that at the death of Mehemet Ali, the Holy Land should\r\nbe given up to Russian dominion on certain stipulated conditions.\r\nImagination had, of course, free scope in inventing myths of this kind.\r\nBut at any rate there was a general impression abroad that Russia was\r\nanxious to conquer and annex the Holy Land.\r\n\r\nThe unhappy empire for which England and France had shed so much blood\r\nand made so many sacrifices continued to give anxiety and trouble\r\nto Europe. Turkey had gained much by the war in the way of security\r\nfrom invasion and extension of the central authority to provinces\r\nwhich previously had been partly independent. The Western Powers, and\r\nparticularly England, waited anxiously for the reforms and progress\r\nwhich were promised by the sanguine friends of the Turkish cause.\r\nBut Turkey did nothing. Her finances were in confusion. The schemes\r\nwhich English enterprise had kept going were delayed. While the Porte\r\nwas borrowing at enormous interest the money required for current\r\nexpenditure, it could hardly be expected to guarantee dividends on\r\nmany millions sterling, and it would have inspired little confidence\r\nif it had done so. This, then, was the time for statesmen to study the\r\nquestion and to elaborate their plans.\r\n\r\nOf all the evils with which the Turkish State was afflicted,\r\ncorruption――in the sense of the denial of justice――seems to have been\r\nthe worst. Each of the non-Mohammedan nations was permitted to appear\r\nbefore tribunals of its own bishops in matters of litigation in which\r\nonly its members were concerned. The civil law was administered in the\r\nGreek courts; the Armenians were subject to many regulations brought\r\nfrom the interior of Asia. The Turkish courts were presided over\r\nby functionaries who had much of the character of priests, and the\r\nlaw founded on the Koran was what might have been expected from a\r\ntext-book interpreted by such commentators. The literal sense meant\r\none thing, the metaphorical sense another, and the best chance of\r\ngetting justice was when the judge could find nothing to fit the case\r\nand decided according to his own common sense. Both his Scriptural\r\nauthorities and his private opinions were, however, continually\r\ninfluenced by arguments more persuasive than any pleadings. The\r\ncorruption of this sort of court was notorious, and the Christian\r\nbishops were not considered much better than the believers. As for\r\nthe _Frank_¹ jurisdiction, it was chaos, being void of all system.\r\nEach man came under the representative of his own nation; through\r\nthis official or his deputy he had to be sued, and by him he had to\r\nbe tried for any offence. If a French officer and a German shoemaker\r\nhad differences concerning a pair of boots, one had to make his\r\napplication through the Austrian Internunciate, the other had to\r\nrespond through the French Embassy. The matter was in the first\r\ninstance referred to the Consuls, who knew little of law, and the\r\nappeal came before the Ambassadors, who knew less. Commercial courts\r\nexisted in some of the chief cities, and exercised a good influence;\r\nbut as the country was opened more and more to commercial enterprise,\r\nand this increased with the progress of the non-Mohammedan populations,\r\nthese courts became inadequate.\r\n\r\n    ¹ European.\r\n\r\nThe country was, no doubt, very badly in need of material improvements:\r\nroads and canals are generally the initial work of a renewed\r\ncivilization. But the real basis of improvement is confidence in the\r\nGovernment, and the guarantee of undisturbed ownership of property.\r\nSuch confidence cannot exist without impartial courts and sensible\r\nlaws. The most capable judge could not do justice according to the\r\n_Koran_, while the codes of Justinian and Napoleon were unavailing so\r\nlong as the longest purse was the best argument.\r\n\r\nIt was therefore the duty of the Western Powers to consider how\r\njustice might be administered so as to encourage both the native and\r\nthe settler to join in the work of amelioration. Few thinking men\r\nhad visited the East without formulating some plan for supplying\r\nthis first and greatest want. The general conclusion was based on\r\nthe supposition of the necessity for continuing the “Capitulations.”\r\nIt was supposed to be impossible for strangers to submit themselves\r\nto the authority of the monarch who ruled the land; and indeed the\r\nexperience of the native courts, and the fact that no man ventured\r\nto undertake any commercial business without security, naturally\r\nsuggested foreign protection. More than one traveller, therefore,\r\nrecommended that a code of laws should be agreed to by the Great\r\nPowers, and that in every seaport French, English, _etc._, judges\r\nshould decide such cases as involved the liberty or property of\r\nEuropeans. Such a system was regarded as being superior to the earlier\r\nineffective regulations. But, on the other hand, it was held that such\r\nan expedient should only be resorted to temporarily.\r\n\r\nTurkey had already suffered greatly through the power of European\r\nEmbassies and their enmity towards one another. The Western Powers\r\ndid not forget that they had gone to war for the independence and\r\nintegrity of the Ottoman Empire. They knew that a mixed court sitting\r\nin its capital to try foreigners was a thing that no high-spirited\r\nnation would permit, and that, if circumstances made it necessary\r\nto demand jurisdiction for foreigners in the capital of the Sultan,\r\nthat could only be until the elements of a better state of things\r\ncame into being. The Powers had, therefore, to look forward to a time\r\nwhen Turkey would stand alone, and all protection and jurisdiction in\r\nthe way of Capitulations would cease to exist. A well-framed code of\r\nlaws suited to all races and religions, administered by well-educated\r\nmen, and obeyed by native and foreigner alike, was the ideal object\r\nfor which the supporters of Turkey had to work. The sovereign of the\r\ncountry must be at the head of this system and supreme in his own\r\ndominions. Although such a scheme was deemed visionary at that time,\r\nand the gap had to be filled by “mixed” courts, yet public opinion\r\nin England thought that nothing should be done that could prevent the\r\nsubsequent establishment of the better system. It was also believed\r\nthat if a suitable legal system were set up, men might be found in\r\nEngland, France and other countries to administer it successfully.\r\nBut it was admitted on all hands that the judicial system of\r\nTurkey deserved the immediate attention of thinking politicians;\r\nthat questions of taxation and the tenure of land were especially\r\ninteresting in view of the increasing commerce with the East and of\r\npossible developments in the matter of immigration; that nothing that\r\ncould throw light on the causes of Turkish decay should be neglected;\r\nand that the absence of good laws and security was the first obstacle\r\nto improvement, and should therefore be the first thought of the\r\nstatesman and philanthropist.\r\n\r\nHere we see all the elements of the political Zionist problem. All\r\nthis development prepared the way for the idea of the protection of\r\nthe Jews in the East, and gave a powerful stimulus to projects for the\r\ncolonization of Palestine by the Jews.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1853 the Russian Government submitted to the Porte,\r\nthrough _Prince_ A. S. Menschikoff (1787‒1869), an ultimatum in regard\r\nto the Greek Christians and other matters. England and France prepared\r\nto support _Sultan_ Abdul Medjid against Russia, and stationed their\r\nfleets in Bezika Bay. In July the Russian forces advanced into the\r\nDanubian principalities. On October 4th, 1853, Turkey declared war.\r\nThe English and French fleets thereupon passed through the Dardanelles.\r\nOn March 12th, 1854, France and Great Britain concluded an alliance\r\nwith Turkey, and two weeks later they declared war against Russia.\r\nAt the beginning of October the Allies began the regular siege of\r\nSebastopol. Sardinia joined the Allies in January, 1855. Meanwhile the\r\n_Emperor_ Nicholas I. died,¹ and Alexander II. acceded to the throne.\r\nOn November 8th Sebastopol fell into the hands of the Allies.\r\n\r\n    ¹ Feb. 18, 1855 [_o.s._].\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Western Powers completed the occupation of Turkey within two\r\nyears; but the reforms, of which they spoke so much, were still to\r\ncome. Turkey remained what it was in internal rule and mismanagement.\r\nFear may have controlled the abuses of fanaticism, despair may have\r\ndestroyed whatever remained of national pride; but the abuses which\r\nages had fostered still prevailed. Now the social regeneration of the\r\nOttoman State was part of the legitimate policy of the Western Powers.\r\nThe presence of large foreign armies had broken down the pride of\r\nthe Mussulmans, or enforced its concealment; the Sultan, though less\r\nexposed to the vagaries of diplomatists, had become more responsible\r\nto the European States and the brotherhood of sovereigns among whom he\r\nnow held a place; the Turk himself, in spite of courage and a certain\r\namount of dignity, was degenerating day by day, through want of modern\r\nculture; the Christian tribes were increasing in numbers and power;\r\nthe merchants of Constantinople, Smyrna, and Alexandria were growing\r\nrich with British gold, while British enterprise seemed to be surely,\r\nthough gradually, adding the Sultan’s empire to the area of its wide\r\nactivities.\r\n\r\nJustice, humanity, England’s promises, the arguments with which\r\nshe had opposed her enemies, demanded that her tutelage should not\r\nsuddenly cease. She and France were now the protectors of the Ottoman\r\nterritory and its outlying provinces; they were the masters of every\r\nmilitary position; every sea was traversed by their fleets; every\r\nport was full of the merchandize required for their vast armies. Nor\r\nwas their supremacy one of force alone. Whatever may have been the\r\nfeelings aroused by their policy, each class and creed had learned to\r\nrespect their motives and to acquiesce in their presence. Whatever may\r\nhave been thought on racial and religious grounds, certainly material\r\ninterests in the end prevailed over every other. Every business man\r\nsaw clearly that his own prosperity was enhanced by the presence\r\nof two wealthy nations, in need of large and constant supplies, and\r\nwilling to pay liberally and at once. In their hearts they had no wish\r\nto be again reduced to a miserable traffic with their own bankrupt\r\nGovernment, or with the poverty-stricken towns of the Turkish and\r\nPersian interior. The peasants who tilled the ground had gained\r\nwherever local tyranny did not rob them of the just rewards of their\r\nlabour. The landed proprietor had also become wealthy, and had no\r\nreason to regret the Western crusade, which gave his possessions a\r\nfourfold value. So tangible was the advantage, and so soon did the\r\nTurks acquiesce in what affected only their patriotism and self-esteem,\r\nthat it was doubtful whether even the most bigoted Mussulman wanted\r\nthe evacuation of the country by the Allied armies. Englishmen,\r\nof course, looked upon the advancement of Turkey in a different\r\nlight from that in which it was seen by its own people. Still, even\r\nEnglishmen could not fail to realize that if they withdrew there was\r\nno doubt that the old stagnation would immediately return, and that\r\nit would even become worse than before, for old fame and the habit of\r\ncommand kept the Mussulman in his pre-eminence, while the “_Rajah_”\r\nwas accustomed to obey, and the foreigner was a mere sojourner,\r\nwho cared for nothing but his own peace and prosperity. Now all was\r\nchanged: the Turk was still master, without the authority to rule;\r\nthe Christian was without rights, but had felt his power; while every\r\ncountry had its adventurers or capitalists in the land, each with his\r\nown scheme launched or prospective, and all agreeing in the demand\r\nthat this rich land should no longer be the heritage of sloth and\r\nfatuity.\r\n\r\nPeace was signed at Paris――where a Congress of the Powers had been in\r\nsession――on March 30th, 1856. The integrity of the Ottoman Empire was\r\nguaranteed by the Powers; reforms were promised by the Sultan; Russia\r\nrenounced her protectorate over the Danubian principalities, and ceded\r\na strip of Bessarabia to Moldavia; the Black Sea was neutralized. The\r\nCongress united in the “Declaration of Paris,” which laid down some\r\nprinciples of international law.\r\n\r\nThe question in which the Jews were interested was first of all that\r\nof their position in Palestine, as well as in the whole of the Turkish\r\nEmpire. According to the wording of the treaty the Jews were excluded\r\nfrom the general guarantee and the immunities of the “_Rajahs_” under\r\nthe protection of the contracting powers. But, on the other hand,\r\nall the rights hitherto granted by the _Sultan_ to his Christian\r\nsubjects had been extended to the Jews as well; and it was clear\r\nthat, if Turkey understood her position rightly, this would also be\r\nher future policy, seeing that it was in her interest not to create\r\ndissatisfaction among a large and loyal body by refusing to one\r\nsection of non-Mohammedans what had been conceded to another, and thus\r\nalienating the only non-Mohammedan section of the population which did\r\nnot entertain sentiments of revenge, and the only section which was\r\ncapable of neutralizing any possible machinations on the part of other\r\nsections.\r\n\r\nThe war having on the one hand raised very considerably the prices of\r\nprovisions, and on the other hand cut off the supplies obtained by the\r\nPalestinian Jews in times of peace from those countries in which the\r\nmasses of Jews reside, an awful famine broke out in the Holy Land, and\r\naffected most severely all those who had hitherto depended for their\r\nlivelihood upon the small pittances doled out to them by the Jews\r\nin foreign countries. A pitiable cry of distress was raised in the\r\nEast and resounded throughout the Western world. Now the right time\r\nhad arrived. “We find”, wrote Dr. Abraham Benisch¹ (1811‒1878), “no\r\nother parallel in Jewish history to it save that offered by some of\r\nthe events narrated in the books of _Ezra_ (_fl._ 3413 _a.m._) and\r\n_Nehemiah_ (_fl._ 3426 _a.m._). The generous Abdul-Medjed has his\r\nprototype in the God-fearing _Cyrus_ (_ob._ 529 _b.c.e._); and the\r\npious affection for brethren and country, the devotion and patriotism\r\nthen kindling in the bosoms of patriots on the shores of the Euphrates\r\nhave transferred their seat to the banks of the Thames. So far God’s\r\nblessing had rested upon the work. But Rome was not built in a day,\r\nnor is a nation regenerated within a few years.”\r\n\r\n    ¹ _Jewish Chronicle_, March 21, 1856, _p._ 524.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, the reference here was to the regeneration of the\r\nJewish nation in Palestine. But for this purpose safety and full\r\nsecurity were wanted――the very problem with which modern Zionism was\r\nconfronted, and which was answered by the Basle programme of 1897.\r\n“The Jew, it is true, may now sow and plant. But will he also be\r\npermitted to reap? Will not the wild son of the desert trample down\r\nand carry off the crop even before it is ripe for the sickle? The\r\n_Sultan_ may emancipate his Jewish subjects in the Holy Land, but,\r\nin order to be enabled to reap any benefit from the boon conceded, he\r\nmust give them a government strong enough to protect life and property.\r\nThe mighty arm of justice must repress lawlessness and strike down\r\nthe wrong-doer.... Will the Porte as easily be able to establish in\r\nPalestine a strong government as it was to bless her with liberal\r\ninstitutions? This is another question which time, and time alone, can\r\nanswer, and yet upon the reply thereto the success of the agricultural\r\nscheme for the Palestinian Jews must depend entirely.”\r\n\r\nNo doubt 1856 offered a great opportunity, had the legal guarantees\r\nbeen available and the Jews prepared. Unfortunately these essential\r\nconditions did not yet obtain at that time, and no practical result\r\nwas achieved.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. William Henry Johnstone, Chaplain of Addiscombe, and an\r\nauthor of several theological works, preached the Restoration of\r\n_Israel_ to the Holy Land:――\r\n\r\n“If political events are hastening a crisis, when it may be desirable\r\nto consider what is to be done with Palestine, it behoves the Jews\r\nto take earnest heed to their duty.... It is not an extravagant\r\nsupposition that Palestine may be placed within the grasp of its\r\nancient owners....” “In one matter I feel that the Jews have just\r\nreason to complain of many Christians. The Divine Law, of which they\r\nhave been the guardians, has never been repealed. Jehovah gave it,\r\nand Jehovah has never taken it away.” “For the present I waive all\r\nconsideration of Scriptural predictions. But, without any reference to\r\nthe Bible, it must be clear to all that the residence of _Israel_ in\r\nthe Holy Land would be fraught with the greatest blessings to mankind.\r\nThe Jews, though now scattered over the entire habitable globe,\r\nare united by every national tie,... They have connections with all\r\nlarge towns; they possess the moving spring of modern industry and\r\nenterprise; and they are renowned for vigour and intelligence. They\r\nhave that gift, also, which no other nation had since the dispersion\r\nof Babel,――they can converse with all people in their own languages.\r\nThey have naturally, what the apostolic Christians received by\r\nmiraculous interposition, the gift of tongues. They may, therefore,\r\nnot only undo the work of Babel, but may carry on the work of the\r\napostles.”¹\r\n\r\n    ¹ Israel in the World: or, The Mission of the Hebrews to the\r\n      great military monarchies.

The idea existed in greater\r\nor less degree wherever Englishmen thought seriously about the Eastern\r\nproblem; it was a flame which was never extinguished.\r\n\r\nColonel Charles Henry Churchill (1814‒1877), a grandson of the fifth\r\nDuke of Marlborough (1766‒1840), was a staff officer in the British\r\nExpedition to Syria, and wrote one of the best works in English\r\nabout _The Lebanon_ and its inhabitants. In the “Preface” to which he\r\nwrites:――\r\n\r\n“The genius of England, which seems so peculiarly fitted to lead\r\nand govern the populations of the East, has, by the happily-combined\r\ninfluence of arms, commerce, and legislation, established in that\r\nquarter of the globe, a dominion which no purely military conqueror\r\ncould ever have consolidated, much less upheld and sustained.”\r\n\r\n“The development of the capabilities and resources of that\r\nunparalleled empire in the East, over which England presides――and that\r\nwithout a rival or compeer――has thus become essentially necessary to\r\nher national prosperity, it may be to her national existence, and must\r\never possess imperative, though not exclusive claims upon her national\r\nfeelings and sympathies.”\r\n\r\n“I say not exclusive and advisedly; for the East, to an important\r\nportion of which I now invite public attention,――the East, whose\r\nshores are washed by the Mediterranean Sea,――the East of rock-hewn\r\ncities and colossal tombs, of heavenly poesy and gigantic art, of\r\nJacob’s (2108‒2255 _a.m._) might and Ishmael’s (_b._ 2034 _a.m._)\r\nwandering power, of David’s lyre and of Isaiah’s (_fl._ 3140\r\n_a.m._) strain, of Abraham’s faith and Immanuel’s love,――where God’s\r\nmysterious ways with man begun, and where in the fulness of time they\r\nare to be accomplished,――this East, which may yet become the seat\r\nand centre of the Universal Reign!――it also has claims on England’s\r\nwatchful vigilance and sympathizing care....”\r\n\r\nAfter having so forcibly expounded the sentimental side, the author\r\nstrikes another note, in addition to that so eloquently struck by\r\nDisraeli and others:――\r\n\r\n“Whatever part England may take in the temporary complication of\r\naffairs which will probably ensue on that mighty consummation, which\r\nthe timid dictates of diplomacy would defer, but which the urgent\r\ndemands of humanity and civilization would fain accelerate, it must,\r\nfor obvious reasons, be clear to every English mind, that if England’s\r\nOriental supremacy is to be upheld, Syria and Egypt must be made to\r\nfall more or less under her sway or influence.”\r\n\r\nHe argues then as a military expert:――\r\n\r\n“Napoleon declared Acre to be the key to the East, and most correctly\r\ndid his military genius appreciate the importance of that land into\r\nwhich he vainly sought to enter, as a basis of operations against our\r\nIndian Empire.... I call upon my countrymen, therefore, to adopt this\r\npolitical doctrine, and nail it to the National Colours:――That when\r\nPalestine ceases to be Turkish, it must either become English, or else\r\nform part of a new independent State, which without the incentives\r\nto territorial aggrandizement, or the means of military aggression,\r\nshall yet be able to maintain its own honour and dignity, and more\r\nespecially to promote the great object for which it will be called\r\ninto existence, for which indeed, by its geographical position it will\r\nbe so eminently qualified; that of creating, developing and upholding\r\na commercial intercourse in the East, which shall draw together\r\nand unite the hitherto divergent races of mankind in the humanizing\r\nrelations of fraternity and peace....”\r\n\r\n“... the time is probably fast approaching when Syria, instead of\r\nbeing merely the land of dreamy and luxurious travel,――of exhilarating\r\nemotions, and fascinating though transient delights, will have\r\nto become one of sound practical legislation, of resuscitating\r\ninstitutions, of vigorous and comprehensive government;...”¹\r\n\r\n    ¹ Mount Lebanon, a ten years’ residence, from 1842 to 1852....\r\n      By Colonel Churchill.... London, 1853 (vol. i., _pp._ v‒x).\r\n\r\nAt the back of an analysis of the historical and geographical\r\nconditions of the country offered by the author is his conviction\r\nthat Palestine must become and will become the seat of a great,\r\npeaceful and prosperous settlement, which must be ruled by England\r\nor under English influence, or must have its independence and normal\r\ndevelopment secured by England. He holds that this position will\r\nstrengthen England’s power; and he feels subconsciously that England\r\nought to be wherever the greatest interests of humanity are at stake.\r\nSimilarly he contends that with this object in view England must adopt\r\na very active policy in the East.\r\n\r\nAnother authority on Oriental politics, Sir Austen Henry Layard\r\n(1817‒1894), whose discoveries and investigations in the East are the\r\npride of English Oriental science, expressed his opinion, in a speech\r\ndelivered in the House of Commons, in very similar words:――\r\n\r\n“We should not forget that, although Egypt is _a_ high road to India,\r\nSyria and the valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates form _the_ high road,\r\nand any power holding those countries would command India.”¹\r\n\r\n    ¹ The Turkish Question.

London:... 1854\r\n      (_p._ 10).\r\n\r\nBritish diplomacy seems to have been influenced by all these\r\nconsiderations.\r\n\r\nMr. W. Young was the first British Consul in _Jerusalem_, 1838. As\r\nwe know from Lord Shaftesbury’s Diaries, this appointment had been\r\nmade in consequence of his own representations and efforts. France\r\nand Prussia followed suit in 1843, and Austria in 1849. A Sardinian\r\nConsulate had been founded in 1843, but it was abolished in the year\r\nin which the Austrian was established. A Spanish Consulate was founded\r\nin 1854.\r\n\r\nThe two Protestant Consulates, those of England and Prussia, had no\r\nshare in the altercation about the Holy Places. Their relations with\r\nthe local government were restricted to protection of the property and\r\npersons of their nationals. The Prussian Consulate had at that time\r\nbut few subjects and small affairs to look after; while the English\r\nhad its own subjects, both residents and travellers, besides Maltese,\r\nIndians, Canadians and other British Colonists, with the Ionians as a\r\nprotected people, and also a number of protected Jews, together with\r\nconsiderable property, including a church hospital, various schools,\r\nand a cemetery, to watch over.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note how British protection for Palestinian Jews,\r\nthough not formally confirmed, was practically developing. This is the\r\nonly case in history of Jews enjoying the protection of a great Power\r\nwithout being subjects of that Power. Let us see how this remarkable\r\ndevelopment took place. In 1838 Lord Palmerston’s directions to his\r\nfirst Consul in _Jerusalem_ were to “_afford protection to the Jews\r\ngenerally_.”¹ The words were simply these, broad and liberal as under\r\nthe circumstances they had to be, leaving after events to work out\r\ntheir own modification. The instruction, however, seemed to bear on\r\nits face a recognition that the Jews there are a nation by themselves,\r\nand that contingencies might possibly arise which might alter their\r\nrelations with the Mohammedans, though it was impossible to foresee\r\nthe shape that future negotiations would assume after the impending\r\nexpulsion of the Egyptians from Syria.\r\n\r\n    ¹ Stirring Times, or Records from Jerusalem Consular\r\n      Chronicles, of 1853 to 1856. By the late James Finn,\r\n      M.R.A.S.... Vol. i.... London, 1878, _pp._ 106 _ff._\r\n\r\nThen came the atrocities of the Passover of 1840 in Damascus,\r\ninflicted on the Jews there during the Egyptian régime. A few months\r\nlater the bombardment of Acre and the restoration of Syria to the\r\nTurks took place. The episode of the Egyptian hold upon Syria from\r\n1832 to 1840 came to an end. The Turks were restored at the end of\r\n1840, being then rather more liberal in disposition than they had been\r\nbefore leaving the country, and in the following year the _Sultan_\r\npromulgated the _Hatti ♦Sheerif_ of Gulharch, which conceded equality\r\nin theory (but by no means in practice) to all classes of subjects.\r\n\r\n    ♦ “Shereef of Gulgarch” replaced with “Sheerif of Gulharch”\r\n      for consistency\r\n\r\nThe British Government at once brought before the consideration of\r\nthe Porte the condition of the Jews “already settled, or who might\r\nafterwards settle themselves in Palestine.” This was evidently a\r\ndirect encouragement towards the colonization of Palestine by the\r\nJews, made officially by the British Government. In April, 1841, Lord\r\nPalmerston forwarded a circular to his agents in the Levant and Syria,\r\nwhich began by stating that, as far as documents could avail, the law\r\nof Turkey had by that time become as favourable as might reasonably\r\nbe expected to the Jews, but that there remained the difficulty of\r\nenforcing an honest administration of that law. The Porte, however,\r\nbeing at that time entirely under the beneficial influence of\r\nBritish diplomacy, had declared its determination that the law should\r\nbe righteously administered, and had even promised Her Majesty’s\r\nAmbassador that “it will attend to any representations which may be\r\nmade to it by the Embassy of any act of oppression practised against\r\nJews.” The Consul was therefore to investigate diligently all cases\r\nof oppression of the Jews that might come to his knowledge, and report\r\nto the Embassy, and although he might only act officially on behalf\r\nof persons actually by right under British protection, he was on every\r\nsuitable occasion to make it known to the local authorities that “the\r\nBritish Government felt an interest in the welfare of Jews in general,\r\nand was anxious that they should be protected from oppression.” He\r\nwas also to make known the offer of the Porte to attend to cases of\r\npersecution that might be reported to the Embassy.\r\n\r\nIn 1842 a bad case was represented as occurring at _Hebron_ through\r\nacts of violence on the part of Shaiki Baddo and others. In 1847 again\r\nit seemed probable that Christian fanatics were about to reproduce\r\nthe horrors which occurred at Rhodes and Damascus in 1840. The British\r\nConsul, James Finn (1806‒1872), then interfered and protected the\r\nJews. In the same year he was again obliged to interfere on behalf\r\nof the Jews. In consequence of various occurrences of this kind in\r\n_Jerusalem_, another instruction was issued by the Foreign Office,\r\nto the effect that whenever any Austrian, French, or other European\r\nJew was suffering from persecution or injustice, and was repudiated\r\nby his own Consul, the English Consul might take up the case, unless\r\nthe repudiating Consul, when applied to, should assign some strong\r\nand sufficient reason for his objection. The spirit underlying this\r\ninstruction, notwithstanding the establishment, since 1839, of other\r\nEuropean Consulates, was in conformity with the rule laid down in that\r\nyear, “to afford protection to Jews generally.”¹\r\n\r\n    ¹ _Ibid._, _p._ 112.\r\n\r\nOne out of many tokens of gratitude from the people so benefited\r\nwill be found in an address in _Hebrew_ to Her Majesty Queen Victoria\r\n(1819‒1901), received from _Jerusalem_ in July, 1849 (Appendix lxii).\r\n\r\nThere were, as usual, many cases in which the Palestinian Jews needed\r\nthe official aid of the British Consulate, and numerous documents\r\nrefer to the instances in which active official intervention with\r\nthe Turkish Government was exercised on their behalf. Notwithstanding\r\nthe just jealousy of the Turkish Government, says Finn,¹ there were\r\nmany individual ways of ameliorating the condition of Jewish Ottoman\r\nsubjects, as well as of the Jews under British protection.\r\n\r\n    ¹ _Ibid._, vol. ii., _pp._ 55‒56.\r\n\r\nDuring the first case mentioned above no other Consul took part in\r\nthe business, except that the Sardinian Consul assured Finn in private\r\nconversation that there could be no doubt about Jews using Christian\r\nblood in the Passover rites whenever they could get it, or, at any\r\nrate, they did in the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\n                BRITISH INTEREST AND WORK IN PALESTINE\r\n\r\n    Mr. Rogers――Mr. Finzi――Agricultural work in Palestine under\r\n    the auspices of the British Consul――W.

They were no longer outwardly persecuted, being well\r\nknown to be under British protection.... The Russian Jews, now since\r\n1850 British protégés, enjoyed, especially in _Safed_ and _Tiberias_,\r\na tranquillity to which they had long been strangers, and the\r\nConsulate was well seconded in regard to them by Mr. [Edward Thomas]\r\nRogers (1830(1)‒1884), the new Vice-Consul at _Haifa_, besides whom we\r\nhad had from long previous years, as British Consular Agent, at Acre,\r\nMr. Finzi, who was a Jew.”¹\r\n\r\n    ¹ _Ibid._, vol. ii., _pp._ 56‒57.\r\n\r\nThe British Consul also started works of philanthropy which seemed to\r\nbe the beginning of an experiment in Jewish agriculture.\r\n\r\n“A plot of ground of about eight to twelve English acres had been\r\npurchased in 1852, on which as soon as money could be obtained for\r\nsupplying wages some of the poor had been set to work. That land was\r\nset apart for ever under the name of ‘the Industrial Plantation for\r\nemployment of Jews of _Jerusalem_,’ and it was in due time placed\r\nunder the security of three trustees.\r\n\r\n“The design was not so much to constitute a rural colony of farmers on\r\nthis spot, as to afford daily employment _to residents of the city_,\r\nreturning from work every evening to their families.\r\n\r\n“It was always designed that other branches of Jewish agricultural\r\nemployment, that might be carried on in other places in the vicinity,\r\nshould be associated with this institution under the general name of\r\n‘Industrial Plantation.’\r\n\r\n“We were not so sanguine as to expect pallid creatures, weakened by\r\nhunger and disease, to perform the labours of healthy robust peasants\r\nof the villages, but at least they could clear off the loose stones\r\nfrom the land in baskets, they could assist in building up dry walls\r\nof enclosure with the guidance of a few peasants; they could carry\r\nwater from the cistern, and they could learn to do other things.\r\n\r\n“These tasks would be profitable and preparatory. Upon such tasks we\r\nhad already in 1850 to 1853 employed as many poor Jews as the small\r\nfunds at our disposal had permitted. Now in 1854 we applied to friends\r\nin England, and elsewhere, to send us the means of relieving some\r\nof the vast amount of misery around us, by means of employment in the\r\nopen air. The appeal was responded to and funds were sent from England,\r\nfrom India, and also one or two contributions from America. By the\r\nmonth of April money had arrived, and we were able to set the people\r\nto work.... Notice was given to the Jews that employment on the\r\nland might be obtained for wages on the ground above-mentioned; the\r\nArabic name which it bore among the peasants, of its former owners,\r\nwas _Ker’m el Khaleel_――the vineyard of the Friend――_i.e. Abraham_\r\n(1948‒2123 _a.m._), by which epithet _Abraham_ is always known.\r\nThe very name of the ground was attractive, and the effect of the\r\nannouncement fulfilled our best expectations.”\r\n\r\n“The foreman in charge of the work was a Polish Jew who had been\r\nin the Russian Army.”¹ “The idea of labouring in the open air for\r\ndaily bread had taken root among the Jews in _Jerusalem_――the hope of\r\ncultivating the desolate soil of their own Promised Land was kindled.\r\nThese objects were never again lost sight of. The Jews themselves took\r\nthem up.”²\r\n\r\n    ¹ _Ibid._, _pp._ 64‒66.\r\n\r\n    ² _Ibid._, _p._ 76.\r\n\r\nSir Moses Montefiore was one of the first Jews who took up these\r\nobjects. On his second visit to _Jerusalem_ he was received by Colonel\r\nGawler, the ardent Christian Zionist. After this visit the impression\r\nwas left upon the public mind that the Jews, hitherto so despised,\r\nhad, in England at least, powerful representatives, through whom their\r\ngrievances might make themselves heard in Europe.\r\n\r\nAt the same time England’s interest in Palestine was growing in\r\nall directions. In 1849 an English Literary Society was founded by\r\nthe Consul, for the investigation of all subjects of literary and\r\nscientific interest in the Holy Land. English artists were also the\r\nfirst European artists who started serious work in Palestine. Two\r\nEnglish artists of note, William Holman Hunt, O.M. (1827‒1910) and\r\nThomas Seddon (1821‒1856), came to reside in the Holy City in 1852,\r\nin order to study Bible scenes and Eastern customs. Hunt was the first\r\npainter who attempted to depict the true colours of the mountains of\r\n_Moab_. He began in _Jerusalem_ his great picture of “The Scapegoat\r\nin the Wilderness.” Seddon pitched a tent among the pomegranate trees\r\nin the neighbourhood of _Jerusalem_, and his picture of “_Olivet and\r\nSiloam_,” now in the South Kensington Museum Gallery, was taken from\r\nthat spot.\r\n\r\nIn English literature we find another appeal made by an anonymous\r\npolitical writer in 1856 in a lofty moral tone, which is at the same\r\ntime a high appreciation of Judaism.\r\n\r\n“To do justice at once to a people approved of God as ‘His\r\nInheritance,’ ... a simple course is open to us――to the nations. Let\r\nus prevail upon the Porte to allow the Jews facilities to return to\r\ntheir own land; to appoint Palestine as a place of refuge for them,\r\nfrom the anarchy and confusion from which they suffer, but in which\r\nthey have no share....\r\n\r\n“If the allies are sincere in their professions towards the Porte,\r\nand its eyes are open to its own interests and safety; if Christians\r\nreally believe in a Just and Holy God, and that the Bible is His Word;\r\nif Mohammedans feel that God is great, who hath appointed them the\r\nkeepers of his holy place against this time, while their elder brother\r\nhas been in exile;... If then, we say, integrity in belief or duty has\r\nany place at all with the parties concerned; this matter of a refuge\r\nfor the Jews――has only to be mentioned to be accomplished....\r\n\r\n“Britons, let us at least be true to the position which the integrity\r\nand foresight of our fathers have, in the providence of God, earned\r\nfor us; true to the mission of our faith, ... seek at once to wash our\r\nhands of this monstrous rebellion against Judgment and Righteousness\r\n――the peace of the world and the progress of the human race――and do an\r\nact of tardy justice to a people to whom mankind owe all their higher\r\nprivileges and better civilization.”¹\r\n\r\n    ¹ The Crisis, and Way of Escape.

Even those who felt disinclined to connect the events of\r\nthe time with any particular prediction were ready to admit that these\r\nevents were coming as something more decisive in history than anything\r\nthat had happened since the Reformation. “With such impressions abroad,\r\nthe multitude of treatises on prophetic subjects soon exceeded all\r\nprecedent;...”¹\r\n\r\n    ¹ The Restoration of the Jews:... By David Brown, D.D., ...\r\n      Edinburgh.... London. 1861 (_p._ 60).\r\n\r\n“What most surprises us is, that a ritual of worship, so like the\r\nMosaic ceremonial, should again be restored by divine appointment,...\r\nFor we read of all the various offerings of the Levitical economy;...\r\nWe can only reply:――Such is the divine pleasure.”¹ But this one\r\nDivine is not the only precursor of _Rabbi_ Hirsch Kalischer in this\r\nidea; there were others who believed in it. The Rev. Capel Molyneux\r\n(1804‒1877) announced the restoration of the Mosaic sacrifices, and\r\nexplained its necessity from a Christian point of view.² The most\r\ncurious and interesting opinion is that of a Swiss Protestant divine,\r\nCarl August Auberlen (1824‒1864) of Basle:――“_Israel_ is again to be\r\nat the head of all humanity.... In the Old Testament the whole Jewish\r\nnational life was religious; but only in an external legal manner\r\n... in the millennial kingdom, all spheres of life will be truly\r\nChristianized outwardly from within. From this point of view it will\r\nnot be offensive to say that the Mosaic ceremonial law corresponds to\r\nthe priestly office of _Israel_――the civil law to its kingly office.\r\nThe Gentile Church could only adopt the moral law; in like manner\r\nher sole influence is by the word working inwardly, by exercising\r\nthe prophetic office. But when the royal and priestly office shall\r\nbe revived, then ... the ceremonial and civil law of _Moses_ also\r\nwill develop its spiritual depths in the Divine worship and in the\r\nconstitution of the millennial kingdom,” _etc._³ In a word, the Jews\r\nhave to be restored, and to live according to their Law, which, as\r\nthe learned professor believes, will “develop spiritual depths,” an\r\nidea which the most orthodox Jew would accept, and which is even more\r\nconservative than that of some of the _Talmudists_, who maintain that\r\nthe ritual prescriptions _Mizvoth_ will be abolished in the Messianic\r\nage.\r\n\r\n    ¹ The Second Advent;...

MDCCCLVI.\r\n\r\nExaggerations of this kind may have stimulated the opposition which\r\nwas represented by the Rev. Dr. William Urwick (1791‒1868) (the\r\nelder),¹ the Rev. Dr. Ebenezer Henderson² (1784‒1858), Professor\r\nJoseph Addison Alexander³ (1809‒1860), the Rev. Patrick Fairbairn⁴\r\n(1805‒1874), Dr. Thomas Arnold⁵ (1795‒1842), Head Master of Rugby,\r\nand many representatives of the so-called Spiritual school, who were\r\nstrongly opposed to these Judaizing tendencies. They endeavoured to\r\ntransform the plain statements of the Bible into airy visions, and\r\nexplained all the names (_Israel_, _Jerusalem_, _etc._) in a peculiar\r\nway. Thus it is to the “spiritual” Christian and not to the natural\r\nJew that the name of Israel belongs, as it is the Roman and the Greek\r\nto whom alone the promises of Restoration to the Holy Land were made,\r\nand not the “seed of _Abraham_.” In fact, the Spiritualists are far\r\nfrom being consistent. They would, for instance, spiritualize the\r\nIsrael which is blessed, and accept in a literal sense the Israel that\r\nis cursed. A departure from the literal meaning of words has always\r\nproved a source of error and confusion, as words are often taken\r\nliterally when they agree with certain theories, allegorically when\r\nthey do not――a process by which the Bible may be made to say something\r\nto please everybody. Spiritualistic interpreters, as a rule, go to the\r\nBible to find support for their own views, rather than to be guided by\r\nthe standard of the Word as to whether they be correct or not. Where\r\nthey find what they want, the Bible is plain, where they do not, it\r\nis difficult; and they have to have recourse to the expedient of what\r\nis called “spiritualizing” the Word, a term imposing enough, but most\r\ninapplicable――carnalizing would be a far more suitable designation of\r\nthe process.\r\n\r\n    ¹ The Second Advent....

To this may be added what the learned Joseph Mede (1586‒1638)\r\nsaid on the same subject from the Christian point of view: “I cannot\r\nbe persuaded to forsake the proper and usual import of Scripture\r\nlanguage, where neither the instruction of the text itself, nor\r\nmanifest tokens of allegory, nor the necessity and the nature of the\r\nthings spoken of do warrant it. For to do so were to lose all footing\r\nof Divine testimony, and instead of Scripture to believe mine own\r\nimaginations.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\n                        _THE LEBANON_ QUESTION\r\n\r\n    Selim I.――The _Emir_ Beshir of _The Lebanon_――A Conference of\r\n    five Powers――Druses and Maronites――Massacres in Damascus――A\r\n    Military Expedition――The Protocol of August 3rd, 1860\r\n    ――_General_ Beaufort _d’_Hautpoul――Achmet _Pasha_――David\r\n    _Pasha_――Joseph Karan――The Constitution of _The Lebanon_――The\r\n    boundaries――The alterations from 1861 to 1902――The Earl of\r\n    Carnarvon’s views――Jewish charity――Anti-Jewish accusations and\r\n    riots――M.

(1467‒1520),\r\n_The Lebanon_ was ruled by a succession of Mussulman _Emirs_, the most\r\nfamous of whom, Beshir Shehaab,¹ governed benevolently from 1789 to\r\n1840, in the later years of his reign by the help of Mehemet Ali. The\r\nwithdrawal of the Egyptian troops from Syria in 1841 was followed by\r\nanarchy in the mountains. Lord Palmerston accordingly wrote, on 15th\r\nJune of that year: “Her Majesty’s Government feel especially called\r\nupon to address the Turkish Government on this matter on the account\r\nof the oppression which Haji Nejib is said to practise upon the\r\nChristians. For England having, in conjunction with other Christian\r\nPowers, succeeded in restoring Syria to the _Sultan_, she is entitled\r\nto expect that the _Sultan_, in return for such assistance, should\r\nsecure his Christian subjects from oppression.” A conference of\r\nrepresentatives of Austria, France, Great Britain, Prussia and Russia\r\nmet at Constantinople on 27th May, 1842, with the ultimate result that\r\nthe Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs announced on 7th December\r\nthat the Porte would act upon the advice of the five Powers, and\r\nappoint separate _Kaimakams_ for the Druses and Maronites respectively.\r\nThis arrangement was in vogue with but slight success for nearly\r\ntwenty years.\r\n\r\n    ¹ Emir Bechir Shehaab (late), Prince of The Lebanon.

Saunders & Otley, 1853.\r\n\r\n      This portrait is the frontispiece of Mount Lebanon....\r\n      Colonel Churchill, vol. i.... 1853.\r\n\r\nIn 1860 the lasting feuds of the tribes in _The Lebanon_ suddenly\r\nburst into a furious attack, on the part of the Druses, on their\r\nMaronite neighbours. The Turkish authorities connived at the massacres\r\nwhich were committed. On the 9th of July, 1860, riots broke out\r\nin Damascus in consequence of the punishment inflicted upon a few\r\nMussulmans who had insulted the Christians. These Mussulmans rushed,\r\narmed to the teeth, to the Christian quarter, and began slaying,\r\nburning and pillaging. The Turkish soldiers came to their assistance\r\non the pretence of quelling the disturbance, made common cause with\r\nthe rioters, and joined in the killing, robbing and plundering. A\r\nfew old Mussulmans attempted to stop the massacres, but the Turkish\r\nofficers had no desire for peace; on the contrary, they spurred\r\non their soldiers to further aggression against the unfortunate\r\nChristians, and the soldiers were assisted by hordes of looters of\r\nevery sect. This state of things lasted two days, during which the\r\nrioters did not cease to massacre the Christians, to whom the Governor\r\ndid not afford any help. The number of the victims was estimated at\r\n3300. The places where their houses had stood were not recognizable,\r\nall their dwellings having been reduced to ashes.\r\n\r\nThe _Sultan_ sent Faud Pasha (1815‒1869) as an Extraordinary\r\nCommissioner with a military force. Faud _Pasha_ issued a Proclamation\r\nto the inhabitants of Syria, in which, after alluding to the grief\r\nfelt by the _Sultan_ on hearing of the outrages, he said:――\r\n\r\n“According to the Imperial commands, invested with a special and\r\nextraordinary mission, and possessing full powers, I have arrived,\r\naccompanied by a military force, to punish the guilty authors of so\r\nmany crimes.\r\n\r\n“The Imperial _firman_ will inform you what is my mission, and enable\r\neveryone to judge of the extent of the Imperial justice, which accords\r\nrefuge to the oppressed and punishes the oppressor.\r\n\r\n“All may remain here in safety; the condition of the families driven\r\nfrom their homes will be taken into consideration, and I undertake to\r\nreassure them, and to extend to them the protection of the Imperial\r\njustice.\r\n\r\n“I command, above all, that from this day forth dissensions cease;\r\nwhichever nation dares to use violence against the other shall be\r\nattacked by the military force which accompanies me, and every person\r\nwho forgets his duty will undergo immediate punishment.”\r\n\r\nBut Faud did not succeed in removing the difficulties, and each new\r\naccount added to the horrors of the massacre. It appeared that the\r\ncountry had almost been swept clean of its Christian inhabitants.\r\nIn _The Lebanon_ not a Christian village had been spared; all the\r\ncommerce of the region was interrupted; a journey from one village to\r\nanother was no longer safe.\r\n\r\nTo put an end to these excesses and to restore peace and safety to the\r\nprovince, the “Protocol of the 3rd of August” was signed. In August\r\nthe first French troops were landed on the Syrian Coast. It was a\r\ngratifying sign of the unanimity prevailing among all civilized Powers\r\nthat although the state of Europe was at that time far from tranquil,\r\nthe European nations were yet capable of unison in the cause of\r\njustice. It was certainly in the cause of justice that the forces of\r\nthe Western world were brought to the Syrian coast, though political\r\nintrigue was busy circulating rumours such as are bound to be spread\r\nabroad when an expedition of this kind is undertaken by European\r\nPowers. That France should send troops to a country which, according\r\nto popular belief, she had coveted for years was, indeed, enough to\r\nexcite world-wide attention. But opinion that mattered was inclined to\r\nassert that France had acted generously and loyally. It was, indeed,\r\ntoo absurd to profess the belief that intrigues in the East had given\r\nrise to these disturbances, and that the Christians themselves had\r\ncaused the massacre so that France should achieve glory and influence.\r\nUndoubtedly there was in every Levantine town a host of Catholic\r\nemissaries, Jesuits, Lazarists, and the like, and it was only natural\r\nfor Roman Catholics to use the name and invoke the protection of the\r\nPower which had once been the only Catholic Power known in the East.\r\n\r\nThe expedition of 1860 was made at the instance of France, but\r\naccording to an international convention all the Powers had to\r\nparticipate in it. A contingent of European troops, which was to\r\nbe increased to 12,000 men, was to be despatched for the purpose\r\nof restoring peace. France engaged to furnish half of these troops\r\nat once. If it became necessary to increase the force beyond the\r\nstipulated number, a further understanding was to be arrived at among\r\nthe contracting Powers. The Commander-in-Chief of the expedition was\r\nto enter into communication with the special Commissions of the Porte.\r\nAll the Powers were to keep sufficient naval forces on the Syrian\r\ncoast to assist in the maintenance or re-establishment of tranquillity\r\nthere. The contracting parties fixed the term of the occupation at\r\nsix months, being convinced that this period would be sufficient to\r\nensure the pacification of the populace. These were the principal\r\nterms of this important Convention, as laid down in the Protocol by\r\nthe representatives of Great Britain, Austria, France, Prussia, Russia\r\nand Turkey at Paris on the 3rd August.\r\n\r\n“The Plenipotentiaries of, _etc._, desirous of establishing, in\r\nconformity with the intention of their respective Courts, the true\r\ncharacter of the assistance afforded to the Sublime Porte, by the\r\nprovisions of the Protocol signed this day, the feelings which have\r\ndictated the clauses of this act, and their perfect disinterestedness,\r\ndeclare in the most formal manner that the contracting Powers do not\r\nintend to seek for, and will not seek for, in the execution of their\r\nengagements, any territorial advantage, and exclusive influence, or\r\nany concession with regard to the commerce of their subjects, such as\r\ncould not be granted to the subjects of other nations.”\r\n\r\nTroops were landed on the 16th of August under _General_ C. M. N.\r\nBeaufort _d’_Hautpoul (_b._ 1804). Subsequently a Commission\r\nrepresentative of the Powers was appointed to investigate the facts.\r\nThe Druses escaped into the Hauran Desert, and it was found that Turks\r\nand Damascene fanatics were really responsible for stirring up the\r\nstrife, in which the Maronites had acted with a vindictiveness equal\r\nto that of the Druses. Punishment was meted out to the Mohammedans\r\nwho were principally responsible, and among others Achmet _Pasha_, the\r\nGovernor of Damascus, was shot. The French occupation continued till\r\nthe 5th June, 1861, and the French and English squadron patrolled the\r\ncoast for several months after. In June, 1861, the troops returned to\r\nFrance, and the Commissions drew up a scheme of government for _The\r\nLebanon_. It provided for the appointment of a Christian Governor,\r\nto be chosen by the Porte, and for dividing the region into seven\r\ndistricts, each of which was to be controlled by a chief professing\r\nthe religion held by its inhabitants. David _Pasha_, an Armenian\r\nChristian, was the first Governor. He was installed on the 4th of July,\r\n1861. In spite of many difficulties, he succeeded in restoring order;\r\nand by raising a military force from the inhabitants of _The Lebanon_\r\nhe made the presence of the Turkish soldiery unnecessary. The district\r\nCouncil included four Maronites, one Druse, one Orthodox Greek, and\r\none Separatist Greek. The constitution did not satisfy the Maronites,\r\nwhose revolt, under Joseph Karan, kept _The Lebanon_ in a very\r\nunsettled state for several years. The privileged province of _The\r\nLebanon_ was finally constituted by the Organic Statute of the 6th of\r\nSeptember, 1864.\r\n\r\n_The Lebanon_ was constituted a _sanjak_ or _mutessariflik_, dependent\r\ndirectly on the Porte, which was to act in this case in consultation\r\nwith the six great Powers. The province extended about 93 miles from\r\nnorth to south (from the boundary of the _sanjak_ of Tripoli to that\r\nof the _caza_ of Sidon), and had a mean breadth of about 28 miles\r\nfrom one fort of the chain to the other, beginning at the edge of\r\nthe littoral plain behind Beyrout and ending at the western edge of\r\nthe Beka’a: but the boundaries were ill-defined, especially on the\r\neast, where the original line drawn along the crest of the ridge had\r\nnot been adhered to, and the mountains had encroached on the Beka’a.\r\n_The Lebanon_ was under a military Governor (_mashir_), who had been\r\na Christian in the service of the _Sultan_ (1861‒1876), Abdul Aziz\r\n(1830‒1876), approved by the Powers, and who had, so far, been chosen\r\nfrom the Roman Catholics, owing to the great preponderance of Latin\r\nChristians in the province. He resided at Deir-al-Kamar, an old seat\r\nof the Druse _Emirs_. At first appointed for three years, then for ten,\r\nhis term has been fixed since 1892 at five years, the Porte fearing\r\nthat the longer term might lead to a personal domination. Under the\r\nGovernor were seven _Kaimakams_, all Christians except a Druse in Shuf,\r\nand forty-seven _mudirs_, who all depended on the _Kaimakams_, except\r\none, in the home district of ♦Deir-al-Kamar. A central _mejliss_ or\r\nCouncil of twelve members was composed of four Maronites, three Druses,\r\none Turk, two Greeks (orthodox), one Greek Uniate and one _Metawel_.\r\nThis was the original proportion, and it has not been altered, in\r\nspite of the decline of the Druses and the increase of the Maronites.\r\nThe members are elected by the seven cazas. In each _mudirich_ there\r\nis also a local _mejliss_. Judges are appointed by the Governor,\r\nbut _Sheikhs_ by the villagers. Commercial cases, and law-suits in\r\nwhich strangers are concerned, are carried to Beyrout. The police\r\nis recruited locally, and no regular troops appear in the province\r\nexcept on special requisition. The taxes are collected directly, and\r\nmust meet the needs of the province before any sum is remitted to the\r\nImperial treasury. The latter has to make deficits good.\r\n\r\n    ♦ “Dier” replaced with “Deir”\r\n\r\nThis constitution has worked well on the whole. The only serious hitch\r\nthat occurred was caused by the attempts of the Governor-General and\r\nthe _Kaimakam_ to supersede the _mejliss_ by autocratic action, and\r\nto impair the freedom of the elections. The attention of the Porte\r\nwas called to these tendencies in 1892, and again in 1902, on the\r\nappointment of new Governors. The railway is French, and a precedence\r\nin ecclesiastical functions is accorded by the Maronites to the\r\nofficial representatives of France.\r\n\r\nHenry Howard Molyneux Herbert (1831‒1890), the fourth Earl of\r\nCarnarvon, wrote: “In estimating the past, and in taking security\r\nfor the future, it must never be forgotten that for generations the\r\npolicy of the Turkish Government has been eminently hostile to the\r\nmaintenance of Druse nationality. As charity obliges us to believe\r\nthat no state in Christendom would deliberately instigate the massacre\r\nof several thousand Christians, so the common instincts of humanity,\r\nand even self-interest, oblige us to acquit the Imperial Government\r\nof Constantinople from planning, or recommending to the execution\r\nof others, a policy of such detestable iniquity towards the subjects\r\nfor whose protection they are responsible. Both suppositions are too\r\nmonstrous to be entertained. But as it would not be the first time\r\nthat Christian rulers have fostered the disputes or exasperated\r\nthe irritation of other nations, and have set the rock in motion,\r\nunforeseeing and to a great extent reckless of the course which\r\nit will take, or the misery which it will inflict; so the local\r\nauthorities in Syria might not unreasonably count upon a favourable\r\ninterpretation in Constantinople of conduct, which might result either\r\nin some moderate spoliation of the Christian population, or in a\r\nhumiliation of the Druse mountaineers, or in a convenient opportunity\r\nfor intervening in the affairs of _The Lebanon_. It is a natural\r\nexpedient, it is doubtless the wish of the Turkish Government, to\r\ndivide and rule the tribes of _The Lebanon_;... The desire to break\r\ndown Druse independence enters at least equally into these schemes....\r\nIt is equally clear that it is not for the advantage of England,\r\nas far as she has an interest in these questions, to consent to\r\nthe annihilation of Druse nationality.... Again whilst convents and\r\nschools, ... have long laboured to create a French party among the\r\nMaronites, and to establish a French influence in _The Lebanon_, a\r\nstrong connection of gratitude on the one hand, and of good offices on\r\nthe other, has existed between the Druses and England; at all events,\r\n_The Lebanon_ has to be relieved of Turkish administration, because\r\nit would be indifferent statesmanship to stimulate still further the\r\ncentralizing policy that threatens Turkey equally with every other\r\nnation in Europe, and to allow the independent strength of local\r\ninstitutions and a peculiar race to be confounded in the ruin of an\r\nempire now tottering to its fall.”\r\n\r\nThis was a sound political opinion, clear, logical, based upon justice.\r\nIt is to be regretted that the same policy was not applied to other\r\nprovinces and other distinct races. As regards British interests, we\r\nfind again the old and indisputable truth expressed as follows:――\r\n\r\n“Territorial extension, indeed, need never enter into the dreams\r\nof English statesmanship; but it would be an act of infatuation\r\nto overlook the vast importance of Syria in any present or future\r\ndistribution of European Power, which either the weakness or the\r\ncrimes of other nations may necessitate. The country which now, not\r\nless than in the reigns of the _Ptolemies_ and the _Mamelukes_, guards\r\nand therefore governs the northern frontier of Egypt――which now,\r\nas in the days of Alexander [(III.) the Great] (356‒323 _b.c.e._),\r\ncommands one at least of the great approaches to India――is no\r\npetty principality, to be surrendered to the love of ease or the\r\nimportunities of allies.”¹\r\n\r\n    ¹ Recollections of the Druses of the Lebanon, and Notes on\r\n      their Religion. By the Earl of Carnarvon. London:... 1860,\r\n      (_pp._ 117‒120.)\r\n\r\nThe calamity that had befallen the Christians of Syria had aroused\r\nthe deepest commiseration among the Jews all over the world. Sir\r\nMoses Montefiore led the way with a letter in the _Times_, July 12,\r\n1860 (_p._ 9), and M. Crémieux in France followed his lead. Several\r\n_Rabbis_ and Presidents of Jewish communities addressed appeals to the\r\nJewish population, and handsome contributions were collected.\r\n\r\nBut unfortunately false accusations were again brought against the\r\nJews in Damascus. Some of the fanatics were envious of the Jews,\r\nespecially because they had escaped the slaughter. The accusations\r\ncommenced whilst Faud _Pasha_ was still there and was conducting the\r\ninquiries in person. The Maronites accused the Jews of being in league\r\nwith the Druses, the orthodox Greeks charged them with being on terms\r\nof reciprocity with the Maronites, and after all these slanders the\r\nblood accusation was circulated. Faud, who knew perfectly well that\r\nthe Jews had nothing in common with the Druses or the Maronites, and\r\nthat they were a peaceful and law-abiding people, would not listen\r\nto these calumnies. But after the _Pasha_ had left, Christian and\r\nMohammedan fanatics, by means of bribery, conspired against the\r\nunfortunate Jews, and had some prominent members of their community\r\narrested, bringing forward false witnesses to testify that they saw\r\nsuch and such a Jew committing murder. Happily, most of them were at\r\nonce released by Faud _Pasha_ on his return to the city. This act of\r\njustice was performed by the Turkish functionary spontaneously, before\r\nany remonstrance from Europe could have reached him. Nevertheless, the\r\ntwo European Powers acted with promptness and used their influence in\r\nthe matter.\r\n\r\nM. E. A. Thouvenal (1818‒1866), Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nFrance, had on September 23rd, 1860, given the most stringent orders\r\nto his agents in Syria to protect the Jews, and to prevent any injury\r\nbeing done to them; and so had Lord John Russell (1792‒1878), who had\r\nalso generously joined the defenders of the Jewish population in the\r\nEast. This united action on the part of the two Governments prevented\r\nmisfortunes and the perpetration of crimes against the Jews, and as a\r\nconsequence 1860 bore no analogy to 1840.\r\n\r\nBut if the Jews were saved from massacre and riot, this did not solve\r\ntheir problem. Dr. Abraham Benisch, in an editorial,¹ pointed out\r\nthat “In permitting this terrible outbreak of fanaticism in Syria,\r\nProvidence has once more prominently directed the attention of the\r\nworld to the country forming the inalienable inheritance of the\r\ndescendants of the patriarchs, and the cradle of the institutions\r\nthat have regenerated and reinvigorated a decrepit and decaying\r\ncivilisation, and has once more forcibly reminded the world that ever\r\nsince the ruthless Romans exterminated the Jew from the land of his\r\nancestors, no race has found there rest for the sole of its feet, and\r\nno population has been permitted to enjoy in peace, for any length of\r\ntime, the blessings of a ground due to the wandering tribe of the sore\r\nfoot.”\r\n\r\n    ¹ _Jewish Chronicle_, July 27, 1860.\r\n\r\nWith reference to these remarks, the following letter was received\r\nfrom the Christian Zionist, Colonel Gawler:――\r\n\r\n    “DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n    “I cannot refrain from giving expression to my sincere\r\n    gratification at your valuable leading article of the 27th\r\n    inst. I need scarcely mention that your views are met by my\r\n    very warmest reciprocity on the point that, ‘in permitting\r\n    this terrible outbreak of fanaticism in Syria, Providence\r\n    has once more prominently directed the attention of the world\r\n    to the country forming the inalienable inheritance of the\r\n    descendants of the Patriarchs.’\r\n\r\n    “You may remember a plan to which I gave publication on\r\n    the occasion of the war between the Druses and Maronites\r\n    in 1845, upon the ‘tranquillisation of the East by planting\r\n    Jewish (agricultural) settlements in Palestine.’ I entertain\r\n    strongly the anticipation that something of this kind may\r\n    arise from the present disturbances.\r\n\r\n    “To give Jews in Palestine the means of maintaining\r\n    themselves and their families by honest and healthy industry\r\n    would be the best preparation of the way for better things,\r\n    to the Jewish nation and to the whole human race, that could\r\n    be desired.\r\n\r\n    “In maintaining such projects I am not at all proposing\r\n    faithlessness to ‘our allies’ the Turks. So long as the\r\n    empire stands, Jewish civilised settlement in Syria would\r\n    be a strength and a blessing to it. It is only in the event\r\n    of its ever falling that I should be glad to see the claim\r\n    boldly enforced in reference to Palestine, ‘This portion\r\n    belongs to the God of _Israel_, and to his national people.’\r\n\r\n    “I should be truly rejoiced to see in Palestine a strong\r\n    guard of Jews established in flourishing agricultural\r\n    settlements, and ready to hold their own upon the mountains\r\n    of Israel against all aggressors. I can wish for nothing more\r\n    glorious in this life than to have my share in helping them\r\n    to do so.\r\n\r\n    “May your anticipation be richly realised, that great good\r\n    will come out of the existing Syrian evils.\r\n\r\n                                                “GEORGE GAWLER.¹\r\n\r\n    “...

Great possibilities threw their light into the future\r\nlike a beacon of hope. The new _Lebanon_ Constitution was, indeed, an\r\nindication of the future of Palestine: but the time was not yet ripe\r\nfor the realization of these hopes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\n                          ZIONISM IN FRANCE\r\n\r\n    Joseph Salvador――Lazar Lévy-Bing――Maurice [Moses] Hess――D.\r\n    Nathan――Benoît Levy――Dr. A.-F. Pétavel――Ernest Laharanne\r\n    ――Crémieux――The “Alliance Israélite Universelle”――Albert Cohn\r\n    ――Charles Netter.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN France the Zionist idea found a supporter in one of the most\r\nprominent French Jews of the last century, Joseph Salvador (1796‒1873).\r\nHe was the first French Jew after the emancipation of the Jews in\r\nFrance to express the great ideas of ancient Judaism. From 1789\r\nto 1822, when the first edition of his _Essay on Mosaism_ made its\r\nappearance, a period of thirty-three years had elapsed――approximately\r\nthe span of a generation, and generally the time it takes for a new\r\nepoch to develop. Salvador, as the intellectual leader of his epoch,\r\nwas inspired by those fine moral instincts and that devotion to\r\nhumanity which are fostered by the influence of the Bible.\r\n\r\nWhen in 1840 the Eastern question presented itself in all its\r\ndisquieting developments, Salvador seemed already to anticipate\r\nthe stress and strife that were destined to break forth in those\r\nregions where the cradle of the Jewish nation had stood; and these\r\nanticipations were strengthened when fifteen years later the Christian\r\nnations of the Western world came to wage a sanguinary war for the\r\nHoly Places. According to Salvador, Palestine was destined to become\r\nthe economic centre of Jewry, just as much as it was the centre of\r\nJewish national aspirations. “A new life will be infused into the\r\nmountains of _Judah_, into that platform of the _Moriah_ which to-day\r\nis in the hands of the Turks, and of which it was figuratively said\r\nof old that, sooner or later, it would rise above all hills, all\r\nmountains. The Oriental question, for a while put off or veiled by\r\nother public affairs, will exhaust all the present generation. It\r\nwill extend into the next century. To-day, in 1853, its character is\r\nabove all a political one: it is a question of Constantinople and the\r\nDardanelles. To-morrow, perhaps, the discussion will be a commercial\r\none in regard to Egypt, the Red Sea, Suez. The unity of Europe,\r\nso much desired, so much praised, and never obtained, is already a\r\nquestion of secondary importance. The centre of the affairs of the\r\nworld is changed. The Jew of the new era must rise upon the very soil\r\nwhere the Jew of the old era was built.”\r\n\r\n  Illustration: JOSEPH SALVADOR      BENJAMIN DISRAELI, M.P.\r\n\r\n                SAMUEL DAVID LUZZATTO         BERNARD LAZARE\r\n\r\n“Asia Minor has but two elements of life, two races capable of\r\ncivilization and progress, the Greeks and the Jews. Notwithstanding\r\nthe deep degradation of the Jews of the East, on the day when new life\r\n(which, by the way, is drawn from the Occident) shall have reanimated\r\nthis population, the Jew, by the force of his name, by the promises\r\nof his future, will again become a centre of irresistible attraction\r\nto all the Jewish forces of the Orient, and even of a part of Europe.\r\nA new State will be formed upon the coasts of _Galilee_ and in old\r\nCanaan, where the Jewish claim will dominate under the combined\r\npressure of historic remembrances, of persecution in some countries,\r\nand of the Puritan sympathy of Biblical England.” These words of\r\nSalvador sounded like the cry of a forgotten generation. It must\r\nbe borne in mind that they were written at a time when French Jews\r\ncherished only one hope and one ideal: absorption and assimilation by\r\ntheir surroundings. It is indeed remarkable that this venerable man,\r\nwho was a staunch Jew as well as a French patriot, and is one of the\r\nmost eminent figures in Franco-Jewish literature, defended the Jewish\r\nnational idea and the restoration of the Jews to Palestine with such\r\nclearness and force.¹\r\n\r\n    ¹ J. Salvador, sa vie, ses œuvres et ses critiques, par le\r\n      Colonel Gabriel Salvador [1812‒1889].

But the mere\r\nopportunity could not by itself awaken such thoughts without the\r\nstrong foundation and support of deeper convictions. As he justly says,\r\n“the Jew of the new era must rise upon the very soil where the Jew\r\nof the old era was established.” It is clear that he did not think of\r\nthe half-united Jews who do not feel the existence of their spiritual\r\nnationality, and wish to eradicate every trace of it. He was eager\r\nto insist that “the Jewish forces of the Orient and even of a part of\r\nEurope” should create this new Jew.\r\n\r\nJoseph Salvador was, like all progressive thinkers of his age,\r\ninspired by the great Revolution, the emancipation of the Jews,\r\nand the brotherhood of all nations. The main thesis of his books\r\nabout the Laws of _Moses_ was the “universal mission of Judaism.” No\r\nJewish thinker of the Assimilation school has defended this theory\r\nmore consistently and more powerfully, in language more eloquent\r\nand magnificent. He was therefore generally regarded as the father\r\nof modern progressive Judaism in France. But he did not see any\r\ncontradiction between his idea of a spiritual achievement and the idea\r\nof a terrestrial centre, which was suggested by the political thinking\r\nof his day. This fact, in our judgment, proves that the first idea of\r\na Jewish mission, as conceived by the great Jews of the last century,\r\nwas far from negating the desirability of a Jewish national future.\r\n\r\nWe find a reference to this subject in a long controversy which was\r\npublished in the Franco-Jewish fortnightly _Archives Israélites_ in\r\n1864. One of the contributors to this magazine, _M._ Lazar Lévy-Bing,\r\nin a letter entitled “Rétablissement de la Nationalité Juive,” dated\r\nfrom Nancy, 21 Mars,¹ and in another, “Suite d’une polémique,” Nancy,\r\n2 Mai,² tells us in clear, straightforward terms, that he firmly\r\nbelieves in a Jewish national future, and considers it the only\r\nsolution of the Jewish problem. He had strong religious convictions,\r\nand his most earnest hope was to reconcile the spirit of the age\r\nwith the eternal truths of Judaism; for he held that a nation which\r\nrepudiated its faith in God would abandon the very foundation of\r\nmorality. He regarded union between Jews and the friends of liberty\r\nas an indispensable condition of human progress. He maintained that\r\nthe Jews would best serve the universal cause of civilization by\r\nworking mainly for their own commonwealth, by preparing for their own\r\nfuture. Obviously, he says, the minority of Jews in free countries\r\nwill be chiefly concerned about the present, and their energies\r\nwill be consumed in their own environments, but the majority of Jews\r\nwill work in a Jewish direction. There is no incompatibility between\r\nthe Restoration of Palestine promised by the prophets, and Jewish\r\npatriotism which strives for the welfare of different states.\r\n\r\n    ¹ XXVᵉ Année.―― ... 15 Avril, 1864.

On the other hand, _M._ D. Nathan, Chef d’escadron\r\nd’artillerie, in a letter, “Une Question Soulevée,” dated from\r\nToulon 21 Avril,² and M. Benoît Levy, in “Tentative de Conciliation,”\r\n15 Juin,³ denounced the idea of the restoration as a sublime\r\nand unrealizable dream. The heated controversy arose through the\r\nintervention of a Christian theologian, Dr. Abram-François Pétavel\r\nof Neuchatel, who appealed to Jews in favour of their restoration\r\nto Palestine.⁴ He published two books,⁵ in which he dealt with the\r\nquestion from a theological point of view. His letters to the Jews,\r\nhowever, lacked clearness. He attempted to bring about a sort of\r\ncompromise, but created a bad impression. His action spurred the\r\nopposition afresh, with the result that instead of arguing _ad rem_\r\nit took to arguing _ad hominem_.\r\n\r\n    ¹ _Ibid._ 1ᵉʳ Janvier, _pp._ 14‒17: 1ᵉʳ Fevrier, _pp._\r\n      102‒106: 15 Fevrier, _pp._ 145‒149: 1ᵉʳ Mars, _pp._ 198‒202:\r\n      15 Mars, _pp._ 240‒244: 1ᵉʳ Avril, _pp._ 287‒292: 15 Avril,\r\n      _pp._ 336‒340: 1ᵉʳ Mai, _pp._ 377‒382: 15 Mai, _pp._\r\n      432‒436: 1ᵉʳ Juin, _pp._ 472‒477.\r\n\r\n      His _Rom und Jerusalem_ (1862) is one of the masterpieces\r\n      of modern Zionist literature.

It remains to be said that all the French writers\r\nof that epoch dealt with the question in the abstract.

In 1827 he removed to Paris, where\r\nhis name was well known. His splendid oratory soon gained him high\r\nesteem in the Law Courts. He gradually rose to fame on account of\r\nhis political sagacity and integrity of purpose. In 1840 he came over\r\nto England as the accredited representative of the French Jews to\r\ntake part in the deliberations held on the initiative of Sir Moses\r\nMontefiore concerning the Damascus massacres. He was at that time\r\nVice-President of the “Consistoire Central” of the French Jews. Soon\r\nafter his arrival in England he became, with the exception of Sir\r\nMoses Montefiore, the most prominent figure in the agitation which\r\nwas inaugurated in this country to obtain reparation from Mehemet Ali\r\nfor the anti-Jewish outrages which had been perpetrated within his\r\njurisdiction. Crémieux then accompanied Sir Moses on his mission to\r\nthe East, and by his sound advice and diplomacy helped to surmount\r\nmany difficulties. When the success of the mission had been ensured\r\nhe proceeded with Sir Moses to Constantinople, where he assisted him\r\nin obtaining from Abdul Medjid the _Firman_ of the 12th _Ramadan_\r\nin favour of the Jews. Two years after this brilliant achievement he\r\nmade his début in the political arena. He took his seat in the Chamber\r\nof Deputies, and rose to a position of considerable influence. He\r\nidentified himself prominently with the extreme left, and not only\r\nexercised great influence among the members of his own party, but\r\nassociated himself more actively than anyone else with the efforts\r\nthat paved the way for the Revolution of 1848. From that time he\r\nbecame one of the political leaders of his country, being always\r\nin power though not always in office. He was several times member\r\nof the French Cabinet, and in 1870 he was one of the members of the\r\nGovernment of National Defence.\r\n\r\nThe emancipation of the Jews in Algeria was due to his initiative and\r\nexertions. In 1860 he co-operated with Sir Moses Montefiore in raising\r\na fund for the Christians in Syria. During the same year he assisted\r\nin founding the “Alliance Israélite Universelle.” He was its first\r\nPresident, and remained at its helm till his death (1880), taking\r\na prominent part in all its affairs. He was the central figure of a\r\ngreat and glorious struggle not only for “Jewish rights,” but also\r\nfor the honour, the greatness and the real significance of Jewish\r\nbrotherhood and of the ideas of Judaism. From the defence of the\r\nJewish martyrs of Damascus down to the Berlin Congress (1878) his\r\ncareer was one long record of strenuous and enthusiastic effort\r\non behalf of the Jewish people all over the world. He typified and\r\npersonified all that is sublime in the Jewish cause. His whole life\r\nproved the consistency of his Jewish convictions. His attitude and\r\ntone were those of a Jewish Victor Hugo. There was no more inspiring\r\norator and no greater intellect. He was the creator of the “Alliance\r\nIsraélite Universelle” in the highest sense. He raised it from\r\ninsignificance to the importance it had achieved before he died. His\r\nlast official act as the President of the “Alliance” was to sign an\r\nappeal on behalf of Jewish schools in _Jerusalem_.\r\n\r\n  Illustration:  ALBERT COHN           CHARLES NETTER\r\n\r\n                         ISAAC M. A. CRÉMIEUX\r\n\r\n                 _Rabbi_ ZADOK KAHN      SALOMON MUNK\r\n\r\nA ruthless agitation was raised against the “Alliance,” and Crémieux\r\nwas personally attacked owing to his advocacy of the emancipation\r\nof the Jews in Algeria, and the international character of the\r\n“Alliance.” The wildest rumours were circulated with regard to the\r\nintentions and activities of the “Alliance,” which were condemned\r\nas anti-patriotic, anti-Christian, and even anti-humanitarian. The\r\ngreatest absurdities found their way into the sensational anti-Jewish\r\nPress of several countries, attributing to this humanitarian and\r\ncharitable institution innumerable crimes and wickednesses. Had\r\nCrémieux been one of those weak-minded Jewish assimilants who are\r\nso easily frightened by accusations and perturbed by anti-Jewish\r\nprejudice, he would have made concessions or have entirely abandoned\r\nthis sphere of activity. But he had sufficient moral strength to\r\ndisregard senseless accusations.\r\n\r\nCrémieux was not a Zionist in the modern sense of the term. But\r\none may say, without exaggeration, that his Jewish enthusiasm, his\r\nconception of the greatness of _Israel_, and his love for Palestine\r\nwere Zionistic. He was a happy combination of a great Jew and a\r\ngreat French patriot. Visions of the future of _Israel_ elevated his\r\nintellectual outlook. The resurrection of the Holy Land was for him a\r\nquestion of first-rate importance. “This is,” he said, “the comfort,\r\nthe sunshine of our life.” On another occasion he said: “It must be\r\nadmitted that heretofore insufficient attention has been paid to the\r\nEastern aspect.” Speaking of the agricultural school “_Mikveh Israel_,”\r\nnear _Jaffa_, he said: “This will become the very bulwark of the\r\nfuture. When once the Jews set foot on their own native soil they will\r\nnever leave it again.” In all his speeches he laid emphasis upon the\r\nneed for knowledge of the _Hebrew_ Bible. The Jewish ideal, to use\r\nhis own term, “is quite distinct,” and those who trample upon justice\r\nwill have to come back to us, the progeny and successors of those who\r\nfirst received “the Divine Word.” This is the spirit which animated\r\nthe “Alliance Israélite Universelle,” particularly during the earlier\r\nstages of its existence.\r\n\r\nOne of the most active members of the “Alliance,” and a devoted friend,\r\npupil and admirer of Crémieux, was Albert Cohn (1814‒1877). He filled\r\nnumerous communal and other offices with distinction. He was a member\r\nof the Central Consistory of France, President of the Paris Benevolent\r\nSociety, a prominent member of the “Alliance,” and President of the\r\nSociety of the Promised Land. He sympathized with all who were in\r\ndistress, and participated in their grief; he expended a great part of\r\nhis wealth in mitigating their sufferings; his time was always at the\r\ncommand of the poor. He combined the characteristics of an idealistic\r\nand a practical Jew. He was an ardent communal worker in the Jewish\r\ncommunity in Paris, but at the same time was engaged throughout his\r\nlife in Palestinian work. He had a remarkable gift of intuition, and\r\nforetold great future developments in Palestine.¹\r\n\r\n    ¹ Albert Cohn wrote in a letter, in French, from _Jérusalem_,\r\n      ce 15 juillet (in a moment of extraordinary clairvoyance):――\r\n\r\n      “MONSIEUR LE REDACTEUR,\r\n\r\n      “... when we succeed to make this patriarchal City a centre\r\n      of religious studies, a sort of a Jewish University for the\r\n      Orient and the adjacent countries ... we shall have erected\r\n      a worthy monument to the spirit of the age” (Archives\r\n      Israélites, Nº. 16――15 Août, 1864, _p._ 715).\r\n\r\nAnother French Jew of special note, as one of the first pioneers of\r\nthe colonization of Palestine, was Charles Netter (1826‒1882). As\r\nearly as 1858 he was the chief promoter of the “Société de Patronage\r\ndes Ouvriers Juifs de Paris.” In 1859 (after the Mortara case) he\r\nconceived, together with Crémieux and others, the idea of a “Universal\r\nJewish Alliance.” The “Alliance” was definitely formed in 1861.\r\nNetter was a member of a Committee of six charged with drawing up the\r\nrules and the general work of organization. A few schools having been\r\nestablished by the “Alliance” in Turkey and Morocco, Netter began\r\nto direct his attention to the condition of the Jews in Palestine.\r\nHe undertook a journey to Jerusalem and made very exhaustive\r\ninquiries. On his return he laid before his colleagues a plan for\r\nthe establishment of an agricultural school in the Holy Land, which\r\nwas immediately adopted. Returning to Palestine, he selected a\r\nlarge and convenient site in the vicinity of _Jaffa_, and personally\r\nsuperintended the erection of the school _Mikveh Israel_, the\r\nconstruction of the various buildings, the boring of the wells and\r\nthe laying out of the grounds and gardens. That Crémieux could not\r\nbe silent or idle while the work for _Mikveh Israel_ proceeded, goes\r\nwithout saying. The school became the favourite institution of all the\r\noriginal leaders of the “Alliance.” It is a curious coincidence that\r\nthe title of Manasseh Ben-Israel’s most famous book, _Mikveh Israel_\r\n(1650),¹ became, two hundred and twenty years after its appearance,\r\nthe name of the first Jewish agricultural school in Palestine. Netter\r\nvisited Palestine very often in subsequent years. In 1882 he left\r\nParis for his last visit to _Jaffa_, paying a visit to London on his\r\nway in order to consult the Jewish organizations of England on some\r\npressing questions connected with the Jews in Palestine. He died at\r\n_Jaffa_ whilst on a visit to _Mikveh Israel_.\r\n\r\n    ¹ The Hope of Israel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\n                         JEWISH COLONIZATION\r\n\r\n    New developments――Two tendencies――Societies in London for\r\n    supporting Jewish colonization of Palestine――_Rabbi_ Chayyim\r\n    Zebi Sneersohn――Sir Moses Montefiore’s further journey to\r\n    Palestine.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE various projects and suggestions discussed above fell far short\r\nof real Zionism, although some of them were permeated with Zionist\r\nideals. Between the Restoration of _Israel_ preached by Christians and\r\nthat advocated by national Jews, between theological combinations and\r\nrational organized work, lie innumerable intermediate phases. And each\r\nphase may be said to furnish a certain kind of evidence of the changes\r\nundergone by public opinion towards the Zionist idea. Often enough,\r\nindeed, the attitude of the public mind is one that eludes rigid\r\nclassification. Yet, while the currents of ideas and imaginations\r\ncrossed and recrossed, joined and interlinked one with another,\r\ntwo alternating tendencies were plainly apparent even to the least\r\npractical observer: the _philanthropic_ and the _national_.\r\n\r\nThe philanthropic tendency had undoubtedly as its _raison d’être_ the\r\nplan of settling small groups of Jewish agriculturists in Palestine.\r\nA succession of experiments in this kind of work was necessary.\r\nJust as, for instance, vegetable products have been introduced into a\r\ncountry by a single individual, the recognition of their utility being\r\nsufficient to induce the inhabitants to take advantage of the novelty,\r\nso the establishment of small settlements in Palestine might be\r\nexpected to lead to imitation and consequent further development. But\r\nat the same time, even if the results of these experiments remained\r\nfor years much less extensive than might be desired, and instead of\r\nthousands of Jews only hundreds settled on the land, it would still be\r\ntoo much to assert that the first societies had failed to fulfil their\r\nlegitimate purpose. It was not unimportant to have made a beginning,\r\nand to have sown even a few scattered seeds, which during a fruitful\r\nseason, aided by the dew of God’s blessing, might yield an abundant\r\nharvest. If public activity to promote such plans had been as\r\nenergetic as the intrinsic merits of the cause deserved, an objection\r\non account of the insignificance of the work would have mattered but\r\nlittle, because a comparatively small measure of success would have\r\nbeen deemed of sufficient importance to counterbalance many cases\r\nof failure. It was not surprising, however, that where scepticism\r\nprevailed the results of Palestinian colonisation were not such as\r\nto silence the objections of practical people who were insufficiently\r\ninspired by the Zionist idea. The breadth of Zionist premises seemed\r\nto them out of proportion to the results which Zionists succeeded in\r\nobtaining. They ridiculed the apparent poverty of the achievement as\r\ncompared with the powerful machinery which had been set in operation,\r\nthe strewing of abundant seeds for the sake of reaping a few mature\r\nplants. But to the sincere supporter even a comparatively small\r\nmeasure of success appeared highly important, for he measured the\r\nvalue of that success by his eager desire for the boon of a new future.\r\n\r\nThree Societies for the support of Jewish Colonization in Palestine\r\nwere founded in London at the beginning of the sixties of the last\r\ncentury. One, managed by Jews and Christians together, was mainly “for\r\npromoting Jewish settlements in Palestine” through the encouragement\r\nof agricultural pursuits.¹ Another, also under the management of\r\nChristians and Jews, comprised several separate undertakings in the\r\nneighbourhood of _Jerusalem_. A third was founded by the American\r\nConsul in _Jerusalem_, with the idea that the direction should be\r\nplaced in the hands of the Jews only. Its first efforts were to be\r\ncentred on _Jerusalem_ and its neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n    ¹ Dr. Abraham Benisch――William Henry Black (1808‒1872),\r\n      founder of the Palestine Archæological Association (1853)\r\n      and pastor of the seventh day Baptists――Alfred Hall\r\n      ――Montague Leverson――Rev. John Mills (1812‒1873)――Hugh\r\n      Owen――Solomon Sequerra were among its members.\r\n\r\nWhether it was possible to frame a workable scheme of colonization\r\non an extensive scale, and whether any such scheme could be carried\r\ninto practice with any chance of success, were questions difficult\r\nto answer. It was a fact that beyond the walls of the old (Jewish)\r\n_Jerusalem_ there was no safety for life or limb, and still less\r\nfor property. But, on the other hand, it was known that this evil\r\nwas not ineradicable, for during the few years when Syria was under\r\nthe control of Mehemet Ali the energetic government of that Prince\r\neffectually curbed the lawlessness of the wandering tribes, and so\r\nthoroughly established security that a person might have travelled\r\nfrom one frontier town of Syria to the other with a bag of money in\r\nhis hands, without fearing any attempt at robbery. Moreover, before\r\nthe evacuation of Syria by the Egyptian troops, Sir Moses Montefiore\r\nhad been seriously engaged in the plan of establishing a Jewish centre\r\nof settlement in the Holy Land, and had entered into negotiations with\r\nMehemet Ali, the Viceroy of Egypt, when the surrender of Syria to the\r\nPorte frustrated his great design. Those who have had the opportunity\r\nof referring to the second private journal of Lady Montefiore will\r\nfind in the Addenda (Appendix lxiv) full particulars of this project.\r\nThis experienced philanthropist had not therefore considered such a\r\nscheme impracticable twenty-three years earlier. The question was:\r\nHad circumstances so altered since the accession of the _Sultan_ Abdul\r\nAziz to the throne that any plan of this kind would have as good a\r\nchance of success as it had offered under Mehemet Ali? “Difficulties,”\r\nsaid a great statesman, “are made to be overcome”: and after all,\r\nwhy should those presented by such a scheme prove insuperable? The\r\nproposition of itself was, unquestionably, worthy of the attention\r\nof a generation so enterprising and so eminently practical in its\r\nphilanthropic exertions as that of the sixties of the last century.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that _Rabbi_ Chayyim Zebi Sneersohn, of\r\n_Jerusalem_, addressed to the Jews of England an open letter\r\n(Appendix lxv) advocating the promotion of Jewish colonization. One\r\nof the replies was the announcement of Sir Moses Montefiore’s new\r\njourney to Palestine. Possibly this visit had no further object than\r\nthe gratification of a natural desire to see again the places so holy\r\nand so closely connected with _Israel’s_ most sacred associations,\r\nwhich had been especially endeared to him as the centre of his\r\nrepeated pilgrimages in past years.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, public opinion inclined to the view that there was a\r\nconnection between this journey and the Jewish Commonwealth projected\r\nmany years before, which would indeed have been established had not\r\nSyria unfortunately passed from the power of Mehemet Ali, under whom\r\nlife and property were well protected, into the weak hands of the\r\n_Sultan_, under whom the land had soon relapsed into its former state\r\nof lawlessness. A whole generation had passed away since then, and\r\nduring this interval much had changed for the better in Syria.\r\n\r\nForeigners were now enabled to hold landed property in the dominions\r\nof the Porte. The Government of the country had become much more\r\nsettled. Roads had been made: the fierce Bedouins were held in\r\ncheck. Travelling in the country was much safer than in former years.\r\nAn incessant stream of pilgrims from all directions had begun to\r\npour into the land. The bounds of _Jerusalem_ had been considerably\r\nextended, and the approaching completion of the Suez Canal had given\r\na new impetus to the cultivation of the soil and trade in general.\r\n\r\nWas it not now possible to take up the project contemplated in 1839,\r\nbut abandoned after a time, under more favourable auspices? Such an\r\nundertaking was not to be carried out by one section of the Jewish\r\npeople: it required the united forces of the Jews of the civilized\r\nworld. And the magic spell which should weld all these scattered\r\nforces into one united whole had not yet been spoken. A publicist\r\nwrote at that time in the _Jewish Chronicle_:――\r\n\r\n“Can it be doubted that the name of Montefiore would prove the magic\r\nspell, were only authority given to utter it? It is likely that in the\r\nfirst instance not all standard-bearers of _Jerusalem_ would join the\r\nmovement. The Continent might for a time hang back. It might at first\r\nbe found impracticable to enlist for such a project the phlegmatic\r\nGermans. But practical England and her dependencies, as well as the\r\nacute Americans, would hail such a project: and after a while all\r\nother sections of _Israel_ would join.”\r\n\r\nWe may appropriately pause at this point to consider the attitude of\r\nEnglish Jews to the conflicting ideas of Zionism and assimilation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\n                    ZIONISM _VERSUS_ ASSIMILATION\r\n\r\n    The first difficulties――The traditions of Anglo-Jewry――The\r\n    influence of the English people on the Jews――Assimilation and\r\n    the Jewish National idea――The Zionist conception of the Jewish\r\n    problem――The tragedy of a minority.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN order that Zionism might be prevented from becoming a metaphysical\r\ntheory instead of a practical principle, and might achieve\r\nconcreteness and real life, it was most advisable that its development\r\nshould proceed by steady and slow degrees, that it should meet with\r\nopposition at every step and be challenged to produce logical proof\r\nof its soundness. For it is only after antagonism has been overcome\r\nthat truth reigns triumphant in the human mind. There is consequently\r\nno cause to regret that Zionism met with opposition among the Jews\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nAt the time with which we are dealing――the sixties of last century――a\r\nnumber of Jews in some countries of Western Europe already showed a\r\ndesire to assimilate with their fellow-countrymen in every possible\r\nway. This desire arises merely from a confusion of aspirations and\r\nideas. It is of course natural for a Jew born in England to be proud\r\nof being an English citizen, for a Jew born in France, Italy or\r\nelsewhere to be proud of the greatness and progress of his native\r\nland. Everybody thoroughly understands and appreciates this sentiment.\r\nThere are few feelings more noble than patriotism, and few have been\r\nresponsible for greater deeds and more heroic achievements. It is a\r\ngood thing when the “_amour sacre de la patrie_” fills one’s breast.\r\nBut a Jew may be a good and loyal citizen and yet a thoroughly\r\nnational Jew. The two things are in no way incompatible, and have\r\nbeen made to appear so only by inaccuracy in definition, and failure\r\nto understand the difference between ethnological and religious\r\nnationality on the one hand, and political nationality on the other.\r\n\r\nThe Jews are a nation, although they have not retained their full\r\nnational status. Most non-Jews, whether they are anti-or pro-Jews,\r\nregard Judaism as a national tie, and if well-wishers hesitate to\r\nexpress this opinion it is only for fear of hurting the feelings\r\nof those Jews who wish to be thought merely a religious community.\r\nDelicate natures shrink from incurring the suspicion of anti-Semitism,\r\nand comply from conscious or unconscious kindliness with this singular\r\nwish of a few Jews. So this minority has contrived to suggest to many\r\nChristians a view which, in reality, they do not share at all, and\r\nwhich will not stand careful scrutiny. The best proof of the national\r\nquality of a given community is the conviction of the outside world\r\nthat it is a nation. Whether the Jews are an absolutely pure race\r\nor not (absolute purity does not exist, but relatively the Jews\r\nare doubtless the purest race among civilized nations), they have\r\na specific past, a peculiar temperament, a special mentality, which\r\npersist even when the Jewish religion has long ceased to be a living\r\nforce, and make the most assimilated Jews a nation. And so it will\r\nremain, for, on the whole, the Jews are a tenacious people, and\r\nwithstand extreme tendencies to assimilation. When some assimilated\r\nJews, who really believe in nothing, call themselves genuine Teutons,\r\nLatins, _etc._, of the Jewish faith, it may be psychologically\r\ninteresting to close observers, but it is in reality only an\r\nunconscious impulse on the part of self-despairing Judaism to survive\r\nin any shape whatsoever. And these assimilationists have never\r\nbeen――though the Jews have gone through greater and more extensive\r\nperiods of assimilation than the present――more than a handful.\r\n\r\nOf course the national force of present-day Judaism is in a latent\r\nstate, and it can only become manifest when Judaism resumes its\r\nhistory. The Jewish nation has the cultural power to attain that goal,\r\nto form a national community, to maintain it and to make it prosper.\r\nIts intellectual and ethical aptitudes are denied by none but the\r\nmalevolent and the envious. One cannot glance into the history of\r\ncivilized nations, and of civilization itself, without meeting at\r\nevery point with men of Jewish race who have achieved great things\r\nin poetry and science, in economics and politics.\r\n\r\n“Yours is a mighty genius,” the French statesman Ernest Laharanne\r\nwrote in 1860, “and we bow before you. You were strong in the days\r\nof antiquity, and strong in the Middle Ages. You have preserved your\r\nexistence throughout the dispersion, of course not without paying the\r\nheavy tax of eighteen centuries of persecution. But the remainder is\r\nstill strong enough to erect anew the gates of _Jerusalem_. This is\r\nyour task.”¹\r\n\r\n    ¹ _La Nouvelle Question d’Orient_, _ibid._\r\n\r\nOrientals through their inherited aptitudes of intellect and mind,\r\nOccidentals through eighteen centuries of education, the Jews are\r\nthe only qualified intermediaries for the great work which is to\r\nbegin with the civilizing of the peoples of Asia and to end with the\r\nconciliation of the races.\r\n\r\nWhat is _nationally_ Jewish? The word _national_ implies racial unity\r\nnot merely in the sense of a common origin, but as a present fact and\r\nan abiding influence, with a particular fervour and strength of its\r\nown. This racial unity has its psychological counterpart in a certain\r\nintense racial spirit, by virtue of which the whole nation is animated\r\nby a definite aspiration towards a common ideal, and becomes merged\r\nwith it into a _living unit_. This characteristic spirit permeates the\r\nwhole people “like a salve, and causes it to glow as with one flame.”\r\nOr in the words of the _Zohar_:――\r\n\r\n“_Israel_ and its _Torah_ are one.”¹ This _Torah_ is precisely the\r\nethos of the fundamental racial unity of the Jews.\r\n\r\n    ¹‏ ג׳ דרגין מתקשרן דא בדא ק״בח אורייתא וישׁראל ספר הזהר חלק ן אחרי מות דף ענ\r\n\r\nTo the singular and exceptional nature of the Jewish nationality is\r\ndue the fact that it is frequently difficult to determine with any\r\ndegree of exactitude in how far certain terms and assertions which are\r\napplied to other nations may properly be applied to the Jews. Hence,\r\nwhile it is a matter of the greatest importance for the preservation\r\nof the full and precise significance of Judaism to use the most\r\ndefinite and unequivocal expressions in speaking of Jewish nationality,\r\nit inevitably happens that certain terms as used by the upholders\r\nof assimilation have to be characterized as inaccurate because their\r\nordinary connotation is misleading, though they may in themselves be\r\nlegitimate. An examination of the whole series of phrases which occur\r\nin the polemics of nationalism and assimilation would take us too far;\r\nbut it will be worth while to draw attention to certain fundamental\r\nprinciples in the discussion of which misunderstandings frequently\r\narise.\r\n\r\nIn any attempt to define Jewish nationality, it is necessary first of\r\nall to bear in mind that the only elements of nationality that enter\r\ninto consideration are the historical and the ethnographical. The\r\npredicates of the conception of nationality as applied to all other\r\nnations fall under the headings:\r\n\r\n    (1) Origin, historical solidarity, racial characteristics.\r\n\r\n    (2) State organization, political functions and civic\r\n        interests.\r\n\r\nThe predicates of the first category alone are germane to our subject.\r\nThose of the second category are partly inapplicable (political\r\nunion, political functions), and partly limited in their application,\r\nfor example, to the sphere of local interests. In this connection\r\nattention may be drawn to the fact that the local organization of the\r\nJews is strong and well-marked wherever the state or society drives\r\nthe Jews, by means of exceptional laws, ostracism or prejudice, to\r\nan instinctive or organized self-defence, and is absent only where\r\nthe Jews enjoy complete emancipation not only in the eyes of the law,\r\nbut also in the view of public opinion as a whole, and not merely in\r\nthat of certain of the upper classes which are everywhere more or less\r\nprivileged.¹\r\n\r\n    ¹ The desire to remove this sort of separatism was the\r\n      fundamental idea of the _Alliance Israélite Universelle_.\r\n\r\nExceptional laws tend to isolate the Jews; the attacks and accusations\r\ndirected against them collectively, the differential treatment meted\r\nout to them, the anti-Semitic policy, all necessarily contribute\r\nto strengthen the walls of the _Ghetto_. Every discrimination made\r\nagainst the Jews, be it only the merest _chicane_, is a stone added\r\nto the walls of the _Ghetto_. It is not to the Jews that the erection\r\nof a “State within a State” is to be credited; it is the anti-Semitic\r\nmovement which is responsible for this anomaly. As soon as the Jews\r\nare subjected to differential treatment, they must likewise alter\r\ntheir attitude. Whether they will or no, there arises out of these\r\nconditions a complex of problems in consequence of the instinct for\r\nself-preservation, which acts with the force of an iron law. These\r\nproblems, which in their origin have nothing to do with the national\r\nlife and character of the Jews, invest them with the character of a\r\npolitico-economic nationality, artificially isolated within the State.\r\nThat is a kind of nationality to which the Jews do not aspire; it is\r\nforced on them from without. And it is in such conditions that the\r\nmajority of the Jews live. It is a superficial method of computation\r\nwhich estimates the condition of the Jews according to the majority of\r\nthe countries in which they live; the right method is to consider the\r\ncondition of the majority of the people. That is the decisive factor.\r\nA well-known Jewish author has taken the trouble to collect in a book\r\nall the laws promulgated against the Jews in Russia under the old\r\nrégime. These laws numbered more than a thousand, and subsequently\r\nthey were increased by many hundreds. This code of laws――a kind of\r\nanti-Bible――affects half of the Jewish race. The originators of these\r\nspecial laws have consciously or unconsciously bestowed upon the Jews\r\nthe predicates of a nationality within the domain of the State, but in\r\na negative sense and with (as it were) _inverted_ political rights. A\r\ngroup of men may thus be converted into a nation isolated within the\r\nState, not only by granting them special privileges, but also, and\r\nperhaps more thoroughly, by subjecting them to special restrictions.\r\n\r\nAs an inevitable result of this treatment, the thoughts, feelings and\r\naspirations, the daily interests, the public opinion, the collective\r\nwill of the Jewish masses have been driven to assume a tendency\r\nnecessarily peculiar to themselves even in economic and general\r\nquestions, in which they would otherwise have no special concern as\r\nJews. In spite of the exceptional conditions artificially created for\r\nthem they yet contrive on the whole to maintain their loyalty to the\r\nState, and make supreme sacrifices for it.\r\n\r\nIt stands to reason that when, in the course of one generation, a\r\ncertain class of men has been called upon to suffer the martyrdom of\r\nviolent persecutions and is constantly threatened by this gruesome\r\nspectre, the consequence is that whether they will or no, the members\r\nof the group become welded and cemented together into one body.\r\nIt is also self-evident that given a certain class of men confined\r\nwithin a _Ghetto_ or debarred from many professions――only a few in\r\nfact remaining open to them――the members of the community are bound\r\nto become a people of entirely exceptional character, with cares\r\nand problems of their own. In our day, as on innumerable previous\r\noccasions in Jewish history, malice makes use of this fact to bring\r\nforward fresh accusations against the Jew. The Jews are driven into\r\ncertain positions, and are then held responsible for them. It is of\r\nno avail to give serious consideration to these charges. They are so\r\nnumerous and so obstinate that it would be impossible to dispose of\r\nthem all in an apology. Impartial observers will understand that the\r\nexceptional status of the Jews within the States, and the separate\r\ninterests resulting therefrom, were not a consummation desired by\r\nthe Jews, but a necessity imposed upon them against their will and of\r\nwhich they are compelled to bear the consequences. They are obliged\r\nto combine in many countries, just as any people taken collectively\r\nusually combine, when their interests as a collective body are at\r\nstake. This is a necessity even in the most ordinary matters of daily\r\nlife, and it results in a national combination for economic interests,\r\nas, for instance, in the case of boycott or of social ostracism. But\r\nfor these aggravations, it would not occur to the most zealous of\r\nJewish nationalists to make attempts at organization in this direction.\r\nThe distinctive Jewish national concept is not embodied in these\r\norganizations, nor dependent upon them. But the demand that these\r\nspecial organizations shall cease, is first of all a chimera: and\r\nsecondly an injustice: a chimera because it transgresses the law of\r\nthe instinct of self-preservation, and an injustice because one must\r\nnot forbid a man who has been attacked to defend himself. One can only\r\ndemand that the grievances shall be removed. Whether they will ever\r\nvanish, and when, is another question. The Russian revolution, with\r\nits boon of freedom to oppressed nationalities, will mark, we hope,\r\nan epoch in the struggle of the Jewish masses for the right to live\r\nfreely in the political and economic sense. But history and experience\r\nwarn us against believing too readily that salvation has come.\r\n\r\nHowever that may be, Jewish nationality, as we said above, in no\r\nway depends on the political status and the position of the Jews\r\nin various countries. This question may be left entirely out of\r\nconsideration. In dealing with Jewish nationality, we are concerned\r\nonly with those predicates which are based upon the _natio_, that is\r\nthe origin and the spirit or type of the race in question.\r\n\r\nThe Jewish national idea is not merely an historical tradition,\r\nit is a programme for outward as well as inward use. Outwardly it\r\nmanifests itself in an energetic struggle for its own existence, in\r\nthe development of its self-consciousness, in an active regard for\r\nits own interests; inwardly as a union of the Jews of all countries,\r\nrites, grades of culture and political parties on all questions which\r\naffect Jews and Judaism (though it is and must be set on one side in\r\nall non-Jewish questions relating to the State). As in the _natio_\r\nthe fact of being at one with the race is the really characteristic\r\nfeature, it is necessary to regard all Jews as members of the Jewish\r\nnationality without reference to their religious opinions or points of\r\nview. This is the meaning of the _Talmudic_ dictum:――\r\n\r\n                          אף על פי שחטא ישראל הוא\r\n                     סנהדרין דף מד ע׳א׃¹\r\n\r\n    ¹ Although he sinned he is an Israelite.――Sanhedrin 44ᵃ.\r\n\r\nNationality has nothing to do with the differences of theological\r\nopinion between the various sections of Jewry; it is based simply\r\nupon oneness with the race. The endeavour to form this union is the\r\nfoundation of the national idea.\r\n\r\nBy those who do not understand it the Jewish national idea is\r\nreproached with constituting an antithesis to the idea of the\r\nState and of citizenship on the one hand, and to the spiritual and\r\nthe _Torah_ on the other. This reproach has no foundation: Jewish\r\nnationality cannot find expression in political citizenship in the\r\nDiaspora, simply because it lies outside that sphere. On the other\r\nhand, from the point of view of the inner, spiritual strength of\r\nJewry, the sense of nationality is a source of vitality, and produces\r\na fusion which transcends all parties. It is folly to regard it as a\r\ndegradation of the spiritual character of Judaism.\r\n\r\nThose who were unable to comprehend this distinction, and could not\r\nor would not recognize the true nobility of their Jewish nationality,\r\nwere impelled by a desire to destroy the distinctive characteristics\r\nwhich recalled their origin. They wished to submerge their nationality,\r\nglorious in tradition and history, illustrious in its record of\r\nheroism, venerable in its antiquity, holy by the inspiration of\r\nreligion. They failed to see that their people’s history abounded in\r\nevents and incidents sufficient not only to stamp a nation as glorious,\r\nbut to confer upon themselves, as men and as citizens in the countries\r\nof their birth, greater dignity, more native worth and integrity\r\nof purpose. They forgot that assimilation involved the sacrifice\r\nof a glorious historical tradition, of a living national sentiment,\r\nand, worst of all, of their national genius. However, the pursuit of\r\nassimilation did not always extend to a desire for total absorption;\r\nits effect was to weaken rather than to destroy.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of assimilation was not adopted in its fulness by the\r\nJews in England. This was due to the influence of the English nation.\r\nJews in England could not fail to see the attachment of Englishmen\r\nto time-honoured political observances, sometimes meaningless in\r\nthemselves, yet full of significance through their symbolism or\r\nassociations; that strong under-current of traditional feeling which,\r\nthough held in check by the swifter stream of progress, manifests its\r\npresence and power in a dignified reverence for the past. With such\r\nfellow-countrymen as the British people, in a land whose greatness is\r\nbuilt on the past, on tradition, on the Bible, the Jews had no need to\r\nbe ashamed of pointing to their own traditions, of dwelling upon their\r\nown history and the glory of their own past. The Jews, whose history\r\nis an epic, had no need to slur over that chapter of the poem whose\r\nscenes are laid in the Holy Land. They knew that the ancient glory\r\nof their annals shone brightly on those sacred shores. They knew\r\nthat that holy soil had been trodden by the prophets, the poets, and\r\nthe warriors of their race, and that there they had first impressed\r\nthemselves on their age and on the ages which were to follow. They\r\nknew that amid the most splendid states of antiquity or of the modern\r\nworld no land had produced such brilliant examples of valour, wisdom\r\nand virtue; that no land had ever rendered more wonderful services to\r\nthe world than this Holy Land of theirs; that no land had ever had so\r\ngreat a past. And though the future is wrapped in darkness, national\r\nhope sees a glimmer of promise even through the veil of mist.\r\n\r\nEnglish Jews understood, then, that the relationship of the Jewish\r\npeople to the Holy Land was a tie of a peculiar character. They\r\nunderstood that in ordinary circumstances the connection between an\r\nexiled people and its land would probably have been severed long ago.\r\nIt could hardly have resisted the influences that had been at work to\r\nbring about its dissolution. Everybody knows of numerous instances of\r\nsuch dissolution recorded in history. When a people, or a section of\r\na people, leaves the country which was the cradle of its nationality\r\nto live in a distant clime, under the ægis of new institutions, the\r\nlink that bound it to the ancient soil loosens and gives way in course\r\nof time and by force of events. At first old associations assert\r\nthemselves. Familiar names are resumed on the unfamiliar shore. The\r\nfollowers of Cadmus (_fl._ 1493 _b.c.e._) planted a new Thebes in the\r\nland to which they migrated. The Pilgrim Fathers raised a new Plymouth\r\non the shore which the _Mayflower_ touched at the end of its outward\r\nvoyage from the Plymouth of the motherland. For long years the\r\nAmerican exile called the old country his home. But even this feeling\r\nscarcely survives the changes of which we are witnesses. Generations\r\npass by. New institutions take root: new feelings prevail, they ripen\r\nand burst into fruit. There is no revolution more complete and more\r\nenduring than that caused by the transplanting of a nation. But with\r\nthe Jews and the land of their lost glory the case is wholly different.\r\nElements of a higher character than those of an ordinary historical\r\nnature enter into consideration. The Holy Land is the country of their\r\npast greatness, present longings and future hopes. It is a bridge\r\nwhich links the past with the future through the span of the present.\r\nIt is still a land of dreams, but it is to become a land of wakeful\r\nactivity, it is to be stirred to new life and progress. To carry out\r\nsuch objects combined, sustained and intelligent action is required.\r\nHow could English Jews, living amongst the greatest colonizing nation\r\nin the world, overlook this great necessity?\r\n\r\nNo other country under the sun can unite all the advantages which the\r\nrestored home of the _Hebrews_ will present, can attract the Jewish\r\npeople, with the knowledge which it has gained of the ways of the\r\nworld and its pre-eminence in commerce, can become the home of a\r\nCommonwealth which will restore its national greatness.\r\n\r\nFrom a purely practical point of view, again, there is no reason\r\nwhy property in the land of _Israel_ should not offer as safe an\r\ninvestment as any other. Surely it is within the realm of probability\r\nthat those who regard the idea as the ridiculous notion of a mad\r\nenthusiast, or at least their children after them, may find it to\r\ntheir interest to labour for the restoration of Palestine as the\r\nsurest method of placing their worldly possessions in safety, even\r\nwithout taking into consideration the benefits which would accrue to\r\nthe Jews as a religious community, through their obtaining once more\r\na home for the practice of their laws, a spot where the ark of the\r\ncovenant may rest without being exposed to malevolence and prejudice.\r\n\r\nThese ideas, in fact, were prevalent among English Jews. There were\r\nsome adherents of Assimilation, but they were insignificant both in\r\nnumbers and in influence. It is note-worthy that the idea preached by\r\nmodern Zionism in the first years of the movement, namely, that the\r\nJewish tragedy is due to the fact that the Jews are everywhere in a\r\nminority, and that therefore the only solution of the problem is to\r\nmake them a majority in their own country, was expressed in England\r\nby a Jewish publicist in 1863 (Appendix lxvi).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\n                     COLONIZATION AND RESTORATION\r\n\r\n    Henry Wentworth Monk――Zionism in France――Jean Henri Dunant’s\r\n    “Le Renouvellement de l’Orient”――Napoleon III.――Bishop Stephen\r\n    Watson――“L’Orient” in Brussels.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHILANTHROPY, not nationalism, was the basis of the “London _Hebrew_\r\nSociety for the Colonization of the Holy Land” (Appendix lxvii),\r\nfounded by Jews in 1861. This experiment, generous as it was, could\r\nnot succeed, even as a philanthropic scheme, because it lacked the\r\ngreat national idea, which is the soul and essence of Zionism, and\r\nwithout which no revival can possibly succeed. It is worthy of note\r\nthat an English Christian who was one of the promoters of Palestine\r\ncolonization grasped this truth; and addressed the following letter\r\nfrom _Jerusalem_ to the Jewish press in England:――\r\n\r\n    November 6, 1863. _The Jewish Chronicle and Hebrew Observer_\r\n                             (_p._ 3).\r\n        “Projected Agricultural Colonies in the Holy Land.”\r\n             “To the Editor of the _Jewish Chronicle_.\r\n\r\n    “SIR,\r\n\r\n    “Yesterday my attention was called to your editorial of\r\n    the 4th _ult._ by _Rabbi_ Sneersohn, who at the same time\r\n    requested me to try and explain why the poor Jews in this\r\n    country have not yet succeeded in earning an independence\r\n    by the cultivation of the soil, as poor people in other\r\n    countries generally do to some extent. He supposes that I\r\n    ought to know something about it, as I have been brought up\r\n    to farming in Canada, where poor people generally do succeed\r\n    in earning a good living by agriculture; and for about\r\n    two years (in 1854 and 1855) I also had some experience in\r\n    reference to agriculture in this country, where it must be\r\n    admitted that lately it has been far otherwise.... The cause\r\n    of the great want of success hitherto, it appears to me,\r\n    is, because people have not fairly considered the great\r\n    magnitude and importance of the object to be accomplished,\r\n    and seriously gone to work to accomplish that object with\r\n    that kind of earnestness with which men go to work to build\r\n    a railroad, or engage in any other great undertaking, which\r\n    they have decided would conduce greatly to the advantage of\r\n    the public, and for their own profit also.... When the Greeks\r\n    are making efforts to become a people again, and the Italians\r\n    or Romans trying to restore something of their former\r\n    greatness, shall _Israel_ alone be totally indifferent as\r\n    to whether they are a nation or not? The poor of Israel\r\n    have done their part――they have come here in thousands to\r\n    live or die, as God or man shall permit. Let the rich and\r\n    enterprising do their part, and then let us see whether we\r\n    shall eventually succeed even better than did the remnants\r\n    of the Greeks or Romans.\r\n\r\n                        “Very truly yours,\r\n                                        “HENRY WENTWORTH MONK.\r\n\r\n    “_Jerusalem_, Palestine, _Oct. 1, 1863_.”\r\n\r\nAt the same time the political idea was taken up in France by Jean\r\nHenri Dunant (1828‒1910), the author of _Un Souvenir de Solferino_.\r\nTechnically a Swiss citizen, having been born in Geneva, nevertheless\r\nin all his ideas he was French. In 1859 he launched the idea of a\r\npermanent organization of voluntary groups of humanitarian workers,\r\nand also of an international treaty agreement concerning the wounded\r\nin war. He then presented himself to Napoleon III., who became\r\ninterested in his project and immediately gave orders to his army\r\nto cease making prisoners of the physicians and nurses of the enemy.\r\nSoon Dunant organized an “Aid Committee” in Geneva, and shortly\r\nafterwards published his _Souvenir de Solferino_ (1859), which was\r\nenthusiastically received and greatly applauded. The philanthropic\r\nideas of his book were received with interest by many European\r\nsovereigns, with whom he was on friendly terms, through correspondence\r\nor conversation. He interested the Governments so much in his project\r\nthat various nations sent delegates to the International Conference,\r\nwhich was held in Geneva in 1863, when it was decided to establish a\r\nNational Committee. A diplomatic International Congress on the subject\r\nwas held in 1869 at Geneva, by invitation of the Swiss Government.\r\nThe treaty there drafted accepted Dunant’s project, and the formation\r\nof the Red Cross Societies was decided upon. Thus a single individual,\r\ninspired by the sentiment of kindness and compassion for his\r\nfellow-creatures, had by his own untiring efforts achieved the\r\nrealization of his ideas, and thus aided the progress of mankind.\r\nDunant was a statesman, and might have been a saint. His most earnest\r\ndesire was to carry the message of sympathy, faith and knowledge\r\nto the hearts of poor men and oppressed nations. During his zealous\r\npropaganda, in the course of which he edited pamphlets and articles in\r\nmany languages, and travelled continually through the whole of Europe,\r\nhe spent all he possessed, and for many years nothing more was heard\r\nof this modest and good man. In 1897 he was discovered in the Swiss\r\nvillage of Heiden,¹ where he was living in poverty in a “Home of Rest”\r\nfor old men. In 1901, when the A. B. Nobel (1833‒1896) Peace Prize was\r\nawarded for the first time, it was granted to the founder of the Red\r\nCross Society.\r\n\r\n    ¹ Died there October 31, 1910.\r\n\r\nThese biographical details are interesting in so far as they enhance\r\nour appreciation of the activity of this great man, who advocated\r\nalso the idea of the regeneration of the East, and the resurrection\r\nof Palestine by the Jewish people. Dunant was inspired more by\r\npolitical convictions than by religious emotion. He was a champion\r\nof humanitarian ideas in the political life of Europe, and he dealt\r\nwith the problem of the East and the Jews from this point of view. He\r\naddressed to the public an “Open Letter,” which, far from repeating\r\nthe older ideas and suggestions which had been put forth on several\r\noccasions in England and France, gave the impression of a fascinating\r\nspontaneity and originality (Appendix lxviii).\r\n\r\nA peculiar feature of so many Zionist writings is the writer’s\r\nunfamiliarity with what has been written repeatedly before. There\r\nis no reference to earlier suggestions and attempts, no allusion or\r\nreminiscence whatever. Every writer begins _ab ovo_; everyone makes\r\nnew discoveries. Is this due to the fact that there was no literary\r\nconcentration, no history of Zionist literature, no bibliography?\r\nPartly so: but the true reason was, in our opinion, the independence\r\nof the idea in all these writings. Every writer was impressed\r\nnot by what he had read――most of them had not read anything about\r\nZionism――but by the appearance of the problem as it presented itself\r\nto him. Everybody discovered the truth in his own way, and all came\r\nto the same conclusion quite independently. Henri Dunant planned out\r\nand calculated for himself all the details of his great scheme. He had,\r\nas we see, a clear political conception of Zionism; his style, too,\r\nwas lucid and pleasant. He had a wonderful faculty for disposing of\r\ndifficulties. Moreover, he started political activity, and was in this\r\nrespect a forerunner of Herzl.\r\n\r\nHe started his work in France. Different rumours were current at\r\nthat time (1866) in England about a great Zionist propaganda in\r\nFrance. “A curious and interesting movement has been in progress for a\r\nconsiderable time affecting the state and prospects of the Jewish race\r\nin all quarters of the world,” we read in an editorial in _The Morning\r\nHerald_, London (6th Feb., 1866). “It is of national rather than of\r\na religious character. As is well known, the generous exertions of\r\nSir Moses Montefiore in Morocco, Persia and elsewhere have greatly\r\ntended to ameliorate the conditions of the Jews locally, although\r\nthey are still in many regions persecuted and oppressed: but the most\r\nremarkable fact of all, has been the interview between the French\r\nEmperor and the leading members of the community in Paris. The object\r\nof this informal proceeding was, on the part of Napoleon III., to\r\nascertain how far there yet lingered in the Jewish mind a belief and\r\ndesire, that they might become repossessed of their native country;\r\nand certainly no idea, since that of the Crusaders, could be more\r\nromantic or bold, than one which should promise them through any means\r\nthe fulfilment of this ancient wish....” The author of this article\r\nconcludes: “Whatever our creeds, we cannot forget the good words of\r\nBishop Weston¹ when he said that, upon seeing a Jew, his best thoughts\r\nwere always carried back to the beginning and earliest blessing of\r\nthe world. Therefore it is with more than a mere antiquarian spirit\r\nthat we observe with sympathy the refusal of this race to raise,\r\nwhenever challenged to resume their lost position in the world, the\r\ncry _Hierosolyma est perdita...._” This rumour concerning an interview\r\nwhich the French Emperor had granted to the leading members of the\r\ncommunity in Paris was undoubtedly due to the propaganda of Henri\r\nDunant, who was a _persona gratissima_ at the French Court.\r\n\r\n    ¹ Stephen Weston (1665‒1742), Bishop of Exeter, 1724.\r\n\r\nThe appeal was afterwards re-echoed in a political paper started in\r\nBrussels under the title of _L’Orient_, which devoted much attention\r\nto Eastern affairs.\r\n\r\n“Palestine,” we read in one of the articles, “situated at the point\r\nof junction of the three continents, is the key of Asia: it occupies\r\na central position in reference to the East as well as the West: its\r\nsituation is the same between the countries of the North and South: no\r\nother on earth can in this respect be compared with it. What European\r\npower could take possession of it without bringing upon itself, on the\r\npart of the others, the most protracted and sanguinary wars? However,\r\none solution would still be possible for which, despite the rivalries\r\nand revolutions which keep the people of Europe on the alert, the\r\nway might be paved. The final solution of the Eastern question might\r\nbe accomplished if Palestine were reopened to the _Israelitish_\r\npeople. We have, further, to take into consideration the principles\r\nof nationality which in our days play such a prominent part: to bear\r\nin mind the isolated position of the Jewish people in the world,\r\nwhich has been dispersed among the nations of the earth for thousands\r\nof years without being absorbed by them; and to study the condition\r\nof the Israelites within the last seventy years, their wealth, the\r\ninfluence acquired by them in the commercial world, in industrial\r\npursuits and on Governments. The inference from all this will be that\r\nsomething grand is in store for the Jewish people. The return of the\r\nJewish people to the Holy Land may be considered from two different\r\npoints of view: the religious and the political. There exist several\r\nScriptural passages which predict the return of the Jews.... The\r\n_Israelitish_ people and the Arabic or Ishmaelitic tribes, which\r\nwith justice may be called the oldest nations on the earth, have been\r\npreserved by Providence, while the others among which they lived in\r\ncaptivity have disappeared from the stage of the world. We may depend\r\nupon it, the destinies of the Israelites, so unique and mysterious in\r\ntheir kind, will in the future be still grander than they were in the\r\npast: and they must be counted upon if we wish eventually to arrive at\r\nthe solution of the Eastern question, which appears so complicated.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\n                       APPEALS FOR COLONIZATION\r\n\r\n    A _Rabbinical_ appeal――_Rabbi_ Elias Gutmacher――_Rabbi_ Hirsch\r\n    Kalischer――Correspondence with Sir Moses Montefiore――Servian\r\n    Jews ready for Palestine――_Rabbi_ Sneersohn――Another appeal of\r\n    Henri Dunant――A committee in Paris under the patronage of the\r\n    Empress of the French――Zionism in French fiction.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN 1867 an appeal in favour of the colonization of Palestine was\r\naddressed to English Jews by two well-known _Rabbis_, Elias Gutmacher\r\n(1796‒1874) of Grätz, and Zebi Hirsch Kalischer (1795‒1874) of\r\nThorn. This appeal contains interesting references to a letter of Sir\r\nMoses Montefiore dealing with the same subject, to Servian Jews who\r\nwere ready to go to Palestine, and to the activity of the “Alliance\r\nIsraélite Universelle” in Paris in the same direction (Appendix lxix).\r\nConceived in an orthodox Jewish spirit, it seems to have produced\r\na favourable impression on some portions of the Jewish population\r\nin England; but it elicited few contributions. This is evidenced\r\nin another letter addressed to England by _Rabbi_ Sneersohn of\r\n_Jerusalem_ in 1866 (_Ab._ 8, 5626). “And now, my brethren in England,\r\nit is for you to be among the foremost in accomplishing the divine\r\nwill. Hasten to buy fields and vineyards on the Holy Ground without\r\nlooking for any immediate advantage. Do you not see that all nations\r\naround lay out large sums in buying up land here? Why should we\r\nnot follow this good example, when thereby great benefits would be\r\nconferred on our brethren here: for they would till the ground and\r\nthereby maintain themselves, and no longer depend upon charity from\r\nabroad? By this means also would hatred and sorrow be removed from\r\ntheir midst, for being engaged in their work they would have no time\r\nfor prying into the affairs of others. The time is most favourable for\r\nsuch an undertaking. About eighty heads of families, both _Sephardim_\r\nand _Ashkenazim_, lately bought fields along the road to _Jaffa_, and\r\nsome of them have commenced to till the ground. Who knows how soon\r\nthe ground will be worth double the price for which it can now be\r\nhad? There is now a large and most eligible piece of ground at a very\r\nreasonable price to be had, etc....”\r\n\r\n  Illustration:\r\n     _Rabbi_ ZEBI HIRSCH KALISCHER     _Rabbi_ ISAAC JACOB REINES\r\n\r\n     _Rabbi_ MORDECAI ELIASBERG          _Rabbi_ SAMUEL MOHILEWER\r\n\r\n     _Rabbi_ _Dr._ ISRAEL HILDESHEIMER      _Rabbi_ ISAAC J. RÜLF\r\n\r\nAt the same time Dunant continued his propaganda, and addressed the\r\nfollowing letter from Paris to the Jewish press in England:――\r\n\r\n    _Jewish Chronicle_, Dec. 13, 1867 (_p._ 6).\r\n\r\n                      “Palestine Colonisation”\r\n            “To the Editor of the _Jewish Chronicle_.\r\n\r\n    “SIR,\r\n\r\n    “Permit me to recall to your mind the remembrance of me. At\r\n    that time you were pleased to take a truly humane interest\r\n    in the work in favour of wounded soldiers, of which I am the\r\n    founder, for which I then laboured, and which still occupies\r\n    my attention. You are no doubt aware that this work has\r\n    been as successful as such a work of philanthropy can be. It\r\n    has obtained the adhesion not only of all the Sovereigns of\r\n    Europe, and even those of the Sultan of Turkey and Emperor of\r\n    Brazil (1831‒1891),¹ but also the unanimous suffrage of all\r\n    benevolent persons in all civilized countries.\r\n\r\n    “In the whole European and American Continents――both of them\r\n    liable to the chances of war――committees and societies for\r\n    the relief of wounded soldiers have been formed, and are\r\n    in activity, and it may be said, without exaggeration, that\r\n    the service rendered by this institution during the late war\r\n    surpassed all expectation. Official reports from this society,\r\n    as well as from military authorities published more than once,\r\n    have sufficiently shown it. At present, sir, I am engaged\r\n    in another work, for which I hope you will not feel less\r\n    interest than for that to which I have just referred, the\r\n    more so as it concerns Palestine, the country made over by\r\n    God to the glorious people of which you have the honour of\r\n    being a member.\r\n\r\n    “You will find enclosed two copies of a notice which a\r\n    committee formed in Paris for the Colonisation of Palestine\r\n    ――a committee of which I am a member, and which Her Majesty\r\n    the Empress of the French² has deigned to honour with her\r\n    patronage――have just published. The notice will explain\r\n    to you the object and tendency of our foundation. The\r\n    labours of your whole life, and the great merits acquired\r\n    by you in serving the cause, rights, and interests of your\r\n    co-religionists, inspire me with the lively desire to obtain\r\n    your valuable advice on the work on which we are engaged.\r\n    I hope that if you find our publication conformable to your\r\n    ideas, you will have the goodness to cause a translation\r\n    thereof inserted in the estimable journal which you edit, the\r\n    _Jewish Chronicle_.\r\n\r\n    “I also hope that you will likewise acquaint me with the\r\n    names and addresses of persons in England, whom you may\r\n    believe inclined to sympathise with the moral and economical\r\n    re-constitution of the ancient patrimony of the Hebrews; for\r\n    our work, supported by the greatest and most aristocratic\r\n    names among Christians, sympathises not the less, nay, before\r\n    all, with the Israelites, whose rights to Palestine are\r\n    superior to all others.\r\n\r\n    “I do not doubt but that the international sentiments which\r\n    animate you will call forth in old England, and among the\r\n    readers of the _Jewish Chronicle_, a sympathetic echo.\r\n\r\n    “Receive the assurance of my high consideration.\r\n                                      “(_Signed_) HENRI DUNANT,\r\n\r\n    “Founder and promoter of the international undertaking in\r\n    behalf of the wounded soldier, on land and at sea.\r\n\r\n    “Paris, 24, Rue de la Paix, _Dec. 3, 1867_.”\r\n\r\n   ¹ Dom Pedro de Alcantara (1825‒1891).\r\n\r\n   ² The Empress Eugénie, _b._ 1826.\r\n\r\nEvidently Dunant expected more from England and English Jews than\r\nfrom any other country in the world. The liberties and rights of\r\ncitizenship of the Jews have been more respected, and their social and\r\npolitical standing made more secure in this country than in any other.\r\nHere, at all events, the days of Jewish persecution have long since\r\npassed away.\r\n\r\nIn France, where a favourable atmosphere for Jewish national\r\naspirations had scarcely been created, _M._ Dunant’s scheme does not\r\nappear to have made much headway in a practical direction; but there\r\nis no doubt that his efforts were watched with sympathetic interest.\r\nWe quote again _M._ L. Lévy-Bing, who advocated the Zionist idea in\r\nseveral articles from 1864 onwards.¹ In French fiction _M._ Alexandre\r\nDumas (_fils_) (1824‒1895) had made one of the heroes of his play _La\r\nFemme de Claude_ a Zionist character (Appendix lxx). Many more such\r\nquotations could be traced, but we mention this only as an example.\r\nFurther, there was, at all events, the idea of Jewish brotherhood in\r\nthe creation of the “Alliance Israélite Universelle”: as we pointed\r\nout above, the activities of the “Alliance” were directed chiefly\r\nto the East, where it found a vast sphere of labour. All this was\r\nconsciously or unconsciously Zionist work.\r\n\r\n    ¹ In one of his last letters _M._ L. Lévy-Bing wrote: “Quant\r\n      aux destinées du peuple Juif, la restauration de ce peuple\r\n      est l’une des conditions essentielles du système divin. Il\r\n      n’est pas un de nos écrivains sacres, depuis Moïse jusqu’à\r\n      Malachi, qui ne parle du retour infaillible.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\n                   CHRISTIAN PROPAGANDA IN ENGLAND\r\n\r\n    A new appeal――Earl of Shaftesbury in 1876――Edward Cazalet\r\n    ――Laurence Oliphant――Zionism in English fiction――George Eliot\r\n    ――“Daniel Deronda”――The Jewish nationalism of Mordecai Cohen\r\n    ――A quotation from Dr. Joseph Jacobs.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN Palestine the Jews continued to cherish the hope of colonization,\r\nthough they had a hard struggle for existence. In a new appeal\r\naddressed to the Jews in England, _Rabbi_ Sneersohn describes\r\nthe situation in Palestine, and gives a clear idea of the efforts\r\npreviously made in the direction of colonization. This appeal is\r\nvery instructive as to the history of the colonization efforts in\r\nthe earlier stages (Appendix lxxi).\r\n\r\nAt the same time, while the Jewish organizations grappled with the\r\nproblem from the standpoint of charity, the great Zionist idea was\r\nagain put forth by English Christians. In the first place, Lord\r\nShaftesbury wrote in 1876 a most remarkable Zionist article, from\r\nwhich we quote a few sentences:――\r\n\r\n“Is there no other destiny for Palestine but to remain desolate or\r\nto become the appendage of an ambitious foreign power? Syria and\r\nPalestine will ere long become most important. On the Euphrates and\r\nalong the coast old cities will revive and new ones will be built: the\r\nold time will come back on a scale of greater vastness and grandeur:\r\nand bridging the districts the stream will run in the track of the\r\ncaravans. Syria then will be a place of trade pre-eminence. And who\r\nare pre-eminently the traders of the world? Will there, when the\r\ncoming change has taken place, be any more congenial field for the\r\nenergies of the Jew? The country wants capital and population. The\r\nJews can give it both. And has not England a special interest in\r\npromoting such a restoration? It would be a blow to England if either\r\nof her rivals should get hold of Syria. Her Empire reaching from\r\nCanada in the West to Calcutta and Australia in the South-East would\r\nbe cut in two. England does not covet any such territories, but\r\nshe must see that they do not get in the hands of rival Powers. She\r\nmust preserve Syria to herself. Does not policy then――if that were\r\nall――exhort England to foster the nationality of the Jews and aid\r\nthem, as opportunity may offer, to return as a leavening power to\r\ntheir old country? England is the great trading and maritime power of\r\nthe world. To England, then, naturally belongs the rôle of favouring\r\nthe settlement of the Jews in Palestine. The nationality of the Jews\r\nexists: the spirit is there and has been there for 3000 years, but the\r\nexternal form, the crowning bond of union is still wanting. A nation\r\nmust have a country. The old land, the old people. This is not an\r\nartificial experiment: it is nature, it is history.” Needless to say,\r\nthe political idea, as expounded in these sentences, could not have\r\nbeen put more convincingly by the staunchest Jewish political Zionist.\r\n\r\nA few years later, two distinguished Englishmen started propaganda\r\nwork on the same lines as Lord Shaftesbury: Edward Cazalet and\r\nLaurence Oliphant.\r\n\r\nEdward Cazalet (1827‒1883) was a man of great political ability.\r\nHe was a staunch friend of the Jews, and he knew the East. His idea\r\nwas that “wrong should be righted and freedom allowed a place in the\r\nworld.” He had a very high conception of Great Britain’s duty in the\r\nEast. His appreciation of a centre for “Jewish culture” is especially\r\nremarkable. Hardly a single point seems to have escaped him; he covers\r\nthe ground thoroughly, from criticism of the old English policy to\r\ndiscussion of the new Eastern problem, taking the question of the\r\nPalestinian population, the jealousies of the sects, and a hundred\r\nother things by the way. There are naturally a few debatable points in\r\nthis comprehensive treatise (Appendix lxxii). But as a whole it shows\r\nremarkable insight.\r\n\r\nA place of honour in the realm of England’s Zionism belongs to\r\nanother remarkable personality: Laurence Oliphant (1829‒1888). He\r\nwas a friend of Lord Shaftesbury, and had been a high official in\r\nconnection with Indian affairs, secretary to the Earl of Elgin and\r\nKincardine (1811‒1863), traveller, journalist, diplomatist and member\r\nof Parliament. He took up a scheme for colonizing Palestine with\r\nJews, and early in 1879 went to the East to examine the country\r\nand endeavour to obtain a concession from the Turkish Government.\r\nIn consequence of jealousies this attempt to influence the Turkish\r\nGovernment failed, and the scheme broke down, as did many others\r\nthat were launched about this time. He again took up the Palestine\r\ncolonization scheme in 1882. He travelled to Constantinople in the\r\nsummer of that year, and settled for a time in Therapia. At the end\r\nof the year he moved with his wife to _Haifa_.\r\n\r\nHe reports thus on his efforts in his book¹:――\r\n\r\n    ¹ The Land of Gilead with Excursions in the Lebanon. By\r\n      Laurence Oliphant.... Edinburgh and London, MDCCCLXXX.\r\n      Introduction, _pp._ xxxv‒xxxvi.\r\n\r\n“... Prior to starting, however, it seemed to be my first duty to lay\r\nthe matter before the Government, with the view of obtaining their\r\nsupport and approval, and I therefore communicated to the then Prime\r\nMinister and Lord Salisbury the outline of the project. From both\r\nMinisters I received the kindest encouragements and assurances of\r\nsupport, as far as it was possible to afford it without officially\r\ncommitting the Government. And I was instructed to obtain, if possible,\r\nthe unofficial approval of the French Minister of Foreign Affairs\r\nof the scheme. I therefore proceeded to Paris, and submitted it to\r\n_M._ W. H. Waddington (1826‒1894), who was sufficiently favourably\r\nimpressed with the idea to give me a circular letter to the French\r\nAmbassador at Constantinople and other diplomatic and consular\r\nrepresentatives in Turkey. I was also similarly provided with letters\r\nof recommendation from our own Foreign Office.\r\n\r\n“I would venture to express most respectfully my gratitude and\r\nthanks to His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales¹ and to their\r\nRoyal Highnesses the Prince (1831‒1917) and Princess Christian of\r\nSchleswig-Holstein for the warm interest and cordial sympathy with\r\nwhich they regarded the project and which encouraged me to prosecute\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n    ¹ Afterwards King Edward VII. (1841‒1910).\r\n\r\n“It appeared to me that this object might be attained by means of\r\na Colonisation Company, and that one of those rich and unoccupied\r\ndistricts which abound in Turkey might be obtained and developed\r\nthrough the agency of a commercial enterprise which should be formed\r\nunder the auspices of His Majesty, and have its seat at Constantinople,\r\nthough, as in the case of the Ottoman Bank and other Turkish companies,\r\nthe capital would be found abroad, provided the charter contained\r\nguarantees adequate for the protection of the interests of the\r\nshareholders.”¹ “It is somewhat unfortunate that so important a\r\npolitical and strategical question as the future of Palestine should\r\nbe inseparably connected in the public mind with a favourite religious\r\ntheory. The restoration of the Jews to Palestine has been so often\r\nurged upon sentimental or Scriptural grounds, that now, when it may\r\npossibly become the practical and common-sense solution of a great\r\nfuture difficulty, a prejudice against it exists in the minds of\r\nthose who have always regarded it as a theological chimera, which it\r\nis not easy to remove. The mere accident of a measure involving most\r\nimportant international consequences, having been advocated by a large\r\nsection of the Christian community, from a purely Biblical point of\r\nview, does not necessarily impair its political value. On the contrary,\r\nits political value once estimated on its own merits and admitted,\r\nthe fact that it will carry with it the sympathy and support of those\r\nwho are not usually particularly well versed in foreign politics is\r\ndecidedly in its favour. I would avail myself of this opportunity of\r\nobserving that, so far as my own efforts are concerned, they are based\r\nupon considerations which have no connection whatever with any popular\r\nreligious theory upon the subject.”²\r\n\r\n    ¹ _Ibid._, _p._ xv: “In his endeavours to obtain a concession\r\n      for an autonomous Jewish state in Palestine from the Porte,\r\n      Oliphant had the support of both Lord Salisbury and Lord\r\n      Beaconsfield.”\r\n\r\n    ² _Ibid._, _pp._ xxxii‒xxxiii.\r\n\r\nThese last remarks are particularly worthy of the attention of those\r\nwho, ignorant of the actual facts, are inclined to represent Zionism\r\nmerely as a theological or sectarian idea. There is ♦undoubtedly a\r\nstrong religious feeling underlying it, but the idea has been dealt\r\nwith, defended and propagated in England from all points of view.\r\n\r\n    ♦ “undoubedly” replaced with “undoubtedly”\r\n\r\n  Illustration:\r\n        _Rt. Hon._ JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN     EARL _of_ SHAFTESBURY\r\n         _London Stereoscopic Co._\r\n\r\n                             GEORGE ELIOT\r\n                       _London Stereoscopic Co._\r\n\r\n             JAMES FINN                 LAURENCE OLIPHANT\r\n\r\nLaurence Oliphant continued to take an interest in the question until\r\nhis death on December 23rd, 1888.\r\n\r\nAmong English writers who have understood the idea in all its depth\r\nand breadth, the place of honour belongs unquestionably to George\r\nEliot (1819‒1880).¹ She chose the Zionist idea for the theme of\r\nan imaginative creation, wherein she displayed unequalled depth\r\nof comprehension and breadth of conception. In “Daniel Deronda”²\r\n(1874‒1876) the Jew demands the rights pertaining to his race,\r\nand claims admittance into the community of nations as one of its\r\nlegitimate members. He demands real emancipation, real equality. The\r\nblood of the prophets surges in his veins, the voice of God calls to\r\nhim, and he becomes conscious, and emphatically declares that he has\r\na distinct nationality; the days of levelling are over. Where calumny\r\nand obtuseness see nothing but _disjecta membra_, the eye of the\r\nEnglish poetess perceives a complete national entity destined to begin\r\nlife afresh, full of strength and vigour.\r\n\r\n    ¹ Mary Ann (Marian) Cross, _née_ Evans.\r\n\r\n              ²‏ דָּנִיֵּאל דּרוֹנְדָה ספור כתוב אנגלית ביד ”גארג“ עליוט ונעתק לעברית על ידי דוד\r\n                     .פרישמאנן ... ווארשא ... שנת תרנ״ג לפ״ק ... 1893\r\n      (8º. 1 _l._ + 774 _pp._, in printed wrapper as issued.\r\n                                                   ([B.

M.])\r\n\r\nIt is a memorable book, written by an author devoted to humanity and\r\nto the deeper realities of English national life. Its atmosphere is\r\nfar removed from the conception of a materialistic world. Yet it is\r\npractical in a higher sense. It preaches a great idea. The Jewish\r\nnationality is represented as it actually is: not as an artificial\r\ncombination, but as an ethnological group which possessed the glory of\r\nindependence in the happier past and has been kept alive to hope for\r\nthe future by a deep historical consciousness and a lofty devotion to\r\nhumanity. This is a Zionist message indeed.\r\n\r\nThe wonderful completeness and accuracy with which George Eliot\r\nrepresented the Jewish character is particularly remarkable. The\r\nsketches of Klesmer and Alcharisi are triumphs of artistic skill.\r\nEzra Cohen is the embodiment of the successful commercial faculty.\r\nThe influence of the mother and the home on the inner life of the Jew,\r\nas described in the novel, must impress every reader. Pusti, the “Jew\r\nwho is no Jew,” typifies excellently the despised class of which he\r\nis a specimen. The more temperate Gideon represents a large section\r\nof the Jews who are neither ashamed of their race nor proud of it, but\r\nare prepared to let the racial and religious distinctions for which\r\nthe Jewish nation has fought so valiantly perish unexpressed. But the\r\ngreat character of the book is Mordecai Cohen.\r\n\r\nMordecai Cohen is a lineal descendant of three great spiritual houses\r\nwhich, in past ages, have waged a moral warfare in defiance of the\r\nwhole world against terrible odds; and the fact that those noble souls\r\nare descendants of the Jewish race affords ample proof of the physical,\r\nintellectual, and moral stamina which Judaism has always preserved.\r\nMordecai is the leader of a party which refuses to believe that\r\nIsrael’s part in history is accomplished, and maintains that Israel’s\r\nfuture policy should be to join the nations as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nGeorge Eliot explains the traditions, habits and characteristics of\r\nthe Jews with the affectionate accuracy of a delighted scientific\r\nobserver and with the fine enthusiasm of a humanitarian spirit.\r\nThe abundance of detail and the sensitiveness of the fine shades\r\nare marvellous. With subtlety, restraint and delicacy, without the\r\nexcitements of sensationalism, she succeeds in throwing into relief\r\nthe real Jewish problem. Something is passing away that once possessed\r\na life and value of its own. The labour of thousands of years is\r\nlost; a flame has burnt in vain, a fire is extinguished without having\r\nfostered life. There is a terrible sadness in it. The human soul\r\nturns to what has been the highest aspiration of its life. Mordecai\r\nhas a profound contempt for the arts of emulation; he wants creative\r\noriginality. His idea is to be wholly what he is partly, his own self,\r\nhis own self restored. He wants to live entirety at home, to live by\r\nthe work of his hands, to bring to maturity the ideas which he feels\r\ndeveloping in his mind. Where would this be possible? Only within\r\nan organization of his own people in their ancient home, in the\r\nmother-country of his own kin and ancestry, in a commonwealth which\r\nshould focus and embody the whole of Jewish life as it should be,\r\nnot ossified, dried, cut up, preserved in the form of saintly relics\r\nand adapted by interpretations and compromises to different zones,\r\ncultures and customs. He has, it is true, a great reverence for these\r\nsaintly relics, and――_faute de mieux_――in the Diaspora he feels it a\r\nsacred duty to preserve them. But he feels that this is not the ideal,\r\nhe sees that it is going to vanish, and therefore he longs for his\r\nhome, for a cultural entity working independently in harmony with\r\nsimilar entities. This and only this would bring the Jews nearer to\r\nthe world, nearer to humanity. Is this “nationalism”? In the absence\r\nof a happier name, let us accept this term. “What’s in a name?” In\r\nreality, it is human liberty; it involves no secession from the stream\r\nof common humanity. There is no aspiration more in harmony with the\r\nspirit and deeper tendencies of our age, more in accordance with\r\nliberty and justice, for nations as well as for individuals. This is\r\nZionist “nationalism.” No writer defends it more enthusiastically than\r\nGeorge Eliot.¹\r\n\r\n    ¹ The late Dr. Joseph Jacobs (1854‒1916) was more Zionist\r\n      than the Zionists themselves when he wrote: “Unless some\r\n      such project as Mordecai has in view be carried out in the\r\n      next three generations, it is much to be feared that both\r\n      the national life of the Jews and the religious life of\r\n      Judaism will perish utterly from the face of the earth”\r\n      (_Macmillan’s Magazine_, June, 1877, _p._ 110). This\r\n      opinion is rather too gloomy, and he took a different view\r\n      in later years. But his first opinion is significant.\r\n\r\nIn the Valhalla of the Jewish people, among the tokens of homage\r\noffered by the genius of centuries, “Daniel Deronda” will take its\r\nplace as the proudest testimony to English recognition of the Zionist\r\nidea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\n\r\n                 THE RUSSIAN POGROMS OF 1881 AND 1882\r\n\r\n    The new period of Jewish martyrdom――Public opinion in England\r\n    ――Mass meetings, questions in Parliament and collections\r\n    ――Protests from France, Holland, America and other countries\r\n    ――An instructive lesson――Emigration of Jewish masses――The\r\n    problem――The “Lovers of _Zion_.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE year 1882 was a turning-point in the history of the colonization\r\nof Palestine by the Jews.\r\n\r\nThe anti-Jewish riots and massacres which broke out in Russia in\r\nthe spring of 1881 had attracted attention to the position of the\r\nJewish people, but not to a degree commensurate with the importance\r\nof the subject. Just when it seemed probable that the martyrs of 1881\r\nwould leave no record behind them, new massacres occurred in 1882 and\r\nagain drew attention to the subject. All the English newspapers dealt\r\nsympathetically with the position of the persecuted Jews, and gave\r\nfull accounts of the atrocities. These articles caused an outburst of\r\npity and sympathy throughout England. Several mass meetings were held\r\nand funds were started. Questions were addressed in both Houses to the\r\nSecretary and Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs. This spontaneous\r\noutcry in England soon spread to all the countries of Europe. In Paris\r\nthe veteran poet novelist Victor Hugo (1802‒1885) headed the appeal for\r\njustice and pity. In Holland the University of Utrecht rivalled that\r\nof Oxford in its protests. Across the Atlantic the Government of the\r\nUnited States went further than any other Government, and entered a\r\npowerful protest in the President’s Message to Congress. All these\r\nmovements took their origin from the first emphatic outburst of pity\r\nin England.\r\n\r\nThe racial and national instincts which in times of prosperity often\r\nlie dormant in the hearts of the Jews were thoroughly aroused and\r\nstimulated by the cruel persecutions to which their brethren were\r\nsubjected. It was a terribly instructive lesson for those Jews who\r\nbelieved in the progress of humanity as a solution of the problem\r\nof the Jewish tragedy. They had a sudden and rude awakening. More\r\nand more the conviction gained ground among the people that the\r\nhelplessness of the Jew in his trials, his utter inability to stem\r\nthe tide of abuse and oppression, was chiefly due to the fact that he\r\nhad no land which he could call a Jewish land _par excellence_. The\r\nbest treatment that he received in free countries was only toleration.\r\nHe was always supposed to have the right of existence and of equality\r\nwith those among whom he lived, but in no case could he enforce it by\r\nstronger measures than an appeal to the goodwill and kindness of those\r\nwho could either give or withhold it. Appeals to the sacred principles\r\nof humanity and justice, beautiful and inspiring as they were, were\r\npractically futile. Renewed persecution brought these facts once again\r\nto the cognizance of the Jews.\r\n\r\nBesides, there was the visible fact of an enormous number of homeless\r\nJews who had no place of refuge anywhere in the wide world. For\r\nthe great exodus had begun. The necessity of providing the homeless\r\nwanderers with shelter was most pressing, the more so as it had to\r\nbe done without much delay. The persecutions grew in intensity, and\r\nemigration increased by leaps and bounds. The sufferers attempted to\r\nsettle in almost every part of the world. Every country objected to\r\nthe influx of so many immigrants, and more than one country prohibited\r\ntheir entry altogether.\r\n\r\nWhile most of the poor wanderers themselves struggled manfully to\r\nbrave the tide of poverty and of exile, the bulk of their brethren\r\nwho dwelt under more favourable conditions in other countries made\r\nit their business to devise plans for the succour of the exiled.\r\nFortunately for the immigrants, and to the credit of human nature,\r\nthere were noble-minded men in America who saw that there was work to\r\nbe done, and undertook it without hesitation, sparing neither expense\r\nnor trouble in devising measures for the alleviation of the misery of\r\nthe immigrants and for safeguarding them against the temptations and\r\nevils of a new country.\r\n\r\nThe immediate help which America gave was very important, but the\r\nquestion of the future still remained unsolved. The problem created by\r\nJewish emigration presents many difficulties. The tie that binds the\r\nheart of the emigrant to the soil of his birth is gradually weakened.\r\nThe attachment of the parents to the traditions of their native land\r\nslowly weakens. The children find new ties. The new surroundings claim\r\ntheir attention. The distant land of their infancy appears to them\r\nonly dimly on the horizon. A few years pass, and the old _Ghetto_ has\r\nbecome to them a mythical vision. Nothing, indeed, is so remarkable\r\nas the rapid absorption of English, Irish, Scotch, German, and\r\neven French immigrants, not to speak of some half a dozen smaller\r\nnationalities, by the ordinary American type. One would have expected\r\nto see citizens of the States learning to regard this continual fusion\r\nas a natural political condition, to reckon with it, to encourage\r\nit, to remove all difficulties out of the way of those who devoted\r\nthemselves to the task of bringing new immigrants into the “land\r\nof unlimited possibilities,” and of reconciling and harmonizing the\r\nnumerous heterogeneous elements. But there are men who do their best\r\nto hinder this great work, and thanks to their efforts, legislation is\r\nengaged in placing various restrictions upon free immigration. Jewish\r\nimmigrants in particular are still looked upon in some quarters as\r\nintruders. They are received with frigid looks not only by non-Jews,\r\nbut also by some of their own brethren, who have had the good fortune\r\nto settle in the country earlier, and have learnt to feel quite at\r\nhome. And it is not only the economic question which makes Jewish\r\nimmigration _en masse_ difficult: it is still more the question of\r\nthe national culture, religion and traditions of the Jews, which are\r\nendangered by assimilation. The question of bread, important as it\r\nis, is not the whole of the Jewish problem. The old Roman “panem et\r\ncircenses” could never become a Jewish principle. The Jewish principle\r\nis expressed in the words:――\r\n\r\n   “... man doth not live by bread only, but by everything\r\n    that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord doth man live”\r\n    (Deuteronomy viii. 3).\r\n\r\nNow members of other nations can find a home in America while their\r\nnation remains and develops its own life in the mother-country. But\r\nwhere is the mother-country of the Jews, of Judaism?\r\n\r\nVarious schemes of Jewish colonisation were planned and partly carried\r\nout in America at the time of which we speak. Some of them met with\r\nsome success, others proved utter failures. On the other hand, great\r\nmasses of Jews were inspired by the conviction that good results could\r\nbe expected only in Palestine from an effort to turn the exiled Jews\r\ninto agriculturists. That view was strongly opposed by others who,\r\nliving themselves in affluence, thought that they would always be\r\nsecure against persecution in the countries in which they dwelt. They\r\nconsequently thought that the Jewish problem could be solved only by\r\na real union between the Jews and their non-Jewish neighbours, by a\r\nprocess in which the Jews would cast off all that separated them from\r\nnon-Jews. They were blind to the fact, established by the whole of\r\nJewish history, that the more the Jew denies his distinctiveness the\r\nmore he is attacked and accused of it; and that whilst small groups of\r\nJews may sometimes succeed in getting rid of their dissimilarity, the\r\nJewish masses neither can nor will. They thought that Palestine should\r\nbe the last place for the Jew of to-day to think of, being under the\r\nmistaken impression that the Holy Land was unsuitable for colonisation\r\nand agriculture on a large scale. They argued from a technical\r\nstandpoint which had a bad foundation. They had no knowledge of the\r\nfacts, and Palestine was for them really a _terra incognita_. But\r\nthe masses turned with a unanimous impulse to Palestine. Everywhere\r\nsocieties of “Lovers of _Zion_” were founded for the realization\r\nof the cherished hope of making Jews once more owners of land in\r\nPalestine. Sometimes the idea was taken up with more enthusiasm than\r\npractical sense, and many hurried to Palestine in the belief that,\r\nonce in the country, they would find it easy to make a living. Not\r\nunnaturally there was much disillusionment, and many a bitter lesson\r\nwas learnt by sad experience. So it became incumbent upon the existing\r\nsocieties to keep the enthusiasm of their adherents within the bounds\r\nof sanity and practicability. The societies had to grope their way\r\ncarefully. They had to find out suitable localities for establishing\r\ncolonies, to direct the energies of those most fit to undertake\r\ncolonising work into the proper channels, and to check the efforts of\r\nthose who did not show the capacity for success and would only have\r\nproved a hindrance to the capable and the efficient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Illustration: DAVID GORDON            SAMUEL J.

Pinsker was educated\r\nat Odessa, where he studied law at the local Richelieu Lyceum. Law,\r\nhowever, was not to his liking, and he went to Moscow, where he\r\nstudied medicine and took the degree of M.D. He returned to Odessa\r\nand took up practice as a medical man. Shortly afterwards the Crimean\r\nWar came to an end, and Odessa was full of soldiers suffering from\r\ntyphoid fever. There was danger of an epidemic. Pinsker gave up his\r\npractice and devoted himself entirely to the stricken soldiers. This\r\nself-sacrifice was not overlooked by the higher officials, who brought\r\nit to the notice of the _Czar_ Alexander II. (1818‒1881), and Pinsker\r\nreceived a generous reward. Pinsker, besides being an authority\r\non medical matters, was one of the editors of the Russian-Jewish\r\npaper _Zion_. Educated as he had been in the dark days of the reign\r\nof Nicholas I. (1796‒1855), and witnessing the somewhat improved\r\nconditions brought about for the Jews by the accession of Alexander\r\nII., Pinsker believed for a time in emancipation and amalgamation;\r\nbut after long years of observation and experience he came to take a\r\ndifferent view. He was an eye-witness of the anti-Jewish riots in 1859,\r\n1871, and 1881; and in the latter year, he issued a pamphlet in German,\r\nunder the _nom de plume_ “Ein Russischer Jude,” in which he most\r\nforcibly expresses the conclusions he had arrived at. It was entitled\r\n“Auto-emancipation,” of which an English version appeared in London\r\nsome ten years later.¹ Self-emancipation was Pinsker’s great idea.\r\nNot that the idea did not exist before he preached it: as a matter\r\nof fact it is as old as Judaism. But Pinsker started his career as\r\na Jewish nationalist by giving renewed expression to this idea of\r\nself-help, and from that moment he kept it in the very forefront of\r\nhis aspirations and activities. Electricity is a comparatively recent\r\ndiscovery; it is only within the last half-century that it has come\r\nto be fully understood and harnessed for man’s purposes. But this\r\nmysterious power is not of recent birth; although unknown to man it\r\nwas latent in the universe from the beginning. In the fullness of time\r\ninquiring minds discovered it and gave us our modern triumphs of power,\r\nof lighting and of communication. The analogy, though weak, may convey\r\nto us in a certain degree what happened in the case of the idea of\r\nself-help. It had permeated the Jewish nation from the beginning of\r\nthe ages. The importance of free will and independent action had been\r\na leading Jewish principle from time immemorial. But it needed the\r\n“Lovers of _Zion_” and the advent of a great interpreter to bring home\r\nthe lesson to the Jewish people.\r\n\r\n    ¹ Self-Emancipation! The only Solution of the Jewish Question.\r\n      Translated from the anonymous German original, by Albert\r\n      A. L. Finkenstein.... London, E. W. Rabbinowicz, Printer\r\n      and Publisher, 8 Little Alie St., E., 1891 (_8vo._ 51 _pp._\r\n      [I. S.])\r\n\r\n      “Dedicated to Lieutenant-Colonel A. Goldsmid as a token\r\n      of esteem for his zealous championship of Palestine\r\n      colonisation.”\r\n\r\nSelf-help implies the duty of the nation to be on its guard and to\r\nuse its own endeavours to secure its position. It implies the moral\r\nobligation of self-defence and of self-salvation by one’s own efforts\r\nand sacrifices, without the assistance and protection of others. The\r\nprinciple comes to the surface over and over again in the Bible, where\r\nwe catch glimpses of a doctrine that is to be fully worked out only\r\nin the development of a national movement. The author of the Book of\r\n_Joshua_ strikes the keynote of _Israel’s_ duties when he says:――\r\n\r\n    “Be strong and of good courage;...” (Joshua i. 6).\r\n\r\n    “Only be strong and very courageous, ...” (_Ibid._ 7).\r\n\r\nPhrases similar to those in Deuteronomy xxxi. 6, 7, 23. _Joshua_\r\nobeyed the precept, and abundantly realized the promise with which\r\nit was accompanied. The historical sections of the Bible are filled\r\nwith this idea――every deliverance is attributed directly to the moral\r\nintegrity of the Jew and to the help of his God. It is remarkable how\r\nlarge a place exhortations to courage hold in the Bible; we cannot\r\neasily count the “fear nots” of the Scriptures. And these are not\r\nmerely soothing words to calm, they are quickening words, calling to\r\nconflict and to victory. This is the lesson which the individual as\r\nwell as the nation had to learn. In the light of it may be read the\r\nwhole history of Israel. The course of ages reveals a thousand ways\r\nin which Israel vainly tries to remedy the disaster into which it\r\nhas brought itself by relying on the aid of others. Now it was Egypt\r\n(Isaiah xxx. 2, xxxvi. 6), now Assyria (2 Kings xvi. 7), now their own\r\nkings and nobles. When threatened by the Syrians, they made treaties\r\nwith the Assyrians; when threatened by the Assyrians, they tried to\r\nstrengthen themselves by the support of Egypt. The proved uselessness\r\nof reliance on others brought the nation at last to recognize the\r\nvirtue of entire and obedient trust in God.\r\n\r\n    “Trust in the Lord with all thy heart,...” (Prov. iii. 5),\r\n\r\nwas a protest against self-sufficiency, self-conceit and vanity, and\r\nalso against relying on others. Entire reliance upon God, implied\r\nin the words “with all thy heart,” is here appropriately placed at\r\nthe head of a series of admonitions relating especially to God and\r\nman’s relations with him, inasmuch as such confidence or trust is a\r\nfundamental principle of all religion. The admonition does not mean\r\nthat men are not to use their own understanding, i.e. to make plans\r\nand to employ legitimate means in the pursuit of their ends; but that,\r\nwhen they use it, they are to depend upon God and his directing and\r\noverruling providence. For there is a true and a false self-reliance:\r\nthat which forgets God is ignorant and impious; that which recognizes\r\nHim as the source of all true intelligence is genuine and blessed.\r\n\r\n    “If thou art wise, thou art wise for thyself;\r\n\r\n    And if thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear it”\r\n                                      (_Ibid._ ix. 12).\r\n\r\nThis was a proclamation of the principle of personality, the\r\ngreat truth that each individual, in his single personality, has\r\nbeen endowed with full and equal rights of self-determination and\r\nself-control. The old civilizations annihilated the rights of the many\r\nin the privileges of the few, and put the manhood of the masses under\r\nthe heel of power. The very idea of common rights had scarcely dawned\r\nupon the minds of men. The grandeur of human personality, as complete\r\nand inviolably sacred in every individual, was not discerned. The\r\nidea, now so familiar to every civilized human being, that every man\r\nis entitled to all the rights of manhood on his own responsibility was\r\noriginally Jewish. The meaning of the verse quoted above is clear: our\r\nwisdom or folly is our own affair, both in origin and consequences.\r\nWe must reap as we sow, must bear the brunt of the conflict we have\r\nprovoked.\r\n\r\nThis principle concerns nations as well as individuals. The book of\r\nProverbs contains many maxims with regard to nations:――\r\n\r\n    “Righteousness exalteth a nation;...” (_Ibid._ xiv. 34).\r\n\r\nNational righteousness consists in the possession of a reverent\r\nspirit and the practice of justice, purity, and mercy. In this is a\r\nnation’s strength and superiority, for it will surely lead to physical\r\nwell-being, to material prosperity, to moral and spiritual advancement,\r\nand to estimation and influence among surrounding nations. The Pagan\r\nview of an eternal, inevitable force coercing and controlling all\r\nhuman action was in conflict with the Jewish conception of a free\r\nhuman and national will: man is not a helpless creature, borne along\r\nby destiny. Man’s moral freedom and responsibility is at the very root\r\nof all Jewish teaching, and is most strongly emphasized with regard to\r\nthe nation:――\r\n\r\n   “Is Israel a servant?\r\n    Is he a home-born slave?...”\r\n            (Jeremiah, _chap._ ii. _v._ 14.)\r\n\r\nA slave can be emancipated only by others, a free man emancipates\r\nhimself. Hope comes to those who rouse themselves from dejection,\r\nand “power to him that power exerts.” History proves the practical\r\nfolly, as well as the ingratitude and rebelliousness, of “Israel\r\nforsaking God.” When trust is placed in other powers they prove like\r\nEgypt――inactive, do-nothing (Isaiah xxxi. 7). The “captive daughter of\r\nZion,” which is a poetical image for the Jewish nation, brought down\r\nto the dust by suffering and oppression, is commanded to rise and\r\nshake herself from the dust.\r\n\r\n   “Awake, awake,\r\n    Put on thy strength, O Zion;...”\r\n                            (Isaiah lii. 1).\r\n\r\n   “Shake thyself from the dust;\r\n    Arise, and sit down, O Jerusalem;\r\n    Loose thyself from the bands of thy neck,\r\n    O captive daughter of Zion” (_Ibid._ 2).\r\n\r\nIn these words _Zion_ was exhorted to do her part, to put on her own\r\nstrength. What we term in modern language “self-emancipation,” the\r\nProphet, in his simpler phraseology, calls “Loose thyself.” When the\r\nbonds can be broken, break them; when the door can be opened, unbar\r\nit; when the way is clear, take it without hesitation and delay; and\r\nif this seems to be impossible, try and try again. God’s providence\r\nrequires of men, as a condition of his assisting them, their own\r\nefforts. When the Jews were delivered from Babylon, those only were\r\ndelivered who braced themselves for a great effort, left all that they\r\nhad, confronted peril (Ezra viii. 31), undertook the difficult and\r\nwearisome journey (_Ibid._ ♦xliii.) from Chaldea to Palestine, and\r\nmade all sorts of sacrifices. They saved the nation. A small beginning\r\nwas facilitated to some extent by the favourable decree of Cyrus, but\r\nthe most important and essential part was left for the people to do\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n    ♦ This is an incorrect reference. There is no chapter 43 in\r\n      Ezra, and I cannot identify what verse is actually meant.\r\n\r\n   “Put not your trust in princes,\r\n    Nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help.”\r\n                                          (Psalm cxlvi. 3.)\r\n\r\nThis psalm was evidently composed at a time of great national\r\ndepression, when the community, sick of dependence on the favour of\r\nforeign princes, turned more and more to the thought of self-help\r\ncoupled with a strong belief in the eternal righteousness and\r\nfaithfulness of the “God of Jacob.” It bears evident traces of\r\nbelonging to the post-exilic period, and the subsequent verses:――\r\n\r\n    “... The Lord looseth the prisoners;” (_Ibid._ 7)\r\n\r\n    “... The Lord raiseth up them that are bowed down;...”\r\n                                                (_Ibid._ 8)\r\n\r\nare an appropriate expression of the feelings which would naturally\r\nbe called forth at a time immediately subsequent to the return from\r\nCaptivity.\r\n\r\nThis idea was handed on as a legacy from the prophets and psalmists\r\nto the men of the Great Synod, and from the latter to the Jewish\r\nphilosophers and teachers of the Middle Ages. No doubt it had vastly\r\nchanged in form and in content; but in essence it was the same.\r\nPolitical independence was lost in course of time; and the place of\r\nthe political state was taken by national unity and an unshaken belief\r\nin the Restoration of the people to its old land. In substance it was\r\na combination of consciousness of the past and hope for the future\r\nthat made Jewish life in the present worth living. The sluggard was\r\nstill inert, the credulous man still trusted “in man in whom there is\r\nno help,” and had need of a live coal from the altar. But now it was\r\nnot an angel that brought to man the purifying agency. The sufferings\r\nof the nation had been exalted far above the coal of the altar.\r\nNational martyrdom had assumed a more intense and vivid meaning.\r\nIt was more insistently set over against the thoughtlessness of a\r\nmaterialistic life.\r\n\r\nWhen we read the maxim of Hillel _the elder_ (112? _b.c.e._‒8?\r\n_c.e._) which Pinsker used as the motto of his pamphlet:\r\n\r\n         ¹הוא היה אומר אם אין אני לי מי לי וכשאני לעצמי מה אני ואם לא עכשו אימתי׃\r\n                                           פרקי אבות א׳ יד׳\r\n\r\n    ¹ He used to say, “If I am not for myself, who will be for me?\r\n\r\n      And being for my own self, what am I?\r\n\r\n      And if not now, when?”\r\n                  (_Ethics of the Fathers_, _chap._ i. _v._ 14.)\r\n\r\nWe cannot help thinking that this aphorism, as well as the rule:――\r\n\r\n                  ¹‏”...ובמקום שאין אנשים השתדל להיות איש׃“ ב׳ו׳\r\n\r\n    ¹ “... and in a place where there are no men, strive to be a\r\n      man.” (_Ibid._ ii. 6.)\r\n\r\nrefers not only to individual matters, but also to national duties.\r\nSeveral centuries later, Bahia _ben_ Joseph Ibn Pakuda (_fl._\r\n1000‒1050), who devoted a whole chapter of his _Duties of the Heart_\r\nto the exaltation of trust in God, wrote:――\r\n\r\n“Trust in God should not prevent man from doing his utmost in the way\r\nof human effort and enterprise. Likewise it is folly to put too much\r\ntrust in benefactors, however powerful.”\r\n\r\nThe self-emancipation of the Jewish people is, accordingly, not\r\nsimply _a_ Jewish idea, it is _the_ Jewish idea. This idea is not\r\nof the _Ghetto_, it is truly _Hebraic_; it may be opposed to some\r\nsuperstitious notions, but it is religious in the highest sense.\r\nBelief in predestination tended to make many Asiatic nations lethargic\r\nand indolent. Fatalism killed their energy and stopped all their\r\nprogress. Relying on others was essentially fatalism. This doctrine\r\nwas Babylonian; it was never Jewish.\r\n\r\n   “Ethiopia and Egypt were thy strength, and it was infinite;\r\n    Put and Lubim were thy helpers” (Nahum iii. 9).\r\n\r\nThis was the burden concerning Nineveh, but _Israel_ trusted in God,\r\n_i.e._ in its Genius, in its own moral power, in its self-sacrifice\r\nand faithfulness to its ideals.\r\n\r\n   “That walk to go down into Egypt,\r\n    And have not asked at My mouth;\r\n    To take refuge in the stronghold of Pharaoh,\r\n    And to take shelter in the shadow of Egypt!”\r\n                                          (Isaiah xxx. 2).\r\n\r\n   “Therefore shall the stronghold of Pharaoh turn to your shame,\r\n    And the shelter in the shadow of Egypt to your confusion”\r\n                                          (_Ibid._ 3).\r\n\r\n    “Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help,...”\r\n                                          (_Ibid._ xxxi. 1).\r\n\r\n   “... Both he that helpeth shall stumble, and he that is helped\r\n    shall fall,\r\n\r\n    And they all shall perish together” (_Ibid._ 3).\r\n\r\nIn the period of the Second Temple, the Hellenists again made frantic\r\nefforts to be emancipated by the Greeks. The Jewish Law, which was the\r\nlife and progress of the nation, was for them the stronghold of Jewish\r\nunity and the obstacle in their path. But the more they strove after\r\nequality with the Greeks, the more futile seemed their strivings. It\r\nwas the loss of their faith in God and their nation that made them\r\ncast about for another power to deliver them. They preferred the\r\nattractions of Hellenic culture to _Hebrew_ morality; Syrian power to\r\nthe Divine Spirit; the material army of the Seleucides, whose forces\r\nthey could count and whose weapons they could handle, to the unseen\r\nmoral power of their nation. This was the sin of the Hellenists. When\r\ntheir success was at its height, they gave themselves with savage\r\nenergy to the persecution of those of their brethren who remained\r\nfaithful to their own nationality. With a zeal that far excelled\r\nthat of the enemy, they hunted to death the innocent followers of\r\nthe old prophets. But just when this persecuting fury was burning at\r\nits hottest, the _Maccabeans_ came forward and exhorted the “captive\r\ndaughter of _Zion_” to shake herself from the dust. Henceforth they\r\nbecame the blessed messengers of national self-help, and it was their\r\nchief joy to sing the glories of the Divine grace which enabled them\r\nto be more abundant in works than all others.\r\n\r\nWas not _Rabbi_ Akiba (50?‒132?) _ben_ Joseph the spiritual hero and\r\nmartyr, a preacher of self-emancipation? Did not the same idea inspire\r\nJudah Halevi [Abu al-Hassan al-Lawi] (1085(6)‒_post_ 1140), Moses\r\n_ben_ Nachman Gerondi [RaM-BaN]: Nachmanides: [Bonastruc _da_ Porta]\r\n(1194‒1270?), Obadiah (Yareh) (_circa_ 1475‒1500?) _ben_ Abraham\r\nBertenoro, and that splendid host of scholars who endeavoured to\r\nre-establish the ordination in Palestine, and to encourage the Jewish\r\nsettlement, in that country, amidst terrific troubles and dangers,\r\nas well as _Don_ Joseph Nasi [João Miguez]――(_circa_ 1510‒1579), Duke\r\nof Naxos, who spared no effort to help his brethren to settle in the\r\npromised Land?\r\n\r\nThis same idea lies at the root of Pinsker’s conception. A\r\nclear-minded and quiet thinker, he was deeply impressed by the events\r\nof 1880‒1881. The grave anxieties through which the Russian Jews\r\npassed, and the awakening of anti-Jewish feeling in Western Europe,\r\nparticularly in Germany, led him to reconsider the conventional\r\nEmancipation doctrine, in which he, like all highly educated Russian\r\nand Polish Jews, had formerly believed. Being a medical man, he may\r\nhave seen the tortures of the victims; as an old inhabitant of Odessa,\r\nhe no doubt remembered the anti-Jewish riots of 1859 and 1871; and\r\nnow the eighties, with all their horrors, began. He then enunciated\r\n“the message of political Zionism.”¹ “Pinsker, like all subsequent\r\npolitical Zionists, arrived at the idea of Zionism not through\r\nthe problem of Judaism――through the necessity of seeking for a new\r\nfoundation for our national existence and unity, in place of the\r\nold foundation, which is crumbling away――but through the problem\r\nof Jewry――through a definite conviction that even emancipation and\r\ngeneral progress will not improve the degraded and insecure position\r\nof the Jews among the nations, and that anti-Semitism will never cease\r\nso long as we have not a national home of our own.” Pinsker discovered\r\nthat the root causes of “our being hated and despised more than any\r\nother human beings ... lie deep in human psychology.”²\r\n\r\n    ¹ Zionist Pamphlets. Second Series ... _Pinsker and Political\r\n      Zionism_, by Achad Ha’am (Translated by Leon Simon), London,\r\n      1916, _p._ 7.\r\n\r\n    ² _Ibid._, _p._ 8.\r\n\r\n“We cannot know whether that great day will ever arrive when all\r\nmankind will live in brotherhood and concord, and national barriers\r\nwill no longer exist; but even at the best, thousands of years must\r\nelapse before that Messianic age. Meanwhile nations live side by\r\nside in a state of _relative_ peace, which is based chiefly on the\r\nfundamental equality between them.... But it is different with the\r\npeople of _Israel_. This people is not counted among the nations,\r\nbecause since it was exiled from its land it has lacked the essential\r\nattributes of nationality, by which one nation is distinguished from\r\nanother.... True, we have not ceased even in the lands of our exile\r\nto be _spiritually_ a distinct nation; but this spiritual nationality,\r\nso far from giving us the status of a nation in the eyes of the other\r\nnations, is the very cause of their hatred for us as a people. Men\r\nare always terrified by a disembodied spirit, a soul wandering about\r\nwith no physical covering; and terror breeds hatred. This is a form\r\nof psychic disease which we are powerless to cure. In all ages men\r\nhave feared all kinds of ghosts which their imaginations have seen;\r\nand _Israel_ appears to them as a ghost――but a ghost which they see\r\nwith their very eyes, not merely in fancy. Thus the hatred of the\r\nnations for Jewish nationality is a psychic disease of the kind known\r\nas ‘demonopathy’; and having been transmitted from generation to\r\ngeneration for some two thousand years, it has by now become so\r\ndeep-rooted that it can no longer be eradicated.”¹\r\n\r\n    ¹ _Ibid._, _pp._ 8‒9.\r\n\r\nThe great value of Pinsker’s doctrine does not lie in the fact of its\r\noriginality in literature. Original to him――he undoubtedly came to his\r\nconclusion by his own reflection――it was not a discovery in the usual\r\nsense of this word: views of this kind had been expressed before him.\r\nNeither does its great value lie in its possessing the indisputable\r\ncharacter of a scientific axiom. It may be said that although the\r\nJews are perhaps the most perfect example of a spiritual existence\r\nin dispersion, still they are not quite unique in that respect. Other\r\ndisinherited nations have existed more or less spiritually for many\r\ncenturies in a degraded state of national homelessness, “lacking\r\nthe essential attributes of nationality,” dispersed or dependent on\r\nother nations, and yet have not produced, even in a smaller degree,\r\nthat fear which is evoked by a “disembodied spirit.” It may also be\r\nurged that the Jews were hated and branded by all sorts of calumnies\r\nand malicious accusations [Apion (_fl._ 15‒54 _c.e._), Tacitus\r\n(55?‒_post_ 117 _c.e._)], mainly on account of their distinctiveness,\r\ntheir isolation, their different views and customs, and the inveterate\r\nprejudices of others――even when they had a land of their own. And\r\nalthough they may, and probably will, meet with the sympathy of\r\nsome nations, which are not entirely blinded by prejudice, and whose\r\ninterests may not clash with theirs, if they succeed in establishing\r\ntheir own home, still the supposition that they will no longer\r\nbe hated by others, plausible though it may be, cannot claim\r\nany scientific certainty. It must be remembered that, apart from\r\n“demonophobia,” which is undoubtedly an important motive, hatred\r\nof the Jews is continually stimulated by a deep-rooted religious\r\nfanaticism, by economic competition and jealousy, by racial prejudice,\r\nand that it is rather a _mixtum compositum_ of causes, conditions,\r\npassions, and interests too numerous to be destroyed by the removal\r\nof a few of them, and perhaps too various to be focussed in any single\r\nformula.\r\n\r\nBut that is not the main point. The psychology of anti-Semitism,\r\nas Pinsker formulated it, may be from a scientific point of view\r\nabsolutely true, or it may be open to some criticism: the finest and\r\nmost original achievement of Pinsker is rather that he was one of\r\nthe first Russian Jews to treat the Jewish problem as a whole, and to\r\ntreat it scientifically, while others deal only with fragments of it,\r\nand always in an apologetic spirit. The new synthesis, the new line\r\nof thought, foreshadowed by great minds in the past, but now fully\r\ndisengaged and standing clearly revealed as the beacon-light of the\r\nfuture, was, to our mind, not his formulation of the causes of the\r\nproblem, but his formulation of the programme――self-emancipation.\r\nPerez Smolenskin had voiced the demand of the Jewish conscience\r\nto maintain its historic tradition, and its condemnation of all\r\nthat spirit of assimilation that betrays it with new formulas or\r\ndeliberately denies it. Superior to Pinsker’s in being independent of\r\nthe way in which the Jewish people is treated by others――to Smolenskin\r\nthe fact of anti-Semitism was not one of fundamental importance――his\r\nmessage, eloquent as it was, suffered from being expressed in many\r\ndifferent books, mixed up with other subjects, and confined to\r\n_Hebrew_ readers, and thus cannot be compared with Pinsker’s concise\r\nand definite teaching. There were, however, many imperfections\r\nin that teaching. “Our great misfortune is that we do not form a\r\nnation――we are merely Jews.... And where shall we find this national\r\nconsciousness?”¹ How different Smolenskin and others, who spoke from\r\na secure tower of faith! “When he wrote his pamphlet Pinsker did not\r\nyet regard our historic land as the only possible home of refuge; on\r\nthe contrary, he feared that our ingrained love for Palestine might\r\ngive us a bias and induce us to choose that country without paying\r\nregard to its political, economic and other conditions, which perhaps\r\nmight be unfavourable. For this reason he warns us emphatically not\r\nto be guided by sentiment in this matter, but to leave the question of\r\nterritory to a commission of experts.”² He evidently saw in Palestine\r\nno more than a fraction of Asiatic earth, peopled by a certain number\r\nof inhabitants, while Smolenskin, David Gordon, and many others looked\r\non it as the sanctuary of the nation, the historic centre, whence came\r\nthe Jewish message to men, and the Jewish initiative in the world.\r\nPinsker, like many others after him, had not yet realized at that time\r\nthat one’s country is not merely a territory. Territory is only its\r\nbasis; country is the idea that rises on that basis, the thought of a\r\ncommon history that draws together all the sons of that territory. But\r\nin spite of all these imperfections, Pinsker’s pamphlet necessarily\r\nled to faith in a national revival and to Palestine――not because of\r\nits arguments, but because it was a wonderful human document. Earnest,\r\ntrue, without a trace of affectation, Pinsker’s appeal bore the stamp\r\nof great sincerity, and if there was in his pamphlet some of the\r\nspirit of the prophets,³ this was essentially in his cry for self-help,\r\nin his warnings not to trust in others, in his appeal to national\r\ndignity and energy. To superficial minds, the idea of this modern\r\nscientist unconsciously re-echoing the warnings of the prophets not to\r\ntrust in Egypt or in Assyria may seem exaggerated, but the apparently\r\nfar-fetched comparison is absolutely sane, for it is based on the\r\nsanest of all conceptions――the unity of the Jewish national idea\r\nthroughout hundreds of generations.\r\n\r\n    ¹ _Ibid._, _p._ 19.\r\n\r\n    ² _Ibid._, _p._ 21.\r\n\r\n    ³ _Ibid._, _p._ 21.\r\n\r\n“He came to take part in the work of the _Chovevé Zion_.... He\r\nunderstood perfectly well that their work was very far removed from\r\nthe great project of which he dreamt ... but when he saw a small group\r\nof men, with insignificant means, putting forth every possible effort\r\nto carry out a national project, small and poor though it was in\r\ncomparison with his own ideal, Pinsker could not help lending a hand\r\nto those who were engaged in this work, seeing in them the nucleus of\r\nan organization, and the small beginning of the national resolution.”¹\r\nHe encouraged and supported the work of the _Chovevé Zion_ (Lovers of\r\n_Zion_) as the first President of the Odessa Committee, and paved the\r\nway for modern Zionism. He died at Odessa, his native town, at the age\r\nof sixty-nine, on the 21st of December, 1891.\r\n\r\n    ¹ _Ibid._, _p._ 24.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XL.\r\n\r\n                    THE COLONIZATION OF PALESTINE\r\n\r\n    Jewish immigration into England――A meeting for the\r\n    establishment of Jewish colonies in Palestine――The foundation\r\n    of the Society “_Kadima_”――The Opposition――The opinions of\r\n    English authorities on Palestine――Col.

Many of these,\r\nignorant of the language and customs of this country, had to endure\r\ngreat hardships. Although some of them succeeded in the struggle for\r\nexistence under such unfavourable conditions, there were many others\r\nto whom England could not afford the prospect of gaining a livelihood.\r\n\r\nTheir difficulties were forcibly brought home to the Jews who lived in\r\nthe East of London. They had been eye-witnesses themselves, if not of\r\nthe persecutions, at least of some of their worst consequences. The\r\nfirst movement to remedy this unfortunate state of affairs began in\r\n1885, when a meeting was held for the purpose of founding a society\r\nfor the promotion of the Jewish National Idea, and the establishment\r\nof Jewish Colonies in Palestine. This meeting achieved no practical\r\nresults at the time; but it gave expression to feelings which were\r\nbound ultimately to lead to practical and useful action. Two years\r\nlater a society was formed in East London under the name of “_Kadima_.”\r\nMeetings were held at which papers were regularly read on some\r\nJewish national subject. But the members were much divided as to the\r\nbest method of realizing their aims. While some wanted the society\r\nto be nothing but an educational institution for the refugees who had\r\ntaken up their abode in England, others desired to extend the sphere\r\nof its activity, and to make colonization one of its main objects. The\r\nnewly awakened national consciousness had not yet gained mastery over\r\nthe inveterate national apathy, and was still groping in the dark to\r\nfind a basis for practical operations.\r\n\r\nThe enthusiasm manifested among the Jewish masses, important as it\r\nwas, could not raise sufficient means, and was unable to influence the\r\nupper classes. The old questions arose again: Is Palestine suitable\r\nfor colonization? What are the conditions of the soil and the climate?\r\nHow many people could be accommodated there? By what means could a\r\nchange in the conditions of Palestine be brought about?\r\n\r\nIt is strange how obstinately some Jewish opponents of the\r\ncolonization of Palestine strained against believing in the future\r\nof Palestine. To the past they paid in icy discomfort the tribute of\r\ntheir remembrance, for this past imposes no duties upon those who are\r\nalready quite detached from it in spirit. But the future! By denying\r\nthe possibility of a future one beguiles an elastic conscience,\r\nwhich longs to evade the apparent conflict between duty to humanity\r\nand national instinct. But it avails little to pay no heed to truth\r\nbecause it is inconvenient, for where historical facts and direct\r\nexperience point the same way, to deny them is but empty sophistry.\r\n\r\nThe opponents of Palestinian colonization could not deny that\r\nPalestine was once the “land of milk and honey,” but to justify\r\nthemselves they tried to make out that two thousand years of\r\ndesolation and neglect had laid the Holy Land waste and transformed it\r\nfor all time into an unproductive desert. No more fallacious idea ever\r\nobtained currency. True, Palestine is no longer the luxuriant garden\r\nit once was, for history has crushed it under an iron heel, and what\r\ntraces were left of its former richness lacked care and protection,\r\nso that disintegration and sterility took possession of the Holy Land\r\nas though it were a land accursed. Nevertheless, there is not the\r\nslightest reason to despair of a new development of the country, if\r\nonly the task of carrying out this new development be entrusted to\r\nthose who are willing to devote themselves to it, head, heart and\r\nhand, with the passion of patriotism and the zeal that springs from\r\nthe consciousness of a historic responsibility.\r\n\r\nThe appendices to this book contain many excerpts from the works of\r\ncompetent authorities, which afford reliable information as to what\r\nmay be achieved by a systematic and devoted cultivation. One may infer\r\nfrom these quotations, which are not in any way coloured by a facile\r\noptimism, what indestructible germs of future prosperity remain, in\r\nspite of all “_injuriæ temporum_.” If only an indolent administration\r\nand a lazy and retrograde population are replaced by capable national\r\nelements, the promise will be turned into a rich fulfilment. Figures\r\nand facts show too that notwithstanding all the unkindness of\r\nhistory, not only has the soil of Palestine retained its capacity for\r\ndevelopment, but trade has maintained itself, all things considered,\r\nat a high level. The ports of _Jaffa_ and _Haifa_ teem with traffic,\r\nalthough little enough is being done in harbour construction; and\r\nexports considerably exceed imports, which shows that, despite the\r\nneglect of centuries, the natural productiveness of the soil is still\r\ncapable of adjustment to present-day conditions. No factory chimneys\r\nbear witness to active industry, no convenient means of communication\r\nfavour trade; a phlegmatic, sparse population, entirely untouched\r\nby modern civilization, takes indolently what nature proffers,\r\nwithout any thought of supplementing it by its own endeavours. But\r\ngiven capable agriculturists, engineers and technicians, trained\r\nand enterprising merchants, and ample capital, how quickly could\r\nstagnation be turned into living and creative vigorous prosperity.\r\nThe idea of the colonization of Palestine is, moreover, connected with\r\nthe remarkable colonizing impetus which has taken hold of the entire\r\nmodern world. And, judged by outward characteristics, are the European\r\nmigrations to foreign lands, their colonization and development, so\r\nvery different from this feature of Jewish aspirations? Exuberant\r\nenergy finds no appropriate outlet in Europe, and seeks it far away,\r\nwhere it may be usefully employed for the furthering of civilization\r\nin the midst of backward countries and nations. Fruitful Jewish\r\nenergy, which is being kept under in the Diaspora, will be gathered\r\nand transplanted to Palestine, that it may prove true to itself and\r\nto the whole of civilization, like Antæus brought back to contact with\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\nStill, questions were naturally asked as to the condition of the\r\nsoil of Palestine and the possibilities of expansion. It was also\r\nrepeatedly asked, whether the Jews would be capable of hard pioneer\r\nwork in the sphere of agriculture. These questions have been answered\r\nin a series of ♦pamphlets and articles by such authorities as Colonel\r\nClaude Reignier Conder, General Sir Charles Warren, and others. They\r\nhave shown that Palestine is capable of supporting a nation such as\r\nthe Jews. Men who for many years had made the scientific exploration\r\nof Palestine their sole aim, whose judgment in the matter must be\r\nuniversally admitted to be decisive, have given testimony to the fact\r\nthat the land “may be made one vast garden, not merely by rebuilding\r\nthe great aqueducts, remains of which still exist, and by means of\r\nwhich the great cities were watered, but by means of the _Jordan_\r\nriver itself.” They also affirmed that “the time has at last arrived\r\nto restore the desolations of _Zion_, and to rebuild the wasted places\r\nof the land of _Israel_.” Some of them referred to the Scriptures, but\r\nothers dealt with the matter from a purely scientific point of view.\r\nThey suggested the formation of a company similar to the old East\r\nIndia Company to administer Palestine (Appendix lxxiii).\r\n\r\n    ♦ “pamphets” replaced with “pamphlets”\r\n\r\nIn brief, all these English Christian authorities put forward in the\r\nmost definite and clearest terms what we know as political Zionism.\r\n\r\nThese testimonies of English authorities concerning Palestine\r\nencouraged the “Lovers of _Zion_” in England to carry on their\r\nphilanthropic work, and also to take certain political steps. A great\r\nand far-reaching step was taken by them in 1893, when a petition\r\nto Abdul Hamid, _Sultan_ of Turkey (1876‒1909), was presented by\r\nMr. Samuel Montagu, M.P. (afterwards Lord Swaythling) (1832‒1911), to\r\nthe Earl of Rosebery, with a request to transmit it to Constantinople\r\n(Appendix lxxiv). The petition was signed by the officers of the\r\nExecutive Committee and the secretaries of each Tent of the “Lovers\r\nof _Zion_.” It had no effect, because negotiations with the Turkish\r\nGovernment are generally very tardy, and the circumstances of the time\r\nwere not favourable. There were obstacles, difficulties, uncertain\r\npolitical influences, currents and counter-currents which could not be\r\ngot rid of immediately. But at any rate the English “Lovers of _Zion_”\r\nendeavoured to do precisely what the Zionists did at a later period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XLI.\r\n\r\n             THE “LOVERS OF _ZION_” IN FRANCE AND ENGLAND\r\n\r\n    The work in France――Baron Edmond _de_ Rothschild and his\r\n    activity in the colonization of Palestine――The effects in\r\n    England――Colonel A. E. W. Goldsmid――Elim _d’_Avigdor.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO come back to France, it is significant that whilst England took the\r\nfirst place in the propaganda of the idea, its practical progress was\r\ndue to French Jewry, or, to be more precise, to an individual French\r\nJew. The work of the “Lovers of _Zion_” entered upon a new period when\r\nBaron Edmond _de_ Rothschild of Paris started his great activity in\r\nthe colonization of Palestine in 1895‒1896.\r\n\r\nBaron Edmond _de_ Rothschild is one of the most honoured figures of\r\nJewish contemporary history. Born to an exalted station in life and\r\nto a large fortune, he has devoted the best of his life and of his\r\nthought neither to pleasure nor to personal advancement, but to the\r\nfurtherance of the material and moral well-being of the oppressed\r\nJewish people. It is not too much to say that he has acquired a\r\nworld-wide fame as a philanthropist, and that his name is indissolubly\r\nconnected with all the greatest achievements of the Jews in Palestine.\r\nHe is pre-eminently the friend of the persecuted and the outcast,\r\nwithout distinction of nationality or creed, and his generous\r\nsympathies and ceaseless efforts on behalf of his brethren entitle him\r\nto the foremost rank in the illustrious roll of Jewish leaders. His\r\nphilanthropic enthusiasm can be traced to his profound Jewish national\r\nfeeling.\r\n\r\nRecent improvement in the condition of Jewish life in Palestine is\r\ndue to many causes and to the efforts of many men, but to none more\r\nthan to the noble work of Baron Edmond. He was not the originator\r\nof the idea of colonizing Palestine, but he carried it further than\r\nany of his predecessors or contemporaries, and he is responsible\r\nfor developments beyond any that they conceived. His activity should\r\nserve as the grandest example of what can be accomplished when work is\r\nundertaken for the sake of a great ideal and carried out with staunch\r\nconviction. The creation of a sound Jewish settlement in Palestine\r\nis his vocation and his life-work. Nor is it the least interesting\r\nfeature in his character, or the least honourable incident of his\r\ncareer, that the idea took hold of him at a time when there was\r\nevery reason for even a generous man to dissociate himself from such\r\nthankless work.\r\n\r\nBaron Edmond began to take an interest in Palestine at a time when\r\nthe doctrine of assimilation was still triumphantly making headway\r\nthroughout the whole of West-European Jewry. Under the guidance of the\r\npreachers of disintegration, Judaism was supposed to emancipate itself\r\nfrom the antiquated traditions of Palestine and from a belief in its\r\nfuture renascence. All this was to be altered. Neither the past nor\r\nthe future was to interfere with the present. All that Jewish leaders\r\ncould do to mitigate the lot of their unfortunate co-religionists\r\nwas――charity. It was in such a world as this that Baron Edmond found\r\nhimself when he first became a public character and a public force.\r\nBreaking away from the assimilation doctrine, he co-operated most\r\ncordially with the “Lovers of _Zion_.”\r\n\r\nHis activity found appreciation and emulation in England.\r\nRepresentatives of English Jewry, who were at the same time English\r\npatriots, supported the colonization of Palestine movement. One of\r\nthe most prominent “Lovers of _Zion_” and an ardent supporter of the\r\nJewish national idea, was Colonel Albert Edward Williamson Goldsmid,\r\nM.V.O. (1846‒1904),¹ a scion of an old and distinguished Anglo-Jewish\r\nfamily. He made the Army his career, and in January, 1869, after\r\nserving two and a half years with the Fusiliers at Walmer, proceeded\r\nto India with his regiment. He was appointed Deputy Assistant\r\nAdjutant-General at headquarters in 1889, and held this position\r\ntill 1892. In 1892 he accepted the responsible task of organizing\r\nthe Jewish agricultural colonies in the Argentine, and, having\r\nobtained a year’s leave of absence, he proceeded to South America as\r\nDirector-General. During his administration there enormous tracts of\r\nland were surveyed and parcelled out. About seven hundred families\r\nwere settled in four great colonies, the majority of whom, being\r\nquite ignorant of agriculture, had to be instructed in its first\r\nprinciples. The Colonies were organized on a system whereby, as the\r\ncolonists gained sufficient experience, the administration could be so\r\nmaterially reduced as to render the Colonies virtually self-governing.\r\nOn returning from the Argentine, Colonel Goldsmid was unanimously\r\nelected chief of the “Lovers of _Zion_” Association of Great Britain\r\nand Ireland.\r\n\r\n    ¹ מיכאל בן אהרון בן אלי בן צבי הלוי, son of Henry Edward Goldsmid\r\n      (1812‒1855), M.E.I.C.S., Chief Secretary to the Government,\r\n      Bombay, who in 1845 married Jessie Sarah Goldsmid. Her\r\n      paternal grandfather, Benjamin (Baruch) (1755‒1808) _ben_\r\n      Aaron (_ob._ 1782) Goldsmid was one of the pillars of\r\n      Anglo-Jewry, and a noted philanthropist in the early days\r\n      of the nineteenth century. Her father-in-law, Edward Moses\r\n      (_ob._ 1853), on his marriage in 1804 to Rose (_ob._ 1851),\r\n      a daughter of Elias Joachim, discarded his own, for the\r\n      maiden surname of his mother-in-law Esther (_ob._ 1811),\r\n      a sister of Benjamin Goldsmid. Maria [Mrs. Nathan Levien],\r\n      another daughter of Elias Joachim, was the great-grandmother\r\n      of Col. A. E. W. Goldsmid’s widow, one of whose daughters\r\n      is Gladys Helen Rachel, the Baroness Swaythling of\r\n      Swaythling in the county of Hampshire.\r\n\r\nAnother active leader was Elim Henry _d’_Avigdor (1841‒1895).¹\r\nBy profession a civil engineer, he supervised the construction of\r\nrailways in Syria and Transylvania, and of waterworks at Vienna. He\r\nwas the author of several works in connection with his profession,\r\nand had literary leanings in other directions. Under the pseudonym\r\n“Wanderer,” he published many hunting stories of merit, for which he\r\nwas well qualified, being himself an intrepid rider to hounds. At one\r\ntime he was associated with _Vanity Fair_; and afterwards owned the\r\n_Examiner_, and subsequently brought out the _Yachting Gazette_.\r\n\r\n    ¹ אדם בן שלמה בז יצחק שמואל, eldest son of Salomon Henri _d’_Avigdor\r\n      (_ob._ 1870) by his wife Rachel (1816‒1896), third daughter\r\n      of Sir Isaac Lyon Goldsmid, Bart., Barão _de_ Goldsmid _da_\r\n      Palmeira, of Portugal (1778‒1859) [son of Asher (1751‒1822),\r\n      the elder brother of Benjamin Goldsmid] by his wife Isabel\r\n      (1788‒1860), a daughter of his uncle, Abraham Goldsmid\r\n      (1756‒1810). _d’_Avigdor was a personal friend of Napoleon\r\n      III. (1808‒1873), who conferred upon him the titles of\r\n      Comte d’Avigdor, and subsequently that of Duc d’Acqua-Viva.\r\n      His father, Isaac Samuel Avigdor (1773‒1850), was secretary\r\n      of the “Grand _Sanhédrin_” (1807) convened by Napoleon I.\r\n      (1769‒1821), and represented the department of the “Maritime\r\n      Alps” in that assembly. He was the author of “Discours\r\n      Prononcé A L’Assemblée Des Israélites De L’Empire Français\r\n      Et Du Royaume D’Italie”; Par J. S. Avigdor (De Nice),\r\n      Secrétaire de L’Assemblée, Membre du comité des Neufs et du\r\n      Grand _Sanhédrin_. Paris, De L’Imprimerie De Levrault Rue\r\n      Mézières, 1807 (8º. 1 _l._ + 16 _pp._ [B. M.])\r\n\r\n      It may be noted here, that “A Jewish State,” issued in 1896,\r\n      was the English translation by Sylvie, the third daughter\r\n      of Elim H. _d’_Avigdor, of Theodor Herzl’s “_Judenstaat_.”\r\n\r\nHe was like Colonel Goldsmid, one of the first English Jews to join\r\nthe new movement for establishing agricultural colonies of Jews\r\nin the Holy Land. Such an idea was unwelcome to the prosperous and\r\nassimilated Jews, for the idea of assimilation had by now made some\r\nprogress even in English Jewry. The impression left on the minds of\r\nmany who heard of the idea was that there was a large number of Jews\r\ndesirous of forestalling the promised advent of the _Messiah_. They\r\nhad grown accustomed to the notion that Palestine was a thorny desert,\r\ninfested by hordes of marauding Bedouins, and only fit for beggars\r\nand pious pilgrims. They were ignorant of all that had been written to\r\nthe contrary by a number of authors, particularly by the indefatigable\r\nworkers of the Palestine Exploration Fund. They had learned to\r\ndiscredit the sacred promises as to the future of the country. They\r\nfelt themselves secure in the positions they had gained for themselves,\r\nand ridiculed the thought of renouncing them at the bidding of a few\r\nenthusiasts and dreamers, as if anyone had ever thought of placing\r\nsuch an alternative before them. They considered this idea _mauvais\r\nton_, and thought that it might endanger their newly acquired social\r\nposition, such as it was. These motives, and others like them, induced\r\nmost of the prominent Jews to turn away from a movement with which\r\nthey could have no sympathy.\r\n\r\n  Illustration:\r\n          ELIM H. _d’_AVIGDOR     _Col._ ALBERT E. W. GOLDSMID\r\n\r\n           JEAN HENRI DUNANT           _Father_ IGNATIUS\r\n\r\n         _Dr._ E. W. TSCHLENOW       _Dr._ MAX MANDELSTAMM\r\n\r\nNot so _d’_Avigdor. His intuitive mind showed him the futility of such\r\nfears and the possibility of attaining the grand results hoped for\r\nand partly achieved already by kindred societies, if only the efforts\r\nmade were kept within the bounds of prudence. He took up the cause of\r\nthe Jewish colonization of Palestine with ardour and energy. When he\r\nbegan work the “Lovers of _Zion_” Association did not yet exist, but\r\nnumerous meetings had already been held in support of the movement\r\nfor colonizing Palestine by Jews, though no steps had until then been\r\ntaken to give the agitation a practical turn. It was necessary first\r\nof all that a proper organization should be established, not only for\r\nthe purpose of utilizing the energies of the more practical promoters\r\nof the scheme, but also to prevent rash measures, which would have had\r\nthe effect of destroying the undertaking at its very birth.\r\n\r\nWith both these objects clearly in view, _d’_Avigdor urged the speedy\r\ncompletion of a constitution calculated to give the movement shape and\r\nsubstance, and to establish a system of work on defined and methodical\r\nlines. To this end he brought his organizing abilities into full play,\r\nand together with Colonel Goldsmid drafted a set of rules, which was\r\nmade the basis of future procedure. The services rendered by him to\r\nthe society were innumerable. He addressed public meetings in various\r\nparts of London, and travelled to the provinces for the purpose of\r\nrousing general interest in the work. He went to Paris and carried\r\non important negotiations for the acquisition of land in Palestine,\r\na task for which he was eminently fitted by reason of his wide\r\nexperience and great business ability. He secured 10,000 dunams of\r\nland in the Hauran on favourable terms. The departure of Colonel\r\nGoldsmid for the Argentine made his work more arduous. _d’_Avigdor\r\nwas then elected chief of the Association, while at the same time,\r\nas Commander of the Western Tent, he attended to the working of that\r\nparticular branch.\r\n\r\nA prominent feature in his activity was his chairmanship of the\r\nCentral Committee of the “Lovers of _Zion_” in Paris. The idea had\r\nseized hold of some branches of the Association on the Continent\r\nand in America, that valuable results might be achieved by united\r\nefforts in various countries. A meeting to consider proposals for the\r\nrealization of this idea was held in Paris, and some progress was made\r\nin the direction of co-ordination (Appendix lxxv).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XLII.\r\n\r\n                       THE MOVEMENT IN ENGLAND\r\n\r\n    William Ewart Gladstone――_Father_ Ignatius――Gladstone’s ideas\r\n    on Judaism――Concessions of the Jewish opposition――Goldsmid’s\r\n    and _d’_Avigdor’s nationalistic replies.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM EWART GLADSTONE (1809‒1898), the “Grand Old Man,” statesman,\r\norator, and scholar, gained the undying gratitude of humanity for his\r\nchampionship of right against might in countries which were striving\r\nfor freedom from the iron grip of tyrannical government. He stood\r\nfor liberty, liberty of race and creed. Wherever liberty had to\r\nbe championed he was always to the fore as one of its most valiant\r\ndefenders. It fell to him to help the cause of the English Jews rather\r\nthan that of the Jews of the world. Powerful as were his efforts in\r\nthe cause of national righteousness, he did nothing on behalf of the\r\nJews as a people. But we have it on the authority of _Father_ Ignatius\r\n(1837‒1908) that he was “a friend of the Zionist movement.”\r\n\r\n_Father_ Ignatius himself was for many years an enthusiastic supporter\r\nof the movement from the religious standpoint, but without any\r\nconversionist tendency. He defended the national idea of _Israel_ for\r\nmany years in numerous addresses, speeches and pamphlets. In one of\r\nhis lectures¹ he said:――\r\n\r\n    ¹ “The World’s Debt to the Jews,” 14 Oct., 1896.\r\n\r\n“... he was sorry to say that the magnificent truth respecting the\r\nChosen People has been set aside by certain Jews themselves. There\r\nwere some who were unconscious of the miracle of the preservation\r\nof the Jewish race, in spite of the efforts of the whole world\r\nto assimilate them――of the miracle of their distinct existence\r\nunassimilated with the other nations of the earth. Where was there a\r\nliterature produced by any nation that had had that moral civilising\r\nand enfranchising power over the hearts and minds and lives of men\r\nthat the literature of _Israel_ had exercised?...”\r\n\r\n“... It was necessary to incite the national idea and national\r\nambition in the heart of _Israel_ throughout the world. Why should an\r\nintelligent and powerful race be content to be vagrants on the face of\r\nthe earth? Why should they be content to be a homeless race now that\r\ncircumstances were pointing to facilities for giving them a home?...”\r\n\r\n“... The national movement was a reality and a fact. It is not a\r\nspasmodic movement, but one that was being carried on with great\r\npractical business-like skill and determination....”\r\n\r\n“... Let the world give the Jews their home. Palestine was the cradle\r\nof their race, its ancient and proper home, the centre of its great\r\nand glorious history, and it was the outpourings of sorrow for it\r\nthat has rendered the literature of the Jews the most precious and\r\nbeautiful one extant. The Jews had a right to Palestine, it was God’s\r\ngift to them, and that was a greater right than an Englishman’s right\r\nto England....”\r\n\r\n“Stir yourselves up, agitate, work, labour for your cause.

Much profit, says St. Paul, had the Jew\r\nin every way. He had the oracles of God: he had the custody of the\r\npromises: he was the steward of the great and fundamental conception\r\nof the unity of God, the sole and absolute condition under which the\r\nDivine idea could be upheld among men at its just elevation. No poetry,\r\nno philosophy, no art of Greece ever embraced, in its most soaring and\r\nwidest conceptions, that simple law of love towards God and towards\r\nour neighbour, on which ‘two commandments hang all the law and the\r\nprophets,’ and which supplied the moral basis of the new dispensation.”\r\n\r\n82. “There is one history, and that the most touching and most\r\nprofound of all, for which we should search in vain through all the\r\npages of the classics,――I mean the history of the human soul in its\r\nrelations with its Maker; the history of its sin, and grief, and death,\r\nand of the way of its recovery to hope and life and to enduring joy.\r\nFor the exercises of strength and skill, for the achievements and\r\nfor the enchantments of wit, of eloquence, of art, of genius, for\r\nthe imperial games of politics and of war let us seek them on the\r\nshores of Greece.... All the wonders of the Greek civilisation heaped\r\ntogether are less wonderful, than the single Book of Psalms.”\r\n\r\n83. “Palestine was weak and despised, always obscure, oftentimes and\r\nlong trodden down beneath the feet of imperious masters. On the other\r\nhand, Greece, for a thousand years, ... repelled every invader from\r\nher shores. Fostering her strength in the keen air of freedom, she\r\ndefied, and at length overthrew, the mightiest of empires; and when\r\nfinally she felt the resistless grasp of the masters of all the world,\r\nthen too, at the very moment of her subjugation, she herself subdued\r\nthem to her literature, language, arts, and manners. Palestine, in\r\na word, had no share in the glories of our race; while they blaze on\r\nevery page of the history of Greece with an overpowering splendour.\r\nGreece had valour, policy, renown, genius, wisdom, wit; she had all,\r\nin a word, that this world could give her; but the flowers of Paradise,\r\nwhich blossom at the best but thinly, blossomed in Palestine alone.”¹\r\n\r\n    ¹ Place of Ancient Greece in the Providential Order, 1865,\r\n      in Gleanings of Past Years 1860‒79.

Montagu, M.P. (afterwards Lord Swaythling), Mr. Elim H.\r\n_d’_Avigdor declared:――\r\n\r\n“... His objection to colonising America was that the farther west\r\nthey went, the greater the distance they placed between them and\r\n_Zion_. He wished rather that they should go to a country that was\r\nonce _Israel’s_ homestead, where brother might work with brother,\r\nwhere the _Sabbath_ would be the _Sabbath_ of all, and where _Yom\r\nKippur_ would be the day of abstention from food throughout the\r\ncountry. He was convinced that many wealthy co-religionists were\r\nwilling to surrender cheerfully all their worldly possessions, and\r\nresign all their hopes of worldly aggrandisement, in order to return\r\nwith their brethren to the land of their fathers. They express the\r\nhope every _Passover_, ‘Next year in _Jerusalem_.’ Was this utterance\r\nmerely a lip service, or did it spring from their hearts?...”\r\n\r\nLieut.-Col. Goldsmid followed, and said:――\r\n\r\n“... The seed of _Israel_ was meant for something more than a\r\ncommercial people. Let them not only strive to find a home for their\r\noutcast brethren, but let it be their aim and object to resuscitate\r\nthe national idea in _Israel_.”¹\r\n\r\n    ¹ No. 4 ...

June,\r\n      1893 (History of the _Chovevi Zion_ Rise of the Movement),\r\n      _pp._ 10‒13.\r\n\r\nIn an address delivered in Edinburgh he struck the same note:――\r\n\r\n“... there was no nation on the earth nearer akin to the Jewish\r\nnation than the Scottish, both in their love of the Bible and in their\r\nsympathy with all that is best in Judaism. The _Chovevi Zion_, he\r\nsaid, was not a charitable institution, the main object was to foster\r\nthe national idea in _Israel_. Had it not been for the national idea\r\nwe would have been wiped off the face of the earth long before now.¹\r\nColonel Goldsmid went on to show how we Jews, who are the descendants\r\nof the faithful minority in Babylon, continue to exist as heirs to the\r\npromises through all ages, while the descendants of the majority, who\r\nturned away from the national idea, no longer exist. Some people said\r\nthat members of the _Chovevi Zion_ could not be good citizens, but he\r\nmaintained that the true lover of _Zion_, who could be faithful after\r\ntwo thousand years, would die in defence of the _country_ he lived\r\nin.... When I visited Palestine in 1883, colonies were just beginning\r\nto be formed. People laughed at the idea of Jewish agriculturists.\r\nThere were three small colonies, but for want of implements to\r\nwork, things were at a standstill, some were actually tearing up the\r\nground with their fingers. Through the kindness of Baron Edmond _de_\r\nRothschild, matters are now very different.

Her works clearly\r\nreflect the progress of her ideas. She was a born songstress, yet she\r\ndid not sing like the nightingale for the joy of being alive. There\r\nwas a shadow of sadness resting on her entire being, something born\r\nwith her as part of her disposition and temperament, the stamp and\r\nheritage of a suffering race. _Hebraism_ lay dormant in this Jewish\r\npoetess. She was much influenced by Heinrich Heine (1797‒1856).\r\nCharmed by the beauty of his poetry, the whimsical play of his\r\nimagination and the heart’s muffled outburst audible through it all,\r\nshe was nevertheless unaware of the actual bond that united them: the\r\nrelationship in the blood, the unquenchable flame of the tragic Jewish\r\npassion of eighteen hundred years, which was smouldering in her own\r\nheart, and was soon to break forth and change the entire tendency of\r\nher thoughts and feelings.\r\n\r\nThe persecutions of the Jews in 1880‒1884 were for Emma Lazarus\r\na clarion call that awoke slumbering and unrealised feelings and\r\naspirations. She was an assimilated Jewess herself at the beginning\r\nof her literary career. She had been in search of heroic ideals in\r\nalien fields, in Pagan mythology and in mystic, mediæval Christianity,\r\nignoring all the time her birthright――the glorious vista of a great\r\npast and of a still greater future for the Jewish nation. Judaism had\r\nbeen a dead letter to her. But with the outbreak of the persecutions\r\nshe found herself again. From this time dated the mission which\r\nshe undertook on behalf of her race, and the expansion of all her\r\nfaculties, that growth of spiritual power which is always stimulated\r\nwhen a great cause is championed and strong convictions awaken the\r\nsoul. Emma Lazarus became an inspired poetess of the Jewish national\r\nidea. Her whole being had reshaped itself and found nourishment at an\r\ninexhaustible source. She threw herself into the study of her race,\r\nits language, its literature and history. Breaking the outward shell,\r\nshe soon reached the kernel of the faith and the “miracle” of its\r\nsurvival. What was it other than the ever-present, ever life-inspiring\r\nspirit itself, which cannot die――the religious and ethical zeal which\r\nfills the whole history of the Jewish people, and of which she herself\r\nfelt the living glow within her own soul? She had discovered the\r\nsecret and the genius of Judaism――that complete transfusion of spirit\r\nwith body and substance which, taken literally, often reduces itself\r\nto rites and ceremonies, but viewed in a proper light takes a nobler\r\nshape and form, and spreads its light over humanity in the prophets,\r\nteachers and saviours of mankind.\r\n\r\nThe idea that aroused the imagination of Emma Lazarus was a restored\r\nand independent nationality and the repatriation of the Jews in\r\nPalestine. In an article on the “Jewish Problem,” she wrote:――\r\n\r\n“I am fully persuaded that all suggested solutions other than this of\r\nthe Jewish problem are but temporary palliatives.¹\r\n\r\n    ¹ _Century_, February, 1883, _p._ 610.\r\n\r\n“The idea formulated by George Eliot has already sunk into the minds\r\nof many Jewish enthusiasts, and it germinates with miraculous rapidity.\r\n‘The idea that I am possessed with,’ says Mordecai, ‘is that of\r\nrestoring a political existence to my people, making them a nation\r\nagain, giving them a national centre, such as the English have, though\r\nthey, too, are scattered over the face of the globe. That is a task\r\nwhich presents itself to me as a duty.... I am resolved to devote my\r\nlife to it. At the least, I may awaken a movement in other minds such\r\nas has been awakened in my own.’” Could the noble poetess who wrote\r\nthese words have lived until to-day, she would have been astonished\r\nat the flame which her torch has kindled and the practical shape which\r\nthe movement brought to public notice by her has begun to assume.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1882, her first _Epistle to the Hebrews_ appeared as one\r\nof a series of articles written for the _American Hebrew_. Addressing\r\nherself to a Jewish audience, she unfolded her views and hopes\r\nfor Judaism without reserve, on the one hand passionately urging\r\nits claims and its high ideals, and on the other dispassionately\r\ndescribing the shortcomings and peculiarities of her race. She says:\r\n“Every student of the _Hebrew_ language is aware that we have in\r\nconjugation of our verbs a mode known as the _intensive voice_, which,\r\nby means of an almost imperceptible modification of vowel-points,\r\nintensifies the meaning of the primitive root. A similar significance\r\nseems to attach to the Jews themselves in connection with the\r\npeople among whom they dwell. They are the _intensive form_ of any\r\nnationality whose language and customs they adopt.... Influenced\r\nby the same causes, they represent the same results: but the deeper\r\nlights and shadows of the Oriental temperament throw their failings,\r\nas well as their virtues, into more prominent relief.”\r\n\r\nIn drawing the Epistles to a close,¹ she summarized the special\r\nobjects she had in view: “My chief aim has been to contribute my mite\r\ntowards arousing that spirit of Jewish enthusiasm which might manifest\r\nitself:――\r\n\r\n    ¹ February 24, 1883.\r\n\r\n“_First._ In a return to the world pursuits and broad asylum of\r\nphysical and intellectual education adopted by our ancestors:\r\n\r\n“_Second._ In a more fraternal and practical movement towards\r\nalleviating the sufferings of oppressed Jews in countries less\r\nfavoured than our own:\r\n\r\n“_Third._ In a closer and wider study of _Hebrew_ literature and\r\nhistory: and, finally, in a truer recognition of the large principles\r\nof religion, liberty and law upon which Judaism is founded, and which\r\nshould draw into harmonious unity Jews of every shade of opinion.”\r\n\r\nHer verses rang out as they had never sounded before, like\r\nclarion notes, calling a people to heroic action and unity, to the\r\nconsciousness and realization of a great destiny.\r\n\r\nWhat the annals of the “Lovers of _Zion_” in America tell us\r\nconcerning the rise and progress of the Zionist idea shows that the\r\nseed sown by Emma Lazarus took deep root in the hearts of the Jews,\r\nand brought forth abundant fruit. She created a high sense of Jewish\r\nself-consciousness, and spread a holy love and devotion to a great\r\nideal in the hearts of those who had not hitherto reflected on their\r\nnational duty and its importance.\r\n\r\nIn the _American Jewess_¹ an article appeared on the “Dream of\r\nNationality,” by Mrs. Rose Sonnenshein, the editress, one of the\r\nfew Jewesses who had as yet written a word on this question. She\r\nwrote: “To our mind there is no loftier ideal worth realization\r\nthan _Israel’s_ dream of Nationality.... What Jew has not dreamed of\r\n_Israel_ again as a nation? It can be confidently asserted that among\r\nthe sons and daughters of the Covenant it is an exceptional one who\r\nhas not at some time dwelt upon such a possibility. Who has not given\r\nthe loose rein to fancy and indulged in visions of _Judah_ re-born,\r\nfree, great and glorious, one of the Sister States in a modern\r\nfederation of nations? ... has not had visions of ourselves as\r\npatriotic Jews, proudly pointing to the Eagle of _Judah_, the emblem\r\nof a free and happy people? To the wandering son of _Israel_ the\r\nknowledge that a recognized government stood behind him to protect\r\nhim in his rights when he demands reparations of insult or injury and\r\nsustain him as the equal of citizens of other nations would endow him\r\nwith a dignity of which centuries of oppression have robbed him, and\r\nwhich not even the widest modern freedom has fully restored.”\r\n\r\n    ¹ April, 1897.\r\n\r\nThe question of the attitude of the Jews, particularly of “the\r\nleading and wealthy Jews,” towards Zionism arose at different times\r\nin the English Press. Amid much friendly criticism called forth by\r\nthe publication of Emma Lazarus’ writings, two plausible objections\r\nwere raised. The first was that before an appeal to the world, an\r\nappeal should be made to the Jews themselves, in order to elicit some\r\nevidence as to their feelings on the question. The second was that,\r\neven were the Jews to be restored, a difficulty would immediately\r\narise as to the means of subsistence or the kind of employment to be\r\nfound for them.\r\n\r\nIt was not an easy task to gain the sympathy and the support of many\r\n“leading and wealthy Jews” for the national idea in Western Europe\r\nand America. Many who were ready to admit the truth of the Zionist\r\nconclusion were troubled by their ideas about humanity. It must be\r\nborne in mind that only in the nineteenth century did the idea of\r\nnationality reappear in its ancient form, and that as late as the end\r\nof the eighteenth century it was considered a sign of advanced culture\r\nto have triumphed over national narrow-mindedness and to desire\r\nemancipation for the whole of humanity. The Middle Ages knew nothing\r\nof nationality in our sense, and therefore a sense of nationality\r\ncould not be expected of the Jews. But in the nineteenth century first\r\nhatred and then science began to recognize the nationality of the Jews.\r\nOn the one hand antagonists zealously put forth new arguments to prove\r\nthat the Jews were a distinct people, who had never yet been absorbed\r\nby their environment; on the other hand scientific research brought\r\nforward undeniable proofs of the physical, intellectual and moral\r\npeculiarities of the Jewish race. And just because separatism was\r\nemphasized and made use of by their enemies, some Jews considered\r\nthat for the purpose of self-defence it was best to deny it: or at\r\nany rate their unjustifiable timidity and unreasonable sensitiveness\r\nprevented them from admitting it. They forgot that for centuries the\r\nfurious storms of invective and calumny had been raging around their\r\npeople, and that there were no malignant suspicions, no treacherous\r\ninsinuations, no absurd accusations, that had not been levelled at\r\nthem, whether they admitted the fact of their distinctiveness or not.\r\nAnti-Semitism raged most against those Jews who showed particularly\r\nassimilative tendencies, and aroused against them every kind of hatred\r\nand rancour, regardless of the question whether they were faithful to\r\ntheir past and to their ideals, or otherwise.\r\n\r\nSome Jews imagined erroneously that the question at issue was one of\r\ntheir rights in different countries. They forgot that they must demand\r\nequality of rights as Jews, and not as a prize for giving up what they\r\ncould not give up――their history, their distinctiveness. Others, again,\r\nconfounded Jewish national self-consciousness with what the gentiles\r\nregard as nationalism――aspirations generally of an aggressive and\r\nreactionary character. Some wealthy Jews were unfortunately lulled\r\ninto a pernicious feeling of security or fatal indifference. What did\r\nthey give to the masses? A cheque for charity, whenever it was wanted,\r\nof course; but that was all. Insurance money or conscience money,\r\nwhichever it may be called, they gave; but of personal devotion,\r\nof serious anxiety or steady resolve to ameliorate the lot of\r\n_Israel_――nothing. They asked, how can a national ideal help poor\r\npeople? They did not understand that it can help them more than\r\nmoney: that it eases their sufferings, renders their sorrows and\r\ndisappointments less distressing, teaches them to search their own\r\nhearts, to consider their own ways.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that the “Lovers of _Zion_” in England and America had a\r\nhard fight. They knew that if they attempted to satisfy all sections\r\nof Jews they could not remain faithful to the nation, whose greatest\r\ninterest and immediate concern it is to pave the way for a final\r\nsolution of its problem. The truth had dawned upon them that for\r\nthousands of years there had always been a restless desire on the part\r\nof the Jews to get back to Palestine, and that this wish arose from\r\ndeep religious, traditional and national principles and hopes. It is a\r\nfeeling inherited by the Jew and fostered in him from the cradle. The\r\nancient home of the ancient nation is Palestine: to that land their\r\neyes, their hopes and their hearts are always turned. This attachment\r\ndoes not interfere with their sincere patriotism and loyalty to\r\nthe countries wherein they live. Those who live in other countries,\r\nand are satisfied, may remain there. The Jewish masses will go to\r\nPalestine as soon as they have the possibility of doing so. Palestine\r\nmust become the home of the nation, not merely of individuals. It\r\ndid not matter to the “Lovers of _Zion_” that some wealthy Jews did\r\nnot wish for the national re-birth; they simply emulated careful and\r\nprudent physicians, who, when they visit their patients, do not ask\r\nthem what they like best, and then prescribe what is most pleasing\r\nto their palates, though perhaps most hurtful, but, having carefully\r\nstudied the ailments of their patients, order them to take what\r\nthey deem most necessary for them, even though it be not pleasing or\r\nacceptable.\r\n\r\nIn 1897 Mr. Herbert Bentwich, LL.B., organized in London the\r\n“_Maccabean_” tour to Palestine, in which twenty-one persons took\r\npart. Under his guidance this party of Jewish travellers proceeded\r\nto Palestine, and got into close touch with the Jewish population of\r\nthe country, especially with the colonists. On _Sabbath Hachodesh_\r\n(3 April, 5657), the late Chief _Rabbi_, the Very Rev. Dr. Hermann\r\nAdler (1839‒1911), delivered an eloquent sermon¹ at the Hampstead\r\nsynagogue, in which he said:――\r\n\r\n    ¹ “God-speed to the Pilgrims.”\r\n\r\n“... But one of the most attractive portions of your tour will, I\r\nthink, be your visits to some of the colonies. And in this connection\r\nI may give an illustration of the vivid interest taken in your journey\r\nby the residents in the Holy Land. A well-informed correspondent\r\nwrites to the _Jüdische Presse_ expressing his regret that the only\r\nJewish colony you contemplate inspecting is _Rosh Pinah_, certainly\r\nthe most romantically situated, and that you will not see the\r\nprosperous settlement ‘_Rishon-le-Zion_,’ nor the agricultural school\r\n‘_Mikveh Israel_,’ and he advises a route which would enable you to\r\nsee a number of new settlements, and some thirteen Jewish villages\r\nthat have sprung up within the last ten years. Now undoubtedly\r\ngreat things have already been accomplished in training the hapless\r\nimmigrants from Russia and Roumania to become hardy tillers of the\r\nsoil ... well-trained Jewish horticulturists are at the head of each\r\nsettlement, that Jewish farmers, peasants and labourers toil with\r\nsplendid diligence ... 50, 000 eucalyptus trees planted in _Gadra_\r\nto counteract malarial influences; 2,000,000 of vines that have been\r\ngrafted by Jews in _Rishon-le-Zion_, _Petach Tikvah_ and _Zichron\r\nJacob_, and of the excellent wine that is produced there. In\r\n_Rishon-le-Zion_ there are numbers of smiths and coopers.... But yet\r\nI feel confident that this pilgrimage will exercise an abiding effect\r\non your spiritual life. It is a well-authenticated fact that _de_\r\nSaulcy [L. F. J. Cagnart] (1807‒1880), the great Oriental traveller,\r\nconfessed that he went to Palestine as an unbeliever, and that he\r\nreturned from there with a profound faith in the truth of the Bible.\r\nYou, I hope, do not need to have your faith thus strengthened. But\r\nI ardently trust that by this pilgrimage there will be engendered\r\nin your hearts ... a stronger sentiment of brotherhood, ... a more\r\nenthusiastic devotion to ... _Zion_ and _Jerusalem_,...”¹\r\n\r\n    ¹ _Jewish Chronicle_, 9th April, 1897, _p._ 21.\r\n\r\n  Illustration: 5657 * THE MACCABÆAN PILGRIMAGE * 1897\r\n\r\nThe visit of this party was a new feature in the Jewish history of\r\nPalestine. It was looked upon with satisfaction, as indicating the\r\ngrowing interest of English Jews in Palestine. It took place at the\r\nvery moment when modern Zionism entered upon the scene, on the eve of\r\nthe first Congress, and, so far as English Jews were concerned, it had\r\na good moral influence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XLIV.\r\n\r\n                          BARON _DE_ HIRSCH\r\n\r\n    His philanthropic activity――The Oriental Jews and the\r\n    “Alliance”――Emanuel Felix Veneziani――Lord Swaythling――Dr. A.\r\n    Asher――Laurence Oliphant.\r\n\r\n\r\nBARON MAURICE (Moritz) _de_ HIRSCH (_Freiherr auf Gereuth_) was born\r\non December 9th, 1831, at Munich. His father, Baron Joseph _de_ Hirsch\r\n(1805‒1895), was a native of that city, and son of Baron Jacob _de_\r\nHirsch (1764‒1841), the founder of the family fortune. His mother\r\n(_née_ Caroline Wertheimer of Frankfort) belonged to an old Jewish\r\nfamily which was universally known for its charitable work and sincere\r\npiety. Hirsch cherished very affectionate recollections of his parents,\r\nand particularly of his mother, who is said to have seen to it that he\r\nreceived good instruction in the Jewish religion.\r\n\r\nThe scope of his studies was somewhat narrow. He received his\r\neducation in Munich and Brussels. Being of a practical turn of\r\nmind, he engaged early in life in several business ventures. In 1855\r\nhe married Clara (1833‒1899), eldest daughter of Senator Raphael\r\nJonathan Bischoffsheim (1808‒1883), of the firm of Bischoffsheim and\r\nGoldschmidt, Brussels, which had branches in Paris and London. He\r\ndid not, however, join this firm, as its business methods appeared\r\nto him too conservative to suit his enterprising temperament. Having\r\ninherited a considerable fortune from his parents, and received a\r\nhandsome dowry with his wife, he embarked on railway enterprises\r\nin Austria, in Russia, and――with most success――in the Balkans.\r\nThese enterprises, which consisted mainly in the construction of\r\nlight railways, were only the beginning of his activities. A huge\r\nundertaking came in his way. A Brussels banking firm, which had\r\nreceived from the Ottoman Government a concession for building\r\na railway through the Balkans to Constantinople, was unable to\r\ncarry the project through. Hirsch acquired the concession, went\r\nto Constantinople, and succeeded in getting some of the conditions\r\naltered for the better. He then formed a company, and made all the\r\nnecessary arrangements for the building of this great railway, which\r\nwas, for the first time in history, to connect Europe with the Near\r\nEast. In certain financial circles his optimism was ridiculed. But\r\nthose who laugh last laugh loudest. It soon became apparent that\r\nhe knew what he was about when he secured the concession. By a bold\r\npractical stroke he obtained the necessary funds, and his success\r\nwas as immediate as it was complete. This was really the making of\r\nhis career. The success of this transaction gained him recognition\r\nas one of the greatest financiers of Europe. He became not only a\r\nmulti-millionaire, but also a recognized authority on large industrial\r\nundertakings.\r\n\r\nHis philanthropic activity, which began early in the seventies, was on\r\na scale hitherto unequalled, and showed great originality of method.\r\nThis activity may be divided into five branches:――\r\n\r\n    1. The East, in connection with the “Alliance Israélite\r\n       Universelle” of Paris.\r\n\r\n    2. Relief for the Russian Jews.\r\n\r\n    3. Emigration from Russia.\r\n\r\n    4. Foundation of the Jewish Colonization Association, and\r\n\r\n    5. Various other philanthropic institutions.\r\n\r\nWhile engaged in working out his plans for the construction of his\r\nrailway in Turkey, Hirsch had become acquainted with the deplorable\r\ncondition of the Jews in the Orient, and had come to the conclusion\r\nthat their sufferings were mainly due to the lack of modern education\r\nand of opportunities to earn a livelihood. He considered European\r\neducation a great necessity in the East, and therefore admired the\r\neducational work of the “Alliance Israélite.” It struck him that\r\ntoo little was done in this direction. He consequently placed large\r\nsums at the disposal of the “Alliance,” of which he became a powerful\r\nsupporter. In 1873 he gave the “Alliance” 1,000,000 francs to form\r\nnew schools, and from 1880 till his death he undertook to make good\r\nthe deficit of the organisation, which amounted annually to several\r\nhundred thousand francs. Finding that the ordinary schools were not\r\nsufficient for the purpose in view, he encouraged the “Alliance” to\r\nestablish trade schools, the entire expense of which he bore from 1878\r\nuntil his death. In 1899, in place of his annual grant, he gave the\r\n“Alliance” a capital sum, which yielded a yearly income of 400,000\r\nfrancs; but, none the less, he continued to meet the deficit year by\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nAll this time, as indeed throughout his life, he was keenly interested\r\nin the Jews of the Orient. He procured in the seventies the services\r\nof an excellent Jew, _M._ Emanuel Felix Veneziani (1825‒1889), who\r\nmade investigations for him, and became his almoner in the East, and\r\nafterwards also in other parts of the world.\r\n\r\nThe year 1882, with its pogroms and the atrocious Jewish\r\ndisabilities which it introduced, was a turning-point in Hirsch’s\r\nphilanthropic activities as much as in the activities of all the\r\nJewish organizations and of individual philanthropists. When 40‒50,000\r\npogrom refugees in a starving condition crowded into the already\r\ncrowded Galician Ghettoes, adding their starvation and agonies to\r\nthe misery already there, and the great Jewish organizations and\r\ncommunities sent their representatives to afford protection to the\r\nsuffering (Mr. Samuel Montagu――afterwards Lord Swaythling――and Dr.\r\nAsher Asher (1837‒1889) came from London, also Mr. Laurence Oliphant),\r\n_M._ Veneziani appeared as representative of Baron _de_ Hirsch, and\r\noffered enormous sums――by which, however, only a small part of the\r\nappalling distress was met. Baron _de_ Hirsch also sent money to\r\nRussia for years.\r\n\r\nAt that period Baron _de_ Hirsch, like most other emancipated Jews in\r\nWestern Europe, believed that a solution of the Jewish problem could\r\nbe achieved by steps taken in Russia itself. Like the others, he knew\r\nvery little of the great complexity and peculiar conditions of the\r\nproblem. So with the assistance of a Commission he devoted much of his\r\ntime to drawing up a scheme for the improvement of the condition of\r\nthe Jews in Russia. Bearing in mind the activity of the “Alliance” in\r\nthe East, he paid due regard to the need for providing Russian Jews\r\nwith modern education, and his scheme contemplated a fund of 50,000,\r\n000 francs to be used for educational purposes――under his own control.\r\nBut this was a Utopian idea. Anyone acquainted with the conditions\r\ncould easily have shown him that this offer would be declined.\r\n\r\nHe was finally and unalterably convinced that the only hope lay in\r\nemigration. With the adoption of this view began the third period of\r\nhis activity, in which he supported emigration in every shape and form.\r\nIt is difficult to estimate how much he spent for this purpose; but\r\nby far the greatest part of the support given by the “Alliance” and\r\nother organizations to emigration came from him. Later, however, he\r\nrealized that this support, useful as it was to individuals, was of no\r\npermanent value, and then, entering upon the fourth and most important\r\nperiod of his activity, he became the Baron _de_ Hirsch who will for\r\never be remembered in Jewish history――the man who endeavoured to solve\r\nthe Jewish problem not by charities, schools, contributions to the\r\n“Alliance” or schemes for the benefit of Russia, but by a single great\r\neffort for Jewish Emancipation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XLV.\r\n\r\n                AN ATTEMPT TO SOLVE THE JEWISH PROBLEM\r\n\r\n    The “Jewish Colonization Association” (1891)――Statutes and\r\n    shareholders――Baron _de_ Hirsch’s letter to the Russian Jews\r\n    ――His articles in the _Forum_ and the _North American Review_\r\n    ――Baroness Clara _de_ Hirsch.\r\n\r\n\r\nBARON _de_ HIRSCH was not a Zionist, nor do we desire to claim him as\r\na national Jew. Had he been asked whether he recognized the national\r\nidea, he would undoubtedly have replied that he was opposed to it.\r\nHe was not much interested in abstract ideas, and it is questionable\r\nwhether he could be made to fit in with any cut-and-dried theory\r\nat all. Nevertheless, his activities became those of a national Jew\r\nwhen once he was made fully conscious of the Jewish tragedy. Born in\r\nMunich, heir to an Austrian title, distinguished for his industrial\r\nundertakings in the East, resident in Paris, with powerful connections\r\nin England, he devoted himself at last almost entirely to his brethren\r\nin Russia. Was the impelling feeling a colourless cosmopolitan\r\nhumanism? One might have called it so as long as he merely supported\r\neducation and sent contributions to charities. But one cannot, without\r\ndoing violence to facts, regard the work of what we have called his\r\nfourth period――which was the very climax of his activity――as the mere\r\ncharitable routine which is characteristic of Jews whose purpose and\r\nhope is “assimilation.” Hirsch was more than a Jew of that type. The\r\ntendency towards assimilation destroys the Jew, discourages the man,\r\nkills his individuality, “and thus the native hue of resolution is\r\nsicklied o’er with the pale cast of thought,” and the Jew becomes an\r\nemulator of what other people do, a slave of other people’s opinions.\r\nIf a personality like that of Hirsch could develop in such an\r\nenvironment, it was because his inquiring mind, the experience gained\r\nin his travels and his absorption during youth of the old traditions\r\nof his people carried him far beyond his actual surroundings. It\r\nwas due to his individual gifts that he took up the great idea of\r\nconcentration of the persecuted Jewish people by means of colonization.\r\nHe directed all his energies to the investigation of the best places\r\nfor colonization, and the result was the formation of an international\r\nassociation, incorporated under English law, and known as the Jewish\r\nColonization Association, whose Memorandum of Association includes the\r\nfollowing clauses:――\r\n\r\n“To assist and promote the emigration of Jews from any part of Europe\r\nor Asia――and principally from countries in which they may for the\r\ntime being be subjected to any special taxes or political or other\r\ndisabilities――to any parts of the world, and to form and establish\r\ncolonies in various parts of North and South America and other\r\ncountries for agricultural, commercial and other purposes.\r\n\r\n“To purchase and acquire, by donation or otherwise, from any\r\nGovernments, States, municipal or local authorities, corporations,\r\nfirms, or persons any territories, lands, or other property, as\r\nconcessions, powers and privileges, which may be necessary or\r\nconvenient for developing the resources of the same and rendering\r\nthe same available for colonization.\r\n\r\n“To accept gifts, donations and bequests of money and other property,\r\non the terms of the same being applied for all or some one or more of\r\nthe purposes of the company, or such other terms as may be consistent\r\nwith the objects of the company.”\r\n\r\nThe Articles of Association provide, among other things, that no more\r\nthan half the capital is to be employed in the purchase of land, that\r\nthe governing body shall consist of a Council of Administration, who\r\nin their turn shall elect Directors, and these shall be paid officials\r\nand carry out all the executive work. The machinery provided by the\r\nArticles enables representative Jewish institutions to become members\r\nof the Company, and thereby to have a certain voice in the management.\r\nThe constitution further provides that under no circumstances shall\r\nany of the members derive any profit from the undertaking.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the objects of the Company, the last clause was\r\namplified at an Extraordinary General Meeting of the Company by the\r\naddition before “or on such terms” of the following words: “or for any\r\nother philanthropical purposes specified by the donor or testator for\r\nthe benefit of Jewish communities or individuals either in Europe or\r\nin America.”\r\n\r\nThe Jewish Colonization Association was founded with a capital of £2,\r\n000,000 divided into 20,000 non-dividend bearing shares of £100 each.\r\nBaron _de_ Hirsch subscribed for 19,993 shares; and Lord Rothschild\r\n(1840‒1915), Sir Julian Goldsmid (1838‒1896), Ernest (afterwards\r\nSir Ernest) Cassel, Frederic David Mocatta (1828‒1905), and Benjamin\r\nLouis (afterwards Sir Benjamin Louis) Cohen (1844‒1909) of London, and\r\nSalomon H. Goldschmidt (1814‒1898) and Solomon Reinach of Paris for\r\none share each.¹\r\n\r\n    ¹ Before his death Baron _de_ Hirsch divided his shares among\r\n      the following corporations: the Synagogues of Brussels and\r\n      the Jewish communities of Berlin and Frankfort-on-the-Main,\r\n      3600 each; the Anglo-Jewish Association of London and the\r\n      Alliance Israélite Universelle, Paris, 4595 shares each.\r\n\r\nAbout the time when the Jewish Colonization Association was formed,\r\nBaron _de_ Hirsch addressed an appeal to the Jews in Russia concerning\r\nthe emigration schemes which he intended to carry out under the\r\nauspices of the Company. The following is a translation of this\r\nappeal:――\r\n\r\n“To my co-religionists in Russia: You know that I am endeavouring to\r\nbetter your lot. It is, therefore, my duty to speak plainly to you,\r\nand to tell you what it is necessary for you to know.\r\n\r\n“I am acquainted with the reasons which oblige many of you to emigrate,\r\nand I will gladly do all in my power to assist you in your hour of\r\ndistress. But you must make this possible for me. Your emigration\r\nmust not resemble a rash and reckless flight by which the endeavour\r\nto escape danger ends in destruction. You know that properly organized\r\ncommittees are shortly to be established in Russia, with the consent\r\nand under the supervision of the Imperial Russian Government. The\r\nduty of these committees will be to organize the emigration in a\r\nbusiness-like way. All persons desirous of emigrating will have to\r\napply to the local committees, who alone will be authorized to give\r\nyou the necessary facilities. Only those persons who have been elected\r\nby the committees can have the advantage of the assistance of myself\r\nand of those who are working with me. Any one who leaves the country\r\nwithout the concurrence of the committees will do so at his own risk,\r\nand must not count on any aid from me.\r\n\r\n“It is obvious that in the beginning the number of emigrants cannot\r\nbe large; for not only must places of refuge be found for those who\r\nfirst depart, but the necessary preparations must be made for those\r\nwho follow. Later on the emigration will be able to assume larger\r\nproportions.\r\n\r\n“Remember that I can do nothing for you without the benevolent and\r\ngracious support of the Imperial Russian Government.\r\n\r\n“In conclusion, I appeal to you. You are the inheritors of your\r\nfathers, who for centuries have suffered so much. Bear this\r\ninheritance yet awhile with equal resignation. Have also further\r\npatience, and thus make it possible for those who are anxious to help\r\nyou to do so effectively.\r\n\r\n“I send you these words of warning and of encouragement in my own name\r\nand in the name of thousands of your co-religionists. Take them to\r\nheart and understand them.\r\n\r\n“May the good God help you and me, and also the many who work with us\r\nfor your benefit with so much devotion.”\r\n\r\nThis appeal, though it only urged the Jewish masses to assist the\r\ngreat work by obeying certain necessary prescribed regulations,\r\nhad the effect of rousing the entire Jewish population to a new\r\nhopefulness and of stimulating communal workers, leaders and\r\npublicists to further activity. There was not a poor Jewish home in\r\nRussia where the name of Hirsch did not receive a daily blessing――not\r\nfor what he had given or for what he was about to give, but because\r\nhe had stretched out a hand to them in their misery, because they no\r\nlonger felt themselves forsaken, and because a touch of kindness from\r\nan unseen hand gave them fresh courage, new resolution, and new hope.\r\n\r\nAs is usual in such cases, no warnings or denials could correct the\r\nestimate formed by the popular imagination of the possibilities of\r\nthe undertaking. Baron _de_ Hirsch himself was supposed to have said\r\nor written that he was going to transmigrate five million Jews from\r\nRussia in twenty years; and this statement, which was published in an\r\nofficial Russian paper, though in the unofficial part of it, gained\r\ncurrency at once, and remained in the minds of the people as a kind of\r\nprogramme. And, though the immediate excitement abated, and gave way\r\nto disappointment among those who had looked forward to a new gigantic\r\nexodus, it was evident that the chances of a partial solution of the\r\nJewish problem were immensely greater than they had ever been before.\r\n\r\nBaron _de_ Hirsch caused careful inquiries and investigations to\r\nbe made in countries which offered suitable land for agricultural\r\ndevelopment. It may be observed that, though the wording of the\r\nstatutes contemplates commercial colonies and the encouragement of\r\nartisans, and speaks of “any parts of the world,” in reality Hirsch\r\nhad never thought of commercial colonies nor of artisans nor of small\r\ngroups scattered all over the world, since first he started dealing\r\nwith the Jewish problem in Russia. Commercial colonies for Jews\r\nare as unnecessary as they are impossible, because Jews engaged in\r\ncommerce need not and would not congregate in colonies; and as to the\r\nindustrial education and encouragement of artisans, it is true that\r\nHirsch was interested in useful work of this kind, but this was at\r\nan earlier period, and belongs to the kind of philanthropic activity\r\nwhich he carried on, particularly in the East, through the “Alliance,”\r\n_etc._ As to Russia, anybody who had any conversation with him, or\r\nread his articles¹ on the subject, or was in touch with his advisers\r\nat that period, will testify that what Hirsch had decided to initiate\r\nwas a great undertaking for the persecuted Jewish people. Since he\r\nhad received, much to his surprise, the reply that he would not be\r\nallowed to work in Russia, he had systematically declined to undertake\r\nanything there except the support of emigration. Petitions poured into\r\nhis office at Paris, rue d’Elysée 2, from innumerable Jewish societies\r\nand communities in Russia, but he refused to pay any attention to all\r\nthese schemes for the encouragement of artisans and industries. He was\r\ndevoted to the idea of concentrating masses of Russian Jews elsewhere,\r\nand of making them agriculturists. Since 1887 he had practically\r\ndecided to make the Jewish people the principal heirs of his fortune,\r\nin order to enable them radically to change their status.\r\n\r\n    ¹ _North American Review_, July, 1891: _Forum_, August, 1891.\r\n\r\nPersonal experiences of a sentimental nature had contributed to this\r\ndecision. The terrible and unexpected blow, in losing his only son\r\nLucien (1851‒1887), a young man of exceptional gifts and promise,\r\ntouched his most tender affections and gave a fresh impetus to his\r\ndesire to succour human misery. It was feared for a moment that he\r\nwould be overwhelmed by the weight of a catastrophe which had ruined\r\nso many hopes. But he possessed such energy, such powerful resources\r\nof character, that he soon recovered. His very natural grief found\r\nsanctification in the noble diversion of devoting himself more eagerly\r\nthan before to his immense task. His wife, a keenly idealistic Jewess,\r\nexerted a strong Jewish influence upon him, encouraging to the utmost\r\nthe great work which he started. The unfortunate mother, after having\r\nlost her only child, found comfort in the idea of “establishing a home\r\nfor the oppressed Jewish people.”\r\n\r\nAnother personal experience which had some influence on Hirsch was\r\nthe anti-Semitic attitude of the Jockey Club of Paris towards him,\r\nan attitude that made him realize the futility of dreams of unity.\r\nThere is no need, however, to lay particular stress on these personal\r\nexperiences. Apart from them, he could not fail to notice the workings\r\nof anti-Semitism, not only in its violent and brutal forms, but also\r\nin its subtler manifestations; and this brought home to his mind the\r\nnecessity of a solution which should prove more practical than the old\r\nmethods.\r\n\r\nBut the thing that did most to bring him nearer to Zionism than to\r\nassimilation, in spite of his dissent from Zionist views, was his\r\nbelief in the Jewish people. He was a believer in the regeneration of\r\nthe Russian Jews through agriculture, from which occupation they were\r\nbarred in the country in which they lived. What, unfortunately, was\r\nlacking in him was the sense of historic tradition and the love of\r\nPalestine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XLVI.\r\n\r\n                   THE ARGENTINE _VERSUS_ PALESTINE\r\n\r\n    Expeditions and investigations in various countries――The\r\n    decision in favour of The Argentine――Dr. G. Löwenthal――Col.\r\n    A. E. W. Goldsmid――The “Lovers of _Zion_” and Baron _de_\r\n    Hirsch in 1891――Baron and Baroness _de_ Hirsch’s charitable\r\n    works.\r\n\r\n\r\nBARON _de_ HIRSCH sent agents to make investigations in various\r\nparts of America――in Brazil, Mexico, Canada and The Argentine. On the\r\nadvice of Dr. Guillaume Löwenthal, who was mainly entrusted with these\r\ninquiries, he arrived at the conclusion that The Argentine presented\r\nconditions most favourable for a plan of colonization. Large tracts\r\nof land were consequently purchased in the districts of Buenos Ayres,\r\nSanta Fé and Entre Rios. The Russian Government, which had rejected\r\nhis offer for the amelioration of the condition of the Jews in the\r\nEmpire, co-operated with him in the organization of a system of\r\nemigration. A central committee, selected by the Baron, and various\r\nprovincial committees were formed in St. Petersburg, Warsaw, Odessa,\r\nKiew and other centres. He formed also a governing body in The\r\nArgentine; and――for a short time――the personal direction of the\r\ncolonies was entrusted to Colonel A. E. W. Goldsmid, who obtained\r\ntemporary leave of absence from the British War Office for this purpose.\r\nBaron _de_ Hirsch, who did not always find the most prudent, devoted\r\nand trustworthy agents, had in Colonel Goldsmid, the ardent Zionist, an\r\ninspired and enthusiastic coadjutor; but Goldsmid remained there only a\r\nshort time.\r\n\r\nThe gigantic plan of colonization met with the measure of failure\r\nand of success to be expected by such enterprises. The work was\r\nenormous, and, as far as finance and responsibility were concerned,\r\nit fell almost entirely upon Hirsch’s shoulders. Hirsch created all\r\nthe necessary machinery, and sent out agent after agent to furnish\r\nhim with a correct account of the facts. He sent Mr. Arnold White\r\nto Russia four times to negotiate with the Russian Government. A\r\nnumber of influential Russian Jews, including Baron Horace Günzburg\r\n(1833‒1909), a well-known philanthropist and a recognized leader of\r\nRussian Jewry, as well as Poliakoff, Warschawsky, and others, devoted\r\ntheir energies to the organization in Russia. David Feinberg, a\r\ngenerous and devoted Russian Jew, who had considerable experience in\r\nJewish communal affairs in the Russian capital, and had given many\r\nyears’ service in connection with Baron Günzburg’s public activities,\r\nwas appointed general secretary.\r\n\r\nAt first the conditions in The Argentine were somewhat chaotic;\r\nafterwards matters proceeded in an apparently satisfactory manner.\r\nAppearances, however, were deceptive. Not that success was wanting:\r\nfar from it. Colonies were established; the Baron convinced himself\r\nthat Russian Jews could really become successful agriculturists.\r\nBut the task of transporting great masses there proved to be an\r\nimpossibility. Undoubtedly a few thousand families were helped, and\r\nthe colonies, some of which are in a flourishing condition, are a\r\ncredit to Jewish agriculture. But this was not the original object.\r\nThese colonies had really been intended to form the nucleus of one\r\ngreat home, if not for millions, at least for hundreds of thousands\r\nof Jews. This could not be achieved without popular enthusiasm. The\r\nJew could not be expected to love the soil of “The Argentine” as he\r\nloves the soil of the Promised Land. He went there, as he would go\r\nto Brazil, or to Mexico, to improve his material condition, but the\r\nmoment other possibilities were offered to him, he would give up his\r\ntrying occupation and go elsewhere. From the national point of view,\r\nif he had to become an Argentinian Spaniard of the Jewish persuasion,\r\nhe might as easily, and perhaps more easily, become an American. If\r\nhe had to build up a centre for Judaism, he could not look forward to\r\nany success there, being so far removed from his traditional centres.\r\nMoreover, Zionism is an ideal which to a certain extent regenerates\r\neven the Jew of the Diaspora, who does not go to Palestine himself,\r\nbecause of its national aspect, its historic associations, its\r\ninfluence on education. All this was lacking in The Argentine\r\nundertaking. It was, therefore, bound to remain a matter of economic\r\nimprovement, if not of ordinary charity.\r\n\r\nIn 1891 the “Lovers of _Zion_” tried to persuade Hirsch to turn his\r\nactivities to Palestine. Herzl tried again in 1896, unfortunately\r\nwithout success. The fact that Hirsch had met with a repulse at the\r\ntime of his earlier transactions with the _Sultan_, Abdul Hamid,\r\nmay have made the difficulty of obtaining a charter from the Ottoman\r\nGovernment seem a greater obstacle to him than it would have seemed to\r\nothers. In his negotiations with the “Lovers of _Zion_” in 1891 he was\r\nnot altogether an opponent; he wavered for a while between different\r\ncountries, considering exclusively the quality of the soil, the\r\nprice, facilities and so on; but he overlooked the essential fact. The\r\nquestion for him was not one of history and national desire, but of\r\nthe soil, the income, and, above all, the extension of his scheme. The\r\nable and ingenious business man wanted to be practical. The builder\r\nof a great railway wanted to establish a colony for millions, and\r\nhe believed in the lustre of his gem. Had he known that in “The\r\nArgentine,” in spite of its apparently unlimited possibilities,\r\nonly some ten thousand Jews would settle, he would undoubtedly have\r\npreferred Palestine, where even ten thousand, as true representatives\r\nof a nation in its old country, have a far greater value. But he felt\r\nhimself called upon to accomplish great things in the economic sphere.\r\nIt was the very instinct of the man, his nature, the bent of his\r\ngenius. If we wish to understand him, we must make full allowance\r\nfor his surroundings, his education and the times in which he lived.\r\nHis idea was a long step towards Zionism, but some would not have\r\nit for that particular reason. It is significant that his enormous\r\nmunificence remained quite isolated; he had no followers, though he\r\nwas very anxious to find some. Could anybody imagine a National Fund\r\nfor Jewish agriculture in “The Argentine”? The masses, it is true,\r\nwere interested in his scheme, but their interest was one of curiosity,\r\nof the wish to be helped, not of self-help. And not only the masses,\r\nbut the wealthy people too held aloof. A short time before he died,\r\nhe received a few hundred pounds from two or three people for his\r\nundertaking, and he felt very happy!\r\n\r\nDuring his negotiations with the “Lovers of _Zion_” he revealed\r\nhis idea of creating a Jewish Commonwealth,¹ saying that he was\r\nendeavouring to prepare the conditions for such a scheme. On another\r\noccasion, discussing the difficulties of administration, _etc._, he\r\nexclaimed:――\r\n\r\n    ¹ He used the term “_Gemeinwesen_.”\r\n\r\n    “_Give me Jewish apostles, and I shall succeed!_\r\n\r\nIt dawned upon him that something was missing.\r\n\r\nThe fifth period of his activity comprises various philanthropic works.\r\nThe large number of Russian Jews who emigrated to the United States\r\nattracted his benevolent interest; and in 1891 he was instrumental\r\nin organizing under the laws of the state of New York the Baron\r\n_de_ Hirsch Fund, with a capital of 2,500,000 dollars, which sum\r\nwas afterwards increased. The national Jewish character of Hirsch’s\r\nactivity lies here again in the fact that he identified himself with\r\nhis suffering brethren all over the world.\r\n\r\nMany men of his immense wealth and distinguished position would no\r\ndoubt have used such advantages chiefly, if not exclusively, for the\r\npromotion of causes that fill a large place in the popular estimation.\r\nThe cause of the Russian Jews would have been too remote, too\r\nintricate, or too small to engage all their sympathies and efforts.\r\nHe made it his life-work to undertake something big on behalf of the\r\nRussian Jews. His benevolence was not that weak sentimentalism which\r\ntoo often obscures the plain behests of duty. He liked society, but he\r\nnever stooped to win a cheap popularity by an unbecoming complaisance.\r\nThere have been Jews enjoying the same high station, who have put\r\nit to quite a different use. But to him wealth and social power were\r\nsimply one continuous challenge――a challenge to his nobler self, to\r\nhis reverence for duty. And never could his higher self stand forth\r\nmore conspicuously than when it impelled him to think and to work\r\nfor his disinherited people. His leading idea was not to combat the\r\npersecutors of the Jews, but to emancipate the Jews themselves――to\r\nextricate them from their mediæval life, to revitalize them with\r\nthe breath of “Western culture,” to give them a wider range\r\nof occupations, to transform the pedlar into an artisan and the\r\nshopkeeper into an agriculturist, in short, to render their political\r\nemancipation a necessity by convincing their oppressors of their sound\r\neconomic worth. It was a repetition of the programme of the “Alliance\r\nIsraélite Universelle” and the Anglo-Jewish Association (Appendix\r\nlxxvi), but it had the merit of being in the hands of a man who knew\r\nnothing of the difficulty of collecting resources from an inert public.\r\n\r\nAs he lived the greater part of his life in Austria, it is quite\r\nnatural that the deplorable condition of the Jews in that empire\r\nappealed strongly to him. In 1889, after consultation with Dr. Adolf\r\nJellinek (1821‒1893) of Vienna, he formulated a plan to aid the\r\nJews of Galicia by educational work, support for handicraftsmen\r\nand agriculturists, loans to artisans, _etc._ In 1891 the Austrian\r\nGovernment agreed to the plan, and Baron _de_ Hirsch thereupon placed\r\n12,000, 000 francs at the disposal of the trustees.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing are only a few of the foundations established by Baron\r\n_de_ Hirsch. In addition may be mentioned the Canadian Baron _de_\r\nHirsch Fund, and the large sum given to the London hospitals, to\r\nwhich he also devoted the entire proceeds of his winnings on the turf.\r\nHe always said that his horses ran for charity. It is impossible to\r\nform an accurate estimate of the amount of money that he devoted to\r\nbenevolent purposes. Including the large legacy of about 250,000,000\r\nfrancs left to the Jewish Colonization Association, it exceeded 800,\r\n000,000 francs, is an estimate justified by the amounts given by him\r\nfrom time to time to the foundations already referred to. He died in\r\n1896, having built for himself a monument more lasting than one of\r\nbrass or marble:――\r\n\r\n    _The Jewish Colonization Association._\r\n\r\nThe Baroness died in 1899. The amount devoted by her to benevolent\r\npurposes exceeded fifteen million dollars,¹ and she further endowed\r\nher various foundations by leaving them ten million dollars in her\r\nwill.\r\n\r\n    ¹ Baron _de_ Hirsch Trade School in New York City; Clara _de_\r\n      Hirsch Home for Working Girls in New York; Fund for the\r\n      Officials of the Oriental Railways, _etc._\r\n\r\nThe present possessors of the shares of the Jewish Colonization\r\nAssociation are: The Alliance Israélite Universelle, the Anglo-Jewish\r\nAssociation, and the Jewish Communities of Brussels, Berlin and\r\nFrankfort-on-the-Main.

Since 1900 the Association has been entrusted by Baron Edmond\r\n_de_ Rothschild with the care of his Palestine colonization schemes,\r\nand it is to be hoped that this great Jewish institution will turn its\r\nattention more and more to work in Palestine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Illustration: _THE CONGRESS PORTRAIT_\r\n                                          _Leopold Pilichowski_\r\n                      בנימן ואב בן יעקב\r\n                   (_THEODOR HERZL_)\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XLVII.\r\n\r\n                            MODERN ZIONISM\r\n\r\n    Theodor Herzl――The first conception and the acceptance of\r\n    Palestine――Max Nordau――The ideas of Modern Zionism.\r\n\r\n\r\nZIONISM, an idea as old as the Jewish nation, preached by the\r\nrepresentatives of Jewish thought, accepted and supported by prominent\r\nChristians in England and France and elsewhere, expressed and carried\r\ninto effect in the colonization work in Palestine, was still in need\r\nof a great leader. There had been many eminent champions, thinkers and\r\nenthusiasts, but no great leader. Theodor Herzl (1860‒1904) then came\r\nupon the scene――a born leader of men.\r\n\r\nThere had been no one before him with his indomitable energy, his\r\nmagnificent determination and his inspired restlessness. He had at his\r\ncommand all the intellectual pleasures which the combination of Vienna\r\nand Paris could offer. He was welcome in society and in literary\r\nand artistic circles. His outlook on life before Zionism dawned upon\r\nhim had been that of the usual type of the modern, denationalized,\r\nassimilated Jew. But the old spirit of the Jewish nation awoke in him\r\nand removed him from this world of illusions. At the height of his\r\nliterary popularity in the gay Austrian capital, in the prime of youth\r\nand success, he put aside everything else to champion the cause of his\r\npeople. He created the politics of a state unborn. He began his Jewish\r\ncareer with almost the whole of official Jewry in Western Europe\r\nopposed to him and intent on silencing him, until he succeeded in\r\noutshining his adversaries. Then the public conscience awakened,\r\nthe force of truth prevailed, and he found adherents. He imparted to\r\nthe Jews the greatest national impulse that they have had since the\r\n_Galuth_ began.\r\n\r\nHe found the word which crystallized all the yearnings and hopes\r\nof centuries. He spoke the truth, although four hundred and fifty\r\npriests¹ of assimilation clamoured for falsehood. He brought freedom\r\nto the Jewish soul and kindled Jewish enthusiasm to a flame. He\r\nreminded the Jews that they were still unalterably attached to the old\r\ncentre of Jewish national life, that Zionism remained the ultimate aim\r\nof their aspirations, and that the old prophecies were still a living\r\nforce. He devoted all his determination and skill to his people, and\r\nhis endurance and ability to the work of organizing the masses. It was\r\nthe influence of his personality over men that made him a great leader.\r\nHis nobility of character shone forth in his actions, found expression\r\nin his speech, and flashed in his eyes.\r\n\r\n    ¹ Then said Elijah unto the people: “I,” even I only, am left\r\n      a prophet of the Lord; but Baal’s prophets are four hundred\r\n      and fifty men. 1 Kings xviii. 22.\r\n\r\nThe simplicity and modesty of the truly great man showed themselves in\r\nall that Herzl conceived and achieved. He was a man of vast knowledge,\r\nof irresistible logic, a brilliant writer and a great artist; but in\r\nJewish affairs he was a _homo novus_. He was almost ignorant of Jewish\r\nlearning, of Jewish literature, even of Zionism before his time.\r\nDuring a discussion on Jewish culture at one of the Zionist Congresses,\r\nhe frankly admitted that he did not know exactly what “Jewish\r\nculture” meant. But he was the embodiment of the old Jewish genius,\r\na re-incarnation of those times when there were Jewish heroes, kings\r\nand statesmen. It was hardly necessary for him to plead for the ideal\r\nof “Jewish culture,” because his personality supplied the argument\r\nrequired. His high-minded disinterestedness, his unselfish devotion,\r\nhis unceasing self-sacrifice, his magnificent energy, his wonderful\r\ngift of seizing opportunities for the furtherance of his great ideal,\r\nhis high sense of duty, his sincere kindness and modesty of heart,\r\nmarked him out to be the first Zionist leader in the Diaspora.\r\n\r\nThe depth, tenderness and sincerity of the love he bore his nation,\r\nhis passionate yearning for the achievement of the great object before\r\nhim――these found expression in every word he uttered and every action\r\nhe undertook. These noble sentiments, together with the magnetism of\r\nhis personality, accounted for his tremendous influence over so large\r\na section of modern Jewry. He sacrificed his whole being and all his\r\npossessions in furtherance of the ideal which he faithfully upheld,\r\nsatisfied with the prospect of bringing his people gradually nearer\r\nthe sacred goal of their wanderings.\r\n\r\n  Illustration:                               _Elliott and Fry_\r\n                   _Dr._ MAX SIMON NORDAU\r\n\r\nDr. Max Simon Nordau, a son of _Rabbi_ Gabriel Südfeld of Krotoschin,\r\nalready at that time a writer of international reputation, was one of\r\nthe first to respond when Herzl started the Zionist movement; and he\r\nwas practically second to Herzl in building up the organization. These\r\ntwo men came to be looked upon as the natural leaders and the foremost\r\nrepresentatives of the new Zionism. Nordau was Herzl’s faithful\r\nfriend and assistant from the commencement. He placed his genius, his\r\nenthusiasm and his powerful eloquence at the service of the Zionist\r\nidea and organization. His authority and influence in the propaganda\r\nof Zionism became the most powerful and influential force in the\r\nmovement. Nothing could surpass the overwhelming logic and the\r\nadmirable spirit of his speeches, pamphlets, essays and articles. From\r\nthe very beginning he played the part of a great leader with splendid\r\nconfidence, inspiration, and dignity. No Zionist has exercised a\r\nstronger or a loftier influence by sheer strength of character and\r\nsound judgment. No orator or writer in modern times has so forcibly\r\nportrayed the great tragedy of his people as he has done in his\r\nmemorable speeches at the Zionist Congresses, and none has voiced so\r\neloquently the claims and hopes of his nation. He had always a message\r\nto deliver, and delivered it always effectively. He helped to make\r\nZionism a world-wide movement, with an appeal not only to the Jewish\r\npeople but also to other nations. His forcible eloquence and untiring\r\nzeal in the service of Zionism are generally known. Nor does his\r\npublic activity exhaust his services to the cause. He gave much useful\r\nadvice to Herzl, who never undertook anything of importance in Zionist\r\npolitics without consulting him. Nordau exercised enormous influence\r\nduring the whole period of Herzl’s and Wolffsohn’s presidency, and\r\nis still doing so at the present moment. A man of great literary\r\nand journalistic achievement, with extensive associations and wide\r\ninterests, a champion of all great causes of humanity and justice,\r\nzealously engaged in various domains of human thought, he has always\r\nplaced his time, his pen, and his matchless eloquence at the service\r\nof Zionism.\r\n\r\nHerzl fathomed the causes of the sufferings of his people, and saw a\r\nradical solution of the Jewish problem of two thousand years in the\r\nnational regeneration of the Jew. Like his great predecessor Pinsker,\r\nhe thought at first that it was immaterial where the proposed Jewish\r\ncentre was situated. He had then no opportunity of knowing the real\r\nfeeling of the Jewish people on this point. When he tested that\r\nfeeling he quickly discovered that Palestine was the only possible\r\ncountry. Wishing to see a Jewish centre established, and knowing that\r\nelsewhere it was impossible, because contrary to history and tradition,\r\nhe concentrated his efforts on Palestine, and although he realized the\r\ndifficulties more than anyone else, he remained till the day of his\r\ndeath (notwithstanding the East African scheme, which he considered\r\nonly from the point of view of preparation for Palestine) a convinced\r\nand ardent Palestinian.\r\n\r\nTo repopulate this ancient country, to make it a centre of human\r\ncivilization, was his object. He did not think that the solution of\r\nthe problem lay in emigration _per se_. He saw that, however carefully\r\nemigration was carried out, the result in the long run must be a mere\r\nshifting from place to place. Colonization on a large scale, in any\r\nterritory that might be found for the purpose, taking no account of\r\nthe historic national sentiment of the Jewish people, and lacking the\r\nattractiveness necessary to make it more than a philanthropic scheme,\r\ncannot solve the problem. And philanthropy will not solve the Jewish\r\nquestion. Zionism alone――the Jewish National Movement――seeks to\r\ngrapple with the Jewish question effectually once and for all. It\r\nproposes to establish for the Jewish people a secure and recognized\r\nnational home in Palestine――the land to which the Jew during two\r\nthousand years of exile has never relinquished his moral claim.\r\n\r\nWhile providing a refuge for oppressed Jews from other lands, a home\r\nin Palestine would become a centre for the Jews throughout the world,\r\nthereby raising their status everywhere, and saving them from the\r\ndegradation to which they are now constantly subjected, merely because\r\nthey are Jews. Such a plan has a spiritual appeal, and rallies to\r\nits aid such energy, enthusiasm and driving power as no scheme of\r\ncolonization in any other country would ever command. And in spite\r\nof the contention of the different philanthropic Jewish societies\r\nthat the immediate needs of the Jewish masses are best satisfied by\r\nimproving their condition in the countries in which they live and by\r\noffering them opportunities of emigrating to other countries, it was\r\nfelt in all quarters where intense Jewish feeling was still alive that\r\nthe new vision of Herzl must not be allowed to fade away.\r\n\r\nThis new Zionism differs widely from all Jewish philanthropic\r\nefforts. It was based not on charity, but on an appreciation of\r\nhistory――political, economic, social and ethical. It proposed the\r\nrebuilding of a nation and the repopulating of a country. It meant\r\na logical and morally satisfactory solution of the general Jewish\r\nproblem. It was not a measure for the moment, but an achievement\r\nfor the benefit of untold generations. It did not profit merely the\r\npoverty-stricken or persecuted section of our people, but affected\r\nthe whole of Jewry by a complete change in its position. It taught\r\nagain the old lesson that no Jew, conscious of his duty towards the\r\nunborn generations of his people, should ever lose sight of the fact\r\nthat Palestine, and Palestine alone, is the country to which he has a\r\nhistoric claim for all time, that in the old country of his ancestors,\r\nand there alone, it is possible to work out his people’s destiny, and\r\nthat nothing short of this ideal can be accepted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER XLVIII.\r\n\r\n                      THE FIRST ZIONIST CONGRESS\r\n\r\n    The general impression――The proclamation of the Jewish\r\n    national idea――The Basle Programme――The first Executive\r\n    Central Committee――Prof. ♦Hermann Schapira――Christian visitors\r\n    at the first Congress――Letters of the Grand _Rabbin_ of\r\n    France, _M._ Zadoc Kahn, and of the _Haham_ of the Spanish\r\n    and Portuguese Jewish community of London, Dr. Moses Gaster.\r\n\r\n    ♦ “Herman” replaced with “Hermann”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE first Zionist Congress met in Basle on August 29th, 1897.\r\n\r\nThis gathering will one day be surrounded by a halo of mythical\r\nsignificance and glory. There were about 200 delegates from almost\r\nevery country in the world at this Jewish national assembly, the\r\nfirst convened since the Exile by the Jewish people themselves. The\r\nenthusiasm was beyond description. For the first time in the Diaspora\r\nthe Jewish people felt strong and free. Divided by exile, it was again\r\nunited by national ties as well as by those of a history of common\r\nsuffering and common hopes. The convener of the Congress received\r\nendless ovations. All those present realized the historic event in\r\nwhich they were taking part. The Congress solemnly proclaimed to the\r\nlistening world that the Jews are a nation. It pictured accurately the\r\nJewish situation.\r\n\r\nThis picture was black. It was terrible, but it was true. Regarding\r\nit to-day, we must confess it to be prophetic. And it was not unfolded\r\nfor the purpose of lamentation or protest, but with the object of\r\nimpelling to strenuous action and self-help. The Congress formulated\r\nits intentions in the following programme, which was carried\r\nunanimously with the greatest enthusiasm:\r\n\r\nThe aim of Zionism is to create for the Jewish people a home in\r\nPalestine secured by public law. The Congress contemplates the\r\nfollowing means to the attainment of this end:――\r\n\r\n1. The promotion, on suitable lines, of the colonization of Palestine\r\nby Jewish agricultural and industrial workers.\r\n\r\n2. The organization and binding together of the whole of Jewry by\r\nmeans of appropriate institutions, local and international, in\r\naccordance with the laws of each country.\r\n\r\n3. The strengthening and fostering of Jewish national sentiment and\r\nconsciousness.\r\n\r\n4. Preparatory steps towards obtaining Government consent, where\r\nnecessary, to the attainment of the aim of Zionism.\r\n\r\n  Illustration:\r\n            _Dr._ LOUIS LOEWE           _Rabbi_ _Dr._ N.

Samuel Pineles first, second and third\r\nVice-Presidents respectively. The Executive Central Committee elected\r\nby the First Congress consisted of:――\r\n\r\n_Vienna_: Dr. Theodor Herzl, Dr. Schnirer, Dr. Oser Kokesch, Dr. Müntz,\r\nJulius M. Kremenezky. _Austria_ (other than Galicia): Dr. Sigmund\r\nKornfield. _Galicia_: Dr. Salz, Dr. Korkis. _Bukovina_: Dr. Meyer\r\nEbner. _France_: M. Bernard Lazare. _Germany_: _Rabbi_ Dr. Isaac J.\r\nRülf, Dr. Bodenheimer. _Russia_: _Rabbi_ Samuel Mohilewer, Prof. Max\r\nMandelstamm, Dr. Jacob Kohan-Bernstein, Isidor Jasinowski. _Roumania_:\r\nDr. Karl Lippe, Samuel Pineles. _Bulgaria and Servia_: Prof. Gregor\r\nBelkovsky. _Orient_: Jacques Behar.\r\n\r\nOne of the most prominent members of the First Congress was Dr.\r\nHermann Schapira (1840‒1898), Professor of Mathematics at the\r\nUniversity of Heidelberg. He was a native of Russia, and had a most\r\nremarkable career. Being too poor to study, he turned to trade, and\r\nwhen he had saved sufficient money became a student once more. He was\r\nthen already forty years of age, but his keen intellect and industry\r\nsoon brought him to the forefront in mathematics, which he had studied\r\nprivately without the help of a school or a teacher. He first learned\r\nhis science from old _Hebrew_ books, and then from books written\r\nin other languages. So much was his pre-eminence recognized that,\r\nnotwithstanding his being a Jew and a foreigner――a Russian subject――he\r\nwas appointed to the Professorship of Mathematics at Heidelberg\r\nUniversity. He remained in appearance, in manners and in mentality as\r\ntypical and picturesque a member of his people as any old _Rabbi_. He\r\nwas an excellent _Hebrew_ scholar, and well versed not only in ancient\r\nJewish history and literature, but also in modern _Hebrew_ literature.\r\nLike the whole modern _Hebraist_ school, he regarded _Hebrew_ as\r\na living tongue. His heart and soul were in the “Lovers of _Zion_”\r\nmovement and in the _Hebrew_ revival. At the first Zionist Congress he\r\nsolemnly called upon the delegates to declare allegiance to the cause.\r\nWhen differences of opinion arose, the old Professor in impassioned\r\nlanguage appealed to all to sink their differences and personal\r\nprejudices and to work unitedly with one heart and soul for the common\r\ncause. A dramatic scene followed. The Professor called upon every\r\ndelegate present to raise his right hand, and they all did so and\r\nrepeated after him:――\r\n\r\n                  “אם־אשכחך ירושלם תשכח ימיני׃”‎¹\r\n\r\n    ¹ “If I forget thee, O Jerusalem,\r\n       Let my right hand forget her cunning”\r\n                              (Psalm cxxxvii. 5).\r\n\r\nThis was one of the most solemn moments of the Congress. On the other\r\nhand, when Professor Schapira first spoke about the necessity of\r\na Jewish National Fund, an idea which he had advocated some time\r\nearlier in _Hebrew_ articles, the proposal was regarded as a chimera\r\nrather than as a practical scheme. But he did not feel discouraged\r\nby the opposition of the “practical people.” During the first year\r\nof the Zionist organization, between the first and second Congresses,\r\nhe devoted himself entirely to Zionist work. He died on a Zionist\r\npropaganda tour, during a stay at Cologne.\r\n\r\nThe first Christian clergyman to encourage Herzl was the Chaplain to\r\nthe British Embassy in Vienna, the Rev. Dr. W. H. Hechler, who is an\r\nardent student of the Bible and a Christian “Lover of _Zion_.” With\r\nthe full knowledge of his chief, the British Ambassador, he supported\r\nthe Zionist movement, and introduced Herzl to several of his Royal and\r\nImperial pupils and friends. He was the first English clergyman to go\r\nto Russia and help the persecuted Jews on the spot: he visited at that\r\ntime Odessa, Mohilew, Kishinew and Balta. He visited the Holy Land\r\nseveral times, and regularly attended the Zionist Congresses.\r\n\r\nAmong the most interesting visitors at the Congress were, the famous\r\npioneer of Zionism, Henri Dunant; and the Protestant pastor Dr.\r\nJohannes Lepsius, son of Carl Richard Lepsius (1810‒1884), the famous\r\nEgyptologist, who is thoroughly acquainted with the East, and had\r\nbeen pastor of a small community in the Harz Mountains. Dr. Lepsius\r\nwarmly espoused the cause of the Armenians in 1895, and when, as the\r\nresult of his agitation, the German Government sent him a warning,\r\nhe resigned his post. He placed his views on the Zionist Congress\r\nbefore a meeting held on the 7th September, 1897, at Basle, in a paper\r\nentitled, “Armenians and Jews in Exile; or, the Future of the East\r\nwith Reference to the Armenian Question and the Zionist Movement.”\r\nAfter referring to points of similarity between Jews and Armenians,\r\nboth persecuted races, he said: “When the time comes ... will Jewry\r\nlay their hands on Palestine and say: this is our land? Will anyone be\r\nable to prevent them? Even if the Zionist movement has an exclusively\r\nnational character, there is yet a strong religious undercurrent.\r\nWe believe that the Jewish nation has a future before it, and that\r\nthis future will be a glorious one.” The address was followed by\r\nan interesting discussion, in the course of which Professor Carl\r\nFriedrich Heman, the Orientalist, of Basle University, heartily\r\nendorsed Dr. Lepsius’ views.\r\n\r\nThe greatest achievement of the new Zionism was the Jewish\r\nCongress――the supreme authority in the movement based upon democratic\r\nprinciples――and the creation of a world-wide organization for the\r\nresuscitation of the Jewish nationality and for the regaining of\r\nPalestine, not by brute force or political adventure, and not by any\r\nact against the government or the population of the country or any\r\nother government or nation, but by force of conviction, enthusiasm,\r\ndevotion and self-sacrifice.\r\n\r\n_M._ Zadoc Kahn (1839‒1905), Grand _Rabbin_ of France, addressed a\r\nletter of congratulation to the first Zionist Congress. The Grand\r\n_Rabbin_ wrote that he would not fail to follow with much interest\r\nthe deliberations of the Congress. Whatever might be thought as to the\r\nutility and opportuneness of the Congress, it could not be denied that\r\nit merited every attention. Differences of opinion were inevitable,\r\nbut he prayed with all his might that God might guide and inspire all\r\nthe leaders of the movement, and that the debates and the resolutions\r\nwhich would be arrived at would be for the benefit of Judaism\r\nthroughout the world.\r\n\r\nIn an interview on the subject of the Zionist movement, which took\r\nplace immediately after the first Zionist Congress, _M._ Zadoc Kahn\r\nspoke in the highest terms of Dr. Herzl.\r\n\r\n“This man of faith is also a man of action. He is an apostle, but\r\nan apostle who is doctor of political economy. I know he occupies a\r\ndistinguished place in the Austrian Press, and that he has excellent\r\nrelations in the highest political spheres. But he appears ready to\r\nsacrifice all for the triumph of his ideas.” _M._ Zadoc Kahn then\r\ncriticized in very mild terms the exaggerated “pessimism” of Herzl’s\r\npamphlet, “The Jewish State,” and after dwelling on the religious\r\naspects of the question, he concluded:――\r\n\r\n“The sympathy of the French Jews, now awakened, is assured to the\r\nZionists. To ridicule or condemn a project when this project carries\r\nwith it hope, and thus consolation, to thousands of co-religionists\r\nwho are molested in their quality as Jews, this the French Jews have\r\nnot the right to do.”\r\n\r\nIn opening the proceedings of the final day of the Congress, Herzl\r\nannounced that several letters and telegrams had been received. The\r\nonly one he would mention was that sent by the Rev. Dr. Moses Gaster,\r\n_Haham_ of the Spanish and Portuguese Jews in England, who wrote to\r\nexpress his sympathy with the objects of the Congress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XLIX.\r\n\r\n                     THE MOTIVE FORCES OF ZIONISM\r\n\r\n    Modern _Hebrew_ literature――The _Chovevé Zion_――The pioneers\r\n    in Palestine.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHUS the Zionist Movement was launched. Before we follow its progress\r\nduring the intervening twenty years, it will be as well to give some\r\naccount of the forces at work in Jewish life which made the movement\r\nand its success possible. For Zionism cannot be properly understood if\r\nit is regarded merely as a result of certain political combinations or\r\nas a reaction against anti-Semitism. It must be traced to its roots,\r\nwhich lie deep in the national consciousness of the Jewish people; and\r\nthat national consciousness is not simply a vague sentiment, but has\r\nlong had its concrete expressions in connection with the revival of\r\nPalestine and of the _Hebrew_ language. The inner history of Zionism,\r\nthen, is to be traced along the lines of Palestinian colonization\r\nand the _Hebrew_ renascence. For convenience we may divide our brief\r\nsurvey into three main headings:\r\n\r\n    1. Modern _Hebrew_ Literature.\r\n\r\n    2. The _Chovevé Zion_ and University Zionist Groups in various\r\n       countries.\r\n\r\n    3. The pioneers of the _Hebrew_ Revival in Palestine.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered, however, that these are not watertight\r\ndivisions, and we naturally meet with the same men in different fields\r\nof work.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the present chapter is to trace the development of each\r\nof these three forces (so far as that has not been done in earlier\r\nchapters), giving some account of the outstanding figures in each\r\ndepartment. There is in each field a host of less distinguished but\r\nnot less devoted workers. Of some of these mention is made in Appendix\r\nlxxv.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    1. _Modern Hebrew Literature_\r\n\r\nFrom a linguistic and literary point of view, no less than from a\r\nmoral and religious standpoint, the Bible is a great and wonderful\r\nbook:\r\n\r\n                        ¹‏בן בג בג אומר הפך בה והפך בה דכלא בה\r\n                    פּרקי אבות. ה׳ כה.‏\r\n\r\n    ¹ Ben Bag Bag said, ponder in it, and ponder in it, for all is\r\n      in it. _Ethics of the Fathers_, v., 25.\r\n\r\nNot that modern _Hebrew_ writers use the Bible merely as a storehouse\r\nof words and phrases, depending on reminiscence for their effect.\r\nThe practice of cramming _Hebrew_ writings with scriptural quotations\r\nso as to give them an artificial brilliance and a second-hand wealth\r\nof idiom and grandeur of diction was characteristic of the so-called\r\n_M’lizah_.¹ In our time there is no more of this patchwork writing.\r\nThe _Hebrew_ language has become independent of quotations, but none\r\nthe less the traditional spirit continues to live, and the Bible\r\nis the corner-stone of modern _Hebrew_ literature. It could not be\r\notherwise, for in the Jewish view the Bible must enter into every\r\nphase of man’s life, must exert an influence upon the words of his\r\nmouth, the thoughts of his mind, and the feelings of his heart.\r\nThis is the result not of any dogma, but of the tradition of Jewish\r\nlearning, which is a sort of intellectual devotion, a reverent feeling,\r\na particular worship of the _Torah_ as knowledge, teaching, thought.\r\n\r\n    ¹ _M’lizah_ = “flower of speech.”\r\n\r\nThe revival of the _Hebrew_ language was thus able to become the\r\nforemost factor in the Jewish national revival. Yet little attention\r\nhas been paid to this part of the history of Zionism. Perhaps the most\r\nimportant reason is the general ignorance of the _Hebrew_ language or\r\nof its modern literature and Press. Some writers on Zionism are quite\r\nignorant of the whole of this literature, others are misinformed as to\r\nits past, and often imperfectly and insufficiently conversant with its\r\npresent, and are only capable of repeating mechanically a few names\r\nand titles which have gained currency. Few have an adequate conception\r\nof the real activity of hundreds of writers, of the amount of work\r\nwhich has been done, or of the succession of the different stages\r\nof development. This lack of knowledge is the main reason for the\r\nstrange opinion so often expressed by anti-Zionists in Western\r\nEurope, particularly in England, that Zionism is a mere political or\r\nmaterialistic movement.\r\n\r\nOur object here is not to write a history of _Hebrew_ literature\r\nas such, but only to illustrate a part of Zionist history which has\r\nhitherto been very imperfectly surveyed, and a certain knowledge of\r\nwhich is necessary for a real and adequate conception of the inner\r\nintellectual forces which have made Zionism what it is. The fact of\r\nimportance from our point of view is that the best, the noblest, and\r\nthe soundest ideas were brought into Zionism from _Hebrew_ literature,\r\nthat certain _Hebrew_ writers are prominent nationalists, that from\r\nthem have gone forth “the thoughts that inspire” and “the words\r\nthat ignite,” and that the wide dissemination of the Zionist idea\r\namong hundreds of thousands of Jews (Russian Jews or those who came\r\nfrom Russia) could not have been produced merely by organization\r\nand business institutions, had they not been prepared for it by\r\nthe knowledge and every-day use of the _Hebrew_ language with its\r\ninnumerable national, historical and Palestinian reminiscences\r\nand associations. And not only that: in our view even the better\r\nelements of the _Hebrew_ literature of the period which preceded the\r\nZionist movement, and which is commonly known as the “_Haskalah_”\r\n(enlightenment) period, as well as the writings of those modern\r\nauthors who do not support Zionism, have contributed to that great\r\nregeneration which has enabled the national language and literature\r\nto reach such an advanced stage of development.\r\n\r\nFor the beginnings of modern _Hebrew_ literature we must go back at\r\nleast as far as Abraham Dob Bär (1789‒1878) _ben_ Chayyim Lebensohn\r\n(surnamed Michailishker; _pseudonym_ Adam), the Hebrew Klopstock――a\r\nserious and somewhat dry poet and his son Micah Joseph (1818‒1852),\r\na graceful singer cut off in his early bloom. Contemporary with them\r\nwas F. Rothstein, an almost unknown Polish _Chassid_ and _Maskil_,¹\r\nwho translated _Hermann and Dorothea_ of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe\r\n(1749‒1832) in stanzas of laconic beauty which in precision of outline\r\nand completeness of impression are as sublime as the original. These\r\nmen founded a school of poets, the tradition of which was carried\r\non by men like Solomon _ben_ Baruch Salkind (1805?‒1868); Bernhard\r\nNathansohn (_b._ 1832); David Moses Mitzkun (1836‒1887); and Isaachar\r\nBerush Hurwitz (_b._ 1835). Contemporaneously, the beginnings of a\r\nmodern prose literature were being created. To Mordecai Aaron _ben_\r\nJudah Asher Günzburg (1795‒1846) we owe a _Hebrew_ style at once\r\nforceful and condensed, in great contrast to the limp and diffuse\r\nstyle prevalent before him. Abraham Mapu (1808‒1867), master of a\r\npure biblical style and a wonderful imaginative sympathy with the life\r\nof Bible times, created in his romantic novel _The Love of Zion_ a\r\ngossamer web in evanescent hues of gold and silver. Kalman Schulman\r\n(1819‒1899), a versatile translator and popularizer, did much to\r\nbreak ground for the ideas of the _Haskalah_. Isaac Erter (1792‒1851),\r\nof Galicia, wrote satires which are masterpieces of art in their\r\nepigrammatic beauty. These and a host of lesser men laid the\r\nsubstantial foundations on which later a more specifically nationalist\r\n_Hebrew_ literature could be built up. For themselves they were too\r\nbusy with their task of acclimatizing European culture on _Hebrew_\r\nsoil to trouble overmuch about nationalism. Their tendency was\r\neven towards assimilation, so strong was their reaction against the\r\nconservatism of their environment. This tendency is seen most strongly\r\nin the greatest of these _Maskilim_, Judah Löb (Leon) _ben_ Asher\r\nGordon (1831‒1892), a poet, essayist and story-teller, who united\r\nlightness of touch, clearness and elegance of diction with a great\r\ngift of expression, and combined in one harmonious whole accurate\r\nreflection and vivid imagination――an exceedingly keen satirist, and\r\nthe most profound among writers of the _Haskalah_ in the knowledge\r\nand use as well of the biblical as of the post-biblical _Hebrew_\r\nidiom. The recently deceased veteran novelist Solomon (Shalom) Jacob\r\nAbramowitsch (1836‒1918) “_Mendele Mocher Sephorim_”² still continued\r\nto carry on the _Haskalah_ tradition; and although dubbed “Grandfather\r\nof _Yiddish_,” he also produced _Hebrew_ works of immortal value,\r\nthe works of a giant artist in language and imagination. But broadly\r\nspeaking the ideals of the _Haskalah_ have given place since about\r\n1880 to a more distinctly nationalist tendency.\r\n\r\n    ¹ _Chassid_――member of the sect of _Chassidim_ or\r\n      “Pious.” _Maskil_――upholder of the ideals of _Haskalah_\r\n      (“enlightenment”), as against strict traditionalism\r\n      with its restriction of intellectual interest to ancient\r\n      _Hebrew_ literature.\r\n\r\n    ² The Jewish Cervantes.\r\n\r\nThe historical and philosophical bases of modern Jewish nationalism\r\nwere laid in the earlier half of the nineteenth century by a number of\r\nJewish scholars who wrote in _Hebrew_, and of whom the most noteworthy\r\nare Nachman Cohen Krochmal (1785‒1840), Samuel David _ben_ Hezekiah\r\nLuzzatto (1800‒1865) and Solomon Judah Löb Rapaport (1790‒1867).\r\nKrochmal in his _Modern Guide for the Perplexed_ (a title which\r\nalludes, of course, to the great work of Maimonides), strove to effect\r\na synthesis ♦between traditional Judaism and Hegelianism. The national\r\nidea is a postulate of his method, and he presents it in a rational\r\nand constructive manner, entirely free from sentimentality. Luzzatto,\r\nwho studied deeply and wrote much in the fields of history, religious\r\nideas and exegesis, was more of a mystic in temperament, but not\r\nless fundamentally nationalist in outlook. Rapaport, an encyclopædic\r\nscholar and one of the pioneers of the so-called “Jewish Science”\r\n(scientific study of Judaism and Jewish history), was perhaps less\r\ndirectly and consciously concerned with the national idea, but\r\nhis hostile attitude to the extravagances of the “Reform” movement\r\nsufficiently indicates his leaning. Another profound scholar who has\r\nreceived too scant attention is Jacob Reifmann (1818‒1895), whose\r\n_Hebrew_ pamphlet _The Mission of Israel_――one of a hundred treatises\r\nand articles――is an eloquent exposition of the national idea and a\r\nthoroughgoing condemnation of radical “Reform,” not from a theological,\r\nbut from a purely nationalist and historical point of view. We may\r\nremark in passing that some of the later representatives of “Jewish\r\nScience,” though they wrote mostly in other languages than _Hebrew_\r\n(principally German), were essentially nationalist in feeling:\r\nespecially Heinrich Hirsch Graetz (1817‒1891), the historian, who\r\nwas influenced by Moses (Moritz) Hess (1812‒1875), and really――though\r\nperhaps unconsciously――laid the foundations of Jewish nationalism in\r\nWestern Europe, and David Kaufmann (1852‒1899), whose learning and\r\ninstinct combined made him welcome Zionism and defend its leaders on\r\noccasion. Important, however, as was the work of these scholars in\r\ngiving Jewish nationalism the necessary philosophical foundation,\r\nthe spread of the national idea among the people is more directly\r\ndue to the popular _Hebrew_ writers of Russia, who, growing up during\r\nthe _Haskalah_ period, abandoned the vague, universalistic idea of\r\n“enlightenment” for the conception of a modernized and progressive\r\nJewish people.\r\n\r\n    ♦ “beween” replaced with “between”\r\n\r\nOf these David _ben_ Dob Baer Gordon (1826‒1886) was one of the\r\nearliest. In 1856 he became assistant editor of the first _Hebrew_\r\nweekly paper, _Ha’magid_. He also assisted in the formation and\r\nconduct of the Society _Mekize Nirdamim_ (1864), established for the\r\npurpose of publishing old and valuable _Hebrew_ works. In 1884 he went\r\nto London as the representative of the _Chovevé Zion_ to congratulate\r\nSir Moses Montefiore on the hundredth anniversary of his birth.\r\n\r\nPeter (Perez) _ben_ Moses Smolenskin (1842‒1885), the most popular\r\n_Hebrew_ writer of his time, was an ardent nationalist and Zionist\r\nduring the second period of his literary activity. He rejected the\r\ntheory associated with the name of Mendelssohn, which makes Judaism\r\nnothing more than a religious confession; and against this theory\r\nhe wrote a series of articles and essays. About 1880 he began to\r\nbe interested in the colonization of Palestine. He joined Laurence\r\nOliphant, through whom he hoped to secure the intervention of European\r\nPowers in favour of the Jews. His realistic Hebrew novels, as well as\r\nhis monthly _Ha’shachar_ (The Dawn), exercised a wide influence.\r\n\r\nMoses Löb Lilienblum (1843‒1910) was a progressive “radical” during\r\nthe first half of his literary career. But the anti-Jewish riots of\r\n1880 and 1881 aroused him to a consciousness of the unsafe position\r\nof the Jews in exile, and he started writing articles in _Hebrew_ and\r\nin Russian, in which he pointed to the re-establishment of the Jews\r\nin Palestine as the only solution of the Jewish question. He wrote\r\nseveral pamphlets, and as Secretary of the _Chovevé Zion_ took a most\r\nearnest and energetic part in their activity.\r\n\r\nAlexander Ossypovitch Zederbaum of St. Petersburg (1816‒1892)\r\nindefatigably advocated the colonization of Palestine by Jews in his\r\n_Hebrew_ paper _Ha’melitz_. He did not confine his labours in the cause\r\nof Jewish nationalism to such editorial efforts. He took an active part\r\nin obtaining the permission of the Russian Government for the formation\r\nof an Association of _Chovevé Zion_ in Russia, with its centre in\r\nOdessa, and afterwards in organizing the Association.\r\n\r\nSamuel Joseph Fuenn (1819‒1891) of Wilna was an admirable scholar and\r\na _Hebrew_ writer of wide outlook. For many years he was editor of the\r\n_Hebrew_ weekly _Ha’carmel_. His _Kiria Neemana_ (the History of the\r\nJews in Wilna) is a standard work. He was also author of _Ha’otzar_\r\n(_Hebrew_ dictionary), of a biographical lexicon, and of many other\r\nbooks of reference. During the last years of his life he was engaged\r\nin the _Chovevé Zion_ movement.\r\n\r\nJechiel Mendelssohn (1817‒1892) of Lublin, was a distinguished\r\n_Hebraist_. The diversity as well as the extent of his reading was\r\nremarkable. He knew the whole of _Hebrew_ literature as well as the\r\nclassical writers of antiquity, and had a wide knowledge of Jewish\r\nhistory. His _Hebrew_ style was of great exactitude and beauty. He\r\ncontributed to _Hàboker Or_, _Ha’melitz_ and _Ha’assif_, and preached\r\nwith artistic skill and historical discrimination the national idea of\r\nthe _Chovevé Zion_.\r\n\r\nAsher Ginzberg――“_Achad Ha’am_”――deserves a special chapter in the\r\nhistory of Zionism. He was the most prominent literary figure in the\r\n_Chovevé Zion_ movement, and he is the most respected and influential\r\nrepresentative of modern _Hebrew_ literature. Born in Russia, and\r\neducated in the traditional religious way, he went through a carefully\r\narranged course of studies in “Jewish Science” and in philosophy and\r\nliterature. He first attracted notice by his articles in _Ha’melitz_\r\nabout the condition of the colonies in Palestine. He had the clearness\r\nof mind to see things as they were, and the courage to publish what he\r\nbelieved to be the truth. The absence of exaggeration, the earnestness,\r\nand the steadfast truth-seeking which are the characteristic features\r\nof all his writings, and give them peculiar weight, were already\r\nclearly developed and evident in his first essays. He founded the\r\n_Hebrew_ monthly _Ha’shiloach_, which became a creative force in the\r\nmodern _Hebrew_ revival. He grouped around himself young men of talent,\r\nand discovered, stimulated and guided many young writers and students,\r\nwho looked upon him as their spiritual father. _Ha’shiloach_ soon\r\nbecame the leading literary _Hebrew_ review, principally owing to\r\nhis philosophical and publicistic articles. A deep and clear thinker,\r\nhe expounded with convincing logic, and in calm, noble and dignified\r\nlanguage the ideology of Jewish nationalism. His principal ideal is\r\nJewish national distinctiveness in the Diaspora, based upon _Hebrew_\r\nculture, and making Palestine a spiritual centre or “nidus.” Some of\r\nhis essays can be read in an English version by Leon Simon of London,\r\npublished by the Jewish Publication Society of America. We should,\r\nhowever, form a very inadequate estimate of the services which this\r\ndistinguished writer has rendered to Zionism, and of the influence\r\nwhich he has exerted on his readers, were we to confine our attention\r\nsolely to his writings. It is the combination of a writer and a\r\npersonality that gives him his unique position. He was successfully\r\nactive in the _Chovevé Zion_ movement, he has visited Palestine\r\nseveral times, and he founded in 1889 the Order “_B’nai Moshé_,”\r\na group of intellectual Jewish Nationalists. This Order, which\r\nexisted for eight years, gave rise to the foundation of the _Hebrew_\r\nPublication Society “_Achiasaf_” in Warsaw, of the first modern\r\n_Hebrew_ school in _Jaffa_, and of the Palestinian colony _Rechoboth_.\r\nOut of these grew many other institutions for colonization, _Hebrew_\r\nliterature and education.\r\n\r\nChaim Nachman Bialik is the greatest living _Hebrew_ poet, and with\r\nhis name the national revival is inseparably connected. Born in\r\nVolhynia, Russia, he had a _Talmudical_ education. He started his\r\nliterary career in the _Ha’shiloach_ and other _Hebrew_ reviews. He\r\nrose quickly to great fame, making a new era in _Hebrew_ poetry. He\r\nhas an epic as well as a lyric gift. His marvellous artistic instinct,\r\nhis harmonious _Hebrew_, his liveliness of imagination, the melody\r\nof his verse place him in the highest rank. He is a national poet in\r\nthe noblest sense of the term. He voices the feelings and traditions\r\nof generations. He has measured the groans of our people, has counted\r\ntheir sighs and tears, has gathered and sung them and played them\r\nupon the celestial harp of his _Hebrew_ muse. Sometimes, like a rebel\r\n_cherub_, he sounds the trumpet of judgment against tyranny. He is\r\nfamiliar with every phase of Jewish thought and life, ancient as well\r\nas modern, in the _Ghetto_ as well as in nature, but his heart is in\r\n_Zion_, and here the freshness and vividness of his colouring, the\r\ntruth and life-like reality of his pictures, the enthusiasm of his\r\nhopes are unsurpassed. He is also distinguished as a writer of prose,\r\nand is active in the _Hebrew_ Publication Society “_Moriah_,” at\r\nOdessa, which has enriched _Hebrew_ literature by many valuable works.\r\n\r\nSaul Tschernichowsky, born in Michailovka, Russia, by profession a\r\nphysician, is, next to Bialik, the greatest living _Hebrew_ poet.\r\nHe is distinguished by depth and tenderness of feeling, fertile and\r\ningenious fancy, profound knowledge of the classical world, the easy\r\ntransition by which he passes from nature to man, exquisite sense of\r\nbeauty and a highly developed taste for music, which makes his verse\r\nexceedingly melodious.\r\n\r\n\r\n         2. _The Chovevé Zion and University Zionist Groups_\r\n\r\nWe have more than once had occasion to mention the groups of\r\n_Chovevé Zion_ (“Lovers of _Zion_”) which sprang up in Russia in the\r\nearly eighties for the support of the pioneers of immigration into\r\nPalestine. Some account of the most important of these groups and\r\nof the outstanding personalities connected with them will indicate\r\nboth the rapidity with which the movement spread, and the continuity\r\nof development between the _Chovevé Zion_ and the new Zionist\r\norganization founded by Herzl. We shall find throughout that those who\r\ncame into prominence in Herzl’s movement were almost without exception\r\nmen who had been active for years before as “Lovers of _Zion_.”\r\nWe shall find also that everywhere it was the Jewish University\r\nStudent――and particularly the Russian Jewish Student, whether at a\r\nRussian or at a German or Swiss University――who, captured by the idea\r\nof the national revival, became the life and the driving force of the\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\nThe first place among the _Chovevé Zion_ groups belongs to that of\r\nOdessa, which became and has remained the headquarters of the whole\r\norganization. We have already mentioned three prominent members\r\nof this group――Pinsker, _Achad Ha’am_ and Lilienblum (the last two\r\nin connection with their services to _Hebrew_ literature). Among\r\na host of other Odessa Zionists who have earned distinction, _M._\r\nM. Ussishkin stands out most prominently because of the influence\r\nwhich his energy and determination have won for him. He graduated\r\nin engineering at Moscow, where he was instrumental in founding the\r\n_B’nai Zion_ (“Sons of _Zion_”)――one of the earliest and strongest of\r\nthe _Chovevé Zion_ groups. Afterwards he went to Ekaterinoslaw, and\r\nonly later to Odessa, where he has been the centre of Jewish national\r\nwork in all its branches for some years. To him perhaps more than\r\nto any single man is due the return of Zionist effort to practical\r\ncolonizing work in Palestine after the temporary concentration on\r\npolitical negotiation under Herzl. He has worked strenuously for\r\nthe financial institutions of Zionism as well as for Palestinian\r\ncolonization and the _Hebrew_ revival.\r\n\r\nOf the brilliant group of leaders which received its training in the\r\n_B’nai Zion_ of Moscow we mention here the recently deceased Dr. Ephim\r\nWladimirovitch [Jechiel] Tschlenow (1865‒1918), Vice-President of the\r\nInner Actions Committee of the Zionist Movement. After graduating in\r\nmedicine at Moscow University, he settled in that city, and divided\r\nhis life between the claims of his profession and those of Zionist\r\nwork. He combined appreciation of the value of practical work in\r\nPalestine with a sound sense of political values. He had been twice\r\nto the Holy Land, and in a brochure, _Five Years’ Work in Palestine_\r\n(written in Russian and translated into German), produced an admirably\r\nclear and comprehensive record of recent Jewish achievements in the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nScarcely less important than the Odessa and the Moscow Societies were\r\nthose of St. Petersburg, of Bialystok, of Pinsk, of Minsk and of Wilna,\r\nevery one of which was a training-ground for men who afterwards became\r\nprominent in the Zionist movement. It was at Pinsk, his birthplace,\r\nthat Dr. Chaim Weizmann, now President of the English Zionist\r\nFederation, began his Zionist activity, which was continued afterwards\r\nwith such fruitful results at German and Swiss Universities and in\r\nthis country. Wilna is the home of two Zionists, the brothers Isaac\r\nand Boris Goldberg, who hold a specially distinguished place both\r\nin Russian Zionism and in the movement at large. So in every Jewish\r\ncentre in Russia the “Lovers of _Zion_” movement attracted the best of\r\nJewish energy and idealism, especially among the youth, and the idea\r\nof the return to _Zion_ took a firmer and firmer hold on the people\r\nand demanded more and more imperatively an outlet in practical work.\r\nIn Poland and Galicia and Roumania, and to a lesser extent in Germany,\r\nthe movement spread during the eighties and nineties of last century,\r\nso that when Herzl came on the scene the national consciousness to\r\nwhich he appealed was largely awakened (though not in those elements\r\nof Jewry to which he first addressed his call). In countries further\r\nwest there was little progress until after the creation of Herzl’s\r\norganization. True there were _Chovevé Zion_ groups in England and\r\nFrance, but the idea of the return had not really struck root in\r\nthe Jewish communities of those countries. One of the great services\r\nrendered by Herzl’s organization to the cause of Jewish nationalism\r\nis that it has provided a bridge over which the Jewish spirit and the\r\nidealism of the reawakened Jewries of Eastern Europe could make their\r\nway into the Western communities and give them new life and a new\r\nsense of the realities of Judaism. Thus in Anglo-Jewry during the last\r\ndecade or so there has been a marked tendency away from the polite\r\nconventions of assimilation towards a realization of the deeper and\r\nmore serious implications of Jewishness; and only a remnant of the\r\n“old guard” still repeats the _shibboleths_ of an earlier generation\r\nabout Judaism as a “persuasion” and “emancipation” as a cure for all\r\nthe ills of Jewry.\r\n\r\nWe have spoken of the part that the Jewish student has played in this\r\nevolution, and it is so important as to merit further examination.\r\n\r\nThe position of the Jewish students at the Universities of Western\r\nEurope at the beginning of the third quarter of the last century was a\r\nmost deplorable one from a Jewish point of view. They had increased in\r\nnumbers, belonging partly to the native Jewish populations and partly\r\nto Eastern Europe, nevertheless they were a negligible quantity. They\r\nwere scattered all over Germany, Austria and Switzerland as units\r\nwithout cohesion or organization. Nationally they did not count: the\r\nchief principle of assimilation――which was at the time the general\r\ntendency of Western European Jewry――was to abandon Jewish national\r\nclaims. Their attitude towards the religion of their fathers was one\r\nof indifference, want of faith, if not hostility. What marked them\r\nout as Jews was in fact only the treatment meted out to them by the\r\nanti-Semitic Students’ Societies, which hated and insulted them. And\r\nwhile the Jews born in the Western European countries were regarded\r\nas outcasts by the non-Jewish corporations and societies, the foreign\r\nJewish students――mostly from Russia――were regarded as outcasts by\r\nthe outcasts. The Western European and the Eastern European Jewish\r\nstudents were thus divided into two fractions.\r\n\r\nThen the new spirit of Zionism made itself felt. A group of Jewish\r\nstudents at the Vienna University founded, in 1882, a National Jewish\r\nStudents’ Association called “_Kadima_,”¹ which was later, as we\r\nhave seen, the first organization to extend a welcome to Herzl.\r\nThese Vienna students have a better claim than any other similar\r\norganization in Western Europe to be regarded as the pioneers of the\r\nJewish national idea.\r\n\r\n    ¹ “Eastward,” “Forward.”\r\n\r\nOne of the leaders of the _Kadima_ was Nathan Birnbaum, known also by\r\nhis _nom de plume_ of “Mathias Acher,” who was born in Galicia and\r\ngraduated at Vienna University. A powerful writer and a keen thinker,\r\nhe became, in course of time, a considerable figure in German-Jewish\r\nliterature. In recent years he has become a Jewish democrat,\r\nchampioning the cause of _Yiddish_. But in the early days of the\r\n_Kadima_ he was heart and soul devoted to this Association, of which\r\nhe was the philosophical leader.\r\n\r\nThe members of the _Kadima_ soon attracted attention owing to their\r\ncourageous attitude, and steadily increased in number. They had become\r\nconscious Jews, and derived from this fact a great access of moral\r\nstrength. They were no longer weak, downtrodden, degraded young men,\r\nfeeling helpless and demoralized; they began to be men, jealous of\r\ntheir honour, demanding their rights as Jews among the nationalities.\r\nThe _Chovevé Zion_ movement appealed strongly to their emotions and\r\nenergies. The idea, a mere spark at first, developed into a blazing\r\nfire that seized upon several Universities. Young Jews speaking\r\ndifferent languages and of many different habits and customs became\r\nunited by invisible ties all over the Continent of Europe. At the\r\nend of the eighties there existed an important Association in Berlin,\r\nwhich was at first somewhat theoretical in character, but very soon\r\nafterwards became a sister society of the Vienna Association, taking\r\nalso the name of “_Kadima_” (Appendix lxxvii). The members of this\r\ngroup include a great number of workers whose names are inseparably\r\nbound up with the history of the Zionist Organization and with Jewish\r\nnational literature. Most of them were of Russian birth, as might\r\nbe expected; for it was the Russian Jewish student who, moving from\r\none German University to another, carried with him the torch of the\r\nnational revival. Besides Dr. Chaim Weizmann, already mentioned, we\r\nfind in the Berlin Students’ group two of the present members of the\r\nInner Actions Committee――Dr. Shemaryah Levin, a powerful speaker and\r\none of the most energetic propagandists of the movement, and Victor\r\nJacobsohn, who for some years represented Zionism at Constantinople.\r\nMartin Buber and Berthold Feiwel, two gifted littérateurs, were\r\nboth members of the Vienna _Kadima_ who worked later in Berlin.\r\nDavis Trietsch, not himself a University student, worked in close\r\nco-operation with the Berlin group. An indefatigable advocate of\r\ncolonization schemes, he has given a great impetus to the study of\r\nPalestine and has originated many fruitful ideas. Associated with\r\nhim on the staff of the _Jüdischer Verlag_, the Zionist publishing\r\nhouse, was the artist Ephraim Moses _ben_ Jacob _Hacohen_ Lilien,\r\nwho together with Hermann Struck, an artist of a very different type,\r\nbest represents Jewish national development on the æsthetic side.\r\nIt remains to mention two Berlin Zionists who became members of the\r\nInner Actions Committee in 1911――Arthur Hantke, distinguished for\r\nhis services to the organization of the movement, and Professor Otto\r\nWarburg, a well-known botanist and founder of the Palestine Land\r\nDevelopment Company.\r\n\r\nSimilar associations to the _Kadima_ were founded at many German and\r\nSwiss Universities――Heidelberg, Munich, Leipzig, Königsberg, Breslau,\r\nBerne, Zürich, Geneva and Lausanne. To them is due the national\r\nawakening which has led to so great an improvement in the spiritual\r\ncondition of Jewry in Western Europe. In Germany especially the\r\nprogress of the national idea among the younger generation was\r\nphenomenal. The sons of the most assimilated and denationalized\r\nfamilies became the most ardent champions of the new movement back\r\nto the Jewish land and Jewish ideals. But much the same thing has\r\nhappened in all countries which have a considerable Jewish population.\r\nIn Russia it goes without saying that Jewish Students’ groups were to\r\nthe fore in the national work. Even in the Polish cities of Warsaw and\r\nLodz, the homes of the most extreme and disintegrating assimilation,\r\nnumbers of Jewish students at the Universities were kindled by the\r\nnational idea and did it valuable service. In Anglo-Jewry, isolated by\r\ndistance and by difference of language and environment from the main\r\ncurrents of Jewish life, the university Zionist movement developed\r\nlater and has not gone so far. Its history belongs entirely to the\r\nlast dozen years, and its adherents are still a small band. But\r\nit is one of the most remarkable and promising features of Zionist\r\ndevelopment in England in recent years. While the older generation of\r\nZionists in this country worked mainly in the field of organization,\r\na group of younger men, largely of University training, has paid more\r\nattention to the spread of the Zionist idea by means of literature and\r\neducation. Most of these younger men have been influenced by the ideas\r\nof _Achad Ha’am_. They have produced monthly journals, pamphlets and\r\nbooks on Zionism and in the Zionist spirit, and have contributed in\r\nvarious ways to the spread of Jewish knowledge and the improvement\r\nof _Hebrew_ education. They have also taken their share in the work\r\nof organization, and one of them, Mr. H. Sacher, has recently become\r\nGrand Commander of the Order of Ancient _Maccabæans_, a Zionist\r\nassociation organised on Friendly Society lines.\r\n\r\n\r\n         3. _The Pioneers of the Hebrew Revival in Palestine_\r\n\r\nWhile modern _Hebrew_ literature and the propaganda of the Return to\r\nZion were quickening the Jews of the Diaspora to new life and new hope,\r\nthere were not wanting men who were prepared to throw up their careers\r\nand prospects in Europe in order themselves to help in laying the\r\nfoundations of the revival in Palestine. It is not our purpose here\r\nto tell the almost miraculous story of the foundation of the earliest\r\nJewish settlements or “colonies” in the eighties, how by sheer\r\nendurance the pioneer settlers maintained their hold in the face of\r\nappalling difficulties, and how by the time when the great war broke\r\nout there had been created the nucleus of a thriving _Hebrew_ nation,\r\nfirmly attached once more to its ancestral soil, and repossessed\r\nof its ancestral tongue.¹ We have merely to glance at a few of the\r\noutstanding facts and personalities of this revival (Appendix lxxviii).\r\n\r\n    ¹ For an account of Jewish colonization in Palestine the\r\n      reader may be referred to _Palestine: the Rebirth of an\r\n      Ancient People_, by A. M. Hyamson (London: Sidgwick and\r\n      Jackson, 1917), _chs._ 11‒14.\r\n\r\nThe revival is not wholly, though it is largely, a result of the\r\nterrible events which drove large masses of Jews to emigrate from\r\nRussia in 1880‒1881. Even before that date there were a few Jews\r\nin Palestine who, if they were not strong enough of themselves to\r\ninitiate a national revival, were able to help when new forces came\r\nfrom without. Of these were Jechiel Brill (1836‒1886), who, born in\r\nRussia and educated in Constantinople and _Jerusalem_, established a\r\n_Hebrew_ monthly, _Ha’lebanon_, in Palestine in 1863, and later was\r\ncommissioned by Baron Edmond _de_ Rothschild to conduct a group of\r\nexperienced farmers from Russia through Palestine; Jechiel Michael\r\n_ben_ Noah Pines (1842‒1912), also of Russian birth, who in 1878 was\r\nsent to _Jerusalem_ to establish charitable institutions associated\r\nwith the name of Sir Moses Montefiore, and lived thenceforward in\r\nPalestine, interesting himself in the welfare of the Jewish community\r\nand the organization of the Jewish agricultural colonies; David\r\nYellin, a native of Palestine and one of the most eminent of living\r\n_Hebraists_, who has devoted himself mainly to education, and has\r\nplayed a large part in the development of _Hebrew_ as a living\r\nlanguage through his contributions to the perfection of the “natural\r\nmethod” of teaching _Hebrew_; and the late Abraham Moses Luncz\r\n(1854‒1918), who had lived in Palestine from early youth, and whose\r\nlong-established _Hebrew_ Palestine Annual has done much for the\r\nhistorical and geographical study of the country. But it was not till\r\nthe immigration which followed on the Russian massacres of 1880‒1881\r\nthat Jewish life in Palestine really began to take a new direction.\r\nAmong the stalwarts of those early days a group of Russian students\r\nknown as _Bilu_ (Appendix lxxix) (from the initials of the four\r\n_Hebrew_ words meaning “Come, let us go up to the house of Jacob,”\r\nwhich they chose as their motto) will always be held in affectionate\r\nremembrance. Their example of stubborn endurance and unfailing\r\noptimism did much to rescue the colonization movement from the ruin\r\nwhich threatened it in its early days, when the natural effects of\r\ninsufficient knowledge and resources began to be felt. Most of the\r\ngroup died young, but a few still survive――among them Israel Belkind,\r\nwho is still at work in Palestine as a teacher. Elieser Ben-Jehuda,\r\nwho settled in _Jerusalem_ in 1881, is associated principally with\r\nthe revival of _Hebrew_. It is thanks largely to him that out of the\r\nwelter of languages spoken by Jews in Palestine _Hebrew_ has once\r\nand for all won its place as _the_ national language. His monumental\r\n_Hebrew_ dictionary, _Thesaurus Totius Hebraitatis_, in ten volumes,\r\nwas in course of publication when the war broke out. Another side of\r\nthe revival is represented by Boris Schatz, the founder and head of\r\nthe _Bezalel_ School of Arts and Crafts at _Jerusalem_, whose idea\r\nof creating a distinctively Jewish art has already borne good fruit\r\n(Appendix lxxx). And in yet other spheres the young Jewish settlement\r\nowes much to David Levontin, Manager of the Anglo-Palestine Company,\r\nthe Jewish banking concern in Palestine; to Aaron Aaronsohn, head of\r\nthe valuable Agricultural Experiment Station at Atlit, near _Haifa_;\r\nto Dr. Benzion Mossinsohn and his colleagues at the _Jaffa_ Hebrew\r\nSecondary School, where an education similar to that of a Grammar\r\nSchool is given entirely in _Hebrew_. Each of these men has done\r\npioneer work in one field or another. They have stood in the van of\r\na movement which has transformed Jewish life in Palestine as Zionist\r\npropaganda has transformed Jewish life in the Diaspora, not only\r\ncreating new types and values of its own, but surely if slowly\r\nbreaking down the resistance of the anti-national Jewish agencies\r\nwhich were at work in Palestine before Zionism came on the scene. And\r\nif the propaganda and organization of Zionism have been essential to\r\nthe existence and growth of the Palestinian settlement, it is no less\r\ntrue that if not for the work of those who built up the new Jewish\r\nlife in Palestine, there would have been no inspiring force behind the\r\npropaganda of Zionism, and no solid basis for its organization.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER L.\r\n\r\n                          ZIONISM IN FRANCE\r\n\r\n    David Wolffsohn――France――_M._ Léon Bourgeois――Michel Erlanger\r\n    ――Zadoc Kahn――Baron Edmond _de_ Rothschild――Professor Joseph\r\n    Halévy――Dr. Emil Meyersohn――Dr. Waldemar Haffkine――The\r\n    brothers Marmorek――Bernard Lazare.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN its early years the new Zionist movement showed perhaps\r\ninsufficient appreciation of the importance of Palestinian colonizing\r\nwork. Its attention was turned mainly in another direction, that of\r\npaving the way for a great resettlement of the Jewish people by the\r\ncreation of favourable political conditions; and the plodding and\r\noften blundering work of the _Chovevé Zion_ seemed to some of its\r\nleaders and many of their followers to be poor, petty and uninspiring\r\nby comparison with the wide sweep and the brilliance of their own\r\nideal. But as time went on, and it became obvious that in the main\r\nthe new movement must look for support to those who had worked for the\r\nsame end as “Lovers of _Zion_,” the necessary adjustment between the\r\nnew and the older methods had to be made; and the internal history of\r\nZionism since 1897 is one of the penetration of _Chovevé Zion_ ideas\r\ninto the large framework created by the master-mind of Herzl under\r\nthe stress of ideas somewhat different. It is not our intention to\r\ntrace this history here¹ (Appendix lxxxi): we are concerned less with\r\nthe inner history of the movement than with its repercussions in the\r\nliterature and the politics of England and France. It may suffice to\r\nsay that the Congresses, held first annually and afterwards biennially,\r\nattracted an ever-growing number of delegates and an ever-increasing\r\namount of attention; that in its early years the movement established\r\na Jewish National Fund for the purpose of buying land in Palestine on\r\na great scale, and a financial instrument, the Jewish Colonial Trust,\r\nwhich in turn founded the Anglo-Palestine Company for the conduct of\r\nactual banking business in Palestine (Appendix lxxxii); that after the\r\ndeath of Herzl in 1904, and the rejection of the offer by the British\r\nGovernment of a piece of territory in East Africa, there developed a\r\nsomewhat serious fissure between the two tendencies in the movement,\r\nthe one looking to political activity and the other to Palestinian\r\ncolonization as the right line of progress; that Herzl’s friend\r\nand follower, David Wolffsohn (1856‒1914) (Appendix lxxxiii), who\r\nsucceeded him as President, was able by a rare combination of gifts to\r\nhold the movement together during the period of crisis; that after the\r\nTurkish Revolution in 1908, which seemed to make political activity\r\nimpossible or useless, there was a marked concentration of effort\r\non Palestinian development; that meanwhile the Zionist organization\r\nspread to the four corners of the globe, and societies and federations\r\nwere formed not only in every country in Europe, but also in all parts\r\nof the British Dominions, and particularly in the United States of\r\nAmerica; and that the outbreak of war found the movement in a position\r\nto point both to a large membership――about a quarter of a million――and\r\nto substantial achievements in Palestine in support of its claim for\r\nthe definite reconstitution of the Jews as a nation in their ancient\r\nland.\r\n\r\n    ¹ For a general history of the movement see _Zionism_, by\r\n      Prof. R. Gottheil (Jewish Publication Society of America,\r\n      Philadelphia, 1914).\r\n\r\n  Illustration: DAVID WOLFFSOHN\r\n\r\nWe turn from this brief summary to the impression made by the new\r\nmovement in France and in England.\r\n\r\nIn France, where there had always been statesmen and writers who\r\nhad a proper understanding of the Zionist idea, the most notable\r\npronouncement from a non-Jewish source came from M. Léon Bourgeois,\r\none of the greatest French statesmen of the present generation. His\r\nviews, as imparted to Baroness Bertha _von_ Suttner (1843‒1914), were\r\npublished by her in 1899:――¹\r\n\r\n    ¹ Zionisten und Christen ... Emil Kronberger ... Leipzig ...\r\n      1900. _pp._ 117‒119.\r\n\r\n“Bourgeois held forth to me enthusiastically and explained the\r\nvarious reasons why according to his view the movement should be\r\nsupported. Complete assimilation――not altogether impossible after\r\na long time――looms still in the far distance; until then very many\r\nindividuals――if they do not break away――must suffer. The individual\r\nis still everywhere the highest consideration, collectivism is only\r\nan abstract conception. Until now the Jews have been too strongly\r\ndifferentiated from their surroundings to assimilate without being\r\nnoticed. They are recognizable for their shortcomings as well as for\r\ntheir most outstanding virtues. Difference does not mean inferiority;\r\nno one will allow himself to be insulted because he belongs to this\r\nor that ethnical group. To be a Zionist means to make a stand against\r\nanti-Semitism. The people among whom they live are even more injured\r\nby Jew-hatred than the Jews; it is opposed to culture, and prevents\r\nthe realization of the ideal of peace. Culture happily unites all\r\nits objects more closely and aims at an unattainable ideal, but all\r\ngood works are directed towards paving the way to future success.\r\nTherefore every fresh sign of energy is welcome. From a nation newly\r\nreconstituted, full of energy, and composed of such intelligent,\r\ncapable and talented elements, an increase in the general work of\r\nculture may be expected. Therefore Zionism is to be encouraged. It\r\nis self-understood that the first necessity is to bring relief to a\r\npersecuted and unfortunate people. But I wish to clear up this side\r\nof the question, which belongs to the future; to bring forward such\r\narguments as are debated. In our Chauvinistic circles, the following\r\nargument will be brought forward: Let us be glad that in the Jews we\r\npossess a cosmopolitan element; that the scholar, the artist and the\r\nthinker amongst them work and create without reference to national\r\nideas. But that kind of argument is false, because to be cosmopolitan,\r\nto recognize that the interests of humanity outweigh those of one’s\r\nfatherland, or still more to understand this, one must, before all\r\nthings, have a fatherland.”\r\n\r\nWhat is remarkable about these views is their similarity in some\r\nrespects to those expressed in 1866 by Moses Hess in his _Rom und\r\nJerusalem_. Hess, though himself a German Jew writing in German,\r\nconnected Zionism with the political rôle of France. He regarded the\r\nFrench Revolution as one of the great events that were to prepare the\r\nrestoration of Israel, and therefore he looked to France for help.\r\nFrance had extended her protection to the Roman Catholics of Syria,\r\nand was the _beau idéal_ and the _avant courier_ of human progress.\r\nThe renationalization of humanity was his aim. He realized the\r\ndistinctiveness of the Jew. He said that Jews and Germans were as the\r\npoles asunder in thought and conceptions of life, and the logic of\r\nhistory and the necessities of humanity made him plead for _Zion_ to\r\nbe restored. Nature’s economy, he said, demands that the Jew should\r\nlead his own life, in his own fashion, and in his own country. He\r\npleaded in the first place for a reaction against Hellenistic theories\r\nof life: to him family life was sacred; the mother’s love was the\r\nreal sacred source of Jewish persistence, because it was spiritual yet\r\nnot unreal. From the family to the nation was but a step; the family\r\nshould possess in the individual what the nation should uphold in the\r\nmass. He attacked most scornfully the German-Jewish Reform movement,\r\nnot because he was of the ultra-orthodox school, but because there\r\nhad been no real Reformation in Judaism. He believed in the upholding\r\nof traditional observances not because of their religious utility,\r\nbut because they were expressive of the Jewish nation, because many\r\nof them link us to the remote past. Seeing the gradual disappearance\r\nof the little groups of emancipated Jews, and the great misery of the\r\nbulk of the Jewish people, he watched most jealously and anxiously\r\nover their destiny, desiring to preserve their original purity and\r\nancestral dignity. “The Jew should live his own life,” said Hess:\r\n“Welcome to all fresh and sound symptoms of energy,” said Bourgeois.\r\nIt is the same idea, bespeaking the same sense of humanity and real\r\nequality.\r\n\r\nAs regards the Jews of France, we have already shown how real were the\r\nZionist sympathies of the leaders of the “Alliance” in the sixties.\r\nTheir successors did not fall below them in this respect. Thus Michel\r\nErlanger (1828‒1892), an active member of the Central Committee of\r\nthe “Alliance” and Vice-President of the “_Consistoire_” _de Paris_,\r\npromoted most energetically the colonization of Palestine. It was to a\r\ngreat extent through his invitation that Baron Edmond _de_ Rothschild\r\ncame to assist the colonies. The success of the Baron’s undertakings\r\nwas largely due to Erlanger’s knowledge of the localities and their\r\nconditions, to his practical understanding and to the energy which\r\nhe brought to bear upon the work, inspired by a love for the sacred\r\ncause which triumphed over difficulties. His practical mind saw that\r\nthe Holy Land was far better suited than any other country to be a\r\nreal home for the Jew. We have already mentioned the Grand _Rabbin_ of\r\nFrance, M. Zadoc Kahn, in connection with the first Zionist Congress.\r\nNo man played a more important part in the early colonization of\r\nPalestine than this admirable spiritual leader, with his great\r\nstrength of character, personal influence and immense popularity. A\r\nman of great dignity and wisdom, a fine personality in the noblest\r\nsense of the term, he helped all undertakings in favour of Palestine.\r\nAll the Palestinian deputations, and those from other countries with\r\nschemes for the benefit of Palestine, addressed themselves to him; all\r\ntheir cares and troubles fell upon his shoulders. He was engaged in\r\nthis herculean task for some years, and rendered invaluable service\r\nto the work of colonization. And there was always at Paris a group of\r\ninfluential supporters of the Palestinian idea. Besides Baron Edmond\r\n_de_ Rothschild, the great benefactor of Palestine, there were the\r\nfamous scholar, Professor Joseph Halévy (1827‒1918), who was already\r\nhalf a century ago one of the pioneers of a _Hebrew_ Revival in the\r\nEast; Dr. Waldemar Mordecai Wolff Haffkine, C.I.E., member of the\r\nInstitut Pasteur, who afterwards made a great name for himself by his\r\nimportant medical work in India; and Dr. Emil Meyersohn (at present\r\none of the directors of the Jewish Colonization Association), an\r\neminent scholar who, thanks to his exceptional experience, was able\r\nto reorganize the old system of colonization in Palestine.\r\n\r\nThus French Jewry has never been the impregnable citadel of\r\nassimilation which it is sometimes represented as being. Herzl’s\r\nmovement evoked a response in quarters which hitherto had been\r\nstrangers to the Palestinian idea; and though a fusion between the old\r\nand the new Zionists was not effected for some time, yet essentially\r\nthe two sections stood for one and the same thing. The new Zionist\r\norganization gained its footing in France through the formation, soon\r\nafter the first Congress, of the “_Fédération Sioniste_,” the chief\r\npillar of which was, of course, Max Nordau.\r\n\r\nDr. Alexander Marmorek, a well-known physician, and one of the most\r\nprominent Zionists since the very beginning of the movement, was\r\nfor several years President of the Federation. Alexander and his\r\ntwo brothers Oscar and Isidore were the principal advocates of the\r\nnational idea in academic circles. The youthful career of Isidore was\r\nunhappily cut short by death. Oscar (1863‒1910) worked for a number\r\nof years with Herzl, but an untimely death robbed the movement of him\r\nalso. The most gifted and most enthusiastic of the three brothers is\r\nstill active in the movement. These leaders of French Zionism were\r\nassisted by the late M. Berr, Mdlle. Marie Schach, Dr. Jacobsohn, Dr.\r\nNahum Slousch, and others.\r\n\r\nSpecial notice is due to one of the first followers of Herzl――Bernard\r\nLazare (1856‒1904).¹\r\n\r\n    ¹ His name was Lazare Bernard.\r\n\r\nBorn at Nîmes, Bernard Lazare left his native place at an early\r\nage and came to Paris. He studied paleography and history at the\r\nSorbonne, and was engaged for a time on archæological work, but soon\r\nentered upon a literary and journalistic career. He contributed to\r\nthe _Figaro_, the _Echo de Paris_ and other dailies, founded _L’Action\r\nSociale_, issued a pamphlet about the Panama affair and was the author\r\nof a few novels. The publication of his _L’Antisémitisme, son histoire\r\net ses causes_ led to a duel with Edouard Drumout.\r\n\r\nLazare was the pioneer of the agitation which led to the release\r\nof Captain Alfred Dreyfus; his pamphlets on the _affaire_ were\r\nundoubtedly the primary causes of the revision. Another subject\r\nin which he was deeply interested was the condition of the Jews\r\nin Roumania. He repeatedly raised his voice on their behalf in the\r\nleading reviews, in that clear, incisive style which was his own. He\r\nwas also an enthusiastic adherent of Herzl and an ardent Zionist. He\r\ncame back to national Judaism after all his achievements for humanity\r\nin the Socialist movement and in the literature and politics of his\r\ngreat country, and became an eloquent champion of the new Jew. A clear\r\nthinker and a gifted writer, he contributed brilliant Zionist articles\r\nto the _Flambeau_ and the _Echo Sioniste_. It was surprising how\r\nthis real French patriot and intellectual came to lay bare his Jewish\r\nsoul and Jewish individuality, and with what power of conviction he\r\ndefended the immutable rights of this individuality.\r\n\r\n“Le Sionisme,” he wrote in 1900, “c’est l’affirmation de notre\r\npersonalité. Nous avons confiance en nous mêmes, en notre génie, en\r\nnotre destin pour être dignes de notre passé.... Nous ne serions pas\r\ndignes de notre passé, si notre histoire ne nous inspirait des pensées\r\npour l’avenir et si nous ne comprendrions pas qu’il faut que nous\r\nayons un foyer, un centre pour former notre univers, si grand ou\r\npetit qu’il soit, à l’image de notre idéal, de notre civilization,\r\nde notre pensée et de notre sensibilité. C’est la véritable solution\r\ndu problème. Nous ne voulons pas l’absorption et l’anéantissement, la\r\ndisparition, la paix du cimetière, la mort sans phrase. Pour hurter\r\navec les loups――est-ce-que c’est notre mission? Non. Nous réclamons\r\nnotre titre à nous d’être un ouvrier utile dans le grand atelier\r\nde l’humanité. Notre rôle déjà grand, grandira encore. Ce sera la\r\ntriomphe du droit sur la force brutale, du droit de l’individuelle\r\npersonne humaine et des collectives personnes qui sont les nations.\r\nOn a beau dire que puisqu’il y a certaines groups des israélites\r\ndenationalisés, la nation n’existe plus. Mais ces petits groupes ne\r\ncomptent pour rien. Il y a un peuple juif qui compte, c’est la grande\r\nmajorité, ceux qui ont un passé et des traditions dont ils sont fiers\r\net dont ils ont la garde.”¹\r\n\r\n    ¹ Le National Juif, Paris, 1898.\r\n\r\nM. Lazare displayed a warm interest in the various questions of\r\nZionism, and always took a national and democratic view. Though\r\nshortly before his death he retired from Zionist activity on account\r\nof a difference of opinion between himself and Herzl on a point of\r\ntactics with regard to Turkey (Lazare proposed an alliance with the\r\nYoung Turks), he remained a convinced Zionist. He will live in Jewish\r\nmemory much more as a Zionist than as a “Dreyfusard.” His death in\r\n1904 was an irreparable loss to Zionism in France.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER LI.\r\n\r\n                          ZIONISM IN ENGLAND\r\n\r\n    The first leaders――Herzl before the Royal Commission on\r\n    Immigration――The East Africa offer――Death of Herzl――Holman\r\n    Hunt――Report of United States Consul at Beirut on Zionism\r\n    ――Lord Robert Cecil――The Palestine Exploration Fund――Colonel\r\n    Conder――Lord Gwydyr――Zionism and the Arab question.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE turn now to England, where the Zionist idea continued to find\r\ninfluential support after the foundation of the new movement.\r\n\r\nDr. Herzl’s appreciation of the importance of England for Zionism may\r\nbe illustrated by quotations from two of his letters:――\r\n\r\n                                          “VIENNA, _Feb. 28th_.\r\n\r\n    “MR. CHAIRMAN,――My friends in England know how much I feel\r\n    drawn towards them, and how much I expect from them for the\r\n    work common and dear to all of us. From the first moment I\r\n    entered the movement my eyes were directed towards England,\r\n    because I saw that by reason of the general situation of\r\n    things there, that it was the Archimedean point where the\r\n    lever could be applied....\r\n\r\n                                                “THEODOR HERZL.\r\n\r\n    “To the Chairman of the English Zionist Conference.”¹\r\n\r\n    ¹ Zionist Conference held at the Clerkenwell Town Hall on\r\n      March 6th, 1898. Report of Proceedings. London ... 1898.\r\n      _p._ 22. (8º. 94 _pp._ in printed wrapper. [B. M.]) Special\r\n      number of Palestina. The _Chovevé Zion_ Quarterly.\r\n\r\nAgain, in a letter to Viscount Milner, dated January 3, 1903, he\r\nwrote:――\r\n\r\n“All the freedom and equality of rights of the British Jews, the\r\nhappy situation even of foreign Jews in the British Colonies, and the\r\nhumane protection which England’s Government grants, by their protests\r\nagainst the persecution of our brethren, all this is a bond which\r\nunites us all closely to your glorious nation.... Some day, we shall\r\nbe able to prove our gratitude to Great and Greater Britain.”\r\n\r\nEngland was made, almost as a matter of course, the home of the\r\nfinancial institutions of Zionism: the Jewish National Fund, the\r\nJewish Colonial Trust and the Anglo-Palestine Company are registered\r\nas English Companies. Hence English Zionists have had a position and\r\nan influence in the movement which would hardly have been warranted\r\non the ground of mere numbers. Conditions have, however, been\r\nunfavourable to any rapid growth of the organization in this country.\r\nThe official Jewish community, with its rather parochial view, long\r\nlooked askance at Zionism, and until quite recent years those who\r\nfollowed Herzl have been a minority struggling hard against a vast\r\namount of prejudice and of indifference. None the less, such English\r\nZionists as Dr. M. Gaster (_Haham_ of the Spanish and Portuguese\r\nCongregations), Herbert Bentwich, Joseph Cowen, L. J. Greenberg and\r\nIsrael Zangwill (who left the movement after some years to found\r\nthe Jewish Territorial Organization) have played a prominent part in\r\nshaping Zionist policy; and more recently, as we have remarked above,\r\na group of younger men has come forward.\r\n\r\nIf Herzl had the intuition as to the importance of England, it\r\nmay fairly be said that England more rapidly than any other Power\r\nrecognized the significance of Herzl’s movement. The holding of the\r\nfourth Congress in London in 1900 evoked a great deal of favourable\r\ncomment in the English Press (Appendix lxxxiv). And more official\r\nrecognition was not wanting. In 1902 Herzl was invited to give\r\nevidence before the Royal Commission on Immigration. That fact alone\r\nsufficiently indicates that the title of Zionism to a voice on a\r\nquestion affecting large masses of Jews was accepted in England, even\r\nin those early days of the movement, as a matter of course. But a\r\nstill more striking recognition of Zionism on the part of the British\r\nGovernment was to follow before long.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1902, the Executive of the Zionist Organization entered\r\ninto negotiations with the British Government for part of the _Sinai_\r\nPeninsula to be granted to the Jews with powers of self-government.\r\nThese negotiations broke down owing to certain stipulations on the\r\npart of the Egyptian Government, and the Colonial Office then made the\r\nZionists an offer of territory in British East Africa. The terms of\r\nthis offer are contained in a letter of the 14th August, 1903, to Mr.\r\nL. J. Greenberg in regard “to the form of an agreement which Dr. Herzl\r\nproposes should be entered into between His Majesty’s Government and\r\nthe Jewish Colonial Trust, Ltd., for the establishment of a Jewish\r\nsettlement in East Africa.” The letter states that the Marquis of\r\nLansdowne (then Foreign Minister) “has studied the question with\r\nthe interest which His Majesty’s Government must always take in\r\nany well-considered scheme for the amelioration of the position of\r\nthe Jewish race.... If a site can be found which the Trust and H.M.\r\nCommission find suitable, Lord Lansdowne will be prepared to entertain\r\nfavourably proposals for the establishment of a Jewish colony or\r\nsettlement on conditions which will enable the members to observe\r\ntheir national customs ... the scheme comprising as its main features\r\nthe grant of a considerable area of land, the appointment of a Jewish\r\nOfficial as the chief of the local administration, and permission\r\nto the colony to have a free hand in regard to municipal legislation\r\nas to the management of religious and purely domestic matters, such\r\nlocal autonomy being conditional upon the right of H.M. Government to\r\nexercise general control.” This announcement gave rise to considerable\r\nexcitement in the Zionist camp. The most ardent Zionists believed that\r\nit meant that Zionism was to give up its efforts for the acquisition\r\nof Palestine and to regard the settlement in East Africa as its goal,\r\nand they accordingly, and rightly, opposed this presumed alteration\r\nof the original programme. Others maintained that this alteration\r\nwas never contemplated. British East Africa was not to take the place\r\nof Palestine, but only to serve as a place of temporary refuge for\r\nthose unfortunate Jews who, under the horrible conditions imposed\r\nupon them, could not live in the unfriendly countries of their birth,\r\nand wait there until Palestine became a Jewish country. After most\r\nexciting debates, the Sixth Congress finally adopted a proposal to\r\nexpress the thanks of the Jewish people to the British Government\r\nfor its magnanimous offer, which was unique in history, and to send\r\na commission of experts to East Africa to investigate the territory.\r\nEven this tentative acceptance of the scheme in principle was bitterly\r\nopposed by a large section of delegates, especially those from\r\nRussia, who viewed with profound distrust any deviation from the\r\npure Palestinian programme. The Commission of enquiry started on its\r\njourney towards the end of the year 1904, and in May, 1905, presented\r\nits report, which was not favourable enough to justify Zionist action\r\nfor the purpose of establishing a Jewish colony. The death of Herzl\r\nhad taken place in the meantime (3rd July, 1904).\r\n\r\nThe British East Africa offer not only precipitated a crisis within\r\nZionism, but also――and herein lies its significance――raised Zionism\r\nto the rank of a political movement of international importance, and\r\ndemonstrated the interest of the British Government in a solution of\r\nthe Jewish problem. But after this brilliant success circumstances\r\nbrought it about that the movement had virtually to leave for a time\r\nthe political arena into which Herzl had taken it, and to concentrate\r\non the strengthening of its organization and the development of the\r\nJewish holding in Palestine. The results achieved in both fields have\r\namply compensated Zionism for the comparative absence of _réclame_\r\nand of more sensational triumphs. It is, indeed, largely thanks to the\r\nquiet constructive work of the ten years preceding the outbreak of war,\r\nthat the movement is to-day in a position to assert with confidence\r\nits claim to a hearing in the peace settlement.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, however, the opportunity was lacking for any further\r\nco-operation between the British Government and Zionism. This was\r\npartly due to the course taken by British policy in the Near East,\r\nwith which we shall deal in the next chapter. But there was no\r\ndiminution of the sympathy shown by English thinkers and writers for\r\nthe Zionist idea. We quote here a few characteristic utterances of\r\nthis later period, the period of Zionism in its modern form.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1896 Holman Hunt, the famous painter, advocated the\r\nZionist idea in its most radical form, that of a Jewish state in\r\nPalestine. A contribution to the columns of the _Jewish Chronicle_, 21\r\nFebruary, 1896, _p._ 9, entitled “Mr. Holman Hunt on the Resettlement\r\nof the Jews in Palestine,” contains a letter addressed by him from\r\nDraycott Lodge, Fulham, Jan. 6th, 1896, to an eminent Jew, which\r\nexpresses ideas similar in every way to those of Dr. Herzl. He saw\r\nlooming in the distance an approaching war “which would entail the\r\ndestruction and maiming of countless legions of the choicest men\r\nof the noble races of the civilised world, and with this would come\r\nthe disappearance of wealth, and the ruin of the richest....” “He\r\nsought a remedy against the impending evil, and was led to suggest\r\nthe restoration of Palestine to the Jews, both for the sake of the\r\nadvantages which would accrue to the Jews themselves and in order to\r\nremove a bone of contention out of the way of the European Powers.”\r\n“Palestine will soon become a direful field of contention to the\r\ninfernally armed forces of the European Powers, so that it is\r\ncalculated to provoke a curse to the world of the most appalling\r\ncharacter. Russia and Greece will contend for the interests of the\r\nGreek Church, France and Italy for the Latin, Prussia and Austria\r\nfor the German political interests.... In addition to the above-named\r\ncertain contenders for Palestine, there would be England....” Holman\r\nHunt spoke like a prophet, though not in every detail.\r\n\r\nNor was the actual colonizing work in Palestine without recognition in\r\nthe English Press:――¹\r\n\r\n    ¹ _The Times_, Monday, May 8, 1899, p. 12.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _Jewish Colonies in Palestine_\r\n\r\nThe United States Consul at Beirut, in a report which has lately been\r\nissued by the Department of State in Washington, (on) the condition of\r\nthe numerous Jewish colonies in Palestine.... The Consul thinks that,\r\nwhether the Zionist movement succeeds in its special aim or not, the\r\nagitation aids in the development of Palestine――a country “which will\r\ngenerously respond to modern influences....” The Zionist movement,\r\nalso, is said to be bringing out new qualities in the Jews inhabiting\r\nthe country; they are ... beginning to act on the principle that “to\r\ntill the ground is to worship God.”... On the whole, the Consul thinks\r\n“the prospects are brighter than ever for the Jews in Palestine and\r\nfor Palestine itself. European influence has obtained a foothold in\r\nthe country, and the tide of modern ideas cannot be long debarred.”\r\n\r\nIt may be added that during the Parliamentary Elections of 1900 the\r\nEnglish Zionist Federation addressed to all candidates a letter asking\r\nfor an expression of sympathy with Zionism, and between ninety and a\r\nhundred replies were received, the great majority of an exceedingly\r\nfavourable nature; and that in 1906 Lord Robert Cecil wrote: “The\r\ncentral idea underlying the Zionist movement seems to me worthy of all\r\nsupport. Apart from all other considerations, it appears to me that\r\nthe restoration of the Jewish nation offers a satisfactory solution,\r\nif it can be accomplished, of those problems raised by Jewish\r\nemigration, which are otherwise very difficult of adjustment.”\r\n\r\nNaturally, the Palestine Exploration Fund had done a great deal to\r\nkeep alive interest in Palestine among Englishmen; and some at least\r\nof those who worked for it were outspoken supporters of the Jewish\r\nnational idea. Prominent among these is Colonel C. R. Conder, who\r\ndevoted practically the whole of his life to the exploration of the\r\nHoly Land, part of which he surveyed as far back as 1875. He not only\r\nwrote a series of valuable books on Palestine from the standpoint of\r\nthe investigator; he did not fail when opportunity offered to identify\r\nhimself with Zionist views as to the future of the land. He saw in the\r\nZionists the natural leaders to whom the destitute and oppressed Jews\r\nturn for counsel and guidance, and recognized that “a nation without\r\na country must be content with toleration as all that it can expect.”\r\nEnglishmen, he said, should be “only too glad to see Palestine\r\nincreasing in civilization and prosperity as an outpost in the\r\nneighbourhood of Egypt” (Appendix lxxxv).\r\n\r\nFinally, something must be said as to the views put forward by Lord\r\nGwydyr (1841‒1915) with regard to the relations between Jews and Arabs\r\n(Appendix lxxxvi). In suggesting that Palestine can become Jewish\r\nwithout any disadvantage to the Arabs, and that in fact the Jews,\r\nbeing themselves a combination of East and West, are alone capable\r\nof helping the Arabs to take their old place in civilization, Lord\r\nGwydyr is expressing precisely the sentiments of Zionists themselves.\r\nZionism has never desired to use its influence to the disadvantage\r\nof non-Jews in Palestine. Its hope is that there will come a day when\r\neven the Chauvinists among the Arabs, whose number is, happily, quite\r\ninsignificant compared with the noise that they sometimes cause, will\r\nchange their unfriendly policy, and that Jews and Arabs will work\r\ntogether for the civilization of the East.\r\n\r\nIt is true that some English authorities are rather pessimistic as to\r\nthe possibilities of an Arab administration. One of the best-qualified\r\nstudents of the Eastern question says:――\r\n\r\n“Bad as Turkish government is according to our standards, native Arab\r\ngovernment, when not in tutelage to Europeans, has generally proved\r\nitself worse, when tried in the Ottoman area in modern times. Where it\r\nis of a purely Bedouin barbaric type, as in the countries of Central\r\nArabia, it does well enough; but if the population be contaminated\r\never so little with non-Arab elements, practices or ideas, Arab\r\nadministration seems incapable of producing effective government. It\r\nhas had trials in the Holy Cities at intervals, and for longer periods\r\nin the Yemen. But a European, long resident in the latter country, who\r\nhas groaned under Turkish administration, where it has always been the\r\nmost oppressive, bore witness that the rule of the native Imam only\r\nserved to replace oppressive government by oppressive anarchy.”\r\n\r\nThe same author writes concerning the Arab movement:――\r\n\r\n“The peoples of the Arab part of the Ottoman Empire are a congeries of\r\ndiffering races, creeds, sects and social systems, with no common bond\r\nexcept language. The physical character of their land compels a good\r\nthird of them to be nomadic, predatory barbarians, feared by the other\r\ntwo-thirds. The settled folk are divided into Moslem and Christian,\r\nthe cleavage being more abrupt than in Western Turkey, and the\r\ntraditions and actual spirit of mutual enmity more separative. Further,\r\neach of these main divisions is subdivided. Even Islam in this region\r\nincludes a number of incompatible sects, such as the Ansariyeh, the\r\nMatavcle and the Druses in the Syrian mountains; Shiite Arabs on the\r\nGulf Coast and the Persian border.... The ‘Arab Movement’ up to the\r\npresent has consisted of little more than talk and journalistic\r\ncomment.”\r\n\r\nBut we do not take this pessimistic view. We are inclined to give much\r\nmore credit to Arab capacity, and while we admit that the Arab problem\r\nis a serious one, we believe that it can and will be solved.\r\n\r\nAnd as to the alleged rivalry between Jewish and Arab claims we may\r\nquote the opinion of an Arab authority, M. Farid Kassab, as to the\r\nJewish colonization of Palestine:――\r\n\r\n“Nous avons vu de très près les Juifs en Palestine, nous les avons\r\nobservés et nous pouvons tranquilliser l’inquiet Azoury¹ et son Église.\r\nIls ne songent pas à former un empire, à batailler contre les Arabes,\r\nà arracher aux chrétiens un caverne ou un tombeau, devenus pour\r\nquelques-uns l’unique objet du culte, pour d’autres, les fourbes, un\r\nmoyen de vivre dans l’abondance et l’oisivité....\r\n\r\n    ¹ One of the opponents of Zionism.\r\n\r\n“Les Juifs en Orient sont chez eux; cette terre devient leur unique\r\npatrie; ils n’en connaissent pas d’autres.... Ils ne l’exploitent pas\r\ndans l’oisivité pour des intentions absurdes, comme les congrégations\r\ncléricales, ... Ceux-là sont de vrais brigands et de vrais accapareurs\r\navec leurs couvents, leurs hôtelleries et leurs domaines....\r\n\r\n“Si les juifs et les indigènes avec l’aide du gouvernement ottoman\r\nréussissent à rendre à la Palestine un peu de son ancienne splendeur,\r\n... ils recevront néanmoins les remerciements de l’histoire et des\r\ngénération futures.”¹\r\n\r\n    ¹ ♦Le Nouvel Empire Arab et la Curie Romaine et le prétendu\r\n      péril juif universal.

If we review the events in connection with the next Near\r\nEastern crisis, that of 1877‒78, we shall find that the guiding idea\r\nof British policy was the same.\r\n\r\nOn April 24th, 1877, Russia declared war against Turkey. After a war\r\nof eight to nine months, Russia had approached Constantinople. The\r\ntreaty of San Stefano was signed on March 3rd, 1878, but it had to\r\nbe submitted to the European Powers for revision, and to that end the\r\nEuropean Powers met in Congress at Berlin on June 13th, 1878, where\r\nthe whole San Stefano Treaty was to be discussed. Some days before the\r\nCongress met――on the 4th of June――a separate convention was concluded\r\nbetween Great Britain and Turkey, under which Great Britain agreed\r\nfor all time to defend the Asiatic dominions of the Ottoman Empire\r\n“by force of arms,” and in return the Sultan, Abdul Hamid, promised\r\nto introduce all necessary reforms, as agreed upon with his ally, and\r\nto hand over the island of Cyprus for occupation and administration\r\nby England at an annual tribute. This convention with Turkey was one\r\nof the most important measures of foreign policy which have ever been\r\nresolved upon by a British Government. It was a victory, won without\r\nbloodshed by English policy, on the Eastern Question. Cyprus is the\r\nnearest island to the Suez Canal. At that time England had no position\r\nin Egypt close to the Canal itself, and for many reasons the taking\r\nof Egyptian territory was impracticable: hence the possession of\r\nCyprus was attended with special advantages. But the possession of\r\nCyprus could not be dissociated from the pledges given by Turkey and\r\nthe responsibilities taken on by Great Britain with regard to the\r\nAsiatic provinces. It was clear that the Asiatic provinces could\r\nnot be rescued from misrule except by Western agency, and that it\r\nwas necessary for English authority to be on the spot. Cyprus was\r\nconsidered the best station that could be chosen for such a purpose.\r\nThe Porte was expected to develop the vast natural resources of its\r\nAsiatic Empire, or, at least, to allow that task to be accomplished\r\nby others. The Marquess of Salisbury (1830‒1903) made that clear in\r\nwords of undiplomatic plainness when he stated that the protection\r\nof England must depend on the readiness of the Porte “to introduce\r\nthe necessary reform into the government of the Christians and other\r\nsubjects of the Porte.” The Jews no less than the Christians and\r\nthe more enlightened and progressive Mohammedans of the East looked\r\nto England for a sort of political and economic renaissance. The\r\noccupation of Cyprus brought England into the neighbourhood of\r\nPalestine, and made England in the eyes of Zionists the most important\r\nWestern European power in connection with Palestine.\r\n\r\nThe same idea guided British policy with regard to Egypt.\r\n\r\nIn 1882, an early year of Gladstone’s government, Egyptian affairs\r\nwere growing rapidly worse. On June 11th armed revolt broke out\r\nin Alexandria. On July 30th the British Cabinet decided to take\r\naction. The Porte was informed by our Ambassador at Constantinople,\r\nthe Marquess of Dufferin and Ava (1826‒1902), that Great Britain\r\nconsidered that on her was laid the duty of restoring order in\r\nEgypt, and of safeguarding the Suez Canal. The services of a Turkish\r\narmy corps were declined. On August 16th Sir Garnet (afterwards\r\nViscount) Wolseley (1833‒1913) landed at Alexandria, and in September\r\nthe revolt ended. Major Baring (afterwards the Earl of Cromer)\r\n(1841‒1917) was sent to Egypt as British Agent and Consul-General, in\r\norder to assume supreme control of Egyptian foreign and home affairs,\r\nby means of which peace and stability were eventually to be restored\r\nto Egypt, the country was to be freed from external oppression, and\r\ninternal prosperity such as she had not known for many centuries was\r\nto be secured. The real mission of Great Britain was to restore to\r\nEgypt a stable Government, which, like that of India, would lead to\r\na just and wise administration of the country. To pretend that such\r\nan administration could be developed out of the existing conditions,\r\nby giving Egypt a sound constitution by means of the ballot-box, was\r\nto ignore the plainest facts of politics. Egypt’s one chance was to\r\nprocure a strong and permanent protectorate capable of shielding her\r\nfrom rapacious influences from without and from the effects of the\r\npolitical ignorance and weakness wrought within through centuries of\r\nabject servility.\r\n\r\nThus throughout the latter half of the nineteenth century British\r\nstatesmen recognized that the only way to save the near East from\r\ndecay was to bring a stronger and more healthy influence to bear\r\nupon the Turkish Government from without. The idea of a spontaneous\r\nregeneration from within was always held to be inadmissible.\r\n\r\nBut early in the twentieth century events took place which seemed to\r\nindicate that Turkey was going to solve her problems for herself. The\r\nTurkish Revolution, 1908, marked a new epoch.\r\n\r\nThe overthrow of the autocracy and the establishment of constitutional\r\ngovernment in Turkey were greeted with enthusiasm in England,\r\nwhere even the most advanced Radicals, the most voluble preachers\r\nagainst “the unspeakable Turk,” had entirely stopped “their flow\r\nof depreciation.” And on the other side, nothing was so significant\r\nand gratifying during the rejoicings which followed the announcement\r\nof the Constitution in Turkey as the spontaneous demonstrations of\r\nnational enthusiasm for Great Britain. Everybody had long been aware\r\nthat all sections of the Levant populace were filled with friendly\r\nfeelings towards England, and that different races of the Empire\r\nregarded her as their special champion. But in their most sanguine\r\nmoments Englishmen could not have anticipated such impressive\r\ndemonstrations as were witnessed in every quarter of the Turkish\r\ncapital. This friendly feeling was important not only from the\r\npolitical but also from the commercial point of view. For many years\r\npast the extension of British commerce in Turkey had been slow; the\r\nopenings for the development of trade had not been numerous. But under\r\na progressive and friendly Government, bent on setting its house in\r\norder and raising Turkey to the rank of a great Power, such drawbacks\r\nmust immediately disappear.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the cordial relations at first established between\r\nGreat Britain and the new Turkey did not endure. British policy took\r\non a different orientation, and Turkey came under other influences.\r\nOf the more far-reaching effects of this development it is not\r\nwithin our province to speak. But from the Zionist point of view it\r\nwas undoubtedly a great misfortune that Great Britain seemed to be\r\nabandoning her traditional policy of working for the regeneration\r\nof the Near East through the maintenance of friendly relations with\r\nTurkey. For the promise of spontaneous internal reform, which was\r\nheld out for a time by the Turkish revolution, was not fulfilled, and\r\nZionist effort in Palestine, which might have received an enormous\r\nimpetus, was doomed to struggle on against the obstacles imposed by\r\nthe inertia and corruptness of a Turkish Government scarcely differing\r\nfrom the old autocracy except in its greater chauvinism.\r\n\r\nNone the less, it is a fact that the great growth of Palestinian\r\ncommerce which has accompanied the progress of the Jewish settlement\r\nis due mainly to increased trade with the United Kingdom and British\r\npossessions. The Consular Reports (Appendix lxxxvii) show that the\r\nexports from the _Jaffa_ district amounted to £636,000; over £480,000\r\nworth went to England or Egypt. Thus the Jewish colonization movement\r\nhas helped in some degree to advance British commercial interests in\r\nthe Near East.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER LIII.\r\n\r\n                      THE PRINCIPLES OF ZIONISM\r\n\r\n    Palestine as the Homeland――The rebirth of Jewish civilization\r\n    ――The security of public law――The aims of Political Zionism\r\n    ――A modern Commonwealth for the Jewish people.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE are afraid that some readers may feel a certain disappointment at\r\nthe absence in this book of any formulation of what they would call\r\n“definite demands” in respect to Palestine. They may have expected\r\na detailed scheme, showing what political conditions are proposed,\r\nwhether “autonomy” is demanded or certain “privileges,” and so forth.\r\n\r\nThese details are of course very important, and will have to be\r\nconsidered in the near future. But we do not enter into them here\r\nfor several reasons. In the first place, our aim has been mainly\r\nhistorical. We have been concerned with the past, and to some extent\r\nwith the present, and any predictions with regard to the future would\r\nbe out of place. Secondly, the precise nature of the measures that\r\nwill be taken to realize Zionist aims must necessarily depend upon\r\nthe future political position of Palestine. An arrangement that would\r\nsuit one set of circumstances would be quite impossible in another.\r\nIt is, therefore, useless to conjecture anything in advance. And,\r\nthirdly――and this is the most important consideration――the form of the\r\nscheme is, to our mind, a secondary matter. When once the principle\r\nof Zionism is ♦accepted――the principle of _a Homeland for the Jewish\r\npeople_――the adoption of the best means for carrying out its object\r\nwill follow.\r\n\r\n    ♦ “acepted” replaced with “accepted”\r\n\r\nWe do, however, derive from history and experience certain conclusions\r\nas to the way in which the aim of Zionism can be achieved. These\r\nconclusions may be summarized as follows:――\r\n\r\nI. The Homeland of the Jewish people must be in Palestine.\r\n\r\nII. Palestine can and must be made capable of fulfilling its function\r\nby the method of patient colonization.\r\n\r\nIII. The security of public law――that is, of the recognition of the\r\nrightful claim of the Jewish people to regenerate Palestine and itself\r\nthrough Palestine――is a necessary condition of success.\r\n\r\nAs to the first point, experience has sufficiently shown that the Jew\r\nas colonist and as pioneer is at home only in Palestine. More or less\r\nsuccessful attempts at settling Jews on the land have been made in the\r\nArgentine and elsewhere; but none of these settlements has any vital\r\nsignificance for Jewry at large. Their value begins and ends with the\r\nindividuals who take part in them. With the Palestinian settlement\r\nit is quite otherwise. The heart of the Jewish people responds to the\r\nefforts of the Palestinian settlers: it recognizes in them not merely\r\na number of individuals, but its own representatives, the vanguard\r\nof its struggle towards a new life. That is a natural consequence of\r\nthe place which Palestine has held for centuries in the Jewish scheme\r\nof things. Opponents of Zionism have sometimes tried to reconcile\r\nconflicting points of view by admitting that “Palestine is not worse\r\nthan any other country,” and that, therefore, “Jews should not be\r\noppressed there,” and that “if there is a chance for colonization it\r\nshould be taken.” But this is like telling a man that his mother is\r\nno worse than any other woman, or that his language is no worse than\r\nany other language. Such compromises cannot be seriously discussed.\r\nIf Palestine is anything to Jews, it is the Land of _Israel_. But is\r\nPalestine capable of being the Land of _Israel_ in anything but an\r\nideal sense? and if so, how is this to be brought about?\r\n\r\nWe have come to think of Palestine as a barren land; but its apparent\r\nbarrenness is not to be attributed to defects of soil or climate,\r\nas its productivity is in no degree impaired. The causes are the\r\nscantiness of population, lack of industry, skill, ♦initiative\r\nand intelligence, and the want of a local administrative system to\r\nencourage the labour of husbandmen to productive activity. If these\r\nobstacles were removed and a little exertion bestowed upon it the soil\r\nwould soon yield abundant crops of the richest grain, and plantations\r\nof all kinds would flourish; the country still answers the description\r\ngiven of it in days of old. A stronger proof of its fertility cannot\r\nbe adduced than the fact that the territory of Judæa alone, at one\r\nperiod, brought into the field more than three hundred thousand, and\r\nat another two hundred and four score thousand “mighty men of valour”\r\n(2 Chron. xiv. 7). According to Flavius Josephus¹ (37‒95?), Galilee\r\nalone had hundreds of towns and millions of inhabitants. Even if\r\nwe do not accept these as exact figures, there is undoubtedly room\r\nfor several millions of people in Palestine, particularly if the\r\nTrans-_Jordanic_ regions are irrigated, the old roads repaired and the\r\nprojected railway lines constructed. There may be room in the future\r\neven for several millions. The country only awaits repopulation and\r\nreconstruction.\r\n\r\n    ♦ “initative” replaced with “initiative”\r\n\r\n    ¹ Joseph _ben_ Matthias.\r\n\r\nThis work of repopulation and reconstruction has already been begun\r\nby Jews, who have created the nucleus of a flourishing settlement in\r\nPalestine during the last thirty years. All this has to be expanded,\r\nincreased, developed and protected; but the basis is there, and the\r\nlines of progress are sufficiently marked out. This is the way, and\r\nthere is no other. The Zionist Organization, the Baron Edmond _de_\r\nRothschild administration and the _Chovevé Zion_ are competent, by\r\nvirtue of their knowledge and their devotion to the work, to suggest\r\nthe necessary improvements. They alone know how much they have had\r\nto suffer through all kinds of obstacles which impeded and delayed\r\ndevelopment, through the absence of security in consequence of\r\ndisputed title deeds and inability to acquire landed property, through\r\nexorbitant taxes and many other hindrances. Whatever has been done,\r\nin spite of these hindrances, is nothing short of a miracle; and a\r\nhundred times more could be done, and certainly would have been done,\r\nhad there been freedom and security. Given those necessary conditions,\r\nthe Jewish people could find in Palestine a real Homeland, where\r\nit could live according to its own spirit and work out its own\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nNow, the fundamental notion of civilization is that of a progressive\r\nmovement, of a gradual development from the less to the more perfect.\r\nIt suggests to us immediately the greatest activity and the best\r\npossible organization of society, an organization calculated to\r\nproduce a continual increase of wealth and power and their proper\r\ndistribution among its members, so that their condition is kept\r\nin a state of constant improvement. But great as is the influence\r\nwhich a well-organized civil society must have upon the condition\r\nof its members, the term civilization conveys something still more\r\ncomprehensive and more lofty than the mere perfection of social\r\nrelations in the economic sphere. In this other aspect the word\r\nembraces the development of the intellectual and moral faculties of\r\nman, of his feelings, his propensities, his natural capacities and\r\ntastes. Civilization in both aspects has to be worked out by the Jews\r\nin their own way. The rebuilding of a Home in the economic sense is\r\nnot the sole aim of Zionism. Living, national Judaism on historic\r\nlines, expressing and asserting itself throughout the whole range of\r\nhuman life, is the principal object of Zionist effort: to procure for\r\nJewish individuality the possibility of regaining harmony with itself,\r\nand of reaching its highest possible perfection, like any other\r\nnational individuality, is an essential part of the Zionist programme.\r\nIn this sense Zionism means the rebirth of Jewish civilization (or, as\r\nit is frequently termed, “culture”――“Jewish culture”).\r\n\r\nJews are not anxious to acquire military power; they reject and\r\ncondemn the idea of subjugating any other people. On the other hand,\r\nthey have grown tired of their rôle of a homeless Chosen People,\r\nand would prefer to be a self-supporting “small nation,” with a\r\nquiet spot of earth for themselves. They want to be united in an\r\norganic community, to feel entirely at home, with their institutions,\r\ncongregations, societies, settlements, schools and with their national\r\nlanguage, literature and Press. That, neither more nor less, is what\r\nZionists look to as the goal of their efforts.\r\n\r\nThe only serious opposition to a return of the Jews to the Holy\r\nLand――and here we come to our third point――is that which is based\r\nupon the insecurity of political and economic conditions in Palestine.\r\nZionism, therefore, demands improvement in these respects.\r\n\r\nBut how is that improvement to be brought about? The answer is\r\nsupplied by Political Zionism, with its insistence on the security\r\nof public law.\r\n\r\n“Political” Zionism does not mean politics for politics’ sake,\r\nnor does it mean state building as an end in itself. “Political”\r\nZionists know perfectly well that political recognition by itself\r\nis nothing; one has to be on the spot to toil and to labour, to work\r\nout one’s destiny, and without this systematic work all rights are\r\nfutile, all political combinations useless. The Jewish agriculturists,\r\nworking-men, artisans, teachers and artists who have gone to Palestine\r\nto settle there, and those who are still to go, know better than all\r\nthe preachers of Jewish spirituality what the essence of the Jewish\r\ncharacter and aspirations should be and is: they not only know it,\r\nthey help to make it, in the highest sense of the word. They are Jews,\r\nidealists, the People of the Book; all they seek for is life in peace.\r\nWithout practical work in Palestine Zionism would have been one of a\r\nthousand futile political schemes, whereas now it is a solid national\r\nmovement, the colonies being its most powerful argument, even from\r\nthe strictly political point of view. But none the less some guarantee\r\nof security is indispensable. It makes no difference whether we lay\r\nmore stress on culture or agriculture (the various activities have\r\nto be judiciously combined and balanced); in practice the importance\r\nof political and legal securities is too obvious to need particular\r\nemphasis. The reader of this book will have realized that this idea\r\nis no new-fangled invention of Zionism: it has been at the root of\r\nthe attitude of various Governments which for generations have been\r\noccupied with the Near Eastern question. The innumerable schemes\r\nof reform suggested by England, France and other Powers during last\r\ncentury; the English projects of 1840; Great Britain’s protection\r\nof the Jews in the East; Lord Shaftesbury’s proposals; Sir Moses\r\nMontefiore’s negotiations with Mehemet Ali; the “Memorandum of the\r\nEuropean Monarchs” of 1840; the suggestions for reform after the\r\nCrimean War――all these schemes and efforts, suggestions and demands\r\npresupposed the point of view which is expressed in “political”\r\nZionism. The autonomy granted in 1860 to the Christians of the Lebanon,\r\nowing to the efforts of England and France, was a scheme very similar\r\nto that which Zionism contemplates for the Jews in Palestine. The idea\r\nwas much the same as that in the Basle Programme: security, guaranteed\r\nby the Government of the country and other powers, for a successful\r\nsettlement and the free development of a particular section of the\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nThe Jewish settlers in Palestine will have to attach themselves to\r\nthe soil, and to build up the superstructure of a complete settlement\r\nupon the model of their own ideas and spirit. In place of the existing\r\nforty to fifty Jewish colonies, Zionism wants four hundred to five\r\nhundred colonies. In place of the model town _Tel-Aviv_ Zionists want\r\na hundred _Tel-Avivs_. They want as many schools and libraries, a\r\nUniversity and factories and workshops. There is a clever saying:――\r\n\r\n              “_Narrative is linear, action is cubic._”\r\n\r\nHappily, the stage of action has been entered in Palestine; we need\r\nonly action on a larger scale. And for this enlargement and extension\r\nof its activities, for this colonization work which means the\r\nreopening and regeneration of a neglected country, Zionism needs such\r\nspecial facilities and protective measures as the Basle Programme\r\ncontemplates when it speaks of a home for the Jewish people secured\r\nby public law. The formula may be varied, but the sense is abundantly\r\nclear: it means such rights and assurances as will, in existing\r\nconditions, help to lay the foundations of a modern Commonwealth for\r\nthe Jewish people.\r\n\r\nIt has been thought by many that a Chartered Company would be\r\nthe appropriate instrument for achieving this object; others have\r\nthought of concessions to the Zionist Organization and its financial\r\ninstitutions. But these questions of detail matter little at present.\r\nThe _form_ will be decided by general conditions; the _principle_ is\r\na Home secured as far as possible, and behind this again there is the\r\ngreat and profound idea of the reunion of the Jewish Nation with its\r\nnobler self. This idea has obtained currency and spread continually:\r\nit has progressed outwardly and inwardly taken shape, and has\r\ndone more than any other idea to awaken and rekindle the powers\r\nof the Jewish race. It is an impulse of the national soul towards\r\nself-discovery and self-expression, and history testifies to the fact\r\nthat all genuine impulses of this kind have attained their object.\r\n\r\nThe quotations which we have brought together in this book show us\r\nan unbroken chain of opinion that extends over several generations in\r\nEngland and in France. Throughout we observe the same convergence of\r\nideal, practical and political reasons in support of the Zionist idea.\r\nZionism is, indeed, not less practical for being based on sentiment.\r\nEnglishmen have always been practical enough to be idealists, and\r\nit is not surprising that Zionism has always met with the greatest\r\nsympathy in England. This was the case even in the earlier stages\r\nof the Zionist idea, when there was no clear programme and no real\r\nactivity. Now, when Zionism has a clear programme and has years\r\nof activity behind it, English interest in Zionism naturally grows\r\nstronger and deeper.\r\n\r\nZionism has, then, every reason to hope for the sympathy and support\r\nof the most enlightened Powers in its effort to secure the conditions\r\nnecessary for the prosecution of its work in Palestine. But the\r\nachievement of a political success with this or that Power must\r\nnever be mistaken for the real aim of Zionism. Its real aim is the\r\nregeneration――physical, economic, moral――of the Jewish people. That\r\nis a constructive task of the highest value from the point of view of\r\nhumanity, and those who set their hands to such a task need many high\r\nqualities――patience and tenacity of purpose, experience and foresight.\r\nAbove all, they need the gifts of imagination and optimism, without\r\nwhich no great object has ever been achieved. So at last the great day\r\nwill dawn, and the task of Zionism will be accomplished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 INDEX\r\n\r\n         [The Volumes are indicated by I and II respectively.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  Aaronsohn, Aaron, Palestinian agriculturist, I, 287; II, 141\r\n\r\n  Abdallah, Pasha of Acre, I, 73‒4\r\n\r\n  Abdul Aziz, Sultan, I, 171, 186\r\n\r\n  Abdul Hamid, Sultan, I, 259, 303;\r\n    a petition to, I, 231; II, xxxviii, 279‒81\r\n\r\n  Abdul Medjid, Sultan, I, 104, 107, 108, 150, 153, 180\r\n\r\n  Abela, Mr. P., British Vice-Consul, on trade of Haifa, II, 398\r\n\r\n  Aberdeen, Lord, and Sir Moses Montefiore, I, 117‒18\r\n\r\n  Aboab, Rabbi Isaac, I, 44, 45; II, 183‒4\r\n\r\n  Aboo, Samuel, on Palestinian agriculture, I, 115\r\n\r\n  Abrabanel (Dormido), David, I, 16‒17; II, 170 note 1\r\n\r\n  Abrabanel, Don Isaac, I, 18, 24‒6, 45 note; II, 170 note 1\r\n\r\n  Abrabanel, Jona, I, 44 note 5\r\n\r\n  Abrahams, Dr. Israel, II, 67;\r\n    on the British and Foreign Bible Society, II, 218\r\n\r\n  Abrahams, Sir Lionel, II, 67\r\n\r\n  ♦Abramowitsch, S.
