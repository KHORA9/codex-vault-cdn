Perhaps, even more urgently, he\r\nmay have wanted to forestall any British tendency to withdraw\r\nfrom the colony and abandon New South Wales altogether.\r\n\r\nBut as he wrote, he found that he had to make some explanation\r\nfor the defects which he saw in the current life of the colony,\r\nand naturally he was led into propounding some way in which these\r\ndefects could be overcome. Contemporary reviewers, then, were not\r\nso far wrong when theycommented that the book looked almost like\r\ntwo books written by separate hands.\r\n\r\nThe secondary theme became the most important part of the\r\nbook, because the remedies he then proposed for his country's\r\nills became the guidelines for his own policies when he returned\r\nto Australia. Through the influences which he and his friends\r\nexerted over the next thirty years, these policies determined\r\nmuch of the course of Australian history in those times. Most of\r\nhis proposals were eventually accepted, though in some cases much\r\nlater than he wanted, and in some cases with modifications which\r\nhe himself made or which were forced on him by the pressure of\r\nevents.\r\n\r\nAt the time he wrote this book he was in his middle twenties,\r\nhaving returned to England to complete his education soon after\r\nparticipating in the first crossing of the Blue Mountains.\r\nWaterloo had just been won; Europe was settling down and trying\r\nto forget Napoleon. The wounds of the American Revolution were\r\nclosing; British merchants and industrialists were preparing to\r\nchange the face of the world in accordance with the precepts of\r\nAdam Smith.\r\n\r\nIn his attempt to divert the migration stream he was no enemy\r\nof America, (indeed he had chosen the name \"Vermont\" for his own\r\nfarm on the Nepean) but he was perhaps the first Australian\r\nreally to support Macquarie's drive for Australian expansion and\r\nAustralian independence from London administration. He did this\r\nat a time when some influential Englishmen were urging the\r\nabandonment of the whole Botany Bay venture, which, after thirty\r\nyears, was still not self-supporting and which seemed doomed to\r\nsuffer from recurrent crises.\r\n\r\nApparently Macquarie had dreamed of a great transcontinental\r\nriver, which was to flow 2,000 miles westwards from the Dividing\r\nRange, through fertile and well-watered fields, until it reached\r\nthe sea somewhere on the north-west coast. The Lachlan had been\r\nfound to peter out into swamps, but Oxley believed that the\r\nMacquarie River would have a happier issue, and at the time of\r\nthe first Edition of this book (1819) that theory was still\r\ntenable. It was not long, of course, before these hopes were to\r\nperish in the Macquarie Marshes, to be succeeded by prospects of\r\na mythical Inland Sea, though it was decades before the\r\nenthusiasts realised that they would have to be satisfied with\r\nLake Eyre.\r\n\r\nThis first edition accepts as fact the phantom of that\r\ntranscontinental stream and expatiates on the blessings which it\r\nwould bring, patterning its concept of the Heart of the\r\nAustralian Continent upon what was known of the Great Plains of\r\nAmerica, then just being opened up. Any child with an Atlas in\r\nhand can now decry the mistake of having given to this concept\r\nmore credence than did Oxley or Macquarie: does not hindsight\r\nmake history so simple?\r\n\r\nAbandonment of simple optimism on this physical fact must have\r\nbeen quick and uncomfortable: but abandonment of some other\r\nprecepts must have been slow and more painful. At the time of\r\nthis first edition, the influence of the Enlightenment was\r\ncompleting its penetration into politics and economics. Man had\r\nonly to be given freedom, and he would enter into a political\r\nParadise: the forces of the free market had only to be left\r\nuntrammelled, and they would create of themselves an economic\r\nEden!\r\n\r\nThese are the enthusiasms of the first edition, where Bligh\r\nrepresents the forces of repression and darkness, while Macquarie\r\nand Macarthur are both to be numbered among the angels. By the\r\ntime of the third edition (1824, nearly contemporary with the\r\nauthor's return to Australia) the winds of change had blown\r\nthrough the Australian scene. Bigge had presented his Report,\r\nwhich destroyed so much of Macquarie's work, and the Exclusives,\r\nin the author's view, were leagued with enemies of Australian\r\nidentity.\r\n\r\nFor the next thirty years the politics of New South Wales were\r\nvigorous and variegated. Nobody who was at their centre could\r\nhave maintained all his illusions as to the essential goodness of\r\nhuman nature, if only it could be freed from the unnatural chains\r\nwith which society had bound it. Nor could anyone who\r\nparticipated in the commercial life of those times, who had\r\nlived, for example, through the depression of the forties, have\r\npreserved untarnished the precepts of Ricardo--published only a\r\nfew years before 1819, and accepted as gospel in that first\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nSo some of those 1819 enthusiasms had to be abandoned: but the\r\nobjectives were not. Most of them were eventually to be\r\ntranslated into action and actuality. It was in their\r\nmodification, perhaps, that the author was to display most of all\r\nhis foresight and acumen. From 1848 onwards he recognised the\r\ntrue nature of \"the spectre which haunted Europe\"--and which\r\nstill haunts the world. From then onwards he was not to write in\r\nthe way which he wrote here.\r\n\r\nW. C. Wentworth\r\n\r\n24th February, 1978\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\nIt may prevent those inquiries that would be naturally made by\r\nthe public, respecting the manner in which the author acquired\r\nthe information contained in this work, when he states that he\r\nwas born in the colony of New South Wales, and that he resided\r\nthere for about five years since his arrival at the age of\r\nmaturity. This is a period which will, at least, be allowed to\r\nhave been sufficient for acquiring a correct knowledge of its\r\nstate and government, and for enabling him to observe the\r\ndestructive tendency of those measures, of which it has been his\r\nendeavour to demonstrate the injustice and impolicy, and to\r\nprocure the speedy repeal. He would not, however, have it\r\nconcluded that the present work has been the result of mature and\r\nsystematic reflection; it is, on the contrary, a hasty\r\nproduction, which originated in the casual suggestions of an\r\nacquaintance, and which was never contemplated by him, during his\r\nlong residence in the colony. He has consequently been obliged\r\nnot only to omit giving a detail of many interesting facts, with\r\nwhich he might have become acquainted previously to his\r\ndeparture, but has also been under the necessity of relying in a\r\ngreat measure on the fidelity of his memory for the accuracy of\r\nmany of those circumstances which he has stated: still he is not\r\nwithout hope, that five years attentive observation will have\r\nenabled him to communicate many particulars, of which, in the\r\nabsence of abler works on the same subject, most of the\r\ninhabitants of this country cannot but be ignorant, and many must\r\nwish to be apprized.\r\n\r\nHis only aim in obtruding this hasty production on the public,\r\nis to promote the welfare and prosperity of the country which\r\ngave him birth; and he has judged that he could in no way so\r\neffectually contribute his mite towards the accomplishment of\r\nthis end, as by attempting to divert from the United States of\r\nAmerica to its shores, some part of that vast tide of emigration,\r\nwhich is at present flowing thither from all parts of Europe. In\r\nfurtherance, therefore, of this design, he has described the\r\nsuperior advantages of climate and soil possessed by this colony;\r\nhe has explained the causes why these natural superiorities have\r\nnot yet been productive of those beneficial consequences which\r\nmight have been expected from them; he has pointed out the\r\narguments which offer for the abandonment of the present system,\r\nand the substitution of another in its place; and by adducing, in\r\nfine, what he considers to be irrefragable proofs of the\r\nexpediency, merely as it regards the parent country, of adopting\r\nthe measures which he has proposed, he hopes that he shall\r\neventually occasion an alteration of polity, by which both the\r\nparties concerned will be equally benefited. He has not, however,\r\npresumed on a contingency which it is thus reasonable to believe\r\ncannot be either doubtful or remote; but has restricted\r\nhimself to an enumeration of the inducements to emigration which\r\nexist under actual circumstances; and, by comparing them with the\r\nadvantages which those writers, who have given the most\r\nfavourable accounts of the United States, have represented them\r\nas possessing, he has proved that this colony, labouring as it is\r\nunder all the discouragements of an arbitrary and impolitic\r\ngovernment, has still a great and decided preponderancy in the\r\nbalance. How much this preponderancy will be increased, whenever\r\nthe changes and modifications which he has ventured to suggest,\r\nshall be in whole, or in part carried into effect, he has left to\r\nall such as are desirous of emigrating, to form their own\r\nestimate; and to decide also how much longer a system so highly\r\nburdensome to the parent country, and so radically defective in\r\nits principles and operation, is likely to be tolerated. To all\r\nthose, who are of opinion with him that it cannot be of much\r\nlonger duration, the inducements for giving this colony the\r\npreference will become so weighty, as scarcely to admit of the\r\npossibility that they should hesitate for a moment in their\r\nchoice between the two countries.\r\n\r\nIf, in the course of this work, he has spoken in terms of\r\nunqualified reprobation of the baneful system to which the\r\nunhappy place of his nativity has been the victim, he would have\r\nit distinctly understood, that it has been furthest from his\r\nthoughts to connect the censure which he has bestowed on it, with\r\nthose who have permitted its continuance. He is too deeply\r\nimpressed with a sense of the arduous and momentous nature of the\r\ncontest which they have had to conduct, not to allow that it was\r\njustly entitled to their first and chief attention. Our whole\r\ncolonial system, in fact, he considers to have been but a mere\r\nunder plot in the great drama that was acting. It could not,\r\ntherefore, be reasonably expected that the grievances of any one\r\ncolony should become the subject of minute and particular\r\ninvestigation; and still less could it be imagined that the\r\ngovernment should convert their attention to the relief of one,\r\nwhich has comparatively excited but a small share of public\r\ninterest, and has hitherto been considered more in the light of a\r\nprison, than of what he has endeavoured to prove it might be\r\nrendered,--one of the most useful and valuable appendages of the\r\nempire. This apology, however, for the neglect which the colony\r\nhas experienced during the war, cannot be pleaded in vindication\r\nof a perseverance in the same impolitic and oppressive course in\r\ntime of peace. Nor is it to be wondered at, as upwards of three\r\nyears have now elapsed since the consolidation of the\r\ntranquillity of the world, that the colonists should begin to\r\nfeel indignant at the continuance of disabilities, for the\r\nabrogation of which the most powerful considerations of justice\r\nand expediency have been urged in vain. To remove such just\r\ngrounds for dissatisfaction and complaint, and to allow them, at\r\nlength, the enjoyment of those rights and privileges, of which\r\nthey ought never to have been debarred, would, at best, be but a\r\npoor compensation for an impeded agriculture and languishing\r\ncommerce; but it is the only one that can now be offered; and,\r\nalthough it cannot repair the wide ravages which so many years of\r\nunmerited and absurd restrictions have occasioned, it may arrest\r\nthe progress of desolation, and prevent any further increase to\r\nthe numbers who have already sunk beneath the pressure of an\r\noverwhelming system. It is, therefore, to be hoped that the cause\r\nof humanity will no longer be outraged by unnecessary delay, and\r\nthat the only atonement, which can be made the colonists for\r\ntheir past and present sufferings, will no longer be\r\nwithheld.\r\n\r\nThe author is fully aware that, in the course of this work, he\r\nhas developed no new principle of political economy, and that he\r\nhas only travelled in the broad beaten path in which hundreds\r\nhave journeyed before him. For troubling, therefore, the public\r\nwith a repetition of principles, of which the truth is so\r\ngenerally known and acknowledged, the only plea he can urge in\r\nhis justification is a hope that the reiteration of them will not\r\nbe deemed unnecessary and obtrusive, so long as their application\r\nis incomplete; so long as vice and misery prevail in any part of\r\nthe world, from the want of their adoption and enforcement.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nPART I\r\n\r\nNEW SOUTH WALES.\r\n\r\nSTATISTICAL ACCOUNT OF THE SETTLEMENTS IN NEW HOLLAND.\r\n\r\nThe colony of New South Wales is situated on the eastern coast\r\nof New Holland. This island, which was first discovered by the\r\nDutch in 1616, lies between the 9 degrees and 39 degrees of south\r\nlatitude, and the 108 degrees and 153 degrees of east longitude;\r\nand from its immense size, seems rather to merit the appellation\r\nof continent, which many geographers have bestowed on it. Since\r\nthat period it has been visited and examined by a galaxy of\r\ncelebrated navigators, among whom Cook and Flinders rank the most\r\nconspicuous. Still the survey of this large portion of the world\r\ncannot, by any means, be deemed complete; since not one of all\r\nthe navigators who have laid down the various parts of its\r\ncoasts, has discovered the mouth of any considerable river; and\r\nit is hardly within the scope of possible belief, that a country\r\nof such vast extent does not possess at least one river, which\r\nmay deserve to be ranked in the class of \"rivers of the first\r\nmagnitude.\"\r\n\r\nIf a judgment were formed of this island from the general\r\naspect of the country bordering the sea, it would be pronounced\r\none of the most barren spots on the face of the globe.\r\nExperience, however, has proved that such an opinion would be\r\nexactly the reverse of truth; since, as far as the interior has\r\nbeen explored, its general fertility amply compensates for the\r\nextreme sterility of the coast.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of this country is covered with timber of a\r\ngigantic growth, but of an entirely different description from\r\nthe timber of Europe. It is, however, very durable, and well\r\nadapted to all the purposes of human industry.\r\n\r\nThe only metal yet discovered is iron. It abounds in every\r\npart of the country, and is in some places purer than in any\r\nother part of the world. Coals are found in many places of the\r\nbest quality. There is also abundance of slate, limestone and\r\ngranite, though not in the immediate vicinity of Port Jackson.\r\nSand-stone, quartz, and freestone are found every where.\r\n\r\nThe rivers and seas teem with excellent fish; but the eel and\r\nsmelt, the mullet, whiting, mackarel, sole, skate, and John Dory\r\nare, I believe, the only sorts known in this country.\r\n\r\nThe animals are, the kangaroo, native dog, (which is a smaller\r\nspecies of the wolf,) the wombat, bandicoot, kangaroo rat,\r\nopossum, flying squirrel, flying fox, etc. etc. There are none of\r\nthose animals or birds which go by the name of \"game\" in this\r\ncountry, except the heron. The hare, pheasant and partridge are\r\nquite unknown; but there are wild ducks, widgeon, teal, quail,\r\npigeons, plovers, snipes, etc. etc., with emus, black swans,\r\ncockatoos, parrots, parroquets, and an infinite variety of\r\nsmaller birds, which are not found in any other country. In fact,\r\nboth its animal and vegetable kingdoms are in a great measure\r\npeculiar to itself.\r\n\r\nThere are many poisonous reptiles in this country, but few\r\naccidents happen either to the aborigines, or the colonists from\r\ntheir bite. Of these the centipede, tarantula, scorpion,\r\nslow-worm, and the snake, are the most to be dreaded;\r\nparticularly the latter, since there are, I believe, at least\r\nthirty varieties of them, of which all but one are venomous in\r\nthe highest degree.\r\n\r\nThe aborigines of this country occupy the lowest place in the\r\ngradatory scale of the human species. They have neither houses\r\nnor clothing; they are entirely unacquainted with the arts of\r\nagriculture; and even the arms which the several tribes have, to\r\nprotect themselves from the aggressions of their neighbours, and\r\nthe hunting and fishing implements with which they administer to\r\ntheir support, are of the rudest contrivance and workmanship.\r\n\r\nThirty years intercourse with Europeans has not effected the\r\nslightest change in their habits; and even those who have most\r\nintermixed with the colonists, have never been prevailed upon to\r\npractise one of the arts of civilized life. Disdaining all\r\nrestraint, their happiness is still centered in their original\r\npursuits; and they seem to consider the superior enjoyments to be\r\nderived from civilization, (for they are very far from being\r\ninsensible to them) but a poor compensation for the sacrifice of\r\nany portion of their natural liberty. The colour of these people\r\nis a dark chocolate; their features bear a strong resemblance to\r\nthe African negro; they have the same flat nose, large nostrils,\r\nwide mouth and thick lips; but their hair is not woolly, except\r\nin Van Dieman's Land, where they have this further characteristic\r\nof the negro.\r\n\r\nThese people bear no resemblance to any of the inhabitants of\r\nthe surrounding islands, except to those of New Guinea, which is\r\nonly separated from New Holland by a narrow strait. One of these\r\nislands, therefore, has evidently been peopled by the other; but\r\nfrom whence the original stock was derived is one of those\r\ngeographical problems, which in all probability will never be\r\nsatisfactorily solved.\r\n\r\nRude and barbarous as are the aborigines of this country, they\r\nhave still some confused notions of a Supreme Being and of a\r\nfuture state. It would, however, be foreign to the purposes to\r\nwhich I have limited myself, to enter into a detail of their\r\ncustoms and manners; nor would it, indeed, be the means of\r\nincreasing the fund of public knowledge: since, whoever may be\r\nanxious to be informed on these topics, will find a faithful and\r\nminute account of them in the work of Mr. Collins.\r\n\r\nSydney, the capital of New South Wales, is situated in 33\r\ndegrees 55' of south latitude, and 151 degrees 25' of east\r\nlongitude. It is about seven miles distant from the heads of Port\r\nJackson, and stands principally on two hilly necks of land and\r\nthe intervening valley, which together form Sydney Cove. The\r\nwestern side of the town extends to the water's edge, and\r\noccupies with the exception of the small space reserved around\r\nDawe's Battery, the whole of the neck of land which separates\r\nSydney Cove from Lane Cove, and extends a considerable distance\r\nback into the country besides.\r\n\r\nThis part of the town, it may therefore be perceived, forms a\r\nlittle peninsula; and what is of still greater importance the\r\nwater is in general of sufficient depth in both these coves, to\r\nallow the approach of vessels of the largest burden to the very\r\nsides of the rocks.\r\n\r\nOn the eastern neck of land, the extension of the town has\r\nbeen stopped by the Government House, and the adjoining domain,\r\nwhich occupies the whole of Bennilong's Point, a circumstance the\r\nmore to be regretted, as the water all along this point is of\r\nstill greater depth than on the western side of the Cove, and\r\nconsequently affords still greater facilities for the erection of\r\nwarehouses and the various important purposes of commerce.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the town is rude and irregular. Until the\r\nadministration of Governor Macquarie, little or no attention had\r\nbeen paid to the laying out of the streets, and each proprietor\r\nwas left to build on his lease, where and how his caprice\r\ninclined him. He, however, has at length succeeded in\r\nestablishing a perfect regularity in most of the streets, and has\r\nreduced to a degree of uniformity, that would have been deemed\r\nabsolutely impracticable, even the most confused portion of that\r\nchaos of building, which is still known by the name of \"the\r\nrocks;\" and which, from the ruggedness of its surface, the\r\ndifficulty of access to it, and the total absence of order in its\r\nhouses, was for many years more like the abode of a horde of\r\nsavages than the residence of a civilized community. The town\r\nupon the whole may be now pronounced to be tolerably regular;\r\nand, as in all future additions that may be made to it, the\r\nproprietors of leases will not be allowed to deviate from the\r\nlines marked out by the surveyor general, the new part will of\r\ncourse be free from the faults and inconveniences of the old.\r\n\r\nThis town covers a considerable extent of ground, and would at\r\nfirst sight induce the belief of a much greater population than\r\nit actually contains. This is attributable to two circumstances,\r\nthe largeness of the leases, which in most instances possess\r\nsufficient space for a garden, and the smallness of the houses\r\nerected in them, which in general do not exceed one story. From\r\nthese two causes it happens, that this town does not contain\r\nabove seven thousand souls, whereas one that covered the same\r\nextent of ground in this country would possess a population of at\r\nleast twenty thousand. But although the houses are for the most\r\npart small, and of mean appearance, there are many public\r\nbuildings, as well as houses of individuals, which would not\r\ndisgrace the best parts of this great metropolis. Of the former\r\nclass, the public stores, the general hospital, and the barracks,\r\nare perhaps the most conspicuous; of the latter the houses of\r\nMessrs. Lord, Riley, Howe, Underwood and Nichols.\r\n\r\nThe value of land in this town is in many places half as great\r\nas in the best situations in London, and is daily increasing.\r\nRents are in consequence exorbitantly high. It is very far from a\r\ncommodious house that can be had for a hundred a year,\r\nunfurnished.\r\n\r\nHere is a very good market, although it is of very recent\r\ndate. It was established by Governor Macquarie, in the year 1813,\r\nand is very well supplied with grain, vegetables, poultry,\r\nbutter, eggs and fruit. It is, however, only held three times a\r\nweek; viz. on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. It is a large\r\noblong enclosure, and there are stores erected in it by the\r\nGovernor, for the reception of all such provisions as remain\r\nunsold at the close of the market, which lasts from six o'clock\r\nin the morning in summer, and seven o'clock in winter, until\r\nthree o'clock in the evening. The vender pays in return a small\r\nduty to the clerk of the market, who accounts quarterly for the\r\namount to the treasurer of the police fund. The annual amount of\r\nthese duties is about £130.*\r\n\r\n[* Vide Market Duties in the Appendix.]\r\n\r\nHere also is a Bank, called \"The Bank of New South Wales,\"\r\nwhich was established in the year 1817, and promises to be of\r\ngreat and permanent benefit to the colony in general. Its capital\r\nis £20,000, divided into two hundred shares. It has a\r\nregular charter of incorporation, and is under the controul of a\r\npresident* and six directors, who are annually chosen by the\r\nproprietors. The paper of this bank is now the principal\r\ncirculating medium of this colony. They discount bills of a short\r\ndate, and also advance money on mortgage securities. They are\r\nallowed to receive in return an interest of 10 per cent. per\r\nannum.\r\n\r\n[* See Appendix.]\r\n\r\nThis town also contains two very good public schools, for the\r\neducation of children of both sexes. One is a day school for\r\nboys, and is of course only intended to impart gratuitous\r\ninstruction:--the other is designed both for the education and\r\nsupport of poor and helpless female orphans. This institution was\r\nfounded by Governor King, as long back as the year 1800, and\r\ncontains about sixty children, who are taught reading, writing,\r\narithmetic, sewing, and the various arts of domestic economy.\r\nWhen their education is complete, they are either married to free\r\npersons of good character, or are assigned as servants to such\r\nrespectable families as may apply for them. At the time of the\r\nestablishment of this school there was a large tract of land\r\n(15,000 acres,) attached to it; and a considerable stock of\r\nhorses, cattle, and sheep, were also transferred to it from the\r\ngovernment herds. The profits of these stock go towards defraying\r\nthe expences of this school, and a certain portion, fifty or a\r\nhundred acres of this land, with a proportionate number of them,\r\nare given in dower with each female who marries with the consent\r\nof the committee intrusted with the management of this\r\ninstitution.\r\n\r\nBesides these two public schools in the town of Sydney, which\r\ntogether contained, by the last accounts received from the\r\ncolony, two hundred and twenty-four children, there are\r\nestablishments for the gratuitous diffusion of education in every\r\npopulous district throughout the colony. The masters of these\r\nschools are allowed stipulated salaries from the Orphan Fund.\r\nFormerly particular duties, those on coals and timber, which\r\nstill go by the name of \"The Orphan Dues,\" were allotted for the\r\nsupport of these schools; but they were found to be insufficient,\r\nand afterwards one-fourth, and more recently one-eighth, of the\r\nwhole revenue of the colony was appropriated to this purpose.\r\nThis latter portion of the colonial revenue may be estimated at\r\nabout £2500, which it must be admitted could not be devoted\r\nto the promotion of any object of equal public utility.\r\n\r\nIndependent of these laudable institutions thus supported at\r\nthe expence of the government, there are two private ones\r\nintended for the dissemination of religious knowledge, which are\r\nwholly maintained by voluntary contribution. One is termed \"The\r\nAuxiliary Bible Society of New South Wales,\" and its object is to\r\ncooperate with the British and Foreign Bible Society, and to\r\ndistribute the holy Scriptures either at prime cost, or gratis,\r\nto needy and deserving applicants.\r\n\r\nThe other is called \"The New South Wales Sunday School\r\nInstitution,\" and was established with a view to teach well\r\ndisposed persons of all ages how to read the sacred volume. These\r\nsocieties were instituted in the year 1817, and are under the\r\ndirection of a general committee, aided by a secretary and\r\ntreasurer.\r\n\r\nThere are in this town and other parts of the colony, several\r\ngood private seminaries for the board and education of the\r\nchildren of opulent parents. The best is in the district of\r\nCastlereagh, which is about forty miles distant, and is kept by\r\nthe clergyman of that district, the Rev. Henry Fulton, a\r\ngentleman peculiarly qualified both from his character and\r\nacquirements for conducting so responsible and important an\r\nundertaking. The boys in this seminary receive a regular\r\nclassical education, and the terms are as reasonable as those of\r\nsimilar establishments in this country.\r\n\r\nThe harbour of Port Jackson is perhaps exceeded by none in the\r\nworld except the Derwent in point of size and safety; and in this\r\nlatter particular, I rather think it has the advantage. It is\r\nnavigable for vessels of any burden for about seven miles above\r\nthe town, i.e. about fifteen from the entrance. It possesses the\r\nbest anchorage the whole way, and is perfectly sheltered from\r\nevery wind that can blow. It is said, and I believe with truth,\r\nto have a hundred coves, and is capable of containing all the\r\nshipping in the world. There can be no doubt, therefore, that in\r\nthe course of a few years, the town of Sydney, from the\r\nexcellence of its situation alone, must become a place of\r\nconsiderable importance.\r\n\r\nThe views from the heights of the town are bold, varied and\r\nbeautiful. The strange irregular appearance of the town itself,\r\nthe numerous coves and islets both above and below it, the\r\ntowering forests and projecting rocks, combined with the infinite\r\ndiversity of hill and dale on each side of the harbour, form\r\naltogether a coup d'oeil, of which it may be safely asserted that\r\nfew towns can boast a parallel.\r\n\r\nThe neighbouring scenery is still more diversified and\r\nromantic, particularly the different prospects which open upon\r\nyou from the hills on the south head road, immediately contiguous\r\nto the town. Looking towards the coast you behold at one glance\r\nthe greater part of the numerous bays and islands which lie\r\nbetween the town and the heads, with the succession of barren,\r\nbut bold and commanding hills, that bound the harbour, and are\r\nabruptly terminated by the water. Further north, the eye ranges\r\nover the long chain of lofty rugged cliffs that stretch away in\r\nthe direction of the coal river, and distinctly mark the bearing\r\nof the coast, until they are lost in the dimness of vision.\r\nWheeling round to the south you behold at the distance of seven\r\nor eight miles, that spacious though less eligible harbour,\r\ncalled \"Botany Bay,\" from the prodigious variety of new plants\r\nwhich Sir Joseph Banks found in its vicinity, when it was first\r\ndiscovered and surveyed by Captain Cook. To the southward again\r\nof this magnificent sheet of water, where it will be recollected\r\nit was the original intention, though afterwards judiciously\r\nabandoned, to found the capital of this colony, you behold the\r\nhigh bluff range of hills that stretch away towards the five\r\nislands, and likewise indicate the trending of the coast in that\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nIf you afterwards suddenly face about to the westward, you see\r\nbefore you one vast forest, uninterrupted except by the\r\ncultivated openings which have been made by the axe on the\r\nsummits of some of the loftiest hills, and which tend\r\nconsiderably to diminish those melancholy sensations its gloomy\r\nmonotony would otherwise inspire. The innumerable undulations in\r\nthis vast expanse of forest, forcibly remind you of the ocean\r\nwhen convulsed by tempests; save that the billows of the one\r\nslumber in a fixed and leaden stillness, and want that motion\r\nwhich constitutes the diversity, beauty, and sublimity of the\r\nother. Continuing the view, you arrive at that majestic and\r\ncommanding chain of mountains called \"the Blue Mountains,\" whose\r\nstately and o'ertopping grandeur forms a most imposing boundary\r\nto the prospective.\r\n\r\nIf you proceed on the south head road, until you arrive at the\r\neminence called \"Belle Vue,\" the scenery is still more\r\npicturesque and grand; since, in addition to the striking objects\r\nalready described, you behold, as it were at your feet, although\r\nstill more than a mile distant from you, the vast and foaming\r\nPacific. In boisterous weather the surges that break in mountains\r\non the shore beneath you, form a sublime contrast to the still,\r\nplacid waters of the harbour, which in this spot is only\r\nseparated from the sea by a low sandy neck of land not more than\r\nhalf a mile in breadth; yet is so completely sheltered, that no\r\ntempests can ruffle its tranquil surface.\r\n\r\nThe town of Parramatta is situated at the head of Port Jackson\r\nHarbour, at the distance of about eighteen miles by water, and\r\nfifteen by land, from Sydney. The river for the last seven or\r\neight miles, is only navigable for boats of twelve or fifteen\r\ntons burden. This town is built along a small fresh water stream,\r\nwhich falls into the river. It consists principally of one street\r\nabout a mile in length. It is surrounded on the south side by a\r\nchain of moderately high hills; and as you approach it by the\r\nSydney road, it breaks suddenly on the view when you have reached\r\nthe summit of them, and produces a very pleasing effect. The\r\nadjacent country has been a good deal cleared; and the gay\r\nmimosas, which have sprung up in the openings, form a very\r\nagreeable contrast to the dismal gloom of the forest that\r\nsurrounds and o'ertops them.\r\n\r\nThe town itself is far behind Sydney in respect of its\r\nbuildings; but it nevertheless contains many of a good and\r\nsubstantial construction. These, with the church, the government\r\nhouse, the new Orphan House, and some gentlemen's seats, which\r\nare situated on the surrounding eminences, give it, upon the\r\nwhole, a very respectable appearance. There are two very good\r\ninns, where a traveller may meet with all the comfort and\r\naccommodation that are to be found in similar establishments in\r\nthe country towns of this kingdom. The charges too are by no\r\nmeans unreasonable.\r\n\r\nThe population is principally composed of inferior traders,\r\npublicans, artificers, and labourers, and may be estimated,\r\ninclusive of a company which is always stationed there, on a\r\nrough calculation, at about twelve hundred souls.\r\n\r\nThere are two fairs held half yearly, one in March and the\r\nother in September; they were instituted about five years since\r\nby the present governor, and already begin to be very numerously\r\nand respectably attended. They are chiefly intended for the sale\r\nof stock, for which there are stalls, pens, and every other\r\nconvenience, erected at the expence of the government; for the\r\nuse of these pens, etc. and to keep them in repair, a moderate\r\nscale of duties* is paid by the vender.\r\n\r\nThis town has for many years past made but a very\r\ninconsiderable progress compared with Sydney. The value of land\r\nhas consequently not kept pace in the two places, and is at least\r\n£200 per cent. less in the one than in the other. As the\r\nformer, however, is in a central situation between the rapidly\r\nincreasing settlements on the banks of the Hawkesbury and Nepean\r\nrivers, and the latter the great mart for colonial produce,\r\nlanded property there and in the neighbourhood, will, without\r\ndoubt, experience a gradual rise.\r\n\r\nThe public institutions are an Hospital, a Female Orphan\r\nHouse, into which it is intended to remove the orphans from\r\nSydney, and a factory, in which such of the female convicts as\r\nmisconduct themselves, and those also who upon their arrival in\r\nthe colony are not immediately assigned as servants to families,\r\nare employed in manufacturing coarse cloth. There are upon an\r\naverage about one hundred and sixty women employed in this\r\ninstitution, which is placed under the direction of a\r\nsuperintendant, who receives wool from the settlers, and gives\r\nthem a certain portion of the manufactured article in exchange:\r\nwhat is reserved is only a fair equivalent for the expence of\r\nmaking it, and is used in clothing the gaol gang, the reconvicted\r\nculprits who are sent to the coal river, and I believe the\r\ninmates of the factory itself.\r\n\r\nThere is also another public institution in this town, well\r\nworthy the notice of the philanthropist. It is a school for the\r\neducation and civilization of the aborigines of the country. It\r\nwas founded by the present governor three years since, and by the\r\nlast accounts from the colony, it contained eighteen native\r\nchildren, who had been voluntarily placed there by their parents,\r\nand were making equal progress in their studies with European\r\nchildren of the same age. The following extract from the Sydney\r\nGazette, of January 4, 1817, may enable the reader to form some\r\nopinion of the beneficial consequences that are likely to result\r\nfrom this institution, and how far they may realize the\r\nbenevolent intentions which actuated its philanthropic\r\nfounder.\r\n\r\n\"On Saturday last, the 28th ult. the town of Parramatta\r\nexhibited a novel and very interesting spectacle, by the\r\nassembling of the native tribes there, pursuant to the governor's\r\ngracious invitation. At ten in the morning the market place was\r\nthrown open, and some gentlemen who were appointed on the\r\noccasion, took the management of the ceremonials. The natives\r\nhaving seated themselves on the ground in a large circle, the\r\nchiefs were placed on chairs a little advanced in front, and to\r\nthe right of their respective tribes. In the centre of the circle\r\nthus formed, were placed large tables groaning under the weight\r\nof roast beef, potatoes, bread, etc. and a large cask of grog\r\nlent its exhilarating aid to promote the general festivity and\r\ngood humour which so conspicuously shone through the sable\r\nvisages of this delighted congress. The governor, attended by all\r\nthe members* of the native institution, and by several of the\r\nmagistrates and gentlemen in the neighbourhood, proceeded at half\r\npast ten to the meeting, and having entered the circle, passed\r\nround the whole of them, inquiring after, and making himself\r\nacquainted with the several tribes, their respective leaders and\r\nresidences. His Excellency then assembled the chiefs by\r\nthemselves, and confirmed them in the ranks of chieftains, to\r\nwhich their own tribes had exalted them, and conferred upon them\r\nbadges of distinction; whereon were engraved their names as\r\nchiefs, and those of their tribes. He afterwards conferred badges\r\nof merit on some individuals, in acknowledgment of their steady\r\nand loyal conduct in the assistance they rendered the military\r\nparty, when lately sent out in pursuit of the refractory natives\r\nto the west and south of the Nepean river. By the time this\r\nceremony was over, Mrs. Macquarie arrived, and the children\r\nbelonging to, and under the care of the native institution,\r\nfifteen in number, preceded by their teacher, entered the circle,\r\nand walked round it; the children appearing very clean, well\r\nclothed and happy. The chiefs were then again called together to\r\nobserve the examination of the children as to their progress in\r\nlearning and the civilized habits of life. Several of the little\r\nones read; and it was grateful to the bosom of sensibility to\r\ntrace the degrees of pleasure which the chiefs manifested on this\r\noccasion. Some clapped the children on the head; and one in\r\nparticular turning round towards the governor with extraordinary\r\nemotion, exclaimed, Governor, that will make a good\r\nsettler,--that's my Pickaninny! (meaning his child). And some of\r\nthe females were observed to shed tears of sympathetic affection,\r\nat seeing the infant and helpless off-spring of their deceased\r\nfriends, so happily sheltered and protected by British\r\nbenevolence. The examinations being finished, the children\r\nreturned to the institution, under the guidance of their\r\nvenerable tutor; whose assiduity and attention to them, merit\r\nevery commendation\".\r\n\r\n[* Appendix]\r\n\r\n\"The feasting then commenced, and the governor retired amidst\r\nthe long and reiterated acclamations and shouts of his sable and\r\ngrateful congress. The number of the visitants, (exclusive of the\r\nfifteen children) amounted to one hundred and seventy-nine, viz.\r\none hundred and five men, fifty-three women, and twenty-one\r\nchildren. It is worthy of observation that three of the latter\r\nmentioned number of children, (and the son of the memorable\r\nBemni-long, was one of them) were placed in the native\r\ninstitution, immediately after the breaking up of the congress,\r\non Saturday last, making the number of children now in that\r\nestablishment, altogether eighteen; and we may reasonably trust\r\nthat in a few years this benevolent institution will amply reward\r\nthe hopes and expectations of its liberal patrons and supporters,\r\nand answer the grand object intended, by providing a seminary for\r\nthe helpless off-spring of the natives of this country, and\r\nopening the path to their future civilization and\r\nimprovement.\"\r\n\r\nWINDSOR.\r\n\r\nThe town of Windsor, (or as it was formerly called, the Green\r\nHills), is thirty-five miles distant from Sydney, and is situated\r\nnear the confluence of the South Creek with the river Hawkesbury.\r\nIt stands on a hill, whose elevation is about one hundred feet\r\nabove the level of the river, at low water. The buildings here\r\nare much of the same cast as at Parramatta, being in general\r\nweather boarded without, and lathed and plastered within.\r\n\r\nThe public buildings are a church, government house, hospital,\r\nbarracks, court-house, store-house, and gaol, none of which are\r\nworthy of notice. The inn lately established by Mr. Fitzgerald,\r\nis by far the best building in the town, and may be pronounced\r\nupon the whole, the most splendid establishment of the kind in\r\nthe colony.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of the population is composed of settlers, who have\r\nfarms in the neighbourhood, and of their servants. There are\r\nbesides a few inferior traders, publicans and artificers. The\r\ntown contains in the whole about six hundred souls.\r\n\r\nThe Hawkesbury here is of considerable size, and navigable for\r\nvessels of one hundred tons burden, for about four miles above\r\nthe town. A little higher up, it is joined by, or rather is\r\ncalled the Nepean river, and has several shallows; but with the\r\nhelp of two or three ferries, it might still be rendered\r\nnavigable for boats of twelve or fifteen tons burden, for about\r\ntwenty miles further. This substitution of water for land\r\ncarriage, would be of great advantage to the numerous settlers\r\nwho inhabit its highly fertile banks, and would also considerably\r\npromote the extension of agriculture throughout the adjacent\r\ndistricts.\r\n\r\nFollowing the sinuosities of the river the distance of Windsor\r\nfrom the sea is about one hundred and forty miles; whereas in a\r\nstraight line it is not more than thirty-five. The rise of the\r\ntide is about four feet, and the water is fresh for forty miles\r\nbelow the town.\r\n\r\nLand is about ten per cent. higher than at Parramatta, and is\r\nadvancing rapidly in price. This circumstance is chiefly\r\nattributable to the small quantity of land that is to be had\r\nperfectly free from the reach of the inundations, to which the\r\nHawkesbury is so frequently subject. These inundations often rise\r\nseventy or eighty feet above low water mark; and in the instance\r\nof what is still emphatically termed \"the great flood,\" attained\r\nan elevation of ninety-three feet. The chaos of confusion and\r\ndistress that presents itself on these occasions, cannot be\r\neasily conceived by any one who has not been a witness of its\r\nhorrors. An immense expanse of water, of which the eye cannot in\r\nmany directions discover the limits, every where interspersed\r\nwith growing timber, and crowded with poultry, pigs, horses,\r\ncattle, stacks and houses, having frequently men, women, and\r\nchildren, clinging to them for protection, and shrieking out in\r\nan agony of despair for assistance:--such are the principal\r\nobjects by which these scenes of death and devastation are\r\ncharacterized.\r\n\r\nThese inundations are not periodical, but they most generally\r\nhappen in the month of March. Within the last two years there\r\nhave been no fewer than four of them, one of which was nearly as\r\nhigh as the great flood. In the six years precedings there had\r\nnot been one. Since the establishment of the colony they have\r\nhappened upon an average, about once in three years.\r\n\r\nThe principal cause of them is the contiguity of this river to\r\nthe Blue Mountains. The Grose and Warraganbia rivers, from which\r\ntwo sources it derives its principal supply, issue direct from\r\nthese mountains; and the Nepean river, the other principal branch\r\nof it, runs along the base of them for fifty or sixty miles; and\r\nreceives in its progress, from the innumerable mountain torrents\r\nconnected with it, the whole of the rain which these mountains\r\ncollect in that great extent. That this is the principal cause of\r\nthese calamitous inundations has been fully proved; for shortly\r\nafter the plantation of this colony, the Hawkesbury overflowed\r\nits banks, (which are in general about thirty feet in height), in\r\nthe midst of harvest, when not a single drop of rain had fallen\r\non the Port Jackson side of the mountains. Another great cause of\r\nthe inundations, which take place in this and the other rivers in\r\nthe colony, is the small fall that is in them, and the consequent\r\nslowness of their currents. The current in the Hawkesbury, even\r\nwhen the tide is in full ebb, does not exceed two miles an hour.\r\nThe water, therefore, which during the rains, rushes in torrents\r\nfrom the mountains cannot escape with sufficient rapidity; and\r\nfrom its immense accumulation, soon overtops the banks of the\r\nriver, and covers the whole of the low country.\r\n\r\nLIVERPOOL.\r\n\r\nThe town of Liverpool is situated on the banks of Geoge's\r\nriver, at the distance of eighteen miles from Sydney. It was\r\nfounded by Governor Macquarie, and is now of about six years\r\nstanding. Its population may amount to about two hundred souls,\r\nand is composed of a small detachment of military, of\r\ncultivators, and a few artificers, traders, publicans, and\r\nlabourers.\r\n\r\nThe public buildings are a church (not yet I believe\r\ncompleted) a school house and stores for the reception and issue\r\nof provisions to such of the settlers in the adjacent districts\r\nas are victualled at the expense of the government. These\r\nbuildings, however, as might naturally be expected from the very\r\nrecent establishment of this town, are but little superior in\r\ntheir appearance to the rude dwellings of its inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe river is about half the size of the Hawkesbury, and is\r\nnavigable for boats of twenty tons burden as high up as the town.\r\nIt empties itself into Botany Bay, which is about fourteen miles\r\nto the southward of the heads of Port Jackson. It is subject to\r\nthe same sort of inundations as the Hawkesbury; but they are not\r\nin general of so violent and destructive a nature. The tide rises\r\nabout the same height as in that river, and the current is, I\r\nbelieve, nearly of the same velocity.\r\n\r\nThe position of this town is all that can be urged in support\r\nof the probability of its future progress; the land in its\r\nvicinity being in general of a very indifferent quality. It is in\r\na central situation, between Sydney and the fertile districts of\r\nBringelly, Arids, Appin, Bunpury Curran, Cabramatta, and the\r\nSeven Islands, to which last place the tide of colonization is at\r\npresent principally directing itself. There can be no doubt,\r\ntherefore, that the town of Liverpool will, in a few years,\r\nbecome a place of considerable size and importance. Land there is\r\nas yet of very trifling value; and a lease may be obtained by any\r\nfree person from the government, on the simple condition of\r\nerecting a house on it.\r\n\r\nSociety is upon a much better footing throughout the colony,\r\nin general than might naturally be imagined, considering the\r\ningredients of which it is composed. In Sydney the civil and\r\nmilitary officers with their families form a circle at once\r\nselect and extended, without including the numerous highly\r\nrespectable families of merchants and settlers who reside there.\r\nUnfortunately, however, this town is not free from those\r\ndivisions which are so prevalent in all small communities.\r\nScandal appears to be the favourite amusement to which idlers\r\nresort to kill time and prevent ennui; and consequently, the same\r\nfamilies are eternally changing from friendship to hostility, and\r\nfrom hostility back again to friendship.\r\n\r\nIn the other towns these dissensions are not so common,\r\nbecause the circle of society is more circumscribed; and in the\r\ndistricts where there are no towns at all, they are still more\r\nrare; because in such situations people have too much need of one\r\nanother's intercourse and assistance to propagate reports\r\ninjurious to their neighbour's character, unless on grave\r\noccasions, and where their assertions are founded on truth.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, the state of society in these settlements\r\nis much the same, as among an equal population in the country\r\nparts of this kingdom. Of the number of respectable persons that\r\nthey contain, some estimate may be formed if we refer to the\r\nparties which are given on particular days at the Government\r\nHouse. It appears from the Sydney Gazette of the 24th January,\r\n1818, that one hundred and sixty ladies and gentlemen were\r\npresent at a ball and supper which was given there on the 18th of\r\nthat month, in celebration of her late majesty's birth-day.\r\n\r\nThere are at present no public amusements in this colony. Many\r\nyears since, there was a theatre, and more latterly, annual\r\nraces; but it was found that the society was not sufficiently\r\nmature for such establishments. Dinner and supper parties are\r\nvery frequent in Sydney; and it generally happens that a few\r\nsubscription balls take place in the course of the year. Upon the\r\nwhole it may be safely asserted, that the natural disposition of\r\nthe people to sociality has not only been in no wise impaired by\r\ntheir change of scene, but that all classes of the colonists are\r\nmore hospitable than persons of similar means in this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThere are four courts in this colony, established by charter,\r\nviz. the Court of Admiralty, the Court of Criminal Judicature,\r\nthe Governor's Court, the Supreme Court, and the High Court of\r\nAppeals.\r\n\r\nThe Court of Vice Admiralty consists of the Judge Advocate,\r\nand takes cognizance of captures, salvages, and such other\r\nmatters of dispute as arise on the high seas; but it has no\r\ncriminal jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nThe Court of Criminal Judicature, consists of the Judge\r\nAdvocate and six officers of His Majesty's sea and land forces,\r\nor of either, appointed by the governor. This court takes\r\ncognizance of all treasons, felonies, misdemeanors, and in fact\r\nof all criminal offences whatsoever; and afterwards adjudges\r\ndeath or such other punishment as the law of England may have\r\naffixed to the respective crimes of which the prisoners may be\r\nfound guilty.\r\n\r\nThe Governor's Court consists of the Judge Advocate and two\r\ninhabitants of the colony, appointed by precept from the\r\ngovernor, and takes cognizance of all pleas where the amount sued\r\nfor does not exceed £50 sterling, (except such pleas as may\r\narise between party and party at Van Dieman's Land) and from its\r\ndecisions there is no appeal.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court is composed of the judge of this court and\r\ntwo magistrates, appointed by precept from the governor; and its\r\njurisdiction extends to all pleas where the matter in dispute\r\nexceeds £50 sterling. From its judgments, however, appeals\r\nlie to the High Court of Appeals.\r\n\r\nThis latter court is presided by the governor himself,\r\nassisted by the Judge Advocate; and its decisions are final in\r\nall cases where the amount sued for does not exceed three\r\nthousand pounds; but where the sum at issue exceeds this amount,\r\nan appeal lies in the last instance to the king in council.\r\n\r\nThese courts regulate their decisions by the law of England,\r\nand take no notice whatever of the laws and regulations which\r\nhave been made at various times by the local government. The\r\nenforcement of these is left entirely to the magistracy, who\r\nassemble weekly in the different towns throughout the colony, and\r\ntake cognizance of all infractions, as well of the colonial as of\r\nthe criminal code. The courts thus formed by the magistrates, go\r\nby the name of \"Benches of Magistrates,\" and answer pretty nearly\r\nto the \"courts of general quarter sessions for the peace,\" held\r\nin the respective counties of this kingdom; and, generally\r\nspeaking, they exercise a jurisdiction perfectly similar.\r\n\r\nThe roads and bridges which have been made to every part of\r\nthe colony, are truly surprising, considering the short period\r\nthat has elapsed since its foundation. All these are either the\r\nwork of, or have been improved by, the present governor; who has\r\neven caused a road to be constructed over the western mountains,\r\nas far as the depot at Bathurst Plains, which is upwards of 180\r\nmiles from Sydney. The colonists, therefore, are now provided\r\nwith every facility for the conveyance of their produce to\r\nmarket; a circumstance which cannot fail to have the most\r\nbeneficial influence in the progress of agriculture. In return\r\nfor these great public accommodations, and to help to keep them\r\nin repair, the Governor has established toll-gates* in all the\r\nprincipal roads. These are farmed out to the highest bidder, and\r\nwere let during the year 1817, for the sum of £257.\r\n\r\n[* For a list of tolls, see the\r\nAppendix]\r\n\r\nThe military force stationed in the colony consists ofseven\r\ncompanies of the forty-eighth regiment, and the Royal Veteran\r\nCompany; which, form an effective body of about seven hundred\r\nfirelocks. These have to garrison the two principal settlements\r\nat Van Diemen's Land, to provide a company for the establishment\r\nat the Coal River, and to furnish parties for the various towns\r\nand outposts of the extended territory of Port Jackson: so that\r\nvery few troops remain at head quarters. The colony is\r\nconsequently considered to be greatly in need of a further\r\naccession of military strength. Much anxiety is felt on this\r\nsubject by the generality of the inhabitants, who have not yet\r\nforgotten the insurrection which took place when the whole\r\npopulation was not nearly so great as the present amount of the\r\nconvicts, although the military force was of equal magnitude.\r\nThat insurrection indeed was easily quelled; but the result of\r\nanother, under existing circumstances, would in all probability,\r\nbe very different.\r\n\r\nAn equal degree of anxiety is felt, and more particularly by\r\nthe mercantile part of the community, that a sloop of war, or a\r\nking's vessel of some description, should be stationed in the\r\nharbour, both as a protection against the easy possibility of\r\noutward assault, and to frustrate the numerous combinations which\r\nthe convicts are constantly forming, and often too successfully,\r\nto carry away the colonial craft, to the certain destruction of\r\ntheir own and the crew's lives, and to the ruin of the\r\nunfortunate owners Not fewer than three piratical seizures of\r\nthis nature have been effected within the last three years. On\r\nall of these occasions the vessels so seized were run ashore on\r\nthe uninhabited parts of the coast, and all hands on board, the\r\ninnocent crews, as well as the abandoned pirates, either perished\r\nfrom hunger, or were immolated by the spears and waddies of the\r\nferocious savages.\r\n\r\nWhen Governor Macquarie assumed the command in 1810, the\r\npopulation was only half its present number; and yet a sloop of\r\nwar was stationed at Port Jackson, and the military force also\r\nwas on a much more extended scale. Why a diminution has thus been\r\nmade in the means of protection and defence, when there appear to\r\nbe such strong grounds for their augmentation, merely with\r\nreference to the internal state of the colony, it is no easy\r\nmatter to conjecture.\r\n\r\nThe expediency also of putting the colony in a better posture\r\nto repel outward attack, is not less obvious; for although we are\r\nnow at peace with the whole world, it would be absurd to overlook\r\nthe possibility of future wars. The only battery of any strength\r\nis called, \"Dawe's Battery;\" and is, as I have already casually\r\nnoticed, situated in the extremity of that neck of land, on which\r\nthe western part of the town of Sydney is built. This battery, if\r\nI remember right, mounts fourteen long eighteen-pounders, but the\r\ncarriages of the guns are in a bad state of repair, and the\r\nembrasures are so low, that a single broadside of grape would\r\nsweep off all who had the courage or temerity to defend it.\r\n\r\nFort Philip stands on the highest part of the same neck of\r\nland, and nearly in the centre of that part of the town which\r\ngoes by the name of \"the Rocks.\" This fort was erected by\r\nGovernor King, immediately after the insurrection, to which I\r\nhave alluded. It is a regular hexagon, but it never was quite\r\nfinished, and there are no guns yet mounted on it. The glacis, in\r\nfact, is not sufficiently levelled to allow a proper range for\r\nartillery, and the circumjacent ground is so irregular and rocky,\r\nthat an enemy might at once erect batteries at fifty yards\r\ndistance. Besides, this fort is so completely hemmed in with\r\nhouses, that a great part of the town would be inevitably\r\ndestroyed by the fire from it. Its situation, therefore, is in\r\nevery point of view objectionable, and succeeding governors have\r\nevinced their good sense, in not perfecting a work which would be\r\nattended with a very considerable expense, and could never become\r\nof any utility.\r\n\r\nA new battery has lately been commenced on Bennilong's Point;\r\nbut this and Dawe's Battery are both too near the town to protect\r\nit from the most insignificant naval force. It is indeed a matter\r\nof surprise, that during the last American war, not one of the\r\nnumberless privateers of that nation, attempted to lay the town\r\nof Sydney under contribution, or to plunder it. A vessel of ten\r\nguns might have effected this enterprise with the greatest ease\r\nand safety; and that the inhabitants were not subjected to such\r\nan insulting humiliation, could only have arisen from the enemy's\r\nignorance of the insufficiency of their means of defence.\r\n\r\nThe climate of the colony, particularly in the inland\r\ndistricts, is highly salubrious, although the heats in summer are\r\nsometimes excessive, the thermometer frequently rising in the\r\nshade to ninety, and even to a hundred degrees and upwards of\r\nFahrenheit. This, however, happens only during the hot winds; and\r\nthese do not prevail upon an average, more than eight or ten days\r\nin the year. The mean heat during the three summer months,\r\nDecember, January, and February, is about 80 degrees at noon.\r\nThis, it must be admitted, is a degree of heat that would be\r\nhighly oppressive to Europeans, were it not that the sea breeze\r\nsets in regularly about nine o'clock in the morning, and blows\r\nwith considerable force from the N. E. till about six or seven\r\no'clock in the evening. It is succeeded during the night by the\r\nland breeze from the mountains, which varies from W. S. W. to W.\r\nIn very hot days the sea breeze often veersround to the North and\r\nblows a gale. In this case it continues with great violence,\r\nfrequently for a day or two, and is then succeeded not by the\r\nregularland breeze, but by a cold southerly squall. The hot winds\r\nblow from the N. W. and doubtless imbibe their heat from the\r\nimmense tract of country which they traverse. While they prevail\r\nthe sea and land breezes entirely cease. They seldom, however,\r\ncontinue for more than two days at a time, and are always\r\nsuperseded by a cold southerly gale, generally accompanied with\r\nrain. The thermometer then sinks sometimes as low as 60 degrees,\r\nand a variation of temperature of from 30 degrees to 40 degrees\r\ntakes place in half an hour. These southerly gales usually last\r\nat this season from twelve to twenty-four hours, and then give\r\nway to the regular sea and land breezes.\r\n\r\nDuring these three months violent storms of thunder and\r\nlightning are very frequent, and the heavy falls of rain which\r\ntake place on these occasions, tend considerably to refresh the\r\ncountry, of which the verdure in all but low moist situations\r\nentirely disappears. At this season the most unpleasant part of\r\nthe day is the interval which elapses between the cessation of\r\nthe land breeze and the setting in of the sea. This happens\r\ngenerally between six and eight o'clock in the morning, when the\r\nthermometer is upon an average at about 72 degrees. During this\r\ninterval the sea is as smooth as glass, and not a zephyr is found\r\nto disport even among the topmost boughs of the loftiest\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nThe three autumn months are March, April, and May. The weather\r\nin March is generally very unsettled. This month, in fact, may be\r\nconsidered the rainy season, and has been more fertile in floods\r\nthan any other of the year. The thermometer varies during the day\r\nabout 15 degrees, being at day-light as low as from 55 degrees to\r\n60 degrees, and at noon as high as from 70 degrees to 75 degrees.\r\nThe sea and land breezes at this time become very feeble,\r\nalthough they occasionally prevail during the whole year. The\r\nusual winds from the end of March to the beginning of September,\r\nare from S. to S. W.\r\n\r\nThe weather in the commencement of April is frequently\r\nshowery, but towards the middle it gradually becomes more\r\nsettled, and towards the conclusion perfectly clear and serene.\r\nThe thermometer at the beginning of the month varies from 72\r\ndegrees to 74 degrees at noon, and from the middle to the end\r\ngradually declines to 66 degrees and sometimes to 60 degrees. In\r\nthe mornings it is as low as 52 degrees, and fires become in\r\nconsequence general throughout the colony.\r\n\r\nThe weather in the month of May is truly delightful. The\r\natmosphere is perfectly cloudless, and the mornings and evenings\r\nbecome with the advance of the month more chilly, and render a\r\ngood fire a highly comfortable and cheering guest. Even during\r\nthe middle of the day the most violent exercise may be taken\r\nwithout inconvenience. The thermometer at sun-rise is under 50\r\ndegrees, and seldom above 60 degrees at noon.\r\n\r\nThe three winter months are June, July, and August. During\r\nthis interval the mornings and evenings are very chilly, and the\r\nnights excessively cold. Hoar frosts are frequent, and become\r\nmore severe the further you advance into the interior. Ice half\r\nan inch thick is found at the distance of twenty miles from the\r\ncoast. Very little rain falls at this season, but the dews are\r\nvery heavy when it does not freeze, and tend considerably to\r\npreserve the young crops from the effects of drought. Fogs too\r\nare frequent and dense in low damp situations, and on the banks\r\nof the rivers. The mean temperature at day-light is from 40\r\ndegrees to 45 degrees, and at noon from 55 degrees to 60\r\ndegrees.\r\n\r\nThe spring months are September, October, and November. In the\r\nbeginning of September the fogs still continue; the nights are\r\ncold, but the days clear and pleasant. Towards the close of this\r\nmonth the cold begins very sensibly to moderate. Light showers\r\noccasionally prevail, accompanied with thunder and lightning. The\r\nthermometer at the beginning of the month is seldom above 60\r\ndegrees at noon, but towards the end frequently rises to 70\r\ndegrees.\r\n\r\nIn October there are also occasional showers, but the weather\r\nupon the whole is clear and pleasant. The days gradually become\r\nwarmer, and the blighting north-west winds are to be apprehended.\r\nThe sea and land breezes again resume their full sway. The\r\nthermometer at sun-rise varies from 60 degrees to 65 degrees, and\r\nat noon is frequently up to 80 degrees.\r\n\r\nIn November the weather may be again called hot. Dry parching\r\nwinds prevail as the month advances, and squalls of thunder and\r\nlightning with rain or hail. The thermometer at day-light is\r\nseldom under 65 degrees, and frequently at noon rises to 80\r\ndegrees, 84 degrees, and even 90 degrees.\r\n\r\nSuch is the temperature throughout the year at Port Jackson.\r\nIn the inland districts to the eastward of the mountains, the\r\nthermometer is upon an average 5 degrees lower in the morning,\r\nand the same number of degrees higher at noon throughout the\r\nwinter season, but during the summer months it is 5 degrees\r\nhigher at all hours of the day. On the mountains themselves, and\r\nin the country to the westward of them, the climate, in\r\nconsequence of their superior elevation, is much more temperate.\r\nHeavy falls of snow take place during the winter, and remain\r\nsometimes for many days on the summits of the loftiest hills; but\r\nin the valleys the snow immediately dissolves. The frosts too are\r\nmuch more severe, and the winters are of longer duration. All the\r\nseasons indeed are more distinctly marked to the westward of the\r\nmountains, and bear a much stronger resemblance to the\r\ncorresponding ones in this country.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing account of the state of the weather and\r\ntemperature during the various seasons of the year, it will be\r\nseen that the climate of the colony is upon the whole highly\r\nsalubrious and delightful. If the summers are occasionally a\r\nlittle too hot for the European constitution, it will be\r\nremembered that the extreme heats which I have noticed as\r\nhappening during the north-west winds, are of but short\r\ncontinuance; and that the sea and land breezes, which prevail at\r\nthis season in an almost uninterrupted succession, moderate the\r\ntemperature so effectually, that even new comers are but little\r\nincommoded by it, and the old residents experience no\r\ninconvenience from it whatever. The sea breeze indeed is not so\r\nsensibly felt in the interior as on the coast, by reason of the\r\ngreat extent of forest which it has to traverse before the\r\ninhabitants of the inland districts can receive the benefit of\r\nit. This circumstance not only diminishes its force, but also\r\ndeprives it in a great measure of that refreshing coolness which\r\nit imparts when inhaled fresh from the bosom of the ocean. The\r\nheat consequently in the interior, particularly in low\r\nsituations, is much more intense than on the coast; but by way of\r\ncompensation for the advantage which in this respect the\r\ndistricts in the vicinity of the sea possess over the inland\r\nones, these latter are from the same causes that impede the\r\napproach of the sea breeze, exempt from the sudden and violent\r\nvariations of temperature, which are occasioned by the southerly\r\nwinds, and are without doubt the reason why pulmonic affections\r\nare so much more prevalent in Sydney than in the interior. The\r\nhot season, however, which is undoubtedly the most unhealthy part\r\nof the year, does not, as will have been perceived, continue\r\nabove four months. The remaining eight possess a temperature so\r\nhighly moderate and congenial to the human constitution, that the\r\nclimate of this colony would upon the whole, appear to justify\r\nthe glowing enthusiasm of those who have ventured to call it the\r\nMontpellier of the world.\r\n\r\nAbdominal and pulmonic complains are the two prevalent\r\ndiseases. The abdominal complaints are confined principally to\r\ndysentery. This disorder is most common among the poorer classes\r\nand new comers. In these it is generally intimately connected\r\nwith scurvy, and in both cases it is for the most part greatly\r\naggravated by the excessive use of spirituous liquors, to which\r\nthe mass of the colonists are unfortunately addicted.\r\n\r\nThe pulmonic affections are generally contracted at an early\r\nperiod by the youth of both sexes, and are occasioned by the\r\ngreat and sudden variations of temperature already noticed. They\r\nare not, however, accompanied with that violent inflammatory\r\naction which distinguishes them in this country; but proceed\r\nslowly and gradually, till from neglect they terminate in\r\nphthisis. They are said to bear a strong affinity to the\r\ncomplaint of the same nature which prevails at the Island of\r\nMadeira; and it is remarkable, that in both these colonies a\r\nchange of air affords the only chance of restoration to the\r\nnatives; whereas foreigners labouring under phthisis upon their\r\narrival in either of these places, find almost instantaneous\r\nrelief.\r\n\r\nThere are no infantile diseases whatever. The measles, hooping\r\ncough, and small pox, are entirely unknown. Some few years,\r\nindeed, before the foundation of this colony, the small pox\r\ncommitted the most dreadful ravages among the aborigines. This\r\nexterminating scourge is said to have been introduced by Captain\r\nCook, and many of the contemporaries of those who fell victims to\r\nit, are still living; and the deep furrows which remain in some\r\nof their countenances, shew how narrowly they escaped the same\r\npremature destiny. The recollection of this dreadful malady will\r\nlong survive in the traditionary songs of this simple people. The\r\nconsternation which it excited is still as fresh in their minds\r\nas if it had been but an occurrence of yesterday, although the\r\ngeneration which witnessed its horrors, has almost past away. The\r\nmoment one of them was seized with it, it was the signal for\r\nabandoning him to his fate. Brothers deserted their brothers,\r\nchildren their parents, and parents their children; and in some\r\nof the caves on the coast, heaps of decayed bones still indicate\r\nthe spots where the helpless sufferers were left to expire, not\r\nso much perhaps from the violence of the disease as from the want\r\nof sustenance.\r\n\r\nThis fatal instance of the inveteracy of this disorder, when\r\nonce introduced into the colony, has not been without its\r\ncounterpoising benefit. It has induced the local government to\r\nadopt proper measures for avoiding the propagation of a similar\r\ncontagion among the colonists. The vaccine matter was introduced\r\nwith this view many years back; but as all the children in the\r\ncolony were immediately inoculated, it was again lost from the\r\nwant of a sufficient number of subjects to afford a supply of\r\nfresh virus; and for many years afterwards, every effort that was\r\nmade for its re-introduction proved abortive. Through the\r\nindefatigable exertions, however, of Doctor Burke, of the\r\nMauritius, the colonists are again in possession of this\r\ninestimable blessing; and there can be no doubt that proper\r\nprecautions will be taken to prevent them from being again\r\ndeprived of it.\r\n\r\nThe colony of New South Wales possesses every variety of soil,\r\nfrom the sandy heath, and the cold hungry clay, to the fertile\r\nloam and the deep vegetable mould. For the distance of five or\r\nsix miles from the coast, the land is in general extremely\r\nbarren, being a poor hungry sand, thickly studded with rocks. A\r\nfew miserable stunted gums, and a dwarf underwood, are the\r\nrichest productions of the best part of it; while the rest never\r\ngives birth to a tree at all, and is only covered with low\r\nflowering shrubs, whose infinite diversity, however, and\r\nextraordinary beauty, render this wild heath the most interesting\r\npart of the country for the botanist, and make even the less\r\nscientific beholder forget the nakedness and sterility of the\r\nscene.\r\n\r\nBeyond this barren waste, which thus forms a girdle to the\r\ncoast, the country suddenly begins to improve. The soil changes\r\nto a thin layer of vegetable mould, resting on a stratum of\r\nyellow clay, which is again supported by a deep bed of schistus.\r\nThe trees of the forest are here of the most stately dimensions.\r\nFull sized gums and iron barks, along side of which the loftiest\r\ntrees in this country would appear as pigmies, with the beefwood\r\ntree, or as it is generally termed, the forest oak, which is of\r\nmuch humbler growth, are the usual timber. The forest is\r\nextremely thick, but there is little or no underwood. A poor sour\r\ngrass, which is too effectually sheltered from the rays of the\r\nsun, to be possessed of any nutritive and fattening properties,\r\nshoots up in the intervals. This description of country, with a\r\nfew exceptions, however, which deserve not to be particularly\r\nnoticed, forms another girdle of about ten miles in breadth: so\r\nthat, generally speaking, the colony for about sixteen miles into\r\nthe interior, may be said to possess a soil, which has naturally\r\nno claim to fertility, and will require all the skill and\r\nindustry of its owners to render it even tolerably\r\nproductive.\r\n\r\nAt this distance, however, the aspect of the country begins\r\nrapidly to improve. The forest is less thick, and the trees in\r\ngeneral are of another description; the iron barks, yellow gums,\r\nand forest oaks disappearing, and the stringy barks, blue gums,\r\nand box trees, generally usurping their stead. When you have\r\nadvanced about four miles further into the interior, you are at\r\nlength gratified with the appearance of a country truly\r\nbeautiful. An endless variety of hill and dale, clothed in the\r\nmost luxuriant herbage, and covered with bleating flocks and\r\nlowing herds, at length indicate that you are in regions fit to\r\nbe inhabited by civilized man. The soil has no longer the stamp\r\nof barrenness. A rich loam resting on a substratum of fat red\r\nclay, several feet in depth, is found even on the tops of the\r\nhighest hills, which in general do not yield in fertility to the\r\nvallies. The timber, strange as it may appear, is of inferior\r\nsize, though still of the same nature, i. e. blue gum, box, and\r\nstringy bark. There is no underwood, and the number of trees upon\r\nan acre do not upon an average exceed thirty. They are, in fact,\r\nso thin, that a person may gallop without difficulty in every\r\ndirection. Coursing the kangaroo is the favourite amusement of\r\nthe colonists, who generally pursue this animal at full speed on\r\nhorseback, and frequently manage, notwithstanding its\r\nextraordinary swiftness, to be up at the death; so trifling are\r\nthe impediments occasioned by the forest.\r\n\r\nThe above general description may be applied with tolerable\r\naccuracy, to the whole tract of country which lies between this\r\nspace and the Nepean River. The plains, however, on the banks of\r\nthis river, which are in many places of considerable extent, are\r\nof far greater fertility, being a rich vegetable mould, many feet\r\nin depth, and have without doubt, been gradually formed by\r\ndepositions from it during the periods of its inundations. These\r\nplains gradually enlarge themselves until you arrive at the\r\njunction of the Nepean with the Hawkesbury, on each side of which\r\nthey are commonly from a mile to a mile and a half in breadth.\r\nThe banks of this latter river are of still greater fertility\r\nthan the banks of the former, and may vie in this respect with\r\nthe far-famed banks of the Nile. The same acre of land there has\r\nbeen known to produce in the course of one year, fifty bushels of\r\nwheat and a hundred of maize. The settlers have never any\r\noccasion for manure, since the slimy depositions from the river,\r\neffectually counteract the exhaustion that would otherwise be\r\nproduced by incessant crops. The timber on the banks of these\r\nrivers is for the most part apple tree, which is very beautiful,\r\nand bears in its foliage and shape a striking resemblance to the\r\noak of this country. Its wood, however, is of no value except for\r\nfiring, and for the immense quantity of pot-ash which might be\r\nmade from it. The blue gum and stringy bark are also very common\r\non these flooded lands, and of the best description. The banks of\r\nthe Hawkesbury formerly produced cedar, but it has long since\r\nentirely disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe banks of these rivers, and indeed the whole tract of\r\ncountry, (generally speaking) which I have described, with the\r\nexception of the barren waste in the vicinity of the coast, are,\r\nto use the colonial term, located, i. e. either granted away to\r\nindividuals, or attached as commons to the cultivated districts.\r\nIt may not, therefore, be unacceptable to many of my readers, to\r\nlearn the particulars of those unappropriated tracts of land\r\nwithin the immediate precincts of Port Jackson, which are best\r\nadapted to the purposes of colonization.\r\n\r\nCOW PASTURES.\r\n\r\nOf these \"the cow pastures\" rank first in point of proximity.\r\nThis tract of land has hitherto been reserved for the use of the\r\nwild cattle; although these animals have for some time past\r\ndisappeared, either from having found an outlet into the\r\ninterior, through the surrounding mountains, or what is a still\r\nmore probable conjecture, from the exterminating incursions of\r\nthe numerous poor settlers, who have farms in the neighbourhood,\r\nand who, considering their general poverty, it is easy to\r\nbelieve, would not suffer the want of animal food, so long as\r\nthey could take their dogs and guns, and kill a cow or calf at\r\ntheir option. These wild cattle were the progeny of a few tame\r\nones, which strayed away from the settlement shortly after the\r\nperiod of its foundation, and were not discovered till about\r\nfifteen years afterwards, when they had multiplied to several\r\nthousands. On their discovery they immediately attracted the\r\nattention of his majesty's ministers, and orders were dispatched\r\nfrom this country, prohibiting the governor and his successors\r\nfrom granting away the land, on which they had fixed themselves.\r\nThis they soon overspread, and on the occasion of the severe\r\ndroughts that were experienced in the colony in the years 1813,\r\n1814, and 1815, great numbers of them perished from the want of\r\nwater and pasturage. Where thousands then existed, there are\r\nscarcely hundreds to be found at present, and these chiefly\r\nconsist of bulls. A cow or calf can very rarely be met with.\r\nThere can consequently be very little doubt that they have\r\ndisappeared in the manner I have conjectured, and that their\r\nnumbers have been thus considerably reduced by the depredations\r\nof the poorer settlers, which it was for a long time thought\r\nbeyond the power of the colonial courts to restrain; since,\r\nalthough it was notorious that these wild cattle were originally\r\npurchased by the crown, still the cattle of individuals had\r\nsubsequently, at various times, intermixed with them, and\r\nprevented that identification of property, which the late judge\r\nadvocate considered essential to the conviction of the offenders.\r\nHis opinion, however, has been overruled by his successor, and\r\nseveral persons have been lately tried for and found guilty of\r\nthis offence; and although they were not punished capitally for\r\nit, there can be no doubt that their conviction will greatly\r\ndiminish such depredations for the future. Not that I consider\r\nthe preservation of these wild herds will be attended with any\r\nadvantages to the colony. On the contrary, it is my belief, that\r\ntheir total destruction ought to be effected; since the increase\r\nof them is of mere negative importance, compared with the\r\npositive disadvantage that attends their occupation of one of the\r\nmost fertile districts in the colony, which it is to be hoped\r\nwill be soon covered with numerous flocks of fine wooled sheep,\r\nfor the pasture of which the greater part of it is so admirably\r\nadapted. This tract of land is about thirty miles distant from\r\nSydney: it is bounded on the east by the river Nepean, on the\r\nwest by the Blue Mountains, of which this river, on the north\r\nside of the cow pastures washes the base, so that they together\r\nform the northern boundary, and on the south by a thick barren\r\nbrush of about ten miles in breadth, which these cattle have\r\nnever been able to penetrate. This fine tract of country is thus\r\nsurrounded by natural boundaries, which form it into an enclosure\r\nsomewhat in the shape of an oblong spheroid. It contains about\r\none hundred thousand acres of good land, a considerable portion\r\nof which is flooded, and equal to any on the banks of the\r\nHawkesbury.\r\n\r\nFIVE ISLANDS.\r\n\r\nThe next considerable tract of unappropriated land is the\r\ndistrict called the Five Islands. It commences at the distance of\r\nabout forty miles to the southward of Sydney, and extends to\r\nShoal Haven river. This tract of land lies between the coast and\r\na high range of hills which terminate at the north side abruptly\r\nin the sea, and form its northern and western boundary: the ocean\r\nis its eastern boundary, and Shoal Haven river its southern. The\r\nrange that surrounds this district on the north and west is a\r\nbranch of the Blue Mountains; and the only road at present known\r\nto it, is down a pass so remarkably steep, that unless a better\r\nbe discovered, the communication between it and the capital by\r\nland, will always be difficult and dangerous for waggons. This\r\ncircumstance is a material counterpoise to its extraordinary\r\nfertility, and is the reason why it is at present unoccupied by\r\nany but large stockholders. Those parts, however, which are\r\nsituated near Shoal Haven river, are highly eligible for\r\nagricultural purposes; since this river is navigable for about\r\ntwenty miles into the country for vessels of seventy or eighty\r\ntons burden; a circumstance which holds out to future colonists\r\nthe greatest facilities for the cheap and expeditious conveyance\r\nof their produce to market. The land on the banks of this river\r\nis of the same nature, and possesses equal fertility with the\r\nbanks of the Hawkesbury. There are several streams in different\r\nparts of this district, which issue from the mountain behind, and\r\nafford an abundant supply of pure water. In many places there are\r\nlarge prairies of unparalleled richness, entirely free from\r\ntimber, and consequently prepared by the hand of nature for the\r\nimmediate reception of the ploughshare. These advantages,\r\ncombined with its proximity to Sydney, have already begun to\r\nattract the tide of colonization to it, and will no doubt render\r\nit in a few years one of the most populous, productive, and\r\nvaluable of all the districts. The soil is in general a deep fat\r\nvegetable mould. The surface of the country is thinly timbered,\r\nwith the exception of the mountain which boundsit to the\r\nNorthward and Westward. This is covered with a thick brush, but\r\nis nevertheless extremely fertile up to the very summit, and\r\npeculiarly adapted both from its eastern aspect and mild climate\r\nfor the cultivation of the vine. This large tract of country was\r\nonly discovered about four years since, and has not yet been\r\naccurately surveyed. Its extent, therefore, is not precisely\r\nknown; but it without doubt contains several hundred thousand\r\nacres, including the banks of the Shoal Haven river. These\r\nproduce a great abundance of fine cedar, and other highly\r\nvaluable timber, for which there is an extensive and increasing\r\ndemand at Port Jackson.\r\n\r\nCOAL RIVER.\r\n\r\nThe next tract of unappropriated country which I shall\r\ndescribe, is the district of the Coal River. The town of\r\nNewcastle is situated at the mouth of this river, and is about\r\nsixty miles to the northward of Port Jackson. Its population by\r\nthe last census forwarded to this country, was five hundred and\r\nfifty souls. These, with the exception of a few free settlers,\r\nestablished on the upper banks of this river, amounting with\r\ntheir families perhaps to thirty souls, and about fifty troops,\r\nare all incorrigible offenders, who have been convicted either\r\nbefore a bench of magistrates, or the Court of Criminal\r\nJudicature, and afterwards re-transported to this place, where\r\nthey are worked in chains from sunrise to sunset, and profitably\r\nemployed in burning lime and procuring coals and timber, as well\r\nfor carrying on the public works at Port Jackson, as for the\r\nprivate purposes of individuals, who pay the government\r\nstipulated prices for these different articles. This settlement\r\nwas, in fact, established with the two-fold view of supplying the\r\npublic works with these necessary articles, and providing a\r\nseparate place of punishment for all who might be convicted of\r\ncrimes in the colonial courts.\r\n\r\nThe coal mines here are considerably elevated above the level\r\nof the sea, and are of the richest description. The veins are\r\nvisible on the abrupt face of the cliff, which borders the\r\nharbour, and are worked by adits or openings, which serve both to\r\ncarry off the water and to wheel away the coals. The quantity\r\nprocured in this easy manner is very great, and might be\r\nincreased to any extent. So much more coals indeed are thus\r\nobtained than are required for the purposes of the government,\r\nthat they are glad to dispose of them to all persons who are\r\nwilling to purchase, requiring in return a duty of two shillings\r\nand six pence per ton, for such as are intended for home\r\nconsumption, and five shillings for such as are for\r\nexportation.\r\n\r\nThe lime procured at this settlement is made from oyster\r\nshells, which are found in prodigious abundance. These shells lie\r\nclose to the banks of the river, in beds of amazing size and\r\ndepth. How they came there has long been a matter of surprise and\r\nspeculation to the colonists. Some are of opinion that they have\r\nbeen gradually deposited by the natives in those periodical\r\nfeasts of shell fish, for the celebration of which they still\r\nassemble at stated seasons in large bodies: others have\r\ncontended, and I think with more probability, that they were\r\noriginally large natural beds of oysters, and that the river has\r\non some occasion or other, either changed its course or\r\ncontracted its limits, and thus deserted them.\r\n\r\nThese beds are generally five or six feet above high-water\r\nmark. The process of making lime from them is extremely simple\r\nand expeditious. They are first dug up and sifted, and then piled\r\nover large heaps of dry wood, which are set fire to, and speedily\r\nconvert the superincumbent mass into excellent lime. When thus\r\nmade it is shipped for Sydney, and sold at one shilling per\r\nbushel.\r\n\r\nThe timber procured on the banks of this river is chiefly\r\ncedar and rose wood. The cedar, however, is becoming scarce in\r\nconsequence of the immense quantities that have been already cut\r\ndown, and cannot be any longer obtained without going at least a\r\nhundred and fifty miles up the river. At this distance, however,\r\nit is still to be had in considerable abundance, and is easily\r\nfloated down to the town in rafts. The government dispose of this\r\nwood in the same manner as the coals, at the price of £3\r\nfor each thousand square feet, intended for home consumption, and\r\n£6 for the same quantity if exported.\r\n\r\nThis settlement is placed under the direction of a commandant,\r\nwho is selected out of the officers of the regiment stationed in\r\nthe colony, and is allowed, as has been noticed, about fifty\r\nfire-locks to maintain his authority. He is always appointed to\r\nthe magistracy previously to his obtaining this command, and is\r\nentrusted with the entire controul of the prisoners, whom he\r\npunishes or rewards as their conduct may appear to him to\r\nmerit.\r\n\r\nThe harbour at the mouth of this river is tolerably secure and\r\nspacious, and contains sufficient depth of water for vessels of\r\nthree hundred tons burden. The river itself, however, is only\r\nnavigable for small craft of thirty or forty tons burden, and\r\nthis only for about fifty miles above the town. Just beyond this\r\ndistance there are numerous flats and shallows, which only admit\r\nof the passage of boats over them. This river has three branches;\r\nthey are called the upper, the lower, and the middle branch: the\r\ntwo former are navigable for boats for about a hundred and twenty\r\nmiles, the latter for upwards of two hundred miles. The banks of\r\nall these branches are liable to inundations equally terrific\r\nwith those at the Hawkesbury, and from the same causes; because\r\nthey are receptacles for the rain that is collected by the Blue\r\nMountains, which form the western boundary of this district, and\r\ndivide it as well as the districts of Port Jackson, from the\r\ngreat western wilderness. The low lands within the reach of these\r\ninundations is if possible of still greater exuberancy than the\r\nbanks of the Hawkesbury and Nepean, and of four times the extent.\r\nThe high-land, or to give it the colonial appellation, the forest\r\nland, is very thinly studded with timber, and equal for all the\r\npurposes of agriculture and grazing to the best districts of Port\r\nJackson. The climate too is equally salubrious, and on the upper\r\nbanks of the middle branch, it is generally believed, that the\r\nsummer heats are sufficient for the production of cotton; the\r\ncultivation of which would become an inexhaustible source of\r\nwealth to the growers, and would afford a valuable article of\r\nexport to the colony.\r\n\r\nIn fact, under every point of view this district contains the\r\nstrongest inducements to colonization. It possesses a navigable\r\nriver, by which its produce may be conveyed to market at a\r\ntrifling expence, and the inhabitants of its most remote parts\r\nmay receive such articles of foreign or domestic growth and\r\nmanufacture as they may need, at a moderate advance: it surpasses\r\nPort Jackson in the general fertility of its soil, and at least\r\nrivals it in the salubrity of its climate: it contains in the\r\ngreatest abundance coal, lime, and many varieties of valuable\r\ntimber which are not found elsewhere, and promise to become\r\narticles of considerable export: it has already established in an\r\neligible position, a small nucleus of settlers to which others\r\nmay adhere, and thus both communicate and receive the advantages\r\nof society and protection; and it has a town which affords a\r\nconsiderable market for agricultural produce, and of which the\r\ncommanding localities must rapidly increase the extent and\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nCOUNTRY WEST OF THE BLUE MOUNTAINS.\r\n\r\nThe country to the westward of the Blue Mountains ranks next\r\nin contiguity to Sydney, and claims pre-eminence not so much from\r\nany superiority of soil in those parts of it which have been\r\nexplored, as from its amazing extent, and great diversity of\r\nclimate. These mountains, where the road has been made over them,\r\nare fifty-eight miles in breadth; and as the distance from Sydney\r\nto Emu Ford, at which place this road may be said to commence, is\r\nabout forty miles, the beginning of the vast tract of country to\r\nthe westward of them, it will be seen, is ninety-eight miles\r\ndistant from the capital.\r\n\r\nThe road which thus traverses these mountains is by no means\r\ndifficult for waggons, until you arrive at the pass which forms\r\nthe descent into the low country. There it is excessively steep\r\nand dangerous; yet carts and waggons go up and down it\r\ncontinually: nor do I believe that any serious accident has yet\r\noccurred in performing this very formidable undertaking.\r\n\r\nStill the discovery of a safer and more practicable pass would\r\ncertainly be attended with a very beneficial influence on the\r\nfuture progress of colonization in this great western wilderness.\r\nEvery attempt, however, to find such a one has hitherto proved\r\nabortive; and should the future efforts which may be made with\r\nthis view prove equally so, there can be little doubt, that the\r\ncommunication between the eastern and western country will be\r\nprincipally maintained by means of horses and mules with packs\r\nand panniers.\r\n\r\nThe elevation of these mountains above the level of the sea,\r\nhas not yet been determined; but I should imagine that it cannot\r\nexceed four thousand feet. For the first ten or twelve miles they\r\nare tolerably well clothed with timber, and produce occasionally\r\nsome middling pasture; but beyond this they are excessively\r\nbarren, and are covered generally with a thick brush,\r\ninterspersed here and there with a few miserable stunted gums.\r\nThey bear, in fact, a striking similarity, both in respect to\r\ntheir soil and productions, to the barren wastes on the coast of\r\nPort Jackson. They are very rocky, but they want granite, the\r\ndistinguishing characteristic of primitive mountains. Sandstone\r\nthickly studded with quartz and a little freestone, are the only\r\nvarieties which they offer; a circumstance the more singular, as\r\nthe moment you descend into the low country beyond them, granite\r\nis the only sort of stone that is to be met with for upwards of\r\ntwo hundred miles.\r\n\r\nFor the whole of this distance to the westward of these\r\nmountains, the country abounds with the richest herbage, and is\r\nupon the whole tolerably well supplied with running water. In the\r\nimmediate vicinity of them there is a profusion of rivulets,\r\nwhich discharge themselves into the western river; or, as it is\r\ntermed by the natives, the Warragambia, the main branch, as I\r\nhave before observed, of the Hawkesbury. From the moment,\r\nhowever, that the streams begin to take a western course, the\r\nwant of water becomes more perceptible, and increases as you\r\nproceed into the interior, particularly in a south-west\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nThis large and fertile tract of country, is in general\r\nperfectly free from underwood; and in many places, is without any\r\ntimber at all. Bathurst Plains, for instance, where there is a\r\ncommandant, a military depot, and some few settlers established,\r\nhave been found by actual admeasurement, to contain upwards of\r\nsixty thousand acres, upon which there is scarcely a tree. The\r\nwhole of this western country, indeed, is much more open and free\r\nfrom timber than the best districts to the eastward of the Blue\r\nMountains.\r\n\r\nThe depot at Bathurst Plains, is 180 miles distant from\r\nSydney; and the road to it presents no impediment to waggons, but\r\nthe descent from the mountains into the low country; and even\r\nthis does not prevent the inhabitants from maintaining a regular\r\nintercourse with that town, and receiving from it all the\r\nsupplies which they require. The difficulty, however, of thus\r\ncommunicating with the capital, is such as to preclude this vast\r\ntract of country from assuming an agricultural character; except\r\nin as far as the raising of grain for a scanty population of\r\nshepherds and herdsmen, may entitle it to this denomination;\r\nsince there are no navigable rivers, at all events for many\r\nhundred miles into the interior, and the difficulty and expence\r\nof a land-carriage across the Blue Mountains, will always prevent\r\nthe inhabitants of that part of this vast western wilderness,\r\nwhich is at present explored, from entering into a competition\r\nwith the colonists in the immediate vicinity of Port Jackson. By\r\nway, however, of set-off against the anifest superiority, which\r\nthe districts to the eastward of the mountains possess in this\r\nrespect over the country to the westward of them; this latter is\r\ncertainly much better adapted for all the purposes of grazing and\r\nrearing cattle. The herbage is sweeter and more nutritive, and\r\nthere is an unlimited range for stock, without any danger of\r\ntheir committing trespass. There is besides, for the first two\r\nhundred miles, a constant succession of hill and dale, admirably\r\nsuited for the pasture of sheep, the wool of which will without\r\ndoubt eventually become the principal export of this colony, and\r\nmay be conveyed across these mountains at an inconsiderable\r\nexpense.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of this vast and as yet imperfectly known tract\r\nof country, was made in the year 1814, and will doubtless be\r\nhereafter productive of the most important results. It has indeed\r\nalready given a new aspect to the colony, and will form at some\r\nfuture day, a memorable era in its history. Nothing is now\r\nwanting to render this great western wilderness the seat of a\r\npowerful community, but the discovery of a navigable river\r\ncommunicating with the western coast. That such exists, although\r\nthe search for it has hitherto proved ineffectual, there can be\r\nno doubt, if we may be allowed to judge from analogy; since in\r\nthe whole compass of the earth, there is no single instance of so\r\nlarge a country as New Holland, not possessing at least one great\r\nnavigable river. To ascertain this point has been one of the\r\nleading objects of Governor Macquarie's administration, ever\r\nsince the discovery of the pass across the mountains. Several\r\nunsuccessful expeditions have been fitted out with this view from\r\nSydney, both by sea and land. The last of which we have learned\r\nthe result, was conducted by Mr. Oxley, the surveyor-general, and\r\nis most worthy of notice, as well from the extent of country\r\nwhich he traversed, as from the probability that the river which\r\nhe discovered, discharges itself into the ocean on some part of\r\nthe western coast. The summary of this journey is contained in\r\nthe following letter, addressed by him to the governor on his\r\nreturn from this expedition to Bathurst Plains.\r\n\r\n_Bathurst, 30th August_, 1817.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nI have the honour to acquaint your Excellency with my arrival\r\nat this place last evening, with the persons comprising the\r\nexpedition to the westward, which your Excellency was pleased to\r\nplace under my direction.\r\n\r\nYour Excellency is already informed of my proceedings up to\r\nthe 30th of April. The limits of a letter will not permit me to\r\nenter at large into the occurrences of nineteen weeks; and as I\r\nshall have the honour of waiting on your Excellency in a few\r\ndays, I trust you will have the goodness to excuse the summary\r\naccount I now offer to your Excellency.\r\n\r\nI proceeded down the Lachlan in company with the boats until\r\nthe 12th of May, the country rapidly descending until the waters\r\nof the river rose to a level with it, and dividing into numerous\r\nbranches, inundated the country to the west and north-west, and\r\nprevented any further progress in that direction, the river\r\nitself being lost among marshes: up to this point it had received\r\nno accession of waters from either side, but on the contrary was\r\nconstantly dissipating in lagoons and swamps.\r\n\r\nThe impossibility of proceeding further in conjunction with\r\nthe boats being evident, I determined upon maturer deliberation,\r\nto haul them up, and divesting ourselves of everything, that\r\ncould possibly be spared, proceed with the horses loaded with the\r\nadditional provisions from the boats, in such a course towards\r\nthe coast as would intersect any stream that might arise from the\r\ndivided waters of the Lachlan.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of this plan, I quitted the river on the 11th\r\nMay, taking a south-west course towards Cape Northumberland, as\r\nthe best one to answer my intended purpose. I will not here\r\ndetail the difficulties and privations we experienced in passing\r\nthrough a barren and desolate country, without any water but such\r\nrain water as was found remaining in holes and the crevices of\r\nrocks. I continued this course until the 9th of June, when having\r\nlost two horses through fatigue and want, and the others in a\r\ndeplorable condition, I changed our course to north, along a\r\nrange of lofty hills, running in that direction, as they afforded\r\nthe only means of procuring water until we should fall in with\r\nsome running stream. On this course I continued until the 23d of\r\nJune, when we again fell in with a stream, which we had at first\r\nsome difficulty to recognise as the Lachlan, it being little\r\nlarger than one of the marshes of it, where it was quitted on the\r\n17th of May.\r\n\r\nI did not hesitate a moment to pursue this course; not that\r\nthe nature of the country, or its own appearance in any manner\r\nindicated that it would become navigable, or was even permanent;\r\nbut I was unwilling that the smallest doubt should remain of any\r\nnavigable waters falling westward into the sca, between the\r\nlimits pointed out in my instructions.\r\n\r\nI continued along the banks of the stream until the 8th of\r\nJuly, it having taken during this period a westerly direction,\r\nand passing through a perfectly level country, barren in the\r\nextreme, and being evidently at periods entirely under water. To\r\nthis point it had been gradually diminishing, and spreading its\r\nwaters over stagnated lagoons and morasses, without receiving any\r\nstream that we knew of during the whole extent of its course. The\r\nbanks were not more than three feet high, and the marks of flood\r\nin the shrubs and bushes, shewed that at times it rose between\r\ntwo and three feet higher, causing the whole country to become a\r\nmarsh, and altogether uninhabitable.\r\n\r\nFurther progress westward, had it been possible, was now\r\nuseless, as there was neither hill nor rising ground of any kind\r\nwithin the compass of our view, which was only bounded by the\r\nhorizon in every quarter, entirely devoid of timber except a few\r\ndiminutive gums on the very edge of the stream, might be so\r\ntermed. The water in the bed of the lagoon, as it might now be\r\nproperly denominated, was stagnant; its breadth about twenty\r\nfeet, and the heads of grass growing in it, shewed it to be about\r\nthree feet deep.\r\n\r\nThis originally unlooked for and truly singular termination of\r\na river, which we had anxiously hoped and reasonably expected\r\nwould have led to a far different conclusion, filled us with the\r\nmost painful sensations. We were full five hundred miles west of\r\nSydney, and nearly in its latitude; and it had taken us ten weeks\r\nof unremitted exertion to proceed so far. The nearest part of the\r\ncoast about Cape Bernouilli, had it been accessible, was distant\r\nabout a hundred and fifty miles. We had demonstrated beyond the\r\nshadow of a doubt, that no river whatever could fall into the\r\nsea, between Cape Otway and Spencer's Gulph; at least none\r\nderiving their waters from the eastern coast, and that the\r\ncountry south of the parallel of 34 degrees, and west of the\r\nmeridian of 147 degrees 30' East, was uninhabitable and useless\r\nfor all the purposes of civilized man.\r\n\r\nIt now became my duty to make our remaining resources as\r\nextensively useful to the colony as our circumstances would\r\nallow: these were much diminished: an accident to one of the\r\nboats, in the outset of the expedition, had deprived us of\r\none-third of our dry provisions, of which we had originally but\r\neighteen weeks; and we had been in consequence for some time on a\r\nreduced ration of two quarts of flour per man, per week. To\r\nreturn to the depot by the route we had come, would have been as\r\nuseless as impossible; and seriously considering the spirit of\r\nyour Excellency's instructions, I determined upon the most mature\r\ndeliberation, to take such a route on our return, as would, I\r\nhope, best comport with your Excellency's views, had our present\r\nsituation ever been contemplated.\r\n\r\nReturning down the Lachlan, I re-commenced the survey of it\r\nfrom the point in which it was made, the 23d of June; intending\r\nto continue up its banks until its connection with the marshes,\r\nwhere we quitted it on the 17th May, was satisfactorily\r\nestablished, as also to ascertain if any streams might have\r\nescaped our research. The connection with all the points of the\r\nsurvey previously ascertained, was completed between the 19th of\r\nJuly and the 3d of August. In the space passed over within that\r\nperiod, the river had divided into various branches, and formed\r\nthree fine lakes, which, with one near the determination of our\r\njourney westward, were the only considerable pieces of water we\r\nhad yet seen; and I now estimated that the river, from the place\r\nwhere first made by Mr. Evans, had run a course, taking all its\r\nwindings, of upwards of twelve hundred miles; a length of course\r\naltogether unprecedented, when the _single_ nature of the\r\nriver is considered, and that its _original_ is its\r\n_only_ supply of water during that distance.\r\n\r\nCrossing at this point it was my intention to take a\r\nnorth-east course, to intersect the country, and if possible\r\nascertain what had become of the Macquarie river, which it was\r\nclear had never joined the Lachlan. This course led us through a\r\ncountry to the full as bad as any we had yet seen, and equally\r\ndevoid of water, the want of which again much distressed us. On\r\nthe 7th of August the scene began to change, and the country to\r\nassume a very different aspect: we were now quitting the\r\nneighbourhood of the Lachlan, and had passed to the north-east of\r\nthe high range of hills, which on this parallel bounds the low\r\ncountry to the north of that river. To the north-west and north,\r\nthe country was high and open, with good forest land; and on the\r\n10th we had the satisfaction to fall in with the first stream\r\nrunning northerly. This renewed our hopes of soon falling in with\r\nthe Macquarie, and we continued upon the same course,\r\noccasionally inclining to the eastward, until the 19th passing\r\nthrough a fine luxuriant country, well watered, crossing in that\r\nspace of time _nine_ streams, having a northerly course\r\nthrough rich vallies; the country in every direction being\r\nmoderately high and open, and generally as fine as can be\r\nimagined.\r\n\r\nNo doubt remained upon our minds that those streams fell into\r\nthe Macquarie, and to view it before it received such an\r\naccession, was our first wish. On the 19th we were gratified by\r\nfalling in with a river running through a most beautiful country,\r\nand which I would have been well contented to have believed the\r\nriver we were in search of. Accident led us down this stream\r\nabout a mile, when we were surprised by its junction with a river\r\ncoming from the south, of such width and magnitude, as to dispel\r\nall doubts as to this last being the river we had so long\r\nanxiously looked for. Short as our resources were, we could not\r\nresist the temptation this beautiful country offered us, to\r\nremain two days on the junction of the river, for the purpose of\r\nexamining the vicinity to as great an extent as possible.\r\n\r\nOur examination increased the satisfaction we had previously\r\nfelt: as far as the eye could reach in every direction, a rich\r\nand picturesque country extended, abounding in limestone, slate,\r\ngood timber, and every other requisite that could render an\r\n_uncultivated_ country desirable. The soil cannot be\r\nexcelled, whilst a noble river of _the first magnitude_\r\naffords the means of conveying its productions from one part to\r\nthe other. Where I quitted it its course was northerly, and we\r\nwere then north of the parallel of Port Stevens, being in\r\nlatitude 32 degrees 45' South, and 148 degrees 58' East\r\nlongitude.\r\n\r\nIt appeared to me that the Macquarie had taken a north\r\nnorth-west course from Bathurst, and that it must have received\r\nimmense accessions of water in its course from that place. We\r\nviewed it at a period best calculated to form an accurate\r\njudgment of its importance, when it was neither swelled by floods\r\nbeyond its natural and usual height, nor contracted within its\r\nlimits by summer droughts: of its magnitude when it should have\r\nreceived the streams we had crossed, independent of any it may\r\nreceive from the east, which from the boldness and height of the\r\ncountry, I presume, must be at least as many, some idea may be\r\nformed, when at this point it exceeded in breadth and apparent\r\ndepth, the Hawkesbury at Windsor. Many of the branches were of\r\ngrander and more extended proportion than the admired one on the\r\nNepean River from the Warragambia to Emu Plains.\r\n\r\nResolving to keep as near the river as possible during the\r\nremainder of our course to Bathurst, and endeavour to ascertain\r\nat least on the west side, what waters fell into it, on the 22d\r\nwe proceeded up the river, and between the point quitted and\r\nBathurst, crossed the sources of numberless streams, all running\r\ninto the Macquarie; two of them were nearly as large as that\r\nriver itself at Bathurst. The country from whence all these\r\nstreams derive their source, was mountainous and irregular, and\r\nappeared equally so on the east side of the Macquarie. This\r\ndescription of country extended to the immediate vicinity of\r\nBathurst; but to the west of those lofty ranges, the country was\r\nbroken into low grassy hills, and fine valleys watered by\r\nrivulets rising on the west side of the mountains, which on their\r\neastern side pour their waters directly into the Macquarie.\r\n\r\nThese westerly streams appeared to me to join that which I had\r\nat first sight taken for the Macquarie; and when united fall into\r\nit at the point at which it was first discovered, on the 19th\r\ninst.\r\n\r\nWe reached this place last evening, without a single accident\r\nhaving occurred during the whole progress of the expedition,\r\nwhich from this point has encircled within the parallels of 34\r\ndegrees 30' South, and 32 degrees South, and between the\r\nmeridians of 149 degrees 43' and 143 degrees 40' East, a space of\r\nnearly one thousand miles.\r\n\r\nI shall hasten to lay before your Excellency the journals,\r\ncharts, and drawings, explanatory of the various occurrences of\r\nour diversified route; infinitely gratified if our exertions\r\nshould appear to your Excellency commensurate with your\r\nexpectations, and the ample means which your care and liberality\r\nplaced at my disposal.\r\n\r\nI feel the most particular pleasure in informing your\r\nExcellency of the obligations I am under to Mr. Evans, the Deputy\r\nSurveyor, for his able advice and cordial co-operation throughout\r\nthe expedition, and as far as his previous researches had\r\nextended, the accuracy and fidelity of his narration was fully\r\nexemplified.\r\n\r\nIt would perhaps appear presuming in me to hazard an opinion\r\nupon the merits of persons engaged in a pursuit of which I have\r\nlittle knowledge; the extensive and valuable collection of plants\r\nformed by Mr. A. Cunningham, the king's botanist, and Mr. C.\r\nFrazer, the colonial botanist, will best evince to your\r\nExcellency the unwearied industry and zeal bestowed on the\r\ncollection and preservation of them: in every other respect they\r\nalso merit the highest praise.\r\n\r\nFrom the nature of the greater part of the country passed\r\nover, our mineralogical collection is but small. Mr. S. Parr did\r\nas much as could be done in that branch, and throughout\r\nendeavoured to render himself as useful as possible.\r\n\r\nOf the men on whom the chief care of the horses and baggage\r\ndevolved, it is impossible to speak in too high terms. Their\r\nconduct in periods of considerable privation, was such as must\r\nredound to their credit; and their orderly, regular, and obedient\r\nbehaviour, could not be exceeded. It may be principally\r\nattributed to their care and attention that we lost only three\r\nhorses; and that, with the exception of the loss of the dry\r\nprovisions already mentioned, no other accident happened during\r\nthe course of it. I most respectfully beg leave to recommend them\r\nto your Excellency's favourable notice.\r\n\r\nI trust your Excellency will have the goodness to excuse any\r\nomissions or inaccuracies that may appear in this letter; the\r\nmessenger setting out immediately will not allow me to revise or\r\ncorrect it.\r\n\r\nI have the honour, etc.\r\n\r\nJ. OXLEY, Surveyor-Gen.\r\n\r\nTo his Excellency Lachlan Macquarie, Esq.\r\n\r\nThe course and direction of this river is the object of two\r\nexpeditions, of which we may shortly expect to learn the result.\r\nOne is by land, and conducted by the same gentleman; the other by\r\nsea, and under the command of Lieutenant King, R.N.; whose\r\nfather, Captain King, was formerly Lieutenant Governor of Norfolk\r\nIsland, and afterwards Governor in Chief of New South Wales.\r\n\r\nIf the sanguine hopes to which the discovery of this river has\r\ngiven birth, should be realized, and it should be found to empty\r\nitself into the ocean, on the north-west coast, which is the only\r\npart of this vast island that has not been accurately surveyed,\r\nin what mighty conceptions of the future greatness and power of\r\nthis colony, may we not reasonably indulge? The nearest distance\r\nfrom the point at which Mr. Oxley left off, to any part of the\r\nwestern coast, is very little short of two thousand miles. If\r\nthis river, therefore, be already of the size of the Hawkesbury\r\nat Windsor, which is not less than two hundred and fifty yards in\r\nbreadth, and of sufficient depth to float a seventy-four\r\ngun-ship, it is not difficult to imagine what must be its\r\nmagnitude at its confluence with the ocean; before it can arrive\r\nat which it has to traverse a country nearly two thousand miles\r\nin extent. If it possess the usual sinuosities of rivers, its\r\ncourse to the sea cannot be less than from five to six thousand\r\nmiles, and the endless accession of tributary streams which it\r\nmust receive in its passage through so great an extent of\r\ncountry, will without doubt enable it to vie in point of\r\nmagnitude with any river in the world. In this event its\r\ninfluence in promoting the progress of population in this fifth\r\ncontinent, will be prodigious, and in all probability before the\r\nexpiration of many years, give an entirely new impulse to the\r\ntide of population: and here it may not be altogether irrelevant,\r\nto enter into a short disquisition on the natural superiority\r\npossessed by those countries which are most abundantly\r\nintersected with navigable rivers. That such are most favourable\r\nfor all the purposes of civilized man, the history of the world\r\naffords the most satisfactory proof There is not, in fact, a\r\nsingle instance on record of any remarkable degree of wealth and\r\npower having been attained by any nation which has not possessed\r\nfacilities for commerce, either in the number or size of its\r\nrivers, or in the spaciousness of its harbours, and the general\r\ncontiguity of its provinces to the sea. The Mediterranean has\r\ngiven rise to so many great and powerful nations, only from the\r\nsuperior advantages which it afforded for commerce during the\r\nlong infancy of navigation. The number and fertility of its\r\nislands, the serenity of its climate, the smoothness of its\r\nwaters, the smallness of its entrance, which although of itself\r\nsufficient to indicate to the skilful pilot the proximity of the\r\nocean, is still more clearly defined by the Pillars of Hercules,\r\ntowering on each side of it, and forming land-marks not to be\r\nmistaken by the timid, the inexperienced, or the bewildered. Such\r\nare the main causes why the Mediterranean continued until the\r\ndiscovery and application of the properties of the magnet, the\r\nseat of successive empires so superior to the rest of the world\r\nin affluence and power. It is indeed almost impossible to\r\nconceive, how any considerable degree of wealth and civilization\r\ncan be acquired without the aid of navigation. From the moment\r\nsavages abandon the hunter state, and resign themselves to the\r\nsettled pursuits of agriculture, the march of population must\r\ninevitably follow the direction of navigable waters; since in the\r\ninfancy of societies these furnish the only means of indulging\r\nthat spirit of barter which is co-existent with association, is\r\nthe main spring of industry, and the ultimate cause of all\r\ncivilization and refinement. In such situations the rude canoe\r\nabundantly suffices to maintain the first necessary interchanges\r\nof the superfluities of one individual for those of another.\r\nRoads, waggons, etc. are refinements entirely unknown in the\r\nincipient stages of society. They are the gradual results of\r\ncivilization, and consequent only on the accumulation of wealth\r\nand the attainment of a certain point of maturity. Canals are a\r\nstill later result of civilization, and are undoubtedly the\r\ngreatest efforts for the encouragement of barter, and the\r\ndevelopement of industry, to which human power and ingenuity have\r\nyet given birth. But after all, what are these artificial\r\nchannels of communication, these _ne plus ultras_ of human\r\ncontrivance, compared with those natural mediums of intercourse,\r\nthose mighty rivers which pervade every quarter of the globe?\r\nWhat are they to the Danube, the Nile, the Ganges, the\r\nMississippi, or the Amazon? What are they, in fact, compared even\r\nwith those infinite minor navigable streams, of which scarcely\r\nany country, however circumscribed, is entirely destitute? What!\r\nbut mere pigmy imitations of nature, which wherever there is a\r\nsufficient number of rivers, will never be resorted to, unless it\r\nbe for the purpose of connecting them together, or of avoiding\r\nthose long and tedious sinuosities to which they are _all_\r\nmore or less subject.\r\n\r\nViewing therefore this newly discovered river only in the\r\nlight of a river of the first magnitude, it must be evident that\r\nthis important discovery will have an incalculable influence on\r\nthe future progress of colonization; but to be enabled fully to\r\nestimate the beneficial consequences of which it will be\r\nproductive; it is essential to take into the estimate, the\r\nprobable direction of its course, and the point of its confluence\r\nwith the ocean. This I have already stated is with good reason\r\nimagined to be on the north-west coast; since every other part of\r\nthis vast island has been so accurately surveyed, as scarcely to\r\nadmit of the possibility of so large a river falling into the sea\r\nin any other position. Assuming, therefore, that the source of\r\nthis river is in the direction thus generally supposed, it will\r\nbe seen that it will surpass all the rivers in the world in\r\nvariety of climate; since reckoning merely from the spot where\r\nMr. Oxley discovered it to its conjectural embouchure, there will\r\nbe a difference of latitude of twenty degrees. Even omitting,\r\nthen, to take into computation the probable length of its course\r\nfrom the place where it first becomes navigable, to the point\r\nwhere that gentleman fell in with it, (and it was there running\r\nfrom the south, and must have already been navigable for a\r\nconsiderable distance, if we may judge from its size,) the world\r\ndoes not afford any parallel of a river traversing so great a\r\ndiversity of climate. The majority indeed of the rivers, which\r\nmay be termed \"rivers of the first magnitude,\" run from west to\r\neast, or from east to west, and consequently vary their climate\r\nonly in proportion to their distance from the sea, to the\r\nelevation of their beds, and to the extent of country traversed\r\nby such of their branches as run at right angles with them. Of\r\nthis sort are the St. Lawrence, in North America, the Oronoko and\r\nAmazon, in South America; the Niger, Senegal and Gambia, in\r\nAfrica; the Danube and Elbe, in Europe; and the Hoang Ho, and\r\nKiang Keou in Asia. It must indeed be admitted, that every\r\nquarter of the globe furnishes some striking exceptions to this\r\nrule, such as the Mississippi and River Plate in America; the\r\nNile, in Africa; the Rhine, the Dniester, the Don, and the Volga,\r\nin Europe; and the Indus and Ganges, in Asia; all of which\r\ncertainly run from north to south, or south to north, and\r\nconsequently command a great variety of climate.\r\n\r\nIn this respect, however, none of them will be worthy of\r\ncomparison with this newly discovered river, if the point of its\r\nconfluence with the ocean should happily be where it is\r\nconjectured. And yet we find that all the countries through which\r\nthe above-named rivers pass, either have been, or promise to be,\r\nthe seats of much more wealthy and powerful nations than the\r\ncountries through which those rivers pass whose course is east or\r\nwest. The cause of this superiority of one over the other, is to\r\nbe traced to the greater diversity of productions, which will\r\nnecessarily be raised on the banks and in the vicinity of those\r\nrivers whose course is north or south, a circumstance that is\r\nalone sufficient to ensure the possessors of them, under\r\nGovernments equally favourable to the extension of industry, a\r\nmuch greater share of commerce and wealth than can possibly\r\nbelong to the inhabitants of these rivers whose course is in a\r\ncontrary direction: and this for the simplest reason; because\r\nrivers of the former description contain within themselves, many\r\nof those productions which the latter can only obtain from\r\nabroad. In the one, therefore, there is not only a necessity for\r\nhaving recourse to foreign supply, which does not exist in the\r\nother, but also a great prevention to internal navigation,\r\narising from the sameness of produce, and the consequent\r\nimpediment to barter, which must prevail in a country where all\r\nhave the same commodities to dispose of, where all wish to sell\r\nand none to buy. To this manifest superiority which rivers\r\nrunningon a meridian claim over those running on a parallel,\r\nthere is no counterpoise, since they both contain equal\r\nfacilities for exporting their surplus productions, and receiving\r\nin exchange the superfluities of other countries. It may, indeed,\r\nhere be urged, that there is, upon the whole, no surplus produce\r\nin the world; and that, as the surplus, whatever may be its\r\nextent, of one country, may be always exchanged for that of\r\nanother, as great a variety of luxuries may be thus obtained by\r\nthe inhabitants of rivers that run in an eastern or western\r\ndirection as can possibly be raised by the inhabitants of rivers\r\nthat run in a northern or southern; and that consequently the\r\nsame stimulus to an inland navigation will be created by the\r\neventual distribution of the various commodities procured by\r\nforeign commerce, as if they had been the products of the country\r\nitself. To this it may be replied, that although a much greater\r\nvariety of products may undoubtedly be imported from foreign\r\ncountries, than can possibly be raised within the compass of any\r\none navigable river, such products cannot afterwards be sold at\r\nso cheap a rate. In all countries, therefore, where such products\r\nare imported from abroad, the increase in their price must\r\noccasion a proportionate diminution in their consumption, and in\r\nso far inevitably operate as a check to internal navigation.\r\n\r\nThis variety of production, and the additional encouragement\r\nthus afforded by it, to what is well known to be one of the main\r\nsources of national wealth, is sufficient to account for the\r\nsuperior degree of civilization, affluence, and power, which have\r\nin general characterized those countries whose rivers take a\r\nnorthern or southern course. Some few nations, indeed, which do\r\nnot possess such great natural advantages, have supplied the want\r\nof them by their own skill and industry, and have in the end\r\ntriumphed over the efforts of nature to check their progress. Of\r\na people who have thus overstepped these natural barriers opposed\r\nto their advancement, and in spite of them attained the summit of\r\nwealth and civilization, China perhaps furnishes the most\r\nremarkable example. The two principal rivers of that country, the\r\nHoang Ho, or Yellow River, and the Kiang Keou, or Great River,\r\nruns from west to east; yet by means of what is termed by way of\r\neminence, \"The Great Canal,\" the Chinese have not only joined\r\nthese two mighty streams together, but have also extended the\r\ncommunication to the northward, as far as the main branch of the\r\nPei Ho, and to the southward as far as the mouth of the Ningapo:\r\nthus establishing by the intervention of this stupendous monument\r\nof human industry and perseverance, and the various branches of\r\nthe four rivers which it connects, an inland navigation between\r\nthe great cities of Peking and Nanking, and affording every\r\nfacility for the transport of the infinite products raised within\r\nthe compass of a country containing from twelve to fifteen\r\ndegrees difference of latitude, and about the same difference of\r\nlongitude; or, in other words, a surface of about five hundred\r\nand eighteen thousand four hundred square miles.\r\n\r\nThis instance, however, of equal or superior civilization thus\r\nattained by a nation, notwithstanding the principal rivers of\r\ntheir country run from west to east, does not at all militate\r\nagainst the natural superiority which has been conceded to those\r\ncountries whose rivers run in a contrary direction: it only shews\r\nwhat may be effected by a wise and politic government averse to\r\nthe miseries of war, and steadily bent on the arts of peace. The\r\nvery attempts, indeed, of this enlightened people to supply the\r\nnatural deficiencies of their country by canals, are the\r\nstrongest commendations that can be urged in favour of a country\r\nwhere no such artificial substitutes are necessary; where nature,\r\nof her own lavish bounty has created facilities for the progress\r\nof industry and civilization, which it would require the labour\r\nand maturity of ages imperfectly to imitate.\r\n\r\nHow far, indeed, these mighty contrivances of the\r\nall-bounteous Creator, for the promotion and developement of\r\nindustry, outstrip all human imitation, the occurrences of the\r\npassing hour furnish the most satisfactory and conclusive\r\nevidence. The vast tide of emigration which is incessantly\r\nrolling along the banks of the Mississippi, and of its tributary\r\nstreams, and the numberless cities, towns, and settlements, that\r\nhave sprung up as if it were by the agency of magic, in what but\r\na few years back was one boundless and uninterrupted wilderness,\r\nspeak a language not to be mistaken by the most ignorant or\r\nprejudiced. The western territory, which though a province but of\r\nyesterday, soon promises to rival the richest and most powerful\r\nmembers of the American union, affords an instance of rapid\r\ncolonization, of which, the history of the world cannot produce a\r\nparallel, and offers an incontestable proof of the natural\r\nsuperiority which countries, whose rivers run in a northern or\r\nsouthern course, possess over all others.\r\n\r\nBut this fact is not merely established by the experience of\r\nthe present day, it is equally authenticated by the testimony of\r\npast ages. What was the reason why Egypt was for so many\r\ncenturies the seat of affluence and power, but the Nile? that\r\nIndia is still rich and populous, but the Indus and Ganges? These\r\ncountries, indeed, are no longer the great and powerful empires\r\nthey were, although the natural advantages of their situations\r\nare still unchanged. But what mighty ravages will not a\r\nblood-thirsty and overwhelming despotism effect? What health and\r\nvigor can belong to that body politic which is forced to inhale\r\nthe nauseous effluvia of tyranny? Prosperity is a plant that can\r\nonly flourish in an atmosphere fauned by the wholesome breath of\r\nfreedom. The highest fertility of soil, the greatest benignity of\r\nclimate, the most commanding superiority of position, will\r\notherwise be unavailing. Freedom may in the end convert the most\r\nbarren and inhospitable waste into a paradise; but the inevitable\r\nresult of tyranny is desolation.\r\n\r\nThe probable course of this newly discovered river, being thus\r\nin every respect so decidedly favourable for the foundation of a\r\nrich and powerful community, there can be little doubt that the\r\ngovernment of this country will immediately avail itself of the\r\nadvantages which it presents, and establish a settlement at its\r\nmouth. What a sublime spectacle will it then be for the\r\nphilosopher to mark the gradual progress of population from the\r\ntwo extremities of this river; to behold the two tides of\r\ncolonization flowing in opposite directions, and constantly\r\nhastening to that junction, of which the combined waters shall\r\noverspread the whole of this fifth continent!\r\n\r\nWhat a cheering prospect for the philanthropist to behold what\r\nis now one vast and mournful wilderness, becoming the smiling\r\nseat of industry and the social arts; to see its hills and dales\r\ncovered with bleating flocks, lowing herds, and waving corn; to\r\nhear the joyful notes of the shepherd, and the enlivening cries\r\nof the husbandman, instead of the appalling yell of the savage,\r\nand the plaintive howl of the wolf; and to witness a country\r\nwhich nature seems to have designed as her master-piece, at\r\nlength fulfilling the gracious intentions of its all-bounteous\r\nAuthor, by administering to the wants and contributing to the\r\nhappiness of millions.\r\n\r\nWhat a proud sight for the Briton to view his country pouring\r\nforth her teeming millions to people new hives, to see her\r\nforming in the most remote parts of the earth new establishments\r\nwhich may hereafter rival her old; and to behold thousands who\r\nwould perish from want within her immediate limits, procuring an\r\neasy and comfortable subsistence in those which are more remote;\r\nand instead of weakening her power and diminishing her resources,\r\neffectually contributing to the augmentation of both, and forming\r\nmonuments which may descend to the latest posterity,\r\nindestructible records of her greatness and glory.\r\n\r\nSYSTEM OF AGRICULTURE.\r\n\r\nThe system of agriculture pursued in this colony, does not\r\nmaterially differ from that which prevails in this country.\r\nDuring the earlier stages of these settlements, the hoe-husbandry\r\nwas a necessary evil; but the great increase in the stock of\r\nhorses and cattle, has at last almost completely superseded it;\r\nand the plough-husbandry is now, and has been for many years\r\npast, in general practice. In new lands, indeed, the hoe is still\r\nunavoidably used during the first year of their cultivation, on\r\naccount of the numerous roots and other impediments to the\r\nplough, with which lands in a state of nature invariably abound;\r\nbut excepting these occasions, and the instances of settlers who\r\nare unable to purchase horses or oxen, and consequently adhere to\r\nthe original mode of cultivation from necessity, the\r\nhoe-husbandry is completely exploded. Until the year 1803,\r\neighteen years after the foundation of this colony, the\r\nplough-husbandry was confined to a few of the richest\r\ncultivators, from the exorbitant price of cattle. At that period,\r\nhowever, the government herds had so considerably multiplied,\r\nthat the then governor (King) recommended the adoption of the\r\nplough-husbandry in general orders, and tendered oxen at\r\n£28 per head, to be paid either in produce or money, at the\r\nend of three years, to all such settlers as were inclined to\r\npurchase them. This custom has been followed by all his\r\nsuccessors; but as no abatement has been made in the price of\r\nthem, and as they can be obtained at one-third the amount\r\nelsewhere, such only of the colonists now avail themselves of\r\nthis indulgence, as have no ready means of purchase, and are\r\nallured by the length of the credit.\r\n\r\nWheat, maize, barley, oats, and rye, are all grown in this\r\ncolony; but the two former are most cultivated. The climate\r\nappears to be rather too warm for the common species of barley\r\nand oats; but the poorer soils produce them of a tolerably good\r\nquality. The skinless barley, or as it is termed by some, the\r\nSiberian wheat, arrives at very great perfection, and is in every\r\nrespect much superior to the common species of barley; but the\r\nculture of this grain is limited to the demand which is created\r\nfor it by the colonial breweries; the Indian corn, or maize,\r\nbeing much better adapted for the food of horses, oxen, pigs, and\r\npoultry. The produce too is much more abundant than that of\r\nbarley and oats; and the season for planting it being two months\r\nlater than for any other sort of grain, the settler has every\r\nmotive for giving it the preference. Wheat may be sown any time\r\nfrom February to July, and even as late as August, if that month\r\nhappens to be moist; but the best months are April, May, and\r\nJune. The creeping wheat, however, may be sown in the\r\ncommencement of February; as should it become too rank, it can\r\neasily be kept down by sheep, which are found to do this sort of\r\nwheat no manner of injury. To the farmer, therefore, who keeps\r\nlarge flocks of sheep, the cultivation of the creeping wheat is\r\nhighly advantageous; since in addition to its yielding as great a\r\ncrop as any other species of wheat, it supersedes the necessity\r\nof growing turnips or other artificial food for the support of\r\nhis stock during the severity of the winter, when the natural\r\ngrasses become scanty and parched up by the frost. The red and\r\nwhite lammas, and the Cape or bearded wheat, are the species\r\ngenerally cultivated. June is the best month for sowing barley\r\nand oats, but they may be sown till the middle of August with a\r\nfair prospect of a good crop. Indian corn or maize may be planted\r\nfrom the end of September to the middle of December; but October\r\nis the best month. It is, however, a very common practice among\r\nthe settlers on the fertile banks of the Hawkesbury and Nepean,\r\nto plant what is called stubble corn; that is, to plant it among\r\nthe wheat, barley, and oat stubbles, as soon as the harvest is\r\nover, without ploughing or breaking up the ground. Maize is\r\nfrequently planted in this way until the middle of January, and\r\nif the season proves sufficiently moist, yields a very abundant\r\ncrop. The usual manner of planting it is in holes about six feet\r\napart: five grains are generally put in each of these holes. The\r\naverage produce of this grain on rich flooded lands, is from\r\neighty to a hundred bushels per acre. Wheat in the same\r\nsituations yields from thirty to forty bushels; and barley and\r\noats, about fifty bushels an acre. On forest lands, however, the\r\ncrops are not so productive, unless the ground be well manured;\r\nbut the wheat, barley and oats, grown on this land, are much\r\nheavier and superior in quality. The difference of the weight of\r\nwheat grown in forest and flooded lands, is upon an average not\r\nless than 8 lbs. per bushel. The former sort weighing 64 lbs. and\r\nthe latter only 56 lbs.\r\n\r\nThe wheat harvest commences partially about the middle of\r\nNovember, and is generally over by Christmas. The maize, however,\r\nis not ripe until the end of March, and the gathering is not\r\ncomplete throughout the colony before the middle of May.\r\n\r\nPotatoes*, cabbages, carrots, parsnips, turnips, pease, beans,\r\ncauliflowers, brocoli, asparagus, lettuces, onions, and in fact\r\nevery species of vegetables known in this country, are produced\r\nin this colony; many of them attain a much superior degree of\r\nperfection, but a few also degenerate. To the former class belong\r\nthe cauliflower and brocoli, and the different varieties of the\r\npea; to the latter the bean and potatoe. For the bean, in\r\nparticular, the climate appears too hot, and it is only to be\r\nobtained in the stiffest clays and the dampest situations. The\r\npotatoe, however, is produced on all soils in the greatest\r\nabundance, but the quality is not nearly as good as in this\r\ncountry. In this respect, however, much depends on the nature of\r\nthe soil. In stiff clays the potatoes are invariably watery and\r\nwaxy, but in light sands and loams, they are tolerably dry and\r\nmealy. Manure also deteriorates their quality, and in general\r\nthey are best when grown on new lands. Potatoes are in\r\nconsequence very commonly planted in the fields, as a first crop,\r\nand are found to pulverize land just brought from a state of\r\nnature into cultivation more than other root. An abundant crop of\r\nwheat, barley, or oats, may be safely calculated to succeed them;\r\nmore particularly if a light covering of manure be applied at the\r\ntime of their planting.\r\n\r\n[* For the Colonial Garden, see\r\nAppendix.]\r\n\r\nThe colony is justly famed for the goodness and variety of its\r\nfruits: Peaches, apricots, nectarines, oranges, grapes, pears,\r\nplums, figs, pomegranates, raspberries, strawberries, and melons\r\nof all sorts, attain the highest degree of maturity in the open\r\nair; and even the pineapple may be produced merely by the aid of\r\nthe common forcing glass. The climate, however, of Port Jackson,\r\nis not altogether congenial to the growth of the apple, currant,\r\nand gooseberry; although the whole of these fruits are produced\r\nthere, and the apple, in particular, in very great abundance; but\r\nit is decidedly inferior in quality to the apple of this country.\r\nThese fruits, however, arrive at the greatest perfection in every\r\npart of Van Diemen's Land; and as the climate of the country to\r\nthe westward of the Blue Mountains, is equally cold, they will\r\nwithout doubt attain there an equal degree of perfection; but the\r\nshort period which has elapsed since the establishment of a\r\nsettlement beyond these mountains, has not allowed the\r\nnltramontanians to make the experiment.\r\n\r\nOf all the fruits which I have thus enumerated as being\r\nproduced in this colony, the peach is the most abundant and the\r\nmost useful. The different varieties which have been already\r\nintroduced, succeed one another in uninterrupted succession from\r\nthe middle of November to the latter end of March: thus filling\r\nup an interval of more than four months, and affording a\r\nwholesome and nutritious article of food during one-third of the\r\nyear. This fruit grows spontaneously in every situation, on the\r\nrichest soils, as on the most barren; and its growth is so rapid\r\nthat if you plant a stone, it will in three years afterwards bear\r\nan abundant crop of fruit. Peaches are, in consequence, so\r\nplentiful throughout the colony, that they are every where given\r\nas food to hogs; and when thrown into heaps, and allowed to\r\nundergo a proper degree of fermentation, are found to fatten them\r\nvery rapidly. Cider also is made in great quantities from this\r\nfruit, and when of sufficient age, affords a very pleasant and\r\nwholesome beverage. The lees, too, after the extraction of the\r\njuice, possess the same fattening properties, and are equally\r\ncalculated as food for hogs.\r\n\r\nREARING OF CATTLE, ETC.\r\n\r\nThe system of rearing and fattening stock in this colony is\r\nsimple and economical. Horses, in consequence of their rambling\r\nnature, are almost invariably kept in enclosures. In the\r\ndistricts immediately contiguous to Port Jackson, horned cattle\r\nare followed by a herdsman during the day, in order to prevent\r\nthem from trespassing on the numerous uninclosed tracts of land\r\nthat are in a state of tillage, and they are confined during the\r\nnight in yards or paddocks. In the remoter districts, however,\r\nwhich are altogether devoid of cultivation, horned cattle are\r\nsubjected to no such restraints, but are permitted to range about\r\nthe country at all times. The herds too are generally larger; and\r\nalthough a herdsman is still required as well to prevent them\r\nfrom separating into straggling parties, as to protect them from\r\ndepredation, the expence of keeping them in this manner is\r\ncomparatively trifling, and the advantages of allowing them this\r\nuncontrouled liberty to range, very great; since they are found\r\nduring the heat of summer to feed more in the night than in the\r\nday. This, therefore, is the system which the great stockholders\r\nalmost invariably pursue. Few of them possess sufficient land for\r\nthe support of their cattle; and as their estates too, however\r\nremote the situation in which they may have been selected, have\r\nfor the most part become surrounded by small cultivators, who\r\nseldom or ever inclose their crops, they generally recede with\r\ntheir herds from the approach of colonization, and form new\r\nestablishments, where the liability to trespass does not exist.\r\nThey thus become the gradual explorers of the country, and it is\r\nto their efforts to avoid the contact of agriculture, that the\r\ndiscovery of the best districts yet known in the colony is\r\nascribable.\r\n\r\nThe management of sheep is in some respects different. They\r\nare never permitted to roam during the night, on account of the\r\nnative dog, which is a great enemy to them, and sometimes during\r\nthe day, makes great ravages among them, even under the eye of\r\nthe shepherd. In every part of the country, therefore, they are\r\nkept by night either in folds or yards. In the former case the\r\nshepherd sleeps in a small moveable box, which is shifted with\r\nthe folds, and with his faithful dog, affords a sufficient\r\nprotection for his flock, against the attempts of these midnight\r\ndepredators. In the latter the paling of the yards is always made\r\nso high, that the native dog cannot surmount it; and the safety\r\nof the flock is still further ensured by the contiguity of the\r\nshepherd's house, and the numerous dogs with which he is always\r\nprovided.\r\n\r\nThe natural grasses of the colony are sufficiently good and\r\nnutritious at all seasons of the year, for the support of every\r\ndescription of stock, where there is an adequate tract of country\r\nfor them to range over. But in consequence of the complete\r\noccupation of the districts which are in the more immediate\r\nvicinity of Port Jackson, and from the settlers in general\r\npossessing more stock than their lands are capable of\r\nmaintaining, the raising of artificial food for the winter\r\nmonths, has of late years become very general among such of them\r\nas are unwilling to send their flocks and herds into the\r\nuninhabited parts in the interior. This is a practice which must\r\nnecessarily gain ground; since it has been observed, that the\r\ncoldness of the climate keeps pace with the progress of\r\nagriculture. In the more contiguous and cultivated districts, the\r\nnatural grass becomes consequently every year more affected by\r\nthe influence of frost, and the necessity of raising some\r\nartificial substitute for the support of stock, during the\r\nsuspension of vegetation, more pressing and incumbent. It is from\r\nthis increase in the severity of the winters, that the custom of\r\nmaking hay has begun to be adopted; and should the future\r\naugmentation of cold be, as there is every reason to believe,\r\nproportionate to the past, this custom will, before the\r\nexpiration of many years, become generally prevalent. It is\r\nindeed, rather a matter of surprise than otherwise, that so\r\nsalutary a precaution has been so long in disuse; since such is\r\nthe luxuriance of the natural grass during the summer, that it is\r\nthe general practice after the seeds wither away, to set fire to\r\nit, and thus improvidently consume what, if mown and made into\r\nhay, would afford the farmer a sufficiency of nutritious food for\r\nhis stock during the winter, and altogether supersede the\r\nsubsequent necessity for his having recourse to artificial means\r\nof remedying so palpable a neglect of the bounteous gifts of\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nThis custom of setting fire to the grass, is most prevalent\r\nduring the months of August and January, i.e. just before the\r\ncommencement of spring and autumn, when vegetation is on the eve\r\nof starting from the slumber which it experiences alike during\r\nthe extremes of the winter's cold as of the summer's heat. If a\r\nfall of rain happily succeed these fires, the country soon\r\npresents the appearance of a field of young wheat; and however\r\nrepugnant this practice may appear to the English farmer, it is\r\nabsolutely unavoidable in those districts which are not\r\nsufficiently stocked; since cattle of every description refuse to\r\ntaste the grass the moment it becomes withered.\r\n\r\nThe artificial food principally cultivated in the colony are\r\nturnips, tares, and Cape barley; and for those settlers in\r\nparticular who have flocks of breeding sheep, the cultivation of\r\nthem is highly necessary, and contributes materially to the\r\ngrowth and strength of the lambs. On those also who keep dairies,\r\nthis practice of raising artificial food, is equally incumbent;\r\nthe natural grasses being quite insufficient to keep milch cows\r\nin good heart during the winter, when there is the greatest\r\ndemand for butter. Good meat, too, is then only to be had with\r\ndifficulty, and this difficulty is increasing every year. There\r\ncannot, therefore, be any doubt that it would answer the purposes\r\neven of the grazier to have recourse to artificial means of\r\nfattening his stock at that season; since it is then that he\r\nwould be enabled to obtain the readiest and highest price for his\r\nfat cattle.\r\n\r\nPRICE OF CATTLE, ETC.\r\n\r\nThe price of all manner of stock is almost incredibly\r\nmoderate, considering the short period which has elapsed since\r\nthe foundation of the colony. A very good horse for the cart or\r\nplough may be had from £10 to £15, and a better\r\nsaddle or gig horse, from £20 to £30, than could be\r\nobtained in this country for double the money. Very good\r\nmilch-cows may be bought from £5 to £10; working oxen\r\nfor about the same price; and fine young breeding ewes from\r\n£1 to £3, according to the quality of their fleece.\r\nLow as these prices may appear they are in a great measure\r\nfictitious; since there is confessedly more stock of all sorts in\r\nthe colony, than is necessary for its population. It accordingly\r\nfrequently happens, particularly at sales by public auction, that\r\nstock are to be bought for one-half, and even one-third of the\r\nabove prices; and there is every probability that before the\r\nexpiration of ten years, their value will be still more\r\nconsiderably diminished. To be convinced of the truth of this\r\nconjecture, we have only to look back a little into the annals of\r\nthe colony, and see how prodigiously cattle of every description\r\nhave multiplied. By a census taken at the end of the year 1800,\r\n(twelve years after the institution of the colony) the number of\r\nhorses and mares was only 163; of horned cattle, 1024; and of\r\nsheep, 6124. At the end of 1813, the horses and mares had\r\nincreased to 1891; the horned cattle to 21,513, and the sheep to\r\n65,121: and in the month of November, 1817, the last year of\r\nwhich we have received the census, the numbers were as follow:\r\nhorses and mares, 3072; horned cattle, 44,753; sheep, 170,420.\r\nThus it will be perceived, that in the space of seventeen years,\r\nthe stock of horses and mares has increased from 163, their\r\nhighest number for the first twelve years, to 3072; the stock of\r\nhorned cattle, from 1044 to 44,753; and the stock of sheep from\r\n6124 to 170,920. This is of itself an increase great beyond all\r\nordinary computation; and it would appear still more surprising\r\nif we could add to it the immense numbers of cattle and sheep\r\nthat have been slaughtered in the same period, for the supply of\r\nthe king's stores, and for general consumption.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing statement is will be evident, that the\r\nfuture increase in the stock will be still more prodigious, and\r\nstill more considerably outstrip the advance of population. The\r\nprice therefore of cattle, great and rapid as has been its past\r\ndeclension, must annually experience a still further diminution.\r\nOf what will be their probable value in ten years more, it may\r\nenable us to form no very inaccurate estimate, by referring to\r\nwhat it was ten years back. In 1808, a cow and calf were sold by\r\npublic auction for £105, and the price of middling cattle\r\nwas from £80 to £100. A breeding mare was at the same\r\nperiod worth from 150 to 200 guineas, and ewes from £10 to\r\n£20.\r\n\r\nThese immense prices, however, were the result of monopoly,\r\nand consequently in a great measure fictitious; for in 1810, two\r\nyears after this, a herd of fine cattle were sold for £13\r\nper head. This almost incredible reduction in the value of cattle\r\nin so short a period, was occasioned by the supercession of this\r\nmonopoly by the governor, who in the year 1808, was induced, from\r\nthe considerable increase that had taken place in the public\r\nherds, to issue cows at £28 per head, payable in\r\nagricultural produce, to all indiscriminately who chose to\r\npurchase them. Hundreds of them, therefore, at this epoch, were\r\ndistributed among the settlers, and their extreme value insured\r\nthat degree of care and attention from their owners, which was\r\nnaturally followed by a rapid increase, and produced in the short\r\nlapse of two years, that declension of price which would at first\r\nsight appear so astonishing.\r\n\r\nThus it may be perceived, that within the last ten years,\r\nstock of all sorts have decreased in price, from £700 to\r\n£1,000 per cent. and it is not unreasonable to conclude,\r\nthat in ten years hence, they will have experienced at least a\r\nsimilar reduction. Should this conjecture be verified, they will\r\nbe of as little value in the remote parts of the colony, as the\r\nhorses and cattle on the plains of Buenos Ayres, where any person\r\nmay make what use he pleases of the carcase, provided he leaves\r\nbehind him the hide.\r\n\r\nPRICE OF LABOUR.\r\n\r\nThe price of labour is at present very low, and is still\r\nfurther declining in consequence of the demand for it not\r\nequalling the supply. Upon the establishment of the Colonial\r\nBank, and the consequent suppression of that vile medium of\r\ncirculation, termed the colonial currency, between which and\r\nBritish sterling there used to be a difference of value of from\r\n£50 to £100 per cent. the price of labour was fixed\r\nat the rates contained in the following general order, dated the\r\n7th of December, 1816:\r\n\r\n\"In consequence of the recent abolition of all colonial\r\ncurrency, and the introduction and establishment of a sterling\r\ncirculation and consideration in all payments, dealings,\r\ntransactions, contracts, and agreements, within this territory\r\nand its dependencies, his Excellency the Governor having deemed\r\nit expedient to take into consideration the general rates and\r\nprices of labour and wages within the same, as affected by the\r\nalteration of the mode of payments at a sterling rate, or value,\r\nand of the degree, measure, and sterling amount of the same, upon\r\na fair and equitable proportion and modus; and having also\r\nadopted such measures in that respect as seemed best calculated\r\nto fix and make known the same, is pleased hereby to declare,\r\norder, and direct, that in addition to the rations according to\r\nand equal with the government allowance, the sum of ten pounds\r\nsterling per annum to a man convict, and seven pounds sterling to\r\na woman convict, as including the value of the slops allowed, and\r\nthe sum of seven pounds or five pounds ten shillings exclusive of\r\nsuch slops; computed at three pounds per man, and one pound ten\r\nshillings per woman, shall be allowed, claimed, or demandable, or\r\nsuch part or proportion of such sum or sums as shall be equal and\r\naccording to the period and continuance of actual service, and no\r\nmore in respect of yearly wages, and in the same manner as yearly\r\nwages for the extra work and service of any such male or female\r\nconvict respectively, duly assigned to any person or persons, by\r\nor upon the authority of Government.\r\n\r\n\"His Excellency is also pleased further to declare, order and\r\ndirect, that in consideration of the premises, the undermentioned\r\nsums, amounts, and charges, and no more with regard to and upon\r\nthe various denominations of work, labour and services, described\r\nand set forth, shall be allowed, claimed, or demandable within\r\nthis territory and its dependencies in respect thereof\".\r\n\r\n                                                             £   s.  d.\r\n\r\nFor falling forest timber, per acre,                         0   8   0\r\nBurning off ditto, per ditto,                                1   0   0\r\nRooting out, and burning stumps on forest ground, per ditto, 1  10   0\r\nFalling timber on brush ground, per ditto,                   0  12   0\r\nBurning off ditto, per ditto,                                1  10   0\r\nRooting out and burning stumps on ditto, per ditto,          1  17   6\r\nBreaking up new ground, per ditto,                           1   0   0\r\nBreaking up stubble in corn ground, per ditto,               0  10   0\r\nChipping in wheat, per ditto,                                0   6   0\r\nReaping ditto, per ditto,                                    0  10   0\r\nThreshing and cleaning wheat, per bushel,                    0   0   8\r\nHoleing and planting corn, per acre,                         0   5   0\r\nChipping and shelling corn, per ditto,                       0   6   8\r\nPulling and husking ditto, per bushel,                       0   0   4\r\nSplitting pales, (six feet long) per hundred,                0   3   0\r\nDitto, (five feet long) per ditto,                           0   2   6\r\nShingle splitting, per thousand,                             0   7   6\r\nPreparing and putting up morticed railing, five bars, with\r\n two pannels to a rod, and posts sunk two feet in the ground,0   3   0\r\nDitto, ditto, ditto, four bars,                              0   2   6\r\nDitto, ditto, ditto, three bars,                             0   2   0\r\nDitto, ditto, ditto, two bars,                               0   1   9\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rates limited in this order are pretty well proportioned\r\nto the present state of the colony; but the attempt to reduce the\r\nvalue of labour to a permanent standard, further than regards the\r\nconvicts, must evidently be abortive; since labour, like\r\nmerchandize, will rise and fall with the demand which may exist\r\nfor it in the market where it is disposable;--and although the\r\nabove order might prevent the labourer from recovering in the\r\ncolonial courts, a greater price for his labour than is\r\nstipulated in the foregoing schedule, still the moment it becomes\r\nthe interest of the employer to give higher wages, he will do so,\r\nand the discredit attached to the non-performance of a deliberate\r\ncontract will always prevent him from having recourse to the\r\ncourts for avoiding the fulfilment of it. The above rates, it\r\nwill be seen, only refer to the various species of labour\r\nimmediately attached to agriculture. The wages of artificers,\r\nparticularly of such as are most useful in infant societies, are\r\nconsiderably higher: a circumstance which is principally to be\r\nattributed to the practice of selecting from among the convicts\r\nall the best mechanics for the government works. Carpenters,\r\nstone-masons, brick-layers, wheel and plough-wrights,\r\nblack-smiths, coopers, harness-makers, sawyers, shoe-makers,\r\ncabinet-makers; and in fact all the most useful descriptions of\r\nhandicrafts, are consequently in very great demand, and can\r\neasily earn from eight to ten shillings per day.\r\n\r\nThe price of land is entirely regulated by its situation and\r\nquality. So long as four years back, a hundred and fifty acres of\r\nvery indifferent ground, about thre equarters of a mile from\r\nSydney, were sold by virtue of an execution, in lots of twelve\r\nacres each, and averaged £14 per acre. This, however, is\r\nthe highest price that has yet been given for land not situated\r\nin a town. The general value of unimproved forest land, when it\r\nis not heightened by some advantageous locality, as proximity to\r\na town or navigable river, cannot be estimated at more than five\r\nshillings per acre. Flooded land will fetch double that sum. But\r\non the banks of the Hawkesbury, as far as that river is\r\nnavigable, the value of land is considerably greater; that which\r\nis in a state of nature being worth from £3 to £5 per\r\nacre, and that which is in a state of cultivation, from £8\r\nto £10. The latter description rents for twenty and thirty\r\nshillings an acre.\r\n\r\nThe price of provisions, particularly of agricultural produce,\r\nis subject to great fluctuations, and will unavoidably continue\r\nso until proper measures are taken to counteract the calamitous\r\nscarcities at present consequent on the inundations of the\r\nHawkesbury and Nepean. In the year 1806, the epoch of the great\r\nflood, the old and new stacks on the banks of those rivers were\r\nall swept away; and before the commencement of the following\r\nharvest, wheat and maize attained an equal value, and were sold\r\nat £5 and £6 per bushel. Even after the last overflow\r\nof these rivers, in the month of March, 1817, wheat rose towards\r\nthe close of the year, to 31s. per bushel, and maize to 20s., and\r\npotatoes to 32s. 6d. per cwt. although a very considerable supply\r\n(about 20,000 bushels) was immediately furnished by the Derwent\r\nand Port Dalrymple. But for this speedy and salutary succour, the\r\nprice of grain would have been very little short of what it was\r\nin the year 1806; since the whole stock on hand appears, from the\r\nmuster taken between the 6th of October and the 25th of November,\r\nto have only been as follows: wheat, 2405 bushels; maize, 1506.\r\nThis was all the grain that remained in the various settlements\r\nof New South Wales and its dependencies, about a month before any\r\npart of the produce of the harvest could be brought to market;\r\nand when it is considered that this was to administer to the\r\nsupport of 20,379 souls during that period, it will appear truly\r\nastonishing that the prices continued so moderate.\r\n\r\nBy way, however, of counterpoise to these lamentable\r\nscarcities, which in general follow the inundations of the\r\nprincipal agricultural settlements, provisions are very abundant\r\nand cheap in years when the crops have not suffered from flood or\r\ndrought. In such seasons, wheat upon an average sells for 9s. per\r\nbushel; maize for 3s. 6d.; barley for 5s.; oats for 4s. 6d. and\r\npotatoes for 6s. per cwt.\r\n\r\nThe price of meat is not influenced by the same causes, but is\r\non the contrary experiencing a gradual and certain diminution. By\r\nthe last accounts received from the colony, good mutton and beef\r\nwere to be had for 6d. per pound, veal for 8d. and pork for 9d.\r\nWheat was selling in the market at 8s. 8d. per bushel; oats at\r\n4s.; barley at 5s.; maize at 5s. 6d.; potatoes at 8s. per cwt.;\r\nfowls at 4s. 6d. per couple; ducks at 6s. per ditto; geese at 5s.\r\neach; turkies at 7s. 6d. each; eggs at 2s. 6d. per dozen; and\r\nbutter at 2s. 6d. per pound. The price of the best wheaten bread\r\nwas fixed by the assize at 51/4d. for the loaf, weighing 2\r\nlbs.\r\n\r\nThe progress which this colony has made in manufactures has\r\nperhaps never been equalled by any community of such recent\r\norigin. It already contains extensive manufactories of coarse\r\nwoollen cloths, hats, earthenware and pipes, salt, candles, and\r\nsoap. There are also extensive breweries, and tanneries, wheel\r\nand plough-wrights, gig-makers, black-smiths, nail-makers,\r\ntinmen, rope-makers, saddle and harness-makers, cabinet-makers,\r\nand indeed all sorts of mechanics and artificers that could be\r\nrequired in an infant society, where objects of utility are\r\nnaturally in greater demand than articles of luxury. Many of\r\nthese have considerable capitals embarked in their several\r\ndepartments, and manufacture to a considerable extent. Of the\r\nprecise amount, however, of capital invested in the whole of the\r\ncolonial manufactories, I can give no authentic account; but I\r\nshould imagine it cannot be far short of £50,000.\r\n\r\nThe colonists carry on a considerable commerce with this\r\ncountry, the East Indies, and China; but they have scarcely any\r\narticle of export to offer in return for the various commodities\r\nsupplied by those countries. The money expended by the government\r\nfor the support of the convicts, and the pay and subsistence of\r\nthe civil and military establishments, are the main sources from\r\nwhich they derive the means of procuring those articles of\r\nforeign growth and manufacture which are indispensable to\r\ncivilized life. They have, however, at last a staple export,\r\nwhich is rapidly increasing, and promises in a few years to\r\nsuffice for all their wants, and to render them quite independent\r\nof the miserable pittance which is thus afforded them by the\r\nexpenditure of the government: I mean the fleeces of their\r\nflocks, the best of which are found to combine all the qualities\r\nthat constitute the excellence of the Saxon and Spanish wools.\r\nThe sheep-holders in general have at length become sensible of\r\nthe advantage of directing their attention to the improvement of\r\ntheir flocks; and if their exertions be properly seconded by the\r\ncountenance and encouragement of the local government, there can\r\nbe no doubt that the supply of fine wool, which the parent\r\ncountry will before long receive from the colony, will amply\r\nrepay her for the care and expence she has bestowed on it during\r\nthe protracted period of its helpless infancy. The exportation of\r\nthis highly valuable raw material, is as yet but very limited:\r\nlast year it only amounted to about £8000; but when it is\r\nconsidered that in the year 1817, there were 170,420 sheep in the\r\ncolony and its dependent settlements on Van Diemen's Land, and\r\nthat the majority of the sheep-holders are actively employed in\r\ncrossing their flocks with tups of the best Merino breed, it may\r\neasily be conceived what an extensive exportation of fine wool\r\nmay be effected in a few years.\r\n\r\nThe whole annual income of the colonists inhabiting the\r\nvarious settlements in New Holland, cannot be estimated at more\r\nthan £125,000, and the following sub-divisions of it may be\r\ntaken as a very close approximation to the truth:\r\n\r\nMoney expended by the government for the pay and\r\nsubsistence of the civil and military establishments,\r\nand for the support of such of the convicts as are\r\nvictualled from the king's stores,                     £ 80,000\r\nMoney expended by shipping not belonging to the\r\ncolonial merchants,                                    £ 12,000\r\nVarious articles of export collected from the adjacent\r\nseas and islands, by the colonial craft, consisting\r\nprincipally of seal skins, right whale, and elephant\r\noils, and sandal wood,                                 £ 15,000\r\nWool grown in the colony,                              £  8,000\r\nSundries,                                              £ 20,000\r\n                                                       --------\r\nTotal                                                  £125,000\r\n                                                       --------\r\n\r\n\r\nThe imports levied by the authority of the local government\r\nform two distinct funds, one of which, as has been already\r\ncasually mentioned, is called the \"Orphan Fund,\" and the other\r\n\"the Police Fund.\" The former, it has been seen, contains\r\none-eighth of the colonial revenue, and is devoted solely to the\r\npromotion of education among the youth of the colony; the latter\r\ncontains the other seven-eighths, and is appropriated to various\r\npurposes of internal economy; such as the construction and repair\r\nof roads and bridges, the erection of public edifices, the\r\nmaintenance of the police, the cost of criminal prosecutions, and\r\nthe pay of various officers, principally in subordinate\r\ncapacities, who are not borne on the parliamentary estimate of\r\nthe civil establishment. These two funds amounted in the year\r\n1817 to the sum of £20,272 6s. 2½d. which was\r\nderived from the following sources:\r\n\r\n*Duties collected by the naval officer,  17,240  0  7¼\r\nMarket, toll, and slaughtering duties,      872  5  7¼\r\n67 Spirit Licences,                       2,010  0  0\r\n10 Beer ditto,                               50  0  0\r\n4 Brewing ditto,                            100  0  0\r\n\r\nTotal                                   £20,272  6  2½\r\n\r\n\r\n[* For a list of these Duties, see the\r\nAppendix.]\r\n\r\nIf we add to this £907 6s. 9¼d. which is the\r\namount of the naval officer's commission on the duties collected\r\nby him, we have a grand total of £21,179 12s. 11¾d.;\r\nor, in other words, about one-sixth of the whole income of the\r\ncolony, absorbed by an illegal taxation. This is an enormous sum\r\nto be levied in such an infant community; and it will appear the\r\nmore so if it be recollected that nineteen-twentieths of it are\r\ncollected from the duty which has been imposed on spirituous\r\nliquors, and from licences to keep public-houses for the retail\r\nof them.\r\n\r\nSTATISTICAL ACCOUNT OF THE SETTLEMENTS IN VAN DIEMEN'S\r\nLAND.\r\n\r\nVan Diemen's Land is situated between 40 degrees 42', and 43\r\ndegrees 43' of south latitude, and between 145 degrees 31' and\r\n148 degrees 22' of east longitude. The honour of the discovery of\r\nthis island also belongs to the Dutch; but the survey of it has\r\nbeen principally effected by the English.\r\n\r\nThe aborigines of this country are, if possible, still more\r\nbarbarous and uncivilised than those of New Holland. They subsist\r\nentirely by hunting, and have no knowledge whatever of the art of\r\nfishing. Even the rude bark canoe which their neighbours possess,\r\nis quite unknown to them; and whenever they want to pass any\r\nsheet of water, they are compelled to construct a rude raft for\r\nthe occasion. Their arms and hunting implements also indicate an\r\ninferior degree of civilization. The womera, or throwing stick,\r\nwhich enables the natives of Port Jackson to cast their spears\r\nwith such amazing force and precision, is not used by them. Their\r\nspears, too, instead of being made with the bulrush, and only\r\npointed with hard wood, are composed entirely of it, and are\r\nconsequently more ponderous. In using them they grasp the center;\r\nbut they neither throw them so far nor so dexterously as the\r\nnatives of the parent colony. This circumstance is the more\r\nfortunate, as they maintain the most rancorous and inflexible\r\nhatred and hostility towards the colonists. This deep rooted\r\nenmity, however, does not arise so much from the ferocious nature\r\nof these savages, as from the inconsiderate and unpardonable\r\nconduct of our countrymen shortly after the foundation of the\r\nsettlement on the river Derwent. At first the natives evinced the\r\nmost friendly disposition towards the new comers; and would\r\nprobably have been actuated by the same amicable feeling to this\r\nday, had not the military officer entrusted with the command,\r\ndirected a discharge of grape and canister shot to be made among\r\na large body who were approaching, as he imagined, with hostile\r\ndesigns; but as it has since been believed with much greater\r\nprobability, merely from motives of curiosity and friendship. The\r\nhavoc occasioned among them by this murderous discharge, was\r\ndreadful; and since then all communication with them has ceased,\r\nand the spirit of animosity and revenge, which this unmerited and\r\natrocious act of barbarity has engendered, has been fostered and\r\naggravated to the highest pitch by the incessant rencontres which\r\nhave subsequently taken place between them and the settlers.\r\nThese, wherever and whenever an occasion offers, destroy as many\r\nof them as possible, and they in their turn never let slip an\r\nopportunity of retaliating on their blood-thirsty butchers.\r\nFortunately, however, for the colonists, they have seldom or\r\nnever been known to act on the offensive, except when they have\r\nmet some of their persecutors singly. Two persons armed with\r\nmuskets may traverse the island from one end to the other in the\r\nmost perfect safety.\r\n\r\nVan Diemen's Land has not so discouraging and repulsive an\r\nappearance from the coast as New Holland. Many fine tracts of\r\nland are found on the very borders of the sea, and the interior\r\nis almost invariably possessed of a soil admirably adapted to all\r\nthe purposes of civilized man. This island is upon the whole\r\nmountainous, and consequently abounds in streams. On the summits\r\nof many of the mountains there are large lakes, some of which are\r\nthe sources of considerable rivers. Of these the Derwent, Huon,\r\nand Tamar, rank in the first class.\r\n\r\nThere is perhaps no island in the world of the same size which\r\ncan boast of so many fine harbours: the best are the Derwent,\r\nPort Davy, Macquarie Harbour, Port Dalrymple, and Oyster Bay: the\r\nfirst is on its southern side, the second and third on its\r\nwestern, the fourth on its northern, and the fifth on its\r\neastern, so that it has excellent harbours in every direction.\r\nThis circumstance cannot fail to be productive of the most\r\nbeneficial effects, and will most materially assist the future\r\nmarch of colonization.\r\n\r\nThere is almost a perfect resemblance between the animal and\r\nvegetable kingdoms of this island and of New Holland. In their\r\nanimal kingdoms in particular, there is scarcely any variation.\r\nThe native dog, indeed, is unknown here; but there is an animal\r\nof the panther tribe in its stead, which, though not found in\r\nsuch numbers as the native dog is in New Holland, commits\r\ndreadful havoc among the flocks. It is true that its ravages are\r\nnot so frequent; but when they happen they are more extensive.\r\nThis animal is of considerable size, and has been known in some\r\nfew instances, to measure six feet and a half from the tip of the\r\nnose to the extremity of the tail; still it is cowardly, and by\r\nno means formidable to man: unless, indeed, when taken by\r\nsurprise, it invariably flies his approach.\r\n\r\nIn the feathered tribes of the two islands, there is scarcely\r\nany diversity; of this the wattle bird, which is about the size\r\nof a snipe, and considered a very great delicacy, is the only\r\ninstance which I can cite.\r\n\r\nLike New Holland it has many varieties of poisonous reptiles,\r\nbut they are neither so venomous nor so numerous as in that\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nIts rivers and seas too, abound with the same species of fish.\r\nOysters are found in much greater perfection, though not in\r\ngreater abundance. The rocks that border the coasts and harbours\r\nare literally covered with muscles, as the rocks at Port Jackson\r\nare with oysters.\r\n\r\nThere is not so perfect a resemblance in the vegetable\r\nkingdoms of the two islands; but still the dissimilarity, where\r\nit exists, is chiefly confined to their minor productions. In the\r\ntrees of the forest there is scarcely any difference. Van\r\nDiemen's Land wants the cedar, mahogany, and rose wood; but it\r\nhas very good substitutes for them in the black wood and Huon\r\npine, which is a species of the yew tree, and remarkable for its\r\nstrong odoriferous scent and extreme durability.\r\n\r\nThe principal mineralogical productions of this island are,\r\niron, copper, alum, coals, slate, limestone, asbestus, and\r\nbasaltes; all of which, with the exception of copper, are to be\r\nhad in the greatest abundance.\r\n\r\nHOBART TOWN.\r\n\r\nHobart Town, which is the seat of the Lieutenant-Governor of\r\nVan Diemen's Land, stands nine miles up the river Derwent. It was\r\nfounded only fifteen years since, and indeed the rudeness of its\r\nappearance sufficiently indicates the recency of its origin. The\r\nhouses are in general of the meanest description, seldom\r\nexceeding one story in height, and being for the most part\r\nweather-boarded without, and lathed and plastered within. Even\r\nthe government house is of very bad construction. The residences,\r\nindeed, of many individuals far surpass it. The population may be\r\nestimated at about one thousand souls.\r\n\r\nThis town is built principally on two hills, between which\r\nthere is a fine stream of excellent water, that issues from the\r\nTable Mountain, and falls into Sullivan's Cove. On this stream a\r\nflour mill has been erected, and there is sufficient fall in it\r\nfor the erection of two or three more. There are also within a\r\nshort distance of the town, several other streams which originate\r\nin the same mountain, and are equally well adapted to similar\r\npurposes. This is an advantage not possessed by the inhabitants\r\nof Port Jackson; since there is not in any of the cultivated\r\ndistricts to the eastward of the Blue Mountains a single run of\r\nwater which can be pronounced in every respect eligible for the\r\nerection of mills. Windmills are in consequence almost\r\nexclusively used for grinding corn in Sydney; but in the inland\r\ntowns and districts, the colonists are in a great measure obliged\r\nto have recourse to hand mills, as the winds during the greater\r\npart of the year, are not of sufficient force to penetrate the\r\nforest and set mills in motion.\r\n\r\nThe elevation of the Table Mountain, which is so called from\r\nthe great resemblance it bears to the mountain of the same name\r\nat the Cape of Good Hope, has not been determined; but it is\r\ngenerally estimated at about six thousand feet above the level of\r\nthe sea. During three-fourths of the year it is covered with\r\nsnow, and the same violent gusts of wind blow from it as from\r\nthis, its mountain name-sake; but no gathering clouds on its\r\nsummit give notice of the approaching storm. The fiery\r\nappearance, however, of the heavens, affords a sufficient warning\r\nto the inhabitants of the country. These blasts are happily\r\nconfined to the precincts of the mountain, and seldom last above\r\nthree hours; but nothing can exceed their violence for the time.\r\nIn the year 1810, I happened to be on board of a vessel which was\r\nbound to Hobart Town: in consequence of the winds proving scanty,\r\nwe were obliged to anchor during the night in D'Entrecasteaux's\r\nChannel. The following morning we got under weigh, expecting that\r\nthe sea breeze would set in by the time the anchor was hove up.\r\nThe seamen had no sooner effected this and set all sail, than we\r\nwere assailed with one of these mountain hurricanes. In an\r\ninstant the vessel was on her beam-ends, and in another, had not\r\nall the sheets and halyards been let go, she would either have\r\nupset or carried away her masts. The moment the sails were clued\r\nup we brought to again; and as we were in a harbour perfectly\r\nland-locked and very narrow, the vessel easily rode out this\r\nblast. It only lasted about two hours; but the sea breeze did not\r\nsucceed it that day. The next morning, however, it set in as\r\nusual.\r\n\r\nDuring the continuance of this mountain tornado, the waters of\r\nthe harbour were terribly agitated, and taken up in the same\r\nmanner as dust is collected by what are called whirlwinds in this\r\ncountry. So great indeed was its fury, that it required us to\r\nhold on by the ropes with all our force, in order to enable us to\r\nkeep our footing.\r\n\r\nThe harbour at and conducting to the river Derwent, yields to\r\nnone in the world; perhaps surpasses every other. There are two\r\nentrances to this river, which are separated by Pitt's Island;\r\none is termed D'Entrecasteaux's Channel, the other, Storm Bay.\r\nD'Entrecasteaux's Channel, from Point Collins up to Hobart Town,\r\na distance, following the course of the water, of thirty-seven\r\nmiles, is one continued harbour, varying in breadth from eight to\r\ntwo miles, and in depth from thirty to four fathoms. The river\r\nDerwent itself has three fathoms water for eleven miles above the\r\ntown, and is consequently navigable thus far for vessels of the\r\nlargest burthen. Reckoning therefore from Point Collins, there is\r\na line of harbour in D'Entrecasteaux's Channel and the Derwent,\r\ntogether of forty-eight miles, completely land-locked, and\r\naffording the best anchorage the whole way.\r\n\r\nThe entrance, however, by Storm Bay, does not offer the same\r\nadvantages; for it is twenty-two miles broad from Maria's Islands\r\nto Penguin Island, and completely exposed to the winds from south\r\nto south-east. This bay consequently does not afford the same\r\nexcellent anchorage as D'Entrecasteaux's Channel. It contains,\r\nhowever, some few nooks, in which vessels may take shelter in\r\ncase of necessity. The best of these is Adventure Bay, which is\r\nshut in from any winds that can blow directly from the ocean, but\r\nis nevertheless exposed to the north-east winds, which have a\r\nreach of twenty miles from the opposite side of the bay. There is\r\nconsequently, when these winds prevail, a considerable swell\r\nhere; but the force of the sea is in a great measure broken by\r\nPenguin Island; and vessels having good anchors and cables have\r\nnothing to fear.\r\n\r\nStorm Bay, besides thus forming one of the entrances to the\r\nriver Derwent, leads to another very good harbour, called North\r\nBay. This harbour is about sixteen miles long, and in some places\r\nsix miles and a half broad. The greater part of it is perfectly\r\nland-locked, and affords excellent anchorage in from two to\r\nfifteen fathoms water. That part in particular called Norfolk\r\nBay, forms a very spacious harbour of itself, being about three\r\nmiles in breadth and nine in length. This bay, besides being\r\nbetter sheltered than the rest of the harbours, contains the\r\ngreatest depth of water, having in no place less than four\r\nfathoms.\r\n\r\nAll the bays and harbours which have been just described,\r\nabound with right whale at a particular season of the year. These\r\nleviathans of the deep quit the boisterous ocean, and seek the\r\nmore tranquil waters of these harbours, when they are on the\r\npoint of calving. This happens in November, and they remain there\r\nwith their young between two and three months. During this period\r\nthere are generally every year a few of the colonial craft\r\nemployed in the whale fishery; but the duties which are levied in\r\nthis country on all oils procured in vessels not having a British\r\nregister, amount to a prohibition, and completely prevent the\r\ncolonists from prosecuting this fishery further than is necessary\r\nfor their own consumption, and for the supply of the East India\r\nmarket. Between two and three hundred tons annually suffice for\r\nboth these purposes.\r\n\r\nThe whales frequently go up the river Derwent as far as the\r\ntown; and it is no uncommon sight for its inhabitants to behold\r\nthe whole method of taking them, from the moment they are\r\nharpooned until they are finally killed by the frequent\r\napplication of the lance. This sight indeed has been occasionally\r\nwitnessed by the inhabitants of Sydney; since it has sometimes\r\noccurred that a stray fish has entered the harbour of Port\r\nJackson, while some of the South Sea whalers have been lying\r\nthere, and that these have lowered their boats and killed it.\r\n\r\nAll the bays and harbours in Van Diemen's Land, and most of\r\nthose likewise which are in Bass's Straits, and on the southern\r\ncoast of New Holland, abound with these fish at the same season.\r\nIf the colonists, therefore, were not thus restricted from this\r\nfishery, it would soon become an immense source of wealth to\r\nthem; and I have no doubt that they would be enabled to export\r\nmany thousand tons of oil annually to this country. But it is in\r\nvain that nature has been thus lavish of her bounties to them; in\r\nvain do their seas and harbours invite them to embark in these\r\ninexhaustible channels of wealth and enterprize. Their\r\ngovernment, that government which ought to be the foremost in\r\ndeveloping their nascent efforts, and fostering them to maturity,\r\nis itself the first to check their growth and impede their\r\nadvancement. What a miserly system of legislation is it, which\r\nthus locks up from its own subjects, a fund of riches that might\r\nadminister to the wants, and contribute to the happiness of\r\nthousands! What barbarous tantalization to compel them to thirst\r\nin the midst of the waters of abundance!\r\n\r\nPORT DALRYMPLE.\r\n\r\nThis port, which was discovered by Flinders, in 1798, lies\r\nthirty degrees E. S. E. of Three Hammock Island. The town of\r\nLaunceston stands about thirty miles from its entrance, at the\r\njunction of the North Esk, and the South with the river Tamar. It\r\nis little more than an inconsiderable village, the houses in\r\ngeneral being of the humblest description. Its population is\r\nbetween three and four hundred souls. The tide reaches nine or\r\nten miles up the river Esk, and the produce of the farms within\r\nthat distance, may be sent down to the town in boats. But the\r\nNorth Esk descends from a range of mountains, by a cataract\r\nimmediately into the river Tamar, and is consequently altogether\r\ninaccessible to navigation.\r\n\r\nThe Tamar has sufficient depth of water as far as Launceston,\r\nfor vessels of a hundred and fifty tons burthen; but the\r\nnavigation of this river is very intricate, by reason of the\r\nbanks and shallows with which it abounds, and it has been at\r\nlength prudently resolved to remove the seat of government nearer\r\nthe entrance of Port Dalrymple. A town called George Town, has\r\nbeen for the last three years in a state of active preparation;\r\nand it is probable that the commandant, and indeed the entire\r\ncivil and military establishments* of this settlement, have by\r\nthis time removed to it. In this case the greater part of the\r\npopulation of Launceston will soon follow. This desertion of its\r\ninhabitants will considerably diminish the value of landed\r\nproperty in that town, and consequently be productive of great\r\nloss to them; but there can be no doubt that the change of the\r\nseat of government will in the event materially contribute to the\r\nprosperity of the settlement in general. This abandonment,\r\ntherefore, or rather intended abandonment of the old town, has\r\nbeen dictated by the soundest principles of policy and justice;\r\nbut although the equity of the maxim that the interests of the\r\nfew should cede to the good of the many, is incontrovertible, it\r\nis nevertheless to be hoped, that some means will be contrived of\r\nindemnifying the inhabitants of Launceston for the great injury\r\nwhich they will suffer from the removal of the seat of government\r\nto George Town.\r\n\r\nWithin a few miles of Launceston, there is the most amazing\r\nabundance of iron. Literally speaking, there are whole mountains\r\nof this ore, which is so remarkably rich, that it has been found\r\nto yield seventy per cent. of pure metal. These mines have not\r\nyet been worked; the population, indeed, of the settlement would\r\nnot allow it; but there can be no doubt that they will at no very\r\nremote period become a source of considerable wealth to its\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\nThere is a communication by land between Launceston and Hobart\r\nTown, which are about one hundred and thirty miles distant from\r\neach other in a straight line, and about one hundred and sixty,\r\nfollowing the windings of the route at present frequented. No\r\nregular road has been constructed between these towns, but the\r\nnumerous carts and droves of cattle and sheep, which are\r\nconstantly passing from one to the other, have rendered the track\r\nsufficiently distinct and plain. In fact, the making a road is a\r\nmatter of very great ease, both here and in Port Jackson. The\r\nperson whoever he may be that wants to establish a cart-road to\r\nany place, marks the trees in the direction he wishes it to take,\r\nand these marks serve as a guide to all such as require to travel\r\non it. In a very short time the tracks of the horses and carts\r\nthat have passed along it become visible, the grass is gradually\r\ntrod down, and finally disappears, and thus a road is formed;\r\nnot, indeed, so good as one of the usual construction, but which\r\nanswers all the purposes of those who have occasion to make use\r\nof it. Wherever there happens to be a stream, or river that is\r\nnot fordable, it is customary to cut down two or three trees in\r\nsome spot on its banks, where it is seen that they will reach to\r\nthe other side of it. Across these, the boughs that are lopped\r\noff themselves, or smaller trees felled for the purpose, are laid\r\nclose together, and over all a sufficient covering of earth.\r\n\r\nOf this description are all the roads and bridges in Van\r\nDiemen's Land, and many of them, even in Port Jackson; but in\r\nthis respect it will be recollected that the latter is much in\r\nadvance of the former. The reason why the settlements on this\r\nisland are so much behind the parent colony, is not to be traced\r\nso much to the greater recency of their origin, as to the\r\ncircumstance of their inhabitants being for the most part\r\nestablished along the banks of navigable waters. At Port\r\nDalrymple, the majority of the settlers have fixed themselves on\r\nthe banks of the North Esk, within the navigable reach of that\r\nriver. The Derwent too, it has been seen, is navigable for\r\nvessels of the largest burden for twenty miles from its entrance.\r\nA little higher up, indeed, there are falls in it which interrupt\r\nits navigation; but it is hardly yet colonized beyond these\r\nfalls, and whenever that shall be the case, it may be easily\r\nrendered navigable for boats by the help of ferries for a\r\nconsiderable distance further. Such of the agriculturists as have\r\nnot settled on the banks of this river, have selected their farms\r\nin the district of Pitt Water; which extends along the northern\r\nside of that spacious harbour, called \"North Bay.\" These have\r\nconsequently the same facilities as those on the banks of the\r\nDerwent for sending their produce to market by water, and they\r\nnaturally prefer this, the cheapest mode of conveyance. It may,\r\ntherefore, be perceived that the superior advantages which are\r\nthus presented by an inland navigation, are the main causes why\r\nthe construction of regular roads has been so much neglected in\r\nthese settlements. So far, indeed, is this want of roads from\r\nbeing an inconvenience to the inhabitants of them, that the\r\nfacilities afforded by this inland navigation for the transport\r\nof all sorts of agricultural produce to market, is the principal\r\npoint of superiority which they can claim over their brethren at\r\nPort Jackson.\r\n\r\nADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE.\r\n\r\nIn the two settlements on this island, there is but one court\r\nof justice established by charter. This is termed the\r\nLieutenant-Governor's Court, and consists of the deputy judge\r\nadvocate, and two of the respectable inhabitants appointed from\r\ntime to time by the lieutenant-governor. The jurisdiction of this\r\ncourt is purely civil, and only extends to pleas where the sum at\r\nissue does not exceed £50; but no appeal lies from its\r\ndecisions. All causes for a higher amount, and all criminal\r\noffences beyond the cognizance of the bench of magistrates, are\r\nremoved, the former before the Supreme Court, and the latter\r\nbefore the Court of Criminal Judicature at Port Jackson.\r\n\r\nSTATE OF DEFENCE, ETC.\r\n\r\nThese settlements are in a very bad state of defence, having\r\nbut two companies of troops for the garrison and protection of\r\nthem both. They have consequently been infested for many years\r\npast, by a banditti of run-away convicts, who have endangered the\r\nperson and property of every one that has evinced himself hostile\r\nto their enormities. These wretches, who are known in the colony\r\nby the name of bush-rangers, even went so far as to write\r\nthreatening letters to the lieutenant-governor and the\r\nmagistracy. In this horrible state of anarchy a simultaneous\r\nfeeling of insecurity and dread, naturally pervaded the whole of\r\nthe inhabitants; and the most respectable part of the\r\nagricultural body with one accord betook themselves to the towns,\r\nas the only certain means of preserving their lives, gladly\r\nabandoning their property to prevent the much greater sacrifice\r\nwith which the defence of it would have been attended. There is\r\nno species of outrage and atrocity, in which these marauders did\r\nnot indulge: murders, incendiaries, and robberies were their\r\nordinary amusements, and have been for many years past the\r\nleading events in the annals of these unfortunate settlements.\r\nEvery measure that could be devised was taken for the capture and\r\npunishment of these wretches. They were repeatedly outlawed, and\r\nthe most alluring rewards were set upon their heads; but the\r\ninsufficiency of the military force, the extent of the island,\r\ntheir superior local knowledge, and the abundance of game, which\r\nenabled them to find an easy subsistence, and rendered them\r\nindependent, except for an occasional supply of ammunition, with\r\nwhich some unknown persons were base enough to furnish them in\r\nexchange for their ill acquired booty; all these circumstances\r\nconspired to baffle for many years every attempt that was made\r\nfor their apprehension. This long impunity served only to\r\nincrease their cruelty and temerity; and it was at last deemed\r\nexpedient by Lieutenant Governor Davy to declare the whole island\r\nunder the operation of martial law. This vigorous exertion of\r\nauthority was zealously seconded by the respectable inhabitants,\r\nmany of whom joined the military in the pursuit of these\r\nmiscreants, and fortunately succeeded by their joint exertions in\r\napprehending the most daring of their ringleaders, who were\r\ninstantly tried by a court martial and hanged in chains. This\r\nterrible, though necessary example, was followed by a\r\nproclamation offering a general amnesty to all the rest of these\r\ndelinquents who should surrender themselves before a certain day;\r\nexcepting, however, such of them as had been guilty of murder.\r\nThe proclamation had the desired effect: all who were not\r\nexcluded by their crimes availed themselves of the pardon thus\r\noffered them. But strange to say, they were allowed to remain in\r\nthe island; and whether they were enamoured of the licentious\r\nlife they had been so long leading, or whether they distrusted\r\nthe sincerity of the oblivion promised them, and became\r\napprehensive of eventual punishment, in a few months afterwards\r\nthey again betook themselves to the woods, and rejoined those who\r\nhad been excluded from the amnesty. After this, they rivalled\r\ntheir former atrocities, and a general feeling of consternation\r\nwas again excited among the well disposed part of the community.\r\nAnd here, as it may not be uninteresting to many of my readers to\r\nbe acquainted with some of the specific outrages of these\r\nmonsters, I subjoin the following extracts from the Sydney\r\nGazette of the 25th Jan. 1817.\r\n\r\nThe accounts of robberies by the banditti of bush-rangers on\r\nVan Diemen's Land, presents a melancholy picture of the\r\ndistresses to which the more respectable classes of inhabitants\r\nare constantly exposed from the daring acts of those infamous\r\nmarauders, who are divided into small parties, and are designated\r\nby the name of the principal ruffian at their head, of whom one\r\nMichael Howe appears to be the most alert in depredation. The\r\naccounts received by the Kangaroo, which commence from the\r\nbeginning of November, state that on the 7th of that month, the\r\nhouse and premises of Mr. David Rose at Port Dalrymple, were\r\nattacked and plundered of a considerable property, by Peter\r\nSefton and his gang. The delinquents were pursued by the\r\ncommandant at the head of a strong detachment of the 46th\r\nregiment; but returned after a five days hunt through the woods,\r\nwithout being able to discover the villains, among whom is stated\r\nto have been a free man, named Denis M'Caig, who went from hence\r\nto Port Dalrymple in the Brothers.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 17th of November, the premises of Mr.\r\nThomas Hayes, at Bagdad, were attacked at a time when Mr. Stocker\r\nand wife, and Mr. Andrew Whitehead (the former on their route\r\nfrom Hobart Town to Port Dalrymple, with a cart containing a\r\nlarge and valuable property) had unfortunately put up at the\r\nhouse for the night. Michael Howe was the chief of this banditti,\r\nwhich consisted of eight others. The property of which they\r\nplundered Mr. and Mrs. Stocker on this occasion, was upwards of\r\n£300 value, among which were two kegs of spirits. One of\r\nthese, a member of the gang wantonly wasted, by firing a\r\npistol-ball through the head of the keg, which contained eleven\r\ngallons. They set their watches by Mr. Whitehead's, which they\r\nafterwards returned; but took Mr. Stocker's away with their other\r\nplunder. Mr. Wade, chief constable of Hobart Town, had stopped\r\nwith the others at Mr. Hayes's; but hearing a noise, which he\r\nconsidered to denote the approach of bush-rangers, he prudently\r\nattended to the admonition, and escaped their fury, which it was\r\nconcluded would have fallen heavily upon him, as they are at\r\nvariance with all conditions in life that are inimical to their\r\ncrimes. On the morning of the 2d instant, Mr. William Maum, of\r\nHobart Town, sustained the loss of three stacks of wheat by fire\r\nat his farm at Clarence Plains, owing to the act of an\r\nincendiary.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of November a large body, consisting of fourteen\r\nmen and two women, were unwelcomely fallen in with by a single\r\nman on horseback, at Scantling's Plains. Howe and Geary were the\r\nmost conspicuous: they compelled him to bear testimony to the\r\nswearing in of their whole party, to abide by some resolutions\r\ndictated in a written paper, which one of them finished writing\r\nin the traveller's presence. After a detention of about three\r\nquarters of an hour, he was suffered to proceed under strong\r\ninjunctions to declare what he had been an eye-witness of; and to\r\ndesire Mr. Humphrey, the magistrate, and Mr. Wade, the chief\r\nconstable, to take care of themselves, as they were bent on\r\ntaking their lives, as well as to prevent them from growing\r\ngrain, or keeping goods of any kind. And by the information of a\r\nperson upon oath, it appears that they had about the same period,\r\nforced away two government servants from their habitations, to a\r\ndistant place, on which the crimes of these wretches have stamped\r\nthe appellation of murderer's plains, (by themselves facetiously\r\ncalled _the tallow-chandler's shop_) where they kept them to\r\nwork three days in rendering down beef-fat. How they could\r\nafterwards appropriate so great a quantity of rendered fat and\r\nsuet, is truly a question worthy to be demanded; for it is far\r\nmore likely it should be taken off their hands by persons in or\r\nnear the settlements, who are leagued with them, in the way of\r\nbartering one commodity for another, than that the bush-rangers\r\nshould either keep it for their own use, or bestow so much\r\ntrouble on the preparation of an article that would soon spoil in\r\ntheir hands. The caftle that were in this instance so devoted,\r\nwere the property of Stones and Tray, who declare that out of\r\nthree hundred head, one hundred and forty have lately\r\ndisappeared\".\r\n\r\nAll the outrages above enumerated, it will be seen, were\r\nperpetrated within the short period of ten days; and these\r\nsettlements continued the scene of similar enormities until the\r\nJuly following, an interval of nearly eight months. On the\r\nserious injury which the industrious and deserving of all\r\nclasses, must have experienced in that time, from the inability\r\nof the government to afford them protection, it would be useless\r\nhere to dilate. It must be evident, that such extremes of anarchy\r\ncould not be of any long duration; and that one or other of these\r\ntwo events became inevitable; either that the exertions and\r\nenterprizes of the colonists should be brought to a stand, or\r\nthat these disturbers of the general tranquillity, should suffer\r\ncondign punishment. Fortunately the cause of public justice\r\ntriumphed, and the majority of these monsters either fell victims\r\nto common distrust, or to the violated laws of their country. And\r\nhere, after detailing some few of their excesses, I cannot\r\nrefrain from giving in turn the account of the measures that led\r\nto their discomfiture and apprehension, as extracted from the\r\nSydney Gazette of the 4th October, 1817.\r\n\r\nA meeting of public officers and principal inhabitants and\r\nsettlers, was convened at Hobart Town, by sanction of his honour,\r\nLieutenant-Governor Sorrel, (the successor of Colonel Davy) on\r\nthe 5th of July, for the purpose of considering the most\r\neffectual measures for suppressing the banditti; when the utmost\r\nalacrity manifested itself to support the views of government in\r\npromoting that desirable object, and a liberal subscription was\r\nimmediately entered into for the purpose. The following\r\nproclamation was immediately afterwards issued by the\r\nLieutenant-Governor.\r\n\r\nWhereas, the armed banditti, who have for a considerable time\r\ninfested the interior of this island, did on the 10th ultimo,\r\nmake an attack upon the store at George Town, which being left\r\nunprotected, they plundered, taking away two boats, which they\r\nafterwards cast ashore at the entrance of Port Dalrymple; and\r\nwhereas, the principal leader in the outrages which have been\r\ncommitted by this band of robbers, is Peter Geary, a deserter\r\nfrom his Majesty's 73d regiment, charged also with murder and\r\nvarious other offences; and whereas, the undermentioned offenders\r\nhave been concerned with the said Peter Geary in most of these\r\nenormities; the following rewards will be paid to any person or\r\npersons, who shall apprehend these offenders, or any of them:\r\n\r\nPeter Geary--One Hundred Guineas.\r\nPeter Septon, John Jones, Richard Collyer--Eighty Guineas\r\neach.\r\nThomas Coine, Brown or Brune, a Frenchman--Fifty Guineas\r\neach.\r\n\r\nAnd whereas, George Watts, a prisoner, who absented himself\r\nfrom the Coal River, previous to the expiration of his sentence,\r\nand who stands charged with various robberies and crimes, is now\r\nat large: it is hereby declared, that a reward of eighty guineas\r\nwill be paid to any person or persons, who shall apprehend the\r\nsaid George Watts.\r\n\r\nAnd all magistrates and commanders of military stations, and\r\nparties, and all constables and others of his majesty's subjects,\r\nare enjoined to use their utmost efforts to apprehend the\r\ncriminals above named.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of July, a division of the banditti proceeded to\r\nGeorge Town, and seizing upon the government boats, induced five\r\nof the working people to abscond with them; upon representation\r\nwhereof to the Lieutenant-Governor, a proclamation was issued\r\nrequiring the return of those persons, under the assurance of\r\nforgiveness, if so returning within twenty days, from the\r\nconsideration that the settlement of George Town had been for\r\nsome days without command or controul; the causes of which will\r\nbe found in our supplement of this day; wherein Mr.\r\nSuperintendent Leith, has, in his testimony upon the murder of\r\nthe chief constable of the settlement, declared his necessary\r\nabsence to Launceston at that express period.\r\n\r\nThe gang of bush-rangers appeared in the vicinity of Black\r\nBrush on Saturday, and were tracked on the following morning by\r\nSerjeant M'Carthy, of the 46th, with his party. On Monday the\r\nbush-rangers were at a house at Tea-tree Brush, where they had\r\ndined, and about three o'clock Serjeant M'Carthy with his party\r\ncame up. The bush-rangers ran out of the house into the woods,\r\nand being eleven in number, and well covered by timber and\r\nground, the eight soldiers could not close with them. After a\r\ngood deal of firing, Geary the leader was wounded, and fell; two\r\nothers were also wounded. The knapsacks of the whole and their\r\ndogs were taken. Geary died the same night, and his corpse was\r\nbrought into town on Tuesday, as were the two wounded men.\r\n\r\nThe remaining eight bush-rangers were seen in the\r\nneighbourhood of the Coal River on Wednesday; but, as they must\r\nhave been destitute of provisions and ammunition, sanguine hopes\r\nwere entertained of their speedy fall.\r\n\r\nDennis Currie and Matthew Kiegan, two of the original\r\nbush-rangers, surrendered on the Monday following.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, a coroner's inquest was held on the body of\r\nJames Geary, who died of the wound received in the affair at\r\nTea-tree Brush. Verdict, Homicide in furtherance of public\r\njustice.\r\n\r\nJones, a principal of the banditti, was shot in the beginning\r\nof August, in the neighbourhood of Swanport, which is on the\r\neastern shore. For some days they had not been heard of; but by\r\nthe extraordinary exertions of Serjeant M'Carthy and his party of\r\nthe 46th regiment, were tracked and overtaken at the above place;\r\non which occasion Jones was killed on the spot by a ball through\r\nthe head. A prisoner of the name of Holmes was by the\r\nbush-ranger's fire, wounded in two places, but we do not hear\r\nmortally.\r\n\r\nOn the Sunday evening after the above affair, some of the\r\nvillains effected a robbery at Clarence Plains; but became so\r\nexcessively intemperate from intoxication as to quarrel among\r\nthemselves; the consequence was, that another of the gang of the\r\nname of Rollards, having been most severely bruised and beaten by\r\nhis associates fell into the hands of a settler, and was by him\r\ntaken a prisoner into Hobart Town. White and Johnson, two others\r\nof the gang, were apprehended by Serjeant M'Carthy's party, on\r\nThursday the 14th of August, being conducted to their haunts by a\r\nnative woman, distinguished by the name of Black Mary, and\r\nanother girl.\r\n\r\nAfter the above successes in reducing the number of these\r\npersons, some of them still continued out, on the 16th of August,\r\nas appears from a report published: of the old bush-rangers,\r\nSepton, Collyer, Coine, and Brune, also Watts, who kept separate\r\nfrom the rest, and Michael Howe, who had before delivered himself\r\nup, and after remaining some weeks in Hobart Town, took again to\r\nthe woods, from a dread, as was imagined, of ultimately being\r\ncalled to answer for his former offences. At this period also,\r\nthere were two absentees from George Town, Port Dalrymple; a\r\nnumber of the working hands having gone from that settlement\r\nshortly before, all of whom had returned to their duty but these\r\ntwo. White, Rollards, and Peck, were about this time under a\r\nreward of sixty guineas for their apprehension, for an attempt to\r\ncommit a robbery at Clarence Plains: Peck was a freeman, the\r\nother two prisoners.\r\n\r\nBy the 6th of September, nearly the whole of the absentees of\r\nwhatever description had either surrendered or been apprehended;\r\nand upon this day a proclamation was issued offering the\r\nfollowing rewards: for the apprehension of Michael Howe, one\r\nhundred guineas; for George Watts, eighty guineas; and for Brune,\r\nthe Frenchman, fifty guineas; and in consequence of these prompt\r\nand efficacious arrangements, additional captures had been made,\r\nwhich placed it nearly beyond a doubt that Howe is almost, if not\r\nthe only individual of the desperate gangs now at large.\r\n\r\nThis latter assertion, however, does not appear to have been\r\ncorrect; for in a Sydney Gazette of the 25th of October, of the\r\nsame year, we have the following account of the apprehension and\r\nsurrender of some others of this banditti, and of an unsuccessful\r\nattempt to take Michael Howe, which will tend to elucidate the\r\ndesperate character of this ruffian.\r\n\r\nSeveral persons have arrived as witnesses on the prosecution\r\nof offenders transmitted for trial by the Pilot; two of whom are\r\ncharged with wilful murder, viz. Richard Collyer, as a principal\r\nin the atrocious murder of the late William Carlisle and James\r\nO'Berne, who were shot by a banditti of bush-rangers at the\r\nsettlement of New Norfolk, on the 24th of April, 1815; the\r\nparticulars whereof were published in the Sydney Gazette of the\r\n20th of the following May. The other prisoner for murder is John\r\nHilliard, who was also one of the banditti of bush-rangers; but\r\nbeing desirous of giving himself up, determined previously by\r\nforce or guile, to achieve some exploit, that might place the\r\nsincerity of his contrition beyond doubt. Accident soon brought\r\nthe above Collyer, together with Peter Septon, another of the\r\nbanditti, within his power. He attacked and killed Septon, and\r\nwounded Collyer, who nevertheless got away, but was soon\r\napprehended. It is for the killing of Septon, he is therefore to\r\nbe tried. Four of the prisoners sent by this vessel are for sheep\r\nstealing. Another of the late banditti, George Watts, is come up\r\nalso, but under no criminal charge, as we are informed, he having\r\nbeen desperately wounded by Michael Howe, in an attempt assisted\r\nby William Drew, to take him into Hobart Town a prisoner; but in\r\nwhich exertion Drew was shot dead by that desperate offender, and\r\nthe survivor Watts nearly killed also.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nI have been thus copious in extracts from the Sydney Gazette,\r\nto shew the lamentable state of danger and anarchy in which the\r\ncolonists on Van Diemen's Land have been kept by an\r\ninconsiderable banditti; who, from the imbecility of the local\r\ngovernment, have been enabled to continue for many years in a\r\ntriumphant career of violence and impunity. This iniquitous and\r\nformidable association may, indeed, be considered as crushed for\r\nthe moment, although the most desperate member of it is still at\r\nlarge. But what pledge have the well disposed part of the\r\ninhabitants, that a band equally atrocious will not again spring\r\nup, and endanger the general peace and security? What guarantee,\r\nin fact, have they that this very ruffian, the soul and center of\r\nthe late combination, will not serve as a rallying point to the\r\nprofligate, and again collect around him a circle of robbers and\r\nmurderers as desperate and bloody as the miscreants who have been\r\nannihilated? And can the pursuits of industry quietly proceed\r\nunder the harassing dread which this constant liability to\r\noutrage and depredation must inspire? There is no principle less\r\ncontrovertible than that the subject has the same claims on the\r\ngovernment for support and protection, as they have on him, for\r\nobedience and fidelity. The compact is as binding on the one\r\nparty, as on the other; and it is really discreditable to the\r\nestablished character of this country, that any part of its\r\ndominions should have continued for so long a period, the scene\r\nof such flagrant enormities, merely from the want of a sufficient\r\nmilitary force to ensure the due administration of the laws, and\r\nto maintain the public tranquillity.\r\n\r\nCLIMATE, ETC.\r\n\r\nThe climate of this island is equally healthy, and much more\r\ncongenial to the European constitution, than that of Port\r\nJackson. The north-west winds, which are there productive of such\r\nviolent variations of temperature, are here unknown; and neither\r\nthe summers, nor winters, are subject to any great extremes of\r\nheat, or cold. The frosts, indeed, are much more severe, and of\r\nmuch longer duration; and the mountains with which this island\r\nabounds, are covered with snow during the greater part of the\r\nyear; but in the vallies it never lingers on the ground more than\r\na few hours. Upon an average, the mean difference of temperature,\r\nbetween these settlements and those on New Holland, (I speak of\r\nsuch as are to the eastward of the Blue Mountains; for the\r\ncountry to the westward of them, it has been already stated, is\r\nequally cold with any part of Van Diemen's Land,) may be\r\nestimated at ten degrees of Fahrenheit, at all seasons of the\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThe prevailing diseases are the same as at Port Jackson: i. e.\r\nphthisis, and dysentery; but the former is not so common.\r\nRheumatic complaints, however, which are scarcely known there,\r\nexist here to a considerable extent.\r\n\r\nSOIL, ETC.\r\n\r\nIn this island, as in New Holland, there is every diversity of\r\nsoil, but certainly in proportion to the surface of the two\r\ncountries, this contains, comparatively, much less of an\r\nindifferent quality. Large tracts of land perfectly free from\r\ntimber or underwood, and covered with the most luxuriant herbage,\r\nare to be found in all directions; but more particularly in the\r\nenvirons of Port Dalrymple. This sort of land is\r\n_invariably_ of the _very best description_, and\r\n_millions_ of acres still remain _unappropriated, which\r\nare capable of being instantly converted to all the purposes of\r\nhusbandry. There the colonist has no expence to incur in clearing\r\nhis farm: he is not compelled to a great preliminary out-lay of\r\ncapital, before he can expect a considerable return; he has only\r\nto set fire to the grass, to prepare his land for the immediate\r\nreception of the plough-share; so that, if he but possess a good\r\nteam of horses, or oxen, with a set of harness, and a couple of\r\nsubstantial ploughs, he has the main requisites for commencing an\r\nagricultural establishment, and for ensuring a comfortable\r\nsubsistence for himself and family._\r\n\r\nTo this great superiority which these southern settlements may\r\nclaim over the parent colony, may be superadded two other items\r\nof distinction, which are perhaps of equal magnitude and\r\nimportance. First, The rivers here have sufficient fall in them\r\nto prevent any excessive accumulation of water, from violent or\r\ncontinued rains; and are consequently free from those awful and\r\ndestructive inundations to which all its rivers are perpetually\r\nsubject. Here, therefore, the industrious colonist may settle on\r\nthe banks of a navigable river, and enjoy all the advantages of\r\nsending his produce to market by water, without running the\r\nconstant hazard of having the fruits of his labour, the golden\r\npromise of the year, swept away in an hour by a capricious and\r\ndomineering element. Secondly, The seasons are more regular and\r\ndefined, and those great droughts which have been so frequent at\r\nPort Jackson, are altogether unknown. In the years 1813, 1814,\r\nand 1815, when the whole face of the country there was literally\r\nburnt up, and vegetation completely at a stand still from the\r\nwant of rain, an abundant supply of it fell here, and the\r\nharvests, in consequence, were never more productive. Indeed,\r\nsince these settlements were first established, a period of\r\nfifteen years, the crops have never sustained any serious\r\ndetriment from an insufficiency of rain; whereas, in the parent\r\ncolony, there have been in the thirty-one years that have elapsed\r\nsince its foundation, I may venture to say, half a dozen dearths,\r\noccasioned by drought, and at least as many arising from\r\nfloods.\r\n\r\nThe circumstance, therefore, of Van Diemen's Land being thus\r\nexempt from those calamitous consequences, which are so frequent\r\nin New Holland, from a superabundance of rain in the one\r\ninstance, and a deficiency of it in the other, is a most\r\nimportant point of consideration, for all such as hesitate in\r\ntheir choice betwixt the two countries; and is well worthy the\r\nmost serious attention of those who are desirous of emigrating to\r\none or the other of them, with a view to become mere\r\nagriculturists.\r\n\r\nIn the system of agriculture pursued in the two colonies,\r\nthere is no difference, save that the Indian corn, or maize, is\r\nnot cultivated here, because the climate is too cold to bring\r\nthis grain to maturity. Barley and oats, however, arrive at much\r\ngreater perfection, and afford the inhabitants a substitute,\r\nalthough by no means an equivalent, for this highly valuable\r\nproduct. The wheat, too, which is raised here, is of much\r\nsuperior description to the wheat grown in any of the districts\r\nat Port Jackson, and will always command in the Sydney market, a\r\ndifference of price sufficiently great to pay for the additional\r\ncost of transport. The average produce, also, of land here, is\r\ngreater, although it does not exceed, perhaps not equal the\r\nproduce of the rich flooded lands on the banks of the Hawkesbury\r\nand Nepean. A gentleman who resided many years at Port Dalrymple,\r\nestimates the average produce of the crops at that settlement as\r\nfollows: Wheat, thirty bushels per acre; barley, forty-five\r\nbushels per ditto; oats, he does not know, but say sixty bushels\r\nper ditto. This estimate is not at all calculated to impress the\r\nEnglish farmer with as favourable an opinion of the fertility of\r\nthis settlement as it merits; but if he only witnessed the\r\nslovenly mode of tillage which is practised there, he would be\r\nsurprised not that the average produce of the crops is so small,\r\nbut that it is so great. If the same land had the benefit of the\r\nsystem of agriculture that prevails throughout the county of\r\nNorfolk, it may be safely asserted that its produce would be\r\ndoubled. The land on the upper banks of the river Derwent and at\r\nPitt-water, is equally fertile; but the average produce of the\r\ncrops on the whole of the cultivated districts belonging to this\r\nsettlement, is at least one-fifth less than at Port\r\nDalrymple.\r\n\r\nThese settlements do not contain either such a variety or\r\nabundance of fruit as the parent colony. The superior coldness of\r\ntheir climate sufficiently accounts for the former deficiency,\r\nand the greater recency of their establishment for the latter.\r\nThe orange, citron, guava, loquet, pomegranate, and many other\r\nfruits which attain the greatest perfection at Port Jackson,\r\ncannot be produced here at all without having recourse to\r\nartificial means; while many more, as the peach, nectarine,\r\ngrape, etc. only arrive at a very inferior degree of maturity. On\r\nthe other hand, as has been already noticed, the apple, currant,\r\ngooseberry, and indeed all those fruits for which the climate of\r\nthe parent colony is too warm, are raised here without\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nThe system of rearing and fattening cattle is perfectly\r\nanalogous to that which is pursued at Port Jackson. The natural\r\ngrasses afford an abundance of pasturage at all seasons of the\r\nyear, and no provision of winter provender, in the shape either\r\nof hay or artificial food, is made by the settler for his cattle;\r\nyet, notwithstanding this palpable omission, and the greater\r\nlength and severity of the winters, all manner of stock attain\r\nthere a much larger size than at Port Jackson. Oxen from three to\r\nfour years old average here about 700 lbs. and wethers from two\r\nto three years old, from 80 to 90 lbs.; while there oxen of the\r\nsame age, do not average more than 500 lbs. and wethers not more\r\nthan 40 lbs. At Port Dalrymple it is no uncommon occurrence for\r\nyearly lambs to weigh from 100 to 120 lbs. and for three year old\r\nwethers to weigh 150 lbs. and upwards; but this great\r\ndisproportion of weight arises in some measure from the greater\r\npart of the sheep at this settlement, having become, from\r\nconstant crossing, nearly of the pure Teeswater breed. Still the\r\nsuperior richness of the natural pastures in these southern\r\nsettlements, is without doubt the main cause of the increased\r\nweight at which both sheep and cattle arrive; since there is both\r\na kindlier and larger breed of cattle at Port Jackson, which\r\nnevertheless, neither weighs as heavy, nor affords as much suet\r\nas the cattle there. This is an incontrovertible proof that the\r\nnatural grasses possess much more nutritive and fattening\r\nqualities in this colony than in the other; and the superior\r\nclearness of the country is quite sufficient to account for this\r\ncircumstance, without taking into the estimate the additional\r\nfact, that up to a certain parallel of latitude, to which neither\r\nthe one nor the other of the countries in question extends, the\r\nsuperior adaptation of the colder climate for the rearing and\r\nfattening of stock, is quite unquestionable.\r\n\r\nThe price of provisions is about on a par in the two colonies,\r\nor if there be any difference, it is somewhat lower here. Horses\r\nthree or four years back were considerably dearer than at Port\r\nJackson; but large importations of them have been made in\r\nconsequence, and it is probable that their value is before this\r\ntime completely equalized.\r\n\r\nThe wages of ordinary labourers are at least thirty per cent.\r\nhigher, and of mechanics, fifty per cent. higher than in the\r\nparent colony; a disproportion solely attributable to the very\r\nunequal and injudicious distribution that has been made of the\r\nconvicts.\r\n\r\nThe progress made by these settlements in manufactures, is too\r\ninconsiderable to deserve notice, further than as it affords a\r\nstriking proof in how much more flourishing and prosperous a\r\ncondition they are than the parent colony.\r\n\r\nThe commerce carried on by the colonists is of the same nature\r\nas that which is maintained by their brethren at Port Jackson.\r\nLike these, they have no staple export to offer in exchange for\r\nthe various commodities which they import from foreign countries,\r\nand are obliged principally to rely on the expenditure of the\r\ngovernment for the means of procuring them. Their annual income\r\nmay be taken as follows:\r\n\r\nMoney expended by the government for the pay and subsistence\r\nof the civil and military, and for the support of such of\r\nthe convicts as are victualled from the king's stores,        £30,000\r\nMoney expended by foreign shipping,                             3,000\r\nWheat, etc. exported to Port Jackson,                           4,000\r\nExports collected by the merchants of the settlement,           5,000\r\nSundries,                                                       2,000\r\n                                                               ------\r\nTotal,                                                        £44,000\r\n                                                               ------\r\n\r\n\r\nThe duties collected in these southern settlements, are\r\nexactly on the same scale as at Port Jackson, and amount to about\r\n£5,000 annually, inclusive of the per centage allowed the\r\ncollectors of them.\r\n\r\nA general Statement of the Land in Cultivation, etc. the\r\nQuantities of Stock, etc. as accounted for at the General\r\nMuster in New South Wales, taken by His Excellency Governor\r\nMacquarie, and Deputy Commissary General Allan, commencing the\r\n6th October, and finally closing the 25th November, 1817,\r\ninclusive; with an exact Account of the same at Van Diemen's\r\nLand.\r\n\r\nAcres in Wheat                           18,462\r\n         Ground prepared for Maize       11,714\r\n         Barley                             856½\r\n         Oats                               156¾\r\n         Pease and Beans                    204¼\r\n         Potatoes                           559\r\n         Garden and Orchard                 863\r\n         Cleared ground                  47,564¼\r\n         Total held                     235,003¼\r\n\r\nHorses                                    3,072\r\nHorned cattle                            44,753\r\nSheep                                   170,920\r\nHogs                                     17,842\r\nBushels of Wheat                         24,05 [sic]\r\nBushels of Maize                          1,506\r\n\r\nN.

The causes,\r\nhowever, which have contributed to its retardment, are the same,\r\nas have been attended with similar effects in all ages. Not only\r\nthe records of the years that are no more, but the experience\r\nalso of the present day, concur in proving that the prosperity of\r\nnations is not so much the result of the fertility of their soil,\r\nand the benignity of their climate, as of the wisdom and policy\r\nof their institutions. Decadence, poverty, wretchedness, and\r\nvice, have been the invariable attendants of bad governments; as\r\nprosperity, wealth, happiness, and virtue, have been of good\r\nones. Rome, once the glory of the world; now a bye-word among the\r\nnations: once the seat of civilization, of affluence, and of\r\npower; now the abode of superstition, poverty, and weakness, is a\r\nlasting monument of the truth of this assertion. Her greatness\r\nwas founded on freedom, and rose with her consulate; her\r\ndecadence may be said to have commenced with her first emperor,\r\nand was completed under his vicious and despotic dynasty: her\r\nclimate and soil still remain; but the freedom which raised her\r\nto the empire of the world has passed away with her\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nIf we search still further back into antiquity, we shall find\r\nthat all the great nations which have at various times\r\npreponderated over their neighbours, attained their utmost force\r\nand vigour, during the period of their greatest freedom and\r\nvirtue; and that their decadence and ultimate annihilation were\r\nthe work of a succession of vicious and tyrannical rulers. The\r\nempires of Persia and of Greece, were successively established by\r\nthe superior freedom and virtue of their citizens; and it was\r\nonly when the institutions, which were the source of this freedom\r\nand virtue, were no longer reverenced and enforced, that each in\r\nits turn became the prey of a freer and more virtuous people.\r\n\r\nThe experience of modern times is still more conclusive on\r\nthis subject; because no part of the chain of events which have\r\ncontributed to the aggrandisement or impair of existing nations,\r\nlies hid in the mist of ages. If we regard the unprecedented\r\nwealth and power of our own country, we shall be convinced that\r\nher present pre-eminent position is not so much the effect of her\r\nsoil and climate, since in these respects she is confessedly\r\nbehind many of the nations of Europe, as of the superior freedom\r\nof her laws, which have engendered her a freer, more virtuous,\r\nand more warlike race of people. It is to her superior polity\r\nalone that she is indebted for a dominion, unparalleled in the\r\nhistory of the world; and it is to its rigid maintenance and\r\nenforcement that she must look for its durability.\r\n\r\nWhile England has been thus assiduously attentive to her own\r\nimmediate internal prosperity, she has not in general been\r\nneglectful of those external possessions, which she has gradually\r\nacquired by colonization, by conquest, or by cession. On the most\r\ndistant branches of her empire, she has engrafted, as far as\r\ncircumstances would in general admit, those institutions which\r\nhave been the main cause of her own internal happiness and\r\nprosperity. In the West Indies, in Canada, and lately in the\r\nIonian Islands, she has introduced the elective franchise, and\r\nestablished that mixed counterpoising form of government, whose\r\nthree component parts, though essentially different in their\r\nnatures, so admirably coalesce and form one combined harmonious\r\nwhole. It has, in fact, been one of the leading maxims of her\r\npolitical conduct, and undoubtedly one of the chief causes of her\r\npresent greatness, to attach the people who have been embodied\r\ninto her empire, or who have emigrated from her shores only to\r\ncolonise new countries, and thus to extend her limits and\r\nincrease her resources, by an equality of rights and privileges\r\nwith her subjects at home. The navigation act, indeed, militates\r\nin some degree, against the liberal view here taken of her\r\ncolonial policy; but the existence of this single act, which,\r\nhowever its wisdom may be at present canvassed, there can be no\r\ndoubt has proved the basis of her commercial and maritime\r\nascendancy, will not invalidate the claim to liberality, of which\r\nher colonial system is in other respects deserving. The conduct\r\nof her government has undoubtedly been in most instances liberal\r\nand enlightened; and if they have occasionally deviated from\r\ntheir ordinary enlarged policy of establishing the representative\r\nsystem, and leaving to the colonies, themselves, the liberty of\r\nframing laws adapted to their several circumstances and wants, it\r\nhas been principally in those cases where the ancient inveterate\r\nhabits of the people, their difference of religion, and inferior\r\ncivilization, have rendered such deviations unavoidable. India\r\nfurnishes the principal example of such exception to her general\r\npolicy; yet, even in her remote possessions in that country, the\r\nsixty millions who are subject to her sway, enjoy a security of\r\nperson and property unknown to them while under the government of\r\ntheir native princes. It is on this amelioration in their\r\ncondition, and not on the strength and number of her armies, that\r\nher dominion in that part of the world is founded; and after all,\r\nwhat government is so stable as that which is bottomed on\r\nopinion, and depends for its existence on general utility, and\r\nthe consent of the governed? Dominion may, indeed, be acquired,\r\nand continued by force and terror; but if it have no other props\r\nto support it, it is at best but precarious, and must, sooner or\r\nlater, fall, either by the resistance of those whom it would hold\r\nin subjection, or by undermining their moral and physical\r\nenergies, and thus rendering them unfit even for the vile\r\npurposes of despotism itself.\r\n\r\nThe colony of New South Wales, is, I believe, the only one of\r\nour possessions exclusively inhabited by Englishmen, in which\r\nthere is not at least the shadow of a free government, as it\r\npossesses neither a council, a house of assembly, nor even the\r\nprivilege of trial by jury. And although it must be confessed\r\nthat the strange ingredients of which this colony was formed, did\r\nnot, at the epoch of its foundation, warrant a participation of\r\nthese important privileges, it will be my endeavour in this essay\r\nto prove that the withholding of them up to the present period,\r\nhas been the sole cause why it has not realized the expectations\r\nwhich its founders were led to form of its capabilities.\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to conceive that the same causes, which in\r\nthe lapse of centuries have sufficed to undermine and eventually\r\ningulph vast empires, should be able to impede the progress of\r\nsmaller communities, whether they be kingdoms, states, or\r\ncolonies. Arbitrary governments, indeed, are so generally\r\nadmitted to impair the moral and physical energies of a people,\r\nthat it would be superfluous to enter into an elaborate\r\ndisquisition, in order to demonstrate the truth of a position,\r\nwhich has been confirmed by the experience of ages. Whoever is\r\nconvinced that he has no rights, no possessions that are sacred\r\nand inviolable, is a slave, and devoid of that noble feeling of\r\nindependence which is essential to the dignity of his nature, and\r\nthe due discharge of his functions. This noble assurance that he\r\nis in the path of duty and security, so long as he refrain from\r\nthe violation of those laws which may have been framed for the\r\ngood of the community of which he is a member, is the main spring\r\nof all industry and improvement. But this dignified feeling\r\ncannot exist in any society which is subject to the arbitrary\r\nwill of an individual; and although the governor of this colony\r\ndoes not exactly possess the unlimited authority of an eastern\r\ndespot, since he may be ultimately made accountable to his\r\nsovereign and the laws, for the abuse of the power delegated to\r\nhim, I may be allowed to ask, should he invade the property, and\r\nviolate the personal liberty of those whom he ought to govern\r\nwith justice and impartiality, where are the oppressed to seek\r\nfor retribution? Is it in this country, situated at sixteen\r\nthousand miles from the seat of his injustice and oppression? To\r\ntell a poor man that he may obtain redress in the court of King's\r\nBench, what is it but a cruel mockery, calculated to render the\r\npang more poignant, which it would pretend to alleviate?\r\n\r\nI am not here amusing myself with the supposition of\r\ncontingencies that may never occur. I am alluding to outrages\r\nthat have been actually perpetrated, and of which the bare\r\nrecital would fill the minds of a British jury with the liveliest\r\nsentiments of compassion and sympathy for the oppressed, and of\r\nhorror and indignation against the oppressor. Leaseholds\r\ncancelled, houses demolished without the smallest compensation,\r\non the plea of public utility, but in reality from motives of\r\nprivate hatred and revenge; freemen imprisoned on arbitrary\r\nwarrants issued without reference to the magistracy, and even\r\npublicly flogged in the same illegal and oppressive manner: such\r\nwere the events that crowded the government of a wretch, whom it\r\nwould be as superfluous to name, as it is needless to hold him up\r\nto the execration of posterity* If such an immortality were, as\r\nit appears to have been, the object of his pursuit, he has\r\ncompletely attained it. Almost at his very offset in life, he\r\nacquired a notoriety which has increased through all the\r\nsubsequent sinuosities of his career. Not content with pushing\r\nthe discipline of the service to which he belonged, in itself\r\nsufficiently severe, to its extreme verge, by an excess of\r\nvexatious brutality, he goaded into mutiny a crew of noble-minded\r\nfellows, the greater part of whom it has been since discovered,\r\npined away their existence on a desolate island, lost to their\r\ncountry and themselves, the sad victims of an unavailing remorse.\r\nYet there is one of them still living, who has since fully\r\nevinced his devotedness for his country's glory, and has been\r\ndeservedly raised to that elevated rank in her service, which but\r\nfor him many more might have lived to attain. Despised by his\r\nequals in his profession, and detested by his inferiors, he was\r\ncontradistinguished from other worthy officers of the same name,\r\nby prefixing to his _that_ of the vessel which was the scene\r\nof this act of insubordination, in the event the grave of many a\r\nnoble spirit, that might otherwise have proved an honour to\r\nthemselves and a credit to their country. The brutal tyranny that\r\ncharacterised his conduct on this occasion, would have alone\r\nsufficed to brand him with the imputation of \"coward,\" had it\r\nbeen even unconnected with the many subsequent acts of oppression\r\nwhich have stamped his career, and of which it is to be hoped for\r\nthe prevention of future monsters, that the infamy will long\r\nsurvive the records. The 26th of January, 1808, the memorable day\r\nwhen, by the spontaneous impulse of a united colony, he was\r\narrested; and fortunate for the cause of humanity is it that he\r\nwas then arrested, for ever** in the perpetration of the most\r\natrocious outrages that ever disgraced the representative of a\r\nfree government, has substantiated his claim to this character\r\nbeyond the possibility of doubt. Dreading the resentment of the\r\npeople whom he had so often and so wantonly oppressed, and having\r\non his back that uniform which was never so dishonoured before,\r\nhe skulked under a servant's bed in an obscure chamber of his\r\nhouse, but was at length discovered in this disgraceful hole, and\r\nconducted pale, trembling, and covered with flue,*** before the\r\nofficer who had commanded his arrest; nor could this gentleman's\r\nrepeated assurances that no violence should be offered his\r\nperson, convince him for a considerable time that his life was in\r\nsafety from the vengeance of the populace: so conscious was he of\r\nthe enormity of his conduct, and of the justice of an immediate\r\nand exemplary retaliation.\r\n\r\n[* The following anecdote, for the authenticity of\r\nwhich I pledge myself, will afford a better illustration of this\r\nmonster's character, than whole pages of general declamation and\r\ninvective. At the period of his government cattle were very\r\nscarce in the colony, and the stockholders were very tenacious of\r\nallowing their cows to be milked, from the injury which it did\r\nthe calves. Milk was in consequence a great rarity; but as the\r\ngovernor, naturally enough, did not choose to forego any of the\r\ngood things of this life, particularly whenever it was in his\r\noption to obtain them without any expence, he had always a number\r\nof cattle from the government herds, to furnish a supply of it\r\nfor his household. The surplus he generously distributed among\r\nhis favourites. One of these was a gentleman belonging to the\r\nmedical staff, who used in common with all those permitted the\r\nsame indulgence, to send his servant daily for his share of this\r\nprecious fluid. This unfortunate wight happened to go one morning\r\na little too late; and whether the person charged with the\r\ndistribution of this milk had been a little too liberal in his\r\ndonations to such of the gentlemen's servants as had attended in\r\ndue time, or whether the cows did not give their usual quantity\r\nthat morning, there was not a drop left for him on his arrival.\r\nNot reflecting that this disappointment was occasioned by his own\r\nnegligence, he ventured to make some remarks, such as \"he did not\r\nknow why his master should not have his share as well as another\r\ngentleman, etc. etc.\" which proved so highly disagreeable to the\r\nfeelings of the great man who administered this highly important\r\noffice, that he immediately went and complained to the still\r\ngreater man who had invested him with it. This august personage\r\nnot only feelingly participated in the insult which had been\r\noffered his faithful domestic, but also vowed that he should have\r\nthe most ample satisfaction. He accordingly ordered the\r\ncomplainant to send the offending party into his presence on the\r\nfollowing morning; strictly enjoining him before hand, to take\r\nespecial care that he should remain ignorant of the chastisement\r\nwhich was in petto for him. The next morning when the poor fellow\r\ncame as usual for his master's quota of milk, he was told by the\r\ngreat man whom he had the day before unwittingly offended, that\r\nthe governor desired to speak to him. Wondering that so\r\ndistinguished a personage should even know that so humble a being\r\nas himself was in existence, and at a loss to conjecture what\r\ncould be his gracious will and pleasure, he was ushered trembling\r\ninto his dread presence. In an instant his alarms were quieted.\r\nThe governor told him with a condescending smile, that as the\r\nchief constable's house was in his way home, he had merely sent\r\nfor him to be the bearer of a letter to that person, from a\r\ndesire to spare his dragoon the trouble of carrying it. The poor\r\nfellow, of course, delivered the letter with all haste, little\r\nimagining what were its contents. When the chief constable\r\nperused it, he ordered out the triangles; the poor wretch was\r\ninstantly tied up to them, and in a stupor of surprise and\r\nconsternation underwent the punishment, (whether twenty-five or\r\nfifty lashes I am not sure) which was ordered to be given him,\r\nwithout any explanation till after its infliction, of the reasons\r\nwhy he received it. Was not this a refinement of cruelty worthy\r\nthe most atrocious monster of antiquity?]\r\n\r\n[** When I wrote this part of the present work the\r\nperson to whom it has reference was living; and the only\r\nalteration which I have made in it since his death, has been the\r\nnecessary changes in the tenses of the verbs. My assertions have\r\nbeen scrupulously regulated by truth; but I am still aware that\r\nthey might have been pronounced libellous in a court of justice;\r\nand I have been advised by some of my friends to cancel them, on\r\nthe ground that the recollection of injuries should not be\r\nprolonged beyond the grave. The applicability, however, of this\r\nprinciple to private resentments is not more evident, than its\r\ninapplicability to public. The tomb which ought to be the goal of\r\nthe one, is the starting-post of the other. It is the legitimate\r\nprovince, nay, more, one of the most sacred duties of the\r\nannalist to speak of public characters after their deaths, with\r\nthat severity of reprobation or of praise, to which their conduct\r\nin public life may have entitled them. Have not all impartial\r\nbiographers and historians acted on this principle? And shall I\r\nbe deterred from following so just and salutary an example? If\r\nwhen death has set his seal upon a man's actions, and when the\r\nevil which he has committed is irremediable, the voice of censure\r\nis still to be silent, when, I may ask, ought it to be heard? Had\r\nsuch an ill-judged forbearance been practised by historians,\r\nwould the world have known that any tyrants, except those who may\r\nexist at the present epoch, or who may have existed within the\r\nreach of memory or of tradition, ever infested the earth? Would\r\nnot the enormities of the Dionysii, of Caligula, and of Nero,\r\nhave been long since forgotten? And would not many of those\r\nprinces who have merited and obtained the appellations of\r\n\"great,\" of \"good,\" and of \"just,\" have become as atrocious\r\nmonsters as _these_ were, but from the dread of being held\r\nup as objects of similar execration to posterity? The tyrant,\r\nindeed, whose conduct I would stamp with merited detestation,\r\nmoved, fortunately for the interests of mankind, in a humbler\r\nsphere, and therefore, his atrocities have a greater tendency to\r\nsink into premature oblivion. But is it a less sacred duty to\r\ntake all such steps as may be calculated to deter his successors\r\nfrom treading in his footsteps; because they will only have\r\n_thousands_ to trample upon instead of _millions_?\r\nOught not oppression in every community, whether great or small,\r\nto be discouraged by every possible means? And what means are so\r\nlikely to effect this end, and to prevent these secondary tyrants\r\nfrom sneaking out of the pages of record and recollection, as to\r\nproject their memories red-hot from the sun of public\r\nindignation, with a long fiery train of inextinguishable\r\nignominy, which may serve to point out their tracks; and to\r\nrender them for ever glaring objects of dread and execration, not\r\nonly to the planet of which they may have proved the bane, but to\r\nthe whole system encircled by their orbits? In persevering,\r\ntherefore, in the remarks which I made on this man's actions when\r\nhe was living, it is my conscientious belief that I have only\r\nacquitted myself of an imperative duty; and that I should have\r\nbeen guilty of a gross dereliction of it, had I done otherwise.\r\nOn this conviction, unalloyed by any baser impulse, I rest the\r\ndefence of my conduct; should there be any of my readers, who may\r\nbe inclined to view it in the same unjustifiable light as it is\r\nregarded by some few of my friends.]\r\n\r\n[*** See Lieutenant-Colonel Johnstone's\r\ncourt-martial.]\r\n\r\nThe instance of this man's conduct, is, I am willing to allow,\r\nan aggravated one, and such as it is to be hoped for the honour\r\nof our species would be rarely repeated. That it has occurred is,\r\nhowever, sufficient to demonstrate the impropriety of confiding\r\nunlimited power to any individual in future. The mere possession,\r\nindeed, of such vast authority, is calculated to vitiate the\r\nheart, and to engender tyranny; nor are examples wanting in\r\nhistory of persons, who though models of virtue and moderation in\r\nprivate stations, yet became the most bloody and atrocious\r\ntyrants on their elevation to supreme power. So great, indeed, is\r\nthe fallibility of human nature, that the very best of us are apt\r\nto deviate from that just mean, in the adherence to which\r\nconsists virtue. All governments, therefore, should provide\r\nagainst this capital defect; they should be so constituted as not\r\nonly to have in view what should happen, but also what might;\r\npossibilities should be contemplated as well as probabilities.\r\nThe power to do good should if possible be unlimited: the ability\r\nto do evil, followed with the highest responsibility, and\r\nrestrained by a moral certainty of punishment. An authority such\r\nas the governor of this colony possesses, might be tolerated\r\nunder a despotic government; but it is a disgrace to one that\r\npiques itself on its freedom. What plea can be urged for\r\nencouraging excesses in our possessions abroad, that would be\r\nvisited with condign punishment in our courts at home? Are those\r\nwho quit the habitations of their fathers, to extend the limits\r\nand resources of the empire, deserving of no better recompence\r\nthan a total suspension of the rights and liberties which their\r\nancestors have bequeathed them? Are they on their arrival in\r\nthese remote shores, to meet with no one of the institutions,\r\nwhich they have been taught to cherish and to reverence? If the\r\nwant, indeed, of these institutions, of which so many centuries\r\nhave attested the wisdom, had as yet been productive of no evil,\r\nthere might be some excuse offered for the withholding of them;\r\nbut after such a scandalous abuse of authority, the colonists\r\nexpected, and had a right to expect, that no subsequent governor\r\nwould have been appointed without the intervention of some\r\ncontrolling power, which, while it should tend to strengthen the\r\nexecntive in the due discharge of its functions, might at the\r\nsame time protect the subject in the legitimate exercise and\r\nenjoyment of his private and personal rights. Never was there a\r\nperiod since the foundation of the colony, when the impolicy of\r\nits present form of government was so strikingly manifest; and\r\nnever, perhaps, will there be an occasion, when the establishment\r\nof a house of assembly, and of trial by jury, would have been\r\nhailed with such enthusiastic joy and gratitude: and accordingly\r\nthe disappointment of the colonists was extreme, when on the\r\narrival of Governor Macquarie, it was found that the same unwise\r\nand unconstitutional power, which had been the cause of the late\r\nconfusion and anarchy was continued in all its pristine vigor;\r\nand that he was uncontrolled even by the creation of a\r\ncouncil.\r\n\r\nI would here have it most distinctly understood that I do not\r\nmean to cast the slightest imputation on the conduct of this\r\ngentleman, whom his majesty's ministers selected with so much\r\ndiscrimination in this delicate and embarrassing conjuncture. The\r\nmanner in which he has discharged, during a period of more than\r\nnine years, the important functions confided to him, has\r\ncompletely justified the high opinion that was formed of his\r\nmoderation and ability. He has fully proved that he had no need\r\nof any controlling power,* to keep him in the path of honour and\r\nduty; and has raised the colony, by his single prudence and\r\ndiscretion, to as high a pitch of prosperity, as it perhaps could\r\nhave attained, in so short a period, under such a paralysing form\r\nof government. But it has not been in his power to benefit the\r\ncolony to the extent which he has contemplated and desired; many\r\nof the projects which he has submitted to the consideration of\r\nhis majesty's ministers, have not obtained their approval. It\r\nwould appear, indeed, that the very parent, to whom this strange\r\nunconstitutional monster owes its birth and existence, is\r\ndistrustful of her hideous progeny; and that by way of securing\r\nthe people whom she has suffered it to govern against the\r\nunlimited devastations which it might be tempted to commit, she\r\nhas prohibited it from moving out of certain bounds, without her\r\nprevious concurrence and authority. The wisdom of this precaution\r\nhas been sufficiently manifested by the terrible excesses which\r\nit has committed within the sphere of this circumscribed\r\njurisdiction. If its conduct, with the possession of this\r\nimperfect degree of liberty has been atrocious, it cannot be\r\ndifficult to conceive to what lengths an unlimited power of\r\naction might have tempted it to proceed. Still there can be no\r\ndoubt that this state of restraint, on the one hand so salutary\r\nand provident, has on the other occasioned much injury, and\r\nprevented the adoption of many measures of the highest urgency\r\nand importance to the welfare of the colony. Among these the\r\nfailure of Governor Macquarie's attempt to procure the sanction\r\nof his majesty's ministers for the erection of distilleries, is\r\nperhaps the most justly to be deplored.\r\n\r\n[* Since I wrote this encomium on Governor\r\nMacquarie's administration, a petition from some few individuals,\r\ncomplaining of and enumerating several acts of oppression, said\r\nto have been committed towards them by this gentleman, has been\r\npresented to the House of Commons by Mr. Brougham. The honourable\r\nand learned member did not, however, choose to pledge himself for\r\nthe correctness of the allegations set forth in this petition;\r\nand therefore, until they are substantiated, the gentleman whose\r\nconduct has been thus impeached, ought to be considered as\r\ninnocent of the charges preferred against him. If the event,\r\nhowever, should prove that they are founded in truth, the fact\r\nwill only afford an additional proof of the demoralizing\r\ninfluence of arbitrary authority on the minds of those who\r\npossess it, and of the impolicy of suffering the present form of\r\ngovernment to continue in force a single hour beyond the period\r\nnecessary for its supercession. Never was there a more humane and\r\nupright man than Governor Macquarie; and if the power with which\r\nhe has been for so many years intrusted, has indeed at length\r\npropelled him beyond the bounds of moderation and justice, it may\r\nbe safely asserted that there are but very few men in existence\r\nwhom it would not have tempted to commit a similar\r\nindiscretion.]\r\n\r\nFrom the period* at which this colony was able to raise a\r\nsufficiency of grain for its consumption, the adoption of this\r\nmeasure has been imperatively called for by the wants and\r\ncircumstances of its inhabitants; and it is to so palpable an\r\nomission, that the constant succession of abundance and scarcity,\r\nwhich, to the astonishment of many inquiring persons, has for the\r\nlast fifteen years alternately prevailed there, is mainly\r\nascribable. So long as the necessities of the government were\r\ngreater than the means of the colonists to administer to them,\r\nthe productive powers of this settlement developed themselves\r\nwith a degree of rapidity which furnishes the surest criterion of\r\nits fertility and importance. But from the moment this impulse\r\nwas checked, from the instant the supply exceeded the demand, the\r\ncolony may be said to have continued stationary, with respect to\r\nits agriculture; producing in favourable seasons, somewhat more\r\nthan enough grain for its consumption, but in unfavourable ones,\r\nwhether arising from drought, or flood, falling so greatly\r\ndeficient in its supply, that recourse has been invariably had to\r\nIndia, in order to guarantee its inhabitants from the horrors of\r\nfamine, which have so often stared them in the face; and to\r\nwhich, but for such salutary precaution, the majority of them\r\nmust have long ago fallen victims. These dreadful deficiencies\r\nhave been the natural and inevitable result of a want of market;\r\nsince no person will expend his time and means in producing that\r\nwhich will not ensure him an adequate return for his pains. So\r\nlong, therefore, as other channels of industry, yielding a more\r\ncertain compensation for labour, were open, the colonist would\r\nnaturally prefer such more profitable occupation, to the\r\ncomparatively precarious and unproductive culture of his land;\r\nand it was accordingly found, that many, who had till then\r\ndevoted their sole attention to agriculture, abandoned at this\r\nperiod all tillage but such as was necessary for the support of\r\ntheir households, and employed the funds which they had acquired\r\nby the former successful cultivation of their farms, in the\r\npurchase and rearing of cattle, which continued a certain\r\nlucrative employment, long after agricultural produce had become\r\nof a depreciated and precarious value. The reason why these two\r\nbranches of husbandry did not keep pace in this as in other\r\ncountries, is obvious, from the remoteness of its situation,\r\nwhich rendered the conveyance of cattle thither so extremely\r\ndifficult and expensive, that but a very limited supply of them\r\nwas furnished, in comparison with its necessities. The increase,\r\ntherefore, of these cattle could only be proportionate to their\r\nnumber; while no bounds were as yet assigned to the extension of\r\nagriculture, but, on the contrary, the whole combined energies of\r\nthe colonists directed to this single channel, by the great\r\ndemand which existed for their produce. Not but that the rearing\r\nof cattle was from the commencement equally, and indeed far more\r\nprofitable than the cultivation of the land; but their exorbitant\r\nprice excluded all but a few great capitalists from embarking in\r\nso profitable an undertaking; while, on the contrary, a stock of\r\nprovisions with a few axes and hoes, and a good pair of hands to\r\nwield them, were the principal requisites for an agricultural\r\nestablishment; and, indeed, in the early period of this\r\nsettlement, all these essentials were supplied the colonists by\r\nthe liberality of the government, till sufficient time had\r\nelapsed for the application of the produce of their farms to\r\ntheir own support.\r\n\r\n[* This epoch may be dated so far back as 1804: the\r\nharvest of that year was so abundant, and the surplus of grain so\r\nextensive, that no sale could be had for more than one half of\r\nthe crop. During the greater part of the following year, wheat\r\nsold at prices scarcely sufficient to cover the expence of\r\nreaping, thrashing, and carrying it to market; pigs and other\r\nstock were fed upon it; and these two years of such extraordinary\r\nabundance involved the whole agricultural body in the greatest\r\ndistress; grain was then their only property, and it was of so\r\nlittle value that it was invariably rejected by their creditors\r\nin payment of their debts. The consequence was that it was wasted\r\nand neglected in the most shocking manner; scarcely any person\r\nwould give it house room, and had the harvest of the following\r\nyear proved equally abundant, the majority of the settlers must\r\nhave abandoned their farms, and sought for other employment.\r\nFortunately, however, for the agricultural interests, the great\r\nflood of 1806 intervened to prevent the impending desertion; the\r\nold and the new stocks on the banks of the Hawkesbury and Nepean\r\nwere all swept away, and thus for a few years afterwards the\r\nsupply of grain was pretty nearly kept on a level with the demand\r\nfor it.]\r\n\r\nBut to return to the epoch when the supply of corn became too\r\ngreat for the demand, and when, as has been already noticed, some\r\npart of those who till then had been exclusively engaged in\r\nagriculture, turned their attention to the more beneficial\r\noccupation of rearing cattle; still the secession of these, who\r\nformed but a very inconsiderable member of the agricultural body,\r\nin consequence of the enormous price of cattle even at that\r\nperiod, and the great capital which it consequently required to\r\nbecome a stock-holder to any extent, afforded but a very trivial\r\nrelief to those who adhered from necessity to their original\r\nemployment. In this conjuncture, therefore, many of the next\r\nricher class abandoned their farms, and with the funds which they\r\nwere enabled to collect, set up shops or public-houses in Sydney.\r\nThis town was at that time the more favourable to such\r\nundertakings, in consequence of the brisk commerce carried on\r\nwith China, by means of American and India-built vessels, that\r\nwere in part owned by the colonial merchants, and procured sandal\r\nwood in the Fegee Islands, at a trifling expense, which they\r\ncarried direct to China, and bartered for return cargoes of\r\nconsiderable value. The Seal Islands too, which were discovered\r\nto the southward of the colony, furnished about the same period,\r\nan extensive and lucrative employment for the colonial craft, and\r\ncontributed not less than the sandal wood trade to the\r\nflourishing condition of this port. It was also about this time\r\nthat the valuable whale fisheries, which the adjacent seas\r\nafford, were first attempted; but repeated experiment has proved\r\nthat the duties which are levied, as well in this country as in\r\nthe colony, on oil procured in colonial vessels, amount to a\r\ncomplete prohibition. Many of the merchants, whose enterprising\r\nspirit prompted them to repeated efforts, in order to bear up\r\nagainst the overwhelming weight of these duties, have found to\r\ntheir cost, that they are an insuperable obstacle to the\r\nsuccessful prosecution of these fisheries, which would otherwise\r\nprove an inexhaustible source of wealth to the colony, and\r\nprovide a permanent outlet for its redundant population. These\r\ntwo branches of commerce, so long as they were followed, afforded\r\na support to great numbers of the colonists, and rendered the\r\nshock which the agricultural body had sustained, less sensible\r\nand alarming. I say these two, because the third has never been\r\nprosecuted but with loss; and has, in fact, proved a vortex which\r\nhas devoured a great part of the profits which the othertwo\r\nyielded. For some years, however, these two channels have been so\r\ncompletely drained, that they are only at present pursued by\r\ndesperate adventurers, who seldom or never obtain a return\r\ncommensurate with the risk they run, and the capital they employ.\r\nBut even during the period of their utmost productiveness, the\r\nnumber of persons who were immediately engaged in them, or who\r\nabandoned the plough to place themselves behind the counter, was\r\nfar from providing a remedy for the disease of the agricultural\r\nbody: because in the former instance these two branches of\r\ncommerce were only capable of affording employment to a limited\r\npopulation; and in the latter a capital was necessary, not so\r\ngreat indeed as had been required to enter successfully on the\r\ngrazing system, but yet far more considerable than it was in the\r\nability of the majority of the colonists to raise. By these\r\nmigrations, therefore, the pressure and embarrassment of the\r\nagricultural body, which by this time had gradually lost the\r\nrichest and most respectable portion of its members, was but\r\nlittle, if indeed at all alleviated; and some other expedient\r\nbecame everyday more and more necessary to be adopted by those\r\nwho remained. In this exigency many abandoned their farms\r\naltogether, and hired themselves as servants to such richer\r\nindividuals as had occasion for their services; while others, and\r\nundoubtedly the greater part of them, cultivated but a small\r\nportion of their land, and afterwards travelled in search of\r\nlabour till harvest time, at which period they returned, reaped,\r\nthreshed, and disposed of their crops, and after recultivating\r\nthe same spot, sought, during the rest of the year, employment as\r\nbefore, wherever it could be found. This is the mode of life\r\nwhich a great number of the poor settlers pursue to this day.\r\n\r\nBut the effect of these entire, or partial secessions from the\r\nagricultural body, was not so extensively beneficial as might at\r\nfirst be imagined. All this time the population was in a state of\r\nrapid progression, both from the daily influx of people from\r\nwithout, and from the amazing fecundity of the colonists within.\r\nThe distress, therefore, of the colony continued increasing in\r\nproportion to its increasing population. And although it may\r\nappear strange, that while it was a subject of such notoriety,\r\nthat the settlers were already too numerous for the occasions of\r\nthe colony, fresh volunteers should crowd to enrol themselves\r\nunder their banners; this surprise will cease when it is stated,\r\nthat the settling of new lands was for many years a matter of\r\ntraffic between the government and the colonists, by which, as it\r\nis natural to conclude, the former were no great gainers. It was\r\ntheir policy, and undoubtedly necessary in the early stages of\r\nthe settlement, and even at present under proper restrictions, to\r\nencourage the extension of agriculture generally, but more\r\nparticularly in the inland districts, that are not subject to\r\nflood; and to this end it was customary to support new settlers\r\nwith their wives, families, and servants, for eighteen months, at\r\nthe expense of the crown. The natural consequence was, that all\r\nwho had become free, either by the expiration of their servitude,\r\nby conditional emancipation, or by absolute pardon, and who had\r\nno means of support, embraced this offer of the government, which\r\nassured them a subsistence that enabled them to seek at their\r\nleisure for a more lucrative occupation elsewhere. Nor are these\r\npoor creatures who thus profited by the liberality of the\r\ngovernment with an intention to abuse it, to be too harshly\r\ncondemned: still less so are those who, arriving strangers in the\r\ncolony, and having in most instances wives and families, the\r\nsupport of whom in inactivity would be daily consuming their\r\nlittle all, embraced this the only immediate mode of subsistence\r\nthat occurred to them. These people, as soon as the helping hand\r\nof the government was withdrawn, and it became incumbent on them\r\nto depend on their own proper resources, would be immediately\r\nsubject to the same privation and misery which pressed on their\r\nbody, and would consequently be under the necessity of resorting\r\nto the same expedients for relief. The great increase which has\r\ntaken place of late years to the cleared lands in the colony, has\r\nbeen the result of this system, and not the gradual progressive\r\noperation of a flourishing agriculture. This assertion I consider\r\nfully borne out by a comparison between the quantity of land\r\ncleared, and the quantity in cultivation. By the last return from\r\nthe colony, taken so late as November, 1817, it appears that\r\nthere are 47,564 acres of cleared land, out of which only 32,814\r\nare cropped; 14,750 acres, therefore, (or nearly one-half of what\r\nis in cultivation) are lying waste: a circumstance which can only\r\nbe accounted for in this manner, since the system of fallowing\r\nland is not in practice. It must therefore be evident, that the\r\nclearing of so great a portion of land over and above what is\r\nrequired by the situation and wants of the colonists, must have\r\nbeen effected by unnatural means. The increase of produce has\r\nnot, indeed, outstepped the growth of population, but it has kept\r\npace with it, and all the cleared land which is not employed in\r\nthe raising of this produce, has evidently been a useless\r\nexpenditure of labour.\r\n\r\nThus this copious afflux of new colonists into the uninhabited\r\ndistricts in the interior, which had hitherto been exclusively\r\noccupied by the flocks and herds of the graziers, did not produce\r\nthat permanent advantage which the enormous expense incurred by\r\nthe government in their outfit, ought to have insured. At the\r\nsame time it was of the most undoubted injury to the\r\nstock-holders, by preventing them from allowing their cattle to\r\nroam at large during the night, from the danger of trespass and\r\npoundage, which the indiscriminate dispersion of small\r\nagricultural establishments over the whole face of the country,\r\nwithout fences of any description to protect them, every where\r\noccasioned. To be sure, the colonists will have derived this very\r\nmaterial advantage from the great quantity of cleared land, now\r\nlying waste; that whenever the pernicious policy, which has\r\nparalysed their energies, and blasted the general prosperity,\r\nshall be relinquished, and a judicious system of encouragement\r\nsubstituted in its stead, they will instantly be prepared to\r\nprofit by the capabilities which the wisdom and justice of the\r\nparent government shall have at length afforded them.\r\n\r\nBut the future increase in the cleared lands will not be\r\nproportioned to the past, because directions have of late been\r\ntransmitted from this country, to allow future colonists only six\r\nmonths provisions from the king's stores, for themselves and\r\ntheir households, instead of eighteen months, as heretofore. This\r\nvery material diminution in the measure of encouragement held out\r\nto future colonization, will clearly be attended with a threefold\r\noperation. It will be a grievous disadvantage to such respectable\r\npersons as emigrate from this country, with a real intention, but\r\nwith funds scarcely adequate to a permanent settlement in the\r\ncolony; it will still further discourage the existing\r\nagriculturist and grazier, by lessening the demand of the\r\ngovernment for their produce; and it will increase the general\r\nembarrassment, both by narrowing this channel of employment,\r\nwhich was supplied by the liberality of the government, and by\r\ncurtailing the means of the colonists at large to provide labour\r\nfor that part of the population, which will be thus turned loose\r\non them twelvemonths sooner than usual.\r\n\r\nTo the credit of the present governor it must be allowed that\r\nhe has done all that a benevolent heart and a sagacious head\r\ncould dictate, to counteract the growing distress and misery. He\r\nhas exhausted all the means in his power to give employment to\r\nthe large portion of unoccupied labour, which it has not been\r\nwithin the compass of individual enterprize to absorb. He has\r\neffected the greatest improvements in the capital, by enlarging\r\nand straightening the streets, and by erecting various public\r\nedifices of the highest utility and ornament. The same\r\nsuperintending hand is visible throughout all the inferior towns\r\nand townships, many of which indeed are of his own foundation. He\r\nhas made highways to every cultivated district, thus affording\r\nthe inhabitants of them the greatest facilities for the cheap and\r\nexpeditious conveyance of their produce to market. In fine,\r\nthroughout every part of the colony and its dependent settlements\r\nat the Derwent and Port Dalrymple, he has effected improvements\r\nwhich will long continue monuments of the wisdom and liberality\r\nof their author. But it cannot be denied, however beneficial\r\nthese and other improvements of the same nature which are in\r\nprogress may be, either with respect to their immediate or more\r\nremote consequences, that they are but mere temporary sources of\r\nalleviation, whose benignant supply will cease with the discharge\r\nof the great body of workmen whom they at present maintain in\r\nactivity. This, indeed, as well as all the other expedients which\r\nI have already enumerated, as having been practised in order to\r\nfind outlets for the superabundant labour, have been productive\r\nof no permanent result.\r\n\r\nThis assertion is satisfactorily substantiated by the present\r\nunnatural efforts of the colonists in the establishment of\r\nvarious manufactories, particularly those of cloth and hats. I\r\nsay unnatural, because in the common course of things, the origin\r\nof such establishments ought to be coeval only with an entire\r\noccupation of the soil, and redundancy of population. And this\r\nchiefly for two reasons: because a greater capital is required in\r\ntheir foundation, and a greater degree of skill and dexterity in\r\ntheir developement. It is on this account that in Canada, and our\r\ncolonies in the West Indies, which are in a great measure left to\r\nthe guidance of their native legislatures, and which it is\r\ntherefore to be presumed, adopt that line of policy at once most\r\nconsistent with their own interests, and with those of the parent\r\ncountry, since in the persons of her representatives, she\r\napproves or annuls their proceedings, we find that manufactures\r\nhave been altogether neglected, while their agriculture and\r\nplantations, while, in fine, the exportation of raw materials,\r\nwhether the natural or artificial productions of these colonies,\r\nhas been promoted in every possible manner. That this is the\r\nsystem which ought to have been pursued, we have a still more\r\nforcible proof in the instance of the United States of America,\r\nand of many of the ancient nations of Europe; which, unfettered\r\nby any dependence whatever on any foreign power, and having\r\nconsequently adopted that policy, which has been found the most\r\nconsistent with their respective interests, have made but very\r\nlittle progress in manufactures, and are therefore still under\r\nthe necessity of having recourse for manufactured commodities to\r\nother countries. If then the promotion of agriculture be more\r\npolitic in many independent states, which have not yet attained\r\nthe same maturity of growth and civilization, that characterize\r\nthe principal manufacturing nations of the world, by how much\r\nmore prudent must the encouragement of it be in a dependent\r\ncolony like this; possessed as it is of all the requisites for an\r\nunlimited extension of its agriculture in the fertility of its\r\nsoil, the benignity of its climate, and the extent of its\r\nterritory, and wanting all the essentials for the production of\r\nmanufactures, skill, capital, and population?\r\n\r\nThe existing state of things, therefore, is not only contrary\r\nto the welfare of the colony itself, but also in diametrical\r\nopposition to the interests of the parent country. A great\r\nmanufacturing nation herself, it is her undoubted policy, and\r\nthat which on every occasion I believe but the present she has\r\npursued, to augment in her colonies, at one and the same time,\r\nthe consumption of her own _manufactures_, and the growth of\r\nsuch productions as she has found essential to her own use, or to\r\nthe supply of other nations. The toleration, therefore, of a\r\nsystem so averse to her acknowledged interests, can only be\r\nattributed to ignorance, or inadvertence. But it is not in the\r\nforcible abolition of these manufactories, created by necessity,\r\nand still rendered indispensable by the same irresistible law,\r\nthat the condition of the colony is to be ameliorated or\r\nredressed. So long as the same pernicious disabilities which have\r\nalready reduced the colonists to beggary and despair, and\r\nrendered unavailing the resources of a country that might rival\r\nin the number and value of its exports, the most favoured of the\r\nglobe are enforced, this manufacturing system is a lamentable but\r\nnecessary evil. After putting it out of their power to purchase\r\nthe more costly clothing of the mother country, it would be an\r\nintolerable exercise of authority to prevent them from having\r\nrecourse to the homely products of their own industry and\r\ningenuity. Under existing circumstances, indeed, there is no\r\nalternative between permitting them the use of their own\r\nmanufactures, and compelling them to go naked, or to clothe\r\nthemselves like the aborigines of the country in the skins of\r\nanimals. There is but one remedy for the disease of the colony:\r\nit is to give due encouragement to agriculture, and to promote\r\nthe growth of exportable commodities, which its inhabitants may\r\noffer in exchange for the productions of other countries. The\r\nmanufacturing system which has begun to take root, will then\r\nwither away of its own accord; since it will then be the least\r\nproductive manner in which capital and labour can be\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nHappy would it have been for the colonists, if these repeated\r\nefforts, these distressing and embarrassing expedients to supply\r\ntheir wants, had been the only injurious consequences resulting\r\nfrom the stagnation of agriculture. The day when their wretched\r\nsituation shall have at length awakened the commiseration of the\r\nparent country, would then have witnessed the term and bounds of\r\ntheir sufferings. Alas! far different will be the case. Like a\r\nruined merchant, who would defer, to the utmost length, the\r\ndisgrace of bankruptcy, in the daily hope of some prosperous\r\nadventure to retrieve his fortune and restore his credit, the\r\nsettlers have gone on contracting debts, which have accumulated\r\nwith the increasing embarrassments of the community. The\r\nengagements of the majority of the cultivators, thus swelled in a\r\nfew years to a bulk, which they had no longer any chance of\r\nreducing: pressed on all sides by their creditors, the mortgage\r\nor sale of their farms became inevitable; and even these\r\nsacrifices have, in general, been far from cancelling their\r\nbonds; so that they not only have ceased to be proprietors, but\r\nalso still continue debtors to a large amount. Their creditors,\r\nin many instances, a set of rapacious, unprincipled dealers,\r\navailing themselves of the power which the law would give them\r\nover the personal liberty of these, their debtors, immediately\r\ntook that advantage of their own commanding position, which might\r\nhave been expected from their characters. They engaged, or more\r\nproperly speaking, constrained, these poor wretches to cultivate\r\nas tenants, the same soil which lately belonged to them, and\r\nexacted from them in return, a rent too exorbitant to be paid.\r\nEvery succeeding year, therefore, has but tended to increase\r\ntheir obligations, and they are, at present, identified with the\r\nsoil, and reduced to all intents and purposes, except in name, to\r\nas complete a state of vassalage as the serfs of Russia. If they\r\nshould be in need of any trifling supply, it is to their\r\nproprietors, and to them only, that they dare have recourse,\r\nthough they would be able to obtain the same articles a hundred\r\nper cent. cheaper elsewhere. To their granaries the whole produce\r\nof their industry is conveyed: and, in spite of all their toil\r\nand privation, far from discharging their original debts, they\r\nfind themselves every day more deeply involved. The more they\r\nstruggle, the more complicated and firm becomes their\r\nentanglement. Lamentable as undoubtedly must be such a hopeless\r\nstate of servitude, it still appears to them preferable to the\r\nprecincts of a prison. They respire the free invigorating air of\r\ntheir plains, and can still traverse them at their option, or at\r\nleast when the season arrives which closes their daily task. But\r\nthis privilege, it must be confessed, is purchased at its\r\nuttermost value. We have philanthropists among us, who justly\r\ncommiserate the condition of that unoffending race of people, who\r\ndragged from the scenes of their nativity, and the habitations of\r\ntheir fathers, have been consigned by a gang of merciless\r\nkidnappers to perpetual slavery themselves, and to the still more\r\nintolerable necessity of bequeathing an existence of similar\r\nendurement and degradation to their offspring. After years of\r\nstrenuous indefatigable exertion these friends of humanity, these\r\nnoble champions of liberty have succeeded, if not in emancipating\r\nthose, who had already been consigned to this unmerited doom, at\r\nleast in preventing the further extension of this infernal\r\ntraffic. Would it not be an effort worthy the same philanthropy,\r\nwhich has thus secured the protection and deliverance of\r\nunoffending Africa, to procure the emancipation of suffering\r\nAustralasia? to raise her from the abject state of poverty,\r\nslavery, and degradation, to which she is so fast sinking, and to\r\npresent her a constitution, which may gradually conduct her to\r\nfreedom, prosperity, and happiness?\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that this state of slavery, so galling to\r\nthe subjects of a free country, has been in some measure imposed\r\non the colonists by their own imprudent extravagance. Already but\r\ntoo much inclined by their early habits of irregularity to\r\nlicentious indulgence, the prosperous state of their affairs\r\nduring the first fifteen years after the foundation of the\r\nsettlement, presented the strongest inducements to a revival of\r\ntheir ancient propensities, which had been repressed, but not\r\nsubdued. Imagining that the same unlimited market, which was then\r\noffered for their produce, would always continue, they only\r\nthought of consuming the fruits of their industry; not doubting\r\nthat the same fields, which thus lavishly administered to the\r\ngratification of their desires, would amply suffice for the more\r\nmoderate enjoyments of their offspring. But when once their\r\nproduce began to exceed the demand of the government, and when in\r\na short time afterwards from the want of due encouragement, all\r\nthe various avenues of industry that lay open were successively\r\nfilled, and the means of occupation eithergreatly circumscribed,\r\nor entirely exhausted, these people, so long habituated to\r\nunrestrained indulgence, found it difficult to support that\r\nprivation, which became incumbent on their condition; and in\r\norder to procure those luxuries of which they so severely felt\r\nthe want, exhausted their credit, and ended by alienating their\r\npossessions. There can be but little doubt if the colonists,\r\ninstead of expending, had providently accumulated the money which\r\nthey so profusely acquired during the period of their\r\nagricultural prosperity, that their actual situation would have\r\nbeen far preferable; for, though the gradual retrogradation,\r\nwhich I should imagine it must at present be sufficiently\r\nevident, that the colony has been undergoing for these last\r\nfifteen years, would by this time have greatly diminished, if not\r\nhave totally absorbed their former savings, still their lands\r\nwould have remained to them, nor would they have been reduced to\r\nthat state of vassalage and misery, which they are this day\r\nenduring. Lamentable therefore, as is their condition, the\r\nconsideration that it has thus far been occasioned by their own\r\nimprudence, is apt to detract from that unbounded commiseration\r\nwhich it would otherwise excite: if, on the other hand, we do not\r\nreflect in extenuation of their thoughtlessness and extravagance,\r\nthat their former increased means of indulgence, were the result\r\nof their industry; that this industry was in the first instance\r\ncalled into activity by the encouragement of the government; that\r\nit has since been paralysed by a concatenation of unwise and\r\nunjust disabilities imposed by the same power; and that\r\nconsequently their present wretched and degraded situation is not\r\nso much to be ascribed to their former improvidence as to the\r\nactual impolicy and injustice of their rulers. If we furthermore\r\nconsider the short period in which this great change in their\r\ncircumstances has been effected, we shall feel convinced that so\r\nsudden a transition from affluence to poverty could not be\r\npatiently endured, and that every method of rendering so\r\nunexpected and galling a burthen more supportable, would be\r\nnaturally and inevitably resorted to. To prove still more\r\nsatisfactorily that this state of slavery to which so large a\r\nproportion of the original settlers are reduced, has not been so\r\nmuch the result of their own imprudence as of the impolicy of\r\ntheir government, numerous instances might be adduced of persons,\r\nnot indeed skilled in the arts of husbandry, whose habits have\r\nalways been regular and moderate, who have been for many years\r\nstockholders as well as agriculturists, and who, notwithstanding\r\nthis two-fold advantage, aided by an undeviating economy, have\r\nbeen unable to keep themselves free from the embarrassments in\r\nwhich the bare cultivators of the soil are so generally involved.\r\nTo what end then, has their frugality been directed, if a few\r\nyears more will engulph their possessions, and reduce them to the\r\nsame state of vassalage and degradation, to which their less\r\nprovident brethren are already subjected? They have, indeed, in\r\nthe prospective some short period of unexpired freedom; but I\r\ndoubt much whether the gradual approach of inevitable slavery be\r\nscarcely more enviable than slavery itself.\r\n\r\nThe great concussion which the agricultural interests thus\r\nsustained at the epoch when the productive powers of the colony\r\nexceeded the consumptive, and the continued shocks to which they\r\nhave been exposed ever since, have not unfortunately affected the\r\nagricultural prosperity alone, but have shaken to the foundation\r\nthe commercial edifice also. Unluckily both the agricultural and\r\ncommercial classes seem to have been alike ignorant of the\r\ndeath-blow which had been struck at their welfare. The settler\r\ncontinued in the same career of thoughtless extravagance which\r\nhis circumstances when they were even in their most flourishing\r\nstate had scarcely permitted, and the merchant went on without\r\nhesitation, advancing him goods in the hope of extricating his\r\nold customer from difficulties which he only imagined to be of\r\ntemporary pressure; never for a moment suspecting that they were\r\nthe forerunners of deeper embarrassment and ultimate ruin. Need I\r\nstate the consequences. The extended credits which the first\r\nmerchants thus gave the settlers on the strength of the\r\nprogressive increase of their produce, rendered them at last\r\nunable to fulfil the engagements which they had contracted with\r\nBritish and East India houses, and they were eventually involved\r\nin the destruction which had so suddenly overwhelmed the great\r\nmass of their debtors, on whom they were necessarily dependent\r\nfor support. All of them who had been distinguished by their\r\nequitable dealings, and by their liberality of conduct, received\r\nat this moment so rude a shock in their affairs that they have\r\nbeen unable amidst the increasing decadence of the community at\r\nlarge to re-establish their credit, and after disposing of the\r\nscattered wrecks of their fortune, have not only been reduced to\r\npenury, but are still indebted to their correspondents in the\r\namount perhaps of £100,000. These gentlemen thus driven\r\nfrom the commercial circle by their liberality, unwillingly\r\ninflicted a deadly wound on the credit of the colony. Foreign\r\nmerchants would no longer have any account dealings with their\r\nsuccessors; and generally ever since the commercial intercourse\r\nwith England and the East Indies has been maintained without any\r\nconfidence on the part of the merchants of these two countries;\r\nthe money has been received in one hand, and the goods delivered\r\nin the other. This cautious system has given birth to another\r\nrace of merchants, much more prudent than their predecessors, but\r\nalso much less serviceable to the colony, and much less adapted\r\nto its emergencies. These in their dealings have been forced to\r\nobserve the same circumspection which had been adopted towards\r\nthemselves, and have given no credit but to those whose means of\r\npayment were unquestionable. As the majority of the colonists\r\nhave been always in the back ground, since the epoch which I have\r\njust described, and have in consequence been unable to produce\r\nready money, a subordinate class of traders, but still superior\r\nin their circumstances and the extent of their transactions to\r\nthose little inferior dealers, who are to be found in all\r\ncountries, started up, and have since acted as intermediary\r\nagents between the importers and the great body of consumers. The\r\nobject of this class has been, and continues to be, not so much\r\nto realize large fortunes in money, which indeed under existing\r\ncircumstances would be scarcely possible, as to acquire immense\r\nlanded possessions: and their system, which, in fact, is the\r\nnatural consequence of this policy, is to require of the settlers\r\nmortgage securities anterior to the supply of such articles as\r\nthey may be in need of. As they are frequently unable punctually\r\nto comply with the conditions of these mortgages, their creditors\r\neagerly embrace the opportunity, whenever it offers, of\r\nforeclosing them, and are thus gradually becoming proprietors of\r\nthe finest estates in the colony; estates which whenever its\r\ncapabilities shall be called into unrestrained action will ensure\r\nthem and their posterity fortunes of a colossal magnitude. While\r\nthis class of traders are thus becoming the most considerable\r\nlandholders in this settlement, they have not only taken care not\r\nto give credit to such an extent as might occasion a diminution\r\nin their trading capital, but have even contrived to increase it\r\nvery materially. This system, therefore, of buying goods, and\r\nafterwards selling them at an almost arbitrary profit, the\r\ngreater part of which is thus converted into landed property, is\r\ndaily gaining ground, and will infallibly in the end, unless\r\nproper measures be speedily taken to counteract it, reduce the\r\ngreat majority of the agricultural body to the same state of\r\nvassalage which a large proportion of its members are already\r\nenduring. And what renders the increasing wealth and power of the\r\nsmall number who thus profit by the embarrassments of the\r\nsettlers, and make themselves masters of their persons and\r\nproperties, still more odious and galling, is the consideration\r\nthat in most instances they are the least deserving, and yet the\r\nonly class of the community to whom the present order of things\r\nis favourable. While all the rest of the population are groaning\r\nunder the aggravated pressure of toil, privation, and despair,\r\nthey are fattening on the surrounding misery, and every day\r\nmaking rapid strides towards the attainment of immense riches,\r\nunder the propitious shelter of a system which would appear to\r\nhave been expressly contrived for their especial aggrandisement,\r\nat the expence of the freedom, prosperity and happiness of the\r\nwhole social body besides. Like vultures, that in the midst of\r\ncombats soar in safety above the destruction raging beneath, but\r\ndescend at its close and tranquilly devour the mangled carcases\r\nwhich the exterminating engines of war have laid prostrate for\r\ntheir repast, these men out of the influence of the oppressive\r\ndisabilities which are overwhelming all but themselves, eagerly\r\nwatch the progress of the surrounding misery, and impatiently\r\nawait its completion; more cruel than vultures, since covered\r\nwith the aegis that has unnerved the force and paralysed the\r\nenergies of their neighbours, they introduce themselves into the\r\nmidst of the havoc of their own species, and prey upon the living\r\nvictims who are sinking around them.\r\n\r\nAnd here, it may not be inexpedient to reconcile the existence\r\nof so much distress, with so large an income, and so small a\r\npopulation as the colony and its dependent settlements are known\r\nto possess. The former, it has been seen, may be estimated in\r\nround numbers at £170,000, the latter at 20,000 souls: so\r\nthat if the annual income were equally divided among the entire\r\npopulation, and they were all agriculturists, and could furnish\r\nthemselves with food, (I make this supposition, because it is at\r\ntheir option to become agriculturists, and it is consequently a\r\nlegitimate inference, that it is not the interest of such as have\r\nnot embraced this alteration to do so) they would each have man,\r\nwoman, and child, 8l. 10s. yearly for the purchase\r\nof articles of foreign growth and manufacture alone. This I am\r\nready to allow, is comparatively a much larger sum than could be\r\nappropriated by the inhabitants of this country to similar\r\npurposes; and it would therefore appear on the first view,\r\nincompatible with the doleful picture of distress which I have\r\ndrawn. If, however, the remoteness of the colony from England,\r\nIndia, and China, the three principal supplying countries, be\r\nduly considered, and the great expence of freight and insurance\r\nunavoidably attached to so long a navigation, an expence which in\r\nthe first of these instances, is augmented in a two-fold degree,\r\nby the entire absence of return cargoes; if it be stated that\r\nthese local disadvantages alone, render it impossible for the\r\nimporters to dispose of their merchandize for less than fifty per\r\ncent. on the prime cost to their immediate purchasers, and that\r\nat least three fourths of the population are obliged from the\r\nwant of ready money, to buy on long credits of these secondary\r\nagents, who fashion their prices according to the nature and\r\nextent of their customers' embarrassments, sometimes contenting\r\nthemselves with a second advance of fifty per cent.; but more\r\nfrequently affixing to their goods a profit of a hundred, a\r\nhundred and fifty, and two hundred per cent.: if it be\r\nrecollected how far these grievous exactions are aggravated by\r\nthe system of vassalage just described, a system which places all\r\nthe unfortunate wretches who are reduced to it at the absolute\r\nmercy of their rapacious landlords; if the profligate and\r\nimprovident habits and disposition of the generality of the\r\ncolonists be taken into the estimate, and their total disregard\r\nof order and economy in their domestic arrangements; but above\r\nall, if their unfortunate propensity to the excessive use of\r\nspirituous liquors be superadded; a propensity which like Aaron's\r\nrod swallows up every other passion, and for the momentary\r\ngratification of which they willingly sacrifice every prospect of\r\npresent enjoyment, and deliberately entail on themselves and\r\ntheir families lasting privation and want; I say if due\r\nconsideration be given to all these circumstances, it will be no\r\ndifficult matter to believe in the sad reality of the general\r\nwretchedness and penury which I have depicted. But it must be\r\nfurther evident that this equal division of the colonial revenue\r\nhas been assumed merely by way of exemplification, and that it is\r\na fiction, the realization of which is beyond the extreme verge\r\nof possibility: a fiction which never has been and never can be\r\nverified. In this colony as in every other community, there is a\r\nregular gradation of property, and perhaps there is no country on\r\nthe face of the earth, except Russia, where it is so partially\r\ndistributed. If then I have reconciled the probability of the\r\nwretched condition of the colonists, with the assumption of an\r\nequality of wealth, when there is, in fact, the greatest\r\ninequality, it must be evident that the picture which I have\r\ndrawn, pregnant and glowing as it is with distress, is far from\r\nsurcharged, and still requires both colouring and expression to\r\nconvey a perfect representation of the scene.\r\n\r\nOf the whole colonial income about £100,000 annually may\r\nbe considered as arising from the labours of the agricultural\r\nbody. This is undoubtedly that portion of the colonial wealth\r\nwhich gets into most general circulation; but even _it_ is\r\nfar from undergoing that minute subdivision and universal\r\ndiffusion which are requisite for the maintenance of a constant\r\ninternal circulating medium. Created in the first instance by the\r\ngovernment in payment of the grain, meat, etc. furnished by the\r\nsettlers, it is immediately handed over by them to the traders to\r\nwhom they may be indebted, and from these again passes to the\r\nimporting merchants, on whom they may be dependent for their\r\nsupplies of merchandize, who in their turn eventually transmit it\r\nto their foreign correspondents. It may consequently be perceived\r\nthat the purchases and sales which must be incessantly occurring,\r\nbesides those to which this part of the colonial income is thus\r\ndevoted, such as the sales of provisions in the markets, the\r\npayment of wages, and, in fine, the infinite transactions to\r\nwhich the wants or the whims of society are eternally giving\r\nbirth, and to which a common medium of determinate value is\r\nessential are but little, if indeed at all facilitated by a sum\r\nof money, which after passing through a few hands, disappears\r\nfrom the colony for ever. To prevent, therefore, the interchanges\r\nand activity of the community from being brought to a stand, it\r\nbecame necessary to create some other circulating medium; and as\r\nthe government took no part in this highly important affair, the\r\nwhole burden of the arrangement fell upon the inhabitants. The\r\narrangement itself was, in consequence, such as might have been\r\nexpected from their circumstances and situation: the whole of\r\nthem who had any real, or apparent pretensions to responsibility,\r\nbecame with one accord bankers; issuing small promissory notes to\r\nprovide for their minuter occasions, merely on the strength of\r\ntheir credit, and frequently in anticipation of their means. This\r\n\"Colonial currency,\" as it was termed, soon experienced that\r\ndepreciation in the market, compared with the government, or\r\nsterling money, which it was natural to expect from the doubtful\r\ncircumstances of many of its issuers. In a short time government\r\nmoney could not be had for it under a discount of fifty per\r\ncent.; still the drawers of these promissory notes were compelled\r\nby the decisions of the court of civil jurisdiction to pay them\r\nat par, whenever they were presented; so that all the persons of\r\nreal responsibility, who had been induced in the first instance\r\nfrom necessity to adopt this system, withdrew their bills from\r\nthe market, and naturally preferred purchasing with government\r\nmoney the notes of others at this depreciated rate, to the\r\nissuing at the same rate notes of their own, which they would be\r\neventually obliged to take up at par. The consequence was that\r\nall the subsequent issuers of these notes were needy adventurers,\r\nwho possessing little or no property adopted this method of\r\nsupplying their extravagance, or entering into desperate\r\nspeculations that could hardly succeed, in violation of every\r\nprinciple of honesty, and at the expence of the industrious and\r\nresponsible part of the community. This subsequent currency,\r\ntherefore, encountered a still further depreciation; and when\r\ngovernment money could be at all obtained for it, it was only at\r\na discount of 100, 150, and even 200 per cent. Such, however, has\r\nbeen the necessity for a circulating medium of some sort or\r\nother, that the public, as if by a general implied consent,\r\nwithout any expressed convention, have permitted the existence\r\nand increase of this worthless substitute, and have thus affixed\r\na kind of nominal value to that which is in reality worth\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nTo any one, who has not fully considered the difficulty\r\nattending the exchange of one commodity for another, and the\r\nimpossibility of apportioning at all times, what one man may have\r\nto dispose of to the exact value of what another man may have to\r\noffer in return, an impossibility that would frequently prevent\r\nthe exchange altogether, and thus subject the parties to mutual\r\ninconvenience and distress, the rude system of barter would\r\nappear preferable to so vile a common standard of value as the\r\nexisting currency. Its badness, indeed, has been the means of\r\nintroducing the system of barter as far as it was practicable;\r\nbut as the entire introduction of this system would be hardly\r\ncompatible with the first imperfect elements of society, the\r\ncivilization of the colonists has imposed a limit to it, and\r\nprescribed a necessity for the toleration of the present\r\ncirculating medium, which nothing but the creation of a better\r\ncan supersede. Two attempts were made to remedy this evil, but\r\nthey both in the event proved abortive; the richer class of the\r\ninhabitants on these occasions formed combinations and entered\r\ninto resolutions not to receive in payment the bills of any\r\nindividuals who had not been admitted into their society. To\r\nprevent a recurrence of the loss, which the original responsible\r\nissuers of currency had sustained by its depreciation in the\r\nmarket, they affixed to it themselves a specific depreciation,\r\npromising in the body of their notes to pay them on demand in\r\ngovernment money at a discount, in the first of these instances,\r\nof twenty-five per cent., and in the last of fifty per cent. But\r\nit must be evident that a currency of this nature, payable on\r\ndemand, became of equal value with the sterling money of the\r\ngovernment, to those who took it at the stipulated depreciation;\r\nand it was accordingly no sooner in circulation, than it got into\r\nthe hands of the importing merchants, and was presented to the\r\ndrawers for payment. It was thus too good for its intended\r\npurpose; and the old worthless currency, which had been for a\r\nwhile proscribed, gradually returned into circulation. The\r\npresent governor, sensible of the advantage which the colony\r\nwould derive from its supercession, and from the substitution of\r\nanother of intrinsic value in its stead, caused ten thousand\r\npounds worth of dollars to be sent from India, and had a piece\r\nstruck out of the middle of each, to which he affixed by\r\nproclamation, the value of fifteen pence, and to the remainder\r\nthat of five shillings, making the whole dollar worth six\r\nshillings and three pence. This money he caused to be given in\r\npayment of the various articles of internal produce received into\r\nthe king's stores; but as they were exchanged every month, if\r\npresented to the commissariat department, for bills on the lords\r\nof the treasury, in the same manner as the government receipts\r\nhad been exchanged previously, they have not realized the hopes\r\nof abolishing the currency, with which they were issued. Some few\r\nof them, indeed, have from time to time eluded the grasp of the\r\nmerchants and traders, and got in consequence of the minuteness\r\nof their separate value into temporary circulation; but the use\r\nof the original currency has neither been superseded nor\r\ndiminished.\r\n\r\nThat the colonists should have been thus forced during so long\r\na period, in spite of all their efforts, and contrary to the\r\ndesire of their government, to tolerate a medium of circulation\r\npossessing no intrinsic value whatever, and dependent solely on a\r\ngeneral, constrained, and tacit consent for its support and\r\nduration, is, I should apprehend, one of the most forcible proofs\r\nwhich it is in the nature of things to adduce, in illustration of\r\ntheir present poverty and wretchedness. It is impossible to offer\r\na more satisfactory demonstration of the inferiority of their\r\nmeans to their necessities. Important under every point of view\r\nas is the establishment of a safe currency, such is the\r\nirresistible pressure of their debts, so much is their\r\nexpenditure superior to their revenue, that they can devote no\r\nportion of it to the most urgent purpose of domestic economy: the\r\nwhole is absorbed, and does not suffice to procure those articles\r\nof foreign supply, which are absolutely indispensable to\r\ncivilized life.\r\n\r\nBy the last intelligence from the colony it appears, indeed,\r\nthat a company has undertaken the establishment of a colonial\r\nbank, and obtained a charter for this purpose from the governor;\r\nbut I should imagine they cannot possibly succeed in creating a\r\npermanent medium of circulation. The constant run that their\r\nbills will have on them for payment, in consequence of the\r\nimports of the colony being so much greater than its income, will\r\nsoon occasion them to exchange the whole of their capital for the\r\nmortgage securities on which they at present issue it; and\r\nalthough this circumstance will not perhaps detract from the\r\nprofits of this institution, it will render the toleration of the\r\nexisting currency, if not of undiminished, still of indispensable\r\nnecessity.* The introduction, therefore, of a safe and sufficient\r\nmedium of circulation may be still pronounced a desideratum, and\r\none of the first importance to the general prosperity of the\r\ncolonists. The government in their present distressed situation,\r\nis perhaps the only power competent to the accomplishment of this\r\nbeneficial object, and it is to be hoped that they will no longer\r\ndelay effecting such a great and substantial amelioration.\r\n\r\n[* This is an event which the colonists do not appear\r\nto anticipate. It is the general belief that the colonial\r\ncurrency has been crushed for ever; but I am greatly mistaken if\r\nthat vile medium of circulation will not again revive before the\r\nexpiration of another twelve-month, unless either the capital of\r\nthe bank be greatly increased, or its operations be in future\r\nconfined to the discounting of bills at a short date, to the\r\nutter exclusion of the system of advancing money on mortgage\r\nsecurities.]\r\n\r\nAmidst the numerous deplorable consequences that have been\r\nattendant on this constant state of embarrassment, none perhaps\r\nis more deeply to be lamented than the great check which this\r\ndifficulty of finding a profitable occupation for labour has\r\nproved to the progress of population. Mr. Malthus, who has\r\nimmortalized himself by his essay on this branch of political\r\neconomy, has so satisfactorily shewn that the increase of\r\npopulation is proportioned to the facility of procuring\r\nsubsistence, and administering to the various wants of a family,\r\nthat it is quite unnecessary for me to repeat arguments with\r\nwhich every one ought to be familiar, to prove that this colony\r\nhas not been exempt from the destructive influence of causes\r\nwhose operation has been steady and invariable in all ages and in\r\nall countries. The inference that this difficulty has been a\r\npreventive to marriage, and to the consequent progress of\r\npopulation is self-evident: to be understood it only requires to\r\nbe stated. But the numerical increase of the colony has been\r\nchecked in a still greater degree, perhaps by the constant\r\nreturns from its shores which are daily occasioned by the same\r\ncauses. What inducement, in fact, exists for any person to remain\r\nthere who has the power of quitting it? Who would voluntarily\r\nbecome an inhabitant of a country where he has no rights, no\r\npossessions, that are sacred and inviolable? And where to this\r\ninsecurity of person and property are superadded the greatest\r\nimpediments to the extension of industry? A country of this kind,\r\nit may be easily imagined, possesses no allurements for those who\r\nhave ever breathed a freer atmosphere; and it is not to be\r\nwondered at, that hundreds of convicts on the expiration of their\r\nseveral terms of transportation should be continually leaving a\r\ncountry, where the freeman and the slave are alike subjected to\r\nthe uncontrolled authority of an individual; where the trial by\r\njury is unknown, and an odious military tribunal substituted in\r\nits stead; and where there is no representative body to protect\r\nthem in the enjoyment of their rights, and to secure them either\r\nfrom the imposition of arbitrary and destructive taxes, or from\r\nthe influence of unjust and impolitic laws.\r\n\r\nHow far these two great checks to population which I have just\r\nmentioned, have operated, may be best ascertained from the last\r\ncensus taken in the colony in the month of November 1817. At that\r\ntime it appears that the population of all the settlements,\r\nwhether in New Holland or Van Diemen's Land, amounted only to\r\ntwenty thousand three hundred and seventy-nine souls. It is not\r\nin my power to obtain returns of all the convicts who have been\r\nlanded at various times in this colony; but as it is now about\r\nthirty years since the period of its foundation, very little\r\ndoubt can be entertained that the total of them must have nearly\r\nequalled the amount of the actual population.* The number\r\ntransported thither for some years past cannot be estimated at\r\nless than two thousand annually; yet notwithstanding this vast\r\nyearly numerical accession, notwithstanding the unparalleled\r\nsalubrity of the climate, and the consequent small proportion\r\nwhich the number of deaths bears to the number of births, the\r\npopulation of the colony has been found to advance at a\r\ncomparatively slow pace. It cannot be supposed that it could ever\r\nhave been in the intention of the government, that those persons\r\nwhom the sentence of the law had exiled to these remote shores,\r\nshould thus be incessantly returning to those scenes, which had\r\nwitnessed their former irregularities and condemnation. However\r\nsincere their reformation, it must be evident that with a\r\nblemished character, the difficulty of obtaining employment and\r\nprocuring an honest livelihood, would be almost insuperable. It\r\nhas been accordingly found that these unfortunate persons have\r\ngenerally renewed their ancient habits, and ended their career\r\neither by falling sacrifices on the scaffold to the often\r\nviolated laws of their country, or by imposing on the government\r\na necessity for the second, and in many instances for the third\r\ntime of re-transporting them to this colony, where, if sufficient\r\nencouragement and protection had been afforded them in the first\r\ninstance, they would have gladly remained, and have continued\r\ngood and useful members of society.\r\n\r\n[* This conjecture has been verified by a publication\r\nwhich has lately appeared from the pen of the Honourable Henry\r\nGrey Bennet, M. P. intituled, \"A Letter to Lord Viscount Sidmouth\r\non the Transportation Laws; the State of the Hulks, and of the\r\nColonies in New South Wales.\" From this it appears that from May,\r\n1787, to January, 1817, the number of convicts transported\r\nthither amounted to seventeen thousand; so that the entire\r\nincrease which has taken place in the population in the course of\r\nthirty years, both from emigration and births, cannot be\r\nestimated at more than four thousand souls, so numerous have been\r\nthe returns of convicts after the expiration of their\r\nsentences.]\r\n\r\nIt is here but candid to confess, that one of the leading\r\ncauses why so many of this class are continually quitting the\r\ncolony, has been their desire to rejoin their wives and families.\r\nThis motive, however, no longer exists; since in a dispatch from\r\nthe noble secretary of state for the colonial department, to\r\nGovernor Macquarie, of which the receipt has been for some time\r\npast acknowledged, it was directed that \"returns should be\r\noccasionally sent home of such convicts as may have applied for\r\npermission for their wives to join them; and that it should be\r\ntherein stated whether such persons have the means of maintaining\r\ntheir wives and families, in the event of their being allowed to\r\nproceed to the colony.\" Measures have been already taken to carry\r\nthe humane intention here manifested by his majesty's government\r\ninto effect; and many hundreds who would otherwise have quitted\r\nthe colony, will now remain there, and thus both the permanency\r\nof their reformation will be guaranteed, and the march of\r\ncolonization greatly accelerated. Generous Britain, not more\r\nrenowned in arts and arms, than in mercy and benevolence; may thy\r\nsupremacy be coeval with thy humanity! Or if that be impossible;\r\nif thou be doomed to undergo that declension and decay, from\r\nwhich no human institutions, no works of man appear to be exempt,\r\nmay the records of thy philanthropy hold the world in subject awe\r\nand admiration, long after the dominion of thy power shall have\r\npassed away! May they soften the hearts of future nations, and be\r\na shining sun that shall illuminate both hemispheres, and chase\r\nfrom every region of the earth the black reign of barbarism and\r\ncruelty for ever!\r\n\r\nWhile the existing system of government is thus rapidly\r\nundermining the general prosperity and freedom, and presenting\r\nthe greatest checks to the progress of colonization, it is but\r\nnatural to conclude from the pertinacity with which it is\r\nmaintained, that it is at least productive of some beneficial\r\nresults to the power to which it owes its origin and existence.\r\nIt were a species of political anomaly to suppose that any order\r\nof things diametrically opposite to the interests of the\r\ngoverned, should be persisted in, unless it were attended with\r\nsome positive advantage to the governors. Ridiculous, however, as\r\nin every case perhaps but the present such a supposition would\r\nbe, it is verified in the instance of this colony; since the\r\nsystem pursued there, is not only destructive of the vital\r\ninterests of the inhabitants at large, but at the same time,\r\nburdensome to this country, and contraventory of the very\r\nintentions with which this settlement was established. This\r\nassertion I shall shortly prove, and then leave it to more\r\nsagacious politicians than myself, to demonstrate the consistency\r\nof what appears to me the most absurd and incongruous paradox\r\nthat is to be met with in the history of governments. And first\r\nthat the present system is burdensome to this country, and what\r\nis worse, must become every year still more so, is evident from\r\nthe gradually progressive augmentation which has taken place in\r\nthe expenditure of this colony. From 1788 to 1797, the total\r\nexpence was £1,037,230, or £86,435 per annum; from\r\n1798 to 1811, it amounted to £1,634,926, or £116,709\r\nper annum; and from 1812 to 1815, both inclusive, to\r\n£793,827, or £198,456 per annum. In 1816, the expence\r\nwas £193,775 10s. 8¾d. and in 1817 it\r\nwas £229,152 6s. 3¼d. being nearly\r\ntreble the annual amount in the year 1797. This estimate, indeed,\r\nincludes the cost of transportation; and the rapid increase that\r\nhas taken place of late years in the sum total, has been in a\r\nconsiderable degree occasioned by the great increase in the\r\nnumber of criminals sent out to the colony; but still that there\r\nhas been a regularly progressive augmentation to the internal\r\nexpenditure is quite incontrovertible.\r\n\r\nIt requires no great portion of discernment to foretel that\r\nwhile the present prohibitory system remains in force; while the\r\ncolony is alike prevented from profiting by its natural\r\nproductions, and from calling into life the artificial ones of\r\nwhich it is capable, that it must continue an increasing burthen\r\nand expence to the power on which it is dependent for support,\r\nand which thus unwisely restrains its exertions. If the\r\nconsideration of the benefits which this country might eventually\r\nderive from encouraging the growth and exportation of such\r\nproducts as this colony might furnish; if the prospect of finding\r\nat no very remote period in a part of our own dominions, various\r\nraw materials essential to the fabrication of some of our staple\r\nmanufactures, and for which we are at present wholly dependent on\r\nforeigners; if, in fine, the certainty of extending, instead of\r\ndestroying, a market for the consumption of those manufactures\r\nthemselves, be not motives of sufficient weight and cogency to\r\ndraw the attention of his majesty's ministers to the impolitic\r\nand destructive order of things, which prevents the\r\naccomplishment of these desirable ends; it is at least to be\r\nhoped in these times of universal embarrassment, when the cry of\r\ndistress is resounding from one end of the kingdom to the other,\r\nthat the desire of effecting a retrenchment in this part of the\r\npublic expenditure, which has swelled to so enormous an amount,\r\nsolely from ignorance and mismanagement, will at length excite\r\ninquiry, and give rise to a system that will unfetter the\r\ncolonists, and by gradually enabling them to support themselves,\r\nno longer render them an unproductive and increasing burden to\r\nthis country. It is useless, and indeed absurd, for the\r\ngovernment to be sending out incessant injunctions for economy,\r\nand to be eternally insisting upon the necessity of effecting\r\nretrenchments, which their own impolitic restrictions render\r\nimpossible. The addition which is annually made to the population\r\nof the colony must occasion a corresponding expenditure on the\r\npart of the colonial government. The convicts, who are\r\ntransported thither, were maintained at a great expence while in\r\nthis country, and cannot be supported without cost there. So long\r\nas the avenues to industry and enterprize are closed, it is\r\nridiculous to imagine that the colonists can undertake the\r\nmaintenance of a body of men, for whose labour they can find no\r\nprofitable occupation. The expence, therefore, of supporting the\r\ngreat mass of convicts who are constantly arriving in this\r\ncolony, must necessarily increase in spite of all the\r\nexhortations of the government, and all the efforts of the\r\ngovernor, whoever he may be, to carry them into effect. The\r\npresent governor, indeed, has contrived in some measure to comply\r\nwith these recommendations of retrenchment with which he has been\r\nharrassed; but his obedience has been attended with the adoption\r\nof a most pernicious and indefensible system, that of granting\r\ntoo promiscuously tickets of leave to convicts, before sufficient\r\ntime had elapsed for ascertaining the reality of their\r\nreformation, and their title to so important an indulgence. This\r\nprivilege, which exempts them from the public works, and enables\r\nthem to seek employment in every direction throughout the colony,\r\nit may be perceived, turns loose a set of men, who had been\r\nsolemnly pronounced to be improper and dangerous members of\r\nsociety; and affords them an unrestrained opportunity of preying\r\nupon the industrious and deserving, and of committing fresh\r\nenormities, before they have made the atonement affixed to their\r\noriginal offences, and required not more to uphold the\r\ndistinction which ought always to be drawn between virtue and\r\nvice, than from a due regard to their future welfare and\r\nregeneration. It is principally to the introduction of the ticket\r\nof leave system that the considerable reductions which have been\r\neffected of late years in the expences of the colony are to be\r\nascribed. How far this most pernicious and immoral system has\r\nbeen carried, may be seen by reference to the colonial\r\nexpenditure for the four years anterior to 1816. In 1812 it\r\namounted to £176,781; in 1813 to £235,597; in 1814 to\r\n£231,362; and in 1815 it had fallen to £150,087. In\r\nthe two following years, indeed, it has been seen that there has\r\nbeen a considerable increase of expenditure; but still such has\r\nbeen the extension of the ticket of leave system that\r\nnotwithstanding four thousand six hundred and fifty-nine convicts\r\nwere transported between January, 1812, and January, 1817, the\r\nexpences of the colony for this latter year were £6445 less\r\nthan for the year 1813; those of 1817 only amounting to\r\n£229,152, while those of the year 1813 were £235,597.\r\nThis violent and unjustifiable mode of retrenchment, however, has\r\nnot been put into such extensive practice with impunity: it has\r\nbeen attended with its natural and inevitable results, a\r\nproportionate increase of demoralization and crime. The proof of\r\nthis assertion I shall rest on the following government\r\norder:--\r\n\r\n\"Sydney, 30th August, 1817. In consequence of the\r\nfrequent robberies which have been of late committed between\r\nSydney and Paramatta; his Excellency the Governor deems it\r\nexpedient earnestly to recommend to persons in general to travel\r\nonly during the day time, and particularly to those who have the\r\ncharge of loaded carts, to set out from Sydney and Paramatta\r\nrespectively so early after sun-rise as to be enabled to reach\r\nthe place of their destination before sun-set. And with a view to\r\nafford all possible protection to travellers, his Excellency\r\ndirects the principal superintendant of police at Sydney from and\r\nafter Wednesday the 3d of September next, to order two constables\r\nfrom thence to patrole the road every night between Sydney and\r\nPowell's Half-way House; and in like manner the principal\r\nmagistrate at Paramatta to order two constables from that place\r\nto patrole the road every night between Paramatta and Powell's\r\nHalf-way House. The duty of such constables to commence at\r\nsun-set and cease at sun-rise, until further orders. \"The\r\nmagistrates are _particularly enjoined not to grant passes to\r\nconvicts either having tickets of leave or otherwise, excepting\r\non actual duty, or in cases of real emergency where the object is\r\nsatisfactorily explained to the magistrate_.\"\r\n\r\nThis injunction to the magistrates not to grant the ticket of\r\nleave-men passes except under particular circumstances would afford\r\nthe public very little additional security against their depredations;\r\nsince their total exemption from public or individual employment,\r\nplaces them out of all restraint except such as may arise from\r\nthe surveillance of the police, which even in Sydney is badly\r\norganized, because not sufficiently numerous, and to which in the\r\ninterior towns and districts it would be a farce to apply the\r\nname of \"Police\" at all.\r\n\r\nI am aware that the governor has been induced to this measure\r\nin compliance with positive instructions, rather than in\r\nconformity with his own judgment. But a system in such direct\r\nviolation of every principle of justice, morality, and\r\nexpediency, can never be long tolerated. Its continuance, in\r\nfact, would soon annihilate all industry, and convert the colony\r\ninto a den of thieves and murderers, unfit for the abode of\r\nvirtue and honesty, and dangerous to the government itself which\r\nhad authorized it.--It is an extreme which cannot endure, and\r\nwhich is of so violent a nature that it will beget a remedy for\r\nitself, and compel the government to recal into its employment,\r\nand reduce under salutary restraint, a set of persons, who ought\r\nnever to have been freed from it till the expiration of their\r\nsentences, or, at most, till they had given the clearest proof of\r\na sincere reformation. This system, therefore, of granting\r\ntickets of leave to convicts shortly after their arrival, though\r\nundoubtedly attended with a considerable saving to the\r\ngovernment, is of too immoral and dangerous a tendency to be\r\ncarried to any considerable extent; so that the expences of the\r\ncolony great, unnecessarily great as they are, must infallibly\r\nincrease with the progress of transportation, so long as the\r\ngrievous disabilities and impolitic restrictions under which the\r\ncolonists are groaning, remain unrepealed.\r\n\r\nHaving thus shewn that this colony has hitherto been an\r\nincreasing burthen to this country, and that it must necessarily\r\ncontinue so under its present unwise constitution, I proceed in\r\nthe next place to prove that its existing system of government is\r\nalso contraventory of the philanthropic intentions which gave\r\nrise to its foundation. The principal object which the government\r\nof this country had in view was undoubtedly the reformation of\r\nthe thousands exiled to these distant shores. The punishment\r\nwhich it thus inflicted, in banishing them from their native\r\ncountry, and separating them from their friends and connexions,\r\nwas not the end itself, but the means which it employed to effect\r\nthis humane and laudable purpose. Has then the colony in any one\r\npoint of view realized this comprehensive and philanthropic\r\nscheme of morality and regeneration? It has, indeed, proved a\r\nreceptacle for those whose crimes rendered them unfit for the\r\ncommunity which rejected them from its bosom, and in so far has\r\nbeen of some utility to the public; but have the restraints to\r\nwhich they have been subjected; has the system, in fact, by which\r\nthey have been governed during their exile, generally revived\r\nthat morality and virtue, the absence of which propelled them in\r\nthe first instance to the commission of crime, and will always\r\ncontinue them in the same career of vice and punishment? Have\r\nthose, who have expiated their original offence, by undergoing\r\nthe penalty which the law annexed to it, experienced a\r\nreformation in their principles and conduct? And are they\r\ngenerally qualified either to return to the country that banished\r\nthem, or to become good and useful citizens in the one by which\r\nthey have been adopted; and which, since it has constantly\r\nwitnessed their deportment, can best appreciate the reality and\r\nextent of their merits? The records of the several courts of\r\ncriminal judicature are the surest criterion by which to judge of\r\nthis important particular, and will be found decidedly\r\nconfirmatory of the alarming augmentation of immorality and\r\ncrime, which distinguishes every succeeding year, and that too in\r\na proportion far exceeding what would be naturally consequent on\r\nthe increase in the population.\r\n\r\nOn reference to the Sydney Gazattes for the year 1817, I find\r\nthat there were in all ninety-two persons tried by the criminal\r\ncourt. The offences with which they were charged were as follow:\r\n1st, For murder eleven; four of whom were convicted and executed:\r\ntwo were adjudged only guilty of manslaughter; and five were\r\nacquitted. 2dly, For burglaries, eight, five of whom were\r\ncapitally convicted, but their sentences afterwards commuted into\r\ntransportation to the Coal River for life; five were transported\r\nthither for fourteen years, one for seven years, and one was\r\nacquitted. 3dly, For highway robbery, one, who was transported to\r\nNewcastle for fourteen years. 4thly, One incendiary, transported\r\nfor life. 5thly, One for cutting and maiming, acquitted. 6thly,\r\nNine for cattle stealing; of whom two were capitally convicted,\r\ntheir sentence afterwards commuted into transportation for life;\r\nfive were originally sentenced to the same punishment, one\r\ntransported for fourteen years, and one was acquitted. 6thly,\r\nThree for sheep stealing; all capitally convicted, but their\r\nsentences commuted into transportation for life. 7thly, Two for\r\nhorse stealing; one of whom was capitally convicted but not\r\nexecuted, the other sentenced to solitary confinement. 8thly, One\r\nfor rape, but acquitted. 9thly, Twenty-seven for privately\r\nstealing in dwelling and out-houses; two of whom were transported\r\nfor fourteen years, nine for seven years, one for four years,\r\nfour for three years, two for two years, one sentenced to\r\nsolitary confinement, and six acquitted. 10thly, Two for forgery,\r\nfound guilty, but sentence deferred. 11thly, Two for receiving\r\nstolen goods, one of whom was sentenced to the pillory and to\r\nfour years transportation, and the other to transportation alone\r\nfor the same period. 12thly, Five for pig stealing; of whom two\r\nwere transported to Newcastle for fourteen years, one was flogged\r\nand put in the pillory, one transported to Newcastle for two\r\nyears, and one acquitted. Lastly, Nineteen for petty larceny; of\r\nwhom one was sent to Newcastle for four years, one for three\r\nyears, fourteen were sentenced to various terms of solitary\r\nconfinement, and three acquitted.\r\n\r\nFrom this statement, therefore, it appears that during the\r\nyear 1817, out of the ninety-two persons who were tried for\r\nvarious offences, which it will be seen were for the most part of\r\na heinous nature, no fewer than seventy-three were convicted,\r\nfifteen capitally, four of whom were executed, the remaining\r\neleven had their sentences commuted into transportation to the\r\nCoal River for life; that there were six others originally\r\nsentenced to the same punishment; that there were five\r\ntransported for fourteen years, ten for seven years, and that the\r\nremaining thirty-seven were either transported for terms under\r\nseven years, or were punished by solitary confinement. Appalling,\r\nhowever, as this catalogue of crime must be acknowledged, when\r\ncompared with _that_ which could be produced in any other\r\ncommunity of similar extent, it would still appear on the first\r\nview to argue well in favour of the reformatory influence of this\r\ncolony: since Governor Bligh in his examination before the\r\ncommittee of the House of Commons, in the year 1812, presented a\r\ndocument purporting to be a list of criminals tried between\r\nAugust, 1806, and August, 1807, from which it appears that one\r\nhundred and seventeen* persons were arraigned before the criminal\r\ncourt during this interval. If we were therefore to abide by the\r\nrecords of the criminal court alone, we should draw the most\r\nsatisfactory conclusions with respect to the progress of\r\nreformation in the morals and habits of the people since that\r\nperiod. The comparison, indeed, between the catalogue of crime in\r\nthe years 1806 and 1817, would be most gratifying; as\r\nnotwithstanding that the population of the colony rather more\r\nthan doubled itself since the former year, the latter presents a\r\ndecrease in the number of criminals of twenty-five, or in other\r\nwords, crimes would appear to have diminished in the ratio of\r\nabout 9/4 to 1. If the records, therefore, of the criminal court\r\nwere decisive on the subject, it would be impossible not to\r\nconfess that the system pursued in this colony has fully answered\r\nthe humane intentions for which it was founded. But unhappily\r\nthese records are no standard by which to judge of the\r\nreformatory tendency of the system. During Governor Bligh's\r\nadministration, all offenders except those who were charged with\r\nthe most trifling misdemeanors, were tried by the criminal court.\r\nHe was a second Draco, who considered the smallest offence\r\ndeserving of death: and wo to the wretch whom the criminal court\r\ndoomed to this punishment, for he invariably carried its sentence\r\ninto execution. His successor, however, has acted on more\r\nmerciful principles; and, besides, crimes have so rapidly\r\nmultiplied of late years, that the judge advocate would not have\r\nsufficient time for presiding in the two civil courts of which he\r\nis the head, were he obliged to dispose of all the culprits that\r\nmight be arraigned in the criminal court. But it is well known to\r\nthose who are at all conversant with the state of the colony,\r\nthat but a very small portion of the offences which are committed\r\nthere, are now brought under the jurisdiction of this court. The\r\nmajority of the criminals who are now tried by it are either free\r\npersons, or such as have obtained emancipations; i.e. those whom\r\nthe various governors have made free in the colony, but who are\r\nnot at liberty to quit it. The benches of magistrates, and the\r\nsuperintendent of police, are delicate of deciding on charges in\r\nwhich the members of these two free classes are implicated; but\r\nthey dispose of offenders already under the sentence of the law\r\nin a summary manner, either by transporting them to the Coal\r\nRiver, by putting them in the gaol gangs, by sending them (if\r\nthey happen to be females) to the factory, or by simply ordering\r\nthem corporal punishment, unless they are charged with murder, or\r\nsome capital felony; and even in this latter case they frequently\r\ninflict some summary punishment. With respect to the first of\r\nthese summary modes of punishment, transportation to the Coal\r\nRiver, it has already been stated that the population of this\r\nsettlement amounted in the year 1817, to five hundred and fifty\r\nsouls: of these not more than one hundred, including the civil\r\nand military establishments, and the settlers and their families\r\non the upper banks of the river, were free. The remaining four\r\nhundred and fifty, therefore, were persons who had been convicted\r\nof crimes either by the criminal court or by the magistracy, and\r\nretransported thither for various periods. Those few, it has been\r\nseen, who are condemned to this punishment by the criminal court,\r\nare for the most part sentenced to long terms of transportation;\r\nbut as nine-tenths of the criminals at this settlement are sent\r\nthither either by the benches of magistrates, or by the\r\nsuperintendent of police, who seldom transport for a longer\r\nperiod than two years, and more frequently for one year, or six\r\nmonths, the population may at a very moderate calculation be\r\nconsidered as undergoing a complete change every two years, or in\r\nother words, it may be concluded that two hundred and twenty-five\r\npersons are annually transported thither by way of punishment. We\r\nmust therefore add this number to the culprits convicted before\r\nthe court of criminal judicature, and we shall then have a total\r\nof three hundred and eighteen persons annually convicted of\r\ncrimes in the colony. This is of itself an alarming sum of\r\ncriminality; but we must not stop here, since it only conducts us\r\nto the second of the summary modes of punishment which I have\r\nenumerated; viz. the gaol gangs. There are upon an average about\r\nfifty persons in the gaol gang at Sydney, and about the same\r\nnumber in the gaol gangs belonging to the other towns and\r\ndistricts in the colony. These are criminals convicted of smaller\r\noffences than those who are transported to the Coal River; they\r\nare worked from sunrise to sun-set, and are locked up in the\r\nprisons during the night. This mode of punishment is seldom\r\ninflicted for a longer term than four months. It may therefore be\r\nsafely computed that these gaol gangs are changed once in this\r\nperiod, or in other words, that three hundred persons annually\r\npass through this ordeal. This further addition to the formidable\r\ncatalogue of crimes already made out, increases the total to six\r\nhundred and eighteen persons, yet only leads us to the third mode\r\nof summary punishment, viz. labour at the factory at Paramatta.\r\nThe number of women sentenced to this mode of punishment may be\r\naveraged at one hundred and fifty, and as the average term of\r\ntheir sentences does not exceed six months, we have a farther\r\nnumber of three hundred to add to the above estimate. This\r\nincreases it to nine hundred and eighteen persons; but we have\r\nstill one other mode of punishment in petto, corporal punishment\r\nsimply; and I have no doubt that the numbers on whom it is\r\nannually inflicted will at least swell the grand total of persons\r\nconvicted of various criminal offences during the year 1817,\r\neither by the criminal courts, by the benches of magistrates, by\r\nthe superintendent of police, or by the district magistrates to\r\none thousand. We may now draw some sort of a comparison between\r\nthe amount of crime in the years 1806 and 1817. I should imagine,\r\non the highest calculation, that not more than one hundred\r\npersons in addition to those tried by the criminal court during\r\nthat year, could, from the system then in practice, have been\r\nsummarily dealt with by the magistracy; but allowing even that\r\nthere were two hundred, and that the whole number of persons\r\nstated by Governor Bligh to have been tried by that court were\r\nfound guilty, a most improbable supposition, the year 1806 will\r\nonly then give a total of three hundred and sixteen offenders,\r\ni.e. not one third the amount of those who were convicted in the\r\nyear 1817. Crime therefore has been trebled, while the population\r\nhas only been doubled, or in other words, the increase of the\r\nformer has been to the increase of the latter as three to\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\n[* Page 42 Appendix to the Report of the House of\r\nCommons in 1812.]\r\n\r\nWhat else, indeed, could be expected from a system which is\r\nevery day enlarging the circle of poverty and distress? Is it\r\nwithin the possibility of belief that people should become more\r\nhonest as they become more necessitous? That they should\r\nscrupulously refrain from making inroads on the possessions of\r\ntheir richer neighbours, while they themselves are suffering\r\nunder the influence of progressive penury? Under such\r\ncircumstances it would be the very height of absurdity to expect\r\nan increase of virtue and honesty. Wherever it is not within the\r\ncompass of industry to provide for its wants, a recourse to crime\r\nin order to make up the deficiency is inevitable to a certain\r\nextent even in a moral country. What then must be the result of\r\nthis inability in a felon population, long habituated to theft,\r\nand naturally predisposed to criminality? In such a community as\r\nthis, the government are doubly bound to neglect no measures\r\nwhich may be calculated to repress this vicious propensity. If\r\nthey adopt the contrary line of conduct; if they administer\r\nstimulants to vice instead of anodynes; if they, in fact, create\r\nincitements to dishonesty too potent even for virtuous misery to\r\nwithstand, are not _they_ the authors of a system thus\r\nimpregnated with corruption, virtually the parent of the\r\nmonstrous litter to which it gives birth? And though according to\r\nthe inflexible principles of justice, any violation of the\r\nproperty of another is not to be exculpated, humanity will always\r\npity the distressed delinquent, and wish that she had the power\r\nof substituting the primary author of the crime in the place of\r\nthe condemned criminal. How would the world be reformed, if the\r\nframers of the unjust and impolitic laws, which are every where\r\nthe bane of mankind, and the cause of so much misery and vice,\r\nwere arraigned at the bar of justice, and compelled to answer for\r\nall the depravity that might be traced to the demoralizing\r\ninfluence of their measures?\r\n\r\nThe picture of the colony which I have presented, aggravated\r\nas it is, faithfully delineates the different descending\r\ngradations by which it has sunk to its present abyss of misery,\r\nand is of itself sufficiently demonstrative of the radical defect\r\nthat there is in its polity, and of the necessity for an\r\nalteration in it: nevertheless, it may not be altogether\r\ninexpedient to dive a little into futurity, and to view through\r\nthe mirror of the imagination the further results which the\r\nexperience of the past may convince us that a perseverance in the\r\nsame course of restriction and disability will infallibly lead\r\nto. It requires not the gift of divination to foresee that the\r\nmanufacturing system, which has already taken such deep root, and\r\nso rapidly shot up towards maturity, will still further confirm\r\nand consolidate itself with the increasing poverty of the\r\ncommunity. For several years the importation of British\r\nmanufactures, particularly of cottons, has been comparatively\r\nspeaking on the decline, in consequence of the competition\r\noccasioned by large importations of those articles from India;\r\nwhich though in general of inferior quality, have been more\r\nadapted to the circumstances of the colonists from their inferior\r\nprice. The consumption of hats and woollen cloths has also been\r\ndiminished, but not to the same considerable extent by the\r\ncolonial manufactures of the same denomination, which are\r\nlikewise much inferior to the British, but have the two-fold\r\nadvantage of being cheaper, and to be obtained for wool, grain,\r\nmeat, etc. without the intervention of money, which it is\r\ngenerally out of the power of the consumers to furnish.\r\n\r\nThis system of barter, which has materially favoured their\r\ngrowth, and must necessarily still further encourage and extend\r\nit, is not, as might at first be imagined, prejudicial to the\r\nmanufacturer; since the wool which he thus receives in exchange\r\nfor his commodity is the raw material required for its\r\nreproduction, and therefore saves him the trouble of seeking it\r\nin other quarters; and the meat, grain, etc. are distributed\r\namong his workmen at the market prices of the day, and free him\r\nfrom the necessity of paying the full value of their labour in\r\nmoney, which under existing circumstances would most probably be\r\nimpracticable. The system itself, therefore, seems to have been\r\nengendered by events, and to be peculiarly adapted to the present\r\nstate of poverty and wretchedness, to which the great mass of the\r\ncolonists are reduced. And although in other countries, and even\r\nin this, if its agricultural powers were unfettered, the workmen\r\nemployed in the fabrication of these manufactures would not\r\nperhaps consent to receive this mixed compensation for their\r\nlabour, yet amidst the actual difficulties of procuring a\r\nsubsistence, and possessed as they are of trades, for which till\r\nlately there was no demand whatever, and for which at the present\r\nmoment there is far from an active competition, they are not only\r\nglad to accept this mode of payment, but would even submit to\r\nmuch harder conditions. We may therefore perceive, that if the\r\nmanufacturer can sell for ready money as much of this commodity\r\nas is requisite to the payment of the residue of their wages, and\r\nat the same time equivalent to the profit which he may derive\r\nfrom his concern, it is all that he need absolutely require. This\r\nmanufacturing system being thus not only suited to the increasing\r\npoverty of the community at large, but also favourable to the\r\ninterests of all the parties concerned in it, whether the\r\nproprietors or the workmen, cannot but gain ground. A few years,\r\nin fact, will completely put it out of the power of at least\r\nseven-eighths of the population to have recourse to the\r\nmanufactures of this country: the expences of the colony will,\r\nindeed, as I have satisfactorily proved, continue to increase,\r\nbut still only in proportion to the augmentation in the body of\r\nconvicts and others, maintained at the charge of the government;\r\nwhile, on the contrary, the population of the colony, in spite of\r\nall the checks imposed on it, will be extending itself more\r\nrapidly within, than by transportation and emigration from\r\nwithout. Its revenue, therefore, will be every year to be divided\r\namong a number of competitors increasing much more rapidly than\r\nitself. Thus their ability to purchase the more perfect and\r\nexpensive commodities of this country, will become daily more\r\ncircumscribed, till at length the use of them will be entirely\r\nsuperseded, or at best confined to the higher orders of society;\r\nwho, it is probable, may be induced in the long run both by the\r\ngrowing perfection of their native manufactures, and by\r\npatriotism, to abjure the consumption of all goods that may have\r\na tendency to augment the prosperity of their common oppressor.\r\nThe colonists, in fact, have only to advance a few steps further\r\nin the manufacturing system to be completely independent of\r\nforeign supply. Already fabricating to a considerable extent\r\ntheir own cloth, the first perhaps of manufactures in utility and\r\nimportance; already furnishing in a great measure their own hats,\r\nleather, soap, candles, and earthenware, they have only to\r\nprovide their own linen, and to erect iron founderies, to become\r\npossessed of all that can be termed strictly necessary to their\r\nsubsistence and even comfort. And these two objects will\r\ndoubtless be soon effected by the active agency of the same\r\npowerful necessity, which has so rapidly given rise to the\r\nvarious manufactures already mentioned. It is, indeed, rather a\r\nmatter of surprise than otherwise, that attempts have not been\r\nalready made to establish manufactories of these two highly\r\nimportant articles; since the colony, on the one hand, is\r\npeculiarly adapted to the growth of flax, and on the other\r\nabounds, as it has been seen, with iron ore of the richest\r\nquality.\r\n\r\nTo what feelings, then, to what conduct, it may be asked, will\r\nthis independence in the resources of the colonists, the bitter\r\nfruit of so much privation and misery, give birth? Will this, the\r\npainful result of so many years' injustice and oppression, tend\r\nto strengthen the bond of union between the colony and this\r\ncountry? Or will it not be the crisis that will sever it for\r\never? England, placed as she is at present on the pinnacle of\r\nglory, and reposing in security on the basis of that commercial\r\nand maritime greatness, from which the gigantic efforts of united\r\nEurope have not been able to remove her, may laugh to scorn the\r\npresumption of any colony, however powerful, that might attempt\r\nto shake off her authority. Like Jupiter on Olympus, she has only\r\nto stretch out her hand and overthrow the united force of all her\r\ncolonies with the chain to which she has bound their destinies.\r\nNo one can doubt, that such an attempt would be preposterous at\r\nthe present moment, nor would the most strenuous advocate for\r\ncolonial independence, the most violent enemy to the supremacy of\r\nthis country, dream of its immediate execution. Still let her not\r\nlull herself into a false security; let her not measure the\r\nforbearance of the colony by its own impotency and\r\ninsignificance. Despair always begets resources, and inspires an\r\nunnatural vigor. The enmity of the most feeble becomes\r\nformidable, when it has justice ranged under its banners, and\r\nought not to be excited without necessity. Besides, is it worthy\r\nthe character of a nation, who has evinced herself the determined\r\nenemy of tyrants, and the avenger of the freedom of the world, to\r\nbecome the oppressor of her own subjects, and that too for the\r\nmere sake of oppression, in subversion alike of their interests\r\nand of her own? Has she not, and will she not always have\r\n_external enemies enow_ to contend with, without thus\r\ncreating, _unnecessarily_ creating, _domestic ones?_\r\nLet her from the midst of the glory with which she is environed\r\ncompare her situation, brilliant and imposing as it is, with what\r\nit might have been: let her look at the consequences of her\r\nformer injustice. Is not the most formidable on the list of her\r\nenemies, a nation, which might have this day been the most\r\nattached and faithful of her friends? A nation which, instead of\r\nwatching every occasion to circumscribe her power, would, if its\r\nrights had been respected, have been still embodied with her\r\nempire and confirmatory of her strength? Will this terrible\r\nlesson have no influence on the regulation of her future conduct?\r\nWill not this dear bought experience teach her wisdom? Or has she\r\nyet to learn that the reign of injustice and tyranny involves in\r\nits very constitution the germ of its duration and punishment?\r\nLet her ask herself, \"what would have been the consequence if,\r\nduring the late war with America, the ports of this colony had\r\nbeen open to the vessels of that nation?\" How many hundreds of\r\nthe valuable captures, which the Americans made in the Indian\r\nseas and on the coast of Peru, might have safely awaited there\r\nthe termination of the war, which were recaptured by her cruisers\r\nin view of the ports of their country? How many hundreds of their\r\nown vessels, that shared the same fate, would have still belonged\r\nto their merchants? And is there no probability, that a\r\nperseverance in the present system of injustice and oppression,\r\nmay on some future occasion, urge the colonists to shake off this\r\nintolerable yoke, and throw themselves into the arms of so\r\npowerful a protector? May they not by these means acquire\r\nindependence long before the epoch when they would have obtained\r\nit by their own force and maturity? Or at least may they not\r\nplace themselves under the government of more just and\r\nconsiderate rulers? How would this country repent her folly, if\r\nshe should thus become the instrument of her own abasement; if\r\nshe should herself be the cause of establishing a power already\r\nthe most formidable rival of her commercial and maritime\r\nascendency, in the very heart of her most valuable possessions,\r\nat the main external source of her wealth and prosperity?\r\n\r\nTo those who are acquainted with the local situation of this\r\ncolony; who have traversed the formidable chain of mountains by\r\nwhich it is bounded from north to south; who have viewed the\r\nimpregnable natural positions, that the only connecting ridge by\r\nwhich a passage into the interior can be effected, every where\r\npresents; to those who are aware that this ridge is in many\r\nplaces not more than thirty feet in width, and have beheld the\r\nterrific chasms by which it is bounded, chasms inaccessible to\r\nthe most agile animal of the forest, and that will for ever defy\r\nthe approach of man; to those, I say, who are acquainted with all\r\nthese circumstances, the independence of this colony, should it\r\nbe goaded into rebellion, appears neither so problematical nor\r\nremote, as might be otherwise imagined. Of what avail would whole\r\narmies prove in these terrible defiles, which only five or six\r\nmen could approach abreast? What would be the effect of artillery\r\non advancing columns crowded into so narrow a compass? A few\r\nminutes exposure to such a dreadful carnage, would annihilate the\r\nassailing army; or at best only preserve its scattered remnants\r\nfrom destruction by raising an intervening barrier of the\r\ncarcases of its slaughtered martyrs. If the colonists should\r\nprudently abandon the defence of the sea-coast, and remove with\r\ntheir flocks and herds into the fertile country behind these\r\nimpregnable passes, what would the force of England, gigantic as\r\nit is, profit her? She might, indeed, if they were unassisted in\r\ntheir efforts by any foreign power, cut off their communication\r\nfor awhile with the coast; but her armies entirely dependent on\r\nexternal supply, and at so great a distance from the centre of\r\ntheir resources, would gradually moulder away, as well by the\r\nincessant operation of a partisan warfare, as by defection to\r\ntheir adversaries, whom her troops would be led to combat only\r\nwith regret. They would not enter into a war of this description\r\nwith the same animosity and desire of vengeance that might\r\nactuate their leaders. They would behold in their opponents,\r\nBritons, or the descendants of Britons, placed in hostile array\r\nagainst them unwillingly, and not from any ancient and inveterate\r\nspirit of hatred and rivality, but from constrained resistance to\r\ntyranny, and in vindication of their most sacred and indubitable\r\nrights. Nor would they in the midst of their disgust for so\r\nunjust and unnatural a contest, behold the beauty and fertility\r\nof the country without drawing a comparison between their\r\ncondition, and what it would be, were they to quit the ranks of\r\noppression, and become the champions of that independence, which\r\nthey were destined to repress. Such will be the consequences of\r\nthe impolitic and oppressive system of government pursued in this\r\ncolony; such the probable results of the contest to which it must\r\neventually give rise. If I have been unqualified in expressing my\r\nreprobation of such unwise and unjust measures; if I have evinced\r\nmyself the fearless assertor of the rights of my compatriots; and\r\nif I have spoke without reserve of the resistance which the\r\nviolation and suppression of those rights will in the end\r\noccasion, I must nevertheless protest against being classed among\r\nthose who are the sworn enemies of all authority, and who place\r\nthe happiness of communities in a freedom from those restraints\r\nwhich the wisdom of ages has established, and demonstrated to be\r\nsalutary and essential. I hope, therefore, that my principles\r\nwill not be mistaken, and that I shall not be exposed to the hue\r\nand cry which have been justly raised against those persons who\r\nare inimical to all existing institutions. There is not a more\r\nsincere friend to established government and legitimacy than he\r\nwho mildly advocates the cause of reform, and points out with\r\ndecency the excrescences that will occasionally rise on the\r\npolitical body, as well from an excess of liberty as of\r\nrestraint: such a person may prevent anarchy; he can never\r\noccasion it.\r\n\r\nThese are the views by which I have been actuated in writing\r\nthis essay. If my hopes should be realized, if I should happily\r\nbe the means of averting the thunder cloud of calamity and\r\ndestruction which is even now gathering on the horizon of my\r\ncountry, and threatens at no very remote period to burst over its\r\nhead, and to scatter death and desolation in its bosom, it is all\r\nthe recompence I seek. If my efforts should unfortunately prove\r\nabortive; if I should fail to rouse the friends of peace and\r\nhumanity to its succour and relief, I shall have experienced a\r\nsufficient mortification, without undergoing the additional one\r\nof being classed with a band of ruffian levellers, who under the\r\nspecious pretext of salutary reform seek, like the jacobin\r\nrevolutionists of France, the subversion of all order, and the\r\nsubstitution in its stead, of a reign of terror, anarchy, and\r\nrapine, amidst the horrors of which they may satiate their\r\navarice, and glut their revenge. Let then the purity of my\r\nmotives be unimpeached, if I should be defeated in the\r\naccomplishment of my object. But why should I despair of success,\r\nwhen I have every support that ought to ensure it? Right, reason,\r\nexpediency, morality, religion, are all on the side of my\r\noppressed country, and must eventually procure the termination of\r\nher sufferings. The disabilities, indeed, under which she has\r\nbeen so long groaning, grounded as they are in no motives of\r\npolicy, but averse to them _all_, ought rather to be\r\nascribed to inadvertence than design. Engaged as this country has\r\nbeen in a tremendous conflict, on the dubious issue of which her\r\nvery existence as a nation was staked, she has had little or no\r\nleisure for attending to the internal economy of her colonies: in\r\nthe midst of her own unparalleled sufferings and sacrifices,\r\ntheirs have been disregarded or forgotten. It is the knowledge of\r\nthis circumstance that has shed a ray of hope and consolation\r\nathwart the gloom which has been thickening year after year\r\naround the colony. It is this consideration that has enabled its\r\ninhabitants to support burdens which would otherwise have been\r\nfound intolerable. Let then their just expectations be at length\r\nfulfilled, and let them not continue the only portion of the\r\nking's subjects, who have no personal reason to rejoice at the\r\nhappy termination of this long and arduous contest. Their\r\nmoderation and forbearance under their grievances, have given\r\nthem an additional claim to redress, scarcely less forcible than\r\nthe existence of the grievances themselves. Yet already years\r\nhave elapsed, since the consolidation of general peace and\r\ntranquillity, and no attention has been paid to their situation\r\nand remonstrances. Already, therefore, the spirit of discontent\r\nso long repressed by hope, but reviving with the progress of this\r\nunnecessary, this unaccountable delay, has begun to manifest\r\nitself, and will soon assume a determinate shape and form. Let\r\nthe government repress this feeling of hostility, while they have\r\nyet the power: a few years further inattention will render it\r\nhereditary and rivet it for ever. It is in the tendency of\r\ncolonies to overstep even legitimate restraint; they will never\r\nlong wear the fetters of injustice and oppression. I am aware\r\nthat it is not one of the least difficult proofs of legislative\r\nwisdom to frame regulations adapted to each progressive stage of\r\ncolonization, and that this difficulty increases with the\r\nmaturity which the colony in question may have attained; but\r\nalthough the treatment of colonies upon their arrival at that\r\ndegree of ascendency, when the enforcement of ancient\r\nrestrictions, founded on the interests, or supposed interests of\r\nthe parent country, but contraventory of the prosperity of the\r\ncolonies themselves, becomes dangerous or impracticable, is, it\r\nmust be allowed, a point of extreme delicacy and tenderness;\r\nthere can at no time be any doubt entertained of the propriety of\r\nabandoning a system founded upon error and injustice, and\r\nproductive of detriment, as well to those who have imposed it, as\r\nto those who are suffering under its baneful operation. It is\r\ntherefore to be hoped that so unwise and unjust a system will no\r\nlonger be continued; that his majesty's government will at length\r\nallow the colonists to use freely the natural productions of\r\ntheir country, and to increase to the utmost its artificial ones;\r\nthat they will, permit them to call their own energies, their own\r\nresources, into life and action, and no longer impoverish them by\r\nrendering them the prey of richer colonies, and what is still\r\nmore absurd and vexatious, of foreigners; that they will, in\r\nfine, grant them the free unrestricted enjoyment of those\r\nprivileges which the bounty of the Creator has extended to them,\r\nand which it is not in any human authority to withhold,\r\nconsistently with the eternal, immutable principles of right and\r\nequity.\r\n\r\nThese privileges consist in the removal of certain\r\nagricultural and commercial restraints, which I shall separately\r\nenumerate; and in a free government, under the protecting shade\r\nof which, the colonists may fearlessly exercise and enjoy their\r\npersonal and private rights, without molestation or\r\nhindrance.\r\n\r\nPART III.\r\n\r\nVARIOUS ALTERATIONS SUGGESTED IN THE PRESENT POLICY OF THIS COLONY.\r\n\r\nOf all the steps that could be taken for the relief of the\r\ncolony, none certainly would prove of such immediate efficacy, as\r\nthe creation of distilleries, and the imposition of so high a\r\nduty on the importation of spirits from abroad, as would amount\r\nto a prohibition. The advantages that would be attendant on this\r\nmeasure may, perhaps, be most forcibly illustrated by a short\r\nreview of the actual loss which the colonists have sustained\r\nduring the last fifteen years, from the want of its adoption. The\r\nspirits imported during this period may be safely estimated on an\r\naverage at the annual value of £10,000, amounting in\r\nfifteen years to the sum of £150,000: and if we add to this\r\n£100,000 more, which it may be calculated that the\r\ngovernment have expended in this interval, in the importation of\r\ncorn, flour, rice, etc. from other countries, we have a grand\r\ntotal of £250,000, that would have been saved to the colony\r\nby the erection of distilleries. The application of so large a\r\nsum to the immediate encouragement of agriculture, would have\r\nimparted life and vigor into the whole community, and would have\r\neffectually prevented that increasing poverty, and the black\r\ntrain of evils consequent on it, which I have already depicted.\r\nAnd although from the increased demand for foreign luxuries,\r\nwhich so great an addition to the colonial income would have\r\nnaturally occasioned, but a small part perhaps of this sum would\r\nhave eventually continued in general circulation, still the means\r\nof the colonists would have at least been brought to a level with\r\ntheir wants; and a sterling circulating medium would have\r\nremained sufficient for all the purposes of domestic economy.\r\nUnder such circumstances there can be little doubt that the\r\nactive and enterprizing spirit of our countrymen would have long\r\nsince effected the establishment of an export trade, which would\r\nhave freed the colony from future embarrassment, and the mother\r\ncountry from the enormous expence which she is annually forced to\r\nincur in its support. But the continual and amazing fluctuations\r\nwhich have taken place in the price of corn, have been a\r\ndeath-blow to the success of every effort that has been directed\r\nto this most important object. At least but one out of all the\r\nnumerous attempts that have been made by individuals, (for none\r\nhave been made by the government,) to raise various articles of\r\nexport, has realized the expectations of its sagacious author,\r\nand promises to become eventually of permanent relief and\r\nimportance to the colony. But it will be more in the order of the\r\narrangement which I have marked out for myself, to treat of this\r\nvery important subject hereafter: I recur, therefore, to the\r\nconclusion which I was about to draw from the foregoing premises;\r\nthat to the perfect success of every enterprize of a manual\r\nnature, it is essential that the price of provisions in general,\r\nbut of corn in particular, should be reduced to such a point as\r\nto afford a fair profit to the grower; and at the same time that\r\nit should not be subject to any such extraordinary rise as to\r\nsuperinduce a proportionate increase in the price of labour. To\r\nkeep the value of corn in this just mean, it is necessary that\r\nthe growth of it should be encouraged to a pitch far beyond the\r\nsphere of the ordinary demand; and this is to be effected\r\ngenerally in two ways, by augmenting the internal consumption by\r\nartificial means, as by breweries, distilleries, etc. and by\r\npermitting a free exportation of the surplus. But the colony is\r\nat present unable from the smallness of its resources and its\r\nremoteness from Europe, the great mart for the surplus corn of\r\nother countries, to become a competitor with them in this branch\r\nof commerce: it follows, therefore, that the constant abundance\r\nof corn indispensable to the establishment and maintenance of an\r\nexport trade, can only be guaranteed by the enforcement of all\r\nsuch measures as have a tendency to increase internal\r\nconsumption; and of these I again repeat that the erection of\r\ndistilleries, etc. is the most easy and the most efficacious.\r\n\r\nIndependent of this general reasoning, which is equally\r\napplicable to all countries, the colony can unhappily furnish\r\nparticular grounds of argument in the unfortunate localities of\r\nits agricultural settlements, which render the adoption of this\r\nmeasure of still more imperative necessity. Allured to the banks\r\nof the river Hawkesbury, both by the superiority of the soil, and\r\nthe facilities which the navigation of this river afforded for\r\nthe conveyance of produce to market, a circumstance of material\r\nadvantage even at this moment, but of incalculable importance at\r\na period, when as yet there were few or no cattle for the\r\npurposes of land carriage, the first colonists were encouraged by\r\nGovernor Phillip to establish themselves on this low fertile\r\ntract of country, not so much perhaps from choice as necessity.\r\nHis successors, influenced in part by the same considerations,\r\nfollowed his example in directing the current of colonization\r\ninto the same channel, till in the lapse of about fifteen years\r\nthe whole of the fertile lands on the banks of this river were\r\ncompletely appropriated. Thus unfortunately for the colony, its\r\nprincipal agricultural establishment was formed in a situation\r\nsubject to the inundations of a river, whose waters frequently\r\nrise seventy or eighty feet above its ordinary level.\r\n\r\nThe present governor, to his lasting honour be it mentioned,\r\nhas done all that prudence could effect with the limited means\r\nconfided to him, for the prevention of the calamities invariably\r\nconsequent on these destructive inundations. He has placed the\r\ngreat mass of the colonists, who have been settled during his\r\nadministration, in districts that are not subject to flood; thus\r\nsecuring to themselves and the community at large the fruits of\r\ntheir industry. He has also established townships on the high\r\ngrounds, which generally at the distance of a mile or two from\r\nthe river border its low fertile banks, and has held out various\r\nencouragements, in order to induce the settlers to remove their\r\nhouses and stacks to them. The richer class have in most\r\ninstances been alive to their own interests, and have abandoned\r\ntheir ancient abodes on the verge of the river: so that the\r\ndestruction occasioned by future floods will be infinitely less\r\nextensive. But, still, a great part of the poorer class adhere to\r\ntheir ancient habitations, impelled by the double motive of\r\navoiding the cost of carrying their crops to these townships, and\r\nfrom thence back again to the river, in order to send them to\r\nmarket by the boats, which ply on it for this purpose. And to\r\nsuch as have not horses and carts of their own, and would\r\nconsequently be obliged to hire them, a residence on the banks of\r\nthe river is a saving of greater magnitude than might be at first\r\nimagined.\r\n\r\nThe greatest obstacle to the complete realization of the\r\ngovernor's project, arises from the extreme poverty of the great\r\nbody of the settlers, occasioned, as I have already noticed, by\r\nthe limited and precarious market afforded for their produce. To\r\nbuild a house, however small, is an undertaking in this colony as\r\nevery where else, which can only be effected with adequate means;\r\nand if the colonists do not resort in crowds to these townships,\r\nit is not because they are insensible to the advantages which\r\nthey would derive from a removal to these seats of security, but\r\nbecause their penury chains them to their present dangerous and\r\nmiserable hovels, and compels them in spite of their better\r\nreason to hold their lives and property on the most precarious of\r\nall tenures, the caprice of the elements. But could the governor\r\nsucceed in this, his project to the utmost, could he induce every\r\nsettler on the banks of the Hawkesbury to remove to these\r\ntownships, he would be still far from guaranteeing the colony\r\nfrom the calamitous effects of these inundations; since they are\r\nnot periodical, like the risings of the Nile, but happen at all\r\ntimes, as well when the crops are in stack as when growing, when\r\nthey are in the infancy of vegetation, as when they have attained\r\nmaturity and are fit for the sickle. Some other expedient,\r\ntherefore, would still be necessary to guard against those\r\ninundations which may happen at such disastrous periods; and\r\nthere is but one that will be found sufficient at all times and\r\nunder all circumstances. It is to encourage by artificial means,\r\nthe growth of corn so far beyond what is necessary for the bare\r\npurposes of food, that in years of scarcity, whether arising from\r\nflood or drought, these artificial channels of consumption may be\r\nstopped, and the whole of the corn in the colony appropriated to\r\nthe supply of the inhabitants. And this encouragement would be\r\namply afforded by the establishment of distilleries; since\r\nallowing the colony to require sixty thousand gallons of spirits\r\nannually, twenty thousand bushels of grain would be expended in\r\ndistillation, the whole of which, when necessity required, might\r\nbe diverted from its ordinary course of consumption, and directed\r\nto the purposes of subsistence.\r\n\r\nThese advantages, great as they must be allowed to be, are not\r\nthe only ones that would follow the erection of distilleries.\r\nThis measure would still further promote the prosperity of the\r\nagricultural body, by creating in the market a competition with\r\nthe government for the purchase of grain, and would thus destroy\r\nthe _maximum_, that has been hitherto arbitrarily assigned\r\nas an equivalent for their produce generally, without reference\r\nto the state of the crops, whether they have been productive or\r\notherwise. The prejudicial operation of this maximum was noticed\r\nin the Report of the Select Committee of the House of Commons\r\nmade in the year 1812, and the propriety of devising some remedy\r\nfor this evil strongly enforced; but this recommendation has\r\nhitherto been disregarded, from the want, perhaps, of information\r\nsufficiently precise to enable the government of this country to\r\nattend to it.\r\n\r\nI close the catalogue of arguments which I adduce in support\r\nof this measure with the last and most powerful of them all, its\r\nbeneficial influence on the morality of the rising generation. I\r\ndo not so much take into calculation its probable bearing on the\r\nexisting race of colonists, the greater part of whom are and\r\nwill, perhaps, always be more or less addicted to the pernicious\r\nhabits contracted in their early days of riot and debauchery, as\r\non their posterity, who will necessarily soon form the majority\r\nof this colony, and whose amelioration or reformation all\r\nlegislative measures should have principally in view. With those\r\nthe immoderate use of spirituous liquors is a long contracted\r\ndisease, which it is perhaps past the skill of legislation to\r\ncure. It is like an old inveterate ulcer, whose roots have\r\npenetrated into the seats of vitality, and are so intimately\r\ninterwoven with the very principles of existence, that the knife\r\ncannot be applied to the extirpation of the one, without\r\noccasioning the destruction of the other. But though this\r\ngangrene can never be entirely eradicated, the experience of late\r\nyears has shewn that it may be prevented from increasing, and\r\neven considerably reduced. Drunkenness has been observed to be\r\nless frequent since the unlimited importation of spirits was\r\npermitted, even among that class who were most addicted to this\r\nvice during the long period when the importation was in a great\r\nmeasure restricted, the price of liquor exorbitantly enhanced,\r\nand the consequent difficulty of obtaining it much more\r\nconsiderable. Great, therefore, as are the present facilities to\r\nthe indulgence of this propensity, they should be still further\r\nextended, and this would be effected by internal distillation;\r\nfor although the importation of spirits from other countries has\r\nbeen for many years past subject to no restriction, but the\r\npayment of a certain duty, which would be equally levied on all\r\nspirits made in the colony, still the expence of freight,\r\ninsurance, etc. would be avoided, the price proportionably\r\nabated, and the means of indulgence increased in the same\r\nratio.\r\n\r\nThe immediate effect of this free circulation of spirits\r\nhaving been so beneficial, we may easily infer what would be its\r\nremote consequences; and it is to these, to the gradual\r\ndevelopement of moral perfection, that all laws which are framed\r\nwith a reference to this end, should be directed, and not to\r\nsudden and violent reformations, which are seldom or never\r\nattended with the desired results. It was, indeed, natural to\r\nexpect that this pernicious drug would be depreciated, in the\r\nestimation of its consumers, in exact proportion to its\r\nsuperabundance; and although the removal of all restriction to\r\nthe importation of spirits, might in its immediate beneficial\r\noperation on the morals of the existing generation, so long\r\ncurtailed in the use of them, and so long habituated to excess,\r\nwhenever occasion offered, have been a matter of serious\r\nspeculation, before this experiment was tried, its immediate\r\nresult has far out-stripped the expectations of its most sanguine\r\nsupporters. The present influence of this measure having been so\r\nsatisfactory, there cannot be a doubt that the effect of internal\r\ndistillation on the morality of future generations will be still\r\nmore salutary and decisive. It is well known that in the\r\ncountries that are celebrated for the production of wines and\r\nspirits, as France, Spain, Italy, etc. so great is the sobriety\r\nof the people, that a drunken person is an object of contempt,\r\nand a sight which is but very seldom witnessed. This sobriety,\r\ntherefore, can only be the consequence of a steady, equable\r\nsupply, which induces moderate enjoyment, without holding out any\r\ntemptation to excessive indulgence. And however strange or\r\nunaccountable this fact may at first appear, the reason of it may\r\nbe traced to the nature of man, the same inconsistent creature in\r\nall ages and in all countries. Intervening obstacles to\r\nenjoyment, far from repressing his desires, serve but to\r\nstimulate and inflame them; and so perverse and capricious is he\r\nin his conduct, that he despises, or at best holds in but\r\nsecondary estimation, the real substantial good that is within\r\nhis grasp; while remote or unattainable objects fire his\r\nambition, and swell into fanciful and preposterous proportions\r\nthe treacherous illusions of a fertile imagination, which\r\npossession alone can dissipate and reduce to their proper\r\nstandard and value. It is thus that lofty mountains seem to\r\nconnect themselves with the heavens by enveloping clouds; but\r\nstripped of their deceptious covering, they stand reduced to\r\ntheir primitive dimensions, the blue vault towers far above their\r\nheads, and the eye sees and defines their just limits and\r\nmagnitude.\r\n\r\nThere can be but one objection urged against the establishment\r\nof colonial distilleries; that it will deprive the resident\r\nmerchants in India, from whence by far the greater proportion of\r\nspirits is at present imported into the colony, of this branch of\r\ncommerce. The trade, however, of that country is on too extensive\r\na scale, to be perceptibly affected by so trifling a restriction,\r\nwhich, in fact, has always existed till within the last five\r\nyears; as the importation of spirits, till that period, was\r\nalways subject to limitation, and only permitted by express\r\nlicence. But were the case otherwise, what right has one portion\r\nof the empire to look for aggrandisement at the expense of\r\nanother? Ought the welfare and happiness of twenty thousand\r\npersons to be sacrificed, in order to promote the views of a few\r\ninterested individuals? If it were politic in his majesty's\r\ngovernment to concede any superiority of privilege to any one\r\nbody of the king's subjects over another, surely a colony\r\ncomposed entirely of Englishmen has reason to expect that such a\r\nconcession should be made in its favour, and not to its prejudice\r\nin favour of a country acquired and in some measure maintained by\r\nforce, and connected with the parent country by no ties of common\r\norigin and affinity, by no congeniality of habit, by no\r\nsimilarity of religion. But the colonists neither expect nor\r\ndesire any such concessions: they seek the possession and\r\nenjoyment of their own indubitable rights; they would not curtail\r\nthose of others: they neither want to render other colonies\r\ntributary to their prosperity, nor to continue, as they have\r\nhitherto been, tributary to that of others.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, we take a hasty survey of the\r\nadvantages, which I trust it has been satisfactorily proved,\r\nwould be consequent on internal distillation, never, it will be\r\nseen, was there a measure which could adduce in its support more\r\nurgent and weighty considerations. It would afford employment,\r\nand thus impart fresh health and vigor to the agricultural body,\r\ndebilitated by long suffering and disease; it would place the\r\nmeans of the colonists on a level with their wants, and by\r\ncreating a good and sufficient medium of circulation in the place\r\nof the present worthless currency, would give rise to other\r\nchannels of industry, and to the speedy establishment of an\r\nexport trade. It is the only possible way of insuring the colony\r\nagainst the calamitous effects which have hitherto been\r\ninvariably attendant on the inundations of the river Hawkesbury;\r\nit would lessen the injurious preponderancy of the government in\r\nthe market, by creating a great competition for the purchase of\r\ngrain, and would thus prevent the arbitrary imposition on this,\r\nthe principal production of the colonists, of a maximum that is\r\nfrequently beneath its just value, and it would improve the\r\nmorals of the present and of future generations. With these\r\nirresistible arguments in favour of this measure, it must be\r\nevident that the cause of justice and morality would be violated\r\nby any further unnecessary delay in its adoption.\r\n\r\nThe next object of internal consumption, to which in my\r\nopinion the government ought to direct the attention of the\r\ncolonists, is the growth of tobacco. The amount of the annual\r\nimportation of this article from the United States of America and\r\nthe Brazils, (the two supplying countries) cannot be estimated at\r\nless than five thousand pounds. This would be a very material\r\nsaving to the colony in its present circumstances, and one that\r\nmight be effected with the greatest ease, and without prejudice\r\nto any part of the empire. The only question in this instance is,\r\nwhether it be more politic that the colony should supply itself,\r\nor be dependent on foreigners. There are no contending interests\r\nto reconcile, no portion of his majesty's subjects in any part of\r\nthe globe, who could wish to oppose the imposition of a\r\nprohibitory duty on the importation of this article into the\r\ncolony. And this is the only measure that would be necessary to\r\ndirect the attention of the settlers to this highly important\r\nproduction, for which it has been found that the climate and soil\r\nof the colony are peculiarly adapted. In three years at most,\r\nafter the adoption of this regulation, the colonists would raise\r\na sufficient quantity of tobacco for their own consumption. It\r\nwill be an after consideration for the government to take the\r\nrequisite means to promote the increased growth and exportation\r\nof this highly important product to the mother country. The\r\nimmense advantage that she would derive from possessing in one of\r\nher own colonies, an article of such general consumption, and for\r\nwhich she is at present entirely tributary to foreign powers, is\r\ntoo obvious to need illustration, and too considerable not to\r\nattract the attention and encouragement of her legislature.\r\n\r\nHemp, flax, and linseed, are also productions to which the\r\nclimate and soil of the colony, and its dependent settlements at\r\nthe Derwent and Port Dalrymple are remarkably congenial, and the\r\ngrowth of which might be easily promoted by wise regulations. Yet\r\nhighly valuable as are all these productions, and altogether\r\ndependent as is this country for the amazing quantities of them,\r\nwhich she consumes in her navy, her manufactures, and her\r\ncommerce, no attempt has been made since the establishment of the\r\ncolony to direct the attention of its inhabitants to their growth\r\nand exportation. The views of the different gentlemen, who have\r\nbeen successively intrusted with the government, have either\r\nnever reached so far, or else their means have been inadequate to\r\nthe accomplishment of these great ends. In embellishing the\r\ncapital, and erecting various public edifices, of which, however,\r\nI do not mean to question the utility, their attention appears to\r\nhave been chiefly absorbed. It seems never to have come into\r\ntheir contemplation that all these embellishments would have been\r\nthe natural and inevitable results of the increasing prosperity\r\nof the community, but that they could never of themselves either\r\ncreate or promote it. A flourishing agriculture, a thriving\r\ncommerce, would have equally effected all these objects; but with\r\nthis material difference, without that enormous expence to this\r\ncountry with which they have been attended. The imposition of\r\nsmall taxes for the promotion of public objects, is no grievance\r\nto a people whose prosperity is the work of a wise and\r\nconsiderative government. An impolitic and oppressive one cancels\r\nalike the will to make, and the power to levy such contributions;\r\nand imposes on itself the necessity of moderating its wants, or\r\nof having recourse to foreign channels for their supply. In this\r\ninstance the great burden of these public undertakings has fallen\r\non this country, nor have they been the most inconsiderable item\r\nin the amount of the colonial expenditure. Yet all that has been\r\nalready lavished, and all that this country may hereafter lavish\r\nin prosecution of the same narrow and absurd system, will have\r\nbut little influence in promoting the real purposes of\r\ncolonization.\r\n\r\nThis mania for building, which has always directed the\r\ngovernment, has unfortunately communicated itself to the\r\ncolonists, particularly those who inhabit the various towns, and\r\nthey are at present in the condition of a man who has a large\r\nhouse, but wants wherewithal to furnish and support it. Their\r\nsituation would be more enviable, if they had smaller habitations\r\nreplete with a greater degree of plenty and comfort. The\r\nestablishment of an export trade, that may enable them to procure\r\nin sufficient abundance those foreign commodities which long\r\nhabit has rendered indispensable to civilized life, is what they\r\ndesire, and what a wise government would desire also; more\r\nespecially since the parent colony is a great manufacturing\r\nnation, and possesses the power of supplying the commodities in\r\nquestion. Millions more expended in the same improvident manner\r\nas heretofore, will not effect this great object; and with half\r\nthe expence already incurred a politic government would have\r\nalready accomplished it. Of this assertion the labours of an\r\nindividual, who, if on the one hand he has met with some support\r\nfrom the more liberal and enlightened administration of this\r\ncountry, has constantly experienced, on the other, all the\r\nopposition which the envy and malevolence of the local government\r\ncould throw in his way, furnish an indubitable proof.\r\n\r\nThis gentleman, John Mac Arthur, Esq. formerly a captain in\r\nthe New South Wales corps, which was afterwards converted into\r\nthe 102d regiment, embarked more largely from the very\r\ncommencement of the colony, in the rearing of sheep and cattle,\r\nthan any other individual. Notwithstanding the very great profits\r\nwhich his extensive flocks and herds yielded him, a circumstance\r\nthat would have satisfied the ambition, and lulled to sleep the\r\ninquiries of a less penetrating mind, he foresaw so long as\r\nfifteen years back, what has since been realized, the crisis of\r\ngeneral distress and embarassment, to which the course pursued by\r\nthe local government, would eventually conduct; and on the\r\noccasion of his being unjustly ordered to this country by the\r\nthen governor, where he soon vindicated himself from the charges\r\nimputed to him, he convinced the ministry of the advantages that\r\nwould accrue to the nation from promoting in the colony the\r\ngrowth of fine wool; and obtained from them a considerable grant\r\nof land, and various encouragements besides, in order to enable\r\nhim to carry this highly important project into execution. Among\r\nother indulgences, he procured an order in council permitting him\r\nto embark on board the vessel that was to reconvey him to the\r\ncolony, four Spanish ewes and a ram, which he had purchased out\r\nof the king's flocks. With this small beginning he undertook, and\r\nin spite of an incessant war waged against him by malignity and\r\nmisrepresentation, the withholding in some measure of the\r\nencouragements ordered by the liberality of his majesty's\r\nministry, and endless other disappointments and vexations that\r\nwould have damped any ordinary resolution, his efforts have been\r\ncrowned with the most complete success, and he has at present not\r\nless than five thousand sheep, of which the wool from continual\r\ncrosses with Spanish tups, the progeny of the few sheep purchased\r\nby him at the sale of the king's flocks, has become as fine as\r\nthe best imported from Saxony, and has been found to surpass it\r\nin elasticity, a quality highly conducive to the firmness and\r\ndurability of the cloth. Many gentlemen also of the colony who\r\nhave large flocks, sensible of the folly of breeding sheep for\r\nthe mere sake of the carcases, which in consequence of the\r\nlimited population, and unlimited extent of grazing country, have\r\nalready become of inferior value, and in a short time more will\r\nbe worth little or nothing, entered some years back on this\r\ngentleman's system; and there may, perhaps, be among all the rest\r\nof the sheep holders, the same number of fine woolled sheep which\r\nhe alone possesses. Here then is an exportable article of immense\r\nconsequence to the colony, and of the highest political\r\nimportance to this country; an article indispensable to the\r\nsupport of her staple manufacture, and for which she has hitherto\r\nbeen altogether dependent on foreign nations; yet has no attempt\r\nbut the one I have just alluded to, been made, either by the\r\ngovernment of this country, or of the colony, to direct the\r\nattention of the sheep-holders to its production; on the\r\ncontrary, the greatest obstacles have been thrown in the way of\r\nthis gentleman's success, obstacles which none but the most\r\nenthusiastic spirit could have surmounted. Thanks, however, to\r\nhis invincible perseverance, the dawn of prosperity is at length\r\nbreaking on the colony. The long stormy night of suffering and\r\nmisery is drawing to a close; yet a few years, and the sun of\r\npeace and plenty will appear on its horizon. But although this\r\nevent will in the natural course of things soon take place, its\r\napproach may be greatly accelerated, or retarded by the wisdom or\r\nfolly of the government. The colonists, in spite of every\r\nimpediment they may have to encounter, cannot much longer remain\r\ninsensible to the advantages which _they_ possess, who have\r\nalready followed the wise example of this gentleman: _these_\r\nthey will daily behold in the enjoyment of comparative ease and\r\nhappiness, and in possession of a certain progressive income,\r\nexposed to few or no contingencies, and dependent on no man for\r\nits extent and duration; while on the other hand, they will find\r\nthat their own income must not only diminish every year, but also\r\nrest for its continuance on the good pleasure of their governor,\r\nwho, if he should even possess the will, would not want the power\r\nto enlarge it to any considerable amount, and who, should he be\r\ntheir enemy, might at any time reduce it to nothing. The manifest\r\nsuperiority, therefore, which the proprietors of fine woolled\r\npossess over those of coarse woolled sheep, would alone suffice\r\nin the end to draw the attention of all the sheep-holders in the\r\ncolony to the improvement and perfection of the wool of their\r\nflocks. This is happily a much easier task at present than at the\r\nperiod when Mr. Mac Arthur first entered on the system of\r\ncrossing. At that epoch there were few sheep in the colony, but\r\nsuch as had been introduced from the East Indies, which it is\r\nwell known are entirely covered with hair. This race, so\r\ndisgusting in its appearance to Englishmen, has long since\r\ndisappeared; nor are there any sheep at present, whose wool could\r\nbe termed actually coarse: the wool of the Leicester breed is\r\nperhaps the coarsest that could any where be found. A few years\r\ncontinual crossing with Spanish tups would consequently suffice\r\nto cover all the sheep in the colony with fine wool. Three\r\ncrosses which under a proper system would occupy about six years,\r\nwould be sufficient, if the government would employ the means at\r\ntheir disposal, to accomplish this great national object. The\r\nnumber of sheep in the month of November last amounted, as it has\r\nalready been seen, to 170,920; out of which, as I have just\r\nstated, 10,000 are of the pure Spanish breed or nearly: it may\r\ntherefore be perceived what an immense exportation of this\r\nprecious article might take place in a few years, under judicious\r\nand politic regulations.\r\n\r\nNo country in the world is perhaps so well adapted to the\r\ngrowth of fine wool as this colony. There is in its climate\r\nalone, a peculiar congeniality for the amelioration of wool,\r\nwhich has been found of itself to occasion in a few years, a very\r\nperceptible improvement in the fleeces of the coarsest\r\ndescription of sheep. Even the East India breed, entirely covered\r\nwith hair, produce without being crossed with a finer race a\r\nprogeny, the superiority of whose fleece over that of the parent\r\nstock is visible in every remoter generation. This amazing\r\ncongeniality of climate is supported by local advantages of equal\r\nif not greater importance. For hundreds of miles into the\r\ninterior, the country has been found to be covered with the\r\nrichest pasturage, and every where intersected with rivulets of\r\nthe finest water. A constant succession of hill and dale\r\ndiversifies the whole face of the country, which is so free from\r\ntimber, that in many places there are thousands of acres without\r\na tree.\r\n\r\nThe settlements at the Derwent and Port Dalrymple, though\r\nsituated in a colder climate, and therefore in all probability\r\nnot equally congenial to the growth of fine wool, afford the same\r\nexcellent pasture, and contain in every respect besides, the same\r\nfacilities for the rearing of Spanish sheep, whose fleeces it is\r\nreasonable to expect on comparing the climate of these\r\nsettlements, with that of Saxony, would not degenerate, if the\r\nsame system which prevails in that country were followed in the\r\nmanagement of sheep in this.\r\n\r\nSaxony is situated between the 50th and 51st parallels of\r\nnorth latitude; and Van Diemen's Land, on the northern and\r\nsouthern parts of which these two settlements are formed, between\r\nthe 41st and 43d degrees of south; so that allowing for the\r\nsuperior coldness of the southern hemisphere, the whole of this\r\nisland possesses a climate more congenial to the growth of wool,\r\nthan the finest parts of a country, whose wool exceeds in value\r\nthat of Spain and Italy. The settlers, however, have not yet\r\nopened their eyes to the advantage of having fine woolled flocks,\r\nalthough they have for many years past had but a very limited\r\nmarket for their mutton, and the government there, as at Port\r\nJackson, have made no efforts to turn their attention to this\r\nobject.\r\n\r\nThis unaccountable indifference to a matter of such vast\r\npolitical importance, it is to be hoped will at length be\r\nfollowed by a proper degree of attention and encouragement. Among\r\nall the various ends proposed by our extended colonial system,\r\nnone perhaps is more intrinsically worthy the cordial undeviating\r\nsupport of his majesty's government, than the one in question. In\r\ntwenty years, the extensive exportation which might be effected\r\nunder proper regulations in this single article, would alone\r\nraise the colonists from the point of depression and misery to\r\nwhich they have been reduced, to as high a pitch of affluence and\r\nprosperity as is enjoyed by any portion of his majesty's subjects\r\nin any quarter of the globe. Before the expiration of that\r\nperiod, I am convinced that they might be enabled to ship for\r\nthis country, at least a million's worth of fine wool annually;\r\nand for the accomplishment of this vast national object, it would\r\nnot be necessary for this country to expend one far-thing more\r\nthan is at present _wasted_ in prosecution of a system of\r\nmere secondary importance, and having little or no bearing on the\r\neventual prosperity of the colony. It is only by establishing\r\nthis prosperity on a solid basis, by encouraging the growth of\r\nexports, until they rise to a level with its imports, that it can\r\nbe converted from an unproductive and ruinous dependency into a\r\nprofitable and important appendage. Whenever it shall have\r\nattained this point of advancement, whenever it shall have\r\nacquired an independence in its resources, then, and not before,\r\nwill it begin to answer the real ends of all colonization, the\r\nextension of the commerce and rescurces of the empire. Then like\r\nsome vast river of the ocean, will it pour back its majestic\r\nstream into the bosom of its parent flood, and contribute to the\r\ncirculation and salubrity of its bounteous author.\r\n\r\nAmong the various remaining articles of export, which the\r\ncolony is capable of producing, and to which the industry of its\r\ninhabitants might be gradually attracted, the last two that I\r\nshall specify, are the vine and the olive. These, indeed, with\r\nthe various productions which I have already named, are capable\r\nof such vast extension, as to be fully adequate to absorb all the\r\nenergies of the colonists for many years to come, whatever may be\r\nthe increase in their numbers. To mention, therefore, the endless\r\nless important productions to which the climate and soil of this\r\ncolony are equally congenial, would only be to perplex their\r\nchoice, and to divert, perhaps, their industry into less\r\nproductive channels. It would be superfluous to dwell upon the\r\nhappy results that would attend the general introduction and\r\nculture of these two productions, both with reference to them as\r\narticles of internal consumption and exportation; since it is\r\nwell known how materially they contribute to the comfort and\r\naffluence of the countries which are blessed with them. I shall,\r\ntherefore, only just mention that the greatest facilities have\r\nbeen lately afforded for their general culture by the same\r\ngentleman who first introduced the Spanish sheep into the colony;\r\nand that there is only now wanting the fostering hand of the\r\ngovernment to occasion their further propagation.\r\n\r\nOne of the most efficacious measures that could be adopted, as\r\nwell for their general introduction, as for that of the various\r\nother valuable productions before enumerated, would perhaps be\r\nthe establishment of a colonial plantation, in which a certain\r\nnumber of the most enterprizing youths might be instructed in\r\ntheir culture and preparation. This institution might, I am\r\nconvinced, be founded under a proper system without occasioning\r\nany considerable expence. The first step to be taken would of\r\ncourse be the selection of a fit allotment of ground, which ought\r\nto be granted to trustees, according to the usual forms of law.\r\nThese should consist of a certain number of gentlemen of\r\nconsideration in the colony, who would consent to hold this\r\noffice as an honorary one, without any view to private emolument,\r\nand for the mere sake of promoting the public weal. To place this\r\ninstitution near the capital, Sydney, where the greater part of\r\nthe land is already located, and besides of a very indifferent\r\nquality, ought not, by any means, to be attempted, not only for\r\nthese reasons, but also because the youth, whom it would be the\r\nmain object of this institution to train up to economical and\r\nlaborious pursuits, would run the risk of contracting the vicious\r\nhabits, and falling into the excesses of that town; a probability\r\nwhich a removal to a proper distance from that sink of iniquity,\r\nwould effectually provide against. The most eligible situation,\r\nperhaps, for the establishment of this highly important\r\ninstitution would be some fertile spot in the cow pastures,\r\nwhich, as it has been already mentioned, are injudiciously\r\nreserved for the use of the wild cattle, notwithstanding that\r\nthey have nearly disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe only two individuals who have grants of land in this\r\ndistrict are Messrs. Mac Arthur and Davison; and my\r\nrecommendation that this institution should be formed in the same\r\ndistrict, is not more influenced by the fertility of its soil\r\nthan by the contiguity which it would in this case possess to the\r\nformer gentleman's estate; a contiguity, which would enable him\r\nfrequently to visit it, and to afford the director of it such\r\ninformation as could not fail to contribute very materially to\r\nits progress and success. It must be quite unnecessary for me to\r\ndwell on the importance of confiding the superintendence of such\r\nan establishment to some one, who might be duly qualified for the\r\ndischarge of the duties that would be attached to it. Perhaps the\r\ngovernment would act wisely, if my suggestion on this head should\r\nbe deemed worthy of attention, in selecting for this office an\r\nintelligent person from the South of France, who has been\r\naccustomed to the culture of the vine and the olive. These with\r\ntobacco, hemp, and flax, are the objects to which, I am of\r\nopinion the attention of such an institution would be most\r\nbeneficially applied. And if, as is not improbable, it should be\r\nfound impracticable to procure a person acquainted with the\r\nculture and preparation of all these various productions, it\r\nwould not be difficult to discover among the colonists themselves\r\nmen of good character possessing the knowledge in which he might\r\nbe deficient, and who might be assigned him as assistants, but\r\nstill placed under his direction and control. The encouragement\r\nwhich I consider should be held out to the director, as well as\r\nto his subordinate agents, ought not to consist of stipulated\r\nsalaries, which might superinduce lethargy, and prevent them from\r\ncontributing their utmost to the success of the establishment,\r\nbut of a certain proportion of the clear profits of the concern,\r\nafter the deduction of all contingent expences. What I conceive\r\nthis proportion ought to be, I will hereafter specify, as also\r\nthe manner in which I would distribute the remainder. The\r\nsubjects which I propose for immediate consideration are: 1st,\r\nThe manner in which this institution might be founded; 2dly, The\r\nnumber and description of the candidates to be admitted, with the\r\nmanner of their occupation; and, lastly, the nature of the\r\nencouragement to be accorded them.\r\n\r\nThe means necessary for this undertaking must be unavoidably\r\nsupplied by the government. \"The Police Fund\" is so burdened with\r\ncharges of one sort or another, that I fear it would prove of\r\nitself inadequate to the completion of this measure; although\r\nthere can be no doubt, that most of the ends to which this fund\r\nis at present devoted are of but subordinate utility, and might\r\nbe very advantageously postponed to the object under\r\nconsideration. The erection of the different buildings that would\r\nbe immediately required for the various incipient purposes of\r\nthis institution, and the supply of its inmates with provisions\r\nand the requisite implements of husbandry during the first\r\neighteen months of its establishment, after which period I\r\nconsider they would be fully able to administer in these respects\r\nto their own wants, would be the principal expences to be\r\nincurred. About £6000 would suffice for these objects;\r\nwhile, in return, its operation would gradually extend itself to\r\nevery district, would develope and bring to maturity various\r\nexportable commodities, which are as yet lying in embryo, and\r\nwhich this country does not possess in any of her colonies; and,\r\nin fine, would be more sensibly felt, and become more extensively\r\nbeneficial, in proportion to its own progressive march towards\r\nperfection.\r\n\r\nSecondly, With respect to the number of candidates to be\r\nadmitted, they ought perhaps, in the first instance, to be\r\nlimited to fifty, although they might, and indeed ought to be\r\nsubsequently increased to not fewer than two hundred. More than\r\nthose in the commencement, before a due degree of order and\r\neconomy could be introduced, would undoubtedly create confusion\r\nand an unnecessary augmentation of expence. Fifty are as many as\r\nI conceive could be advantageously occupied for the first two or\r\nthree years. It must, however, be obvious, that the capability of\r\nthis institution for the reception and profitable employment of a\r\ngreater number of pupils, would very materially depend on the\r\ndirector, and be, in a great measure, accelerated or retarded by\r\nhis ability or incompetency for a due discharge of his\r\nduties.\r\n\r\nAs to the description of these candidates, it would, I\r\nconsider, be proper that they should consist of young men born in\r\nthe colony, or who may have come to it with their parents; that\r\nthey should not exceed eighteen years of age, nor be under\r\nfifteen; that they should be of docile tempers and regular\r\nhabits, which points should be ascertained previously to their\r\nadmittance; and that their parents or guardians should bind them\r\napprentice for the space of four years to the trustees or\r\ndirectors of this establishment for the time being, during which\r\nperiod they should renounce all control over them whatever.\r\n\r\nI will not here pretend to prescribe all the various modes of\r\noccupation which it might be proper to allot them; I have already\r\nenumerated those productions, the culture of which I conceive\r\nmight be most advantageously taught and disseminated by means of\r\nthis institution. Others, however, of equal and perhaps greater\r\nutility, may be hereafter suggested by persons more conversant\r\nwith the situation and interests of the colony, and ought\r\nunquestionably, if there be any such, to become identified with\r\nthose which I have specified. Whatever may be the decision of\r\nmore competent judges than myself on this subject, I may perhaps\r\nconfidently venture to recommend, that the pupils should be\r\ndivided into classes, that each of these should be instructed in\r\na particular sort of culture at a time; and that upon the\r\nattainment of a thorough knowledge how to cultivate and prepare\r\nany one article, and not before, their attention should be\r\ndirected to some other, and so on, till the expiration of their\r\nseveral apprenticeships. It would be proper also to allow their\r\nparents or guardians the selection of the occupations in which\r\nthey might wish their children or wards to be instructed, in so\r\nfar at least, as such occupations might be compatible with any of\r\nthe purposes of the institution.\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, with reference to the nature and extent of the\r\nencouragements to be accorded to the pupils, I would recommend,\r\nin order that their energies might be stretched to the greatest\r\npossible point of extension, that six eighths of the net annual\r\nprofits arising from their labours should be set apart, and\r\nremain in the hands of the trustees, for their sole use and\r\nbenefit; and that on their retiring from this institution, the\r\naccumulated amount should be equally divided among them, both to\r\nsecure their successful establishment in life, and to render the\r\nknowledge which they may have severally acquired, of permanent\r\nbenefit to the community. I would also recommend that the\r\naccounts both of the expenditure and profits of the institution\r\nshould be annually submitted to the trustees for their approval,\r\nand afterwards printed and distributed among the pupils, not only\r\nfor the purpose of provoking inquiry into their accuracy, and\r\nobtaining that rectification in case of error, which it might be\r\ndifficult to effect after the lapse of five years; but also with\r\na view to bring home to their understandings, and to convince\r\nthem beyond the possibility of doubt, of the benefits which they\r\nmay have derived from their past labours; a conviction that would\r\nprove the most cordial incentive, the most powerful lever which\r\ncould be applied to their future industry and exertion. I would\r\nlastly recommend, that the quantity of land, and indeed that the\r\nencouragements of every kind which the government are in the\r\nhabit of granting to the ordinary class of settlers, should be\r\nincreased in a two-fold proportion to the pupils of this\r\ninstitution; but as it evidently would not be expedient or\r\nequitable that those who might habitually violate the regulations\r\nto be made for the good government of this little community,\r\nshould receive on the one hand an equal recompence with those\r\nwhose conduct might have always been regular and exemplary, or\r\nthat they should be deprived on the other of their quota of the\r\nemoluments that might accumulate during the period of their\r\napprenticeships, I would suggest, in order to mark that due\r\ngradation which in every well regulated society must necessarily\r\nexist in the scale of rewards to be accorded to such as may be\r\nsubordinate or refractory,--industrious, or idle; that these\r\nlatter encouragements should only be extended in this double\r\nratio to those who might quit the establishment with a\r\ncertificate of good conduct from the director.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the allowance to be made the gentleman to whom\r\nthe directorship might be confided, I should imagine that one\r\neighth of the clear profits arising from the institution, would\r\nbe a most liberal compensation for his trouble and attention, and\r\nthat the remaining eighth would be an equally handsome provision\r\nfor the whole of his assistants: one of whom would be required\r\nfor the superintendence and instruction of each of the classes\r\ninto which it might be determined that the pupils should be\r\ndivided.\r\n\r\nSuch are the principal measures which are essential to the\r\nrevival of the agricultural prosperity. I will now briefly notice\r\nthe various restrictions with which the commercial interests have\r\nbeen not less injudiciously fettered, and the removal of which is\r\nof the highest importance to the progress and welfare of the\r\ncolony. These may be divided into two heads, duties and\r\ndisabilities; and first, with reference to the duties with which\r\nthe various articles of export that the colonists possess or\r\nprocure, have been shackled by the successive governors. The\r\nduties in question are enumerated in the following schedule, and\r\nare levied upon the undermentioned articles, whether they are\r\nintended for home consumption or for exportation, in which latter\r\ncase it will be seen that some few of them are even doubled.\r\n\r\nOn each ton of sandal wood                                        £2  10  0\r\nOn each ton of pearl shells                                        2  10  0\r\nOn each ton of beche la mer                                        5   0  0\r\nOn each ton of sperm oil                                           2  10  0\r\nOn each ton of black whale or other oil                            2   0  0\r\nOn each fur seal skin                                              0   0  1½\r\nOn each hair ditto                                                 0   0  0½\r\nOn each kangaroo ditto                                             0   0  0½\r\nOn cedar or other timber from Shoal-haven, or any other part\r\nof the coast or harbours of New South Wales (Newcastle excepted,\r\nas the duties are already prescribed there) when not supplied by\r\ngovernment labourers, for each solid foot -010 For every twenty\r\nspars from New Zealand or elsewhere100On timber in log or plank\r\nfrom New Zealand, or elsewhere, for each solid foot                0   1  0\r\nFor each ton of coals from Newcastle for home consumption          0   2  6\r\nDitto if exported                                                  0   5  0\r\nFor each thousand square feet of timber for home consumption       3   0  0\r\nDitto if exported                                                  6   0  0\r\n\r\n\r\nThat all these duties should be levied on these different\r\narticles, in as far as they may be consumed in the colony, may be\r\nhighly expedient; but that they should be equally levied on\r\nexportation, and in two of the most material instances doubled,\r\nis so manifestly absurd, that it must be quite superfluous to\r\ndilate on the subject. It is a system of policy which it may be\r\nsafely asserted is unknown in any other part of the world; and\r\nnothing but the indubitable certainly of its existence would\r\nconvince any rational person that it could ever have entered into\r\nthe contemplation of any one intrusted with the government of a\r\ncolony. These duties have had the effect which might have been\r\nexpected from them; they have in most instances amounted to\r\nactual prohibitions. Their operation, indeed, has been found so\r\nburdensome and oppressive, that the colonial merchants have\r\nfrequently petitioned the local government for relief; but no\r\nattention whatever has been paid to their repeated\r\nrepresentations and remonstrances. Had it not been for the duties\r\non coals and timber, some hundred tons of these valuable natural\r\nproductions would have been exported annually to the Cape of Good\r\nHope and India; since the vessels which have been in the practice\r\nof trading between those countries and the colony have always\r\nreturned in ballast; and the owners or consignees would,\r\ntherefore, have gladly shipped cargoes of timber or coals, if\r\nthey could have derived the most minute profit from the freight\r\nof them. This observation holds good in a great measure with\r\nrespect to the various other articles which have been enumerated:\r\nthe exportation of the whole has been greatly circumscribed by\r\nthe same ridiculous and vexatious system of impost. It can hardly\r\nbe credited that the veriest sciolist in political economy could\r\nhave been guilty of such a palpable deviation from its\r\nfundamental principles; but it is still more unaccountable, that\r\na succession of governors should have pertinaciously adhered to a\r\nsystem of finance so absurd and monstrous.\r\n\r\nHighly injurious, however, as are the duties which are levied\r\nin the colony, they are not nearly so oppressive as those which\r\nare levied in this country, on spermaceti, right whale, and\r\nelephant oils procured in vessels built in the colony. The duties\r\non the importation of such oil into this country, are £24\r\n18s. 9d. for the first sort, and £8 6s. 3d. for the two last.\r\nIf we add to these enormous duties those which are levied\r\nby the authority of the local government, it will be perceived\r\nthat all the spermaceti oil procured by the colonial vessels\r\nhas to pay a duty of £28 8s. 9d. and all the right whale and\r\nelephant oil a duty of £10 6s. 3d. before it can come into\r\ncompetition with the oil of the same description\r\nprocured in vessels built in the united kingdom. It has, however,\r\nbeen seen, that the colonists, propelled not less by that spirit\r\nof enterprize which distinguishes Englishmen in every quarter of\r\nthe globe, than by the desire of finding profitable employment\r\nfor that large portion of unoccupied labour, of which I have\r\nhastily pointed out the causes and march for the last fifteen\r\nyears, have frequently attempted, notwithstanding these\r\noverwhelming prohibitions, to carry on these fisheries, but\r\nalways without success; and that the valuable fishery of right\r\nwhales which the river Derwent affords at a particular season, is\r\nnow only resorted to, in order to procure the trifling supply of\r\noil which is requisite for the East India market and for internal\r\nconsumption. All attempts to export oil to this country have been\r\nfor many years abandoned; since the trade could only be\r\nmaintained at a dead loss, as the ruinous experience of many of\r\nthe colonial merchants has abundantly attested. The reason why\r\nthese enormous duties were imposed on oil procured in the\r\ncolonial vessels is not generally understood here, but it is\r\nuniversally known in the colony; and the knowledge has materially\r\ntended to increase the dissatisfaction which the imposition of\r\nsuch duties would of itself, to a certain extent, have naturally\r\nexcited. The act which authorizes these duties, is one of those\r\nsmuggled acts by which, to the disgrace of our legislature, the\r\nwelfare and happiness of helpless unprotected thousands have been\r\nso frequently sacrificed on the shrine of individual avarice or\r\nambition. It originated in a certain great mercantile house\r\nextensively concerned in the South Sea fisheries, and could never\r\nhave been passed, had there been a single person in either house\r\nof parliament, at all interested in the prosperity of this\r\ncolony. This act, indeed, is such a terrible deviation, such a\r\nmonstrous exception to the usual policy of this country with\r\nrespect to the fisheries, that it carries with itself the\r\nstrongest internal evidence of its polluted origin. No such\r\nrestrictions had ever before been imposed on any of our colonies,\r\nas will be sufficiently evident, if we compare the duties which\r\nare levied in this country on oils procured in the vessels\r\nbelonging to the colonies in North America and the West Indies,\r\nwith those which are levied on oils procured in the vessels\r\nfitted out from the united kingdom. These duties are as\r\nfollow:\r\n\r\n*Train oil, the produce of fish, or creatures living in the\r\nsea, taken and caught by the crew of a British built vessel,\r\nwholly owned by his majesty's subjects, usually residing in Great\r\nBritain, Ireland, or the islands of Guernsey, Jersey, Alderney,\r\nSark, or Man, registered and navigated according to law, and\r\nimported in any such shipping, per ton                         0  8  3¾\r\n\r\n[* See Pope's Practical Abridgment of the Laws of\r\nCustoms and Excise, etc. etc. Title 246.]\r\n\r\nTrain oil, the produce of fish, or creatures living in the\r\nsea, taken and caught on the banks and shores of the island of\r\nNewfoundland and parts adjacent, wholly by his majesty's subjects\r\ncarrying on such fishery from that island, and residing therein,\r\nand exported directly from thence in a British built ship or\r\nvessel, registered and navigated according to law, per ton     1  4 11¼\r\n\r\nTrain oil, the produce of fish, or creatures living in the\r\nsea, taken and caught wholly by his majesty's subjects, usually\r\nresiding in any of the Bahama or Bermudas islands, or in any\r\nBritish plantation in North America, and imported in a British\r\nbuilt vessel, registered and navigated according to law, per\r\nton                                                            3  6  6\r\n\r\nTrain oil, the produce of fish, or creatures living in the\r\nsea, taken and caught wholly by his majesty's subjects, usually\r\nresiding in any other British plantation, territory, or\r\nsettlement, and imported in a British built vessel, registered\r\nand navigated according to law, per ton                        8  6  3\r\n\r\nSpermaceti oil, or head matter, taken and caught by the crew\r\nof a British built vessel, wholly owned by his majesty's\r\nsubjects, usually residing in Great Britain, Ireland, and the\r\nislands of Guernsey, Jersey, Alderney, Sark, or Man, registered\r\nand navigated according to law, and imported in any such vessel,\r\nper ton                                                        0  8  3¾\r\n\r\nSpermaceti oil, or head matter, taken and caught on the banks\r\nand shores of the island of Newfoundland and parts adjacent,\r\nwholly by his majesty's subjects carrying on such fishery from\r\nthat island, and residing therein, and imported directly from\r\nthence in a British built vessel registered and navigated\r\naccording to law, per ton                                      1  4 11¼\r\n\r\nSpermaceti oil, or head matter, taken and caught wholly by his\r\nmajesty's subjects, usually residing in any of the Bahama or\r\nBermudas islands, or in any British plantation in North America,\r\nand imported in a British built vessel, registered and navigated\r\naccording to law, per ton                                      4 19  9\r\n\r\nSpermaceti oil, or head matter, taken and caught wholly by his\r\nmajesty's subjects, usually residing in any other British\r\nplantation, territory, or settlement, and imported in a British\r\nbuilt vessel, registered and navigated according to law, per\r\nton                                                           24 18  9\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing statement it will be perceived that the\r\nduty levied on train oil, or spermaceti oil, or head-matter\r\nprocured by the inhabitants of Newfoundland, is precisely the\r\nsame, and only three times the amount of _that_ which is\r\nlevied on the same substances procured by British subjects\r\nresiding in the united kingdom; and that the duty levied on oil,\r\nprocured by British subjects residing in the Bahama, or Bermudas\r\nislands, or in the plantations in North America, is only\r\n_eight_ times the amount on train oil, and _twelve_\r\ntimes the amount on spermaceti oil or head-matter, of _that_\r\nwhich is levied on the same substances taken by British subjects\r\nresiding within the united kingdom. While on the other hand, the\r\nduty levied on oil procured _in any other colony_; (for\r\nmark, the contrivers of this act had sufficient cunning not to\r\nparticularize the unfortunate colony against which it was levied)\r\nis _twenty times greater_ on train oil, and oh, _monstrous\r\ninjustice!_ upwards of _sixty times_ greater on\r\nspermaceti oil, or head-matter, than _that_ which is levied\r\non similar substances taken by British subjects residing within\r\nthe limits of the united kingdom. The duty, therefore, which is\r\npayable on train oil procured in vessels belonging to this colony\r\nis _nearly seven times_ greater than _that_ which is\r\npayable on the same description of oil taken in vessels belonging\r\nto the island of Newfoundland, and _considerably more than\r\ndouble that_ which is payable on it, when taken in vessels\r\nbelonging to the Bahama or Bermudas islands, or to the\r\nplantations in North America; while the duty which is levied on\r\nspermaceti oil, or head-matter, procured in vessels belonging to\r\nthis colony, is _five times_ the amount of _that_ which\r\nis levied on such oil or head-matter, when taken in vessels\r\nbelonging to the Bahama, or Bermudas islands, or to the\r\nplantations in North America; and _twenty times_ the amount\r\nof _that_ which is levied on similar substances when taken\r\nin vessels belonging to Newfoundland. This very unequal\r\nproportion which the duties levied on these two sorts of oil, if\r\nprocured by the inhabitants of this colony, bear to each other\r\nwhen compared with the duties which are levied on the same\r\nsubstances if procured by the inhabitants of any of the foregoing\r\ncolonies or plantations, furnishes an additional proof, were any\r\nrequired, of the correctness of my assertions with respect to the\r\norigin of the act by which they were imposed. The house who were\r\nthe authors of it, could not consistently get the duty on one\r\ndescription of oil raised, without at the same time admitting the\r\nnecessity for raising the duty on the other; but as they were not\r\ninterested in the right whale fishery, they were only anxious to\r\nprevent the colonists of New South Wales from embarking in the\r\nsperm whale fishery; and could they have accomplished this object\r\nwithout running the risk of discovering the covert aim of the act\r\nin its progress through parliament, they would have gladly\r\ncompromised this point with them, and have left the right whale\r\nfishery open to them on the same conditions as it was before the\r\nenactment of this bill. To have evinced, however, any such\r\ntolerant inclination might have betrayed their design, and\r\naccordingly the colonists were debarred from both the fisheries;\r\nfor notwithstanding that regular gradation has by no means been\r\nadhered to in the imposition of these duties, which had been\r\npreviously observed in the scale of the duties levied in the\r\nother colonies or plantations, they have in both instances been\r\nmore than sufficient to constitute actual prohibitions.\r\n\r\nThat any superiority of privilege whatever should have been\r\nconceded by the legislature of this country, in the various acts\r\nwhich have been passed for the encouragement of the fisheries, to\r\nBritish subjects residing within the limits of the united\r\nkingdom, is at best a manifest injustice to such of her subjects\r\nas inhabit the colonies; but yet so long as this partiality was\r\nconfined within any reasonable bounds, it would not have excited\r\nany considerable feeling of dissatisfaction. That there should,\r\nhowever, be any gradation in the scale of duties to be levied on\r\nany description of merchandise procured or produced in the\r\ncolonies themselves, is a system which it is impossible to\r\nreconcile with any principle of justice or policy. Still so long\r\nas this disproportion of impost, however unwise and unjust, did\r\nnot become so burdensome and oppressive as to confine this branch\r\nof commerce, whatever it might be, to the privileged colony or\r\ncolonies, some palliation might be offered by its advocates for\r\nits continuance, although the warmest of them would not be able\r\nto attempt its vindication. But that any one colony should be\r\nutterly excluded from privileges freely accorded to another, is\r\nsuch a monstrous stretch of tyrannical partiality, that it never\r\ncould have been deliberately discussed in a free government, and\r\nmust therefore have been contrived by the secret machinations of\r\nprivate avarice and corruption.\r\n\r\nCan any reason be adduced why British subjects residing in one\r\ncolony, should be excluded from the whale fisheries more than\r\nBritish subjects residing in another? Why vessels built in\r\nCanada, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, or the Bahama islands, should\r\npossess a privilege denied to vessels built in New Holland or Van\r\nDiemen's Land? The whale fishery is not more contiguous to the\r\ninhabitants of the former colonies than to those of the latter;\r\nyet every encouragement is afforded for the carrying on of the\r\none, and every obstacle thrown in the way of the successful\r\nprosecution of the other. Why such a broad line of distinction is\r\ndrawn, it is impossible to divine; since the disability which is\r\nthe consequence of it, is not only not in furtherance of any of\r\nthe ends contemplated by the navigation act,* but in diametrical\r\nopposition to the whole of them. This will be evident if we refer\r\nto its preamble, and to a few of its prominent provisions.\r\n\"Whereas for the increase of shipping and encouragement of the\r\nnavigation of this nation, wherein under the good providence and\r\nprotection of God, the wealth, safety, and strength of this\r\nkingdom is so much concerned; it is enacted that no goods, or\r\ncommodities whatsoever, shall be imported into, or exported out\r\nof any lands, islands, plantations or territories to his Majesty\r\nbelonging, or in his possession, or which may hereafter belong\r\nunto or be in the possession of his Majesty in Asia, Africa, or\r\nAmerica, in any other vessels whatsoever, but in such vessels as\r\ndo truly and without fraud belong only to the people of England,\r\nIreland, or are of the built of and belonging to any of the said\r\nlands, islands, plantations, or territories as the proprietors\r\nand right owners thereof, and whereof the master and\r\nthree-fourths of the mariners at least are English, under the\r\npenalty of the forfeiture and loss of all the goods and\r\ncommodities which shall be imported into, or exported out of any\r\nthe aforesaid places, in any other vessel, as also of the vessel\r\nwith all its tackle,\" etc. From this, which is the principal\r\nclause of the act, it clearly appears that British subjects in\r\nwhatever part of the empire they may happen to reside, are\r\nentitled to precisely the same privileges, and that vessels built\r\nin any of her colonies are to all intents and purposes to be\r\ndeemed of British built, in the same manner and on the same terms\r\nand conditions as if they had been built within the limits of the\r\nunited kingdom, i. e. so long as the master and three fourths of\r\nthe crew are British subjects. That this admission to a perfect\r\nequality of privilege, was and is still the intent not only of\r\nthe navigation act, but of all the leading acts of navigation\r\nwhich have been passed since, we shall be still further\r\nsatisfied, if we trace them in their whole progress to the\r\npresent hour. It will not, however, be necessary to extend our\r\nexamination either way beyond the great registry act passed in\r\nthe twenty-sixth year of the reign of his present majesty, cap.\r\n60. \"By this act very considerable alteration was made in the\r\nwhole concern of registering shipping, with a view of securing to\r\nships of the _built_ of this country, a preference and\r\nsuperiority which they had not enjoyed so completely before. The\r\nplan of regulation then proposed to parliament was the result of\r\nan inquiry and deliberation of great length before the committee\r\nof Privy Council for the Affairs of Trade and Plantations; and\r\nthat inquiry was commenced and carried on, and the measure at\r\nlength decided upon principally by the exertion and perseverance\r\nof the late Earl of Liverpool.\"** What vessels are still deemed\r\nin this careful and elaborate revision of the navigation code to\r\nbe of _British built_, may be seen from the first clause of\r\nthis act, which ordains \"that no vessels _foreign built_\r\n(except such vessels as have been, or shall hereafter be taken by\r\nany of his Majesty's vessels of war, or by any private, or other\r\nvessel, and condemned as lawful prize in any court of admiralty)\r\nnor any vessel built or rebuilt upon any foreign-made keel or\r\nbottom, in the manner heretofore practised and allowed, although\r\nowned by British subjects, and navigated according to law, shall\r\nbe any longer entitled to any of the privileges or advantages of\r\na _British built ship_, or of a ship owned by British\r\nsubjects, and all the said privileges and advantages shall\r\nhereafter be confined to _such ships only_ as are _wholly\r\nof the built_ of Great Britain or Ireland, Guernsey, Jersey,\r\nand the Isle of Man, or of some of the plantations, islands, or\r\nterritories in Asia, Africa, or America, which now belong, or at\r\nthe time of building such vessels did belong, or which _may\r\nhereafter belong to_ or be in the possession of his Majesty;\r\nprovided always, that nothing hereinbefore contained shall extend\r\nto prohibit such foreign built vessels only as before the 1st of\r\nMay, 1786, did truly and without fraud wholly belong to any of\r\nthe people of Great Britain or Ireland, Guernsey, Jersey, and the\r\nIsle of Man, or of some of the plantations, etc. etc.\" Here then\r\nwe have cited the _two leading clauses_ in the _two\r\nleading acts_ of navigation, and both prove that the objects\r\nwhich this country had in view, were to create nurseries of\r\nseamen for her navy, and to secure to her subjects, in whatever\r\npart of her extended empire they might reside, the benefit of the\r\ncarrying trade. The imposition, therefore, of any duties on her\r\nsubjects in any of her colonies, greater than those which are\r\nlevied under similar circumstances on her subjects at home, far\r\nfrom being in unison with the liberal and enlightened policy of\r\nthe navigation laws, is a broad deviation from their fundamental\r\nprinciples, and the creation of an entire system of exclusion,\r\nsuch as the one under consideration is, _a fortiori_, an\r\nutter violation of their letter and spirit. That any prohibitory\r\nduties of this sort could ever have been enacted, will appear\r\nstill more surprising, if we look a little further into the\r\npolicy which this country has pursued with respect to her other\r\nfisheries, particularly the cod fishery on the banks of\r\nNewfoundland, and parts adjacent. For when by the 15th Charles\r\nII. cap. 7. she enlarged the scope of her great navigation act,\r\nand to the two main original objects contemplated in this act,\r\nviz. the creation of nurseries for seamen, and the securing to\r\nher subjects the carrying trade, she superadded a third, viz.\r\nthat of making herself the _entrepot_ for the deposit of all\r\ngoods and commodities, whether the growth, production, or\r\nmanufacture of Europe, or of her colonies, it having been\r\nforeseen that this alteration in her maritime code would be\r\nprejudicial to the cod fisheries, and that it would most\r\nmaterially conduce to their prosperity and extension still to\r\nallow salt, provisions, wine, etc. to be imported _directly_\r\nfrom various countries not subject to the dominion of the crown\r\nof England into the colonies from whence these fisheries are\r\ncarried on, this enlarged act,*** after ordaining \"that no\r\ncommodity of the growth, production, or manufacture of Europe\r\nshall be imported into any land, island, plantation, colony,\r\nterritory, or place to his Majesty belonging, or which shall\r\nhereafter belong unto, or be in the possession of his Majesty in\r\nAsia, Africa, or America, (Tangier only excepted) but what shall\r\nbe _bona fide_ and without fraud, laden and shipped in\r\nEngland, and in English built shipping, and whereof the master\r\nand three fourths of the mariners at least are English, and which\r\nshall be carried directly thence to the said lands, islands,\r\nplantations, colonies, territories or places, and from no other\r\nplace whatsoever, any law or usage to the contrary\r\nnotwithstanding, under the penalty of the loss of all such\r\ncommodities of the growth, production, or manufacture of Europe,\r\nas shall be imported into any of them from any other place by\r\nland or by water, and if by water, of the vessel also in which\r\nthey were imported with her tackle, etc. etc.\" immediately\r\nsubjoins:--\"Provided that it shall be lawful to ship and lade in\r\nsuch ships, and so navigated as in the foregoing clause is set\r\ndown and expressed in any part of Europe, salt for the fisheries\r\nof New England and Newfoundland, and to ship and lade in the\r\nMadeiras wines of the growth thereof, and to ship and lade in the\r\nWestern Islands, or Azores, wines of the growth of the said\r\nislands, and to ship and take in servants or horses in****\r\nScotland or Ireland, and to ship or lade in Scotland all sorts of\r\nvictual, the growth or production of Scotland, and to ship and\r\nlade in Ireland all sorts of victual of the growth or production\r\nof Ireland, and the same to transport into any of the said lands,\r\nislands, plantations, colonies, territories or places.\" Here then\r\nis an instance of a very material deviation from the spirit of\r\nthe navigation laws for the sole purpose of encouraging a\r\nfishery; but who can deny its policy? The legislature in this\r\ncase had to decide whether they would extend this great national\r\nnursery for seamen, or whether they would check its growth by\r\npreventing the direct trade between these colonies and Europe,\r\nMadeira, the Azores, etc. and by making herself the\r\n_entrepot_ for the deposit and exchange of all the produce\r\nof these fisheries on the one hand, and of the productions of\r\nEurope, etc. etc. that were necessary for their extension on the\r\nother. The advantages that she would have derived from such a\r\nselfish arrangement, she wisely foresaw would be more than\r\ncounterbalanced by the concomitant detriment which her maritime\r\ninterests would have sustained from it. And hence this deviation\r\nfrom one of the leading objects of her navigation laws, a\r\ndeviation which has not only been continued ever since, but even\r\nconsiderably enlarged; for many other places are now included in\r\nthe direct commerce with these colonies, as will be seen by\r\nreference to the 46 Geo. III. c. 116. which recites, \"whereas by\r\nthe laws in force no commodity of the growth, production, or\r\nmanufacture of Europe, is allowed to be imported into any place\r\nto his Majesty belonging, or which shall hereafter belong unto,\r\nor be in the possession of his Majesty in Asia, Africa, or\r\nAmerica, but what shall be _bona fide_ and without fraud,\r\nladen and shipped in Great Britain, or Ireland, except salt for\r\nthe fisheries of Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Quebec, which may\r\nbe laden in any port of Europe, and also except any goods fit and\r\nnecessary for the fishery in the British colonies or plantations\r\nin America, being the growth, produce, or manufacture of Great\r\nBritain or Ireland, or of the islands of Guernsey or Jersey,\r\nwhich may be shipped and laden in the said islands respectively\r\nby any of the inhabitants thereof, and also except wines of the\r\ngrowth of the Madeiras and the Western Islands, or Azores, which\r\nmay be laden at those places respectively: and whereas, it may\r\ntend to the benefit of the British fisheries, and to the\r\nadvantage of the commerce and navigation of this country, if\r\npermission was given for certain other articles to be shipped for\r\nthe British colonies in North America, at other places in Europe\r\nthan those hereinbefore mentioned, under certain regulations and\r\nrestrictions:\" it is therefore enacted that any fruit, wine, oil,\r\nsalt, or cork, the produce of Europe, may be shipped and laden at\r\nMalta, or Gibraltar, for exportation direct to the said\r\nplantations in North America, on board any British _built_\r\nvessel, owned, navigated, and registered according to law, which\r\nshall arrive with the produce of the said fisheries taken and\r\ncured by his majesty's subjects carrying on the said fishery from\r\nany of the said plantations, or from Great Britain or\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\n[* 12 Car. II. chap. 18.]\r\n\r\n[** Reeves, second edition, p. 397.]\r\n\r\n[*** 15 Charles II. cap. 7.]\r\n\r\n[**** England, Ireland and Scotland, since united\r\ninto one kingdom.]\r\n\r\nI have been thus copious in extracts from the navigation laws,\r\nto prove that the great leading principles of these laws would\r\nnot only be in no wise encroached upon by allowing the\r\ninhabitants of this colony to carry on the whale fisheries in\r\ntheir own vessels, but also that the duties which were thus\r\nclandestinely imposed on oils so procured, have been a flagrant\r\nviolation of them, and that they are a single isolated exception\r\nto a general rule. Nor would the abolition of the duties in\r\nquestion, and the consequent encouragement of these fisheries,\r\nprove injurious to the British merchants at home, as must have\r\nbeen apprehended by those who were the authors of the prohibitory\r\nlaw by which these duties were enacted. Looking, indeed, at the\r\nmere situation of the colony, it would not be unnatural to\r\nconclude that its contiguity to the sperm whale fisheries, on the\r\ncoast of New Zealand, New Caledonia, and New Guinea, would give\r\nits inhabitants such a decided advantage over the persons\r\ncarrying on the same fisheries from this country, that these\r\nlatter would soon be forced to abandon a ruinous competition, and\r\nthat she would consequently be deprived of the very important\r\nbenefits which she at present derives from it. The fears,\r\nhowever, which are apt to arise on this view of the subject will\r\nbe immediately dissipated if it be considered, that the rope,\r\ncanvas, casks, and gear of every description, necessary for the\r\noutfit of the colonial vessels for these fisheries, are furnished\r\nby this country, and can never be obtained in the colony under an\r\nadvance of fifty per cent. on the prime cost; that the sperm oil\r\nin the market is unequal to the demand for it, an assertion\r\nproved as well by the existing bounties held out by the\r\nlegislature for the encouragement of these fisheries, as by the\r\nenormous wages gained by the seamen employed in them; that these\r\nbounties themselves operate as a considerable prohibition to the\r\ncolonists; and, lastly, that many years must elapse before the\r\ncolonial fishermen can be properly organized, and rendered as\r\nexpert as the English. These various disadvantages under which\r\nthe inhabitants of this colony labour, are all but one of a\r\npermanent nature, and it is evident will always more than\r\ncounterbalance the single local superiority which they possess,\r\nand ensure the English merchants a decided advantage in the\r\nmarket;--an advantage which if it will not outstrip all\r\ncompetition, will at least only just permit that salutary\r\nopposition which is essential to the prevention of monopoly and\r\nto the interests of the public.\r\n\r\nIt must, I should imagine, by this time be quite obvious, that\r\nthe removal of the duties in question would be in complete unison\r\nwith the spirit of the navigation laws, and with that liberal and\r\nenlightened policy, which this country has on all other occasions\r\ninvariably observed, with respect to colonies in parallel\r\ncircumstances. In establishing, therefore, a precedent, I hope\r\nthat I have made out a case sufficiently strong to warrant the\r\ninterference of the legislature. It may not, however, be\r\naltogether superfluous, if it be only to point out the injury\r\nwhich this country has sustained from her past injustice and\r\nimpolicy, just to glance at the advantages that she would possess\r\nin future wars from having an extensive body of seamen at her\r\ndisposal in the South Pacific Ocean. Hitherto our squadrons in\r\nIndia have been entirely supplied with seamen from this country,\r\nand the great mortality which takes place on that station\r\nrequires this supply to be constantly kept up. It is well known,\r\nalthough fewer actions take place in the Indian seas than perhaps\r\non any other of our maritime stations, that the number of deaths\r\noccasioned by the influence of the climate alone are\r\nproportionally more considerable than in any other part of the\r\nworld, with the single exception, I believe, of the coast of\r\nAfrica. It becomes, therefore, a question of the greatest\r\nimportance, whether considered in a political or philanthropic\r\npoint of view, to ascertain if this lamentable expenditure of\r\nhuman life might not be considerably diminished by manning our\r\nships of war in the Indian seas with the inhabitants of New\r\nHolland. It is well known that our settlements in this vast\r\nisland are situated in a climate which forms a mean between the\r\ntemperature of this country and India. There is consequently\r\nevery probability, that the persons born in these colonies would\r\nbe able to support the extreme heats of India much better than\r\nEnglishmen. Be this, however, as it may, there can be no doubt of\r\nthe advantage which this country would derive from having a\r\nvaluable nursery for seamen in a situation, from which her navy\r\nin the East might at no very remote period be so easily supplied\r\non all occasions of emergency. This prospect cannot fail to prove\r\nan additional motive with the government for the abolition of\r\nduties, which, if persevered in, will for ever stifle all\r\ncommercial enterprize, and debar not only the colonists\r\nthemselves, but the parent country also from the various\r\nimportant advantages, which I should presume it is now evident\r\nthat an uncontrolled ability to prosecute these fisheries would\r\ninfallibly secure to one and the other.\r\n\r\nWith reference now to the commercial disabilities which have\r\nbeen imposed on this colony: the first impediment, the removal of\r\nwhich may be said to be of any material importance to its\r\nmercantile prosperity, is the clause in the East India Company's\r\ncharter*, which provides, \"that it shall not be lawful for any\r\nvessel, the registered measurement whereof shall be less than\r\nthree hundred and fifty tons, other than such vessels as may be\r\nemployed by the East India Company as packets, to clear out from\r\nany port in the united kingdom for any place within the limits of\r\nthe said company's charter, or be admitted to entry at any port\r\nof the united kingdom from any place within those limits.**\" When\r\nthis act was passed, the pernicious bearing of this clause on the\r\ncolony was most probably overlooked. It has been found\r\nprejudicial in the following respects:--First, The demand for\r\nBritish goods is not sufficiently extensive to absorb cargoes of\r\nsuch magnitude; so that when any such have arrived, they have\r\ngenerally been attended with a loss to the owners, who will\r\nprobably soon become too wise to continue such a hazardous\r\ncommerce. Those merchants, indeed, who were in the habit of\r\nshipping cargoes in smaller vessels for the colonial market,\r\nbefore the passing of this act, have already abandoned, in a\r\ngreat measure, their connexion within the colony, which is at\r\npresent chiefly dependent for its supplies of British\r\nmanufactures, on the captains of the vessels employed in the\r\ntransportation of convicts. These supplies, therefore, have\r\nnaturally become unequal and precarious: sometimes being\r\nunnecessarily superabundant and cheap, and at other times being\r\nso extremely scarce and dear as to be entirely beyond the reach\r\nof the great body of the consumers. Such great fluctuations are\r\nobviously not more repugnant to the well being and comfort of the\r\ncolonists themselves than to the mercantile interests of this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n[* 53 Geo. 3. c. 155.]\r\n\r\n[** The colony of New South Wales is within these\r\nlimits.]\r\n\r\nSecondly, The tendency of this act is not less injurious to\r\nthe colonists with regard to the few articles of export which\r\nthey are enabled to produce or collect for the British market.\r\nThese indeed are only three in number, wool, hides, and seal\r\nskins, and are at present very inconsiderable in quantity; but\r\nthe two former articles must necessarily increase every year, and\r\nwill at length become of great extent and importance. The\r\nprobable amount of the colonial exports has been already rated at\r\nabout £28,000, out of which I consider that not more than\r\n£15,000 worth is conveyed to this country. The remainder\r\nconsists of sandal wood, beche la mer, etc. exported principally\r\nto China. It may therefore be perceived that the whole of the\r\nannual exports of this colony would not suffice for half the\r\nfreight of a single vessel of the size regulated by the act in\r\nquestion. It happens, in consequence, that the different articles\r\nof export which the colonists collect, frequently accumulate in\r\ntheir stores for a year and a half, before it becomes worth the\r\nwhile of the captain of any of the vessels which frequent the\r\ncolony, to give them ship-room; and even then they do it as a\r\nmatter of _favour_, not forgetting, however, to extort an\r\nexorbitant return for their _kindness and condescension_.\r\nThe owners, indeed, of these vessels are so well aware of the\r\ninability of the colony to furnish them with cargoes on freight,\r\nthat they generally manage before their departure, to contract\r\nfor freights from some of the ports in India; a precaution which\r\nincreases still more perceptibly the difficulty which the\r\ncolonists experience in sending their produce to market. It must,\r\ntherefore, be evident that they suffer a two-fold injury from\r\nthis act, both as it prevents a regular supply of the colonial\r\nmarkets with British manufactures, and as it impedes the\r\nconveyance of their exports to this country. It is to be hoped,\r\nthen, that this unnecessary and oppressive provision of the act\r\nwill be revised, and that vessels of any burden will be suffered\r\nto trade between this country and the colony, until its increased\r\ngrowth and maturity shall have rendered the revision of obsolete\r\nefficacy.\r\n\r\nThe last disability of serious detriment to the colonists, is\r\nthat their vessels cannot navigate the seas within the limits of\r\nthe East India Company's charter. I say _cannot_; because,\r\nalthough since the late renewal of their charter vessels built in\r\nthis colony are, I should apprehend, entitled to all the\r\nprivileges of other British built vessels, so long as they are\r\nnavigated according to law, it has not yet attained sufficient\r\nstrength to be enabled to build vessels of the burden of three\r\nhundred and fifty tons; and if it even possessed this ability,\r\nsuch vessels could only convey the produce of the countries in\r\nthe Eastern seas, to which the free trade has lately been opened,\r\nto certain ports in the united kingdom. The colonists, therefore,\r\nare virtually precluded from trading in their own vessels within\r\nthese limits; a restriction highly injurious to them, and of no\r\nbenefit whatever to the company. Till within these few years the\r\nvessels built at the Cape of Good Hope were subject to a similar\r\nrestraint; but its useless and oppressive tendency became so\r\nglaring, and the restraint itself so obnoxious to the people who\r\nwere suffering under it, that it was at length removed by an\r\nOrder in Council, dated 24th September, 1814, which was made by\r\nvirtue of an act passed so long back as the 49th* year of the\r\nreign of his present Majesty. By the 57th Geo. 3. c. 95. this\r\nsettlement was expressly included, for all the purposes of the\r\nact, within the limits of the East India Company's charter. The\r\nsame reasons that sufficed for granting this privilege in the one\r\ninstance, are at least equally conclusive in the other; and it is\r\nto be hoped, that the legislature will soon release the colony of\r\nNew South Wales also from so grievous and unnecessary a\r\nrestraint. Indeed no new act for this purpose is necessary; for\r\nthe 57th Geo. 3. c. 1. after reciting, \"whereas it is expedient\r\nunder the present circumstances, that the trade and commerce to\r\nand from all islands, colonies, or places, and the territories\r\nand dependencies thereof to his Majesty belonging, or in his\r\npossession in Africa or Asia, to the eastward of the Cape of Good\r\nHope, excepting only the possessions of the East India Company,\r\nshould be regulated for a certain time in such manner as shall\r\nseem proper to his Majesty in Council, notwithstanding the\r\nspecial provisions of any act or acts of parliament, that may be\r\nconstrued to affect the same,\" enacts, \"that it shall be lawful\r\nfor his Majesty in Council, by any order to be issued from time\r\nto time, to give such directions, and make such regulations\r\ntouching the trade and commerce to and from the said islands,\r\ncolonies, or places, and the territories and dependencies\r\nthereof, as to his Majesty in Council shall appear most expedient\r\nand salutary; any thing contained in any act of parliament now in\r\nforce relating to his Majesty's colonies and plantations, or any\r\nother law or custom to the contrary in any wise notwithstanding.\"\r\nIt may, therefore, be perceived that the disability in question\r\nmight be removed by a simple Order in Council. Whenever his\r\nMajesty's government shall have freed the colonists from this\r\nuseless and cruel prohibition, the following branches of commerce\r\nwould then be opened to them: First, they would be enabled to\r\ntransport in their own vessels their coals, timber, spars, flour,\r\nmeat, etc. to the Cape of Good Hope, the Isle of France,\r\nCalcutta, and many other places in the Indian seas, in all of\r\nwhich markets more or less extensive exist for these and various\r\nother productions which the colony might furnish; Secondly, they\r\nwould be enabled to carry directly to Canton the sandal wood,\r\nbeche la mer, dried seal skins, and in fact all the numerous\r\nproductions which the surrounding seas and islands afford for the\r\nChina market, and return freighted with cargoes of tea, silks,\r\nnankeens, etc. all of which commodities are in great demand in\r\nthe colony, and are at present altogether furnished by East India\r\nor American merchants, to the great detriment and dissatisfaction\r\nof the colonial. And, lastly, they would be enabled in a short\r\ntime, from the great increase of capital which these important\r\nprivileges would of themselves occasion, as well as attract from\r\nother countries to open the fur trade with the north-west coast\r\nof America, and dispose of the cargoes procured in China; a trade\r\nwhich has hitherto been** exclusively carried on by the Americans\r\nand Russians, although the colonists possess a local superiority\r\nfor the prosecution of this valuable branch of commerce, which\r\nwould ensure them at least a successful competition with the\r\nsubjects of those two nations.\r\n\r\n[* Cap. 17.]\r\n\r\n[** Many attempts have been made by the legislature\r\nto encourage British subjects to carry on this commerce from the\r\nports of the united kingdom, but they have in a great measure\r\nfailed in this object: see Convention with the King of Spain, 33\r\nGeo, 3. c. 52. Indeed, during the period of the Company's\r\nexclusive trade with China, it can only be successfully\r\nundertaken by persons residing within the limits of their\r\ncharter.]\r\n\r\nSuch are the principal alterations in the policy of this\r\ncolony which appear most essential to its progress and welfare.\r\nAll these indeed, and many other privileges, which, though of\r\nonly secondary consideration, would tend like a constant\r\nconcurrence of small rivulets to swell and enlarge the stream of\r\ncolonial prosperity, would be the natural consequences of a free\r\nrepresentative government. If I have, therefore, gradually\r\nascended from effect to cause, after the manner of experimental\r\nphilosophy, I have chosen this mode of elucidation, not because\r\nit was the only one which offered for the illustration of my\r\nsubject, but because I consider the inferences to be drawn from\r\nit more satisfactory than those to which the opposite mode of\r\nreasoning (that of descending from generals to particulars)\r\nconducts; because it would be as easy that the abolition of the\r\nvarious grievances which have been enumerated should be coeval\r\nwith the creation of the free constitution, by which such\r\nabolition would be eventually accomplished; and lastly, because\r\nthe additional tedious delay which would otherwise intervene\r\nbetween the establishment of a colonial legislature, the\r\nrepresentation of grievances by which it would be followed, and\r\ntheir consequent removal,--a process that would occupy two years,\r\nmight be thus avoided; or in other words, the same period of\r\nunnecessary endurance and misery spared to the ill fated\r\ninhabitants of this colony. In recommending, however, that the\r\ngovernment of this country should authorize the immediate\r\nadoption of the measures which I have proposed, I do not mean to\r\nimply that such authorization alone would be productive of the\r\nimportant results in contemplation. However extensively\r\nbeneficial in their present and remote effects the privileges\r\nthus conferred might prove, they would nevertheless be\r\nunsatisfactory and incomplete, so long as they were unaccompanied\r\nwith a government competent and willing to watch over and secure\r\ntheir continuance. While it should be in the power of any\r\nindividual to suspend or annul them, what guarantee, in fact,\r\nwould exist for their permanence and durability? What solid basis\r\non which the capital and industry, which they might be calculated\r\nto elicit, could repose in security?\r\n\r\nThe confidence, indeed, which an impartial governor might\r\ninspire, would most probably, as often as the colony might be\r\nblessed with a chief of this description, give a momentary\r\nimpulse to the activity of the colonists, and create a temporary\r\nprosperity among them; but the shortness of his administration\r\nwill always interrupt the completion of his projects, and the\r\ncaprice, imbecillity, or injustice of some one or other of his\r\nsuccessors, like the blast of the sirocco, wither up the tender\r\nshoots of prosperity, which a consistent and protecting\r\ngovernment would have nurtured and brought to maturity. The\r\nexperience of the past has sufficiently evinced the little\r\ndependence which is to be placed on the degree of countenance and\r\nprotection which the system of one governor, however beneficial\r\nthe prosecution of it might prove, is likely to meet with from\r\n_his successor_. It is, indeed, in the nature of man, to\r\nprefer his own projects to those of any other: there is a degree\r\nof pleasure in striking off from the beaten path, and rambling in\r\nthe untrodden wilds of speculation and experiment, which is alone\r\nsufficient, without the help of bad motives, to account for the\r\ndiversity of policy, by which the administrations of the various\r\ngovernors have been contra-distinguished. This inherent principle\r\nof our nature, so averse to the realization of every beneficial\r\ndesign, which is not capable of immediate development, ought\r\nevidently to be counteracted and not encouraged, as it is at\r\npresent, to the utmost point to which an uncontrolled and\r\nridiculous caprice may choose to indulge it. The existing system\r\nof government is, in fact, a woof of inconsistency, from which no\r\ngreat harmonious tissue can proceed. A gentleman is appointed to\r\nthis important situation: on his arrival in the colony he finds\r\nno council, no house of assembly, not even a colonial secretary\r\nto assist him: a stranger, and naturally unacquainted with its\r\ninterests, he is necessarily obliged to have recourse to some\r\nperson or other for advice: to avoid the appearance of ignorance,\r\nwhich however he cannot but possess, he will not most probably\r\napply to the gentleman whom he supersedes; and he again, from a\r\nprinciple of delicacy, will not be forward in offering his advice\r\nunsolicited: those who had been the assistants, and perhaps able\r\nassistants of the latter, will keep aloof, as much out of respect\r\nto the gentleman whom they had last served, as from that fear of\r\nobtrusion, that feeling of diffidence, which is inherent in\r\npersons of real merit and probity; so that it is ten to one but\r\nhe falls into the hands of the faction who had been the enemies\r\nof his predecessor, only perhaps because he had too much honour\r\nand integrity to promote their selfish views, at the expence of\r\nthe public weal. Scarcely, therefore, will this gentleman have\r\nquitted the colony, before the whole of the superstructure which\r\nhe had been rearing will have been pulled down, and another of a\r\ndifferent description commenced in its stead. Such has almost\r\ninvariably been, and such will continue to be the conduct of the\r\nactual government; nothing judicious or permanent can ever be\r\nexpected to proceed from it. How then, it may be asked, can\r\nprosperity be expected to flow from sources so precarious and\r\ninconstant? Are they calculated to supply that regular equal\r\nstream of security and confidence which has been found essential\r\nto the progress of improvement? But were the existing system of\r\ngovernment essentially conservative in its nature, instead of\r\nbeing virtually destructive, it would still prove inadequate and\r\ninefficient. The circumstances and wants of this colony will vary\r\nevery year, and consequently require either such partial\r\nmodifications or entire alterations of policy as may be suited to\r\neach progressive stage of advancement. Its government, therefore,\r\nought to be so constituted, as not only to possess the power of\r\nrevising old laws, but also of framing new ones. It ought, in\r\nfact, to involve in itself a creative as well as a conservative\r\nfaculty; a faculty which might enable it to accommodate its\r\nmeasures to every change of situation, and provide an instant\r\nremedy for every unforeseen and prejudicial contingency. Nothing\r\nshort of this will suffice to inspire that confidence which alone\r\ncan be productive of permanent prosperity. The government of an\r\nindividual, however respectable he may be, will always engender\r\ndistrust and cramp exertion. Man is distinguished from the rest\r\nof the creation by his circumspection and providence. There must\r\nexist a moral probability of reaping before he will venture to\r\nsow. This cautious calculating disposition too, is most\r\npredominant in those who are in the most easy circumstances:\r\nwhere the liability to incur loss is greatest, the spirit of\r\nenterprize is generally most restrained. But this class, which\r\ncontains the great capitalists of all countries, are precisely\r\nthose whose means, if they could be _enticed_ into activity,\r\nwould be productive of the most beneficial results. No soil is so\r\nbarren, no climate so forbidding, as not to present facilities\r\nmore or less favourable for the absorption of capital, and the\r\nextension of industry. Wherever the tide of improvement is at its\r\nheight, and a reflux ensues, it is to the impolicy of the\r\ngovernment, and not to the sterility of the country, that this\r\nretrogradation is to be attributed. Prosperity and happiness\r\nbelong to no climate, they are indigenous to no soil: they have\r\nbeen known to fly the allurements of the fertile vale, and to\r\nnestle on the top of the barren mountain: the plains of Latium\r\ncould not secure their stay, yet have they freely alit on the\r\nsnow-capt summits of Helvetia: they have been the faithful\r\ncompanions of freedom in all her wanderings and persecutions:\r\nthey have never graced the triumphs of injustice and\r\noppression.\r\n\r\nI have now hastily sketched the principal incidents which have\r\ncharacterized the march of this colony during the last fifteen\r\nyears. If I have neglected representing its more early efforts;\r\nif I have excluded from view the amazing difficulties and\r\nprivations with which its immediate founders had to contend; if,\r\nin fine, I have altogether omitted in the picture the numerous\r\ninteresting events that took place during the first fifteen years\r\nof its establishment, I have been induced to all these omissions\r\nby a conviction, that the existing system of government, if not\r\nthe most eligible that could have been devised, was at least\r\nunproductive of those glaring ill consequences, with which it has\r\nsubsequently been attended. A singleness of design and a unity of\r\naction, could not be deviated from during the period of its\r\ninfancy by the most ignorant and inexpert bungler in political\r\nscience. There was a broad path open to its government, which it\r\ncould not possibly mistake. The colony as yet entirely dependent\r\non external supplies, always precarious from their very nature,\r\nbut rendered still more so by a tedious, and at that time almost\r\nunexplored navigation, would unavoidably turn its whole attention\r\nto the single object of raising food, and emancipating itself as\r\nsoon as possible, from so uncertain and dangerous a dependence.\r\nThe principle of fear would have sufficed to propel the colonists\r\nto a spontaneous application of their strength to the realization\r\nof this end, independent of any directing power whatever. It was,\r\ntherefore, only on the attainment of this most important point,\r\nthat the impolicy of the present form of government became a\r\nmatter of speculation, and subsequently, that it has been\r\ndemonstrated by its practical result,--the wretched situation to\r\nwhich it has reduced a colony, that might be made, as I have\r\nsatisfactorily established, one of the most useful and\r\nflourishing appendages of the empire. It is at the epoch when the\r\nproduce of the colonists began to exceed the demand, and when\r\ntheir industry, instead of being encouraged and directed into new\r\nchannels of profitable occupation, was not only left to its own\r\nblind unguided impulse, but also placed under the most impolitic\r\nand oppressive restrictions, that I have taken up the pencil, and\r\nmade a rapid but faithful delineation of the deplorable\r\nconsequences that have been attendant on a concatenation of\r\ninjudicious and absurd disabilities, which, though not altogether\r\nimposed by its immediate government, would have been easily\r\nremoved by the more weighty influence of a combined\r\nrepresentative legislature. I have therefore throughout the whole\r\nof this essay, considered the present government not only\r\nresponsible for its own impolitic conduct, but also for the\r\nexistence of those grievances which have been created by a higher\r\nauthority, and of which it has wanted the will or the power to\r\nprocure the repeal. I have commenced by glancing at some of the\r\nmost striking events that ancient history affords, to prove that\r\nthe prosperity of nations has kept pace with the degree of\r\nfreedom enjoyed by their citizens, and that their decadence and\r\neventual overthrow have been invariably occasioned by a selfish\r\nand overwhelming despotism. Descending to more modern times, and\r\nadverting to the condition of existing nations, I have shewn that\r\nthe unparalleled power and affluence of our own country, which I\r\nhave selected out of them by way of exemplification, are solely\r\nto be attributed to the superior freedom of her laws, which have\r\nengendered her a freer, more virtuous, and more warlike race of\r\npeople. From these striking illustrations, this steady\r\ncoincidence of cause and effect, deduced from the records of the\r\ngreatest among ancient and modern empires, I have concluded that\r\nevery community which has not a free government, is devoid of\r\nthat security of person and property which has been found to be\r\nthe chief stimulus to individual exertion, and the only basis on\r\nwhich the social edifice can repose in a solid and durable\r\ntranquillity. That the system of government adopted in the colony\r\nof New South Wales does not rest on this foundation stone of\r\nprivate right and public prosperity, I have proved from the\r\ndetestable tyranny and consequent arrest of a governor, whose\r\nconduct anterior to his being intrusted with this important\r\ncharge, it will have been seen, was such as might have led\r\nwithout any extraordinary powers of discrimination to a\r\nprediction of the catastrophe that befel him. The atrocities\r\nperpetrated by this monster, and the events to which they gave\r\nrise, are sufficient to convince the most incredulous, that the\r\ncolonists have no guarantee for the undisturbed enjoyment of\r\ntheir rights and liberties, but the impartiality and good\r\npleasure of their governor; and that they have no resource but in\r\nrebellion against the unprincipled attacks and unjustifiable\r\ninroads of arbitrary power. So radically defective, indeed, is\r\nthe government to which they are subjected in its very\r\nconstitution, that it not only holds out, in the uncontrolled\r\nauthority which it vests in the hands of an individual, the\r\nstrongest temptations for the exercise of tyranny to those who\r\nmay habitually possess an overbearing and despotic temperament,\r\nbut has also a manifest tendency, as history amply attests, to\r\nvitiate the heart, and to produce a spirit of injustice and\r\noppression in those who may have been antecedently distinguished\r\nby a well regulated and humane disposition. While it is thus, on\r\nthe one hand, calculated to beget the most monstrous atrocities\r\nwithin the sphere of its jurisdiction, I have shewn that it has\r\nnot, on the other, been invested by the power to whom it owes its\r\norigin and existence with the ability to perform any extended\r\ngood; and that while it involves in its essence all the elements\r\nof destruction, it possesses no one principle of vitality. Of\r\nthis assertion the administration of Governor Macquarie, who if\r\nyou may judge from the length of time during which he has held\r\nthis high office, would appear to possess a greater portion of\r\nthe confidence of his Majesty's ministers, than any of his\r\npredecessors, furnishes an indubitable proof: for relieved as the\r\nmind of the reader will have been from the undivided indignation,\r\ndisgust, and abhorrence, which the excesses committed in the\r\nforegoing government cannot fail to excite, by a review of the\r\nprudence and moderation by which his career has been\r\ncontra-distinguished, he will nevertheless have beheld the\r\ncolony, from the want of privileges, of which this gentleman has\r\nnot possessed sufficient influence to procure the authorization,\r\nsinking in spite of his upholding hand, from a comparative state\r\nof affluence and comfort, to the lowest depth of poverty and\r\nendurance. He will have seen the colonists checked in their\r\nagricultural pursuits, rushing promiscuously into every avenue of\r\ninternal industry that lay open to them, and afterwards\r\nconstructing vessels, and not only exploring every known shore\r\nwithin the limits of their territory, in search of sandal wood,\r\nbut even discovering unknown islands abounding with seals. He\r\nwill have viewed them exhausting these temporary sources of\r\nrelief, and attempting, but obliged to desist by the weight of\r\nimpolitic imposts, both internal and external, from those\r\ninexhaustible fountains of wealth, the valuable whale fisheries\r\nthat exist in the adjacent seas. He will have beheld them from\r\ninability to purchase the more costly commodities of other\r\ncountries, making the most astonishing exertions in manufactures,\r\nand thus impelled by necessity to the adoption of a system not\r\nmore averse to the interests of the parent country than to their\r\nown; and which under a well regulated government, would have been\r\none of the last effects of maturity and civilization. He will\r\nhave witnessed, notwithstanding these vigorous and unnatural\r\nefforts, numbers of them bending every day beneath the pressure\r\nof embarrassment, and at length stripped of their lands, and\r\ndeprived of their freedom, by a set of rapacious and unprincipled\r\ndealers, who are gradually rendering themselves masters of the\r\npersons and property of the agriculturists; the greater part of\r\nwhom, if the present system continue a few years longer, will be\r\nvirtually reduced to a state of bondage, and condemned to\r\nminister to the ease and enjoyments of the worthless and the\r\nvile. He will have seen that, while the poorer settlers have\r\nalready in general fallen victims to the unjust and impolitic\r\ndisabilities with which they are beset, the circle of distress\r\nhas extended itself from these, the _central body_ of the\r\ncommunity, to its _circumference;_ and that the imports have\r\nso constantly preponderated in the balance over the united weight\r\nof the income and exports, that the whole wealth of the colony\r\nhas been continually flowing into foreign countries, for the\r\npayment of the necessary commodities furnished by them, leaving\r\nno money in circulation for the important purposes of domestic\r\neconomy, and compelling the colonists by a general, constrained,\r\nand tacit convention, to tolerate, as a substitute for a\r\nlegitimate circulating medium, a currency possessed of no\r\nintrinsic value whatever. He will have beheld this rapid torrent\r\nof distress forcibly driving back the tide of population, both by\r\nthe difficulties which it throws in the way of rearing up a\r\nfamily, and by the numerous bodies of freed convicts, whom it\r\npropels to a return to their native country, the greater part of\r\nwhom, more from necessity than choice, are led to a resumption of\r\ntheir ancient habits, in order to procure a subsistence, and\r\neither impose on the government the expense of retransporting\r\nthem to this colony, or end their career of iniquity by falling\r\nvictims to the vengeance of the laws which they had so often\r\nviolated. He will have seen during these continual and violent\r\nconcussions, by which the whole social edifice has been shaken to\r\nthe foundation, that the expenditure of the colony has been in a\r\nstate of the most rapid increase, and that the existing system of\r\ngovernment is incompatible with its diminution. He will, in fine,\r\nhave been satisfied that the immorality and vice which it was the\r\nmain object of the legislature to repress and extirpate, are\r\nmaking the most alarming progress and extension.\r\n\r\nLooking a little beyond these, the actual results of the\r\npresent order of things, he will find that it is affording the\r\nmost efficacious assistance and encouragement to the perfection\r\nof the manufacturing system, already in a state of considerable\r\nadvancement, and that a few years more will so greatly\r\ncircumscribe the means of the colonists, that the majority of\r\nthem will be entirely excluded from the use of foreign\r\ncommodities, and compelled to content themselves with the homely\r\nproducts of their own ingenuity; and that thus not only one of\r\nthe great ends of colonization, the creation of a market for the\r\nconsumption of the manufactures of the parent country, will be\r\ndefeated by her own impolitic conduct, but also a spirit of\r\nanimosity will be engendered by the recollection of the\r\nprivations and sufferings encountered by the colonists in their\r\ntedious and painful march to this unnatural independence in their\r\nresources; a spirit which will be handed down from father to son,\r\nacquiring in its descent fresh force, and settling at length into\r\nan hereditary hatred, which it will no longer be in the power of\r\nthe government to extinguish, and which will propel them,\r\nwhenever an opportunity offers, to renounce the control of such\r\nunwise and unfeeling masters. Passing from this gloomy picture of\r\nvexatious tyranny and unmerited suffering, he will proceed to the\r\nmore grateful contemplation of the remedies that are proposed as\r\na cure for the present evils, and as a preventive against the\r\nfuture tremendous eruption with which the existing system, a\r\nmountainous agglomeration of impolicy and barbarity, is so\r\nfatally pregnant. He will be satisfied that the application of\r\nthe restoratives prescribed, will both reintegrate the\r\nagricultural body, now in the last stage of debility and\r\nconsumption, and impart fresh life and vigour into the\r\ncommercial, which is equally impaired; and that while the parent\r\ncountry will by these means restore the tone and energies of the\r\ncolony, she will be contributing in the most effectual manner to\r\nher own strength and greatness. He will be persuaded that all\r\nthese most desirable ends will inevitably follow the\r\nestablishment of a free representative government; and that\r\nhowever salutary the adoption of the measures proposed might be,\r\nunaccompanied with that internal power of legislation from which\r\nthey would have eventually proceeded, they would of themselves be\r\nutterly inadequate to effect a perfect and permanent cure for the\r\nexisting evils; and that nothing short of a local legislature,\r\nproperly constituted, can on the one hand either inspire into\r\ncapitalists that confidence which is essential to the free\r\nunimpeded extension of industry, or be competent on the other, to\r\nprovide an instant relief for those growing wants, which spring\r\nout of the progress of advancement, and are contingent on those\r\nchanges of circumstances and situation, to which incipient\r\ncommunities are so peculiarly liable. He will, in fine, be\r\nconvinced even to demonstration, that the erection of a free\r\ngovernment in the colony of New South Wales would be a panacea\r\nfor all its sufferings; that it is the only measure which can\r\nease this country of the enormous burden which it will otherwise\r\nentail on her, and save the unspent millions that will be\r\ningulphed, _uselessly_ ingulphed, in the devouring vortex of\r\nthe present system; and that the creation of an export trade of\r\nraw materials, and the consequent extended consumption of her\r\nmanufactures which the proposed change of government would\r\nsuperinduce, is the only way in which she can ever repay herself\r\nfor the immense expence that she has lavished on this colony, as\r\nwell during the period of its really helpless infancy, as during\r\nthe still longer interval of its restrained growth and fictitious\r\nimbecillity.\r\n\r\nPART IV.\r\n\r\nVARIOUS CHANGES PROPOSED IN THE SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\nIt being thus clear and indubitable that free representative\r\ngovernments are the only foundation on which the prosperity and\r\nhappiness of communities can safely repose, it only remains to\r\nascertain how far the actual circumstances and situation of this\r\ncolony are compatible with the concession of so great and\r\nimportant a privilege. At my very offset in this essay, after\r\nglancing in a cursory manner at the history of the most\r\ncelebrated ancient and modern empires, and shewing that their\r\nprogress kept pace with their freedom, and that their\r\nretrogradation is to be dated only from the epoch when they fell\r\nunder the dominion of arbitrary and ambitious despots, whose\r\nsuccessors gradually completed the work of destruction which they\r\nhad commenced, I was compelled in candour to admit that the\r\nheterogeneous ingredients of which this colony was compounded,\r\ndid not at the period of its foundation, afford his Majesty's\r\ngovernment the power, if they had even possessed the will, to\r\nestablish a free representative system. It is therefore incumbent\r\non me, now that I have demonstrated the beneficial influence\r\nwhich free governments have in promoting the prosperity of\r\ncommunities in general, and have proved that this colony has for\r\nmany years been languishing in a state of impeded growth, and\r\ntottering imbecillity, from the inefficiency of its\r\nadministration to adopt those measures which are necessary to its\r\nrevigoration; I say it is incumbent on me to shew that the\r\ncomponent parts of this body politic, have undergone such a\r\nchange since the period of its creation, as will warrant its\r\nidentification in this respect with other states, and justify the\r\nconclusion that such institutions are essential to its welfare as\r\nhave been found conducive to theirs.\r\n\r\nIt must be almost superfluous to state, that when this colony\r\nwas formed, it was composed, with the exception of its civil and\r\nmilitary establishments, entirely of convicts. It was\r\nconsequently impossible that a body of men, who were all under\r\nthe sentence of the law, and had been condemned for their crimes\r\nto suffer either a temporary suspension, or total deprivation of\r\nthe civil rights of citizens, could be admitted to exercise one\r\nof the most important among the whole of them, the elective\r\nfranchise; and to have vested this privilege in the civil and\r\nmilitary authorities, both of whom then as at present were\r\nsubject to martial law, and were besides at that time without\r\nlanded property, the only standard I conceive by which the right\r\neither of electing or being elected can in any country be\r\nproperly regulated, would have been equally improper and absurd.\r\nA council indeed might have been appointed, but even an\r\ninstitution of this kind might have clogged the wheels of the\r\ngovernment by its opposition, and could have been of but little\r\nassistance with its advice; for as it has been already stated,\r\nthere was but one object to be pursued, and that was to promote\r\nby every means the agriculture of the colony, so as to emancipate\r\nit as soon as possible from a precarious and dangerous dependence\r\non other countries. Until, therefore, the free inhabitants of the\r\ncolony had increased to a sufficient number to exercise the\r\nelective franchise, and until its productive powers had\r\noutstripped its consumptive, and it became necessary either to\r\ncreate new markets for its produce within, or to direct a portion\r\nof its strength to the raising of articles for exportation to\r\nother countries, the establishment of a free representative\r\ngovernment would not have been expedient had it even been\r\npracticable.\r\n\r\nThe period at which the produce of this settlement fairly\r\nexceeded the internal demand for it, may, as I have already\r\nnoticed, be dated so far back as the year 1804, being about\r\nsixteen years after the period of its foundation. It has been\r\nalready seen that the harvests of that and the succeeding year\r\nwere so abundant, that no sale could be obtained for more than\r\none half of the crop;--that had it not been for a tremendous\r\nflood which happened in 1806, the majority of the cultivators\r\nmust have abandoned their farms, and sought for other\r\noccupation;--and that since that period there has fortunately\r\nbeen a succession of floods and droughts, which with the\r\nexception of two or three seasons of equal plenty, have kept the\r\nproductive powers of the colony nearly on a level with its\r\nconsumptive, or else the situation of the settlers, deplorable as\r\nit now is, would have been infinitely more so. How radically\r\ndefective, then, must be the government of this colony, when what\r\nwould be calamities of the most serious and afflicting nature in\r\na well organized community are here blessings! Is it in the\r\nnature of things to adduce more weighty arguments in proof of the\r\nnecessity which has existed since the above period for its\r\nsupercession? Ought not a government that would have felt the\r\nimportance, and have possessed the power of creating new channels\r\nof consumption for agricultural produce to have been then\r\ninstituted? This great object, it has been already shewn, could\r\nhave been in no way so easily accomplished as by the erection of\r\ndistilleries. To have diverted the attention of any part of the\r\nagriculturists from the growth of corn, would have been highly\r\nimpolitic in a country, where the greatest and most fertile\r\nportion of the arable land is subject to such awful inundations.\r\nOn the contrary, it was and still is expedient, that the whole\r\nagricultural energies of the colony should be confined to the\r\nproduction of grain, until the surplus become so great as to\r\nleave no chance whatever of these inundations being any longer\r\nattended with their former baneful consequences. But this can\r\nonly be effected by creating a sure and adequate market for this\r\nsurplus; and whether such market is to be found in the colony, or\r\nto be sought for abroad, no power either would have been, or is\r\nso fully competent to accomplish this important purpose, as an\r\nindependent legislature chosen from the midst of the community,\r\nwhose interests are identified with its own.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the expediency or even practicability of\r\ninstituting a body of this nature so long as fourteen years back,\r\nI am aware that there exists a great difference of opinion among\r\nthe respectable class of the colonists themselves. For my own\r\npart, however small may have been the number of those from or by\r\nwhom a colonial legislature could at that time have been formed,\r\nI consider of but little moment in solving this great problem.\r\nThe only question it appears to me to be ascertained, is, whether\r\na legislative assembly, however small the number of whom it might\r\nhave been composed, and however limited the body of electors by\r\nwhom it might have been chosen, would not have done its utmost to\r\npromote its own interests, or what would have been the same\r\nthing, the welfare of the community which it represented. I\r\ncannot conceive the possibility of any one's doubting that such\r\nwould have been its conduct; and in this case what power could\r\nhave been instituted in the colony that would have been so well\r\ncalculated to foster its infant efforts, and develope its nascent\r\nprosperity, as one that would have been invested with the\r\nfaculties of legislation; or in other words, with the authority\r\nto enact as a matter of course those measures of which the\r\nexisting government has not had sufficient influence to procure\r\nthe authorization.\r\n\r\nThe expediency, however, of having established a house of\r\nassembly in the colony at the period in question, is at this\r\nmoment, perhaps, rather a matter of curious speculation, than of\r\nprofitable inquiry. Extensively beneficial, as would in all\r\nprobability have been its effects, it is nevertheless useless to\r\ndeplore an omission which cannot now be remedied. Nor has the\r\nabsence, perhaps, of this important institution been altogether\r\nwithout its advantages. It has at least indisputably proved the\r\ninefficiency of the present system of government, and that the\r\ncolony could not have sunk under any other form of administration\r\nwhatever, to a lower ebb of poverty and wretchedness, nor have\r\nbecome a heavier and more unproductive burthen to the mother\r\ncountry. The want, therefore, of an internal legislature has\r\ncombined every consideration that could be adduced in proof of\r\nthe necessity of changing the present system, and adopting in its\r\nstead that form of government which has been found so salutary\r\nand efficacious in all countries where it has been established.\r\nThe only question that remains to be ascertained, is whether the\r\ncolony is _now_ in a state of maturity for the reception of\r\nso important a privilege as the elective franchise; and this I\r\nconceive will be best answered by a reference to the numerical\r\nstrength of its free population. At the general muster or census\r\nconcluded on the 19th of November, 1817, there were found to be\r\nin all the various settlements and districts of the colony of New\r\nSouth Wales, and its dependencies, twenty thousand three hundred\r\nand twenty-eight souls, of whom sixteen thousand six hundred\r\nand sixty-four were in the various towns and districts belonging\r\nto Port Jackson. Out of these there were six hundred and ten\r\nsoldiers, and six thousand two hundred and ninety-seven convicts,\r\nleaving a free population, independent of the military, of nine\r\nthousand seven hundred and fifty-seven souls. At Newcastle, a\r\nsettlement about sixty miles to the northward of Port Jackson,\r\nthere were five hundred and fifty souls, about seventy of whom\r\nwere free. At the settlements of the Derwent and Port Dalrymple,\r\nthere were in all three thousand one hundred and fourteen souls,\r\nof whom two thousand five hundred and fifty-four were at the\r\nformer place, and five hundred and sixty at the latter: out of\r\nthese there were about two hundred soldiers, but the number of\r\nfree persons I have not been able precisely to discover. As these\r\nsettlements, however, include the majority of the colonists and\r\ntheir families, who were removed from Norfolk Island; and as by\r\nfar the greater proportion of the convicts who have been\r\ntransported from this country have been sent to Port Jackson, I\r\nhave no doubt that the number of free persons there, may be\r\nsafely estimated at three fourths of their entire population,\r\nseeing that it is about two thirds of the population of Port\r\nJackson. According to this rate of computation, therefore, the\r\nnumber of free persons in these two settlements, after previously\r\ndeducting the two hundred military, will amount to about two\r\nthousand one hundred and eighty-six souls. It may, consequently,\r\nbe perceived, that the grand total of the free population of all\r\nthese various colonies in the latter end of November, 1817, may\r\nbe safely estimated to have been eleven thousand nine hundred and\r\nseventy-three, being an excess of four thousand four hundred and\r\nseventy above the number of convicts, or in the proportion of\r\nmore than three to two.\r\n\r\nAs the establishment of the legislative assembly in question\r\ncould not, however, be well effected before the end of the year\r\n1819, it may not be altogether irrelevant to ascertain what will\r\nbe the probable amount of the free population at that period. The\r\nnumber of births in the colony cannot at present be computed\r\nunder two thousand annually, since the increase in these various\r\nsettlements between the month of November, 1816, and the month of\r\nNovember, 1817, is found to have been three thousand two hundred\r\nand eighty-nine souls; and the number of convicts transported\r\nthither from the first of January, 1816, to the first of January,\r\n1818, was only three thousand one hundred and eight. Allowing,\r\ntherefore, that one half of these, or one thousand five hundred\r\nand fifty-four, were transported to the colony during the year\r\n1817, the increase that took place there, from birth and\r\nemigration will have been one thousand seven hundred and\r\nthirty-five: to which if we add five hundred, the number of\r\npersons that probably quit the colony annually; the actual rate\r\nof increase in the free population in the course of the year\r\n1817, may be fixed at two thousand two hundred and thirty-five\r\nsouls. Of these the surplus above two thousand, is perhaps\r\ncomposed of emigrants, and the remainder of births. If we add to\r\nthese one thousand more, who it may be safely calculated yearly\r\nbecome free, by pardon or expiration of servitude, we have an\r\nannual augmentation to the free population of three thousand two\r\nhundred and thirty-five souls: so that if we take the year 1817,\r\nas a standard of computation, and it is evidently a low one, the\r\nfree population will amount by the end of the year 1819, to at\r\nleast eighteen thousand four hundred and forty-three souls. This\r\nis an elective body much more extensive than is to be found in\r\nseveral of our West India islands, where houses of assembly have\r\nbeen long established. But as this free population is of a mixed\r\ndescription, and composed as well of persons who have been\r\nconvicts, and have become free either by the expiration of their\r\nrespective sentences, or by pardon, as of those who have been\r\nborn in the colony, or have emigrated to it, and have never\r\nsuffered the penalties of the law, a very delicate question here\r\narises as to the propriety of extending to the first of these\r\nclasses the privilege of being admitted into the legislative\r\nbody. There is, I am aware, a party in the colony, by whom the\r\nvery notion of granting such a privilege to a class of men who\r\nhave been subject to the lash of the law, would be treated as a\r\nchimera pregnant with the most fatal consequences to this infant\r\ncommunity. In this, as in most other societies, there is an\r\naristocratic body, which would monopolize all situations of\r\npower, dignity and emolument, and put themselves in a posture to\r\ndomineer alike over the governor and the people. If you consult\r\none of this faction (they deserve no milder appellation) he will\r\ntell you that it is dangerous to vest any authority beyond the\r\nnarrow circle of his own immediate friends. Until the\r\nadministration of General Macquarie, this body considered\r\nthemselves possessed of an equal right to the governor's\r\nconfidence, as if they stood in the same relation to him which\r\nthe nobility of this country bear to the king, and were _de\r\njure_ his hereditary counsellors. Before his government the\r\ngreat body of the people. I mean such as had become free,\r\nscarcely possessed any privilege but that of suing and being sued\r\nin the courts of civil jurisdiction. The whole power, and nearly\r\nthe whole property and commerce of the colony, were in the hands\r\nof this faction, who with a very few exceptions were composed of\r\nthe civil and military, and of persons who had belonged to these\r\nbodies formerly. And even in those few solitary instances which\r\ncould be adduced, of persons originally convicts, who were\r\n_allowed_ to acquire an independence, their prosperity was\r\nto be traced to the patronage and protection afforded them by\r\nsome member of the aristocratic junta, to whom they either acted\r\nas agents in the disposal of their merchandize (for it was\r\nconsidered by these gentlemen derogatory to their dignity to keep\r\nshop and sell openly) or resorted for the purchase of goods on\r\ntheir own accounts. At the prosperity, however, and importance of\r\nthis faction, the present governor has levelled many a deadly\r\nblow within these last nine years; but more particularly in\r\nprohibiting the military to hold lands, or to be concerned in\r\ntraffic, in raising to situations of the highest trust and\r\ndignity many deserving persons who had been convicts, and in\r\nthrowing open the ports of the colony to an unlimited importation\r\nof all sorts of merchandize. But he has not effected these\r\nradical and salutary changes in the colonial policy without\r\nhaving encountered a long and inveterate hostility. Many have\r\nbeen the attempts which this faction have made to vilify his\r\nmotives and misrepresent his actions; but to every charge of his\r\nenemies his unshaken integrity and unwearied zeal for the\r\nconscientious discharge of his duties have proved a sufficient\r\nrefutation. The opinion of this gentleman with respect to the\r\nexpediency of adopting a liberal system, that may prove an\r\neffectual stimulus to reformation and good conduct in those who\r\nhave unhappily deviated from the path of rectitude, has been\r\nexpressed unequivocally both in his dispatches, and in the\r\nprominent measures of his government, and will deservedly carry\r\nwith it more weight than the whole collected opposition which I\r\nanticipate from those who have been his opponents and\r\ncalumniators. The covert aim of these men is to convert the\r\nignominy of the great body of the people into an hereditary\r\ndeformity. They would hand it down from father to son, and raise\r\nan eternal barrier of separation between their offspring, and the\r\noffspring of the unfortunate convict. They would establish\r\ndistinctions which may serve hereafter to divide the colonists\r\ninto _castes_; and although none among them dares publicly\r\navow that future generations should be punished for the crimes of\r\ntheir progenitors, yet such are their private sentiments; and\r\nthey would have the present race branded with disqualifications,\r\nnot more for the sake of pampering their own vanity, than with a\r\nview to reflect disgrace on the offspring of the disfranchised\r\nparent, and thus cast on their own children and descendants that\r\nfuture splendor and importance, which they consider to be their\r\npresent peculiar and distinguishing characteristics. Short-sighted\r\nfools! they foresee not the consequences of their narrow\r\nmachinations! They know not that they would be sowing the seeds\r\nof future discords and commotions, and that by exalting their\r\nimmediate descendants, they would occasion the eventual\r\ndegradation and overthrow of their posterity. Such would be the\r\nresult of their ambition; for it is the curse of injustice that\r\nit brings with it sooner or later its own punishment. Happily for\r\nthe colony the realization of their projects depends not upon\r\nthemselves; and his Majesty's ministers will not lend their\r\nsanction to schemes of private aggrandizement, which can only be\r\naccomplished by the sacrifice of the public good. If these men\r\nhave not themselves the sagacity to dive into futurity, and to\r\nforesee the dangers and contests to which unjust privileges and\r\ndistinctions must eventually give birth, shall the government be\r\nequally blind and improvident? Shall they in the short space of\r\nthirty years forget the benevolent designs for which this colony\r\nwas founded, and convert what was intended as an asylum for\r\nrepentant vice, not into a house merely of salutary correction,\r\nwhich may moderate with reviving morality and cease entirely with\r\ncomplete reformation, but into a prison of endless torture, where\r\nthough the sufferings of the body may terminate, the worst\r\nspecies of torture, the endurements and mortifications of the\r\nsoul, are to end only with existence? Shall a vile faction be\r\nallowed to inflict on the unfortunate convict a punishment\r\ninfinitely greater than that to which he has been sentenced by\r\nthe violated majesty of the law? Has not a jury of impartial\r\nfreemen solemnly investigated the case of every individual who\r\nhas been transported to this colony? And have not the measure and\r\nduration of their punishments been apportioned to their\r\nrespective offences? Is it then for any body of men to assert\r\nthat the law has been too lenient, and that it is necessary to\r\ninflict an ulterior punishment which shall have no termination\r\nbut in the grave? Shall the unhappy culprit, exiled from his\r\nnative shore, and severed perhaps for ever from the friends of\r\nhis youth, the objects of his first and best affections, after\r\nyears of suffering and atonement, still find no resting\r\nplace,--no spot where he may hide his shame and endeavour to\r\nforget his errors? Shall the finger of scorn and derision be\r\npointed at him wherever he betake himself? And must he for ever\r\nwander a recreant and outcast on the face of the earth, seeking\r\nin vain some friendly shore, where he may at length be freed from\r\nignominious disabilities, and restored to the long lost enjoyment\r\nof equal rights and equal protection with his fellows?\r\n\r\nI am aware it may be here urged that these men, if they were\r\nto return to this country, could never enjoy the privileges for\r\nwhich I am contending; and that the very same laws, which have\r\nfixed the bounds of their corporal punishment have deprived them\r\nfor ever of the most valuable rights of citizens. To this I\r\nreply, that in this country, whither if the whole of the convicts\r\nwho have been exiled from its shores were to return, they would\r\nform but an inconsiderable portion of the people, all such\r\ndisqualifications as the law has annexed to conviction in a court\r\nof justice, are good policy; because they tend to promote virtue\r\nand discountenance vice. But the very same grounds of policy\r\nrequire that such disqualifications should not exist in New South\r\nWales. There the great mass of the people are composed of persons\r\nwho have been under the operation of the law, and who were\r\ntransported with the avowed intention of the legislature to\r\neffect their reformation. How then is this great philanthropic\r\nend to be best attained? Is it by holding out no inducements to\r\ngood conduct, no distinction between repentant vice and\r\nincorrigible enormity? Those who have been convicted of the\r\nhigher order of offences, and have been in consequence\r\ntransported for life, are from the very nature of their sentences\r\nprecluded from ever enjoying the privilege in question, unless,\r\nindeed, their very exemplary conduct subsequently induce the\r\ngovernor to extend to them the benefit of the king's pardon.\r\nThis, however, is an indulgence at present so rarely accorded,\r\nthat the whole of this class may be in a manner considered as\r\nbeing without the pale of citizenship; and it is therefore such\r\nonly as have been convicted of crimes to which the law has\r\nannexed the minor penalties of seven or fourteen years\r\ntransportation, who could generally become candidates for a seat\r\nin the legislative assembly? How many of this description have\r\nbeen detected in their first offence, in their very offset in the\r\ncareer of criminality? How many ever afterwards deplore their\r\nerrors in sackcloth and ashes, and conduct themselves in the most\r\ncorrect and unexceptionable manner? And shall no distinction be\r\nmade between _them_ and the still persevering offender whom\r\nno inducements can withhold, no punishments deter from the\r\ncommission of fresh enormities? Shall the _novice_ in crime\r\nand the _veteran_ be placed on the same footing and held in\r\nequal estimation? To what end do they profess themselves to be\r\nChristians who can maintain such infernal doctrines? How can they\r\nreconcile them with that universal charity and good will\r\ninculcated in their religion? How can they themselves expect\r\npardon of their God, who would thus withhold oblivion from their\r\nrepentant fellow creatures? If it be then alike conformable to\r\nthe principles of Christianity and sound policy, to make a\r\ndiscrimination between the reformed sinner, and the still\r\nhardened and abandoned profligate, what incentive to good conduct\r\nwould prove so efficacious as the prospect of regaining, after\r\nyears of unimpeachable integrity, all those civil rights which\r\nthey had forfeited, of becoming once more privileged to act as\r\njurymen, magistrates, and legislators? Such a possibility would\r\nquickly revive the latent sparks of virtue wherever they were not\r\nquite extinct, and electrify the mind when all other applications\r\nwould fail to rouse it from its despondence and lethargy. And\r\nshall not this _sole efficacious remedy_ be administered,\r\nbecause a set of _interlopers_, persons in no wise connected\r\nwith the purposes for which this colony was founded, wish to\r\nmonopolize all the respectable offices of the government, all the\r\nfunctions of emolument, power, and dignity to themselves? Shall\r\nthe vital interests of the whole community sink before the\r\nambitious projects of a few designing individuals, who have no\r\nobject in view, but their own personal aggrandizement, and the\r\nmaintenance of a self-assumed aristocratic importance? And who\r\nwould build their own and their families' prosperity on the ruins\r\nof the social edifice, on the misery and degradation of\r\nthousands? But it is useless to enlarge on this topic: ministers\r\nwill not allow their judgments to be warped by the subtle\r\nrepresentations of this faction. In organizing that new\r\nconstitution for this colony, of which every motive of humanity\r\nand policy conspires to demonstrate the necessity, they will be\r\nactuated solely by those principles that are best calculated to\r\nfurther the philanthropic and enlightened ends which were\r\ncontemplated by the legislature at the period of its foundation.\r\nThe good of the many will not be sacrificed to the sordid views\r\nof the few, and no disqualifications will be permitted, but such\r\nas are confessedly necessary for the repression of vice, and the\r\npromotion of morality and religion.\r\n\r\nBut, while I am thus contending against the total exclusion of\r\nsuch as may have been convicts from the enjoyment of this great\r\nprivilege, I would by no means imply that the doors of the\r\nlegislative assembly should be thrown open to _all\r\nindiscriminately_ who may _happen_ to be _free_. An\r\nunrestricted ability to exercise a function of such great\r\nconfidence and dignity, would superinduce consequences equally\r\nfatal with those against which I would guard: in endeavouring to\r\nshun one extreme, it behoves us equally to avoid falling into the\r\nother. The very principle which _forbids_ their _utter\r\ninadmissibility_ to become legislators, demands that\r\n_none_ should be able to arrive at that dignity, but those\r\nwhose conduct during their abode in the colony shall have been\r\n_absolutely unimpeachable_. Retrospection should not be\r\npushed _beyond_ the period of their _arrival;_ but\r\ntheir _subsequent_ behaviour should be subjected to the\r\n_severest tests_, to the _most rigorous scrutiny_.\r\n_Conviction_ either before a court or a magistrate, for any\r\n_offence_ of a _criminal nature_, should be a\r\n_bar_ to their pretensions _for ever_. Crimes committed\r\nin this country should be overlooked when followed by\r\n_adequate_ atonement and _indubitable_ reformation; but\r\nthe _interests_ as well of the _rising generation_, as\r\nof the _great body_ of the _convicts themselves_,\r\nrequire that the _re-convicted_ felon, whom neither the\r\n_hope_ of _distinction_ can _reclaim_, nor the\r\n_fear_ of _punishment deter_ from a recurrence to his\r\nold iniquities, should be branded with the _lasting\r\nimpressions_ of _infamy_, and rendered for _ever\r\nafterwards incapable_ of exercising so respectable and\r\nimportant a function as the one in question.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the nature and extent of the property to be\r\npossessed by the members of the legislative assembly, I am of\r\nopinion, that a freehold estate of five hundred acres in any part\r\nof the territory of New South Wales, or its dependent settlements\r\non Van Diemen's Land, should be considered a sufficient\r\nqualification, and that in the case of electors twenty acres of\r\nfreehold should give the right of voting at elections for the\r\ndistricts in which such freehold property may be situated; and\r\nthat either a leasehold of the value of £5 a year, or\r\npaying a house rent of £10 a year, that of voting at\r\nelections for towns. Excepting conviction, therefore, in this\r\ncountry as a ground of exclusion both as respects the candidates\r\nand the constituents, and making the above variation in the\r\nstandard of their respective qualifications as to property, I\r\nthink that every cause of rejection which is deemed in Canada of\r\nsufficient efficacy to invalidate the claims of either party,\r\nshould be held of equal force in this colony, not only with\r\npersons who may have been convicts, but with all such as may wish\r\neither to vote for the return of members, or to become members of\r\nthe legislative body themselves. In framing, indeed, a\r\nconstitution for the colony, that of Canada would, I suspect, be\r\nupon the whole the best model for imitation; since there is not\r\nonly a much stronger affinity between the great body of its\r\ninhabitants, and those of New South Wales, than exists in any of\r\nour other colonies; but every succeeding year will render the\r\napproximation of their character and pursuits still more\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\nThere is but one topic more connected with the establishment\r\nof a house of assembly in this colony, on which I intend to\r\ncomment; and I notice it not so much with a view to offer fresh\r\narguments in support of the necessity of this measure, which I\r\nconsider I have already sufficiently demonstrated, as to state\r\nall the prominent reasons which might be adduced on the occasion.\r\nIt is a fundamental maxim of the British constitution, that no\r\ntaxes shall be levied on the subject without his consent\r\nexpressed by his representatives, and yet duties have been\r\nexacted in this colony for the last fifteen years, by the mere\r\nauthority of the various governors. These, it has been seen, are\r\nappropriated to various purposes of internal economy, all of\r\ngreat public importance and utility, to which it is but equitable\r\nthat the colonists should contribute. This system of taxation\r\noriginated, I believe, with Governor King, but whether with the\r\nsanction of his Majesty's ministers, or from his own suggestion I\r\nam not able to determine. Since his time I should imagine that\r\nnot less than two hundred thousand pounds have been levied in\r\nthis unconstitutional manner; and until the administration of the\r\npresent governor, those who paid this money had not even the\r\nsatisfaction of knowing how any part of it was applied. From the\r\nsecrecy indeed which was observed in the expenditure of this\r\nfund, and the rapacious character of his predecessor, many of the\r\ncolonists suspected that very little of it was appropriated\r\nduring his time to the purposes for which it was intended. This\r\nmisapplication of it, however, is but a matter of conjecture; and\r\nit was probably to shelter himself from the possibility of\r\nfalling under a similar imputation, that the present governor has\r\ncaused quarterly accounts, which are first verified by a\r\ncommittee consisting of the lieutenant governor and the judge\r\nadvocate, and afterwards examined and approved by himself, to be\r\npublished for the general information. This custom, however, is a\r\ndeviation, although it must be confessed a good one, from\r\nprecedent: and the colonists have no guarantee that his\r\nsuccessors will not revert to the same mysterious application of\r\nthis fund that has been practised by his predecessors. In this\r\ncase it may be converted into a fruitful source of peculation and\r\nplunder, and be at last in a great measure diverted from the\r\npublic objects for which it was instituted to the satiation of\r\nprivate rapacity, and the colonists become gradually burdened\r\nwith an overbearing load of taxation, merely for the purpose of\r\nenriching their governors. Be this, however, as it may, the\r\nillegality of levying money by the authority of any individual,\r\nis, I should presume, quite unquestionable; and I have no doubt\r\nthat if any of the colonists had public spirit enough to resist\r\nthe payment of these duties, the court of civil jurisdiction\r\nwould not enforce it; since the decisions of this court are\r\nsolely founded on acts of parliament. The magistrates of the\r\ncolony might indeed take upon themselves to direct the execution\r\nof the governor's orders, which authorize the levying of these\r\ntaxes, but I have doubts, since resistance to these orders would\r\nnot amount to an act of a criminal nature, and the point at issue\r\nwould be a mere matter of debt between an individual and the\r\ngovernment, whether they even would consent to give such an\r\nillegal method of taxation the sanction of their support. At all\r\nevents an appeal would lie in the shape of a writ of certiorari\r\nto the civil court, which could not avoid annulling the judgment\r\nof the magistrates, and consequently declaring the governor's\r\nconduct unwarranted and illegal. Such an occurrence would\r\nevidently be attended with the most prejudicial effects; for not\r\nto dwell on the mortification which the governor for the time\r\nbeing would experience at discovering in so disagreeable a way\r\nthat by treading in the footsteps of his predecessors, he had\r\nbeen exercising a power to which his situation gave him no claim,\r\nthere can be little doubt that a victory of this nature gained by\r\nan individual over the executive would be the signal for the\r\ninstitution of suits against the government for the recovery of\r\nall the money that has been levied under such an illegal and\r\narbitrary authority. To prevent the probability of being forced\r\nto refund so large a sum of money to the persons or their heirs\r\nfrom whom it has been thus illegally wrested, and to legalize all\r\nfuture levies of duties in the colony, the establishment of a\r\ncolonial legislature certainly offers the only judicious and\r\nconstitutional expedient.\r\n\r\nI would not that it should be considered from the foregoing\r\nremarks that the colonists are averse to taxation. On the\r\ncontrary, it is my belief that they would cheerfully contribute\r\nwhatever may be necessary for the promotion of objects _purely\r\ncolonial_; but they expect, and have a right to do so, that\r\nall such objects should be submitted to the consideration and\r\napproval of their representatives, and that their money should\r\nnot be taken out of their pockets, whether they will or not, by\r\nthe mere _ipse dixit_ of a governor. Few are discontented\r\nwith the present rate of taxation, because it is moderate; and,\r\nwith the exception of that small part of the colonial revenue\r\nwhich arises from duties on articles of export, may be even\r\nconsidered judicious; inasmuch as the great bulk of the duties\r\nfalls on luxuries which can be dispensed with, without\r\noccasioning any material diminution of comfort and enjoyment. But\r\nall are averse to the manner in which these duties are levied;\r\nfor if they once admit that a governor has the right to exact one\r\nfarthing by his single authority, what limits can be afterwards\r\nassigned to the exercise of this power? He may on the very same\r\nprinciple tax every article of consumption, and on the plea of\r\npublic contributions undermine the whole prosperity and happiness\r\nof the community. That the different governors have been allowed\r\nto prosecute this system without opposition for so many years,\r\ncould only have arisen from the peculiar constitution of this\r\ncolony; but its population has now attained a degree of\r\nconsequence and respectability, which will not much longer tamely\r\npermit such an unprecedented deviation from all constitutional\r\nauthority; and the best way to obviate the unpleasant\r\ncircumstances of the contest, to which a continuance of the\r\npresent system must shortly give rise, is to create a body\r\nlegally endowed with the powers of legislation.\r\n\r\nOn the expediency of appointing a council, his Majesty's\r\nministers are, I believe, themselves agreed; and I will not,\r\ntherefore, enter at great length on the subject. The arbitrary\r\nand revolting acts, which the want of a controlling body of this\r\nnature has already occasioned, furnish the most convincing proof\r\nof its necessity. No power, in fact, could be established, which\r\nwould at one and the same time prove so firm a defence to the\r\nsubject, and so stable a support to the executive. A council in\r\nthe colonies bears many points of resemblance to the House of\r\nLords in this country. It forms that just equipoise between the\r\ndemocratic and supreme powers of the state, which has been found\r\nnot less necessary to repress the licentiousness of the one, than\r\nto curb the tyranny of the other. Besides, it at all times\r\nprovides a remedy for the inexperience or ignorance of governors;\r\nand is a sort of nucleus, round which all new bodies may easily\r\nagglomerate. Like a handful of veterans in a newly raised\r\nregiment, it will be capable of setting in motion the whole\r\nmachinery of the government, and establishing with the greatest\r\ncelerity that organization and discipline which are as requisite\r\nin administration as in war. There is but one precaution to be\r\nobserved in the formation of the council: it is to give the\r\nmembers of it an adequate salary, or in other words to insure the\r\nindependent and conscientious discharge of the duties of their\r\nhighly important office.\r\n\r\nThe expediency of appointing a colonial secretary rests in a\r\ngreat measure on the same grounds as that of creating a council.\r\nHow can a private secretary, whom every new governor is at\r\npresent under the necessity of bringing out with him, be capable\r\nof entering at once upon the duties of the most complicated and\r\nlaborious office in the colony? It is evident that a considerable\r\ntime must unavoidably elapse, before he can acquire, how great\r\nsoever his abilities, that fund of local information which can\r\nalone qualify him for his situation. In the mean while it is ten\r\nto one but he becomes the tool of one or other of his clerks, who\r\nare for the most part convicts; and thus the principal acts of\r\nthe governor, which from the confidential nature of his office\r\nare necessarily very materially influenced by his advice, may be\r\nsecretly dictated by persons who possess very little principle or\r\ncharacter, and who if they be themselves too insignificant to\r\nprofit to an extensive degree by the measures of the government,\r\nmay for a trifling consideration become the agents of richer and\r\nmore powerful individuals, and the public good be inadvertently\r\nsacrificed at the shrine of private avarice or ambition.\r\n\r\nThe last measure which I consider necessary to the prosperity\r\nof this colony is a radical reform in the courts of justice. It\r\nhas long since been noticed that at the principal settlement and\r\nits dependencies, there are five courts, one of criminal and the\r\nother four of civil judicature, viz. the criminal court, the\r\ngovernor's court, the supreme court, the court of vice admiralty,\r\nthe high court of appeals, all of which are held in Sydney, and\r\nthe lieutenant governor's court, which is held in Hobart Town.\r\nThe constitution of these various courts has been already\r\nexplained, and a mere cursory glance at their several\r\njurisdictions, will convince us of the danger and absurdity of\r\ntheir organization. To commence in the order in which I have\r\nnoticed them, what can be more improper than the constitution of\r\nthe criminal court? At the time indeed, when this court was\r\ninstituted, there was a necessity that it should wholly consist\r\nof the officers of the colony, since they and convicts were the\r\nonly two classes of whom it was composed; but even then, what\r\nmotive existed for excluding the civil officers? Were they either\r\nless competent to be members of a court, whose decisions ought to\r\nbe founded solely on the laws of England, or were they less\r\nrespectable than the military and naval? The bare appearance of\r\nthis tribunal has long been odious and revolting to the majority\r\nof the colonists. It is disgusting to an Englishman to see a\r\nculprit, however heinous may be his offence, arraigned before a\r\ncourt clad in full military costume; nor can it indeed be readily\r\nconceived that a body of men, whose principles and habits must\r\nhave been materially influenced, if not entirely formed, by a\r\ncode altogether foreign to the laws of this country, should be\r\nable on such occasions to divest themselves of the soldier, and\r\nto judge as the citizen. Without meaning to impugn the general\r\nimpartiality and justice of their decisions, it may be easily\r\nimagined that _an individual might happen_ to be\r\n_traduced_ before a court, of which _all_, or\r\n_part_ of the members, might from various causes be\r\n_his_ enemies. No one has mixed much in military society,\r\nwithout witnessing that _esprit du corps_ which is so common\r\nin regiments, and which, however much it may contribute to their\r\nunion and happiness, is, in a community of this nature, of the\r\nmost dangerous tendency to the individual, against whom its\r\ncollected fury may be levelled. It must be remembered that this\r\ncolony is not like a country town from whence a regiment may be\r\nremoved the moment its conduct becomes obnoxious to the\r\ninhabitants. There the regiments necessarily remain for many\r\nyears, and from this very circumstance, disputes of a much more\r\nserious and rancorous nature are apt to arise between the\r\ninhabitants and the military, than are known in this country. And\r\nthis observation applies more particularly to the officers and\r\nthe superior class of the colonists: since the disputes and\r\ncontests which take place between the lower orders of the\r\ninhabitants and the common soldiery, generally arise on the spur\r\nof the moment, and evaporate with the immediate cause of the\r\nprovocation; while the others are more frequently the effect of\r\ncool and deliberate insult, and consequently settle into a fixed\r\nand inveterate hostility. Under these circumstances, therefore,\r\nit is not to be wondered at, that no person should feel himself\r\nin perfect security. The respectability of the higher order of\r\nthe colonists may indeed shield the generality of them from any\r\nlikelihood of their being ever arraigned before this tribunal;\r\nbut still it might happen to them to be traduced before a court\r\ncomposed of their bitterest foes, not only on charges of a mixed\r\nnature, such as assault, battery, libel, etc. but also on others\r\nof a much weightier responsibility. The _probability_ of\r\nsuch a contingency would be still further increased if the\r\ngovernor should happen to have imbibed the same spirit of\r\nhostility against the accused, which I have supposed actuating\r\nthe military. For although the present governor, in order to\r\nrender the administration of justice as unimpeachable as the\r\nnature of this court will allow, has invariably appointed the\r\nmembers of it according to the roaster furnished by the\r\ncommanding officer of the regiment, his predecessors did not, I\r\nbelieve, invariably observe the same delicacy, nor is it\r\nincumbent on his successors to imitate his example. Any person\r\ntherefore, who may unfortunately become obnoxious to the governor\r\nand the officers of the regiment, or indeed any part of them,\r\nshould he be accused of any offence within the pale of the\r\ncriminal court, might be thus forced to take his trial before his\r\n_selected_ and _implacable_ enemies. In this extremity\r\nwhat could he do to rescue himself from their gripe? He would\r\nhave no _right_ to _challenge one_ of them; and if the\r\n_sanctity_ of an _oath_, and the _dread_ of the\r\n_future scorn_ and _detestation_ of mankind, did not\r\n_deter_ them from the _commission_ of a _crying_\r\nand _palpable injustice_, his _innocence_, were it as\r\n_clear_ as the _noon day_, would _avail_ him\r\n_nothing_, and he must _unavoidbly sink_, the\r\n_devoted victim_ of _foul conspiracy and deadly\r\nrevenge_. I am not sufficiently acquainted with the history of\r\nthe proceedings of this court from the period of its institution,\r\nto shew how far the _whole_ or any _part_ of this\r\nsupposed case may have been in any instance verified. That it\r\n_may occur_ is sufficient to _prove_ the\r\n_necessity_ for changing the constitution of this court, and\r\nto _justify_ the _general anxiety_ which is felt by the\r\ncolonists for the introduction of that _right_, so dear to\r\nthe heart of every Englishman, _the trial by jury_. It is\r\nthis _inestimable privilege alone_ which can _insure_\r\nthem the _tranquil enjoyment_ of their _persons_ and\r\n_property_, and enable them, while _possessed_ of\r\n_conscious integrity of conduct_, to set at _defiance_\r\nthe _confederated efforts_ of their _enemies_, and to\r\n_despise_ both the _open attacks_ of _power_ and\r\nthe _secret contrivances of malignity_.\r\n\r\nThe constitution of the governor's court and of the supreme\r\ncourt, is liable to the same objection. They are both composed of\r\nthe judges, who have each a vote in their respective courts, and\r\nof two members specially appointed by the governor: so that none\r\nof those causes of challenge which are held sufficient in this\r\ncountry to disqualify a juror, are of any validity in the courts\r\nof this colony. In the governor's court, indeed, the two members\r\nare to be appointed from among the respectable inhabitants; but,\r\nalthough the governor himself is the only judge of the measure of\r\ntheir respectability, he could not well avoid selecting them out\r\nof that class which in case of the introduction of trial by jury,\r\nwould have a right from their property and character to be\r\nsummoned as jurymen. In this court, therefore, an individual in a\r\ntrial with the crown, would have a much greater chance of\r\nobtaining justice than in the supreme court; because the two\r\nmembers of it are to be appointed from the magistracy, and might\r\nbe selected by the governor from their known zeal and corrupt\r\ndevotedness to his service. But it is of infinitely greater\r\nimportance that the decisions of this latter court should be the\r\nless exposed of the two to the possibility of bias; because in\r\nthe former the injury which an individual could sustain from an\r\nunjust verdict could only amount to £50, and in the latter\r\nit might extend to £3000, and consequently occasion his\r\nutter ruin. I limit the injustice which might arise from the very\r\nimproper constitution of this court to the above sum; because,\r\nalthough it is competent, as I have before stated, to take\r\ncognizance of all pleas to any amount whatever, an appeal would\r\nlie, from the high court of appeals, whose verdict I here take it\r\nfor granted, would in all crown causes be confirmatory of the\r\njudgment of the inferior court, to the king in council, when the\r\nmatter in dispute exceeded this sum. Any unjust verdict,\r\ntherefore, for more than £3000, would of course be reversed\r\nin this country; but this is a trifling set-off against the heavy\r\ncharges to which the court is in other respects liable; since few\r\nof the colonists are wealthy enough to be concerned in causes\r\nwhere the matter at issue could attain so great an amount: so\r\nthat this remedy is quite beyond the reach of the majority of the\r\ninhabitants, and they are abandoned to the scourge of oppression,\r\nwherever a capricious and overwhelming tyranny may choose to\r\nsingle out its victim. It is highly necessary, therefore, that\r\nthe constitution of both these courts should undergo an immediate\r\nrevision, and be so framed as to ensure henceforth the impartial\r\nadministration of justice to _all_. They are not to be\r\ntolerated because they cannot commit a robbery beyond this\r\nenormous amount, and because there are some few individuals,\r\nwhose prosperity is too deeply rooted to be overturned by the\r\nmalignant fury of vengeful despots. It must be evident that the\r\npower of the governor of this colony is sufficiently leviathan,\r\nuncontrolled as he is by a council, and possessed as he is of an\r\nincontrovertible right to nominate the most obsequious of his\r\ncreatures as jurymen on all trials, whether of a civil or\r\ncriminal nature, to endanger the property and life of every\r\nindividual under his government. Nor should it here be forgotten\r\nthat there has been a governor who, if the colonists had not\r\narrested him in his iniquitous career of vengeance and despotism,\r\nwould have hurled death and destruction from one end of the\r\ncolony to the other. Without the circle of his immediate\r\ncreatures, with the most favored of whom it is well known that he\r\nwas in a commercial partnership, every individual who either had\r\nattained affluence, or was gradually rising to it, was the object\r\nof his hatred or envy. The former he detested, not more because\r\nthey had no need of his protection, than from fear they should\r\npromulgate to the world his nefarious proceedings; the latter\r\nbecause they were absorbing some portion of that wealth, which he\r\nwished should flow wholly into the coffers, the contents of which\r\nat the division of the spoil he was to have so large a share of.\r\nIt does not follow, therefore, because his successor has not\r\nimitated his base example, because he has surrounded himself with\r\nrespectable counsellors and a conscientious magistracy, that we\r\nshould overlook the possibility that his very successor may\r\nundermine the whole superstructure which he has been rearing, and\r\nbecome in every respect as great a monster as the wretch who\r\nbefore drove the colonists to desperation and rebellion.\r\nExperience is the beacon of past times set up for the guidance of\r\nfuture; and those who shape their course by it, shall avoid\r\nstriking on the rocks to which it forbids approach. Woe to the\r\npilot who disregards this friendly admonition, and runs on\r\nincredulous of the risk. Soon in the midst of surrounding reefs\r\nhe shall when too late repent his temerity, and wish, that\r\ncontent with the experience of others he had not authenticated by\r\nthe shipwreck of his hopes, the folly of his incredulity, and the\r\nreality of the danger! It is with governments as with\r\nindividuals. The institutions which have occasioned anarchy and\r\ndevastation before, will, if persisted in, produce them again.\r\nVile and detestable as have been the monsters of antiquity, the\r\nworld still contains their parallels; and if they languish in\r\nobscurity, if they have not attained a celebrity equally\r\natrocious, it is because they possess not equal facilities for\r\nthe display of their real character and propensities. Human\r\nnature is still the same, and wherever a field is opened for the\r\ngrowth of tyranny, there that poisonous fungus, a tyrant, will\r\nshoot up.\r\n\r\nBut the encouragement which these courts in general hold out\r\nfor the indulgence of private animosities, and their consequently\r\nimperfect adaptation to the administration of justice, are not\r\nthe only reasons which may be urged for a change in their present\r\norganization. The whole of the inhabitants of the various\r\nsettlements in Van Diemen's Land, are in a great measure placed\r\nwithout the pale of the law. They have, indeed, what is termed\r\nthe lieutenant governor's court, but as I have already observed,\r\nit can only take cognizance of pleas to the amount of fifty\r\npounds, and possesses no criminal jurisdiction whatever. They are\r\nconsequently left without any internal protection from the\r\nspoliations of lawless ruffians, and in a great measure from the\r\nscarcelyless pernicious depredations of dishonest creditors. For\r\nalthough they may obtain redress in both instances in the courts\r\nestablished at Port Jackson, nothing but an invincible necessity\r\nwill propel them to seek so distant and expensive a remedy. The\r\nconsequence is, that scarcely any but delinquents of the very\r\nworst cast, as murderers and housebreakers, are ever brought to\r\ntrial; for notwithstanding all criminal prosecutions are\r\nconducted at the cost of the government, and the witnesses are\r\npaid their indispensable expenses from the police fund, still,\r\nwhat with the period that elapses in the voyage to Port Jackson,\r\nthe delays incident to the courts themselves, and the time that\r\nthe witnesses must generally wait before they can obtain a\r\npassage back again, very few of the persons who are constrained\r\nto give evidence on such occasions can possibly manage to resume\r\ntheir domestic occupations under three months. This to a set of\r\nmen, who are for the most part agriculturists, is too serious a\r\nsacrifice of private advantage to public duty; and it is not,\r\ntherefore, to be wondered at that a general disposition should be\r\nmanifested by the inhabitants of Van Diemen's Land to suffer\r\nquietly the depredations that may be committed on their property,\r\nrather than incur perhaps the much greater loss attached to the\r\nprosecution of the offender. The remedy, which they possess for\r\ncivil injuries is, indeed, somewhat more palatable, but still far\r\ntoo remote and expensive. The principal reason, indeed, why so\r\nmany debts and obligations contracted in these settlements,\r\nbecome matter of action before the supreme court at Port Jackson,\r\nis to be traced to the satisfaction which results from compelling\r\none who considers himself a privileged plunderer, and at liberty\r\nto fatten with impunity on the industrious, to disgorge the\r\nwealth of others, which he may have thus sucked. The expence,\r\nhowever, of supporting witnesses at so great a distance from\r\ntheir homes, and the precarious issue of suits in general, induce\r\nmany creditors to run the risk of voluntary payment at some\r\nfuture period, who would not hesitate to institute actions\r\nagainst their debtors, if there were a competent tribunal within\r\ntheir reach. The want, therefore, of a court possessing an\r\nunlimited civil and criminal jurisdiction, is of the most baneful\r\nconsequence to these infant settlements. It encourages all\r\nspecies of crimes and dishonesty, strikes at the very root of\r\nvirtue and religion, and cannot but have a most pernicious effect\r\non the morals of the rising generation.\r\n\r\nSuch are the leading defects in the actual system of\r\njurisprudence established in this colony; and I think it will not\r\nbe disputed that a more crude and undigested organization of the\r\ncolonial courts could hardly have been devised. Whether the\r\njudges of these courts have made any representations on the\r\nsubject to his Majesty's government I am not aware; but I should\r\napprehend not, or surely they would have been remodelled ere this\r\nafter a more perfect design. To effect this highly important\r\nobject would be a matter of very great ease: it appears to me\r\nthat the following measures would amply suffice. 1st, The entire\r\nabolition of the actual courts of civil and criminal\r\njurisdiction; 2dly, The creation in their stead of one supreme\r\ncourt, consisting of a chief justice and three puisne judges;\r\n3dly. The establishment of trial by jury; and lastly, the\r\ncreation of a high court of appeals to consist of the governor in\r\ncouncil. The sittings of the supreme court should only be held at\r\nSydney, the seat of government; but circuits should be\r\nestablished through-out the different districts of the colony,\r\nand of its dependent settlements in Van Diemen's Land, and\r\ncommissions of assize, of oyer and terminer, and of general gaol\r\ndelivery should be issued by the governor to the judges at stated\r\nperiods, and they should determine among themselves their\r\nrespective circuits. These courts of assize should possess the\r\nsame power as belongs to similar courts in this country, and in\r\nsome respects it might be advisable that they should be vested\r\nwith a still more extensive authority. In the settlements in Van\r\nDiemen's Land I am of opinion that no appeal should be allowed\r\nfrom the decisions of the court of assize to the supreme court at\r\nSydney, unless the verdict should exceed three hundred pounds;\r\nbut it would of course be proper that the judges of this court\r\nshould possess the power of granting new trials, on the same\r\ngrounds on _which_ such are accorded in this country. In\r\njudgments, however, for more than the above sum an appeal to the\r\nsupreme court should be admitted.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the civil jurisdiction of the courts of assize\r\nin the various districts belonging to Port Jackson, I think it\r\nought to be considerably curtailed, and that their decision\r\nshould not be final in any instance whatever; because the removal\r\nof causes to the supreme court would be attended with a\r\ncomparatively trifling expense and inconvenience to the parties.\r\nFrom the judgment of this latter court itself, I am of opinion\r\nthat an appeal should lie in all causes where the damages might\r\nbe estimated at more than one thousand pounds to the high court\r\nof appeals, and that its decisions should be conclusive in all\r\npleas under the amount of three thousand pounds; but where the\r\nmatter in dispute exceeded this sum, that an appeal should lie\r\n_en dernier resort_ to the king in council. If to these\r\ncourts were added a court of admiralty, possessing both a civil\r\nand criminal jurisdiction, the system of jurisprudence would be\r\nquite adequate to all the present necessities of the colony;\r\njustice would be brought home to the doors of all his Majesty's\r\nsubjects in these remote and extended settlements; the delay and\r\nexpence now attendant on civil and criminal prosecutions, would\r\nbe in a great measure obviated; and the loyal and industrious\r\nwould be effectually protected, both from the secret depredations\r\nof the midnight plunderer, and from the open dishonesty of the\r\nunprincipled debtor: hundreds of indolent and profligate persons\r\nwho now prey in one way or the other on the hard earned savings\r\nof thrift and frugality, would be compelled to resort to the\r\npursuits of industry for a subsistence; vice and immorality would\r\nbe checked, and the wealth, happiness, and virtue of the\r\ncommunity at large rapidly flourish and expand.\r\n\r\nOf all the changes or modifications which I have thus ventured\r\nto recommend in the polity of this colony, the creation of a\r\ncouncil, the appointment of a colonial secretary, and these\r\nalterations in the system of its jurisprudence, are the only\r\nmeasures which would be attended with an increase of expence. The\r\nestablishment of a house of assembly, might of course be effected\r\nwithout any cost whatever, and even the remodelling of the courts\r\nof justice would be productive of but a very trifling addition to\r\nthe scale of the civil establishment. The three judges who at\r\npresent preside in the various courts, might be transferred to\r\nthe supreme court, which I have recommended to be substituted in\r\ntheir stead; so that the appointment of one new judge is the\r\nprincipal additional expense of which this reorganization of the\r\ncourts would be productive. It is true that it would be necessary\r\nto place all the puisne judges on the same footing in point of\r\nsalary, and likewise to appoint an attorney general to act in\r\nbehalf of the crown, but all this might be liberally accomplished\r\nfor about six thousand pounds per annum. As to the court of\r\nadmiralty, the chief justice might be appointed to preside in it,\r\nwhenever circumstances might require it to be held; but this\r\nnecessity would occur so seldom that no additional salary need be\r\nallowed him on this account. A few barristers would be necessary\r\nbesides the attorney general, to support the respectability of\r\nthese courts; but I consider that the practice arising out of\r\nthem, would be sufficiently extensive to repay a few gentlemen of\r\nthe bar very liberally for the sacrifices they would make in\r\nemigrating to this colony, and that the government need not hold\r\nout any pecuniary inducements to effect this object; although it\r\nis only four or five years since two attornies were each allowed\r\n£300 per annum by way of encouragement for them to go out\r\nand practise in the courts at present established there. Since\r\nthat time, however, two more have voluntarily gone out to the\r\ncolony without any salary whatever, and have found that there is\r\nsufficient litigation without the assisting liberality of the\r\ngovernment. An addition therefore of £6000 per annum to the\r\ncivil establishment of this colony, would effect the great\r\nradical reformation in its polity, of which it has been the main\r\nobject of this essay to prove the wisdom and necessity; while on\r\nthe other hand, the savings which this country would derive from\r\nthe adoption of the various alterations proposed, would be found\r\nnot only in the almost immediate check which would be imposed on\r\nthe rapidly increasing expenditure of this colony, but also in\r\nthe great permanent reduction in it, which would be the eventual\r\nconsequence. The best means of accomplishing these highly\r\nimportant ends shall be the subject of the following section.\r\n\r\nOn the Means of reducing the Expences of this Colony.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of a free constitution in the place of the\r\narbitrary authority of an individual, would superinduce so many\r\nprivileges of which the colonists have hitherto been debarred,\r\nthat they would not at first be fully sensible of the nature and\r\nextent of their new acquisitions. The great facilities which\r\nwould be presented to agricultural and commercial enterprize,\r\nwould not at once be generally perceived, or extensively\r\nembraced. Industry, though one of the most active principles of\r\nhuman nature, settles when long restrained into a habit of\r\ninertion, which cannot be instantly overcome. When the mounds\r\nwithin which this principle has been long confined, are suddenly\r\nremoved, it will not of itself rush at once into every new\r\nchannel in its way, and stop only when it has found its own\r\nlevel. It is not like fluids possessed of an inherent elasticity\r\nand tendency to motion, but requires a directing impulse to set\r\nand continue it in activity, and its activity will then only be\r\nin proportion to the power and energy applied. It is not,\r\ntherefore, to be expected, because the great fundamental changes\r\nwhich I have recommended in the polity of this colony would if\r\nadopted, immediately create new sources of profitable occupation,\r\nand completely unfetter the long restrained industry and\r\nenterprize of its inhabitants, that they are at once to take full\r\nadvantage of their situation. There is a timidity in man, which\r\nthough not sufficient to curb the adventurous spirit of his\r\nnature, tends materially to check and repress it. This principle\r\nalone, therefore, would suffice to prevent the sober and discreet\r\npart of the colonists from rushing headlong into the various new\r\navenues of profitable occupation that would be open to them; but\r\nthere is also in their poverty a still more effectual impediment.\r\nThough labour is itself the origin and measure of all wealth, it\r\ncontributes but little to public or private advantage when left\r\nto its own isolated and unconnected efforts. It is only when in a\r\nstate of union, and when subjected to the controul of a directing\r\nintelligence, which can combine its energies, and render them\r\nsubservient to the attainment of some single end, that it becomes\r\ncapable of effecting great beneficial results. But this necessary\r\ncombination of labour can only be maintained by the help of\r\ncapital; and where such capital does not exist, these great\r\nunited efforts, the effect of the gradual accumulation of wealth,\r\nand the main cause of the prosperity of all ancient and populous\r\ncommunities, cannot be immediately organized and established.\r\nThis observation in its reference to this colony, it will be\r\nseen, bears more particularly on the commercial privileges of\r\nwhich its inhabitants would thus become possessed. These\r\nundoubtedly would not be extensively embraced, until a very\r\nconsiderable accumulation of capital should have arisen from the\r\nprogress and perfection of agriculture. This and manufactures are\r\ntherefore the only two immediate channels that remain for the\r\nabsorption of labour and the development of industry. The latter,\r\nI have long since endeavoured to prove would never have occupied\r\nany share of the attention of the colonists, had those\r\nencouragements which the government had at their disposal, been\r\nbestowed on the former. The manufacturing system, now so rapidly\r\ngaining ground, has been one of the retributive consequences of\r\nthe short-sighted and illiberal policy of which this unfortunate\r\ncolony has been so long the victim, and will cease of itself,\r\nwhenever the existing impediments to the extension of agriculture\r\nshall be removed, for the best of all reasons, because no person\r\nwill select a less profitable undertaking when a more profitable\r\none, and one requiring less skill, capital, and assiduity, lies\r\nopen to him. Agriculture, therefore, as soon as it shall be freed\r\nfrom its present restraints, will afford the readiest and most\r\naccessible channel for carrying off the large accumulation of\r\nstagnant labour which at present infests this colony. It is this\r\nmass of superfluous labourers, for whom there exists only a\r\nfictitious demand, and with whom the government are at present\r\nobliged to give a bounty in the shape of clothing and provisions,\r\nto induce the settlers to accept their services, that constitutes\r\nthe main source of the great and increasing expenditure of this\r\ncolony; and it is to this point alone that all radical and\r\ncomprehensive schemes of retrenchment must be directed. The\r\nimpoverished condition of the colonists, to which circumstance\r\nalone the expences of the government are mainly attributable,\r\narises from the means of employment not keeping pace with the\r\nrapid increase in the population, and yet perhaps there is no\r\ncommunity in which equal encouragements to industry are to be\r\nfound. It has already been stated that within the last six years\r\nthe population of this colony has actually doubled itself, in\r\nother words, it has advanced in this respect with a celerity\r\nnearly four times as great as the United States of America,--a\r\ncountry whose rapid numerical increase has been a subject of\r\nastonishment to the whole world. It may therefore be perceived\r\nthat this unparalleled augmentation in the population of this\r\ncolony, must of itself afford an unprecedented stimulus to\r\nagriculture;--a stimulus, perhaps, with which the agricultural\r\nprogress of any other country could not keep pace. It is well\r\nknown that Poland, which is the greatest corn country in Europe,\r\nand whose whole strength is directed to the pursuits of\r\nagriculture, does not export more than one month's consumption of\r\ngrain for its population. America exports somewhat less, but\r\nwould be able, without doubt, to export somewhat more, if the\r\ncollected force of its inhabitants were applied to the raising of\r\ncorn; yet still neither the one nor the other of these countries\r\nwould be enabled to support such a rapid increase of population\r\nas is taking place in this colony. Such, however, is its\r\nfertility that the vast encouragement afforded by this\r\nunprecedented augmentation in its numbers (who, it must be\r\nrecollected, are for the most part adults, and not, as in the\r\ncase of old established societies, infants, and in consequence\r\nnot gifted with the full powers of consumption,) so prodigious, I\r\nsay, is its fertility, that there is far from a sufficient demand\r\nfor labour. The settlements in Van Diemen's Land alone, on the\r\noccasion of the flood which took place in the month of March,\r\n1817, at the Hawkesbury river, the principal agricultural\r\nestablishment, and where, for the causes I have already\r\nexplained, the colonists, in most instances, allow their stacks\r\nto remain within the influence of these destructive inundations,\r\nwere able to supply Port Jackson with about twenty thousand\r\nbushels of wheat, the whole of which was raised without any\r\nprobability of a market, and would have perished in the hands of\r\nthe growers, or at best, have become the food of hogs, had it not\r\nbeen for the great loss of grain occasioned by the overflowing of\r\nthe above river. It may, therefore, be perceived, that the\r\ncolonists in Van Diemen's Land raise on the strength of the bare\r\npossibility of a flood happening at the principal settlement,\r\nvery nearly as much corn as is required for their own\r\nconsumption; and there can be no doubt if their industry was\r\nstretched to the utmost point of extension, that they would be\r\nenabled to export at least three times as much as they thus\r\ncasually furnished in the year 1817. The settlements, however, at\r\nPort Jackson, cannot pretend to equal fertility of soil, yet even\r\ntheir productive powers are considerably cramped by the want of\r\nan adequate market. How this most important object might be\r\neffected, and profitable occupation created for all the labour\r\nthat is now, or may be hereafter disposable in the colony, I have\r\nalready explained at considerable length; and it is under the\r\npresumption that my recommendations on this head will be deemed\r\nworthy of adoption, that I shall hereafter submit a plan for\r\ngradually diminishing the colonial expenditure.\r\n\r\nThe readiest way of accomplishing this object would be to\r\nabolish at once the system of victualling and clothing the\r\nconvicts from the king's stores; but this is impracticable and\r\nmust be done judiciously, and in proportion only to the gradually\r\nincreasing demand for labour. This mode of retrenchment, indeed,\r\nhas already been pushed further than circumstances have\r\nwarranted. The ticket of leave system, by which convicts are\r\npermitted to go on their own hands, and administer in any way\r\nthat they can to their own wants, though first intended as a\r\nreward to the really reformed and meritorious convict, has of\r\nlate years been resorted to as the most efficacious means of\r\nlessening the expences of the government. And hence the very end\r\nand aim of this colony, the reformation of the lawless gang who\r\nare transported to its shores, have been postponed to a paltry\r\nsaving, unworthy the character of the nation, and subversive in a\r\ngreat measure of the philanthropic intentions with which the\r\nlegislature were originally actuated. The alarming increase of\r\ncrime that has taken place within the last few years, is the\r\nre-action of this pernicious and mercenary system, which has\r\nalready been carried to such an extent as to endanger the lives\r\nand property of every honest and well disposed inhabitant of the\r\ncolony. This system, so injurious of itself, has been powerfully\r\nseconded by the lax and indiscriminate manner in which convict\r\nservants have been assigned to the various settlers. Being in\r\nmost instances freed or emancipated convicts themselves, many of\r\nthem possess but little character, and in fact only accept the\r\ndifferent indulgences that are held out to colonization, with a\r\nview to the immediate profit which they can derive from them, and\r\nwithout any intention of performing the remote conditions which\r\nthey tacitly or expressly enter into with the government. So long\r\nas their servants are victualled and clothed at the cost of the\r\ncrown, they in general avail themselves fully of their services,\r\nbut the moment this great indulgence ceases, they generally\r\ncompound with them, and in consideration of the performance of a\r\nstipulated quantity of labour free of expence, grant them an\r\nexemption from their employment for the remainder of the year,\r\nand consequently, a licence to prowl about the country, and\r\nplunder at every convenient opportunity, the honest and deserving\r\npart of the community. And although the present governor has\r\ntaken every step that could be devised for the suppression of\r\nthis pernicious practice, yet in consequence of the thinly\r\ninhabited state of the colony, and the remoteness of the various\r\nagricultural settlements from one another, circumstances which\r\nprevent the appointment of proper persons to detect and punish\r\nsuch violations of public orders, his efforts have been in a\r\ngreat degree unavailing. He is well aware of the nature of the\r\ndisease under which the colony is languishing, but he has not the\r\npower to administer the only effectual remedy. Create but a\r\nsufficient market for the colonial produce, and labour will then\r\nbecome too valuable to be suffered thus to remain in inactivity.\r\nIt will then and not before be the interest of the settlers to\r\npush their servants' exertions to the utmost. The competition\r\nthat will then exist for the products of labour, will be the best\r\nguarantee for its proper application. The method which I am about\r\nto submit for the suppression of this alarming state of anarchy\r\nand danger, will, it must be confessed, occasion a very\r\nconsiderable immediate addition of expence; but this is necessary\r\nto rectify the great and increasing evils of the ticket of leave\r\nsystem, and to insure the honest and laborious colonist that\r\nsecurity of person and property which the injudicious extension,\r\nwithin these few years, of this narrow-minded system has so\r\ngreatly endangered. Without the enjoyment of a full and\r\nsufficient protection, the colonists, however enlightened may be\r\nthe future conduct of their government in other respects, will\r\nmake but a timid and feeble advance in the various departments of\r\ninternal industry. A certainty of reaping the fruits of their\r\nexertions, is indeed an indispensable preliminary to the\r\nresumption of those active habits which have been so long\r\nparalyzed, and a recurrence to which is the main stock whereon\r\nall _shoots_ of future retrenchment must be engrafted. Under\r\na hope, therefore, that an internal legislature, which I again\r\ninsist can alone fully provide for the present and future\r\nnecessities of this colony will be established, I venture to\r\npropose the following plan for eventually diminishing the scale\r\nof its expenditure:\r\n\r\nFirst, That the ticket of leave system, except in as far as\r\nits continuance may be really essential to the promotion of good\r\nconduct in the convicts, should be abolished.\r\n\r\nSecondly, That the ticket of leave men, and all the convicts\r\nnow in the service of individuals, whether victualled and clothed\r\nat the expence of the crown or not, should be called in and\r\nre-assigned, either to their present masters or to others, and\r\nthat these should be allowed with them the premium hereafter to\r\nbe named; but that they should be previously in every instance\r\nrequired to give security to the government, that such convict\r\nservants should not on any account be permitted to be absent from\r\ntheir respective employments.\r\n\r\nThirdly, That instead of the present mode of victualling and\r\nclothing the convicts from the king's stores, the settlers should\r\nbe allowed a stipulated premium with them, one fifth less than\r\nthe actual cost of maintaining them, and that this premium should\r\ndiminish one fifth yearly from the date of the changes in the\r\ncolonial polity, which have been recommended.\r\n\r\nFourthly, That the price now directed to be paid convict\r\nservants for their extra time, should be reduced from £10\r\nin the men, to £5; and from £7 to £3\r\n10s. in the women: and that this reduction should be\r\nsubtracted from the amount of the above premium, and carried to\r\nthe credit of the government.\r\n\r\nFifthly, That all such convicts as may arrive in the colony\r\nwithin the five years next ensuing the above period, other than\r\nthose who may be required for the government works, should be in\r\nlike manner assigned to deserving applicants, with the decreased\r\npremium of the year in which they may arrive.\r\n\r\nSixthly, That at the expiration of the above period of five\r\nyears, the whole of the government works which are now for the\r\nmost part carried on by convicts, victualled and clothed from the\r\nking's stores, should be performed by contract.\r\n\r\nSeventhly, That the utmost encouragement should be held out by\r\nthe government to the emigration of wealthy individuals to the\r\ncolony; and that with a view to effect this object, not only a\r\npassage should be furnished them free of expence in the various\r\ntransports, which are annually sent thither, but that also the\r\nquantity of land to be hereafter granted them, should be\r\nincreased in proportion to their capital, from eight hundred\r\nacres (the present customary grant) up to five thousand.\r\n\r\nLastly, That the unappropriated lands most eligibly situated\r\nfor the purposes of colonization, should be surveyed and marked\r\nout into sections, each containing one square mile, or six\r\nhundred and forty acres; that each of these sections should be\r\nagain subdivided into four parts; that thirty-six of these\r\nsections should as in America form a township; that at stated\r\nperiods the lands so surveyed should be set up to auction, and\r\nsold to the best bidder, provided the price offered for them\r\nshould exceed one dollar per acre; if not, that they should be\r\nretained until they could be sold for such price at some\r\nsubsequent period; that the same credit should be given for the\r\npurchase of these lands as is given in America, and the same\r\ndiscount on ready money; and that the amount of such sales should\r\ngo to the Police Fund, and be employed in defraying the expences\r\nof the colony.\r\n\r\nThe object of the foregoing propositions must be too evident\r\nfrom the preliminary remarks which I have made, to need any\r\nextended illustration; nevertheless, it may not be altogether\r\ninexpedient to say a few words in further explanation of them to\r\nsuch persons as have bestowed no portion of their attention on\r\nthe circumstances and situation of this colony. The first,\r\nsecond, and third articles speak for themselves. The remedy here\r\nproposed for the alarming evils, which I have so copiously traced\r\nto the causes of their origin and continuance, will certainly\r\noccasion the government for the next five years a very great\r\nadditional expence; but after the most mature reflection on the\r\npresent impoverished state of this colony, and the deeply rooted\r\nhabits of idleness and vice, which a fifteen years' deprivation\r\nof the most important civil and political rights has occasioned,\r\nI can devise none besides that could be applied with any\r\nprobability of effecting a radical and permanent cure. The\r\narrangement recommended in the third article, I mean the\r\nsubstitution of a premium for the present mode of clothing and\r\nvictualling the convicts, would be highly favourable to the\r\nagricultural interests, both by limiting to the cultivators of\r\nthe soil, the supply of the food consumed by their servants, and\r\nby sparing them the trouble and expence of sending their carts\r\nfor it to the king's stores, an exemption which would be attended\r\nwith a considerable saving to such of them as inhabit districts\r\nremote from the towns: it would also be a source of economy to\r\nthe government, by enabling them to make a great reduction in the\r\ncommissariat department. The only objection I can anticipate to\r\nthis article, is, that it fixes an arbitrary rate of reduction on\r\nthe premium to be allowed the settlers with the convicts; and\r\nthat this rate may prove greater than the advance which the\r\ncolony may make in the various avenues of internal industry. This\r\nmay possibly be the case, although I consider the period I have\r\nnamed sufficiently protracted to allow the colonists due time to\r\nascertain the nature and extent of their newly acquired\r\nprivileges, and to profit by them. If, however, it were\r\npracticable, it would certainly be more eligible that they\r\nthemselves should become the arbiters of the abatement which\r\nshould annually take place in the premium to be given with the\r\nconvicts. I do not, however, well know how this desideratum could\r\nbe effected, unless the grand juries during the circuit of the\r\ncourts in the different districts, could be empowered to inquire\r\ninto and determine the increase that may take place in the demand\r\nfor labour, and regulate the price of it, or in other words the\r\npremium to be given with it accordingly. To detract as far as\r\npossible from the increased expence which would follow the\r\nadoption of the measures recommended in the first, second, and\r\nthird articles, is the object of the fourth. By making the\r\nabatement here proposed in the amount of the wages now directed\r\nto be paid by the settlers to their convict servants, and\r\ncarrying it to the credit of the government, an immediate saving\r\nof £5 per man, and £3 10s. per woman would be\r\neffected. And if the calculation be accurate that each male\r\nconvict victualled and clothed at the expence of the crown costs\r\n£18, and each female £12 10s. it will be seen\r\nthat above one fourth more might be supported by the government\r\nin the manner here recommended, and that likewise a fifth might\r\nbe annually added to the number, without occasioning any increase\r\nwhatever in the colonial expenditure. The weight too of this mode\r\nof retrenchment would not fall on the settler, and by operating\r\nas a check to agriculture perhaps prolong the period when the\r\nvarious departments of industry will be enabled to absorb the\r\nlarge mass of labour which is annually regurgitated on the shores\r\nof this colony, but on the convicts themselves, to whose\r\nreformation indeed, (the primary object of its foundation) it is\r\nessential that every incentive to the renewal of their ancient\r\ndisorderly and profligate habits should be withdrawn. Even with\r\nthis diminished scale of wages, the situation of the convicts\r\nwould be far preferable to that of the labouring class in this\r\ncountry. £2 10s. to the men, and £1\r\n10s. to the women, would then remain, independently of\r\ntheir food and clothing, which is surely quite sufficient for the\r\n\"_menus plaisirs_\" of a set of persons who are supposed to\r\nbe smarting under the lash of the law. Article fifth needs no\r\nexplanation. Article sixth, contemplates the saving that might be\r\neffected in the public works of the government, by exchanging at\r\nthe expiration of the period, when the bounty to be allowed to\r\nsettlers with convicts shall cease, the present mode of carrying\r\nthem on by a body of men, victualled and clothed at the expence\r\nof the crown, for the more economical plan of contracting for\r\nthem with the lowest bidder. I limit the commencement of this\r\nmethod of retrenchment to the above period, because so long as a\r\nnecessity exists for giving a bounty with convicts, there can be\r\nno doubt that it would be judicious for the government to profit\r\nas far as possible by the labour of persons whom even in the\r\nemployment of individuals, they would be in a great measure\r\nobliged to support. But the moment this necessity shall cease, it\r\nis equally indubitable that a considerable saving might be\r\neffected by carrying on the public works by contract. Where a\r\nbody of fourteen or fifteen hundred convicts are employed under\r\nthe superintendence of the most active and upright man, there\r\nwill always be a system of idleness and plunder, which his\r\nassiduity will never be able entirely to baffle. Out of the\r\nimmense number of minor agents on whose intelligence and\r\nintegrity he would be obliged to place a considerable degree of\r\ndependence, it is not readily to be believed, however great may\r\nbe his activity and discrimination, that he would not be\r\nfrequently deceived, and that those very men on whom he most\r\nrelied to suppress the dishonest inclinations of others, would\r\nnot themselves occasionally profit by the facilities to plunder\r\nand peculation, which the confidence they enjoyed might throw in\r\ntheir way. That such is, and always has been the case in this\r\ncolony, no person at all conversant with its real state, can have\r\nany hesitation in asserting; and consequently that the\r\nsubstitution of contracts in the place of the present mode of\r\nconducting the public works, would become a very important source\r\nof economy at the period in question. Article the seventh, is\r\nintended to encourage emigration to the colony, and to turn to\r\nits shores some portion of the immense numbers who are annually\r\nwithdrawing from this country to the United States of America. It\r\nappears almost inexplicable how the government can look on, and\r\nbehold the thousands who are propelled by various causes to quit\r\ntheir native land, and not make some vigorous efforts, if not to\r\ncheck this strong tide of emigration, at least to divert it to\r\nour colonies, where in general it is so much required, and might\r\nbecome of such immense and permanent utility to the empire. It is\r\ntrue that of those who thus abandon the land of their\r\nforefathers, many are actuated by political animosities, and\r\ncould not by any means be induced to settle in any of our\r\ncolonies. But it is not less certain that there are others, and\r\nthat the majority are of this class, whom mere distress and\r\ninability to provide for the growing wants of their families,\r\nunalloyed with any political feelings whatever, most reluctantly\r\ndrive to seek an asylum in America, and who deeply lament the\r\nnecessity of betaking themselves to a country where they and\r\ntheir children may one day be compelled to draw their paricidal\r\nswords against the mother that gave them birth. It cannot indeed\r\nbe denied that the government to prevent this horrible\r\nalternative, have for a long time held out considerable\r\nencouragements to persons emigrating to Canada; but besides that\r\nthe policy of thus peopling at so considerable an expence a\r\ncountry which in the natural course of events must become an\r\nintegral member of the American union, is at least questionable,\r\nit is well known that three-fourths of those who are thus induced\r\nto settle in Canada, end by removing to the United States. The\r\nintense severity of the winters, and the unavoidable suspension\r\nof the pursuits of agriculture during six months in the year,\r\nwith the habits and language of the Canadians, so repulsive and\r\nannoying to the generality of Englishmen, sufficiently account\r\nfor this circumstance, without taking into computation the\r\nsuperior advantages of climate and soil which the greater part of\r\nthe United States is represented as possessing. If the impolicy,\r\ntherefore, of encouraging emigration to Canada be disputed, still\r\nthe inefficiency of the means employed to attain the end\r\ncontemplated by the government ought to decide them to try some\r\nother expedient to prevent so large a stock of British industry\r\nand capital from thus adding to the resources of a nation, who is\r\nalready the most formidable, as she is the most rancorous on the\r\nlist of our enemies. No measure, perhaps, that could be adopted\r\nwould tend so effectually to the accomplishment of this object,\r\nas holding out the great encouragement specified in this article\r\nto all such as may settle in this colony. Possessed as it is of a\r\nmost salubrious and diversified climate, fertile soil, and\r\nunbounded extent of territory, it evidently contains every\r\nrequisite for the formation of a great and flourishing community;\r\nand whenever it shall be blessed with a free government will\r\noffer much greater facilities for the development of industry and\r\nthe acquisition of wealth, than are to be found in the United\r\nStates. Until the colony, however, shall possess this fundamental\r\nprivilege, every attempt of the government to divert the current\r\nof emigration thither from America must prove in a great measure\r\nunavailing. A free constitution is the first want of those who\r\nhave known the blessings of one; and no prospects of profit to an\r\nhonourable and independent mind can compensate for its loss.\r\nThere can be little doubt, therefore, that as soon as this\r\nindispensable preliminary to general emigration shall be granted,\r\nthousands of persons will embark for this colony, and continue to\r\ncontribute to the wealth and power of their native country, who\r\nwould otherwise become citizens of her most formidable and\r\ninveterate rival.\r\n\r\nThe adoption also of the measures here recommended, would have\r\na sensible effect in diminishing the expenditure of this colony;\r\nand would amply compensate for any loss which the government\r\nmight sustain by affording settlers a passage thither, free of\r\nexpence, in the transports. I commenced this section by an\r\nattempt to prove that the great immediate hindrance to the\r\nemployment of the large mass of unoccupied labour in the various\r\nnew departmeuts of internal industry that will be created by the\r\nestablishment of a free government, will arise from the want of\r\ncapital; and the premium I have recommended to be granted with\r\nconvicts for the first five years ensuing the proposed change in\r\nthe colonial polity, is intended to impart an _artificial_\r\nvigour into the community, and to allow of that accumulation of\r\nwealth, which may afterwards suffice of itself to keep in\r\nsolution all the disposable labour of the colony. Every\r\naccession, therefore, of capital that may take place, will\r\ncontribute to swell the colonial stock to that extent which is\r\nnecessary for the complete occupation of the convicts, and thus\r\nbecome the means of accelerating the period when the government\r\nwill be entirely emancipated from the necessity of allowing the\r\nsettlers a bounty with them.\r\n\r\nThe last article scarcely needs any explanation. Whenever that\r\nextensive emigration of capitalists which I confidently\r\nanticipate would follow the establishment of a free government\r\nshall take place, the sale of the crown lands would evidently\r\nbecome a source of considerable profit, and would go a long way\r\ntowards defraying the expences of the colony. It would also be\r\nthe means of bringing numbers of rich speculators thither, who\r\nwonld not think of emigrating even for the increased indulgences\r\nwhich I have recommended in the foregoing article. A man of\r\nfortune would then be enabled to vest his money in land to the\r\nexact extent that he might desire; whereas at present, he must\r\neither be content with the portion assigned him, or else purchase\r\nby _dribblets_ the _farms_ that may become vacant in\r\nthe vicinity of his estate, and after all perhaps, be annoyed by\r\nhaving the possessions of others in the midst of his own. It is\r\ntrue that individuals, who do not possess sufficient land for the\r\nsupport of their flocks and herds, are allowed to feed them on\r\nthe unappropriated lands, and can therefore increase their stock\r\nto any extent they may please. But the rapid progress of\r\ncolonization places the crown lands every day at a greater\r\ndistance from the original settlements, and occasions a constant\r\nnecessity for receding, so that at last that part of his stock\r\nwhich the farmer cannot feed at home is gradually removed to an\r\ninconvenient distance, and no longer can have the benefit of his\r\npersonal superintendence. With men of capital, therefore, the\r\nclass of whom it has been seen that the colony is most in need,\r\nthis sale of the crown lands at half the price which is demanded\r\nfor land in America, would prove a very powerful stimulus to\r\nemigration, and would consequently have a twofold operation in\r\ndiminishing the expenditure of this colony; viz. by filling the\r\ncoffers of the Police Fund, and by occasioning that accession of\r\ncapital, which I have before shewn to be essential before the\r\ngovernment can be freed from the burden of supporting the\r\nconvicts.\r\n\r\nOn the Advantages which the Colony offers for\r\nEmigration.\r\n\r\nAfter the gloomy picture which I have drawn of the actual\r\ncondition of the colony; after having represented both its\r\nagricultural and commercial interests as being already not only\r\nin a state of impair, but also of increasing dilapidation and\r\nruin, it may appear somewhat paradoxical that I should attempt to\r\nwind up the account with an enumeration of the advantages which\r\nit holds out to emigration. If due consideration, however, be\r\ngiven to the nature of the ingredients of which the agricultural\r\nbody is composed; if it be recollected that it consists\r\nprincipally of persons, who have been since their earliest years\r\nhabituated to every sort of vice and debauchery; of persons bred\r\nup in cities, and unacquainted with the arts of husbandry, who\r\nhad, therefore, to contend against the combined force of an\r\ninveterate propensity to the profligate indulgences of their\r\n_ancient_ mode of life, and of utter ignorance of the\r\nlaborious occupations and thrifty arts of their _new_: I say\r\nif all these serious impediments to success be impartially\r\nweighed, it will be seen that the _anomaly_ is rather\r\n_apparent_ than _real_. Nevertheless I do not mean to\r\nimply that this colony or its dependencies, present at this\r\nmoment any very flattering prospects for the _mere\r\nagriculturist_. That the _skilful farmer_ would be\r\nenabled to obtain an _independent_ and _comfortable\r\nsubsistence_ is, however, _indubitable_; and the larger\r\nhis family, provided they were of sufficient age to afford him an\r\neffectual co-operation, the greater would be his chance of a\r\nsuccessful establishment. Hundreds of this laborious class of\r\npeople, who in spite of unremitting toil and frugality, find\r\nthemselves every day getting behind-hand with the world, would\r\nundoubtedly better their condition by emigrating to this colony,\r\nif there were only a probability that they would be enabled to go\r\non from day to day as they are doing here. In this country they\r\nare at best but _tenants_ of the soil they cultivate;\r\nwhereas there they would be _proprietors_, and the _mere\r\nadvance_ which would be taking place in the value of their\r\nfarms, would before many years not only render them\r\n_independent_ but even _wealthy_. Of the truth of this\r\nassertion, we shall be fully convinced by referring to the price\r\nof land on the banks of the Hawkesbury and Nepean rivers, the\r\nonly parts which can be said to be even tolerably colonized. It\r\nhas already been stated that as far as the river Hawkesbury is\r\nnavigable, the unimproved land is worth five pounds per acre, and\r\nimproved land double this amount. This land was at first of no\r\nvalue whatever; because in the infancy of societies, so long as\r\nthere is an unlimited scope of land of the first quality, which\r\nany one may occupy as far as his occasions require, it is evident\r\nthat there would be no purchasers; since it is absurd to imagine\r\nthat any one would buy that which he could obtain for nothing. It\r\nis only, as Mr. Ricardo has demonstrated, when land of an\r\ninferior quality is brought into cultivation, and when the\r\ndifference in the produce of the two sorts gives the occupier of\r\nthe one a superiority over the occupier of the other, and renders\r\nit as eligible for a person to cultivate land of the first\r\ndescription as a tenant, and to pay the proprietor the difference\r\nof produce by way of rent, as to be himself the proprietor of\r\nland of the second description; or when the situation of the\r\ndifferent appropriated tracts of land does not admit of the\r\nconveyance of their produce to market at an equal cost; and thus\r\nagain gives the owners of those farms which are more contiguous,\r\nan advantage over the owners of those which are more remote: I\r\nsay it is only when societies have made that progress, which\r\nbegets one or other of these contingencies, or both, that land is\r\nof any value whatever. In the course, therefore, of thirty-one\r\nyears, the tract of land in question, taking the unimproved part\r\nas our criterion, since the improvements made in that portion of\r\nit, which is in a state of cultivation, may be considered\r\ntantamount to the difference in value between the one and the\r\nother, has evidently risen to this enormous price, from having\r\nbeen of no worth whatever: or in other words, each acre of land\r\nhas increased in value during the interval that has elapsed since\r\nthe foundation of the colony at the rate of 3s. 2\r\n1/2d. per annum; and this too under the most impolitic and\r\noppressive system, to which any colony, perhaps, was ever\r\nsubjected. How much greater then, will be the future rise in the\r\nvalue of landed property, if, as there is now every reason to\r\nhope from the attention which the government are at this moment\r\npaying to the state of this colony, the whole of the disabilities\r\nunder which its inhabitants have been so long groaning, should at\r\nlength be abandoned? Without taking at all into the estimate the\r\nimmediate amelioration which a radical change in the polity of\r\nthis colony, would occasion in the condition of the agricultural\r\nbody; without depending on the probability that it will soon be\r\nin the power of the laborious and frugal settler to rise rapidly\r\nto wealth and independence; it must be evident that the mere\r\nincrease which is yearly taking place in the value of landed\r\nproperty, affords of itself the strongest inducement to\r\nemigration; since if it does not hold out to the industrious man\r\nthe prospect of acquiring immediate wealth, it relieves him from\r\nall apprehensions for his family, should a premature destiny\r\novertake himself. He at least knows that every succeeding year\r\nwill be augmenting in a rapid manner the value of his farm, and\r\nthat the same spot which administers to his and their present\r\nwants, cannot fail to suffice for their future. This is of itself\r\na most consolatory prospect; it at all events prevents the\r\npresent good from being embittered with any dread of future evil;\r\nit permits the industrious man the tranquil enjoyment of the\r\nfruits of his labours, and rescues him from the necessity of\r\nhoarding up against the approach of gathering calamity, against\r\nthe stormy season of impending poverty.\r\n\r\nThe amelioration, that would take place in the condition of\r\nthe mere labourer, who should emigrate to this colony, without\r\nfunds adequate to the formation of an agricultural establishment,\r\nwould not be so considerable. Still there can be no doubt that\r\nthe honest and industrious man would always be able to provide\r\nfor himself and his family a sufficiency of food and clothing;\r\ncomforts which with his utmost endeavours he can hardly obtain in\r\nthis country without having recourse to parochial relief. He\r\nwould, therefore, at all events emancipate himself from this\r\nhumiliating,--this demoralizing necessity; for although there is\r\nconfessedly a greater portion of labour in the colony than can at\r\npresent be maintained in activity, any person who might emigrate\r\nthither voluntarily would easily find employment, when those who\r\nare, or have been under the operation of the law would seek for\r\nit in vain. A good character is a jewel of greater value there\r\nthan in this country, because it is more difficult to be met\r\nwith; and consequently all the advantages which it procures its\r\npossessor in the one place, it will insure him at least in a\r\ntwo-fold measure in the other.\r\n\r\nThe colony offers very little encouragement to the\r\nmanufacturer. The manufacturing interests are not at present in\r\nthe most prosperous situation; and if the government should, as\r\nthere is every probability, at length adopt those measures which\r\nare called for by every consideration of justice and expediency,\r\na few years will annihilate them entirely. To this class\r\ntherefore, with reference both to the proprietor and workman, a\r\nremoval to this colony would undoubtedly be prejudicial.\r\n\r\nFor the artisan and mechanic, who are skilled in the works of\r\nutility, rather than of luxury, there is, as it has been already\r\nremarked, no part of the world, perhaps, which affords an equal\r\nchance of success. To any, therefore, who have the means of\r\ntransporting themselves and families to this colony, the removal\r\nwould be in the highest degree advantageous. They could not fail\r\nto find immediate employment, and receive a more liberal return\r\nfor their labour, than they would be able to procure elsewhere.\r\nThe blacksmith, carpenter, cooper, stone-mason, brick-layer,\r\nbrick-maker, wheel and plough-wright, harness-maker, tanner,\r\nshoe-maker, taylor, cabinet-maker, ship-wright, sawyer, etc. etc.\r\nwould very soon become independent, if they possessed sufficient\r\nprudence to save the money which they would earn. For the master\r\nartisan and mechanic, the prospect of course is still more\r\ncheering; since the labour they would be enabled to command would\r\nbe proportioned to the extent of their capital.\r\n\r\nThe advantages, however, which the colony offers to this class\r\nof emigrants, _great_ as they undoubtedly are, when\r\nconsidered in an isolated point of view, are absolutely of _no\r\nweight_ when placed in the balance of comparison against those\r\nwhich it offers to the capitalist, who has the means to embark\r\nlargely in the breeding of fine woolled sheep. It may be safely\r\nasserted that of _all_ the _various openings_ which the\r\nworld at this moment affords for the _profitable investment_\r\nof money, there is not _one equally inviting_ as this\r\n_single channel_ of _enterprize_ offered by the colony.\r\nThe proof of this assertion I shall rest on a calculation so\r\nplain and intelligible, as I hope to be within the scope of the\r\ncomprehension of all. Before we proceed, however, it is necessary\r\nto settle a few points, as the data on which this calculation is\r\nto be founded; viz. the value of wool, the weight of the fleece,\r\nand the number of sheep to be kept in a flock. With regard to the\r\nvalue of the wool grown in this colony, the last importations of\r\nthe best quality averaged five shillings and sixpence per pound\r\nin the fleece. This was sold last month; [March, 1819] and as the\r\nmarket was at that time overcharged, and as moreover the best\r\ndescription of wool yet produced in this colony, is far from\r\nhaving attained the perfection of which it is capable, and which\r\na few more crosses with the pure breed will undoubtedly effect in\r\nit, it may be safely concluded, that this is the lowest price at\r\nwhich this sort of wool will ever be sold. This will be more\r\nevident, if we contemplate the gradual rise in value, which the\r\nwool from the same gentleman's flocks has been experiencing\r\nduring the last four years. In 1816, it was sold for 2s.\r\n6d. per pound in the fleece; in March, 1818, for\r\n3s. 6d. per pound; in July, 1818, for 4s.\r\n4d. per pound; and in March, 1819, for 5s.\r\n6d. per pound in the fleece. For some of this last\r\nquantity of wool, properly sorted and washed, Mr. Hurst of Leeds\r\nwas offered 9s. per pound, and refused it. To take the\r\nfuture average price of wool at 5s. 6d. per pound,\r\nis, therefore, forming an estimate, which in all probability will\r\nfall far short of the truth. However, let this be one of our\r\ndata; and let us allow three pounds, which is also an estimate\r\nequally moderate, as the average weight of each fleece. The\r\nweight of a yearling's fleece may be taken at three quarters of a\r\npound, and the value of the wool at 2s. 9d. per\r\npound. The number of ewes generally kept in a flock by the best\r\nbreeders are about 330, and we will suppose that the emigrant has\r\nthe means of purchasing a flock of this size of the most improved\r\nbreed: this with a sufficient number of tups may be had for\r\n£1000. These points being determined, let us now proceed to\r\nour calculation.\r\n\r\n[Table not included in this text version--see html version. Ed.]\r\n\r\nIt would be useless to prosecute this calculation, since any\r\nperson who may be anxious to ascertain its further results, may\r\neasily follow it up himself. It will be seen that with the most\r\nliberal allowances for all manner of expenses, casualties and\r\ndeteriorations, capital invested in this channel will yield the\r\nfirst year an interest of 13½ per cent. besides\r\nexperiencing itself an increase of nearly 24 per cent.; that the\r\nsecond year it will yield an interest of nearly 25 per cent.\r\nbesides experiencing itself a further increase of rather more\r\nthan 37½ per cent.; and that the third year it will yield\r\nan interest of nearly 37 per cent. besides experiencing itself an\r\nadditional increase of about 42½ per cent. or, in other\r\nwords, money sunk in the rearing of sheep in this colony will,\r\nbesides paying an interest of about 75½ _per cent_.\r\nin the _course_ of _three years_, _rather more than\r\ndouble itself_. Here then is a mode of investing capital by\r\nwhich the proprietor may insure himself not only an annual\r\ninterest, the ratio of which would augment every year in the most\r\nastonishing progression, but by which the capital itself also\r\nwould experience an advance still more rapid and extraordinary.\r\nAny person, therefore, who has the means of embarking in this\r\nspeculation, could not fail with common attention to realize a\r\nlarge fortune in a few years. His chance of so doing would be\r\nstill greater if he should happen to be acquainted with the\r\nmanagement of sheep; but this is by no means an\r\n_indispensable_ qualification; for such is the fineness of\r\nthe climate, both in the settlements in New Holland and Van\r\nDiemen's Land, that all those precautions which are necessary to\r\nbe observed in this country, in order to shelter this animal from\r\nthe inclemency of the seasons, are there, quite superfluous:\r\nsheds, indeed, are not only useless, but injurious; the flocks\r\nnever do so well as when they are continually exposed to the\r\nweather. It is only necessary that the folds should be shifted\r\nevery other day, or if the sheep are kept by night in yards, to\r\ntake care that _these_ are daily swept out.\r\n\r\nThe extent to which capital might thus be invested is\r\nboundless; since if the breeder did not possess as much land as\r\nwould feed the number of sheep that he might wish to keep, he\r\nwould only have to send his flocks beyond the limits of\r\ncolonization, and retire with them as the tide of population\r\napproached. His hurdles, and the rude huts or tents of his\r\nshepherds, might always be removed with very little difficulty\r\nand expense; and if his and his neighbours' flocks should happen\r\nto come into contact, such is the immensity of the wilderness\r\nwhich would lie before him, that he might exclaim in the language\r\nof Abram to Lot: \"Let there be no strife I pray thee between me\r\nand thee, and between my herdsmen and thy herds-men; for we be\r\nbrethren. Is not the whole land before us? Separate thyself I\r\npray thee from me. If thou wilt take the left hand, then I will\r\ngo to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will\r\ngo to the left.\" Such, should any of these disputes occur, might\r\nalways be their amicable termination. There is, and will be for\r\nages to come, whatever may be the extent of emigration, more land\r\nthan can possibly be required. The speculation, therefore, of\r\ngrowing wool can meet with no checks from the want of pasturage\r\nin the colony, and it is equally improbable that it can be\r\nimpeded by the want of a market in this country. It is well known\r\nthat the Saxon wool cannot be sold under the present prices\r\nwithout loss to the growers. The severity of the climate of\r\nSaxony, renders it indispensable for the sheep-holders to take a\r\nvariety of precautions which are not only useless in this colony,\r\nbut would even prove highly detrimental to the constitution of\r\nthis valuable animal. In the former country, the flocks are kept\r\nalmost invariably in sheds of a very costly construction both by\r\nday and night, and are fed almost wholly upon hay; in the latter,\r\nthey are always better when kept in the open air and fed on the\r\nspontaneous herbage of the forest. The mildness of the seasons,\r\ntherefore, spares the colonists two immense sources of expence,\r\nand will without doubt in the end, enable them to undersell and\r\nruin the Saxon wool growers; since the only point of superiority\r\nthese latter can pretend to is their greater contiguity to the\r\nmarket, and this, in consequence of the extreme value of the\r\ncommodity, is of too trifling import to demand consideration. The\r\nfreight of wool from the colony, has already been reduced to\r\nthree pence per pound, which is very little more than is paid for\r\nthe transport of wool from Saxony; and all the other expences,\r\nwith the exception of insurance, as brokerage, store-room, etc.\r\nare precisely the same. Upon these grounds, therefore, I am\r\ncontented to rest the support of my assertion, that the world\r\ndoes not at present contain so advantageous, and I might also\r\nadd, so extensive an opening for the investment of capital as the\r\none in question.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the commercial prospects presented by this\r\ncolony, they are certainly much more limited, but still of very\r\nconsiderable scope. The extraordinary fluctuations which are\r\nincessantly taking place in the prices of all sorts of\r\nmerchandize, are evidently capable of being turned to great\r\naccount by a skilful and cool calculator. Any person of this\r\ncharacter possessed of sufficient capital to enable him to buy\r\ngoods when the market should happen to be in a state of\r\ndepression, and to keep them in his store till the glut should\r\npass by, could not fail to realize a rapid fortune. The only\r\nevent that could prevent his success, would be an imprudent\r\navidity. If he should be once tempted to go out of his depth, so\r\nthat he would be compelled to sell whether at gain or loss, in\r\norder to make good his payments, he would most probably sink\r\nnever more to rise. But if he would never speculate beyond the\r\ncompass of his actual means, he might easily clear fifty per\r\ncent. per annum on the amount of his trading capital.\r\n\r\nWere I asked to particularize any avenue of industry not\r\nstrictly included in any of the foregoing general classes, in\r\nwhich persons inclined to emigrate to this colony, might embark\r\nwith a fair chance of success, I should say that any one who had\r\nthe means of taking out a steam engine of six or\r\neight-horse-power with the requisite machinery for sawing boards,\r\nwould make it answer his purposes very well; that a timber\r\nmerchant also, possessing a capital of three or four thousand\r\npounds, might employ his funds very advantageously by\r\nestablishing a timber yard; and that a skilful brewer who could\r\ncommand five thousand pounds and upwards, would succeed either at\r\nSydney or Hobart Town. It would be necessary, however, that he\r\nshould understand the process of making malt, since there are no\r\nregular maltsters yet in the colony, and that he should also grow\r\nhis own hops.* Until, therefore, he had established a hop\r\nplantation sufficient for his concern it would be requisite that\r\nhe should make arrangements to be supplied with hops from this\r\ncountry. There are already several breweries in New South Wales,\r\nbut the beer which is made in them is so bad, that many thousand\r\npounds worth of porter and ale imported from this country, is\r\nannually consumed in these settlements. This is in some measure\r\noccasioned by the inferiority of the barley grown at Port\r\nJackson; but more, I am inclined to believe, by the want of skill\r\nin the brewers. If the indifferent quality of the beer, however,\r\nbe attributable to the badness of the barley, this impediment to\r\nsuccess would be removed by emigrating to Van Diemen's Land;\r\nsince the barley raised in both the settlements in this island is\r\nequal to the best produced in this country. I should also say,\r\nthat the skilful dairyman who could take out with him a capital\r\nof from one to two thousand pounds, would do well in any of these\r\nsettlements, but more particularly in New South Wales. Butter, as\r\nit has been already remarked, is still as high as 2s.\r\n6d. per pound, notwithstanding the immense increase which\r\nhas taken place in the black cattle. The extreme dearness of this\r\narticle arises principally from the natural grasses not being\r\nsufficiently nutritive to keep milch cattle in good heart, and\r\nfrom the colonists not having yet got into the proper method of\r\nproviding artificial food. Any one, therefore, who would\r\nintroduce the dairy system practised in this country, could\r\nhardly fail of finding his account in it.\r\n\r\n[* The hop thrives very well at Port Jackson: there\r\nare several flourishing plantations owned by the brewers. This\r\nplant has not, I believe, yet been introduced into the southern\r\nsettlements; but as they bear a much greater affinity to this\r\ncountry in point of climate than Port Jackson, no doubt can be\r\nentertained that it might at least be cultivated there with equal\r\ncertainty of success.]\r\n\r\nThese various advantages which this colony and its\r\ndependencies offer for emigration, have many points of\r\nsuperiority over any to which the United States of America can\r\nlay claim; if we even admit the truth of all that the most\r\nenthusiastic admirers of that country have written, respecting\r\nits flourishing condition. Mr. Birbeck*, whose \"Letters,\" if not\r\n\"Notes,\" contain strong marks of an exaggerated anticipation of\r\ntheir resources and capabilities, has not, though evidently under\r\nthe influence of feelings quite incompatible with a correct and\r\ndisinterested judgment, ventured to rate his imaginary maximum of\r\nthe profit to be derived from farming in the Illinois, (which\r\nappears to be the principal magnet of attraction possessed by the\r\nUnited States,) so high as I have proved by a calculation, to\r\nwhich I defy any one to attach the character of hyperbolical,\r\nthat the investment of capital in the growth of fine wool in this\r\ncolony will infallibly produce. This too, although certainly the\r\nmost inviting and extensive channel of enterprize which it\r\ncontains, is not its only ground of preference: it has many\r\ntemptations besides for emigration, of which the United States\r\nare wholly destitute: among these the following are perhaps the\r\nmost considerable.\r\n\r\n[* See Mr. Cobbett's Letter to Mr. Birbeck on his\r\n\"Letters from the Illinois.\"]\r\n\r\nFirst, Any person of respectability upon emigrating to this\r\ncolony, is given as much land as would cost him four hundred\r\npounds in the United States.\r\n\r\nSecondly, He is allowed as many servants as he may require;\r\nand the wages which he is bound to pay them, are not one third\r\nthe amount of the price of labour in America.\r\n\r\nThirdly, He, his family and servants, are victualled at the\r\nexpence of the government for six months.\r\n\r\nThese are three considerations of great importance to the\r\nemigrant, and quite peculiar to this colony: added to which the\r\nvalue of the produce of this gratuitous land and labour is three\r\ntimes as great as in the Illinois, as will be seen by a\r\ncomparison of the prices of produce there as given by Messrs.\r\nBirbeck and Fearon, and the prices of similar produce as stated\r\nin the first part of this work. It is true that there is not the\r\nsame unlimited market as in America; but it must be evident,\r\nthat, if the price of labour were even equal, the colonist who\r\ncould dispose of one third of his crops, would be in a better\r\ncondition than if he were established in the Illinois, and could\r\nfind vent for the whole. The market, however, has never been\r\ncircumscribed to this degree in periods of the greatest\r\nabundance; and the immense arrivals of convicts, that have been\r\ndaily taking place for the last three years, have increased the\r\nconsumptive powers of the colony so considerably, that there has\r\nat most been but a very trifling surplus in the barns of the\r\nfarmers at the close of the year. On the other hand, all articles\r\nof foreign growth and manufacture are in general much cheaper\r\nthan in the Illinois, and the other remote parts of the American\r\nUnion, provided the purchaser has ready money, and is not under\r\nthe necessity of having recourse to secondary agents for goods on\r\nlong credit.\r\n\r\nHere, then, are many powerful reasons why persons bent on\r\nemigration should prefer this colony to America. The only point\r\nis whether the latter can throw any weightier arguments into the\r\nopposite _scale_. What may be urged on the other side of the\r\nquestion, may, I apprehend, be comprised under these two heads:\r\nfirst, the greater contiguity of the United States to this\r\ncountry, and the consequent ease and cheapness with which\r\nemigration thither may be effected; and, secondly, the\r\nsuperiority of their government.\r\n\r\nThe first of these points merits very little consideration,\r\nexcept in the instance of those who have not the means of\r\nchoosing between the two countries. If a person only possess the\r\npower of removing to that which is the more contiguous,\r\neligibility is out of the question: he is no longer a free agent.\r\nBut the difference in the cost of emigrating is far from being so\r\nconsiderable as might be imagined on a mere view of their\r\ncomparative distances from this country. I understand that a\r\ngentleman of great experience and respectability in the\r\ncommercial world, has presented a calculation to the committee of\r\nthe House of Commons, which is now occupied with an inquiry into\r\nthe state of this colony, from which it appears that a family,\r\nconsisting of a man, his wife and two children, with five tons\r\nfor their accommodation and for the reception of their baggage,\r\nmight emigrate to the colony for one hundred pounds, inclusive of\r\nevery contingent expense, provided a sufficient number of\r\nfamilies could be collected to freight a ship. The same gentleman\r\ncalculates that a single man might be taken out thither for\r\nthirty pounds.* The difference, therefore, in the mere cost of\r\nemigrating to the two places is so trifling, that the superior\r\nlocality of the one cannot be admitted as any sort of set off\r\nagainst the superior advantages of the other. With respect,\r\nhowever, to the last plea, that has been adduced in favour of\r\nemigration to the United States, the superiority which they\r\npossess in a free government, it must be admitted, that this is a\r\ndecisive ground of preference, and a blessing to which the\r\ngreatest pecuniary advantages cannot be considered a sufficient\r\ncounterpoise. And if it be imagined that the present arbitrary\r\nsystem of government is not drawing to a conclusion; if it be\r\napprehended that it has not yet reached its climax of oppression\r\nand iniquity, and that it will be enforced until all who are\r\nwithin the sphere of its influence are reduced to a state of\r\nmoral degradation and infamy, and the colony becomes one vast\r\nstye of abomination and depravity; the emigrant will do well to\r\ndiscard from his mind every mercenary consideration, and to turn\r\naway with disgust from all prospects of gain; so long as they are\r\nonly to be realized by entering into so contagious and\r\ndemoralizing an association. But if he believe that the hour is\r\nat hand when the present system is to be abolished; when\r\noppression is to be hurled from the car in which it has driven\r\ntriumphantly over prostrate justice, virtue, and religion; and\r\nwhen the dominion of right and morality is to be asserted and\r\nestablished; then I have no hesitation in recommending him to\r\ngive a preference to this colony. In the agonies of approaching\r\ndissolution, the efforts of tyranny will be feeble and impotent.\r\nMoral corruption, though the inevitable result of a voluntary\r\nsubmission to the will, is not the consequence of an indignant\r\nand impatient sufferance of its rule for a season; and the chance\r\nof personal injury would be still more precarious and uncertain.\r\nUnder the most arbitrary governments the vengeance of the despot\r\nhas seldom been known to extend beyond the circle of his court;\r\nhis victims have been among the ambitious candidates for power\r\nand distinction. The retired pursuits of unobtrusive industry\r\nhave proved a sanctuary, which has remained inviolate in all\r\nages.\r\n\r\n[* See a calculation in the Appendix made by an eminent merchant\r\nin the city; from which it appears that a single man, on the\r\nration allowed sailors on board of a king's ship, might be\r\nconveyed to the colony at a still cheaper rate.]\r\n\r\n\"The lifted axe, the agonizing wheel,\r\nLuke's iron crown, and Damien's bed of steel,\r\nTo men remote from pow'r but rarely known,\r\nLeave reason, faith, and conscience all our own.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\nCivil Establishment, and Public Institutions in the Territory\r\nof New South Wales and its Dependencies.\r\n\r\nSeat of Government, Sydney.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nCaptain General, Governor in Chief, Vice Admiral, and\r\nCommander of the Forces, His Excellency Lachlan Macquarie, Esq.\r\nMajor General in the Army, and Lieutenant Colonel of the 73d\r\nRegiment.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nLieutenant Governor--James Erskine, Esq.

The ground should if possible be prepared a month\r\nbefore the planting, and a preference given by the country\r\ngardener to new ground, or dry wheat stubble, where the soil is\r\nlight. The town gardener should keep his ground in a good state\r\nby frequent light manuring.\r\n\r\nThe sets made choice of should be the produce of the last\r\nwinter crop; and when planted should have a covering of light\r\nmanure; without which the ground will be impoverished; but with\r\nsuch assistance be improved.\r\n\r\nThe best potatoes to preserve for sets are of a middle size,\r\nas well for profit as security; for if the largest are made use\r\nof, there must be a considerable waste; and those of the dwarf\r\nkind should be rejected, from their degeneracy and weakness.\r\n\r\nAn experienced gardener, who has been a settler here more than\r\ntwenty years, plants his seed potatoes uncut for the winter crop;\r\nhis reason for which is, that if they are cut they are likely to\r\nperish in the ground, from the rains of March; which will not be\r\nthe case if put in whole.\r\n\r\nIn July the ground should be prepared for the summer crop, at\r\nwhich time the winter crop will be fit for digging; in which\r\nprocess every care should be taken to prevent their being\r\nbruised; and if possible they should be dug in cloudy weather, to\r\navoid exposure to the sun, which would rot them; whereas if\r\ncarefully preserved they will keep sound for a length of time;\r\nwhich will be the more desirable, as at this season vegetables\r\nare mostly scarce and dear.\r\n\r\nIn August the planting should be made, or even in September,\r\nif necessary; and at the end of the latter, or in October, they\r\nwill require to be hilled and earthed, and well cleansed from\r\nweeds, which must also now and then be done as weeds make their\r\nappearance. In the choice of seed for this crop, a middle sized\r\npotatoe should be preferred, without any objection to their being\r\ncut, as is the customary mode of planting.\r\n\r\n_Manure_.--Fresh stable dung, and litter, or decayed\r\nthatch, answers better for manure than that which is very rotten;\r\nbut if the ground be fresh and light, they will want no manure,\r\nand the potatoes be of a better quality, though probably less\r\nplentiful.\r\n\r\nIn October you may also plant potatoes for a latter crop; and\r\nthis, though perhaps less abundant than that sown in August or\r\nthe beginning of September, will nevertheless be sufficiently\r\nproductive to pay well the expence and labour of planting.\r\n\r\nThe potatoe is so essential and desirable an article of food,\r\nthat too much care cannot be bestowed in their culture and\r\npreservation; for should other crops fall short, this will afford\r\nthe grower a certain means of supporting his family.\r\n\r\nCarrots and Parsnips\r\n\r\nFor a general crop, may be best sown in December and January.\r\nThe ground should be dug deep, and broke up very fine. If the\r\nsoil be light, the seed should be sown on a calm day, and trod\r\nin.\r\n\r\n_Carrots_ and _Parsnips_ may also be planted in\r\nJuly, and also in November. They thrive best in an open\r\nsituation, or a light sandy soil; and after they come up, should\r\nbe thinned and set out with a small two inch garden hoe.\r\n\r\nCabbages\r\n\r\nFor a constant supply may be sown in January, April, May,\r\nJuly, August, October, and early in November, at a time when the\r\nground is in a moist state. The plants sown in April will not run\r\nto seed. Care should be taken to set out the plants in a richer\r\nand stronger ground than the bed they are taken from; otherwise\r\nthe crop will be poor. Their first bed should now and then be\r\nweeded with the hand, in dry weather, and the freshest and\r\nstrongest plants removed first. In setting them out, a passage\r\nshould be allowed between the rows of at least two feet, and in\r\nthe rows the plants kept eighteen or twenty inches distant from\r\neach other, which will allow them a free circulation of air. As\r\nthey grow up, they should occasionally be earthed up a little,\r\nand carefully weeded, as nothing has a more negligent and\r\nslovenly appearance than a foul bed of cabbage. In very dry hot\r\nweather, their first bed should be watered now and then; after\r\nrain they should be set out, but not during its continuance, as\r\nit would wash the mould from the roots, and numbers decay without\r\ntaking root at all in the new bed. Cabbages run to seed in August\r\nand September.\r\n\r\nA gardener of long experience in the Colony has favored us\r\nwith the following remarks on the culture of the cabbage:\r\n\"Although cabbage seed may be here sown with advantage at several\r\ntimes of the year, yet I have of late years confined myself to\r\ntwo sowings only; namely, in January, and as near the middle of\r\nMay as I could find the weather most favorable, for two general\r\ncrops. That sown in January comes well in for a winter supply;\r\nbut must be taken great care of, or will come to nothing; for as\r\nJanuary is one of our hottest months, they will require to be\r\nshaded from the sun's excessive heat by boughs, which if closely\r\ntwined together will continue their shelter even after the leaves\r\nare withered; and also, to be watered at least once in every two\r\nor three days, until they get pretty strong in the ground. The\r\nother crop, sown in May, will come into use early in summer; and\r\ndo not require any care more than they usually receive.\"\r\n\r\nTurnips\r\n\r\nThe ground should be prepared in February; and at the latter\r\nend of the month some may be planted; for which purpose gentle\r\nshowery weather is most favourable.\r\n\r\nTurnips for a general crop should be sown early in March, and\r\nthey will be ready for food for sheep in the beginning of May.\r\nDuring their growth they require hoeing once or twice, to thin\r\nand keep them clean, if the land be foul.\r\n\r\nTurnips for table use may be sown at any time between March\r\nand September, or the beginning of November, when absolutely\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n_Turnips for Sheep_.--The ground should be prepared in\r\nJanuary and February, by the plough or hoe, harrowing, manuring,\r\nand totally cleansing it from all weeds whatever, so that it be\r\nbrought into the best state possible.\r\n\r\n_The Seed_.--To raise turnip seed properly is an object\r\nworthy of the strictest attention. To do this, the bed should be\r\nexamined carefully when the turnips have attained about a third\r\nof their size, and the largest, smoothest, and most healthy taken\r\nup and transplanted into a richer bed, in rows a foot wide, and\r\nabout six inches between the plants that are in the same\r\nrow.--The seed will be fit to cut the latter end of November.\r\n\r\nCauliflower.\r\n\r\nThe seed may be sown at any time between November and\r\nFebruary; but best in December. Some sow about the middle of May\r\nfor a summer crop, and this practice is found to answer.\r\n\r\nAsparagus.\r\n\r\nThe seed should be sown in October, in drills, four drills in\r\na bed four feet wide, the ground being first well prepared, and\r\nrichly manured. At the latter end of April, or beginning of May,\r\nthe haulm should be cut down within two inches of the bed (though\r\nsome cut it nearly level), and constantly kept from weeds. The\r\nground should be dug with a three pronged fork, and not with a\r\nspade, as the latter will cut the crown of the roots, and destroy\r\nthe plants. A professed gardener of twenty-three years practice\r\nin the colony assures us, that he has now a bed of twenty years\r\nstanding, which constantly yielded a good crop until the year\r\nbefore last, the failure of which he attributed to the ground\r\nbeing worn out, and therefore set out a fresh bed. In this\r\ncountry it requires a cool soil, and that the beds should not be\r\nlaid too high, four or five inches being a sufficient height.\r\n\r\nOnions.\r\n\r\nIn March prepare the ground, by breaking it up well, and\r\nrichly manuring it. At the end of the month, and beginning of\r\nApril, sow for a light crop of onions for immediate use.\r\n\r\nIn April prepare for a general crop, which should be sown at\r\nthe latter end of the month, or beginning of May, to keep them\r\nfrom going to seed. When they grow to a proper size, which will\r\nbe from the latter end of October to the beginning of November,\r\nthey should be carefully laid down, so as not to break the tops;\r\nfor should the tops be broke, and the wet penetrate, the onions\r\nwill inevitably spoil. When fit to draw, they should be gathered\r\non a fine dry day, and lain under cover, so as not to be at all\r\nexposed to the sun.\r\n\r\nPease and Beans of all kinds.\r\n\r\nThe ground should be prepared in March, by well working and\r\nmanuring; and at the end of the month, and in April, they may be\r\nsown for a spring crop. Some sow from the beginning of March till\r\nthe middle of June, as occasion may require.\r\n\r\nPrepare in August for a latter crop; and\r\n\r\nFrench beans may be as well sown in October as at any other\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nCucumbers, Pumpkins, and Melons.\r\n\r\nThe ground should be got ready for these in August, and they\r\nshould be sown in September.\r\n\r\nRadishes.\r\n\r\nMay be sown when turnips are sown.\r\n\r\nLettuces and Small Sallad\r\n\r\nAre sown every month, for a constant supply; but lettuces are\r\nbest sown in April and November, and small sallads in May, and\r\nthe latter end of November.\r\n\r\nGrass and Clover.\r\n\r\nTurnip ground, on which either is intended to be sown, should\r\nbe cleared, cleaned, and broke up in August, great care being\r\ntaken to leave no weeds or large clods.\r\n\r\nSpinage\r\n\r\nIs best sown in March and September.\r\n\r\nBrocoli, brown and white\r\n\r\nShould be sown the beginning of January, and treated as\r\ncabbage sown at that time. Some observe the practice of sowing\r\nfrom November until February, but this is a vague method, and not\r\nto be depended on.\r\n\r\nStrawberries.\r\n\r\nMarch is the proper season for planting this fruit. The\r\nrunners and leaves should be all cut close away before they are\r\nset, which will strengthen them greatly, and before winter they\r\nwill have new leaves. If planted in clumps, the fruit will be\r\nlarger than if suffered to run over the bed; but by the latter\r\nmethod they preserve a more delicate appearance, and are\r\ncertainly less likely to contract filth.\r\n\r\nAs soon as planted, a sprinkling of fresh earth should be\r\nthrown over the beds, which should be plentifully watered twice\r\nor thrice a week, if the season turn out dry; and as the plants\r\nrequire much air, they should be thinned, in order to preserve a\r\nfree circulation.\r\n\r\nWhen sown in beds, the following mode of treatment should be\r\nobserved:--When the bed is well prepared, plant the rows of the\r\nlarge kinds, such as the Chili and Carolina, two feet apart, and\r\nallow one foot between each of the plants in the same row. The\r\nsmaller kinds do not require so much space; eighteen inches\r\nbetween the rows, and eighteen between the plants will be\r\nsufficient; but as much greater space may be given as the ground\r\nwill admit of.\r\n\r\nIn April all strawberry beds should be well dressed and\r\ncleaned, in order to prevent the lodging of insects; and in July\r\nthey should be gone well over, and have their spring dressing; in\r\ndoing which the runners must be taken off from the plants, and\r\nthe weeds cleared away. The ground will then also require to be\r\nloosened, and would be much benefited by a layer of fine manure\r\nand fresh earth between the rows, as this treatment will\r\nstrengthen the plants, and produce the largest and finest\r\nfruit.\r\n\r\nRaspberries\r\n\r\nShould also be dressed and cleaned in July.\r\n\r\nGrapes.\r\n\r\nBegin in April to pinch and prune the vines, which must be\r\ncleaned from all cankered and unhealthy leaves or other\r\nsubstances, to preserve them from insects. In July they should\r\nalso be gone over, and pruned and nailed, where requisite. All\r\nwalls and stakes should then be attentively examined, to prevent\r\nthe harbouring of insects, which will otherwise destroy the young\r\nwood and fruit.\r\n\r\nPine Apples.\r\n\r\nIn the management of Pinery, should gentlemen incline their\r\nattention thitherward, the following observances will be useful.\r\nIn May let them be unplunged, and lain down on their sides, till\r\nall their leaves be free from water. Take off all yellow leaves,\r\nand suckers, and let these suckers be plunged into fresh pots of\r\nearth, and in a fresh bed of heat, by means whereof the Pinery\r\nwill always be kept full. The spider is their chief enemy, and\r\ntherefore should not be permitted to harbour near them, as the\r\nsmallest of the tribe will kill the crown, and destroy the\r\nfruit.\r\n\r\nTrees of all Kinds\r\n\r\nIn JANUARY and FEBRUARY should be BUDDED. A competent judge\r\nwill best inform himself of the proper time for this operation by\r\nthe ripe appearance of the buds themselves. For this use the\r\npractical gardener chooses a small instrument which may be made\r\nof bone, with wrappers of worsted, which being elastic, is better\r\nthan bark, or any other substitute. The tops of the budded stocks\r\nare by some left uncut until the August or September following;\r\nbut a gardener of much experience in the Colony makes it a rule\r\nto cut his tops off immediately, as the buds strike much sooner\r\nwith this practice.\r\n\r\nPEACHES and PLUMS are best budded upon their own stocks.\r\n\r\nAPRICOTS may be budded upon peach stocks.\r\n\r\nThe ENGLISH MULBERRY upon the cherry; or Cape; and ORANGES\r\nwill succeed best upon lemons; and all tender trees are better to\r\nbe budded in summer than in spring.\r\n\r\nIt may be here proper to observe, for the better information\r\nof those who have not given themselves the trouble of dividing\r\nthe year into seasons, and which it would indeed be difficult to\r\ndo by a comparison with those to which in Europe we were\r\naccustomed, that the spring months are, _September,\r\nOctober_, and _November_; the summer months, _December,\r\nJanuary_, and _February_; the autumn months, _March,\r\nApril_, and _May_; and the winter months, _June,\r\nJuly_, and _August_. Hence it is observable, that our\r\nwheat harvesting begins in the last of the spring months,\r\nNovember, and is entirely over before the end of summer.\r\n\r\nIn March, all fruit trees should be examined, and the broken\r\nor decayed limbs taken off.\r\n\r\nIn May, all fruit trees should be pruned, except evergreens,\r\nand such branches as are necessary to be taken off cut close to\r\nthe tree, that the wound may heal the sooner, and thus prevent\r\nthe tree from injury by rain or dew.\r\n\r\nIn May, orange trees may be safely transplanted, as well as\r\nin\r\n\r\nJune; which is the general season for transplanting fruit\r\ntrees: in doing which, the roots should be carefully taken up,\r\nand planted as near to the surface as possible, taking care at\r\nthe same time that the whole be covered, being first spread out\r\nlike an open hand; after which the covering may be thickened with\r\na little rich manure; and when the hole is filled, the earth\r\nabout the root should be trodden gently, so as to fix the\r\nposition of the plant.\r\n\r\nJune is also the best time for making layers, and planting\r\ncuttings from hardy trees.\r\n\r\nIn July, such fruit trees as were not transplanted in June\r\nshould be removed, and stocks to bud and graft upon\r\ntransplanted.\r\n\r\nIn August, evergreens may be transplanted, in which great care\r\nmust be observed, as they are very tender; and as their roots\r\nwill not bear exposure to the sun, they must be so carefully dug\r\nround as to admit their being taken up with as large a ball of\r\nearth clinging to the root as can be done, in which exact state\r\nthey always should be fresh planted.\r\n\r\nIn August, also, the nursery will require to be well gone over\r\nand cleaned, and young trees prepared for grafting. Wall fruit\r\nand shrubs must be now particularly attended to, in divesting\r\nthem of every foul or decayed substance.\r\n\r\nIn this month, also, all gardens should be cleaned and\r\ndressed. The gardener ought to be particularly attentive in\r\nkeeping off weeds and insects, as grubs frequently make their\r\nappearance at this time, which very much injure all vegetable\r\nproductions.\r\n\r\nThis month also the nursery wants cleaning, and the young\r\ntrees must be prepared for grafting: the weeds preparatory to\r\nwhich, must be cut down and destroyed, or they will afterwards\r\ngive much trouble. Decayed branches should likewise be taken from\r\nfruit trees; and such trees as appear stunted should have the\r\nground opened about the roots.\r\n\r\nSEPTEMBER is a good month for grafting fruit trees, the scions\r\nintended for grafts being cut off a fortnight or three weeks\r\nbefore, and the ends which are cut stuck in the ground until\r\nwanted for use.\r\n\r\nTrees budded at the beginning of the year must now be cut down\r\nwithin about two inches of the bud; this space above the bud\r\nbeing left to tie the young shoots to, to prevent their being\r\nbroken off by the wind. No shoots should be suffered to grow but\r\nthe eye that was budded, and all others should be rubbed off as\r\nsoon as they appear.\r\n\r\nOCTOBER.--Young trees that were grafted in September should\r\nnow be examined, and all the young shoots broken off, but one or\r\ntwo, both from the grafts and stocks:--The clay must be taken\r\noff, and the bandages loosened. The ground between the rows of\r\nall young trees should also be kept clear of weeds, or they will\r\ndeprive the trees of a great part of their nourishment.\r\n\r\nApricot and peach trees should be examined this month, and\r\nwhere the fruit appears to be set too thick, which will be mostly\r\nthe case in prolific seasons, they must be reduced to a moderate\r\nquantity. This must nevertheless be done with care, and only such\r\nof the fruit as is proper to remain left upon the tree.\r\n\r\nIn this month the garden should be cleaned all through, and\r\nwalls and fruit trees well examined, to prevent insects from\r\nlodging.\r\n\r\nIn NOVEMBER such trees as were inoculated the previous summer\r\nwill want the young shoots tying, either to the top of the stock,\r\nor to have a stake driven in near them to tie the shoot to, that\r\nthey may not be broken off by the wind. All budded and grafted\r\ntrees will in November want constant attention. All shoots that\r\ndo not grow from the eye of the bud, or from the graft, must be\r\ntaken off, that the graft or bud may receive all the nourishment\r\nthe stock can afford.\r\n\r\nIn November evergreens may be propagated by layers, from the\r\nyoung shoots of the summer's growth.\r\n\r\nIn December the same observance is to be attended to with\r\nrespect to evergreens; and peach trees should now be thinned of\r\ntheir fruit, where it appears too thick.\r\n\r\n_Observations on some particular Fruit Trees_.\r\n\r\nThe Orange.\r\n\r\nIn pruning, the knife should be as little used as possible, if\r\nyou wish them to bear. The southerly winds are very unfavorable\r\nto their growth, and parts opened by the knife admit the air, and\r\nkill the bloom. This tree is perhaps more infested by ants than\r\nany other; and the black contracted appearance of the leaves is\r\nmuch attributed to this insect. From this persuasion, which is\r\npretty general, various methods have been tried to keep them off.\r\nHuman ordure laid round the boll of the tree will prevent their\r\nappearing so long as it retains moisture, but not longer; tar has\r\nbeen applied round both the trunk and branches, and only answered\r\nwhile moist; yet a cure, if the ant be really inimical, is\r\ncertain to be found, with little trouble, and without expence, in\r\ncommon suds from a wash tub, in which ley has been used. This\r\nwash should be laid well about the roots in the evening, when the\r\nants have left the tree, which will be mostly the case, and in\r\nwet weather always so, and there need be little apprehension of\r\ntheir return next morning; a woollen bandage, dipped in oil, will\r\nalso be found a preventative to their ascending the tree. This\r\napplication, whenever ants appear, will have the desired effect;\r\nbut whether these insects are injurious to the tree or not, is to\r\nbe doubted upon this principle, namely, that the ant, being\r\nexcessively carnivorous, is instinctively led to the orange tree\r\nin quest of the eggs, exuviae, larvae, etc. of some very minute\r\ninsect, whose eggs are attached to the leaves by a glutinous\r\nsubstance, emitted by themselves in such quantity as to discolour\r\nthe leaf, the pores of which being thus stopped, it becomes hard\r\nand tusky, and gradually closes. It seems impossible that this\r\nchange should be produced by the ant: for if it even attacked or\r\ndestroyed the blossom, this would not affect the leaves when the\r\ntree is not in bloom; and therefore it is rational to conclude\r\nthat their changed appearance proceeds from some other cause,\r\nperhaps from some other insect, perhaps from the assaults of the\r\nweather, or some peculiarity in its soil or situation, or from a\r\ncombination of these and other causes; in exemplification whereof\r\nit is worthy to be remarked, that a gardener in the Brickfields\r\nplanted a number of seed sixteen years ago, all from the same\r\ntree; of which forty-four came up, and were all treated with\r\nequal care. None shewed fruit until about seven years since; when\r\none produced about two-hundred oranges, and four or five others\r\nhad from thirty down to ten or a dozen each. The following year\r\nthe same trees were full; and afterwards others began to bear.\r\nThis very great disparity in their time of bearing, keeping in\r\nmind at the same time that the seeds were from the same tree, all\r\nsown at once, and all equally well attended to, would be\r\nsufficient to excite astonishment, were we not to make allowance\r\nfor the various causes that might have tended to accelerate or\r\nretard their growth.\r\n\r\nThe gardener himself says, that the chief of the defaulters\r\nwere a good deal shaded from the sun by a range of peach trees,\r\nwhich depriving them of a great proportion of the warmth\r\nnecessary to a fruit which thrives best in the hottest climates,\r\nhe considers sufficient to occasion all the difference spoken\r\nof.\r\n\r\nThe Apple\r\n\r\nHas a great enemy in a minute insect called the Cochineal,\r\nowing more, perhaps, to its being nearly of the same colour, than\r\nfrom any resemblance to the Spanish insect of that name. A\r\ngentleman who had eight trees that had for several years borne a\r\ndelicious apple, had the mortification to find the whole of his\r\ntrees at once infested by those insects in excessive number;\r\nafter which they left off bearing, and after failing in many\r\nexperiments to relieve them, he came unwillingly to the\r\nresolution of cutting down the trees. These insects are of a dark\r\nred, approaching to a purple, and combine in such numbers on the\r\nroots as well as branches, as to shew in protuberated clusters,\r\nexhibiting a downy whiteness on the surface. A gardener of the\r\ncolony, who has attended a good deal to this matter, affirms that\r\na weed called the Churnwort presents a perfect remedy to the\r\ndisaster; with this weed, the roots, cleared of the earth, and\r\nthe branches also, he advises to be thoroughly well rubbed.\r\n\r\n[TABLE: VICTUALLING ONE MESS OF FIVE MEN.]\r\n[Table not included in this text version--see html version.
