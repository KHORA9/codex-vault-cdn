Throughout his book he has revealed\r\n        that plutocracy in its true light and shown it to\r\n        be something utterly conscienceless and debased.\r\n        No more scathing review of the situation, as it is\r\n        seen at present, could possibly be given in a work\r\n        of fiction.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                     =SHALL WE\r\n                            HAVE A\r\n                                KING?=\r\n\r\n          Will the United States be a monarchy in 1975?\r\n        Have you read “THE FIRST AMERICAN KING,” by George\r\n        Gordon Hastings? It is a dashing romance in which\r\n        a scientist and a detective of today wake up\r\n        seventy-five years later to find His Majesty,\r\n        Imperial and Royal, William I, Emperor of the\r\n        United States and King of the Empire State of New\r\n        York, ruling the land, with the real power in the\r\n        hands of half a dozen huge trusts. Automobiles\r\n        have been replaced by phaërmobiles; air-ships sail\r\n        above the surface of the earth; there has been a\r\n        successful war against Russia; a social revolution\r\n        is brewing. The book is both an enthralling\r\n        romance and a serious sociological study, which\r\n        scourges unmercifully the society and politics of\r\n        the present time, many of whose brightest stars\r\n        reappear in the future under thinly disguised\r\n        names. There are wit and humor and sarcasm\r\n        galore—a stirring tale of adventure and a charming\r\n        love-story.\r\n\r\n                 Net $1.00, postpaid.

MARCH, 1905         No. 1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _The Political Situation_\r\n\r\n\r\n                          BY THOMAS E. WATSON\r\n\r\nCarefully studied, the election of Nov. 8, 1904, affords more\r\nencouragement to Reformers than any event which has happened since the\r\nCivil War.\r\n\r\nIn smashing the fraudulent scheme of Gorman-Hill-McCarren-Belmont, the\r\npeople proved that there was still such a thing as public conscience.\r\nThe whole Parker campaign was rotten—from inception to final\r\nfiasco—and the manner in which the masses rose and stamped the life\r\nout of it was profoundly refreshing. Roosevelt stood for many things\r\nwhich the people did not like, but they recognized in him a man instead\r\nof a myth, a reality instead of a sham.\r\n\r\nHe had fought abuses in civil life; he had fought the enemies of his\r\ncountry on the battlefield; he had achieved literary success; he had\r\nbeen a worker and a fighter all his days. He had faced the coal barons\r\nand virtually brought them to terms; he had bearded the railroad kings\r\nand broken up the Northern Securities Combine. Thus, while he “stood\r\npat” on many things which the people detested, he stood likewise for\r\nmany things they admired, and they gave him a vote larger than that of\r\nhis party.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnother thing helped Roosevelt. This was the prominence of Grover\r\nCleveland and his “second administration” gang. Apparently Parker had\r\nno conception of the bitterness with which the masses hate Cleveland.\r\nBecause he was cheered by the self-chosen delegates to the St. Louis\r\nconvention, because he was given a cut-and-dried ovation by the\r\nbusiness men of New York City, the Democratic bosses seemed to believe\r\nthat the more of Cleveland they forced into the campaign the better the\r\ncountry would like the taste of it.\r\n\r\nSo they not only kept Cleveland on exhibition in the most conspicuous\r\nmanner, but they dug up John G. Carlisle, Arthur Pue Gorman, Olney\r\nof Massachusetts, and other Cleveland fossils, until Parker’s\r\nidentification with Cleveland’s second administration was complete.\r\n\r\nAnd when _that_ happened, it was “Good-bye Parker!”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCleveland had issued the bonds which Harrison had refused to issue; he\r\nhad sold $62,000,000 of these bonds at private sale, _at midnight_, to\r\nJ. P. Morgan and his associates; _the price was less than that which\r\nthe negroes of Jamaica were getting for their bonds!_\r\n\r\nAugust Belmont was Morgan’s partner in that infamous deal. Therefore,\r\nwhen Cleveland and Belmont got so close to Parker that he couldn’t\r\nbreathe without touching them on either side, the suspicion became\r\nviolent that the same Wall Street influences which had pledged\r\nCleveland to a bond issue had pledged Parker to the same thing.\r\n\r\n_There is no reasonable doubt whatever that Parker’s managers had\r\npledged themselves to another issue of bonds._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHow could these bonds have been issued? Easy enough. Cleveland had\r\ninvented the process by violating the law; and the Cleveland precedent\r\nstill stands.\r\n\r\nTo get more bonds, you only need another President who will take orders\r\nfrom Belmont and Morgan at secret, midnight conferences.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThen there was John G. Carlisle. Among political shrubs which are\r\naromatic, none smells sweeter than he. Not by any other name would he\r\nsmell half so sweet. Carlisle was the Whisky Trust representative in\r\nCongress, who made so many speeches for Free Silver and Tariff Reform.\r\nPlaced in Cleveland’s cabinet he crawled at the feet of the gold-bugs,\r\nand he wrote a new tariff for the Sugar Trust, which enabled those\r\nrobbers to take annual millions from the people in repayment for the\r\nthousands which the Trust had put into the Democratic Campaign fund.\r\n\r\nThis man, Carlisle, was exhumed and brought to New York to make another\r\nspeech for “Reform” and for Parker!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLikewise there was Gorman. With a political ignorance which is hard\r\nto understand, Parker seemed to believe that his salvation depended\r\nupon linking himself to Gorman. He appeared to breathe easy only when\r\nsitting in the lap of Gorman. Nothing in the way of campaign plan could\r\nbe sent forth into the world with any hope of success until there\r\nhad been a laying-on of hands and a blessing by the cloud-compelling\r\nGorman. Yet it would seem that a well-informed schoolboy should have\r\nbeen able to tell Parker that Gorman was one of the best hated men\r\nliving.\r\n\r\nWhen poor people were freezing in the big cities and the Coal Trust was\r\npitiless, and the golden-hearted Senator Vest of Missouri proposed to\r\ncut the ground from under the feet of the Trust by putting coal upon\r\nthe Free List, who was it that virtually said in the United States\r\nSenate, “Let the people freeze; the Trust shall not be weakened”?\r\n\r\n_It was Gorman, of Maryland!_\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWho was it that took the Tariff Reform Measure of Wm. L. Wilson and\r\nturned it into an elaborate device for enriching the few at the expense\r\nof the many?\r\n\r\nIt was Gorman.\r\n\r\nWho took Sugar off the Free List and put a tax of $45,000,000 upon it?\r\n\r\nGorman.\r\n\r\nWho increased the McKinley duties upon lumber and nails and wire and\r\ntrace-chains and horseshoes and iron-ware which the common people must\r\nuse?\r\n\r\nGorman.\r\n\r\nWho doubled the tax on molasses?\r\n\r\nGorman.\r\n\r\nWho stands upon the Democratic side in the Senate of the United States\r\nas the champion of the Sugar Trust and all other Democratic Trusts?\r\n\r\nGorman.\r\n\r\nBut Parker could never get enough of Gorman. The people could—and did.\r\nTheir votes showed that they wanted no more tariff bills fixed by\r\n\r\nGorman.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhy was the election encouraging to reformers?\r\n\r\nBecause it showed such an increase in the independent vote.\r\n\r\nAt least a million Independents voted for Roosevelt because they were\r\nhell-bent on beating Parker. In part, they were moved to do this\r\nbecause of the belief that Roosevelt himself leans to radicalism. His\r\npast record as a reformer gave hope that during the next four years he\r\nwould be a powerful factor in bringing about improved conditions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nReformers not only take encouragement from Parker’s loss of votes, but\r\nin the victories won by Douglas, La Follette and Folk.\r\n\r\nWidely separated as were the States of Massachusetts, Wisconsin and\r\nMissouri the fact that the independent voter broke party lines in each\r\nof these States to support a genuine reformer is the most significant\r\nfact among the election results.\r\n\r\nNo one can misunderstand it. The people want honest leaders. The people\r\nwill follow without flinching. Party names count for nothing. Give the\r\npeople a MAN: fearless, honest, aggressive, _standing for something_,\r\nand not afraid to fight for it: the people will follow him to the death.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe too often say, “The people are fickle; they won’t stand by their own\r\nleaders!” Ah, friend! Think how often the people have been fooled. See\r\nhow many men they have put into office to accomplish reforms. See how\r\noften these leaders have forgotten their pledges as soon as they began\r\nto draw salaries, free passes and perquisites!\r\n\r\nThe people have been betrayed so often that they are discouraged. But\r\ndon’t you doubt this, brother: Another reform wave is coming, and woe\r\nunto those leaders who seek to check it!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHere is the condition of the Democratic Party:\r\n\r\nFor four years it is bound to the St. Louis platform, plus Parker’s\r\ngold telegram, plus Parker’s message to Roosevelt “heartily”\r\ncongratulating him upon his election.\r\n\r\nFor four years Belmont, McCarren, Meyer, Dave Hill, Gorman & Co. have\r\nabsolute control of the party machinery.\r\n\r\nFor four years the official commander-in-chief, the standard-bearer of\r\nNational Democracy is Tom Taggart, the gambling-hell man of French Lick\r\nSprings, Indiana!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCommenting upon the campaign, _The Independent_, of New York, says that\r\nMr. Bryan gave his support to the Democratic ticket, but took back\r\nnothing which he had said about Parker. _The Independent_ is mistaken.\r\nBryan changed his position so often and so fast that Dr. Holt evidently\r\nfailed to keep up.\r\n\r\nIn that special-car trip of his through Indiana, Mr. Bryan’s\r\nevolutionary process developed him into a Parker champion, who saw in\r\nthe Esopus man “The Moses of Democracy,” one whose “ideals” were the\r\nsame as Bryan’s “ideals,” one whose candidacy enlisted Bryan’s support\r\nas cordially as though Bryan “had framed the platform and selected the\r\nnominee.” Oh, yes, that was about what he said, Dr. Holt.\r\n\r\nAnd when he had finished saying it twenty-two times per day, the\r\nIndiana voter girded up his trousers, trekked to the polls, and voted\r\nfor Roosevelt.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To W. J. B._\r\n\r\nWould you be so kind as to tell us when and where you will commence to\r\nreorganize the Democratic party? You promised to begin “immediately\r\nafter the election.” What is your construction of the word\r\n“immediately”? And what did you really mean by “reorganize”?\r\n\r\nYour party is fully organized from top to bottom—from Tom Taggart, the\r\ngambling-hell man, down to Pat McCarren, the Standard Oil lobbyist. How\r\ncan you reorganize a party so thoroughly organized? You can’t do it,\r\nyou are not trying to do it, and you must have known all along that you\r\ncouldn’t do it.\r\n\r\nWatch out, William! The people have loved you and believed in you, but\r\nyour course in the last campaign has shaken your popularity to its\r\nvery foundations. Beware how you trifle with the radicals. If you want\r\nto come with us, come and be done with it. If you want to go to the\r\nBelmonts and Taggarts, go and be done with it.\r\n\r\nBe assured of this, William—_you can’t ride both horses_!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To President Roosevelt_\r\n\r\nThe people have given you power and opportunity. For four years you will\r\nhave a responsibility such as few men have ever had.\r\n\r\n_What Will You Do With It?_\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Express Companies are robbing the people of many millions of\r\ndollars every year in excessive charges for carrying small parcels. In\r\nevery civilized land, save ours, the Government carries these small\r\nparcels at a nominal cost, as a part of the postal service.\r\n\r\nIn America, a venal Congress keeps the yoke of the Express Companies\r\nfastened upon the people and will not allow the government to establish\r\na Parcels Post. Mr. President, will you not fix your attention upon\r\nthis monstrous abuse? Will you not come into the arena and help us in\r\nthe fight for the Parcels Post?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. President, the railroads are charging the government $65,000,000\r\nper year for carrying our mails! This represents a yearly income of\r\nmore than two per cent. upon three billion dollars.\r\n\r\nSqueeze out the water, and the railroads of the United States could be\r\nbought for three billion dollars.\r\n\r\n_Therefore, on the carriage of mails alone, your administration is\r\npaying the railroads more than two per cent. upon their entire value!_\r\n\r\nThe Government could float a two per cent. bond at par, and if it\r\nissued enough bonds to pay for all the roads the annual interest charge\r\nwould be no greater than we now pay for carrying the mails.\r\n\r\nCan you do nothing about this, Mr. President? Is your strong arm\r\npowerless to defend the people against this high-handed robbery?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. President, your administration is now paying the Oceanic Steamship\r\nCompany $45,000 per year to carry mails to the semi-savages of Tahiti.\r\nThis island is under French control. French steamers offered to carry\r\nthese mails for $400 per year. Your administration refused the offer,\r\nand continued to pay an American Corporation $45,000. _Did you know\r\nthis, Mr. President? Is there nothing you can do about it? Must the\r\ntaxpayers be plundered of $44,600 every year simply because an American\r\nCorporation wants the money?_\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. President, is it right that to China and Japan American-made cloth\r\nshould be sold cheaper than we Americans can buy it? Is it right that\r\nwe should have to pay more for implements to work our fields with than\r\nthe South American farmer pays for the same tools? For a hundred years\r\nour manufacturers have been protected from foreign competition in the\r\nhome market; they charge us higher prices in this home market than are\r\npaid by any other people on earth; they organize this monopoly into a\r\nTrust, and then they take their surplus goods into foreign markets and\r\nsell them to foreigners at a lower price than they sell to us. Is that\r\nright, Mr. President?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHow can this evil be corrected? How can the Trusts be curbed?\r\n\r\nBy putting on the Free List every article which is sold abroad cheaper\r\nthan it is sold here, and every article which enters into the necessary\r\nmakeup of the Trust.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. President, under your administration corporate wealth escapes\r\nnational taxation, as it has done for the past thirty years.\r\n\r\n_Under Abraham Lincoln, the railroads and the manufacturers paid a\r\nfederal tax._\r\n\r\nThey pay none now.\r\n\r\n_Under Abraham Lincoln, the vastly overgrown Insurance Companies and\r\nExpress Companies paid a federal tax._\r\n\r\nThey pay none now.\r\n\r\nIs that right, Mr. President?\r\n\r\nWhy should the poorest mechanic, clerk, storekeeper, printer, farmer,\r\nor mine-worker _pay excessive federal taxes upon the necessaries of\r\nlife while the billion dollar corporations pay nothing at all_?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Ship Subsidy_\r\n\r\nIn his message to Congress the President says:\r\n\r\n“I especially commend to your immediate attention the encouragement of\r\nour merchant marine by appropriate legislation.”\r\n\r\nDoes Mr. Roosevelt, like the late Senator Hanna, favor the Ship\r\nSubsidy? Is the government going to hire merchants to go to sea? Are we\r\nto have hothouse commerce sustained at the expense of the taxpayers?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhat ails our merchant marine? Why cannot American merchants compete\r\nwith British and German merchants on the ocean?\r\n\r\nSimply because our own laws will not allow it. Our navigation acts have\r\ndestroyed the American merchant marine.\r\n\r\nHow?\r\n\r\nBy denying registry and the protection of the flag to any ship not\r\nbuilt in one of our own shipyards. We are not allowed to buy vessels\r\nfrom England, Scotland or Germany without losing the protection of our\r\ngovernment. We must build them at home. Our precious tariff increases\r\nthe cost of all shipbuilding material, while in Great Britain vessels\r\nare built under free trade conditions. Hence it costs us more to\r\nbuild any sort of seagoing vessel than it costs Great Britain. If we\r\nwere allowed to buy ships abroad we could get them on equal terms\r\nwith British merchants. Consequently we could compete with them for\r\nthe carrying trade. We would get our share. The American Merchant\r\nMarine would once more flourish as it did prior to the Civil War. The\r\nTariff compels the merchant to pay more for an American ship than the\r\nEnglishman pays for an English ship, and our Navigation laws compel the\r\nAmerican merchant to use the American ship or none.\r\n\r\nResult: The Englishman gets the business.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was just this kind of legislation which provoked the preliminary\r\ntroubles between Great Britain and the American Colonies. Our\r\nforefathers hated the British navigation acts; the sons copied them.\r\nGreat Britain grew wise, swung to Free Trade, and took the seas away\r\nfrom us. Our navigation acts represent the most violent type of the\r\nProtective madness. To deny the merchant the right to buy his vessel\r\nwhere he can get it cheapest is mere lunacy. The cheapest and best\r\nships will inevitably get the cargoes; and where the law denies to the\r\nAmerican the chance to get the cheapest and best vessel it simply puts\r\nhim out of the combat.\r\n\r\nOur Navigation acts have done that identical thing.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhat is the remedy? Senator Hanna wanted “ship subsidies.” In other\r\nwords, the merchant was to be encouraged to go into the shipping\r\nbusiness by the assurance that the Government would go down into the\r\npockets of the taxpayers and pull out enough money to make good the\r\ndifference between the costly ships of America and the cheaper, better\r\nships of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nTo escape the effects of one bad law, Senator Hanna proposed that\r\nCongress should pass another. The Tariff, which plunders the many to\r\nenrich the few (see recent remarks of Parker and Cleveland), has killed\r\nthe merchant marine; therefore the merchant marine must be restored to\r\nlife, not at the expense of the enriched few, but of the plundered many.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe merchant marine has been destroyed by the system which is “the\r\nmother of the Trusts,” by the system which sells to foreign consumers\r\nat a lower price than to home consumers.\r\n\r\nWhy not encourage our merchant marine by allowing our merchants\r\n_to buy their vessels in those foreign markets where our Protected\r\nManufacturers sell their wares so much cheaper than they sell them to\r\nus at home_?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWould it not be the most shameless kind of class legislation to take the\r\ntax money of the unprivileged masses of our people (who pay practically\r\nall the taxes), and build up fortunes for another class of privileged\r\nshipowners.\r\n\r\nThe beneficiaries of protection are the few: its victims are the many.\r\n\r\nThus the favored few get all the benefits of protection and escape all\r\nits evils; while the unprivileged many bear all of its evils and reap\r\nnone of its benefits.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe are told that Great Britain and Germany subsidize their merchant\r\nmarine and that therefore our government must do it. The argument\r\nwould be contemptible even if the facts supported it, but that is not\r\nthe case. Great Britain does not subsidize her merchant marine nor\r\ndoes Germany do so. Great Britain pays certain lines for specific mail\r\nservice and colonial service; nothing more. Germany does likewise.\r\nNeither country _hires_ merchants to go to sea about their own business.\r\n\r\nThere is no more statesmanship in hiring a mariner to engage in private\r\nbusiness between New York and Liverpool than there would be in hiring\r\nJohn Wanamaker to establish another branch of his mercantile business\r\nin San Francisco or Terra Del Fuego. Such legislation as that is\r\n_Privilege run mad_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen Napoleon encouraged the beet sugar industry in France by bounties\r\nhe may have done a wise thing. France was under his despotic control;\r\ncommerce with the world was cut off; internal development became the\r\nlaw of self-preservation.\r\n\r\nBut no imperial sceptre rules the ocean. There can be no monopoly of\r\nthe use of her myriad highways. Amid her vast areas, natural law mocks\r\nthe puny contrivances of men. Competition is free. The ocean race is to\r\nthe swift; the battle is to the strong. Whoever can do the work, do it\r\nquickest, cheapest, surest, best, will do it—American bounties to the\r\ncontrary notwithstanding.\r\n\r\nTake off the rusty fetters which bind the limbs of the American seaman\r\nand he will need no bounty. Give him a fair start, an open course, and\r\nhe will outrun the world. Keep the chains on him—and he will never win!\r\n\r\nSuppose you give bounties to the shipper, then what? To the extent of\r\nthe bounty he will do business—no further. And you will soon find\r\nthat you have attracted mercenary corporations who do business for the\r\nbounty, the whole bounty, and nothing but the bounty.\r\n\r\nWe tried this ship subsidy business once before—from 1867 to 1877.\r\nWhat was the result? Scandals and failure. Congress took more than six\r\nand a half million dollars of the people’s money, gave it to greedy\r\ncorporations and got nothing in return save a fit of disappointment and\r\ndisgust which lasted the country till the advent of Hanna.\r\n\r\nWe earnestly hope that President Roosevelt will look into the record\r\nof the former subsidy experiment before he ever signs a bill of like\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1856 a little more than three-fourths of all our exports and imports\r\nwere carried in American bottoms. In 1881 seventy-two million bushels\r\nof grain were shipped from New York to Europe, and not one bushel of it\r\nwent in American ships.\r\n\r\nLess than one-sixth of our marine freight was handled by ourselves in\r\n1881, and the amount has gone on dwindling.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain improved her methods of building ships; built cheaper and\r\nbetter vessels than ours. The law did not permit us to buy from her,\r\nbut did permit her to bring her ships into our waters and capture our\r\ntrade; and so she captured it.\r\n\r\nWe are the only people in the world who are not allowed to buy ships\r\nwherever we can buy them cheapest. We are the only serfs alive who\r\nare chained hand and foot to obsolete Navigation laws. And to escape\r\nthe logical consequences of our folly we do not propose to repeal the\r\nmonstrous laws which led us into the difficulty, but we do propose to\r\ncompel the taxpayers to make good, by subsidies, the difference between\r\nthe costly American ship and the cheaper, better European ship!\r\n\r\nWhen statesmanship gets down to that low ebb its morality is gone.\r\n\r\nA venal Congress may pass such a measure, but we do not believe an\r\nhonest President will sign it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _Hearst, the Myth_\r\n\r\nBecause he is not perpetually making an exhibit of himself, a good many\r\nshallow politicians sneer at W. R. Hearst and call him a myth.\r\n\r\nBecause he is not everlastingly on his feet reeling off speeches which\r\ncome from nowhere and go nowhere, the average regulation “orator” looks\r\ndown upon the modest, silent man from New York as a very inferior\r\nmortal, indeed.\r\n\r\nYet W. R. Hearst, with all his shyness and silence, has a way of\r\nhitting out quick, hard and sure that does more good for the people\r\nthan all the “orators” have done in the last decade. If there is\r\nanything on this blessed earth that we have got enough of at this\r\ntime, it is talk, _talk_, TALK! From Presidents in fact and Presidents\r\nin prospectus, from Senators of all shades and Congressmen of every\r\nvariety down to oratorical Federal Judges, College Doctors and\r\nlegislative lights we have floods of talk, _talk_, TALK! The misery\r\nof it all is that this oratory doesn’t mean anything. It strikes a\r\nbee-line for the waste basket.\r\n\r\nIt lives today, echoes tomorrow, and is forgotten the day after. The\r\norator himself thinks only of the success of the speech. He drinks in\r\nthe immediate applause, he gloats over the newspaper puffs, he puts\r\nout his chest, he is happy: and that is all. The speech accomplishes\r\nnothing; was not meant to accomplish anything. Perhaps the orator\r\nhimself voted for the thing which he denounced, as happened with the\r\nPanama business when Democratic “orators” spoke on one side and voted\r\non the other. Now if there is anything which the American people are\r\nsick unto death of, it is this kind of patent-medicine oratory. What\r\nwe all want just now is that men shall become _workers_ instead of\r\nautomatic spellbinders. We want men who actually do something—men who\r\nhave ideas, plans, practical resources; men who will literally take\r\nup their clubs and hammer away at monstrous abuses wherever they show\r\ntheir heads.\r\n\r\nSuch a man is W. R. Hearst. By his assault upon the Coal Trust he has\r\nexposed the heartless methods of capitalism and laid the foundations\r\nfor much good work in the future. By his swift, successful attack upon\r\nthe Gas Trust, which, by the collusion of city officials, was about to\r\nsteal seven million dollars from the taxpayers of New York, he has set\r\nan example which should inspire every reformer in the Union.\r\n\r\nMay his courage become contagious! May his example breed imitations!\r\nMay his firmness in standing for the rights of the people raise up\r\nenemies to the Trusts throughout the land!\r\n\r\nMr. Hearst is a Democrat; the corrupt officials who were about to\r\nsurrender the treasury of New York to the Gas Trust were Democrats;\r\nthat fact did not bother him in the least. Rascality is doubly odious\r\nwhen it borrows a good name; and the honest Democrat did not hesitate\r\nto bring his injunction down like a flail upon the heads of the\r\ndishonest Democrats who were betraying their trust.\r\n\r\nWe wish we could swap a couple of hundred “orators” for another myth\r\nlike William R. Hearst.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  _Mr. Bryan’s Race in Nebraska_\r\n\r\nIn a recent issue of his paper, Mr. Bryan says, referring to Mr. Watson:\r\n\r\n        The small vote which he received—a vote much\r\n      smaller than Populists, Democrats, and even\r\n      Republicans expected him to receive—shows either\r\n      that there are few who agree with him as to the\r\n      course of action to be pursued or that they did\r\n      not have confidence in his leadership. It is not\r\n      only more charitable, but more in accordance with\r\n      the facts, to assume that the reformers had personal\r\n      confidence in Mr. Watson, but did not agree with\r\n      him as to the best method of securing remedial\r\n      legislation.\r\n\r\nThis paragraph reminds me that Mr. Bryan was likewise a candidate in\r\nthe year 1904.\r\n\r\nHe ran for the United States Senate in the State of Nebraska, and he\r\ngot no votes to speak of. Out of 133 members of the Legislature, he\r\ncaptured less than a dozen.\r\n\r\nThe small vote which he received—a vote much smaller than Populists,\r\nDemocrats and even Republicans expected him to receive—shows either\r\nthat there are few who agree with him as to the course of action to be\r\npursued, or that they did not have confidence in his leadership. “It is\r\nnot only more charitable, but”—and so forth.\r\n\r\nMr. Bryan says that “reforms are not to be secured all at once.” Quite\r\nright; and they will never be secured at all by leaders who change\r\nfront as often as Mr. Bryan has done within the last twelve months.\r\nNeither will they be secured by a political party which preaches a\r\ncertain creed for eight years and then throws it aside like a worn out\r\ngarment. Nor will reforms ever be secured by a party which contains\r\nso many different sorts of Democrats that nobody knows which is the\r\ngenuine variety.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   _Let the Greenbacks Alone!_\r\n\r\nTo the right, to the left, in front, in the rear, we are beset by\r\nproblems, abuses, critical conditions, wrongs crying for redress,\r\nvictims of legislative injustice demanding relief. That a President of\r\nthe United States should be blind to so many self-evident conditions,\r\ndeaf to so many sounds of suffering, and should go out of his way to\r\nstrike at the Greenback currency is a fact to cause astonishment.\r\n\r\nWhat harm is the Greenback doing to anybody? What evil has it ever\r\nwrought?\r\n\r\nThe approval of Lincoln gave it life; the soldier who fought for the\r\nUnion, when Roosevelt was in the cradle, was paid with it; the Union\r\narmies were fed and clothed with it when gold had run off and hid. The\r\nGreenback saved the Government in its hour of need, and it has done\r\ngood each day of its life ever since. If we had five times as much of\r\nit as now exists, the country would be twice as well off.\r\n\r\nWho is it that hates the Greenback?\r\n\r\nThe National Banker.\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\nBecause the National Banker would like to have the monopoly of\r\nsupplying the paper currency. The Government circulates $346,000,000\r\nGreenbacks; the National Banker circulates $400,000,000 of his own\r\nnotes.\r\n\r\nThe bank-notes earn compound interest for the banker; the Greenbacks\r\nearn no interest at all. Therefore, they compete with the notes of the\r\nbanker. They interfere with his business. As long as they exist, he has\r\nno absolute monopoly.\r\n\r\nTherefore what?\r\n\r\nThe National Banker hates the Greenback just as the Standard Oil\r\ndetests the independent companies. For the same reason which moves\r\nthe Coal Barons, the Beef Trust and the Tobacco Trust to wage\r\nrelentless war upon the independent dealer, the money power demands the\r\nsuppression of the Greenback. If the National Bankers can destroy the\r\nGreenback, they can fill its place with their own notes. Loaned out at\r\nlawful interest, compounded at the usual periods, they will wring from\r\nthe people a yearly tribute of nearly thirty million dollars. In other\r\nwords, the country now gets Greenbacks free of charge, whereas the\r\nbank-notes to replace them will cost $30,000,000 per annum. I can see\r\nhow this will benefit the bankers; but whom else will it benefit?\r\n\r\nOne of the strangest hallucinations that ever entered the legislative\r\nmind is that a banker’s note, based on national credit, is good, safe,\r\nsane currency, while the Government’s own note, based on national\r\ncredit, is unsafe, unsound and not to be tolerated. The first\r\nlegislators who saw the thing that way were probably hired to do it.\r\nThe example having been set, ignorance, prejudice and self-interest\r\nhelped to swell the numbers of the converts, until now the men who\r\ncling to the belief that a Government note, issued by the Government\r\nitself would be as good as that which it authorizes the banker to\r\nissue, are in a helpless minority.\r\n\r\nIf the Government buys paper, sets up a press, stamps a note and issues\r\nit as currency, the banker howls “_Rag Money_!” The subsidized editor\r\ntakes up the dismal refrain, the limber-kneed politician tunes his\r\nmouth to the echo, the wise men of the academy quit gerund-grinding to\r\ntalk finance, and with one accord the orthodox repeat the jeer of “_Rag\r\nMoney_,” “_Rag Baby_” and “_Dishonest Dollar_,” until the Government\r\nlets _the banker take the paper, the press, the stamp and issue the\r\nnotes as his own_! Then it is all right. The editor’s soul is soothed;\r\nthe politician purrs with satisfaction; the savant of the academy\r\nreturns to his Greeks and Romans. All is well. The bankers issue their\r\ncurrency, grow fat on usury, and the principles of high finance are\r\nvindicated. _The paper currency of the Government is a “Rag Baby”; the\r\npaper money of the National Banker is “Sound Money.”_\r\n\r\nSo, we let the bankers exploit a governmental function to their immense\r\nprofit, when the Government could use the function itself, to the\r\ninjury of nobody, and to the vast benefit of the people at large. But\r\nif the Government did this thing, the National Banker would lose his\r\nspecial privilege, his unjust advantage, his huge gains.\r\n\r\nHence, he not only refuses to permit the Government to supply the\r\ncountry with any more Greenbacks, but he demands the destruction of\r\nthose already outstanding. I regret to see President Roosevelt lending\r\nhimself to this wicked proposition.\r\n\r\nCleveland, during the whole time he was in office, was hostile to the\r\nGreenbacks and recommended that they be destroyed. Nobody was surprised\r\nat this. In fact, Cleveland had exhausted the capacity of honest men to\r\nbe surprised.\r\n\r\nBut the country hoped for better things from Mr. Roosevelt. He was\r\nthought to be too strong a man to be the blind tool of the National\r\nBankers.\r\n\r\nThe Greenback is hurting nobody, is doing great good; its only enemy\r\nis the National Banker, whose motive is sordidly selfish. LET THE\r\nGREENBACK ALONE!\r\n\r\nIf the President will take the trouble to study for himself the\r\nfinancial statements issued by his own subordinates, he will discover a\r\nstate of things which would otherwise be incredible.\r\n\r\nHe will find that _the bankers are drawing compound interest on more\r\nmoney than there is in existence_!\r\n\r\nHe will find that _they reap usurious revenues from three times as much\r\nmoney as there is in actual circulation_!\r\n\r\nHe will find that _they have drawn interest upon seven times as much\r\nmoney as_ THEY ACTUALLY HAVE!\r\n\r\nUnder the law of its birth, the Greenback is real money. Like gold\r\nand silver, it comes direct from the Government to the people. If you\r\nburn it, and do not supply its place, _you contract the currency at a\r\ntime when such contraction means national disaster_. If you burn the\r\nGreenback, and allow the National Banker to supply its place with his\r\nown notes, then _you rob the people of thirty million dollars annually\r\nand give the spoils to the banker_!\r\n\r\nHe already earns about $50,000,000 per year on his special privilege of\r\nissuing currency.\r\n\r\n_Isn’t that enough?_\r\n\r\nHe already enjoys the use of one hundred million dollars of the tax\r\nmoney which _other people pay into the treasury_; and he fattens on the\r\nluxury of getting this money free of interest and of lending it out at\r\ncompound interest to the “_other people_.”\r\n\r\n_Isn’t that enough?_\r\n\r\nAnd he has filled the channels of trade with his “lines of credit,” his\r\nloans of money which has no existence save in the confidence of his\r\ndupes, _until his yearly income from fictitious money is half as great\r\nas the entire revenues of the Government!_\r\n\r\nISN’T THAT ENOUGH?\r\n\r\nThe Greenback is the barrier which stands between the National Banker\r\nand absolute financial despotism.\r\n\r\nLET IT ALONE!\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _En Route to Royalty_\r\n\r\nThe approaching inauguration of President Roosevelt is to be the most\r\nking-like ceremony ever witnessed on the American Continent.\r\n\r\nThree thousand troops of the regular Army, twenty thousand soldiers of\r\nthe National Guard, the Cadets from West Point and Annapolis will take\r\npart in the parade, and battleships of the Navy will be ordered to the\r\nPotomac to add to the pompous function.\r\n\r\nFrom the White House to Capitol Hill, Pennsylvania avenue is to be\r\nbuilt up on either side with statuary and decorations and plaster work,\r\nwhich will at least wear the mask of regal magnificence.\r\n\r\nThe Government will turn its Pension Bureau out of house and home,\r\nsuspending public work, in order that Society’s beaux and belles may\r\nhave the most magnificent ball ever known since our Government was\r\nfounded.\r\n\r\nFirst and last, directly and indirectly, it is quite within the range\r\nof the probable that the public and private expenditure of money in\r\nconnection with Mr. Roosevelt’s inauguration will approach, if not\r\nexceed, a million dollars.\r\n\r\nIs it in good taste for the representative of a democratic republic to\r\ngive his sanction to such prodigalities as these?\r\n\r\nMr. Roosevelt is bound to know that there are ten millions of his\r\nfellow-citizens, fashioned by the same God out of the same sort of\r\nclay, who are today in want—lacking the necessaries of life.\r\n\r\nHe is bound to know that in this land, which they tell us is so\r\nprosperous, there are now four million paupers.\r\n\r\nHe is bound to know that there are at least one million half-starved\r\nchildren working in our factories, wearing out their little lives at\r\nthe wheels of labor, in order that the favorites of class legislation\r\nmay pile up the wealth which enables them to dine sumptuously off\r\nvessels of silver and gold.\r\n\r\nHe is bound to know that in one city of his native State of New York\r\nthere are at least half a million of his brother mortals who never have\r\nenough to eat, and that seventy thousand children trudge to the public\r\nschools, hungry as they go.\r\n\r\nHe is bound to know that all over the Southern States hangs a shadow\r\nand a fear, because an industrious people, whose toil brought forth\r\na bountiful harvest, are being driven by a remorseless speculative\r\ncombine into misery and desperation.\r\n\r\nIt would have been a proof of excellent judgment if the robust manhood\r\nof Theodore Roosevelt had asserted itself against the snobbery of our\r\nshoddy “Society” in Washington, by reducing the ceremonial of his\r\ninauguration to the modest measure of what was decorous and necessary.\r\n\r\nIt is no time for ostentatious display of military power or of\r\nill-gotten wealth. It is no time to be acting the ape of a German\r\nKaiser or an English King. It is no time to allow free rein to a rotten\r\nNobility of Money-bags, which seeks to turn the simple swearing-in of\r\nthe Chief Servant of a free people—freely chosen by ballot—into a\r\nquasi-royal coronation of an hereditary beneficiary of the monstrous\r\ndogma of Divine Right.\r\n\r\n_One_ of Mr. Roosevelt’s predecessors had long been familiar with\r\ncourts and princes and kings, and they had filled him with so deep a\r\ncontempt for idle, vain and pompous display that when he came to be\r\ninaugurated President of the United States he simply gathered around\r\nhim a few of those who were at his hotel, walked with them up Capitol\r\nHill, took the oath of office before his assembled fellow-citizens and\r\ndelivered to them his inaugural address—which still ranks as a classic\r\nin the political literature of the world.\r\n\r\nThis President was he who broke the power of the Barbary Pirates to\r\nwhom Washington had paid tribute. He it was who by the daring seizure\r\nof opportunity gained Louisiana and raised this Republic from its place\r\nas a power of the third class into the dignity of a nation of the first\r\nclass, by a sweep of his pen, lifting our Western boundary from the\r\nMississippi and setting it on the coast line of the Pacific.\r\n\r\nHis inauguration was simplicity itself, but his administration was full\r\nof the grandeur of great deeds accomplished.\r\n\r\n_This was Thomas Jefferson._\r\n\r\n_Another_ of Mr. Roosevelt’s predecessors had been _a hero in three\r\nwars_. In the Revolutionary War he had fought bravely, though only a\r\nboy. In the Indian wars he had led armies from the upper Chattahoochee\r\nto the Gulf of Mexico, adding an empire to our domain. In the War of\r\n1812 he had taken the volunteers of the South, and at New Orleans had\r\nwhipped the veterans of Wellington as English soldiers had never been\r\nwhipped before and have never been whipped since.\r\n\r\nEntering civil life, this great soldier dashed himself against the\r\npower of Clay, Webster and Calhoun, triumphing over them all.\r\n\r\nYet when he came to be inaugurated President of the Republic whose\r\nglory and power he had so greatly increased, it contented him to go\r\nquietly from the old Metropolitan Hotel, accompanied by the Marshal of\r\nthe District and a volunteer escort, to take the oath of office in the\r\nSenate Chamber, without the slightest attempt at pompous ceremonial.\r\n\r\nThe great soldier was honored by a salute fired by the local military,\r\nand, with that salute, the function ended.\r\n\r\n_This was Andrew Jackson._\r\n\r\nI do not say that times have not changed and that customs have not\r\naltered, but I do say that the sober judgment of the judicious,\r\nthroughout the country, would have profoundly approved the course of\r\nMr. Roosevelt had he put the curb upon the snobs and the flunkies and\r\nthe imitation courtiers, who are about to distinguish his inauguration\r\nby an excess of military display, ornamental frippery, tommy-rot\r\nformalities and prodigal expenditure of money such as has not been\r\nknown since Edward the Seventh was crowned King of England.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _Elucidations_\r\n\r\n    FADS—Other people’s hobbies.\r\n    ALLOWANCE—A sum of money we spend before we get it.\r\n    PESSIMIST—A person who is perfectly happy only when\r\n              he is perfectly miserable.\r\n    HUSH MONEY—The kind that talks most.\r\n    A DISTANT RELATIVE—A rich one.\r\n    BARGAIN COUNTER—A place where women buy things they don’t\r\n                    want with money they do want.\r\n    WEATHER REPORT—One that is not always verified.\r\n    HONEYMOON—The brief period before the novelty wears off.\r\n    NOTORIETY—Something that doesn’t last so long as fame,\r\n              but brings in more money.\r\n    THE SIMPLE LIFE—The existence led by people who invest\r\n                    in get-rich-quick schemes.\r\n\r\n                                              J.

The solitary\r\npassenger was Henry Roberts, an American, who found himself at last\r\nnear the end of a long and tedious journey—half by railroad and half\r\nby steamer—along the South American coast.\r\n\r\n“Four days,” he muttered to himself, “and not a soul to speak to but\r\nthis one stray fellow-countryman! Between Spanish and French and Dutch\r\nmy head is in a whirl. Gee whiz! What a night!”\r\n\r\nThe exclamation was prompted by an unusually violent gust of wind,\r\nwhich flung itself around the edge of the cabin and compelled the\r\npassenger to make a precipitate retreat into the hot and ill-lighted\r\ninterior. However, it was not very long before his impatience was\r\nrelieved. The vessel was slowing up still more, and he hurried up on\r\ndeck again, where, from the shouts of the crew, he made out that the\r\ndock was near.\r\n\r\n“I wish you luck!” said the officer, as they parted. “I have looked\r\nup a time-table, and there is a train due to leave in about an hour;\r\nit probably won’t start for three or four more, after the fashion of\r\nthe country, so you will have plenty of time. You ought to reach your\r\ndestination before morning, however.”\r\n\r\nAnd soon afterward Henry Roberts with a satchel in either hand, made\r\nhis way across the rickety gangplank and set out as fast as he dared\r\ndown the unlighted dock. He was gruffly held up by someone who greeted\r\nhim in French, and left him uncertain for a few minutes as to whether\r\nor not he was a highwayman. It proved, however, to be merely a\r\ncustom-house officer, and after the usual ceremony of tipping had been\r\ngone through with, the passenger once more set out.\r\n\r\nHe was half expecting to be greeted by a row of cabmen, but if any such\r\nexisted in St. Pierre they had been frightened away by the storm, and\r\nhe was compelled to find his way to the station by himself. He found\r\nonly a dimly lighted shed, with apparently no person in sight. To his\r\ngreat relief, however, the train arrived only a short time afterward,\r\nand he made his way into the stuffy car, which was lighted only by an\r\nill-smelling oil lamp at one end.\r\n\r\nThere was another long wait before the train finally started, having on\r\nboard only one other passenger besides Roberts.\r\n\r\nThis person was, apparently, either an Englishman or an American—a\r\ntall, slenderly built man with an exceedingly pale face. As he came\r\ninto the car very silently and seated himself at the extreme end,\r\nturning away as if to escape observation, Roberts refrained from\r\nattempting to open a conversation with him.\r\n\r\nThough he did not understand a word of French, he had the name of his\r\nstation firmly settled in his mind and lost no time in impressing it\r\nupon the conductor of the train. When he had made certain that the\r\nlatter perfectly understood his meaning he sank back in the seat and\r\nclosed his eyes with a peaceful feeling that at last his troubles\r\nwere over. The road was, however, a remarkably ill-built one and the\r\ncar swayed in such a manner that he found it impossible to secure a\r\nmoment’s rest. He fell at last to watching the other passenger.\r\n\r\nThis person had at first remained with his head sunk forward as if in\r\nthought; but the ride had continued only about half an hour before\r\nRoberts saw that his fellow-traveler was looking up and gazing about\r\nnervously. Several times he leaned forward suddenly, as if to spring to\r\nhis feet, but each time he again sank back, and once the American heard\r\nhim mutter a subdued exclamation to himself.\r\n\r\nHe seemed to be growing more and more excited. And then suddenly came\r\nthe climax of the whole unusual performance. The man bounded to a\r\nstanding position, an expression of the wildest terror on his face. “I\r\ncan’t do it!” he gasped, in a choking voice. An instant later he leaped\r\nforward.\r\n\r\nThere was a window in front of him, and for an instant Roberts thought\r\nthat he meant to fling himself from it. But, instead, the man reached\r\nfor the bell-rope and gave it a fierce jerk.\r\n\r\nThe effect was immediate, the train at once beginning to slow up. The\r\nstrange man turned and rushed down the car, his eyes gleaming and his\r\narms waving wildly. “I can’t do it!” he cried again and again. “I can’t\r\ndo it!”\r\n\r\nIn a second or two more he had passed Roberts and bounded out of the\r\nrear door, where he disappeared in the darkness.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the conductor, who had apparently been on the engine,\r\ncame rushing back to ascertain what was the matter. As the two hurried\r\nback to the rear platform Roberts managed to make the man understand\r\nwhat had occurred.\r\n\r\n“The fellow must have been crazy,” Roberts thought to himself, as he\r\ngazed out into the blackness of the night. “At any rate,” he added, “it\r\nis not likely that we will see anything more of him.”\r\n\r\nThe conductor was evidently of the same opinion, for after several\r\nminutes of waiting and after a consultation with the engineer, the\r\ntrain was again started and the journey continued.\r\n\r\nThe conductor signified to Roberts that the next stop was his\r\ndestination, and a quarter of an hour later he found himself in the\r\nmidst of absolute blackness. The train had started on at once, and the\r\npassenger stood for several minutes uncertain which way to turn, for\r\nthere was not a house, nor even so much as a platform beneath his feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II\r\n\r\nAt last, however, as his eyes grew used to the darkness, he managed to\r\nmake out what appeared to be some kind of structure nearby, and toward\r\nit he stumbled. It was a small shed, in the shelter of which he stopped.\r\n\r\n“Good heavens!” he muttered to himself. “What kind of a town can this\r\nbe?”\r\n\r\nHis cousin had unfortunately not known when he was to arrive, and the\r\nmines, as he knew, were a number of miles away, so he had nothing to\r\nhope for from that quarter.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps there is only this shed and the road!” he groaned to himself.\r\n“Not even a hotel!”\r\n\r\nThere was no sign of one, at any rate, and the storm did not encourage\r\nefforts at exploration. “Perhaps if I give a few yells it will bring\r\nsomebody,” thought Roberts.\r\n\r\nHe reflected that it was as likely to bring a wildcat as anything else,\r\nbut he determined to risk the effort. He had scarcely opened his mouth,\r\nhowever, before his shout was answered; and at the same moment his ear\r\nwas caught by the sound of a vehicle behind him.\r\n\r\nHe waited anxiously. He heard the carriage come to a stop and then a\r\ncouple of men walking about. They came toward the shed, and he found\r\nhimself confronted by two dark forms, heavily wrapped as a protection\r\nagainst the storm.\r\n\r\n“_Bien venu, monsieur_,” remarked one of the strangers. He extended\r\nhis hand, and Roberts, supposing that that might be the custom of the\r\ncountry, put out his own and exchanged greetings.\r\n\r\n“_Monsieur est arrivé?_” continued the other. “_Un très longue voyage!_”\r\n\r\nRoberts’s reply to that was only a melancholy shake of his head. “What\r\nin the world did I study German for?” he groaned to himself.\r\n\r\n“_Vous ne comprenez pas?_” continued the mysterious Frenchman.\r\n\r\nA vigorous shake of the head was the American’s only reply. “Don’t you\r\nspeak English?”\r\n\r\nThe only result was likewise a negative shaking of the head, and the\r\nAmerican gave a groan.\r\n\r\n“I want a hotel!” he exclaimed. “Can you tell me where to go? What in\r\nthe world am I going to do?”\r\n\r\nThere was a minute or two more of rather embarrassing silence. Then the\r\nspokesman of the two strangers gave a hearty laugh.\r\n\r\n“_Allons!_” he said. “_Cela ne fait rien._”\r\n\r\nAnd, to Roberts’s surprise, he stooped down and picked up one of his\r\ntraveling-bags.\r\n\r\n“_Allons!_” he cried again. “_Allons!_”\r\n\r\nThe man took the traveler by the arm and escorted him to the carriage,\r\nwhich had remained standing in the darkness. In a few seconds more the\r\nAmerican and his baggage were inside and being rapidly driven off down\r\nthe muddy road.\r\n\r\n“Well, this is an adventure!” thought Roberts to himself. “Either I\r\nhave come across some charitable stranger or else the hotel here runs a\r\nstage—I don’t know which to think!”\r\n\r\nDuring the ride the two men made no further attempt to communicate with\r\nhim. Roberts heard them speak to each other once or twice in a low\r\nvoice, but for the most of the time the drive was made in silence.\r\n\r\n“At any rate,” he thought, with a chuckle, “it can’t do me any harm,\r\nand I shall get out of the rain.”\r\n\r\nBefore the trip was over, however, Roberts found himself beginning\r\nto feel somewhat uncomfortable because of the length of it. “Good\r\nheavens!” he muttered, “it can’t be a hotel this distance away, and for\r\nall I know, I may be going in exactly the opposite direction from the\r\nmines!”\r\n\r\nHe had already been sitting in the bumping vehicle for an hour when\r\nhe made that reflection; however, he was given fully another hour to\r\nruminate over it before the drive came to an end. Several times he made\r\nan attempt to inquire from the strangers where or how much farther\r\nhe was going, but his efforts met with no success, and a “_Soyez\r\ntranquille_,” was all he could get, accompanied by a gentle motion of\r\npushing him back into the seat.\r\n\r\nHe had about made up his mind to trouble himself no further when the\r\ncarriage suddenly made a sharp turn and came to a stop; one of the men\r\nopened the door and stepped out.\r\n\r\nThere was a few seconds’ wait, during which several voices were heard\r\ncalling outside; and then suddenly Roberts, who was gazing out of the\r\nwindow with not a little anxiety, caught sight of a light, apparently\r\nin the window of a house. Only a short distance from the carriage a\r\nflood of light suddenly streamed before his eyes, coming from an open\r\ndoorway.\r\n\r\nHe saw several figures moving about, and at the same time the other man\r\nin the carriage sprang quickly out.\r\n\r\n“_Nous sommes arrivés!_” he exclaimed. “_Voici!_”\r\n\r\nAnd Roberts lost no time in taking his other satchel and springing out\r\nof the carriage. As he did so he found himself covered by an umbrella\r\nheld by a shadowy form near him, and under the protection of this he\r\nhurried up the path and the steps to the house.\r\n\r\nBy this time more lights had appeared in the windows, and by the single\r\nglance which he had Roberts saw that he was in front of a very large\r\nbuilding, consisting of at least two stories, and with extremely broad\r\nand, at present, brilliantly lighted windows. It was only a few seconds\r\nlater before he found himself in the entrance, which he discovered to\r\nbe apparently that of an elegant mansion.\r\n\r\n“Good gracious!” he thought, “I wasn’t prepared for a house like this!”\r\n\r\nBut there were still greater surprises in store for him. He found that\r\non either side of the doorway two domestics were standing, bowing\r\nobsequiously at his entrance. The person who had obligingly covered him\r\nwith the umbrella proved to be an attendant, similarly attired, and as\r\nRoberts entered the house one stepped forward for his satchel, and the\r\nother took his rain-soaked hat as he removed it; a second later the\r\nastonished man found himself being graciously relieved of his dripping\r\novercoat by yet another obliging personage.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime he was gazing about him; what he saw fairly took his\r\nbreath away. He was no more prepared for such things than if he had\r\nbeen traveling in the wilds of Africa. He found himself in the midst\r\nof a broad, well-lighted hallway, on either side of which opened\r\nsplendid parlors containing every conceivable kind of luxurious\r\nappointment—splendid furniture and tapestry, mirrors and pictures.\r\nIn the hall he saw a broad, open fireplace, in which a great log was\r\nblazing, casting a glow in every direction.\r\n\r\nWhile Roberts was staring at it, and feeling his heart expand with\r\nsatisfaction, one of his traveling companions carrying the other\r\nsatchel, had come hurrying into the room. He took off his hat and\r\nflung back his heavy coat, disclosing to the American’s view a rather\r\nstout and short elderly personage, with a gray beard and an extremely\r\npleasant countenance.\r\n\r\n“He looks promising, at any rate,” thought Roberts, “even if I can’t\r\nunderstand what he says!”\r\n\r\nThe man, after handing his coat to one of the domestics, bowed\r\ngraciously to Roberts with another “_Bien venu, monsieur!_” Then he\r\nsignaled the American to make himself comfortable before the fire, and\r\nRoberts lost no time in following his host’s suggestion, as he had been\r\nwet and cold for many hours.\r\n\r\n“If this is an inn,” the stranger thought in the meantime—“gee whiz!\r\nbut what will the bill be!”\r\n\r\nAll his belongings had by this time been carried away by the servants\r\nand he was left alone with his obliging host. The latter, after rubbing\r\nhis hands a few times before the fire and surveying his guest with\r\nconsiderable interest, suddenly demanded:\r\n\r\n“_Avez-vous faim, monsieur?_”\r\n\r\nThe American, of course, did not understand that, but he comprehended\r\nthe signal a second later, and nodded his head vigorously. The other\r\ncalled for one of the servants and gave him a command.\r\n\r\nThe latter signed to Roberts to precede him up the broad staircase\r\nwhich opened into the hallway, and he soon found himself in front of an\r\nopen door which led into a beautifully furnished bedroom. He entered,\r\nand the man followed, closing the door behind him.\r\n\r\nRoberts gazed about him with something of a gasp of consternation. Here\r\nalso was a grate fire, before which his hat and coat had been hung.\r\nThe rest of his baggage had been brought into the room, and lying upon\r\nthe bed he found a complete change of clothing, lacking nothing, from\r\nnecktie down to evening slippers.\r\n\r\nAlmost before he had half succeeded in comprehending the state of\r\naffairs the servant, after several profuse bows, had set to work calmly\r\nremoving his clothing.\r\n\r\nRoberts was not used to a valet, but he concluded to keep the secret as\r\nwell as possible and meekly allowed himself to be dressed. Half an hour\r\nlater he was completely equipped, and the servant darted briskly to the\r\ndoor and opened it with an overwhelming bow.\r\n\r\n“If this is a hotel, it beats anything New York can show,” was the\r\ntraveler’s decision by this time. “And if it is not a hotel, it can\r\nonly be a fairy-story!”\r\n\r\nHowever, without troubling his head any further, he followed the\r\nservant down the stairs, at the end of which he found his genial host\r\nawaiting his arrival. The latter immediately took his arm and escorted\r\nhim through one of the parlors, at the other end of which a door was\r\nflung open by the servant.\r\n\r\nA little dining-room was disclosed to his view—a dining-room so\r\nperfect in all its furnishings that it cost him an effort to restrain\r\nan exclamation. The table was a small one, but was perfectly appointed,\r\nwith cut-glass and silver, and there were several small lamps upon it.\r\n\r\nThere were seats for only two, and after the Frenchman had seated his\r\nguest he himself took the other chair. Then a dinner was served which\r\nwas the first respectable meal the American had eaten since he left\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nHe had by this time determined to enjoy himself and let his cousin pay\r\nthe bill, if necessary; so he made no attempt to restrain his appetite.\r\nHis host evidently expected him to be hungry after his journey, for he\r\nplied him with every conceivable variety of eatables.\r\n\r\n“Where in the world can they get them all from?” Roberts thought. “I\r\nhave been expecting to live on beans and bacon up at the mines!”\r\n\r\nTo be sure it was rather an embarrassing meal, from one point of view,\r\nfor the utmost in the way of conversation which could be managed was an\r\noccasional exchange of smiles between the two persons. “But if we could\r\ntalk there might be an end to this state of affairs!” thought Roberts.\r\n“And I have no mind to be turned out until daylight, anyway.”\r\n\r\nBy this time his cogitations over the strange condition of things\r\nhad resulted in the conclusion that it could not possibly be an inn\r\nto which he had come. “It must be some kind of a private house,” he\r\nthought. “But what in the world is it doing away off up here in this\r\nlonely, God-forsaken country, and what the people want to do with me is\r\nmore than I can imagine. I can’t help thinking it is a mistake of some\r\nkind; and I wonder who can live here—surely, not this queer little\r\nfellow, all by himself!”\r\n\r\nRoberts had seen no one else except the servants, but this did not seem\r\nstrange when he came to think of it, for on the mantelpiece was a clock\r\nwhich informed him that it was then nearly two in the morning.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps I will find out more when day comes,” he thought. “I am safe\r\nfor tonight, anyhow, I think.”\r\n\r\nAnd so it proved, for when at last the meal was over, the Frenchman\r\nrose and politely bowed his new acquaintance to the door. There he\r\nsummoned one of the servants, again bowed to Roberts with a “_Bonne\r\nnuit, monsieur!_” and, after shaking hands, Roberts turned to follow\r\nthe servant up the stairway.\r\n\r\nThe two made their way into the bedroom which the American had visited\r\nbefore, and where he found that his baggage had been all unpacked\r\nand neatly stowed away in a bureau in the room. The servant bowed\r\nhis departure at the door, which was closed behind him, and then the\r\nastounded stranger sat down on the bed and, as the ludicrousness of the\r\nsituation and the whole proceedings flashed over him, he flung himself\r\nback and gave vent to a silent fit of laughter.\r\n\r\n“This will certainly be a story to tell if I ever get home again!” he\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nBut he was too sleepy by this time to trouble himself any further, and\r\nhe rose and prepared to make the most of the opportunity afforded him\r\nfor slumber. “I guess I will just take off my coat,” he thought, “for I\r\ndon’t know when the mistake may be discovered.”\r\n\r\nAs he performed that operation his hand happened to strike upon his\r\nback-pocket, where he had safely stowed away a small revolver. “If there\r\n_should_ turn out to be anything wrong!” he thought, with a laugh.\r\n\r\nAll during that evening the man had been racking his brains trying to\r\nthink of some possible explanation of his strange reception. During\r\nthe drive he had been somewhat alarmed, but his welcome had served to\r\nremove any suspicion of possible danger. But just then, as he gazed\r\nabout the room, he suddenly observed something which gave a most\r\nunexpected turn to his thoughts.\r\n\r\nThe room to which he had been ushered was a large bedroom, perfectly\r\nfurnished in every way, and having two broad windows; it was the latter\r\nwhich suddenly caught Roberts’s eye, and as they did so he experienced a\r\nstart of emotion that was very different from his former state.\r\n\r\nHe had noticed the startling fact that both of the two windows were\r\nprotected by heavy iron bars!\r\n\r\nFor a minute or two Roberts stood gazing at them, scarcely able to\r\nrealize the full significance of the discovery. He darted a swift\r\nglance about the room to make sure that he was alone, and then he\r\nsprang quickly forward to test them. He found that they were firmly set\r\nin the heavy masonry of the window-sill, and that they were scarcely\r\nwide enough apart to permit his arms to pass through.\r\n\r\nThen the very decidedly sobered American sank back in a chair and again\r\ngazed about him.\r\n\r\n“I can scarcely think it means any danger,” he muttered to himself,\r\n“for I am unable to think what kind of danger it could be—but yet, it\r\nis most extraordinary!”\r\n\r\nSuddenly another idea came to his mind and brought him to his feet\r\nwith a jump. He sprang toward the door, and as he approached it half\r\ninstinctively he began stepping more quietly until as he neared it he\r\nwas advancing on tiptoe.\r\n\r\n“One of those fellows in livery may be outside,” he thought.\r\n\r\nThen he took hold of the knob and very softly and silently turned it.\r\nWhen it was turned all the way he gave a slight push at the door, which\r\nopened outward.\r\n\r\nAnd as he did so he felt the blood rush to his forehead and his breath\r\nalmost stopped. He flung his weight against the door violently, but it\r\ndid not move. Almost overcome with his discovery, he staggered back\r\nagainst the wall.\r\n\r\n“By Jove!” he panted, “I am locked in!”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n\r\nRoberts began pacing very anxiously up and down the floor of the room.\r\nHe did not continue that for very many minutes, however, before he\r\nstopped abruptly and again seated himself in the chair.\r\n\r\n“There is something wrong here,” he muttered, “mighty wrong! But I\r\ndon’t want them to know I have discovered it.”\r\n\r\nHe sat for several minutes with his head in his hands, gazing straight\r\nin front of him, his mind in a perfect tumult. He was absolutely\r\nwithout any possible idea as to what that state of affairs could mean\r\nor what object his mysterious host could possibly have in taking him\r\nprisoner.\r\n\r\n“There is one comfort, however,” he muttered. “Heaven is to be thanked\r\nfor that!”\r\n\r\nHe took the revolver from his pocket as he muttered the words; all of\r\nits chambers were loaded, and he put it back into his pocket with a\r\nslight chuckle of satisfaction.\r\n\r\n“I guess they didn’t count on that. They have got me in here, but it’ll\r\nbe another thing to get me out!”\r\n\r\nThere was but very little idea of sleep left in his mind. When at last\r\nhe had decided that there was no solving the mystery with the few facts\r\nthat he knew, he began stealthily moving about the room and examining\r\neverything in it.\r\n\r\nDirectly at the head of the bed he found a handsome portiere hanging,\r\nand as he reached behind this he discovered that there was another door\r\nto the apartment.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps they haven’t locked that,” he thought. “I wonder where it\r\nleads to?”\r\n\r\nHe slipped in behind the curtain and proceeded to test that door also.\r\nHe set about the matter with the utmost caution, for by this time he\r\nwas firmly convinced that it was more than likely that someone was\r\nkeeping watch outside of his room.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner had really very little idea of finding the door unlocked;\r\nhe did not think it likely that his captors would have neglected that\r\nprecaution, and he was thoroughly prepared to spend the rest of the\r\nnight in his prison. Such being the case, his surprise and delight may\r\nbe imagined when, upon turning the knob and pushing softly, he found\r\nthe door giving way before him.\r\n\r\nHis heart was thumping with excitement as he made this discovery, and\r\ninch by inch he opened the barrier wider. He could see nothing, for\r\nthe curtain back of him shut out the light from his own room and the\r\nnext apartment appeared absolutely dark. However, when it was opened\r\nwide enough for him to slip in, Roberts stole cautiously forward, and\r\nwas soon standing on the floor of the other room. All about him was\r\nabsolutely dark and silent, but he groped around him for some distance\r\nbefore he finally concluded to go back and get a little light.\r\n\r\nFrom a notebook in his pocket he tore several pages, which served him\r\nfor a small taper; and by this he made the discovery with consternation\r\nthat the apartment into which he had come was a tiny cell, not more\r\nthan fifteen feet square. There was a square window, high up from the\r\nground and heavily barred. By the faint light which he had Roberts saw\r\nthat the walls of the place were all stone, and that the door through\r\nwhich he had come was composed of iron!\r\n\r\n“Great heavens!” he gasped. “I am in a fearful trap, as sure as I’m\r\nalive!”\r\n\r\nHe gripped his revolver in his hand, turned, and once more crept back\r\ninto his own room to wait. However, he found that everything there was\r\nas silent as before, and after some little meditation over the problem\r\nhe removed several more pages from his notebook and set out for another\r\nexploration.\r\n\r\nHe had noticed on the other side of that tiny cell another door,\r\nexactly like the first. “I wonder where that leads?” he thought; and\r\nthis time he twisted his tiny taper so as to make it last longer, and\r\nthen again crept forward.\r\n\r\nHe darted across the stone floor and paused before the other iron door.\r\nThere was a keyhole there through which he could see a light shining,\r\nbut he could make out nothing by peering through. After pausing and\r\nlistening for several seconds and hearing absolutely no sound of any\r\nkind, he determined upon a bold expedient.\r\n\r\n“I am here,” he thought, “probably for good. I am likely to have a\r\nfight whenever I try to get out, so it might as well be now as any\r\ntime, for it will be an advantage to take the other people unawares.”\r\n\r\nAnd his mind once made up on that point Roberts softly turned the knob\r\nof the door. As he did so he pushed against it; but it did not yield.\r\n\r\nThere was another effect, however, one which caused him to give a start\r\nof alarm. The sound he had made had evidently been heard, for on the\r\nother side he heard a soft exclamation and then a footstep in the room.\r\n\r\n“That settles it!” Roberts murmured. “They have heard me!”\r\n\r\nHe pushed at the door still harder and then gave a savage lunge; but\r\nthe barrier remained firm, and he knew that it was locked.\r\n\r\nAt the same instant the sound of moving became much more distinct, and\r\nRoberts, without a second’s hesitation, turned and sprang back toward\r\nhis own room. “It is better to be caught there than here,” he thought\r\nin a flash.\r\n\r\nBut before he had taken half a dozen steps he was stopped by a new and\r\nunexpected development. He heard a voice behind him, coming through the\r\ncrack in the door he had been trying.\r\n\r\n“Who’s there?” it cried. “Who’s there?”\r\n\r\nAnd the words were in English!\r\n\r\nThe voice was a low whisper. In an instant it occurred to Roberts that\r\nthis might be a friend, a prisoner like himself! He turned and crept\r\nback toward the door.\r\n\r\n“Who are you?” he cried.\r\n\r\nHis heart was beating so wildly with the excitement that he could\r\nscarcely hear the reply of the other person, who still whispered in a\r\nvery low tone.\r\n\r\n“An American,” was the reply. “Are you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Roberts, “I am.”\r\n\r\n“And have they got you, too?” panted the other breathlessly.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” answered Roberts, “they have got me. What in the world does it\r\nmean?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” said the other, “I haven’t an idea!”\r\n\r\n“Do you mean that you are kept prisoner here without knowing why?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, without the faintest idea; absolutely!” came the breathless\r\nwhisper from the keyhole. “Don’t talk too loud, or they will hear you,\r\nand then heaven knows what fearful things may happen to you! How long\r\nhave you been here?”\r\n\r\n“I only came tonight,” Roberts whispered. “And you?”\r\n\r\nAs he heard the reply it was all he could do to keep his balance; he\r\nclutched at the rough stone wall to sustain himself. The man’s voice\r\nwas reduced almost to a moan as he answered:\r\n\r\n“I have been here twenty years!”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  IV\r\n\r\nEvery drop of blood seemed to leave Roberts’s face, and his head fairly\r\nswam.\r\n\r\n“Twenty years!” he gasped to himself. “In heaven’s name, what can it\r\nmean?”\r\n\r\nThose words seemed to him to cap the climax of the night’s experiences,\r\nand he stood as he was for fully a minute without speaking or asking\r\nanother question of the inmate of the other room. When suddenly the\r\nsilence was broken, it was by the other.\r\n\r\n“Are you sure no one has heard you?” panted the man.\r\n\r\nRoberts sprang to his feet and crept swiftly toward his own room. He\r\npeered out around the front of the bed, but a single glance was enough\r\nto show him that the door was still shut, and that there was no longer\r\nany sign of trouble. Then once more he came back and stooped before the\r\nkeyhole.\r\n\r\n“Tell me,” he gasped breathlessly, “tell me your story. How did it\r\nhappen? Where were you?”\r\n\r\n“I lived in Caracas, in Venezuela,” the other responded. “I was in\r\nbusiness there for years. One day I was surprised in my own house by\r\nthree men, who overpowered me and drove me away in a carriage. They\r\ndrugged me in some way or other, for the next time I knew anything I\r\nwas a prisoner in this room.”\r\n\r\n“And you have stayed there ever since?” panted Roberts, almost beside\r\nhimself with horror.\r\n\r\n“For twenty years!” the man responded.\r\n\r\n“And you have made no attempt to get out?”\r\n\r\n“What good would it do?” cried the other. “They have iron bars for all\r\nthe windows and they keep my door locked.”\r\n\r\n“How do they pass you food?” inquired Roberts. “They must open the\r\ndoor.”\r\n\r\n“Why, yes,” the man answered, “they open the door, but what good does\r\nthat do? There are always a half-dozen men standing in the doorway, and\r\nthey would overpower me if I made any resistance.”\r\n\r\nAs Henry Roberts listened to that narrative he could scarcely believe\r\nthe evidences of his own senses. He had long ago given up any attempt\r\nto think what could be the explanation of this extraordinary state of\r\naffairs. He made one more attempt upon the door, but that apparently\r\ncaused the utmost terror to the other man.\r\n\r\n“You can’t do it,” he said. “It is locked, and that Frenchman has the\r\nkey.”\r\n\r\n“What Frenchman?” asked Roberts.\r\n\r\n“The man who is in charge of this place,” said the other. “The one\r\nwhose prisoner I am.”\r\n\r\n“Is he a short, stout man, with gray hair?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” was the reply, “that is he.”\r\n\r\nRoberts shuddered involuntarily.\r\n\r\n“Oh, don’t speak of him!” continued the other breathlessly. “He is a\r\nfiend! A perfect fiend!”\r\n\r\n“What did he do?” panted Roberts.\r\n\r\n“I cannot tell you all,” was the reply. “It would be too horrible. He\r\nis the master of this place and it is he who keeps me prisoner. On no\r\naccount resist him or cry out for help—it is utterly useless.”\r\n\r\nRoberts felt a grim smile cross his face as he heard those words; he\r\nclutched his revolver tightly.\r\n\r\n“I will risk it,” he thought. “They will have to open that door to give\r\nme some food!”\r\n\r\n“They never fail to watch this door,” the voice whispered in response\r\nto an inquiry from Roberts. “They will hear me and come in here, and\r\nthen—then——”\r\n\r\nThere was an instant or two of silence, during which Roberts waited\r\nfor the man to continue. But he did not do so. For suddenly the deep\r\nsilence which reigned through the place was broken by a different\r\nsound, one that made the American’s hair fairly rise. It was as if the\r\nteeth of the other man were chattering audibly.\r\n\r\n“They are coming!” he whispered in a low gasp, as if he were trying\r\nto speak but dared not. And then a second later Roberts’s ears were\r\nsmitten by a loud, piercing scream. He heard the man bound to his feet.\r\n\r\n“No! no!” he shrieked. “Stop! You shall not! It was not my fault!”\r\n\r\nAt the same instant came the sound of several muffled footsteps about\r\nthe room, and, in another voice, several words which Roberts could not\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\nThe agonized screams of the other person grew louder and louder,\r\naccompanied by sounds which told plainly of a struggle. They lasted for\r\nonly a few seconds, however, and then came a crash and all was silent.\r\n\r\nDuring that incident Henry Roberts had remained crouching at the door,\r\ntoo horrified to move, but, as the sounds died away, for the first time\r\nhe thought of his own peril and was on his feet with a single spring.\r\nHe turned and dashed across the floor of the cell. But even as he did\r\nso he realized that the few seconds’ hesitation had cost him everything.\r\n\r\nThe curtain of his bedroom was suddenly pushed aside, and a hand reached\r\nin to grasp the door. Like a flash Roberts swung up his revolver and\r\nleveled it, but before he could pull the trigger the iron barrier shut\r\nto with a clang that seemed to shake every portion of the man’s body.\r\n\r\nHe was a prisoner in the cell!\r\n\r\nThe American leaned back against the wall, where he stood panting for\r\nbreath and clutching his weapon, staring about him wildly and striving\r\nto pierce the darkness. The effort was vain, however, and the absolute\r\nsilence that prevailed afforded him not the slightest clue as to what\r\nwas going on.\r\n\r\nHe realized with a sinking heart what an advantage he had lost by\r\nfailing to take possession of the large room where he had a light. But\r\neven as he was, with his revolver in his hand, he concluded, after a\r\nfew swift thoughts, that his case was not entirely hopeless.\r\n\r\n“They will have to open the door some time,” he gasped, “and they may\r\nnot know that I have got a revolver.”\r\n\r\nThere was, however, the fearful possibility that his mysterious captor\r\nmight see fit to starve him out. The American realized that he would be\r\nabsolutely helpless before that.\r\n\r\n“But there is a window,” he thought; “perhaps I can shout and attract\r\nattention.”\r\n\r\nPrompted by that thought, he felt his way along the wall until he\r\nreached the opening in question. He raised himself up and peered\r\nbetween the bars; but it was only to make one more discovery. The\r\nwindow was closed by an iron shutter or drop, which resisted all his\r\nefforts to move it.\r\n\r\n“And I am in here without a breath of air!” he thought.\r\n\r\nThe whispered words had scarcely passed his lips before the last\r\nclimax of his mysterious experiences arrived. Suddenly a strange smell\r\nattracted his attention, and as he discovered the cause he gave a gasp\r\nof despair.\r\n\r\nThe room was slowly filling with a gas!\r\n\r\nRoberts even then fancied that he could hear the sound of it entering\r\nthrough some pipe which he could not find. Every second that certainty\r\nwas made more and more plain to him, and he darted forward perfectly\r\nbeside himself with desperation. He flung himself savagely against\r\nthe iron door, but it seemed to laugh at his efforts. He seized the\r\nknob and tugged savagely, but with no effect. He stooped down at the\r\nkeyhole, hoping in that way to escape the new and horrible fate, but he\r\nfound that it also had been closed, and as he rushed across the room to\r\nthe other door exactly the same experience was repeated.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime he had, of course, been breathing the poisoned air of\r\nthe tiny cell. The deadly fumes were becoming stronger and stronger,\r\ncausing him to gasp and his head to reel. Twice more he threw all\r\nhis weight against the door in vain, and then, clutching the knob to\r\nsustain himself, he stood for a second or two, swaying this way and\r\nthat, gasping and striving to hold his breath to keep out the choking\r\nvapor.\r\n\r\nThen everything reeled before him, and he found himself clutching\r\nwildly in every direction. The revolver dropped from his helpless\r\ngrasp, and a second later he pitched forward upon the floor of his\r\ncell. At the very same instant one of the doors was flung open and\r\na flood of light poured into the place. It was the last thing he\r\nperceived as consciousness left him.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   V\r\n\r\nHow long a time Roberts remained unconscious after he had been\r\noverpowered in the room of the mysterious house it was impossible for\r\nhim to say. When his senses returned to him he was in a sort of stupor.\r\nAs one half awake he became conscious of being carried about by someone.\r\n\r\nHe was too dazed to think about his situation or to realize what had\r\noccurred to him, nor was he even conscious of the lapse of time; but\r\ngradually his senses came back to him more and more, to a recognition\r\nof his terrible plight in the hands of mysterious enemies in the midst\r\nof that wild country.\r\n\r\nWith what little strength he had he tried to raise himself, and found\r\nthat both his hands and feet were tightly bound; also a bandage was\r\ntied tightly about his eyes, so that he could not see anything. He was\r\ntoo weak to make any outcry, and could only give himself up helplessly\r\nto his captors.\r\n\r\nSeveral times he heard people speaking in his neighborhood, but as the\r\nlanguage was still French he obtained no clue as to what had happened\r\nto him in the meantime.\r\n\r\n“At any rate,” he thought, “it is something to be alive—_that_ is more\r\nthan I expected.”\r\n\r\nIt was not long after this he was picked up again by two men, who\r\napparently carried him down a flight of steps. By this time Roberts had\r\nrecovered his wits and was anxiously trying to discover any signs as to\r\nhis whereabouts.\r\n\r\nHe heard the door open, and then a fresh breeze told him that he was\r\nbeing carried out of the house.\r\n\r\n“I wonder what in the world is going to happen to me now,” he thought\r\nto himself.\r\n\r\nAgain he made an effort to free his hands, but it was of no use with\r\nthe little strength he had. His head was aching, and he was completely\r\nexhausted by the ordeal through which he had passed.\r\n\r\nFrom the footsteps of the men who were carrying him he made out that\r\nthey were passing next down a gravel walk. At the same time, nearby,\r\nhe heard what he took to be the stamping of horses. “Perhaps it is the\r\nsame place where they took me in before,” he thought. However, that did\r\nhim no good, as he had been brought to the house in the darkness of a\r\nstormy night and had seen nothing of the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nHis surmise was correct, however, for the men raised him and placed him\r\nin a carriage. Two of them sprang in and the horses started rapidly\r\ndown the road.\r\n\r\nThen was repeated the same experience as before, the long ride over the\r\nroughest of roads. Roberts was completely helpless, and was flung this\r\nway and that upon the seat. Perhaps the jarring helped to revive his\r\nfaculties, however, for when the trip was over he was fully alert.\r\n\r\nDuring the ride the two men who were in the carriage whispered to each\r\nother occasionally; but the conversation was in French, as before, and\r\nthe American could understand nothing. It was a weary journey, but it\r\ncame to an end at last. The carriage stopped, the two men sprang out,\r\nand then again he felt himself lifted and carried away.\r\n\r\n“I will pretty soon know what is going to happen to me,” he muttered to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nHe was taken only a short distance before he was set down by the two\r\nmen, who stepped aside and held a whispered conversation. Then suddenly\r\nhe heard them walking away again, and a minute or two later he heard\r\nthe carriage start. It sped rapidly away, and in a half-minute more was\r\nout of hearing, the American being left alone in absolute silence and\r\nwithout any further clue as to what was taking place or where he was.\r\n\r\nHe lay there for fully half an hour, waiting impatiently for the next\r\ndevelopment. He grew more and more impatient, and finally summoned all\r\nhis strength in an effort to free his hands. “Perhaps it will do me no\r\ngood,” he thought, “but I would like everlastingly to make a fight for\r\nit.”\r\n\r\nHis astonishment may be imagined when, at the very first effort, the\r\nrope which bound him parted and left his hands free!\r\n\r\nHe was scarcely able to realize it for a moment, and lay with his\r\nhands still behind his back, trying to grasp the fact that he was at\r\nliberty, or partially so, at any rate. His heart gave a great bound of\r\njoy. There was no doubt, however, that his enemies were nearby, and the\r\nthought made him cautious.\r\n\r\nSlowly and silently he raised his hands to his head and grasped the\r\nhandkerchief which still bound his eyes. It was only loosely tied, and\r\na single pull was sufficient to remove it. The eagerness with which he\r\nglanced about him may be imagined. The first sight that met his eyes\r\nwas the stars; then, realizing that in the darkness he was not so\r\nlikely to be observed, he bent swiftly forward to the rope that bound\r\nhis feet.\r\n\r\nThis, too, he found but loosely tied, and it took him but a few seconds\r\nto loosen it, after which he turned his head anxiously and glanced\r\nabout him. He found himself, apparently, in the midst of an open\r\ncountry, in the shadow of a tall tree. What surprised him most of all\r\nwas the fact that he saw nothing to indicate that anyone was near.\r\n\r\n“They do not seem very careful to guard me,” Roberts thought, “after\r\nall the pains they took to capture me.”\r\n\r\nHowever, there was no time to spend in debating that question. His only\r\nthought was to make the most of his opportunity and escape from that\r\nspot as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\nHe raised himself and began silently to make his way along the ground.\r\nHe was still weak, but for all that he managed to make good time. As he\r\ncrept along he found that he was on a road, and his first impulse was\r\nto reach the thicket at one side. Once in the shade of this he rose to\r\nhis feet, considerably emboldened by his success. He still saw no one\r\nand heard no sounds to indicate that his escape had been discovered, so\r\nhe set out somewhat more boldly, creeping through the underbrush.\r\n\r\nHe was almost beside himself with delight at his sudden and unexpected\r\ngood fortune. He knew that every step he took was carrying him more and\r\nmore to safety, for the nature of the country told him that it would be\r\nalmost impossible for his enemies, whoever they might be, to find him\r\nagain. “It was a terrible experience,” he thought to himself. “This end\r\nof it seems almost like an anti-climax.”\r\n\r\nWhen he was far enough away to be sure that there was no danger of his\r\nsteps being heard he broke into a run, nor did he stop until he was\r\ncompletely exhausted.\r\n\r\nBy that time he knew that he had put fully half a mile of the dense\r\njungle between himself and any possible pursuers. He sat down on the\r\nground to recover his breath and think over the strange situation.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps I shall never come to an explanation,” he thought, “or find\r\nout what that strange Frenchman wanted with me.”\r\n\r\nAs he turned the matter over in his mind, however, there was one thing\r\nabout which he made up his mind definitely, and that was that if he\r\never succeeded in reaching his cousin, he would never cease his efforts\r\nto find out all about that mysterious house, and to inform the proper\r\nauthorities about the unfortunate captive who was detained there. “I\r\nguess I will have a hard time finding him, though,” Roberts thought.\r\n“Perhaps I have only exchanged one danger for another, as I have pretty\r\nwell lost myself in this thicket.”\r\n\r\nIt was just then he chanced to notice that a heavy package had been\r\nstuffed into one of the pockets of his coat. He found it was a paper\r\nparcel, which he took out and examined with not a little curiosity. He\r\nfound that his enemies, as if anticipating his escape, had provided him\r\nwith a supply of food!\r\n\r\nAgain he put his hand to his pocket, and, discovering something else,\r\nproceeded to examine it. There were two pieces of paper, and he struck\r\na match to examine them. One, as he found to his utter consternation,\r\nwas a French bank-note of the value of five hundred francs!\r\n\r\nThat discovery almost overwhelmed him. He sat gazing in silent wonder\r\nat the paper until the match went out. Then he struck another and\r\nproceeded to examine the other piece of paper, which he found was a\r\nnote addressed to him in English:\r\n\r\n        SIR—It was all mistake. We thought you\r\n         were somebody other. We are sorry. We inclose money\r\n         to pay you for your time and loss of——\r\n\r\nAs Roberts read the last word he gave a gasp. Then he swung his hand up\r\nto his head and found to his horror that the statement of the letter\r\nwas only too true. The word was _hair_, and every particle of it had\r\nbeen shaved from his head!\r\n\r\nIf anything had been needed to complete Roberts’s amazement at his\r\nstrange adventure, this would have done it. He sat where he was for\r\nfully five minutes, alternately feeling for his missing locks and\r\nexamining the bank-note and the lunch.\r\n\r\n“All a mistake!” he muttered to himself. “Took me for someone else!”\r\n\r\nThe first thought that came to Roberts after that was a renewal of his\r\nresolution to probe the mystery to the bottom.\r\n\r\n“Mistake or no mistake,” he thought, “those villains intended a\r\nhorrible fate for someone—and they have got that other wretched\r\nprisoner in there yet. I am going to find out what it means or die in\r\nthe attempt!”\r\n\r\nAnd it was with determination in his mind that Henry Roberts at last\r\nraised himself to his feet once more. He tucked the note and bank-bill\r\naway in his pocket and wrapped up the food.\r\n\r\n“At first, I thought it might have been poisoned,” he observed, “but I\r\nguess that is not very likely under the circumstances. It may come in\r\nvery handy, for all I can tell.”\r\n\r\nHe had now made up his mind that there was no longer any chance of his\r\nbeing pursued, and he saw very plainly that his enemies had taken him\r\nto the lonely spot and left him with the intention of allowing him to\r\nfree himself, as he had done.\r\n\r\n“However, they probably took pains to lose me,” he thought, “so that I\r\ncould not come back to revenge myself.”\r\n\r\nAs this thought entered his mind, Roberts instinctively put his hand to\r\nhis back-pocket where his revolver had been. Sure enough, he found that\r\nit had not been returned to him.\r\n\r\n“A wise precaution!” he muttered.\r\n\r\nHis first purpose now was, of course, to get back to the road, so that\r\nhe might find some kind of habitation.\r\n\r\n“I must get to the mines, and get my cousin to help me,” he thought.\r\n\r\nThe task seemed likely to be a difficult one, for in the darkness\r\nRoberts had no way of telling which way he had come. It was by no means\r\na pleasant prospect, that of getting lost in the jungle country.\r\n\r\n“If I had only thought to examine my pockets before I did all that\r\nrunning!” he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nHe could not help laughing at the thought of his wild dash and the\r\nextreme caution and anxiety with which he had freed himself. However,\r\nhis amusement did not last very long; for once more the terrified cries\r\nof the unfortunate prisoner crossed his mind. The last words which he\r\nhad heard from the man were still ringing in his ears.\r\n\r\n“Twenty years!”\r\n\r\nHe started to make his way back through the jungle in the direction\r\nwhere he hoped to find the road he had left. He trudged on for a\r\nconsiderable time, getting more and more involved in the tangled vines\r\nof that swampy region. Finally he concluded that there was nothing else\r\nfor him to do but wait until the dawn. There was no means of telling\r\nwhat wild animals might be near, and he was haunted with the fear of\r\ndisturbing some serpent. At last he determined on climbing one of the\r\nhigh trees. From this vantage point he found that he had not much\r\nlonger to wait. Already the first streaks of dawn were visible in the\r\neast.\r\n\r\nHis tree was one of the tallest in the dense forest, and as soon as\r\nit was light he caught sight of a slight opening in the trees, where\r\nhe discovered the long-sought road, winding up the hillside in front.\r\nWithout a minute’s hesitation he climbed to the ground and set out\r\nthrough the thicket. No shipwrecked mariner was ever more relieved at\r\nthe sight of land. “If I get to the road, I am pretty sure to find\r\nsomeone in the end.”\r\n\r\nTwice he took the precaution to climb a tree to make sure that he was\r\non the right track, and at last he came out upon the thoroughfare. A\r\nsingle glance was sufficient to tell him that a carriage had passed\r\nover it since the recent heavy rain, and he concluded that this was the\r\nroad over which he had been taken.\r\n\r\nHe sat down for a short while to rest and think over the situation. “I\r\nam going to set out and walk until I come to some place,” he decided\r\nfinally. “The only question is in which direction to go.”\r\n\r\nHe had nothing to guide him, and he finally decided haphazard and set\r\nout tramping. He found out that the fresh air and the excitement of\r\nhis escape had served to remove almost all the effects of his recent\r\nunpleasant experience.\r\n\r\n“I have lost nothing,” he thought, “except my hair and my baggage!”\r\n\r\nThe latter had been taken into the mysterious house, and that was the\r\nlast Roberts had seen of it; as he thought the matter over, however,\r\nhe concluded that in all probability the Frenchmen had left it with\r\nhim when they drove away. “And I ran away and left it!” he laughed.\r\n“Anyway, I have got a hundred dollars to pay for it.”\r\n\r\nThe road was so rough as to be almost as difficult as the thicket.\r\nWinding in and out through the dense jungle, sometimes completely\r\ncovered by the interlacing trees and vines, it seemed as if it might\r\nrun on forever.\r\n\r\n“But there must be some house along it!” the man muttered grimly. “If I\r\ncan only find somebody to direct me to the mines!”\r\n\r\nThe sun rose until at last it was beating down fiercely upon the\r\ntraveler. It was long after high noon when at last he made out the\r\nfirst sign that he had gained anything by his mountain journey. There\r\ncame one hill much higher than the rest; as he reached the summit and\r\nglanced around him, he saw a slender column of smoke rising from the\r\nmidst of the dark trees.\r\n\r\n“A house at last!” he cried, and set swiftly forward.\r\n\r\nHe kept his wits about him, however, not forgetting that he was in the\r\nmidst of a strange country. As he descended the hill the smoke passed\r\nout of sight, and he did not again observe it until he was almost upon\r\nthe house from which it proceeded.\r\n\r\nHe took the precaution to turn from the road and make his way through\r\nthe thicket, where the tropical vegetation was so dense about him that\r\nhe could see nothing in front of him even, when various sounds led\r\nhim to believe that he was almost upon the house. And so it was that\r\nsuddenly, without the slightest warning, he came to the end of the\r\nbushes, and the building rose before his very eyes.\r\n\r\nFrom a spot a few yards to one side the road still stretched onward,\r\nbut it had broadened out into a smooth avenue, lined on either side\r\nwith great forest trees. Beneath them was a well-kept lawn, and\r\nperhaps a hundred yards beyond at the end of the avenue was a building,\r\na great mansion, three stories high, and built of handsome stone.\r\n\r\nA single glance at it, and the American staggered back with a gasp. It\r\nwas the house of his recent adventure!\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VI\r\n\r\nRoberts’s first impulse was to spring back into the bushes and crouch\r\ndown to prevent his being observed. There he lay peering out and\r\nwatching the scene.\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt about the house being the same one, for besides the\r\nimprobability of there being two such houses in that dense wilderness,\r\nhe had seen from the lights the general outline of the house on the\r\nnight he had been first taken there. If he had any doubt, a discovery\r\nhe made a short time after was sufficient to remove it.\r\n\r\nTwo sides of the great structure were visible to him from where he was,\r\nand he saw that all the windows were protected with iron bars!\r\n\r\nHe ran his eye over the whole building with considerable curiosity.\r\nExcept for the bars above mentioned, it was a most inviting-looking\r\nstructure, having broad piazzas around it covered with vines and\r\ngrowing plants and a beautiful garden in front. It was situated upon\r\na high elevation, and, even from where he was, Roberts could see\r\nthe broad view stretching beyond on the other side. But the thought\r\nuppermost in his mind while he lay watching the place was less of all\r\nthis than of the wretched American whom he had left there.\r\n\r\nHe had not been there more than five minutes before he saw the door in\r\nfront of the broad avenue open and a man step out. A single glance at\r\nthe figure was enough to tell him that it was the little Frenchman who\r\nhad welcomed him on the night he had been brought there.\r\n\r\n“You scoundrel!” Roberts thought, clenching his hands. “I should like\r\nto get hold of you!”\r\n\r\nThe man had a cigar in his mouth, and began sauntering up and down the\r\npiazza. Roberts had the pleasure of watching him for a considerable\r\ntime at this occupation, and then he came out and fell to examining the\r\nflowers in front of the house.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the American was thinking over his situation and trying\r\nto make up his mind what to do. He was not willing to risk any further\r\nexplorations of the place by himself; and yet, on the other hand, he\r\ndreaded retracing that long walk on the road.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps it goes on,” he thought, “and perhaps I can find another house\r\nbeyond.”\r\n\r\nHe stole back into the bushes and made a circuit of the broad grove to\r\ninvestigate. He found, however, that the road apparently led only to\r\nthe mansion and that he was confronted with the necessity of retracing\r\nhis steps the entire day’s journey.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps they left me near some place,” he thought, “and I would have\r\nbeen all right if I had only waited for daylight!”\r\n\r\nWeakened by his unpleasant experiences, Roberts was not prepared to\r\nundertake that trip immediately. It was then well on toward sunset, but\r\nhe resolved to rest several hours, at any rate.\r\n\r\nHe crept back into the bushes a short distance to make himself safe\r\nfrom discovery and stretched himself out to rest. Several hours passed\r\nin that way, and then, as darkness once more settled upon the place,\r\nhe crept forward for a closer view of the house before leaving it. He\r\nhad not taken very many steps, however, before something occurred which\r\ncaused him to stop abruptly. He could see, through the bushes, the\r\nlights shining out from one or two of the windows. Suddenly, his ears\r\nwere caught by a confused sound of voices. He sprang forward to the\r\nedge of the bushes and gazed out just in time to witness an exciting\r\nscene.\r\n\r\nThe doorway was open and a flood of light was pouring out. In the\r\ndoorway several men were struggling violently.\r\n\r\nAt that very instant one of the voices cried out in English: “Help!\r\nHelp!” And to his consternation Roberts recognized the voice as the\r\nsame he had heard through the keyhole of his cell! It was the American\r\nprisoner!\r\n\r\nAs Roberts realized this, all thought of caution left him. With a yell\r\nhe leaped forward and bounded across the lawn at the top of his speed.\r\n\r\nThe rest happened so quickly that Roberts had no time to think. He saw\r\nthe figures silhouetted in the light of the doorway, one man making a\r\ndesperate struggle against two or three others. Roberts reached the\r\nfoot of the steps leading up to the piazza at the very same instant\r\nthat another figure came dashing around the corner of the porch, crying\r\nout excitedly in French. He recognized both the voice and form as those\r\nof the hated master of the house.\r\n\r\nIt was the opportunity for which he had been wishing. He flung himself\r\nupon the man, and before the latter had time even to throw up his hands\r\ndealt him a blow with all the power of his arm, catching him in the\r\nchest and sending him reeling backward; then, with a shout of\r\nencouragement, he turned and dashed toward the doorway.\r\n\r\nHe was in the very nick of time, for the other prisoner, who had been\r\nmaking a gallant fight for his liberty, was now almost overpowered by\r\nthe men. Roberts recognized them as the same servants who had welcomed\r\nhim upon his entrance. Several others were rushing down the hallway to\r\njoin in the struggle, when he flung himself through the doorway. One of\r\nthe men had pinned the unfortunate prisoner to the wall, but Roberts\r\ndealt him a blow that sent him flying backward. The others turned with\r\na cry of alarm, at the same time loosening their hold upon the prisoner.\r\n\r\nAnd the latter whirled like a flash, and before Roberts had time to\r\nshout to him had dashed out of the doorway and down the steps of the\r\nbuilding. His rescuer paused only long enough to repel a furious\r\nonslaught, and then he, too, turned and rushed away into the darkness.\r\n\r\n“Run! Run!” he yelled to the man he had helped. “Run for your life!”\r\n\r\nThere was no need of the exhortation. The man was fairly flying over\r\nthe ground, making for the thicket beyond.\r\n\r\nRoberts heard footsteps behind him and glanced over his shoulder in\r\ntime to see that his danger was by no means over. It seemed as if\r\nhis shout must have alarmed the whole house. Half a dozen men had\r\npoured out of the doorway and were in full pursuit of the fugitives.\r\nThe nearest of them, who had been rushing up to join in the fight as\r\nRoberts turned, were only a few yards behind.\r\n\r\nRoberts knew that all depended upon his being able to get away into\r\nthe thicket, for he was by no means strong enough for a long race. The\r\nother man seemed able to run faster, and was leaving his rescuer behind.\r\n\r\n“Oh, if I only had my revolver!” he said to himself.\r\n\r\nAs it was, he expected some of the men to fire upon him. Before there\r\nwas time for this, however, the race was over and lost. To the edge\r\nof the bushes was a matter of only a few seconds; the first man\r\ndisappeared and Roberts followed, when suddenly a tangled vine in his\r\npath caught his foot and brought him to earth with a blow so violent\r\nthat it almost stunned him. Not two seconds later Roberts felt a heavy\r\nbody fling itself upon him and heard a voice crying out in the now too\r\nfamiliar French.\r\n\r\nHe tried to struggle to his feet once more to grapple with his\r\nassailant, but his efforts were in vain, for the latter’s cries had\r\nbrought several more to the spot, and before he was able to realize it\r\nRoberts was again a helpless prisoner.\r\n\r\nHis cries were stopped by one of the men flinging his coat about his\r\nhead; then two others picked him up by the arms and feet and set out to\r\ncarry him.\r\n\r\nHe was so breathless and dazed by what had occurred that he was\r\nscarcely able to realize his plight. Once more a prisoner in the hands\r\nof the mysterious Frenchman!\r\n\r\n“Of course, they will take me straight back to the house,” he thought,\r\nand in this he found that he was not mistaken. From the sounds that\r\nreached his ears he knew that a crowd had gathered about those who were\r\ncarrying him, and suddenly, above all the excited cries, Roberts heard\r\na voice that he recognized as that of the master.\r\n\r\n“_Vous l’avez?_” he cried excitedly. “_Bien!_”\r\n\r\nRoberts did not know the meaning of the words, but the Frenchman’s\r\ndelight was sufficiently manifested by the tone of the voice. The\r\nAmerican’s heart sank as he thought of what was before him.\r\n\r\n“He won’t let me off so easily this time!” he thought. “I am not sorry\r\nI whacked him, all the same, and at least that other fellow will\r\nescape!”\r\n\r\nHe was borne swiftly forward by the men; from the sounds of the\r\nfootsteps he knew that they were on the gravel walk once more. Then\r\nthey mounted the steps of the piazza, and through an opening in the\r\ncoat that was still flung over his head he made out the light of the\r\ndoorway. At the same time he heard the voice of the Frenchman and was\r\nborne into the hallway again. The door shut behind him. It sounded like\r\na death-knell in his ears.\r\n\r\n“Probably they will take me back to that very same cell,” he thought.\r\n\r\nAnd then suddenly two of the men seized him by his arms, and the rest\r\nreleased their hold, leaving him standing upon his feet. The coat was\r\nflung from off his face, and he stood before his captors.\r\n\r\nRoberts found himself in the very same hallway as on the previous\r\noccasion, surrounded by the very same servants, and in the presence of\r\nthe very same master. All this was exactly what he had expected, and\r\nnothing of it surprised him. But there was one new circumstance, one\r\nthat left him almost dazed with consternation—the action of the crowd\r\nof men the instant they caught sight of him.\r\n\r\nThe master himself, having apparently recovered from the blow which\r\nRoberts had dealt him, was standing in front of his prisoner; as he got\r\na glimpse of his face he staggered back with an exclamation, and burst\r\ninto a roar of laughter! He began to shake all over with uncontrollable\r\nmerriment, and finally he sank back against the wall, apparently\r\nscarcely able to stand.\r\n\r\nNor were his assistants less strangely affected—they, too, gazed at\r\nthe prisoner, and then went likewise into spasms of laughter. Everyone\r\nin the hall was soon joining in the uproar, and two men who were\r\nholding Roberts were so overcome that they let go their hold of him!\r\nThe puzzled man found himself alone and free once more, but he was so\r\namazed that he could only stand and stare about him.\r\n\r\nIt would not be possible to describe his perplexity. The little\r\nFrenchman, now apparently not in the least alarmed by the fact that\r\nhis prisoner was free, lay back in a chair near the fireplace, almost\r\npurple in the face with laughter. And this situation continued for\r\nfully two minutes more before the man, seeing Roberts’s amazement, rose\r\nto his feet and came toward him.\r\n\r\n“_Monsieur!_” he began, making a desperate effort to control his\r\nlaughter. “_Monsieur! Une très grande bévue!_”\r\n\r\nThen seeing from the expression on Roberts’s face that the remark was\r\nnot understood, he again went into an explosion of merriment.\r\n\r\n“_J’ai oublié!_” he gasped. “_Vous ne comprenez pas_——”\r\n\r\nYet, though Roberts did _not_ understand, there was one thing which\r\nthese things did make plain to him, and which brought him a vast\r\nrelief. This farce, whatever it was, was at least not going to turn out\r\na tragedy for him.\r\n\r\nHe stood as he was in the centre of the hallway watching the crowd.\r\nWhen the first burst of laughter had passed away they remained eagerly\r\ntalking to each other, glancing at him occasionally and gesticulating.\r\nThe little Frenchman, who seemed not to have the slightest enmity\r\ntoward Roberts for having knocked him down, was still standing in front\r\nof him, laughing excitedly and trying to make himself understood. As\r\nhe only continued to shake his head the Frenchman gave a gesture of\r\ndespair. Suddenly, however, a thought seemed to strike him, and he\r\nwhirled about and called to one of the men.\r\n\r\n“_Jacques!_” he exclaimed. “_Appelez Jacques!_”\r\n\r\nImmediately one of the men turned and darted out of the door. It was\r\nonly a few seconds later before another man entered the room and toward\r\nhim the excited little Frenchman rushed. Still shaking with merriment\r\nhe began an excited conversation, glancing occasionally at Roberts. In\r\na few seconds the newcomer was also convulsed with hilarity.\r\n\r\n“_Parlez-lui, Jacques!_” cried the master of the house excitedly.\r\n“_Vite!_”\r\n\r\nAnd the man came toward Roberts, his face strained with suppressed\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\n“Sir!” he stammered, scarcely able to speak. “Sir, I explain!”\r\n\r\n“Go ahead,” said Roberts, who by this time had begun to feel the\r\nlaughter contagious. “Hurry up, for heaven’s sake!”\r\n\r\nThe Frenchman paused for a few seconds, evidently collecting his scanty\r\nknowledge of English; then he turned toward the master of the house.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” he said, making a profound bow, “I introduce—I introduce you\r\nthe Dr. Anselme.”\r\n\r\nThe little Frenchman in turn made a profound bow; at the same time a\r\nsudden idea flashed across Roberts.\r\n\r\nThe two men, who were watching him closely, glanced at each other\r\nand again began laughing uproariously. Then again Jacques began his\r\nlaborious explanation, pausing very long between words.\r\n\r\n“This house,” he said, “this house—it is—it is _une—une_—what is de\r\nword? _Une hôpital_——”\r\n\r\nAgain the man stopped and gazed into the air. In the meantime, however,\r\nRoberts’s brain had been working, and a possible explanation of his\r\nextraordinary adventures with Dr. Anselme had flashed over him.\r\n\r\n“A hospital!” he cried, “an asylum!”\r\n\r\n“_Oui, oui, monsieur!_” cried the man excitedly.\r\n\r\n“There was one man coming,” he continued excitedly, “one——”\r\n\r\n“Patient?” suggested Roberts.\r\n\r\n“_Oui, oui!_” exclaimed the other. “One patient! He was to come——”\r\n\r\nBut the man did not finish his sentence. At that moment there came\r\nthe sound of rolling carriage-wheels, and Dr. Anselme made a sudden\r\nstart for the door and flung it open just as the carriage stopped and\r\na man bounded up the steps of the porch. The little doctor, still\r\nhalf convulsed with laughter, dragged him into the house and began an\r\nexcited conversation with him. In a moment or two the latter turned to\r\nRoberts. He began to speak in fluent English, keeping from giving way\r\nto laughter by a violent effort.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” he said, “my brother wishes me to explain—I have arrived just\r\nin time.”\r\n\r\n“For heaven’s sake!” cried Roberts in relief. “Talk on, and tell me\r\nwhat is the matter!”\r\n\r\n“It is a most extraordinary blunder,” said the newcomer. “You have\r\nescaped a dangerous surgical operation by the merest chance!”\r\n\r\nRoberts placed his hand on his bald head, and everyone in the hallway\r\ngave a roar of laughter.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the other, “that is it. My brother is a well-known\r\nspecialist in mental diseases and has this sanitarium in the mountains.\r\nNo doubt you were surprised to find such a large house so far away from\r\nany city. We were expecting a patient, an American, by the same train\r\non which you arrived. He was suffering from an injury to the skull,\r\nwhich made him liable to periodic attacks of insanity, and he was\r\ncoming up here to be treated.”\r\n\r\n“The very man I saw on the train!” cried Roberts. “A tall, dark-haired\r\nperson?”\r\n\r\n“We do not know in the least what he looks like,” was the reply, “for\r\nhad we known we should not have made the horrible blunder we did.”\r\n\r\nIn a few words Roberts related how the stranger had leaped from the\r\ntrain during the night.\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly,” said the other, “that was he. He probably lacked courage\r\nto come. I have been out hunting for him, but have not found him.”\r\n\r\n“And they were going to operate on me?” Roberts gasped.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the other; “it was only the fact that my brother was unable\r\nto find any trace of injury to your skull that saved you. Then it\r\noccurred to him to search your clothing, and he found your card, which,\r\nof course, showed him the terrible mistake.”\r\n\r\nBy this time Roberts himself was able to join in the uproarious\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\n“But that other man—that prisoner who has been here for twenty\r\nyears—what about him?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“He has been here nearly thirty years,” laughed the other, “but he has\r\nno knowledge of the time. He is a raving maniac!”\r\n\r\n“And I helped him to escape!” gasped Roberts.\r\n\r\n“Yes, you did,” said the other ruefully, “and I am afraid it will take\r\nus many days to catch him!”\r\n\r\n“But why in the world did you take me away and leave me there on the\r\nroad?” cried Roberts, when he was able to speak. “Why did you not\r\nexplain to me?”\r\n\r\n“I would have if I had been here,” the man answered, “but my brother\r\nconcluded that, as you were not destined for here, you were going to\r\nthe mines, which are the only other inhabited spot around here. So they\r\ncarried you to the mines.”\r\n\r\n“To the mines!” gasped the other. “For heaven’s sake, what do you mean?\r\nYou left me out in the middle of the jungle!”\r\n\r\nOnce more the Frenchman went off into a fit of laughter. “Why, they\r\nleft you within fifty yards of the place!” gasped Dr. Anselme’s\r\nbrother. “They did not take you in, as they thought there might be some\r\ntrouble made about the matter and we were anxious to get out of it\r\nwithout any.”\r\n\r\nThen in a few words Roberts told what had happened to him since that\r\nadventure.\r\n\r\n“I thought I was doing something very heroic in rescuing that man,” he\r\nexclaimed. “Please apologize to the doctor for the whack I gave him.”\r\n\r\nDr. Anselme protested that the blow was nothing at all, though Roberts\r\nfancied that he could see him wince at the mere recollection of it.\r\nNothing more was said about that, however, and, still laughing about\r\nthe man’s strange adventures, the doctor turned to the door on one side\r\nand flung it open, disclosing the same familiar dining-room.\r\n\r\n“Sir, I pardon you,” he said, and his brother interpreted, “now sit\r\nagain with us at our table, I beg of you.”\r\n\r\nAnd they went in to supper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _The Day_\r\n\r\n\r\n“Here’s one for you, ’Squire, that I’ll betcha you can’t answer,”\r\ntantalizingly said Hi Spry, as the Old Codger added himself to the\r\nroster of the Linen Pants and Solid Comfort Club. “‘When tomorrow is\r\nyesterday, today will be as far from the end of the week as was today\r\nfrom the beginning of the week when yesterday was tomorrow.

HARBEN\r\n             _Author of “Abner Daniel,” “The Substitute,”\r\n                        “The Georgians,” etc._\r\n\r\n\r\nOld Jim Ewebanks sat down on the wash-bench in front of the widow\r\nThompson’s cabin and watched the old woman as she stood in the doorway,\r\npouring water into her earthen churn to “make the butter come.” He had\r\nwalked over from his cabin across the hollow to bring her a piece of\r\nnews; but the subject was a delicate one, and he hardly knew how to\r\nbroach it.\r\n\r\nIf he had been a lighter man, he would have led her further in her\r\ncheerful comments on the crops, the price of cotton and the health of\r\ntheir neighbors; but deception of no sort was in Ewebanks’s line, and\r\nmoreover, the sun was going down. He could see the blue smoke curling\r\nfrom the mud-and-log chimney on the dark, mist-draped mountainside\r\nacross the marshes and writing a welcome message on the sky. He had a\r\nmental glimpse of his wife as she bent over a big fireplace and put\r\nsteaming food on the supper-table. He was reminded that he had not fed\r\nhis cattle; and still he could not bring himself to the task before him.\r\n\r\nMrs. Thompson’s son, Joe, came up the narrow road from the field,\r\nleading his bay mare. The young man turned the animal into a little\r\nstableyard. With the clanking harness massed on his brawny shoulder he\r\npassed by, nodding to the visitor, and hung his burden on a peg in the\r\nlean-to shed at the end of the cabin.\r\n\r\nThen he went into the entry between the two rooms of the house, and,\r\nrolling up his shirt sleeves, bathed his face and hands in a tin basin.\r\n\r\nEwebanks determined to come to his point before Joe finished washing.\r\nIndeed, a sudden question from the widow made it somewhat easier for\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“What’s fetched you ’long here this time o’ day, Jim?” she asked, as\r\nshe tilted her churn toward the light reflected from the sky and raised\r\nthe dasher cautiously to inspect the yellow lumps of butter clinging to\r\nits dripping surface.\r\n\r\nEwebanks felt his throat tighten. It was hard for him to bring up a\r\nsubject to the mild-faced, reticent woman, which, while it had been\r\ncommon talk in the neighborhood for the past twenty-five years, had\r\nscarcely been mentioned in her presence. He bent down irresolutely and\r\nbegan to pick the cockle-burrs from the frayed legs of his trousers.\r\n\r\nJoe Thompson saved him from an immediate reply by throwing the contents\r\nof his basin at a lot of chickens in the yard and coming toward him,\r\ndrying his face and hands on his red cotton handkerchief.\r\n\r\n“You _are_ off’n yore reg’lar stompin’-ground, hain’t you?” he said\r\ncordially.\r\n\r\nJim Ewebanks made a failure of a smile as his eyes fell on Mrs.\r\nThompson. She had stopped churning, and, leaning on her wooden dasher,\r\nwas studying his face.\r\n\r\n“What fetched you, shore ’nough?” she asked abruptly.\r\n\r\nEwebanks knew that her suspicions were roused. He sat erect and clasped\r\nhis coarse hands between his knees.\r\n\r\n“My cousin Sally Wynn’s been over in the valley today,” he gulped.\r\n“It’s reported thar that yore sister, Mrs. Hansard, is purty low.\r\nWe-uns talked it over—me’n my wife did—an’ Sally, an’ ’lowed you ort\r\nto know. They axed me to come tell you, but as I told them, I hain’t no\r\nhand to—it looks like they could ’a’ picked somebody——”\r\n\r\nHe broke off. There was little change in the grim, lined face under the\r\ngray hair, and the red-checked breakfast shawl which the woman wore\r\nlike a hood. She turned the churn again to the light and peered down\r\ninto the white depths.\r\n\r\nSomeone had once said in the hearing of Ewebanks that nothing could\r\ninduce Martha Thompson to utter a word about her sister, and he\r\nwondered how she would treat the present disclosure. She let the churn\r\nresume its upright position and put the lid back into place; then she\r\nglanced at him.\r\n\r\n“She—hain’t _bad_ off, I reckon,” she said tensely.\r\n\r\n“Purty low,” he replied, his eyes on the ground. “The fact is, Mrs.\r\nThompson, ef you want to see ’er alive you’d better go over thar\r\ntomorrow at the furdest.”\r\n\r\nEwebanks knew he had gone a little too far in his last words, when Joe\r\nbroke in fiercely:\r\n\r\n“She won’t go a step! She sha’n’t set foot inside that cussed house.\r\nThey’ve done ’thout us so fur, an’ they kin longer—dead, dyin’ or\r\nburied!”\r\n\r\n“Hush, Joe!” Mrs. Thompson had left her churn, and with her hands\r\nwrapped in her apron was leaning against the door-jamb.\r\n\r\nJoe didn’t heed her.\r\n\r\n“They’ve always helt the’r heads above us becase we’re poor an’ they’re\r\nrich,” he ran on. “You sha’n’t go a step, mother!”\r\n\r\nMrs. Thompson said nothing. She rolled her churn aside and went into\r\nthe cabin. Ewebanks saw her bending over the pots and kettles in the\r\nred light from the live coals. He saw her rise to arrange the table,\r\nand knew she was going to ask him to supper. He got up to go, said good\r\nday to Joe, who had lapsed into sullen silence, and descended the rocky\r\npath toward his cabin.\r\n\r\nIt was growing dusk; a deepening haze, half of smoke, half of mist,\r\nhung over the wooded hill on the right of the road, and on the left a\r\nnewly cleared field was dotted with the smoldering fires of brush-heaps.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the hill he glanced back and saw Mrs. Thompson in the\r\npath signaling to him. He paused in the corner of a rail fence half\r\novergrown with briars and waited for her. She was panting with exertion\r\nwhen she reached him.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t care to talk up thar ’fore Joe,” she began. “He’s so bitter\r\nagin Melissa an’ ’er folks; but I want to know more. What seems to be\r\nailin’ ’er, Jim?”\r\n\r\n“A general break-down, I reckon,” was the answer. “She’s been gradually\r\non the fail fer some time. I reckon yore duty-bound to see ’er, Mrs.\r\nThompson. I’d not pay any attention to Joe nur nobody else. Maybe\r\nthar’s been some pride on yore side, too.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” she said doubtfully, and then she was silent. She broke\r\na piece of worm-eaten bark from a pine rail on the fence and crumbled\r\nit in her hand.\r\n\r\n“I’ve been wantin’ to tell you some’n fer a long time,” Ewebanks put in\r\ncautiously, “but it wasn’t no business o’ mine, an’ I hate meddlin’. I\r\nhain’t no talebearer, but this hain’t that, I reckon.”\r\n\r\n“I hauled some wood fer ’er one day last spring when me’n my team was\r\ndetained at court over thar. She come out in the yard in front o’ her\r\nfine house whar I was unloadin’. She looked mighty thin an’ peaked an’\r\nlonesome. I had no idea she knowed me from a side o’ sole leather,\r\ngrand woman that she is, but she axed me ef I wasn’t from out this\r\nway. I told ’er I was, an’ then she reached over the wagon-wheel an’\r\nshuck hands powerful friendly like, an’ axed particular about you an’\r\nJoe, an’ how you was a-makin’ of it. I told ’er you was up an’ about,\r\nbut, like the rest of us, as pore as Job’s turkey. She said she’d been\r\na-layin’ off to go to see you, but, somehow, hadn’t been able to git\r\nround to it. She said she’d been porely fer over a year.”\r\n\r\n“She wasn’t porely two year back when I was on my back with typhoid,”\r\nsaid Mrs. Thompson bitterly. “The report went out that I’d never git up\r\nagin, but she never come a-nigh me, nur sent no word.”\r\n\r\n“Maybe she never heard of it,” said Ewebanks. “They had a lot to do\r\nover thar about that time in one way and another. One o’ the gals\r\nwas marryin’ of a banker, an’ t’other the Governor’s son, an’ yore\r\nbrother-in-law, up to his death, was in politics, an’ they was constant\r\na-givin’ parties an’ a-havin’ big company an’ the like. We-uns that\r\ndon’t carry on at sech a rate ortn’t to be judges. I’m of the opinion\r\nthat you ort to go, Mrs. Thompson. Ef she dies you’ll always wish you’d\r\nlaid aside the grudge.”\r\n\r\nThe old woman glanced up at her cabin and awkwardly wiped her mouth\r\nwith her bare hand.\r\n\r\n“It seems sech a short time sence me’n her was childern together,”\r\nshe mused. “We was on the same level then, an’ I never loved anybody\r\nmore’n I did her. She was the purtiest gal in the neighborhood, an’ as\r\nsharp as a briar. Squire Farnhill tuck a likin’ to ’er, an’, as he had\r\nno childern o’ his own, he offered to adopt ’er an’ give ’er a home\r\nan’ education. She was a great stay-at-home an’ we had to actually beg\r\n’er to go. We knowed it was best, fer pa was weighted down with debt\r\nan’ was a big drinker. She was soon weaned from us an’ ’fore she was\r\nseventeen Colonel Frank Hansard married ’er an’ tuck ’er over to his\r\nbig plantation in Fannin’. We had our matters to look after, an’ they\r\nhad the’rn. It begun that way, an’ it’s kept up.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know how true it is,” ventured Ewebanks, “but I have heard\r\nthat her husband was a proud, stuck-up, ambitious man, an’ that he\r\nwished to cut off communication betwixt you two; but he’s dead an’ out\r\no’ the way now.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but sometimes childern take after the’r fathers,” said the widow,\r\n“an’, right or wrong, it’s natural fer a mother to sympathize with her\r\noffspring. I’m sorter afeard the family wouldn’t want me even at ’er\r\ndeathbed. Now, ef they had jest ’a’ sent me word that she was low,\r\nor——”\r\n\r\n“I’d be fer doin’ my duty accordin’ to my own lights,” declared\r\nEwebanks, when he saw she was going no further. “I don’t know as I’d\r\nbe bothered about what them gals, or the’r husbands, thought at sech a\r\nserious time.”\r\n\r\nShe nodded as if she agreed with him, and turned to go. “Joe’s waitin’\r\nfer his supper,” she said. “I’ll study about it, Jim. I couldn’t go\r\ntill tomorrow, anyway. But, Jim Ewebanks—” she hesitated for a moment,\r\nand then she looked at him squarely—“Jim, I want to tell you that I\r\nthink you are a powerful good man. Yo’re a Christian o’ the right sort,\r\nan’ I’m glad you are my neighbor.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II\r\n\r\nThat night Mrs. Thompson had a visit from Mrs. Ewebanks, accompanied\r\nby her daughter Mary Ann, a fair slip of a creature of twelve years.\r\nMary Ann was always her mother’s companion on her social rounds in\r\nthe neighborhood. She was a very timid child and was never known to\r\nopen her mouth on any of these visits. They took the chairs offered\r\nthem before the fire. It was at once evident from Mrs. Ewebanks’s\r\nmanner that she had come to advise her neighbor, and she showed by her\r\ndisregard for oral approaches that she was going to reach her point by\r\na short cut.\r\n\r\n“Jim told me he’d been over,” she began, with a sneer, as she seated\r\nherself squarely in her chair and brushed a brindled cat from under\r\nher blue homespun skirt. “Scat! I don’t want yore flees! An’ he told\r\nme, after I’d pumped ’im about dry, what he was fool enough to advise\r\nyou. Men hain’t a bit o’ gumption. What’s he want to tell you all that\r\nfoolishness fer? I hain’t never had a bit o’ use fer them high-falutin’\r\nHansards. Why, they hain’t had respect enough fer yore feelin’s to even\r\nlet you know yore sister was at death’s door. Sally Wynn jest drapped\r\nonto it by accident.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Thompson was standing in the chimney-corner, her hand on the\r\nlittle mantelpiece, but she sat down.\r\n\r\n“I reckon a body ort not to have ill-will at sech a time,” she\r\nfaltered. “Ef Melissa’s a-dyin’ I reckon it ’ud be nothin’ more’n human\r\nfer me to want to be thar. She mought be sorry you see, in ’er last\r\nhour, an’ wish she’d sent fer me. I’d hate to think _that_, after she\r\nwas laid away fer good an’ all.”\r\n\r\n“Pshaw!” Mrs. Ewebanks drew her damp, steaming shoes back from the\r\nfire. She had something else to say.\r\n\r\n“I never told you, Martha Thompson, but I give it to that woman\r\nstraight from the shoulder not long back. I was visitin’ my brother\r\nover thar. Mrs. Hansard used to drive out fer fresh air when the\r\nweather was good, an’ she stopped at the spring on brother’s place one\r\nday while I was thar gittin’ me a drink—no, I remember now, I was\r\npickin’ a place to set a bucket o’ fresh butter to harden it up fer\r\ncamp-meetin’. She didn’t take no more notice o’ me’n ef I’d been some\r\ncornfield nigger, but you bet I started the conversation. I up an’ axed\r\n’er ef she wasn’t a Hansard an’ when she ’lowed she was, I told ’er I\r\nthought so from her favor to ’er sister over here. She got as red as a\r\npickled beet, an’ stammered an’ looked ashamed, then she sot into axin’\r\nhow you was a-comin’ on, an’ the like.”\r\n\r\n“That was a good deal fer Melissa to do,” observed the widow. “Thar was\r\na time that she never mentioned my name. She’s awful proud.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I’ll be bound you’ll make excuses fer ’er,” snapped Mrs. Ewebanks.\r\n“When folks liter’ly knock the breath out’n you, you jump up an’ rub\r\nthe hurt place an’ ax the’r pardon. As fer me, I give that woman a\r\nsetback that I’ll bet she didn’t git over in a long time. I told ’er as\r\nI looked straight in ’er eyes, that ef she wanted to know how ’er own\r\nsister was makin’ of it, she’d better have ’er nigger drive ’er over to\r\nthe log shack Martha Thompson lives in, an’ pay a call.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you said that!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, an’ she jest set on the carriage-seat an’ squirmed like an eel an’\r\nlooked downcast an’ said nothin’.”\r\n\r\n“That must ’a’ been at the beginnin’ o’ ’er sickness,” said Mrs.\r\nThompson thoughtfully. She had missed the point of her visitor’s story\r\nand kept her eyes on her son, who sat in the chimney-corner, his feet\r\non a pile of logs and kindling pine.\r\n\r\n“The Lord wouldn’t give blessed health to a pusson with her mean\r\nsperit,” resumed the visitor warmly. “I jest set thar an’ wondered how\r\nany mortal woman in a Christian land could calmly ax a stranger about\r\n’er own sister livin’ twenty miles off an’ not go to see ’er. She tried\r\nto talk about some’n else but she’d no sooner git started than I’d\r\ndeliberately switch ’er back to you an’ yore plight an’ I kept that\r\na-goin’ till she riz an’ driv off.”\r\n\r\n“I have heard,” said the widow, her glance going cautiously back\r\nto her son, who had bent down to add another piece of pine to the\r\nfire, “I have heard that Colonel Hansard was always in debt from his\r\nextravagance, an’ that his family lived past the’r means. Brother\r\nThomas went to see Melissa once, an’ he said he believed she was a\r\nmisjudged woman. He ’lowed she was willin’ enough to do right, but that\r\nher husband always made ’er feel dependent on him becase his money had\r\nlifted ’er up. Brother Thomas said the gals had growed up like the’r\r\ndaddy, an’ that between ’em all, Melissa never’d had any will o’ her\r\nown. I reckon I railly ort to go see ’er.”\r\n\r\n“Ef you do they’ll slam the door in yore face,” said Mrs. Ewebanks in\r\nthe angry determination to stir the widow’s pride.\r\n\r\n“I don’t think it’s a matter fer you to decide on, Mrs. Ewebanks.” The\r\nwidow leaned back out of the fire-light, and sat coldly erect. “I\r\nbelieve in doin’ unto others as I’d have them do unto me, an’ ef I was\r\nin Melissa’s fix I’d want to see my only livin’ sister. Facin’ the end\r\nfolks sometimes change powerful. Circumstances made ’er what she is; ef\r\nshe hadn’t been tuck by a rich man, she’d ’a’ been like common folks.\r\nShe used to love me when she was little, an’ I jest don’t want ’em to\r\nlay ’er body away without seein’ ’er once more. I—I used to—I reckon\r\nI still love ’er some.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Thompson’s voice had sunk almost to a whisper. Mrs. Ewebanks moved\r\nuneasily; a sneer had risen on her red face, but it died away. Joe\r\nThompson had suddenly turned upon her from the semi-darkness of his\r\ncorner. There was no mistaking the ferocious glare of his eyes.\r\n\r\n“It—it hain’t none o’ my business,” she stammered; “I—I jest——”\r\n\r\nJoe leaned forward; his round freckled face under the shock of tawny\r\nhair, through which he had been running his fingers, was in the light.\r\n\r\n“Now yo’re a-shoutin’!” he said, with a harsh laugh; “it hain’t none o’\r\nyore business, but you stalked all the way over here tonight to attend\r\nto it.”\r\n\r\n“Hush, Joe, be ashamed o’ yorese’f!” said his mother; “you’ve clean\r\nforgot how to behave ’fore company.”\r\n\r\n“’Fore company hell!” Joe rose quickly and stumbled over a fire-log\r\nwhich rolled down under his feet. There was a hint of tears in his eyes\r\nand he shook his head like an angry dog as he went to the door and\r\nstood with his back to the visitors in sullen silence.\r\n\r\nFor a moment there was silence. Mrs. Ewebanks knew she had blundered\r\nhopelessly. Mary Ann, who never said anything, and who seldom moved\r\nwhen anyone was looking at her, now turned appealingly to her mother,\r\nand, unfolding her gingham sunbonnet, she bent down and swung it like a\r\nswitchman’s flag between her knees. Mrs. Ewebanks paid no heed to it.\r\nShe dreaded her husband’s finding out what had passed, especially as he\r\nhad intrusted her with a message to Mrs. Thompson quite out of key with\r\nher argument.\r\n\r\n“Jim told me to tell you he’d drive you over in his wagon in the\r\nmornin’ ef you are bent on makin’ the trip,” she said almost\r\napologetically.\r\n\r\nJoe Thompson whirled round fiercely. His back was against the door, and\r\nin his checked shirt and rolled-up sleeves he looked like a pugilist\r\nready for fight.\r\n\r\n“We don’t need any help from you-uns,” he snorted. “I’m goin’ to take\r\nmother.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Ewebanks now felt sure that her husband would blame her for the\r\nrejection of his invitation. In her vexation she slapped Mary Ann’s red\r\nhand loose from its urgent clutch on her skirt and turned to Joe.\r\n\r\n“I’m afeard I’ve been meddlin’ with what don’t concern me,” she began,\r\nbut the young man interrupted her.\r\n\r\n“It’s our bed-time,” he said fiercely. “The Lord knows mother’s had\r\nenough o’ yore clatter fur one dose.”\r\n\r\n“Joe!” exclaimed Mrs. Thompson sternly, “I ’lowed you had more manners.”\r\n\r\nMary Ann had drawn her mother’s skirt sharply to one side and grasped\r\nher arm tenaciously. Mrs. Ewebanks allowed herself thus to be unseated,\r\nand she rose meekly enough. There was nothing in her manner resembling\r\na threat that she would never be ordered out of that house again, and\r\nin this Mary Ann witnessed her mother’s first swerving from habit.\r\n\r\nThere was a look on the widow’s face which showed that she was almost\r\nsorry for her visitor’s chagrin.\r\n\r\n“Don’t hurry,” she said in a pained and yet gentle tone.\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, don’t hurry!” Joe repeated, with a sneer; “stay to breakfast;\r\nI’ll throw some more wood on the fire an’ let’s set down an’ talk.”\r\n\r\nThe defeat of Mrs. Ewebanks was more than complete. Between her hostess\r\nand the son she stood wavering. This provoked an actual vocal sound\r\nfrom Mary Ann. At any other time the Thompsons would have marveled over\r\nit. She grunted in impatience and then said audibly:\r\n\r\n“Come on, ma, let’s go home.” And in this it was as if the child had at\r\nonce extended a verbal hand of sympathy to the Thompsons and given her\r\nmother a back-handed slap.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing for Mrs. Ewebanks to do but obey, for Mary Ann\r\nhad stalked heavily from the cabin and just outside the door stood\r\nbeckoning to her. Joe had gone to the fireplace and was digging a grave\r\nin the hot ashes for the fire-coated back-log.\r\n\r\nMrs. Thompson shambled to the door and looked after her departing\r\nguests. She could see their dresses in the light of the thinly veiled\r\nmoon as they slowly descended the narrow path. When the noise Joe was\r\nmaking with the shovel and tongs had ceased she heard someone speaking\r\nin a raised voice. For several minutes it continued, rising and falling\r\nwith the breeze, an uninterrupted monologue, growing fainter and\r\nfainter as the visitors receded.\r\n\r\nIt was the voice of Mary Ann.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n\r\nThe Hansards lived in an old-fashioned, two-storied, white frame\r\nbuilding. It had dormer windows in the gray shingled roof and a long\r\nveranda with massive fluted columns. Back of the house rose a rocky\r\nhill covered with pines, and in front lay a wide, rolling lawn, through\r\nwhich, for a quarter of a mile, stretched a white-graveled drive,\r\nshaded by fine old water oaks from the house to the main traveled road.\r\n\r\nAlong this drive the next morning Joe Thompson drove his mother in a\r\nrickety buggy. On the left near the house was a row of cabins where the\r\nnegro servants lived, and standing somewhat to itself was the white\r\ncottage of the overseer of the plantation. The doors of all the cabins\r\nwere closed, and no one was in sight.\r\n\r\n“I’m afeared she’s wuss, an’ they’ve all gone to the big house,” sighed\r\nMrs. Thompson. “Maybe we won’t git thar in time.”\r\n\r\nJoe made no response, but he whipped his mare into a quicker pace.\r\nWhen they reached the veranda and alighted no one came to meet them. A\r\nnegro woman hastened across the hall, but she did not look toward Mrs.\r\nThompson, who stood on the steps waiting for Joe to hitch his mare to a\r\npost nearby.\r\n\r\n“Ain’t you goin’ to come in?” she asked, when he came toward her.\r\n\r\n“No, I’ll wait out here,” he answered, and he sat down on the steps.\r\n\r\nShe hesitated for an instant, then she turned resolutely into the great\r\ncarpeted hall, and through a door on the right she entered a large\r\nparlor. No one was there. The carpet was rich in color and texture, the\r\nfurniture massive and fine. Over the mantel was a large oil portrait\r\nof Colonel Hansard, and on the opposite wall one of his wife painted\r\njust after her marriage. Set into the wall and hung about with lace\r\ndrapery was a mirror that reached from the floor to the ceiling. From\r\nthis room, through an open door on her left, Mrs. Thompson went into\r\nanother. It was the library. No one was there. On all sides of the room\r\nwere glass-doored cases of richly bound books. Here and there on tables\r\nand stands stood time-yellowed marble busts and pots of plants. In a\r\ncorner of the room was a revolving bookcase, and in the centre a long\r\nwriting-table covered with green cloth.\r\n\r\nThe old woman looked about her perplexed. Everything was so still that\r\nshe could hear the scratching of a honeysuckle vine against the window\r\nunder the touch of the breeze. She wondered if her sister had died, and\r\nif everybody had gone to the funeral.\r\n\r\nShe was on the point of returning to Joe, when she was startled by a\r\nlow moan in an adjoining room. The sound came through a door on her\r\nright, which was slightly ajar. She cautiously pushed it open. The room\r\ncontained an awed and silent group. The crisis had come. Mrs. Hansard\r\nwas dying. She lay on a high-canopied bed in a corner, hidden from Mrs.\r\nThompson’s view by the family and servants gathered at the bed. Seeing a\r\nvacant chair in a row of women against a wall, the visitor went in and\r\nsat down. Her black cotton sunbonnet hid her face, and, as there were\r\nothers present as humbly clad as she, she attracted little notice.\r\n\r\nThere was a breathless silence for a moment. Those at the bed seemed to\r\nbe leaning forward in great agitation. Suddenly one of the daughters of\r\nthe dying woman cried out: “Oh, doctor! Come quick!” and a physician\r\nwho stood near advanced and bent over his patient.\r\n\r\nAfter a moment he silently withdrew to the fireplace, where he simply\r\nstood looking at the fire in the grate. Edith, the eldest child,\r\nfollowed and asked him a question. He gravely nodded, and with her\r\nhandkerchief to her eyes she burst into tears. Her husband, the\r\nGovernor’s son, a handsome, manly fellow, came to her and, putting his\r\narm around her, drew her back to the bed.\r\n\r\n“She’s trying to speak,” he whispered, and for the next moment the\r\ndying woman’s labored breathing was the only sound in the room.\r\n\r\n“Father! Mother!” Mrs. Thompson was hearing her sister’s voice for the\r\nfirst time in twenty-five years. “Brother Thomas! Uncle Frank! Where\r\nare you?”\r\n\r\n“She is thinking of her childhood,” said Edith in a whisper. She bent\r\nover her mother and in a calm, steady voice said:\r\n\r\n“We are all here, mother dear—Susie and Annie and Jasper and I.”\r\n\r\nThere was silence for a moment; then the voice of the dying woman rose\r\nin keen appeal.\r\n\r\n“Martha! Oh, I want Martha—I want Martha!”\r\n\r\nThe two sisters exchanged anxious glances.\r\n\r\n“She means Aunt Martha Thompson,” whispered Susie; “we have not sent\r\nfor her. What shall we do?”\r\n\r\nEdith bent over the pillow.\r\n\r\n“Mother dear——”\r\n\r\n“I want Martha, my sister Martha!” Mrs. Hansard said impatiently, and\r\nshe beat the white coverlet with her thin hand. “Martha, sister Martha,\r\nwhere are you?”\r\n\r\n“Here I am, Melissa.” The gaunt figure rose suddenly, to the surprise\r\nof all, and moved toward the bed. They made room for her. There was no\r\ntime for formal explanations or greetings. “I’m here, Melissa; I heard\r\nyou was sick, an’ ’lowed I’d better drap in.”\r\n\r\n“Thank God!” cried Mrs. Hansard, as she took the hardened hand in her\r\nfrail fingers and tried to press it. “I’ve been prayin’ God to let me\r\nsee you once more. I want you to forgive me, Martha. I’m dying. I’ve\r\ndone you a great wrong. Forgive me, forgive me!”\r\n\r\n“La, me, Melissa, I hain’t a thing to forgive!” was the calm, insistent\r\nreply; “not a blessed thing! It was all as much my doin’ as yore’n. We\r\nwas both jest natural—that’s all—jest natural, like the Lord made\r\nus—me in my way, and you in yore’n.”\r\n\r\nEdith kissed her aunt’s wrinkled cheek gratefully, and, with her cheek\r\non the old woman’s shoulder, she wept silently.\r\n\r\n“I thank God; I feel easier now,” said Mrs. Hansard. “You’ve made me\r\nhappier, Martha. I can die easier now. God is good.”\r\n\r\nSomeone gave Mrs. Thompson a chair, and she sat down and held her\r\nsister’s hand till it was all over. Then the Governor’s son took the\r\nold woman’s arm and led her into the sitting-room, and there the three\r\nmotherless girls joined her.\r\n\r\n“You are much like her,” sobbed Susie, the youngest; “you have her eyes\r\nand mouth.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, folks used to say we favored,” said Mrs. Thompson simply.\r\n\r\n“You must not leave us, Aunt Martha,” said Edith. “We must keep you\r\nwith us. She would like to have it so.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, do, do, Aunt Martha,” chimed in Susie and Annie.\r\n\r\nThe old woman had folded her bonnet in her lap and was holding her\r\nrough hands out to the fire. She smiled as if vaguely pleased, and yet\r\nshe shook her head.\r\n\r\n“No, don’t ax me _that_, girls,” she said. “I’ve got ways an’ habits\r\nthat ain’t one bit like yore’n. I’d feel out o’ place anywhar except\r\nin my cabin. I couldn’t change at my time o’ life. Joe’s workin’ fer\r\nme, an’ he’ll never marry. He hates the sight of a woman. He says they\r\nmeddle. He’s waitin’ fer me now outside, an’ I reckon I ort to be\r\na-goin’.”\r\n\r\n“But not till after—after the funeral,” said Susie.\r\n\r\n“Yes, honey. I don’t think I ort to wait. I’ve got lots to do at home.\r\nMy cows are to feed an’ milk, an’ it’s a long drive. It’ll be in the\r\nnight when we git home. Remember, me an’ yore mother hain’t been\r\nintimate sence we was childern. I’m her sister by blood, but not by\r\nraisin’, an’ I hain’t the same sort o’ mourner as you-uns, an’ don’t\r\nthink I ort to pass as one in public. I wouldn’t feel exactly natural,\r\nthat’s all.”\r\n\r\nThe Governor’s son nodded his head as if he agreed with her, and the\r\ngirls silently gave her her wish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _A Remorseful Regret_\r\n\r\n\r\n“If I’d only married her!” muttered Tanquerly, with the bitter regret\r\nof a lost soul bewailing vanished opportunities.\r\n\r\nI thought of the sweet little wife he had at home, and was swamped with\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n“Oh, if I’d only married her!” he repeated, still more intensely.\r\n\r\nThe woman referred to occupied a seat across and further down the car\r\nfrom us. She had a form that made the ordinary carpenter’s scaffolding\r\nlook graceful and huggable, her jaw reminded one of a trip-hammer, her\r\nface was plotted to throw a nervous child into convulsions, and her\r\nvoice!—her voice would make a busy boiler-factory seem restful and\r\nserene after a second of it. She had just had a slight controversy with\r\nthe conductor, and that official—you know how shy and shrinking the\r\nordinary street-car conductor is—had been reduced to quivering pulp in\r\na trifle over a minute. He, one of the most explosive and overbearing\r\nof his kind, had joined issue with her confidently and gleefully,\r\nbut when her strident voice once got to working full time, about two\r\nhundred and fifty words to the second, I calculated, analyzing his\r\ncharacter, dissecting his reputation, tearing up his habits, unjointing\r\nhis hopes, shredding his ambitions, and ruthlessly forecasting his\r\nfuture, it was pathetic to watch that strong man striving fruitlessly\r\nto stem the torrent, then yielding little by little, still struggling\r\nstrenuously to get in a word, until at last he was swept out on to\r\nthe back platform, a mangled and lacerated bundle of raw nerves, too\r\nbroken-spirited to so much as curse a little fussy old gentleman who\r\nberated him for not stopping the car at his corner. I never saw the\r\nstiffening so thoroughly, quickly and completely taken out of a man in\r\nmy life. Oh, it was pitiable!\r\n\r\n“If I’d only married her!” murmured Tanquerly again.\r\n\r\n“Are you crazy?” I demanded sharply.\r\n\r\nTanquerly shook his head slowly and painfully. “No,” he said, “not\r\nyet. But I’ll bet if I’d only married her I wouldn’t have been to that\r\nbanquet last night and felt like this this morning.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _Nothing to Gain_\r\n\r\nFARMER MOSSBACKER—Are ye goin’ to send your son to college, Ezry?\r\n\r\nFARMER BENTOVER—Hod-durn him—no! He’s a reg’lar rowdy now!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              _Franchise Wealth and Municipal Ownership_\r\n\r\n\r\n                       BY JOHN H. GIRDNER, M.D.\r\n\r\nThere is much writing and talk about _municipal ownership_ in these\r\ndays. When you talk about a municipality or an individual owning\r\nsomething, it implies that there is _something_ to own. It is about\r\nthis “something” that I want to write. I want to make it clear to the\r\nreader what I mean by _franchise wealth_ or _franchise property_, and\r\nexactly how it differs from private wealth or private property.\r\n\r\nWhen you buy a house and lot in a town or city, your property is of two\r\nkinds, private property and franchise property. Your private property\r\nbegins at the building line in front and extends backward the full\r\nwidth of your lot to the fence or line which divides your back yard\r\nfrom the back yard of your neighbor who fronts on the next street. Your\r\nfranchise property extends from the building or stoop line, outward,\r\nthe full width of your lot, across the sidewalk and on to the middle of\r\nthe street where it meets the franchise property of your neighbor on\r\nthe opposite side of your street.\r\n\r\nThe money to grade, drain and pave the street in front of your lot was\r\nraised by assessments levied on that lot. These assessments were added,\r\nby previous owners, perhaps, to the cost of the lot, and were a part\r\nof the price you paid for the lot. In other words, you bought and paid\r\nfor the franchise property in front of your stoop line as directly as\r\nyou did for the private property behind the stoop line, and you are\r\ntherefore entitled to the usufruct of the one as much as the other.\r\n\r\nThe aggregate of the franchise wealth of all the individual owners\r\nin any given street is the sum total of the franchise wealth of that\r\nstreet. And the aggregate of the franchise wealth of all the streets of\r\na given town or city is the sum total of the franchise wealth of that\r\ncity. And it is absolutely owned by all the inhabitants of that city,\r\nfor everyone contributes in some manner to the creation and maintenance\r\nof this franchise wealth.\r\n\r\nThere is another thing about this kind of property which the people\r\nought to keep in mind. Like their private property, their rights in\r\nthis franchise property extend from the surface right down into the\r\nearth, as far as it is practical to dig; and, from the surface, right\r\nup into the sky, as high as it is practical to build. It is well, I\r\nsay, to keep these facts in mind; they may come in handy when a corrupt\r\nmayor and board of aldermen, or an eminently respectable board of rapid\r\ntransit commissioners, are about to hand over to a private corporation\r\na city subway or elevated road.\r\n\r\nThe tremendous importance of the franchise wealth on all social\r\nand economic questions in a city like New York may be more fully\r\nappreciated if we call to mind this fact, viz.:\r\n\r\nThat the value of any piece of city real estate is determined almost\r\nentirely by the character of the franchise property in front of and\r\nnearby it.\r\n\r\nWhy does a lot one hundred feet deep, with twenty-five feet front on\r\nFifth avenue, sell for so much more than a similar lot fronting on\r\nSecond avenue? They are the same size. They are composed alike of earth\r\nand rock. You can dig as deep a foundation and build as high in the\r\nair on the one as the other. But why the great difference in price?\r\nYou say because Fifth avenue is a better street than Second avenue.\r\nBut this answer does not explain much. What you mean to say is, that\r\nthere are certain characteristics, which I have not time to discuss\r\nhere in detail, connected with the franchise property in front of and\r\ncontiguous to the Fifth avenue lot which make it more valuable than\r\nsimilar characteristics connected with the franchise property in front\r\nof and contiguous to the Second avenue lot. And this is my point, that\r\nit is at last the character of the franchise property of a street or a\r\ncity which determines the value of the private property or real estate\r\nof that street or city.\r\n\r\nThe streets of New York City, which I have called franchise wealth\r\nor franchise property to distinguish this kind of property from the\r\nprivate property of the individual, were built and are maintained with\r\nmoney contributed by all the citizens; and all the citizens are as\r\nfully entitled to the usufruct of them, as is any individual to the\r\nusufruct of his private property.\r\n\r\nThe individual manages his private property or he employs an agent to\r\nmanage it for him. And he holds this agent to a strict account. If the\r\nagent appropriates the income from the use of his private property\r\nthe law steps in and justly punishes him. Acting collectively, the\r\nindividuals elect by ballot a mayor and board of aldermen and members\r\nof the State legislature as agents to manage their franchise property\r\nfor them.\r\n\r\n“Wheresoever the carcass is, there will the eagles be gathered\r\ntogether.” In every large city there is a fat carcass of franchise\r\nwealth, and there you find the corporation eagles, and the political\r\neagles gathered together to gorge themselves on it. The corporation\r\neagles deceive the unsuspecting citizens by a pretended desire to serve\r\nthem. They call themselves “public service corporations.” There never\r\nwas a worse misnomer than this. They are wolves in sheep’s clothing.\r\nThey fatten on the people’s franchise wealth and serve no one except\r\nthemselves and their congeners, the political eagles. So far from being\r\n_servants_ they become the masters of the people whose property they\r\nhave obtained by every corrupt device that the vulpine instinct of man\r\ncan invent.\r\n\r\nThe political eagles that feed on the franchise carcass have a\r\ndifferent way of deceiving the people. They organize themselves into\r\nwhat they call a political party, and, by working three hundred\r\nand sixty-five days in the year, while other men are attending to\r\ntheir legitimate businesses, they get control of the legal political\r\nmachinery of one of the great national parties. The name by which\r\nthey call their organization will depend on the particular city they\r\nare operating in. In New York, for instance, they call themselves\r\nDemocrats, not because they know or care anything about the principles\r\nof Democracy, but because a majority of the independent voters are\r\nDemocrats, and then they secure the votes to elect their candidates\r\nfrom the very people they intend to despoil once they get in. For\r\na similar reason the political eagles of Philadelphia call their\r\norganization Republican. If the majority of the voters of any city\r\nfavored prohibition, you would have that city’s organized political\r\neagles calling themselves Prohibitionists. New York, Philadelphia,\r\nChicago, St. Louis, every city in this country which has a fat\r\nfranchise wealth carcass, has its corporation and political eagles\r\ngathered together to devour it.\r\n\r\nWhen a complete history of New York City for the past forty years is\r\nwritten, not the least interesting chapters will be an account of the\r\ndevelopment, growth and present perfection of the system by which the\r\ncorporations and politicians enriched themselves at the expense of the\r\npeople, and how the people were so hypnotized that they were unable\r\nto rise in their might and drive out these cormorants. This era of\r\ncorruption began with William M. Tweed. The enterprise was in its\r\ninfancy then and Tweed was a blunderer. He and his associates robbed\r\nthe city treasury on false vouchers, fraudulent bills, etc. Then came\r\nJake Sharp, who bribed the aldermen outright with cash to induce them\r\nto hand over to him some millions worth of the people’s franchise\r\nwealth. Tweed and his people, Jake Sharp and the boodle aldermen got\r\ninto trouble, state prison or exile.\r\n\r\nPoliticians do not like striped clothes when the stripes all run one\r\nway any better than other folks do. So a new and safer system had to\r\nbe found for exploiting the people. Money in the form of campaign\r\ncontributions from the individual or corporation who wants something\r\nto the head of the organization who could deliver that something after\r\nelection, looked good and safe, and this is the plan which has been in\r\noperation in New York for some years.\r\n\r\nDuring the last mayoralty campaign in this city I was told one\r\nevening by a man who is thoroughly reliable, and who is in a position\r\nto know, that the Consolidated Gas Company, of this city, had paid\r\n$300,000 into the campaign fund of Tammany Hall. George B. McClellan,\r\nthe Tammany candidate for mayor, was elected. In less than one year\r\nafter taking office he signed the so-called Remsen gas bill. Had it\r\nbecome a law it would have tightened the clutch of the Gas Trust more\r\nfirmly on the people of this city and would have turned over to that\r\ncorporation some millions more of their franchise wealth. Fortunately a\r\nRepublican governor vetoed it and saved, for the time at least, further\r\nencroachments on the people’s rights.\r\n\r\nAnd you have today the spectacle of this so-called Democratic mayor\r\nlined up with the Trust magnates and their money-bags at the big ends\r\nof the gas-tubes and against the people of all parties who suffer\r\nextortion at the little ends of the gas-tubes. He is actually opposing\r\nthe efforts of the people of this city to secure the necessary\r\nlegislation to permit them to build and operate their own gas-plants\r\nand deliver the gas to themselves through pipes laid in their own\r\nstreets. And if you refuse to support such a man you are likely to be\r\ntold by an insolent Tammany Hall henchman that you are no Democrat.\r\n\r\nTalk about municipal ownership! Why, the municipality, which is another\r\nname for the people, already own everything they need. They own the\r\nstreets and the right of way through them, and they own the money to\r\nbuild lighting plants, railways and telephone lines. The only thing\r\nthey do not own is _permission_ to use their own property. And this is\r\nwithheld from them by greedy Trust magnates through their bought-up\r\npoliticians.\r\n\r\nWe need MEN in this city who cannot be deceived by the _names_\r\nDemocracy and Republicanism. We need men who will stand together\r\nand protect our franchise property against grafting politicians and\r\ngrafting political organizations, no matter by what names they call\r\nthemselves. New York City may be likened to a big “skyscraper” laid\r\non its side. The streets correspond to the elevator shafts. Now, what\r\nwould be thought of the sanity of a company of men who built a high\r\noffice building, hotel or apartment house and allowed their agents to\r\ngive away to outsiders the right to run the elevators and the further\r\nright to prey upon the tenants who are obliged to use them? Yet this is\r\nexactly what the politicians have done and are doing with the streets\r\nof this city.\r\n\r\nMake an inventory of the Gas Trust’s property, find out how much it\r\nwould cost to duplicate its plant, then subtract that sum from the\r\ncapitalization of the Trust and the remainder is franchise property,\r\nand that belongs to the people. Go through the list of telephone,\r\ntelegraph and railway companies the same way, and you will begin to get\r\nan idea of the value and earning capacity of your franchise property\r\nwhich has been stolen from you by your agents, the officeholders.\r\n\r\nIf the agent of an individual deeds away a piece of his private\r\nproperty and fails to make a just return to the owner, the law\r\nholds the title to be spurious and punishes that agent. But the\r\nofficeholders, the agents appointed by all the individuals to care for\r\ntheir franchise property, deed it away to so-called public service\r\ncorporations, pocket the proceeds and go scot-free!\r\n\r\nThe telephone, telegraph and all the corporations that use wires and\r\nelectricity appropriate and use the people’s private property as\r\nwell as their franchise property. Go on your roofs, New Yorkers, and\r\ncount the electric wires that the thieving electricity corporations\r\nhave attached to your houses or have strung across your lots without\r\nyour permission. Remember that you own a space equal to the surface\r\ndimensions of your lot down into the bowels of the earth and up into\r\nthe sky as far as you like to go. And nobody has the right to string\r\nwires across this space in the air or in the earth without your\r\npermission. The New York Telephone Company attached a wire to the roof\r\nof a house I had leased. I threatened to cut the wire. The company\r\ninsolently replied that they needed that wire on my roof to carry on\r\ntheir business. I insisted on justice and my rights in the matter.\r\nThe company then came round with a lease, which I signed, granting\r\nthem permission to pass their wire over my roof, and I received a\r\nsubstantial annual rental for that privilege.\r\n\r\nThese corporations appropriate your private property as well as your\r\nfranchise property for their own enrichment and pay nothing for it.\r\nThey would string wires on your teeth if they needed them and you did\r\nnot object. And to cap the climax they charge extortionate rates for\r\nservice in order to pay dividends on watered stock. I wrote these facts\r\na few years ago and offered the article to two daily newspapers in\r\nthis town, and they did not dare to publish it. But thank God TOM\r\nWATSON’S MAGAZINE exists to tell the truth. New Yorkers, you ought\r\nto examine the fences around your backyards. You surely own them, and\r\nthey are valuable property. They produce an enormous income to—the\r\ntelephone company. Tens of thousands of yards of telephone wires are\r\nstrung on these fences. The company uses them to get wires into your\r\nhouses, in order to charge you extortionate prices for ’phone service.\r\nThe company will tell you they need these fences to give _you_ ’phone\r\nservice. That answer reminds me of the answer given by a negro girl\r\ncaught stealing raisins from her mistress’s bureau drawer. “Why did you\r\nsteal those raisins?” asked the mistress. Sally replied, “Why, missus,\r\ndey’s good.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 _The Cause of the Congregating_\r\n\r\n“MY friends,” began the Great Man, in a voice admirably adapted for\r\ndeclamatory purposes, as he stepped out upon the platform of the car\r\nand beheld the major portion of the inhabitants of the wayside hamlet\r\nseething and jostling around the station, “I thank you from the bottom\r\nof my heart for this enthusiastic greeting, this spontaneous outpouring\r\nof your best citizens, this wholesale welcome, this——”\r\n\r\n“Wholesale gran’mother!” broke in a youthful and pessimistic voice.\r\n“It ain’t you that’s the attraction—a big fat drummer is havin’ the\r\ngol-rammedest fit you ever had the pleasure of witnessin’, right there\r\nin the waitin’-room!”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                        _That Fateful Day_\r\n\r\nFREDDIE—How long does the honeymoon last, dad?\r\n\r\nCOBWIGGER—Until a fellow’s wife learns not to be afraid of him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _The Storm-Petrel_\r\n\r\n\r\n                       PROSE POEM BY MAXIM GORKY\r\n                      TRANSLATED BY ABRAHAM CAHAN\r\n\r\n        [NOTE: The following prose poem by Maxim\r\n      Gorky was written a few years ago in prophecy of\r\n      the present crisis in Russia and was published\r\n      only in _Life_, the leading literary magazine of\r\n      St. Petersburg. In consequence the periodical was\r\n      immediately suppressed. The editor and his entire\r\n      staff voluntarily expatriated themselves and\r\n      re-established the magazine in London, whence, during\r\n      the few months of its existence in exile, thousands\r\n      of copies were smuggled over the frontier for secret\r\n      circulation.\r\n\r\n        Gorky was arrested for complicity in the strikers’\r\n      movement that resulted in the St. Petersburg massacre\r\n      of January 22 last.

Circling\r\nbetween the clouds and the sea, like a black flash of lightning, is the\r\nstorm-petrel on high.\r\n\r\nNow touching a wave with his wing, now shooting heavenward, dart-like,\r\nhe is crying, and the clouds hear glad tidings in his cry.\r\n\r\nThere is thirst for storm in that cry. The force of rage, the flame of\r\npassion, the confidence of victory do the clouds hear in that cry.\r\n\r\nThe gulls are groaning before the storm, groaning and tossing over the\r\nsea; ready to hide their terror at the bottom of the sea.\r\n\r\nThe cargeese, too, are groaning. The joy of the struggle is unknown to\r\nthem; the din of strife awes them.\r\n\r\nThe silly albatross hides his fat body in the cliffs. The proud\r\nstorm-petrel alone is soaring boldly, freely over the sea, the waves\r\nsinging, dancing on high, coming to meet the thunder.\r\n\r\nThe thunder roars. Foaming with fury, the waves are raging, battling\r\nwith the wind. Now the wind seizes a flock of waves in gigantic\r\nembrace, now hurls them with savage hate to the rocks, shattering them\r\nto dust and masses of emerald spray.\r\n\r\nShouting joyously, the storm-petrel is circling like a black flash of\r\nlightning, piercing the clouds like a spear, brushing foam off the\r\nwaves with its wings.\r\n\r\nThere he is, flying like a demon, a proud, black storm-demon, laughing\r\nand sobbing at once. It is at the clouds he is laughing; it is for joy\r\nhe is sobbing.\r\n\r\nIn the thunder’s rage the sensitive demon perceives a weary note, the\r\nvoice of defeat. He knows that the clouds cannot conceal the sun—not\r\nthey!\r\n\r\nThe wind is sighing; the thunder is pealing. Hundreds of clouds gleam\r\nbluish over the precipice of the sea. The sea is catching darts of\r\nlightning and smothering them in its bosom. Like serpents of fire the\r\nreflections of the lightning are writhing, vanishing one after the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThe storm is advancing! Another minute and the storm will come with a\r\ncrash.\r\n\r\nIt is the intrepid storm-petrel who is proudly careering among the\r\nflashes of lightning over the roaring, infuriated sea; it is the\r\nprophet of victory who is shouting.\r\n\r\nLet the storm blow and roar with all its might!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _What Buzz-Saw Morgan Thinks_\r\n\r\n\r\n                            BY W. S. MORGAN\r\n\r\nTrusts breed distrust.\r\n\r\nLaw cannot make wrong right.\r\n\r\nCharity is no cure for poverty; it is only a plaster.\r\n\r\nA forty-three-cent protective tariff is worse than a fifty-cent dollar.\r\n\r\nFiat dollars are better than the fiat promises of the old party\r\npoliticians.\r\n\r\nThe rich will continue to grow richer and the poor poorer as long as\r\nthe present financial system exists.\r\n\r\nI want to ask our Democratic friends how often do they need to be\r\nfooled by their leaders before they will get their eyes open?\r\n\r\nLiberty is not safe in a country where greed and avarice are the basis\r\nof its prosperity.\r\n\r\nThe gold power owes allegiance to no party, yet it controls the\r\nmachines of both old parties.\r\n\r\nIf there is anything that is calculated to give the political bosses\r\nthe jim-jams it is a show of independence on the part of the masses.\r\n\r\nI would rather be a dog and scratch at the root of a stump for a mouse,\r\nthan to feel as small as most rich people do when the assessor and\r\ntax-collector come round.\r\n\r\nMoney paid out for public improvements is a blessing compared with that\r\npaid out for war expenses.\r\n\r\nAn honest dollar is one that preserves the equity in contracts, and not\r\nthe one of increasing or decreasing value, or whose value depends upon\r\nthe caprice or self-interest of a few bankers.\r\n\r\nThe greatest need of this country is for about seven million men who\r\nhave the courage to vote for what they want.\r\n\r\n“The poverty of the poor is their destruction,” and the wealth of the\r\nrich has the same effect on its possessors. These two extremes are the\r\ncause of the downfall of the nations.\r\n\r\nThere are some things of which there can be an overproduction, and one\r\nof them is yellow-dog politics.\r\n\r\nIs there a farmer or laborer in all the land that ever signed a\r\npetition to Congress for the destruction of the greenbacks?\r\n\r\nThe question of 16 to 1 is still an issue; that is, there are sixteen\r\nreasons why the Democratic party should permit itself to be buried to\r\none against it.\r\n\r\nThe banks are in the field to destroy the greenbacks and secure\r\ncomplete control of the currency.\r\n\r\nIt is not despair but hope that incites revolution. Despair is death.\r\n\r\nThe workingmen divide what they produce with every idler in the land,\r\nrich and poor.\r\n\r\nThe way to get even with a private trust is for the people to establish\r\na public trust.\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t the so-called “sound money” men that saved the flag.\r\n\r\nIt is the hog nature in man that causes most of the suffering in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nOur commercial system rests upon the basis of skinning the other fellow\r\nbefore he has an opportunity to skin us.\r\n\r\nOne of the strongest planks in the devil’s platform is yellow-dog\r\npolitics.\r\n\r\nThe best way to abolish poverty is to establish justice.\r\n\r\nYou can’t cheat the devil by passing a law that calls stealing business.\r\n\r\nThe lower classes are those who act low—rich or poor.\r\n\r\nThe practice of redeeming one kind of a dollar with another kind\r\nconstitutes the banker’s cinch.\r\n\r\nThe harmony that will likely prevail in the next national Democratic\r\nconvention might best be illustrated by pouring out a barrel of\r\nKilkenny cats upon a wet floor.\r\n\r\nI don’t think that Mr. Bryan is a thief, but he had the Populist\r\nplatform borrowed so long that he has perhaps inadvertently fallen into\r\nthe habit of thinking it is his own.\r\n\r\nRailroads under private ownership form the strongest prop on which the\r\ntrusts lean. Through special and reduced rates in the way of rebates\r\nthey are enabled to freeze out all competitors.\r\n\r\nIt is stated that the rebate given to the Colorado Fuel and Iron\r\nCompany by the Santa Fé Railroad while Paul Morton was its traffic\r\nmanager amounted to $400,000 a year. Morton was a heavy stockholder\r\nin the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company. If this is true, and this is\r\nthe kind of man President Roosevelt is depending on to reform railroad\r\nrates and abolish rebates, we may know just what to expect.\r\n\r\nThe supreme test of any question is, is it right? If it is, then no man\r\nshould hesitate to declare himself for the right.\r\n\r\nDirect legislation is the very essence of democracy, and that is why\r\nthe politicians don’t want it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf Thomas Lawson is telling the truth it appears that about\r\nthree-fourths of the Captains of Industry ought to be wearing striped\r\nclothes behind prison bars.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe President’s recommendation for the control of the railroads, and\r\nthe plan he seems to have adopted to go about it, consultation with\r\nthe railroad magnates, reminds me of a story I once heard related by a\r\nGerman speaker at a public meeting. A man who had been considered as\r\nhaving an unsound mind was found one morning hanging to a beam in the\r\nbarn, the rope under his arms. He was promptly cut down, and on being\r\nasked why he hanged himself that way he answered that he was trying to\r\ncommit suicide.\r\n\r\n“But why didn’t you place the rope around your neck?” he was asked.\r\n\r\n“I’ve tried it that way twice,” he replied, “and it always chokes me.”\r\n\r\nIs the President afraid of choking the railroad corporations?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe question of how to get something for nothing is pretty well\r\nillustrated in the free government deposits in national banks. The\r\nbanks have now over one hundred millions of dollars of government\r\nmoney for their own use, for which they do not pay a cent. Yet when\r\nthe farmer talks about borrowing money from the government on his land\r\nat 2 per cent. interest, the banks raise a howl of paternalism that\r\ncan be heard all around the world. If President Roosevelt is sincere\r\nin his fight on the trusts let him yank that money out of the hands of\r\nthe biggest trust of all—the money trust. This is something that he\r\ncan do and that ought to be done. There is no constitutional question\r\ninvolved, and if it be urged that it is necessary for the money to be\r\nin circulation let the government loan it direct to the people without\r\na rake-off for the banks. This thing of prosecuting the little trusts\r\nand aiding the big ones won’t add any laurels to Teddy’s brow. Let no\r\nguilty trust escape, and there ain’t any innocent ones.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nToledo has just brought in a batch of indictments against some of her\r\npublic officials. Governor Durbin, of Indiana, declares: “Statistics\r\nof political debauchery in this State for 1904, if it were possible\r\nto present them, would be nothing short of stunning.” Several other\r\ngovernors in their messages have called attention to the growth of\r\ncorruption in their States, and in Colorado the situation is alarming.\r\nThree United States senators have been indicted within the past year,\r\nbesides scores of lesser officials, some of whom are now serving terms\r\nin the penitentiary. Four Republican candidates for governor have been\r\ndefeated in Republican States on account of their connection or\r\nsympathy with corrupt practices, and yet the work is only begun. Let\r\nthe crusade against political corruption continue. If there is not room\r\nenough in the jails, I move that some of the horse thieves be turned\r\nout and the public thieves turned in.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe express companies once had a monopoly of transmitting money and\r\ncharged exorbitant rates for the service. Then the government went\r\ninto the business and reduced the rates. The express companies were\r\ncompelled to come to the government rates or not get any business.\r\nThus money is saved to the people, and the business is established on\r\na firm basis. Of course the express companies set up the usual cry of\r\npaternalism, but it did no good, and the people would not think now of\r\nsurrendering this prerogative to private companies. Now, why can’t the\r\ngovernment add to its postal system the carrying of parcels, say up to\r\nten or twelve pounds’ weight, and a telegraph and telephone system?\r\nThe latter are just as legitimate and necessary as the former. Is it\r\nbecause the express companies, that have grown immensely rich, have a\r\nlobby in Congress to prevent the passage of such a bill? In England\r\nthey have the parcels post and the government telegraph, and they\r\nsave the people millions of dollars. In the past few years nineteen\r\ncongressional committees have been appointed to investigate the use of\r\nthe telegraph in connection with the postal department and seventeen\r\nof them have reported favorably toward establishing it. A majority of\r\nPostmaster Generals have recommended it, and the people demand it, yet\r\nthe telegraph companies, or rather one company which is controlled by\r\none family, has been successful in thwarting all legislation toward the\r\nestablishment of a government telegraph system.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe readiness of the Democrats to vote for any old thing they see coming\r\ndown the pike with the Democratic label on—Parker or Bryan, the gold\r\nstandard or free silver—reminds me of an incident that happened down\r\nin Texas. A wealthy farmer who employed a great many negroes was going\r\ninto town one day, and one of the negroes on the farm asked him to\r\nbring him back a marriage license.\r\n\r\n“All right, Pete,” said the farmer, “but what’s the girl’s name?”\r\n\r\n“Ann Brown,” replied the darkey.\r\n\r\nWhen the farmer returned that evening he gave the negro his marriage\r\nlicense.\r\n\r\nPete took it and slowly read it over.\r\n\r\n“Look heah, Marse Henry, you’se done gone an’ got dis license fer Mary\r\nClarke. I’se gwine t’ marry Ann Brown.”\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry, Pete,” the farmer replied, “but never mind; when I go into\r\ntown again next week I’ll get you another license.”\r\n\r\n“What’ll dat cost?” asked Pete.\r\n\r\n“One dollar.”\r\n\r\n“Lordy, nebber mind, Marse. Dere ain’t a dollar’s wuff ob difference\r\n’tween all de coons on de fa’m.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEvery effort is now being put forth by the banks to have the greenbacks\r\nretired. So long as they continue to be issued by the government the\r\nbanks have not complete control of the money of the country. This\r\nmovement to retire the greenbacks was begun directly after the Civil\r\nWar. At that time the bankers said: “It will not do to allow the\r\ngreenback, as it is called, to circulate as money for any length of\r\ntime, for we cannot control that.” Hugh McCulloch, then Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury, acting on the bankers’ suggestion, said: “The first thing\r\nto be done is to establish the policy of contraction.” It was done,\r\nand we had the panic of 1873, on account of which thousands lost their\r\nhomes. The panic aroused the people and caused the bankers to pause\r\nin their conspiracy. The Greenback party came and $346,000,000 in\r\ngreenbacks were saved from destruction. But in the meantime the bankers\r\nhad silver secretly demonetized. In 1878, however, it was partially\r\nrestored by the Bland-Allison law. But the bankers were still at work.\r\nIn October, 1877, the famous Buell circular letter was sent to the\r\nbankers throughout the country. “It is advisable,” said this circular,\r\n“to do all in your power to sustain such prominent daily and weekly\r\nnewspapers, especially the agricultural and religious press, as will\r\noppose the issuing of greenback paper money, and that you also withhold\r\npatronage or favors from all applicants who are not willing to oppose\r\nthe government issue of money. Let the government issue the coin and\r\nthe banks issue the paper money of the country, for then we can better\r\nprotect each other.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn March, 1893, the American Bankers’ Association sent out to all the\r\nnational banks what is known as the “panic circular.” In view of the\r\npresent efforts on the part of the banks to retire the greenbacks, this\r\ncircular furnishes some very good reading matter:\r\n\r\n        DEAR SIR: The interests of national\r\n      bankers require immediate financial legislation by\r\n      Congress. Silver, silver certificates and Treasury\r\n      notes must be retired and national bank-notes upon a\r\n      gold basis made the only money. This will require the\r\n      authorization of from $500,000,000 to $1,000,000,000\r\n      of new bonds as a basis of circulation. You will at\r\n      once retire one-third of your circulation and call in\r\n      one-half of your loans. Be careful to make a money\r\n      stringency felt among your patrons, especially among\r\n      influential business men. Advocate an extra session\r\n      of Congress for the repeal of the purchasing clause\r\n      of the Sherman law, and act with the other banks of\r\n      your city in securing a large petition to Congress\r\n      for its unconditional repeal, as per accompanying\r\n      form. Use personal influence with congressmen and\r\n      particularly let your wishes be known to senators.\r\n      The future life of national banks as safe investments\r\n      depends upon immediate action, as there is an\r\n      increasing sentiment in favor of government legal\r\n      tender notes and silver coinage.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone but the bankers themselves, and their paid agents, believe\r\nfor a moment that it would be safe to surrender the control of the\r\ncurrency of the country into the hands of men who would put out such a\r\ncircular as that? May we not conjecture what they would do when once\r\nthey had us in their power? If there are those who are in doubt about\r\nthis question, or the patriotism and honesty of the national bankers,\r\nlet them read the history of the panics of 1873 and 1893, both of which\r\nwere precipitated by the bankers. Let the government take the bankers\r\nat their word and compel them to keep in their banks a reserve gold\r\nfund for the redemption of their own notes. Abolish the gold reserve\r\nin the Treasury and make every greenback a perpetual, absolute money,\r\nreceivable for all dues to the United States, and a legal tender for\r\nthe payment of private debts. In other words, put the banks where the\r\ngovernment is now, if they are to issue any notes at all, and give the\r\ngovernment the prerogatives which the banks now want, and some of which\r\nthey already have. Instead of the government loaning money to the banks\r\nat one-fourth of one per cent., let it loan it to the people direct\r\nat two per cent. Instead of the government maintaining a large supply\r\nof gold for the benefit of the banks, let the banks furnish their own\r\ngold for the redemption of their notes, and compel them to maintain\r\na 100-cent reserve, for a note that has only 50 cents behind it is\r\nworse than any 50-cent dollar that the banker has ever conjured in his\r\nmind. Money issued by the banks and that issued by the government are\r\nentirely different propositions. If the banks have proved anything they\r\nhave proved too much. They have proved that the government credit is\r\nthe best in the world, that it will even make the note of a dishonest\r\nbanker good. They have proved that it would not be safe to place the\r\ncontrol of the currency into their hands, for they might at any time\r\nissue another panic circular asking the banks to call in “one-third of\r\ntheir circulation and one-half of their loans,” and a lot of other mean\r\nthings that an honest man and a patriot would not do. The question is\r\nnow up, and it is nearing the climax where the people must decide as to\r\nwhether the banks will control the currency of the country, and through\r\nit the business of the country, or whether the power shall remain in\r\nthe hands of the people, as Jefferson says, “where it belongs.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _A Family Necessity_\r\n\r\n\r\n“James,” said Mrs. Talkyerdeth, as she discontentedly jabbed her\r\nhatpins into the hat she had just taken off, “one of us has got to be\r\noperated on.”\r\n\r\n“Wha-at!” ejaculated Mr. Talkyerdeth, sitting up with a jolt.\r\n\r\n“And right away, and seriously, too,” continued Mrs. Talkyerdeth,\r\nsetting her lips firmly.\r\n\r\n“What are you talking about, Maria?” demanded Mr. Talkyerdeth\r\nimpatiently.\r\n\r\n“Well, it’s so,” asserted Mrs. Talkyerdeth decidedly. “Will you\r\ntelephone for a surgeon, or shall I?”\r\n\r\n“Why, my dear,” protested Mr. Talkyerdeth anxiously, “I hadn’t the\r\nleast suspicion that there was anything the matter with you.”\r\n\r\n“There isn’t,” snapped Mrs. Talkyerdeth. “Do you take me for one of\r\nthese puling, pasty, putty-like females all the women seem to be\r\nnowadays?”\r\n\r\n“Well, there’s nothing the matter with me, either,” asserted Mr.\r\nTalkyerdeth, with intense relief in every glad accent. “I never felt\r\nbetter in my life than I do this minute.”\r\n\r\n“I know it. But what difference does that make?” demanded Mrs.\r\nTalkyerdeth sharply.\r\n\r\n“Eh?” cried Mr. Talkyerdeth, his eyelids flying up and his lower jaw\r\ndropping down until there seemed to be some danger of their colliding,\r\nif they kept on, in the middle of the back of his head.\r\n\r\n“I never was so mortified in my life as I was at the sewing society\r\nthis afternoon, and it’s never going to happen again,” replied Mrs.\r\nTalkyerdeth positively. “So you can just make up your mind that the\r\ndoctor is going to chop something, I don’t care what, out of one of us\r\nright straight off. Why, every woman there was telling all about either\r\nher own or her husband’s operation, and I had to sit with my mouth shut\r\nall afternoon, just because we’ve never had one!”\r\n\r\n                                       ALEX.

The card parties had\r\nbroken up half an hour before, nightcap drinks had been ordered,\r\ntumblers had been emptied, and half a dozen men had risen to their feet\r\nwith “Good night” upon their lips. It looked as if the long-suffering\r\nattendant were to be allowed a real six hours’ sleep below.\r\n\r\nAnd then a single word—“fishing”—had changed all these bright\r\nprospects in the twinkling of an eye. The globe-trotting Englishman,\r\nMathers, was vaunting the fifty-six-pound salmon he had caught in the\r\nSands River, British Columbia. It seemed that not a man in the room\r\ncould take to his bed in peace till he had confuted the boaster from\r\nstores of personal experience. Fresh cigars were lit, tumblers were\r\nrefilled, and story climbed upon story in unctuous mendacity.\r\n\r\nMuller, the German bagman, bumbled tales of Baltic sturgeon that would\r\nmake two bites of the British Columbian salmon if they encountered them\r\nafter breakfast time; Morehead, fresh from Florida, smiled superiorly\r\nas he told of one-hundred-and-fifty-pound tarpon, caught with a line\r\nand rod, of the weight of a walking-cane; Rivaz, the creole, asked what\r\nwas the matter with a two-hundred-weight tuna that it should score\r\nsecond place to what was nothing more than a glorified herring? Across\r\nthe clouds of smoke romance answered to romance; falsehood was fought\r\nwith its own weapons.\r\n\r\nFinally Morehead, abandoning his earliest illustration, harked back to\r\nthe land from which it was drawn. Alligators—had any one of them\r\nenjoyed the sport of hanging a looped line over an alligator run, and\r\nopening a manhole through the earth upon their lairs? That was fishing\r\nif you liked, with the odds upon the fish! Till you had joined in the\r\ntug which yanked a fighting saurian ashore you didn’t know what human\r\nmuscles could stand—you might go shark-fishing every day of your life,\r\nand miss learning it.\r\n\r\nThe suddenness of the topic left him, for the moment, master of the\r\nfield. Professional liars, hurriedly reviewing their conversational\r\nequipments, found themselves with no better weapon than an already\r\nover-tempered imagination. None of them had been in Florida—none could\r\nsupply the substratum of fact which alone is a true foundation for\r\nconvincing fiction.\r\n\r\nThen a new voice shattered the periods of Morehead’s triumph. In the\r\ncorner, with one foot banked against the table and the other stretched\r\nacross the lounge, sat a long and lanky graybeard, his extended limbs\r\ngiving him something of the effect of a pair of human compasses. So far\r\nhe had added nothing to the conversation.\r\n\r\n“Say, now, my dear sir,” he drawled plaintively, “you know you have not\r\ngot any _real_ alligators in Florida.”\r\n\r\nThe young man’s face grew purple.\r\n\r\n“Not got any!” he blared. “Not got any!”\r\n\r\n“Not to call _alligators_!” persisted the veteran complacently. “What,\r\nnow, would be your idea of the length, breadth and jaw-capacity of one\r\nof your little pets?”\r\n\r\nThe youth drew a calculating breath and eyed his questioner narrowly.\r\n\r\n“I assisted, a short time back, to capture one eighteen feet long,”\r\nhe lied coldly. The man on the lounge accepted the statement with a\r\npatronizing little nod.\r\n\r\n“There now!” he agreed. “It just bears out what I say. Nowadays there\r\naren’t any of a size to _call_ alligators. When _I_ was in Florida,\r\nit might be forty or it might be fifty years ago, that kind of small\r\nfry were reckoned in among the lizards. When we went hunting what the\r\nNew York manufacturers call crocodile leather, anything less than four\r\nfathoms from tail-tip to smile we shouldered out of the way. One of\r\nthirty feet, I allow, we considered a circumstance.”\r\n\r\nA murmur rustled up from the assembly. Even the steward’s unconscious\r\ngrimace spoke of incredulity.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” continued the old man pleasantly. “I see your eyebrows rise,\r\nbut that won’t prevent my assuring you that my recollections don’t\r\nstop there. For over a year I had the personal acquaintance of one\r\nthat measured from end to end not a single inch less than twelve slimy\r\nyards. But that,” he allowed generously, “was not in Florida.”\r\n\r\n“Barnum’s Museum?” suggested Morehead contemptuously, and the listeners\r\ngrinned. The veteran was not put out.\r\n\r\n“No,” he contradicted, “not even in the United States. Yet, at the same\r\ntime, not so far from home. In Cuba—to be explicit.”\r\n\r\nThere was a shout of derision. Not less than six of those present had\r\nbeen volunteers in the war.\r\n\r\n“Cuba!” they bawled in chorus. “There isn’t a crocodile in the island\r\nthat would crowd a bathtub!” added Morehead defiantly.\r\n\r\nThe graybeard eyed them serenely.\r\n\r\n“Of course,” he said, with a humble note of interrogation, “you’re\r\nposted—you know every inch of the country from Baracoa to Corrientes?”\r\n\r\nMorehead moved a little restlessly.\r\n\r\n“I was three months around Santiago with my regiment,” said he.\r\n\r\n“And spent every spare second examining the creeks, I don’t doubt,”\r\nsaid the other cheerfully. “My boy,” he went on, “I had been five\r\nyears in the country before you began to attend kindergarten. In those\r\ndays the fame of the Blique Bayou alligator was known to every soul\r\nwithin a hundred miles of Guantanama. I don’t mind allowing that the\r\nname of Everett P. Banks—which is what I’m called when I’m at home,\r\ngentlemen—was a good deal in men’s mouths about the same time. We were\r\nmuch mixed up together, one way or another, that astounding beast and\r\nI.”\r\n\r\nThe steward leaned his head upon his palms, and swore gently beneath\r\nhis breath. He told himself that this evil old man was about to knock\r\nanother half-hour off the night’s rest. He recognized in the gray eyes\r\na triumphant light—the gleam that illumines the face of the raconteur\r\nwhose audience is assured.\r\n\r\nMorehead was still dissatisfied.\r\n\r\n“Blique Bayou?” he repeated superciliously. “Blique Bayou?”\r\n\r\nBanks nodded with an indulgent air.\r\n\r\n“On the map it appears as the San Antonio River,” he explained, “and\r\nit flows into the sea about a mile to the west of the Buena Esperanza\r\nMining Company’s settlement. As it was notorious that Emil Blique, the\r\nWest Indian, owned all the shares, the hill that was topped by the\r\nshafting was called Blique Mountain, and the creek and swamp around it\r\nBlique Bayou. For five years I was manager of the whole outfit. And a\r\nknock-kneed crowd they were,” he added reminiscently.\r\n\r\nMathers interrupted. It looked as if the narrative were going to jump\r\nthe tracks to be wrecked on outside issues.\r\n\r\n“The alligator,” he insisted. “We want the tale of the alligator!”\r\n\r\nThe old man stared at him in gentle surprise.\r\n\r\n“You wouldn’t keep a man of my age out of his berth to tell you yarns\r\nthirty years old?” he deprecated.\r\n\r\n“We would,” said Mathers determinedly. “What’s yours?”\r\n\r\nStartled out of his equanimity, the ancient allowed that so far he\r\nhad encountered nothing to abash whisky—plain. But as for the story\r\nat that time of night—well, well, they needn’t make all that noise.\r\nIf it had to be done he supposed he had better get to it as quickly\r\nas possible. He paused, took a gulp at the tumbler the steward\r\nplaced before him, and let a meditative glance dwell upon Morehead,\r\nwho had made a motion to rise. Catching his eye, the Floridian\r\nsuddenly abandoned his purpose, and sat down in a pose of exasperated\r\nresignation.\r\n\r\n“It was somewhere about ’81—or it might be ’82,” began the old man,\r\nanchoring his gaze mildly upon Morehead’s uncompromising features,\r\n“that I landed at Santiago from Savannah, with a letter in my pocket\r\nfrom my late employer, George S. Gage, to Señor Emil Blique, Buena\r\nEsperanza; the letter and myself being respectively part answers to\r\na wild telegram that my boss had received ten days before. The West\r\nIndian had cabled that his manager had died of yellow fever, and that\r\nhe was alone with nothing but creole help to drive the congregation of\r\nhard-shell niggers and dagos that he paid to grub manganese from the\r\nbowels of the earth.\r\n\r\n“He wanted a man, he said, with a knowledge of mining and with two\r\nworking fists. He laid particular stress upon the second qualification,\r\nand offered such a one three hundred dollars a month to come at the\r\nearliest opportunity.\r\n\r\n“Gage told me that if I’d the spirit of a louse I’d run along and take\r\nit. Otherwise, he said, he’d offer it to Altsheler, the under manager,\r\nwho was a wicked man behind a pistol, but with no kind of idea of using\r\nfour fingers and a thumb when the gun got lost. That’s a terrible fault\r\namong dagos. They are frightened of a knock-down blow, because they\r\ndon’t understand it. But when you start gunning among them—well, they\r\ncan gun and knife themselves—some.\r\n\r\n“You mightn’t think it, gentlemen, but in those days I’d a fist like\r\na ham, and I concluded, after consideration, that the job was built\r\nfor my particular talents and not for Altsheler’s. Ten days after that\r\ntelegram arrived I was bumping along the trail to Blique Mountain,\r\nwondering just how hard those three hundred dollars would be to collect\r\nat the end of every four weeks.\r\n\r\n“I needn’t have troubled. For a Jamaican, old Emil was as straight a\r\nman as I have ever known. His cheque was good money every time I cashed\r\nit, and, when I’d got the hang of the business, fairly easy earned.\r\nDuring the first fortnight I filled an eye for two mine hands _per\r\ndiem_, and by the end of that time the crowd began to understand just\r\nwhere their best interest lay. They reasoned it out that they’d have\r\nto do as they were told, and after that things went like clockwork.\r\nWhen I’d got them really tame, indeed, I found that I could slack off\r\nin the afternoons when old man Blique was moving about himself, and so\r\nI looked around for relaxation. Like all of you, I was something of a\r\nfisherman.\r\n\r\n“Naturally, I turned my steps toward the bayou, and it was there that\r\nI made the acquaintance of Pedro Garsia, Concepcion, his son, and the\r\nother member of the family, as I must call him, for from every point\r\nof view, he was treated like a relation. I allude to my friend Joaquin\r\nel Legardo—Jimmy the Alligator, in the vernacular—and he, I repeat,\r\nwas every inch of thirty-six feet long. I dare say he was a hundred and\r\nfifty years old, and he led a more or less blameless existence in the\r\nswamp and stream adjacent to the Garsia bungalow.\r\n\r\n“At first, though, it looked as if our relations might be strained. I’d\r\ngot down to the bank, fitted up my rod and cast a speculative lump of\r\nfrog’s flesh into the water just to see if anything sizeable was on the\r\nmove. No sooner had I made the cast than there was a boil and a rush\r\n’way out in midstream, and an ugly dun snout bobbed above the surface\r\nand took down my bait and half my line before I realized what was\r\nhappening. It didn’t take me long to understand. I saw the great jaws\r\nopen and champ viciously on the good catgut that was tangled in the\r\nyellow teeth, and I said a wicked word. Also I drew my revolver. Before\r\nI’d got it cocked I heard a terrible uproar from behind.\r\n\r\n“An old man, with silver-white hair hanging over a chocolate-brown\r\nface, was running toward me, shouting as if he’d break a blood vessel.\r\n\r\n“‘No shoot!’ he bawled, ‘no shoot!’ and he waved his arms with some of\r\nthe most complete gesticulations I have ever witnessed. I put down my\r\npistol and waited till he arrived panting.\r\n\r\n“He was too much out of breath to say much at first, but what he did\r\nmanage to whisper was to the point. ‘_Bueno legardo_—_bueno_,’ he\r\nrepeated, pointing to the brute that was playing cat’s-cradle with my\r\nfishing line, and then, tapping the butt of my revolver, ‘no shoot—no!’\r\n\r\n“I can tell you I was mystified, for the idea of a _good_ alligator,\r\nas he kept calling it, was outside the pale of my experiences. I told\r\nhim so. But he nodded and beckoned and led me down the bank a couple\r\nof hundred yards till we were opposite his house. There I found a rope\r\nstretched between two stumps across the river, with a loop running on\r\nit, and this last was lashed to the bow of a pirogue.\r\n\r\n“‘This mine,’ he explained, smiling. ‘This what you call a ferry.’ I\r\nlooked at the boat. Then I remembered that coming up from Santiago the\r\nroad had circled widely. Blique Mountain had been in sight a good hour\r\nbefore we reached it and my driver had made me understand that we were\r\navoiding the river. This was evidently the short cut for foot travelers.\r\n\r\n“‘If this is the ferry, why in the name of gracious don’t you let\r\nme fill that old pirate with lead?’ I asked, as the brute floated\r\ncomfortably by. ‘Not that he’d mind,’ I added, as I realized the size\r\nof him, ‘but you should get a howitzer and pump a six-pound ball\r\nthrough him. Some day, when your catboat’s full of people, he’ll upset\r\nit and fill his larder for a fortnight.’\r\n\r\n“The old man smiled agreeably and put his head on one side like a\r\nmagpie. He cocked me a comical look out of the corner of his eye.\r\n\r\n‘This river not deep,’ he explained glibly. ‘This what you call ford\r\none time,’ and he pointed toward the eddies that swirled between us and\r\nthe opposite bank. I could see that they were running over shallows\r\nnowhere more than four feet deep. And at that the old chap toddled into\r\nthe house and reappeared with a basket load of decaying lizard flesh.\r\nHe came close to me and gave me a little nudge.\r\n\r\n“‘Ford one time,’ he repeated, taking a lump of offal and tossing\r\nit into the stream. Then he gave me another nudge, and grinned.\r\n‘Joaquin—’ he drew my attention to the dun snout that came floating\r\ndown upon the bait—‘_Joaquin make it ferry!_’\r\n\r\n“I gave him one look, and he answered me with a grimace that would have\r\ndone credit to an idol. Then I sat down and laughed and laughed till I\r\nwas sore. The originality of it! The old scoundrel was positively and\r\nactually maintaining his private alligator to put the fear of death\r\nupon the niggers and mulattos that used the short cut into the town,\r\nand was reaping a harvest of ferry dues over a four-foot deep river!\r\n\r\n“He watched me, as I shouted, quite politely, and when I’d had my laugh\r\nout insisted on escorting me into his house and offering me a glass of\r\naguardiente. While I was sipping it he was rummaging among his litter\r\nand finally produced me a line in the place of the one that Joaquin had\r\nsnatched. He insisted on binding it on to my reel, and then, in his\r\nbroken English, began to explain just where the best fishing stands\r\ncould be found along the banks. And he didn’t stop a-telling. He took\r\nme out when the sun got lower and gave me a few practical hints upon the\r\nspot. He laid himself out to be agreeable, and at the end of a couple\r\nof hours we were as thick as thieves.\r\n\r\n“When we got back to the shanty we found a thick, squat, low-browed\r\nyoung man smoking a cigarette on the veranda. The old man introduced\r\nhim as his son, Concepcion. The youth bowed, smirked and expressed his\r\nsense of the honor in perfect English, yet somehow I didn’t take to him\r\nas I had done to his parent. He had the same magpie way of looking at\r\nyou as his father had, but with a difference. The old man did it with\r\na laugh in his eye: the young one furtively, shiftily and without the\r\nghost of a smile.\r\n\r\n“It came about that for the next twelve months I was thrown a good deal\r\ninto the company of the Garsias. They lived openly on the earnings\r\nof their ferry, but I suspected that they made a little by selling\r\naguardiente to my dagos and niggers. But they knew when to stop—they\r\nnever sent one of my crowd back so’s he couldn’t take his spell the day\r\nafter a carouse, and anything short of that I winked at.\r\n\r\n“Old man Blique was not a conversationalist, and the two at the\r\nbungalow were practically my only company for days together. And when\r\nthey were out of the way I got into the habit of regarding even Joaquin\r\nas a sort of companion. I got to know his haunts, and where a newcomer\r\nwould have seen nothing but an ugly log, half buried in the mud, I\r\ncould recognize the upper half of the alligator’s countenance and his\r\nlittle, straight, slit eyes winking at me most benevolent.\r\n\r\n“And yet he was the one that put an end to all this simplicity and\r\nloving kindness. I don’t know if the fish supply in the river grew\r\nshort. Perhaps in his old age he developed epicurean tastes. But nasty\r\nstories suddenly began to come in. Fowls went, pigs were missed and\r\nnever heard of again, a couple of steers disappeared from an _estancia_\r\nhigher up the river, and a mare of Emil’s was robbed of her colt and\r\npervaded the banks of the bayou for weeks, neighing like a lost soul.\r\nJoaquin grew to be the most unpopular personage in the neighborhood.\r\n\r\n“The worst, however, was to come. Red Rambo, the head man of a gang\r\nthat worked Number 44 level, and a mulatto went spreeing off to\r\nSantiago one fine evening before a Saint’s Day. The next afternoon,\r\nlate, as I was fishing, he appeared on the opposite bank, evidently\r\nfull up, calling to Pedro to fetch him and his mates across. The moment\r\nthe old man had got the pirogue against the far bank Red Rambo started\r\nto call him every kind of extortioner and money-sucker, and, seeing\r\nthat it was from a mulatto to a pure-breed creole, I don’t wonder that\r\nthe old man got mad. He refused to take the fellow over—told him to\r\ncool his blood by walking six miles round.\r\n\r\n“Unfortunately Rambo had drunk himself up to the pitch of Dutch\r\nobstinacy and Dutch courage. He came splashing into the river, wading\r\nafter the pirogue and cursing Pedro by every saint in the nigger\r\ncalendar.\r\n\r\n“Some of the low-down half-castes, who’d believe anything, used to\r\ndeclare that Joaquin was the familiar spirit of the Garsia family and\r\nwas sworn to protect them in this life in return for a note of hand\r\nfor their souls in the life to come. I could see some of the men in\r\nthe boat just shivering for Red Rambo as they listened to the insults\r\nhe was piling upon the old boy, and their shivers were prophetic. For\r\nthere came a sudden swirl upon the surface of the calm in midstream,\r\nand then a little grooving eddy shot toward the mulatto with the rush\r\nof a millrace.\r\n\r\n“He yelled, tossed up his arms, and made a half-turn toward the shore.\r\nThrough a long instant I could see his finger-tips quiver against the\r\ngreen of a fern palm opposite. And then he was _gone_—snatched down\r\nfrom below as suddenly as the pantomime clown drops through the trap\r\nin the boards. A little foaming cone of water burst up from the whirl\r\nwhere he disappeared, and long, irregular stains floated away from its\r\ncrimson centre. But never another sign of Rambo was seen again, either\r\nin the water or out of it. Joaquin was both his murderer and his grave!\r\n\r\n“In justice to poor old Pedro I must allow that he was the man who\r\ntook the thing most to heart. He screeched, he gesticulated, he called\r\ndown curses upon the alligator from all the angels of paradise, and\r\nhe made as if he would leap into the river and fall upon Joaquin with\r\nnothing more than a pocket-knife; in fact, it took all the exertions\r\nof the other niggers to keep him from it. They got him ashore at last\r\npretty well demented and fighting like a maniac. He had to be tied to\r\nhis bed before we durst leave him to himself. When the others had gone\r\njabbering off home I shook my head solemnly at Concepcion.\r\n\r\n“‘That means the end of Joaquin,’ I said. ‘Tomorrow I shall get orders\r\nfrom the boss to fill him up with Winchester bullets, and then where’s\r\nyour ferry?’\r\n\r\n“The Spaniard was as pale as milk. He looked away from me to his father\r\nfoaming upon the bed, and then he gave a queer little high-pitched\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\n“‘Señor Banks,’ he answered, ‘there may be two sides to that question.\r\nSeñor Blique owns the mines, but not the river or the alligator. That\r\ndirt-begotten negro brought his fate upon himself.’\r\n\r\n“I looked at him narrowly, and noticed that he was ostentatiously and\r\nabnormally calm. That’s a bad sign in a creole. They are safer red and\r\nroaring. Cold and white they’re malicious.\r\n\r\n“‘My dear friend,’ said I politely, ‘there is no law against alligator\r\nshooting. Whatever orders I get I shall obey—be sure of that and take\r\na friendly warning. Joaquin can’t stay hereabouts after that bloody\r\nexploit—it’s absurd to expect it.’\r\n\r\n“He bowed quite pleasantly.\r\n\r\n“‘If warnings are in order, señor,’ he replied, ‘take one from me.\r\nThe man that kills Joaquin will not live long to boast of it!’ And at\r\nthat he drew back the curtain from before the door and gave me a very\r\nsignificant view of the street. I took the hint and, without another\r\nword, marched out. And I did it sideways, too. You don’t expose the\r\nbroad of your back to a man of Concepcion’s singular talents without\r\nmaking sure that he’s leaving his knife in his belt.\r\n\r\n“Of course, as I predicted, old Emil was not prepared to stand any\r\nnonsense from Pedro Garsia, his son, or Joaquin. Rambo was one of his\r\nbest foremen. He gave me the strictest orders to take my gun to the\r\nalligator the first thing in the morning and to revenge the mulatto if\r\nit took all day. I nodded, shrugged my shoulders, and went to bed.\r\n\r\n“The first news brought me in the morning was that old Pedro was\r\ndead. The shock had brought on brain fever, and the son’s homeopathic\r\ntreatment of forcing aguardiente down his throat had lifted the fever\r\nto the point of delirium. In the night the patient had burst his bonds\r\nand broken straight for the river. His son and their nigger servant had\r\nbeen aroused by the noise and had followed.\r\n\r\n“They were just about ten seconds too late. The old man stumbled upon\r\nthe bank and went sprawling half in and half out of the water, his\r\noutstretched hand falling upon what the nigger thought was a floating\r\nlog.\r\n\r\n“It wasn’t. For the log split into twin jaws, and, as the other two\r\nsnatched the poor old fellow up, the open fangs came together just\r\nbelow the unfortunate wretch’s shoulder. It was only a piece of corpse\r\nthat they carried back into the veranda, while Joaquin went smiling off\r\ninto midstream to enjoy a most unexpected dessert.\r\n\r\n“I considered, of course, that any son with Christian feelings would\r\nspare me any further trouble in the matter of the alligator’s death.\r\nThat, for the sake of commercial advantage, Concepcion would allow\r\nhis parent to go unrevenged seemed out of the question. I took my\r\nWinchester with me as I strolled down to the river merely because I\r\nthought he might be too much overcome with grief to have completed his\r\nobvious duty, and that I might do him a neighborly turn by forestalling\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“You can imagine my surprise, then, when I saw, as I turned the corner\r\nof the Garsia bungalow, Concepcion, standing alone upon the river\r\nbank, the usual basket of offal on the ground beside him, tossing the\r\ncontents into the water, lump by lump! The alligator was taking them,\r\nserenely and regularly, waiting for them with half-open jaws as a\r\nlapdog waits for biscuits!\r\n\r\n“There are moments when one’s impulses take the reins into their teeth\r\nand bolt. I made no sound—I said nothing. I strode silently up behind\r\nthe man, drew a clear bead upon the brute’s eye and sent a bullet plumb\r\ninto his wicked brain. And as he ripped out of the water and rolled\r\nover in his agony I fired another cartridge at the junction of his\r\nforearm and body, and that was the end of his floundering. He sank like\r\na lump of lead.\r\n\r\n“The Spaniard gave a yell as I fired the first time. I brought my rifle\r\ndown from the second shot to see him springing straight at me. I pulled\r\nhim up short. With the butt at my hip and the muzzle pointing straight\r\nat his chest, I made him understand just what to expect if he came a\r\nstep nearer. He halted five yards away—panting.\r\n\r\n“For ten seconds we two stood there, each glaring into the other’s\r\nface, and if the light of hell ever burns in a man’s eyes, I saw it so\r\nburning in the eyes of Concepcion Garsia. His shirt was open at the\r\nneck—I could watch the drumming of his heart within his ribs!\r\n\r\n“And then the tenseness of his limbs gave. He seemed to fall in\r\nupon himself. He just gasped one threatening word—‘_Mañana!_’\r\n(tomorrow!)—turned upon his heel and staggered off toward his house\r\nlike a drunken man! I did not see him again for a fortnight.\r\n\r\n“Of course, after that, the fact that there was a strain of madness in\r\nthe Garsia family didn’t seem to me open to doubt. And, pondering the\r\nquestion, I determined that I must be very much upon my guard whenever\r\nI visited the ferry. My fishing excursions I gave up entirely and I\r\nwore my six-shooter night and day. No—with Concepcion I was taking no\r\nrisks.\r\n\r\n“That same evening Joaquin’s carcass floated up upon a sandbank a\r\nhundred yards below the bungalow. The next morning it was gone. The\r\nbush behind the bank was trampled and bloodstained, and the niggers\r\nbegan to whisper. They told me, in confidence, that the Spaniard had\r\ndug his heart out to make a fetich of and that I was doomed to many\r\nlingering torments. Naturally, I took small notice of that sort of\r\nthing.\r\n\r\n“The hands, now that the ferry had become a ford again, went much\r\nmore frequently down to Santiago, and it was not long before I heard\r\nthat Concepcion had been seen there. But his bungalow was closed, his\r\nnigger had been sent about his business, and the weeds began to fill\r\nhis garden, as weeds do in tropical countries alone. At the end of a\r\ncouple of weeks I began to believe that we had seen the last of Señor\r\nConcepcion.\r\n\r\n“And then a thing happened that appeared to be no less than a miracle.\r\nOne evening, less than half an hour after a score of the hands had set\r\nout to spend the next day’s fiesta in the town, nineteen of them were\r\nback in my veranda, yelling, screeching that Joaquin was returned—back\r\nand playing his old tricks again! He had risen in the midst of them as\r\nthey forded the stream and had taken down Tome, a quadroon pickman,\r\nexactly as he had taken down Red Rambo less than a month before.\r\n\r\n“Of course, I didn’t believe them. I had seen my bullets go home into\r\nJoaquin’s brain and heart and I opined that Tome, for the joke of the\r\nthing, had dived with a bit of a splutter and was probably laughing\r\nhimself into convulsions at the success of the trick. I put this view\r\nof the case to the others mildly.\r\n\r\n“They didn’t seem to have breath enough to pour all the contempt they\r\nfelt upon the idea. ‘Dived! Joking!’ He was pulled down, screaming,\r\nthey declared—they saw the jaws close on him—there wasn’t one of them\r\nfive yards from him when he was taken!\r\n\r\n“I shrugged my shoulders, took my rifle and went back with them to the\r\nriver bank. You can just figure my astonishment when a dun snout, as\r\nlike the late Joaquin’s as one pea is like another, cut a lazy ripple\r\nacross the surface as it went sliding out from the bank into midstream!\r\nAnd the boil of his tail showed up ten yards behind his head. I hadn’t\r\nbelieved that there was another such alligator in the wide world!\r\n\r\n“These reflections didn’t prevent my rifle-butt coming up to my\r\nshoulder. I aimed for a point three inches behind the snout. We heard\r\nthe bullet thud, but the brute didn’t twitch—he didn’t even close his\r\nhalf-open eye! He just let the water close slowly over his head—so\r\nslowly that I found time to empty my magazine at him as he sank. Every\r\none of the five bullets hit his wicked head, and the last glanced\r\noff! We knew it by the sound of a second thud among the echoes of the\r\nreport, while a splash of splintered wood showed on a branch on the\r\nopposite side of the stream. Positively and actually, this new Joaquin\r\nhad a shot-proof skull!\r\n\r\n“The niggers were gabbling excitedly about Ju-ju, and such like\r\nidolatries, while the dagos were little better. As for me, I sat down\r\nupon a stump and took my head in my hands. That two brutes of the same\r\nsize should appear in the same unimportant little Cuban creek was\r\nalmost unbelievable—to the superstitious imaginations of the mine\r\nhands it could be explained in one way alone. It was debbil-debbil, and\r\nthey went off home up the hill, starting out of their skins if a bird\r\nrustled in the bushes. I was left sitting and wondering.\r\n\r\n“At the sound of an opening door some time later I looked up.\r\nConcepcion Garsia came sauntering out of the bungalow. I reached for my\r\nWinchester.\r\n\r\n“He strolled on toward me slowly and complacently, halted a few yards\r\naway and bowed. There was a wicked sneer round his thin lips.\r\n\r\n“‘_Buenos dias, señor_,’ (Good day) he said as he raised his hat. ‘As\r\nyou remarked, it is permitted to shoot alligators. That, it appears,\r\ndoes not always include the killing of them,’ and he laughed—his queer\r\nhigh-pitched laugh.\r\n\r\n“For the moment I was tongue-tied. The suggestion that an animal whose\r\nbrain had been shattered by my bullet was still alive was ridiculous,\r\nbut—well, the ‘but’ was to explain this new brute of the same size in\r\nprecisely the same spot. I looked Garsia squarely in the eyes.\r\n\r\n“‘Do you mean to imply that Joaquin has come back?’ I asked.\r\n\r\n“He shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n“‘_Quien sabe_—who knows?’ he answered, with that impudent smile still\r\ntwisting his lips. ‘What is your own opinion, señor?’\r\n\r\n“I patted the breech of my rifle.\r\n\r\n“‘It is here,’ I said quietly. ‘Joaquin—or another, I shall continue\r\nthe old treatment, _amigo_ (friend). Half an ounce of lead—at frequent\r\nintervals.’\r\n\r\n“He laughed again jeeringly, and turned upon his heel.\r\n\r\n“‘Continue it, señor, continue it,’ he cried over his shoulder, ‘but\r\nremember that all things come to an end, even your treatment and\r\nperhaps—yourself!’\r\n\r\n“The next minute he had slammed the door of his bungalow, and I, not\r\nforgetting what an excellent mark for a bullet I was against the yellow\r\nof the tinder-dry bush, hastened to put a tree between myself and the\r\nshuttered window.\r\n\r\n“There is no need to go into details of the next three months. It is\r\nsufficient to say that the alligator began a reign of terror at the\r\nford. Horses went—goats, steers, poultry. And the river was almost\r\ndeserted, for boats were no longer a protection. The planters, who had\r\nbeen accustomed to use the water for a highway between their\r\n_estancias_, gave it up after no less than five pirogues had been\r\ncharged by the monster, and upset. One of the crew always sank, never\r\nto rise again. Strangers using the foot road, and too impatient to wait\r\nfor the chance of being ferried when the boat was the wrong side, were\r\nsnatched up. Finally the heavy ferry pirogue itself was capsized, and\r\nManuel, the creole overseer, was lost. With him went, moreover, two\r\nthousand _pesetas_ in cash, which he was bringing up from the bank at\r\nSantiago for pay day.\r\n\r\n“No less than twenty poor wretches went to their account in one way\r\nor another in those twelve weeks, and the countryside grew desperate.\r\nEnough bullets were showered upon the alligator to sink him by pure\r\nweight if they had only stuck in him, but he seemed to mind them no\r\nmore than peas! I spent a week’s pay in cartridges myself.\r\n\r\n“Of course, it is all very well to sit here in this smoking-room and\r\nlaugh out of court ideas about Ju-ju, fetish work, Whydah and all\r\nthose sorts of deviltries. They don’t go with ten-thousand-ton boats,\r\nelectric light and the last special edition Marconigram. But it gets\r\non your nerves if you sit day after day beside a jungle-ringed swamp,\r\nlistening to all that a couple of hundred niggers have to tell you\r\nabout the tropical powers of the Evil One. And that there was something\r\nmysterious in the business I could swear—something, too, that my\r\ninstincts told me Concepcion Garsia held the key to. The sight of his\r\nface the few times I passed him witnessed to that. There was a glint\r\nof triumph in his eye that was simply diabolical. And yet he seldom\r\nshowed himself. Passers-by used the ferry pirogue as they liked—the\r\n_centimos_ that his father used to collect he seemed to think no more\r\nabout.\r\n\r\n“Well, as Concepcion himself remarked, there is an end to everything,\r\neven to this story, and it fell to my lot to write finis across it.\r\nBut it was Providence alone that kept me from being the page and the\r\nSpaniard the writer. It was just this way.\r\n\r\n“I sat, one evening, on the bank not far from the bungalow, reading.\r\nI was keeping an occasional lookout for the alligator, though as the\r\nseasonal floods were just falling he hadn’t been seen for two or three\r\nweeks. I had my revolver in my belt, more by habit than with any hope\r\nof doing him mortal harm with it. Experience had proved that the\r\nheaviest rifle bullets didn’t affect him. Just as I finished a chapter\r\na voice hailed me from across the stream.\r\n\r\n“I looked up, and recognized Señora Barenna, the wife of the planter\r\nat the _estancia_ behind Blique Mountain. She was waving her hand, and\r\nbeckoning to me to bring the pirogue across.\r\n\r\n“I was surprised to see her there, for neither she nor her husband\r\nused the ferry, as the metaled road to Santiago passed close to their\r\nhouse. But naturally I didn’t wait for explanations at that distance.\r\nI ran down, got into the boat and began to pull hand over hand on the\r\nguide-rope. The señora welcomed me with a smile.\r\n\r\n“‘You may well stare,’ she said, as I gave her my hand to help her down\r\nthe bank, ‘to find me in such a situation. I was driving from the town\r\nwhen our stupid mules took fright at a wild pig that ran between their\r\nfeet. They swerved, bolted into the bush, smashed a wheel and there I\r\nfound myself, less than three miles from home by the ford, and six by\r\nthe road! You may imagine which I chose.’\r\n\r\n“‘I’m truly sorry for your misfortune,’ said I, ‘but truly glad of the\r\nopportunity of doing you a service,’ for Spanish ladies expect this\r\nsort of thing and I began to collect my ideas for a further succession\r\nof compliments. I never had a chance to frame them, for the pirogue,\r\nwhich was in midstream again by now, quivered with a tremendous shock.\r\nIt was lifted half out of the water!\r\n\r\n“The next instant it began to rock from side to side, broke from the\r\nloop which held it to the guide-rope, and finally upset. The señora\r\nscreamed, and both she and I instinctively grasped the strands above\r\nour heads. The boat floated on its side from beneath our feet!\r\n\r\n“She was hanging by her hands alone. I swung up my feet, got a good\r\npurchase by crooking my knee, and so, freeing one arm, hauled her up by\r\nthe waist beside me.\r\n\r\n“Fortunately, she was an active woman, and she kept her presence of\r\nmind. I shouted to her to unfasten the shoulder-shawl she wore, and to\r\nfasten it over the rope and around her waist. She had done it in less\r\ntime than it takes to tell of it, but as she did it my heart jumped\r\ninto my mouth. Our combined weights amounted to more than the rope had\r\nbeen stayed up to bear. The poles to which it was lashed at each end\r\nslanted. We dipped till, owing to the height of the flood, we swung a\r\nbare six inches above the surface! And, of course, I had a very good\r\nidea of what had upset the boat!\r\n\r\n“I had not to wait long. There was a boil of the eddies not ten yards\r\naway and the familiar dun snout lifted and showed the upper half of\r\nan open jaw. The brute made a bee-line for the bait that hung so\r\nattractively at his mercy.\r\n\r\n“Señora Barenna’s shriek was piercing. As for me—well, I spoke before\r\nof the sudden way in which an impulse masters one. I saw in an instant\r\nthat it was a case of two or one, and a sort of frenzy of rage seized\r\nupon me. With a curse I flung myself down upon the brute’s head,\r\nfeeling with my thumbs for his eyes, while, released from my weight,\r\nthe rope jerked the señora up six feet into safety.\r\n\r\n“The next few seconds were a sort of disconnected nightmare. The water\r\nclosed over my head, the great jaws worked beneath my hands, and then a\r\nblow struck me on the chest, exactly over the book that I had placed in\r\nmy breast-pocket a minute or two before.\r\n\r\n“At times like those one’s reason is not in the very best working\r\norder, but even then I was quite capable of recognizing that the blow\r\ncould not have been dealt by an alligator’s clumsy limbs. And my legs\r\nand feet, too, instead of meeting the resistance of the brute’s back,\r\nwere sprawled along nothing more solid than a twenty-foot pole!\r\n\r\n“My hand gripped my revolver from my belt, searched with it aimlessly\r\ndownward and sideways, and blundered against what I felt to be a living\r\nbody. At the same time the blow was repeated, but not quite in the same\r\nplace. The point of an edged weapon slipped across the smooth cover of\r\nthe book and gashed into my ribs. At that I pulled the trigger!\r\n\r\n“And many a time since have I thanked Providence for the man that\r\ninvented brass-drawn, water-tight cartridges. For as I fired there was\r\na great bubbling rush from the explosion that rocked me over, while the\r\nhuge head below me heaved violently. Like a leaping salmon it burst\r\nwith me above the surface!\r\n\r\n“The flood caught us, gripped us, and whirled us away together, to\r\nfling us up upon a shallow bank of mud. And as I struggled to my feet I\r\nlooked down upon Concepcion’s dead body, a wound gaping in it from my\r\nbullet, while beside him was stranded a great sheet-iron shell, floated\r\nwith leathern bags and surmounted with the stuffed head of old Joaquin!\r\nBehind it stretched a pole ornamented with the tip of the same animal’s\r\ntail!\r\n\r\n“Well, gentlemen, I don’t know that there is much more to add. After\r\nI had climbed along the rope and dragged Señora Barenna into safety\r\nI kicked open the door of the bungalow and left her there, while I\r\nhurried up to the works for help. But before I sent old Emil and his\r\nhousekeeper down with cordials, and so forth, I got the old man’s\r\npermission to knock the hands off at once. I had my reasons.\r\n\r\n“I lined those superstitious fools along the mud-bank before that sham\r\nscaffolding of an alligator, and the sermon I preached them on the\r\nfollies of Ju-ju ought to have converted them then and there. But the\r\nresults were entirely contrary to my expectations. For when, some years\r\nlater, after I had left old Emil, I returned for a short visit to the\r\nBarennas, who were always my grateful friends, I found Joaquin’s head\r\nhung in their veranda.\r\n\r\n“A servant who did not know me saw me looking at it.\r\n\r\n“‘That American debbil-debbil,’ he explained politely, and pointed\r\nto the little brass plate his master had had stuck upon it with an\r\ninscription setting forth that I had shot the brute on such and such a\r\ndate. ‘Him name _Banks_,’ he added, ‘and great big Ju-ju. Nigger boy\r\nsay prayers to him ebry night!’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _The Boy; His Hand and Pen_\r\n\r\n\r\n                           BY TOM P. MORGAN\r\n\r\nMy Aunt Almira, who is an old maid, says that spring is the time when\r\nthe young man’s fancy lightly turns to thoughts of love; but my Uncle\r\nBill, who has been a bachelor so long that it’s chronic with him,\r\nsays that ’most every spring he gets as bilious as a goat. That’s the\r\nway it goes; women are romantic and are everlastingly thinking about\r\ntheir hearts and souls, while men are generally more concerned about\r\ntheir stomachs and pocketbooks. You give a man enough to eat and a few\r\ndollars to squander and he’ll manage to scuffle along, but a woman\r\nwon’t be happy unless she’s worrying about love, or something.\r\n\r\nUncle Bill once knew an old maid who lived in constant dread of finding\r\na man under the bed. She kept on hopefully fearing him for thirty-seven\r\nyears, and early in the thirty-eighth she was drowned. One time there\r\nwas a Brighamyoungamist who married twenty-three different women in\r\nrapid succession, and he looked a good deal like the last end of a\r\nhard winter, too. Well, the judge threw up his hands in astonishment,\r\nand asked him how in all-git-out a man would go to work to marry\r\ntwenty-three women. And the Brighamyoungamist grinned and replied:\r\n\r\n“Aw—tee! hee!—Judge, I just asked ’em!”\r\n\r\nBut, on the other hand, spring is the time when your neighbor\r\nborrows your lawn-mower and keeps it till he is ready to borrow your\r\nsnow-shovel. In the spring all Nature seems to smile, especially in\r\nthe Third Reader, and the little flowers go gaily skipping over hill\r\nand dale. The grass pops up, the boys begin fighting regularly, the\r\nbirds warble all the day long in the leafy boughs, and the book-agent\r\ncomes hurriedly up the road with a zealous but firm dog appended to his\r\npants. About this time you feel achy and itchy and stretchy and gappy,\r\nand so forth, all of which is a sign that you’ve got the spring fever.\r\nSome men have the spring fever all the year round. Then they join all\r\nthe lodges they can squeeze into, and owe everybody, and talk about the\r\nworkingman needing his beer on Sunday.\r\n\r\nThis is all I know about spring, and most of it is what Uncle Bill told\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Old Saws Filed New_\r\n\r\n\r\n“Vice is contagious”—and so few of us have been vaccinated!\r\n\r\n“A man must keep his mouth open a long time before a roast pigeon flies\r\ninto it”—but the chances are worse if he keeps it shut.\r\n\r\n“Associate with men of good judgment”—if their good judgment will\r\npermit.\r\n\r\n“Duty is a power which rises with us in the morning and goes to rest\r\nwith us in the evening”—or even earlier in the day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _The Force of Circumstance_\r\n\r\n\r\n                       BY CHAUNCEY C. HOTCHKISS\r\n\r\nThey came up to me, he and his daughter, as I was sitting on the\r\nhalf-deserted piazza of the hotel. His soft felt hat had been replaced\r\nby a tall one, and there was no suggestion of his former outing costume\r\nin the stiff linen and conventionally cut clothing he wore. His\r\ndaughter stood by his side, her hand within his arm, a little impatient\r\npout on her lips and a petulant wrinkle on her fine brows, as fair a\r\nspecimen of the typical American girl, in beauty of face and form and\r\ntaste in dress, as one could find or wish for.\r\n\r\n“Ah, Alan, my boy!” said he heartily. “I’m off—quite suddenly. Some\r\nplaguy business in town, you know. Sorry, but can’t help it! Wish you\r\nwere going along! Will be back tomorrow night—I think.” And here he\r\ngave me a decided wink with the eye farthest from his daughter. The\r\ngirl twisted him about to see his face, as though suspicious of his\r\nhonesty.\r\n\r\n“Why must you go, papa? And why won’t you take me? Aunt Margaret and\r\nher rheumatism are poor company!”\r\n\r\n“No, no, little woman—not this time! Force of circumstances, you know.\r\nMustn’t leave your aunt alone—not for the world! Have many things to\r\nsee to in town. How’s your arm, Alan? Better? That’s good! There’s the\r\nstage, by Jove! Keep her out of mischief, my boy. Kiss your dad, puss.\r\nGood-bye, Alan!”\r\n\r\nAs I looked at this fine specimen of metropolitan growth while he\r\nclambered into the ramshackle stage that ran to the station, I felt\r\npretty sure that his conscience was not quite easy in thus hurrying to\r\ntown and leaving his daughter to her own devices. That the easy-going,\r\nretired lawyer, whose hardest work consisted in killing time, had no\r\nsuch pressing matters on hand as he had intimated, I was certain, and\r\nhad small doubt that visions of the stock-ticker, cool cocktails and\r\nclub cronies were the “plaguy business” which demanded his attention.\r\nNor did I blame him, for had it not been for the young girl who was now\r\nlooking blankly at the rapidly retreating vehicle my own place at the\r\ntable of the hotel would have been vacated days before.\r\n\r\nA broken arm just cut of its sling and still almost useless was\r\nmy ostensible reason for lingering. It served me as an excuse\r\nfor protracting the pleasures of the broad Sound and stunted but\r\npicturesque woods, though it did not blind me to the fact that I was\r\nplaying with fire by remaining. I was not born with a great deal\r\nof conceit and am too well acquainted with the times to have faith\r\nin the infallibility of love as a leveling power when applied to\r\ncash considerations. In finances the girl was an aristocrat and I a\r\nplebeian. My meditations were to myself, but the young lady gave vent\r\nto hers.\r\n\r\n“Very good, sir! I’ll pay you well for this,” she said, shaking her\r\nfinger in the direction of the vanished stage. “You wouldn’t take me\r\nwith you! Well, you’ll wish you had!” Then she turned to me. “Why did\r\nhe go, Mr. Alan?”\r\n\r\n“I’m sure I don’t know. Force of circumstances, he said.”\r\n\r\n“Force of fiddlesticks! He _always_ gives that as an excuse when he\r\ndoes anything I dislike. I don’t believe in the force of circumstances.\r\nDo you?”\r\n\r\n“Most assuredly,” I returned.\r\n\r\n“Well, I don’t, then. I’m a free agent. You and papa might as well\r\nconfess to fatalism. I would like to see circumstances force me!”\r\n\r\n“I might weave a story showing the contrary. You have just seen——”\r\n\r\n“Oh, that and your story would prove nothing,” she interrupted, with a\r\ncharming lack of logic. “A truce to nonsense—it’s too hot. Look at me,\r\nsir!” she commanded, with mock severity. “Papa has practically thrown\r\nme on your hands without regard to my opinion in the matter, as though\r\nI were a small child. Aunt Margaret has a mild spell of rheumatism and\r\nthe religious mood that always seems to go with it. I understand that\r\nyou are responsible for me; how dare you assume the burden?”\r\n\r\n“I accept, however,” I replied, with secret warmth.\r\n\r\n“You will probably live to repent it. What shall we do?”\r\n\r\n“Anything you elect. I am under your orders.”\r\n\r\n“Then see that you obey them. The woods are too wet for a walk since\r\nlast night’s storm, and as for staying about here after being cooped up\r\ntwo whole days by rain, it is intolerable. Let’s try to get Maxwell to\r\ntake us out on his fishing-sloop. He will do it for you.”\r\n\r\n“No,” I said firmly. “That is the one thing your father prohibits.\r\nIt is mere nervousness, of course, but I will not be a party to such\r\na thing. Think of something else—the force of circumstance is still\r\nagainst you.”\r\n\r\n“Plague take the force of circumstance!” she exclaimed, but did not\r\nurge me further, though my suspicions should have been aroused when she\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“We will take lunch and go to the beach anyway. Shall we?”\r\n\r\n“Well, you might do that without breaking the fifth commandment,”\r\nI returned, with much less enthusiasm than I felt at the idea of a\r\ntête-à-tête picnic with her.\r\n\r\nHer answer was a light laugh. There was a swishing of skirts and a\r\ntwinkle of tan-colored shoes as she sped from the piazza to get ready,\r\nleaving me with the certainty that I was a fool, or worse, for allowing\r\nher to go unchaperoned, though I was too selfish to attempt to right\r\nthe neglect.\r\n\r\nSomething over an hour later a scraggy horse hitched to a scraggy wagon\r\nwas drawing us to the “Cove,” a mile or so distant from the hotel. A\r\nwell-packed hamper had been provided and the pace set for the day was\r\nnothing less innocent than lunch on the beach, which at this quarter\r\nof Long Island is a stretch of snow-white sand and the perfection of\r\nisolation.\r\n\r\nIt was not with feelings of positive delight that, as we neared the\r\nSound, I noticed the _Flying Fish_, of which Maxwell was master, moored\r\nat the edge of the expanse of blue water. From an artistic point it\r\nmight have satisfied me, as fine material for an _aquarelle_ as, with\r\nits mainsail loosely hoisted for drying, it lay against the strip of\r\nwoods on the other side of the little bay, but it did not satisfy me\r\nto have a controversy on the point of taking my companion for a sail,\r\na thing to which I knew her father to be strongly opposed. However, it\r\nwas not a lengthy skirmish.\r\n\r\n“Will you ask Maxwell to take us out—for just an hour?” she asked\r\ndemurely.\r\n\r\n“Not for one instant,” I replied. “Besides, there is no wind.”\r\n\r\n“There will be wind enough; you are just determined to be meanly\r\nperverse. _I_ will ask him!” And she sent her clear voice across the\r\nwater in a long-drawn call.\r\n\r\nI saw the man on board look up from the work he was fussing over;\r\npresently the sail was lowered and, shortly after, the punt drove its\r\nnose into the sand of the beach and Maxwell came toward us.\r\n\r\n“Miss Edith,” I said, with dignity and as much severity as I dared show\r\nher, “I am well aware that I have no right to dictate to you, but if\r\nyou are determined to go sailing in spite of your father’s wishes you\r\nwill go without me.”\r\n\r\n“Do you really mean it?” she asked, with a light laugh and a wicked\r\nglint in her eyes. “What a goose you are! Of course I wouldn’t go, but\r\nwe can compromise. Let’s go out to her and lunch on board. It will be\r\never so much nicer than the sand, and I have never even stepped on\r\nboard of a sloop. Can’t we go out to her, Mr. Maxwell?”\r\n\r\n“Sartin, miss, but it’s lucky that’s all ye want,” said that worthy.\r\nThen, turning to me, he continued:\r\n\r\n“The old tub’s ’most used up, Mr. Alan. She broke up a good deal of\r\nher riggin’ in the storm last night. That ain’t all, neither. I find\r\nthe anchor shackle most rusted out and the moorin’ line ’most chafed\r\nthrough. I was just startin’ for a new shackle. Tell you what ye might\r\ndo, sir, an’ ’twould be a big favor. Let me put you two aboard and then\r\ntake your hoss to go to the Centre with. That will suit the lady an’ be\r\na savin’ to my legs. I will be back in a shake.”\r\n\r\n“Where’s your deck-hand?” I asked, wavering in my determination.\r\n\r\n“Gone home sick, sir. Last night used him up.”\r\n\r\nDoubts of propriety and prudence were of little avail against the\r\ncoaxing demands of my companion. She was used to having her way in\r\nmost things. Nothing but the novelty of taking lunch on board the old\r\nfishing-boat would satisfy her, and, as it would not do for me to carry\r\nthe air of protector too far, it was but a short time before we were\r\non the deck of the vessel, from which we watched Maxwell climb into\r\nthe wagon and start for the village. The lady’s expression was one of\r\nsubdued triumph.\r\n\r\nI confess that as I saw the little boat pulled high on the beach and\r\nrealized how completely we were cut off from the land, I was conscious\r\nof a feeling that was not one of unalloyed content. From the physical\r\nconditions there seemed to be nothing to fear. The water of the Cove\r\nwas like glass in the hot sunshine, and the vessel as steady as the\r\nRock of Ages; but the situation would certainly become compromising to\r\nthe fair young girl if our isolation should be generally known, and,\r\nthough I was willing enough to shoot at folly as it flew, I was in\r\nhopes that the absence of Maxwell would not be prolonged, and so set to\r\nwork to entertain and enlighten Miss Edith, who was a very child in her\r\ncuriosity and her demands to have it satisfied.\r\n\r\nThe _Flying Fish_, a fearful misnomer, was an old acquaintance of\r\nmine, and was typical of her class. Clean enough on deck, she was an\r\nabomination of vile smells below, the combination of fish, clams and\r\nbilge-water making a forcible compound. The inevitable scuttle-butt\r\nof fresh water stood before the mast, and forward was a mass of rusty\r\nchain cable, tangled gear, mops, winch-handles, buckets and the anchor,\r\nthe latter secured with a piece of rope.\r\n\r\nIn the stern of the boat the conditions were improved. The long tiller\r\nprojected into the roomy cockpit, the seats of which were as clean as\r\nwater could make them, while overhead the broken boom with its loose\r\nsail made a wide strip of shade that was very acceptable.\r\n\r\nFor me there was no novelty in the craft, but it was a monstrous toy\r\nfor my companion, who flitted from stem to stern, picking up her dainty\r\nskirts as she explored the bow, or wrinkling her delicate nose as she\r\nmet the odor of the cabin she insisted on entering.\r\n\r\n“Does Maxwell cook on that thing?” asked the girl, pointing to the\r\nsmall stove red with old rust, “and sleep in one of those dirty boxes?”\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly. That is a sailor’s lot.”\r\n\r\n“Horrors! I wouldn’t be a sailor for the world! Let’s get into the\r\nair—I’m stifled!”\r\n\r\nAn hour passed quickly enough and without the return of Maxwell. The\r\nlunch was spread and eaten in the strip of shade, which took another\r\nhour. A slight restraint followed the smoking of my cigar, for our\r\nconversation was becoming as circumscribed as our freedom, probably due\r\nto the fact that we both began to realize we were prisoners. At best\r\nthere is no exhilaration of spirits to be found on the hot deck of a\r\ndilapidated fishing-sloop at anchor, and I dreaded the dulness which\r\nwould ensue if our confinement became protracted beyond a certain point.\r\n\r\nBut we were not destined to be beset by stupidity through lack\r\nof events. Two hours, three hours passed and yet no Maxwell. The\r\nconversation waned like a slowly dying blaze. I was becoming desperate\r\nand Miss Edith was beginning to question me with her eyes, when I saw\r\nmatters were to be made worse by a thunderstorm which showed its black\r\nhead over the woods to the southwest. Was Maxwell crazy? What could\r\nhe be thinking of to leave us in this predicament? Again and again I\r\nsearched the opening into the woods through which the horse and wagon\r\nhad disappeared, but the shore remained as wild and deserted as when\r\nColumbus discovered America. The little boat lay temptingly on the sand\r\nfive hundred feet away, but it might as well have been as many miles,\r\nfor my broken arm made swimming impossible.\r\n\r\nFrom being slightly compromising our situation had become fully so—and\r\nmore; it was irksome, awkward and not at all heroic. It was evident\r\nfrom her manner that the girl was becoming fully alive to her position.\r\n\r\nRapidly the clouds approached the zenith. They were terribly sinister,\r\nand, though there appeared to be no more danger to us than the remote\r\nchance of being struck by lightning, I dreaded for Miss Edith the\r\ncloser imprisonment in the unwholesome cabin and a probable drenching\r\nin the end.\r\n\r\nEven should Maxwell now arrive it would be impossible to return to the\r\nhotel before the storm broke, and as the sun became suddenly quenched\r\nby the sulphur-colored mass that had risen to it, and a sickly green\r\nshade settled over us, I turned my attention to cheering my companion,\r\nwho, awed by the tragic light that overspread us, seemed lost in\r\nfearful contemplation of the approaching tempest, and sat silent in the\r\ncockpit with both hands tightly clutching the tiller. The tide was full\r\nflood and not a wrinkle marred the polished surface of the Sound. In\r\nthe distance were some motionless vessels taking in their lighter sails\r\nand over all nature there brooded a portentous quiet.\r\n\r\nIt was evident that we were about to experience something out of\r\nthe common, for though the edge of the squall had no more than the\r\nusual threat of a summer shower, the clouds behind it sent through\r\nme a thrill of awe mingled with fear. As I stood with my hands on\r\nthe shrouds watching a space of inky blackness it opened and from it\r\ndescended a bulb of vapor shaped like a bowl, its edges hidden in the\r\nclouds above. It was a mass lighter than the rest, and it elongated\r\nuntil its form changed to a funnel-shaped pipe which gradually neared\r\nthe surface of the earth, trailing as it moved along. Its approach was\r\naccompanied with a roar as of a distant cataract, and as I saw the\r\nsinuous tube lose itself in a mist of dust, flying branches and heavier\r\ndebris and appear to be coming toward us, a fearful knowledge of what\r\nwe were about to encounter burst upon my mind and I turned quickly to\r\nthe girl, who in her fright had risen to her feet.\r\n\r\n“What is it?” she cried, blanching at the sight of the awful column.\r\n\r\n“A tornado! Into the cabin, quick!” I shouted.\r\n\r\nShe obeyed without a word, and I had barely time to snatch up the\r\nbasket containing the remains of our lunch and scramble through the\r\ndoor after her when, with a howl it is impossible to describe, the\r\nvortex of whirling air was upon us.\r\n\r\nThe darkness that came down like a curtain was appalling; the din\r\ndeafening. The centre of the tornado must have missed us, else I\r\nwould not now be telling this tale, but the sight through the open\r\ndoors, which I had not had time to close, showed it had missed us but\r\nnarrowly. I saw the surface of the Cove turn to milk under the lash\r\nof the wind, but had scant time to see more, for, as we were lying\r\nbroadside to the blast, it struck us fairly on the side and careened us\r\nuntil the deck stood wellnigh up and down.\r\n\r\nWith a shriek the girl threw herself into my arms, and we both slid\r\nto leeward. There came a jar as though we had been struck, a crash\r\noverhead that sent the skylight shivering in fragments about us, a\r\nquick blast of icy air, and the vessel righted with a jerk.\r\n\r\nPlacing the fainting girl on a locker I ran up the steps to the deck.\r\nThe whirlwind was passing out into the Sound, its shape hidden by the\r\nmuck that flew in its wake, though a well-defined path of fallen trees\r\nand boiling water marked its track. A moment’s observation showed its\r\noutskirts had created havoc aboard the sloop.\r\n\r\nThe mainsail, having been only held in stops, had been blown open by\r\nthe fearful power of the wind and, split into ribbons, was whipping in\r\nthe gale with quick, pistol-like reports. The boom-jack had been torn\r\naway and the broken spar fallen on the cabin-house, which accounted\r\nfor the smashed skylight. The topsail had clean gone, hardly a rag\r\nremaining. The buckets and all loose articles had been blown overboard;\r\nthe scuttle-butt had fetched away and lay bung down, its contents\r\ngurgling out through the vent, while the only things outside the hull\r\nthat remained intact were the jib-sail and its gearing.\r\n\r\nI had hardly made the last observation when I discovered we were\r\nadrift! The first fierce tug of the wind had snapped our moorings,\r\nwhich Maxwell had spoken of as chafed, and, under the weight of the\r\ngale which was blowing, we were rapidly drawing into open water.\r\n\r\nI caught my breath for a moment, but was immediately relieved as I\r\nthought of the anchor. Throwing off my coat I tossed it into the cabin,\r\nand, opening my pocket-knife, ran forward; but before I could reach\r\nthe bow I was drenched by a sudden downpour of rain the volume and icy\r\ncoldness of which made me gasp. It took but a second to cut the\r\nlashings that held the anchor, but, as the iron plunged to the bottom\r\nfollowed by only some half-fathom of chain, I nearly fainted. The\r\nshackle lay at my feet with its pin gone. The anchor was lost—the\r\nmooring parted; we were adrift in a storm and on a crippled boat.\r\n\r\nFor a moment I was completely stunned at the realization and stood\r\nlooking over the side like a fool, as though expecting to see the mass\r\nof lost iron float to the surface; but the violent beating of the rain,\r\nnow mixed with hail, forced sense into me and compelled a hasty retreat\r\nto the cabin.\r\n\r\nSo far as danger to life was concerned there was none at present, and\r\nthe one menace of the future lay in being blown across the Sound and\r\ngoing to pieces on the rocky coast of Connecticut. I was something of a\r\nfair-weather yachtsman and knew the danger of a lee shore; but whether\r\nmy wit would be sufficient to offset the predicament we were in I was\r\nby no means sure. For a rescue I trusted more to being picked up by\r\nsome passing craft than to my own efforts. But what a situation for the\r\nlady!\r\n\r\nHow to enlighten her as to our double disaster was troubling me not a\r\nlittle as I entered the cabin, but I had barely cleared the steps when\r\nwe were beset by a volley of hail that thundered on the cabin-house and\r\nrivaled the uproar of the tornado itself. Great icy lumps larger than\r\nmarbles drove through the broken skylight and bounded through the open\r\ndoor. The hail was followed by another downpour of rain accompanied by\r\nvivid lightning and bellowing thunder. Between the flashes the darkness\r\nwas that of midnight.\r\n\r\nKnowing the terror of my companion I attempted to speak to her, but my\r\nvoice was lost in the turmoil. Striking a match I lighted the small\r\nlamp hanging against the bulkhead and found the girl had recovered from\r\nher faint and was sitting on the locker with her face buried in her\r\nhands. At that moment the sky lightened a trifle and the thunder rolled\r\nmore at a distance. Shaken as I was, I little wondered at the\r\nconvulsive shudders that swept over her slight frame; had I been alone\r\nI might have succumbed to panic. Presently she looked up at me; her\r\nface was like chalk, but I was thankful to see that she had not lost\r\ncontrol of herself.\r\n\r\n“Oh, wasn’t it awful!” she exclaimed, and was about to rise when she\r\ncaught sight of my streaming clothing. “Why did you go out? What have\r\nyou been doing? Have you seen Maxwell?”\r\n\r\n“Maxwell? No, but I have seen enough else,” I returned, determined to\r\nhide nothing.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean? What has happened?”\r\n\r\n“I mean that we have met with disaster. We are adrift.”\r\n\r\n“Adrift!” Her eyes widened with sudden terror.\r\n\r\n“We have been torn from our moorings,” I answered, with an attempt at\r\nease that I might not increase her panic. “But there is no present\r\ndanger.”\r\n\r\n“I—I do not understand,” she said weakly.\r\n\r\n“I have made a mistake, which makes it worse,” I continued desperately.\r\n“I have cut away the anchor but lost it—the shackle-pin was gone. We\r\nmust——”\r\n\r\n“But you _knew_ the shackle-pin—or something—was gone! I heard\r\nMaxwell tell you!” she interrupted, with a flash of temper in her eye\r\nthat took the place of fear.\r\n\r\n“I remembered when too late,” I returned meekly. “In the confusion\r\nit went from my mind. When I found we had broken from the mooring I\r\nnaturally turned to the anchor and cut it free. Will you—can you\r\nforgive me? I will make what reparation I may.”\r\n\r\nFor an answer she dropped limply on the locker, and, again burying her\r\nface in her hands, sobbed violently while I stood silent, not knowing\r\nhow to comfort her, though my brain was busy enough. Presently the\r\nparoxysm passed and she looked up with a changed expression; then,\r\nheedless of her dainty costume, she approached me and placed both hands\r\non my wringing sleeve.\r\n\r\n“Oh, it is for you to forgive me!” she said, the tears still in her\r\neyes. “It is all my fault! If I had only heeded you in the beginning!\r\nAnd I am such a cowardly girl; but I’ll try to be brave and not make it\r\nworse. What must we do?” And a divine smile brightened her woebegone\r\nface.\r\n\r\n“I will tell you all I fear,” I said, mightily relieved at her changed\r\nattitude. “With the wind from its present quarter it is impossible to\r\nreturn to the Cove, and to continue drifting is dangerous. Stratford\r\nShoal lies directly in our way, and unless some other direction can be\r\ngiven the vessel we are certain to be wrecked upon it. Listen quietly,”\r\nI added, as I saw fright come again to her eyes. “I think I can avert\r\nthat danger. It may appear strange and hard to you, but it is necessary\r\nthat we run _from_ home instead of toward it. Will you trust me\r\nentirely?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes! I must—I will.”\r\n\r\n“Then excuse me for a time; I have work to do.”\r\n\r\n“And am I to sit still and do nothing?”\r\n\r\n“You may make a fire, if you will; we will need it. This may be an\r\nall-night matter.”\r\n\r\nShe shrank visibly, but made no reply, and, not daring to lose more\r\ntime, I abruptly left her.\r\n\r\nAll I had told her was true. The afternoon had waned and the storm\r\nwould cause the September day to darken early. The gale, yet strong\r\nfrom the southwest, was carrying us with considerable rapidity toward\r\nthe well-known shoal that lies in the centre of the Sound—a line of\r\nblack teeth marked by a lighthouse, and a deadly thing to have close\r\nto leeward. There was but one action for me to take, and that to set\r\nthe jib and under this single sail run to the eastward until we had the\r\nfortune to be picked up by some passing craft.\r\n\r\nBy this we had drawn so far into open water that the seas, which were\r\nrapidly rising, had a jump to them, making it a matter of some risk for\r\nme to crawl out on the foot-ropes of the bowsprit and throw off the\r\nropes that confined the jib; for it must be remembered that my left\r\narm was almost useless. It was an infinite labor for me to get the wet\r\ncanvas aloft, but I finally set the sail after a fashion. Loosening the\r\nsheet until the great spread of cotton blew out like a balloon, I took\r\nthe tiller and put the helm hard a-port.\r\n\r\nThere was life in the old tub at once. She had been wallowing heavily\r\nin the trough of the sea, but now we ran across the waves, and the\r\nchange of motion was a relief. The rain had ceased by this time, but\r\nthe sky was of an even blackness or the color of the smoke now pouring\r\nfrom the funnel of the cabin stove. As the gloom of evening fell the\r\nshore lights twinkled coldly across the water. No vessel came near\r\nenough to be hailed, and, as there is nothing distinctively distressing\r\nin the appearance of a fishing-smack running before the wind under her\r\njib, I saw it would be foolish to expect a rescue before daylight, save\r\nby the merest chance of being passed close at hand.\r\n\r\nThe gale was decreasing rapidly, but it was getting cold—bitter cold\r\nto me in my wet state. Not daring to leave the helm I called to Miss\r\nEdith to hand up my coat, but she appeared on deck with it. Her face\r\nwas hot and flushed, her head bare, and the wind caught her disordered\r\nhair and blew it about her eyes.\r\n\r\n“Why, you poor fellow!” she exclaimed as the cold air struck her. “You\r\nmust not do this! Let me take your place while you go down and get warm\r\nand dry.”\r\n\r\n“You are a ministering angel,” I returned through my chattering teeth,\r\n“but unfortunately you can’t steer. However, if you will watch here\r\nI will go down and wring myself out. I can lash the tiller. Do you\r\nrealize our situation?”\r\n\r\n“I—I believe so,” she faltered. “I did not even tell Aunt Margaret we\r\nwere going anywhere. It is too awful to think of—I dare not think—I\r\ntry not to. This is——”\r\n\r\n“The force of circumstance,” I interrupted, with an attempt at levity\r\nas I proceeded to fasten the helm. “A force you denied only a few hours\r\nago.”\r\n\r\n“And do now!” she said, with some spirit, catching back her blowing\r\nhair with her hand. “It was the desire to make you do something against\r\nyour will. It was pure foolishness. Don’t argue now. Do something for\r\nyourself; you will find that I have been neither idle nor useless.”\r\n\r\nI was surprised at the change she had wrought in the cabin. On a\r\nlocker was spread the remains of our lunch; the bunks had been put in\r\nsome kind of order, the floor wiped up, and the indefinable air of\r\nfemininity she had given to the dingy hole was accentuated by the gay\r\ncolor of her little hat, which hung against the blackened bulkhead.\r\nRank as it was, the warm atmosphere was a welcome change from that\r\nof the deck, and through it floated the odor of coffee. A pot was\r\nsimmering on the stove, the grate of which was all aglow.\r\n\r\nWhile wondering how she had brought herself to forage through the\r\nrepulsive mess below and where she had obtained fresh water, I emptied\r\ntwo cups of the scalding beverage and, after stripping myself of my wet\r\nclothing, was in a mood to have enjoyed the adventure had it not been\r\nfor my anxiety for the future. By overhauling a bunk I found an old\r\npair of trousers and an oil-coat, both smelling villainously of fish,\r\nand putting them on, wrapped a grimy blanket about me and returned to\r\nthe deck.\r\n\r\nEven during my short absence the wind had fallen decidedly, but the\r\nyoung lady was shivering in her summer dress as she sat looking\r\nover the blank water at the distant shore, and I could see that the\r\nloneliness filled her with an awe I well understood. She laughed a\r\nlittle as she noticed the figure I cut, but her chattering teeth belied\r\nher forced spirits.\r\n\r\n“You are freezing, Miss Edith. Go down and drink a cup of your own\r\ncoffee. Where did you get fresh water? The scuttle-butt was wrecked\r\nwith the rest.”\r\n\r\n“I melted hail-stones—there were plenty of them. Don’t you see I am\r\nsuperior to mere circumstance? You must go down, too; you must rest and\r\nkeep warm.”\r\n\r\n“I must do my resting here,” I replied, cutting the helm lashing.\r\n\r\n“What! All night?”\r\n\r\nI laughed at her simplicity. “I could not guarantee you a\r\ntomorrow—certainly not a rescue, if I stayed in the cabin.”\r\n\r\n“Then I will watch, too.”\r\n\r\n“It is far too cold—and—and I am afraid you are forgetting the\r\nproprieties,” I answered lightly. “I have much to think about.”\r\n\r\nI believe she suspected what was in my mind, for she asked soberly:\r\n\r\n“Were—were you referring to—to me?”\r\n\r\n“Could it be otherwise? And I was thinking of poor Maxwell and his\r\nprobable loss,” I answered, in an attempt to shift the subject I was\r\nnot yet ready to discuss.\r\n\r\nShe drew herself up with sudden hauteur. “Mr. Maxwell’s loss—probable\r\nor otherwise—shall be made more than good to him. As for me, I am\r\nstill above the circumstance that has brought us to this state,” she\r\nanswered, and, turning quickly, went below.\r\n\r\nIt was a rebuke, and I saw that I might better have taken her into my\r\nconfidence then and there, for Maxwell’s loss had had little weight\r\nwith me. It was her loss and possibly my own. Though her position in\r\nsociety was too well assured for her to suffer in character through\r\nan adventure of the sort we were experiencing, there would be many\r\nwho would talk behind their hands. When the facts were known—as they\r\nwere bound to be—advantage would be taken of the opportunity to cast\r\nreflections and give the smile incredulous to any explanation. A young\r\nman and a young woman adrift for an indefinite number of hours in the\r\nnight after having deliberately cut off communication with the shore\r\nwould be a tempting morsel for scandalmongers. And what then?\r\n\r\nIt was just that “what,” and another, which were bothering me. My\r\nlove for the girl was as pure as man’s love could be, yet after this\r\nwhat could I be to her? Must I cease to be even a friend? Was I to be\r\nsacrificed on the altar of circumstance, the force of which I asserted\r\nas strongly as she denied? I sat at the helm and turned my thoughts\r\ninward until the stars came out from behind the scattering clouds, and\r\nthe wind, grown colder, fell to a force that barely filled the jib. I\r\nlooked at my watch—it was past eleven. I was becoming faint for want\r\nof food, and, as the wind was now harmless, I dropped the helm and went\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nThe fire was almost out and the oil in the lamp so low that it added\r\nanother smell to the cabin. The girl lay on the hard locker fast\r\nasleep, and I could see that she had been weeping. For a time I gazed\r\nat her eagerly, then taking some food with me, stole back to my dreary\r\nwatch. As the hours waned so did my spirits. I may have dozed, but\r\nabout two o’clock the girl’s ghostly white dress appeared in the\r\ncompanionway and she stepped out on deck. She looked around at the\r\ndarkness for a moment, then came and seated herself by my side.\r\n\r\n“You have had an uncomfortable nap, I fear,” I said as I saw her\r\ndispirited face.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” wearily, “but how did you know?”\r\n\r\n“I went below and saw you. I am very sorry for you, Miss Edith.”\r\n\r\n“You saw I had been crying. I am more than sorry to have exposed my\r\nweakness to you. I was lonely and—and you did not wish me here. Is it\r\nso very wrong?”\r\n\r\n“I was only thinking of your comfort.”\r\n\r\n“Did you imagine it greater down there? And you said you were thinking\r\nof the proprieties and—and Maxwell.”\r\n\r\n“Of Maxwell—incidentally only.”\r\n\r\nShe made no answer to this. I had hoped she would, for now I was as\r\nready to talk of our peculiar situation as before I had been unwilling.\r\nBut the small hours of the morning are not conducive to discussion.\r\nThe girl was fagged out and silent in consequence. Once or twice she\r\nnodded, but refused to go below, though I urged her to get out of the\r\ncold. I finally prevailed on her to put on my coat, and then we sat in\r\nsilence. But Nature asserted herself at last, and she unconsciously but\r\ngradually drooped toward me until her head touched my shoulder, and\r\nthere it settled. I brought half of the blanket about her and passed my\r\narm around her waist that she might not pitch forward to the deck.\r\n\r\nAnd in this fashion we remained, I with the tiller in the hollow of\r\nmy left arm, and she in a heavy slumber, her face close to mine. I\r\nsat thus, immovable, until I was as sore and uncomfortable as though\r\nin bonds, but I may as well confess that I felt repaid for all I had\r\nundergone and was then undergoing through my self-enforced rigidity.\r\nI lost all sense of drowsiness and was never more wide awake in my\r\nlife than when I determined to take advantage of the cursed force of\r\ncircumstance and keep her by me as a right. I would use the argument\r\nplaced in my power, which argument was the force of circumstance\r\nitself. I had been a coward long enough.\r\n\r\nThe time went easily. The girl slept as quietly as a child, oblivious\r\nof all the world. My own mind undoubtedly strayed from purely practical\r\nmatters, but I was suddenly brought to my senses by the sight of a\r\nred and a green light, topped by a white one, bearing directly down\r\nupon us. The vessel with the night signals was almost into us before I\r\nrealized its approach. If the pilot of the oncoming tug—for as such I\r\nrecognized her—had been no more attentive than I, we should be a wreck\r\nin less than thirty seconds, and with no blame to him, as we carried no\r\nlight. Rudely awakening the girl I put the helm up and shouted with all\r\nmy power.\r\n\r\nThe black mass forged on until within two lengths of us. I heard the\r\npowerful throbbing of her engine, the tearing hiss and splash from her\r\ncut-water, and the churning of the propeller. In an instant more I\r\nwould hear the crashing of timbers, but as I strained my eyes on the\r\noncoming boat and threw my arm around the girl, ready for the worst, I\r\nsaw the shadow of a man as he ran from the engine-room to the wheel,\r\nand then the tug suddenly swerved and passed us so close that I could\r\nhave touched her rail! In an instant she had slid by and then I leaped\r\nup and shouted like one possessed:\r\n\r\n“Come to! Come to, for God’s sake! We are in distress!”\r\n\r\nThere was a hoarse answer and the vessel sank into the darkness. I\r\nthought we were to be abandoned and for an instant felt all the deep\r\nhopelessness of a shipwrecked mariner in mid-ocean as he marks the loss\r\nof a possible rescue. But presently I saw the green starboard light\r\nreappear and knew, when the red light joined it, they were working to\r\nreturn to us. There was the clang of a gong, a quick churning of the\r\nreversed wheel, and the tug slowed up close at hand, keeping way gently\r\nuntil it bumped against the sloop and a man leaped from its deck to\r\nours.\r\n\r\n“What’s the row here?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“We are crippled and adrift,” I answered. “I am no sailor, and there is\r\na lady aboard.”\r\n\r\nThe girl stood at my side as the man listened to my story, the\r\nlividness of dawn in the east just touching his coarse face. His little\r\neyes shifted from her to me incessantly, and when I had finished he\r\ngave an irritating laugh, for which I could have knocked him down with\r\na good grace.\r\n\r\n“Blowed away, hey!” he said, expectorating over the rail and wiping\r\nhis mouth with the back of his hand. “D’ye mean ye hadn’t sense enough\r\nto know when a cable’s bent an’ when it’s _on_bent? Wall, ’tain’t no\r\nbusiness o’ mine. Want to get aboard o’ us, hey? Yer green, fer a fact,\r\nan’ I’ll be frank with ye. If ye leaves the sloop she’ll be derelict,\r\nan’ I can pull her in an’ claim salvage. That’s the law. Course I’ll\r\ntake ye aboard if ye want, but ye had better bide here an’ give me a\r\nhundred dollars fer a tow to New Haven. I got a date there an’ can’t do\r\nbetter fer ye.”\r\n\r\n“Where are we now?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Sum’ers off the Thimbles.”\r\n\r\nI well knew that I was being taken advantage of, but a slight pressure\r\non my arm from the hand of Miss Edith told me it was no time for\r\nbargaining, so, after a deal of backing and going ahead, we found\r\nourselves under way behind the tug, I still at the helm to prove that\r\nthe sloop had not been deserted.\r\n\r\nSafe thus far I felt relieved, but, the first difficulty passed, the\r\nremaining and greater phase of the situation reasserted itself. For\r\na long time neither the girl nor I spoke, and I fancied her face was\r\nmore deeply anxious in its expression than I had yet seen it. The light\r\nbroadened; the shore showed faintly against a clear sky, and the stars\r\ngrew pale and disappeared. Probably two hours more would get us into\r\nharbor, and the subject of our adventure and our probable reception\r\nhome, even a plan for future movements, had not been touched upon.\r\nSomething must be said, but in my intense interest my brain went all\r\nadrift and my intended delicacy was lost in my first blundering speech.\r\n\r\n“You are looking tired, Miss Edith, but your last sleep was more\r\nrestful than your first.”\r\n\r\nIt was man-like stupidity. Her face flushed hotly as she turned it\r\naway, but presently she looked at me and said:\r\n\r\n“It has all been like a terrible dream, now that we are out of danger.\r\nIt seems days since we left the hotel, and—and—oh! what will papa\r\nsay—and Aunt Margaret? What will people think?” And she covered her\r\nface with her hands.\r\n\r\n“The last is not a knotty problem,” I replied gently, though I could\r\nnot spare her distress. “We will not be overburdened with Christ-like\r\ncharity, and the result may be hard for you to bear.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” she asked, dropping her hands.\r\n\r\n“Do you not see?” said I, as with my heart beating rapidly I went\r\nboldly to meet my fate. “Do you know so little of the world—of the\r\nvenom of it? We have done an innocent thing, but, forgive me, will\r\npeople believe it? Your father will be fiercely angry, society will be\r\nskeptical, and—and I would protect you from all scandal; I would bear\r\nyour father’s anger for you.”\r\n\r\nShe was rosy now and her lips were half apart, but she did not answer.\r\n\r\n“I know I am taking an undue advantage by making such a proposal here,\r\nbut it is the old force of circumstances which permits me. There is but\r\none way, Edith. Give me the right I would have—the right to protect\r\nyou! Does not your heart understand my meaning? We could then face the\r\nworld together and not care. No, that is not all,” I continued as I saw\r\nshe was about to speak. “God knows that affection lacks proper words\r\nto express it! I have been so fearful—that is why I have been dumb so\r\nlong! To me the gale has been a godsend, not a misfortune. Edith, must\r\nI be wrecked at last?”\r\n\r\nShe had turned away her face, but now she looked at me, not in anger\r\nnor amazement. As she fixed her beautiful eyes on mine I saw the tears\r\ncome into them and overflow, but she made no answer.\r\n\r\n“Have I hurt you?” I cried.\r\n\r\n“You are generous,” she said; “but are you honest now? Are you sure\r\nyou wish this? Is it me you really want? You are a man and will not be\r\nblamed—and I—well, I can live it down. The fault was mine, not yours.\r\nPerhaps you will regret; perhaps it is because you are sorry for me\r\nthat you offer me your—your protection. Oh! be sure—be sure!”\r\n\r\nI do not remember what I said or did then, but I know I had a ready\r\nanswer for this and urged it so vehemently, becoming oblivious to all\r\nelse, that the sloop yawed widely and I was called to earth by a shout\r\nfrom the tug to the effect that I had better “mind my eye” and see what\r\nin the devil I was about.\r\n\r\nIt was a strange wooing. Five o’clock in the morning is not a usual\r\nhour for inspiration, yet I was never more eloquent. Nor were the chief\r\nelements of the little drama picturesque—a woebegone and very much\r\nmussed-up young lady with unkempt hair, her figure lost in the folds of\r\na dirty blanket, and a man with the appearance of having been hurriedly\r\nstarched and rough-dried. But there was a new pink in the cheeks of the\r\none and a new light in the eyes of the other, as Edith, without a word\r\nin answer to my pleading, simply placed her soft hand in mine for a\r\nmoment, then brushing away her tears, ran below.\r\n\r\nTo the casual observer on the streets of New Haven no doubt we looked\r\nsomewhat time-worn, but this was partly mended by the milliner and the\r\ntailor. I was still as idiotic as a man is likely to be after a heavy\r\nstroke of good fortune, and it was when sitting in the hotel where I\r\nhad just penned the last of a number of telegrams that I turned to the\r\ngirl for my final triumph.\r\n\r\n“Edith, it was only yesterday morning that you scoffed at the force of\r\ncircumstance and I hinted at a tale I could write that would convince\r\nyou. But I need not use invention—we have acted a story ourselves. You\r\nhave been forced to capitulate. Was I not right?”\r\n\r\n“No, dear,” she returned softly. “My answer would have been the same\r\nhad you asked me long ago.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _Before and After_\r\n\r\n\r\nWANDERING WILLIE—Why wudn’t yer wanter be a millionaire, pard?\r\n\r\nWEARY RAGGLES—What’s de diff’rence?

For God’s sake, Janet, get to your room!” he said, trying to\r\nmake her comprehend what he meant, but she only stared at him vacantly,\r\nher white face filled with terror and her eyes fixed on the form on the\r\nfloor—that of a man in evening dress, across whose wide shirt front a\r\nstreak of blood was widening.\r\n\r\n“Why did he come here?” she asked, hiding the sickening sight with her\r\nhands before her eyes. “He swore he would not. This is horrible!”\r\n\r\n“Come, Janet, come,” remonstrated Fair, seizing her again. “It’s past\r\nseven, and they will be here presently. My God, can’t you see what this\r\nmeans? He’s dead!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, don’t, don’t,” she cried, shuddering as if the truth burned her\r\nbrain. “Ugh! See!” she gasped as she caught sight of a splash of red on\r\nher gown.\r\n\r\n“Yes, and you stand here! Are you mad?” muttered Fair, pushing her to\r\nthe door. “Go, now, and change—and be careful what you do with that\r\ndress. Hark! There’s the bell now. Remember, until they go, you must\r\nbetray no feeling. Are you great enough to do this? You won’t fail me?”\r\n\r\n“Anything, Maxwell, for your sake—but you—what will you do\r\nwith—_that_?” she asked, looking over her shoulder at the thing as if\r\nit fascinated her.\r\n\r\n“Leave everything to me,” he answered, pulling her chin around so that\r\nshe could not see. “I assume all. Remember, girl, it was I, do you\r\nunderstand? Go!”\r\n\r\nWhen he had finally closed the door upon her, he gave way to his\r\nagony—but only for a moment. With a quietness and rapidity that seemed\r\nto astonish even himself he placed the pistol upon the library-table,\r\nlocked both of the doors, drew the heavy red velvet curtains across the\r\nwindow and, bending over the fallen man, critically examined him.\r\n\r\nSatisfied that life was extinct, he pulled the body over to the\r\nfireplace, beside which, at right angles to the side of the room, there\r\nstood a large Italian chest with a very high carved back. Into this\r\nchest Fair lifted the limp body of the man and thoughtfully placed a\r\nnumber of heavy books and magazines upon it. Then carefully glancing\r\nabout the room and noticing no evidences of the crime, he sat down,\r\nwiped his brow, and closing his eyes, tried to let the stupendous facts\r\nof the last five minutes become realities to his mind—to formulate\r\nsome practical line of action in the future which those five minutes\r\nhad so fatally revolutionized.\r\n\r\nThe way that he started at a respectful tap at the library door showed\r\nhim what a terribly changed man he already was, and it was with a\r\npetulant, unnatural voice that he shouted: “Well? That you, Baxter?”\r\n\r\n“A man, sir, who insists upon seeing you, sir,” answered Baxter, Fair’s\r\nold butler, whom he had inherited with the estates and furniture, felt\r\ngrateful to as a faithful servant, and tolerated as an incompetent old\r\nbore.\r\n\r\n“Tell him to go to the devil, with my compliments, and to come to my\r\noffice if he really has business with me!” thundered Fair, not at all\r\nlike himself.\r\n\r\nBaxter shook his head as he said: “Very good, sir,” and toddled\r\ndownstairs, putting two and two together as servants will in the best\r\nregulated families.\r\n\r\nThe furniture seemed to be all out of place, so Fair pulled it this\r\nway and that, but wherever he placed it, it still seemed, to his mind,\r\nto show that a scuffle had taken place. After abandoning the idea of\r\ngetting it to look right, he devoted his anxious attention to his own\r\nappearance, which, although his faultless evening attire was immaculate\r\nand his thin, brown hair, with a touch of gray, was smooth and precise,\r\nseemed to him to betray the fact that he had passed through a scene of\r\nsome sort. Giving up the effort to discover just what was wrong, he\r\nunlocked the doors, drew his chair to the table and toyed with a pen\r\nand some sheets of paper on which he began several times to write.\r\n\r\n“Maxwell Fair, old chap,” he said to himself, looking up at the\r\nceiling, “this is pretty well near the end—but it’s all in the day’s\r\nwork.”\r\n\r\nThen he dashed off two telegrams and rang the bell, which Baxter\r\npromptly answered, having been standing at the door. “Did you ring,\r\nsir?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Fair. “Here, see that these two telegrams are sent\r\nimmediately—but wait. Baxter, a gentleman called about twenty minutes\r\nago. Did you let him in?”\r\n\r\nHe watched the old man’s face closely as he replied: “Yes, sir. A dark,\r\nforeign-looking gentleman, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” went on Fair, picking up the evening paper carelessly and\r\nspeaking with great indifference; “he is in my study. Just fetch his\r\ncoat and hat here, will you? And, by the way, did any of the other\r\nservants see him?”\r\n\r\n“The gentleman said he was an old friend of my lady’s—and none of the\r\nother servants saw him, sir. Aren’t you well, sir? I hope that nothing\r\nhas occurred, sir,” answered Baxter, with an old servant’s liberty.\r\n\r\n“No,” snapped Fair, with irritation, but going on more in his usual\r\nway. “Now look sharp and fetch the gentleman’s coat. A very old friend\r\nof Mrs. Fair’s. What was the other chap like—the one who wished to see\r\nme?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, him, sir,” replied Baxter, with a servant’s contempt for callers\r\nof his own class in society, “he were a quiet-spoken, ordinary sort of\r\nparty, sir, as said he come from Scotland Yard.”\r\n\r\nFair was too well in hand by this time to wince as he heard this bit\r\nof disturbing coincidence, but he said to himself: “My word, they are\r\nprompt—but, damn it, they can’t have known!” Then, happening to look\r\nup and seeing the old butler, “What are you waiting for?”\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon, sir,” gently began Baxter, shuffling nearer to\r\nFair, “but, Mr. Fair, sir—Master Maxwell—you’ll forgive an old\r\nservant that served your father and grandfather before you, sir. There\r\nain’t no trouble like, or anythink a-hangin’ over us, is there, sir?\r\nOne of the parlormaids thought that she heard a shot, sir—and——”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes,” quickly responded Fair, with a laugh, “I was cleaning this\r\nold pistol and it went off. Get on now. Trouble? Why, look at me,\r\nBaxter. I’m the luckiest dog in the world. I have just made another\r\nfortune.”\r\n\r\n“Thank God for that, sir,” quietly replied old Baxter, moving toward\r\nthe door, at which he turned and said, “The gentleman will be dining,\r\nof course?”\r\n\r\n“No, he can’t stop. In fact, he wishes to leave the house unobserved\r\nby our guests when we are at dinner—so fetch his hat and coat,” said\r\nFair, again settling down to his evening paper.\r\n\r\n“I was forgetting, sir,” once more the querulous old voice began, “that\r\nMiss Mettleby said that the children are coming to say good night——”\r\n\r\n“The children?” exclaimed Fair, caught off his guard. “No—good God,\r\nno!—that is, I mean I shall be engaged. Tell Miss Mettleby so. Be off.”\r\n\r\nWith suspicions now thoroughly aroused and full of misgivings Baxter\r\ndid as he was bid, and his master jerked the paper open again and\r\nslapped at the crease to make the sheet flat. But his eyes wandered\r\naimlessly.\r\n\r\n“The children—gad! I had forgotten them,” he muttered as he thought\r\nwith horror what this all meant to them. Time after time he tried to\r\nread the leading article which was about his own brilliant achievement,\r\nbut with a mad spasm he crumpled the newspaper into a ball and flung it\r\nacross the great room, exclaiming, “Why didn’t the infernal blackguard\r\nknow when he was well off?”\r\n\r\n“The gentleman’s coat and hat, sir,” said Baxter, coming in annoyingly.\r\n\r\n“Very well—now go,” retorted Fair peevishly. “Ask Mr. Travers to come\r\nup here the moment he arrives. Here, here—you are forgetting the\r\ntelegrams. You seem to forget everything lately. You are too careless.”\r\n\r\n“So I am, so I am,” quavered the poor old beggar, with tears in his\r\nvoice. “I shall soon be of very little service, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense,” answered Fair, touched by the old fellow’s feeling. “You\r\nhave twenty years of good work before you. But, I say, Baxter, I forgot\r\nto tell you—we are leaving town tomorrow morning. Discharge all of the\r\nservants tonight. Hear me? All of them—tonight.”\r\n\r\n“Tonight, sir?” exclaimed Baxter, dropping his little silver card-tray.\r\n“They will be expecting a month’s notice, sir.”\r\n\r\n“That means a month’s pay, I suppose,” answered Fair sharply. “Give\r\nthem a year’s pay, if you like—but get them out of the house tomorrow\r\nmorning before nine o’clock. You see, I have sold the house, and the\r\nnew owner takes possession at ten. You understand me? We shall, of\r\ncourse, take you and Anita with us—to the continent, you know.”\r\n\r\n“I hear, sir,” replied Baxter, adding, after a dazed and groping moment,\r\n“some of them have been in our family’s service for twenty years. That\r\nis a long time, sir, and they will think it hard to be——”\r\n\r\n“By Jove, that’s so!” exclaimed Fair, pacing up and down with a growing\r\nsense of disgust and rage at having to cramp his future into the\r\nignominious bondage of a desperate situation. “No, I can’t turn them\r\naway. Tell them that I shall instruct my solicitor to provide for them\r\nfor life—yes, tell them that. Come here, Baxter,” he went on, rapidly\r\nlosing control of himself and pathetically stretching his hands out as\r\nif to grasp the love and sympathy of someone; “I haven’t been a hard\r\nmaster, have I? No. And when the end comes, you won’t turn against me?\r\nI—I—I—oh, damn it, clear out of here, won’t you?”\r\n\r\n“Why, my dear young master, whatever ails you, sir?” cried the old\r\nbutler, grasping the hand that Fair waved to him. “If you did but know\r\nhow we all love you, sir, perhaps you would——”\r\n\r\n“Do you? Do you?” broke in Fair feverishly. “That’s right, too. But,\r\nBaxter, things have gone wrong, and in a few hours I may need all the\r\nlove that you or anybody else will give me. Get out of here, can’t you?”\r\n\r\nBaxter threw his arms about the young man’s neck. “Come what may, sir,\r\nthere shall not be found a better friend than your poor old servant.”\r\nAnd then, holding the lapels of Fair’s coat, he added, with much\r\nembarrassment and tenderness, “And, sir, if I might make so bold—I\r\nhave close on a thousand pounds in the funds, and every penny——”\r\n\r\n“Every penny is mine, you were going to say?” interrupted Fair,\r\nsmiling even in his despair at the old man’s estimate of his needs.\r\n“Thanks, thanks, old comrade; but no amount of money can stave off\r\nthe blue devils at times, you know. You knew my fathers, Baxter. They\r\nwere a race of damned fools who were ready at a moment’s notice to\r\nlose everything for an idea! I am their son—I am their heir—and the\r\ndamnedest fool of the lot.”\r\n\r\nAs he said this Fair raised his head with a look so defiant, so full\r\nof an almost supernatural exaltation, so nearly that which shines in\r\nthe eye of the victim of a fixed idea or of a fatal hallucination that\r\nBaxter, who was not expert at psychological analysis, felt a vague\r\nmisgiving that his eccentric young master had suddenly gone off his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nAnd one more penetrating than old Baxter would have been amazed at the\r\nchange which had come over the expression of the agitated man. The look\r\nof horror and disgust and consternation was gone, and in its place had\r\ncome the fire of enthusiasm, the sublime uplift of the martyr, the\r\nterrifying concentration of some irrational, uncalculating, final _idée\r\nfixe_.\r\n\r\n“See who that is,” he said to the butler when a knock was heard.\r\n\r\n“It is Miss Mettleby, sir,” replied Baxter from the door.\r\n\r\n“Oh, come in, come in,” called out Fair with unaccountable eagerness.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II\r\n\r\nThe girl who entered as he spoke had come into Mrs. Fair’s employ as a\r\ngoverness from a Somersetshire parsonage. She was tall, carried herself\r\nwith the unconscious ease of one who, with a nature susceptible of the\r\ndeepest emotion and broadest culture, has grown up in the open and in\r\nignorance of the world, and at eight-and-twenty had settled down to the\r\nmonotony and hopelessness of a life of thankless dependence.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment of coming into the family of the famous financier Kate\r\nMettleby had felt, as who had not, the subtle charm of his personality;\r\nyet with her it was not a natural appreciation of a character at\r\nonce brilliant and winsome, but rather a sort of terrifying though\r\nexquisitely pleasurable sense of oneness with the man. Hers was a\r\nmind far too devoid of precedents and mental experience to be capable\r\nor even desirous of analyzing the feeling which she was aware she\r\nentertained for the calm, strong, self-reliant father of the\r\nchildren whom she was to teach. She knew only that Maxwell Fair was\r\ndifferent—oh, so different—from all other men, and that, without the\r\nfaintest shadow of love for him—which her simple, country mind would\r\nhave thought sinful and degrading—he, or that mystical something that\r\nhe stood for in her mind, had made forever impossible all thought of\r\never loving another.\r\n\r\nHad she been asked to name the reason for so abnormal and morbid a\r\nfancy, she would have been utterly powerless to do so. Maxwell Fair\r\nwas as much of a puzzle to her as he was to everybody, both in society\r\nand in the city. This man, whose name was now in everybody’s mouth as\r\nthe most daring and successful operator on ’Change, had come to London\r\nless than five years before with nothing, so far as was known, but the\r\nentailed and heavily burdened estates in Norfolk which he had inherited\r\nfrom his father, who, old men declared, had been little short of a\r\nmadman.\r\n\r\nBy a series of dashing ventures in mining stocks Fair had attracted\r\nattention, and, what was more to the purpose, accumulated enough ready\r\ncash to enable him to avail himself of the situation then confronting\r\nthe speculative world. At the very top of the Kaffir and other South\r\nAfrican securities boom, when men were buying with an eagerness and\r\nrecklessness amounting to frenzy, Fair was quietly selling, so that\r\nwhen the crash came and the breaking out of the Boer War knocked the\r\nbottom out of values, he had the satisfaction of buying back at panic\r\nprices the very shares which he had prudently disposed of at absurdly\r\nexaggerated prices some time before.\r\n\r\nEstablishing his family in the mansion which he had bought in the\r\nprincely Carlton House Terrace, Fair rapidly became as fascinating\r\nand puzzling in society as he had proved Napoleonic and baffling in\r\nThrogmorton street, where was his office. Women found him quaintly\r\nand refreshingly chivalrous and almost annoyingly happy as a\r\nconversationalist, while men who sought his acquaintance with an eye\r\nto business connections—and were disappointed—discovered that the chap\r\nfrom whom they had hoped to learn the secrets of success was a fellow\r\nof infinite jest, a capital _raconteur_ and a frank, generous, genial\r\ncompanion withal.\r\n\r\nSuch was Maxwell Fair when once more the newspapers announced that he\r\nhad disposed of the celebrated Empire Mines stock which he had picked\r\nup—after a personal inspection of the property in Mexico—when nobody\r\nelse would touch it, at the staggering figure of over ten times what\r\nhe had paid for the shares, netting by the transaction close upon two\r\nhundred thousand pounds.\r\n\r\nAt innumerable dinner-tables at that moment he was being discussed,\r\nenvied and lauded to the skies—and he himself sat with flushed,\r\nnervous face awaiting guests, and now bidding the strangest woman whom\r\nhe had ever met enter with some message from the nursery.\r\n\r\n“The children are ready for bed, Mr. Fair,” said Miss Mettleby,\r\nstanding in that humble posture which he had begged her never to\r\nassume, because it somehow irritated him very much. “Are they to come\r\ndown to say good night? Or shall you come up?”\r\n\r\n“That will do, Baxter,” said Fair, noticing that the old butler still\r\nputtered about the room as if intending to remain. Baxter reluctantly\r\nwent out and closed the door, which, one is disposed to fear, meant\r\nthat the interested old servant did not go far on its other side.\r\n\r\n“I am engaged,” continued Fair, looking up at Miss Mettleby. “I will go\r\nup and kiss them afterward. Sit down—no, not on that chest, please.”\r\n\r\n“Why not?” asked Miss Mettleby, surprised. “It’s my favorite seat—it\r\nis so comfortable.”\r\n\r\n“It makes me uncomfortable to see you sit there—at any time,” answered\r\nFair, endeavoring to appear whimsical and indifferent, as usual.\r\n“So—thank you. That’s better. Well, Kate, the three months are\r\nover—to the very day, I believe. Coincidences are strange sometimes,\r\nare they not? The time is up. Have you decided?”\r\n\r\n“I have,” returned Kate so quickly that he started.\r\n\r\n“Well?” he asked, after waiting in vain for her to go on.\r\n\r\n“I leave Mrs. Fair’s service on the first of next month,” quietly\r\nreplied the governess, evidently with a quietness which cost her much,\r\nand as if bracing herself for the crisis of her life. “I have secured\r\nanother position—with Lord Linklater’s family. I have advised Mrs.\r\nFair already.”\r\n\r\n“I’m glad of it—why, you look hurt. Fie!” taunted Fair. “Such virtue\r\nshould be pleased, not hurt. The eternal feminine will out, though,\r\nalways.”\r\n\r\n“Pardon me,” retorted Kate stiffly, “I am heartily glad that you are\r\nglad. May I ask what has moved you to so commendable a frame of mind?\r\nIf you had a conscience, I would say that it had at last awakened.\r\nAh, I see—it was pride. What a mercy it is that when nature left\r\nconscience out of the aristocracy it supplied them with pride! Were it\r\nnot for good form, how many gentlemen would there be? I congratulate\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“Go on,” urged Fair, settling back into his chair with the smile of\r\namused superiority which he very often indulged in, contrary to his\r\nreal feeling, to draw her out. “By Jove, you have enough cant to\r\nstock a whole meeting of dissenting old ladies. What a mercy it is,\r\nas you would put it, that when heaven forgot to endow young females\r\nwith common sense, it gave them such a superabundance of pharisaical\r\ntommy-rot! If it were not for maiden aunts and governesses, how much\r\n_talk_ of virtue—talk, I say—would there be in this naughty world?”\r\n\r\n“It is well that there are some who, even by talking, remind men\r\nthat there is, in theory at least, such a thing as honor,” replied\r\nKate, with a sneaking notion that she was talking very platitudinous\r\nplatitudes.\r\n\r\n“Oh, entirely so,” drawled Fair sneeringly. “But isn’t it a pity that\r\nthe milk of human kindness should be soured by the vinegar of\r\npuritanical self-righteousness? I promised you that I would not speak\r\nto you for three months. I have kept my promise. Now I am going to\r\nhave my say—now, now, don’t fidget, I beg of you! A very different\r\nman is going to speak to you now from the one who said what I said to\r\nyou on the deck of the sinking yacht that night. Do you remember, Miss\r\nMettleby?”\r\n\r\n“I wish that I could hope some day to forget it,” answered the girl,\r\nflaming scarlet.\r\n\r\nFair rose as if trying to control emotions that were shaking his\r\nfoundations. “Don’t you see?” he burst out, confronting her; “don’t you\r\nsee that your hopelessness in that connection is the result of only one\r\npossible cause? You love me.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Fair!” screamed the governess, springing to her feet with a\r\ngesture of protest that died in the making, for the clutch of the truth\r\nof his words was about her throat. “Truly, sir, you forget your own\r\ndignity and my dependent and defenseless position. I cannot hear this\r\nfrom you, sir.”\r\n\r\n“But you must hear me—you shall hear me,” he flung back at her. Then\r\nwith a tenderness that was harder to resist: “And, Miss Mettleby—Kate,\r\nyou really need not fear or try to shun me now. God knows, I shall be\r\nhelpless and harmless enough. Yes, Kate, the rich and powerful Maxwell\r\nFair will in a day or two be buried under the contempt and scorn of\r\nall good men. But, by the right of dying men, I claim that I may speak\r\nto you. I am glad that you are leaving us. I wish to God that you had\r\nnever come. Among your many virtues you include courage. May I confide\r\nin you? Ask your advice? Lean on you?”\r\n\r\nHad he struck her, had he pressed on her a suit that bore dishonor on\r\nits face, she could have met him, young and untutored in the arts of\r\nlife though she was. But when the great, calm, finished man to whom she\r\nhad looked up in an unspoken worship laid his hand pleadingly upon her\r\nnow, and those dear, merry lips of his quivered and almost failed\r\nto shape his piteous cry that she should help him, it was with a\r\ntremendous effort that she conquered the impulse to throw her arms\r\nabout his neck, and said calmly:\r\n\r\n“Mr. Fair, this is scarcely kind of you. My God, how ill you look!\r\nForgive me, sir, if I am the unhappy cause of any of your present\r\nsuffering.”\r\n\r\n“Kate,” he said at length, looking wistfully at her.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Mr. Fair,” she replied, hushed and unable to protest further.\r\n\r\n“Kate, you have been with us for two years,” he began, speaking very\r\nlow. “Little by little you grew into my life. The hungry yearning for\r\nI knew not what, the restless madness, the sense of emptiness and of\r\ndespair, all that had turned my life into the aimless thing it was,\r\nseemed to give place within me to a strange, new spirit of hope and\r\nfaith and comfort. And you, you, little woman, were the cause of that\r\nwondrous change. As I saw you moving about the house so sweetly, as\r\nI heard you singing the children to sleep, as I noted the difference\r\nbetween you and the women who had made my world, I came slowly to\r\nrealize that you were all to me. Did I tell you this? Did I show it in\r\nany way?”\r\n\r\n“You were a gentleman,” replied Miss Mettleby, regaining control of\r\nherself sufficiently to speak as she thought she should and no longer\r\nas she wished. “And, anyhow, had you forgot your honor and my position\r\nso far as to have spoken, you know that I would have left your roof at\r\nonce. Please, may I not go now?”\r\n\r\nHer manner galled him as all that was not genuine did always, and he\r\nwas about to sneer at the phrase, “leave your roof,” but he at once\r\nrecognized that to her mind, in which truths were broad, general,\r\naxiomatic propositions, and not complex and subtle many-sided phases\r\nof propositions, there would be no halting ground between her present\r\nattitude and actual dishonor. So he went on.\r\n\r\n“No; please do not go yet. Good heavens! when I am done you will regret\r\nyour wish to leave me. Well then, I did not speak to you. I quite\r\nignored you, treated you like a servant. But it was from no sense of\r\nhonor, mark you; for I deny that honor, yours or mine, would have been\r\nlost by speaking. Nor was it from a squeamish fear of the proprieties\r\nand the conventionalities that I refrained, for I would brush the world\r\naside as so much stubble if it should stand between me and my right to\r\ntruth. No, Kate, it was not from the lofty principles which you imagine\r\nto be God’s, nor from my foolish pride as an aristocrat—how could\r\nyou, even for a moment, think me so base? I remained silent because,\r\nwhether for good or ill, I have devoted all I am to an idea, a cause, a\r\npurpose.”\r\n\r\nAs he spoke these last few words a number of conflicting thoughts\r\npassed through Kate’s mind. With only the vaguest notion of his\r\nmeaning, jealousy shot a stinging, momentary, utterly illogical shaft\r\nthrough her heart, which was followed by a profoundly feminine feeling\r\nof injury in being thus coolly told that she would have been addressed\r\nhad not some paramount other interest absorbed his mind.\r\n\r\n“Indeed?” she remarked, with what she thought was biting sarcasm, but\r\nwhich a much less penetrating mind than Maxwell Fair’s would have at\r\nonce taken as an indication of jealousy and love. “And so you plume\r\nyourself, do you, on considering your wife and children an idea, a\r\ncause, a purpose, to which, for good or ill, you have made up your mind\r\nto give all that you are? Heroic, I must say, and so unusual.”\r\n\r\n“Governess! Sunday-school moralizer!” he jeered at her. “No, nor was\r\nI deterred by that still more arrant humbug about ‘penniless and\r\ndependent females’ that you learned from our past masters of humbug\r\nand lachrymose moral biliousness, the great novelists. No, it was not\r\nbecause you were a poor orphan girl in my employ, and, consequently,\r\nincapable of defending yourself, that I refrained from speaking to\r\nyou. Rubbish! The cant of moral snobs! As if the virtue of poor girls\r\nwas made of weaker stuff than that of rich ones! My God, did I want\r\nvictims, I swear I would pursue them in drawing-rooms with more success\r\nthan in the servants’ hall.”\r\n\r\n“I really cannot see what all this has to do with you and me,” coldly\r\nremarked Miss Mettleby when he paused.\r\n\r\n“You will see presently,” Fair answered, ignoring her freezing manner\r\nand with rapidly growing intensity and feeling. “I remained silent. I\r\ncrucified my heart, denied my soul. But that night, Kate, when you and\r\nI alone were clinging to the yacht and neither of us hoped to see the\r\nsun again, I told you. It was my right. It was your right as well.”\r\n\r\n“And, half dead as I was, I shamed you, sir, and called you what you\r\nwere by every law of God and man and honor,” she flung back at him with\r\na flush of remembered nobility very comforting in the light of more\r\nrecent less lofty thoughts.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Fair, with his old-time elevation and calmness, which\r\nwere a mainspring of his influence over her; “yes, the habits of a\r\nlifetime cling to us, Kate, making us dare to lie upon the very edge\r\nof death and coming judgment. I loved you, and I told you. You loved\r\nme, and denied it. And we were both about to face eternity! Which of us\r\nwould have faced it with the cleaner heart?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, don’t, don’t!” she cried, shrinking from him. “You know I cannot\r\nargue with you. But I am sure that I was right, that I am right now.\r\nPlease let me go.”\r\n\r\n“In a moment, in a moment,” he answered, grasping her two hands. “I\r\nprobably will never see you again, Kate—so let me now speak out. I\r\nasked you to take three months to think it over, and promised you that\r\nI would then give you the reasons for my strange conduct and beg of you\r\nto face the world with me for our great love’s sake.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she said, freeing her hands; “you said you would be able to\r\nconvince me that there was no dishonor in your love, no wrong in what\r\nyou would propose that we should do. Three months you gave me—three\r\nmonths. Why, Mr. Fair, three minutes would be enough for me to reach\r\nthe only possible decision which you, an English gentleman, can ask a\r\nyoung and unprotected English girl like me to make. But I was grateful\r\nfor your three months’ silence. If you could trust yourself, I am\r\ncompelled to own that I could not so trust myself. I love you—may God\r\nforgive me, but I cannot help it! But your chivalrous respite of three\r\nmonths has given me a grip upon myself. I do not fear myself. I do not\r\nfear even you. I am to leave your house, never to see you again. And\r\nsome day you will thank me.”\r\n\r\nThere had been a wondrous new development of strength and beauty in her\r\nas she spoke, and Fair had watched her with profoundest feeling.\r\n\r\n“Kate, Kate, you wrong me, upon my honor!” he cried when she ceased.\r\n“The promise that I made you was one that I could keep. There is a\r\nmystery, an awful something in my life, that has through all these\r\nyears kept me so falsely true, that, being true to one great object\r\nfixed on me by my fate, I’ve been compelled to seem what I am not to\r\nall the world. To get you, Kate, to rest at last my broken heart upon\r\nyour love, I was this very night to break the self-imposed conditions\r\nof my weird life-purpose. God! how I counted them, these long, slow\r\ndays, waiting for this one! An hour ago I still supposed that I could\r\nfold you on my heart tonight and tell you everything! I thought that I\r\ncould say the word that would dispel your doubts and make you—you only\r\nin the world see me as God does. But now I cannot. Be brave and hear\r\nme, Kate,” he added, holding her arm, which was trembling under the\r\ninfluence of his own great passion. “I am a criminal. I have done that\r\nwhich must make you despise me, must drive me from the society of men,\r\nand bring me to the gibbet.”\r\n\r\nForgetting all her previous moods, Miss Mettleby allowed the choking\r\nman to lean against her as she cried. “You are ill. Take my arm—so.\r\nAnd oh, believe me, that nothing that you imagine you have done,\r\nnothing that you could do, can rob you of one poor and weak, but brave\r\nand true girl’s friendship. Do let me call your wife. Yes, I will call\r\nher—let me. And you must tell her. Tell her—her, not me.”\r\n\r\n“Stop! Stop!” cried Fair, frantically holding the struggling girl, who\r\nwas making for the door; “and be quiet. Hear me. It’s all that I can\r\nsay, but it will show you, Kate, that, if I am a criminal, I mean you\r\nno dishonor. You want to call my wife. _I have no wife!_ She is not——”\r\n\r\nHe was cut short by Baxter, who stood at the door at that moment and\r\nannounced, “Mr. Travers.” Travers entered smiling, and Fair, with a\r\ncompleteness of mastery over his feelings which Kate could not believe\r\ntrue, sang out: “Travers, old chap, glad to see you! What’s the good\r\nword?”\r\n\r\nMiss Mettleby slipped out of the library and ran up to her little room.\r\nShe knew that now it would be impossible to see him again that night,\r\nas it would be late when the last guest had gone. Throwing herself on\r\nher bed, she tried to make it all out. His crime—his saying that he\r\nhad no wife—the awful something in his life which, for her sake, he\r\nwas to have broken from that very night—what did it all mean?\r\n\r\nShe could grasp no idea out of the chaos long enough for it to\r\ntake shape in her mind. She drifted helplessly down the torrent of\r\ntumultuous fears and hopes and hungers, knowing only one thing—that\r\nshe loved him, she loved him.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\nThe man who now came in was that lovable, unlucky, wonderfully clever\r\nDick Travers, who was forty and a failure when a manager, miraculously\r\nexperiencing a lucid interval, brought out his five hundredth play,\r\n“The Idiot,” since which time five hundred managers coquet with him\r\nfor each new play. But all this was after the time now reached. Dick\r\nTravers was still a failure whom Fair had met before his own ascent to\r\nopulence, and to whom he was drawn by several ties, among which was\r\ntheir common taste for etchings in dry-point and the more tangible\r\ncommon interest in yachting and hatred for most things foreign.\r\n\r\n“Pretty well right, thanks,” replied Travers to Fair’s welcome, adding\r\nimmediately with much excitement, “and by Jove, old man, have you seen\r\nthe evening papers? You’ve got a lot of those Empire shares, haven’t\r\nyou? Well, the blooming things went up to two hundred and eighty today.”\r\n\r\n“Not really?” exclaimed Fair, enjoying the innocent’s naïve idea\r\nthat all this was news to the man who had put up the shares to that\r\naltitude. “Baxter, some brandy and soda. Look sharp.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir; thank you, sir,” answered Baxter with spirit as he trotted\r\nout after the brandy and soda, pathetically clutching the hope that his\r\nyoung master’s case could not be so desperate after all, since he was\r\nmeeting his friend’s high spirits with equally high ones.\r\n\r\n“You picked up these shares, didn’t you,” asked Travers, sitting on\r\nthe end of the table, “when they were being kicked about the Street at\r\nabout twenty? Lord, what a lucky devil you are. I, on the contrary,\r\nbought those beastly Australian King shares, and they went up also—in\r\nsmoke.”\r\n\r\n“I am lucky, am I not?” acquiesced Fair, glancing over at the chest.\r\n“In fact, I wanted to talk to you tonight about myself. Do you see this\r\npistol? Do you recognize it?” he went on, with so abrupt a change of\r\nsubject and expression that Travers stood up with an uncomfortable look.\r\n\r\n“Perfectly,” he answered, after taking up the pistol and looking at it;\r\n“it is the one poor Ponsonby gave you—but what’s the game, old man?”\r\n\r\n“Examine it. Is it loaded?” asked Fair with tormenting mystery.\r\n\r\n“Yes. All the chambers are full. Translate, please,” said Travers after\r\ncarefully inspecting the revolver, with growing annoyance.\r\n\r\n“Oh, come, now, look at it carefully,” cried Fair, with what seemed\r\nabsurd warmth to Travers. “Isn’t one of the chambers empty? Have\r\nanother look.”\r\n\r\n“Right you are—one cartridge has been discharged,” answered Travers.\r\n\r\n“Recently, wouldn’t you say?” continued Fair.\r\n\r\n“Yes, perhaps,” replied Travers, becoming seriously disturbed by this\r\nmost unwonted development of character in the hard-headed and practical\r\nFair. “But what the deuce is the game, you know?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing,” answered Fair, putting down the pistol and turning from the\r\ntable as if about to turn from the gruesome subject as well. “I had a\r\nfancy that I wanted you to notice these little details. I may ask you\r\nto remember them some day. By the way, you are going to Drayton Hall\r\ntomorrow?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” quickly replied Travers, only too glad to follow some new lead.\r\n“Sir Nelson asked me at the club last night. Who is to be there?\r\nDrayton is no end of a bore, you know, when Lady Poynter has what she\r\ncalls ‘the literary set’ down. The men are a lot of insufferable prigs,\r\nand the women—oh, hang it, you know what they are.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” drawled Fair, himself again; “if one could ever meet the women\r\nwho write! But one can’t, you know—it is the women who think they\r\nwrite that one meets. But we are safe tomorrow. Poynter assured me that\r\nnobody with brains would be down—so we count upon a comfortable time.\r\nAnyhow, I shall be running back to town in the evening, and, before\r\nI forget it, I want you and Allyne to give me the night—here at the\r\nhouse. I have a bit of rather serious work on my hands.”\r\n\r\n“I’m yours, of course,” answered Travers. “But, I say, old chap, let\r\nup on this melodrama, can’t you? Be a man and try to bear up bravely\r\nunder your increased income of sixty thousand more a year. Now I have\r\na jolly good right to chronic blue devils, for I never succeeded at\r\nanything in my life, as you know. But you—gad! it’s treason for you to\r\ndo a blessed thing but chant pæans of victory—and pour libations on\r\nyourself.”\r\n\r\n“Never fear,” laughed Fair, “I’m the happiest man alive. You have\r\nno idea of what I possess. Why, hang it, man,” he went on with an\r\nunpleasant ring in his voice that puzzled and alarmed Travers, “I tell\r\nyou, I have things that would surprise you—in this very room. Ah,\r\nhere’s the brandy and soda.”\r\n\r\nBaxter entered and deposited the tray on the table, but, although he\r\ntook an unconscionable long time to arrange the decanters and glasses,\r\nhe could get no hint of the drift of the conversation, as neither of\r\nthe gentlemen spoke until the absorbing process of “mixing” was over\r\nand Baxter gone.\r\n\r\n“I forgot to tell you,” began Travers, with his glass in his hand,\r\n“that I saw that Cuban chap, Lopez, this morning, and he wants me to\r\ndine with him to meet another yellow gent from the land of cigars, who\r\nsays that he knows you, or rather, Mrs. Fair. Can you imagine who he\r\nmay be?”\r\n\r\n“It is probably a man named Mendes, a very rich planter,” answered\r\nFair, after a few moments, during which he was critically studying the\r\nrich amber color of his drink as he held his glass between his eye and\r\nthe light. “I fancy it must be Mendes, for he was in London today—but\r\nhe left very suddenly this afternoon. Have another drink.”\r\n\r\n“Left, eh?” asked Travers, filling his glass. “Thank heaven, for then\r\nI sha’n’t have to meet him. I hate those Cubans. Always seem to have\r\nsomething up their sleeve—and to have forgot tubbing that morning.”\r\n\r\n“But you would like Mendes, I’m sure,” returned Fair, smiling. “Plays\r\nchess better than any man on earth, I believe. He was good enough to\r\ncall to say good-bye, although he was in a beastly hurry. If you had\r\nkept your promise and dropped in for a go at billiards, you would have\r\nmet him. I was able to do him a trifling service at one time ages ago,\r\nand the fellow seems never to forget it. I’m sorry he’s gone; I am,\r\nreally.”\r\n\r\n“Not returning, then?” inquired Travers, with no very great interest.\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid not,” replied Fair, with a slight uneasiness. “I’d give a\r\ngood deal to see him walk in that door this minute, though. You see——”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Allyne is in the billiard-room, sir,” announced Baxter at the door.\r\n\r\n“Run in and tell Allyne that I’ll join you presently, will you, Dick,\r\nthat’s a good chap?” said Fair, with more of command than suggestion\r\nin his tone, so that Travers obeyed and followed Baxter down to the\r\nbilliard-room.\r\n\r\nIn an instant Fair’s whole bearing changed. Closing the door, he picked\r\nup the hat and coat that Baxter had brought from the passage and thrust\r\nthem into the large chest, carefully averting his face as he did so.\r\nDropping into his chair he wiped the cold sweat from his face and\r\nsignaled to the crack in the side door that whoever it was that had\r\nbeen gently opening it for some little time might now come in. As he\r\nknew, it was Mrs. Fair, who then entered, attired in another dinner\r\ngown.\r\n\r\nMotioning to her that she must speak softly, Fair said: “Allyne and\r\nTravers are in the billiard-room. The rest will be coming presently.\r\nHow are you, poor little Janet?”\r\n\r\nShe came and sat on the arm of his chair and put her face down upon his\r\nshoulder. “Am I awake?” she moaned after a few seconds. “Oh, Maxwell,\r\nfor God’s sake, wake me and tell me that I have been dreaming. My God,\r\nwhat can we do? Where is—it?”\r\n\r\n“Hush!” replied Fair, holding his arm about her. “Try not to think of\r\nhim, dear. Be brave, sweet, for a couple of hours. Don’t be afraid.\r\nHave I ever failed you?”\r\n\r\n“No, no—never, Maxwell—God bless you, never,” she sobbed. “But,\r\noh—look, look—quick, hide that pistol!”\r\n\r\n“I left it there on purpose,” he answered quietly and reassuringly.\r\n“Now don’t in any way try to alter my plans. I have thought more in the\r\nlast half-hour than I ever did in all the rest of my life. Everything\r\nis provided for. At this time tomorrow night you and the children will\r\nbe safe on the continent. What did you do with that other dress?”\r\n\r\n“Ugh,” she shuddered; “while I was taking it off baby came running into\r\nthe room and wanted to touch the horrible spots. I wrapped the accursed\r\nthing up in stout paper and gave it to Miss Mettleby. Why, you are not\r\nafraid that she—but no. Well, I told her it was a surprise for you,\r\nand she will hide it somewhere while we are at dinner, and tell me\r\nafter.”\r\n\r\n“That was a wise move,” said Fair. “And now, Janet, a brave heart, old\r\ngirl, and this beastly dinner will be over. What a trump you are!”\r\n\r\n“Trust me,” she replied, looking with infinite loyalty at the man who\r\nhad stood for so much so strangely much in her torn and beaten life.\r\n“Trust me. But, Maxwell, when the end comes, as it most surely will,\r\nyou will explain how it came to be done—you will tell them how his\r\ncrimes deserved this. For the children’s sake you won’t be foolish and\r\nsacrifice yourself to protect others? Oh, promise me, promise me.”\r\n\r\n“Poor little woman!” he answered, with great tenderness. “Yes, yes, all\r\nshall be told. Hush! I hear them on the stairs. Yes, they are coming.”\r\n\r\nWhen Baxter with much ceremony threw open the door of the library, Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Maxwell Fair stood there radiantly cordial and unruffled to\r\nwelcome the three or four intimate friends who were dining with them.\r\n\r\n“Sir Nelson and Lady Poynter, Mrs. March, Mr. Travers, Mr. Allyne,”\r\nsolemnly announced Baxter at the door, and these several ladies and\r\ngentlemen, all chatting and beaming, hurried forward to pay their\r\nrespects to the most talked of man in London and his gracious and\r\nhandsome wife.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n“My dear Lady Poynter, it was so good of you and Sir Nelson to honor\r\nus—Mrs. March, so glad,” said Mrs. Fair, advancing to greet them.\r\n\r\n“Good evening, good evening, everybody,” blustered old Sir Nelson,\r\nwith a red face and a warm heart. “And, Fair, my lad, I see that those\r\nshares that you put me into behaved rather well today. You must have\r\nmade a rather neat turn in them. Come, now, how was it?”\r\n\r\n“Pretty well, Sir Nelson,” answered Fair. “I sold out just before the\r\nclose at two hundred and seventy-five.”\r\n\r\n“Then you must have cleared a hundred thousand net?” said Sir Nelson.\r\n\r\n“A bit over double that amount, I think my brokers said,” replied Fair,\r\nwith no more feeling than he would have shown in announcing a change in\r\nthe weather.\r\n\r\n“Hear that, now,” pouted Mrs. March. “Why can’t you gentlemen ever\r\nthink of the widow and the fatherless when you, as you say, ‘put in’\r\nyour friends on such occasions?”\r\n\r\nThis little lady was by general consent the most charming widow\r\nin the world, her brilliant mind, plump person and winsome manner\r\nhaving beguiled no end of confirmed bachelors into forgetting their\r\nresolutions—but without success, for Mrs. March remained Mrs. March\r\nseason after season.\r\n\r\n“Ah, my dear Mrs. March,” protested Allyne the incomprehensible, “what\r\nheresy! Just fancy what a pity it would be if widows and younger sons\r\nand all other picturesque people were to be made commonplace by money.\r\nA widow’s charm lies in her delicious appeal to the protection of all\r\nmen. With a million in the funds, a widow would find no end of chaps\r\nasking her to protect them—and so the charm would be gone. And as for\r\nus younger sons—well, just contrast that solemn ass, my brother the\r\nviscount, and the penniless, the clever, the dashing, the—how shall\r\nI do justice to a thing so lovely as I? No, Sir Nelson, if you ever\r\nput me into any of your vulgar good things, I’ll cut you, by Jove—and\r\nsociety will owe you a grudge for having robbed it of its chief\r\nornament—a younger son who is a very younger son indeed.”\r\n\r\n“I am afraid that Mr. Allyne’s philosophy is too deep for me,” laughed\r\nMrs. Fair, and Travers remarked sweetly, “Allyne, you’re an idiot.”\r\n\r\n“But such a blissful idiot,” smilingly went on the very younger son.\r\n“Awfully funny, but nobody can ever deny what I say. We pity Mrs. March,\r\nthe widow, and envy Mrs. Fair, the wife—but, you know, by Jove, I’d\r\nturn it the other way about, don’t you know? No offense, Fair—nothing\r\npersonal. No, my friends, appearances are deceitful. I’ll lay you a\r\nthousand guineas that Fair can’t get what he wants with all his Empire\r\nshares and the rest of it, whereas I have everything I want, besides\r\nseveral elder brothers that I do not want. I have everything I want, I\r\ntell you.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” retorted Mrs. March, “of course you have, since all that you\r\ncare to have is an absurd idea of your own importance.”\r\n\r\n“A hit, a palpable hit!” roared Sir Nelson as they all laughed.\r\n\r\n“Cruel,” protested Allyne. “And to punish you, Mrs. March, I shall ask\r\nMrs. Fair to allow me to take you down to dinner.”\r\n\r\n“I protest,” shouted Sir Nelson with fine gallantry; “I claim her.”\r\n\r\n“Jealous,” sneered Allyne. “Shame! Why, Poynter, your bald spot is as\r\nbig as your brain area—and Lady Poynter here, too. Fie on you!”\r\n\r\n“But Mrs. Fair can’t give Mrs. March any such sentence as placing her\r\nat your mercy, Allyne,” said Travers; “for it is a principle of law\r\nthat it is unlawful to inflict any unusual and cruel punishments.”\r\n\r\n“Well, since you men can’t talk of anything except Mrs. March, I for\r\none am jealous,” cheerily put in Lady Poynter, with her cap bobbing\r\nabout prettily, “and I hope that Mrs. Fair will punish her by making\r\nher listen to Mr. Allyne for two hours.”\r\n\r\n“But, I say, you know,” broke in Sir Poynter, while all the men added\r\ntheir protests to such a disposition of the widow.\r\n\r\n“Just hear them all, will you?” cried Mrs. Fair, lifting her hands. “I\r\nfear, my dear Lady Poynter, that to have a husband is fatal to success.\r\nEvery blessed one of them wants to sit by Mrs. March.”\r\n\r\n“Of course we do,” exclaimed Allyne. “You see, my dear Mrs. Fair, that,\r\nwhile we all love you and dear Lady Poynter, we can’t quite go those\r\nridiculous appendages of yours, to wit., Mr. Fair and Sir Nelson. If\r\nyou could get rid of them, you know—and there are several ways—then\r\nyou would give even the peerless Mrs. March a close run.”\r\n\r\n“Why have you never married?” asked Mrs. March.\r\n\r\n“Can’t, you know—regularly can’t,” replied Allyne, with a woebegone\r\nexpression. “I could never think of marrying anyone but a widow, and,\r\nas I consider widows the only desirable women, it would be against my\r\nprinciples to reduce their number by marrying one of them, you know.”\r\n\r\n“But you might increase their number,” returned Mrs. March spiritedly,\r\n“by marrying a girl and then atoning for the wrong you had done her in\r\nso marrying her by dying at once.”\r\n\r\n“By Jove, do you know, I had never thought of that,” Allyne replied,\r\nadding after a moment of serious consideration, “but, suppose I didn’t\r\ndie, you know? Deucedly uncertain thing, dying. Suicide, of course,\r\nis out of the question in my case, as I am far too unselfish to seek\r\nmy own happiness at the frightful cost of depriving the world of my\r\npresence. And English women are so fastidious that I might find it\r\ndifficult to persuade my wife to shoot—Look, look, Fair—Mrs. Fair is\r\nill.”\r\n\r\nWhile he was rattling along with his stream of nonsense Mrs. Fair, who\r\nwas standing a little behind the rest, swayed forward and would have\r\nfallen had not Allyne’s exclamation called attention to her.\r\n\r\n“Quick, she is faint!” cried Lady Poynter sympathetically.\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Fair almost at once recovered herself, and said: “Pray, don’t\r\nmind. I have these foolish turns at times. They amount to nothing. You\r\nwere saying, Mr. Allyne, that——”\r\n\r\n“Allyne was saying, my dear,” hastily put in Fair to head off Allyne,\r\n“Allyne was saying that English women are so narrow in their views that\r\nthey hesitate to make the idiots of themselves that Englishmen are ever\r\nso ready to do.”\r\n\r\n“I was saying nothing of the sort,” retorted Allyne, in spite of a kick\r\nsurreptitiously administered to him by Travers. “On the contrary, I——”\r\n\r\n“My lady is served,” gravely announced Baxter, pulling aside the\r\nportières and awaiting the forming procession which, to judge from\r\nhis solemn bearing, might have been the funeral cortège of a great\r\npersonage.\r\n\r\n“Come, friends,” smiled Mrs. Fair. “Mrs. March, I will be merciful and\r\nask Mr. Travers to take you down. Sir Nelson, your arm.”\r\n\r\nFair led the way with Lady Poynter, Sir Nelson with his hostess brought\r\nup the rear, while Allyne walked in solitary, philosophical mood, much\r\nas he chose.\r\n\r\n“It’s too bad, Mr. Allyne,” said Mrs. Fair, looking over her shoulder\r\nat him, “but if you will be good, you may have some sweets. Come along.”\r\n\r\n“I appreciate your fine discrimination,” he replied as he executed a\r\nflank movement and placed himself beside her.\r\n\r\nSo they went downstairs chatting and laughing, leaving that gruesome\r\nchest to silence and forgetfulness, and none of them saw the thin, sly\r\nman who smiled as they passed within three feet of his hiding-place in\r\nthe little closet beneath the stairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n\r\nWhile this banter had been passing among the company in the great oak\r\nlibrary below, Miss Mettleby lay on her little white bed where she had\r\nflung herself in a deeper and sterner mood than had ever been hers\r\nbefore. One after another possible explanation of her great knight’s\r\nterrible words presented itself to her mind, only to be rejected.\r\n\r\nFor one quivering moment the thought that if the woman who passed for\r\nMrs. Fair were not, as he had said, his wife, he was free to—but, no,\r\nfor that meant that Maxwell Fair was a scoundrel who could not only\r\nplace a woman in such a nameless position but also desert her when she\r\nhad borne children to him. It was a frightful view from any point—and\r\nyet, at the bottom of her heart she felt that the man who had obtained\r\nsuch a mastery over her soul was not, could not be, so base.\r\n\r\nRacked by this futile effort to see light through the darkness Miss\r\nMettleby started as she heard a tap at her door and the quiet, earnest\r\nvoice of Mrs. Fair asking if she might come in. Her first impulse was\r\nto take this strong, sweet woman, so terribly her fellow-sufferer,\r\ninto her confidence, but before she had called out to her to enter all\r\nsuch mad ideas had flown. Trying to banish all evidence of her recent\r\ntempest of feeling, the governess respectfully begged her mistress to\r\ncome in.\r\n\r\nIt was nothing, Mrs. Fair said, with a great show of forced pleasantry,\r\nbut a little surprise for Mr. Fair—a parcel. Would Miss Mettleby hide\r\nit while they were at dinner, and tell her where she had put it after?\r\nBoth women assured each other that they had not been crying—just a\r\nheadache. And, yes, Miss Mettleby would find a hiding-place for the\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\nSo Mrs. Fair went down to greet her guests, and when she had heard the\r\ncompany go from the library to dinner, Miss Mettleby ran down to that\r\ndeserted room with the big, brown-paper parcel in her hands. She had\r\nat once thought of the old Italian chest as the very place in which to\r\nhide Mr. Fair’s surprise. She peeped into the library to make sure that\r\nher ears had not deceived her. The room was empty, and the girl crept\r\nin.\r\n\r\nFearing that some of the footmen or other servants might enter, she\r\ntook the precaution to draw the portières across the door into the\r\npassage and then hurriedly removed the books and other things that\r\nMr. Fair had placed upon the chest. This done, she was just going to\r\nlift the lid, when she heard a peculiar hissing noise which would have\r\nstartled her at any time and which, with her nerves keyed up, now\r\nfilled her with genuine terror. She turned from the chest and listened.\r\n\r\n             (_To be continued in the April number._)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _A Trust-Buster_\r\n\r\n\r\nCOBWIGGER—By the way, my dear, I haven’t seen anything of the gas bill\r\nthis month.\r\n\r\nMRS.

J. GHENT\r\n\r\n       _Author of “Our Benevolent Feudalism,” “Mass and Class”_\r\n\r\nWe hear much of the butchery of war. Mr. Edward Atkinson and his\r\nfellow-anti-militarists are always opulent with statistics of\r\ncasualties in armed conflicts; and in their violent denunciation of\r\nwarfare are eagerly joined by the various peace societies, the Women’s\r\nChristian Temperance unions and such militant, though ephemeral,\r\nbodies as the Parker Constitutional Clubs. A prominent educator has\r\ncharacterized the Civil War as the Great Killing, and the popular\r\nimagination has been led to look upon it as a carnival of almost\r\nunexampled bloodshed. The militarism of gun and sword is denounced as\r\nthough it were the greatest scourge of the race, and its horrors are\r\npictured in the most lurid colors.\r\n\r\nThe horrors of _industrial_ militarism, on the other hand, claim but\r\nscant attention. Under our present civilization, dominated by the\r\nethics of the trading class, they are, by the overwhelming mass of\r\nthe people, taken as a matter of course. And yet the fiercest and\r\nbloodiest of modern wars—excepting alone the present Russo-Japanese\r\nconflict—result in smaller losses in deaths, maimings and the\r\ninfliction of mortal diseases than are caused by the ordinary\r\nprocesses of the capitalist system of industry. A modern Milton might\r\nappropriately remind us that\r\n\r\n         Peace hath her butcheries no less renowned than war.\r\n\r\nIf the Civil War is to be regarded as the Great Killing, it must be so\r\nregarded only in relation to other wars; for in comparison with\r\ncapitalist industry as it obtains in the United States of America in\r\nthis decade, the Civil War can only rightly be regarded as the Lesser\r\nKilling. It lasted, moreover, for but four years; while the killings\r\nand other casualties of our industrial militarism go on year after\r\nyear in an ever-increasing volume. And as the Civil War eliminated the\r\nphysically best of the race, so does the present system of industry\r\neliminate the physically best. Only it does not stop there, but takes\r\nalso the helpless and the weak.\r\n\r\nLet us see what comparisons of casualties can be made. According to\r\nthe figures in the Adjutant-General’s office, the fatalities in the\r\nNorthern Army during the four years of the Civil War (exclusive of\r\ndeaths from disease) were as follows:\r\n\r\n    Killed in battle       67,058\r\n    Died of wounds         43,012\r\n    Other causes           40,154\r\n                          -------\r\n        Total             150,224\r\n    Yearly average         37,556\r\n\r\nThere were also 199,720 soldiers who died of disease. There are no\r\nmeans of comparing the number of these fatalities with the fatalities\r\nfrom disease contracted in dangerous and unsanitary occupations. It is\r\nprobable that they do not approximate one-tenth of the latter. But,\r\nsince there are no available figures for comparison, they must be\r\nomitted from present consideration.\r\n\r\nThe losses of the Confederates will never be known. The records of\r\ntheir armies were but imperfectly kept, and such as were properly made\r\nwere in many instances lost or destroyed. Even the strength of\r\nthe Confederate armies is a matter about which there has been an\r\nunceasing dispute between Northern and Southern historians since the\r\nCivil War. It is not to be doubted that the Confederates suffered\r\na greater mortality relative to their numerical strength than did\r\nthe Federals, for they were employed to the last available man on\r\nthe firing line, whereas hundreds of thousands of Federals, held as\r\nreserves or stationed as guards, rarely saw the action of battle. In\r\ncertain engagements, moreover, such as the battle of Chickamauga,\r\nthe Confederate losses far exceeded the Federal losses. Assuming the\r\npurely arbitrary figure of 65 per cent. of the Federal fatalities as\r\nrepresenting the fatalities of the Confederates (exclusive of deaths\r\nfrom disease), we have a total of 97,645, or a yearly average of\r\n24,411. Adding the figures for both sides we have an annual average of\r\n62,112 fatalities occurring in a struggle to the death, wherein every\r\ndevice, every energy which men can employ against one another for the\r\ndestruction of life were employed.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to the statistics of industrial fatalities, we find\r\nsomething like the records of the Confederate armies. The figures are\r\nnotoriously, confessedly incomplete, and often so much so as to be\r\nentirely misleading. Even the tables of railroad accidents compiled by\r\nthe Interstate Commerce Commission are known to show totals far below\r\nthe actual casualties. A writer in the New York _Herald_ for December\r\n4, 1904, has analyzed some of these tables and pointed out their\r\ndefects. But, defective as they are, they furnish an approximate basis\r\nfor comparisons with some of the sanguinary conflicts of the Civil War.\r\nThe killings on interstate roads for the year ended June 30, 1904, are\r\nreported at 9,984; the woundings at 78,247. The State roads probably\r\nadded about 975 killings and 7,500 woundings. To these may be added the\r\ncasualties on the trolley lines, approximately 1,340 killed and 52,169\r\nwounded. We have thus a basis for comparison with the losses at\r\nGettysburg, Chancellorsville and Chickamauga:\r\n\r\n    _Losses in Three Battles (both sides), 1863_\r\n\r\n                          Killed   Wounded\r\n    Gettysburg             5,662    27,203\r\n    Chickamauga            3,924    23,362\r\n    Chancellorsville       3,271    18,843\r\n                          ------    ------\r\n                          12,857    69,408\r\n\r\n    _Losses in Railroad Accidents, 1904_\r\n\r\n                          Killed   Wounded\r\n    Interstate roads       9,984    78,247\r\n    State roads             *975     7,500\r\n    Trolley lines         *1,340    52,169\r\n                          ------   -------\r\n                          12,299   137,916\r\n    *Estimated.\r\n\r\nThe factories probably destroy more lives than do the railroads.

For the coal mines, on the other hand, we\r\nhave something like authentic figures. The United States Geological\r\nSurvey reports the casualties in mining coal for the year 1901 as\r\n1,467 killed and 3,643 wounded. Except for the low ratio of wounded\r\nto killed, this would make a fair comparison with any one of a number\r\nof important engagements during the Civil War.

On a basis of\r\n80,000,000 population this would mean a yearly loss of from 77,040 to\r\n80,240 lives. Mr. Frederick L. Hoffman, of the Prudential Insurance\r\nCompany, in a letter printed in Mr. Robert Hunter’s recent volume,\r\n“Poverty,” estimates the rate as between 80 and 85 per 100,000. This\r\nwould mean from 64,000 to 68,000 killings. “If we say that twenty-five\r\nare injured to every one killed, and consider ... the fatal accident\r\nrate to be 80 in every 100,000, we have it that 1,664,000 persons\r\nare annually killed or more or less seriously injured in the United\r\nStates. If all minor accidents were taken into consideration, it is\r\nprobable that the ratio of non-fatal accidents to fatal accidents would\r\nbe nearly 100 to 1.” This would mean approximately 4,800,000 minor\r\nwoundings every year.\r\n\r\nWe cannot separate, on the basis of present figures, the fatal\r\naccidents which would be inevitable under any form of society and those\r\nwhich are consequent upon the present capitalist system of production,\r\nwith its brutal indifference to life. We can only estimate. We have,\r\nfor instance, in the census reports, an entry of “burns and scalds,”\r\nbut nothing about boiler explosions; we have a certain number of\r\ndeaths from drowning, but we are not told whether they occurred in\r\nfrightful disasters like mine floods or the destruction of a _General\r\nSlocum_—for which capitalist industry is solely responsible—or\r\nin accidents wherein the individual’s whim or caprice alone was\r\nresponsible. And finally we have an appalling record of suicides; but\r\nin how many of these business troubles or other economic causes were\r\nthe impelling motives for self-destruction we cannot tell.\r\n\r\nWhat we do know is that the overwhelming number of the fatalities\r\nthat all of us learn of, instance by instance, are due to economic\r\ncauses; that railroad, factory and mining accidents are for the most\r\npart needless, and due almost entirely to the brutal indifference of\r\ncapital to the lives of the workers, and that far the greater number of\r\nsuicides of which we read or hear are of beings who have been sent to\r\ndeath through economic troubles. Under the benign reign of capitalist\r\nindustry we have a yearly list of fatalities somewhere between 64,000\r\nand 80,240 and of serious maimings of 1,600,000, whereas two great\r\narmies, employing all the enginery of warfare, could succeed in\r\nslaughtering only 62,112 human beings yearly.\r\n\r\nIt is time we heard less of the butchery of war; time we heard more\r\nof the butchery of peace. And yet it is doubtful if we shall hear a\r\ndifferent strain from those now most prominently before the public as\r\nadvocates of peace. The advocacy of peace, in so far as it emanates\r\nfrom the retainers and other beneficiaries of the capitalist class, is\r\nbased not so much upon humanitarian grounds as upon the ground that the\r\nworker is serving a more useful purpose when mangled in the Holy War\r\nof Trade than when slaughtered in armed conflict. It is the waste of\r\nprofits on human labor, rather than the waste of life, that most deeply\r\naffects them. They are not always conscious of this, because they\r\ninstinctively identify their moral notions with the material interests\r\nof the class they serve. But an unconscious or subconscious motive may\r\nbe the most powerful of impulses to speech and action. And thus there\r\nis every reason to believe that we shall continue to hear the horrors\r\nof war most loudly denounced by the very ones who keep most silent\r\nregarding the horrors of industrial “peace.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is curious how fond men grow of each other when they are making money\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _Remembered_\r\n\r\n\r\n                        BY ELLA WHEELER WILCOX\r\n\r\n    His art was loving.

Other admirals have\r\nattacked fortified strongholds before Togo was heard of. Other admirals\r\nhave striven for the command of the sea before Alexieff blundered into\r\na war for which he was not ready. I record the capable strenuousness of\r\nAdmiral Guldberg, who strove to defend a country not his own, and did\r\nthe best he could with the materials provided him.\r\n\r\nAjax defied the lightning, and Guldberg defied the French, possessors\r\nof the second most powerful navy afloat. Therefore three cheers for old\r\nGuldberg and more power to his elbow.\r\n\r\nA dozen years ago, when Siam resolved to take its place among the\r\ngreat nations of the earth, that country imported from Europe certain\r\nmen who were supposed to know how to do things. An Englishman from\r\nOxford endeavored to evolve a school system; a German from Krupp’s\r\nestablishment was made head of the Royal railway department, although\r\nthere were no railways at that time in the country to look after;\r\nstill, as there was no education either, he started fair with the\r\nEnglishman. Another German looked after telegraphs, and he also had a\r\nclean slate to begin on. The reconstruction of the army and navy was\r\nintrusted to the care of a pair of Danes, notable fighters of yore and\r\nmaster mariners, as all the world knows. Commodore de Richelieu had\r\nbeen a Danish officer, and it would have astonished the cardinal of\r\nthat name to have seen him fighting against the French. De Richelieu\r\nhad charge of the forts, and the training of the men to defend them.\r\nAdmiral Guldberg commanded the fleet, and endeavored with indifferent\r\nsuccess to teach the Siamese something about navigation.\r\n\r\nIn 1893, while these useful Danes were endeavoring to put some backbone\r\ninto Siamese incompetency, the diplomatic services of France and Siam\r\nbegan sending picture post-cards to each other. Diplomacy is invariably\r\npolite, but when it takes a hand in the game, prepare for squalls.\r\nAlthough I have the Blue-books before me relating to this tragic\r\noccurrence, I am quite unable to determine the rights of the case.\r\nProbably France and Siam were both in the wrong, but be that as it may,\r\nFrance persisted in her intention, little dreaming that right round the\r\nbend of the river Admiral Guldberg was waiting for her. The rights and\r\nwrongs in these affairs depend a great deal on the power of the other\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nI imagine if France wished to send two gunboats up the Hudson River,\r\nand the President of the United States ordered the war vessels to\r\nproceed no further than New York Bay, France might perhaps have\r\nconsidered herself in the wrong, and the war vessels would not have\r\nproceeded; but as the other party in the case under consideration was\r\nmerely the helpless kingdom of Siam, it is a historical fact that the\r\ntwo members of the French fleet, _Inconstant_ and _Comète_, crossed the\r\nRubicon; in other words, the bar—and entered the River Me-nam against\r\nthe current and the wishes of His Majesty of Siam; and this took place\r\non that unlucky day, the thirteenth of July, 1893.\r\n\r\nPaknam was the Port Arthur in this instance. It lies three miles from\r\nthe mouth of the river and thirty miles by water south of the capital,\r\nBangkok, although on the opposite bank of the stream a railway sixteen\r\nmiles in length runs into the capital. At Paknam everything was\r\nprepared for a desperate resistance. The forts were well manned and the\r\ncannon were loaded. Commodore de Richelieu was in command, glad that\r\ndiplomacy had broken down, as it usually does, and that now military\r\nrenown was to be his. The Siamese soldiers have one defect: they\r\nbelieve in the couplet that “he who fights and runs away will live to\r\nfight another day.” Indeed, they better the lines, and run away before\r\neven showing fight. Thus, in all the wars Siam has engaged in she has\r\nnever lost a man, just as if she were the Cunard line of steamers.\r\n\r\nWhen the Siamese soldiers realized that their gallant Commodore was\r\nactually going to fire off the guns, they unanimously got over the\r\ngarden wall with a celerity that amazed the man from Denmark. Nothing\r\ndaunted, the resolute de Richelieu held the fort, and himself fired off\r\nthe guns one after another. When this cannonade had been accomplished\r\nhe was helpless, for he could not reload without assistance, so he got\r\nhimself into a steam launch, sailed across the river and took train to\r\nBangkok.\r\n\r\nAuthorities differ as to the result of the Commodore’s cannon fire. One\r\nsays that several Frenchmen were killed and wounded, another that no\r\nharm was done. So far as I am aware the French gunboat made no reply,\r\nbut steamed majestically up the river, while their enemy was steaming\r\nwith equal majesty on a special engine over the rocky road to Bangkok.\r\n\r\nWhile the French fleet was proceeding toward a peril of which they had\r\nnot the slightest suspicion, we have time to consider the equipment of\r\nAdmiral Guldberg, who will not be so easily got rid of as his\r\ncountryman, the Commodore.\r\n\r\nThree years before there had been built at Hong Kong a steam yacht for\r\nHis Excellency the Governor of the Philippines, which at that time\r\nwas under Spanish rule. When the yacht was finished the Governor of\r\ncourse wanted it, but wished to pay on the instalment plan, whereas\r\nthe builders said they were not engaged in the three years’ hire\r\nsystem business, and having some acquaintance with Spanish financial\r\narrangements, they declined to deliver the goods except on a basis\r\nof cash down. Such a hard money determination was enough to knock\r\nthe bottom out of any negotiation with a Spanish official, so the\r\nGovernor folded his toga proudly about him, and in the purest Castilian\r\npractically repeated the words of the old song to the effect that the\r\nyacht might go to Hong Kong for him, which it did not need to do, being\r\nthere already. So in Hong Kong it remained, until in ’91 an emissary of\r\nthe Siamese Government bought it, and took it round to Bangkok.\r\n\r\nThe Siamese armed this terrific vessel with old muzzle-loading cannons\r\nthat had hitherto occupied the position of corner posts of various\r\ncompounds about the capital. The boat had been intended for pleasure\r\nand not for war, so there were no portholes for the muzzles of the\r\nguns. This difficulty was got over by building a low deck-house the\r\nlength of the vessel, and placing the cannon athwart this structure,\r\none pointing to port, another to starboard, another to port, another\r\nto starboard, and so on, the ordnance being chained down, or roped or\r\ntied with string, so that it would not cause the yacht to tumble a\r\nsomersault when fired. The arrangement had the advantage of economy, as\r\nno gun-carriages were needed, and as the cannon could be loaded from\r\nthe deck. But there was also the drawback, which perhaps would have\r\nbeen felt more in any other navy than that of Siam, which consisted of\r\nthe fact that you could not aim the cannon at anything in particular.\r\nStill, a gunner might have much enjoyment in shooting at the landscape\r\nin general. A British naval officer of large experience stated\r\nsolemnly that he never understood the horrors of warfare until he saw\r\nthis vessel. The arrangement of the cannon made the craft somewhat\r\ntop-heavy, and so the authorities wisely ordained that she was never to\r\nput to sea where the waves might upset the apple cart.\r\n\r\nAs if the cannon were not enough, her name was one likely to strike\r\nterror into the heart of the stoutest enemy. She was called the _Makut\r\nRajakumar_, and she was listed in the naval annals of Siam as a small\r\ncruiser. This sea-dog of war was the flagship of Admiral Guldberg,\r\ncommanded and captained by the Dane himself, with a full crew of\r\ntwenty-seven fighting Siamese, not to mention two engineers and four\r\nstokers.\r\n\r\nThe French pretend that two vessels opposed the coming of their two\r\nwarships, and while this is technically true, it is not actually so,\r\nand as the statement tends to detract from the undoubted bravery of\r\nAdmiral Guldberg, it may as well be stated that the second vessel was\r\na small steam scow which carried only one gun, whose muzzle projected\r\noverboard where the bowsprit is on a sailing vessel, and because\r\nthe gun was stationary there, chained there as were those on the\r\n_Makut Rajakumar_, it could be loaded only when the scow was moored\r\nto a wharf. This barge was commanded by Captain Schmieglow. His crew\r\ndeserted him in a body before she left the wharf, and as the good\r\nCaptain did not understand the engine he contented himself with firing\r\nthe cannon down the river, which concussion so dislocated the machinery\r\nthat the scow ran her nozzle agin’ the bank of the opposite shore, and\r\nthere the Captain was helpless. So his Admiral had to fight the battle\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nAgain French historians maintain that their warships never fired a shot\r\nat the floating lunatic asylum which assailed them, and it is also\r\nstated that the Admiral’s cannon balls never touched them. That may all\r\nbe true enough, but it in no way interferes with my assertion that\r\nAdmiral Guldberg did the very best he could with the material in hand,\r\nand that he put up one of the finest fights ever recorded in the\r\nhistory of the sea.\r\n\r\nAnd now we come to the battle, and as the French had a certain hand\r\nin it, the stirring lines of French Canada’s poet, Dr. Drummond, may\r\nfittingly be quoted to open the strife.\r\n\r\n    One dark night on Lake St. Pierre,\r\n      The wind she blow, blow, blow;\r\n    And the crew of the wood scow _Julia Plante_\r\n      Got scared and ran below.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate occurrence which ultimately wrecked the _Julia Plante_\r\nhappened also on board the _Makut Rajakumar_. The moment the French war\r\nvessels appeared the entire crew of the Siamese cruiser dived below,\r\nbewailing their lot, and leaving Admiral Guldberg alone on deck. The\r\nhelmsman deserted the wheel, and the engineer his engine. The French\r\nfleet was still some distance to the southward, so the Admiral rushed\r\nafter his craven crew, and kicked most of them aloft again, wild Danish\r\noaths from his lips keeping time to the energetic swaying of his foot,\r\ncommanding them to stand by the guns. It was no use; with a yell of\r\nterror they again descended, falling over each other down into the\r\nhold. The Admiral ran to the wheel, swerved his vessel; then let go the\r\nspokes, seized a lighted torch, and fired the port side cannons one\r\nafter another. Back he dashed to the wheel again, turned his boat up\r\nthe river, for the Frenchmen were now passing him, fled again to the\r\nunfired guns and gave the French the second broadside.\r\n\r\nNow, to his horror, he saw that the French ships, better engined than\r\nhis own, were leaving him without firing a shot, and from the prow he\r\nshook his fist at them, daring them to stand up to him, but neither the\r\nmouth of man nor the mouth of cannon made answer.\r\n\r\nFlinging his cocked hat to the deck, and tossing his laced coat on top\r\nof it, rolling up his sleeves and seizing the rammer, he swabbed out\r\nthe old cannon, and reloaded, while the decrepit engine, unattended,\r\njogged away up the river after the rapidly disappearing French\r\nwarships. That task accomplished, he cast his eye ahead and saw the\r\nriver was clear, so sprang down into the stokehold, and sent a few\r\nshovelfuls of coal under the boiler, then came on deck again wiping\r\nhis perspiring brow. By this time the French boats were quite out of\r\ngunshot, and the only consolation left for the courageous Dane was that\r\nat least he was chasing them.\r\n\r\nAt this most inopportune moment there arose a galling and Gallic laugh\r\nfrom a coasting schooner lying at anchor in the river. It is never\r\nadvisable to laugh at an exasperated man, as these hilarious mariners\r\nwere soon to learn. Slow as the _Makut_ was she could certainly\r\noutstrip a small French coasting vessel at anchor. The angry Admiral\r\nturned his red face toward the Sound, and saw before him the _J. B.\r\nSay_, a French trading craft, tauntingly flying the tricolor at the\r\nmasthead. The infuriated Admiral remembered that his adopted country was\r\nat war with this hated emblem, so he roared across the muddy waters:\r\n\r\n“Haul down that flag and surrender!”\r\n\r\nThe crew replied with the French equivalent of “Go to thunder!” which\r\nthe Admiral at once proceeded to obey. He ran to the wheel, steered his\r\nsteamer in a semicircle, headed her down the river and sprang to the\r\nguns. Thunder spoke out the first cannon, and missed. Thunder again the\r\nsecond, with an after crash of woodwork, the ball carrying away part of\r\nthe bulwarks.\r\n\r\n“Stop it, you madman!” shrieked the crew.\r\n\r\n“Surrender!” roared the Admiral, but they were now working madly at the\r\nwindlass, trying to hoist the anchor. The _Makut Rajakumar_ had passed\r\nthe boat, and now the Admiral took to the wheel again, swooped around,\r\nand came on with his other battery. The first shot struck fair in the\r\nprow, and the second, to the consternation of the Frenchmen, hit just\r\nat the waterline, tearing a fatal hole in the timber. The third shot\r\nwent wide, and the Admiral allowed his steamer to forge ahead while he\r\nswabbed out the guns and reloaded them.\r\n\r\nBy the time this was finished and he had turned round again the _J. B.\r\nSay_ was under way, but with a dangerous list to one side. The steamer\r\nspeedily overtook her, and crash! crash! went the guns again, and once\r\nmore she was struck in a tender place, which was quite unnecessary, for\r\nthe craft was palpably sinking, in spite of the efforts of four men at\r\nthe pumps.\r\n\r\nAt last the heated Admiral ceased fire, for the Frenchmen, taking\r\nto the longboat, had abandoned their vessel, and were rowing for\r\nthe shore. The _J. B. Say_ with a wobble or two settled down and\r\ndisappeared beneath the surface of the muddy Me-nam. Admiral Guldberg\r\ndescended to the engine-room, stopped the engines, and kicked the\r\nengineer into some sense of his duties aboard the cruiser. He informed\r\nhis huddled naval brigade, who were scared almost white by the firing,\r\nthat the Battle of Paknam had ended gloriously for the Siamese flag,\r\nafter which announcement he urged them on deck by means of boot and\r\nfist. As there was nothing visible to frighten the crew, the Admiral\r\nhimself being the only object of terror in the neighborhood, discipline\r\nonce more resumed its sway. The engineer responded to the tinkle of the\r\nbell, and the cruiser _Makut Rajakumar_ began pounding its way up to\r\nthe capital, pausing only to capture the French flag which fluttered\r\nfrom the masthead of the sunken _J. B. Say_.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Guldberg steamed in triumph to Bangkok, but had to take the\r\nwheel himself when the town was sighted, for the moment his crew caught\r\na glimpse of the French cruiser floating peacefully in front of the\r\nembassy, they promptly went below again, as was the custom of Sir\r\nJoseph Porter when the breezes began to blow.\r\n\r\nIt would be joyful to add that Admiral Guldberg received the\r\nrecognition he deserved, but it is hardly necessary to state that\r\nsuch was not the fact. The Siamese Government apologized abjectly for\r\ntheir Admiral and his action. They said he had fired without orders.\r\nThe Minister of Foreign Affairs congratulated the commander of the\r\nFrench ship _Inconstant_ on his boldness and daring in forcing a way\r\nto Bangkok. The owners of the _J. B. Say_ were lavishly compensated.\r\nAdmiral Guldberg was degraded to plain captain, and the government had\r\nlittle difficulty in proving that no Siamese obstructed the advance of\r\nthe French, which statement was true enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _A Sociological Fable_\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was trouble in the Poultry yard; things were Changed from the\r\nway they had been, so that it was becoming Hard for some of the Fowls\r\nto get a Sufficiency of Food. Just as much Corn was being Scattered\r\nby the Farmer’s Wife as formerly, but some Knowing Cocks had built\r\nWide-mouthed Funnels over the Heads of the other Fowls, so that much of\r\nthe Supply that was intended for the Whole Community was diverted to the\r\nKnowing Cocks and their Broods.\r\n\r\nThere was much Discontent because of the Scarcity of Food and many\r\nwere the Plans that were Broached to remedy the Situation. “See!” said\r\na Great Goose, pointing to the Supplies that lay beneath the Funnels\r\nof the Knowing Cocks, “how unjust it is that some should have so much\r\nand others so little. The Knowing Cocks and their Broods can never use\r\nup their supply, while I and my Green Goslings go Hungry. Can nothing\r\nbe done to help me?” he squawked, raising his Unseemly Voice in order\r\nto attract general attention. “Can nothing be done for me and for my\r\nfamily?”\r\n\r\nAt this many Quacks began to be heard. One said that the Supplies of\r\nthe Knowing Cocks ought to be Seized and Distributed equally in the\r\nCommunity; another said that the Knowing Cocks ought to be Forced to\r\nExchange their Corn with the other Fowls, in the Proportion of Sixteen\r\nGrains of that Held by the Knowing Cocks to each grain belonging to the\r\nother Fowls. And another insisted that the Only way to Right the Wrong\r\nwas to Compel the Knowing Cocks to Contribute to a Common Fund a large\r\nPart of the Excess that Reached them through their Funnels.\r\n\r\nBut at last a Sage Hen, that had somehow found her way into the\r\nCommunity, succeeded in Making herself Heard: “Of what use is it,”\r\nshe Cried, “to ask how Many Pounds of Cure are needed, when one Ounce\r\nof Prevention will Suffice? Let us Go to the Fountain Head of the\r\nWrong,” she continued, Pointing to the Funnels. “As long as Some of\r\nthe Community are Allowed to be in Possession of Undue Opportunities,\r\nEvil must happen to the others. Take the Funnels away from the Knowing\r\nCocks!”\r\n\r\nNo sooner said than Done. The Funnels were Seized and Destroyed; and\r\nthereafter the Corn that fell from the Hand of the Farmer’s Wife was\r\nEquitably distributed in the Community.\r\n\r\n                  MORAL\r\n\r\n    If on the road a traveler lies\r\n    Fast bound—and you should see him—\r\n    Don’t take his head upon your lap\r\n    And give him medicine and pap,\r\n    But cut his cords and free him.\r\n\r\n                       F.

B. MARRIOTT-WATSON\r\n\r\n’Twas two o’clock of a bright wild March day that I cleared St.\r\nLeonard’s Forest, and came out upon the roads at the back of Horsham.\r\nI was for Reading, but chose that way by reason of the better security\r\nit promised, which, as it chanced, was a significant piece of irony.\r\nHorsham, a mighty quiet, pretty town, lay in a blaze of the sun,\r\nenduring the sallies of a dusty wind, and, feeling hot and athirst\r\nafter my long ride, I pulled up at an inn and dismounted.\r\n\r\n“Host,” says I, when I was come it; “a pint of your best Burgundy or\r\nCanary to wash this dust adown; and rip me if I will not have it laced\r\nwith brandy.”\r\n\r\n“Why, sir,” says he, “a cold bright day for horseback,” and shakes his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n“Damme, you’re right,” says I. “Cold i’ the belly and hot in the groin.\r\nHere’s luck to the house, man,” and I tossed off the gallipot. “Why,\r\ngoodman, ye’ll make your fortune on this,” I said with a derisive\r\nlaugh, and flung open the door, to go out; when all of a sudden I came\r\nto silence and a pause.\r\n\r\n“’Tis the officers,” says the landlord, who was at my ear. “Gadslife,\r\n’tis the sheriff’s men from Lewes.”\r\n\r\n“Lewes!” says I slowly; “what be they here for?”\r\n\r\n“Why,” says he in a flutter, “there was him that was taken for a\r\ntobyman by Guilford. He was tried at Lewes, and will hang.”\r\n\r\n“If he be fool enough to be taken, let him be hanged and be damned,”\r\nsays I carelessly.\r\n\r\nWhen I was got upon my horse I began to go at a walk down the High\r\nstreet, for though, as was according to nature, I was inquisitive\r\nabout the matter, I was too wary to adventure ere I was sure of my\r\nground. And this denial of unnecessary hazards, as is my custom, saved\r\nme from a mishap; for as the procession wound along, the traps and\r\nthe carriage between ’em, there was one of them that turned his head\r\naside to give an order, and, rip me if ’twas not that muckworm, traitor\r\nand canter, the thief-taker, Timothy Grubbe. I had an old score with\r\nTimothy, the which I had sworn to pay; but that was not the time nor\r\nthe opportunity, and so I pulled in and lowered my head, lest by chance\r\nhis evil eye might go my way. As I did so, something struck on the\r\nmare’s rump, and, looking back, I saw a young man on horseback that had\r\nemerged from a side street.\r\n\r\n“Whoa, there,” says I cheerfully. “Are you so blinded by March dust as\r\nnot to see a gentleman when he goes by?”\r\n\r\nHe was a slight, handsome-looking youth, of a frank face but of a\r\nrustic appearance, and he stammered out an apology.\r\n\r\n“Why, I did but jest,” I said heartily. “Think no more on’t,\r\nparticularly as ’twas my fault to have checked the mare of a sudden.\r\nBut to say the truth I was gaping at the grand folks yonder.”\r\n\r\nHe stared, after the traps and says he in an interested voice: “Who be\r\nthey? Is it my Lord Blackdown?”\r\n\r\nNow this comparison of that wry-necked, pock-faced villain Grubbe to a\r\nperson of quality tickled me, but I answered, keeping a straight face.\r\n\r\n“Well, not exactly,” says I, “not my lord, but another that should\r\nstand or hang as high maybe, and shall some day.”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” says he, gazing at me, “a friend of yours, sir?”\r\n\r\nHe was a ruddy color, and his mouth was habitually a little open,\r\ngiving him an expression of perpetual wonder and innocence; so that,\r\nbless you, I knew him at once for what he was at heart—a simple fellow\r\nof a natural kindliness and one of no experience in the world, and a\r\npretty dull wit.\r\n\r\n“Not as you might call him, a friend,” said I gravely, “but rather one\r\nthat has put an affront upon me.”\r\n\r\n“You should wipe it out, sir,” says this innocent seriously. “I would\r\nallow no man to put an affront on me, gad, I would not!”\r\n\r\n“Why,” said I drily, “I bide my time, being, if I may say so, of less\r\nmustard and pepper than yourself. Nevertheless it shall be wiped out to\r\nthe last stain.”\r\n\r\n“Gad, I like that spirit,” says he briskly, and, as if it constituted\r\na bond betwixt us, he began to amble slowly at my side. “If there is\r\nany mischief, sir,” says he, “I trust you will allow me to stand your\r\nfriend.”\r\n\r\nHere was innocence indeed, yet I could ha’ clapped him on the back for\r\na buck of good-fellowship and friendliness, and, relaxing my tone, I\r\nturned the talk on himself.\r\n\r\n“You are for a journey?” says I.\r\n\r\nHe nodded, and his color rose, but he frowned. “I am for Effingham,” he\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\n“So am I,” said I, “at least I pass that way,” which was not so, for\r\nI was for Reading, and had meant to go by Guilford. Yet I was in no\r\nmind to risk an encounter with Grubbe and his lambs, who were bound for\r\nGuilford if what the innkeeper said was true; and the way by Effingham\r\nwould serve me as well as another.\r\n\r\nHe looked pleased, and says he: “Why, we will travel in company.”\r\n\r\n“With all my heart!”\r\n\r\nThe traps had disappeared upon the Guilford road in a mist of dust, and\r\nwe jogged on comfortably till we came to cross-roads, where we turned\r\naway for Slinfold, reaching that village near by two of the clock.\r\nHere my companion must slake his thirst, and I was nothing loath. He\r\nhad a gentlemanly air about him for all his rustic habit, and very\r\npleasantly, if with some awkwardness, offered me of a bottle.\r\n\r\n“You mind me,” said I, drinking to him, for I liked the fellow, “of a\r\nlad that I knew that was in the wars.”\r\n\r\n“Was you in the wars?” asks he eagerly.\r\n\r\nI had meant the wars of the road, which, indeed, are as perilous and as\r\nventuresome as the high quarrels of ravening nations.\r\n\r\n“I served in Flanders,” said I.\r\n\r\n“My father fought for His Gracious Majesty Charles I,” says he quickly,\r\n“and took a deep wound at Marston Moor. There was never a braver man\r\nthan Squire Masters of Rockham.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll warrant his son is like him,” said I.\r\n\r\nHe bowed as if he were at Court. “Your servant, sir,” says he, smiling\r\nwell pleased, and eyed me. “You have seen some service, sir?”\r\n\r\n“Why, as much as will serve, Mr. Masters.”\r\n\r\nHe looked at me shyly. “You have my name, now?” said he, and left his\r\nquestion in the air.\r\n\r\n“You may call me Ryder,” said I.\r\n\r\n“You have had your company?” he went on in a hesitating voice.\r\n\r\n“Not always as good company as this,” I replied, laughing.\r\n\r\n“I knew it,” he said eagerly; “you are Captain Ryder?”\r\n\r\n“There have been those that have put that style on me,” I answered,\r\namused at his persistence.\r\n\r\n“I am glad that I have met you, Captain,” said this young fool, and put\r\nhis arm in mine quite affectionately.\r\n\r\n“I have been unhappily kept much at home, and have seen less than I\r\nmight of things beyond the hills. Not but what Sussex is a fine shire,”\r\nhe adds, with a sigh.\r\n\r\n“Why, it is fine if so be your home be there,” I replied.\r\n\r\n“My home is there,” he said, and paused, and again the frown wrinkled\r\nup his brow.\r\n\r\nHe said no more till we were in the saddle again and had gone some half\r\na mile, and then he spoke, and I knew his poor brain had been playing\r\npitch and toss with some thought.\r\n\r\n“Captain Ryder,” he said abruptly, “you have traveled far and seen\r\nmuch. You might advise one junior to you on a matter of worldly wisdom.”\r\n\r\nSink me, thinks I, what’s the boy after? But, says I gravely, from a\r\nmutinous face: “You can hang your faith on me for an opinion or a blow,\r\nMr. Masters.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” says he heartily, and then thrust a hand into his\r\nbosom and rapidly stuck at me a document. “Read that, sir,” said he\r\nimpulsively.\r\n\r\nI opened it, and found ’twas writ in a woman’s hand, and subscribed\r\nAnne Varley; and the marrow of it was fond affection.\r\n\r\nWhy, ’twas but a common love billet he had given me, of the which I\r\nhave seen dozens and received very many—some from persons of quality\r\nthat would astonish you. But what had I to do with this honest ninny\r\nand his mistress? I had no nose for it, and so said I, handing him back\r\nhis letter.\r\n\r\n“It has a sweet smack and ’tis pretty enough inditing.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” says he quickly, “’tis her nature, Captain. ’Tis her heart that\r\nspeaks. Yet is she denied by her parents. They will have none of me.”\r\n\r\n“The more to their shame,” I said.\r\n\r\n“They aspire high,” says he, “as Anne’s beauty and virtues of\r\nthemselves would justify. Yet she does love me, and I her, and we are\r\nof one spirit and heart. See you how she loves me, poor thing, poor\r\nsilly puss! And they would persuade her to renunciation. But she shall\r\nnot—she shall not; I swear it!” he cried in excitement. “She shall be\r\nfree to choose where she will.”\r\n\r\n“Spoke like a man of temper,” said I approvingly. “You will go win her\r\nforthright.”\r\n\r\n“I am on my journey to accomplish that now,” says he. “She has writ\r\nin this letter, as you have seen, that her father dissuades her, and\r\nshe sighs her renunciation, adding sweet words of comfort that her\r\naffection will not die—no, never, never, and that she will die virgin\r\nfor me. Say you not, sir, that this is beautiful conduct, and, am I not\r\nright to ride forth and seize her from her unnatural parents, to make\r\nher mine?”\r\n\r\n“Young gentleman,” said I, being stirred by his honest sincerity and\r\nhis bubbling over, “were you brother to me, or I to Mistress Anne, you\r\nshould have my blessing.”\r\n\r\nAt that he glowed, and his spirits having risen with this\r\ncommunication, he babbled on the road of many things cheerfully,\r\nbut mostly of love and beauty, and the virtues of Mistress Anne of\r\nEffingham Manor.\r\n\r\nI will confess that after a time his prattle wearied me; ’twas too much\r\nhoney and cloyed my palate. If he had known as much of the sex as has\r\nfallen to my lot he would have taken another stand, and sung in a lower\r\nkey.\r\n\r\nWell, ’twas late in the afternoon when we reached the hills beyond\r\nEwhurst, and began to climb the rugged way to the top. The wind had\r\ngone down with the sun in a flurry of gold in the west, to which that\r\neastern breeze had beat all day; and over the head of Pitch Hill last\r\nyear’s heather still blazed in its decay.\r\n\r\nWhen we had got to the Windmill Inn, that lies packed into the side of\r\nthe wooded hill, we descended for refreshment, and I saw the horses\r\nstalled below for baiting. Now that house, little and quiet, perches\r\nin a lonely way in the pass of the hill, and upon one side the ground\r\nfalls so fast away that the eye carries over a precipitous descent\r\ntoward the weald of Surrey and the dim hills by the sea. And this view\r\nwas fading swiftly in the window under a bleak sky as Masters and I\r\nate of our dinner in the upstairs room that looked upon it. He had a\r\nnatural grace of mind despite the rawness of his behavior, and his\r\nsentiments emerged sometimes in a gush, as when, says he, looking at\r\nthe darkening weald:\r\n\r\n“I love it, Captain. ’Tis mine. My home is there, and, God willing,\r\nAnne’s too shall be.”\r\n\r\n“Amen!” said I heartily, for the boy had gone to my heart, absurd\r\nthough he was.\r\n\r\nAnd just on that there was a noise without the door, the clank of heavy\r\nfeet rang on the boards, and Timothy Grubbe’s ugly mask disfigured the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nHe came forward a little with a grin on his distorted features, and,\r\nlooking from one to the other of us, said he:\r\n\r\n“My respects, Captain, and to this young plover that no doubt ye’re\r\nplucking. By the Lord, Dick Ryder, but I had given you up. Heaven sends\r\nus good fortune when we’re least thinking of it.”\r\n\r\nMasters, at his word, had started up. “Who are you, sir, that intrudes\r\non two gentlemen?” he demanded with spirit. “I’ll have you know this is\r\na private room. Get you gone!”\r\n\r\n“Softly, man,” says Grubbe, in an insinuating voice. “Maybe I’m wrong\r\nand you’re two of a color. Is it an apprentice, Dick, this brave lad\r\nthat talks so bold and has such fine feathers?”\r\n\r\n“If you do not quit,” said I shortly, “I will spit your beauty for you\r\nin two ticks.”\r\n\r\n“Dick Ryder had always plenty of heart,” said he in his jeering way.\r\n“Dick had always a famous wit, and was known as a hospitable host. So I\r\nwill take the liberty to invite to his sociable board some good fellows\r\nthat are below, to make merry. We shall prove an excellent company,\r\nI’ll warrant.”\r\n\r\nMasters took a step toward him.\r\n\r\n“Now, who the devil soever you may be, you shall not use gentlemen so,”\r\nhe cried, whipping out his blade.\r\n\r\nBut Grubbe turned on him satirically. “As for you, young cockchafer,”\r\nsaid he, “it bodes no good to find you in this company. But as you seem\r\nsimpleton enough, I’ll give you five minutes to take your leave of\r\nthis gentleman of the road. Dick, you’re a fine tobyman, and you have\r\nenjoyed a brave career, but, damme, your hour is struck.”\r\n\r\nI rose, but, ere I could get to him, young Masters had fallen on him.\r\n\r\n“Defend yourself, damn ye,” he said, “you that insult a gentleman that\r\nis my friend! Put up your blade!” and he made at him with incredible\r\nenergy.\r\n\r\nUttering a curse Grubbe thrust out his point and took the first onrush,\r\nswerving it aside; and ere I could intervene they were at it.\r\n\r\nMy young friend was impetuous, and as I saw at once, none too skilful;\r\nand Grubbe kept his temper, as he always did. He stood with a thin,\r\nugly smile pushing aside his opponent’s blade for a moment or two,\r\nuntil, of a sudden, he drew himself up and let drive very low and under\r\nthe other’s guard. The sword rattled from Masters’s hand, and he went\r\ndown on the floor. I uttered an oath.\r\n\r\n“By God, for this shall you die, you swine!” said I fiercely; and I ran\r\nat him; but, being by the door, he swept it open with a movement and\r\nbacked into the passage.\r\n\r\n“The boot is on t’other leg, Dick,” says he maliciously. “’Tis you are\r\ndoomed!” and closing the door behind him he whistled shrilly.\r\n\r\nI knew what he intended, and that his men were there, but I stooped\r\nover the boy’s body and held my fingers to his heart. ’Twas dead and\r\nstill. I cursed Grubbe and started up. If I was not to be taken there\r\nwas only the window, looking on the deeps of the descending valley. I\r\nthrew back the casement and leaped over the sill. Grubbe should perish,\r\nI swore, and I doubled now my oath.\r\n\r\nI could ha’ wept for that poor youth that had died to avenge my honor.\r\nBut my first business was my safety, and I crept down as far as I might\r\nand dropped. By that time the catchpolls were crowding into the room\r\nabove. I struck the slanting hill and fell backward, but, getting to\r\nmy feet, which were very numb with the concussion of the fall, I sped\r\nbriskly into the darkness, making for the woods.\r\n\r\nI lay in their shelter an hour, and then resolved on a circumspection.\r\n’Twas not my intention to leave the mare behind, if so be she had\r\nescaped Grubbe and his creatures; and, moreover, I had other designs in\r\nmy head. So I made my way back deviously to the inn and reconnoitered.\r\nStillness hung about it, and after a time I marched up to the door\r\ncautiously and knocked on it.\r\n\r\nThe innkeeper opened it, and, the lamp burning on my face, started as\r\nif I were the devil.\r\n\r\n“Hush, man!” said I. “Is the officer gone?”\r\n\r\nHe looked at me dubiously and trembling. “Come,” said I, for I knew the\r\nreputation of those parts, “I am from Shoreham Gap yonder, and I was\r\nnear taken for an offense against the revenue.”\r\n\r\n“You are a smuggler?” said he anxiously. “They said you were a tobyman.”\r\n\r\n“They will take away any decent man’s name,” said I. “I want my horse.\r\nYou have no fancy for preventive men, I’ll guess.”\r\n\r\nAnd this was true enough, for he had a mine of cellars under his inn\r\nand through the roadway.\r\n\r\n“But your friend?” said he, still wavering. “Him that is dead——”\r\n\r\n“As good a man as ever rolled a barrel,” said I.\r\n\r\nHe relaxed his grip of the door. “’Tis a sore business for me this\r\nnight,” he complained.\r\n\r\n“Nay,” said I. “For I will rid your premises of myself and friend, by\r\nyour leave, or without it,” says I.\r\n\r\nHe seemed relieved at that, and I entered. The horses were safe, as I\r\ndiscovered, for Grubbe must have been too full of his own prime\r\nbusiness to make search, and, getting them out, I made my preparations.\r\nI strapped the lad’s body in the stirrups, so that he lay forward on\r\nthe horse with his head a-wagging; but (God deliver him!) his soul at\r\nrest. And presently we were on the road, and threading the wilderness\r\nof the black pine woods for the vale below toward London.\r\n\r\nThe moon was a glimmering arc across the Hurtwood as I came out on the\r\nback of Shere, and, pulling out of the long lane that gave entry to\r\nthe village, reined up by the “White Horse.” From the inn streamed a\r\nclamor of laughter, and without the doorway and wellnigh blocking it\r\nwas drawn up a carriage with a coachman on his seat that struck my eyes\r\ndimly in the small light. I was not for calling eyes on me with a dead\r\nman astride his horse, so I moved into the yard, thinking to drain a\r\ntankard of ale if no better, before I took the road over the downs to\r\nEffingham. But I was scarce turned into the yard ere a light flaring\r\nthrough the window poured on a face that changed all the notions in my\r\nskull. ’Twas Grubbe!\r\n\r\nLeaving the horses by I returned to the front of the inn, and says I to\r\nthe coachman that waited there, as I rapped loud on the door:\r\n\r\n“’Tis shrewish tonight.”\r\n\r\n“Aye,” says he in a grumbling, surly voice. “I would the country were\r\nin hell.”\r\n\r\n“Why, so ’twill be in good time,” said I cheerfully; and then to the\r\nman that came, “Fetch me two quarts well laced with gin,” says I, “for\r\nto keep the chill of the night and the fear o’ death out.”\r\n\r\nThe coachman laughed a little shortly, for he knew that this was his\r\ninvitation.\r\n\r\n“Whence come you then?” said I, delivering him the pot that was fetched\r\nout.\r\n\r\nHe threw an arm out. “Lewes,” said he, “under charge with a tobyman\r\nthat was for chains yonder.”\r\n\r\nHe nodded toward the downs and drank. I cast my eyes up and the loom of\r\nthe hill just t’other side of the village was black and ominous.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” says I, “he hangs there?”\r\n\r\n“At the top of London Road,” says he, dipping his nose again. “There\r\nstands the gallows, where the roads cross and near the Gate.”\r\n\r\n“Gallows Gate,” said I, laughing. “Well, ’twas a merry job enough.”\r\n\r\n“Aye,” says he. “But by this we might ha’ been far toward London Town,\r\nwhither most of us are already gone. But ’twas not his wish. He must\r\ncome back with the Lewes sheriff and drink him farewell.”\r\n\r\n“Leaving a poor likely young man such as yourself to starve of cold and\r\na empty belly here,” said I. “Well, I would learn such a one manners in\r\nyour place, and you shall have another tankard of dogs-nose for your\r\npains,” says I, whereat I called out the innkeeper again, but took care\r\nthat he had my share of the gin in addition to his own. By that time\r\nhe was garrulous, and had lost his caution, so, keeping him in talk a\r\nlittle and dragging his wits along from point to point, I presently\r\ncalled to him.\r\n\r\n“Come down,” said I, “and stamp your feet. ’Twill warm you without as\r\nthe liquor within.” And he did as I had suggested without demur.\r\n\r\n“Run round to the back,” says I, “and get yourself a noggin, and if\r\nso be you see a gentleman on horseback there asleep, why, ’tis only a\r\nfriend of mine that is weary of his long journey. I will call you if\r\nthere be occasion.”\r\n\r\nHe hesitated a moment, but I set a crown on his palm, and his scruples\r\nvanished. He limped into the darkness.\r\n\r\n’Twas no more than two minutes later that I heard voices in the\r\ndoorway, and next came Timothy Grubbe into the night, in talk with\r\nsomeone. At which it took me but thirty seconds to whip me into the\r\nseat and pull the coachman’s cloak about me, so that I sat stark and\r\nblack in the starlight. Grubbe left the man he talked with and came\r\nforward.\r\n\r\n“You shall drink when ye reach Cobham, Crossway,” says he, looking up at\r\nme, “and mind your ways, damn ye!”\r\n\r\nAnd at that he made no more ado, but humming an air he lurched into the\r\ncarriage. I pulled out the nags, and turned their heads so that they\r\nwere set for the north. And then I whistled low and short—a whistle I\r\nknew that the mare would heed, and I trusted that she would bring her\r\ncompanion with her. The wheels rolled out upon the road and Timothy\r\nGrubbe and I were bound for London all alone.\r\n\r\nAs I turned up the London road that swept steeply up the downs I looked\r\nback, and behind the moon shone faintly on Calypso and behind her on\r\nthe dead man wagging awkwardly in his stirrups.\r\n\r\nI pushed the horses on as fast as might be, but the ruts were still\r\ndeep in mud, and the carriage jolted and rocked and swayed as we went.\r\nThe wind came now with a little moaning sound from the bottom of the\r\nvalley, and the naked branches creaked above my head, for that way was\r\nsunken and tangled with the thickets of nut and yew. And presently I\r\nwas forced to go at a foot pace, so abrupt was the height. The moon\r\nstruck through the trees and peered on us, and Grubbe put his head\r\nforth of the window.\r\n\r\n“Why go you not faster, damn ye?” says he, being much in liquor.\r\n\r\n“’Tis the hill, your honor,” said I.\r\n\r\nHe glanced up and down.\r\n\r\n“What is it comes up behind?” says he, shouting. “There is a noise of\r\nhorses that pounds upon the road.”\r\n\r\n“’Tis the wind,” says I, “that comes off the valley and makes play\r\namong the branches.”\r\n\r\nHe sank back in his seat, and we went forward slowly. But he was\r\npresently out again, screaming on the night.\r\n\r\n“There is a horseman behind,” says he. “What does he there?”\r\n\r\n“’Tis a traveler, your honor,” says I, “that goes, no doubt, by our\r\nroad, and is bound for London.”\r\n\r\n“He shall be bound for hell,” says he tipsily, and falls back again.\r\n\r\nThe horses wound up foot by foot and emerged now into a space of better\r\nlight, and I looked around, and there was Grubbe, with his head through\r\nthe window and his eyes cast backward.\r\n\r\n“What fool is this,” says he, “that rides so awkwardly, and drives a\r\nspare horse? If he ride no better, I will ask him to keep me company,\r\nif he be a gentleman. Many gentlemen have rode along of me, and have\r\nrode to the gallows tree,” and he chuckled harshly.\r\n\r\n“Maybe he will ride with you to the Gallows Gate, sir,” says I.\r\n\r\n“Why, Crossway,” says he, laughing loudly, “you have turned a wit,” and\r\nonce more withdrew his head.\r\n\r\nBut now we were nigh to the top of the down, and I could see the faint\r\nshadow of the triple beam. With that I knew my journey was done, and\r\nthat my work must be accomplished. I pulled to the horses on the rise,\r\nand got down from my seat.\r\n\r\n“Why d’ye stop, rascal?” called Grubbe in a fury, but I was by the door\r\nand had it opened.\r\n\r\n“Timothy Grubbe,” said I, “ye’re a damned rogue that the devil, your\r\nmaster, wants and he shall have ye.”\r\n\r\nHe stared at me in a maze, his nostrils working, and then says he in a\r\nlow voice: “So, ’tis you.”\r\n\r\n“Your time has come, Timothy,” said I, flinging off my cloak, and I\r\ntook my sword. “Out with you, worm.”\r\n\r\nHe said never a word, but stepped forth, and looked about him. He was\r\nsobered now, as I could see from his face, which had a strange look on\r\nit.\r\n\r\n“Ye’re two rascals to one, Dick,” says he slowly, looking on the dead\r\nman on his horse which had come to a stop in the shadows.\r\n\r\n“No,” says I, “this gentleman will see fair play for us.”\r\n\r\nGrubbe took a step backward. “Sir,” says he, addressing the dead\r\nman—but at that moment Calypso and her companion started, and came\r\ninto the open.\r\n\r\nThe moon shone on the face of the dead. Grubbe uttered a cry, and\r\nturned on me. His teeth showed in a grin.\r\n\r\n“No ghost shall haunt me, Dick,” says he. “Rather shall another ghost\r\nkeep him company,” and his wry neck moved horribly.\r\n\r\nI pointed upward where the tobyman hung in chains, keeping his flocks\r\nby moonlight. “There’s your destiny,” said I. “There’s your doom. Now\r\ndefend, damn ye, for I’ll not prick an adder at a disadvantage.”\r\n\r\nHe drew his blade, for no man could say that Timothy Grubbe,\r\ntime-server and traitor as he was, lacked courage. Suddenly he sliced\r\nat me, but I put out and turned off the blow.\r\n\r\n“If you will have it so soon,” said I, “in God’s name have it,” and I\r\nran upon him.\r\n\r\nMy third stroke went under his guard, and I took him in the midriff. He\r\ngave vent to an oath, cursed me in a torrent, and struck at me weakly\r\nas he went down.\r\n\r\nHe was as dead as mutton almost ere he touched the ground.\r\n\r\nI have never been a man of the church, nor do I lay any claim to own\r\nmore religion than such as to make shift by when it comes to the\r\nend. No, nor do I deny that I have sundry offenses on my conscience,\r\nsome of which I have narrated in my memoirs. But when it comes to a\r\nreckoning I will make bold to claim credit in that I rid the world he\r\nhad encumbered of Timothy Grubbe—the foulest ruffian that ever I did\r\nencounter in the length of my days on the road.\r\n\r\nI climbed the beam and lowered the poor tobyman, and it took me but a\r\nlittle time to make the change. The one I left where he had paid the\r\nquittance in the peace of the earth, and t’other a-swinging under the\r\nlight of the moon on Gallows Gate.\r\n\r\nI have said my journey was done, but that was not so. There was more\r\nfor me to do, which was to deliver poor Masters at his lady-love’s and\r\nbreak the unhappy news. And so, leaving the carriage where it stood\r\nwith the patient horses that were cropping the grass, I mounted the\r\nmare and began to go down the long limb of the downs to the north.\r\n\r\n’Twas late—near midnight—when I reached Effingham and found my way\r\nto the manor. I rapped on the door, leaving Calypso and t’other in the\r\nshadows of the house, and presently one answered to my knock.\r\n\r\n“What is it?” says she.\r\n\r\n“’Tis a stranger,” says I, “that has news of grave import for Mistress\r\nAnne Varley, whom I beg you will call.”\r\n\r\n“She cannot hear you,” said she. “’Tis her wedding night.”\r\n\r\n“What!” said I in amazement, and instantly there flowed in on me the\r\nmeaning of this.\r\n\r\n“Curse all women save one or two!” thinks I. And I turned to the maid\r\nagain with my mind made up.\r\n\r\n“Look you, wench,” said I. “This is urgent. I have an instant message\r\nthat presses. And if so be your mistress will bear with me a moment and\r\nhold discourse, I’ll warrant she shall not regret it—nor you,” says I,\r\nwith a crown piece in my palm.\r\n\r\nShe hesitated and then, “Maybe she will refuse,” says she. “She hath\r\nbut these few hours been wed.”\r\n\r\n“Not she,” said I, “if you will tell her that I bring good news, great\r\nnews—news that will ease her spirit and send her to her bridal bed\r\nwith a happy heart.”\r\n\r\nAt that she seemed to assent, and with my crown in her hand she\r\ndisappeared into the darkening of the house. It must have been some ten\r\nminutes later that a light flashed in the hall and a voice called to me.\r\n\r\n“Who is it?” it asked, “and what want you at this hour?”\r\n\r\nI looked at her. She was of a pretty face enough, rather pale of color,\r\nand with eyes that moved restlessly and measured all things. Lord, I\r\nhave known women all my life in all stations, and I would ha’ pinned\r\nno certainty on those treacherous eyes. She was young, too, but had an\r\nair of satisfaction in herself, and was in no wise embarrassed by this\r\ninterview. I had no mercy on her, with her oaths of constancy writ in\r\nwater that figured to be tears and her false features.\r\n\r\n“Madam,” said I civilly, “I hear you’re wed today to a gentleman of\r\nstanding.”\r\n\r\n“What is that to you, sir?” she asked quickly.\r\n\r\n“’Tis nothing, for sure,” said I, “but to a friend of mine that I value\r\ndeeply ’tis much.”\r\n\r\n“You speak of Mr. Masters,” said she sharply, and with discomposure.\r\n“Sure, if he be a gentleman, he will not trouble me when he knows.”\r\n\r\n“Anne!” said a voice from the top of the stairs, “Anne!”\r\n\r\n’Twas her bridegroom calling. Well, she should go to him in what mood\r\nshe might when I had done with her.\r\n\r\n“He will never know,” says I, “unless he hear it from yourself.”\r\n\r\n“Anne!” said the voice above the stairs.\r\n\r\n“He shall not—I will not,” she cried angrily. “I will not be\r\npersecuted. ’Twas all a mistake.”\r\n\r\nI whistled. Calypso emerged from the night, and behind Calypso was\r\nthe horse with its burden. An anxious look dawned in her face. “I am\r\ninsulted,” says she and paused quickly.\r\n\r\n“Edward!” she called, and put a hand to her bosom.\r\n\r\n“Anne, darling!” cried the voice, “where are you? Come, child, ’tis\r\nlate.”\r\n\r\nThe horse came to a stop before the door with the body on the saddle,\r\nbound to the crupper.\r\n\r\n“What is it?” she cried in alarm, and suddenly she shrieked,\r\nrecognizing what was there. “It is an omen—my wedding night!”\r\n\r\n“Aye,” says I, “which be your bridegroom, he that calls or he that is\r\nsilent? Call on him and he hears not.”\r\n\r\nPeal after peal went up now from her, and the house was awake with\r\nalarm. I turned away, leaving her on the doorstep, and mounted the mare.\r\n\r\nAs I cantered off into the night I cast a glance behind me, and a group\r\nwas gathered at the door, and in that group lay Mistress Anne fallen in\r\na swoon, with the sleeping figure on the horse before her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _The Judge and the Jack Tar_\r\n\r\n\r\n                          BY HENRY H. CORNISH\r\n\r\n    It’s like this here, Your Honor, see?\r\n      As near as I can tell,\r\n    A gentleman hired my boat, and he\r\n      Was quite a proper swell.\r\n    He brought a lady down with him\r\n      To make a longish trip\r\n    And so we scrubbed her thoroughly—\r\n\r\n       _Judge_—The lady?\r\n       _Tar_—No! The ship\r\n\r\n    Well—cutting off my story short\r\n      To come to what befell\r\n    We started, but put back to port\r\n      Which much annoyed the swell.\r\n    She fell between two waterways\r\n      And got a nasty nip,\r\n    So we rigged her out with brand-new stays—\r\n\r\n       _Judge_—The lady?\r\n       _Tar_—No-o! The ship.\r\n\r\n    At last we put to sea again\r\n      And started for the west,\r\n    All spick and span without a stain\r\n      When all at once, I’m blest,\r\n    Her blooming timbers got misplaced,\r\n      Which quite upset the trip,\r\n    The water washed around her waist—\r\n\r\n       _Judge_—The lady’s?\r\n       _Tar_ (_nodding_)—And the ship’s.\r\n\r\n    That’s all, I think, Your Honor, now,\r\n      I’ll state to you my claim.\r\n    Five hundred dollars, you’ll allow,\r\n      Won’t build her up the same.\r\n    Her rudder’s gone, her nose is broke,\r\n      Her flag I’ve had to dip\r\n    She’s lying now upon the mud—\r\n\r\n       _Judge_—The lady?\r\n       _Tar_—No-o-o-o! The ship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _Object, Matrimony_\r\n\r\n\r\n                         BY CAROLINE LOCKHART\r\n\r\nWith a turn of his red wrist, Porcupine Jim guided his horse in and\r\nout among the badger holes which made riding dangerous business on\r\nthe Blackfoot Reservation. Perplexity and discontent rested upon\r\nPorcupine’s not too lofty brow. Though he looked at the badger holes\r\nand avoided them mechanically, he saw them not.\r\n\r\n“Would you tank, would you tank,” he burst out finally in a voice which\r\nrasped with irritation, “dat a girl like Belle Dashiel would rudder\r\nhave dat pigeon-toed, smart-Aleck breed dan me?”\r\n\r\nPorcupine’s pinto cayuse threw back one ear and listened attentively to\r\nthe naïve conceit of his rider’s soliloquy.\r\n\r\n“Look at me!” demanded Porcupine, changing the reins to his left hand\r\nthat he might make a more emphatic gesture with his right. “A honest\r\nSwede, able to make fifteen dollars a day at my trade. Me as has\r\nsheared sheep from Montany to the Argentine Republic, gittin’ bounced\r\nfor dat lazy half-breed dat can’t hold a yob two mont’!”\r\n\r\nPorcupine’s thoughts upon any subject were not varied, and he burst\r\nforth at intervals with a reiteration of the same idea until he came\r\nto the ridge where he could look down upon the house of Dashiel, the\r\nsquaw-man, who kept a sort of post office in a soapbox.\r\n\r\nPorcupine had come twenty-five miles for his mail. Not that he expected\r\nany, but to be gibed at by Belle Dashiel had the same fascination for\r\nhim that biting on a sore tooth has for a small boy. Gradually the\r\nknowledge had come to his slow-working mind that the half-breed girl’s\r\ninterest in him rose solely from the fact that John Laney was his\r\npartner in the assessment work which they were doing in the mountains\r\non a tenderfoot’s copper claim.\r\n\r\nLaney’s father had been an Irish steamboat captain on Lake Superior,\r\nhis mother, a Chippewa squaw, and the cross had produced an unusual\r\ntype. The Indian blood which keeps a half-breed silent and shy before\r\nstrangers had no such effect upon Laney. His prowess was his theme and\r\nhis vanity was a byword on the Reservation. He obtained his fashions\r\nfrom the catalogue of a wholesale house in Chicago which furnishes the\r\ntrusting pioneer with the latest thing in oil drills or feather boas.\r\nIt was common belief that Laney’s high celluloid collar would some day\r\ncut his head off.\r\n\r\nLaney’s waking hours were spent in planning schemes of primitive\r\ncrudeness whereby he might acquire affluence without labor. In his\r\ndreams the tenderfoot tourist was generally the person who was to\r\nremove him from penury.\r\n\r\n“Hello, Porcupine!” called Belle Dashiel, coming to the door with a\r\npink bow pinned on a pompadour of amazing height.\r\n\r\n“Hullo yourself!” replied Porcupine, elated at his ready wit and the\r\ncordiality in her voice.\r\n\r\n“How’s John?”\r\n\r\nThe smile faded from his face.\r\n\r\n“Good ’nough,” he replied shortly.\r\n\r\n“When’s he comin’ down?”\r\n\r\n“Dunno. Any mail for me?”\r\n\r\n“A letter and a paper.”\r\n\r\n“Who could be writin’ to me?”\r\n\r\nPorcupine looked surprised.\r\n\r\n“Didn’t you expect nothin’?” Belle Dashiel’s eyes shone mischievously.\r\n\r\n“Yass, I tank, mebby.” A deeper red spread over the Swede’s sunburned\r\nface.\r\n\r\nHe opened his letter and spelled it out laboriously, his chest heaving\r\nwith the effort.\r\n\r\n“A man over in Chicago he tank I’m in turrible need of a pianny,” he\r\nsaid in disgust, as he put the circular in the stove.\r\n\r\nPorcupine lingered till the chill of the night air crept into the\r\nsunshine of the September day. Then he put spurs to his patient cayuse\r\nand hit the trail which led into the fastnesses of the Rockies.\r\n\r\nThe light was not quite gone when he happened to think of the\r\npaper he had thrust in his coat-pocket. There might be news in it!\r\nBacon-Rind-Dick had told Two-Dog-Jack that there was a war over in\r\nJay-pan. Porcupine removed the wrapper and the words _Wedding Chimes_\r\nstared him in the face.\r\n\r\nAs he read, he laid the reins on his horse’s neck and let the pinto\r\npick his own road. The matrimonial sheet opened up a vista of romantic\r\nadventures and possibilities of which the Swede had never dreamed. His\r\nimagination, which naturally was not a winged thing, was fired until he\r\nsaw himself leading to his shack up the North Fork of the Belly River\r\nthe fairest and richest lady in the land. All he had to do was to send\r\nfive dollars to _Wedding Chimes_ and thus join their matrimonial club.\r\nUpon the receipt of the five dollars, the editor would send him the\r\nnames and addresses of several ladies who were all young, beautiful,\r\nwealthy and anxious to be married. He could open a correspondence with\r\none or all of them, and then choose for his bride the lady whose letter\r\nappealed to him most.\r\n\r\nPorcupine strained his eyes reading descriptions of lily-white blondes\r\nand dashing brunettes. When he could see no longer, he folded the\r\nprecious paper and buttoned it inside his coat.\r\n\r\nHis cayuse was puffing up the steep mountain trail in the darkness of\r\nthe thick pines and spruces when Porcupine suddenly let out a yell\r\nwhich startled the prowling lynx and made his pinto snort with fright.\r\nIt was a wild whoop of exultation. There had come to Porcupine one of\r\nthose rare revelations which have made men great. He fairly glowed\r\nand tingled with the inspiration which had flashed upon him as though\r\nsomeone had gone through his brain with a lantern.\r\n\r\nWhen he rode into camp, where Laney sat before the fire eating bacon\r\nout of a frying-pan, Porcupine’s deep-set blue eyes were shining like\r\nstars on a winter’s night.\r\n\r\n“Yass, I got de greatest ting in de mail you ever see, I tank!”\r\n\r\nLaney’s face expressed curiosity as the Swede sat down on a log and\r\nturned his felt hat round and round upon his bullet-shaped head—a\r\ntrick he had when excited. With great deliberation and impressiveness\r\nhe produced the paper and handed it to Laney. Laney set the frying-pan\r\nwhere his wolfhound could finish the bacon and opened the paper.\r\n\r\n“Young, beautiful, immensely rich; obj., mat.,” he read. Laney’s eyes\r\nsparkled. He read for half an hour of successful weddings brought\r\nabout by the editorial Cupid. Porcupine at last roused him from his\r\nabsorption.\r\n\r\n“Laney, I got a scheme, I tank. I’ll join up with one of dem clubs\r\nand you carry out de corryspondance with one of dem ladies. You are a\r\nbetter scholar den me and write a pooty goot letter. Den, if it goes\r\nall right, I’ll go and see her and tell her I ain’t exactly de man dat\r\ndone de writin’, but I’m just as goot.\r\n\r\n“’Tain’t no use for you to get into de club, because you are all the\r\nsame as promised to Belle Dashiel. Sure,” Porcupine went on, “Belle\r\nain’t rich nor beautiful like dem ladies in _Weddin’ Chimes_, but she’s\r\na goot little girl.\r\n\r\n“Old Dashiel ain’t got more dan fifty head of beef cattle, and dey say\r\nhe got a lot of runts in de last Govermint issue, but a ting like dat\r\ndon’t cut no ice if you’re stuck on de girl.”\r\n\r\nLaney moved uneasily and avoided Porcupine’s eyes.\r\n\r\n“Now for me,” continued the Swede, “I can marry any millionaire I want\r\nto.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs soon as the mails could get it there, the editor of _Wedding Chimes_\r\nreceived a neatly penciled and eloquent letter from one John Laney,\r\nsetting forth his especial needs and preferences, with considerable\r\nstress laid upon the financial standing of the matrimonial candidates.\r\n\r\nThe day the list was due Laney rode down for the mail. The eagerness\r\nwith which he took the letter from her hand did not escape Belle\r\nDashiel.\r\n\r\n“Got a new girl, John?” she asked lightly, though she watched his face\r\nwith suspicious eyes.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” replied Laney, and all her urging could not detain him.\r\n\r\nBy the light of the camp-fire Laney and Porcupine studied the list of\r\nnames and addresses sent from the office of the matrimonial paper.\r\n\r\n“This a-here one suits me,” said Laney. “‘Mayme Livingston, Oak Grove,\r\nIowa.’ It’s a toney-sounding name.”\r\n\r\n“It’s me dat’s gittin’ married,” Porcupine suggested significantly.\r\n“But Mayme’s all right, I tank. Go on ahead and write.”\r\n\r\nSo Laney, with the assistance of a sheet of ruled notepaper and a lead\r\npencil which he moistened frequently in order to shade effectively,\r\ncomposed a letter which he and Porcupine regarded not only as a model\r\nof cleverness but an achievement from a literary point of view. The\r\nlegal tone which gave it dignity was much admired by Porcupine. The\r\nletter read:\r\n\r\n                                 BELLY RIVER, MONT.\r\n   MISS MAYME LIVINGSTON:\r\n\r\n        DEAR MADAM: Whereas I have paid up five\r\n      dollars and have the priveledge of writing to any\r\n      lady on the list sent from the aforesaid matrimonial\r\n      paper, I, the undersigned, have picked out you, Miss\r\n      Mayme Livingston party of the first part, obj. mat.\r\n\r\n        I am an American, five feet seven, and quite dark.\r\n      I am interested in copper mines and cattle. I can\r\n      ride anything that wears hair and last winter I\r\n      killed two silver-tips and a link. I am engaged\r\n      somewhat in trapping also. They say I am a tony\r\n      dresser and I can dance the Portland Fancy or any\r\n      dance that I see once. I play the juice-harp, mouth\r\n      organ and accordian. I have a kind disposition and\r\n      would make a good husband to any lady who had a\r\n      little income of her own.\r\n\r\n        Let me hear from you as soon as you get this and\r\n      tell me what you think of my writing.\r\n                                  Respy. Yrs.\r\n                                     JOHN LANEY.\r\n\r\n        In witness whereof that this letter is true I have\r\n      hereunto set my hand and fixed my seal.\r\n                                 Porcupine Jim X his mark.\r\n\r\nThe days which followed the mailing of the above composition were\r\nthe longest Laney and Porcupine had ever known. They discussed Miss\r\nLivingston until they felt they knew her. Porcupine thought she had\r\nblack eyes, black hair, was inclined to stoutness, but with a good\r\n“figger.”\r\n\r\nThe name of Livingston to Laney conjured up a vision of blonde\r\nloveliness in red satin, slender, shapely, with several thousand\r\ndollars in a handbag which she kept always with her.\r\n\r\nMiss Livingston’s letter came with delightful promptness. There was an\r\nangry glow in Belle Dashiel’s Indian eyes as she handed the salmon-pink\r\nenvelope to Laney.\r\n\r\n“Who you writin’ to?” she demanded.\r\n\r\n“Business,” replied Laney bruskly, and strode out of the house.\r\n\r\nPorcupine, who had also come down, lingered a moment to tell her she\r\nlooked prettier each time that he saw her.\r\n\r\nMiss Livingston’s letter read:\r\n\r\n                  Mr. John Laney\r\n      deer sir. i take a few minutes to tell you how glad\r\n      i was to heer from you Away off in montana i have\r\n      not got Much Noos to rite but i will explain abot\r\n      Myself i am a suthoner and quite Dark to my Father\r\n      was a rice planter before the war which ruhined us\r\n      i hav a good Voice and sing in the Quire i danz\r\n      most evry Danc goin i have a Stiddy incom and make\r\n      hansom presints to annybody i Like if i met a perfect\r\n      Genelman i wold Marry him i cannot rite annymore\r\n      Today bekaws i hay Piz to make rite offen to\r\n                                      Miss Mayme Livingston\r\n        i think your Ritin is good i wish you wold send\r\n      your Fotegraf\r\n\r\n\r\nLaney’s brow was clouded as he folded the letter. “She ain’t much of a\r\nscholar,” he said. “You hardly ever see a scholar use little ‘i’s.’”\r\n\r\n“What differunce does dat make when she’s got a stiddy income?” replied\r\nPorcupine quickly. “And den what she said about handsome presents.\r\nSure, she’s a hairess, I tank.”\r\n\r\nLaney brightened at these reminders, and immediately set about\r\ncomposing another letter calculated to impress the wealthy, if\r\nunlettered, Miss Livingston.\r\n\r\n“Dear madam,” soon developed into “Dearest Mayme,” and “deer sir” as\r\nspeedily became “darlig John,” and, with each salmon-pink envelope’s\r\narrival, Laney’s coolness toward Belle Dashiel became more marked.\r\n\r\n“Porcupine,” said Laney, who had begun to show some reluctance in\r\nreading the correspondence to his partner, “the lady is gettin’ oneasy\r\nto see me, and when we finish runnin’ that drift in the lead, I think\r\nI’ll take a trip over to Iowa and see her.”\r\n\r\n“But where do I come in, mebby?” demanded Porcupine.\r\n\r\n“That’s what I’m goin’ for—to fix it up for you. Reely, Porcupine,”\r\nand he looked critically at the rawboned Swede, whose hair stood up\r\nlike the quills on the animal from which he had received his sobriquet,\r\n“it wouldn’t be right for you to break in on a lady without givin’ her\r\nwarning of what you was like.”\r\n\r\n“I know I ain’t pooty,” replied Porcupine unperturbed, “but I can make\r\nfifteen dollars a day at my trade.”\r\n\r\nThe tenderfoot’s assessment money went toward buying Laney a wardrobe\r\nwhich almost any one of Laney’s relatives or friends would have killed\r\nhim in his sleep to possess.\r\n\r\nA jeweler, advertising in _Wedding Chimes_, received an order for a\r\none-hundred-and-fifty-dollar scarfpin, to be paid for in instalments.\r\nPorcupine, whose nature was singularly free from envy, could not\r\nbut feel a pang when he saw the large horseshoe of yellow diamonds\r\nglittering in Laney’s red cravat.\r\n\r\nLaney had read that no gentleman should think of venturing into\r\npolite society without a “dress suit.” An order was sent for a\r\nseventy-five-dollar suit of evening clothes to the Chicago firm from\r\nwhom they bought their mining tools. When the clothes arrived Laney\r\ndressed himself in them one evening in their shack up the North Fork\r\nof Belly River, and Porcupine’s face showed the admiration he felt, as\r\nLaney strutted like a pheasant drumming on a log.\r\n\r\nLaney, who numbered among his accomplishments the ability to draw a\r\nrose or a horse so that almost anybody would know what it was, gave\r\nan original touch to his costume by purchasing at the Agency a brown\r\nbroad-brimmed felt hat and painting a red rose directly in front under\r\nthe stiff brim.\r\n\r\nWhen the drift was run and Laney’s wardrobe was complete, he and the\r\nSwede set out across the Reservation to the railroad station.\r\n\r\n“Pardner,” said Porcupine as he looked wistfully at the broadcloth coat\r\nwith satin revers and the tail sloped away like a grasshopper’s wings,\r\n“dey ain’t a friend you got, but me, dat would trust you to do their\r\ncourtin’ for them togged out like dat—sure, dat’s so!”\r\n\r\nThere was a derisive glint in Laney’s small back eyes; he held the\r\nslow-witted Swede in almost open contempt for his innocence. Porcupine\r\nshook hands with him on the platform and wished him good luck. “You’ll\r\ndo your best for me, pard?” he asked anxiously.\r\n\r\n“Trust me,” replied Laney gaily, intoxicated by the attention he was\r\nreceiving from the tourists in the Pullman car.\r\n\r\nPorcupine stopped at Dashiel’s on his return. Belle Dashiel met him at\r\nthe door and her eyes were blazing. Without being able to define the\r\nprocess of reasoning by which he arrived at the conclusion, Porcupine\r\nfelt that his brilliant plot stood an infinitely better show of success\r\nthat he did not find her in tears.\r\n\r\n“Where’s he gone at?” She stamped her moccasined foot imperiously.\r\n\r\n“I wouldn’t like to say,” replied Porcupine in a voice which denoted a\r\nwish to shield his partner and yet a noble, if unusual, desire to tell\r\nthe truth.\r\n\r\n“Tell me!” she commanded, and she put her small hand on the big Swede’s\r\narm as though she would shake him.\r\n\r\n“I tank,” answered Porcupine meekly; “I dunno, but I tank he’s gone to\r\nget married.”\r\n\r\nAs Laney sat in the day coach in his evening clothes, his broad hat\r\ntilted back from his coarse, swarthy face, a constant procession filed\r\nthrough the aisle and every eye rested upon his smiling and complacent\r\ncountenance. He passed two restless nights sleeping with his head on\r\nhis patent-leather valise, and monotonous days eating peanuts and\r\nslaking his thirst at the ice-tank in the corner of the car. The farther\r\nhe got from home, the more attention he attracted, which was some\r\nrecompense for the inconvenience he was enduring.\r\n\r\nHe had plenty of time to decide a question which had much perplexed\r\nhim: Could he immediately address the lady as “Mayme” and kiss her\r\nupon sight, or should he call her Miss Livingston and merely shake her\r\nhand? If too demonstrative, he might frighten her—capital is shy, as\r\nall men know. On the other hand, women resent coldness—now there was\r\nBelle Dashiel. Something which, if developed, might have proved to be\r\na conscience, gave him a twinge, and he hastened to put the half-breed\r\ngirl from his thoughts.\r\n\r\nHe reviewed the subject of his greeting from all possible sides,\r\nand decided that, in view of the many endearing phrases which Miss\r\nLivingston’s letters had contained and the neat border of “o’s,”\r\nlabeled “kisses,” which had ornamented her last letter, he could feel\r\nreasonably safe in planting a chaste salute upon her trembling lips.\r\nAlso he wondered how long it would be before he could hint at a small\r\nloan.\r\n\r\nWhen they returned from their bridal tour they would take the best room\r\nin the hotel at the Agency, and he and work would be strangers ever\r\nafter. He would send to Great Falls for a top buggy, and buy a mate to\r\ndrive with his brown colt. He would get a long, fawn-colored overcoat\r\nand a diamond ring. He paused in the erection of his air castle to read\r\nagain the letter which had reached him just before his departure.\r\n\r\n        “i will be at the Depo in a purple Satin wast with\r\n      red roses in my Hat you can’t help but see me,” said\r\n      the penciled lines. “i am tickled to deth that you\r\n      are coming be Sure an com on the 3.37 thursday o how\r\n      can i wait till then.”\r\n\r\nLaney smiled contentedly and returned the letter to his pocket. For the\r\nhundredth time he consulted the time-table. “Jimminy Christmas!—only\r\nthree hours more!” He hastened to wash his hands and face, having\r\npostponed that ceremony until he should near Oak Grove. The bosom of\r\nhis pleated shirt was rumpled, and his dress clothes showed that he\r\nhad slept in them; but trifles could not mar his happiness. He oiled\r\nhis black hair from a small bottle containing bear grease scented with\r\nbergamot, and adjusted his cravat that the horseshoe might show to\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nWhen after a century of nervous tension the train whistled at the\r\noutskirts of Oak Grove, Laney’s knees were trembling beneath him and\r\nit seemed as though the thumping of his heart would choke him. He\r\nswallowed hard as, the solitary arrival, he descended the car steps and\r\nlooked about him.\r\n\r\nThere was a flash of purple satin and an avalanche seemed to bury Laney\r\nin a moist embrace.\r\n\r\n“Hyar yo’ is, honey!” cried a ringing, triumphant voice in his ear as\r\nhe struggled to free himself. “Ah knowed you’d come!”\r\n\r\n“Good Gawd!” cried Laney as he broke loose and jumped back. “Black!\r\nBlack as a camp coffee-pot!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, honey, I’se black, but I’se lovin’!” and Miss Livingston advanced\r\nupon him with sparkling eyes and an expanse of gleaming ivories.\r\n\r\n“What for a game you been giving me?” demanded Laney, retreating to the\r\nedge of the platform. “You said you were the daughter of a Southern\r\nplanter.”\r\n\r\n“So I is, so I is,” replied that lady in a conciliatory tone. “Mah\r\nfather planted rice foah Colonel Heywood down in South Caroliny till he\r\ndied.”\r\n\r\n“But your money, your steady income——”\r\n\r\n“Eb’ry Sataday night Ah draws mah little ole five dollars foah cookin’\r\nin a res-ta-rant.”\r\n\r\nMiss Livingston’s mood suddenly changed. From a pleading, loving maiden\r\nshe became an aggressive termagant; from the defensive she assumed the\r\noffensive, gripping her pearl-handled parasol in a suggestive manner.\r\n\r\n“Say, yo’ Wil’ Man of Borneo, dressed up in them outlannish clothes,\r\nwhat you mean tellin’ me yo’ was an American?”\r\n\r\nLaney made a feeble effort to explain that he was of the race of true\r\nAmericans, but he might as well have tried to be heard above the\r\nroaring of a storm in the Belly River cañon.\r\n\r\n“Black, is I?” continued the dusky whirlwind, her voice rising to\r\na shriek. “Maybe you think yo’ look like a snow-bank! What kin’ of\r\na rag-time freak is yo,’ anyhow? If you think yo’ can ’gage mah\r\n’ffections den ’spise me ’cause Ah ain’t no blonde, you’se mistaken in\r\ndis chile! Ah don’ stand for no triflin’ from no man. If yo’ scorn me,\r\nyo’ ‘What is it’ from de sideshow, Ah’ll have yo’ tuck up foah britch\r\nof promise!”\r\n\r\nJohn Laney waited to hear no more. He grabbed his shining valise from\r\nthe platform and ran down the nearest alley.\r\n\r\nThe _Iowa Granger_ said editorially in its next issue:\r\n\r\n        We had a narrow escape from death last Thursday\r\n      evening. We were mistaken by an intoxicated redskin\r\n      for the editor of a matrimonial publication known as\r\n      _Wedding Chimes_. Had we not pasted the infuriated\r\n      savage one with the mucilage pot, and defended\r\n      ourself with the scissors which, fortunately, we had\r\n      in our hand at the time, undoubtedly the paper of\r\n      September 12th would have been the last issue of the\r\n      _Iowa Granger_. Our compositor came to our rescue in\r\n      the nick of time.\r\n\r\n        The redskin is now in the calaboose, but refuses\r\n      to divulge his name or residence.

Daily Paper._\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is an island surrounded by rivers, and about it the tide scurries\r\nfast and deep. It is a beautiful island, long, narrow, magnificently\r\npopulated, and with such a wealth of life and interest as no island in\r\nthe world has ever before possessed. Long lines of vessels of every\r\ndescription nose its banks. Enormous buildings and many splendid\r\nmansions line its streets.\r\n\r\nIt is filled with a vast population, millions coming and going, and is\r\nthe scene of so much life and enthusiasm and ambition that its fame is,\r\nas the sound of a bell, heard afar.\r\n\r\nAnd the interest which this island has for the world is that it is\r\nseemingly a place of opportunity and happiness. If you were to listen\r\nto the tales of its glory carried the land over and see the picture\r\nwhich it presents to the incoming eye, you would assume that it was\r\nall that it seemed. Glory for those who enter its walls seeking glory.\r\nHappiness for those who come seeking happiness. A world of comfort and\r\nsatisfaction for all who take up their abode within it—the island of\r\nbeauty and delight.\r\n\r\nThe sad part of it is, however, that the island and its beauty are, to\r\na certain extent, a snare. Its seeming loveliness, which promises so\r\nmuch to the innocent eye, is not always easy of realization. Thousands\r\ncome, it is true; thousands venture to reconnoiter its mysterious\r\nshores. From the villages and hamlets of the land is streaming a\r\nconstant procession of pilgrims, the feeling of whom is that here is\r\nthe place where their dreams are to be realized; here is the spot where\r\nthey are to be at peace. That their hopes are not, in so many cases,\r\nto be realized, is the thing which gives a poignant sadness to their\r\ncoming. The beautiful island is not possessed of happiness for all.\r\n\r\nAnd the exceptional tragedy of it is that the waters which surround the\r\nbeautiful island are forever giving evidence of the futility of the\r\ndreams of so many. If you were to stand upon its shore, where the tide\r\nscurries past in its never-ending hurry, or were to idle for a time\r\nupon its many docks and piers, which reach far out into the water and\r\ngive lovely views of the sky and the gulls and the boats, you might\r\nsee drifting past upon the bosom of the current some member of all the\r\nambitious throng who, in time past, has set his face toward the city,\r\nand who entered only to find that there was more of sorrow than of\r\njoy. Sad, white-faced maidens; grim, bearded, time-worn men; strange,\r\nstrife-worn, grief-stricken women, and, saddest of all, children—soft,\r\nwan, tender children, floating in the waters which wash the shores of\r\nthe island city.\r\n\r\nAnd such waters! How green they look; how graceful, how mysterious!\r\nFrom far seas they come—strange, errant, peculiar waters—prying along\r\nthe shores of the magnificent island; sucking and sipping at the rocks\r\nwhich form its walls; whispering and gurgling about the docks and piers\r\nand flowing, flowing, flowing. Such waters seem to be kind, and yet\r\nthey are not so. They seem to be cruel, and yet they are not so; merely\r\nindifferent these waters are—dark, strong, deep, indifferent.\r\n\r\nAnd curiously the children of men who come to seek the joys of the city\r\nrealize the indifference and the impartiality of the waters. When the\r\nvast and beautiful island has been reconnoitered, when its palaces have\r\nbeen viewed, its streets disentangled, its joys and its difficulties\r\ndiscovered, then the waters, which are neither for nor against, seem\r\ninviting. Here, when the great struggle has been ended, when the years\r\nhave slipped by and the hopes of youth have not been realized; when\r\nthe dreams of fortune, the delights of tenderness, the bliss of love\r\nand the hopes of peace have all been abandoned—the weary heart may\r\ncome and find surcease. Peace in the waters, rest in the depths and the\r\nsilence of the hurrying tide; surcease and an end in the chalice of the\r\nwaters which wash the shores of the beautiful island.\r\n\r\nAnd they do come, these defeated ones, not one, nor a dozen, nor a\r\nscore every year, but hundreds and hundreds. Scarcely a day passes but\r\none, and sometimes many, go down from the light and the show and the\r\nmerriment of the island to the shores of the waters where peace may be\r\nfound. They stop on its banks; they reflect, perhaps, on the joys which\r\nthey somehow have missed; they give a last, despairing glance at the\r\nwonderful scene which once seemed so joyous and full of promise, and\r\nthen yield themselves unresistingly to the arms of the powerful current\r\nand are borne away. Out past the docks and the piers of the wonderful\r\ncity. Out past its streets, its palaces, its great institutions.\r\nOut past its lights, its colors, the sound of its merriment and its\r\nseeking, and then the sea has them and they are no more. They have\r\naccomplished their journey, the island its tragedy. They have come down\r\nto the rivers of the nameless dead. They have yielded themselves as a\r\nsacrifice to the variety of life. They have proved the uncharitableness\r\nof the island of beauty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Wouldn’t Admit It_\r\n\r\n\r\nMARJORIE—At the meeting of the Spinsters’ Club the members told why\r\nthey had never married.\r\n\r\nMADGE—What reason did they give?\r\n\r\nMARJORIE—All kinds, except that they had never got the chance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                            _Satiated_\r\n\r\nWASHINGTONIAN—Wouldn’t you like to visit the Senate some day while\r\nyou’re here?\r\n\r\nGUEST—No, I guess not.

From various\r\nsources we are told that man ought to be happy. “Whatever is, is good,”\r\nis the handwriting on the wall. Content is preached from what George\r\nEliot called “that Goshen of Mediocrity,” the pulpit; and politicians\r\npublish their elastic statistics, proving prosperity and content. This\r\nproselyting Optimism reached its height in the advent of Charles Wagner\r\nto our hospitable shores and in the thrusting of his little book, “The\r\nSimple Life,” under the nose of the public.\r\n\r\nThe book was published here several years ago, but has lain unnoticed\r\nuntil today. Our sudden torridity of welcome makes one reflect upon\r\na dog who tramples on the grass beneath his feet and feeds on offal;\r\nsuddenly he begins to eat the grass and then we cry, “The dog is sick!”\r\nHumanity has a canine instinct for its needs. Its tastes must ripen. We\r\ncan neither hasten nor retard them.\r\n\r\nAs it takes the fever of intoxication to appreciate the purity of\r\nwater; as the quiet of repose must follow the stress of effort, so man\r\nnow turns to the sweet nothingness of a dream, amid the warring clash\r\nof realities.\r\n\r\nThat Wagner’s idyl of simplicity is but a dream, a sigh of the\r\nimagination, only idealists can deny. Civilization and Simplicity!\r\nBedlam and Elysium! Nirvana on the Tower of Babel! All these alliances\r\nare equally possible.\r\n\r\nThe very fact of his dream arousing such a storm of approval awakens\r\nsuspicion. Insistence is always a confession of doubt. Man never talks\r\nso much of his happiness as when he is unhappy. This is demonstrated in\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\nWagner’s arrival in America was singularly opportune. Certainly it\r\nwas fortunate that his little olive branch was given to the public\r\njust when it was clamoring for something. Its palms were itching for\r\nsome of the sugar-plums the Privileged Few had wrested from it, and\r\nit was beginning to get noisy. Yes, that hydrocephalic infant, the\r\nProletariat, was beginning to sob for the golden spoon in the mouth\r\nof Special Privilege, when, lo and behold! the powers behind the\r\nthrone go to Paris and bring back the soothing syrup of Wagner and his\r\nphilosophy. The infant lets the Pharisee dope him, and he drops the\r\nunintelligible complexities of Franchises, Trusts, Labor Problems and\r\nWrongs to grab the little woolly lamb of Content.\r\n\r\nSurely the importers of Wagner are altruists, to try thus to make\r\nthe public so happy. And that Wagner has had importers as well as\r\nindorsers, the Initiated know. Nevertheless, Wagner is a remarkable\r\nman. He is remarkable in resembling two historical characters and also\r\nin possessing the aptitudes for several vocations.\r\n\r\nHe resembles Rousseau. Rousseau sang the same little Psalm of\r\nSimplicity in the most artificial and febrile period of France. The\r\nPhilistines shrieked the same applause, and even tried to eat the\r\nprescribed grass. He resembles Mme. de Pompadour. When no longer she\r\ncould charm the palled fancy of Louis XV as Circe, coquette, dancer or\r\n_grande dame_, she assumed the garb of a peasant girl.\r\n\r\nThat was one of the early triumphs of simplicity. Art is always a\r\nsurprise. Its sole function is to astonish. Therein Wagner is an artist.\r\n\r\nHe is also a civil engineer, for he has mastered the cosmic momentum.\r\nThe world is a seesaw. It exists by the eternal balance of contrasts.\r\nWagner, seeing the excess, has given us the weight to restore our\r\nequipoise. He has led us back like refractory children to drink of milk\r\nafter we have eaten _marrons glacés_ and liked them. Of course they\r\nhave given us indigestion, and that is where Wagner fills the role of\r\nphysician; he diagnoses our disease, he places his finger upon the very\r\n“Malady of the Century,” and he prescribes—sugar pills. This shows his\r\ngreat wisdom, for sugar pills and the dissecting-knife should form the\r\nsole equipment of every physician.\r\n\r\nWagner is also a philanthropist. His aim is to make us happy, and\r\nhis method is to make us believe that a gridiron is a lyre and that\r\ncobblestones may be Apples of the Hesperides. He tells us that as\r\nthings now are, each child is “born into a joyless world; that the\r\ncomplexities of our lives have led us into the Slough of Despond; that\r\nCivilization has been futile, for it has left us miserable.” And for\r\nall our ills he gives us the panacea of content, simplicity and repose.\r\nHe summons us to be “merely human, to have the courage to be men and\r\nleave the rest to Him who numbered the stars. Each life should wish to\r\nbe what it is good for it to be, without troubling about anything else.”\r\n\r\nThis is the gospel of non-resistance, of quietism. The absurdity of\r\nit is attested by every step we take, for do they not say we could\r\nnot walk were it not for the resistance of the ground? Eating, alone,\r\nis a triumph over opposition. He wishes to steep us in the _dolce far\r\nniente_ of Content, and tells us in order to do so all that is needed\r\nis our confidence and trust.\r\n\r\n“An imperturbable faith in the stability of the universe and its\r\nintelligent ordering sleeps in everything that exists. The flowers, the\r\ntrees, the beasts of the field live in calm strength, in entire\r\nsecurity.”\r\n\r\nWe must remember that Wagner lives in Paris, and, therefore, make\r\nallowances for this last statement. He probably has never seen any\r\nbeasts of the field except in the cages of the Zoo, else he could not\r\nhave such exuberant faith in their confidence and security. He could\r\nnever have studied the stealthy horrors of the forests—the furtive\r\npanther—the relentless viper—their trembling victims—and possess\r\nsuch a genial conviction of the mercy and goodness of this scheme of\r\ncreation. No, he must look away from nature for his examples of harmony\r\nand peace.\r\n\r\nHis perpetual refrain is, “Be human and be simple.” Civilization’s\r\nanswer is that the two are incompatible. Evolution tends to complexity\r\nas inevitably as growth leads to death. The beginnings of all things\r\nare simple—people, theories of government and vegetable seeds. But the\r\nlaws of life will not leave them thus. Like American policemen, their\r\ncontinual order is “move on.”\r\n\r\nWe would have had no history had it not been for man’s love of novelty.\r\nIt is the one enduring thing. The anthropology of the world is but\r\nthe record of man’s taste for the strange. Yet Wagner says, “Novelty\r\nis ephemeral. Nothing endures but the commonplace, and if one departs\r\nfrom that, it is to run the most perilous risk. Happy he who is able to\r\nreclaim himself, who finds the way back to simplicity.”\r\n\r\nAfter reading pages of hazy verbiage descriptive of this simplicity,\r\none cannot but see that his ideal is a vapory creation, a fusing of\r\nthe honest animality of the savage and the calloused quietism of the\r\nlotus-eater.\r\n\r\nSimplicity! What prototypes have we for it in all humanity? Two\r\npossible types suggest themselves, the savage and the hermit. But\r\nDarwin shows us that we cannot find simplicity in the savage. Like\r\ncivilized man, his instincts are toward exaggeration. He, too, in his\r\nlimited way, tries to escape from the realities of life. His protest\r\nagainst truth is tattooing. His idea of beauty is distortion.\r\n\r\nAs the great anatomist, Bichat, long ago said, “If everyone were cast\r\nin the same mold, there would be no such thing as beauty. If all our\r\nwomen were to become as beautiful as the Venus de Medici, we should\r\nsoon wish for a variety. We should wish to see certain characters a\r\nlittle exaggerated beyond the existing common standard.”\r\n\r\nAll the philosophizing of the optimist won’t thwart this tendency\r\nof human nature, and it is as futile to bewail “the Vice of the\r\nSuperlative,” the complexities and hyperboles of life, as it would\r\nbe to bewail the inevitability of death. Thus we see we cannot find\r\nsimplicity in man’s primitive form, the savage.\r\n\r\nWe must, then, look for it in one of his acquired forms—in the\r\nidealist who can make of himself a mental Robinson Crusoe, or in the\r\nhermit of the monastery or the desert. It must be in some isolated\r\nbeing that we seek simplicity, for certainly it can never be found amid\r\n“the madding crowd” and its “ignoble strife.” In solitude alone can\r\none cultivate that contemplative apathy of the mind which Wagner calls\r\npeace, which Mahatmas call divinity, and wives call selfishness.\r\n\r\nBut solitude is not good for man. With it we punish our worst criminals\r\nand our old maids. Victor Hugo says, “It makes a god or a devil of\r\nman.” Neither of these superlative beings could exist in Wagner’s\r\ntemperate zone. Wagner yearns for quiet and rest, and where can we find\r\nthem? Scientists tell us nothing in the world is at rest. There are but\r\ntwo spots on the earth which don’t move with it—the poles. And God has\r\nmade them uninhabitable—as a lesson.\r\n\r\nIf Wagner could reach them, he might build his Utopia there, warm it\r\nwith a rainbow and fertilize it with the waters of Lethe.\r\n\r\nYet humanity must have these Arcadian dreams. The epochs are strewn\r\nwith them. Periodically man grows tired of the spiced flavors of his\r\nrepasts and would fain go out in the woods and gather manna from\r\nheaven. The effort has always been disastrous. We had the experiment\r\nof the Perfectionists, the Icarians, the Owenites, the Harmonists and\r\nBrook Farm. They were all founded on simplicity and were all dissolved\r\nbecause of the difference between theory and practice. This is\r\nunfortunate.\r\n\r\nAn ideal is like a schoolboy’s ruler—it is very good to measure by,\r\nbut is very frail to build a habitation with. Optimism is a good thing,\r\nand so is Pessimism. But Optimism alone is popular; man does not like\r\nto be told the faults of the universe any more than to be told of his\r\nown faults. This accounts for his hospitality to all the myopic dogmas\r\nof Optimism, and his antipathy to the equally true tenets of Pessimism.\r\n\r\nIt is as if one faction believed only in the actuality of the day,\r\nand the other admitted only the existence of night. Their polemics\r\nsuggest the law of gravitation run mad. What if there were only a law\r\nof attraction and none of repulsion? Certainly we would all be merged\r\ninto one. But this union would be chaos and extinction. Our repulsions\r\nand suspicions save us. They make an individual where the Optimist with\r\nhis one law of attraction would have an inert mass. The Lord’s Prayer\r\nshould be changed to “Deliver us from evil—and good.”\r\n\r\nToo great a bias toward a recognition of either is dangerous. The one\r\ninculcates content—the other discontent. But of the two, discontent is\r\nby far the safer. If content had been universal, our present degree of\r\nenlightenment and justice would have been impossible.\r\n\r\nContent means egotism, inaction and stagnation. Discontent means\r\nreformation, revolution and progress. All our great men were\r\ndiscontented. All our imbecile kings were contented—and tried to make\r\ntheir serfs so. Whose mind was the most beneficial to the world—the\r\nfermenting, aggressive brain of Luther, or the tranquil cerebellum\r\nof the gorged Vitellius? Civilization has arisen from discontent.\r\nDiscontent means upheaval, and upheaval is to a nation what plowing is\r\nto the corn. Sir Robert Peel defined agitation to be “the marshaling of\r\nthe conscience of a nation to mold its laws.”\r\n\r\nWhat we want at present is not peace, but agitation. There are too many\r\nwrongs to be righted—too many national dragons to be slain to respond\r\nyet awhile to Wagner’s call to disarmament! What we need are spears,\r\nnot olive branches; the flag of battle, not the flag of truce.\r\n\r\nWagner wishes to give us happiness. But man’s effort for selfish,\r\npersonal happiness has caused all the miseries of the world.\r\n\r\nIt is by persistently closing their eyes to the sorrows of man that our\r\ncommercial pirates can so tranquilly exist. I believe that when man\r\nsees that he cannot make life enjoyable he will then turn his attention\r\nto making it endurable. At present our safest philosophy is the belief\r\nin progress by antagonism, and our duty is to unsheathe the sword of\r\nrebellion from the scabbard of ignorance, and do battle against all\r\ndespots and oppressors!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _Defined_\r\n\r\n\r\n“WHAT is domestic economy, Professor?”\r\n\r\n“Buying your cigars with the money you save on your wife’s clothing.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                        _The Modern Table_\r\n\r\nFREDDIE—What is interest, dad?\r\n\r\nDAD—Six per cent is legal rate, 25 is pawnbroking, 100 is\r\nusury, while 600 is high finance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                          _The Faddist_\r\n\r\nCOBWIGGER—When did your home cease to be a happy one?\r\n\r\nDORCAS—When my wife joined a lot of clubs that made a business of\r\nmaking other people’s homes happy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                        _A Family Secret_\r\n\r\nCRAWFORD—I hear he does nothing but talk about his money.\r\n\r\nCRABSHAW—Yes.

JOHNSTON\r\n\r\n“Must be something doing,” said the night-clerk to the room-clerk,\r\nnodding in the direction of a middle-aged man who was being piloted\r\ntoward the elevator by a bell-boy. “That’s Martin, the banker, going\r\nup to see the Senator. There’s three others ahead of him. The Senator\r\nwas expecting them, too, for he told me when they came in to have them\r\nshown up to his sitting-room at once.”\r\n\r\n“Who are the others?” asked the room-clerk, raising his eyes from his\r\nledger to look after the departing form of the man who—next to Russell\r\nSage—was reputed to have command of the largest amount of ready money\r\nof any man in the United States.\r\n\r\n“Well,” replied the night-clerk, taking advantage of the dulness of a\r\nrainy night in the spring to engage in more extended conversation than\r\nthe exigencies of his calling usually permitted, “the first one to\r\narrive was Congressman Woods. He’s stopping over at the Waldorf. This\r\nis only his second term in the House, but they say he is practically\r\nleader of his party. Not ten minutes after him was Higgins, who used to\r\nbe comptroller, or something of the sort. He’s made a pile of money in\r\nthe Street in the last few years. They say that last corner in wheat\r\nnetted him about two million. I wouldn’t care if I stood close enough\r\nto him to get a tip once in awhile on the way things were going. There\r\nwould be more in it than following the horses, although that ain’t\r\nsaying much, judging by the run of bad luck I have had lately. Just\r\nbefore Martin came in Tom Connors went upstairs.”\r\n\r\n“Tom’s rather out of his latitude, ain’t he?” said the room-clerk. “It\r\nain’t often he gets in with such big fellows, is it?”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you fool yourself,” replied the night-clerk. “Maybe Tom Connors\r\ndoesn’t get his name in the society news as often as the rest of them,\r\nbut all the same he stands about as near next the Senator as anyone in\r\ntown. Tom Connors has a big pull in Washington, and almost as big a\r\none with the bankers here. With the chances he has the only reason Tom\r\nConnors ain’t a millionaire is because he’s such a spender. Tom is a\r\nworking partner in a good many Senate deals or steals, whichever you\r\nwant to call them, unless I’m much mistaken.”\r\n\r\nThe arrival of several guests put an end to the conversation. The\r\nroom-clerk turned once more to his ledger and the night-clerk began\r\nreaching for keys and yelling, “Front!” An hour or two later the men\r\nbehind the desk were at leisure again when “Ed” Wallace strolled up.\r\nTo him the night-clerk imparted the information that the Senator was\r\nhaving some sort of a séance in his rooms, incidentally mentioning who\r\nwere there.\r\n\r\nWallace hastened over to the corner where several members of that\r\nunorganized organization, “the political combination,” the brightest\r\nreporters of the big newspapers, were exchanging reminiscences. “The\r\nmost news with the least work” is the motto of the “combination.” It\r\nmeans that whatever news one of them gets, all get—with considerably\r\nless labor than if each worked independently, and with the chance of a\r\nrival newspaper scoring a “beat” reduced to the minimum.\r\n\r\nVarious theories as to the meaning of the conference upstairs were\r\nsuggested and rejected. The five men in the Senator’s rooms were not\r\npolitical allies—that the reporters well knew. That they were all,\r\nwith the exception perhaps of the Western representative, warm personal\r\nfriends, they knew equally well. But despite its knowledge of the men\r\nand its familiarity with the political situation, the “combination” was\r\nunable to deduce anything that could be printed.\r\n\r\n“I’ll give it up,” said Stanley Titus. “The only thing I see is for\r\nWallace to go upstairs and see what is going on. The Senator will talk\r\nto him if he’ll talk to anyone, and perhaps we can get a line on what’s\r\ndoing.”\r\n\r\nWhen Wallace, two minutes later, knocked on the door of the Senator’s\r\nsitting-room, it was the Senator himself who opened it—just about two\r\ninches—and peered impatiently into the hall.\r\n\r\n“Oh, it’s you, is it, Wallace?” he said. “Well, my boy, what can I do\r\nfor you?”\r\n\r\n“The combination would like to know if you have anything to say for\r\npublication about the conference that is going on in there,” replied\r\nWallace.\r\n\r\nThe Senator put his head a little farther out the door. “I will tell\r\nyou something, but you will understand that it is not for publication,”\r\nhe said, dropping his voice to a whisper as Wallace leaned forward\r\nexpectantly. “I’ve got all the blues.” And the door was shut in\r\nWallace’s face.\r\n\r\nBut there were no chips or cards on the table to which the Senator\r\nreturned after shutting the door. The five men, their wrinkled brows\r\nbetokening hard thinking, were intently studying neatly tabulated\r\nstatements—long rows of figures—that might mean much or little,\r\ndepending entirely on the observer’s information as to their purpose.\r\n\r\n“As I was saying,” the Senator began, taking up the conversation\r\nwhere he had dropped it to answer the knock, “I am fully convinced\r\nthat $10,000,000 will see it through. Out of that the expenses of\r\nengineering the deal will amount to, say, a million. The actual\r\nexpenses of collection should not exceed more than ten per cent., and I\r\nbelieve with Mr. Connors that a good part of it can be done with five\r\nper cent. That million is all we stand to lose, for the rest will be\r\ninvested in goods worth their face value, whether the plan succeeds\r\nor fails. I believe that it will succeed and I am ready to guarantee\r\none-fourth of the sum needed. If each of the others present, with the\r\nexception of Mr. Connors, will do the same, we will have the money. As\r\nMr. Connors is the originator of the plan and will have to superintend\r\nthe carrying out of the details, I think that without being expected to\r\ninvest any money he should receive one-tenth of the net profits, and\r\nthe residue can be divided equally among the rest of us.”\r\n\r\nThere were no dissenters to the Senator’s proposition, least of all\r\nTom Connors. After some little discussion as to details, the date for\r\ncarrying out the plan was fixed as the first Friday in October, or\r\nrather the first Friday and Saturday, as it was calculated that two\r\ndays would be required to consummate the work.\r\n\r\nWhen the conference adjourned an hour later Mr. Higgins, the former\r\ncomptroller, Representative Woods and the Senator each had agreed to\r\nhave by the first day of September $2,500,000 in available cash, which\r\nMr. Martin, the banker, joining with $2,500,000 of his own, could\r\nutilize in carrying out the scheme proposed by Tom Connors, who in lieu\r\nof capital had pledged himself to an immense amount of hard work, in\r\nconsideration of which he was to receive one-tenth of the profits.\r\n\r\nThere was no good reason for calling it the Fractional Currency Bill,\r\nfor in reality it was an anti-fractional currency bill. It provided\r\nthat after the fifteenth day of September the Government of the United\r\nStates should not issue or cause to be issued, or coin or cause to be\r\ncoined, any half-dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels, two-cent pieces\r\nor pennies, and also that none of the fractional currency already in\r\nexistence in the possession of the United States should be put into\r\ncirculation for a period of five years after the date on which the law\r\nbecame operative.\r\n\r\nThe bill made its appearance in the House and Senate a few days after\r\nthe opening of the special session called by the President to meet\r\non the twelfth day of July. Strange to say, neither the Senator nor\r\nRepresentative Woods seemed to be much interested in it. Both voted\r\nfor it after having made brief speeches in its support, but they were\r\nonly two of many that did the same. The father of the bill in the House\r\nwas Hicks, of California, and in his State the measure was known as\r\nthe Hicks bill. The patron of the measure in the Senate was Gordon, of\r\nMaine. Neither of these men heretofore had been recognized as having\r\nmuch influence with their associates, but in this instance their pet\r\nbill at once found favor in the eyes of their colleagues.\r\n\r\nIt is a peculiar thing about the American law-maker—the real author\r\nof legislation—that he seldom, if ever, appears at the front. He\r\nis content that some of the small fry shall have the distinction of\r\nfathering the laws and be recorded in history as the men who did\r\nthis or that for their country’s good. The real leaders of American\r\npolitical life and actions seem to think that post-mortem fame is more\r\nthan outweighed by more substantial ante-mortem things.\r\n\r\nSimple as the measure seemed to read, so equally simple were the\r\nstrongest arguments used in its support. The actual metal in a\r\npenny was worth perhaps the tenth of a penny. There was a startling\r\ndifference between the face value and the bullion value of the nickel.\r\nEven the silver coins if offered as metal in the open market would\r\nfetch less than half the amount that they called for. Eventually, if\r\nmore and more of these “tokens of value” were issued, the people would\r\nrefuse to accept them except far below par. The time to stop such\r\ndepreciation was before it had begun, the supporters of the measure in\r\nboth houses declared, and there was none to gainsay them. Those who had\r\nalways opposed the greenback theory could not consistently oppose this\r\nline of reasoning. So the bill in its transition into law met little\r\nopposition.\r\n\r\nStrange to say, the newspapers, not even the tragedy-shrieking,\r\nsensation-making, scandal-hunting ones, saw aught in the Fractional\r\nCurrency Bill to make it worth more than a casual mention. What was\r\nsaid about it was good. One or two of the Far West publications who had\r\nviewed with dismay the gradually increasing number of pennies in their\r\nvicinity, welcomed it openly and gladly, for they felt that it would\r\navert the possibility of reducing their prices to the one, two or three\r\ncent standard of the East. The Eastern newspapers that had been cutting\r\neach other’s throats by selling twelve and sixteen pages of printed\r\nmatter at less than the cost of the white paper itself, saw in the\r\nmeasure, if as predicted it resulted in the gradual withdrawal of the\r\npenny from circulation, a chance to demand and receive a higher price\r\nfor their issues without being hurt by the lower prices of rivals.\r\nNaturally, the newspapers did not oppose the measure.\r\n\r\nAs for the people—what do the American people, individually, know or\r\ncare what is done in Washington? For the most part the knowledge of\r\nthe community at large is confined to what it reads of the doings of\r\nCongress in the Washington letters and to the criticisms it sees in\r\nits pet editorial columns. If nothing is said about a particular bill,\r\nthe public knows nothing. Merchants, bankers, shipping interests,\r\nrailroads, labor unions, are aroused to action only when they see in\r\na bill an attempt to work injury to themselves. In the case of the\r\nFractional Currency Bill those who knew of it saw nothing in it likely\r\nto injure them, and so there was no opposition.\r\n\r\nThus it was that the bill prohibiting the issue of the fractional\r\ncurrency of the United States for a period of five years from the\r\nfifteenth day of September received the signature of the President and\r\nwas duly recorded among the laws of the nation.\r\n\r\nSeven o’clock in the morning of the first Friday in October found Tom\r\nConnors at his desk in his offices on the second floor of the Safe\r\nDeposit Building. He had rented a suite of rooms there several months\r\nbefore and had put on the door the simple sign, “Thomas E. Connors,\r\nBroker.” There was nothing unusual about the appearance of the office.\r\nIn the anteroom there were a few chairs, a table and an office-boy.\r\nIn another room a leased wire was run in and a telegraph operator was\r\nseated. In the office of the “broker” himself there were only such\r\nparaphernalia as might be found in any broker’s office.\r\n\r\nEven in an inner room there was hardly anything to arouse suspicion.\r\nSome persons might have wondered a little if they had noticed that what\r\nwas to all appearances a door of a coat-closet in reality opened on a\r\nsecret staircase that led directly to the floor below and into one of\r\nthe strong rooms of the Safe Deposit Company of which Mr. Martin, the\r\nbanker, was president.\r\n\r\nIt was not very many minutes after the arrival of his employer that the\r\noffice-boy realized to his regret that Friday was to be almost as busy\r\na day for him as the day before had been. Ordinarily, he had had plenty\r\nof time to read his favorite literature, interrupted perhaps by a dozen\r\ncallers and half a dozen errands to do, but on Thursday he had observed\r\nsorrowfully that Mr. Connors’s clients seemed to be increasing. If he\r\nhad kept count he might have known that no less and no more than one\r\nhundred persons had called on Mr. Connors. Mr. Connors saw all of them.\r\nSome of them he saw alone. Others were admitted to his room by twos and\r\nthrees. In one instance ten men entered the inner office and emerged\r\nfrom it twenty minutes later in a body. But what all those men were\r\ndoing there was not of half so much interest to the office-boy as was\r\nthe fate of Daredevil Mike, whom the end of the chapter had left facing\r\nthe muzzles of seven rifles in the hands of seven desperate moonshiners.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the office-boy’s respect for Mr. Connors’s callers would have\r\nbeen increased had he known that each of the men when he left the\r\noffice had a package of one-dollar bills. There was not one of them\r\nthat had not at least $100; others had as much as $500. There was not\r\none of them that Mr. Connors did not know was to be trusted thoroughly.\r\nThe men were carefully selected. Some of them on previous occasions\r\nduring political campaigns had been supplied with money by Mr. Connors\r\nto be distributed in the places where it would do the most good. A few\r\nof them were not unknown in the records of crime, but as Mr. Connors\r\nhad remarked to Martin, the banker, to whom he had shown the list,\r\n“There ain’t one of them that would throw down a friend.”\r\n\r\nOne of these men had arrived in the office shortly after Mr. Connors,\r\nand as soon as he was admitted to the private office and the door had\r\nbeen shut, he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n“Say, Connors, that was a regular cinch. It did not take me more than\r\nan hour to clean up that market. No explanations had to be made,\r\neither.”\r\n\r\n“Where’s the stuff?” asked Mr. Connors bruskly, and Mullins, his\r\ncaller, began emptying on the desk from every pocket in his clothing a\r\nvaried assortment of small change.\r\n\r\n“You’ll find there’s ninety-five dollars there all right, as per\r\nagreement,” said Mullins. “I didn’t have to spend much over a dollar,\r\neither. It was a package of tobacco here and some potatoes for the old\r\nwoman there, where some old codger wouldn’t give me change unless I\r\nbought something. But in most cases I would go to a stall and tell them\r\na neighbor wanted five dollars in small change till the bank opened,\r\nand nearly every time I would get it. I don’t believe there’s a hundred\r\npennies left in that market.”\r\n\r\nWhile he had been talking a clerk from the Safe Deposit Company had\r\nentered Mr. Connors’s office by the private staircase. He carried to\r\nthe room below the money Mullins had turned in, returning shortly with\r\ntwo receipt slips, one of which went to Mr. Connors and the other to\r\nhis caller.\r\n\r\n“Now, Mullins,” said Mr. Connors, “I want you to go up to the big\r\ncable-car barn where the conductors turn in their money. Here’s $500\r\nmore, and stay there until you are relieved. If you run out of money\r\ntelephone me. Get in some inconspicuous corner and pass the word around\r\namong the conductors that ninety-five pennies or nineteen nickels are\r\nworth a dollar to you. If they want to know what is up tell them that\r\nit is a theatrical advertising dodge; tell them that you are writing a\r\nstory for a Sunday newspaper—tell them anything.”\r\n\r\nHardly had Mullins been dismissed when another of the syndicate’s\r\nagents came in to report and was hurried off to some other part of the\r\ncity. In some cases the men received an allowance of five per cent. on\r\nall the money they handled. In other cases it was a little more. So the\r\nwork went on all that day and the next. Ten men were kept at work in\r\nten sections of the city seeing that paper money replaced the silver,\r\nnickels and coppers in the tills of the small shops. Few, if any, of\r\nthe shopkeepers realized that anything was amiss. The agents were all\r\ninstructed to do their work without arousing any suspicion. They had\r\norders every time they rode on a surface-car or patronized the Elevated\r\nroads to offer a dollar bill in payment of their fare. Wherever they\r\nsaw an opportunity to get a bill changed they took it.\r\n\r\nA clerk of the Safe Deposit Company reported at noon to Mr. Connors\r\nthat 12,071,624 pennies, 437,589 nickels, 366,427 dimes, 444,886\r\nquarters and 139,553 half-dollars had been turned in by the assiduous\r\ncollectors. Telegrams received from Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago and\r\nvarious other cities showed that the efforts there had met with equal\r\nsuccess. With the $3,000,000 in small change that Mr. Connors had\r\nsucceeded in amassing in the preceding weeks through banks and money\r\nbrokers, he was well satisfied.\r\n\r\nAt three o’clock on Friday afternoon there was not a bank in the city\r\nthat had not had its store of small change much depleted by the raids\r\nof the dry-goods and department stores. Half an hour later an organized\r\ndescent was made on all the big department stores by the agents of the\r\nsyndicate. Ninety of the collectors—the others being still engaged\r\nelsewhere, according to orders previously issued, their movements being\r\nknown only to Mr. Tom Connors—visited in succession the biggest stores\r\nin the shopping district, making in various departments a series of\r\npurchases of articles advertised at four cents or six cents, or some\r\nother small sum that meant at least ninety cents in change from a\r\ndollar bill. When Friday evening came the syndicate had succeeded in\r\nstripping the shopping district of all its small change.\r\n\r\nThe work of collecting on Saturday was necessarily much slower, but\r\nwhen Saturday evening came the syndicate had nearly $9,000,000 in\r\nfractional currency in its possession and everyone was wondering what\r\nmade change so scarce. The grand _coup_ was effected at midnight\r\nSaturday night. Agents of the syndicate were waiting with paper money\r\nat the headquarters of all the penny-in-the-slot machines. More than a\r\nmillion dollars, mostly of pennies, was hurried in guarded trucks to\r\nthe Safe Deposit offices.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday afternoon there was another conference in the Senator’s\r\nrooms. Connors submitted his report. He told how the markets,\r\nthe car-barns, the “L” stations, the department stores, the\r\nfive-and-ten-cent shops had been skilfully but legally looted of all\r\ntheir small change. Not only in one city but in all cities of over\r\nten thousand inhabitants had this been done successfully. There was\r\ntriumph in his tones as he read the final figures: “Cost of collection,\r\n$482,621. Total small change in vaults, $9,464,867.63.”\r\n\r\nThe Senator smiled a satisfied smile.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” said he, “I think we can safely say that our corner is\r\ncomplete. We have cornered the small change. The department stores, the\r\nstreet railways, business everywhere will be at a standstill tomorrow.\r\nSmall change is essential to modern business. The business men must\r\nhave it. They must come to _us_ for it. If business stops for a single\r\nday, there is hardly a large establishment that can survive. We have\r\nthem at our mercy! How merciful we are to be, Mr. Martin, I think we\r\nshould leave to you.”\r\n\r\nThe others nodded assent.\r\n\r\nMr. Martin adjusted his glasses. He took Mr. Connors’s report and\r\nglanced at it with deliberation.\r\n\r\n“As the Senator observed,” he began, “the retail business houses must\r\nhave small change. They must have pennies. Even on Saturday afternoon\r\nthey were trying to get them. They were offering premiums. As high as\r\nsix dollars was offered for five dollars in pennies. By Monday noon,\r\nwith disaster, with suspension, with failure before them, they will\r\ngladly pay any price for small change.”\r\n\r\n“But, gentlemen”—the banker smiled a philanthropic smile—“we must be\r\ngenerous. We can offer the retailers liberal terms—we can offer them\r\nall the small change they want for immediate delivery by Monday noon.\r\nWe can make the terms seven dollars for five dollars in small change.\r\nFrom what I know of the conditions, I am confident that all the small\r\nchange we have amassed will be gladly taken at that price. We have on\r\nhand in round numbers nine and one-half millions. For this we will\r\nreceive $13,300,000. Deducting our capital, and the half million that\r\nit cost us for collection, this will still leave us $2,800,000, or\r\nsomething more than a half million apiece after Mr. Connors has had his\r\ntenth.”\r\n\r\nMonday dawned bright and clear, and Mr. Martin was early in reaching\r\nhis office at the Safe Deposit Company. So was Mr. Connors. The last\r\nthing on Saturday night circulars had been mailed to all the principal\r\nretailers and to the street railway companies announcing that the Safe\r\nDeposit Company was prepared to supply an unlimited amount of small\r\nchange on short notice.\r\n\r\n“The street-cars caught it hard this morning,” whispered Mr. Connors as\r\nhe dropped downstairs for a moment to see how things were going. “How\r\nare things progressing? Any answers to the circulars yet?”\r\n\r\nMr. Martin shook his head, but he glanced at the clock.\r\n\r\n“It’s too early,” he said. “It’ll take them an hour or two to realize\r\nwhat a bad situation they are in.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose it will,” said Connors as he went upstairs to send out\r\nscouts.\r\n\r\nAn hour later he was back downstairs in Mr. Martin’s office. The\r\nSenator was there, too. Both he and Martin looked worried.\r\n\r\n“Say,” said Connors, “something’s gone wrong somewhere. The department\r\nstores seem to be doing business the same as ever. And there’s pennies\r\neverywhere!”\r\n\r\n“That’s just what the Senator was telling me,” said Mr. Martin, with a\r\npuzzled air.\r\n\r\n“Well, where in blazes are all the pennies coming from?” demanded\r\nConnors angrily.\r\n\r\n“That is just what Mr. Martin and I expected you to tell us!” said the\r\nSenator severely. “Did you clean out all the small change from the\r\nmarkets?”\r\n\r\n“And from the department stores?” echoed the banker.\r\n\r\n“And from the car-barns?”\r\n\r\n“And from the five-and-ten-cent stores?”\r\n\r\n“And from the slot machines?”\r\n\r\n“And from the children’s banks?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and from a thousand places more!” said Connors.\r\n\r\n“How about the churches?” asked the Senator slowly.\r\n\r\nAll three looked blank. They understood now why the corner had failed.\r\n\r\nFor everybody knows that, no matter what happens, there are always\r\nplenty of pennies in the church collection plates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   _Car Straps as Disease Spreaders_\r\n\r\n\r\n                       BY JOHN H. GIRDNER, M.D.\r\n\r\nThe leather straps in the street-cars of New York and all other cities,\r\nto which people have to hang when unable to get a seat, are not only\r\nunmentionably filthy, but they are a means of spreading disease. Each\r\none of these straps is a focus of infection, a continual repository and\r\nsource of supply of every kind of disease germ and about every kind of\r\nfilth known to mankind. These car straps are made of leather. They are\r\nriveted around the pole from which they hang, when the car is built,\r\nand there they remain until they or the car are worn out. They are\r\nnever removed to be cleaned or disinfected. And they are never renewed\r\nuntil the old one is rotten from age and use. Thousands upon thousands\r\nof all sorts and conditions of people, hailing from everywhere and with\r\nevery imaginable variety of filth and infection befouling their hands\r\nand fingers, grasp these straps at all hours of the day and night.\r\n\r\nSome idea of the conglomeration of materials which these thousands of\r\nhands deposit, remove and mix up on the car straps might safely be left\r\nto the imagination. Microscopic examination of scrapings taken from\r\nstraps in use on cars in New York City has revealed infectious material\r\nand filth of all kinds. Cultures made from these scrapings and injected\r\ninto guinea pigs caused their death in a few hours.\r\n\r\nCar straps may readily be the means of conveying the virus of some\r\nof the most loathsome diseases, especially those attended with a\r\ndischarge, or where there are open ulcers or eruption on the skin. In\r\ntraveling about the city people hold on to the car straps from a few\r\nminutes to half an hour. The perspiration of the hand moistens the\r\nleather and whatever of filth or virus happens to be on the hand is\r\nliterally soaked into the strap and there it remains until another\r\nhand comes along and carries some of it away or makes another deposit\r\nof similar character or both. It is true that the skin everywhere, and\r\nespecially the thick skin on the hands, is an excellent protection\r\nagainst poisonous material brought into contact with it, otherwise man\r\ncould not live at all. Here is a good example of what is meant: You\r\nmight cover your entire arm with vaccine virus and it would not “take”\r\nif the entire skin was intact, but scratch it ever so little, making a\r\nsmall raw spot, and the virus enters the system and you have all the\r\nsymptoms of a successful vaccination. So it is in handling straps which\r\nhave been handled by others with virus of any kind on their hands; if\r\nthere are no raw or sore places on your hand you are not in danger,\r\nbut a slight abrasion, a cut or hang-nail may be sufficient to cause\r\ninfection, as happened to a patient of mine only recently.\r\n\r\nThere is another danger: virus on the hand may be carried to the eyes\r\nby the fingers and cause mischief when there is no abrasion on the hand\r\nto admit it to the system.\r\n\r\nAside from the dangers pointed out, there is the esthetic side. It is\r\nfar from pleasant to hold on to one of these straps if one stops to\r\nthink what may be, and what certainly is, on the strap. You can put on\r\ngloves; but it is not even pleasant to think of wallowing one’s gloves\r\nin such material.\r\n\r\nYou cannot disinfect leather without destroying it; even if these\r\nleather straps could be removed from the poles. Here is the remedy:\r\nUse straps made of webbing instead of leather, and attach them to the\r\npoles with a device which would make it possible to remove the straps\r\nreadily. Remove the straps at proper intervals, once a month or so,\r\nand thoroughly disinfect them with heat and formaldehyde. They will\r\ncome out of this thoroughly cleaned and without injury to the strap\r\nitself. Webbing straps are stronger than leather. Tests made at Brown\r\nUniversity of the comparative tensile strength of the two materials\r\nshowed that, while leather straps of the regulation kind broke under\r\n400 or 500 pounds, it took 600 and 700 pounds to break webbing straps.\r\nThe webbing strap is also more pleasant to grasp in the hand than\r\nleather.\r\n\r\nEvery argument is in favor of substituting webbing for leather as\r\nmaterial for car straps except the small item of expense to the\r\ncompanies of making the change. The cost of disinfecting them from time\r\nto time would be trifling. The president of the Board of Health of New\r\nYork City has, in fact, expressed his willingness to disinfect the\r\nstraps free of charge to the companies, if they will bring the straps\r\nto the department’s disinfecting plant at such intervals as he shall\r\ndesignate.\r\n\r\nSpitting in cars is properly prohibited because there is some danger\r\nof spreading tuberculosis by this means. And it is also a practice\r\nrevolting to well-bred people. As a means of conveying the germs of a\r\nnumber of loathsome diseases, the present car straps are more dangerous\r\nthan is spitting on the floor. And it is certainly revolting to a man\r\nor woman of ordinary habits of cleanliness to be obliged to hang on to\r\na piece of leather which is so filthy that one would not touch it under\r\nany other circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _His Profanitaciturnity_\r\n\r\n\r\n“Deacon Timothy Tush is a man of few words,” said the landlord of the\r\nPruntytown tavern, “but he makes ’em count.\r\n\r\n“Of course, it was aggravating enough to have caused ’most anybody\r\nto indulge in any kind of language that came to hand, and plenty of\r\nit—to have the hired man cut up such a dido. To be sure, foolishness\r\nis bound up in the heart of a hired man; but Deacon Timothy’s hired\r\nman went further than the law allows when he attempted to smoke out a\r\nhornet’s nest up in the barn loft, with a skillet of live coals and\r\ntwo spoonfuls of sulphur; after, of course, having driven up with an\r\nox-cart of hay and clumb up into the loft and found the nest. Being a\r\nhired man, he couldn’t possibly act any other way.\r\n\r\n“He did exactly what might have been expected when a hornet stung him\r\non the neck; he jumped backward, stuck his foot through a rotten board\r\nand flung the live coals in every direction. The Deacon was coming\r\nalong with old Juckett, the horse doctor, just as the hired man tumbled\r\nout of the loft door, considerably afire and literally infested with\r\nhornets, and landed on the load of hay, setting fire to that, too. The\r\noxen ran over the Deacon and old Juckett, scattered burning hay ’most\r\neverywhere, tore the cart to flinders, and would have burnt up the\r\nwhole place if it hadn’t been for the neighbors.\r\n\r\n“As it was, barn, cart and load of hay were totally destroyed, the oxen\r\nsinged, the Deacon sadly battered, old Juckett’s left leg broken, and\r\nthe hired man so unanimously stung and fried that the doctor said he\r\nreally didn’t know where to begin on him. And—but, let’s see! Where\r\nwas I? Oh, yes! All the Deacon said when it happened was ‘Suzz! suzz!’\r\nbut I can’t help thinking it was the most profane suzzing I ever had\r\nthe pleasure of listening to.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   _The Say of Reform Editors_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Reform editor is a political waif on the tempestuous sea of strife.\r\n\r\nIt would have been money in his pocket if he had never been born.\r\n\r\nHe has a devil part of the time, and a devil of a time all the time.\r\n\r\nThe smallest thing about him is his pocketbook and the largest his\r\ndelinquent list.\r\n\r\nHe says more kind things of other people and gets more “cussings” than\r\nany other man living.\r\n\r\nWhen he first takes the job of reforming the world he thinks it can be\r\nfinished in six months or a year.\r\n\r\nThen he puts it off another year and borrows some money of his\r\nfather-in-law.\r\n\r\nThen he enlists for three years or more during the war and borrows some\r\nmore money.\r\n\r\nAt this stage of the game he takes a new grip on the situation and\r\nstarts in to finish up the job in the next campaign.\r\n\r\nBut a cog slips and the dadgummed thing slides merrily down the broad\r\nroad to destruction.\r\n\r\nThe editor tears his hair and says some cuss words.\r\n\r\nThe devil grins and throws the shooting-stick at the office cat.\r\n\r\nEvery opposition paper trots out its rooster, and the editor waits for\r\nthe world to come to an end or the moon to turn to blood.\r\n\r\nAt this point in the proceedings it is time to borrow some more money.\r\n\r\nHe would quit business, but he can’t.\r\n\r\nWhen a man undertakes to reform the world he is never out of a job.\r\n\r\nHe always sees something that needs his attention.\r\n\r\nBut the Reform editor is made of the right kind of metal.\r\n\r\nHe is always out of money, but seldom out of heart.\r\n\r\nHe used to dream of the time when he could bathe his wearied feet in\r\nthe rippling waters of success.\r\n\r\nWhen every man would do unto his brother as he would have his brother\r\nto do unto him.\r\n\r\nWhen in Utopia’s green fields and by the side of its babbling brooks he\r\ncould end his days.\r\n\r\nBut he is over that now.\r\n\r\nAll he can do is to attract some attention and set the people to\r\nthinking.\r\n\r\nHere’s to the Reform editor.\r\n\r\nHe may have chosen a rough and tempestuous road, but the lightning\r\nstrokes of his gifted pen and thunder tones of his voice will purify\r\nthe moral and political atmosphere.—_Morgan’s Buzz Saw._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“A READER of _The Commoner_ asks where he can secure a copy of\r\na book entitled ‘Ten Men on Money Isle.’ If anyone who is able to give\r\nthe information will send it to _The Commoner_ on a postal card the\r\ninformation will be published for the benefit of the readers.”\r\n\r\nAnd the foregoing from Bryan’s _Commoner_!\r\n\r\n“Ten Men on Money Isle” is one of Colonel S.

To be sure, the party is in the strong clutch of greed, as\r\nmuch so as the Democratic party was in 1850, but the Whig party had\r\nthe good sense to die in 1854, and the Free Soil Democrats, the strong\r\nmen of the then dominant party, came out and formed the Republican\r\nparty, a party of the people, by the people and for the people. And\r\nthis party would have given us splendid service in economic reforms\r\nhad not the great Civil War required its attention; while the nation\r\nwas torn by this internecine struggle the vampires of greed, who have\r\nno politics, fastened themselves upon this grand new party, and long\r\nbefore peace came were so intrenched in power that such men as Lincoln,\r\nMorton, Wade, Stevens and a host of other great Republican leaders were\r\ncompelled to bow in submission.

There is\r\n          no other who traces so vividly the life of a _people_\r\n          from the time they were savages until they became the\r\n          most polite and cultured of European nations, as he\r\n          does in\r\n\r\n=THE STORY OF FRANCE=\r\n\r\n       In two handsome volumes, dark red cloth, gilt tops, price $5.00.\r\n\r\n            “It is well called a story, for it reads like a\r\n          fascinating romance.”—_Plaindealer_, Cleveland.\r\n\r\n            “A most brilliant, vigorous, human-hearted story\r\n          this: so broad in its sympathies, so vigorous in\r\n          its presentations, so vital, so piquant, lively and\r\n          interesting.

(Postage 20c.)\r\n\r\n            “The Splendid Study of a Splendid Genius” is the\r\n          caption of a double-column editorial mention of this\r\n          book in _The New York American and Journal_ when it\r\n          first appeared. The comment urged every reader of that\r\n          paper to read the book and continued:\r\n\r\n            “There does not live a man who will not be enlarged\r\n          in his thinking processes, there does not live a boy\r\n          who will not be made more ambitious by honest study of\r\n          Watson’s Napoleon * * *\r\n\r\n            “If you want the best obtainable, most readable, most\r\n          intelligent, most genuinely American study of this\r\n          great character, read Watson’s history of Napoleon.”\r\n\r\n=“TOM WATSON”=\r\n          in these books does far more than make history as\r\n          readable as a novel of the best sort.

They\r\n          are epoch-making books which every American should\r\n          read and own.\r\n\r\n             Orders for the above books will be filled by\r\n TOM WATSON’S MAGAZINE, 121 West 42nd Street, New York City.",
