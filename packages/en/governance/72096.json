It comprises the jottings and materials which\r\nI collected for a speech intended to be delivered on 28th May, when\r\nproposing a motion in favour of abolishing Patents for Inventions.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding imperfections in execution, the present compilation\r\nmay acceptably supply a _desideratum_ and prepare the way for further\r\ndiscussions, and especially for the Committee which Her Majesty’s\r\nGovernment continue to view with favour and will heartily support.\r\n\r\n                                                                  R. A. M.\r\n\r\n_June 9, 1869._\r\n\r\nWhile in the hands of the printer, fresh matter has, through the kindness\r\nof honoured fellow-workers in the cause, reached me almost daily, part of\r\nwhich is added. The reader will find in this accession to the testimonies\r\non behalf of freedom of industry, besides some new arguments, such a\r\nstriking concurrence and oneness in the principles enunciated, and even\r\nin the illustrations made use of, as, coming from various quarters\r\nindependently, may fairly be regarded as presumptive proof of their\r\naccuracy.\r\n\r\nThe Government has been so good as agree to produce, in conformity\r\nwith a request from Parliament, any documents in possession of the\r\nForeign-office which show the reasons or motives of the Prussian and\r\nDutch Governments for proposing the abolition of Patents in Germany and\r\nthe Netherlands. The adoption in the latter country of abolition pure\r\nand simple, without (so far as I can see) the slightest indication of a\r\nsubstitute, may well reconcile professional inventors and all who unite\r\nwith them to the propositions with which I close my “speech.” Now that\r\nthe continental stones are dropping out of the arch which forms the\r\nSystem of Patents, the rest cannot long keep their place. The antiquated\r\nfabric may be expected to tumble. For public safety, the sooner\r\nParliament and all concerned set themselves to take it down, the better.\r\n\r\nA communication from Professor Thorold Rogers, and remarks on a recent\r\nReview, are given herewith, the former on account of its value as\r\na vindication of economic truth and justice, the latter by way of\r\ncorrecting the reviewer’s accidental mistakes.\r\n\r\nThe _Daily News_, in a leading article on the 27th July, having attached\r\nimportance altogether undue to a small meeting called under peculiar\r\ncircumstances on the 24th, which was supposed to express opinions and\r\nwishes of artisans and operatives,[1] I addressed letters to that\r\ninfluential paper, which will be found in its issues of the 29th, 30th,\r\nand 31st. Of course Sir Roundell Palmer, who did the promoter of the\r\nmeeting the honour to take the chair, had not, any more than myself, the\r\nsmallest connexion with its origination and arrangements.\r\n\r\nAppended are suggestions and information regarding Copyright, which came\r\nin my way while in the press about Patent-right, and which may be useful\r\nif international negotiations are contemplated for one or other or both\r\nof these kindred subjects.\r\n\r\nI hope imperfections of translation, which I regret, and errors of\r\nthe press, for which I take blame without correcting them, will\r\nbe indulgently pardoned, as well as faults entirely my own in the\r\nunaccustomed part of advocate and compiler.\r\n\r\n_July 31._\r\n\r\n⁂ No rights are reserved. Mr. Macfie will be glad to be favoured, at\r\nAshfield Hall, Neston, Chester, with a copy of any transcripts made or\r\nany printed matter illustrating the question of Patents.\r\n\r\n[1] When members of “Inventors’ Associations” ask mechanics to join\r\na crusade against freedom of industry, the best rejoinder is to ask\r\na statement in writing to show how it can be for the interest of the\r\nmillions to perpetuate fetters for the sake of investing a few hundred\r\nindividuals with a chance of obtaining personal advantage by means of the\r\npower of fettering.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM PROFESSOR THOROLD ROGERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,—.... The fact is, no one, I presume, wishes to say that an\r\ninventor is undeserving and should go unrewarded. All that the opponents\r\nof the Patent system do say is, that the present machinery gives the\r\nminimum advantage to the inventor, and inflicts the maximum disadvantage\r\non the public. Besides, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, the\r\npatentee is only a simultaneous inventor with a number of others, who\r\nlose their labour and ingenuity because one man happens to get in\r\nfirst....\r\n\r\nIt has always seemed to me that the weakness of the inventor’s case lies\r\nin the fact already alluded to, that he rarely is the sole inventor.\r\nHence the fundamental distinction between Invention and Copyright, though\r\nI am no fanatical admirer of the latter privilege.\r\n\r\nNow, if a law can confer a right on one person only by inflicting a wrong\r\non a number of other persons, it is intrinsically vicious, and cannot be\r\ndefended on the ground of its intentional goodness.\r\n\r\n                            Yours faithfully,\r\n\r\n                                                  JAMES C. THOROLD ROGERS.\r\n\r\nJuly 29.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS ON A RECENT ARTICLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Westminster Review_ for July contains an article on Patents. Its\r\nproofs should have been corrected with more care. In my answer to\r\nquestion 1947 in the Royal Commission’s Report, the word “patented” in\r\nthe following the _Review_ misprints “neglected:”—\r\n\r\n    As a matter of fact, patentees have patented things of so\r\n    little value.\r\n\r\nAnd in question 1954 a worse mistake is made by substituting “_some_” for\r\n“none” in the following:—\r\n\r\n    There being 400 Patents now in existence affecting your trade,\r\n    none of which are made use of by you.\r\n\r\nI have right also to complain of mistakes which do not originate with the\r\nprinter. The following opinions and arguments imputed to me I disclaim:—\r\n\r\n    Had Mr. Macfie said this, we should not have been surprised.\r\n    It closely resembles his contention that a book should be\r\n    protected because it is something tangible, whereas an\r\n    invention is something which, if not invisible, is in the\r\n    nebulous condition of an idea.\r\n\r\nWhat I wrote will be found below, page 241. My argument is, that the\r\nsubjects of Copyright being tangible _can_ be identified as the author’s\r\nproduction, and nobody else’s; and that the subjects of Patent-right\r\nbeing modes or plans, belong to the region of ideas which may easily\r\noccur to anybody besides the first inventor.\r\n\r\nAgain: the reviewer says of Lord Stanley:—\r\n\r\n    The latter, while supporting Mr. Macfie on the main issue\r\n    distinctly repudiated his leading arguments.\r\n\r\nThis would be strange if true, seeing I coincide in all his Lordship’s\r\narguments. How, then, can he, twelve pages further on, say again:—\r\n\r\n    As for Lord Stanley, he did not hesitate to dissent from Mr.\r\n    Macfie’s arguments, while giving a qualified support to his\r\n    motion.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I should object to the following representation:—\r\n\r\n    It has been proposed to replace Letters Patent by grants from\r\n    the national purse. This is to revert to an obsolete custom.\r\n    During the eighteenth century it was fairly tried, and the\r\n    result should serve as a warning now. Seventy thousand pounds\r\n    were distributed among plausible inventors in the course\r\n    of fifty years. The advantage to the public was _nil_. The\r\n    encouragement given to impostors was the only tangible result.\r\n    Johanna Stephens obtained 5,000_l._ for disclosing the secret\r\n    of her cure for the stone. A Mr. Blake got 2,500_l._ to assist\r\n    him in perfecting his scheme for transporting fish to London by\r\n    land, while a Mr. Foden was greatly overpaid with 500_l._, “to\r\n    enable him to prosecute a discovery made by him of a paste as a\r\n    substitute for wheat-flour.” Give a man a sum of money for his\r\n    invention, and you run the risk of paying him either too much\r\n    or too little. Give him a Patent, and you secure the invention\r\n    for the public, while his remuneration in money is absolutely\r\n    determined according to its value.\r\n\r\nThe _system_ of State-rewards has _not_ been tried. The reviewer’s\r\ncases do not apply. The scheme that I submit could never be abused so\r\nas to sanction such follies. It may not be a generous and royal way of\r\ndealing with inventions, but it is equitable and safe; whereas, _pace_\r\nthe reviewer, the remuneration from a Patent is not at all “determined\r\naccording to its value” (that of the invention).\r\n\r\nThis interesting article is remarkable for what it omits rather than\r\nwhat it contains. Like almost every, if not every, defence of Patents\r\nwhich I have seen, it ignores the grand objection to Patents—their\r\nincompatibility with free-trade. From the beginning to the end there is\r\nnot in the article the slightest allusion to the hardship they inflict on\r\nBritish manufacturers in competing with rivals in home, and especially\r\nin foreign, markets. Reformers of the Patent system fail to realise\r\nthis—that no conceivable mere _improvement_, even, though it should clear\r\naway the present encumbrance of a multiplicity of trifling Patents, can\r\nbe more than an _alleviation_ of the mischief now done. The remaining\r\nfew would be the most important and valuable ones, and therefore the\r\nmost burdensome, because those which, on account of the heavy royalties\r\nthat will be legally claimed, must subject British manufacturers to the\r\nlargest pecuniary exactions—exactions that they cannot, but their rivals\r\noften would, escape.\r\n\r\nThe writer of the article has a way of pooh-poohing adverse arguments,\r\neven when he mentions them.\r\n\r\n    That no two men produce the same book is true. It is almost\r\n    as difficult for two men to give to the world two inventions\r\n    identical in every detail, and equally well-fitted to subserve\r\n    the same end. Much has been said about the ease with which this\r\n    may be done, but authentic proofs are lacking of this having\r\n    been done on a large scale.\r\n\r\nAnd\r\n\r\n    Again, then, we ask for proofs of the allegation that six men\r\n    are often on the track of the self-same invention.\r\n\r\nWhy, the simultaneousness, or rapid succession, of identical inventions\r\nis notorious.\r\n\r\nHe goes in the face of the strongest evidence when he says—\r\n\r\n    It is doubtful even if these objectionable Patents do any real\r\n    harm. An invention which will answer no purpose is simply\r\n    useless, whether it be patented or not.\r\n\r\nAnd, elsewhere,\r\n\r\n    The truth must not be blinked that, if a multiplicity of\r\n    worthless Patents be an evil, if the profits of manufacturers\r\n    are diminished owing to the battle they have to fight with\r\n    patentees, if the bestowal of Patent-right be the source of\r\n    mischief and the occasion of pecuniary loss, the like complaint\r\n    may be laid at the door of Copyright, and its abolition might\r\n    be demanded with as great a show of fairness.\r\n\r\nHow lightly he can regard arguments of his opponents is also seen in the\r\nfollowing passage:—\r\n\r\n    Another of Lord Stanley’s objections is that the right man\r\n    hardly ever gets the reward. As he puts it, litigation being\r\n    costly, and the grant of Patent-right merely amounting to\r\n    permission to take legal proceedings against infringers, the\r\n    poor man has no chance of asserting and defending his rights.\r\n    “If a poor inventor took out a Patent, and the Patent promised\r\n    to be productive, in nine cases out of ten he was obliged to\r\n    sell it to some one who could command capital enough to defend\r\n    it in a court of law.” We submit this proves nothing more than\r\n    that the poor inventor, in nine cases out of ten, deserves our\r\n    pity. But then, if these nine inventors are unfortunate, that\r\n    does not justify the ill-treatment of the tenth.\r\n\r\nThe source of the writer’s idea, that cessation of Patents is\r\nill-treatment, lies in the assumption which pervades the whole article,\r\nthat to inventors belongs property in inventions—_i.e._, _exclusive_\r\nright of property; or, in other words, right to require the State to use\r\nits power to prevent other persons from doing what they do, and what\r\nevery other man has a natural and inalienable right to do.\r\n\r\nStill further: shutting his eyes to the difficulty of mollifying the\r\ngrievance of invention monopoly by means of “_compulsory licences_,”\r\nwhich the Royal Commission declared they found no way of rendering\r\npracticable—and, I add, if practicable, would be no cure of the evils,\r\nwhich are radical—he writes—\r\n\r\n    If to this were added a system of compulsory licences, the\r\n    amount of royalty to be determined by a tribunal, in the event\r\n    of the parties failing to come to terms, nearly all the really\r\n    serious and valid objections to the working of a Patent-Law\r\n    would be obviated.\r\n\r\nYet, believing himself the friend of _the public_, in spite of all the\r\nstrong arguments _against_ his views and the little he himself adduces\r\n_for_ them, he very complacently tells us—\r\n\r\n    Speaking on behalf of the public, we maintain that a Patent-Law\r\n    is necessary in any uncivilised community, because, without its\r\n    protection, industry cannot flourish, and ingenuity can have no\r\n    scope for its triumphs.\r\n\r\nThe reviewer can hardly have consulted any practical man when he\r\npronounces it—\r\n\r\n    absurd to plead that a Patent has been infringed in ignorance,\r\n    when it is certain that the ignorance, if not wilful, is wholly\r\n    inexcusable.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, infringements often are not acts done blamelessly in\r\nignorance; still, I would be surprised in most cases if the infringer\r\nknew he was infringing. He is not likely to know it in making trivial\r\nimprovements, for how can he know without subjecting himself to no small\r\ntrouble and expense, such as ought not to be laid upon him.\r\n\r\nThere is an important point as to which the reviewer and I perhaps\r\ndiffer, “the extent to which Letters Patent give a monopoly in ideas.”\r\nThe fact is, that the whole breadth of a _principle_ is patentable,\r\nprovided any single mode of applying it can be specified.\r\n\r\nThe reviewer, adverting to the changes which have taken place in the Law\r\nof Patents since the days of Elizabeth, characterises them as “changes\r\ntowards greater freedom of action on the part of the State, and greater\r\nliberty of choice on the part of the people.” This, I confess, I do not\r\nunderstand, except so far as it may mean there has been less and less\r\ncontrol exercised by the State, and more and more advantage taken of this\r\nsupineness by all sorts of persons. I am quite prepared to admit that in\r\nmy speech I have exhibited rather a popular than a strictly legal and\r\nlogical view of the meaning and legitimate applicability of the words\r\nin the statute, “nor mischievous to the State by raising prices.” All\r\nthat I maintain is this,—that the spirit of the proviso is opposed to\r\nany individual Patent that keeps prices up at a level below which, if\r\nthere were no grant, they might, by the natural progress of industry,\r\nbe expected to fall, and to a Patent system that characteristically has\r\nthat effect and is also chargeable with “hurt of trade” and “generally\r\ninconvenient.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECHES AND PAPERS ON THE ABOLITION OF PATENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following petition, which Mr. Macfie had the honour to present,\r\ncontains the motion which gave occasion for the speeches that form the\r\nprincipal part of this compilation:—\r\n\r\n    _To the Honourable the Commons of the United Kingdom of Great\r\n    Britain and Ireland in Parliament assembled._\r\n\r\n    THE PETITION OF THE NEWCASTLE AND GATESHEAD CHAMBER OF COMMERCE\r\n\r\n    Humbly sheweth,—\r\n\r\n    That your petitioners have had many opportunities of\r\n    becoming acquainted with the working of the laws under which\r\n    Patent-rights are granted to inventors in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\n    That your petitioners are informed that notice has been given\r\n    in your honourable House of a motion in the following words:—\r\n\r\n        “That in the opinion of this House the time has\r\n        arrived when the interests of trade and commerce,\r\n        and the progress of the arts and sciences in this\r\n        country, would be promoted by the abolition of\r\n        Patents for inventions.”\r\n\r\n    That your petitioners, believing the proposed total abolition\r\n    of Patent-Laws will be of great benefit to the country, are\r\n    most desirous that the above-named resolution should be adopted\r\n    by your honourable House.\r\n\r\n    Your petitioners, therefore, humbly pray that the said motion\r\n    may pass your honourable House.\r\n\r\n    And your petitioners will ever pray, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES OF SPEECH OF MR. MACFIE, M.P.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Macfie, after apologies founded partly on the circumstance that, so\r\nfar as he knew, this was the first occasion when the policy of granting\r\nPatents for Inventions had been discussed in Parliament, proceeded to\r\nsay, that manufacturers could not be indifferent to improvements. It is\r\nindeed significant that they do dislike Patents, while they appreciate\r\nand honour inventors, even those inventors who claim from the State\r\nexclusive privileges, some of whom have the glory of being among the\r\ngreatest benefactors of mankind.\r\n\r\nIn considering the important subject which he now brought forward, he\r\nsubmitted that it is not the interest of inventors, nor even the interest\r\nof manufacturers, of agriculturists, of miners, nor of shipping, that\r\nthis House should consult, but those of the nation. The question to be\r\nconsidered is, do Patents, on the whole, promote our national welfare?\r\n\r\nAnother principle on which he proceeded is, that there can be no property\r\nin ideas. The Creator has so constituted nature that ideas can be held in\r\ncommon, which is not the case with things material. Letters Patent for\r\ninventions have been instituted in order to confirm to certain persons,\r\nand deprive every other person of, the common, natural right to act on\r\nthe ideas or knowledge there patented. These exclusive privileges, while\r\nthey last, are, of course, property.\r\n\r\nFurther: It is a recognised principle, that the State is not bound to\r\ngrant Patents. These are grants dictated by royal favour. In the words of\r\nStephens’ Commentaries: “The grant of a Patent-right is not _ex debito\r\njustitiæ_, but an act of royal favour.” Every Patent is a voluntary\r\ntransference by the State to an individual of power for fourteen years\r\nto tax at pleasure other persons for making or doing the thing patented;\r\naye, if he likes, to prohibit or withhold the thing altogether.\r\n\r\nPatent-right must not be confounded with Copyright. The latter stands\r\non perfectly different grounds, and can be advocated and upheld, as\r\nhe (Mr. Macfie) himself does, in perfect consistency with disfavour\r\nfor the former. There can be no rival claimant to the authorship of\r\nany particular book; many persons may honestly and indisputably claim\r\noriginality in an invention. The true similarity between these two\r\nsubjects of privilege is not between the book and the invention or\r\nmachine, but the book and the specification of the invention. When you\r\nbuy a Murray’s handbook, a book on medicine, or a commercial guide, you\r\nare at liberty to act on information you find in it, and to travel,\r\ntrade, or prescribe, according to the directions you find there. But mark\r\nthe contrast in what Patent-Law creates. When you buy a specification,\r\nyou know it tells only of certain things that you are not at liberty to\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nLastly: I acknowledge that it is legitimate to legislate with a view to\r\npromote or protect trade. The interference, however, which is now wanted\r\nis not a return to the old protective system of discriminative duties,\r\nbut the clearing away of evil laws, and especially deliverance from the\r\nbondage and wrongs involved in Patent monopolies.\r\n\r\nFor the origin of our definite Patent legislation we go back to the\r\nfamous statute of James I. of England. At that time the people of this\r\nkingdom were in a state somewhat resembling our present state. They\r\nwere desirous to extend trade and introduce new arts and manufactures.\r\nParliament was powerful and hated monopolies, under which the people\r\nhad been writhing. These it reprobated in the spirit of the jurists of\r\nantiquity. While by that statute it swept away all other monopolies, it\r\npermitted, or tolerated, that the Crown should grant the exceptional\r\nprivilege for “the sole working or making of any manner of new\r\nmanufactures within this realm, to the true and first inventor and\r\ninventors of such manufactures, which others at the time of making such\r\nLetters Patent and grants shall not use, so as also they be not contrary\r\nto the law nor mischievous to the State, by raising prices of commodities\r\nat home or hurt of trade or generally inconvenient.”\r\n\r\nThe House will keep steadily in view the wholly different condition of\r\ncommerce and the arts at that time. When these monopolies were spared,\r\ntrade was very far from being developed. The field of commerce was still\r\nin a great measure clear and unoccupied. The kingdom was, commercially\r\nas well as geographically, detached from the continent. The operations\r\nof trade and the arts were slow, were conducted on a small scale and on\r\nrude systems, and yielded large profits. Exports to foreign parts were\r\ninconsiderable. There were no periodicals to give information as to\r\nanything new in the arts and sciences. Under such circumstances, if new\r\nkinds of business were to be established, it was not unreasonably thought\r\nsafe, or even needful, to allure by promise of exclusive privileges. The\r\nvery reverse are our present circumstances and condition.\r\n\r\nMay I be allowed now to call particular attention to the Act. Anybody may\r\nsee that it authorised exclusive privileges as something exceptional,\r\nsomething almost loathed, as “monopolies.” The House may remember how, in\r\nconformity with this view, Patents used to be construed by the judicial\r\nbench with a leaning against them. It was clearly not contemplated that\r\nthey were, as they are now, to be had at a comparatively easy price,\r\nby a very simple course of procedure organised to hand, at an office\r\nestablished and with machinery ready to be set in motion for the purpose.\r\nA rigid testing examination, or severe, perhaps somewhat adverse,\r\nscrutiny was implied. They were granted for England only, then containing\r\na small population, and requiring not very much for its supply of any\r\nnew article. Moreover, the coveted privilege was a concession of no more\r\nthan leave or right to “work” or “make” (not vend), and that within the\r\nkingdom, which, although it is the only thing the Act allows Patents to\r\nbe granted for, is not required now-a-days. The right was conferrible\r\nonly on the patentee himself; whereas now-a-days, and perhaps from the\r\nfirst, the usage is altogether different; for the patentee is now allowed\r\nto transfer his right, by licence, to others: that is, to vend his\r\n“invention,” taking the noun, not in its sense of a thing made, but of a\r\nmethod, or idea, or right to make or do a thing. Without this licensing,\r\nit is of consequence to remember, the monopoly would be too grossly\r\nand glaringly bad to be defensible or maintainable. There is another\r\ncontrast: by the words of the statute nobody could be patentee but only\r\nthe true and first inventor. Besides, the subject of a Patent clearly was\r\nto be something palpable and visible—something that admitted not of doubt\r\nas to what it was or as to its being novel—something respecting which\r\nthere could be no fear whatever that it would interfere with any already\r\nexisting trade. Above all, a process or operation, especially in a trade\r\nthat already existed, does not appear to be contemplated by the statute.\r\nHow entirely and sadly different is the present practice in this respect.\r\nLet me first quote from Brande’s Dictionary the opening definition that\r\nshows how naturally, and as it seems, unconsciously, writers speak of\r\n“processes,” as the great or only subject-matter:—\r\n\r\n    “The word Patent is commonly used to denote a privilege\r\n    accorded to an inventor for the sole use of some process by\r\n    which an object in demand may be supplied to the public; or\r\n    some product already familiar to the public may be made more\r\n    easily and efficiently.”\r\n\r\nSo the commencement of a Paper on Patents, in the last volume of the\r\nProceedings of the Association for the Promotion of Social Science—in the\r\nfollowing words, “The point asserted in the following paper is, that in a\r\ngrant of Letters Patent, the subject of the grant is a ‘process,’ and not\r\n‘product’”—shows as decisively the complete change that has taken place,\r\nand, let us not forget it, without consent of Parliament, who indeed have\r\nnever been consulted. The alteration of the practice, which is nothing\r\nless than a new law—a law diametrically opposed to the spirit of the\r\nstatute—is the work of the courts of judicature. Better principles might\r\nhave been expected to prevail, for how just is the following reflection,\r\ntaken from the most important “Treatise on the Law of Patents:”—\r\n\r\n    “Every member of the community receives many benefits from the\r\n    society in which he lives, and he is therefore bound, by every\r\n    means in his power, to advance its interests. And it seems\r\n    to be but reasonable that he should be expected to promote\r\n    the public weal by putting the community in possession of any\r\n    discovery he makes which may be for the public good.”\r\n\r\nThe observations I have been making are founded on the words of the\r\nstatute. It is possible, and perhaps I may say probable, that outside\r\nof the statute there was an influence drawing in an opposite direction,\r\nwhich found expression in the Letters Patent. If these were scrutinised,\r\nit is not unlikely even the earliest would be found not to contain\r\nthe strict conditions and limitations which are laid down in the Act.\r\nAn incidental proof of this tendency I notice in one Patent which has\r\nmet my eye, where, though the duration of the Patent in England was\r\nconfined within the permitted period of fourteen years, the duration\r\nin Ireland, which was not subject to the limitation, was in same grant\r\nmade so long as between thirty and forty years. I do not find, in the\r\nexcellent Chronological Index issued by Mr. Woodcraft on behalf of the\r\nPatent-office, anything at all to indicate that desire to favour trade\r\nwas the motive for granting Patents even after the statute was passed.\r\nOn the contrary, a money consideration seems to have been customary.\r\nThe Crown stipulated for yearly payments of various amount, some of\r\nthese being fixed sums, others a tenth, or three-tenths, or a quarter,\r\nor a half, of the clear benefit. In one case 4d. per bushel of salt was\r\nclaimed. In another case 6d. per 100lbs. of bones was stipulated for. In\r\nanother I find 5s. per ton of metal stipulated. All this is suggestive,\r\nbut not less the condition, introduced occasionally, that the articles\r\nmanufactured should be sold at moderate rates. The moderate rates appear\r\nto have been sometimes defined, _e.g._, 100 seals of a new kind were to\r\nbe sold for 1d. Similar and more stringent care was taken when Copyright\r\nfirst became the subject of systematic legislation, to prevent the\r\nmonopoly from making books dear. All such precautions have, in our modern\r\nunwisdom, disappeared. Grotius requires under monopoly a restriction on\r\nprice.\r\n\r\nOne thing, I presume, may be regarded as certain, that neither in the Act\r\nnor in the Letters is there any vestige of the modern political heresy\r\nthat an invention may be legislated for as in any sense property. Even\r\nthe high-sounding phrase, “the rights of inventors,” appears a recent\r\nintroduction.\r\n\r\nIt is not forty years since the greatest number of persons allowed to\r\nparticipate in a Patent was five. This limitation was a lingering remain\r\nof the traditional character of Patents, as monopolies which ought not to\r\nbe provided with facilities for extension but rather be confined within\r\nthe narrowest bounds.\r\n\r\nIt is proper I should now prove from that and other authorities in law,\r\nwhat is the correct interpretation of the word “manufactures” in the\r\nstatute, on whose meaning so much depends. My quotations will exhibit\r\nprogressive development—a thing justly viewed with suspicion, whether its\r\nsphere be the ecclesiastical or the legal. What I now bring under notice,\r\ntaken in connexion with the startling perversion of the words “first and\r\ntrue inventor” and the setting at nought the letter and spirit of the\r\nwords “to make within this realm,” matches the whimsical and ruinous\r\nsophistications we smile at in the “Tale of a Tub.”\r\n\r\nMy first appeal is to Sir E. Coke’s “Institutes:”—\r\n\r\n    “If the substance was in being before, and a new addition\r\n    made thereunto, though that addition made the former more\r\n    profitable, yet it is not a new manufacture in law.”\r\n\r\nThat by a manufacture was meant something so definite as to involve or\r\nimply an art in the sense of a trade, will be seen by another quotation\r\nwhich I make from Serjeant Hawkins, who says—“the King may grant the\r\nsole use of an art invented or first brought into the realm.” So also in\r\n“Bacon’s Abridgment.” The Court of King’s Bench held—\r\n\r\n    “A grant of the sole use of a new invented art is good.... This\r\n    is tied up by the statute to the term of fourteen years; for\r\n    after that time it is presumed to be a known trade.”\r\n\r\nMr. Hindmarch writes—\r\n\r\n    “It was long doubted whether a mode, method, or process of\r\n    itself, and apart from its produce or results, could legally be\r\n    made the subject of a Patent privilege.”\r\n\r\nAfter citing cases, he adds—\r\n\r\n    “These cases show clearly that a process of manufacturing,\r\n    separate and apart, may be made the subject of a Patent\r\n    privilege.”\r\n\r\nMr. Coryton, in his volume on “The Law of Letters Patent,” expresses his\r\nmind thus plainly:—\r\n\r\n    “On the assumption that a Patent confers a monopoly, it\r\n    follows directly that the subject-matter of the Patent must\r\n    be a material thing, capable of sale,[2] and cannot be either\r\n    an improvement, principle, method, process, or system. In\r\n    other words, the subject-matter must be, as it was originally\r\n    defined, a ‘new manufacture.’ A thousand evils have arisen from\r\n    affixing other than the literal interpretation to the terms,”\r\n    &c.\r\n\r\nHe quotes Justice Heath, who said—\r\n\r\n    “That which is the subject of a Patent ought to be vendible;\r\n    otherwise it cannot be a new manufacture.”\r\n\r\nSo Tyndal—\r\n\r\n    “That it is a manufacture can admit of no doubt: it is a\r\n    vendible article, produced by the art and hand of man.”\r\n\r\nMark from the words of Justice Buller, on the same occasion, the\r\nsentiment which was permitted to prevail and neutralise the statute:—\r\n\r\n    “Few men possess greater ingenuity, or have greater merit. If\r\n    their (Boulton and Watt’s) Patent can be sustained in point\r\n    of law, no man ought to envy them the profit and advantages\r\n    arising from it. Even if it cannot be supported, no man ought\r\n    to envy them the profit,” &c.\r\n\r\nWe come to C. J. Eyre:—\r\n\r\n    “According to the letter of the statute, the words ... fall\r\n    very short ... but most certainly the exposition of the\r\n    statute, so far as usage will expound it, has gone very much\r\n    beyond the letter. ‘A deliberate surrender,’ comments Mr.\r\n    Coryton, ‘of judicial power in favour of an accumulation of\r\n    popular errors.’... Later judges, following in the same course,\r\n    have striven rather to regulate the inconsistencies they found,\r\n    than to address themselves to the cause and thus prevent the\r\n    possibility of their recurrence. Writers on this subject have\r\n    on this head followed in the course indicated by the Bench.”\r\n\r\nA practical commentary, and a confirmation of Mr. Coryton’s views, are\r\nfurnished by the fact that the number of Patents granted in the six\r\nreigns preceding that of Geo. III. was only 540 in 85 years, or less than\r\n6½ a-year; whereas now a greater number is granted daily.\r\n\r\nThe actual administration of Patents is exhibited to us by a Return which\r\nthe House has been good enough to order on my motion. That return shows\r\nhow the rate of multiplication has increased, especially in Scotland and\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\nThere have been granted for—\r\n\r\n                                                   In England\r\n                England.   Scotland.   Ireland.  for the Colonies.\r\n    In 1650—None.\r\n    1700            2\r\n    1750            7\r\n    1800           96          13            2              6\r\n    1825          250          62           33             87\r\n    1850          523         227          531            191\r\n    1866        2,121       2,121        2,121           none\r\n    1867        2,292       2,292        2,292           none\r\n\r\nThere were in operation in the United Kingdom at the end of last year no\r\nfewer than 11,369.\r\n\r\nThe House is aware that the Patent-office makes a classification of\r\nPatents. The classification for 1866, the latest year that could be given\r\nin the Return, shows that there are nearly 300 classes, and there were\r\nPatents granted that year affecting those classes to the number of more\r\nthan thirty each on the average. Taking the manufacture and refining of\r\nsugar as a test of other classes, the Return shows that in that trade\r\nthere were granted more than thirty “affecting processes or operations”\r\n(without including hundreds of others of a more general character, to\r\nwhich manufacturers of all sorts are subjected, as, for instance, Patents\r\nfor motive power, heating, &c.). Many noteworthy matters will meet the\r\neye of any person who examines the Return, such as the following: For\r\nmedical, curative, and similar “revelations,” there were granted about\r\n80; for improvements tending to safety, nearly 350; affecting food, about\r\n400; affecting steam-boilers, about 160; steam-engines, about 120.\r\n\r\nBut we have yet to consider the most material points in the Act. To these\r\nI now call attention. The conditions or limitations which the statute\r\nmakes necessary are extremely significant. They are in these words—“Not\r\ncontrary to the law nor mischievous to the State, by raising prices of\r\ncommodities at home or hurt of trade or generally inconvenient.”\r\n\r\nOn these words Sir Edward Coke remarks—\r\n\r\n    “There must be _urgens necessitas_ and _evidens utilitas_.”\r\n\r\nWhat might be understood by being “generally inconvenient” in\r\nthe statute, and how little disposition there was to render that\r\ndisqualification a dead letter, we may gather from the following extract,\r\nwhich shows that saving of labour was in those early days, so far from\r\nbeing a recommendation, an inconvenience. Hear the same authority:—\r\n\r\n    “There was a new invention found out that bonnets and caps\r\n    might be thickened in a fulling mill, by which means more might\r\n    be done than by the labours of fourscore men who got their\r\n    living by it. It was ordained by an Act, 7 Edward VI. c. 8,\r\n    that bonnets and caps should be thickened and fulled by the\r\n    strength of men, and not by a fulling mill, for it was holden\r\n    inconvenient to turn so many labouring men to idleness.”\r\n\r\nOn which passage Mr. Farey (a gentleman eminent on Patent questions), who\r\nquotes it in an elaborate review of Patent-Law at the end of the Blue\r\nBook of 1829, the Report of the Committee on Patents for Inventions,\r\nmakes the following remarks: “If this decision had been followed, it\r\nwould have set aside every Patent for invention.” True, and the more’s\r\nthe pity, perhaps! Let us hail the admission.\r\n\r\nSir Edward explains, and I read, the whole passage that I have cited,\r\nnot as a lawyer might who wished to ascertain whether by oversight in\r\ndrawing the Act or by the malleability and elasticity of language it\r\ncould be interpreted even non-naturally to suit a purpose, but as honest,\r\nblunt Englishmen would understand it, as the English gentlemen who passed\r\nthe Act must have understood it and meant the Crown to understand it.\r\nI submit, Mr. Speaker, that at this moment, and by this statute, and\r\naccording to the common law which this statute declares, Patents are\r\nillegal which raise prices or hurt trade. The framing of the sentence\r\nleaves no doubt whatever that the antecedent to the words “they be not\r\ncontrary to the law nor mischievous to the State, by raising prices of\r\ncommodities at home or hurt of trade,” are these words, “Letters Patent\r\nand grants of privilege.” The preceding section contains the same words.\r\nThat section was introduced in order to shorten the duration of Patents\r\ngranted previously, and to nullify any that raised prices or hurt trade.\r\nIt is plain that the intention of Parliament and of the Sovereign was to\r\nallow no monopoly to exist whose effect would be either to interfere with\r\nthe extent or efficiency of industrial occupations, or to make prices,\r\neven of the new manufacture or commodity, dearer under the restriction\r\nthan they would be without it. Even so late as the last century, the\r\nconsistency of monopoly with cheapening of prices was believed in. As\r\nan example, I have been told that when the Paraphrases of the Church of\r\nScotland were issued, the monopoly was given to a particular printer,\r\nwith this purpose expressly stated.\r\n\r\nWhat language can be plainer than that of the statute? As that statute\r\nis still the charter of our commercial freedom and the chart by which we\r\nmay discover the track we must follow in order to our return to the open\r\nand safe, and as its sound limitations are still the law of the land, I\r\nam entitled at the outset to contend that they ought to be put in force.\r\nThey have been utterly neglected, and the nation suffers much from the\r\nneglect. As to this, hear my witnesses. I produce them chiefly from the\r\nfollowing Blue-books: That issued by the Committee of this House which\r\nsat in 1829, that issued by the Committee of the House of Lords which sat\r\nin 1851, and that issued by the Royal Commission in 1865. Here remark\r\nthe strange failures of expectations that characterise the proceedings\r\nof Parliament in regard to Patent-Law. The Committee of 1829 recommended\r\nthat they should be allowed to continue their investigations next\r\nSession, but they appear not to have been allowed. After the inquiries\r\nof 1851 there was, as a Petition which I have perused, presented to this\r\nHouse, shows, an understanding that the whole subject would be inquired\r\ninto; but this never has been done down to this day. A Commission was\r\nindeed appointed in 1862, but they were confined to the question of the\r\n“working” of the laws. Indications were given, both before and after it,\r\nthat the question of the policy of these laws should be examined into.\r\nThe Liverpool Chamber of Commerce repeatedly urged this; _e.g._, in\r\nMarch, 1862, when that body petitioned the House thus: “They therefore\r\npray that your honourable House will appoint a Select Committee to\r\ninquire into the policy and operation of those laws.” But the matter\r\nis still in abeyance, and, notwithstanding promises in a Royal Speech,\r\nlegislative action is suspended.\r\n\r\nTo proceed: Mr. Lennard in this House, in April, 1829, declared his\r\nopinion—“It was not desirable to facilitate overmuch the obtaining of\r\nPatents by any reduction of expense.”\r\n\r\nSo Sir Robert Peel, in the interest of the manufacturers of Lancashire,\r\nCheshire, and Yorkshire, deprecated cheapening of Patents and their\r\nconsequent multiplication. At that period another member objected even to\r\nthe publishing of specifications, because\r\n\r\n    “It enabled persons to carry the invention abroad, where, of\r\n    course, the Patent article was made, the foreign market shut\r\n    against the real invention, and the undue benefit granted\r\n    foreigners of having the free use of the invention fourteen\r\n    years before the patentee’s countrymen.”\r\n\r\nThe House will observe that the complaint here is not that we were hurt\r\nin British markets—for these the protective system of duties closed—but\r\nthat we lost our hold of foreign markets.\r\n\r\nSir Mark Isambard Brunel, the eminent engineer, told the Committee of\r\n1829:—\r\n\r\n    “I have had several Patents myself; I think that Patents are\r\n    like lottery offices, where people run with great expectations,\r\n    and enter anything almost.\r\n\r\n    “And if they were very cheap, there would be still more\r\n    obstacles in the way of good ones. I think the expense of\r\n    Patents should be pretty high in this country, or else, if it\r\n    is low, you will have hundreds of Patents more yearly, and you\r\n    would obstruct very much the valuable pursuits.”\r\n\r\nThat Patents are, indeed, a lottery in respect to the uncertainty whether\r\nthe patentees draw a prize or a blank, I refer to the words of Mr. Curtis\r\nbefore the Royal Commission:—\r\n\r\n    “We have taken out a number of Patents, and frequently those\r\n    to which we have attached the least importance have become\r\n    the most valuable, and, on the contrary, those from which we\r\n    have expected large things we have reaped comparatively no\r\n    advantage.”\r\n\r\nMr. Coryton says in a note:—\r\n\r\n    “The opinions of the witnesses examined before the Committee\r\n    of the House of Commons in 1829 were almost unanimous to the\r\n    effect that Patents should not be too cheap, lest the country\r\n    should be inundated with them.”\r\n\r\nAmong my private papers, I find in 1851 the Manchester Chamber of\r\nCommerce expressing the same fear in a letter to Mr. F. Hill, a portion\r\nof which I now present:—\r\n\r\n    “It is considered by this Board to be a primary axiom that\r\n    every Patent granted is, during its exclusiveness, a limitation\r\n    to a certain extent of the general rights of the people, and\r\n    that in those Patents which have reference to manufacturing\r\n    processes there may be a disturbance of the general industry\r\n    of the people. This Board would, therefore, deprecate a too\r\n    great facility in the obtaining of Patents. If the cost be\r\n    made cheap, every trifling improvement in every process of\r\n    manufacture would be secured by a Patent. In a few years no\r\n    man would be able to make such improvement in his machinery,\r\n    or processes, as his own experience may suggest, without\r\n    infringing upon some other person’s Patent. Endless litigation\r\n    would follow, and the spirit of invention in small matters\r\n    would be rather checked than encouraged.”\r\n\r\nThe realisation of these fears, as well as the inconsistency of our\r\npractice with the conditions which our forefathers, more wise than the\r\npresent generation, imposed, will be seen from the specimen extracts\r\nwhich I will now read, begging that it be remembered a very large\r\nreduction in the cost of Patents was made in 1852. The House will pardon\r\nme if it finds these extracts are not arranged with any rigid regard to\r\norder, but form a too _rudis indigestaque moles_.\r\n\r\nThe following prove that there is a natural tendency to excessive\r\nmultiplication of Patents, and to the making of the same inventions, and\r\nof inventions directed to the same end, or moving on the same line, by a\r\nnumber of persons at or about one and the same time.\r\n\r\nThis very week you read in the papers a judgment given by the Lord\r\nChancellor, which contains the declaration that a person in specifying an\r\ninvention may be held as preventing “the loss for a year or more to the\r\npublic of the fruits of the ingenuity of many minds which commonly are\r\nworking together in regard to the same invention.”\r\n\r\nThe _Journal of Jurisprudence_ says well:—\r\n\r\n    “The rights of the inventor are also liable to interference\r\n    of another kind. A rival manufacturer invents independently\r\n    the same machine, or one involving the same principle. He is\r\n    then, by natural law, at liberty to publish his invention\r\n    without regard to the rights of the first inventor, seeing\r\n    that he did not acquire his knowledge of its powers from the\r\n    latter, and experience proves that, in point of fact, the same\r\n    processes are frequently discovered by different individuals\r\n    independently of each other. In an age of mechanical invention,\r\n    an inventor cannot deprive the world of a new process by\r\n    keeping it a secret. He can at most only retard the progress of\r\n    discovery by a few years.... We submit that the fundamental\r\n    principle of any legislative contract between inventors and the\r\n    public should be, that the right of using the invention should\r\n    be open to all Her Majesty’s subjects. Exclusive privileges,\r\n    conferred for the purpose of enabling patentees to divide their\r\n    profits with a few favoured manufacturing establishments, are\r\n    indefensible upon any recognised principles of economy. Patents\r\n    are in fact, as they are in law considered to be, trading\r\n    monopolies; and the interests of the public imperatively\r\n    require that, as monopolies, they should be swept away.”\r\n\r\nMr. Webster, Q.C., a high authority, says:—\r\n\r\n    “I mean the discovery, for instance, of some chemical property,\r\n    or the application of some property, of matter of recent\r\n    discovery, or a certain effect, for instance, in dyeing; that\r\n    becoming known as a chemical law, then persons rush to obtain\r\n    Patents for different applications and different modifications\r\n    of it.”\r\n\r\nSee by my next quotations how great is the obstruction the multiplication\r\nof Patents creates, or, in the words of the Act, the “general\r\ninconvenience” they occasion.\r\n\r\nMr. James Meadows Rendel, Civil Engineer, in 1851:—\r\n\r\n    “During the twenty-five years that I have been in practice, I\r\n    have frequently felt the inconvenience of the present state of\r\n    the Patent-Law, particularly with reference to the excessive\r\n    number of Patents taken out for frivolous and unimportant\r\n    inventions, which I think are much more embarrassing than the\r\n    Patents that apply to really important inventions.\r\n\r\n    “I have found them interfere in a way that very much\r\n    embarrasses an engineer in carrying out large works, without\r\n    being of the slightest advantage to the inventors, excepting\r\n    that in some cases a man who takes out a Patent finds a\r\n    capitalist (however frivolous the invention) who will buy the\r\n    Patent, as a sort of patent-monger, who holds it, not for any\r\n    useful purpose, but as a means of making claims which embarrass\r\n    persons who are not prepared to dispute questions of that sort.\r\n    I think that in that way many Patents are granted which are\r\n    but of little benefit to the real inventor, serving only to\r\n    fill the coffers of parties who only keep them to inconvenience\r\n    those who might have occasion to use the particular invention\r\n    in some adjunct way which was never contemplated by the\r\n    inventor.\r\n\r\n    “After you have designed something that is really useful in\r\n    engineering works, you are told that some part of that design\r\n    interferes with some Patent granted for an entirely different\r\n    purpose, and which might in itself be frivolous, but important\r\n    in the new combination; and one has such a horror of the\r\n    Patent-Laws, that one evades it by designing something else,\r\n    perhaps as good in itself, but giving one infinite trouble,\r\n    without any advantage to the holder of the Patent. I have\r\n    frequently found this to be the case.”\r\n\r\nMr. W. S. Hale, candle manufacturer, said in 1851, in answer to the\r\nquestion—\r\n\r\n    “At present they are obstructions to you?—Decidedly.\r\n\r\n    “You say that, practically, you have found the existence of\r\n    Patents in themselves useless—a great obstruction to the\r\n    introduction of inventions which would otherwise have been of\r\n    value?—Certainly.\r\n\r\n    “The great objection which I conceive many parties have to\r\n    introduce real improvements arises from useless Patents. I am\r\n    in treaty now for one or two which in themselves are useless,\r\n    yet they contain the germ of something, and it is worth my\r\n    while, if I can get them for a small sum, to purchase them; but\r\n    directly you make application for a Patent of that description,\r\n    it becomes very valuable all at once; the party conceives you\r\n    are desirous of possessing yourself of it, and that you will be\r\n    inclined to give anything for the use of it.”\r\n\r\nIn like manner Sir William Armstrong answered this question, put in 1864—\r\n\r\n    “Is it within your knowledge that considerable inconvenience\r\n    does exist in those branches of business with which you\r\n    are most conversant from the multiplicity of Patents?—Most\r\n    certainly, and great obstruction.”\r\n\r\nSo also Mr. James Spence, of Liverpool, a well-known correspondent of the\r\n_Times_ during the American war, said—\r\n\r\n    “It is difficult for a manufacturer to move in any direction\r\n    without treading on the toes of some sort of a patentee.”\r\n\r\nLikewise Mr. Montague E. Smith, Q.C., M.P., said:—\r\n\r\n    “In several cases in which I have myself been counsel, very\r\n    great inconvenience has arisen from the multiplicity of Patents\r\n    which an inventor has had to wade through to see that he has\r\n    not been anticipated.”\r\n\r\nHow truly did Sir W. Armstrong observe to the Commission—\r\n\r\n    “You cannot grant a monopoly without excluding other persons\r\n    who are working upon the same subject.”\r\n\r\nAgain:—\r\n\r\n    “Here the State grants to an individual a monopoly, and\r\n    therefore the public are at his mercy.”\r\n\r\nMr. J. S. Russell, who himself has taken out a good many Patents, speaks\r\nmore specifically:—\r\n\r\n    “There are a great many Patents of that kind taken out for\r\n    boilers of steam-engines, and boilers of steam-engines admit\r\n    of a very enormous variety of shape and proportion without\r\n    damaging their efficiency.... The consequence is, that I have\r\n    not defended any of my own. I have never made of mine more\r\n    than a mere registry of priority of invention. I have not made\r\n    mine a source of money, but I have suffered in this way from\r\n    Patents: I have gone on, in the course of my business, doing my\r\n    ordinary work, and I have found other people taking out Patents\r\n    for what I was doing without calling it an invention, and then\r\n    prosecuting me under the Patent they had taken out for my own\r\n    inventions, and it appears that there is nothing to prohibit\r\n    them from doing that.”\r\n\r\nThis I can from experience endorse. He is then asked—\r\n\r\n    “If you were able to prove that you had been carrying on an\r\n    invention, whatever it might be, at the time when the person\r\n    claiming to hold a Patent for it took out his Patent, would not\r\n    that relieve you from all difficulty in the matter?—It would\r\n    only give me the pleasure of defending a law-suit.”\r\n\r\nMr. Curtis, engineer, Manchester, said:—\r\n\r\n    “Many parties in trade have made alterations without being\r\n    aware of their being patented, and when they have used them for\r\n    a length of time, they have found that the patentee has come\r\n    upon them and made a claim for Patent-right.”\r\n\r\nMr. Platt, of Oldham, whom you are happy to see as a member, said:—\r\n\r\n    “I think that there is scarcely a week, certainly not a\r\n    month, that passes but what we have a notice of some kind\r\n    or other of things that we have never heard of in any way,\r\n    and do not know of in the least, that we are infringing upon\r\n    them, and the difficulty is to get at any knowledge. We may\r\n    be now infringing, and may have been infringing for years,\r\n    and a person may have been watching us all the time, and when\r\n    he thinks that we have made a sufficient number he may come\r\n    down upon us, and there is no record. A very large number of\r\n    Patents are now taken out for what is termed a combination of\r\n    known things, and known things for the same purpose, and the\r\n    descriptions of those Patents are generally so bad that it is\r\n    impossible to tell the parts that are actually patented; in\r\n    matters of that kind it has become a very serious question as\r\n    to conducting a large business.”\r\n\r\nIn 1851, Sir William Cubitt spoke of an inventor of filters:—\r\n\r\n    “After he began to supply his customers, he received notice\r\n    from a house in Liverpool that he would be prosecuted; he\r\n    received intimation of legal proceedings against him for\r\n    interfering with his, the Liverpool man’s, Patent. I have some\r\n    of those filters. The manufacturer of these things, who had no\r\n    Patent, came to me to consult me upon the subject. I at once\r\n    saw how the case stood, having regard to the specification of\r\n    the Liverpool patentee, that he (the latter) had taken out a\r\n    Patent for that which another man had before done, so exactly\r\n    that the words of the specification and the drawings fitted the\r\n    first man’s invention, which was without a Patent, therefore\r\n    his Patent would have been null and void. I advised my friend\r\n    to write to the patentee to inform him of the fact that he had\r\n    taken up a case which he could not support, and that he himself\r\n    was infringing upon the invention of the first man, who had no\r\n    Patent; that brought the Liverpool man to me, I having been\r\n    referred to as having one of these filters in use. I explained\r\n    to him that I had had the patent filter of the other man for\r\n    two or three years. Then what was to be done? I advised my\r\n    friend, who was in fact one of the Ransomes, of Ipswich,\r\n    to tell the Liverpool patentee if he did not come to some\r\n    arrangement of a business-like nature, he himself would have to\r\n    become the prosecutor, and to sue out the ‘_scire facias_’ to\r\n    make him prove his Patent-right, which is an expensive legal\r\n    proceeding, and very troublesome to a patentee. I believe they\r\n    have since made some business arrangement; but that shows how\r\n    Patents may be, and are frequently, taken out for things which\r\n    have been previously invented.”\r\n\r\nAs to the bad effects of Patents, I quote again from Mr. Scott Russell:—\r\n\r\n    “The unlimited power given by a monopoly to an inventor has\r\n    this practical effect at present, that when an invention has\r\n    been made the subject of a Patent, everybody shrinks from\r\n    it, everybody runs away from it, everybody avoids it as an\r\n    unlimited evil, because the person who has the monopoly can\r\n    subject you to a most expensive prosecution, and can charge you\r\n    a most inconvenient sum for what you have done, and can punish\r\n    you in every way for having touched his invention.”\r\n\r\nMr. Grove says it is natural that people should yield to the holder of\r\nthe Patent, for, if\r\n\r\n    “He has a letter from a patentee saying, ‘You are infringing my\r\n    Patent;’ I do not believe that the tradesman would go to the\r\n    expense of litigation with the patentee, and for this reason,\r\n    it is the patentee’s interest to give a very large sum of money\r\n    to support his Patent. His Patent, although for a very trivial\r\n    thing, may, taking the vast extent of sale, be a very lucrative\r\n    affair, and therefore it is worth his while to lay out a large\r\n    sum of money to support his Patent. It is not worth the while\r\n    of the opponent, because he has only a little stock which\r\n    affects him; the patentee has his whole interest consolidated\r\n    in the Patent. All those who might oppose the Patent are a\r\n    scattered body, namely, the public generally, not one of whom\r\n    has any strong interest in opposing the Patent; and I believe\r\n    that that has been very much worked by patentees, particularly\r\n    in a small and comparatively frivolous and perhaps an all but\r\n    useless invention. The public is a scattered body, not one\r\n    of whom has sufficient interest to meet with equal force the\r\n    patentee.”\r\n\r\nMr. Platt, M.P., presents the following case, to show how unprincipled\r\npeople use the power which the law gives them, and how, even with a\r\ngood case, if they but knew it to be so, people in business are led to\r\nsuccumb to extortion:—\r\n\r\n    “The fourteen years of the Patent had expired, and five years,\r\n    so that it was nineteen years from the date of the Patent\r\n    before the action that I now speak of was commenced. It was\r\n    commenced by the parties, and I may say that the person who\r\n    was the original patentee was a person of no money whatever;\r\n    but he persuaded some party, I believe some lawyer, to advance\r\n    some money in order to take up this case. I know that many\r\n    machine-makers, rather than contest the case, absolutely paid\r\n    the money—the different sums of money that were demanded of\r\n    them. I came up this afternoon with a gentleman in a train\r\n    from Manchester, who mentioned this case to me, and who stated\r\n    that one of his own clients offered as large a sum as £2,000\r\n    in one case, to settle the matter. I found that the system was\r\n    to attack the smaller men, and by that means to extract money\r\n    in different ways, and there have been a number of instances\r\n    in which parties have paid in that way. Although not attacked\r\n    in this instance myself, a neighbour of mine was; I looked\r\n    over his evidence, and I told him that I thought I could amend\r\n    it very much, and I told him further that I would be a party\r\n    to the expense. I said, let me take the case in hand, which I\r\n    did. Now, nineteen years is a very long time for a machine,\r\n    and this machine was of a very valuable kind; hundreds upon\r\n    thousands had been made during the nineteen years, and if this\r\n    person could have established his claim to a Patent-right,\r\n    he would have made a very large sum of money, so large as to\r\n    be almost incalculable. It so happened that I recollected,\r\n    when it was brought to my memory, that we had made a number\r\n    of those machines long before the date of that Patent, and\r\n    the difficulty then was to prove that such a machine had been\r\n    made, for in nineteen years, speaking of cotton machinery, such\r\n    machines would probably all have been broken up, scarcely any\r\n    were to be found in the country; but it so happened that in one\r\n    instance a very large firm of manufacturers in Preston, of the\r\n    name of Horrocks, Miller, and Co., had two or three of these\r\n    machines still left. I got Mr. Miller to come up to London, and\r\n    we brought one of these machines with us. It was taken into\r\n    court, and in a moment their own witness admitted that this was\r\n    precisely the same thing that the other parties had been paying\r\n    royalty to this man for, and the case was at once abandoned by\r\n    Mr. Webster, who was then conducting it.”\r\n\r\nSir W. Armstrong told the Commission:—\r\n\r\n    “Another great evil of the Patent system is this, that an\r\n    invalid Patent really answers the purpose of protection almost\r\n    as well as a valid one. I believe that there is not one Patent\r\n    in ten which would bear scrutiny, and the mere name of a Patent\r\n    often answers all the purpose. Nobody will face the litigation\r\n    necessary to get rid of it.\r\n\r\n    “In very many cases people prefer to pay black mail rather than\r\n    undergo the expense of a law-suit?—In almost all cases; I know\r\n    that in my own experience, if I find that a man has a Patent\r\n    which I am satisfied is not a valid one, I would rather go out\r\n    of the way to avoid any conflict with him.”\r\n\r\nSo also Mr. Curtis:—\r\n\r\n    “I have in one or two cases given £200 to a party for the use\r\n    of an invention in which I have told him at once that what we\r\n    used was not an infringement in any shape or form; but rather\r\n    than run the chance of going to a tribunal where I was fighting\r\n    with a man of straw, I have consented (thinking it was prudent\r\n    to do so) to pay £200.”\r\n\r\nMr. Woodcroft, in keeping with all this, testified—\r\n\r\n    “I know of existing Patents which are but old inventions, as\r\n    old as the hills.”\r\n\r\nThe following extract from the Transactions of the National Association\r\nfor the Promotion of Social Science presents another illustration of the\r\nmischief the Patent system works:—\r\n\r\n    “The Patent in question having been purchased for a trifle by\r\n    Mr. Foxwell, its merits were subjected to close scrutiny, and\r\n    the specification being found to be defective in some respects,\r\n    but possessing the quality of elasticity from the vagueness\r\n    of its phraseology, it was resolved to improve it under the\r\n    Disclaimer and Amendment Act. After undergoing a compound\r\n    operation analogous to pruning and grafting, it was found to\r\n    embrace almost every kind of shuttle sewing machine. In other\r\n    words, it was hoped by the possession of this invaluable Patent\r\n    to control nine-tenths of the sewing machine trade of Great\r\n    Britain. Fired with this idea, Mr. Foxwell commenced legal\r\n    proceedings against a well-known sewing machine manufacturer\r\n    for compensation for an alleged infringement of his amended\r\n    Patent, and at the third trial succeeded in driving his\r\n    opponent into a compromise, whereby the sum of £4,250 was paid\r\n    in liquidation of all demands. Encouraged by this success, he,\r\n    through his solicitor, apprised the trade of his intention to\r\n    levy royalties on the users of all needle and shuttle machines\r\n    other than those manufactured by his licences, and, failing to\r\n    bring many to his terms, he filed bills in Chancery against 134\r\n    defaulters.”\r\n\r\nMr. Abel, of Chancery-lane, in a recent pamphlet, writes thus, to show\r\nhow, in self-defence, Patents require to be taken:—\r\n\r\n    “In many cases an inventor takes out Patents for immaterial\r\n    improvements that he is continually making in his processes or\r\n    machinery, merely for the purpose of indisputably publishing\r\n    those improvements, in order thereby to prevent the chance of\r\n    his being debarred from the use of the same, through a Patent\r\n    being obtained for them by somebody else.”\r\n\r\nThe following statement is authenticated by Mr. Grove:—\r\n\r\n    “I had at one time great doubts about it, but things have\r\n    arrived at a dead lock. The Courts now really cannot try these\r\n    cases. We have at these very sittings three Patent cases made\r\n    remanets because they cannot be tried; they interfere too much\r\n    with other business. We have at this moment going on a Patent\r\n    trial which is now in its fourth day. We have had within, I\r\n    think, a week another trial of a Patent, which lasted seven,\r\n    and a third which lasted five days. During the time that these\r\n    Patent cases have been going on there have been heavy Patent\r\n    arbitrations going on, two of which I can speak to myself; one,\r\n    I think, lasted seventeen days, and the other, which involved a\r\n    very simple issue, lasted six or seven days. Those arbitrations\r\n    went on contemporaneously, and the cases were obliged to be\r\n    tried by arbitration because the Courts could not try them; it\r\n    would have occupied too much public time. While these cases\r\n    have been going on several Patent cases have been also ready\r\n    for argument in banco, and one has been postponed.”\r\n\r\nOn this part of the subject I again cite Mr. Platt:—\r\n\r\n    “There being an adjournment, for example, for a fortnight or\r\n    three weeks, is there constantly a fresh burst of evidence to\r\n    meet the difficulty raised at the last meeting?—Yes, it is so;\r\n    and that prolongs the case very much; in fact, the case that\r\n    I have in my mind now I have no doubt will cost the parties a\r\n    sum of £4,000 or £5,000. I cannot see how it is possible for\r\n    the verdict to be against them, for it has been a frivolous and\r\n    vexatious proceeding from the beginning, and with the idea of\r\n    extorting money.”\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Scott Russell:—\r\n\r\n    “In your experience have you not seen a great number of\r\n    dishonest litigants, plaintiffs who bring actions in the way of\r\n    persecution, and defendants who desire to destroy a Patent, and\r\n    where one or other of the parties for the most part acts in bad\r\n    faith, trying to injure his adversary in any way that he can?—I\r\n    should say that the greater number of Patent cases are cases of\r\n    oppression.\r\n\r\n    “Have you known cases of oppression where the patentee has been\r\n    the oppressor?—Yes, frequently.\r\n\r\n    “Have you known cases of patentees with a good Patent, and in\r\n    which there has been what may be called a dishonest attempt to\r\n    destroy it?—Yes, I have known both on a very large scale; for\r\n    example, there was the great hot blast case. I was engaged in\r\n    that from the beginning in the capacity of arbitrator; and in\r\n    that great hot blast case the whole litigation arose from the\r\n    ironmasters, who were making enormous sums of money, wishing\r\n    to get rid of a very small Patent rate per ton, which had\r\n    accumulated to an enormous sum in consequence of the success of\r\n    the Patent. The expenses in the hot blast Patent case amounted,\r\n    I should think, to more than £100,000.”\r\n\r\nIn the celebrated capsule case, the expenses have been somewhere about\r\nhalf of that enormous sum. In another case, about three-quarters of it.\r\nHow true, then, is the following, from _Chambers’ Cyclopædia_:—\r\n\r\n    “When a Patent has been granted, if it is of such a nature\r\n    as to lead to competition, infringements are almost matter\r\n    of course; and the only mode of discovering and checking the\r\n    infringement is so ineffective that inventors generally pass\r\n    their lives in constant litigation, fighting a succession\r\n    of imitators, who often have nothing to lose by defeat, and\r\n    therefore entail all the greater burden on the legitimate\r\n    manufacturer. It has been said that not more than three per\r\n    cent. are remunerative. A Royal Commission has lately been\r\n    engaged in inquiries as to the best mode of remunerating\r\n    inventors and improving the law with reference to\r\n    infringement; but it is doubtful how far the subject is capable\r\n    of being put on a better footing, so many difficulties being\r\n    inherent in it.”\r\n\r\nAnd how many of these pernicious Patents do honourable members think have\r\nbeen repealed? Allow me, as to this, to quote Mr. Grove—\r\n\r\n    “... Very few Patents have been repealed, and, generally\r\n    speaking, the patentee has been victorious.”\r\n\r\nAnd the Commissioners’ Report:—\r\n\r\n    “Number of Patents repealed by _scire facias_ from 1617 to October,\r\n      1852                                                             19\r\n\r\n    “Number of Patents repealed by _scire facias_ from October, 1852,\r\n     to December, 1861                                               None.”\r\n\r\nA natural question suggests itself, Who is to get a Patent, since in many\r\ncases there is a plurality of almost simultaneous inventors? Listen to\r\nthe words of Mr. Webster, Q.C., author of well-known books on Patent-Law:—\r\n\r\n    “I have frequently had brought before me five or six Patents\r\n    for the same thing within two or three years, or perhaps even\r\n    within a year. I remember a remarkable case of a Patent for\r\n    an improvement in railway wheels, where there were as many, I\r\n    think, as six Patents almost within six months.”\r\n\r\nSir W. Armstrong shows that sometimes the chief benefit of inventions\r\ngoes to the wrong parties:—\r\n\r\n    “A person obtaining a Patent for a crude invention prevents\r\n    other persons from entering upon the same ground unless at\r\n    their own peril, and I have known cases where, in the ignorance\r\n    of the existence of a Patent, improvements have been made, and\r\n    practical value given to an invention which has been previously\r\n    patented, and then that patentee has come forward and said,\r\n    ‘That is my invention, and you must pay me for using it.’ Other\r\n    people have given additional value to his Patent, that is to\r\n    say, they have made improvements which he can appropriate to\r\n    his Patent, and in that way it gives it an additional value.\r\n    The mere conception of primary ideas in inventions is not a\r\n    matter involving much labour, and it is not a thing, as a rule,\r\n    I think, demanding a large reward; it is rather the subsequent\r\n    labour which the man bestows in perfecting the invention—a\r\n    thing which the Patent-Laws at present scarcely recognise.\r\n\r\n    “But you are unable to do so, because you cannot interfere with\r\n    the Patent over it. Do you find practically that that clogs the\r\n    progress of invention?—I will take one of my own inventions. I\r\n    will take an hydraulic crane, for example, which I will suppose\r\n    that I do not patent, and I will suppose that another person\r\n    invents an improved valve and applies it to hydraulic cranes,\r\n    and that he patents that improvement upon hydraulic cranes;\r\n    clearly the result of that is, that if it gives an improved\r\n    character to the whole machine he will obtain the monopoly of\r\n    the machine, because he has a Patent for the improvement, and\r\n    that carries with it the machine itself.”\r\n\r\nMr. Webster shows how it is that men of science, the real discoverers,\r\nmiss reward:—\r\n\r\n    “The number of inventions brought out by purely scientific\r\n    people I believe to be very few, and for this reason: purely\r\n    scientific people want practical knowledge to enable them to\r\n    carry out their own ideas; the mass of inventions, I have no\r\n    doubt, are made by workmen, or persons of skill and science\r\n    engaged in some actual manufacture.”\r\n\r\nMr. I. K. Brunel tells—\r\n\r\n    “Cooke and Wheatstone derived, I believe, a large sum of money\r\n    from the electric telegraph; and I believe you will find fifty\r\n    people who will say that they invented it also. I suppose it\r\n    would be difficult to trace the original inventor of anything.”\r\n\r\nSir W. Armstrong speaks regarding that frequent case—\r\n\r\n    “An idea which is present to the minds of very many persons\r\n    at the same time. Without any reference to his competency\r\n    to develop that idea, and to give it practical value, he is\r\n    allowed to have a monopoly of it, and thereby to exclude all\r\n    other persons.”\r\n\r\nHe points out that—\r\n\r\n    “As soon as a demand arises for any machine, or implement,\r\n    or process, the means of satisfying that demand present\r\n    themselves to very many persons at the same time, and it is\r\n    very unfair, and very impolitic I think, that the person who\r\n    gets first in the race to the Patent-office should have the\r\n    means of preventing all others from competing with him in the\r\n    development of that particular means of process.”\r\n\r\nMr. Grove, Q.C., eminent in science as in law, hints at a remedy:—\r\n\r\n    “I am speaking of classes of inventions which, if they may be\r\n    called inventions at all, would inevitably follow the usual\r\n    course of trade and the fair scope which every man should have\r\n    for modifying or improving his commodity. I would not shut out\r\n    the public from those things. I would exclude from Letters\r\n    Patent those changes which would naturally follow in the\r\n    ordinary uses of the machines. I would not prohibit a tradesman\r\n    from exercising the same ordinary skill in using his machine\r\n    as we should all be expected to exercise in anything which we\r\n    happened to make or from changing its form.”\r\n\r\nAnother question as naturally thrusts itself forward, How far have we\r\nbenefited by having more Patents? Although the Act of 1852 has greatly\r\nmultiplied the number, Mr. Woodcroft, the intelligent head of the\r\nPatent-office, gives the following answer:—\r\n\r\n    “There has been no considerable increase of bonâ fide Patents\r\n    compared with the old law?—No.”\r\n\r\nVery suggestive are the following observations of Mr. Grove, as showing\r\nwhich are the kinds of invention, so-called, that pay best, and how\r\nabsurd, if people would reflect, they must consider our present mode of\r\nrewarding and stimulating invention:—\r\n\r\n    “A Patent may be an extremely valuable invention; for instance,\r\n    the manufacture of aluminium is of the utmost importance,\r\n    but it was of very little trade value for a long time.\r\n    When aluminium was first made what I may call a practical\r\n    manufacture, it was of no value to any tradesman at all; it\r\n    would take probably ten or twenty years before such a thing\r\n    could have any approach to practical value. On the other\r\n    hand, the most frivolous Patent—the turn of a lady’s hat, the\r\n    cutting of a shirt-frill, or a new boot-heel—may be of very\r\n    considerable value, from the number of bootmakers all over the\r\n    country who would have to order it, every one of whom would pay\r\n    an extremely trifling licence duty, and therefore the Patent\r\n    would be a very good Patent to the patentee. In my judgment\r\n    those are not good subjects for Patents, and there the opponent\r\n    would have no interest equivalent to that of the patentee to\r\n    meet him.\r\n\r\n    “Although I know that the Law Courts have come step by step to\r\n    include a greater number of inventions, yet I should not call\r\n    an improvement in a shirt-frill, that is to say, a peculiar\r\n    method of cutting the little puckered linen which is sewn and\r\n    used for shirt-frills, or a particular shape of the brim of\r\n    a lady’s hat (I am speaking of existing Patents), a proper\r\n    subject for a Patent.”\r\n\r\nThe following is from the evidence of Sir Francis Crossley, Bart., M.P.:—\r\n\r\n    “A Patent was taken out for simply putting india-rubber at the\r\n    end of a glove, so as to make it tight round the wrist; that\r\n    might have been considered a frivolous Patent, but I believe\r\n    that it was thought to be a very good one in the trade, and it\r\n    was new and useful.”\r\n\r\nSo Mr. Richard Roberts, of Manchester—\r\n\r\n    “In the case of an improved button, the Patent pays very well.”\r\n\r\nOf another class of illegitimate Patents, Mr. Newton, the eminent Patent\r\nAgent, says:—\r\n\r\n    “Patents for obvious applications.—I may take for instance the\r\n    use of alpaca for covering umbrellas. There is no invention in\r\n    it.”\r\n\r\nIn 1851 Mr. Carpmael was as distinct and condemnatory:—\r\n\r\n    “A multitude of things for which Patents are granted have no\r\n    invention in them; in nineteen cases out of twenty, if there\r\n    were cheap Patents, they would be for things which already\r\n    exist, and people would only use Patents for the purpose of\r\n    advertisement and publication.\r\n\r\n    “If you grant a Patent, and give to a man the means of\r\n    advertisement, for a small sum of money, he will not\r\n    investigate it in the slightest degree in the world; he does\r\n    not inquire, and does not wish to inquire, but he goes and\r\n    spends his money, and then he advertises, because the Patent\r\n    appears to give him a standing different from his competitors\r\n    in the same way of business.”\r\n\r\nIn 1829 Mr. Farey, Patent Agent, went further:—\r\n\r\n    “I have urged the utter worthlessness of their Patents, but\r\n    they did complete the specification; they have sometimes\r\n    acknowledged, and said perhaps they might nevertheless sell the\r\n    Patent to some one who did not know that fact.”\r\n\r\nMark now how Patents hinder progress in manufacture. Hear Mr. Brunel:—\r\n\r\n    “Take the Electric Telegraph Company. I believe we should\r\n    have had that telegraph much improved, and that it would be\r\n    working much cheaper, and that we should have had it all over\r\n    the country, but for the misfortune they laboured under, of\r\n    having Patents which they were obliged to protect; and they\r\n    were obliged to buy up everybody’s inventions, good or bad,\r\n    that interfered technically with theirs. I firmly believe that\r\n    they have been obliged to refrain from adopting many good\r\n    improvements which they might have introduced themselves, but\r\n    did not, because they were afraid that it might shake their\r\n    Patent; and I believe that the stoppage put to inventions by\r\n    this state of things is far greater than would result from\r\n    secrecy.”\r\n\r\nThe same is certified by Sir W. Armstrong:—\r\n\r\n    “I am quite satisfied that a very great number of inventions\r\n    which have remained inoperative for years and years, many\r\n    of which I could easily name, would have been brought to\r\n    perfection very much sooner if it had been open to all the\r\n    intellects of the country to grapple with the difficulties of\r\n    them.\r\n\r\n    “May we take it that under the present system, if a man has\r\n    obtained a Patent with little or no inquiry, although that\r\n    Patent would not stand investigation if opposed, yet if the\r\n    patentee is content to impose a moderate tax upon those who\r\n    want to use his invention, they will pay that sum without its\r\n    being worth anybody’s while to contest it?—Yes.\r\n\r\n    “Do you believe that the cases of that kind are very\r\n    numerous?—Very numerous, and the cases are still more numerous\r\n    in which the existence of a monopoly simply has the effect of\r\n    deterring other persons from following up that particular line\r\n    of improvement.”\r\n\r\nAnother effect is the restraining of publication. Hear Mr. Richard\r\nRoberts’ thrilling representations:—\r\n\r\n    “I have a list of something like 100 inventions that I should\r\n    have patented thirty or forty years ago, but for the cost.\r\n\r\n    “I could mention one by which many lives would have been saved\r\n    if I had had a Patent for it.\r\n\r\n    “I very rarely make models, but I had one made for this. It was\r\n    made many years ago. I invented it in 1830, and I mean to say\r\n    that, if it had been put into practice, things would not have\r\n    happened which have happened, and which have caused the loss of\r\n    many lives, as connected with railways.”\r\n\r\nI adduce this evidence to prove that inventions actually made are kept\r\nback just now. I don’t require to go far for a party who has two or\r\nthree small inventions (not connected with his own line of business);\r\nbut—such is our “system”—no ready means to publish, and so has for years\r\nkept them back. But a more remarkable instance is present to my mind.\r\nSince about twenty years the same party, having been then consulted by\r\nan _employé_ of a house near Birmingham, is the reticent possessor of an\r\ninventor’s secret. That inventor’s name he does not know. His invention\r\nis ingenious, and may be practicable. It affects an article of universal\r\nconsumption, and, so far as I know, has never been patented or thought of\r\nby anybody else than he who confided the secret, nor introduced to use\r\nby him, although, in my opinion, sufficiently promising to be worthy of\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nOne of the ways in which Patents hurt trade is shown by Mr. Platt:—\r\n\r\n    “Are there not some large manufacturers who like to keep the\r\n    monopoly of a Patent in their own hands, who obtain money and\r\n    go on manufacturing without granting licences to others?—Yes.”\r\n\r\nSir W. Armstrong testifies to this power to refuse licences:—\r\n\r\n    “Is it not the case that such possessor could refuse you a\r\n    licence, and so prevent you from making the improvements\r\n    altogether?—Certainly he could.”\r\n\r\nLord Chelmsford confirms the legality of this procedure:—\r\n\r\n    “If he chooses to work the Patent himself exclusively, it is\r\n    only doing what the law permits him to do.”\r\n\r\nWhere there is not downright refusal, Sir W. Armstrong shows that\r\npatentees ask too much:—\r\n\r\n    “I have known patentees very exorbitant in their demands for\r\n    licences—far beyond the merits of their inventions.\r\n\r\n    “In that case the power of fixing an exorbitant price, really\r\n    preventing the use of the article altogether, operates very\r\n    disadvantageous to the public?—No doubt of it.”\r\n\r\nSo Mr. Newton:—\r\n\r\n    “The claims of patentees are very frequently, and I may say\r\n    generally, excessive, and beyond the real value of their\r\n    inventions; but there may be cases in which new conditions of\r\n    things arise, and the invention, if invention it may be called,\r\n    becomes a matter almost of necessity, and the public must have\r\n    it. The case which has been put, I think, is a very strong one,\r\n    in which a public company or a large capitalist buys up all the\r\n    existing Patents, and thereby acquires a power which may be\r\n    exceedingly oppressive.\r\n\r\n    “... I have seen much folly in the refusal of licences. I\r\n    introduced the sewing machine into this country. I sold it for\r\n    a small sum, and I offered some years afterwards to the owner\r\n    of the Patent as much licence-money as 10_l._ per machine, and\r\n    that was refused.\r\n\r\n    “A poor man invented and patented the making of ‘cock-spurs’\r\n    (supports for dishes and plates while submitted to furnace\r\n    heat) by means of dies, and established a small business upon\r\n    the manufacture. Some years later a gentleman improved upon\r\n    the invention so far as to make the cock-spurs 500 at a time\r\n    instead of singly. The earlier Patent being brought to his\r\n    notice, he desired to make terms with the original inventor,\r\n    and offered him a liberal sum, together with the sole right to\r\n    sell the new manufacture in his own locality (the potteries).\r\n    He could not, however, be brought to accept these, or indeed\r\n    any terms; but, contrary to advice, commenced an action for\r\n    the infringement, and was cast by reason of an unimportant\r\n    claim in his specification being untenable.”\r\n\r\nAs a preventive of this abuse, and almost as a _sine quâ non_ in the\r\nPatent system, “compulsory licences” have been proposed (see the\r\nproceedings of the Social Science Association, 1858, 1860, ’61, ’62, ’63,\r\n’64), but the Royal Commission has reported against them as impracticable.\r\n\r\nNo wonder, then, that it is said the system hurts inventors themselves,\r\neven those inventors who are patentees:—\r\n\r\n    “Nothing could work greater injustice _qua_ the inventors\r\n    themselves than the present Patent-Law does. Many most\r\n    meritorious inventors under the present Patent-Law are utterly\r\n    ruined, enrich others, and never pocket a farthing themselves;\r\n    therefore the present law is as unjust as a law can be in its\r\n    practical working.”\r\n\r\nListen to the elder Brunel:—\r\n\r\n    “Almost invariably when the Patents come before the public, the\r\n    beneficial interest in them is not held, to any great extent,\r\n    by the original inventor, but that it has changed hands many\r\n    times before it comes out before the public. I should say that,\r\n    in the majority of cases, the original inventor gets little or\r\n    nothing. In most cases the original inventor has a very small\r\n    beneficial interest left in it, and in most cases I doubt\r\n    whether, even in Patents that are saleable, he is much the\r\n    gainer on the whole, taking into account his previous loss of\r\n    time and money.”\r\n\r\nSir W. Armstrong points out how, and how much, poor inventors suffer:—\r\n\r\n    “I have every week letters from inventors, and I dare say you\r\n    have the same; I have scores of them. Poor men very often come\r\n    to me imagining that they have made some great discovery. It\r\n    is generally all moonshine, or, if it looks feasible, it is\r\n    impossible to pronounce upon its value until it has passed\r\n    through that stage of preliminary investigation which involves\r\n    all the labour, and all the difficulty, and all the trouble.\r\n    Many a poor man is ruined by fancying he has made a discovery\r\n    which, by means of a Patent, will bring him a fortune. He loses\r\n    all relish for his usual pursuits, and sacrifices his earnings\r\n    to a phantom.”\r\n\r\nMr. Spence agrees:—\r\n\r\n    “I do not believe that any system of law could be devised which\r\n    would enable a poor inventor in this country to fight his own\r\n    battle. He can only fight it by interesting some capitalist,\r\n    more or less wealthy, in the probable promise of his invention;\r\n    the result is, as all know, that some ninety-eight out of every\r\n    hundred Patents end in loss to the parties and are worthless to\r\n    the public.”\r\n\r\nMr. Grove leads to the same conclusion from another point:—\r\n\r\n    “If the patentee himself was a wealthy man and a large\r\n    manufacturer, having 20, 30, or 40 Patents in his possession,\r\n    he would struggle to the utmost to maintain his Patent; he\r\n    would retain the ablest advocates and the ablest scientific\r\n    witnesses; and there would be no chance of repealing the Patent\r\n    unless the person opposing it had something like an equality\r\n    of purse to go into the field. You never could get the battle\r\n    fought if one side was wealthy, without the opposite party\r\n    having something like equal powers to oppose him.”\r\n\r\nMr. Brunel thus states his conclusion:—\r\n\r\n    “I believe them to be productive of almost unmixed evil with\r\n    respect to every party connected with them, whether those for\r\n    the benefit of whom they are apparently made, or the public.”\r\n\r\nI proceed to call attention to the effect of Patents as seen and felt\r\nin Government establishments. Before doing so I quote experience in a\r\nprivate shipbuilding-yard.\r\n\r\nMr. Hall, the eminent builder of the Aberdeen clippers, says:—\r\n\r\n    “As the sailor with his pockets full is a prey to the crimps,\r\n    so is a ship-contractor a prey to Patent-mongers—patent\r\n    windlasses, patent reefing apparatus, patent blocks, patent\r\n    rudders, patent chain-lifters, patent capstans, patent steering\r\n    gear, patent boat-lowering apparatus, patent paints, and\r\n    numberless others, all attempting to hook on to the poor\r\n    contractor. This would be no grievance, were we not aware that\r\n    most of them are patent humbugs.”\r\n\r\nLike many others, he thinks it very doubtful whether the inventor\r\n\r\n    “Would not be as well without a law which still allows the\r\n    strong to prey on the weak.”\r\n\r\nThe following is from the evidence of the Duke of Somerset:—\r\n\r\n    “I appear to bring under the notice of this Commission the\r\n    great inconvenience to the Admiralty of the present state of\r\n    the law. The inconvenience consists in the apparent facility\r\n    with which persons can obtain Patents covering a very large\r\n    number of different inventions under one Patent. For instance,\r\n    there is a Patent which one gentleman obtained some years\r\n    ago in building ships for a combination of wood and iron.\r\n    Now, it is almost impossible to build ships in these days\r\n    without a combination of wood and iron. Therefore a Patent of\r\n    that kind, where it is wide-spread, as it is in this case,\r\n    brings us continually under difficulties with this patentee.\r\n    Whenever we apply wood and iron, he is watching to see whether\r\n    or not his Patent is invaded, and he complains and says that\r\n    different improvements which we have made without any notion\r\n    of his Patent have been infringements of his Patent rights....\r\n    We do not know what Patents are now lying dormant; we never\r\n    move without knocking against several. I think that we are\r\n    stopped at every turn.... In the case of the screw-propellers\r\n    the Admiralty, in 1851, purchased five different Patents,\r\n    hoping that they should have peace by that means, but they had\r\n    all sorts of claims afterwards; they were told that they had\r\n    infringed different Patents, and they have had to pay for other\r\n    Patents since.\r\n\r\n    “Persons run and take out a Patent for what they think is\r\n    going to be done in that way. There are a great many in the\r\n    case of iron ships. I think that when the Warrior was built\r\n    there were five or six persons who all said that their Patents\r\n    were infringed, though I believe that, when the Warrior was\r\n    designed, none of their Patents were known to the designer, and\r\n    they had never been used.... They showed me different forms\r\n    of shot which had been made in the Arsenal a great many years\r\n    ago, but all of which had since then been patented by different\r\n    persons, who claimed these forms of shot under their Patents.\r\n\r\n    “Then there are cases of disputed claims by rival inventors,\r\n    which are embarrassing to a department; we do not know who has\r\n    a claim to a Patent, and sometimes when we buy a Patent of\r\n    one person we are told that we have done a great injustice to\r\n    another. I remember that when we paid for the Griffith patent\r\n    screw, which was cutting off a small portion of the screw, I\r\n    had repeated letters from Sir Howard Douglas, telling me that\r\n    it was a great injustice to him; that he had invented all\r\n    this, and that his fame was diminished, and that his rights\r\n    were taken from him by the Admiralty, who had most unjustly\r\n    and unfairly paid Mr. Griffith. Those cases are continually\r\n    arising, and of course they are very inconvenient for a\r\n    department: they not only take up a great deal of time, but\r\n    they very often prevent some very desirable process being gone\r\n    on with.”\r\n\r\nAdmiral Robinson said—\r\n\r\n    “There have been twelve upon the construction of ships since\r\n    1861.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Bush                             Construction of ships.\r\n    Mr. J. Clare                         Construction of ships.\r\n    Mr. P. Drake                         Construction of ships.\r\n    Mr. A. Lamb                          Construction of ships.\r\n    Mr. W. Rae                           Keels, stern posts, &c.\r\n    Mr. Thomas and Col. De Bathe         Mr. G. Clarke’s target.\r\n    Mr. Truss                            Animal fibre. Armour plates.\r\n    Mr. Beslay                           Preservation of iron.\r\n    Capt. Wheatley                       Position of guns in ships.\r\n    M. De Lapparent                      Carbonising timber.\r\n    Commander Warren                     Bow rudder.\r\n    Mr. Feathers                         Construction of ships.\r\n    Messrs. Woodcraft, Smith, Ericsson,  Purchase of Patents for screw\r\n      Lowe, Blaxland, and Mr. Currie.      propellers.\r\n    Capt. Carpenter                      Screw propeller.\r\n    Capt. Trewhitt                       Disconnecting apparatus.\r\n    Mr. Griffith                         Screw propeller.\r\n    Mr. J. O. Taylor                     Screw propeller.\r\n    W. Ireland                           Cupola.\r\n    Messrs. Laird and Cowper             Trimming coals in ships.\r\n    ——                                   Distilling apparatus in ‘Defence.’\r\n\r\n    “In those cases the patentees claimed compensation for\r\n    infringement?—Yes; and it was necessary for the Admiralty to\r\n    have recourse to their solicitor, and to enter into a very long\r\n    correspondence.\r\n\r\n    “It is very possible that you may infringe upon these Patents\r\n    without knowing it?—Constantly. The inconvenience which the\r\n    Duke of Somerset has mentioned resulting from Patents applied\r\n    to shipbuilding is so very great that it is scarcely possible\r\n    to build a ship, being a combination of wood and iron (and\r\n    you always have some of each in a ship), without treading\r\n    upon somebody’s Patent; and I am entirely of opinion that the\r\n    Patents are drawn up for that especial purpose, without any\r\n    idea of their being practically applied for the benefit of\r\n    the public, but only that the patentee may lie in wait for a\r\n    colourable evasion of his Patent taking place.”\r\n\r\nNow I present the evidence of General Lefroy, deputed by the War-office:—\r\n\r\n    “The expectations of patentees are very extravagant, generally\r\n    speaking, and prior to trial it is very difficult to determine\r\n    at all what is the value of an invention. As an example, a\r\n    gentleman some time ago made a great improvement in cooking\r\n    apparatus, and he assessed his own reward at a large portion\r\n    of the whole saving in fuel which might be effected by the\r\n    application of this improvement to an enormous extent upon the\r\n    whole military consumption of the Crown, which would have come\r\n    to many thousands of pounds. Such an improvement should not be\r\n    assessed by the value to the Crown, but by what it cost the\r\n    originator in intellectual labour or previous experiment, and\r\n    its importance in a large sense.”\r\n\r\nLet me next cite Mr. Clode, Solicitor to the War-office:—\r\n\r\n    “If he has not the power either of keeping those improvements\r\n    perfectly secret, or of securing them to himself by Patent,\r\n    then the War-office authorities are placed in the position\r\n    of having in all probability to pay private individuals for\r\n    inventions or improvements actually made by their own officers.”\r\n\r\nNext Mr. Abel, F.R.S., Head Chemist to the War Department:—\r\n\r\n    “In your experimental inquiries, when you have happened to\r\n    fall upon any discovery, you have not been much annoyed by\r\n    claimants saying that they have had precedence of you?—Not at\r\n    all, and it is to that that I referred in my first answer.\r\n    We do not meet practically with those embarrassments during\r\n    experiments, but we may meet with them in applying the details\r\n    of improvements. For instance, I am at present engaged upon the\r\n    working out of the application of gun cotton, the whole details\r\n    of which application were communicated as a great secret to\r\n    this Government by the Austrian Government.... While every care\r\n    was taken by this Government to keep them secret, a Patent was\r\n    taken out in this country for the whole improved process of the\r\n    manufacture.”\r\n\r\nMr. Clode again:—\r\n\r\n    “Some time after I commenced these experiments, while they\r\n    remained a perfect secret, and while every care was taken\r\n    by this Government to keep them secret, a Patent was taken\r\n    out in this country for the whole improved process of the\r\n    manufacture.... One of them who is present is experimenting\r\n    upon gun cotton, but it is with him a matter of extreme\r\n    embarrassment to know how to deal with the subject; if he\r\n    discloses by way of specification all that he knows, he sends\r\n    the invention or discovery he has made away to the winds—the\r\n    very night that it is put upon the file it goes to Paris,\r\n    Dresden, Berlin, and elsewhere. If he does not do that, he is\r\n    afraid that some man will find out precisely what he has in\r\n    view, and put a Patent on the file, and tax the Government in\r\n    that way. So that we are upon the horns of a dilemma.”\r\n\r\nIf I were now to stop, and say not a word more, I might trust to the\r\ncandour of the House for an admission that the case against Patents is\r\nproved, on the ground that the conditions of the Statute of Monopolies\r\nhave been systematically violated, these violations being of the very\r\ntexture and vitals of the institution.\r\n\r\nBut I proceed. If the House permit, I will now advert to the new\r\nphases the question has assumed since the inauguration of free trade,\r\nunderstanding by that term _le libre échange_, and not _la liberte du\r\ntravail_.\r\n\r\nThe pernicious effect of home Patents on trade with our Indian empire, is\r\nstated thus by Mr. Rendel, in 1851:—\r\n\r\n    “As engineer to the East India Railway, we had a little\r\n    inconvenience the other day; we wanted to manufacture articles\r\n    patented in this country, and we would have had to pay\r\n    Patent-rights; it was a question whether we had not better buy\r\n    the iron in India, and avoid the Patent-rights. Those cases,\r\n    I think, are constantly occurring. The Patent-Laws not being\r\n    applicable to India, people will not unfrequently order things\r\n    to be manufactured in India to avoid the licence dues in this\r\n    country; and the consequence was that I made an arrangement\r\n    with the patentees at about one-half of the ordinary charge for\r\n    the Patent in this country.”\r\n\r\nIn 1851 it was proposed, and in 1852 an Act was passed, to limit British\r\nPatents to the United Kingdom, with exclusion of the Colonies. This\r\nchange was desired by an influential and intelligent portion of the West\r\nIndia Association. Their conduct contradicted, and their experience\r\nproves the fallacy of, the allegation so confidently made and repeated\r\nin spite of its futility, by some interested or else ignorant parties,\r\nthat inventions thrive most where Patents exist—_i.e._, where trade\r\nis trammelled with prohibitions or burdened with royalties. The home\r\nsugar refiners exclaimed against an exemption which, being partial,\r\noperated against their trade. The following is an extract from one of the\r\npetitions presented by that body:—\r\n\r\n    “That, so far as regards home manufacturers and producers, such\r\n    a change of the immemorial usages of the kingdom is virtually\r\n    a bestowal on parties carrying on the same businesses in the\r\n    colonies of a right to use patented inventions fourteen years\r\n    sooner than they.\r\n\r\n    “That if, at any time, the British Parliament might have put\r\n    home manufacturers on such an unfavourable footing, surely\r\n    this cannot be supposed under free-trade and equalised duties,\r\n    when they must task their utmost energies, and adopt every\r\n    improvement in mechanism and processes, in order to maintain\r\n    their ground.\r\n\r\n    “That the use of future Patents, at the rates that have been\r\n    freely paid by sugar refiners for Patents granted before now\r\n    would subject each sugar house, of average size, to a payment\r\n    of about £3,000 a year.\r\n\r\n    “That to exempt their competitors in the colonies from such a\r\n    tax (for tax it is, payable by order of, though not to, the\r\n    State) is really to give them a bounty of that very large\r\n    amount.\r\n\r\n    “That, in so far as patent fees may be considered a premium\r\n    for stimulating improvements, an equal share of the benefit is\r\n    enjoyed by the colonists, who, therefore, should bear a due\r\n    share of the burden.”\r\n\r\nSoon after that time, protection having ceased, the unfairness of\r\nburdening British manufacturers came more vividly into sight. How can\r\nthey compete with Prussia and Switzerland? Here is evidence regarding\r\nthose countries. From a Prussian witness:—\r\n\r\n    “I am a member of the Board of Trade and Commerce, and at the\r\n    same time a member of the Patent Commission.\r\n\r\n    “Will you be good enough to state what is the system adopted in\r\n    Prussia with regard to protection to inventions?—We have the\r\n    principle in our country to give as much liberty as possible to\r\n    every branch of industry and art, and, considering every sort\r\n    of Patent as an hindrance to their free development, we are not\r\n    very liberal in granting them. We merely grant a Patent for a\r\n    discovery of a completely novel invention, or real improvement\r\n    in existing inventions.”\r\n\r\nFrom an important Swiss witness:—\r\n\r\n    “There is no want of persons to import them into Switzerland,\r\n    although those persons thus importing them obtain no\r\n    monopoly?—When a Patent is taken out in France or England, the\r\n    process is published; therefore it becomes the property of the\r\n    public in Switzerland; the Swiss have access to the French or\r\n    English Patents.\r\n\r\n    “In that way the Swiss have the benefit of the invention\r\n    without the charge of the licence?—Yes.\r\n\r\n    “And so far they have an advantage?—Certainly.\r\n\r\n    “When inventions in the watchmaking trade are made in France,\r\n    are they immediately introduced into Switzerland?—I should\r\n    think so, if they are useful.”\r\n\r\nHow, I ask, can British manufacturers compete with Prussia, which\r\nprudently grants less than 100 Patents in a-year; or with Saxony, which\r\ngrants only about 134; or the Netherlands, which grant only about 42?\r\nRather, I may ask, how can they compete with other countries in general,\r\neven those that grant Patents freely, seeing that it is not incumbent on\r\nthe British patentee to take a Patent in any other country whatsoever;\r\nseeing also that, unlike some countries which grant Patents, we in most\r\ncases do not terminate the currency of those we grant at the time when\r\nthe Patents taken elsewhere expire? Honourable members will understand\r\nhow serious is the disadvantage under which our manufacturers, and\r\nwith them, of course, the labourers and artisans who co-operate in\r\nmanufactures, are placed if they are precluded from using inventions\r\nwhich their continental rivals may use. When licences are given by\r\npatentees, the disadvantage is lessened, but not very greatly. The\r\nHouse will agree when it hears how enormous are the royalties sometimes\r\nexacted. For a set of inventions in the iron trade, which is not the\r\nsubject of Patents in Prussia, a single firm is said to be paying at the\r\nrate of £16,000 every quarter. Let me quote from a leading article in the\r\n_Engineer_:—\r\n\r\n    “Owing to the invalidation of his Austrian Patents, Mr.\r\n    Bessemer derives no pecuniary benefit from the working of\r\n    his inventions in that country. This is also the state of\r\n    things in Prussia, whose really iniquitously-managed Patent\r\n    Commission have refused to give Mr. Bessemer any Patent at\r\n    all. The great Prussian steel works there manufacture Bessemer\r\n    steel unweighted by any royalty. We regret this, not merely\r\n    for Mr. Bessemer’s sake, but also on public grounds. Our steel\r\n    makers are thus heavily handicapped in the industrial race with\r\n    royalties of from one to even three pounds per ton.”\r\n\r\nSee a confirmation of this in the following piece of a private letter:—\r\n\r\n    “The very heavy royalty payable under Bessemer’s Patent does,\r\n    to a very great extent, prevent English manufacturers competing\r\n    on the Continent for steel rails; but, from the accidental\r\n    circumstance of continental manufacturers being obliged to buy\r\n    a considerable portion of their raw material from this country,\r\n    we have not been exposed to competition in England, as the cost\r\n    of carriage backwards and forwards about equalled the benefit\r\n    which the Germans enjoyed of paying no royalty.”\r\n\r\nThe sugar-refiners, in a printed document before me, put the case,\r\nconvincingly no doubt to all who will consider how small is the\r\npercentage margin of profit in great businesses:—\r\n\r\n    “If, for any invention, French producers of refined sugar\r\n    should have only royalties of one per cent. _ad valorem_, while\r\n    the British should have to pay royalties of five per cent., it\r\n    is obvious the Patent-Law may in effect impose on the latter a\r\n    most onerous differential duty.”\r\n\r\nIn that trade I myself, shortly before my retiring from commerce, paid\r\n£3,000 for a year’s right to use a new process, which proved unworkable,\r\nand had to pay a _solatium_ of £1,000 for leave to discontinue it.\r\n\r\nThe agricultural interest should not remain indifferent. Mark what was\r\ntold the Commission by Mr. Reeve, Registrar to the Privy Council. In\r\nMr. Bovill’s Patent there was charged a royalty of 6d. a quarter on all\r\nthe corn ground in Great Britain by millers who thought it desirable to\r\nadopt his plan. Obviously the royalty in that case had the effect of a\r\nprotective duty leviable for individual benefit, and enabling foreigners\r\nto undersell in the British markets. And what title to this power had\r\nMr. Bovill? He was not the inventor. Another case is exhibited in the\r\nfollowing extract from a private letter with which I am favoured, from a\r\nhighly respectable quarter:—\r\n\r\n    “Patents have become so numerous and so various, that it is\r\n    not safe to use any piece of machinery, or make any variation\r\n    without first making a careful search to ascertain whether it\r\n    is not protected by a Patent. The Patent-Law has also been\r\n    the cause of much litigation, there being very few Patents of\r\n    any real worth but have had to go through the ordeal of the\r\n    Law Courts, and there can be little doubt that injustice has\r\n    frequently been done both to patentees and to the public. A\r\n    case of considerable hardship connected with our own trade\r\n    occurred regarding the application of the exhaust to grinding\r\n    purposes. It was clearly proved at the trial that the machine\r\n    for which the patentee claimed protection had been in public\r\n    use in Denmark, where it had been seen by a Glasgow miller,\r\n    who erected a similar machine on his premises in Glasgow,\r\n    but hastily threw it aside without putting it to a proper\r\n    test prior to the date of the Patent, but it was held that no\r\n    profitable use having been made of the machine by the Glasgow\r\n    miller, the Patent was good and perfectly protected. In our\r\n    opinion a Patent obtained in such circumstances should never\r\n    be allowed to stand, and if some means could be devised for\r\n    ascertaining the circumstances beforehand, it should never be\r\n    granted. The trade suffered very considerably in consequence\r\n    of this Patent being sustained, and the consequence was,\r\n    that although the patentee was not the original inventor, he\r\n    pocketed a very large sum of money.\r\n\r\n    “A more recent instance has occurred, however, of a large sum\r\n    being pocketed by parties not the inventors of the article\r\n    patented. We can, however, only give you the figures as\r\n    popularly reported, without vouching for their accuracy, and in\r\n    relating the story we shall endeavour to reply to your queries\r\n    _seriatim_. 1st, The patented article is a machine for dressing\r\n    millstones by means of a black diamond, or piece of ‘bort,’\r\n    instead of by the hand with picks. It was originally patented\r\n    in France by the party said to be the inventor, and shortly\r\n    afterwards was patented by him in this country. 2nd and 3rd,\r\n    A Leith commission agent (a German) and an Edinburgh miller\r\n    saw the machine in the Paris Exhibition of 1867, and induced\r\n    the patentee to bring it over to Scotland for trial, and\r\n    ultimately they, in conjunction with a third party, purchased\r\n    the patentee’s right for the whole kingdom for £4,000. 4th,\r\n    These parties immediately put the machine in the market, and\r\n    it was at once seized hold of by speculators, who readily gave\r\n    most extraordinary sums for it. One party is said to have paid\r\n    £40,000 for the right for a dozen counties in England; another\r\n    £15,000 for three counties; and another £20,000 for some\r\n    counties in Ireland: the whole sum realised by the original\r\n    purchasers amounting, it is said, to upwards of £150,000. 5th,\r\n    The consequence is, that such enormous sums having been paid\r\n    by the speculators, the trade can only get the use of the\r\n    machine by paying a most exorbitant price, and hitherto it has\r\n    remained all but a dead letter. We cannot give you in round\r\n    numbers the amount expected to be realised by the speculators,\r\n    but the price originally charged by them would have yielded\r\n    four or five times the amount they paid if the whole trade had\r\n    become purchasers. This machine has not yet been the subject of\r\n    litigation, but there is every probability that it soon will\r\n    be.”\r\n\r\nBut I can reproduce a case where the effect was far, far worse,\r\ncommunicated to me in a private letter:—\r\n\r\n    “The patentee of the Howard series of improvements in\r\n    sugar-refining granted licences to houses in Liverpool and\r\n    Hull, with a condition in each case that he would not grant a\r\n    licence to any party carrying on business within seventy miles\r\n    of either town. A sugar refiner of long standing, established\r\n    in Sheffield, applied for a licence, and was refused for the\r\n    reason above stated, Sheffield being just within the prescribed\r\n    distance. The consequence was, he had to carry on his\r\n    manufacture for nearly fourteen years on the old system; and\r\n    during this period sustained great losses by working, which he,\r\n    as well as parties cognisant with the facts, attributed to the\r\n    disadvantage he was compelled to carry on under. His fortune\r\n    disappeared, and he became insolvent.—I am, &c.\r\n\r\n    “Sheffield, December 17, 1863.”\r\n\r\nThis distressing result will, I trust, drive home the conviction that,\r\ngreat as is the evil of multiplying Patents, it would be but a mitigation\r\nnot worthy of being looked to as a cure, to get the number lessened.\r\n\r\nIf in an earlier part of this address I have shown that the condition\r\nnot to produce “general inconvenience” has been preposterously set at\r\nnought, surely these passages prove no less conclusively that there\r\nhas been equal disregard of the condition not to “hurt trade.” I will\r\nsatisfy myself, and I hope the House, with one extract only to prove what\r\nI apprehend is the rule rather than the exception, that Patents offend\r\nagainst the other condition, not to “raise prices.” It is from a paper\r\nread by Mr. Lowry Whittle before the Statistical Society of Dublin:—\r\n\r\n    “I was informed lately of a case in the North of England where\r\n    a successful patentee produced a machine at the cost of £200\r\n    for working in the linen trade. On this machine his royalty is\r\n    £1,000.”\r\n\r\nI may give one instance from my own experience, where the pretensions\r\nof the applicant for a Patent were equal to about a farthing a pound on\r\nall the sugar that the process perfected. The House may understand the\r\nhardship this would inflict on the population when told that it was for\r\nthe use of a single process only, or rather of a machine invented by\r\nanother, an engineer firm, who had overlooked, and not included in their\r\nPatent, its applicability to sugar. My experience in that case was very\r\ninstructive. Pardon my introducing a few particulars. I have no reason\r\nto think the idea of applying the machine to the refining of sugar was\r\noriginal; on the contrary, it had been already made practical on the\r\nContinent. Nor was the idea patented by my friend alone; on the contrary,\r\nto several persons it had occurred, by some (I forget how many) it had\r\nbeen patented. One of my partners and I had a good deal of travelling\r\nin England and Scotland, when we discovered the first patentee of the\r\napplication at length. We traced the indubitable priority home to a\r\ngood neighbour, whose office was within a bow-shot of a sugar-house of\r\nwhich I myself was managing partner. He told me, when I called about his\r\nPatent, that he had not attended to it for years. I regret to be able\r\nto add that he was afterwards led, by representations which I will not\r\ncharacterise, to part with his privilege—it was really a very valuable\r\none—for a most inadequate consideration, to a person who had applied\r\nfor a parasitical Patent for something, the value of which could not\r\nbe substantiated. Perhaps the worst of all is, that the really most\r\nmeritorious person, the patentee of the machine, got comparatively\r\nlittle advantage from its new but natural application. A coalition was\r\nformed whose terms violated one of the conditions to which I have called\r\nattention, by charging an exorbitant price for the machines, and, what is\r\nthe greatest mischief of Patents as now administered, by further charging\r\nhigh royalties proportioned to the quantity of work they did.\r\n\r\nNow will the House consider why it subjects the nation to all this\r\ninconvenience, loss, and expense? It is not because without it we would\r\nmiss many important inventions. The groundlessness of such a fear has\r\nalready been indicated with sufficient plainness.\r\n\r\nThe House can hardly doubt, from its individual acquaintance with what\r\ngoes on in the world, and from the extracts I have troubled it with,\r\nthat whatever argument in favour of maintaining a Patent system may\r\nbe founded on the claims of inventors, the material interests of the\r\nnation would suffer little from the cessation of Patents as a stimulus.\r\nUnquestionably, if the system induces some inventions to be made and\r\npublished, it deters others. What we gain is a matter of doubt. That much\r\ninconvenience is inflicted by it, and much disadvantage and very heavy\r\nburdens, is no matter of doubt. It is a case in which we have to balance\r\nthe positive disadvantages against the supposed advantages. To enable the\r\nHouse to weigh these, by seeing how few inventions we would lose by total\r\nabolition, a few more quotations may be permitted.\r\n\r\nVery significantly Mr. Richard Roberts answers:—\r\n\r\n    “Would the absence of Patents for inventions, in your judgment,\r\n    have any effect in producing secret trades; or have you had\r\n    any opportunity of judging whether non-patented inventions are\r\n    used much in secret trade?—I do not think there is much secret\r\n    trade, but I know this, that no trade can be kept secret long;\r\n    a quart of ale will do wonders in that way.”\r\n\r\nLet me adduce Mr. Woodcroft:—\r\n\r\n    “Do you think there is any natural tendency or propensity in\r\n    inventors to keep to themselves their inventions, or have they\r\n    a natural tendency to make them known?—The natural tendency of\r\n    an inventive mind is to make the invention known.”\r\n\r\nI now adduce the late able Mr. Fairrie:—\r\n\r\n    “You believe that the same energy of mind would be displayed,\r\n    and the same anxiety to make new discoveries felt, whether\r\n    there were this hope of protection or not?—I think so; in the\r\n    case of manufacturers certainly. I think the great bulk of\r\n    improvements proceed from the manufacturers themselves, and not\r\n    from mere inventors.”\r\n\r\nHear Colonel Reid, so well entitled to speak:—\r\n\r\n    “Supposing the law were so modified as to make the acquisition\r\n    of a Patent easy and simple, and to provide for the publication\r\n    at the earliest possible period, do not you think there would\r\n    be more inducement to the disclosure of the secret under such a\r\n    system than if all privileges of the kind were abolished?—I am\r\n    inclined to think that the advance in improvement in all our\r\n    arts would be greater by leaving them entirely unshackled.”\r\n\r\nSir W. Cubitt was asked—\r\n\r\n    “Have you ever been an inventor yourself?—Yes, of many things;\r\n    but a patented inventor of but one.\r\n\r\n    “You have taken out a Patent?—I took out a Patent in the year\r\n    1807.\r\n\r\n    “Has your attention been at all directed to the advantages or\r\n    disadvantages of the present system?—Yes, it has been drawn to\r\n    the subject very frequently indeed; but the more it was drawn\r\n    to it, and the more I saw of it, the less I approved of it; but\r\n    with that disapproval I could not satisfy myself how to devise\r\n    anything much better; whether to make alterations, or whether\r\n    to do away with Patents altogether would be best, I can hardly\r\n    determine.\r\n\r\n    “Will you state, generally, your objections to the present\r\n    system?—The objections to the present system are the very\r\n    advanced state of scientific and practical knowledge, which\r\n    renders it difficult to secure anything. The principles of\r\n    mechanism being very well known and very well understood,\r\n    inventions involving exactly the same principle and to effect\r\n    the same object may be practically and apparently so different,\r\n    that Patents may be taken out for what is only a difference in\r\n    form, intended to produce the same effect, without there being\r\n    any difference in principle.”\r\n\r\nSo Sir W. Armstrong:—\r\n\r\n    “My firm conviction is, that if there was no artificial reward\r\n    for invention you would have just as much as at present.”\r\n\r\nMr. Grove perhaps goes at least part of the way:—\r\n\r\n    “The Patent is to encourage invention; if, therefore, you would\r\n    get the same inventions as we now get without Letters Patent,\r\n    I would have no Letters Patent at all. I believe that, with\r\n    respect to the minor class of inventions, you would get them.”\r\n\r\nMr. Platt also has his doubts:—\r\n\r\n    “Is not almost every Patent which is now granted a Patent for\r\n    an improvement?—A great many Patents are granted for things\r\n    which are no improvement at all.\r\n\r\n    “I would simply limit the Patent-Law to that extent. I think\r\n    there are so many Patents granted that it is a great question\r\n    with me, I confess, if Patents for these combinations are\r\n    to be granted, whether it would not be better to abolish\r\n    the Patent-Laws altogether, as it becomes such a nuisance in\r\n    conducting a large business.”\r\n\r\nHow emphatic was Mr. I. Kingdom Brunel:—\r\n\r\n    “Do you think that there would be an equal inducement for a\r\n    man to turn his attention to improvements if there were no\r\n    Patent-Laws, as compared with the present state of things,\r\n    which lead him to the expectation and hope that he will obtain\r\n    some exclusive advantage from the discovery of some new\r\n    improvement?\r\n\r\n    “I feel certain of it; I have felt it very strongly, and\r\n    it always struck me as surprising that it was not seen by\r\n    everybody else; but we have so long been in the habit of\r\n    considering that the granting of an exclusive privilege to a\r\n    man who invents a thing is just and fair, that I do not think\r\n    the public have ever considered whether it was, after all,\r\n    advantageous to him. My feeling is, that it is very injurious\r\n    to him.\r\n\r\n    “My impression is, that in every class of inventions you\r\n    would practically in the end have a more rapid supply and\r\n    increase of inventions than you have now; I believe that men\r\n    of science, and all those who do it for pleasure as well as\r\n    for profit, would produce more, they would be less interfered\r\n    with by existing Patents, and they would really produce more; I\r\n    believe that the working class, the smaller class of inventors,\r\n    would introduce very much more. With respect to that class\r\n    of inventions, which I believe to be very few in number,\r\n    though they are talked of very much, which really involve\r\n    long-continued expenses, I believe they would probably be\r\n    brought about in a different manner. I wish, however, to have\r\n    it understood that I limit my observations to the present state\r\n    of things. I do not wish to express any opinion as to what\r\n    might have been formerly the effects of Patents, or whether\r\n    they did originally encourage inventions or not. I believe that\r\n    in the first place they are very prejudicial, on the whole, to\r\n    a large class supposed to exist of inventors, and principally\r\n    from these circumstances: the present state of things is this,\r\n    that in all branches, whether in manufactures or arts of any\r\n    sort, we are in such an advanced state, and every process in\r\n    every production consists of such a combination of the results\r\n    of the improvements which have been effected within the last\r\n    twenty or thirty years, that a good invention now is rarely a\r\n    new idea.”\r\n\r\nSo likewise Mr. James Spence:—\r\n\r\n    “The evils of the present system are serious. There is a charm\r\n    in the name of a Patent which entices large numbers of men to\r\n    neglect their own affairs in pursuit of some phantom. Where\r\n    intellectual power exists of an inventive character, it will\r\n    develop itself without any spur; it is, indeed, irrepressible\r\n    in its nature. To such minds the stimulus of a Patent is\r\n    superfluous.\r\n\r\n    “Besides the progress of the arts, another change has occurred\r\n    which affects this question. Formerly improvements made slow\r\n    progress, and unless an inventor were protected for many\r\n    years he had little chance of recompense. Now the power of\r\n    advertising is so great and intelligence is so diffused, that\r\n    any really useful invention can be brought immediately into\r\n    operation and profit. Were Patents abolished, any one with an\r\n    invention of value could find a manufacturer to take it up. It\r\n    is true it would be open to the rest of the world as soon as\r\n    found out, but the manufacturer would obtain the first start\r\n    of all others, in itself a profit. Under the present system\r\n    the legal protection breaks down in practice. The moment a\r\n    specification is published, competing manufacturers strain\r\n    their wits to contrive how to reach the same result through\r\n    other means or modifications; in other words, how to infringe.\r\n    Against this the patentee has no remedy, except proceedings at\r\n    law of the most costly nature.\r\n\r\n    “No change can be proposed in Patent-Law that will not be open\r\n    to objections based on individual cases of hardship; but, on a\r\n    comprehensive view of the subject in all its bearings, I hold\r\n    that it would benefit the country to abolish the system _in\r\n    toto_. Manufacturers would be relieved from present perplexity,\r\n    delusions would no longer be kept up by excitement, an enormous\r\n    waste of money would be stayed; and whilst the mass of\r\n    worthless Patents would disappear, any of real value would be\r\n    taken up on its merits and produce sufficient remuneration to\r\n    the inventor.”\r\n\r\nThe Report of the Commission, founded on the evidence of which I have\r\nshown the general character, contains the following just observations:—\r\n\r\n    “The majority of witnesses, however, decidedly affirm the\r\n    existence of practical inconvenience from the multiplicity of\r\n    Patents. It is clear that Patents are granted for matters which\r\n    can hardly be considered as coming within the definition, in\r\n    the Statute of Monopolies, of ‘a new manufacture.’ It is in\r\n    evidence that the existence of these monopolies embarrasses\r\n    the trade of a considerable class of persons, artisans, small\r\n    tradesmen, and others, who cannot afford to face the expense\r\n    of litigation, however weak the case against them may seem to\r\n    be; and a still stronger case is made out as to the existence\r\n    of what may be called obstructive Patents, and as to the\r\n    inconvenience caused thereby to manufacturers directly, and\r\n    through them to the public.\r\n\r\n    “Other instances will be found in the evidence of particular\r\n    manufactures and branches of invention which are so blocked up\r\n    by Patents, that not only are inventors deterred from taking\r\n    them up with a view to improvement, but the manufacturer, in\r\n    carrying on his regular course of trade, is hampered by owners\r\n    of worthless Patents, whom it is generally more convenient\r\n    to buy off than to resist. The evil also results in another\r\n    practice, having the same obstructive tendency—namely, that of\r\n    combination amongst a number of persons of the same trade to\r\n    buy up all the Patents relating to it, and to pay the expense\r\n    of attacking subsequent improvers out of a common fund. From a\r\n    comparison of evidence, it cannot be doubted that this practice\r\n    prevails to a considerable extent. We must also conclude that\r\n    when the obstruction is not to be got rid of without the\r\n    expense and annoyance of litigation, in a large majority of\r\n    cases the manufacturer submits to an exaction, rather than\r\n    incur the alternative.\r\n\r\n    “We desire to call special attention to the evidence given by\r\n    the First Lord of the Admiralty, and by various witnesses on\r\n    behalf of the War Department, showing the embarrassment which\r\n    has been caused to the naval and military services by the\r\n    multitude of Patents taken out for inventions in use in those\r\n    departments.\r\n\r\n    “It has long been the practice, founded on judicial decision,\r\n    to consider that the use or publication of an invention\r\n    abroad did not deprive that invention of the character of ‘a\r\n    new manufacture within this realm.’ It appears to us, and is\r\n    generally admitted in the evidence, that the present facilities\r\n    of communication subsisting between all parts of the world have\r\n    done away with the only valid reason for such a construction of\r\n    the words of the Statute of Monopolies. The object of allowing\r\n    such Patents might fairly be, in an age of slow international\r\n    communication, to encourage enterprising persons to go in\r\n    search of, and to introduce to this country, useful processes\r\n    employed abroad, but not otherwise likely to be adopted here,\r\n    for the want of which we should long have been behind other\r\n    nations. It does not, however, seem worth while to continue\r\n    the same facilities now, when foreign inventions are most\r\n    frequently patented in this country and in their native land\r\n    simultaneously; especially, as we are well informed, that one\r\n    result of the practice is to encourage unscrupulous persons to\r\n    steal the inventions of foreigners and to run a race with the\r\n    legitimate owner to get them patented here.”\r\n\r\nThe extracts which I have culled sufficiently prove that, in the opinion\r\nof men selected because they were competent to speak with authority on\r\naccount of their character, ability, and experience, our Patent system\r\nis “generally inconvenient” and is “hurtful to trade.” Being so, it\r\nis inconsistent with the conditions on faith of which, while other\r\nmonopolies were prohibited by the Act, it was spared. But I rest my\r\ncase on absolute evils, without regard to that inconsistency. I am sure\r\nnobody can go over the evidence as a whole, or even those scraps of\r\nevidence which I have presented—I am well aware in a very promiscuous\r\nand ineffective manner—without becoming convinced that the trade and\r\nmanufactures of this country are seriously obstructed, fettered,\r\nretarded, harassed, and burdened, sometimes demoralised, often wronged,\r\nor even robbed, by the multitude and vexatious character of Patents,\r\nand by the claims and conduct of patentees;—that these Patents, though\r\nvery numerous, in general possess little merit, yet often produce large\r\nrevenues, the result of exactions from persons who use them, to the\r\nassignees, rather than to the original grantees,—that the uncertainty\r\nof receiving a good return (in place of which experience shows there\r\nis, in most cases, disappointment or even positive loss), and the utter\r\nincongruity existing between the earnings, where there are any, and\r\nthe merits of inventions, render the system of Patents an exceedingly\r\nunsatisfactory way of stimulating invention or rewarding inventors;—and\r\nthat there is wide-spread dissatisfaction with things as they are, yet\r\ndespair of amendment, among the most intelligent of those portions of the\r\ncommunity for whose benefit the system is plausibly represented to exist.\r\n\r\nThe evidence goes to show that the poor man and the working man suffer\r\nin two ways. Such cannot bring their inventions into play for want of\r\ncapital, and they could not, even if it were in that respect different,\r\nmake head against rich infringers who are able by the costliness of law\r\nproceedings to set them at defiance. I might allege, also, that while the\r\nexpenses of patenting are clearly too heavy to suit the circumstances\r\nof the poor, there is little or no favour shown by any influential\r\nwitnesses to propositions for reducing them, because of the tendency that\r\na suitable reduction would have to still further multiply Patents. Surely\r\nthis indicates sufficiently that there is something radically wrong in\r\nthe principle on which we proceed.\r\n\r\nAllow me, while adverting to the case of the poor, to express my belief\r\nthat the Patent system has an effect on wages which demands the serious\r\nconsideration of the friends of working men. I believe it helps to\r\nkeep wages low. The abolition would work in this manner: whenever, in\r\nany establishment, an improvement is introduced, the fact of its use\r\nbecomes, of course, speedily known throughout the establishment and in\r\nother establishments. The _employés_ who in their ordinary occupations\r\nmust come to know what the improvement is and how to work according to\r\nit—for this is a matter of necessity, especially now that operations are\r\nconducted on a large scale, with the indispensable aid of men intelligent\r\nand independent—very soon find they are in request. To prevent their\r\nleaving, they are offered an advance, which itself in its turn may\r\nbe outbid. The rise which indisputably would result in the case of\r\nindividuals will, in my opinion, tend towards a general rise. If I am\r\ncorrect in my anticipations, operatives and artisans are much injured\r\nby Patent-Laws. But independently of this hypothetical advantage, a\r\ngood system of dealing with inventors will be beneficial directly to\r\noperatives, by removing from trade the present hindrances.\r\n\r\nHaving seen how little store there is set on Patents by eminent\r\nengineers, by manufacturers, and by the public services, let me appeal to\r\neminent statesmen. Among these I name foremost the apostle of free-trade.\r\nMr. Cobden told me, many years ago, that he was opposed to Patents; and\r\nat a later period, Oct., 1862, he wrote:—\r\n\r\n    “I have a growing doubt of the value and justice of the\r\n    system, whether as regards the interests of the public or the\r\n    inventors.”\r\n\r\nLord Granville, then Vice-President of the Board of Trade, the Chairman\r\nof the Committee on the Patent Bills, told the House of Lords, on July 1,\r\n1851—\r\n\r\n    “The last witness was the Master of the Rolls, who,\r\n    notwithstanding the experience he had had as one of the law\r\n    officers of the Crown in administering the Patent-Laws, and\r\n    although he took charge of the first Bill which the Government\r\n    proposed on the subject, was decidedly of opinion that\r\n    Patent-Laws were bad in principle, and were of no advantage\r\n    either to the public or inventors.... All the evidence that\r\n    had been brought before the Committee, both of the gentlemen\r\n    who were opposed to the system of Patents and those who were\r\n    most strongly in favour of it, had only tended to confirm\r\n    his previous opinion that the whole system is unadvisable\r\n    for the public, disadvantageous to inventors, and wrong in\r\n    principle. The result of the experience acquired by the present\r\n    Vice-Chancellor and Lord Chief Justice of the Queen’s Bench\r\n    had raised great doubts in their minds as to whether a law of\r\n    Patents was advantageous. The Chief Justice of the Common Pleas\r\n    likewise had written him a letter, which he authorised him to\r\n    make what public use of he pleased, declaring his concurrence\r\n    in his opinion that a law of Patents was neither advantageous\r\n    to the public nor useful to inventors.... The only persons,\r\n    he believed, who derived any advantage from the Patent-Laws\r\n    were members of the legal profession. Except perhaps warranty\r\n    of horses, there was no subject which offered so many\r\n    opportunities for sharp practice as the law of Patents. As\r\n    regards scientific men, too, the practice of summoning them as\r\n    witnesses on trials respecting Patents had an injurious, if not\r\n    a demoralising, effect.... They sometimes allowed themselves to\r\n    be betrayed into giving a more favourable opinion of the merits\r\n    of an invention than was strictly accurate.”\r\n\r\nLord Harrowby judiciously said, in reference to the proposition then for\r\nthe first time made to exempt the Colonies from the incidence of British\r\nPatents—\r\n\r\n    “The colonial refiner would be enabled to avail himself of\r\n    every new invention in the manufacture of sugar, to the\r\n    prejudice of the home refiner, who would have to pay for the\r\n    Patent-right.”\r\n\r\nLord Campbell—\r\n\r\n    “Having been some years a law officer of the Crown, had some\r\n    experience as regarded the question at issue, and he begged to\r\n    say that he entirely approved of the view of his noble friend,\r\n    Earl Granville.”\r\n\r\nSir James Graham, on Aug. 5 of the same year, observed—\r\n\r\n    “There was also evidently great division of opinion among Her\r\n    Majesty’s Ministers upon this subject. The Vice-President of\r\n    the Board of Trade, in the House of Lords, when introducing\r\n    this Bill, expressed a decided opinion adverse to the principle\r\n    of Patents altogether. The noble Secretary for the Colonies\r\n    (Earl Grey) agreed with the Vice-President of the Board of\r\n    Trade, and now it was found that the advisers of the Crown had\r\n    put an end altogether to Patents in the colonies. Was it right,\r\n    then, to continue a system in England which had been condemned\r\n    in principle by the advisers of the Crown? And were they to\r\n    legislate upon a question which the divisions in Her Majesty’s\r\n    Council rendered still more doubtful?”\r\n\r\nMr. Cardwell, sensibly and patriotically,\r\n\r\n    “Would remind the House of the case of the sugar-refiners of\r\n    Liverpool, who complained of this part of the Bill.”\r\n\r\nI need not quote Mr. Ricardo, whose lamented death prevented him from\r\nurging the present subject as he intended. Allow only the following\r\nobservations of Mr. Roche, who on the same occasion—\r\n\r\n    “Entirely agreed that the Patent-Laws should be abolished\r\n    altogether. They might depend on it that nine-tenths of the\r\n    Patent inventions, under any law that could be passed, would\r\n    be nothing less than so many stumbling-blocks in the way of\r\n    improvement.”\r\n\r\nHere is an extract from the proceedings of the British Association at\r\nGlasgow:—\r\n\r\n    “Mr. Archibald Smith was convinced that a majority of\r\n    scientific men and the public were in favour of a repeal of the\r\n    Patent-Law, and he believed its days were numbered. He held it\r\n    was the interest of the public, and not the patentees, that\r\n    should be consulted in the matter. This was a growing opinion\r\n    amongst lawyers and young men of his acquaintance.”\r\n\r\nI revert to the injurious influence of Patents in incapacitating\r\nmanufacturers to compete with their foreign rivals, and am able to submit\r\nContinental testimony that such is the inevitable effect. The following\r\nlengthy quotation will suffice from M. Legrand, Auditor of the Council of\r\nState of France:—\r\n\r\n    “There is in this institution not only an obstacle to the\r\n    development of home trade, but also a shackle on foreign\r\n    commerce.\r\n\r\n    “The doors which we open by our Treaties of Commerce may by\r\n    means of Patents be closed.\r\n\r\n    “Let an invention be freely worked in Belgium; if in France\r\n    it be patented, Belgian produce cannot enter there. Let\r\n    the contrary be the case; we cannot export to Belgium the\r\n    production which is free with us, but patented at Brussels.\r\n\r\n    “Let us suppose, for example, that a new colour is patented\r\n    alone in France, and that the patentee only permits the\r\n    manufacture of the colour on payment of a high royalty: this\r\n    colour will become dear, to the profit of the patentee alone,\r\n    and the detriment of all; its exportation, or the exportation\r\n    of articles dyed with this colour, into a country where the\r\n    manufacture is free, will become impossible, because in that\r\n    country they will begin to fabricate it, and its price will be\r\n    diminished to the extent of the royalty exacted for it by the\r\n    patentee.\r\n\r\n    “The French producer will necessarily be placed in such a\r\n    situation that he will be unable to sustain any foreign\r\n    competition.\r\n\r\n    “It is of consequence, so far as it depends on legislators,\r\n    to place those countries on the same footing who unite in the\r\n    peaceful, beneficent struggle of competition.\r\n\r\n    “But with the sound notions which prevail amongst persons of\r\n    intelligence, it is evident that the uniform solution to which\r\n    every one would adhere cannot be one which would recognise\r\n    Patents.\r\n\r\n    “The making all discoveries free is the system which alone\r\n    would have the chance of being adopted by all nations.\r\n\r\n    “It would certainly put an end to more injustice than it would\r\n    originate.”\r\n\r\nI had the pleasure of being present at a numerously-attended meeting\r\nof the Economists of Germany held at Dresden in 1863, which almost\r\nunanimously adopted a resolution against all Patents; quite in harmony,\r\nI may say, with formal resolutions of commercial and industrial\r\nassociations in that country and France.\r\n\r\nThe House must long ago have been prepared for the following conclusions,\r\nwhich close the Royal Commission’s Report on the Law relating to Letters\r\nPatent for Inventions:—\r\n\r\n    “That in all Patents hereafter to be granted a proviso shall\r\n    be inserted to the effect that the Crown shall have the power\r\n    to use any invention therein patented without previous licence\r\n    or consent of the patentee, subject to payment of a sum to be\r\n    fixed by the Treasury.\r\n\r\n    “While, in the judgment of the Commissioners, the changes above\r\n    suggested will do something to mitigate the inconveniences\r\n    now generally complained of by the public as incident to the\r\n    working of the Patent-Law, it is their opinion that these\r\n    inconveniences cannot be wholly removed. They are, in their\r\n    belief, inherent in the nature of a Patent-Law, and must be\r\n    considered as the price which the public consents to pay for\r\n    the existence of such a law.”\r\n\r\nThis is signed by Lord Stanley, Lord Overstone, Sir W. Erle, Lord\r\nHatherley, Lord Cairns, H. Waddington, W. R. Grove, W. E. Forster, Wm.\r\nFairbairn.\r\n\r\nThe public understood this to mean that the Commission were by no means\r\nsatisfied that there should be any longer any Patent-Law at all. The\r\n_Journal of Jurisprudence_ gives it this interpretation.\r\n\r\nBut I can adduce a higher and more authoritative exposition with regard\r\nto the views of at least the noble Lord the Chairman of the Commission.\r\nWhen the question was put as to legislation in conformity with the\r\nReport, Lord Stanley told this House on June 10, 1865:—\r\n\r\n    “The House ought first to have an opportunity fairly and\r\n    deliberately of deciding upon that larger question which had\r\n    not been submitted to the Patent-Law Commission—viz., whether\r\n    it was expedient that Patents for invention should continue to\r\n    be a part of the law.”\r\n\r\nWe all know there is in general society, and even among politicians\r\nand men in business, an acquiescence almost amounting to approval of\r\nPatents in the abstract. Its existence I attribute to unacquaintance\r\nwith actualities. I acknowledge that when the more able advocates of\r\nthe system state their reasons, these look conclusive enough, and would\r\nbe so if there were but one side of the case. What we, their opponents,\r\nclaim is that our objections be met. This, I apprehend, cannot be done\r\nwithout, at least, leaving so much inevitable evil confessed as must\r\nturn the scale. Some of these arguments that we hear are futile and\r\nfar-fetched enough to deserve to be repeated. Admitting obstructiveness,\r\na Chancery-lane writer pleads thus:—\r\n\r\n    “This very prohibition causes others to exert themselves to\r\n    invent different means by which the same or a better result\r\n    may be obtained than by the invention which they are prevented\r\n    from using, except by payment, and the result is competition,\r\n    in the highest degree beneficial to trade, and an unceasing\r\n    advancement and striving.”\r\n\r\nReally no better is the reasoning of an official witness, who told the\r\nCommission:—\r\n\r\n    “Three-fourths of the Patents, Inventions of\r\n    Englishmen.—Three-fourths of the applications for Patents,\r\n    or thereabouts, are for the inventions of Englishmen; the\r\n    remaining one-fourth are for the inventions of foreigners, for\r\n    the most part Frenchmen and Americans. The country in which\r\n    inventions are of the highest value will draw inventions to\r\n    it from all others, and so long as any one country protects\r\n    inventions by Patent, so long must all countries protect. Were\r\n    England to abolish protection of inventions, inventors would\r\n    carry their inventions to other countries. Switzerland does not\r\n    protect, and consequently the Swiss take their inventions to\r\n    other countries.”\r\n\r\nWhy? What harm though the British inventor should go abroad to patent or\r\neven to work his invention? He must specify it in the country he goes to;\r\nand cannot, will not, our artisans at once avail themselves, and revel in\r\nthe free use, of what he there records? Call our nation’s not rewarding\r\nhim a piece of doubtful policy, or want of generosity; but banish the\r\nnotion that our trade will suffer. It will gain.\r\n\r\nBut there are defenders of very different calibre: Mr. MacCulloch,[3]\r\nSir David Brewster, Mr. John Stuart Mill. It is meet I should inform the\r\nHouse what are their arguments. I find them succinctly stated and well\r\nput in Mr. Mill’s “Political Economy.” I will read the whole of that\r\ngentleman’s observations, interlacing, for brevity’s sake, very short and\r\nunargumentative dissents, if not replies:—\r\n\r\n    “The condemnation of monopolies ought not to extend to Patents,\r\n    by which the originator—”\r\n\r\nDoes Mr. Mill know that many an invention is patented by some person who\r\nis not the originator, but only the first promulgator in Britain; still\r\nmore often, who is not the only originator?\r\n\r\n    “of an improved process—”\r\n\r\nI have already shown that the law, rightly read, can hardly be said to\r\nsanction the patenting of a “process.”\r\n\r\n    “is allowed to enjoy, for a limited period, the exclusive\r\n    privilege of using his own improvement.”\r\n\r\nWhich means, the privilege of debarring all other people—some of whom\r\nmay, after him, or at the same time as he, or even before him, have\r\ninvented it—from doing what he is, and they also should be, allowed to do.\r\n\r\n    “This is not making the commodity dear for his benefit, but\r\n    merely postponing—”\r\n\r\nFor his benefit, and still more frequently and surely for the benefit of\r\na multitude of other individuals, who have less claim, or no claim at\r\nall.\r\n\r\n    “a part of the increased cheapness, which the public owe to the\r\n    inventor—”\r\n\r\nBut not to him only, for he invents often along with others, and always\r\nin consequence of knowledge which he derives from the common store, and\r\nwhich he ought, as its participant, to let others share, if doing so does\r\nhimself no harm.\r\n\r\n    “in order to compensate and reward him for the service.”\r\n\r\nThe real service, if it be “service,” is the communicating his knowledge.\r\n\r\n    “That he ought to be both compensated and rewarded for it, will\r\n    not be denied;”\r\n\r\nBut it does not follow, surely, even in Mr. Mill’s logic, that he should\r\nbe invested with monopoly powers, which “raise prices” and “hurt trade,”\r\nand cause “general inconvenience.”\r\n\r\n    “and also, that if all were at once allowed to avail themselves\r\n    of his ingenuity, without having shared the labours or the\r\n    expenses which he had to incur in bringing his idea into a\r\n    practical shape—”\r\n\r\nBut which, very likely, were trifling, and if heavy, were incurred for\r\nhis own sake, and may have produced benefits to himself that sufficiently\r\ncompensated all.\r\n\r\n    “either such expenses and labours would be undergone by nobody—”\r\n\r\nWhich is a wild assumption.\r\n\r\n    “except very opulent and very public-spirited persons.”\r\n\r\nThe former are numerous; the latter ought to be; and the service is one\r\nthe nation may well expect of them. Why should not there be innumerable\r\nLord Rosses, Sir Francis Crossleys, Sir David Baxters, and Sir William\r\nBrowns, promoting beneficent commerce by their generosity; and why\r\nshould not manufacturers systematically combine as an association to\r\nprocure through science and experiment every possible improvement?\r\n\r\n    “Or the State must put a value on the service rendered by an\r\n    inventor, and make him a pecuniary reward.”\r\n\r\nAnd why should we not prefer this alternative?\r\n\r\n    “This has been done in some instances, and may be done without\r\n    inconvenience in cases of very conspicuous public benefit.”\r\n\r\nWell: that is a great deal; but why not in cases that are not conspicuous?\r\n\r\n    “But in general an exclusive privilege of temporary duration is\r\n    preferable—”\r\n\r\nNow, mark the only reasons adduced:—\r\n\r\n    “because it leaves nothing to any one’s discretion—”\r\n\r\nThat is, I suppose, Mr. Mill, to avoid trusting anybody—the danger from\r\ndoing which is imaginary, or at least avoidable—would let the nation\r\nremain subject to proved frightful inconvenience and loss.\r\n\r\n    “and the greater the usefulness, the greater the reward—”\r\n\r\nWhich, Mr. Mill rightly thinks, is what ought to be, but it is not and\r\ncannot be what happens under Patents; for, on the contrary, rewards\r\ndepend mainly on the extent of use and the facility of levying royalties.\r\n\r\n    “and because it is paid by the very persons to whom the service\r\n    is rendered, the consumers of the commodity.”\r\n\r\nHere Mr. Mill appears to regard, and it is right he should, manufacturers\r\nas mere intermediates. Well: can they shift the burden which they, in the\r\nfirst instance exclusively bear, from their own shoulders to those of\r\nthe consumer? Perhaps they could have done so before the inauguration\r\nof Free Trade; but since that time, the thing is impossible, and so\r\nwill it ever be until the day arrive when either Patents shall apply to\r\nall countries, and in all countries exactly the same royalties shall be\r\ncharged for their use, or else they are abolished.\r\n\r\n    “So decisive, indeed, are these considerations, that if the\r\n    system of Patents were abandoned for that of rewards by the\r\n    State, the best shape which these could assume would be that of\r\n    a small temporary tax imposed for the inventor’s benefit—”\r\n\r\nWould he in general get it? And, let me ask, how collected—how\r\ndistributed?\r\n\r\n    “on all persons making use of the invention.”\r\n\r\nA thing impossible, however, even for conspicuous inventions; and to\r\nwhich there is the further fatal objection that there must be none but\r\nsuch recognised, which might be unfairness, as it certainly would be\r\npartiality. If, as indicated, a tax on all users and consumers, will not\r\ngrants from the Exchequer be in the main fair enough as to incidence?\r\n\r\n    “To this, however, or to any other system which would vest in\r\n    the State—”\r\n\r\nWhy the State? Why not let inventors decide?\r\n\r\n    “the power of deciding whether an inventor should derive any\r\n    pecuniary advantage for the public benefit which he confers,\r\n    the objections are evidently [!] stronger and more fundamental\r\n    than the strongest which can possibly be urged against Patents.\r\n    It is generally admitted that the present Patent-Laws need much\r\n    improvement.”\r\n\r\nIt is not admitted that they can be made satisfactory, do what we will;\r\nand I contend that no extent of mere improvement can overcome the\r\nobjectionableness of the restraints and burdens inseparable from the\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n    “But in this case, as well as in the closely analogous one of\r\n    Copyright, it would be a gross immorality in the law to set\r\n    everybody free”—\r\n\r\nWhy, everybody is naturally free, and would continue free if the law did\r\nnot step in and cruelly take their freedom away, doing which is the real\r\nimmorality.\r\n\r\n    “to use a person’s work”—\r\n\r\nA fallacy—to use, it may be, his thoughts, which, as soon as they are\r\ncommunicated, are no longer his only—and not at all to use his “work” in\r\nany proper sense.\r\n\r\n    “without his consent, and without giving him an equivalent.”\r\n\r\nAs if consent were needed to use one’s knowledge, and as if there could\r\nor should be any equivalent.\r\n\r\n    “I have seen with real alarm several recent attempts, in\r\n    quarters carrying some authority, to impugn the principle of\r\n    Patents altogether; attempts which, if practically successful,\r\n    would enthrone free stealing under the prostituted name of free\r\n    trade, and make the men of brains, still more than at present,\r\n    the needy retainers and dependents of the men of money-bags.”\r\n\r\nAs to “free stealing,” hear what the greatest political economist of\r\nFrance thinks—\r\n\r\n    “C’est dans une mesure la même question que le free trade.”\r\n\r\nAs to the “money-bags,” Mr. Mill plainly is not aware that the dependence\r\nhe deprecates is the invariable, almost the inevitable, consequence of a\r\nPatent system.\r\n\r\nI am extremely sorry to differ on a question of political economy from\r\nMr. Mill. But with all due respect I submit that he has not, when writing\r\nthe passage which has now been given _in extenso_, realised what a Patent\r\nis in practice. It is the price at which the State buys a specification.\r\nThe purchase is a compulsory one, with this peculiarity, that whereas the\r\ninventor may or may not offer to sell—for he is left at perfect liberty,\r\nas in a free country he ought to be, whether to patent and reveal (sell)\r\nor not—yet if he do offer, it is the State, the maker of the law, which,\r\nthrough the Sovereign, voluntarily puts itself under compulsion to accept\r\nthe offer, and—with a defiant violation which the frequency of the deed\r\nin my view makes flagrant of sound principle—pays not out of public\r\nrevenues or any funds over which it has legitimate control, but out of\r\nthe means of private individuals, reached and extracted either in the\r\nform of exceptional profits on goods the monopolist makes, or by his\r\nlevying of a tax called royalties on any of his fellow-subjects whom he\r\nmay of grace, if they comply with his demands, associate with himself as\r\nsharers of the monopoly.\r\n\r\nSuch opponents’ impulses are excellent, but their plan is incompatible\r\nwith actual pre-existent interests. They omit to take into full account\r\nthe conditions of the everyday world which the statesman has to do with,\r\nand might not unprofitably call to mind a story or parable of juvenile\r\ndays wherein certain wise men were represented as, after due counsel,\r\nplacing a favourite bird within high and close hedges in order to\r\ngratify their tastes and enjoy melodious notes all the year round. The\r\nconditions of winged existence had not been taken into account; theory\r\nand sentiment could not be reduced to practice. Favouritism, constraint,\r\nand isolation, being contrary to nature, failed. The nightingale loved,\r\nneeded, sought, and found freedom. To recall another book of youthful\r\ndays. Think of Robinson Crusoe, and the many new inventions his peculiar\r\nposition required and elicited. Let me suppose the neighbouring islanders\r\nsaw for the first time in his hands a cocoa-nut turned into a cup, in his\r\nhut potatoes roasting in the fire, in his garden guano used as manure.\r\nWhat would they have thought of Christianity and civilization, if he,\r\nanticipating the pretensions of modern inventors, had alleged, on the\r\nground of first use, exclusive property in these manufactures, processes,\r\nand applications, and had debarred the imitation for fourteen years? The\r\nunsophisticated savages would have said, “We understand and allow your\r\nclaims to possess what you yourself make, but we do not understand, and\r\nwe dare not allow, your claim to possess what we make ourselves. You\r\nare welcome to learn what we shall learn, and to do whatever you see us\r\ndo. We cannot sell for money the odours that rise from the fruits that\r\nsustain our life; should we forbid to pick up and plant their seeds that\r\nwe throw away? Should we grudge the runnings over from the brimming cup\r\nof knowledge which heaven puts into the hand, and the froth at the top\r\nwhich the wind blows away?” Heathens are pleased to even work at what\r\nis good for all according to opportunity. The fact is, the right of\r\ninventors is too shadowy to have any recognisable existence where there\r\nis not a submissive society to vend to or trample on, and a complaisant\r\nstate to compel their submission.\r\n\r\nIf he were a member this night present with us, I would appeal to Mr.\r\nMill as a philosopher. Seeing that the world is so framed that whereas\r\nacquisitions of material property or things cannot be possessed in common\r\nwithout the share or enjoyment of each person being lessened or lost,\r\nit is universally possible that any number of persons, however many,\r\ncan possess and use, without any diminution of individual enjoyment,\r\nknowledge or ideas in common, do not wisdom and humanity justly interpret\r\nthis as an indication that to interfere is to oppose the order of nature?\r\n\r\nLet me appeal to him as a moralist. Seeing that to so interfere with\r\nthe communication and enjoyment of knowledge or ideas by limiting the\r\npower and right to apply inventions to use is to withhold that whereby\r\none man, without loss to himself, may benefit his fellows, do not ethics\r\nfavour the philanthropic course which accords with the course that Nature\r\nindicates?\r\n\r\nI appeal to Mr. Mill as a political economist. Seeing that the order\r\nof nature and the promptings of philanthropy are favourable to the\r\ncommunication of inventions and their free use, is it the part of a State\r\nto provide for the gratification of the selfish principle in man by\r\nlegislation framed to endorse, and facilitate, and almost to necessitate\r\nit?\r\n\r\nI appeal to Mr. Mill as a statesman, and ask, Is it consistent with\r\nenlightened policy to place manufacturers in such a position, that they\r\nare constantly tempted to conceal improvements they are using, from\r\nfear to discover that they are infringing? Does he know so little of\r\nmankind, that he expects them, the poorest as well as the richest, to\r\nemploy (and this would be requisite) suitable agents to search whether\r\nany improvement they mean to adopt is already the subject of a Patent\r\nthat renders its adoption illegal, and also to institute inquiries as\r\nto who, and where, in the wide world, is the holder of the Patent or\r\nPatents, whom in that case he must first negotiate with and sue for\r\na licence? Does Mr. Mill think a manufacturer’s time is so free from\r\nabsorbing occupations that he can attend to the daily transactions of\r\nthe Patent-office, so as to inquire whether such and such a mysterious\r\napplication is an unintended, it may be, but in result an effectual,\r\nousting him from use of a process that he is about to introduce or has\r\nalready in operation? Yet these are the superhuman efforts and gifts\r\nwhich compliance with, and subjection to, any Patent system presupposes\r\nand requires.\r\n\r\nIs it nothing in the eyes of this legislator, whose absence from this\r\nHouse is so generally regretted, that by means of the Patent-Laws there\r\nare thrown loose on men in trade thousands of individuals whose interests\r\nrun counter to those of society, men trusted with letters of marque to\r\nprey, not on foreign commerce, but on British? Is it a small matter,\r\nthat, having surrendered the principle of discriminating duties leviable\r\nby the State for national purposes, we continue to expose those from\r\nwhom this protection is withdrawn to an ever-increasing burden of taxes,\r\nin favour of individuals, levied without State control or any regard to\r\nequality? Does Mr. Mill conceive it is short of recklessness to continue\r\nto stimulate invention by rewards which often turn out ruinous to those\r\nwhom they are meant to favour, and which bear not the smallest proportion\r\nto the cleverness, the beneficial results, the cost of elaborating, the\r\nmerits or the wants of the inventor, and scarcely to the originality and\r\nlegitimacy of the claim of whoever is the applicant? Is he aware that\r\nthe advantage reaped by inventors, sometimes very large, is obtained at\r\nso frightful a cost that, as some persons believe, for every pound which\r\nactually reaches him the country loses to the extent of one hundred\r\npounds? Surely we are asked to obtain our stimulus by a folly (only his\r\nwas voluntary, and not habitual) like that of the fabulous sailor who,\r\nfor the sake of a tumbler of rum, swallowed the bucketful of salt water\r\namid which the dangerous stimulant had by accident fallen. I honour the\r\ncandour of Mr. Mill, and I hope yet to have his concurrence in my views.\r\nHe cannot have reflected on and realised actual facts. One illustration\r\nmore, and this of another difficulty which I commend to his attention and\r\nthat of any honourable gentlemen who have been carried away along with\r\nhim, I give by narrating an incident in my late canvass.\r\n\r\nA deputation of the trades of Scotland did the candidates the honour\r\nof submitting to us a very judicious list of questions. One of these\r\nconcerned the Patent-Law. They asked, would I support a motion for\r\nreducing the cost of Patents? I answered I would, because I think the\r\ncost too high for the working man; but I added that I would rather see\r\nPatents swept away. One of the deputation properly animadverted on the\r\nhardship this might inflict, and he instanced the case of his brother,\r\nwho had invented an improved apparatus for use on board ship. I rejoined\r\nthat I accepted the case as sufficient to confirm the conviction that\r\nPatents are on the whole not good, but bad, for working men or any men.\r\nMy reasoning was substantially this: In order to reap his reward, the\r\ninventor is required or expected to visit every ship or shipowner at the\r\nport, and endeavour to get the apparatus understood, believed in, and\r\nadopted; and not at Leith only—at every Scotch port, every English port,\r\nand every Irish port. But not to let British shipowners suffer by the\r\ninequality of paying, while rivals use without paying, and at the same\r\ntime to promote his own interests, the inventor must take out Patents in\r\nFrance, Belgium, Holland, and all maritime countries and their colonies.\r\nAfter he obtains these many Patents he has to sell his apparatus at\r\nall the ports of those countries. The first thing obvious is, that to\r\ndo a tithe of that work the inventor must relinquish his own business,\r\nwhich is the solid beef in the mouth of the dog in the fable, for the\r\ndelusive shadow in the water. But never mind that in the meantime: after\r\nthe business is relinquished, there remains the insuperable difficulty\r\nof conducting a business so much beyond the power of man as that I have\r\nsketched. He might of course attempt to overcome that by appointing\r\nagents to manufacture abroad or act abroad for him; but where is the\r\ncapital to hazard on so great an enterprise? If he were as rich as a\r\nRothschild, has he the gift of tongues to enable him to correspond in all\r\nlanguages? And if he had, how can all this work, requiring simultaneity,\r\nbe done at once? The end, of course, must be, at the very best—the\r\nPatents, if, indeed, actually taken, are sold for a trifle, and the\r\npersons who secure them, which they only do if valuable, in their turn\r\nsell, for a trifle too; so that the lucky inventor gets but little out of\r\nthe tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of pounds which the public\r\nare made to bear the burden of. _Ex uno disce omnes._\r\n\r\nI am unwilling to leave this part of my theme without adverting to a\r\npoint which deserves some attention—I mean the tendency the Patent\r\nsystem has to lower the tone of men of science. In a quotation from Lord\r\nGranville it is seen to be more than insinuated that the sacred claims of\r\ntruth are in danger of being compromised by the evidence men of science\r\nare asked and tempted to give in courts of law. But the evil of Patents\r\nbegins in the laboratory and the closet; for there is felt the impulse\r\nto conceal anything new and likely to be useful, in order to patent; so\r\nthat a conflict is generated between, on the one hand, the theory of the\r\nacademic chair which supposes in the very name “university” universalism,\r\ncommunity of knowledge, and on the other, law-created personal interests,\r\nwhose nature it is to stifle the man of science’s inherent desire to\r\nspread knowledge and exchange thoughts in order to benefit mankind.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Mill presents an alternative. I, for one, have no objection to\r\nsee it considered. I have long advocated State rewards; they cannot be\r\ncondemned on principle; they are sanctioned by another philosopher. When\r\nI say that I had the honour long ago to receive the following from M.\r\nChevalier, I am sure of this House’s attention.\r\n\r\n     _Extract of a Letter from M. Michel Chevalier to Mr. Macfie._\r\n\r\n    “The Patent system, as constituted in all countries where\r\n    it is established, is a monopoly that outrages liberty and\r\n    industry. It has consequences that are disastrous, seeing\r\n    there are cases where it may stop trade for exportation and\r\n    even for home consumption, because it places manufacturers who\r\n    work in a country where Patents are established at a great\r\n    disadvantage in competing with others who live in States,\r\n    such as Switzerland, where Patents are interdicted by law.\r\n    Practice, experience, which is the supreme authority in the\r\n    world, shows daily, in France particularly, that the system is\r\n    a scourge to industry. What might be substituted is a system of\r\n    recompenses, either national or European, as you have proposed,\r\n    to be awarded when practical use has pronounced on the merit\r\n    of each invention, and when the originality shall admit of\r\n    being established. All the friends of industrial and social\r\n    progress ought to unite their efforts to liberate industry from\r\n    the shackles that have been bequeathed from the past. That of\r\n    Patents is one of those which there will be most urgency to get\r\n    rid of.”\r\n\r\nThe Continental Association for Promoting the Progress of Social Sciences\r\nfavours such rewards. Allow me to quote from a Report of M. Tilliere,\r\nAvocât of Brussels, which was adopted by that body:—\r\n\r\n    “It is proper to introduce, in respect to industrial\r\n    inventions, the principle of _expropriation_ [or acquisition\r\n    for behoof of the public], with a view to general benefit,\r\n    in order to reconcile the interests of industry and the\r\n    requirements of free trade (_libre échange_) with the interests\r\n    of the inventor.\r\n\r\n    “It is desirable, for the satisfaction of the same interests,\r\n    to establish between the different countries by means of\r\n    stipulations with reference to Patents in International\r\n    Treaties, uniformity of system, and, pursuant thereto, to\r\n    provide a depôt where, without the necessity to patent in every\r\n    particular country, specifications might be lodged that shall\r\n    be recognised and published in all.”\r\n\r\nThe House will observe that in connexion with the principle of\r\nState rewards, or, what is nearly allied to it, of expropriation,\r\nthe Association commended another principle, that of international\r\narrangements as to inventions. On the occasion when the report I quote\r\nfrom was adopted, another eminent French economist, Professor Wolowski,\r\nspoke as follows:—\r\n\r\n    “The free competition which ought to exist between peoples\r\n    requires that Patents should be everywhere ruled by uniform\r\n    laws. Intellectual property must everywhere have limits within\r\n    which there shall be exchange, in order that its products may\r\n    everywhere circulate under the same conditions. International\r\n    legislation with regard to Patents is an object to be\r\n    earnestly pursued. It responds to the demands of free-trade,\r\n    satisfies the needs of liberty of manufacture, and provides a\r\n    compensation for a shortened term of Patent-right by extension\r\n    of area.”\r\n\r\nBut I come nearer home, and am happy to be able to quote concurrence\r\nin the idea of national rewards on the part of one of our great staple\r\nmanufacturers, the sugar refiners. The refiners of Scotland many years\r\nago petitioned Parliament in the following terms:—\r\n\r\n    “That, in the opinion of the petitioners, it is highly\r\n    desirable that your honourable House should devise some means\r\n    whereby discoverers of valuable inventions (to whom alone\r\n    Patents should be granted) might be rewarded by the State, and\r\n    trade be relieved from the restrictive operation and expense of\r\n    Patents altogether.”\r\n\r\nTending in favour of rewards rather than Patents is the following\r\nevidence, given before the Royal Commission by Sir William Armstrong:—\r\n\r\n    “How would you give these rewards in the absence of a\r\n    Patent-Law?—I am not prepared to say that. If the country would\r\n    expend in direct rewards a tithe of what is paid for Patent\r\n    licences and expenses, there would be ample provision for the\r\n    purpose. As a matter of opinion, I believe that if you let\r\n    the whole thing alone, the position which a man attains, the\r\n    introduction and the _prestige_, and the natural advantages\r\n    which result from a successful invention and from the\r\n    reputation which he gains as a clever and able man, will almost\r\n    always bring with them a sufficient reward.”\r\n\r\nA successful inventor writes me:—\r\n\r\n    “I should be very glad to see a good round sum set apart by\r\n    Government for the purpose of being awarded to real inventors\r\n    by competent and impartial authority. Then the poor inventor\r\n    might have some chance.”\r\n\r\nIt is not out of place to inform the House that so far back as the\r\nearliest years of the Patent system a precedent can be adduced. In 1625,\r\nSir F. Crane received a grant of £2,000 a-year for introducing a tapestry\r\nmanufacture. There are several other precedents for similar grants of\r\npublic money.\r\n\r\nOf course, to reward is not to purchase. We do not buy any man’s\r\ninvention or secret. But if he thinks proper, as a good subject, to\r\nreveal that secret, we mean he shall have a substantial mark of favour.\r\nSomething like this was, no doubt, the original intention of Patents;\r\nonly the favour took the form of monopoly for introducing and working a\r\nmanufacture, whereas we prefer to pay, as soon as the value and benefits\r\nof the invention made can be guessed at, such a sum of money as will\r\nbe neither, on the one hand, from its magnitude made oppressive to the\r\npeople, nor, on the other, from insignificance or paltry conditions\r\nunworthy of a noble mind, whatever the rank, to accept. What is given\r\nwill be proportioned to merit or service, and will be, in the fullest\r\nsense, a _honorarium_, a complimentary gift, a mark of national\r\napprobation and gratitude. We all know, though few of us think of it\r\nas a striking proof how Patents have declined in public esteem, that\r\namong us to be a patentee is by no means usually reckoned an honourable\r\ndistinction. It is the same in France.\r\n\r\n    “The title of patentee is falling into greater disrepute every\r\n    day from the abuse which is made of it.”\r\n\r\nThis prejudice we must remove, and we can do it. I believe in the\r\npossibility and advisableness of presenting, as a substitute for Patents,\r\na system of rewards which will reconcile the honour and interests of men\r\nof science and those of practical men, the interests of the master and\r\nthose of his workmen, the interests of the many and those of the few.\r\nSuch a system, while entirely emancipating commerce and industry, must,\r\nas its condition, deal out its rewards more equitably than the Patent\r\nsystem does, and with more regard to the just claims of inventors. It\r\nmust distribute these without the tedious delays now suffered from. Its\r\nrewards must, in contradistinction to present experience be sure, easily\r\nattainable, and suitable for poor as well as rich. I respectfully submit\r\nthe following scheme as one that at least may form a basis for some\r\nsystem that will obtain general acceptance.\r\n\r\n\r\n_New System of Rewarding Inventors and Promoting the Publication of\r\nInventions._\r\n\r\n1. The Patent-office to be turned into an office for recording inventions.\r\n\r\n2. (Forms for specifications to be furnished gratuitously.)\r\n\r\nAll specifications to contain a certificate that the inventions promise\r\nto be useful, and are believed to be new, from three persons familiar\r\nwith the trade chiefly concerned; one of whom, if the inventor is an\r\n_employé_, to be his employer.\r\n\r\n3. These specifications to be registered.\r\n\r\n4. Any time after an invention has been tried and proved practically\r\nuseful, a fact to be duly certified, the inventor to be allowed to claim\r\nthat the invention shall be reported on.\r\n\r\n5. A Chief Commissioner for Inventions shall appoint one or more\r\nexaminers for this purpose, whose duty it shall be (after, if needful,\r\nfirst visiting the scene of operations, and conferring with practical\r\nmanufacturers) to recommend, if they think it worthy, classification for\r\na reward, prize, or certificate of merit.\r\n\r\n6. Once a year the head of the Invention-office, with the help of\r\nan Adjudicatory Committee, who shall form an Invention Commission,\r\nshall classify the several inventions that have been in the previous\r\ntwelve months certified as having been for the first time brought into\r\nbeneficial use.\r\n\r\n7. In his classification the first rank shall entitle to a\r\n\r\n    reward of  £10,000.\r\n    2nd          5,000.\r\n    3rd          1,000.\r\n    4th            500.\r\n    5th            100.\r\n    6th             50.\r\n    7th, Gold Medal, or value in money.\r\n    8th, Silver Medal  ”\r\n    9th, Bronze Medal  ”\r\n    10th, Certificate of Merit.\r\n\r\n8. Parliament shall annually place at the disposal of the Invention\r\nCommission £200,000, from which shall be defrayed the expenses of the\r\nstaff, and fees to “reporters,” as well as of the several publications\r\nshowing the progress of Invention that shall (as now, but on an improved\r\nsystem) be issued; the balance to be distributed in rewards and prizes,\r\nwith an understanding, however, that the amount must be reduced if the\r\ntotal awards of the Commission shall exceed the money at its disposal.\r\n\r\n9. In appointing Commissioners Government shall consult the various\r\ntrading interests of the nation in order to select the most acceptable\r\npersons. Inventors collectively might have a veto or the initiative.\r\n\r\n10. The prizes may be divided between the originator of the idea of any\r\ninvention and the successful introducer into practical use.\r\n\r\n11. Where there are rival claimants, the expense of deciding priority in\r\nrespect of time and merit to be borne by themselves.\r\n\r\n12. The Commission to be at liberty to correspond with foreign nations,\r\nand act in concert with any that shall establish instead of Patents a\r\nsystem of rewards.\r\n\r\n13. In cases in which pre-eminent merit, especially if there has been a\r\ncourse of costly experiments antecedent, appears to entitle to a reward\r\ngreater than the largest in the schedule, Government may propose to\r\nParliament special augmentations. I do not presume to recommend Royal\r\ndecorations and titles, though such honours would be much valued.\r\n\r\nA writer on Patents has judiciously said—\r\n\r\n    “It would seem very desirable that a system of registration for\r\n    all improvements or ideas which an inventor may think of minor\r\n    importance should be instituted, whereby any one could, at a\r\n    moderate cost to defray expenses, deposit at the Patent-office,\r\n    a description of any new idea, improvement, or invention.”\r\n\r\nMy scheme is calculated to answer this good end.\r\n\r\nHere I may fitly call attention to an interesting and instructive\r\nanalysis which Mr. Woodcroft submitted to the Commission. He showed—\r\n\r\n    RESULTS of the EXAMINATION of the first hundred inventions, for\r\n    which applications for Patents were made in each of the years\r\n    1855, 1858, and 1862 (abridged).\r\n\r\n    1855.\r\n\r\n    “Of the first hundred inventions for which applications for\r\n    Patents were made in the year 1855, none are apparently of\r\n    considerable value.\r\n\r\n    “Four of the hundred inventions appear to be of some, but not\r\n    of great value, and Patents were granted for all of them.\r\n\r\n    “The remaining ninety-six of the hundred inventions seem to be\r\n    of little or no value; and Patents were granted for sixty-six\r\n    of them.”\r\n\r\n    1858.\r\n\r\n    “Of the first hundred inventions for which applications for\r\n    Patents were made in the year 1858, none are apparently of\r\n    considerable value.\r\n\r\n    “Three of the hundred inventions appear to be of some, but not\r\n    of much value.\r\n\r\n    “The remaining ninety-seven of the hundred inventions seem\r\n    to be of little or no value; and Patents were granted for\r\n    sixty-two of them.”\r\n\r\n    1862.\r\n\r\n    “Of the first hundred inventions for which applications for\r\n    Patents were made in the year 1862, one is apparently of\r\n    considerable value.\r\n\r\n    “Of the same hundred inventions one appeared to be of some, but\r\n    not of great value.\r\n\r\n    “The remaining ninety-eight of the hundred inventions seem to\r\n    be of little or no value. Patents were granted for fifty-nine\r\n    of them.”\r\n\r\nI conceive, on the basis of this evidence, that the estimate I am now\r\nabout to give represents, relatively, but I will not venture to say\r\nabsolutely, a fair view of probable claims. It also affords some guide\r\nfor anticipating what, coming from the Exchequer, would be a reasonable\r\ntotal vote for rewards. Such a sum, or even a larger, Parliament should\r\nwillingly grant. It can be proved to be true national economy. The\r\nnation, as individuals, is paying vastly more now. For that burden\r\nParliament, by not removing Patents, is alone responsible.\r\n\r\n      1 at                        £10,000\r\n      3 at 5,000                   15,000\r\n     12 at 1,000                   12,000\r\n     84 at 500                     42,000\r\n    250 at 100                     25,000\r\n    400 at 50                      20,000\r\n        Medals and Certificates\r\n          of Honour and Merit       1,000\r\n    ---                          --------\r\n    750                          £125,000\r\n\r\nI am aware that inventors have hitherto drawn such large sums in some\r\ncases (in many or most cases claiming more than they got), that they may\r\nat first hardly be pleased with my proposal. But they should remember\r\nthat the sums set down are those derivable from one country alone—one of\r\nthe between forty or fifty countries which give Patents now. The revenues\r\nfrom these other countries, therefore, are to be added. They will also\r\nconsider that it is optional whether or not they apply for rewards. Let\r\nthem work in secret, if they will and can. But if they resolutely contend\r\nfor Patents, let them know the time for abolishing these is at hand; and\r\nabolition may come, if they resist it, without even this substitute.\r\n\r\nI have endeavoured to show what I believe to be true—that Parliament,\r\nwhen it, by the Act 21, Jas., 3, tolerated monopolies for inventions,\r\ndid not sanction any system at all like that into which Patents have\r\ndeveloped, or degenerated; that, in defiance of the Act, Patents are\r\ngranted so as to create the evils which Parliament expressly sought to\r\nshield the nation from; that recent legislation has aggravated the great\r\nevils that pre-existed; that a Commission has satisfied itself that no\r\nradical or sufficient remedy can be applied; that the arguments of the\r\ndefenders of Patent monopolies are untenable; that the most eminent\r\nstatesmen, lawyers, engineers, manufacturers, and philosophers plead for\r\nabolition; that the State is at liberty, and has the power, to devise,\r\nif it wills, a better method of dealing with inventions, but that such a\r\nmethod must be one that leaves manufacturers free, and able to compete\r\nwith continental rivals by at once adopting, without any burden of\r\nroyalties, every most recent improvement.\r\n\r\nTo conclude: this great and vital question cannot longer be deferred. It\r\nmust be taken up, and that early, by what is expected to be a working\r\nParliament—a Parliament, too, which for the first time can claim to\r\nrepresent labour and operative industry. Parliament has legislated\r\nin order to the preservation of salmon, and required the removal of\r\nobstacles on the coasts and in the rivers. Here are far worse obstacles,\r\naffecting not a luxury, but all our necessaries of existence, and every\r\nmeans of earning a livelihood.\r\n\r\nAgain: are we not asked to remove light-dues at the sea and tolls on\r\nthe land? But what are these unimportant, sparse, and withal equitable\r\ntaxes, compared with the close-recurring stoppage and the indefinite\r\nand heavy demands for questionable “service” which Patents constitute?\r\nYet, again: By arrangement with France we recently abolished the\r\ntime-sanctioned petty exemptions of free-men; but here we are continuing\r\nto levy more burdensome private taxes, with exemptions in favour of\r\nforeigners! It is they, indeed, whom the provisions of the Patent-Law\r\nstrangely serve. Foreign countries are not so liberal to British subjects\r\nas we are to theirs;—why should they? The number of Patents we grant in a\r\nyear to foreigners has increased within a short period tenfold—to about\r\n880, or about twelve times the whole number that Prussia grants to her\r\nown subjects and all the world besides. Well may Sir William Armstrong\r\nremark in his evidence:—\r\n\r\n    “Unless you wish to benefit the foreigner, unless that be the\r\n    sole object, as a matter of policy, I do not see what the\r\n    motive to apply the Patent system is.”\r\n\r\nThe same witness said also:—\r\n\r\n    “Is it the fact that Patents are taken out in this country\r\n    for processes which are in operation abroad, but which have\r\n    not been previously introduced into this country?—Certainly.\r\n    A process in actual operation abroad, which has not been\r\n    published in this country, can be made the subject of a Patent.\r\n\r\n    “Is it practically the case that processes which are carried on\r\n    abroad are brought into this country by parties who patent them\r\n    here?—Yes.\r\n\r\n    “A great number every week?—Yes, constantly.”\r\n\r\nAny one who has followed me in the statements I have presented will\r\nsee that, while we have been retrograding and making our system of\r\nmonopoly wider and worse, the Continent, to which a Patent system was\r\nfirst introduced just three-quarters of a century ago, is ahead of us in\r\nrespect of the prudence with which exclusive privileges are granted and\r\nadministered. There, as a rule tolerably general, Patents of importation\r\nare treated less liberally than those granted to inventors. The early\r\nand almost continuous working of the Patent within the kingdom is\r\nrequired; it lapses when expiry abroad exposes to foreign competition;\r\nexpropriation is provided for; there is more scrutiny; medical appliances\r\nand food are excluded, &c.\r\n\r\nBut this is merely one, and a comparatively unimportant, fault of the\r\nsystem. There are many faults, as we have seen, much more serious, and\r\nwhich the Commission deem irremovable. I must, therefore, protest against\r\ninjury done by the Patent system to our manufacturers and artisans, and\r\nthrough them to the nation.\r\n\r\nThese interests, the interests of us all, cannot with impunity be\r\nsubjected longer to the hardships that I have endeavoured to expose.\r\nTimes are changed. British and Irish manufacturing pre-eminence\r\nis passing away, not indeed by its actual retrogression, but by a\r\nsimultaneous and relatively more rapid progression of rivals on the\r\nContinent, who, in not a few cases, are competing successfully, even in\r\nour home markets, in those articles of commerce and manufacture in which\r\nbut lately we, perhaps conceitedly, supposed we had outstripped, without\r\na chance of being overtaken, all conceivable rivals. The motion, of\r\nwhich notice has been given, is:—\r\n\r\n    “That, in the opinion of this House, the time has arrived when\r\n    the interests of trade and commerce, and the progress of the\r\n    arts and sciences, in this country would be promoted by the\r\n    abolition of Patents for inventions.”\r\n\r\nUnless, indeed, Government and the House prefer in the first instance\r\nfresh inquiries through a Committee or Royal Commission, in behalf\r\nof which course it is fair to allege the circumstance that artisans\r\nand operatives were not represented among the witnesses in former\r\ninvestigations, I submit that this motion ought to be at once adopted.\r\nSuch action on our part will commend, and, in a sense, inaugurate,\r\na principle which the nations of the world, who copied our present\r\nsystem, will not be slow to appreciate and embrace. Restoration of that\r\neffete system to its earlier moderate dimensions—rectification, however\r\nthorough, of the wrongs it involves towards inventors, will not suffice,\r\nand need not be attempted. The time has come, not for palliatives nor\r\nremedies, but for removal out of the way.\r\n\r\n[2] Another illustration naively presented us, even by Mr. Hindmarch,\r\nof the characteristic logic and boldness of the Patent interest, which\r\nmay surprise “inventors’ friends” accustomed to rely that our system of\r\nPatents is legal and constitutional, will be found in the Appendix.\r\n\r\n[3] What would Adam Smith think of his commentator?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH OF SIR R. PALMER, K.B., M.P.\r\n\r\n\r\nSir ROUNDELL PALMER, in seconding the motion, said he had long felt\r\nconvinced that this subject was one of great and growing importance,\r\nwhich it would be necessary at an early period to bring before the\r\nattention of the House. He rejoiced that it had been undertaken by a\r\npractical man like the honourable member for Leith, who could speak\r\nupon it, not under the influence of any of the partial views which\r\npossibly those who looked at it from a lawyer’s point of view might be\r\nthought by some to entertain, whether they were in favour of or against\r\nPatents. He was glad to find that practical men like his honourable\r\nfriend had arrived at conclusions which, in their broad principles,\r\nwere substantially the same as those to which many members of the legal\r\nprofession, who had had a good deal of opportunity of observing that\r\nmatter, had in common with himself, come. He was bound to state that\r\nhe thought the time had arrived rather for opening than for concluding\r\nthe discussion of that subject; and, therefore, he hoped he should not\r\nbe thought to do anything inconsistent with the duty he had undertaken\r\nin seconding his honourable friend’s motion, when he said at once that,\r\nfor his own part, he was inclined to go to the root of the matter and\r\nabolish Patents altogether, and not attempt to substitute even such a\r\nsystem—although it might probably be preferable in many respects to the\r\npresent system—of rewards, as his honourable friend had mentioned. Of\r\ncourse those who derived benefit—whether they were the public or were\r\nprivate individuals—from the discoveries that might be made if Patents\r\nceased to exist, might always take into consideration the value they\r\nreceived, and pay for that benefit, as he believed the Government now\r\ndid, although it was not bound by Patents, with respect to improvements\r\nwhich were useful to the public service. But that, he conceived,\r\nwould be a very different thing from an organised system of rewards\r\nat all analogous to the present system of Patents. He might mention,\r\nin passing, a third plan, which had found very able and authoritative\r\nadvocates, and which he should also greatly prefer to the present system,\r\nalthough he thought total abolition would be better than that likewise.\r\nHe referred to the plan of putting an end to the notion that every\r\nperson who invented anything had a right to a Patent, and recurring to\r\nwhat, he imagined, was originally the principle intended—namely, the\r\ngiving of Patents as a matter of grace and favour in well-selected and\r\ndiscriminated cases, in the exercise of a discretion by an authority\r\nentrusted with that discretion. But, as he had already said, he confessed\r\nthat he himself was not for half measures in that matter. He thought\r\nthey had a right, as the motion proposed, to say that at the period of\r\nprogress in the history of the arts and of trade in this country at\r\nwhich they had arrived, they could do much better without these props.\r\nHe called them props because he thought they were meant to be so, but\r\nhe believed that at present they were nothing but obstructions and\r\nhindrances to trade and the arts. Let him, in the first place, notice\r\nthe principle on which the Patent-Law was generally supported. Some\r\npersons imagined that there was a sort of either moral or natural right\r\nin inventors to some such protection as was given by Patents, and the\r\nprinciple was sometimes expressed in this way—that a man had a right\r\nto the fruit of his brain. Now, he held that invention and discovery\r\nwere essentially unlike Copyright. Copyright applied to a creation: a\r\nman wrote a book; he thus brought into existence something which had no\r\nexistence in the nature of things before. The rest of the world were\r\nnot in the race with him to write that particular book. But in the case\r\nof inventions and discoveries, the facts with which they were concerned\r\nlay in Nature itself, and all mankind who were engaged in pursuits\r\nwhich gave them an interest in the investigation for practical purposes\r\nof the laws of Nature, had an equal right of access to the knowledge\r\nof those laws and might be equally in the track for obtaining it. All\r\nwho were engaged in particular arts and manufactures were actually\r\nupon the track which led to the discovery of the useful application of\r\nthose laws; and the knowledge of them was the common stock and property\r\nof all mankind who were equally in pursuit of it. He could not allow\r\nthat the man who was first in the race of discovery could claim for\r\nfourteen years, or any other term, an exclusive property in a portion\r\nof the common stock of knowledge which was accessible to all who used\r\nthe proper means of discovering it. It could not be said that on any\r\nconsiderations except those of public advantage and expediency the man\r\nwho made the first discovery of a law of nature, or the right mode of\r\napplying it had an exclusive right to apply that discovery for a certain\r\nperiod. It was said, however, that Patents were useful to the public,\r\neither as stimulating invention, or as insuring the publication of useful\r\ndiscoveries; and he did not venture to say that the time might not have\r\nbeen when they answered both of those purposes. Bounties and premiums\r\nmight be adapted to a rude state of the arts, and an early stage in the\r\nprogress of commerce, but when a nation had reached so high a degree of\r\nprogress in all ingenious arts and discoveries and in trade and commerce\r\nas we had, he thought that in this department, as well as in others, the\r\nsystem of bounties and premiums was much more likely to be mischievous\r\nthan useful. But of course one could not demonstrate that point by\r\nresting merely on an abstract proposition, and therefore he would ask the\r\nHouse to look at two or three things which it seemed to him would put the\r\nmatter in a strong practical light. Patents might be divided into those\r\nwhich might be popularly called meritorious, and those which were not\r\nmeritorious. The former class were certainly not one in a hundred of the\r\ntotal number of Patents, and the latter class were very numerous in every\r\nyear. How, then, did the system work as regarded meritorious Patents? He\r\nsupposed it would be admitted that among the most meritorious discoveries\r\nof recent times were the steam engine, the electric telegraph, and the\r\nscrew propeller for ships. These cases furnished excellent illustrations\r\nof the way in which the Patent system worked. Take the electric\r\ntelegraph. According to the evidence on the subject it was not possible,\r\neven for those who best understood the matter, to say who was entitled\r\nto the merit of that invention, so gradual and imperceptible was the\r\nnatural growth and progress of knowledge and discovery in reference to\r\nit. But about 400 or 500 Patents had been taken out as marking different\r\nsteps in the investigation of that subject. As to the screw propeller, he\r\nhad seen a book which represented the collected Patents of one company\r\nas being 90 or 100; and he understood that the case was very much the\r\nsame in regard to the steam engine. They were not dealing, in the case\r\nof the most meritorious inventions, with a true discovery by a single\r\ninventor, but with an important branch of practical knowledge at which\r\nmany men were working at the same time, and in regard to which each step\r\nattained indicated the next step that was to follow, and many persons\r\ntogether were on the road. Well, but if they were on the road, the public\r\nwould get the benefit of the discovery, and the question was whether, by\r\nenabling each person on the road to stop up the road at his particular\r\npoint, they were not really retarding the progress of discovery, and\r\nthrowing difficulties in the way of even the most valuable inventions.\r\nThere was no one better acquainted with that subject than a friend of\r\nhis—a gentleman very eminent both in science and in law. He meant Mr.\r\nGrove; and those members of the legal profession who had to encounter Mr.\r\nGrove in a Patent case knew they had a very difficult task indeed before\r\nthem. Now, here were the words of Mr. Grove in reference to that subject:—\r\n\r\n    “Always when a discovery has been made when the public has\r\n    reaped the fruits of it, there is no case, and never was a\r\n    case, either in the history of pure science or in the history\r\n    of practical discovery, where it is not alleged, ‘If you look\r\n    at such a book and such another book, you will find that so\r\n    and so has been done, and you will find that it has been\r\n    anticipated.’ That is partly true and partly false. There are\r\n    in all such cases approximate anticipations. The difference\r\n    is, that one man gets at the points, hits the real thing which\r\n    will do it, and the reason why it will; whereas other people,\r\n    although they may have got the thing, have not acquired an\r\n    accurate knowledge which will enable them with certainty to\r\n    produce it.”\r\n\r\nThat showed the House that the race was often so close that even the\r\nman who had hit the thing might be shut out by somebody else who did\r\nit a trifle better. Nothing could be more true than that. Would the\r\nHouse allow him to quote the example of a very important Patent, which\r\nhe thought would make the matter clear, and indicate how much they\r\nmight lose by a system of that description. For a very long time the\r\ndistillation of oils from shale and coal had been a matter of the\r\ncommon knowledge—aye, and of the common practice, of mankind. Early in\r\nthe present, or towards the end of the last century, it was practised\r\nby means precisely similar in all points to those which the present\r\npatentees used in this country. But it was not known commercially that\r\nthere was such a thing as paraffin, nor was it known commercially how\r\nto distil it. The oil was, indeed, obtained in a rough way, and without\r\nthat nicety of discrimination which afterwards resulted from scientific\r\nknowledge of the article itself. All chemists knew that in order to\r\ndistil these oils it was necessary to keep the temperature as low as\r\npossible. This was the state of knowledge when a great German chemist\r\ndiscovered that by operating on wood, tar, and other substances, he could\r\nproduce paraffin in small quantities. He also said it could be got from\r\ncoals in precisely the same way as was subsequently done by patentees\r\nin this country. But still the German chemist’s experiments were of a\r\nscientific and not of a commercial character. He neither produced it\r\ncommercially nor did he hit upon the material from which it could be\r\ncommercially produced. The same oil could be produced from shale. Only\r\nthe other day there was discovered in Scotland a new kind of mineral, as\r\nto which the scientific world were at variance whether it was coal or\r\nshale. Patents had been already taken out for distilling oil from shale,\r\nand, therefore, if the newly-discovered substance were shale, oil could\r\nnot be obtained from it without an infringement of those Patents. But a\r\nPatent was taken out by a gentleman who stated that his object was to\r\nuse bituminous coals for the purpose of distilling paraffin. In point\r\nof fact, he hit upon a mineral which was _in ambiguo_, whether it was\r\ncoal or shale, but which the authorities ultimately pronounced to be\r\ncoal. From this substance the oil could be produced in large quantities.\r\nThis gentleman took out his Patent, notwithstanding all the previous\r\nknowledge on the subject, and notwithstanding the fact to which the\r\nlearned judge who decided the case in one of its branches referred in the\r\nfollowing terms:—\r\n\r\n    “There is ample evidence that the attention of practical\r\n    chemists was previously to the date of Young’s Patent\r\n    laboriously directed to discover the proper material and the\r\n    proper means of producing these articles in sufficiently large\r\n    quantities for common purposes.”\r\n\r\nThe public literally had in their hands all the necessary elements of\r\nknowledge belonging to the subject, and yet the first person who found\r\nthat this particular coal was more bituminous than others excluded the\r\nrest of the world from that manufacture for fourteen years, and of course\r\namassed a large fortune. Substantially, the test in the courts of law\r\nwas whether a man had made money and brought the manufacture into use.\r\nIf so, the courts assumed that all previous knowledge was inadequate and\r\nuseless, and the man who was successful in the manufacture was regarded\r\nas the discoverer. Was it not quite clear, however, that the public\r\nwere so far on the road to this discovery that it would have assuredly\r\nbeen found out and enjoyed by the public at large if the path had not\r\nbeen obstructed by the Patent? He would now mention another case. In\r\nthe days of our youth mills were much infested with flour flying about\r\nin them. All the millers, both in this country and abroad, wanted to\r\nget rid of this nuisance, and they were possessed of the scientific\r\nprinciple and the mechanical means by which this desirable object would\r\nbe accomplished. They tried experiments with fans which created a draught\r\nto draw the air from the millstones, and everything depended on the\r\nadjustment of a plan to draw just sufficient air and no more. People\r\nwere actually on the road, and were doing the thing in an imperfect way,\r\nbut in such a way that if they had continued after the granting of the\r\nPatent it would have made them infringers of it. But the man who proposed\r\nto do just enough, and no more, was held to be entitled to a Patent,\r\nwhereupon all the millers in England combined to go into litigation in\r\norder to defend themselves. Law-suits of the most enormous and oppressive\r\nmagnitude resulted simply from the circumstance that a man had been\r\nallowed to step in and prevent the millers from carrying on their\r\nbusiness in the best way. That they would have found it out was certain.\r\nThat was certainly the impression on his mind. He thought it was almost\r\ncertain that the discovery being in the direction of their necessity,\r\nand depending on the application of a known principle and of known\r\nmechanical means, was a discovery which could not in the course of nature\r\nhave been long delayed. Having said thus much about those Patents which\r\nwere meritorious, he would make a few remarks on those which were not. A\r\ngreat number of Patents were simply frivolous, and related to practical\r\nnothings, but still nothings affecting trades, and standing like lions\r\nin the path to frighten tradespeople, and to expose them to risk,\r\nlitigation, and annoyance, if they manufactured those articles which they\r\nought to be at liberty to manufacture. Then there were other Patents of a\r\nless frivolous nature. They related to some little combination of a kind\r\nwhich really was so plainly in the open path, that everybody ought to be\r\nat liberty to use it. These, however, furnished the staple of the great\r\nmajority of Patents, which, though they did no practical good, operated\r\nto a great extent in hindering subsequent inventors in effecting further\r\nimprovements, because these Patents covered almost the whole ground of\r\neverything that could be possibly done. An inventor, unless he paid a\r\ntax to the owners of prior useless Patents, was exposed to litigation,\r\nand even if he were willing to pay the tax, the owners of the prior\r\nuseless Patent might refuse to grant him a licence. Thus for the space\r\nof fourteen years these useless Patents might not only do no good to\r\nthe public, but might actually stop the road to all further improvement\r\nduring that long period. On this subject evidence had been given by\r\nthree persons of eminence—Mr. Scott Russell, Sir William Armstrong, and\r\nMr. Platt. These gentlemen agreed in saying that the useless Patents to\r\nwhich he had just referred were a practical nuisance, and, if so, it was\r\nobvious from their number that they must be a very great nuisance. Mr.\r\nScott Russell said:—\r\n\r\n    “There are a great many Patents of this kind (practically\r\n    useless, but not appearing so on the face of them) taken out\r\n    for boilers of steam-engines, and boilers of steam-engines\r\n    admit of very enormous variety of shape and proportions,\r\n    without damaging their efficiency. The consequence is, that it\r\n    is hardly possible at this moment for a man having to scheme\r\n    a boiler for a new situation or new circumstances to avoid\r\n    putting his foot in so doing into a trap which somebody has\r\n    previously set for boilers.... Nearly the whole of the Patents\r\n    for the boilers of steam-engines at this moment are of no\r\n    practical value to inventors or to the public; but they are\r\n    continually getting every man who makes a boiler into a scrape\r\n    with some patentee, because almost every conceivable form of\r\n    boiler having been previously patented, and bit of a boiler,\r\n    one cannot make any sort of boiler without infringing some\r\n    man’s patent.”\r\n\r\nHe said precisely the same thing of screws. Then Mr. Platt, a well-known\r\nmachine-maker, said:—\r\n\r\n    “I think that there is scarcely a week, certainly not a month,\r\n    that passes but what we have a notice of some kind or other\r\n    of things that we have never heard of in any way, and do not\r\n    know of in the least, that we are infringing upon them; and\r\n    the difficulty is to get at any knowledge. We may be now\r\n    infringing, and may have been infringing for years, and a\r\n    person may have been watching us all the time, and when he\r\n    thinks that we have made a sufficient number, he may come down\r\n    upon us, and there is no record. If a thing is entirely new,\r\n    there is a record by getting a description; but what I mean\r\n    by a description is this—A very large number of Patents are\r\n    now taken out for what is termed a combination of known things\r\n    for the same purpose, and the descriptions of those Patents\r\n    are generally so bad that it is impossible to tell the parts\r\n    that are actually patented. It is only when you come into\r\n    court, or after making some compromise rather than go to that\r\n    expense, that you ascertain that fact, and very likely they\r\n    themselves in many cases do not know the parts that they have\r\n    actually claimed. It appears to me that, as to that question\r\n    of combination, the granting of Patents for things to do\r\n    precisely the same work in the same machine, with the addition,\r\n    perhaps, of a chain or a couple of bolts, or the form of the\r\n    lever changed, a straight lever made into a compound one; in\r\n    matters of that kind it has become a very serious question as\r\n    to conducting a large business.”\r\n\r\nThese were examples which it would be very easy indeed to multiply, and\r\nif the objections he had urged against the meritorious Patents were\r\nwell founded, what could be said in favour of the large proportion of\r\nPatents which were thus simply obstructing the trade and commerce of the\r\ncountry? Could any one doubt that in this advanced era of knowledge the\r\npublic would gain, on the whole, by the abolition of the Patent-Laws?\r\nBefore he left that part of the subject he wished to mention one very\r\npregnant fact. There was in this country a powerful consumer—he meant the\r\nGovernment—which, with respect to fire-arms, cannon, ships, and things of\r\nthat sort, would be placed in a very singular position indeed if it were\r\nsubject to the Patent-Laws. During the time he had the honour of being a\r\nlaw officer of the Crown, an extensive war was, as the House was aware,\r\nunfortunately raging, and a large number of Patents had come under his\r\nconsideration in connexion with so-called improvements in ordnance and\r\nships. It would be seen from the evidence to which his honourable friend\r\nhad referred that the authorities at the War-office and the Admiralty\r\nhad patentees swarming like hornets about their ears, and that the\r\npublic service seemed, in consequence, likely to be obstructed to a very\r\ninconvenient extent. The question was then tried whether the Crown was\r\nbound by Patents at all, and a decision was obtained to the effect that\r\nit was not. But while the Crown was free it should be remembered that the\r\npeople at large were subject to the law as it stood, and if in the case\r\nof the Government the claims of patentees were found to be monstrously\r\ninconvenient, it might not be difficult to believe that they operated\r\nin the same way in the case of the rest of the world also. He should\r\nnot enter into the minor details of the improvements which had been\r\nrecommended by the Commission, but there was another point to which he\r\nwished briefly to advert before he sat down; he alluded to the question\r\nof the protection of the public against invalid and bad Patents. The\r\nwhole argument in favour of Patents proceeded on the supposition that\r\nthe public were likely to be really benefited by some discovery which was\r\nworth the price of all the inconvenience and obstruction to which they\r\nwere exposed under the present system. But if they said that they gained\r\nnothing by the Patent, and that they only wanted to be set free, what\r\nwas the position in which they stood in reference to the cardinal point\r\nof protection against bad Patents? Was there really any protection in\r\nthat respect in the duties which were discharged by the law officers of\r\nthe Crown? It was impossible for the law officers of the Crown, acting\r\non the mere statement of the patentee, to know with certainty whether\r\na so-called discovery was new or not. They could only examine into the\r\nquestion whether an alleged invention, as described on the face of it,\r\nwas or was not satisfactory, but they could in no way protect the public\r\nagainst having an old thing put forward as a new, or a useless as a\r\nuseful invention. Indeed, the attempt by means of any sort of preliminary\r\ninvestigation to establish the utility or inutility of a Patent must,\r\nin his opinion, necessarily fail so long as the granting of Patents was\r\na matter of right and not of discretion. And what was the result when a\r\nPatent came to be disputed in a court of law? Everybody was aware that\r\nsuch litigation had acquired a reputation infamous beyond every other.\r\nIn the Paraffin Oil Company’s case, which had been referred to, the time\r\noccupied before Vice-Chancellor Stuart was not less than thirty whole\r\ndays. Why was so large an amount of time consumed in those cases? Because\r\nit was necessary to enter into the whole history of the discovery in all\r\nits numerous stages, and to beat up witnesses all over the country, so\r\nthat a voluminous mass of scientific evidence had to be produced. That\r\nwas the reason why the expense in those cases was so enormous, while the\r\npublic were in every point of view placed at an immense disadvantage, for\r\nthe presumption was in favour of the patentee, who, if he happened to\r\nhave succeeded in an action against another person, was entitled to have\r\nthe fact put in evidence in the case, and might subject his opponent to\r\nextra costs. But that was not all. In a case, he believed, of a Patent\r\nfor the purifying of gas by the use of metallic oxide of iron, it came\r\nout that there were two kinds of oxide, the hydrous and the anhydrous,\r\nand that the one would effect the object while the other would not;\r\nbut, because the terms were general, although everybody who tried the\r\nexperiment might arrive at the result desired, the Patent was held to be\r\nbad, and another person who took out a Patent for the hydrate had his\r\nPatent made good. Lord Westbury, who was as well acquainted with the\r\nsubject as anybody who had in recent times occupied the woolsack, said in\r\n1862, in speaking on that point:—\r\n\r\n    “To vitiate a Patent by prior publication, whether in a prior\r\n    specification or in a published book, &c., the antecedent\r\n    statement must be such that a person of ordinary knowledge\r\n    of the subject would at once perceive, understand, and be\r\n    able practically to apply the discovery without the necessity\r\n    of making further experiments. If anything remains to be\r\n    ascertained which is necessary for the useful application of\r\n    the discovery, that affords sufficient room for another valid\r\n    Patent.”\r\n\r\nIt would be seen, he thought, from what he had stated, that the\r\npublic were placed at a great disadvantage in the contest. In dealing\r\nwith Patent cases in a court of law there was generally a vast array\r\nof witnesses to be examined, consisting of mechanics, chemists, and\r\nscientific men of all sorts on one side and the other. Then there were\r\nthe jury, who knew nothing of the subject, and the judge, who might be\r\nplaced in a worse position, because he might imagine he understood all\r\nabout it when he did not. He did not, of course, mean to say that the\r\njudge did not sometimes understand it, but it might very easily happen\r\nthat an ingenious professional witness might so argue the case under the\r\nform of giving evidence as to lead the judge to think that he really knew\r\nall about it when such was not in reality the fact. Then the bias being\r\nin favour of the patentee, the result of such trials almost invariably\r\nwas, that if the matter happened to be of any practical importance, the\r\npublic were defeated, after having endeavoured to protect themselves at\r\nan enormous expense. He would not enter into minute details, but probably\r\nhe had said enough to show that a great practical evil arose out of\r\nPatent-Laws, and that for this evil there was little or no corresponding\r\nbenefit. He did not think that we should lose really valuable discoveries\r\nif the Patent-Laws were abolished. There might be some rare instances in\r\nwhich particular circumstances might give to particular inventors motives\r\nfor suppressing and facilities for suppressing discoveries which were not\r\npatented. But, assuming that to be possible in some cases, it operated\r\neven now, for it was well known that Patents were bought up for the\r\npurpose of being suppressed, and it was understood also that inventors\r\nwere the persons who derived the least advantage from their inventions.\r\nHis conclusion, therefore, upon the whole matter was that the time had at\r\nlast arrived—even if it had not arrived some time ago—at which the public\r\ninterest would be promoted by the entire abolition of the present system\r\nof monopoly.\r\n\r\n[This speech and the succeeding one have been obligingly revised for the\r\npress by the speakers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH OF THE RIGHT HON. LORD STANLEY, M.P.\r\n\r\n\r\nLord Stanley said that, agreeing substantially in the arguments of the\r\nhonourable and learned gentleman who had just sat down, he should not\r\nhave troubled the House if it had not been for the circumstance that\r\nhe was chairman of the Royal Commission which sat upon the question of\r\nthe administration of the Patent-Law some years ago, and he thought,\r\ntherefore, that it might be expedient he should state what was the result\r\nwhich that inquiry produced upon his mind. There was no doubt that,\r\nquite apart from the principle of the law, the details of the law, as\r\nat present administered, were not satisfactory; and, if the law were to\r\ncontinue in any form, he believed that in the report of that Commission\r\nvarious suggestions would be found by which the most prominent objections\r\nto its present working might be removed, and fair trial might be given\r\nto the principle itself. But it was impossible to carry on an inquiry\r\nof that kind, even limited as it was—it was impossible, at least, for\r\nhim, and he believed he was not the only one in that position—without\r\nfinding a doubt raised in one’s mind whether any Patent-Law could be\r\nframed in such a manner as not, upon the whole, upon the balance of good\r\nand evil, to do more harm than good. That conclusion, he was bound to\r\nsay, was totally opposed to his earliest impressions upon the subject.\r\nHe resisted it for some time, but the more he had to look into this\r\nmatter—the more he had to consider how great were the practical abuses\r\nand inconveniences of the existing system, and how difficult it would\r\nbe to remedy them—the more clearly it appeared to him that the evil\r\nwas really irremediable, being inherent in the principle itself. On\r\nthis subject of Patents there had been a certain amount of prejudice,\r\nparticularly in the minds of literary men, who appeared to think that\r\nCopyright was only a modification of the same principle, and that if\r\nPatents were abolished Copyright would follow. The analogy seemed a\r\nplausible one, but he thought that, on being looked into, it would not\r\nhold water. The difference was simply this: He did not rest it on any\r\nabstract ground as to the distinction between invention and discovery,\r\nbut on the obvious fact that no two men ever did or ever would write,\r\nindependently of one another, exactly the same book; each book, be it\r\ngood or bad, would stand alone; whereas it might happen, and often did\r\nhappen, that two or three men, quite independently of one another,\r\nwould hit upon the same invention. That alone established a distinction\r\nbetween the two cases. He was not disposed to place the objection which\r\nhe entertained to the system of Patents upon the ground of any abstract\r\nimpropriety in giving a man a property in ideas. To a certain extent you\r\ndid in the case of Copyright recognise a certain qualified and temporary\r\nproperty in ideas; and if it could be shown that a man’s ideas had been\r\nof a nature to add greatly to the wealth of the country, he did not\r\nthink that any abstract considerations of the kind mentioned by the\r\nhonourable member (Mr. Macfie) would induce anybody to grudge to such\r\na man any reward to which he might fairly be entitled, provided that\r\nthat reward could be given in a manner free from objection on other\r\ngrounds. The objections which he felt to the principle of Patents were\r\nthreefold. In the first place, you could hardly ever secure the reward\r\ngoing to the right man. In the next place, you could not establish any\r\nproportion between the public service rendered and the value of the\r\nreward received, nominally, for that service. And, thirdly, you could\r\nnot by any arrangement that he had been able to discover, prevent very\r\ngreat inconvenience and injury being inflicted upon third parties. With\r\nregard to the first point—the difficulty of securing that the reward\r\nshould go to the right man—it must be remembered that a Patent did\r\nnot, as some people supposed, bring to the holder of it an immediate\r\npecuniary recompense. All that it did was to give him a right to prevent\r\nany one else from using his invention without paying for it, and if that\r\nPatent were infringed he was entitled to take legal proceedings. But\r\neverybody knew that law was costly, and that Patent suits were the most\r\ncostly of all. It was notorious that Patents were continually infringed\r\nby persons who well knew they were infringing them, but relied upon\r\nthe inability of the inventor to incur the expense of defending his\r\nproperty. If a poor inventor took out a Patent, and the Patent promised\r\nto be productive, in nine cases out of ten he was obliged to sell it to\r\nsome one who could command capital enough to defend it in a court of\r\nlaw. If the Patent remained in his own hands, it was quite sure to be\r\ninfringed, and then he would probably be crushed by the law expenses. He\r\ndid not know whether it would be possible to obtain accurate information\r\nupon this point, but he really did not think he should be exaggerating\r\nif he said that in nine cases out of ten—probably in 99 out of 100—the\r\nreward was obtained, not by inventors or their representatives, but by\r\npersons who had bought the Patent on speculation and at a very low rate.\r\nHe said at a low rate, because there was a great deal of uncertainty\r\nabout such property, and until a Patent was tested by actual working you\r\ncould hardly say whether it was valuable or not. What was the practical\r\neffect of this? Why, that a few great firms in any branch of business,\r\nbuying up at a low rate any new Patent applicable to their business, and\r\nprepared to fight for it, could so hamper other competitors as to secure\r\na practical monopoly. The reward, therefore, did not, as a rule, go to\r\nthe men who, on the ground of the public service rendered by them, were\r\nintended to receive it. As to the second point—that the reward might be\r\ngreat and the public service very small—that had been dwelt upon by the\r\nhonourable and learned gentleman opposite, and little need be added to\r\nwhat had been said by him. The merit and novelty of the invention might\r\nin many cases be almost nothing, and, yet however obvious it might be,\r\nhowever much it might lie, so to speak, in the high road of discovery, if\r\nit applied to any article of general use, the pecuniary reward derived\r\nfrom it might be absolutely out of proportion to the novelty or value of\r\nthe invention. It would be easy to give instances, but he apprehended\r\nthat the fact was familiar to every one who had studied this question.\r\nThen, with regard to the injury to third parties, it commonly happened\r\nthat half-a-dozen men who were competing in the same line of business\r\nwere upon the track of the same discovery. Each of these half-a-dozen\r\nmen would probably have hit upon the invention which was wanted,\r\nindependently and without communication with the other. But the first who\r\nhit upon it, and who took out a Patent for it, was thereby entitled to\r\nexclude the general public and competitors from the use of that which,\r\nif he had never existed, they would probably have hit upon within a few\r\nweeks. A and B reached the same point, one a week or a fortnight before\r\nthe other, and A became entitled, by the mere accident of such priority,\r\nto exclude B from a process which, a little later on, B would have hit\r\nupon for himself. Another case was that where the successful working of\r\na process depended not upon one, but upon several successive inventions.\r\nThe first two or three, not leading to any immediate practical result,\r\nmight not have been thought worth patenting. The last link in the chain\r\ngave to the whole their commercial value, and it was the person who\r\ntook out the Patent for the last invention who got the benefit of the\r\nwhole, yet it might not be the most important invention in the series.\r\nHe would say nothing of the inconvenience and prejudice to manufacturers\r\nin general. That was obvious enough, and the question was whether there\r\nwas any counterbalancing advantage. These were the considerations which\r\nled him to the conclusion that it was impossible to defend our system\r\nof Patent-Law as it stood. At the same time, he did not at all disguise\r\nfrom the House that there were certain inconveniences and difficulties\r\nin the way of abolishing Patents altogether. You had to guard, in the\r\nfirst place, against the danger of encouraging inventors to keep their\r\ndiscoveries entirely to themselves. In some branches of business, no\r\ndoubt, that would be possible, and the obvious effect might be to shut\r\nout the public, for a much longer period than would be the case if\r\nPatents were allowed, from the use of some valuable invention. Then it\r\nhad been suggested by the honourable member who raised this debate that\r\nthere might be a system of State rewards for the encouragement of really\r\nmeritorious inventions. Without putting an absolute negative on that\r\nplan, he must observe that it was one which could only be established at\r\ngreat cost, and it would be a very difficult thing to apportion among\r\ninventors the rewards to which they might think themselves entitled. The\r\ndistribution of the rewards would give rise to endless complaints, and\r\nwould occasion, however unjustly, suspicions of jobbing and partiality.\r\nWith regard to the suggestion thrown out by the honourable and learned\r\ngentleman, of the possibility of granting Patents, not as a right, but as\r\nmatters of discretion only in certain limited and important cases, the\r\nSelect Committee considered that point, and he was bound to say that the\r\ndifficulty of carrying it out appeared to his mind almost insuperable.\r\nThere would be found great difficulty in drawing the line, and it would\r\nnot be an easy matter for any one to exercise so large a discretionary\r\npower as to decide to what inventions Patents should or not be granted.\r\nHe did not know what tribunal would be fit to exercise so great an\r\nauthority, and he was sure that none would be able to exercise it in a\r\nmanner to give satisfaction to the public. The most fit persons to decide\r\nin such a case would be the first to see the difficulty of deciding on\r\nany intelligible principle, and would on that ground decline to undertake\r\nthe duty. Under these circumstances it appeared that they were landed in\r\na position of great embarrassment. He was convinced that the Patent-Laws\r\ndid more harm than good, and if called on to say aye or no as to their\r\ncontinuance, he should certainly give his vote against them; but, as this\r\nwas a matter which required particularly careful handling, he should be\r\ncontent to leave the question in the hands of the Government, and he\r\nthought it was well worth consideration whether they could not, starting\r\non the ground that the abolition of the Patent-Laws, wholly or partially,\r\nwas desirable, institute some inquiry with the view of discovering, if\r\npossible, the best substitute for them in certain cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPATENT RIGHT.\r\n\r\n_Paper by Mr. J. Stirling, Presented to the Glasgow Chamber of Commerce,\r\nand published by permission._\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst: Patent-right cannot be defended on the ground of justice.\r\n\r\nThe object of a Patent-Law is to establish a “property in ideas:”\r\nbut this involves the double fallacy that thought can and should be\r\nappropriated. The end of all law is to ensure the universal freedom of\r\nhuman action. Hence the law of property secures to every man the product\r\nof his own labour. It gives to each an exclusive right to the material\r\nembodiment of his productive energy, to be possessed or alienated by him\r\nat will. But in so doing it leaves unrestricted the productive energy of\r\nevery other man. The freedom of one (as represented by his property) is\r\nthus consistent with the freedom of all.\r\n\r\nBut thought cannot be appropriated. In thought there is no material\r\nproduct to be made the object of a proprietary right. There is no\r\n“thing” to be possessed or alienated. The law can only, therefore, give\r\nthe exclusive use of an idea to one person by injuriously limiting the\r\nintellectual activity of all others. A Patent-right, therefore, is less a\r\n“property in ideas” than a monopoly of thought.\r\n\r\nAgain, a true right of property is universal in its application; it\r\nextends to the products of all industry, however humble. But it is\r\ninstinctively felt, that a proprietary right applied to every individual\r\nidea would be essentially absurd. Patent-Law, therefore, is essentially\r\npartial in its application. It picks out certain favourite ideas, and\r\nconfers on them an anomalous and oppressive privilege. There seems no\r\ngood reason why the ideas of inventors should be especially favoured.\r\nAn invention is a means to a special end, and should be recompensed by\r\nhim who has the end in view. If any ideas deserve a public recompense,\r\nit is those general ideas whose application is of universal utility. But\r\nPatent-Law ignores the discoverer of general ideas, and while conferring\r\nrewards, at the expense of the community, on empty schemers and puffing\r\ntradesmen, it passes over the services of a Newton or an Adam Smith. The\r\nlaw of Copyright, indeed, gives to the philosopher a right of property in\r\nhis published and material works, but it leaves (most justly) his ideas\r\nto be used and elaborated by whoso can and will.\r\n\r\nAgain, Patent-Law is founded on a conventional, not a natural, right.\r\nIt is not, like the ordinary law of property, based on an universal\r\nintuition of the human conscience, but it is one of those laws by\r\nwhich unwise legislators have striven so long and so vainly to give\r\nan artificial stimulus to human industry. Hence the arbitrary nature\r\nof its enactments. The ordinary right of property is unlimited in its\r\nduration—passing from generation to generation. But common sense revolts,\r\ninstinctively, against a perpetual monopoly of thought. A Patent-Law,\r\ntherefore, can never be more than a weak compromise with principle—the\r\nlegislator undertaking to secure to the patentee his ideal property\r\nduring the biblical term of seven or fourteen years. Now, if the inventor\r\nhave a right at all, he has a right to more than this. To cut down a real\r\nand acknowledged right of property to seven, or even fourteen, years were\r\na grievous wrong. Patent-right goes too far, or not far enough. Either a\r\nPatent is no right at all, or it is a right for all time. If ill-founded,\r\nit is a robbery of the public; if well-founded, of the patentee.\r\n\r\nMere priority affords no good ground for the exclusive right to an\r\ninvention. The free exercise of thought is the common right of all.\r\nWherefore if A excogitate a principle to-day, and B, by independent\r\nthought, excogitate the same principle to-morrow, both have an equal\r\nright to benefit by the discovery; and A has no natural right to debar\r\nB from the legitimate fruit of his intellectual effort. It may be even\r\nthat A had no real priority of thought, but was only more knowing, more\r\ngreedy, or was simply nearer to a patent office, and, though latest\r\nin arriving at the idea, was the first to secure a legal monopoly of\r\nits use. To found a right on such a race for priority is evidently\r\nirrational. The simultaneousness of discoveries and inventions by\r\ndifferent minds, is a well-established fact in the history of science.\r\nCertain facts and reasonings, all tending in a given direction, are\r\nbefore the world. These act simultaneously on various minds, and produce\r\nin each the same development of thought. Now, with what justice do we\r\npick out one of these many thinkers and give him a monopoly of the common\r\nthought? Nor is the injustice confined to the original idea, of which\r\nwe grant a monopoly. By tying up one idea, we stop the whole course of\r\nthought in a given direction, and thus interfere generally, and to an\r\nindefinite extent, with the intellectual activity of other men.\r\n\r\nThe inventor benefits by the ideas of the community, and has, therefore,\r\nno right to a special privilege for his idea. The universal thought of\r\nmankind is a common good; all benefit by it freely, and all are bound\r\nfreely to contribute to it. Every thinker owes an incalculable debt to\r\nsociety. The inventor has the benefit of all foregone human thought, of\r\nall existing civilization. He has the unbought advantage of all laws,\r\nall language, all philosophy. He has the free use of all the methods and\r\nappliances, spiritual and material, which have been painfully elaborated\r\nby the thinkers and workers of all time. Why, then, should he alone have\r\nan exclusive privilege, in respect of the infinitesimal addition which he\r\nmay make to the work of ages?\r\n\r\nSecondly: Patent-right cannot be justified on the lower ground of\r\nexpediency. The object of a Patent-Law, in the supposed interest of\r\nthe community, is to stimulate invention. But invention needs no\r\nartificial stimulus. Nature has amply provided all needful and wholesome\r\nencouragement, in the additional profit afforded by improved methods of\r\nproduction. In the natural course of business, every producer is spurred\r\non by his material interests to invent for himself or to encourage\r\nthe inventions of others. The whole history of industrial progress is\r\nan unceasing striving after improvement, with a view to profit. The\r\nfew thousand patented inventions are as nothing compared with the\r\ninnumerable improvements produced daily and hourly in the ordinary\r\ncourse of business, with the vulgar view of gain. The best stimulus\r\nto invention, therefore, will be found in the natural competition\r\nof producers; but Patent-Law destroys this competition by an unjust\r\nmonopoly, and thus tends indirectly to weaken the natural impulse to\r\nimprovement.\r\n\r\nInvention may be even over-stimulated. In all her arrangements, Nature\r\nprovides for a due equilibrium of powers and tendencies. Thus the various\r\nfaculties and temperaments of man—the sanguine and the cautious, the\r\nspeculative and the practical—are nicely balanced. The result, when\r\nthings are left to themselves, is a happy combination of ingenuity\r\nand caution, and, as a consequence, a continuous but prudent course\r\nof improvement. But if, by conventional rewards, we give a factitious\r\nimpulse to the inventive faculty, we destroy the natural equilibrium of\r\ncapacities, and foster a scheming, fanciful turn of mind, at the expense\r\nof thoroughness and a patient working out of sound ideas. This result\r\nhas actually occurred in the United States, where the factitious value\r\nattached to invention has tended to produce an almost total sacrifice of\r\nsolid workmanship to a flimsy ingenuity.\r\n\r\nPatent-Law does not even attain its proposed end of quickening the\r\nprogress of real improvement; on the contrary, it is found in practice\r\nseriously to hinder it, the monopoly granted to one inventor necessarily\r\nobstructing the progress of every other. Hence, an eminent inventor\r\nhas lately said: “The advance of practical science is now grievously\r\nobstructed by those very laws which were intended to encourage its\r\nprogress.” That Patents seriously obstruct the natural development of\r\nideas, is best seen by the sudden advance which usually follows the\r\nexpiry of important Patent-rights. The natural course of improvement,\r\ndammed back by artificial obstruction during the continuance of the\r\nPatent, is set free on its conclusion, and a new impulse is given to the\r\ndevelopment of ideas and their practical application.\r\n\r\nBut the public is not the only sufferer by Patent-right. Without doubt\r\nthe heaviest evil falls on the patentee. The inventor is led to give\r\nan excessive development to his talent, and is seduced into reliance\r\non a law that can give him no substantial protection. The difficulty\r\nof defining original inventions is a practical bar to a satisfactory\r\nPatent-Law. The whole history of Patents is a long-continued story of\r\nlitigation and disappointment; and the more admirable the invention, the\r\ngreater is the certainty of difficulty and loss. It must be a worthless\r\ninvention that the patentee is left to enjoy in peace. Whenever a Patent\r\nis worth pirating, the inventor may depend on being involved in a maze\r\nof litigation that disturbs his peace and ruins his fortunes. And the\r\nmore the Patent privilege is extended, the worse the evil becomes; the\r\nintricacy and the multiplicity of details baffling every attempt to\r\ndefine the rights of competing inventors.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the heaviest complaints against Patents come from our\r\ngreat inventors. They repudiate the proffered privilege as “injurious\r\nto inventors,” and complain of being “borne down by an excess of\r\nprotection.” As is natural, they who are most occupied with the\r\nadvancement of invention, feel most acutely the grievous obstructiveness\r\nof the Patent-Law. Not enough that they have to battle with natural\r\ndifficulties; at every step they meet obstructions which a well-meaning\r\nbut perverse law places in their way. Nor do these obstructive privileges\r\nconfer any real advantage on the empty schemers whose monopoly they\r\nestablish: they merely give them the vexatious power of hindering the\r\nprogress of better men. The mere “pen-and-ink inventor” has neither\r\nthe energy, nor the perseverance, nor the practical ability to mature\r\nhis crude “idea;” but to this man the law awards the dog-in-the-manger\r\nprivilege of effectually obstructing the natural progress of practical\r\nimprovement.\r\n\r\nThese practical evils the advocates of Patent-Law do not deny; but\r\nthey attribute them to the defective execution of the law, not to its\r\nvicious principle. Hence a never-ending cry, as in the case of all bad\r\nlaws, for more legislation, for more stringent regulation, for stricter\r\ninvestigation, and more thorough registration of Patents. But no\r\ntinkering at details can avail. The whole system is radically unsound;\r\nand the only effectual remedy is to lay the axe to the root.\r\n\r\nA sentimental plea in favour of Patent-right has been set up by some, on\r\nthe ground that the inventor—the man of thought, as he is called—must\r\nbe saved from the toils of the capitalist, ever ready to prey on his\r\nsuperior intellect. This silly sentimentalism could only originate in an\r\nutter ignorance of the relations which naturally subsist between capital\r\nand talent. The capitalist is the natural ally of the inventor, whom\r\nit is his interest to employ and encourage. It is a chief part of the\r\nbusiness of every producer to search out every one who can help him to\r\nimproved methods of production; and the remuneration which, in one shape\r\nor another, it is the interest of the capitalist to offer to the really\r\nclever inventor, will always form a surer and more substantial reward\r\nthan the delusive privilege of a legal monopoly. As to the complaints\r\nwe hear of neglected talent, we may safely conclude that they arise\r\nmore from the exaggerated pretensions of conceited schemers, than from\r\nany obtuseness to their own interests on the part of practical men of\r\nbusiness, who refuse to profit by their inventions.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, Patent-Law seems a blunder, founded on the antiquated\r\nnotion of giving State encouragement to certain favoured modes of human\r\nactivity. It is no part of the duty of the State to stimulate or reward\r\ninvention; the true function of Government is to protect, not to direct,\r\nthe exercise of human energy. By securing perfect freedom to each\r\nindividual, we shall best provide for the progress of the community; nor\r\ncan any law be conceived more detrimental to the common weal than one\r\nwhich lays restrictions on perfect freedom of thought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARE INVENTIONS PROPERTY?\r\n\r\nBY M. T. N. BENARD, EDITOR OF THE “JOURNAL DES ECONOMISTES,” JULY, 1868.\r\n\r\n(_Translated and Reprinted by his obliging consent._)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the number of the _Journal des Economistes_ for last December there\r\nappeared a very conscientious paper on “Property in Inventions,” by our\r\nlearned colleague, M. le Hardy de Beaulieu. We would have preferred that\r\nsome master of the science had published an answer to this article, which\r\nit seems to us is based on a wrong principle, and that he had given to\r\nthe readers of this journal the opposite view of those ideas so ably set\r\nforth by the honourable Professor of Political Economy at the Belgian\r\n“Musée de l’Industrie.”\r\n\r\nWe believe that this question has acquired sufficient importance and\r\nreality to merit being fully argued and cleared up; and, no other having\r\ntaken up the pen in answer, we shall endeavour to set forth the principle\r\nwhich alone appears to us true and admittable.\r\n\r\nWe throw out these ideas for discussion, hoping that the subject will be\r\ntaken up by one of our masters in the science, and that this great debate\r\nwill be carried out in a manner suitable to the imperishable doctrines of\r\njustice and equity, which form the basis of political economy.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n“The man who first made a hut,” says M. le Hardy de Beaulieu, “a piece\r\nof furniture, a cloak, or some necessary of life, would no doubt have\r\nthereby excited the envy of his neighbours, and he would frequently\r\nhave been deprived of these objects by violence or by strategy, before\r\nit would be generally allowed that they ought to belong to him who made\r\nthem, and that it was at once the duty and the interest of the community\r\nto guarantee him their possession against every attack.”\r\n\r\nWe acknowledge that the man who first constructed a hut was perfectly\r\nright in making good his claim against those who would have deprived\r\nhim of it, and that he was justified in vindicating his claim by force.\r\nHe had employed his time and strength in building this hut; it was\r\nundoubtedly his, and his neighbours acted up to their natural right and\r\nin their own interests in helping him to oppose the intruder. But there\r\nended both the right of the individual and that of the community.\r\n\r\nIf this first man, not content with claiming his hut, had pretended\r\nthat the idea of building it belonged exclusively to him, and that\r\nconsequently no other human being had a right to build a similar one, the\r\nneighbours would have revolted against so monstrous a pretension, and\r\nwould never have allowed so mischievous an extension of the right which\r\nhe had in the produce of his labour.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, this man had exercised imagination and combination; he\r\nhad invented the shape, the size, and the arrangement of the whole\r\nstructure; he was the first to conceive—probably after many efforts\r\nof mind and thought, after long study, after observations made on the\r\nnests of birds and the hut of the beaver—that pile of branches, of dead\r\nwood, of leaves and of stones, of which its shelter is formed. He was\r\nan inventor of the first class. How is it, then, that the sentiment of\r\njustice which prompted him to claim his property did not prompt him at\r\nthe same time to claim exclusive possession in the idea, the result of a\r\nlong train of reflection? How is it that the same sentiment of justice\r\nwhich induced his neighbours, the community, to lend him armed force\r\nto preserve for him the possession of his hut, did not go so far as to\r\ngrant him a property in his idea? No one dreamed of asking him for the\r\npermission to imitate what he had made; no one thought he was committing\r\na crime, or doing him a wrong, in making a copy of his hut.\r\n\r\nProperty can be a right only when its principles tend to the general\r\ngood and are useful in advancing the interests of the human race. And\r\nif, in our day, imitation of an invention is not generally considered as\r\nguilty an act as robbery of tangible property, it is because every one\r\nunderstands the difference between an idea and a thing made or done.\r\n\r\nThe inventor of a particular weapon, or certain furnishings, or tools,\r\nhad all possible rights in the constructing and possession of these\r\nweapons, furnishings, or tools; but these rights could not be extended\r\nto the hindering of his neighbours from making tools, furnishings, or\r\nweapons, in every way similar. If the community had admitted an exclusive\r\nright in these inventions, it would have died in its germ, civilization\r\nwould have been a dead letter, and man would have been unable to fulfil\r\nhis destiny.\r\n\r\nThus far, then, there was not, nor could be in principle, any question\r\nof exclusive right of invention. This right was only thought of when\r\nall notions of social right had been obscured by laws which, like that\r\nof Henry II., declared that the right of labour belonged to the Crown,\r\nand when there had grown up the idea of licensing labour and granting\r\nexclusive privileges for its exercise. The institution of the pretended\r\nproperty in inventions was a retaliation against the suppression of the\r\nabusive right of masterships and corporations.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nDoubtless invention, as M. le Hardy de Beaulieu remarks, consists in\r\nthe discovery of a new scientific principle; but we cannot admit, with\r\nthe learned Professor, that the new application of a principle already\r\nknown, that the discovery of a natural agent hitherto unknown, or of new\r\nproperties or other modes of action of natural agents, or of materials\r\npreviously discovered, are inventions.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that coal was known long before any one thought of putting\r\nit in a stove to be used as fuel. It is certain that stone was known long\r\nbefore any one thought of employing it in the construction of walls.\r\n\r\nTo pretend that the discovery of the combustible quality of coal, or\r\nof the use to which stone might be put, gave a right to the discoverer\r\nto exact from his neighbours the payment of a royalty before employing\r\nthis fuel, or this material for construction, is also to grant that he\r\nwho, centuries before, had thought of burning wood to warm himself, or\r\nof seeking the shelter of a cave, ought also to be recompensed for the\r\ntrouble he had in discovering, appropriating, and working out either this\r\nsource of heat or this means of shelter.\r\n\r\nInvention, we acknowledge, consists in the discovery of a new scientific\r\nprinciple; it can often place, as M. le Hardy de Beaulieu says, new\r\ngratuitous forces at the disposal of the community; but does it follow\r\nthat the inventor has an exclusive right in the property of this\r\ndiscovery? We think not. The inventor of the compass, whoever he was, has\r\nrendered an immense service to the community; but could his invention be\r\nclaimed as private property? Does it not, on the contrary, enter with\r\nperfect justice into the public domain?\r\n\r\nNapier, the discoverer of logarithms, has rendered the most signal\r\nservice to calculators and navigators; but can his invention, the\r\nknowledge of which may, either orally or by the printing-press, be\r\nextended indefinitely—which any one may use privately, in the quiet of\r\nthe study—be put upon the same footing as landed property, which a single\r\nman may cultivate—as house property, which may belong to one or several,\r\nand which cannot be seized upon without its being observed, and to the\r\ngreat scandal of all? Evidently not.\r\n\r\nAnd if the law has never tried to appropriate inventions of this class,\r\nit is because there must be something tangible, limited, and final,\r\ngiving the power to regulate its employment or possession.\r\n\r\nIt is not correct to say, besides, that the inventor does not deprive\r\nthe community of any portion of the common property which it possessed\r\nbefore the invention. Before the invention the thing discovered existed\r\nin embryo—in nature. This germ was multiple; it existed as frequently as\r\nthere were men; and the inventor pretends, by the property in it which he\r\nclaims, to deny it to all others and to hinder its germination.\r\n\r\nThe right of the inventor is limited to that of working out his idea; it\r\nis identical with that of a man who has discovered and cleared a field;\r\nbut it is not, like his, exclusive. He who invents and he who clears can\r\npossess their property as long as they like and as they like; but there\r\nis this difference between the field and the invention: the first can be\r\ncultivated only by one without doing an injury to the proprietor, while\r\nthe invention may be used by several without hindering, diminishing, or\r\nsuppressing the working of it by the inventor.\r\n\r\nI have cleared a field, and cultivate it; if one of my neighbours desires\r\nalso to cultivate the same field, he hinders me from exercising my\r\nright—he interferes with my working—he dispossesses me.\r\n\r\nI have discovered the combustible nature of coal: in what way does my\r\nneighbour, who cooks his food on a coal fire, hinder me from exercising\r\nmy right, or interfere with the working of my faculties? of what does he\r\ndispossess me?\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nWe have not, as we think, to take into consideration more or less the\r\ndifficulties of inventors; we have not to inquire if every invention\r\nrequires a more than ordinary degree of intelligence, special knowledge,\r\ngreat perseverance, &c. There is a multitude of occupations in life\r\nwhich require all these qualities, but no one has ever pretended that on\r\naccount of these qualities, probable sources of success for them, they\r\nhad a right to any favours, immunities, or privileges.\r\n\r\nThe inventor of a useful discovery has quite as much, or more, chance of\r\nmaking a fortune as the manufacturer who confines himself to the beaten\r\ntracks, and only employs the known methods; this last has had quite as\r\nmuch risk of being ruined as any searcher after discovery. We believe\r\nthat they are on an equality as to position; for if the inventor may be\r\nruined in not finding what he seeks, the manufacturer may see all his\r\nlooms or his machines rendered useless, all his outlets closed, by the\r\nintroduction of a cheaper means of production. Why make a golden bridge\r\nfor him who enters the arena with arms more subtle and more finely\r\ntempered than those of his adversary?\r\n\r\nNotice that the manufacturer also renders a service to the community—no\r\ndoubt in seeking his own profit; but is it not so with the inventor? Why\r\nthen demand a reward for the one which is not asked for the other?\r\n\r\nThe manufacturer who, in using the old looms, manages his factory so as\r\nto reduce his prices by 10 or 20 per cent., and who in consequence can\r\nfurnish stockings (supposing him to be a stocking manufacturer) to a\r\nnumber of those who were not rich enough to buy them at the old prices,\r\nundoubtedly does a service to the community equal to that which it would\r\nreceive from the invention of a machine which would make the stockings 10\r\nor 20 per cent. cheaper.\r\n\r\nThe farmer who by superior ploughing, more skilful manuring, or more\r\ncareful weeding, increases the yield from two to three quarters per\r\nacre—does not he also render a signal service to the community?\r\n\r\nThe sailor, who finds the means of shortening voyages by utilising\r\ncertain currents or winds, in modifying the spread of his sails, &c.—does\r\nnot he increase the gratuitous natural forces placed at the disposal of\r\nthe community?\r\n\r\nWhy, then, if there is question of rewarding this class of services,\r\nshould they not ask for privileges, favours, and exclusive rights? Why\r\nnot go so far as forbid any one to arrange his factory on the plan of the\r\nmanufacturers of whom we have been speaking? Why not forbid any farmer\r\nto weed, plough, or manure, like his neighbour; or any sailor to follow\r\nthe track of the first, without paying to those who gave the example a\r\nprevious and perpetual royalty?\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n“The property of an invention having required for its creation the same\r\nlabour as that of the soil, and this work offering less chance of success\r\nand results of probable less duration, it is as legitimate at least as\r\nlanded property,” says M. le Hardy de Beaulieu; “and there is no argument\r\nagainst it which may not be applied with equal force to the individual\r\nand permanent occupation of the soil.”\r\n\r\nThe soil, to render all the productions that the community has a right\r\nto expect from it, ought to become and remain a personal individual\r\nproperty. Invention, on the other hand, cannot give all the results that\r\nsociety can draw from it, unless it be public property.\r\n\r\nHerein lies the immense and irreconcilable difference between property\r\nin land and that of invention. Besides, land cannot become unfertile,\r\nunproductive, or lose all its value as property, except by some\r\nconvulsion of nature which would deeply unsettle it. An invention, on the\r\ncontrary, may become quite valueless in ten years, one year, a fortnight\r\neven, after being discovered, and that by the superiority of a subsequent\r\ninvention.\r\n\r\nWhat becomes, then, of the property of this invention? What is its worth?\r\nHas the inventor a right to damages?\r\n\r\nIf you construct near my field a factory from which escape noxious\r\nvapours, hurtful to vegetation, and if I can show that you have\r\ndeteriorated or destroyed my crops, you, according to the laws of every\r\ncivilised nation, owe me damages; would you claim damages of the\r\ninventor, whose discovery had rendered that of one of his predecessors\r\npartially or completely unproductive? If property in invention is equal\r\nto property in the soil, damages are incontestably due. We do not think\r\nthat a single advocate for this class of property has, however, dared to\r\ncarry his logic thus far.\r\n\r\nThe proprietor of a field may leave it uncultivated, the proprietor of a\r\nhouse may leave it shut up as long as he likes; no law obliges to put in\r\na tenant, or to open it for lodgers. The laws of all countries contain,\r\nwith slight modifications, the following clause, quoted from Art. 32 of\r\nthe Law of 1844:—“Will be deprived of all his rights ... the patentee\r\nwho shall not have commenced the working of his discovery or invention\r\nin France within two years, dating from the day of the signature of the\r\nPatent, or who shall have ceased working it during two consecutive years,\r\nunless that, in one or other case, he can satisfactorily explain the\r\ncauses of his inaction.”\r\n\r\nIt would be very easy for us to cite other differences in the nature\r\nof these two classes of property; we shall only refer to one more,\r\nwhich points out how solid is the property in land, and how uncertain\r\nand ephemeral the so-called property of invention. Land, considered as\r\nproperty, increases in value from day to day; there is no invention whose\r\nvalue does not diminish daily.\r\n\r\nM. le Hardy de Beaulieu further adds, that “the inventor, in taking\r\nexclusive possession of his idea, harms no one, since he leaves all\r\nwhich previously existed in the same condition in which he found it,\r\nwithout in any way lessening the social capital on which he drew.” We\r\nshould require, however, to come to an understanding as to what may be\r\ncalled the social capital; for if the exclusive property of invention had\r\nexisted from the germination of the idea which led to the construction\r\nof the first hut to the making of the earliest weapons, tools, and\r\nfurniture, it is difficult to know where we should find it. By putting\r\nproperty in invention on the same footing as property in the soil, all\r\nthat man uses or consumes would belong to the descendants of the first\r\ninventors, and every one would require to pay a sort of rent for its\r\nuse. The inventor of the wheelbarrow would have to pay a royalty to the\r\ninventor of wheels, and the maker of the plainest pump would pay an\r\nannual rent to the inventor of the lever or piston; there would not,\r\nthere could not, be any social capital.\r\n\r\nBut it is wrong to say that the exclusive possession of an idea hurts no\r\none, because it leaves what previously existed in the same condition.\r\nI, or my neighbour, might put together ideas to form the basis of an\r\ninvention; this faculty of combination belongs to each of us; with\r\nexclusive possession it belongs only to one. It cannot be said, then,\r\nthat no one is hurt, and that everything remains in the same position.\r\n\r\nAfter having said that the property of invention is in every respect\r\nsimilar to property in the soil, M. le Hardy de Beaulieu places,\r\nnevertheless, boundaries to the extent and duration of the first. He\r\nsays: “It is not meant precisely that property in an invention ought\r\nto extend over the globe, nor that its duration should have no limit in\r\ntime; all property, in fact, is bounded by the cost of preservation,\r\nmaintenance, and working, which it requires, already, long before the\r\nlimit of space or time when the produce of the property no longer covers\r\nthe expense, the proprietor does not require to defend it against\r\nseizure, and from that time it becomes public property.”\r\n\r\nIt follows that property of invention is not identical with property in\r\nland or other material objects. A diamond which belongs to me in any\r\ncorner of the globe, the cotton stuffs which I have sent to Bombay or\r\nSaïgor, are still my property until I have voluntarily ceded them. My\r\ndescendants, or those of some rightful owner, will cultivate in four or\r\nfive hundred years or more the field which I may now possess. There is no\r\nlimit of time nor of space for real property; it remains for ever.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nThe whole history of humanity protests against this assertion of M.\r\nle Hardy de Beaulieu, that inventions “being realisable only on the\r\ncondition of a just remuneration, sufficient for the exceptional work\r\nwhich they require, and of a compensation in proportion to the risks they\r\ncause, property in them, which alone can assure this remuneration and\r\nthis compensation, is necessary.” Let us remark, first, that by a just\r\nand sufficient remuneration he probably means a special, exceptional, and\r\nexclusive one.\r\n\r\nWe will now ask it to be observed that man’s most indispensable and\r\nuseful tools were invented, and were everywhere in daily use, many years\r\nor centuries before there was any question of property of invention. We\r\nshall only cite the hammer, the file, the saw, the screw, the pincers,\r\nthe plough, spades, needles, &c.\r\n\r\nDid any of the inventors of these tools take out a Patent? Did he who\r\nfirst put a shoe on a horse claim a property in the idea?\r\n\r\nAll the great inventions, with the exception of a few of the most modern,\r\nand for which it was not possible to take a Patent, date from the\r\nearliest times. Who, then, invented the art of smelting the ores of iron,\r\ncopper, lead, and tin? of making malleable iron and steel? When did man\r\nfirst invent the manufacture of glass, of pottery, porcelain, paper, ink,\r\nboats, and carriages?\r\n\r\nRailways existed in a rudimentary state in the coal mines of\r\nNorthumberland and Durham long before Patents were dreamed of. Printing\r\nand gunpowder appeared in the world without the guarantee of Patents;\r\nso also with the tanning of hides, the spinning of thread, weaving,\r\ndyeing, printing, &c. The electric telegraph is the result of a series of\r\nstudies, and of the social capital of knowledge which these studies, and\r\nothers foreign to the object as it were, have formed. Patents or rewards\r\nwhich have since been granted only concern modifications, more or less\r\ningenious, of the original principle.\r\n\r\nFor what are inventors now doing? Without seeking in any way to detract\r\nfrom the merit of their labours, we may boldly assert that they modify in\r\na profitable and economical way the older processes; instead of welding\r\niron, they roll it; instead of the cold, they use the hot blast, in\r\nsmelting.\r\n\r\nTo the tanning of hides they add currying, shamming, graining, polishing,\r\n&c. Are these services which cannot be sufficiently rewarded in the\r\nfree working of the idea? Are they services which exceed by a hundred\r\ncubits those rendered by great manufacturers, large capitalists, intrepid\r\nseamen, or profound thinkers? And if, carrying out the argument of M. le\r\nHardy de Beaulieu, we should say, credit being necessary to the progress\r\nof the community, and being realisable only on condition of a just and\r\nample remuneration for the exceptional labour which it requires, and of\r\na recompense proportionate with the risks incurred, the community ought\r\nto grant to the bankers exceptional rewards, or assure to them a special\r\nand perpetual privilege,—should we not be going on the premisses of the\r\nlearned Belgian Professor?\r\n\r\nNo doubt that branch of credit, the issue of notes, is at present allowed\r\nin many countries to the great privileged banks; but may not the same\r\narguments apply to discount, the receiving of deposits, quite as well as\r\nto the issue of notes?\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nTo admit, with M. le Hardy de Beaulieu, “that the rights of inventors\r\nare useful even to non-inventors,” we must allow that the progress of\r\ninvention would be stopped if the privileges guaranteed by Patents\r\nwere withdrawn. Now, we have already said that all human history up to\r\na very recent period demonstrates the weakness of the assertion. Man\r\nhas invented from the time he began to think and compare, and he will\r\ncontinue to invent while he exists on this planet. Invention is nothing\r\nelse than thought.\r\n\r\nIf, as M. le Hardy de Beaulieu says—but which we doubt—there be no\r\nfear that property in invention allows the inventor to exact for his\r\nservices a higher price than they are worth, neither need it be feared\r\nthat the absence of this right of property would hinder the inventor\r\nfrom obtaining by his discovery all the profit which he has a right to\r\nexpect from it. This fear would only be justified in the event of his\r\nbeing deprived by law of the right of using his own discovery. Now, this\r\nright remains intact; only it is not exclusive. If the inventor saves\r\nlabour or outlay, the inventor will profit by this saving, like his\r\nneighbours; he will profit by it before his neighbours; he will profit by\r\nit exclusively so long as he can keep his secret, and while his opponents\r\nare establishing rival works on the same principle.\r\n\r\nM. le Hardy de Beaulieu tells us that the inventor can never take\r\nadvantage of his property to hold an unjust and injurious monopoly.\r\n\r\nWe will quote one example of a thousand from M. Louis Reybaud’s excellent\r\nwork on wool. Speaking of the wool-carding machines, the learned\r\nAcademician thus writes: “There may be cited twenty names engaged\r\nin these discoveries, incomplete as a whole, almost all fortunate\r\nin some detail. What is incomplete is laid aside, what is fortunate\r\nis so much gain; the new comers discriminate and choose. After a\r\nperiod of twenty years there are only three processes in use—those of\r\nLeister, Hellsmann, and Hubner; of analogous merit, and each having its\r\npartisans. Will they strive one with another? No, they compromised. M.\r\nHolden gets the assignment, and also acquires, either by purchase or\r\nby judicial decisions, the rights of Donisthorpe, Noble, and Croft.\r\nMessrs. Schlumberger and Co., the assignees of Heilman, retain only\r\nthe manufacture of certain machines. We may imagine the wealth of a\r\nbusiness established on so many purchases and decisions. M. Holden has\r\nadded inventions of his own, and _he may be considered the master of\r\nwool-carding until his Patents expire_. Nothing is more interesting\r\nthan the answers he gave on this subject before the Commission on the\r\nCommercial Treaties. On his own avowal he is proprietor of 45 Patents,\r\n28 taken by himself, and 17 purchased from others. In these 45 are good,\r\nmiddling, and bad. He works them all _in obedience to the law_ and _to\r\nguard against lapses_. In the bad, as well as the good, there is an idea\r\nto defend and a chance of upsetting; he fears that in abandoning them\r\nthey might be used against him; _for one machine in constant use there\r\nare forty-four which make a pretence of working; he does not hide it—it\r\nis his interest to hinder, as much as to work_.\r\n\r\nWhat would it be if, as it is demanded, property in invention, put on the\r\nsame footing with property in the land, were perpetual? By the present\r\nsystem it may be the interest of one man to fetter improvement, and,\r\nhaving acquired the mastery of it, to mortally wound it wherever it\r\nappears! Is this not already too much the case?\r\n\r\nMust we, then, repeat what reason and experience teach us, that unjust\r\nexactions cannot be made under a system of open competition, but always\r\nspring up under the shelter of privilege?\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\nThe eminent Professor of the “Musée de l’Industrie Belge” makes a just\r\nand well-founded criticism on the diverse laws of different countries\r\nrelating to Patents. Usually law-makers do not appear so perplexed, nor\r\ncontradict themselves so frankly; this is because, when we forget what\r\nis right, when we leave principles to make a legal caprice, we sail over\r\nunknown seas, where no lighthouse guides us, nor compass shows us the\r\nright direction.\r\n\r\nHe attributes to the defective state of these laws “the almost unanimous\r\ncensure displayed either against the legislation or against property in\r\ninventions.”\r\n\r\nWould it not be more reasonable to acknowledge that if the learned\r\nlaw-makers of the numerous countries in which the principle of property\r\nin inventions has been adopted have not been able to frame laws capable\r\nof protecting the rights of pretended proprietors conjointly with those\r\nof individuals and society at large, it is because the principle is\r\nradically wrong, and contrary to the general interests of mankind? The\r\nlaw-giver finds an obstacle at every side in legitimate scruples; he\r\nfears to give too much, and he fears to take too much.\r\n\r\nAt present the censure is almost unanimous, it is acknowledged. Let us\r\nsuppose that property in invention were abolished, and what complaints\r\nwould result from the abolition? Few or none. When the inventor knew\r\nthat, placed on the same level as all other workers, he must only rely\r\non his intelligence, his capital, his time, and his right arm he would\r\nleave off claiming a privilege and complaining of the insufficiency of\r\nhis rewards. At present the inventor says to the State: “I have found\r\nout a great thing, but I require your protection; you must place at my\r\ndisposal your agents and your law-courts; the first shall enter the homes\r\nof my fellow-citizens, shall search their drawers, examine their books\r\nand papers, in my interest. By the second, their cause being lost, shall\r\nbe condemned to ruin and misery. I am about to bring ruin on such and\r\nsuch manufacturers, to condemn a crowd of work-people to idleness; but\r\nyou must grant me a privilege which will place me beyond the reach of\r\nall opposition, and allow me to make a fortune, quietly and without much\r\nchance of a failure.”\r\n\r\nWhat difference do the champions of Patents find between this language\r\nand that which was held by the Protectionists? They also required\r\nCustom-house officers, and law-courts always open, to punish the\r\nsmuggler; they further required the ruin of those who traded with distant\r\ncountries, and the continual inactivity of our mercantile marine and\r\nsea-board population.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\nThe honourable Belgian economist next combats the opinion of those\r\nwho, struck by the numerous and weighty inconveniences presented by\r\nthe Patent-Laws, and their extreme diversitude in every country, have\r\nimagined a remedy in the expropriation of invention for the public good.\r\n\r\nWe shall be far from attaining our object if the reader has not\r\nalready understood that, renouncing all idea of property as applied\r\nto manufacture, we shall not discuss this phase of the question. We\r\nwill say, however, that we must protest with all our might against the\r\nfollowing principle, expressed by M. le Hardy de Beaulieu: “Neither can\r\nwe admit,” says he “the justice of expropriation for the public good so\r\nfar as it concerns property in inventions any more than in real property.\r\nHere also,” he adds, “the _right_ of one ought to prevail over the\r\n_interest_ of the greater number.”\r\n\r\nIt is no doubt intentionally that the word _interest_ in this phrase is\r\nput in opposition to the word “right.” But would it not be more correct\r\nto say, the _right_ of the community ought to prevail over the _interest_\r\nof the individual.\r\n\r\nIndividual right in property is certainly worthy of respect, and cannot\r\nbe called in question; but to our thinking, the right of the community\r\nprecedes and is superior to it. A part cannot be greater than the whole;\r\nno one can place his right above that of mankind, and the individual\r\ncannot oppose his will, good or bad, on the whole community.\r\n\r\nWe belong to no learned corporation—a simple volunteer in the army of\r\neconomist disputants—and have no other banner than that of the truth;\r\nbut we cannot refrain from saying one word in defence of those whom the\r\nlearned Belgian speaks of among many others in these terms: “The judgment\r\nof the Academy of Sciences on the steamboat invented by Fulton may help\r\nto form an estimate of the contradiction which experience sometimes\r\ninflicts on the best-intentioned verdict of a committee of _savants_.”\r\n\r\nWe assert as a fact that if the steamboat presented to the Academy of\r\nSciences by Fulton were now submitted to the judgment of a committee of\r\nmachine builders, they would declare unanimously that the boat could not\r\nnavigate. We wish in no way to seek to depreciate the acknowledgments\r\nwhich mankind owes to Fulton; but his invention, as all are at starting,\r\nwas only a sketch, which required half a century of labour to perfect and\r\nto make as practical as it now is.\r\n\r\nHere there is room for an observation which must be noted.\r\n\r\nThe advocates for the principle of property in inventions fall into\r\necstacies before a transatlantic steamer, and exclaim, “Behold, what a\r\ncrying injustice! what deplorable ingratitude! Society has denied the\r\nrights of the inventor to this wonder of the sea! He died in poverty, or\r\nnearly so.”\r\n\r\nOthers go further back, and attribute to Solomon de Caux, or to Papin,\r\nall the honour; they forget that between Papin, or Solomon de Caux\r\nand Fulton, a crowd of men of genius brought their contributions\r\nof knowledge, experiment, and work of every kind; and that between\r\nFulton and the makers of our day there are so many inventors, so many\r\nexplorers, fortunate or unfortunate, ridiculous or serious, whose\r\nattempts or applications have helped to perfect the steam-engine, that it\r\nmay truly be said that every one has had a hand in it.\r\n\r\nIt is the same with the railway, the electric telegraph, and the\r\ndifferent machines for spinning, carding, weaving, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\nTo pretend, as does the defender of the principle of property in\r\ninventions, in the ninth paragraph of his work, that the sudden and\r\ninconsiderate introduction of a new invention may cause a sensible\r\ninjury to existing manufacturers, and that it is consequently advisable\r\nto maintain the system of Patents, which during a certain time limits\r\ntheir use and hinders production, to prevent the lowering of prices\r\nimmediately at least; so to pretend is to renew the plea of the protected\r\nmanufacturers, who demanded that the greatest precautions should be\r\ntaken to facilitate the transition from Protection to Free-trade. But\r\nwe do not see clearly what benefit there can be to the community at\r\nlarge in delaying the advantages to be derived from an invention. The\r\nmisunderstood interests of certain manufacturers may appear to require\r\nthis delay, but common sense tells us that manufacturers and consumers\r\nhave every interest in immediately adopting every invention which saves\r\nlabour, capital, and time.\r\n\r\nIf we look back, we will see that a delay of this kind would have\r\nretarded for an indefinite period the discoveries of Columbus in order\r\nto avoid a sensible injury to the monopoly which Venice had acquired in\r\nEastern commerce. We maintain, as indeed experience proves, that however\r\ninnovating inventions may be, displacement of labour occurs gradually. We\r\nwill only cite, in support of this assertion, the well-known instance of\r\nthe substitution of printing for manuscript copying. It may be answered\r\nthat the substitution of mechanical spinning and weaving for hand-work\r\ncaused great suffering. We answer, that you should blame the system of\r\nPatents, which, raising inordinately the cost of the machines, must\r\nhave restricted labour, although they lowered the price of the product.\r\nIf there had been no royalty to pay to the inventor, the number of the\r\nmachines would have rapidly increased, and a greater number of workmen\r\nwould at once have found employment similar to that to which they had\r\nbeen accustomed.\r\n\r\nHow many enterprising and intelligent speculators would most eagerly have\r\navailed themselves of these new outlets for their activity, if the course\r\nhad been cleared of all these obstructions which the law has arbitrarily\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\nAt the risk of being considered by the honourable Professor grossly\r\nignorant of the laws of political economy, we do not believe that\r\nmonopolies will always exist, as he ventures to affirm. We know that\r\nthere always will be intellectual superiority, unrivalled artistic\r\nability, or special natural advantages; but these do not constitute\r\nmonopolies, in the proper acceptation of the term; and the object we\r\nshall not cease to strive for is that no others shall exist.\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\n\r\nIt is beyond our province to consider the inquiries of M. le Hardy de\r\nBeaulieu as to the best plan of securing to inventors exclusive right in\r\ntheir discoveries. To take up this question is to undertake the discovery\r\nof the philosopher’s stone, or the squaring of the circle; several\r\ngenerations have vainly grappled with it, and the different attempts\r\nmade without satisfactory results in almost every country prove this\r\nconclusively.\r\n\r\nBut the honourable Professor seems to calculate on the improvement of\r\npublic morals, in order to reach the point where every attempt against\r\nthe property of the inventor shall be considered as guilty as robbery, or\r\nas any injury done to property existing in material shape.\r\n\r\nUnder the uncompromising Protective system also it was attempted to\r\nimprove the morals of the public, who would not see the equal guilt of\r\nthe smuggler and the robber, and always loudly protested when repression\r\nwas enforced by bloodshed.\r\n\r\nNo reform of public morals will change the nature of these acts; they\r\nwill always be received as the appeal of right against abuse; and we\r\nwould deeply pity the country where it would be sufficient to say such is\r\nthe law, and where no conscience might protest against it.\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.\r\n\r\n“Discovery, the appropriation and creation of outlets, is too complicated\r\na work,” says M. le Hardy de Beaulieu, “for the inventor singly, and\r\nespecially without the aid of capital, to undertake with sufficient\r\nchance of success.”\r\n\r\nHere again we believe the learned economist is in error; he seems to\r\nimagine one inventor arriving at perfection either at a jump, or after\r\nmany attempts—one inventor giving us at once our ocean steamer, or a\r\nspinning-mill with a hundred thousand spindles! Inventions go more\r\nslowly; when they spring from the brain of the thinker, they are only\r\nsketches, and no man in his senses will risk a large capital before\r\nmaking many trials, and that only on a small scale. We do not believe\r\nthere has been a single invention which, after numerous trials, has not\r\nbeen modified, improved, and perfected.\r\n\r\nAnd how many have at last been thrown into oblivion, from which they will\r\nnever be recalled?\r\n\r\nAlso, when we see the defenders of property in invention draw a sad\r\npicture of the piercing miseries which inventors of these last have had\r\nto endure, we are always tempted to ask them to show us the pitiful\r\naccount of ruin caused among those who placed faith in their promises\r\nand delusions. Every medal has its reverse, and if more than one real\r\ninventor has been misunderstood, many of the too-confident have been\r\nvictims of the mad and inapplicable ideas of inventors who imagined\r\nthemselves men of genius.\r\n\r\nIs the law, which seems to promise an Eldorado to all inventors, to blame\r\nfor these losses, for these undeserved sufferings?\r\n\r\nBernard de Palissy’s saying, “Poverty hinders the success of the clever\r\nman,” is often quoted. But this saying will always be true, whatever the\r\nlaw may be. Can we admit that if perpetual property of invention had\r\nexisted in his time, Bernard would more easily have found the money which\r\nhe required?\r\n\r\nThe success of an invention is secured by the services it can render\r\nbeing easily understood, immediate, and speedily realisable. The\r\ncapitalist, in dealing with hazardous undertakings—and inventors’\r\nundertakings “are always hazardous”—does not calculate on perpetuity.\r\nHe works for immediate and large profits; he is in a hurry to realise,\r\nbecause he knows that some other invention may dispossess him of all his\r\nadvantages. Little does he care, therefore, about the perpetuity.\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.\r\n\r\nIn his twelfth and last paragraph the learned Professor answers several\r\nminor objections to the system of property in inventions—objections which\r\nseem to us not to carry great weight.\r\n\r\nHowever, in answer to the objection taken from the case of two\r\napplications for similar Patents, made at intervals of a few minutes\r\nonly, the eminent economist says that this case occurs only at rare\r\nintervals, and making light of the rights of the slower, affirms that it\r\nis not worth considering. Does not this denial of a right on account of\r\nits infrequency, however, seem to show how arbitrary and artificial is\r\nthe constituting of property in invention?\r\n\r\nWe are among those who believe in the harmony of all economic relations,\r\nof all legitimate interests; and when we see the right of one sacrificed\r\nto false exigencies, we mistrust the exigencies. We believe them unjust\r\nand contrary to the principles of equity, which forms the basis of all\r\neconomic science. We should wish to have seen M. le Hardy de Beaulieu\r\nmore logical in his deductions, claiming, as he has done, for real\r\nproperty [la propriété foncière] that the right of one ought to prevail\r\nover the interest of the greater number, and give a chance of obtaining\r\nan indemnity, if he could not be assured of a part of the property\r\n[Donner ouverture a l’obtention d’une indemnité si l’on ne pouvait lui\r\nassurer une part de propriété].\r\n\r\nBut we repeat, these questions of the arrangement [organization] of\r\nproperty, which we do not acknowledge, are beyond our province, and\r\nif we accidentally touch upon them, it is only to show how little the\r\nfoundations of this right are similar to those on which rests the\r\nprinciple of material property.\r\n\r\nIn recapitulation, we reject property in inventions and the advantages\r\nclaimed for it, because it seems to us that all this scaffolding of legal\r\nprescription and Government protection only results in throwing out of\r\ntheir natural course a crowd of workmen who would become more useful to\r\nsociety and to themselves in ceasing to pursue chimeras.\r\n\r\nWe reject the proposed assimilation of this property to that of the\r\nsoil, because the privilege sought to be created cannot fail to hinder\r\nand lessen the right of each member of the body politic. We reject\r\nthis privilege because nothing justifies it; the services rendered to\r\nsociety by inventors being nowise different in their nature from those\r\ndaily conferred by skilful manufacturers, intelligent agriculturists,\r\n_savants_, navigators, &c.\r\n\r\nFinally, we reject it because history attests that great discoveries were\r\nmade before there was any conception of such property, and that it could\r\nhardly be in operation at this day, except with regard to modifications,\r\nor, if you will, improvements [perfectionnements], which do not merit\r\nthis abstraction from the common right.\r\n\r\n\r\nADDITIONAL CHAPTERS (FROM THE MAY NUMBER OF THE _JOURNAL DES\r\nECONOMISTES_).\r\n\r\nThe question of granting or denying a property in inventions is of\r\nsuch importance that the discussion raised by the honourable Belgian\r\nProfessor, M. le Hardy de Beaulieu, ought not to be allowed to drop, and\r\nthat we should try to renew it.\r\n\r\nWe believe it to be of importance for the future of manufactures and of\r\nprogress, and most especially to the security of real property, that\r\nwhatever is doubtful and disputed in this question be deeply studied, and\r\nthat all should be agreed as to what property is, and if this title ought\r\nto be applied to all or any of the inventions which daily start up.\r\n\r\nM. le Hardy de Beaulieu pretends that one of the most frequent errors\r\nof those whose enlightenment ought most to guard them against it\r\nis to believe that property being inherent in matter, is, like it,\r\nimperishable, and that property in land especially is as durable as the\r\nland itself. He adds that we should beware of it, because this error\r\nlays open landed property without defence to the attacks of communists\r\nand socialists, who, sliding down the incline of irresistible logic, are\r\nfatally led to declare all property illegitimate, to whatever purpose it\r\nis applied.\r\n\r\nHere, it seems to us, is a misunderstanding which may be easily explained.\r\n\r\nWe do not believe that property is inherent in matter, any more than\r\nwe believe that value is confined to any given substance. We believe\r\nthat property is the result, the consequence, of human labour which\r\nhas been incorporated in matter. As long as value conferred on land by\r\nlabour endures, so long the property has a _raison d’être_, and cannot\r\nbe contested. It is labour which has allowed the utilisation of the\r\nproductive faculty of the soil, and productive faculty remains, like the\r\nproperty, as long as labour is bestowed in preserving, improving, and\r\nincreasing it.\r\n\r\nM. le Hardy de Beaulieu adds that he could cite numerous examples of\r\nlands abandoned or sold at a nominal price by their owners, either\r\nbecause they had exhausted and rendered them unproductive by an\r\nunintelligent culture, or because they had not been able to withstand\r\nthe competition of more fertile soils, recently brought into cultivation\r\nor brought nearer the common centre of consumption by a considerable\r\nreduction in the expense of transport.\r\n\r\nWe do not contest this fact, of which the exactness may be verified any\r\nday in the increase or diminution of the value of property induced by the\r\nvarious changes brought about either in the grouping of the population,\r\nin the modes of culture, or in the means of transport. There are,\r\nhowever, few lands completely abandoned; to find examples, we should\r\nprobably have to go back to those fatal times when by force of conquest\r\nproprietors were removed or all their means of culture and production\r\nwere suddenly seized.\r\n\r\nBut we do not see how this can help the argument of M. le Hardy de\r\nBeaulieu. It has small relation, it seems to us, to the question of\r\nproperty in inventions, that—perpetual by law, as long as labour\r\ncontinues and renews it—landed property should sometimes come to an end\r\nby occurrences or violence such as we have been speaking of.\r\n\r\nHowever, to state all our thoughts on the subject of landed property,\r\nwe must confess (and here may be seen in all its clearness the radical\r\ndifference between placing under culture, or cropping land, and working\r\nan idea), the vindication of property is found in the fact that land\r\ncan only be cultivated by one at a time, must be subject to one will,\r\nand under one direction. It would be to my injury and the injury of the\r\nentire community that Peter should be allowed to plant potatoes in the\r\nfield where Paul has already sowed wheat, or that James should open a\r\nquarry where John has built a house, and so on.\r\n\r\nAs we have already said, the power of the lever, the laws of gravity,\r\nthose of the expansion of steam, the attraction of the magnet, the\r\ncaloric of coal, the facility of traction imparted by the wheel, the\r\noptical properties of glass, &c., may be utilised to the great profit of\r\nall, in a thousand different ways, by a thousand individuals at once,\r\nwithout the efforts of any one being diminished, hindered, obstructed,\r\nor lessened, as to their useful result, except by the beneficent laws of\r\ncompetition.\r\n\r\n“The first cause of property,” says M. Matthieu Walkoff,[4] “is the\r\nimpossibility of matter being moved in more than one direction at one\r\ntime, or, to state it otherwise, of its being subject at one time to more\r\nthan one will.” “If matter,” says this eminent economist, “were gifted\r\nwith ubiquity, like ideas, knowledge, or truth, which several may use\r\nsimultaneously, and each in his own way, property would never have been\r\nconstituted; and it is even difficult to imagine how any idea on this\r\nphenomenon could have arisen in men’s minds.” “In fact,” he adds, “to\r\npreserve property in an idea would have required that it should never\r\nhave been expressed nor practised, to hinder it, being divulged, which\r\nwould have been equivalent to its non-existence.”\r\n\r\nWe do not go so far as M. Walkoff; we do not affirm that the\r\nimpossibility of matter being subject at one time to more than one will\r\nis the _first cause_ of property; but we say it is the distinctive\r\ncharacter of property, and, like him, we cannot see a subject, for\r\nproperty is a shape, plan, or system, which, to see once, as in a spade,\r\nthe wheel, the corkscrew, is to possess an indelible idea.\r\n\r\nBesides, the author whom we have quoted expresses so clearly our opinion\r\non this subject, that we must further borrow from him the following\r\nquotation, which will not be uncalled for at a time when property itself\r\nis threatened. It is of importance that the lawful bounds should be\r\ncarefully marked:—\r\n\r\n“Economists have too much neglected the first cause of the perpetual\r\nsubjection of matter to exclusive property. They made property to be\r\nderived only from a man’s original possession; from himself and his acts;\r\nthat which leads to possession of the result of his activity. But this\r\nreasoning only establishes the indisputable right of the appropriation\r\nof that which he appropriates or produces; it does not explain why\r\nexclusive property in material things is permanent, and does not show how\r\nthe very nature of things renders this possession inevitable. It is to\r\nthe incomplete understanding of the causes of property that is probably\r\nattributable the contradictions of those economists who, while professing\r\nthe doctrine of free labour, are still in favour of the establishment of\r\nartificial barriers against the free use by every one of ideas, skill,\r\nprogress, and other products of the mind, conceived and suggested, or\r\nrealised, by any one.”\r\n\r\nLet us remark here that in fact the manufacturing community, more liberal\r\nin practice than the economists in theory, are eager freely to submit\r\nto inspection at exhibitions the processes in use at their different\r\nfactories.\r\n\r\n“To require that an idea be subject to only one will,” continues M.\r\nWalkoff, “is to require no less an impossibility than to pretend that\r\na material point can obey more than one will—that is to say, that it\r\ncan be moved in more than one direction at once. It is true that it is\r\nnot proposed to hinder ideas from being developed; it is desired simply\r\nto convert their reproduction or their material realisation into an\r\nindefinitely prolonged monopoly. But, in order completely to succeed in\r\nanything, it is necessary that the object aimed at be in conformity with\r\nthe nature of things. Now, is it not placing oneself in opposition to\r\neverything which is most natural, this denying to every one the use of\r\nan idea? And even where this interdict is most successful, we soon find,\r\nin a manner most unassailable by the law, works copied from those to\r\nwhich the law has guaranteed a monopoly. The effect of the interdict is\r\nhere, as in all regulations contrary to the nature of things, essentially\r\ndemoralising; it begets fraud, entices to it, even forces to it, in\r\nmaking it useful and often even indispensable. Forbid men, as was once\r\nsupposed by the witty author of the ‘Sophismes Economiques,’ the use of\r\nthe right hand, after a few hours, there would not remain, in the eye of\r\nthe law, a single honest man. It may be boldly affirmed that such a law\r\nwould be immoral, and all those which recklessly contradict the natural\r\norder of things are incontestably such.”\r\n\r\nIn fact, we repeat, the field which I turned into a garden may not\r\nbe used by my neighbour as a pasture-land for his cattle; where I\r\nhave planted a vine another may not plant colza or beet-root; but the\r\nsteam-engine which I have invented, or the electric power which I have\r\ndiscovered, may be applied to the grinding of corn, or the spinning of\r\ncotton, or to the extraction of iron, or to the draining of a marsh,\r\nor to traction by land or sea, without the productive force being\r\nneutralised, wasted, or lost, like the application of the productive\r\nforce of the soil to different purposes.\r\n\r\nNot only do the various applications of the idea not hinder the inventor\r\nin the employment which he may make of it, but if the application made by\r\nothers is exactly the same as his, he is only subjected to the universal\r\nlaw of competition—a law of progress, if ever there was one.\r\n\r\n[4] Precis d’Economic Politique Rationale, page 44; Paris, 1868.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. M. le Hardy de Beaulieu asks, “Why the effort which consists in\r\nrendering productive some natural agent in which this quality was not\r\nformerly recognised, should not entitle to a recompense of property in\r\nthe value given to the natural agent in rendering it productive, in the\r\nsame way that labour bestowed on barren land to render it productive,\r\nto the profit of all, makes him proprietor of that portion of land who\r\nperformed this labour?”\r\n\r\nHere is our answer: He who renders productive some natural agent has an\r\nincontestable property in that agent which he has rendered productive,\r\nbut not in all similar or identical agents in nature; he who converts\r\na certain quantity of water into steam, to obtain a motive force, is\r\nincontestably proprietor of the water he employs and of the steam, as\r\nwell as of the force which he obtains, but the remainder of the water,\r\nand of the steam which may be produced from it, and the force which may\r\nbe derived from it, remain the common property of mankind; that is to\r\nsay, each should have it in his power to employ an unlimited quantity of\r\nwater to obtain the same results. The man who first broke up and sowed a\r\nfield never could have claimed as property all the ground in the world;\r\nhe only retained for himself, and that reasonably and justly, the portion\r\nwhich he had reclaimed and rendered fertile by his labour.\r\n\r\nWe may add that he who renders productive some natural agent avails\r\nhimself in this work of all the acquired knowledge and all the work\r\npreviously done, and he would unduly monopolise it if the community\r\nrecognised his exclusive right to it.\r\n\r\nIt is said that Pascal invented the wheelbarrow; did he not borrow from\r\nthe social capital both the wheel and the axle, and the two arms, not to\r\nspeak of the species of box which forms with the other parts the whole\r\nwheelbarrow?\r\n\r\nOur learned opponent maintains “the perfect identity between the labour\r\nof discovery, and of the putting the soil in culture, and of this same\r\nlabour applied to other natural agents which did not exist in indefinite\r\nquantity; and he makes the deduction, having the same result, that\r\ninventors placing at the disposal of mankind new quantities of gratuitous\r\nutility, not hitherto available, deserve the same reward—property in the\r\nnatural agent, or portion of this agent, whose gratuitous services have\r\nbeen acquired by mankind.”\r\n\r\nWe must allow that we do not know of any natural agent of which the\r\nquantity is not indefinite, excepting only the earth; but steam,\r\nwind, light, electricity, magnetism, the force of attraction, that of\r\nweight, the affinity of particles, their divisibility, their different\r\nproperties, may be employed in whatsoever quantities, and still there\r\nwould be no perceptible diminution or restraint in the use of them\r\nto any one. The only possible restraint is that which comes from the\r\nunreflecting action of the law, from artificial hindrances and obstacles\r\nwhich may be made law.\r\n\r\nWe believe, with Bastiat, that the greatest service that could be\r\nconferred on mankind would be to remove the obstacles which stand between\r\nhis efforts and the supply of his wants.\r\n\r\nHow does M. le Hardy de Beaulieu not see that no one has the right to\r\nmake burdensome that which is naturally gratuitous, and that it is just\r\nto exact that no one should appropriate any part of what constitutes\r\ncommon property?\r\n\r\nThat learned Professor of the Brussels Museum tells us the inventor has\r\na right to say to the manufacturer, “Find out my process for yourself\r\nif you can, search for it as I have done; but if you wish to spare\r\nyourself this labour, and avoid the risk of spending it in vain, consent\r\nto yield me a part of the expenses which I save you in simplifying your\r\nappliances.” And he asks us if we find this demand unjust or unreasonable.\r\n\r\nNot only do we find this demand just and reasonable, but we maintain\r\nthat it is the only one we can recognise. But M. le Hardy de Beaulieu\r\nforgets that, according to the Patent-Laws, things are not thus arranged.\r\nThe inventor, with the law in his hand, and the law courts to support\r\nhim, says to the manufacturer, “It is forbidden to you to search and to\r\nfind; or if you search and find, you are forbidden to use the power or\r\nthe agent when you have found it: the process which I have invented is\r\nmy property, and no one has the right to use it, even if his researches,\r\nhis labour, enable him to discover it; even if he had commenced the\r\nsearch before me, all his labour is lost. I alone am proprietor of this\r\nagent, power, or process.” If this system be right, he who first rendered\r\nproductive the most indispensable natural agent could have confiscated\r\nthe whole world to his profit.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nM. le Hardy de Beaulieu acknowledges that the savage who first thought of\r\nsubstituting a hut, as a habitation, for the cave, has not the right to\r\nforbid the construction of others like it.\r\n\r\nThis concession is as important as the preceding, and we shall probably\r\nend in agreeing. We must now inquire where may be found the exact limit\r\nbetween inventions of which imitation is allowed, and those in which it\r\nis forbidden.\r\n\r\nThe man who first made a canoe from the trunk of a tree, either naturally\r\nhollow or artificially by fire, or otherwise,—may he forbid his\r\nneighbours to make one like it?\r\n\r\nIf he may, where, then, is the difference between the hut and the boat?\r\nIf not, what is the reason for this prevention?\r\n\r\nFrom the boat we might gradually go on, up to the latest Patent, by\r\ninvisible transitions; and we have still to find the exact point at\r\nwhich M. le Hardy de Beaulieu might say, There is the limit!\r\n\r\nWe do not know whether, in the absence of all positive right which would\r\nguarantee a recompense to the inventor of the hut, a natural sentiment\r\nof justice would prompt the savages living in that country to make him\r\na present of some useful object as a reward for this service, as M. le\r\nHardy de Beaulieu suggests. We doubt it much; gratitude is an analytic\r\nvirtue. The savages would probably have a certain respect for this\r\nman, whom they would look upon as gifted with superior qualities and\r\nfaculties, but the presents would only arrive when, the contemporary\r\ngenerations being extinct, cheats and hypocrites would found on the\r\ninventions of this man some system of religion.\r\n\r\nYes, we acknowledge the truth and justice of the principle in virtue of\r\nwhich it is said, “Reward for merit.” But it must not be abused. Let a\r\ncultivator make a thousand trials, a thousand experiments, to give to the\r\npotatoes all the elementary qualities, all the nutritive virtue of wheat,\r\nand arrive at the object of his researches—to what recompense will he be\r\nentitled? According to the system of M. le Hardy de Beaulieu, no reward\r\ncould equal the service which this individual would have rendered to\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nAccording to the system of non-property in inventions, this man would\r\nonly have made his trials and his experiments—he would only have risked\r\nhis advances of money, of time, and of labour—with the view of being able\r\nto sell his potatoes at a higher price than before, and, in fact, they\r\nwould command a higher price, by means of which he would find himself\r\nsufficiently rewarded. This man asks nothing of society; he requires\r\nneither Patent, nor guarantee, nor monopoly, nor privilege; because the\r\nlaw has wisely placed beyond the reach of Patents all improvements in\r\nagriculture.[5] Does this imply that agriculture no longer progresses,\r\nthat the breeder of cattle does not improve, that they remain completely\r\n_in statu quo_? It is not from M. le Hardy de Beaulieu that we learn that\r\nthe want of Patents does not hinder for an hour the progressive advance\r\nof agriculture; quite the contrary.\r\n\r\nEstablish the same system for all that concerns manufactures, and\r\ninventions will follow one another as rapidly as they now do. They will\r\nbe more serious, for those who are engaged in them will no longer be\r\nexcited by the allurements which the Patent-Laws dangle before their\r\neyes, and will no longer lose their time in running after useless things\r\nand mere chimeras.\r\n\r\nWe do not wish to prolong too far this answer, but we cannot pass in\r\nsilence the arguments which M. le Hardy de Beaulieu thinks he has found\r\nin the facts relating to the inventor of the mariner’s compass, and\r\nto the discoveries of Lieutenant Maury. We will simply remind him of\r\nthe following passage from Bastiat: “He who can gain assistance from\r\na natural and gratuitous force confers his services more easily; but\r\nfor all that, he does not voluntarily renounce any portion of his\r\nusual remuneration. In order to move him, there is required external\r\ncoercion—severe without being unjust. This coercion is put in force by\r\ncompetition. So long as it has not interfered—so long as he who has\r\nutilised a natural agent is master of his secret—his natural agent\r\nis gratuitous, no doubt; but it is not yet _common_; the victory is\r\ngained, but it is for the profit of a single man, or a single class.\r\nIt is not yet a benefit to all mankind. Nothing is yet changed for the\r\nmultitude, unless it be that a kind of _service_, though partly rid of\r\nthe burden of labour, exacts nevertheless full pay [_la rétribution\r\nintégrale_]. There is, on one hand, a man who exacts of all his equals\r\nthe same labour as formerly, although he offers in exchange only his\r\nreduced labour; there is, on the other hand, all mankind, which is still\r\nobliged to make the same sacrifice of time and labour to obtain a product\r\nwhich henceforth nature partly realises. If this state of things should\r\ncontinue with every invention, a principle of indefinite inequality\r\nwould be introduced into the world. Not only we should not be able to\r\nsay, value is in proportion to labour; but we should no more be able\r\nto say, value has a tendency to be in proportion to labour. All that\r\nwe have said of _gratuitous use_, of _progressive community_, would be\r\nchimerical. It would not be true that labour [_les services_] is given in\r\nexchange for labour [_des services_] in such a manner that the gifts of\r\nGod pass from hand to hand, _par-dessus le marché_, on the man intended\r\n[_destinataire_], who is the consumer. Each one would always exact\r\npayment for not only his labour, but also for that portion of the natural\r\nforces which he had once succeeded in applying. In a word, humanity would\r\nbe constituted on the principle of a universal monopoly, in place of the\r\nprinciple of progressive community.”—_Harmonies Economiques_, Vol. vi.,\r\np. 354.\r\n\r\nWe think, with Bastiat, that the use of natural agents ought to be\r\ngratuitous, and that no one has the right to artificially monopolise in\r\nsuch a way as to exact royalties [_prélever des redevances_], which are\r\nnot due, and which often are obstacles almost as insurmountable as those\r\nwhich invention ought naturally to remove.\r\n\r\n                                                             T. N. BENARD.\r\n\r\n[5] Unfortunately, this is not true of British law. The illustration\r\nfounded on it is (like the rest of these papers) admirable.—R. A. M.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH OF MICHEL CHEVALIER, AT THE MEETING OF THE “SOCIÉTÉ D’ÉCONOMIE\r\nPOLITIQUE,” ON THE 5TH JUNE, 1869.\r\n\r\n(From the June Number of the _Journal des Economistes_.)\r\n\r\n\r\nM. MICHEL CHEVALIER, Senator, proposed to consider Patents in their\r\nrelation to freedom of labour [_la liberté du travail_], a corner-stone\r\nof modern political economy, and to the principle of the law of property,\r\nwhich is greatly respected by economists and which serves them as guide.\r\n\r\nDoes the principle of freedom of labour accommodate itself to that of\r\nPatents? It may be doubted. All Patents constitute a monopoly; now, it is\r\nindisputable that monopoly is the very negation of freedom of labour.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Patents, it is true, monopoly has a limited duration; but\r\nin France this duration generally extends, if the Patent is worth it,\r\nto fifteen years; which makes a long time in our day when the advances\r\nof manufacturers are so rapid and so quickly succeed one another. A\r\nhindrance or an obstacle which lasts fifteen years may greatly damage and\r\nseriously compromise important interests.\r\n\r\nIt would be easy to exhibit by examples the extent and the importance of\r\nthese disadvantages.\r\n\r\nIn France the manufacturer to whom a new apparatus or a new machine is\r\noffered is always in uncertainty whether the invention proposed is not\r\nalready the subject of some Patent, the property of a third party, in\r\nwhich case he would be exposed to the annoyance of a law-suit at the\r\ninstance of this third party. It follows that he frequently hesitates\r\nabout adopting a machine, apparatus, or method of work, which would be an\r\nadvantage not only to the manufacturer, but to the community at large,\r\nwhom he might supply better and cheaper. Another case which occurs to us\r\nis that of a manufacturer in whose factory an improvement has suggested\r\nitself. He is forced to take out a Patent, and consequently to observe\r\nformalities and undertake expenses with which he would rather dispense;\r\nhe is obliged, and becomes a patentee, whether he will or no; because,\r\nif he did not, it might happen that the improvement might come under the\r\nobservation of one of the numerous class of Patent-hunters. This man\r\nmight take out a Patent, which is never refused to the first comer; and\r\nonce patented, he might annoy and exact damages from the manufacturer\r\nwith whom the invention, real or pretended, actually had its birth.\r\n\r\nIn France the annoyances which Patents may occasion are very serious.\r\nIt is well known that, by the French law, the patentee may seize not\r\nonly the factory of the maker, but also, wherever he may find it, the\r\nmachine or apparatus which he asserts to be a piracy of that for which he\r\nhas taken a Patent. He may take it away or put it under seal, which is\r\nequivalent to forbidding the use of it. M. Michel Chevalier thinks that\r\nthis is a flagrant attack on the principle of the freedom of labour.\r\n\r\nIt can also be shown how, in another way, labour may be deprived of its\r\nnatural exercise by the monopoly with which patentees are invested.\r\nWhen an individual has taken out a Patent for an invention, or what he\r\nrepresents to be such, no one is allowed to produce the object patented,\r\nor use it in his manufacture, without paying to the patentee a royalty,\r\nof which he is allowed to be the assessor, and which sometimes assumes\r\nlarge proportions. The result is, that the produce manufactured can only\r\nbe offered in foreign markets at a price so augmented that the foreigner\r\nrefuses it if some other producer, residing in a country where the Patent\r\nis not acknowledged, establishes competition. Thus, for instance, France,\r\nwhich worships Patent-right, cannot export the “Bessemer” steel to\r\nPrussia, because there this product is not patented; whereas in France,\r\non the contrary, it is subject to a heavy royalty, on account of the\r\nPatent.\r\n\r\nThe same thing may be said of velvets, which have been very much in\r\nfashion, and for which a French manufacturer took out a Patent. The\r\neffect of this Patent was, that French manufacturers of this stuff were\r\nshut out from the foreign markets, because outside France they had to\r\nencounter the competition of Prussia, whose manufacturers were not\r\nsubject to any royalty, the Patent not being acknowledged there.\r\n\r\nIn our day, when export trade excites so great an interest among all\r\nmanufacturing nations, and has so much influence on the prosperity of\r\ninternal commerce, M. Michel Chevalier believes that the observation\r\nhe is about to make ought to be taken into serious consideration. At\r\nleast it follows, according to him, that before approving and continuing\r\nthe present system of Patents, it would be necessary that they should\r\nbe subjected to uniform legislation in every country. Now there are\r\nmanufacturing nations—Switzerland, for instance—which absolutely refuse;\r\nthere are others where Patents are subjected to so many restrictions that\r\nit is as if they did not exist; such is Prussia.\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of the right of property, it is contended that\r\nPatent-right should be respected, since it only assures property in\r\ninvention in the interest of him to whom the community is debtor. M.\r\nMichel Chevalier sees in this argument only a semblance of the truth. We\r\nmust first inquire whether an idea may really constitute an individual\r\nproperty—that is, exclusive personal property. This pretension is more\r\nthan broached. A field or a house, a coat, a loaf, a bank-note, or credit\r\nopened at a banker’s, readily comply with individual appropriation,\r\nand can hardly even be otherwise conceived of; they must belong to an\r\nindividual or to a certain fixed number of persons; but an idea may\r\nbelong to any number of persons—it is even of the essence of an idea that\r\nonce enunciated, it belongs to every one.\r\n\r\nBesides, is it certain that the greater part of patentees have had an\r\nidea of their own, and that they have discovered anything which deserves\r\nthis name? Of the great majority of patentees this may be doubted, for\r\nvarious reasons.\r\n\r\nThe law does not impose on the individual who applies for a Patent the\r\nobligation of proving that he is really the inventor. Whoever has taken\r\nout a Patent may very easily turn it against the real inventor; this has\r\noccurred more than once.\r\n\r\nBesides, the law lays it down as a principle that it is not an idea that\r\nis patented, and constitutes the invention valid; and thus it excludes\r\nfrom the benefit of patenting the _savants_ who make the discoveries, of\r\nwhich Patents are only the application.\r\n\r\nIt is by the advancement of human knowledge that manufactures are\r\nperfected, and the advancement of human knowledge is due to _savants_.\r\nThese are the men prolific in ideas; it is they who ought to be rewarded,\r\nif it were possible, and not the patentees, who are most frequently only\r\ntheir plagiarists.\r\n\r\nM. Michel Chevalier does not desire systematically to depreciate\r\npatentees. Among them there are certainly many honourable men. The\r\ninventions, real or pretended, which they have patented are supposed to\r\nbe new and ingenious uses or arrangements [dispositions], by help of\r\nwhich we put in practice some one or more specialities of manufacture;\r\ntrue discoveries are always due to the _savants_. But in general these\r\narrangements, represented as new, have no novelty.\r\n\r\nIn the detailed treatises on Mechanics, Physics, and Chemistry, in books\r\nof technology, with their accompanying illustrations, such as are now\r\npublished, we find an indefinite quantity of combinations of elementary\r\napparatus, especially of mechanical arrangements, and very often the work\r\nof professional patentees consists in searching through these so numerous\r\ncollections for uses and arrangements, which they combine and group.\r\nWhat right of property is there in all this, at least in the greater\r\nnumber of cases?\r\n\r\nAgainst the pretended right of property alleged by the defenders of\r\nPatents there will be much more to say. There exists in the greater\r\nnumber of cases much uncertainty about the inventors, even when true and\r\nimportant discoveries are in question. Is it known with certainty who\r\ninvented the steam-engine, who invented the aniline dyes, or photography,\r\neven? Different nations are at variance on these points, as formerly\r\nthey were on the birthplace of Homer. The fact is, that the majority of\r\ninventions are due to the combined working [_collaboration_] of many men\r\nseparated by space, separated by great intervals of time.\r\n\r\nOn this subject M. Michel Chevalier repeats what he heard from an eminent\r\nman who was Minister of Finance at the time when Daguerre received the\r\nnational recompense which had been awarded him with the acclamations\r\nof all France. One of the Government clerks brought to this eminent\r\npersonage proof that he too had made the same invention; and also there\r\nwere the labours of M. Niepce de Saint Victor, analogous to those of M.\r\nDaguerre.\r\n\r\n[M. Passy, the chairman of the meeting, confirmed the statement of M.\r\nMichel Chevalier on this fact.]\r\n\r\nM. Michel Chevalier, in continuation, remarked that in our time\r\nindustrial arts are subject to great changes in the details of their\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nIndependently of the general alterations which from time to time\r\ncompletely change the face of any given manufacture, there is no\r\nimportant workshop where some useful notion is not occasionally suggested\r\nby some mechanic or overseer, which leads to minor improvements [_un\r\nperfectionnement de détail_]. It would be an abuse to grant, during a\r\nterm of fifteen years, or even a much shorter, exclusive use of any\r\nparticular improvements to any single individual. It would not be just,\r\nfor it is quite possible that the idea might have occurred to another\r\nat the same time, or that it might occur the next day. It would even be\r\nagainst the general interest, for it would fetter competition, which is\r\nthe chief motor in the progress of the useful arts.\r\n\r\nBut it is said inventors are useful to society; we must therefore\r\nrecompense them. To this M. Michel Chevalier answers that it may be\r\ntoo liberal to confer the flattering title of inventor on men who,\r\nwhen a veritable discovery has been made by _savants_, push themselves\r\nforward to appropriate the profits, in securing by Patents the various\r\nspecial applications which may be made of it. Besides, there are\r\ndifferent sorts of recompenses; there are other than material rewards,\r\nand these are not the least coveted. The _savants_ who are the greatest\r\ndiscoverers are satisfied with these immaterial rewards—honour, glory,\r\nand reputation. The example is worthy of recommendation; not but it is\r\nquite allowable for a man to extract from his labour [_travaux_] whatever\r\nmaterial recompense he can. But, in many cases at least, the Patent is\r\nnot necessary for this purpose. The authors of some useful discovery\r\nwould often have the resource of keeping their secret and working the\r\ninvention themselves. That would last for a time. Even under the system\r\nof Patents several inventors have thus sought and found an adequate\r\nremuneration.\r\n\r\nThus the famous Prussian steel manufacturer, M. Krupp, has taken out no\r\nPatent, and yet has made a colossal fortune; also M. Guimet, of Lyons,\r\ninventor of French blue. Their secret remained in their own hands for\r\nmore than fifteen years, the maximum duration that their Patent would\r\nhave had in France.\r\n\r\nLastly, in the case of some truly great discovery it would be natural to\r\naward a national recompense to the inventor. If James Watt, for instance,\r\nhad received from the British Parliament a handsome sum, every one would\r\nhave applauded it. These rewards would not impoverish the Treasury, since\r\nsimilar cases are of rare occurrence.\r\n\r\nIn recapitulation, Patent-right may have been allowable in the pasts\r\nwhen science and manufactures had not yet formed so close and intimate\r\na union. It was advisable to attract towards manufactures, by means of\r\nexceptional inducements, the attention of those who made a study of the\r\nsciences. But now that the union is consummated, Patent-right has ceased\r\nto be a useful auxiliary to industry. It is become, instead, a cause\r\nof embarrassment and an obstruction to progress. The time is come to\r\nrenounce it.\r\n\r\nAnother speaker at the meeting, M. PAUL COQ, thought that, on a question\r\nso delicate and controverted history furnishes instruction which directs\r\nto a right solution. Notably Franklin, a genius eminently practical,\r\ndeclared himself unwilling to avail himself, as to his numerous\r\ndiscoveries, of any Patent. The refusal of this great man is founded upon\r\nthe principle that every one receives during his whole life ideas and\r\ndiscoveries from the common fund of knowledge by which all profit, and\r\ntherefore ought, by reciprocation, to let the public freely benefit by\r\nevery invention of his. This, with Franklin, was not a mere sentimental\r\ntruth, but a practical conviction, based upon reasons worthy of the\r\nauthor of “Poor Richard.” There is in the bosom of society a constant\r\nexchange of beneficial thoughts and services. Every one stimulated by the\r\nefforts of others ought, in the spirit of equity, to make the community\r\nparticipants of the improvements and useful applications for which he\r\nhas in a manner received payment in advance. On this system, equality,\r\ncompetition, and freedom of industry find their account in the law of\r\nreciprocity; whereas, on the footing of privilege established and defined\r\nby the theory of Patents, there is created an artificial property, along\r\nside of that rightful property which has in it nothing arbitrary or\r\nconventional, and depends simply for its existence on civil law. These\r\ncircles, thereby traced round the inventor and his discovery, are so many\r\nhindrances and so many obstacles to the expansion of forces, in the way\r\nof continuous progress. Under pretext of maintaining individual rights,\r\nimprovement is in reality paralysed by superimposed difficulties, and\r\nespecially litigation without end, on account of which nobody dare touch,\r\neither far or near, what has been appropriated. The numerous actions\r\nat law, raised with a view to ascertain whether such and such a process\r\nconstitutes a perfectionation, a new application, or merely an imitation,\r\nare my proof. There is another proof in the distinction attempted to be\r\nmade between matters patentable and methods scientific which may not be\r\npatented. All this, as it affects progress, the free expansion of forces,\r\nis infinitely grave. Franklin has found for his precepts, already alluded\r\nto, more than one adept pupil. One modest _savant_, whose name deserves\r\nto be better known among us for his numerous services rendered to science\r\nas well as to the arts—Conté—honoured to replace in France the pencils\r\nof England, the importation of which was not possible in time of war—not\r\nonly supplied by his new process the want of plumbago with success, but\r\nmade it better than the English. To him are due, besides black-lead\r\npencils, which make his name celebrated, the crayons of various colours,\r\nwhich have been so serviceable in the arts of design. Well, like\r\nFranklin, he presented his process to industry, and contented himself\r\nwith being first in the new manufacture. It must be remarked that he who\r\nthus opens the way easily maintains the first rank which the date of his\r\ninvention assigns him, and which public confidence assures him....\r\n\r\nBefore concluding, M. Paul Coq adverted to the distinction between\r\nthe right of property generated by a creation of a work of art or of\r\nliterature, and factitious property decreed in the interests of industry.\r\nThe skilful painter, who should copy faithfully line for line, tint for\r\ntint, a _chef d’œuvre_ like the picture of Ingres, which every one knows,\r\n“The Source,” in order to expose it for sale and pocket the advantages,\r\nnot merely lays hold of the property of a great artist who lives by the\r\nfruit of his talent, but perpetrates, in all points of view, an action\r\nmean and vile. To inventions in the domain of the useful arts, processes\r\nand operations do not carry the stamp of personality, which is the glory\r\nof the artist and author, and which of itself constitutes a protection\r\nequal to that which protects right of property.\r\n\r\nThe invention is something _impersonal_, like a service rendered and\r\nreturned, which is not exchanged or paid by services of equivalent\r\nweight and description. There is, therefore, no plausible objection\r\nto maintaining unimpaired the common right, which, by its freedom of\r\nmovements, its equality, and its reciprocations, alone efficaciously\r\nfavours the result of which these are the indispensable corollaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIENCE IN FRANCE.\r\n\r\n_The following observations were published in the AVENIR COMMERCIAL,\r\nNovember 1, 1862, and June 28, 1863, have been kindly translated and\r\npresented by the Author_:—\r\n\r\nTHE RESULTS OF A BAD LAW.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nWhen you walk along a public road, if you find a watch, a diamond, a\r\nnote of a hundred or a thousand francs, and, far from seeking the owner\r\nto give it back, you apply it to your own use, moral law and civil law\r\ntake hold of you and condemn you without hesitation. It matters not\r\nwhether he who lost what you found be rich or poor, his carelessness, his\r\nnegligence, or the accident that caused his loss, give you no sort of\r\nright to use it and make it yours.\r\n\r\nThere are not two opinions on that point: the laws of all countries\r\ncondemn the man who enriches himself with what chance throws in his way.\r\n\r\nBut if a scientific man—seeking some impossible discovery, finds a clue\r\nto an idea—meets with an interesting phenomenon—indicates, in some way,\r\nnew properties belonging to some bodies—announces the results of some new\r\nchemical combination—it is only a scientific research. This or that other\r\nskimmer of inventions can get a Patent for the application of the idea,\r\nof the discovery, of the method; and the law guarantees his pretended\r\nright not only against all reclamations of the scientific man who has\r\ndiscovered the whole, but against the whole world, deprived of all\r\npossibility of making use of the discoveries of science!\r\n\r\nAnd not only the law forbids every one to use this or that produce,\r\nexcept if made by the patentee, but it also prohibits the use of any\r\nsimilar produce made by different means.\r\n\r\nThen, to prevent all inventors to approach the ground that the patentee\r\nhas chosen, he takes immense care to have his Patent made of formulas so\r\nwide and elastic, that all inventions in the same course of ideas will be\r\ninfringements in the eye of the law.\r\n\r\nTo these observations it is answered that industrialists or scientific\r\nmen are equal before the law, that all have an equal right to its\r\nprotection, but on the express condition that the invention be put in use.\r\n\r\nWe see very well where is the privilege of the chance patentee, who has\r\nmade the discovery of the scientific man his own, but we do not see where\r\nis its justice or equality.\r\n\r\nWe see very well where is the privilege of the man who has had nothing to\r\ndo but to apply the idea deposited in a book by a scientific man—an idea\r\nthat, in fact, was at the disposal of the public, since the discoverer\r\ndid not claim its proprietorship; but we do not see why the law gives a\r\nmonopoly to him who has only borrowed that idea.\r\n\r\nBut we are told, the law is quite equitable, for it, says, “To every man\r\nhis due. The scientific man discovers a body, glory be to him. If he\r\nwill add to it some profit, let him indicate the properties that may be\r\nused industrially, and let him take a Patent for his discovery. But he\r\nmust hurry, because if industry forestalls him, industry will get the\r\nprofit.”[6] It is exactly as if this was the law: A millionaire drops a\r\n100-franc note. It will not make him much poorer. If he wants to get it\r\nback, let him return where he came from and seek along the road. Let him\r\nhurry, for if this note is found, he who will have got it may keep it.\r\n\r\nCommon sense and equity would join to say that when a scientific man\r\nindicates a discovery or an invention, that invention or discovery\r\nremains at the disposal of every one if the finder does not claim the\r\nexclusive right to work it. But the law is different, and the results are\r\nsoon made apparent.\r\n\r\nIn 1856 an English chemist, of the name of Perkins, was seeking the\r\nway to make artificial quinine. In the course of his experiments he\r\ndiscovered in the laboratory of M. Hofmann the property residing in\r\naniline of producing a violet colour by the action of bi-chromate of\r\npotass.\r\n\r\nPerkins got a Patent for this discovery. The attention of the scientific\r\nand industrial classes being called to this property of aniline, and to\r\nthe possibility of extracting from it divers colouring matters, several\r\nFrench and other chemists and manufacturers got Patents for many more new\r\nprocesses.\r\n\r\nIn 1858, Hofmann, continuing to study aniline, discovered the red colour.\r\nHe sent a memoir to our Académie des Sciences, in which he gave the exact\r\nmethod to produce this magnificent crimson red.\r\n\r\nHofmann took no Patent; it seemed as if he wanted to present gratuitously\r\nto tinctorial industry a new and beautiful produce.\r\n\r\nSix months after, a manufacturer, who as early as 1857 had tried to\r\nget patented in France the patented discovery of Perkins, sold to a\r\nmanufacturer of chemical produce a process copied from the discovery\r\nof Hofmann, by which the red of aniline could be manufactured by the\r\nreaction of the bi-chloride of tin. The Patent was granted, and the\r\nproduce manufactured. But very soon after, in France and abroad, more\r\nadvantageous and more scientific methods, preferable to the patented one,\r\nwere found.\r\n\r\nAll the French manufacturers who tried to use any of these new processes\r\nwere prosecuted and condemned for infringement on the right of the\r\npatentee. It then followed that one kilogramme of red of aniline was sold\r\nabroad for £12, and the monopolisers sold it for £40 in France.\r\n\r\nThis could not last, particularly after the treaty of commerce, by which\r\nprinted and dyed goods could be introduced. Manufacturers threatened to\r\ngive up work, and the patentee thought proper to reduce his prices.\r\n\r\nBut another result, no less fatal to French interests, soon followed.\r\n\r\nThe most intelligent manufacturers of colouring-stuffs, those who were\r\nat the head of that branch of industry, and had concentrated in Paris,\r\nLyons, and Mulhouse the fabrication of the finest and most delicate dyes\r\nfor the home and foreign market, went to establish new factories across\r\nthe frontiers.\r\n\r\nThe existing Patent prevented them from satisfying the demands of their\r\ncustomers abroad, who required some aniline colours, and they were\r\nobliged to carry their industry to foreign parts.\r\n\r\nThe following is the list of the manufacturers who have founded new\r\nestablishments beyond the reach of the monopolising Patent:—\r\n\r\nA. Schlumberger, of Mulhouse, new factory at Bâle (Switzerland); Jean\r\nFeer, of Strasburg, new factory at Bâle; Peterson and Seikler, of Saint\r\nDenis, new factory at Bâle; Poirrier and Chappal, of Paris, new factory\r\nat Zurich; Monnet and Dury, of Lyons, new factory at Geneve.\r\n\r\nFive other establishments, raised by Swiss people but under the direction\r\nof Frenchmen, are being founded at Bâle, Zurich, Glaris, and Saint Gall.\r\nThen there are still to be founded, the factory of M. A. Wurtz, brother\r\nto Professor Wurtz at Leipsic; another, by M. O. Meister at Chemnitz; a\r\nFrench factory at Elberfeld; three, also French, in Belgium; and three\r\nothers in Switzerland.\r\n\r\nIt is, in fact, a general expatriation, like the one that followed the\r\nrevocation of the Edict of Nantes. It is worthy of remark that in Germany\r\nthere are twelve Patents for making colours or dyes from aniline; in\r\nEngland there are fourteen, in France (thanks to the interpretation given\r\nto the law) there is _one_. “_Et nunc caveant consules._”\r\n\r\n                                                             T. N. BENARD.\r\n\r\n[6] Extract of a paper on the subject in the _Propriété Industrielle_.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nIn our number of November 1, 1862, we published on this very same\r\nquestion an article in which we stated that about twenty French\r\nmanufacturers had been forced to go abroad to escape the unheard-of\r\nexigencies of the law of Patents. We were answered by insults that we\r\ndisdained; but the facts that we had revealed were not contested.\r\n\r\nA volume just published on the legislation and the jurisprudence of the\r\nlaw of Patents enables us to show another side of the question, and\r\nto prove how injurious it is to manufacturers and inventors, and how\r\nprofitable to certain gentlemen of the Bar who have the speciality of\r\ncases for infringement on Patents. We say it openly and fearlessly, if\r\nit was not for the lawyers who swim freely amongst the windings of that\r\nlaw, it would not have a supporter. Manufacturers and inventors are\r\nshamelessly made a prey to a group of pleaders who defend right and wrong\r\nwith the same deplorable alacrity.\r\n\r\nWhat an immense number of law-suits have arisen from the 54 articles of\r\nthat law! The volume we have in hand has been written with the intention\r\nof giving to the public a view of the jurisprudence adopted by the Courts\r\nin the interpretation of each paragraph. A summary of the trials that\r\nhave taken place since its promulgation in 1844 follows each article of\r\nthe law.\r\n\r\nArticle I. is as follows: “Every new discovery or invention, in all kinds\r\nof industry, ensures to its author, under the conditions and for the\r\ntime hereafter determined, the exclusive right to work for his benefit\r\nthe said discovery or invention. This right is established by documents\r\ngranted by the Government, and called Patents.”\r\n\r\nThe first trial that we find in the list took place in 1844. The question\r\nwas, Whether the words _all kinds of industry_ could be applied to things\r\nthat are not in trade? The Court’s decision was for the affirmative.\r\n\r\nThe second trial was raised to know if, when a working man is only\r\nexecuting the orders given to him by another party, with the indications\r\nand in the interest of this last, the working man may be reputed the\r\ninventor, and if the results of his labour may have the character of an\r\ninvention, so that he may claim [revendicate] its ownership by a Patent.\r\nThe Court decided for the negative.\r\n\r\nWe pass four other suits running on the interpretation of this first\r\narticle, that seems so innocent, so inoffensive, and come to the\r\neleventh trial. In conferring by Article I., under the conditions that\r\nit determines, on the author of new discoveries or inventions the right\r\nof working them exclusively for his own benefit, did the law intend to\r\ndeprive of all rights those who were using the same means of fabrication\r\nprior to the delivery of the Patents? The question was, in other terms,\r\nto know whether the Patent is good and legal against every one except\r\nagainst the party who, having worked it for a certain period anterior to\r\nthe granting of the Patent, might be kept in possession of his industry?\r\nOn March 30, 1849, the Court of Cassation decided for the affirmative in\r\nthe case of “Witz Meunier _versus_ Godefroy Muller.” You fancy, perhaps,\r\nthat the affair is all right and settled; the Court of Cassation has\r\nspoken, and every inventor who will not have taken a Patent may work out\r\nhis invention without fear of prosecution from a patentee coming long\r\nafter. You are greatly mistaken. You do not know how keen, and ardent,\r\nand clever, and anxious are the seekers of Patents. Previously to that\r\nthe Court Royal of Paris had declared in May, 1847, in the case of\r\n“Lejeune _versus_ Parvilley,” that the Patent can be put in force against\r\nthe manufacturer working the invention before it was patented, if he has\r\nnot published it before the patentee, and if the patentee is the first\r\nwho has introduced it in commerce. But in 1847 the Court Royal of Paris\r\ndid not know the opinion given in 1849 by the Court of Cassation. We see\r\nhow unsafe are the things of this world. Say if you can ever be sure of\r\nholding and knowing the truth.\r\n\r\nOn August 19, 1853, the same question was brought again before the\r\nCourt of Cassation in the case of “Thomas Laurent _versus_ Riant,” and\r\nthe Court decided that the Patent can be put in force against whoever\r\npossessed the invention before it was patented. There is at Lyons a\r\nmanufacturer who for a great many years fabricated a dye for which he\r\nhas not taken a Patent, but the secret of which he carefully keeps to\r\nhimself. If, by some manœuvring, by some doubtfully moral means, an\r\nindustrialist—as there are too many amongst the patentees—contrived\r\nto worm out this secret, and got a legal Patent, he could work the\r\ndiscovery and oblige the Lyonese manufacturer to cease all productions\r\nof the same kind. Would it not be an admirable example of legality?\r\n\r\nThe contradiction that we have just noted between two verdicts given by\r\nthe same Court upon the same question gives us the right to say that the\r\nmagistrates ought to show a little more indulgence to those they condemn.\r\nWhen there is a law like that relative to Patents, common mortals are\r\nvery excusable if they make a mistake in interpreting in a wrong way this\r\nor that expression, since we see the highest Court in the country giving\r\nsometimes one interpretation and sometimes another.\r\n\r\nThe first article of the law has given rise to fifteen different suits,\r\ninscribed in the pages of the volume we hold. These fifteen suits have\r\nbeen tried before the Civil Courts or the Court of Cassation. People may\r\nwell be frightened at the mountain of papers that must have been used and\r\ndestroyed by the attorneys, counsel, barristers, &c., before the public\r\ncould have any clear notion of what the legislators meant.\r\n\r\nThe second article is as follows: “Will be considered as new inventions\r\nor discoveries—the invention of new industrial produce; the invention\r\nof new methods or the new application of known methods to obtain an\r\nindividual result or produce.” This article, we may say, is the main beam\r\nof the edifice, consequently it has given occasion to no less than 104\r\nsuits. One might fancy that the multitude of judicial decisions given by\r\nthe Courts has thrown the most brilliant light on the interpretation to\r\nbe given to the three paragraphs forming the second article. Alas! these\r\nparagraphs are just as obscure as before. For instance, the Imperial\r\nCourt of Paris decided on August 13, 1861, that the “change in the form\r\nof a surgical instrument, even when there may result an advantage or\r\ngreater facility to the operator, cannot be patented.” But on July 26 of\r\nthe same year it had decided that “a production already known—a straw\r\nmat, for instance—may be patented when its form, its size, and its length\r\nare new.” So, again, the Court of Cassation decided, on February 9, 1862,\r\nthat “the production of a new industrial result is an invention that may\r\nbe patented, even if it is only due to a new combination in the form and\r\nproportions of objects already known.” On the contrary, the Correctional\r\nCourt of the Seine decided on December 24, 1861, that a modification\r\nof form, even when it procures an advantage, is not of a nature to\r\nconstitute a patentable invention. Can we not say with the poet:\r\n\r\n    “Deviner si tu peux, et choisis si tu l’oses?”\r\n\r\nThe lawyers of Great Britain are accustomed to celebrate certain\r\nanniversaries by a professional dinner. The President of the party, after\r\nhaving proposed the health of the Queen and the Royal Family, calls upon\r\nhis brethren to join in a toast to the prosperity of the profession\r\nthey follow. This traditional toast is characteristic enough. It is as\r\nfollows: “_The glorious uncertainty of the law!_” We think the facts we\r\nhave related give to this toast a right of citizenship on this side of\r\nthe Channel.\r\n\r\n                                                             T. N. BENARD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT MESSAGE FROM THE SECRETARY OF THE CONFEDERATION, COUNT VON\r\nBISMARCK, TO THE NORTH GERMAN FEDERAL PARLIAMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                Berlin, December 10, 1868.\r\n\r\nIn the presence of the manifold and well-founded complaints concerning\r\nthe defective state of legislation on Patents in Prussia and Germany, the\r\nRoyal Prussian Government deems it important to have considered without\r\nany further delay what course might best be adopted in the matter.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, however, and with a view to the position long since\r\ntaken by Government in regard to the question, it must not be omitted in\r\nthe first place to decide whether henceforth Patents should be granted\r\nat all within the boundaries of the Confederation. The frequent polemics\r\non the principles of Patent-Laws, to which the repeated attempts at\r\nreform have given birth during the last ten years, and more particularly\r\nthe discussions in the late German Federal Assembly, have enhanced the\r\nquestionability of the usefulness of Patents.\r\n\r\nAfter taking the opinion of the Chambers of Commerce and the mercantile\r\ncorporations, the Prussian Government, on the occasion of the German\r\nFederal Assembly Session of 31st December, 1863, gave utterance to the\r\ndoubt whether under present circumstances, Patents for inventions may\r\nbe considered either necessary or useful to industry. Since then the\r\nRoyal Prussian Government has taken the question once more into serious\r\nconsideration, and feels bound to answer it in the negative on the\r\nstrength of the following arguments.\r\n\r\nFrom a theoretical point of view, it may be taken for granted that the\r\nconferring of an exclusive right to profits which may be derived from\r\nindustrial inventions, is neither warranted by a natural claim on the\r\npart of the inventor which should be protected by the State, nor is it\r\nconsequent upon general economical principles.\r\n\r\nThe right of prohibiting others from using certain industrial inventions,\r\nor bringing certain resources and profitable means of production into\r\noperation, constitutes an attack upon the inalienable right which every\r\nman has, of applying each and every lawful advantage to the exercise of\r\nhis profession, which is the more obvious, as there exists a prevailing\r\ntendency to free industrial pursuits from all artificial restrictions\r\nadherent to them, and the time-honoured practice can only be upheld by\r\na thorough vindication and a practical proof of its fully answering the\r\npurpose. To demonstrate this should be the chief aim of all arguments\r\nagainst abolition.\r\n\r\nTo an argument which has repeatedly been urged—_i.e._, that the granting\r\na temporary exclusive right is indispensable (so as to secure for the\r\nmeritorious inventor a reward adequate to the mental labour and money\r\nexpended, as well as risk incurred, in order that there be no lack of\r\nencouragement to the inventive genius)—the objection may be raised\r\nthat the remarkably developed system of communication and conveyance\r\nnow-a-days, which has opened a wide field to real merit, and enables\r\nindustrial men promptly to reap all benefit of production by means of\r\nenlarged outlets for their articles, will, generally speaking, bring\r\nthose who know how to avail themselves before others of useful inventions\r\nto such an extent ahead of their competitors, that, even where no\r\npermanent privilege is longer admissible, they will make sure of a\r\ntemporary extra profit, in proportion to the service rendered to the\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nIt is, in fact, in the peculiar advantage produced by the early\r\nbringing into operation of a fresh suggestion of their minds, that the\r\nremuneration of those lies, who, through cleverness and steadiness of\r\npurpose, succeed in satisfying existing wants in a manner less expensive\r\nand superior to what previously was the case, and notwithstanding do not\r\nobtain any monopoly. Not of less account are the practical impediments\r\nwhich stand in the way of every effort to bring about an improvement of\r\nthe Patent-Law.\r\n\r\nIt is generally admitted by the promoters of Patent-right, that the\r\nsystem of inquiry or examination, as it is now working in Prussia, cannot\r\npossibly remain in its present condition, and the experienced officers\r\nappointed to decide upon Patent matters and make the necessary inquiries,\r\nunanimously confirm that opinion. Though provided with relatively\r\nexcellent means of ascertaining, the Prussian Technical Committee for\r\nIndustry had to acknowledge as early as 1853 (_Vide_ Prussian Trade\r\nArchives of 1854, Vol. ii., page 173, ff.) that the question whether\r\nan invention submitted for being patented might not perchance already\r\nhave been made or brought into operation elsewhere, was almost an\r\nunsolvable one. Since then, inventions have augmented yearly in steadily\r\nincreasing proportion. The main difficulty, however, not only rests\r\nin the impossibility of mastering the matter submitted, but equally\r\nso with the upholding of firm principles relating to the criterion of\r\noriginality. If the inquiry do not altogether deviate from its primitive\r\nobject by patenting any and every innovation in construction, form,\r\nor execution, which is presented, we fall into such uncertainty when\r\nsifting actual inventions from the mass of things which are not to be\r\nconsidered as undeniable improvements—owing to the continually increasing\r\nand diversified combinations of generally known elements or material and\r\naltered constructions or modes of application—that it is hardly possible\r\nnot to be occasionally chargeable with injustice. Every day shows more\r\nclearly how annoying a responsibility grows out of such a state of\r\naffairs, and it is highly desirable that the authorities no longer be\r\nconscious of doing injustice in their duties on account of rules which\r\ncannot properly be put into practice.\r\n\r\nAs for the often much-commended so-called “application system,” it\r\nwould by no means really answer the purpose; even without considering\r\nthe theoretical objections which might be raised against it. Its\r\npractical results have been far from giving satisfaction wherever it\r\nhas been adopted. The complaints of the abuses and impediments industry\r\nsuffers under, and which are brought about through the overwhelming\r\nmass of Patents, for the most part taken out with a view to swindling\r\nspeculation, the unpleasant experience acquired by those who take all\r\nlegal means so as subsequently to contest and defend Patents granted\r\nwithout previous inquiry being made, have led to a reaction of public\r\nopinion in favour of abolishing the system.\r\n\r\nThe unsatisfactory and quite abnormal state of all matters connected with\r\nPatents in England and France had, years ago, claimed the most earnest\r\nattention of the legislators, and led to practical deliberations on the\r\nnecessity and the means of effective improvements. The French Government\r\nintroduced a Bill in 1858, to the effect that the hearing of objections\r\nto Patents applied for might, as much as possible, take place previous\r\nto the same being granted. A similar system which is in force in England\r\nhas, however, proved inadequate in that country, and the commission\r\nwhich, in 1863, made a detailed statement as to the merits of the\r\nexisting Patent-Law, recommended the adoption of official inquiry.\r\n\r\nUnder the circumstances, it can hardly be the question at all, for the\r\nNorth German Confederation, to admit of the mere “application system.”\r\nNor can the imposition of high taxes [on patentees?] (not taking\r\ninto account their inconsistency with the real object of Patents) be\r\nconsidered a sufficient corrective of the system, after the experience\r\nacquired in England on this head.\r\n\r\nBoth the inquiry and application systems having proved defective, the\r\nconclusion is arrived at, that the difficulties cannot be overcome\r\nby means of altering certain details in the institution, but rather\r\narise out of constitutional infirmities of the institution itself. The\r\nPatent system makes such distinctions necessary as are now practically\r\ninadmissible, and the impracticability of which is by no means removed\r\nthrough merely transferring the evil from one side to the other. It\r\nmust be granted that if artificial contrivances be at all required to\r\nadequately remunerate an inventor for the services rendered to society,\r\nthey cannot be hit upon in this direction without hurting all important\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\nThat the final step of repealing Patents altogether should not yet have\r\nbeen taken anywhere, in spite of the leading theoretical and practical\r\nauthorities having urged it, may be easily explained by the fact that we\r\nhave to deal with an institution which very long ago has taken root in\r\nthe usage of the industrial nations, and to which tradition ascribes most\r\nof the immense progress industry has taken during its existence. To this\r\nmay be added the apprehension lest the country which would take the lead\r\nin the matter might find itself at a disadvantage with the remainder.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, the anticipation of a profitable use to be made of an\r\ninvention for one’s exclusive benefit is, no doubt, a powerful incitement\r\nfor the inventive genius, and equally is it admitted that to temporary\r\nPatent-right we owe the successive improvements on many a useful\r\ninvention.\r\n\r\nExperience has, however, taught that in most instances Patents do not\r\nfulfil their mission; that on the whole they have not proved an actual\r\nbenefit, either to the proprietor or the public; that the profits have\r\ngone just as often into the pockets of strangers as into those of the\r\nable inventor. When chiefly ascribing the progress made by industry\r\nthrough technical improvements in many of the countries where extensive\r\nregulations of Patent-right are provided, to the incitement consequent\r\nupon the protection afforded by Patents, the fact is overlooked that\r\nthe great inventions made in old times, as well as the scientific\r\ndiscoveries which in the modern era paved the way for industry, have\r\nperfectly done without any such incitements. Against the stimulating\r\ninfluence of monopoly upon individuals, we must, however, in a period\r\nso extremely favourable to industrial progress, not underrate the very\r\nimportant point, that it also checks the quick and fertile development\r\nof a new thought, which, when totally free, might be expected to spring\r\nup in a higher degree from the competing labours of all. Of course, it\r\nis impossible to say whether in England, Belgium, France, and the United\r\nStates, industry, if supported by other favourable stipulations, might\r\nnot have taken an equal development without the protection of Patents;\r\nbut we have at all events an illustration of this being the fact in\r\nSwitzerland, where the absence of Patents has not at all been found\r\nprejudicial to the public at large. The records of the latter country\r\nmay dispel all apprehension lest the abolition of Patents should place\r\nnational industry on an unequal and disadvantageous footing with foreign.\r\nIf Germany be foremost in the indicated direction, we must, it is true,\r\nbe alive to the very likely occurrence of her standing, at least for\r\nsome time to come, isolated on her platform. A favourable result of the\r\nmovement in either England or France can hardly be looked for at a very\r\nearly date, considering the state of public opinion prevailing in those\r\ncountries, as well as the large individual interests at stake, owing to\r\nthe wide scope for protection arising out of their Patent system, while\r\nat the same time it is yet a fact worthy of remark, that neither England\r\nnor France have been able to make up their minds as to reforming a system\r\nthe numerous defects of which are universally recognised. In Germany\r\nthe same difficulties do not present themselves to the same extent, the\r\nless prolixity of our Patent institution not affecting the industrial\r\npart of the nation in nearly the same ratio. The whole system in this\r\ncountry has been less active in all directions; proof of this is given by\r\nthe statistics of Patents, as compared with those taken out abroad. The\r\nactual items in 1867 were as follows:—\r\n\r\n    For Prussia                 103 Patents.\r\n     ”  Saxony                  179    ”\r\n     ”  the Thuringian Union     33    ”\r\n     ”  Brunswick                32    ”\r\n     ”  Hesse                    20    ”\r\n     ”  Oldenburg                12    ”\r\n     ”  Bavaria                 214    ”\r\n     ”  Würtemberg              139    ”\r\n     ”  Baden                    46    ”\r\n\r\nWhereas, in 1866, there were granted—\r\n\r\n    In England (including the provisional protections)  3,453\r\n    In France                                     about 4,400\r\n    In Belgium                                      ”   1,700\r\n    And in the United States                        ”   9,450\r\n\r\nIn Prussia, on account of the rigidly adhered-to preliminary inquiry,\r\n87 per cent. on an average of the Patents applied for during the last\r\nten years have been non-suited, and only from 50 to 100 requests a year\r\nwere granted. Besides, it is scarcely subject to a doubt that even of\r\nthese only a small number has been turned to practical use. Again, the\r\namount of privilege the Patent ensures is less in Germany than abroad,\r\nas in conformity with the clauses of the Treaty of 21st September, 1842\r\n(and which provisions should be kept in force under any circumstances),\r\na Patent does not confer upon its proprietor (not taking into view\r\nmachinery or instruments) a prohibitory right against the importation,\r\nsale, or consumption of foreign articles.[7]\r\n\r\nThe anticipation that the abolition of Patents might cause the results of\r\nnew inventions to be lost to the nation through the respective inventors\r\nturning themselves towards the protection-affording countries, is not\r\nconfirmed by the experience acquired on this head in Switzerland. The\r\nindustrial who has invented a new process will, in most instances, be\r\ninfluenced by other motives to bring the same into operation where\r\nhe has his factory and his already acquired customers. Nor can much\r\nimportance be attached to the apprehension that, should the Patent-Law\r\nbe repealed, inventors might show more disposition towards keeping new\r\ninventions secret from the public; for, even assuming the abolition to\r\nbe an incitement to keeping inventions secret, yet it cannot be admitted\r\nthat any prejudicial change from the present state of things would take\r\nplace. Even now, under the rule of the Patent-Law, it is a recognised\r\nfact, that to such methods of fabrication and resources as admit of being\r\nkept secret, the very secrecy affords ampler protection than the Patent\r\nitself. By thus drawing the conclusion that those inventions which might\r\neventually be kept secret are so at the present time as well, no actual\r\nprejudice will be caused by one measure being in force rather than the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Prussian Government, therefore, thinks that by completely\r\nabolishing the Patent system within the limits of the Confederation (a\r\nresolution recommended by economical theory, and which public opinion\r\nhas been sufficiently prepared for), instead of making any further and\r\nnecessarily unsuccessful attempts at reform, the circumstance of the\r\nConfederation preceding other important industrial nations cannot be\r\nconsidered an actual impediment, although it would be far preferable that\r\nthe South-German States should join in the measure, so as to extend the\r\ninnovation to all countries comprised in the Zollverein.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned is of opinion that previous to further inquiring into\r\nthe particulars of the Patent-Law, the North German Confederation\r\nought first of all to decide whether henceforth any protection by means\r\nof Patents should be afforded at all within the boundaries of the\r\nConfederation. Assuming this, and also considering that the Confederation\r\nshall have to take a decision as to the attempts at reform, the\r\nundersigned moves: “That the Federal Parliament appoint the Committee on\r\ntrade and intercourse, to deliberate on the question proposed, and report\r\non the same.\r\n\r\n                                 (Signed)\r\n\r\n                                                           “VON BISMARCK.”\r\n\r\n[7] This mighty difference from our British practice is in harmony with\r\nwhat I have shown is the scope of the original English Act, and with our\r\ncommon law.—R. A. M.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPOSITION FOR THE ABOLITION OF PATENTS IN HOLLAND.\r\n\r\nSECOND CHAMBER OF THE NETHERLANDS LEGISLATURE, SESSION OF 21st JUNE,\r\n1869.—DISCUSSION ON THE ABOLITION OF EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS IN INVENTIONS AND\r\nIMPROVEMENTS OF OBJECTS OF ART AND INDUSTRY—(PATENTS).\r\n\r\n\r\nM. VAN ZINNICQ BERGMANN was not sufficiently prepared for the discussion\r\nwhile the project was in Committee. He feels much sympathy for all such\r\nmeasures as tend to do away with impediments to trade and industry.\r\nAt the same time, people ought to discriminate between the kind of\r\nprotection which is a hindrance to industry, and may be called monopoly,\r\nand the one to which property is entitled on the part of the State.\r\n\r\nAt this part of his speech the hon. member indulges in extensive remarks\r\non the right of property. According to Roman law, the right of property\r\nwas a “_jus quod natura omnia animalia docuit_.” But that definition is\r\nnot a correct one, as the right of property is especially maintained in\r\ncivilised society.\r\n\r\nAfter that, the hon. member launches himself into allegory. Try, quoth\r\nhe, to drive the lion from his den; he will defend it until his last\r\ndrop of blood! Look at the boy who snatches the young and tender bird\r\nfrom its nest; the mother will pursue the robber, and not leave him.\r\nNow, he should like to know whether an artist, an inventor, an author,\r\nhas, or has not, a right of property in his work which entitles him to\r\nthe benefits to be derived from it? This question he answers in the\r\naffirmative, and refers to Soy, Massé, and the “Assemblée Constituante”\r\nof France in December, 1791. And why should there be no right of\r\nproperty? Perhaps on account of an article in the Civil Code, which\r\nsays, “_possession vaut titre_,” or of a restriction to a greater or\r\nsmaller lapse of time? We are continually referred to England and the\r\nUnited States. But what is England? England is a country at the same\r\ntime emancipated and in course of emancipation. Duly considered, England\r\nwill be found to be, internally, in about the same state in which\r\nthe Netherlands were before 1795, or before the end of the sixteenth\r\ncentury—(laughter)—but, the hon. member adds, always accompanied by such\r\nimprovements as rulers have successively granted with regard to Patents.\r\nEngland may have had its commotions; but, nevertheless, charters have\r\nnever been otherwise but granted, and the privileges, exacted though they\r\nmay have been, were received at the hands of the King. And what have we\r\nbeen doing? We expelled our Stadholder, and got annexed to France; the\r\nprinciples of 1798 have taken root in our country, and continue to be the\r\nbasis for present action. The hon. member further argues that Patents\r\nare granted to emancipated slaves, but free citizens take out “brévets\r\nd’invention.” He is of opinion that it is a wrong impression that Patents\r\nare to be placed upon a line with the abolition of guilds. There is no\r\nconnexion whatever between these institutions, and this he demonstrates\r\nby reference to French authors. Even taking Michel Chevalier’s doctrines\r\nfor granted, he asks, “Could such difficulties not be obviated through\r\na _reform_ of the Patent-Law?” Once at a time, Alexander made himself\r\nfamous by cutting through the Gordian knot. That was a despot’s doing;\r\nhe might have deserved more fame had he succeeded in disentangling the\r\nknot. Such should be the final aim the legislator ought to strive to\r\nreach. Finally, the hon. member puts forward the question, whether the\r\npassing of the law now before the House might not involve the country in\r\ninternational troubles; for, Switzerland alone excepted, every country in\r\nEurope has its Patent-Law. Besides, we are aware that, as far as literary\r\nright of property is concerned, a neighbouring country has, against its\r\nwill, been compelled to maintain it. We, at our turn, might once have to\r\ncome back to what we want at present to repeal. Let us, therefore, be\r\ncautious.\r\n\r\nM. HEEMSKERK AZN remarks that continued allusions are being made to\r\nreaction. Generally speaking, such allusions are made out of personal\r\nmotives; but he should very much like to see a real live reactionist, who\r\nwould like to repeal what progress has brought us. There may possibly be\r\npeople extant who would wish to do so, but as for him, he is not aware\r\nof any reactionary plots against our institutions, or the effects of\r\nscience and progress; yet this very project now before the House, which\r\n_he_ considers to be _reaction_, has been most favourably received in\r\nCommittee. Should the Netherlands Legislature sanction it, _then_ he\r\nshall have to believe in the existence of reaction. For it is an easy\r\nthing to find evidence of reaction in the project under discussion.\r\nM. van Zinnicq Bergmann has already more or less demonstrated it. He\r\n(M. Heemskerk) will add a few more particulars. Where, the hon. member\r\nasks, lies the origin of Patents? In the cultivation of a free spirit,\r\nand the ennobling of labour; and of these, the right of protection\r\nexisted since time immemorial. Deviating from the civil rights, the\r\nStuarts, through favour or arbitrary motives, granted “privileges;” but\r\nthe Free Parliaments saved Patents, that protect inventions. Moreover,\r\nthis principle has been adopted in the most freedom-advocating of\r\nconstitutions—viz., that of the United States. The same may be said\r\nwith regard to France. On the 31st December, 1790, the “Assemblée\r\nConstituante” resolved that the right [of property] in inventions should\r\nbe guaranteed, and in this resolution originated the first French\r\nPatent-Law. The Netherlands would be the very first country on earth\r\n(with one exception only) to deviate from the principle of a right of\r\nproperty in inventions, in a moment, when public opinion, dissenting\r\nthereby from a few economists, everywhere declares in favour of Patents.\r\nHe reminds the House of the immense influence inventions have had on\r\nhistory and society, such as the invention of printing, of the compass,\r\nsteam, gas, &c. And would it be fair to withhold from those who promote\r\nprogress that protection which is legally due to them; whereas there\r\nis no end of provisions in the code protecting mere material property,\r\nsuch as the right of inheritance until the twelfth degree, lotteries,\r\nstock gambling, and the like? Government has evidently been aware of\r\nthe circumstances standing in the way of the project, as is proved by\r\npage 1 of the Memorial of Explanation; but it shrinks from the logical\r\nconsequences. The Patent system is based upon the principle that nobody\r\nshould enrich himself by another man’s property. This has also lately\r\nbeen argued at length in Savornel Lohman’s pamphlet. The hon. member\r\ngives it as his opinion that in this matter an author is in exactly\r\nthe same position as an inventor. If Patents be abolished, we shall\r\nlogically have to come to repealing Copyright as well. A counterfeited\r\nedition is nothing else than the imitation of an object of industry;\r\nthe writer is an author, but the inventor is no less an author. Amongst\r\nothers, he refers to a speech from Lamartine (as reporter of a Committee\r\nin the French Legislative Chambers, which consisted of the then most\r\neminent economists) on the Patent-Law of 1844, which is still in force.\r\nHe insists that the justice of his system of maintaining the right\r\nof property is proved beyond a doubt by the ever and again recurring\r\ncircumstance of an inventor lacking capital for a practical application\r\nof his lucubrations. Still, he often obtains the requisite means; and\r\nnow everybody will be enabled to imitate the result of his thoughts and\r\nlabour, and to reap the profits to accrue from the same. He points to\r\nProfessor Visvering’s work on practical economy, who also recognised\r\nthat, if no exclusive Patents be delivered, still inventors had a\r\nright to a remuneration of some kind. Those who oppose the Patent-Law\r\ncontend that an inventor is not entitled to a reward; he admits that\r\nno reward should be expected, but most assuredly the inventor may lay\r\nclaim to remuneration for the labour expended on the invention. We are\r\nreferred to Switzerland, where no Patents are given. But what of that?\r\nIn the first place, most of the industrial Cantons of Switzerland are\r\nclamorous for a Patent-Law; secondly, the Swiss, as a body, equally want\r\nthe measure to be put through; and, in the third place, the hon. member\r\npoints to the large benefits which, according to Klosterman’s recent\r\nwork, Swiss industrials derive from foreign Patent-Laws. It is alleged\r\nthat the number of Patents which are being delivered [in Holland] is but\r\nsmall. But, says M. Heemskerk, foreigners, on the contrary, claim that\r\nthe number is large. There exists apprehension of law-suits; but can\r\nthat be brought to bear upon the repeal of the Patent-Law? In that case,\r\nlanded property would be the least tolerable, as the proverb says—“_Qui\r\nterre a, guerre a._” Moreover, no three law-suits are known to have\r\nsprung up from Patents in this country since the law has been in force.\r\nIn Belgium, it is true, much action has of late been taken in order to\r\ndo away with Patents; but there, as well as in Prussia, the movement\r\nis rapidly decreasing. The hon. member refers to the “Nederlandsche\r\nIndustrieel,” a periodical which, though strenuously in favour of\r\nabolition of Patents, nevertheless mentions in its issues of 14th and\r\n21st of February, and 20th of June, what has lately occurred in this\r\nrespect in Germany and elsewhere. In Great Britain also the question has\r\nlately been discussed in Parliament, but the member who moved it did\r\nnot even take the votes upon it, but quietly dropped the matter; such\r\nwas the impression made upon his mind by the arguments brought forward\r\n[!]. The subject has equally engrossed the attention of the “Société\r\nEconomique” of Paris, when eminent economists, amongst whom Wolowski,\r\ndeclared in favour of Patents. This is mentioned in the _Economistes_ of\r\nJune [see page 164]. For all these reasons the hon. member recommends\r\nto the serious consideration of the House that, for the time being at\r\nleast, the rash Act be not consummated. Do not throw such a stain upon\r\nyour Legislature, he emphatically exclaims. Do not step backward; beware\r\nof relinquishing the protection of any description of property. Do not\r\ncripple the law by ignoring a principle which protects the fruit of human\r\nintellect. Beware of laying violent hands upon property, of whatever kind\r\nit may be. Let us do better than that; let us reject the bill. Persuade\r\nGovernment, there being no haste whatever, to propose to the Chambers\r\nthat the subject be deferred until next Session. At all events, nothing\r\nwould be lost by it. Meanwhile Government would be enabled to reconsider\r\nthe subject, and to make inquiries abroad as to the state of legislation\r\non this head. No prejudice would be occasioned by deferring the matter;\r\nfor the hon. member expresses his firm belief that a dangerous measure\r\nis about to be adopted with regard to a subject with which the utmost\r\ncaution should be observed.\r\n\r\nM. DE BRUYN KOPS would not enter into all particulars, the matter having\r\nbeen treated at length in the sundry documents relating to it; but he\r\nwould restrict himself to a refutation of M. Heemskerk’s arguments.\r\nHe is in a position to place himself on a very simple point of view.\r\nThe law of 1817 is generally disliked, in principle as well as in its\r\ndetails. It has been admitted that it does not give the inventor any\r\nguarantee, and this on the ground of the issue of some law-suits which\r\nhave sprung up from it. So Patents, far from giving a security, hinder\r\nthe general public and impede industry. It is a fact worthy of notice,\r\nthat the leading industrial organs, such as the Chambers of Commerce and\r\nFactories, the Industrial Society, the Union for Promoting Mechanical\r\nand Manual Industry, and the Nederlandsche Industrieel, unanimously have\r\ndeclared against Patents; so have a score of industrials. Are these not\r\nfacts worth more than a few considerations about a right to special\r\nprotection? Add to this the circumstance that in those countries where\r\nPatents do exist difficulties are gradually increasing; as, first of\r\nall, the question arises, whether the invention is really a new one;\r\nand to ascertain this is very often a most arduous task. Then, again,\r\nPatents are being asked for mere trifles. Within a short period, 126\r\nPatents for improving bicycles have been taken out in England. It thus\r\nbecomes necessary to make a minute inquiry into the usefulness of the\r\nmatter. This has been the cause that in France they have gone to the\r\nother extreme—granting Patents “without guarantee by Government.”\r\nPatents are not consequent upon the recognition of man’s, or inventors’,\r\nrights; they are the remainders of the guild system, and of protection\r\nto national industry in exclusion of foreign. It cannot be a question\r\nof right of property, for, if such were the case, Patents would not be\r\ngranted for a fixed term of years. If invention means right of property,\r\nwhy, then, that arbitrary restriction? Originally the idea may have\r\nbeen a good one, but in the sequel it has proved a failure. There are\r\nexamples of different persons having made the same invention without\r\nhaving any knowledge of each other. It is consequently becoming almost a\r\nmatter of impossibility to ascertain priority. The hon. member says that\r\nall endeavours to bring about a practical result out of an originally\r\nelevated idea have utterly failed; that the guarantee of the right is,\r\nas has been proved by means of the report in England, at best uncertain\r\nand unsatisfactory; and that when the project shall have been made law,\r\nhe will rejoice at his country having been foremost in leaving the wrong\r\ntrack.\r\n\r\n\r\nSESSION OF TUESDAY, 22ND JUNE.\r\n\r\nThe President reads an address from the Board of Directors of the Union\r\nto Promote Mechanical and Manual Industry, of Rotterdam, in which they\r\nsupport the project now pending before the House.\r\n\r\nThe discussion on the subject is continued.\r\n\r\nM. VAN HOUTEN observes, that M. Heemskerk has given the epithets of\r\n“reactionary” and “ruinous” to the measure proposed by Government. By\r\nopposing the project, that deputy did _his_ duty, but at the same time\r\nit more than ever becomes the duty of those who strenuously support it\r\nopenly to express their convictions, and to show that they know what\r\nthey are about. His opinion is that M. Heemskerk’s arguments have been\r\ntested, and did not stand the test. M. de Bruyn Kops having refrained\r\nfrom arguing on the ground of theoretical considerations, he (M. Van\r\nHouten) will say a few words in that direction. The main question is\r\nthis: Is prohibiting the imitation of an invention lawful, and shall it\r\nor shall it not be upheld? Those who want to let things remain as they\r\nare talk of rights acquired; but on what are these so-called rights\r\nbased? Certainly on no very solid basis; for, if a right it be, why is\r\nonly a temporary protection granted? A right is permanent, and cannot\r\nbe taken away but through expropriation for the common weal, and even\r\nthen in consideration of an indemnity only. M. Heemskerk argues two\r\npoints: 1st, The inventor has a claim of priority, as the first who\r\ntakes possession. 2nd, The imitator enriches himself at the expense of\r\nthe inventor. But, says the hon. member, M. Heemskerk loses sight of the\r\nfact that first occupation can only take place of “corporeal” effects;\r\nnot of an invention which may be made, and is often being made, by others\r\nat the same time. Besides, he contends that it is not the imitators, but\r\nthe public, who enrich themselves and benefit by the invention. He is\r\nof opinion that the Patent system remunerates where no labour has been\r\nexpended; whilst claiming Patents has become an industry prejudicial\r\nto the general public. It has been urged to frame a “good” Patent-Law;\r\nbut that the hon. member holds to be impossible. Whatever might be its\r\nprovisions, monopoly must needs be created by it. And if this is such an\r\neasy matter, why did M. Heemskerk not introduce a bill for a new law? It\r\nis alleged that if everybody is allowed to imitate, the inventor works\r\nfor nothing. But how is it with so many gratuitous appointments? Is\r\nthat a question of right? Certainly not. As M. Heemskerk, in his speech,\r\ninvoked Providence, he should like to know whether it can be supposed\r\nthat Providence intends enriching an individual or society at large? On\r\nthat ground, we may safely set the public’s right against the inventor’s.\r\nHereupon the hon. member considers the question from an economical point\r\nof view. In the first place, Patents are useless for such objects as\r\nbaffle imitation—like the Krupp guns, for instance; and then objects\r\nemanating from the inventor direct are, as a rule, preferred. As for\r\npetty inventions, he would say that, it being the normal course of social\r\ndevelopment that every branch of industry should steadily progress, so\r\nit is the case with them. On that field, everybody is more or less of\r\nan inventor; and with regard to petty inventions, Patents not only are\r\nsuperfluous, but noxious. M. Heemskerk, it is true, has rather spoken\r\nwith a view to great inventions, and the hon. member fancies he has\r\ngiven evident proof that no harm can be done by abolishing Patent-right\r\non the latter. It is these great inventions that the public at large\r\nbenefits by. He denies M. Heemskerk’s assertion, that in the absence of\r\nPatents no capital would be forthcoming for the practical application\r\nof an invention, for, pending the tests and experiments an inventor\r\nsubjects his invention to, no capitalist loans him money. He equally\r\ncontests what M. H. said about the logic of repealing Copyright, should\r\nthe Patent-Law be put aside, and that, by doing the latter, violent\r\nhands would to a certain extent be laid upon the right of property. The\r\nhon. member thinks that no such comparison can be drawn, as the law\r\nproviding for Copyright does by no means prevent anybody from applying\r\nany published work to further development of science. Copyright in no\r\nway interferes with public interests. The member for Gorcum has called\r\nthe project a “reactionary” measure. This will frighten neither him nor\r\nus, for it matters little what is _called_ reactionary, but much what\r\n_is_ reactionary. The project is closely connected with the historical\r\ndevelopment of society, and the liberation of labour and industry. The\r\nPatent system may be placed upon an equal footing with the exclusive\r\nright to discoveries and other similar privileges of yore. We have given\r\nup all those things. Each and every benefit derived from them becomes\r\na public one, and so ought every new outlet for trade to be. On these\r\ngrounds, the hon. member advocates the removal of those impediments.\r\n\r\nM. GODEFROI said:[8] I rise to make some observations on three points\r\nin the speech, containing so much that is valuable, delivered by M.\r\nHeemskerk. These points are, first, the legal basis; secondly, treating\r\nthe question on the footing of Copyright; and, thirdly, the reference\r\nto the practice in foreign countries. The speech of the hon. gentleman\r\nwho preceded me has made my task with reference to the two first points\r\npeculiarly easy, so that I can content myself in a great measure with\r\nsimply referring to it. His confutation of the legal basis, as laid\r\ndown by M. Heemskerk, appears to me conclusive. To speak of occupation\r\nin a non-material sense, to say that the _primus occupans_ can maintain\r\nfor himself or make over to another, on certain conditions, does seem\r\nto me an untenable position. We must take into consideration what the\r\npreceding speaker has already proved, that occupation from which a claim\r\ncan be made, and which one can consider as equivalent to the right of\r\npossession, is inconceivable when the right is of a temporary nature.\r\nBut this is not all. How can any one acquire by occupation anything that\r\nanother at the same moment may occupy in precisely the same way? How\r\nis it possible that two persons at precisely the same moment (and this\r\npossibility is here not to be denied) can by occupation be possessed\r\nof the same right? I shall say no more on the first point. The second\r\npoint, treating the question on the footing of literary property, or\r\nCopyright. I freely admit that, if I were convinced, in case of our\r\nconsenting to pass this Bill, we should be pronouncing the abolition of\r\nCopyright, I should recoil from giving my vote in its favour. But the\r\npreceding speaker has, in my opinion, most clearly shown the points of\r\ndifference between industrial and literary property. I think I may be\r\nallowed to refer, for further confirmation of the view I am taking, to\r\nthe observations of a man held in general consideration, and of especial\r\nweight in this case, inasmuch as he was President of the Commission\r\nappointed by the British Government to inquire into the question of\r\nthe retention or abolition of the “Law of Patents.” I refer to Lord\r\nStanley, who, in a debate in the House of Commons on the 29th May, to\r\nwhich the hon. member for Gorinchem appealed, expressed himself with\r\nregard to the difference between Patent-right and Copyright in a manner\r\nso clear and distinct that I cannot even now see how I can improve upon\r\nhis distinctions. Lord Stanley said, speaking of the distinction: “The\r\nanalogy seemed a plausible one, but he thought that, on being looked\r\ninto, it would not hold water. The difference was simply this: he did not\r\nrest it on any abstract ground as to the distinction between invention\r\nand discovery, but on the obvious fact that no two men ever did or ever\r\nwould write, independently of one another, exactly the same book; each\r\nbook, be it good or bad, would stand alone; whereas it might happen that\r\ntwo or three men, quite independently of one another, would hit upon the\r\nsame invention. That alone established a distinction between the two\r\ncases.” And he was perfectly right. While it is impossible for two men,\r\nindependently of one another, to write the same book, it is not only\r\npossible, but such a case _has_ occurred, for two men to make the same\r\ndiscovery—to light upon the same invention. There are examples of this\r\nin the history of French industry. Daguerre and Niepce both pursued that\r\nline of thought from which photography took its rise, and the fact is so\r\nwell ascertained that when the French Academy of Sciences had to come to\r\na decision about assigning a reward for the invention, they divided the\r\nreward between Daguerre and the children of Niepce, then deceased. In a\r\nreport made by the present Minister of Public Works in Belgium, M. Jamar,\r\nwith reference to property in drawings and models of machinery, the\r\nquestion of Patents is treated, and I notice in it one highly important\r\nobservation applicable to this subject under discussion. It is known—it\r\nappears also in the supplement annexed to the Official Report—that at the\r\nconclusion of the first Great Exhibition in London, the French Commission\r\nbrought out a report, in which the renowned politician, Michel Chevalier,\r\nas the result of conclusions drawn from the Exhibition, declared himself\r\nin favour of unconditional abolition of Patents. How did Michel Chevalier\r\ncome to that opinion? The report to which I refer informs us, and from it\r\nI extract the following passage: “On seeing at the Exhibition in London,\r\nat a few paces from each other, the same machines, the same tools, new\r\nproductions, invented or discovered a thousand miles apart, by men who\r\narrived at the same result sometimes by different ways, legislators and\r\nmagistrates felt themselves bound to ask to what principles of justice\r\nand equity could one of these inventors appeal, that he might obtain a\r\ntemporary monopoly rendering abortive the efforts and experiments on the\r\npart of ten other inventors as persevering, as conscientious, and as\r\nintelligent as himself?” When Michel Chevalier, at the London Exhibition,\r\nhad seen a few paces from each other the same inventions, presented as\r\nthe mental produce of persons who lived thousands of miles apart, and\r\nknew nothing of each other, he might well say that it is impossible to\r\nrecognise an exclusive right. But here is another proof that industrial\r\nproperty and Copyright cannot be put upon the same footing. Moreover,\r\nPatent-right precludes the possibility of the same thought being carried\r\nout, at least for a time, but Copyright does not. Lastly, the third\r\npoint—the appeal to the feeling in foreign countries. M. Heemskerk, in\r\nhis excellent speech of yesterday, made it to appear that the feeling\r\non this subject in foreign countries was that the abolition of Patents\r\nwas condemned. It is perfectly true that at this moment, in most of the\r\nEuropean States, there still subsist laws for conferring Patents. But\r\nmust we thence infer in foreign countries an overwhelming conviction,\r\nthat there must be no abolition? I do not think so. There are, in fact,\r\nevidences on this point worth attending to, which I shall proceed to\r\nlay before the House. How is it in France? The law of 1844 is still in\r\nforce; but is it approved in France? Certainly not. They are convinced\r\nthat the operation of this law has given rise to the most serious\r\ndifficulties. This is a fact; and this fact has led to several proposals\r\nfor modification which have been pending for some years, and are still\r\npending, although the French Chambers get through their work more rapidly\r\nthan we do. The proposals have been already for several years pending,\r\nbecause the carrying them out is hindered by the impression which the\r\nvaluable report of Michel Chevalier has produced, for every day the doubt\r\ngains force whether it is a question of improving the law, or whether\r\nit is not much rather a question of putting an end to the granting of\r\nPatents. England—it is known that two investigations have taken place\r\nin that country. One in 1851, by the Upper House; the other in 1862, by\r\na Government Commission, which issued its report in 1865. What was the\r\nresult of the investigation in 1851? I find the result in the report\r\nof M. Jamar, which I just now referred to. I will read the following\r\nextract: “The result of this inquiry was remarkable. Lord Granville\r\nhad been President of the Commission charged with presenting the Bill,\r\nwhich, while it modified the Law of Patents, respected or left untouched\r\nthe principle. The inquiry so completely modified his convictions, that\r\nhe did not hesitate to declare, in the sitting of the House of Lords on\r\nthe 1st July, 1851, that he considered the issuing of Patents was an\r\nadvantage neither for the inventors nor the public.” So the Commission\r\nof Inquiry, which undertook the task of discovering what amendments\r\ncould be made in the law, came to the conclusion that it would be better\r\nto abolish Patents. I should occupy the House too long were I to quote\r\nall that M. Jamar, in his report, borrowed from this Commission of\r\nInquiry. I will content myself with remarking that, among the witnesses\r\nexamined, and on whose testimony the opinions of the Commission were\r\nfounded, there were men perfectly well qualified to form a judgment.\r\nThey were not only economists, men of science, but also men of business,\r\npractical men: Cubitt, President of the Institution of Civil Engineers;\r\nBrunel, the celebrated engineer; Ricardo, Member of Parliament; Reid,\r\nPresident of the Committee for carrying out the Great Exhibition of\r\n1851; and other industrial and commercial witnesses, so described in\r\nJamar’s report. According to the same Belgian report, the testimony of\r\nthe English judges was very remarkable. They almost unanimously declared\r\nthat it was impossible to apply the law, and that they did not ascribe\r\nthis impossibility to the application of the principle in itself. Lord\r\nGranville declared also, in a sitting of the Upper House, on July 1st,\r\n1851, that his opinion was formed from the sentiments of the judges;\r\nand he added: “The only persons who derive any advantage from the Law\r\nof Patents are the lawyers. Except, perhaps, warrants for horses, there\r\nis no subject which gives such an opportunity for roguery as the Law of\r\nPatents.” And one of the law lords of the Upper House, Lord Campbell,\r\ndeclared, after hearing the speech of Lord Granville, that having\r\nbeen for nine years legal adviser of the Crown, and having had some\r\nexperience in the matter, he coincided perfectly in the opinion of Lord\r\nGranville. The inquiry made by the English Government Commission led\r\nto the same result. In the sitting of the Lower House on May 28 of the\r\npresent year, of which I have already spoken, Lord Stanley distinctly\r\nsaid that he had taken his place in the Commission with the impression\r\nthat the business before them was not to abolish Patents, but to take\r\nmeasures for the amendment of the English law on that subject. During\r\nthe inquiry, however, together with those who took part in it he had\r\ncome to the conclusion that not only the existing law, but every law on\r\nPatents, would meet with almost insurmountable difficulties, because\r\nthese difficulties do not lie in the application, but are inherent in\r\nthe principle. M. Heemskerk made it appear yesterday that the result\r\nof the discussion of May 28 in the Lower House was in favour of the\r\ncontinuance of Patents. I cannot go to such a length in my estimate of\r\nthat discussion. A motion was brought forward by Mr. Macfie, [an ex-]\r\nPresident of the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce, to declare that the time\r\nhad now arrived for the abolition of Patents. At the end of the debate\r\nthe motion was withdrawn by the proposer. Now, the hon. member for\r\nGorinchem has drawn the conclusion, from the course pursued, that the\r\nproposer durst not put his motion to the vote, because he was certain\r\nof a minority. The conclusion is somewhat hasty, for nobody can tell—we\r\nat least cannot—what the vote of the Lower House would have been had\r\nthe motion been put. Besides, the object of the motion appears in the\r\nspeech of the proposer. His chief aim was to invite discussion, “to lay\r\na general view of the subject before the House,” as he expressed it,\r\nrather than to get a decision. In his speech he also gave it as his wish\r\nthat the subject should be again investigated by a Government Commission.\r\nI am of opinion that, from what I have said with reference to England,\r\nthe conclusion cannot be drawn that the retention of Patents is there\r\nthe unqualified and prevailing determination. Belgium: The last law on\r\nPatents, the law of 1854, is there in operation. I know not if it works\r\nwell, and perhaps it would have been worth while for the Government to\r\nget such information. Meanwhile I have a thick volume here before me,\r\ncontaining a commentary on the law, which I have not read completely\r\nthrough. It contains 300 pages, but I have run through it, and it\r\nappears to me that the so-called commentary is in very many respects\r\na criticism on the law, and affords a proof that it by no means works\r\nso extremely well. Last of all, Germany: M. Heemskerk spoke yesterday\r\nof the unanimity of the Germans on the subject of maintaining Patents.\r\nI should not like to admit that unanimity so unreservedly; there are\r\nfacts, at least, opposed to that assertion. This fact, for example, which\r\nwe have extracted from an article in the _Nieuwe Groninger Courant_,\r\njust sent to us, a proposal for the abolition of Patents made to the\r\nNorth German Bund; and if this is carried out, no more Patents will be\r\ngranted in a great portion of Germany. Another fact: so far back as 1864\r\nthe Prussian Government asked the opinion of the Chambers of Commerce\r\non the question whether or not Patents should be maintained, and of\r\nthe 47 there were 31 for the abolition and 16 against it. I scarcely\r\nventure to speak of the economists, otherwise I would appeal to the\r\nGerman Economic Congress of 1863, which pronounced Patents injurious to\r\nthe national welfare. But there is one argument which has more weight\r\nwith me than any other. I am thoroughly persuaded that a good law on\r\nPatents is an impossibility. It is, indeed, matter of regret that the\r\nhon. member for Gorinchem, when he was in the Ministry, did not try to\r\npresent a good law to the Legislature. He was the right man for it. He\r\nwill, however, do me the justice to believe that, when I say this, I do\r\nnot mean to censure him; what I do mean is to express my regret. He is\r\nopen to no censure, for during the time he held office he attended so\r\nassiduously to his duties that even his most violent political opponents\r\nwere compelled to do him honour. But yet it is to be regretted that when\r\nhe was Minister he did not propose an amendment of the law of 1817. We\r\nshould then have seen whether it was possible or not to have a good\r\nefficient law on Patents. For my part, I have arrived at the conclusion\r\nthat it is an impossibility. This is the impression made when one goes\r\nover foreign laws on Patents. There is not a single good one among\r\nthem, nor one which does not give rise to difficulties which hitherto\r\nhave been found to be insurmountable. But there is a further objection.\r\nAccording to my notions, there is a formidable stumbling-block which is\r\ndirectly encountered when one sets to work to frame a law on Patents.\r\nThe question at once presents itself, must it not be proved that the\r\nperson who demands the privilege has a right to it? When has the claimant\r\nthat right? When it is proved that his invention has for its object a\r\nnew industrial product, or a new operation, or a new application of an\r\noperation already known, to obtain an industrial result or an industrial\r\nproduct. The words which I here employ are taken from Art. 2 of the\r\nFrench Law, which, in my opinion, exactly express the object of the law.\r\nI now ask, if a Government is in a position, in this sense, to examine\r\nthe claim of an applicant for a Patent? I shall endeavour to prove that a\r\nGovernment is not in such a position, and I cannot do better than quote\r\nthe words of the author of the report on the French Law of 1844, the\r\ncelebrated Philippe Dupin. We know that the French Law does not undertake\r\nthe preliminary investigation; and, therefore, as we have been already\r\nreminded by M. de Bruyn Kops, when an announcement is made of articles\r\nfor which a Patent is granted in France, the letters S. G. D. G. (_sans\r\ngarantie du Gouvernement_) are generally added. Now, hear what Philippe\r\nDupin says in justification of that principle of French Law, and to\r\nprove the impossibility of a preliminary examination on the part of the\r\nGovernment: “The preliminary examination would be the establishment of\r\na censorship in matters of industry. And how could this censorship be\r\ncarried out? How, for example, are we to decide that an industrial fact\r\nis new, and that it has not been produced in the course of manufacture\r\nor in the retreat of an obscure and industrious workman? How are we to\r\nforesee and judge the amount of utility in a discovery just made, before\r\nit has been developed, before it has been put to the proof? Who will take\r\npart in this debate? Who will represent the parties interested? Where are\r\nthe judges to come from? Who will exercise this jurisdiction by guesswork\r\nin the regions of thought and futurity? Shall it be a clerk turned\r\ninto a judge of what he does not understand? Shall we take a practical\r\nman, who is often only a man of routine, to judge a man of theory and\r\ninspiration? Shall we invite philosophers? But if they are philosophers,\r\nthey are not to be supposed to know everything, and they have their\r\npreferences, their prejudices, their own sets; and the applicant,\r\nperhaps, contradicts their doctrines, their works, their ideas. These\r\nare incontestable impossibilities. It has been said, with as much wit\r\nas reason, in such matters the only suitable proceeding is experience,\r\nthe only competent judge the public.” So much for experience. But, Mr.\r\nPresident, if a Government is not in a position to decide whether the\r\nclaimant of a Patent has a right to it, can it be sanctioned in granting\r\na privilege blindfold which establishes a temporary monopoly? According\r\nto my view, this is a formidable, almost insurmountable, stumbling-block,\r\nwhich, in my deliberate opinion, will always stand in the way of a good\r\nand efficient Law of Patents. I, therefore, am of opinion that no other\r\nsatisfactory course is open to us than to abolish Patents.\r\n\r\nM. VAN VOORTHUYSEN will not enter into many details, the subject having\r\nbeen considered both from a juridical and an economical point of view.\r\nHe will, therefore, restrict himself to a few remarks on M. Heemskerk’s\r\nspeech. The hon. member acknowledges the satisfaction the project gives\r\nhim; it gratifies the feelings to which he has given vent a great many\r\ntimes. It has been said that the measure was a step backward, as Patents\r\nhave taken the place of exclusive privileges to guilds. At the time the\r\nPatent-right was assuredly an improvement on the then existing system;\r\nbut we have been progressing so much since then that at present nothing\r\nshort of abolition will satisfy the wants of progress. He also refers\r\nto the conclusion arrived at by Lord Stanley, which point M. Heemskerk\r\nhas left unnoticed—viz., 1st, that it is impossible to reward all who\r\ndeserve to be rewarded; 2nd, that it is impossible to reward adequately\r\nto the service rendered to society at large; 3rd, that it is impossible\r\nto hold third parties harmless from damage. And, in fact, the alleged\r\ninstance of the Daguerre prize having been divided with another who\r\nequally proved his claim to the invention, speaks for itself. It is\r\ndoubtful who was the first inventor of the steam-engine; there are\r\nseveral, at least, who claim the invention as their own. There is another\r\npoint he feels bound to refer to. M. Heemskerk has said that abolishing\r\nPatents constitutes an attack upon the right of property, and that deputy\r\ncautions against a first step, perhaps to be followed up by others. This\r\nbeing a very serious inculpation, the hon. member has asked the opinion\r\nof an eminent jurist, whom he will not name as yet, whose authority M.\r\nHeemskerk is not likely to deny, and who is in many respects congenial\r\nwith that esteemed deputy. The hon. member reads that opinion of one of\r\nthe foremost opponents of Patent-right, who calls it an obnoxious and\r\nintolerable monopoly. And who is that clever jurist? It is M. Wintgens,\r\nwho very likely owed to his extraordinary acquirements in law matters\r\nhis appointment to the Department of Justice in the Heemskerk van Zuylen\r\nMinistry.\r\n\r\nM. FOCK (Secretary of State for Home Affairs) will not have much to say,\r\nafter all which has been argued in yesterday’s and to-day’s Session, in\r\ndefence of the project. Nevertheless he will indulge in a few remarks\r\non the final report. With a view to the same, M. Heemskerk submits the\r\nmaintenance of Patents for inventions, but the repeal of those “of\r\nadmission.” But the Minister calls the attention of the House to the\r\ncircumstance that the Patents for inventions which are being granted may\r\naggregate to ten a year or thereabout. What should remain for us to keep?\r\nOr else agents here will apply for Patents on foreign inventions, so that\r\n“Patents of admission” will re-appear under a different denomination.\r\nM. Godefroi has already pointed to instances abroad, and the Minister\r\ncan but add that, despite M. Heemskerk’s assertion to the contrary, the\r\nPrussian Government is by no means favourably disposed to the Patent-Law.\r\nIn December, 1868, Count von Bismarck addressed a message to the North\r\nGerman Confederation, embodying the opinion of the Prussian Government\r\nin favour of repeal, and even hinting that Prussia would not mind\r\ntaking the lead in the matter.[9] After entering into a few more details\r\nconcerning the final report, the Minister once more demonstrates that\r\nPatents are great impediments to industry and free-trade, and that it is\r\nin the public’s interest that they should be abolished. The Netherlands,\r\nhaving once been foremost in doing away with the tax on knowledge, must\r\nnot now shrink from conferring entire freedom on the field of industry.\r\nThat is no reaction. Is it reaction to break off with an intolerable\r\nstate of things? No; it is progress, and leads to free development. The\r\nMinister concludes with a citation from Michel Chevalier, and declines to\r\ntake M. Heemskerk’s hint of deferring the discussion on the project.\r\n\r\nM. HEEMSKERK AZN replies. He tenders thanks for the urbanity observed\r\nthroughout the discussion. But it is undeniable that his opinion agrees\r\nwith the existing right and the prevalent ideas in Europe and America.\r\nOf course, if revocation is intended, improvement of the law has to be\r\ngiven up. In reply to the Minister, he has no doubt but that the desire\r\nfor revocation originated in Prussia, but he has said that in Germany the\r\ntide has turned in favour of Patents, on the strength of the “Deutsche\r\nIndustrie Zeitung” and Klosterman’s recent work. The revocation of the\r\nPatent-Law may have been contemplated, but the Prussian Government is\r\nnot now disposed to have the idea carried out. He asks but for what the\r\nEnglish equally asked for—_i.e._, a renewed inquiry. What, after all, is\r\nforeign experience to the exercise of law in the Netherlands? How does\r\nthe project tally with the establishment of a new division of industry\r\nin the Department for Internal Affairs, the chief occupation of which is\r\nthe granting of Patents? He will not argue with the Minister on general\r\nremarks, but merely on the one relating to the abolition of newspaper\r\nstamps. Why has that tax been repealed? If henceforth a larger quantity\r\nof paper be covered with print, the tax has most likely been done away\r\nwith to promote the diffusion of general knowledge. He supposes, however,\r\nthe Minister will agree with Cicero, who says that fame acquired by\r\nmeans of deeds which are not useful is but vanity. The stamp duty has\r\nbeen repealed in order to be useful. And in the present case, will the\r\nMinister deny all benefits to him who does his utmost, so as to be\r\nuseful? He replies also to the several members who have made speeches;\r\nhe contradicts M. de Bruyn Kops about a general disposition supposed to\r\nexist in France towards revocation of Patent-Laws. Michel Chevalier only\r\nhas changed his mind, but there is no opinion prevailing against Patents.\r\nQuite recently both Joseph Garnier and Wolowski have refuted Chevalier’s\r\narguments.\r\n\r\nThe hon. member further insists upon _his_ interpretation of the\r\nParliamentary debates in England, and names several instances of\r\ninventors having acquired wealth. He does not admit that there is a\r\ndifference between Patent-right and Copyright; imitation of articles of\r\nfabrication is, and will remain, as immoral as it is unfair. He shrinks\r\nfrom touching the legal side of the question, but asks whether, because\r\nof the Patent-right being restricted to a fixed time, the conclusion must\r\nneeds be drawn that absolutely no right should exist, and that there\r\nshould be no plea in equity whatever for an inventor to get rewarded\r\nfor his labours? Does the abstract question of occupation of immaterial\r\nthings cripple that hypothesis in any way? He considers it from a more\r\ngeneral and social point of view, and vindicates his assertion that an\r\ninventor is entitled to a certain amount of protection for his work, by\r\nwhich, at all events, he renders a service to society; that Patents are\r\nincitements to many useful inventions and to industry, which is equally\r\nM. de Bruyn Kops’ opinion, as stated in his work on political economy. He\r\nhas been asked why, when in the Ministry, he did not introduce a Patent\r\nReform Law. In the first place, he begs to observe that much was to be\r\ndone then, and besides, considering the smallness of our country, he\r\nindulged in the anticipation that the idea of an international agreement\r\nmight gradually have gained ground. Should he, however, have lived\r\nlonger (politically speaking), he _would_ most likely have introduced a\r\nBill for remodelling the Patent-Law. As for M. Wintgen’s opinion, it is\r\nalmost superfluous to say that one is not bound to have in every respect\r\nhomogeneous ideas with one’s political friends. In reply to the question\r\nwhy, as a member of the House, he does not make a proposal, he accepts\r\nthe invitation, and will in September next be prepared to take, as a\r\nmember of the House, the initiative of presenting a Bill for Reforming\r\nthe Patent-Law, provided the project now pending be no longer discussed.\r\n\r\nM. VAN ZINNICK BERGMANN replies, and maintains his opinion about the\r\njustice of the Patent-right.\r\n\r\nM. DE BRUYN KOPS refutes M. Heemskerk’s reply, and demonstrates, by\r\nmeans of fresh examples, that the Patent-right is intolerable and most\r\nobnoxious. He considers the question now merely economically; MM. van\r\nHouten and Godefroi having so ably discussed the legal points. The\r\nlarge benefits acquired by a few are, as taken from his point of view,\r\nprejudicial to the public at large, and against these few advantages\r\nthere are great damages, as large capitals dwindle away in the chase for\r\nthe snare of Patents. M. Heemskerk himself favours the revocation of\r\nPatents on the right “of admission.” What is left after that? Nothing but\r\nthe Patents of invention. Why not try entire freedom and removal of all\r\nimpediments?\r\n\r\nM. GODEFROI will add one word more with reference to M. Heemskerk’s\r\nreadiness in accepting the challenge, of framing a new project of law,\r\nand he must say that, whatever be the nature of such proposal, it can\r\nhardly be expected to satisfy those who condemn the principles of\r\nPatent-Law. But the orator who is so well posted must certainly have\r\nframed already the main points from which the project would have to\r\nbe formed. By stating and explaining those points, he would have done\r\nmore service to the House than by mere opposition to those who favour\r\nabolition. The hon. member repeats the important query, whether Patents\r\nshould be granted without previously inquiring into the merits of the\r\ncase; and then Government would have to give its opinion just as well on\r\nan improved chignon as on an improved steam-engine.\r\n\r\nM. GEFKEN gives his motives for voting in favour of the project. He\r\nsays, where there is a right of property, it must be permanent, and even\r\ntransferable to the heirs; but a guarantee for a few years would not do.\r\nHe consequently does not recognise the right of property, and merely\r\nconsiders the question with a view to usefulness; and, as far as that\r\ngoes, his experience in administrative and juridical offices has taught\r\nhim that Patents are not actually useful, and, on the contrary, lead\r\nto speculation and impede the development of many a useful concern. He\r\nfavours free competition.\r\n\r\nM. VAN VOORTHUYSEN will not revert to M. Bergmann’s remark about his\r\nbeing accustomed to recapitulate the debates, but denies having intended\r\nto force upon him the authority of M. Wintgen’s opinion. Such is not the\r\ncase; but the fact of the opinions of two such jurists as MM. Godefroi\r\nand Wintgen agreeing has set his mind at rest as far as legal opinion is\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nM. HEEMSKERK AZN replies to M. Godefroi, and does not see why he should\r\njust now go and sketch his project. Give him time and opportunity, and he\r\nwill introduce a Bill, provided this project be deferred; and, in fact,\r\nwhat are they making such haste for?\r\n\r\nMinister FOCK maintains his sayings about the Prussian Government\r\nfavouring revocation, and further explains that the new division in\r\nhis department has no connexion with Patents, but was made so as to\r\nconcentrate all matters referring to industry. As for the right of\r\nproperty in inventions, he would merely add that, according to our\r\nlegislation, Patents are but favours, which may be granted or not, as the\r\ncase may be.\r\n\r\nHereupon the discussion is closed.\r\n\r\nWith reference to Art. 1, M. Lenting asks, why the date on which the new\r\nlaw has to take effect should be fixed for the 1st January next. He would\r\nprefer that the words be, “After the day of the publication of the law;”\r\nthen no new Patents would be granted, those already applied for only\r\nexcepted.\r\n\r\nThe Minister inserts the amendment, after which Arts. 1 and 2 are passed.\r\n\r\nThe project is then put to the vote, and passes the House by 49 ayes\r\nagainst 8 noes.\r\n\r\nAgainst it voted MM. Bichon, Blussé, Vader, Hofmann, Heemskerk Azn, Van\r\nWassenaer, and Van Zinnick Bergmann.\r\n\r\n[8] For this translation I am indebted to the Foreign-office, to whose\r\nreports I have been politely allowed access.\r\n\r\n[9] This admirable document is prefixed, see page 185.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM THE DUTCH GOVERNMENT MEMORIAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project of law, which is accompanied by an extensive memorial of\r\nexplanation, contains the following stipulations:—\r\n\r\n    _Article 1._—From and after the 1st of January, 1870, no\r\n    fresh Patents for inventions and improvements, or the first\r\n    introduction of objects of art and industry, shall be granted,\r\n    those only excepted for which application shall have been made\r\n    previous to that date.\r\n\r\n    _Article 2._—The term for Patents formerly granted or\r\n    deliverable within the provisions of Article 1 of this law may\r\n    be extended in accordance with the law of 25th January, 1817.\r\n    (Vide “_Staatsblad_,” No. 6.)\r\n\r\nThe memorial says, _inter alia_:—\r\n\r\n“In order to let Netherlands industry and Netherlands people reap the\r\nbenefit of the bulk of improvements in industry, the best course to take\r\nappears to be the repeal of the Patent-Law.\r\n\r\n“The first requisite of a reform of the existing legislation on Patents\r\nwould be to more completely guarantee their rights to inventors, they\r\nbeing by no means sufficiently protected by the provisions of the law now\r\nin force.\r\n\r\n“Considering, however, the consequences of any kind of Patent-Law, the\r\nmeans that are to be employed and the expenses to be incurred, so as to\r\nrender all parties interested quite familiar with the Patents granted;\r\nthe fact that, in consequence of the development of industry, the number\r\nof Patents is increasing, the result of which is more and more to burden\r\nthe exercise of the sundry branches of industry with a larger portion\r\nof obstructive privileges, besides the abuses and wrong practice to\r\nwhich they lead; in one word, the price which the public have to pay,\r\ncompared with the very few inventors, whose advantage is even at best\r\nuncertain—considering all these points, there can hardly be a doubt as\r\nto the choice the Netherlands ought to make, placed as they are between\r\nthe dark path leading to more obnoxious privileges and the highway where\r\nfreedom of movement prevails.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe subjoin the following, with which we have been favoured, on the same\r\nsubject:—\r\n\r\nThe project of law to repeal the Act of 1817 for granting exclusive\r\nrights on inventions and improvements of objects of art and industry,\r\nhas given general satisfaction in four Committees of the House, and many\r\nhave received it enthusiastically. By introducing this Bill, Government\r\nhas satisfied a desire which of late was frequently manifested by members\r\nof the House. The memorial of explanation, with its vouchers, gives\r\nfull particulars of the objections raised against the Patent system.\r\nMost members, in fact, simply gave their adhesion in substance, without\r\nconsidering it necessary to “motivate” their opinion.\r\n\r\nA few Members of one of the Committees did not agree with absolute\r\nrepeal, and even held such a measure to be at variance with justice and\r\nequity; they recognised the law of 1817 to be defective and in many\r\ncases impracticable; they granted that when a reform might be arrived at\r\n“Patents of admission” ought not to remain in force; but they did not\r\nsee why, on account of the insufficiency of the law in this country,\r\n“Patents for invention” should be abolished as well. There are a good\r\nmany industrial inventions which cost the originator vast mental labour,\r\nsometimes even heavy pecuniary sacrifice. By means of his invention\r\nhe renders society a service which entitles him to enjoy, for a fixed\r\nperiod at least, the exclusive benefit of bringing it into operation.\r\nShould this benefit be denied him, it would be but fair that the State\r\nshould give him a reward; this, however, is subject to difficulties of a\r\npeculiar nature.\r\n\r\nThe opinion that the repeal of the law would leave intellectual property\r\naltogether unprotected, may be refuted by the fact that the principle of\r\nintellectual property cannot possibly form the basis for a Patent-Law.\r\nAlthough it was emphatically proclaimed in the French Legislature of the\r\nfirst years subsequent to the Revolution of 1789, it will not stand the\r\ntest of sound criticism. Could right of property be admitted in this\r\ncase, it ought to be permanent, and not temporary. Yet no Legislature\r\never dared to extend the so-called right, even for the inventor’s\r\nlifetime; the terms were generally ten, twelve, fifteen, and, at most,\r\ntwenty years. Another circumstance, which is in downright contradiction\r\nwith the notion of right of property, is the fact that everywhere Patents\r\nare granted only on payment of a certain sum.\r\n\r\nIf Patents are to be defended at all, better try to do it on a principle\r\nof utility. Some appearances are in favour of the plea that anticipation\r\nof reward and pecuniary benefit originates useful inventions; but\r\npecuniary experience has taught that although every now and then this may\r\nbe the case, still the very existence of a strict Patent-Law, is, on the\r\nwhole, a decided hindrance to industry; that the inventor’s benefit from\r\nhis Patent is, in most instances, but doubtful, whereas by doing away\r\nwith this artificial encouragement, inventions will not, on this account,\r\nremain in the bud undeveloped.\r\n\r\nA strict Patent-Law is subject to strange drawbacks, which have been\r\nchiefly demonstrated by the inquiry in England; whilst in Holland the\r\nwell-known decision of the Supreme Court of 1846 has well-nigh vitiated\r\nit.\r\n\r\nUnder the circumstances, no choice was left our Government but between\r\na stricter law than before and complete freedom. Very justly it has\r\ndeclared in favour of the latter, and, as it states, chiefly Switzerland\r\nin its eye, where very many branches of industry are in a most\r\nflourishing condition, ascribable, in part at least, to the very absence\r\nof Patent-Laws, with their escort of drawbacks and law-suits. There the\r\nmanufacturer goes upon his own errand, avails himself of inventions made\r\nby others, and, if he cannot at once get at the bottom of the same, tries\r\nto arrive at them through his own exertions and his own ponderings.\r\n\r\nThe step taken by Government deserves the more approbation, inasmuch as\r\nno legislation can sufficiently guarantee to the real inventor _that_\r\nexclusive right which is considered a reward for the service rendered to\r\nsociety. Not seldom it happens that the inventor is a scholar, who makes\r\nthe fruit of his labours public, leaving to others the deriving pecuniary\r\nbenefits from it.\r\n\r\nSome persons, adverse to Patent-Laws, cannot yet make up their minds as\r\nto the new system being in accordance with morality, and perhaps be an\r\nencouraging of the dishonesty which lies in the appropriation of another\r\nman’s invention, thereby reminding the Netherlander of Güttenburg. To\r\nthis we may bring forward the argument that, as far as the deed ascribed\r\nto that German falls within the limits of theft, or of violation of\r\ncontract between master and servant, nobody will defend it; but in the\r\ncircumstance that Güttenburg, having once mastered the art, applied it to\r\nbring it into operation, and by exerting his intellect, raised it to a\r\nmuch higher pitch of perfection, there lies nothing dishonest. If these\r\nproceedings be incriminated, then the principle ought to be transferred\r\nto another field—that of trade. Then the merchant who takes advantage of\r\na new outlet or a new branch of commerce inaugurated by another, ought to\r\nbe reprobated; but if so, farewell to all competition—nay, to the very\r\nprinciple of free-trade.\r\n\r\nA few of the supporters of the Patent-Law ask whether Copyright does\r\nnot rest upon the same basis as the exclusive right to inventions, and\r\nwhether the new law will not be followed in its wake by the ignoring\r\nof literary property. But against a few similarities we have a material\r\ndifference in substance.\r\n\r\nIf not all, yet most literary productions bear such a marked stamp of\r\nindividuality, that intellectual property cannot be contested. However it\r\nmay be, the different subjects have each their own laws, and both authors\r\nand publishers we quite leave out of the question.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPINION OF THE LEADING JOURNAL OF HOLLAND, THE “ALGEMEEN HANDELSBLAD.”\r\n\r\nIn the history of the Netherlands economy, the 22nd June, 1869, will be\r\nlong remembered. Whatever shall be the decision of the First Chamber,\r\nthe fact of the Law [Bill] having passed the Second Chamber by 48 yeas\r\nagainst 8 noes is a highly gratifying occurrence.\r\n\r\nThe chief feature in the opposition on the part of the Conservatives was\r\nthe able speeches made by their leader, M. Heemskerk, in order to prove\r\nthat invention confers a right of property. Without going into the merits\r\nof the case, we cannot help recording that, in the opinion of those that\r\nside with M. H., it must be a suggestive circumstance that, despite\r\nall the earnest pleading of the honourable gentleman, 48 out of 57\r\nrepresentatives, of men of the highest moral and intellectual standing,\r\ndid vote for abolition, and still did not intend despoiling anybody of\r\nhis own.\r\n\r\nInvention is the effusion of thought, and just as thought cannot but be\r\nfree, so invention must be the same.\r\n\r\nWe hope that the Netherlands will not long remain alone in this instance.\r\nAt any rate, we may be proud of the overwhelming majority of men able to\r\nunderstand the real means of progress.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACT FROM AN OBLIGING PRIVATE LETTER.\r\n\r\n                                                 Amsterdam, June 28, 1869.\r\n\r\n... In some respects, the rather powerful arguments of the members\r\nwho were favourable to the continuance of the system of Patents—and\r\nwho contended that an inventor, the same as an author, has a right\r\nto protection of his individual mind-work—were defeated, principally\r\nby the pretty general opinion of the majority that it would be\r\nnext to impossible to adopt any new Law on Patents efficient to\r\nprotect one inventor without at the same time injuring not only some\r\nbrother-inventor, but also the public at large.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM THE “FRANKFORT JOURNAL,” JULY 21.\r\n\r\nThe abolition of the Patent-Laws in the Netherlands will, it is evident,\r\nnot remain without influence on the decision which other European\r\nStates, and in particular those of Germany, will form in regard to\r\nthese laws. Of the two countries, one of which is in possession of the\r\nsources of the Rhine, and the other of its mouths—the former the most\r\nindustrious country in the world, never had a Patent-Law; the latter,\r\neminent for its foresight, dispenses with those laws. Through this act\r\nare intensified the unsatisfactory circumstances which the existence of\r\nthese laws produces, and the want of confidence which is felt in their\r\nadvantage to inventors and the public. The number of their defenders is\r\nconstantly declining. People are daily more and more becoming convinced\r\nthat these laws belong to the same category as the Usury-Laws and the\r\nCorn-Laws, and other similar excrescences introduced by bureaucracy, and\r\nthat they should be thrown into the lumber-room of laws which effect the\r\nvery reverse of what they profess to do. They stop progress. Inventions\r\nof importance can always be made useful to the inventors without\r\nPatent-Laws. Great inventors might perhaps be indemnified by Government\r\non behalf of a nation, but as for the innumerable herd of small inventors\r\nwho prosecute inventing as a trade, they cause the consumer severe injury\r\ninstead of benefiting him. Since Patents for inventions in Germany do not\r\nextend to protection against dealing in foreign articles patented here,\r\nwe may consider the abolition of Patents in the Netherlands a reason why\r\nPatent monomaniacs should now ask themselves whether the cost is likely\r\nhereafter to yield a good return.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCEEDINGS IN LIVERPOOL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of the Council on July, 1869, E. K. MUSPRATT, Esq., rose and\r\nspoke to the following effect:—\r\n\r\nMr. President,—I rise to call your attention to the late debate on the\r\nPatent-Law. This Chamber has frequently expressed its dissatisfaction\r\nwith the working of the present law, and after the issue of the Report\r\nof the Royal Commission on the subject, endeavoured to bring about an\r\ninquiry into the policy of granting Patents for inventions. I cannot\r\nbut think the time has now arrived for further action in this matter.\r\nThe late debate upon the motion of Mr. Macfie has re-awakened public\r\ninterest in the subject, and it is gratifying to note, both in the\r\ndebate itself and the subsequent discussion in the newspapers, that the\r\nformerly very prevalent idea of a natural property in inventions has been\r\ntacitly abandoned. In some of the arguments used the old fallacy seems\r\nto lurk, for the _Pall Mall Gazette_, in a very able article, says: “It\r\nis plausible to say that if there were no property in invention every\r\none would get the benefit of all inventions; but this appears to us to\r\nhave some analogy to the notion that if there were no property in land\r\nevery one would get the benefit of the crops.” There is, however, a\r\nvery great difference, because an invention cannot possibly yield all\r\nthe benefits which society can derive from it until it becomes public\r\nproperty; whereas all experience proves that land, in order to yield\r\nthe greatest results, must become and remain individual property. Let\r\nus discard, therefore, all comparison of property in invention with\r\nother property, and discuss the subject as one of expediency. Is it the\r\ninterest of the community at large that Patents should be granted for\r\ninventions? I am not prepared to say whether or not inventors should\r\nbe remunerated by the State; but, after mature consideration, I have\r\ncome to the conclusion that, in the interests of the nation and of all\r\nengaged in industry, Patents for invention should be abolished. A Patent\r\nis a monopoly, a patentee a monopolist. When the Protectionist system\r\nwas in vogue, Patents which were in full harmony with that system could\r\nbe justified; but in these days of Free-trade all monopolies which act\r\nin restraint of trade should be abolished. Some of the arguments used\r\nin support of the system of Protection to inventors by granting to\r\nthem a monopoly of manufacture are, to my mind, very similar to those\r\nused in former days in support of other monopolies. Before the repeal\r\nof the Navigation Laws, it was said that without them our marine would\r\nbe destroyed, and no more ships would be built, because there would be\r\nno inducement to build them. Without Patents, say the defenders of the\r\nsystem, there will be no inventions, because there will be no special\r\ninducement to make them. We maintain, however, that under a freer system\r\ninvention would be stimulated, and not restrained. As was well pointed\r\nout by Sir R. Palmer in his able speech, “Bounties and premiums might be\r\nadapted to a rude state of the arts and an early stage in the progress\r\nof commerce; but when a nation had reached so high a degree of progress\r\nin all ingenious arts and discoveries, and in trade and commerce, as we\r\nhad, he thought that in this department, as well as in others, the system\r\nof bounties and premiums was much more likely to be mischievous than\r\nuseful.” He then very clearly showed how the Patent system worked; how,\r\nin the place of securing the reward to great and meritorious inventions,\r\nit gave a monopoly to the first claimer of those minor improvements\r\nwhich he classed as unmeritorious Patents, and which improvements would\r\nnecessarily be made in the ordinary progress of manufacture. As an\r\nexample of this, I may mention the manufacture of artificial manures. The\r\nmodern history of manures dates from the publication of Liebig’s book\r\nin 1840, in which the conversion of insoluble into soluble phosphate\r\nof lime is recommended. This suggestion has been perhaps more fruitful\r\nin results than any other of modern times, and forms the basis of the\r\nenormous manufacture of super-phosphate and other artificial manures. It\r\nwas patented in 1842, not by Liebig, but by Mr. Lawes; and since that\r\nperiod various improvements in the manufacture have been patented, but\r\nthe real inventor has never been rewarded. There can be no doubt that\r\nwithout a system of Patents all of the subsequent minor improvements\r\nwould have been made in the ordinary course of trade; and one of the\r\nmain objects of the Patent-Law, to secure a reward to the inventor, has,\r\nin this instance, as in many others, failed of accomplishment. Then, on\r\nthe other hand, all these minor improvements, being patented, stand in\r\nthe way of further progress, and if the manufacturer wishes to adopt a\r\nnew process, or to improve his manufacture, he must do it at the peril\r\nof litigation with some unknown person, who at some time or other has\r\nthought fit to claim for himself a monopoly. No matter whether his\r\nclaim be good or bad, it stands in the way of improvement until it is\r\neither disclaimed by the patentee himself or pronounced invalid in a\r\ncourt of law. As an example of how, under the present system, a patentee\r\nmay create a virtual monopoly and embarrass manufacturers even when\r\nhis claims are, according to his own showing, to a very great extent\r\ninvalid, permit me to draw your attention to a Patent, No. 12,867, A.D.\r\n1849, for compressing peat for fuel, making gas, &c., and with which I\r\nunfortunately became acquainted, because the patentee, under another\r\nPatent (connected, however, with the first), endeavoured to make my\r\nfirm pay him for the use of a substance in the manufacture of sulphuric\r\nacid. Now, the patentee, Mr. F. C Hills, finding, I presume, that in its\r\nfirst state his Patent was invalid, filed what is technically termed a\r\ndisclaimer, in 1853; and on comparing the original specification, which\r\nis very long and consists of about 230 lines, I find at least one-half\r\nis disclaimed. This Patent secured to Mr. Hills the monopoly of the\r\npurification of gas by means of oxide of iron; and although, owing to\r\nthe exertion of the Liverpool Gas Company, he failed to have it renewed\r\nat the expiration of fourteen years, by a subsequent Patent for the use\r\nof the said oxide (after it has been used in the purification of gas)\r\nin the manufacture of sulphuric acid, he continues virtually to enjoy\r\nthat monopoly, and to prevent chemical manufacturers having access to\r\nwhat, under certain circumstances, may be a cheap source of sulphur. And\r\nthis I would wish you to bear in mind, although the second Patent is\r\nundoubtedly invalid. It would detain you too long were I to enter into\r\nfull detail on the subject, but I may mention that our firm used some\r\n2,000 or 3,000 tons of this gas refuse from the Liverpool Gas Works,\r\nwhen pyrites was high in price; and it was only because of the annoyance\r\nand waste of time which a law-suit would have cost that we relinquished\r\nits use in our manufacture when the price of pyrites fell. But this case\r\nis but a sample, and I have no doubt every manufacturer has experienced\r\nsimilar loss and inconvenience from the action of the Patent-Law. When\r\nwe consider that there are at the present moment 11,369 Patents in\r\nforce, most of them as invalid as that to which I have referred, and\r\nacting as a restriction on manufacturers, we may form some idea of\r\nwhat the community at large has to pay for the luxury of a Patent-Law.\r\nBut it may be said these objections are due to the imperfections and\r\nmal-administration of the Patent-Law. I would refer you, then, to\r\nthe Report of the Royal Commission, which, in conclusion, says that\r\n“these inconveniences are, in their belief, inherent in the nature of a\r\nPatent-Law, and must be considered as the price which the public consents\r\nto pay for the existence of such a law.” There is, however, another\r\naspect of the question which must not be lost sight of. The Lower House\r\nof the States-General of Holland has, by a large majority, voted the\r\nabolition of Patents. In Switzerland they don’t exist; and in Prussia,\r\nowing to a very strict preliminary examination, faithfully carried out,\r\nthey are very few in number. We in this country have to compete with\r\nthe manufacturers of these countries; and is it fair, I would ask, that\r\nwe should be thus weighted in the race? I beg to move that a petition\r\nbe prepared for presentation to the House of Commons, praying for the\r\nappointment of a Committee to inquire into the policy of granting Patents\r\nfor invention.\r\n\r\n(The motion was unanimously adopted.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCORRESPONDENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subjoined letters, with which I am favoured, will be read with\r\ninterest and advantage:—\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM SIR WILLIAM ARMSTRONG, C.B.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs to the cost of the system to the public, I don’t see how it could be\r\ncalculated, for it consists not merely of the licence fees, but also of\r\nthe loss resulting from the stamping out of competition, which would\r\ncheapen production and, in most cases, lead to improvement. My great\r\nobjection to our indiscriminate Patent system is, that it is scarcely\r\npossible to strike out in any new direction without coming in contact\r\nwith Patents for schemes so crudely developed as to receive little or no\r\nacceptance from the public, but which, nevertheless, block the road to\r\nreally practical improvement.\r\n\r\nNothing, I think, can be more monstrous than that so grave a matter as\r\na monopoly should be granted to any person for anything without inquiry\r\neither as to private merit or public policy—in fact, merely for the\r\nasking and the paying. Amongst other evils of this indiscriminate system\r\nis that the majority of Patents granted are bad, and yet such is the\r\ndread of litigation, that people submit to a Patent they know to be bad\r\nrather than involve themselves in the trouble and expense of resisting\r\nit. So that a bad Patent, in general, answers just as well as a good one.\r\n\r\nOne of the most common arguments in favour of Patents is, that they are\r\nnecessary to protect the poor inventor, but it is manufacturers and\r\ncapitalists, and not working men, who make great profits by Patents,\r\nand that, too, in a degree which has no reference either to the merit\r\nof the inventor or the importance of the invention. One rarely hears of\r\na working man making a good thing of a Patent. If he hits upon a good\r\nidea he has seldom the means of developing it to a marketable form, and\r\nhe generally sells it for a trifle to a capitalist, who brings it to\r\nmaturity and profits by it. He could sell his idea just as well without\r\nany Patent-Law.\r\n\r\nMay 13, 1869.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM ANOTHER HIGH PRACTICAL AUTHORITY, LIKEWISE A NOTABLE INVENTOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nI would not for one moment deny that instances could be named in which\r\nthe absence of a Patent-Law might have proved a hardship to a real\r\ninventor, but I feel quite satisfied in my own mind that whatever\r\nmay hitherto have been the case, the time has now fully arrived when\r\ninfinitely less injustice would, upon the whole, be occasioned by the\r\nabsence of all Patent-Laws than by the best Patent-Law that could be\r\ndevised. All Patents for inventions must be considered as founded upon\r\nexpediency and not upon the idea of any inherent right which the inventor\r\npossesses beyond the right of using his invention, or keeping the\r\nsecret of it to himself. A community may consider it to their advantage\r\nto protect inventions by means of Patent-Laws, but a man can have no\r\nabstract or natural right to the exclusive benefits of his invention, for\r\nsuch an idea would imply that nobody else could have produced it. The\r\nquestion is, therefore, entirely one of expediency, but not one of right.\r\nAgain, a very common argument used in support of a Patent-Law is that\r\nan inventor is as much entitled to an exclusive right to his invention\r\nas an author is to the produce of his pen, but there is really very\r\nlittle resemblance between the two cases, and I believe it would be very\r\ninexpedient to utterly abolish Copyright. “Paradise Lost” would never\r\nhave been written but for Milton; but with the utmost respect for Bell,\r\nFulton, and Stephenson, who would pretend to believe that without them we\r\nshould still have to be dependent upon the wind for our movements at sea,\r\nand the common road ashore? A man who writes a book does not interfere\r\nwith me in the slightest degree, but the inventor, or more probably the\r\nso-called inventor, backed by the Patent-Law, may most unjustly involve\r\nme in much trouble and expense. I should be very glad to see a good round\r\nsum set apart by Government for the purpose of being awarded to real\r\ninventors by competent and impartial authority. Then the poor inventor\r\nmight have some chance. You will certainly, in my opinion, have done a\r\ngood turn to this country if you can only get every vestige of Patent-Law\r\nswept from the statute-book, and with my best wishes for the success of\r\nyour motion, I am, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM ANDREW JOHNSTON, ESQ., M.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                           7th July, 1869.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nI am glad to hear that you intend printing the results of your inquiries\r\nas to the operation of the Patent-Laws, as the conclusions at which you\r\nhave arrived tally entirely with my own experience as a manufacturer.\r\n\r\nI had no opportunity of speaking in the recent debate on your motion, and\r\nwill therefore put down one or two points which have specially presented\r\nthemselves to my attention.\r\n\r\nI am not biased, I believe, by self-interest, as the business with which\r\nI am connected has profited to a considerable extent by the purchase of\r\npatented inventions; but it is my firm conviction that the commonwealth\r\nwould benefit by the refusal of the State in future to grant Patents.\r\n\r\nNothing can be more superficial than the objection that the intelligent\r\nworking man benefits by the present system. For one such who really\r\nbenefits by his invention, ten sell theirs for the merest fraction of its\r\nvalue; ten others who may get a fair price are led, by the possession\r\nof the capital sum so obtained, to give up regular employment, and\r\ngenerally “muddle away” all the money in seeking to “invent” afresh,\r\nwhile the remaining seventy-nine reap nothing by their invention but\r\ndisappointment, privation, and misery.\r\n\r\nAbolish Patents, and these men would stick to regular work. They would\r\nchoose the service of employers who had a name for liberally rewarding\r\ntheir workmen for ingenious and profitable inventions, and also for the\r\ninsight necessary to decide whether inventions were so or not. Employers\r\nwould vie with one another in getting such a name, and the whole tone and\r\nlevel of the artisans would be perceptibly raised, while useful invention\r\nwould proceed faster than at present, because the certainty of moderate\r\nrewards would stimulate men more than the remote chance of large ones.\r\n\r\nNo doubt you want facts rather than opinions. I can testify to this\r\nmuch as to another branch of the subject: when there is an infringement\r\nof a Patent, or supposed infringement, and an appeal to the law is\r\nin prospect, it never occurs to either party to consider whether the\r\nPatent-rights in question are good, bad, or indifferent. It is too well\r\nknown that the longest purse will win, and that whichever party is\r\nprepared to spend most money will defeat and probably ruin the other.\r\n\r\nMake any use you like of these notes.\r\n\r\n                            Yours, very truly,\r\n\r\n                                                          ANDREW JOHNSTON.\r\n\r\nR. A. Macfie, Esq., M.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN COPYRIGHT AND PATENT-RIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following is reproduced under a conviction formed by hearing, in the\r\nrecent debate, so much stress laid on the resemblance of Patent-right to\r\nCopyright, that superficial views are very generally held and require to\r\nbe met:—\r\n\r\n_Extract from “The Patent Question under Free-Trade,” 1863._\r\n\r\nWe may now, in order to clear away what has been to some a\r\nstumbling-block—the argument from analogy founded on the case of literary\r\nproperty—notice certain distinctions between the subjects respectively\r\nof Patent-right and Copyright. Those things that belong to the province\r\nof Patent-right are in their nature capable of being independently\r\ndiscovered or originated, in the same identical form, by a plurality of\r\npersons. Of this character are the principles of mechanism, processes of\r\nmanufacture, and forms or methods accordant thereto. Such, indeed, are,\r\nas a rule, actually discovered or invented by several persons, and this\r\nvery often almost simultaneously. It is otherwise with things that belong\r\nto the province of Copyright—literary and artistic combinations, books,\r\npictures, musical compositions, involving any degree of elaboration.\r\nSuch, at no interval of time, have ever been produced by even one other\r\nperson except a copyist.\r\n\r\nThis ground for differential treatment is connected with others. In\r\nparticular, the literary or artistic compositions of any person are\r\nperfectly distinguishable from all those of every other. Hence the\r\nCopyright privilege is conceded in the absolute certainty that the\r\ngrantee is their true and only originator, or first producer or creator.\r\nNo second person can come forward, after the Copyright privilege is\r\nsecured to an author or artist, and allege that the poem or picture he\r\ncomposed also. To infringe Copyright means to slavishly or meanly copy\r\nthe work of another. To constitute infringement it is not sufficient\r\nthat the second person’s book has the same subject and the same purpose\r\nin view, and is written in the same spirit as the first; the “matter”\r\nmust be the same, and in the same form. And so with pictures, the\r\nsubjects may be the same; the ideas may show great correspondence.\r\n_Exactness_ of “matter” and of arrangement is everything. Patent-right,\r\non the contrary, may be infringed where there is no such exactness, and\r\nno copying whatever, but complete originality. Disregarding form, it\r\nforbids the embodiment and use of _ideas_, even of ideas entirely one’s\r\nown.\r\n\r\nWe have thus the inconsistency, or paradox, that the exclusive privileges\r\nwhich have for their province only material objects—which engage only our\r\nbodily frame and those senses merely that have their exercise on matter\r\napart from mind (and this is all that patentable inventions do)—carry\r\nprohibition into the region of ideas; while those other exclusive\r\nprivileges, in whose province matter serves only as a vehicle or excitant\r\nof things immaterial—conceptions, memories, tastes, emotions—and as an\r\ninstrument to set the mind a-working and affect the higher senses and\r\nfaculties—make no such incursions, keeping entirely clear of interference\r\nwith any man’s practical use of ideas.\r\n\r\nLiterary and artistic Copyright has for its province visible, tangible\r\nworks, intended only for the eye or the ear, or inner man through these\r\nsenses—objects to be looked upon, listened to, thought of; not things\r\nto be worked with or employed, nor things consumable, nor mere modes of\r\ndoing a thing, like the subjects of Patent-right. It has no regard to\r\nprocesses, operations, implements. Therefore, unlike Patent-right, it\r\ninterferes not with manufacturers, artisans, miners, farmers, shipping.\r\nIts sphere is in finished productions, works of art in their completed\r\nstate—objects that are permanent and unmistakable. Infringements,\r\ntherefore, are necessarily both manifest and of set purpose, whereas\r\ninfringements of Patent-right are often doubtful, even when the subjects\r\nor results can be exhibited, and when the facts of the case are\r\nassented to by all parties; and if it is a question of processes, its\r\ninfringements are often undetectable after the fleeting moment during\r\nwhich they are alleged to have taken place. Further, as before said,\r\ncontraventions of Patent-right may be, and not unfrequently are, done\r\nunconsciously or unwittingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMODIFICATIONS OF THE PATENT SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following paper on Patent Monopolies is reproduced from the\r\n_Liverpool Courier_, partly for the sake of presenting a past phase of\r\nopinion with respect to the means of mitigating the injurious influence\r\nof the exclusive privilege contained in Patents:—\r\n\r\nAt the Social Science Congress at Sheffield, in 1865, Mr. Macfie\r\nread a paper on the following subject: “Long Restrictions on the Use\r\nof Inventions, and Obligation to make heavy Payments to Patentees,\r\nincompatible with free and fair trade.” He said:—\r\n\r\nThat the inventor has a right of use or property in his invention we\r\ndo not dispute; what we dispute is his _exclusive_ right. To give one\r\ninventor such a right is to subvert the principle by denying the right\r\nof other inventors, who may be as original, and have worked as hard, and\r\nspent as much, but who, owing to a desire to perfect their achievement\r\na little more, or because they live in the provinces,—a day’s journey\r\nfurther off,—come some hours behind, and so are only second or third\r\napplicants for the coveted privilege. The State ought not, and cannot\r\nin strict justice, give a right of exclusive property; that is, power\r\nto meddle with others, and forbid them to use their valuable knowledge;\r\nexcept in cases where _common_ use and enjoyment would diminish public\r\nwealth or harm a previous possessor. If the land of England were\r\nconstituted common property, its productive value would be lessened,\r\nand the present possessors would be harmed; therefore, it legitimately\r\nis property. Knowledge may be, with the greatest benefits to mankind,\r\ncommon. God has drawn this distinction between things material or\r\nmeasurable (in which classification I include labour), and things mental:\r\nbetween land, ploughs, and the like, and the art or knowledge how to\r\nmanage or make them,—that the one cannot be appropriated, and the other\r\ncannot be unappropriated, without loss to our race. _En passant_, do we\r\nconform to the spirit this constitution of nature may be held to commend\r\nto man?\r\n\r\nI will not detain you by controverting the arguments of those plausible\r\nreasoners who class Patent-right with Copyright. Both, indeed, are\r\ncreations of enacting law. But there is this obvious and broad\r\ndistinction between them: that to grant exclusive privileges to an\r\nauthor interferes with nobody else’s compositions, whereas to grant them\r\nto an inventor continually conflicts with what others have done and are\r\ndoing. Nor shall we spend time in discussing the _merits_ of inventors.\r\nThese, we allow, may be great, and deserve public acknowledgment. What\r\nought rather to be discussed is the _kind_ of acknowledgment that is\r\nmost expedient. At present a very primitive mode of rewarding inventors\r\nis alone the rule—monopoly. In old times, when political economy, like\r\nthe other sciences, was unknown, it was the easy, but at the same time\r\ncostly, way of endowing a court favourite to grant him an exclusive right\r\nto sell or make some commodity. When, in the beginning of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, all other monopolies were prohibited by law, those in favour\r\nof introducers of _new manufactures_ were spared. This exception has\r\nbeen found or made so expansible, that it is ruled to extend to minute\r\nprocesses or instruments in existing trades, so that what was intended to\r\npromote manufactures is now too frequently a hindrance. Thus the avowed\r\nobject of the exception, public good, is on the whole counteracted. What\r\nwe maintain is, that, admitting the monopoly attains to some extent that\r\nobject, the disadvantages preponderate over the advantages. We connect\r\nthis charge with another which is still more condemnatory, viz., that\r\nthese advantages, limited as they are, are obtained by compromise of\r\nsound principle and by positive acts of unfairness, such as cannot be\r\nalleged against our view of the case, which is, that these exclusive\r\nprivileges should be abolished.\r\n\r\nThe title of this paper says almost all I care to occupy your valuable\r\ntime with. It speaks of _restrictions_ in the use of inventions. Patents\r\nimpose restrictions, nay, prohibitions. They give an absolute monopoly.\r\nNobody but a patentee has a right to use a patented invention. It speaks\r\nof _long_ restrictions. Patents impose their restrictions, or rather\r\nprohibitions, for the long period of fourteen years, with occasional\r\nprolongations of the term. To be denied the use of an invention for such\r\na length of time is, now-a-days (whatever it may have been of yore),\r\nmuch like being denied it altogether. The title speaks of _payments_ to\r\npatentees. These are made in all cases where the patentee allows others\r\nto use his invention. It speaks of _heavy_ payments, because he has the\r\nright to make them heavy, and he, in practice, makes them as heavy as he\r\ncan. It speaks of an _obligation_, and rightly, because a manufacturer\r\nwho uses a patented invention is under the necessity to pay whatever\r\nthe patentee demands or a jury awards, and competition may frequently\r\ncompel him to use it, under penalty of losing his profits of trade,\r\nor his trade itself. It speaks of the payees as _patentees_, not as\r\ninventors; because in many cases (how large a proportion I cannot say)\r\nthe rights are conferred on mere importers or appropriators of other\r\npeople’s inventions. The title further speaks of _free-trade_. This\r\nfreedom, which is something different from mere _libre échange_, ought to\r\nextend to manufacturing and all kind of labour, as well as to commerce,\r\nfor, according to the great lexicographer, trade is “employment, whether\r\n_manual_ or mercantile.” Of course it does not so extend when labour\r\nis not free, but restricted and burdened. And it speaks of _fair_\r\ntrade—fairness is about as important as freedom. Will anybody say it is\r\nfair to tax one manufacturer and let another go free? Yet this is what\r\nPatents do. Those whom the patentee favours, or fears, or forgets, he\r\ndoes not tax, or taxes lightly, while on others he lays a heavy hand.\r\nBut, worst of all, under the open competition to which the British\r\nmanufacturer is now exposed with all the world, he often has to pay\r\nheavy Patent fees—often four, and sometimes, as I know, five, and even\r\nsix, figures deep—while his foreign rivals wholly escape. How can any\r\nstatesman, or member of a Chamber of Commerce, defend or palliate such\r\ngross and grievous inequalities? Unfortunately, the start that the United\r\nKingdom has got in manufactures and shipping has done much to blind us,\r\nand keep us from seeing the strides that neighbouring nations are making,\r\nand has emboldened our legislators and financiers to make treaties,\r\nin which we consent, as a nation, to run the race of manufacturing\r\nindustry weighted. The wise will call this _im_policy, perhaps _conceit_.\r\nLet us not deceive ourselves; peculiar burdens on British traders\r\nare incompatible with free-trade; more, and worse, they are flagrant\r\ninconsistencies, subversive of our character for good sense, incompatible\r\nwith reasonable ground for expecting manufacturing prosperity. The cry\r\nand principle so popular this day is belied when there is not a fair\r\nfield, and there is the opposite of favour. The cause of all these\r\nevils and wrongs is the sticking to the exploded and illogical system\r\nof monopoly, as if that were the best, instead of being, as we believe,\r\nthe very worst form in which acknowledgment can be made. We say enough\r\nin condemnation when we characterise it as _despotic_, inasmuch as it\r\nhands over British manufacturers, absolutely and without appeal, to the\r\nexactions or prohibitions of patentees and assignees of Patents; as\r\n_erratic_, inasmuch as in one case it occasions not gain but loss to the\r\nfavourite, in another it overpowers with enormous profit, frequently the\r\nill-luck falling to the most ingenious, and the extravagant remuneration\r\nto men of slender claims; as _retarding_, inasmuch as it often causes\r\ngreat delay in the introducing of inventions into use; as _preposterous_,\r\ninasmuch as it hinders the perfecting of new inventions by preventing\r\nthe combination of the further improvements that others than the patentee\r\ndevise or might devise; as _illogical_, in this among other respects,\r\nthat through the far larger share which capitalists or purchasers of\r\nPatents often get beyond the pittance that may or may not reach the poor\r\ninventor, its action is but indirect and small compared with its cost\r\nas a means of rewarding and stimulating inventors; as _inquisitorial_,\r\nfor it justifies the hiring of informers to report who and where are\r\ninfringers; as _unnatural_, for it takes away a person’s attention from\r\nhis own legitimate business, and divides it with the businesses of other\r\npeople whom he must watch or teach; as _cruel_, for the unhappy patentee\r\nis continually liable to be engaged in costly, often ruinous law pleas,\r\nfar away from home, in order to establish the validity of his Patent and\r\nto prevent infringements; as _extravagant_, because it gives patentees,\r\nor rather costs the public (for it is but a small proportion of the\r\nburden imposed that is the nett profit of the patentee) much more than a\r\nbetter system would. It is also _partial_, as has been stated, for its\r\nincidence is not equal on all British manufacturers, and it inflicts on\r\nthem the hardship of peculiar burdens not borne by rivals abroad; and in\r\nthis respect, as in the rest, it is _irremediable_, for equal treatment\r\nis morally impossible at home and abroad. It is quite out of the question\r\nto expect rectifying amendment in this particular, seeing only some\r\nStates grant Patents at all. Among those which do, some grant sparingly\r\nor only to their own inhabitants; and to take Patents in all places where\r\nthey are granted would involve the command and risking of so very much\r\ncapital that few indeed, if ever any, would embrace the whole field;\r\nand, if perchance they did, the labour of superintending a business so\r\nvast, in languages so diverse and many, would require superhuman powers.\r\nThe right to demand “compulsory licences” as a mitigation was suggested\r\nat the Liverpool Congress. They would be an improvement, and should be\r\npracticable, seeing something of that nature exists elsewhere, although\r\nthe Royal Commission has reported against the plan. But it would be a\r\nserious mistake to anticipate from their adoption as a reform any very\r\nimportant relief. I hope it is possible to propose some substitute which\r\nwill not be liable to these reproaches, one which will give rewards\r\nhaving proportion to merit, which will give them within a reasonable\r\nperiod, which will entail little trouble or distraction on the nation’s\r\nassumed protégé, the inventor; one which, being regulated by fixed\r\nprinciples and controlled by officers who will sift the wheat from the\r\nchaff, will satisfy the yearnings after awards having some proportion to\r\nmerit, which now are disregarded; and which, above all, will elevate\r\nthe inventor from what you will surely allow me to call his present\r\nequivocal position—that involves little or no honour, and too generally\r\nsomething approaching the very reverse—to a position that implies merit\r\nand gives status. I do not speak of mere honours, whether in the form of\r\ncertificates or medals, or trifles, although all of these I recommend.\r\nWhat I have submitted already to the association, in a paper to be found\r\nin the Edinburgh volume, I repeat as still in my opinion practicable and\r\nexpedient—viz., to grant national rewards in money. I would allow these\r\nto be claimed immediately after inventions are specified. It would be\r\nthe duty of a competent board, after due consultation and inquiries, to\r\naward each a fair sum, within certain limits, such as prudence, combined\r\nwith liberality, would prescribe for their regulation. Or, the patentee\r\nmight prefer postponement of the adjudication for three years. This\r\nshould be allowed, or even encouraged, in order that time may be gained\r\nfor practical expression of the benefit conferred by actual use of the\r\ninvention. In that case, the reward should be ampler.\r\n\r\nThis system, I am persuaded, would be found in practice much less\r\nexpensive to the nation than the present system. So slight are the merits\r\nof the majority of Patents that the State would have comparatively\r\nlittle to pay; but the relief to manufacturers and the gain to commerce\r\nwould be very great; for, however unprofitable a Patent is, it may be\r\nvery effectual as a restraint and a burden. Such a system would sweep\r\naway every hindrance to the immediate enjoyment by every one of every\r\ninvention, and to the combining with it every cognate improvement; a\r\ngreat emancipation and stimulus would at once be felt to operate. If\r\nother nations adhere to the antiquated Patent system which they have\r\nborrowed from us, we would be happily invested, in competition with them,\r\nwith the immense advantage which the Swiss, for instance, enjoy over\r\ntheir rivals, that of being free from Patents, yet knowing the inventions\r\nof all other nations. But they would not adhere; on the contrary, they\r\nwould either totally free themselves from the encumbrance, and leave\r\nus to pay the rewards, or (and this is more probable and would be more\r\nhonourable) they would join in international arrangements, in virtue\r\nof which, every State contributing a little, inventors would receive\r\nlarge emolument, and trades would rejoice with them in the advent of an\r\ninvention millennium, in the bliss of which workmen would share,—on whose\r\ninterests, by preventing them from benefiting by use of the knowledge\r\nthey acquire, Patents, I apprehend, act unfavourably.\r\n\r\nI am aware that to persuade Government and Parliament to adopt national\r\ngrants would involve indefinite, perhaps long, postponement of the happy\r\nyear of release. Therefore I repeat another proposition, also already\r\nsubmitted to you. It is this: To grant Patents much as heretofore (not\r\nresisting any reformation that may appear expedient); but to enact\r\nthat, on the demand of any manufacturer, after three years of monopoly,\r\nany invention may be valued—not, of course, on the basis of the return\r\nwhich it might bring—but on that of its originality, the cost incurred\r\nin working it out, its advantage, &c., whereupon it shall be lawful\r\nfor a Patent Board to extinguish the grant in any of the following\r\ncircumstances: 1. If the patentee’s books (which he should be obliged\r\nto keep in all cases where his fees from any individual exceed £100 per\r\nannum) show that he has already received in fees the valuation price. 2.\r\nIf manufacturers and others interested unitedly pay as much as will make\r\nthe price up. 3. If the State pay the remainder of the price, purchasing\r\nthe invention for the nation. And I would include a condition that any\r\none may obtain exemption for himself or his firm, by paying, say, a tenth\r\nof the price.\r\n\r\nAnd now, a kind word to the amphibious class of persons whom we style\r\ninventors (we are most of us inventors, more or less, in some form or\r\nother). Try to meet the legitimate demands of manufacturers; act in\r\nconsonance with the spirit of the age and the requirements of the time;\r\nand remember how, by resisting conciliatory propositions, the great\r\nagricultural, sugar-producing, and shipowning interests had to succumb to\r\nenlightened doctrines, and accept a settlement far less accordant with\r\ntheir pretensions. Manufacturers (with whom, as in like manner liable\r\nto be affected, I class miners, farmers, shipowners, &c.) who employ\r\ninventions in their businesses on a right system, ought not to regard the\r\npatentee, still less the inventor, as an intruder and an obstacle in his\r\npath. Yet that they in general do so regard these reputed benefactors\r\nand auxiliaries is, I fear, too true. It is the fault of the system. Let\r\nus be well disposed to a better, in which the interests and feelings of\r\nboth sides—for opposite sides they appear to be—shall harmonise. Either\r\nof the plans I sketch would, partially at least, bring them into unison.\r\nThe only objection that I anticipate is that the amount to be received\r\nwill not reach the often, it must be admitted, extremely high ideas of\r\ninventors. In so far as this objection is well founded, in consequence\r\nof the rare merit of any particular invention—a case that does not arise\r\nevery year—it can be met by special votes, which I would be far from\r\nexcluding.\r\n\r\nIt may be regretted that the investigations of the recent Royal\r\nCommission to inquire into this subject (most significant against the\r\npresent system is their report) were not more extensive and radical. This\r\narose from the purposely defective terms of appointment. The Liverpool\r\nChamber of Commerce has consequently asked Government, through the Board\r\nof Trade (that department calculated to be so very useful, but somehow\r\nin these days jostled aside, and scarcely seen or heard of in deeds),\r\nto appoint a fresh commission which shall inquire into the _policy_ of\r\nPatents. This request has had the honour of public endorsement (either\r\nin that form or in the form of a Parliamentary Committee) by no less\r\nan authority than the Right Hon. Chairman of the Commission, who also\r\nstated to the House the remarkable and most encouraging fact, that doubts\r\nlike his own had sprung up in the mind of that eminent lawyer, Sir\r\nHugh Cairns, the very member who, almost in opposition to the late Mr.\r\nRicardo, a decided opponent of the monopoly, moved the address to the\r\nCrown for the Commission. On the other side of the Speaker’s chair we\r\nhave law officers of the Crown, if I mistake not, impressed with the same\r\ndislike, and among the Radicals we know that equally opposed were Mr.\r\nBright and the late pure and noble patriot Mr. Cobden. It is within my\r\nown observation that candid inquirers, preimpressed though they may be in\r\nfavour of inventors’ claims and monopolies, reach the same conclusion. As\r\nto the Continent, M. Chevalier, Swiss statesmen officially consulted, and\r\nthe German Congress of Political Economists, have strongly declared that\r\nthey are utterly opposed. The Social Science Association can, and I hope\r\nwill, as in the past so in the future, lend important aid to the cause.\r\nNobody is better fitted to reconcile those interests that unnecessarily\r\nconflict, and to emancipate productive industry from trammels so hard to\r\nbear, while also promoting invention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reader is also referred to the following lapsed\r\n\r\n_Scheme submitted to the International Association for the Progress of\r\nthe Social Sciences at Brussels in 1863._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The principal States of Europe and America, with their colonies, to\r\nunite and form a Patent Union.\r\n\r\n2. Every capital to have a State Patent-office, in correspondence with\r\nthe offices in the other capitals.\r\n\r\n3. Every invention patented in one of these offices to be protected in\r\nall the associated States.\r\n\r\n4. Each State’s Patent-office to receive copies of Patent specifications\r\nlodged in the Patent-office of every other State, and to translate and\r\npublish within its own territories.\r\n\r\n5. The Patent to confer exclusive privileges for three years.\r\n\r\n6. With these privileges is conjoined the right of granting licences.\r\n\r\n7. An agent or assignee, fully empowered to negotiate for the patentee,\r\nmust reside in each State.\r\n\r\n8. Commissioners shall appraise each invention at the end of the second\r\nor third year (or later, if deemed advisable).\r\n\r\n9. In estimating the value, the Commissioners shall be entitled to claim\r\nthe advice of practical men, and may take into view all circumstances\r\naffecting value—such as the originality of the invention, and its\r\nimportance; the probability of its being soon made by another; the\r\nexpense and hazard of preliminary experiments and trials; the benefit it\r\nis calculated to confer; the gain which use and licences during the three\r\nyears will bring the patentee.\r\n\r\n10. If the patentee resign his monopoly before its term expires, this\r\nconcession to the public shall be regarded in the price.\r\n\r\n11. The Commissioners shall adjudicate in what proportions each State\r\nshall pay the price fixed, on the basis of population, revenue, or\r\ncommerce.\r\n\r\n12. They may recommend a further grant, as an _honorarium_, in special\r\ninstances of singular merit.\r\n\r\n13. Their valuation and grants must be framed on the basis of a total\r\nyearly expenditure on inventions of not more than one million pounds\r\nsterling at the utmost, from all countries of the union, of which sum,\r\nhowever, no one country can be called upon for more than £100,000 in one\r\nyear, nor more than £1,000 for one invention.\r\n\r\n14. The Commissioners shall be entitled to recommend for honorary medals,\r\nribbons, or certificates, real inventors of strong claims, especially\r\nsuch as voluntarily shorten, or never exercise, the exclusive use of\r\nimportant inventions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOPINIONS OF THE PRESS ON THE DEBATE IN PARLIAMENT ON THE PATENT QUESTION.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Leading Article from the “Times,” May 29, 1869._\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic attention has for some little time been withdrawn from the\r\nconsideration of the Patent-Laws; but, if we may judge from the\r\ndiscussion upon the subject in the House of Commons last night, the day\r\nis at hand when this branch of our legislation will be wiped out of the\r\nstatute-book. It is impossible to withstand the weight of authority\r\nand reason advanced yesterday. It was all on one side. Mr. Macfie, the\r\nnewly-elected member for Leith, introduced the subject, and, incited\r\napparently by injuries he had himself suffered through the operation of\r\nthe Patent-Laws, argued very vigorously against them on theoretical and\r\npractical grounds. He was not left unsupported. Sir Roundell Palmer,\r\nwho, had he consulted his private interest, would certainly have been\r\namong the first to uphold a system productive of such immense pecuniary\r\nbenefits to the practitioners in the courts, seconded Mr. Macfie’s\r\nmotion for the unconditional abolition of the Patent-Laws in a speech\r\nof the closest reasoning, supported by a vast array of facts which\r\nhad come within his own personal experience. He was followed by Lord\r\nStanley, who confessed that, against all his early prepossessions, he\r\nhad been convinced, when acting as Chairman of the Patent Commission,\r\nthat the abolition of the Patent-Laws was demanded on grounds of justice\r\nand of sound policy. Two of the foremost representatives of law and\r\nof statesmanship thus enforced the reform demanded by Mr. Macfie as\r\na spokesman for manufacturers. It is true that others followed who\r\nopposed, or attempted to oppose, the arguments of Sir Roundell Palmer\r\nand Lord Stanley. This was inevitable. Men who have not looked into\r\nthe question are in the same position as Lord Stanley says he himself\r\nwas when he first began to consider it. They are under the influence\r\nof impressions they have never thought of questioning, and are biased\r\nby supposed analogies, drawn from cognate subjects, the unsoundness\r\nof which they have not investigated. Hence they protest, not without\r\nvehemence, against an amendment of the law which is in conflict with\r\ntheir own habits of thought, but they do not reason upon it. Analyse the\r\nspeeches delivered last night by Mr. Howard, Mr. Mundella, and, we must\r\nadd, the Attorney-General, and the residuum of argument contained in\r\nthem will be found to be very small indeed. They are all satisfied the\r\nPatent-Laws have been useful to the nation, as people were once satisfied\r\nthat the Corn-law was the secret of our greatness. They insisted\r\nthat the abolition of the Patent-Laws would be a blow to our national\r\npre-eminence, just as their predecessors agreed in predicting not so long\r\nago that with the abolition of the Corn-laws Old England would dwindle\r\nand decay.\r\n\r\nThe first point to be borne in mind with reference to the Patent-Laws\r\nis, that if we retain them at all they must be retained in their present\r\nform. The amendments admissible in their machinery are not important,\r\nand the recommendations of the Royal Commission some years ago were\r\nso slight that it has never been thought necessary to carry them into\r\neffect. What is the scheme of the Patent-Laws? A man discovers, or\r\nbelieves he discovers, a new process of accomplishing some useful result.\r\nHe registers his supposed invention, and acquires a provisional right\r\nto its exclusive use for a definite number of years. After a time he\r\nfinds some other person using his invention, and applies to the courts\r\nof law to prohibit him. The alleged infringer of the Patent says that\r\nthe assumed discovery was no discovery at all, or that it was of no\r\npublic benefit, or that he is not making use of it, and the questions\r\narising on these issues are then tried. This is a condensed statement\r\nof the whole working of the law as it stands. No substitute for it can\r\nbe recommended that will bear examination. It is sometimes said that an\r\ninventor should be required to prove the originality and utility of his\r\ninvention at the time he makes his application to be registered. But who\r\ncould examine such a claim? A court of law may, after much trouble and\r\ncaution, declare that a claimant is entitled to a piece of land, because\r\nthe claimant, by exercising rights of ownership over it, gives notice in\r\na very palpable way to all other claimants of the property, though even\r\nthen the court takes extreme pains that the rights of absent or infant\r\npersons may not be abridged. But, when a man claims an invention, by\r\nwhat possible process could notice of his claim be brought home to every\r\nman in the kingdom? Whoever will consider the matter will be forced to\r\nthe conclusion that all the State can do is to tell an applicant that\r\nhe shall be protected in the use of his invention provided he shall be\r\nable, whenever occasion arises, to establish its originality and utility\r\nagainst any one who may arise to contest them. The same considerations\r\nwhich negative the suggestion that a claimant could receive an\r\nindefeasible title, also negative the proposal that the claimant should\r\nbe compensated by a money grant at the outset. If the originality of his\r\nclaim cannot be proved, payment for it cannot be made, even if there\r\nexisted at that incipient stage any means of determining its value.\r\n\r\nThe present system of Patents must be retained if Patents are to be\r\npreserved, and the evils of the system flow directly from it. It is\r\nimpossible to diminish appreciably the litigation attendant on Patents.\r\nSir Roundell Palmer referred to the paraffin oil case, which occupied\r\nthe Court of Chancery fifteen days. Nor could this be avoided, for the\r\nnovelty of the process of distilling paraffin was the point contested,\r\nand to decide this it was necessary to examine the exact stage of\r\ndiscovery to which a dozen different investigators had advanced, all of\r\nwhom were trying simultaneously, but independently of each other, to\r\ndistil paraffin oil so as to make it a commercial product. The expense\r\nand uncertainty of Patent litigation being unavoidable, the cardinal\r\ndefect of the system, that the reward it offers hardly ever goes to\r\nthe right man, follows. The inventor is at one end of the scale; the\r\ntransferee or licensee of the Patent is at the other, and while the\r\nlatter reaps enormous gains, the inventor often has the reflection that\r\nit was he who made the discovery for his sole reward. The second great\r\nfault of the system of the Patent-Laws is an effect equally inseparable\r\nfrom it. These laws constantly inflict the most grievous injustice on\r\ninnocent persons. Mechanical and chemical discoveries are not made\r\nby unconnected jumps. The history of science and of invention is one\r\nof gradual progress. A hundred different persons are pursuing their\r\ninvestigations on the same subject independently of each other, and\r\nare all nearing a particular goal, when some one man reaches it a few\r\ndays before the others. The law which gives him a monopoly denies to\r\nthe rest the fruit of their exertions. It is needless to refer to the\r\nnumberless instances in which inventions have been discovered so nearly\r\nsimultaneously that the real inventor cannot be ascertained; and it is\r\nimpossible to deny that to give a monopoly to the man who is the most\r\nprompt to register his claim often inflicts a grievous wrong on the\r\ninvestigators who accomplish the same results in perfect independence of\r\nhim. So far we have spoken only of primary discoveries. The secondary\r\nPatents, as they may be called, were rightly denominated by Sir Roundell\r\nPalmer unmitigated evils, and, according to the same high authority, they\r\nexceed in number Patents of importance in the ratio of a hundred to one.\r\nA person suggests some small improvement in the course of an elaborate\r\nmanufacture, and takes out a Patent for it. Henceforth he blocks the\r\nwhole trade. He cannot be got rid of, and it is not easy to deal with\r\nhim. He is quite conscious of the obstacle he creates, and in the end\r\nhe is probably bought off by some great manufacturer in the line of\r\nbusiness affected by the discovery, who, by accumulating in his hands\r\nthe inventions, good and bad, connected with his occupation, monopolises\r\nthat particular branch of trade throughout the country.\r\n\r\nThe strength of the existing Patent-Laws lies in the vague belief of\r\nthose who have not considered the subject that it would be unjust\r\nto deprive a man of the benefit of his discoveries. Those who are\r\nimpressed with this elementary notion may be asked to reconcile it\r\nwith the undeniable fact that the Patent-Laws do deprive, in the way\r\nwe have shown, many men of the benefit of their discoveries; but a\r\nlittle reflection will convince them that their argument rests on a pure\r\nassumption. No man would be deprived of the benefit of his discovery\r\nbecause he did not receive a monopoly of its use. His own discovery\r\nwould be his own discovery still. As long as he is allowed to employ his\r\nown inventions in any way he thinks proper he cannot be said to suffer\r\nany deprivation of a right. The truth is, that the Patent-Laws are a\r\nvoluntary addition to our legislation based upon no such obligation as\r\nunderlies the ordinary laws of property; and they must be justified, if\r\nthey can be justified at all, as gratuitous creations of the Legislature,\r\nby proof that they produce some national benefit. It is from this point\r\nof view that we see the difference between the laws of Copyright and of\r\nPatents. They agree in being added on to what may be called the body\r\nof natural law, but the reasons in support of each are not the same,\r\nand the objections which apply to the law of Patents do not apply to\r\nthe law of Copyright. The monopoly granted to an author does injustice\r\nto no one. The monopolies granted to patentees do injustice to many.\r\nPatents are creations of positive law, and must be judged accordingly.\r\nThe Attorney-General approves them because they are designed to multiply\r\ninventions, although he admits that the multiplication of Patents is a\r\nserious evil. A sounder judgment will condemn them because of the evils\r\nnecessarily attendant upon them; and we have no fear of what would happen\r\nto the course of invention or the progress of the country if they were\r\nabolished, and the inventor allowed to make such use of his invention as\r\nhe may be advised. Inventions co-exist with Patents, but the experience\r\nof Switzerland is sufficient to show that they would abound if Patents\r\ndid not exist, and the decline of commercial greatness with which Mr.\r\nHoward threatens us should Patents be abolished may be treated like so\r\nmany other prophecies of evil which have been happily neglected and\r\nremain unfulfilled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Leading Article from the “Economist,” June 5, 1869._\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is probable enough that the Patent-Laws will be abolished ere long,\r\nthough the full force of the real objections to them was perhaps not\r\nbrought out in the debate last week on Mr. Macfie’s motion for their\r\nabolition. Sir Roundell Palmer was too metaphysical. The supposed\r\ndistinction between the copyright of a book and a Patent—that no two men\r\nwill hit upon the same composition even in substance, while they will\r\nhit upon the same idea for an invention—does not prove anything. If a\r\ncase of general utility could be made out, the abstract justice of giving\r\na man the monopoly of an idea, should he be the first to come upon it,\r\nwould not be much considered. Lord Stanley, who avoided this mistake,\r\ndwelt too much upon such minor points as the practical failure of the\r\nlaw to secure a reward to the inventor and the frequent disproportion\r\nbetween the reward and the service rendered, which are points of _no_\r\nconsequence so long as the public is generally a gainer by the law. Lord\r\nStanley, however, touched upon the true reason when he referred to the\r\ninjury of third parties, which the present law occasions, by reason of\r\nPatents being granted to only one out of half-a-dozen persons who come\r\nupon the same inventions, or to one of a series of inventors who improve\r\nupon each other’s work, and by reason also of the general interference\r\nwith manufacturing. What we should have liked to see fully stated was the\r\npeculiarity of the present circumstances of the country in which these\r\nthings are true. The statements in fact amount to this—that there is a\r\nlarge number of inventions which Patents are not required to encourage;\r\nthat these are made as ordinary incidents of business; that invention,\r\nimprovement of mechanical and chemical processes, is itself a part of a\r\nmanufacturing business; and that in this way the granting of Patents only\r\nimpedes manufacturers to whom inventions would naturally come. The full\r\nforce of these facts cannot be felt unless we recognise that a change in\r\nthe character of invention has taken place. The Patent-Laws were intended\r\nto apply to different manufacturing circumstances from those which\r\nnow exist, and were based upon different notions about invention; the\r\nobjection to them is that they either are, or are becoming, out of date.\r\nA little consideration will show how true this is.\r\n\r\nLet us look first at the notions still customary about inventors and\r\ninventions which are derived from past circumstances. The popular idea of\r\nan inventor is of a man who makes an immense addition to the real wealth\r\nof the world—who invents the steam engine, or the spinning jenny, or the\r\nJacquard loom, or the hot blast—almost revolutionising the material\r\npowers of mankind. The idea associated with his work is in any case that\r\nof great novelty in means coupled with great accomplished results. Now\r\nthere are various reasons why these should not be the characteristics of\r\nmodern inventors and inventions, as we see they are not. It might be true\r\nthat there are still as many inventions of real novelty and magnitude as\r\never, though we doubt if there is; and yet there would be circumstances\r\nwhich prevented a legislator regarding them as most important. One of\r\nthese circumstances is certainly the exaggerated importance of minor\r\nimprovements, in consequence of the great development of machinery\r\nand manufacturing. A single improvement to save 10 per cent, in fuel\r\nfor the steam engine would probably add more absolutely to the real\r\nwealth of this generation than the invention of the steam-engine itself\r\nadded to the real wealth of the generation in which it was invented. A\r\nrecent invention just spoken of—the feathering of the blades of screws,\r\nincreasing the facilities of using auxiliary steam-power in ships—might\r\ncompare on the same footing with the most substantial invention of a\r\npoorer age. Just as the refinement of the machinery of credit, and the\r\nextent of its development, cause the least disturbance to be widely felt,\r\nso the least improvement in mechanical or chemical knowledge, applied to\r\nmanufactures, may have great results. A revolutionary invention—owing to\r\nthe difficulty of introduction—might not tell so quickly even as a minor\r\nimprovement in an existing groove; but, in any case its effects will now\r\nbe matched at the first start by these minor improvements.\r\n\r\nThese improvements again, as well as the great inventions themselves,\r\nare usually come at in recent times in a different way from that of the\r\nold inventor. Formerly the inventor had almost nothing, before him—every\r\ndepartment of industry had to be built up from the foundation. Now a\r\nman must build upon extensive knowledge of what has been accomplished,\r\nand must have great means at his command. What Mr. Mill has just been\r\nexplaining in his new book in regard to original authorship in the\r\npresent day is equally true of invention: “Nearly all the thoughts which\r\ncan be reached by mere strength of original faculties have long since\r\nbeen arrived at; and originality, in any high sense of the word, is\r\nnow scarcely ever attained but by minds which have undergone elaborate\r\ndiscipline, and are deeply versed in the results of previous thinking.\r\nIt is Mr. Maurice, I think, who has remarked, on the present age, that\r\nits most original thinkers are those who have known most thoroughly what\r\nhad been thought by their predecessors; and this will henceforth be the\r\ncase. Every fresh stone in the edifice has now to be placed on the top\r\nof so many others, that a long process of climbing, and of carrying up\r\nmaterials, has to be gone through by whoever aspires to take a share in\r\nthe present stage of the work.” That is—when we speak of invention—the\r\ninventor must be a man who is closely associated with capitalists,\r\nor be a capitalist himself. In no other way can he have the means of\r\nknowing the thousand improvements of machinery and processes which have\r\nculminated in the present factories and machines; and in no other way\r\ncan he find means for experiments on the necessary scale. “Poor men,”\r\nsays Sir William Armstrong, “very often come to me imagining that they\r\nhave made some great discovery. It is generally all moonshine, or if it\r\nlooks feasible, it is impossible to pronounce upon its value until it has\r\npassed through that stage of preliminary investigation which involves all\r\nthe labour, and all the difficulty, and all the trouble.” How is a poor\r\nman to get this preliminary investigation undertaken, when the subject\r\nis an amendment of a complicated manufacturing process? The complaint,\r\nin fact, was made before the Select Committee on Technical Instruction,\r\nthat English manufacturing was suffering from foreign competition,\r\nbecause there is less room now than formerly for the play of “untaught\r\ninvention.” The machine is too perfect for the workman to meddle with;\r\nand thus the foreigner, supposed to be more technically instructed, has\r\nroom to excel us—our peculiar power having been “untaught invention.”\r\n\r\nSuch having been the change in the character of invention, it is easy to\r\nsee why the Patent-Laws are not only not needed, but are obstructive.\r\nThe inventor, in the first place, is not in the position of an old\r\ninventor. To give him scope he must be employed by a manufacturer\r\nor capitalist—that is, his skill must be already highly valued, the\r\nmanufacturer naturally employing those who can introduce amendments\r\nand improvements, and keep him abreast or ahead of competitors. “I\r\nbelieve,” says Sir William Armstrong, again, “that if you let the whole\r\nthing alone, the position which a man attains, the introduction and the\r\nprestige, and the natural advantages which result from a successful\r\ninvention and from the reputation which he gains as a clever and able\r\nman, will almost always bring with them a sufficient reward.” And again:\r\n“I think that absolute discoveries are very rare things; nearly all\r\ninventions are the result of an improvement built up upon a preceding\r\none. A poor man who has the ability to make really practical improvements\r\nis almost sure to rise in the world without the aid of Patents.” And if\r\nthe inventor may be thus indifferent to a Patent-Law, the question as\r\nto the inducement to capitalists to take up inventions may be settled\r\nby their general objection to Patents. Though there are one or two\r\nmanufacturers who have monopolised a number of Patents in their trade,\r\nand so turned the law to account, it is from them that the greatest\r\ncomplaints come—men like Mr. Platt, or Mr. Scott Russell, or Mr. Macfie,\r\nwho has just moved the abolition of the laws. The truth is, capitalists\r\nare now in a position to obtain a profit without a Patent—just as they\r\ncan sometimes disregard a Patent for a long time till competition forces\r\nit upon them. Patents, then, are not required as an inducement either to\r\ninventors or capitalists, and the reason of the law fails.\r\n\r\nBut this is not all. The complaint of manufacturers at the obstruction of\r\nthe present law would not be enough by itself, but it is a very serious\r\nmatter when invention is part of the business of manufacturing. The law\r\nof Patents, in short, interferes with what has become the normal process\r\nof invention. Mr. Platt states: “I think that there is scarcely a week,\r\ncertainly not a month, that passes but what we have a notice of some\r\nkind or other of things that we have never heard of in any way, and do\r\nnot know of in the least that we are infringing upon them.” Sir William\r\nArmstrong complains of a personal grievance: “The necessity which I am\r\nunder of taking out Patents, not for the purpose of obtaining for myself\r\na monopoly, but simply for the purpose of preventing other persons from\r\nexcluding me from my own inventions.” And much similar evidence was given\r\nbefore the Royal Commission, of which Lord Stanley was chairman. Thus the\r\npresent law is not wanted to promote invention, and it is injurious to a\r\nkind of invention which would go on luxuriantly without it. The gradual\r\nnature of most inventions is a sufficient security that it will proceed\r\nunder the law of competition. Perhaps the practice of Government is the\r\nbest indication of the necessity for the abolition of Patents. A few\r\nyears ago the manufacturing departments of Government found themselves\r\nso hampered by Patents that they resolved to try whether they were bound\r\nor not, the result being a legal opinion that they were not bound. But\r\nGovernment is only a great manufacturer, its work in some departments\r\nbeing less than in many private businesses. Is there any reason why\r\nGovernment should be released, and individuals bound to patentees? As\r\nto the supposition that invention will cease, the mere interest of the\r\nGovernment in paying for anything worth having is found a sufficient\r\nstimulus to invention in the things which it requires; and so it is\r\nassumed will be the interest of competing manufacturers.\r\n\r\nThere is a universal agreement, moreover, that no Patent-Law should\r\ncover all the inventions which are now covered. It happens that the\r\nstrongest condemnation of things as they are before the Royal Commission\r\ncame from witnesses who wished a change, though none suggested anything\r\nwhich commended itself to the Commission. The idea seemed to be that\r\na separation could be made between substantial inventions and the\r\nimprovements or amendments which are now so important, but are admitted\r\nto be unsuitable for Patents. It was thought that Patents, instead of\r\nbeing granted indiscriminately, should only be granted in cases of proved\r\nnovelty and utility. But no working plan of a court to do this could be\r\ndevised, or one which would not probably discourage inventors as much as\r\nthe abolition of Patents altogether.\r\n\r\nWe come, then, to the conclusion that it is for the general interest\r\nthat Patent-Laws should be abolished, and that their abolition will do\r\nno great harm to any one—least of all, to the great mass of inventors or\r\nimprovers. Perhaps we may point out that, if the circumstances are as\r\ndescribed, this country has a special interest in abolishing such laws.\r\nAs the leading manufacturing country in the world, a Patent here is\r\nlikely to be worth more to its holder than anywhere else; consequently\r\nour manufacturers are more exposed than any others to the interruption\r\nand worry of Patents. It may well be that other countries which are less\r\ntempting to patentees will find the balance of competition weighted\r\nin their favour in consequence. Looked at another way, the more that\r\ninvention falls into the hands of great capitalists, the more likely is\r\nit to strengthen the manufacturing of a country which is already most\r\npowerful. The normal condition of things is all in our favour, and we\r\nshould do nothing to thwart it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Leading Article from the “Spectator,” June 5, 1869._\r\n\r\n\r\nThose who doubt whether there are subjects upon which no conclusion is\r\npossible, which baffle the ablest and most judicial minds possessing\r\nthe best attainable information, should read the debate which has just\r\ntaken place on the proposed abolition of the Patent Laws. The most\r\nremarkable fact of the debate was the uncompromising attack upon these\r\nlaws by Sir Roundell Palmer, his eager advocacy of the opinion that they\r\nshould be at once abolished; but the most significant speech was made\r\nby Lord Stanley, who exhibited perfectly the incapacity of reasonable\r\nmen to come to a wholly satisfactory judgment upon them. In fact, there\r\nis a real balance of considerations which were almost exhaustively\r\nstated by Lord Stanley. If you look at one set of facts, you see good\r\nreason for conceding Patent rights; if you look at another set, you find\r\ninnumerable mischiefs arising from the concession; and there is hardly\r\nany means of measuring which set of arguments preponderates. The motive\r\nof granting Patents is _primâ facie_ very simple and unobjectionable.\r\nYou wish to encourage inventions, by which the wealth of the world is\r\nso much increased, and you therefore promise inventors a temporary\r\nmonopoly of their use, on the single condition that the inventions shall\r\nbe made public. But for some such guarantee, it is said, many inventors\r\nwould have no temptation to rack their brains, and capitalists would be\r\nafraid to help them in putting their ideas into a complete shape. That\r\ninvention, as a matter of fact, is to some extent encouraged, is certain,\r\nthough Lord Stanley hardly touched upon the point. On the other hand,\r\nhardly any Patent-Law can do what it professes, while it is certain to\r\ndo much harm; and this is, at least, the character of our own law. The\r\nrewards with which it tempts inventors are too often delusive, and they\r\nat least would have small real cause to complain of its abolition. No\r\nPatent brings its holder any immediate pecuniary right. He can only sue\r\npeople who infringe his Patent, and the costliness of Patent suits is\r\nsuch that he is seldom able to protect himself. To make the property\r\nworth anything, a capitalist must take it up; but the capitalist, in\r\ndoing so, stipulates for the lion’s share of the profit. Probably in\r\nninety-nine cases out of a hundred the reward was obtained by such\r\nspeculators, and not by inventors. This, of itself, we believe, would\r\nnot be a sufficient argument against conceding Patent-rights; but it\r\nwould certainly be sufficient, if inventors could be induced in some\r\nless costly way to surrender their ideas to the public. Another reason\r\nagainst Patents, stated by Lord Stanley—that the reward is usually but\r\nof all proportion to the service rendered—is also a strong one, if\r\na better plan can be thought of; but the main reason, the injury to\r\nthird parties, is most serious. There is a great mass of well-founded\r\ncomplaints as to Patents being traps for manufacturers. Improvements\r\nand amendments in the details of machinery and manufacturing processes,\r\nwhich would inevitably be come at by the manufacturers themselves, are\r\nappropriated beforehand by inventors who do not possess in reality any\r\nparticular merit. Manufacturers, are afraid to make slight alterations,\r\nfor fear an inventor comes down upon them; but they never know but what\r\nthey may have to encounter an action for “something they have always\r\ndone.” Even inventors themselves suffer in this way. It commonly happened\r\nthat half-a-dozen men competing in the same line of business would come\r\nalmost simultaneously upon the same discovery; but if A was a week or a\r\nfortnight before B, the latter was excluded from his own discovery. The\r\nPatent-Law, then, not only does little real good to patentees themselves,\r\nbut a great deal of mischief to other people. Who is to decide whether\r\nthe balance of advantage to the public, through encouraging invention by\r\noffering a rather delusive reward, exceeds the disadvantage of impeding\r\nmanufacture and preventing people from using what they themselves\r\ndiscover?\r\n\r\nLord Stanley, though only recommending the matter for the “particular\r\nhandling” of the Government, inclines, on the whole, to the view that\r\nthe Patent-Laws do more harm than good; and we are quite disposed to\r\nagree with him. The decisive consideration appears to be the unavoidable\r\nabuse of Patents for inconsiderable inventions, or inventions of\r\nsimultaneous discovery. The hardship of excluding B from a discovery of\r\nhis own because A had patented it a week before, is such as to demand\r\nthe clearest proof of the expediency of the general law which deprives\r\nhim of the fruit of his labours. Where B is a manufacturer, led up to\r\nthe discovery by the necessities of competition and suddenly laid under\r\ncontribution by a stranger or a rival, the hardship is especially severe.\r\nWe are not sure but that to make any Patent-Law tolerably just, special\r\nprovision should be made for proof of simultaneous discovery, and either\r\ncompensation to all the discoverers by the patentees, or full liberty to\r\nthem to make use of their discovery. It is of equal importance, however,\r\nthat the amendment of manufacturing processes in detail should not be\r\nchecked; and perhaps the fact that the great majority of Patents now only\r\napply to what may be termed details is a main reason for abolishing them.\r\nIt is a simple monstrosity, to quote the case given by Mr. Scott Russell,\r\nthat every conceivable shape of a boiler should be patented, so that the\r\nmost obvious change of form, which some particular exigency obviously\r\nsuggests when it arises, should not be permissible to a manufacturer\r\nunless he pays black mail to somebody else. If it is said that details\r\nare often important, the answer is that manufacturers and inventors have\r\na sufficient stimulus with regard to them without a Patent-Law. The\r\npressure of competition and the large scale of manufacturing, which\r\nmake details important, are sufficient inducements to those interested\r\nto find out something new, or encourage others to find out something\r\nfor them. Just because invention must usually come in the way of great\r\nmanufacturers, who can recoup themselves without Patents, Patents are no\r\nlonger necessary. Men like Sir William Armstrong and Mr. Scott Russell,\r\nwho are themselves considerable inventors, do not care for Patents,\r\nexcept to guard themselves against the interference of others who might\r\ntake advantage of the present law to reap where they have not sowed. They\r\nare quite content to let others alone, if they are let alone themselves,\r\nderiving their profit from general excellence of manufacture, of which\r\nany single process which might be the subject of a Patent is only one\r\nout of many details, and perhaps not the most important. Nor do such\r\ninventors conceal their detailed improvements, so that they are in no way\r\ntempted to do anything for the advantage of the public by the present\r\nlaw. It was observable in the debate that the defence of the present law\r\nrested exclusively with representatives of probably the least important\r\ninventors. Mr. Mundella’s assurance that working men are attached to\r\nthe present law, and that inventors of the working class would either\r\nnot be tempted to invent, or would be deprived of the reward of their\r\nindustry, was, in truth, the only argument in its favour. But it was\r\nplainly insufficient. It would be necessary also to show that such\r\ninventions are overwhelmingly valuable, so as to compensate for all the\r\ninjury a Patent-Law must do; but this was not, and we believe could not\r\nbe, attempted. The special case of poor inventors might be met by an\r\norganised system of voting rewards to those whose inventions had been\r\nlargely adopted and used; but we should not frame an entire law, which\r\nthe public do not require, and which would work a deal of harm, in order\r\nto suit their peculiar circumstances.\r\n\r\nSuch being the nature of the discussion, it is, of course, not worth\r\nwhile saying much on the particular defects of the present law. But\r\nthere is hardly a single point where some alteration is not called for.\r\nIn particular, the Courts for trying Patent cases could be very much\r\nimproved; and additional obstacles might be interposed to frivolous\r\nor entrapping Patents. One of the main reasons for total abolition,\r\nnevertheless, must always be the impossibility of suggesting an amendment\r\nfor some defect which is not itself open to equivalent objections.\r\nNothing, for instance, seems so obvious at first sight than that the\r\npresent law might be amended by compelling patentees to grant licences.\r\nYet the Royal Commission which reported in 1865 was decidedly opposed\r\nto this suggestion, after hearing all that could be said for it. There\r\nis no means of saying beforehand what should be the maximum charge for\r\nlicences, while the moment this principle is introduced the special use\r\nof a Patent as a stimulus to inventors is tampered with—the prospect of a\r\ncomplete monopoly of which they are to make as much as they can. Similar\r\nobjections apply to any suggestion for cancelling Patents which are not\r\nused in a year or two to some material extent. The best inventions,\r\nrequiring the greatest changes in manufacturing machinery, are often\r\nthe slowest to come into operation. For the same reason, it would also\r\nbe impracticable to compel patentees to grant licences at fixed maximum\r\nrates after their Patent had been two or three years old. It might be\r\njust as impossible then, as at first, to say what the licence fee should\r\nbe. If we are to have a Patent-Law, then we can have no substantial\r\nimprovement upon the present one; and it is so bad that it can hardly\r\nlast. Perhaps there is at present a deficiency of evidence on the\r\nsubject—the workmen not having been heard before the last Commission, and\r\nthe information presented as to the Patent-Laws of other countries and\r\ntheir working being very deficient; but though this may be a good reason\r\nfor having another inquiry, we anticipate that it will only confirm the\r\nverdict of impartial judges against the present system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Extract from the “Saturday Review,” June 5, 1869._\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the interesting debate on Mr. Macfie’s motion proved, what scarcely\r\nneeded proving, that our existing Patent-Law is extremely unsatisfactory\r\nin its working, it equally proved that the arguments against having any\r\nPatent-Law at all are not less unsatisfactory. If it were practicable to\r\ndiscriminate between true and sham discoverers, and to ascertain with\r\naccuracy to whom the merit of every new invention really belonged, and\r\nif it were at the same time easy to secure to the man who increased the\r\ncommon stock of useful knowledge the fruit of his own brain, no one would\r\ndream of questioning the moral claim of an inventor to this peculiar kind\r\nof property, any more than we now question the justice of giving to an\r\nauthor a copyright in his own work. But when it is found, or supposed,\r\nto be extremely difficult to do justice to one man without causing\r\nmuch inconvenience and some occasional injustice to a thousand others,\r\nthere is a strong temptation to sacrifice individual rights to public\r\nexpediency. The advocates of a total repeal of the Patent-Laws generally\r\ninsist (as Sir Roundell Palmer did in his ingenious speech), not only\r\nthat they do a great deal of indirect mischief, but that the discoverer\r\nof the most invaluable invention has no claim to any reward except the\r\nconsciousness of having enabled a number of other men to make colossal\r\nfortunes. That such arguments should be used at all proves little more\r\nthan an uneasy consciousness that the proposed repeal would work a\r\ncertain amount of real injustice. Men who are strongly impressed with the\r\nexpediency of ignoring the claims of inventors struggle to escape the\r\nreproach of injustice by stoutly denying the rights which they desire to\r\ndisregard. We would rather see the subject discussed with more courage\r\nand frankness. There are undoubtedly instances in which private claims\r\nmust yield to public expediency, and any persons who think the case of\r\ninventors to be one to which this rule is applicable would do better to\r\nsay so openly than to try to persuade themselves and others that those\r\nwho have created the means of making wealth have no claim to share in the\r\nfruits of their discovery. Sir Roundell Palmer affected to dispose of the\r\nwhole difficulty by saying that there were essential differences between\r\nCopyright and invention; but a principle is not the less sound because\r\nyou may illustrate it by a case which is not on all-fours with that to\r\nwhich you apply it. And the distinctions between Copyright and invention\r\nare by no means so radical as is sometimes assumed. The Copyright-Laws\r\ngive an author a special monopoly because it is conceived that the\r\nproduction of a new work entitles him to a return proportioned to its\r\nmerit, as tested by the demand for it in the market. The Patent-Laws give\r\nan analogous monopoly to an inventor on precisely the same moral grounds.\r\nTo say, as Sir Roundell did, that a book was a new creation, whereas an\r\ninvention was merely the application of the facts and the laws of nature,\r\nwhich are common property, was to speak like a lawyer rather than like\r\na philosopher or a man of science. Whatever other distinctions may be\r\ninsisted on between Copyright and invention, this, at any rate, will\r\nnot bear a moment’s examination. It may have a colour of plausibility\r\nin the case of a poem, a play, or a novel, though even there it is not\r\naltogether sound. But literature includes history, science, philosophy,\r\nmathematics, and the like; and every book on these and most other\r\nsubjects, so far as it has any value, is based entirely upon facts and\r\nlaws which are no more the creation of the author than are the facts and\r\nlaws on which an invention may be founded. In each case there is creation\r\nin the same qualified sense. Say that a man creates what he reveals, or\r\nwhat he proves, and the author and the inventor are equally entitled to\r\nbe called creators. Say, on the other hand, with perhaps more accuracy,\r\nthat to proclaim a previously unnoticed truth is only to announce what\r\nhas all along existed in nature and nature’s laws, and some more modest\r\ntitle than creator must be assumed by author and inventor alike. The\r\ndifference between the two cases is not a difference of principle, but of\r\nconvenience. The thing created, either in the book or the machine, is the\r\nthought or the method; but property in a thought or a method is not what\r\nthe law allows in either case, simply because it would be impossible to\r\ngive an effect to such an enactment. What the law does is to lay hold of\r\nthe most profitable mode of using the idea, and say that for a limited\r\ntime no one but the originator shall be at liberty, in the one case, to\r\nprint the book or a colourable imitation of it; or, in the other, to\r\nmanufacture or use the machine or any colourable imitation of that. It\r\nis impossible, we think, to deny the abstract right of a real author or\r\ninventor, and more palpably impossible to deny it in the one case while\r\nyou admit it in the other.\r\n\r\nApart from his abstract reasoning, there is much in Sir Roundell Palmer’s\r\nargument to show wide differences in practice between the cases of\r\nauthors and inventors. It is undoubtedly true that in a vast majority\r\nof instances the patentee of an invention is not the person to whom the\r\nlargest share of the merit belongs. The rule, equally in scientific\r\ndiscovery and in practical invention, has almost always been found to be\r\nthat, when a great step in advance is completed, no one man can claim the\r\nentire merit. If one wins the race, there are mostly several competitors\r\nwho get a place. Even Newton had rivals treading on his heels, and his\r\ngreat discoveries would not have been lost, though they would certainly\r\nhave been delayed, if his marvellous intellect had never been directed to\r\nscience. The thought of the world, as represented by a little cluster of\r\ninquiring minds, was fast ripening for the harvest which Newton was the\r\nfirst to reap. But no one on this account seeks to deprive Newton of his\r\nglory. And we do not see why the pioneers of practical invention should\r\nbe deprived of the reward for which they work merely because what they\r\nhave done is but to forestall what would have been accomplished, sooner\r\nor later, without them. The real vice of the Patent-Laws is that they\r\ngive a full fourteen years’ monopoly to the first inventor who proclaims\r\nhimself, even though it may be clear that he has not a week’s start of\r\na host of competitors. In order to make sure of adequately rewarding a\r\nvery few real benefactors of mankind, you give an inordinate privilege\r\nto a great many who have done nothing at all in proportion to what they\r\nreceive; and not only do you prohibit every one from borrowing the\r\npatentee’s ideas, but you actually forbid a second inventor, who has\r\narrived at the same result without ever having heard of the first, to\r\nmake any use for fourteen years of the conclusions which he has worked\r\nout by his own unassisted thought and labour. This, of course, is a gross\r\ninjustice, and the opponents of the Patent-Laws say that no machinery\r\ncan be devised by which it can be escaped. Another serious objection to\r\nthe system, as worked in this country, is the indiscriminate grant of\r\na Patent to any one who claims it, leaving it to future litigation to\r\ndetermine whether the Patent is good or bad. The Law Officers of the\r\nCrown receive an enormous amount of fees for Patent business, and it is\r\ntheir function to determine in the first instance whether a _primâ facie_\r\ntitle to the privilege is made out. It might be supposed that, if the\r\nidentical invention has been patented or publicly used before, or if,\r\non the face of it, it is no invention at all, the application would be\r\nrefused. Nothing of the sort happens. No examination of the records at\r\nthe Patent-office takes place to ascertain the existence or non-existence\r\nof earlier Patents for the alleged discovery; and even when there is an\r\nopposition, and it is clearly proved (as in the case of the bullet which\r\nMr. Metford devised and Mr. Whitworth afterwards patented) that there is\r\nnothing new in the invention, the Patent is allowed to go, in order that\r\nthe claimant may have the privilege of a jury to try an imaginary right.\r\nThis is the way in which the crop of litigation is raised which is so\r\noften pointed to as a reproach to the law. The present Attorney-General,\r\nit seems, has introduced the innovation of rejecting the claims of\r\npatentees where the alleged inventions are palpably frivolous, but\r\nsomething much more decided than this is needed to make the preliminary\r\ninvestigation of any real value. The vast number of worthless and\r\ncatching Patents taken out merely as traps for manufacturers is perhaps\r\nthe greatest nuisance incidental to the system, but it is by no means the\r\nmost difficult to suppress.\r\n\r\nAll these evils must be cured, or sensibly abated, if the Patent-Laws\r\nare to survive; and if this is to be done at all, it can only be by\r\nan effective preliminary inquiry. That there are difficulties to be\r\nencountered in such a scheme cannot be denied, but it is not yet shown to\r\nbe so complete an impossibility as Sir Roundell Palmer assumed it to be.\r\nWith the best machinery a few Patents would slip through which, on closer\r\ninvestigation, would be held to be bad; but even the clumsiest methods\r\nof _bonâ fide_ inquiry would have sufficed to weed out some ninety per\r\ncent. at least of the existing Patents. A mere search by proper officials\r\nat the Patent-office, with the aid of the excellent indexes which they\r\npossess, would settle the fate of the great majority of applications,\r\nand the opposition of rival inventors or manufacturers would expose\r\na great many more if it were not understood, as it is now, that any\r\nopposition before the Law Officers is a mere waste of time. Under the\r\nexisting system we have a tribunal which is not, as a rule, competent\r\nfor the work, and which makes no real effort to do it. The Law Officers\r\ngive up the investigation in despair; but it by no means follows that\r\na scientific tribunal, with all the aids which the Patent-office could\r\nsupply, might not be found extremely useful. The experiment, at any rate,\r\nhas not been tried; and it is scarcely fair to inventors to deprive them\r\nof all protection merely because a perfunctory inquiry by an unscientific\r\nand busy lawyer may have failed to exclude from the list of patentees a\r\nformidable body of mere impostors.\r\n\r\nWe take it to be quite clear that the attempt to do justice ought not to\r\nbe given up until the impossibility of putting the law on a satisfactory\r\nfooting is clearly made out. Mr. Mundella is probably as ingenious as\r\nmost manufacturers, but he says that all the inventions in which he\r\nis interested came out of the brains of his workmen, and that they\r\nare sharing with him and the public the benefit of their discoveries.\r\nApart from the serious inconveniences caused by the law as it is now\r\nadministered, no one could desire to confiscate the ingenuity of\r\nartisans for the benefit of master manufacturers. As matters stand now,\r\na poor patentee is generally helpless to turn his invention into money\r\nwithout the assistance of a capitalist; but to allow a master, because\r\nhe is rich enough to use an invention, to pick the brains of a clever\r\nartisan without making him any acknowledgment, would be to aggravate the\r\nplutocratic tendencies of the age, which most serious thinkers would\r\ngladly mitigate as far as possible. The product of invention and thought\r\nis a very difficult kind of property to protect, but it is not on that\r\naccount the less deserving of protection, if any means can be devised for\r\ngranting it without too grave an interference with the commercial freedom\r\nwhich public expediency demands. The subject requires a more searching\r\ninvestigation than it has yet received. Lord Stanley’s Commission\r\nscarcely touched the root of the matter, and no attempt has even been\r\nmade to test the feasibility of such suggestions as the report contained.\r\nIt is for those who attack the law to make out a conclusive case, not\r\nmerely against the particular system in force, but against every possible\r\nscheme for securing to inventors the benefit of their own work. And this\r\nhas certainly not yet been done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACTS FROM RECENT CLASS PERIODICALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlong with some true light and sound sense, the shifts to which advocates\r\nof Patent restrictions are put when they venture upon argument, and the\r\nboldness with which advances are being made on the path of monopoly in\r\nthe face of attack, may be deduced from the following extracts picked up\r\nat a glance in current periodical class literature:—\r\n\r\n\r\nA GOOD ILLUSTRATION AND BAD ARGUMENT.\r\n\r\nHowever absurd it may appear, a valid Patent has been for fourteen years\r\ngranted, which gave a monopoly to one person to make all the pins for\r\nall our railways. I should have thought that the use of wooden trenails\r\nto fasten materials together, to have been of ancient date, but for this\r\nPatent. That existing Patent-rights are, to some extent, obstructive\r\nto the “right of way,” is just as true as that the right to enclose\r\ncommon land is so. The natural remedy, in both instances, is to reserve\r\n“a right of way” to the public, not necessarily a free right, but one\r\nopen to all, on payment of a reasonable toll in the latter, and of a\r\nreasonable royalty in the former case. With more show of justice, might\r\nthe enclosure of common lands be prohibited than Patent-rights for\r\ninventions be refused, for the common lands were not only discovered, but\r\nin human use before enclosure, which is more than can be said of any true\r\ninvention.—_Extract from “English Mechanic,” July 2, 1869._\r\n\r\n\r\nGROWTH OF STRANGE VIEWS AMONG SURGEONS.\r\n\r\nA change in the views of English medical men is perceptible on the\r\nquestion of the propriety of a surgeon taking out a Patent for an\r\ninstrument he has invented. Although we have always felt it the duty of\r\na physician who subscribed to a fixed code of ethics to abide by its\r\nregulations, and therefore have always opposed, on technical grounds,\r\nthe taking Letters Patent on improvements in surgical appliances, we\r\nfreely grant that there is no _à priori_ immorality in the act.... If\r\nwe read Dr. Chapman’s letter to the _British Medical Journal_, we find\r\nthat he there says: “I have been informed that soon after Dr. Richardson\r\ninvented his ether-spray instrument, Her Majesty’s physician, Dr.\r\nJenner, said, if he were Dr. Richardson, he would patent the instrument.”\r\nAnd further on we read, “Before I patented the spine bags, I consulted\r\nthe President of the College of Physicians, Sir Thomas Watson, and the\r\nhead of the Privy Council, Mr. Simon; and both these gentlemen expressed\r\nthe opinion that I was justified in doing so.” Such quotations, in\r\nour humble opinion, show that Dr. Chapman is, in all probability,\r\nright, and the majority of the profession wrong, in objecting to his\r\npatenting an instrument which is by no means mysterious or secret. We\r\nshall not be sorry to see this frank admission gain ground with the\r\nprofession in this country, and the prohibition of patenting instruments\r\nreconsidered.—_Medical and Surgical Reporter._\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION REQUIRES.\r\n\r\n... To diminish the period for which he shall be allowed to retain his\r\nexclusive right.... If a gratuitous privilege of five years’ duration be\r\na sufficient price for John Bull to pay inventors for inducing them to\r\nmake their inventions Patent, I know no just reason why he should pay\r\nmore in the form of monopoly price for that which he can purchase for\r\nthe shorter term.... To enable an efficient preliminary investigation\r\nto be made with facility, either by individuals, or by the official\r\nexaminers, I propose to compile a history of inventions, discoveries, and\r\nprocesses, for one rather more full and modern than Beckman’s would be\r\nrequired. I have long advocated the compilation and official publication\r\nof this great work, for it is not nearly enough for this purpose to have\r\nonly a classified abridgment of the specifications of English or British\r\nPatents. In addition to this, besides all foreign Patents, a brief\r\nclassified description of the million things formerly and now being done\r\nand suggested is almost absolutely necessary to enable either official or\r\nprivate investigators to arrive at anything like a probable resolution of\r\nthe question, if a given thing it is proposed to Patent is new.—_Extract\r\nfrom “English Mechanic,” July 9, 1869._\r\n\r\n\r\nHARD PUSHED FOR A DEFENCE OF PATENTS.\r\n\r\n(Extract from Leading Article in “_Engineer_” of July 9, 1869.)\r\n\r\nIn a civilised state, we say, everything is property that is the fruit\r\nof a man’s own intellect, and if the law does not make it property, then\r\nthe law, not the principle, is to blame. Advocates for the abolition\r\nof Patent-Laws consider the following as one of their most powerful\r\narguments: They say that if inventors would restrict themselves to the\r\ninitiation of inventions great and good, there might be some plea for\r\nthe concession of reward through monopoly or otherwise; but the fact is\r\notherwise. It suffices to take the most cursory glance at Patent records,\r\nthey say, to be made aware that processes great and good constitute but a\r\nvery small minority of those on behalf of which Patent fees are paid and\r\nthe rights of monopoly claimed.\r\n\r\nWe readily grant the second clause of the statement. The number of great\r\nand good inventions, by comparison with the obviously trivial claims, is\r\nvery small indeed; but we altogether fail to perceive what legitimate\r\nsource of grievance this can be to the public. On the contrary, it\r\nseems to us demonstrable that under a competent system of Patent-Law\r\norganisation the fees accruing from these claims of trivial intrinsic\r\nimport might be utilised and made to fructify. The surplus thus accruing\r\nmight be used in diminution of existing Patent fees, in establishing\r\na museum of inventions creditable to the nation and the epoch, and in\r\nother ways conducive to the development of invention in general.... Our\r\nown experience points to many cases like this; wherefore we are assured\r\na proposition of some not wholly averse to Patents, whereby they would\r\nestablish courts of preliminary investigation to determine whether any\r\ngiven process should be deemed worthy of patenting or not, would be\r\naltogether futile.\r\n\r\nAccording to our way of viewing the case, the registration of inventive\r\nnovelties should be encouraged on other grounds than that already\r\nspecified. We hold the record of failures to be of, at least, equal\r\nimportance to the record of successes. Anybody who has given much time\r\nto promote invention will, we are sure, coincide in our opinion, that\r\nthe knowledge of what others have been unable to accomplish in some\r\nparticular line of invention is one of the most likely conditions of\r\nhis own success. This collateral value of failures does not seem to\r\nhave been heeded by those who are most prominent amongst the advocates\r\nof Patent abolition. From matters of undisputed non-success, we pass\r\nnow to the consideration of others confessedly of some value, but the\r\nimportance of which is trivial. In respect to such it is argued by Mr.\r\nMacfie that they much embarrass the manufacturer by needlessly stopping\r\nthe way until terms can be come to with the inventor. The plausibility\r\nof this reasoning we fail to see. Does not the assumed worthlessness\r\nof an invention of the series contemplated bar the need of coming to\r\nterms with the inventor at all? What manufacturer in his senses would\r\ntreat for the use of an invention that he knows to be worthless—such\r\nforeknowledge being a postulate on which the argument is raised, and on\r\nwhich the objection turns? The national value of a readily-accessible and\r\nclassified record of invention must be obvious to all. Those who would\r\ndesire to uphold the Patent-Laws, and those who would wish to abolish\r\nthem, must alike coincide in this point. We insist upon this part of the\r\nsubject all the more strenuously from the conviction that the upholding\r\nthe abrogation or modification of the Patent-Laws will turn, after all,\r\non considerations of public expediency, not on considerations of right\r\nand wrong to individual inventors. This being so, the collateral value of\r\nPatent-Laws, in establishing a record of inventive progress, cannot be\r\ntoo prominently kept in view.\r\n\r\n\r\nPATENT RIGHTS AND PATENT WRONGS.\r\n\r\nSir,—On page 279, in speaking of steel rails, you say: “Could a better\r\nresult than that achieved by Mr. Bessemer, and by those who hold licences\r\nunder him, have been arrived at under the ‘No-Patent’ system?” Decidedly\r\nnot, for it has landed them in wealth; but I will suppose a by no means\r\nimprobable case. Suppose Belgian manufacturers had secured Patent-rights\r\nin England, and demanded a royalty preventing English manufacturers from\r\nselling their steel rails, as you state, under 12_l._ per ton, when\r\nwithout such royalty they could be sold at 9_l._ per ton. Now, the case\r\nwould stand thus: the Belgian manufacturers could be supplying the world\r\nwith steel rails at 9_l._ per ton, while the English manufacturers were\r\nprevented _by their own laws for fourteen years_ from manufacturing them\r\nunder 12_l._ per ton, although all the materials were lying at their\r\ndoors, and both masters and men wanting the work. If England wishes to\r\nmaintain her position in the trading and manufacturing world, monopolies\r\nand prejudice must be things of the past....\r\n\r\nYou will say the inventor has a right to the invention. Granted; there\r\nwere no laws to prevent him from finding it out, and getting all the\r\nadvantage he could out of it, and there ought not then to have been a law\r\nmade to prevent any one else finding out the process or improving upon\r\nit. I cannot see the right of giving anyone the power to block the public\r\nhighway of thought and enterprise. Necessity is the mother of all useful\r\ninventions, and if steel rails were required, English manufacturers would\r\nhave soon found out how to make them, without a Patent Law to help them.\r\n\r\n                                                                  R. R. S.\r\n\r\n—From the _English Mechanic_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPORT OF THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF COLOGNE ON THE PATENT QUESTION.\r\n\r\nFor the following translation I am indebted to the Hon. J. C. Heustler,\r\nof the Legislative Council of Queensland:—\r\n\r\n\r\nThe resolution to abolish Patents on inventions, arrived at by the\r\nChamber of Commerce of Cologne, at their sitting of the 15th Sept., 1863,\r\nhas been confirmed in a report to the Ministry of Commerce, as follows:—\r\n\r\nThe Patent is a monopoly, and if it has been said in its favour that it\r\nis justifiable and only temporary, it is, notwithstanding, subject to all\r\nthe disadvantages in its consequences which are common to all monopolies.\r\n\r\nEndeavours to compete in the sphere of inventions are suddenly checked by\r\nPatents, while, on the other hand, many a patentee, instead of continuing\r\nto work with zeal, and to advance in the direction commenced, simply\r\noccupies himself to watch with jealousy possible infringements of others\r\non his monopoly during the currency of his Patent.\r\n\r\nConsumers pay exorbitant prices during a number of years for the\r\nmanufacture so patented, or receive the same in a less perfect condition\r\nthan would be the case if competition had exercised its wholesome\r\ninfluence on the manufacture of the article in question. It may be\r\nrejoined, that nobody is forced to buy the patented article, or to make\r\nuse of the patented invention; also that the common weal would profit\r\nmore by the utilisation of an invention, even if burthened for a period\r\nof from five to fifteen years, than not have it in use at all.\r\n\r\nTo this it could be replied, with good reason, that with the constant\r\nactivity which working minds develop upon all fields of industry, the\r\ninvention of it would have been made shortly after by B, and by him\r\npossibly would have been brought to light in still greater perfection. If\r\nthe invention of A, however, is patented, the inventive perfectioning of\r\nthe object by B must rest until the expiration of A’s Patent.\r\n\r\nThe more an invention is to the purpose for general adaptability, the\r\nmore reasonable appears the supposition that others would have arrived at\r\nthe same invention.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the contrary intention, Patents proved themselves an\r\nimpediment to the progress of human ingenuity, and by each newly-granted\r\nPatent an unrelenting “halt” is shouted to the competition in that\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nOn closer reflection, even persons who move in circles which, from\r\npersonal interest, have hitherto used their influence to give the\r\ngreatest possible stability to Patent-rights, will come to the conviction\r\nthat the disadvantages outweigh by far the advantages.\r\n\r\nThe Patent system, viewed from a standpoint of political economy,\r\nproduces a similar influence as the Lottery. The “grand prize” dazzles\r\nall; however, only one can have it, and the multitude of those who\r\ncontributed to the solving of the problem lose very often a not\r\ninconsiderable stake in uselessly-incurred costs, and lost time and\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\nMany have been induced by the system to rush after doubtful reward in\r\nthe shape of a Patent, instead of steadily applying their ability and\r\nknowledge to regular industry.\r\n\r\nBesides, it is not sufficient to make up one’s mind to make an invention\r\ncapable of being patented; such proceedings lead to a success in the\r\nmost rare cases. The most important discoveries have proceeded, on the\r\ncontrary, from those who thoughtfully prosecute their regular avocations.\r\nThe fear that with abolition of Patents the ingenuity of mankind would\r\nslacken, we cannot share, because the germ of progress is embodied\r\nin human nature, and because the joy over an invention made, and the\r\nsatisfaction felt at a new discovery, in themselves are powerful impulses\r\nfor the employment of energies in such directions. A strong proof of the\r\ncorrectness of this assertion the men of science furnish, whom we have to\r\nthank for the most important discoveries, in so far as the application\r\nof physical and chemical laws to industry are concerned—which have been\r\nalways handed over immediately to the public with the utmost liberality.\r\nOthers have based their inventions on such laws, and managed to acquire\r\nfor this one or that other a Patent, and thus, to their own advantage\r\nand to the cost of the public, made an invasion of territory hardly\r\nlegitimately theirs. They reaped where others had sowed.\r\n\r\nLet us take, for instance, all the lighting apparatuses during the last\r\ntwenty-five years. The different lamp contrivances during this period\r\nfor which Patents have been granted by the industrial States of Europe\r\nwill number several hundreds. Now, if we sift the matter, we will find\r\nthat all these patented combinations are simply variations of a principle\r\nwhich Berzelius established and applied to his spirit-lamp.\r\n\r\nSimilar is the experience with the invention of Bunsen, who reduced the\r\ncosts of the electric battery considerably, by applying a hard sort of\r\ncoke in place of the platinum in Grove’s Battery.\r\n\r\nIn a still higher degree has Morse acted meritoriously. It is true,\r\nMorse, in consideration of the signal importance of his invention,\r\nhas received a public reward in the shape of money, and this mode of\r\nacknowledging real merit in the province of inventions recommends itself\r\nfor adoption even in individual States.\r\n\r\nAfter the abolition of Patents, apart from such acknowledgments as\r\naforesaid, very soon associations of the various interested parties who,\r\nby each discovery, would be equally benefited, will be formed for the\r\npurpose of rewarding new inventions made in accordance with indicated\r\nproblems, the solution of which may be felt to be most important to them.\r\n\r\nFor State rewards only such inventions should be taken cognizance of as,\r\naccording to their nature, cannot be kept secret, and are not of a kind\r\nthat will ensure to the inventor an adequate reward by his own use of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nPrinciples, which hitherto have not been admissible for Patents, would be\r\nlikewise excluded from rewards. There could be also no premiums for new\r\nmodes of manufacture, such as simpler or cheaper manufacture of materials\r\nalready known, and in the same manner manufacture of new articles\r\ndirectly going into consumption, because, in the first case, the secret\r\nuse of the invention would present an equivalent, while in the latter\r\ncases the start which the inventor has with regard to manufacturing, as\r\nwell as disposal, before and over his competitors, in most cases is more\r\nthan sufficient reward for the merit of having given mankind new means\r\nof satisfying human enjoyments and necessities. It was consequently a\r\ntimely Convention between the States of the Zollverein, which already,\r\nunder date of 21st September, 1842, acknowledged the principle that the\r\ngranting of a Patent henceforth could establish no right to prohibit\r\neither the import or the sale, nor the use of articles agreeing with\r\nthose patented, as far as articles of consumption are concerned, and\r\nthat a right of that nature was only applicable to machinery and tools\r\nfor manufacturers and artisans.[10] Accordingly, the granting of rewards\r\nwould have to be restricted to inventors of useful machinery and\r\ntools, who do not use them solely in their own interest and keep their\r\nconstruction a secret, but, on the contrary, make them accessible to\r\neverybody by multiplication.\r\n\r\nWith such regulations as to Patent-right in force in Germany, it will be\r\nobserved that here, as in other countries, the great disadvantage arises\r\nfrom this, that by the patenting of an invention its utilisation or trial\r\nis prohibited to home industry, while the foreigner is quite at liberty\r\nto make use of it and to bring the articles in question to market in the\r\ncountry where the Patent exists.\r\n\r\nIn this manner foreign industry is actually enjoying a preference, to the\r\ndetriment of the industry of that country in which the Patent is granted;\r\nconsequently even the patentee, through such foreign competition, loses\r\nthe intended reward partially. The example furnished by the Patent on\r\nthe manufacture of aniline colours in France illustrates the case.\r\nOn the whole, it is not to be denied that those advantages which the\r\nPatent monopoly should guarantee are often not in harmony either with\r\nthe value or the importance of the patented invention; just as often\r\nthese advantages do not reach the author of the invention at all, but\r\nflow into the pockets of such people as make it a business either to\r\npurchase Patent-rights, and so work them for their own account, or in\r\npartnership with the patentee, taking care to secure for themselves the\r\nlion’s share. It is further proved by experience that insignificant and\r\nmost simple inventions have often brought extraordinary advantages to\r\nthe patentee, while the discoverers of important novelties (we instance\r\nonly Reissel, who introduced the screw as a motor in navigation), in\r\nspite of Patent-rights, could not find gratitude nor reward for what they\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\nWe arrive, consequently, at the conclusion, that the partly imaginary\r\nadvantages of Patents are outweighed by the disadvantages attached, and\r\nthat, as the industrial condition of Switzerland exemplifies, no further\r\nuse of such means is any longer required in helping to elevate industry\r\nin all its branches to a very high standard, or to keep pace with the\r\ndevelopment of other countries in that direction.\r\n\r\n[10] I cannot but think the patenting of machinery a great disadvantage\r\nto any community. Yet if importing were allowed in spite of the Patent,\r\nthe exaction of heavy royalties, and of royalties graduated according\r\nto work performed (which is the greatest source of evil), would be\r\nimpossible, and the disadvantage be neutralised.—R. A. M.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACTS FROM M. VERMEIRE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter most of this _fasciculus_ is in type, I am favoured with a copy of\r\nM. Vermeire’s “Le Libre Travail,” Brussels, 1864, from which I subjoin\r\nthree extracts.\r\n\r\nThe first, a noble passage quoted by that gentleman from M. Bastiat’s\r\n“Harmonies Economiques:”—\r\n\r\n    “C’est la concurrence qui fait tomber dans le domains commun\r\n    toutes les conquêtes dont le génie de chaque siècle accroît le\r\n    trésor des générations qui le suivent. Tant qu’elle n’est pas\r\n    intervenue, tant que celui qui a utilisé un agent naturel est\r\n    maître de son secret, son agent naturel est gratuit sans doute,\r\n    mais il n’est pas encore commun; la conquête est réalisée, mais\r\n    elle l’est au profit d’un seul homme ou d’une seule classe.\r\n    Elle n’est pas encore un bienfait pour l’humanité entière.\r\n    Si les choses devaient rester ainsi avec toute invention, un\r\n    principe d’inégalité indéfinie s’introduirait dans le monde;\r\n    mais il n’en est pas ainsi, Dieu, qui a prodigué a toutes ses\r\n    créatures la chaleur, la lumière, la gravitation, l’air, l’eau,\r\n    la terre, les merveilles de la vie végétale, l’électricité et\r\n    tant d’autres bienfaits innombrables, Dieu, qui a mis dans\r\n    l’individualité _l’intérêt personnel_ qui, comme un aimant,\r\n    attire toujours tout à lui, Dieu, dis-je, a placé aussi au sein\r\n    de l’ordre social un autre ressort anquel il a confié le soin\r\n    de conserver à ses bienfaits leur destination primitive, la\r\n    gratuité, la communauté. Ce ressort, c’est la concurrence.\r\n\r\n    “Ainsi l’intérêt personnel est cette indomptable force\r\n    individualiste qui nous fait chercher le progrès qui nous le\r\n    fait découvrir, qui nous y pousse l’aiguillon dans le flanc,\r\n    mais qui nous porte aussi a le monopoliser. La concurrence\r\n    est cette force humanitaire non moins indomptable qui\r\n    arrache le progrès, à mesure qu’il le réalise, des mains de\r\n    l’individualité, pour en faire l’héritage commun de la grande\r\n    famille humaine. Ces deux forces qu’on peut critiquer, quand on\r\n    les considère isolément, constituent dans leur ensemble, par le\r\n    jeu de leurs combinaisons, l’harmonie sociale.\r\n\r\n    “Et, pour le dire en passant, il n’est pas surprenant que\r\n    l’individualité, représentée par l’intérêt de l’homme en\r\n    tant que producteur, s’insurge depuis le commencement du\r\n    monde contre la concurrence, qu’elle la réprouve, qu’elle\r\n    cherche à la détruire, appelant à son aide la force, la ruse,\r\n    le privilége, le sophisme, la restriction, la protection\r\n    gouvernementale, le monopole.”\r\n\r\nThe second, portion of an interesting letter by M. Paillottet,\r\néditeur-commentateur of Bastiat’s works, (written in May, 1863):—\r\n\r\n    “Cette connaissance, résultat de son travail, est pour toujours\r\n    à lui; nul ne peut la lui enlever ni ne doit l’empêcher de s’en\r\n    servir.\r\n\r\n    “Seulement, comme la nature permet à d’autres hommes de se\r\n    livrer à la même recherche, qu’elle les y excite et souvent\r\n    même leur en fait une nécessité, le jour doit arriver où la\r\n    notion que cet homme possédait seul est aussi possédée par\r\n    d’autres. Ce jour-là, je dis que le premier inventeur n’a plus\r\n    seul le droit de se servir d’une notion qu’il n’est plus seul\r\n    à posséder. Prétendez-vous que je le dépouille du résultat de\r\n    son travail? J’ai à vous répondre: Si je dépouille le premier,\r\n    vous, vous dépouillez le second, le troisième, le centième\r\n    inventeur peut-être; si je dépouille le Chinois, vous, vous\r\n    dépouillez Guttemberg!\r\n\r\n    “Un mot maintenant sur le droit à la réciprocité de services.\r\n\r\n    “Je crois fermement, avec Bastiat, que ‘la véritable et\r\n    équitable loi des hommes, c’est: Echange _librement débattu_ de\r\n    service contre service.’\r\n\r\n    “Si un inventeur me rend service, je lui dois un service\r\n    équivalent; Dieu me garde d’en disconvenir. Mas de même que je\r\n    n’exige pas de l’inventeur ses services et ne l’oblige pas à\r\n    en recevoir de moi, j’entends qu’il n’exige pas les miens et\r\n    ne m’impose pas les siens. Entre lui et moi, l’échange doit\r\n    être précédé d’un libre débat amenant le consentement des\r\n    deux parties. M.

Vermeire himself,\r\nto whose work I refer readers. He will allow me to say I impute it to\r\nno deficiency in courtesy on his part that it escaped earlier and due\r\nnotice. He there gives the Chambers of Commerce of this kingdom credit\r\nfor opinions which they have not generally embraced up to this hour:—\r\n\r\n    “M. Eugène Flachat attaque la loi des brevets comme une _lépre\r\n    industrielle_. M. Arthur Legrand ne critique pas moins vivement\r\n    cette législation surannée ainsi que M.

It is even shared in by many eminent\r\npolitical economists. I think, however, I may venture to assert that in\r\nthis country the Government, far from participating in this feeling,\r\nwould rather be inclined, in the event of a revision of the Patent-Laws,\r\nto secure in a more effectual way the rights of inventors.\r\n\r\n\r\nGERMANY.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER OF AN EMINENT HOUSE IN COLOGNE.\r\n\r\nAlthough we think it rather difficult to form a general opinion on this\r\nmatter, we still believe that most Industrials would welcome abolition\r\nof Patents for Inventions. The Cologne Chamber of Commerce expressed,\r\nin September, 1863, its opinion in the same sense. German legislation\r\nregarding Patents will probably be reformed. A proposition made in this\r\ndirection by Count Bismarck to the Bundesrath, contained in the “Annalen\r\ndes Norddeutschen Bundes,” by Dr. George Hirth, 1ster Heft Jahrgang,\r\n1869, page 34, 42, II., would interest you much, as it coincides, we\r\nbelieve, with your motion. The latest publications in German literature\r\non the subject are Klostermann “Die Patents Gesetzgebung aller Lander,”\r\nBerlin, 1869; Barthel “Die Patent-frage,” Leipzig, 1869.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACT FROM “DIE PATENTS GESETZGEBUNG ALLER LANDER,” BY DR. R.\r\nKLOSTERMANN (BERLIN, 1869).\r\n\r\nA short time since, in the course of the present decade, the public has\r\nspoken out, following numerous and important persons who wished the\r\nentire abolition of Patents for inventions, because they allege that the\r\nexistence of such is incompatible with the free-trade movements. They\r\nsaid that such impede industry instead of advancing it; that the claim of\r\nthe first inventor to a monopoly is untenable; that discovery is not the\r\nwork of one man, but the ripe fruit of industrial development.\r\n\r\nFrom the difficulty and complexity of the subject, men would do away with\r\nPatent-Laws; but the real cause of the agitation against them lies in the\r\nenormous development which our international commerce has undergone in\r\nthe last ten years through free-trade, steam-boats, and railways.\r\n\r\nAs the complete abolition of the “customs-limits,” with the German\r\nZollverein [customs-union], was not made without a direct transformation\r\nof the Patent-Laws and a positive limitation of Patent protection, so\r\nis—through the concluding of the treaties of commerce made during the\r\nlast ten years between the Zollverein and France, Great Britain, Belgium,\r\nand Italy—a _total reform_ in the Patent-Law rendered necessary.\r\n\r\nAll countries, with _the single exception of Switzerland_, recognise by\r\ntheir existing laws the necessity of _Patent protection_; and this case\r\nof Switzerland is particularly brought forward by those opposed to the\r\nPatent movement. The Commission which was appointed of Swiss experts (and\r\nwhich said that Patent protection is unnecessary and tends to nothing\r\ngood) was impartial enough to avow that the particular advantages which\r\nSwitzerland draws from existing circumstances arise from the fact that\r\nin all the adjoining countries the protection of Patents does exist,\r\nbut in Switzerland alone not so. Swiss industry, which is exceedingly\r\nsmall, is placed in the position of imitating all foreign Patents which\r\nfind a market in Switzerland, and getting the benefit of the discoveries\r\nmade under the protection of foreign Patents. Switzerland is just in the\r\nposition of a man who keeps no cats because he can use his neighbours’.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOLLAND.\r\n\r\nI have before me a series of valuable illustrative documents printed by\r\nthe Government of the Netherlands, which are too long to introduce here.\r\nThe movement for abolishing Patents in that country, already referred to\r\non pages 196-230, was consummated by a striking majority, in the First\r\nChamber, of no less than 29 to 1; the abolition to take effect from 1st\r\nJanuary next, existing rights, of course, to be respected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON PERPETUITY OF PATENT-RIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following observations, abridged from a review, by M. Aug. Boudron,\r\nof M. le Hardy de Beaulieu’s _La Propriété et sa Rente_, are from the\r\n_Journal des Economistes_ for May:—\r\n\r\nThe author assimilates the inventor’s privileges to proprietorship of a\r\nfield. Nevertheless there is a fundamental difference between the two\r\nkinds of property. Independently of State privileges, the originator of a\r\ndiscovery may use it as his own, and even to the exclusion of all others,\r\nprovided he keep it secret, so that he shall have no competitor to\r\nencounter; whereas the owner of a field, if he is deprived of his right,\r\nloses all. The advantages of an invention may be enjoyed simultaneously\r\nby many persons; the produce of a field by one only. Now for a difference\r\nof importance affecting the interests of the public. Give the possessor\r\nof a field his right in perpetuity, and you have circumstances the most\r\nfavourable for its yielding all the produce which it can. Not so with\r\nthe privilege of an inventor, for it essentially consists in hindering\r\nothers from bringing the methods or materials that are patented into\r\nuse. From the time of invention and first _exploitation_ the privilege\r\nis an obstacle; it limits the amount of good that society would in its\r\nabsence enjoy. What, then, is the motive of certain States in conceding\r\nthis exclusive privilege?... The legislators who have created the right\r\nthought that there would in consequence be a larger number of useful\r\ninventions and improvements, and that, on the whole, society would be a\r\ngreater gainer than if there were no Patents.... As there are innumerable\r\ninstruments and processes for which Patents have been and might still be\r\ntaken, there must, if perpetuity of privilege be granted, be a prodigious\r\nnumber of monopolies, and almost no operation could be performed, nothing\r\ndone, without people being obliged to pay tribute to some privileged\r\nperson. There would be a countless host of administrators like receivers\r\nof tolls and pontages, diminishing wealth in place of creating it; the\r\nworld would soon produce too little to sustain the monopolists and their\r\n_employés_. We thus arrive at an impossibility. But conceive all this\r\npossible, and the world must yet miss a great number of inventions and\r\nimprovements, that would under the system of perpetuity be prevented.\r\nThis is seen by the obstacles which even privileges of limited duration\r\nthrow in the way of new inventions. In actual practice progress is often\r\nattained only by the use of previous inventions. But what if these are\r\nthe subject of Patents the holder of which will not come to terms or\r\ncannot be treated with? Retardation, if the privilege is temporary; a\r\nfull stop, if perpetual.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES ILLUSTRATIVE OF MR. MACFIE’S SPEECH.\r\n\r\n[Page 17.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe views taken in the text as to the meaning of the word “manufacture”\r\nreceive confirmation from the following extract from the _Engineer_ of\r\nJune 4, 1869:—\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AMERICAN PATENT-LAW.\r\n\r\n\r\n... Accordingly, in the first general Patent-Law passed by Congress,\r\nthe subject for which Patents were to be granted were described as\r\nthe invention or discovery of “any useful art, manufacture, engine,\r\nmachine, or device, or any improvement therein not before known or\r\nused.” In the next statute—that of 21st February, 1793—the phraseology\r\nwas first introduced which has been ever since employed—namely, “any\r\nnew and useful art, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or\r\nany new and useful improvement in any art, machine, manufacture, or\r\ncomposition of matter, not known or used before the application for a\r\nPatent.”... We have, then, the following four heads of subjects suitable\r\nfor Patents—viz., an art, a machine, a manufacture, and a composition of\r\nmatter.... In England, to make a new process the subject of a Patent,\r\nthe word “manufacture” would be used, and would have to be interpreted\r\nsomewhat liberally. Thus, in some cases, there might not be a perfect\r\ndistinction between the thing itself and the art or process of making the\r\nthing.... With regard to the head “manufacture,” we cannot do better than\r\ngive the definition which Mr. Curtis has added as a note to his work.\r\nHe says a manufacture “would be any new combination of old materials,\r\nconstituting a new result or production in the form of a vendible\r\narticle, not being machinery.”...\r\n\r\nAs well as from the following extract from—\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHINDMARCH ON “VENDING OR SELLING.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“The sole privilege of making the invention as expressed ... is\r\nin truth the same in substance as the sole privilege of using and\r\nexercising it.... By the first section of the Statute of Monopolies,\r\npatents granting ‘the sole buying, selling, making, working, or using\r\nof anything’ are declared to be void, and the proviso in favour of\r\ninventions contained in the sixth section only extends to ‘grants\r\nof privilege of the sole working or making of any manner of new\r\nmanufactures,’ leaving the sole buying or selling of anything within\r\nthe prohibition.... The sole privilege granted by a _Patent_ for an\r\ninvention authorises the inventor ‘to make, use, exercise, and vend’ the\r\ninvention.... And as no one can use the invention except the patentee,\r\nno one besides him can lawfully have such articles for sale.... Every\r\npart of the privilege granted by a _Patent_ for an invention, when thus\r\nexplained (!) is therefore clearly within the meaning of the exception\r\ncontained in the _Statute_....”\r\n\r\nI demur. Is there anything in the _Statute_ to prevent a person\r\n_importing_ articles and _vending_ them though the same as the privileged\r\nperson is alone allowed to _make_ or _work_? In point of fact that surely\r\nmight, when the statute was passed, be done from Scotland and Ireland as\r\nto manufactures not patented in these countries, but patented in England.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Page 18.]\r\n\r\nThe number of Patents granted in the first fifty years after the Statute\r\nof Monopolies was seventy-two, or at the rate of less than one and a-half\r\nper annum.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Page 19.]\r\n\r\nThe following list of applications for Patents up to the end of 1862, in\r\nseveral classes, is abridged from Mr. Edwards’ interesting treatise on,\r\nor rather against, “Letters Patent for Inventions:”—\r\n\r\n                                        Oct., 1852, to   Before\r\n                                        Dec. 31, 1862.

PERCY’S WORKS ON METALLURGY.\r\n\r\n[Page 34.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COPPER TRADE.\r\n\r\nIt would be sheer waste of time even to notice many of the mis-called\r\nimprovements in copper—something for which Patents have been granted in\r\nthis country during the last twenty years. Some of the patentees display\r\nsuch deplorable ignorance of the first principles of chemistry, and such\r\nutter want of practical knowledge, as would seem hardly possible with the\r\npresent facilities of acquiring information.\r\n\r\nVarious Patents have been granted for alleged improvements in the\r\ntreating of copper ores, of certain products obtained in the smelting\r\nof copper ores, &c., which are only worthy of notice as affording, as\r\nI conceive, satisfactory illustrations of the defective state of our\r\nexisting Patent-Laws.... That a man who has worked out an original and\r\nvaluable process from his own brain, and who may have incurred great\r\nexpenses in bringing it to a practical issue—it may be, after years of\r\nprotracted toil and anxiety—should have secured to him by law during\r\na moderate term the exclusive privilege of reaping the substantial\r\nreward of his own invention, appears to me as just and reasonable as\r\nthat an author should be protected against piratical and unprincipled\r\npublishers. But that the law should confer upon a man the exclusive right\r\nof appropriating to his own benefit facts which are perfectly familiar to\r\nevery tyro in chemistry, and of practising operations which are of daily\r\noccurrence in the laboratories of chemists, is as impolitic as it is\r\nunjust. And surely, the particular “inventions” above referred to belong\r\nto this category. I cordially subscribe to the opinion expressed by Mr.\r\nGrove, Q.C.—namely, that the real object of Patent-Law was to reward\r\nnot trivial inventions, which stop the way to greater improvements, but\r\nsubstantial boons to the public; not changes such as any experimentalist\r\nmakes a score a day in his laboratory, but substantial, practical\r\ndiscoveries, developed into an available form.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HOT BLAST.\r\n\r\nIt cannot strictly be termed a great invention, for what great exercise\r\nof the inventive faculty could it possibly have required for its\r\ndevelopment? There was no elaborate working out of a process or machine,\r\nas has been the case in many inventions, but the thing was done at once.\r\nWithout wishing in the smallest degree to detract from the merit to which\r\nMr. Neilson is justly entitled, I may nevertheless express my opinion\r\nthat the hot-blast was a lucky hit rather than an invention, properly\r\nso-called. Whatever opinion may be entertained as to the expediency of\r\nPatents, there can be no doubt that such a Patent as this ought never\r\nto have been granted. A Patent, even though it may be proved invalid,\r\nconfers upon its possessor a _locus standi_ in the eye of the law,\r\nand enables him thereby to involve innocent persons in most expensive\r\nlitigation, to say nothing of the attendant annoyance and anxiety. The\r\npreliminary examination before the Attorney or Solicitor-General is in\r\nmany cases an absolute farce, and nothing less. The present system,\r\nalthough confessedly an improvement on the old one, is yet in many cases\r\nhighly obstructive and injurious to national interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Page 50.]\r\n\r\nThe following passage from the _Engineer_ of May 28, proves clearly that\r\nthe Bessemer Patents do raise prices of iron:—\r\n\r\nThe present royalty on rails is 2_l._ per ton; on each ton a drawback of\r\n1_l._ is nominally allowed, but the nature of Mr. Bessemer’s arrangements\r\nwith regard to scrap, crop ends, waste, &c., is such that the true\r\nroyalty on every ton of Bessemer rails delivered to a railway company—in\r\nother words, sold—amounts to about 1_l._ 5s. 6d. After the lapse of Mr.\r\nBessemer’s Patents in February, 1870, this sum, all but 2s. 6d. per ton\r\nroyalty on plant, will be saved; and, therefore, in March next year,\r\nrails may be bought for at least 1_l._ 3s. per ton less than they cost\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWORKING MEN AS INVENTORS.\r\n\r\n[Page 62.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSomewhat to my surprise, I am led to apprehend that the interest\r\nof working men will be represented as coinciding with retention of\r\ninvention monopoly. I hope they are too wide awake to believe such a\r\nfallacy, and too upright to approve of the continuance of a proved\r\nnational disadvantage, even though it were not a fallacy. If Patents are\r\ninjurious to the community by raising prices of articles of consumption\r\nand utility, then the operative and labouring classes, inasmuch as they\r\nconstitute the bulk of the population, must be the chief sufferers.\r\nIf Patents interfere with labour in any direction, and tend to drive\r\ntrade away from our island, they, as the mainstays of industry, must be\r\nthe chief sufferers. The only pretence for such an allegation as I am\r\ncombating is this: some inventions in all trades, many inventions in\r\nsome trades, are made by artisans, who therefore will lose this form\r\nof reward. True enough; but is the reward to these few individuals a\r\ncompensation for the evils inflicted on the many—the millions? and is not\r\nthe reward often so like the gift of a white elephant, or the catching of\r\na Tartar—so much of a delusion, a difficulty, a disadvantage, a snare, a\r\nruin—that their wisest counsellors would warn against its fascination,\r\nespecially if through their own favour for my propositions there is the\r\nchoice of fair and satisfactory alternative recompenses? The position\r\nof working men in respect to Patents is frequently dealt with in this\r\ncompilation; their attention and co-operation I respectfully invite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INVENTORS’ INSTITUTE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Inventors’ Institute has been formed for the purpose of maintaining\r\nthe Patent System, and amending it in such a way as, I fear and am sure,\r\nwill only make its yoke more galling and its burden heavier. The public\r\nwill do well to remember that, in spite of the name, this is rather a\r\nsociety of patentees, including in its membership a portion only of those\r\ninventors who take Patents, and not including the innumerable inventors\r\nwho do not take Patents, and who suffer by the system which the Institute\r\nis intended to perpetuate, extend, and knit more tightly on us all and\r\nin the first place on them. The honoured names who direct that society\r\nwill do well to consider who are inventors and what are inventions. If\r\nthey would but reflect that we are almost to a man inventors in the sense\r\nin which the great mass of patentees are such, and that the majority\r\nof inventions which choke the Patent-office are such as themselves, at\r\nany rate, would disdain to claim and scorn to annoy their fellows by\r\npatenting, they would probably arrive at the conviction—which is half-way\r\non the road to complete emancipation of trade from the fetters they\r\nhug—that the system is so practically bad that rectification is hopeless,\r\nand would join in endeavours, not to amend what is, even theoretically,\r\ndefective and bad, but to devise and introduce a thoroughly good\r\nsubstitute. I hope the present publication will not be in vain, when it\r\nendeavours to remove well-meaning prepossessions by force of truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTIFICATION OF STATE REWARDS.\r\n\r\n[Page 81.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is just and expedient that the public exchequer should pay inventors,\r\nbecause—1. The State is entitled, or required, to undertake all\r\nbeneficent and useful works which, while they ought to be done for or\r\nby the nation, yet cannot be so well, or at all, done by individuals.\r\n2. Though individuals, more than the nation collectively, will reap the\r\nbenefit of these payments, it is manifest that the range of inventive\r\nimprovement is so wide that on the average of years every portion of the\r\ncommunity, and every individual in all portions, will share the benefit\r\npretty equally. 3. The demand for remunerating inventors proceeds from\r\nthe State, not manufacturers or producers. 4. These last cannot, under\r\nthe _régime_ of free trade, pass over from their own shoulders upon\r\nthose of consumers—who are the real, because ultimate, recipients of the\r\nbenefit—the burden of royalties, or other payments to inventors. 5. The\r\ncharge of £200,000 per annum is, after all, on a population of thirty-two\r\nmillions but a poll-tax of _three halfpence per head_. On how easy terms\r\nwould we obtain for the nation a universal, prompt enjoyment of every\r\nnovelty, and complete emancipation of our commerce and manufactures from\r\nan incubus and thraldom which are every day becoming more depressing!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PATENT-OFFICE ESTABLISHMENT.\r\n\r\n[Page 86.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Patent-office in Southampton-buildings, Chancery-lane, is an\r\nestablishment highly creditable to its organisers, but far too little\r\nknown. Its free consulting library should be more frequented. The\r\npublications there sold at a cheap rate, and presented gratuitously to\r\npublic institutions which undertake to keep them for reference under\r\nfitting regulations, are invaluable. The indexes, manuscript and printed,\r\nthere kept, are elaborate, and include lists of scientific and practical\r\nmatter affecting commerce and the arts, culled from periodicals issued\r\nin all countries. No change in our manner of dealing with inventions can\r\ndeprive us of, or supersede the use of, such an accessible storehouse\r\nof useful knowledge. The wonder is, that its advantages are not more\r\nextensively availed of, and that so few even of our great towns have\r\napplied for sets of its specifications and indexes. There is, in spite of\r\nthe establishment’s excellence, room for improvement in several respects,\r\none of which is in the providing better means for connecting itself with\r\nthe mass of the people in the provinces.\r\n\r\n“THE NEW CANADIAN PATENT-LAW.—The Patent Bill which has been for some\r\ntime before the Parliament of the Dominion, has passed. The hope, to\r\nwhich we alluded a few weeks ago, that the Bill might be modified to\r\nenable Americans to obtain Patents in Canada, has not been fulfilled;\r\nand the only effect of the Bill, so far as we are interested, is to\r\nshut out American inventors from a larger amount of territory than\r\nbefore.”—_Extract from “American Artisan,” June 20, 1869._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES AND EXTRACTS ON ROYALTY IN COPYRIGHT, WITH ESPECIAL REFERENCE TO\r\nINTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATIONS AFFECTING NORTH AMERICA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL COPYRIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe present opportunity is availed of to recommend to notice the royalty\r\nform of International Copyright as one which might probably be acceptable\r\nto the people of the United States. I apprehend there is little or no\r\nprospect of their agreeing to negotiate on the basis of the monopoly\r\nform of Copyright which is now established in both countries. This has\r\noften, but never successfully, been urged on the United States. The\r\nadvantages to British authors and publishers of so large an extension of\r\narea are obvious. There are now in that country near forty millions of\r\npeople much more able to read and to buy than our thirty millions. It\r\nis in the interests of British authors, publishers, and traders, most\r\ndesirable to get so large an addition to the number of the readers and\r\nbuyers of English literature. Every year the benefit will be greater,\r\nbut perhaps less easily attainable. The conscience and generous impulses\r\nof the great American nation will naturally incline them to negotiate on\r\na principle which (as I hope they will consider that of royalties does)\r\nat once fairly meets the reasonable claims of authors and the equally\r\nreasonable claims, or rights, of the public. Authors and the trade would\r\nsoon become familiar with, and reconciled to, the change in the form\r\nof their remuneration. They cannot but admit and feel that it is the\r\nduty of statesmen, when constituting Copyright, to take care that its\r\neffect is on the whole beneficial—as beneficial as is consistent with\r\nfair treatment of authors—to the whole body of the people for whose\r\nsake they govern. If I am warranted in anticipating that, whereas now\r\nunder monopoly a new book of intrinsic value is seldom or almost never\r\npossessed by, or even seen in the houses of, the labouring population,\r\nthere would under royalties be a tendency to cheapness which might be\r\nconfidently relied on as the means of bringing such works within reach of\r\nthe masses—not when they are stale, but when they are fresh—can I doubt\r\nthat the concurrence both of authors and legislators is a matter of hope\r\napproaching to certainty? When staleness is suggested as a deterrent\r\nfrom, and freshness as a pleasant stimulus to, the reading of books, this\r\nis no more than the practical recognition of a taste universal among\r\nmen and women, whether it concerns food material or food intellectual.\r\nLet us work it for the good of our race. But it is a quality and power\r\nunattainable except either by royalties or else by the Chinese system of\r\nopen literature. That the present system works unsatisfactorily, even\r\nin a mere trade point of view, I am convinced, and for confirmation\r\nrefer to figures I append from a Return on the Book Trade lately laid\r\nbefore the House of Commons. The sale of books at home and the export\r\nof books to the colonies and foreign parts, admit of vast expansion.\r\nWe should legislate so as to accomplish, in regard to books, at the\r\nleast such an expansion as has been attained in regard to newspapers.\r\nWhile the present form of Copyright remains in force, it would be vain\r\nto expect that the existing hindrances will be overcome. Publishers,\r\ntherefore, may well co-operate. But I appeal with equal directness to\r\nphilanthropists, especially all those who have the power of representing\r\nto their fellows what a folly and mistake it is to write books with a\r\nview to the moral, social, and religious welfare of men, and yet to rest\r\nsatisfied with a system of law and trade that find the recompenses of\r\nauthorship and of publishing ventures in a limited sale of dear books\r\ninstead of an extensive sale of cheap ones—of a few good books at a large\r\nprofit instead of many good books at a small! I could adduce from my\r\nown transactions conclusive proofs of the bad working and obstructive\r\noperation of monopoly in Copyright. Ireland, in particular, may well\r\nexclaim against it; for before the Union the publishers of Dublin used\r\nto drive a useful business in reprinting British works which they have,\r\nunder the present system, been deprived of, to their own loss and the\r\nincalculable disadvantage of their countrymen.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese, it is said, do not recognise Copyright. What the effect is\r\non their literature I know not. But their post-office and custom-house\r\nofficers should, at any rate, rejoice that, unlike the establishments in\r\nenlightened Britain, they are not employed in the interests of private\r\nindividuals as detectives of contraband literature.\r\n\r\nI submit with some confidence a scheme I have sketched. It is one which\r\nI hope will at least prepare the way for this important national and\r\ninternational question receiving the earnest attention it merits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGGESTIONS FOR THE AMENDMENT OF THE SYSTEM OF COPYRIGHT FOR BOOKS, BY\r\nMR. MACFIE.\r\n\r\n(From the _Leith Herald_ of — Jan.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    1. The period of exclusive privileges to continue as at\r\n    present, unless any publisher demand that it shall be\r\n    shortened, which he may do any time after the end of the first\r\n    year, provided he intimates to the author or assignee of the\r\n    author, or their agent, at the Stationers’ Hall, or other place\r\n    duly appointed, that he intends to publish an edition at a\r\n    lower price within a year, and also lodges there a specimen\r\n    copy and a statement of the intended price.\r\n\r\n    2. On such new edition the intended publisher shall be liable\r\n    to pay in advance [five] per cent. on the retail price of the\r\n    book.\r\n\r\n    3. And there shall be impressed on the first sheet of each copy\r\n    a distinctive stamp approved by the Stationers’ Hall, without\r\n    which it shall be a penal offence to print or vend any copy.\r\n\r\n    4. Every publisher making such an intimation shall be bound to\r\n    actually publish, according to his notice, unless the author or\r\n    his assignee, within six months of his receiving intimation,\r\n    shall lodge at the Stationers’ Hall a bond obliging himself\r\n    to publish on his own account, an edition at least as good in\r\n    quality, at a price no higher; such bond to bar any action\r\n    under the provisions of Article 1.\r\n\r\n    5. No reprint to differ from the original edition, without\r\n    the author’s consent, either in the way of abbreviation,\r\n    enlargement, or alteration of the text.\r\n\r\n    6. If a book is out of print for a whole year, the copyright\r\n    privilege to lapse.\r\n\r\n    7. By special arrangements a longer period of exclusive\r\n    privilege shall be allowed for Encyclopædias, works _de luxe_,\r\n    &c. [Engravings, photographic illustrations, &c., not to be\r\n    subject to the condition now proposed in this paper.]\r\n\r\n    8. Government to endeavour to negotiate international copyright\r\n    treaties on the principle exhibited in the foregoing, with\r\n    the United States and other foreign countries, in order to,\r\n    first—the increase of the area of remuneration to authors;\r\n    and, second, the removal of all unnecessary obstruction to the\r\n    exchange of literary productions.\r\n\r\n    9. On the completion of the above treaty or treaties, all\r\n    examination and stopping of books by the Custom-house and\r\n    Post-office to cease.\r\n\r\n    10. Government to endeavour to persuade foreign Governments to\r\n    exempt printed matter from duty, or else to charge duty at a\r\n    moderate rate by weight, and not _ad valorem_.\r\n\r\n    The British colonies to enter into the Copyright “Verein” which\r\n    would be so constituted, but without any import or export duty,\r\n    except in so far as proximity to the United States may render\r\n    modification in Canada desirable.\r\n\r\n    In the event of such international arrangements being\r\n    negotiated, the author or assignee of any copyright work to\r\n    have an agent in the capital of each of the united countries,\r\n    who shall be empowered to receive and give the notices,\r\n    intimations, and bonds provided for in Articles 1 and 4.\r\n\r\nI am satisfied that the system of royalties could be carried out in\r\npractice without difficulty. Each author would have a special stamp—call\r\nit, if you will, trademark—the use of which, required as a condition of\r\ncirculation, he would authorise under such superintendence as he may\r\nthink fit. No copy should be legally saleable without the stamp, just as\r\nin France no pamphlet can be sold without the Government stamp.\r\n\r\nStrong confirmation of the applicability of the royalty principle to\r\nliterature reaches me after the preceding is in type, which I subjoin;\r\nNo. I. being extracts from articles published in 1837 and 1839, by Thomas\r\nWatts, Esq., Keeper of the Printed Books of the British Museum; and No.\r\nII., a chapter from “Traité des Droits d’Auteurs,” by M. Renouard, Paris,\r\n1838.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n(Extract from the _Mechanics’ Magazine_, Vol. 27, 1837.)\r\n\r\nThis is the last of the new provisions mentioned in the preface, and\r\nthe only one in the whole bill that seems intended for the benefit of\r\nthe public. We were in hopes of finding at least one other, to provide\r\nfor some method of “taxing” the price of new works, as used formerly\r\nto be done in foreign countries when a Copyright was granted. A limit\r\nis proposed to be fixed to the profits of railway companies; why are\r\nauthors and publishers to be allowed to demand what sums they please?\r\nWhen they find they have a giant’s strength, they are too apt to use it\r\nlike a giant. There is such a thing, not only in theory, but in practice,\r\nas laying too heavy a tax on an author’s admirers. In the height of\r\nWalter Scott’s popularity there was no other way of obtaining an early\r\ncopy of a new poem than by purchasing it in the inconvenient form of a\r\nponderous quarto; it generally, a few months afterwards, appeared in an\r\noctavo shape; but in one instance, Sir Walter, finding it desirable to\r\nforce the sale of an unsaleable periodical with which he was connected,\r\n“The Edinburgh Annual Register,” inserted one of his poems in one of the\r\nyearly volumes, and drove all such of his adversaries as had not bought\r\nthe quarto to buy a cartload of old news, along with the vision of Don\r\nRoderick. Is all this justified by the comprehensive maxim that a man may\r\ndo what he likes with his own? Since the Copyright of Sir Walter’s poems\r\nhas drawn near the term of extinction, his publishers have thought fit to\r\nissue them in editions not only so cheap that they suit the pocket, but\r\nso small that they may be put into it. His novels are Copyright still,\r\nand the consequence is, that they are still not only dear, but ill got\r\nup. What a torrent of Elzevir editions of “Waverley” there would be if it\r\nwere now public property! At present there is not one edition of it in\r\none volume, the most usual and convenient form for a standard novel—not\r\none edition in Elzevir, the most usual and convenient size. And this is\r\nto remain so for the next sixty years!\r\n\r\nSergeant Talfourd might provide a remedy for these evils in the literary\r\ntribunal which, though he makes no proposal for it in the present Bill,\r\nhe is anxious to see established, for the decision of literary cases (and\r\nhis arguments for which, by the bye, would answer equally well in regard\r\nto every other profession). It would provide itself, if a project were\r\nadopted for a Copyright-Law, of which we shall now proceed to state the\r\noutlines, but without the forlornest hope of ever seeing it tried.\r\n\r\nLet an author be empowered to sell the Copyright of his work to a\r\nparticular publisher for the space of five years only—a term at the end\r\nof which nine-tenths of the works now published are completely forgotten.\r\nLet it then become public property, in the same way that a play, on being\r\npublished, becomes public property, since Mr. Bulwer’s Act. As a manager\r\nnow has the right to act any play he chooses, on paying a certain sum to\r\nthe author for each night of representation, so let any printer have the\r\nright to print any work on paying a certain sum to the author for each\r\ncopy he issues. The main, perhaps the only, objection to the plan would\r\nbe the necessity of establishing some Excise regulations, with regard to\r\nprinting-offices, for the prevention of fraud.\r\n\r\nThe great recommendation, of course, would be, that of every work of\r\nreputation we should have cheap and elegant editions; that such of them\r\nas required comment and illustration (and now, when the Copyrights\r\nexpire, it is speedily found that very few of them do not) would receive\r\nit at an earlier period, and that the works of living authors would be\r\nmuch more extensively diffused than they are, while their interest would,\r\nit is hoped, be advanced in an equal proportion to their fame.\r\n\r\nAfter all, however, we are afraid that no Copyright Act, however\r\nfavourable to authors, will exercise a perceptible beneficial influence\r\non literature. Our own at present is frivolous, and it is assigned as a\r\ncause that our authors are ill-protected. If this be really the cause, in\r\nwhat sort of a state ought that of Germany to be? It is, however, in the\r\nvery country where piracy is most prevalent that solid literature is most\r\nflourishing. Unhappily, no Act of Parliament can reform the taste of the\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Extract from the _Mechanics’ Magazine_, Vol. 29, 1839.)\r\n\r\nHow and why is it that foreign editions take the place of our own?\r\nBecause, undoubtedly, of the difference in the price of the two, caused\r\nby the monopoly which in one case remains in the hands of one publisher.\r\nIs it not notorious, in fact, that even those of the middle classes\r\nwho have a love for literature never, with rare exceptions, purchase a\r\nCopyright book, and that for the very good reason that they cannot afford\r\nit? Their only way of getting a sight of a new publication complete is\r\nby obtaining it from a circulating library; and particular passages that\r\nthey wish to have by them, for the purpose of reference or re-perusal,\r\nthey get possession of, if they get possession at all, by purchasing them\r\nextracted in some of the cheap periodicals which subsist on extracts. The\r\neffect of this state of things is now manifesting itself in the condition\r\nof our literature, which is becoming more and more the literature of\r\ncirculating libraries—a heavy mass of light reading. How, indeed, can it\r\nbe expected that an author will take pains when he knows that all his\r\npains will be of no use; that his history or his travels will only come\r\ninto the hands of those who will be compelled to rush through them at a\r\ncertain rate, and return them by a certain hour. “He who runs may read,”\r\nunder the present system, and none but those who do run.\r\n\r\nThis system has come up under the twenty-eight years’ monopoly. Is it\r\nlikely to be improved under a law which will secure a monopoly for\r\nsixty years certain, and perhaps a hundred? We do not think it is. The\r\nadvocates of the Bill indeed triumphantly refer us to the recent cheap\r\neditions of Copyright authors, as proofs of the—we hardly know what; for\r\nwhat do they prove in their favour? The greater part of the works alluded\r\nto—the poems of Southey, the novels and poems of Walter Scott, are works\r\nof which the Copyright is on the verge of expiring.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following extract is also from the same volume:\r\n\r\nThe strangest misapprehensions seem indeed to prevail generally as to\r\nthis question; one of the strangest is, that the only parties interested\r\nare the authors and the booksellers, and that if the Bill be thrown out,\r\nthe former will suffer, that the latter may be enriched by the fruit of\r\ntheir labours. The third party, whose interests are not the least among\r\nthose concerned—the public—is generally quite lost sight of. Thus it has\r\nbeen said, in reference to the often-quoted case of Wordsworth, that the\r\nquestion is, whether the heirs of the poet shall enjoy the profit of\r\nhis works, or the heirs of Mr. Tegg (the bookseller who is so active in\r\nopposition to the Bill). But it is no such thing. Under the present law,\r\nat Mr. Wordsworth’s death, and the consequent expiration of the Copyright\r\nin his works, they would become the property, not of this or of that\r\nman’s heirs, but of “all England,” of the public at large. If Mr. Tegg,\r\nor his heirs, reap any profit, it will only be by the exercise of their\r\ncallings, and Mr. Wordsworth’s heirs will have just the same privilege.\r\nThe notion that the title of the cause now pending is only “Author _v._\r\nBookseller,” has been worked upon to such an extent, that it would almost\r\nseem that the advocates of the Bill see the importance of mystifying the\r\npublic on the subject, and preventing the names of the real defendants\r\nfrom being seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FROM M. RENOUARD’S “TRAITÉ DES DROITS D’AUTEURS.”\r\n\r\n_La garantie d’un droit exclusif de copie sur la reproduction de\r\nl’ouvrage est le meilleur mode de salaire de la société envers l’auteur._\r\n\r\n\r\nLong-temps on a cru que les écrivains et les artistes devaient être payés\r\npar des pensions et des faveurs. C’étaient en quelque façon l’Etat et\r\nles princes qui acquittaient ainsi la dette du public, et en même temps\r\nque l’on ne se faisait nul scrupule d’accepter ces faveurs, on était\r\nfacilement disposé à rougir du paiement à tirer du public par la vente\r\nde son droit de copie sur ses propres ouvrages (1). Une partie des idées\r\na bien changé. Aucun préjugé défavorable ne s’attache à flétrir la vente\r\nqu’un auteur fait de ses œuvres. Tout au contraire, une réaction s’est\r\nopérée. L’industrie s’est mêlée à la littérature, et a trop souvent pris\r\nsa place. Les pensions et les faveurs n’ont pas cessé; mais elles ont\r\nété reléguées à un rang accessoire et secondaire. Les littérateurs n’ont\r\nplus comme autrefois une existence à part, qu’ils tiennent des princes\r\net des grands, dont la libéralité leur faisait de paisibles loisirs, et\r\nauxquels, en échange, ils donnaient des louanges et quelquefois de la\r\ngloire. Les lettres mènent à la fortune, jettent dans les affaires et les\r\nhonneurs.\r\n\r\nL’observateur moraliste aurait à dire sur cette revolution mêlée de biens\r\net de maux. Dans l’ordre actuel, comme dans la vie littéraire ancienne,\r\nles passions grandes ou mesquines, les instincts généreux ou cupides, le\r\ncalcul et le désintéressement ont leur action et leur rôle. Mais, somme\r\ntoute, les idées sont mieux à leur place. Vivre du tribut volontaire que\r\nle public s’impose ne rabaisse aucune position, ne messied à aucun génie.\r\n\r\nD’insurmontables difficultés s’élèvent contre tout mode de paiement,\r\nqui procéderait par voie de pensions, de traitement fixe, ou même, sauf\r\nquelques exceptions très rares, par prix d’achat, une fois payé, achat\r\nqui prendrait la forme d’expropriation pour cause d’utilité publique,\r\nsi l’auteur n’était pas laissé maître de s’y refuser. Avec de telles\r\nformes de salaire, la justice distributive serait impossible; et il n’est\r\npas de trésor qui pût suffire aux insatiables prétentions, aux faveurs\r\ncapricieuses, aux concussions faciles auxquelles on ouvrirait une large\r\nporte. Qui donc si, par exemple, on adoptait le procédé d’expropriation\r\npour cause d’utilité publique, déclarerait cette utilité et apprécierait\r\nles travaux? qui calmerait les rivalités? qui ferait justice de la\r\nmédiocrité? qui inventerait des récompenses dignes du génie, sans\r\nsoulever l’envie? qui irait au devant du mérite fier ou modeste?\r\nAttribueriez-vous au gouvernement l’estimation des ouvrages à acheter\r\ndans l’intérêt public? et ne voyez-vous pas à quels périlleux soupçons,\r\nà quelles intrigues subalternes, à quelles corruptions habiles, à quels\r\nprofits honteux vous exposez l’administration, sans parler de toutes\r\nles erreurs auxquelles elle ne saurait échapper? Ferez-vous évaluer\r\nles ouvrages des écrivains par leurs pairs; et, si désintéressée, si\r\nmodeste, si impartiale que soit toute la littérature, oserez-vous ne vous\r\nen rapporter qu’à elle seule dans sa propre cause? Trouverez-vous dans\r\ndes magistrats, dans des jurés, les habitudes d’esprit et la spécialité\r\nde lumières indispensables pour une si hasardeuse décision? Pour moi,\r\nje n’aperçois de toutes parts qu’inconvéniens, qu’impossibilité. Il\r\nn’est qu’un seule juste appréciateur du salaire dû aux écrivains et aux\r\nartistes: le public. Il n’est qu’une seule appréciation juste: celle que\r\nle public, sans la formuler, mesure sur l’utilité et le plaisir qu’il\r\ntire d’un ouvrage. Un seul mode de paiement me paraît juste et possible:\r\nc’est celui qui attribue à l’auteur, sur chaque édition ou sur chaque\r\nexemplaire de son ouvrage, un droit de copie.\r\n\r\nCe moyen est celui que l’expérience a fait reconnaître comme le plus\r\nsimple; c’est aussi le plus équitable; car, en général l’évaluation la\r\nplus judicieusement approximative de l’utilité d’un livre consiste dans\r\nle succès qu’il obtient.\r\n\r\nIl résulte de l’adoption de ce moyen que le salaire de l’auteur se trouve\r\ntrès subdivisé, et que le prix de chaque exemplaire s’augmente de la part\r\nqu’il supporte dans la valeur générale assignée à l’objet de la copie.\r\n\r\nSans doute, ce renchérissement est un inconvénient; car les livres à bon\r\nmarché sont des propagateurs d’idées plus rapides, plus puissans, plus\r\nactifs que ceux dont le prix est élevé. Mais il n’y a pas de paiement\r\npour les auteurs, si l’on n’a, par une voie quelconque, recours au public\r\npour le fournir. Renchérir un livre, parce qu’il faut acquitter le droit\r\nde copie, c’est établir une sorte d’impôt. Or, un impôt, quoique offrant\r\ntoujours en lui-même des inconvéniens pour le public, se légitime par\r\nsa destination, lorsqu’il rend, en dépenses générales, en sécurité\r\nindividuelle, en garanties efficaces, plus que ce qu’il ôte à chaque\r\ncontribuable. C’est acheter trop cher l’abaissement du prix d’un livre\r\nque de ne pas payer l’auteur, que de le sacrifier à ses travaux, que de\r\nle décourager et de le jeter dans l’avilissement par la misère. Le livre\r\ncoûtera un peu plus, mais il verra le jour, mais on ne l’aura pas étouffé\r\navant sa naissance; mais surtout on n’aura pas été injuste envers celui à\r\nqui on le doit. Dire que l’on aimerait mieux passer un pont, un canal,\r\nsans rien payer, que d’en rembourser les frais par un péage; que l’on\r\naimerait à être gardé par une armée, sans payer les soldats; jugé par\r\nles tribunaux, sans payer de juges; instruit ou récréé par un auteur,\r\nsans payer son travail; par un libraire, sans payer les frais de vente;\r\npar un imprimeur, sans payer les frais de fabrication; par un laboureur,\r\nsans payer sa culture et son blé, ce serait la prétention étrange\r\nde tout prendre dans la société sans y rien mettre, et d’exploiter\r\nnos semblables, comme s’ils n’étaient pas égaux à nous; ce serait le\r\nrenversement de toute idée sociale.\r\n\r\nCet impôt au profit de l’auteur sur son ouvrage peut se percevoir de deux\r\nmanières. L’une consiste à interdire à tout autre qu’à l’auteur ou à ses\r\nayant-cause, la faculté de fabriquer l’ouvrage et de le vendre; l’autre\r\nserait de laisser à chacun pleine liberté de fabriquer et de vendre\r\nl’ouvrage, mais à la charge de payer une certaine rétribution à l’auteur.\r\nLe premier système établit un privilège, le second une redevance.\r\n\r\nLe second système peut de prime abord séduire. Beaucoup de personnes qui\r\nne renonceraient qu’avec peine à voir dans le droit de copie un objet de\r\npropriété, auraient volontiers recours aux redevances, pour conserver par\r\nune sorte de suzeraineté qui pourrait indéfiniment s’étendre, quelque\r\nimage d’une propriété indéfiniment transmissible. Là se place à l’aise\r\nl’ordre d’idées qui, faisant deux parts de la partie spirituelle et de\r\nla partie lucrative de chaque ouvrage, livre au public la jouissance de\r\nla première, et ne retient parmi les biens vénaux et exploitables que la\r\nseconde.\r\n\r\nNe nous occupons pas encore des objections qu’il y aurait à faire, soit à\r\nla très longue durée, soit à la perpétuité d’une redevance. Ces argumens\r\ns’appliqueraient également à la trop grande extension que l’on essaierait\r\nde donner à, la durée des privilèges. Examinons les inconvéniens inhérens\r\nau mode de redevance considéré en lui-même.\r\n\r\nCe qui le rend inadmissible, c’est l’impossibilité d’une fixation\r\nrégulière, et l’excessive difficulté de la perception.\r\n\r\nPeut-être, à force de soins, surmonterait-on les obstacles à la\r\nperception; mais, quant à la fixation de la redevance, le règlement en\r\nest impossible.\r\n\r\nCette fixation ne peut dépendre ni de la volonté arbitraire de l’auteur,\r\nni de l’évaluation que jugerait à propos de faire toute personne qui\r\nvoudrait user du droit de copie. S’en rapporter à l’appréciation du\r\ndébiteur de la redevance est une absurdité manifeste; mais il serait\r\nabsurde, au même degré, de s’en remettre au prix que demanderait\r\nl’auteur. Que serait ce, en effet, autre chose que de lui conférer le\r\nprivilège d’exploitation? Il vaudrait mieux mille fois lui attribuer\r\nfranchement le monopole sur son ouvrage que d’arriver au même résultat\r\npar cette voie détournée.\r\n\r\nDemandera-t-on à la loi de déterminer une redevance fixe? mais quoi\r\nde plus injuste qu’une mesure fixe, rendue commune à des objets\r\nessentiellement inégaux? Prendrait-on pour base le nombre des\r\nexemplaires, l’étendue du volume, son prix de vente? mais il est des\r\nouvrages dont cent ou cinq cents, ou mille exemplaires suffiront à jamais\r\nà la consommation, tandis que d’autres se débitent par dix et cent mille:\r\nmais l’étendue du volume varie avec tous les caprices de la fabrication:\r\nmais le prix est plus variable encore. Sans parler des hausses et des\r\nbaisses dont personne n’est maître, sans parler de l’extrême facilité\r\ndes fictions dans les prix, et de l’impossibilité de les constater, ne\r\nsait-on pas que l’on fabrique des Télémaque à vingt sous, et d’autres,\r\nqui ne seront pas trop chers, à cent ou deux cents francs? Avec le\r\ntexte qui ne varie point, il faut parler du papier, des caractères\r\nd’impression, des soins typographiques, des ornemens accessoires de\r\ngravure ou autres, objets tous variables à l’infini. Si votre redevance\r\na pour base une valeur proportionelle, chaque Télémaque de deux cents\r\nfrancs produira, pour le seul droit de copie, plus que ne vaudra, dans\r\nl’autre édition, chaque exemplaire tout fabriqué; et cependant ce sera\r\ntoujours le même texte qui n’aura pas plus de valeur intrinsèque dans un\r\ncas que dans l’autre.\r\n\r\nResterait un dernier mode de fixation; il consisterait, en cas de\r\ndésaccord entre le débiteur de la redevance et l’auteur, dans un\r\nrèglement par experts, variable suivant les circonstances. Mais qui ne\r\nvoit tous les frais, tous les délais, tous les procès auxquels chaque\r\naffaire donnerait lieu, pour n’être, la plupart du temps, que très\r\ncapricieusement décidée?\r\n\r\nLe raisonnement juge cette question comme l’expérience l’a tranchée.\r\nL’exclusion de tout autre système acceptable conduit, par la logique, à\r\nl’adoption de privilèges destinés à garantir le monopole d’exploitation,\r\nsoit à l’auteur seulement, soit à l’auteur et à ses ayant-cause. Toutes\r\nles législations actuellement en vigueur en adoptant ces privilèges\r\nont voulu qu’ils fussent temporaires. Les motifs pratiques de cette\r\nopinion ont été indiqués par la haute intelligence de Napoléon dans une\r\ndiscussion du conseil d’état (1).\r\n\r\nPrivilèges, monopoles; ces mots sonnent mal: les mots de propriété\r\nlittéraire recommandent bien mieux une opinion. Si je disais que cette\r\ndifférence dans les mots n’a pas été sans influence sur le succès divers\r\ndes deux systèmes, les lecteurs sérieux trouveraient cette remarque\r\nbien futile; elle est futile en effet; mais elle est vraie, et des\r\npersonnes, tenues pour graves, s’imaginent qu’elles argumentent parce\r\nqu’elles s’écrient: Quoi! vous attaquez la propriété au nom du privilège\r\net du monopole! Je n’aurais point entendu ce propos que j’y aurais cru\r\nd’avance. Que d’opinions se déterminent par des mots!\r\n\r\nJ’ai defini la propriété. Quant à la définition du privilège, tout le\r\nmonde la connaît: c’est une loi privée, _privata lex_. Ai-je besoin\r\nd’ajouter, d’une part, qu’il existe des privilèges parfaitement\r\nlégitimes; et, d’autre part, que souscrire au dogme de la propriété\r\nlittéraire, c’est décider, d’un mot, que le monopole des productions de\r\nl’intelligence sera concentré, à perpétuité, entre un petit nombre de\r\nprivilégiés.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACTS ON INTERNATIONAL COPYRIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nI refer to the following extracts, wishing they accorded more with the\r\nviews I myself espouse. It is about twenty years since Mr. Cobden told me\r\nhe was opposed to Copyright. Whether the philanthropist, statesman, and\r\npatriot changed his opinion, I do not know, but I trust my propositions\r\nare such as many profound admirers of his will find consistent with his\r\npolicy and principles:—\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACT FROM THE COBDEN CLUB PRIZE ESSAY, BY DR. LEAVITT, OF NEW YORK.\r\n1869.\r\n\r\n    When the people of these two nations shall all read freely the\r\n    same books, and when the audience of both English and American\r\n    authors shall be the whole English-speaking public throughout\r\n    the world, the petty jealousies, the trivial misapprehensions,\r\n    the unhappy distrusts, which dishonour the intelligence of the\r\n    age, will be known no more....\r\n\r\n    The proposed International Copyright has an important bearing\r\n    in this connexion. The object of this copyright is to give to\r\n    the authors of books, or their assigns, the exclusive right of\r\n    publication in both countries, in order to keep up the price\r\n    in both. That this enhancement of the price in one country\r\n    of books produced in the other will have a tendency to limit\r\n    the mutual circulation of current literature, will not be\r\n    questioned.\r\n\r\n    Whether the proper encouragement of authors requires this to\r\n    be done, is the point which the two Governments should first\r\n    settle. Copyright does not exist, except as created by law,\r\n    for it begins only when the steps are taken which the law\r\n    prescribes, and it continues only so long as the law extends\r\n    it. There is, therefore, no natural right involved. A man’s\r\n    thoughts are his own only so long as he keeps them to himself.\r\n    When he has uttered them they become the thoughts of all who\r\n    receive them, and who thenceforth use them at pleasure. The\r\n    title to a thought by original invention is no better than\r\n    the title to an asteroid by original discovery. The clothing\r\n    of a man’s thoughts in language no more entitles him to their\r\n    exclusive publication, after they are gone forth to the public,\r\n    than a man’s careful study of the clothing of his person\r\n    entitles him to forbid the imitation of his garb and gait as he\r\n    walks the streets. The law creates Copyright on the assumption\r\n    that the public good will be promoted by the encouragement thus\r\n    granted to authors to publish their works....\r\n\r\n    The pecuniary return realised from their publications is\r\n    neither the only nor the chief encouragement by which authors\r\n    of merit are induced to publish their works. The good they\r\n    may do to mankind, the reputation they may acquire, and the\r\n    satisfaction of seeing their thoughts widely diffused and\r\n    received, and made a part of the mental wealth of their country\r\n    and age, outweigh a thousandfold, to an enlarged and generous\r\n    mind, the value of the material silver and gold yielded by\r\n    their Copyright. And it cannot be doubted that these higher\r\n    returns are directly increased by freedom of publication\r\n    unrestricted by Copyright; because cheapness of price, and\r\n    variety in the forms of publication, are prime elements in the\r\n    widest circulation of books....\r\n\r\n    It is impossible to exaggerate the value of this international\r\n    exchange of ideas through the medium of books, as a means of\r\n    that general assimilation of thought and life which is the\r\n    highest guaranty of political and commercial intercourse and\r\n    permanent friendship between the two countries. While each\r\n    nation, for the most part, buries its own literary trash,\r\n    and each retains the exclusive circulation of books adapted\r\n    specially to its own use, the whole volume of the best thoughts\r\n    of one country have now their widest diffusion, through their\r\n    freedom of publication in the other.\r\n\r\nThe present is a favourable time for the consideration of this important\r\nquestion. The following extract from the editorial columns of the\r\n_Bookseller_, of May 1, is confirmatory and encouraging:—\r\n\r\n    An English author has no rights whatever in the United States;\r\n    this should be thoroughly and clearly understood. He may\r\n    make any arrangement he may think proper with regard to the\r\n    publication of his works, but can acquire no Copyright in\r\n    any way. He may wish Brown and Co. to be his sole and only\r\n    publishers, but cannot prevent Jones and Co. bringing out rival\r\n    editions; consequently, he can derive little or no profit from\r\n    his works. By sending out early sheets, so as to give Brown a\r\n    few days’ advantage over Jones, he may get a small payment, but\r\n    the sum may be very small. Moreover, should Messrs. Jones have\r\n    noted his coming greatness, and have been the first to announce\r\n    his first book, albeit quite unknown to him, they will claim to\r\n    be his publishers; and although, he may wish to give Brown the\r\n    preference, they will feel themselves aggrieved and insist upon\r\n    helping to make him famous. Should he go to America, and first\r\n    publish his book there, he will find himself in a still worse\r\n    position; he is like the notorious “Man without a Country”—he\r\n    has positively no rights at all; he has none in America, and\r\n    has none here. It was long supposed that an American author\r\n    was in a similar position; but it is not so. By a fluke he\r\n    has secured rights which he never dreamed of, and by means of\r\n    _our_ Copyright-Law, may obtain privileges denied him by his\r\n    _own_. His plan is simply this: having prepared two copies\r\n    of his MS., he places one in the hands of his Boston or New\r\n    York publisher, with directions to publish on a certain day;\r\n    the other he forwards to a London house, with directions to\r\n    publish at the same time. Just before the day of publication,\r\n    which is possibly at that time of the year when Saratoga is\r\n    an abode more agreeable than the Fifth Avenue, he proceeds to\r\n    the Canadian side of the Falls. Here he spends a few hours,\r\n    and then returns, without encountering more inconvenience than\r\n    saving his hotel expenses by buying a suit of clothes, on\r\n    which he pays no duty on his return. Thereupon he finds that\r\n    by so simple a process he has obtained Copyright in the United\r\n    States, in the dominion of Canada, in Australia, India, France,\r\n    Germany, and Great Britain! We can imagine the lively twinkle\r\n    of his eye as he crosses the Suspension-bridge, to think what\r\n    cute people the Britishers are to have secured all these\r\n    privileges for him.\r\n\r\n    We believe, therefore, that American authors are not very\r\n    anxious about the matter. By taking a little trouble, they can\r\n    secure all they wish.\r\n\r\n    English authors have not been fairly treated. They are at great\r\n    disadvantage, and must be satisfied for the present to work\r\n    for fame, or but for little more. Fortunately for them, the\r\n    American publishers, seeing that they do what they are legally\r\n    entitled to do, are quarrelling amongst themselves, and are\r\n    crying out for protection.\r\n\r\n    [Here is introduced the case of an American publishing-house\r\n    stated by themselves, which concludes thus:—\r\n\r\n    ... “A review of these facts naturally suggests the reflection\r\n    that the interests of the book-trade in this country, no\r\n    less than the protection of authors in their just rights,\r\n    require further legislation at the hands of Congress. It is\r\n    high time for the passage of a well-considered International\r\n    Copyright-Law, such as will wipe away from our country the\r\n    reproach of what are known as ‘pirated editions.’”]\r\n\r\n    We quite agree with this. Some legislation is called for. But\r\n    now comes a third party, the public, which has its rights as\r\n    well as the others. We shall very likely incur some odium\r\n    for admitting that the million have any rights whatever to\r\n    the productions of men of letters, and may be told that\r\n    emanations of the brain are as much the private property of\r\n    their authors as the guineas are of the man of business. So\r\n    they are, so long as they keep them, to themselves; but when\r\n    they have communicated them to the world they are no longer\r\n    their exclusive property. It is right that they should have\r\n    a modified protection, and we think it must be admitted that\r\n    English authors are amply protected in their own country. We\r\n    think, however, that the American public will not be disposed\r\n    to give them the same amount of protection there, nor is it\r\n    well that they should have it. They are, however, entitled to\r\n    some protection, and we hope the day is not far distant when\r\n    English authors will reap some solid advantages wherever the\r\n    English language is spoken. We are disposed to think that seven\r\n    years would generally be long enough for the purpose; although\r\n    so short a time would be hard upon such men as Grote, Motley,\r\n    Merivale, Webster, and others, whose lives have been spent\r\n    upon their works. We take it for granted that the law, when\r\n    modified, will be the same on both sides, and that Dickens and\r\n    Longfellow will receive equal treatment. We are too selfish to\r\n    give up our cheap editions of Longfellow, and American citizens\r\n    are not what we take them to be, if they would, for a whole\r\n    generation, debar themselves from popular editions of Dickens.\r\n\r\n\r\n(From _The Bookseller_, June 1, 1869.)\r\n\r\n    COPYRIGHT IN CANADA.—Letter by the _Times’_\r\n    correspondent:—“Under the English Law, English Copyrights\r\n    reprinted in the United States are imported into Canada,\r\n    subject to the same duty as other imported articles; but these\r\n    Copyrights cannot be reprinted in Canada, the consequence being\r\n    that the Canadian public is almost entirely dependent on the\r\n    United States for reprints. The English author is seriously\r\n    injured, inasmuch as not one-tenth part of the reprints which\r\n    find their way to Canada are entered at the Custom-house or\r\n    pay duty.”... Mr. Rose replies:—“The undersigned is ready to\r\n    admit that the principle involved is theoretically at variance\r\n    with the general policy of the mother-country, in so far as\r\n    the object of that policy is to secure to authors an absolute\r\n    monopoly in works of literature for a term of years; but it\r\n    must be remembered that the necessity for this exceptional\r\n    legislation arises out of a previous partial departure from\r\n    this theoretical policy, which in its practical operation is\r\n    shown to afford a premium to the industrial interests of a\r\n    foreign country, &c. If it could be shown that the concessions\r\n    asked for would result in any way to the practical disadvantage\r\n    of the author, or lessen the protection which it is intended\r\n    to secure to literary labour, there might be some reason for\r\n    withholding them. If the rate of duty, whether import or\r\n    excise, were inadequate, it would be an equally reasonable\r\n    argument against the extension of the law; and in that case\r\n    the rate could be augmented. But the undersigned fails to see\r\n    any reason why, so long as the importation from abroad is\r\n    permitted, the publication in Canada at an equal rate of duty\r\n    should be withheld.”\r\n\r\n\r\n(Extract from the _Atlantic Monthly_, October, 1867.)\r\n\r\n    ... This work, we repeat, cost the author 24,000 dollars to\r\n    produce. Messrs. Harpers sell it at 15 dollars a copy; the\r\n    usual allowance to the author is 10 per cent. of the retail\r\n    price, and as a rule, it ought not to be more.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Extract from the _American Booksellers’ Guide_, June 1, 1869.)\r\n\r\n    At a public meeting recently held in Montreal, respecting the\r\n    Copyright-Law, it was resolved to apply to Parliament for an\r\n    amendment permitting Canadian publishers to print British\r\n    Copyright works upon the payment of 12½ per cent. to British\r\n    authors.... The payment by the publisher of 5 or 10 per cent.,\r\n    or of a fixed sum, for a Copyright of a book, whether by an\r\n    American or British author, does not necessarily increase the\r\n    price of the book.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Extracts from an Article in the _Athenæum_, July 17, 1869.)\r\n\r\n    This great question is of especial interest at the present\r\n    time, in consequence of opinions and demands put forward by\r\n    Canada with relation to Copyright property in the United\r\n    Kingdom. It appears that for some time past a correspondence\r\n    has been carried on between the Canadian Government and the\r\n    Imperial authorities upon the subject of “Copyright-Law in\r\n    Canada.” This “Correspondence” (having been laid before the\r\n    Canadian Parliament) has been printed and published. It\r\n    commences with a resolution of the Canadian Senate (passed\r\n    15th of May, 1868) that the Governor-General should be prayed\r\n    “to impress upon Her Majesty’s Government the _justice and\r\n    expediency_ of extending the _privileges_ of the Imperial\r\n    Copyright Act, 1847, so that whenever reasonable provision and\r\n    protection shall, in Her Majesty’s opinion, be secured to the\r\n    authors, _Colonial reprints_ of British Copyright works shall\r\n    be placed on the same footing as foreign reprints in Canada, by\r\n    which means British authors will be more effectually protected\r\n    in their rights, _and a material benefit will be conferred on\r\n    the printing industry of the Dominion_.”...\r\n\r\n    All the North-American colonies soon availed themselves of this\r\n    Act of 1847, and Orders in Council were founded upon them; the\r\n    rights of British authors being deemed sufficiently protected\r\n    by an _ad valorem_ import duty of 20 per cent. upon the value\r\n    of the “foreign reprints,” that, being about _one-tenth_ of the\r\n    price of the works as published in England!\r\n\r\n    There appears to have been no debate in either House upon\r\n    this Act of 1847, and it seems to have escaped all public\r\n    notice on the part of British authors and publishers during\r\n    its progress in Parliament. From the time Her Majesty’s Orders\r\n    in Council enabled the colonies to avail themselves of that\r\n    Act, it has operated as a stimulus and considerable premium\r\n    to the “legalised robbery” of British Copyright property in\r\n    the United States, and has, practically, given printers and\r\n    publishers there a monopoly in “foreign reprints” of English\r\n    books. The Act of 1847 is, therefore, a partial confiscation of\r\n    those Copyrights which have been acquired in England under Earl\r\n    Stanhope’s Act of 1842, because the colonies have, for the last\r\n    twenty years, been almost exclusively supplied with English\r\n    books by United States reprints of those books....\r\n\r\n    In 1867 the “dominion of Canada” was created by the Imperial\r\n    Act of that year, which united all Her Majesty’s North\r\n    American Colonies. It was then found that printing had become\r\n    much cheaper in Canada than it was in the United States; and\r\n    amongst the earliest Acts of the first session of the Canadian\r\n    Parliament two statutes were passed—one, “An Act respecting\r\n    Copyrights;” and the other, “An Act to impose a Duty upon\r\n    Foreign Reprints of British Copyright Works.” Under the first\r\n    of these Acts, no work of “any person resident in Great Britain\r\n    or Ireland” is to be entitled to the protection of that Act\r\n    unless “the same _shall be printed and published in Canada_.”\r\n    And under the second of the above Acts it is sought to keep\r\n    alive the injustice of allowing “_foreign reprints_” to be\r\n    imported into Canada as a basis for that resolution of the\r\n    Canadian Parliament to which we have called attention.\r\n\r\n    Such are the facts which preceded the Canadian\r\n    “Correspondence.” It commences with the resolution which, in\r\n    effect, advocates “the _justice and expediency_” of enabling\r\n    Her Majesty’s Canadian subjects at their discretion (and\r\n    without the permission of the owners) to confiscate the\r\n    property of authors of British Copyright works upon the terms\r\n    of the publisher paying such authors a royalty of 12½ per\r\n    cent. upon the price of the Canadian reprints, that being\r\n    about _one-tenth_ of the publication price of the work in\r\n    England! It appears the “justice and expediency” of adopting\r\n    this Canadian resolution has been pressed very strongly upon\r\n    the authorities at the Colonial-office, and likewise at the\r\n    Board of Trade, by the Hon. J. Rose, the Canadian “Minister\r\n    of Finance.” He frankly admits that the policy of the Act of\r\n    1847 (so far as respects the protection of British authors)\r\n    has long been an utter failure; that the amount of duties\r\n    received for their benefit “is a mere trifle;” and that “it is\r\n    next to impracticable to enforce the law.” These statements\r\n    are confirmed by a letter, dated June 11, 1868, from Mr. John\r\n    Lovell (a Montreal publisher) to Mr. Rose, and which appears\r\n    in the Correspondence. Mr. Lovell says: “At present only a\r\n    few hundred copies pay duty, and many thousands pass into the\r\n    country without registration, and pay nothing at all; thus\r\n    having the effect of seriously injuring the publishers of\r\n    Great Britain, to the consequent advantage of those of the\r\n    United States. I may add that, on looking over the Custom-house\r\n    entries to-day, I have found that not a single entry of an\r\n    American reprint of an English Copyright (except the Reviews\r\n    and one or two magazines) has been made since the third day of\r\n    April last, though it is notorious that an edition of 1,000\r\n    of a popular work, coming under that description, has been\r\n    received and sold within the last few days by one bookseller in\r\n    this city.”\r\n\r\n    In support of the Canadian resolution, the Hon. J. Rose\r\n    likewise urges the greater cheapness now of printing in\r\n    Canada than in the United States. Upon this point he is also\r\n    confirmed by Mr. Lovell, who says: “It is undeniable that\r\n    Canadian printers would be enabled to comply with the requisite\r\n    conditions (that is, of paying a royalty of 12½ per cent. to\r\n    the author), and produce books, thanks to the local advantages,\r\n    at a much cheaper rate than they can be produced in the States,\r\n    _and so bring about a large export business_.”...\r\n\r\n    This application on the part of the Canadians is answered\r\n    at considerable length by the Board of Trade; the substance\r\n    of that answer being “that the question raised is far too\r\n    important, and involves too many considerations of imperial\r\n    policy, to render it possible to comply with that application.\r\n    My Lords, however, fully admit that the anomalous position of\r\n    Canadian publishers with respect to their rivals in the United\r\n    States of America is a matter which calls for careful inquiry;\r\n    but they feel that such an inquiry cannot be satisfactorily\r\n    undertaken without, at the same time, taking into consideration\r\n    various other questions connected with the imperial laws of\r\n    Copyright and the policy of International Copyright Treaties,\r\n    and they are, therefore, of opinion that the subject should\r\n    be treated as a whole, and that an endeavour should be made\r\n    to place the general law of Copyright, especially that part\r\n    of it which concerns the whole continent of North America,\r\n    on a more satisfactory footing. The grievance of which the\r\n    Canadian publishers complain has arisen out of the arrangement\r\n    sanctioned by Her Majesty’s Government in 1847, under which\r\n    United States reprints of English works entitled to Copyright\r\n    in the United Kingdom were admitted into Canada on payment of\r\n    an import duty, instead of being, as in the United Kingdom,\r\n    absolutely prohibited as illegal.”...\r\n\r\nA circular by Mr. Purday contains the following:—\r\n\r\n    A fact transpired only a few days since of an order being\r\n    sent for some of the musical works published in Bond-street,\r\n    on which it was stated that they _must be “American printed\r\n    copies”_.... It is said that the Americans have the means of\r\n    disposing of 30,000 or 40,000 copies of any popular book or\r\n    song they choose to reproduce. This, of course, is a fine\r\n    premium for supplanting the English publisher in the sale of\r\n    his own Copyright works in his own colonies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM A MANUSCRIPT STATEMENT BY MR. PURDAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Act of 1 and 2 Vict., c. 69, was passed into a law under the title\r\nof “An Act for securing to Authors in certain cases the benefit of\r\nInternational Copyright,” the date of which was July 31, 1838. The 14th\r\nsection is in these words: “And be it enacted, that the author of any\r\nbook to be, after the passing of this Act, _first published out of Her\r\nMajesty’s dominions_, or his assigns, _shall have no Copyright therein\r\nwithin Her Majesty’s dominions_, otherwise than such (if any) as he may\r\nbecome entitled to under this Act.” Section 9 says that no protection\r\nof Copyright shall be given to a foreign author, unless such protection\r\nshall be reciprocated to an English author by the country to which the\r\nforeign author belongs. Now, nothing can be clearer than that the Act of\r\n5 and 6 Vict., c. 45, never contemplated giving protection to a foreign\r\nauthor; but, on the contrary, that it was passed solely for the benefit\r\nof English authors.... At last the whole matter was brought before the\r\nHouse of Lords, where it was decreed that a foreign author was not an\r\nauthor within the meaning of the Acts of Parliament, and could neither\r\nclaim any Copyright himself nor assign any to an English subject, unless\r\nhe was resident in the British dominions at the time he sold his work,\r\nand published it there before there was any publication abroad. This,\r\nafter eleven years of litigation by various parties, among whom my\r\nbrother was the most persistent defendant, he being perfectly convinced\r\nthat if the subject came to be thoroughly investigated, no such claims as\r\nwere set up by the monopolists could be maintained either at common law\r\nor in equity. The House of Lords, however, were not called upon to decide\r\nwhat was meant by the term _residence_. This, therefore, gave rise to an\r\nattempt on the part of an English bookseller to contrive a scheme which,\r\nto the not very creditable honour of English jurisprudence, as it appears\r\nto my humble understanding, succeeded. The scheme was this: An American\r\nauthoress of little repute wrote a novel, one copy of the manuscript of\r\nwhich, it is said, was handed over, for a consideration, to this English\r\nbookseller, to publish in England; the work was got ready on this side\r\nof the Atlantic as well as on the other side, and, after agreeing as to\r\nthe date of entry at Stationers’ Hall, and the publication of the same in\r\nLondon, the lady was desired to go over the Victoria-bridge into Canada,\r\none of the British dominions, and remain there a few hours or days, while\r\nthe publication took place in London; then she was to go back again for\r\nthe protection of the same work, as a Copyright, in her own country.\r\nMeanwhile, another English publisher, hearing that such an artifice was\r\nabout to be attempted, procured an American copy of the said work, and\r\nrepublished it in a cheap form. The consequence was, that an application\r\nfor an injunction was applied for by the first party, which was granted,\r\nand appealed against to the Lords Justices, who gave it as their opinion\r\nthat the word “author” in the Act of Parliament was to be interpreted in\r\nits widest sense, and that there was no limitation to that word in the\r\nAct of Parliament; therefore, it was maintained that _any_ author could\r\nhave a Copyright in England who complied with the requisitions of the\r\nAct, and this defective scheme was confirmed by Lord Chancellor Cairns,\r\nwho remarked that none of the former decisions had stated that it was\r\nother than necessary to be in the British dominions during the time of\r\nthe publication of the work. This device may have facilitated the desire\r\nfor an international law upon a righteous foundation, now so loudly\r\nadvocated in America.\r\n\r\nIn the judgment given in the House of Lords, in the case of Boosey’s\r\nassumption to the exclusive right of printing the opera of Bellini,\r\nthe subject of residence in England was debated, and Lord St. Leonards\r\nused these remarkable words: “Now the American Legislature have no such\r\ndifficulty. They have expressly enacted that Copyright there shall be\r\nconfined to natives, or persons resident within the United States. Those\r\nare the express words of their statute.” And we may remark, farther, that\r\nunless an alien author has resided at least twelve months in America, and\r\nhas made a declaration in these words, “I do declare on oath that it is\r\n_bonâ fide_ my intention to become a citizen of the United States,” &c.,\r\nhe cannot obtain the privilege of Copyright in anything he may publish\r\nthere. This conflict of opinion must necessarily end, therefore, in a new\r\nAct of Parliament, which has been long needed to settle this and other\r\nmuch-vexed questions of Copyright.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM THE SAME.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              24, Great Marlborough-street, June 15, 1869.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,—I think your suggestion of the payment of a royalty upon the\r\npublication of an author’s work, if made mutual in both America and\r\nGreat Britain, would go far to reconcile the two nations to abandon the\r\npresent unfair reprisals; more especially if it were left to the option\r\nof any publisher to reproduce such works in the form most suited to his\r\nparticular trade. Some publishers choose to publish in one form, and some\r\nin another, more or less expensive, according to the taste or want of\r\ntheir customers. It is true, there might be some difficulty in arranging\r\nthe percentage per copy upon such a scheme; but that might be regulated\r\naccording to the price and style of getting up of the work, which should\r\nalways be determined upon before the work is issued.\r\n\r\nThe question of Copyright in music is one which presents features\r\nappertaining to itself exclusively. One feature which it shares along\r\nwith the other fine arts is this great fact: that music is a universal\r\nlanguage, and addresses itself equally to all nations. Its range,\r\ntherefore, is far wider than literature. It needs no translation.\r\n\r\nThe taste for music is more widely diffused than that for painting and\r\nsculpture, from which it differs in a way that causes very considerable\r\nembarrassment when the question of Copyright comes to be particularly\r\ndealt with. Like paintings and statues, music may be reproduced in a\r\npermanent form; but, unlike them, the chief value of its Copyright\r\nprivilege is reproduction in sounds, and, therefore, in a form\r\nunsubstantial and transient. He, therefore, who would deal satisfactorily\r\nwith this branch of the wide question of Copyright has to provide for a\r\ndemand, and overcome difficulties, such as do not belong to literary and\r\nartistic Copyright. But, still further, music—say that of an opera—may be\r\nseparated into parts without serious diminution of its revenue-bearing\r\nvalue. Once more, there is the _libretto_; it belongs to the range of\r\nliterature. Questions, therefore, arise, and must be provided for, with\r\nrespect to the affinity of that part with the music, its reproduction in\r\nthe form of translation, and its being, as it occasionally is, the work\r\nand property of an author other than the composer of the music.\r\n\r\nThere is still so much uncertainty, approaching to confusion, as to what\r\nreally is the law, especially with regard to international Copyright,\r\nin this branch, that thorough revision and immediate international\r\nnegotiations are absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\nThe laws of Copyright should be divested of all ambiguity and superfluous\r\nlegal verbiage. In fact, they should be made so plain that “he that runs\r\nmay read,” and understand them. The payment of a royalty on foreign works\r\nis not a new thing here. Chappell pays 1s. a copy, besides a considerable\r\nsum for the Copyright, of the last work of Rossini—viz., the “Messe\r\nSolennelle,” for the exclusive selling of the work, and for the right of\r\nperforming it here. Any other information I can give you I shall be happy\r\nto afford.\r\n\r\n                    I am, dear Sir, yours obediently,\r\n\r\n                                                             C. H. PURDAY.\r\n\r\nTo R. A. Macfie, Esq., M.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACTS FROM CORRESPONDENCE ON COPYRIGHT LAW IN CANADA.\r\n\r\nLAID BEFORE THE CANADIAN PARLIAMENT BY COMMAND OF HIS EXCELLENCY THE\r\nGOVERNOR-GENERAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Extract from a Report of a Committee of the Honourable the Privy Council\r\nof Canada, approved by His Excellency the Governor-General in Council, on\r\nthe 27th May, 1868._\r\n\r\n“On the recommendation of the Honourable the Minister of Customs, the\r\nCommittee advise an uniform _ad valorem_ duty throughout this Dominion\r\nof 12½ per cent., being the rate fixed and collected in the Province of\r\nCanada, previous to the Confederation of the Provinces—and to establish\r\nsuch regulations and conditions as may be subsistent with any Act of\r\nthe Parliament of the United Kingdom then in force as may be deemed\r\nrequisite and equitable with regard to the admission of such books, and\r\nto the distribution of the proceeds of such duty to or among the party or\r\nparties _beneficially_ interested in the Copyright.”\r\n\r\n\r\n(_From Memorandum by the Minister of Finance._)\r\n\r\n“Not one-tenth part of the reprints which find their way to Canada are\r\nentered at the Custom-house, or pay duty.... It is proposed, in order\r\nperfectly to secure the English author, that every Canadian publisher who\r\nreprints English Copyrights should take out a licence, and that effectual\r\npractical checks should be interposed, so that the duty on the number of\r\ncopies actually issued from the press should be paid into the Canadian\r\nGovernment by Canadian publishers for the benefit of the English authors.\r\nIt is believed that the English authors would benefit enormously by the\r\nproposed change. At present the amount received by Canada for duty on\r\nEnglish Copyrights, and paid over by Canada to the Imperial Government\r\nfor the benefit of English authors, is a mere trifle.”\r\n\r\n\r\n(_From Mr. Lovell._)\r\n\r\n                                                 “Montreal, June 11, 1868.\r\n\r\n“In 1849, I believe, the Government of Canada, with the sanction of Her\r\nMajesty the Queen, gave United States publishers the right to bring\r\nreprints of English Copyright works into this country on payment of\r\nCustoms duty of 15 per cent., which has since been reduced to 12½ per\r\ncent., the proceeds of the duties to be forwarded to the English authors\r\nas a compensation for the privileges secured to the American publishers.\r\n\r\n“The people of the Dominion, and especially the printing and publishing\r\ninterests, feel that they ought to possess at least equal privileges to\r\nthose conceded to the foreigner. There are several establishments in\r\nthe Dominion that would esteem it a great boon to be allowed to reprint\r\nEnglish Copyrights on the same terms as are now secured to United States\r\npublishers, and would gladly pay the 12½ per cent. to the English authors\r\non the _total number_ of copies printed, sure to be very considerable. At\r\npresent only a few hundred copies pay duty, but many thousands pass into\r\nthe country without registration, and pay nothing at all; thus having\r\nthe effect of seriously injuring the publishers of Great Britain, to the\r\nconsequent advantage of those of the United States.”\r\n\r\n\r\n(_Extract from Letter from Sir Louis Mallet to the Under-Secretary of\r\nState, C.O._)\r\n\r\n“It is obvious that, looking to the geographical position of the United\r\nStates and the North American Confederation, any arrangement with respect\r\nto Copyright which does not apply to both must be always imperfect and\r\nunsatisfactory, and it is therefore extremely desirable, if possible,\r\nthat the Canadian question should be considered in connexion with any\r\nnegotiations conducted with the United States Government.\r\n\r\n“Another serious objection to the sanction by Her Majesty’s Government\r\nof such a proposal appears to my Lords to be, that, while the public\r\npolicy of the mother-country enforces an absolute monopoly in works\r\nof literature for a term of years, it is very undesirable to admit in\r\nBritish Colonial possessions an arrangement which, whatever advantages\r\nit may possess (and my Lords fully admit that much may be said in its\r\nfavour), rests upon a wholly different principle.\r\n\r\n“It would be difficult, if such a principle were admitted in the British\r\nColonies, to refuse to recognise it in the case of foreign countries, and\r\nthus it might come to pass that the British public might be called upon\r\nto pay a high price for their books, in order to afford what is held to\r\nbe the necessary encouragement to British authors, while the subjects of\r\nother countries and the Colonial subjects of Her Majesty would enjoy the\r\nadvantages of cheap British literature provided for them at the expense\r\nof the inhabitants of the United Kingdom.”\r\n\r\n\r\n(_Extract from a Paper by the Minister of Finance on the Copyright-Law in\r\nCanada._)\r\n\r\n“The consequence of this anomalous state of the Law is that Canada\r\nreceives large supplies of American reprints of English Copyright books,\r\nwhich are sold at a much higher rate than if printed in Canada; while, at\r\nthe same time, so generally is the payment of the 12½ per cent. Customs\r\nduty evaded, and so trifling is the whole amount realised from that\r\nsource (the total received last year for the whole Dominion of Canada\r\nbeing only $799.43, or 164_l._ 5s. 3d. sterling, the average of the\r\npreceding four years being only 115_l._ 1s. 3d., sterling), that so far\r\nas regards the pecuniary or other interests of English authors, for whose\r\nprotection the duty was imposed and in whose behalf it is collected, the\r\neffect is practically the same as if the reprints were avowedly admitted\r\nduty free....\r\n\r\n“It is believed that if this privilege were extended to Canadian\r\npublishers, they would avail themselves of it to a very large extent, and\r\nas the Excise duty of 12½ per cent. could, under proper regulations, be\r\nvery easily levied, a substantial revenue would accrue therefrom for the\r\nbenefit of English authors; and further, that a great impetus would be\r\ngiven to the interests of printers, publishers, paper manufacturers, type\r\nfounders, and other important kindred branches of material industry, and\r\nindirectly to the interests of literature and literary men....\r\n\r\n“An American or any other foreign author, by publishing his work first\r\nin the United Kingdom, may obtain for himself all the benefits of the\r\nEnglish Copyright-Law. One of those benefits, as the law now stands, is\r\nto prohibit its reprint in any portion of Her Majesty’s dominions out of\r\nthe United Kingdom. He can equally procure its Copyright in the United\r\nStates, and the consequence is that the price of literature is enhanced\r\nto British subjects in all Her Majesty’s Colonial possessions, since to\r\nthem and to them only can the prohibition to republish apply or be made\r\neffectual.\r\n\r\n“England does not confine the protection which she thus extends to her\r\nown authors. The foreign author is protected against all her Colonial\r\nsubjects, provided he publishes first within the confines of Great\r\nBritain and Ireland. She will not recognise a publication in a Colonial\r\npossession as a compliance with the Copyright Act, but limits the place\r\nof publication to the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\n“Such the undersigned understands to have been the solemn interpretation\r\nof the law by the House of Lords in the recent case of ‘Routledge and\r\nLowe’ (‘New Law Report,’ Appeal Cases, vol. ii., pp. 100-121), and he\r\nwould very strongly call attention to the unfair position in which the\r\npolicy of that law places the Canadian publisher and the Canadian public.\r\n\r\n“The mere circumstance of the publishing in the United Kingdom gives\r\nthe author a monopoly throughout the entire area of the British\r\ndominions—that author, in the opinion of the then Lord Chancellor Cairns,\r\nneed not be a native-born subject of the Crown; he need not be an alien\r\nfriend sojourning in the United Kingdom; he need not be sojourning\r\nin a British Colony, but he may be a foreigner residing abroad. This\r\nprotection is afforded, in the language of Lord Cairns, to induce the\r\nauthor to publish his work in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\n“If the policy of England, in relation to Copyright, is to stimulate, by\r\nmeans of the protection secured to literary labour, the composition of\r\nworks of learning and utility, that policy is not incompatible with such\r\na modification of law as will place the Colonial publisher on a footing\r\nof equality not only with the publisher in the United States, but even\r\nwith the publisher in the United Kingdom....\r\n\r\n“If the rate of duty, whether import or excise, were inadequate, it would\r\nbe an equally reasonable argument against the extension of the law; and\r\nin that case the rate could be augmented.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTENDENCIES OF COPYRIGHT AMENDERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat pretensions under Copyright are becoming so formidable as to\r\ndemand very serious attention on the part of statesmen and of all who\r\ndesire to maintain the integrity of our national inheritance of a\r\nworld-wide, heartily-united empire, and imperial freedom from odious,\r\ninquisitorial, and impracticable restraints, especially such as might\r\nhinder intellectual and moral development, will be evident to any person\r\nwho takes pains to study and follow out to their necessary consequences\r\nthe provisions contained in the following transcripts from a Bill lately\r\nintroduced by an ex-Lord Chancellor, “for Consolidating and Amending the\r\nLaw of Copyright in Works of Fine Art:”\r\n\r\n    _Fine Arts Copyright Consolidation and Amendment._ [32 Vict.]\r\n\r\n    Design.—An original conception represented by the author\r\n    thereof in any work of fine art.\r\n\r\n    Drawing or Painting.—Every original drawing or painting, made\r\n    in any manner and material, and by any process.\r\n\r\n    Photograph shall mean and include every original photograph.\r\n\r\n    Sculpture.—Every original work, either in the round, in relief,\r\n    or intaglio, made in any material, and by any process.\r\n\r\n    Engraving.—Every original engraving and lithograph made upon a\r\n    plate, block, or slab, of any material, by any process, whereby\r\n    impressions may be taken from such plate, block, or slab, and\r\n    the impressions taken from the same.\r\n\r\n    Work of Fine Art.—Every drawing, painting, photograph, work of\r\n    sculpture, and engraving as herein-before interpreted.\r\n\r\n    Extending to all parts of the United Kingdom of Great Britain\r\n    and Ireland, the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, and _all\r\n    the colonies_ and possessions of the Crown which now are, or\r\n    hereafter may be, created or acquired.\r\n\r\n    3. The author of every original work of fine art, if made, or\r\n    first sold, after the commencement of this Act, such author\r\n    being a British subject, or resident within any part of the\r\n    British dominions at the time such work shall be made or first\r\n    sold, and the assigns of such author, shall have the Copyright\r\n    of sole and exclusive right of copying, reproducing, and\r\n    multiplying such work, and the design thereof, in the British\r\n    dominions, by any means, and of any size, for the term of the\r\n    natural life of such author, and thirty years after his death,\r\n    but subject to the following conditions and restrictions; (that\r\n    is to say), &c.\r\n\r\n    9. If the author of any work of fine art in which there shall\r\n    be subsisting Copyright, after having become divested of such\r\n    Copyright, or if any other person, not being the proprietor for\r\n    the time being of the Copyright in any work of fine art, shall\r\n    by any means unlawfully repeat, copy, imitate, or otherwise\r\n    multiply for sale, hire, exhibition, or _distribution_, or\r\n    cause or procure to be repeated, copied, imitated, or otherwise\r\n    multiplied for sale, hire, exhibition, or distribution,\r\n    any such work, or the design thereof, _or any part of such\r\n    design_, or, knowing that any such repetition, copy, or other\r\n    imitation has been unlawfully made, shall _import_ or export\r\n    into or out of _any part of the British dominions_, or sell,\r\n    publish, let to hire, exhibit, or distribute, or offer for\r\n    sale, hire, exhibition, or distribution, or cause or procure\r\n    to be so imported, or exported, or sold, published, let to\r\n    hire, distributed, or offered for sale, hire, exhibition, or\r\n    distribution, any unlawful repetition, copy, or imitation of\r\n    any such work, or of the design thereof, such person for every\r\n    such offence shall forfeit to the registered proprietor for the\r\n    time being of the Copyright thereof a sum not exceeding twenty\r\n    pounds, and not less than two pounds, for every first offence,\r\n    and not less than five pounds, for every subsequent offence, &c.\r\n\r\n    11. All repetitions, copies, or imitations of any work of fine\r\n    art, or the design thereof, wherein there shall be subsisting\r\n    Copyright under this Act, and which, contrary to the provisions\r\n    of this Act, shall have been made in any foreign State, are\r\n    hereby absolutely prohibited to be imported into any part of\r\n    the British dominions, except by or with the consent of the\r\n    registered proprietor of the Copyright thereof, or his agent\r\n    authorised in writing; and if the registered proprietor for the\r\n    time being of any such Copyright or his agent shall declare,\r\n    _or if any officer of Her Majesty’s Customs shall suspect_,\r\n    that any goods imported are prohibited repetitions, copies,\r\n    or imitations of any such work of fine art, or of the design\r\n    thereof, then _such goods may be detained_, unpacked, and\r\n    examined by the officers of Her Majesty’s Customs.\r\n\r\n    12. The _Commissioners of Customs_ shall cause to be made, and\r\n    _publicly exposed at the several ports_ of the United Kingdom,\r\n    _and in Her Majesty’s possessions abroad, printed lists of all\r\n    works of fine art wherein Copyright shall be subsisting_, and\r\n    as to which the registered _proprietor_ for the time being of\r\n    such Copyright, _or his agent_, shall have given notice in\r\n    writing to the said Commissioners that such Copyright exists,\r\n    stating in such notice when such Copyright expires, and shall\r\n    have made and subscribed a declaration before the collector of\r\n    the Customs, or any justice of the peace, at some port or place\r\n    in the United Kingdom or in Her Majesty’s possessions abroad,\r\n    that the contents of such notice are true. The provisions\r\n    contained in the Acts now in force, or at any time to be in\r\n    force, regarding Her Majesty’s Customs, as to the application\r\n    to the courts and judges by any person aggrieved by the entry\r\n    of any book in the lists of books to be made and publicly\r\n    exposed by the said Commissioners under the said Acts, and\r\n    the expunging any such entry, shall apply to the entry of any\r\n    work of fine art in the lists thereof to be made by virtue of\r\n    this Act, in the same manner as if such provisions were herein\r\n    expressly enacted, with all necessary variations in relation to\r\n    such last-mentioned lists, &c.\r\n\r\n    13. _Every person who shall import_ or export, or cause to be\r\n    imported or exported, into or out of any part of the British\r\n    dominions, or shall _exchange_, publish, sell, let to hire,\r\n    _exhibit_, or _distribute_, or offer, or hawk, or carry\r\n    about, or keep for sale, hire, exhibition, or distribution,\r\n    any unlawful copy, repetition, or imitation of any work of\r\n    fine art, in which, or in the design whereof, there shall be\r\n    subsisting registered Copyright, shall be bound, on demand in\r\n    writing, delivered to him or left for him at his last known\r\n    dwelling-house or place of business, by or on behalf of the\r\n    registered proprietor for the time being of such Copyright,\r\n    to give to the person requiring the same, or his attorney\r\n    or agent, within forty-eight hours after such demand, _full\r\n    information in writing of the name and address of the person\r\n    from whom, and of the times when, he shall have imported,\r\n    purchased, or obtained_ such unlawful copy, repetition, or\r\n    imitation, also the number of such copies, repetitions, or\r\n    imitations which he has obtained, and also to produce to the\r\n    person requiring such information all invoices, books, and\r\n    other documents relating to the same; and it shall be lawful\r\n    for any justice of the peace, on information on oath of such\r\n    demand having been made, and of the refusal or neglect to\r\n    comply therewith, to summon before him the person guilty of\r\n    such refusal or neglect, and on being satisfied that such\r\n    demand ought to be complied with, to order such information to\r\n    be given and such production to be made within a reasonable\r\n    time to be fixed by him.\r\n\r\n    14. Upon proof by the oath of _one credible person_ before _any\r\n    justice of the peace_, court, sheriff, or other person having\r\n    jurisdiction in any proceeding under this Act that there is\r\n    reasonable cause to _suspect_ that _any person has in his\r\n    possession_, or in any house, shop, or other place for sale,\r\n    hire, distribution, or public exhibition, any copy, repetition,\r\n    or imitation of any work of fine art in which, _or in the\r\n    design whereof_, there shall be subsisting and registered\r\n    Copyright under this Act, and that such copy, repetition, or\r\n    imitation has been made without the consent in writing of the\r\n    registered proprietor of such Copyright, it shall be lawful\r\n    for such justice, court, sheriff, or other person as aforesaid\r\n    before whom any such proceeding is taken, and he or they is and\r\n    are hereby required to _grant his or their warrant, to search\r\n    in the daytime such house_, shop, or other place, and if any\r\n    such copy, repetition, or imitation, or any work which may be\r\n    reasonably suspected to be such, shall be found therein, to\r\n    cause the same to be brought before him or them, or before some\r\n    other justice of the peace, court, sheriff, or other person as\r\n    aforesaid, &c.\r\n\r\n    15. If any person, elsewhere than at his own house, shop,\r\n    or place of business, shall hawk, carry about, offer,\r\n    utter, _distribute_, or sell, or keep for sale, hire, or\r\n    _distribution_, _any_ unlawful copy, repetition, or _colourable\r\n    imitation_ of any work of fine art in which, or in the design\r\n    whereof, there shall be subsisting and registered Copyright\r\n    under this Act, all such unlawful articles may be _seized\r\n    without warrant, by any peace officer, or the proprietor of\r\n    the Copyright, or any person authorised by him_, and forthwith\r\n    taken before any justice of the peace, court, sheriff, &c.\r\n\r\n    23. Under this Act there shall be kept at the hall of the\r\n    Stationers’ Company by the registrar appointed by the said\r\n    company for the purposes of the Act passed in the sixth year of\r\n    the reign of her present Majesty, intituled “An Act to amend\r\n    the Law of Copyright,” three several books or sets of books,\r\n    which shall be called as follows:\r\n\r\n        (1.) The register of proprietors of Copyright in\r\n        original drawings and pictures:\r\n\r\n        (2.) The register of proprietors of Copyright in\r\n        original photographs and engravings:\r\n\r\n        (3.) The register of proprietors of Copyright in\r\n        original works of sculpture.\r\n\r\n    In the first of such registers shall be entered a memorandum of\r\n    every Copyright, _or of any limited legal interest therein_, to\r\n    which any person shall claim to be entitled under this Act in\r\n    any original drawing or painting, and also of _any subsequent\r\n    assignment_ of such Copyright or _limited legal interest\r\n    therein_; and such memorandum shall contain a statement of the\r\n    several particulars required by the form applicable for that\r\n    purpose in Part I. of the third schedule to this Act; and in\r\n    addition thereto the person registering shall annex to the\r\n    memorandum under which he requires the entry to be made an\r\n    outline, sketch, or photograph of the drawing or painting to\r\n    which such memorandum refers, &c.\r\n\r\n⁂ Again adverting to the case of Ireland, let it be remembered it was\r\nonly so late as 1836 that an Act was passed “to extend the protection of\r\nCopyright in prints and engravings to Ireland.”\r\n\r\nThis Bill of Lord Westbury’s, after having been referred to a Select\r\nCommittee of the House of Lords, has been withdrawn, but only for the\r\npresent Session. The reason for withdrawal is found in amendments\r\nrecommended by the Committee, one of which is that it should extend only\r\nto the United Kingdom and Channel Islands. The subjoined extracts from a\r\nprinted defence of the Bill, by D. Roberton Blaine, Esq., will be read\r\nwith interest, as showing how influential is the quarter whence the Bill\r\nemanates, and not less on account of their allusion to Patent-right and\r\ntheir other interesting contents.\r\n\r\n    This Bill has been prepared by direction of the Council of the\r\n    Society of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce, in consequence of\r\n    a memorial having been presented to the Council, signed by a\r\n    considerable number of the most eminent artists and publishers\r\n    resident in London....\r\n\r\n    There is no Copyright in the _ideas_ embodied in a work of\r\n    literature or of fine art....\r\n\r\n    It is quite otherwise according to our Patent-Laws. Under them\r\n    the _idea_ of an author is everything, so to speak, and is\r\n    rigidly protected. Thus, for example, suppose A produces a new\r\n    manufacture by means of a very imperfect and clumsy machine,\r\n    or chemical process, which he invents and patents; and suppose\r\n    afterwards that B invents a very perfect and simple machine, or\r\n    chemical process, whereby he can produce the same manufacture\r\n    as A, but better and cheaper than his. In such a case the\r\n    Patent-Laws prohibit B from making any use of his improvement\r\n    for making the manufacture of A during the continuance of his\r\n    Patent, unless with his consent. This arises from its being\r\n    a leading _principle_ of our Patent-Laws, that where a new\r\n    invention has been secured by a valid and existing Patent no\r\n    one is allowed during the continuance of that Patent to produce\r\n    _the same results by a mechanical or chemical equivalent_.\r\n    Hence the great source of complaints and of the litigation\r\n    arising under our Patent-Laws. Thus it is that a patented\r\n    manufacture precludes any improvements therein except by the\r\n    patentee, or with his consent, during the term of his Patent....\r\n\r\n    In Italy, at the expiration of such forty years, although any\r\n    one may then make and sell copies of the work, the person doing\r\n    so must, during a second term of forty years, annually pay to\r\n    the proprietor of the Copyright 5 per cent. (calculated at the\r\n    _published_ price) upon all copies sold by the person so making\r\n    and selling such copies. As to France, her Copyright-Laws are\r\n    expressly extended to all her colonies. And, by the 8th Article\r\n    of Her Majesty the Queen’s Copyright Convention with France,\r\n    dated 3rd November, 1851, _reciprocal_ protection is agreed to\r\n    be given in favour of Copyright works _first_ published in “the\r\n    territories of France,” or in “the British dominions.” This\r\n    appears to show that both States clearly intended that such\r\n    reciprocal protection should extend to their colonies. It is\r\n    also stipulated by the 7th Article that “pirated works _shall\r\n    be seized_ and destroyed.” Now the French law very justly\r\n    declares the piracy of Copyright property to be a _crime_\r\n    (_delit_), and provides rapid and effectual means for enabling\r\n    the proprietor of the Copyright to seize both the pirate\r\n    and the fraudulent copies, plates, &c., in his possession.\r\n    Yet, according to the present state of the British Artistic\r\n    Copyright-Laws, no such powers of seizure, as expressly agreed\r\n    by Her Majesty the Queen’s Convention, exist in the British\r\n    dominions; nor does any protection whatever for _artistic_\r\n    Copyright works extend beyond the United Kingdom; no, not even\r\n    to the Isle of Man, or to the Channel Islands!\r\n\r\nThis important and novel subject is likely soon to receive useful\r\nillustration from a Parliamentary return to be moved for by the Right\r\nHon. T. H. Headlam. From another of that gentleman’s Returns a\r\nsuggestive extract is also subjoined.\r\n\r\nIt contains evidence that long ago impatience of existing restraints\r\nwas in vigorous action in the British Colonies—evidence that payment of\r\nauthors by royalties is a system that commands State concurrence—and\r\nevidence how over-ready the State is, or how circumstances are formed so\r\nas to compel it, to undertake work for authors and publishers by means\r\nof its Custom-house officers. On this last point I am happy also to\r\nproduce an important paper kindly furnished by Michael Daly, Esq., of Her\r\nMajesty’s Customs. Mr. Daly’s note deserves to be pondered in prospect\r\nof the re-appearance next Session of the Board of Trade’s “Trade-Marks\r\nRegistration Bill.”[11]\r\n\r\nThe extracts which I have agglomerated show that the idea of employing\r\nofficers of _Excise_ as well as those of Customs is seriously propounded,\r\nbut this is by no means all the useful information they convey.\r\n\r\n[11] Would it not be well to confine registration to _names_ of firms or\r\npremises without recognising _marks_?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLONIAL DUTIES ON COPYRIGHT WORKS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Return of all the Colonies and British Possessions in favour of which\r\nOrders in Council have been issued under the Act 10 and 11 Vict., c.\r\n95, suspending the Prohibition of Importation of Reprints of British\r\nCopyright Works._\r\n\r\n    NEW BRUNSWICK.—An _ad valorem_ duty of 20 per cent. on the\r\n    _bonâ fide_ price of the publication, imposed on importation;\r\n    such duty to be transmitted through Her Majesty’s Government\r\n    for the benefit of the author.\r\n\r\n    NOVA SCOTIA.—An _ad valorem_ duty of 20 per cent. to be applied\r\n    in like manner.\r\n\r\n    PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND.—An _ad valorem_ duty of 20 per cent.,\r\n    currency of the island, imposed on similar terms.\r\n\r\n    BARBADOES.—An _ad valorem_ duty of 20 per cent. to be remitted\r\n    to the author.\r\n\r\n    BERMUDA.—An _ad valorem_ duty of 15 per cent. on the value of\r\n    such reprints, imposed on the like conditions, a deduction of 5\r\n    per cent. on the amount to be made, for the remuneration of the\r\n    officers collecting the duty.\r\n\r\n    BAHAMAS.—A duty of 20 per cent. on the value of the publisher’s\r\n    wholesale price; nine-tenths of the amount collected to be paid\r\n    to the proprietors of the Copyright on their application to the\r\n    Governor.\r\n\r\n    NEWFOUNDLAND.—An _ad valorem_ duty of 20 per cent. to be paid\r\n    over to the author.\r\n\r\n    ST.

Among\r\nothers they have to take care that foreign goods, on their importation,\r\ndo not bear the mark or brand of any British maker, or such marks or\r\nbrands as would be likely to give them a British character. All goods so\r\nmarked and branded are, by 16 and 17 Vict., cap. 107, sec. 44, prohibited\r\nto be imported into this country. Cases are constantly occurring where\r\nsuch goods have to be dealt with by the Customs’ authorities. In some\r\ninstances the goods are confiscated, in others the brands or labels are\r\nordered to be removed, upon which the goods are delivered to the owner,\r\neither with or without fine; and in other cases they are ordered to be\r\nreturned to the port whence they were imported. But why should this duty\r\ndevolve upon the Customs’ officers? It is an extremely disagreeable one,\r\ninvolving much trouble to the department and vexation to importers. If\r\na manufacturer or dealer in this country infringes the right of another\r\nby using his mark or brand, he has his remedy in a court of justice;\r\nbut he has no right to enter a factory or warehouse, to open packages\r\nand make an indiscriminate search, with or without grounds of suspicion\r\nthat his brands have been placed on the contents of the packages. Yet,\r\npractically, this is really the case with regard to the Customs’ right\r\nof search for prohibited marks and brands. Why not let the goods pass\r\nwithout reference to brands or marks? Leave the owner of the marks to his\r\nremedy in law; and the vendor of the goods bearing such forged or false\r\nbrands to the risk and penalty which he thus incurs. In this case the\r\nfraudulent dealer only will be the sufferer, while the innocent will be\r\nsaved the vexation of having his goods pulled about at the Custom-house;\r\nand the Customs department will be relieved of an extremely disagreeable\r\nand troublesome duty. As to the brand, not those of any particular maker,\r\nbut in their general character purporting the goods to be of British\r\nmanufacture, but very little harm can result to any particular interest\r\nfrom the use of such marks. It will take something more substantial than\r\nsuch mere fictions to ruin the trade of the country; but if better goods,\r\neven if they be of foreign origin, can be obtained at the same prices as\r\nthose paid for British, then so much the better for the consumer. Would\r\nit not be well, also, to relieve the Customs officers of the duty of\r\nsearching for pirated works under the Copyright Act? Why not deal with\r\nthe vendors here of such works, if reprinted abroad, in like manner as if\r\nreprinted here?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BRITISH AND FOREIGN BOOK TRADE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following

protection:—\r\n\r\nBOOKS PRINTED IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, EXPORTED THEREFROM.\r\n\r\n  ---------------------+-------------------------+-------------------------\r\n      COUNTRIES        |

Imports and Exports are stated.\r\n\r\nThe total weight of the Book Trade of Christendom appears to be less\r\nthan 200,000 cwts., which, taken at 1 lb. per volume, makes only about\r\n20,000,000 of volumes, about a fourth part of which is sent from this\r\ncountry to the North American and Australian “Markets.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Beehive_, of 31st July, has an article on the meeting referred to in\r\nthe Prefatory Note. The following is an extract, to which three notes are\r\nrespectfully subjoined:—\r\n\r\n    ... But to abolish all protection to original inventions would\r\n    be, as Mr. Paterson justly contended, to hand over all the\r\n    profits arising from such inventions to the capitalist.[14]\r\n    This speaker would make the granting of Patents free from\r\n    charge, and lay a tax on the profits of the contrivance\r\n    patented. Mr. Macfie, the Member for Leith, made a decided hit\r\n    when he pointed to the absence of royalties abroad, while at\r\n    home they lie upon us with a crushing weight; and, if we cannot\r\n    find ease without following the example of Switzerland in\r\n    abolishing Patent-Laws, and of Holland and Germany by declaring\r\n    against them, there will be no help for it.\r\n\r\n    But when Mr. Macfie “denies that the inventor has any exclusive\r\n    right to his invention,” he makes an assertion that it is in\r\n    the power of any inventor practically to disprove. Say that\r\n    A has found out an invention of value, or, which is the same\r\n    thing for the purpose of argument, thinks he has; he meets\r\n    with the Member for Leith, who says, “Come, my fine fellow,\r\n    out with that invention of yours, for the general good; you\r\n    have no exclusive right to it.” What would A be likely to say\r\n    in reply? “Haven’t I? Let me choose to keep it to myself, and\r\n    who can hinder me?” While, however, it is perfect nonsense\r\n    to deny a man’s right to the ideas of his own mind,[15] the\r\n    practical question is another thing; and it behoves us all to\r\n    remember that we are members of one society, and that a society\r\n    called at least Christian. Nevertheless, if A is to make his\r\n    contribution to the general good, all the rest of the alphabet\r\n    are bound to reciprocate his liberality.[16]...\r\n\r\n[14] For capitalist, if there were no Patents, why not say _consumer_?\r\n\r\n[15] It is _exclusive_ right, not at all his personal right, to use, and\r\nright to conceal, if he has the will and power, that is denied.\r\n\r\n[16] These concluding sound reflections are eminently suggestive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Abuse of Patents, 39, 46, 47\r\n\r\n  Agricultural Interest Concerned, 51\r\n\r\n  ARMSTRONG, Sir W.,
