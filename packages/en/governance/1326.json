As the revolution recedes into\r\nthe past the process of change slackens speed. Russia is no longer the\r\ndizzying kaleidoscope that it was in 1917. No longer does it change\r\nvisibly from week to week as it changed in 19l8. Already, to get a clear\r\nvision of the direction in which it is changing, it is necessary to\r\nvisit it at intervals of six months, and quite useless to tap the\r\npolitical barometer several times a day as once upon a time one used to\r\ndo.... But it is still changing very fast. My journal of \"Russia in\r\n1919,\" while giving as I believe a fairly accurate picture of the state\r\nof affairs in February and March of 1919, pictures a very different\r\nstage in the development of the revolution from that which would be\r\nfound by observers today.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe prolonged state of crisis in which the country has been kept by\r\nexternal war, while strengthening the ruling party by rallying even\r\ntheir enemies to their support, has had the other effects that a\r\nnational crisis always has on the internal politics of a country.\r\nMethods of government which in normal times would no doubt be softened\r\nor disguised by ceremonial usage are used nakedly and justified\r\nby necessity. We have seen the same thing in belligerent and\r\nnon-revolutionary countries, and, for the impartial student, it has been\r\ninteresting to observe that, when this test of crisis is applied, the\r\nactual governmental machine in every country looks very much like that\r\nin every other. They wave different flags to stimulate enthusiasm and\r\nto justify submission. But that is all. Under the stress of war,\r\n\"constitutional safeguards\" go by the board \"for the public good,\" in\r\nMoscow as elsewhere. Under that stress it becomes clear that, in spite\r\nof its novel constitution, Russia is governed much as other countries\r\nare governed, the real directive power lying in the hands of a\r\ncomparatively small body which is able by hook or crook to infect with\r\nits conscious will a population largely indifferent and inert. A visitor\r\nto Moscow to-day would find much of the constitutional machinery that\r\nwas in full working order in the spring of 1919 now falling into rust\r\nand disrepair. He would not be able once a week or so to attend All-Russian\r\nExecutive and hear discussions in this parliament of the questions of\r\nthe day. No one tries to shirk the fact that the Executive Committee has\r\nfallen into desuetude, from which, when the stress slackens enough to\r\npermit ceremonial that has not an immediate agitational value, it may\r\nsome day be revived. The bulk of its members have been at the front or\r\nhere and there about the country wrestling with the economic problem,\r\nand their work is more useful than their chatter. Thus brutally is the\r\nthing stated. The continued stress has made the muscles, the actual\r\nworks, of the revolution more visible than formerly. The working of the\r\nmachine is not only seen more clearly, but is also more frankly stated\r\n(perhaps simply because they too see it now more clearly), by the\r\nleaders themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nI want in this book to describe the working of the machine as I now see\r\nit. But it is not only the machine which is more nakedly visible than\r\nit was. The stress to which it is being subjected has also not so much\r\nchanged its character as become easier of analysis. At least, I seem to\r\nmyself to see it differently. In the earlier days it seemed quite simply\r\nthe struggle between a revolutionary and non-revolutionary countries. I\r\nnow think that that struggle is a foolish, unnecessary, lunatic incident\r\nwhich disguised from us the existence of a far more serious struggle, in\r\nwhich the revolutionary and non-revolutionary governments are fighting\r\non the same side. They fight without cooperation, and throw insults\r\nand bullets at each other in the middle of the struggle, but they are\r\nfighting for the same thing. They are fighting the same enemy.\r\nTheir quarrel with each other is for both parties merely a harassing\r\naccompaniment of the struggle to which all Europe is committed, for the\r\nsalvage of what is left of European civilization.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe threat of a complete collapse of civilization is more imminent in\r\nRussia than elsewhere. But it is clear enough in Poland, it cannot be\r\ndisregarded in Germany, there is no doubt of its existence in Italy,\r\nFrance is conscious of it; it is only in England and America that this\r\nthreat is not among the waking nightmares of everybody. Unless the\r\nstruggle, which has hitherto been going against us, takes a turn for the\r\nbetter, we shall presently be quite unable to ignore it ourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have tried to state the position in Russia today: on the one hand to\r\ndescribe the crisis itself, the threat which is forcing these people to\r\nan extreme of effort, and on the other hand to describe the organization\r\nthat is facing that threat; on the one hand to set down what are the\r\nmain characteristics of the crisis, on the other hand to show how the\r\ncomparatively small body of persons actually supplying the Russian\r\npeople with its directives set about the stupendous task of moving that\r\nvast inert mass, not along the path of least resistance, but along a\r\npath which, while alike unpleasant and extremely difficult, does seem to\r\nthem to promise some sort of eventual escape.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo book is entirely objective, so I do not in the least mind stating my\r\nown reason for writing this one (which has taken time that I should have\r\nliked to spend on other and very different things). Knowledge of this\r\nreason will permit the reader to make allowances for such bias I have\r\nbeen unable to avoid, and so, by judicious reading, to make my book\r\nperhaps nearly as objective as I should myself wish it to be.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been said that when two armies face each other across a battle\r\nfront and engage in mutual slaughter, they may be considered as a single\r\narmy engaged in suicide. Now it seems to me that when countries, each\r\none severally doing its best to arrest its private economic ruin, do\r\ntheir utmost to accelerate the economic ruin of each other, we are\r\nwitnessing something very like the suicide of civilization itself. There\r\nare people in both camps who believe that armed and economic conflict\r\nbetween revolutionary and non-revolutionary Europe, or if you like\r\nbetween Capitalism and Communism, is inevitable. These people, in both\r\ncamps, are doing their best to make it inevitable. Sturdy pessimists, in\r\nMoscow no less than in London and Paris, they go so far as to say \"the\r\nsooner the better,\" and by all means in their power try to precipitate\r\na conflict. Now the main effort in Russia to-day, the struggle which\r\nabsorbs the chief attention of all but the few Communist Churchills and\r\nCommunist Millerands who, blind to all else, demand an immediate pitched\r\nbattle over the prostrate body of civilization, is directed to finding\r\na way for Russia herself out of the crisis, the severity of which can\r\nhardly be realized by people who have not visited the country again and\r\nagain, and to bringing her as quickly as possible into a state in which\r\nshe can export her raw materials and import the manufactured goods of\r\nwhich she stands in need. I believe that this struggle is ours as well\r\nas Russia's, though we to whom the threat is less imminent, are less\r\ndesperately engaged. Victory or defeat in this struggle in Russia, or\r\nanywhere else on the world's surface, is victory or defeat for every\r\none. The purpose of my book is to make that clear. For, bearing that in\r\nmind, I cannot but think that every honest man, of whatever parity,\r\nwho cares more for humanity than for politics, must do his utmost\r\nto postpone the conflict which a few extremists on each side of the\r\nbarricades so fanatically desire. If that conflict is indeed inevitable,\r\nits consequences will be less devastating to a Europe cured of her\r\nwounds than to a Europe scarcely, even by the most hopeful, to be\r\ndescribed as convalescent. But the conflict may not be inevitable after\r\nall. No man not purblind but sees that Communist Europe is changing no\r\nless than Capitalist Europe. If we succeed in postponing the struggle\r\nlong enough, we may well succeed in postponing it until the war-like on\r\nboth sides look in vain for the reasons of their bellicosity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n Introduction\r\n The Shortage of Things\r\n The Shortage of Men\r\n The Communist Dictatorship\r\n A Conference at Jaroslavl\r\n The Trade Unions\r\n The Propaganda Trains\r\n Saturdayings\r\n Industrial Conscription\r\n What the Communists Are Trying to do in Russia\r\n Rykov on Economic plans and on the Transformation of the Communist Party\r\n Non-Partyism\r\n Possibilities\r\n\r\n\r\n     ***I am indebted to the editor of the \"Manchester Guardian\"\r\n     for permission to make use in some of the chapters of this\r\n     book of material which has appeared in his paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CRISIS IN RUSSIA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SHORTAGE OF THINGS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing can be more futile than to describe conditions in Russia as a\r\nsort of divine punishment for revolution, or indeed to describe them at\r\nall without emphasizing the fact that the crisis in Russia is part of\r\nthe crisis in Europe, and has been in the main brought about like the\r\nrevolution itself, by the same forces that have caused, for example, the\r\ncrisis in Germany or the crisis in Austria.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo country in Europe is capable of complete economic independence. In\r\nspite of her huge variety of natural resources, the Russian organism\r\nseemed in 1914 to have been built up on the generous assumption that\r\nwith Europe at least the country was to be permanently at peace, or\r\nat the lost to engage in military squabbles which could be reckoned\r\nin months, and would keep up the prestige of the autocracy without\r\nseriously hampering imports and exports. Almost every country in Europe,\r\nwith the exception of England, was better fitted to stand alone, was\r\nless completely specialized in a single branch of production. England,\r\nfortunately for herself, was not isolated during the war, and will not\r\nbecome isolated unless the development of the crisis abroad deprives\r\nher of her markets. England produces practically no food, but\r\ngreat quantities of coal, steel and manufactured goods. Isolate her\r\nabsolutely, and she will not only starve, but will stop producing\r\nmanufactured goods, steel and coal, because those who usually produce\r\nthese things will be getting nothing for their labor except money which\r\nthey will be unable to use to buy dinners, because there will be no\r\ndinners to buy. That supposititious case is a precise parallel to what\r\nhas happened in Russia. Russia produced practically no manufactured\r\ngoods (70 per cent. of her machinery she received from abroad), but\r\ngreat quantities of food. The blockade isolated her. By the blockade I\r\ndo not mean merely the childish stupidity committed by ourselves, but\r\nthe blockade, steadily increasing in strictness, which began in August,\r\n1914, and has been unnecessarily prolonged by our stupidity. The war,\r\neven while for Russia it was not nominally a blockade, was so actually.\r\nThe use of tonnage was perforce restricted to the transport of the\r\nnecessaries of war, and these were narrowly defined as shells, guns and\r\nso on, things which do not tend to improve a country economically, but\r\nrather the reverse. The imports from Sweden through Finland were no sort\r\nof make-weight for the loss of Poland and Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe war meant that Russia's ordinary imports practically ceased. It\r\nmeant a strain on Russia, comparable to that which would have been put\r\non England if the German submarine campaign had succeeded in putting\r\nan end to our imports of food from the Americas. From the moment of the\r\nDeclaration of War, Russia was in the position of one \"holding out,\" of\r\na city standing a siege without a water supply, for her imports were so\r\nnecessary to her economy that they may justly be considered as essential\r\nirrigation. There could be no question for her of improvement, of\r\nstrengthening. She was faced with the fact until the war should end\r\nshe had to do with what she had, and that the things she had formerly\r\ncounted on importing would be replaced by guns and shells, to be used,\r\nas it turned out, in battering Russian property that happened to be in\r\nenemy hands. She even learned that she had to develop gun-making and\r\nshell-making at home, at the expense of those other industries which to\r\nsome small extent might have helped her to keep going. And, just as in\r\nEngland such a state of affairs would lead to a cessation of the output\r\nof iron and coal in which England is rich, so in Russia, in spite of her\r\ncorn lands, it led to a shortage of food.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Russian peasant formerly produced food, for which he was paid in\r\nmoney. With that money, formerly, he was able to clothe himself, to buy\r\nthe tools of his labor, and further, though no doubt he never observed\r\nthe fact, to pay for the engines and wagons that took his food to\r\nmarket. A huge percentage of the clothes and the tools and the engines\r\nand the wagons and the rails came from abroad, and even those factories\r\nin Russia which were capable of producing such things were, in many\r\nessentials, themselves dependent upon imports. Russian towns began to\r\nbe hungry in 1915. In October of that year the Empress reported to\r\nthe Emperor that the shrewd Rasputin had seen in a vision that it was\r\nnecessary to bring wagons with flour, butter and sugar from Siberia,\r\nand proposed that for three days nothing else should be done. Then\r\nthere would be no strikes. \"He blesses you for the arrangement of\r\nthese trains.\" In 1916 the peasants were burying their bread instead of\r\nbringing it to market. In the autumn of 1916 I remember telling certain\r\nmost incredulous members of the English Government that there would be\r\na most serious food shortage in Russia in the near future. In 1917 came\r\nthe upheaval of the revolution, in 1918 peace, but for Russia, civil\r\nwar and the continuance of the blockade. By July, 1919, the rarity of\r\nmanufactured goods was such that it was possible two hundred miles south\r\nof Moscow to obtain ten eggs for a box of matches, and the rarity of\r\ngoods requiring distant transport became such that in November, 1919, in\r\nWestern Russia, the peasants would sell me nothing for money, whereas\r\nmy neighbor in the train bought all he wanted in exchange for small\r\nquantities of salt.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was not even as if, in vital matters, Russia started the war in a\r\nsatisfactory condition. The most vital of all questions in a country\r\nof huge distances must necessarily be that of transport. It is no\r\nexaggeration to say that only by fantastic efforts was Russian transport\r\nable to save its face and cover its worst deficiencies even before the\r\nwar began. The extra strain put upon it by the transport of troops\r\nand the maintenance of the armies exposed its weakness, and with each\r\nsucceeding week of war, although in 1916 and 1917 Russia did receive\r\n775 locomotives from abroad, Russian transport went from bad to worse,\r\nmaking inevitable a creeping paralysis of Russian economic life, during\r\nthe latter already acute stages of which the revolutionaries succeeded\r\nto the disease that had crippled their precursors.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1914 Russia had in all 20,057 locomotives, of which 15,047 burnt\r\ncoal, 4,072 burnt oil and 938 wood. But that figure of twenty thousand\r\nwas more impressive for a Government official, who had his own reasons\r\nfor desiring to be impressed, than for a practical railway engineer,\r\nsince of that number over five thousand engines were more than twenty\r\nyears old, over two thousand were more than thirty years old, fifteen\r\nhundred were more than forty years old, and 147 patriarchs had passed\r\ntheir fiftieth birthday. Of the whole twenty thousand only 7,108 were\r\nunder ten years of age. That was six years ago. In the meantime Russia\r\nhas been able to make in quantities decreasing during the last five\r\nyears by 40 and 50 per cent. annually, 2,990 new locomotives. In 1914 of\r\nthe locomotives then in Russia about 17,000 were in working condition.\r\nIn 1915 there were, in spite of 800 new ones, only 16,500. In 1916 the\r\nnumber of healthy locomotives was slightly higher, owing partly to\r\nthe manufacture of 903 at home in the preceding year and partly to the\r\narrival of 400 from abroad. In 1917 in spite of the arrival of a further\r\nsmall contingent the number sank to between 15,000 and 16,000. Early\r\nin 1918 the Germans in the Ukraine and elsewhere captured 3,000.\r\nOthers were lost in the early stages of the civil war. The number of\r\nlocomotives fell from 14,519 in January to 8,457 in April, after which\r\nthe artificially instigated revolt of the Czecho-Slovaks made possible\r\nthe fostering of civil war on a large scale, and the number fell swiftly\r\nto 4,679 in December. In 1919 the numbers varied less markedly, but\r\nthe decline continued, and in December last year 4,141 engines were\r\nin working order. In January this year the number was 3,969, rising\r\nslightly in February, when the number was 4,019. A calculation was made\r\nbefore the war that in the best possible conditions the maximum Russian\r\noutput of engines could be not more than 1,800 annually. At this rate\r\nin ten years the Russians could restore their collection of engines\r\nto something like adequate numbers. Today, thirty years would be an\r\ninadequate estimate, for some factories, like the Votkinsky, have been\r\npurposely ruined by the Whites, in others the lathes and other machinery\r\nfor building and repairing locomotives are worn out, many of the skilled\r\nengineers were killed in the war with Germany, many others in defending\r\nthe revolution, and it will be long before it will be possible to\r\nrestore to the workmen or to the factories the favorable material\r\nconditions of 1912-13. Thus the main fact in the present crisis is that\r\nRussia possesses one-fifth of the number of locomotives which in\r\n1914 was just sufficient to maintain her railway system in a state of\r\nefficiency which to English observers at that time was a joke. For six\r\nyears she has been unable to import the necessary machinery for making\r\nengines or repairing them. Further, coal and oil have been, until\r\nrecently, cut off by the civil war. The coal mines are left, after\r\nthe civil war, in such a condition that no considerable output may be\r\nexpected from them in the near future. Thus, even those engines which\r\nexist have had their efficiency lessened by being adapted in a rough and\r\nready manner for burning wood fuel instead of that for which they were\r\ndesigned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us now examine the combined effect of ruined transport and the six\r\nyears' blockade on Russian life in town and country. First of all was\r\ncut off the import of manufactured goods from abroad. That has had\r\na cumulative effect completed, as it were, and rounded off by the\r\nbreakdown of transport. By making it impossible to bring food, fuel\r\nand raw material to the factories, the wreck of transport makes it\r\nimpossible for Russian industry to produce even that modicum which\r\nit contributed to the general supply of manufactured goods which the\r\nRussian peasant was accustomed to receive in exchange for his production\r\nof food. On the whole the peasant himself eats rather more than he did\r\nbefore the war. But he has no matches, no salt, no clothes, no boots, no\r\ntools. The Communists are trying to put an end to illiteracy in Russia,\r\nand in the villages the most frequent excuse for keeping children from\r\nschool is a request to come and see them, when they will be found, as I\r\nhave seen them myself, playing naked about the stove, without boots\r\nor anything but a shirt, if that, in which to go and learn to read and\r\nwrite. Clothes and such things as matches are, however, of less vital\r\nimportance than tools, the lack of which is steadily reducing Russia's\r\nactual power of food production. Before the war Russia needed from\r\nabroad huge quantities of agricultural implements, not only machines,\r\nbut simple things like axes, sickles, scythes. In 1915 her own\r\nproduction of these things had fallen to 15.1 per cent. of her already\r\ninadequate peacetime output. In 1917 it had fallen to 2.1 per cent. The\r\nSoviet Government is making efforts to raise it, and is planning\r\nnew factories exclusively for the making of these things. But, with\r\ntransport in such a condition, a new factory means merely a new demand\r\nfor material and fuel which there are neither engines nor wagons to\r\nbring. Meanwhile, all over Russia, spades are worn out, men are plowing\r\nwith burnt staves instead of with plowshares, scratching the surface of\r\nthe ground, and instead of harrowing with a steel-spiked harrow of\r\nsome weight, are brushing the ground with light constructions of wooden\r\nspikes bound together with wattles.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe actual agricultural productive powers of Russia are consequently\r\nsinking. But things are no better if we turn from the rye and corn lands\r\nto the forests. Saws are worn out. Axes are worn out. Even apart from\r\nthat, the shortage of transport affects the production of wood fuel,\r\nlack of which reacts on transport and on the factories and so on in a\r\ncircle from which nothing but a large import of engines and wagons will\r\nprovide an outlet. Timber can be floated down the rivers. Yes, but it\r\nmust be brought to the rivers. Surely horses can do that. Yes, but,\r\nhorses must be fed, and oats do not grow in the forests. For example,\r\nthis spring (1920) the best organized timber production was in Perm\r\nGovernment. There sixteen thousand horses have been mobilized for\r\nthe work, but further development is impossible for lack of forage. A\r\ntelegram bitterly reports, \"Two trains of oats from Ekaterinburg are\r\nexpected day by day. If the oats arrive in time a considerable success\r\nwill be possible.\" And if the oats do not arrive in time? Besides, not\r\nhorses alone require to be fed. The men who cut the wood cannot do it\r\non empty stomachs. And again rises a cry for trains, that do not arrive,\r\nfor food that exists somewhere, but not in the forest where men work.\r\nThe general effect of the wreck of transport on food is stated as\r\nfollows: Less than 12 per cent. of the oats required, less than 5 per\r\ncent. of the bread and salt required for really efficient working, were\r\nbrought to the forests. Nonetheless three times as much wood has been\r\nprepared as the available transport has removed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe towns suffer from lack of transport, and from the combined effect\r\non the country of their productive weakness and of the loss of their old\r\nposition as centres through which the country received its imports from\r\nabroad. Townsfolk and factory workers lack food, fuel, raw materials and\r\nmuch else that in a civilized State is considered a necessary of life.\r\nThus, ten million poods of fish were caught last year, but there were\r\nno means of bringing them from the fisheries to the great industrial\r\ncentres where they were most needed. Townsfolk are starving, and in\r\nwinter, cold. People living in rooms in a flat, complete strangers to\r\neach other, by general agreement bring all their beds into the kitchen.\r\nIn the kitchen soup is made once a day. There is a little warmth there\r\nbeside the natural warmth of several human beings in a small room. There\r\nit is possible to sleep. During the whole of last winter, in the case I\r\nhave in mind, there were no means of heating the other rooms, where the\r\ntemperature was almost always far below freezing point. It is difficult\r\nto make the conditions real except by individual examples. The lack of\r\nmedicines, due directly to the blockade, seems to have small effect on\r\nthe imagination when simply stated as such. Perhaps people will\r\nrealize what it means when instead of talking of the wounded undergoing\r\noperations without anesthetics I record the case of an acquaintance, a\r\nBolshevik, working in a Government office, who suffered last summer\r\nfrom a slight derangement of the stomach due to improper and inadequate\r\nfeeding. His doctor prescribed a medicine, and nearly a dozen different\r\napothecaries were unable to make up the prescription for lack of one or\r\nseveral of the simple ingredients required. Soap has become an article\r\nso rare (in Russia as in Germany during the blockade and the war there\r\nis a terrible absence of fats) that for the present it is to be treated\r\nas a means of safeguarding labor, to be given to the workmen for washing\r\nafter and during their work, and in preference to miners, chemical,\r\nmedical and sanitary workers, for whose efficiency and health it is\r\nessential. The proper washing of underclothes is impossible. To induce\r\nthe population of Moscow to go to the baths during the typhus epidemic,\r\nit was sufficient bribe to promise to each person beside the free bath\r\na free scrap of soap. Houses are falling into disrepair for want of\r\nplaster, paint and tools. Nor is it possible to substitute one thing for\r\nanother, for Russia's industries all suffer alike from their dependence\r\non the West, as well as from the inadequacy of the transport to bring to\r\nfactories the material they need. People remind each other that during\r\nthe war the Germans, when similarly hard put to it for clothes,\r\nmade paper dresses, table-cloths, etc. In Russia the nets used in\r\npaper-making are worn out. At last, in April, 1920 (so Lenin told me),\r\nthere seemed to be a hope of getting new ones from abroad. But the\r\ncondition of the paper industry is typical of all, in a country which,\r\nit should not be forgotten, could be in a position to supply wood-pulp\r\nfor other countries besides itself. The factories are able to produce\r\nonly sixty per cent. of demands that have previously, by the strictest\r\nscrutiny, been reduced to a minimum before they are made. The reasons,\r\napart from the lack of nets and cloths, are summed up in absence of\r\nfood, forage and finally labor. Even when wood is brought by river the\r\ntrouble is not yet overcome. The horses are dead and eaten or starved\r\nand weak. Factories have to cease working so that the workmen,\r\nthemselves underfed, can drag the wood from the barges to the mills.\r\nIt may well be imagined what the effect of hunger, cold, and the\r\ndisheartenment consequent on such conditions of work and the seeming\r\nhopelessness of the position have on the productivity of labor, the\r\nfall in which reacts on all the industries, on transport, on the general\r\nsituation and so again on itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. J. M. Keynes, writing with Central Europe in his mind (he is, I\r\nthink, as ignorant of Russia as I am of Germany), says: \"What then is\r\nour picture of Europe? A country population able to support life on the\r\nfruits of its own agricultural production, but without the accustomed\r\nsurplus for the towns, and also (as a result of the lack of imported\r\nmaterials, and so of variety and amount in the salable manufactures of\r\nthe towns) without the usual incentives to market food in exchange for\r\nother wares; an industrial population unable to keep its strength for\r\nlack of food, unable to earn a livelihood for lack of materials, and so\r\nunable to make good by imports from abroad the failure of productivity\r\nat home.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRussia is an emphasized engraving, in which every line of that picture\r\nis bitten in with repeated washes of acid. Several new lines, however,\r\nare added to the drawing, for in Russia the processes at work elsewhere\r\nhave gone further than in the rest of Europe, and it is possible to see\r\ndimly, in faint outline, the new stage of decay which is threatened.\r\nThe struggle to arrest decay is the real crisis of the revolution, of\r\nRussia, and, not impossibly, of Europe. For each country that develops\r\nto the end in this direction is a country lost to the economic comity of\r\nEurope. And, as one country follows another over the brink, so will\r\nthe remaining countries be faced by conditions of increasingly narrow\r\nself-dependence, in fact by the very conditions which in Russia, so far,\r\nhave received their clearest, most forcible illustration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SHORTAGE OF MEN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chapter I wrote of Russia's many wants, and of the\r\nprocesses visibly at work, tending to make her condition worse and not\r\nbetter. But I wrote of things, not of people. I wrote of the shortage of\r\nthis and of that, but not of the most serious of all shortages, which,\r\nwhile itself largely due to those already discussed, daily intensifies\r\nthem, and points the way to that further stage of decay which is\r\nthreatened in the near future in Russia, and, in the more distant future\r\nin Europe. I did not write of the shortage deterioration of labor.\r\n\r\n\r\nShortage of labor is not peculiar to Russia. It is among the postwar\r\nphenomena common to all countries. The war and its accompanying eases\r\nhave cost Europe, including Russia, an enormous number of able-bodied\r\nmen. Many millions of others have lost the habit of regular work. German\r\nindustrialists complain that they cannot get labor, and that when they\r\nget it, it is not productive. I heard complaints on the same subject in\r\nEngland. But just as the economic crisis, due in the first instance to\r\nthe war and the isolation it imposed, has gone further in Russia than\r\nelsewhere, so the shortage of labor, at present a handicap, an annoyance\r\nin more fortunate countries, is in Russia perhaps the greatest of the\r\nnational dangers. Shortage of labor cannot be measured simply by the\r\ndecreasing numbers of the workmen. If it takes two workmen as long to do\r\na particular job in 1920 as it took one man to do it in 1914, then, even\r\nif the number of workman has remained the same, the actual supply of\r\nlabor has been halved. And in Russia the situation is worse than that.\r\nFor example, in the group of State metal-working factories, those, in\r\nfact which may be considered as the weapon with which Russia is trying\r\nto cut her way out of her transport difficulties, apart from the fact\r\nthat there were in 1916 81,600 workmen, whereas in 1920 there are only\r\n42,500, labor has deteriorated in the most appalling manner. In 1916 in\r\nthese factories 92 per cent. of the nominal working hours were actually\r\nkept; in 1920 work goes on during only 60 per cent. of the nominal\r\nhours. It is estimated that the labor of a single workman produces now\r\nonly one quarter of what it produced in 1916. To take another example,\r\nalso from workmen engaged in transport, that is to say, in the most\r\nimportant of all work at the present time: in the Moscow junction of the\r\nMoscow Kazan Railway, between November 1st and February 29th (1920),\r\n292 workmen and clerks missed 12,048 working days, being absent, on\r\nin average, forty days per man in the four months. In Moscow\r\npassenger-station on this line, 22 workmen missed in November 106 days,\r\nin December 273, in January 338, and in February 380; in an appalling\r\ncrescendo further illustrated by the wagon department, where 28 workmen\r\nmissed in November 104 days and in February 500. In November workmen\r\nabsented themselves for single days. In February the same workmen were\r\nabsent for the greater part of the month. The invariable excuse was\r\nillness. Many cases of illness there undoubtedly were, since this period\r\nwas the worst of the typhus epidemic, but besides illness, and besides\r\nmere obvious idleness which no doubt accounts for a certain proportion\r\nof illegitimate holidays, there is another explanation which goes nearer\r\nthe root of the matter. Much of the time filched from the State was in\r\nall probability spent in expeditions in search of food. In Petrograd,\r\nthe Council of Public Economy complain that there is a tendency to turn\r\nthe eight-hour day into a four-hour day. Attempts are being made to\r\narrest this tendency by making an additional food allowance conditional\r\non the actual fulfilment of working days. In the Donetz coal basin, the\r\nmonthly output per man was in 1914 750 poods, in 1916 615 poods, in 1919\r\n240 poods (figures taken from Ekaterinoslav Government), and in 1920\r\nthe output per man is estimated at being something near 220 poods. In the\r\nshale mines on the Volga, where food conditions are comparatively good,\r\nproductivity is comparatively high. Thus in a small mine near Simbirsk\r\nthere are 230 workmen, of' whom 50 to 60 are skilled. The output for the\r\nunskilled is 28.9 poods in a shift, for the skilled 68.3. But even there\r\n25 per cent. of the workmen are regular absentees, and actually the mine\r\nworks only 17 or 18 days in a month, that is, 70 per cent. of the normal\r\nnumber of working days. The remaining 30 per cent. of normal working\r\ntime is spent by the workmen in getting food. Another small mine in the\r\nsame district is worked entirely by unskilled labor, the workers being\r\npeasants from the neighboring villages. In this mine the productivity\r\nper man is less, but all the men work full time. They do not have to\r\nwaste time in securing food, because, being local peasants, they are\r\nsupplied by their own villages and families. In Moscow and Petrograd\r\nfood is far more difficult to secure, more time is wasted on that\r\nhopeless task; even with that waste of time, the workman is not properly\r\nfed, and it cannot be wondered at that his productivity is low.\r\n\r\n\r\nSomething, no doubt, is due to the natural character of the Russians,\r\nwhich led Trotsky to define man as an animal distinguished by laziness.\r\nRussians are certainly lazy, and probably owe to their climate their\r\nremarkable incapacity for prolonged effort. The Russian climate is such\r\nthat over large areas of Russia the Russian peasant is accustomed, and\r\nhas been accustomed for hundreds of years, to perform prodigies of\r\nlabor during two short periods of sowing and harvest, and to spend the\r\nimmensely long and monotonous winter in a hibernation like that of the\r\nsnake or the dormouse. There is a much greater difference between a\r\nRussian workman's normal output and that of which he is capable for a\r\nshort time if he sets himself to it, than there is between the normal\r\nand exceptional output of an Englishman, whose temperate climate has\r\nnot taught him to regard a great part of the year as a period of mere\r\nwaiting for and resting from the extraordinary effort of a few weeks.\r\n[*]\r\n\r\n     * Given any particular motive, any particular enthusiasm, or\r\n     visible, desirable object, even the hungry Russian workmen\r\n     of to-day are capable of sudden and temporary increase of\r\n     output. The \"Saturdayings\" (see p. 119) provide endless\r\n     illustrations of this.  They had something in the character\r\n     of a picnic, they were novel, they were out of the routine,\r\n     and the productivity of labor during a \"Saturdaying\" was\r\n     invariably higher than on a weekday.  For example, there is\r\n     a shortage of paper for cigarettes.  People roll cigarettes\r\n     in old newspapers.  It occurred to the Central Committee of\r\n     the Papermakers' Union to organize a \"Sundaying\" with the\r\n     object of sending cigarette paper to the soldiers in the Red\r\n     Army. Six factories took part.  Here is a table showing the\r\n     output of these factories during the \"Sundaying\" and the\r\n     average weekday output.  The figures are in poods.\r\n\r\n                                Made on      Average week\r\n     Factory               the Sunday     Day Output\r\n\r\n     Krasnogorodskaya.........615...............450\r\n     Griaznovskaya.............65................45\r\n     Medianskaya..............105................90\r\n     Dobruzhskaya.............186...............250\r\n     Belgiiskaya..............127................85\r\n     Ropshinskaya..............85................55]\r\n\r\n\r\nBut this uneven working temperament was characteristic of the Russian\r\nbefore the war as well as now. It has been said that the revolution\r\nremoved the stimulus to labor, and left the Russian laziness to have its\r\nway. In the first period of the revolution that may have been true.\r\nIt is becoming day by day less true. The fundamental reasons of low\r\nproductivity will not be found in any sudden or unusual efflorescence\r\nof idleness, but in economic conditions which cannot but reduce the\r\nproductivity of idle and industrious alike. Insufficient feeding is\r\none such reason. The proportion of working time consumed in foraging\r\nis another. But the whole of my first chapter may be taken as a compact\r\nmass of reasons why the Russians at the present time should not work\r\nwith anything like a normal productivity. It is said that bad workmen\r\ncomplain of their tools, but even good ones become disheartened if\r\ncompelled to work with makeshifts, mended tools, on a stock of materials\r\nthat runs out from one day to the next, in factories where the machinery\r\nmay come at any moment to a standstill from lack of fuel. There would\r\nthus be a shortage of labor in Russia, even if the numbers of workmen\r\nwere the same today as they were before the war. Unfortunately that is\r\nnot so. Turning from the question of low productivity per man to that\r\nof absolute shortage of men: the example given at the beginning of\r\nthis chapter, showing that in the most important group of factories the\r\nnumber of workmen has fallen 50 per cent. is by no means exceptional.\r\nWalking through the passages of what used to be the Club of the Nobles,\r\nand is now the house of the Trades Unions during the recent Trades Union\r\nCongress in Moscow, I observed among a number of pictorial diagrams\r\non the walls, one in particular illustrating the rise and fall of the\r\nworking population of Moscow during a number of years. Each year was\r\nrepresented by the picture of a factory with a chimney which rose and\r\nfell with the population. From that diagram I took the figures for 1913,\r\n1918 and 1919. These figures should be constantly borne in mind by any\r\none who wishes to realize how catastrophic the shortage of labor in\r\nRussia actually is, and to judge how sweeping may be the changes in the\r\nsocial configuration of the country if that shortage continues to\r\nincrease. Here are the figures:\r\n\r\n\r\n     Workmen in Moscow in 1913............159,344\r\n     Workmen in Moscow in 1918...........157,282\r\n     Workmen in Moscow in 1919............105,210\r\n\r\n\r\nThat is to say, that one-third of the workmen of Moscow ceased to\r\nlive there, or ceased to be workmen, in the course of a single year.\r\nA similar phenomenon is observable in each one of the big industrial\r\ndistricts.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat has become of those workmen?\r\n\r\n\r\nA partial explanation is obvious. The main impulse of the revolution\r\ncame from the town workers. Of these, the metal workers were the most\r\ndecided, and those who most freely joined the Red Guard in the early and\r\nthe Red Army in the later days of the revolution. Many, in those early\r\ndays, when there was more enthusiasm than discipline, when there were\r\nhardly any experienced officers, and those without much authority, were\r\nslaughtered during the German advance of 1918. The first mobilizations,\r\nwhen conscription was introduced, were among the workers in the great\r\nindustrial districts. The troops from Petrograd and Moscow, exclusively\r\nworkmen's regiments, have suffered more than any other during the civil\r\nwar, being the most dependable and being thrown, like the guards of old\r\ntime, into the worst place at any serious crisis. Many thousands of them\r\nhave died for the sake of the revolution which, were they living,\r\nthey would be hard put to it to save. (The special shortage of skilled\r\nworkers is also partially to be explained by the indiscriminate\r\nmobilizations of 1914-15, when great numbers of the most valuable\r\nengineers and other skilled workers were thrown into the front line, and\r\nit was not until their loss was already felt that the Tsar's Government\r\nin this matter came belatedly to its senses.)\r\n\r\n\r\nBut these explanations are only partial. The more general answer to\r\nthe question, What has become of the workmen? lies in the very economic\r\ncrisis which their absence accentuates. Russia is unlike England, where\r\nstarvation of the towns would be practically starvation of the whole\r\nisland. In Russia, if a man is hungry, he has only to walk far enough\r\nand he will come to a place where there is plenty to eat. Almost every\r\nRussian worker retains in some form or other connection with a village,\r\nwhere, if he returns, he will not be an entire stranger, but at worst a\r\npoor relation, and quite possibly an honored guest. It is not surprising\r\nthat many thousands have \"returned to the land\" in this way.\r\n\r\nFurther, if a workman retains his connection, both with a distant\r\nvillage and with a town, he can keep himself and his family fat and\r\nprosperous by ceasing to be a workman, and, instead, traveling on the\r\nbuffers or the roof of a railway wagon, and bringing back with him sacks\r\nof flour and potatoes for sale in the town at fantastic prices. Thereby\r\nhe is lost to productive labor, and his uncomfortable but adventurous\r\nlife becomes directly harmful, tending to increase the strain on\r\ntransport, since it is obviously more economical to transport a thousand\r\nsacks than to transport a thousand sacks with an idle workman attached\r\nto each sack. Further, his activities actually make it more difficult\r\nfor the town population to get food. By keeping open for the village the\r\npossibility of selling at fantastic prices, he lessens the readiness\r\nof the peasants to part with their flour at the lower prices of the\r\nGovernment. Nor is it as if his activities benefited the working\r\npopulation. The food he brings in goes for the most part to those who\r\nhave plenty of money or have things to exchange for it. And honest\r\nmen in Russia to-day have not much money, and those who have things to\r\nexchange are not as a rule workmen. The theory of this man's harmfulness\r\nis, I know, open to argument, but the practice at least is exactly as\r\nI have stated it, and is obviously attractive to the individual who\r\nprefers adventure on a full stomach to useful work on an empty. Setting\r\naside the theory with its latent quarrel between Free Trade and State\r\ncontrol, we can still recognize that each workman engaged in these\r\npursuits has become an unproductive middleman, one of that very\r\nparasitic species which the revolutionaries had hoped to make\r\nunnecessary. It is bad from the revolutionary point of view if a workman\r\nis so employed, but it is no less bad from the point of view of people\r\nwho do not care twopence about the revolution one way or the other, but\r\ndo care about getting Russia on her feet again and out of her economic\r\ncrisis. It is bad enough if an unskilled workman is so employed. It is\r\nfar worse if a skilled workman finds he can do better for himself as\r\na \"food speculator\" than by the exercise of his legitimate craft. From\r\nmines, from every kind of factory come complaints of the decreasing\r\nproportion of skilled to unskilled workmen. The superior intelligence\r\nof the skilled worker offers him definite advantages should he engage in\r\nthese pursuits, and his actual skill gives him other advantages in the\r\nvillages. He can leave his factory and go to the village, there on\r\nthe spot to ply his trade or variations of it, when as a handy man,\r\nrepairing tools, etc., he will make an easy living and by lessening\r\nthe dependence of the village on the town do as much as the \"food\r\nspeculator\" in worsening the conditions of the workman he has left\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd with that we come to the general changes in the social geography\r\nof Russia which are threatened if the processes now at work continue\r\nunchecked. The relations between town and village are the fundamental\r\nproblem of the revolution. Town and countryside are in sharp\r\ncontradiction daily intensified by the inability of the towns to supply\r\nthe country's needs. The town may be considered as a single productive\r\norganism, with feelers stretching into the country, and actual outposts\r\nthere in the form of agricultural enterprises taking their directives\r\nfrom the centre and working as definite parts of the State organism.\r\nAll round this town organism, in all its interstices, it too, with its\r\nfeelers in the form of \"food speculators,\" is the anarchic chaos of the\r\ncountry, consisting of a myriad independent units, regulated by no plan,\r\nwithout a brain centre of any kind. Either the organized town will\r\nhold its own against and gradually dominate and systematize the country\r\nchaos, or that chaos little by little will engulf the town organism.\r\nEvery workman who leaves the town automatically places himself on the\r\nside of the country in that struggle. And when a town like Moscow loses\r\na third of its working population in a year, it is impossible not to\r\nsee that, so far, the struggle is going in favor of that huge chaotic,\r\nunconscious but immensely powerful countryside. There is even a danger\r\nthat the town may become divided against itself. Just as scarcity of\r\nfood leads to food speculation, so the shortage of labor is making\r\npossible a sort of speculation in labor. The urgent need of labor has\r\nled to a resurrection of the methods of the direct recruiting of\r\nworkmen in the villages by the agents of particular factories, who by\r\nexceptional terms succeed in getting workmen where the Government organs\r\nfail. And, of course, this recruiting is not confined to the villages.\r\nThose enterprises which are situated in the corn districts are naturally\r\nable to offer better conditions, for the sake of which workmen are ready\r\nto leave their jobs and skilled workmen to do unskilled work, and the\r\nresult can only be a drainage of good workmen away from the hungry\r\ncentral industrial districts where they are most of all needed.\r\n\r\n\r\nSumming up the facts collected in this chapter and in the first on\r\nthe lack of things and the lack of men, I think the economic crisis in\r\nRussia may be fairly stated as follows: Owing to the appalling condition\r\nof Russian transport, and owing to the fact that since 1914 Russia has\r\nbeen practically in a state of blockade, the towns have lost their power\r\nof supplying, either as middlemen or as producers, the simplest needs\r\nof the villages. Partly owing to this, partly again because of the\r\ncondition of transport, the towns are not receiving the necessaries of\r\nlife in sufficient quantities. The result of this is a serious fall in\r\nthe productivity of labor, and a steady flow of skilled and unskilled\r\nworkmen from the towns towards the villages, and from employments the\r\nexercise of which tends to assist the towns in recovering their old\r\nposition as essential sources of supply to employments that tend to\r\nhave the opposite effect. If this continues unchecked, it will make\r\nimpossible the regeneration of Russian industry, and will result in\r\nthe increasing independence of the villages, which will tend to become\r\nentirely self-supporting communities, tilling the ground in a less and\r\nless efficient manner, with ruder tools, with less and less incentive to\r\nproduce more than is wanted for the needs of the village itself. Russia,\r\nin these circumstances, may sink into something very like barbarism, for\r\nwith the decay of the economic importance of the towns would decay\r\nalso their authority, and free-booting on a small and large scale would\r\nbecome profitable and not very dangerous. It would be possible, no\r\ndoubt, for foreigners to trade with the Russians as with the natives of\r\nthe cannibal islands, bartering looking-glasses and cheap tools, but,\r\nshould such a state of things come to be, it would mean long years of\r\ncolonization, with all the new possibilities and risks involved in the\r\nsubjugation of a free people, before Western Europe could count once\r\nmore on getting a considerable portion of its food from Russian corn\r\nlands.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat is the position, those the natural tendencies at work. But opposed\r\nto these tendencies are the united efforts of the Communists and of\r\nthose who, leaving the question of Communism discreetly aside, work with\r\nthem for the sake of preventing such collapse of Russian civilization.\r\nThey recognize the existence of every one of the tendencies I have\r\ndescribed, but they are convinced that every one of these tendencies\r\nwill be arrested. They believe that the country will not conquer the\r\ntown but the reverse. So far from expecting the unproductive stagnation\r\ndescribed in the last paragraph, they think of Russia as of the natural\r\nfood supply of Europe, which the Communists among them believe will, in\r\ncourse of time, be made up for \"Working Men's Republics\" (though, for\r\nthe sake of their own Republic, they are not inclined to postpone trade\r\nwith Europe until that epoch arrives). At the very time when spades and\r\nsickles are wearing out or worn out, these men are determined that\r\nthe food output of Russia shall sooner or later be increased by the\r\nintroduction of better methods of agriculture and farming on a larger\r\nscale. We are witnessing in Russia the first stages of a titanic\r\nstruggle, with on one side all the forces of nature leading apparently\r\nto an inevitable collapse of civilization, and on the other side nothing\r\nbut the incalculable force of human will.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMMUNIST DICTATORSHIP\r\n\r\n\r\nHow is that will expressed? What is the organization welded by adversity\r\nwhich, in this crisis, supersedes even the Soviet Constitution, and\r\nstands between this people and chaos?\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a commonplace to say that Russia is ruled, driven if you like,\r\ncold, starving as she is, to effort after effort by the dictatorship of\r\na party. It is a commonplace alike in the mouths of those who wish to\r\nmake the continued existence of that organization impossible and in the\r\nmouths of the Communists themselves. At the second congress of the Third\r\nInternational, Trotsky remarked. \"A party as such, in the course of the\r\ndevelopment of a revolution, becomes identical with the revolution.\"\r\nLenin, on the same occasion, replying to a critic who said that he\r\ndiffered from, the Communists in his understanding of what was meant by\r\nthe Dictatorship of the Proletariat, said, \"He says that we understand\r\nby the words 'Dictatorship of the Proletariat' what is actually the\r\ndictatorship of its determined and conscious minority. And that is the\r\nfact.\" Later he asked, \"What is this minority? It may be called a party.\r\nIf this minority is actually conscious, if it is able to draw the masses\r\nafter it, if it shows itself capable of replying to every question on\r\nthe agenda list of the political day, it actually constitutes a party.\"\r\nAnd Trotsky again, on the same occasion, illustrated the relative\r\npositions of the Soviet Constitution and the Communist Party when he\r\nsaid, \"And today, now that we have received an offer of peace from the\r\nPolish Government, who decides the question? Whither are the workers to\r\nturn? We have our Council of People's Commissaries, of course, but that,\r\ntoo, must be under a certain control. Whose control? The control of the\r\nworking class as a formless chaotic mass? No. The Central Committee of\r\nthe party is called together to discuss and decide the question. And\r\nwhen we have to wage war, to form new divisions, to find the best\r\nelements for them-to whom do we turn? To the party, to the Central\r\nCommittee. And it gives directives to the local committees, 'Send\r\nCommunists to the front.' The case is precisely the same with the\r\nAgrarian question, with that of supply, and with all other questions\r\nwhatsoever.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNo one denies these facts, but their mere statement is quite inadequate\r\nto explain what is being done in Russia and how it is being done. I\r\ndo not think it would be a waste of time to set down as briefly\r\nas possible, without the comments of praise or blame that would be\r\ninevitable from one primarily interested in the problem from the\r\nCapitalist or Communist point of view what, from observation and\r\ninquiry, I believe to be the main framework of the organization whereby\r\nthat dictatorship of the party works.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Soviet Constitution is not so much moribund as in abeyance. The\r\nExecutive Committee, for example, which used to meet once a week or even\r\noftener, now meets on the rarest occasions. Criticism on this account\r\nwas met with the reply that the members of the Executive Committee, for\r\nexample, which used to meet once a week or even oftener, now meets on\r\nthe rarest occasions. Criticism on this account was met with the reply\r\nthat the members of the Executive Committee were busy on the front and\r\nin various parts of Russia. As a matter of fact, the work which that\r\nCommittee used to do is now done by Central Committee of the Bolshevik\r\nParty, so that the bulk of the 150 members of the Central Executive are\r\nactually free for other work, a saving of something like 130 men. This\r\ndoes not involve any very great change, but merely an economy in the use\r\nof men. In the old days, as I well remember, the opening of a session of\r\nthe Executive Committee was invariably late, the reason being that the\r\nvarious parties composing it had not yet finished their preliminary and\r\nprivate discussions. There is now an overwhelming Communist majority\r\nin the Executive Committee, as elsewhere. I think it may be regarded\r\nas proved that these majorities are not always legitimately obtained.\r\nNon-Communist delegates do undoubtedly find every kind of difficulty put\r\nin their way by the rather Jesuitical adherents of the faith. But, no\r\nmatter how these majorities are obtained, the result is that when the\r\nCommunist Party has made up its mind on any subject, it is so certain\r\nof being able to carry its point that the calling together of the\r\nAll-Russian Executive Committee is merely a theatrical demonstration of\r\nthe fact that it can do what it likes. When it does meet, the Communists\r\nallow the microscopical opposition great liberty of speech, listen\r\nquietly, cheer ironically, and vote like one man, proving on every\r\noccasion that the meeting of the Executive Committee was the idlest\r\nof forms, intended rather to satisfy purists than for purposes of\r\ndiscussion, since the real discussion has all taken place beforehand\r\namong the Communists themselves. Something like this must happen with\r\nevery representative assembly at which a single party has a great\r\npreponderance and a rigid internal discipline. The real interest is in\r\nthe discussion inside the Party Committees.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis state of affairs would probably be more actively resented if the\r\npeople were capable of resenting anything but their own hunger, or of\r\nfearing anything but a general collapse which would turn that hunger\r\ninto starvation. It must be remembered that the urgency of the\r\neconomic crisis has driven political questions into the background. The\r\nCommunists (compare Rykov's remarks on this subject, p. 175) believe\r\nthat this is the natural result of social revolution. They think that\r\npolitical parties will disappear altogether and that people will band\r\ntogether, not for the victory of one of several contending political\r\nparties, but solely for economic cooperation or joint enterprise in\r\nart or science. In support of this they point to the number of their\r\nopponents who have become Communists, and to the still greater number\r\nof non-Communists who are loyally working with them for the economic\r\nreconstruction of the country. I do not agree with the Communists in\r\nthis, nor yet with their opponents, who attribute the death of political\r\ndiscussion to fear of the Extraordinary Commission. I think that both\r\nthe Communists and their opponents underestimate the influence of the\r\neconomic ruin that affects everybody. The latter particularly, feeling\r\nthat in some way they must justify themselves to politically minded\r\nforeign visitors, seek an excuse for their apathy in the one institution\r\nthat is almost universally unpopular. I have many non-Communist friends\r\nin Russia, but have never detected the least restraint that could be\r\nattributed to fear of anybody in their criticisms of the Communist\r\nregime. The fear existed alike among Communists and non-Communists,\r\nbut it was like the fear of people walking about in a particularly bad\r\nthunderstorm. The activities and arrests of the Extraordinary Commission\r\nare so haphazard, often so utterly illogical, that it is quite idle for\r\nany one to say to himself that by following any given line of conduct\r\nhe will avoid molestation. Also, there is something in the Russian\r\ncharacter which makes any prohibition of discussion almost an invitation\r\nto discuss. I have never met a Russian who could be prevented from\r\nsaying whatever he liked whenever he liked, by any threats or dangers\r\nwhatsoever. The only way to prevent a Russian from talking is to cut out\r\nhis tongue. The real reason for the apathy is that, for the moment, for\r\nalmost everybody political questions are of infinitesimal importance in\r\ncomparison with questions of food and warmth. The ferment of political\r\ndiscussion that filled the first years of the revolution has died away,\r\nand people talk about little but what they are able to get for dinner,\r\nor what somebody else his been able to get. I, like other foreign\r\nvisitors coming to Russia after feeding up in other countries, am all\r\nagog to make people talk. But the sort of questions which interest me,\r\nwith my full-fed stomach, are brushed aside almost fretfully by men who\r\nhave been more or less hungry for two or three years on end.\r\n\r\n\r\nI find, instead of an urgent desire to alter this or that at once,\r\nto-morrow, in the political complexion of the country, a general desire\r\nto do the best that can be done with things as they are, a general fear\r\nof further upheaval of any kind, in fact a general acquiescence in\r\nthe present state of affairs politically, in the hope of altering the\r\npresent state of affairs economically. And this is entirely natural.\r\nEverybody, Communists included, rails bitterly at the inefficiencies of\r\nthe present system, but everybody, Anti-Communists included, admits that\r\nthere is nothing whatever capable of taking its place. Its failure is\r\nhighly undesirable, not because it itself is good, but because such\r\nfailure would be preceded or followed by a breakdown of all existing\r\norganizations. Food distribution, inadequate as it now is, would come to\r\nan end. The innumerable non-political committees, which are rather like\r\nBoards of Directors controlling the Timber, Fur, Fishery, Steel, Matches\r\nor other Trusts (since the nationalized industries can be so considered)\r\nwould collapse, and with them would collapse not only yet one more hope\r\nof keeping a breath of life in Russian industry, but also the\r\nactual livelihoods of a great number of people, both Communists and\r\nnon-Communists. I do not think it is realized out-side Russia how large\r\na proportion of the educated classes have become civil servants of one\r\nkind or another. It is a rare thing when a whole family has left\r\nRussia, and many of the most embittered partisans of war on Russia have\r\nrelations inside Russia who have long ago found places under the new\r\nsystem, and consequently fear its collapse as much as any one. One case\r\noccurs to me in which a father was an important minister in one of the\r\nvarious White Governments which have received Allied support, while his\r\nson inside Russia was doing pretty well as a responsible official under\r\nthe Communists. Now in the event of a violent change, the Communists\r\nwould be outlaws with a price on every head, and those who have worked\r\nwith them, being Russians, know their fellow countrymen well enough to\r\nbe pretty well convinced that the mere fact that they are without cards\r\nof the membership of the Communist Party, would not save them in the\r\norgy of slaughter that would follow any such collapse.\r\n\r\n\r\nPeople may think that I underestimate the importance of, the\r\nExtraordinary Commission. I am perfectly aware that without this police\r\nforce with its spies, its prisons and its troops, the difficulties of\r\nthe Dictatorship would be increased by every kind of disorder, and the\r\nchaos, which I fear may come, would have begun long ago. I believe, too,\r\nthat the overgrown power of the Extraordinary Commission, and the\r\ncure that must sooner or later be applied to it, may, as in the French\r\nRevolution, bring about the collapse of the whole system. The Commission\r\ndepends for its strength on the fear of something else. I have seen it\r\nweaken when there was a hope of general peace. I have seen it tighten\r\nits grip in the presence of attacks from without and attempted\r\nassassination within. It is dreaded by everybody; not even Communists\r\nare safe from it; but it does not suffice to explain the Dictatorship,\r\nand is actually entirely irrelevant to the most important process of\r\nthat Dictatorship, namely, the adoption of a single idea, a single\r\nargument, by the whole of a very large body of men. The whole power of\r\nthe Extraordinary Commission does not affect in the slightest degree\r\ndiscussions inside the Communist Party, and those discussions are the\r\nsimple fact distinguishing the Communist Dictatorship from any of the\r\nother dictatorships by which it may be supplanted.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are 600,000 members of the Communist Party (611,978 on April\r\n2, 1920). There are nineteen members of the Central Committee of that\r\nparty. There are, I believe, five who, when they agree, can usually sway\r\nthe remaining fourteen. There is no need to wonder how these fourteen\r\ncan be argued into acceptance of the views of the still smaller inner\r\nring, but the process of persuading the six hundred thousand of the\r\ndesirability of, for example, such measures as those involved in\r\nindustrial conscription which, at first sight, was certainly repugnant\r\nto most of them, is the main secret of the Dictatorship, and is not in\r\nany way affected by the existence of the Extraordinary Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus the actual government of Russia at the present time may be not\r\nunfairly considered as a small group inside the Central Committee of the\r\nCommunist Party. This small group is able to persuade the majority of\r\nthe remaining members of that Committee. The Committee then sets about\r\npersuading the majority of the party. In the case of important measures\r\nthe process is elaborate. The Committee issues a statement of its\r\ncase, and the party newspapers the Pravda and its affiliated organs are\r\ndeluged with its discussion. When this discussion has had time to spread\r\nthrough the country, congresses of Communists meet in the provincial\r\ncentres, and members of the Central Committee go down to these\r\nconferences to defend the \"theses\" which the Committee has issued. These\r\nprovincial congresses, exclusively Communist, send their delegates of\r\nan All-Russian Congress. There the \"theses\" of the Central Committee\r\nget altered, confirmed, or, in the case of an obviously unpersuaded\r\nand large opposition in the party, are referred back or in other ways\r\nshelved. Then the delegates, even those who have been in opposition at\r\nthe congress, go back to the country pledged to defend the position of\r\nthe majority. This sometimes has curious results. For example, I heard\r\nCommunist Trades Unionists fiercely arguing against certain clauses in\r\nthe theses on industrial conscription at a Communist Congress at the\r\nKremlin; less than a week afterwards I heard these same men defending\r\nprecisely these clauses at a Trades Union Congress over the way, they\r\nloyally abiding by the collective opinion of their fellow Communists\r\nand subject to particularly uncomfortable heckling from people who\r\nvociferously reminded them (since the Communist debates had been\r\npublished) that they were now defending what, a few days before, they\r\nhad vehemently attacked.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great strength of the Communist Party is comparable to the strength\r\nof the Jesuits, who, similarly, put themselves and their opinions at the\r\ndisposal of the body politic of their fellow members. Until a decision\r\nhad been made, a Communist is perfectly free to do his best to prevent\r\nit being made, to urge alterations in it, or to supply a rival decision,\r\nbut once it has been made he will support it without changing his\r\nprivate opinion. In all mixed congresses, rather than break the party\r\ndiscipline, he will give his vote for it, speak in favor of it, and use\r\nagainst its adversaries the very arguments that have been used against\r\nhimself. He has his share in electing the local Communist Committee,\r\nand, indirectly, in electing the all-powerful Central Committee of the\r\nparty, and he binds himself to do at any moment in his life exactly what\r\nthese Committees decide for him. These Committees decide the use that is\r\nto be made of the lives, not only of the rank and file of the party, but\r\nalso of their own members. Even a member of the Central Committee does\r\nnot escape. He may be voted by his fellow members into leaving a job\r\nhe likes and taking up another he detests in which they think his\r\nparticular talents will better serve the party aims. To become a member\r\nof the Communist Party involves a kind of intellectual abdication, or,\r\nto put it differently, a readiness at any moment to place the collective\r\nwisdom of the party's Committee above one's individual instincts or\r\nideas. You may influence its decisions, you may even get it to endorse\r\nyour own, but Lenin himself, if he were to fail on any occasion to\r\nobtain the agreement of a majority in the Central Committee, would have\r\nto do precisely what the Committee should tell him. Lenin's opinion\r\ncarries great weight because he is Lenin, but it carries less weight\r\nthan that of the Central Committee, of which he forms a nineteenth\r\npart. On the other hand, the opinion of Lenin and a very small group of\r\noutstanding figures is supported by great prestige inside the Committee,\r\nand that of the Committee is supported by overwhelming prestige among\r\nthe rank and file. The result is that this small group is nearly always\r\nsure of being able to use the whole vote of 600,000 Communists, in the\r\nrealization of its decisions.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow 600,000 men and women acting on the instructions of a highly\r\ncentralized directive, all the important decisions of which have been\r\nthrashed out and re-thrashed until they have general support within the\r\nparty; 600,000 men and women prepared, not only to vote in support of\r\nthese decisions, but with a carefully fostered readiness to sacrifice\r\ntheir lives for them if necessary; 600,000 men and women who are\r\npersuaded that by their way alone is humanity to be saved; who are\r\npersuaded (to put it as cynically and unsympathetically as possible)\r\nthat the noblest death one can die is in carrying out a decision of the\r\nCentral Committee; such a body, even in a country such as Russia, is an\r\nenormously strong embodiment of human will, an instrument of struggle\r\ncapable of working something very like miracles. It can be and is\r\ncontrolled like an army in battle. It can mobilize its members, 10 per\r\ncent. of them, 50 per cent., the local Committees choosing them, and\r\nsend them to the front when the front is in danger, or to the railways\r\nand repair shops when it is decided that the weakest point is that of\r\ntransport. If its only task were to fight those organizations of loosely\r\nknit and only momentarily united interests which are opposed to\r\nit, those jerry-built alliances of Reactionaries with Liberals,\r\nUnited-Indivisible-Russians with Ukrainians, Agrarians with\r\nSugar-Refiners, Monarchists with Republicans, that task would long ago\r\nhave been finished. But it has to fight something infinitely stronger\r\nthan these in fighting the economic ruin of Russia, which, if it is too\r\nstrong, too powerful to be arrested by the Communists, would make\r\nshort work of those who are without any such fanatic single-minded and\r\nperfectly disciplined organization.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA CONFERENCE AT JAROSLAVL\r\n\r\n\r\nI have already suggested that although the small Central Committee of\r\nthe Communist Party does invariably get its own way, there are essential\r\ndifferences between this Dictatorship and the dictatorship of, for\r\nexample, a General. The main difference is that whereas the General\r\nmerely writes an order about which most people hear for the first time\r\nonly when it is promulgated, the Central Committee prepares the way\r\nfor its dictation by a most elaborate series of discussions and counter\r\ndiscussions throughout the country, whereby it wins the bulk of the\r\nCommunist Party to its opinion, after which it proceeds through local\r\nand general congresses to do the same with the Trades Unions. This done,\r\na further series of propaganda meetings among the people actually to be\r\naffected smooths the way for the introduction of whatever new measure\r\nis being carried through at the moment. All this talk, besides lessening\r\nthe amount of physical force necessary in carrying out a decision, must\r\nalso avoid, at least in part, the deadening effect that would be caused\r\nby mere compulsory obedience to the unexplained orders of a military\r\ndictator. Of the reality of the Communist Dictatorship I have no sort\r\nof doubt. But its methods are such as tend towards the awakening of a\r\npolitical consciousness which, if and when normal conditions-of feeding\r\nand peace, for example-are attained, will make dictatorship of any kind\r\nalmost impossible.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo illustrate these methods of the Dictatorship, I cannot do better than\r\ncopy into this book some pages of my diary written in March of this year\r\nwhen I was present at one of the provincial conferences which were held\r\nin preparation of the All-Russian Communist Conference at the end of the\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt seven in the evening Radek called for me and took me to the Jaroslavl\r\nstation, where we met Larin, whom I had known in 1918. An old Menshevik,\r\nhe was the originator and most urgent supporter of the decree annulling\r\nthe foreign debts. He is a very ill man, partially paralyzed, having to\r\nuse both hands even to get food to his mouth or to turn over the leaves\r\nof a book. In spite of this he is one of the hardest workers in Russia,\r\nand although his obstinacy, his hatred of compromise, and a sort of\r\nmixed originality and perverseness keep him almost permanently at\r\nloggerheads with the Central Committee, he retains everybody's respect\r\nbecause of the real heroism with which he conquers physical disabilities\r\nwhich long ago would have overwhelmed a less unbreakable spirit. Both\r\nRadek and Larin were going to the Communist Conference at Jaroslavl\r\nwhich was to consider the new theses of the Central Committee of the\r\nparty with regard to Industrial Conscription. Radek was going to defend\r\nthe position of the Central Committee, Larin to defend his own. Both\r\nare old friends. As Radek said to me, he intended to destroy Larin's\r\nposition, but not, if he could help it, prevent Larin being nominated\r\namong the Jaroslavl delegates to All-Russian Conference which was in\r\npreparation. Larin, whose work keeps him continually traveling, has his\r\nown car, specially arranged so that his uninterrupted labor shall have\r\nas little effect as possible on his dangerously frail body. Radek and I\r\ntraveled in one of the special cars of the Central Executive Committee,\r\nof which he is a member.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe car seemed very clean, but, as an additional precaution, we began\r\nby rubbing turpentine on our necks and wrists and angles for the\r\ndiscouragement of lice, now generally known as \"Semashki\" from the name\r\nof Semashko, the Commissar of Public Health, who wages unceasing war\r\nfor their destruction as the carriers of typhus germs. I rubbed the\r\nturpentine so energetically into my neck that it burnt like a collar of\r\nfire, and for a long time I was unable to get to sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the morning Radek, the two conductors who had charge of the wagons\r\nand I sat down together to breakfast and had a very merry meal, they\r\nproviding cheese and bread and I a tin of corned beef providently sent\r\nout from home by the Manchester Guardian. We cooked up some coffee on\r\na little spirit stove, which, in a neat basket together with plates,\r\nknives, forks, etc. (now almost unobtainable in Russia) had been\r\na parting present from the German Spartacists to Radek when he was\r\nreleased from prison in Berlin and allowed to leave Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe morning was bright and clear, and we had an excellent view of\r\nJaroslavl when we drove from the station to the town, which is a mile or\r\nso off the line of the railway. The sun poured down on the white snow,\r\non the barges still frozen into the Volga River, and on the gilt and\r\npainted domes and cupolas of the town. Many of the buildings had been\r\ndestroyed during the rising artificially provoked in July, 1918, and its\r\nsubsequent suppression. More damage was done then than was necessary,\r\nbecause the town was recaptured by troops which had been deserted by\r\nmost of their officers, and therefore hammered away with artillery\r\nwithout any very definite plan of attack. The more important of the\r\ndamaged buildings, such as the waterworks and the power station, have\r\nbeen repaired, the tramway was working, and, after Moscow, the town\r\nseemed clean, but plenty of ruins remained as memorials of that wanton\r\nand unjustifiable piece of folly which, it was supposed, would be the\r\nsignal for a general rising.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe drove to the Hotel Bristol, now the headquarters of the Jaroslavl\r\nExecutive Committee, where Rostopchin, the president, discussed with\r\nLarin and Radek the programme arranged for the conference. It was then\r\nproposed that we should have something to eat, when a very curious state\r\nof affairs (and one extremely Russian) was revealed. Rostopchin admitted\r\nthat the commissariat arrangements of the Soviet and its Executive\r\nCommittee were very bad. But in the center of the town there is a\r\nnunnery which was very badly damaged during the bombardment and is now\r\nused as a sort of prison or concentration camp for a Labor Regiment.\r\nPeasants from the surrounding country who have refused to give up their\r\nproper contribution of corn, or leave otherwise disobeyed the laws, are,\r\nfor punishment, lodged here, and made to expiate their sins by work.\r\nIt so happens, Rostopchin explained, that the officer in charge of the\r\nprison feeding arrangements is a very energetic fellow, who had served\r\nin the old army in a similar capacity, and the meals served out to\r\nthe prisoners are so much better than those produced in the Soviet\r\nheadquarters, that the members of the Executive Committee make a\r\npractice of walking over to the prison to dine. They invited us to\r\ndo the same. Larin did not feel up to the walk, so he remained in the\r\nSoviet House to eat an inferior meal, while Radek and I, with Rostopchin\r\nand three other members of the local committee walked round to the\r\nprison. The bell tower of the old nunnery had been half shot away by\r\nartillery, and is in such a precarious condition that it is proposed\r\nto pull it down. But on passing under it we came into a wide courtyard\r\nsurrounded by two-story whitewashed buildings that seemed scarcely to\r\nhave suffered at all. We found the refectory in one of these buildings.\r\nIt was astonishingly clean. There were wooden tables, of course without\r\ncloths, and each man had a wooden spoon and a hunk of bread. A great\r\nbowl of really excellent soup was put down in the middle of table, and\r\nwe fell to hungrily enough. I made more mess on the table than any one\r\nelse, because it requires considerable practice to convey almost boiling\r\nsoup from a distant bowl to one's mouth without spilling it in a shallow\r\nwooden spoon four inches in diameter, and, having got it to one's mouth,\r\nto get any of it in without slopping over on either side. The regular\r\ndiners there seemed to find no difficulty in it at all. One of the\r\nprisoners who mopped up after my disasters said I had better join them\r\nfor a week, when I should find it quite easy. The soup bowl was followed\r\nby a fry of potatoes, quantities of which are grown in the district. For\r\ndealing with these I found the wooden spoon quite efficient. After that\r\nwe had glasses of some sort of substitute for tea.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Conference was held in the town theatre. There was a hint of comedy\r\nin the fact that the orchestra was playing the prelude to some very\r\ncheerful opera before the curtain rang up. Radek characteristically\r\nremarked that such music should be followed by something more\r\nsensational than a conference, proposed to me that we should form a\r\ntableau to illustrate the new peaceful policy of England with regard to\r\nRussia. As it was a party conference, I had really no right to be\r\nthere, but Radek had arranged with Rostopchin that I should come in with\r\nhimself, and be allowed to sit in the wings at the side of the stage.\r\nOn the stage were Rostopchin, Radek, Larin and various members of the\r\nCommunist Party Committee in the district. Everything was ready, but the\r\norchestra went on with its jig music on the other side of the curtain.\r\nA message was sent to them. The music stopped with a jerk. The curtain\r\nrose, disclosing a crowded auditorium. Everybody stood up, both on the\r\nstage and in the theater, and sang, accompanied by the orchestra, first\r\nthe \"Internationale\" and then the song for those who had died for the\r\nrevolution. Then except for two or three politically minded musicians,\r\nthe orchestra vanished away and the Conference began.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnlike many of the meetings and conferences at which I have been present\r\nin Russia, this Jaroslavl Conference seemed to me to include practically\r\nnone but men and women who either were or had been actual manual\r\nworkers. I looked over row after row of faces in the theatre, and could\r\nonly find two faces which I thought might be Jewish, and none that\r\nobviously belonged to the \"intelligentsia.\" I found on inquiry that only\r\nthree of the Communists present, excluding Radek and Larin, were old\r\nexiled and imprisoned revolutionaries of the educated class. Of these,\r\ntwo were on the platform. All the rest were from the working class. The\r\ngreat majority of them, of course, had joined the Communists in 1917,\r\nbut a dozen or so had been in the party as long as the first Russian\r\nrevolution of 1905.\r\n\r\n\r\nRadek, who was tremendously cheered (his long imprisonment in Germany,\r\nduring which time few in Russia thought that they would see him\r\nalive again, has made him something of a popular hero) made a long,\r\ninteresting and pugnacious speech setting out the grounds on which the\r\nCentral Committee base their ideas about Industrial Conscription.\r\nThese ideas are embodied in the series of theses issued by the Central\r\nCommittee in January (see p. 134). Larin, who was very tired after the\r\njourney and patently conscious that Radek was a formidable opponent,\r\nmade a speech setting out his reasons for differing with the Central\r\nCommittee, and proposed an ingenious resolution, which, while expressing\r\napproval of the general position of the Committee, included four\r\nsupplementary modifications which, as a matter of fact, nullified that\r\nposition altogether. It was then about ten at night, and the Conference\r\nadjourned. We drove round to the prison in sledges, and by way of supper\r\nhad some more soup and potatoes, and so back to the railway station to\r\nsleep in the cars.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext day the Conference opened about noon, when there was a long\r\ndiscussion of the points at issue. Workman after workman came to the\r\nplatform and gave his view. Some of the speeches were a little naive, as\r\nwhen one soldier said that Comrades Lenin and Trotsky had often before\r\npointed out difficult roads, and that whenever they had been followed\r\nthey had shown the way to victory, and that therefore, though there was\r\nmuch in the Central Committee's theses that was hard to digest, he was\r\nfor giving them complete support, confident that, as Comrades Lenin and\r\nTrotsky were in favor of them, they were likely to be right this time,\r\nas so often heretofore. But for the most part the speeches were directly\r\nconcerned with the problem under discussion, and showed a political\r\nconsciousness which would have been almost incredible three years ago.\r\nThe Red Army served as a text for many, who said that the methods which\r\nhad produced that army and its victories over the Whites had been proved\r\nsuccessful and should be used to produce a Red Army of Labor and similar\r\nvictories on the bloodless front against economic disaster. Nobody\r\nseemed to question the main idea of compulsory labor. The contest\r\nthat aroused real bitterness was between the methods of individual and\r\ncollegiate command. The new proposals lead eventually towards individual\r\ncommand, and fears were expressed lest this should mean putting\r\nsummary powers into the hands of bourgeois specialists, thus nullifying\r\n\"workers' control\". In reply, it was pointed out that individual command\r\nhad proved necessary in the army and had resulted in victory for the\r\nrevolution. The question was not between specialists and no specialists.\r\nEverybody knew that specialists were necessary. The question was how to\r\nget the most out of them. Effective political control had secured that\r\nbourgeois specialists, old officers, led to victory the army of the Red\r\nRepublic. The same result could be secured in the factories in the same\r\nway. It was pointed out that in one year they had succeeded in training\r\n32,000 Red Commanders, that is to say, officers from the working class\r\nitself, and that it was not Utopian to hope and work for a similar\r\noutput of workmen specialists, technically trained, and therefore\r\nthemselves qualified for individual command in the factories. Meanwhile\r\nthere was nothing against the employment of Political Commissars in\r\nthe factories as formerly in the regiments, to control in other than\r\ntechnical matters the doings of the specialists. On the other hand,\r\nit was said that the appointment of Commissars would tend to make\r\nCommunists unpopular, since inevitably in many cases they would have\r\nto support the specialists against the workmen, and that the collegiate\r\nsystem made the workmen feel that they were actually the masters, and so\r\ngave possibilities of enthusiastic work not otherwise obtainable. This\r\nlast point was hotly challenged. It was said that collegiate control\r\nmeant little in effect, except waste of time and efficiency, because at\r\nworst work was delayed by disputes and at best the workmen members\r\nof the college merely countersigned the orders decided upon by the\r\nspecialists. The enthusiastic work was said to be a fairy story. If it\r\nwere really to be found then there would be no need for a conference to\r\ndiscover how to get it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most serious opposition, or at least the most serious argument put\r\nforward, for there was less opposition than actual discussion, came from\r\nsome of the representatives of the Trade Unionists. A good deal was said\r\nabout the position of the Trades Unions in a Socialist State. There was\r\ngeneral recognition that since the Trade Unions themselves controlled\r\nthe conditions of labor and wages, the whole of their old work of\r\norganizing strikes against capitalists had ceased to have any meaning,\r\nsince to strike now would be to strike against their own decisions.\r\nAt the same time, certain tendencies to Syndicalism were still in\r\nexistence, tendencies which might well lead to conflict between\r\ndifferent unions, so that, for example, the match makers or the metal\r\nworker, might wish to strike a bargain with the State, as of one country\r\nwith another, and this might easily lead to a complete collapse of the\r\nsocialist system.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe one thing on which the speakers were in complete agreement was the\r\nabsolute need of an effort in industry equal to, if not greater than,\r\nthe effort made in the army. I thought it significant that in many\r\nof the speeches the importance of this effort was urged as the only\r\npossible means of retaining the support of the peasants. There was a\r\ntacit recognition that the Conference represented town workers only.\r\nLarin, who had belonged to the old school which had grown up with\r\nits eyes on the industrial countries of the West and believed that\r\nrevolution could be brought about by the town workers alone, that it\r\nwas exclusively their affair, and that all else was of minor importance,\r\nunguardedly spoke of the peasant as \"our neighbor.\" In Javoslavl,\r\ncountry and town are too near to allow the main problem of the\r\nrevolution to be thus easily dismissed. It was instantly pointed out\r\nthat the relation was much more intimate, and that, even if it were only\r\n\"neighborly,\" peace could not long be preserved if it were continually\r\nnecessary for one neighbor to steal the chickens of the other. These\r\ntown workers of a district for the most part agricultural were very sure\r\nthat the most urgent of all tasks was to raise industry to the point\r\nat which the town would really be able to supply the village with its\r\nneeds.\r\n\r\n\r\nLarin and Radek severally summed up and made final attacks on each\r\nother's positions, after which Radek's resolution approving the theses\r\nof the Central Committee was passed almost unanimously. Larin's four\r\namendments received 1, 3, 7 and 1 vote apiece. This result was received\r\nwith cheering throughout the theater, and showed the importance of such\r\nConferences in smoothing the way of the Dictatorship, since it had\r\nbeen quite obvious when the discussion began that a very much larger\r\nproportion of the delegates than finally voted for his resolution\r\nhad been more or less in sympathy with Larin in his opposition to the\r\nCentral Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere followed elections to the Party Conference in Moscow. Rostopchin,\r\nthe president, read a list which had been submitted by the various\r\nouyezds in the Jaroslavl Government. They were to send to Moscow fifteen\r\ndelegates with the right to vote, together with another fifteen with\r\nthe right to speak but not to vote. Larin, who had done much work in the\r\ndistrict, was mentioned as one of the fifteen voting delegates, but he\r\nstood up and said that as the Conference had so clearly expressed\r\nits disagreement with his views, he thought it better to withdraw his\r\ncandidature. Rostopchin put it to the Conference that although they\r\ndisagreed with Larin, yet it would be as well that he should have the\r\nopportunity of stating his views at the All-Russian Conference, so that\r\ndiscussion there should be as final and as many-sided as possible.\r\nThe Conference expressed its agreement with this. Larin withdrew\r\nhis withdrawal, and was presently elected. The main object of these\r\nconferences in unifying opinion and in arming Communists with argument\r\nfor the defence of this unified opinion a mong the masses was again\r\nillustrated when the Conference, in leaving it to the ouyezds to choose\r\nfor themselves the non-voting delegates urged them to select wherever\r\npossible people who would have the widest opportunities of explaining\r\non their return to the district whatever results might be reached in\r\nMoscow.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was now pretty late in the evening, and after another very\r\nsatisfactory visit to the prison we drove back to the station. Larin,\r\nwho was very disheartened, realizing that he had lost much support in\r\nthe course of the discussion, settled down to work, and buried himself\r\nin a mass of statistics. I prepared to go to bed, but we had hardly got\r\ninto the car when there was a tap at the door and a couple of railwaymen\r\ncame in. They explained that a few hundred yards away along the line a\r\nconcert and entertainment arranged by the Jaroslavl railwaymen was going\r\non, and that their committee, hearing that Radek was at the station, had\r\nsent them to ask him to come over and say a few words to them if he were\r\nnot too tired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Come along,\" said Radek, and we walked in the dark along the railway\r\nlines to a big one-story wooden shanty, where an electric lamp lit a\r\ngreat placard, \"Railwaymen's Reading Room.\" We went into a packed hall.\r\nEvery seat was occupied by railway workers and their wives and children.\r\nThe gangways on either side were full of those who had not found room on\r\nthe benches. We wriggled and pushed our way through this crowd, who were\r\nwatching a play staged and acted by the railwaymen themselves, to a side\r\ndoor, through which we climbed up into the wings, and slid across the\r\nstage behind the scenery into a tiny dressing-room. Here Radek was laid\r\nhold of by the Master of the Ceremonies, who, it seemed, was also part\r\neditor of a railwaymen's newspaper, and made to give a long account of\r\nthe present situation of Soviet Russia's Foreign Affairs. The little box\r\nof a room filled to a solid mass as policemen, generals and ladies of\r\nthe old regime threw off their costumes, and, in their working clothes,\r\nplain signalmen and engine-drivers, pressed round to listen. When the\r\nact ended, one of the railwaymen went to the front of the stage and\r\nannounced that Radek, who had lately come back after imprisonment in\r\nGermany for the cause of revolution, was going to talk to them about\r\nthe general state of affairs. I saw Radek grin at this forecast of his\r\nspeech. I understood why, when he began to speak. He led off by a direct\r\nand furious onslaught on the railway workers in general, demanding\r\nwork, work and more work, telling them that as the Red Army had been\r\nthe vanguard of the revolution hitherto, and had starved and fought and\r\ngiven lives to save those at home from Denikin and Kolchak, so now it\r\nwas the turn of the railway workers on whose efforts not only the Red\r\nArmy but also the whole future of Russia depended. He addressed himself\r\nto the women, telling them in very bad Russian that unless their men\r\nworked superhumanly they would see their babies die from starvation next\r\nwinter. I saw women nudge their husbands as they listened. Instead\r\nof giving them a pleasant, interesting sketch of the international\r\nposition, which, no doubt, was what they had expected, he took the\r\nopportunity to tell them exactly how things stood at home. And the\r\namazing thing was that they seemed to be pleased. They listened with\r\nextreme attention, wanted to turn out some one who had a sneezing fit\r\nat the far end of the hall, and nearly lifted the roof off with cheering\r\nwhen Radek had done. I wondered what sort of reception a man would have\r\nwho in another country interrupted a play to hammer home truths about\r\nthe need of work into an audience of working men who had gathered solely\r\nfor the purpose of legitimate recreation. It was not as if he sugared\r\nthe medicine he gave them. His speech was nothing but demands for\r\ndiscipline and work, coupled with prophecy of disaster in case work and\r\ndiscipline failed. It was delivered like all his speeches, with a strong\r\nPolish accent and a steady succession of mistakes in grammar.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we walked home along the railway lines, half a dozen of the\r\nrailwaymen pressed around Radek, and almost fought with each other as to\r\nwho should walk next to him. And Radek entirely happy, delighted at his\r\nsuccess in giving them a bombshell instead of a bouquet, with one stout\r\nfellow on one arm, another on the other, two or three more listening in\r\nfront and behind, continued rubbing it into them until we reached our\r\nwagon, when, after a general handshaking, they disappeared into the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRADE UNIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nTrade Unions in Russia are in a different position from that which is\r\ncommon to all other Trades Unions in the world. In other countries the\r\nTrades Unions are a force with whose opposition the Government must\r\nreckon. In Russia the Government reckons not on the possible opposition\r\nof the Trades Unions, but on their help for realizing its most difficult\r\nmeasures, and for undermining and overwhelming any opposition which\r\nthose measures may encounter. The Trades Unions in Russia, instead of\r\nbeing an organization outside the State protecting the interests of\r\na class against the governing class, have become a part of the State\r\norganization. Since, during the present period of the revolution the\r\nbackbone of the State organization is the Communist Party, the\r\nTrade Unions have come to be practically an extension of the party\r\norganization. This, of course, would be indignantly denied both by\r\nTrade Unionists and Communists. Still, in the preface to the All-Russian\r\nTrades Union Reports for 1919, Glebov, one of the best-known Trade Union\r\nleaders whom I remember in the spring of last year objecting to the use\r\nof bourgeois specialists in their proper places, admits as much in the\r\nfollowing muddleheaded statement:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The base of the proletarian dictatorship is the Communist Party, which\r\nin general directs all the political and economic work of the State,\r\nleaning, first of all, on the Soviets as on the more revolutionary form\r\nof dictatorship of the proletariat, and secondly on the Trades Unions,\r\nas organizations which economically unite the proletariat of factory and\r\nworkshop as the vanguard of the revolution, and as organizations of the\r\nnew socialistic construction of the State. Thus the Trade Unions must\r\nbe considered as a base of the Soviet State, as an organic form\r\ncomplementary to the other forms of the Proletariat Dictatorship.\" These\r\ntwo elaborate sentences constitute an admission of what I have just\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\r\nTrades Unionists of other countries must regard the fate of their\r\nRussian colleagues with horror or with satisfaction, according to their\r\nviews of events in Russia taken as a whole. If they do not believe\r\nthat there has been a social revolution in Russia, they must regard\r\nthe present position of the Russian Trades Unions as the reward of a\r\ncomplete defeat of Trade Unionism, in which a Capitalist government has\r\nbeen able to lay violent hands on the organization which was protecting\r\nthe workers against it. If, on the other hand, they believe that there\r\nhas been a social revolution, so that the class organized in Trades\r\nUnions is now, identical with the governing, class (of employers, etc.)\r\nagainst which the unions once struggled, then they must regard the\r\npresent position as a natural and satisfactory result of victory.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I was in Moscow in the spring of this year the Russian Trades\r\nUnions received a telegram from the Trades Union Congress at Amsterdam,\r\na telegram which admirably illustrated the impossibility of separating\r\njudgment of the present position of the Unions from judgments of the\r\nRussian revolution as a whole. It encouraged the Unions \"in their\r\nstruggle\" and promised support in that struggle. The Communists\r\nimmediately asked \"What struggle? Against the capitalist system in\r\nRussia which does not exist? Or against capitalist systems outside\r\nRussia?\" They said that either the telegram meant this latter only, or\r\nit meant that its writers did not believe that there had been a social\r\nrevolution in Russia. The point is arguable. If one believes that\r\nrevolution is an impossibility, one can reason from that belief and say\r\nthat in spite of certain upheavals in Russia the fundamental arrangement\r\nof society is the same there as in other countries, so that the position\r\nof the Trade Unions there must be the same, and, as in other countries\r\nthey must be still engaged in augmenting the dinners of their members at\r\nthe expense of the dinners of the capitalists which, in the long run\r\n(if that were possible) they would abolish. If, on the other hand,\r\none believes that social revolution has actually occurred, to speak of\r\nTrades Unions continuing the struggle in which they conquered something\r\nlike three years ago, is to urge them to a sterile fanaticism which has\r\nbeen neatly described by Professor Santayana as a redoubling of your\r\neffort when you have forgotten your aim.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt 's probably true that the \"aim\" of the Trades Unions was more clearly\r\ndefined in Russia than elsewhere. In England during the greater part of\r\ntheir history the Trades Unions have not been in conscious opposition\r\nto the State. In Russia this position was forced on the Trades Unions\r\nalmost before they had time to get to work. They were born, so to speak,\r\nwith red flags in their hands. They grew up under circumstances of\r\nextreme difficulty and persecution. From 1905 on they were in decided\r\nopposition to the existing system, and were revolutionary rather than\r\nmerely mitigatory organizations.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore 1905 they were little more than associations for mutual help,\r\nvery weak, spending most of their energies in self-preservation from the\r\npolice, and hiding their character as class organizations by electing\r\nmore or less Liberal managers and employers as \"honorary members.\" 1905,\r\nhowever, settled their revolutionary character. In September of that\r\nyear there was a Conference at Moscow, where it was decided to call\r\nan All-Russian Trades Union Congress. Reaction in Russia made this\r\nimpossible, and the most they could do was to have another small\r\nConference in February, 1906, which, however, defined their object as\r\nthat of creating a general Trade Union Movement organized on All-Russian\r\nlines. The temper of the Trades Unions then, and the condition of the\r\ncountry at that time, may be judged from the fact that although they\r\nwere merely working for the right to form Unions, the right to strike,\r\netc., they passed the following significant resolution: \"Neither from\r\nthe present Government nor from the future State Duma can be expected\r\nrealization of freedom of coalition. This Conference considers the\r\nlegalization of the Trades Unions under present conditions absolutely\r\nimpossible.\" The Conference was right. For twelve years after that there\r\nwere no Trades Unions Conferences in Russia. Not until June, 1917, three\r\nmonths after the March Revolution, was the third Trade Union Conference\r\nable to meet. This Conference reaffirmed the revolutionary character of\r\nthe Russian Trades Unions.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt that time the dominant party in the Soviets was that of the\r\nMensheviks, who were opposed to the formation of a Soviet Government,\r\nand were supporting the provisional Cabinet of Kerensky. The Trades\r\nUnions were actually at that time more revolutionary than the Soviets.\r\nThis third Conference passed several resolutions, which show clearly\r\nenough that the present position of the Unions has not been brought\r\nabout by any violence of the Communists from without, but was definitely\r\npromised by tendencies inside the Unions at a time when the Communists\r\nwere probably the least authoritative party in Russia. This Conference\r\nof June, 1917, resolved that the Trades Unions should not only \"remain\r\nmilitant class organizations... but... should support the activities of\r\nthe Soviets of soldiers and deputies.\" They thus clearly showed on which\r\nside they stood in the struggle then proceeding. Nor was this all. They\r\nalso, though the Mensheviks were still the dominant party, resolved\r\non that system of internal organizations and grouping, which has\r\nbeen actually realized under the Communists. I quote again from the\r\nresolution of this Conference:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The evolution of the economic struggle demands from the workers\r\nsuch forms of professional organization as, basing themselves on\r\nthe connection between various groups of workers in the process of\r\nproduction, should unite within a general organization, and under\r\ngeneral leadership, as large masses of workers as possible occupied\r\nin enterprises of the same kind, or in similar professions. With this\r\nobject the workers should organize themselves professionally, not by\r\nshops or trades, but by productions, so that all the workers of a given\r\nenterprise should belong to one Union, even if they belong to different\r\nprofessions and even different productions.\" That which was then no\r\nmore than a design is now an accurate description of Trades Union\r\norganization in Russia. Further, much that at present surprises the\r\nforeign inquirer was planned and considered desirable then, before the\r\nCommunists had won a majority either in the Unions or in the Soviet.\r\nThus this same third Conference resolved that \"in the interests of\r\ngreater efficiency and success in the economic struggle, a professional\r\norganization should be built on the principle of democratic centralism,\r\nassuring to every member a share in the affairs of the organization and,\r\nat the same time, obtaining unity in the leadership of the struggle.\"\r\nFinally \"Unity in the direction (leadership) of the economic struggle\r\ndemands unity in the exchequer of the Trades Unions.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe point that I wish to make in thus illustrating the pre-Communist\r\ntendencies of the Russian Trades Unions is not simply that if their\r\npresent position is undesirable they have only themselves to thank for\r\nit, but that in Russia the Trades Union movement before the October\r\nRevolution was working in the direction of such a revolution, that the\r\nevents of October represented something like a Trade Union victory,\r\nso that the present position of the Unions as part of the organization\r\ndefending that victory, as part of the system of government set up by\r\nthat revolution, is logical and was to be expected. I have illustrated\r\nthis from resolutions, because these give statements in words easily\r\ncomparable with what has come to pass. It would be equally easy to point\r\nto deeds instead of words if we need more forcible though less accurate\r\nillustrations.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus, at the time of the Moscow Congress the Soviets, then Mensheviks,\r\nwho were represented at the Congress (the object of the Congress was to\r\nwhip up support for the Coalition Government) were against strikes\r\nof protest. The Trades Unions took a point of view nearer that of\r\nthe Bolsheviks, and the strikes in Moscow took place in spite of the\r\nSoviets. After the Kornilov affair, when the Mensheviks were still\r\nstruggling for coalition with the bourgeois parties, the Trades Unions\r\nquite definitely took the Bolshevik standpoint. At the so-called\r\nDemocratic Conference, intended as a sort of life belt for the sinking\r\nProvisional Government, only eight of the Trades Union delegates voted\r\nfor a continuance of the coalition, whereas seventy three voted against.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis consciously revolutionary character throughout their much shorter\r\nexistence has distinguished Russian from, for example, English Trades\r\nUnions. It has set their course for them.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn October, 1917, they got the revolution for which they had been asking\r\nsince March. Since then, one Congress after another has illustrated\r\nthe natural and inevitable development of Trades Unions inside a\r\nrevolutionary State which, like most if not all revolutionary States, is\r\nattacked simultaneously by hostile armies from without and by economic\r\nparalysis from within. The excited and lighthearted Trades Unionists\r\nof three years ago, who believed that the mere decreeing of \"workers'\r\ncontrol\" would bring all difficulties automatically to an end, are now\r\nunrecognizable. We have seen illusion after illusion scraped from them\r\nby the pumice-stone of experience, while the appalling state of the\r\nindustries which they now largely control, and the ruin of the country\r\nin which they attained that control, have forced them to alter their\r\nimmediate aims to meet immediate dangers, and have accelerated the\r\nprocess of adaptation made inevitable by their victory.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe process of adaptation has had the natural result of producing new\r\ninternal cleavages. Change after change in their programme and theory\r\nof the Russian Trades Unionists has been due to the pressure of life\r\nitself, to the urgency of struggling against the worsening of conditions\r\nalready almost unbearable. It is perfectly natural that those Unions\r\nwhich hold back from adaptation and resent the changes are precisely\r\nthose which, like that of the printers, are not intimately concerned in\r\nany productive process, are consequently outside the central struggle,\r\nand, while feeling the discomforts of change, do not feel its need.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe opposition inside the productive Trades Unions is of two kinds.\r\nThere is the opposition, which is of merely psychological interest, of\r\nold Trades Union leaders who have always thought of themselves as in\r\nopposition to the Government, and feel themselves like watches without\r\nmainsprings in their new role of Government supporters. These are men\r\nin whom a natural intellectual stiffness makes difficult the complete\r\nchange of front which was the logical result of the revolution for which\r\nthey had been working. But beside that there is a much more interesting\r\nopposition based on political considerations. The Menshevik standpoint\r\nis one of disbelief in the permanence of the revolution, or rather in\r\nthe permanence of the victory of the town workers. They point to the\r\ndivergence in interests between the town and country populations,\r\nand are convinced that sooner or later the peasants will alter the\r\ngovernment to suit themselves, when, once more, it will be a government\r\nagainst which the town workers will have to defend their interests. The\r\nMensheviks object to the identification of the Trades Unions with the\r\nGovernment apparatus on the ground that when this change, which they\r\nexpect comes about, the Trade Union movement will be so far emasculated\r\nas to be incapable of defending the town workers against the peasants\r\nwho will then be the ruling class. Thus they attack the present Trades\r\nUnion leaders for being directly influenced by the Government in fixing\r\nthe rate of wages, on the ground that this establishes a precedent from\r\nwhich, when the change comes, it will be difficult to break away. The\r\nCommunists answer them by insisting that it is to everybody's interest\r\nto pull Russia through the crisis, and that if the Trades Unions were\r\nfor such academic reasons to insist on their complete independence\r\ninstead of in every possible way collaborating with the Government, they\r\nwould be not only increasing the difficulties of the revolution in\r\nits economic crisis, but actually hastening that change which the\r\nMensheviks, though they regard it as inevitable, cannot be supposed\r\nto desire. This Menshevik opposition is strongest in the Ukraine. Its\r\nstrength may be judged from the figures of the Congress in Moscow\r\nthis spring when, of 1,300 delegates, over 1,000 were Communists or\r\nsympathizers with them; 63 were Mensheviks and 200 were non-party, the\r\nbulk of whom, I fancy, on this point would agree with the Mensheviks.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut apart from opposition to the \"stratification\" of the Trades Unions,\r\nthere is a cleavage cutting across the Communist Party itself and\r\nuniting in opinion, though not in voting, the Mensheviks and a section\r\nof their Communist opponents. This cleavage is over the question of\r\n\"workers' control.\" Most of those who, before the revolution, looked\r\nforward to the \"workers' control\", thought of it as meaning that the\r\nactual workers in a given factory would themselves control that factory,\r\njust as a board of directors controls a factory under the ordinary\r\ncapitalist system. The Communists, I think, even today admit the\r\nultimate desirability of this, but insist that the important question is\r\nnot who shall give the orders, but in whose interest the orders shall\r\nbe given. I have nowhere found this matter properly thrashed out, though\r\nfeeling upon it is extremely strong. Everybody whom I asked about it\r\nbegan at once to address me as if I were a public meeting, so that I\r\nfound it extremely difficult to get from either side a statement not\r\nfree from electioneering bias. I think, however, that it may be fairly\r\nsaid that all but a few lunatics have abandoned the ideas of 1917, which\r\nresulted in the workmen in a factory deposing any technical expert or\r\nmanager whose orders were in the least irksome to them. These ideas\r\nand the miseries and unfairness they caused, the stoppages of work, the\r\nmanagers sewn up in sacks, ducked in ponds and trundled in wheelbarrows,\r\nhave taken their places as curiosities of history. The change in these\r\nideas has been gradual. The first step was the recognition that the\r\nState as a whole was interested in the efficiency of each factory, and,\r\ntherefore, that the workmen of each factory had no right to arrange\r\nthings with no thought except for themselves. The Committee idea was\r\nstill strong, and the difficulty was got over by assuring that the\r\ntechnical staff should be represented on the Committee, and that the\r\ncasting vote between workers and technical experts or managers should\r\nbelong to the central economic organ of the State. The next stage was\r\nwhen the management of a workshop was given a so called \"collegiate\"\r\ncharacter, the workmen appointing representatives to share the\r\nresponsibility of the \"bourgeois specialist.\" The bitter controversy now\r\ngoing on concerns the seemingly inevitable transition to a later stage\r\nin which, for all practical purposes, the bourgeois specialist will be\r\nresponsible solely to the State. Many Communists, including some of\r\nthe best known, while recognizing the need of greater efficiency if\r\nthe revolution is to survive at all, regard this step as definitely\r\nretrograde and likely in the long run to make the revolution not worth\r\npreserving. [*]\r\n\r\n     * Thus Rykov, President of the Supreme Council of Public\r\n     Economy: \"There is a possibility of so constructing a State\r\n     that in it there will be a ruling caste consisting chiefly\r\n     of administrative engineers, technicians, etc.; that is, we\r\n     should get a form of State economy based on a small group of\r\n     a ruling caste whose privilege in this case would be the\r\n     management of the workers and peasants.\" That criticism of\r\n     individual control, from a communist, goes a good deal\r\n     further than most of the criticism from people avowedly in\r\n     opposition.] The enormous importance attached by everybody\r\n     to this question of individual or collegiate control, may\r\n     be judged from the fact that at every conference I attended,\r\n     and every discussion to which I listened, this point, which\r\n     might seem of minor importance, completely overshadowed the\r\n     question of industrial conscription which, at least inside\r\n     the Communist Party, seemed generally taken for granted. It\r\n     may be taken now as certain that the majority of the\r\n     Communists are in favor of individual control. They say that\r\n     the object of \"workers' control\" before the revolution was\r\n     to ensure that factories should be run in the interests of\r\n     workers as well of employers. In Russia now there are no\r\n     employers other than the State as a whole, which is\r\n     exclusively made up of employees. (I am stating now the view\r\n     of the majority at the last Trades Union Congress at which I\r\n     was present, April, 1920.) They say that \"workers' control\"\r\n     exists in a larger and more efficient manner than was\r\n     suggested by the old pre-revolutionary statements on that\r\n     question. Further, they say that if workers' control ought\r\n     to be identified with Trade Union control, the Trades Unions\r\n     are certainly supreme in all those matters with which they\r\n     have chiefly concerned themselves, since they dominate the\r\n     Commissariat of Labor, are very largely represented on the\r\n     Supreme Council of Public Economy, and fix the rates of pay\r\n     for their own members. [*]\r\n\r\n     * The wages of workmen are decided by the Trades Unions, who\r\n     draw up \"tariffs\" for the whole country, basing their\r\n     calculations on three criteria: (I) The price of food in the\r\n     open market in the district where a workman is employed,\r\n     (2)the price of food supplied by the State on the card\r\n     system, (3)the quality of the workman. This last is decided\r\n     by a special section of the Factory Committee, which in each\r\n     factory is an organ of the Trades Union.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe enormous Communist majority, together with the fact that however\r\nmuch they may quarrel with each other inside the party, the Communists\r\nwill go to almost any length to avoid breaking the party discipline,\r\nmeans that at present the resolutions of Trades Union Congresses\r\nwill not be different from those of Communists Congresses on the same\r\nsubjects. Consequently, the questions which really agitate the members,\r\nthe actual cleavages inside that Communist majority, are comparatively\r\ninvisible at a Trades Union Congress. They are fought over with great\r\nbitterness, but they are not fought over in the Hall of the Unions-once\r\nthe Club of the Nobility, with on its walls on Congress days the hammer\r\nand spanner of the engineers, the pestle and trowel of the builders, and\r\nso on-but in the Communist Congresses in the Kremlin and throughout\r\nthe country. And, in the problem with which in this book we are mainly\r\nconcerned, neither the regular business of the Unions nor their internal\r\nsquabbles affects the cardinal fact that in the present crisis the\r\nTrades Unions are chiefly important as part of that organization of\r\nhuman will with which the Communists are attempting to arrest the steady\r\nprogress of Russia's economic ruin. Putting it brutally, so as to offend\r\nTrades Unionists and Communists alike, they are an important part of the\r\nCommunist system of internal propaganda, and their whole organization\r\nacts as a gigantic megaphone through which the Communist Party makes\r\nknown its fears, its hopes and its decisions to the great masses of the\r\nindustrial workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROPAGANDA TRAINS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I crossed the Russian front in October, 1919, the first thing I\r\nnoticed in peasants' cottages, in the villages, in the little town where\r\nI took the railway to Moscow, in every railway station along the line,\r\nwas the elaborate pictorial propaganda concerned with the war. There\r\nwere posters showing Denizen standing straddle over Russia's coal, while\r\nthe factory chimneys were smokeless and the engines idle in the yards,\r\nwith the simplest wording to show why it was necessary to beat Denizen\r\nin order to get coal; there were posters illustrating the treatment\r\nof the peasants by the Whites; posters against desertion, posters\r\nillustrating the Russian struggle against the rest of the world, showing\r\na workman, a peasant, a sailor and a soldier fighting in self-defence\r\nagainst an enormous Capitalistic Hydra. There were also-and this I took\r\nas a sign of what might be-posters encouraging the sowing of corn, and\r\nposters explaining in simple pictures improved methods of agriculture.\r\nOur own recruiting propaganda during the war, good as that was, was\r\nnever developed to such a point of excellence, and knowing the general\r\nslowness with which the Russian centre reacts on its periphery, I\r\nwas amazed not only at the actual posters, but at their efficient\r\ndistribution thus far from Moscow.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have had an opportunity of seeing two of the propaganda trains, the\r\nobject of which is to reduce the size of Russia politically by bringing\r\nMoscow to the front and to the out of the way districts, and so to\r\nlessen the difficulty of obtaining that general unity of purpose which\r\nit is the object of propaganda to produce. The fact that there is some\r\nhope that in the near future the whole of this apparatus may be turned\r\nover to the propaganda of industry makes it perhaps worth while to\r\ndescribe these trains in detail.\r\n\r\n\r\nRussia, for purposes of this internal propaganda, is divided into\r\nfive sections, and each section has its own train, prepared for the\r\nparticular political needs of the section it serves, bearing its own\r\nname, carrying its regular crew-a propaganda unit, as corporate as the\r\ncrew of a ship. The five trains at present in existence are the \"Lenin,\"\r\nthe \"Sverdlov,\" the \"October Revolution,\" the \"Red East,\" which is now\r\nin Turkestan, and the \"Red Cossack,\" which, ready to start for Rostov\r\nand the Don, was standing, in the sidings at the Kursk station, together\r\nwith the \"Lenin,\" returned for refitting and painting.\r\n\r\n\r\nBurov, the organizer of these trains, a ruddy, enthusiastic little\r\nman in patched leather coat and breeches, took a party of foreigners-a\r\nSwede, a Norwegian, two Czechs, a German and myself to visit his trains,\r\ntogether with Radek, in the hope that Radek would induce Lenin to visit\r\nthem, in which case Lenin would be kinematographed for the delight of\r\nthe villagers, and possibly the Central Committee would, if Lenin were\r\ninterested, lend them more lively support.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe walked along the \"Lenin\" first, at Burov's special request. Burov,\r\nit seems, has only recently escaped from what he considered a bitter\r\naffliction due to the Department of Proletarian Culture, who, in the\r\nbeginning, for the decoration of his trains, had delivered him bound\r\nhand and foot to a number of Futurists. For that reason he wanted us to\r\nsee the \"Lenin\" first, in order that we might compare it with the result\r\nof his emancipation, the \"Red Cossack,\" painted when the artists \"had\r\nbeen brought under proper control.\" The \"Lenin\" had been painted a year\r\nand a half ago, when, as fading hoarding in the streets of Moscow still\r\ntestify, revolutionary art was dominated by the Futurist movement. Every\r\ncarriage is decorated with most striking but not very comprehensible\r\npictures in the brightest colors, and the proletariat was called upon to\r\nenjoy what the pre-revolutionary artistic public had for the most part\r\nfailed to understand. Its pictures are \"art for art's sake,\" and cannot\r\nhave done more than astonish, and perhaps terrify, the peasants and\r\nthe workmen of the country towns who had the luck to see them. The \"Red\r\nCossack\" is quite different. As Burov put it with deep satisfaction,\r\n\"At first we were in the artists' hands, and now the artists are in\r\nour hands,\" a sentence suggesting the most horrible possibilities of\r\nofficial art under socialism, although, of course, bad art flourishes\r\npretty well even under other systems.\r\n\r\n\r\nI inquired exactly how Burov and his friends kept the artists in the\r\nright way, and received the fullest explanation. The political section\r\nof the organization works out the main idea and aim for each picture,\r\nwhich covers the whole side of a wagon. This idea is then submitted to a\r\n\"collective\" of artists, who are jointly responsible for its realization\r\nin paint. The artists compete with each other for a prize which is\r\nawarded for the best design, the judges being the artists themselves. It\r\nis the art of the poster, art with a purpose of the most definite kind.\r\nThe result is sometimes amusing, interesting, startling, but, whatever\r\nelse it does, hammers home a plain idea.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus the picture on the side of one wagon is divided into two sections.\r\nOn the left is a representation of the peasants and workmen of the\r\nSoviet Republic. Under it are the words, \"Let us not find ourselves\r\nagain...\" and then, in gigantic lettering under the right-hand section\r\nof the picture, \"... in the HEAVEN OF THE WHITES.\" This heaven is shown\r\nby an epauletted officer hitting a soldier in the face, as was done in\r\nthe Tsar's army and in at least one army of the counter revolutionaries,\r\nand workmen tied to stakes, as was done by the Whites in certain towns\r\nin the south. Then another wagon illustrating the methods of Tsardom,\r\nwith a State vodka shop selling its wares to wretched folk, who, when\r\ndrunk on the State vodka, are flogged by the State police. Then there\r\nis a wagon showing the different Cossacks-of the Don, Terek, Kuban,\r\nUral-riding in pairs. The Cossack infantry is represented on the other\r\nside of this wagon. On another wagon is a very jolly picture of Stenka\r\nRazin in his boat with little old-fashioned brass cannon, rowing up the\r\nriver. Underneath is written the words: \"I attack only the rich, with\r\nthe poor I divide everything.\" On one side are the poor folk running\r\nfrom their huts to join him, on the other the rich folk firing at him\r\nfrom their castle. One wagon is treated purely decoratively, with a\r\nbroad effective characteristically South Russian design, framing a\r\nhuge inscription to the effect that the Cossacks need not fear that\r\nthe Soviet Republic will interfere with their religion, since under its\r\nregime every man is to be free to believe exactly what he likes. Then\r\nthere is an entertaining wagon, showing Kolchak sitting inside a fence\r\nin Siberia with a Red soldier on guard, Judenitch sitting in a little\r\ncircle with a sign-post to show it is Esthonia, and Denikin running at\r\nfull speed to the asylum indicated by another sign-post on which is the\r\ncrescent of the Turkish Empire. Another lively picture shows the young\r\nCossack girls learning to read, with a most realistic old Cossack woman\r\ntelling them they had better not. But there is no point in describing\r\nevery wagon. There are sixteen wagons in the \"Red Cossack,\" and every\r\none is painted all over on both sides.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe internal arrangements of the train are a sufficient proof that\r\nRussians are capable of organization if they set their minds to it.\r\nWe went through it, wagon by wagon. One wagon contains a wireless\r\ntelegraphy station capable of receiving news from such distant stations\r\nas those of Carnarvon or Lyons. Another is fitted up as a newspaper\r\noffice, with a mechanical press capable of printing an edition of\r\nfifteen thousand daily, so that the district served by the train,\r\nhowever out of the way, gets its news simultaneously with Moscow, many\r\ndays sometimes before the belated Izvestia or Pravda finds its way to\r\nthem. And with its latest news it gets its latest propaganda, and in\r\norder to get the one it cannot help getting the other. Next door to that\r\nthere is a kinematograph wagon, with benches to seat about one hundred\r\nand fifty persons. But indoor performances are only given to children,\r\nwho must come during the daytime, or in summer when the evenings are too\r\nlight to permit an open air performance. In the ordinary way, at night,\r\na great screen is fixed up in the open. There is a special hole cut in\r\nthe side of the wagon, and through this the kinematograph throws its\r\npicture on the great screen outside, so that several thousands can see\r\nit at once. The enthusiastic Burov insisted on working through a couple\r\nof films for us, showing the Communists boy scouts in their country\r\ncamps, children's meetings in Petrograd, and the big demonstrations\r\nof last year in honor of the Third International. He was extremely\r\ndisappointed that Radek, being in a hurry, refused to wait for a\r\nperformance of \"The Father and his Son,\" a drama which, he assured us\r\nwith tears in his eyes, was so thrilling that we should not regret being\r\nlate for our appointments if we stayed to witness it. Another wagon is\r\nfitted up as an electric power-station, lighting the train, working the\r\nkinematograph and the printing machine, etc. Then there is a clean little\r\nkitchen and dining-room, where, before being kinematographed-a horrible\r\nexperience when one is first quite seriously begged (of course by Burov)\r\nto assume an expression of intelligent interest--we had soup, a plate of\r\nmeat and cabbage, and tea. Then there is a wagon bookshop, where, while\r\ncustomers buy books, a gramophone sings the revolutionary songs of\r\nDemian Bledny, or speaks with the eloquence of Trotsky or the logic of\r\nLenin. Other wagons are the living-rooms of the personnel, divided up\r\naccording to their duties-political, military, instructional, and so\r\nforth. For the train has not merely an agitational purpose. It carries\r\nwith it a staff to give advice to local authorities, to explain what\r\nhas not been understood, and so in every way to bring the ideas of the\r\nCentre quickly to the backwoods of the Republic. It works also in the\r\nopposite direction, helping to make the voice of the backwoods heard\r\nat Moscow. This is illustrated by a painted pillar-box on one of the\r\nwagons, with a slot for letters, labelled, \"For Complaints of Every\r\nKind.\" Anybody anywhere who has grievance, thinks he is being unfairly\r\ntreated, or has a suggestion to make, can speak with the Centre in\r\nthis way. When the train is on a voyage telegrams announce its\r\narrival beforehand, so that the local Soviets can make full use of\r\nits advantages, arranging meetings, kinematograph shows, lectures.\r\nIt arrives, this amazing picture train, and proceeds to publish and\r\ndistribute its newspapers, sell its books (the bookshop, they tell me,\r\nis literally stormed at every stopping place), send books and posters\r\nfor forty versts on either side of the line with the motor-cars which it\r\ncarries with it, and enliven the population with its kinematograph.\r\n\r\n\r\nI doubt if a more effective instrument of propaganda has ever been\r\ndevised. And in considering the question whether or no the Russians will\r\nbe able after organizing their military defence to tackle with similar\r\ncomparative success the much more difficult problem of industrial\r\nrebirth, the existence of such instruments, the use of such propaganda\r\nis a factor not to be neglected. In the spring of this year, when the\r\ncivil war seemed to be ending, when there was a general belief that\r\nthe Poles would accept the peace that Russia offered (they ignored this\r\noffer, advanced, took Kiev, were driven back to Warsaw, advanced again,\r\nand finally agreed to terms which they could have had in March without\r\nbloodshed any kind), two of these propaganda trains were already being\r\nrepainted with a new purpose. It was hoped that in the near future all\r\nfive trains would be explaining not the need to fight but the need to\r\nwork. Undoubtedly, at the first possible moment, the whole machinery of\r\nagitation, of posters, of broadsheets and of trains, will be turned over\r\nto the task of explaining the Government's plans for reconstruction,\r\nand the need for extraordinary concentration, now on transport, now on\r\nsomething else, that these plans involve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSATURDAYINGS\r\n\r\n\r\nSo much for the organization, with its Communist Party, its system of\r\nmeetings and counter-meetings, its adapted Trades Unions, its infinitely\r\nvarious propaganda, which is doing its best to make headway against\r\nruin. I want now to describe however briefly, the methods it has adopted\r\nin tackling the worst of all Russia's problems-the non-productivity and\r\nabsolute shortage of labor.\r\n\r\n\r\nI find a sort of analogy between these methods and those which we used\r\nin England in tackling the similar cumulative problem of finding men for\r\nwar. Just as we did not proceed at once to conscription, but began by\r\na great propaganda of voluntary effort, so the Communists, faced with\r\na need at least equally vital, did not turn at once to industrial\r\nconscription. It was understood from the beginning that the Communists\r\nthemselves were to set an example of hard work, and I dare say a\r\nconsiderable proportion of them did so. Every factory had its little\r\nCommunist Committee, which was supposed to leaven the factory with\r\nenthusiasm, just as similar groups of Communists drafted into the armies\r\nin moments of extreme danger did, on more than one occasion, as the\r\nnon-Communist Commander-in-Chief admits, turn a rout into a stand and\r\nsnatch victory from what looked perilously like defeat. But this was\r\nnot enough, arrears of work accumulated, enthusiasm waned, productivity\r\ndecreased, and some new move was obviously necessary. This first move in\r\nthe direction of industrial conscription, although no one perceived its\r\ntendency at the time, was the inauguration of what have become known as\r\n\"Saturdayings\".\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly in 1919 the Central Committee of the Communist Party put out a\r\ncircular letter, calling upon the Communists \"to work revolutionally,\"\r\nto emulate in the rear the heroism of their brothers on the front,\r\npointing out that nothing but the most determined efforts and an\r\nincrease in the productivity of labor would enable Russia to win through\r\nher difficulties of transport, etc. Kolchak, to quote from English\r\nnewspapers, was it \"sweeping on to Moscow,\" and the situation was pretty\r\nthreatening. As a direct result of this letter, on May 7th, a meeting\r\nof Communists in the sub-district of the Moscow-Kazan railway passed\r\na resolution that, in view of the imminent danger to the Republic,\r\nCommunists and their sympathizers should give up an hour a day of their\r\nleisure, and, lumping these hours together, do every Saturday six hours\r\nof manual labor; and, further, that these Communist \"Saturdayings\"\r\nshould be continued \"until complete victory over Kolchak should be\r\nassured.\" That decision of a local committee was the actual beginning of\r\na movement which spread all over Russia, and though the complete victory\r\nover Kolchak was long ago obtained, is likely to continue so long as\r\nSoviet Russia is threatened by any one else.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe decision was put into effect on May 10th, when the first Communist\r\n\"Saturdaying\" in Russia took place on the Moscow-Kazan railway. The\r\nCommissar of the railway, Communist clerks from the offices, and every\r\none else who wished to help, marched to work, 182 in all, and put in\r\n1,012 hours of manual labor, in which they finished the repairs of four\r\nlocomotives and sixteen wagons and loaded and unloaded 9,300 poods of\r\nengine and wagon parts and material. It was found that the productivity\r\nof labor in loading and unloading shown on this occasion was about 270\r\nper cent. of the normal, and a similar superiority of effort was shown\r\nin the other kinds of work. This example was immediately copied on other\r\nrailways. The Alexandrovsk railway had its first \"Saturdaying\" on May\r\n17th. Ninety-eight persons worked for five hours, and here also did\r\ntwo or three times as much is the usual amount of work done in the\r\nsame number of working hours under ordinary circumstances. One of the\r\nworkmen, in giving an account of the performance, wrote: \"The Comrades\r\nexplain this by saying that in ordinary times the work was dull and they\r\nwere sick of it, whereas this occasion they were working willingly and\r\nwith excitement. But now it will be shameful in ordinary hours to do\r\nless than in the Communist 'Saturdaying.'\" The hope implied in this last\r\nsentence has not been realized.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Pravda of June 7th there is an article describing one of these early\r\n\"Saturdayings,\" which gives a clear picture of the infectious character\r\nof the proceedings, telling how people who came out of curiosity to\r\nlook on found themselves joining in the work, and how a soldier with an\r\naccordion after staring for a long time open-mouthed at these\r\nlunatics working on a Saturday afternoon put up a tune for them on his\r\ninstrument, and, delighted by their delight, played on while the workers\r\nall sang together.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe idea of the \"Saturdayings\" spread quickly from railways to\r\nfactories, and by the middle of the summer reports of similar efforts\r\nwere coming from all over Russia. Then Lenin became interested, seeing\r\nin these \"Saturdayings\" not only a special effort in the face of common\r\ndanger, but an actual beginning of Communism and a sign that Socialism\r\ncould bring about a greater productivity of labor than could be obtained\r\nunder Capitalism. He wrote: \"This is a work of great difficulty and\r\nrequiring much time, but it has begun, and that is the main thing. If\r\nin hungry Moscow in the summer of 1919 hungry workmen who have lived\r\nthrough the difficult four years of the Imperialistic war, and then the\r\nyear and a half of the still more difficult civil war, have been able to\r\nbegin this great work, what will not be its further development when we\r\nconquer in the civil war and win peace.\" He sees in it a promise of\r\nwork being done not for the sake of individual gain, but because of a\r\nrecognition that such work is necessary for the general good, and in all\r\nhe wrote and spoke about it he emphasized the fact that people worked\r\nbetter and harder when working thus than under any of the conditions\r\n(piece-work, premiums for good work, etc.) imposed by the revolution\r\nin its desperate attempts to raise the productivity of labor. For this\r\nreason alone, he wrote, the first \"Saturdaying\" on the Moscow-Kazan\r\nrailway was an event of historical significance, and not for Russia\r\nalone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhether Lenin was right or wrong in so thinking, \"Saturdayings\" became a\r\nregular institution, like Dorcas meetings in Victorian England, like the\r\nthousands of collective working parties instituted in England during the\r\nwar with Germany. It remains to be seen how long they will continue,\r\nand if they will survive peace when that comes. At present the most\r\ninteresting point about them is the large proportion of non-Communists\r\nwho take an enthusiastic part in them. In many cases not more than ten\r\nper cent. of Communists are concerned, though they take the initiative in\r\norganizing the parties and in finding the work to be done. The movement\r\nspread like fire in dry grass, like the craze for roller-skating swept\r\nover England some years ago, and efforts were made to control it, so\r\nthat the fullest use might be made of it. In Moscow it was found\r\nworth while to set up a special Bureau for \"Saturdayings.\" Hospitals,\r\nrailways, factories, or any other concerns working for the public good,\r\nnotify this bureau that they need the sort of work a \"Saturdaying\"\r\nprovides. The bureau informs the local Communists where their services\r\nare required, and thus there is a minimum of wasted energy. The local\r\nCommunists arrange the \"Saturdayings,\" and any one else joins in who\r\nwants. These \"Saturdayings\" are a hardship to none because they are\r\nvoluntary, except for members of the Communist Party, who are considered\r\nto have broken the party discipline if they refrain. But they can avoid\r\nthe \"Saturdayings\" if they wish to by leaving the party. Indeed, Lenin\r\npoints, out that the \"Saturdayings\" are likely to assist in clearing out\r\nof the party those elements which joined it with the hope of personal\r\ngain. He points out that the privileges of a Communists now consist in\r\ndoing more work than other people in the rear, and, on the front, in\r\nhaving the certainty of being killed when other folk are merely taken\r\nprisoners.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following are a few examples of the sort of work done in the\r\n\"Saturdayings.\" Briansk hospitals were improperly heated because of\r\nlack of the local transport necessary to bring them wood. The Communists\r\norganized a \"Saturdaying,\" in which 900 persons took part, including\r\nmilitary specialists (officers of the old army serving in the new),\r\nsoldiers, a chief of staff, workmen and women. Having no horses, they\r\nharnessed themselves to sledges in groups of ten, and brought in the\r\nwood required. At Nijni 800 persons spent their Saturday afternoon in\r\nunloading barges. In the Basman district of Moscow there was a gigantic\r\n\"Saturdaying\" and \"Sundaying\" in which 2,000 persons (in this case all\r\nbut a little over 500 being Communists) worked in the heavy artillery\r\nshops, shifting materials, cleaning tramlines for bringing in fuel, etc.\r\nThen there was a \"Saturdaying\" the main object of which was a\r\ngeneral autumn cleaning of the hospitals for the wounded. One form of\r\n\"Saturdaying\" for women is going to the hospitals, talking with the\r\nwounded and writing letters for them, mending their clothes, washing\r\nsheets, etc. The majority of \"Saturdayings\" at present are concerned\r\nwith transport work and with getting and shifting wood, because at\r\nthe moment these are the chief difficulties. I have talked to many\r\n\"Saturdayers,\" Communist and non-Communist, and all alike spoke of these\r\nSaturday afternoons of as kind of picnic. On the other hand, I have met\r\nCommunists who were accustomed to use every kind off ingenuity to find\r\nexcuses not to take part in them and yet to preserve the good opinion of\r\ntheir local committee.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut even if the whole of the Communist Party did actually indulge in\r\na working picnic once a week, it would not suffice to meet Russia's\r\ntremendous needs. And, as I pointed out in the chapter specially devoted\r\nto the shortage of labor, the most serious need at present is to keep\r\nskilled workers at their jobs instead of letting them drift away into\r\nnon-productive labor. No amount of Saturday picnics could do that, and\r\nit was obvious long ago that some other means, would have to be devised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDUSTRIAL CONSCRIPTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe general principle of industrial conscription recognized by the\r\nRussian Constitution, section ii, chapter v, paragraph 18, which reads:\r\n\"The Russian Socialist Federate Soviet Republic recognizes that work is\r\nan obligation on every citizen of the Republic,\" and proclaims, \"He who\r\ndoes not work shall not eat.\" It is, however, one thing to proclaim such\r\na principle and quite another to put it into action.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn December 17, 1919, the moment it became clear that there was a real\r\npossibility that the civil war was drawing to an end, Trotsky allowed\r\nthe Pravda to print a memorandum of his, consisting of \"theses\" or\r\nreasoned notes about industrial conscription and the militia system.\r\nHe points out that a Socialist State demands a general plan for the\r\nutilization of all the resources of a country, including its human\r\nenergy. At the same time, \"in the present economic chaos in which are\r\nmingled the broken fragments of the past and the beginnings of the\r\nfuture,\" a sudden jump to a complete centralized economy of the country\r\nas a whole is impossible. Local initiative, local effort must not\r\nbe sacrificed for the sake of a plan. At the same time industrial\r\nconscription is necessary for complete socialization. It cannot be\r\nregardless of individuality like military conscription. He suggests a\r\nsubdivision of the State into territorial productive districts which\r\nshould coincide with the territorial districts of the militia system\r\nwhich shall replace the regular army. Registration of labor necessary.\r\nNecessary also to coordinate military and industrial registration. At\r\ndemobilization the cadres of regiments, divisions, etc., should form\r\nthe fundamental cadres of the militia. Instruction to this end should\r\nbe included in the courses for workers and peasants who are training to\r\nbecome officers in every district. Transition to the militia system must\r\nbe carefully and gradually accomplished so as not for a moment to leave\r\nthe Republic defenseless. While not losing sight of these ultimate aims,\r\nit is necessary to decide on immediate needs and to ascertain exactly\r\nwhat amount of labor is necessary for their limited realization. He\r\nsuggests the registration of skilled labor in the army. He suggests that\r\na Commission under general direction of the Council of Public Economy\r\nshould work out a preliminary plan and then hand it over to the War\r\nDepartment, so that means should be worked out for using the military\r\napparatus for this new industrial purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nTrotsky's twenty-four theses or notes must have been written in odd\r\nmoments, now here now there, on the way from one front to another. They\r\ndo not form a connected whole. Contradictions jostle each other, and\r\nit is quite clear that Trotsky himself had no very definite plan in his\r\nhead. But his notes annoyed and stimulated so many other people that\r\nthey did perhaps precisely the work they were intended to do. Pravada\r\nprinted them with a note from the editor inviting discussion. The\r\nEkonomitcheskaya Jizn printed letter after letter from workmen,\r\nofficials and others, attacking, approving and bringing new suggestions.\r\nLarin, Semashko, Pyatakov, Bucharin all took a hand in the discussion.\r\nLarin saw in the proposals the beginning of the end of the revolution,\r\nbeing convinced that authority would pass from the democracy of the\r\nworkers into the hands of the specialists. Rykov fell upon them with\r\nsturdy blows on behalf of the Trades Unions. All, however, agreed on the\r\none point--that something of the sort was necessary. On December 27th\r\na Commission for studying the question of industrial conscription was\r\nformed under the presidency of Trotsky. This Commission included the\r\nPeople's Commissars, or Ministers, of Labor, Ways of Communication,\r\nSupply, Agriculture, War, and the Presidents of the Central Council of\r\nthe Trades Unions and of the Supreme Council of Public Economy. They\r\ncompiled a list of the principal questions before them, and invited\r\nanybody interested to bring them suggestions and material for\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the discussion was not limited to the newspapers or to this\r\nCommission. The question was discussed in Soviets and Conferences of\r\nevery kind all over the country. Thus, on January 1st an All-Russian\r\nConference of local \"departments for the registration and distribution\r\nof labor,\" after prolonged argument, contributed their views. They\r\npointed out (1) the need of bringing to work numbers of persons who\r\ninstead of doing the skilled labor for which they were qualified were\r\nengaged in petty profiteering, etc.; (2) that there evaporation of\r\nskilled labor into unproductive speculation could at least be checked\r\nby the introduction of labor books, which would give some sort of\r\nregistration of each citizen's work; (3) that workmen can be brought\r\nback from the villages only for enterprises which are supplied with\r\nprovisions or are situated in districts where there is plenty. (\"The\r\nopinion that, in the absence of these preliminary conditions, it will be\r\npossible to draw workmen from the villages by measures of compulsion or\r\nmobilization is profoundly mistaken.\") (4) that there should be a census\r\nof labor and that the Trades Unions should be invited to protect the\r\ninterests of the conscripted. Finally, this Conference approved the idea\r\nof using the already existing military organization for carrying out a\r\nlabor census of the Red Army, and for the turning over to labor of parts\r\nof the army during demobilization, but opposed the idea of giving the\r\nmilitary organization the work of labor registration and industrial\r\nconscription in general.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn January 22, 1920, the Central Committee of the Communist Party, after\r\nprolonged discussion of Trotsky's rough memorandum, finally adopted\r\nand published a new edition of the \"theses,\" expanded, altered, almost\r\nunrecognizable, a reasoned body of theory entirely different from\r\nthe bundle of arrows loosed at a venture by Trotsky. They definitely\r\naccepted the principle of industrial conscription, pointing out the\r\nimmediate reasons for it in the fact that Russia cannot look for much\r\nhelp from without and must somehow or other help herself.\r\n\r\n\r\nLong before the All-Russian Congress of the Communist Party approved the\r\ntheses of the Committee, one form of industrial conscription was already\r\nbeing tested at work. Very early in January, when the discussion on the\r\nsubject was at its height, the Soviet of the Third Army addressed itself\r\nto the Council of Defense of the Republic with an invitation to make use\r\nof this army (which at least for the moment had finished its military\r\ntask) and to experiment with it as a labor army. The Council of Defense\r\nagreed. Representatives of the Commissariats of Supply, Agriculture,\r\nWays and Communications, Labor and the Supreme Council of Public Economy\r\nwere sent to assist the Army Soviet. The army was proudly re-named \"The\r\nFirst Revolutionary Army of Labor,\" and began to issue communiques\r\n\"from the Labor front,\" precisely like the communiques of an army in the\r\nfield. I translate as a curiosity the first communique issued by a Labor\r\nArmy's Soviet:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Wood prepared in the districts of Ishim, Karatulskaya, Omutinskaya,\r\nZavodoutovskaya, Yalutorovska, Iushaly, Kamuishlovo, Turinsk, Altynai,\r\nOshtchenkovo, Shadrinsk, 10,180 cubic sazhins. Working days, 52,651.\r\nTaken to the railway stations, 5,334 cubic sazhins. Working days on\r\ntransport, 22,840. One hundred carpenters detailed for the Kizelovsk\r\nmines. One hundred carpenters detailed for the bridge at Ufa. One\r\nengineer specialist detailed to the Government Council of Public Economy\r\nfor repairing the mills of Chelyabinsk Government. One instructor\r\naccountant detailed for auditing the accounts of the economic\r\norganizations of Kamuishlov. Repair of locomotives proceeding in the\r\nworks at Ekaterinburg. January 20, 1920, midnight.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Labor Army's Soviet received a report on the state of the district\r\ncovered by the army with regard to supply and needed work. By the end of\r\nJanuary it had already carried out a labor census of the army, and found\r\nthat it included over 50,000 laborers, of whom a considerable number\r\nwere skilled. It decided on a general plan of work in reestablishing\r\nindustry in the Urals, which suffered severely during the Kolchak regime\r\nand the ebb and flow of the civil war, and was considering a suggestion\r\nof one of its members that if the scheme worked well the army should be\r\nincreased to 300,000 men by way of mobilization.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn January 23rd the Council of Defense of the Republic, encouraged\r\nto proceed further, decided to make use of the Reserve Army for the\r\nimprovement of railway transport on the Moscow-Kazan railway, one of\r\nthe chief arteries between eastern food districts and Moscow. The main\r\nobject is to be the reestablishment of through traffic between Moscow\r\nand Ekaterinburg and the repair of the Kazan-Ekaterinburg line, which\r\nparticularly suffered during the war. An attempt was to be made to\r\nrebuild the bridge over the Kama River before the ice melts. The\r\nCommander of the Reserve Army was appointed Commissar of the eastern\r\npart of the Moscow-Kazan railway, retaining his position as Commander\r\nof the Army. With a view of coordination between the Army Soviet and the\r\nrailway authorities, a member of the Soviet was also appointed Commissar\r\nof the railway. On January 25th it was announced that a similar\r\nexperiment was being made in the Ukraine. A month before the ice broke\r\nthe first train actually crossed the Kama River by the rebuilt bridge.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy April of this year the organization of industrial conscription had\r\ngone far beyond the original labor armies. A decree of February 5th had\r\ncreated a Chief Labor Committee, consisting of five members, Serebryakov\r\nand Danilov, from the Commissariat of War; Vasiliev, from the\r\nCommissariat of the Interior; Anikst, from the Commissariat of Labor;\r\nDzerzhinsky, from the Commissariat of Internal Affairs. Dzerzhinsky was\r\nPresident, and his appointment was possibly made in the hope that the\r\nreputation he had won as President of the Extraordinary Committee for\r\nFighting Counter-Revolution would frighten people into taking this\r\nCommittee seriously. Throughout the country in each government or\r\nprovince similar committees, called \"Troikas,\" were created, each of\r\nthree members, one from the Commissariat of War, one from the Department\r\nof Labor, one from the Department of Management, in each case from\r\nthe local Commissariats and Departments attached to the local Soviet.\r\nRepresentatives of the Central Statistical Office and its local organs\r\nhad a right to be present at the meeting of these committees of three,\r\nor \"Troikas,\" but had not the right to vote. An organization or a\r\nfactory requiring labor, was to apply to the Labor Department of the\r\nlocal Soviet. This Department was supposed to do its best to satisfy\r\ndemands upon it by voluntary methods first. If these proved insufficient\r\nthey were to apply to the local \"Troika,\" or Labor Conscription\r\nCommittee. If this found that its resources also were insufficient, it\r\nwas to refer back the request to the Labor Department of the Soviet,\r\nwhich was then to apply to its corresponding Department in the\r\nGovernment Soviet, which again, first voluntarily and then through the\r\nGovernment Committee of Labor Conscription, was to try to satisfy the\r\ndemands. I fancy the object of this arrangement was to prevent local\r\n\"Troikas\" from referring to Government \"Troikas,\" and so directly to\r\nDzerzhinsky's Central Committee. If they had been able to do this there\r\nwould obviously have been danger lest a new network of independent and\r\npowerful organizations should be formed. Experience with the overgrown\r\nand insuppressible Committees for Fighting Counter-Revolution had taught\r\npeople how serious such a development might be.\r\n\r\nSuch was the main outline of the scheme for conscripting labor. A\r\nsimilar scheme was prepared for superintending and safeguarding labor\r\nwhen conscripted. In every factory of over 1,000 workmen, clerks, etc.,\r\nthere was formed a Commission (to distinguish it from the Committee) of\r\nIndustrial Conscription. Smaller factories shared such Commissions\r\nor were joined for the purpose to larger factories near by. These\r\nCommissions were to be under the direct control of a Factory Committee,\r\nthereby preventing squabbles between conscripted and non-conscripted\r\nlabor. They were to be elected for six months, but their members could\r\nbe withdrawn and replaced by the Factory Committee with the approval of\r\nthe local \"Troika.\" These Commissions, like the \"Troikas,\" consisted\r\nof three members: (1) from the management of the factory, (2) from the\r\nFactory Committee, (3) from the Executive Committee of the workers. (It\r\nwas suggested in the directions that one of these should be from the\r\ngroup which \"has been organizing 'Saturdayings,' that is to say that he\r\nor she should be a Communist.) The payment of conscripted workers was\r\nto be by production, with prizes for specially good work. Specially bad\r\nwork was also foreseen in the detailed scheme of possible punishments.\r\nOffenders were to be brought before the \"People's Court\" (equivalent\r\nto the ordinary Civil Court), or, in the case of repeated or very bad\r\noffenses, were to be brought before the far more dreaded Revolutionary\r\nTribunals. Six categories of possible offenses were placed upon the new\r\ncode:\r\n\r\n\r\n     (1)Avoiding registration, absenteeism, or desertion.\r\n     (2)The preparation of false documents or the use of such.\r\n     (3)Officials giving false information to facilitate these crimes.\r\n     (4)Purposeful damage of instruments or material.\r\n     (5)Uneconomical or careless work.\r\n     (6)(Probably the most serious of all: Instigation to any of\r\n     these actions.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"Troikas\" have the right to deal administratively with the less\r\nimportant crimes by deprival of freedom for not more than two weeks.\r\nNo one can be brought to trial except by the Committee for Industrial\r\nConscription on the initiative of the responsible director of work, and\r\nwith the approval either of the local labor inspection authorities or\r\nwith that of the local Executive Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo one with the slightest knowledge of Russia will suppose for a moment\r\nthat this elaborate mechanism sprang suddenly into existence when\r\nthe decree was signed. On the contrary, all stages of industrial\r\nconscription exist simultaneously even today, and it would be possible\r\nby going from one part of Russia to another to collect a series of\r\nspecimens of industrial conscription at every stage of evolution, just\r\nas one can collect all stages of man from a baboon to a company director\r\nor a Communist. Some of the more primitive kinds of conscription were\r\nnot among the least successful. For example, at the time (in the spring\r\nof the year) when the Russians still hoped that the Poles would be\r\ncontent with the huge area of non-Polish territory they had already\r\nseized, the army on the western front was without any elaborate system\r\nof decrees being turned into a labor army. The work done was at first\r\nordinary country work, mainly woodcutting. They tried to collaborate\r\nwith the local \"Troikas,\" sending help when these Committees asked\r\nfor it. This, however, proved unsatisfactory, so, disregarding the\r\n\"Troikas,\" they organized things for themselves in the whole area\r\nimmediately behind the front. They divided up the forests into definite\r\ndistricts, and they worked these with soldiers and with deserters.\r\nGradually their work developed, and they built themselves narrow-gauge\r\nrailways for the transport of the wood. Then they needed wagons and\r\nlocomotives, and of course immediately found themselves at loggerheads\r\nwith the railway authorities. Finally, they struck a bargain with\r\nthe railwaymen, and were allowed to take broken-down wagons which the\r\nrailway people were not in a position to mend. Using such skilled labor\r\nas they had, they mended such wagons as were given them, and later made\r\na practice of going to the railway yards and in inspecting \"sick\" wagons\r\nfor themselves, taking out any that they thought had a chance even\r\nof temporary convalescence. Incidentally they caused great scandal\r\nby finding in the Smolensk sidings among the locomotives and wagons\r\nsupposed to be sick six good locomotives and seventy perfectly healthy\r\nwagons. Then they began to improve the feeding of their army by sending\r\nthe wood they had cut, in the trains they had mended, to people who\r\nwanted wood and could give them provisions. One such train went to\r\nTurkestan and back from the army near Smolensk. Their work continually\r\nincreased, and since they had to remember that they were an army and\r\nnot merely a sort of nomadic factory, they began themselves to mobilize,\r\nexclusively for purposes of work, sections of the civil population.\r\nI asked Unshlicht, who had much to do with this organization, if the\r\npeasants came willingly. He said, \"Not very,\" but added that they did\r\nnot mind when they found that they got well fed and were given packets\r\nof salt as prizes for good work. \"The peasants,\" he said, \"do not\r\ngrumble against the Government when it shows the sort of common\r\nsense that they themselves can understand. We found that when we said\r\ndefinitely how many carts and men a village must provide, and used them\r\nwithout delay for a definite purpose, they were perfectly satisfied and\r\nconsidered it right and proper. In every case, however, when they saw\r\npeople being mobilized and sent thither without obvious purpose or\r\nresult, they became hostile at once.\" I asked Unshlicht how it was that\r\ntheir army still contained skilled workmen when one of the objects of\r\nindustrial conscription was to get the skilled workmen back into the\r\nfactories. He said: \"We have an accurate census of the army, and when we\r\nget asked for skilled workmen for such and such a factory, they go there\r\nknowing that they still belong to the army.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThat, of course, is the army point of view, and indicates one of the\r\nmain squabbles which industrial conscription has produced. Trotsky would\r\nlike the various armies to turn into units of a territorial militia, and\r\nat the same time to be an important part of the labor organization\r\nof each district. His opponents do not regard the labor armies as a\r\npermanent manifestation, and many have gone so far as to say that\r\nthe productivity of labor in one of these armies is lower than among\r\nordinary workmen. Both sides produce figures on this point, and Trotsky\r\ngoes so far as to say that if his opponents are right, then not only\r\nare labor armies damned, but also the whole principle of industrial\r\nconscription. \"If compulsory labor-independently of social condition-is\r\nunproductive, that is a condemnation not of the labor armies, but of\r\nindustrial conscription in general, and with it of the whole Soviet\r\nsystem, the further development of which is unthinkable except on a\r\nbasis of universal industrial conscription.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBut, of course, the question of the permanence of the labor armies is\r\nnot so important as the question of getting the skilled workers back\r\nto the factories. The comparative success or failure of soldiers or\r\nmobilized peasants in cutting wood is quite irrelevant to this recovery\r\nof the vanished workmen. And that recovery will take time, and will be\r\nentirely useless unless it is possible to feed these workers when they\r\nhave been collected. There have already been several attempts, not\r\nwholly successful, to collect the straying workers of particular\r\nindustries. Thus, after the freeing of the oil-wells from the Whites,\r\nthere was a general mobilization of naphtha workers. Many of these had\r\nbolted on or after the arrival of Krasnov or Denikin and gone far into\r\nCentral Russia, settling where they could. So months passed before the\r\nRed Army definitely pushed the area of civil war beyond the oil-wells,\r\nthat many of these refugees had taken new root and were unwilling to\r\nreturn. I believe, that in spite of the mobilization, the oil-wells\r\nare still short of men. In the coal districts also, which have passed\r\nthrough similar experiences, the proportion of skilled to unskilled\r\nlabor is very much smaller than it was before the war. There have also\r\nbeen two mobilizations of railway workers, and these, I think, may be\r\npartly responsible for the undoubted improvement noticeable during\r\nthe year, although this is partly at least due to other things beside\r\nconscription. In the first place Trotsky carried with him into the\r\nCommissariat of Transport the same ferocious energy that he has shown in\r\nthe Commissariat of War, together with the prestige that he had gained\r\nthere. Further, he was well able in the councils of the Republic to\r\ndefend the needs of his particular Commissariat against those of all\r\nothers. He was, for example able to persuade the Communist Party to\r\ntreat the transport crisis precisely as they had treated each crisis\r\non the front-that is to say, to mobilize great numbers of professed\r\nCommunists to meet it, giving them in this case the especial task of\r\ngetting engines mended and, somehow or other, of keeping trains on the\r\nmove.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut neither the bridges mended and the wood cut by the labor armies,\r\nnor the improvement in transport, are any final proof of the success of\r\nindustrial conscription. Industrial conscription in the proper sense\r\nof the words is impossible until a Government knows what it has to\r\nconscript. A beginning was made early this year by the introduction of\r\nlabor books, showing what work people were doing and where, and serving\r\nas a kind of industrial passports. But in April this year these had not\r\nyet become general in Moscow although the less unwieldy population of\r\nPetrograd was already supplied with them. It will be long even if it is\r\npossible at all, before any considerable proportion of the people not\r\nliving in these two cities are registered in this way. A more useful\r\nstep was taken at the end of August, in a general census throughout\r\nRussia. There has been no Russian census since 1897. There was to have\r\nbeen another about the time the war began. It was postponed for obvious\r\nreasons. If the Communists carry through the census with even moderate\r\nsuccess (they will of course have to meet every kind of evasion), they\r\nwill at least get some of the information without which industrial\r\nconscription on a national scale must be little more than a farce.\r\nThe census should show them where the skilled workers are. Industrial\r\nconscription should enable them to collect them and put them at their\r\nown skilled work. Then if, besides transplanting them, they are able to\r\nfeed them, it will be possible to judge of the success or failure of a\r\nscheme which in most countries would bring a Government toppling to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"In most countries\"; yes, but then the economic crisis has gone\r\nfurther in Russia than in most countries. There is talk of introducing\r\nindustrial conscription (one year's service) in Germany, where things\r\nhave not gone nearly so far. And perhaps industrial conscription, like\r\nCommunism itself, becomes a thing of desperate hope only in a country\r\nactually face to face with ruin. I remember saying to Trotsky, when\r\ntalking of possible opposition, that I, as an Englishman, with the\r\ntendencies to practical anarchism belonging to my race, should certainly\r\nobject most strongly if I were mobilized and set to work in a particular\r\nfactory, and might even want to work in some other factory just for the\r\nsake of not doing what I was forced to do. Trotsky replied: \"You would\r\nnow. But you would not if you had been through a revolution, and seen\r\nyour country in such a state that only the united, concentrated effort\r\nof everybody could possibly reestablish it. That is the position here.\r\nEverybody knows the position and that there is no other way.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT THE COMMUNISTS ARE TRYING TO DO IN RUSSIA\r\n\r\n\r\nWe come now to the Communist plans for reconstruction. We have seen, in\r\nthe first two chapters, something of the appalling paralysis which is\r\nthe most striking factor in the economic problem to-day. We have seen\r\nhow Russia is suffering from a lack of things and from a lack of labor,\r\nhow these two shortages react on each other, and how nothing but a vast\r\nimprovement in transport can again set in motion what was one of the\r\ngreat food-producing machines of the world. We have also seen something\r\nof the political organization which, with far wider ambitions before\r\nit, is at present struggling to prevent temporary paralysis from turning\r\ninto permanent atrophy. We have seen that it consists of a political\r\nparty so far dominant that the Trades Unions and all that is articulate\r\nin the country may be considered as part of a machinery of propaganda,\r\nfor getting those things done which that political party considers\r\nshould be done. In a country fighting, literally, for its life, no man\r\ncan call his soul his own, and we have seen how this fact-a fact that\r\nhas become obvious again and again in the history of the world, whenever\r\na nation has had its back to the wall-is expressed in Russia in terms\r\nof industrial conscription; in measures, that is to say, which would be\r\nimpossible in any country not reduced to such extremities; in measures\r\nwhich may prove to be the inevitable accompaniment of national crisis,\r\nwhen such crisis is economic rather than military. Let us now see what\r\nthe Russians, with that machinery at their disposal are trying to do.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that since this machinery is dominated by a political\r\nparty, it will be impossible to understand the Russian plans, without\r\nunderstanding that particular political party's estimate of the\r\nsituation in general. It is obvious that the Communist plans for Russia\r\nmust be largely affected by their view of Europe as a whole. This view\r\nis gloomy in the extreme. The Communists believe that Europe is steadily\r\nshaking itself to pieces. They believe that this process has already\r\ngone so far that, even given good will on the part of European\r\nGovernments, the manufacturers of Western countries are already\r\nincapable of supplying them with all the things which Russia was\r\nimporting before the war, still less make up the enormous arrears which\r\nhave resulted from six years of blockade. They do not agree with M.\r\nClemenceau that \"revolution is a disease attacking defeated countries\r\nonly.\" Or, to put it as I have heard it stated in Moscow, they believe\r\nthat President Wilson's aspiration towards a peace in which should be\r\nneither conqueror nor conquered has been at least partially realized in\r\nthe sense that every country ended the struggle economically defeated,\r\nwith the possible exception of America, whose signature, after all, is\r\nstill to be ratified. They believe that even in seemingly prosperous\r\ncountries the seeds of economic disaster are already fertilized. They\r\nthink that the demands of labor will become greater and more difficult\r\nto fulfill until at last they become incompatible with a continuance of\r\nthe capitalist system. They think that strike after strike, irrespective\r\nof whether it is successful or not, will gradually widen the cracks\r\nand flaws already apparent in the damaged economic structure of Western\r\nEurope. They believe that conflicting interests will involve our nations\r\nin new national wars, and that each of these will deepen the cleavage\r\nbetween capital and labor. They think that even if exhaustion makes\r\nmutual warfare on a large scale impossible, these conflicting interests\r\nwill produce such economic conflicts, such refusals of cooperation, as\r\nwill turn exhaustion to despair. They believe, to put it briefly, that\r\nRussia has passed through the worst stages of a process to which\r\nevery country in Europe will be submitted in turn by its desperate and\r\nembittered inhabitants. We may disagree with them, but we shall not\r\nunderstand them if we refuse to take that belief into account. If, as\r\nthey imagine, the next five years are to be years of disturbance and\r\ngrowing resolution, Russia will get very little from abroad. If, for\r\nexample, there is to be a serious struggle in England, Russia will get\r\npractically nothing. They not only believe that these things are\r\ngoing to be, but make the logical deductions as to the effect of such\r\ndisturbances on their own chances of importing what they need. For\r\nexample, Lenin said to me that \"the shock of revolution in England would\r\nensure the final defeat of capitalism,\" but he said at the same time\r\nthat it would be felt at once throughout the world and cause such\r\nreverberations as would paralyze industry everywhere. And that is why,\r\nalthough Russia is an agricultural country, the Communist plans for her\r\nreconstruction are concerned first of all not with agriculture, but with\r\nindustry. In their schemes for the future of the world, Russia's part is\r\nthat of a gigantic farm, but in their schemes for the immediate future\r\nof Russia, their eyes are fixed continually on the nearer object of\r\nmaking her so far self-supporting that, even if Western Europe is\r\nunable to help them, they may be able to crawl out of their economic\r\ndifficulties, as Krassin put it to me before he left Moscow, \"if\r\nnecessary on all fours, but somehow or other, crawl out.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSome idea of the larger ambitions of the Communists with regard to the\r\ndevelopment of Russia are given in a conversation with Rykov, which\r\nfollows this chapter. The most important characteristic of them is that\r\nthey are ambitions which cannot but find an echo in Russians of any\r\nkind, quite regardless of their political convictions. The old anomalies\r\nof Russian industry, for example, the distances of the industrial\r\ndistricts from their sources of fuel and raw material are to be done\r\naway with. These anomalies were largely due to historical accidents,\r\nsuch as the caprice of Peter the Great, and not to any economic reasons.\r\nThe revolution, destructive as it has been, has at least cleaned the\r\nslate and made it possible, if it is possible to rebuild at all, to\r\nrebuild Russia on foundations laid by common sense. It may be said\r\nthat the Communists are merely doing flamboyantly and with a lot of\r\nflag-waving, what any other Russian Government would be doing in their\r\nplace. And without the flamboyance and the flag-waving, it is doubtful\r\nwhether in an exhausted country, it would be possible to get anything\r\ndone at all. The result of this is that in their work of economic\r\nreconstruction the Communists get the support of most of the best\r\nengineers and other technicians in the country, men who take no interest\r\nwhatsoever in the ideas of Karl Marx, but have a professional interest\r\nin doing the best they can with their knowledge, and a patriotic\r\nsatisfaction in using that knowledge for Russia. These men, caring not\r\nat all about Communism, want to make Russia once more a comfortably\r\nhabitable place, no matter under what Government. Their attitude is\r\nprecisely comparable to that of the officers of the old army who have\r\ncontributed so much to the success of the new. These officers were not\r\nCommunists, but they disliked civil war, and fought to put an end of it.\r\nAs Sergei Kamenev, the Commander-in-Chief, and not a Communist, said\r\nto me, \"I have not looked on the civil war as on a struggle between two\r\npolitical ideas, for the Whites have no definite idea. I have considered\r\nit simply as a struggle between the Russian Government and a number of\r\nmutineers.\" Precisely so do these \"bourgeois\" technicians now working\r\nthroughout Russia regard the task before them. It will be small\r\nsatisfaction to them if famine makes the position of any Government\r\nimpossible. For them the struggle is quite simply a struggle between\r\nRussia and the economic forces tending towards a complete collapse of\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Communists have thus practically the whole intelligence of the\r\ncountry to help them in their task of reconstruction, or of salvage.\r\nBut the educated classes alone cannot save a nation. Muscle is wanted\r\nbesides brain, and the great bulk of those who can provide muscle\r\nare difficult to move to enthusiasm by any broad schemes of economic\r\nrearrangement that do not promise immediate improvement in their own\r\nmaterial conditions. Industrial conscription cannot be enforced\r\nin Russia unless there is among the conscripted themselves an\r\nunderstanding, although a resentful understanding, of its necessity. The\r\nRussians have not got an army of Martians to enforce effort on an alien\r\npeople. The army and the people are one. \"We are bound to admit,\" says\r\nTrotsky, \"that no wide industrial mobilization will succeed, if we do\r\nnot capture all that is honorable, spiritual in the peasant working\r\nmasses in explaining our plan.\" And the plan that he referred to was\r\nnot the grandiose (but obviously sensible) plan for the eventual\r\nelectrification of all Russia, but a programme of the struggle before\r\nthem in actually getting their feet clear of the morass of industrial\r\ndecay in which they are at present involved. Such a programme has\r\nactually been decided upon-a programme the definite object of which\r\nis to reconcile the workers to work not simply hand to mouth, each for\r\nhimself, but to concentrate first on those labors which will eventually\r\nbring their reward in making other labors easier and improving the\r\nposition as a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly this year a comparatively unknown Bolshevik called Gusev, to whom\r\nnobody had attributed any particular intelligence, wrote, while busy on\r\nthe staff of an army on the southeast front, which was at the time being\r\nused partly as a labor army, a pamphlet which has had an extraordinary\r\ninfluence in getting such a programme drawn up. The pamphlet is based\r\non Gusev's personal observation both of a labor army at work and of\r\nthe attitude of the peasant towards industrial conscription. It was\r\nextremely frank, and contained so much that might have been used by\r\nhostile critics, that it was not published in the ordinary way but\r\nprinted at the army press on the Caucasian front and issued exclusively\r\nto members of the Communist Party. I got hold of a copy of this\r\npamphlet through a friend. It is called \"Urgent Questions of Economic\r\nConstruction.\" Gusev sets out in detail the sort of opposition he had\r\nmet, and says: \"The Anarchists, Social Revolutionaries and Mensheviks\r\nhave a clear, simple economic plan which the great masses can\r\nunderstand: 'Go about your own business and work freely for yourself in\r\nyour own place.' They have a criticism of labor mobilizations equally\r\nclear for the masses. They say to them, 'They are putting Simeon in\r\nPeter's place, and Peter in Simeon's. They are sending the men of\r\nSaratov to dig the ground in the Government of Stavropol, and the\r\nStavropol men to the Saratov Government for the same purpose.' Then\r\nbesides that there is 'nonparty' criticism:\r\n\r\n\"'When it is time to sow they will be shifting muck, and when it is time\r\nto reap they will be told to cut timber.' That is a particularly clear\r\nexpression of the peasants' disbelief in our ability to draw up a proper\r\neconomic plan. This belief is clearly at the bottom of such questions\r\nas, 'Comrade Gusev, have you ever done any plowing?' or 'Comrade Orator,\r\ndo you know anything about peasant work?' Disbelief in the townsman who\r\nunderstands nothing about peasants is natural to the peasant, and we\r\nshall have to conquer it, to get through it, to get rid of it by showing\r\nthe peasant, with a clear plan in our hands that he can understand, that\r\nwe are not altogether fools in this matter and that we understand more\r\nthan he does.\" He then sets out the argument which he himself had found\r\nsuccessful in persuading the peasants to do things the reward for which\r\nwould not be obvious the moment they were done. He says, \"I compared our\r\nState economy to a colossal building with scores of stories and tens of\r\nthousands of rooms. The whole building has been half smashed; in places\r\nthe roof has tumbled down, the beams have rotted, the ceilings are\r\ntumbling, the drains and water pipes are burst; the stoves are falling\r\nto pieces, the partitions are shattered, and, finally, the walls\r\nand foundations are unsafe and the whole building is threatened with\r\ncollapse. I asked, how, must one set about the repair of this building?\r\nWith what kind of economic plan? To this question the inhabitants of\r\ndifferent stories, and even of different rooms on one and the same story\r\nwill reply variously. Those who live on the top floor will shout that\r\nthe rafters are rotten and the roof falling; that it is impossible to\r\nlive, there any longer, and that it is immediately necessary, first of\r\nall, to put up new beams and to repair the roof. And from their point of\r\nview they will be perfectly right. Certainly it is not possible to live\r\nany longer on that floor. Certainly the repair of the roof is necessary.\r\nThe inhabitants of one of the lower stories in which the water pipes\r\nhave burst will cry out that it is impossible to live without water, and\r\ntherefore, first of all, the water pipes must be mended. And they, from\r\ntheir point of view, will be perfectly right, since it certainly is\r\nimpossible to live without water. The inhabitants of the floor where the\r\nstoves have fallen to pieces will insist on an immediate mending of the\r\nstoves, since they and their children are dying of cold because there is\r\nnothing on which they can heat up water or boil kasha for the children;\r\nand they, too, will be quite right. But in spite of all these just\r\ndemands, which arrive in thousands from all sides, it is impossible to\r\nforget the most important of all, that the foundation is shattered and\r\nthat the building is threatened with a collapse which will bury all\r\nthe inhabitants of the house together, and that, therefore, the only\r\nimmediate task is the strengthening of the foundation and the walls.\r\nExtraordinary firmness, extraordinary courage is necessary, not only not\r\nto listen to the cries and groans of old men, women, children and\r\nsick, coming from every floor, but also to decide on taking from the\r\ninhabitants of all floors the instruments and materials necessary for\r\nthe strengthening of the foundations and walls, and to force them to\r\nleave their corners and hearths, which they are doing the best they can\r\nto make habitable, in order to drive them to work on the strengthening\r\nof the walls and foundations.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGusev's main idea was that the Communists were asking new sacrifices\r\nfrom a weary and exhausted people, that without such sacrifices these\r\npeople would presently find themselves in even worse conditions, and\r\nthat, to persuade them to make the effort necessary to save themselves,\r\nit was necessary to have a perfectly clear and easily understandable\r\nplan which could be dinned into the whole nation and silence the\r\ncriticism of all possible opponents. Copies of his little book came to\r\nMoscow. Lenin read it and caused excruciating jealousy in the minds\r\nof several other Communists, who had also been trying to find the\r\nphilosopher's stone that should turn discouragement into hope, by\r\nsingling out Gusev for his special praise and insisting that his plans\r\nshould be fully discussed at the Supreme Council in the Kremlin. Trotsky\r\nfollowed Lenin's lead, and in the end a general programme for Russian\r\nreconstruction was drawn up, differing only slightly from that which\r\nGusev had proposed. I give this scheme in Trotsky's words, because they\r\nare a little fuller than those of others, and knowledge of this plan\r\nwill explain not only what the Communists are trying to do in Russia,\r\nbut what they would like to get from us today and what they will want to\r\nget tomorrow. Trotsky says:--\r\n\r\n\"The fundamental task at this moment is improvement in the condition of\r\nour transport, prevention of its further deterioration and preparation\r\nof the most elementary stores of food, raw material and fuel. The whole\r\nof the first period of our reconstruction will be completely occupied in\r\nthe concentration of labor on the solution of these problems, which is a\r\ncondition of further progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The second period (it will be difficult to say now whether it will\r\nbe measured in months or years, since that depends on many factors\r\nbeginning with the international situation and ending with the unanimity\r\nor the lack of it in our own party) will be a period occupied in the\r\nbuilding of machines in the interest of transport, and the getting of\r\nraw materials and provisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The third period will be occupied in building machinery, with a view to\r\nthe production of articles in general demand, and, finally, the fourth\r\nperiod will be that in which we are able to produce these articles.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDoes it not occur, even to the most casual reader, that there is very\r\nlittle politics in that program, and that, no matter what kind of\r\nGovernment should be in Russia, it would have to endorse that programme\r\nword for word? I would ask any who doubt this to turn again to my first\r\ntwo chapters describing the nature of the economic crisis in Russia, and\r\nto remind themselves how, not only the lack of things but the lack of\r\nmen, is intimately connected with the lack of transport, which keeps\r\nlaborers ill fed, factories ill supplied with material, and in this way\r\nkeeps the towns incapable of supplying the needs of the country, with\r\nthe result that the country is most unwilling to supply the needs of\r\nthe town. No Russian Government unwilling to allow Russia to subside\r\ndefinitely to a lower level of civilization can do otherwise than to\r\nconcentrate upon the improvement of transport. Labor in Russia must be\r\nused first of all for that, in order to increase its own productivity.\r\nAnd, if purchase of help from abroad is to be allowed, Russia must\r\n\"control\" the outflow of her limited assets, so that, by healing\r\ntransport first of all, she may increase her power of making new assets.\r\nShe must spend in such a way as eventually to increase her power of\r\nspending. She must prevent the frittering away of her small purse on\r\nthings which, profitable to the vendor and doubtless desirable by the\r\npurchaser, satisfy only individual needs and do not raise the producing\r\npower of the community as a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRYKOV ON ECONOMIC PLANS AND ON THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY\r\n\r\n\r\nAlexei Rykov, the President of the Supreme Council of Public Economy, is\r\none of the hardest worked men in Russia, and the only time I was able to\r\nhave a long talk with him (although more than once he snatched moments\r\nto answer particular questions) was on a holiday, when the old Siberian\r\nHotel, now the offices of the Council, was deserted, and I walked\r\nthrough empty corridors until I found the President and his secretary at\r\nwork as usual.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter telling of the building of the new railway from Alexandrovsk\r\nGai to the Emba, the prospects of developing the oil industry in that\r\ndistrict, the relative values of those deposits and of those at Baku,\r\nand the possible decreasing significance of Baku in Russian industry\r\ngenerally, we passed to broader perspectives. I asked him what he\r\nthought of the relations between agriculture and industry in Russia, and\r\nsupposed that he did not imagine that Russia would ever become a great\r\nindustrial country. His answer was characteristic of the tremendous\r\nhopes that nerve these people in their almost impossible task, and I\r\nset it down as nearly as I can in his own words. For him, of course, the\r\neconomic problem was the first, and he spoke of it as the director of\r\na huge trust might have spoken. But, as he passed on to talk of what he\r\nthought would result from the Communist method of tackling that problem,\r\nand spoke of the eventual disappearance of political parties, I felt I\r\nwas trying to read a kind of palimpsest of the Economist and\r\n\r\nNews from Nowhere, or listening to a strange compound of William Morris\r\nand, for example, Sir Eric Geddes. He said: \"We may have to wait a\r\nlong time before the inevitable arrives and there is a Supreme Economic\r\nCouncil dealing with Europe as with a single economic whole. If that\r\nshould come about we should, of course, from the very nature of our\r\ncountry, be called upon in the first place to provide food for Europe,\r\nand we should hope enormously to improve our agriculture, working on\r\na larger and larger scale, using mechanical plows and tractors, which\r\nwould be supplied us by the West. But in the meantime we have to face\r\nthe fact that events may cause us to be, for all practical purposes, in\r\na state of blockade for perhaps a score of years, and, so far as we\r\ncan, we must be ready to depend on ourselves alone. For example, we want\r\nmechanical plows which could be procured abroad. We have had to start\r\nmaking them ourselves. The first electric plow made in Russia and used\r\nin Russia started work last year, and this year we shall have a number\r\nof such plows made in our country, not because it is economic so to make\r\nthem, but because we could get them in no other way. In so far as is\r\npossible, we shall have to make ourselves self-supporting, so as\r\nsomehow or other to get along even if the blockade, formal or perhaps\r\nwilly-nilly (imposed by the inability of the West to supply us), compels\r\nus to postpone cooperation with the rest of Europe. Every day of such\r\npostponement is one in which the resources of Europe are not being used\r\nin the most efficient manner to supply the needs not only of our own\r\ncountry but of all.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI referred to what he had told me last year about the intended\r\nelectrification of Moscow by a station using turf fuel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"That,\" he said, \"is one of the plans which, in spite of the war, has\r\ngone a very long way towards completion. We have built the station in\r\nthe Ryezan Government, on the Shadul peat mosses, about 110 versts from\r\nMoscow. Before the end of May that station should be actually at work.\r\n(It was completed, opened and partially destroyed by a gigantic fire.)\r\nAnother station at Kashira in the Tula Government (on the Oka), using\r\nthe small coal produced in the Moscow coalfields, will be at work\r\nbefore the autumn. This year similar stations are being built at\r\nIvano-Voznesensk and at Nijni-Novgorod. Also, with a view to making the\r\nmost economic use of what we already possess, we have finished both\r\nin Petrograd and in Moscow a general unification of all the private\r\npower-stations, which now supply their current to a single main cable.\r\nSimilar unification is nearly finished at Tula and at Kostroma. The big\r\nwater-power station on the rapids of the Volkhov is finished in so far\r\nas land construction goes, but we can proceed no further until we have\r\nobtained the turbines, which we hope to get from abroad. As you know, we\r\nare basing our plans in general on the assumption that in course of time\r\nwe shall supply the whole of Russian industry with electricity, of which\r\nwe also hope to make great use in agriculture. That, of course, will\r\ntake a great number of years.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Nothing could have been much more artificial than the industrial\r\ngeography of old Russia. The caprice of history had planted great\r\nindustrial centers literally at the greatest possible distance from the\r\nsources of their raw materials. There was Moscow bringing its coal from\r\nDonetz, and Petrograd, still further away, having to eke out a living by\r\nimporting coal from England. The difficulty of transport alone must\r\nhave forced the Russians to consider how they could do away with such\r\nanomalies. Their main idea is that the transport of coal in a modern\r\nState is an almost inexcusable barbarism. They have set themselves,\r\nthese ragged engineers, working in rooms which they can hardly keep\r\nabove freezing-point and walking home through the snow in boots without\r\nsoles, no less a task than the electrification of the whole of Russia.\r\nThere is a State Committee presided over by an extraordinary optimist\r\ncalled Krzhizhanovsky, entrusted by the Supreme Council of Public\r\nEconomy and Commissariat of Agriculture with the working out of a\r\ngeneral plan. This Committee includes, besides a number of well-known\r\npractical engineers, Professors Latsinsky, Klassen, Dreier, Alexandrov,\r\nTcharnovsky, Dend and Pavlov. They are investigating the water power\r\navailable in different districts in Russia, the possibilities of using\r\nturf, and a dozen similar questions including, perhaps not the least\r\nimportant, investigation to discover where they can do most with least\r\ndependence on help from abroad.]\r\n\r\n\r\nConsidering the question of the import of machinery from abroad, I asked\r\nhim whether in existing conditions of transport Russia was actually in a\r\nposition to export the raw materials with which alone the Russians could\r\nhope to buy what they want. He said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Actually we have in hand about two million poods (a pood is a little\r\nover thirty-six English pounds) of flax, and any quantity of light\r\nleather (goat, etc.), but the main districts where we have raw material\r\nfor ourselves or for export are far away. Hides, for example, we have in\r\ngreat quantities in Siberia, in the districts of Orenburg and the Ural\r\nRiver and in Tashkent. I have myself made the suggestion that we should\r\noffer to sell this stuff where it is, that is to say not delivered at a\r\nseaport, and that the buyers should provide their own trains, which we\r\nshould eventually buy from them with the raw material itself, so that\r\nafter a certain number of journeys the trains should become ours. In\r\nthe same districts we have any quantity of wool, and in some of these\r\ndistricts corn. We cannot, in the present condition of our transport,\r\neven get this corn for ourselves. In the same way we have great\r\nquantities of rice in Turkestan, and actually are being offered rice\r\nfrom Sweden, because we cannot transport our own. Then we have over a\r\nmillion poods of copper, ready for export on the same conditions. But\r\nit is clear that if the Western countries are unable to help in the\r\ntransport, they cannot expect to get raw materials from us.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI asked about platinum. He laughed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"That is a different matter. In platinum we have a world monopoly, and\r\ncan consequently afford to wait. Diamonds and gold, they can have as\r\nmuch as they want of such rubbish; but platinum is different, and we\r\nare in no hurry to part with it. But diamonds and gold ornaments, the\r\njewelry of the Tsars, we are ready to give to any king in Europe who\r\nfancies them, if he can give us some less ornamental but more useful\r\nlocomotives instead.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI asked if Kolchak had damaged the platinum mines. He replied, \"Not at\r\nall. On the contrary, he was promising platinum to everybody who wanted\r\nit, and he set the mines going, so we arrived to find them in good\r\ncondition, with a considerable yield of platinum ready for use.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n(I am inclined to think that in spite of Rykov's rather intransigent\r\nattitude on the question, the Russians would none the less be willing to\r\nexport platinum, if only on account of the fact in comparison with its\r\ngreat value it requires little transport, and so would make possible for\r\nthem an immediate bargain with some of the machinery they most urgently\r\nneed.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally we talked of the growing importance of the Council of Public\r\nEconomy. Rykov was of opinion that it would eventually become the centre\r\nof the whole State organism, \"it and Trades Unions organizing the actual\r\nproducers in each branch.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Then you think that as your further plans develop, with the creation\r\nof more and more industrial centres, with special productive populations\r\nconcentrated round them, the Councils of the Trades Unions will tend to\r\nbecome identical with the Soviets elected in the same districts by the\r\nsame industrial units?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Precisely,\" said Rykov, \"and in that way the Soviets, useful during the\r\nperiod of transition as an instrument of struggle and dictatorship, will\r\nbe merged with the Unions.\" (One\r\n\r\nimportant factor, as Lenin pointed out when considering the same\r\nquestion, is here left out of count, namely the political development of\r\nthe enormous agricultural as opposed to industrial population.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\"But if this merging of political Soviets with productive Unions occurs,\r\nthe questions that concern people will cease to be political questions,\r\nbut will be purely questions of economics.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Certainly. And we shall see the disappearance of political parties.\r\nThat process is already apparent. In the present huge Trade Union\r\nConference there are only sixty Mensheviks. The Communists are\r\nswallowing one party after another. Those who were not drawn over to us\r\nduring the period of struggle are now joining us during the process of\r\nconstruction, and we find that our differences now are not political at\r\nall, but concerned only with the practical details of construction.\" He\r\nillustrated this by pointing out the present constitution of the Supreme\r\nCouncil of Public Economy. There are under it fifty-three Departments or\r\nCentres (Textile, Soap, Wool, Timber, Flax, etc.), each controlled by\r\na \"College\" of three or more persons. There are 232 members of these\r\nColleges or Boards in all, and of them 83 are workmen, 79 are\r\nengineers, 1 was an ex-director, 50 were from the clerical staff, and 19\r\nunclassified. Politically 115 were Communists, 105 were \"non-party,\" and\r\n12 were of non-Communist parties. He continued, \"Further, in swallowing\r\nthe other parties, the Communists themselves will cease to exist as a\r\npolitical party. Think only that youths coming to their manhood during\r\nthis year in Russia and in the future will not be able to confirm from\r\ntheir own experience the reasoning of Karl Marx, because they will have\r\nhad no experience of a capitalist country. What can they make of\r\nthe class struggle? The class struggle here is already over, and the\r\ndistinctions of class have already gone altogether. In the old days,\r\nmembers of our party were men who had read, or tried to read, Marx's\r\n\"Capital,\" who knew the \"Communist Manifesto\" by heart, and were\r\noccupied in continual criticism of the basis of capitalist society. Look\r\nat the new members of our party. Marx is quite unnecessary to them. They\r\njoin us, not for struggle in the interests of an oppressed class, but\r\nsimply because they understand our aims in constructive work. And, as\r\nthis process continues, we old social democrats shall disappear, and our\r\nplaces will be filled by people of entirely different character grown up\r\nunder entirely new conditions.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNON-PARTYISM\r\n\r\n\r\nRykov's prophecies of the disappearance of Political parties may be\r\nfalsified by a development of that very non-partyism on which he bases\r\nthem. It is true that the parties openly hostile to the Communists\r\nin Russia have practically disappeared. Many old-time Mensheviks have\r\njoined the Communist Party. Here and there in the country may be found\r\na Social Revolutionary stronghold. Here and there in the Ukraine the\r\nMensheviks retain a footing, but I doubt whether either of these parties\r\nhas in it the vitality to make itself once again a serious political\r\nfactor. There is, however, a movement which, in the long run, may alter\r\nRussia's political complexion. More and more delegates to Soviets\r\nor Congresses of all kinds are explicitly described as \"Non-party.\"\r\nNon-partyism is perhaps a sign of revolt against rigid discipline of\r\nany kind. Now and then, of course, a clever Menshevik or Social\r\nRevolutionary, by trimming his sails carefully to the wind, gets himself\r\nelected on a non-party ticket. 'When this happens there is usually\r\na great hullabaloo as soon as he declares himself. A section of his\r\nelectors agitates for his recall and presently some one else is elected\r\nin his stead. But non-partyism is much more than a mere cloak of\r\ninvisibility for enemies or conditional supporters of the Communists. I\r\nknow of considerable country districts which, in the face of every kind\r\nof agitation, insist on returning exclusively non-party delegates. The\r\nlocal Soviets in these districts are also non-party, and they elect\r\nusually a local Bolshevik to some responsible post to act as it were as\r\na buffer between themselves and the central authority. They manage local\r\naffairs in their own way, and, through the use of tact on both sides,\r\navoid falling foul of the more rigid doctrinaires in Moscow.\r\n\r\n\r\nEager reactionaries outside Russia will no doubt point to non-partyism\r\nas a symptom of friendship for themselves. It is nothing of the sort.\r\nOn all questions of the defense of the Republic the non-party voting is\r\ninvariably solid with that of the Communists. The non-party men do not\r\nwant Denikin. They do not want Baron Wrangel. They have never heard of\r\nProfessor Struhve. They do not particularly like the Communists.\r\nThey principally want to be left alone, and they principally fear any\r\nenforced continuation of war of any kind. If, in the course of time,\r\nthey come to have a definite political programme, I think it not\r\nimpossible that they may turn into a new kind of constitutional\r\ndemocrat. That does not mean that they will have any use for M. Milukov\r\nor for a monarch with whom M. Milukov might be ready to supply them.\r\nThe Constitution for which they will work will be that very Soviet\r\nConstitution which is now in abeyance, and the democracy which they\r\nassociate with it will be that form of democracy which were it to be\r\naccurately observed in the present state of Russia, that Constitution\r\nwould provide. The capitalist in Russia has long ago earned the position\r\nin which, according to the Constitution, he has a right to vote,\r\nsince he has long ago ceased to be a capitalist. Supposing the Soviet\r\nConstitution were today to be literally applied, it would be found\r\nthat practically no class except the priests would be excluded from\r\nthe franchise. And when this agitation swells in volume, it will be\r\nan agitation extremely difficult to resist, supposing Russia to be at\r\npeace, so that there will be no valid excuse with which to meet it.\r\nThese new constitutional democrats will be in the position of saying to\r\nthe Communists, \"Give us, without change, that very Constitution which\r\nyou yourselves drew up.\" I think they will find many friends inside the\r\nCommunist Party, particularly among those Communists who are also Trade\r\nUnionists. I heard something very like the arguments of this new variety\r\nof constitutional democrat in the Kremlin itself at an All-Russian\r\nConference of the Communist Party. A workman, Sapronov, turned suddenly\r\naside in a speech on quite another matter, and said with great violence\r\nthat the present system was in danger of running to seed and turning\r\ninto oligarchy, if not autocracy. Until the moment when he put his\r\nlisteners against him by a personal attack on Lenin, there was no doubt\r\nthat he had with him the sympathies of quite a considerable section of\r\nan exclusively Communist audience.\r\n\r\n\r\nGiven peace, given an approximate return to normal conditions,\r\nnon-partyism may well profoundly modify the activities of the\r\nCommunists. It would certainly be strong enough to prevent the rasher\r\nspirits among them from jeopardizing peace or from risking Russia's\r\nchance of convalescence for the sake of promoting in any way the growth\r\nof revolution abroad. Of course, so long as it is perfectly obvious that\r\nSoviet Russia is attacked, no serious growth of non-partyism is to be\r\nexpected, but it is obvious that any act of aggression on the part of\r\nthe Soviet Government, once Russia had attained peace-which she has not\r\nknown since 1914-would provide just the basis of angry discontent which\r\nmight divide even the disciplined ranks of the Communists and give\r\nnon-partyism an active, instead of a comparatively passive, backing\r\nthroughout the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nNon-partyism is already the peasants' way of expressing their aloofness\r\nfrom the revolution and, at the same time, their readiness to defend\r\nthat revolution against anybody who attacks it from outside. Lenin,\r\ntalking to me about the general attitude of the peasants, said: \"Hegel\r\nwrote 'What is the People? The people is that part of the nation which\r\ndoes not know what it wants.' That is a good description of the Russian\r\npeasantry at the present time, and it applies equally well to your\r\nArthur Hendersons and Sidney Webbs in England, and to all other\r\npeople like yourself who want incompatible things. The peasantry are\r\nindividualists, but they support us. We have, in some degree, to\r\nthank Kolchak and Denikin for that. They are in favor of the Soviet\r\nGovernment, but hanker after Free Trade, not understanding that the\r\ntwo things are self-contradictory. Of course, if they were a united\r\npolitical force they could swamp us, but they are disunited both in\r\ntheir interests and geographically. The interests of the poorer and\r\nmiddle class peasants are in contradiction to those of the rich peasant\r\nfarmer who employs laborers. The poorer and middle class see that we\r\nsupport them against the rich peasant, and also see that he is ready\r\nto support what is obviously not in their interests.\" I said, \"If State\r\nagriculture in Russia comes to be on a larger scale, will there not be\r\na sort of proletarianization of the peasants so that, in the long run,\r\ntheir interests will come to be more or less identical with those of the\r\nworkers in other than agricultural industry!\" He replied, \"Something in\r\nthat direction is being done, but it will have to be done very carefully\r\nand must take a very long time. When we are getting many thousands of\r\ntractors from abroad, then something of the sort would become possible.\"\r\nFinally I asked him point blank, \"Did he think they would pull through\r\nfar enough economically to be able to satisfy the needs of the peasantry\r\nbefore that same peasantry had organized a real political opposition\r\nthat should overwhelm them!\" Lenin laughed. \"If I could answer that\r\nquestion,\" he said, \"I could answer everything, for on the answer to\r\nthat question everything depends. I think we can. Yes, I think we can.\r\nBut I do not know that we can.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNon-partyism may well be the protoplasmic stage of the future political\r\nopposition of the peasants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSSIBILITIES\r\n\r\n\r\nI have done my best to indicate the essential facts in Russia's problem\r\ntoday, and to describe the organization and methods with which she is\r\nattempting its solution. I can give no opinion as to whether by these\r\nmeans the Russians will succeed in finding their way out of the quagmire\r\nof industrial ruin in which they are involved. I can only say that they\r\nare unlikely to find their way out by any other means. I think this is\r\ninstinctively felt in Russia. Not otherwise would it have been possible\r\nfor the existing organization, battling with one hand to save the towns\r\nfront starvation, to destroy with the other the various forces clothed\r\nand armed by Western Europe, which have attempted its undoing. The mere\r\nfact of continued war has, of course, made progress in the solution of\r\nthe economic problem almost impossible, but the fact that the economic\r\nproblem was unsolved, must have made war impossible, if it were not that\r\nthe instinct of the people was definitely against Russian or foreign\r\ninvaders. Consider for one moment the military position.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the enthusiasm for the Polish war began to subside (even among\r\nthe Communists) as soon as the Poles had been driven back from Kiev to\r\ntheir own frontiers, although the Poles are occupying an enormous area\r\nof non-Polish territory, although the Communists have had to conclude\r\nwith Poland a peace obviously unstable, the military position of Soviet\r\nRussia is infinitely better this time than it was in 1918 or 1919. In\r\n1918 the Ukraine was held by German troops and the district east of the\r\nUkraine was in the hands of General Krasnov, the author of a flattering\r\nletter to the Kaiser. In the northwest the Germans were at Pskov,\r\nVitebsk and Mohilev. We ourselves were at Murmansk and Archangel. In the\r\neast, the front which became known as that of Kolchak, was on the\r\nVolga. Soviet Russia was a little hungry island with every prospect of\r\nsubmersion. A year later the Germans had vanished, the flatterers of the\r\nKaiser had joined hands with those who were temporarily flattering the\r\nAllies, Yudenitch's troops were within sight of Petrograd, Denikin was\r\nat Orel, almost within striking distance of Moscow; there had been a\r\nstampede of desertion from the Red Army. There was danger that Finland\r\nmight strike at any moment. Although in the east Kolchak had been swept\r\nover the Urals to his ultimate disaster, the situation of Soviet Russia\r\nseemed even more desperate than in the year before. What is the position\r\ntoday! Esthonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Finland are at peace with\r\nRussia. The Polish peace brings comparative quiet to the western front,\r\nalthough the Poles, keeping the letter rather than the spirit of their\r\nagreement, have given Balahovitch the opportunity of establishing\r\nhimself in Minsk, where, it is said, that the pogroms of unlucky Jews\r\nshow that he has learnt nothing since his ejection from Pskov.\r\n\r\n\r\nBalahovitch's force is not important in itself, but its existence will\r\nmake it easy to start the war afresh along the whole new frontier of\r\nPoland, and that frontier shuts into Poland so large an anti-Polish\r\npopulation, that a moment may still come when desperate Polish statesmen\r\nmay again choose war as the least of many threatening evils. Still,\r\nfor the moment, Russia's western frontier is comparatively quiet. Her\r\nnorthern frontier is again the Arctic Sea. Her eastern frontier is in\r\nthe neighborhood of the Pacific. The Ukraine is disorderly, but occupied\r\nby no enemy; the only front on which serious fighting is proceeding is\r\nthe small semi-circle north of the Crimea. There Denikin's successor,\r\nsupported by the French but exultantly described by a German\r\nconservative newspaper as a \"German baron in Cherkass uniform,\" is\r\nholding the Crimea and a territory slightly larger than the peninsula\r\non the main land. Only to the immense efficiency of anti-Bolshevik\r\npropaganda can be ascribed the opinion, common in England but comic to\r\nany one who takes the trouble to look at a map, that Soviet Russia is on\r\nthe eve of military collapse.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn any case it is easy in a revolution to magnify the influence of\r\nmilitary events on internal affairs. In the first place, no one who\r\nhas not actually crossed the Russian front during the period of active\r\noperations can well realize how different are the revolutionary wars\r\nfrom that which ended in 1918. Advance on a broad front no longer\r\nmeans that a belt of men in touch with each other has moved definitely\r\nforward. It means that there have been a series of forward movements\r\nat widely separated, and with the very haziest of mutual, connections.\r\nThere will be violent fighting for a village or a railway station or the\r\npassage of a river. Small hostile groups will engage in mortal combat to\r\ndecide the possession of a desirable hut in which to sleep, but, except\r\nat these rare points of actual contact, the number of prisoners is far\r\nin excess of the number of casualties. Parties on each side will be\r\nperfectly ignorant of events to right or left of them, ignorant even of\r\ntheir gains and losses. Last year I ran into Whites in a village which\r\nthe Reds had assured me was strongly held by themselves, and these\r\nsame Whites refused to believe that the village where I had spent the\r\npreceding night was in the possession of the Reds. It is largely an\r\naffair of scouting parties, of patrols dodging each other through the\r\nforest tracks, of swift raids, of sudden conviction (often entirely\r\nerroneous) on the part of one side or the other, that it or the enemy\r\nhas been \"encircled.\" The actual number of combatants to a mile of front\r\nis infinitely less than during the German war. Further, since an immense\r\nproportion of these combatants on both sides have no wish to fight at\r\nall, being without patriotic or political convictions and very badly fed\r\nand clothed, and since it is more profitable to desert than to be\r\ntaken prisoner, desertion in bulk is not uncommon, and the deserters,\r\nhurriedly enrolled to fight on the other side, indignantly re-desert\r\nwhen opportunity offers. In this way the armies of Denikin and Yudenitch\r\nswelled like mushrooms and decayed with similar rapidity. Military\r\nevents of this kind, however spectacular they may seem abroad, do not\r\nhave the political effect that might be expected. I was in Moscow at the\r\nworst moment of the crisis in 1919 when practically everybody outside\r\nthe Government believed that Petrograd had already fallen, and I could\r\nnot but realize that the Government was stronger then than it had been\r\nin February of the same year, when it had a series of victories and\r\npeace with the Allies seemed for a moment to be in sight. A sort of fate\r\nseems to impel the Whites to neutralize with extraordinary rapidity any\r\ngood will for themelves which they may find among the population.\r\nThis is true of both sides, but seems to affect the Whites especially.\r\nAlthough General Baron Wrangel does indeed seem to have striven more\r\nsuccessfully than his predecessors not to set the population against him\r\nand to preserve the loyalty of his army, it may be said with absolute\r\ncertainty that any large success on his part would bring crowding to\r\nhis banner the same crowd of stupid reactionary officers who brought\r\nto nothing any mild desire for moderation that may have been felt by\r\nGeneral Denikin. If the area he controls increases, his power of\r\ncontrol over his subordinates will decrease, and the forces that led to\r\nDenikin's collapse will be set in motion in his case also. [*]\r\n\r\n     * On the day on which I send this book to the printers news\r\n     comes of Wrangel's collapse and flight.  I leave standing\r\n     what I have written concerning him, since it will apply to\r\n     any successor he may have.  Each general who has stepped\r\n     into Kolchak's shoes has eventually had to run away in them,\r\n     and always for the same reasons. It may be taken almost as\r\n     an axiom that the history of great country is that of its\r\n     centre, not of its periphery. The main course of English\r\n     history throughout the troubled seventeenth and eighteenth\r\n     centuries was never deflected from London.  French history\r\n     did not desert Paris, to make a new start at Toulon or at\r\n     Quiberon Bay. And only a fanatic could suppose that Russian\r\n     history would run away from Moscow, to begin again in a\r\n     semi-Tartar peninsula in the Black Sea.  Moscow changes\r\n     continually, and may so change as to make easy the return of\r\n     the \"refugees.\" Some have already returned.  But the\r\n     refugees will not return as conquerors.  Should a Russian\r\n     Napoleon (an unlikely figure, even in spite of our efforts)\r\n     appear, he will not throw away the invaluable asset of a\r\n     revolutionary war-cry.  He will have to fight some one, or\r\n     he will not be a Napoleon.  And whom will he fight but the\r\n     very people who, by keeping up the friction, have rubbed\r\n     Aladdin's ring so hard and so long that a Djinn, by no means\r\n     kindly disposed towards them, bursts forth at last to avenge\r\n     the breaking of his sleep?\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd, of course, should hostilities flare up again on the Polish\r\nfrontier, should the lions and lambs and jackals and eagles of Kossack,\r\nRussian, Ukrainian and Polish nationalists temporarily join forces, no\r\nmiracles of diplomacy will keep them from coming to blows. For all these\r\nreasons a military collapse of the Soviet Government at the present\r\ntime, even a concerted military advance of its enemies, is unlikely.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is undoubtedly true that the food situation in the towns is likely to\r\nbe worse this winter than it has yet been. Forcible attempts to get food\r\nfrom the peasantry will increase the existing hostility between town and\r\ncountry. There has been a very bad harvest in Russia. The bringing of\r\nfood from Siberia or the Kuban (if military activities do not make that\r\nimpossible) will impose an almost intolerable strain on the inadequate\r\ntransport. Yet I think internal collapse unlikely. It may be said almost\r\nwith certainty that Governments do not collapse until there is no one\r\nleft to defend them. That moment had arrived in the case of the Tsar. It\r\nhad arrived in the case of Kerensky. It has not arrived in the case\r\nof the Soviet Government for certain obvious reasons. For one thing,\r\na collapse of the Soviet Government at the present time would be\r\ndisconcerting, if not disastrous, to its more respectable enemies.\r\nIt would, of course, open the way to a practically unopposed military\r\nadvance, but at the same time it would present its enemies with enormous\r\nterritory, which would overwhelm the organizing powers which they have\r\nshown again and again to be quite inadequate to much smaller tasks. Nor\r\nwould collapse of the present Government turn a bad harvest into a\r\ngood one. Such a collapse would mean the breakdown of all existing\r\norganizations, and would intensify the horrors of famine for every town\r\ndweller. Consequently, though the desperation of hunger and resentment\r\nagainst inevitable requisitions may breed riots and revolts here and\r\nthere throughout the country, the men who, in other circumstances, might\r\ncoordinate such events, will refrain from doing anything of the sort.\r\nI do not say that collapse is impossible. I do say that it would be\r\nextremely undesirable from the point of view of almost everybody\r\nin Russia. Collapse of the present Government would mean at best a\r\nreproduction of the circumstances of 1917, with the difference that no\r\nintervention from without would be necessary to stimulate indiscriminate\r\nslaughter within. I say \"at best\" because I think it more likely that\r\ncollapse would be followed by a period of actual chaos. Any Government\r\nthat followed the Communists would be faced by the same economic\r\nproblem, and would have to choose between imposing measures very like\r\nthose of the Communists and allowing Russia to subside into a new area\r\nfor colonization. There are people who look upon this as a natural, even\r\na desirable, result of the revolution. They forget that the Russians\r\nhave never been a subject race, that they have immense powers of\r\npassive resistance, that they respond very readily to any idea that they\r\nunderstand, and that the idea of revolt against foreigners is difficult\r\nnot to understand. Any country that takes advantage of the Russian\r\npeople in a moment of helplessness will find, sooner or later, first\r\nthat it has united Russia against it, and secondly that it has given all\r\nRussians a single and undesirable view of the history of the last\r\nthree years. There will not be a Russian who will not believe that the\r\nartificial incubation of civil war within the frontiers of old Russia\r\nwas not deliberately undertaken by Western Europe with the object of so\r\nfar weakening Russia as to make her exploitation easy. Those who look\r\nwith equanimity even on this prospect forget that the creation in Europe\r\nof a new area for colonization, a knocking out of one of the sovereign\r\nnations, will create a vacuum, and that the effort to fill this vacuum\r\nwill set at loggerheads nations at present friendly and so produce a\r\nstruggle which may well do for Western Europe what Western Europe will\r\nhave done for Russia.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is of course possible that in some such way the Russian Revolution\r\nmay prove to be no more than the last desperate gesture of a stricken\r\ncivilization. My point is that if that is so, civilization in Russia\r\nwill not die without infecting us with its disease. It seems to me that\r\nour own civilization is ill already, slightly demented perhaps, and\r\nliable, like a man in delirium, to do things which tend to aggravate\r\nthe malady. I think that the whole of the Russian war, waged directly\r\nor indirectly by Western Europe, is an example of this sort of dementia,\r\nbut I cannot help believing that sanity will reassert itself in time.\r\nAt the present moment, to use a modification of Gusev's metaphor, Europe\r\nmay be compared to a burning house and the Governments of Europe to fire\r\nbrigades, each one engaged in trying to salve a wing or a room of the\r\nbuilding. It seems a pity that these fire brigades should be fighting\r\neach other, and forgetting the fire in their resentment of the fact that\r\nsome of them wear red uniforms and some wear blue. Any single room to\r\nwhich the fire gains complete control increases the danger of the whole\r\nbuilding, and I hope that before the roof falls in the firemen will come\r\nto their senses.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut turning from grim recognition of the danger, and from speculations\r\nas to the chance of the Russian Government collapsing, and as to the\r\nchanges in it that time may bring, let us consider what is likely to\r\nhappen supposing it does not collapse. I have already said that I think\r\ncollapse unlikely. Do the Russians show any signs of being able to carry\r\nout their programme, or has the fire gone so far during the quarrelling\r\nof the firemen as to make that task impossible?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI think that there is still a hope. There is as yet no sign of a general\r\nimprovement in Russia, nor is such an improvement possible until the\r\nRussians have at least carried out the first stage of their programme.\r\nIt would even not be surprising if things in general were to continue to\r\ngo to the bad during the carrying out of that first stage. Shortages of\r\nfood, of men, of tools, of materials, are so acute that they have had\r\nto choose those factories which are absolutely indispensable for the\r\ncarrying out of this stage, and make of them \"shock\" factories, like the\r\n\"shock\" troops of the war, giving them equipment over and above their\r\nrightful share of the impoverished stock, feeding their workmen even at\r\nthe cost of letting others go hungry. That means that other factories\r\nsuffer. No matter, say the Russians, if only that first stage makes\r\nprogress. Consequently, the only test that can be fairly applied is that\r\nof transport. Are they or are they not gaining on ruin in the matter of\r\nwagons and engines! Here are the figures of wagon repairs in the seven\r\nchief repairing shops up to the month of June:\r\n\r\n\r\n     December 1919............475 wagons were repaired.\r\n     January 1920.............656\r\n     February.................697\r\n     March...................1104\r\n     April...................1141\r\n     May.....................1154\r\n     June....................1161\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter elaborate investigation last year, Trotsky, as temporary Commissar\r\nof Transport, put out an order explaining that the railways, to keep up\r\ntheir present condition, must repair roughly 800 engines every month.\r\nDuring the first six months of 1920 they fulfilled this task in the\r\nfollowing percentages:\r\n\r\n\r\n     January..................32 per cent\r\n     February.................50\r\n     March....................66\r\n     April....................78\r\n     May......................98\r\n     June....................104\r\n\r\n\r\nI think that is a proof that, supposing normal relations existed between\r\nRussia and ourselves, the Russian would be able to tackle the first\r\nstage of the problem that lies before them, and would lie before them\r\nwhatever their Government might be. Unfortunately there is no proof that\r\nthis steady improvement can be continued, except under conditions of\r\ntrade with Western Europe. There are Russians who think they can pull\r\nthrough without us, and, remembering the miracles of which man is\r\ncapable when his back is to the wall, it would be rash to say that this\r\nis impossible. But other Russians point out gloomily that they have been\r\nusing certain parts taken from dead engines (engines past repair) in\r\norder to mend sick engines. They are now coming to the mending, not of\r\nsick engines merely, but of engines on which post-mortems have already\r\nbeen held. They are actually mending engines, parts of which have\r\nalready been taken out and used for the mending of other engines. There\r\nare consequently abnormal demands for such things as shafts and piston\r\nrings. They are particularly short of Babbitt metal and boiler tubes. In\r\nnormal times the average number of new tubes wanted for each engine put\r\nthrough the repair shops was 25 (10 to 15 for engines used in the more\r\nnortherly districts, and 30 to 40 for engines in the south where the\r\nwater is not so good). This number must now be taken as much higher,\r\nbecause during recent years tubes have not been regularly renewed.\r\nFurther, the railways have been widely making use of tubes taken from\r\ndead engines, that is to say, tubes already worn. Putting things at\r\ntheir very best, assuming that the average demand for tubes per engine\r\nwill be that of normal times, then, if 1,000 engines are to be repaired\r\nmonthly, 150,000 tubes will be wanted every six months. Now on the\r\n15th of June the total stock of tubes ready for use was 58,000, and the\r\nrailways could not expect to get more than another 13,000 in the\r\nnear future. Unless the factories are able to do better (and their\r\nimprovement depends on improvement in transport), railway repairs must\r\nagain deteriorate, since the main source of materials for it in Russia,\r\nnamely the dead engines, will presently be exhausted.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn this there is only one thing to be said. If, whether because we do\r\nnot trade with them, or from some other cause, the Russians are unable\r\nto proceed even in this first stage of their programme, it means an\r\nindefinite postponement of the moment when Russia will be able to export\r\nanything, and, consequently, that when at last we learn that we need\r\nRussia as a market, she will be a market willing to receive gifts, but\r\nunable to pay for anything at all. And that is a state of affairs a\r\ngreat deal more serious to ourselves than to the Russians, who can,\r\nafter all, live by wandering about their country and scratching the\r\nground, whereas we depend on the sale of our manufactured goods for the\r\npossibility of buying the food we cannot grow ourselves. If the Russians\r\nfail, their failure will affect not us alone. It will, by depriving her\r\nof a market, lessen Germany's power of recuperation, and consequently\r\nher power of fulfilling her engagements. What, then, is to happen to\r\nFrance? And, if we are to lose our market in Russia, and find very\r\nmuch weakened markets in Germany and France, we shall be faced with an\r\never-increasing burden of unemployment, with the growth, in fact, of the\r\nvery conditions in which alone we shall ourselves be unable to recover\r\nfrom the war. In such conditions, upheaval in England would be possible,\r\nand, for the dispassionate observer, there is a strange irony in the\r\nfact that the Communists desire that upheaval, and, at the same time,\r\ndesire a rebirth of the Russian market which would tend to make that\r\nupheaval unlikely, while those who most fear upheaval are precisely\r\nthose who urge us, by making recovery in Russia impossible, to improve\r\nthe chances of collapse at home. The peasants in Russia are not alone in\r\nwanting incompatible things.",
