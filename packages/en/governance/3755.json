But the tumult soon subsides. Time makes more\r\nconverts than reason.\r\n\r\nAs a long and violent abuse of power, is generally the Means of\r\ncalling the right of it in question (and in Matters too which might\r\nnever have been thought of, had not the Sufferers been aggravated\r\ninto the inquiry) and as the King of England hath undertaken in his\r\nOWN RIGHT, to support the Parliament in what he calls THEIRS, and\r\nas the good people of this country are grievously oppressed by the\r\ncombination, they have an undoubted privilege to inquire into the\r\npretensions of both, and equally to reject the usurpations of either.\r\n\r\nIn the following sheets, the author hath studiously avoided every\r\nthing which is personal among ourselves. Compliments as well as\r\ncensure to individuals make no part thereof. The wise, and the\r\nworthy, need not the triumph of a pamphlet; and those whose\r\nsentiments are injudicious, or unfriendly, will cease of themselves\r\nunless too much pains are bestowed upon their conversion.\r\n\r\nThe cause of America is in a great measure the cause of all\r\nmankind. Many circumstances have, and will arise, which are not\r\nlocal, but universal, and through which the principles of all Lovers\r\nof Mankind are affected, and in the Event of which, their Affections\r\nare interested. The laying of a Country desolate with Fire and Sword,\r\ndeclaring War against the natural rights of all Mankind, and\r\nextirpating the Defenders thereof from the Face of the Earth, is the\r\nConcern of every Man to whom Nature hath given the Power of feeling;\r\nof which Class, regardless of Party Censure, is\r\n\r\n                    THE AUTHOR\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      POSTSCRIPT TO PREFACE IN THE THIRD EDITION\r\n\r\nP. S. The Publication of this new Edition hath been delayed, with a\r\nView of taking notice (had it been necessary) of any Attempt to\r\nrefute the Doctrine of Independance: As no Answer hath yet appeared,\r\nit is now presumed that none will, the Time needful for getting such\r\na Performance ready for the Public being considerably past.\r\n\r\nWho the Author of this Production is, is wholly unnecessary to the\r\nPublic, as the Object for Attention is the DOCTRINE ITSELF, not the\r\nMAN. Yet it may not be unnecessary to say, That he is unconnected\r\nwith any Party, and under no sort of Influence public or private, but\r\nthe influence of reason and principle.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, February 14, 1776.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE ORIGIN AND DESIGN OF GOVERNMENT IN GENERAL, WITH CONCISE\r\nREMARKS ON THE ENGLISH CONSTITUTION\r\n\r\nSOME writers have so confounded society with government, as to leave\r\nlittle or no distinction between them; whereas they are not only\r\ndifferent, but have different origins. Society is produced by our\r\nwants, and government by wickedness; the former promotes our\r\nhappiness POSITIVELY by uniting our affections, the latter\r\nNEGATIVELY by restraining our vices. The one encourages\r\nintercourse, the other creates distinctions. The first is a patron,\r\nthe last a punisher.\r\n\r\nSociety in every state is a blessing, but government even in its\r\nbest state is but a necessary evil; in its worst state an intolerable\r\none; for when we suffer, or are exposed to the same miseries BY A\r\nGOVERNMENT, which we might expect in a country WITHOUT GOVERNMENT,\r\nour calamity is heightened by reflecting that we furnish the means by\r\nwhich we suffer. Government, like dress, is the badge of lost\r\ninnocence; the palaces of kings are built on the ruins of the bowers\r\nof paradise. For were the impulses of conscience clear, uniform, and\r\nirresistibly obeyed, man would need no other lawgiver; but that not\r\nbeing the case, he finds it necessary to surrender up a part of his\r\nproperty to furnish means for the protection of the rest; and this he\r\nis induced to do by the same prudence which in every other case\r\nadvises him out of two evils to choose the least. WHEREFORE,\r\nsecurity being the true design and end of government, it unanswerably\r\nfollows that whatever FORM thereof appears most likely to ensure it\r\nto us, with the least expence and greatest benefit, is preferable to\r\nall others.\r\n\r\nIn order to gain a clear and just idea of the design and end of\r\ngovernment, let us suppose a small number of persons settled in some\r\nsequestered part of the earth, unconnected with the rest, they will\r\nthen represent the first peopling of any country, or of the world. In\r\nthis state of natural liberty, society will be their first thought. A\r\nthousand motives will excite them thereto, the strength of one man is\r\nso unequal to his wants, and his mind so unfitted for perpetual\r\nsolitude, that he is soon obliged to seek assistance and relief of\r\nanother, who in his turn requires the same. Four or five united would\r\nbe able to raise a tolerable dwelling in the midst of a wilderness,\r\nbut ONE man might labour out the common period of life without\r\naccomplishing any thing; when he had felled his timber he could not\r\nremove it, nor erect it after it was removed; hunger in the mean time\r\nwould urge him from his work, and every different want call him a\r\ndifferent way. Disease, nay even misfortune would be death, for\r\nthough neither might be mortal, yet either would disable him from\r\nliving, and reduce him to a state in which he might rather be said to\r\nperish than to die.\r\n\r\nThis necessity, like a gravitating power, would soon form our newly\r\narrived emigrants into society, the reciprocal blessing of which,\r\nwould supersede, and render the obligations of law and government\r\nunnecessary while they remained perfectly just to each other; but as\r\nnothing but heaven is impregnable to vice, it will unavoidably\r\nhappen, that in proportion as they surmount the first difficulties of\r\nemigration, which bound them together in a common cause, they will\r\nbegin to relax in their duty and attachment to each other; and this\r\nremissness, will point out the necessity, of establishing some form\r\nof government to supply the defect of moral virtue.\r\n\r\nSome convenient tree will afford them a State-House, under the\r\nbranches of which, the whole colony may assemble to deliberate on\r\npublic matters. It is more than probable that their first laws will\r\nhave the title only of REGULATIONS, and be enforced by no other\r\npenalty than public disesteem. In this first parliament every man, by\r\nnatural right, will have a seat.\r\n\r\nBut as the colony increases, the public concerns will increase\r\nlikewise, and the distance at which the members may be separated,\r\nwill render it too inconvenient for all of them to meet on every\r\noccasion as at first, when their number was small, their habitations\r\nnear, and the public concerns few and trifling. This will point out\r\nthe convenience of their consenting to leave the legislative part to\r\nbe managed by a select number chosen from the whole body, who are\r\nsupposed to have the same concerns at stake which those have who\r\nappointed them, and who will act in the same manner as the whole body\r\nwould act were they present. If the colony continues increasing, it\r\nwill become necessary to augment the number of the representatives,\r\nand that the interest of every part of the colony may be attended to,\r\nit will be found best to divide the whole into convenient parts, each\r\npart sending its proper number; and that the ELECTED might never\r\nform to themselves an interest separate from the ELECTORS, prudence\r\nwill point out the propriety of having elections often; because as\r\nthe ELECTED might by that means return and mix again with the\r\ngeneral body of the ELECTORS in a few months, their fidelity to the\r\npublic will be secured by the prudent reflexion of not making a rod\r\nfor themselves. And as this frequent interchange will establish a\r\ncommon interest with every part of the community, they will mutually\r\nand naturally support each other, and on this (not on the unmeaning\r\nname of king) depends the STRENGTH OF GOVERNMENT, AND THE HAPPINESS\r\nOF THE GOVERNED.\r\n\r\nHere then is the origin and rise of government; namely, a mode\r\nrendered necessary by the inability of moral virtue to govern the\r\nworld; here too is the design and end of government, viz. freedom and\r\nsecurity. And however our eyes may be dazzled with snow, or our ears\r\ndeceived by sound; however prejudice may warp our wills, or interest\r\ndarken our understanding, the simple voice of nature and of reason\r\nwill say, it is right.\r\n\r\nI draw my idea of the form of government from a principle in\r\nnature, which no art can overturn, viz. that the more simple any\r\nthing is, the less liable it is to be disordered, and the easier\r\nrepaired when disordered; and with this maxim in view, I offer a few\r\nremarks on the so much boasted constitution of England. That it was\r\nnoble for the dark and slavish times in which it was erected, is\r\ngranted. When the world was over run with tyranny the least remove\r\ntherefrom was a glorious rescue. But that it is imperfect, subject to\r\nconvulsions, and incapable of producing what it seems to promise, is\r\neasily demonstrated.\r\n\r\nAbsolute governments (tho' the disgrace of human nature) have this\r\nadvantage with them, that they are simple; if the people suffer, they\r\nknow the head from which their suffering springs, know likewise the\r\nremedy, and are not bewildered by a variety of causes and cures. But\r\nthe constitution of England is so exceedingly complex, that the\r\nnation may suffer for years together without being able to discover\r\nin which part the fault lies, some will say in one and some in\r\nanother, and every political physician will advise a different\r\nmedicine.\r\n\r\nI know it is difficult to get over local or long standing\r\nprejudices, yet if we will suffer ourselves to examine the component\r\nparts of the English constitution, we shall find them to be the base\r\nremains of two ancient tyrannies, compounded with some new republican\r\nmaterials.\r\n\r\nFIRST. The remains of monarchical tyranny in the person of the\r\nking.\r\n\r\nSECONDLY. The remains of aristocratical tyranny in the persons of\r\nthe peers.\r\n\r\nTHIRDLY. The new republican materials, in the persons of the\r\ncommons, on whose virtue depends the freedom of England.\r\n\r\nThe two first, by being hereditary, are independent of the people;\r\nwherefore in a CONSTITUTIONAL SENSE they contribute nothing towards\r\nthe freedom of the state.\r\n\r\nTo say that the constitution of England is a UNION of three\r\npowers reciprocally CHECKING each other, is farcical, either the\r\nwords have no meaning, or they are flat contradictions.\r\n\r\nTo say that the commons is a check upon the king, presupposes two\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nFIRST. That the king is not to be trusted without being looked\r\nafter, or in other words, that a thirst for absolute power is the\r\nnatural disease of monarchy.\r\n\r\nSECONDLY. That the commons, by being appointed for that purpose,\r\nare either wiser or more worthy of confidence than the crown.\r\n\r\nBut as the same constitution which gives the commons a power to\r\ncheck the king by withholding the supplies, gives afterwards the king\r\na power to check the commons, by empowering him to reject their other\r\nbills; it again supposes that the king is wiser than those whom it\r\nhas already supposed to be wiser than him. A mere absurdity!\r\n\r\nThere is something exceedingly ridiculous in the composition of\r\nmonarchy; it first excludes a man from the means of information, yet\r\nempowers him to act in cases where the highest judgment is required.\r\nThe state of a king shuts him from the world, yet the business of a\r\nking requires him to know it thoroughly; wherefore the different\r\nparts, by unnaturally opposing and destroying each other, prove the\r\nwhole character to be absurd and useless.\r\n\r\nSome writers have explained the English constitution thus; the\r\nking, say they, is one, the people another; the peers are an house in\r\nbehalf of the king; the commons in behalf of the people; but this\r\nhath all the distinctions of an house divided against itself; and\r\nthough the expressions be pleasantly arranged, yet when examined they\r\nappear idle and ambiguous; and it will always happen, that the nicest\r\nconstruction that words are capable of, when applied to the\r\ndescription of some thing which either cannot exist, or is too\r\nincomprehensible to be within the compass of description, will be\r\nwords of sound only, and though they may amuse the ear, they cannot\r\ninform the mind, for this explanation includes a previous question,\r\nviz. HOW CAME THE KING BY A POWER WHICH THE PEOPLE ARE AFRAID TO\r\nTRUST, AND ALWAYS OBLIGED TO CHECK? Such a power could not be the\r\ngift of a wise people, neither can any power, WHICH NEEDS CHECKING,\r\nbe from God; yet the provision, which the constitution makes,\r\nsupposes such a power to exist.\r\n\r\nBut the provision is unequal to the task; the means either cannot\r\nor will not accomplish the end, and the whole affair is a felo de se;\r\nfor as the greater weight will always carry up the less, and as all\r\nthe wheels of a machine are put in motion by one, it only remains to\r\nknow which power in the constitution has the most weight, for that\r\nwill govern; and though the others, or a part of them, may clog, or,\r\nas the phrase is, check the rapidity of its motion, yet so long as\r\nthey cannot stop it, their endeavors will be ineffectual; the first\r\nmoving power will at last have its way, and what it wants in speed is\r\nsupplied by time.\r\n\r\nThat the crown is this overbearing part in the English constitution\r\nneeds not be mentioned, and that it derives its whole consequence\r\nmerely from being the giver of places and pensions is self-evident;\r\nwherefore, though we have been wise enough to shut and lock a door\r\nagainst absolute monarchy, we at the same time have been foolish\r\nenough to put the crown in possession of the key.\r\n\r\nThe prejudice of Englishmen, in favour of their own government by\r\nking, lords and commons, arises as much or more from national pride\r\nthan reason. Individuals are undoubtedly safer in England than in\r\nsome other countries, but the WILL of the king is as much the LAW\r\nof the land in Britain as in France, with this difference, that\r\ninstead of proceeding directly from his mouth, it is handed to the\r\npeople under the more formidable shape of an act of parliament. For\r\nthe fate of Charles the first, hath only made kings more subtle--not\r\nmore just.\r\n\r\nWherefore, laying aside all national pride and prejudice in favour\r\nof modes and forms, the plain truth is, that IT IS WHOLLY OWING TO\r\nTHE CONSTITUTION OF THE PEOPLE, AND NOT TO THE CONSTITUTION OF THE\r\nGOVERNMENT that the crown is not as oppressive in England as in\r\nTurkey.\r\n\r\nAn inquiry into the CONSTITUTIONAL ERRORS in the English form of\r\ngovernment is at this time highly necessary; for as we are never in a\r\nproper condition of doing justice to others, while we continue under\r\nthe influence of some leading partiality, so neither are we capable\r\nof doing it to ourselves while we remain fettered by any obstinate\r\nprejudice. And as a man, who is attached to a prostitute, is unfitted\r\nto choose or judge of a wife, so any prepossession in favour of a\r\nrotten constitution of government will disable us from discerning a\r\ngood one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         OF MONARCHY AND HEREDITARY SUCCESSION\r\n\r\nMANKIND being originally equals in the order of creation, the\r\nequality could only be destroyed by some subsequent circumstance; the\r\ndistinctions of rich, and poor, may in a great measure be accounted\r\nfor, and that without having recourse to the harsh ill sounding names\r\nof oppression and avarice. Oppression is often the CONSEQUENCE, but\r\nseldom or never the MEANS of riches; and though avarice will\r\npreserve a man from being necessitously poor, it generally makes him\r\ntoo timorous to be wealthy.\r\n\r\nBut there is another and greater distinction for which no truly\r\nnatural or religious reason can be assigned, and that is, the\r\ndistinction of men into KINGS and SUBJECTS. Male and female are the\r\ndistinctions of nature, good and bad the distinctions of heaven; but\r\nhow a race of men came into the world so exalted above the rest, and\r\ndistinguished like some new species, is worth enquiring into, and\r\nwhether they are the means of happiness or of misery to mankind.\r\n\r\nIn the early ages of the world, according to the scripture\r\nchronology, there were no kings; the consequence of which was there\r\nwere no wars; it is the pride of kings which throw mankind into\r\nconfusion. Holland without a king hath enjoyed more peace for this\r\nlast century than any of the monarchical governments in Europe.\r\nAntiquity favors the same remark; for the quiet and rural lives of\r\nthe first patriarchs hath a happy something in them, which vanishes\r\naway when we come to the history of Jewish royalty.\r\n\r\nGovernment by kings was first introduced into the world by the\r\nHeathens, from whom the children of Israel copied the custom. It was\r\nthe most prosperous invention the Devil ever set on foot for the\r\npromotion of idolatry. The Heathens paid divine honors to their\r\ndeceased kings, and the christian world hath improved on the plan by\r\ndoing the same to their living ones. How impious is the title of\r\nsacred majesty applied to a worm, who in the midst of his splendor is\r\ncrumbling into dust!\r\n\r\nAs the exalting one man so greatly above the rest cannot be\r\njustified on the equal rights of nature, so neither can it be\r\ndefended on the authority of scripture; for the will of the Almighty,\r\nas declared by Gideon and the prophet Samuel, expressly disapproves\r\nof government by kings. All anti-monarchical parts of scripture have\r\nbeen very smoothly glossed over in monarchical governments, but they\r\nundoubtedly merit the attention of countries which have their\r\ngovernments yet to form. \"RENDER UNTO CAESAR THE THINGS WHICH ARE\r\nCAESAR'S\" is the scripture doctrine of courts, yet it is no support\r\nof monarchical government, for the Jews at that time were without a\r\nking, and in a state of vassalage to the Romans.\r\n\r\nNear three thousand years passed away from the Mosaic account of\r\nthe creation, till the Jews under a national delusion requested a\r\nking. Till then their form of government (except in extraordinary\r\ncases, where the Almighty interposed) was a kind of republic\r\nadministered by a judge and the elders of the tribes. Kings they had\r\nnone, and it was held sinful to acknowledge any being under that\r\ntitle but the Lord of Hosts. And when a man seriously reflects on the\r\nidolatrous homage which is paid to the persons of Kings, he need not\r\nwonder, that the Almighty ever jealous of his honor, should\r\ndisapprove of a form of government which so impiously invades the\r\nprerogative of heaven.\r\n\r\nMonarchy is ranked in scripture as one of the sins of the Jews, for\r\nwhich a curse in reserve is denounced against them. The history of\r\nthat transaction is worth attending to.\r\n\r\nThe children of Israel being oppressed by the Midianites, Gideon\r\nmarched against them with a small army, and victory, thro' the divine\r\ninterposition, decided in his favour. The Jews elate with success,\r\nand attributing it to the generalship of Gideon, proposed making him\r\na king, saying, RULE THOU OVER US, THOU AND THY SON AND THY SON'S\r\nSON. Here was temptation in its fullest extent; not a kingdom only,\r\nbut an hereditary one, but Gideon in the piety of his soul replied,\r\nI WILL NOT RULE OVER YOU, NEITHER SHALL MY SON RULE OVER YOU. THE\r\nLORD SHALL RULE OVER YOU. Words need not be more explicit; Gideon\r\ndoth not DECLINE the honor, but denieth their right to give it;\r\nneither doth he compliment them with invented declarations of his\r\nthanks, but in the positive stile of a prophet charges them with\r\ndisaffection to their proper Sovereign, the King of heaven.\r\n\r\nAbout one hundred and thirty years after this, they fell again into\r\nthe same error. The hankering which the Jews had for the idolatrous\r\ncustoms of the Heathens, is something exceedingly unaccountable; but\r\nso it was, that laying hold of the misconduct of Samuel's two sons,\r\nwho were entrusted with some secular concerns, they came in an abrupt\r\nand clamorous manner to Samuel, saying, BEHOLD THOU ART OLD, AND THY\r\nSONS WALK NOT IN THY WAYS, NOW MAKE US A KING TO JUDGE US LIKE ALL\r\nTHE OTHER NATIONS. And here we cannot but observe that their motives\r\nwere bad, viz. that they might be LIKE unto other nations, i. e.\r\nthe Heathens, whereas their true glory laid in being as much UNLIKE\r\nthem as possible. BUT THE THING DISPLEASED SAMUEL WHEN THEY SAID,\r\nGIVE US A KING TO JUDGE US; AND SAMUEL PRAYED UNTO THE LORD, AND THE\r\nLORD SAID UNTO SAMUEL, HEARKEN UNTO THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE IN ALL\r\nTHAT THEY SAY UNTO THEE, FOR THEY HAVE NOT REJECTED THEE, BUT THEY\r\nHAVE REJECTED ME, THAT I SHOULD NOT REIGN OVER THEM. ACCORDING TO\r\nALL THE WORKS WHICH THEY HAVE DONE SINCE THE DAY THAT I BROUGHT THEM\r\nUP OUT OF EGYPT, EVEN UNTO THIS DAY; WHEREWITH THEY HAVE FORSAKEN ME\r\nAND SERVED OTHER GODS; SO DO THEY ALSO UNTO THEE. NOW THEREFORE\r\nHEARKEN UNTO THEIR VOICE, HOWBEIT, PROTEST SOLEMNLY UNTO THEM AND\r\nSHEW THEM THE MANNER OF THE KING THAT SHALL REIGN OVER THEM, I. E.\r\nnot of any particular king, but the general manner of the kings of\r\nthe earth, whom Israel was so eagerly copying after. And\r\nnotwithstanding the great distance of time and difference of manners,\r\nthe character is still in fashion. AND SAMUEL TOLD ALL THE WORDS OF\r\nTHE LORD UNTO THE PEOPLE, THAT ASKED OF HIM A KING. AND HE SAID, THIS\r\nSHALL BE THE MANNER OF THE KING THAT SHALL REIGN OVER YOU; HE WILL\r\nTAKE YOUR SONS AND APPOINT THEM FOR HIMSELF, FOR HIS CHARIOTS, AND TO\r\nBE HIS HORSEMEN, AND SOME SHALL RUN BEFORE HIS CHARIOTS (this\r\ndescription agrees with the present mode of impressing men) AND HE\r\nWILL APPOINT HIM CAPTAINS OVER THOUSANDS AND CAPTAINS OVER FIFTIES,\r\nAND WILL SET THEM TO EAR HIS GROUND AND TO READ HIS HARVEST, AND TO\r\nMAKE HIS INSTRUMENTS OF WAR, AND INSTRUMENTS OF HIS CHARIOTS; AND HE\r\nWILL TAKE YOUR DAUGHTERS TO BE CONFECTIONARIES, AND TO BE COOKS AND\r\nTO BE BAKERS (this describes the expence and luxury as well as the\r\noppression of kings) AND HE WILL TAKE YOUR FIELDS AND YOUR OLIVE\r\nYARDS, EVEN THE BEST OF THEM, AND GIVE THEM TO HIS SERVANTS; AND HE\r\nWILL TAKE THE TENTH OF YOUR FEED, AND OF YOUR VINEYARDS, AND GIVE\r\nTHEM TO HIS OFFICERS AND TO HIS SERVANTS (by which we see that\r\nbribery, corruption, and favoritism are the standing vices of kings)\r\nAND HE WILL TAKE THE TENTH OF YOUR MEN SERVANTS, AND YOUR MAID\r\nSERVANTS, AND YOUR GOODLIEST YOUNG MEN AND YOUR ASSES, AND PUT THEM\r\nTO HIS WORK; AND HE WILL TAKE THE TENTH OF YOUR SHEEP, AND YE SHALL\r\nBE HIS SERVANTS, AND YE SHALL CRY OUT IN THAT DAY BECAUSE OF YOUR\r\nKING WHICH YE SHALL HAVE CHOSEN, AND THE LORD WILL NOT HEAR YOU IN\r\nTHAT DAY. This accounts for the continuation of monarchy; neither do\r\nthe characters of the few good kings which have lived since, either\r\nsanctify the title, or blot out the sinfulness of the origin; the\r\nhigh encomium given of David takes no notice of him OFFICIALLY AS A\r\nKING, but only as a MAN after God's own heart. NEVERTHELESS THE\r\nPEOPLE REFUSED TO OBEY THE VOICE OF SAMUEL, AND THEY SAID, NAY, BUT\r\nWE WILL HAVE A KING OVER US, THAT WE MAY BE LIKE ALL THE NATIONS, AND\r\nTHAT OUR KING MAY JUDGE US, AND GO OUT BEFORE US, AND FIGHT OUR\r\nBATTLES. Samuel continued to reason with them, but to no purpose; he\r\nset before them their ingratitude, but all would not avail; and\r\nseeing them fully bent on their folly, he cried out, I WILL CALL\r\nUNTO THE LORD, AND HE SHALL SEND THUNDER AND RAIN (which then was a\r\npunishment, being in the time of wheat harvest) THAT YE MAY PERCEIVE\r\nAND SEE THAT YOUR WICKEDNESS IS GREAT WHICH YE HAVE DONE IN THE SIGHT\r\nOF THE LORD, IN ASKING YOU A KING. SO SAMUEL CALLED UNTO THE LORD,\r\nAND THE LORD SENT THUNDER AND RAIN THAT DAY, AND ALL THE PEOPLE\r\nGREATLY FEARED THE LORD AND SAMUEL. AND ALL THE PEOPLE SAID UNTO\r\nSAMUEL, PRAY FOR THY SERVANTS UNTO THE LORD THY GOD THAT WE DIE NOT,\r\nFOR WE HAVE ADDED UNTO OUR SINS THIS EVIL, TO ASK A KING. These\r\nportions of scripture are direct and positive. They admit of no\r\nequivocal construction. That the Almighty hath here entered his\r\nprotest against monarchical government is true, or the scripture is\r\nfalse. And a man hath good reason to believe that there is as much of\r\nking-craft, as priest-craft, in withholding the scripture from the\r\npublic in Popish countries. For monarchy in every instance is the\r\nPopery of government.\r\n\r\nTo the evil of monarchy we have added that of hereditary\r\nsuccession; and as the first is a degradation and lessening of\r\nourselves, so the second, claimed as a matter of right, is an insult\r\nand an imposition on posterity. For all men being originally equals,\r\nno ONE by BIRTH could have a right to set up his own family in\r\nperpetual preference to all others for ever, and though himself might\r\ndeserve SOME decent degree of honors of his cotemporaries, yet his\r\ndescendants might be far too unworthy to inherit them. One of the\r\nstrongest NATURAL proofs of the folly of hereditary right in kings,\r\nis, that nature disapproves it, otherwise, she would not so\r\nfrequently turn it into ridicule by giving mankind an ASS FOR A\r\nLION.\r\n\r\nSecondly, as no man at first could possess any other public honors\r\nthan were bestowed upon him, so the givers of those honors could have\r\nno power to give away the right of posterity, and though they might\r\nsay \"We choose you for OUR head,\" they could not, without manifest\r\ninjustice to their children, say \"that your children and your\r\nchildren's children shall reign over OURS for ever.\" Because such\r\nan unwise, unjust, unnatural compact might (perhaps) in the next\r\nsuccession put them under the government of a rogue or a fool. Most\r\nwise men, in their private sentiments, have ever treated hereditary\r\nright with contempt; yet it is one of those evils, which when once\r\nestablished is not easily removed; many submit from fear, others from\r\nsuperstition, and the more powerful part shares with the king the\r\nplunder of the rest.\r\n\r\nThis is supposing the present race of kings in the world to have\r\nhad an honorable origin; whereas it is more than probable, that could\r\nwe take off the dark covering of antiquity, and trace them to their\r\nfirst rise, that we should find the first of them nothing better than\r\nthe principal ruffian of some restless gang, whose savage manners or\r\npre-eminence in subtility obtained him the title of chief among\r\nplunderers; and who by increasing in power, and extending his\r\ndepredations, over-awed the quiet and defenceless to purchase their\r\nsafety by frequent contributions. Yet his electors could have no idea\r\nof giving hereditary right to his descendants, because such a\r\nperpetual exclusion of themselves was incompatible with the free and\r\nunrestrained principles they professed to live by. Wherefore,\r\nhereditary succession in the early ages of monarchy could not take\r\nplace as a matter of claim, but as something casual or complimental;\r\nbut as few or no records were extant in those days, and traditionary\r\nhistory stuffed with fables, it was very easy, after the lapse of a\r\nfew generations, to trump up some superstitious tale, conveniently\r\ntimed, Mahomet like, to cram hereditary right down the throats of the\r\nvulgar. Perhaps the disorders which threatened, or seemed to\r\nthreaten, on the decease of a leader and the choice of a new one (for\r\nelections among ruffians could not be very orderly) induced many at\r\nfirst to favor hereditary pretensions; by which means it happened, as\r\nit hath happened since, that what at first was submitted to as a\r\nconvenience, was afterwards claimed as a right.\r\n\r\nEngland, since the conquest, hath known some few good monarchs, but\r\ngroaned beneath a much larger number of bad ones; yet no man in his\r\nsenses can say that their claim under William the Conqueror is a very\r\nhonorable one. A French bastard landing with an armed banditti, and\r\nestablishing himself king of England against the consent of the\r\nnatives, is in plain terms a very paltry rascally original. It\r\ncertainly hath no divinity in it. However, it is needless to spend\r\nmuch time in exposing the folly of hereditary right, if there are any\r\nso weak as to believe it, let them promiscuously worship the ass and\r\nlion, and welcome. I shall neither copy their humility, nor disturb\r\ntheir devotion.\r\n\r\nYet I should be glad to ask how they suppose kings came at first?\r\nThe question admits but of three answers, viz. either by lot, by\r\nelection, or by usurpation. If the first king was taken by lot, it\r\nestablishes a precedent for the next, which excludes hereditary\r\nsuccession. Saul was by lot, yet the succession was not hereditary,\r\nneither does it appear from that transaction there was any intention\r\nit ever should. If the first king of any country was by election,\r\nthat likewise establishes a precedent for the next; for to say, that\r\nthe RIGHT of all future generations is taken away, by the act of\r\nthe first electors, in their choice not only of a king, but of a\r\nfamily of kings for ever, hath no parrallel in or out of scripture\r\nbut the doctrine of original sin, which supposes the free will of all\r\nmen lost in Adam; and from such comparison, and it will admit of no\r\nother, hereditary succession can derive no glory. For as in Adam all\r\nsinned, and as in the first electors all men obeyed; as in the one\r\nall mankind were subjected to Satan, and in the other to Sovereignty;\r\nas our innocence was lost in the first, and our authority in the\r\nlast; and as both disable us from reassuming some former state and\r\nprivilege, it unanswerably follows that original sin and hereditary\r\nsuccession are parallels. Dishonorable rank! Inglorious connexion!\r\nYet the most subtile sophist cannot produce a juster simile.\r\n\r\nAs to usurpation, no man will be so hardy as to defend it; and that\r\nWilliam the Conqueror was an usurper is a fact not to be\r\ncontradicted. The plain truth is, that the antiquity of English\r\nmonarchy will not bear looking into.\r\n\r\nBut it is not so much the absurdity as the evil of hereditary\r\nsuccession which concerns mankind. Did it ensure a race of good and\r\nwise men it would have the seal of divine authority, but as it opens\r\na door to the FOOLISH, the WICKED, and the IMPROPER, it hath in\r\nit the nature of oppression. Men who look upon themselves born to\r\nreign, and others to obey, soon grow insolent; selected from the rest\r\nof mankind their minds are early poisoned by importance; and the\r\nworld they act in differs so materially from the world at large, that\r\nthey have but little opportunity of knowing its true interests, and\r\nwhen they succeed to the government are frequently the most ignorant\r\nand unfit of any throughout the dominions.\r\n\r\nAnother evil which attends hereditary succession is, that the\r\nthrone is subject to be possessed by a minor at any age; all which\r\ntime the regency, acting under the cover of a king, have every\r\nopportunity and inducement to betray their trust. The same national\r\nmisfortune happens, when a king worn out with age and infirmity,\r\nenters the last stage of human weakness. In both these cases the\r\npublic becomes a prey to every miscreant, who can tamper successfully\r\nwith the follies either of age or infancy.\r\n\r\nThe most plausible plea, which hath ever been offered in favour of\r\nhereditary succession, is, that it preserves a nation from civil\r\nwars; and were this true, it would be weighty; whereas, it is the\r\nmost barefaced falsity ever imposed upon mankind. The whole history\r\nof England disowns the fact. Thirty kings and two minors have reigned\r\nin that distracted kingdom since the conquest, in which time there\r\nhave been (including the Revolution) no less than eight civil wars\r\nand nineteen rebellions. Wherefore instead of making for peace, it\r\nmakes against it, and destroys the very foundation it seems to stand\r\non.\r\n\r\nThe contest for monarchy and succession, between the houses of York\r\nand Lancaster, laid England in a scene of blood for many years.\r\nTwelve pitched battles, besides skirmishes and sieges, were fought\r\nbetween Henry and Edward. Twice was Henry prisoner to Edward, who in\r\nhis turn was prisoner to Henry. And so uncertain is the fate of war\r\nand the temper of a nation, when nothing but personal matters are the\r\nground of a quarrel, that Henry was taken in triumph from a prison to\r\na palace, and Edward obliged to fly from a palace to a foreign land;\r\nyet, as sudden transitions of temper are seldom lasting, Henry in his\r\nturn was driven from the throne, and Edward recalled to succeed him.\r\nThe parliament always following the strongest side.\r\n\r\nThis contest began in the reign of Henry the Sixth, and was not\r\nentirely extinguished till Henry the Seventh, in whom the families\r\nwere united. Including a period of 67 years, viz. from 1422 to 1489.\r\n\r\nIn short, monarchy and succession have laid (not this or that\r\nkingdom only) but the world in blood and ashes. 'Tis a form of\r\ngovernment which the word of God bears testimony against, and blood\r\nwill attend it.\r\n\r\nIf we inquire into the business of a king, we shall find that in\r\nsome countries they have none; and after sauntering away their lives\r\nwithout pleasure to themselves or advantage to the nation, withdraw\r\nfrom the scene, and leave their successors to tread the same idle\r\nround. In absolute monarchies the whole weight of business, civil and\r\nmilitary, lies on the king; the children of Israel in their request\r\nfor a king, urged this plea \"that he may judge us, and go out before\r\nus and fight our battles.\" But in countries where he is neither a\r\njudge nor a general, as in England, a man would be puzzled to know\r\nwhat IS his business.\r\n\r\nThe nearer any government approaches to a republic the less\r\nbusiness there is for a king. It is somewhat difficult to find a\r\nproper name for the government of England. Sir William Meredith calls\r\nit a republic; but in its present state it is unworthy of the name,\r\nbecause the corrupt influence of the crown, by having all the places\r\nin its disposal, hath so effectually swallowed up the power, and\r\neaten out the virtue of the house of commons (the republican part in\r\nthe constitution) that the government of England is nearly as\r\nmonarchical as that of France or Spain. Men fall out with names\r\nwithout understanding them. For it is the republican and not the\r\nmonarchical part of the constitution of England which Englishmen\r\nglory in, viz. the liberty of choosing an house of commons from out\r\nof their own body--and it is easy to see that when republican virtue\r\nfails, slavery ensues. Why is the constitution of England sickly, but\r\nbecause monarchy hath poisoned the republic, the crown hath engrossed\r\nthe commons?\r\n\r\nIn England a king hath little more to do than to make war and give\r\naway places; which in plain terms, is to impoverish the nation and\r\nset it together by the ears. A pretty business indeed for a man to be\r\nallowed eight hundred thousand sterling a year for, and worshipped\r\ninto the bargain! Of more worth is one honest man to society and in\r\nthe sight of God, than all the crowned ruffians that ever lived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    THOUGHTS ON THE PRESENT STATE OF AMERICAN AFFAIRS\r\n\r\nIN the following pages I offer nothing more than simple facts, plain\r\narguments, and common sense; and have no other preliminaries to\r\nsettle with the reader, than that he will divest himself of prejudice\r\nand prepossession, and suffer his reason and his feelings to\r\ndetermine for themselves; that he will put ON, or rather that he\r\nwill not put OFF, the true character of a man, and generously\r\nenlarge his views beyond the present day.\r\n\r\nVolumes have been written on the subject of the struggle between\r\nEngland and America. Men of all ranks have embarked in the\r\ncontroversy, from different motives, and with various designs; but\r\nall have been ineffectual, and the period of debate is closed. Arms,\r\nas the last resource, decide the contest; the appeal was the choice\r\nof the king, and the continent hath accepted the challenge.\r\n\r\nIt hath been reported of the late Mr Pelham (who tho' an able\r\nminister was not without his faults) that on his being attacked in\r\nthe house of commons, on the score, that his measures were only of a\r\ntemporary kind, replied, \"THEY WILL LAST MY TIME.\" Should a thought\r\nso fatal and unmanly possess the colonies in the present contest, the\r\nname of ancestors will be remembered by future generations with\r\ndetestation.\r\n\r\nThe sun never shined on a cause of greater worth. 'Tis not the\r\naffair of a city, a country, a province, or a kingdom, but of a\r\ncontinent--of at least one eighth part of the habitable globe. 'Tis\r\nnot the concern of a day, a year, or an age; posterity are virtually\r\ninvolved in the contest, and will be more or less affected, even to\r\nthe end of time, by the proceedings now. Now is the seed time of\r\ncontinental union, faith and honor. The least fracture now will be\r\nlike a name engraved with the point of a pin on the tender rind of a\r\nyoung oak; The wound will enlarge with the tree, and posterity read\r\nit in full grown characters.\r\n\r\nBy referring the matter from argument to arms, a new era for\r\npolitics is struck; a new method of thinking hath arisen. All plans,\r\nproposals, &c. prior to the nineteenth of April, I. E. to the\r\ncommencement of hostilities, are like the almanacks of the last year;\r\nwhich, though proper then, are superceded and useless now. Whatever\r\nwas advanced by the advocates on either side of the question then,\r\nterminated in one and the same point, viz. a union with\r\nGreat Britain; the only difference between the parties was the method\r\nof effecting it; the one proposing force, the other friendship; but\r\nit hath so far happened that the first hath failed, and the second\r\nhath withdrawn her influence.\r\n\r\nAs much hath been said of the advantages of reconciliation, which,\r\nlike an agreeable dream, hath passed away and left us as we were, it\r\nis but right, that we should examine the contrary side of the\r\nargument, and inquire into some of the many material injuries which\r\nthese colonies sustain, and always will sustain, by being connected\r\nwith, and dependant on Great Britain. To examine that connexion and\r\ndependance, on the principles of nature and common sense, to see what\r\nwe have to trust to, if separated, and what we are to expect, if\r\ndependant.\r\n\r\nI have heard it asserted by some, that as America hath flourished\r\nunder her former connexion with Great Britain, that the same\r\nconnexion is necessary towards her future happiness, and will always\r\nhave the same effect. Nothing can be more fallacious than this kind\r\nof argument. We may as well assert that because a child has thrived\r\nupon milk, that it is never to have meat, or that the first twenty\r\nyears of our lives is to become a precedent for the next twenty. But\r\neven this is admitting more than is true, for I answer roundly, that\r\nAmerica would have flourished as much, and probably much more, had no\r\nEuropean power had any thing to do with her. The commerce, by which\r\nshe hath enriched herself are the necessaries of life, and will\r\nalways have a market while eating is the custom of Europe.\r\n\r\nBut she has protected us, say some. That she hath engrossed us is\r\ntrue, and defended the continent at our expence as well as her own is\r\nadmitted, and she would have defended Turkey from the same motive,\r\nviz. the sake of trade and dominion.\r\n\r\nAlas, we have been long led away by ancient prejudices, and made\r\nlarge sacrifices to superstition. We have boasted the protection of\r\nGreat Britain, without considering, that her motive was INTEREST\r\nnot ATTACHMENT; that she did not protect us from OUR ENEMIES on\r\nOUR ACCOUNT, but from HER ENEMIES on HER OWN ACCOUNT, from\r\nthose who had no quarrel with us on any OTHER ACCOUNT, and who will\r\nalways be our enemies on the SAME ACCOUNT. Let Britain wave her\r\npretensions to the continent, or the continent throw off the\r\ndependance, and we should be at peace with France and Spain were they\r\nat war with Britain. The miseries of Hanover last war ought to warn\r\nus against connexions.\r\n\r\nIt hath lately been asserted in parliament, that the colonies have\r\nno relation to each other but through the parent country, I. E.\r\nthat Pennsylvania and the Jerseys, and so on for the rest, are sister\r\ncolonies by the way of England; this is certainly a very round-about\r\nway of proving relationship, but it is the nearest and only true way\r\nof proving enemyship, if I may so call it. France and Spain never\r\nwere, nor perhaps ever will be our enemies as AMERICANS, but as our\r\nbeing the SUBJECTS OF GREAT BRITAIN.\r\n\r\nBut Britain is the parent country, say some. Then the more shame\r\nupon her conduct. Even brutes do not devour their young, nor savages\r\nmake war upon their families; wherefore the assertion, if true, turns\r\nto her reproach; but it happens not to be true, or only partly so,\r\nand the phrase PARENT or MOTHER COUNTRY hath been jesuitically\r\nadopted by the king and his parasites, with a low papistical design\r\nof gaining an unfair bias on the credulous weakness of our minds.\r\nEurope, and not England, is the parent country of America. This new\r\nworld hath been the asylum for the persecuted lovers of civil and\r\nreligious liberty from EVERY PART of Europe. Hither have they fled,\r\nnot from the tender embraces of the mother, but from the cruelty of\r\nthe monster; and it is so far true of England, that the same tyranny\r\nwhich drove the first emigrants from home, pursues their descendants\r\nstill.\r\n\r\nIn this extensive quarter of the globe, we forget the narrow limits\r\nof three hundred and sixty miles (the extent of England) and carry\r\nour friendship on a larger scale; we claim brotherhood with every\r\nEuropean christian, and triumph in the generosity of the sentiment.\r\n\r\nIt is pleasant to observe by what regular gradations we surmount\r\nthe force of local prejudice, as we enlarge our acquaintance with the\r\nworld. A man born in any town in England divided into parishes, will\r\nnaturally associate most with his fellow parishioners (because their\r\ninterests in many cases will be common) and distinguish him by the\r\nname of NEIGHBOUR; if he meet him but a few miles from home, he\r\ndrops the narrow idea of a street, and salutes him by the name of\r\nTOWNSMAN; if he travel out of the county, and meet him in any\r\nother, he forgets the minor divisions of street and town, and calls\r\nhim COUNTRYMAN; i. e. COUNTY-MAN; but if in their foreign\r\nexcursions they should associate in France or any other part of\r\nEUROPE, their local remembrance would be enlarged into that of\r\nENGLISHMEN. And by a just parity of reasoning, all Europeans\r\nmeeting in America, or any other quarter of the globe, are\r\nCOUNTRYMEN; for England, Holland, Germany, or Sweden, when compared\r\nwith the whole, stand in the same places on the larger scale, which\r\nthe divisions of street, town, and county do on the smaller ones;\r\ndistinctions too limited for continental minds. Not one third of the\r\ninhabitants, even of this province, are of English descent. Wherefore\r\nI reprobate the phrase of parent or mother country applied to England\r\nonly, as being false, selfish, narrow and ungenerous.\r\n\r\nBut admitting, that we were all of English descent, what does it\r\namount to? Nothing. Britain, being now an open enemy, extinguishes\r\nevery other name and title: And to say that reconciliation is our\r\nduty, is truly farcical. The first king of England, of the present\r\nline (William the Conqueror) was a Frenchman, and half the Peers of\r\nEngland are descendants from the same country; wherefore, by the same\r\nmethod of reasoning, England ought to be governed by France.\r\n\r\nMuch hath been said of the united strength of Britain and the\r\ncolonies, that in conjunction they might bid defiance to the world.\r\nBut this is mere presumption; the fate of war is uncertain, neither\r\ndo the expressions mean any thing; for this continent would never\r\nsuffer itself to be drained of inhabitants, to support the British\r\narms in either Asia, Africa, or Europe.\r\n\r\nBesides, what have we to do with setting the world at defiance? Our\r\nplan is commerce, and that, well attended to, will secure us the\r\npeace and friendship of all Europe; because, it is the interest of\r\nall Europe to have America a FREE PORT. Her trade will always be a\r\nprotection, and her barrenness of gold and silver secure her from\r\ninvaders.\r\n\r\nI challenge the warmest advocate for reconciliation, to shew, a\r\nsingle advantage that this continent can reap, by being connected\r\nwith Great Britain. I repeat the challenge, not a single advantage is\r\nderived. Our corn will fetch its price in any market in Europe, and\r\nour imported goods must be paid for buy them where we will.\r\n\r\nBut the injuries and disadvantages we sustain by that connection,\r\nare without number; and our duty to mankind at large, as well as to\r\nourselves, instruct us to renounce the alliance: Because, any\r\nsubmission to, or dependance on Great Britain, tends directly to\r\ninvolve this continent in European wars and quarrels; and sets us at\r\nvariance with nations, who would otherwise seek our friendship, and\r\nagainst whom, we have neither anger nor complaint. As Europe is our\r\nmarket for trade, we ought to form no partial connection with any\r\npart of it. It is the true interest of America to steer clear of\r\nEuropean contentions, which she never can do, while by her dependance\r\non Britain, she is made the make-weight in the scale on British\r\npolitics.\r\n\r\nEurope is too thickly planted with kingdoms to be long at peace,\r\nand whenever a war breaks out between England and any foreign power,\r\nthe trade of America goes to ruin, BECAUSE OF HER CONNECTION WITH\r\nBRITAIN. The next war may not turn out like the last, and should it\r\nnot, the advocates for reconciliation now will be wishing for\r\nseparation then, because, neutrality in that case, would be a safer\r\nconvoy than a man of war. Every thing that is right or natural pleads\r\nfor separation. The blood of the slain, the weeping voice of nature\r\ncries, 'TIS TIME TO PART. Even the distance at which the Almighty\r\nhath placed England and America, is a strong and natural proof, that\r\nthe authority of the one, over the other, was never the design of\r\nHeaven. The time likewise at which the continent was discovered, adds\r\nweight to the argument, and the manner in which it was peopled\r\nencreases the force of it. The reformation was preceded by the\r\ndiscovery of America, as if the Almighty graciously meant to open a\r\nsanctuary to the persecuted in future years, when home should afford\r\nneither friendship nor safety.\r\n\r\nThe authority of Great Britain over this continent, is a form of\r\ngovernment, which sooner or later must have an end: And a serious\r\nmind can draw no true pleasure by looking forward, under the painful\r\nand positive conviction, that what he calls \"the present\r\nconstitution\" is merely temporary. As parents, we can have no joy,\r\nknowing that THIS GOVERNMENT is not sufficiently lasting to ensure\r\nany thing which we may bequeath to posterity: And by a plain method\r\nof argument, as we are running the next generation into debt, we\r\nought to do the work of it, otherwise we use them meanly and\r\npitifully. In order to discover the line of our duty rightly, we\r\nshould take our children in our hand, and fix our station a few years\r\nfarther into life; that eminence will present a prospect, which a few\r\npresent fears and prejudices conceal from our sight.\r\n\r\nThough I would carefully avoid giving unnecessary offence, yet I am\r\ninclined to believe, that all those who espouse the doctrine of\r\nreconciliation, may be included within the following descriptions.\r\nInterested men, who are not to be trusted; weak men, who CANNOT\r\nsee; prejudiced men, who WILL NOT see; and a certain set of\r\nmoderate men, who think better of the European world than it\r\ndeserves; and this last class, by an ill-judged deliberation, will be\r\nthe cause of more calamities to this continent, than all the other\r\nthree.\r\n\r\nIt is the good fortune of many to live distant from the scene of\r\nsorrow; the evil is not sufficiently brought to THEIR doors to make\r\nTHEM feel the precariousness with which all American property is\r\npossessed. But let our imaginations transport us for a few moments to\r\nBoston, that seat of wretchedness will teach us wisdom, and instruct\r\nus for ever to renounce a power in whom we can have no trust. The\r\ninhabitants of that unfortunate city, who but a few months ago were\r\nin ease and affluence, have now, no other alternative than to stay\r\nand starve, or turn out to beg. Endangered by the fire of their\r\nfriends if they continue within the city, and plundered by the\r\nsoldiery if they leave it. In their present condition they are\r\nprisoners without the hope of redemption, and in a general attack for\r\ntheir relief, they would be exposed to the fury of both armies.\r\n\r\nMen of passive tempers look somewhat lightly over the offences of\r\nBritain, and, still hoping for the best, are apt to call out, \"COME,\r\nCOME, WE SHALL BE FRIENDS AGAIN, FOR ALL THIS.\" But examine the\r\npassions and feelings of mankind, Bring the doctrine of\r\nreconciliation to the touchstone of nature, and then tell me, whether\r\nyou can hereafter love, honour, and faithfully serve the power that\r\nhath carried fire and sword into your land? If you cannot do all\r\nthese, then are you only deceiving yourselves, and by your delay\r\nbringing ruin upon posterity. Your future connection with Britain,\r\nwhom you can neither love nor honour, will be forced and unnatural,\r\nand being formed only on the plan of present convenience, will in a\r\nlittle time fall into a relapse more wretched than the first. But if\r\nyou say, you can still pass the violations over, then I ask, Hath\r\nyour house been burnt? Hath your property been destroyed before your\r\nface? Are your wife and children destitute of a bed to lie on, or\r\nbread to live on? Have you lost a parent or a child by their hands,\r\nand yourself the ruined and wretched survivor? If you have not, then\r\nare you not a judge of those who have. But if you have, and still can\r\nshake hands with the murderers, then you are unworthy of the name of\r\nhusband, father, friend, or lover, and whatever may be your rank or\r\ntitle in life, you have the heart of a coward, and the spirit of a\r\nsycophant.\r\n\r\nThis is not inflaming or exaggerating matters, but trying them by\r\nthose feelings and affections which nature justifies, and without\r\nwhich, we should be incapable of discharging the social duties of\r\nlife, or enjoying the felicities of it. I mean not to exhibit horror\r\nfor the purpose of provoking revenge, but to awaken us from fatal and\r\nunmanly slumbers, that we may pursue determinately some fixed object.\r\nIt is not in the power of Britain or of Europe to conquer America, if\r\nshe do not conquer herself by DELAY and TIMIDITY. The present\r\nwinter is worth an age if rightly employed, but if lost or neglected,\r\nthe whole continent will partake of the misfortune; and there is no\r\npunishment which that man will not deserve, be he who, or what, or\r\nwhere he will, that may be the means of sacrificing a season so\r\nprecious and useful.\r\n\r\nIt is repugnant to reason, to the universal order of things to all\r\nexamples from former ages, to suppose, that this continent can longer\r\nremain subject to any external power. The most sanguine in Britain\r\ndoes not think so. The utmost stretch of human wisdom cannot, at this\r\ntime, compass a plan short of separation, which can promise the\r\ncontinent even a year's security. Reconciliation is NOW a falacious\r\ndream. Nature hath deserted the connexion, and Art cannot supply her\r\nplace. For, as Milton wisely expresses, \"never can true reconcilement\r\ngrow where wounds of deadly hate have pierced so deep.\"\r\n\r\nEvery quiet method for peace hath been ineffectual. Our prayers\r\nhave been rejected with disdain; and only tended to convince us, that\r\nnothing flatters vanity, or confirms obstinacy in Kings more than\r\nrepeated petitioning--and noting hath contributed more than that very\r\nmeasure to make the Kings of Europe absolute: Witness Denmark and\r\nSweden. Wherefore, since nothing but blows will do, for God's sake,\r\nlet us come to a final separation, and not leave the next generation\r\nto be cutting throats, under the violated unmeaning names of parent\r\nand child.\r\n\r\nTo say, they will never attempt it again is idle and visionary, we\r\nthought so at the repeal of the stamp act, yet a year or two\r\nundeceived us; as well may we suppose that nations, which have been\r\nonce defeated, will never renew the quarrel.\r\n\r\nAs to government matters, it is not in the power of Britain to do\r\nthis continent justice: The business of it will soon be too weighty,\r\nand intricate, to be managed with any tolerable degree of\r\nconvenience, by a power, so distant from us, and so very ignorant of\r\nus; for if they cannot conquer us, they cannot govern us. To be\r\nalways running three or four thousand miles with a tale or a\r\npetition, waiting four or five months for an answer, which when\r\nobtained requires five or six more to explain it in, will in a few\r\nyears be looked upon as folly and childishness--There was a time when\r\nit was proper, and there is a proper time for it to cease.\r\n\r\nSmall islands not capable of protecting themselves, are the proper\r\nobjects for kingdoms to take under their care; but there is something\r\nvery absurd, in supposing a continent to be perpetually governed by\r\nan island. In no instance hath nature made the satellite larger than\r\nits primary planet, and as England and America, with respect to each\r\nother, reverses the common order of nature, it is evident they belong\r\nto different systems: England to Europe, America to itself.\r\n\r\nI am not induced by motives of pride, party, or resentment to\r\nespouse the doctrine of separation and independance; I am clearly,\r\npositively, and conscientiously persuaded that it is the true\r\ninterest of this continent to be so; that every thing short of THAT\r\nis mere patchwork, that it can afford no lasting felicity,--that it is\r\nleaving the sword to our children, and shrinking back at a time,\r\nwhen, a little more, a little farther, would have rendered this\r\ncontinent the glory of the earth.\r\n\r\nAs Britain hath not manifested the least inclination towards a\r\ncompromise, we may be assured that no terms can be obtained worthy\r\nthe acceptance of the continent, or any ways equal to the expense of\r\nblood and treasure we have been already put to.\r\n\r\nThe object, contended for, ought always to bear some just\r\nproportion to the expense. The removal of North, or the whole\r\ndetestable junto, is a matter unworthy the millions we have expended.\r\nA temporary stoppage of trade, was an inconvenience, which would have\r\nsufficiently ballanced the repeal of all the acts complained of, had\r\nsuch repeals been obtained; but if the whole continent must take up\r\narms, if every man must be a soldier, it is scarcely worth our while\r\nto fight against a contemptible ministry only. Dearly, dearly, do we\r\npay for the repeal of the acts, if that is all we fight for; for in a\r\njust estimation, it is as great a folly to pay a Bunker-hill price\r\nfor law, as for land. As I have always considered the independancy of\r\nthis continent, as an event, which sooner or later must arrive, so\r\nfrom the late rapid progress of the continent to maturity, the event\r\ncould not be far off. Wherefore, on the breaking out of hostilities,\r\nit was not worth the while to have disputed a matter, which time\r\nwould have finally redressed, unless we meant to be in earnest;\r\notherwise, it is like wasting an estate on a suit at law, to regulate\r\nthe trespasses of a tenant, whose lease is just expiring. No man was\r\na warmer wisher for reconciliation than myself, before the fatal\r\nnineteenth of April 1775,  but the moment the event of that day was\r\nmade known, I rejected the hardened, sullen tempered Pharaoh of\r\nEngland for ever; and disdain the wretch, that with the pretended\r\ntitle of FATHER OF HIS PEOPLE, can unfeelingly hear of their\r\nslaughter, and composedly sleep with their blood upon his soul.\r\n\r\nBut admitting that matters were now made up, what would be the\r\nevent? I answer, the ruin of the continent. And that for several\r\nreasons.\r\n\r\nFIRST. The powers of governing still remaining in the hands of\r\nthe king, he will have a negative over the whole legislation of this\r\ncontinent. And as he hath shewn himself such an inveterate enemy to\r\nliberty, and discovered such a thirst for arbitrary power; is he, or\r\nis he not, a proper man to say to these colonies, \"YOU SHALL MAKE NO\r\nLAWS BUT WHAT I PLEASE.\" And is there any inhabitant in America so\r\nignorant, as not to know, that according to what is called the\r\nPRESENT CONSTITUTION, that this continent can make no laws but what\r\nthe king gives it leave to; and is there any man so unwise, as not to\r\nsee, that (considering what has happened) he will suffer no law to be\r\nmade here, but such as suit HIS purpose. We may be as effectually\r\nenslaved by the want of laws in America, as by submitting to laws\r\nmade for us in England. After matters are made up (as it is called)\r\ncan there be any doubt, but the whole power of the crown will be\r\nexerted, to keep this continent as low and humble as possible?\r\nInstead of going forward we shall go backward, or be perpetually\r\nquarrelling or ridiculously petitioning. We are already greater than\r\nthe king wishes us to be, and will he not hereafter endeavour to make\r\nus less? To bring the matter to one point. Is the power who is\r\njealous of our prosperity, a proper power to govern us? Whoever says\r\nNO to this question is an INDEPENDANT, for independancy means no\r\nmore, than, whether we shall make our own laws, or, whether the king,\r\nthe greatest enemy this continent hath, or can have, shall tell us,\r\n\"THERE SHALL BE NO LAWS BUT SUCH AS I LIKE.\"\r\n\r\nBut the king you will say has a negative in England; the people\r\nthere can make no laws without his consent. In point of right and\r\ngood order, there is something very ridiculous, that a youth of\r\ntwenty-one (which hath often happened) shall say to several millions\r\nof people, older and wiser than himself, I forbid this or that act of\r\nyours to be law. But in this place I decline this sort of reply,\r\nthough I will never cease to expose the absurdity of it, and only\r\nanswer, that England being the King's residence, and America not so,\r\nmake quite another case. The king's negative HERE is ten times more\r\ndangerous and fatal than it can be in England, for THERE he will\r\nscarcely refuse his consent to a bill for putting England into as\r\nstrong a state of defence as possible, and in America he would never\r\nsuffer such a bill to be passed.\r\n\r\nAmerica is only a secondary object in the system of British\r\npolitics, England consults the good of THIS country, no farther\r\nthan it answers her OWN purpose. Wherefore, her own interest leads\r\nher to suppress the growth of OURS in every case which doth not\r\npromote her advantage, or in the least interferes with it. A pretty\r\nstate we should soon be in under such a second-hand government,\r\nconsidering what has happened! Men do not change from enemies to\r\nfriends by the alteration of a name: And in order to shew that\r\nreconciliation NOW is a dangerous doctrine, I affirm, THAT IT\r\nWOULD BE POLICY IN THE KING AT THIS TIME, TO REPEAL THE ACTS FOR THE\r\nSAKE OF REINSTATING HIMSELF IN THE GOVERNMENT OF THE PROVINCES; in\r\norder that HE MAY ACCOMPLISH BY CRAFT AND SUBTILITY, IN THE LONG RUN,\r\nWHAT HE CANNOT DO BY FORCE AND VIOLENCE IN THE SHORT ONE.\r\nReconciliation and ruin are nearly related.\r\n\r\nSECONDLY. That as even the best terms, which we can expect to\r\nobtain, can amount to no more than a temporary expedient, or a kind\r\nof government by guardianship, which can last no longer than till the\r\ncolonies come of age, so the general face and state of things, in the\r\ninterim, will be unsettled and unpromising. Emigrants of property\r\nwill not choose to come to a country whose form of government hangs\r\nbut by a thread, and who is every day tottering on the brink of\r\ncommotion and disturbance; and numbers of the present inhabitants\r\nwould lay hold of the interval, to dispose of their effects, and quit\r\nthe continent.\r\n\r\nBut the most powerful of all arguments, is, that nothing but\r\nindependance, i. e. a continental form of government, can keep the\r\npeace of the continent and preserve it inviolate from civil wars. I\r\ndread the event of a reconciliation with Britain now, as it is more\r\nthan probable, that it will followed by a revolt somewhere or other,\r\nthe consequences of which may be far more fatal than all the malice\r\nof Britain.\r\n\r\nThousands are already ruined by British barbarity; (thousands more\r\nwill probably suffer the same fate.) Those men have other feelings\r\nthan us who have nothing suffered. All they NOW possess is liberty,\r\nwhat they before enjoyed is sacrificed to its service, and having\r\nnothing more to lose, they disdain submission. Besides, the general\r\ntemper of the colonies, towards a British government, will be like\r\nthat of a youth, who is nearly out of his time; they will care very\r\nlittle about her. And a government which cannot preserve the peace,\r\nis no government at all, and in that case we pay our money for\r\nnothing; and pray what is it that Britain can do, whose power will be\r\nwholly on paper, should a civil tumult break out the very day after\r\nreconciliation? I have heard some men say, many of whom I believe\r\nspoke without thinking, that they dreaded an independance, fearing\r\nthat it would produce civil wars. It is but seldom that our first\r\nthoughts are truly correct, and that is the case here; for there are\r\nten times more to dread from a patched up connexion than from\r\nindependance. I make the sufferers case my own, and I protest, that\r\nwere I driven from house and home, my property destroyed, and my\r\ncircumstances ruined, that as a man, sensible of injuries, I could\r\nnever relish the doctrine of reconciliation, or consider myself bound\r\nthereby.\r\n\r\nThe colonies have manifested such a spirit of good order and\r\nobedience to continental government, as is sufficient to make every\r\nreasonable person easy and happy on that head. No man can assign the\r\nleast pretence for his fears, on any other grounds, that such as are\r\ntruly childish and ridiculous, viz. that one colony will be striving\r\nfor superiority over another.\r\n\r\nWhere there are no distinctions there can be no superiority,\r\nperfect equality affords no temptation. The republics of Europe are\r\nall (and we may say always) in peace. Holland and Swisserland are\r\nwithout wars, foreign or domestic: Monarchical governments, it is\r\ntrue, are never long at rest; the crown itself is a temptation to\r\nenterprizing ruffians at HOME; and that degree of pride and\r\ninsolence ever attendant on regal authority, swells into a rupture\r\nwith foreign powers, in instances, where a republican government, by\r\nbeing formed on more natural principles, would negotiate the mistake.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf there is any true cause of fear respecting independance, it is\r\nbecause no plan is yet laid down. Men do not see their way\r\nout--Wherefore, as an opening into that business, I offer the\r\nfollowing hints; at the same time modestly affirming, that I have no\r\nother opinion of them myself, than that they may be the means of\r\ngiving rise to something better. Could the straggling thoughts of\r\nindividuals be collected, they would frequently form materials for\r\nwise and able men to improve into useful matter.\r\n\r\nLet the assemblies be annual, with a President only. The\r\nrepresentation more equal. Their business wholly domestic, and\r\nsubject to the authority of a Continental Congress.\r\n\r\nLet each colony be divided into six, eight, or ten, convenient\r\ndistricts, each district to send a proper number of delegates to\r\nCongress, so that each colony send at least thirty. The whole number\r\nin Congress will be least 390. Each Congress to sit and to choose\r\na president by the following method. When the delegates are met, let\r\na colony be taken from the whole thirteen colonies by lot, after\r\nwhich, let the whole Congress choose (by ballot) a president from out\r\nof the delegates of THAT province. In the next Congress, let a\r\ncolony be taken by lot from twelve only, omitting that colony from\r\nwhich the president was taken in the former Congress, and so\r\nproceeding on till the whole thirteen shall have had their proper\r\nrotation. And in order that nothing may pass into a law but what is\r\nsatisfactorily just, not less than three fifths of the Congress to be\r\ncalled a majority. He that will promote discord, under a government\r\nso equally formed as this, would have joined Lucifer in his revolt.\r\n\r\nBut as there is a peculiar delicacy, from whom, or in what manner,\r\nthis business must first arise, and as it seems most agreeable and\r\nconsistent that it should come from some intermediate body between\r\nthe governed and the governors, that is, between the Congress and the\r\npeople, let a CONTINENTAL CONFERENCE be held, in the following\r\nmanner, and for the following purpose.\r\n\r\nA committee of twenty-six members of Congress, viz. two for each\r\ncolony. Two members for each House of Assembly, or Provincial\r\nConvention; and five representatives of the people at large, to be\r\nchosen in the capital city or town of each province, for, and in\r\nbehalf of the whole province, by as many qualified voters as shall\r\nthink proper to attend from all parts of the province for that\r\npurpose; or, if more convenient, the representatives may be chosen in\r\ntwo or three of the most populous parts thereof. In this conference,\r\nthus assembled, will be united, the two grand principles of business,\r\nKNOWLEDGE and POWER. The members of Congress, Assemblies, or\r\nConventions, by having had experience in national concerns, will be\r\nable and useful counsellors, and the whole, being impowered by the\r\npeople, will have a truly legal authority.\r\n\r\nThe conferring members being met, let their business be to frame a\r\nCONTINENTAL CHARTER, or Charter of the United Colonies; (answering to\r\nwhat is called the Magna Charta of England) fixing the number and\r\nmanner of choosing members of Congress, members of Assembly, with\r\ntheir date of sitting, and drawing the line of business and\r\njurisdiction between them: (Always remembering, that our strength is\r\ncontinental, not provincial:) Securing freedom and property to all\r\nmen, and above all things, the free exercise of religion, according\r\nto the dictates of conscience; with such other matter as is necessary\r\nfor a charter to contain. Immediately after which, the said\r\nConference to dissolve, and the bodies which shall be chosen\r\ncomformable to the said charter, to be the legislators and governors\r\nof this continent for the time being: Whose peace and happiness, may\r\nGod preserve, Amen.\r\n\r\nShould any body of men be hereafter delegated for this or some\r\nsimilar purpose, I offer them the following extracts from that wise\r\nobserver on governments DRAGONETTI. \"The science\" says he \"of the\r\npolitician consists in fixing the true point of happiness and\r\nfreedom. Those men would deserve the gratitude of ages, who should\r\ndiscover a mode of government that contained the greatest sum of\r\nindividual happiness, with the least national expense.\" \"DRAGONETTI\r\nON VIRTUE AND REWARDS.\"\r\n\r\nBut where says some is the King of America? I'll tell you Friend,\r\nhe reigns above, and doth not make havoc of mankind like the Royal\r\nBrute of Britain. Yet that we may not appear to be defective even in\r\nearthly honors, let a day be solemnly set apart for proclaiming the\r\ncharter; let it be brought forth placed on the divine law, the word\r\nof God; let a crown be placed thereon, by which the world may know,\r\nthat so far as we approve as monarchy, that in America THE LAW IS\r\nKING. For as in absolute governments the King is law, so in free\r\ncountries the law OUGHT to be King; and there ought to be no other.\r\nBut lest any ill use should afterwards arise, let the crown at the\r\nconclusion of the ceremony be demolished, and scattered among the\r\npeople whose right it is.\r\n\r\nA government of our own is our natural right: And when a man\r\nseriously reflects on the precariousness of human affairs, he will\r\nbecome convinced, that it is infinitely wiser and safer, to form a\r\nconstitution of our own in a cool deliberate manner, while we have it\r\nin our power, than to trust such an interesting event to time and\r\nchance. If we omit it now, some, [*1] Massanello may hereafter arise,\r\nwho laying hold of popular disquietudes, may collect together the\r\ndesperate and discontented, and by assuming to themselves the powers\r\nof government, may sweep away the liberties of the continent like a\r\ndeluge. Should the government of America return again into the hands\r\nof Britain, the tottering situation of things, will be a temptation\r\nfor some desperate adventurer to try his fortune; and in such a case,\r\nwhat relief can Britain give? Ere she could hear the news, the fatal\r\nbusiness might be done; and ourselves suffering like the wretched\r\nBritons under the oppression of the Conqueror. Ye that oppose\r\nindependance now, ye know not what ye do; ye are opening a door to\r\neternal tyranny, by keeping vacant the seat of government. There are\r\nthousands, and tens of thousands, who would think it glorious to\r\nexpel from the continent, that barbarous and hellish power, which\r\nhath stirred up the Indians and Negroes to destroy us, the cruelty\r\nhath a double guilt, it is dealing brutally by us, and treacherously\r\nby them.\r\n\r\nTo talk of friendship with those in whom our reason forbids us to\r\nhave faith, and our affections wounded through a thousand pores\r\ninstruct us to detest, is madness and folly. Every day wears out the\r\nlittle remains of kindred between us and them, and can there be any\r\nreason to hope, that as the relationship expires, the affection will\r\nincrease, or that we shall agree better, when we have ten times more\r\nand greater concerns to quarrel over than ever?\r\n\r\nYe that tell us of harmony and reconciliation, can ye restore to us\r\nthe time that is past? Can ye give to prostitution its former\r\ninnocence? Neither can ye reconcile Britain and America. The last\r\ncord now is broken, the people of England are presenting addresses\r\nagainst us. There are injuries which nature cannot forgive; she would\r\ncease to be nature if she did. As well can the lover forgive the\r\nravisher of his mistress, as the continent forgive the murders of\r\nBritain. The Almighty hath implanted in us these unextinguishable\r\nfeelings for good and wise purposes. They are the guardians of his\r\nimage in our hearts. They distinguish us from the herd of common\r\nanimals. The social compact would dissolve, and justice be extirpated\r\nfrom the earth, or have only a casual existence were we callous to\r\nthe touches of affection. The robber, and the murderer, would often\r\nescape unpunished, did not the injuries which our tempers sustain,\r\nprovoke us into justice.\r\n\r\nO ye that love mankind! Ye that dare oppose, not only the tyranny,\r\nbut the tyrant, stand forth! Every spot of the old world is overrun\r\nwith oppression. Freedom hath been hunted round the globe. Asia, and\r\nAfrica, have long expelled her. Europe regards her like a stranger,\r\nand England hath given her warning to depart. O! receive the\r\nfugitive, and prepare in time an asylum for mankind.\r\n\r\nNote 1  Thomas Anello, otherwise Massanello, a fisherman of Naples,\r\nwho after spiriting up his countrymen in the public market place,\r\nagainst the oppression of the Spaniards, to whom the place was then\r\nsubject, prompted them to revolt, and in the space of a day became\r\nking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE PRESENT ABILITY OF AMERICA, WITH SOME MISCELLANEOUS REFLEXIONS\r\n\r\nI HAVE never met with a man, either in England or America, who hath\r\nnot confessed his opinion, that a separation between the countries,\r\nwould take place one time or other: And there is no instance, in\r\nwhich we have shewn less judgment, than in endeavouring to describe,\r\nwhat we call, the ripeness or fitness of the Continent for\r\nindependance.\r\n\r\nAs all men allow the measure, and vary only in their opinion of the\r\ntime, let us, in order to remove mistakes, take a general survey of\r\nthings, and endeavour, if possible, to find out the VERY time. But\r\nwe need not go far, the inquiry ceases at once, for, the TIME HATH\r\nFOUND US. The general concurrence, the glorious union of all things\r\nprove the fact.\r\n\r\nIt is not in numbers, but in unity, that our great strength lies;\r\nyet our present numbers are sufficient to repel the force of all the\r\nworld. The Continent hath, at this time, the largest body of armed\r\nand disciplined men of any power under Heaven; and is just arrived at\r\nthat pitch of strength, in which, no single colony is able to support\r\nitself, and the whole, when united, can accomplish the matter, and\r\neither more, or, less than this, might be fatal in its effects. Our\r\nland force is already sufficient, and as to naval affairs, we cannot\r\nbe insensible, that Britain would never suffer an American man of war\r\nto be built, while the continent remained in her hands. Wherefore, we\r\nshould be no forwarder an hundred years hence in that branch, than we\r\nare now; but the truth is, we should be less so, because the timber\r\nof the country is every day diminishing, and that, which will remain\r\nat last, will be far off and difficult to procure.\r\n\r\nWere the continent crowded with inhabitants, her sufferings under\r\nthe present circumstances would be intolerable. The more sea port\r\ntowns we had, the more should we have both to defend and to loose.\r\nOur present numbers are so happily proportioned to our wants, that no\r\nman need be idle. The diminution of trade affords an army, and the\r\nnecessities of an army create a new trade.\r\n\r\nDebts we have none; and whatever we may contract on this account\r\nwill serve as a glorious memento of our virtue. Can we but leave\r\nposterity with a settled form of government, an independant\r\nconstitution of it's own, the purchase at any price will be cheap.\r\nBut to expend millions for the sake of getting a few vile acts\r\nrepealed, and routing the present ministry only, is unworthy the\r\ncharge, and is using posterity with the utmost cruelty; because it is\r\nleaving them the great work to do, and a debt upon their backs, from\r\nwhich, they derive no advantage. Such a thought is unworthy a man of\r\nhonor, and is the true characteristic of a narrow heart and a pedling\r\npolitician.\r\n\r\nThe debt we may contract doth not deserve our regard if the work be\r\nbut accomplished. No nation ought to be without a debt. A national\r\ndebt is a national bond; and when it bears no interest, is in no case\r\na grievance. Britain is oppressed with a debt of upwards of one\r\nhundred and forty millions sterling, for which she pays upwards of\r\nfour millions interest. And as a compensation for her debt, she has a\r\nlarge navy; America is without a debt, and without a navy; yet for\r\nthe twentieth part of the English national debt, could have a navy as\r\nlarge again. The navy of England is not worth, at this time, more\r\nthan three millions and an half sterling.\r\n\r\nThe first and second editions of this pamphlet were published\r\nwithout the following calculations, which are now given as a proof\r\nthat the above estimation of the navy is a just one.

Tar, timber, iron, and cordage\r\nare her natural produce. We need go abroad for nothing. Whereas the\r\nDutch, who make large profits by hiring out their ships of war to the\r\nSpaniards and Portuguese, are obliged to import most of the materials\r\nthey use. We ought to view the building a fleet as an article of\r\ncommerce, it being the natural manufactory of this country. It is the\r\nbest money we can lay out. A navy when finished is worth more than it\r\ncost. And is that nice point in national policy, in which commerce\r\nand protection are united. Let us build; if we want them not, we can\r\nsell; and by that means replace our paper currency with ready gold\r\nand silver.\r\n\r\nIn point of manning a fleet, people in general run into great\r\nerrors; it is not necessary that one fourth part should be sailor.\r\nThe Terrible privateer, Captain Death, stood the hottest engagement\r\nof any ship last war, yet had not twenty sailors on board, though her\r\ncomplement of men was upwards of two hundred. A few able and social\r\nsailors will soon instruct a sufficient number of active landmen in\r\nthe common work of a ship. Wherefore, we never can be more capable to\r\nbegin on maritime matters than now, while our timber is standing, our\r\nfisheries blocked up, and our sailors and shipwrights out of employ.\r\nMen of war, of seventy and eighty guns were built forty years ago in\r\nNew England, and why not the same now? Ship-building is America's\r\ngreatest pride, and in which, she will in time excel the whole world.\r\nThe great empires of the east are mostly inland, and consequently\r\nexcluded from the possibility of rivalling her. Africa is in a state\r\nof barbarism; and no power in Europe, hath either such an extent of\r\ncoast, or such an internal supply of materials. Where nature hath\r\ngiven the one, she has withheld the other; to America only hath she\r\nbeen liberal of both. The vast empire of Russia is almost shut out\r\nfrom the sea; wherefore, her boundless forests, her tar, iron, and\r\ncordage are only articles of commerce.\r\n\r\nIn point of safety, ought we to be without a fleet? We are not the\r\nlittle people now, which we were sixty years ago; at that time we\r\nmight have trusted our property in the streets, or fields rather; and\r\nslept securely without locks or bolts to our doors or windows. The\r\ncase now is altered, and our methods of defence, ought to improve\r\nwith our increase of property. A common pirate, twelve months ago,\r\nmight have come up the Delaware, and laid the city of Philadelphia\r\nunder instant contribution, for what sum he pleased; and the same\r\nmight have happened to other places. Nay, any daring fellow, in a\r\nbrig of fourteen or sixteen guns, might have robbed the whole\r\nContinent, and carried off half a million of money. These are\r\ncircumstances which demand our attention, and point out the necessity\r\nof naval protection.\r\n\r\nSome, perhaps, will say, that after we have made it up with\r\nBritain, she will protect us. Can we be so unwise as to mean, that\r\nshe shall keep a navy in our harbours for that purpose? Common sense\r\nwill tell us, that the power which hath endeavoured to subdue us, is\r\nof all others, the most improper to defend us. Conquest may be\r\neffected under the pretence of friendship; and ourselves, after a\r\nlong and brave resistance, be at last cheated into slavery. And if\r\nher ships are not to be admitted into our harbours, I would ask, how\r\nis she to protect us? A navy three or four thousand miles off can be\r\nof little use, and on sudden emergencies, none at all. Wherefore, if\r\nwe must hereafter protect ourselves, why not do it for ourselves? Why\r\ndo it for another?\r\n\r\nThe English list of ships of war, is long and formidable, but not a\r\ntenth part of them are at any time fit for service, numbers of them\r\nnot in being; yet their names are pompously continued in the list, if\r\nonly a plank be left of the ship: and not a fifth part, of such as\r\nare fit for service, can be spared on any one station at one time.\r\nThe East, and West Indies, Mediterranean, Africa, and other parts\r\nover which Britain extends her claim, make large demands upon her\r\nnavy. From a mixture of prejudice and inattention, we have contracted\r\na false notion respecting the navy of England, and have talked as if\r\nwe should have the whole of it to encounter at once, and for that\r\nreason, supposed, that we must have one as large; which not being\r\ninstantly practicable, have been made use of by a set of disguised\r\nTories to discourage our beginning thereon. Nothing can be farther\r\nfrom truth than this; for if America had only a twentieth part of the\r\nnaval force of Britain, she would be by far an over match for her;\r\nbecause, as we neither have, nor claim any foreign dominion, our\r\nwhole force would be employed on our own coast, where we should, in\r\nthe long run, have two to one the advantage of those who had three or\r\nfour thousand miles to sail over, before they could attack us, and\r\nthe same distance to return in order to refit and recruit. And\r\nalthough Britain by her fleet, hath a check over our trade to Europe,\r\nwe have as large a one over her trade to the West Indies, which, by\r\nlaying in the neighbourhood of the Continent, is entirely at its\r\nmercy.\r\n\r\nSome method might be fallen on to keep up a naval force in time of\r\npeace, if we should not judge it necessary to support a constant\r\nnavy. If premiums were to be given to merchants, to build and employ\r\nin their service, ships mounted with twenty, thirty, forty, or fifty\r\nguns, (the premiums to be in proportion to the loss of bulk to the\r\nmerchants) fifty or sixty of those ships, with a few guard ships on\r\nconstant duty, would keep up a sufficient navy, and that without\r\nburdening ourselves with the evil so loudly complained of in England,\r\nof suffering their fleet, in time of peace to lie rotting in the\r\ndocks. To unite the sinews of commerce and defence is sound policy;\r\nfor when our strength and our riches, play into each other's hand, we\r\nneed fear no external enemy.\r\n\r\nIn almost every article of defence we abound. Hemp flourishes even\r\nto rankness, so that we need not want cordage. Our iron is superior\r\nto that of other countries. Our small arms equal to any in the world.\r\nCannons we can cast at pleasure. Saltpetre and gunpowder we are every\r\nday producing. Our knowledge is hourly improving. Resolution is our\r\ninherent character, and courage hath never yet forsaken us.\r\nWherefore, what is it that we want? Why is it that we hesitate? From\r\nBritain we can expect nothing but ruin. If she is once admitted to\r\nthe government of America again, this Continent will not be worth\r\nliving in. Jealousies will be always arising; insurrections will be\r\nconstantly happening; and who will go forth to quell them? Who will\r\nventure his life to reduce his own countrymen to a foreign obedience?\r\nThe difference between Pennsylvania and Connecticut, respecting some\r\nunlocated lands, shews the insignificance of a British government,\r\nand fully proves, that nothing but Continental authority can regulate\r\nContinental matters.\r\n\r\nAnother reason why the present time is preferable to all others,\r\nis, that the fewer our numbers are, the more land there is yet\r\nunoccupied, which instead of being lavished by the king on his\r\nworthless dependents, may be hereafter applied, not only to the\r\ndischarge of the present debt, but to the constant support of\r\ngovernment. No nation under heaven hath such an advantage as this.\r\n\r\nThe infant state of the Colonies, as it is called, so far from\r\nbeing against, is an argument in favor of independance. We are\r\nsufficiently numerous, and were we more so, we might be less united.\r\nIt is a matter worthy of observation, that the more a country is\r\npeopled, the smaller their armies are. In military numbers, the\r\nancients far exceeded the moderns: and the reason is evident, for\r\ntrade being the consequence of population, men become too much\r\nabsorbed thereby to attend to any thing else. Commerce diminishes the\r\nspirit, both of patriotism and military defence. And history\r\nsufficiently informs us, that the bravest achievements were always\r\naccomplished in the non age of a nation. With the increase of\r\ncommerce, England hath lost its spirit. The city of London,\r\nnotwithstanding its numbers, submits to continued insults with the\r\npatience of a coward. The more men have to lose, the less willing are\r\nthey to venture. The rich are in general slaves to fear, and submit\r\nto courtly power with the trembling duplicity of a Spaniel.\r\n\r\nYouth is the seed time of good habits, as well in nations as in\r\nindividuals. It might be difficult, if not impossible, to form the\r\nContinent into one government half a century hence. The vast variety\r\nof interests, occasioned by an increase of trade and population,\r\nwould create confusion. Colony would be against colony. Each being\r\nable might scorn each other's assistance; and while the proud and\r\nfoolish gloried in their little distinctions, the wise would lament,\r\nthat the union had not been formed before. Wherefore, the PRESENT\r\nTIME is the TRUE TIME for establishing it. The intimacy which is\r\ncontracted in infancy, and the friendship which is formed in\r\nmisfortune, are, of all others, the most lasting and unalterable. Our\r\npresent union is marked with both these characters: we are young, and\r\nwe have been distressed; but our concord hath withstood our troubles,\r\nand fixes a memorable area for posterity to glory in.\r\n\r\nThe present time, likewise, is that peculiar time, which never\r\nhappens to a nation but once, VIZ. the time of forming itself into\r\na government. Most nations have let slip the opportunity, and by that\r\nmeans have been compelled to receive laws from their conquerors,\r\ninstead of making laws for themselves. First, they had a king, and\r\nthen a form of government; whereas, the articles or charter of\r\ngovernment, should be formed first, and men delegated to execute them\r\nafterwards: but from the errors of other nations, let us learn\r\nwisdom, and lay hold of the present opportunity--TO BEGIN GOVERNMENT\r\nAT THE RIGHT END.\r\n\r\nWhen William the Conqueror subdued England, he gave them law at the\r\npoint of the sword; and until we consent, that the seat of\r\ngovernment, in America, be legally and authoritatively occupied, we\r\nshall be in danger of having it filled by some fortunate ruffian, who\r\nmay treat us in the same manner, and then, where will be our freedom?\r\nWhere our property?\r\n\r\nAs to religion, I hold it to be the indispensible duty of all\r\ngovernment, to protect all conscientious professors thereof, and I\r\nknow of no other business which government hath to do therewith. Let\r\na man throw aside that narrowness of soul, that selfishness of\r\nprinciple, which the niggards of all professions are so unwilling to\r\npart with, and he will be at once delivered of his fears on that\r\nhead. Suspicion is the companion of mean souls, and the bane of all\r\ngood society. For myself, I fully and conscientiously believe, that\r\nit is the will of the Almighty, that there should be diversity of\r\nreligious opinions among us: It affords a larger field for our\r\nChristian kindness. Were we all of one way of thinking, our religious\r\ndispositions would want matter for probation; and on this liberal\r\nprinciple, I look on the various denominations among us, to be like\r\nchildren of the same family, differing only, in what is called, their\r\nChristian names.\r\n\r\nIn page [III par 47], I threw out a few thoughts on\r\nthe propriety of a Continental Charter, (for I only presume to offer\r\nhints, not plans) and in this place, I take the liberty of\r\nrementioning the subject, by observing, that a charter is to be\r\nunderstood as a bond of solemn obligation, which the whole enters\r\ninto, to support the right of every separate part, whether or\r\nreligion, personal freedom, or property. A firm bargain and a right\r\nreckoning make long friends.\r\n\r\nIn a former page I likewise mentioned the necessity of a large and\r\nequal representation; and there is no political matter which more\r\ndeserves our attention. A small number of electors, or a small number\r\nof representatives, are equally dangerous. But if the number of the\r\nrepresentatives be not only small, but unequal, the danger is\r\nincreased. As an instance of this, I mention the following; when the\r\nAssociators petition was before the House of Assembly of\r\nPennsylvania; twenty-eight members only were present, all the Bucks\r\ncounty members, being eight, voted against it, and had seven of the\r\nChester members done the same, this whole province had been governed\r\nby two counties only, and this danger it is always exposed to. The\r\nunwarrantable stretch likewise, which that house made in their last\r\nsitting, to gain an undue authority over the Delegates of that\r\nprovince, ought to warn the people at large, how they trust power out\r\nof their own hands. A set of instructions for the Delegates were put\r\ntogether, which in point of sense and business would have dishonored\r\na schoolboy, and after being approved by a FEW, a VERY FEW\r\nwithout doors, were carried into the House, and there passed IN\r\nBEHALF OF THE WHOLE COLONY; whereas, did the whole colony know, with\r\nwhat ill-will that House hath entered on some necessary public\r\nmeasures, they would not hesitate a moment to think them unworthy of\r\nsuch a trust.\r\n\r\nImmediate necessity makes many things convenient, which if\r\ncontinued would grow into oppressions. Expedience and right are\r\ndifferent things. When the calamities of America required a\r\nconsultation, there was no method so ready, or at that time so\r\nproper, as to appoint persons from the several Houses of Assembly for\r\nthat purpose; and the wisdom with which they have proceeded hath\r\npreserved this continent from ruin. But as it is more than probable\r\nthat we shall never be without a CONGRESS, every well wisher to good\r\norder, must own, that the mode for choosing members of that body,\r\ndeserves consideration. And I put it as a question to those, who make\r\na study of mankind, whether REPRESENTATION AND ELECTION is not too\r\ngreat a power for one and the same body of men to possess? When we\r\nare planning for posterity, we ought to remember, that virtue is not\r\nhereditary.\r\n\r\nIt is from our enemies that we often gain excellent maxims, and are\r\nfrequently surprised into reason by their mistakes. Mr. Cornwall (one\r\nof the Lords of the Treasury) treated the petition of the New York\r\nAssembly with contempt, because THAT House, he said, consisted but\r\nof twenty-six members, which trifling number, he argued, could not\r\nwith decency be put for the whole. We thank him for his involuntary\r\nhonesty. [*Note 1]\r\n\r\nTO CONCLUDE, however strange it may appear to some, or however\r\nunwilling they may be to think so, matters not, but many strong and\r\nstriking reasons may be given, to shew, that nothing can settle our\r\naffairs so expeditiously as an open and determined declaration for\r\nindependance. Some of which are,\r\n\r\nFIRST--It is the custom of nations, when any two are at war, for\r\nsome other powers, not engaged in the quarrel, to step in as\r\nmediators, and bring about the preliminaries of a peace: but while\r\nAmerica calls herself the Subject of Great Britain, no power, however\r\nwell disposed she may be, can offer her mediation. Wherefore, in our\r\npresent state we may quarrel on for ever.\r\n\r\nSECONDLY--It is unreasonable to suppose, that France or Spain\r\nwill give us any kind of assistance, if we mean only, to make use of\r\nthat assistance for the purpose of repairing the breach, and\r\nstrengthening the connection between Britain and America; because,\r\nthose powers would be sufferers by the consequences.\r\n\r\nTHIRDLY--While we profess ourselves the subjects of Britain, we\r\nmust, in the eye of foreign nations, be considered as rebels. The\r\nprecedent is somewhat dangerous to THEIR PEACE, for men to be in\r\narms under the name of subjects; we, on the spot, can solve the\r\nparadox: but to unite resistance and subjection, requires an idea\r\nmuch too refined for the common understanding.\r\n\r\nFOURTHLY--Were a manifesto to be published, and despatched to\r\nforeign courts, setting forth the miseries we have endured, and the\r\npeaceable methods we have ineffectually used for redress; declaring,\r\nat the same time, that not being able, any longer, to live happily or\r\nsafely under the cruel disposition of the British court, we had been\r\ndriven to the necessity of breaking off all connections with her; at\r\nthe same time, assuring all such courts of our peacable disposition\r\ntowards them, and of our desire of entering into trade with them:\r\nSuch a memorial would produce more good effects to this Continent,\r\nthan if a ship were freighted with petitions to Britain.\r\n\r\nUnder our present denomination of British subjects, we can neither\r\nbe received nor heard abroad: The custom of all courts is against us,\r\nand will be so, until, by an independance, we take rank with other\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nThese proceedings may at first appear strange and difficult; but,\r\nlike all other steps which we have already passed over, will in a\r\nlittle time become familiar and agreeable; and, until an independance\r\nis declared, the Continent will feel itself like a man who continues\r\nputting off some unpleasant business from day to day, yet knows it\r\nmust be done, hates to set about it, wishes it over, and is\r\ncontinually haunted with the thoughts of its necessity.\r\n\r\nNote 1  Those who would fully understand of what great consequence a\r\nlarge and equal representation is to a state, should read Burgh's\r\npolitical Disquisitions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          APPENDIX\r\n\r\nSINCE the publication of the first edition of this pamphlet, or\r\nrather, on the same day on which it came out, the King's Speech made\r\nits appearance in this city. Had the spirit of prophecy directed the\r\nbirth of this production, it could not have brought it forth, at a\r\nmore seasonable juncture, or a more necessary time. The bloody\r\nmindedness of the one, shew the necessity of pursuing the doctrine of\r\nthe other. Men read by way of revenge. And the Speech instead of\r\nterrifying, prepared a way for the manly principles of Independance.\r\n\r\n\r\nCeremony, and even, silence, from whatever motive they may arise,\r\nhave a hurtful tendency, when they give the least degree of\r\ncountenance to base and wicked performances; wherefore, if this maxim\r\nbe admitted, it naturally follows, that the King's Speech, as being a\r\npiece of finished villany, deserved, and still deserves, a general\r\nexecration both by the Congress and the people. Yet, as the domestic\r\ntranquillity of a nation, depends greatly, on the CHASTITY of what\r\nmay properly be called NATIONAL MANNERS, it is often better, to pass\r\nsome things over in silent disdain, than to make use of such new\r\nmethods of dislike, as might introduce the least innovation, on that\r\nguardian of our peace and safety. And, perhaps, it is chiefly owing\r\nto this prudent delicacy, that the King's Speech, hath not, before\r\nnow, suffered a public execution. The Speech if it may be called one,\r\nis nothing better than a wilful audacious libel against the truth,\r\nthe common good, and the existence of mankind; and is a formal and\r\npompous method of offering up human sacrifices to the pride of\r\ntyrants. But this general massacre of mankind, is one of the\r\nprivileges, and the certain consequence of Kings; for as nature knows\r\nthem NOT, they know NOT HER, and although they are beings of our\r\nOWN creating, they know not US, and are become the gods of their\r\ncreators. The Speech hath one good quality, which is, that it is not\r\ncalculated to deceive, neither can we, even if we would, be deceived\r\nby it. Brutality and tyranny appear on the face of it. It leaves us\r\nat no loss: And every line convinces, even in the moment of reading,\r\nthat He, who hunts the woods for prey, the naked and untutored\r\nIndian, is less a Savage than the King of Britain.\r\n\r\nSir John Dalrymple, the putative father of a whining jesuitical\r\npiece, fallaciously called, \"THE ADDRESS OF THE PEOPLE OF ENGLAND\r\nTO THE INHABITANTS OF AMERICA,\" hath, perhaps, from a vain\r\nsupposition, that the people HERE were to be frightened at the pomp\r\nand description of a king, given, (though very unwisely on his part)\r\nthe real character of the present one: \"But,\" says this writer, \"if\r\nyou are inclined to pay compliments to an administration, which we do\r\nnot complain of,\" (meaning the Marquis of Rockingham's at the repeal\r\nof the Stamp Act) \"it is very unfair in you to withhold them from\r\nthat prince, BY WHOSE NOD ALONE THEY WERE PERMITTED TO DO ANY\r\nTHING.\" This is toryism with a witness! Here is idolatry even\r\nwithout a mask: And he who can so calmly hear, and digest such\r\ndoctrine, hath forfeited his claim to rationality--an apostate from\r\nthe order of manhood; and ought to be considered--as one, who hath,\r\nnot only given up the proper dignity of a man, but sunk himself\r\nbeneath the rank of animals, and contemptibly crawls through the\r\nworld like a worm.\r\n\r\nHowever, it matters very little now, what the king of England\r\neither says or does; he hath wickedly broken through every moral and\r\nhuman obligation, trampled nature and conscience beneath his feet;\r\nand by a steady and constitutional spirit of insolence and cruelty,\r\nprocured for himself an universal hatred. It is NOW the interest of\r\nAmerica to provide for herself. She hath already a large and young\r\nfamily, whom it is more her duty to take care of, than to be granting\r\naway her property, to support a power who is become a reproach to the\r\nnames of men and christians--YE, whose office it is to watch over the\r\nmorals of a nation, of whatsoever sect or denomination ye are of, as\r\nwell as ye, who, are more immediately the guardians of the public\r\nliberty, if ye wish to preserve your native country uncontaminated by\r\nEuropean corruption, ye must in secret wish a separation--But leaving\r\nthe moral part to private reflection, I shall chiefly confine my\r\nfarther remarks to the following heads.\r\n\r\nFirst, That it is the interest of America to be separated from\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\nSecondly, Which is the easiest and most practicable plan,\r\nRECONCILIATION or INDEPENDANCE? with some occasional remarks.\r\n\r\nIn support of the first, I could, if I judged it proper, produce\r\nthe opinion of some of the ablest and most experienced men on this\r\ncontinent; and whose sentiments, on that head, are not yet publicly\r\nknown. It is in reality a self-evident position: For no nation in a\r\nstate of foreign dependance, limited in its commerce, and cramped and\r\nfettered in its legislative powers, can ever arrive at any material\r\neminence. America doth not yet know what opulence is; and although\r\nthe progress which she hath made stands unparalleled in the history\r\nof other nations, it is but childhood, compared with what she would\r\nbe capable of arriving at, had she, as she ought to have, the\r\nlegislative powers in her own hands. England is, at this time,\r\nproudly coveting what would do her no good, were she to accomplish\r\nit; and the Continent hesitating on a matter, which will be her final\r\nruin if neglected. It is the commerce and not the conquest of\r\nAmerica, by which England is to be benefited, and that would in a\r\ngreat measure continue, were the countries as independant of each\r\nother as France and Spain; because in many articles, neither can go\r\nto a better market. But it is the independance of this country of\r\nBritain or any other, which is now the main and only object worthy of\r\ncontention, and which, like all other truths discovered by necessity,\r\nwill appear clearer and stronger every day.\r\n\r\nFirst, Because it will come to that one time or other.\r\n\r\nSecondly, Because, the longer it is delayed the harder it will be\r\nto accomplish.\r\n\r\nI have frequently amused myself both in public and private\r\ncompanies, with silently remarking, the specious errors of those who\r\nspeak without reflecting. And among the many which I have heard, the\r\nfollowing seems most general, viz. that had this rupture happened\r\nforty or fifty years hence, instead of NOW, the Continent would\r\nhave been more able to have shaken off the dependance. To which I\r\nreply, that our military ability AT THIS TIME, arises from the\r\nexperience gained in the last war, and which in forty or fifty years\r\ntime, would have been totally extinct. The Continent, would not, by\r\nthat time, have had a General, or even a military officer left; and\r\nwe, or those who may succeed us, would have been as ignorant of\r\nmartial matters as the ancient Indians: And this single position,\r\nclosely attended to, will unanswerably prove, that the present time\r\nis preferable to all others. The argument turns thus--at the\r\nconclusion of the last war, we had experience, but wanted numbers;\r\nand forty or fifty years hence, we should have numbers, without\r\nexperience; wherefore, the proper point of time, must be some\r\nparticular point between the two extremes, in which a sufficiency of\r\nthe former remains, and a proper increase of the latter is obtained:\r\nAnd that point of time is the present time.\r\n\r\nThe reader will pardon this digression, as it does not properly\r\ncome under the head I first set out with, and to which I again return\r\nby the following position, viz.\r\n\r\nShould affairs be patched up with Britain, and she to remain the\r\ngoverning and sovereign power of America, (which, as matters are now\r\ncircumstanced, is giving up the point intirely) we shall deprive\r\nourselves of the very means of sinking the debt we have, or may\r\ncontract. The value of the back lands which some of the provinces are\r\nclandestinely deprived of, by the unjust extension of the limits of\r\nCanada, valued only at five pounds sterling per hundred acres, amount\r\nto upwards of twenty-five millions, Pennsylvania currency; and the\r\nquit-rents at one penny sterling per acre, to two millions yearly.\r\n\r\nIt is by the sale of those lands that the debt may be sunk, without\r\nburthen to any, and the quit-rent reserved thereon, will always\r\nlessen, and in time, will wholly support the yearly expence of\r\ngovernment. It matters not how long the debt is in paying, so that\r\nthe lands when sold be applied to the discharge of it, and for the\r\nexecution of which, the Congress for the time being, will be the\r\ncontinental trustees.\r\n\r\nI proceed now to the second head, viz. Which is the easiest and\r\nmost practicable plan, RECONCILIATION or INDEPENDANCE; with some\r\noccasional remarks.\r\n\r\nHe who takes nature for his guide is not easily beaten out of his\r\nargument, and on that ground, I answer GENERALLY THAT INDEPENDANCE\r\nBEING A SINGLE SIMPLE LINE, CONTAINED WITHIN OURSELVES; AND\r\nRECONCILIATION, A MATTER EXCEEDINGLY PERPLEXED AND COMPLICATED, AND\r\nIN WHICH, A TREACHEROUS CAPRICIOUS COURT IS TO INTERFERE, GIVES THE\r\nANSWER WITHOUT A DOUBT.\r\n\r\nThe present state of America is truly alarming to every man who is\r\ncapable of reflexion. Without law, without government, without any\r\nother mode of power than what is founded on, and granted by courtesy.\r\nHeld together by an unexampled concurrence of sentiment, which, is\r\nnevertheless subject to change, and which, every secret enemy is\r\nendeavouring to dissolve. Our present condition, is, Legislation\r\nwithout law; wisdom without a plan; constitution without a name; and,\r\nwhat is strangely astonishing, perfect Independance contending for\r\ndependance. The instance is without a precedent; the case never\r\nexisted before; and who can tell what may be the event? The property\r\nof no man is secure in the present unbraced system of things. The\r\nmind of the multitude is left at random, and seeing no fixed object\r\nbefore them, they pursue such as fancy or opinion starts. Nothing is\r\ncriminal; there is no such thing as treason; wherefore, every one\r\nthinks himself at liberty to act as he pleases. The Tories dared not\r\nhave assembled offensively, had they known that their lives, by that\r\nact, were forfeited to the laws of the state. A line of distinction\r\nshould be drawn, between, English soldiers taken in battle, and\r\ninhabitants of America taken in arms. The first are prisoners, but\r\nthe latter traitors. The one forfeits his liberty, the other his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding our wisdom, there is a visible feebleness in some\r\nof our proceedings which gives encouragement to dissentions. The\r\nContinental Belt is too loosely buckled. And if something is not done\r\nin time, it will be too late to do any thing, and we shall fall into\r\na state, in which, neither RECONCILIATION nor INDEPENDANCE will\r\nbe practicable. The king and his worthless adherents are got at their\r\nold game of dividing the Continent, and there are not wanting among\r\nus, Printers, who will be busy spreading specious falsehoods. The\r\nartful and hypocritical letter which appeared a few months ago in two\r\nof the New York papers, and likewise in two others, is an evidence\r\nthat there are men who want either judgment or honesty.\r\n\r\nIt is easy getting into holes and corners and talking of\r\nreconciliation: But do such men seriously consider, how difficult the\r\ntask is, and how dangerous it may prove, should the Continent divide\r\nthereon. Do they take within their view, all the various orders of\r\nmen whose situation and circumstances, as well as their own, are to\r\nbe considered therein. Do they put themselves in the place of the\r\nsufferer whose ALL is ALREADY gone, and of the soldier, who hath\r\nquitted ALL for the defence of his country. If their ill judged\r\nmoderation be suited to their own private situations ONLY,\r\nregardless of others, the event will convince them, that \"they are\r\nreckoning without their Host.\"\r\n\r\nPut us, say some, on the footing we were on in sixty-three: To\r\nwhich I answer, the request is not NOW in the power of Britain to\r\ncomply with, neither will she propose it; but if it were, and even\r\nshould be granted, I ask, as a reasonable question, By what means is\r\nsuch a corrupt and faithless court to be kept to its engagements?\r\nAnother parliament, nay, even the present, may hereafter repeal the\r\nobligation, on the pretence, of its being violently obtained, or\r\nunwisely granted; and in that case, Where is our redress?--No going to\r\nlaw with nations; cannon are the barristers of Crowns; and the sword,\r\nnot of justice, but of war, decides the suit. To be on the footing of\r\nsixty-three, it is not sufficient, that the laws only be put on the\r\nsame state, but, that our circumstances, likewise, be put on the same\r\nstate; Our burnt and destroyed towns repaired or built up, our\r\nprivate losses made good, our public debts (contracted for defence)\r\ndischarged; otherwise, we shall be millions worse than we were at\r\nthat enviable period. Such a request, had it been complied with a\r\nyear ago, would have won the heart and soul of the Continent--but now\r\nit is too late, \"The Rubicon is passed.\"\r\n\r\nBesides, the taking up arms, merely to enforce the repeal of a\r\npecuniary law, seems as unwarrantable by the divine law, and as\r\nrepugnant to human feelings, as the taking up arms to enforce\r\nobedience thereto. The object, on either side, doth not justify the\r\nmeans; for the lives of men are too valuable to be cast away on such\r\ntrifles. It is the violence which is done and threatened to our\r\npersons; the destruction of our property by an armed force; the\r\ninvasion of our country by fire and sword, which conscientiously\r\nqualifies the use of arms: And the instant, in which such a mode of\r\ndefence became necessary, all subjection to Britain ought to have\r\nceased; and the independancy of America, should have been considered,\r\nas dating its era from, and published by, THE FIRST MUSKET THAT WAS\r\nFIRED AGAINST HER. This line is a line of consistency; neither drawn\r\nby caprice, nor extended by ambition; but produced by a chain of\r\nevents, of which the colonies were not the authors.\r\n\r\nI shall conclude these remarks, with the following timely and well\r\nintended hints. We ought to reflect, that there are three different\r\nways, by which an independancy may hereafter be effected; and that\r\nONE of those THREE, will one day or other, be the fate of\r\nAmerica, viz. By the legal voice of the people in Congress; by a\r\nmilitary power; or by a mob: It may not always happen that our\r\nsoldiers are citizens, and the multitude a body of reasonable men;\r\nvirtue, as I have already remarked, is not hereditary, neither is it\r\nperpetual. Should an independancy be brought about by the first of\r\nthose means, we have every opportunity and every encouragement before\r\nus, to form the noblest purest constitution on the face of the earth.\r\nWe have it in our power to begin the world over again. A situation,\r\nsimilar to the present, hath not happened since the days of Noah\r\nuntil now. The birthday of a new world is at hand, and a race of men,\r\nperhaps as numerous as all Europe contains, are to receive their\r\nportion of freedom from the event of a few months. The Reflexion is\r\nawful--and in this point of view, How trifling, how ridiculous, do the\r\nlittle, paltry cavellings, of a few weak or interested men appear,\r\nwhen weighed against the business of a world.\r\n\r\nShould we neglect the present favorable and inviting period, and an\r\nIndependance be hereafter effected by any other means, we must charge\r\nthe consequence to ourselves, or to those rather, whose narrow and\r\nprejudiced souls, are habitually opposing the measure, without either\r\ninquiring or reflecting. There are reasons to be given in support of\r\nIndependance, which men should rather privately think of, than be\r\npublicly told of. We ought not now to be debating whether we shall be\r\nindependant or not, but, anxious to accomplish it on a firm, secure,\r\nand honorable basis, and uneasy rather that it is not yet began upon.\r\nEvery day convinces us of its necessity. Even the Tories (if such\r\nbeings yet remain among us) should, of all men, be the most\r\nsolicitous to promote it; for, as the appointment of committees at\r\nfirst, protected them from popular rage, so, a wise and well\r\nestablished form of government, will be the only certain means of\r\ncontinuing it securely to them. WHEREFORE, if they have not virtue\r\nenough to be WHIGS, they ought to have prudence enough to wish for\r\nIndependance.\r\n\r\nIn short, Independance is the only BOND that can tye and keep us\r\ntogether. We shall then see our object, and our ears will be legally\r\nshut against the schemes of an intriguing, as well, as a cruel enemy.\r\nWe shall then too, be on a proper footing, to treat with Britain; for\r\nthere is reason to conclude, that the pride of that court, will be\r\nless hurt by treating with the American states for terms of peace,\r\nthan with those, whom she denominates, \"rebellious subjects,\" for\r\nterms of accommodation. It is our delaying it that encourages her to\r\nhope for conquest, and our backwardness tends only to prolong the\r\nwar. As we have, without any good effect therefrom, withheld our\r\ntrade to obtain a redress of our grievances, let us NOW try the\r\nalternative, by INDEPENDANTLY redressing them ourselves, and then\r\noffering to open the trade. The mercantile and reasonable part in\r\nEngland, will be still with us; because, peace WITH trade, is\r\npreferable to war WITHOUT it. And if this offer be not accepted,\r\nother courts may be applied to.\r\n\r\nOn these grounds I rest the matter. And as no offer hath yet been\r\nmade to refute the doctrine contained in the former editions of this\r\npamphlet, it is a negative proof, that either the doctrine cannot be\r\nrefuted, or, that the party in favour of it are too numerous to be\r\nopposed. WHEREFORE, instead of gazing at each other with suspicious\r\nor doubtful curiosity, let each of us, hold out to his neighbour the\r\nhearty hand of friendship, and unite in drawing a line, which, like\r\nan act of oblivion, shall bury in forgetfulness every former\r\ndissention. Let the names of Whig and Tory be extinct; and let none\r\nother be heard among us, than those of A GOOD CITIZEN, AN OPEN AND\r\nRESOLUTE FRIEND, AND A VIRTUOUS SUPPORTER OF THE RIGHTS OF MANKIND\r\nAND OF THE FREE AND INDEPENDANT STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\n\r\n----End of COMMON SENSE by Thomas Paine\r\n\r\nCorrections: 55,553 replaced by 35,553",
