The problems with which we are\r\nconfronted are the problems of growth and of progress. In their solution we\r\nhave to determine the facts, to develop the relative importance to be\r\nassigned to such facts, to formulate a common judgment upon them, and to\r\nrealize solutions in spirit of conciliation.\r\n\r\nFOREIGN RELATIONS\r\n\r\nWe are not only at peace with all the world, but the foundations for future\r\npeace are being substantially strengthened. To promote peace is our\r\nlong-established policy. Through the Kellogg-Briand pact a great moral\r\nstandard has been raised in the world. By it fifty-four nations have\r\ncovenanted to renounce war and to settle all disputes by pacific means.\r\nThrough it a new world outlook has been inaugurated which has profoundly\r\naffected the foreign policies of nations. Since its inauguration we have\r\ninitiated new efforts not only in the organization of the machinery of\r\npeace but also to eliminate dangerous forces which produce controversies\r\namongst nations.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1926, the Senate gave its consent to adherence to the Court of\r\nInternational Justice with certain reservations. In September of this year\r\nthe statute establishing the court has, by the action of the nations\r\nsignatory, been amended to meet the Senate's reservations and to go even\r\nbeyond those reservations to make clear that the court is a true\r\ninternational court of justice. I believe it will be clear to everyone that\r\nno controversy or question in which this country has or claims an interest\r\ncan be passed on by the court without our consent at the time the question\r\narises. The doubt about advisory opinions has been completely safeguarded.\r\nOur adherence to the International Court is, as now constituted, not the\r\nslightest step toward entry into the League of Nations. As I have before\r\nindicated, I shall direct that our signature be affixed to the protocol of\r\nadherence and shall submit it for the approval of the Senate with a special\r\nmessage at some time when it is convenient to deal with it.\r\n\r\nIn the hope of reducing friction in the world, and with the desire that we\r\nmay reduce the great economic burdens of naval armament, we have joined in\r\nconference with Great Britain, France, Italy, and Japan to be held in\r\nLondon in January to consider the further limitation and reduction of naval\r\narms. We hold high hopes that success may attend this effort.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the present administration the neighboring State of\r\nMexico was best with domestic insurrection. We maintained the embargo upon\r\nthe shipment of arms to Mexico but permitted the duly constituted\r\nGovernment to procure supplies from our surplus war stocks. Fortunately,\r\nthe Mexican Government by its own strength successfully withstood the\r\ninsurrection with but slight damage. Opportunity of further peaceful\r\ndevelopment is given to that country. At the request of the Mexican\r\nGovernment, we have since lifted the embargo on shipment of arms\r\naltogether. The two governments have taken further steps to promote\r\nfriendly relationships and so solve our differences. Conventions prolonging\r\nfor a period of two years the life of the general and special claims\r\ncommissions have been concluded.\r\n\r\nIn South America we are proud to have had part in the settlement of the\r\nlong-standing dispute between Chile and Peru in the disposal of the\r\nquestion of Tacna-Arica.\r\n\r\nThe work of the commission of inquiry and conciliation between Bolivia and\r\nParaguay, in which a representative of this Government participated, has\r\nsuccessfully terminated an incident which seemed to threaten war. The\r\nproposed plan for final settlement as suggested by the neutral governments\r\nis still under consideration.\r\n\r\nThis Government has continued its efforts to act as a mediator in boundary\r\ndifficulties between Guatemala and Honduras.\r\n\r\nA further instance of profound importance in establishing good will was the\r\ninauguration of regular air mail service between the United States and\r\nCaribbean, Central American, and South American countries.\r\n\r\nWe still have marines on foreign soil--in Nicaragua, Haiti, and China. In\r\nthe large sense we do not wish to be represented abroad in such manner.\r\nAbout 1,600 marines remain in Nicaragua at the urgent request of that\r\ngovernment and the leaders of all parties pending the training of a\r\ndomestic constabulary capable of insuring tranquility. We have already\r\nreduced these forces materially and we are anxious to withdraw them further\r\nas the situation warrants. In Haiti we have about 700 marines, but it is a\r\nmuch more difficult problem, the solution of which is still obscure. If\r\nCongress approves, I shall dispatch a commission to Haiti to review and\r\nstudy the matter in an endeavor to arrive at some more definite policy than\r\nat present. Our forces in China constitute 2,605 men, which we hope also\r\nfurther to reduce to the normal legation guard.\r\n\r\nIt is my desire to establish more firmly our understanding and\r\nrelationships with the Latin American countries by strengthening the\r\ndiplomatic missions to those countries. It is my hope to secure men long\r\nexperienced in our Diplomatic Service, who speak the languages of the\r\npeoples to whom they are accredited, as chiefs of our diplomatic missions\r\nin these States. I shall send to the Senate at an early date the\r\nnominations of several such men.\r\n\r\nThe Congress has by numerous wise and foresighted acts in the past few\r\nyears greatly strengthened the character of our representation abroad. It\r\nhas made liberal provision for the establishment of suitable quarters for\r\nour foreign staffs in the different countries. In order, however, that we\r\nmay further develop the most effective force in this, one of the most\r\nresponsible functions of our Government, I shall recommend to the Congress\r\nmore liberal appropriations for the work of the State Department. I know of\r\nno expenditure of public money from which a greater economic and moral\r\nreturn can come to us than by assuring the most effective conduct of our\r\nforeign relations.\r\n\r\nNATIONAL DEFENSE\r\n\r\nTo preserve internal order and freedom from encroachment is the first\r\npurpose of government. Our Army and Navy are being maintained in a most\r\nefficient state under officers of high intelligence and zeal. The extent\r\nand expansion of their numbers and equipment as at present authorized are\r\nample for this purpose.\r\n\r\nWe can well be deeply concerned, however, at the growing expense. From a\r\ntotal expenditure for national defense purposes in 1914 of $267,000,000, it\r\nnaturally rose with the Great War, but receded again to $612,000,000 in\r\n1924, when again it began to rise until during the current fiscal year the\r\nexpenditures will reach to over $730,000,000, excluding all civilian\r\nservices of those departments. Programs now authorized will carry it to\r\nstill larger figures in future years. While the remuneration paid to our\r\nsoldiers and sailors is justly at a higher rate than that of any other\r\ncountry in the world, and while the cost of subsistence is higher, yet the\r\ntotal of our expenditures is in excess of those of the most highly\r\nmilitarized nations of the world.\r\n\r\nUpon the conference shortly to be held in London will depend such\r\nmoderation as we can make in naval expenditure. If we shall be compelled to\r\nundertake the naval construction implied in the Washington arms treaty as\r\nwell as other construction which would appear to be necessary if no\r\ninternational agreement can be completed, we shall be committed during the\r\nnext six years to a construction expenditure of upward of $1,200,000,000\r\nbesides the necessary further increase in costs for annual upkeep.\r\n\r\nAfter 1914 the various Army contingents necessarily expanded to the end of\r\nthe Great War and then receded to the low point in 1924, when expansion\r\nagain began. In 1914 the officers and men in our regular forces, both Army\r\nand Navy, were about 164,000, in 1924 there were about 256,000, and in 1929\r\nthere were about 250,000. Our citizens' army, however, including the\r\nNational Guard and other forms of reserves, increase these totals up to\r\nabout 299,000 in 1914, about 672,000 in 1924, and about 728,000 in 1929.\r\n\r\nUnder the Kellogg pact we have undertaken never to use war as an instrument\r\nof national policy. We have, therefore, undertaken by covenant to use these\r\nequipments solely for defensive purposes. From a defense point of view our\r\nforces should be proportioned to national need and should, therefore, to\r\nsome extent be modified by the prospects of peace, which were never\r\nbrighter than to-day.\r\n\r\nIt should be borne in mind that the improvement in the National Guard by\r\nFederal support begun in 1920 has definitely strengthened our national\r\nsecurity by rendering them far more effective than ever heretofore. The\r\nadvance of aviation has also greatly increased our effectiveness in\r\ndefense. In addition to the very large program of air forces which we are\r\nmaintaining in the Army and Navy, there has been an enormous growth of\r\ncommercial aviation. This has provided unanticipated reserves in\r\nmanufacturing capacity and in industrial and air personnel, which again\r\nadds to our security.\r\n\r\nI recommend that Congress give earnest consideration to the possibilities\r\nof prudent action which will give relief from our continuously mounting\r\nexpenditures.\r\n\r\nFINANCES OF THE GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nThe finances of the Government are in sound condition. I shall submit the\r\ndetailed evidences and the usual recommendations in the special Budget\r\nmessage. I may, however, summarize our position. The public debt on June 30\r\nthis year stood at $16,931,000,000, compared to the maximum in August,\r\n1919, of $26,596,000,000. Since June 30 it has been reduced by a further\r\n$238,000,000. In the Budget to be submitted the total appropriations\r\nrecommended for the fiscal year 1931 are $3,830,445,231, as compared to\r\n$3,976,141,651 for the present fiscal year. The present fiscal year,\r\nhowever, includes $150,000,000 for the Federal Farm Board, as to which no\r\nestimate can as yet be determined for 1931.\r\n\r\nOwing to the many necessary burdens assumed by Congress in previous years\r\nwhich now require large outlays, it is with extreme difficulty that we\r\nshall be able to keep the expenditures for the next fiscal year within the\r\nbounds of the present year. Economies in many directions have permitted\r\nsome accommodation of pressing needs, the net result being an increase, as\r\nshown above, of about one-tenth of 1 per cent above the present fiscal\r\nyear. We can not fail to recognize the obligations of the Government in\r\nsupport of the public welfare but we must coincidentally bear in mind the\r\nburden of taxes and strive to find relief through some tax reduction. Every\r\ndollar so returned fertilizes the soil of prosperity.\r\n\r\nTAX REDUCTION\r\n\r\nThe estimate submitted to me by the Secretary of the Treasury and the\r\nBudget Director indicates that the Government will close the fiscal year\r\n1930 with a surplus of about $225,000,000 and the fiscal year 1931 with a\r\nsurplus of about $123,000,000. Owing to unusual circumstances, it has been\r\nextremely difficult to estimate future revenues with accuracy.\r\n\r\nI believe, however, that the Congress will be fully justified in giving the\r\nbenefits of the prospective surpluses to the taxpayers, particularly as\r\nample provision for debt reduction has been made in both years through the\r\nform of debt retirement from ordinary revenues. In view of the uncertainty\r\nin respect of future revenues and the comparatively small size of the\r\nindicated surplus in 1931, relief should take the form of a provisional\r\nrevision of tax rates.\r\n\r\nI recommend that the normal income tax rates applicable to the incomes of\r\nindividuals for the calendar year 1929 be reduced from 5, 3, and 1 1/2;\r\nper cent, to 4, 2, and 1/2; per cent, and that the tax on the income of\r\ncorporations for the calendar year 1929 be reduced from 12 to 11 per cent.\r\nIt is estimated that this will result in a reduction of $160,000,000 in\r\nincome taxes to be collected during the calendar year 1930. The loss in\r\nrevenue will be divided approximately equally between the fiscal years 1930\r\nand 1931. Such a program will give a measure of tax relief to the maximum\r\nnumber of taxpayers, with relatively larger benefits to taxpayers with\r\nsmall or moderate incomes.\r\n\r\nFOREIGN DEBTS\r\n\r\nThe past year has brought us near to completion of settlements of the\r\nindebtedness of foreign governments to the United States.\r\n\r\nThe act of Congress approved February 4, 1929, authorized the settlement\r\nwith the Government of Austria along lines similar to the terms of\r\nsettlement offered by that Government to its other relief creditors. No\r\nagreement has yet been concluded with that government, but the form of\r\nagreement has been settled and its execution only awaits the Government of\r\nAustria securing the assent by all the other relief creditors of the terms\r\noffered. The act of Congress approved February 14, 1929, authorized the\r\nsettlement with the Government of Greece, and an agreement was concluded on\r\nMay 10, 1929.\r\n\r\nThe Government of France ratified the agreement with us on July 27, 1929.\r\nThis agreement will shortly be before the Congress and I recommend its\r\napproval.\r\n\r\nThe only indebtedness of foreign governments to the United States now\r\nunsettled is that of Russia and Armenia.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year a committee of distinguished experts under American\r\nleadership submitted a plan looking to a revision of claims against Germany\r\nby the various Governments. The United States denied itself any\r\nparticipation in the war settlement of general reparations and our claims\r\nare comparatively small in amount. They arise from costs of the army of\r\noccupation and claims of our private citizens for losses under awards from\r\nthe Mixed Claims Commission established under agreement with the German\r\nGovernment. In finding a basis for settlement it was necessary for the\r\ncommittee of experts to request all the Governments concerned to make some\r\ncontribution to the adjustment and we have felt that we should share a\r\nproportion of the concessions made.\r\n\r\nThe State and Treasury Departments will be in a position shortly to submit\r\nfor your consideration a draft of an agreement to be executed between the\r\nUnited States and Germany providing for the payments of these revised\r\namounts. A more extensive statement will be submitted at that time.\r\n\r\nThe total amount of indebtedness of the various countries to the United\r\nStates now funded is $11,579,465,885. This sum was in effect provided by\r\nthe issue of United States Government bonds to our own people. The payments\r\nof the various Governments to us on account of principal and interest for\r\n1930 are estimated at a total of about $239,000,000, for 1931 at about\r\n$236,000,000, for 1932 at about $246,000,000. The measure of American\r\ncompromise in these settlements may be appreciated from the fact that our\r\ntaxpayers are called upon to find annually about $475,000,000 in interest\r\nand in addition to redeem the principal of sums borrowed by the United\r\nStates Government for these purposes.\r\n\r\nALIEN ENEMY PROPERTY\r\n\r\nThe wise determination that this property seized in war should be returned\r\nto its owners has proceeded with considerable rapidity. Of the original\r\nseized cash and property (valued at a total of about $625,000,000), all but\r\n$111,566,700 has been returned. Most of the remainder should be disposed of\r\nduring the next year.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ECONOMIC SITUATION\r\n\r\nThe country has enjoyed a large degree of prosperity and sound progress\r\nduring the past year with a steady improvement in methods of production and\r\ndistribution and consequent advancement in standards of living. Progress\r\nhas, of course, been unequal among industries, and some, such as coal,\r\nlumber, leather, and textiles, still lag behind. The long upward trend of\r\nfundamental progress, however, gave rise to over-optimism as to profits,\r\nwhich translated itself into a wave of uncontrolled speculation in\r\nsecurities, resulting in the diversion of capital from business to the\r\nstock market and the inevitable crash. The natural consequences have been a\r\nreduction in the consumption of luxuries and semi-necessities by those who\r\nhave met with losses, and a number of persons thrown temporarily out of\r\nemployment. Prices of agricultural products dealt in upon the great markets\r\nhave been affected in sympathy with the stock crash.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the Federal reserve system had taken measures to strengthen\r\nthe position against the day when speculation would break, which together\r\nwith the strong position of the banks has carried the whole credit system\r\nthrough the crisis without impairment. The capital which has been hitherto\r\nabsorbed in stock-market loans for speculative purposes is now returning to\r\nthe normal channels of business. There has been no inflation in the prices\r\nof commodities; there has been no undue accumulation of goods, and foreign\r\ntrade has expanded to a magnitude which exerts a steadying influence upon\r\nactivity in industry and employment.\r\n\r\nThe sudden threat of unemployment and especially the recollection of the\r\neconomic consequences of previous crashes under a much less secured\r\nfinancial system created unwarranted pessimism and fear. It was recalled\r\nthat past storms of similar character had resulted in retrenchment of\r\nconstruction, reduction of wages, and laying off of workers. The natural\r\nresult was the tendency of business agencies throughout the country to\r\npause in their plans and proposals for continuation and extension of their\r\nbusinesses, and this hesitation unchecked could in itself intensify into a\r\ndepression with widespread unemployment and suffering.\r\n\r\nI have, therefore, instituted systematic, voluntary measures of cooperation\r\nwith the business institutions and with State and municipal authorities to\r\nmake certain that fundamental businesses of the country shall continue as\r\nusual, that wages and therefore consuming power shall not be reduced, and\r\nthat a special effort shall be made to expand construction work in order to\r\nassist in equalizing other deficits in employment. Due to the enlarged\r\nsense of cooperation and responsibility which has grown in the business\r\nworld during the past few years the response has been remarkable and\r\nsatisfactory. We have canvassed the Federal Government and instituted\r\nmeasures of prudent expansion in such work that should be helpful, and upon\r\nwhich the different departments will make some early recommendations to\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nI am convinced that through these measures we have reestablished\r\nconfidence. Wages should remain stable. A very large degree of industrial\r\nunemployment and suffering which would otherwise have occurred has been\r\nprevented. Agricultural prices have reflected the returning confidence. The\r\nmeasures taken must be vigorously pursued until normal conditions are\r\nrestored.\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURE\r\n\r\nThe agricultural situation is improving. The gross farm income as estimated\r\nby the Department of Agriculture for the crop season 1926-27 was\r\n$12,100,000,000; for 1927-28 it was $12,300,000,000; for 1928-29 it was\r\n$12,500,000,000; and estimated on the basis of prices since the last\r\nharvest the value of the 1929-30 crop would be over $12,650,000,000. The\r\nslight decline in general commodity prices during the past few years\r\nnaturally assists the farmers' buying power.\r\n\r\nThe number of farmer bankruptcies is very materially decreased below\r\nprevious years. The decline in land values now seems to be arrested and\r\nrate of movement from the farm to the city has been reduced. Not all\r\nsections of agriculture, of course, have fared equally, and some areas have\r\nsuffered from drought. Responsible farm leaders have assured me that a\r\nlarge measure of confidence is returning to agriculture and that a feeling\r\nof optimism pervades that industry.\r\n\r\nThe most extensive action for strengthening the agricultural industry ever\r\ntaken by any government was inaugurated through the farm marketing act of\r\nJune 15 last. Under its provisions the Federal Farm Board has been\r\nestablished, comprised of men long and widely experienced in agriculture\r\nand sponsored by the farm organizations of the country. During its short\r\nperiod of existence the board has taken definite steps toward a more\r\nefficient organization of agriculture, toward the elimination of waste in\r\nmarketing, and toward the upbuilding of farmers' marketing organizations on\r\nsounder and more efficient lines. Substantial headway has been made in the\r\norganization of four of the basic commodities--grain, cotton, livestock,\r\nand wool. Support by the board to cooperative marketing organizations and\r\nother board activities undoubtedly have served to steady the farmers'\r\nmarket during the recent crisis and have operated also as a great stimulus\r\nto the cooperative organization of agriculture. The problems of the\r\nindustry are most complex, and the need for sound organization is\r\nimperative. Yet the board is moving rapidly along the lines laid out for it\r\nin the act, facilitating the creation by farmers of farmer-owned and\r\nfarmer-controlled organizations and federating them into central\r\ninstitutions, with a view to increasing the bargaining power of\r\nagriculture, preventing and controlling surpluses, and mobilizing the\r\neconomic power of agriculture.\r\n\r\nTHE TARIFF\r\n\r\nThe special session of Congress was called to expedite the fulfillment of\r\nparty pledges of agricultural relief and the tariff. The pledge of farm\r\nrelief has been carried out. At that time I stated the principles upon\r\nwhich I believed action should be taken in respect to the tariff: \"An\r\neffective tariff upon agricultural products, that will compensate the\r\nfarmer's higher costs and higher standards of living, has a dual purpose.\r\nSuch a tariff not only protects the farmer in our domestic market but it\r\nalso stimulates him to diversify his crops and to grow products that he\r\ncould not otherwise produce, and thus lessens his dependence upon exports\r\nto foreign markets. The great expansion of production abroad under the\r\nconditions I have mentioned renders foreign competition in our export\r\nmarkets increasingly serious. It seems but natural, therefore, that the\r\nAmerican farmer, having been greatly handicapped in his foreign market by\r\nsuch competition from the younger expanding countries, should ask that\r\nforeign access to our domestic market should be regulated by taking into\r\naccount the differences in our costs of production.\r\n\r\n\"In considering the tariff for other industries than agriculture, we find\r\nthat there have been economic shifts necessitating a readjustment of some\r\nof the tariff schedules. Seven years of experience under the tariff bill\r\nenacted in 1922 have demonstrated the wisdom of Congress in the enactment\r\nof that measure. On the whole it has worked well. In the main our wages\r\nhave been maintained at high levels; our exports and imports have steadily\r\nincreased; with some exceptions our manufacturing industries have been\r\nprosperous. Nevertheless, economic changes have taken place during that\r\ntime which have placed certain domestic products at a disadvantage and new\r\nindustries have come into being, all of which create the necessity for some\r\nlimited changes in the schedules and in the administrative clauses of the\r\nlaws as written in 1922.\r\n\r\n\"It would seem to me that the test of necessity for revision is, in the\r\nmain, whether there has been a substantial slackening of activity in an\r\nindustry during the past few years, and a consequent decrease of employment\r\ndue to insurmountable competition in the products of that industry. It is\r\nnot as if we were setting up a new basis of protective duties. We did that\r\nseven years ago. What we need to remedy now is whatever substantial loss of\r\nemployment may have resulted from shifts since that time.\r\n\r\n\"In determining changes in our tariff we must not fail to take into account\r\nthe broad interests of the country as a whole, and such interests include\r\nour trade relations with other countries.\" No condition has arisen in my\r\nview to change these principles stated at the opening of the special\r\nsession. I am firmly of the opinion that their application to the pending\r\nrevision will give the country the kind of a tariff law it both needs and\r\nwants. It would be most helpful if action should be taken at an early\r\nmoment, more especially at a time when business and agriculture are both\r\ncooperating to minimize future uncertainties. It is just that they should\r\nknow what the rates are to be.\r\n\r\nEven a limited revision requires the consideration and readjustment of many\r\nitems. The exhaustive inquiries and valuable debate from men representative\r\nof all parts of the country which is needed to determine the detailed rates\r\nmust necessarily be accomplished in the Congress. However perfectly this\r\nrate structure may be framed at any given time, the shifting of economic\r\nforces which inevitably occurs will render changes in some items desirable\r\nbetween the necessarily long intervals of congressional revision.\r\nInjustices are bound to develop, such as were experienced by the dairymen,\r\nthe flaxseed producers, the glass industry, and others, under the 1922\r\nrates. For this reason, I have been most anxious that the broad principle\r\nof the flexible tariff as provided in the existing law should be preserved\r\nand its delays in action avoided by more expeditious methods of determining\r\nthe costs of production at home and abroad, with executive authority to\r\npromulgate such changes upon recommendation of the Tariff Commission after\r\nexhaustive investigation. Changes by the Congress in the isolated items\r\nsuch as those to which I have referred would have been most unlikely both\r\nbecause of the concentrations of oppositions in the country, who could see\r\nno advantage to their own industry or State, and because of the difficulty\r\nof limiting consideration by the Congress to such isolated cases.\r\n\r\nThere is no fundamental conflict between the interests of the farmer and\r\nthe worker. Lowering of the standards of living of either tends to destroy\r\nthe other. The prosperity of one rests upon the well-being of the other.\r\nNor is there any real conflict between the East and the West or the North\r\nand the South in the United States. The complete interlocking of economic\r\ndependence, the common striving for social and spiritual progress, our\r\ncommon heritage as Americans, and the infinite web of national sentiment,\r\nhave created a solidarity in a great people unparalleled in all human\r\nhistory. These invisible bonds should not and can not be shattered by\r\ndifferences of opinion growing out of discussion of a tariff.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC BUILDINGS\r\n\r\nUnder the provisions of various acts of Congress $300,000,000 has been\r\nauthorized for public buildings and the land upon which to construct them,\r\nbeing $75,000,000 for the District of Columbia and $225,000,000 for the\r\ncountry at large. Excluding $25,000,000 which is for the acquisition of\r\nland in the so-called \"triangle\" in this city, this public building\r\nlegislation provides for a five-year program for the District of Columbia\r\nand between an eight and nine year program for the country at large. Of\r\nthis sum approximately $27,400,000 was expended up to June 30 last, of\r\nwhich $11,400,000 has been expended in the District and $16,000,000\r\noutside.\r\n\r\nEven this generous provision for both the District of Columbia and the\r\ncountry is insufficient For most pressing governmental needs. Expensive\r\nrents and inadequate facilities are extravagance and not economy. In the\r\nDistrict even after the completion of these projects we shall have fully\r\n20,000 clerks housed in rented and temporary war buildings which can last\r\nbut a little longer.\r\n\r\nI therefore recommend that consideration should be given to the extension\r\nof authorizations both for the country at large and for the District of\r\nColumbia again distributed over a term of years. A survey of the need in\r\nboth categories has been made by the Secretary of the Treasury and the\r\nPostmaster General. It would be helpful in the present economic situation\r\nif such steps were taken as would enable early construction work.\r\n\r\nAn expedition and enlargement of the program in the District would bring\r\nabout direct economies in construction by enabling the erection of\r\nbuildings in regular sequence. By maintaining a stable labor force in the\r\ncity, contracts can be made on more advantageous terms.\r\n\r\nThe earlier completion of this program which is an acknowledged need would\r\nadd dignity to the celebration in 1932 of the two hundredth anniversary of\r\nthe birth of President Washington.\r\n\r\nIn consideration of these projects which contribute so much to dignify the\r\nNational Capital I should like to renew the suggestion that the Fine Arts\r\nCommission should be required to pass upon private buildings which are\r\nproposed for sites facing upon public buildings and parks. Without such\r\ncontrol much of the effort of the Congress in beautification of the Capital\r\nwill be minimized.\r\n\r\nTHE WATERWAYS AND FLOOD CONTROL\r\n\r\nThe development of inland waterways has received new impulse from the\r\ncompletion during this year of the canalization of the Ohio to a uniform\r\n9-foot depth. The development of the other segments of the Mississippi\r\nsystem should be expedited and with this in view I am recommending an\r\nincrease in appropriations for rivers and harbors from $50,000,000 to\r\n$55,000,000 per annum which, together with about $4,000,000 per annum\r\nreleased by completion of the Ohio, should make available after providing\r\nfor other river and harbor works a sum of from $25,000,000 to $30,000,000\r\nper annum for the Mississippi system and thus bring it to early\r\ncompletion.\r\n\r\nConflict of opinion which has arisen over the proposed floodway from the\r\nArkansas River to the Gulf of Mexico via the Atchafalaya River has led me\r\nto withhold construction upon this portion of the Mississippi flood control\r\nplan until it could be again reviewed by the engineers for any further\r\nrecommendation to Congress. The other portions of the project are being\r\nvigorously prosecuted and I have recommended an increase in appropriations\r\nfor this from $30,000,000 of the present year to $35,000,000 during the\r\nnext fiscal year.\r\n\r\nExpansion of our intracoastal waterways to effective barge depths is well\r\nwarranted. We are awaiting the action of Canada upon the St. Lawrence\r\nwaterway project.\r\n\r\nHIGHWAYS\r\n\r\nThere are over 3,000,000 miles of legally established highways in the\r\nUnited States, of which about 10 per cent are included in the State highway\r\nsystems, the remainder being county and other local roads. About 626,000\r\nmiles have been improved with some type of surfacing, comprising some 63\r\nper cent of the State highway systems and 16 per cent of the local roads.\r\nOf the improved roads about 102,000 miles are hard surfaced, comprising\r\nabout 22 per cent of the State highway systems and about 8 per cent of the\r\nlocal roads.\r\n\r\nWhile proper planning should materially reduce the listed mileage of public\r\nroads, particularly in the agricultural districts, and turn these roads\r\nback to useful purposes, it is evident that road construction must be a\r\nlong-continued program. Progress in improvement is about 50,000 miles of\r\nall types per annum, of which some 12,000 miles are of the more durable\r\ntypes. The total expenditures of Federal, State, and local governments last\r\nyear for construction and maintenance assumed the huge total of\r\n$1,660,000,000.\r\n\r\nFederal aid in the construction of the highway systems in conjunction with\r\nthe States has proved to be beneficial and stimulating. We must ultimately\r\ngive consideration to the increase of our contribution to these systems,\r\nparticularly with a view to stimulating the improvement of farm-to-market\r\nroads.\r\n\r\nPOST OFFICE\r\n\r\nOur Post Office deficit has now increased to over $80,000,000 a year, of\r\nwhich perhaps $14,000,000 is due to losses on ocean mail and air mail\r\ncontracts. The department is making an exhaustive study of the sources of\r\nthe deficit with view to later recommendation to Congress in respect to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe Post Office quarters are provided in part by the Federal construction,\r\nin part by various forms of rent and lease arrangements. The practice has\r\ngrown up in recent years of contracting long term leases under which both\r\nrent and amortization principal cost of buildings is included. I am advised\r\nthat fully 40 per cent could be saved from many such rent and lease\r\nagreements even after allowing interest on the capital required at the\r\nnormal Government rate. There are also many objectionable features to some\r\nof these practices. The provision of adequate quarters for the Post Office\r\nshould be put on a sound basis.\r\n\r\nA revision of air mail rates upon a more systematic and permanent footing\r\nis necessary. The subject is under study, and if legislation should prove\r\nnecessary the subject will be presented to the Congress. In the meantime I\r\nrecommend that the Congress should consider the desirability of authorizing\r\nfurther expansion of the South American services.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL AVIATION\r\n\r\nDuring the past year progress in civil aeronautics has been remarkable.\r\nThis is to a considerable degree due to the wise assistance of the Federal\r\nGovernment through the establishment and maintenance of airways by the\r\nDepartment of Commerce and the mail contracts from the Post Office\r\nDepartment. The Government-improved airways now exceed 25,000 miles--more\r\nthan 14,000 miles of which will be lighted and equipped for night-flying\r\noperations by the close of the current year. Airport construction through\r\nall the States is extremely active. There are now 1,000 commercial and\r\nmunicipal airports in operation with an additional 1,200 proposed for early\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nThrough this assistance the Nation is building a sound aviation system,\r\noperated by private enterprise. Over 6,400 planes are in commercial use,\r\nand 9,400 pilots are licensed by the Government. Our manufacturing capacity\r\nhas risen to 7,500 planes per annum. The aviation companies have increased\r\nregular air transportation until it now totals 90,000 miles per\r\nday--one-fourth of which is flown by night. Mail and express services now\r\nconnect our principal cities, and extensive services for passenger\r\ntransportation have been inaugurated, and others of importance are\r\nimminent. American air lines now reach into Canada and Mexico, to Cuba,\r\nPorto Rico, Central America, and most of the important countries of South\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nRAILWAYS\r\n\r\nAs a whole, the railroads never were in such good physical and financial\r\ncondition, and the country has never been so well served by them. The\r\ngreatest volume of freight traffic ever tendered is being carried at a\r\nspeed never before attained and with satisfaction to the shippers.\r\nEfficiencies and new methods have resulted in reduction in the cost of\r\nproviding freight transportation, and freight rates show a continuous\r\ndescending line from the level enforced by the World War.\r\n\r\nWe have, however, not yet assured for the future that adequate system of\r\ntransportation through consolidations which was the objective of the\r\nCongress in the transportation act. The chief purpose of consolidation is\r\nto secure well-balanced systems with more uniform and satisfactory rate\r\nstructure, a more stable financial structure, more equitable distribution\r\nof traffic, greater efficiency, and single-line instead of multiple-line\r\nhauls. In this way the country will have the assurance of better service\r\nand ultimately at lower and more even rates than would otherwise be\r\nattained. Legislation to simplify and expedite consolidation methods and\r\nbetter to protect public interest should be enacted.\r\n\r\nConsideration should also be given to relief of the members of the\r\nCommission from the necessity of detailed attention to comparatively\r\ninconsequential matters which, under the existing law, must receive their\r\ndirect and personal consideration. It is in the public interest that the\r\nmembers of the Commission should not be so pressed by minor matters that\r\nthey have inadequate time for investigation and consideration of the larger\r\nquestions committed to them for solution. As to many of these minor\r\nmatters, the function of the Commission might well be made revisory, and\r\nthe primary responsibility delegated to subordinate officials after the\r\npractice long in vogue in the executive departments.\r\n\r\nMERCHANT MARINE\r\n\r\nUnder the impulse of the merchant marine act of 1928 the transfer to\r\nprivate enterprise of the Government-owned steamship lines is going forward\r\nwith increasing success. The Shipping Board now operates about 18 lines,\r\nwhich is less than half the number originally established, and the estimate\r\nof expenditures for the coming fiscal year is based upon reduction in\r\nlosses on Government lines by approximately one-half. Construction loans\r\nhave been made to the amount of approximately $75,000,000 out of the\r\nrevolving fund authorized by Congress and have furnished an additional aid\r\nto American shipping and further stimulated the building of vessels in\r\nAmerican yards.\r\n\r\nDesirous of securing the full values to the Nation of the great effort to\r\ndevelop our merchant marine by the merchant marine act soon after the\r\ninauguration of the present administration, I appointed an\r\ninterdepartmental committee, consisting of the Secretary of Commerce, as\r\nchairman, the Secretary of the Navy, the Postmaster General, and the\r\nchairman of the Shipping Board, to make a survey of the policies being\r\npursued under the act of 1928 in respect of mail contracts; to inquire into\r\nits workings and to advise the Postmaster General in the administration of\r\nthe act.\r\n\r\nIn particular it seemed to me necessary to determine if the result of the\r\ncontracts already let would assure the purpose expressed in the act, \"to\r\nfurther develop an American merchant marine, to assure its permanence in\r\nthe transportation of the foreign trade of the United States, and for other\r\npurposes,\" and to develop a coordinated policy by which these purposes may\r\nbe translated into actualities.\r\n\r\nIn review of the mail contracts already awarded it was found that they\r\naggregated 25 separate awards imposing a governmental obligation of a\r\nlittle over $12,000,000 per annum. Provision had been imposed in five of\r\nthe contracts for construction of new vessels with which to replace and\r\nexpand services. These requirements come to a total of 12 vessels in the\r\n10-year period, aggregating 122,000 tons. Some other conditions in the\r\ncontracts had not worked out satisfactorily.\r\n\r\nThat study has now been substantially completed and the committee has\r\nadvised the desirability and the necessity of securing much larger\r\nundertakings as to service and new construction in future contracts. The\r\ncommittee at this time is recommending the advertising of 14 additional\r\nroutes, making substantial requirements for the construction of new vessels\r\nduring the life of each contract recommended. A total of 40 new vessels\r\nwill be required under the contracts proposed, about half of which will be\r\nrequired to be built during the next three years. The capital cost of this\r\nnew construction will be approximately $250,000,000, involving\r\napproximately 460,000 gross tons. Should bidders be found who will make\r\nthese undertakings, it will be necessary to recommend to Congress an\r\nincrease in the authorized expenditure by the Post Office of about\r\n$5,500,000 annually. It will be most advantageous to grant such an\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nA conflict as to the administration of the act has arisen in the contention\r\nof persons who have purchased Shipping Board vessels that they are entitled\r\nto mail contracts irrespective of whether they are the lowest bidder, the\r\nPost Office, on the other hand, being required by law to let contracts in\r\nthat manner. It is urgent that Congress should clarify this situation.\r\n\r\nTHE BANKING SYSTEM\r\n\r\nIt is desirable that Congress should consider the revision of some portions\r\nof the banking law.\r\n\r\nThe development of \"group\" and \"chain\" banking presents many new problems.\r\nThe question naturally arises as to whether if allowed to expand without\r\nrestraint these methods would dangerously concentrate control of credit,\r\nand whether they would not in any event seriously threaten one of the\r\nfundamentals of the American credit system--which is that credit which is\r\nbased upon banking deposits should be controlled by persons within those\r\nareas which furnish these deposits and thus be subject to the restraints of\r\nlocal interest and public opinion in those areas. To some degree, however,\r\nthis movement of chain or group banking is a groping for stronger support\r\nto the banks and a more secure basis for these institutions.\r\n\r\nThe growth in size and stability of the metropolitan banks is in marked\r\ncontrast to the trend in the country districts, with its many failures and\r\nthe losses these failures have imposed upon the agricultural community.\r\n\r\nThe relinquishment of charters of national banks in great commercial\r\ncenters in favor of State charters indicates that some conditions surround\r\nthe national banks which render them unable to compete with State banks;\r\nand their withdrawal results in weakening our national banking system.\r\n\r\nIt has been proposed that permission should be granted to national banks to\r\nengage in branch banking of a nature that would preserve within limited\r\nregions the local responsibility and the control of such credit\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nAll these subjects, however, require careful investigation, and it might be\r\nfound advantageous to create a joint commission embracing Members of the\r\nCongress and other appropriate Federal officials for subsequent report.\r\n\r\nELECTRICAL POWER REGULATION\r\n\r\nThe Federal Power Commission is now comprised of three Cabinet officers,\r\nand the duties involved in the competent conduct of the growing\r\nresponsibilities of this commission far exceed the time and attention which\r\nthese officials can properly afford from other important duties. I\r\nrecommended that authority be given for the appointment of full-time\r\ncommissioners to replace them.\r\n\r\nIt is also desirable that the authority of the commission should be\r\nextended to certain phases of power regulation. The nature of the electric\r\nutilities industry is such that about 90 per cent of all power generation\r\nand distribution is intrastate in character, and most of the States have\r\ndeveloped their own regulatory systems as to certificates of convenience,\r\nrates, and profits of such utilities. To encroach upon their authorities\r\nand responsibilities would be an encroachment upon the rights of the\r\nStates. There are cases, however, of interstate character beyond the\r\njurisdiction of the States. To meet these cases it would be most desirable\r\nif a method could be worked out by which initial action may be taken\r\nbetween the commissions of the States whose joint action should be made\r\neffective by the Federal Power Commission with a reserve to act on its own\r\nmotion in case of disagreement or nonaction by the States.\r\n\r\nTHE RADIO COMMISSION\r\n\r\nI recommend the reorganization of the Radio Commission into a permanent\r\nbody from its present temporary status. The requirement of the present law\r\nthat the commissioners shall be appointed from specified zones should be\r\nabolished and a general provision made for their equitable selection from\r\ndifferent parts of the country. Despite the effort of the commissioners,\r\nthe present method develops a public insistence that the commissioners are\r\nspecially charged with supervision of radio affairs in the zone from which\r\neach is appointed. As a result there is danger that the system will\r\ndegenerate from a national system into five regional agencies with varying\r\npractices, varying policies, competitive tendencies, and consequent failure\r\nto attain its utmost capacity for service to the people as a whole.\r\n\r\nMUSCLE SHOALS\r\n\r\nIt is most desirable that this question should be disposed of. Under\r\npresent conditions the income from these plants is less than could\r\notherwise be secured for its use, and more especially the public is not\r\nsecuring the full benefits which could be obtained from them.\r\n\r\nIt is my belief that such parts of these plants as would be useful and the\r\nrevenues from the remainder should be dedicated for all time to the farmers\r\nof the United States for investigation and experimentation on a commercial\r\nscale in agricultural chemistry. By such means advancing discoveries of\r\nscience can be systematically applied to agricultural need, and development\r\nof the chemical industry of the Tennessee Valley can be assured.\r\n\r\nI do not favor the operation by the Government of either power or\r\nmanufacturing business except as an unavoidable by-product of some other\r\nmajor public purpose.\r\n\r\nAny form of settlement of this question will imply entering upon a contract\r\nor contracts for the lease of the plants either as a whole or in parts and\r\nthe reservation of facilities, products, or income for agricultural\r\npurposes. The extremely technical and involved nature of such contracts\r\ndealing with chemical and electrical enterprises, added to the unusual\r\ndifficulties surrounding these special plants, and the rapid commercial\r\nchanges now in progress in power and synthetic nitrogen manufacture, lead\r\nme to suggest that Congress create a special commission, not to investigate\r\nand report as in the past, but with authority to negotiate and complete\r\nsome sort of contract or contracts on behalf of the Government, subject, of\r\ncourse, to such general requirements as Congress may stipulate.\r\n\r\nBOULDER DAM\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Interior is making satisfactory progress in\r\nnegotiation of the very complex contracts required for the sale of the\r\npower to be generated at this project. These contracts must assure the\r\nreturn of all Government outlays upon the project. I recommend that the\r\nnecessary funds be appropriated for the initiation of this work as soon as\r\nthe contracts are in the hands of Congress.\r\n\r\nCONSERVATION\r\n\r\nConservation of national resources is a fixed policy of the Government.\r\nThree important questions bearing upon conservation of the public lands\r\nhave become urgent.\r\n\r\nConservation of our oil and gas resources against future need is a national\r\nnecessity. The working of the oil permit system in development of oil and\r\ngas resources on the public domain has been subject to great abuse. I\r\nconsidered it necessary to suspend the issuance of such permits and to\r\ndirect the review of all outstanding permits as to compliance of the\r\nholders with the law. The purpose was not only to end such abuse but to\r\nplace the Government in position to review the entire subject.\r\n\r\nWe are also confronted with a major problem in conservation due to the\r\novergrazing on public lands. The effect of overgrazing (which has now\r\nbecome general) is not only to destroy the ranges but by impairing the\r\nground coverage seriously to menace the water supply in many parts of the\r\nWest through quick run-off, spring floods, and autumn drought.\r\n\r\nWe have a third problem of major dimensions in the reconsideration of our\r\nreclamation policy. The inclusion of most of the available lands of the\r\npublic domain in existing or planned reclamation projects largely completes\r\nthe original purpose of the Reclamation Service. There still remains the\r\nnecessity for extensive storage of water in the arid States which renders\r\nit desirable that we should give a wider vision and purpose to this\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nTo provide for careful consideration of these questions and also of better\r\ndivision of responsibilities in them as between the State and Federal\r\nGovernments, including the possible transfer to the States for school\r\npurposes of the lands unreserved for forests, parks, power, minerals, etc.,\r\nI have appointed a Commission on Conservation of the Public Domain, with a\r\nmembership representing the major public land States and at the same time\r\nthe public at large. I recommend that Congress should authorize a moderate\r\nsum to defray their expenses.\r\n\r\nSOCIAL SERVICE\r\n\r\nThe Federal Government provides for an extensive and valuable program of\r\nconstructive social service, in education, home building, protection to\r\nwomen and children, employment, public health, recreation, and many other\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\nIn a broad sense Federal activity in these directions has been confined to\r\nresearch and dissemination of information and experience, and at most to\r\ntemporary subsidies to the States in order to secure uniform advancement in\r\npractice and methods. Any other attitude by the Federal Government will\r\nundermine one of the most precious possessions of the American people; that\r\nis, local and individual responsibility. We should adhere to this policy.\r\n\r\nFederal officials can, however, make a further and most important\r\ncontribution by leadership in stimulation of the community and voluntary\r\nagencies, and by extending Federal assistance in organization of these\r\nforces and bringing about cooperation among them.\r\n\r\nAs an instance of this character, I have recently, in cooperation with the\r\nSecretaries of Interior and Labor, laid the foundations of an exhaustive\r\ninquiry into the facts precedent to a nation-wide White House conference on\r\nchild health and protection. This cooperative movement among interested\r\nagencies will impose no expense upon the Government. Similar nation-wide\r\nconferences will be called in connection with better housing and recreation\r\nat a later date.\r\n\r\nIn view of the considerable difference of opinion as to the policies which\r\nshould be pursued by the Federal Government with respect to education, I\r\nhave appointed a committee representative of the important educational\r\nassociations and others to investigate and present recommendations. In\r\ncooperation with the Secretary of the Interior, I have also appointed a\r\nvoluntary committee of distinguished membership to assist in a nation-wide\r\nmovement for abolition of illiteracy.\r\n\r\nI have recommended additional appropriations for the Federal employment\r\nservice in order that it may more fully cover its cooperative work with\r\nState and local services. I have also recommended additional appropriations\r\nfor the Women's and Children's Bureaus for much needed research as to facts\r\nwhich I feel will prove most helpful.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC HEALTH\r\n\r\nThe advance in scientific discovery as to disease and health imposes new\r\nconsiderations upon us. The Nation as a whole is vitally interested in the\r\nhealth of all the people; in protection from spread of contagious disease;\r\nin the relation of physical and mental disabilities to criminality; and in\r\nthe economic and moral advancement which is fundamentally associated with\r\nsound body and mind. The organization of preventive measures and health\r\neducation in its personal application is the province of public health\r\nservice. Such organization should be as universal as public education. Its\r\nsupport is a proper burden upon the taxpayer. It can not be organized with\r\nsuccess, either in its sanitary or educational phases, except under public\r\nauthority. It should be based upon local and State responsibility, but I\r\nconsider that the Federal Government has an obligation of contribution to\r\nthe establishment of such agencies.\r\n\r\nIn the practical working out of organization, exhaustive experiment and\r\ntrial have demonstrated that the base should be competent organization of\r\nthe municipality, county, or other local unit. Most of our municipalities\r\nand some 400 rural counties out of 3,000 now have some such unit\r\norganization. Where highly developed, a health unit comprises at least a\r\nphysician, sanitary engineer, and community nurse with the addition, in\r\nsome cases, of another nurse devoted to the problems of maternity and\r\nchildren. Such organization gives at once a fundamental control of\r\npreventive measures and assists in community instruction. The Federal\r\nGovernment, through its interest in control of contagion, acting through\r\nthe United States Public Health Service and the State agencies, has in the\r\npast and should in the future concern itself with this development,\r\nparticularly in the many rural sections which are unfortunately far behind\r\nin progress. Some parts of the funds contributed under the Sheppard-Towner\r\nAct through the Children's Bureau of the Department of Labor have also\r\nfound their way into these channels.\r\n\r\nI recommend to the Congress that the purpose of the Sheppard-Towner Act\r\nshould be continued through the Children's Bureau for a limited period of\r\nyears; and that the Congress should consider the desirability of confining\r\nthe use of Federal funds by the States to the building up of such county or\r\nother local units, and that such outlay should be positively coordinated\r\nwith the funds expended through the United States Public Health Service\r\ndirected to other phases of the same county or other local unit\r\norganization. All funds appropriated should of course be applied through\r\nthe States, so that the public health program of the county or local unit\r\nwill be efficiently coordinated with that of the whole State.\r\n\r\nFEDERAL PRISONS\r\n\r\nClosely related to crime conditions is the administration of the Federal\r\nprison system. Our Federal penal institutions are overcrowded, and this\r\ncondition is daily becoming worse. The parole and probation systems are\r\ninadequate. These conditions make it impossible to perform the work of\r\npersonal reconstruction of prisoners so as to prepare them for return to\r\nthe duties of citizenship. In order to relieve the pressing evils I have\r\ndirected the temporary transfer of the Army Disciplinary Barracks at\r\nLeavenworth to the Department of Justice for use as a Federal prison. Not\r\nonly is this temporary but it is inadequate for present needs.\r\n\r\nWe need some new Federal prisons and a reorganization of our probation and\r\nparole systems; and there should be established in the Department of\r\nJustice a Bureau of Prisons with a sufficient force to deal adequately with\r\nthe growing activities of our prison institutions. Authorization for the\r\nimprovements should be given speedily, with initial appropriations to allow\r\nthe construction of the new institutions to be undertaken at once.\r\nIMMIGRATION\r\n\r\nRestriction of immigration has from every aspect proved a sound national\r\npolicy. Our pressing problem is to formulate a method by which the limited\r\nnumber of immigrants whom we do welcome shall be adapted to our national\r\nsetting and our national needs.\r\n\r\nI have been opposed to the basis of the quotas now in force and I have\r\nhoped that we could find some practical method to secure what I believe\r\nshould be our real national objective; that is, fitness of the immigrant as\r\nto physique, character, training, and our need of service. Perhaps some\r\nsystem of priorities within the quotas could produce these results and at\r\nthe same time enable some hardships in the present system to be cleared up.\r\nI recommend that the Congress should give the subject further study, in\r\nwhich the executive departments will gladly cooperate with the hope of\r\ndiscovering such method as will more fully secure our national necessities.\r\nVETERANS\r\n\r\nIt has been the policy of our Government almost from its inception to make\r\nprovision for the men who have been disabled in defense of our country.\r\nThis policy should be maintained. Originally it took the form of land\r\ngrants and pensions. This system continued until our entry into the World\r\nWar. The Congress at that time inaugurated a new plan of compensation,\r\nrehabilitation, hospitalization, medical care and treatment, and insurance,\r\nwhereby benefits were awarded to those veterans and their immediate\r\ndependents whose disabilities were attributable to their war service. The\r\nbasic principle in this legislation is sound.\r\n\r\nIn a desire to eliminate all possibilities of injustice due to difficulties\r\nin establishing service connection of disabilities, these principles have\r\nbeen to some degree extended. Veterans whose diseases or injuries have\r\nbecome apparent within a brief period after the war are now receiving\r\ncompensation; insurance benefits have been liberalized. Emergency officers\r\nare now receiving additional benefits. The doors of the Government's\r\nhospitals have been opened to all veterans, even though their diseases or\r\ninjuries were not the result of their war service. In addition adjusted\r\nservice certificates have been issued to 3,433,300 veterans. This in itself\r\nwill mean an expenditure of nearly $3,500,000,000 before 1945, in addition\r\nto the $600,000,000 which we are now appropriating annually for our\r\nveterans' relief.\r\n\r\nThe administration of all laws concerning the veterans and their dependents\r\nhas been upon the basis of dealing generously, humanely, and justly. While\r\nsome inequalities have arisen, substantial and adequate care has been given\r\nand justice administered. Further improvement in administration may require\r\nsome amendment from time to time to the law, but care should be taken to\r\nsee that such changes conform to the basic principles of the legislation.\r\n\r\nI am convinced that we will gain in efficiency, economy, and more uniform\r\nadministration and better definition of national policies if the Pension\r\nBureau, the National Home for Volunteer Soldiers, and the Veterans' Bureau\r\nare brought together under a single agency. The total appropriations to\r\nthese agencies now exceed $800,000,000 per annum.\r\n\r\nCIVIL SERVICE\r\n\r\nApproximately four-fifths of all the employees in the executive civil\r\nservice now occupy positions subject to competitive examination under the\r\ncivil service law.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, still commanding opportunities for extending the\r\nsystem. These opportunities lie within the province of Congress and not the\r\nPresident. I recommend that a further step be taken by authorization that\r\nappointments of third-class postmasters be made under the civil service\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENTAL REORGANIZATION\r\n\r\nThis subject has been under consideration for over 20 years. It was\r\npromised by both political parties in the recent campaign. It has been\r\nrepeatedly examined by committees and commissions--congressional,\r\nexecutive, and voluntary. The conclusions of these investigations have been\r\nunanimous that reorganization is a necessity of sound administration; of\r\neconomy; of more effective governmental policies and of relief to the\r\ncitizen from unnecessary harassment in his relations with a multitude of\r\nscattered governmental agencies. But the presentation of any specific plan\r\nat once enlivens opposition from every official whose authority may be\r\ncurtailed or who fears his position is imperiled by such a result; of\r\nbureaus and departments which wish to maintain their authority and\r\nactivities; of citizens and their organizations who are selfishly\r\ninterested, or who are inspired by fear that their favorite bureau may, in\r\na new setting, be less subject to their influence or more subject to some\r\nother influence.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the essential principles of reorganization are two in\r\nnumber. First, all administrative activities of the same major purpose\r\nshould be placed in groups under single-headed responsibility; second, all\r\nexecutive and administrative functions should be separated from boards and\r\ncommissions and placed under individual responsibility, while\r\nquasi-legislative and quasi-judicial and broadly advisory functions should\r\nbe removed from individual authority and assigned to boards and\r\ncommissions. Indeed, these are the fundamental principles upon which our\r\nGovernment was founded, and they are the principles which have been adhered\r\nto in the whole development of our business structure, and they are the\r\ndistillation of the common sense of generations.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the conservation of national resources is spread among eight\r\nagencies in five departments. They suffer from conflict and overlap. There\r\nis no proper development and adherence to broad national policies and no\r\ncentral point where the searchlight of public opinion may concentrate\r\nitself. These functions should be grouped under the direction of some such\r\nofficial as an assistant secretary of conservation. The particular\r\ndepartment or cabinet officer under which such a group should be placed is\r\nof secondary importance to the need of concentration. The same may be said\r\nof educational services, of merchant marine aids, of public works, of\r\npublic health, of veterans' services, and many others, the component parts\r\nof which are widely scattered in the various departments and independent\r\nagencies. It is desirable that we first have experience with these\r\ndifferent groups in action before we create new departments. These may be\r\nnecessary later on.\r\n\r\nWith this background of all previous experience I can see no hope for the\r\ndevelopment of a sound reorganization of the Government unless Congress be\r\nwilling to delegate its authority over the problem (subject to defined\r\nprinciples) to the Executive, who should act upon approval of a joint\r\ncommittee of Congress or with the reservation of power of revision by\r\nCongress within some limited period adequate for its consideration.\r\nPROHIBITION\r\n\r\nThe first duty of the President under his oath of office is to secure the\r\nenforcement of the laws. The enforcement of the laws enacted to give effect\r\nto the eighteenth amendment is far from satisfactory and this is in part\r\ndue to the inadequate organization of the administrative agencies of the\r\nFederal Government. With the hope of expediting such reorganization, I\r\nrequested on June 6 last that Congress should appoint a joint committee to\r\ncollaborate with executive agencies in preparation of legislation. It would\r\nbe helpful if it could be so appointed. The subject has been earnestly\r\nconsidered by the Law Enforcement Commission and the administrative\r\nofficials of the Government. Our joint conclusions are that certain steps\r\nshould be taken at once. First, there should be an immediate concentration\r\nof responsibility and strengthening of enforcement agencies of the Federal\r\nGovernment by transfer to the Department of Justice of the Federal\r\nfunctions of detection and to a considerable degree of prosecution, which\r\nare now lodged in the Prohibition Bureau in the Treasury; and at the same\r\ntime the control of the distribution of industrial alcohol and legalized\r\nbeverages should remain in the Treasury. Second, provision should be made\r\nfor relief of congestion in the Federal courts by modifying and simplifying\r\nthe procedure for dealing with the large volume of petty prosecutions under\r\nvarious Federal acts. Third, there should be a codification of the laws\r\nrelating to prohibition to avoid the necessity which now exists of\r\nresorting to more than 25 statutes enacted at various times over 40 years.\r\nTechnical defects in these statutes that have been disclosed should be\r\ncured. I would add to these recommendations the desirability of\r\nreorganizing the various services engaged in the prevention of smuggling\r\ninto one border patrol under the Coast Guard. Further recommendations upon\r\nthe subject as a whole will be developed after further examination by the\r\nLaw Enforcement Commission, but it is not to be expected that any criminal\r\nlaw will ever be fully enforced so long as criminals exist.\r\n\r\nThe District of Columbia should be the model of city law enforcement in the\r\nNation. While conditions here are much better than in many other cities,\r\nthey are far from perfect, and this is due in part to the congestion of\r\ncriminal cases in the Supreme Court of the District, resulting in long\r\ndelays. Furthermore, there is need for legislation in the District\r\nsupplementing the national prohibition act, more sharply defining and\r\nenlarging the duties and powers of the District Commissioners and the\r\npolice of the District, and opening the way for better cooperation in the\r\nenforcement of prohibition between the District officials and the\r\nprohibition officers of the Federal Government. It is urgent that these\r\nconditions be remedied.\r\n\r\nLAW ENFORCEMENT AND OBSERVANCE\r\n\r\nNo one will look with satisfaction upon the volume of crime of all kinds\r\nand the growth of organized crime in our country. We have pressing need so\r\nto organize our system of administering criminal justice as to establish\r\nfull vigor and effectiveness. We need to reestablish faith that the highest\r\ninterests of our country are served by insistence upon the swift and\r\neven-handed administration of justice to all offenders, whether they be\r\nrich or poor. That we shall effect improvement is vital to the preservation\r\nof our institutions. It is the most serious issue before our people.\r\n\r\nUnder the authority of Congress I have appointed a National Commission on\r\nLaw Observance and Enforcement, for an exhaustive study of the entire\r\nproblem of the enforcement of our laws and the improvement of our judicial\r\nsystem, including the special problems and abuses growing out of the\r\nprohibition laws. The commission has been invited to make the widest\r\ninquiry into the shortcomings of the administration of justice and into the\r\ncauses and remedies for them. It has organized its work under subcommittees\r\ndealing with the many contributory causes of our situation and has enlisted\r\nthe aid of investigators in fields requiring special consideration. I am\r\nconfident that as a result of its studies now being carried forward it will\r\nmake a notable contribution to the solution of our pressing problems.\r\n\r\nPending further legislation, the Department of Justice has been striving to\r\nweed out inefficiency wherever it exists, to stimulate activity on the part\r\nof its prosecuting officers, and to use increasing care in examining into\r\nthe qualifications of those appointed to serve as prosecutors. The\r\ndepartment is seeking systematically to strengthen the law enforcement\r\nagencies week by week and month by month, not by dramatic displays but by\r\nsteady pressure; by removal of negligent officials and by encouragement and\r\nassistance to the vigilant. During the course of these efforts it has been\r\nrevealed that in some districts causes contributing to the congestion of\r\ncriminal dockets, and to delays and inefficiency in prosecutions, have been\r\nlack of sufficient forces in the offices of United States attorneys, clerks\r\nof courts, and marshals. These conditions tend to clog the machinery of\r\njustice. The last conference of senior circuit judges has taken note of\r\nthem and indorsed the department's proposals for improvement. Increases in\r\nappropriations are necessary and will be asked for in order to reenforce\r\nthese offices.\r\n\r\nThe orderly administration of the law involves more than the mere machinery\r\nof law enforcement. The efficient use of that machinery and a spirit in our\r\npeople in support of law are alike essential. We have need for improvement\r\nin both. However much we may perfect the mechanism, still if the citizen\r\nwho is himself dependent upon some laws for the protection of all that he\r\nhas and all that he holds dear, shall insist on selecting the particular\r\nlaws which he will obey, he undermines his own safety and that of his\r\ncountry. His attitude may obscure, but it can not conceal, the ugly truth\r\nthat the lawbreaker, whoever he may be, is the enemy of society. We can no\r\nlonger gloss over the unpleasant reality which should be made vital in the\r\nconsciousness of every citizen, that he who condones or traffics with\r\ncrime, who is indifferent to it and to the punishment of the criminal, or\r\nto the lax performance of official duty, is himself the most effective\r\nagency for the breakdown of society.\r\n\r\nLaw can not rise above its source in good citizenship--in what right-minded\r\nmen most earnestly believe and desire. If the law is upheld only by\r\nGovernment officials, then all law is at an end. Our laws are made by the\r\npeople themselves; theirs is the right to work for their repeal; but until\r\nrepeal it is an equal duty to observe them and demand their enforcement.\r\n\r\nI have been gratified at the awakening sense of this responsibility in our\r\ncitizens during the past few months, and gratified that many instances have\r\noccurred which refuted the cynicism which has asserted that our system\r\ncould not convict those who had defied the law and possessed the means to\r\nresist its execution. These things reveal a moral awakening both in the\r\npeople and in officials which lies at the very foundation of the rule of\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe test of the rightfulness of our decisions must be whether we have\r\nsustained and advanced the ideals of the American people; self-government\r\nin its foundations of local government; justice whether to the individual\r\nor to the group; ordered liberty; freedom from domination; open opportunity\r\nand equality of opportunity; the initiative and individuality of our\r\npeople; prosperity and the lessening of poverty; freedom of public opinion;\r\neducation; advancement of knowledge; the growth of religious spirit; the\r\ntolerance of all faiths; the foundations of the home and the advancement of\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nThe White House,\r\n\r\nDecember 3, 1929\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nHerbert Hoover\r\nDecember 2, 1930\r\n\r\nTo the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nI have the honor to comply with the requirement of the Constitution that I\r\nshould lay before the Congress information as to the state of the Union,\r\nand recommend consideration of such measures as are necessary and\r\nexpedient.\r\n\r\nSubstantial progress has been made during the year in national peace and\r\nsecurity; the fundamental strength of the Nation's economic life is\r\nunimpaired; education and scientific discovery have made advances; our\r\ncountry is more alive to its problems of moral and spiritual welfare.\r\n\r\nECONOMIC SITUATION\r\n\r\nDuring the past 12 months we have suffered with other Nations from economic\r\ndepression.\r\n\r\nThe origins of this depression lie to some extent within our own borders\r\nthrough a speculative period which diverted capital and energy into\r\nspeculation rather than constructive enterprise. Had overspeculation in\r\nsecurities been the only force operating, we should have seen recovery many\r\nmonths ago, as these particular dislocations have generally readjusted\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nOther deep-seated causes have been in action, however, chiefly the\r\nworld-wide overproduction beyond even the demand of prosperous times for\r\nsuch important basic commodities as wheat, rubber, coffee, sugar, copper,\r\nsilver, zinc, to some extent cotton, and other raw materials. The\r\ncumulative effects of demoralizing price falls of these important\r\ncommodities in the process of adjustment of production to world consumption\r\nhave produced financial crises in many countries and have diminished the\r\nbuying power of these countries for imported goods to a degree which\r\nextended the difficulties farther afield by creating unemployment in all\r\nthe industrial nations. The political agitation in Asia; revolutions in\r\nSouth America and political unrest in some European States; the methods of\r\nsale by Russia of her increasing agricultural exports to European markets;\r\nand our own drought--have all contributed to prolong and deepen the\r\ndepression.\r\n\r\nIn the larger view the major forces of the depression now lie outside of\r\nthe United States, and our recuperation has been retarded by the\r\nunwarranted degree of fear and apprehension created by these outside\r\nforces.\r\n\r\nThe extent of the depression is indicated by the following approximate\r\npercentages of activity during the past three months as compared with the\r\nhighly prosperous year of 1928:\r\n\r\nValue of department-store sales - 93% of 1928\r\n\r\nVolume of manufacturing production - 80% of 1928\r\n\r\nVolume of mineral production - 90% of 1928\r\n\r\nVolume of factory employment - 84% of 1928\r\n\r\nTotal of bank deposits - 105% of 1928\r\n\r\nWholesale prices--all commodities - 83% of 1928\r\n\r\nCost of living - 94% of 1928\r\n\r\nVarious other indexes indicate total decrease of activity from 1928 of from\r\n15 to 20 per cent.\r\n\r\nThere are many factors which give encouragement for the future. The fact\r\nthat we are holding from 80 to 85 per cent of our normal activities and\r\nincomes; that our major financial and industrial institutions have come\r\nthrough the storm unimpaired; that price levels of major commodities have\r\nremained approximately stable for some time; that a number of industries\r\nare showing signs of increasing demand; that the world at large is\r\nreadjusting itself to the situation; all reflect grounds for confidence. We\r\nshould remember that these occasions have been met many times before, that\r\nthey are but temporary, that our country is to-day stronger and richer in\r\nresources, in equipment, in skill, than ever in its history. We are in an\r\nextraordinary degree self-sustaining, we will overcome world influences and\r\nwill lead the march of prosperity as we have always done hitherto.\r\n\r\nEconomic depression can not be cured by legislative action or executive\r\npronouncement. Economic wounds must be healed by the action of the cells of\r\nthe economic body--the producers and consumers themselves. Recovery can be\r\nexpedited and its effects mitigated by cooperative action. That cooperation\r\nrequires that every individual should sustain faith and courage; that each\r\nshould maintain his self-reliance; that each and every one should search\r\nfor methods of improving his business or service; that the vast majority\r\nwhose income is unimpaired should not hoard out of fear but should pursue\r\ntheir normal living and recreations; that each should seek to assist his\r\nneighbors who may be less fortunate; that each industry should assist its\r\nown employees; that each community and each State should assume its full\r\nresponsibilities for organization of employment and relief of distress with\r\nthat sturdiness and independence which built a great Nation.\r\n\r\nOur people are responding to these impulses in remarkable degree. The best\r\ncontribution of government lies in encouragement of this voluntary\r\ncooperation in the community. The Government, National, State, and local,\r\ncan join with the community in such programs and do its part. A year ago I,\r\ntogether with other officers of the Government, initiated extensive\r\ncooperative measures throughout the country.\r\n\r\nThe first of these measures was an agreement of leading employers to\r\nmaintain the standards of wages and of labor leaders to use their influence\r\nagainst strife. In a large sense these undertakings have been adhered to\r\nand we have not witnessed the usual reductions of wages which have always\r\nheretofore marked depressions. The index of union wage scales shows them to\r\nbe today fully up to the level of any of the previous three years. In\r\nconsequence the buying power of the country has been much larger than would\r\notherwise have been the case. Of equal importance the Nation has had\r\nunusual peace in industry and freedom from the public disorder which has\r\ncharacterized previous depressions.\r\n\r\nThe second direction of cooperation has been that our governments,\r\nNational, State, and local, the industries and business so distribute\r\nemployment as to give work to the maximum number of employees.\r\n\r\nThe third direction of cooperation has been to maintain and even extend\r\nconstruction work and betterments in anticipation of the future. It has\r\nbeen the universal experience in previous depressions that public works and\r\nprivate construction have fallen off rapidly with the general tide of\r\ndepression. On this occasion, however, the increased authorization and\r\ngenerous appropriations by the Congress and the action of States and\r\nmunicipalities have resulted in the expansion of public construction to an\r\namount even above that in the most prosperous years. In addition the\r\ncooperation of public utilities, railways, and other large organizations\r\nhas been generously given in construction and betterment work in\r\nanticipation of future need. The Department of Commerce advises me that as\r\na result, the volume of this type of construction work, which amounted to\r\nroughly $6,300,000,000 in 1929, instead of decreasing will show a total of\r\nabout $7,000,000,000 for 1930. There has, of course, been a substantial\r\ndecrease in the types of construction which could not be undertaken in\r\nadvance of need.\r\n\r\nThe fourth direction of cooperation was the organization in such States and\r\nmunicipalities, as was deemed necessary, of committees to organize local\r\nemployment, to provide for employment agencies, and to effect relief of\r\ndistress.\r\n\r\nThe result of magnificent cooperation throughout the country has been that\r\nactual suffering has been kept to a minimum during the past 12 months, and\r\nour unemployment has been far less in proportion than in other large\r\nindustrial countries. Some time ago it became evident that unemployment\r\nwould continue over the winter and would necessarily be added to from\r\nseasonal causes and that the savings of workpeople would be more largely\r\ndepleted. We have as a Nation a definite duty to see that no deserving\r\nperson in our country suffers from hunger or cold. I therefore set up a\r\nmore extensive organization to stimulate more intensive cooperation\r\nthroughout the country. There has been a most gratifying degree of\r\nresponse, from governors, mayors, and other public officials, from welfare\r\norganizations, and from employers in concerns both large and small. The\r\nlocal communities through their voluntary agencies have assumed the duty of\r\nrelieving individual distress and are being generously supported by the\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nThe number of those wholly out of employment seeking for work was\r\naccurately determined by the census last April as about 2,500,000. The\r\nDepartment of Labor index of employment in the larger trades shows some\r\ndecrease in employment since that time. The problem from a relief point of\r\nview is somewhat less than the published estimates of the number of\r\nunemployed would indicate. The intensive community and individual efforts\r\nin providing special employment outside the listed industries are not\r\nreflected in the statistical indexes and tend to reduce such published\r\nfigures. Moreover, there is estimated to be a constant figure at all times\r\nof nearly 1,000,000 unemployed who are not without annual income but\r\ntemporarily idle in the shift from one job to another. We have an average\r\nof about three breadwinners to each two families, so that every person\r\nunemployed does not represent a family without income. The view that the\r\nrelief problems are less than the gross numbers would indicate is confirmed\r\nby the experience of several cities, which shows that the number of\r\nfamilies in distress represents from 10 to 20 per cent of the number of the\r\ncalculated unemployed. This is not said to minimize the very real problem\r\nwhich exists but to weigh its actual proportions.\r\n\r\nAs a contribution to the situation the Federal Government is engaged upon\r\nthe greatest program of waterway, harbor, flood control, public building,\r\nhighway, and airway improvement in all our history. This, together with\r\nloans to merchant shipbuilders, improvement of the Navy and in military\r\naviation, and other construction work of the Government will exceed\r\n$520,000,000 for this fiscal year. This compares with $253,000,000 in the\r\nfiscal year 1928. The construction works already authorized and the\r\ncontinuation of policies in Government aid will require a continual\r\nexpenditure upwards of half a billion dollars annually.\r\n\r\nI favor still further temporary expansion of these activities in aid to\r\nunemployment during this winter. The Congress will, however, have presented\r\nto it numbers of projects, some of them under the guise of, rather than the\r\nreality of, their usefulness in the increase of employment during the\r\ndepression. There are certain commonsense limitations upon any expansions\r\nof construction work. The Government must not undertake works that are not\r\nof sound economic purpose and that have not been subject to searching\r\ntechnical investigation, and which have not been given adequate\r\nconsideration by the Congress. The volume of construction work in the\r\nGovernment is already at the maximum limit warranted by financial prudence\r\nas a continuing policy. To increase taxation for purposes of construction\r\nwork defeats its own purpose, as such taxes directly diminish employment in\r\nprivate industry. Again any kind of construction requires, after its\r\nauthorization, a considerable time before labor can be employed in which to\r\nmake engineering, architectural, and legal preparations. Our immediate\r\nproblem is the increase of employment for the next six months, and new\r\nplans which do not produce such immediate result or which extend\r\ncommitments beyond this period are not warranted.\r\n\r\nThe enlarged rivers and harbors, public building, and highway plans\r\nauthorized by the Congress last session, however, offer an opportunity for\r\nassistance by the temporary acceleration of construction of these programs\r\neven faster than originally planned, especially if the technical\r\nrequirements of the laws which entail great delays could be amended in such\r\nfashion as to speed up acquirements of land and the letting of contracts.\r\n\r\nWith view, however, to the possible need for acceleration, we, immediately\r\nupon receiving those authorities from the Congress five months ago, began\r\nthe necessary technical work in preparation for such possible eventuality.\r\nI have canvassed the departments of the Government as to the maximum amount\r\nthat can be properly added to our present expenditure to accelerate all\r\nconstruction during the next six months, and I feel warranted in asking the\r\nCongress for an appropriation of from $100,000,000 to $150,000,000 to\r\nprovide such further employment in this emergency. In connection therewith\r\nwe need some authority to make enlarged temporary advances of\r\nFederal-highway aid to the States.\r\n\r\nI recommend that this appropriation be made distributable to the different\r\ndepartments upon recommendation of a committee of the Cabinet and approval\r\nby the President. Its application to works already authorized by the\r\nCongress assures its use in directions of economic importance and to public\r\nwelfare. Such action will imply an expenditure upon construction of all\r\nkinds of over $650,000,000 during the next twelve months.\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURE\r\n\r\nThe world-wide depression has affected agriculture in common with all other\r\nindustries. The average price of farm produce has fallen to about 80 per\r\ncent of the levels of 1928. This average is, however, greatly affected by\r\nwheat and cotton, which have participated in world-wide overproduction and\r\nhave fallen to about 60 per cent of the average price of the year 1928.\r\nExcluding these commodities, the prices of all other agricultural products\r\nare about 84 per cent of those of 1928. The average wholesale prices of\r\nother primary goods, such as nonferrous metals, have fallen to 76 per cent\r\nof 1928.\r\n\r\nThe price levels of our major agricultural commodities are, in fact, higher\r\nthan those in other principal producing countries, due to the combined\r\nresult of the tariff and the operations of the Farm Board. For instance,\r\nwheat prices at Minneapolis are about 30 per cent higher than at Winnipeg,\r\nand at Chicago they are about 20 per cent higher than at Buenos Aires. Corn\r\nprices at Chicago are over twice as high as at Buenos Aires. Wool prices\r\naverage more than 80 per cent higher in this country than abroad, and\r\nbutter is 30 per cent higher in New York City than in Copenhagen.\r\n\r\nAside from the misfortune to agriculture of the world-wide depression we\r\nhave had the most severe drought. It has affected particularly the States\r\nbordering on the Potomac, Ohio, and Lower Mississippi Rivers, with some\r\nareas in Montana, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. It has found its major\r\nexpression in the shortage of pasturage and a shrinkage in the corn crop\r\nfrom an average of about 2,800,000,000 bushels to about 2,090,000,000\r\nbushels.\r\n\r\nOn August 14 I called a conference of the governors of the most acutely\r\naffected States, and as a result of its conclusions I appointed a national\r\ncommittee comprising the heads of the important Federal agencies under the\r\nchairmanship of the Secretary of Agriculture. The governors in turn have\r\nappointed State committees representative of the farmers, bankers, business\r\nmen, and the Red Cross, and subsidiary committees have been established in\r\nmost of the acutely affected counties. Railway rates were reduced on feed\r\nand livestock in and out of the drought areas, and over 50,000 cars of such\r\nproducts have been transported under these reduced rates. The Red Cross\r\nestablished a preliminary fund of $5,000,000 for distress relief purposes\r\nand established agencies for its administration in each county. Of this\r\nfund less than $500,000 has been called for up to this time as the need\r\nwill appear more largely during the winter. The Federal Farm Loan Board has\r\nextended its credit facilities, and the Federal Farm Board has given\r\nfinancial assistance to all affected cooperatives.\r\n\r\nIn order that the Government may meet its full obligation toward our\r\ncountrymen in distress through no fault of their own, I recommend that an\r\nappropriation should be made to the Department of Agriculture to be loaned\r\nfor the purpose of seed and feed for animals. Its application should as\r\nhitherto in such loans be limited to a gross amount to any one individual,\r\nand secured upon the crop.\r\n\r\nThe Red Cross can relieve the cases of individual distress by the\r\nsympathetic assistance of our people.\r\n\r\nFINANCES OF THE GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nI shall submit the detailed financial position of the Government with\r\nrecommendations in the usual Budget message. I will at this time, however,\r\nmention that the Budget estimates of receipts and expenditures for the\r\ncurrent year were formulated by the Treasury and the Budget Bureau at a\r\ntime when it was impossible to forecast the severity of the business\r\ndepression and have been most seriously affected by it. At that time a\r\nsurplus of about $123,000,000 was estimated for this fiscal year and tax\r\nreduction which affected the fiscal year to the extent of $75,000,000 was\r\nauthorized by the Congress, thus reducing the estimated surplus to about\r\n$48,000,000. Closely revised estimates now made by the Treasury and the\r\nBureau of the Budget of the tax, postal, and other receipts for the current\r\nfiscal year indicate a decrease of about $430,000,000 from the estimate of\r\na year ago, of which about $75,000,000 is due to tax reduction, leaving\r\nabout $355,000,000 due to the depression. Moreover, legislation enacted by\r\nCongress subsequent to the submission of the Budget enlarging Federal\r\nconstruction work to expand employment and for increase in veterans'\r\nservices and other items, have increased expenditures during the current\r\nfiscal year by about $225,000,000.\r\n\r\nThus the decrease of $430,000,000 in revenue and the increase of\r\n$225,000,000 in expenditure adversely change the original Budget situation\r\nby about $655,000,000. This large sum is offset by the original estimated\r\nsurplus a year ago of about $123,000,000, by the application of\r\n$185,000,000 of interest payments upon the foreign debt to current\r\nexpenditures, by arrangements of the Farm Board through repayments, etc.,\r\nin consequence of which they reduced their net cash demands upon the\r\nTreasury by $100,000,000 in this period, and by about $67,000,000 economies\r\nand deferments brought about in the Government, thus reducing the practical\r\neffect of the change in the situation to an estimated deficit of about\r\n$180,000,000 for the present fiscal year. I shall make suggestions for\r\nhandling the present-year deficit in the Budget message, but I do not favor\r\nencroachment upon the statutory reduction of the public debt.\r\n\r\nWhile it will be necessary in public interest to further increase\r\nexpenditures during the current fiscal year in aid to unemployment by\r\nspeeding up construction work and aid to the farmers affected by the\r\ndrought, I can not emphasize too strongly the absolute necessity to defer\r\nany other plans for increase of Government expenditures. The Budget for\r\n1932 fiscal year indicates estimated expenditure of about $4,054,000,000,\r\nincluding postal deficit. The receipts are estimated at about\r\n$4,085,000,000 if the temporary tax reduction of last year be discontinued,\r\nleaving a surplus of only about $30,000,000. Most rigid economy is\r\ntherefore necessary to avoid increase in taxes.\r\n\r\nNATIONAL DEFENSE\r\n\r\nOur Army and Navy are being maintained at a high state of efficiency, under\r\nofficers of high training and intelligence, supported by a devoted\r\npersonnel of the rank and file. The London naval treaty has brought\r\nimportant economies in the conduct of the Navy. The Navy Department will\r\nlay before the committees of the Congress recommendations for a program of\r\nauthorization of new construction which should be initiated in the fiscal\r\nyear of 1932.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATION\r\n\r\nThis is the last session of the Seventy-first Congress. During its previous\r\nsittings it has completed a very large amount of important legislation,\r\nnotably: The establishment of the Federal Farm Board; fixing congressional\r\nreapportionment; revision of the tariff, including the flexible provisions\r\nand a reorganization of the Tariff Commission; reorganization of the Radio\r\nCommission; reorganization of the Federal Power Commission; expansion of\r\nFederal prisons; reorganization of parole and probation system in Federal\r\nprisons; expansion of veterans' hospitals; establishment of disability\r\nallowances to veterans; consolidation of veteran activities; consolidation\r\nand strengthening of prohibition enforcement activities in the Department\r\nof Justice; organization of a Narcotics Bureau; large expansion of rivers\r\nand harbors improvements; substantial increase in Federal highways;\r\nenlargement of public buildings construction program; and the ratification\r\nof the London naval treaty.\r\n\r\nThe Congress has before it legislation partially completed in the last\r\nsitting in respect to Muscle Shoals, bus regulation, relief of congestion\r\nin the courts, reorganization of border patrol in prevention of smuggling,\r\nlaw enforcement in the District of Columbia, and other subjects.\r\n\r\nIt is desirable that these measures should be completed.\r\n\r\nThe short session does not permit of extensive legislative programs, but\r\nthere are a number of questions which, if time does not permit action, I\r\nrecommend should be placed in consideration by the Congress, perhaps\r\nthrough committees cooperating in some instances with the Federal\r\ndepartments, with view to preparation for subsequent action. Among them are\r\nthe following subjects:\r\n\r\nELECTRICAL POWER\r\n\r\nI have in a previous message recommended effective regulation of interstate\r\nelectrical power. Such regulation should preserve the independence and\r\nresponsibility of the States.\r\n\r\nRAILWAYS\r\n\r\nWe have determined upon a national policy of consolidation of the railways\r\nas a necessity of more stable and more economically operated\r\ntransportation. Further legislation is necessary to facilitate such\r\nconsolidation. In the public interest we should strengthen the railways\r\nthat they may meet our future needs.\r\n\r\nANTITRUST LAWS\r\n\r\nI recommend that the Congress institute an inquiry into some aspects of the\r\neconomic working of these laws. I do not favor repeal of the Sherman Act.\r\nThe prevention of monopolies is of most vital public importance.\r\nCompetition is not only the basis of protection to the consumer but is the\r\nincentive to progress. However, the interpretation of these laws by the\r\ncourts, the changes in business, especially in the economic effects upon\r\nthose enterprises closely related to the use of the natural resources of\r\nthe country, make such an inquiry advisable. The producers of these\r\nmaterials assert that certain unfortunate results of wasteful and\r\ndestructive use of these natural resources together with a destructive\r\ncompetition which impoverishes both operator and worker can not be remedied\r\nbecause of the prohibitive interpretation of the antitrust laws. The\r\nwell-known condition of the bituminous coal industry is an illustration.\r\nThe people have a vital interest in the conservation of their natural\r\nresources; in the prevention of wasteful practices; in conditions of\r\ndestructive competition which may impoverish the producer and the wage\r\nearner; and they have an equal interest in maintaining adequate\r\ncompetition. I therefore suggest that an inquiry be directed especially to\r\nthe effect of the workings of the antitrust laws in these particular fields\r\nto determine if these evils can be remedied without sacrifice of the\r\nfundamental purpose of these laws.\r\n\r\nCAPITAL-GAINS TAX\r\n\r\nIt is urged by many thoughtful citizens that the peculiar economic effect\r\nof the income tax on so-called capital gains at the present rate is to\r\nenhance speculative inflation and likewise impede business recovery. I\r\nbelieve this to be the case and I recommend that a study be made of the\r\neconomic effects of this tax and of its relation to the general structure\r\nof our income tax law.\r\n\r\nIMMIGRATION\r\n\r\nThere is need for revision of our immigration laws upon a more limited and\r\nmore selective basis, flexible to the needs of the country.\r\n\r\nUnder conditions of current unemployment it is obvious that persons coming\r\nto the United States seeking work would likely become either a direct or\r\nindirect public charge. As a temporary measure the officers issuing visas\r\nto immigrants have been, in pursuance of the law, instructed to refuse\r\nvisas to applicants likely to fall into this class. As a result the visas\r\nissued have decreased from an average of about 24,000 per month prior to\r\nrestrictions to a rate of about 7,000 during the last month. These are\r\nlargely preferred persons under the law. Visas from Mexico are about 250\r\nper month compared to about 4,000 previous to restrictions. The whole\r\nsubject requires exhaustive reconsideration.\r\n\r\nDEPORTATION OF ALIEN CRIMINALS\r\n\r\nI urge the strengthening of our deportation laws so as to more fully rid\r\nourselves of criminal aliens. Furthermore, thousands of persons have\r\nentered the country in violation of the immigration laws. The very method\r\nof their entry indicates their objectionable character, and our law-abiding\r\nforeign-born residents suffer in consequence. I recommend that the Congress\r\nprovide methods of strengthening the Government to correct this abuse.\r\n\r\nPOST OFFICE\r\n\r\nDue to deferment of Government building over many years, previous\r\nadministrations had been compelled to enter upon types of leases for\r\nsecondary facilities in large cities, some of which were objectionable as\r\nrepresenting too high a return upon the value of the property. To prevent\r\nthe occasion for further uneconomic leasing I recommend that the Congress\r\nauthorize the building by the Government of its own facilities.\r\n\r\nVETERANS\r\n\r\nThe Nation has generously expanded its care for veterans. The consolidation\r\nof all veterans' activities into the Veterans' Administration has produced\r\nsubstantial administrative economies. The consolidation also brings\r\nemphasis to the inequalities in service and allowances. The whole subject\r\nis under study by the administrator, and I recommend it should also be\r\nexamined by the committees of the Congress.\r\n\r\nSOCIAL SERVICE\r\n\r\nI urge further consideration by the Congress of the recommendations I made\r\na year ago looking to the development through temporary Federal aid of\r\nadequate State and local services for the health of children and the\r\nfurther stamping out of communicable disease, particularly in the rural\r\nsections. The advance of scientific discovery, methods, and social thought\r\nimposes a new vision in these matters. The drain upon the Federal Treasury\r\nis comparatively small. The results both economic and moral are of the\r\nutmost importance.\r\n\r\nGENERAL\r\n\r\nIt is my belief that after the passing of this depression, when we can\r\nexamine it in retrospect, we shall need to consider a number of other\r\nquestions as to what action may be taken by the Government to remove\r\nPossible governmental influences which make for instability and to better\r\norganize mitigation of the effect of depression. It is as yet too soon to\r\nconstructively formulate such measures.\r\n\r\nThere are many administrative subjects, such as departmental\r\nreorganization, extension of the civil service, readjustment of the postal\r\nrates, etc., which at some appropriate time require the attention of the\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nFOREIGN RELATIONS\r\n\r\nOur relations with foreign countries have been maintained upon a high basis\r\nof cordiality and good will.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year the London naval pact was completed, approved by the\r\nSenate, and ratified by the governments concerned. By this treaty we have\r\nabolished competition in the building of warships, have established the\r\nbasis of parity of the United States with the strongest of foreign powers,\r\nand have accomplished a substantial reduction in war vessels.\r\n\r\nDuring the year there has been an extended political unrest in the world.\r\nAsia continues in disturbed condition, and revolutions have taken place in\r\nBrazil, Argentina, Peru, and Bolivia. Despite the jeopardy to our citizens\r\nand their property which naturally arises in such circumstances, we have,\r\nwith the cooperation of the governments concerned, been able to meet all\r\nsuch instances without friction.\r\n\r\nWe have resumed normal relations with the new Governments of Brazil,\r\nArgentina, Peru, and Bolivia immediately upon evidence that they were able\r\nto give protection to our citizens and their property, and that they\r\nrecognized their international obligations.\r\n\r\nA commission which was supported by the Congress has completed its\r\ninvestigation and reported upon our future policies in respect to Haiti and\r\nproved of high value in securing the acceptance of these policies. An\r\nelection has been held and a new government established. We have replaced\r\nour high commissioner by a minister and have begun the gradual withdrawal\r\nof our activities with view to complete retirement at the expiration of the\r\npresent treaty in 1935.\r\n\r\nA number of arbitration and conciliation treaties have been completed or\r\nnegotiated during the year, and will be presented for approval by the\r\nSenate.\r\n\r\nI shall, in a special message, lay before the Senate the protocols covering\r\nthe statutes of the World Court which have been revised to accord with the\r\nsense of previous Senate reservations.\r\n\r\nThe White House,\r\n\r\nDecember 2, 1930\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nHerbert Hoover\r\nDecember 8, 1931\r\n\r\nTo the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nIt is my duty under the Constitution to transmit to the Congress\r\ninformation on the state of the Union and to recommend for its\r\nconsideration necessary and expedient measures.\r\n\r\nThe chief influence affecting the state of the Union during the past year\r\nhas been the continued world-wide economic disturbance. Our national\r\nconcern has been to meet the emergencies it has created for us and to lay\r\nthe foundations for recovery.\r\n\r\nIf we lift our vision beyond these immediate emergencies we find\r\nfundamental national gains even amid depression. In meeting the problems of\r\nthis difficult period, we have witnessed a remarkable development of the\r\nsense of cooperation in the community. For the first time in the history of\r\nour major economic depressions there has been a notable absence of public\r\ndisorders and industrial conflict. Above all there is an enlargement of\r\nsocial and spiritual responsibility among the people. The strains and\r\nstresses upon business have resulted in closer application, in saner\r\npolicies, and in better methods. Public improvements have been carried out\r\non a larger scale than even in normal times. The country is richer in\r\nphysical property, in newly discovered resources, and in productive\r\ncapacity than ever before. There has been constant gain in knowledge and\r\neducation; there has been continuous advance in science and invention;\r\nthere has been distinct gain in public health. Business depressions have\r\nbeen recurrent in the life of our country and are but transitory. The\r\nNation has emerged from each of them with increased strength and virility\r\nbecause of the enlightenment they have brought, the readjustments and the\r\nlarger understanding of the realities and obligations of life and work\r\nwhich come from them.\r\n\r\nNATIONAL DEFENSE\r\n\r\nBoth our Army and Navy have been maintained in a high state of efficiency.\r\nThe ability and devotion of both officers and men sustain the highest\r\ntraditions of the service. Reductions and postponements in expenditure of\r\nthese departments to meet the present emergency are being made without\r\nreducing existing personnel or impairing the morale of either\r\nestablishment.\r\n\r\nThe agreement between the leading naval powers for limitation of naval\r\narmaments and establishment of their relative strength and thus elimination\r\nof competitive building also implies for ourselves the gradual expansion of\r\nthe deficient categories in our Navy to the parities provided in those\r\ntreaties. However, none of the other nations, parties to these agreements,\r\nis to-day maintaining the full rate of construction which the treaty size\r\nof fleets would imply.\r\n\r\nAlthough these agreements secured the maximum reduction of fleets which it\r\nwas at that time possible to attain, I am hopeful that the naval powers,\r\nparty to these agreements, will realize that establishment of relative\r\nstrength in itself offers opportunity for further reduction without injury\r\nto any of them. This would be the more possible if pending negotiations are\r\nsuccessful between France and Italy. If the world is to regain its\r\nstandards of life, it must further decrease both naval and other arms. The\r\nsubject will come before the General Disarmament Conference which meets in\r\nGeneva on February 2.\r\n\r\nFOREIGN AFFAIRS\r\n\r\nWe are at peace with the world. We have cooperated with other nations to\r\npreserve peace. The rights of our citizens abroad have been protected.\r\n\r\nThe economic depression has continued and deepened in every part of the\r\nworld during the past year. In many countries political instability,\r\nexcessive armaments, debts, governmental expenditures, and taxes have\r\nresulted in revolutions, in unbalanced budgets and monetary collapse and\r\nfinancial panics, in dumping of goods upon world markets, and in diminished\r\nconsumption of commodities.\r\n\r\nWithin two years there have been revolutions or acute social disorders in\r\n19 countries, embracing more than half the population of the world. Ten\r\ncountries have been unable to meet their external obligations. In 14\r\ncountries, embracing a quarter of the world's population, former monetary\r\nstandards have been temporarily abandoned. In a number of countries there\r\nhave been acute financial panics or compulsory restraints upon banking.\r\nThese disturbances have many roots in the dislocations from the World War.\r\nEvery one of them has reacted upon us. They have sharply affected the\r\nmarkets and prices of our agricultural and industrial products. They have\r\nincreased unemployment and greatly embarrassed our financial and credit\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nAs our difficulties during the past year have plainly originated in large\r\ndegree from these sources, any effort to bring about our own recuperation\r\nhas dictated the necessity of cooperation by us with other nations in\r\nreasonable effort to restore world confidence and economic stability.\r\n\r\nCooperation of our Federal reserve system and our banks with the central\r\nbanks in foreign countries has contributed to localize and ameliorate a\r\nnumber of serious financial crises or moderate the pressures upon us and\r\nthus avert disasters which would have affected us.\r\n\r\nThe economic crisis in Germany and Central Europe last June rose to the\r\ndimensions of a general panic from which it was apparent that without\r\nassistance these nations must collapse. Apprehensions of such collapse had\r\ndemoralized our agricultural and security markets and so threatened other\r\nnations as to impose further dangers upon us. But of highest importance was\r\nthe necessity of cooperation on our part to relieve the people of Germany\r\nfrom imminent disasters and to maintain their important relations to\r\nprogress and stability in the world. Upon the initiative of this Government\r\na year's postponement of reparations and other intergovernmental debts was\r\nbrought about. Upon our further initiative an agreement was made by\r\nGermany's private creditors providing for an extension of such credits\r\nuntil the German people can develop more permanent and definite forms of\r\nrelief.\r\n\r\nWe have continued our policy of withdrawing our marines from Haiti and\r\nNicaragua.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties between China and Japan have given us great concern, not\r\nalone for the maintenance of the spirit of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, but for\r\nthe maintenance of the treaties to which we are a party assuring the\r\nterritorial integrity of China. It is our purpose to assist in finding\r\nsolutions sustaining the full spirit of those treaties.\r\n\r\nI shall deal at greater length with our foreign relations in a later\r\nmessage.\r\n\r\nTHE DOMESTIC SITUATION\r\n\r\nMany undertakings have been organized and forwarded during the past year to\r\nmeet the new and changing emergencies which have constantly confronted us.\r\n\r\nBroadly the community has cooperated to meet the needs of honest distress,\r\nand to take such emergency measures as would sustain confidence in our\r\nfinancial system and would cushion the violence of liquidation in industry\r\nand commerce, thus giving time for orderly readjustment of costs,\r\ninventories, and credits without panic and widespread bankruptcy. These\r\nmeasures have served those purposes and will promote recovery.\r\n\r\nIn these measures we have striven to mobilize and stimulate private\r\ninitiative and local and community responsibility. There has been the least\r\npossible Government entry into the economic field, and that only in\r\ntemporary and emergency form. Our citizens and our local governments have\r\ngiven a magnificent display of unity and action, initiative and patriotism\r\nin solving a multitude of difficulties and in cooperating with the Federal\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nFor a proper understanding of my recommendations to the Congress it is\r\ndesirable very briefly to review such activities during the past year.\r\n\r\nThe emergencies of unemployment have been met by action in many directions.\r\nThe appropriations for the continued speeding up of the great Federal\r\nconstruction program have provided direct and indirect aid to employment\r\nupon a large scale. By organized unity of action, the States and\r\nmunicipalities have also maintained large programs of public improvement.\r\nMany industries have been prevailed upon to anticipate and intensify\r\nconstruction. Industrial concerns and other employers have been organized\r\nto spread available work amongst all their employees, instead of\r\ndischarging a portion of them. A large majority have maintained wages at as\r\nhigh levels as the safe conduct of their business would permit. This course\r\nhas saved us from industrial conflict and disorder which have characterized\r\nall previous depressions. Immigration has been curtailed by administrative\r\naction. Upon the basis of normal immigration the decrease amounts to about\r\n300,000 individuals who otherwise would have been added to our\r\nunemployment. The expansion of Federal employment agencies under\r\nappropriations by the Congress has proved most effective. Through the\r\nPresident's organization for unemployment relief, public and private\r\nagencies were successfully mobilized last winter to provide employment and\r\nother measures against distress. Similar organization gives assurance\r\nagainst suffering during the coming winter. Committees of leading citizens\r\nare now active at practically every point of unemployment. In the large\r\nmajority they have been assured the funds necessary which, together with\r\nlocal government aids, will meet the situation. A few exceptional\r\nlocalities will be further organized. The evidence of the Public Health\r\nService shows an actual decrease of sickness and infant and general\r\nmortality below normal years. No greater proof could be adduced that our\r\npeople have been protected from hunger and cold and that the sense of\r\nsocial responsibility in the Nation has responded to the need of the\r\nunfortunate.\r\n\r\nTo meet the emergencies in agriculture the loans authorized by Congress for\r\nrehabilitation in the drought areas have enabled farmers to produce\r\nabundant crops in those districts. The Red Cross undertook and\r\nmagnificently administered relief for over 2,500,000 drought sufferers last\r\nwinter. It has undertaken this year to administer relief to 100,000\r\nsufferers in the new drought area of certain Northwest States. The action\r\nof the Federal Farm Board in granting credits to farm cooperatives saved\r\nmany of them from bankruptcy and increased their purpose and strength. By\r\nenabling farm cooperatives to cushion the fall in prices of farm products\r\nin 1930 and 1931 the Board secured higher prices to the farmer than would\r\nhave been obtained otherwise, although the benefits of this action were\r\npartially defeated by continued world overproduction. Incident to this\r\naction the failure of a large number of farmers and of country banks was\r\naverted which could quite possibly have spread into a major disaster. The\r\nbanks in the South have cooperated with the Farm Board in creation of a\r\npool for the better marketing of accumulated cotton. Growers have been\r\nmaterially assisted by this action. Constant effort has been made to reduce\r\noverproduction in relief of agriculture and to promote the foreign buying\r\nof agricultural products by sustaining economic stability abroad.\r\n\r\nTo meet our domestic emergencies in credit and banking arising from the\r\nreaction to acute crisis abroad the National Credit Association was set up\r\nby the banks with resources of $500,000,000 to support sound banks against\r\nthe frightened withdrawals and hoarding. It is giving aid to reopen solvent\r\nbanks which have been closed. Federal officials have brought about many\r\nbeneficial unions of banks and have employed other means which have\r\nprevented many bank closings. As a result of these measures the hoarding\r\nwithdrawals which had risen to over $250,000,000 per week after the British\r\ncrisis have substantially ceased.\r\n\r\nFURTHER MEASURES\r\n\r\nThe major economic forces and weaknesses at home and abroad have now been\r\nexposed and can be appraised, and the time is ripe for forward action to\r\nexpedite our recovery.\r\n\r\nAlthough some of the causes of our depression are due to speculation,\r\ninflation of securities and real estate, unsound foreign investments, and\r\nmismanagement of financial institutions, yet our self-contained national\r\neconomy, with its matchless strength and resources, would have enabled us\r\nto recover long since but for the continued dislocations, shocks, and\r\nsetbacks from abroad.\r\n\r\nWhatever the causes may be, the vast liquidation and readjustments which\r\nhave taken place have left us with a large degree of credit paralysis,\r\nwhich together with the situation in our railways and the conditions\r\nabroad, are now the outstanding obstacles to recuperation. If we can put\r\nour financial resources to work and can ameliorate the financial situation\r\nin the railways, I am confident we can make a large measure of recovery\r\nindependent of the rest of the world. A strong America is the highest\r\ncontribution to world stability.\r\n\r\nOne phase of the credit situation is indicated in the banks. During the\r\npast year banks, representing 3 per cent of our total deposits have been\r\nclosed. A large part of these failures have been caused by withdrawals for\r\nhoarding, as distinguished from the failures early in the depression where\r\nweakness due to mismanagement was the larger cause of failure. Despite\r\ntheir closing, many of them will pay in full. Although such withdrawals\r\nhave practically ceased, yet $1,100,000,000 of currency was previously\r\nwithdrawn which has still to return to circulation. This represents a large\r\nreduction of the ability of our banks to extend credit which would\r\notherwise fertilize industry and agriculture. Furthermore, many of our\r\nbankers, in order to prepare themselves to meet possible withdrawals, have\r\nfelt compelled to call in loans, to refuse new credits, and to realize upon\r\nsecurities, which in turn has demoralized the markets. The paralysis has\r\nbeen further augmented by the steady increase in recent years of the\r\nproportion of bank assets invested in long-term securities, such as\r\nmortgages and bonds. These securities tend to lose their liquidity in\r\ndepression or temporarily to fall in value so that the ability of the banks\r\nto meet the shock of sudden withdrawal is greatly lessened and the\r\nrestriction of all kinds of credit is thereby increased. The continuing\r\ncredit paralysis has operated to accentuate the deflation and liquidation\r\nof commodities, real estate, and securities below any reasonable basis of\r\nvalues.\r\n\r\nAll of this tends to stifle business, especially the smaller units, and\r\nfinally expresses itself in further depression of prices and values, in\r\nrestriction on new enterprise, and in increased unemployment.\r\n\r\nThe situation largely arises from an unjustified lack of confidence. We\r\nhave enormous volumes of idle money in the banks and in hoarding. We do not\r\nrequire more money or working capital--we need to put what we have to\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental difficulties which have brought about financial strains in\r\nforeign countries do not exist in the United States. No external drain on\r\nour resources can threaten our position, because the balance of\r\ninternational payments is in our favor; we owe less to foreign countries\r\nthan they owe to us; our industries are efficiently organized; our currency\r\nand bank deposits are protected by the greatest gold reserve in history.\r\n\r\nOur first step toward recovery is to reestablish confidence and thus\r\nrestore the flow of credit which is the very basis of our economic life. We\r\nmust put some steel beams in the foundations of our credit structure. It is\r\nour duty to apply the full strength of our Government not only to the\r\nimmediate phases, but to provide security against shocks and the repetition\r\nof the weaknesses which have been proven.\r\n\r\nThe recommendations which I here lay before the Congress are designed to\r\nmeet these needs by strengthening financial, industrial, and agricultural\r\nlife through the medium of our existing institutions, and thus to avoid the\r\nentry of the Government into competition with private business.\r\n\r\nFEDERAL GOVERNMENT FINANCE\r\n\r\nThe first requirement of confidence and of economic recovery is financial\r\nstability of the United States Government. I shall deal with fiscal\r\nquestions at greater length in the Budget message. But I must at this time\r\ncall attention to the magnitude of the deficits which have developed and\r\nthe resulting necessity for determined and courageous policies. These\r\ndeficits arise in the main from the heavy decrease in tax receipts due to\r\nthe depression and to the increase in expenditure on construction in aid to\r\nunemployment, aids to agriculture, and upon services to veterans.\r\n\r\nDuring the fiscal year ending June 30 last we incurred a deficit of about\r\n$903,000,000, which included the statutory reduction of the debt and\r\nrepresented an increase of the national debt by $616,000,000. Of this,\r\nhowever, $153,000,000 is offset by increased cash balances.\r\n\r\nIn comparison with the fiscal year 1928 there is indicated a fall in\r\nFederal receipts for the present fiscal year amounting to $1,683,000,000,\r\nof which $1,034,000,000 is in individual and corporate income taxes alone.\r\nDuring this fiscal year there will be an increased expenditure, as compared\r\nto 1928, on veterans of $255,000,000, and an increased expenditure on\r\nconstruction work which may reach $520,000,000. Despite large economies in\r\nother directions, we have an indicated deficit, including the statutory\r\nretirement of the debt, of $2,123,000,000, and an indicated net debt\r\nincrease of about $1,711,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe Budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1 next, after allowing for\r\nsome increase of taxes under the present laws and after allowing for\r\ndrastic reduction in expenditures, still indicates a deficit of\r\n$1,417,000,000. After offsetting the statutory debt retirements this would\r\nindicate an increase in the national debt for the fiscal year 1933 of about\r\n$921,000,000.\r\n\r\nSeveral conclusions are inevitable. We must have insistent and determined\r\nreduction in Government expenses. We must face a temporary increase in\r\ntaxes. Such increase should not cover the whole of these deficits or it\r\nwill retard recovery. We must partially finance the deficit by borrowing.\r\nIt is my view that the amount of taxation should be fixed so as to balance\r\nthe Budget for 1933 except for the statutory debt retirement. Such\r\nGovernment receipts would assure the balance of the following year's budget\r\nincluding debt retirement. It is my further view that the additional\r\ntaxation should be imposed solely as an emergency measure terminating\r\ndefinitely two years from July 1 next. Such a basis will give confidence in\r\nthe determination of the Government to stabilize its finance and will\r\nassure taxpayers of its temporary character. Even with increased taxation,\r\nthe Government will reach the utmost safe limit of its borrowing capacity\r\nby the expenditures for which we are already obligated and the\r\nrecommendations here proposed. To go further than these limits in either\r\nexpenditures, taxes, or borrowing will destroy confidence, denude commerce\r\nand industry of its resources, jeopardize the financial system, and\r\nactually extend unemployment and demoralize agriculture rather than relieve\r\nit.\r\n\r\nFEDERAL LAND BANKS\r\n\r\nI recommend that the Congress authorize the subscription by the Treasury of\r\nfurther capital to the Federal land banks to be retired as provided in the\r\noriginal act, or when funds are available, and that repayments of such\r\ncapital be treated as a fund available for further subscriptions in the\r\nsame manner. It is urgent that the banks be supported so as to stabilize\r\nthe market values of their bonds and thus secure capital for the farmers at\r\nlow rates, that they may continue their services to agriculture and that\r\nthey may meet the present situation with consideration to the farmers.\r\n\r\nDEPOSITS IN CLOSED BANKS\r\n\r\nA method should be devised to make available quickly to depositors some\r\nportion of their deposits in closed banks as the assets of such banks may\r\nwarrant. Such provision would go far to relieve distress in a multitude of\r\nfamilies, would stabilize values in many communities, and would liberate\r\nworking capital to thousands of concerns. I recommend that measures be\r\nenacted promptly to accomplish these results and I suggest that the\r\nCongress should consider the development of such a plan through the Federal\r\nReserve Banks.\r\n\r\nHOME-LOAN DISCOUNT BANKS\r\n\r\nI recommend the establishment of a system of home-loan discount banks as\r\nthe necessary companion in our financial structure of the Federal Reserve\r\nBanks and our Federal Land Banks. Such action will relieve present\r\ndistressing pressures against home and farm property owners. It will\r\nrelieve pressures upon and give added strength to building and loan\r\nassociations, savings banks, and deposit banks, engaged in extending such\r\ncredits. Such action would further decentralize our credit structure. It\r\nwould revive residential construction and employment. It would enable such\r\nloaning institutions more effectually to promote home ownership. I\r\ndiscussed this plan at some length in a statement made public November 14,\r\nlast. This plan has been warmly indorsed by the recent National Conference\r\nupon Home Ownership and Housing, whose members were designated by the\r\ngovernors of the States and the groups interested.\r\n\r\nRECONSTRUCTION FINANCE CORPORATION\r\n\r\nIn order that the public may be absolutely assured and that the Government\r\nmay be in position to meet any public necessity, I recommend that an\r\nemergency Reconstruction Corporation of the nature of the former War\r\nFinance Corporation should be established. It may not be necessary to use\r\nsuch an instrumentality very extensively. The very existence of such a\r\nbulwark will strengthen confidence. The Treasury should be authorized to\r\nsubscribe a reasonable capital to it, and it should be given authority to\r\nissue its own debentures. It should be placed in liquidation at the end of\r\ntwo years. Its purpose is that by strengthening the weak spots to thus\r\nliberate the full strength of the Nation's resources. It should be in\r\nposition to facilitate exports by American agencies; make advances to\r\nagricultural credit agencies where necessary to protect and aid the\r\nagricultural industry; to make temporary advances upon proper securities to\r\nestablished industries, railways, and financial institutions which can not\r\notherwise secure credit, and where such advances will protect the credit\r\nstructure and stimulate employment. Its functions would not overlap those\r\nof the National Credit Corporation.\r\n\r\nFEDERAL RESERVE ELIGIBILITY\r\n\r\nOn October 6th I issued a statement that I should recommend to the Congress\r\nan extension during emergencies of the eligibility provisions in the\r\nFederal reserve act. This statement was approved by a representative\r\ngathering of the Members of both Houses of the Congress, including members\r\nof the appropriate committees. It was approved by the officials of the\r\nTreasury Department, and I understand such an extension has been approved\r\nby a majority of the governors of the Federal reserve banks. Nothing should\r\nbe done which would lower the safeguards of the system.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of the mortgage-discount banks herein referred to will\r\nalso contribute to further reserve strength in the banks without\r\ninflation.\r\n\r\nBANKING LAWS\r\n\r\nOur people have a right to a banking system in which their deposits shall\r\nbe safeguarded and the flow of credit less subject to storms. The need of a\r\nsounder system is plainly shown by the extent of bank failures. I recommend\r\nthe prompt improvement of the banking laws. Changed financial conditions\r\nand commercial practices must be met. The Congress should investigate the\r\nneed for separation between different kinds of banking; an enlargement of\r\nbranch banking under proper restrictions; and the methods by which enlarged\r\nmembership in the Federal reserve system may be brought about.\r\n\r\nPOSTAL SAVINGS BANKS\r\n\r\nThe Postal Savings deposits have increased from about $200,000,000 to about\r\n$550,000,000 during the past year. This experience has raised important\r\npractical questions in relation to deposits and investments which should\r\nreceive the attention of the Congress.\r\n\r\nRAILWAYS\r\n\r\nThe railways present one of our immediate and pressing problems. They are\r\nand must remain the backbone of our transportation system. Their prosperity\r\nis interrelated with the prosperity of all industries. Their fundamental\r\nservice in transportation, the volume of their employment, their buying\r\npower for supplies from other industries, the enormous investment in their\r\nsecurities, particularly their bonds, by insurance companies, savings\r\nbanks, benevolent and other trusts, all reflect their partnership in the\r\nwhole economic fabric. Through these institutions the railway bonds are in\r\na large sense the investment of every family. The well-maintained and\r\nsuccessful operation and the stability of railway finances are of primary\r\nimportance to economic recovery. They should have more effective\r\nopportunity to reduce operating costs by proper consolidation. As their\r\nrates must be regulated in public interest, so also approximate regulation\r\nshould be applied to competing services by some authority. The methods of\r\ntheir regulation should be revised. The Interstate Commerce Commission has\r\nmade important and far-reaching recommendations upon the whole subject,\r\nwhich I commend to the early consideration of the Congress.\r\n\r\nANTITRUST LAWS\r\n\r\nIn my message of a year ago I commented on the necessity of congressional\r\ninquiry into the economic action of the antitrust laws. There is wide\r\nconviction that some change should be made especially in the procedure\r\nunder these laws. I do not favor their repeal. Such action would open wide\r\nthe door to price fixing, monopoly, and destruction of healthy competition.\r\nParticular attention should be given to the industries rounded upon natural\r\nresources, especially where destructive competition produces great wastes\r\nof these resources and brings great hardships upon operators, employees,\r\nand the public. In recent years there has been continued demoralization in\r\nthe bituminous coal, oil, and lumber industries. I again commend the matter\r\nto the consideration of the Congress.\r\n\r\nUNEMPLOYMENT\r\n\r\nAs an aid to unemployment the Federal Government is engaged in the greatest\r\nprogram of public-building, harbor, flood-control, highway, waterway,\r\naviation, merchant and naval ship construction in all history. Our\r\nexpenditures on these works during this calendar year will reach about\r\n$780,000,000 compared with $260,000,000 in 1928. Through this increased\r\nconstruction, through the maintenance of a full complement of Federal\r\nemployees, and through services to veterans it is estimated that the\r\nFederal taxpayer is now directly contributing to the livelihood of\r\n10,000,000 of our citizens.\r\n\r\nWe must avoid burdens upon the Government which will create more\r\nunemployment in private industry than can be gained by further expansion of\r\nemployment by the Federal Government. We can now stimulate employment and\r\nagriculture more effectually and speedily through the voluntary measures in\r\nprogress, through the thawing out of credit, through the building up of\r\nstability abroad, through the home loan discount banks, through an\r\nemergency finance corporation and the rehabilitation of the railways and\r\nother such directions.\r\n\r\nI am opposed to any direct or indirect Government dole. The breakdown and\r\nincreased unemployment in Europe is due in part to such practices. Our\r\npeople are providing against distress from unemployment in true American\r\nfashion by a magnificent response to public appeal and by action of the\r\nlocal governments.\r\n\r\nGENERAL LEGISLATION\r\n\r\nThere are many other subjects requiring legislative action at this session\r\nof the Congress. I may list the following among them:\r\n\r\nVETERANS' SERVICES\r\n\r\nThe law enacted last March authorizing loans of 50 per cent upon\r\nadjusted-service certificates has, together with the loans made under\r\nprevious laws, resulted in payments of about $1,260,000,000. Appropriations\r\nhave been exhausted. The Administrator of Veterans' Affairs advises that a\r\nfurther appropriation of $200,000,000 is required at once to meet the\r\nobligations made necessary by existing legislation.\r\n\r\nThere will be demands for further veterans' legislation; there are\r\ninequalities in our system of veterans' relief; it is our national duty to\r\nmeet our obligations to those who have served the Nation. But our present\r\nexpenditure upon these services now exceeds $1,000,000,000 per annum. I am\r\nopposed to any extension of these expenditures until the country has\r\nrecovered from the present situation.\r\n\r\nELECTRICAL-POWER REGULATION\r\n\r\nI have recommended in previous messages the effective regulation of\r\ninterstate electrical power as the essential function of the reorganized\r\nFederal Power Commission. I renew the recommendation. It is urgently needed\r\nin public protection.\r\n\r\nMUSCLE SHOALS\r\n\r\nAt my suggestion, the Governors and Legislatures of Alabama and Tennessee\r\nselected three members each for service on a committee to which I appointed\r\na representative of the farm organizations and two representatives of the\r\nWar Department for the purpose of recommending a plan for the disposal of\r\nthese properties which would be in the interest of the people of those\r\nStates and the agricultural industry throughout the country. I shall\r\ntransmit the recommendations to the Congress.\r\n\r\nREORGANIZATION OF FEDERAL DEPARTMENTS\r\n\r\nI have referred in previous messages to the profound need of further\r\nreorganization and consolidation of Federal administrative functions to\r\neliminate overlap and waste, and to enable coordination and definition of\r\nGovernment policies now wholly impossible in scattered and conflicting\r\nagencies which deal with parts of the same major function. I shall lay\r\nbefore the Congress further recommendations upon this subject, particularly\r\nin relation to the Department of the Interior. There are two directions of\r\nsuch reorganization, however, which have an important bearing upon the\r\nemergency problems with which we are confronted.\r\n\r\nSHIPPING BOARD\r\n\r\nAt present the Shipping Board exercises large administrative functions\r\nindependent of the Executive. These administrative functions should be\r\ntransferred to the Department of Commerce, in keeping with that single\r\nresponsibility which has been the basis of our governmental structure since\r\nits foundation. There should be created in that department a position of\r\nAssistant Secretary for Merchant Marine, under whom this work and the\r\nseveral bureaus having to do with merchant marine may be grouped.\r\n\r\nThe Shipping Board should be made a regulatory body acting also in advisory\r\ncapacity on loans and policies, in keeping with its original conception.\r\nIts regulatory powers should be amended to include regulation of coastwise\r\nshipping so as to assure stability and better service. It is also worthy of\r\nconsideration that the regulation of rates and services upon the inland\r\nwaterways should be assigned to such a reorganized board.\r\n\r\nREORGANIZATION OF PUBLIC WORKS ADMINISTRATION\r\n\r\nI recommend that all building and construction activities of the Government\r\nnow carried on by many departments be consolidated into an independent\r\nestablishment under the President to be known as the \"Public Works\r\nAdministration\" directed by a Public Works Administrator. This agency\r\nshould undertake all construction work in service to the different\r\ndepartments of the Government (except naval and military work). The\r\nservices of the Corps of Army Engineers should be delegated in rotation for\r\nmilitary duty to this administration in continuation of their supervision\r\nof river and harbor work. Great economies, sounder policies, more effective\r\ncoordination to employment, and expedition in all construction work would\r\nresult from this consolidation.\r\n\r\nLAW ENFORCEMENT\r\n\r\nI shall present some recommendations in a special message looking to the\r\nstrengthening of criminal-law enforcement and improvement in judicial\r\nprocedure connected therewith.\r\n\r\nINLAND WATERWAY AND HARBOR IMPROVEMENT\r\n\r\nThese improvements are now proceeding upon an unprecedented scale. Some\r\nindication of the volume of work in progress is conveyed by the fact that\r\nduring the current year over 380,000,000 cubic yards of material have been\r\nmoved--an amount equal to the entire removal in the construction of the\r\nPanama Canal. The Mississippi waterway system, connecting Chicago, Kansas\r\nCity, Pittsburgh, and New Orleans, will be in full operation during 1933.\r\nSubstantial progress is being made upon the projects of the upper Missouri,\r\nupper Mississippi, etc.\r\n\r\nNegotiations are now in progress with Canada for the construction of the\r\nSt. Lawrence Waterway.\r\n\r\nTHE TARIFF\r\n\r\nWages and standards of living abroad have been materially lowered during\r\nthe past year. The temporary abandonment of the gold standard by certain\r\ncountries has also reduced their production costs compared to ours.\r\nFortunately any increases in the tariff which may be necessary to protect\r\nagriculture and industry from these lowered foreign costs, or decreases in\r\nitems which may prove to be excessive, may be undertaken at any time by the\r\nTariff Commission under authority which it possesses by virtue of the\r\ntariff act of 1930. The commission during the past year has reviewed the\r\nrates upon over 254 items subject to tariff. As a result of vigorous and\r\nindustrious action, it is up to date in the consideration of pending\r\nreferences and is prepared to give prompt attention to any further\r\napplications. This procedure presents an orderly method for correcting\r\ninequalities. I am opposed to any general congressional revision of the\r\ntariff. Such action would disturb industry, business, and agriculture. It\r\nwould prolong the depression.\r\n\r\nIMMIGRATION AND DEPORTATION\r\n\r\nI recommend that immigration restriction now in force under administrative\r\naction be placed upon a more definite basis by law. The deportation laws\r\nshould be strengthened. Aliens lawfully in the country should be protected\r\nby the issuance of a certificate of residence.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC HEALTH\r\n\r\nI again call attention to my previous recommendations upon this subject,\r\nparticularly in its relation to children. The moral results are of the\r\nutmost importance.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nIt is inevitable that in these times much of the legislation proposed to\r\nthe Congress and many of the recommendations of the Executive must be\r\ndesigned to meet emergencies. In reaching solutions we must not jeopardize\r\nthose principles which we have found to be the basis of the growth of the\r\nNation. The Federal Government must not encroach upon nor permit local\r\ncommunities to abandon that precious possession of local initiative and\r\nresponsibility. Again, just as the largest measure of responsibility in the\r\ngovernment of the Nation rests upon local self-government, so does the\r\nlargest measure of social responsibility in our country rest upon the\r\nindividual. If the individual surrenders his own initiative and\r\nresponsibilities, he is surrendering his own freedom and his own liberty.\r\nIt is the duty of the National Government to insist that both the local\r\ngovernments and the individual shall assume and bear these responsibilities\r\nas a fundamental of preserving the very basis of our freedom.\r\n\r\nMany vital changes and movements of vast proportions are taking place in\r\nthe economic world. The effect of these changes upon the future can not be\r\nseen clearly as yet. Of this, however, we are sure: Our system, based upon\r\nthe ideals of individual initiative and of equality of opportunity, is not\r\nan artificial thing. Rather it is the outgrowth of the experience of\r\nAmerica, and expresses the faith and spirit of our people. It has carried\r\nus in a century and a half to leadership of the economic world. If our\r\neconomic system does not match our highest expectations at all times, it\r\ndoes not require revolutionary action to bring it into accord with any\r\nnecessity that experience may prove. It has successfully adjusted itself to\r\nchanging conditions in the past. It will do so again. The mobility of our\r\ninstitutions, the richness of our resources, and the abilities of our\r\npeople enable us to meet them unafraid. It is a distressful time for many\r\nof our people, but they have shown qualities as high in fortitude, courage,\r\nand resourcefulness as ever in our history. With that spirit, I have faith\r\nthat out of it will come a sounder life, a truer standard of values, a\r\ngreater recognition of the results of honest effort, and a healthier\r\natmosphere in which to rear our children. Ours must be a country of such\r\nstability and security as can not fail to carry forward and enlarge among\r\nall the people that abundant life of material and spiritual opportunity\r\nwhich it has represented among all nations since its beginning.\r\n\r\nThe White House,\r\n\r\nDecember 8, 1931\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nHerbert Hoover\r\nDecember 6, 1932\r\n\r\nTo the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nIn accord with my constitutional duty, I transmit herewith to the Congress\r\ninformation upon the state of the Union together with recommendation of\r\nmeasures for its consideration.\r\n\r\nOur country is at peace. Our national defense has been maintained at a high\r\nstate of effectiveness. All of the executive departments of the Government\r\nhave been conducted during the year with a high devotion to public\r\ninterest. There has been a far larger degree of freedom from industrial\r\nconflict than hitherto known. Education and science have made further\r\nadvances. The public health is to-day at its highest known level. While we\r\nhave recently engaged in the aggressive contest of a national election, its\r\nvery tranquillity and the acceptance of its results furnish abundant proof\r\nof the strength of our institutions.\r\n\r\nIn the face of widespread hardship our people have demonstrated daily a\r\nmagnificent sense of humanity, of individual and community responsibility\r\nfor the welfare of the less fortunate. They have grown in their conceptions\r\nand organization for cooperative action for the common welfare.\r\n\r\nIn the provision against distress during this winter, the great private\r\nagencies of the country have been mobilized again; the generosity of our\r\npeople has again come into evidence to a degree in which all America may\r\ntake great pride. Likewise the local authorities and the States are engaged\r\neverywhere in supplemental measures of relief. The provisions made for\r\nloans from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, to States that have\r\nexhausted their own resources, guarantee that there should be no hunger or\r\nsuffering from cold in the country. The large majority of States are\r\nshowing a sturdy cooperation in the spirit of the Federal aid.\r\n\r\nThe Surgeon General, in charge of the Public Health Service, furnishes me\r\nwith the following information upon the state of public health:\r\n\r\nMORTALITY RATE PER 1,000 OF POPULATION ON AN ANNUAL BASIS FROM\r\nREPRESENTATIVE STATES - General - Infant\r\n\r\nFirst 9 months of-- - -\r\n\r\n1928 - 11.9 - 67.8\r\n\r\n1929 - 12.0 - 65.8\r\n\r\n1930 - 11.4 - 62.0\r\n\r\n1931 - 11.2 - 60.0\r\n\r\n1932 - 10.6 - 55.0\r\n\r\nThe sickness rates from data available show the same trends. These facts\r\nindicate the fine endeavor of the agencies which have been mobilized for\r\ncare of those in distress.\r\n\r\nECONOMIC SITUATION\r\n\r\nThe unparalleled world-wide economic depression has continued through the\r\nyear. Due to the European collapse, the situation developed during last\r\nfall and winter into a series of most acute crises. The unprecedented\r\nemergency measures enacted and policies adopted undoubtedly saved the\r\ncountry from economic disaster. After serving to defend the national\r\nsecurity, these measures began in July to show their weight and influence\r\ntoward improvement of conditions in many parts of the country. The\r\nfollowing tables of current business indicators show the general economic\r\nmovement during the past eleven months.\r\n\r\nMONTHLY BUSINESS INDICES WITH SEASONAL VARIATIONS ELIMINATED\r\n\r\nYear and Month - Industrial Production - Factory Employment - Freight-car\r\nloadings - Department Store sales, value - Exports, value - Imports, value\r\n- Building Contracts, all types - Industrial Electric power consumption\r\n\r\n1931 - - - - - - - -\r\n\r\nDecember - 74 - 69.4 - 69 - 81 - 46 - 48 - 38 - 89.1\r\n\r\n1932 - - - - - - - -\r\n\r\nJanuary - 72 - 68.1 - 64 - 78 - 39 - 42 - 31 - 93.9\r\n\r\nFebruary - 69 - 67.8 - 62 - 78 - 45 - 41 - 27 - 98.8\r\n\r\nMarch - 67 - 66.4 - 61 - 72 - 41 - 37 - 26 - 88.0\r\n\r\nApril - 63 - 64.3 - 59 - 80 - 38 - 36 - 27 - 82.2\r\n\r\nMay - 60 - 62.1 - 54 - 73 - 37 - 34 - 26 - 82.0\r\n\r\nJune - 59 - 60.0 - 52 - 71 - 34 - 36 - 27 - 78.1\r\n\r\nJuly - 58 - 58.3 - 51 - 67 - 32 - 27 - 27 - 79.2\r\n\r\nAugust - 60 - 58.8 - 51 - 66 - 31 - 29 - 30 - 73.5\r\n\r\nSeptember - 66 - 60.3 - 54 - 70 - 33 - 32 - 30 - 84.0\r\n\r\nOctober - 66 - 61.1 - 57 - 70 - 33 - 32 - 29 - 84.4\r\n\r\nThe measures and policies which have procured this turn toward recovery\r\nshould be continued until the depression is passed, and then the emergency\r\nagencies should be promptly liquidated. The expansion of credit facilities\r\nby the Federal Reserve System and the Reconstruction Finance Corporation\r\nhas been of incalculable value. The loans of the latter for reproductive\r\nworks, and to railways for the creation of employment; its support of the\r\ncredit structure through loans to banks, insurance companies, railways,\r\nbuilding and loan associations, and to agriculture has protected the\r\nsavings and insurance policies of millions of our citizens and has relieved\r\nmillions of borrowers from duress; they have enabled industry and business\r\nto function and expand. The assistance given to Farm Loan Banks, the\r\nestablishment of the Home Loan Banks and Agricultural Credit\r\nAssociations--all in their various ramifications have placed large sums of\r\nmoney at the disposal of the people in protection and aid. Beyond this, the\r\nextensive organization of the country in voluntary action has produced\r\nprofound results.\r\n\r\nThe following table indicates direct expenditures of the Federal Government\r\nin aid to unemployment, agriculture, and financial relief over the past\r\nfour years. The sums applied to financial relief multiply themselves many\r\nfold, being in considerable measure the initial capital supplied to the\r\nReconstruction Finance Corporation, Farm Loan Banks, etc., which will be\r\nrecovered to the Treasury.\r\n\r\n- Public works (1) - Agricultural relief and financial loans\r\n\r\nFiscal year ending June 30 - -\r\n\r\n1930 - $410,420,000 - $156,100,000\r\n\r\n1931 - 574,870,000 - 196,700,000\r\n\r\n1932 - 655,880,000 - 772,700,000\r\n\r\n1933 - 717,260,000 - 52,000,000 -",
