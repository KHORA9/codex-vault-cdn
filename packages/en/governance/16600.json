SIR JOHN GORDON SPRIGG         224\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe recent death of Sir Starr Jameson reminded the public of the South\r\nAfrican War, which was such an engrossing subject to the British public at\r\nthe close of the 'nineties and the first years of the present century. Yet\r\nthough it may seem quite out of date to reopen the question when so many\r\nmore important matters occupy attention, the relationship between South\r\nAfrica and England is no small matter. It has also had its influence on\r\nactual events, if only by proving to the world the talent which Great\r\nBritain has displayed in the administration of her vast Colonies and the\r\ntact with which British statesmen have contrived to convert their foes of\r\nthe day before into friends, sincere, devoted and true.\r\n\r\nNo other country in the world could have achieved such a success as did\r\nEngland in the complicated and singularly difficult task of making itself\r\npopular among nations whose independence it had destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe secret of this wonderful performance lies principally in the care\r\nwhich England has exercised to secure the welfare of the annexed\r\npopulation, and to do nothing likely to keep them in remembrance of the\r\nsubordinate position into which they had been reduced. England never\r\ncrushes those whom it subdues. Its inbred talent for colonisation has\r\ninvariably led it along the right path in regard to its colonial\r\ndevelopment. Even in cases where Britain made the weight of its rule\r\nrather heavy for the people whom it had conquered, there still developed\r\namong them a desire to remain federated to the British Empire, and also a\r\nconviction that union, though it might be unpleasant to their personal\r\nfeelings and sympathies, was, after all, the best thing which could have\r\nhappened to them in regard to their material interests.\r\n\r\nProsperity has invariably attended British rule wherever it has found\r\nscope to develop itself, and at the present hour British patriotism is far\r\nmore demonstrative in India, Australia or South Africa than it is in\r\nEngland itself. The sentiments thus strongly expressed impart a certain\r\nzealotism to their feelings, which constitutes a strong link with the\r\nMother Country. In any hour of national danger or calamity this trait\r\nprovides her with the enthusiastic help of her children from across the\r\nseas.\r\n\r\nThe Englishman, generally quiet at home and even subdued in the presence\r\nof strangers, is exuberant in the Colonies; he likes to shout his\r\npatriotism upon every possible occasion, even when it would be better to\r\nrefrain. It is an aggressive patriotism which sometimes is quite uncouth\r\nin its manifestations, but it is real patriotism, disinterested and devoid\r\nof any mercenary or personal motives.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to know what England is if one has not had the\r\nopportunity of visiting her Dominions oversea. It is just as impossible to\r\njudge of Englishmen when one has only seen them at home amid the comforts\r\nof the easy and pleasant existence which one enjoys in Merrie England, and\r\nonly there. It is not the country Squires, whose homes are such a definite\r\nfeature of English life; nor the aristocratic members of the Peerage, with\r\ntheir influence and their wealth; nor even the political men who sit in\r\nSt. Stephen's, who have spread abroad the fame and might and power of\r\nEngland. But it is these modest pioneers of \"nations yet to be\" who, in\r\nthe wilds and deserts of South Africa, Australia and Asia, have\r\ndemonstrated the realities of English civilisation and the English spirit\r\nof freedom.\r\n\r\nIn the hour of danger we have seen all these members of the great Mother\r\nCountry rush to its help. The spectacle has been an inspiring one, and in\r\nthe case of South Africa especially it has been unique, inasmuch as it has\r\nbeen predicted far and wide that the memory of the Boer War would never\r\ndie out, and that loyalty to Great Britain would never be found in the\r\nvast African veldt. Facts have belied this rash assertion, and the world\r\nhas seldom witnessed a more impressive vindication of the triumph of true\r\nImperialism than that presented by Generals Botha and Smuts. As the leader\r\nof a whole nation, General Botha defended its independence against\r\naggression, yet became the faithful, devoted servant and the true adherent\r\nof the people whom he had fought a few years before, putting at their\r\ndisposal the weight of his powerful personality and the strength of his\r\ninfluence over his partisans and countrymen.\r\n                                                     CATHERINE RADZIWILL.\r\n    _December, 1917._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCECIL RHODES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nCECIL RHODES AND SIR ALFRED MILNER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe conquest of South Africa is one of the most curious episodes in\r\nEnglish history. Begun through purely mercenary motives, it yet acquired a\r\ncharacter of grandeur which, as time went on, divested it of all sordid\r\nand unworthy suspicions. South Africa has certainly been the land of\r\nadventurers, and many of them found there either fame or disgrace,\r\nunheard-of riches or the most abject poverty, power or humiliation. At the\r\nsame time the Colony has had amongst its rulers statesmen of unblemished\r\nreputation and high honour, administrators of rare integrity, and men who\r\nsaw beyond the fleeting interests of the hour into the far more important\r\nvista of the future.\r\n\r\nWhen President Kruger was at its head the Transvaal Republic would have\r\ncrumbled under the intrigues of some of its own citizens. The lust for\r\nriches which followed upon the discovery of the goldfields had, too, a\r\ndrastic effect. The Transvaal was bound to fall into the hands of someone,\r\nand to be that Someone fell to the lot of England. This was a kindly throw\r\nof Fate, because England alone could administer all the wealth of the\r\nregion without its becoming a danger, not only to the community at large,\r\nbut also to the Transvaalers.\r\n\r\nThat this is so can be proved by the eloquence of facts rather than by\r\nwords. It is sufficient to look upon what South Africa was twenty-five\r\nyears ago, and upon what it has become since under the protection of\r\nBritish rule, to be convinced of the truth of my assertion. From a land of\r\nperennial unrest and perpetual strife it has been transformed into a\r\nprosperous and quiet colony, absorbed only in the thought of its economic\r\nand commercial progress. Its population, which twenty years ago was\r\nwasting its time and energy in useless wrangles, stands to-day united to\r\nthe Mother Country and absorbed by the sole thought of how best to prove\r\nits devotion.\r\n\r\nThe Boer War has still some curious issues of which no notice has been\r\ntaken by the public at large. One of the principal, perhaps indeed the\r\nmost important of these, is that, though brought about by material\r\nambitions of certain people, it ended by being fought against these very\r\nsame people, and that its conclusion eliminated them from public life\r\ninstead of adding to their influence and their power. The result is\r\ncertainly a strange and an interesting one, but it is easily explained if\r\none takes into account the fact that once England as a nation--and not as\r\n_the_ nation to which belonged the handful of adventurers through whose\r\nintrigues the war was brought about--entered into the possession of the\r\nTransvaal and organised the long-talked-of Union of South Africa, the\r\ncountry started a normal existence free from the unhealthy symptoms which\r\nhad hindered its progress. It became a useful member of the vast British\r\nEmpire, as well as a prosperous country enjoying a good government, and\r\nlaunched itself upon a career it could never have entered upon but for the\r\nwar. Destructive as it was, the Boer campaign was not a war of\r\nannihilation. On the contrary, without it it would have been impossible\r\nfor the vast South African territories to become federated into a Union of\r\nits own and at the same time to take her place as a member of another\r\nEmpire from which it derived its prosperity and its welfare. The grandeur\r\nof England and the soundness of its leaders has never come out in a more\r\nstriking manner than in this conquest of South Africa--a blood-stained\r\nconquest which has become a love match.\r\n\r\nDuring the concluding years of last century the possibility of union was\r\nseldom taken into consideration; few, indeed, were clever enough and wise\r\nenough to find out that it was bound to take place as a natural\r\nconsequence of the South African War. The war cleared the air all over\r\nSouth Africa. It crushed and destroyed all the suspicious, unhealthy\r\nelements that had gathered around the gold mines of the Transvaal and the\r\ndiamond fields of Cape Colony. It dispersed the coterie of adventurers who\r\nhad hastened there with the intention of becoming rapidly rich at the\r\nexpense of the inhabitants of the country. A few men had succeeded in\r\nbuilding for themselves fortunes beyond the dreams of avarice, whilst the\r\nmajority contrived to live more or less well at the expense of those naïve\r\nenough to trust to them in financial matters until the day when the war\r\narrived to put an end to their plunderings.\r\n\r\nThe struggle into which President Kruger was compelled to rush was\r\nexpected by some of the powerful intriguers in South Africa to result in\r\nincreasing the influence of certain of the millionaires, who up to the\r\ntime when the war broke out had ruled the Transvaal and indirectly the\r\nCape Colony by the strength and importance of their riches. Instead, it\r\nweakened and then destroyed their power. Without the war South Africa\r\nwould have grown more wicked, and matters there were bound soon to come to\r\na crisis of some sort. The crux of the situation was whether this crisis\r\nwas going to be brought about by a few unscrupulous people for their own\r\nbenefit, or was to arise in consequence of the clever and far-seeing\r\npolicy of wise politicians.\r\n\r\nHappily for England, and I shall even say happily for the world at large,\r\nsuch a politician was found in the person of the then Sir Alfred Milner,\r\nwho worked unselfishly toward the grand aim his far-sighted Imperialism\r\nsaw in the distance.\r\n\r\nHistory will give Viscount Milner--as he is to-day--the place which is due\r\nto him. His is indeed a great figure; he was courageous enough, sincere\r\nenough, and brave enough to give an account of the difficulties of the\r\ntask he had accepted. His experience of Colonial politics was principally\r\nfounded on what he had seen and studied when in Egypt and in India, which\r\nwas a questionable equipment in the entirely new areas he was called upon\r\nto administer when he landed in Table Bay. Used to Eastern shrewdness and\r\nEastern duplicity, he had not had opportunity to fight against the\r\nunscrupulousness of men who were neither born nor brought up in the\r\ncountry, but who had grown to consider it as their own, and exploited its\r\nresources not only to the utmost, but also to the detriment of the\r\nprinciples of common honesty.\r\n\r\nThe reader must not take my words as signifying a sweeping condemnation of\r\nthe European population of South Africa. On the contrary, there existed in\r\nthat distant part of the world many men of great integrity, high\r\nprinciples and unsullied honour who would never, under any condition\r\nwhatsoever, have lent themselves to mean or dishonest action; men who held\r\nup high their national flag, and who gave the natives a splendid example\r\nof all that an Englishman could do or perform when called upon to maintain\r\nthe reputation of his Mother Country abroad.\r\n\r\nSome of the early English settlers have left great remembrance of their\r\nuseful activity in the matter of the colonisation of the new continent to\r\nwhich they had emigrated, and their descendants, of whom I am happy to say\r\nthere are a great number, have not shown themselves in any way unworthy of\r\ntheir forbears. South Africa has its statesmen and politicians who, having\r\nbeen born there, understand perfectly well its necessities and its wants.\r\nUnfortunately, for a time their voices were crushed by the new-comers who\r\nhad invaded the country, and who considered themselves better able than\r\nanyone else to administer its affairs. They brought along with them fresh,\r\nstrange ambitions, unscrupulousness, determination to obtain power for the\r\nfurtherance of their personal aims, and a greed which the circumstances in\r\nwhich they found themselves placed was bound to develop into something\r\neven worse than a vice, because it made light of human life as well as of\r\nhuman property.\r\n\r\nIn any judgment on South Africa one must never forget that, after all,\r\nbefore the war did the work of a scavenger it was nothing else but a vast\r\nmining camp, with all its terrifying moods, its abject defects, and its\r\nindifference with regard to morals and to means. The first men who began\r\nto exploit the riches of that vast territory contrived in a relatively\r\neasy way to build up their fortunes upon a solid basis, but many of their\r\nfollowers, eager to walk in their steps, found difficulties upon which\r\nthey had not reckoned or even thought about. In order to put them aside\r\nthey used whatever means lay in their power, without hesitation as to\r\nwhether these answered to the principles of honesty and\r\nstraightforwardness. Their ruthless conduct was so far advantageous to\r\ntheir future schemes that it inspired disgust among those whose ancestors\r\nhad sought a prosperity founded on hard work and conscientious toil. These\r\ngood folk retired from the field, leaving it free to the adventurers who\r\nwere to give such a bad name to England and who boasted loudly that they\r\nhad been given full powers to do what they liked in the way of conquering\r\na continent which, but for them, would have been only too glad to place\r\nitself under English protection and English rule. To these people, and to\r\nthese alone, were due all the antagonisms which at last brought about the\r\nBoer War.\r\n\r\nIt was with these people that Sir Alfred Milner found himself out of\r\nharmony; from the first moment that he had set his foot on African soil\r\nthey tried to put difficulties in his way, after they had convinced\r\nthemselves that he would never consent to lend himself to their schemes.\r\n\r\nLord Milner has never belonged to the class of men who allow themselves to\r\nbe influenced either by wealth or by the social position of anyone. He is\r\nperhaps one of the best judges of humanity it has been my fortune to meet,\r\nand though by no means an unkind judge, yet a very fair one. Intrigue is\r\nrepulsive to him, and unless I am very much mistaken I venture to affirm\r\nthat, in the 'nineties, because of the intrigues in which they indulged,\r\nhe grew to loathe some of the men with whom he was thrown into contact.\r\nYet he could not help seeing that these reckless speculators controlled\r\npublic opinion in South Africa, and his political instinct compelled him\r\nto avail himself of their help, as without them he would not have been\r\nable to arrive at a proper understanding of the entanglements and\r\ncomplications of South African politics.\r\n\r\nPrevious to Sir Alfred's appointment as Governor of the Cape of Good Hope\r\nthe office had been filled by men who, though of undoubted integrity and\r\nhigh standing, were yet unable to gauge the volume of intrigue with which\r\nthey had to cope from those who had already established an iron--or,\r\nrather, golden--rule in South Africa.\r\n\r\nCoteries of men whose sole aim was the amassing of quick fortunes were\r\nvirtual rulers of Cape Colony, with more power than the Government to whom\r\nthey simulated submission. All sorts of weird stories were in circulation.\r\nOne popular belief was that the mutiny of the Dutch in Cape Colony just\r\nbefore the Boer War was at bottom due to the influence of money. This was\r\nfollowed by a feeling that, but for the aggressive operations of the\r\noutpost agents of certain commercial magnates, it would have been possible\r\nfor England to realise the Union of South Africa by peaceful means instead\r\nof the bloody arbitrament of war.\r\n\r\nIn the minds of many Dutchmen--and Dutchmen who were sincerely patriotic\r\nTransvaalers--the conviction was strong that the natural capabilities of\r\nBoers did not lie in the direction of developing, as they could be, the\r\namazing wealth-producing resources of the Transvaal and of the Orange Free\r\nState. By British help alone, such men believed, could their country hope\r\nto thrive as it ought.\r\n\r\nHere, then, was the nucleus around which the peaceful union of Boer and\r\nEnglish peoples in South Africa could be achieved without bloodshed.\r\nIndeed, had Queen Victoria been represented at the Cape by Sir Alfred\r\nMilner ten years before he was appointed Governor there, many things which\r\nhad a disastrous influence on the Dutch elements in South Africa would not\r\nhave occurred. The Jameson Raid would certainly not have been planned and\r\nattempted. To this incident can be ascribed much of the strife and\r\nunpleasantness which followed, by which was lost to the British Government\r\nthe chance, then fast ripening, of bringing about without difficulty a\r\nreconciliation of Dutch and English all over South Africa. This\r\nreconciliation would have been achieved through Cecil Rhodes, and would\r\nhave been a fitting crown to a great career.\r\n\r\nAt one time the most popular man from the Zambesi to Table Mountain, the\r\nname of Cecil Rhodes was surrounded by that magic of personal power\r\nwithout which it is hardly possible for any conqueror to obtain the\r\nmaterial or moral successes that give him a place in history; that win for\r\nhim the love, the respect, and sometimes the hatred, of his\r\ncontemporaries. Sir Alfred Milner would have known how to make the work of\r\nCecil Rhodes of permanent value to the British Empire. It was a thousand\r\npities that when Sir Alfred Milner took office in South Africa the\r\ninfluence of Cecil Rhodes, at one time politically dominant, had so\r\nmaterially shrunk as a definitive political factor.\r\n\r\nSir Alfred Milner found himself in the presence of a position already\r\ncompromised beyond redemption, and obliged to fight against evils which\r\nought never to have been allowed to develop. Even at that time, however,\r\nit would have been possible for Sir Alfred Milner to find a way of\r\ndisposing of the various difficulties connected with English rule in South\r\nAfrica had he been properly seconded by Mr. Rhodes. Unfortunately for both\r\nof them, their antagonism to each other, in their conception of what ought\r\nor ought not to be done in political matters, was further aggravated by\r\nintrigues which tended to keep Rhodes apart from the Queen's High\r\nCommissioner in South Africa.\r\n\r\nIt would not at all have suited certain people had Sir Alfred contrived to\r\nacquire a definite influence over Mr. Rhodes, and assuredly this would\r\nhave happened had the two men have been allowed unhindered to appreciate\r\nthe mental standard of each other. Mr. Rhodes was at heart a sincere\r\npatriot, and it was sufficient to make an appeal to his feelings of\r\nattachment to his Mother Country to cause him to look at things from that\r\npoint of view. Had there existed any real intimacy between Groote Schuur\r\nand Government House at Cape Town, the whole course of South African\r\npolitics might have been very different.\r\n\r\nSir Alfred Milner arrived in Cape Town with a singularly free and unbiased\r\nmind, determined not to allow other people's opinions to influence his\r\nown, and also to use all the means at his disposal to uphold the authority\r\nof the Queen without entering into conflict with anyone. He had heard a\r\ndeal about the enmity of English and Dutch, but though he perfectly well\r\nrealised its cause he had made up his mind to examine the situation for\r\nhimself. He was not one of those who thought that the raid alone was\r\nresponsible; he knew very well that this lamentable affair had only fanned\r\ninto an open blaze years-long smoulderings of discontent. The Raid had\r\nbeen a consequence, not an isolated spontaneous act. Little by little over\r\na long span of years the ambitious and sordid overridings of various\r\nrestless, and too often reckless, adventurers had come to be considered as\r\nrepresentative of English rule, English opinions and, what was still more\r\nunfortunate, England's personality as an Empire and as a nation.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the matter, the Dutch--who were inconceivably\r\nignorant--thought their little domain the pivot of the world. Blind to\r\nrealities, they had no idea of the legitimate relative comparison between\r\nthe Transvaal and the British Empire, and so grew arrogantly oppressive in\r\ntheir attitude towards British settlers and the powers at Cape Town.\r\n\r\nAll this naturally tinctured native feeling. Suspicion was fostered among\r\nthe tribes, guns and ammunition percolated through Boer channels, the\r\nblacks viewed with disdain the friendly advances made by the British, and\r\nthe atmosphere was thick with mutual distrust. The knowledge that this was\r\nthe situation could not but impress painfully a delicate and proud mind,\r\nand surely Lord Milner can be forgiven for the illusion which he at one\r\ntime undoubtedly cherished that he would be able to dispel this false\r\nnotion about his Mother Country that pervaded South Africa.\r\n\r\nThe Governor had not the least animosity against the Dutch, and at first\r\nthe Boers had no feeling that Sir Alfred was prejudiced against them. Such\r\na thought was drilled into their minds by subtle and cunning people who,\r\nfor their own avaricious ends, desired to estrange the High Commissioner\r\nfrom the Afrikanders. Sir Alfred was represented as a tyrannical,\r\nunscrupulous man, whose one aim in life was the destruction of every\r\nvestige of Dutch independence, Dutch self-government and Dutch influence\r\nin Africa. Those who thus maligned him applied themselves to make him\r\nunpopular and to render his task so very uncongenial and unpleasant for\r\nhim that he would at last give it up of his own accord, or else become the\r\nobject of such violent hatreds that the Home Government would feel\r\ncompelled to recall him. Thus they would be rid of the presence of a\r\npersonage possessed of a sufficient energy to oppose them, and they would\r\nno longer need to fear his observant eyes. Sir Alfred Milner saw himself\r\nsurrounded by all sorts of difficulties, and every attempt he made to\r\nbring forward his own plans for the settlement of the South African\r\nquestion crumbled to the ground almost before he could begin to work at\r\nit. Small wonder, therefore, if he felt discouraged and began to form a\r\nfalse opinion concerning the persons or the facts with whom he had to\r\ndeal. Those who might have helped him were constrained, without it being\r\nhis fault. Mr. Rhodes became persuaded that the new Governor of Cape\r\nColony had arrived there with preconceived notions in regard to himself.\r\nHe was led to believe that Milner's firm determination was to crush him;\r\nthat, moreover, he was jealous of him and of the work he had done in South\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\nIncredible as it appears, Rhodes believed this absurd fiction, and learned\r\nto look upon Sir Alfred Milner as a natural enemy, desirous of thwarting\r\nhim at every step. The Bloemfontein Conference, at which the brilliant\r\nqualities and the conciliating spirit of the new Governor of Cape Colony\r\nwere first made clearly manifest, was represented to Rhodes as a desire to\r\npresent him before the eyes of the Dutch as a negligible quantity in South\r\nAfrica. Rhodes was strangely susceptible and far too mindful of the\r\nopinions of people of absolutely no importance. He fell into the snare,\r\nand though he was careful to hide from the public his real feelings in\r\nregard to Sir Alfred Milner, yet it was impossible for anyone who knew him\r\nwell not to perceive at once that he had made up his mind not to help the\r\nHigh Commissioner. There is such a thing as damning praise, and Rhodes\r\npoured a good deal of it on the head of Sir Alfred.\r\n\r\nFortunately, Sir Alfred was sufficiently conscious of the rectitude of his\r\nintentions and far too superior to feelings of petty spite. He never\r\nallowed himself to be troubled by these unpleasantnesses, but went on his\r\nway without giving his enemies the pleasure of noticing the measure of\r\nsuccess which, unhappily, attended their campaign. He remained inflexible\r\nin his conduct, and, disdaining any justification, went on doing what he\r\nthought was right, and which was right, as events proved subsequently.\r\nAlthough Milner had at last to give up, yet it is very largely due to him\r\nthat the South African Union was ultimately constituted, and that the\r\nmuch-talked-of reconciliation of the Dutch and English in Cape Colony and\r\nin the Transvaal became an accomplished fact. Had Sir Alfred been listened\r\nto from the very beginning it might have taken place sooner, and perhaps\r\nthe Boer War altogether avoided.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious thing that England's colonising powers, which are so\r\nremarkable, took such a long time to work their way in South Africa. At\r\nleast it would have been a curious thing if one did not remember that\r\namong the first white men who arrived there Englishmen were much in the\r\nminority. And of those Englishmen who were attracted by the enormous\r\nmineral wealth which the country contained, a good proportion were not of\r\nthe best class of English colonists. Many a one who landed in Table Bay\r\nwas an adventurer, drawn thither by the wish to make or retrieve his\r\nfortune. Few came, as did Rhodes, in search of health, and few, again,\r\nwere drawn thither by the pure love of adventure. In Australia, or in New\r\nZealand or other colonies, people arrived with the determination to begin\r\na new life and to create for themselves new ties, new occupations, new\r\nduties, so as to leave to their children after them the result of their\r\nlabours. In South Africa it was seldom that emigrants were animated by the\r\ndesire to make their home in the solitudes of the vast and unexplored\r\nveldt. Those who got rich there, though they may have built for themselves\r\nsplendid houses while they dwelt in the land, never looked upon South\r\nAfrica as home, but aspired to spend their quickly gained millions in\r\nLondon and to forget all about Table Mountain or the shafts and factories\r\nof Johannesburg and Kimberley.\r\n\r\nTo such men as these England was a pretext but never a symbol. Their\r\nstrange conception of patriotism jarred the most unpleasantly on the\r\nstraightforward nature of Sir Alfred Milner, who had very quickly\r\ndiscerned the egotism that lay concealed beneath its cloak. He understood\r\nwhat patriotism meant, what love for one's own country signified. He had\r\narrived in South Africa determined to spare neither his person nor his\r\nstrength in her service, and the man who was repeatedly accused both by\r\nthe Dutch and by the English party in the Colony of labouring under a\r\nmisconception of its real political situation was the one who had from the\r\nvery first appreciated it as it deserved, and had recognised its damning\r\nas well as its redeeming points.\r\n\r\nSir Alfred meant South Africa to become a member of the British Empire, to\r\nparticipate in its greatness, and to enjoy the benefits of its protection.\r\nHe had absolutely no idea of exasperating the feelings of the Dutch part\r\nof its population. He had the best intentions in regard to President\r\nKruger himself, and there was one moment, just at the time of the\r\nBloemfontein Conference, when a _modus vivendi_ between President Kruger\r\nand the Court of St. James's might have been established, notwithstanding\r\nthe difficult question of the Uitlanders. It was frustrated by none other\r\nthan these very Uitlanders, who, fondly believing that a war with England\r\nwould establish them as absolute masters in the Gold Fields, brought it\r\nabout, little realising that thereby was to be accomplished the one thing\r\nwhich they dreaded--the firm, just and far-seeing rule of England over all\r\nSouth Africa.\r\n\r\nIn a certain sense the Boer War was fought just as much against financiers\r\nas against President Kruger. It put an end to the arrogance of both.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE FOUNDATIONS OF FORTUNE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to speak of South Africa without awarding to Cecil Rhodes\r\nthe tribute which unquestionably is due to his strong personality. Without\r\nhim it is possible that the vast territory which became so thoroughly\r\nassociated with his name and with his life would still be without\r\npolitical importance. Without him it is probable that both the Diamond\r\nFields to which Kimberley owes its prosperity and the Gold Fields which\r\nhave won for the Transvaal its renown would never have risen above the\r\nimportance of those of Brazil or California or Klondyke.\r\n\r\nIt was Rhodes who first conceived the thought of turning all these riches\r\ninto a political instrument and of using it to the advantage of his\r\ncountry--the England to which he remained so profoundly attached amid all\r\nthe vicissitudes of his life, and to whose possessions he was so eager to\r\nadd.\r\n\r\nCecil Rhodes was ambitious in a grand, strange manner which made a\r\ncomplete abstraction of his own personality under certain conditions, but\r\nwhich in other circumstances made him violent, brutal in manner, thereby\r\nprocuring enemies without number and detractors without end. His nature\r\nwas something akin to that of the Roman Emperors in its insensate desire\r\nto exercise unchallenged an unlimited power. Impatient of restraint, no\r\nmatter in what shape it presented itself, he brooked no resistance to his\r\nschemes; his rage against contradiction, and his opposition to any\r\nindependence of thought or action on the part of those who were around\r\nhim, brought about a result of which he would have been the first to\r\ncomplain, had he suspected it--that of allowing him to execute all his\r\nfancies and of giving way to all his resentments. Herein lies the reason\r\nwhy so many of his schemes fell through. This unfortunate trait also\r\nthrust him very often into the hands of those who were clever enough to\r\nexploit it, and who, more often than proved good to Rhodes' renown,\r\nsuggested to him their own schemes and encouraged him to appropriate them\r\nas his own. He had a very quick way of catching hold of any suggestions\r\nthat tallied with his sympathies or echoed any of his secret thoughts or\r\naspirations.\r\n\r\nYet withal Rhodes was a great soul, and had he only been left to himself,\r\nor made longer sojourns in England, had he understood English political\r\nlife more clearly, had he had to grapple with the difficulties which\r\nconfront public existence in his Mother Country, he would most certainly\r\nhave done far greater things. He found matters far too easy for him at\r\nfirst, and the obstacles which he encountered very often proved either of\r\na trivial or else of a removable nature--by fair means or methods less\r\ncommendable. A mining camp is not a school of morality, and just as\r\ndiamonds lose of their value in the estimation of those who continually\r\nhandle them, as is the case in Kimberley, so integrity and honour come to\r\nbe looked upon from a peculiar point of view according to the code of the\r\nmajority.\r\n\r\nThen again, it must not be forgotten that the first opponents of Cecil\r\nRhodes were black men, of whom the European always has the conception that\r\nthey are not his equals. It is likely that if, instead of Lobengula, he\r\nhad found before him a European chief or monarch, Rhodes would have acted\r\ndifferently than history credits him to have done toward the dusky\r\nsovereign. It is impossible to judge of facts of which one has had no\r\noccasion to watch the developments, or which have taken place in lands\r\nwhere one has never been. Neither Fernando Cortez in Mexico nor Pizzaro\r\nGonzalo in Peru proved themselves merciful toward the populations whose\r\nterritory they conquered. The tragedy which sealed the fate of\r\nMatabeleland was neither a darker nor a more terrible one than those of\r\nwhich history speaks when relating to us the circumstances attending the\r\ndiscovery of America. Such events must be judged objectively and forgiven\r\naccordingly. When forming an opinion on the doings and achievements of\r\nCecil Rhodes one must make allowance for all the temptations which were\r\nthrown in his way and remember that he was a man who, if ambitious, was\r\nnot so in a personal sense, but in a large, lofty manner, and who, whilst\r\nappropriating to himself the good things which he thought he could grasp,\r\nwas also eager to make others share the profit of his success.\r\n\r\nCecil Rhodes, in all save name, was monarch over a continent almost as\r\nvast as his own fancy and imagination. He was always dreaming, always lost\r\nin thoughts which were wandering far beyond his actual surroundings,\r\ncarrying him into regions where the common spirit of mankind seldom\r\ntravelled. He was born for far better things than those which he\r\nultimately attained, but he did not belong to the century in which he\r\nlived; his ruthless passions of anger and arrogance were more fitted for\r\nan earlier and cruder era. Had he possessed any disinterested friends\r\ncapable of rousing the better qualities that slumbered beneath his\r\napparent cynicism and unscrupulousness, most undoubtedly he would have\r\nbecome the most remarkable individual in his generation. Unfortunately, he\r\nfound himself surrounded by creatures absolutely inferior to himself,\r\nwhose deficiencies he was the first to notice, whom he despised either for\r\ntheir insignificance or for their mental and moral failings, but to whose\r\ninfluence he nevertheless succumbed.\r\n\r\nWhen Cecil Rhodes arrived at Kimberley he was a mere youth. He had come to\r\nSouth Africa in quest of health and because he had a brother already\r\nsettled there, Herbert Rhodes, who was later on to meet with a terrible\r\nfate. Cecil, if one is to believe what one hears from those who knew him\r\nat the time, was a shy youth, of a retiring disposition, whom no one could\r\never have suspected would develop into the hardy, strong man he became in\r\ntime. He was constantly sick, and more than once was on the point of\r\nfalling a victim of the dreaded fever which prevails all over South Africa\r\nand then was far more virulent in its nature than it is to-day. Kimberley\r\nat that time was still a vast solitude, with here and there a few\r\nscattered huts of corrugated iron occupied by the handful of colonists.\r\nWater was rare: it is related, indeed, that the only way to get a wash was\r\nto use soda water.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of Rhodes' fortune, if we are to believe what we are told,\r\nwas an ice machine which he started in partnership with another settler.\r\nThe produce they sold to their companions at an exorbitant price, but not\r\nfor long; whereafter the enterprising young man proceeded to buy some\r\nplots of ground, of whose prolificacy in diamonds he had good reason to be\r\naware. It must be here remarked that Rhodes was never a poor man; he could\r\nindulge in experiments as to his manner of investing his capital. And he\r\nwas not slow to take advantage of this circumstance. Kimberley was a wild\r\nplace at that time, and its distance from the civilised world, as well as\r\nthe fact that nothing was controlled by public opinion, helped some to\r\namass vast fortunes and put the weaker into the absolute power of the most\r\nunscrupulous. It is to the honour of Rhodes that, however he might have\r\nbeen tempted, he never listened to the advice which was given to him to do\r\nwhat the others did, and to despoil the men whose property he might have\r\ndesired to acquire. He never gave way to the excesses of his daily\r\ncompanions, nor accepted their methods of enriching themselves at top\r\nspeed so as soon to be able to return home with their gains.\r\n\r\nFrom the first moment that he set foot on African soil Rhodes succumbed to\r\nthe strange charm the country offers for thinkers and dreamers. His\r\nnaturally languid temperament found a source of untold satisfaction in\r\nwatching the Southern Cross rise over the vast veldt where scarcely man's\r\nfoot had trod, where the immensity of its space was equalled by its\r\nsublime, quiet grandeur. He liked to spend the night in the open air,\r\ngazing at the innumerable stars and listening to the voice of the desert,\r\nso full of attractions for those who have grown to discern somewhat of\r\nNature's hidden joys and sorrows. South Africa became for him a second\r\nMotherland, and one which seemed to him to be more hospitable to his\r\ntemperament than the land of his birth. In South Africa he felt he could\r\nfind more satisfaction and more enjoyment than in England, whose\r\nconventionalities did not appeal to his rebellious, unsophisticated heart.\r\nHe liked to roam about in an old coat and wideawake hat; to forget that\r\ncivilisation existed; to banish from his mind all memory of cities where\r\nman must bow down to Mrs. Grundy and may not defy, unscathed, certain\r\nwell-defined prejudices.\r\n\r\nYet Cecil Rhodes neither cared for convention nor custom. His motto was to\r\ndo what he liked and not to trouble about the judgments of the crowd. He\r\nnever, however, lived up to this last part of his profession because, as I\r\nhave shown already, he was keenly sensitive to praise and to blame, and\r\nhurt to the heart whenever he thought himself misjudged or condemned. Most\r\nof his mistakes proceeded from this over-sensitiveness which, in a certain\r\nsense, hardened him, inasmuch as it made him vindictive against those from\r\nwhom he did not get the approval for which he yearned. In common with many\r\nanother, too, Cecil Rhodes had that turn of mind which harbours resentment\r\nagainst anyone who has scored a point against its possessor. After the\r\nJameson Raid Rhodes never forgave Mr. Schreiner for having found out his\r\ndeceit, and tried to be revenged.\r\n\r\nCecil Rhodes had little sympathy with other people's woes unless these\r\nfound an echo in his own, and the callousness which he so often displayed\r\nwas not entirely the affectation it was thought by his friends or even by\r\nhis enemies. Great in so many things, there were circumstances when he\r\ncould show himself unutterably small, and he seldom practised consistency.\r\nFrank by nature, he was an adept at dissimulation when he thought that his\r\npersonal interest required it. But he could \"face the music,\" however\r\ndiscordant, and, unfortunately for him as well as for his memory, it was\r\noften so.\r\n\r\nThe means by which Cecil Rhodes contrived to acquire so unique a position\r\nin South Africa would require volumes to relate. Wealth alone could not\r\nhave done so, nor could it have assured for him the popularity which he\r\ngained, not only among the European colonists, but also among the coloured\r\npeople, notwithstanding the ruthlessness which he displayed in regard to\r\nthem. There were millionaires far richer than himself in Kimberley and in\r\nJohannesburg. Alfred Beit, to mention only one, could dispose of a much\r\nlarger capital than Rhodes ever possessed, but this did not give him an\r\ninfluence that could be compared with that of his friend, and not even the\r\nLife Governorship of De Beers procured for him any other fame than that of\r\nbeing a fabulously rich man. Barney Barnato and Joel were also familiar\r\nfigures in the circle of wealthy speculators who lived under the shade of\r\nTable Mountain; but none among these men, some of whom were also\r\nremarkable in their way, could effect a tenth or even a millionth part of\r\nwhat Rhodes succeeded in performing. His was the moving spirit, without\r\nwhom these men could never have conceived, far less done, all that they\r\ndid. It was the magic of Rhodes' name which created that formidable\r\norganisation called the De Beers Company; which annexed to the British\r\nEmpire the vast territory known now by the name of Rhodesia; and which\r\nattracted to the gold fields of Johannesburg all those whom they were to\r\nenrich or to ruin. Without the association and glamour of Rhodes' name,\r\ntoo, this area could never have acquired the political importance it\r\npossessed in the few years which preceded, and covered, the Boer War.\r\nRhodes' was the mind which, after bringing about the famous Amalgamation\r\nof the diamond mines around Kimberley, then conceived the idea of turning\r\na private company into a political instrument of a power which would\r\ncontrol public opinion and public life all over South Africa more\r\neffectually even than the Government. This organisation had its own agents\r\nand spies and kept up a wide system of secret service. Under the pretext\r\nof looking out for diamond thieves, these emissaries in reality made it\r\ntheir duty to report on the private opinions and doings of those whose\r\npersonality inspired distrust or apprehension.\r\n\r\nThis organisation was more a dictatorship than anything else, and had\r\nabout it something at once genial and Mephistophelian. The conquest of\r\nRhodesia was nothing in comparison with the power attained by this\r\ncombine, which arrogated to itself almost unchallenged the right to\r\ndomineer over every white man and to subdue every coloured one in the\r\nwhole of the vast South African Continent. Rhodesia, indeed, was only\r\nrendered possible through the power wielded in Cape Colony to bring the\r\ngreat Northward adventure to a successfully definite issue.\r\n\r\nIn referring to Rhodesia, I am reminded of a curious fact which, so far as\r\nI am aware, has never been mentioned in any of the biographies of Mr.\r\nRhodes, but which, on the contrary, has been carefully concealed from the\r\npublic knowledge by his admirers and his satellites. The concession\r\nawarded by King Lobengula to Rhodes and to the few men who together with\r\nhim took it upon themselves to add this piece of territory to the British\r\nEmpire had, in reality, already been given by the dusky monarch--long\r\nbefore the ambitions of De Beers had taken that direction--to a Mr.\r\nSonnenberg, a German Jew who had very quickly amassed a considerable\r\nfortune in various speculations. This Mr. Sonnenberg--who was subsequently\r\nto represent the Dutch party in the Cape Parliament, and who became one of\r\nthe foremost members of the Afrikander Bond--during one of his journeys\r\ninto the interior of the country from Basutoland, where he resided for\r\nsome time, had taken the opportunity of a visit to Matabeleland to obtain\r\na concession from the famous Lobengula. This covered the same ground and\r\nadvantages which, later, were granted to Mr. Rhodes and his business\r\nassociates.\r\n\r\nOwing in some measure to negligence and partly through the impossibility\r\nof raising the enormous capital necessary to make anything profitable out\r\nof the concession, Mr. Sonnenberg had put the document into his drawer\r\nwithout troubling any more about it. Subsequently, when Matabeleland came\r\ninto possession of the Chartered Company, Mr. Sonnenberg ventured to speak\r\nmildly of his own concession, and the matter was mentioned to Mr. Rhodes.\r\nThe latter's reply was typical: \"Tell the ---- fool that if he was fool\r\nenough to lose this chance of making money he ought to take the\r\nconsequences of it.\" And Mr. Sonnenberg had to content himself with this\r\nreply. Being a wise man in his generation he was clever enough to ignore\r\nthe incident, and, realising the principle that might is stronger than\r\nright, he never again attempted to dispute the title of Cecil John Rhodes\r\nto the conquest which he had made, and, as I believe, pushed prudence to\r\nthe extent of consigning his own concession to the flames. He knew but too\r\nwell what his future prosperity would have been worth had he remembered\r\nthe document.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nA COMPLEX PERSONALITY\r\n\r\n\r\nRhodesia and its annexation was but the development of a vast scheme of\r\nconquest that had its start in the wonderful brain of the individual who\r\nby that time had become to be spoken of as the greatest man South Africa\r\nhad ever known. Long before this Cecil Rhodes had entered political life\r\nas member of the Cape Parliament. He stood for the province of Barkly\r\nWest, and his election, which was violently contested, made him master of\r\nthis constituency for the whole of his political career. The entry into\r\npolitics gave a decided aim to his ambitions and inspired him to a new\r\nactivity, directing his wonderful organising faculties toward other than\r\nfinancial victories and instilling within him the desire to make for\r\nhimself a name not solely associated with speculation, but one which would\r\nrank with those great Englishmen who had carried far and wide British\r\nrenown and spread the fame of their Mother Country across the seas.\r\n\r\nRhodes' ambitions were not as unselfish as those of Clive, to mention only\r\nthat one name. He thought far more of himself than of his native land in\r\nthe hours when he meditated on all the advantages which he might obtain\r\nfrom a political career. He saw the way to become at last absolutely free\r\nto give shape to his dreams of conquest, and to hold under his sway the\r\nvast continent which he had insensibly come to consider as his private\r\nproperty. And by this I do not mean Rhodesia only--which he always spoke\r\nof as \"My country\"--but he also referred to Cape Colony in the same way.\r\nWith one distinction, however, which was remarkable: he called it \"My old\r\ncountry,\" thus expressing his conviction that the new one possessed all\r\nhis affections. It is probable that, had time and opportunity been granted\r\nhim to bring into execution his further plans, thereby to establish\r\nhimself at Johannesburg and at Pretoria as firmly as he had done at\r\nKimberley and Buluwayo, the latter townships would have come to occupy the\r\nsame secondary importance in his thoughts as that which Cape Colony had\r\nassumed. Mr. Rhodes may have had a penchant for old clothes, but he\r\ncertainly preferred new countries to ones already explored. To give Rhodes\r\nhis due, he was not the money-grubbing man one would think, judging by his\r\ncompanions. He was constantly planning, constantly dreaming of wider areas\r\nto conquer and to civilise. The possession of gold was for him a means,\r\nnot an aim; he appreciated riches for the power they produced to do\r\nabsolutely all that he wished, but not for the boast of having so many\r\nmillions standing to his account at a bank. He meant to become a king in\r\nhis way, and a king he unquestionably was for a time at least, until his\r\nown hand shattered his throne.\r\n\r\nHis first tenure of the Cape Premiership was most successful, and even\r\nduring the second term his popularity went on growing until the fatal\r\nJameson Raid--an act of folly which nothing can explain, nothing can\r\nexcuse. Until it broke his political career, transforming him from the\r\nrespected statesman whom every party in South Africa looked up to into a\r\nkind of broken idol never more to be trusted, Rhodes had enjoyed the\r\ncomplete confidence of the Dutch party. They fully believed he was the\r\nonly man capable of effecting the Union which at that time was already\r\nconsidered to be indispensable to the prosperity of South Africa. Often he\r\nhad stood up for their rights as the oldest settlers and inhabitants of\r\nthe country. Even in the Transvaal, notwithstanding the authority wielded\r\nthen by President Kruger, the populace would gladly have taken advantage\r\nof his services and of his experience to help them settle favourably their\r\neverlasting quarrels with the Uitlanders, as the English colonists were\r\ncalled.\r\n\r\nHad Cecil Rhodes but had the patience to wait, and had he cared to enter\r\ninto the details of a situation, the intricacies of which none knew better\r\nthan he, it is probable that the annexation of the Transvaal to the\r\nBritish Empire would have taken place as a matter of course and the Boer\r\nWar would never have broken out. Rhodes was not only popular among the\r\nDutch, but also enjoyed their confidence, and it is no secret that he had\r\ncourted them to the extent of exciting the suspicions of the ultra-English\r\nparty, the Jingo elements of which had openly accused him of plotting with\r\nthe Dutch against the authority of Queen Victoria and of wishing to get\r\nhimself elected Life President of a Republic composed of the various South\r\nAfrican States, included in which would be Cape Colony, and perhaps even\r\nNatal, in spite of the preponderance of the English element there.\r\n\r\nThat Rhodes might have achieved such a success is scarcely to be doubted,\r\nand personally I feel sure that there had been moments in his life when\r\nthe idea of it had seriously occurred to him. At least I was led to think\r\nso in the course of a conversation which we had together on this subject a\r\nfew weeks before the Boer War broke out. At that moment Rhodes knew that\r\nwar was imminent, but it would be wrong to interpret that knowledge in the\r\nsense that he had ever thought of or planned rebellion against the Queen.\r\nThose who accused him of harbouring the idea either did not know him or\r\nelse wished to harm him. Rhodes was essentially an Englishman, and set his\r\nown country above everything else in the world. Emphatically this is so;\r\nbut it is equally true that his strange conceptions of morality in matters\r\nwhere politics came into question made him totally oblivious of the fact\r\nthat he thought far more of his own self than of his native land in the\r\nplans which he conceived and formulated for the supremacy of England in\r\nSouth Africa. He was absolutely convinced that his election as Life\r\nPresident of a South African Republic would not be in any way detrimental\r\nto the interests of Great Britain; on the contrary, he assured himself it\r\nwould make the latter far more powerful than it had ever been before in\r\nthe land over which he would reign. By nature something of an Italian\r\n_condottieri_, he considered his native land as a stepping-stone to his\r\nown grandeur.\r\n\r\nFor a good many years he had chosen his best friends among Dutchmen of\r\ninfluence in the Cape Colony and in the Transvaal. He flattered, courted\r\nand praised them until he quite persuaded them that nowhere else would\r\nthey find such a staunch supporter of their rights and of their claims.\r\nMen like Mr. Schreiner,[A] for instance, trusted him absolutely, and\r\nbelieved quite sincerely that in time he would be able to establish firm\r\nand friendly relations between the Cape Government and that of the\r\nTransvaal. Though the latter country had been, as it were, sequestrated by\r\nfriends of Rhodes--much to their own profit--Mr. Schreiner felt convinced\r\nthat the Colossus had never encouraged any plans which these people might\r\nhave made against the independence of the Transvaal Republic. Rhodes had\r\nso completely fascinated him that even on the eve of the day when Jameson\r\ncrossed the Border, Mr. Schreiner, when questioned by one of his friends\r\nabout the rumours which had reached Cape Town concerning a projected\r\ninvasion of the Transvaal by people connected with the Chartered Company,\r\nrepudiated them with energy. Mr. Schreiner, indeed, declared that so long\r\nas Mr. Rhodes was Prime Minister nothing of the kind could or would\r\nhappen, as neither Jameson nor any of his lieutenants would dare to risk\r\nsuch an adventure without the sanction of their Chief, and that it was\r\nmore to the latter's interest than to that of anyone else to preserve the\r\nindependence of the Transvaal Republic.\r\n\r\n    [A] Now High Commissioner for the Union of South Africa.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE RT. HON. W.G. SCHREINER.]\r\n\r\nTalking of Mr. Schreiner reminds me of his sister, the famous Olive\r\nSchreiner, the author of so many books which most certainly will long rank\r\namong the English classics. Olive Schreiner was once upon terms of great\r\nfriendship with Mr. Rhodes, who extremely admired her great talents. She\r\nwas an ardent Afrikander patriot, Dutch by sympathy and origin, gifted\r\nwith singular intelligence and possessed of wide views, which strongly\r\nappealed to the soul and to the spirit of the man who at that time was\r\nconsidered as the greatest figure in South Africa.\r\n\r\nIt is not remarkable, therefore, that Rhodes should fall into the habit\r\nof confiding in Miss Schreiner, whom he found was \"miles above\" the\r\npeople about him. He used to hold long conversations with her and to\r\ninitiate her into many of his plans for the future, plans in which the\r\ninterests and the welfare of the Cape Dutch, as well as the Transvaalers,\r\nused always to play the principal part. His friendship with her, however,\r\nwas viewed with great displeasure by many who held watch around him.\r\nCircumstances--intentionally brought about, some maintain--conspired to\r\ncause a cooling of the friendship between the two most remarkable\r\npersonalities in South Africa. Later on, Miss Schreiner, who was an ardent\r\npatriot, having discovered what she termed and considered to be the\r\nduplicity of the man in whom she had so absolutely trusted, refused to\r\nmeet Cecil Rhodes again. Her famous book, \"Trooper Peter Halkett of\r\nMashonaland,\" was the culminating point in their quarrel, and the break\r\nbecame complete.\r\n\r\nThis, however, was but an incident in a life in which the feminine element\r\nnever had any great influence, perhaps because it was always kept in check\r\nby people anxious and eager not to allow it to occupy a place in the\r\nthoughts or in the existence of a man whom they had confiscated as their\r\nown property. There are people who, having risen from nothing to the\r\nheights of a social position, are able to shake off former associations:\r\nthis was not the case with Rhodes, who, on the contrary, as he advanced in\r\npower and in influence, found himself every day more embarrassed by the\r\nmen who had clung to him when he was a diamond digger, and who, through\r\nhis financial acumen, had built up their fortunes. They surrounded him day\r\nand night, eliminating every person likely to interfere; slandering,\r\nridiculing and calumniating them in turns, they at last left him nothing\r\nin place of his shattered faiths and lost ideals, until Rhodes became as\r\nisolated amidst his greatness and his millions as the veriest beggar in\r\nhis hovel.\r\n\r\nIt was a sad sight to watch the ethical degradation of one of the most\r\nremarkable intelligences among the men of his generation; it was\r\nheartrending to see him fall every day more and more into the power of\r\nunscrupulous people who did nothing else but exploit him for their own\r\nbenefit. South Africa has always been the land of adventurers, and many a\r\nqueer story could be told. That of Cecil John Rhodes was, perhaps, the\r\nmost wonderful and the most tragic.\r\n\r\nWhether he realised this retrogression himself it is difficult to say.\r\nSometimes one felt that such might be the case, whilst at others it seemed\r\nas if he viewed his own fate only as something absolutely wonderful and\r\nbound to develop in the future even more prosperously than it had done in\r\nthe past. There was always about him something of the \"tragediante,\r\ncomediante\" applied to Napoleon by Pope Pius VII., and it is absolutely\r\ncertain that he often feigned sentiments which he did not feel, anger\r\nwhich he did not experience, and pleasure that he did not have. He was a\r\nbeing of fits and starts, moods and fancies, who liked to pose in such a\r\nway as to give others an absolutely false idea of his personality when he\r\nconsidered it useful to his interests to do so. At times it was evident he\r\nexperienced regret, but it is doubtful whether he knew the meaning of\r\nremorse. The natives seldom occupied his thoughts, and if he were reminded\r\nin later years that, after all, terrible cruelties had been practised in\r\nMashonaland or in Matabeleland, he used simply to shrug his shoulders and\r\nto remark that it was impossible to make an omelette without breaking some\r\neggs. It never occurred to him that there might exist people who objected\r\nto the breaking of a certain kind of eggs, and that humanity had a right\r\nto be considered even in conquest.\r\n\r\nAnd, after all, was this annexation of the dominions of poor Lobengula a\r\nconquest? If one takes into account the strength of the people who\r\nattacked the savage king, and his own weakness, can one do else but regret\r\nthat those who slaughtered Lobengula did not remember the rights of mercy\r\nin regard to a fallen foe? There are dark deeds connected with the\r\nattachment of Rhodesia to the British Empire, deeds which would never have\r\nbeen performed by a regular English Army, but which seemed quite natural\r\nto the band of enterprising fellows who had staked their fortunes on an\r\nexpedition which it was their interest to represent as a most dangerous\r\nand difficult affair. I do not want to disparage them or their courage,\r\nbut I cannot help questioning whether they ever had to withstand any\r\nserious attack of the enemy. I have been told perfectly sickening details\r\nconcerning this conquest of the territory now known by the name of\r\nRhodesia. The cruel manner in which, after having wrung from them a\r\nconcession which virtually despoiled them of every right over their native\r\nland and after having goaded these people into exasperation, the people\r\nthemselves were exterminated was terrible beyond words. For instance,\r\nthere occurred the incident mentioned by Olive Schreiner in \"Trooper Peter\r\nHalkett of Mashonaland,\" when over one hundred savages were suffocated\r\nalive in a cave where they sought a refuge.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I remain persuaded that these abominable deeds remained\r\nunknown to Mr. Rhodes and that he would not have tolerated them for one\r\nsingle instant. They were performed by people who were in possession of\r\nRhodes' confidence, and who abused it by allowing the world to think that\r\nhe encouraged such deeds. Later on it is likely that he became aware of\r\nthe abuse that had been made of his name and of the manner in which it had\r\nbeen put forward as an excuse for inexcusable deeds, but he was far too\r\nindolent and far too indifferent to the blame of the world, at these\r\nparticular moments to disavow those who, after all, had helped him in his\r\nschemes of expansion, and who had ministered to his longing to have a\r\nkingdom to himself. Apart from this, he had a curious desire to brave\r\npublic opinion and to do precisely the very things that it would have\r\ndisapproved. He loved to humiliate those whom he had at one moment thought\r\nhe might have occasion to fear. This explains the callousness with which\r\nhe made the son of Lobengula one of his gardeners, and did not hesitate to\r\nask him one day before strangers who were visiting Groote Schuur in what\r\nyear he \"had killed his father.\" The incident is absolutely true; it\r\noccurred in my own presence.\r\n\r\nAt times, such as that related in the paragraph above, Rhodes appeared a\r\nperfectly detestable and hateful creature, and yet he was never sincere\r\nwhilst in such moods. A few moments later he would show himself under\r\nabsolutely different colours and give proof of a compassionate heart.\r\nGenerous to a fault, he liked to be able to oblige his friends, or those\r\nwho passed as such, while the charitable acts which he was constantly\r\nperforming are too numerous to be remembered. He had a supreme contempt\r\nfor money, but he spoiled the best sides of his strange, eccentric\r\ncharacter by enjoying a display of its worst facets with a \"cussedness\" as\r\namusing as it was sometimes unpleasant. Is it remarkable, then, that many\r\npeople who only saw him in the disagreeable moods should judge him from an\r\nentirely false and misleading point of view?\r\n\r\nRhodes was a man for whom it was impossible to feel indifference; one\r\neither hated him or became fascinated by his curious and peculiar charm.\r\nThis quality led many admirers to remain faithful to him even after\r\ndisillusion had shattered their former friendship, and who, whilst\r\nrefusing to speak to him any more, yet retained for him a deep affection\r\nwhich not even the conviction that it had been misplaced could alter. This\r\nis a remarkable and indisputable fact. After having rallied around him all\r\nthat was honest in South Africa; after having been the petted child of all\r\nthe old and influential ladies in Cape Town; after having been accepted as\r\ntheir leader by men like Mr. Schreiner and Mr. Hofmeyr, who, clever though\r\nthey were, and convinced, as they must have been, of their personal\r\ninfluence on the Dutch party and the members of the Afrikander Bond, still\r\npreferred to subordinate their judgment to Rhodes'; after having enjoyed\r\nsuch unparalleled confidence, Rhodes had come to be spurned and rejected\r\npolitically, but had always kept his place in their hearts. Fate and his\r\nown faults separated him from these people of real weight and influence,\r\nand left him in the hands of those who pretended that they were attached\r\nto him, but who, in reality, cared only for the material advantages that\r\ntheir constant attendance upon him procured to them. They poisoned his\r\nmind, they separated him from all those who might have been useful to him,\r\nand they profited by the circumstance that the Raid had estranged him from\r\nhis former friends to strengthen their own influence upon him, and to\r\npersuade him that those who had deplored the rash act were personal\r\nenemies, wishful for his downfall and disgrace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nMRS. VAN KOOPMAN\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong those with whom Rhodes had been intimate from almost the first days\r\nof his establishment in Cape Town and his entrance into political life was\r\na lady who, for something like half a century, had been enjoying an\r\nenviable position throughout almost the whole of South Africa. Mrs. van\r\nKoopman was a Dutchwoman of considerable means and of high character. She\r\nwas clever, well read, and her quick intelligence allowed her to hold her\r\nown in discussion upon any subject against the most eminent men of her\r\ngeneration. She had never made a secret of her Dutch sympathies, nor of\r\nher desire to see her countrymen given equal rights with the English all\r\nover South Africa. She was on excellent terms with President Kruger, and\r\nwith President Steyn, whose personality was a far more remarkable one than\r\nthat of his old and crafty colleague.\r\n\r\nThe leading South African political men used to meet at Mrs. van Koopman's\r\nto discuss the current events of the day. It is related that she was one\r\nof the first to bring to the notice of her friends the complications that\r\nwere bound to follow upon the discovery of the gold fields, and to implore\r\nthem to define, without delay, the position of the foreign element which\r\nwas certain to move toward Johannesburg as soon as the news of the riches\r\ncontained in that region became public property.\r\n\r\nIf the English Government had considered the matter at once the\r\ncomplications which arose as soon as companies began to be formed would\r\nhave been less acute. The directors of these concerns imagined themselves\r\nto be entitled to displace local government, and took all executive power\r\ninto their own hands. This would never have happened if firm governmental\r\naction had been promptly taken. The example of Kimberley ought to have\r\nopened the eyes of the Mother Country, and measures should have been taken\r\nto prevent the purely commercial domain of the gold fields from assuming\r\nsuch strident political activities, and little by little dominating not\r\nonly the Transvaal Republic, but also the rest of South Africa.\r\n\r\nMrs. van Koopman had cherished a great affection for Rhodes. Her age--she\r\nwas in the sixties--gave an almost maternal character to the tenderness\r\nwith which she viewed him. He had made her his confidante, telling her all\r\nthat he meant to do for the welfare of the land which she loved so dearly.\r\nShe thought he looked upon South Africa with the same feelings of\r\nadmiration as she did.\r\n\r\nThe strength of her belief led Mrs. van Koopman to interest all her\r\nfriends in the career of the young Englishman, who appealed to her\r\nimagination as the embodiment of all that was great and good. Her\r\nenthusiasm endowed him with many qualities that he did not possess, and\r\nmagnified those which he really had. When he consulted her as to his\r\nfuture plans she entered closely into their details, discussed with him\r\ntheir chances of success, advised him and used all her influence, which\r\nwas great, in winning him friends and adherents. She trusted him fully,\r\nand, on his part, whenever he returned to Cape Town after one of his\r\nyearly visits to Kimberley, or after a few months spent in the solitudes\r\nof Rhodesia, his first visit was always to the old and gentle lady, who\r\nwelcomed him with open arms, words of affection, and sincere as well as\r\ndevoted sympathy. She had always refused to listen to disparagement of her\r\nfavourite, and would never allow any of the gruesome details connected\r\nwith the annexation of Rhodesia to be recited in her presence.\r\n\r\nIn Mrs. van Koopman's eyes there was only a glorious side to the Rhodesian\r\nexpedition, and she rejoiced in the renown which it was destined to bring\r\nto the man who had conceived and planned it. She fully believed that\r\nRhodes meant to bring English civilisation, English laws, the English\r\nsense of independence and respect for individual freedom into that distant\r\nland. The fact that lucre lay at the bottom of the expedition never\r\ncrossed her mind; even if it had she would have rejected the thought with\r\nscorn and contempt.\r\n\r\nAlthough the attacks upon Cecil Rhodes increased day by day in intensity\r\nand in bitterness, Mrs. van Koopman never wavered in her allegiance. She\r\nattributed them to jealousy and envy, and strenuously defended his name.\r\nMrs. van Koopman, too, rejoiced at any new success of Rhodes as if it had\r\nbeen her own. She was the first to congratulate him when the dignity of a\r\nPrivy Councillor was awarded to him. After the Matabele Rebellion, during\r\nwhich occurred one of the most famous episodes in the life of Rhodes, Mrs.\r\nvan Koopman had been loud in her praises of the man whom she had been the\r\nfirst to guess would do great things.\r\n\r\nThe episode to which I refer, when he alone had had the courage to go\r\nunattended and unarmed to meet the savage chiefs assembled in the Matoppo\r\nHills, had, by the way, done more than anything else to consolidate the\r\nposition of the chairman of De Beers in South Africa.\r\n\r\nDuring the first administration of Cape Colony by Mr. Rhodes, when his\r\naccession to the premiership had been viewed with a certain suspicion by\r\nthe Dutch party, Mrs. van Koopman made tremendous efforts to induce them\r\nto have full confidence in her protégé. And the attempt succeeded, because\r\neven the shrewd Mr. Hofmeyr had at last succumbed to the constant\r\nentreaties which she had poured upon him. Thenceforward Mr. Hofmeyr became\r\none of Mr. Rhodes' firm admirers and strong partisans. Under the able\r\nguidance of Mrs. van Koopman the relations between the Dutch party and\r\ntheir future enemy became so cordial that at last a singular construction\r\nwas put upon both sides of the alliance by the opponents of both. The\r\naccusation, already referred to, was made against Rhodes that he wished to\r\nmake for himself in South Africa a position of such independence and\r\nstrength that even the authority of the Queen might find itself\r\ncompromised by it. As has been pointed out, the supposition was devoid of\r\ntruth, but it is quite certain that the then Premier of Cape Colony would\r\nnot have objected had the suzerainty been placed in his hands by England\r\nand British rule in South Africa vested solely in his person.\r\n\r\nDuring a brief interval in his political leadership Rhodes pursued his\r\nwork in Rhodesia. In those days the famous British South Africa Company,\r\nwhich was to become known as the Chartered Company, was definitely\r\nconstituted, and began its activity in the new territories which had come\r\nunder its control. Ere long, though, the tide of events brought him again\r\nto the head of the Government. This time, however, though his appointment\r\nhad been considered as a foregone conclusion, and though very few had\r\nopposed it, he no longer met the same sympathetic attention and\r\nco-operation which had characterised his first administration of public\r\naffairs. The Colony had begun to realise that Mr. Rhodes alone, and left\r\nfree to do what he liked, or what he believed was right, was very\r\ndifferent from Mr. Rhodes under the influence of the many so-called\r\nfinanciers and would-be politicians who surrounded him.\r\n\r\nAn atmosphere of favouritism and of flattery had changed Rhodes, whom one\r\nwould have thought far above such small things. Vague rumours, too, had\r\nbegun to circulate concerning certain designs of the Chartered Company\r\n(one did not dare yet mention the name of its chief and chairman) on the\r\nTransvaal. Rhodes was directly questioned upon the subject by several of\r\nhis friends, amongst others by Mr. Schreiner, to whom he energetically\r\ndenied that such a thing had ever been planned. He added that Doctor\r\nJameson, of whom the man in the street was already speaking as the man who\r\nwas planning an aggression against the authority of President Kruger, was\r\nnot even near the frontier of the neighbouring Republic. The mere idea of\r\nsuch a thing, Rhodes emphatically declared to Mr. Schreiner, was nothing\r\nbut an ill-natured hallucination to create bad blood between the English\r\nand the Dutch. His tone seemed so sincere that Mr. Schreiner allowed\r\nhimself to be convinced, and voluntarily assured his colleagues that he\r\nwas convinced of the sincerity of the Prime Minister.\r\n\r\nThe only person who was really alarmed at the persistent rumours which\r\ncirculated in Cape Town in regard to a possible attack in common accord\r\nwith the leaders of the Reform movement in Johannesburg against the\r\nindependence of the Transvaal Republic was Mrs. van Koopman. She knew\r\nRhodes' character too well not to fear that he might have been induced to\r\nlisten to the misguided advice of people trying to persuade him that the\r\nRhodesian adventure was susceptible of being repeated on a larger and far\r\nmore important scale, with as much impunity and as little danger as the\r\nother one had been. Alarmed beyond words by all that she was hearing, she\r\ndetermined to find out for herself the true state of things, and, trusting\r\nto her knowledge of Rhodes' character, she asked him to call upon her.\r\n\r\nRhodes came a few afternoons later, and Mrs. van Koopman closely\r\nquestioned him on the subject, telling him of the tales which were being\r\ncirculated not only in Cape Town, but also at Kimberley and Buluwayo and\r\nJohannesburg. Rhodes solemnly assured her that they were nothing but\r\nmalicious gossip, and, taking her hands in his own, he repeated that all\r\nshe had heard concerning the sinister designs he was supposed to be\r\nharbouring against the independence of the Transvaal had absolutely no\r\nfoundation. To add force to his words, he continued that he respected her\r\nfar too much to deceive her willingly, and that he would never have risked\r\nmeeting her and talking with her upon such a subject had there been the\r\nslightest ground for the rumours which were disturbing the tranquillity of\r\nthe inhabitants of Cape Town. When he left her Mrs. van Koopman felt quite\r\nreassured.\r\n\r\nNext morning Mrs. van Koopman told her anxious friends that she had\r\nreceived such assurances from Rhodes that she could not disbelieve him,\r\nand that the best thing which they could do would be to contradict all\r\nstatements on the subject of a raid on the Transvaal that might come to\r\ntheir ears. This occurred on an after-Christmas evening of the year 1895.\r\n\r\nWhen the decisive conversation which I have just related was taking place\r\nbetween Mrs. van Koopman and Cecil Rhodes, Doctor Jameson and his handful\r\nof eager adventurers had already entered Transvaal territory. The Raid had\r\nbecome an accomplished fact. It was soon realised that it was the most\r\ndeplorable affair that could have occurred for the reputation of Cecil\r\nRhodes and for his political future. The rebound, indeed, was immediate;\r\nhis political career came to an end that day.\r\n\r\nThe person who was struck most painfully by this disgraceful and cryingly\r\nstupid adventure was Mrs. van Koopman. All her illusions--and she had\r\nnursed many concerning Rhodes--were destroyed at one blow. She never\r\nforgave him. All his attempts to bring about a reconciliation failed, and\r\nwhen later on he would fain have obtained her forgiveness, she absolutely\r\nrefused all advances, and declared that she would never consent willingly\r\nto look upon his face or listen to his voice again. The proud old woman,\r\nwhose ideals had been wrecked so cruelly, could not but feel a profound\r\ncontempt for a man who had thus deliberately lied to her at the very time\r\nwhen she was appealing to his confidence. Her aristocratic instincts arose\r\nin indignation at the falsehoods which had been used to dupe her. She\r\nwould not listen to any excuse, would not admit any extenuating\r\ncircumstances; and perhaps because she knew in the secret of her heart\r\nthat she would never be able to resist the pleadings of the man who had\r\nthus deceived her, she absolutely refused to see him.\r\n\r\nRhodes never despaired of being restored to her favour, and would have\r\ngiven much to anyone able to induce her to relent in her judgment as to\r\nhis conduct. Up to the last he made attempts to persuade her to reconsider\r\nher decision, but they all proved useless, and he died without having been\r\nable to win a forgiveness which he craved for many years.\r\n\r\nI used to know Mrs. van Koopman well and to see her often. I admired her\r\nmuch, not only on account of her great talents and of her powerful\r\nintellect, but also for the great dignity which she displayed all through\r\nthe Boer War, when, suspected of favouring the Dutch cause to the extent\r\nof holding communications with the rebels all over the Cape Colony, she\r\nnever committed any indiscretion or gave cause for any direct action\r\nagainst her. For some time, by order of the military authorities, she was\r\nplaced under police supervision, and her house was searched for papers and\r\ndocuments which, however, were not found--as might have been foreseen.\r\n\r\nAll through these trying months she never wavered in her attitude nor in\r\nher usual mode of life, except that she saw fewer people than\r\nformerly--not, as she used playfully to say, because she feared to be\r\ncompromised, but because she did not wish to compromise others. More than\r\nonce during my visits I spoke to her of Mr. Rhodes and tried to induce her\r\nto relent in her resolution. I even went so far as to tell her that her\r\nconsent to meet him would, more than anything else, cause him to use all\r\nhis influence, or what remained of it, in favour of a prompt settlement of\r\nthe war in a peace honourable to both sides. Mrs. van Koopman smiled, but\r\nremained immovable. At last, seeing that I would not abandon the subject,\r\nshe told me in tones which admitted of no discussion that she had far too\r\nmuch affection for Rhodes not to have been so entirely cut to the core by\r\nhis duplicity in regard to her and by his whole conduct in that\r\nunfortunate matter of the Raid. She could trust him no longer, she told\r\nme, and, consequently, a meeting with him would only give her unutterable\r\npain and revive memories that had better remain undisturbed. \"Had I cared\r\nfor him less I would not say so to you,\" she added, \"but you must know\r\nthat of all sad things the saddest is the destruction of idols one has\r\nbuilt for oneself.\"\r\n\r\nThis attitude on the part of the one friend he had the greatest affection\r\nfor was one of the many episodes which embittered Rhodes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nRHODES AND THE RAID\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the Raid, faithful to his usual tactics of making others responsible\r\nfor his own misdeeds, Cecil Rhodes grew to hate with ferocity all those\r\nwhose silence and quiet disapproval reminded him of the fatal error into\r\nwhich he had been led. He was loud in his expressions of resentment\r\nagainst Mr. Schreiner and the other members of the Afrikander party who\r\nhad not been able to conceal from him their indignation at his conduct on\r\nthe memorable occasion which ruined his own political life. They had\r\ncompelled him--one judged by his demeanour--to resign his office of Prime\r\nMinister at the very time when he was about to transform it into something\r\nfar more important--to use it as the stepping-stone to future grandeurs of\r\nwhich he already dreamt, although he had so far refrained from speaking\r\nabout them to others. Curious to say, however, he never blamed the authors\r\nof this political mistake, and never, in public at least, reproached\r\nJameson for the disaster he had brought upon him.\r\n\r\nWhat his secret thoughts were on this subject it is easy to guess.\r\nCircumstances used to occur now and then when a stray word spoken on\r\nimpulse allowed one to discern that he deplored the moment of weakness\r\ninto which he had been inveigled. For instance, during a dinner-party at\r\nGroote Schuur, when talking about the state of things prevailing in\r\nJohannesburg just before the war, he mentioned the names of five Reformers\r\nwho, after the Raid, had been condemned to death by President Kruger, and\r\nadded that he had paid their fine of twenty-five thousand pounds each.\r\n\"Yes,\" he continued, with a certain grim accent of satire in his voice, \"I\r\npaid £25,000 for each of these gentlemen.\" And when one of his guests\r\ntactlessly remarked, \"But surely you need not have done so, Mr. Rhodes? It\r\nwas tacitly admitting that you had been a party to their enterprise!\" he\r\nretorted immediately, \"And if I choose to allow the world to think that\r\nsuch was the case, what business is it of yours?\" I thought the man was\r\ngoing to drop under the table, so utterly flabbergasted did he look.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, extremely difficult to know what was the actual part\r\nplayed by Rhodes in the Raid. He carried that secret to the grave, and it\r\nis not likely that his accomplices will ever reveal their own share in the\r\nresponsibility for that wild adventure. My impression is that the idea of\r\nthe Raid was started among the entourage of Rhodes and spoken of before\r\nhim at length. He would listen in silence, as was his wont when he wished\r\nto establish the fact that he had nothing to do with a thing that had been\r\nsubmitted to him. Thus the Raid was tacitly encouraged by him, without his\r\never having pronounced himself either for or against it.\r\n\r\nRhodes was an extremely able politician, and a far-seeing one into the\r\nbargain. He would never have committed himself into an open approval of an\r\nattempt which he knew perfectly well involved the rights of nations. On\r\nthe other hand, he would have welcomed any circumstance which would result\r\nin the overthrow of the Transvaal Republic by friends of his. His former\r\nsuccesses, and especially the facility with which had been carried out the\r\nattachment of Rhodesia to the British Empire, had refracted his vision,\r\nand he refused--or failed--to see the difficulties which he might\r\nencounter if he wanted to proceed for the second time on an operation of\r\nthe same kind.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, he was worried by his friends to allow them to take\r\ndecisive action, and was told that everyone in England would approve of\r\nhis initiative in taking upon himself the responsibility of a step, out of\r\nwhich could only accrue solid advantage for the Mother Country.\r\n\r\nRhodes had been too long away from England, and his sojourns there during\r\nthe ten years or so immediately preceding 1895 had been far too short for\r\nhim to have been able to come to a proper appreciation of the importance\r\nof public opinion in Great Britain, or of those principles in matters of\r\nGovernment which no sound English politician will ever dare to put aside\r\nif he wishes to retain his hold. He failed to understand and to appreciate\r\nthe narrow limit which must not be overstepped; he forgot that when one\r\nwants to perform an act open to certain well-defined objections there must\r\nbe a great aim in order eventually to explain and excuse the doing of it.\r\nThe Raid had no such aim. No one made a mistake as to that point when\r\npassing judgment upon the Raid. The motives were too sordid, too mean, for\r\nanyone to do aught else but pass a sweeping condemnation upon the whole\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nIf he did not, Rhodes ought to have known that the public would most\r\ncertainly pass this verdict on so dark and shameful an adventure, one that\r\nharmed England's prestige in South Africa far more than ever did the Boer\r\nWar. But though perhaps he realised beforehand that this would be the\r\nverdict, he only felt a vague apprehension, more as a fancy than from any\r\nreal sense of impending danger. He had grown so used to see success attend\r\nhis every step that his imagination refused to admit the possibility of\r\ndefeat.\r\n\r\nAs for the people who engaged in the senseless adventure, their motives\r\nhad none of the lofty ideals which influenced Rhodes himself. They simply\r\nwanted to obtain possession of the gold fields of the Transvaal and to\r\noust the rightful owners. President Kruger represented an obstacle that\r\nhad to be removed, and so they proceeded upon their mad quest without\r\nregard as to the possible consequences. Still less did they reflect that\r\nin his case they had not to deal with a native chief whose voice of\r\nprotest had no chance to be heard, but with a very cute and determined man\r\nwho had means at his disposal not only to defend himself, but also to\r\nappeal to European judgment to adjudge an unjustifiable aggression.\r\n\r\nApart from all these considerations, which ought to have been seriously\r\ntaken into account by Doctor Jameson and his companions, the whole\r\nexpedition was planned in a stupid, careless manner. No wonder that it\r\nimmediately came to grief. It is probable that if Rhodes had entered into\r\nits details and allowed others to consult him, matters might have taken a\r\ndifferent turn. But, as I have already shown, he preferred to be able to\r\nsay at a given moment that he had known nothing about it. At least, this\r\nmust have been what he meant to do. But events proved too strong for him.\r\nThe fiasco was too complete for Rhodes to escape from its\r\nresponsibilities, though it must be conceded that he never tried to do so\r\nonce the storm burst. He faced the music bravely enough, perhaps because\r\nof the knowledge that no denial would be believed, perhaps also because\r\nall the instincts of his, after all, great nature caused him to come\r\nforward to take his share in the disgrace of the whole deplorable affair.\r\n\r\nWhether he forgave Doctor Jameson for this act of folly remains a mystery.\r\nPersonally I have always held that there must have _un cadavre entre eux_.\r\nNo friendship could account for the strange relations which existed\r\nbetween these two men, one of whom had done so much to harm the other. At\r\nfirst it would have seemed as if an individual of the character of Cecil\r\nRhodes would never have brought himself to forgive his confederate for the\r\nclumsiness with which he had handled a matter upon which the reputation of\r\nboth of them depended, in the present as well as in the future. But far\r\nfrom abandoning the friend who had brought him into such trouble, he\r\nremained on the same terms of intimacy as before, with the difference,\r\nperhaps, that he saw even more of him than before the Raid. It seemed as\r\nif he wanted thus to affirm before the whole world his faith in the man\r\nthrough whom his whole political career had been wrecked.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of Rhodes toward Jameson was commented upon far and wide. The\r\nDutch party in Cape Town saw in it a mere act of bravado into which they\r\nread an acknowledgment that, strong as was the Colossus, he was too weak\r\nto tell his accomplices to withdraw from public sight until the\r\never-increasing difficulties with the Transvaal--which became more and\r\nmore acute after the Raid--had been settled in some way or other between\r\nPresident Kruger and the British Government. Instead of this Rhodes seemed\r\nto take a particular pleasure in parading the trust he declared he had in\r\nDoctor Jameson, and to consult him publicly upon almost all the political\r\nquestions which were submitted to him for consideration. This did not mean\r\nthat he followed the advice which he received, because, so far as I was\r\nable to observe, this was seldom the case.\r\n\r\nTo add to the contrariness of the situation, Rhodes always seemed more\r\nglad than anything else if he heard someone make an ill-natured remark\r\nabout the Doctor, or when anything particularly disagreeable occurred to\r\nthe latter. An ironic smile used to light up Rhodes' face and a sarcastic\r\nchuckle be heard. But still, whenever one attempted to explain to him that\r\nthe Raid had been an unforgivable piece of imprudence, or hazarded that\r\nJameson had never been properly punished for it, Rhodes invariably took\r\nthe part of this friend of his younger days, and would never acknowledge\r\nthat Doctor Jim's desire to enter public life as a member of the Cape\r\nParliament ought not to be gratified.\r\n\r\nOn his side, Doctor Jameson was determined that the opportunity to do so\r\nshould be offered to him, and he used Rhodes' influence in order to obtain\r\nelection. He knew very well that without it his candidature would have no\r\nchance.\r\n\r\nLater on, when judging the events which preceded the last two years of\r\nRhodes' life, many people expressed the opinion that Jameson, being a\r\nphysician of unusual ability, was perfectly well aware that his friend was\r\nnot destined to live to a very old age, and therefore wished to obtain\r\nfrom him while he could all the political support he required to establish\r\nhis career as the statesman he fully believed he was. In fact, Doctor\r\nJameson had made up his mind to outlive the odium of the Raid, and to\r\nbecome rehabilitated in public opinion to the extent of being allowed to\r\ntake up the leadership of the party which had once owned Rhodes as its\r\nchief. By a strange freak of Providence, helped no doubt by an iron will\r\nand opportunities made the most of, Jameson, who had been the great\r\nculprit in the mad adventure of the Raid, became the foremost man in Cape\r\nColony for a brief period after the war, while Rhodes, who had been his\r\nvictim, bore the full consequences of his weakness in having permitted\r\nhimself to be persuaded to look through his fingers on the enterprise.\r\n\r\nRhodes never recovered any real political influence, was distrusted by\r\nEnglish and Dutch alike, looked upon with caution by the Cape Government,\r\nand with suspicion even among his followers. The poor man had no friends\r\nworthy of the name, and those upon whom he relied the most were the first\r\nto betray his confidence. Unfortunately for himself, he had a profound\r\ncontempt for humanity, and imagined himself capable of controlling all\r\nthose whom he had elected to rule. He imagined he could turn and twist\r\nanyone according to his own impulses. In support of this assertion let me\r\nrelate an incident in which I played a part.\r\n\r\nWhen the Boer War showed symptoms of dragging on for a longer time than\r\nexpected, some Englishmen proposed that Rhodes should be asked to stand\r\nagain for Prime Minister, to do which he resolutely refused. Opinions,\r\nhowever, were very much divided. Some people declared that he was the only\r\nman capable of conciliating the Dutch and bringing the war to a happy\r\nissue. Others asserted that his again taking up the reins of Government\r\nwould be considered by the Afrikander Bond--which was very powerful at the\r\ntime--as an unjustifiable provocation which would only further embitter\r\nthose who had never forgiven Rhodes for the Raid.\r\n\r\nA member of the Upper House of Legislature, whom I used to see often, and\r\nwho was a strong partisan of Rhodes, determined to seek advice outside the\r\nHouse, and went to see an important political personage in Cape Town, one\r\nof those who frequented Groote Schuur and who posed as one of the\r\nstrongest advocates of Rhodes again becoming the head of the Government\r\npresided over by Sir Alfred Milner. What was the surprise of my friend\r\nwhen, instead of finding a sympathising auditor, he heard him say that he\r\nconsidered that for the moment the return of Rhodes at the head of affairs\r\nwould only complicate matters; that it was still too soon after the Raid;\r\nthat his spirit of animosity in regard to certain people might not help to\r\nsmooth matters at such a critical juncture; and that, moreover, Rhodes had\r\ngrown very morose and tyrannical, and refused to brook any contradiction.\r\nComing from a man who had no reason to be friendly with Rhodes, the\r\nremarks just reported would not have been important, but proceeding from a\r\npersonage who was continually flattering Rhodes, they struck me as showing\r\nsuch considerable duplicity that I wrote warning Rhodes not to attach too\r\nmuch importance to the protestations of devotion to his person that the\r\nindividual in question was perpetually pouring down upon him. The reply\r\nwhich I received was absolutely characteristic: \"Thanks for your letter.\r\nNever mind what X---- says. He is a harmless donkey who can always make\r\nhimself useful when required to do so.\"\r\n\r\nThe foregoing incident is enlightening as to the real nature of Cecil\r\nRhodes. His great mistake was precisely in this conviction that he could\r\norder men at will, and that men would never betray him or injure him by\r\ntheir false interpretation of the directions which it pleased him to give\r\nthem. He considered himself so entirely superior to the rest of mankind\r\nthat it never struck him that inferior beings could turn upon him and rend\r\nhim, or forget the obedience to his orders which he expected them to\r\nobserve. He did not appreciate people with independence, though he admired\r\nthem in those rare moments when he would condescend to be sincere with\r\nhimself and with others; but he preferred a great deal the miserable\r\ncreatures who always said \"yes\" to all his vagaries; who never dared to\r\ncriticise any of his instructions or to differ from any opinions which he\r\nexpressed. Sometimes he uttered these opinions with a brutality that did\r\nhim considerable harm, inasmuch as it could not fail to cause repugnance\r\namong any who listened to him, but were not sufficiently acquainted with\r\nthe peculiarities of his character to discern that he wanted simply to\r\nscare his audience, and that he did not mean one single word of the\r\nferocious things he said in those moments when he happened to be in a\r\nparticularly perverse mood, and when it pleased him to give a totally\r\nfalse impression of himself and the nature of his convictions in political\r\nand public matters.\r\n\r\nIt must not be lost sight of when judging Mr. Rhodes that he had been\r\nliving for the best part of his life among people with whom he could not\r\nhave anything in common except the desire to make money in the shortest\r\ntime possible. He was by nature a thinker, a philosopher, a reader, a man\r\nwho belonged to the best class of students, those who understand that\r\none's mind wants continually improving and that it is apt to rust when not\r\nkept active. His companions in those first years which followed upon his\r\narrival in South Africa would certainly not have appreciated any of the\r\nbooks the reading of which constituted the solace of the young man who\r\nstill preserved in his mind the traditions of Oxford. They were his\r\ninferiors in everything: intelligence, instruction, comprehension of those\r\nhigher problems of the soul and of the mind which always interested him\r\neven in the most troubled and anxious moments of his life. He understood\r\nand realised that this was the fact, and this did not tend to inspire him\r\nwith esteem or even with consideration for the people with whom he was\r\ncompelled to live and work.\r\n\r\nMen like Barney Barnato, to mention only this one name among the many,\r\nfelt a kind of awe of Cecil Rhodes. This kind of thing, going on as it did\r\nfor years, was bound to give Rhodes a wrong idea as to the faculty he had\r\nof bringing others to share his points of view, and he became so\r\naccustomed to be considered always right that he felt surprised and vexed\r\nwhenever blind obedience was not given. Indeed, it so excited his\r\ndispleasure that he would at once plunge into a course of conduct which he\r\nmight never have adopted but for the fact that he had heard it condemned\r\nor criticised.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that every rich man is generally surrounded by parasites,\r\nand Cecil Rhodes was not spared this infliction. Only in his case these\r\nparasites did not apply their strength to attacks upon his purse; they\r\nexploited him for his influence, for the importance which it gave them to\r\nbe considered by the world as his friends, or even his dependants. They\r\nappeared wherever he went, telling the general public that their presence\r\nhad been requested by the \"Boss\" in such warm terms that they could not\r\nrefuse. It was curious to watch this systematic chase which followed him\r\neverywhere, even to England. Sometimes this persistency on the part of\r\npersons whom he did not tolerate more than was absolutely necessary bored\r\nhim and put him out of patience; but most of the time he accepted it as a\r\nnecessary evil, and even felt flattered by it. He also liked to have\r\nperpetually around him individuals whom he could bully to his heart's\r\ncontent, who never resented an insult and never minded an insolence--and\r\nRhodes was often insolent.\r\n\r\nAnother singular feature in a character as complex as it was interesting\r\nwas the contempt in which he held all those who had risen under his very\r\neyes, from comparative or absolute poverty, to the status of millionaires\r\npossessed of houses in Park Lane and shooting boxes in Scotland. He liked\r\nto relate all that he knew about them, and sometimes even to mention\r\ncertain facts which the individuals themselves would probably have\r\npreferred to be consigned to oblivion. But--and here comes the singularity\r\nto which I have referred--Rhodes would not allow anyone else to speak of\r\nthese things, and he always took the part of his so-called friends when\r\noutsiders hinted at dark episodes which did not admit of investigation. He\r\nalmost gave a certificate of good conduct to people whom he might have\r\nbeen heard referring to a few hours before in a far more antagonistic\r\nspirit than that displayed by those whom he so sharply contradicted.\r\n\r\nI remember one amusing instance of the idiosyncrasy referred to. There was\r\nin Johannesburg a man who, having arrived there with twenty-five pounds in\r\nhis pockets--as he liked to relate with evident pride in the fact--had, in\r\nthe course of two years, amassed together a fortune of two millions\r\nsterling. One day during dinner at Groote Schuur he enlarged upon the\r\nsubject with such offensiveness that an English lady, newly arrived in\r\nSouth Africa and not yet experienced in the things which at the time were\r\nbetter left unsaid, was so annoyed at his persistency that she interrupted\r\nthe speaker with the remark:\r\n\r\n\"Well, if I were you, I would not be so eager to let the world know that I\r\nhad made two millions out of twenty-five pounds. It sounds exactly like\r\nthe story of the man who says that in order to catch a train at six\r\no'clock in the morning he gets up at ten minutes to six. You know at once\r\nthat he cannot possibly have washed, whilst your story shows that you\r\ncould not possibly have been honest.\"\r\n\r\nI leave the reader to imagine the consternation produced among those\r\npresent by these words. But what were their feelings when they heard\r\nRhodes say in reply:\r\n\r\n\"Well, one does not always find water to wash in, and at Kimberley this\r\nhappened oftener than one imagines; as for being honest, who cares for\r\nhonesty nowadays?\"\r\n\r\n\"Those who have not lived in South Africa, Mr. Rhodes,\" was the retort\r\nwhich silenced the Colossus.\r\n\r\nThis man of the get-rich-quick variety was one of those who had mastered\r\nthe difficult operation of passing off to others the mines out of which he\r\nhad already extracted most of the gold, an occupation which, in the early\r\nJohannesburg days, had been a favourite one with many of the inhabitants\r\nof this wonderful town. One must not forget that as soon as the fame of\r\nthe gold fields of the Transvaal began to spread adventurers hastened\r\nthere, together with a few honest pioneers, desirous of making a fortune\r\nout of the riches of a soil which, especially in prospectuses lavishly\r\ndistributed on the London and Paris Stock Exchanges, was described as a\r\nmodern Golconda. Concessions were bought and sold, companies were formed\r\nwith a rapidity which savoured of the fabulous. Men made not only a\r\nliving, but also large profits, by reselling plots of ground which they\r\nhad bought but a few hours before, and one heard nothing but loud praises\r\nof this or that mine that could be had for a song, \"owing to family\r\ncircumstances\" or other reasons which obliged their owner to part with it.\r\n\r\nThe individual who had boasted of the intelligent manner with which he had\r\ntransformed his twenty-five pounds into two solid millions had, early in\r\nhis career, invested some of his capital in one of these mines. Its only\r\nmerit was its high-sounding name. He tried for some time without success\r\nto dispose of it. At last he happened to meet a Frenchman, newly arrived\r\nin Johannesburg, who wanted to acquire some mining property there with the\r\nview of forming a company. Our hero immediately offered his own. The\r\nFrenchman responded to the appeal, but expressed the desire to go down\r\nhimself into the shaft to examine the property and get some ore in order\r\nto test it before the purchase was completed. The condition was agreed to\r\nwith eagerness, and a few days later the victim and his executioner\r\nproceeded together to the mine. The Frenchman went down whilst Mr. X----\r\nremained above. He walked about with his hands in his pockets, smoking\r\ncigarettes, the ashes of which he let fall with an apparent negligence\r\ninto the baskets of ore which were being sent up by the Frenchman. When\r\nthe latter came up, rather hot and dusty, the baskets were taken to\r\nJohannesburg and carefully examined: the ore was found to contain a\r\nconsiderable quantity of gold. The mine was bought, and not one scrap of\r\ngold was ever found in it. Mr. X---- had provided himself with cigarettes\r\nmade for the purpose, which contained gold dust in lieu of tobacco, and\r\nthe ashes which he had dropped were in reality the precious metal, the\r\npresence of which was to persuade the unfortunate Frenchman that he was\r\nbuying a property of considerable value. He paid for it something like two\r\nhundred thousand pounds, whilst the fame of the man who had thus cleverly\r\ntricked him spread far and wide.\r\n\r\nThe most amusing part of the story consists in its _dénouement_. The duped\r\nFrenchman, though full of wrath, was, nevertheless, quite up to the game.\r\nHe kept silence, but proceeded to form his company as if nothing had been\r\nthe matter. When it was about to be constituted and registered, he asked\r\nMr. X---- to become one of its directors, a demand that the latter could\r\nnot very well refuse with decency. He therefore allowed his name to figure\r\namong those of the members of the board, and he used his best endeavours\r\nto push forward the shares of the concern of which he was pompously\r\ndescribed on the prospectus as having been once the happy owner. As his\r\nname was one to conjure with the scrip went up to unheard-of prices, when\r\nboth he and his supposed victim, the Frenchman, realised and retired from\r\nthe venture, the richer by several hundreds of thousands of pounds.\r\nHistory does not say what became of the shareholders. As for Mr. X----, he\r\nnow lives in Europe, and has still a reputation in South Africa.\r\n\r\nThis story is but one amongst hundreds, and it is little wonder that,\r\nsurrounded as he was with men who indulged in this charming pastime of\r\nalways trying to dupe their fellow creatures, Rhodes' moral sense relaxed.\r\nIt is only surprising that he kept about him so much that was good and\r\ngreat, and that he did not succumb altogether to the contamination which\r\naffected everything and everybody around him. Happily for him he cherished\r\nhis own ambitions, had his own dreams for companions, his absorption in\r\nthe great work he had undertaken; these things were his salvation.\r\nRhodesia became the principal field of Rhodes' activity, and the care with\r\nwhich he fostered its prosperity kept him too busy and interested to\r\ncontinue the quest for riches which had been his great, if not his\r\nprincipal, occupation during the first years of his stay in South Africa.\r\n\r\nAlthough Cecil Rhodes was so happily placed that he had no need to bother\r\nover wealth, he was not so aloof to the glamour of politics. He had always\r\nfelt the irk of his retirement after the Raid, and the hankering after a\r\nleading political position became more pronounced as the episode which\r\nshut the Parliamentary door behind him after he had passed through its\r\nportals faded in the mind of the people.\r\n\r\nIt was not surprising, therefore, to observe that politics once more took\r\nthe upper hand amidst his preoccupations. It was, though, politics\r\nconnected with the development of the country that bore his name more than\r\nwith the welfare of the Cape Colony or of the Transvaal. It was only\r\nduring the last two years of Rhodes' existence that his interest revived\r\nin the places connected with his first successes in life. Rhodes had been\r\nconvinced that a war with the Boers would last only a matter of a few\r\nweeks--three months, as he prophesied when it broke out--and he was\r\nequally sure, though for what reason it is difficult to guess, that the\r\nwar would restore him to his former position and power. The illusion\r\nlingered long enough to keep him in a state of excitement, during which,\r\ncarried along by his natural enthusiasm, he indulged in several\r\nunconsidered steps, and when at last his hope was dispelled he accused\r\neverybody of being the cause of his disappointment. Never for a moment\r\nwould he admit that he could have been mistaken, or that the war, which at\r\na certain moment his intervention might possibly have avoided, had been\r\nthe consequence of the mischievous act he had not prevented.\r\n\r\nWhen the Bloemfontein Conference failed Rhodes was not altogether\r\ndispleased. He had felt the affront of not being asked to attend; and,\r\nthough his common sense told him that it would have been altogether out of\r\nthe question for him to take part in it, as this would have been\r\nconsidered in the light of a personal insult by President Kruger, he would\r\nhave liked to have been consulted by Sir Alfred Milner, as well as by the\r\nEnglish Government, as to the course to be adopted during its\r\ndeliberations. He was fully persuaded in his own mind that Sir Alfred\r\nMilner, being still a new arrival in South Africa, had not been able to\r\ngrasp its complicated problems, and so had not adopted the best means to\r\nbaffle the intrigues of President Kruger and the diplomacy of his clever\r\ncolleague, President Steyn. At every tale which reached Cecil Rhodes\r\nconcerning the difficulties encountered by Sir Alfred, he declared that he\r\nwas \"glad to be out of this mess.\" Yet it was not difficult to see that he\r\npassionately regretted not being allowed to watch from a seat at the\r\ncouncil table the vicissitudes of this last attempt by conference to\r\nsmooth over difficulties arising from the recklessness displayed by people\r\nin arrogantly rushing matters that needed careful examination.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRESIDENT KRUGER]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE AFTERMATH OF THE RAID\r\n\r\n\r\nToward the close of the last chapter I referred to the Raid passing from\r\nthe forefront of public memory. But though, as a fact, it became blurred\r\nin the mind of the people, as a factor in South African history its\r\ninfluence by no means diminished. Indeed, the aftermath of the Raid\r\nassumed far greater proportions as time went on. It influenced so entirely\r\nthe further destinies of South Africa, and brought about such enmities and\r\nsuch bitterness along with it, that nothing short of a war could have\r\nwashed away its impressions. Up to that fatal adventure the Jingo English\r\nelements, always viewed with distrust and dislike in the Transvaal as well\r\nas at the Cape, had been more or less held back in their desire to gain an\r\nascendancy over the Dutch population, whilst the latter had accepted the\r\nJingo as a necessary evil devoid of real importance, and only annoying\r\nfrom time to time.\r\n\r\nAfter the Raid all the Jingoes who had hoped that its results would be to\r\ngive them greater facilities of enrichment considered themselves\r\npersonally aggrieved by its failure. They did just what Rhodes was always\r\ndoing. The Boers and President Kruger had acted correctly in this\r\nenterprise of Doctor Jameson, but the Jingoes made them responsible for\r\nthe results of its failure. They went about giving expression to feelings\r\nof the most violent hatred against the Boers, and railed at their\r\nwickedness in daring to stand up in defence of rights which the British\r\nGovernment had solemnly recognised. It became quite useless to tell those\r\nmisguided individuals that the Cabinet at Westminster had from the very\r\nfirst blamed Rhodes for his share in what the English Press, with but few\r\nexceptions, had declared to be an entirely disgraceful episode. They\r\npretended that people in London knew nothing about the true state of\r\naffairs in South Africa or the necessities of the country; that the\r\nBritish Government had always shown deplorable weakness in regard to the\r\ntreatment meted out to its subjects in the Colonies, and that both Rhodes\r\nand Jameson were heroes whose names deserved to be handed down to\r\nposterity for the services which they had rendered to their country.\r\n\r\nIt is true that these ardent Jingoes were but a small minority and that\r\nthe right-minded elements among the English Colonials universally blamed\r\nthe unwarranted attack that had been made against the independence of the\r\nTransvaal. But the truculent minority shouted loud enough to drown the\r\ncensure, and as, with a few notable exceptions, the South African Press\r\nwas under the influence of the magnates, it was not very easy to protest\r\nagainst the strange way in which the Raid was being excused. I am\r\npersuaded that, had the subject been allowed to drop, it would have died a\r\nnatural death, or at worst been considered as an historical blunder. But\r\nthe partisans of Rhodes, the friends of Jameson, and personages connected\r\nwith the leading financial powers did their best to keep the remembrance\r\nof the expedition which wrecked the political life of Rhodes fresh before\r\nthe public. The mere mention of it was soon sufficient to arouse a tempest\r\nof passions, especially among the Dutch party, and by and by the history\r\nof South Africa resolved itself into the Raid and its memories. You never\r\nheard people say, \"This happened at such a time\"; they merely declared,\r\n\"This happened before, or after, the Raid.\" It became a landmark for the\r\ninhabitants of Cape Town and of the Transvaal, and I could almost believe\r\nthat, in Kimberley at any rate, the very children in the schools were\r\ntaught to date their knowledge of English history from the time of the\r\nRaid.\r\n\r\nThe enemies of Cecil Rhodes, and their number was legion, always declared\r\nthat the reason why he had faced the music and braved public opinion in\r\nEngland lay in the fact that, for some reason or other, he was afraid of\r\nDoctor Jameson. I have referred already to this circumstance. Whilst\r\nrefusing to admit such a possibility, yet I must own that the influence,\r\nand even the authority exercised by the Doctor on his chief, had something\r\nuncanny about it. My own opinion has always been that Rhodes' attitude\r\narose principally from his conviction that Jameson was the only one who\r\nunderstood his constitution, the sole being capable of looking after his\r\nhealth. Curious as it may seem, I am sure the Colossus had an inordinate\r\nfear of death and of illness of any kind. He knew that his life was not a\r\nsound one, but he always rebelled against the idea that, like other\r\nmortals, he was subject to death. I feel persuaded that one of the reasons\r\nwhy he chose to be buried in the Matoppo Hills was that, in selecting this\r\nlonely spot, he felt that he would not often be called upon to see the\r\nplace where he would rest one day.\r\n\r\nThis dread of the unknown, so rare in people of his calibre, remained with\r\nhim until the end. It increased in acuteness as his health began to fail.\r\nThen, more than ever, did he entertain and plan new schemes, as if to\r\npersuade himself that he had unlimited time before him in which to execute\r\nthem. His flatterers knew how to play upon his weakness, and they never\r\nfailed to do so. Perhaps this foible explains the influence which Doctor\r\nJameson undoubtedly exercised upon the mind of Rhodes. He believed himself\r\nto be in safety whenever Jameson was about him. And so in a certain sense\r\nhe was, because, with all his faults, the Doctor had a real affection for\r\nthe man to whom he had been bound by so many ties ever since the days when\r\nat Kimberley they had worked side by side, building their fortunes and\r\ntheir careers.\r\n\r\nBy a curious freak of destiny, when the tide of events connected with the\r\nwar had given to the Progressive English party a clear majority in the\r\nCape Parliament, Jameson assumed its leadership as a matter of course,\r\nlargely because he was the political next-of-kin to Rhodes. The fact that\r\nat that time he lived at Groote Schuur added to his popularity, and he\r\ncontinued whilst there the traditional hospitality displayed during the\r\nlifetime of Rhodes. That he ultimately became Prime Minister was not\r\nsurprising; the office fell to his share as so many other good things had\r\nfallen before; and, having obtained this supreme triumph and enjoyed it\r\nfor a time, he was tactful enough to retire at precisely the right moment.\r\n\r\nThe Raid indirectly killed Rhodes and directly obliterated his political\r\nreputation. It lost him, too, the respect of all the men who could have\r\nhelped him to govern South Africa wisely and well. It deprived him of the\r\nexperience and popularity of Mr. Schreiner, Mr. Merriman, Mr. Sauer and\r\nother members of the Afrikander Bond who had once been upon terms of\r\nintimacy and affection with him.\r\n\r\nIt must never be forgotten that at one period of his history Rhodes was\r\nconsidered to be the best friend of the Dutch party; and, secondly, that\r\nhe had been the first to criticise the action of the British Government in\r\nregard to the Transvaal. At the very moment when the Raid was contemplated\r\nhe was making the most solemn assurances to his friends--as they then\r\nbelieved themselves to be--that he would never tolerate any attack against\r\nthe independence of the Boers. If his advice had been taken, Rhodes\r\nconsidered that the errors which culminated at Majuba with the defeat of\r\nthe British troops would have been avoided. He caused the same assurances\r\nto be conveyed to President Kruger, and this duplicity, which in anyone\r\nless compromised than he was in regard to the Dutch party might have been\r\nblamed, was in his case considered as something akin to high treason, and\r\nroused against him sentiments not only of hatred, but also of disgust.\r\nWhen later on, at the time of the Boer War, Rhodes made attempts to\r\ningratiate himself once more into the favour of the Dutch he failed to\r\nrealise that while there are cases when animosity can give way before\r\npolitical necessity, it is quite impossible in private to shake hands with\r\nan individual whom one despises. And that such persons as Mrs. van Koopman\r\nor Mr. Schreiner, for instance, despised Rhodes there can be no doubt.\r\n\r\nThey were wrong in doing so. Rhodes was essentially a man of moods, and\r\nalso an opportunist in his strange, blunt way. Had the Dutch rallied round\r\nhim during the last war it is certain that he would have given himself up\r\nbody and soul to the task of trying to smooth over the difficulties which\r\ngave such an obstinate character to the war. He would have induced the\r\nEnglish Government to grant to all rebel colonists who returned to their\r\nallegiance a generous pardon and reinstatement into their former rights.\r\n\r\nEven while the war lasted it is a fact that, in a certain sense, Rhodes'\r\nown party suspected him of betraying its interests. I feel almost sure\r\nthat Sir Alfred Milner did not trust him, but, nevertheless, he would have\r\nliked Rhodes as a coadjutor. If the two men were never on sincerely\r\ncordial terms with one another it was not the fault of the High\r\nCommissioner, who, with that honesty of which he always and upon every\r\noccasion gave proof, tried to secure the co-operation of the great South\r\nAfrican statesman in his difficult task. But Rhodes would not help Sir\r\nAlfred. But neither, too, would he help the Dutch unless they were willing\r\nto eat humble pie before him. In fact, it was this for which Rhodes had\r\nbeen waiting ever since the Raid. He wanted people to ask his forgiveness\r\nfor the faults he himself had committed. He would have liked Sir Alfred\r\nMilner to beg of him as a favour to take the direction of public affairs,\r\nand he would have desired the whole of the Dutch party to come down _in\r\ncorpore_ to Groote Schuur, to implore him to become their leader and to\r\nfight not only for them but also for the rights of President Kruger, whom\r\nhe professed to ridicule and despise, but to whom he had caused assurances\r\nof sympathy to be conveyed.\r\n\r\nDuring the first period of the war, and especially during the siege, Cecil\r\nRhodes was in Kimberley. He had gone with the secret hope that he might be\r\nable from that centre to retain a stronger hold on South African politics\r\nthan could have been the case at Groote Schuur, in which region the only\r\nauthority recognised by English and Dutch alike was that of Sir Alfred\r\nMilner. He waited for a sign telling him that his ambition was about to be\r\nrealised in some way or other--and waited in vain. It is indisputable that\r\nwhilst he was shut up in the Diamond City Rhodes entered into secret\r\nnegotiations with some of the Dutch leaders. This, though it might have\r\nbeen construed in the sense of treason against his own Motherland had it\r\nreached the knowledge of the extreme Jingo party, was in reality the\r\nsincere effort of a true patriot to put an end to a struggle which was\r\nthreatening to destroy the prosperity of a country for which he had\r\nlaboured for so many years.\r\n\r\nIn judging Rhodes one must not forget that though a leading personality in\r\nSouth Africa, and the chairman of a corporation which practically ruled\r\nthe whole of the Cape Colony and, in part, also the Transvaal, he was,\r\nafter all, at that time nothing but a private individual. He had the right\r\nto put his personal influence at the service of the State and of his\r\ncountry if he considered that by so doing he could bring to an end a war\r\nwhich threatened to bring destruction on a land that was just beginning to\r\nprogress toward civilisation. It must be remembered that his was the only\r\ngreat personality in South Africa capable of opposing President Kruger and\r\nthe other Dutch and Boer leaders. He was still popular among many\r\npeople--feared by some, worshipped by others. He could rally round him\r\nmany elements that would never coalesce with either Dutch or English\r\nunless he provided the impetus of his authority and approval. If only he\r\nhad spoken frankly to the Boer leaders whom he had caused to be\r\napproached, called them to his side instead of having messages conveyed to\r\nthem by people whom he could disavow later on and whom, in fact, he did\r\ndisavow; and if, on the other hand, Rhodes had placed himself at the\r\ndisposal of Sir Alfred Milner, and told him openly that he would try to\r\nsee what he could do to help him, the tenseness of the situation would\r\nalmost certainly have been eased.\r\n\r\nIn a position as intermediary between two adversaries who required his\r\nadvice and influence to smooth the way toward a settlement of the terrible\r\nSouth African question Rhodes could have done incalculable service and\r\nadded lustre to his name. But he did not, and it is not without interest\r\nto seek the reason why the Colossus was not courageous enough to embark\r\nupon such a course. Whether through fear of his actions being wrongly\r\ninterpreted, or else because he did not feel sure of his ground and was\r\napprehensive lest he might be induced to walk into a trap, Cecil Rhodes\r\nnever would pronounce himself upon one side or the other. He left to\r\nwell-wishers the task of reconciliation between himself and his enemies,\r\nor, if not that, at least the possibility for both once more to take\r\ncommon action for the solution of South African difficulties. The\r\nunfortunate side of the whole affair lay in the fact that the Boer and\r\nBond leaders each remained under the impression that in the Raid affair it\r\nwas against their particular body that Rhodes had sinned, that it was\r\ntheir cause which he had betrayed. Accordingly they expected him to\r\nrecognise this fact and to tell them of his regret.\r\n\r\nBut this was not Rhodes' way: on the contrary, he looked to his\r\nadversaries to consider that they had wronged him. Both parties adhered\r\nfirmly to their point of view; it was not an easy matter to persuade\r\neither of them to take the initiative. Each very well knew and felt it was\r\nan indispensable step, but each considered it should be taken by the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThis brings me to make a remark which probably has never yet found its way\r\ninto print, though some have spoken about it in South Africa. It is that\r\nCecil Rhodes, whilst being essentially an Empire Maker, was not an Empire\r\nRuler. His conceptions were far too vast to allow him to take into\r\nconsideration the smaller details of everyday life which, in the\r\nmanagement of the affairs of the world, obliges one to consider possible\r\nramifications of every great enterprise. Rhodes wanted simply to sweep\r\naway all obstacles without giving the slightest thought to the\r\nconsequences likely to follow on so offhand a manner of getting rid of\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this disregard of vital details, there was a tinge of\r\nselfishness in everything which Rhodes undertook and which gave a personal\r\naspect to matters which ought to have been looked upon purely from the\r\nobjective. The acquisition of Rhodesia, for instance, was considered by\r\nhim as having been accomplished for the aggrandisement of the Empire and\r\nalso for his own benefit. He sincerely believed that he had had nothing\r\nelse in his mind when he founded the Chartered Company, than the desire to\r\nconquer a new country and to give it to England; but he would certainly\r\nhave felt cruelly affronted if the British Government had ever taken its\r\nadministration into its own hands and not allowed Rhodes to do exactly\r\nwhat he pleased there. He loved to go to Buluwayo, and would spend weeks\r\nwatching all that was being done in the way of agriculture and mining. In\r\nparticular, he showed considerable interest in the natives.\r\n\r\nThe Colonial Office in London was treated by Cecil Rhodes with the utmost\r\ndisdain on the rare occasions when it tried to put in a word concerning\r\nthe establishment of British rule in the territories which he gloried in\r\nhaving presented to the Queen. It was sufficient to mention in his\r\npresence the possibility of the Charter being recalled to put Rhodes into\r\na passion. No king or tyrant of old, indeed, treated his subjects with the\r\nseverity which Rhodes showed in regard to the different civil officials\r\nand military defenders of the Rhodesia he loved so much and so unwisely.\r\n\r\nIt is curious that Rhodes never allowed speculation a free hand in\r\nRhodesia as he had done at Kimberley or at Johannesburg. He was most\r\ncareful that outsiders should not hear about what was going on, and took\r\nendless precautions not to expose the companies that worked the old\r\ndominions of poor King Lobengula, to the sharp criticism of the European\r\nStock Exchanges. Their shares remained in the hands of people on whose\r\ndiscretion Rhodes believed that he could rely, and no one ever heard of\r\ngambling in scrip exciting the minds of the inhabitants of Buluwayo or\r\nSalisbury to anything like the degree stocks in Transvaal concerns did.\r\n\r\nIn Rhodesia Rhodes believed himself on his own ground and free from the\r\ncriticisms which he guessed were constantly uttered in regard to him and\r\nto his conduct. In the new land which bore his name Rhodes was surrounded\r\nonly by dependants, whilst in Cape Colony he now and then came across\r\nsomeone who would tell him and, what was worse, who would make him feel\r\nthat, after all, he was not the only man in the world, and that he could\r\nnot always have everything his own way. Moreover, in Cape Town there was\r\nthe Governor, whose personality was more important than his own, and whom,\r\nwhether he liked it or not, he had to take into consideration, and to\r\nwhom, in a certain sense, he had to submit. And in Kimberley there was the\r\nDe Beers Board which, though composed of men who were entirely in\r\ndependence upon him and whose careers he had made, yet had to be\r\nconsulted. He could not entirely brush them aside, the less so that a\r\nwhole army of shareholders stood behind them who, from time to time, were\r\nimpudent enough to wish to see what was being done with their money.\r\n\r\nNothing in the way of hampering critics or circumscribing authorities\r\nexisted in Rhodesia. The Chartered Company, though administered by a\r\nBoard, was in reality left entirely in the hands and under the control of\r\nRhodes. Most of the directors were in England and came before public\r\nnotice only at the annual general meeting, which was always a success,\r\ninasmuch as no one there had ever ventured to criticise, otherwise than in\r\na mild way, the work of the men who were supposed to watch over the\r\ndevelopment of the resources of the country. Rhodes was master, and\r\nprobably his power would have even increased had he lived long enough to\r\nsee the completion of the Cape to Cairo Railway, which was his last hobby\r\nand the absorbing interest of the closing years of his life.\r\n\r\nThe Cape to Cairo Railway was one of those vast schemes that can be\r\nascribed to the same quality in his character as that which made him so\r\nessentially an Empire Maker. It was a project of world-wide importance,\r\nand destined to set the seal to the paramount influence of Great Britain\r\nover the whole of Africa. It was a work which, without Rhodes, would never\r\nhave been accomplished. He was right to feel proud of having conceived it;\r\nand England, too, ought to be proud of having counted among her sons a man\r\ncapable of starting such a vast enterprise and of going on with it despite\r\nthe violent opposition and the many misgivings with which it was received\r\nby the general public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nRHODES AND THE AFRIKANDER BOND\r\n\r\n\r\nTo return to the subject of the negotiations which undoubtedly took place\r\nbetween Rhodes and the leaders of the Afrikander Bond during the war, I\r\nmust say that, so far as I know, they can rank among the most\r\ndisinterested actions of his life. For once there was no personal interest\r\nor possible material gain connected with his desire to bring the Dutch\r\nelements in South Africa to look upon the situation from the purely\r\npatriotic point of view, as he did himself.\r\n\r\nIt would have been most certainly to the advantage of everybody if,\r\ninstead of persisting in a resistance which was bound to collapse, no\r\nmatter how successful it might appear to have been at its start, the\r\nBoers, together with the Dutch Afrikanders, had sent the olive branch to\r\nCape Town. There would then have been some hope of compromise or of coming\r\nto terms with England before being crushed by her armies. It would have\r\nbeen favourable to English interests also had the great bitterness, which\r\nrendered the war such a long and such a rabid one, not had time to spread\r\nall over the country. Rhodes' intervention, which Sir Alfred Milner could\r\nnot have refused had he offered it, backed by the Boers on one side and by\r\nthe English Progressive party in the Colony on the other, might have\r\nbrought about great results and saved many lives.\r\n\r\nNo blame, therefore, ought to attach to Cecil Rhodes for wishing to\r\npresent the Boer side of the case. It would, indeed, have been wiser on\r\nthe part of Mr. Hofmeyr and other Bond leaders to have forgotten the past\r\nand given a friendly hand to the one man capable of unravelling the\r\ntangled skein of affairs.\r\n\r\nAt that period, whilst the siege of Kimberley was in progress, it is\r\ncertain that serious consideration was given to this question of common\r\naction on the part of Rhodes and of the two men who practically held the\r\ndestinies of the Transvaal in their hands--de Wet and General Botha, with\r\nMr. Hofmeyr as representative of the Afrikander Bond at their back. Why it\r\nfailed would for ever remain a mystery if one did not remember that\r\neverywhere in South Africa lurked hidden motives of self-interest which\r\ninterfered with the best intentions. The fruits of the seed of distrust\r\nsown by the Raid were not easy to eradicate.\r\n\r\nPerhaps if Mr. Rhodes had stood alone the attempt might have met with more\r\nsuccess than was actually the case. But it was felt by all the leading men\r\nin the Transvaal that a peace concluded under his auspices would result in\r\nthe subjection of the Boers to the foreign and German-Jew millionaires.\r\nThis was the one thing they feared.\r\n\r\nThe Boers attributed to the millionaires of the Rand all the misfortunes\r\nwhich had fallen upon them, and consequently the magnates were bitterly\r\nhated by the Boers. And not without reason. No reasonable Boer would have\r\nseriously objected to a union with England, provided it had been effected\r\nunder conditions assuring them autonomy and a certain independence. But no\r\none wanted to have liberty and fortune left at the mercy of adventurers,\r\neven though some of them had risen to reputation and renown, obtained\r\ntitles, and bought their way into Society.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for him, Rhodes was supposed to represent the class of\r\npeople referred to, or, at any rate, to favour them. One thing is\r\ncertain--the great financial interests which Rhodes possessed in the Gold\r\nFields and other concerns of the same kind lent some credence to the idea.\r\nAll these circumstances prevented public opinion from expressing full\r\nconfidence in him, because no one could bring himself to believe what\r\nnevertheless would have come true.\r\n\r\nIn the question of restoring peace to South Africa Rhodes most certainly\r\nwould never have taken anyone's advice; he would have acted according to\r\nhis own impulse, and more so because Doctor Jameson was not with him\r\nduring the whole time Kimberley was besieged. Unfortunately for all the\r\nparties concerned, Rhodes let slip the opportunity to resume his former\r\nfriendship with Mr. Hofmeyr, the only man in South Africa whose\r\nintelligence could measure itself with his own. And in the absence of this\r\nfirst step from Rhodes, a false pride--which was wounded vanity more than\r\nanything else--prevented the Bond from seeking the help of Rhodes. This\r\nattitude on the part of each man would simply have been ridiculous under\r\nordinary circumstances, but at a time when such grave interests were at\r\nstake, and when the future of so many people was liable to be compromised,\r\nit became criminal.\r\n\r\nIn sharp contrast to it stood the conduct of Sir Alfred Milner, who was\r\nnever influenced by his personal feelings or by his vanity where the\r\ninterests of his country were engaged. During the few months which\r\npreceded the war he was the object of virulent hatred on the part of most\r\nof the white population of the Colony. When the first disillusions of the\r\nwar brought along with them their usual harvest of disappointments the\r\npersonality of the High Commissioner appeared at last in its true light,\r\nand one began to realise that here was a man who possessed a singularly\r\nclear view on matters of politics, and that all his actions were guided by\r\nsound principles. His quiet determination not to allow himself to be\r\ninfluenced by the gossip of Cape Town was also realised, and amid all the\r\nspite shown it is to his honour that, instead of throwing up the sponge,\r\nhe persevered, until at last he succeeded in the aim which he had kept\r\nbefore him from the day he had landed in Table Bay. He restored peace to\r\nthe dark continent where no one had welcomed him, but where everybody\r\nmourned his departure when he bade it good-bye after the most anxious\r\nyears he had ever known.\r\n\r\nWhen Sir Alfred accepted the post of Governor of the Cape Colony and\r\nEnglish High Commissioner in South Africa, he had intended to study most\r\ncarefully the local conditions of the new country whither fate and his\r\nduty were sending him, and then, after having gained the necessary\r\nexperience capable of guiding him in the different steps he aspired to\r\ntake, to proceed to the formidable task he had set for himself. His great\r\nobject was to bring about a reconciliation between the two great political\r\nparties in the Colony--the South African League, with Rhodes as President,\r\nand the Afrikander Bond, headed by Messrs. Hofmeyr (the one most in\r\npopular favour with the Boer farmers), Sauer and Schreiner.\r\n\r\nIn the gigantic task of welding together two materials which possessed\r\nlittle affinity and no love for each other, Sir Alfred was unable to be\r\nguided by his experience in the Motherland. In England a certain\r\nconstitutional policy was the basis of every party. At the Cape the\r\ndominating factors were personal feelings, personal hatreds and\r\naffections, while in the case of the League it was money and money alone.\r\nI do not mean that every member of the League had been bought by De Beers\r\nor the Chartered Company; but what I do maintain is that the majority of\r\nits members had some financial or material reason to enrol themselves.\r\n\r\nIn judging the politics of South Africa at the period of which I am\r\nwriting, one must not forget that the greater number of those who then\r\nconstituted the so-called Progressive party were men who had travelled to\r\nthe Cape through love of adventure and the desire to enrich themselves\r\nquickly. It was only the first comers who had seen their hopes realised.\r\nThose who came after them found things far more difficult, and had\r\nperforce to make the best of what their predecessors left. On the other\r\nhand, it was relatively easy for them to find employment in the service of\r\none or the other of the big companies that sprang up, and by whom most of\r\nthe mining and industrial concerns were owned.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HON. J.H. HOFMEYR]\r\n\r\nWhen the influence of the De Beers increased after its amalgamation with\r\nthe other diamond companies around Kimberley, and when Rhodes made up his\r\nmind that only a political career could help him to achieve his vast\r\nplans, he struck upon the thought of using the money and the influence\r\nwhich were at his disposal to transform De Beers into one of the most\r\nformidable political instruments the world had ever seen. He succeeded in\r\ndoing so in what would have been a wonderful manner if one did not\r\nremember the crowd of fortune-seeking men who were continually landing in\r\nSouth Africa. These soon found that it would advantage them to enrol under\r\nRhodes' banner, for he was no ordinary millionaire. Here stood a man who\r\nwas perpetually discovering new treasures, annexing new continents, and\r\nwho had always at his disposal profitable posts to scatter among his\r\nfollowers.\r\n\r\nThe reflex action upon Rhodes was that unconsciously he drifted into the\r\nconviction that every man could be bought, provided one knew what it was\r\nhe wanted. He understood perfectly well the art of speculating in his\r\nneighbours' weaknesses, and thus liked to invite certain people to make\r\nlong stays at his house, not because he liked them, but because he knew,\r\nif they did not, that they would soon discover that the mere fact of being\r\nthe guest of Mr. Rhodes procured for them the reputation of being in his\r\nconfidence. Being a guest at Groote Schuur endowed a man with a prestige\r\nsuch as no one who has not lived in South Africa can realise, and,\r\nfurthermore, enabled him to catch here and there scraps of news respecting\r\nthe money markets of the world, a proper understanding and use of which\r\ncould be of considerable financial value. A cup of tea at Groote Schuur\r\nwas sufficient to bring about more than one political conversion.\r\n\r\nOnce started the South African League soon became a power in the land, not\r\nso strong by any means as the Afrikander Bond, but far more influential in\r\nofficial, and especially in financial, circles. Created for the apparent\r\naim of supporting British government in Cape Colony, it found itself\r\nalmost from the very first in conflict with it, if not outwardly, at least\r\ntacitly. After his rupture with the Bond consequent upon the Raid, Rhodes\r\nbrought considerable energy to bear upon the development of the League. He\r\ncaused it to exercise all over the Colony an occult power which more than\r\nonce defied constituted authority, and proved a source of embarrassment to\r\nBritish representatives with greater frequency than they would have cared\r\nto own. Sir Alfred Milner, so far as I have been able to see, when taking\r\nthe reins, had not reckoned upon meeting with this kind of government\r\nwithin a government, and in doing so perhaps did not appreciate its\r\nextent. But from the earliest days of his administration it confronted\r\nhim, at first timidly, afterwards with persistence, and at last with such\r\ninsolence that he found himself compelled to see what he could do to\r\nreduce to impotence this organisation which sought to devour him.\r\n\r\nThe problem which a situation of the character described thrust upon Sir\r\nAlfred was easier to discuss than to solve. The League was a power so wide\r\nthat it was almost impossible to get rid of its influence in the country.\r\nIt was controlled by Rhodes, by De Beers, by the Chartered Company, by the\r\nmembers in both Houses who were affiliated to it, by all the great\r\nfinancial establishments throughout South Africa--with but a solitary\r\nexception--by the principal industrial and agricultural enterprises in the\r\ncountry. It comprised political men, landowners, doctors, merchants,\r\nship-owners, practically all the colonists in Rhodesia, and most of the\r\nEnglish residents of the Transvaal. It controlled elections, secured\r\nvotes, disposed of important posts, and when it advised the Governor the\r\nLegislature had to take its remarks into consideration whether or not it\r\napproved of them. Under the regime of the days when the League was formed\r\nit had been able to develop itself with great facility, the dangers which\r\nlurked behind its encroachment on the privileges of the Crown not being\r\nsuspected. But Sir Alfred Milner discovered the menace at once, and with\r\nthe quiet firmness and the tact which he always displayed in everything\r\nthat he undertook proceeded to cope with the organisation.\r\n\r\nSir Alfred soon found himself confronted by the irritation of Rhodes, who\r\nhad relied on his support for the schemes which he had nursed in regard to\r\nthe Transvaal. I must here explain the reason why Rhodes had thrown his\r\nglances toward the Rand. One must remember the peculiar conditions in\r\nwhich he was placed in being always surrounded by creatures whom he could\r\nonly keep attached to his person and to his ambition by satisfying their\r\ngreed for gold. When he had annexed Matabeleland it had been principally\r\nin the expectation that one would find there the rich gold-bearing strata\r\nsaid to exist in that region. Unfortunately, this hope proved a fallacious\r\none. Although thousands of pounds were spent in sinking and research, the\r\nresults obtained were of so insignificant a nature, and the quantity of\r\nore extracted so entirely insufficient to justify systematic exploitation,\r\nthat the adventurers had perforce to turn their attention toward other\r\nfields.\r\n\r\nIt was after this disillusion that the idea took hold of Rhodes, which he\r\ncommunicated to his friends, to acquire the gold fields of the Rand, and\r\nto transform the rich Transvaal into a region where the Chartered Company\r\nand the South African League would rule. Previous to this, if we are to\r\nbelieve President Kruger, Rhodes had tried to conclude an alliance with\r\nhim, and once, upon his return from Beira to Cape Town, had stopped at\r\nPretoria, where he paid a visit to the old Boer statesman.\r\n\r\nIt is quite likely that on this occasion Rhodes put in a word suggesting\r\nthat it would be an advantage to the Transvaal to become possessed of an\r\noutlet on the sea-board, but I hardly think that Kruger wrote the truth in\r\nhis memoirs in stating that when mentioning Delagoa Bay Rhodes used the\r\nwords, \"We must simply take it,\" thus associating himself with Kruger.\r\nCecil Rhodes was far too cute to do any such tiling, knowing that it would\r\nbe interpreted in a sense inimical to his plans. But I should not be\r\nsurprised if, when the President remarked that Delagoa was Portuguese, he\r\nhad replied, \"It does not matter, and you must simply take it.\" This would\r\nhave been far more to the point, as it would have hinted to those who knew\r\nhow to read between the lines that England, which Rhodes was persuaded was\r\nincarnated in himself, would not mind if the Transvaal did lay hands on\r\nDelagoa Bay. Such an act would furnish the British Government with a\r\npretext for dabbling to some effect in the affairs of the Transvaal\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\nSuch a move as this would have been just one of these things which Rhodes\r\nwas fond of doing. He felt sometimes a kind of malicious pleasure in\r\nwhispering to others the very things likely to get them into trouble\r\nshould they be so foolish as to do them. In the case of President Kruger,\r\nhowever, he had to deal with a mind which, though uncouth, yet possessed\r\nall the \"slimness\" of which so many examples are to be found in South\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\nKruger wrote, \"Rhodes represented capital, no matter how base and\r\ncontemptible, and whether by lying, bribery or treachery, all and every\r\nmeans were welcome to him if they led to the attainment of his ambitious\r\ndesires.\" But Oom Paul was absolutely wrong in thinking that it was the\r\npersonage he was thus describing who practised all these abominations. He\r\nought to have remembered that it was his name only which was associated\r\nwith all these basenesses, and the man himself, if left to his better\r\nself, would never have condescended to the many acts of doubtful morality\r\nwith which his memory will remain associated in history.\r\n\r\nI am firmly convinced that on his own impulse he would never, for\r\ninstance, have ventured on the Raid. But, unhappily, his habit, when\r\nsomething \"not quite\" was mentioned to him, was to say nothing and to\r\ntrust to his good luck to avoid unpleasant consequences arising out of his\r\nsilence. Had he ventured to oppose the plans of his confederates they\r\nwould have immediately turned upon him, and ... There were, perhaps, past\r\nfacts which he did not wish the world to remember. His frequent fits of\r\nraging temper arose from this irksome feeling, and was his way--a futile\r\nway--of revenging himself on his jailors for the durance in which they\r\nkept him. The man who believed himself to be omnipotent in South Africa,\r\nand who was considered so powerful by the world at large, was in reality\r\nin the hands of the very organisations he had helped to build.\r\n\r\nIt was not Cecil John Rhodes' will which was paramount in the South\r\nAfrican League. Kruger spoke absolutely the truth when he asserted that it\r\nwas essential \"to know something about the Chartered Company before it was\r\npossible to realise the true perspective of the history of South Africa\r\nduring the closing years of the last century.\" Another of Kruger's\r\nsweeping assertions--and one which he never backed by anything\r\ntangible--was when he further wrote that Rhodes was \"one of the most\r\nunscrupulous characters that ever existed, whose motto was 'the end\r\njustifies the means,' a motto that contains a creed which represents the\r\nwhole man.\" Rhodes by nature was not half so unscrupulous as Kruger\r\nhimself, but he was surrounded by unscrupulous people, whom he was too\r\nindolent to repulse. He was constantly paying the price of his former\r\nfaults and errors in allowing his name to serve as a shield for the\r\nambitions of those who were in no way worthy of him and who constantly\r\nabused his confidence.\r\n\r\nThe habit became ingrained in the nature of Cecil Rhodes of always doing\r\nwhat he chose without regard to the feelings and sentiments of others. It\r\npersisted during the whole of the war, and would probably have proved a\r\nserious impediment to the conclusion of peace had he lived until it became\r\naccomplished. This characteristic led him, after all his intrigues with\r\nthe Dutch party and the Bond, to throw himself once more into the arms of\r\nthe English Progressive party and to start a campaign of his own against\r\nthe rebel Colonials and the Dutch inhabitants of the Transvaal.\r\n\r\nWhile the siege of Kimberley lasted, even while he was seeking to become\r\nreconciled to the British element, Rhodes asserted himself in a strongly\r\noffensive manner. He sent to Sir Alfred Milner in Cape Town reports of his\r\nown as to the military authorities and dispositions, couched in such\r\nalarming tones that the High Commissioner became most uneasy concerning\r\nthe possible fate of the Diamond City. These reports accused the officers\r\nin charge of the town of failing in the performance of their duties, and\r\nshowing symptoms of abject fear in regard to the besieging Boer army. It\r\nwas only after an explanation from Sir Redvers Buller, and after the\r\nlatter had communicated to him the letters which he himself had received\r\nfrom Colonel Kekewich, the commander of the troops to whom had been\r\nentrusted the defence of Kimberley, that Sir Alfred was reassured.\r\n\r\nThe fact was that Rhodes became very impatient to find that his movements\r\nwere watched by the military authorities, and that sometimes even the\r\norders which he gave for what he considered the greater security of the\r\ntown, and gave with the superb assurance which distinguished him, were\r\ncancelled by the responsible officials. Disgraceful scenes followed.\r\nRhodes was accused of wishing to come to an arrangement with Cronje, who\r\nwas in charge of the besieging troops, in order to bring the war to an end\r\nby his own efforts.\r\n\r\nI never have been able to ascertain how much of real truth, if any, was in\r\nthe various accusations made against Cecil Rhodes by the English General\r\nOfficers, but they were embodied in the message which was alleged to have\r\nbeen flashed across to Kimberley after the battle of Modder River by Lord\r\nMethuen, but which was supposed by those whom it concerned to have been\r\ninspired by the Commander-in-Chief:\r\n\r\n\"Tell Mr. Rhodes,\" the heliograph ran, \"that on my entry into Kimberley he\r\nand his friends must take their immediate departure.\"\r\n\r\nTwo years later, in November, 1902, Sir Redvers Buller, when speaking at\r\nthe annual dinner of the Devonians in London, remarked that he must\r\nprotest against the rumours which, during the siege of Kimberley, had been\r\nspread by some of its residents that the Imperial authorities had been in\r\na perpetual state of \"funk.\" The allusion was understood to refer to Mr.\r\nRhodes by his partisans, who protested against the speech. Rhodes, indeed,\r\nduring his whole life was never in greater disfavour with the English\r\nGovernment than after the siege of Kimberley; perhaps because he had\r\nalways accused Whitehall of not understanding the real state of things in\r\nSouth Africa. The result of that imperative telegram, and Rhodes' belief\r\nas to its source, was bitter hatred against Sir Redvers Buller. It soon\r\nfound expression in vindictive attacks by the whole Rhodesian Press\r\nagainst the strategy, the abilities, and even the personal honesty of Sir\r\nRedvers Buller.\r\n\r\nWhether Rhodes, upon his arrival in London, attempted to hurt the General\r\nI do not know, but it could be always taken for granted that Rhodes could\r\nbe a very bad enemy when he chose.\r\n\r\nUpon his return to Groote Schuur he seemed more dissatisfied than ever\r\nwith the Home Government. He was loud in his denunciations and unceasing\r\nin his criticisms. Sir Alfred, however, like the wise man he was,\r\npreferred to ignore these pinpricks, and invariably treated Rhodes with\r\nthe utmost courtesy and attention. He always showed himself glad to listen\r\nto Rhodes and to discuss with him points which the Colossus thought it\r\nworth while to talk over. At that time Rhodes was in the most equivocal\r\nposition he had ever been in his life. He could not return to Kimberley;\r\nhe did not care to go to Rhodesia; and in Cape Colony he was always\r\nrestive.\r\n\r\nAt this period all kinds of discussions used to take place concerning the\r\nultimate results of the war and the influence which it would have on the\r\nfuture development of affairs in the Transvaal. The financiers began to\r\nrealise that after the British flag had once been raised at Pretoria they\r\nwould not have such a good time of it as they had hoped at first, and now,\r\nhaving done their best to hurry on the war, regretted it more than anybody\r\nelse. The fact was that everybody in South Africa, with the exception of\r\nthe Boers themselves, who knew very well their own resources, had believed\r\nthat the war would be over in three months, and that the Transvaal would\r\nbe transferred into a Crown Colony where adventurers and gold-seekers\r\nwould have a fine time.\r\n\r\nRhodes himself had more than once expressed his conviction that the\r\ndestruction of the Boers would not take more than three months at the\r\nmost, and this assurance was accepted as gospel by most of the financiers\r\nof Johannesburg. An exception was Mr. F. Eckstein, the general manager and\r\npartner in the concern of Wernher, Beit & Co., and one of the ablest\r\nfinanciers in that city. From the first he was quite pessimistic in regard\r\nto the length of time the war would take.\r\n\r\nAs the war dragged on without there seeming any chance of its being\r\nbrought to a rapid conclusion, it became evident that England, after all\r\nthe sacrifices which she was making, would never consent to leave the\r\nleaders of the movement--the ostensible object of which had been to grant\r\nto the Uitlanders certain privileges to which they had no right--as sole\r\nand absolute masters of the situation. In fact, the difficulties of the\r\nwar made it evident that, once peace was proclaimed, public opinion at\r\nhome would demand that the Transvaal, together with the Orange Free State,\r\nshould be annexed to the British Empire in view of a future federation of\r\nthe whole of South Africa, about which the English Press was already\r\nbeginning to speak.\r\n\r\nThat South Africa should not remain a sphere of exploitation sent shivers\r\ndown the spines of the financiers. The South African League was observed\r\nto become quite active in discovering rebels. Their zeal in this direction\r\nwas felt all over Cape Colony. Their aim was to reduce the register in\r\norder to bring about a considerable falling off of voters for the\r\nAfrikander Bond, and thereby substantially influence the results of the\r\nnext election to the Cape Parliament.\r\n\r\nAt this period certain overtures were made once again to the Bond party.\r\nThey proceeded apparently from men supposed to act on their own\r\ninitiative, but who were known to be in favour at Groote Schuur. These\r\nadvances met with no response, but when the rumour that they had been made\r\nspread among the public owing to an indiscretion, Rhodes hastened to deny\r\nthat he had been a party to the plan--as was his wont when he failed to\r\nachieve. All the same, it is a fact that members of the House of Assembly\r\nbelonging to the Afrikander party visited Groote Schuur in the course of\r\nthat last winter which Rhodes spent there, and were warmly welcomed.\r\nRhodes showed himself unusually gracious. He hoped these forerunners would\r\nrally his former friends to his side once more. But Rhodes was expecting\r\ntoo much, considering ail the circumstances. Faithful to his usual\r\ntactics, even whilst his Afrikander guests were being persuaded to lend\r\nthemselves to an intrigue from which they had hoped to win something,\r\nRhodes was making himself responsible for another step likely to render\r\nthe always strong hatred even more acute than ever. More than that, he was\r\nadvocating, through certain underground channels, the suspension of the\r\nConstitution in Cape Colony.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE RT. HON. SIR W.F. HELY-HUTCHINSON]\r\n\r\nThe particulars of this incident were only disclosed after the war was\r\nover. The whole thing was thrashed out in Parliament and its details\r\ncommunicated to the public by Mr. David de Waal, one of the truest friends\r\nMr. Rhodes ever had. The discussion took place after Sir Alfred Milner had\r\nbeen transferred to Johannesburg and Sir Walter Hely-Hutchinson had taken\r\nhis place in Cape Town. The South African League had become more active\r\nthan ever, and was using all its influence to secure a majority for its\r\nmembers at the next general election. The Bond, on its side, had numerous\r\nadherents up country, and the stout Dutch farmers had remained faithful to\r\ntheir old allegiance, so there was no hope that they would be induced,\r\neven through the influence of money, to give their votes to the\r\nProgressives. The only things which remained were: a redistribution of\r\nseats, then a clearing out of the register, and, lastly, a suspension of\r\nthe Constitution, which would have allowed the Governor a \"free\" hand in\r\nplacing certain measures on the statute book. The most influential members\r\namong the executive of the South African League met at Cotswold Chambers,\r\nand Rhodes, who was present, drew up a petition which was to be presented\r\nto the Prime Minister. Sir Gordon Sprigg, who filled that office, was a\r\nman who, with all his defects, was absolutely incapable of lending himself\r\nto any mean trick in order to remain in power. When Sir Gordon became\r\nacquainted with the demands of the League he refused absolutely to take a\r\npart in what he maintained would have been an everlasting blot on the\r\nreputation of the Government.\r\n\r\nAfter Rhodes' death, when the question of the suspension of the\r\nConstitution was raised by the Progressives in the House of Assembly, it\r\nwas discussed in all its details, and it was proved that the South African\r\nLeague, in trying throughout the country to obtain signatures to a monster\r\npetition on the matter, had resorted to some more than singular means to\r\nobtain these signatures. Mr. Sauer, who was the leader of the Bond party\r\nin the Chamber, revealed how the League had employed agents to induce\r\nwomen and sometimes young children to sign the petition, and that at the\r\ncamp near Sea Point, a suburb of Cape Town, where soldiers were stationed\r\nprevious to their departure for England, these same agents were engaged in\r\ngetting them to sign it before they left under the inducement of a fixed\r\nsalary up to a certain amount and a large percentage after it had been\r\nexceeded, according to the number of the names obtained in this way. When\r\ntrustworthy people of unimpeachable character wrote to the papers\r\ndenouncing this manoeuvre the subsidised papers in Cape Town, and the\r\nRhodesian Press, refused to publish the affidavits sworn on the subject,\r\nbut wrote columns of calumnies about the Dutch Colonials, and, as a\r\nfinishing stroke, clamoured for the suspension of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe speech of Mr. Sauer gave rise to a heated debate, during which the\r\nProgressive members indignantly denied his assertions. Then stepped in Mr.\r\nDavid de Waal, that friend of Rhodes to whom I have already referred. He\r\nrose to bring his testimony to the facts revealed by Mr. Sauer, who was\r\nundoubtedly the most able leader which the Afrikander party possessed,\r\nwith the exception, perhaps, of Mr. Merriman.\r\n\r\n\"In February, 1902,\" he said, \"there was a meeting in Cotswold Chambers\r\nconsisting of the twenty-two members of the House of Assembly who went by\r\nthe name of 'Rhodes' group.' It was at first discussed and ultimately\r\ndecided to wait on the Prime Minister and to interview him concerning the\r\nexpenditure of the war, which had reached the sum of £200,000 monthly.\r\nThen, after some further discussion, we came to the conclusion to meet\r\nonce more. This was done on February 17th. You must remember that war was\r\nstill raging at the time. At this second meeting it was agreed to\r\nformulate a scheme to be submitted to the Government which proposed the\r\nsuspension of the Constitution in regard to five clauses. The first was to\r\nbe this very suspension, then a new registration of voters, a\r\nredistribution of seats, the indemnity to be awarded to the faithful\r\nEnglish Colonials, and, finally, the reestablishment of the Constitution.\r\nAs to this last I must make a statement, and that is, that if I had known\r\nthat it was meant to withdraw the Constitution for more than one month I\r\nwould have objected to it, but I was told that it would be only a matter\r\nof a few days.\"\r\n\r\nAt this point Mr. de Waal was interrupted by a Progressive member, who\r\nexclaimed that Dr. Jameson had denied that such a thing had ever been said\r\nor mentioned.\r\n\r\n\"I know he has done so,\" replied Mr. de Waal, \"but I will make a\r\ndeclaration on my oath. A committee was then appointed,\" he went on,\r\n\"which waited on the Prime Minister and presented to him this very same\r\npetition. Sir Gordon Sprigg, however, said that he would not be ruled by\r\nanyone, because they had a responsible Government. The Committee reported,\r\nwhen it returned, that the Prime Minister was opposed to any movement\r\nstarted on the basis of the petition which they had presented to him, and\r\nthat he would not move an inch from his declaration, saying energetically,\r\n'Never! I shall never do it!' Sir Gordon Sprigg had further pointed out\r\nthat the result of such a step would be that the Cape would become a Crown\r\nColony and would find itself in the same position as Rhodesia.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps this was what Rhodes and the South African League had wished, but\r\nthe publication of the details connected with this incident, especially\r\nproceeding from a man who had never made a secret of the ties which had\r\nbound him to Rhodes, and who, among the latter's Dutch friends, had been\r\nthe only one who had never failed him, drove the first nail into the\r\ncoffin of Rhodesian politics.\r\n\r\nIt was common knowledge that de Waal had steadfastly stood by Rhodes even\r\nduring the terrible time of the Raid. Moreover, he was a man of high\r\nintegrity, who alone among those who had attached themselves to the\r\ndestinies of the Empire Maker had never taken part in the financial\r\nschemes of a doubtful nature which marked the wonderful career of Rhodes.\r\nThis declaration opened the eyes of many persons who, to that day, had\r\ndenied the political intrigues which had been going on at Cotswold\r\nChambers. Afterwards it became relatively easy for Sir Alfred Milner to\r\nclear the atmosphere in South Africa and to establish public life on\r\nsounder principles than the pure love of gain. It cannot be sufficiently\r\nregretted that he should not have done so before Rhodes' death and thus\r\nhave given Rhodes--and, incidentally, the country for which Rhodes had\r\ndone so much in the way of material development--the opportunity to shake\r\noff his parasites and become a real factor in solidifying the great area\r\nin which he was such an outstanding personality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE INFLUENCE OF SIR ALFRED MILNER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe occult power exercised by the League on the inner politics of South\r\nAfrica could not fail to impress Sir Alfred Milner most unpleasantly.\r\nFrank himself, it must have often been absolutely repulsive to him to have\r\nto do with people whom he feared to trust and who believed that they could\r\nbring into political life the laxities of the mining camp. Though not\r\naware of it, even before he landed in Cape Town the Progressives had made\r\nup their minds to represent him as determined to sweep the Dutch off the\r\nface of the earth.\r\n\r\nBelieving Sir Alfred to be the confederate of Rhodes, the Boers, too,\r\nwould have nothing to do with him. Whilst the Bloemfontein Conference was\r\ngoing on President Kruger, as well as the leaders of the Afrikander Bond,\r\nwere overwhelmed with covert warnings to distrust the High Commissioner.\r\nWhence they emanated is not a matter of much doubt. Sir Alfred was accused\r\nof wanting to lay a trap for the Boer plenipotentiaries, who were told to\r\nbeware of him as an accomplice of Mr. Joseph Chamberlain, whose very name\r\nproduced at Pretoria the same effect as a red rag upon a bull. Under these\r\ncircumstances the Conference was bound to fail, and the High Commissioner\r\nreturned to Cape Town, very decidedly a sadder and most certainly a wiser\r\nman.\r\n\r\nNow that years have passed since the Boer War it is possible to secure a\r\nbetter perspective, in the light of which one can question whether it\r\nwould have been possible to avoid the conflict by an arrangement of some\r\nkind with the Boer Republics, Personally, I believe that an understanding\r\nwas not out of the question if the strong financial interests had not\r\nopposed its accomplishment; but at the same time a patched up affair would\r\nnot have been a happy event for either South Africa or for England. It\r\nwould have left matters in almost the same condition as they had been\r\nbefore, and the millionaires, who were the real masters on the Rand, would\r\nhave found a dozen pretexts to provoke a new quarrel with the Transvaal\r\nGovernment. Had the Boer Executive attempted to do away with the power of\r\nthe concerns which ruled the gold mines and diamond fields, it would have\r\ncourted a resistance with which it would have been next to impossible to\r\ndeal. The war would still have taken place, but it might have occurred at\r\na far less favourable moment. No arrangement with President Kruger, even\r\none most propitious to British interests, could have done away with the\r\ncorruption and the bribery which, from the first moment of the discovery\r\nof the gold fields, invaded that portion of South Africa, and this\r\ncorruption would always have stood in the way of the establishment of the\r\nSouth African Union.\r\n\r\nSir Alfred Milner knew all this very well, and probably had an inward\r\nconviction, notwithstanding his efforts to prevent the war, that a\r\nconflict was the only means of breaking these chains of gold which\r\nshackled the wheels of progress. At so critical a time the support of\r\nRhodes and his party would have been invaluable. And Sir Alfred would have\r\nwelcomed it. Cecil Rhodes, of course, had declared himself officially in\r\naccord with the High Commissioner, and even praised him to a degree of\r\nfulsomeness. But the ulterior motive was simply to excite the Dutch party\r\nagainst him. The reputation of Sir Alfred Milner as a statesman and as a\r\npolitician was constantly challenged by the very people who ought to have\r\ndefended it. Rhodes himself had been persuaded that the Governor harboured\r\nthe most sinister designs against his person. The innuendo was one of the\r\nmost heinous untruths ever invented by his crowd of sycophants.\r\n\r\nAn opportunity came my way, by which I was able to convince myself how\r\nfalse was the belief nourished by Rhodes against Milner. During the course\r\nof a conversation with Sir Alfred, I boldly asked him whether he was\r\nreally such an enemy of Rhodes as represented. I was surprised by the\r\nmoderate tone in which he replied to my, after all, impertinent question.\r\nThe remarks which we then exchanged filled me with the greatest admiration\r\nfor the man who so nobly, and so worthily, upheld British prestige in\r\nSouth Africa under the most trying circumstances. Milner was an entirely\r\nhonest man--the rarest thing in the whole of Cape Town at that anxious\r\nperiod--and after one had had the advantage of discussing with him the\r\npolitical situation, one could only be filled with profound respect for\r\nhim and for his opinions, actions and conduct. Far from working against\r\nRhodes, as Sir Alfred had been represented to me as doing, I convinced\r\nmyself that he was keenly anxious to be on good and, what is more\r\nimportant, on sincere terms with him. Sir Alfred had not the slightest\r\nfeeling of animosity against the Dutch. On the contrary, he would have\r\nliked them to become persuaded of his desire to protect them against\r\npossible aggression by the Jingoes, whose offensive conduct none more than\r\nhimself assessed at its true value.\r\n\r\nBut what was the real situation? He found his every action misconstrued;\r\nwhatever he did was interpreted in a wrong sense, and those who should\r\nhave shared his aims were plotting against him. The position was truly\r\ntragic from whatever side it was viewed, and a weaker or less honest man\r\nwould assuredly have given up the struggle.\r\n\r\nA few days after my conversation with Sir Alfred Milner, which took place\r\nduring the course of a dinner at Government House, I took opportunity to\r\nmention it to Rhodes. I tried to clear his mind of the suspicions that I\r\nknew he entertained in regard to the High Commissioner. Cecil Rhodes\r\nlistened to me with attention, then asked me in that sarcastic tone of\r\nhis, which was so intensely disagreeable and offensive, whether I was in\r\nlove with Sir Alfred, as I had so suddenly become his champion. Then he\r\nended, \"You are trying to make me believe the impossible.\" I did not allow\r\nhim, however, to ruffle me, as evidently was his desire, but replied that\r\nwhen one came to know better those whom one had only met occasionally,\r\nwithout ever having talked with them seriously, it was natural to amend\r\none's opinion accordingly. I told him, too, that my earlier\r\nmisapprehension had been intensified by a certain lady who posed as\r\nRhodes' greatest friend, and who had been loud in her denunciations of the\r\nHigh Commissioner, long before I had ever met him. But now, I added, I had\r\ncome to the conclusion that Sir Alfred had been terribly maligned.\r\n\r\nAt this point Rhodes interrupted me with the remark: \"So you think that he\r\nis a paragon. Well, I won't contradict you, and, besides, you know that I\r\nhave always defended him; but still, with all his virtues, he has not yet\r\nfound out what he ought to do with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"What can one do with you, Mr. Rhodes?\" I asked with a smile.\r\n\r\n\"Leave me alone,\" was the characteristic reply, in a tone which was\r\nsufficient for me to follow the advice, as it meant that the man was\r\ngetting restive and might at any moment break out into one of those fits\r\nof rage which he so often used as a means to bring to an end a\r\nconversation in which he felt that he might not come out as victor.\r\n\r\nA few days later a rabid Rhodesian who happened to be staying at Groote\r\nSchuur approached me. \"You have been trying to convert Mr. Rhodes to Sir\r\nAlfred,\" he remarked.\r\n\r\n\"I have done nothing of the kind,\" I said. \"I am not a preacher, but I\r\nhave been telling Mr. Rhodes that he was mistaken if he thought that he\r\nhad an enemy in the High Commissioner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Had you any reason to suppose that he considered him one?\" was the\r\nunexpected question.\r\n\r\n\"Well, from what I have seen it seemed to me that you have all been doing\r\nyour best to persuade him that such was the case,\" I retorted, \"and why\r\nyou should have done so passes my comprehension.\"\r\n\r\nThe conversation dropped, but the incident confirmed me in my opinion that\r\nstrong forces were at work to sow enmity between Rhodes and Sir Alfred\r\nMilner for fear the influence of the High Commissioner might bring Rhodes\r\nto look at things differently. As things stood at the moment, Rhodes was\r\npersuaded that the High Commissioner hated him, was jealous of him, wanted\r\nhim out of his path, and never meant to allow him under any circumstances\r\nwhatever to have any say in the settlement of South African affairs. This\r\nconviction, which was carefully nourished from the outside, evoked in his\r\nmind an absurd and silly rage to which no man of common sense, unblinded\r\nby vanity, could have fallen victim. I would not be so foolish as to deny\r\nto the famous Life Governor of De Beers either abundant common sense or\r\noutstanding intelligence, but here was a man gifted with genius who, under\r\nthe impulse of passion, could act and speak like a child.\r\n\r\nRhodes looked upon the High Commissioner as a nuisance unfortunately not\r\nto be set aside. What exasperated him, especially in regard to the High\r\nCommissioner, was the fact that he knew quite well that Sir Alfred Milner\r\ncould assume the responsibility for concluding peace when that time\r\narrived. Rhodes always hoped that his personal influence on the English,\r\nas well as among the Bond party, would enable him to persuade the leaders\r\nof the rebel movement in Cape Colony to lay down their arms and to leave\r\ntheir interests in his hands. Should such a thing have happened, Rhodes\r\nthought that such a success as this would efface the bad impression left\r\nby the Raid. He grudgingly admitted that that wild adventure had not\r\npleased people, but he always refused to acknowledge that it was the one\r\ngreat and unredeemable mistake of his life. I remember once having quoted\r\nto him the old French motto which in the Middle Ages was the creed of\r\nevery true knight:\r\n\r\n                   \"Mon âme à Dieu,\r\n                    Mon bras au roi,\r\n                    Mon coeur aux dames,\r\n                    L'honneur à moi!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, yes! In those times one could still think about such things,\" he\r\nsimply remarked, which proved to me that he had no comprehension of the\r\nreal sense of the beautiful words. The higher attributes of mind did not\r\ntrouble him either in the hours of his greatest triumphs or in the moments\r\nwhen Fortune ceased to smile upon him. He thought he had something far\r\nbetter: ambition, love of domination, the desire to eclipse everybody and\r\neverything around him. I do not mention money, because Rhodes did not care\r\nfor money intrinsically.\r\n\r\nYet the man was great in spite of all his defects. Particularly in the\r\nrein he gave to his thoughts during nights spent in the solitude of the\r\nkarroo, when the stars were almost the only things which he could look\r\nupon, their immensity the only companion worthy of himself. One could\r\nalmost believe Cecil Rhodes was possessed of a dual personality. At one\r\nmoment he lived in the skies in regard to his own future prospects and the\r\ngreat deeds he wished to perform, about which he never ceased to think.\r\nThe next he was on this earth, dabbling in the meannesses of humanity,\r\ntaking a vicious pleasure in noticing the evil about him and too\r\nfrequently succeeding, somehow, in wounding the feelings of those who\r\nliked him best, and then wondering how it happened that he had so few\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nOn account of these characteristics, notwithstanding all his wonderful\r\nfaculties, Cecil Rhodes will never remain an historical figure like the\r\nCount of Egmont during the Revolt of the Netherlands, or Mirabeau at the\r\ntime of the French Revolution. Undoubtedly he achieved great things, but\r\nnothing truly beautiful. I do not think that even the warmest of his\r\nadmirers can ever say that the organising and amalgamation of De Beers or\r\nthe conquest of Matabeleland had anything beautiful about them. Still,\r\nthey were triumphs which no one except himself could have achieved. He\r\nundoubtedly erected an edifice the like of which had never been seen in\r\nmodern times, and he opened to the ambitions and to the greed of the world\r\nnew prospects, new sources of riches, which caused very many to look upon\r\nhim as truly the god of material success.\r\n\r\nRhodes can be said to have revolutionised Society by bringing to the\r\nsocial horizon people who, but for the riches he placed within reach of\r\ntheir grasping fingers, would never have been able to emerge from their\r\nuncultured obscurity.\r\n\r\nPeople have said to me, \"How generous was Rhodes!\" Yes, but always with a\r\nshade of disdain in the giving which hurt the recipients of his charity.\r\nOne of the legends in the Cape is that half those whom Rhodes helped had\r\nbeen his victims at one time or the other.\r\n\r\nIt was no wonder that Cecil Rhodes was an embittered man when one reflects\r\nhow many curses must have been showered upon his head. The conquest of\r\nMatabeleland had not gone by without evoking terrible enmities; and the\r\namalgamation of De Beers, in consequence of which so many people who had\r\nspent thousands of pounds in acquiring plots of ground where they had\r\nhoped to find diamonds, and who had later to part from them for a mere\r\nsong, were among the things never forgiven him by those whom the\r\nspeculations had ruined. Later on came the famous Bill which he caused to\r\nbe adopted in both Houses of Legislature concerning the illicit buying of\r\ndiamonds, the I.D.B. Act.\r\n\r\nThe I.D.B. enactment destroyed one of the fundamental principles in\r\nBritish legislature which always supposes a man to be innocent until he\r\nhas been proved guilty. It practically put the whole of Cape Colony under\r\nthe thumb of De Beers. The statute was not wisely framed. It could be\r\ninvoked to remove persons whose presence in Kimberley was inconvenient.\r\nTherefore the I.D.B. Act drew on the head of Rhodes and of his colleagues\r\ntorrents of abuse. It is, unfortunately, certain that cases happened where\r\ndiamonds were hidden surreptitiously among the effects of certain persons\r\nwho had had the imprudence to say too loudly that they meant to expose the\r\nstate of things existing in Kimberley; and in consequence innocent men\r\nwere sentenced to long terms of imprisonment.\r\n\r\nI heard one story in particular which, if true, throws a terrible light on\r\nthe state of affairs in the Diamond City. A young man of good connections,\r\nwho had arrived from England to seek his fortune in South Africa, was\r\nengaged in Kimberley at a small salary by one of the big diamond mining\r\nconcerns. After about three or four months' sojourn he felt so disgusted\r\nthat he declared quite loudly that as soon as he could put by sufficient\r\nmoney to pay his passage back to Europe he would do so, there to make it\r\nthe business of his life to enlighten his compatriots as to what was going\r\non in South Africa. He threatened, too, to warn his countrymen against\r\nthose who used to deluge England with prospectuses praising, in exalted\r\nterms, the wonderful state of things existing in South Africa and dilating\r\nupon the future prospects of Cape Colony. Old residents warned him he\r\nwould do better to restrain his wrath until he was out of reach of\r\ninterested parties; he did not listen to them, with the result that one\r\nmorning detectives appeared in the house where he lodged, searched his\r\nroom, and--found some diamonds hidden in a flower pot of geraniums which\r\nwas standing in his window and which the daughter of his landlady had\r\ngiven him that very morning. No protestations of the unhappy young fellow\r\navailed him. He was taken to Cape Town and condemned to seven years'\r\nimprisonment, the end of which he did not live to see, as he died a few\r\nmonths after he had been sentenced.\r\n\r\nThe story was freely current in South Africa; and, true or not, it is\r\nunquestionable that a large number of persons suffered in consequence of\r\nthe I.D.B. Act, no more serious proofs being offered that they had taken\r\nor concealed diamonds than the fact that the stones had been found in\r\nunlikely places in their rooms. Books without number have been written\r\nabout the I.D.B. Act, a great number evidently evincing hatred or revenge\r\nagainst Mr. Rhodes and his lieutenants.\r\n\r\nThe famous De Beers Company acquired a position of overwhelming strength\r\nin the social, economical and political life of South Africa, where\r\npractically it secured control of everything connected with finance and\r\nindustry. De Beers built cold storage rooms, a dynamite factory, ice\r\nhouses, interested itself in agriculture, fruit-growing, farming and\r\ncattle-breeding all over the Colony. It managed to acquire shares in all\r\nthe new mining enterprises whether in the Transvaal or in Rhodesia.\r\nPolitically it controlled the elections, and there were certain districts\r\nin the Cape Colony where no candidate unsupported by De Beers could hope\r\nto be elected to a seat in Parliament. The company had its own police,\r\nwhile its secret service was one of the most remarkable in the world,\r\nhaving among its archives a record of the private opinions of all the\r\npeople enjoying any kind of eminence in the country. In presence of De\r\nBeers the Governor himself was overshadowed; indeed, I do not think that\r\nif the Home Government had tried to oppose the organisation it would have\r\nhad much chance of coming out on top.\r\n\r\nSir Alfred Milner was the first man who saw that it would be impossible\r\nfor England to have the last word in South Africa unless those who, both\r\nin Cape Colony and in the Transvaal, were the real masters of the\r\nsituation were broken, and financial concerns persuaded to occupy\r\nthemselves solely with financial matters. Though Sir Alfred was wise\r\nenough, and prudent enough, not to allow his feelings on the subject to\r\nbecome public property, Rhodes was shrewd enough to guess that he would\r\nencounter a resolute adversary in the person of the High Commissioner.\r\nPerhaps had he kept his suspicions to himself instead of communicating\r\nthem to others he might have been persuaded in time to recognise that\r\nthere was a great deal in the opinions which Sir Alfred held as to the\r\nparticipation of financial organisations in political matters. If only\r\neach could have had a chance for a frank understanding, probably Milner\r\nwould not have objected to Rhodes continuing to control the vast machine\r\ninto which the diamond mines amalgamation had grown, so long as it\r\nconfined its operations to commerce.\r\n\r\nIf Government is exercised by a single person it is possible for it to\r\npossess the elements of justice and equity, and to be carried out with few\r\nmistakes of such gravity as would compromise the whole system. But,\r\nunfortunately, the South African autocracy meant an army of small\r\nautocrats, and it was they who compromised Rhodes and then sheltered\r\nthemselves behind his gigantic personality from the unpopularity and\r\ndetestation which their actions aroused in the whole of South Africa.\r\n\r\nI feel personally convinced that if, during the period which immediately\r\nfollowed upon the relief of Kimberley and of Lady smith, Rhodes had\r\napproached Sir Alfred and frankly told him that he wanted to try his luck\r\nwith the Dutch party, and to see whether his former friends and colleagues\r\nof the Afrikander Bond could not be induced to listen to reason, the High\r\nCommissioner would have been only too glad to meet him and to explain his\r\nviews on the whole question. Instead of doing so, Rhodes, carried away as\r\nhe always was by this everlasting desire to be the first everywhere, did\r\nnot even give a thought to the wisdom of confiding to anyone the efforts\r\nwhich he undoubtedly made to induce the Bond leaders to trust him again.\r\n\r\nThere was a moment when things got very near to an understanding between\r\nRhodes and Sir Alfred. This was when Mr. Sauer himself entertained the\r\nthought of letting Rhodes sway the future by making with the English\r\nGovernment conditions of a peace which would not wound to the quick the\r\nfeelings of the Dutch part of the population of the Colony.\r\n\r\nA circumstance, apparently insignificant, destroyed all the hopes that had\r\nbeen entertained by several who wished the Colossus well. Certain papers\r\nwere brought to Rhodes; these contained information likely to prove of use\r\nto him as well as to the English Government. After he had read them he\r\nasked that they should be left with him until the following day. The\r\nperson in charge of the documents had been asked not to part with them\r\neven for a single hour, as it was important that no one should be able to\r\ncopy documents which might seriously compromise certain people. Therefore,\r\nshe refused. Rhodes thereupon flew into a terrible passion and demanded to\r\nknow the reason for the apparent distrust. When told that it was not so\r\nmuch a question of distrust as the impossibility of breaking a promise\r\nonce given, he exclaimed that he would have nothing more to do with the\r\nwhole business, and started almost immediately afterwards his agitation\r\nfor the suspension of the Constitution in Cape Colony. But--and this is an\r\namusing detail to note--Rhodes used every possible effort to obtain\r\npossession of the papers he had been allowed to see, going so far as to\r\nhave the house searched of the person who had refused to allow him to keep\r\nthe documents--a revenge which was as mean as it was useless, because the\r\npapers in question had been at once returned to their rightful owners.\r\n\r\nThe request made by Rhodes to keep these documents produced a very bad\r\nimpression on those who had begun to entertain hopes that he might be\r\ninduced to throw the weight of his personality into the scale of a\r\nsettlement. It confirmed the suspicions held by the Afrikander party ever\r\nsince the Raid.\r\n\r\nThey say that everyone is afforded once the chance of one's lifetime. In\r\nthe case of Rhodes, he certainly missed by that action the one opportunity\r\nof reinstating himself once again upon the pinnacle whence the adventure\r\nof Doctor Jameson had caused him to fall.\r\n\r\nI remember that whilst these events were going on a political man, well\r\nacquainted with all details of the endeavour to secure a reconciliation\r\nbetween the Afrikander Bond and Rhodes, came to see me one evening. We\r\ntalked over the whole situation. He told me that there were people who\r\nthought it would be a good thing to inform Sir Alfred Milner of what was\r\ngoing on, in the hope that he might give Rhodes an inkling that he knew\r\nthat intrigue was rife at Groote Schuur, and at the same time express to\r\nRhodes with what satisfaction he personally would view the good offices of\r\nthe Colossus to influence both the South African League and the Afrikander\r\nBond. But we agreed that it was quite impossible. Such a course would not\r\ninspire the High Commissioner with an exalted idea as to our morality in\r\nmatters of trust, and, besides, it would not be playing the game in regard\r\nto Rhodes and his group. So the matter dropped; but Rhodes suspected, and\r\nnever forgave us or any of those whose thoughts ran on the same lines.\r\n\r\nWhether Sir Alfred Milner ever learned who had been trying to persuade the\r\nmaster of Groote Schuur to seek his co-operation in what would have been\r\nthe noblest deed of Rhodes' life, I have not been able to ascertain to the\r\npresent day. To tell the truth, I never tried to do so, the matter having\r\nlost all interest except as a matter of history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE OPENING OF THE NEW CENTURY\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch were the preoccupations, the intrigues and the emotions which, all\r\nthrough that monotonous winter of 1900-1901, agitated the inhabitants of\r\nand the visitors to Groote Schuur. Rhodes himself seemed to be the one man\r\nwho thought the least about them. It is certain that he felt hurt in his\r\npride and in his consciousness that the good which he had wanted to do\r\nfailed to be appreciated by those whom he had intended to benefit. But\r\noutwardly he made no sign that the matter interested him otherwise than\r\nfrom a purely objective point of view, that of the statesman who thinks\r\nthat it is part of his duty to put his services at the disposal of his\r\ncountry whenever required to do so. He felt also slightly surprised to\r\nfind, once he had expressed his willingness to use the experience of South\r\nAfrican affairs which he had acquired and which no one in the Cape\r\npossessed with such thoroughness, that the people who had appealed to him,\r\nand whom he had consented to meet half-way, would not give him the whole\r\nof their confidence; indeed, they showed some apprehension that he would\r\nuse his knowledge to their detriment.\r\n\r\nWhen one reviews all the circumstances that cast such a tragic shade over\r\nthe history of these eventful months, one cannot help coming to the\r\nconclusion that there was a good deal of misunderstanding on both sides\r\nand a deplorable lack of confidence everywhere. Rhodes had entirely lost\r\nground among his former friends, and would not understand that it was more\r\ndifficult, even on the part of those who believed in his good intentions,\r\nto efface the impression that he had been playing a double game ever since\r\nthe Raid had deprived him of the confidence and support which previously\r\nwere his all over Cape Colony.\r\n\r\nThe whole situation, as the new century opened, was a game of cross\r\npurposes. Sir Alfred Milner might have unravelled the skein, but he was\r\nthe one man whom no one interested in the business wished to ask for help.\r\nAnd what added to the tragedy was the curious but undisputable fact that\r\neven those who reviled Rhodes hoped he would return to power and assume\r\nthe Premiership in place of Sir Gordon Sprigg.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the respect which Sir Gordon Sprigg inspired, and of the\r\nesteem in which he was held by all parties, it was generally felt that if\r\nRhodes were once more at the helm he might return to a more reasonable\r\nview of the whole situation. In such an office, too, it was believed that\r\nRhodes would give the Colony the benefit of his remarkable gifts of\r\nstatecraft, as well as wield the authority which he liked so much to\r\nexercise, for the greater good of the country in general and of the\r\nBritish Government in particular. I believe that if at that moment Cecil\r\nRhodes had become the head of the Cabinet not one voice, even among the\r\nmost fanatic of the Afrikander Bond, would have objected. Those most\r\naverse to such a possibility were Rhodes' own supporters, a small group of\r\nmen whose names I shall refrain from mentioning.\r\n\r\nAll true friends of Rhodes, however, must surely have felt a keen regret\r\nthat he wasted his talents and his energy on those entangled and, after\r\nall, despicable Cape politics. The man was created for something better\r\nand healthier than that. He was an Empire Maker by nature, one who might\r\nhave won for himself everlasting renown had he remained \"King of\r\nRhodesia,\" as he liked to call himself. There, in the vast solitudes which\r\nby his enterprise and foresight had become a part of the British Empire,\r\nhe ought to have gone on uninterruptedly in the glorious task of bringing\r\ncivilisation to that hitherto unknown land. For such work his big nature\r\nand strange character were well fitted, and his wide-ranging mind\r\nappreciated the extent of the task. As he used to say himself sometimes,\r\nhe was never so happy and never felt so free and so much at peace with the\r\nworld and with mankind as among the Matoppo Hills.\r\n\r\nThe statesmanlike qualities which Cecil Rhodes undoubtedly possessed were\r\nweakened by contact with inferior people. It is impossible to create real\r\npoliticians and sound ones at the same rapid pace as financial magnates\r\nsprang up at the Cape as well as in the Transvaal. The class who entered\r\npolitics had as little real solidity about them as the houses and\r\ndwellings which were built at a moment's notice from corrugated iron and a\r\nfew logs. They thought that they understood how to govern a nation because\r\nthey had thoroughly mastered the mysteries of bookkeeping in problematical\r\nfinancial undertakings.\r\n\r\nI remember one afternoon when, talking with Rhodes in the grounds of\r\nGroote Schuur, he took me to the summer-house which he had built for\r\nhimself, whence one had a beautiful view over the country toward Table\r\nMountain. He leaned on the parapet of the little observatory which\r\nsurmounted the summer-house and lost himself in a day dream which, though\r\nlong, I felt I had better not interrupt. I can see his face and expression\r\nstill as, with his arms crossed over his chest, he gazed into space,\r\nthinking, thinking, and forgetting all else but the vision which he was\r\ncreating in that extraordinary brain of his. I am sure that he remained so\r\nfor over twenty minutes. Then he slowly turned round to me and said, with\r\nan accent indescribable in its intensity and poignancy:\r\n\r\n\"I have been looking at the North, at my own country--\"\r\n\r\n\"Why do you not always remain there?\" I exclaimed almost involuntarily, so\r\npainfully did the words strike me.\r\n\r\n\"Because they will not let me,\" he replied.\r\n\r\n\"They? Who?\" I asked again. \"Surely you can do what you like?\"\r\n\r\n\"You think so,\" he said, \"but you do not know; there are so many things;\r\nso many things. And they want me here too, and there is this place ...\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped, then relapsed once more into his deep meditation, leaving me\r\nwondering what was holding back this man who was reputed to do only what\r\nhe chose. Surely there would have been a far better, far nobler work for\r\nhim to do there in that distant North which, after all, in spite of the\r\nbeauties of Groote Schuur, was the only place for which he really cared.\r\nThere he could lead that absolutely free and untrammelled life which he\r\nloved; there his marvellous gifts could expand with the freedom necessary\r\nfor them to shine in their best light for the good of others as well as\r\nfor his own advantage. In Rhodesia he was at least free, to a certain\r\nextent, from the parasites.\r\n\r\nHow could one help pitying him and regretting that his indomitable will\r\ndid not extend to the courage of breaking from his past associations; that\r\nhe did not carry his determination far enough to make up his mind to\r\nconsecrate what was left of his life to the one task for which he was best\r\nfitted, that of making Rhodesia one of the most glorious possessions of\r\nthe British crown. Rhodes had done so much, achieved so much, had\r\nconceived such great things--as, for instance, the daring inception of the\r\nCape to Cairo Railway--that it surely could have been possible for him to\r\nrise above the shackling weaknesses of his environment.\r\n\r\nSo many years have passed since the death of Rhodes that, now, one can\r\njudge him objectively. To me, knowing him so well as I did, it seem that\r\nas his figure recedes into the background of history, it acquires more\r\ngreatness. He was a mystery to so many because few had been able to guess\r\nwhat it was that he really meant, or believed in, or hoped for. Not a\r\nreligious man by any means, he yet possessed that religion of nature which\r\npervades the soul of anyone who has ever lived for long face to face with\r\ngrandeurs and solitudes where human passions have no entrance. It is the\r\nadoration of the Greatness Who created the beauty which no touch can\r\ndefile, no tongue slander, and nobody destroy. Under the stars, to which\r\nhe confided so much of the thoughts which he had kept for himself in his\r\nyouth and early manhood, Rhodes became a different man. There in the\r\nsilence of the night or the dawn of early morning, when he started for\r\nthose long rides of which he was so fond, he became affectionate, kind,\r\nthoughtful and tender. There he thought, he dreamt, he planned, and the\r\nresult of these wanderings of his mind into regions far beyond those where\r\nthe people around him could stray was that he revealed himself as God had\r\nmade him and such as man hardly ever saw him.\r\n\r\nRhodes had always been a great reader; books, indeed, had a great\r\ninfluence over his mind, his actions and opinions. He used to read slowly,\r\nand what he had once assimilated he never forgot. Years after he would\r\nremember a passage treating of some historical fact, or of some social\r\ninterest, and apply it to his own work. For instance, the idea of the Glen\r\nGrey Act was suggested to him by the famous book of Mackenzie Wallace\r\ndealing with Russia,[B] in which he described the conditions under which\r\nRussian peasants then held their land. When Rhodes met the author of the\r\naforementioned volume at Sandringham, where both were staying with the\r\nthen Prince and Princess of Wales, he told him at once, with evident\r\npleasure at being able to do so, that it was his book which had suggested\r\nthat particular bit of legislation.\r\n\r\n    [B] \"Russia\" (Cassell).\r\n\r\nAnother occasion I remember when Rhodes spoke of the great impression\r\nproduced upon his opinions by a book called \"The Martyrdom of Man,\"[C] the\r\nwork of Winwood Reade, an author not very well known to the general\r\npublic. The essay was an unusually powerful negation of the Divinity.\r\nRhodes had, unfortunately for him, chanced across it just after he had\r\nleft the University, and during the first months following upon his\r\narrival in South Africa he read it in his moments of leisure between\r\nlooking for diamonds in the sandy plains of Kimberley. It completely upset\r\nall the traditions in which he had been nurtured--it must be remembered\r\nthat he was the son of a clergyman--and caused a revolt against the\r\nteachings of his former masters.\r\n\r\n    [C] Published in the U.S.A., 1875.\r\n\r\nThe adventurous young man who had left his native country well stocked\r\nwith principles which he was already beginning to find embarrassing, found\r\nin this volume an excuse for becoming the personage with whom the world\r\nwas to become familiar later on, when he appeared on the horizon as an\r\nEmpire Maker. He always kept this momentous book beside him, and used to\r\nread it when he wanted to strengthen himself in some hard resolution or\r\nwhen he was expected to steel his mind to the performance of some task\r\nagainst which his finest instincts revolted even whilst his sense of\r\nnecessity urged him onward.\r\n\r\nTalking with me on the occasion I have referred to above, in respect to\r\nthis volume which had left such weeds in his mind, he expressed to me his\r\ngreat enthusiasm about the ideas it contained, and spoke with unmeasured\r\napproval of its strong and powerful arguments against the existence of a\r\nDeity, and then exclaimed, \"You can imagine the impression which it\r\nproduced on me when I read it amid all the excitement of life at Kimberley\r\nnot long after leaving Oxford University.\" And he added in a solemn tone,\r\n\"That book has made me what I am.\"\r\n\r\nI think, however, that Rhodes exaggerated in attaching such influence to\r\nReade's essay. He was very interested in the supernatural, a feature which\r\nmore than once I have had occasion to observe in people who pretend that\r\nthey believe in nothing. I suspect that, had he been able to air the\r\ndoubts which must have assailed him sometimes when alone in the solitudes\r\nof Rhodesia, one would have discovered that a great deal of carelessness,\r\nof which he used to boast in regard to morality and to religion, was\r\nnothing but affectation. He treated God in the same offhand way he handled\r\nmen, when, in order to terrify them, he exposed before their horrified\r\neyes abominable theories, to which his whole life gave the lie. But in his\r\ninmost heart he knew very well that God existed. He would have felt quite\r\ncontent to render homage to the Almighty if only this could have been done\r\nincognito. In fact, he was quite ready to believe in God, but would have\r\nfelt extremely sorry had anyone suspected that such could be the case. The\r\nethical side of Cecil Rhodes' character remained all through his life in\r\nan unfinished state. It might perhaps have been the most beautiful side of\r\nhis many-sided life had he not allowed too much of what was material, base\r\nand common to rule him. Unwillingly, perhaps, but nevertheless certainly,\r\nhe gave the impression that his life was entirely dedicated to ignoble\r\npurposes. Perhaps the punishment of his existence lay precisely in the\r\nrapidity with which the words \"Rhodesian finance\" and \"Rhodesian politics\"\r\ncame to signify corruption and bribery. Even though he may not have been\r\nactually guilty of either, he most certainly profited by both. He\r\ninstituted in South Africa an utter want of respect for one's neighbour's\r\nproperty, which in time was a prime cause of the Transvaal War. Hated as\r\nhe was by some, distrusted as he remained by almost everybody, yet there\r\nwas nothing mean about Cecil Rhodes. Though one felt inclined to detest\r\nhim at times, yet one could not help liking and even loving him when he\r\nallowed one to see the real man behind the veil of cynicism and irony\r\nwhich he constantly assumed.\r\n\r\nWith Rhodes' death the whole system of Rhodesian politics perished. It\r\nthen became relatively easy for Sir Alfred Milner to introduce the\r\nnecessary reforms into the government of South Africa. The financial\r\nmagnates who had ruled at Johannesburg and Kimberley ceased to interest\r\nthemselves politically in the management of the affairs of the Government.\r\nThey disappeared one after the other, bidding good-bye to a country which\r\nthey had always hated, most of them sinking into an obscurity where they\r\nenjoy good dinners and forget the nightmare of the past.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch and the English elements have become reconciled, and loyalty to\r\nEngland, which seemed at the time of the Boer War, and during the years\r\nthat had preceded it, to have been confined to a small number of the\r\nEnglish, has become the rule. British Imperialism is no mere phantom: the\r\nUnion of South Africa has proved it to have a very virile body, and, what\r\nis more important, a lofty and clear-visioned soul.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nAN ESTIMATE OF SIR ALFRED MILNER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe conditions under which Sir Alfred Milner found himself compelled to\r\nshape his policy of conciliation were beset with obstacles and\r\ndifficulties. An understanding of these is indispensable to the one who\r\nwould read aright the history of that period of Imperial evolution.\r\n\r\nThe question of the refugees who overwhelmed Cape Colony with their\r\nlamentations, after they had been obliged to leave the Transvaal at\r\nthe beginning of the hostilities--the claims of the Rand\r\nmulti-millionaires--the indignation of the Dutch Colonists confined in\r\nconcentration camps by order of the military authorities--the Jingoes\r\nwho thought it would be only right to shoot down every Dutch\r\nsympathiser in the country: these were among the things agitating the\r\nSouth African public mind, and setting up conflicting claims\r\nimpossible of adjustment without bitter censure on one hand or the\r\nother. The wonder is that, amid all these antagonistic elements, Sir\r\nAlfred Milner contrived to fulfil the larger part of the tasks which\r\nhe had sketched out for himself before he left England.\r\n\r\nThe programme which Sir Alfred planned to carry out proved, in the long\r\nrun, to have been thoroughly sound in conception and practice, because it\r\ncontained in embryo all the conditions under which South Africa became\r\nunited. It is remarkable, indeed, that such a very short time after a war\r\nwhich seemed altogether to have compromised any hope of coalescing, the\r\nUnion of South Africa should have become an accomplished fact.\r\n\r\nYet, strange as it may appear, it is certain that up to his retirement\r\nfrom office Sir Alfred Milner was very little known in South Africa. He\r\nhad been so well compelled by force of circumstances to lead an isolated\r\nlife that very few had opportunity to study his character or gain insight\r\ninto his personality. In Cape Town he was judged by his policy. People\r\nforgot that all the time he was at Government House, Cape Town, he was a\r\nman as well as a politician: a man whose efforts and work in behalf of his\r\ncountry deserved some kind of consideration even from his enemies. It is\r\nuseless to discuss whether Sir Alfred did or did not make mistakes before\r\nthe beginning of the war. Why waste words over events which cannot be\r\nhelped, and about which there will always be two opinions? Personally, I\r\nthink that his errors were essentially of the kind which could not have\r\nbeen avoided, and that none of them ever compromised ultimately the great\r\nwork which he was to bring to a triumphant close.\r\n\r\nWhat I do think it is of value to point out is the calmness which he\r\ncontrived always to preserve under circumstances which must have been\r\nparticularly trying for him. Another outstanding characteristic was the\r\nquiet dignity with which he withstood unjustifiable attacks when dealing\r\nwith not-to-be-foreseen difficulties which arose while carrying on his\r\ngigantic task. Very few would have had the courage to remain silent and\r\nundaunted whilst condemned or judged for things he had been unable to\r\nalter or to banish. And yet this was precisely the attitude to which Sir\r\nAlfred Milner faithfully adhered. It stands out among the many proofs\r\nwhich the present Viscount Milner has given of his strong character as one\r\nof its most characteristic features, for it affords a brilliant\r\nillustration of what will, mastered by reason, can do.\r\n\r\nSince those perilous days I have heard many differing criticisms of Lord\r\nMilner's administration as High Commissioner in South Africa. What those\r\nwho express opinions without understanding that which lies under the\r\nsurface of history fail to take into account is the peculiar, almost\r\ninvidious position and the loneliness in which Sir Alfred had to stand\r\nfrom the very first day that he landed in Table Bay. He could not make\r\nfriends, dared not ask anyone's advice, was forced always to rely entirely\r\nupon his own judgment. He would not have been human had he not sometimes\r\nfelt misgivings as to the wisdom of what he was doing. He never had the\r\nhelp of a Ministry upon whom he could rely or with whom he could\r\nsympathise. The Cabinet presided over by Sir Gordon Sprigg was composed of\r\nvery well-intentioned men. But, with perhaps one single exception, it did\r\nnot possess any strongly individualistic personage capable of assisting\r\nSir Alfred in framing a policy acceptable to all shades of public opinion\r\nin the Colony, or even to discuss with him whether such a policy could\r\nhave been invented. As for the administration of which Mr. Schreiner was\r\nthe head, it was distinctly hostile to the policy inaugurated by Mr.\r\nJoseph Chamberlain, which Sir Alfred represented. Its members, indeed, put\r\nevery obstacle in the Governor's way, and this fact becoming known\r\nencouraged a certain spirit of rebellion among the Dutch section of the\r\npopulation. Neither one Ministry nor the other was able to be of any\r\nserious use to Milner, who, thus hampered, could neither frame a programme\r\nwhich accorded with his own judgment nor show himself in his true light.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VISCOUNT MILNER]\r\n\r\nAll these circumstances were never taken into consideration by friends or\r\nfoes, and, in consequence, he was made responsible for blunders which he\r\ncould not help and for mistakes which he was probably the first to\r\ndeplore. The world forgot that Sir Alfred never really had a free hand,\r\nwas always thwarted, either openly or in secret, by some kind of\r\nauthority, be it civil or military, which was in conflict with his own.\r\n\r\nIt was next to an impossibility to judge a man fairly under such\r\nconditions. All that one could say was that he deserved a good deal of\r\npraise for having, so successfully as he did, steered through the manifold\r\ndifficulties and delicate susceptibilities with which he had to contend in\r\nunravelling a great tangle in the history of the British Empire.\r\n\r\nThe Afrikander Bond hated him, that was a recognised fact, but this hatred\r\ndid Sir Alfred more good than anything else. The attacks directed against\r\nhim were so mean that they only won him friends among the very people to\r\nwhom his policy had not been acceptable. The abuse showered by certain\r\nnewspapers upon the High Commissioner not only strengthened his hands and\r\nhis authority, but transformed what ought to have remained a personal\r\nquestion into one in which the dignity as well as the prestige of the\r\nEmpire was involved. To have recalled him after he had been subjected to\r\nsuch treatment would have been equivalent to a confession that the State\r\nwas in the wrong. I have never been able to understand how men of such\r\nundoubted perception as Mr. Sauer or Mr. Merriman, or other leaders of the\r\nBond, did not grasp this fact. Sir Alfred himself put the aspect very\r\ncleverly before the public in an able and dignified speech which he made\r\nat the lunch offered to Lord Roberts by the Mayor and Corporation of Cape\r\nTown when he said, \"To vilify her representative is a strange way to show\r\none's loyalty to the Queen.\"\r\n\r\nA feature in Sir Alfred Milner's character, which was little known outside\r\nthe extremely small circle of his personal friends, was that when he was\r\nin the wrong he never hesitated to acknowledge the fact with\r\nstraightforward frankness. His judgments were sometimes hasty, but he was\r\nalways willing to amend an opinion on just grounds. There was a good deal\r\nof dogged firmness in his character, but not a shred of stubbornness or\r\nobstinacy. He never yielded one inch of his ground when he believed\r\nhimself to be in the right, but he was always amenable to reason, and he\r\nnever refused to allow himself to be convinced, even though it may be that\r\nhis natural sympathies were not on the side of those with whom he had got\r\nto deal. Very few statesmen could boast of such qualities, and they surely\r\nought to weigh considerably in the balance of any judgment passed upon\r\nViscount Milner.\r\n\r\nThe welfare of South Africa and the reputation of Sir Alfred would have\r\nbeen substantially enhanced had he been able to assert his own authority\r\naccording to his own judgment, without overrulings from Whitehall, and\r\nwith absolute freedom as to choice of colleagues. His position was most\r\ndifficult, and though he showed no outward sign of this fact, it is\r\nimpossible to believe that he did not feel its crushing weight. Between\r\nthe Bond, Mr. Hofmeyr, the race hatred which the Dutch accused him of\r\nfomenting, the question of the refugees, the clamours of the Jingo\r\nColonials, and the extreme seriousness of the military situation at one\r\ntime, it was perfectly marvellous that he did not break down. Instead, as\r\nvery few men could have done, he kept a clear-headed shrewdness, owing to\r\nwhich the Empire most certainly contracted an immense debt of gratitude\r\ntoward him for not having allowed himself to yield to the temptation of\r\nretaliating upon those who had made his task such a particularly hard one.\r\nHis forbearance ought never to be lost sight of in judging the\r\ncircumstances which brought about and attended the South African War.\r\nWhilst the war was going on it was not realised that Sir Alfred Milner was\r\nthe only man who--when the time arrived--could allay the passions arising\r\nfrom the conflict. But, without vanity, he knew, and could well afford to\r\nwait for his reward until history rather than men had judged him.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile Sir Alfred had to struggle against a sea of obstacles in\r\nwhich he was probably the only man clever enough not to drown himself--a\r\ndanger which overtook others who had tried to plunge into the complicated\r\npolitics of South Africa. A succession of administrators at Government\r\nHouse in Cape Town ended their political career there, and left, broken in\r\nspirit, damaged in reputation.\r\n\r\nAs for the local politicians, they were mostly honest mediocrities or\r\nadventurous spirits, who used their influence for their personal\r\nadvantage. An exception was Mr. Hofmeyr. But he was far too absorbed in\r\nsecuring the recognition of Dutch supremacy at the Cape to be able to work\r\non the milder plane necessary to bring about the one great result. The\r\npopularity of Mr. Hofmeyr was immense and his influence indisputable; but\r\nit was not a broad influence. He shuddered at the mere possibility of the\r\nTransvaal falling into the hands of the British.\r\n\r\nWhilst touching upon the subject of the Transvaal, I may say a word\r\nconcerning the strangely mixed population, for the sake of whom,\r\nofficially, Britain went to war. The war was entirely the work of the\r\nUitlanders, as they called themselves with a certain pride, but very few\r\nof whom possessed a drop of English blood. The British public at home was\r\ntold that it was necessary to fight President Kruger because Englishmen in\r\nthe Transvaal were being ill-treated and denied their legitimate rights.\r\nIn reality, this was one of those conventional reasons, lacking common\r\nsense and veracity, upon which nations are so often fed. If we enter\r\nclosely into the details of existence in the Transvaal, and examine who\r\nwere those who shouted so loudly for the franchise, we find that the\r\nmajority were either foreigners or Jews hailing from Frankfurt or Hamburg.\r\nMany of them had, to be sure, become naturalised British subjects, but I\r\ndoubt very much whether, among all the magnates of Johannesburg or of\r\nKimberley, more than one or two pure-blooded Englishmen could be found.\r\nRhodes, of course, was an exception, but one which confirmed the rule.\r\nThose others whose names can still be conjured with in South Africa were\r\nJews, mostly of Teutonic descent, who pretended that they were Englishmen\r\nor Colonials; nothing certain was known about their origin beyond the fact\r\nthat such or such small shops in Grahamstown, Durban or Cape Town had\r\nwitnessed their childish romps. The Beits, the Neumanns and the Wernhers\r\nwere German Jews; Barney Barnato was supposed to have been born under the\r\nshade of a Portuguese synagogue, and considered the fact as being just as\r\nglorious a one as would have been that of having in his veins \"all the\r\nblood of all the Howards.\" The Joels were Hebrews; the Rudds supposed to\r\nbelong to the same race through some remote ancestor; the Mosenthals,\r\nAbrahams, Phillipps, and other notabilities of the Rand and Kimberley,\r\nwere Jews, and one among the so-called Reformers, associated with the\r\nJameson Raid, was an American engineer, John Hays Hammond.\r\n\r\nThe war, which was supposed to win the franchise for Englishmen in the\r\nTransvaal, was in reality fought for the advantage of foreigners. Most\r\npeople honestly believed that President Kruger was aiming at destroying\r\nEnglish prestige throughout the vast dark continent, and would have been\r\nhorrified had they known what was going on in that distant land. Fortunes\r\nwere made on the Rand in a few days, but very few Englishmen were among\r\nthe number of those who contrived to acquire millions. Englishmen, indeed,\r\nwere not congenial to the Transvaal, whilst foreigners, claiming to be\r\nEnglishmen because they murdered the English language, abounded and\r\nprospered, and in time came sincerely to believe that they were British\r\nsubjects, owing to the fact that they continually kept repeating that\r\nBritain ought to possess the Rand.\r\n\r\nWhen Britain came really to rule the Rand the adventurers found it did not\r\nin the least secure the advantages which they had imagined would derive\r\nfrom a war they fostered. This question of the Uitlanders was as\r\nembarrassing for the English Government as it had been for that of the\r\nTransvaal. These adventurers, who composed the mass of the motley\r\npopulation which flourished on the Rand, would prove a source of annoyance\r\nto any State in the world. On the other hand, the importance acquired by\r\nthe so-called financial magnates was daily becoming a public danger,\r\ninasmuch as it tended to substitute the reign of a particular class of\r\nindividuals for the ruling of those responsible for the welfare of the\r\ncountry. These persons individually believed that they each understood\r\nbetter than the Government the conditions prevailing in South Africa, and\r\nperpetually accused Downing Street of not realising and never protecting\r\nBritish interests there.\r\n\r\nAmidst their recriminations and the publicity they could command from the\r\nPress, it is no wonder that Sir Alfred Milner felt bewildered. It is to\r\nhis everlasting honour that he did not allow himself to be overpowered. He\r\nwas polite to everybody; listened carefully to all the many wonderful\r\ntales that were being related to him, and, without compromising himself,\r\nproceeded to a work of quiet mental elimination that very soon made him\r\nthoroughly grasp the intricacies of any situation. He quickly came to the\r\nconclusion that President Kruger was not the principal obstacle to a\r\npeaceful development of British Imperialism in South Africa. If ever a\r\nconflict was foisted on two countries for mercenary motives it was the\r\nTransvaal War, and a shrewd and impartial mind like Milner's did not take\r\nlong to discover that such was the case.\r\n\r\nHe was not, however, a man capable of lending himself meekly to schemes of\r\ngreed, however wilily they were cloaked. His was not the kind of nature\r\nthat for the sake of peace submits to things of which it does not approve.\r\nThis man, who was represented as an oppressor of the Dutch, was in reality\r\ntheir best friend, and perhaps the one who believed the most in their\r\neventual loyalty to the English Crown. It is a thousand pities that when\r\nthe famous Bloemfontein Conference took place Sir Alfred Milner, as he\r\nstill was at that time, had not yet acquired the experience which later\r\nbecame his concerning the true state of things in the Transvaal. Had he at\r\nthat time possessed the knowledge which he was later to gain, when the\r\nbeginning of hostilities obliged so many of the ruling spirits of\r\nJohannesburg to migrate to the Cape, it is likely that he would have acted\r\ndifferently. It was not easy for the High Commissioner to shake off the\r\ninfluence of all that he heard, whether told with a good or bad intention,\r\nand it was still harder for him in those first days of his office to\r\ndiscern who was right or who was wrong among those who crowded their\r\nadvice upon him--and never forgave him when he did not follow their\r\nill-balanced counsels.\r\n\r\nConcerning the outstanding personality of Cecil Rhodes, the position of\r\nSir Alfred Milner was even more difficult and entangled than in regard to\r\nanyone else. It is useless to deny that he had arrived at Cape Town with\r\nconsiderable prejudice against Rhodes. He could not but look\r\ninterrogatively upon the political career of a man who at the very time he\r\noccupied the position of Prime Minister had lent himself to a conspiracy\r\nagainst the independence of another land. Moreover, Rhodes was supposed,\r\nperhaps not without reason, to be continually intriguing to return to\r\npower, and to be chafing in secret at the political inaction which had\r\nbeen imposed upon him, and for which he was himself responsible more than\r\nanyone else. The fact that after the Raid Rhodes had been abandoned by his\r\nformer friends harmed him considerably as a political man by destroying\r\nhis renown as a statesman to whom the destinies of an Empire might be\r\nentrusted with safety. One can truly say, when writing the story of those\r\nyears, that it resolved _itself_, into the vain struggle of Rhodes to\r\nrecover his lost prestige. Sir Alfred was continually being made\r\nresponsible for things of which he had not only been innocent, but of\r\nwhich, also, he had disapproved most emphatically. To mention only\r\none--the famous concentration camps. A great deal of fuss was made about\r\nthem at the time, and it was generally believed that they had been\r\ninstituted at the instigation of the High Commissioner. When consulted on\r\nthe subject Sir Alfred Milner had, on the contrary, not at all shared the\r\nopinion of those who had believed that they were a necessity, although\r\nultimately, for lack of earlier steps, they became so.\r\n\r\nThe Colony at that time found its effective government vested in the hands\r\nof the military authorities, who not infrequently acted upon opinions\r\nwhich were not based upon experience or upon any local conditions. They\r\nbelieved, too, implicitly what they were told, and when they heard people\r\nprotest, with tears in their eyes, their devotion to the British Crown,\r\nand lament over the leniency with which the Governor of Cape Colony looked\r\nupon rebellion, they could not possibly think that they were listening to\r\na tissue of lies, told for a purpose, nor guess that they were being made\r\nuse of. Under such conditions the only wonder is the few mistakes which\r\nwere made. To come back to the Boers' concentration camps, Sir Alfred\r\nMilner was not a sanguinary man by any means, and his character was far\r\ntoo firm to use violence as a means of government. It is probable that,\r\nleft alone, he would have found some other means to secure strict\r\nobedience from the refugees to orders which most never thought of\r\nresisting. Unfortunately for everybody concerned, he could do nothing\r\nbeyond expressing his opinion, and the circumstance that, out of a feeling\r\nof duty, he made no protestations against things of which he could not\r\napprove was exploited against him, both by the Jingo English party and by\r\nthe Dutch, all over South Africa. At Groote Schuur especially, no secret\r\nwas made by the friends of Rhodes of their disgust at the state of things\r\nprevailing in concentration camps, and it was adroitly brought to the\r\nknowledge of all the partisans of the Boers that, had Rhodes been master\r\nof the situation, such an outrage on individual liberty would never have\r\ntaken place. Sir Alfred Milner was subjected to unfair, ill-natured\r\ncriticisms which were as cunning as they were bitter. The concentration\r\ncamps afford only one instance of the secret antagonisms and injustices\r\nwhich Sir Alfred Milner had to bear and combat. No wonder thoughts of his\r\ndays in South Africa are still, to him, a bitter memory!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nCROSS CURRENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe intrigues which made Groote Schuur such a disagreeable place were\r\nalways a source of intense wonder to me. I could never understand their\r\nnecessity. Neither could I appreciate the kind of hypocrisy which induced\r\nRhodes continually to affirm that he did not care to return to power,\r\nwhilst in reality he longed to hold the reins again. It would have been\r\nfatally easy for Rhodes, even after the hideous mistake of the Raid, to\r\nregain his political popularity; a little sincerity and a little truth\r\nwere all that was needed. Unfortunately, both these qualities were wanting\r\nin what was otherwise a really gifted nature. Rhodes, it seemed by his\r\nways, could not be sincere, and though he seldom lied in the material\r\nsense of the word, yet he allowed others to think and act for him, even\r\nwhen he knew them to be doing so in absolute contradiction to what he\r\nought to have done himself. He appeared to have insufficient energy to\r\nenforce his will on those whom he despised, yet allowed to dictate to him\r\neven in matters which he ought to have kept absolutely under his own\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\nI shall always maintain that Rhodes, without his so-called friends, would\r\nmost certainly have been one of the greatest figures of his time and\r\ngeneration. He had a big soul, vast conceptions, and when he was not\r\ninfluenced by outward material details--upon which, unfortunately for\r\nhimself as well as for his reputation in history, he allowed his mind to\r\ndwell too often--his thoughts were always directed toward some higher\r\nsubject which absorbed his attention, inspired him, and moved him\r\nsometimes to actions that drew very near to the heroic. He might have gone\r\nto his grave not only with an unsullied, but also with a great reputation\r\nbased on grounds that were noble and splendid had he shaken off the\r\ncompanions of former times. Unhappily, an atmosphere of flattery and\r\nadulation had become absolutely necessary to him, and he became so used to\r\nit that he did not perceive that his sycophants never left him alone for a\r\nmoment. They watched over him like a policeman who took good care no\r\nforeign influence should venture to approach.\r\n\r\nThe end of all this was that Rhodes resented the truth when it was told\r\nhim, and detested any who showed independence of judgment or appreciation\r\nin matters concerning his affairs and projects. A man supposed to have an\r\niron will, yet he was weak almost to childishness in regard to these\r\nflattering satellites. It amused him to have always at his beck and call\r\npeople willing and ready to submit to his insults, to bear with his fits\r\nof bad temper, and to accept every humiliation which he chose to offer.\r\n\r\nCecil Rhodes never saw, or affected never to see, the disastrous influence\r\nall this had on his life.\r\n\r\nI remember asking him how it came that he seldom showed the desire to go\r\naway somewhere quite alone, if even for a day or two, so as to remain\r\nreally tête-à-tête with his own reflections. His reply was most\r\ncharacteristic: \"What should I do with myself? One must have people about\r\nto play cards in the evening.\" I might have added \"and to flatter one,\"\r\nbut refrained. This craving continually to have someone at hand to bully,\r\nscold, or to make use of, was certainly one of the failings of Rhodes'\r\npowerful mind. It also indicated in a way that thirst for power which\r\nnever left him until the last moment of his life. He had within him the\r\nweakness of those dethroned kings who, in exile, still like to have a\r\nCourt about them and to travel in state. Rhodes had a court, and also\r\ntravelled with a suite who, under the pretence of being useful to him,\r\neffectually barred access to any stranger. But for his entourage it is\r\nlikely that Rhodes might have outlived the odium of the Raid. But, as Mrs.\r\nvan Koopman said to me, \"What is the use of trying to help Rhodes when one\r\nis sure that he will never be allowed to perform all that he might\r\npromise?\"\r\n\r\nThe winter which followed upon the relief of Kimberley Rhodes spent almost\r\nentirely at Groote Schuur, going to Rhodesia only in spring. During these\r\nmonths negotiations between him and certain leaders of the Bond party went\r\non almost uninterruptedly. These were either conducted openly by people\r\nlike Mr. David de Waal, or else through other channels when not entrusted\r\nto persons whom it would be relatively easy later on to disavow. Once or\r\ntwice these negotiations seemed to take a favourable turn at several\r\npoints, but always at the last minute Rhodes withdrew under some pretext\r\nor other. What he would have liked would have been to have, as it were,\r\nthe Dutch party, the Bond, the English Colonists, the South African\r\nLeague, President Kruger, and the High Commissioner, all rolled into one,\r\nfall at his feet and implore him to save South Africa. When he perceived\r\nthat all these believed that there existed a possibility for matters to be\r\nsettled without his intervention, he hated every man of them with a hatred\r\nsuch as only very absolute natures can feel. To hear him express his\r\ndisgust with the military authorities, abuse in turns Lord Roberts, whom\r\nhe used to call an old man in his dotage, Lord Kitchener, who was a\r\nparticular antipathy, the High Commissioner, the Government at home, and\r\nthe Bond, was an education in itself. He never hesitated before making use\r\nof an expression of a coarseness such as does not bear repeating, and in\r\nhis private conversations he hurled insults at the heads of all. It is\r\ntherefore no wonder that the freedom of speech which Rhodes exercised at\r\nGroote Schuur added to the difficulties of a situation the brunt of which\r\nnot he, but Sir Alfred Milner, had to bear.\r\n\r\nMore than once the High Commissioner caused a hint to be conveyed to Cecil\r\nRhodes that he had better betake himself to Rhodesia, and remain there\r\nuntil there was a clearer sky in Cape Colony. These hints were always\r\ngiven in the most delicate manner, but Rhodes chose to consider them in\r\nthe light of a personal affront, and poured down torrents of invective\r\nupon the British Government for what he termed their ingratitude. The\r\ntruth of the matter was that he could not bring himself to understand that\r\nhe was not the person alone capable of bringing about a permanent\r\nsettlement of South Africa. The energy of his young days had left him, and\r\nperhaps the chronic disease from which he was suffering added to his\r\nconstant state of irritation and obscured the clearness of his judgment in\r\nthese post-raid days.\r\n\r\nI hope that my readers will not imagine from my reference that I have a\r\ngrudge of any kind against Doctor Jameson.[D] On the contrary, truth\r\ncompels me to say that I have seldom met a more delightful creature than\r\nthis old friend and companion of Cecil Rhodes, and I do believe he held a\r\nsincere affection for his chief. But Jameson, as well as Rhodes, was under\r\nthe influence of certain facts and of certain circumstances, and I do not\r\nthink that he was, at that particular moment about which I am writing, the\r\nbest adviser that Rhodes might have had. In one thing Doctor Jim was above\r\nsuspicion: he had never dirtied his hands with any of the financial\r\nspeculations which those about Rhodes indulged in, to the latter's\r\ndetriment much more than his own, considering the fact that it was he who\r\nwas considered as the father of their various \"smart\" schemes. Jameson\r\nalways kept aloof from every kind of shady transaction in so far as money\r\nmatters were concerned, and perhaps this was the reason why so many people\r\ndetested him and kept advising Rhodes to brush him aside, or, at all\r\nevents, not to keep him near him whilst the war was going on. His name was\r\nto the Dutch as a red rag to a very fierce and more than furious bull,\r\nwhile the Bond, as well as the burghers of the Transvaal, would rather\r\nhave had dealings with the Evil One himself than with Doctor Jim. Their\r\nprejudices against him were not to be shaken. In reality others about\r\nRhodes were far more dangerous than Jameson could ever have proved on the\r\nquestion of a South African settlement in which the rights of the Dutch\r\nelements in the Cape and Orange Free State would be respected and\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\n    [D] Dr. Jameson died November 26th, 1917.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE RT. HON. SIR LEANDER STARR JAMESON]\r\n\r\nWhatever might have been his faults, Doctor Jameson was neither a rogue\r\nnor a fool. For Rhodes he had a sincere affection that made him keenly\r\nalive to the dangers that might threaten the latter, and anxious to avert\r\nthem. But during those eventful months of the war the influence of the\r\nDoctor also had been weakened by the peculiar circumstances which had\r\narisen in consequence of the length of the Boer resistance. Before the war\r\nbroke out it had been generally supposed that three months would see the\r\nend of the Transvaal Republic, and Rhodes himself, more often than I care\r\nto remember, had prophesied that a few weeks would be the utmost that the\r\nstruggle could last. That this did not turn out to be the case had been a\r\nsurprise to the world at large and an intense disappointment to Cecil\r\nRhodes. He had all along nourished a bitter animosity against Kruger, and\r\nin regard to him, as well as Messrs. Schreiner, Merriman, Hofmeyr, Sauer\r\nand other one-time colleagues, he carried his vindictiveness to an extent\r\nso terrible that more than once it led him into some of the most\r\nregrettable actions in his life.\r\n\r\nCecil Rhodes possessed a curious shyness which gave to his character an\r\nappearance the more misleading in that it hid in reality a will of iron\r\nand a ruthlessness comparable to a _Condottiere_ of the Middle Ages. The\r\nfact was that his soul was thirsting for power, and he was inordinately\r\njealous of successes which anyone but himself had or could achieve in\r\nSouth Africa. I am persuaded that one of the reasons why he always tried\r\nby inference to disparage Sir Alfred Milner was his annoyance at the\r\nlatter's calm way of going on with the task which he had mapped out for\r\nhimself without allowing his mind to be troubled by the outcries of a mob\r\nwhom he despised from the height of his great integrity, unsullied honour,\r\nand consciousness of having his duty to perform. Neither could Rhodes ever\r\nsee in political matters the necessities of the moment often made it the\r\nduty of a statesman to hurl certain facts into oblivion and to reconcile\r\nhimself to new circumstances.\r\n\r\nThat he did disparage Sir Alfred Milner is unfortunately certain. I\r\nsincerely believe that the war would never have dragged on so long had not\r\nRhodes contrived to convey to the principal Boer leaders the impression\r\nthat while Sir Alfred Milner remained in South Africa no settlement would\r\nbe arrived at with the British Government, because the High Commissioner\r\nwould always oppose any concessions that might bring it to a successful\r\nand prompt issue. Of course Cecil Rhodes never said this in so many words,\r\nbut he allowed people to guess that such was his conviction, and it was\r\nonly after Sir Alfred had I left the Cape for Pretoria that, by a closer\r\ncontact with the Boers themselves, some of the latter's prejudices against\r\nhim vanished.\r\n\r\nAt last did the sturdy Dutch farmers realise that if there was one man\r\ndevoid of animosity against them, and desirous of seeing the end of a\r\nstruggle which was ruining a continent, it was Sir Alfred Milner. They\r\nalso discovered another thing concerning his political views and\r\nopinions--that he desired just as much as they did to destroy the power\r\nand influence of those multi-millionaires who had so foolishly believed\r\nthat after the war's end they would have at their disposal the riches\r\nwhich the Transvaal contained, so that, rather than becoming a part of the\r\nBritish Empire, it would in reality be an annexe of the London and Paris\r\nStock Exchanges.\r\n\r\nAs events turned out, by a just retribution of Providence, the magnates\r\nwho had let greedy ambition master them lost most of the advantages which\r\nthey had been able to snatch from President Kruger. Whether this would\r\nhave happened had Rhodes not died before the conclusion of peace remains\r\nan open question. It is certain he would have objected to a limitation of\r\nthe political power of the concerns in which he had got such tremendous\r\ninterests; it is equally sure that it would have been for him a cruel\r\ndisappointment had his name not figured as the outstanding signature on\r\nthe treaty of peace. There were in this strange man moments when his\r\npatriotism assumed an entirely personal shape, but, improbable as it may\r\nappear to the reader, there was sincerity in the conviction which he had\r\nthat the only man who understood what South Africa required was himself,\r\nand that in all that he had done he had been working for the benefit of\r\nthe Empire. There was in him something akin to the feeling which had\r\ninspired the old Roman saying, \"_Civis Romanum sum._\" He understood far\r\nbetter than any of the individuals by whom he was surrounded the true\r\nmeaning of the word Imperialism. Unfortunately, he was apt to apply it in\r\nthe personal sense, until, indeed, it got quite confused in his mind with\r\na selfish feeling which prompted him to put his huge personality before\r\neverything else. If one may do so, a reading of his mind would show that\r\nin his secret heart he felt he had not annexed Rhodesia to the Empire nor\r\namalgamated the Kimberley mines and organised De Beers for the benefit of\r\nhis native Britain, but in order to make himself the most powerful man in\r\nSouth Africa, and yet at the same time shrewdly realised that he could not\r\nbe the king he wished to become unless England stood behind him to cover\r\nwith her flag his heroic actions as well as his misdeeds.\r\n\r\nThat Rhodes' death occurred at an opportune moment cannot be denied. It is\r\na sad thing to say, but for South Africa true enough. It removed from the\r\npath of Sir Alfred Milner the principal obstacle that had stood in his way\r\never since his arrival at Cape Town. The Rhodesian party, deprived of its\r\nchief, was entirely harmless. Rhodesian politics, too, lost their strength\r\nwhen he was no longer there to impose them upon South Africa.\r\n\r\nOne of the great secrets of the enormous influence which the Colossus had\r\nacquired lay in the fact that he had never spared his money when it was a\r\nquestion of thrusting his will in directions favourable to his interest.\r\nNone of those who aspired to take his place could follow him on that road,\r\nbecause none were so superbly indifferent to wealth. Cecil Rhodes did not\r\ncare for riches for the personal enjoyments they can purchase. He was\r\nfrugal in his tastes, simple in his manners and belongings, and absolutely\r\ncareless as to the comforts of life. The waste in his household was\r\nsomething fabulous, but it is a question whether he ever participated in\r\nluxuries showered upon others. His one hobby had been the embellishment of\r\nGroote Schuur, which he had really transformed into something absolutely\r\nfairylike as regards its exterior beauties and the loveliness of its\r\ngrounds and gardens. Inside, too, the house, furnished after the old Dutch\r\nstyle, struck one by its handsomeness, though it was neither homelike nor\r\ncomfortable. In its decoration he had followed the plans of a clever\r\narchitect, to whose artistic education he had generously contributed by\r\ngiving to him facilities to travel in Europe, but he had not lent anything\r\nof his own personality to the interior arrangements of his home, which had\r\nalways kept the look of a show place, neither cared for nor properly\r\nlooked after.\r\n\r\nRhodes himself felt happier and more at his ease when rambling in his\r\nsplendid park and gazing on Table Mountain from his stoep than amidst the\r\nluxury of his richly furnished rooms. Sometimes he would sit for hours\r\nlooking at the landscape before him, lost in a meditation which but few\r\ncared to disturb, and after which he invariably showed himself at his best\r\nand in a softer mood than he had been before. Unfortunately, these moments\r\nnever lasted long, and he used to revenge himself on those who had\r\nsurprised him in such reveries by indulging in the most caustic and cruel\r\nremarks which he could devise in order to goad them out of all patience. A\r\nstrange man with strange instincts; and it is no wonder that, once, a\r\nperson who knew him well, and who had known him in the days of his youth\r\nwhen he had not yet developed his strength of character, had said of him\r\nthat \"One could not help liking him and one could not avoid hating him;\r\nand sometimes one hated him when one liked him most.\"\r\n\r\nSir Alfred Milner had neither liked nor hated him, perhaps because his\r\nmind was too well balanced to allow him to view him otherwise than with\r\nimpartiality and with a keen appreciation of his great qualities. He would\r\nhave liked to work with Rhodes, and would gladly have availed himself of\r\nhis experience of South Africa and of South African politicians. But Sir\r\nAlfred refused to be drawn into any compromises with his own conscience or\r\nto offend his own sense of right and wrong. He was always sincere, though\r\nhe was never given credit for being so in South Africa. Sir Alfred Milner\r\ncould not understand why Rhodes, instead of resolutely asserting that he\r\nwanted to enter into negotiations with the Bond in order to win its\r\nco-operation in the great work of organising the new existence of South\r\nAfrica on a sound and solid basis, preferred to cause promises to be made\r\nto the Bond which he would never consent to acknowledge.\r\n\r\nThese tortuous roads, which were so beloved by Rhodes, were absolutely\r\nabhorrent to the High Commissioner. When Rhodes started the agitation for\r\nthe suspension of the Constitution, which occupied his thoughts during the\r\nlast months of his life--an agitation which he had inaugurated out of\r\nspite against Mr. Sauer and Mr. Hofmeyr, who had refused to dance to\r\nRhodes' tune--Sir Alfred Milner had at once seen through the underlying\r\nmotives of the moment, and what he discerned had not increased his\r\nadmiration for Rhodes. Sir Alfred had not opposed the plans, but he had\r\nnever been sanguine as to their chance of success, and they were not in\r\naccordance with his own convictions. Had he thought they had the least\r\nchance of being adopted, most certainly he would have opposed them with\r\njust as much energy as Sir Gordon Sprigg had done. He saw quite well that\r\nit would not have been opportune or politic to put himself into open\r\nopposition to Rhodes. Sir Alfred therefore did not contradict the rumours\r\nwhich attributed to him the desire to reduce the Cape to the condition of\r\na Crown Colony, but bent his energy to the far more serious task of\r\nnegotiating a permanent peace with the leading men in the Transvaal, a\r\npeace for which he did not want the protection of Rhodes, and to which an\r\nassociation with Rhodes might have proved inimical to the end in view--the\r\nideal of a South African Federation which Rhodes had been the first to\r\nvisualise, but which Providence did not permit him to see accomplished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTHE CONCENTRATION CAMPS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to speak or write about the South African War without\r\nmentioning the Concentration Camps. A great deal of fuss was made about\r\nthem, not only abroad, where all the enemies of England took a particular\r\nand most vicious pleasure in magnifying the so-called cruelties which were\r\nsupposed to take place, but also in the English Press, where long and\r\nheartrending accounts appeared concerning the iniquities and injustices\r\npractised by the military authorities on the unfortunate Boer families\r\nassembled in the Camps.\r\n\r\nIn recurring to this long-forgotten theme, I must first of all say that I\r\ndo not hold a brief for the English Government or for the administration\r\nwhich had charge of British interests in South Africa. But pure and simple\r\njustice compels me to protest, first against the use which was made for\r\nparty purposes of certain regrettable incidents, and, more strongly still,\r\nagainst the totally malicious and ruthless way in which the incidents were\r\ninterpreted.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary before passing a judgment on the Concentration Camps to\r\nexplain how it came about that these were organised. At the time of which\r\nI am writing people imagined that by Lord Kitchener's orders Boer women,\r\nchildren and old people were forcibly taken away from their homes and\r\nconfined, without any reason for such an arbitrary proceeding, in\r\nunhealthy places where they were subjected to an existence of privation as\r\nwell as of humiliation and suffering. Nothing of the kind had taken place.\r\n\r\nThe idea of the Camps originated at first from the Boers themselves in an\r\nindirect way. When the English troops marched into the Orange Free State\r\nand the Transvaal, most of the farmers who composed the bulk of the\r\npopulation of the two Republics having taken to arms, there was no one\r\nleft in the homes they had abandoned save women, children and old men no\r\nlonger able to fight. These fled hurriedly as soon as English detachments\r\nand patrols were in sight, but most of the time they did not know where\r\nthey could fly to, and generally assembled in camps somewhere on the\r\nveldt, where they hoped that the British troops would not discover them.\r\nThere, however, they soon found their position intolerable owing to the\r\nwant of food and to the lack of hygienic precautions.\r\n\r\nThe British authorities became aware of this state of things and could not\r\nbut try to remedy it. Unfortunately, this was easier said than done. To\r\ncome to the help of several thousands of people in a country where\r\nabsolutely no resources were to be found was a quite stupendous task, of a\r\nnature which might well have caused the gravest anxieties to the men\r\nresponsible for the solution. It was then that the decision was reached to\r\norganise upon a reasonable scale camps after the style of those which\r\nalready had been inaugurated by the Boers themselves.\r\n\r\nThe idea, which was not a bad one, was carried out in an unfortunate\r\nmanner, which gave to the world at large the idea that the burgher\r\nfamilies who were confined in these camps were simply put into a prison\r\nwhich they had done nothing to deserve. The Bond Press, always on the\r\nalert to reproach England, seized hold of the establishment of the Camps\r\nto transform into martyrs the persons who had been transferred to them,\r\nand soon a wave of indignation swept over not only South Africa, but also\r\nover Britain. This necessary act of human civilisation was twisted to\r\nappear as an abuse of power on the part of Lord Roberts and especially of\r\nLord Kitchener, who, in this affair, became the scapegoat for many sins he\r\nhad never committed. The question of the Concentration Camps was made the\r\nsubject of interpellations in the House of Commons, and indignation\r\nmeetings were held in many parts of England. The Nonconformist Conscience\r\nwas deeply stirred at what was thought to be conduct which not even the\r\nnecessities of war could excuse. Torrents of ink were spilt to prove that\r\nat the end of the nineteenth century measures and methods worthy of the\r\nInquisition were resorted to by British Government officials, who--so the\r\nready writers and ready-tongued averred--with a barbarity such as the\r\nMiddle Ages had not witnessed, wanted to be revenged on innocent women and\r\nchildren for the resistance their husbands and fathers were making against\r\nan aggression which in itself nothing could justify.\r\n\r\nSo far as the Boers themselves were concerned, I think that a good many\r\namong them viewed the subject with far more equanimity than the English\r\npublic. For one thing, the fact of their women and children being put in\r\nplaces where at least they would not die of hunger must have come to them\r\nrather in the light of a relief than anything else. Then, too, one must\r\nnot lose sight of the conditions under which the Boer burghers and farmers\r\nused to exist in normal times. Cleanliness did not rank among their\r\nvirtues; and, as a rule, hygiene was an unknown science. They were mostly\r\ndirty and neglected in their personal appearance, and their houses were\r\ncertainly neither built nor kept in accordance with those laws of\r\nsanitation which in the civilised world have become a matter of course.\r\nWater was scarce, and the long and torrid summers, during which every bit\r\nof vegetation was dried up on the veldt, had inured the population to\r\ncertain privations which would have been intolerable to Europeans. These\r\nthings, and the unfortunate habits of the Boers, made it extremely\r\ndifficult, if not impossible, to realise in the Camps any approach to the\r\ndegree of cleanliness which was desirable.\r\n\r\nTo say that the people in the Concentration Camps were happy would be a\r\ngross exaggeration, but to say that they were martyrs would convey an\r\nequally false idea. When judging of facts one ought always to remember the\r\nlocal conditions under which these facts have developed. A Russian moujik\r\nsent to Siberia does not find that his life there is very much different\r\nfrom what it was at home, but a highly civilised, well-educated man,\r\ncondemned to banishment in those frozen solitudes, suffers acutely, being\r\ndeprived of all that had made existence sweet and tolerable to him. I feel\r\ncertain that an Englishman, confined in one of the Concentration Camps of\r\nSouth Africa, would have wished himself dead ten times a day, whilst the\r\nwife of a Boer farmer would not have suffered because of missing soap and\r\nwater and clean towels and nicely served food, though she might have felt\r\nthe place hot and unpleasant, and might have lamented over the loss of the\r\nhome in which she had lived for years.\r\n\r\nThe Concentration Camps were a necessity, because without them thousands\r\nof people, the whole white population of a country indeed, amounting to\r\nsomething over sixty thousand people, would have died of hunger and cold.\r\n\r\nThe only means of existence the country Boers had was the produce of their\r\nfarms. This taken away from them, they were left in the presence of\r\nstarvation, and starvation only. This population, deprived of every means\r\nof subsistence, would have invaded Cape Colony, which already was overrun\r\nwith white refugees from Johannesburg and the Rand, who had proved a\r\nprolific source of the greatest annoyance to the British Government. To\r\nallow this mass of miserable humanity to wander all over the Colony would\r\nhave been inhuman, and I would like to know what those who, in England and\r\nupon the Continent, were so indignant over the Concentration Camps would\r\nhave said had it turned out that some sixty thousand human creatures had\r\nbeen allowed to starve.\r\n\r\nThe British Government, owing to the local conditions under which the\r\nSouth African War came to be fought, found itself in a dilemma, out of\r\nwhich the only escape was to try to relieve wholesale misery in the most\r\npractical manner possible. There was no time to plan out with deliberation\r\nwhat ought to be done; some means had to be devised to keep a whole\r\npopulation alive whom an administration would have been accused of\r\nmurdering had there been delay in feeding it.\r\n\r\nThere was also another danger to be faced had the veldt been allowed to\r\nbecome the scene of a long-continued migration of nations--that of\r\nallowing the movements of the British troops to become known, thereby\r\nlengthening a war of already intolerable length, to say nothing of\r\nexposing uselessly the lives of English detachments, which, in this\r\nguerrilla kind of warfare, would inevitably have occurred had the Boer\r\nleaders remained in constant communication with their wandering\r\ncompatriots.\r\n\r\nAltogether the institution of the Concentration Camps was not such a bad\r\none originally. Unfortunately, they were not organised with the\r\nseriousness which ought to have been brought to bear on such a delicate\r\nmatter, and their care was entrusted to people who succeeded, unwittingly\r\nperhaps, in making life there less tolerable than it need have been.\r\n\r\nI visited some of the Concentration Camps, and looked into their interior\r\narrangements with great attention. The result of my personal observations\r\nwas invariably the same--that where English officials were in charge of\r\nthese Camps everything possible was done to lighten the lot of their\r\ninmates. But where others were entrusted with surveillance, every kind of\r\nannoyance, indignity and insult was offered to poor people obliged to\r\nsubmit to their authority.\r\n\r\nIn this question, as in many others connected with the Boer War, it was\r\nthe local Jingoes who harmed the British Government more than anything\r\nelse, and the Johannesburg Uitlanders, together with the various Volunteer\r\nCorps and Scouts, brought into the conduct of the enterprises with which\r\nthey were entrusted an intolerance and a smallness of spirit which\r\ndestroyed British prestige far more than would have done a dozen\r\nunfortunate wars. The very fact that one heard these unwise people openly\r\nsay that every Boer ought to be killed, and that even women and children\r\nought to be suppressed if one wanted to win the war, gave abroad the idea\r\nthat England was a nation thirsting for the blood of the unfortunate\r\nAfrikanders. This mistaken licence furnished the Bond with the pretext to\r\npersuade the Dutch Colonists to rebel, and the Boer leaders with that of\r\ngoing on with their resistance until their last penny had been exhausted\r\nand their last gun had been captured.\r\n\r\nWithout these detestable Jingoes, who would have done so much harm not\r\nonly to South Africa, but also to their Mother Country, England, it is\r\ncertain that an arrangement, which would have brought about an honourable\r\npeace for everybody, could have come much sooner than it did. A\r\nsignificant fact worth remembering--that the Boers did not attempt to\r\ndestroy the mines on the Rand--goes far to prove that they were not at all\r\nso determined to hurt British property, or to ruin British residents, or\r\nto destroy the large shareholder concerns to which the Transvaal owed its\r\ncelebrity, as was credited to them.\r\n\r\nWhen the first rumours that terrible things were going on in the\r\nConcentration Camps reached England there were found at once amateurs\r\nwilling to start for South Africa to investigate the truth of the\r\naccusations. A great fuss was made over an appeal by Lady Maxwell, the\r\nwife of the Military Governor of Pretoria, in which she entreated America\r\nto assist her in raising a fund to provide warm clothing for the Boer\r\nwomen and children. Conclusions were immediately drawn, saddling the\r\nmilitary authorities with responsibility for the destitution in which\r\nthese women and children found themselves. But in the name of common\r\nsense, how could one expect that people who had run away before what they\r\nbelieved to be an invasion of barbarians determined to burn down and\r\ndestroy all their belongings--how could one expect that these people in\r\ntheir flight would have thought about taking with them their winter\r\nclothes, which, in the hurry of a departure in a torrid summer, would only\r\nhave proved a source of embarrassment to them? More recently we have seen\r\nin Belgium, France, Poland and the Balkans what occurred to the refugees\r\nwho fled before foreign invasion. The very fact of Lady Maxwell's appeal\r\nproved the solicitude of the official English classes for the unfortunate\r\nBoers and their desire to do something to provide them with the\r\nnecessaries of life.\r\n\r\nEverybody knows the amount of money which is required in cases of this\r\nkind, and--in addition to America's unstinting response--public and\r\nprivate charity in Britain flowed as generously as it always does upon\r\nevery occasion when an appeal is made to it in cases of real misfortune.\r\nBut when it comes to relieve the wants of about sixty-three thousand\r\npeople, of all ages and conditions, this is not so easy to do as persons\r\nfond of criticising things which they do not understand are apt sweepingly\r\nto declare. Very soon the question of the Concentration Camps became a\r\nParty matter, and was made capital of for Party purposes without\r\ndiscrimination or restraint. Sham philanthropists filled the newspapers\r\nwith their indignation, and a report was published in the form of a\r\npamphlet by Miss Hobhouse, which, it is to be feared, contained some\r\npercentage of tales poured into her ears by people who were nurtured in\r\nthe general contempt for truth which at that time existed in South Africa.\r\n\r\nIf the question of Concentration Camps had been examined seriously, it\r\nwould have been at once perceived what a tremendous burden the\r\nresponsibility of having to find food and shelter for thousands of enemy\r\npeople imposed on English officials. No one in Government circles\r\nattempted or wished to deny, sorrowful as it was to have to recognise it,\r\nthat the condition of the Camps was not, and indeed could not be, nearly\r\nwhat one would have wished or desired. On the other hand, the British\r\nauthorities were unremitting in their efforts to do everything which was\r\ncompatible with prudence to improve the condition of these Camps.\r\nNotwithstanding, people were so excited in regard to the question, and it\r\nwas so entirely a case of \"Give a dog a bad name,\" that even the\r\nappointment of an Imperial Commission to report on the matter failed to\r\nbring them to anything approaching an impartial survey. Miss Hobhouse's\r\nreport had excited an emotion only comparable to the publication of Mrs.\r\nBeecher Stowe's famous novel, \"Uncle Tom's Cabin.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Hobhouse came to South Africa inspired by the most generous motives,\r\nbut her lack of knowledge of the conditions of existence common to\r\neveryone in that country prevented her from forming a true opinion as to\r\nthe real hardship of what she was called upon to witness. Her own\r\ninterpretations of the difficulties and discomforts which she found\r\nherself obliged to face proved that she had not realised what South Africa\r\nreally was. Her horror at the sight of a snake in one of the tents she\r\nvisited could only evoke a smile from those who had lived for some time in\r\nthat country, as a visitor of that particular kind was possible even in\r\nthe suburbs of Cape Town, and certainly offered nothing wonderful in a\r\ntent on the high veldt. The same remark can be applied to the hotels,\r\nwhich Miss Hobhouse described as something quite ghastly. Everyone who\r\nknew what South Africa really was could only agree with her that the\r\nmiserable places there were anything but pleasant residences, but the fuss\r\nwhich she made as to these trivial details could only make one sceptical\r\nas to the genuineness of the other scenes which she described at such\r\nlength. No one who had had occasion to watch the development of the war or\r\nthe circumstances which had preceded it could bring himself to believe\r\nwith her that the British Government was guilty of premeditated cruelty.\r\n\r\nOf course, it was quite dreadful for those who had been taken to the\r\nConcentration Camps to find themselves detained there against their will,\r\nbut at the same time, as I have already remarked, the question remains as\r\nto what these people would have done had they been left absolutely\r\nunprotected and unprovided for among the remnants of what had once been\r\ntheir homes. It was certain that Miss Hobhouse's pamphlet revealed a\r\nparlous state of things, but did she realise that wood, blankets, linen\r\nand food were not things which could be transported with the quickness\r\nthat those responsible heartily desired? Did she remember that the British\r\ntroops also had to do without the most elementary comforts, in spite of\r\nall the things which were constantly being sent from home for the benefit\r\nof the field forces? Both had in South Africa two enemies in common that\r\ncould not be subdued--distance and difficulty of communication. With but a\r\nsingle line of railway, which half the time was cut in one place or\r\nanother, it was but natural that the Concentration Camps were deprived of\r\na good many things which those who were compelled to live within their\r\nlimits would, under different circumstances or conditions, have had as a\r\nmatter of course.\r\n\r\nMiss Hobhouse had to own that she met with the utmost courtesy from the\r\nauthorities with whom she had to deal, a fact alone which proved that the\r\nGovernment was only too glad to allow people to see what was being done\r\nfor the Boer women and children, and gratefully appreciated every useful\r\nsuggestion likely to lighten the sad lot of those in the Camps.\r\n\r\nIt is no use denying, and indeed no one, Sir Alfred Milner least of all,\r\nwould have denied that some of the scenes witnessed by Miss Hobhouse,\r\nwhich were afterwards described with such tremulous indignation, were of a\r\nnature to shock public opinion both at home and abroad. But, at the same\r\ntime, it was not fair to circumstances or to people to have a false\r\nsentimentality woven into what was written. Things ought to have been\r\nlooked upon through the eyes of common sense and not through the\r\nrefracting glasses of the indignation of the moment. It was a libel to\r\nsuggest that the British authorities rendered themselves guilty of\r\ndeliberate cruelty, because, on the contrary, they always and upon every\r\noccasion did everything they could to lighten the lot of the enemy peoples\r\nwho had fallen into their hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nTHE PRISONERS' CAMPS\r\n\r\n\r\nI went myself very carefully into the details of whatever information I\r\nwas able to gather in regard to the treatment of Boer prisoners in the\r\nvarious Camps, notably at Green Point near Cape Town, and I always had to\r\ncome to the conclusion that nothing could have been better. Is it likely\r\nthat, when such an amount of care was bestowed upon the men, the women and\r\nchildren should have been made the objects of special persecution? No\r\nimpartial person could believe such a thing to have been possible, and I\r\nfeel persuaded that if the people who in England contributed to make the\r\nposition of the British Government more difficult than already it was,\r\ncould have glanced at some Prisoners' Camps, for instance, they would very\r\nquickly have recognised that an unbalanced sentimentality had exaggerated\r\nfacts, and even in some cases distorted them.\r\n\r\nIn Green Point the prisoners were housed in double-storied buildings which\r\nhad balconies running round them. Here they used to spend many hours of\r\nthe day, for not only could they see what was going on around the Camps\r\nbut also have a good view of the sea and passing ships. Each room held six\r\nmen, and there was besides a large mess-room downstairs in each building\r\nwhich held about ninety people. Each Boer officer had a room for himself.\r\nWhen, later on, the number of prisoners of war was increased, tents had to\r\nbe erected to accommodate them; but this could hardly be considered\r\nhardship in the climate which prevails at the Cape, and cannot be compared\r\nto what at the present moment the soldiers of the Allies are enduring in\r\nthe trenches. The tents were put in a line of twenty each, and each score\r\nhad a building attached for the men in that line to use as a dormitory if\r\nthey chose. Excellent bathrooms and shower-baths were provided, together\r\nwith a plentiful supply of water. The feeding of the prisoners of war was\r\non a substantial scale, the daily rations per man including:\r\n\r\n     Bread          1¼ lb.\r\n     Meat (fresh)    1 lb.\r\n     Sugar           3 oz.\r\n     Coal (or)       1 lb.\r\n     Wood (or)       2 lb.\r\n     Coal and wood  1½ lb.\r\n     Vegetables      ½ lb.\r\n     Jam             ¼ lb., or 6 oz. of\r\n                      vegetables in lieu.\r\n\r\nCoffee, milk and other items were also in like generous apportionments.\r\n\r\nThe clothing issued to the prisoners, as asked for by them, to give the\r\nmonth of June, 1901, as an instance, was:\r\n\r\n     Boots         143 pairs\r\n     Braces         59 pairs\r\n     Hats          164\r\n     Jackets       133\r\n     Shirts        251\r\n     Socks         222 pairs\r\n     Trousers      166\r\n     Waistcoats     87\r\n\r\nand other small sundries.\r\n\r\nAt Green Point Camp ample hospital accommodation was provided for the\r\nsick, and there was a medical staff thoroughly acquainted with the Dutch\r\nlanguage and Boer habits. There was electric light in every ward, as well\r\nas all other comforts compatible with discipline.\r\n\r\nIn the first six months of 1901 only five men died in the Camps, the\r\naverage daily strength of which was over 5,000 men. As for the sick, the\r\naverage rarely surpassed 1 per cent., amongst which were included wounded\r\nmen, the cripples, and the invalids left behind from the parties of war\r\nprisoners sent oversea to St. Helena or other places.\r\n\r\nThe hospital diet included, as a matter of course, many things not forming\r\npart of the ordinary rations, such as extra milk, meat extracts, and\r\nbrandy. A suggestive fact in that respect was that though the medical\r\nofficers in charge of the Camps often appealed to Boer sympathisers to\r\nsend them eggs, milk and other comforts for the sick prisoners, they\r\nhardly ever met with response; and in the rare cases when it happened, it\r\nwas mostly British officials or officers' wives who provided these\r\nluxuries.\r\n\r\nThe spiritual needs of the prisoners of war were looked after with\r\nconsideration; there was a recreation room, and, during the time that a\r\nlarge number of very young Boers were in Camps, an excellent school, in\r\nwhich the headmaster and assistant teachers held teachers' certificates.\r\nUnder the Orange River Colony this school was later transferred to the\r\nPrisoners of War Camp at Simonstown, and in both places it did a\r\nconsiderable amount of good. The younger Boers took very kindly and almost\r\nimmediately to English games such as football, cricket, tennis and quoits,\r\nfor which there was plenty of room, and the British authorities provided\r\nrecreation huts, and goal posts and other implements. The Boers also\r\namused themselves with amateur theatricals, club-swinging, and even formed\r\na minstrel troup called the \"Green Point Spreemos.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Camps there was a shop where the Boers could buy anything that they\r\nrequired in reason at prices regulated by the Military Commandant. Beyond\r\nthis, relatives and friends were allowed to send them fruit or anything\r\nelse, with the exception of firearms. In the Boer laagers were coffee\r\nshops run by speculative young Boers. The prisoners used to meet there in\r\norder to drink coffee, eat pancakes and talk to heart's content. This\r\nparticular spot was generally called Pan Koek Straat, and the wildest\r\nrumours concerning the war seemed to originate in it.\r\n\r\nNow as to the inner organisation of the Camps. The prisoners were allowed\r\nto choose a corporal from their midst and also to select a captain for\r\neach house. Over the whole Camp there reigned a Boer Commandant, assisted\r\nby a Court of \"Heemraden\" consisting of exlandrosts and lawyers appointed\r\nby the prisoners of war themselves. Any act of insubordination or\r\ninattention to the regulations, sanitary or otherwise, was brought before\r\nthis court and the guilty party tried and sentenced. When the latter\r\nrefused to abide by the judgment of the Boer court he was brought before\r\nthe Military Commandant, but for this there was very seldom need.\r\n\r\nThe prisoners of war had permission to correspond with their friends and\r\nrelatives, and were allowed newspapers and books. The former, however,\r\nwere rather too much censored, which fact constituted an annoyance which,\r\nwith the exertion of a little tact, might easily have been avoided.\r\n\r\nAs will be seen from the details, the fate of the Boer prisoners of war\r\nwas not such a bad one after all. Nor, either, was life in the\r\nConcentration Camps, and I have endeavoured to throw some new light on the\r\nsubject to rebut the old false rumours which, lately, the German\r\nGovernment revived when taxed with harsh treatment of their own prisoners\r\nof war, so as to draw comparisons advantageously to themselves.\r\n\r\nWhile adhering to my point, I quite realise that it would be foolish to\r\nassert that all the Concentration Camps were organised and administered on\r\nthe model of the Green Point Camp, where its vicinity to Cape Town allowed\r\nthe English authorities to control everything that was going on. In the\r\ninterior of the country things could not be arranged upon such an\r\nexcellent scale, but had there not existed such a state of irritation all\r\nover the whole of South Africa--an irritation for which the so-called\r\nEnglish loyalists must also share the blame--matters would not have grown\r\nso sadly out of proportion to the truth, painful though the facts were in\r\nsome cases.\r\n\r\nThis question of the Camps was admittedly a most difficult one. It was the\r\nresult of a method of warfare which was imposed upon England by\r\ncircumstances, but for which no individual Minister or General was solely\r\nresponsible. The matter was brought about by successive steps that turned\r\nout to be necessary, though they were deplorable in every respect. Failing\r\nthe capture of the Boer commandoes, which was well-nigh impossible, the\r\nBritish troops were driven to strip the country, and stripping the country\r\nmeant depriving not only the fighting men but also the women and children\r\nof the means of subsistence. Concentration, therefore, followed\r\ninevitably, and England found itself burdened with the immense\r\nresponsibility of feeding, housing and clothing some sixty thousand women\r\nand children.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the British officers in charge of the Concentration Camps\r\nstruggling manfully with this crushing burden of anxiety, and doing all\r\nthat lay within their power to alleviate the sufferings of this multitude,\r\ncruel and painful things happened. The food, which was sufficient and\r\nwholesome for soldiers, could not do for young people, and yet it was\r\nimpossible to procure any other for them. If the opinion of the military\r\nhad been allowed to be expressed openly, one would have found probably\r\nthat they thought England ought never to have assumed this responsibility,\r\nbut rather have chosen the lesser evil and left these people on their\r\nfarms, running the risk of the Boers provisioning themselves therefrom.\r\nThe risk would not, perhaps, have been so great as could have been\r\nsupposed at first sight, but then this ought to have been done from the\r\nvery beginning of the war, and the order to burn the Boer farms ought\r\nnever to have been given. But once the Boer farms had been deprived of\r\ntheir military use to the enemy, these people could not be turned back to\r\nstarve on the veldt; the British had to feed them or earn the reproach of\r\nhaving destroyed a nation by hunger. As things had developed it was\r\nimpossible for Great Britain to have followed any other policy--adopted,\r\nperhaps, in a moment of rashness, but the consequences had to be accepted.\r\nIt only remained to do the best toward mitigating as far as possible the\r\nsufferings of the mass of humanity gathered into the Camps, and this I\r\nmust maintain that the English Government did better than could have been\r\nexpected by any who knew South Africa and the immense difficulties which\r\nbeset the British authorities.\r\n\r\nIt must not be forgotten that when the war began it was looked upon in the\r\nlight of a simple military promenade; and, who knows, it might have been\r\nthat had not the Boers been just as mistaken concerning the intentions of\r\nEngland in respect of them as England was in regard to the Boer military\r\nstrength and power of resistance. One must take into account that for the\r\nfew years preceding the war, and especially since the fatal Jameson Raid,\r\nthe whole of the Dutch population of the Transvaal and of the Orange Free\r\nState, as well as that of Cape Colony, was persuaded that England had made\r\nup its mind to destroy it and to give up their country, as well as their\r\npersons, into the absolute power of the millionaires who ruled the Rand.\r\nOn their side the millionaires openly declared that the mines were their\r\npersonal property, and that England was going to war to give the Rand to\r\nthem, and thereafter they were to rule this new possession without any\r\ninterference from anyone in the world, not even that of England. Such a\r\nstate of things was absolutely abnormal, and one can but wonder how ideas\r\nof the kind could have obtained credence. But, strange as it may seem, it\r\nis an indisputable fact that the opinion was prevalent all over South\r\nAfrica that the Rand was to be annexed to the British Empire just in the\r\nsame way as Rhodesia had been and under the same conditions. Everyone in\r\nSouth Africa knew that the so-called conquest of the domain of King\r\nLobengula had been effected only because it had been supposed that it was\r\nas rich in gold and diamonds as the Transvaal.\r\n\r\nWhen Rhodes had taken possession of the vast expanse of territory which\r\nwas to receive his name, the fortune-seekers who had followed in his\r\nfootsteps had high anticipations of speedy riches, and came in time to\r\nconsider that they had a right to obtain that which they had come to look\r\nfor. These victims of money-hunger made Rhodes personally responsible for\r\nthe disappointments which their greed and unhealthy appetites encountered\r\nwhen at last they were forced to the conclusion that Rhodesia was a land\r\nbarren of gold. In time, perhaps, and at enormous expense, it might be\r\ndeveloped for the purpose of cattle breeding, but gold and diamonds either\r\ndid not exist or could only be found in such small quantities that it was\r\nnot worth while looking for them.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this realisation, Rhodes found himself confronted by all\r\nthese followers, who loudly clamoured around him their indignation at\r\nhaving believed in his assertions. What wonder, therefore, that the\r\nthoughts of these people turned toward the possibility of diverting the\r\ntreasures of the Transvaal into their own direction. Rhodes was brought\r\ninto contact with the idea that it was necessary to subdue President\r\nKruger. With a man of Rhodes' impulsive character to begin wishing for a\r\nthing was sufficient to make him resort to every means at his disposal to\r\nobtain it. The Boer War was the work of the Rhodesian party, and long\r\nbefore it broke out it was expected, spoken of, and considered not only by\r\nthe Transvaal Government, but also by the Burghers, who, having many\r\nopportunities of visiting the Cape as well as Rhodesia, had there heard\r\nexpression of the determination of the South African League, and of those\r\nwho called themselves followers and partisans of Rhodes, to get hold of\r\nthe Rand, at the head of which, as an inevitable necessity, should be the\r\nColossus himself. No denial of these plans ever came from Rhodes. By his\r\nattitude, even when relations between London and Pretoria were excellent,\r\nhe gave encouragement to the people who were making all kinds of\r\nspeculations as to what should happen when the Transvaal became a Crown\r\nColony.\r\n\r\nThe idea of a South African Federation had not at that time taken hold of\r\npublic opinion, and, if Rhodes became its partisan later on, it was only\r\nafter he had realised that the British Cabinet would never consent to put\r\nJohannesburg on the same footing as Bulawayo and Bechuanaland. Too large\r\nand important interests were at stake for Downing Street to look with\r\nfavourable eyes on the Rand becoming only one vast commercial concern. A\r\nline had to be drawn, but, unfortunately, the precise demarcation was not\r\nconveyed energetically enough from London. On the other hand, Cecil\r\nRhodes, as well as his friends and advisers, did not foresee that a war\r\nwould not put them in power at the Transvaal, but would give that country\r\nto the Empire to rule, to use its riches and resources for the good of the\r\ncommunity at large.\r\n\r\nThe saddest feature of the South African episode was its sordidness. This\r\nrobbed it of every dignity and destroyed every sympathy of those who\r\nlooked at it impartially or from another point of view than that of\r\npounds, shillings and pence. England has been cruelly abused for its\r\nconduct in South Africa, and abused most unjustly. Had that feeling of\r\ntrust in the justice and in the straightforwardness of Great Britain only\r\nexisted in the Dark Continent, as it did in the other Colonies and\r\nelsewhere, it would have proved the best solution to all the entangled\r\nquestions which divided the Transvaal Republic from the Mother Country by\r\nreason of its manner of looking at the exploitation of the gold mines. On\r\nits side too, perhaps, England might have been brought to consider the\r\nBoers in a different light had she disbelieved a handful of people who had\r\nevery interest in the world to mislead her and to keep her badly informed\r\nas to the truth of the situation.\r\n\r\nWhen war broke out it was not easy for the Command to come at once to a\r\nsane appreciation of the situation, and, unfortunately for all the parties\r\nconcerned, the unjust prejudices which existed in South Africa against Sir\r\nAlfred Milner had to a certain extent tinctured the minds of people at\r\nhome, exercising no small influence on the men who ought to have helped\r\nthe High Commissioner to carry through his plans for the settlement of the\r\nsituation subsequently to the war. The old saying, \"Calumniate,\r\ncalumniate, something will always remain after it,\" was never truer than\r\nin the case of this eminent statesman.\r\n\r\nIt took some time for matters to be put on a sound footing, and before\r\nthis actually occurred many mistakes had been made, neither easy to\r\nrectify nor possible to explain. Foremost among them was this question of\r\nthe Concentration Camps. Not even the protestations of the women who\r\nsubsequently went to the Cape and to the Transvaal to report officially on\r\nthe question were considered sufficient to dissipate the prejudices which\r\nhad arisen on this unfortunate question. The best reply that was made to\r\nMiss Hobhouse, and to the lack of prudence which spoiled her good\r\nintentions, was a letter which Mrs. Henry Fawcett addressed to the\r\n_Westminster Gazette_. In clear, lucid diction this letter re-established\r\nfacts on their basis of reality, and explained with self-respect and\r\nself-control the inner details of a situation which the malcontents had\r\nnot given themselves the trouble to examine.\r\n\r\n\"First,\" says this forceful document, \"I would note Miss Hobhouse's\r\nfrequent acknowledgments that the various authorities were doing their\r\nbest to make the conditions of Camp life as little intolerable as\r\npossible. The opening sentence of her report is, 'January 22.--I had a\r\nsplendid truck given me at Cape Town through the kind co-operation of Sir\r\nAlfred Milner--a large double-covered one, capable of holding twelve\r\ntons.' In other places she refers to the help given to her by various\r\nofficials. The commandant at Aliwal North had ordered £150 worth of\r\nclothing, and had distributed it; she undertook to forward some of it. At\r\nSpringfontein 'the commandant was a kind man, and willing to help both the\r\npeople and me as far as possible.' Other similar quotations might be made.\r\nMiss Hobhouse acknowledges that the Government recognise that they are\r\nresponsible for providing clothes, and she appears rather to deprecate the\r\nmaking and sending of further supplies from England. I will quote her\r\nexact words on this point. The italics are mine. 'The demand for clothing\r\nis so huge that it is hopeless to think that the private charity of\r\nEngland and Colonial working parties combined can effectually cope with\r\nit. _The Government recognise that they must provide necessary clothes,_\r\nand I think we all agree that, having brought these people into this\r\nposition, it is their duty to do so. _It is, of course, a question for\r\nEnglish folk to decide how long they like to go on making and sending\r\nclothes._ There is no doubt they are immensely appreciated; besides, they\r\nare mostly made up, which the Government clothing won't be.' Miss Hobhouse\r\nsays that many of the women in the Camp at Aliwal North had brought their\r\nsewing machines. If they were set to work to make clothes it might serve a\r\ndouble purpose of giving them occupation and the power of earning a little\r\nmoney, and it would also ensure the clothes being made sufficiently large.\r\nMiss Hobhouse says people in England have very incorrect notions of the\r\nmagnificent proportions of the Boer women. Blouses which were sent from\r\nEngland intended for women could only be worn by girls of twelve and\r\nfourteen; they were much too small for the well-developed Boer maiden, who\r\nis really a fine creature. Could a woman's out-out size be procured? It\r\nmust be remembered that when Miss Hobhouse saw the Camps for the first\r\ntime it was in January, the hottest month in the South African year; the\r\ndifficulty of getting supplies along a single line of rail, often broken\r\nby the enemy, was very great. The worst of the Camps she saw was at\r\nBloemfontein, and the worst features of this worst Camp were:\r\n\r\n\"1. Water supply was bad.\r\n\r\n\"2. Fuel was very scarce.\r\n\r\n\"3. Milk was very scarce.\r\n\r\n\"4. Soap was not to be had.\r\n\r\n\"5. Insufficient supply of trained nurses.\r\n\r\n\"6. Insufficient supply of civilian doctors.\r\n\r\n\"7. No ministers of religion.\r\n\r\n\"8. No schools for children.\r\n\r\n\"9. Exorbitant prices were demanded in the shops.\r\n\r\n\"10. Parents had been separated from their children.\r\n\r\n\"Within the Report itself, either in footnotes or in the main body of the\r\nReport, Miss Hobhouse mentions that active steps had already been taken to\r\nremedy these evils. Tanks had been ordered to boil all the water. She left\r\nmoney to buy another, and supplied every family with a pan to hold boiled\r\nwater. Soap was given out with the rations. 'Moreover, the Dutch are so\r\nvery full of resources and so clever they can make their own soap with fat\r\nand soda.' The milk supply was augmented; during the drought fifty cows\r\nonly yielded four buckets of milk daily. 'After the rains the milk supply\r\nwas better.' An additional supply of nurses were on their way. 'The Sister\r\nhad done splendid work in her domain battling against incessant\r\ndifficulties ... and to crown the work she has had the task of training\r\nBoer girls to nurse under her guidance.'\r\n\r\n\"Ministers of religion are in residence, and schools under Mr. E.B.\r\nSargant, the Educational Commissioner, are open for boys and girls.\r\nChildren have been reunited to parents, except that some girls, through\r\nMiss Hobhouse's kind efforts, have been moved away from the Camps\r\naltogether into boarding schools. Even in this Bloemfontein Camp,\r\nnotwithstanding all that Miss Hobhouse says of the absence of soap and the\r\nscarcity of water, she is able to write: 'All the tents I have been in are\r\nexquisitely neat and clean, except two, and they are ordinary.' Another\r\nimportant admission about this Camp is to be found in the last sentence of\r\nthe account of Miss Hobhouse's second visit to Bloemfontein. She describes\r\nthe iron huts which have been erected there at a cost of £2,500, and says:\r\n'It is so strange to think that every tent contains a family, and every\r\nfamily is in trouble--loss behind, poverty in front, privation and death\r\nin the present--but they have agreed to be cheerful and make the best of\r\nit all.'\r\n\r\n\"There can be no doubt that the sweeping together of about 68,000 men,\r\nwomen and children into these Camps must have been attended by great\r\nsuffering and misery, and if they are courageously borne it is greatly to\r\nthe credit of the sufferers. The questions the public will ask, and will\r\nbe justified in asking, are:\r\n\r\n\"1. Was the creation of these Camps necessary from the military point of\r\nview?\r\n\r\n\"2. Are our officials exerting themselves to make the conditions of the\r\nCamps as little oppressive as possible?\r\n\r\n\"3. Ought the public at home to supplement the efforts of the officials,\r\nand supply additional comforts and luxuries?\r\n\r\n\"The reply to the first question can only be given by the military\r\nauthorities, and they have answered it in the affirmative. Put briefly,\r\ntheir statement is that the farms on the veldt were being used by small\r\ncommandoes of the enemy as storehouses for food, arms and ammunition; and,\r\nabove all, they have been centres for supplying false information to our\r\nmen about the movements of the enemy, and correct information to the enemy\r\nabout the movements of the British. No one blames the Boer women on the\r\nfarms for this; they have taken an active part on behalf of their own\r\npeople in the war, and they glory in the fact. But no one can take part in\r\nwar without sharing in its risks, and the formation of the Concentration\r\nCamps is part of the fortune of war. In this spirit 'they have agreed,' as\r\nMiss Hobhouse says, 'to be cheerful and make the best of it.'\r\n\r\n\"The second question--'Are our officials exerting themselves to make the\r\nCamps as little oppressive as possible?'--can also be answered in the\r\naffirmative, judging from the evidence supplied by Miss Hobhouse herself.\r\nThis does not imply that at the date of Miss Hobhouse's visit, or at any\r\ntime, there were not matters capable of improvement. But it is confessed\r\neven by hostile witnesses that the Government had a very difficult task,\r\nand that its officials were applying themselves to grapple with it with\r\nenergy, kindness and goodwill. Miss Hobhouse complains again and again of\r\nthe difficulty of procuring soap. May I quote, as throwing light upon the\r\nfact that the Boer women were no worse off than the English themselves,\r\nthat Miss Brooke-Hunt, who was in Pretoria to organise soldiers'\r\ninstitutes a few months earlier than Miss Hobhouse was at Bloemfontein,\r\nsays in her interesting book, 'A Woman's Memories of the War': 'Captain\r\n---- presented me with a piece of Sunlight soap, an act of generosity I\r\ndid not fully appreciate till I found that soap could not be bought for\r\nlove or money in the town.' A Boer woman of the working-class said to Miss\r\nBrooke-Hunt: 'You English are different from what I thought. They told us\r\nthat if your soldiers got inside Pretoria they would rob us of everything,\r\nburn our houses, and treat us cruelly; but they have all been kind and\r\nrespectable. It seems a pity we did not know this before.' Miss Hobhouse\r\nsupplies some rather similar testimony. In her Report she says: 'The\r\nMafeking Camp folk were very surprised to hear that English women cared a\r\nrap about them or their suffering. It has done them a lot of good to hear\r\nthat real sympathy is felt for them at home, and I am so glad I fought my\r\nway here, if only for that reason.'\r\n\r\n\"In what particular way Miss Hobhouse had to fight her way to the Camps\r\ndoes not appear, for she acknowledges the kindness of Lord Kitchener and\r\nLord Milner in enabling her to visit them; we must therefore suppose that\r\nthey provided her with a pass. But the sentence just quoted is enough in\r\nitself to furnish the answer to the third question--'Is it right for the\r\npublic at home to supplement by gifts of additional comforts and luxuries\r\nthe efforts of our officials to make Camp life as little intolerable as\r\npossible?' All kinds of fables have been told to the Boer men and women of\r\nthe brutality and ferocity of the British. Let them learn by practical\r\nexperience, as many of them have learnt already, that the British soldier\r\nis gentle and generous, and that his women-folk at home are ready to do\r\nall in their power to alleviate the sufferings of the innocent victims of\r\nthe war. I know it will be said, 'Let us attend to the suffering loyalists\r\nfirst.' It is a very proper sentiment, and if British generosity were\r\nlimited to the gift of a certain definite amount in money or in kind, I\r\nwould be the first to say, 'Charity begins at home, and our people must\r\ncome first.' But British generosity is not of this strictly measured kind.\r\nBy all means let us help the loyal sufferers by the war; but let us also\r\nhelp the women and children of those who have fought against us, not with\r\nany ulterior political motive, but simply because they have suffered and\r\nare bound to suffer much, and wounded hearts are soothed and healed by\r\nkindness.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Rowntree has spoken quite publicly of the deep impression made on the\r\nBoer women by the kindness shown them by our men. One said she would be\r\nalways glad to shake hands with a British soldier; it was because of the\r\nkindly devices they had invented to make over their own rations to the\r\nwomen and children during the long journey when all were suffering from\r\nsevere privations. Another Boer girl, referring to an act of kindness\r\nshown her by a British officer, remarked quietly: 'When there is so much\r\nto make the heart ache it is well to remember deeds of kindness.' The more\r\nwe multiply deeds of kindness between Boer and Briton in South Africa, the\r\nbetter for the future of the two races, who, we hope, will one day fuse\r\ninto a united nation under the British flag.\"\r\n\r\nI hope the reader will forgive me for having quoted in such abundance from\r\nMrs. Fawcett's letter, but it has seemed to me that this plain,\r\nunprejudiced and unsophisticated report, on a subject which could not but\r\nhave been viewed with deep sorrow by every enlightened person in England,\r\ngoes far to remove the doubts that might still linger in the minds of\r\ncertain people ignorant of the real conditions of existence in South\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\nA point insufficiently realised in regard to South African affairs is the\r\nmanner in which individuals comparatively devoid of education, and with\r\nonly a hazy notion of politics, contrived to be taken into serious\r\nconsideration not only by those who visited South Africa, but by a certain\r\nsection of English society at home, and also in a more restricted measure\r\nby people at the Cape and in the Transvaal who had risen. These people\r\nprofessed to understand local politics better than the British\r\nauthorities, and expected the officials, as well as public opinion in\r\nGreat Britain, to adopt their advice, and to recognise their right to\r\nbring forward claims which they were always eager to prosecute.\r\nUnfortunately they had friends everywhere, to whom they confided their\r\nregrets that the British Government understood so very little the\r\nnecessities of the moment. As these malcontents were just back from the\r\nRand, there were plenty of people in Cape Town, and especially in Port\r\nElizabeth, Grahamstown, and other English cities in Cape Colony, ready to\r\nlisten to them, and to be influenced by the energetic tone in which they\r\ndeclared that the Boers were being helped all along by Dutch Colonials who\r\nwere doing their best to betray the British.\r\n\r\nIn reality, matters were absolutely different, and those who harmed\r\nEngland the most at that time were precisely the people who proclaimed\r\nthat they, and they alone, were loyal to her, and knew what was necessary\r\nand essential to her interests and to her future at the Cape of Good Hope\r\nand the Rand. Foremost amongst them were the adherents of Rhodes, and this\r\nfact will always cling to his memory--most unfortunately and most\r\nunjustly, I hasten to say, because had he been left absolutely free to do\r\nwhat he liked, it is probable he would have been the first to get rid of\r\nthese encumbrances, whose interferences could only sow animosity where\r\nkindness and good will ought to have been put forward. Cecil Rhodes wanted\r\nto have the last and definite word to say in the matter of a settlement of\r\nthe South African difficulties, and as no one seemed willing to allow him\r\nto utter it, he thought that he would contrive to attain his wishes on the\r\nsubject by seeming to support the exaggerations of his followers. Yet, at\r\nthe same time, he had the leaders of the Dutch party approached with a\r\nview of inducing them to appeal to him to put himself at their head.\r\n\r\nThis double game, which while it lasted constituted one of the most\r\ncurious episodes in a series of events of which every detail was\r\ninteresting, I shall refer to later in more detail, but before doing so\r\nmust touch upon another, and perhaps just as instructive, question--the\r\nso-called refugees, whose misfortunes and subsequent arrogance caused so\r\nmany anxious hours to Sir Alfred Milner during his tenure of office at the\r\nCape and later on in Pretoria.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nIN FLIGHT FROM THE RAND\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest difficulties with which the Imperial Government found\r\nthemselves confronted when relations between Great Britain and the\r\nTransvaal became strained was the influx of refugees who at the first hint\r\nof impending trouble left Johannesburg and the Rand, and flocked to Cape\r\nTown.\r\n\r\nThe greater number were aliens. From Russia in particular they had flocked\r\nto the Transvaal when they heard of its treasures. Adventurers from other\r\nparts of Europe, with a sprinkling of remittance men, also deserted\r\nJohannesburg. Only the few were real English residents who, from the time\r\nthe Rand had begun to develop, had been living and toiling there in order\r\nto win sufficient for the maintenance of their families. All this mass of\r\nhumanity, which passed unnoticed when scattered over wide areas in the\r\nvicinity of Pretoria or Johannesburg, had lived for many years in the\r\nexpectation of the day when the power of the Transvaal Republic would be\r\nbroken. They had discounted it perhaps more than they should have done had\r\nthe dictates of prudence been allowed to take the lead against the wishes\r\nof their hearts.\r\n\r\nWhen war became imminent the big mining houses considered it wiser to\r\nclose their offices and mines, and for these unfortunate beings, deprived\r\nof their means of existence, the position became truly a lamentable one.\r\nThey could not very well remain where they were, because the Burghers, who\r\nhad never taken kindly to them, made no secret of their hostility, and\r\ngave them to understand very clearly that as soon as war had been declared\r\nthey would simply turn them out without warning and confiscate their\r\nproperty. Prudence advised no delay, and the consequence was that,\r\nbeginning with the month of August, and, indeed, the very first days which\r\nfollowed upon the failure of the Bloemfontein Conference, a stream of\r\npeople from the Transvaal began migrating toward Cape Colony, which was\r\nsupposed to be the place where their sufferings would find a measure of\r\nrelief that they vainly imagined would prove adequate to their needs. At\r\nthe Cape, strangely enough, no one had ever given a thought to the\r\npossibility of such a thing happening. In consequence, the public were\r\nsurprised by this persisting stream of humanity which was being poured\r\ninto the Colony; the authorities, too, began to feel a despair as to what\r\ncould be done. It is no exaggeration to say that for months many hundreds\r\nof people arrived daily from the north, and that so long as communications\r\nwere kept open they continued to do so.\r\n\r\nAt first the refugees inundated the lodging-houses in Cape Town, but these\r\nsoon being full to overflowing, some other means had to be devised to\r\nhouse and feed them. Committees were formed, with whom the Government\r\nofficials in the Colony worked with great zeal and considerable success\r\ntoward alleviating the misery with which they found themselves confronted\r\nin such an unexpected manner. The Municipal Council, the various religious\r\ncommunities, the Medical men--one and all applied themselves to relief\r\nmeasures, even though they could not comprehend the reason of the blind\r\nrush to the Cape. Nor, in the main, could the refugees explain more\r\nlucidly than the one phrase which could, be heard on all sides, no matter\r\nwhat might have been the social position: \"We had to go away because we\r\ndid not feel safe on the Rand.\" In many cases it would have been far\r\nnearer to the truth to say that they had to go because they could no\r\nlonger lead the happy-go-lucky existence they had been used to.\r\n\r\nThe most to be pitied among these people were most certainly the Polish\r\nJews, who originally had been expelled from Russia, and had come to seek\r\ntheir fortunes at Johannesburg. They had absolutely no one to whom they\r\ncould apply, and, what was sadder still, no claim on anyone; on the\r\nEnglish Government least of all. One could see them huddling together on\r\nthe platform of Cape Town railway station, surrounded by bundles of rags\r\nwhich constituted the whole of their earthly belongings, not knowing at\r\nall what to do, or where to go to. Of course they were looked after,\r\nbecause English charity has never stopped before differences of race and\r\ncreed, but still it was impossible to deny that their constantly\r\nincreasing number added considerably to the difficulties of the situation.\r\n\r\nA Jewish Committee headed by the Chief Rabbi of Cape Town, the Rev. Dr.\r\nBender, worked indefatigably toward the relief of these unfortunate\r\ncreatures, and did wonders. A considerable number were sent to Europe, but\r\na good many elected to remain where they were, and had to be provided for\r\nin some way till work could be found for them, which would at least allow\r\nthem to exist without being entirely dependent on public charity. Among\r\nthe aliens who showed a desire to remain in South Africa were many in\r\npossession of resources of their own; but they carefully concealed the\r\nfact, as, upon whatever it amounted to, they counted to rebuild their\r\nfortunes when Britain became sole and absolute mistress on the Rand.\r\n\r\nThe most dangerous element in the situation was that group of easygoing\r\nloafers who lived on the fringe of finance and picked up a living by doing\r\nthe odd things needed by the bigger speculators. When things began to be\r\ncritical, these idlers were unable to make money without working, and\r\nwhile prating of their patriotism, made the British Government responsible\r\nfor their present state of penury. These men had some kind of instruction,\r\nif not education, and pretended they understood all about politics, the\r\ngovernment of nations, and last, but not least, the conduct of the war.\r\nTheir free talk, inflamed with an enthusiasm got up for the occasion, gave\r\nto the stranger an entirely incorrect idea of the position, and was\r\ncalculated to give rise to sharp and absolutely undeserved criticisms\r\nconcerning the conduct of the administration at home, and of the\r\nauthorities in the Colony. They also fomented hatred and spite between the\r\nEnglish and the Dutch.\r\n\r\nThe harm done by these people, at a moment when the efforts of the whole\r\ncommunity ought to have been directed toward allaying race hatred, and\r\nsmoothing down the differences which had arisen between the two white\r\nsections of the population, is almost impossible of realisation for one\r\nwho was not in South Africa at the time, and who could not watch the slow\r\nand gradual growth of the atmosphere of lies and calumny which gradually\r\ndivided like a crevasse the very people who, in unison, might have\r\ncontributed more than anything else to bring the war to a close. One must\r\nnot forget that among these refugees who poisoned the minds of their\r\nneighbours with foundationless tales of horror, there were people who one\r\nmight have expected to display sound judgment in their appreciation of the\r\nsituation, and whose relatively long sojourn in South Africa entitled them\r\nto be heard by those who found themselves for the first time in that\r\ncountry. They were mostly men who could talk well, even eloquently; and\r\nthey discussed with such apparent knowledge all the circumstances which,\r\naccording to them, had brought about the war, that it was next to\r\nimpossible for the new-comers not to be impressed by their language--it\r\nseemed bubbling over with the most intense patriotism.\r\n\r\nThe observer must take into account that among these people there happened\r\nto be a good many who, as the war went on, enrolled themselves in the\r\nvarious Volunteer Corps which were formed. These gave the benefit of their\r\nexperience to the British officers, who relied on the knowledge and\r\nperception of their informants because of themselves, especially during\r\nthe first months which followed upon their landing, they could not come to\r\na clearly focused, impartial judgment of the difficulties with which they\r\nfound their efforts confronted. One must also remember that these officers\r\nwere mostly quite young men, full of enthusiasm, who flamed up whenever\r\nthe word rebellion was mentioned in their presence, and who, having\r\narrived in South Africa with the firm determination to win the war at all\r\ncosts, must not be blamed if in some cases they allowed their minds to be\r\npoisoned by those who painted the plight of the country in such a\r\nlugubrious tint. If, therefore, acts of what appeared to be cruelty were\r\ncommitted by these officers, it would be very wrong to make them alone\r\nresponsible, because they were mostly done out of a spirit of self-defence\r\nagainst an enemy whom they believed to be totally different from what he\r\nwas in reality, and who if only he had not been exasperated, would have\r\nproved of better and healthier stuff than, superficially, his acts seemed\r\nto indicate.\r\n\r\nThere was still another class of refugee, composed of what I would call\r\nthe rich elements of the Rand: the financiers, directors of companies;\r\nmanagers and engineers of the different concerns to which Kimberley and\r\nJohannesburg owed their celebrity. From the very first these rightly\r\nweighed up the situation, and had been determined to secure all the\r\nadvantages which it held for anyone who gave himself the trouble to\r\nexamine it rationally. They came to Cape Town under the pretence of\r\nputting their families out of harm's way, but in reality because they\r\nwanted to be able to watch the development of the situation at its centre.\r\nThey hired houses at exorbitant prices in Cape Town itself, or the\r\nsuburbs, and lived the same kind of hospitable existence which had been\r\ntheirs in Johannesburg. Their intention was to be at hand at the\r\nsettlement, to put in their word when the question of the different\r\nfinancial interests with which they were connected would crop up--as it\r\nwas bound to do.\r\n\r\nThe well-to-do executive class forming the last group had the greatest\r\ncause to feel alarmed at the consequences which might follow upon the war.\r\nAlthough they hoped that they would be able to maintain themselves on the\r\nRand in the same important positions which they had occupied previous to\r\nthe war, yet they had enough common sense to understand that they would\r\nnot be allowed under a British administration the same free hand that\r\nPresident Kruger had given, or which they had been able to obtain from him\r\nby means of \"refreshers\" administered in some shape or other. It is true\r\nthat they had always the alternative of retiring from South Africa to Park\r\nLane, whence they would be able to astonish Society, but they preferred to\r\nwait, in case the crash were still delayed for some little time.\r\n\r\nThe big houses, such as Wernher, Beit and Co.--the head of which, at\r\nJohannesburg, was Mr. Fred Eckstein, a man of decided ability, who perhaps\r\nwas one of those in South Africa who had judged the situation with\r\naccuracy--would have preferred to see the crisis delayed. Mr. Eckstein and\r\nother leading people knew very well that sooner or later the Transvaal was\r\nbound to fall to England, and they would have felt quite content to wait\r\nquietly until this event had been accomplished as a matter of course, by\r\nthe force of circumstances, without violence. President Kruger was such an\r\nold man that one could, in a certain sense, discuss the consequences which\r\nhis demise was bound to bring to South Africa. There was no real necessity\r\nto hurry on events, nor would they have been hurried had it not been for\r\nthe efforts of the Rhodesians, whose complaints had had more than anything\r\nelse to do with the failure of the Bloemfontein Conference, and all that\r\nfollowed upon that regrettable incident. It was the Rhodesians, and not\r\nthe big houses of the Rand, who were most eager for the war.\r\n\r\nThe exploitation of Rhodesia, the principal aim of which was the\r\nfoundation of another Kimberley, had turned out to be a disappointment in\r\nthat respect, and there remained nothing but making the best of it,\r\nparticularly as countless companies had been formed all with a distinctly\r\nmineral character to their prospectuses. Now, if the Rand, with all its\r\nwealth and its still unexplored treasures, became an appanage of\r\nKimberley, it would be relatively easy to effect an amalgamation between\r\ngold and diamond mines, which existed there, and the Rhodesian companies.\r\nUnder these conditions it was but natural that despite an intelligent\r\ncomprehension of the situation, Sir Alfred Milner was nevertheless unable\r\nto push forward his own plans in regard to the Transvaal and its aged\r\nPresident, Mr. Kruger.\r\n\r\nThe misfortune of the whole situation, as I have already pointed out, was\r\nthat the men who had attempted to play a high game of politics, in reality\r\nunderstood very little about them, and that instead of thinking of the\r\ninterests of the Empire to which they professed themselves to be so deeply\r\nattached, they thought in terms of their personal outlook. Rhodes alone of\r\nthose not in official position saw the ultimate aim of all these entangled\r\npolitics. But unfortunately, though he had the capacities and experience\r\nof a statesman, he was not a patient man; indeed, throughout his life he\r\nhad acted like a big spoiled child, to whom must be given at once whatever\r\nhe desires. Too often he acted in the present, marring the future by\r\nthinking only of the immediate success of his plans, and brutally starting\r\nto work, regardless of consequences and of his personal reputation. Though\r\nhis soul was essentially that of a financier and he would ride rough-shod\r\nover those who conducted their business affairs by gentler methods, yet at\r\nthe same time, by a kind of curious contrast, he was always ready, nay,\r\neager, to come to the material help of his neighbour--maybe out of\r\naffection for him; maybe out of that special sort of contempt which makes\r\none sometimes throw a bone to a starving dog one has never seen before.\r\nThe greatest misfortune in Rhodes' life was his faculty, too often applied\r\nupon occasions when it were best suppressed, of seeing the mean and sordid\r\naspects of an action, and of imagining that every man could be bought,\r\nprovided one knew the price. He was so entirely convinced of this latter\r\nfact that it always caused him a kind of impatience he did not even give\r\nhimself the trouble to dissimulate, to find that he had been mistaken.\r\nThis happened to him once or twice in the course of his career.\r\n\r\nThe English party in the Colony regretted until the end of Rhodes' life\r\nthe strange aberration that allowed the Raid, and made him sacrifice his\r\nreputation for the sake of hastening an event which, without his\r\ninterference, would almost surely soon have come to pass. The salient\r\nfeature of the Raid was its terrible stupidity; in that respect it was\r\nworse than a crime, for crime is forgotten, but nothing can efface from\r\nthe memory of the world or the condemnation of history a colossally stupid\r\npolitical blunder.\r\n\r\nAfter the foolish attempt to seize hold of their country, the Boers\r\ndistrusted British honour and British integrity; and doubting the word or\r\npromises of England, they made her responsible for this mistake of Cecil\r\nRhodes. Rhodes, however, refused to recognise the sad fact. The big\r\nmagnates of Johannesburg said that the wisest thing Rhodes could have done\r\nat this critical juncture would have been to go to Europe, there to remain\r\nuntil after the war, thus dissociating himself from the whole question of\r\nthe settlement, instead of intriguing to be entrusted with it.\r\n\r\nThe fact of Cecil Rhodes' absence would have cleared the whole situation,\r\nrelieved Sir Alfred Milner, and given to the Boers a kind of political and\r\nfinancial security that peace would not be subject to the ambitions and\r\nprejudices of their enemies, but concluded with a view to the general\r\ninterests of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nDEALING WITH THE REFUGEES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe refugees were a continual worry and annoyance to the English community\r\nat the Cape. As time went on it became extremely difficult to conciliate\r\nthe differing interests which divided them, and to prevent them from\r\ncommitting foolish or rash acts likely to compromise British prestige in\r\nAfrica. The refugees were for the most boisterous people. They insisted\r\nupon being heard, and expected the whole world to agree with their\r\nconclusions, however unstable these might be. It was absolutely useless to\r\ntalk reason to a refugee; he refused to listen to you, but considered\r\nthat, as he had been--as he would put it--compelled to leave that modern\r\nparadise, the Rand, and to settle at Cape Town, it became the\r\nresponsibility of the inhabitants of Cape Town to maintain him. Table\r\nMountain echoed with the sounds of their vain talk. They considered that\r\nthey were the only people who knew anything about what the English\r\nGovernment ought to do, and who criticised it the most, threatening at\r\nevery moment that they would write to their influential friends--even the\r\npoorest and most obscure had \"influential friends\"--revealing the\r\nabominable way in which English interests were neglected in Cape Colony,\r\nwhere the Government, according to them, only helped the rebels, and\r\nconsidered their wants and requirements in preference to those of their\r\nown people.\r\n\r\nAt first, when they were not known as they deserved to be, some persons\r\nfresh from the Mother Country, to whom South African morals and intrigues\r\nwere unknown, took to heart the position as well as the complaints of\r\nthose refugees. Hearing them continually mention cases in which rebel\r\nDutch had, in this way or that, shown their want of allegiance to the\r\nBritish Government, conclusions were jumped at that there must exist a\r\nreason for these recriminations and allegations, and that British\r\nofficials were in reality too anxious to conciliate the anti-English\r\nelements in the Colony, to the detriment of the loyalists, whose feelings\r\nof patriotism they considered, as a matter of course, required no reward\r\nand scarcely any encouragement. These people, unequipped with the truth,\r\ntook up with a warmth which it certainly did not deserve the cause of\r\nthese loyalists, sought their advice, and formed a totally wrong and even\r\nabsurd opinion both as to South African politics and the conduct of the\r\nrepresentatives of the Queen in Cape Town.\r\n\r\nAll the misrepresentation and misunderstanding which took place\r\nincreasingly, led to animosity on the part of the Dutch. Rightly or\r\nwrongly, it was taken as a matter of course that Rhodes favoured the idea\r\nof a total annihilation of the Cape Dutch. And as he was considered a kind\r\nof demigod by so many the idea was widely circulated, and became at last\r\ndeeply rooted in the minds of most of the white population of South\r\nAfrica, who, without being able to say why, considered it in consequence a\r\npart of its duty to exaggerate in the direction of advocating severity\r\ntoward the Dutch. This did not contribute to smoothen matters, and it grew\r\ninto a very real danger, inimical to the conclusion of an honourable and\r\npermanent peace. Federation, which at one time had been ardently wished\r\nfor almost everywhere, became a new cause for anxiety as soon as it was\r\nknown that Rhodes was in favour of it. People fancied that his ambitions\r\nlay in the direction of a kind of dictatorship exercised by himself over\r\nthe whole of South Africa, a dictatorship which would make him in effect\r\nmaster of the country.\r\n\r\nThis, however, was the last thing which the financiers on the Rand wished.\r\nIndeed, they became quite alarmed at the thought that it might become\r\npossible, and hastened to explain to Sir Alfred Milner the peril which\r\nsuch a thing, if it ever happened, would constitute for the community at\r\nlarge. Their constant attendance upon Sir Alfred, however, gave rise to\r\nthe idea that these financiers wanted to have it all their own way with\r\nhim and with the Cabinet at home, and that they meant to confiscate the\r\nTransvaal to their own profit.\r\n\r\nThe presence of the moneyed class at the Cape had also another drawback:\r\nit exasperated the poorer refugees, who could not forgive those who, too,\r\nhad fled the Rand, for having so successfully saved their own belongings\r\nfrom the general ruin and remained rich, when so many of those who had\r\ndirectly or indirectly helped them to acquire their wealth were starving\r\nat their door. In reality the magnates of the Rand spent huge sums in the\r\nrelief of their poorer brethren in misfortune. I know from personal\r\nexperience, having often solicited them in favour of, say, some\r\nunfortunate Russian Jew or a destitute Englishman who had lost all his\r\nearthly belongings through the war. These millionaires, popularly accused\r\nof being so hardhearted, were always ready with their purses to help those\r\nwho appealed to their charity. But the fact that they were able to live in\r\nlarge and luxurious houses whilst so many others were starving in hovels,\r\nthat their wives wore diamonds and pearls, and that they seemed still to\r\nbe able to gratify their every desire, exasperated the multitude of\r\nenvious souls congregated at the Cape.\r\n\r\nA general feeling of uneasiness and of unpleasantness began to weigh on\r\nthe whole atmosphere, and as it was hardly possible for anyone to attack\r\nopenly those who had inexhaustible purses, it became the fashion to say\r\nthat the Dutch were responsible for the general misfortune, and to\r\ndiscover means of causing them unpleasantness.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, as the war went on and showed no signs of subsiding,\r\nthe resources of those who, with perfect confidence in its short duration,\r\nhad left the Rand at a moment's notice, began to dwindle the more quickly\r\ninsomuch as they had not properly economised in the beginning, when the\r\ngeneral idea was prevalent that the English army would enter Pretoria for\r\nthe Christmas following upon the beginning of the war, and that an era of\r\nunlimited prosperity was about to dawn in the Transvaal. I do believe that\r\namong certain circles the idea was rooted that once President Kruger had\r\nbeen expelled from the Rand its mines would become a sort of public\r\nproperty accessible to the whole community at large, and controlled by all\r\nthose who showed any inclination for doing so.\r\n\r\nThe mine owners themselves looked upon the situation from a totally\r\ndifferent point of view. They had gathered far too much experience\r\nconcerning the state of things in South Africa to nurse illusions as to\r\nthe results of a war which was bound to put an end to the corruption of\r\nthe Transvaal Republic. They would have preferred infinitely to let things\r\nremain in the condition into which they had drifted since the Raid,\r\nbecause they understood that a strong British Government would be\r\ninterested in putting an end to the abuses which had transformed the Rand\r\ninto an annexe of the Stock Exchange of almost every European capital.\r\nBut, as the war had broken out, they preferred that it should end, in the\r\nestablishment of a regular administration which could neither be bought\r\nnor persuaded to serve interests in preference to the public. They did not\r\nrelish the possible triumph of a single man, backed by a powerful\r\nfinancial company, with whom they had never lived upon particularly\r\naffectionate terms.\r\n\r\nRather than see South Africa continue under the influence which had\r\nhitherto held it in grip, the magnates preferred to associate themselves\r\nwith Sir Alfred Milner to bring about as soon as possible a Federation of\r\nthe different South African States, where there would be no place for the\r\nambition of a single individual, and where the domination of one financial\r\ncompany would become an impossibility. These magnates were reasonable\r\npeople after all, quite content, after they had taken the cream, to allow\r\nothers to drink. The fever for gold had left them. The fact was that these\r\npeople were not at all anxious to remain at Johannesburg; they preferred\r\nto gather dividends in London rather than to toil in South Africa; the\r\nmerry, merry days of the Rand had come to an end.\r\n\r\nAltogether, indeed, things were beginning to slow down at Johannesburg, in\r\nspite of the fictitious agitation by the Rhodesian party. The war had come\r\nas a relief to everybody, and afforded the magnates the opportunity which\r\nthey had been longing for, to enforce order and economy upon a stringent\r\nscale in their mines and to begin modelling their concerns after a\r\nEuropean fashion, closing the door upon adventurers and cutting off the\r\n\"financial fringe.\" The times when new fields of exploitation were\r\ndiscovered every day were at an end; the treasures which the Transvaal\r\ncontained in the way of precious metals and stones had all been located;\r\nand very few surprises could be expected in that direction. It was time\r\nfor the pioneers to retire upon their laurels and to give to themselves,\r\nas well as to their fortunes, the sedate appearance which they required in\r\norder to be able to take a place amid the most elegant and exclusive\r\nsociety of Europe. Had Rhodes remained alive he would have proved the one\r\ngreat obstacle which the magnates of the Rand would have to take into\r\nconsideration, the disturbing element in a situation that required calm\r\nand quiet.\r\n\r\nIf Cecil Rhodes had been allowed to decide alone as to the best course of\r\naction to pursue he also might have come to the same conclusion as these\r\nmagnates. During those moments when he was alone with his own thoughts and\r\nimpulses he would have realised his duty toward his country. He was\r\nconscious, if others were not, of how utterly he had lost ground in South\r\nAfrica, and he understood that any settlement of the South African\r\ndifficulties could only become permanent if his name were not associated\r\nwith it. This, though undeniable, was a great misfortune, because Rhodes\r\nunderstood so perfectly the art of making the best of every situation, and\r\nusing the resources to hand, that there is no doubt he would have brought\r\nforward a practical solution of the problems which had cropped up on every\r\nside. He might have proved of infinite use to Sir Alfred Milner by his\r\nthorough knowledge of the Dutch character and of the leaders of the Dutch\r\nparty with whom he had worked. But Rhodes was not permitted to decide\r\nalone his line of conduct: there were his supporters to be consulted, his\r\nso-called friends to pacify, the English Jingoes to satisfy, and, most\r\ndifficult of all, the Bond and Dutch party to please. Moreover, he had\r\nbeen indulging in various intrigues of his own, half of which had been\r\nconducted through others and half carried out alone, with what he believed\r\nwas success. In reality they proved to be more of these disappointments he\r\nhad courted with a carelessness which would have appeared almost\r\nincredible if one did not know Cecil Rhodes. The Rhodesians, who with\r\nintention had contrived to compromise him, never left him a moment to his\r\nown thoughts. Without the flatterers who surrounded him Rhodes would\r\nundoubtedly have risen to the height of the situation and frankly and\r\ndisinterestedly put himself at the disposal of the High Commissioner. But\r\nthey managed so to irritate him against the representative of the Queen,\r\nso to anger him against the Dutch party to which he had belonged formerly,\r\nand so to persuade him that everybody was jealous of his successes, his\r\ngenius and his position in South Africa, that it became relatively easy\r\nwith a man of Rhodes' character to make him smart under the sense of\r\nnon-appreciation. Thus goaded, Rhodes acted often without premeditation.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to this impatience and the sense of unsatisfied vanity, the\r\ncoolness and greatness of character of Sir Alfred Milner appeared in\r\nstrong contrast, even though many friends of earlier days, such as W.T.\r\nStead, had turned their backs upon Sir Alfred, accusing him of being the\r\ncause of all the misfortunes which fell upon South Africa. But those who\r\nthus condemned Sir Alfred did not understand the peculiar features of the\r\nsituation. He was credited with inspiring all the harsh measures which\r\nwere employed on occasion by others, measures which he had stridently\r\ndisapproved. Rhodes, in his place, would have killed somebody or destroyed\r\nsomething; Sir Alfred went slowly on with his work, disdained praise as\r\nwell as blame, and looked toward the future. I leave it to the reader to\r\ndecide which of the two showed himself the better patriot.\r\n\r\nThe refugees did not take kindly to the High Commissioner. They had been\r\nfull of illusions concerning the help they fondly imagined he would be\r\nglad to offer them, and when they discovered that, far from taking them to\r\nhis bosom, he discouraged their intention of remaining in Cape Town until\r\nthe end of the war, they grumbled and lied with freedom. Sir Alfred gave\r\nthem very distinctly to understand that they had better not rely on the\r\nBritish Government to feed and clothe them. He said that they would be\r\nwell advised to try to find some work which would allow them to keep\r\nthemselves and their families. But especially he recommended them to go\r\nback to Europe, which, he gravely assured the refugees, was the best place\r\nfor them and their talents. This did not please those refugees who posed\r\nas martyrs of their English patriotism and as victims of the hatred of\r\nKruger and of the Dutch. They expected to be petted and flattered as those\r\nlooked up to as the saviours of the Empire.\r\n\r\nAll the foregoing applies to the middle-class section of the refugees. The\r\npoorer ones grumbled also, but in a different manner, and their irritation\r\nwas rather directed towards the military authorities. As for the\r\nmillionaires, with a few exceptions they also did not care for the High\r\nCommissioner for reasons elaborated in earlier pages of this volume. They\r\neven considered that it would be prejudicial to their interests to allow\r\nRhodes to be upon too intimate terms with Sir Alfred Milner, so they kept\r\na faithful watch at Government House as well as at Groote Schuur, and in\r\ndoing so added to the tension which, up to the last moment of Sir Alfred's\r\ntenure of office at Cape Town, existed between him and Cecil Rhodes. Too\r\ncourteous to tell his redoubtable adversary that he had better mind his\r\nown business, convinced, on the other hand, of the latter's great\r\ncapacities and great patriotism, Sir Alfred was constantly doing all that\r\nhe could do in reason to pacify him. Cecil Rhodes used to make most bitter\r\nand untrue remarks as to the stupidity of the Imperial Government at home\r\nand the incapacity of the men in charge of its armies in South Africa. All\r\nthis was repeated right and left with the usual exaggeration, and reached,\r\nas perhaps was intended, those whom it concerned. The result was that\r\nRhodes found himself tabooed at Pretoria. This he said was due to the\r\ngreat fear which his influence over public opinion in South Africa\r\ninspired among those in command there.\r\n\r\nThe big trouble with Rhodes was that he would never own himself in the\r\nwrong. He quibbled, he hesitated, he postponed replies to questions\r\nsubmitted for his consideration. He wearied everybody around him with his\r\nconstant prevarications in regard to facts he ought to have accepted\r\nwithout flinching if he wanted to regain some of his lost prestige.\r\nUnfortunately for himself and for the cause of peace in South Africa,\r\nRhodes fancied himself immensely clever at \"biding his time,\" as he used\r\nto say. He had ever lurking somewhere in his brain the conviction that one\r\nday the whole situation at Cape Town and Pretoria would become so\r\nentangled that they would have to send for him to beg him as a favour to\r\nstep round and by his magic touch unravel all difficulties. His curious\r\nshyness, his ambition and his vanity battled with each other so long that\r\nthose in authority at last came to the sad conclusion that it was far\r\nbetter to look elsewhere for support in their honest efforts at this\r\nimportant moment in the existence of the African Continent.\r\n\r\nOne last attempt was made. It was backed up by people in London, among\r\nothers by Stead. Stead liked the Great Imperialist as well as one man can\r\nlike another, and had a great and justified confidence in Rhodes' good\r\nheart as well as in that indefinable nobility which manifested itself at\r\ntimes in his strange, wayward nature. Moreover, being gifted with a keen\r\nsense of intuition, the famous journalist realised quite well the immense\r\nwork that might have been done by England through Rhodes had the latter\r\nconsented to sweep away those men around him who were self-interested.\r\n\r\nBut Rhodes preferred to maintain his waiting attitude, whilst trying at\r\nthe same time to accumulate as many proofs as possible that people wanted\r\nhim to assert himself at last. It was the fact that these proofs were\r\ndenied to him at the very minute when he imagined he held them already in\r\nhis hands which led to his suddenly turning once more against the persons\r\nhe had been almost on the point of propitiating. It led him to begin the\r\nmovement for the suspension of the Constitution in Cape Colony, out of\r\nwhich he expected so much and which he intended to use as his principal\r\nweapon against the enemies whom he suspected. That was the last great\r\npolitical venture in his life; it failed, but merciful Providence allowed\r\nhim not to see the utter collapse of his latest house of cards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nUNDER MARTIAL LAW\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may be useful, or at any rate of interest, before I lay my pen aside,\r\nto refer to several things which, at the time they occurred, caused\r\ntorrents of ink to flow both in England and in South Africa.\r\n\r\nThe most important, perhaps, was the application of martial law in Cape\r\nColony. I must repeat that I hold no brief for England. My affection and\r\nadmiration for her does not go to the extent of remaining absolutely blind\r\nto faults she has made in the past, and perhaps is making in the present.\r\nI will not deny that martial law, which, unfortunately, is a necessity in\r\nwartime, was sometimes applied with severity in South Africa. But the\r\nodium rests principally on the loyalists; their spiteful information in\r\nmany cases induced British officers to treat as rebels people who had\r\nnever even dreamt of rebellion.\r\n\r\nIt must not be forgotten that those to whom was entrusted the application\r\nof martial law had perforce to rely on local residents, whom they could\r\nnot possibly suspect of using these officers to satisfy private\r\nanimosities of further private interests. These British officers had never\r\nbeen used to see suspicion reign as master, or to watch a perfectly\r\nconscious twisting of the truth in order to condemn, or even destroy,\r\ninnocent people. A young and probably inexperienced officer sent into a\r\nsmall place like Aliwal North or Uitenhage, for instance, found himself\r\nobliged to rely for information as to the loyalty of the inhabitants on\r\nsome adventurer who, through capitalist influence, had obtained an\r\nexecutive post of some kind. How can one wonder, therefore, that many\r\nregrettable incidents occurred and were immediately made capital of by the\r\nBond party further to embitter the feelings of the Dutch Colonists?\r\n\r\nMany illegal acts were performed under martial law; of some a mention was\r\nmade in the Cape Town Parliament; these, therefore, do not admit of doubt.\r\nFor instance, as Mr. Neethling said in the Legislative Council, a man of\r\nseventy was sent down from Paarl to Beaufort West without being allowed to\r\nsay good-bye to his wife, who was left behind without means of support.\r\nTheir house was searched for papers, but without result, and the man--a\r\nmember of the Afrikander Bond--was sent back, after eighteen months'\r\ndeportation, without any charge having been made against him. He was an\r\nauctioneer and shipping agent, and during his absence his business was\r\nannexed by a rival. One British Colonial, who held office at Stellenbosch,\r\nsaid to one family, without even making an inquiry as to their conduct,\r\n\"You are rebels and I will take your mules\"--which was done. The mules\r\nwere afterwards sold to the Commissariat Department by the man who had\r\ncommandeered them. Is it a matter of astonishment, therefore, that many\r\npeople felt sore and bitter at all that they had undergone and were going\r\nthrough?\r\n\r\nThe administration of martial law in the country districts was absolutely\r\ndeplorable; but when one examines minutely the circumstances of the cases\r\nof injustice about which one could have no doubt, it always emerged that\r\nthese never proceeded from British officers, who, on the contrary,\r\nwherever they found themselves in command, invariably acted with humanity.\r\nThe great mistake of the military authorities was that they had far too\r\nmuch confidence in the Volunteer Corps and those members of it who were\r\nonly anxious to make money out of existing circumstances. Unfortunately,\r\ncertain officers in command of the different corps were extreme Jingoes,\r\nand this distorted their whole outlook. People said at the time of the war\r\nthat some districts of Cape Colony had been turned into hells; some\r\nthings, in truth, called for strong comment. No words could be energetic\r\nenough to describe the manner in which martial law had been\r\nadministered--in the district of Graaf Reinet, for instance. The\r\ncommandants--this justice must be rendered to them--generally meant well,\r\nbut, unfortunately, they were assisted by men of less stable character as\r\nintelligence officers. These, in their turn, unwisely without due inquiry,\r\nengaged subordinates, upon whom they relied for their information. Graaf\r\nReinet people had had to put up with something akin to the Spanish\r\nInquisition. Men there were afraid to speak for fear of espionage, the\r\nmost innocent remarks were distorted by spies recruited from an uncertain\r\nsection of the community. A cattle inspector was deported without trial;\r\nin consequence, the Secretary for Agriculture decided not to employ him\r\nagain; at Graaf Reinet a Colonial intelligence officer constantly declared\r\nin public that it was his intention to drive the people into rebellion;\r\nand so instances could be multiplied.\r\n\r\nThe rebellion was not due to martial law. In Graaf Reinet the prison was\r\nfrequently so crowded, often by men who did not in the least know why,\r\nthat no more sleeping accommodation could be found in it. People were in\r\ndurance vile because they would not join the town guard or defence force.\r\nSo overcrowded the prison became that many persons contracted disease\r\nduring their incarceration.\r\n\r\nFor these sad occurrences the Cape Government was not initially to blame;\r\nmore than once they had remonstrated with the local military authorities,\r\nbut reports concerning their conduct were not allowed to reach the ears of\r\nLord Roberts or of Lord Kitchener. Very often a Hottentot informed against\r\nrespectable citizens to the intelligence officer, and by virtue of that\r\nthey were imprisoned as long as the military authorities deemed fit. When\r\nreleased, a man would sometimes find that his house had been sacked and\r\nhis most valuable property carried away. Persons were deported at an\r\nhour's notice without reasons being given, and thereafter scouts took\r\npossession of their farms and plundered and destroyed everything. Four\r\nwagon-loads of men, women and children were deported from their homes at\r\nBeaufort West. In vain did they ask what they had done. Everybody of the\r\nname of Van Zyl in the district of Graaf Reinet was deported! not a single\r\nperson was left on their farms except those who had driven them out of\r\nthem. And after these had done their work the victims were told, \"Now you\r\ncan return home.\" Some had to walk back many miles to their farms, to find\r\nonly ruin left. Many white people were imprisoned on the mere evidence of\r\ncoloured persons, the reputation for veracity of whom was well known all\r\nover South Africa, and whose evidence against a white man would never have\r\nbeen admitted in any court of law previous to the war.\r\n\r\nIn Uitenhage the same kind of thing occurred. It was sufficient for a Boer\r\ncolumn to pass near the farm of an Afrikander for the latter to be taken\r\nto prison without the slightest investigation. No one knew where the fines\r\npaid went, and certainly a good many of those which were imposed by the\r\ncommanders of the scouts and volunteer corps never reached the coffers of\r\nthe Government.\r\n\r\nAt Cradock, Somerset East, Graaf Reinet and Middelburg people were\r\ncompelled to eradicate prickly pears and do other hard labour simply\r\nbecause they had remained quietly at home, according to the proclamation\r\nissued by Sir Alfred Milner, and refused to join a volunteer corps of some\r\nsort or other. Many magistrates, acting on instructions, forced guiltless\r\npeople to walk a four to six hours' drive under the pretence of subduing\r\ntheir spirits.\r\n\r\nOne case especially was of such a flagrant nature that it illustrates how\r\nfar the malice of these so-called loyalists went and the harm which their\r\nconduct did to the British Government. The act which I am going to relate\r\nwould never have been committed by any genuine English officer, no matter\r\nunder what provocation. There is also a detail which must be noticed: by a\r\nstrange coincidence all the victims of oppression were, with but few\r\nexceptions, men of means, whom, therefore, it was worth while to plunder.\r\nThe story is that a certain Mr. Schoeman, a man of wealth and position\r\nresiding on Vlakteplaats, a farm in the division of Oudtshoorn, received,\r\non August 28th, 1901, a message through his son from the military scouts\r\nwho were stationed at De Jaeger's farm in the neighbourhood, instructing\r\nhim to hand over his horses to their care. No written order from the\r\nCommandant was exhibited to Mr. Schoeman, either at that time or on his\r\nrequest, nor was any evidence adduced at his trial later on to prove that\r\nsuch an order had really been given by an officer administering martial\r\nlaw in the district. Nevertheless, Mr. Schoeman obeyed the order, and on\r\nthe same afternoon sent his horses, three in number, to De Jaeger. The\r\nscouts refused to take his horses, and told them to bring them on the\r\nfollowing morning, Thursday, August 29th. This Schoeman did; on coming to\r\nthe place with them he found that the scouts had left, and was obliged to\r\ntake the animals again back to his farm. On the afternoon of that same day\r\nhe received a message from the scouts, and in reply told them to come and\r\nsee him. He had meanwhile, for safety's sake, sent two horses to be\r\nconcealed away from his stable, and kept one, a stallion, at the\r\nhomestead.\r\n\r\nThe next day, Friday, Boers appeared early in the afternoon. They took the\r\nstallion, and the following day they returned and asked where the other\r\nhorses were. Mr. Schoeman declined to give any information, but they\r\ndiscovered and seized them. Immediately after the Boers had left, Mr.\r\nSchoeman dispatched one of his farm boys named Barry to De Jaeger, the\r\nnearest military post, to report the occurrence. The scouts had, however,\r\ndisappeared, and he learned from De Jaeger that before leaving they had\r\nreceived a report of the presence of the Boers. On the return of Barry,\r\nMr. Schoeman endeavoured to obtain another messenger. Owing to the state\r\nof the country, which was infested with the enemy, his efforts proved\r\nunavailing.\r\n\r\nDuring the next week Mr. Schoeman, with a considerable number of his\r\nneighbours, was ordered to Oudtshoorn. On his arrival he was arrested,\r\nwithout any charge or warrant, and confined for some three months, bail\r\nbeing refused. No preliminary examination was held as provided in the\r\ninstructions on martial law issued May 1st, 1901. On Sunday, December 1st,\r\nit was notified to Mr. Schoeman that he would be tried on the following\r\nday, and the charges were for the first time communicated to him. On\r\nDecember 2nd the court assembled and Mr. Schoeman was charged with three\r\noffences:\r\n\r\n1. For not having handed his horses over to the proper military\r\nauthorities, whereby they fell into the hands of the enemy.\r\n\r\n2. For having been on friendly terms with the enemy.\r\n\r\n3. For having failed to report the presence of the enemy.\r\n\r\nHe was found guilty on the first and last charges and not guilty on the\r\nsecond count, being sentenced to six months' hard labour and to pay a fine\r\nof £500, or to suffer a further term of twelve months' hard labour in lieu\r\nof the fine. The sentence was confirmed, the fine was paid by Mr.\r\nSchoeman, and he underwent the imprisonment for one month with hard labour\r\nand for five months without hard labour, which was remitted upon order\r\nfrom Lord Kitchener, who, without even being fully instructed as to the\r\ncircumstances of the case, of his own accord lightened the terrible\r\nsentence passed upon Mr. Schoeman.\r\n\r\nLater on Mr. Schoeman was cleared of the calumnies that had been the cause\r\nof his suffering. In this case, as in many others, the victim was the\r\nobject of the private vengeance of a man who had had a grudge against him,\r\nand repaid it in that abominable manner.\r\n\r\nOne of the worst mistakes among the many committed during the South\r\nAfrican War was to allow residents to be invested with what was nothing\r\nless than unlimited authority over their fellow-citizens. The British\r\nGovernment, which was made responsible for these acts, would never have\r\ngiven its sanction to any one of them; mostly, it was unaware of the\r\noriginal facts. The English military authorities dealt in absolute good\r\nfaith, which makes the more shameful the conduct of those who wilfully led\r\nthem into error. Their one fault was not to realise that certain\r\nindividuals were not fit to administer martial law. In one particular\r\ndistrict the man in authority seemed to have as the single aim of his life\r\nthe punishment of anyone with Dutch sympathies or of Dutch blood. It was\r\nuseless to appeal to him, because whenever a complaint was brought by an\r\ninhabitant of the district he simply refused to listen to it, and poured a\r\ntorrent of abuse at the head of the bringer. One of his most notorious\r\nactions was the treatment which, by his orders, was inflicted on an old\r\nman who enjoyed the general esteem of both the English and the Dutch\r\ncommunity, a former member of the House of Assembly. His house was\r\nsearched, the floors were taken up, and the whole garden was dug out of\r\nrecognition in a search for documents that might have proved that his son,\r\nor himself, or any other member of his family had been in correspondence\r\nwith the two Republics. All this kind of thing was done on hearsay\r\nevidence, behind which lay personal motives. Had the settlement of the\r\ncountry been left entirely in the hands of Lord Kitchener, nothing\r\napproaching what I have related could have occurred. Unfortunately for all\r\nconcerned, this was precisely the thing which the Rhodesian and other\r\ninterests opposed. Much of the loyalty, about which such a fuss was made\r\nat the Cape, was loyalty to the sovereign in the pocket, and not loyalty\r\nto the Sovereign on the throne. This concern for wealth was seen in many\r\naspects of life in South Africa, and occasionally invaded drastically the\r\nrealm of social well-being. A case in point was the opposition by the\r\nfinancial interests to a tax on brandy. In South Africa drunkenness was\r\none of the worst evils, especially among the coloured race, yet the\r\nrestrictive influence of a tax was withheld. The underlying motive was\r\nnothing but the desire to avoid the tax on diamonds, which every\r\nreasonable person claimed and considered to be a source of revenue of\r\nwhich the Government had no right to deprive itself. While Rhodes lived\r\nthe legislation introduced and maintained by his powerful personality\r\nrevealed the policy of compromise which he always pursued. He was\r\neminently practical and businesslike. He said to the members of the Bond,\r\n\"Don't you tax diamonds and I won't tax dop,\" as the Cape brandy is\r\ncalled. The compact was made and kept in his lifetime.\r\n\r\nWhen Rhodes was dead and a big democratic British element had come into\r\nthe country after the war, those in power began wondering how it was that\r\ndiamonds, which kept in luxury people who did not live in the country and\r\nconsequently had no interest whatever in its prosperity, were not taxed.\r\nThe Ministry presided over by Sir Gordon Sprigg shared this feeling, and\r\nin consequence found itself suddenly forsaken by its adherents of the day\r\nbefore, and the Rhodesian Press in full cry against the Government. Sir\r\nGordon Sprigg was stigmatised as a tool of the Bond and as disloyal to the\r\nEmpire after the fifty years he had worked for it, with rare\r\ndisinterestedness and great integrity. Nevertheless, the Ministry declared\r\nthat, as there existed an absolute necessity for finding new resources to\r\nliquidate the expenses contingent on the war, it would propose a tax on\r\ndiamonds and another one on dop.\r\n\r\nThe exasperation of the Rhodesian party, which was thus roused, was the\r\nprincipal reason why the agitation for the suspension of the Constitution\r\nin Cape Colony was started and pursued so vigorously in spite of the small\r\nchance it had to succeed. His support of this agitation may be called the\r\ndeath-bed effort of Rhodes. When he was no longer alive to lend them his\r\nstrong hand, the Rhodesian party was bound to disperse. They tried in vain\r\nto continue his policy, but all their efforts to do so failed, because\r\nthere was nothing really tangible for them to work upon.\r\n\r\nWith Cecil Rhodes came to an end also what can be called the romantic\r\nperiod of the history of South Africa, that period during which fortunes\r\nwere made and lost in a few days; when new lands were discovered and\r\nconquered with a facility and a recklessness that reminded one of the\r\nMiddle Ages. The war established an equilibrium which but for it would\r\nhave taken years to be reached. It sealed the past and heralded the dawn\r\nof a new day when civilisation was to assert itself, to brush away many\r\nabuses, much cruelty and more injustice. The race hatred which the\r\npersonality of Rhodes had done so much to keep alive, collapsed very\r\nquickly after his death, and as time went on the work done with such\r\nunselfishness and such quiet resolution by Sir Alfred Milner began to bear\r\nfruit. It came gradually to be understood that the future would justify\r\nhis aims.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE RT. HON. SIR JOHN GORDON SPRIGG]\r\n\r\nThe war was one of those colossal crises which shake the foundations of a\r\ncountry and change the feelings of a whole generation of men and women in\r\nregard to each other. Whilst it lasted it roused the worst passions and\r\nshowed up the worst aspects of the character of the people who played a\r\npart in it; but once it was over the false fabric upon which the\r\nanimosities of the day before had been built fell. A serious and more\r\nenlightened appreciation of the events that had brought about the\r\ncataclysm which had cleared the air took the place of the furious outburst\r\nof hatred that had preceded it. People began to realise that it was not\r\npossible, on a continent where Europeans constituted but a small minority,\r\nthat they could give the coloured races a terrible example of disunion and\r\nstrife and still maintain dominance. Both the English and Dutch had at\r\nlast recognised the necessity for working together at the great task of a\r\nFederation of the South African States, which would allow the whole of the\r\nvast Southern Continent to develop itself on a plane of higher progress\r\nunder the protection of the British flag. This Union was conceived many,\r\nmany years earlier by Cecil Rhodes. It was his great spirit that thought\r\nof making into one great nation the agglomeration of small nationalities,\r\nwhite and black, that lay over the veldt and impenetrable forests of South\r\nand Central Africa. For a long space of years Cecil Rhodes was South\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\nSo long as Rhodes lived it would have been impossible for South Africa\r\nto escape the influence of his brain, which was always plotting and\r\nplanning for the future whilst forgetting more often than was healthy or\r\nwise the preoccupations of the present. After the Queen's flag had been\r\nhoisted at Pretoria, Cecil Rhodes alive would have proved an anomaly in\r\nSouth Africa. Cecil Rhodes dead would still retain his position as a\r\ndreamer and a thinker, a man who always pushed forward without heeding the\r\nobstacles, forgetful of aught else but the end he was pursuing, the\r\ncountry which he loved so well, and, what he cared for even more, his own\r\nambition. Men like Rhodes--with all their mistakes to mar their dazzling\r\nsuccesses--cannot be replaced; it is just as difficult to take up their\r\nwork as it is to fill the gap caused by their disappearance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nI have come to the end of what I intended at first to be a book of\r\nrecollections but which has resolved itself into one of impressions. A\r\nmore competent pen than mine will one day write the inner history of this\r\nSouth African War, which by an anomaly of destiny had quite different\r\nresults from those expected. So many things have occurred since it\r\nhappened that the whole sequence of events, including the war, is now\r\nlooked upon by many people as a simple incident in a long story.\r\n\r\nIn reality the episode was something more than that. It was a\r\nmanifestation of the great strength of the British Empire and of the\r\nwonderful spirit of vitality which has carried England triumphantly\r\nthrough crises that would have wrecked any other nation. The incidents\r\nwhich followed the war proved the generosity that lies at the bottom of\r\nthe English character and the grandeur that comes out of it in those grave\r\nmoments when the welfare of a nation appears to be at stake and its rulers\r\nare unable to apply to a succession of evils and dangers the right remedy\r\nto bring about peace and contentment. No other nations possess this\r\nremarkable and distinctive feature. England very wisely refused to notice\r\nthe bitterness which still persisted in the early days after the\r\nconclusion of peace, and devoted her energies to the one immense and\r\nimmediate work of Federation.\r\n\r\nThe colossal work of Union had been conceived in the shape which it was\r\neventually to assume by Sir Alfred Milner, who, after having laid the\r\nfoundations, was patriot enough to allow others to achieve its\r\nconsummation, because he feared the unjust estimate of his character,\r\ndisseminated by interested persons, might compromise the desired object\r\nand far-reaching possibilities of an enterprise which the most sanguine\r\nhad never imagined could be accomplished within so short a space of time.\r\nHe had toiled courageously toward the founding of a new State where the\r\nrights of every white as well as of every coloured man should be respected\r\nand taken into account, and where it would be impossible for a handful of\r\nrich men by the mere power of riches to control the lives and consciences\r\nof others.\r\n\r\nThe time of Sir Alfred Milner's administration was the transitory period\r\nbetween the primitive and the civilised that no nation escapes, and this\r\nperiod Sir Alfred used in working toward the establishment of a strong and\r\nwise government. Whether the one which started its course of existence on\r\nthe day when the Federation of South Africa became an accomplished fact\r\nwas strong and wise it is not for me to say. At least it was a patriotic\r\ngovernment, one which worked sincerely at the abolition of the race hatred\r\nwhich the war had not entirely killed, and also one which recognised that\r\nafter all it was the principle of Imperial government that alone could\r\nbring back prosperity and security to unfortunate and bleeding South\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\nThe war gave to the Empire the loyal support and co-operation of the Dutch\r\npopulation at the Cape and also in the Transvaal, and the fidelity with\r\nwhich General Botha fulfilled his duty toward the Mother Country in the\r\ndifficult moments of 1914 proved the strong link forged in 1902 between\r\nthe British Empire and South Africa. Now that years have passed it is\r\npossible to look with a less passionate eye upon the past and upon the men\r\nwho took a leading part in the events which gave to the British Empire\r\nanother fair dominion. They appear to us as they really were, and we can\r\nmore justly accord them their proper valuation. The personality of Cecil\r\nRhodes will always remain a great one; his merits and his defects will be\r\nreduced to their proper relative proportions, and the atmosphere of\r\nadulation or antagonism which, as the occasion suited, was poured upon\r\nhim, be dissipated by time's clarifying influences. His real work\r\nconsisted in the opening of new sources of wealth and new spheres of\r\nactivity to a whole multitude of his fellow-countrymen, and of giving his\r\nnative land an extension of its dominions in regions it had never\r\npenetrated before Cecil Rhodes' enterprising spirit of adventure and of\r\nconquest sent him into the wilderness of Africa to open a new and\r\nradiating centre of activity and development for his country. The\r\nconception of the Cape to Cairo Railway was one of those projects for\r\nwhich his country will ever remain grateful.\r\n\r\nYes! Rhodes was a great Englishman in spite of his faults, and perhaps on\r\naccount of his faults. Beside the genius of a Darwin or of a Pasteur, the\r\ntalent of a Shakespeare or of a Milton, the science of a Newton or of a\r\nLister, his figure seems a small one indeed, and it is absurd to raise him\r\nto the same level as these truly wonderful men. The fact that the activity\r\nof Cecil Rhodes lay in quite a different direction does not, however,\r\ndiminish the real importance of the work which he did, nor of the services\r\nwhich he rendered to his country. The mistake is to judge him as a\r\nuniversal genius. His genius had a particular bent; it was always directed\r\ntoward one point and one only, that of material advantages to be acquired\r\nfor the nation to which he belonged and of which he was so proud to be the\r\nson. Without him South Africa would possibly have been lost for the\r\nBritish Empire, which owes him most certainly a great debt in that\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nThe years which have gone by since his death have proved that in many\r\nthings Rhodes had been absolutely mistaken. Always he was an attractive,\r\nand at times even a lovable, personality; a noble character marred by\r\nsmall acts, a generous man and an unscrupulous foe; violent in temper,\r\nunjust in his view of facts that displeased him, understanding chiefly his\r\npersonal interests, true to those whom he considered his friends, but\r\nimplacable toward the people whom he himself had wronged. He was a living\r\nenigma to which no one had ever found a solution; because he presented\r\nconstantly new and unexpected sides that appeared suddenly and shattered\r\nthe conclusion to which one had previously arrived.\r\n\r\nIn Europe Rhodes would not only have been impossible, but he would never\r\nhave found the opportunity to give full rein to his faculties of\r\norganisation and of conquest. He knew no obstacles and would admit none in\r\nhis way; he was of the type of Pizarro and of Fernando Cortez, with fewer\r\nprejudices, far more knowledge, and that clear sense of civilisation which\r\nonly an Englishman born and bred amid the traditions of liberty can\r\npossess. But he was lacking in the fine political conception of government\r\nwhich Sir Alfred Milner possessed, and whilst refusing to admit the\r\nthought of compromise in matters where a little yielding to the wishes and\r\ndesires of others might have secured him considerable advantage, he yet\r\nallowed himself to become entangled in intrigues which he denied as soon\r\nas he perceived that they could not be successful, but for which the world\r\nalways condemned and never forgave, and even in some cases despised him.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the great brilliance of his intelligence and the strength\r\nof his mind, Cecil Rhodes will always be found inferior to the present\r\nViscount Milner as a statesman. Rhodes could not and would not wait.\r\nMilner spent his whole existence in waiting, and waited so successfully\r\nthat he lived to see the realisation of the plans which he had made and\r\nwhich so many, even among his friends, had declared to be quite impossible\r\nfor him to realise. Milner, about whose tact and mental greatness so many\r\nfalse notions existed in South Africa as well as elsewhere, had been the\r\none man who had seen clearly the consequences of the war. As he told me\r\none day when we were talking about the regrettable race-hatred which lent\r\nsuch animosity to the struggle: \"It will cease sooner than one thinks.\"\r\n\r\nThe wise administrator, who had studied human nature so closely as he had\r\ndone politics, had based his judgments on the knowledge which he had\r\nacquired of the spirit of colonisation which makes Great Britain so\r\nsuperior to any other nation in the world, and his belief that her\r\nmarvellous spirit of adaptation was bound to make itself felt in South\r\nAfrica as it had elsewhere. Sir Alfred Milner knew that as time went on\r\nthe Afrikanders would realise that their erstwhile enemies had given them\r\nthe position to which they had always aspired, a position which entitled\r\nthem to take a place among the other great nations of the world. He knew,\r\ntoo, that their natural spirit of pride and of vanity would make them\r\ncherish the Empire that had allowed them to realise their ambitions of the\r\npast. Until the war they had been proud of their gold and of their\r\ndiamonds; after the war they would be proud of their country. And by the\r\nconsciousness which would gradually come to them of the advantages which\r\ntheir Federation under the British flag had brought to them they would\r\nbecome also ardent British patriots--blessing the day when, in a passing\r\nfit of insanity, goaded into it by people who had never seen clearly the\r\nsituation, President Kruger had declared war on England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nAfrica, South, charm of, 22\r\n      conquest of, 1\r\n      drunkenness in, 223\r\n      English colonists, 14\r\n      prior to Boer War, 6\r\n      Union of (_see_ Union)\r\n\r\nAfrikander Bond, 86, 99\r\n      and Rhodes, 73, 82, 84\r\n      and Sir A.
