William Pitt_, &c. &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Speaker having read HIS MAJESTY’S MESSAGE, _viz._\r\n\r\n    _GEORGE REX._\r\n\r\n    “His Majesty is persuaded that the unremitting industry with\r\n    which our enemies persevere in their avowed design of effecting\r\n    the Separation of Ireland from this Kingdom, cannot fail to\r\n    engage the particular attention of Parliament; and His Majesty\r\n    recommends it to this House to consider of the most effectual\r\n    means of counteracting and finally defeating this design; and\r\n    he trusts that a review of all the circumstances which have\r\n    recently occurred (joined to the sentiment of mutual affection\r\n    and common interest), will dispose the Parliament of both\r\n    Kingdoms to provide, in the manner which they shall judge most\r\n    expedient, for settling such a complete and final adjustment as\r\n    may best tend to improve and perpetuate a Connection essential\r\n    for their common security, and to augment and consolidate the\r\n    Strength, Power, and Resources of the British Empire.”\r\n\r\n                                                           G. R.\r\n\r\nMr. PITT _rose, and spoke as follows_:\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nWhen I proposed to the House, the last time this subject was before them,\r\nto fix this day for the further consideration of His Majesty’s Message, I\r\ncertainly indulged the hope that the result of a similar communication to\r\nthe Parliament of Ireland would have opened a more favourable Prospect,\r\nthan at present exists, of the speedy accomplishment of a measure which I\r\nthen stated, and which I still consider, to be of the greatest importance\r\nto the power, the stability, and the general welfare of the Empire;\r\nto the immediate interests of both Kingdoms; and more particularly\r\nto the peace, the tranquillity, and the safety of Ireland: in this\r\nhope, I am sorry to say, I have for the present been disappointed, by\r\nthe proceedings of the Irish House of Commons, of which we have been\r\ninformed since this subject was last under consideration.\r\n\r\nI feel and know that the Parliament of Ireland possesses the power,\r\nthe intire competence, on the behalf of that country, alike to accept\r\nor reject a proposition of this nature—a power which I am by no means\r\ninclined to dispute. I see that at the present moment one House\r\nof Parliament in Ireland has expressed a repugnance, even to the\r\nconsideration of this measure. Feeling, Sir, as I have already stated,\r\nthat it is important, not only as it tends to the general prosperity\r\nof the Empire of Great Britain, but (what, under every situation, must\r\nalways be to me an object of the greatest moment) feeling that it was\r\ndesigned and calculated to increase the prosperity and ensure the safety\r\nof Ireland, I must have seen with the deepest regret that, at the very\r\nfirst moment, and before the nature of the measure could be known, it was\r\nso received.\r\n\r\nBut whatever may have been my feelings upon this subject, knowing that\r\nit is the undoubted right of the Legislature of Ireland to reject or to\r\nadopt such measures as may appear to them injurious or beneficial, far be\r\nit from me to speak of its determination in any other terms but those of\r\nrespect. Let it not, therefore, be imagined that I am inclined to press\r\nany sentiment, however calculated it may appear to me to benefit every\r\nmember of the Empire, in any manner which may lead to hostile discussion\r\nbetween two Kingdoms, whose mutual happiness and safety depend upon their\r\nbeing strictly and cordially united. But while I admit and respect the\r\nrights of the Parliament of Ireland, I feel that, as a Member of the\r\nParliament of Great Britain, I also have a Right to exercise, and a Duty\r\nto perform. That Duty is to express, as distinctly as I can, the general\r\nnature and outline of the Plan, which, in my conscience, I think would\r\ntend in the strongest manner to ensure the safety and the happiness of\r\nboth Kingdoms.\r\n\r\nWhile I feel, therefore, that as long as the House of Commons of Ireland\r\nview the subject in the light they do at present, there is no chance of\r\nits adoption, I do not think that I ought on that account to abstain from\r\nsubmitting it to the consideration of this Parliament; on the contrary, I\r\nthink it only the more necessary to explain distinctly the principles of\r\nthe Measure, and to state the grounds upon which it appears to me to be\r\nentitled to the approbation of the Legislature.\r\n\r\nIf Parliament, when it is in possession of the basis upon which this Plan\r\nis founded, and of its general outline, should be of opinion with me,\r\nthat it is founded upon fair, just, and equitable principles, calculated\r\nto produce mutual advantages to the two Kingdoms—if Parliament, I say,\r\nupon full explanation, and after mature deliberation, should be of that\r\nopinion, I should propose that its determination should remain recorded\r\nas that by which the Parliament of Great Britain is ready to abide,\r\nleaving to the Legislature of Ireland to reject or to adopt it hereafter,\r\nupon a full consideration of the subject.\r\n\r\nThere is no man who will deny that in a great question of this nature,\r\ninvolving in it objects which, in the first instance, are more likely to\r\nbe decided upon by passion than by judgment; in a question in which an\r\nhonest but, I must be allowed to say, a mistaken sense of National Pride\r\nis so likely to operate, that much misconstruction and misconception\r\nmust inevitably happen. It therefore becomes the more necessary that\r\nthe intentions of the Government which proposes the Measure, and the\r\nprinciples of the Measure itself, should be distinctly understood.\r\nBut, Sir, in stating that intention and those principles, I look to\r\nsomething more than a mere vindication of Government for having proposed\r\nthe Measure. I do entertain a confidence, even under the apparent\r\ndiscouragement of the opinion expressed by the Irish House of Commons,\r\nthat this Measure is founded upon such clear, such demonstrable grounds\r\nof utility, is so calculated to add to the strength and power of the\r\nEmpire, (in which the safety of Ireland is included, and from which\r\nit never can be separated) and is attended with so many advantages to\r\nIreland in particular, that all that can be necessary for its ultimate\r\nadoption is, that it should be stated distinctly, temperately, and fully,\r\nand that it should be left to the unprejudiced, the dispassionate,\r\nthe sober judgment of the Parliament of Ireland. I wish that those\r\nwhose interests are involved in this measure should have time for its\r\nconsideration—I wish that time should be given to the Landed, to the\r\nMercantile, and Manufacturing Interest, that they should look at it\r\nin all its bearings, and that they should coolly examine and sift the\r\npopular arguments by which it has been opposed, and that then they should\r\ngive their deliberate and final judgment.\r\n\r\nI am the more encouraged in this hope of the ultimate success of this\r\nmeasure, when I see, notwithstanding all the prejudices which it has\r\nexcited, that barely more than one-half of the members that attended\r\nthe House of Commons were adverse to it; and that in the other House of\r\nParliament in Ireland, containing, as it does, so large a portion of the\r\nproperty of that kingdom, it was approved of by a large majority.—When I\r\nhave reason to believe that the sentiments of a large part of the People\r\nof that Country are favourable to it; and that much of the Manufacturing,\r\nand of the Commercial Interest of Ireland are already sensible how much\r\nit is calculated to promote their advantage, I think, when it is more\r\ndeliberately examined, and when it is seen in what temper it is here\r\nproposed and discussed, that it will still terminate in that which can\r\nalone be a fortunate result.\r\n\r\nIt would be vain indeed to hope that a proposition upon which prejudices\r\nare so likely to operate, and which is so liable to misconception, should\r\nbe unanimously approved. But the approbation I hope for is, that of the\r\nParliament of Ireland, and of the intelligent part of the Public of\r\nthat Country. It is with a view to this object that I think it my duty\r\nto bring this measure forward at present; not for the sake of urging\r\nits immediate adoption, but that it may be known and recorded; that the\r\nintention of the British Parliament may be known, in the hope that it\r\nwill produce similar sentiments among our Countrymen in Ireland. With\r\nthis view it is my intention not to go at present into any detailed\r\nstatement of the plan, because should it ultimately be adopted, the\r\nminuter parts must necessarily become the objects of much distinct\r\ndiscussion; but to give such a general statement of the nature of the\r\nmeasure as will enable the House to form a correct judgment upon it.\r\n\r\nI shall therefore, Sir, before I sit down, open to the House a string\r\nof Resolutions, comprising the general heads of this plan. It will\r\nbe necessary for me, for the purpose of discussing those Resolutions\r\nwith regularity and convenience, to move that the House should resolve\r\nitself into a Committee. And I have already stated, that it is not my\r\nintention then to press the Committee to come to an immediate decision\r\nupon the Resolutions; but if, upon full and deliberate examination, the\r\nResolutions which I shall have the honour to propose, and which contain\r\nas much as is necessary for an outline of the plan, shall be approved, my\r\nopinion is, that nothing can contribute more to obviate any doubts and\r\ndissatisfaction which may exist, than that Parliament should adopt those\r\nResolutions, and that it should then humbly lay them at the foot of the\r\nThrone, leaving it to HIS MAJESTY’S wisdom to communicate them to the\r\nParliament of Ireland, whenever circumstances should appear favourable\r\nto such a Measure. I shall therefore, Sir, proceed as shortly as I can\r\nto state to the House the nature, of the Resolutions, and of the Address\r\nwhich I shall propose to accompany them, if it should be the pleasure of\r\nthe House to adopt them.\r\n\r\nHaving now, Sir, explained to the House the mode I mean to pursue, and my\r\nreasons for persisting, under the present circumstances, in submitting\r\nthis Measure to the consideration of Parliament, I will endeavour to\r\nstate the general grounds on which it rests, the general arguments by\r\nwhich it is recommended, and to give a short view of the outline of the\r\nPlan.\r\n\r\nAs to the general principle upon which, the whole of this Measure is\r\nfounded, I am happy to observe, from what passed upon a former occasion,\r\nthat there is not a probability of any difference of opinion. The general\r\nprinciple, to which both sides of the House perfectly acceded, is, that\r\na perpetual Connection between Great Britain and Ireland is essential\r\nto the interests of both. The only Honourable Gentleman who, when this\r\nsubject was before the House on a former day, opposed the consideration\r\nof the Plan altogether, stated, in terms as strong as I could wish,\r\nthe necessity of preserving the strictest Connection between the two\r\nCountries. I most cordially agree with him in that opinion, but I then\r\nstated, that I do not barely wish for the maintenance of that Connection\r\nas tending to add to the general strength of the Empire, but I wish for\r\nthe maintenance of it with a peculiar regard to the local interests of\r\nIreland, with a regard to every thing that can give to Ireland its due\r\nweight and importance, as a great member of the Empire. I wish for it\r\nwith a view of giving to that Country the means of improving all its\r\ngreat natural Resources, and of giving it a full participation of all\r\nthose blessings which this Country so eminently enjoys.\r\n\r\nConsidering the subject in this point of view, and assuming it as a\r\nproposition not to be controverted, that it is the duty of those who wish\r\nto promote the Interest and Prosperity of both Countries, to maintain\r\nthe strongest connection between them, let me ask, what is the situation\r\nof Affairs that has called us to the discussion of this subject? This\r\nvery connection, the necessity of which has been admitted on all hands,\r\nhas been attacked by Foreign Enemies, and by Domestic Traitors. The\r\ndissolution of this connection is the great object of the hostility of\r\nthe common Enemies of both Countries, it is almost the only remaining\r\nhope with which they now continue the contest. Baffled and defeated as\r\nthey have hitherto been, they still retain the hope, they are still\r\nmeditating attempts, to dissolve that connection. In how many instances\r\nalready the defeat of their hostile designs has been turned to the\r\nconfirmation of our Strength and Security, I need not enumerate. God\r\ngrant that in this instance the same favour of Divine Providence, which\r\nhas in so many instances protected this Empire, may again interpose\r\nin our favour, and that the attempts of the Enemy to separate the two\r\nCountries, may tend ultimately to knit them more closely together, to\r\nstrengthen a Connection, the best pledge for the happiness of both, and\r\nso add to that power which forms the chief barrier to the civilized\r\nworld, against the destructive principles, the dangerous projects, and\r\nthe unexampled usurpation of France. This Connection has been attacked\r\nnot only by the avowed Enemies of both Countries, but by internal\r\nTreason, acting in concert with the designs of the Enemy. Internal\r\nTreason, which ingrafted Jacobinism on those diseases which necessarily\r\ngrew out of the State and Condition of Ireland.\r\n\r\nThinking, then, as we all must think, that a close Connection with\r\nIreland is essential to the interests of both Countries, and seeing how\r\nmuch this Connection is attacked, let it not be insinuated that it is\r\nunnecessary, much less improper, at this arduous and important crisis,\r\nto see whether some new arrangements, some fundamental regulations, are\r\nnot necessary, to guard against the threatened danger. The foreign and\r\ndomestic Enemies of these Kingdoms have shewn, that they think this the\r\nvulnerable point in which We may be most successfully attacked; let us\r\nderive advantage, if we can, from the hostility of our Enemies—let us\r\nprofit by the designs of those who, if their conduct displays no true\r\nwisdom, at least possess in an eminent degree that species of wisdom\r\nwhich is calculated for the promotion of mischief. They know upon what\r\nfooting that Connection rests at this moment between the two Countries,\r\nand they feel the most ardent hope, that the two Parliaments will be\r\ninfatuated enough not to render their designs abortive, by fixing that\r\nConnection upon a more solid basis.\r\n\r\nThese circumstances I am sure will not be denied. And if upon other\r\ngrounds we had any doubt, these circumstances alone ought to induce us,\r\ndeliberately and dispassionately, to review the situation of the two\r\nCountries, and to endeavour to find out a proper remedy for an evil,\r\nthe existence of which is but too apparent. It requires but a moment’s\r\nreflection, for any man who has marked the progress of events, to decide\r\nupon the true state and character of this Connection. It is evidently one\r\nwhich does not afford that security which, even in times less dangerous\r\nand less critical than the present, would have been necessary, to enable\r\nthe empire to avail itself of its strength and its resources.\r\n\r\nWhen I last addressed the House on this subject, I stated that the\r\nsettlement, which was made in 1782, so far from deserving the name of a\r\nFinal Adjustment, was one that left the Connection between Great Britain\r\nand Ireland exposed to all the attacks of Party, and all the effects\r\nof accident. That Settlement consisted in the demolition of the System\r\nwhich before held the two Countries together. Let me not be understood as\r\nexpressing any regret at the termination of that System. I disapproved\r\nof it, because I thought it was one unworthy the liberality of Great\r\nBritain, and injurious to the interests of Ireland. But to call that a\r\nSystem in itself—to call that a glorious fabric of human wisdom—which is\r\nno more than the mere demolition of another System—is a perversion of\r\nterms which, however prevalent of late, can only be the effect of gross\r\nmisconception, or of great hypocrisy. We boast that we have done every\r\nthing, when we have merely destroyed all that before existed, without\r\nsubstituting any thing in its place. Such was the _Final Adjustment_ of\r\n1782; and I can prove it to be so, not only from the plainest reasoning,\r\nbut I can prove it by the opinion expressed by the British Parliament at\r\nthat very time. I can prove it by the opinion expressed by those very\r\nMinisters by whom it was proposed and conducted. I refer, for what I\r\nhave said, to proofs which they will find it very difficult to answer;\r\nI mean their own acts, which will plainly shew that they were of opinion\r\nthat a new System would be necessary. But, Sir, I will go farther—I\r\nwill also produce the authority of one of those whose influence, on the\r\npresent occasion, has been peculiarly exerted to prevent the discussion\r\nof the question in Ireland—of one, of whom I do not wish to speak but\r\nwith respect, but for whom, nevertheless, I should convey an idea of\r\nmore respect, than I can now feel to be due to him, if I were merely to\r\ndescribe him as the person who fills the same situation, in the House\r\nof Commons of Ireland, which you, Sir, hold among us, and of which on\r\nall occasions _you_ discharge the duties with a dignity and impartiality\r\nwhich reflects so much credit on yourself, and so well supports the\r\ncharacter and authority of the House.\r\n\r\nOn a former night, I read an Extract from the Journals, to shew what\r\nwas the opinion even of those by whom the Final Adjustment was proposed\r\non that Measure. It would there appear, that the Message was sent to\r\nthe Parliament of Ireland, recommending to them the adoption of some\r\nPlan for a Final Adjustment between the two Countries, and wishing to\r\nknow what were the grounds of the grievances of which they complained.\r\nIn answer to this Message, the Parliament of Ireland stated certain\r\ngrievances, the principal of which was, the power claimed by the\r\nParliament of Great Britain of making Laws to bind Ireland; but, with\r\nrespect to that part of the Message which related to the propriety of\r\nadopting some Measures for a Final Adjustment between the two Countries,\r\nthey were wholly silent. This Address was laid before the Parliament of\r\nGreat Britain, to whom a similar Message had been previously sent, and on\r\nthat ground was moved the Repeal of what was called the Declaratory Act,\r\nwhich Motion was assented to by the British Parliament. This satisfaction\r\nwas compleat to Ireland, as far as related to the grievance of which\r\nher Parliament had complained, viz. the Power of the British Parliament\r\nof making Laws for Ireland, because, by the Repeal of the Declaratory\r\nAct, that power was given up. But so far was the Minister of that day\r\nfrom considering that the Repeal of that Law finally terminated all\r\ndifferences, and established the Connection between the two Countries\r\nupon a solid basis, that he thought it necessary to move that a farther\r\nSettlement was indispensable for the maintenance of that Connection.\r\n\r\n    [Mr. SHERIDAN across the Table, desired that that part of the\r\n    Journals to which Mr. PITT alluded, might be read.]\r\n\r\nMr. PITT continued. Sir, I have stated the substance of the Journals\r\ncorrectly; they were read on a former night, and the Honourable Gentleman\r\nmay, if he chooses, have them read again.[1] If he does he will find that\r\nthey fully justify the statement I have made, but I beg that at present\r\nI may not be interrupted. I do maintain, that upon a reference to the\r\nJournals of the period to which I have alluded, it will appear that a\r\nfarther agreement between Great Britain and Ireland is there dated, in\r\nthe opinion of the Administration of the day, to be absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\n    [1] Vide Appendix.\r\n\r\nI beg farther to state, that after the motion for the Bill of which so\r\nmuch has been said, was passed, an Address to HIS MAJESTY was moved and\r\ncarried, praying him to take such further measures as to him seemed\r\nproper, to strengthen the Connection between the two Countries. HIS\r\nMAJESTY’S most Gracious Answer, stating, that in compliance with the\r\nAddress, he would immediately take such measures as might be necessary\r\nfor that purpose, was delivered to the House by an Honourable Gentleman\r\nwho then filled the office of Secretary of State, and whom we have not\r\nlately seen in the House, though he still continues to be a Member of it.\r\nI do assert, without the least fear of contradiction from any Gentleman\r\nwhatever, that it was in the contemplation of the Government of that\r\nday, to adopt some measures of the nature alluded to in the Address;\r\nsince that period, however, no such measure has been taken. I do also\r\nmaintain, that that very system which by these very Ministers who brought\r\nit forward was found to be imperfect, even for the purpose of maintaining\r\nthe Connection between the two Countries, remains at this moment in the\r\nsame imperfect state. It leaves the two Countries with separate and\r\nindependent Legislatures, connected only with this tie, that the Third\r\nEstate in both Countries is the same—that the Executive Government is the\r\nsame—that the Crown exercises its power of assenting to Irish Acts of\r\nParliament under the Great Seal of Great Britain, and by the advice of\r\nBritish Ministers.\r\n\r\nThis is the only principle of Connection which is left by the Final\r\nAdjustment of 1782. Whether this is a sufficient tie to unite them in\r\ntime of Peace; whether in time of War it is sufficient to consolidate\r\ntheir strength against a Common Enemy; whether it is sufficient to guard\r\nagainst those local jealousies which must necessarily sometimes exist\r\nbetween countries so connected; whether it is calculated to give to\r\nIreland all the important commercial and political advantages which she\r\nwould derive from a closer Connection with Great Britain; whether it can\r\ngive to both Nations that degree of strength and prosperity which must be\r\nthe result of such a Measure as the present, I believe needs only to be\r\nstated to be decided.\r\n\r\nBut I have already said, that I have upon this point, the authority\r\nof an opinion to which I before alluded—an opinion delivered upon a\r\nvery important Measure, very soon after the Final Adjustment of 1782.\r\nThe Measure to which I refer, was that of the Commercial Propositions\r\nwhich were brought forward in 1785. I am not now going to enter into\r\na discussion of the merits of that Measure. The best, perhaps, that\r\ncan be said of it is, that it went as far as circumstances would then\r\npermit, to draw the two Countries to a closer Connection. But those who\r\nthink that the Adjustment of 1782 was final, and that it contained all\r\nthat was necessary for the establishment of the Connection between the\r\ntwo Countries upon a firm basis, can hardly contend that the Commercial\r\nPropositions of 1785 were necessary to prevent the danger of separation\r\nbetween the two Countries, and to prevent the conflicting operation of\r\nIndependent Legislatures. Yet, if I am not mistaken, there will be found,\r\nupon a reference to better Records than those in which Parliamentary\r\nDebates are usually stated (I mean a statement of what passed in the\r\ndiscussion upon those Propositions fourteen years ago, made, as I have\r\nunderstood, by some of the principal parties themselves) that the\r\nCHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER of that day in Ireland, in a Debate upon\r\nthe Irish Propositions, held this language—“If this infatuated Country\r\ngives up the present offer, she may look for it again in vain.” Here the\r\nRight Honourable Gentleman was happily mistaken; Ireland has again had\r\nthe offer of the same advantages, but more compleat, and in all respects\r\nbetter calculated to attain their object; and this offer the Right\r\nHonourable Gentleman has exerted all his influence to reject. But he\r\ngoes on to say—“THINGS CANNOT REMAIN AS THEY ARE—Commercial jealousy is\r\nroused—it will increase with _two independent Legislatures_—and without\r\nan united interest in commerce, in a commercial Empire, political Union\r\nwill receive many shocks, and _separation of interest_ must threaten\r\n_separation of Connection_, which every _honest Irishman_ must shudder to\r\nlook at, as a possible event.”\r\n\r\nGentlemen will have the goodness to observe, that I am not now quoting\r\nthese expressions as pledges given by that Right Honourable Gentleman\r\nthat he would support a proposal for a Union between the two Countries,\r\nbut I am adducing them to prove that the situation of the two Countries\r\nafter the Final Adjustment of 1782, was such, in his opinion, as led\r\nto the danger of a separation between them. I am not now arguing that\r\na Legislative Union is the only measure which can possibly be adopted,\r\nbut I am contending that the Adjustment of 1782 was never considered as\r\nfinal, by those who now state it to be so as an argument against the\r\nconsideration of the present measure. How the Honourable Gentleman on\r\nthe other side of the House will evade this authority I do not know;—an\r\nauthority too, which, I must observe, he seems much more inclined to\r\ntreat with respect than he was formerly.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, it does not stop there. What is the evil to which he alludes?\r\nCommercial jealousies between two Countries acting upon the laws of two\r\nindependent Legislatures, and the danger of those Legislatures acting\r\nin opposition to each other.—How can this evil be remedied? By two\r\nmeans only; either by some Compact entered into by the Legislatures\r\nof the two Countries respecting the mode of forming their commercial\r\nregulations, or else by blending the two Legislatures together; these\r\nare the only two means. I defy the wit of man to point out a third. The\r\nmode of compact was proposed in 1785, but unfortunately, in spite of\r\nthat Right Honourable Gentleman’s eloquence and authority, who then\r\nstated the importance of guarding against the evil, it so happened that\r\ndoctrines, derived chiefly from this side of the water, succeeded in\r\nconvincing the Parliament of Ireland, that it would be inconsistent\r\nwith their independence, to enter into any compact whatever. We have\r\nthen the authority of that Right Honourable Gentleman to whom I have so\r\noften alluded, that the unsettled state in which the matter was left,\r\nwould give “Political Union many shocks, and lead to a separation of\r\nConnection.” The experiment of a mutual Compact has been tried without\r\nsuccess; the arrangement of that sort, which was proposed in 1785, in\r\norder to obviate the inconveniences stated by the Right Honourable\r\nGentleman, was then attacked with the same success against his authority,\r\nas another and more effectual remedy has recently experienced under his\r\nauspices. The result then is—you must remain in the state which that\r\nRight Honourable Gentleman has described, with the seeds of separation in\r\nthe system now established, and with the Connection, on which the mutual\r\nprosperity of both countries depends in danger of being hourly dissolved,\r\nor you must again recur to the proposal of a compact similar to that\r\nrejected in 1785, or you must resort to the best and most effectual\r\nremedy,—A LEGISLATIVE UNION.\r\n\r\nI have dwelt longer, perhaps, upon this part of the subject than was\r\nabsolutely necessary, because I believe there is scarcely any man who\r\nhas ever asked himself, whether there is a solid, permanent system of\r\nConnection between the two Countries, who could, upon reflection, answer\r\nthe question in the affirmative. But besides the authorities of the\r\npersons who made the arrangement in 1782, and of those who have since\r\ntreated of it, to shew that it was not deemed to be final and complete;\r\nI have further the test of experience to shew how imperfect it was,\r\nand how inadequate in practice to the great object of cementing the\r\nConnection, and placing it beyond the danger of being dissolved. In the\r\nsingle instance, which has occurred, (and that a melancholy one which\r\nall of us deplored,) in which we could feel the effects of two jarring\r\nLegislatures, We did feel it. On that occasion, it might have produced\r\nthe most signal calamities, had we not been rescued from its danger by\r\nan event, to which no man can now look back without feeling the utmost\r\njoy and exultation; feelings, which subsequent circumstances have served\r\nto heighten and confirm. Every Gentleman will know, that I must allude\r\nto the Regency. With two independent Legislatures, acting upon different\r\nprinciples, it was accident alone that preserved the identity of the\r\nExecutive Power, which is the bond and security of the Connection: And\r\neven then the Executive authority, though vested in one person, would\r\nhave been held by two different tenures, by one tenure in England, by\r\nanother in Ireland, had not the interposition of Providence prevented a\r\ncircumstance pregnant with the most imminent perils, and which might have\r\noperated to a separation of the two kingdoms.\r\n\r\nAfter seeing the recorded opinion of Parliament, of those who made the\r\narrangement of 1782, and after the decided testimony of experience on\r\nthe subject, within the short period of sixteen years, perhaps, it is\r\nhardly necessary to appeal to farther proofs of its inadequacy, or to\r\ndesire Gentlemen to look forward to possible cases, which I could easily\r\nput, and which will naturally suggest themselves to the minds of all, who\r\nchuse to turn their attention to the subject.\r\n\r\nBut when we consider the distinct powers possessed by the two\r\nLegislatures on all the great questions of Peace and War, of alliances\r\nand confederacies,—(for they each have in principle, a right to discuss\r\nthem and decide upon them, though one of them has hitherto been wisely\r\nrestrained by discretion, from the exercise of that right),—have we\r\nnot seen circumstances to induce us to think it possible, at least,\r\nthat on some of these important questions the opinions and decisions of\r\nthe two Parliaments might have been at variance? Are we talking of an\r\nindissoluble Connection, when we see it thus perpetually liable to be\r\nendangered? Can we really think that the interests of the Empire, or of\r\nits different branches rest upon a safe and solid basis at present? I\r\nam anxious to discuss this point closely with any man, either here, or\r\nin Ireland. Will it be said, that the Parliament of the latter Country\r\nis bound by our decision on the question of Peace or War? And if not so\r\nbound, will any man, looking at human Nature as it is, contend, that\r\nthere is a sufficient certainty that the decision on that important\r\nsubject will always be the same in both countries? I should be glad to\r\nreceive a distinct answer to this question, from the Honourable Gentleman\r\nwho has declared himself to be as warm a friend to the Connection between\r\nthe two Countries as I am.\r\n\r\nSuppose, for instance, that the present war, which the Parliament of\r\nGreat Britain considers to be just and necessary, had been voted by the\r\nIrish Parliament, to be unjust, unnecessary, extravagant, and hostile to\r\nthe principles of humanity and freedom.—Would that Parliament have been\r\nbound by this Country? If not;—what security have we, at a moment the\r\nmost important to our common interest and common salvation, that the two\r\nKingdoms should have but one friend and one foe? I repeat it; I am eager\r\nto hear what can be said in justification of a basis so imperfect and\r\nunsound, and liable to be shaken by so many accidents. I have already\r\nobserved, that in the peculiar circumstances of the present moment,\r\nwe may find stronger reasons to prove the necessity of correcting the\r\nsystem of Connection between this Country and Ireland, of supplying its\r\nimperfections, and strengthening its weakness, than are to be found at\r\nany former period.\r\n\r\nHaving thus stated, Sir, and I think sufficiently proved, that the\r\nSettlement of 1782, in every point of view in which it can be considered,\r\nis imperfect, and inadequate to the object of maintaining the connection\r\nbetween the two kingdoms, I proceed next to the circumstances which\r\npeculiarly call upon us at the present moment to remedy that imperfection.\r\n\r\nThis Country is at this time engaged in the most important, and momentous\r\nconflict, that ever occurred in the History of the World; a conflict in\r\nwhich Great Britain is distinguished for having made the only manly and\r\nsuccessful stand against the common enemies of civilized society. We see\r\nthe point in which that Enemy think us the most assailable—Are we not\r\nthen bound in policy and prudence, to strengthen that vulnerable point,\r\ninvolved as we are in a contest of Liberty against Despotism—of Property\r\nagainst Plunder and Rapine—of Religion and Order against Impiety and\r\nAnarchy? There was a time when this would have been termed declamation;\r\nbut, unfortunately, long and bitter experience has taught us to feel that\r\nit is only the feeble and imperfect representation of those calamities\r\n(the result of French Principles and French Arms), which are every day\r\nattested by the wounds of a bleeding world.\r\n\r\nIs there a man who does not admit the importance of a measure which, at\r\nsuch a crisis, may augment the strength of the Empire, and thereby ensure\r\nits safety? Would not that benefit to Ireland be of itself so solid, so\r\ninestimable, that, in comparison with it, all Commercial Interests, and\r\nthe preservation of local habits and manners, would be trifling, even\r\nif they were endangered by the present measure;—which they undoubtedly\r\nare not? The people of Ireland are proud, I believe, of being associated\r\nwith us in the great contest in which we are engaged, and must feel the\r\nadvantage of augmenting the general force of the Empire. That the present\r\nmeasure is calculated to produce that effect, is a proposition which I\r\nthink cannot be disputed. There is not in any Court of Europe a Statesman\r\nso ill informed as not to know, that the general power of the Empire\r\nwould be increased to a very great extent indeed, by such a consolidation\r\nof the strength of the two Kingdoms. In the course of the Century every\r\nwriter of any information on the subject has held the same language, and\r\nin the general strength of the Empire both Kingdoms are more concerned\r\nthan in any particular interests which may belong to either. If we were\r\nto ask the Ministers of our Allies, what measure they thought the most\r\nlikely to augment the power of the British Empire, and consequently\r\nincrease that strength by which they were now protected—if we were to ask\r\nthe Agent of our Enemies, what measure would be the most likely to render\r\ntheir designs abortive—the answer would be the same in both cases, viz.\r\nthe firm consolidation of every part of the Empire.\r\n\r\nThere is another consideration well worth attention. Recollect what are\r\nthe peculiar means by which we have been enabled to resist the unequalled\r\nand eccentric efforts of France, without any diminution, nay, with an\r\nincrease, of our general prosperity—what, but the great Commercial\r\nResources which we possess? A Measure, then, which must communicate\r\nto such a mighty Limb of the Empire as Ireland, all the Commercial\r\nadvantages which Great Britain possesses, which will open the markets of\r\nthe one Country to the other, which will give them both the common use of\r\ntheir Capital, must, by diffusing a large portion of wealth into Ireland,\r\nconsiderably increase the Resources, and consequently the strength, of\r\nthe whole Empire.\r\n\r\nBut it is not merely in this general view, that I think the Question\r\nought to be considered.—We ought to look to it with a view peculiarly to\r\nthe permanent interest and security of Ireland. When that Country was\r\nthreatened with the double danger of hostile attacks by Enemies without,\r\nand of Treason within, from what quarter did she derive the means of her\r\ndeliverance?—from the Naval Force of Great Britain—from the voluntary\r\nexertions of her Military of every description, not called for by Law—and\r\nfrom her pecuniary resources, added to the loyalty and energy of the\r\nInhabitants of Ireland itself;—of which it is impossible to speak with\r\ntoo much praise, and which shews how well they deserve to be called the\r\nBrethren of Britons. Their own courage might, perhaps, have ultimately\r\nsucceeded, in repelling the dangers by which they were threatened, but\r\nit would have been after a long contest, and after having waded through\r\nseas of blood. Are we sure that the same ready and effectual assistance\r\nwhich we have happily afforded, on the present occasion, will be always\r\nequally within our power? Great Britain has always felt a common interest\r\nin the safety of Ireland; but that common interest was never so obvious\r\nand urgent as when the Common Enemy made her attack upon Great Britain,\r\nthrough the medium of Ireland, and when their attack upon Ireland went\r\nto deprive her of her Connection with Great Britain, and to substitute\r\nin stead, the new Government of the French Republic. When that danger\r\nthreatened Ireland, the purse of Great Britain was open for the wants of\r\nIreland, as for the necessities of England.\r\n\r\nI do not, Sir, state these circumstances, as upbraiding Ireland for the\r\nbenefits we have conferred; far from it; but I state them with pleasure,\r\nas shewing the friendship and good will with which this Country has acted\r\ntowards her. But if struggles of this sort may and must return again,\r\nif the worst dangers are those which are yet to come, dangers which may\r\nbe greater from being more disguised—if those situations may arise when\r\nthe same means of relief are not in our power, what is the remedy that\r\nreason and policy point out? It is to identify them with us—it is to make\r\nthem part of the same Community, by giving them a full share of those\r\naccumulated blessings which are diffused throughout Great Britain; it\r\nis, in a word, by giving them a full participation of the Wealth, the\r\nPower, and the Stability, of the British Empire. If then this Measure\r\ncomes recommended not only by the obvious defects of the system which now\r\nexists, but that it has also the pre-eminent recommendation of increasing\r\nthe general power of the Empire, and of guarding against future danger\r\nfrom the Common Enemy, we are next to consider it as to its effects upon\r\nthe internal condition of Ireland.\r\n\r\nI know perfectly well, that as long as Ireland is separated from Great\r\nBritain, any attempt on our part to provide measures which we might think\r\nsalutary, as respecting questions of contending sects or parties, of the\r\nclaimed rights of the Catholics, or of the precautions necessary for the\r\nsecurity of the Protestants—I know that all these, though they may have\r\nbeen brought forward by the very persons who are the advocates of the\r\nFinal Adjustment in 1782, were, in fact, attacks upon the Independence\r\nof the Irish Parliament, and attempts to usurp the Right of deciding\r\non points which can only be brought within our province by Compact.\r\nUntil the Kingdoms are united, any attempt to make regulations here\r\nfor the internal state of Ireland must certainly be a violation of her\r\nIndependence. But feeling as I do, for their interests and their welfare,\r\nI cannot be inattentive to the events that are passing before me; I\r\nmust therefore repeat, that whoever looks at the circumstances to which\r\nI have alluded—whoever considers that the Enemy have shewn by their\r\nconduct, that they considered Ireland as the weakest and most vulnerable\r\npart of the Empire; whoever reflects upon those dreadful and inexcusable\r\ncruelties instigated by the Enemies of both Countries, and upon those\r\nlamentable severities by which the exertions for the defense of Ireland\r\nwere unhappily, but unavoidably, attended, and the necessity of which\r\nis itself one great aggravation of the Crimes and Treasons which led to\r\nthem, must feel that, as it now stands composed, in the hostile division\r\nof its Sects, in the animosities existing between ancient Settlers and\r\noriginal Inhabitants, in the ignorance and want of Civilization, which\r\nmarks that Country more than almost any other Country in Europe, in the\r\nunfortunate prevalence of Jacobin Principles, arising from these causes,\r\nand augmenting their malignity, and which have produced that distressed\r\nstate which we now deplore; every one, I say, who reflects upon all\r\nthese circumstances, must agree with me in thinking, that there is no\r\ncure but in the formation of a General Imperial Legislature, free alike\r\nfrom terror and from resentment, removed from the danger and agitation,\r\nuninfluenced by the prejudices and uninflamed by the passions of that\r\ndistracted Country.\r\n\r\nI know that it is impossible, if we wish to consider this subject\r\nproperly, to consider it in any other point of view than as it affects\r\nthe Empire in general. I know that the interests of the two Countries\r\nmust be taken together, and that a man cannot speak as a true Englishman,\r\nunless he speaks as a true Irishman, nor as a true Irishman, unless he\r\nspeaks as a true Englishman: But if it was possible to separate them,\r\nand I could consider myself as addressing you, not as interested for the\r\nEmpire at large, but for Ireland alone, I should say, that it would be\r\nindispensably necessary, for the sake of that Country, to compose its\r\npresent distractions, by the adoption of another system:—I should say,\r\nthat the establishment of an Imperial Legislature was the only means of\r\nhealing its wounds and of restoring it to tranquillity. I must here take\r\nthe liberty of alluding to some topics which were touched upon during the\r\ndiscussion of the former night.\r\n\r\nAmong the great and known defects of Ireland, one of the most prominent\r\nfeatures is, its want of industry and a capital; how are those wants to\r\nbe supplied, but by blending more closely with Ireland, the industry\r\nand the capital of this Country. But, above all, in the great leading\r\ndistinctions between the People of Ireland, I mean their religious\r\ndistinctions, what is their situation?—The Protestant feels that the\r\nclaims of the Catholics threatens the existence of the Protestant\r\nascendancy; while, on the other hand, the great body of Catholics feel\r\nthe establishment of the National Church, and their exclusion from the\r\nexercise of certain rights, and privileges, a grievance. Between the two,\r\nit becomes a matter of difficulty in the minds of many persons, whether\r\nit would be better to listen only to the fears of the former, or to grant\r\nthe claims of the latter.\r\n\r\nI am well aware that the subject of religious distinction is a dangerous\r\nand delicate topic, especially when applied to a country such as Ireland;\r\nthe situation of which is different in this respect from that of every\r\nother. Where the established religion of the State is the same as the\r\ngeneral religion of the Empire, and where the property of the Country\r\nis in the hands of a comparatively small number of persons professing\r\nthat established religion, while the religion of a great majority of\r\nthe people is different, it is not easy to say, on general principles,\r\nwhat system of Church Establishment in such a Country would be free from\r\ndifficulty and inconvenience. By many I know it will be contended, that\r\nthe religion professed by a majority of the people, would at least be\r\nentitled to an equality of Privileges. I have heard such an argument\r\nurged in this House; but those who apply it without qualification to the\r\ncase of Ireland, forget surely the principles on which English Interest\r\nand English Connection has been established in that Country, and on\r\nwhich its present Legislature is formed. No man can say, that, in the\r\npresent State of things, and while Ireland remains a separate kingdom,\r\nfull concessions could be made to the Catholics, without endangering the\r\nState, and shaking the Constitution of Ireland to its centre.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, without anticipating the discussion, or the propriety\r\nof agitating the question, or saying how soon or how late it may be fit\r\nto discuss it; two propositions are indisputable: First, When the conduct\r\nof the Catholics shall be such as to make it safe for the Government\r\nto admit them to the participation of the privileges granted to those\r\nof the Established Religion, and when the temper of the times shall be\r\nfavourable to such a measure;—When these events take place, it is obvious\r\nthat such a question may be agitated in an United, Imperial Parliament,\r\nwith much greater safety, than it could be in a separate Legislature. In\r\nthe second place, I think it certain that, even for whatever period it\r\nmay be thought necessary, after the Union, to withhold from the Catholics\r\nthe enjoyment of those advantages, many of the objections which at\r\npresent arise out of their situation would be removed, if the Protestant\r\nLegislature were no longer separate and local, but general and Imperial;\r\nand the Catholics themselves would at once feel a mitigation of the most\r\ngoading and irritating of their present causes of complaint.\r\n\r\nHow far, in addition to this great and leading consideration, it may\r\nalso be wise and practicable to accompany the measure by some mode of\r\nrelieving the lower orders from the pressure of Tithes, which in many\r\ninstances operate at present as a great practical evil, or to make,\r\nunder proper Regulations, and without breaking in on the security of the\r\npresent Protestant Establishment, an effectual and adequate provision for\r\nthe Catholic Clergy, it is not now necessary to discuss. It is sufficient\r\nto say, that these, and all other subordinate points connected with\r\nthe same subject, are more likely to be permanently and satisfactorily\r\nsettled by an United Legislature, than by any local arrangements. On\r\nthese grounds I contend, that with a view to providing an effectual\r\nremedy for the distractions which have unhappily prevailed in Ireland,\r\nwith a view of removing those causes which have endangered, and still\r\nendanger its security, the measure which I am now proposing promises\r\nto be more effectual than any other which can be devised, and on these\r\ngrounds alone, if there existed no other, I should feel it my duty to\r\nsubmit it to the House.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, though what I have thus stated relates most immediately to the\r\ngreat object of healing the dissentions, and providing for the internal\r\ntranquillity of Ireland; there are also other objects which, though\r\ncomparatively with this of inferior importance, are yet in themselves\r\nhighly material, and in a secondary view, well worthy of attention.\r\n\r\nI have heard it asked, when I pressed the measure, what are the positive\r\nadvantages that Ireland is to derive from it? To this very question I\r\npresume the considerations which I have already urged afford a sufficient\r\nanswer. But, in fact, the question itself is to be considered in another\r\nview; and it will be found to bear some resemblance to a question which\r\nhas been repeatedly put, by some of the Gentlemen opposite to me, during\r\nthe last six years. What are the advantages which Great Britain has\r\ngained by the present war with France?\r\n\r\nTo this, the brilliant successes of the British arms by sea and land, our\r\nunexampled naval victories over all our enemies, the solid acquisition of\r\nvaluable territory, the general increase of our power, the progressive\r\nextension of our commerce, and a series of events more glorious than any\r\nthat ever adorned the page of our history, afford at once an ample and a\r\nsatisfactory answer. But there is another general answer which we have\r\nuniformly given, and which would alone be sufficient; it is, that we did\r\nnot enter into this war for any purpose of ambition; our object was not\r\nto acquire, but to preserve; and in this sense, what we have gained by\r\nthe war is, in one word, all that we should have lost without it: it is,\r\nthe preservation of our Constitution, our Independence, our Honour, our\r\nExistence as a Nation.\r\n\r\nIn the same manner I might answer the question with respect to Ireland;\r\nI might enumerate the general advantages which Ireland would derive\r\nfrom the effects of the Arrangement to which I have already referred:\r\nThe Protection which she will secure to herself in the hour of danger.\r\nThe most effectual means of increasing her Commerce and improving her\r\nAgriculture, the command of English Capital, the infusion of English\r\nManners and English Industry, necessarily tending to ameliorate her\r\nCondition, to accelerate the progress of internal civilization, and to\r\nterminate those feuds and dissentions which now distract the Country, and\r\nwhich she does not possess, within herself, the power either to controul\r\nor to extinguish. She would see the avenue to Honours, to Distinctions,\r\nand exalted Situations in the general seat of Empire, opened to all those\r\nwhose abilities and talents enable them to indulge an honourable and\r\nlaudable ambition.\r\n\r\nBut, independent of all these advantages, I might also answer, that the\r\nquestion is not what Ireland is to gain, but what she is to preserve;\r\nnot merely how she may best improve her situation, but how she is to\r\navert a pressing and immediate danger. In this view, what she gains\r\nis the preservation of all those blessings arising from the British\r\nConstitution, and which are inseparable from her Connection with Great\r\nBritain. Those Blessings of which it has long been the aim of France, in\r\nconjunction with domestic traitors, to deprive her, and on their ruins\r\nto establish (with all its attendant miseries and horrors) a Jacobin\r\nRepublic, founded on French Influence, and existing only in subserviency\r\nto France.\r\n\r\nSuch, Sir, would be the answer, if we direct our attention only to the\r\nquestion of general advantage. And here I should be inclined to stop;\r\nbut since it has also been more particularly asked, what are the\r\nadvantages which she is to gain, in point of Commerce and Manufactures,\r\nI am desirous of applying my answer more immediately and distinctly to\r\nthat part of the subject: and, as I know that the statement will carry\r\nmore conviction with it, to those who make the inquiry, if given in the\r\nwords of the Right Honourable Gentleman, to whom, and to whose opinions,\r\nI have had more than one occasion to advert in the course of this night,\r\nI will read you an extract from his recorded sentiments on the subject,\r\nin the year 1785, on this same memorable occasion of the Commercial\r\nPropositions. Speaking of a solid and unalterable Compact between the\r\ntwo Countries, speaking expressly of the peculiar importance of insuring\r\nthe continuance of those Commercial benefits, which she at that time\r\nheld only at the discretion of this country, he says—“The exportation of\r\nIrish Products, to England, amounts to Two Millions and a Half annually;\r\nand the exportation of British Products, to Ireland, amounts to but One\r\nMillion.”\r\n\r\nHe then proceeds to reason upon the advantage which Ireland would derive,\r\nunder such circumstances, from guarding against mutual prohibitions;\r\nand he accompanies the statement, which I have just read, with this\r\nobservation—\r\n\r\n“If, indeed, the Adjustment were to take away the Benefit from Ireland,\r\nit would be a good cause for rejecting it; but, as it for ever confirms\r\nall the Advantages we derived from our Linen Trade, and binds England\r\nfrom making any law that can be injurious to it, surely Gentlemen\r\nwho regard that trade, and _whose fortunes and rents depend on its\r\nprosperity, will not entertain a moment’s doubt about embracing the\r\noffer_.”\r\n\r\nSuch was the reasoning of the Irish CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER; which\r\nI consider to have been perfectly just. With reference to his late\r\nopinions, I do not think I can more forcibly reply, to a person who signs\r\nhis name to Propositions which declare that the ruin of the Linen Trade\r\nof Ireland is likely to be the consequence of an Union, than by opposing\r\nto him his own opinion. I shall be able to strengthen the former opinion\r\nof that Gentleman, by stating, that the progress that has been made in\r\nCommercial advantages to Ireland, since 1785, has been such as to render\r\nhis argument still more applicable. What is the nature of that Commerce,\r\nexplained by the same person in so concise and forcible a manner, that\r\nI am happy to use his own statement? He does not confine himself to the\r\ngross amount, but gives the articles in detail:—\r\n\r\n“Britain,” he says, “imports annually from us Two Million Five Hundred\r\nThousand Pounds of our products, all, or very nearly all, duty free,\r\nand covenants never to lay a duty on them. We import about a Million of\r\nher’s, and raise a Revenue on almost every article of it, and reserve\r\nthe power of continuing that Revenue. She exports to us Salt for our\r\nFisheries and Provisions; Hops, which we cannot grow; Coals, which we\r\ncannot raise; Tin, which we have not; and Bark, which we cannot get\r\nelsewhere: and all these without reserving any duty.”\r\n\r\nI will not tire the patience of the House, by reading farther extracts;\r\nbut the Right Honourable Gentleman’s whole Speech, in like manner,\r\npoints out the advantages of the Commercial Propositions (at that time\r\nunder consideration) as a ground-work of a Compact between the two\r\nCountries, in 1785, on Commercial subjects.—But how stands the case now?\r\nThe trade is at this time infinitely more advantageous to Ireland. It\r\nwill be proved, from the documents which I hold in my hand, as far as\r\nrelates to the mere interchange of manufactures, that the manufactures,\r\nexported to Ireland from Great Britain, in 1797, very little exceeded a\r\nMillion sterling (the articles of produce amount to nearly the same sum)\r\nwhile Great Britain, on the other hand, imported from Ireland to the\r\namount of near Three Millions in the manufactured articles of Linen and\r\nLinen Yarn, and between Two and Three Millions in Provisions and Cattle,\r\nbesides Corn and other articles of produce.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these Articles, there are other circumstances of advantage\r\nto Ireland. Articles which are essential to her trade and to her\r\nsubsistence, or serve as raw materials for her manufactures, are sent\r\nfrom hence free of duty. It is expressly stated on the same authority,\r\nthat all that we take back from Ireland was liable to a Duty in that\r\nCountry on their exports: The increasing produce of the chief article\r\nof their manufacture, and four-fifths of her whole export trade, are\r\nto be ascribed, not to that _Independent Legislature_, but, to the\r\nliberality of the British Parliament. It is by the free admission of\r\nLinens for our market, and the Bounties granted by the British Parliament\r\non its re-export, that the Linen-Trade has been brought to the height\r\nat which we now see it. To the Parliament of this Country, then, it is\r\nnow owing, that a Market has been opened for her Linen to the amount of\r\nthree millions. By the Bounty we give to Ireland, we afford her a double\r\nmarket for that article, and (what is still more striking and important)\r\nwe have prevented a competition against her, arising from the superior\r\ncheapness of the Linen-Manufactures of the Continent, by subjecting their\r\nimportation to a Duty of thirty per cent. Nothing would more clearly\r\nshew what would be the danger to Ireland from the Competition in all\r\nits principal branches of the Linen-Trade, than the simple fact, that\r\nwe even now import foreign Linens, under this heavy duty, to an amount\r\nequal to a seventh part of all that Ireland is able to send us, with\r\nthe preference that has been stated. By this arrangement alone, we must\r\ntherefore be considered, either as foregoing between seven and eight\r\nhundred thousand pounds per annum in revenue, which we should collect if\r\nwe chose to levy the same duty on all Linens, Irish as well as Foreign,\r\nor on the other hand, as sacrificing perhaps at least a million sterling\r\nin the price paid for those articles, by the subjects of this Country,\r\nwhich might be saved, if we allowed the importation of all Linen, Foreign\r\nas well as Irish, equally free from Duty.\r\n\r\nThe present measure is, however, in its effects calculated not merely\r\nfor a confirmation of the advantages on which the person to whom I have\r\nalluded has insisted. It is obvious that a fuller and more perfect\r\nConnection of the two Countries, from whatever cause it may arise, must\r\nproduce a greater facility and freedom of commercial intercourse, and\r\nultimately tend to the advantage of both. The benefits to be derived to\r\neither Country from such an arrangement must indeed, in a great measure,\r\nbe gradual; but they are not on that account the less certain, and they\r\ncannot be stated in more forcible language than in that used in the\r\nSpeech to which I have referred.—\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen undervalue the reduction of British Duties on our\r\nManufactures. I agree with them it may not operate soon, but we are to\r\nlook forward to a final settlement, and it is impossible but that in\r\ntime, with as good climate, equal natural powers, cheaper food, and fewer\r\ntaxes, we must be able to sell to them. When commercial jealousy shall\r\nbe banished by final settlement, and Trade take its natural and steady\r\ncourse, the Kingdoms will cease to look to rivalship, each will make that\r\nfabrick which it can do cheapest, and buy from the other what it cannot\r\nmake so advantageously. Labour will be then truly employed to profit, not\r\ndiverted by Bounties, Jealousies, or Legislative Interference, from its\r\nnatural and beneficial course. This system will attain its real object,\r\nconsolidating the strength of the remaining parts of the Empire, by\r\nencouraging the communications of their market among themselves, with\r\npreference to every part against all strangers!”\r\n\r\nI am at least, therefore, secure from the design of appearing to\r\ndeliver any partial or chimerical opinion of my own, when I thus state,\r\non the authority of a person the best informed, and who then judged\r\ndispassionately, both the infinite importance to Ireland of securing\r\npermanently the great commercial advantages which she now holds at the\r\ndiscretion of Great Britain, and the additional benefit which she would\r\nderive from any settlement which opened to her gradually a still more\r\nfree and compleat commercial intercourse with this Country. And while\r\nI state thus strongly the commercial advantages to the sister Kingdom,\r\nI have no alarm left I should excite any sentiment of jealousy here. I\r\nknow that the inhabitants of Great Britain wish well to the prosperity\r\nof Ireland;—that, if the Kingdoms are really and solidly united, they\r\nfeel that to increase the commercial wealth of one Country is not to\r\ndiminish that of the other, but to increase the strength and power of\r\nboth. But to justify that sentiment, we must be satisfied that the wealth\r\nwe are pouring into the lap of Ireland is not every day liable to be\r\nsnatched from us, and thrown into the scale of the enemy. If therefore\r\nIreland is to continue, as I trust it will for ever, an essential part\r\nof the integral strength of the British Empire; if her strength is to be\r\npermanently ours, and our strength to be hers, neither I, nor any English\r\nminister, can ever be deterred by the fear of creating jealousy in the\r\nhearts of Englishmen, from stating the advantages of a closer Connection,\r\nor from giving any assistance to the Commercial Prosperity of that\r\nKingdom.\r\n\r\nIf ever indeed I should have the misfortune to witness the melancholy\r\nmoment when such principles must be abandoned, when all hope of seeing\r\nIreland permanently and securely connected with this country shall be at\r\nan end, I shall at least have the consolation of knowing, that it will\r\nnot be the want of temper or forbearance, of conciliation, of kindness,\r\nor of full explanation on our part, which will have produced an event\r\nso fatal to Ireland, and so dangerous to Great Britain. If ever the\r\nover-bearing power of prejudice and passion shall produce that fatal\r\nconsequence, it will too late be perceived and acknowledged, that all the\r\ngreat commercial advantages which Ireland at present enjoys, and which\r\nare continually increasing, are to be ascribed to the liberal conduct,\r\nthe fostering care, of the British Empire, extended to the Sister\r\nKingdom as to a part of ourselves, and not (as has been fallaciously and\r\nvainly pretended) to any thing which has been done or can be done by the\r\nindependent power of her own separate Legislature.\r\n\r\nI have thus, Sir, endeavoured to state to you the reasons, why I think\r\nthis Measure advisable; why I wish it to be proposed to the Parliament\r\nof Ireland, with temper and fairness; and why it appears to me, entitled\r\nat least to a calm and dispassionate discussion in that Kingdom. I am\r\naware, however, that objections have been urged against the Measure, some\r\nof which are undoubtedly plausible, and have been but too successful in\r\ntheir influence on the Irish Parliament. Of these objections I shall now\r\nproceed, as concisely as possible, to take some notice.\r\n\r\nThe first is, what I heard alluded to by the Honourable Gentleman\r\nopposite to me, when his Majesty’s Message was brought down; namely—That\r\nthe Parliament of Ireland is incompetent to entertain and discuss\r\nthe question, or rather, to act upon the Measure proposed, without\r\nhaving previously obtained the consent of the People of Ireland, their\r\nConstituents. But, Sir, I am led to suppose from what the Honourable\r\nGentleman afterwards stated, that he made this objection, rather by way\r\nof deprecating the discussion of the question, than as entertaining the\r\nsmallest doubt upon it himself.—If, however, the Honourable Gentleman,\r\nor any other Gentleman on the other side of the House, should seriously\r\nentertain a doubt on the subject, I shall be ready to discuss it with\r\nhim distinctly, either this night or at any future opportunity. For\r\nthe present I will assume, that no man can deny the competency of the\r\nParliament of Ireland (representing as it does, in the language of\r\nour Constitution, “_lawfully, fully, and freely, all the estates of\r\nthe people of the realm_”) to make Laws to bind that People, unless\r\nhe is disposed to distinguish that Parliament from the Parliament\r\nof Great Britain; and, while he maintains the Independence of the\r\nIrish Legislature, yet denies to it the lawful and essential powers\r\nof Parliament.—No man, who maintains the Parliament of Ireland to be\r\nco-equal with our own, can deny its competency on this question, unless\r\nhe means to go the length of denying, at the same moment, the whole of\r\nthe authority of the Parliament of Great Britain—to shake every principle\r\nof legislation—and to maintain, that all the Acts passed, and every thing\r\ndone by Parliament, or sanctioned by its authority, however sacred,\r\nhowever beneficial, is neither more nor less than an act of usurpation.\r\nHe must not only deny the validity of the Union between Scotland and\r\nEngland, but he must deny the authority of every one of the proceedings\r\nof the united Legislature since the Union; nay, Sir, he must go still\r\nfarther, and deny the authority under which we now sit and deliberate\r\nhere, as a House of Parliament. Of course, he must deny the validity\r\nof the adjustment of 1782, and call in question every measure which\r\nhe has himself been the most forward to have enforced. This point,\r\nSir, is of so much importance, that I think I ought not to suffer the\r\nopportunity to pass, without illustrating more fully what I mean. If\r\nthis principle of the incompetency of Parliament to the decision of\r\nthe Measure be admitted, or if it be contended, that Parliament has no\r\nlegitimate authority to discuss and decide upon it, you will be driven\r\nto the necessity of recognizing a principle, the most dangerous that\r\never was adopted in any civilized State. I mean the principle, that\r\nParliament cannot adopt any measure new in its nature, and of great\r\nimportance, without appealing to the constituent and delegating authority\r\nfor directions. If that doctrine be true, look to what an extent it will\r\ncarry you. If such an argument could be set up and maintained, you acted\r\nwithout any legitimate authority when you created the representation\r\nof the Principality of Wales, or of either of the Counties Palatine of\r\nEngland. Every Law that Parliament ever made, without that appeal, either\r\nas to its own Frame and Constitution, as to the qualification of the\r\nelectors or the elected, as to the great and fundamental point of the\r\nsuccession to the Crown, was a breach of Treaty, and an Act of Usurpation.\r\n\r\nIf we turn to Ireland itself, what do Gentlemen think of the power of\r\nthat Parliament, which, without any fresh delegation from its Protestant\r\nconstituents, associates to itself all the Catholic electors, and thus\r\ndestroys a fundamental distinction on which it was formed? God forbid,\r\nthat I should object to or blame any of these Measures! I am only stating\r\nthe extent to which the principle (that Parliament has no authority to\r\ndecide upon the present Measure) will lead; and, if it be admitted in\r\none case, it must be admitted in all. Will any man say, that (although\r\na Protestant Parliament in Ireland, chosen exclusively by Protestant\r\nConstituents, has by its own inherent power, and without consulting those\r\nconstituents, admitted and comprehended the Catholics who were till\r\nthen, in fact, a separate community) that Parliament cannot associate\r\nitself with another Protestant community, represented by a Protestant\r\nParliament, having one interest with itself, and similar in its Laws, its\r\nConstitution, and its Established Religion? What must be said by those\r\nwho have at any time been friends to any plan of Parliamentary Reform,\r\nand particularly to such as have been most recently brought forward,\r\neither in Great Britain or Ireland? Whatever may have been thought of\r\nthe propriety of the Measure, I never heard any doubt of the competency\r\nof Parliament to consider and discuss it. Yet I defy any man to maintain\r\nthe principle of those plans, without contending that, as a Member of\r\nParliament, he possesses a right to concur in disfranchising those who\r\nsent him to Parliament, and to select others, by whom he was not elected,\r\nin their stead. I am sure that no sufficient distinction, in point of\r\nprinciple, can be successfully maintained for a single moment; nor should\r\nI deem it necessary to dwell on this point, in the manner I do, were\r\nI not convinced that it is connected in part with all those false and\r\ndangerous notions on the subject of Government which have lately become\r\ntoo prevalent in the world. It may, in fact, be traced to that gross\r\nperversion of the principles of all political society, which rests on\r\nthe supposition that there exists continually in every Government a\r\nSovereignty _in abeyance_ (as it were) on the part of the People, ready\r\nto be called forth on every occasion, or rather, on every pretence, when\r\nit may suit the purposes of the party or faction who are the advocates\r\nof this doctrine to suppose an occasion for its exertion. It is in\r\nthese false principles that are contained the seeds of all the misery,\r\ndesolation, and ruin, which in the present day have spread themselves\r\nover so large a portion of the habitable Globe.\r\n\r\nThese principles, Sir, are, at length, so well known and understood in\r\ntheir practical effects, that they can no longer hope for one enlightened\r\nor intelligent advocate, when they appear in their true colours. Yet,\r\nwith all the horror we all feel, in common with the rest of the World,\r\nat the effect of them, with all the confirmed and increasing love and\r\nveneration which we feel towards the Constitution of our Country, founded\r\nas it is, both in Theory and Experience, on principles directly the\r\nreverse; yet, there are too many among us, who, while they abhor and\r\nreject such opinions, when presented to them in their naked deformity,\r\nsuffer them in a more disguised shape to be gradually infused into\r\ntheir minds, and insensibly to influence and bias their sentiments and\r\narguments on the greatest and most important discussions. This concealed\r\npoison is now more to be dreaded than any open attempt to support such\r\nprinciples by argument or to enforce them by arms. No society, whatever\r\nbe its particular form, can long subsist, if this principle is once\r\nadmitted. In every Government, there must reside somewhere a supreme,\r\nabsolute, and unlimited authority. This is equally true of every lawful\r\nMonarchy—of every Aristocracy—of every pure Democracy (if indeed such\r\na form of Government ever has existed, or ever can exist)—and of those\r\nmixed Constitutions formed and compounded from the others, which we are\r\njustly inclined to prefer to any of them. In all these Governments,\r\nindeed alike, that power may by possibility be abused, but whether\r\nthe abuse is such as to justify and call for the interference of the\r\npeople collectively, or, more properly speaking, of any portion of it,\r\nmust always be an extreme case and a question of the greatest and most\r\nperilous responsibility, not in Law only, but in Conscience and in Duty,\r\nto all those who either act upon it themselves, or persuade others to\r\ndo so. But no provision for such a case ever has been or can be made\r\nbefore-hand; it forms no chapter in any known code of laws, it can find\r\nno place in any system of human jurisprudence. But, above all, if such a\r\nprinciple can make no part of any established Constitution, not even of\r\nthose where the Government is so framed as to be most liable to the abuse\r\nof its powers, it will be preposterous indeed to suppose that it can be\r\nadmitted in one where those powers are so distributed and balanced as to\r\nfurnish the best security against the probability of such an abuse. Shall\r\nthat principle be sanctioned as a necessary part of the best Government,\r\nwhich cannot be admitted to exist as an established check even upon the\r\nworst! Pregnant as it is with danger and confusion, shall it be received\r\nand authorized in proportion as every reason which can ever make it\r\nnecessary to recur to it is not likely to exist? Yet, Sir, I know not how\r\nit is, that, in proportion as we are less likely to have occasion for\r\nso desperate a remedy, in proportion as a Government is so framed as to\r\nprovide within itself the best guard and control on the exercise of every\r\nbranch of authority, to furnish the means of preventing or correcting\r\nevery abuse of power, and to secure, by its own natural operation, a due\r\nattention to the interest and feelings of every part of the community, in\r\nthat very proportion persons have been found perverse enough to imagine,\r\nthat such a Constitution admits and recognizes, as a part of it, that\r\nwhich is inconsistent with the nature of any Government, and, above all,\r\ninapplicable to our own.\r\n\r\nI have said more, Sir, upon this subject than I should have thought\r\nnecessary, if I had not felt that this false and dangerous mockery of\r\nthe _Sovereignty of the People_ is in truth one of the chief elements of\r\nJacobinism, one of the favourite impostures to mislead the understanding,\r\nand to flatter and inflame the passions of the mass of mankind, who have\r\nnot the opportunity of examining and exposing it, and that as such on\r\nevery occasion, and in every shape in which it appears, it ought to be\r\ncombated and resisted by every friend to civil order, and to the peace\r\nand happiness of mankind.\r\n\r\nSir, the next and not the least prevalent objection, is one which is\r\ncontained in words which are an appeal to a natural and laudable, but\r\nwhat I must call an erroneous and mistaken, sense of national pride.\r\nIt is an appeal to the generous and noble passions of a nation easily\r\ninflamed under any supposed attack upon its honour. I mean the attempt to\r\nrepresent the question of a Union by compact between the Parliaments of\r\nthe two Kingdoms as a question involving the Independance of Ireland.—It\r\nhas been said, that no compensation could be made to any country for\r\nthe surrender of its National Independance. Sir, on this, as well as on\r\nevery part of the question, I am desirous Gentlemen should come closely\r\nto the point, that they should sift it to the bottom, and ascertain\r\nupon what grounds and principles their opinion really rests. Do they\r\nmean to maintain that in any humiliating, in any degrading sense of the\r\nword which can be acted upon practically as a rule, and which can lead\r\nto any useful conclusion, that at any time when the Government of any\r\ntwo separate Countries unite in forming one more extensive empire, that\r\nthe individuals who composed either of the former narrow societies are\r\nafterwards less members of an independant country, or to any valuable and\r\nuseful purpose less possessed of political freedom or civil happiness\r\nthan they were before? It must be obvious to every Gentleman who will\r\nlook at the subject, in tracing the history of all the countries, the\r\nmost proud of their present existing independance, of all the nations\r\nin Europe, there is not one that could exist in the state in which it\r\nnow stands, if that principle had been acted upon by our forefathers;\r\nand Europe must have remained to this hour in a state of ignorance and\r\nbarbarism, from the perpetual warfare of independent and petty states.\r\nIn the instance of our own Country, it would be a superfluous waste\r\nof time to enumerate the steps by which all its parts were formed\r\ninto one Kingdom; but will any man in general assert, that in all the\r\ndifferent Unions which have formed the principal states of Europe, their\r\ninhabitants have become less free, that they have had less of which to be\r\nproud, less scope for their own exertions, than they had in their former\r\nsituation. If this doctrine is to be generally maintained, what becomes\r\nof the situation at this hour of any one county of England, or of any one\r\ncounty of Ireland, now united under the independant Parliament of that\r\nKingdom? If it be pushed to its full extent, it is obviously incompatible\r\nwith all civil society. As the former principle of the sovereignty of\r\nthe people strikes at the foundation of all governments, so this is\r\nequally hostile to all political confederacy, and mankind must be driven\r\nback to what is called the state of nature.\r\n\r\nBut while I combat this general and abstract principle, which would\r\noperate as an objection to every union between separate states, on the\r\nground of the sacrifice of independance, do I mean to contend that\r\nthere is in no case just ground for such a sentiment? Far from it: it\r\nmay become, on many occasions, the first duty of a free and generous\r\npeople. If there exists a country which contains within itself the means\r\nof military protection, the naval force necessary for its defence,\r\nwhich furnishes objects of industry sufficient for the subsistence\r\nof its inhabitants, and pecuniary resources adequate to maintaining,\r\nwith dignity, the rank which it has attained among the nations of the\r\nworld; if, above all, it enjoys the blessings of internal content and\r\ntranquillity, and possesses a distinct constitution of its own, the\r\ndefects of which, if any, it is within itself capable of correcting, and\r\nif that constitution be equal, if not superior, to that of any other in\r\nthe world, or (which is nearly the same thing) if those who live under\r\nit believe it to be so, and fondly cherish that opinion, I can indeed\r\nwell understand that such a country must be jealous of any measure,\r\nwhich, even by its own consent, under the authority of its own lawful\r\ngovernment, is to associate it as a part of a larger and more extensive\r\nempire.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, if, on the other hand, it should happen that there be a country\r\nwhich, against the greatest of all dangers that threaten its peace and\r\nsecurity, has not adequate means of protecting itself without the aid\r\nof another nation; if that other be a neighbouring and kindred nation,\r\nspeaking the same language, whose laws, whose customs, and habits are\r\nthe same in principle, but carried to a greater degree of perfection,\r\nwith a more extensive commerce, and more abundant means of acquiring\r\nand diffusing national wealth; the stability of whose government—the\r\nexcellence of whose constitution—is more than ever the admiration and\r\nenvy of Europe, and of which the very Country of which we are speaking\r\ncan only boast an inadequate and imperfect resemblance;—under such\r\ncircumstances, I would ask, what conduct would be prescribed by every\r\nrational principle of dignity, of honour, or of interest? I would\r\nask, whether this is not a faithful description of the circumstances\r\nwhich ought to dispose Ireland to a Union? Whether Great Britain is\r\nnot precisely the nation with which, on these principles, a Country,\r\nsituated as Ireland is, would desire to unite? Does a Union, under such\r\ncircumstances, by free consent, and on just and equal terms, deserve to\r\nbe branded as a proposal for subjecting Ireland to a foreign yoke? Is it\r\nnot rather the free and voluntary association of two great Countries,\r\nwhich join, for their common benefit, in one Empire, where each will\r\nretain its proportional weight and importance, under the security of\r\nequal laws, reciprocal affection, and inseparable interests, and which\r\nwant nothing but that indissoluble Connection to render both invincible.\r\n\r\n    Non ego nec Teucris Italos parere jubebo\r\n    Nec nova regna peto; paribus se legibus ambæ\r\n    Invictæ gentes æterna in fædera mittant.\r\n\r\nSir, I have nearly stated all that is necessary for me to trouble the\r\nHouse with; there are, however, one or two other objections which I wish\r\nnot entirely to pass over: One of them is, a general notion that a Union\r\nwith Great Britain must necessarily increase one of the great evils of\r\nIreland, by producing depopulation in many parts of the Country, and by\r\nincreasing greatly the number of absentees. I do not mean to deny that\r\nthis effect would, to a limited extent, take place during a part of the\r\nyear; but I think it will not be difficult for me to prove, that this\r\ncircumstance will be more than counterbalanced by the operation of the\r\nsystem in other respects.\r\n\r\nIf it be true that this measure has an inevitable tendency to admit\r\nthe introduction of that British Capital which is most likely to give\r\nlife to all the operations of Commerce, and to all the improvements of\r\nAgriculture; if it be that which above all other considerations is most\r\nlikely to give security, quiet, and internal repose to Ireland; if it\r\nis likely to remove the chief bar to the internal advancement of wealth\r\nand of civilization, by a more intimate intercourse with England; if it\r\nis more likely to communicate from hence those habits which distinguish\r\nthis Country, and which, by a continued gradation, unite the highest\r\nand the lowest orders of the community without a chasm in any part of\r\nthe system; if it is not only likely to invite (as I have already said)\r\nEnglish Capital to set Commerce in motion, but to offer it the use of new\r\nmarkets, to open fresh resources of wealth and industry; can wealth, can\r\nindustry, can civilization increase among the whole bulk of the people\r\nwithout much more than counterbalancing the partial effect of the removal\r\nof the few individuals who, for a small part of the year, would follow\r\nthe seat of Legislation? If, notwithstanding the absence of Parliament\r\nfrom Dublin, it would still remain the centre of Education and of the\r\ninternal commerce of a country increasing in improvement; if it would\r\nstill remain the seat of legal discussion, which must always increase\r\nwith an increase of property and occupation, will it be supposed, with\r\na view even to the interests of those whose partial interests have been\r\nmost successfully appealed to; with a view either to the respectable\r\nBody of the Bar, to the Merchant, or Shopkeeper, of Dublin (if it were\r\npossible to suppose that a transaction of this sort ought to be referred\r\nto that single criterion) that they would not find their proportionate\r\nshare of advantage in the general advantage of the State? Let it be\r\nremembered, also, that if the transfer of the Seat of Legislature may\r\ncall from Ireland to England the Members of the United Parliament,\r\nyet, after the Union, property, influence and consideration in Ireland\r\nwill lead, as much as in Great Britain, to all the objects of imperial\r\nambition; and there must, consequently, exist a new incitement to persons\r\nto acquire property in that Country, and to those who possess it, to\r\nreside there and to cultivate the good opinion of those with whom they\r\nlive, and to extend and improve their influence and connections.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, I need not dwell longer on argument, however it may satisfy\r\nmy own mind, because we can on this question refer to experience. I see\r\nevery Gentleman anticipates that I allude to Scotland. What has been\r\nthe result of the Union there? A Union, give me leave to say, as much\r\nopposed, and by much the same arguments, prejudices, and misconceptions,\r\nas are urged, at this moment, creating too the same alarms, and provoking\r\nthe same outrages, as have lately taken place in Dublin. Look at the\r\nmetropolis of Scotland: the population of Edinburgh has been more\r\nthan doubled since the Union, and a new city added to the old. But we\r\nmay be told, that Edinburgh has engrossed all the commerce of that\r\ncountry, and has those advantages which Dublin cannot expect. Yet while\r\nEdinburgh, deprived of its Parliament, but retaining, as Dublin would\r\nretain, its Courts of Justice; continuing, as Dublin would continue,\r\nthe resort of those whose circumstances would not permit them to visit\r\na distant metropolis; continuing, as Dublin would continue, the seat of\r\nnational education, while Edinburgh has baffled all the predictions of\r\nthat period, what has been the situation of Glasgow? The population of\r\nGlasgow, since the Union, has increased in the proportion of between five\r\nand six to one: look at its progress in manufactures; look at its general\r\nadvantages, and tell me what ground there is, judging by experience\r\nin aid of theory, for those gloomy apprehensions which have been so\r\nindustriously excited.\r\n\r\nThere remains, Sir, another general line of argument, which I have\r\nalready anticipated, and I hope answered, that the commercial privileges\r\nnow enjoyed by Ireland, and to which it owes so much of its prosperity,\r\nwould be less secure than at present. I have given an answer to that\r\nalready, by stating that they are falsely imputed to the independence of\r\nthe Irish Parliament, for that they are in fact owing to the exercise of\r\nthe voluntary discretion of the British Parliament, unbound by compact,\r\nprompted only by its natural disposition to consider the interests of\r\nIreland the same as its own; and if that has been done while Ireland is\r\nonly united to us in the imperfect and precarious manner in which it\r\nis, while it has a separate Parliament, notwithstanding the commercial\r\njealousies of our own manufactures; if under these circumstances we have\r\ndone so, if we have done so with no other connection than that which\r\nnow subsists, and while Ireland has no share in our representation;\r\nwhat fresh ground can there be for apprehension, when she will have her\r\nproportionate weight in the Legislature, and will be united with us as\r\nclosely as Lancashire or Yorkshire, or any other county in Great Britain.\r\n\r\nSir, I have seen it under the same authority to which I am sorry so often\r\nto advert, that the Linen Trade would be injured, and that there will\r\nbe no security for its retaining its present advantages. I have already\r\nstated to you (and with that very authority in my favour) that those\r\nadvantages are at present precarious, and that their security can only\r\narise from Compact with Great Britain. Such a Compact, this Measure would\r\nestablish in the most solemn manner; but besides this, Sir, the natural\r\npolicy of this Country, not merely its experienced liberality, but the\r\nidentity of Interests after a Union, would offer a security worth a\r\nthousand Compacts.\r\n\r\nSir, the only other general topic of objection is that upon which great\r\npains have been taken to raise an alarm in Ireland—the idea that the main\r\nprinciple of the Measure was to subject Ireland to a load of Debt and\r\nan increase of Taxes, and to expose her to the consequences of all our\r\nalleged difficulties and supposed necessities.\r\n\r\nSir, I hope the zeal, the spirit, and the liberal and enlarged policy,\r\nof this Country, has given ample proof that it is not from a pecuniary\r\nmotive that we seek an Union. If it is not desirable on the grounds I\r\nhave stated, it cannot be recommended for the mere purpose of Taxation;\r\nbut to quiet any jealousy on this subject, here again let us look to\r\nScotland: is there any instance where, with 45 Members on her part\r\nand 513 on ours, that part of the United Kingdom has paid more than\r\nits proportion to the general burdens?—Is it then, Sir, any ground of\r\napprehension, that we are likely to tax Ireland more heavily when she\r\nbecomes associated with ourselves?—To tax in its due proportion the whole\r\nof the Empire, to the utter exclusion of the idea of the predominance of\r\none part of society over another, is the great characteristic of British\r\nFinance, as Equality of Laws is of the British Constitution.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, in addition to this, if we come to the details of this\r\nproposition, it is in our power to fix, for any number of years which\r\nshall be thought fit, the proportion by which the Contribution of\r\nIreland, to the expences of the State, shall be regulated; that these\r\nproportions shall not be such as would make a contribution greater than\r\nthe necessary amount of its own present necessary expences as a separate\r\nKingdom; and, even after that limited period, the proportion of the\r\nwhole contribution, from time to time, might be made to depend on the\r\ncomparative produce, in each Kingdom, of such general taxes as might be\r\nthought to afford the best criterion of their respective wealth. Or,\r\nwhat I should hope would be found practicable, the system of internal\r\ntaxation in each country might gradually be so equalized and assimilated,\r\non the leading articles, as to make all rules of specific proportion\r\nunnecessary, and to secure, that Ireland shall never be taxed but in\r\nproportion as we tax ourselves.\r\n\r\nThe application of these principles, however, will form matter of\r\nfuture discussion; I mention them only as strongly shewing, from the\r\nmisrepresentation which has taken place on this part of the subject, how\r\nincumbent it is upon the House to receive these propositions, and to\r\nadopt, after due deliberation, such resolutions as may record to Ireland\r\nthe terms upon which we are ready to meet her. And, in the mean time, let\r\nus wait, not without impatience, but without dissatisfaction, for that\r\nmoment, when the effect of reason and discussion may reconcile the minds\r\nof men, in that Kingdom, to a Measure which I am sure will be found as\r\nnecessary for their peace and happiness, as it will be conducive to the\r\ngeneral security and advantage of the British Empire.\r\n\r\nSir, it remains for me only to lay these Resolutions before the House,\r\nwishing that the more detailed discussion of them may be reserved to a\r\nfuture day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRESOLUTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST.\r\n\r\nThat in order to promote and secure the essential Interests of Great\r\nBritain and Ireland, and to consolidate the Strength, Power, and\r\nResources of the British Empire, it will be advisable to concur in such\r\nmeasures as may best tend to unite the two Kingdoms of Great Britain\r\nand Ireland into one Kingdom, in such manner, and on such Terms and\r\nConditions as may be established by Acts of the respective Parliaments of\r\nHis Majesty’s said Kingdoms.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND.\r\n\r\nThat it appears to this Committee that it would be fit to propose as\r\nthe first Article to serve as a Basis of the said Union, that the said\r\nKingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland shall, upon a day to be agreed\r\nupon, be united into one Kingdom, by the name of the UNITED KINGDOM OF\r\nGREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRD.\r\n\r\nThat for the same purpose it appears also to this Committee, that it\r\nwould be fit to propose that the Succession to the Monarchy and the\r\nImperial Crown of the said United Kingdoms, shall continue limited and\r\nsettled, in the same manner as the Imperial Crown of the said Kingdoms\r\nof Great Britain and Ireland now stands limited and settled, according\r\nto the existing Laws, and to the Terms of the Union between England and\r\nScotland.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOURTH.\r\n\r\nThat for the same purpose it appears also to this Committee, that it\r\nwould be fit to propose that the said United Kingdom be represented in\r\none and the same Parliament, to be stiled the Parliament of the United\r\nKingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and that such a number of Lords\r\nSpiritual and Temporal, and such a number of Members of the House of\r\nCommons as shall be hereafter agreed upon by Acts of the respective\r\nParliaments as aforesaid, shall sit and vote in the said Parliament on\r\nthe part of Ireland, and shall be summoned, chosen and returned, in such\r\nmanner as shall be fixed by an Act of the Parliament of Ireland previous\r\nto the said Union; and that every Member hereafter to sit and vote in the\r\nsaid Parliament of the United Kingdom shall, until the said Parliament\r\nshall otherwise provide, take and subscribe the same Oaths, and make the\r\nsame Declarations as are by Law required to be taken, subscribed and made\r\nby the Members of the Parliaments of Great Britain and Ireland.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIFTH.\r\n\r\nThat for the same purpose it appears also to this Committee, that it\r\nwould be fit to propose that the Churches of England and Ireland, and the\r\nDoctrine, Worship, Discipline, and Government thereof, shall be preserved\r\nas now by Law Established.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIXTH.\r\n\r\nThat for the same purpose it appears also to this Committee, that it\r\nwould be fit to propose that His Majesty’s Subjects in Ireland shall\r\nat all times hereafter be entitled to the same privileges, and be on\r\nthe same footing in respect of Trade and Navigation, in all Ports and\r\nPlaces belonging to Great Britain, and in all cases with respect to which\r\nTreaties shall be made by His Majesty, his Heirs or Successors, with\r\nany Foreign Power, as His Majesty’s Subjects in Great Britain; that no\r\nDuty shall be imposed on the Import or Export between Great Britain and\r\nIreland of any Articles now Duty free; and that on other Articles there\r\nshall be established, for a time to be limited, such a moderate rate of\r\nequal Duties as shall, previous to the Union, be agreed upon and approved\r\nby the respective Parliaments, subject, after the expiration of such\r\nlimited time, to be diminished equally with respect to both Kingdoms,\r\nbut in no case to be encreased; that all Articles which may at any time\r\nhereafter be imported into Great Britain from Foreign Parts, shall be\r\nimportable through either Kingdom into the other, subject to the like\r\nDuties and Regulations as if the same were imported directly from Foreign\r\nParts; that where any Articles, the growth, produce, or manufacture of\r\neither Kingdom, are subject to any internal Duty in one Kingdom, such\r\ncountervailing Duties (over and above any Duties on import to be fixed\r\nas aforesaid) shall be imposed as shall be necessary to prevent any\r\ninequality in that respect: and that all other matters of Trade and\r\nCommerce other than the foregoing, and than such others as may before\r\nthe Union be specially agreed upon for the due encouragement of the\r\nAgriculture and Manufactures of the respective Kingdoms, shall remain to\r\nbe regulated from time to time by the United Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEVENTH.\r\n\r\nThat for the like purpose it would be fit to propose, that the charge\r\narising from the payment of the Interest or Sinking Fund for the\r\nreduction of the Principal of the Debt incurred in either Kingdom before\r\nthe Union, shall continue to be separately defrayed by Great Britain\r\nand Ireland respectively. That for a number of Years to be limited,\r\nthe future ordinary expences of the UNITED KINGDOM, in Peace or War,\r\nshall be defrayed by Great Britain and Ireland jointly, according to\r\nsuch proportions as shall be established by the respective Parliaments\r\nprevious to the Union; and that after the expiration of the time to be\r\nso limited, the proportion shall not be liable to be varied, except\r\naccording to such rates and principles as shall be in like manner agreed\r\nupon previous to the Union.\r\n\r\n\r\nEIGHTH.\r\n\r\nThat for the like purpose it would be fit to propose, that all Laws\r\nin force at the time of the Union, and that all the Courts of Civil\r\nor Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction within the respective Kingdoms, shall\r\nremain as now by Law established within the same, subject only to such\r\nalterations or regulations from time to time as circumstances may appear\r\nto the Parliament of the UNITED KINGDOM to require.\r\n\r\nThat the foregoing RESOLUTIONS be laid before His Majesty with an humble\r\nADDRESS, assuring His Majesty that we have proceeded with the utmost\r\nattention to the consideration of the important objects recommended to us\r\nin His Majesty’s Gracious MESSAGE.\r\n\r\nThat we entertain a firm persuasion that a COMPLETE AND INTIRE UNION\r\nbetween Great Britain and Ireland, founded on equal and liberal\r\nPrinciples, on the similarity of Laws, Constitution and Government, and\r\non a sense of mutual Interests and Affections, by promoting the Security,\r\nWealth, and Commerce of the respective Kingdoms, and by allaying the\r\ndistractions which have unhappily prevailed in Ireland, must afford fresh\r\nmeans of opposing at all times an effectual resistance to the destructive\r\nProjects of our Foreign and Domestic Enemies, and must tend to confirm\r\nand augment the Stability, Power, and Resources of the Empire.\r\n\r\nImpressed with these considerations, we feel it our duty humbly to lay\r\nbefore His Majesty such Propositions as appear to us best calculated\r\nto form the Basis of such a settlement, leaving it to His Majesty’s\r\nwisdom, at such time and in such manner as His Majesty, in his Parental\r\nSolicitude for the happiness of his People, shall judge fit, to\r\ncommunicate these Propositions to His Parliament of Ireland, with whom\r\nwe shall be at all times ready to concur in all such Measures as may be\r\nfound most conducive to the accomplishment of this great and salutary\r\nWork. And we trust that, after full and mature consideration, such a\r\nSettlement may be framed and established, by the deliberate Consent\r\nof the Parliaments of both Kingdoms, as may be conformable to the\r\nSentiments, Wishes, and real Interests of His Majesty’s faithful Subjects\r\nof Great Britain and Ireland, and may unite them inseparably in the full\r\nenjoyment of the blessings of our free and invaluable Constitution, in\r\nthe support of the Honour and Dignity of His Majesty’s Crown, and in the\r\npreservation and advancement of the Welfare and Prosperity of the whole\r\nBritish Empire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The following Message was presented in the House of Commons by Mr. Fox,\r\nSecretary of State, on the 9th of April, 1782._\r\n\r\n    GEORGE R.\r\n\r\n    His Majesty being concerned to find that discontents and\r\n    jealousies are prevailing among his loyal Subjects in Ireland,\r\n    upon matters of great weight and importance, earnestly\r\n    recommends to this House, to take the same into their most\r\n    serious consideration, in order to such a Final Adjustment as\r\n    may give mutual satisfaction to both Kingdoms.\r\n\r\n                                                           G. R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_1st May, 1782._\r\n\r\nMr. Secretary Fox presented to the House, by His Majesty’s command,\r\n\r\nCopy of the Message to the Houses of Lords and Commons in Ireland, from\r\nHis Grace the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, delivered the 16th April, 1782:\r\nAnd also,\r\n\r\nCopy of a Resolution of the House of Lords in Ireland, Mercurii, 17ᵒ die\r\nAprilis, 1782: And also,\r\n\r\nCopy of a Resolution of the House of Commons in Ireland, Martis, 16ᵒ die\r\nAprilis, 1782.\r\n\r\nAnd the Titles of the said Copies were read.\r\n\r\nThe said Copies are as followeth; _viz._\r\n\r\n    _Copy of the Message to the Houses of Lords and Commons in\r\n    Ireland, from His Grace the Lord Lieutenant, delivered the 16th\r\n    April, 1782._\r\n\r\n    PORTLAND,\r\n\r\n    I have it in command from His Majesty, to inform this House,\r\n    that His Majesty being concerned to find that discontents and\r\n    jealousies are prevailing among his loyal Subjects of this\r\n    Country, upon matters of great weight and importance, His\r\n    Majesty recommends to this House to take the same into their\r\n    most serious consideration, in order to such a Final Adjustment\r\n    as may give mutual satisfaction to his Kingdoms of Great\r\n    Britain and Ireland.\r\n\r\n                                                             P.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Copy of a Resolution of the House of Lords in Ireland,\r\n    Mercurii, 17ᵒ die Aprilis, 1782._\r\n\r\n    RESOLVED, By the Lords Spiritual and Temporal in Parliament\r\n    assembled _Nemine dissentiente_, That an humble Address be\r\n    presented to His Majesty, to return him our thanks for the most\r\n    gracious Message sent to this House by His Majesty’s command,\r\n    through the medium of His Grace the Lord Lieutenant, and to\r\n    assure him of our most unshaken loyalty and attachment to\r\n    His Majesty’s person and government, and of the lively sense\r\n    we entertain of his paternal care of his people of Ireland,\r\n    in thus inquiring into the discontents and jealousies that\r\n    subsist amongst them, in order to such Final Adjustment as may\r\n    give mutual satisfaction to his Kingdoms of Great Britain and\r\n    Ireland.\r\n\r\n    That, thus encouraged by His Royal Interposition, we shall beg\r\n    leave, with all duty and affection, to lay before His Majesty\r\n    the cause of such discontents and jealousies.\r\n\r\n    To represent to His Majesty, That his subjects of Ireland are\r\n    entitled to a free constitution; that the Imperial Crown of\r\n    Ireland is inseparably annexed to the Crown of Great Britain,\r\n    on which Connection the happiness of both nations essentially\r\n    depends; but that the Kingdom of Ireland is a distinct\r\n    dominion, having a Parliament of her own, the sole Legislature\r\n    thereof.\r\n\r\n    That there is no power whatsoever competent to make laws to\r\n    bind this nation, except the King, Lords, and Commons, of\r\n    Ireland; upon which exclusive Right of Legislation we consider\r\n    the very essence of our liberties to depend, a Right which we\r\n    claim as the Birth-right of the People of Ireland, and which\r\n    we are determined, in every situation of life, to assert and\r\n    maintain.\r\n\r\n    To represent to His Majesty, That we have seen with concern\r\n    certain claims, both of legislature and judicature, asserted\r\n    by the Parliament of Great Britain, in an Act passed in Great\r\n    Britain in the sixth year of George the First, intituled “An\r\n    Act for the better securing the Dependency of Ireland upon the\r\n    Crown of Great Britain:”\r\n\r\n    That we conceive the said Act, and the powers thereby claimed,\r\n    to be the great and principal causes of the discontents and\r\n    jealousies that subsist in this Kingdom:\r\n\r\n    To assure His Majesty, That this House considers it as a matter\r\n    of constitutional right and protection, that all Bills which\r\n    become Law should receive the approbation of His Majesty, under\r\n    the Seal of Great Britain; but we consider the practice of\r\n    suppressing our Bills in the Council of Ireland, or altering\r\n    them any where, to be a matter which calls for redress:\r\n\r\n    To represent to His Majesty, That an Act intituled “An Act\r\n    for the better Accommodation of His Majesty’s Forces,”\r\n    being unlimited in duration, but which, from the particular\r\n    circumstances of the times, passed into a law, has been the\r\n    cause of much jealousy and discontent in this Kingdom;\r\n\r\n    That we have thought it our duty to lay before His Majesty\r\n    these, the principal causes of the discontents and jealousies\r\n    subsisting in this Kingdom:\r\n\r\n    That we have the greatest reliance on His Majesty’s wisdom,\r\n    the most sanguine expectations from his virtuous choice of a\r\n    Chief Governor, and the greatest confidence in the wise and\r\n    constitutional Council His Majesty has adopted:\r\n\r\n    That we have, moreover, a high sense and veneration for\r\n    the British Character, and do therefore conceive, that the\r\n    proceedings of this country, founded as they are in right, and\r\n    supported by constitutional liberty, must have excited the\r\n    approbation and esteem of the British nation: That we are the\r\n    more confirmed in this hope, inasmuch as the people of this\r\n    Kingdom have never expressed a desire to share the freedom\r\n    of Great Britain, without at the same time declaring their\r\n    determination to share her fate, standing or falling with the\r\n    British nation.\r\n\r\n                              Wm. Watts Gayer } Cler. Parliament.\r\n                              Edw. Gayer      }\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Copy of a Resolution of the House of Commons in Ireland,\r\n    Martis, 16ᵒ die Aprilis, 1782._\r\n\r\n    RESOLVED, That an humble Address be presented to His Majesty,\r\n    to return His Majesty the thanks of this House for his most\r\n    gracious message to this House, signified by his Grace the Lord\r\n    Lieutenant. To assure His Majesty of our unshaken attachment to\r\n    His Majesty’s Person and Government, and of our lively sense\r\n    of his Paternal Care, in thus taking the lead to administer\r\n    content to His Majesty’s subjects of Ireland; that thus\r\n    encouraged by his royal interposition, we shall beg leave, with\r\n    all duty and affection, to lay before His Majesty the causes\r\n    of our discontents and jealousies: To assure His Majesty,\r\n    that his subjects of Ireland are a free People; that the Crown\r\n    of Ireland is an Imperial Crown, inseparably annexed to the\r\n    Crown of Great Britain, on which Connection the interests and\r\n    happiness of both Nations essentially depend; but that the\r\n    kingdom of Ireland is a distinct Kingdom, with a Parliament of\r\n    her own, the sole Legislature thereof; that there is no body\r\n    of men competent to make Laws to bind this nation, except the\r\n    King, Lords, and Commons of Ireland, nor any other Parliament\r\n    which hath any authority or power of any sort whatsoever in\r\n    this country, save only the Parliament of Ireland: To assure\r\n    His Majesty, that we humbly conceive, that in this Right\r\n    the very Essence of our Liberties exist; a Right which we,\r\n    on the part of all the People of Ireland, do claim as their\r\n    birth-right, and which we cannot yield but with our lives: To\r\n    assure His Majesty, that we have seen with concern certain\r\n    Claims advanced by the Parliament of Great Britain, in an act,\r\n    intituled, “An Act for the better securing the Dependency of\r\n    Ireland;” an act containing matter entirely irreconcileable to\r\n    the fundamental Rights of this Nation; that we consider this\r\n    act, and the claims it advances, to be the great and principle\r\n    cause of the discontents and jealousies in this Kingdom: To\r\n    assure His Majesty, that His Majesty’s Commons of Ireland do\r\n    most sincerely wish, that all Bills which become Law in Ireland\r\n    should receive the approbation of His Majesty, under the Seal\r\n    of Great Britain; but that yet we do consider the Practice of\r\n    suppressing our Bills in the Council of Ireland, or altering\r\n    the same any where, to be another just cause of discontent and\r\n    jealousy: To assure His Majesty, that an Act, intituled, “An\r\n    Act for the better Accommodation of His Majesty’s Forces,”\r\n    being unlimited in duration, and defective in other instances\r\n    (but passed in that shape from the particular circumstances of\r\n    the times) is another just cause of discontent and jealousy\r\n    in this Kingdom: That we have submitted these, the principal\r\n    causes of the present discontent and jealousy in Ireland, and\r\n    remain in humble expectation of redress; that we have the\r\n    greatest reliance on His Majesty’s wisdom, the most sanguine\r\n    expectations from his virtuous choice of a Chief Governor, and\r\n    great confidence in the wise, auspicious, and constitutional\r\n    councils which we see with satisfaction His Majesty has\r\n    adopted; that we have moreover a high sense and veneration for\r\n    the British character, and do therefore conceive, that the\r\n    proceedings of this country, founded as they are in right, and\r\n    tempered by duty, must have excited the approbation and esteem,\r\n    instead of wounding the pride, of the British Nation; and we\r\n    beg leave to assure His Majesty, that we are the more confirmed\r\n    in this hope, in as much as the people of this Kingdom have\r\n    never expressed a desire to share the freedom of England,\r\n    without declaring a determination to share her fate likewise,\r\n    standing and falling with the British nation.\r\n\r\n                              THO.
