STOCKDALE,\r\n  OPPOSITE BURLINGTON-HOUSE, PICCADILLY.\r\n  MDCC LXXXIV.\r\n\r\n  Entered at Stationers' Hall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROPER\r\n\r\nLIMITS\r\n\r\nOF THE\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT'S Interference with the Affairs of the EAST-INDIA COMPANY,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\n\r\nEach day's experience proves the fallibility of conjecture, even when\r\nestablished on apparently the surest foundations.\r\n\r\nHaving stated, indeed materially and substantially proved, that the\r\nannual peace expenditure of the state, if decently, not profusely, nor\r\neven amply provided for, could not be performed for less than sixteen\r\nmillions five hundred thousand pounds; and having asserted, with truth,\r\nthat the annual receipts have scarcely, on the most productive years of\r\nthe public revenue, exceeded twelve millions; and the necessary\r\ncorollary, arising out of these propositions, being an annual surplus or\r\nsinking fund to the amount (if at all proportional) of at least fifteen\r\nhundred thousand pounds, as a provision for great civil emergencies or\r\nfuture wars, without which no system of finance can be either\r\nrespectable or assuredly permanent; and it following of necessary\r\nconsequence from these premises, that the proper peace revenue, from\r\nsomething more than twelve millions, which is its present amount, ought\r\nto be raised to eighteen millions yearly:--these matters, I say, being\r\nas I have represented them, I firmly believed the public affairs of this\r\ncountry were tolerably embarrassed, and weakly imagined Ministers might\r\nfind full employment in extricating them, without courting, and eagerly,\r\nthrough right and through wrong, aspiring and grasping at the management\r\nof affairs fully in as great a state of confusion as our own. But I find\r\nI greatly under-rated the cravings of the appetite of our late rulers,\r\nwho seem to have had stomach for all difficulties, however remote from\r\nthe natural and needful course of their public functions, and however\r\naverse the parties interested were to trust their concerns to their\r\ndirection. In consequence of this canine hunger and thirst after\r\nregulation, a bill was brought in and passed by a very great majority of\r\nthe House of Commons, to virtually consolidate the embarrassed concerns\r\nof the East-India Company, in direct opposition to the desires of the\r\nproprietors, with the no less embarrassed affairs of this unhappy\r\ncountry. This bill has been thrown out by a wise and virtuous majority\r\nin the House of Peers; but as the majority there was but small, and\r\nthreats are thrown out (in order to make it still smaller) against\r\nPeers, for exercising their indispensable distinctive prerogative duty\r\nof giving honest counsel to their King; and as the same majority,\r\nleagued to promote their own advancement and the ruin of the state,\r\nstill exists and exults in the House of Commons; I doubt not but the\r\nsame strange destructive measure will be resumed. It therefore becomes\r\nthe business of every well-wisher to the prosperity of Britain, to\r\noppose and to refute the specious nothings offered to blind and to\r\nconceal from the public the designs of a dark and fatal tendency\r\nattached to it; and I think it my duty, moreover, and a justice due to\r\nthe creditors of the public in particular, at least, to such as shall\r\nadhere to me, to protest and enter my dissent in their name against any\r\nincrease of the public debt, by the addition and incorporation of the\r\ndebts of the East-India Company with those of the public, in any manner,\r\nwhether openly, or by implication and management.\r\n\r\nI now proceed to consider the reasons offered in vindication of the bill\r\nby which so daring a violation of every thing the laws hold most sacred\r\nwas attempted.\r\n\r\nThe first plea that was insisted on, was, that the Company was bankrupt;\r\nbut this argument defeats itself. If they are bankrupt, the law has\r\nprovided a due course of proceeding: Ministers, or the Deputies of\r\nMinisters, are not the proper assignees to the bankrupt's estate: the\r\ntrade is, moreover, by the civil death of the Company, open to every\r\nadventurer. But this pretext of bankruptcy is but a flimsy disguise\r\neasily seen through: Ministers are not so eager to obtain the\r\nadministration of the affairs of a bankrupt: the virtuous majority in\r\nthe House of Commons, increased without any visible cause, or known\r\nsuccess, or advantage of any kind, real or pretended, obtained to the\r\npublic from the cares of the late administration;--increased, I say,\r\nfrom a small doubtful few in the disapprobation of the peace, to a\r\nsteady, triumphant majority of one hundred and fourteen in the business\r\nof the East-India Company; gives no note or appearance of a present\r\nbankruptcy in the Company's affairs; but to those that do not know the\r\nincorruptible integrity and disinterestedness of the British legislative\r\nbodies, gives an ugly hint and surmise of what is likely to happen in\r\nfuture. Of bankruptcy I need say no more; it confutes itself.\r\n\r\nThe next plea is humanity, and a wish to restore in India a better and a\r\njuster system of government, less rapacious, and less oppressive to the\r\nnatives. This is certainly a fair and generous object; but how do the\r\nmeans correspond with the end, or, what solid proof have we that\r\nexcesses do exist, or, at least, have been carried to the singular and\r\nunnatural extent each parliamentary declaimer is pleased to assign to\r\nthem? Having forced the Company to bear a share in all the foolish wars\r\nBritain involved herself in, money must be found. The smooth swindling\r\nmethods of funding, without giving the creditors adequate securities\r\nfor either principal or interest, are not practicable in Cina.\r\nSelf-preservation enforced the necessity of violence, more obnoxious in\r\nthe beginning, but, perhaps, in the end, less ruinous than the soft, sly\r\ndeceits of Europe. Those violent measures, palliated by the necessity of\r\nself-preservation, excepted, what remains but an _ex parte_ charge, in\r\nReports to the House of Commons, curious and voluminous indeed, but\r\nwithout confrontation of the accused, or any other necessary preliminary\r\nto condemnation, sought by private equity, or required by public\r\njustice? We have only an inform mass of matter, where disappointment,\r\nvanity, and malevolence, are too often prompted by management and design\r\nto accuse, and every accusation is held forth as compleat evidence of\r\nguilt. Indeed, some accounts scattered through the vast abyss of eastern\r\nmanners and customs, make by much the most useful and entertaining part\r\nof this exceedingly tedious farrago; though in this part it falls far\r\nshort in beauty of style and composition, and probably does not much\r\nexceed in veracity, the Arabian Night's Entertainments.--But grant that\r\nwrongs and injustice predominate, who are to restore the golden age in\r\nIndia? We know the late Ministry, their habitudes, and connections; from\r\nBrooks's, then, it is fair to suppose the daring Argonauts were to have\r\nsailed in search of the Golden Fleece: from Almack's our bold Pizarros\r\nmust have taken their course to civilize our new-acquired ministerial\r\nPeru. Determined minds used to set fame and fortune on the dies\r\nuncertain cast: soft souls, overflowing with Christian forbearance, and\r\nthe milk of human kindness suckt in at the gaming-table, from such\r\napostles, alas! I rather should suspect,\r\n\r\n    With Ate by their side, come hot from hell,\r\n    Shall in these confines, with a monarch's voice,\r\n    Cry havoc! and let slip the dogs of war.\r\n\r\nYet I readily agree that it may be proper to send out a well-chosen\r\ncommission of visitation and inspection, with adequate and efficient\r\npowers from Parliament; though I am greatly deceived, if they do not\r\nfind that matters are much exaggerated. The Reports to the House of\r\nCommons from Committees are generally very false mediums to view the\r\nobject they treat of through: they are moved for common by persons\r\ninterested in the event, sedulously attended by them, and the materials\r\nare too often modelled and made up according to their views, and to\r\nserve their purposes. I have therefore ever greatly regretted the\r\nabolition of the board of trade, the fair, candid judges in these\r\nmatters, or who might be made so. The argument from the abuse to the\r\nuse, is not a fair consequence; and I sincerely and earnestly recommend\r\nthe re-establishment of that board. From the revenues of the Duchy Court\r\nof Lancaster now vacant, and a small gleaning from the enormous\r\novergrown sine-cures in the Exchequer, this may be done without expence,\r\nand with great emolument to the Crown and to the public.\r\n\r\nIt is, besides, the height of absurdity, to think the Indians are\r\nunhappy because they do not live under the same constitution as the\r\ninhabitants of this island. The government in that country, for a very\r\nlong period of time, has been so unsettled, that no form of it that has\r\nany stability, or affords any degree of protection to the subjects that\r\nlive under it, can be pronounced to be a bad one: in every other case,\r\nthe weaker are almost sure to be exterminated by those that are\r\nstronger.\r\n\r\nI should esteem it, in such uncertainty of doing any good of any kind,\r\nextremely improper for the public to make a common cause with the\r\nEast-India Company, further than I have already stated, and likewise by\r\nassisting them with some necessary pecuniary aid in their present\r\ndistress. The consequences of the public taking upon themselves the\r\ndirection of the Company's trade, or even of their territorial\r\nacquisitions, I apprehend would be most ruinous. No nation has ever\r\nattempted any thing of this kind without being greatly losers by it,\r\neven where government was carried on principles infinitely more\r\nfavourable to such an enterprise than the free constitution of this\r\ncountry admits of.\r\n\r\nFrance has often been compelled, in order to preserve the trade to India\r\nand their Companies from sinking, to interfere, and I believe is still\r\nconcerned in the national trade to India; but this is on mere compulsion\r\nand necessity, and is, and has ever been, a very losing business to the\r\nCrown of France. If this is so, then how much worse must it be here,\r\nwhere the advantages taken of the public in every public business are\r\nenormous: and indeed the uncertainty of the time of payment, and the\r\ndifficulty of passing the account, do warrant a demand of a great\r\nlatitude at any time; but at present, when the ordnance debentures are\r\nat 30 per cent. discount, and the navy bills, which carry an interest\r\nof 4 per cent. are at 17 per cent. discount, it is almost impossible to\r\nsay on what terms a contract with Government would be advantageous. In\r\nmore settled times, I believe, 25 per cent. on estimate, and near 50 per\r\ncent. on arbitrary statements, did not vary much from the difference, to\r\nthe disadvantage of the public, betwixt public and private contracts for\r\nthe same performances.\r\n\r\nIn this view, and it is a just one, nothing but absolute necessity, and\r\nthe sure consequence of losing the trade altogether, could justify the\r\ninterference of Government beyond the limits already assigned, if even\r\nthese could justify it. But this necessity is happily entirely out of\r\nthe question at present: the Company anxiously desire to go on with\r\ntheir trade: a forbearance of duties due, is all they ask, to the\r\nextent of, I think, a million. If it was three times as much, Government\r\nwould be mad, if they hesitated in the alternative betwixt indulging\r\nthem in their demand, and taking their concerns into their own hands.\r\nThe affairs of the Company have been embarrassed before; they have\r\nborrowed large sums from Government, which they have honestly repaid.\r\nTheir surplus in peaceable times is very large; and if tranquility is\r\nany way durable in India, and the administration of the Company's\r\naffairs is continued in the hands of that powerful genius of resource,\r\nMr. Hastings, I make no doubt they will extricate themselves with\r\nhonour, and do justice to every creditor they have. I am at least sure,\r\nthat this is giving the only chance of making them beneficial to this\r\ncountry; and it is what the Company is highly entitled to.\r\n\r\nI have often wondered upon what principle of policy one of our two great\r\ncommercial companies should be the _enfant gale_, the spoilt child of\r\nevery administration whilst the other was treated like the step-son of\r\nthe state, with every mark of jealousy and unkindness. The merits of the\r\nEast-India Company towards the nation are great and notorious. Whilst\r\nevery other country has been taxing their subjects, in order to support\r\ntheir East-India trade, the English East-India Company has been the\r\nsupport, to a good extent directly, and in a very great and eminent\r\ndegree indirectly, of the British finances; and in the late war the\r\nCompany maintained alone, in their dominions and enterprises, the\r\nsuperiority which usually attended the British arms in every quarter of\r\nthe globe; and at last, in the acquisitions made by the Company's arms,\r\nthe material indispensable sacrifices to procure a necessary peace were\r\nfound. Indeed, their expences in the reduction of Pondicherry, and the\r\nvalue of it, and of the other restitutions made to the French by the\r\ndefinitive treaty of peace, seem to me a very onerous and most just debt\r\non Britain, and why they are not stated as such by the Company, I cannot\r\nsee any shadow of a reason.\r\n\r\nIt was under the direction of their own proprietary, uncontrouled by\r\nparliament, that the Company rose to an unexampled height of wealth and\r\nprosperity: since the interference of parliament, their affairs have\r\ndeclined. Possibly now the patronage is so valuable and extensive, their\r\nconstitution may be defective, by the too immediate dependence of the\r\ndirectors on the proprietors, who, by their brigues and cabals, overawe,\r\nand often make abortive the best intentions of the directors. But\r\nmatters of charter and property are of so difficult and delicate a\r\nnature, that it is hard to say, whether any attempt to remedy this might\r\nnot do more harm than good.\r\n\r\nIt is related, that Monsieur Colbert, Lewis the Fourteenth's very able\r\nminister of commerce and finance, and to whose memory France stands much\r\nindebted, called an assembly of the most eminent men in the French\r\nking's dominions in the commercial line, to whom he proposed the\r\nconsideration, if any, and what advantages might accrue to commerce by\r\nthe interference of Government. The unanimous answer of the assembly\r\nwas, _Laisser le faire_, let it alone.\r\n\r\nA new doctrine has been likewise attempted to be established in favour\r\nof the late India Bill, viz. That measures are not to be so fully and\r\nfairly canvassed as they ought, but are to rely and be supported by the\r\nresponsibility of the proposer of them. The presumption and absurdity of\r\nsuch a proposition is too great to require an answer. The responsibility\r\nof the proposer often would not procure him ten pounds; and as to any\r\nthing sanguinary, God knows! the hazard is very, very trifling. Indeed,\r\nthe persons who avowedly, first by denial of justice to America, plunged\r\nus into a war, and afterwards, by obstinately persevering in it, when\r\nexperience had evinced the success was impracticable, and who by so\r\ndoing have irretrievably (I fear) undone their country, enjoy in pomp\r\nand serenity, even to ostentation, the honours and lucrative employments\r\nheaped upon them. If justice is demanded for glory, for wealth, for\r\ndominion lost, they pay you with an ideal jest: if you want more, a\r\nready vote of acquittal is at hand from a packt majority, united on the\r\nmost sordid principles, to promote each other's advantage, in open and\r\nabandoned violation, on one part of the coalition, of the faith a\r\nthousand times pledged to bring delinquents to justice, who now are not\r\nonly protected, but represented, with a falsehood and inconsistency that\r\ndegrades human nature, as great, wise, and virtuous ministers, by those\r\nvery men who not very many months stigmatized them as the base undoers\r\nof their country.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty has, however, been pleased to nominate a new ministry: they\r\nare young and untried: I wish them well; and my poor support shall be\r\ntheirs, if they deserve it. I hope their real essential bond of union is\r\nat least less dangerous than that of their predecessors, viz. through\r\nviolation of charters to obtain the plunder of India for themselves and\r\nadherents.\r\n\r\nI should have thought a dissolution of Parliament necessary to have\r\npreceded, in order to procure any stability in the settlement of a new\r\nministry. The reason offered against this measure was quite trifling,\r\nviz. the delay of public business; for the Parliament would have been\r\ndissolved, and a new one elected, in little more than the period of\r\nusual recess at this time of the year; which recess was not intended to\r\nhave been shortened, if the late overthrow of the ministry had not taken\r\nplace. Should the indecent interruption of every thing that does not\r\npromote their own continuance, still prevail in a majority of the House\r\nof Commons, the delay of public business will be well compensated by the\r\nfacilities a new election will probably afford, and by the rapid\r\nprogress of measures beneficial and necessary to the public that will\r\ntake place hereafter, which, under the present jarring situation and\r\nequipoise of parties, cannot, in my poor opinion, ever be carried on\r\nwith either certainty or dispatch.\r\n\r\nBut I still dread the continuance of the present distractions. The\r\npolitics of St. James's have had ill luck for common, and, by some fatal\r\nascendancy, have generally backwards trod the very paths they most\r\nanxiously sought to shun. The faction has emissaries spread far and wide\r\nto pluck allegiance from men's hearts. It will demand, on the part of\r\nthe King, an active, unremitting attention to replace himself in that\r\nstate of pre-eminence and influence the constitution allows, and even\r\nrequires. Let this never be out of mind. When his Majesty hunts the\r\nstag, let him reflect that he is himself the hunted stag, the royal\r\nhart held at bay by a fierce, unrelenting faction, who deny, or mean to\r\nexplain away, his dearest, clearest prerogatives. A prince so virtuous,\r\nwho never was even suspected to mean any foul play to the state, ought\r\nto command in every honest service, and he will command no other, those\r\nservants whom he is now obliged to sue to, and often is refused. The\r\nonward path, ingenuous openness of fair sincerity and prudent oeconomy\r\nin private life, lead to peace of mind, and to heaven's best gift,\r\nindependence; they martial kings to greatness, to awe, and affectionate\r\nveneration. I know the delicate ground I tread; but I owe much to my\r\nsovereign, and, above all, TRUTH; and I will pay the debt, tho' the most\r\nungrateful office, yet the surest pledge of real love and respect that I\r\ncan give. What have I to fear? I have lived too long; I never wished to\r\nsurvive the glory of my country; and I cannot form a wish so mean as to\r\nsurvive its liberties. Whig as I am, if liberty must expire, I hold its\r\nCuthanaria to be in a mild despotism. But in all the bills of mortality,\r\nof human grandeur, never sure was so strange a catastrophe recorded, as\r\na king taken prisoner, and a great and glorious constitution squirted to\r\ndeath, by the sportings of a set of prodigal, undone, gambling,\r\nfriblish, impudent Eton boys.\r\n\r\n  _Jan. 1. 1784._\r\n\r\n\r\nFINIS.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's Notes:\r\n\r\nThe transcriber made these changes to the text to correct obvious\r\nerrors:\r\n\r\n  1. p.  3 Stationers Hall  --> Stationers' Hall\r\n  2. p.  9 brankrupt --> bankrupt\r\n  3. p. 12 securites --> securities\r\n  4. p. 19 tranquiility --> tranquility\r\n\r\nEnd of Transcriber's Notes]",
