Her electoral vote was cast for John Bell and\r\nEdward Everett, who represented, as their platform expressed it, “no\r\npolitical principle other than the Constitution of the country, the\r\nUnion of the States, and the enforcement of the laws.”\r\n\r\nThe first step toward secession was not the result of popular\r\ninitiative, but was mainly due to the efforts of the Governor of the\r\nState, Isham G. Harris. Governor Harris had entered public life just\r\nafter the rupture between Andrew Jackson and Hugh Lawson White, which\r\nhad resulted in the formation, in Tennessee, of the Whig party. For\r\nthirty years the Whigs and Democrats contended for the control of the\r\nState. They were so equally matched that victory often turned upon the\r\nindividual strength of the candidate. This resulted in the development\r\nof a class of public men who possessed, in a high degree, the usually\r\ndivergent abilities of public speakers and party leaders. From this\r\nschool of practical politics were graduated James K. Polk, Cave\r\nJohnson, Felix Grundy, John Bell, and Andrew Johnson.\r\n\r\nThe contest between the Whigs and Democrats, which was at first merely\r\na personal quarrel, soon ripened into a division along true party\r\nlines. The Democrats, after the death of Andrew Jackson, joined the\r\nnational Democratic party in its struggle for the perpetuation and\r\nextension of slavery. The Whigs on the other hand shared in the broad\r\npolicies and national aspirations of the national Whig party.\r\n\r\nGovernor Harris had at the very beginning of his career allied himself\r\nwith the Democrats. As early as 1849, he had been elected to Congress,\r\nwhere he became conspicuous for his advocacy of extreme State rights.\r\nIn 1857 he defeated Neil S. Brown for governor, and was re-elected in\r\n1859. It was not difficult to predict what his action would be in the\r\ncrisis of 1860. Immediately after the election of President Lincoln,\r\nhe issued a call for an extra session of the Legislature. It convened\r\non the seventh day of January, and on the same day he sent in his\r\nmessage. This message is worthy of study, as it has been pronounced by\r\na distinguished writer to be “the ablest and most succinct as well as\r\nthe most intelligent presentation and justification of the reasons for\r\nthe action of the seceding States.”[1] It began with the following\r\ndescription of the crisis confronting the State: “The long,\r\nsystematic, and wanton agitation of the slavery question, with actual\r\nand threatened aggressions of the Northern States and a portion of\r\ntheir people upon the well-defined constitutional rights of the\r\nSouthern citizens, the rapid increase of a purely sectional party,\r\nwhose bond of union is uncompromising hostility to the rights and\r\ninstitutions of the fifteen Southern States, have produced a condition\r\nin the affairs of the country unparalleled in the history of the past,\r\nresulting already in the withdrawal from the Confederacy of one of the\r\nsovereignties which compose it, while others are rapidly preparing to\r\nmove in the same direction.”[2]\r\n\r\nThis opening statement was followed by an historical review in which\r\nwas traced the growth of the Republican party. The offences it had\r\ncommitted against the Southern States were then enumerated. Among\r\nother things, he said:\r\n\r\n     “It has sought to appropriate to itself, and to exclude the\r\n     slaveholders from, the territory acquired by the common\r\n     blood and treasure of all. It has, through the\r\n     instrumentality of the Emigrants’ Aid Society under State\r\n     patronage, flooded the territories with its minions armed\r\n     with Sharp’s rifles and bowie knives, seeking thus to\r\n     accomplish by intimidation, violence, and murder what it\r\n     could not do by constitutional means.\r\n\r\n     “It claimed the constitutional right to abolish slavery in\r\n     the District of Columbia, the forts, arsenals, dock-yards,\r\n     and other places ceded to the United States within the\r\n     bounds of the slaveholding States. It proposed a prohibition\r\n     of the slave-trade between the States, thereby crowding the\r\n     slaves together, and preventing the exit south until they\r\n     became unprofitable to such an extent that it would force\r\n     the owner finally to abandon them in self-defence. It has,\r\n     by the deliberate legislative enactments of a large majority\r\n     of the Northern States, openly and flagrantly nullified the\r\n     clause of the Constitution which provided for the return of\r\n     fugitive slaves.\r\n\r\n     “It has, through the executive authority of the States,\r\n     denied the extradition of murderers and marauders.\r\n\r\n     “It obtained its own compromise in the Constitution to\r\n     continue the importation of slaves, and now sets up a higher\r\n     law than the Constitution to destroy the property imported\r\n     and sold to us by their fathers.\r\n\r\n     “It has caused the murder of owners in the pursuit of the\r\n     fugitive slave, and shielded from punishment the murderers.\r\n\r\n     “It has on many occasions sent its emissaries into the\r\n     Southern States to corrupt our slaves, induce them to run\r\n     off, and excite them to insurrection. It has by its John\r\n     Brown and Montgomery raids invaded sovereign States and\r\n     murdered peaceful citizens. It has justified and exalted to\r\n     highest honors of admiration the horrid murders, arsons, and\r\n     rapines of the John Brown raid, and canonized the felons as\r\n     saints and martyrs.\r\n\r\n     “It has burned the towns, poisoned the cattle, and conspired\r\n     with the slaves to depopulate Northern Texas. In has through\r\n     certain leaders proclaimed to the slaves the terrible motto:\r\n     ‘Alarm to the sleep, fire to the dwellings, and poison to\r\n     the food and water of the slaveholders.’\r\n\r\n     “It has repudiated the decision of the Supreme Court.\r\n\r\n     “It has assailed our rights, guaranteed by the plainest\r\n     provisions of the Constitution, from the floor of each House\r\n     of Congress, the pulpit, the hustings, the schoolroom, their\r\n     State Legislatures, and through the public press, dividing\r\n     churches, and disrupting political parties and civil\r\n     government.”\r\n\r\nThe party that had committed the offences enumerated was in possession\r\nof the House of Representatives, and had elected one of its leaders to\r\nthe presidency, and in the progress of events the Supreme Court and\r\nSenate must also pass into its hands. With such a party in power,\r\nGovernor Harris contended that the Union could be preserved only on\r\nthe condition that certain amendments to the Constitution should be\r\nadopted, which would put slavery beyond its attacks.\r\n\r\nThe amendments he suggested were:\r\n\r\n1. Establish a line upon the northern boundary of the present slave\r\nStates, extend it through the territories to the Pacific Ocean, upon\r\nsuch parallel of latitude as will divide them equitably between North\r\nand South, expressly providing that all territory now owned, or that\r\nmay be hereafter acquired, north of said line shall be forever free,\r\nand south of it forever slave.\r\n\r\n2. In addition to the fugitive-slave clause, provide, that, whenever a\r\nslave has been demanded of the executive authority of the State to\r\nwhich he has fled, and is not delivered, and the owner permitted to\r\ncarry him out of the State in peace, the State so failing to deliver\r\nshall pay to the owner double the value of such slave, and secure his\r\nright of action in the Supreme Court.\r\n\r\n3. Provide for the protection of the owner in the peaceable possession\r\nof his slave while in transition or temporarily sojourning in any of\r\nthe States of the Confederacy, and, in the event of the slave’s\r\nescaping or being taken from the owner, require the State to return,\r\nor account for, him as in the case of a fugitive.\r\n\r\n4. Especially prohibit Congress from abolishing slavery in the\r\nDistrict of Columbia, in any dock-yard, navy-yard, arsenal, or any\r\ndistrict of any character whatever, within the limits of any slave\r\nState.\r\n\r\n5. Provide that these amendments shall never be changed except by\r\nconsent of all the slave States.\r\n\r\nWith these amendments to the Constitution, Governor Harris said that\r\nhe could feel that the rights of the Southern States were reasonably\r\nsecure, not only in theory, but in fact, and should indulge the hope\r\nof living in the Union in peace. “If the non-slaveholding States\r\nrefuse to comply with a demand so just and reasonable; refuse to\r\nabandon at once and forever their unjust war upon us, our\r\ninstitutions, and our rights; refuse, as they have heretofore done to\r\nperform, in good faith, the obligations of the compact of the Union,\r\nmuch as we appreciate the power, prosperity, and glory of this\r\ngovernment, deeply as we deplore the existence of the causes which\r\nhave already driven one State out of the Union, much as we regret the\r\nimperative necessity which they have wantonly and wickedly forced upon\r\nus, every consideration of self-preservation and self-respect requires\r\nthat we should assert and maintain our equality in the Union, or our\r\nindependence out of it.”\r\n\r\nThe message closed with the following recommendation to the\r\nLegislature: “I recommend that you provide by law for submitting to\r\nthe people of the State the question of Convention or No Convention;\r\nand also the election of delegates by the people to meet in State\r\nConvention at the Capitol at Nashville, at the earliest day\r\npracticable, to take into consideration our federal relations, and\r\ndetermine what action shall be taken by the State of Tennessee for the\r\nsecurity of the rights and the peace of her citizens. This will place\r\nthe whole matter in the hands of the people, for them, in their\r\nsovereignty, to determine how far their rights have been violated, the\r\ncharacter of the redress or guaranty they will demand, or the action\r\nthey will take for their present and future security.”\r\n\r\nThe Legislature proceeded without delay to put into effect the\r\nrecommendations contained in Governor Harris’s message. On January\r\n19th it passed an act known as the Convention Bill,[3] which provided\r\nfor submitting the question of holding a convention to the vote of the\r\npeople. The convention was to take into consideration the relation\r\nbetween the government of the United States and the people of the\r\nState, and was to have the power to adopt any measures for vindicating\r\nthe sovereignty of the State and the people it saw fit.\r\n\r\nOnly a few days intervened between the passage of the Convention Bill\r\nand the day appointed for taking the popular vote; nevertheless, an\r\nexciting canvass of the State ensued. The people came together in vast\r\ncrowds to hear the question debated. The Whig leaders were almost\r\nunanimous in their opposition. They were joined by the Democrats of\r\nEast Tennessee. The vote was taken on the fifth of February, 1861. The\r\nresult was: 24,749 for the Convention; and, 91,803 against it.\r\n\r\nThis defeat put a stop for the moment to all official action, as the\r\nLegislature had adjourned, but the public agitation and discussion\r\ncontinued. The disunion sentiment began to grow very rapidly as a\r\nresult of events which were transpiring outside the State. Amid the\r\nintense excitement which followed the taking of Fort Sumter, Governor\r\nHarris issued a call for a second extra session of the Legislature. On\r\nthe 18th of April he had replied to President Lincoln’s call for\r\ntroops: “Tennessee will not furnish a single man for coercion, but\r\nfifty thousand, if necessary, for the defence of our rights and those\r\nof our Southern brothers.”\r\n\r\nThe Legislature convened on the twenty-seventh of April. The public\r\nwere excluded from its meeting, and its members were pledged to\r\nsecrecy. The session opened with the reading of the gubernatorial\r\nmessage,[4] which asserted that the President of the United States had\r\nwantonly inaugurated an internecine war upon the people of the slave\r\nStates. “This war,” he said, “is likely to assume an importance,\r\nnearly, if not equal to the struggle of our revolutionary fathers in\r\ntheir patriotic efforts to resist usurpations and throw off the\r\ntyrannical yoke of the British Government.\r\n\r\n“This declaration of war upon the South has virtually dissolved the\r\nUnion. It will be idle to speak of ourselves any longer as members of\r\nthe Federal Union; and it is believed by many whose opinions are\r\nentitled to the highest respect, that, by reason of the subversion of\r\nthe Constitution by the authorities in power, inaugurating a\r\nrevolution between the States thereof, each and every individual is\r\nalready released from his obligations to that government; yet, as best\r\ncomports with the dignity of the subject, and also from due regard to\r\nthose who may hold a different opinion――and further still, that all\r\nthe world may be advised of our action,――I respectfully recommend that\r\nour connections with the Federal Union be formally annulled in such\r\nmanner as shall involve the highest exercise of the sovereign\r\nauthority of the people of the State and best secure that harmony, so\r\nmuch to be desired, in times like the present, in questions of detail.\r\nThe speediest method of accomplishing this will be the perfecting of\r\nan ordinance by the Legislature formally declaring the independence of\r\nthe State of Tennessee of the Federal Union, renouncing its authority,\r\nand resuming each and every function belonging to a separate\r\nsovereignty; and said ordinance when perfected should be submitted to\r\na vote of the people to be by them adopted or rejected. Under existing\r\ncircumstances I can see no propriety in encumbering the people of the\r\nState with the election of delegates, to do that which is in our power\r\nto enable them to do directly for themselves. The most direct as well\r\nas the highest act of sovereignty, according to our theory, is that by\r\nwhich the people vote, not merely for men, but for measures submitted\r\nfor their approval or rejection. Since it is only the voice of the\r\npeople that is to be heard, there is no reason why they may not as\r\nreadily and effectively express themselves upon an ordinance framed\r\nand submitted to them by the Legislature as if submitted by a\r\nconvention.“\r\n\r\nThe Legislature was as eager as before to execute the will of the\r\nGovernor. It embodied his recommendations in an act passed May 6,\r\n1861.[5] This act contained two important provisions. The first was:\r\n\r\n     “Declaration of Independence and Ordinance dissolving the\r\n     federal relations between the State of Tennessee and the\r\n     United States of America.\r\n\r\n     “We the people of the State of Tennessee, waiving any\r\n     expression of opinion as to the abstract doctrine of\r\n     secession, but asserting the right, as a free and\r\n     independent people, to alter, reform, or abolish our form of\r\n     government in such manner as we think proper, do ordain and\r\n     declare, that all the laws and ordinances by which the State\r\n     of Tennessee became a member of the Federal Union of the\r\n     United States of America are hereby abrogated and annulled,\r\n     and that all obligation on our part be withdrawn therefrom;\r\n     and we do hereby resume all the rights, functions, and\r\n     powers which by any of said laws and ordinances were\r\n     conveyed to the Government of the United States, and absolve\r\n     ourselves from all obligations, restraints, duties, incurred\r\n     thereto; and do hereby henceforth become a free, sovereign,\r\n     and independent State.“\r\n\r\nThis ordinance was to be submitted to a direct vote of the people. Two\r\nsets of tickets were to be prepared; one set marked Separation, the\r\nother Non-Separation. Those favoring the ordinance were to vote the\r\nformer ticket, those opposed, the latter. The act of May 6th further\r\nprovided for the submission at the same election of the question as to\r\nwhether Tennessee, if it severed its relations with the Union, should\r\njoin the Confederacy. This question was also embodied in the form of\r\nan Ordinance.\r\n\r\nBut the Governor and the Legislature did not wait for the popular\r\nverdict upon these Ordinances. As early as May 7th, they extended an\r\ninvitation to the Confederacy to select Nashville as its capital city.\r\nA few days later a still more extraordinary step was taken. Governor\r\nHarris, acting under a joint resolution of the Legislature, appointed\r\nthree commissioners to negotiate a military league with the\r\nConfederate authorities. These commissioners, representing the State\r\nof Tennessee, and Mr. Henry W. Hilliard, an agent of the Confederacy,\r\ndrew up the following agreement:\r\n\r\n     “Convention between the State of Tennessee and Confederate\r\n     States of America.[6]\r\n\r\n     “The State of Tennessee, looking to a speedy admission into\r\n     the Confederacy established by the Confederate States of\r\n     America, in accordance with the Constitution for the\r\n     Provisional Government of said States, enters into the\r\n     following temporary Convention, Agreement, and Military\r\n     League with the Confederate States, for the purpose of\r\n     meeting pressing exigencies affecting common rights,\r\n     interests, and safety of said State and said Confederacy.\r\n\r\n     “First. Until the said State shall become a member of said\r\n     Confederacy, according to the constitutions of both powers,\r\n     the whole military force and military operations, offensive\r\n     and defensive, of said State in the impending conflict with\r\n     the United States, shall be under the chief control and\r\n     direction of the President of the Confederate States, upon\r\n     the same basis, principle, and footing as if said State were\r\n     now during the interval a member of said Confederacy, said\r\n     force, together with that of the Confederate States, to be\r\n     employed in common defence.\r\n\r\n     “Secondly. The State of Tennessee will, upon becoming a\r\n     member of said Confederacy under the permanent Constitution\r\n     of said Confederate States, if the same shall ever occur,\r\n     turn over to the Confederate States all the public property\r\n     acquired from the United States on the same terms as the\r\n     other States of said Confederacy have done in like case.”\r\n\r\nThis agreement was laid before the Legislature in a special message,\r\nand almost unanimously ratified. Its provisions were promptly\r\nexecuted. The vote of the people upon the Declaration of Independence\r\nand the Ordinance adopting the Provisional Constitution of the\r\nConfederacy did not occur till the eighth of June. The result of the\r\nvote, as shown by the official returns, was as follows:\r\n\r\n    ------------------+---------------+-----------------\r\n                      |  Separation.  |  No Separation.\r\n    ------------------+---------------+-----------------\r\n    East Tennessee    |     14,780    |      32,923\r\n    Middle Tennessee  |     58,265    |       7,956\r\n    West Tennessee    |     29,127    |       6,117\r\n    Camps             |      6,246    |\r\n                      +---------------+-----------------\r\n        Total         |    108,418    |      46,996\r\n    ------------------+---------------+-----------------\r\n\r\n    ------------------+-----------------+-------------------\r\n                      | Representation. | No Representation.\r\n    ------------------+-----------------+-------------------\r\n    East Tennessee    |     14,061      |      32,962\r\n    Middle Tennessee  |     58,198      |       8,298\r\n    West Tennessee    |     28,912      |       6,104\r\n    Camps             |      6,340      |\r\n                      +-----------------+-------------------\r\n        Total         |    107,511      |      47,364\r\n    ------------------+-----------------+-------------------\r\n\r\nImmediately after the election, Gov. Harris issued a proclamation\r\nannouncing Tennessee’s withdrawal from the Union. This was followed by\r\nthe proclamation of Jefferson Davis, officially declaring that\r\nTennessee had become a member of the Confederacy. On the first of\r\nAugust the State adopted the permanent Confederate Constitution by\r\nvote of 83,133 for, 30,357 against.\r\n\r\nNothing now remained to complete Tennessee’s absorption into the\r\nConfederacy but the election of representatives to the Confederate\r\nCongress. In October, the Legislature selected Langdon C. Haynes and\r\nGustavus Henry as Confederate Senators. Haynes was a distinguished\r\nDemocrat of East Tennessee, while Henry was a Whig. Representatives to\r\nthe Lower House were chosen by a vote of the people. Here again the\r\nWhigs and Democrats were equally represented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     [1] Cox: _Three Decades of Federal Legislation_.\r\n\r\n     [2] Acts of Tennessee, Extra Session, 1861, pp. 1 to 13.\r\n\r\n     [3] Acts of Tennessee, Extra Session, 1861, p. 14.\r\n\r\n     [4] Acts of Tennessee, 2d Extra Session, 1861, pp. 1 to 11.\r\n\r\n     [5] Acts of Tennessee, 2d Extra Session, 1861, p. 13.\r\n\r\n     [6] Acts of Tennessee, 2d Extra Session, 1861, p. 19.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nRESPONSIBILITY FOR SEPARATION\r\n\r\n\r\nJust as radical differences of opinion have existed as to the parties\r\nresponsible for the whole secession movement, so the action of\r\nTennessee has been variously interpreted. A number of writers have\r\ncontended that the majority of her citizens were never in favor of\r\nsecession, and it was only a _coup d’état_ of Governor Harris that\r\ncarried the State into the Confederacy. This view is a survival of the\r\nopinion once so widely prevalent in the North that the Civil War was\r\nthe result of a conspiracy of a few ambitious Southern politicians,\r\nwho tricked the mass of the Southern people into a war which never had\r\ntheir genuine approval.\r\n\r\nIt must be confessed that at first view the mode of Tennessee’s\r\nwithdrawal gives some countenance to this theory. In February, 1861,\r\nshe had placed her disapproval upon secession by voting down a\r\nproposition to call a convention. Instead of yielding to this mandate\r\nof the people, Governor Harris and the Legislature had entered into a\r\nmilitary league with the Confederate authorities, and having thus\r\nsurrendered the real control of the State, they again went through the\r\nform of appealing to a plebiscite for approval of their action.\r\nNevertheless, we are confident that an unprejudiced examination of\r\nthese events will show that Tennessee, with the exception of the\r\neastern part of the State, joined the Confederacy as willingly as\r\nSouth Carolina or Mississippi.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, these writers have made the mistake of classing\r\nTennessee among the border States. Mr. Wilson in his _History of the\r\nSlave Power_ says: “Exactly why Tennessee should have been taken out\r\nof the Union, while Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri were prevented\r\nfrom going, no man is wise enough to say. At least, none but general\r\nreasons can be given. Exactly why the conspirators were foiled in one\r\ncase and not in the other, exactly by whom the current of treason was\r\nchecked and turned in the one and not in the other, the wisest can\r\nonly conjecture.”\r\n\r\nThe answer to the problem which Mr. Wilson found so difficult to solve\r\nlies in the fact that conditions in Tennessee were in no wise similar\r\nto those in Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri. These border States were\r\nnot distinctly slave States. In all of them the institution of slavery\r\nexisted, but their industrial system was not based upon it. This arose\r\nlargely from the fact that cotton was not their chief staple.\r\nTennessee, on the other hand, was a great cotton-producing State.\r\nAccording to the census of 1860, her annual product was 296,465 bales\r\nof 400 lbs. each. Her interest was therefore identical with the\r\nextreme Southern States. If there were to be two republics side by\r\nside, one free and the other slave, both sentiment and interest\r\napparently demanded that Tennessee should cast her lot with the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\nWhen the vote of February was taken she was confronted by no such\r\ndilemma. At that time, the Confederacy had not yet been organized, and\r\nit was by no means clear that war would occur. In June, conditions had\r\nentirely changed. The Confederacy was an established fact, and actual\r\nhostilities had commenced. Neither side would permit Tennessee to\r\noccupy a neutral position. She must fight either for or against the\r\nSouth.\r\n\r\nThis change in the issues is clearly shown in the two messages of\r\nGovernor Harris. In his message of January 7th, he had sought to\r\nestablish the right of secession, and justify its present or immediate\r\nassertion. But these principles had found no support in the Whig\r\nparty. Their opposition defeated the proposal for a convention. The\r\nkeynote to his second message is found in the following passage:\r\n“Whatever differences may have heretofore existed amongst us growing\r\nout of party divisions, as to the constitutional right of secession as\r\na remedy against usurpations, all admit the moral right asserted by\r\nour fathers to resist wrong and to maintain their liberties by\r\nwhatever means necessary.” This was a direct appeal to the right of\r\nrevolution, and it found as ready a response among the Whigs as the\r\nDemocrats. It was therefore this change in the issue, and not coercive\r\nmeans adopted by Governor Harris, that turned the tide toward\r\ndisunion.\r\n\r\nThe recognized leader of the Whig party was John Bell. Throughout his\r\nlong career in the service of the national government, he had\r\nconsistently opposed the doctrine of secession. In the presidential\r\nelection of 1860, he, even more than Mr. Lincoln, was the Union\r\ncandidate. When the question of holding a convention was submitted to\r\na vote of the people, he vigorously opposed it. In this opposition he\r\nwas joined by Neil S. Brown, Cave Johnson, Ewing, and other\r\ndistinguished Whig politicians. It was due to their efforts that the\r\nConvention proposal was defeated. The vote against the Convention was\r\n91,803. This represented the entire Whig party, and the Democrats of\r\nEast Tennessee. The votes cast for the Convention came almost wholly\r\nfrom the Democrats of Middle and West Tennessee. In short, the\r\nelection of February was a division along party lines. Its result was\r\nsimply an indication that the Whig party of Tennessee was still\r\nopposed to the doctrine of secession.\r\n\r\nIn June, party lines had been obliterated. For only a few weeks\r\nelapsed after the defeat of the Convention, till a majority of the\r\nWhig leaders, either in public addresses or through the public press,\r\ncounselled withdrawal from the Union. The contest now became\r\nsectional; it was East Tennessee against Middle Tennessee and West\r\nTennessee. Governor Harris, in his negotiations with the Confederate\r\nauthorities, was counselled and supported by both Whigs and Democrats.\r\nAlthough the unfavorable verdict of the people upon secession had not\r\nbeen formally reversed, he was conscious that a real change had taken\r\nplace in their sentiments, and that he was, in fact, executing their\r\nwill by concluding a military league with the Confederacy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nLOYALTY OF EAST TENNESSEE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile we have attempted to show the untenable position of those who\r\nmaintain that the majority of the people of Tennessee were opposed to\r\nseparation and it was only a _coup d’état_ of Governor Harris that\r\ncarried the State into the Confederacy, it is, however, true that a\r\ngreat number of her inhabitants did resist withdrawal and remain\r\nopenly loyal. This was especially the case with East Tennessee. Her\r\npersistent loyalty is a striking illustration of the physical\r\nconditions and causes which lay behind the Civil War. Tennessee had\r\nbeen settled by a common stock of pioneers from North Carolina. Many\r\nof these, attracted by the beautiful scenery and genial climate, had\r\nfound homes east of the Cumberland Mountains, while others had crossed\r\nthe mountains and taken possession of the rich tablelands and the\r\nalluvial bottoms of Middle and West Tennessee. When the State was\r\nadmitted into the Union, in 1796, her population was homogeneous. The\r\ninstitution of slavery existed in all sections of the State.\r\n\r\nIn West and Middle Tennessee, where the soil and climate were suitable\r\nfor raising cotton, slave labor was very profitable. In East\r\nTennessee, the poor upland farms scarcely yielded a return to white\r\nlabor. As the result of this difference in natural conditions, slavery\r\nflourished in West and Middle Tennessee, but in East Tennessee, by\r\n1860, it had become almost extinct, except upon the rich plantations\r\nthat bordered the Tennessee River. The efforts to form a Confederacy\r\nbased upon slavery found, therefore, no support among the inhabitants\r\nof East Tennessee. Their interests and sympathy were with the free\r\nStates of the North, and they rejected by a vote of two to one every\r\nproposal looking toward separation.\r\n\r\nIn the eyes of the nation, Andrew Johnson stood as the representative\r\nof East Tennessee loyalty. Upon the floor of the United States Senate\r\nhe denounced the withdrawal of the Southern members as treason, and\r\nrefused to vacate his own seat even after Tennessee had been\r\nproclaimed by Jefferson Davis a part of the Confederacy.\r\n\r\nNext to Johnson, the most prominent Union man was W. G. Brownlow, the\r\neditor of the _Knoxville Whig_. Mr. Brownlow is in many respects the\r\nmost unique figure in the history of Tennessee. He commenced life as a\r\ncarpenter’s apprentice, but after serving his apprenticeship he\r\nentered the Methodist ministry and travelled as a circuit rider for\r\nten years without intermission. His love of controversy led him into\r\nmost of the political and religious discussions of the day, and gained\r\nfor him the name of the “Fighting Parson.” About 1835 he became the\r\neditor and publisher of a Whig newspaper, which rapidly gained a\r\nlarger circulation than any other political paper in the State.\r\n\r\nIn the presidential election of 1860 Mr. Brownlow supported Bell and\r\nEverett. After the election his voice was on the side of peaceful\r\nacquiescence in the results. In vigorous editorials he denounced the\r\nsentiments expressed in the message of Governor Harris to the extra\r\nsession of the Legislature. After the passage of the Convention Bill\r\nhe joined several prominent citizens in issuing a call for an “East\r\nTennessee Convention.” Every county in East Tennessee except two\r\nresponded to the call. The Convention assembled at Knoxville, on the\r\n13th of May, 1861. The delegates present numbered four hundred and\r\nsixty-nine, and represented twenty-eight counties. Hon. Thos. A. R.\r\nNelson was elected chairman. On motion, he appointed a committee to\r\nprepare and report business for the Convention.\r\n\r\nThis committee drew up an address to the people, which was in part as\r\nfollows:[7]\r\n\r\n     “Our country is at this moment in a most deplorable\r\n     condition. The Constitution of the United States has been\r\n     openly contravened and set at defiance, while that of our\r\n     own State has shared no better fate, and by the sworn\r\n     representatives of the people has been utterly disregarded.\r\n     In this calamitous state of affairs, when the liberties of\r\n     the people are so imperilled and their most valued rights\r\n     endangered, it behooves them, in their primary meetings and\r\n     in all their other accustomed modes, to assemble, consult\r\n     calmly as to their safety, and with firmness to give\r\n     expressions to their opinions and convictions of right.\r\n\r\n     “We, therefore, the delegates here assembled, representing\r\n     and reflecting, as we verily believe, the opinions and\r\n     wishes of a large majority of the people of East Tennessee,\r\n     do resolve and declare:\r\n\r\n     “That the evils which now afflict our beloved country, in\r\n     our opinion, are the legitimate offspring of the ruinous and\r\n     heretical doctrine of secession; and that the people of East\r\n     Tennessee have ever been, and we believe still are, opposed\r\n     to it by a very large majority. That while the country is\r\n     now upon the very threshold of a most ruinous and desolating\r\n     Civil War, it may with truth be said, and we protest before\r\n     God, that the people, so far as we can see, have done\r\n     nothing to produce it. That the people of Tennessee, when\r\n     the question was submitted to them in February last, decided\r\n     by an overwhelming majority that the relations of the State\r\n     towards the Federal Government should not be changed;\r\n     thereby expressing their preference for the Union and the\r\n     Constitution under which they had lived prosperously and\r\n     happily, and ignoring in the most emphatic manner the idea\r\n     that they had been oppressed by the General Government in\r\n     any of its acts, legislative, executive, or judicial.\r\n\r\n     “That in view of a so decided expression of the will of the\r\n     people, in whom all power is inherent and on whose authority\r\n     all free governments are founded, and in the honest\r\n     conviction that nothing has transpired since that time which\r\n     should change that deliberate judgment of the people, we\r\n     have contemplated with peculiar emotions the pertinacity\r\n     with which those in authority have labored to over-ride the\r\n     judgment of the people and to bring about the very result\r\n     which the people themselves had so overwhelmingly condemned.\r\n\r\n     “That the Legislative Assembly is but the creature of the\r\n     Constitution of the State, and has no power to enact any\r\n     laws or to perform any act of sovereignty, except such as\r\n     may be authorized by that instrument: and believing, as we\r\n     do, that in their recent legislation, the General Assembly\r\n     have disregarded the rights of the people and transcended\r\n     their own legitimate powers, we feel constrained, and we\r\n     invoke the people throughout the State, as they value their\r\n     liberties, to visit that hasty, unconsiderate, and\r\n     unconstitutional legislation with a decided rebuke, by\r\n     voting on the eighth day of next month against both the Act\r\n     of Secession and that of Union with the Confederate States.\r\n\r\n     “That the Legislature of the State, without having first\r\n     obtained the consent of the people, had no authority to\r\n     enter a ‘Military League’ with the ‘Confederate States’\r\n     against the General Government, and by so doing to put the\r\n     State of Tennessee in hostile array against the Government\r\n     of which it then was and still is a member. Such legislation\r\n     is in advance of the expressed will of the people to change\r\n     their governmental relations, was an act of usurpation, and\r\n     should be visited with the severest condemnation of the\r\n     people.”\r\n\r\nThis report was unanimously adopted by the Convention and ordered to\r\nbe printed, so that it might be circulated among the voters of the\r\nState. Before the Convention adjourned it was addressed by Andrew\r\nJohnson. According to a contemporary report, “he spoke for three hours\r\nand commanded earnest attention throughout his entire speech.”\r\n\r\nIn the election of June 8th, the vote of East Tennessee stood: 14,780,\r\nseparation; 39,923, no separation; 14,601, representation; 32,962, no\r\nrepresentation.\r\n\r\nNine days after the election, a second Convention of Union men\r\nassembled at Greenville. Two hundred and ninety-nine delegates were\r\npresent. Many of them were in favor of forming at once a Provisional\r\nGovernment and organizing an army, but after a heated discussion more\r\nmoderate counsel prevailed. A Declaration of Grievances was drawn up\r\nby the same committee that had prepared the address to the people\r\nadopted by the Knoxville Convention. A new committee was appointed to\r\nprepare and present a memorial to the State Legislature, asking its\r\nconsent to the formation of a new State to be composed of East\r\nTennessee and such counties in Middle Tennessee as desired to\r\ncoöperate to that end. But before this committee had an opportunity to\r\npresent the memorial to the Legislature the Confederate Government had\r\nput it beyond the power of Tennessee to act in the matter by\r\norganizing East Tennessee into a military department, and placing\r\nGeneral Zolicoffer in supreme command. His presence in Knoxville with\r\nseveral regiments of soldiers prevented any further steps towards the\r\nformation of a new State hostile to the Confederacy.\r\n\r\nThere was at first no disposition on the part of the Confederate\r\nauthorities to deal harshly with the loyal inhabitants of East\r\nTennessee, or to coerce them into the Confederate army. They were\r\nallowed to remain undisturbed in their ordinary occupations. The\r\ngeneral leniency with which they were treated is shown by the fact\r\nthat Mr. Brownlow was allowed to continue the publication of the\r\n_Knoxville Whig_, although every issue contained editorials denouncing\r\nthe action of Governor Harris and the Legislature as treason and\r\nrebellion. This peaceful policy was rudely disturbed by an act of the\r\nUnion men themselves. On the night of the eighth of November, an\r\norganized conspiracy was partially carried out by the bands of Union\r\nmen, to burn the bridges of the East Tennessee, Virginia, and Georgia\r\nRailway. The bridges over the Hiwassee River, Lick Creek, and three\r\nother streams were destroyed. That one over the Holston River at\r\nStrawberry Plains was saved by the bravery of the watchmen.\r\n\r\nThis attempt at bridge-burning created the utmost alarm and\r\nexcitement. The East Tennessee, Virginia, and Georgia Railway was the\r\nmain artery which connected Richmond with the southwest. Thousand of\r\ntroops were being hurried over it daily in order to reach Richmond in\r\ntime to defend it from McClellan’s advances. The road traversed the\r\nwhole eastern part of the State, and on account of its extent could\r\nnot be properly patrolled. Extraordinary measures must thereupon be\r\nresorted to, in order to keep open this important line of\r\ncommunication, and protect the lives of the soldiers from the terrible\r\ndisaster which would have resulted from the secret destruction of the\r\nbridges.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of November, the Confederate Secretary of War, Mr.\r\nBenjamin, sent the following orders to Colonel Wood, who was in\r\ncommand of the troops at Knoxville:\r\n\r\n     “All such as can be identified in having been engaged in\r\n     bridge-burning are to be tried summarily by drum-head\r\n     court-martial, and if found guilty, executed on the spot by\r\n     hanging. It would be well to leave their bodies hanging in\r\n     the vicinity of the burned bridges.”\r\n\r\nThis order was vigorously executed. A number of persons suspected of\r\ncomplicity in the bridge-burning were seized, and after a summary\r\ntrial were executed in the manner suggested by the Secretary of War.\r\nMartial law was proclaimed, and the meetings of Union men forcibly\r\ndispersed.\r\n\r\nAs a result of these measures there now began a general exodus of the\r\nable-bodied Union men. In small bands they crossed over the mountains\r\ninto Kentucky. Many of them joined the Federal army, and rendered\r\nvaluable service. Others formed camps safely within the Union lines,\r\nand quietly awaited the termination of the war. Their most prominent\r\nleaders made tours of the Northern cities, and raised funds for their\r\nsupport. Boston alone contributed over one hundred thousand dollars to\r\nthis purpose.[8] Vast crowds listened to the eloquent appeals of these\r\nexiled loyalists, and the impression became general in the North that\r\nthe Southern authorities were treating the loyal mountaineers of East\r\nTennessee with the most savage cruelty. Edward Everett, in a brilliant\r\noration, compared them with followers of William Tell and the\r\nslaughtered saints of Piedmont.\r\n\r\nThe sacrifices and sufferings of the loyal inhabitants of East\r\nTennessee were indeed very great, but there is no evidence that they\r\nwere treated by the Confederacy in any manner not necessary and\r\njustified by the usages of war. After the failure of its conciliatory\r\npolicy, the Confederacy either had to permit the erection of a hostile\r\nState within the heart of its territory, or coerce the loyalists into\r\nsubmission. It naturally adopted the latter alternative. It is\r\nfrequently stated that in thus adopting coercive methods it acted\r\ninconsistently with the principles under which it withdrew from the\r\nUnion. Mr. Everett, in the same speech quoted above, said: “One would\r\nsuppose that under the usurped rule of men who profess to go to war\r\nfor self-government and State rights, the people of East Tennessee, if\r\nfor any reason they saw fit to do so, had a right to burn their own\r\nbridges.”\r\n\r\nThe absurdity of such statements lies in the fact that they confuse\r\nthe denial of coercive powers to federal government, with the denial\r\nof coercive powers to all government. The first is State rights, but\r\nthe second is anarchy. It was in perfect harmony with the Southern\r\ntheory of State sovereignty, that Tennessee should use any means it\r\nsaw fit, to force its citizens into obedience to its laws. The\r\nConfederate army acted as the agent of the State in quelling\r\ninsurrection and rebellion in East Tennessee.\r\n\r\nAfter the intense excitement created by the bridge-burning had\r\nsomewhat subsided, the Confederate and State authorities again\r\nmanifested a desire to win over, or at least conciliate, the Union\r\nelement. The commander at Knoxville issued a proclamation to the\r\n“Disaffected People of East Tennessee,” and assured “all those\r\ninterested who have fled to the enemy’s lines, and who are actually in\r\ntheir army, that he will welcome their return to their homes and their\r\nfriends; they are offered amnesty and protection, if they come to lay\r\ndown their arms, and act as loyal citizens.” But these conciliatory\r\nmeasures again met with failure, as it soon became necessary to\r\nenforce the military drafts, which aroused the greatest opposition. In\r\nthe summer of 1863, East Tennessee became the theatre of active war.\r\nIts history for the next three years is to be found in the military\r\nannals of the State.\r\n\r\n\r\n     [7] Hume’s, _Loyal Mountaineers of Tennessee_.\r\n\r\n     [8] See Everett’s “Account of the Fund for the Relief of\r\n         East Tennessee.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE RESTORATION OF CIVIL GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Tennessee escaped both executive and congressional\r\nreconstruction, it did not follow in the restoration of its civil\r\ngovernment the plan laid down by President Lincoln. The most\r\ndistinctive feature of Lincoln’s reconstruction policy lay in the fact\r\nthat it made the old political people in each of the Southern States\r\nself-acting nuclei, which were to bring order out of chaos. According\r\nto this theory, neither the President nor Congress had the power to\r\nreconstruct a State government. The people within a State alone had\r\nthe right to initiate and carry into effect measures for the\r\nrehabilitation of the deranged governmental machinery. It was the duty\r\nof the President under Article IV, Section 4, of the Constitution, to\r\nsee that their efforts in this direction did not prove abortive by\r\nreason of domestic violence.\r\n\r\nThe germs of this policy may be seen in the instructions sent to the\r\nmilitary governors. It was more fully developed in the amnesty\r\nproclamation of Dec. 8, 1863. By the terms of this proclamation, a\r\ngeneral pardon was granted to all “who directly or by implication had\r\nparticipated in the rebellion, with certain exceptions specified, upon\r\ntheir taking an oath to henceforth support the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States, and abide by the proclamations of the President and the\r\nacts of Congress in relation to slavery.” It was further promised,\r\n“that whenever a number of persons in any of the rebel States, equal\r\nto not less than one tenth of the votes cast in such State in the\r\npresidential election of the year 1860, each having taken the oath\r\naforesaid, and not having violated it, and being a qualified voter by\r\nthe election law of the State existing immediately before the\r\nso-called act of secession, and excluding all others, shall establish\r\na State government which shall be republican in form, and in nowise\r\ncontravening said oath, such shall be recognized as the true\r\ngovernment of the State.”\r\n\r\nThis was, substantially, Lincoln’s plan for reconstruction. It was not\r\ncarried out in any of the Southern States. In all, except Tennessee,\r\nit was succeeded by executive reconstruction under Johnson, which was\r\nin turn supplanted by congressional reconstruction. In Tennessee an\r\nentirely original plan was adopted. This plan shut out from\r\nparticipation in the work of organizing civil government, all those\r\nwho had taken part in secession. An oath of past loyalty was made the\r\ntest of political capacity. In short, the restored civil government in\r\nTennessee was based solely on that portion of its inhabitants that had\r\nremained loyal to the Union. These Union men, or Radicals as they\r\nchose to call themselves, composed about one third of the population\r\nof the State, and represented about one fifth of the taxpayers. It\r\nwill be the object of this chapter to trace the steps by which this\r\nsmall minority seized the reins of government and exercised for three\r\nyears absolute control of the State.\r\n\r\nAfter the fall of Fort Donelson, on February 15, 1862, the greater\r\npart of Tennessee soon came into the possession of the Union army,\r\npresident Lincoln immediately appointed Andrew Johnson military\r\ngovernor. Athough vested with almost unlimited powers, Governor\r\nJohnson had at first little opportunity for their exercise, as the\r\nUnion army did not remain in peaceful possession of the State. Along\r\nthe southern border raged the bloody battles of Shiloh, Chickamauga,\r\nand Missionary Ridge.\r\n\r\nBy the fall of 1863, the tide of battle had rolled so far southward\r\nthat the soil of Tennessee was at last free from contending armies.\r\nThe time had now arrived for the restoration of civil government. But\r\nGovernor Johnson felt secure in the exercise of his power only so long\r\nas it rested upon a military basis. He therefore seemed in no hurry to\r\nreorganize the State government. He contented himself with filling the\r\nvacant offices, most of which under the laws were elective, by the\r\nappointment of his political friends thereto.\r\n\r\nThe leaders of the Union men in the State, the majority of whom were\r\nnever in sympathy with Johnson, began to grow restive under his\r\nmilitary dictatorship.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1864, occurred Johnson’s nomination for the Vice-Presidency.\r\nHe naturally desired to obtain the electoral vote of his own State. A\r\nConvention was therefore called to meet in Nashville for the purpose\r\nof nominating an electoral ticket. The Union leaders seized the\r\nopportunity which the Convention presented for perfecting an\r\norganization of the Union party. A committee was appointed by the\r\nConvention, and empowered to issue a call for a second Convention.\r\n\r\nThe second Convention was called to meet in Nashville, Dec. 19, 1864.\r\nIt failed to convene on the day appointed, as Nashville was at that\r\ntime threatened by Hood’s army. The defeat of the Confederate forces\r\nin the battle of Nashville removed the danger, and the Convention came\r\ntogether on the third day of January, 1865.\r\n\r\nThe work of the Convention was summed up in the passage of one\r\nresolution.[9] The first section contained this statement of the\r\nauthority under which it claimed to act: “Whereas the first article\r\nand the first section of the Declaration of Rights in the Constitution\r\nof the State of Tennessee declares, ‘That all power is inherent in the\r\npeople, and all free governments are founded on their authority, and\r\ninstituted for their peace, safety, and happiness; and that for the\r\nadvancement of these ends they have at all times an inalienable and\r\nindefeasable right to alter, reform, or amend the governments as they\r\nmay think proper,’ We, the people of Tennessee, in Convention\r\nassembled, do propose the following alterations and amendments to the\r\nConstitution, which, when ratified by the sovereign loyal people shall\r\nbe and constitute a permanent part of the Constitution of Tennessee.“\r\nThis assertion of constituent powers by the Convention was purely a\r\nrevolutionary act. The Constitution could be legally changed only in\r\nthe manner prescribed by the Constitution itself. In the third section\r\nof the eleventh article, it provided that all amendments must\r\noriginate with the State Legislature. In no sense could the Convention\r\nbe held to represent the Legislature. It was therefore in the eyes of\r\nthe law a body of private citizens.\r\n\r\nThe second section of the resolution passed by the Convention\r\ncontained the proposed amendments. The most important were: the\r\nabolition of slavery, the declaration of the invalidity of the\r\nsecession acts, and an article giving the Legislature the power to\r\ndetermine the suffrage. It was further provided that these amendments\r\nshould be submitted to a vote of the people, and if ratified by the\r\nmajority of those voting, the military governor was ordered to hold an\r\nelection for Governor and Legislature. All voters should be required\r\nto take the following oath: “I solemnly swear that I will henceforth\r\nsupport the Constitution of the United States, and defend it against\r\nthe assaults of all its enemies; that I am an active friend of the\r\ngovernment of the United States, and the enemy of the so-called\r\nConfederate States; that I ardently desire the suppression of the\r\npresent rebellion against the United States; that I rejoice in the\r\ntriumph of the armies and navies of the United States, and in the\r\ndefeat of the armies, navies, and all other armed combinations of the\r\nso-called Confederate States; that I will cordially oppose all\r\narmistices or negotiations for peace with rebels in arms until the\r\nConstitution of the United States and all laws and proclamations made\r\nin pursuance thereof, shall be established over all the people of\r\nevery State and territory embraced within the national Union; and that\r\nI will heartily aid and assist the loyal people in whatever measures\r\nmay be adopted for the attainment of these ends; and further, that I\r\ntake this oath freely and voluntarily and without mental reservation,\r\nso help me God.”\r\n\r\nThis test oath marks the first grave departure from President\r\nLincoln’s plan. He had suggested a simple oath “to henceforth” support\r\nthe Constitution on the principle, as he expressed in his message to\r\nCongress, that “that test is a sufficient one which accepts as sound\r\nwhoever will make a sworn recantation of his former unsoundness.” This\r\ntest oath, framed by the Convention, went much further and virtually\r\ndisfranchised all who had served in the Confederate army.\r\n\r\nThe Convention completed its labors by nominating a candidate for\r\nGovernor, and a general ticket for the Legislature. It thus combined\r\nthe functions of a political and constitutional convention.\r\n\r\nGovernor Johnson now had no motive for delaying the reorganization of\r\nthe State government, as it was only a month until his inauguration as\r\nVice-President. He thereupon gave force to the action of the\r\nConvention by a proclamation ordering a vote of the people to be taken\r\nin the mode prescribed by the Convention. The election was held on\r\nFebruary 22d, and resulted in 25,293 for, 48 against. On February\r\n25th, Johnson issued a second proclamation declaring the amendment\r\nratified, and ordering an election for Governor and Legislature. The\r\nsecond election occurred on the 4th of March. W. G. Brownlow, the\r\ncandidate for Governor, received 23,352 votes against 35 scattering.\r\nThe legislative candidates received the same number of votes as the\r\nelection was by general ticket.\r\n\r\nIn the presidential election of 1860 the vote of the State was\r\n145,000. Johnson therefore held that Tennessee had fulfilled the 10\r\nper cent. requirement of Lincoln’s amnesty proclamation. He issued a\r\nfinal proclamation in which he attempted to set the stamp of legality\r\nupon the newly elected Governor and Legislature.\r\n\r\nThe energies of the new State government were immediately directed\r\ntoward securing the continued ascendancy of the Union party. This was\r\nat first an easy matter, as one of the new amendments to the\r\nConstitution had given the Legislature the power of determining the\r\nsuffrage qualifications.\r\n\r\nThe Legislature convened on the 2d of April. On the 7th Brownlow was\r\ninaugurated. His message contained the following brief reference to\r\nthe all-important question of the franchise: “While I would not\r\nrecommend you to give way to the impulse of vengeance any more than to\r\nthe appeals of sympathy and pity, I would urge you to guard the\r\nballot-box faithfully and effectually against the approach of treason,\r\nno matter in what character it may come.”[10]\r\n\r\nMost of the Union leaders in the Legislature desired the absolute\r\ndisfranchisement of the “rebels,” but it was feared so extreme a\r\nmeasure would arouse hostility in Congress to seating the\r\nRepresentatives from Tennessee. A compromise bill, known as the Arnell\r\nBill,[11] was finally passed. By its provisions the right to vote was\r\nrestricted to the following persons: “White men over twenty-one years\r\nold, who were publicly known to have entertained unconditional Union\r\nsentiment from the outbreak of the Rebellion, or who arrived at age\r\nsince March 4, 1866, and who had not been engaged in armed rebellion\r\nagainst the United States Government, also those who had served in the\r\nFederal army, and been honorably discharged, those who had been\r\nconscripted by force in the Confederate army, and were known to be\r\nUnion men, and all those who had voted at the election in March and\r\nFebruary, 1865.” All other persons were disfranchised. For all persons\r\nwho had held civil or diplomatic office under the Confederate\r\nGovernment, or who had held military offices above the ranks of\r\ncaptain in the Confederate army, or lieutenant in the Confederate\r\nnavy, also for those who had resigned from the Congress of the United\r\nStates, or the army or navy of the United States, the term of\r\ndisfranchisement was for fifteen years. For all other persons from\r\nwhom the suffrage was withheld the disfranchisement was to last only\r\nfour years.\r\n\r\nThe first election to occur after the passage of the Arnell Franchise\r\nLaw, was the congressional election of August 3, 1865. All the\r\ncandidates were Union men, but one set represented the conservative\r\nelement which opposed disfranchisement and tests oaths. The Radicals\r\nfelt perfectly confident of defeating the Conservatives, if the\r\nprovisions of the new law were carried out. But it soon became evident\r\nthat the Radicals had much to fear both from open violation of the\r\nlaw, and secret intimidation of the voter. Governor Brownlow, on the\r\n10th of July, issued a proclamation declaring “that all who had banded\r\ntogether to defeat the franchise law would be dealt with as rebels.”\r\n\r\nThe election passed off without violence. On the 10th of August,\r\nbefore all the returns were in, Governor Brownlow requested the clerks\r\nand sheriffs to give him information as to illegal voting. On the\r\ninformation thus received, he cast out the vote of twenty-five\r\ncounties. Notwithstanding this action of the Governor, four of the\r\nConservatives were elected.\r\n\r\nThe August election demonstrated to the Union party the necessity of\r\nenacting a more efficient machinery for executing the election laws.\r\nOn January 19, 1866, a new franchise bill was introduced in the\r\nLegislature.[12] It made the disfranchisement of the ex-Confederates\r\nperpetual. It also established the office of the Commissioner of\r\nRegistration in each county, and required that certificates of\r\nregistration issued by these commissioners should be presented by\r\nevery voter in all elections, municipal, county, and State. The power\r\nof appointing and removing these commissioners was given to the\r\nGovernor. He was also authorized to cast out any registration he\r\nconsidered illegal. This made him absolute judge of elections. The\r\nbill was passed May 3, 1866. It was amended in November so as to give\r\nthe suffrage to the negro. The ascendancy of the Union party in\r\nTennessee was now secured, so far as State statute could accomplish\r\nthis result.\r\n\r\n\r\n      [9] Laws of Tennessee, 1865, Introductory Documents, p. 3.\r\n\r\n     [10] Laws of Tennessee, 1865, 1-15.\r\n\r\n     [11] _Ibid._, p. 32.\r\n\r\n     [12] Acts of Tennessee, 1866-67, p. 26.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nRECOGNITION BY CONGRESS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Radical leaders in Tennessee naturally expected that the\r\nreadmission of the Representatives to their seats in Congress would\r\nimmediately follow the restoration of the State government. Therefore,\r\nupon the assembling of the first session of the Thirty-ninth Congress,\r\nthe full delegation from Tennessee was present on the floor, ready to\r\nanswer to their names. When Mr. Edward McPherson, the clerk of the\r\nHouse, omitted the name of Tennessee along with the other Southern\r\nStates from the preliminary roll-call, Mr. Horace Maynard created a\r\ndramatic scene by waving aloft his certificate of election, and\r\ndemanding recognition. In the discussion which followed the roll-call,\r\nthe cause of Mr. Maynard was championed by Mr. Brooks, the leader of\r\nthe Democratic minority. “If Mr. Maynard,” he said, “is not a loyal\r\nman, and is not from a State in this Union, what man, then, is loyal?\r\nIn the darkest and most doubtful period of the war, when an exile from\r\nhis own State, I heard his eloquent voice on the banks of the St.\r\nLawrence rousing the people of my State to discharge their duties to\r\ntheir country.” The action of Mr. McPherson was upheld by a vote of\r\nthe House.\r\n\r\nThis refusal to seat the Tennessee Representatives arose, partly on\r\naccount of the failure to distinguish between the loyal government in\r\nTennessee, and the so-called Johnson governments, but chiefly because\r\nthe Republican leaders wished to delay action until a complete\r\nreconstruction policy could be mapped out. The Representatives\r\ncontinued, however, to press the claims of the State for recognition\r\nbefore the “Joint Committee of Fifteen,” to which was referred all\r\nmeasures affecting the status of the Southern States.\r\n\r\nThis Committee was just on the point of yielding, when the veto of the\r\nFreedman Bureau Bill occurred. The day after the veto, Mr. Stevens\r\nbrought before the House, from the Committee of Fifteen, a “concurrent\r\nresolution concerning the insurrectionary States,” as follows: “Be it\r\nresolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), that\r\nin order to close agitation upon a question which seems likely to\r\ndisturb the action of the Government, as well as to quiet the\r\nuncertainty which is agitating the minds of the people of the eleven\r\nStates which have been declared to be in insurrection, no Senator or\r\nRepresentative shall be admitted to either branch of Congress, from\r\nany of the said States until Congress shall have declared such State\r\nentitled to such representation.” A strong effort was made to exempt\r\nTennessee from the provisions of the Resolution. Mr. Grider, a member\r\nof the Committee of Fifteen, offered, to that effect, a minority\r\nreport as follows: “The minority of the Committee on Reconstruction,\r\non the part of the House, beg leave to report that said committee have\r\ncaused an inquiry to be made as to the condition and loyalty of\r\nTennessee. There has been a large amount of evidence taken, a part of\r\nit conducing to show that at some localities occasionally there have\r\nbeen some irregularities and disaffection, yet the main direction and\r\nweight of the testimony are ample and conclusive to show that a great\r\nbody of the people in said State are not only loyal and willing, but\r\nanxious to have and maintain amicable, sincere, and patriotic\r\nrelations with the General Government. Such being the state of facts,\r\nwe offer the following resolution, to wit:\r\n\r\n     “_Resolved_, That the State of Tennessee is entitled to\r\n     representation in the Thirty-ninth Congress, and the\r\n     representatives elected from and by said State are hereby\r\n     admitted to take their seats therein upon being qualified by\r\n     oath according to law.”\r\n\r\nIn speaking in opposition to this minority resolution, Mr. Stevens\r\nsaid: “I think I may say without impropriety, that until yesterday\r\nthere was an investigation into the condition of Tennessee, to see\r\nwhether by act of Congress we could admit that State to a condition of\r\nrepresentation here, and admit its members to seats here, but since\r\nyesterday there has arisen a state of things which the committee deem\r\nputs it out of their power to proceed further without surrendering a\r\ngreat principle, without the loss of all their dignity, without\r\nsurrendering the rights of this body to the usurpation of another\r\npower.” The “Concurrent Resolution,” introduced by Mr. Stevens, was\r\ncarried without amendment, so the readmission of Tennessee was again\r\npostponed indefinitely.\r\n\r\nTwo months later, however, its readmission was foreshadowed in a\r\nspeech by Mr. Bingham on the Fourteenth Amendment. “I trust,” he said,\r\n“that this amendment will pass this House, that the day will soon come\r\nwhen Tennessee――loyal Tennessee――loyal in the very heart of the\r\nrebellion, her mountains and plains blasted by the very ravagers of\r\nwar and stained with blood of her faithful children fallen in the\r\ngreat struggle for the maintenance of the Union, having already\r\nconformed her constitution and laws to every provision of this\r\namendment, will at once, upon its submission by Congress, irrevocably\r\nratify it, and be, without further delay, represented in Congress by\r\nher loyal Representatives and Senators. Let that great example be set\r\nby Tennessee, and it will be worth a hundred thousand votes to the\r\nloyal people in the free North.”\r\n\r\nThe suggestion contained in this speech was promptly acted upon by the\r\nRadical government in Tennessee. On the 19th of June, the Fourteenth\r\nAmendment was ratified by the Legislature. Mr. Brownlow immediately\r\nsent the following telegram to Washington:\r\n\r\n                           “NASHVILLE, TENN., Thursday, July 18.\r\n     To HON. E. M. STANTON, _Sec. of War_,\r\n               Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\n     “My compliments to the President. We have carried the\r\n     Constitutional Amendment in the House. Vote 43 to 18; two of\r\n     his tools refusing to vote.\r\n\r\n                                               “W. G. BROWNLOW.”\r\n\r\nOn the same day the news of this ratification was received, Mr.\r\nBingham introduced into the House the following resolution:\r\n\r\n     “Joint resolution declaring Tennessee again entitled to\r\n     Senators and Representatives in Congress.\r\n\r\n     “_Whereas_, The State of Tennessee has in good faith\r\n     ratified the article of amendment to the Constitution of the\r\n     United States proposed by the Thirty-ninth Congress to the\r\n     Legislatures of the several States, and has also shown, to\r\n     the satisfaction of Congress, by the proper spirti of\r\n     obedience in the body of her people, her return to her due\r\n     allegiance to the Government, laws, and authority of the\r\n     United States; therefore,\r\n\r\n     Be it resolved by the Senate and the House of\r\n     Representatives of the United States of America in Congress\r\n     assembled, That the State of Tennessee is hereby restored to\r\n     her former proper practical relation in the Union, and again\r\n     entitled to be represented by Senators and Representatives\r\n     in Congress, duly elected and qualified, upon their taking\r\n     the oaths of office required by existing laws.“\r\n\r\nIn urging the immediate adoption of the resolution, Mr. Bingham\r\ndeclared that: “Inasmuch as Tennessee has conformed to all our\r\nrequirements; inasmuch as she has, by a majority of her whole\r\nLegislature in each House, ratified the amendment in good faith;\r\ninasmuch as she has of her own voluntary will conformed her\r\nconstitution and laws to the Constitution and Laws of the United\r\nStates; inasmuch as she has by her fundamental law forever prohibited\r\nthe assumption or payment of the rebel debt, or the enslavement of\r\nmen; inasmuch as she has by her own constitution declared that rebels\r\nshall not exercise any of the political power of the State or vote at\r\nelections; and thereby giving the American people assurance of her\r\ndetermination to stand by this great measure of security for the\r\nfuture of the Republic, Tennessee is as much entitled to be\r\nrepresented here as any other State of the Union.”\r\n\r\nThe resolution was opposed by a few members on the ground that\r\nTennessee had not, as yet, conferred the suffrage upon the negro. Mr.\r\nBoutwell offered an amendment providing that Tennessee should not be\r\nreadmitted until it had established an “equal and just system of\r\nsuffrage.”\r\n\r\nOn June 20th the resolution passed the House, one hundred and\r\ntwenty-five voting in the affirmative, and twelve in the negative. On\r\nthe succeeding day, it came up for consideration in the Senate. Mr.\r\nTrumbull proposed, in the place of the preamble which had been framed\r\nby Mr. Bingham and passed by the House, the following substitute:\r\n\r\n     “_Whereas_, In the year 1861, the government of the State of\r\n     Tennessee was seized upon and taken possession of by persons\r\n     in hostility to the United States, and the inhabitants of\r\n     said State in pursuance of an act of Congress were declared\r\n     to be in a state of insurrection against the United States,\r\n     and whereas said State government can be restored to its\r\n     former political relations in the Union only by the consent\r\n     of the law-making power of the United States; and whereas\r\n     the people of said State did on the 22d of February, 1865,\r\n     by a large and popular vote adopt and ratify a constitution\r\n     of government whereby slavery was abolished, and all\r\n     ordinances and laws of secession and debts contracted under\r\n     the same were declared void; and whereas a State government\r\n     has been organized under said Constitution, which has\r\n     ratified the amendment to the Constitution of the United\r\n     States abolishing slavery, also the amendment proposed by\r\n     the Thirty-ninth Congress, and has done other acts\r\n     proclaiming and denoting loyalty; Therefore, etc.”\r\n\r\nMr. Sherman opposed the substitution of this preamble on the ground\r\nthat it would probably cause the President to veto the resolution.\r\n“These political dogmas,” he said, “cannot receive the sanction of the\r\nPresident, and to insert them will only create delay, and postpone the\r\nadmission of Tennessee.”\r\n\r\nAfter a considerable discussion, the question being taken on the\r\npassage of the preamble as substituted by the Senate, together with\r\nthe resolution of the House, resulted in twenty-eight votes in the\r\naffirmative, and four in the negative. The House promptly agreed to\r\nthe amendment of the Senate, and the joint resolution was sent to the\r\nPresident for his approval.\r\n\r\nThe President approved the joint resolution, but sent a message to the\r\nHouse which was in the nature of a protest against the opinions\r\nexpressed in the preamble. After giving at length his objections to\r\nthe preamble, the President said:\r\n\r\n     “Earnestly desiring to remove every cause of further delay,\r\n     whether real or imaginary, on the part of Congress to the\r\n     admission to their seats of loyal Senators and\r\n     Representatives from the State of Tennessee, I have,\r\n     notwithstanding the anomalous character of this proceeding,\r\n     affixed my signature to the resolution. My approval,\r\n     however, is not to be construed as an acknowledgment of the\r\n     right of Congress to pass laws, preliminary to the admission\r\n     of duly qualified representatives from any of the States.\r\n     Neither is it to be construed as committing me to all the\r\n     statements made in the preamble, some of which are, in my\r\n     opinion, without foundation in fact, especially the\r\n     assertion that the State of Tennessee has ratified the\r\n     amendment to the Constitution of the United States proposed\r\n     by the Thirty-ninth Congress. No official notice of such\r\n     ratification has been received by the Executive, or filed in\r\n     the Department of State; on the contrary, unofficial\r\n     information from most reliable sources, induces the belief\r\n     that the amendment has not yet been constitutionally\r\n     sanctioned by the Legislature of Tennessee. The right of\r\n     each House, under the Constitution, to judge of the\r\n     elections, returns, and qualifications of its own members is\r\n     undoubted, and my approval or disapproval of the resolution\r\n     could not in the slightest degree increase or diminish the\r\n     authority in this respect conferred upon the two branches of\r\n     Congress.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTENNESSEE AND THE NEW AMENDMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe deed of cession of Tennessee to the United States by North\r\nCarolina contained the provision “that no regulation made or to be\r\nmade by Congress shall tend to emancipate slaves.” The constitution\r\nunder which Tennessee was admitted into the Union also recognized\r\nslavery by the use of the term “freeman” throughout the bill of\r\nrights. It was, however, exceedingly liberal in regard to the\r\nsuffrage, conferring it upon every “freeman of the age of twenty-one\r\nyears, and upwards.” Under this provision, free negroes were allowed\r\nto vote.\r\n\r\nAbout 1830, there developed a strong movement in favor of\r\nemancipation. At Jonesborough was established the first abolition\r\nnewspaper ever published in America. But this emancipation sentiment\r\nhad entirely disappeared by 1860. Even in East Tennessee, the most\r\nextreme opponents of secession were firm believers in slavery.\r\n\r\nThe Emancipation Proclamation of January 1, 1863, did not include\r\nTennessee within its provisions. Slavery, therefore continued to exist\r\nas a legal institution until abolished by an amendment to the State\r\nconstitution. This amendment, as we have seen, was framed by the\r\nRadical Convention of 1865. In April, of the same year, Gov. Brownlow\r\nlaid before the Legislature a joint resolution of Congress containing\r\nthe proposed Thirteenth Amendment. It was promptly ratified.\r\n\r\nIn his initial message, Gov. Brownlow discussed, at considerable\r\nlength, the race problem. He sought to impress upon the Legislature,\r\n“that some legislation was necessary for the protection, government,\r\nand control of the emancipated slave.” The Legislature did not enter\r\nupon this work immediately. It was not till May 11, 1866, that a bill\r\nwas passed entitled, “An act to define the term, ‘A Person of Color,’\r\nand to declare the rights of such persons.”\r\n\r\nThe first section of this act provided that under the term “Person of\r\nColor” should be included all “negroes, mulatoes, meztigsoes, and\r\ntheir descendants having African blood.” The second section declared:\r\n“That persons of color have the right to make and enforce contracts,\r\nto sue and be sued, to be parties and give evidence, and have full and\r\nequal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of person\r\nand estate, and shall not be subject to any other or different\r\npunishment, pains, or penalty for the commission of any act or offence\r\nthan such as are prescribed for white persons committing like acts or\r\noffences.” By the fifth section, slave marriages were legalized. The\r\nlast section declared that nothing in the act should be so construed\r\nas to admit persons of color to serve on the jury, or to require the\r\neducation of colored and white children in the same school.\r\n\r\nSoon after the passage of this act occurred the great struggle over\r\nthe ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment. At the time of its\r\nsubmission by Congress to the State the Legislature was not in\r\nsession. Gov. Brownlow, therefore, issued a call for an extra session\r\nto convene on July 4th. The members were very slow in assembling. It\r\nbecame apparent that the opponents of the amendment in the Lower House\r\nwould seek to defeat its ratification by preventing a quorum, which\r\nwas fixed by the constitution at two thirds of all the members. Upon\r\nthe first roll-call only forty-two members answered to their names. At\r\nthe third meeting this list was increased to fifty-four, but it still\r\nfell short two votes of the necessary two thirds. The Sergeant-at-arms\r\nwas, therefore, instructed to arrest the absentees, and bring them by\r\nforce to the floor of the House. He did not find this an easy task, as\r\nthe refractory members sought by every means possible to elude his\r\nsearch.\r\n\r\nThe following extract from his report gives a glimpse of the ludicrous\r\ngame of hide-and-seek enacted in different parts of the State:\r\n\r\n     “I have the honor to report that in compliance with\r\n     instruction that I should proceed to Hamilton County, and\r\n     arrest George B. Foster, member of the House of\r\n     Representatives, I proceeded to Chattanooga on Friday the\r\n     13th, 1866, arriving on the morning of the fourteenth, at 2\r\n     o’clock; communicated with the Sergeant of the Metropolitan\r\n     Police, procured a wagon, and, in company with Sergeant\r\n     Bently, proceeded to the summit of Lookout Mountain, to the\r\n     residence of Mr. Foster, and was there informed by his\r\n     family that he had ridden out in the country; carefully\r\n     watched the premises without result until evening; was\r\n     informed that he would be home that night; lay up on the\r\n     mountain all night, awaiting his return. Mr. Foster did not\r\n     return. I am satisfied that his family on the mountain, at\r\n     the time of my leaving them, did not positively know of his\r\n     whereabouts, although there was a manifest intention on\r\n     their part to mislead as to his locality. I found it\r\n     impossible to conceal my business, and destination,――the\r\n     resolution of the House and order for the arrest of the\r\n     absentees having been published and otherwise\r\n     communicated.”[13]\r\n\r\nSeveral of the members attempted to resign, but Governor Brownlow\r\nrefused to accept their resignations. He sent the following response\r\nto Mr. Dunnaway, representative from Bedford County: “Sir,――As it is\r\nevident the design of your resignation is to reduce the House below a\r\nquorum and to break up the Legislature, the same is not accepted.”\r\n\r\nExasperated at the repeated failure of the Sergeant-at-arms to arrest\r\nthe hiding members, Governor Brownlow, on the 14th of July, applied to\r\nGeneral Thomas for military assistance. This request was referred to\r\nthe Secretary of War, Mr. Stanton, who replied: “That the duty of the\r\nUnited States forces is not to interfere in any way in the\r\ncontroversies between the political authorities of the State, and Gen.\r\nThomas will strictly refrain from any interference between them.”\r\n\r\nThe deadlock was finally broken on the 19th of July, in a somewhat\r\nextraordinary manner. Two members, arrested by the Sergeant-at-arms,\r\nwere brought to the Capitol, and placed in a committee-room\r\ncommunicating with the hall of the House. A motion was then passed\r\nthat they “be invited and required to take their seats within the bar\r\nof the House.” The two members refused to come out of the committee\r\nand continued to remain silent when their names were called. The\r\nSpeaker thereupon declared that no quorum was present. An appeal was\r\ntaken from this ruling, and it was reversed. The House then proceeded\r\nto a vote upon the amendment; and it was declared duly ratified,\r\nforty-three votes having been cast in the affirmative, and eleven in\r\nthe negative.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Mr. Williams, one of the arrested members, applied\r\nfor and obtained a writ of habeas corpus. It was made returnable to\r\nThomas N. Frazier, Judge of the Criminal Court of Davidson County,\r\nwho, upon the hearing of the case, discharged Mr. Williams from the\r\ncustody of the Sergeant-at-arms. On account of this decision, the\r\nHouse of Representatives preferred articles of impeachment against\r\nJudge Frazier. He was tried by the Senate, sitting as a Court of\r\nImpeachment. It sustained the articles of impeachment, and deposed\r\nJudge Frazier from office. He was also forever disqualified from\r\nholding any office of profit or trust in the State. His\r\ndisqualifications were however removed by the Constitutional\r\nConvention of 1870, and he was afterward re-elected Criminal Judge.\r\n\r\nThe Fifteenth Amendment was submitted to Tennessee in 1869, just\r\nbefore the close of the radical era. The suffrage had been conferred\r\nupon the negro by an act of the Legislature of the previous year, but\r\nit was known that the whole question would be reopened by the\r\nConstitutional Convention which had just been called. The Legislature,\r\ntherefore, refused to take final action on the amendment. It was\r\nreferred to the Committee on Federal Relations, from which it was\r\nnever reported.\r\n\r\n\r\n     [13] Acts of Tennessee, Extra Session, 1866.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nFINANCIAL ADMINISTRATION OF THE RADICAL GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe joint resolution of July 24, 1866, completed, so far as Congress\r\nwas concerned, the restoration of civil government in Tennessee. Her\r\nSenators and Representatives were admitted to their seats, and the\r\nState, to all intents and purposes, was restored to the same position\r\nit had occupied prior to the attempted withdrawal in 1861.\r\n\r\nThe political basis of the restored government was, as we have pointed\r\nout, the loyal people of the State. They consisted mainly of four\r\nelements, namely, the inhabitants of the small towns and the upland\r\nfarms of East Tennessee, and poor whites, or “white trash,” as they\r\nwere commonly called, scattered throughout the State, a few “old-line”\r\nWhigs in West and Middle Tennessee, and lastly the negro and the\r\ncarpetbagger. This ruling minority was, therefore, neither an\r\naristocracy of wealth, intelligence, nor social position. It could not\r\nbe expected that the management of public affairs by such hands would\r\nbe just and conservative. From the beginning it showed a tendency\r\ntoward reckless expenditures and an entire disregard of property\r\nrights. Mr. Brownlow, in his first message to the Legislature, advised\r\na general increase in the salaries of State officials. This advice\r\ncame at a time when the finances were at a low ebb, and the whole\r\nindustrial and agricultural interests of the community were thoroughly\r\ndemoralized. Nevertheless, the Legislature was only too ready to carry\r\nthese suggestions of Governor Brownlow into execution. They passed a\r\nbill increasing the salaries of the supreme judges from $2000 to $5000\r\na year. This was followed by other bills increasing the salaries of\r\nthe various State officials. This resulted in an enormous increase in\r\nthe current expenditures of the State.\r\n\r\nThe whole expenses of the State government for the years 1851 to 1861,\r\ninclusive, had been about $6,500,000. The entire expenses during the\r\nBrownlow administration, which lasted only three years and a half,\r\nwere $7,301,352. The taxes in 1868 were fourfold greater than in 1861,\r\nyet on the former date, the Comptroller announced in his report to the\r\nLegislature that the State was on the verge of bankruptcy.\r\n\r\nBut the most troublesome legacy Mr. Brownlow left the people of\r\nTennessee was an increase in the State debt of $21,647,000.\r\n\r\nBy an Act of the Legislature in 1852, known as the General Internal\r\nImprovement Law, the Governor had been empowered to issue State bonds\r\nto the amount of $8000 per mile in aid of railroad companies, upon the\r\nfollowing conditions: “1. That the company shall first secure bonafide\r\nsubscriptions to its capital stock to an amount sufficient to grade,\r\nbridge, and prepare for the inner rails the whole extent of the main\r\ntrunk line proposed to be constructed; 2. That it be shown by the\r\ncompany to the Governor that the said subscriptions are good and\r\nsolvent; 3. That the company shall have graded, bridged, and made\r\nready to put down the necessary timbers, for the reception of rails,\r\nand fully completed a specified number of miles at either terminus in\r\na good and substantial manner, with good material for putting the iron\r\nrails and equipments in place, and that the State shall be given a\r\nfirst-mortgage lien on their property; 4. That the Governor shall be\r\nnotified of these facts by the written affidavits of the Chief\r\nEngineers and President of the Company, together with the written\r\naffidavit of a competent engineer appointed by the Governor to examine\r\nthe specified section; and shall be furnished with an affidavit of the\r\nPresident of the Company, and a resolution of a majority of its Board\r\nof Directors for the time being, pledging that the bonds issued to it\r\nshall not be used for any other purpose than that of procuring the\r\niron rails, chairs, spikes, and equipments, and for putting down the\r\niron rails on the specified section for which they are issued; and\r\nthat the President shall deposit in the office of the Secretary of\r\nState a full and accurate list of all the stockholders, with the sum\r\nsubscribed by each and every stockholder.”\r\n\r\nUnder the provisions of this act, there had been issued, prior to the\r\nwar, bonds amounting to $14,841,000. In the main, the conditions\r\nenumerated in the act, were fairly complied with, and the State\r\nprotected from all loss.\r\n\r\nThe close of the war left the railroads, like every other industrial\r\ninterest in the State, in a thoroughly demoralized condition. Upon the\r\nfirst arrival of the Federal troops, they had been seized by the\r\nGovernment and used for military purposes. A great part of the rolling\r\nstock had been destroyed, and many of the bridges and buildings burnt.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the restored government was in working order, the railroad\r\ninterests turned to the State treasury for relief. This was obtained\r\nthrough the passage of a number of bills, which professed to be based\r\nupon the Act of 1852. They were known as Omnibus bills, and under\r\ntheir provisions bonds to the amount of $14,393,000 were issued.\r\n\r\nThe means resorted to to secure the passage of the Omnibus bills\r\nfurnished the greatest scandals of the restoration period. They are\r\nvividly set forth in the following extract from the Report of the\r\nCommittee of Investigation appointed by the Legislature of 1879:\r\n\r\n     “Many corporate presidents, agents, and representatives came\r\n     to Nashville to attend the sittings of the Legislature. All\r\n     known influences were used upon the supposed representatives\r\n     of the people. From the pulpit to the bagnio, recruits were\r\n     gathered for the assault on the treasury of the State. Fine\r\n     brandy by the barrel was on hand to fire thirst and muddle\r\n     the brain, and first-class suits of clothing to capture the\r\n     vanity or avarice of the gay or needy. Money, the proceeds\r\n     of the bonds issued by the State, for specific purpose to\r\n     these men, was here in abundance, and it was used. Take one\r\n     example: A man came to the State. He was appointed Receiver\r\n     of two short insolvent railroads at a salary of $5000. He\r\n     was appointed Commissioner of Registration for Franklin\r\n     County. He sent his Superintendent to the Legislature of\r\n     1867 as a member. That member, in conjunction with a certain\r\n     Senator, was active in procuring ‘State aid.’ The\r\n     Commissioner and Receiver let out contracts on his road, and\r\n     was a silent member. The proof shows that this Receiver,\r\n     this member, and this Senator formed a conspiracy to defraud\r\n     the State. About a million dollars of bonds issued under the\r\n     Act of 1867 went into the hands of the Receiver. Take\r\n     another: A president of a railroad would sell bonds and\r\n     apply a portion of the proceeds in corrupt efforts to get\r\n     more bonds. They got bonds for roads that had never been\r\n     surveyed and located. One railroad president says that he\r\n     had great influence with the Governor, that another railroad\r\n     president wanted bonds and desired his services with said\r\n     Governor, that he got them, that, in addition to pay\r\n     directly for his services and influences with the Governor,\r\n     he was to have control of a portion of the bonds obtained to\r\n     use as margin in stock speculations in New York. They got\r\n     885 bonds in New York. This man of influence with the\r\n     Governor further says that he and the other president were\r\n     partners in stock speculation, and used the bonds obtained\r\n     from the State in these speculations.”\r\n\r\nWhen the Democrats regained control of the State, the settlement of\r\nthe State debt, which had been so greatly increased by the Brownlow\r\nAdministration, proved a most perplexing question. It became an apple\r\nof political discord, and retarded the industrial and commercial\r\nregeneration of the State. It disrupted the Democratic party into\r\nthree factions. A few of the most prominent leaders desired to see the\r\nState’s credit preserved by paying the bonds in full. A still larger\r\nnumber, while recognizing the validity of the bonds, conscientiously\r\nbelieved that the State, on account of the amount of the debt, and the\r\ndemoralized business conditions resulting from the war, would be\r\nunable to meet its just obligations. They therefore favored some\r\nagreement with the bondholders, whereby the debt could be scaled\r\nwithout inflicting dishonor upon the State. A third faction was for\r\nopen repudiation. They contended that the bonds were illegal on two\r\ngrounds, first, they had been issued in direct violation of the\r\nconditions precedent laid down in the Internal Improvement Act of\r\n1852, and its amendments; secondly, the Brownlow Administration, which\r\nhad issued the bonds, did not represent the State, it was a mere\r\ninterim of usurpation and revolutionary government. While for purposes\r\nof convenience its acts, which affected merely private rights, should\r\nnot be disturbed, nevertheless it could not pledge the credit of the\r\nState.\r\n\r\nIn 1873 a Funding Act was passed by the Legislature. It provided that\r\nall past due coupons and bonds might be funded into new bonds bearing\r\ninterest at six per cent., redeemable after July 1, 1884, and payable\r\nJuly 1, 1914. Coupons on the new bonds were payable on January and\r\nJuly of each year, beginning with July, 1874. The question as to the\r\nvalidity of the Brownlow bonds was avoided by inserting a provision\r\nthat only “bonds legally issued should be funded.” But the State\r\nofficials ignored this provision by funding all the bonds that were\r\npresented.\r\n\r\nThis Funding Act of 1873 proved a failure. The State was unable to\r\nmeet its interest on the new bonds. A series of bad crops increased\r\nthe difficulty. The assessment returns for 1874, as compared with\r\nthose of 1873, exhibited a decrease of $18,556,173.\r\n\r\nOn January 1, 1877, the arrears of interest amounted to $1,570,646. It\r\nnow became apparent to the bondholders that they must either effect\r\nsome compromise with the State, or run the risk of losing the entire\r\ndebt. They, therefore, entered into personal communications with the\r\nGovernor, and signified to him their willingness to compromise. Their\r\ncommunications were laid before the Legislature, and it adopted on\r\nJanuary 26, 1877, the following resolution:\r\n\r\n     “_Whereas_, The General Assembly has with pleasure received,\r\n     through the message of his Excellency the Governor, the\r\n     communications of certain gentlemen, holders of bonds of the\r\n     State, and representatives of holders of bonds, asking for a\r\n     conference looking to a permanent and equitable adjustment\r\n     and compromise of the claims held by them against the State;\r\n     therefore, be it\r\n\r\n     “_Resolved_, By the General Assembly, that the Governor be\r\n     requested to communicate by telegram, or by letter, with the\r\n     gentlemen holding securities of the State, mentioned in his\r\n     message, and request them to submit, on the earliest day\r\n     possible, through him, to the General Assembly any\r\n     proposition of adjustment and compromise, which they may\r\n     desire.”\r\n\r\nAs the result of this resolution, a committee of the Legislature and a\r\ncommittee of the bondholders met and agreed to the following\r\nproposition: “That arrearages of interest to July 1, 1877, be added to\r\nthe bonds, and that new ones for sixty per cent. of the total amount\r\nbe issued, made to bear interest at six per cent., and to fall due in\r\nthirty years.” It was naturally expected that the Legislature would\r\nratify the action of its committee. Much to the surprise of every one\r\nconcerned, it not only rejected the proposition, but decreased the tax\r\nrate from forty to ten cents per hundred dollars, and thus made the\r\npayment of interest absolutely impossible.\r\n\r\nLater in the year the bondholders presented a second proposition, in\r\nwhich they agreed to a scaling of the debt fifty per cent., but this\r\nwas also rejected by the Legislature.\r\n\r\nIn 1879 a committee was appointed by both Houses of the Legislature to\r\ninvestigate and report upon the State debt. This committee, after\r\ntaking a great amount of evidence, presented an elaborate report.\r\nActing upon this report the Legislature passed a second bill, March\r\n31st. It provided for the issue of bonds bearing four per cent.\r\ninterest to be exchanged for outstanding bonds with the interest\r\naccrued thereon, at the rate of fifty per cent. on the dollar. It was\r\nnot to become a law until approved by a vote of the people, and two\r\nthirds of the bondholders. The consent of the bondholders was readily\r\nobtained, but the measure was defeated at the polls.\r\n\r\nA settlement of the debt now seemed hopeless. It was the chief issue\r\nin the gubernatorial campaign of 1880. The divisions of the Democratic\r\nparty resulted in the election of the Republican candidate, Alvin\r\nHawkins. The newly elected Legislature was also favorable to the\r\nbondholders. A bill was passed which provided for the funding of the\r\noutstanding debt at par, the new bonds to bear interest at three per\r\ncent., and the coupons to be receivable for taxes. The bill was signed\r\nby the Governor, and went into effect in April. It was regarded\r\nas a great triumph for the bondholders, but their rejoicing\r\nwas short-lived. In a test case the courts decided the law\r\nunconstitutional, on the ground that the Legislature could not make a\r\nvalid contract in which the coupons should be receivable for taxes for\r\nninety-nine years. This decision reopened the whole question.\r\n\r\nThe defeat which the Democrats had suffered in 1880 served to unite\r\nthem in 1882. Their candidate, W. B. Bate, was elected Governor. In\r\nhis message to the Legislature, Governor Bate marked out a plan for\r\nthe settlement of the debt which was finally adopted, by an act passed\r\nMarch 15, 1883. This act declares: “That the State will pay in full\r\nthe bonds held by Mrs. James K. Polk, and all bonds held by\r\neducational, literary, and charitable institutions in the State; that\r\nit will pay in discharge of its just obligations, what is known as the\r\nState debt proper in full, less war interest; and that in compromise\r\nof the remainder of the debt, known as the railroad debt, it will pay\r\none half of the principal and accrued interest by issuing therefor\r\nbonds of the State bearing interest at the rate of three per cent. per\r\nannum.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nRADICAL MUNICIPAL ADMINISTRATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe “carnival of crime and corruption” described in the preceding\r\nchapter was not confined to the Legislature. Similar scenes were\r\nenacted in almost every county and city in the State. As the suffrage\r\nlimitations placed upon the ex-Confederates applied to all elections,\r\nthe Radicals were in complete control of these local governments. The\r\nlarge municipalities, such as Memphis, Nashville, Chattanooga, and\r\nKnoxville were the greatest sufferers from the rule of irresponsible\r\nand corrupt officials.\r\n\r\nIn 1867, a carpetbagger, by the name of Alden, had succeeded in being\r\nelected Mayor of Nashville. Having filled the city council with his\r\npolitical followers, most of whom were non-property-holders, he\r\nentered upon a course of open and systematic public plunder, which\r\nmade even the State administration stand aghast. The city treasury was\r\nsoon drained. The tax rate was enormously increased; but as this did\r\nnot suffice, checks, warrants, and due bills, made out in the name of\r\nthe city, and payable to bearer, were sold to street shavers of notes\r\nat any price they could bring. Bonds were also issued. As these\r\nevidences of indebtedness multiplied, the market quotations for them\r\ndeclined.\r\n\r\nIn the face of this wholesale corruption, Alden and his associates\r\nwere re-elected. It now became evident that, unless some heroic\r\nmeasure was resorted to, the entire property of the city would be\r\nconfiscated by their rapacity. A tax-payers association was formed,\r\nwhich began a campaign of public agitation. Public meetings were held\r\nin various parts of the city, and resolutions were adopted denouncing\r\nthe “Alden ring” in the most scathing terms.\r\n\r\nIt was finally decided to seek relief through the courts. All the\r\njudges throughout the State were Radical, but in striking contrast\r\nwith all the other officials of the Radical régime, they were men of\r\nunquestioned integrity, and, for the most part, lawyers of high\r\nstanding. They had displayed great independence in interpreting the\r\nfranchise laws, and in curtailing, as far as possible, the excessive\r\nuse of the military power. Mr. Thornburg, the defeated candidate for\r\nmayor, filed a bill in the Chancery Court of Davidson County, in which\r\nhe alleged that the city administration was inefficient, that its\r\nmembers were guilty of fraud and corruption, and that of right their\r\noffices were vacant because they were not owners of real estate, as\r\nrequired by law. He therefore prayed that the city officials be\r\nenjoined from the further issuance of checks and notes, and that they\r\nbe declared usurpers and turned out of office, and that a receiver be\r\nappointed to take charge of the affairs of the corporation. Pending\r\nthe coming in of the answer of the defendants, and the final decision\r\nof the case, Chancellor Shackelford granted a temporary injunction\r\nrestraining the mayor and the city council from receiving any salary\r\nor perquisites of office. On December 7th, final decision was\r\nrendered, the Chancellor using the following language: “I am of the\r\nopinion that the complainants are not entitled to the injunction or\r\nthe receiver prayed for, and the application is therefore refused.”\r\n\r\nIn May, 1869, Col. A. S. Colyar, editor of the _Union and American_,\r\nand one of the most distinguished lawyers in the South, made a\r\nthorough examination of the city’s books and records. At a\r\nmass-meeting of the citizens, he made the most startling disclosure in\r\nregard to the extravagance and corruption uncovered by that\r\ninvestigation. He declared that the city was in the hands of thieves,\r\nand expressed the opinion that there was not a judge on the bench of\r\nTennessee who would refuse to grant relief. On June 1st, he filed a\r\nbill at Gallatin, Tenn., before Charles Smith, Chancellor of the\r\nSeventh Chancery Division.\r\n\r\nThe bill was brought “in the name of the State in the relation of 466\r\ncitizens in behalf of themselves and others against the mayor, and the\r\ncity council, the city treasurer, revenue collector, and others.” It\r\nprayed “that further speculation in checks be enjoined; that no more\r\nchecks be issued and no more received until, on the one hand, the\r\nright of the city to issue them should be accurately defined, and\r\nuntil, on the other, the validity of outstanding checks should be\r\ndetermined; that the corporation officers who were defendants in the\r\ncase, be compelled to account for money made by speculation in the\r\nmeans and credit of the city; and lastly, that a receiver of known\r\nfinancial ability, with good credit and good reputation, be appointed\r\nwith full power to control the finances of the city and make contracts\r\nso as to save the city from ruin.”\r\n\r\nThe terrible condition of the city was set forth at length in the\r\nbill. It was alleged, among other things, that $1,323,668 in checks\r\nhad been issued, $759,000 of which were without authority of law,\r\nwhile much of the remainder was for illegal purposes. The most\r\nexorbitant rates of interest were paid, in some cases as much as 100%.\r\nFailing to meet its maturing obligations, the creditors of the city\r\nwere resorting to the courts, and the city’s property was being sold\r\nto satisfy them.\r\n\r\nAfter an elaborate argument of the case, in which the defendants were\r\nrepresented by eminent lawyers, Chancellor Smith granted the prayer of\r\nthe petitioners. Mr. John M. Bass was appointed receiver. After\r\nfurnishing a bond of $500,000, he entered upon the receivership, June\r\n28th. On the following month, a motion was made by the deposed\r\nofficials, in the Nashville Chancery Division, to have the\r\nreceivership dissolved. The motion came up for hearing before Judge\r\nEdwin H. East, the successor of Chancellor Shackelford. Judge East had\r\nbeen the private secretary of President Johnson, and had taken a\r\nleading part in the reorganization of the State.\r\n\r\nIn arguing against the motion to dissolve, Col. Colyar took the ground\r\nthat a municipal corporation was not a political body, but simply a\r\nbusiness corporation whose officers were amenable to the courts for\r\nthe proper discharge of their functions. Judge East concurred in this\r\nview, and upheld the receivership. In his opinion, he used the\r\nfollowing language: “The functions of a municipality are twofold:\r\nfirst, political, discretionary, legislative; secondly, ministerial.\r\nWhile acting within the sphere of the former, they are exempt from\r\nliability inasmuch as the corporation is a part of the government, to\r\nthat extent, and its officers are to the same extent public officers,\r\nand as such entitled to the protection of this principle; but within\r\nthe sphere of the latter (ministerial duties), they drop the badge of\r\ngovernmental officers, and become, as it were, the representatives of\r\na private corporation in the exercise of private functions. The\r\ndistinction between these legislative powers which it holds for public\r\npurposes as a part of the government of the country, and those public\r\nfranchises which belong to it as creation of law, is well taken.”\r\n\r\nThe receivership was of short duration. In August the regular city\r\nelection occurred. Mr. Morris, a wealthy citizen, was elected mayor.\r\nImmediately after the election, the affairs of the city were again\r\nplaced in the hands of its ordinary officials.\r\n\r\nSeveral years after the occurrence of these extraordinary proceedings,\r\nCol. Colyar, in a speech delivered at Buffalo, N. Y., explained the\r\nlegal theory on which he placed the application for the receivership.\r\n“I took the ground,” he said, “that, while in England, cities were in\r\na sense political, because in the creation of the House of Commons,\r\nthe cities and boroughs had in part organized it, in the time of\r\nEdward I., and to this day, as cities and boroughs, they elect members\r\nto the House of Commons; but that in this country, our cities have no\r\nsuch political status, and that in nowise are they separate from the\r\nbalance of the community in politics, and therefore our cities are not\r\npolitical bodies, and that the delegation of a part of a State’s\r\nsovereignty is a fiction, and the management of a city is a mere\r\ntrust.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nKU-KLUX OUTRAGES\r\n\r\n\r\nIt does not fall within the limits of our subject to go into the\r\ngeneral history of Ku-Klux Klan. This mysterious organization\r\noriginated in Tennessee, but it soon spread beyond the borders of the\r\nState, and became the organ of all those who believed in resorting to\r\nviolent measures to secure the emancipation of the Southern States\r\nfrom negro and carpetbag domination. Its history, therefore, belongs\r\nunder the general history of Reconstruction. Nevertheless, the study\r\nof the civil disturbances in Tennessee resulting from the war would\r\nindeed be incomplete without some account of the operation of the\r\nKu-Klux within the borders of the State. It formed the chief occasion\r\nfor interferences with civil liberty, as well as for congressional\r\nlegislation, which rendered the Radical government so hateful in the\r\neyes of the ex-Confederates.\r\n\r\nThe first official reference to disturbances of an extraordinary\r\ncharacter is found in Governor Brownlow’s first message to the\r\nLegislature. In this, he calls the attention of the Legislature to\r\n“the roving bands of guerrillas and squads of robbers and murderers\r\nwho frequent those counties remote from the military forces.” He\r\nrecommended that the criminal law of the State be so revised as to\r\nmake house-stealing, and house-breaking, and highway robbery\r\npunishable with death. Acting upon his recommendations, the\r\nLegislature, in May, 1865, passed a bill to punish “all armed\r\nProwlers, Guerrillas, Brigands, and Highway Robbers.” But as yet there\r\nwere no indications, either in the message of the Governor or the\r\naction of the Legislature, that these early disturbances were of a\r\npolitical character.\r\n\r\nThe Ku-Klux Klan did not come into existence until the following year.\r\nThe little town of Pulaski, in Giles County, claims the doubtful honor\r\nof being its birthplace. It seems to have originated with a coterie of\r\nyoung men, who banded together for the purpose of obtaining amusement\r\nby playing upon the superstitious fancies of the negroes. They\r\norganized themselves into a lodge, and adopted a fantastic ceremony\r\nand ritual. Their meetings were held at night, and they usually came\r\ntogether mounted on horseback, and wearing hideous disguises. They\r\nfrightened the negroes by telling them horrible ghost stories.\r\n\r\nIt was quickly seen that the measures adopted purely for amusement\r\ncould be turned into practical use in controlling the negro. The\r\nconditions were ripe all over the South for such an organization, so\r\nit spread like wildfire. Lodges sprang up in all parts of the Southern\r\nStates, with the possible exception of Virginia. A loose bond of union\r\nwas formed between them, but in different localities they assumed\r\nvarious names, such as “The Pale Faces,” “The Invisible Empire,” “The\r\nBrotherhood.” They were all finally denominated “The Ku-Klux Klan.”\r\n\r\nSomewhat antedating the Ku-Klux Klan, and almost equally rapid in\r\ngrowth, were the Union secret societies. They also bore various names,\r\nthe most popular being “The Loyal League” and “The Union League of\r\nAmerica.” They were devoid of any fantastic features, and did not, as\r\na rule, resort to violent measures, but their object was the same as\r\nthe rival organization, namely, to secure political control of the\r\nnegro.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1867, the Radical newspapers of Knoxville, Nashville,\r\nand Memphis commenced to be filled with reports of outrages committed\r\nupon negroes and Union men. Upon investigation, these reports\r\noftentimes turned out to be either wholly untrue or greatly\r\nexaggerated, but they served to throw the Radical party into a state\r\nof intense excitement. Their leaders believed, or professed to\r\nbelieve, that another general insurrection was threatened. Acting\r\nunder this conviction, the Legislature passed a bill on the twentieth\r\nof February, 1867, to equip and call into active service, under the\r\nabsolute command of the Governor, a State Guard to be composed solely\r\nof Union men. It also passed a joint resolution requesting the\r\nGovernor to “apply to General Thomas, the commander of the department,\r\nfor a sufficient force of United States soldiers to keep the peace and\r\nrestore order and quiet in our State.”[14] In response to this\r\napplication several regiments were furnished by General Thomas, but he\r\ncautioned that they should be used only in aid of the civil authority.\r\n\r\nThese Ku-Klux outrages followed closely upon the passage of the Arnell\r\nFranchise Law. This bill, as we have pointed out, made the political\r\ndisabilities of the ex-Confederate absolute and perpetual. It\r\ndestroyed the last hope of regaining political control of the State,\r\nthrough legal and constitutional means. As a natural result, public\r\nopinion commenced to tolerate acts of violence which till then had\r\nbeen strongly condemned. The best men of the communities, while they\r\ndid not take active part in the Ku-Klux movement, gave it their\r\napproval by a policy of acquiescence. Juries refused to commit, even\r\nupon the clearest evidence, persons accused of offences against\r\nnegroes or Union men.\r\n\r\nA crisis was reached in the spring of 1868. Mr. S. M. Arnell, the\r\nframer of the election law and Congressman from the Eighth District,\r\nwas made the object of a Ku-Klux raid. Having narrowly escaped hanging\r\nthrough flight and concealment, he sent the following dispatch to the\r\nGovernor: “The Ku-Klux searched the train for me last night, pistols\r\nand rope in hand. Empower me to call upon the military here, if\r\nnecessary in your name, to suppress all armed and masked parties in\r\nthis vicinity. I propose to fight it out.“\r\n\r\nUpon the receipt of this dispatch, Governor Brownlow made a second\r\nrequest for federal troops. This time he received an unfavorable\r\nresponse. General Thomas informed him that “the State of Tennessee,\r\nbeing in full exercise of the civil functions of a State, the military\r\nauthority of the United States cannot legally interfere except in aid\r\nand support of the civil authority. For these purposes troops have\r\nbeen sent to various locations. These details, together with the\r\npresent demand for troops to assist the United States officers in\r\ncollecting revenue, have so exhausted the forces at my command as to\r\nprevent the complying with your request to send companies to the\r\ncounties named.”\r\n\r\nGovernor Brownlow now had recourse to an extra session of the\r\nLegislature. His message was couched in the most violent language.\r\n“The rebel element of the State,” he said, “were secretly arming\r\nthemselves, and perfecting a military organization, known as the\r\nKu-Klux Klan, composed of ex-rebel soldiers, and those in sympathy\r\nwith them, thus violating their paroles at the time of their\r\nsurrender, and violating the laws of the State, and plotting and\r\nplanning mischief in every respect.\r\n\r\n“These men have been arming and organizing for a year past, with an\r\neye to the overthrow of the State government, and, ultimately, to\r\ncarrying the State in the presidential election. Organized upon the\r\nsame basis, and having the same dark designs in view that found a fit\r\nculmination in Booth’s assassination of Abraham Lincoln, it works in\r\nsecret with signs, symbols, and pass-words, hatching plans to scatter\r\nanarchy and permanent disorder wherever it may have an existence. I\r\nrecommend, most emphatically, that these organized bands of assassins\r\nand robbers be declared outlaws by special Legislature, and punished\r\nwith death wherever found.”[15]\r\n\r\nThe violent language of the message aroused the greatest alarm among\r\nthe Democratic leaders of the State. They feared that if the measures\r\nrecommended by the Governor were adopted, civil war would indeed\r\nresult. A meeting was held at Nashville in August, and a memorial to\r\nthe Legislature was framed, by the following men, all of whom had been\r\ngenerals in the Confederate army: N. B. Forrest, B. F. Cheatham, W. B.\r\nBate, J. C. Brown, Bushrod Johnson, Gideon J. Pillow, W. A. Quarles,\r\nS. R. Anderson, G. G. Dibrell, and George Maney.\r\n\r\nIn this memorial they expressed a deep solicitude for the peace and\r\nquiet of the State, protested against the charge of hostility to the\r\nState government, or of a desire for its overthrow by revolutionary or\r\nlawless means, as well as against the charge that those who had been\r\nassociated with them in the past days contemplated any such rashness\r\nor folly; nor did they believe that there was in Tennessee any\r\norganization, public or secret, which had such a purpose, and that, if\r\nthere was, they had neither sympathy nor affiliation therewith. They\r\nfurther declared, that the peace of the State did not require a\r\nmilitary organization; that such a measure might bring about and\r\npromote collisions rather than conserve the harmony and good order of\r\nsociety; and finally that they would pledge themselves to maintain the\r\norder and peace of the State with whatever influence they possessed,\r\nand would uphold and support the laws and aid the constituted\r\nauthorities in their execution, trusting that a reciprocation of those\r\nsentiments would produce the enactment of such laws as would remove\r\nall causes disturbing society.\r\n\r\n“For,” they continued, “when it is remembered that the large mass of\r\nwhite men in Tennessee are denied the right to vote or to hold office,\r\nit is not wonderful or unnatural there should exist more or less\r\ndissatisfaction among them. And we beg leave respectfully to submit to\r\nyour consideration that prompt and efficient action on the part of the\r\nproper authorities, for the removal of the political disabilities\r\nresting upon so many of our people, would heal all the wounds of our\r\nState, and make us once more a prosperous, contented, and united\r\npeople.”[16]\r\n\r\nThis memorial came too late to allay the excited minds of the\r\nRadicals. On the 10th of September, the Legislature passed a bill “to\r\npreserve the public peace.” This bill imposes “a fine of not less than\r\nfive hundred dollars, and imprisonment in the penitentiary for not\r\nless than five years, and renders infamous any person who shall unite\r\nwith, associate with, promote or encourage any organization of persons\r\nwho shall prowl through the counties and towns of this State, by day\r\nor night, for the purpose of disturbing the peace or alarming the\r\npeaceful citizens of any part of the State. In order to secure the\r\nproper execution of this act, the same punishment is to be meted out\r\nto any person summoned as a witness, who shall fail or refuse to obey\r\nthe summons, or who shall appear and refuse to testify; the same to\r\nany prosecuting attorney who shall be informed of the violation of the\r\nact, and fail or refuse to prosecute the person informed on; the same\r\nto any officer or other person who shall inform any other person that\r\nhe was to be summoned as a witness, with the intent of defeating any\r\nof the provisions of the act; the same to any one who shall feed,\r\nlodge, or entertain or conceal in the woods, or elsewhere, any one\r\nknown to such person to be charged with an offence under the act.”\r\n\r\nThe act further provides, that “no indictment shall be required for\r\nprosecution, and no indictments held insufficient for want of form;\r\nthat where any sheriff or other officer shall return process issued\r\nunder the act, unexecuted, an alias shall issue, and the officer shall\r\ngive notice to the inhabitants of the county of such alias by posting\r\na notice at the court-house door, and if the inhabitants shall permit\r\nthe defendant to be or live in the county without arrest, they shall\r\nbe subject to an assessment of not less than five hundred dollars and\r\nnot more than five thousand dollars; that all the inhabitants of the\r\nState shall be authorized to arrest offenders under the act, without\r\nprocess; that every public officer shall swear that he has never been\r\na member of the Ku-Klux Klan.“ The measure of damages was as follows:\r\nFor entering the house or place of residence of any officer at night,\r\nin a hostile manner, or against his will, ten thousand dollars; and\r\nfor the killing of any peaceable individual at night, twenty thousand\r\ndollars. All other damages were to be assessed in proportion.[17]\r\n\r\nEven the passage of this extraordinary law did not satisfy Governor\r\nBrownlow. Under his guidance, the Legislature re-enacted the military\r\nlaws, and conferred upon him the power to declare martial law whenever\r\nand wherever he saw fit. He did not suffer this prerogative to remain\r\nidle. On the 20th of January, 1868, he called the State Guards into\r\nactive service. Several days later he issued the following\r\nproclamation:\r\n\r\n     “_Whereas_, There are now sixteen hundred State Guards at\r\n     Nashville armed and equipped under the command of Joseph\r\n     Cooper; and _Whereas_, These troops are intended to preserve\r\n     peace and enforce the laws in counties heretofore in partial\r\n     rebelion.\r\n\r\n     “Now, therefore, I, W. G. Brownlow, Governor of Tennessee,\r\n     do hereby proclaim martial law in and over the following\r\n     named counties, to wit: Overton, Jackson, Maury, Giles,\r\n     Marshall, Lawrence, Gibson, Madison, and Haywood.\r\n\r\n     “And I further direct that General Cooper distribute these\r\n     troops at once and continue them in service until\r\n     unmistakable evidence is given by all parties of a\r\n     disposition to keep the peace.\r\n\r\n                                  “W. G. BROWNLOW,\r\n                                      “_Governor of Tennessee_.”\r\n\r\nThe counties named in the proclamation were among the richest and most\r\npopulous in the State. Their prominent citizens were unanimous in\r\ncondemning what they conceived to be the tyrannical and arbitrary\r\naction of the Governor. The following is a fair sample of the numerous\r\nprotests made through the public press[18]:\r\n\r\n     “NASHVILLE, February 21, 1869. I see that martial law is\r\n     declared over the county of Lawrence, the county I have the\r\n     honor to represent, which I must acknowledge greatly\r\n     astonished me, for I know of no person or persons who\r\n     complained of any depredations in the county, or that there\r\n     was any difficulty at all in enforcing the law in said\r\n     county; but on the contrary, the people of the said county\r\n     are at this time, and have been for some months past, more\r\n     peaceable, quiet, and law-abiding than they have been for\r\n     the past ten years; and only a few days ago James H. MacKay,\r\n     sheriff, Ira J. Brown, clerk of the Circuit Court, and other\r\n     officials of said county in a written communication to the\r\n     Governor, stated that there was no difficulty in enforcing\r\n     the civil law in said county, and consequently no necessity\r\n     for the militia or other troops to enforce law, all of whom\r\n     are men of respectability and worthy of credit, and the\r\n     persons specially named above were soldiers of the Federal\r\n     army during the late Rebellion, and are all now, and always\r\n     have been, members of the Radical Republican party.\r\n\r\n     “I am at a loss to know why troops should have been\r\n     quartered upon the people of my county without consulting\r\n     their immediate Representative. I think surely some person\r\n     or persons have made misrepresentations to the Governor, and\r\n     sincerely hope that the order will be revoked and save my\r\n     people the mortification and expense of having troops\r\n     quartered amongst them in times of profound peace. ‘Let us\r\n     have peace.’\r\n\r\n                                    “W. P. H. TURNER,\r\n                          “_Representative, Lawrence County_.”\r\n\r\nGovernor Brownlow answered these protests by declaring his intention\r\nto further extend the sway of martial law. But fortunately for the\r\npeace of the State, only a few days of his term as Governor remained.\r\nUnder his successor the troops were withdrawn and the military laws\r\nwere repealed. A state of tranquillity quickly ensued.\r\n\r\n\r\n     [14] Acts of Tennessee, 1867-68, p. 22.\r\n\r\n     [15] Acts of Tennessee, Extra Session, 1868.\r\n\r\n     [16] See _Why the Solid South_, by Hilary Herbert, and others.\r\n\r\n     [17] Acts of Tennessee, Extra Session, 1868, p. 18.\r\n\r\n     [18] _Union and American_, February 21, 1869.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nCLOSE OF THE RADICAL DOMINATION\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the recognition of the loyal government by Congress, the only\r\nhope of the disfranchised ex-Confederates of regaining political\r\ncontrol of the State lay in a division in the ranks of the Union\r\nparty. So long as Governor Brownlow remained at the head of affairs,\r\nno such division occurred. He served as Governor the full term of two\r\nyears, and was re-elected. Before the expiration of his second term,\r\nhe was chosen by the Legislature to represent Tennessee in the United\r\nStates Senate. According to a provision of the State constitution, the\r\nvacant governorship descended to De Witt Senter, Speaker of the State\r\nSenate. Mr. Senter was inducted into office on the 29th of February,\r\n1868.\r\n\r\nThree years had now passed since the close of the war, and the\r\nrestoration of civil government, but the majority of the white\r\ncitizens still remained disfranchised, and no steps had been taken to\r\nremove their disqualifications. In speaking of this aspect of the\r\nsituation, Mr. Fletcher, Secretary of the State, said: “Our mistake\r\nwas that we made the franchise law sweeping and perpetual, offering no\r\nhope or inducement to the ex-rebel to become loyal. The man who is\r\ndisfranchised in a republic is not apt to feel that it is his\r\ngovernment, or to take pride or interest in it, nor apt to make a\r\nuseful or even law-abiding citizen of it. I do not feel comfortable in\r\na State where half of the people and two thirds of the tax-payers are\r\npublicly degraded by law, without motive to be proud of the State and\r\ngovernment.”\r\n\r\nUpon the day of Governor Senter’s inauguration, the air was filled\r\nwith rumors and signs of coming changes. Whether it would be a violent\r\neruption or a peaceful change through constitutional means, no one\r\ncould foresee. In the great crowd which gathered at the Capitol to\r\nhear the inaugural address, there was noticed by the press reporters a\r\nnumber of distinguished Southern leaders. This in itself was\r\nconsidered a harbinger of the coming storm. The address proved\r\ndisappointing to all. It was expected that the Governor would give\r\nsome intimation of the policy he intended to pursue, but he simply\r\nexpressed his appreciation of the office to which he had been\r\nelevated, and his desire to see peace and prosperity restored to the\r\nState.\r\n\r\nThere was little of interest in the character or career of the new\r\nGovernor. He was born in Granger County in 1833. His father, William\r\nF. Senter, had represented the Second Congressional District in the\r\nTwenty-eighth Congress. Although Governor Senter had been chosen\r\nSpeaker of the Radical Senate he had never shown himself an extreme\r\npartisan. He had even been a member of the secession Legislature of\r\n1861; but Congress had relieved him of his political disabilities on\r\nthe 22d of December, 1868. It was therefore with a hopeful expectancy\r\nthat the people of Tennessee hailed his advent into the office of\r\nGovernor.\r\n\r\nBut before Governor Senter could make any change in the\r\nadministration, the State was plunged into a heated campaign to elect\r\nhis successor. He was entitled by the Constitution to serve out\r\nBrownlow’s unexpired term, but only a few months remained of that. His\r\naspirations naturally went beyond his brief _pro tem._ term, and he,\r\ntherefore, announced his intention of becoming a candidate subject to\r\nthe approval of the Union party.\r\n\r\nA new candidate soon appeared in the person of W. B. Stokes. Mr.\r\nStokes was the Representative of the Third District in Congress. His\r\nrecord had been somewhat similar to that of Governor Senter. At the\r\nbeginning of the war he had identified himself with the secession\r\nmovement, but had quickly deserted what he saw to be a sinking ship.\r\nAfter the war, as if to make amends for his past conduct, he became\r\none of the most extreme and bitter Radicals.\r\n\r\nAt first, the canvass was a mere personal contest, having little\r\nsignificance to any one except the Radical leaders. A Convention of\r\nthe Union party was called to meet in Nashville on May 22d. Both\r\ncandidates pledged themselves to abide by the decision of this\r\nConvention.\r\n\r\nEx-President Johnson’s return to Tennessee at this time added to the\r\nuncertainty of the contest. He was still a power in Tennessee\r\npolitics, and it was rumored that he might enter the race as a\r\nConservative Democrat. The Radical Convention assembled in Nashville\r\non the day appointed. It was called to order by Thos. Cates, chairman\r\nof the Central Committee, who was a Stokes man. After the reading of\r\nthe call, Judge Houck moved that Mr. Pearne, a friend of Governor\r\nSenter, be made temporary chairman of the Convention. His motion\r\nhaving failed to be recognized by Mr. Cates, he put it to the House\r\nhimself and declared Mr. Pearne elected. Mr. Pearne attempted to reach\r\nthe chair, but was forcibly prevented. This resulted in a hand-to-hand\r\ncontest between the delegates. Failing to perfect a temporary\r\norganization, the Convention adjourned until the following day. But at\r\nthe second meeting the disgraceful scenes of the first were repeated.\r\nIt finally dissolved amid the utmost confusion.\r\n\r\n_The Union and American_, a daily newspaper, published in Nashville,\r\ncontained the following report of the Convention’s proceedings.\r\n\r\n     “The so-called Radical State Convention, the most\r\n     disgraceful, profane, and vulgar assemblage of men ever\r\n     congregated in the State to consider public affairs, came to\r\n     an abrupt termination yesterday, after an ineffectual\r\n     attempt of two days to organize. It simply dissolved. It\r\n     could not even adjourn. It had no chairman, no secretary,\r\n     and could not even transact any business. It met as if by\r\n     chance, and dispersed from necessity. It was an agglomerate\r\n     discord, an inflamed mob filled with mean whiskey and meaner\r\n     passions. It was a meeting of mortal enemies under the guise\r\n     of friendship to decide the spoils of misdeeds and crimes.\r\n     They quarrelled and fought, and called each other liars and\r\n     thieves, and all manner of epithets. Such a congregation of\r\n     vulgar elements, so fierce, so bitter, and so reckless, was\r\n     never seen before in this section of the Union.\r\n\r\n     “This assemblage of Radicals was called together to counsel\r\n     for the good of the State, and present to the people a\r\n     person of such fair name and true patriotism as to be worthy\r\n     of them and the State for their chief executive!”\r\n\r\nThe above description was written by a “rebel” editor, but the\r\nfollowing account, taken from the _Knoxville Whig_, is scarcely less\r\nsevere: “We share in the regret of all good Republicans that the late\r\nConvention was so divided, boisterous, disrupted. We have attended\r\nmany conventions, national and State. We never attended one in which\r\nsuch injustice, violence, and fraud were practised.”\r\n\r\nThese two pictures of the Convention, drawn from different\r\nstandpoints, give us some idea of the kind of men that had ruled\r\nTennessee for four years. At last the household was divided against\r\nitself; it was only a matter of a few weeks until it should fall.\r\n\r\nThe Senter faction attempted to throw the blame for the disrupted\r\nConvention upon Mr. Stokes and his friends. They denied the charge,\r\nand asserted that at least sixty-four counties had been instructed for\r\nMr. Stokes, which would have insured him the nomination. The result of\r\nthe discussion was that Governor Senter and Mr. Stokes declared their\r\nintentions to “fight it to a finish at the polls.” They began at\r\nNashville, January 5th, a joint canvass of the State. A direct issue\r\nwas soon made between them on the franchise question. Governor Senter\r\ndeclared “that the time has come, and is now, when the limitations and\r\ndisabilities which have found their way into our statute-books, as the\r\nresult of the war, should be abolished and removed, and the privilege\r\nof the elective franchise be restored, and extended so far as to\r\nembrace the mass of the adult population of the State.”\r\n\r\nMr. Stokes thus defined his position: “When the killing of Union men\r\nceases, the hellish organization of Ku-Klux is abandoned, and the laws\r\nare observed, then I am willing to entertain a proposition to amend\r\nthe State constitution so far as to allow the disfranchised to come in\r\ngradually, by providing that the Legislature may by a two thirds vote\r\nremove the disabilities for those who petition, and come well\r\nrecommended by their loyal neighbors.”\r\n\r\nAfter these declarations of principles the struggle became one of\r\nparamount importance to the whole people of the State.\r\n\r\nAs the time for the election approached, and the official registration\r\nbegan, signs of uneasiness appeared among the supporters of Mr.\r\nStokes. They felt confident that the majority of the Radical votes\r\nwere for their candidate, but they realized that Governor Senter was\r\n“master of the situation.” He had control of the same machinery\r\nGovernor Brownlow had employed so successfully in changing the results\r\nof Congressional and State elections. Would Governor Senter use this\r\nin his own behalf, thus destroying the Radical party with an\r\ninstrument of their making? This question was asked and discussed both\r\nupon the stump and in the newspapers.\r\n\r\nThe election occurred on the 5th day of August. At the same time the\r\nelection for the State Legislature was held. The issue was the same as\r\nin the gubernatorial contest――that is, universal suffrage or continued\r\ndisfranchisement. Contrary to expectations, the election passed\r\nwithout any serious conflicts or disturbances of the peace. The result\r\nwas not long in doubt. It could be seen on the following day from the\r\npartial returns that Governor Senter had been elected by an enormous\r\nmajority.\r\n\r\nThe official returns were as follows:\r\n\r\n                        SENTER.    STOKES.\r\n\r\n     East Tennesssee     23,877    22,471\r\n     Middle   ”          58,646    19,149\r\n     West     ”          37,681    13,209\r\n                        -------    ------\r\n                        120,204    54,874\r\n                         54,874\r\n                        -------    ------\r\n     Senter’s majority   65,330\r\n\r\nThe Conservative candidates to the Legislature, who stood upon the\r\nsame platform as Governor Senter, were elected almost to a man.\r\n\r\nImmediately after election, Mr. Stokes and his friends raised the cry\r\nof fraud. They lost no time in hurrying to Washington in order to\r\nbring pressure to bear upon President Grant to declare the election\r\nvoid. Mr. Stokes set forth his claims in a lengthy interview. He said\r\nin part: “Governor Senter being governor or acting-governor had the\r\nappointment of the registrars of the election. He put in such men as\r\nhe thought would do his bidding. They at once opened the flood-gates\r\nand let everybody in, the disfranchising clauses of the Constitution\r\nwere trodden under foot and entirely disregarded, certificates of\r\nqualification as voters were issued to disfranchised rebels, and even\r\nboys of sixteen and seventeen were allowed to vote. Besides this there\r\nwas a course of intimidation pursued under the instruction of Senter\r\nwhich prevented hundreds of Republicans from voting. You see Senter\r\nwas governor. He had militia and intended to use them, if necessary,\r\nto elect himself. In many cases where the rebels had the upper hand\r\nthe Republicans, especially the negroes, could not vote in their\r\nprecincts for fear of violence. What defeated me was the rebels who\r\nwere disfranchised under the constitution. I got 56,000, which was\r\nGrant’s vote last fall. Seymour’s was 33,000 last fall, but Senter’s\r\nvote was this time 119,000. The 86,000 additional which Senter got\r\nwere rebels and minors.”\r\n\r\nThese charges made by Mr. Stokes were replied to in the daily press by\r\nGovernor Senter. He claimed that it was unfair to compare the vote in\r\nthe recent election with the presidential election of the previous\r\nfall. In the presidential election the Republicans were sure of the\r\nresult in the State, so they had made no effort to bring out a full\r\nvote. It would be much fairer to take the vote cast in the\r\ngubernatorial election of 1867 as the standard by which to measure the\r\nresult of the recent election. In 1867, Governor Brownlow’s vote was\r\n19,900 more than Mr. Stokes had received, yet the registration of 1867\r\nexceeded the vote cast by over 20,000. The old registration law was\r\nstill in force, but had been modified by a decision of the Supreme\r\nCourt which admitted at least 40,000 votes which had been kept out in\r\n1867. In other words, Mr. Senter claimed he could have received a\r\nmajority of 20,000 had there been no new registration. The newly\r\nappointed registrars, referred to in Mr. Stokes’s interview, were,\r\nwith the exception of three tenths, regularly discharged Federal\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\nMr. Stokes in his efforts to secure Federal intervention was supported\r\nby all the Radical leaders. Many of those who had supported Governor\r\nSenter in the election were now most active in the attempt to prevent\r\nhis induction into office. Among the first to change front was Mr.\r\nBrownlow. Early in the contest he had favored the nomination of\r\nGovernor Senter. After the disruption of the Radical Convention, he\r\nstill continued to support Governor Senter. It was not until after\r\nelection that he seemed to realize that Governor Senter’s victory\r\nmeant the return to power of the ex-Confederate and consequently the\r\ndownfall of Radical domination.\r\n\r\nPresident Grant turned a deaf ear to the entreaties of the Radical\r\nleaders. They sought Congressional action, but met defeat here also,\r\nas Congress passed a resolution thanking President Grant for his\r\nrefusal to interfere with affairs in Tennessee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nCONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION OF 1870\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the Radical leaders were engaged in their futile efforts at\r\nWashington to obtain Federal intervention, the Legislature convened at\r\nNashville, and Governor Senter was inaugurated with the usual\r\nceremony. Both the Governor and the Legislature manifested a desire to\r\nfulfill their election pledges, by restoring the franchise to the\r\nex-Confederates, but the manner in which this should be accomplished\r\nwas not at first very apparent.\r\n\r\nIn the Constitution, as it was prior to the war, the suffrage\r\nqualifications had been clearly stated and no power had been vested in\r\nthe Legislature to alter them. It was in virtue of the amendments\r\nadopted by the Radical Convention of 1865, that the Legislature had\r\npassed the disfranchising acts of 1866 and 1867.\r\n\r\nThe simple repeal of these acts would have re-enfranchised the\r\nex-Confederates, but it would have left unsettled a number of\r\nperplexing problems resulting from the war. It was felt that the\r\nsolution of these questions should not be left to the Legislature, as\r\nits members were all Union men, and therefore did not represent the\r\nwhole political body. It was also recognized that the questions to be\r\nsettled were of a constitutional character, and could be properly\r\ndealt with only by a constitutional Convention.\r\n\r\nThese considerations led to the passage of an act which authorized the\r\nGovernor to put to a vote of the people the question of holding a\r\nconstitutional Convention. At the same election delegates were to be\r\nchosen. Every male person not convicted of infamous crime, of the age\r\nof twenty-one, and a citizen of the United States, and a citizen of\r\nthe State of Tennessee was allowed to vote. The election was held on\r\nthe 3d of December and resulted in a large majority in favor of the\r\nConvention.\r\n\r\nThe first constitutional Convention in the history of the State was\r\nthe one which had met in Knoxville, and framed the Constitution under\r\nwhich Tennessee had been admitted into the Union.[19] Conspicuous\r\namong the members of the first Convention were John Sevier and Andrew\r\nJackson. The constitution they adopted was modelled after that of the\r\nmother State, North Carolina. In 1834, a second Convention met at\r\nNashville, and modified the old Constitution, so as to bring it into\r\nharmony with the industrial changes of the first quarter of a century.\r\nThe next assertion of constituent powers was in 1861, when the\r\nLegislature passed the Declaration of Independence, and the Ordinance\r\nof Union with the Confederacy. In 1865, the Radical Convention, as we\r\nhave seen, framed a number of constitutional amendments.\r\n\r\nThe newly elected convention assembled at Nashville on the 10th day of\r\nJanuary. The character of its members was a guaranty that its action\r\nwould be Conservative. It has been pronounced the most intelligent\r\nbody ever elected in Tennessee for any purpose. John C. Brown, an\r\nex-major-general of the Confederate army, was elected to preside over\r\nits deliberations. As the Authorization Act did not limit the power of\r\nthe Convention, it was at liberty to enter into a thorough-going\r\nprovision of the constitution, but it manifested from the start the\r\nintention to confine itself to the task of settling the question\r\ngrowing out of the war. Chief among these was negro suffrage.\r\n\r\nThe Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States had\r\nnot yet been adopted, so it was still in the power of the State to\r\nwithhold the franchise from the negro. In the discussion of this\r\nsuffrage question, the Convention was divided into three factions. The\r\nUnion delegates, who were greatly in the minority, favored universal\r\nsuffrage. The extreme opposite opinion was expressed in the minority\r\nreport of the Suffrage Committee: “We hold that the negro race is the\r\nlowest order of human beings, incapable in themselves of a virtuous\r\nintelligence, or free government; and for the truth, we appeal to\r\nhistory, and challenge the world to show a single exception. We hold\r\nthat the inferiority of the negro to the white man, in race, color,\r\nand capacity for permanent, well-ordered government has been fixed by\r\nHim who ‘doeth all things well,’ and whose natural or revealed law has\r\nnever been violated by any human government without disaster and\r\nconfusion.”\r\n\r\nIn the abstract, the above statement undoubtedly represented the view\r\nof a majority of the delegates. But the conservative men of the\r\nConvention recognized that the rejection of negro suffrage would\r\nstrengthen the Radicals in their efforts to obtain Federal\r\nintervention. Considerations of political expediency led, therefore,\r\nto the adoption of the following provision in regard to suffrage:\r\n“Every male person of the age of twenty-one years, being a citizen of\r\nthe United States, and a resident of this State for twelve months, and\r\nof the county wherein he may offer his vote, for six months next\r\npreceding the day of election, shall be entitled to vote for members\r\nof the General Assembly, and all civil officers of the county or\r\ndistrict in which he resides, and there shall be no qualification\r\nattached to the right of suffrage, except that each voter shall give\r\nto the judge of the election, where he offers to vote, satisfactory\r\nevidence that he has paid the poll taxes assessed against him for such\r\npreceding period as the Legislature shall prescribe, and at such time\r\nas may be prescribed by law, without which his vote cannot be\r\nreceived.”[20]\r\n\r\nAfter fixing the suffrage qualifications, all the important changes in\r\nthe constitution proposed by the Convention, were directed, with\r\npossibly two exceptions, towards the prevention of the recurrence of\r\nthe political abuses, from which the State had suffered under the\r\nRadical administration. Fresh in the minds of all were the arbitrary\r\nacts of Governor Brownlow in suspending the writ of habeas corpus, and\r\nproclaiming martial law. A number of limitations were, therefore,\r\nplaced upon the military power of the Governor. It was provided that\r\n“the militia shall not be called into service except in case of\r\nrebellion or invasion, and then only when the General Assembly shall\r\ndeclare by law that the public safety requires it.” The Bill of Rights\r\nwas so amended that “the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended,\r\nunless when, in case of rebellion or invasion, the General Assembly\r\nshall declare the public safety requires it.”\r\n\r\nAnother flagrant abuse under Radical rules had been the too frequent\r\nmeeting of the Legislature. During the four years of Governor\r\nBrownlow’s administration, it had been in almost continuous session.\r\nTo remedy this, regular sessions were made biennial, and it was\r\nprovided that no member “shall be paid for more than seventy days of\r\nthe regular session, or for more than twenty days of an extra or\r\ncalled session.”\r\n\r\nThe two important changes in the constitution, which had no relation\r\nto the disturbed political conditions resulting from the war, were the\r\ncreation of a homestead exemption, and the delegation to the\r\nLegislature of the power to pass general laws for the organization of\r\nprivate corporations.\r\n\r\nHaving completed its labors, the Convention proceeded to the Capitol,\r\nand, in the presence of both Houses of the Legislature, it placed the\r\nrevised constitution in the hands of the Governor. By him it was\r\nsubmitted to a vote of the people, and ratified by a vote of 98,128\r\nfor, to 33,872 against.\r\n\r\nAt the first State election that occurred under the provisions of the\r\nnew Constitution, the Democrats regained political control of the\r\nState.
