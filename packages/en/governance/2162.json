The motives of any persons to pursue such a\r\n     profession must be different from those of trade, deeper\r\n     than pride, and stronger than interest.\r\n                                       GEORGE JACOB HOLYOAKE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the men and women prominent in the public life of America there\r\nare but few whose names are mentioned as often as that of Emma\r\nGoldman.  Yet the real Emma Goldman is almost quite unknown.  The\r\nsensational press has surrounded her name with so much\r\nmisrepresentation and slander, it would seem almost a miracle that,\r\nin spite of this web of calumny, the truth breaks through and a\r\nbetter appreciation of this much maligned idealist begins to manifest\r\nitself.  There is but little consolation in the fact that almost\r\nevery representative of a new idea has had to struggle and suffer\r\nunder similar difficulties.  Is it of any avail that a former\r\npresident of a republic pays homage at Osawatomie to the memory of\r\nJohn Brown?  Or that the president of another republic participates\r\nin the unveiling of a statue in honor of Pierre Proudhon, and holds\r\nup his life to the French nation as a model worthy of enthusiastic\r\nemulation?  Of what avail is all this when, at the same time, the\r\nLIVING John Browns and Proudhons are being crucified?  The honor and\r\nglory of a Mary Wollstonecraft or of a Louise Michel are not enhanced\r\nby the City Fathers of London or Paris naming a street after\r\nthem--the living generation should be concerned with doing justice to\r\nthe LIVING Mary Wollstonecrafts and Louise Michels.  Posterity\r\nassigns to men like Wendel Phillips and Lloyd Garrison the proper\r\nniche of honor in the temple of human emancipation; but it is the\r\nduty of their contemporaries to bring them due recognition and\r\nappreciation while they live.\r\n\r\nThe path of the propagandist of social justice is strewn with thorns.\r\nThe powers of darkness and injustice exert all their might lest a ray\r\nof sunshine enter his cheerless life.  Nay, even his comrades in the\r\nstruggle--indeed, too often his most intimate friends--show but\r\nlittle understanding for the personality of the pioneer.  Envy,\r\nsometimes growing to hatred, vanity and jealousy, obstruct his way\r\nand fill his heart with sadness.  It requires an inflexible will and\r\ntremendous enthusiasm not to lose, under such conditions, all faith\r\nin the Cause.  The representative of a revolutionizing idea stands\r\nbetween two fires: on the one hand, the persecution of the existing\r\npowers which hold him responsible for all acts resulting from social\r\nconditions; and, on the other, the lack of understanding on the part\r\nof his own followers who often judge all his activity from a narrow\r\nstandpoint.  Thus it happens that the agitator stands quite alone in\r\nthe midst of the multitude surrounding him.  Even his most intimate\r\nfriends rarely understand how solitary and deserted he feels.  That\r\nis the tragedy of the person prominent in the public eye.\r\n\r\nThe mist in which the name of Emma Goldman has so long been enveloped\r\nis gradually beginning to dissipate.  Her energy in the furtherance\r\nof such an unpopular idea as Anarchism, her deep earnestness, her\r\ncourage and abilities, find growing understanding and admiration.\r\n\r\nThe debt American intellectual growth owes to the revolutionary\r\nexiles has never been fully appreciated.  The seed disseminated by\r\nthem, though so little understood at the time, has brought a rich\r\nharvest.  They have at all times held aloft the banner of liberty,\r\nthus impregnating the social vitality of the Nation.  But very few\r\nhave succeeding in preserving their European education and culture\r\nwhile at the same time assimilating themselves with American life.\r\nIt is difficult for the average man to form an adequate conception\r\nwhat strength, energy, and perseverance are necessary to absorb the\r\nunfamiliar language, habits, and customs of a new country, without\r\nthe loss of one's own personality.\r\n\r\nEmma Goldman is one of the few who, while thoroughly preserving their\r\nindividuality, have become an important factor in the social and\r\nintellectual atmosphere of America.  The life she leads is rich in\r\ncolor, full of change and variety.  She has risen to the topmost\r\nheights, and she has also tasted the bitter dregs of life.\r\n\r\nEmma Goldman was born of Jewish parentage on the 27th day of June,\r\n1869, in the Russian province of Kovno.  Surely these parents never\r\ndreamed what unique position their child would some day occupy.  Like\r\nall conservative parents they, too, were quite convinced that their\r\ndaughter would marry a respectable citizen, bear him children, and\r\nround out her allotted years surrounded by a flock of grandchildren,\r\na good, religious woman.  As most parents, they had no inkling what a\r\nstrange, impassioned spirit would take hold of the soul of their\r\nchild, and carry it to the heights which separate generations in\r\neternal struggle.  They lived in a land and at a time when antagonism\r\nbetween parent and offspring was fated to find its most acute\r\nexpression, irreconcilable hostility.  In this tremendous struggle\r\nbetween fathers and sons--and especially between parents and\r\ndaughters--there was no compromise, no weak yielding, no truce.  The\r\nspirit of liberty, of progress--an idealism which knew no\r\nconsiderations and recognized no obstacles--drove the young\r\ngeneration out of the parental house and away from the hearth of the\r\nhome.  Just as this same spirit once drove out the revolutionary\r\nbreeder of discontent, Jesus, and alienated him from his native\r\ntraditions.\r\n\r\nWhat role the Jewish race--notwithstanding all anti-semitic calumnies\r\nthe race of transcendental idealism--played in the struggle of the\r\nOld and the New will probably never be appreciated with complete\r\nimpartiality and clarity.  Only now are we beginning to perceive the\r\ntremendous debt we owe to Jewish idealists in the realm of science,\r\nart, and literature.  But very little is still known of the important\r\npart the sons and daughters of Israel have played in the\r\nrevolutionary movement and, especially, in that of modern times.\r\n\r\nThe first years of her childhood Emma Goldman passed in a small,\r\nidyllic place in the German-Russian province of Kurland, where her\r\nfather had charge of the government stage.  At the time Kurland was\r\nthoroughly German; even the Russian bureaucracy of that Baltic\r\nprovince was recruited mostly from German JUNKERS.  German fairy\r\ntales and stories, rich in the miraculous deeds of the heroic knights\r\nof Kurland, wove their spell over the youthful mind.  But the\r\nbeautiful idyl was of short duration.  Soon the soul of the growing\r\nchild was overcast by the dark shadows of life.  Already in her\r\ntenderest youth the seeds of rebellion and unrelenting hatred of\r\noppression were to be planted in the heart of Emma Goldman.  Early\r\nshe learned to know the beauty of the State: she saw her father\r\nharassed by the Christian CHINOVNIKS and doubly persecuted as petty\r\nofficial and hated Jew.  The brutality of forced conscription ever\r\nstood before her eyes: she beheld the young men, often the sole\r\nsupporter of a large family, brutally dragged to the barracks to lead\r\nthe miserable life of a soldier.  She heard the weeping of the poor\r\npeasant women, and witnessed the shameful scenes of official venality\r\nwhich relieved the rich from military service at the expense of the\r\npoor.  She was outraged by the terrible treatment to which the female\r\nservants were subjected: maltreated and exploited by their BARINYAS,\r\nthey fell to the tender mercies of the regimental officers, who\r\nregarded them as their natural sexual prey.  The girls, made pregnant\r\nby respectable gentlemen and driven out by their mistresses, often\r\nfound refuge in the Goldman home.  And the little girl, her heart\r\npalpitating with sympathy, would abstract coins from the parental\r\ndrawer to clandestinely press the money into the hands of the\r\nunfortunate women.  Thus Emma Goldman's most striking characteristic,\r\nher sympathy with the underdog, already became manifest in these\r\nearly years.\r\n\r\nAt the age of seven little Emma was sent by her parents to her\r\ngrandmother at Konigsberg, the city of Emanuel Kant, in Eastern\r\nPrussia.  Save for occasional interruptions, she remained there till her\r\n13th birthday.  The first years in these surroundings do not exactly\r\nbelong to her happiest recollections.  The grandmother, indeed, was\r\nvery amiable, but the numerous aunts of the household were concerned\r\nmore with the spirit of practical rather than pure reason, and the\r\ncategoric imperative was applied all too frequently.  The situation\r\nwas changed when her parents migrated to Konigsberg, and little Emma\r\nwas relieved from her role of Cinderella.  She now regularly attended\r\npublic school and also enjoyed the advantages of private instruction,\r\ncustomary in middle class life; French and music lessons played an\r\nimportant part in the curriculum.  The future interpreter of Ibsen\r\nand Shaw was then a little German Gretchen, quite at home in the\r\nGerman atmosphere.  Her special predilections in literature were the\r\nsentimental romances of Marlitt; she was a great admirer of the good\r\nQueen Louise, whom the bad Napoleon Buonaparte treated with so marked\r\na lack of knightly chivalry.  What might have been her future\r\ndevelopment had she remained in this milieu?  Fate--or was it\r\neconomic necessity?--willed it otherwise.  Her parents decided to\r\nsettle in St. Petersburg, the capital of the Almighty Tsar, and there\r\nto embark in business.  It was here that a great change took place in\r\nthe life of the young dreamer.\r\n\r\nIt was an eventful period--the year of 1882--in which Emma Goldman,\r\nthen in her 13th year, arrived in St. Petersburg.  A struggle for\r\nlife and death between the autocracy and the Russian intellectuals\r\nswept the country.  Alexander II had fallen the previous year.\r\nSophia Perovskaia, Zheliabov, Grinevitzky, Rissakov, Kibalchitch,\r\nMichailov, the heroic executors of the death sentence upon the\r\ntyrant, had then entered the Walhalla of immortality.  Jessie\r\nHelfman, the only regicide whose life the government had reluctantly\r\nspared because of pregnancy, followed the unnumbered Russian martyrs\r\nto the etapes of Siberia.  It was the most heroic period in the great\r\nbattle of emancipation, a battle for freedom such as the world had\r\nnever witnessed before.  The names of the Nihilist martyrs were on\r\nall lips, and thousands were enthusiastic to follow their example.\r\nThe whole INTELLIGENZIA of Russia was filled with the ILLEGAL\r\nspirit: revolutionary sentiments penetrated into every home, from\r\nmansion to hovel, impregnating the military, the CHINOVNIKS, factory\r\nworkers, and peasants.  The atmosphere pierced the very casemates of\r\nthe royal palace.  New ideas germinated in the youth.  The difference\r\nof sex was forgotten.  Shoulder to shoulder fought the men and the\r\nwomen.  The Russian woman!  Who shall ever do justice or adequately\r\nportray her heroism and self-sacrifice, her loyalty and devotion?\r\nHoly, Turgeniev calls her in his great prose poem, ON THE THRESHOLD.\r\n\r\nIt was inevitable that the young dreamer from Konigsberg should be\r\ndrawn into the maelstrom.  To remain outside of the circle of free\r\nideas meant a life of vegetation, of death.  One need not wonder at\r\nthe youthful age.  Young enthusiasts were not then--and, fortunately,\r\nare not now--a rare phenomenon in Russia.  The study of the Russian\r\nlanguage soon brought young Emma Goldman in touch with revolutionary\r\nstudents and new ideas.  The place of Marlitt was taken by Nekrassov\r\nand Tchernishevsky.  The quondam admirer of the good Queen Louise\r\nbecame a glowing enthusiast of liberty, resolving, like thousands of\r\nothers, to devote her life to the emancipation of the people.\r\n\r\nThe struggle of generations now took place in the Goldman family.\r\nThe parents could not comprehend what interest their daughter could\r\nfind in the new ideas, which they themselves considered fantastic\r\nutopias.  They strove to persuade the young girl out of these\r\nchimeras, and daily repetition of soul-racking disputes was the\r\nresult.  Only in one member of the family did the young idealist find\r\nunderstanding--in her elder sister, Helene, with whom she later\r\nemigrated to America, and whose love and sympathy have never failed\r\nher.  Even in the darkest hours of later persecution Emma Goldman\r\nalways found a haven of refuge in the home of this loyal sister.\r\n\r\nEmma Goldman finally resolved to achieve her independence.  She saw\r\nhundreds of men and women sacrificing brilliant careers to go V\r\nNAROD, to the people.  She followed their example.  She became a\r\nfactory worker; at first employed as a corset maker, and later in the\r\nmanufacture of gloves.  She was now 17 years of age and proud to earn\r\nher own living.  Had she remained in Russia, she would have probably\r\nsooner or later shared the fate of thousands buried in the snows of\r\nSiberia.  But a new chapter of life was to begin for her.  Sister\r\nHelene decided to emigrate to America, where another sister had\r\nalready made her home.  Emma prevailed upon Helene to be allowed to\r\njoin her, and together they departed for America, filled with the\r\njoyous hope of a great, free land, the glorious Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmerica!  What magic word.  The yearning of the enslaved, the\r\npromised land of the oppressed, the goal of all longing for progress.\r\nHere man's ideals had found their fulfillment: no Tsar, no Cossack,\r\nno CHINOVNIK.  The Republic!  Glorious synonym of equality, freedom,\r\nbrotherhood.\r\n\r\nThus thought the two girls as they travelled, in the year 1886, from\r\nNew York to Rochester.  Soon, all too soon, disillusionment awaited\r\nthem.  The ideal conception of America was punctured already at\r\nCastle Garden, and soon burst like a soap bubble.  Here Emma Goldman\r\nwitnessed sights which reminded her of the terrible scenes of her\r\nchildhood in Kurland.  The brutality and humiliation the future\r\ncitizens of the great Republic were subjected to on board ship, were\r\nrepeated at Castle Garden by the officials of the democracy in a more\r\nsavage and aggravating manner.  And what bitter disappointment\r\nfollowed as the young idealist began to familiarize herself with the\r\nconditions in the new land!  Instead of one Tsar, she found scores of\r\nthem; the Cossack was replaced by the policeman with the heavy club,\r\nand instead of the Russian CHINOVNIK there was the far more inhuman\r\nslave-driver of the factory.\r\n\r\nEmma Goldman soon obtained work in the clothing establishment of the\r\nGarson Co.  The wages amounted to two and a half dollars a week.  At\r\nthat time the factories were not provided with motor power, and the\r\npoor sewing girls had to drive the wheels by foot, from early morning\r\ntill late at night.  A terribly exhausting toil it was, without a ray\r\nof light, the drudgery of the long day passed in complete\r\nsilence--the Russian custom of friendly conversation at work was not\r\npermissible in the free country.  But the exploitation of the girls\r\nwas not only economic; the poor wage workers were looked upon by\r\ntheir foremen and bosses as sexual commodities.  If a girl resented\r\nthe advances of her \"superiors\", she would speedily find herself on\r\nthe street as an undesirable element in the factory.  There was never\r\na lack of willing victims: the supply always exceeded the demand.\r\n\r\nThe horrible conditions were made still more unbearable by the\r\nfearful dreariness of life in the small American city.  The Puritan\r\nspirit suppresses the slightest manifestation of joy; a deadly\r\ndullness beclouds the soul; no intellectual inspiration, no thought\r\nexchange between congenial spirits is possible.  Emma Goldman almost\r\nsuffocated in this atmosphere.  She, above all others, longed for\r\nideal surroundings, for friendship and understanding, for the\r\ncompanionship of kindred minds.  Mentally she still lived in Russia.\r\nUnfamiliar with the language and life of the country, she dwelt more\r\nin the past than in the present.  It was at this period that she met\r\na young man who spoke Russian.  With great joy the acquaintance was\r\ncultivated.  At last a person with whom she could converse, one who\r\ncould help her bridge the dullness of the narrow existence.  The\r\nfriendship gradually ripened and finally culminated in marriage.\r\n\r\nEmma Goldman, too, had to walk the sorrowful road of married life;\r\nshe, too, had to learn from bitter experience that legal statutes\r\nsignify dependence and self-effacement, especially for the woman.\r\nThe marriage was no liberation from the Puritan dreariness of\r\nAmerican life; indeed, it was rather aggravated by the loss of\r\nself-ownership.  The characters of the young people differed too\r\nwidely.  A separation soon followed, and Emma Goldman went to New\r\nHaven, Conn.  There she found employment in a factory, and her\r\nhusband disappeared from her horizon.  Two decades later she was\r\nfated to be unexpectedly reminded of him by the Federal authorities.\r\n\r\nThe revolutionists who were active in the Russian movement of the\r\n80's were but little familiar with the social ideas then agitating\r\nWestern Europe and America.  Their sole activity consisted in\r\neducating the people, their final goal the destruction of the\r\nautocracy.  Socialism and Anarchism were terms hardly known even by\r\nname.  Emma Goldman, too, was entirely unfamiliar with the\r\nsignificance of those ideals.\r\n\r\nShe arrived in America, as four years previously in Russia, at a\r\nperiod of great social and political unrest.  The working people were\r\nin revolt against the terrible labor conditions; the eight-hour\r\nmovement of the Knights of Labor was at its height, and throughout\r\nthe country echoed the din of sanguine strife between strikers and\r\npolice.  The struggle culminated in the great strike against the\r\nHarvester Company of Chicago, the massacre of the strikers, and the\r\njudicial murder of the labor leaders, which followed upon the\r\nhistoric Haymarket bomb explosion.  The Anarchists stood the martyr\r\ntest of blood baptism.  The apologists of capitalism vainly seek to\r\njustify the killing of Parsons, Spies, Lingg, Fischer, and Engel.\r\nSince the publication of Governor Altgeld's reason for his liberation\r\nof the three incarcerated Haymarket Anarchists, no doubt is left that\r\na fivefold legal murder had been committed in Chicago, in 1887.\r\n\r\nVery few have grasped the significance of the Chicago martyrdom;\r\nleast of all the ruling classes.  By the destruction of a number of\r\nlabor leaders they thought to stem the tide of a world-inspiring\r\nidea.  They failed to consider that from the blood of the martyrs\r\ngrows the new seed, and that the frightful injustice will win new\r\nconverts to the Cause.\r\n\r\nThe two most prominent representatives of the Anarchist idea in\r\nAmerica, Voltairine de Cleyre and Emma Goldman--the one a native\r\nAmerican, the other a Russian--have been converted, like numerous\r\nothers, to the ideas of Anarchism by the judicial murder.  Two women\r\nwho had not known each other before, and who had received a widely\r\ndifferent education, were through that murder united in one idea.\r\n\r\nLike most working men and women of America, Emma Goldman followed the\r\nChicago trial with great anxiety and excitement.  She, too, could not\r\nbelieve that the leaders of the proletariat would be killed.  The\r\n11th of November, 1887, taught her differently.  She realized that no\r\nmercy could be expected from the ruling class, that between the\r\nTsarism of Russia and the plutocracy of America there was no\r\ndifference save in name.  Her whole being rebelled against the crime,\r\nand she vowed to herself a solemn vow to join the ranks of the\r\nrevolutionary proletariat and to devote all her energy and strength\r\nto their emancipation from wage slavery.  With the glowing enthusiasm\r\nso characteristic of her nature, she now began to familiarize herself\r\nwith the literature of Socialism and Anarchism.  She attended public\r\nmeetings and became acquainted with socialistically and\r\nanarchistically inclined workingmen.  Johanna Greie, the well-known\r\nGerman lecturer, was the first Socialist speaker heard by Emma\r\nGoldman.  In New Haven, Conn., where she was employed in a corset\r\nfactory, she met Anarchists actively participating in the movement.\r\nHere she read the FREIHEIT, edited by John Most.  The Haymarket\r\ntragedy developed her inherent Anarchist tendencies: the reading of\r\nthe FREIHEIT made her a conscious Anarchist.  Subsequently she was to\r\nlearn that the idea of Anarchism found its highest expression through\r\nthe best intellects of America: theoretically by Josiah Warren,\r\nStephen Pearl Andrews, Lysander Spooner; philosophically by Emerson,\r\nThoreau, and Walt Whitman.\r\n\r\nMade ill by the excessive strain of factory work, Emma Goldman\r\nreturned to Rochester where she remained till August, 1889, at which\r\ntime she removed to New York, the scene of the most important phase\r\nof her life.  She was now twenty years old.  Features pallid with\r\nsuffering, eyes large and full of compassion, greet one in her\r\npictured likeness of those days.  Her hair is, as customary with\r\nRussian student girls, worn short, giving free play to the strong\r\nforehead.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is the heroic epoch of militant Anarchism.  By leaps and bounds\r\nthe movement had grown in every country.  In spite of the most severe\r\ngovernmental persecution new converts swell the ranks.  The\r\npropaganda is almost exclusively of a secret character.  The\r\nrepressive measures of the government drive the disciples of the new\r\nphilosophy to conspirative methods.  Thousands of victims fall into\r\nthe hands of the authorities and languish in prisons.  But nothing\r\ncan stem the rising tide of enthusiasm, of self-sacrifice and\r\ndevotion to the Cause.  The efforts of teachers like Peter Kropotkin,\r\nLouise Michel, Elisee Reclus, and others, inspire the devotees with\r\never greater energy.\r\n\r\nDisruption is imminent with the Socialists, who have sacrificed the\r\nidea of liberty and embraced the State and politics.  The struggle is\r\nbitter, the factions irreconcilable.  This struggle is not merely\r\nbetween Anarchists and Socialists; it also finds its echo within the\r\nAnarchist groups.  Theoretic differences and personal controversies\r\nlead to strife and acrimonious enmities.  The anti-Socialist\r\nlegislation of Germany and Austria had driven thousands of Socialists\r\nand Anarchists across the seas to seek refuge in America.  John Most,\r\nhaving lost his seat in the Reichstag, finally had to flee his native\r\nland, and went to London.  There, having advanced toward Anarchism,\r\nhe entirely withdrew from the Social Democratic Party.  Later, coming\r\nto America, he continued the publication of the FREIHEIT in New York,\r\nand developed great activity among the German workingmen.\r\n\r\nWhen Emma Goldman arrived in New York in 1889, she experienced little\r\ndifficulty in associating herself with active Anarchists.  Anarchist\r\nmeetings were an almost daily occurrence.  The first lecturer she\r\nheard on the Anarchist platform was Dr. A. Solotaroff.  Of great\r\nimportance to her future development was her acquaintance with John\r\nMost, who exerted a tremendous influence over the younger elements.\r\nHis impassioned eloquence, untiring energy, and the persecution he\r\nhad endured for the Cause, all combined to enthuse the comrades.  It\r\nwas also at this period that she met Alexander Berkman, whose\r\nfriendship played an important part throughout her life.  Her talents\r\nas a speaker could not long remain in obscurity.  The fire of\r\nenthusiasm swept her toward the public platform.  Encouraged by her\r\nfriends, she began to participate as a German and Yiddish speaker at\r\nAnarchist meetings.  Soon followed a brief tour of agitation taking\r\nher as far as Cleveland.  With the whole strength and earnestness of\r\nher soul she now threw herself into the propaganda of Anarchist\r\nideas.  The passionate period of her life had begun.  Through\r\nconstantly toiling in sweat shops, the fiery young orator was at the\r\nsame time very active as an agitator and participated in various\r\nlabor struggles, notably in the great cloakmakers' strike, in 1889,\r\nled by Professor Garsyde and Joseph Barondess.\r\n\r\nA year later Emma Goldman was a delegate to an Anarchist conference\r\nin New York.  She was elected to the Executive Committee, but later\r\nwithdrew because of differences of opinion regarding tactical\r\nmatters.  The ideas of the German-speaking Anarchists had at that\r\ntime not yet become clarified.  Some still believed in parliamentary\r\nmethods, the great majority being adherents of strong centralism.\r\nThese differences of opinion in regard to tactics led in 1891 to a\r\nbreach with John Most.  Emma Goldman, Alexander Berkman, and other\r\ncomrades joined the group AUTONOMY, in which Joseph Peukert, Otto\r\nRinke, and Claus Timmermann played an active part.  The bitter\r\ncontroversies which followed this secession terminated only with the\r\ndeath of Most, in 1906.\r\n\r\nA great source of inspiration to Emma Goldman proved the Russian\r\nrevolutionists who were associated in the group ZNAMYA.  Goldenberg,\r\nSolotaroff, Zametkin, Miller, Cahan, the poet Edelstadt, Ivan von\r\nSchewitsch, husband of Helene von Racowitza and editor of the\r\nVOLKSZEITUNG, and numerous other Russian exiles, some of whom are\r\nstill living, were members of this group.  It was also at this time\r\nthat Emma Goldman met Robert Reitzel, the German-American Heine, who\r\nexerted a great influence on her development.  Through him she became\r\nacquainted with the best writers of modern literature, and the\r\nfriendship thus begun lasted till Reitzel's death, in 1898.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe labor movement of America had not been drowned in the Chicago\r\nmassacre; the murder of the Anarchists had failed to bring peace to\r\nthe profit-greedy capitalist.  The struggle for the eight-hour day\r\ncontinued.  In 1892 broke out the great strike in Pittsburg.  The\r\nHomestead fight, the defeat of the Pinkertons, the appearance of the\r\nmilitia, the suppression of the strikers, and the complete triumph of\r\nthe reaction are matters of comparatively recent history.  Stirred to\r\nthe very depths by the terrible events at the seat of war, Alexander\r\nBerkman resolved to sacrifice his life to the Cause and thus give an\r\nobject lesson to the wage slaves of America of active Anarchist\r\nsolidarity with labor.  His attack upon Frick, the Gessler of\r\nPittsburg, failed, and the twenty-two-year-old youth was doomed to a\r\nliving death of twenty-two years in the penitentiary.  The\r\nbourgeoisie, which for decades had exalted and eulogized tyrannicide,\r\nnow was filled with terrible rage.  The capitalist press organized a\r\nsystematic campaign of calumny and misrepresentation against\r\nAnarchists.  The police exerted every effort to involve Emma Goldman\r\nin the act of Alexander Berkman.  The feared agitator was to be\r\nsilenced by all means.  It was only due to the circumstance of her\r\npresence in New York that she escaped the clutches of the law.  It\r\nwas a similar circumstance which, nine years later, during the\r\nMcKinley incident, was instrumental in preserving her liberty.  It is\r\nalmost incredible with what amount of stupidity, baseness, and\r\nvileness the journalists of the period sought to overwhelm the\r\nAnarchist.  One must peruse the newspaper files to realize the\r\nenormity of incrimination and slander.  It would be difficult to\r\nportray the agony of soul Emma Goldman experienced in those days.\r\nThe persecutions of the capitalist press were to be borne by an\r\nAnarchist with comparative equanimity; but the attacks from one's own\r\nranks were far more painful and unbearable.  The act of Berkman was\r\nseverely criticized by Most and some of his followers among the\r\nGerman and Jewish Anarchists.  Bitter accusations and recriminations\r\nat public meetings and private gatherings followed.  Persecuted on\r\nall sides, both because she championed Berkman and his act, and on\r\naccount of her revolutionary activity, Emma Goldman was harassed even\r\nto the extent of inability to secure shelter.  Too proud to seek\r\nsafety in the denial of her identity, she chose to pass the nights in\r\nthe public parks rather than expose her friends to danger or vexation\r\nby her visits.  The already bitter cup was filled to overflowing by\r\nthe attempted suicide of a young comrade who had shared living\r\nquarters with Emma Goldman, Alexander Berkman, and a mutual artist\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany changes have since taken place.  Alexander Berkman has survived\r\nthe Pennsylvania Inferno, and is back again in the ranks of the\r\nmilitant Anarchists, his spirit unbroken, his soul full of enthusiasm\r\nfor the ideals of his youth.  The artist comrade is now among the\r\nwell-known illustrators of New York.  The suicide candidate left\r\nAmerica shortly after his unfortunate attempt to die, and was\r\nsubsequently arrested and condemned to eight years of hard labor for\r\nsmuggling Anarchist literature into Germany.  He, too, has withstood\r\nthe terrors of prison life, and has returned to the revolutionary\r\nmovement, since earning the well deserved reputation of a talented\r\nwriter in Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo avoid indefinite camping in the parks Emma Goldman finally was\r\nforced to move into a house on Third Street, occupied exclusively by\r\nprostitutes.  There, among the outcasts of our good Christian\r\nsociety, she could at least rent a bit of a room, and find rest and\r\nwork at her sewing machine.  The women of the street showed more\r\nrefinement of feeling and sincere sympathy than the priests of the\r\nChurch.  But human endurance had been exhausted by overmuch suffering\r\nand privation.  There was a complete physical breakdown, and the\r\nrenowned agitator was removed to the \"Bohemian Republic\"--a large\r\ntenement house which derived its euphonious appellation from the fact\r\nthat its occupants were mostly Bohemian Anarchists.  Here Emma\r\nGoldman found friends ready to aid her.  Justus Schwab, one of the\r\nfinest representatives of the German revolutionary period of that\r\ntime, and Dr. Solotaroff were indefatigable in the care of the\r\npatient.  Here, too, she met Edward Brady, the new friendship\r\nsubsequently ripening into close intimacy.  Brady had been an active\r\nparticipant in the revolutionary movement of Austria and had, at the\r\ntime of his acquaintance with Emma Goldman, lately been released from\r\nan Austrian prison after an incarceration of ten years.\r\n\r\nPhysicians diagnosed the illness as consumption, and the patient was\r\nadvised to leave New York.  She went to Rochester, in the hope that\r\nthe home circle would help restore her to health.  Her parents had\r\nseveral years previously emigrated to America, settling in that city.\r\nAmong the leading traits of the Jewish race is the strong attachment\r\nbetween the members of the family, and, especially, between parents\r\nand children.  Though her conservative parents could not sympathize\r\nwith the idealist aspirations of Emma Goldman and did not approve of\r\nher mode of life, they now received their sick daughter with open\r\narms.  The rest and care enjoyed in the parental home, and the\r\ncheering presence of the beloved sister Helene, proved so beneficial\r\nthat within a short time she was sufficiently restored to resume her\r\nenergetic activity.\r\n\r\nThere is no rest in the life of Emma Goldman.  Ceaseless effort and\r\ncontinuous striving toward the conceived goal are the essentials of\r\nher nature.  Too much precious time had already been wasted.  It was\r\nimperative to resume her labors immediately.  The country was in the\r\nthroes of a crisis, and thousands of unemployed crowded the streets\r\nof the large industrial centers.  Cold and hungry they tramped\r\nthrough the land in the vain search for work and bread.  The\r\nAnarchists developed a strenuous propaganda among the unemployed and\r\nthe strikers.  A monster demonstration of striking cloakmakers and of\r\nthe unemployed took place at Union Square, New York.  Emma Goldman\r\nwas one of the invited speakers.  She delivered an impassioned\r\nspeech, picturing in fiery words the misery of the wage slave's life,\r\nand quoted the famous maxim of Cardinal Manning: \"Necessity knows no\r\nlaw, and the starving man has a natural right to a share of his\r\nneighbor's bread.\"  She concluded her exhortation with the words:\r\n\"Ask for work.  If they do not give you work, ask for bread.  If they\r\ndo not give you work or bread, then take bread.\"\r\n\r\nThe following day she left for Philadelphia, where she was to address\r\na public meeting.  The capitalist press again raised the alarm.  If\r\nSocialists and Anarchists were to be permitted to continue agitating,\r\nthere was imminent danger that the workingmen would soon learn to\r\nunderstand the manner in which they are robbed of the joy and\r\nhappiness of life.  Such a possibility was to be prevented at all\r\ncost.  The Chief of Police of New York, Byrnes, procured a court\r\norder for the arrest of Emma Goldman.  She was detained by the\r\nPhiladelphia authorities and incarcerated for several days in the\r\nMoyamensing prison, awaiting the extradition papers which Byrnes\r\nintrusted to Detective Jacobs.  This man Jacobs (whom Emma Goldman\r\nagain met several years later under very unpleasant circumstances)\r\nproposed to her, while she was returning a prisoner to New York, to\r\nbetray the cause of labor.  In the name of his superior, Chief\r\nByrnes, he offered lucrative reward.  How stupid men sometimes are!\r\nWhat poverty of psychologic observation to imagine the possibility of\r\nbetrayal on the part of a young Russian idealist, who had willingly\r\nsacrificed all personal considerations to help in labor's\r\nemancipation.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1893, Emma Goldman was tried in the criminal courts of\r\nNew York on the charge of inciting to riot.  The \"intelligent\" jury\r\nignored the testimony of the twelve witnesses for the defense in\r\nfavor of the evidence given by one single man--Detective Jacobs.  She\r\nwas found guilty and sentenced to serve one year in the penitentiary\r\nat Blackwell's Island.  Since the foundation of the Republic she was\r\nthe first woman--Mrs. Surratt excepted--to be imprisoned for a\r\npolitical offense.  Respectable society had long before stamped upon\r\nher the Scarlet Letter.\r\n\r\nEmma Goldman passed her time in the penitentiary in the capacity of\r\nnurse in the prison hospital.  Here she found opportunity to shed\r\nsome rays of kindness into the dark lives of the unfortunates whose\r\nsisters of the street did not disdain two years previously to share\r\nwith her the same house.  She also found in prison opportunity to\r\nstudy English and its literature, and to familiarize herself with the\r\ngreat American writers.  In Bret Harte, Mark Twain, Walt Whitman,\r\nThoreau, and Emerson she found great treasures.\r\n\r\nShe left Blackwell's Island in the month of August, 1894, a woman of\r\ntwenty-five, developed and matured, and intellectually transformed.\r\nBack into the arena, richer in experience, purified by suffering.\r\nShe did not feel herself deserted and alone any more.  Many hands\r\nwere stretched out to welcome her.  There were at the time numerous\r\nintellectual oases in New York.  The saloon of Justus Schwab, at\r\nNumber Fifty, First Street, was the center where gathered Anarchists,\r\nlitterateurs, and bohemians.  Among others she also met at this time\r\na number of American Anarchists, and formed the friendship of\r\nVoltairine de Cleyre, Wm. C. Owen, Miss Van Etton, and Dyer D. Lum,\r\nformer editor of the ALARM and executor of the last wishes of the\r\nChicago martyrs.  In John Swinton, the noble old fighter for liberty,\r\nshe found one of her staunchest friends.  Other intellectual centers\r\nthere were: SOLIDARITY, published by John Edelman; LIBERTY, by the\r\nIndividualist Anarchist, Benjamin R. Tucker; the REBEL, by Harry\r\nKelly; DER STURMVOGEL, a German Anarchist publication, edited by\r\nClaus Timmermann; DER ARME TEUFEL, whose presiding genius was the\r\ninimitable Robert Reitzel.  Through Arthur Brisbane, now chief\r\nlieutenant of William Randolph Hearst, she became acquainted with the\r\nwritings of Fourier.  Brisbane then was not yet submerged in the\r\nswamp of political corruption.  He sent Emma Goldman an amiable\r\nletter to Blackwell's Island, together with the biography of his\r\nfather, the enthusiastic American disciple of Fourier.\r\n\r\nEmma Goldman became, upon her release from the penitentiary, a factor\r\nin the public life of New York.  She was appreciated in radical ranks\r\nfor her devotion, her idealism, and earnestness.  Various persons\r\nsought her friendship, and some tried to persuade her to aid in the\r\nfurtherance of their special side issues.  Thus Rev. Parkhurst,\r\nduring the Lexow investigation, did his utmost to induce her to join\r\nthe Vigilance Committee in order to fight Tammany Hall.  Maria\r\nLouise, the moving spirit of a social center, acted as Parkhurst's\r\ngo-between.  It is hardly necessary to mention what reply the latter\r\nreceived from Emma Goldman.  Incidentally, Maria Louise subsequently\r\nbecame a Mahatma.  During the free silver campaign, ex-Burgess\r\nMcLuckie, one of the most genuine personalities in the Homestead\r\nstrike, visited New York in an endeavor to enthuse the local radicals\r\nfor free silver.  He also attempted to interest Emma Goldman, but\r\nwith no greater success than Mahatma Maria Louise of Parkhurst-Lexow\r\nfame.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1894 the struggle of the Anarchists in France reached its highest\r\nexpression.  The white terror on the part of the Republican upstarts\r\nwas answered by the red terror of our French comrades.  With feverish\r\nanxiety the Anarchists throughout the world followed this social\r\nstruggle.  Propaganda by deed found its reverberating echo in almost\r\nall countries.  In order to better familiarize herself with\r\nconditions in the old world, Emma Goldman left for Europe, in the\r\nyear 1895.  After a lecture tour in England and Scotland, she went to\r\nVienna where she entered the ALLGEMEINE KRANKENHAUS to prepare\r\nherself as midwife and nurse, and where at the same time she studied\r\nsocial conditions.  She also found opportunity to acquaint herself\r\nwith the newest literature of Europe: Hauptmann, Nietzsche, Ibsen,\r\nZola, Thomas Hardy, and other artist rebels were read with great\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1896 she returned to New York by way of Zurich and\r\nParis.  The project of Alexander Berkman's liberation was on hand.\r\nThe barbaric sentence of twenty-two years had roused tremendous\r\nindignation among the radical elements.  It was known that the Pardon\r\nBoard of Pennsylvania would look to Carnegie and Frick for advice in\r\nthe case of Alexander Berkman.  It was therefore suggested that these\r\nSultans of Pennsylvania be approached--not with a view of obtaining\r\ntheir grace, but with the request that they do not attempt to\r\ninfluence the Board.  Ernest Crosby offered to see Carnegie, on\r\ncondition that Alexander Berkman repudiate his act.  That, however,\r\nwas absolutely out of the question.  He would never be guilty of such\r\nforswearing of his own personality and self-respect.  These efforts\r\nled to friendly relations between Emma Goldman and the circle of\r\nErnest Crosby, Bolton Hall, and Leonard Abbott.  In the year 1897 she\r\nundertook her first great lecture tour, which extended as far as\r\nCalifornia.  This tour popularized her name as the representative of\r\nthe oppressed, her eloquence ringing from coast to coast.  In\r\nCalifornia Emma Goldman became friendly with the members of the Isaak\r\nfamily, and learned to appreciate their efforts for the Cause.  Under\r\ntremendous obstacles the Isaaks first published the FIREBRAND and,\r\nupon its suppression by the Postal Department, the FREE SOCIETY.  It\r\nwas also during this tour that Emma Goldman met that grand old rebel\r\nof sexual freedom, Moses Harman.\r\n\r\nDuring the Spanish-American war the spirit of chauvinism was at its\r\nhighest tide.  To check this dangerous situation, and at the same\r\ntime collect funds for the revolutionary Cubans, Emma Goldman became\r\naffiliated with the Latin comrades, among others with Gori, Esteve,\r\nPalaviccini, Merlino, Petruccini, and Ferrara.  In the year 1899\r\nfollowed another protracted tour of agitation, terminating on the\r\nPacific Coast.  Repeated arrests and accusations, though without\r\nultimate bad results, marked every propaganda tour.\r\n\r\nIn November of the same year the untiring agitator went on a second\r\nlecture tour to England and Scotland, closing her journey with the\r\nfirst International Anarchist Congress at Paris.  It was at the time of\r\nthe Boer war, and again jingoism was at its height, as two years\r\npreviously it had celebrated its orgies during the Spanish-American\r\nwar.  Various meetings, both in England and Scotland, were disturbed\r\nand broken up by patriotic mobs.  Emma Goldman found on this occasion\r\nthe opportunity of again meeting various English comrades and\r\ninteresting personalities like Tom Mann and the sisters Rossetti, the\r\ngifted daughters of Dante Gabriel Rossetti, then publishers of the\r\nAnarchist review, the TORCH.  One of her life-long hopes found here\r\nits fulfillment: she came in close and friendly touch with Peter\r\nKropotkin, Enrico Malatesta, Nicholas Tchaikovsky, W. Tcherkessov,\r\nand Louise Michel.  Old warriors in the cause of humanity, whose\r\ndeeds have enthused thousands of followers throughout the world, and\r\nwhose life and work have inspired other thousands with noble idealism\r\nand self-sacrifice.  Old warriors they, yet ever young with the\r\ncourage of earlier days, unbroken in spirit and filled with the firm\r\nhope of the final triumph of Anarchy.\r\n\r\nThe chasm in the revolutionary labor movement, which resulted from\r\nthe disruption of the INTERNATIONALE, could not be bridged any more.\r\nTwo social philosophies were engaged in bitter combat.  The\r\nInternational Congress in 1889, at Paris; in 1892, at Zurich, and in\r\n1896, at London, produced irreconcilable differences.  The majority\r\nof Social Democrats, forswearing their libertarian past and becoming\r\npoliticians, succeeded in excluding the revolutionary and Anarchist\r\ndelegates.  The latter decided thenceforth to hold separate\r\ncongresses.  Their first congress was to take place in 1900, at\r\nParis.  The Socialist renegade, Millerand, who had climbed into the\r\nMinistry of the Interior, here played a Judas role.  The congress of\r\nthe revolutionists was suppressed, and the delegates dispersed two\r\ndays prior to their scheduled opening.  But Millerand had no\r\nobjections against the Social Democratic Congress, which was\r\nafterwards opened with all the trumpets of the advertiser's art.\r\n\r\nHowever, the renegade did not accomplish his object.  A number of\r\ndelegates succeeded in holding a secret conference in the house of a\r\ncomrade outside of Paris, where various points of theory and tactics\r\nwere discussed.  Emma Goldman took considerable part in these\r\nproceedings, and on that occasion came in contact with numerous\r\nrepresentatives of the Anarchist movement of Europe.\r\n\r\nOwing to the suppression of the congress, the delegates were in\r\ndanger of being expelled from France.  At this time also came the bad\r\nnews from America regarding another unsuccessful attempt to liberate\r\nAlexander Berkman, proving a great shock to Emma Goldman.  In\r\nNovember, 1900, she returned to America to devote herself to her\r\nprofession of nurse, at the same time taking an active part in the\r\nAmerican propaganda.  Among other activities she organized monster\r\nmeetings of protest against the terrible outrages of the Spanish\r\ngovernment, perpetrated upon the political prisoners tortured in\r\nMontjuich.\r\n\r\nIn her vocation as nurse Emma Goldman enjoyed many opportunities of\r\nmeeting the most unusual and peculiar characters.  Few would have\r\nidentified the \"notorious Anarchist\" in the small blonde woman,\r\nsimply attired in the uniform of a nurse.  Soon after her return from\r\nEurope she became acquainted with a patient by the name of Mrs.\r\nStander, a morphine fiend, suffering excruciating agonies.  She\r\nrequired careful attention to enable her to supervise a very\r\nimportant business she conducted,--that of Mrs. Warren.  In Third\r\nStreet, near Third Avenue, was situated her private residence, and\r\nnear it, connected by a separate entrance, was her place of business.\r\nOne evening, the nurse, upon entering the room of her patient,\r\nsuddenly came face to face with a male visitor, bull-necked and of\r\nbrutal appearance.  The man was no other than Mr. Jacobs, the\r\ndetective who seven years previously had brought Emma Goldman a\r\nprisoner from Philadelphia and who had attempted to persuade her, on\r\ntheir way to New York, to betray the cause of the workingmen.  It\r\nwould be difficult to describe the expression of bewilderment on the\r\ncountenance of the man as he so unexpectedly faced Emma Goldman, the\r\nnurse of his mistress.  The brute was suddenly transformed into a\r\ngentleman, exerting himself to excuse his shameful behavior on the\r\nprevious occasion.  Jacobs was the \"protector\" of Mrs. Stander, and\r\ngo-between for the house and the police.  Several years later, as one\r\nof the detective staff of District Attorney Jerome, he committed\r\nperjury, was convicted, and sent to Sing Sing for a year.  He is now\r\nprobably employed by some private detective agency, a desirable\r\npillar of respectable society.\r\n\r\nIn 1901 Peter Kropotkin was invited by the Lowell Institute of\r\nMassachusetts to deliver a series of lectures on Russian literature.\r\nIt was his second American tour, and naturally the comrades were\r\nanxious to use his presence for the benefit of the movement.  Emma\r\nGoldman entered into correspondence with Kropotkin and succeeded in\r\nsecuring his consent to arrange for him a series of lectures.  She\r\nalso devoted her energies to organizing the tours of other well known\r\nAnarchists, principally those of Charles W. Mowbray and John Turner.\r\nSimilarly she always took part in all the activities of the movement,\r\never ready to give her time, ability, and energy to the Cause.\r\n\r\nOn the sixth of September, 1901, President McKinley was shot by Leon\r\nCzolgosz at Buffalo.  Immediately an unprecedented campaign of\r\npersecution was set in motion against Emma Goldman as the best known\r\nAnarchist in the country.  Although there was absolutely no\r\nfoundation for the accusation, she, together with other prominent\r\nAnarchists, was arrested in Chicago, kept in confinement for several\r\nweeks, and subjected to severest cross-examination.  Never before in\r\nthe history of the country had such a terrible man-hunt taken place\r\nagainst a person in public life.  But the efforts of police and press\r\nto connect Emma Goldman with Czolgosz proved futile.  Yet the episode\r\nleft her wounded to the heart.  The physical suffering, the\r\nhumiliation and brutality at the hands of the police she could bear.\r\nThe depression of soul was far worse.  She was overwhelmed by\r\nrealization of the stupidity, lack of understanding, and vileness\r\nwhich characterized the events of those terrible days.  The attitude\r\nof misunderstanding on the part of the majority of her own comrades\r\ntoward Czolgosz almost drove her to desperation.  Stirred to the very\r\ninmost of her soul, she published an article on Czolgosz in which she\r\ntried to explain the deed in its social and individual aspects.  As\r\nonce before, after Berkman's act, she now also was unable to find\r\nquarters; like a veritable wild animal she was driven from place to\r\nplace.  This terrible persecution and, especially, the attitude of\r\nher comrades made it impossible for her to continue propaganda.  The\r\nsoreness of body and soul had first to heal.  During 1901-1903 she\r\ndid not resume the platform.  As \"Miss Smith\" she lived a quiet life,\r\npracticing her profession and devoting her leisure to the study of\r\nliterature and, particularly, to the modern drama, which she\r\nconsiders one of the greatest disseminators of radical ideas and\r\nenlightened feeling.\r\n\r\nYet one thing the persecution of Emma Goldman accomplished.  Her name\r\nwas brought before the public with greater frequency and emphasis\r\nthan ever before, the malicious harassing of the much maligned\r\nagitator arousing strong sympathy in many circles.  Persons in\r\nvarious walks of life began to get interested in her struggle and her\r\nideas.  A better understanding and appreciation were now beginning to\r\nmanifest themselves.\r\n\r\nThe arrival in America of the English Anarchist, John Turner, induced\r\nEmma Goldman to leave her retirement.  Again she threw herself into\r\nher public activities, organizing an energetic movement for the\r\ndefense of Turner, whom the Immigration authorities condemned to\r\ndeportation on account of the Anarchist exclusion law, passed after\r\nthe death of McKinley.\r\n\r\nWhen Paul Orleneff and Mme. Nazimova arrived in New York to acquaint\r\nthe American public with Russian dramatic art, Emma Goldman became\r\nthe manager of the undertaking.  By much patience and perseverance\r\nshe succeeded in raising the necessary funds to introduce the Russian\r\nartists to the theater-goers of New York and Chicago.  Though\r\nfinancially not a success, the venture proved of great artistic\r\nvalue.  As manager of the Russian theater Emma Goldman enjoyed some\r\nunique experiences.  M. Orleneff could converse only in Russian, and\r\n\"Miss Smith\" was forced to act as his interpreter at various polite\r\nfunctions.  Most of the aristocratic ladies of Fifth Avenue had not\r\nthe least inkling that the amiable manager who so entertainingly\r\ndiscussed philosophy, drama, and literature at their five o'clock\r\nteas, was the \"notorious\" Emma Goldman.  If the latter should some\r\nday write her autobiography, she will no doubt have many interesting\r\nanecdotes to relate in connection with these experiences.\r\n\r\nThe weekly Anarchist publication, FREE SOCIETY, issued by the Isaak\r\nfamily, was forced to suspend in consequence of the nation-wide fury\r\nthat swept the country after the death of McKinley.  To fill out the\r\ngap Emma Goldman, in co-operation with Max Baginski and other\r\ncomrades, decided to publish a monthly magazine devoted to the\r\nfurtherance of Anarchist ideas in life and literature.  The first\r\nissue of MOTHER EARTH appeared in the month of March, 1906, the\r\ninitial expenses of the periodical partly covered by the proceeds of\r\na theater benefit given by Orleneff, Mme. Nazimova, and their\r\ncompany, in favor of the Anarchist magazine.  Under tremendous\r\ndifficulties and obstacles the tireless propagandist has succeeded in\r\ncontinuing MOTHER EARTH uninterruptedly since 1906--an achievement\r\nrarely equalled in the annals of radical publications.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1906, Alexander Berkman at last left the hell of\r\nPennsylvania, where he had passed the best fourteen years of his\r\nlife.  No one had believed in the possibility of his survival.  His\r\nliberation terminated a nightmare of fourteen years for Emma Goldman,\r\nand an important chapter of her career was thus concluded.\r\n\r\nNowhere had the birth of the Russian revolution aroused such vital\r\nand active response as among the Russians living in America.  The\r\nheroes of the revolutionary movement in Russia, Tchaikovsky, Mme.\r\nBreshkovskaia, Gershuni, and others visited these shores to waken the\r\nsympathies of the American people toward the struggle for liberty,\r\nand to collect aid for its continuance and support.  The success of\r\nthese efforts was to a considerable extent due to the exertions,\r\neloquence, and the talent for organization on the part of Emma\r\nGoldman.  This opportunity enabled her to give valuable services to\r\nthe struggle for liberty in her native land.  It is not generally\r\nknown that it is the Anarchists who are mainly instrumental in\r\ninsuring the success, moral as well as financial, of most of the\r\nradical undertakings.  The Anarchist is indifferent to acknowledged\r\nappreciation; the needs of the Cause absorb his whole interest, and\r\nto these he devotes his energy and abilities.  Yet it may be\r\nmentioned that some otherwise decent folks, though at all times\r\nanxious for Anarchist support and co-operation, are ever willing to\r\nmonopolize all the credit for the work done.  During the last several\r\ndecades it was chiefly the Anarchists who had organized all the great\r\nrevolutionary efforts, and aided in every struggle for liberty.  But\r\nfor fear of shocking the respectable mob, who looks upon the\r\nAnarchists as the apostles of Satan, and because of their social\r\nposition in bourgeois society, the would-be radicals ignore the\r\nactivity of the Anarchists.\r\n\r\nIn 1907 Emma Goldman participated as delegate to the second Anarchist\r\nCongress, at Amsterdam.  She was intensely active in all its\r\nproceedings and supported the organization of the Anarchist\r\nINTERNATIONALE.  Together with the other American delegate, Max\r\nBaginski, she submitted to the congress an exhaustive report of\r\nAmerican conditions, closing with the following characteristic\r\nremarks:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The charge that Anarchism is destructive, rather than constructive,\r\nand that, therefore, Anarchism is opposed to organization, is one of\r\nthe many falsehoods spread by our opponents.  They confound our\r\npresent social institutions with organization; hence they fail to\r\nunderstand how we can oppose the former, and yet favor the latter.\r\nThe fact, however, is that the two are not identical.\r\n\r\n\"The State is commonly regarded as the highest form of organization.\r\nBut is it in reality a true organization?  Is it not rather an\r\narbitrary institution, cunningly imposed upon the masses?\r\n\r\n\"Industry, too, is called an organization; yet nothing is farther\r\nfrom the truth.  Industry is the ceaseless piracy of the rich against\r\nthe poor.\r\n\r\n\"We are asked to believe that the Army is an organization, but a\r\nclose investigation will show that it is nothing else than a cruel\r\ninstrument of blind force.\r\n\r\n\"The Public School!  The colleges and other institutions of learning,\r\nare they not models of organization, offering the people fine\r\nopportunities for instruction?  Far from it.  The school, more than\r\nany other institution, is a veritable barrack, where the human mind\r\nis drilled and manipulated into submission to various social and\r\nmoral spooks, and thus fitted to continue our system of exploitation\r\nand oppression.\r\n\r\n\"Organization, as WE understand it, however, is a different thing.\r\nIt is based, primarily, on freedom.  It is a natural and voluntary\r\ngrouping of energies to secure results beneficial to humanity.\r\n\r\n\"It is the harmony of organic growth which produces variety of color\r\nand form, the complete whole we admire in the flower.  Analogously\r\nwill the organized activity of free human beings, imbued with the\r\nspirit of solidarity, result in the perfection of social harmony,\r\nwhich we call Anarchism.  In fact, Anarchism alone makes\r\nnon-authoritarian organization of common interests possible, since it\r\nabolishes the existing antagonism between individuals and classes.\r\n\r\n\"Under present conditions the antagonism of economic and social\r\ninterests results in relentless war among the social units, and\r\ncreates an insurmountable obstacle in the way of a co-operative\r\ncommonwealth.\r\n\r\n\"There is a mistaken notion that organization does not foster\r\nindividual freedom; that, on the contrary, it means the decay of\r\nindividuality.  In reality, however, the true function of\r\norganization is to aid the development and growth of personality.\r\n\r\n\"Just as the animal cells, by mutual co-operation, express their\r\nlatent powers in formation of the complete organism, so does the\r\nindividual, by co-operative effort with other individuals, attain his\r\nhighest form of development.\r\n\r\n\"An organization, in the true sense, cannot result from the\r\ncombination of mere nonentities.  It must be composed of\r\nself-conscious, intelligent individualities.  Indeed, the total of\r\nthe possibilities and activities of an organization is represented in\r\nthe expression of individual energies.\r\n\r\n\"It therefore logically follows that the greater the number of\r\nstrong, self-conscious personalities in an organization, the less\r\ndanger of stagnation, and the more intense its life element.\r\n\r\n\"Anarchism asserts the possibility of an organization without\r\ndiscipline, fear, or punishment, and without the pressure of poverty:\r\na new social organism which will make an end to the terrible struggle\r\nfor the means of existence,--the savage struggle which undermines the\r\nfinest qualities in man, and ever widens the social abyss.  In short,\r\nAnarchism strives towards a social organization which will establish\r\nwell-being for all.\r\n\r\n\"The germ of such an organization can be found in that form of trades\r\nunionism which has done away with centralization, bureaucracy, and\r\ndiscipline, and which favors independent and direct action on the\r\npart of its members.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe very considerable progress of Anarchist ideas in America can best\r\nbe gauged by the remarkable success of the three extensive lecture\r\ntours of Emma Goldman since the Amsterdam Congress of 1907.  Each\r\ntour extended over new territory, including localities where\r\nAnarchism had never before received a hearing.  But the most\r\ngratifying aspect of her untiring efforts is the tremendous sale of\r\nAnarchist literature, whose propagandist effect cannot be estimated.\r\nIt was during one of these tours that a remarkable incident happened,\r\nstrikingly demonstrating the inspiring potentialities of the\r\nAnarchist idea.  In San Francisco, in 1908, Emma Goldman's lecture\r\nattracted a soldier of the United States Army, William Buwalda.  For\r\ndaring to attend an Anarchist meeting, the free Republic\r\ncourt-martialed Buwalda and imprisoned him for one year.  Thanks to\r\nthe regenerating power of the new philosophy, the government lost a\r\nsoldier, but the cause of liberty gained a man.\r\n\r\n\r\nA propagandist of Emma Goldman's importance is necessarily a sharp\r\nthorn to the reaction.  She is looked upon as a danger to the\r\ncontinued existence of authoritarian usurpation.  No wonder, then,\r\nthat the enemy resorts to any and all means to make her impossible.\r\nA systematic attempt to suppress her activities was organized a year\r\nago by the united police force of the country.  But like all previous\r\nsimilar attempts, it failed in a most brilliant manner.  Energetic\r\nprotests on the part of the intellectual element of America succeeded\r\nin overthrowing the dastardly conspiracy against free speech.\r\nAnother attempt to make Emma Goldman impossible was essayed by the\r\nFederal authorities at Washington.  In order to deprive her of the\r\nrights of citizenship, the government revoked the citizenship papers\r\nof her husband, whom she had married at the youthful age of eighteen,\r\nand whose whereabouts, if he be alive, could not be determined for\r\nthe last two decades.  The great government of the glorious United\r\nStates did not hesitate to stoop to the most despicable methods to\r\naccomplish that achievement.  But as her citizenship had never proved\r\nof use to Emma Goldman, she can bear the loss with a light heart.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are personalities who possess such a powerful individuality\r\nthat by its very force they exert the most potent influence over the\r\nbest representatives of their time.  Michael Bakunin was such a\r\npersonality.  But for him, Richard Wagner had never written DIE KUNST\r\nUND DIE REVOLUTION.  Emma Goldman is a similar personality.  She is a\r\nstrong factor in the socio-political life of America.  By virtue of\r\nher eloquence, energy, and brilliant mentality, she moulds the minds\r\nand hearts of thousands of her auditors.\r\n\r\nDeep sympathy and compassion for suffering humanity, and an\r\ninexorable honesty toward herself, are the leading traits of Emma\r\nGoldman.  No person, whether friend or foe, shall presume to control\r\nher goal or dictate her mode of life.  She would perish rather than\r\nsacrifice her convictions, or the right of self-ownership of soul and\r\nbody.  Respectability could easily forgive the teaching of theoretic\r\nAnarchism; but Emma Goldman does not merely preach the new\r\nphilosophy; she also persists in living it,--and that is the one\r\nsupreme, unforgivable crime.  Were she, like so many radicals, to\r\nconsider her ideal as merely an intellectual ornament; were she to\r\nmake concessions to existing society and compromise with old\r\nprejudices,--then even the most radical views could be pardoned in\r\nher.  But that she takes her radicalism seriously; that it has\r\npermeated her blood and marrow to the extent where she not merely\r\nteaches but also practices her convictions--this shocks even the\r\nradical Mrs. Grundy.  Emma Goldman lives her own life; she associates\r\nwith publicans--hence the indignation of the Pharisees and Sadducees.\r\n\r\nIt is no mere coincidence that such divergent writers as Pietro Gori\r\nand William Marion Reedy find similar traits in their\r\ncharacterization of Emma Goldman.  In a contribution to LA QUESTIONE\r\nSOCIALE, Pietro Gori calls her a \"moral power, a woman who, with the\r\nvision of a sibyl, prophesies the coming of a new kingdom for the\r\noppressed; a woman who, with logic and deep earnestness, analyses the\r\nills of society, and portrays, with artist touch, the coming dawn of\r\nhumanity, founded on equality, brotherhood, and liberty.\"\r\n\r\nWilliam Reedy sees in Emma Goldman the \"daughter of the dream, her\r\ngospel a vision which is the vision of every truly great-souled man\r\nand woman who has ever lived.\"\r\n\r\nCowards who fear the consequences of their deeds have coined the word\r\nof philosophic Anarchism.  Emma Goldman is too sincere, too defiant,\r\nto seek safety behind such paltry pleas.  She is an Anarchist, pure\r\nand simple.  She represents the idea of Anarchism as framed by Josiah\r\nWarrn, Proudhon, Bakunin, Kropotkin, Tolstoy.  Yet she also\r\nunderstands the psychologic causes which induce a Caserio, a\r\nVaillant, a Bresci, a Berkman, or a Czolgosz to commit deeds of\r\nviolence.  To the soldier in the social struggle it is a point of\r\nhonor to come in conflict with the powers of darkness and tyranny,\r\nand Emma Goldman is proud to count among her best friends and\r\ncomrades men and women who bear the wounds and scars received in\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\nIn the words of Voltairine de Cleyre, characterizing Emma Goldman\r\nafter the latter's imprisonment in 1893: The spirit that animates\r\nEmma Goldman is the only one which will emancipate the slave from his\r\nslavery, the tyrant from his tyranny--the spirit which is willing to\r\ndare and suffer.\r\n\r\nHIPPOLYTE HAVEL.\r\n\r\nNew York, December, 1910.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nSome twenty-one years ago I heard the first great Anarchist\r\nspeaker--the inimitable John Most.  It seemed to me then, and for\r\nmany years after, that the spoken word hurled forth among the masses\r\nwith such wonderful eloquence, such enthusiasm and fire, could never\r\nbe erased from the human mind and soul.  How could any one of all the\r\nmultitudes who flocked to Most's meetings escape his prophetic voice!\r\nSurely they had but to hear him to throw off their old beliefs, and\r\nsee the truth and beauty of Anarchism!\r\n\r\nMy one great longing then was to be able to speak with the tongue of\r\nJohn Most,--that I, too, might thus reach the masses.  Oh, for the\r\nnaivety of Youth's enthusiasm!  It is the time when the hardest thing\r\nseems but child's play.  It is the only period in life worth while.\r\nAlas!  This period is but of short duration.  Like Spring, the STURM\r\nUND DRANG period of the propagandist brings forth growth, frail and\r\ndelicate, to be matured or killed according to its powers of\r\nresistance against a thousand vicissitudes.\r\n\r\nMy great faith in the wonder worker, the spoken word, is no more.  I\r\nhave realized its inadequacy to awaken thought, or even emotion.\r\nGradually, and with no small struggle against this realization, I\r\ncame to see that oral propaganda is at best but a means of shaking\r\npeople from their lethargy: it leaves no lasting impression.  The\r\nvery fact that most people attend meetings only if aroused by\r\nnewspaper sensations, or because they expect to be amused, is proof\r\nthat they really have no inner urge to learn.\r\n\r\nIt is altogether different with the written mode of human expression.\r\nNo one, unless intensely interested in progressive ideas, will bother\r\nwith serious books.  That leads me to another discovery made after\r\nmany years of public activity.  It is this: All claims of education\r\nnotwithstanding, the pupil will accept only that which his mind\r\ncraves.  Already this truth is recognized by most modern educators in\r\nrelation to the immature mind.  I think it is equally true regarding\r\nthe adult.  Anarchists or revolutionists can no more be made than\r\nmusicians.  All that can be done is to plant the seeds of thought.\r\nWhether something vital will develop depends largely on the fertility\r\nof the human soil, though the quality of the intellectual seed must\r\nnot be overlooked.\r\n\r\nIn meetings the audience is distracted by a thousand non-essentials.\r\nThe speaker, though ever so eloquent, cannot escape the restlessness\r\nof the crowd, with the inevitable result that he will fail to strike\r\nroot.  In all probability he will not even do justice to himself.\r\n\r\nThe relation between the writer and the reader is more intimate.\r\nTrue, books are only what we want them to be; rather, what we read\r\ninto them.  That we can do so demonstrates the importance of written\r\nas against oral expression.  It is this certainty which has induced\r\nme to gather in one volume my ideas on various topics of individual\r\nand social importance.  They represent the mental and soul struggles\r\nof twenty-one years,--the conclusions derived after many changes and\r\ninner revisions.\r\n\r\nI am not sanguine enough to hope that my readers will be as numerous\r\nas those who have heard me.  But I prefer to reach the few who really\r\nwant to learn, rather than the many who come to be amused.\r\n\r\nAs to the book, it must speak for itself.  Explanatory remarks do but\r\ndetract from the ideas set forth.  However, I wish to forestall two\r\nobjections which will undoubtedly be raised.  One is in reference to\r\nthe essay on ANARCHISM; the other, on MINORITIES VERSUS MAJORITIES.\r\n\r\n\"Why do you not say how things will be operated under Anarchism?\" is\r\na question I have had to meet thousands of times.  Because I believe\r\nthat Anarchism can not consistently impose an iron-clad program or\r\nmethod on the future.  The things every new generation has to fight,\r\nand which it can least overcome, are the burdens of the past, which\r\nholds us all as in a net.  Anarchism, at least as I understand it,\r\nleaves posterity free to develop its own particular systems, in\r\nharmony with its needs.  Our most vivid imagination can not foresee\r\nthe potentialities of a race set free from external restraints.\r\nHow, then, can any one assume to map out a line of conduct for those\r\nto come?  We, who pay dearly for every breath of pure, fresh air,\r\nmust guard against the tendency to fetter the future.  If we succeed\r\nin clearing the soil from the rubbish of the past and present, we\r\nwill leave to posterity the greatest and safest heritage of all ages.\r\n\r\nThe most disheartening tendency common among readers is to tear out\r\none sentence from a work, as a criterion of the writer's ideas or\r\npersonality.  Friedrich Nietzsche, for instance, is decried as a\r\nhater of the weak because he believed in the UEBERMENSCH.  It does\r\nnot occur to the shallow interpreters of that giant mind that this\r\nvision of the UEBERMENSCH also called for a state of society which\r\nwill not give birth to a race of weaklings and slaves.\r\n\r\nIt is the same narrow attitude which sees in Max Stirner naught but\r\nthe apostle of the theory \"each for himself, the devil take the hind\r\none.\"  That Stirner's individualism contains the greatest social\r\npossibilities is utterly ignored.  Yet, it is nevertheless true that\r\nif society is ever to become free, it will be so through liberated\r\nindividuals, whose free efforts make society.\r\n\r\nThese examples bring me to the objection that will be raised to\r\nMINORITIES VERSUS MAJORITIES.  No doubt, I shall be excommunicated as\r\nan enemy of the people, because I repudiate the mass as a creative\r\nfactor.  I shall prefer that rather than be guilty of the demagogic\r\nplatitudes so commonly in vogue as a bait for the people.  I realize\r\nthe malady of the oppressed and disinherited masses only too well,\r\nbut I refuse to prescribe the usual ridiculous palliatives which\r\nallow the patient neither to die nor to recover.  One cannot be too\r\nextreme in dealing with social ills; besides, the extreme thing is\r\ngenerally the true thing.  My lack of faith in the majority is\r\ndictated by my faith in the potentialities of the individual.  Only\r\nwhen the latter becomes free to choose his associates for a common\r\npurpose, can we hope for order and harmony out of this world of chaos\r\nand inequality.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, my book must speak for itself.\r\n\r\nEmma Goldman\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANARCHISM: WHAT IT REALLY STANDS FOR\r\n\r\n\r\n                           ANARCHY.\r\n\r\n          Ever reviled, accursed, ne'er understood,\r\n            Thou art the grisly terror of our age.\r\n          \"Wreck of all order,\" cry the multitude,\r\n            \"Art thou, and war and murder's endless rage.\"\r\n          O, let them cry. To them that ne'er have striven\r\n            The truth that lies behind a word to find,\r\n          To them the word's right meaning was not given.\r\n            They shall continue blind among the blind.\r\n          But thou, O word, so clear, so strong, so pure,\r\n            Thou sayest all which I for goal have taken.\r\n          I give thee to the future! Thine secure\r\n            When each at least unto himself shall waken.\r\n          Comes it in sunshine? In the tempest's thrill?\r\n            I cannot tell--but it the earth shall see!\r\n          I am an Anarchist! Wherefore I will\r\n            Not rule, and also ruled I will not be!\r\n                                        JOHN HENRY MACKAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of human growth and development is at the same time the\r\nhistory of the terrible struggle of every new idea heralding the\r\napproach of a brighter dawn.  In its tenacious hold on tradition, the\r\nOld has never hesitated to make use of the foulest and cruelest means\r\nto stay the advent of the New, in whatever form or period the latter\r\nmay have asserted itself.  Nor need we retrace our steps into the\r\ndistant past to realize the enormity of opposition, difficulties, and\r\nhardships placed in the path of every progressive idea.  The rack,\r\nthe thumbscrew, and the knout are still with us; so are the convict's\r\ngarb and the social wrath, all conspiring against the spirit that is\r\nserenely marching on.\r\n\r\nAnarchism could not hope to escape the fate of all other ideas of\r\ninnovation.  Indeed, as the most revolutionary and uncompromising\r\ninnovator, Anarchism must needs meet with the combined ignorance and\r\nvenom of the world it aims to reconstruct.\r\n\r\nTo deal even remotely with all that is being said and done against\r\nAnarchism would necessitate the writing of a whole volume.  I shall\r\ntherefore meet only two of the principal objections.  In so doing, I\r\nshall attempt to elucidate what Anarchism really stands for.\r\n\r\nThe strange phenomenon of the opposition to Anarchism is that it\r\nbrings to light the relation between so-called intelligence and\r\nignorance.  And yet this is not so very strange when we consider the\r\nrelativity of all things.  The ignorant mass has in its favor that it\r\nmakes no pretense of knowledge or tolerance.  Acting, as it always\r\ndoes, by mere impulse, its reasons are like those of a child.\r\n\"Why?\"  \"Because.\"  Yet the opposition of the uneducated to Anarchism\r\ndeserves the same consideration as that of the intelligent man.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, are the objections?  First, Anarchism is impractical,\r\nthough a beautiful ideal.  Second, Anarchism stands for violence and\r\ndestruction, hence it must be repudiated as vile and dangerous.\r\nBoth the intelligent man and the ignorant mass judge not from a\r\nthorough knowledge of the subject, but either from hearsay or false\r\ninterpretation.\r\n\r\nA practical scheme, says Oscar Wilde, is either one already in\r\nexistence, or a scheme that could be carried out under the existing\r\nconditions; but it is exactly the existing conditions that one\r\nobjects to, and any scheme that could accept these conditions is\r\nwrong and foolish.  The true criterion of the practical, therefore,\r\nis not whether the latter can keep intact the wrong or foolish;\r\nrather is it whether the scheme has vitality enough to leave the\r\nstagnant waters of the old, and build, as well as sustain, new life.\r\nIn the light of this conception, Anarchism is indeed practical.\r\nMore than any other idea, it is helping to do away with the wrong and\r\nfoolish; more than any other idea, it is building and sustaining new\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThe emotions of the ignorant man are continuously kept at a pitch by\r\nthe most blood-curdling stories about Anarchism.  Not a thing too\r\noutrageous to be employed against this philosophy and its exponents.\r\nTherefore Anarchism represents to the unthinking what the proverbial\r\nbad man does to the child,--a black monster bent on swallowing\r\neverything; in short, destruction and violence.\r\n\r\nDestruction and violence!  How is the ordinary man to know that the\r\nmost violent element in society is ignorance; that its power of\r\ndestruction is the very thing Anarchism is combating?  Nor is he\r\naware that Anarchism, whose roots, as it were, are part of nature's\r\nforces, destroys, not healthful tissue, but parasitic growths that\r\nfeed on the life's essence of society.  It is merely clearing the\r\nsoil from weeds and sagebrush, that it may eventually bear healthy\r\nfruit.\r\n\r\nSomeone has said that it requires less mental effort to condemn than\r\nto think.  The widespread mental indolence, so prevalent in society,\r\nproves this to be only too true.  Rather than to go to the bottom of\r\nany given idea, to examine into its origin and meaning, most people\r\nwill either condemn it altogether, or rely on some superficial or\r\nprejudicial definition of non-essentials.\r\n\r\nAnarchism urges man to think, to investigate, to analyze every\r\nproposition; but that the brain capacity of the average reader be not\r\ntaxed too much, I also shall begin with a definition, and then\r\nelaborate on the latter.\r\n\r\n     ANARCHISM:--The philosophy of a new social order based on\r\n       liberty unrestricted by man-made law; the theory that all\r\n       forms of government rest on violence, and are therefore wrong\r\n       and harmful, as well as unnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe new social order rests, of course, on the materialistic basis of\r\nlife; but while all Anarchists agree that the main evil today is an\r\neconomic one, they maintain that the solution of that evil can be\r\nbrought about only through the consideration of EVERY PHASE of\r\nlife,--individual, as well as the collective; the internal, as well\r\nas the external phases.\r\n\r\nA thorough perusal of the history of human development will disclose\r\ntwo elements in bitter conflict with each other; elements that are\r\nonly now beginning to be understood, not as foreign to each other,\r\nbut as closely related and truly harmonious, if only placed in proper\r\nenvironment: the individual and social instincts.  The individual and\r\nsociety have waged a relentless and bloody battle for ages, each\r\nstriving for supremacy, because each was blind to the value and\r\nimportance of the other.  The individual and social instincts,--the\r\none a most potent factor for individual endeavor, for growth,\r\naspiration, self-realization; the other an equally potent factor for\r\nmutual helpfulness and social well-being.\r\n\r\nThe explanation of the storm raging within the individual, and\r\nbetween him and his surroundings, is not far to seek.  The primitive\r\nman, unable to understand his being, much less the unity of all life,\r\nfelt himself absolutely dependent on blind, hidden forces ever ready\r\nto mock and taunt him.  Out of that attitude grew the religious\r\nconcepts of man as a mere speck of dust dependent on superior powers\r\non high, who can only be appeased by complete surrender.  All the\r\nearly sagas rest on that idea, which continues to be the LEIT-MOTIF\r\nof the biblical tales dealing with the relation of man to God, to the\r\nState, to society.  Again and again the same motif, MAN IS NOTHING,\r\nTHE POWERS ARE EVERYTHING.  Thus Jehovah would only endure man on\r\ncondition of complete surrender.  Man can have all the glories of the\r\nearth, but he must not become conscious of himself.  The State,\r\nsociety, and moral laws all sing the same refrain: Man can have all\r\nthe glories of the earth, but he must not become conscious of\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nAnarchism is the only philosophy which brings to man the\r\nconsciousness of himself; which maintains that God, the State, and\r\nsociety are non-existent, that their promises are null and void,\r\nsince they can be fulfilled only through man's subordination.\r\nAnarchism is therefore the teacher of the unity of life; not merely\r\nin nature, but in man.  There is no conflict between the individual\r\nand the social instincts, any more than there is between the heart\r\nand the lungs: the one the receptacle of a precious life essence, the\r\nother the repository of the element that keeps the essence pure and\r\nstrong.  The individual is the heart of society, conserving the\r\nessence of social life; society is the lungs which are distributing\r\nthe element to keep the life essence--that is, the individual--pure\r\nand strong.\r\n\r\n\"The one thing of value in the world,\" says Emerson, \"is the active\r\nsoul; this every man contains within him.  The soul active sees\r\nabsolute truth and utters truth and creates.\"  In other words, the\r\nindividual instinct is the thing of value in the world.  It is the\r\ntrue soul that sees and creates the truth alive, out of which is to\r\ncome a still greater truth, the re-born social soul.\r\n\r\nAnarchism is the great liberator of man from the phantoms that have\r\nheld him captive; it is the arbiter and pacifier of the two forces\r\nfor individual and social harmony.  To accomplish that unity,\r\nAnarchism has declared war on the pernicious influences which have so\r\nfar prevented the harmonious blending of individual and social\r\ninstincts, the individual and society.\r\n\r\nReligion, the dominion of the human mind; Property, the dominion of\r\nhuman needs; and Government, the dominion of human conduct, represent\r\nthe stronghold of man's enslavement and all the horrors it entails.\r\nReligion! How it dominates man's mind, how it humiliates and degrades\r\nhis soul.  God is everything, man is nothing, says religion.  But out\r\nof that nothing God has created a kingdom so despotic, so tyrannical,\r\nso cruel, so terribly exacting that naught but gloom and tears and\r\nblood have ruled the world since gods began.  Anarchism rouses man to\r\nrebellion against this black monster.  Break your mental fetters, says\r\nAnarchism to man, for not until you think and judge for yourself will\r\nyou get rid of the dominion of darkness, the greatest obstacle to all\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nProperty, the dominion of man's needs, the denial of the right to\r\nsatisfy his needs.  Time was when property claimed a divine right,\r\nwhen it came to man with the same refrain, even as religion,\r\n\"Sacrifice! Abnegate! Submit!\"  The spirit of Anarchism has lifted\r\nman from his prostrate position.  He now stands erect, with his face\r\ntoward the light.  He has learned to see the insatiable, devouring,\r\ndevastating nature of property, and he is preparing to strike the\r\nmonster dead.\r\n\r\n\"Property is robbery,\" said the great French Anarchist, Proudhon.\r\nYes, but without risk and danger to the robber.  Monopolizing the\r\naccumulated efforts of man, property has robbed him of his\r\nbirthright, and has turned him loose a pauper and an outcast.\r\nProperty has not even the time-worn excuse that man does not create\r\nenough to satisfy all needs.  The A B C student of economics knows\r\nthat the productivity of labor within the last few decades far\r\nexceeds normal demand a hundredfold.  But what are normal demands to\r\nan abnormal institution?  The only demand that property recognizes is\r\nits own gluttonous appetite for greater wealth, because wealth means\r\npower; the power to subdue, to crush, to exploit, the power to\r\nenslave, to outrage, to degrade.  America is particularly boastful of\r\nher great power, her enormous national wealth.  Poor America, of what\r\navail is all her wealth, if the individuals comprising the nation are\r\nwretchedly poor?  If they live in squalor, in filth, in crime, with\r\nhope and joy gone, a homeless, soilless army of human prey.\r\n\r\nIt is generally conceded that unless the returns of any business\r\nventure exceed the cost, bankruptcy is inevitable.  But those engaged\r\nin the business of producing wealth have not yet learned even this\r\nsimple lesson.  Every year the cost of production in human life is\r\ngrowing larger (50,000 killed, 100,000 wounded in America last year);\r\nthe returns to the masses, who help to create wealth, are ever\r\ngetting smaller.  Yet America continues to be blind to the inevitable\r\nbankruptcy of our business of production.  Nor is this the only crime\r\nof the latter.  Still more fatal is the crime of turning the producer\r\ninto a mere particle of a machine, with less will and decision than\r\nhis master of steel and iron.  Man is being robbed not merely of the\r\nproducts of his labor, but of the power of free initiative, of\r\noriginality, and the interest in, or desire for, the things he is\r\nmaking.\r\n\r\nReal wealth consists in things of utility and beauty, in things that\r\nhelp to create strong, beautiful bodies and surroundings inspiring to\r\nlive in.  But if man is doomed to wind cotton around a spool, or dig\r\ncoal, or build roads for thirty years of his life, there can be no\r\ntalk of wealth.  What he gives to the world is only gray and hideous\r\nthings, reflecting a dull and hideous existence,--too weak to live,\r\ntoo cowardly to die.  Strange to say, there are people who extol this\r\ndeadening method of centralized production as the proudest\r\nachievement of our age.  They fail utterly to realize that if we are\r\nto continue in machine subserviency, our slavery is more complete\r\nthan was our bondage to the King.  They do not want to know that\r\ncentralization is not only the death-knell of liberty, but also of\r\nhealth and beauty, of art and science, all these being impossible in\r\na clock-like, mechanical atmosphere.\r\n\r\nAnarchism cannot but repudiate such a method of production: its goal\r\nis the freest possible expression of all the latent powers of the\r\nindividual.  Oscar Wilde defines a perfect personality as \"one who\r\ndevelops under perfect conditions, who is not wounded, maimed, or in\r\ndanger.\"  A perfect personality, then, is only possible in a state of\r\nsociety where man is free to choose the mode of work, the conditions\r\nof work, and the freedom to work.  One to whom the making of a table,\r\nthe building of a house, or the tilling of the soil, is what the\r\npainting is to the artist and the discovery to the scientist,--the\r\nresult of inspiration, of intense longing, and deep interest in work\r\nas a creative force.  That being the ideal of Anarchism, its economic\r\narrangements must consist of voluntary productive and distributive\r\nassociations, gradually developing into free communism, as the best\r\nmeans of producing with the least waste of human energy.  Anarchism,\r\nhowever, also recognizes the right of the individual, or numbers of\r\nindividuals, to arrange at all times for other forms of work, in\r\nharmony with their tastes and desires.\r\n\r\nSuch free display of human energy being possible only under complete\r\nindividual and social freedom, Anarchism directs its forces against\r\nthe third and greatest foe of all social equality; namely, the State,\r\norganized authority, or statutory law,--the dominion of human\r\nconduct.\r\n\r\nJust as religion has fettered the human mind, and as property, or the\r\nmonopoly of things, has subdued and stifled man's needs, so has the\r\nState enslaved his spirit, dictating every phase of conduct.  \"All\r\ngovernment in essence,\" says Emerson, \"is tyranny.\"  It matters not\r\nwhether it is government by divine right or majority rule.  In every\r\ninstance its aim is the absolute subordination of the individual.\r\n\r\nReferring to the American government, the greatest American\r\nAnarchist, David Thoreau, said: \"Government, what is it but a\r\ntradition, though a recent one, endeavoring to transmit itself\r\nunimpaired to posterity, but each instance losing its integrity; it\r\nhas not the vitality and force of a single living man.  Law never\r\nmade man a whit more just; and by means of their respect for it, even\r\nthe well disposed are daily made agents of injustice.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, the keynote of government is injustice.  With the arrogance\r\nand self-sufficiency of the King who could do no wrong, governments\r\nordain, judge, condemn, and punish the most insignificant offenses,\r\nwhile maintaining themselves by the greatest of all offenses, the\r\nannihilation of individual liberty.  Thus Ouida is right when she\r\nmaintains that \"the State only aims at instilling those qualities in\r\nits public by which its demands are obeyed, and its exchequer is\r\nfilled.  Its highest attainment is the reduction of mankind to\r\nclockwork.  In its atmosphere all those finer and more delicate\r\nliberties, which require treatment and spacious expansion, inevitably\r\ndry up and perish.  The State requires a taxpaying machine in which\r\nthere is no hitch, an exchequer in which there is never a deficit,\r\nand a public, monotonous, obedient, colorless, spiritless, moving\r\nhumbly like a flock of sheep along a straight high road between two\r\nwalls.\"\r\n\r\nYet even a flock of sheep would resist the chicanery of the State, if\r\nit were not for the corruptive, tyrannical, and oppressive methods it\r\nemploys to serve its purposes.  Therefore Bakunin repudiates the\r\nState as synonymous with the surrender of the liberty of the\r\nindividual or small minorities,--the destruction of social\r\nrelationship, the curtailment, or complete denial even, of life\r\nitself, for its own aggrandizement.  The State is the altar of\r\npolitical freedom and, like the religious altar, it is maintained for\r\nthe purpose of human sacrifice.\r\n\r\nIn fact, there is hardly a modern thinker who does not agree that\r\ngovernment, organized authority, or the State, is necessary ONLY to\r\nmaintain or protect property and monopoly.  It has proven efficient\r\nin that function only.\r\n\r\nEven George Bernard Shaw, who hopes for the miraculous from the State\r\nunder Fabianism, nevertheless admits that \"it is at present a huge\r\nmachine for robbing and slave-driving of the poor by brute force.\"\r\nThis being the case, it is hard to see why the clever prefacer wishes\r\nto uphold the State after poverty shall have ceased to exist.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately there are still a number of people who continue in the\r\nfatal belief that government rests on natural laws, that it maintains\r\nsocial order and harmony, that it diminishes crime, and that it\r\nprevents the lazy man from fleecing his fellows.  I shall therefore\r\nexamine these contentions.\r\n\r\nA natural law is that factor in man which asserts itself freely and\r\nspontaneously without any external force, in harmony with the\r\nrequirements of nature.  For instance, the demand for nutrition, for\r\nsex gratification, for light, air, and exercise, is a natural law.\r\nBut its expression needs not the machinery of government, needs not\r\nthe club, the gun, the handcuff, or the prison.  To obey such laws,\r\nif we may call it obedience, requires only spontaneity and free\r\nopportunity.  That governments do not maintain themselves through\r\nsuch harmonious factors is proven by the terrible array of violence,\r\nforce, and coercion all governments use in order to live.  Thus\r\nBlackstone is right when he says, \"Human laws are invalid, because\r\nthey are contrary to the laws of nature.\"\r\n\r\nUnless it be the order of Warsaw after the slaughter of thousands of\r\npeople, it is difficult to ascribe to governments any capacity for\r\norder or social harmony.  Order derived through submission and\r\nmaintained by terror is not much of a safe guaranty; yet that is the\r\nonly \"order\" that governments have ever maintained.  True social\r\nharmony grows naturally out of solidarity of interests.  In a society\r\nwhere those who always work never have anything, while those who\r\nnever work enjoy everything, solidarity of interests is non-existent;\r\nhence social harmony is but a myth.  The only way organized authority\r\nmeets this grave situation is by extending still greater privileges\r\nto those who have already monopolized the earth, and by still further\r\nenslaving the disinherited masses.  Thus the entire arsenal of\r\ngovernment--laws, police, soldiers, the courts, legislatures,\r\nprisons,--is strenuously engaged in \"harmonizing\" the most\r\nantagonistic elements in society.\r\n\r\nThe most absurd apology for authority and law is that they serve to\r\ndiminish crime.  Aside from the fact that the State is itself the\r\ngreatest criminal, breaking every written and natural law, stealing\r\nin the form of taxes, killing in the form of war and capital\r\npunishment, it has come to an absolute standstill in coping with\r\ncrime.  It has failed utterly to destroy or even minimize the\r\nhorrible scourge of its own creation.\r\n\r\nCrime is naught but misdirected energy.  So long as every institution\r\nof today, economic, political, social, and moral, conspires to\r\nmisdirect human energy into wrong channels; so long as most people\r\nare out of place doing the things they hate to do, living a life they\r\nloathe to live, crime will be inevitable, and all the laws on the\r\nstatutes can only increase, but never do away with, crime.  What does\r\nsociety, as it exists today, know of the process of despair, the\r\npoverty, the horrors, the fearful struggle the human soul must pass\r\non its way to crime and degradation.  Who that knows this terrible\r\nprocess can fail to see the truth in these words of Peter Kropotkin:\r\n\r\n\"Those who will hold the balance between the benefits thus attributed\r\nto law and punishment and the degrading effect of the latter on\r\nhumanity; those who will estimate the torrent of depravity poured\r\nabroad in human society by the informer, favored by the Judge even,\r\nand paid for in clinking cash by governments, under the pretext of\r\naiding to unmask crime; those who will go within prison walls and\r\nthere see what human beings become when deprived of liberty, when\r\nsubjected to the care of brutal keepers, to coarse, cruel words, to a\r\nthousand stinging, piercing humiliations, will agree with us that the\r\nentire apparatus of prison and punishment is an abomination which\r\nought to be brought to an end.\"\r\n\r\nThe deterrent influence of law on the lazy man is too absurd to merit\r\nconsideration.  If society were only relieved of the waste and\r\nexpense of keeping a lazy class, and the equally great expense of the\r\nparaphernalia of protection this lazy class requires, the social\r\ntables would contain an abundance for all, including even the\r\noccasional lazy individual.  Besides, it is well to consider that\r\nlaziness results either from special privileges, or physical and\r\nmental abnormalities.  Our present insane system of production\r\nfosters both, and the most astounding phenomenon is that people\r\nshould want to work at all now.  Anarchism aims to strip labor of its\r\ndeadening, dulling aspect, of its gloom and compulsion.  It aims to\r\nmake work an instrument of joy, of strength, of color, of real\r\nharmony, so that the poorest sort of a man should find in work both\r\nrecreation and hope.\r\n\r\nTo achieve such an arrangement of life, government, with its unjust,\r\narbitrary, repressive measures, must be done away with.  At best it\r\nhas but imposed one single mode of life upon all, without regard to\r\nindividual and social variations and needs.  In destroying government\r\nand statutory laws, Anarchism proposes to rescue the self-respect and\r\nindependence of the individual from all restraint and invasion by\r\nauthority.  Only in freedom can man grow to his full stature.  Only\r\nin freedom will he learn to think and move, and give the very best in\r\nhim.  Only in freedom will he realize the true force of the social\r\nbonds which knit men together, and which are the true foundation of a\r\nnormal social life.\r\n\r\nBut what about human nature?  Can it be changed?  And if not, will it\r\nendure under Anarchism?\r\n\r\nPoor human nature, what horrible crimes have been committed in thy\r\nname!  Every fool, from king to policeman, from the flatheaded parson\r\nto the visionless dabbler in science, presumes to speak\r\nauthoritatively of human nature.  The greater the mental charlatan,\r\nthe more definite his insistence on the wickedness and weaknesses of\r\nhuman nature.  Yet, how can any one speak of it today, with every\r\nsoul in a prison, with every heart fettered, wounded, and maimed?\r\n\r\nJohn Burroughs has stated that experimental study of animals in\r\ncaptivity is absolutely useless.  Their character, their habits,\r\ntheir appetites undergo a complete transformation when torn from\r\ntheir soil in field and forest.  With human nature caged in a narrow\r\nspace, whipped daily into submission, how can we speak of its\r\npotentialities?\r\n\r\nFreedom, expansion, opportunity, and, above all, peace and repose,\r\nalone can teach us the real dominant factors of human nature and all\r\nits wonderful possibilities.\r\n\r\nAnarchism, then, really stands for the liberation of the human mind\r\nfrom the dominion of religion; the liberation of the human body from\r\nthe dominion of property; liberation from the shackles and restraint\r\nof government.  Anarchism stands for a social order based on the free\r\ngrouping of individuals for the purpose of producing real social\r\nwealth; an order that will guarantee to every human being free access\r\nto the earth and full enjoyment of the necessities of life, according\r\nto individual desires, tastes, and inclinations.\r\n\r\nThis is not a wild fancy or an aberration of the mind.  It is the\r\nconclusion arrived at by hosts of intellectual men and women the\r\nworld over; a conclusion resulting from the close and studious\r\nobservation of the tendencies of modern society: individual liberty\r\nand economic equality, the twin forces for the birth of what is fine\r\nand true in man.\r\n\r\nAs to methods.  Anarchism is not, as some may suppose, a theory of\r\nthe future to be realized through divine inspiration.  It is a living\r\nforce in the affairs of our life, constantly creating new conditions.\r\nThe methods of Anarchism therefore do not comprise an iron-clad\r\nprogram to be carried out under all circumstances.  Methods must grow\r\nout of the economic needs of each place and clime, and of the\r\nintellectual and temperamental requirements of the individual.  The\r\nserene, calm character of a Tolstoy will wish different methods for\r\nsocial reconstruction than the intense, overflowing personality of a\r\nMichael Bakunin or a Peter Kropotkin.  Equally so it must be apparent\r\nthat the economic and political needs of Russia will dictate more\r\ndrastic measures than would England or America.  Anarchism does not\r\nstand for military drill and uniformity; it does, however, stand for\r\nthe spirit of revolt, in whatever form, against everything that\r\nhinders human growth.  All Anarchists agree in that, as they also\r\nagree in their opposition to the political machinery as a means of\r\nbringing about the great social change.\r\n\r\n\"All voting,\" says Thoreau, \"is a sort of gaming, like checkers, or\r\nbackgammon, a playing with right and wrong; its obligation never\r\nexceeds that of expediency.  Even voting for the right thing is doing\r\nnothing for it.  A wise man will not leave the right to the mercy of\r\nchance, nor wish it to prevail through the power of the majority.\"\r\nA close examination of the machinery of politics and its achievements\r\nwill bear out the logic of Thoreau.\r\n\r\nWhat does the history of parliamentarism show?  Nothing but failure\r\nand defeat, not even a single reform to ameliorate the economic and\r\nsocial stress of the people.  Laws have been passed and enactments\r\nmade for the improvement and protection of labor.  Thus it was proven\r\nonly last year that Illinois, with the most rigid laws for mine\r\nprotection, had the greatest mine disasters.  In States where child\r\nlabor laws prevail, child exploitation is at its highest, and though\r\nwith us the workers enjoy full political opportunities, capitalism\r\nhas reached the most brazen zenith.\r\n\r\nEven were the workers able to have their own representatives, for\r\nwhich our good Socialist politicians are clamoring, what chances are\r\nthere for their honesty and good faith?  One has but to bear in mind\r\nthe process of politics to realize that its path of good intentions\r\nis full of pitfalls: wire-pulling, intriguing, flattering, lying,\r\ncheating; in fact, chicanery of every description, whereby the\r\npolitical aspirant can achieve success.  Added to that is a complete\r\ndemoralization of character and conviction, until nothing is left\r\nthat would make one hope for anything from such a human derelict.\r\nTime and time again the people were foolish enough to trust, believe,\r\nand support with their last farthing aspiring politicians, only to\r\nfind themselves betrayed and cheated.\r\n\r\nIt may be claimed that men of integrity would not become corrupt in\r\nthe political grinding mill.  Perhaps not; but such men would be\r\nabsolutely helpless to exert the slightest influence in behalf of\r\nlabor, as indeed has been shown in numerous instances.  The State is\r\nthe economic master of its servants.  Good men, if such there be,\r\nwould either remain true to their political faith and lose their\r\neconomic support, or they would cling to their economic master and be\r\nutterly unable to do the slightest good.  The political arena leaves\r\none no alternative, one must either be a dunce or a rogue.\r\n\r\nThe political superstition is still holding sway over the hearts and\r\nminds of the masses, but the true lovers of liberty will have no more\r\nto do with it.  Instead, they believe with Stirner that man has as\r\nmuch liberty as he is willing to take.  Anarchism therefore stands\r\nfor direct action, the open defiance of, and resistance to, all laws\r\nand restrictions, economic, social, and moral.  But defiance and\r\nresistance are illegal.  Therein lies the salvation of man.\r\nEverything illegal necessitates integrity, self-reliance, and\r\ncourage.  In short, it calls for free, independent spirits, for \"men\r\nwho are men, and who have a bone in their backs which you cannot pass\r\nyour hand through.\"\r\n\r\nUniversal suffrage itself owes its existence to direct action.  If\r\nnot for the spirit of rebellion, of the defiance on the part of the\r\nAmerican revolutionary fathers, their posterity would still wear the\r\nKing's coat.  If not for the direct action of a John Brown and his\r\ncomrades, America would still trade in the flesh of the black man.\r\nTrue, the trade in white flesh is still going on; but that, too, will\r\nhave to be abolished by direct action.  Trade-unionism, the economic\r\narena of the modern gladiator, owes its existence to direct action.\r\nIt is but recently that law and government have attempted to crush\r\nthe trade-union movement, and condemned the exponents of man's right\r\nto organize to prison as conspirators.  Had they sought to assert\r\ntheir cause through begging, pleading, and compromise, trade-unionism\r\nwould today be a negligible quantity.  In France, in Spain, in Italy,\r\nin Russia, nay even in England (witness the growing rebellion of\r\nEnglish labor unions) direct, revolutionary, economic action has\r\nbecome so strong a force in the battle for industrial liberty as to\r\nmake the world realize the tremendous importance of labor's power.\r\nThe General Strike, the supreme expression of the economic\r\nconsciousness of the workers, was ridiculed in America but a short\r\ntime ago.  Today every great strike, in order to win, must realize\r\nthe importance of the solidaric general protest.\r\n\r\nDirect action, having proven effective along economic lines, is\r\nequally potent in the environment of the individual.  There a hundred\r\nforces encroach upon his being, and only persistent resistance to\r\nthem will finally set him free.  Direct action against the authority\r\nin the shop, direct action against the authority of the law, direct\r\naction against the invasive, meddlesome authority of our moral code,\r\nis the logical, consistent method of Anarchism.\r\n\r\nWill it not lead to a revolution?  Indeed, it will.  No real social\r\nchange has ever come about without a revolution.  People are either\r\nnot familiar with their history, or they have not yet learned that\r\nrevolution is but thought carried into action.\r\n\r\nAnarchism, the great leaven of thought, is today permeating every\r\nphase of human endeavor.  Science, art, literature, the drama, the\r\neffort for economic betterment, in fact every individual and social\r\nopposition to the existing disorder of things, is illumined by the\r\nspiritual light of Anarchism.  It is the philosophy of the\r\nsovereignty of the individual.  It is the theory of social harmony.\r\nIt is the great, surging, living truth that is reconstructing the\r\nworld, and that will usher in the Dawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMINORITIES VERSUS MAJORITIES\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I were to give a summary of the tendency of our times, I would\r\nsay, Quantity.  The multitude, the mass spirit, dominates everywhere,\r\ndestroying quality.  Our entire life--production, politics, and\r\neducation--rests on quantity, on numbers.  The worker who once took\r\npride in the thoroughness and quality of his work, has been replaced\r\nby brainless, incompetent automatons, who turn out enormous\r\nquantities of things, valueless to themselves, and generally\r\ninjurious to the rest of mankind.  Thus quantity, instead of adding\r\nto life's comforts and peace, has merely increased man's burden.\r\n\r\nIn politics, naught but quantity counts.  In proportion to its\r\nincrease, however, principles, ideals, justice, and uprightness are\r\ncompletely swamped by the array of numbers.  In the struggle for\r\nsupremacy the various political parties outdo each other in trickery,\r\ndeceit, cunning, and shady machinations, confident that the one who\r\nsucceeds is sure to be hailed by the majority as the victor.  That is\r\nthe only god,--Success.  As to what expense, what terrible cost to\r\ncharacter, is of no moment.  We have not far to go in search of proof\r\nto verify this sad fact.\r\n\r\nNever before did the corruption, the complete rottenness of our\r\ngovernment stand so thoroughly exposed; never before were the\r\nAmerican people brought face to face with the Judas nature of that\r\npolitical body, which has claimed for years to be absolutely beyond\r\nreproach, as the mainstay of our institutions, the true protector of\r\nthe rights and liberties of the people.\r\n\r\nYet when the crimes of that party became so brazen that even the\r\nblind could see them, it needed but to muster up its minions, and its\r\nsupremacy was assured.  Thus the very victims, duped, betrayed,\r\noutraged a hundred times, decided, not against, but in favor of the\r\nvictor.  Bewildered, the few asked how could the majority betray the\r\ntraditions of American liberty?  Where was its judgment, its\r\nreasoning capacity?  That is just it, the majority cannot reason; it\r\nhas no judgment.  Lacking utterly in originality and moral courage,\r\nthe majority has always placed its destiny in the hands of others.\r\nIncapable of standing responsibilities, it has followed its leaders\r\neven unto destruction.  Dr. Stockman was right: \"The most dangerous\r\nenemies of truth and justice in our midst are the compact majorities,\r\nthe damned compact majority.\"  Without ambition or initiative, the\r\ncompact mass hates nothing so much as innovation.  It has always\r\nopposed, condemned, and hounded the innovator, the pioneer of a new\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\nThe oft repeated slogan of our time is, among all politicians, the\r\nSocialists included, that ours is an era of individualism, of the\r\nminority.  Only those who do not probe beneath the surface might be\r\nled to entertain this view.  Have not the few accumulated the wealth\r\nof the world?  Are they not the masters, the absolute kings of the\r\nsituation?  Their success, however, is due not to individualism, but\r\nto the inertia, the cravenness, the utter submission of the mass.\r\nThe latter wants but to be dominated, to be led, to be coerced.  As\r\nto individualism, at no time in human history did it have less chance\r\nof expression, less opportunity to assert itself in a normal, healthy\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nThe individual educator imbued with honesty of purpose, the artist or\r\nwriter of original ideas, the independent scientist or explorer, the\r\nnon-compromising pioneers of social changes are daily pushed to the\r\nwall by men whose learning and creative ability have become decrepit\r\nwith age.\r\n\r\nEducators of Ferrer's type are nowhere tolerated, while the\r\ndietitians of predigested food, a la Professors Eliot and Butler, are\r\nthe successful perpetuators of an age of nonentities, of automatons.\r\nIn the literary and dramatic world, the Humphrey Wards and Clyde\r\nFitches are the idols of the mass, while but few know or appreciate\r\nthe beauty and genius of an Emerson, Thoreau, Whitman; an Ibsen, a\r\nHauptmann, a Butler Yeats, or a Stephen Phillips.  They are like\r\nsolitary stars, far beyond the horizon of the multitude.\r\n\r\nPublishers, theatrical managers, and critics ask not for the quality\r\ninherent in creative art, but will it meet with a good sale, will it\r\nsuit the palate of the people?  Alas, this palate is like a dumping\r\nground; it relishes anything that needs no mental mastication.  As a\r\nresult, the mediocre, the ordinary, the commonplace represents the\r\nchief literary output.\r\n\r\nNeed I say that in art we are confronted with the same sad facts?\r\nOne has but to inspect our parks and thoroughfares to realize the\r\nhideousness and vulgarity of the art manufacture.  Certainly, none\r\nbut a majority taste would tolerate such an outrage on art.  False in\r\nconception and barbarous in execution, the statuary that infests\r\nAmerican cities has as much relation to true art, as a totem to a\r\nMichael Angelo.  Yet that is the only art that succeeds.  The true\r\nartistic genius, who will not cater to accepted notions, who\r\nexercises originality, and strives to be true to life, leads an\r\nobscure and wretched existence.  His work may some day become the fad\r\nof the mob, but not until his heart's blood had been exhausted; not\r\nuntil the pathfinder has ceased to be, and a throng of an idealless\r\nand visionless mob has done to death the heritage of the master.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the artist of today cannot create because\r\nPrometheus-like he is bound to the rock of economic necessity.\r\nThis, however, is true of art in all ages.  Michael Angelo was\r\ndependent on his patron saint, no less than the sculptor or painter\r\nof today, except that the art connoisseurs of those days were far\r\naway from the madding crowd.  They felt honored to be permitted to\r\nworship at the shrine of the master.\r\n\r\nThe art protector of our time knows but one criterion, one\r\nvalue,--the dollar.  He is not concerned about the quality of any\r\ngreat work, but in the quantity of dollars his purchase implies.\r\nThus the financier in Mirbeau's LES AFFAIRES SONT LES AFFAIRES points\r\nto some blurred arrangement in colors, saying \"See how great it is;\r\nit cost 50,000 francs.\"  Just like our own parvenues.  The fabulous\r\nfigures paid for their great art discoveries must make up for the\r\npoverty of their taste.\r\n\r\nThe most unpardonable sin in society is independence of thought.\r\nThat this should be so terribly apparent in a country whose symbol is\r\ndemocracy, is very significant of the tremendous power of the\r\nmajority.\r\n\r\nWendell Phillips said fifty years ago: \"In our country of absolute\r\ndemocratic equality, public opinion is not only omnipotent, it is\r\nomnipresent.  There is no refuge from its tyranny, there is no hiding\r\nfrom its reach, and the result is that if you take the old Greek\r\nlantern and go about to seek among a hundred, you will not find a\r\nsingle American who has not, or who does not fancy at least he has,\r\nsomething to gain or lose in his ambition, his social life, or\r\nbusiness, from the good opinion and the votes of those around him.\r\nAnd the consequence is that instead of being a mass of individuals,\r\neach one fearlessly blurting out his own conviction, as a nation\r\ncompared to other nations we are a mass of cowards.  More than any\r\nother people we are afraid of each other.\"  Evidently we have not\r\nadvanced very far from the condition that confronted Wendell\r\nPhillips.\r\n\r\nToday, as then, public opinion is the omnipresent tyrant; today, as\r\nthen, the majority represents a mass of cowards, willing to accept\r\nhim who mirrors its own soul and mind poverty.  That accounts for the\r\nunprecedented rise of a man like Roosevelt.  He embodies the very\r\nworst element of mob psychology.  A politician, he knows that the\r\nmajority cares little for ideals or integrity.  What it craves is\r\ndisplay.  It matters not whether that be a dog show, a prize fight,\r\nthe lynching of a \"nigger,\" the rounding up of some petty offender,\r\nthe marriage exposition of an heiress, or the acrobatic stunts of an\r\nex-president.  The more hideous the mental contortions, the greater\r\nthe delight and bravos of the mass.  Thus, poor in ideals and vulgar\r\nof soul, Roosevelt continues to be the man of the hour.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, men towering high above such political pygmies,\r\nmen of refinement, of culture, of ability, are jeered into silence as\r\nmollycoddles.  It is absurd to claim that ours is the era of\r\nindividualism.  Ours is merely a more poignant repetition of the\r\nphenomenon of all history: every effort for progress, for\r\nenlightenment, for science, for religious, political, and economic\r\nliberty, emanates from the minority, and not from the mass.  Today,\r\nas ever, the few are misunderstood, hounded, imprisoned, tortured,\r\nand killed.\r\n\r\nThe principle of brotherhood expounded by the agitator of Nazareth\r\npreserved the germ of life, of truth and justice, so long as it was\r\nthe beacon light of the few.  The moment the majority seized upon it,\r\nthat great principle became a shibboleth and harbinger of blood and\r\nfire, spreading suffering and disaster.  The attack on the\r\nomnipotence of Rome was like a sunrise amid the darkness of the\r\nnight, only so long as it was made by the colossal figures of a Huss,\r\na Calvin, or a Luther.  Yet when the mass joined in the procession\r\nagainst the Catholic monster, it was no less cruel, no less\r\nbloodthirsty than its enemy.  Woe to the heretics, to the minority,\r\nwho would not bow to its dicta.  After infinite zeal, endurance, and\r\nsacrifice, the human mind is at last free from the religious phantom;\r\nthe minority has gone on in pursuit of new conquests, and the\r\nmajority is lagging behind, handicapped by truth grown false with\r\nage.\r\n\r\nPolitically the human race would still be in the most absolute\r\nslavery, were it not for the John Balls, the Wat Tylers, the Tells,\r\nthe innumerable individual giants who fought inch by inch against the\r\npower of kings and tyrants.  But for individual pioneers the world\r\nwould have never been shaken to its very roots by that tremendous\r\nwave, the French Revolution.  Great events are usually preceded by\r\napparently small things.  Thus the eloquence and fire of Camille\r\nDesmoulins was like the trumpet before Jericho, razing to the ground\r\nthat emblem of torture, of abuse, of horror, the Bastille.\r\n\r\nAlways, at every period, the few were the banner bearers of a great\r\nidea, of liberating effort.  Not so the mass, the leaden weight of\r\nwhich does not let it move.  The truth of this is borne out in Russia\r\nwith greater force than elsewhere.  Thousands of lives have already\r\nbeen consumed by that bloody regime, yet the monster on the throne is\r\nnot appeased.  How is such a thing possible when ideas, culture,\r\nliterature, when the deepest and finest emotions groan under the iron\r\nyoke?  The majority, that compact, immobile, drowsy mass, the Russian\r\npeasant, after a century of struggle, of sacrifice, of untold misery,\r\nstill believes that the rope which strangles \"the man with the white\r\nhands\"[1] brings luck.\r\n\r\nIn the American struggle for liberty, the majority was no less of a\r\nstumbling block.  Until this very day the ideas of Jefferson, of\r\nPatrick Henry, of Thomas Paine, are denied and sold by their\r\nposterity.  The mass wants none of them.  The greatness and courage\r\nworshipped in Lincoln have been forgotten in the men who created the\r\nbackground for the panorama of that time.  The true patron saints of\r\nthe black men were represented in that handful of fighters in Boston,\r\nLloyd Garrison, Wendell Phillips, Thoreau, Margaret Fuller, and\r\nTheodore Parker, whose great courage and sturdiness culminated in\r\nthat somber giant, John Brown.  Their untiring zeal, their eloquence\r\nand perseverance undermined the stronghold of the Southern lords.\r\nLincoln and his minions followed only when abolition had become a\r\npractical issue, recognized as such by all.\r\n\r\nAbout fifty years ago, a meteor-like idea made its appearance on the\r\nsocial horizon of the world, an idea so far-reaching, so\r\nrevolutionary, so all-embracing as to spread terror in the hearts of\r\ntyrants everywhere.  On the other hand, that idea was a harbinger of\r\njoy, of cheer, of hope to the millions.  The pioneers knew the\r\ndifficulties in their way, they knew the opposition, the persecution,\r\nthe hardships that would meet them, but proud and unafraid they\r\nstarted on their march onward, ever onward.  Now that idea has become\r\na popular slogan.  Almost everyone is a Socialist today: the rich\r\nman, as well as his poor victim; the upholders of law and authority,\r\nas well as their unfortunate culprits; the freethinker, as well as\r\nthe perpetuator of religious falsehoods; the fashionable lady, as\r\nwell as the shirtwaist girl.  Why not?  Now that the truth of fifty\r\nyears ago has become a lie, now that it has been clipped of all its\r\nyouthful imagination, and been robbed of its vigor, its strength, its\r\nrevolutionary ideal--why not? Now that it is no longer a beautiful\r\nvision, but a \"practical, workable scheme,\" resting on the will of\r\nthe majority, why not?  With the same political cunning and\r\nshrewdness the mass is petted, pampered, cheated daily.  Its praise\r\nis being sung in many keys: the poor majority, the outraged, the\r\nabused, the giant majority, if only it would follow us.\r\n\r\nWho has not heard this litany before?  Who does not know this\r\nnever-varying refrain of all politicians?  That the mass bleeds, that\r\nit is being robbed and exploited, I know as well as our vote-baiters.\r\nBut I insist that not the handful of parasites, but the mass itself\r\nis responsible for this horrible state of affairs.  It clings to its\r\nmasters, loves the whip, and is the first to cry Crucify! the moment\r\na protesting voice is raised against the sacredness of capitalistic\r\nauthority or any other decayed institution.  Yet how long would\r\nauthority and private property exist, if not for the willingness of\r\nthe mass to become soldiers, policemen, jailers, and hangmen.  The\r\nSocialist demagogues know that as well as I, but they maintain the\r\nmyth of the virtues of the majority, because their very scheme of\r\nlife means the perpetuation of power.  And how could the latter be\r\nacquired without numbers?  Yes, power, authority, coercion, and\r\ndependence rest on the mass, but never freedom, never the free\r\nunfoldment of the individual, never the birth of a free society.\r\n\r\nNot because I do not feel with the oppressed, the disinherited of the\r\nearth; not because I do not know the shame, the horror, the indignity\r\nof the lives the people lead, do I repudiate the majority as a\r\ncreative force for good.  Oh, no, no!  But because I know so well\r\nthat as a compact mass it has never stood for justice or equality.\r\nIt has suppressed the human voice, subdued the human spirit, chained\r\nthe human body.  As a mass its aim has always been to make life\r\nuniform, gray, and monotonous as the desert.  As a mass it will\r\nalways be the annihilator of individuality, of free initiative, of\r\noriginality.  I therefore believe with Emerson that \"the masses are\r\ncrude, lame, pernicious in their demands and influence, and need not\r\nto be flattered, but to be schooled.  I wish not to concede anything\r\nto them, but to drill, divide, and break them up, and draw\r\nindividuals out of them.  Masses!  The calamity are the masses.  I do\r\nnot wish any mass at all, but honest men only, lovely, sweet,\r\naccomplished women only.\"\r\n\r\nIn other words, the living, vital truth of social and economic\r\nwell-being will become a reality only through the zeal, courage, the\r\nnon-compromising determination of intelligent minorities, and not\r\nthrough the mass.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The intellectuals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PSYCHOLOGY OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nTo analyze the psychology of political violence is not only extremely\r\ndifficult, but also very dangerous.  If such acts are treated with\r\nunderstanding, one is immediately accused of eulogizing them.  If, on\r\nthe other hand, human sympathy is expressed with the ATTENTATER,[1] one\r\nrisks being considered a possible accomplice.  Yet it is only\r\nintelligence and sympathy that can bring us closer to the source of\r\nhuman suffering, and teach us the ultimate way out of it.\r\n\r\nThe primitive man, ignorant of natural forces, dreaded their\r\napproach, hiding from the perils they threatened.  As man learned to\r\nunderstand Nature's phenomena, he realized that though these may\r\ndestroy life and cause great loss, they also bring relief.  To the\r\nearnest student it must be apparent that the accumulated forces in\r\nour social and economic life, culminating in a political act of\r\nviolence, are similar to the terrors of the atmosphere, manifested in\r\nstorm and lightning.\r\n\r\nTo thoroughly appreciate the truth of this view, one must feel\r\nintensely the indignity of our social wrongs; one's very being must\r\nthrob with the pain, the sorrow, the despair millions of people are\r\ndaily made to endure.  Indeed, unless we have become a part of\r\nhumanity, we cannot even faintly understand the just indignation that\r\naccumulates in a human soul, the burning, surging passion that makes\r\nthe storm inevitable.\r\n\r\nThe ignorant mass looks upon the man who makes a violent protest\r\nagainst our social and economic iniquities as upon a wild beast, a\r\ncruel, heartless monster, whose joy it is to destroy life and bathe\r\nin blood; or at best, as upon an irresponsible lunatic.  Yet nothing\r\nis further from the truth.  As a matter of fact, those who have\r\nstudied the character and personality of these men, or who have come\r\nin close contact with them, are agreed that it is their\r\nsuper-sensitiveness to the wrong and injustice surrounding them which\r\ncompels them to pay the toll of our social crimes.  The most noted\r\nwriters and poets, discussing the psychology of political offenders,\r\nhave paid them the highest tribute.  Could anyone assume that these\r\nmen had advised violence, or even approved of the acts?  Certainly\r\nnot.  Theirs was the attitude of the social student, of the man who\r\nknows that beyond every violent act there is a vital cause.\r\n\r\nBjornstjerne Bjornson, in the second part of BEYOND HUMAN POWER,\r\nemphasizes the fact that it is among the Anarchists that we must look\r\nfor the modern martyrs who pay for their faith with their blood, and\r\nwho welcome death with a smile, because they believe, as truly as\r\nChrist did, that their martyrdom will redeem humanity.\r\n\r\nFrancois Coppee, the French novelist, thus expresses himself\r\nregarding the psychology of the ATTENTATER:\r\n\r\n\"The reading of the details of Vaillant's execution left me in a\r\nthoughtful mood.  I imagined him expanding his chest under the ropes,\r\nmarching with firm step, stiffening his will, concentrating all his\r\nenergy, and, with eyes fixed upon the knife, hurling finally at\r\nsociety his cry of malediction.  And, in spite of me, another\r\nspectacle rose suddenly before my mind.  I saw a group of men and\r\nwomen pressing against each other in the middle of the oblong arena\r\nof the circus, under the gaze of thousands of eyes, while from all\r\nthe steps of the immense amphitheatre went up the terrible cry, AD\r\nLEONES! and, below, the opening cages of the wild beasts.\r\n\r\n\"I did not believe the execution would take place.  In the first\r\nplace, no victim had been struck with death, and it had long been the\r\ncustom not to punish an abortive crime with the last degree of\r\nseverity.  Then, this crime, however terrible in intention, was\r\ndisinterested, born of an abstract idea.  The man's past, his\r\nabandoned childhood, his life of hardship, pleaded also in his favor.\r\nIn the independent press generous voices were raised in his behalf,\r\nvery loud and eloquent.  'A purely literary current of opinion' some\r\nhave said, with no little scorn.  IT IS, ON THE CONTRARY, AN HONOR TO\r\nTHE MEN OF ART AND THOUGHT TO HAVE EXPRESSED ONCE MORE THEIR DISGUST\r\nAT THE SCAFFOLD.\"\r\n\r\nAgain Zola, in GERMINAL and PARIS, describes the tenderness and\r\nkindness, the deep sympathy with human suffering, of these men who\r\nclose the chapter of their lives with a violent outbreak against our\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nLast, but not least, the man who probably better than anyone else\r\nunderstands the psychology of the ATTENTATER is M. Hamon, the author\r\nof the brilliant work, UNE PSYCHOLOGIE DU MILITAIRE PROFESSIONEL, who\r\nhas arrived at these suggestive conclusions:\r\n\r\n\"The positive method confirmed by the rational method enables us to\r\nestablish an ideal type of Anarchist, whose mentality is the\r\naggregate of common psychic characteristics.  Every Anarchist\r\npartakes sufficiently of this ideal type to make it possible to\r\ndifferentiate him from other men.  The typical Anarchist, then, may\r\nbe defined as follows: A man perceptible by the spirit of revolt\r\nunder one or more of its forms,--opposition, investigation,\r\ncriticism, innovation,--endowed with a strong love of liberty,\r\negoistic or individualistic, and possessed of great curiosity, a keen\r\ndesire to know.  These traits are supplemented by an ardent love of\r\nothers, a highly developed moral sensitiveness, a profound sentiment\r\nof justice, and imbued with missionary zeal.\"\r\n\r\nTo the above characteristics, says Alvin F. Sanborn, must be added\r\nthese sterling qualities: a rare love of animals, surpassing\r\nsweetness in all the ordinary relations of life, exceptional sobriety\r\nof demeanor, frugality and regularity, austerity, even, of living,\r\nand courage beyond compare.[2]\r\n\r\n\"There is a truism that the man in the street seems always to forget,\r\nwhen he is abusing the Anarchists, or whatever party happens to be\r\nhis BETE NOIRE for the moment, as the cause of some outrage just\r\nperpetrated.  This indisputable fact is that homicidal outrages have,\r\nfrom time immemorial, been the reply of goaded and desperate classes,\r\nand goaded and desperate individuals, to wrongs from their fellowmen,\r\nwhich they felt to be intolerable.  Such acts are the violent recoil\r\nfrom violence, whether aggressive or repressive; they are the last\r\ndesperate struggle of outraged and exasperated human nature for\r\nbreathing space and life.  And their cause lies not in any special\r\nconviction, but in the depths of that human nature itself.  The whole\r\ncourse of history, political and social, is strewn with evidence of\r\nthis fact.  To go no further, take the three most notorious examples\r\nof political parties goaded into violence during the last fifty\r\nyears: the Mazzinians in Italy, the Fenians in Ireland, and the\r\nTerrorists in Russia.  Were these people Anarchists?  No.  Did they\r\nall three even hold the same political opinions?  No.  The Mazzinians\r\nwere Republicans, the Fenians political separatists, the Russians\r\nSocial Democrats or Constitutionalists.  But all were driven by\r\ndesperate circumstances into this terrible form of revolt.  And when\r\nwe turn from parties to individuals who have acted in like manner, we\r\nstand appalled by the number of human beings goaded and driven by\r\nsheer desperation into conduct obviously violently opposed to their\r\nsocial instincts.\r\n\r\n\"Now that Anarchism has become a living force in society, such deeds\r\nhave been sometimes committed by Anarchists, as well as by others.\r\nFor no new faith, even the most essentially peaceable and humane the\r\nmind of man has yet accepted, but at its first coming has brought\r\nupon earth not peace, but a sword; not because of anything violent or\r\nanti-social in the doctrine itself; simply because of the ferment any\r\nnew and creative idea excites in men's minds, whether they accept or\r\nreject it.  And a conception of Anarchism, which, on one hand,\r\nthreatens every vested interest, and, on the other, holds out a\r\nvision of a free and noble life to be won by a struggle against\r\nexisting wrongs, is certain to rouse the fiercest opposition, and\r\nbring the whole repressive force of ancient evil into violent contact\r\nwith the tumultuous outburst of a new hope.\r\n\r\n\"Under miserable conditions of life, any vision of the possibility of\r\nbetter things makes the present misery more intolerable, and spurs\r\nthose who suffer to the most energetic struggles to improve their\r\nlot, and if these struggles only immediately result in sharper\r\nmisery, the outcome is sheer desperation.  In our present society,\r\nfor instance, an exploited wage worker, who catches a glimpse of what\r\nwork and life might and ought to be, finds the toilsome routine and\r\nthe squalor of his existence almost intolerable; and even when he has\r\nthe resolution and courage to continue steadily working his best, and\r\nwaiting until new ideas have so permeated society as to pave the way\r\nfor better times, the mere fact that he has such ideas and tries to\r\nspread them, brings him into difficulties with his employers.  How\r\nmany thousands of Socialists, and above all Anarchists, have lost\r\nwork and even the chance of work, solely on the ground of their\r\nopinions.  It is only the specially gifted craftsman, who, if he be a\r\nzealous propagandist, can hope to retain permanent employment.  And\r\nwhat happens to a man with his brain working actively with a ferment\r\nof new ideas, with a vision before his eyes of a new hope dawning for\r\ntoiling and agonizing men, with the knowledge that his suffering and\r\nthat of his fellows in misery is not caused by the cruelty of fate,\r\nbut by the injustice of other human beings,--what happens to such a\r\nman when he sees those dear to him starving, when he himself is\r\nstarved?  Some natures in such a plight, and those by no means the\r\nleast social or the least sensitive, will become violent, and will\r\neven feel that their violence is social and not anti-social, that in\r\nstriking when and how they can, they are striking, not for\r\nthemselves, but for human nature, outraged and despoiled in their\r\npersons and in those of their fellow sufferers.  And are we, who\r\nourselves are not in this horrible predicament, to stand by and\r\ncoldly condemn these piteous victims of the Furies and Fates?  Are we\r\nto decry as miscreants these human beings who act with heroic\r\nself-devotion, sacrificing their lives in protest, where less social\r\nand less energetic natures would lie down and grovel in abject\r\nsubmission to injustice and wrong?  Are we to join the ignorant and\r\nbrutal outcry which stigmatizes such men as monsters of wickedness,\r\ngratuitously running amuck in a harmonious and innocently peaceful\r\nsociety?  No!  We hate murder with a hatred that may seem absurdly\r\nexaggerated to apologists for Matabele massacres, to callous\r\nacquiescers in hangings and bombardments, but we decline in such\r\ncases of homicide, or attempted homicide, as those of which we are\r\ntreating, to be guilty of the cruel injustice of flinging the whole\r\nresponsibility of the deed upon the immediate perpetrator.  The guilt\r\nof these homicides lies upon every man and woman who, intentionally\r\nor by cold indifference, helps to keep up social conditions that\r\ndrive human beings to despair.  The man who flings his whole life\r\ninto the attempt, at the cost of his own life, to protest against the\r\nwrongs of his fellow men, is a saint compared to the active and\r\npassive upholders of cruelty and injustice, even if his protest\r\ndestroy other lives besides his own.  Let him who is without sin in\r\nsociety cast the first stone at such an one.\"[3]\r\n\r\nThat every act of political violence should nowadays be attributed to\r\nAnarchists is not at all surprising.  Yet it is a fact known to\r\nalmost everyone familiar with the Anarchist movement that a great\r\nnumber of acts, for which Anarchists had to suffer, either originated\r\nwith the capitalist press or were instigated, if not directly\r\nperpetrated, by the police.\r\n\r\nFor a number of years acts of violence had been committed in Spain,\r\nfor which the Anarchists were held responsible, hounded like wild\r\nbeasts, and thrown into prison.  Later it was disclosed that the\r\nperpetrators of these acts were not Anarchists, but members of the\r\npolice department.  The scandal became so widespread that the\r\nconservative Spanish papers demanded the apprehension and punishment\r\nof the gang-leader, Juan Rull, who was subsequently condemned to\r\ndeath and executed.  The sensational evidence, brought to light\r\nduring the trial, forced Police Inspector Momento to exonerate\r\ncompletely the Anarchists from any connection with the acts committed\r\nduring a long period.  This resulted in the dismissal of a number of\r\npolice officials, among them Inspector Tressols, who, in revenge,\r\ndisclosed the fact that behind the gang of police bomb throwers were\r\nothers of far higher position, who provided them with funds and\r\nprotected them.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the many striking examples of how Anarchist\r\nconspiracies are manufactured.\r\n\r\nThat the American police can perjure themselves with the same ease,\r\nthat they are just as merciless, just as brutal and cunning as their\r\nEuropean colleagues, has been proven on more than one occasion.  We\r\nneed only recall the tragedy of the eleventh of November, 1887, known\r\nas the Haymarket Riot.\r\n\r\nNo one who is at all familiar with the case can possibly doubt that\r\nthe Anarchists, judicially murdered in Chicago, died as victims of a\r\nlying, bloodthirsty press and of a cruel police conspiracy.  Has not\r\nJudge Gary himself said: \"Not because you have caused the Haymarket\r\nbomb, but because you are Anarchists, you are on trial.\"\r\n\r\nThe impartial and thorough analysis by Governor Altgeld of that\r\nblotch on the American escutcheon verified the brutal frankness of\r\nJudge Gary.  It was this that induced Altgeld to pardon the three\r\nAnarchists, thereby earning the lasting esteem of every liberty\r\nloving man and woman in the world.\r\n\r\nWhen we approach the tragedy of September sixth, 1901, we are\r\nconfronted by one of the most striking examples of how little social\r\ntheories are responsible for an act of political violence.  \"Leon\r\nCzolgosz, an Anarchist, incited to commit the act by Emma Goldman.\"\r\nTo be sure, has she not incited violence even before her birth, and\r\nwill she not continue to do so beyond death?  Everything is possible\r\nwith the Anarchists.\r\n\r\nToday, even, nine years after the tragedy, after it was proven a\r\nhundred times that Emma Goldman had nothing to do with the event,\r\nthat no evidence whatsoever exists to indicate that Czolgosz ever\r\ncalled himself an Anarchist, we are confronted with the same lie,\r\nfabricated by the police and perpetuated by the press.  No living\r\nsoul ever heard Czolgosz make that statement, nor is there a single\r\nwritten word to prove that the boy ever breathed the accusation.\r\nNothing but ignorance and insane hysteria, which have never yet been\r\nable to solve the simplest problem of cause and effect.\r\n\r\nThe President of a free Republic killed!  What else can be the cause,\r\nexcept that the ATTENTATER must have been insane, or that he was\r\nincited to the act.\r\n\r\nA free Republic!  How a myth will maintain itself, how it will\r\ncontinue to deceive, to dupe, and blind even the comparatively\r\nintelligent to its monstrous absurdities.  A free Republic!  And yet\r\nwithin a little over thirty years a small band of parasites have\r\nsuccessfully robbed the American people, and trampled upon the\r\nfundamental principles, laid down by the fathers of this country,\r\nguaranteeing to every man, woman, and child \"life, liberty, and the\r\npursuit of happiness.\"  For thirty years they have been increasing\r\ntheir wealth and power at the expense of the vast mass of workers,\r\nthereby enlarging the army of the unemployed, the hungry, homeless,\r\nand friendless portion of humanity, who are tramping the country from\r\neast to west, from north to south, in a vain search for work.  For\r\nmany years the home has been left to the care of the little ones,\r\nwhile the parents are exhausting their life and strength for a mere\r\npittance.  For thirty years the sturdy sons of America have been\r\nsacrificed on the battlefield of industrial war, and the daughters\r\noutraged in corrupt factory surroundings.  For long and weary years\r\nthis process of undermining the nation's health, vigor, and pride,\r\nwithout much protest from the disinherited and oppressed, has been\r\ngoing on.  Maddened by success and victory, the money powers of this\r\n\"free land of ours\" became more and more audacious in their\r\nheartless, cruel efforts to compete with the rotten and decayed\r\nEuropean tyrannies for supremacy of power.\r\n\r\nIn vain did a lying press repudiate Leon Czolgosz as a foreigner.\r\nThe boy was a product of our own free American soil, that lulled him\r\nto sleep with,\r\n\r\n     My country, 'tis of thee,\r\n     Sweet land of liberty.\r\n\r\nWho can tell how many times this American child had gloried in the\r\ncelebration of the Fourth of July, or of Decoration Day, when he\r\nfaithfully honored the Nation's dead?  Who knows but that he, too,\r\nwas willing to \"fight for his country and die for her liberty,\" until\r\nit dawned upon him that those he belonged to have no country, because\r\nthey have been robbed of all that they have produced; until he\r\nrealized that the liberty and independence of his youthful dreams\r\nwere but a farce.  Poor Leon Czolgosz, your crime consisted of too\r\nsensitive a social consciousness.  Unlike your idealless and\r\nbrainless American brothers, your ideals soared above the belly and\r\nthe bank account.  No wonder you impressed the one human being among\r\nall the infuriated mob at your trial--a newspaper woman--as a\r\nvisionary, totally oblivious to your surroundings.  Your large,\r\ndreamy eyes must have beheld a new and glorious dawn.\r\n\r\nNow, to a recent instance of police-manufactured Anarchist plots.\r\nIn that bloodstained city, Chicago, the life of Chief of Police\r\nShippy was attempted by a young man named Averbuch.  Immediately the\r\ncry was sent to the four corners of the world that Averbuch was an\r\nAnarchist, and that Anarchists were responsible for the act.\r\nEveryone who was at all known to entertain Anarchist ideas was\r\nclosely watched, a number of people arrested, the library of an\r\nAnarchist group confiscated, and all meetings made impossible.  It\r\ngoes without saying that, as on various previous occasions, I must\r\nneeds be held responsible for the act.  Evidently the American police\r\ncredit me with occult powers.  I did not know Averbuch; in fact, had\r\nnever before heard his name, and the only way I could have possibly\r\n\"conspired\" with him was in my astral body.  But, then, the police\r\nare not concerned with logic or justice.  What they seek is a target,\r\nto mask their absolute ignorance of the cause, of the psychology of a\r\npolitical act.  Was Averbuch an Anarchist?  There is no positive\r\nproof of it.  He had been but three months in the country, did not\r\nknow the language, and, as far as I could ascertain, was quite\r\nunknown to the Anarchists of Chicago.\r\n\r\nWhat led to his act?  Averbuch, like most young Russian immigrants,\r\nundoubtedly believed in the mythical liberty of America.  He received\r\nhis first baptism by the policeman's club during the brutal\r\ndispersement of the unemployed parade.  He further experienced\r\nAmerican equality and opportunity in the vain efforts to find an\r\neconomic master.  In short, a three months' sojourn in the glorious\r\nland brought him face to face with the fact that the disinherited are\r\nin the same position the world over.  In his native land he probably\r\nlearned that necessity knows no law--there was no difference between\r\na Russian and an American policeman.\r\n\r\nThe question to the intelligent social student is not whether the\r\nacts of Czolgosz or Averbuch were practical, any more than whether\r\nthe thunderstorm is practical.  The thing that will inevitably\r\nimpress itself on the thinking and feeling man and woman is that the\r\nsight of brutal clubbing of innocent victims in a so-called free\r\nRepublic, and the degrading, soul-destroying economic struggle,\r\nfurnish the spark that kindles the dynamic force in the overwrought,\r\noutraged souls of men like Czolgosz or Averbuch.  No amount of\r\npersecution, of hounding, of repression, can stay this social\r\nphenomenon.\r\n\r\nBut, it is often asked, have not acknowledged Anarchists committed\r\nacts of violence?  Certainly they have, always however ready to\r\nshoulder the responsibility.  My contention is that they were\r\nimpelled, not by the teachings of Anarchism, but by the tremendous\r\npressure of conditions, making life unbearable to their sensitive\r\nnatures.  Obviously, Anarchism, or any other social theory, making\r\nman a conscious social unit, will act as a leaven for rebellion.\r\nThis is not a mere assertion, but a fact verified by all experience.\r\nA close examination of the circumstances bearing upon this question\r\nwill further clarify my position.\r\n\r\nLet us consider some of the most important Anarchist acts within the\r\nlast two decades.  Strange as it may seem, one of the most\r\nsignificant deeds of political violence occurred here in America, in\r\nconnection with the Homestead strike of 1892.\r\n\r\nDuring that memorable time the Carnegie Steel Company organized a\r\nconspiracy to crush the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel\r\nWorkers.  Henry Clay Frick, then Chairman of the Company, was\r\nintrusted with that democratic task.  He lost no time in carrying out\r\nthe policy of breaking the Union, the policy which he had so\r\nsuccessfully practiced during his reign of terror in the coke\r\nregions.  Secretly, and while peace negotiations were being purposely\r\nprolonged, Frick supervised the military preparations, the\r\nfortification of the Homestead Steel Works, the erection of a high\r\nboard fence, capped with barbed wire and provided with loopholes for\r\nsharpshooters.  And then, in the dead of night, he attempted to\r\nsmuggle his army of hired Pinkerton thugs into Homestead, which act\r\nprecipitated the terrible carnage of the steel workers.  Not content\r\nwith the death of eleven victims, killed in the Pinkerton skirmish,\r\nHenry Clay Frick, good Christian and free American, straightway began\r\nthe hounding down of the helpless wives and orphans, by ordering them\r\nout of the wretched Company houses.\r\n\r\nThe whole country was aroused over these inhuman outrages.  Hundreds\r\nof voices were raised in protest, calling on Frick to desist, not to\r\ngo too far.  Yes, hundreds of people protested,--as one objects to\r\nannoying flies.  Only one there was who actively responded to the\r\noutrage at Homestead,--Alexander Berkman.  Yes, he was an Anarchist.\r\nHe gloried in that fact, because it was the only force that made the\r\ndiscord between his spiritual longing and the world without at all\r\nbearable.  Yet not Anarchism, as such, but the brutal slaughter of\r\nthe eleven steel workers was the urge for Alexander Berkman's act,\r\nhis attempt on the life of Henry Clay Frick.\r\n\r\nThe record of European acts of political violence affords numerous\r\nand striking instances of the influence of environment upon sensitive\r\nhuman beings.\r\n\r\nThe court speech of Vaillant, who, in 1894, exploded a bomb in the\r\nParis Chamber of Deputies, strikes the true keynote of the psychology\r\nof such acts:\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen, in a few minutes you are to deal your blow, but in\r\nreceiving your verdict I shall have at least the satisfaction of\r\nhaving wounded the existing society, that cursed society in which one\r\nmay see a single man spending, uselessly, enough to feed thousands of\r\nfamilies; an infamous society which permits a few individuals to\r\nmonopolize all the social wealth, while there are hundreds of\r\nthousands of unfortunates who have not even the bread that is not\r\nrefused to dogs, and while entire families are committing suicide for\r\nwant of the necessities of life.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, gentlemen, if the governing classes could go down among the\r\nunfortunates!  But no, they prefer to remain deaf to their appeals.\r\nIt seems that a fatality impels them, like the royalty of the\r\neighteenth century, toward the precipice which will engulf them, for\r\nwoe be to those who remain deaf to the cries of the starving, woe to\r\nthose who, believing themselves of superior essence, assume the right\r\nto exploit those beneath them!  There comes a time when the people no\r\nlonger reason; they rise like a hurricane, and pass away like a\r\ntorrent.  Then we see bleeding heads impaled on pikes.\r\n\r\n\"Among the exploited, gentlemen, there are two classes of\r\nindividuals: Those of one class, not realizing what they are and what\r\nthey might be, take life as it comes, believe that they are born to\r\nbe slaves, and content themselves with the little that is given them\r\nin exchange for their labor.  But there are others, on the contrary,\r\nwho think, who study, and who, looking about them, discover social\r\niniquities.  Is it their fault if they see clearly and suffer at\r\nseeing others suffer?  Then they throw themselves into the struggle,\r\nand make themselves the bearers of the popular claims.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen, I am one of these last.  Wherever I have gone, I have\r\nseen unfortunates bent beneath the yoke of capital.  Everywhere I\r\nhave seen the same wounds causing tears of blood to flow, even in the\r\nremoter parts of the inhabited districts of South America, where I\r\nhad the right to believe that he who was weary of the pains of\r\ncivilization might rest in the shade of the palm trees and there\r\nstudy nature.  Well, there even, more than elsewhere, I have seen\r\ncapital come, like a vampire, to suck the last drop of blood of the\r\nunfortunate pariahs.\r\n\r\n\"Then I came back to France, where it was reserved for me to see my\r\nfamily suffer atrociously.  This was the last drop in the cup of my\r\nsorrow.  Tired of leading this life of suffering and cowardice, I\r\ncarried this bomb to those who are primarily responsible for social\r\nsufferings.\r\n\r\n\"I am reproached with the wounds of those who were hit by my\r\nprojectiles.  Permit me to point out in passing that, if the\r\nbourgeois had not massacred or caused massacres during the\r\nRevolution, it is probable that they would still be under the yoke of\r\nthe nobility.  On the other hand, figure up the dead and wounded on\r\nTonquin, Madagascar, Dahomey, adding thereto the thousands, yes,\r\nmillions of unfortunates who die in the factories, the mines, and\r\nwherever the grinding power of capital is felt.  Add also those who\r\ndie of hunger, and all this with the assent of our Deputies.  Beside\r\nall this, of how little weight are the reproaches now brought against\r\nme!\r\n\r\n\"It is true that one does not efface the other; but, after all, are\r\nwe not acting on the defensive when we respond to the blows which we\r\nreceive from above?  I know very well that I shall be told that I\r\nought to have confined myself to speech for the vindication of the\r\npeople's claims.  But what can you expect!  It takes a loud voice to\r\nmake the deaf hear.  Too long have they answered our voices by\r\nimprisonment, the rope, rifle volleys.  Make no mistake; the\r\nexplosion of my bomb is not only the cry of the rebel Vaillant, but\r\nthe cry of an entire class which vindicates its rights, and which\r\nwill soon add acts to words.  For, be sure of it, in vain will they\r\npass laws.  The ideas of the thinkers will not halt; just as, in the\r\nlast century, all the governmental forces could not prevent the\r\nDiderots and the Voltaires from spreading emancipating ideas among\r\nthe people, so all the existing governmental forces will not prevent\r\nthe Reclus, the Darwins, the Spencers, the Ibsens, the Mirbeaus, from\r\nspreading the ideas of justice and liberty which will annihilate the\r\nprejudices that hold the mass in ignorance.  And these ideas,\r\nwelcomed by the unfortunate, will flower in acts of revolt as they\r\nhave done in me, until the day when the disappearance of authority\r\nshall permit all men to organize freely according to their choice,\r\nwhen we shall each be able to enjoy the product of his labor, and\r\nwhen those moral maladies called prejudices shall vanish, permitting\r\nhuman beings to live in harmony, having no other desire than to study\r\nthe sciences and love their fellows.\r\n\r\n\"I conclude, gentlemen, by saying that a society in which one sees\r\nsuch social inequalities as we see all about us, in which we see\r\nevery day suicides caused by poverty, prostitution flaring at every\r\nstreet corner,--a society whose principal monuments are barracks and\r\nprisons,--such a society must be transformed as soon as possible, on\r\npain of being eliminated, and that speedily, from the human race.\r\nHail to him who labors, by no matter what means, for this\r\ntransformation!  It is this idea that has guided me in my duel with\r\nauthority, but as in this duel I have only wounded my adversary, it\r\nis now its turn to strike me.\r\n\r\n\"Now, gentlemen, to me it matters little what penalty you may\r\ninflict, for, looking at this assembly with the eyes of reason, I can\r\nnot help smiling to see you, atoms lost in matter, and reasoning only\r\nbecause you possess a prolongation of the spinal marrow, assume the\r\nright to judge one of your fellows.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! gentlemen, how little a thing is your assembly and your verdict\r\nin the history of humanity; and human history, in its turn, is\r\nlikewise a very little thing in the whirlwind which bears it through\r\nimmensity, and which is destined to disappear, or at least to be\r\ntransformed, in order to begin again the same history and the same\r\nfacts, a veritably perpetual play of cosmic forces renewing and\r\ntransferring themselves forever.\"\r\n\r\nWill anyone say that Vaillant was an ignorant, vicious man, or a\r\nlunatic?  Was not his mind singularly clear, analytic?  No wonder\r\nthat the best intellectual forces of France spoke in his behalf, and\r\nsigned the petition to President Carnot, asking him to commute\r\nVaillant's death sentence.\r\n\r\nCarnot would listen to no entreaty; he insisted on more than a pound\r\nof flesh, he wanted Vaillant's life, and then--the inevitable\r\nhappened: President Carnot was killed.  On the handle of the stiletto\r\nused by the ATTENTATER was engraved, significantly,\r\n\r\n                            VAILLANT!\r\n\r\n\r\nSanta Caserio was an Anarchist.  He could have gotten away, saved\r\nhimself; but he remained, he stood the consequences.\r\n\r\nHis reasons for the act are set forth in so simple, dignified, and\r\nchildlike manner that one is reminded of the touching tribute paid\r\nCaserio by his teacher of the little village school, Ada Negri, the\r\nItalian poet, who spoke of him as a sweet, tender plant, of too fine\r\nand sensitive texture to stand the cruel strain of the world.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen of the Jury!  I do not propose to make a defense, but only\r\nan explanation of my deed.\r\n\r\n\"Since my early youth I began to learn that present society is badly\r\norganized, so badly that every day many wretched men commit suicide,\r\nleaving women and children in the most terrible distress.  Workers,\r\nby thousands, seek for work and can not find it.  Poor families beg\r\nfor food and shiver with cold; they suffer the greatest misery; the\r\nlittle ones ask their miserable mothers for food, and the mothers\r\ncan not give them, because they have nothing.  The few things\r\nwhich the home contained have already been sold or pawned.  All they\r\ncan do is beg alms; often they are arrested as vagabonds.\r\n\r\n\"I went away from my native place because I was frequently moved to\r\ntears at seeing little girls of eight or ten years obliged to work\r\nfifteen hours a day for the paltry pay of twenty centimes.  Young\r\nwomen of eighteen or twenty also work fifteen hours daily, for a\r\nmockery of remuneration.  And that happens not only to my fellow\r\ncountrymen, but to all the workers, who sweat the whole day long for\r\na crust of bread, while their labor produces wealth in abundance.\r\nThe workers are obliged to live under the most wretched conditions,\r\nand their food consists of a little bread, a few spoonfuls of rice,\r\nand water; so by the time they are thirty or forty years old, they\r\nare exhausted, and go to die in the hospitals.  Besides, in\r\nconsequence of bad food and overwork, these unhappy creatures are, by\r\nhundreds, devoured by pellagra--a disease that, in my country,\r\nattacks, as the physicians say, those who are badly fed and lead a\r\nlife of toil and privation.\r\n\r\n\"I have observed that there are a great many people who are hungry,\r\nand many children who suffer, whilst bread and clothes abound in the\r\ntowns.  I saw many and large shops full of clothing and woolen\r\nstuffs, and I also saw warehouses full of wheat and Indian corn,\r\nsuitable for those who are in want.  And, on the other hand, I saw\r\nthousands of people who do not work, who produce nothing and live on\r\nthe labor of others; who spend every day thousands of francs for\r\ntheir amusement; who debauch the daughters of the workers; who own\r\ndwellings of forty or fifty rooms; twenty or thirty horses, many\r\nservants; in a word, all the pleasures of life.\r\n\r\n\"I believed in God; but when I saw so great an inequality between\r\nmen, I acknowledged that it was not God who created man, but man who\r\ncreated God.  And I discovered that those who want their property to\r\nbe respected, have an interest in preaching the existence of paradise\r\nand hell, and in keeping the people in ignorance.\r\n\r\n\"Not long ago, Vaillant threw a bomb in the Chamber of Deputies, to\r\nprotest against the present system of society.  He killed no one,\r\nonly wounded some persons; yet bourgeois justice sentenced him to\r\ndeath.  And not satisfied with the condemnation of the guilty man,\r\nthey began to pursue the Anarchists, and arrest not only those who\r\nhad known Vaillant, but even those who had merely been present at any\r\nAnarchist lecture.\r\n\r\n\"The government did not think of their wives and children.  It did\r\nnot consider that the men kept in prison were not the only ones who\r\nsuffered, and that their little ones cried for bread.  Bourgeois\r\njustice did not trouble itself about these innocent ones, who do not\r\nyet know what society is.  It is no fault of theirs that their\r\nfathers are in prison; they only want to eat.\r\n\r\n\"The government went on searching private houses, opening private\r\nletters, forbidding lectures and meetings, and practicing the most\r\ninfamous oppressions against us.  Even now, hundreds of Anarchists\r\nare arrested for having written an article in a newspaper, or for\r\nhaving expressed an opinion in public.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen of the Jury, you are representatives of bourgeois society.\r\nIf you want my head, take it; but do not believe that in so doing you\r\nwill stop the Anarchist propaganda.  Take care, for men reap what\r\nthey have sown.\"\r\n\r\nDuring a religious procession in 1896, at Barcelona, a bomb was\r\nthrown.  Immediately three hundred men and women were arrested.\r\nSome were Anarchists, but the majority were trade unionists and\r\nSocialists.  They were thrown into that terrible bastille, Montjuich,\r\nand subjected to most horrible tortures.  After a number had been\r\nkilled, or had gone insane, their cases were taken up by the liberal\r\npress of Europe, resulting in the release of a few survivors.\r\n\r\nThe man primarily responsible for this revival of the Inquisition was\r\nCanovas del Castillo, Prime Minister of Spain.  It was he who ordered\r\nthe torturing of the victims, their flesh burned, their bones\r\ncrushed, their tongues cut out.  Practiced in the art of brutality\r\nduring his regime in Cuba, Canovas remained absolutely deaf to the\r\nappeals and protests of the awakened civilized conscience.\r\n\r\nIn 1897 Canovas del Castillo was shot to death by a young Italian,\r\nAngiolillo.  The latter was an editor in his native land, and his\r\nbold utterances soon attracted the attention of the authorities.\r\nPersecution began, and Angiolillo fled from Italy to Spain, thence to\r\nFrance and Belgium, finally settling in England.  While there he\r\nfound employment as a compositor, and immediately became the friend\r\nof all his colleagues.  One of the latter thus described Angiolillo:\r\n\"His appearance suggested the journalist rather than the disciple of\r\nGuttenberg.  His delicate hands, moreover, betrayed the fact that he\r\nhad not grown up at the 'case.' With his handsome frank face, his\r\nsoft dark hair, his alert expression, he looked the very type of the\r\nvivacious Southerner.  Angiolillo spoke Italian, Spanish, and French,\r\nbut no English; the little French I knew was not sufficient to carry\r\non a prolonged conversation.  However, Angiolillo soon began to\r\nacquire the English idiom; he learned rapidly, playfully, and it was\r\nnot long until he became very popular with his fellow compositors.\r\nHis distinguished and yet modest manner, and his consideration\r\ntowards his colleagues, won him the hearts of all the boys.\"\r\n\r\nAngiolillo soon became familiar with the detailed accounts in the\r\npress.  He read of the great wave of human sympathy with the helpless\r\nvictims at Montjuich.  On Trafalgar Square he saw with his own eyes\r\nthe results of those atrocities, when the few Spaniards, who escaped\r\nCastillo's clutches, came to seek asylum in England.  There, at the\r\ngreat meeting, these men opened their shirts and showed the horrible\r\nscars of burned flesh.  Angiolillo saw, and the effect surpassed a\r\nthousand theories; the impetus was beyond words, beyond arguments,\r\nbeyond himself even.\r\n\r\nSenor Antonio Canovas del Castillo, Prime Minister of Spain,\r\nsojourned at Santa Agueda.  As usual in such cases, all strangers\r\nwere kept away from his exalted presence.  One exception was made,\r\nhowever, in the case of a distinguished looking, elegantly dressed\r\nItalian--the representative, it was understood, of an important\r\njournal.  The distinguished gentleman was--Angiolillo.\r\n\r\nSenor Canovas, about to leave his house, stepped on the veranda.\r\nSuddenly Angiolillo confronted him.  A shot rang out, and Canovas was\r\na corpse.\r\n\r\nThe wife of the Prime Minister rushed upon the scene.  \"Murderer!\r\nMurderer!\" she cried, pointing at Angiolillo.  The latter bowed.\r\n\"Pardon, Madame,\" he said, \"I respect you as a lady, but I regret\r\nthat you were the wife of that man.\"\r\n\r\nCalmly Angiolillo faced death.  Death in its most terrible form--for\r\nthe man whose soul was as a child's.\r\n\r\nHe was garroted.  His body lay, sun-kissed, till the day hid in\r\ntwilight.  And the people came, and pointing the finger of terror and\r\nfear, they said: \"There--the criminal--the cruel murderer.\"\r\n\r\nHow stupid, how cruel is ignorance!  It misunderstands always,\r\ncondemns always.\r\n\r\nA remarkable parallel to the case of Angiolillo is to be found in the\r\nact of Gaetano Bresci, whose ATTENTAT upon King Umberto made an\r\nAmerican city famous.\r\n\r\nBresci came to this country, this land of opportunity, where one has\r\nbut to try to meet with golden success.  Yes, he too would try to\r\nsucceed.  He would work hard and faithfully.  Work had no terrors\r\nfor him, if it would only help him to independence, manhood,\r\nself-respect.\r\n\r\nThus full of hope and enthusiasm he settled in Paterson, New Jersey,\r\nand there found a lucrative job at six dollars per week in one of the\r\nweaving mills of the town.  Six whole dollars per week was, no doubt,\r\na fortune for Italy, but not enough to breathe on in the new country.\r\nHe loved his little home.  He was a good husband and devoted father\r\nto his BAMBINA, Bianca, whom he adored.  He worked and worked for a\r\nnumber of years.  He actually managed to save one hundred dollars out\r\nof his six dollars per week.\r\n\r\nBresci had an ideal.  Foolish, I know, for a workingman to have an\r\nideal,--the Anarchist paper published in Paterson, LA QUESTIONE\r\nSOCIALE.\r\n\r\nEvery week, though tired from work, he would help to set up the\r\npaper.  Until later hours he would assist, and when the little\r\npioneer had exhausted all resources and his comrades were in despair,\r\nBresci brought cheer and hope, one hundred dollars, the entire\r\nsavings of years.  That would keep the paper afloat.\r\n\r\nIn his native land people were starving.  The crops had been poor,\r\nand the peasants saw themselves face to face with famine.  They\r\nappealed to their good King Umberto; he would help.  And he did.\r\nThe wives of the peasants who had gone to the palace of the King,\r\nheld up in mute silence their emaciated infants.  Surely that would\r\nmove him.  And then the soldiers fired and killed those poor fools.\r\n\r\nBresci, at work in the weaving mill at Paterson, read of the horrible\r\nmassacre.  His mental eye beheld the defenceless women and innocent\r\ninfants of his native land, slaughtered right before the good King.\r\nHis soul recoiled in horror.  At night he heard the groans of the\r\nwounded.  Some may have been his comrades, his own flesh.  Why, why\r\nthese foul murders?\r\n\r\nThe little meeting of the Italian Anarchist group in Paterson ended\r\nalmost in a fight.  Bresci had demanded his hundred dollars.  His\r\ncomrades begged, implored him to give them a respite.  The paper\r\nwould go down if they were to return him his loan.  But Bresci\r\ninsisted on its return.\r\n\r\nHow cruel and stupid is ignorance.  Bresci got the money, but lost\r\nthe good will, the confidence of his comrades.  They would have\r\nnothing more to do with one whose greed was greater than his ideals.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-ninth of July, 1900, King Umberto was shot at Monzo.\r\nThe young Italian weaver of Paterson, Gaetano Bresci, had taken the\r\nlife of the good King.\r\n\r\nPaterson was placed under police surveillance, everyone known as an\r\nAnarchist hounded and persecuted, and the act of Bresci ascribed to\r\nthe teachings of Anarchism.  As if the teachings of Anarchism in its\r\nextremest form could equal the force of those slain women and\r\ninfants, who had pilgrimed to the King for aid.  As if any spoken\r\nword, ever so eloquent, could burn into a human soul with such white\r\nheat as the life blood trickling drop by drop from those dying forms.\r\nThe ordinary man is rarely moved either by word or deed; and those\r\nwhose social kinship is the greatest living force need no appeal to\r\nrespond--even as does steel to the magnet--to the wrongs and horrors\r\nof society.\r\n\r\nIf a social theory is a strong factor inducing acts of political\r\nviolence, how are we to account for the recent violent outbreaks in\r\nIndia, where Anarchism has hardly been born.  More than any other old\r\nphilosophy, Hindu teachings have exalted passive resistance, the\r\ndrifting of life, the Nirvana, as the highest spiritual ideal.  Yet\r\nthe social unrest in India is daily growing, and has only recently\r\nresulted in an act of political violence, the killing of Sir Curzon\r\nWyllie by the Hindu, Madar Sol Dhingra.\r\n\r\nIf such a phenomenon can occur in a country socially and individually\r\npermeated for centuries with the spirit of passivity, can one\r\nquestion the tremendous, revolutionizing effect on human character\r\nexerted by great social iniquities?  Can one doubt the logic, the\r\njustice of these words:\r\n\r\n\"Repression, tyranny, and indiscriminate punishment of innocent men\r\nhave been the watchwords of the government of the alien domination in\r\nIndia ever since we began the commercial boycott of English goods.\r\nThe tiger qualities of the British are much in evidence now in India.\r\nThey think that by the strength of the sword they will keep down\r\nIndia!  It is this arrogance that has brought about the bomb, and the\r\nmore they tyrannize over a helpless and unarmed people, the more\r\nterrorism will grow.  We may deprecate terrorism as outlandish and\r\nforeign to our culture, but it is inevitable as long as this tyranny\r\ncontinues, for it is not the terrorists that are to be blamed, but\r\nthe tyrants who are responsible for it.  It is the only resource for\r\na helpless and unarmed people when brought to the verge of despair.\r\nIt is never criminal on their part.  The crime lies with the\r\ntyrant.\"[4]\r\n\r\nEven conservative scientists are beginning to realize that heredity\r\nis not the sole factor moulding human character.  Climate, food,\r\noccupation; nay, color, light, and sound must be considered in the\r\nstudy of human psychology.\r\n\r\nIf that be true, how much more correct is the contention that great\r\nsocial abuses will and must influence different minds and\r\ntemperaments in a different way.  And how utterly fallacious the\r\nstereotyped notion that the teachings of Anarchism, or certain\r\nexponents of these teachings, are responsible for the acts of\r\npolitical violence.\r\n\r\nAnarchism, more than any other social theory, values human life above\r\nthings.  All Anarchists agree with Tolstoy in this fundamental truth:\r\nif the production of any commodity necessitates the sacrifice of\r\nhuman life, society should do without that commodity, but it can not\r\ndo without that life.  That, however, nowise indicates that Anarchism\r\nteaches submission.  How can it, when it knows that all suffering,\r\nall misery, all ills, result from the evil of submission?\r\n\r\nHas not some American ancestor said, many years ago, that resistance\r\nto tyranny is obedience to God?  And he was not an Anarchist even.\r\nI would say that resistance to tyranny is man's highest ideal.  So\r\nlong as tyranny exists, in whatever form, man's deepest aspiration\r\nmust resist it as inevitably as man must breathe.\r\n\r\nCompared with the wholesale violence of capital and government,\r\npolitical acts of violence are but a drop in the ocean.  That so few\r\nresist is the strongest proof how terrible must be the conflict\r\nbetween their souls and unbearable social iniquities.\r\n\r\nHigh strung, like a violin string, they weep and moan for life, so\r\nrelentless, so cruel, so terribly inhuman.  In a desperate moment the\r\nstring breaks.  Untuned ears hear nothing but discord.  But those who\r\nfeel the agonized cry understand its harmony; they hear in it the\r\nfulfillment of the most compelling moment of human nature.\r\n\r\nSuch is the psychology of political violence.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] A revolutionist committing an act of political violence.\r\n\r\n[2] PARIS AND THE SOCIAL REVOLUTION.\r\n\r\n[3] From a pamphlet issued by the Freedom Group of London.\r\n\r\n[4] THE FREE HINDUSTAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRISONS: A SOCIAL CRIME AND FAILURE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1849, Feodor Dostoyevsky wrote on the wall of his prison cell the\r\nfollowing story of THE PRIEST AND THE DEVIL:\r\n\r\n\"'Hello, you little fat father!' the devil said to the priest.\r\n'What made you lie so to those poor, misled people?  What tortures of\r\nhell did you depict?  Don't you know they are already suffering the\r\ntortures of hell in their earthly lives?  Don't you know that you and\r\nthe authorities of the State are my representatives on earth?  It is\r\nyou that make them suffer the pains of hell with which you threaten\r\nthem.  Don't you know this?  Well, then, come with me!'\r\n\r\n\"The devil grabbed the priest by the collar, lifted him high in the\r\nair, and carried him to a factory, to an iron foundry.  He saw the\r\nworkmen there running and hurrying to and fro, and toiling in the\r\nscorching heat.  Very soon the thick, heavy air and the heat are too\r\nmuch for the priest.  With tears in his eyes, he pleads with the\r\ndevil: 'Let me go! Let me leave this hell!'\r\n\r\n\"'Oh, my dear friend, I must show you many more places.' The devil\r\ngets hold of him again and drags him off to a farm.  There he sees\r\nworkmen threshing the grain.  The dust and heat are insufferable.\r\nThe overseer carries a knout, and unmercifully beats anyone who falls\r\nto the ground overcome by hard toil or hunger.\r\n\r\n\"Next the priest is taken to the huts where these same workers live\r\nwith their families--dirty, cold, smoky, ill-smelling holes.  The\r\ndevil grins.  He points out the poverty and hardships which are at\r\nhome here.\r\n\r\n\"'Well, isn't this enough?' he asks.  And it seems as if even he, the\r\ndevil, pities the people.  The pious servant of God can hardly bear\r\nit.  With uplifted hands he begs: 'Let me go away from here.  Yes,\r\nyes!  This is hell on earth!'\r\n\r\n\"'Well, then, you see.  And you still promise them another hell.\r\nYou torment them, torture them to death mentally when they are\r\nalready all but dead physically!  Come on!  I will show you one more\r\nhell--one more, the very worst.'\r\n\r\n\"He took him to a prison and showed him a dungeon, with its foul air\r\nand the many human forms, robbed of all health and energy, lying on\r\nthe floor, covered with vermin that were devouring their poor, naked,\r\nemaciated bodies.\r\n\r\n\"'Take off your silken clothes,' said the devil to the priest, 'put\r\non your ankles heavy chains such as these unfortunates wear; lie down\r\non the cold and filthy floor--and then talk to them about a hell that\r\nstill awaits them!'\r\n\r\n\"'No, no!' answered the priest, 'I cannot think of anything more\r\ndreadful than this.  I entreat you, let me go away from here!'\r\n\r\n\"'Yes, this is hell.  There can be no worse hell than this.  Did you\r\nnot know it?  Did you not know that these men and women whom you are\r\nfrightening with the picture of a hell hereafter--did you not know\r\nthat they are in hell right here, before they die?'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was written fifty years ago in dark Russia, on the wall of one\r\nof the most horrible prisons.  Yet who can deny that the same applies\r\nwith equal force to the present time, even to American prisons?\r\n\r\nWith all our boasted reforms, our great social changes, and our\r\nfar-reaching discoveries, human beings continue to be sent to the\r\nworst of hells, wherein they are outraged, degraded, and tortured,\r\nthat society may be \"protected\" from the phantoms of its own making.\r\n\r\nPrison, a social protection?  What monstrous mind ever conceived such\r\nan idea?  Just as well say that health can be promoted by a\r\nwidespread contagion.\r\n\r\nAfter eighteen months of horror in an English prison, Oscar Wilde\r\ngave to the world his great masterpiece, THE BALLAD OF READING GOAL:\r\n\r\n          The vilest deeds, like poison weeds,\r\n            Bloom well in prison air;\r\n          It is only what is good in Man\r\n            That wastes and withers there.\r\n          Pale Anguish keeps the heavy gate,\r\n            And the Warder is Despair.\r\n\r\nSociety goes on perpetuating this poisonous air, not realizing that\r\nout of it can come naught but the most poisonous results.\r\n\r\nWe are spending at the present $3,500,000 per day, $1,000,095,000 per\r\nyear, to maintain prison institutions, and that in a democratic\r\ncountry,--a sum almost as large as the combined output of wheat,\r\nvalued at $750,000,000, and the output of coal, valued at\r\n$350,000,000.  Professor Bushnell of Washington, D.C., estimates the\r\ncost of prisons at $6,000,000,000 annually, and Dr. G. Frank Lydston,\r\nan eminent American writer on crime, gives $5,000,000,000 annually as\r\na reasonable figure.  Such unheard-of expenditure for the purpose of\r\nmaintaining vast armies of human beings caged up like wild beasts![1]\r\n\r\nYet crimes are on the increase.  Thus we learn that in America there\r\nare four and a half times as many crimes to every million population\r\ntoday as there were twenty years ago.\r\n\r\nThe most horrible aspect is that our national crime is murder, not\r\nrobbery, embezzlement, or rape, as in the South.  London is five\r\ntimes as large as Chicago, yet there are one hundred and eighteen\r\nmurders annually in the latter city, while only twenty in London.\r\nNor is Chicago the leading city in crime, since it is only seventh on\r\nthe list, which is headed by four Southern cities, and San Francisco\r\nand Los Angeles.  In view of such a terrible condition of affairs, it\r\nseems ridiculous to prate of the protection society derives from its\r\nprisons.\r\n\r\nThe average mind is slow in grasping a truth, but when the most\r\nthoroughly organized, centralized institution, maintained at an\r\nexcessive national expense, has proven a complete social failure, the\r\ndullest must begin to question its right to exist.  The time is past\r\nwhen we can be content with our social fabric merely because it is\r\n\"ordained by divine right,\" or by the majesty of the law.\r\n\r\nThe widespread prison investigations, agitation, and education during\r\nthe last few years are conclusive proof that men are learning to dig\r\ndeep into the very bottom of society, down to the causes of the\r\nterrible discrepancy between social and individual life.\r\n\r\nWhy, then, are prisons a social crime and a failure?  To answer this\r\nvital question it behooves us to seek the nature and cause of crimes,\r\nthe methods employed in coping with them, and the effects these\r\nmethods produce in ridding society of the curse and horror of crimes.\r\n\r\nFirst, as to the NATURE of crime:\r\n\r\nHavelock Ellis divides crime into four phases, the political, the\r\npassional, the insane, and the occasional.  He says that the\r\npolitical criminal is the victim of an attempt of a more or less\r\ndespotic government to preserve its own stability.  He is not\r\nnecessarily guilty of an unsocial offense; he simply tries to\r\noverturn a certain political order which may itself be anti-social.\r\nThis truth is recognized all over the world, except in America where\r\nthe foolish notion still prevails that in a Democracy there is no\r\nplace for political criminals.  Yet John Brown was a political\r\ncriminal; so were the Chicago Anarchists; so is every striker.\r\nConsequently, says Havelock Ellis, the political criminal of our time\r\nor place may be the hero, martyr, saint of another age.  Lombroso\r\ncalls the political criminal the true precursor of the progressive\r\nmovement of humanity.\r\n\r\n\"The criminal by passion is usually a man of wholesome birth and\r\nhonest life, who under the stress of some great, unmerited wrong has\r\nwrought justice for himself.\"[2]\r\n\r\nMr. Hugh C. Weir, in THE MENACE OF THE POLICE, cites the case of Jim\r\nFlaherty, a criminal by passion, who, instead of being saved by\r\nsociety, is turned into a drunkard and a recidivist, with a ruined\r\nand poverty-stricken family as the result.\r\n\r\nA more pathetic type is Archie, the victim in Brand Whitlock's novel,\r\nTHE TURN OF THE BALANCE, the greatest American expose of crime in the\r\nmaking.  Archie, even more than Flaherty, was driven to crime and\r\ndeath by the cruel inhumanity of his surroundings, and by the\r\nunscrupulous hounding of the machinery of the law.  Archie and\r\nFlaherty are but the types of many thousands, demonstrating how the\r\nlegal aspects of crime, and the methods of dealing with it, help to\r\ncreate the disease which is undermining our entire social life.\r\n\r\n\"The insane criminal really can no more be considered a criminal than\r\na child, since he is mentally in the same condition as an infant or\r\nan animal.\"[3]\r\n\r\nThe law already recognizes that, but only in rare cases of a very\r\nflagrant nature, or when the culprit's wealth permits the luxury of\r\ncriminal insanity.  It has become quite fashionable to be the victim\r\nof paranoia.  But on the whole the \"sovereignty of justice\" still\r\ncontinues to punish criminally insane with the whole severity of its\r\npower.  Thus Mr. Ellis quotes from Dr. Richter's statistics showing\r\nthat in Germany, one hundred and six madmen, out of one hundred and\r\nforty-four criminal insane, were condemned to severe punishment.\r\n\r\nThe occasional criminal \"represents by far the largest class of our\r\nprison population, hence is the greatest menace to social\r\nwell-being.\"  What is the cause that compels a vast army of the human\r\nfamily to take to crime, to prefer the hideous life within prison\r\nwalls to the life outside?  Certainly that cause must be an iron\r\nmaster, who leaves its victims no avenue of escape, for the most\r\ndepraved human being loves liberty.\r\n\r\nThis terrific force is conditioned in our cruel social and economic\r\narrangement.  I do not mean to deny the biologic, physiologic, or\r\npsychologic factors in creating crime; but there is hardly an\r\nadvanced criminologist who will not concede that the social and\r\neconomic influences are the most relentless, the most poisonous germs\r\nof crime.  Granted even that there are innate criminal tendencies, it\r\nis none the less true that these tendencies find rich nutrition in\r\nour social environment.\r\n\r\nThere is close relation, says Havelock Ellis, between crimes against\r\nthe person and the price of alcohol, between crimes against property\r\nand the price of wheat.  He quotes Quetelet and Lacassagne, the\r\nformer looking upon society as the preparer of crime, and the\r\ncriminals as instruments that execute them.  The latter find that\r\n\"the social environment is the cultivation medium of criminality;\r\nthat the criminal is the microbe, an element which only becomes\r\nimportant when it finds the medium which causes it to ferment; EVERY\r\nSOCIETY HAS THE CRIMINALS IT DESERVES.\"[4]\r\n\r\nThe most \"prosperous\" industrial period makes it impossible for the\r\nworker to earn enough to keep up health and vigor.  And as prosperity\r\nis, at best, an imaginary condition, thousands of people are\r\nconstantly added to the host of the unemployed.  From East to West,\r\nfrom South to North, this vast army tramps in search of work or food,\r\nand all they find is the workhouse or the slums.  Those who have a\r\nspark of self-respect left, prefer open defiance, prefer crime to the\r\nemaciated, degraded position of poverty.\r\n\r\nEdward Carpenter estimates that five-sixths of indictable crimes\r\nconsist in some violation of property rights; but that is too low a\r\nfigure.  A thorough investigation would prove that nine crimes out of\r\nten could be traced, directly or indirectly, to our economic and\r\nsocial iniquities, to our system of remorseless exploitation and\r\nrobbery.  There is no criminal so stupid but recognizes this terrible\r\nfact, though he may not be able to account for it.\r\n\r\nA collection of criminal philosophy, which Havelock Ellis, Lombroso,\r\nand other eminent men have compiled, shows that the criminal feels\r\nonly too keenly that it is society that drives him to crime.  A\r\nMilanese thief said to Lombroso: \"I do not rob, I merely take from\r\nthe rich their superfluities; besides, do not advocates and merchants\r\nrob?\"  A murderer wrote: \"Knowing that three-fourths of the social\r\nvirtues are cowardly vices, I thought an open assault on a rich man\r\nwould be less ignoble than the cautious combination of fraud.\"\r\nAnother wrote: \"I am imprisoned for stealing a half dozen eggs.\r\nMinisters who rob millions are honored.  Poor Italy!\" An educated\r\nconvict said to Mr. Davitt: \"The laws of society are framed for the\r\npurpose of securing the wealth of the world to power and calculation,\r\nthereby depriving the larger portion of mankind of its rights and\r\nchances.  Why should they punish me for taking by somewhat similar\r\nmeans from those who have taken more than they had a right to?\"  The\r\nsame man added: \"Religion robs the soul of its independence;\r\npatriotism is the stupid worship of the world for which the\r\nwell-being and the peace of the inhabitants were sacrificed by those\r\nwho profit by it, while the laws of the land, in restraining natural\r\ndesires, were waging war on the manifest spirit of the law of our\r\nbeings.  Compared with this,\" he concluded, \"thieving is an honorable\r\npursuit.\"[5]\r\n\r\nVerily, there is greater truth in this philosophy than in all the\r\nlaw-and-moral books of society.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe economic, political, moral, and physical factors being the\r\nmicrobes of crime, how does society meet the situation?\r\n\r\nThe methods of coping with crime have no doubt undergone several\r\nchanges, but mainly in a theoretic sense.  In practice, society has\r\nretained the primitive motive in dealing with the offender; that is,\r\nrevenge.  It has also adopted the theologic idea; namely, punishment;\r\nwhile the legal and \"civilized\" methods consist of deterrence or\r\nterror, and reform.  We shall presently see that all four modes have\r\nfailed utterly, and that we are today no nearer a solution than in\r\nthe dark ages.\r\n\r\nThe natural impulse of the primitive man to strike back, to avenge a\r\nwrong, is out of date.  Instead, the civilized man, stripped of\r\ncourage and daring, has delegated to an organized machinery the duty\r\nof avenging his wrongs, in the foolish belief that the State is\r\njustified in doing what he no longer has the manhood or consistency\r\nto do.  The majesty-of-the-law is a reasoning thing; it would not\r\nstoop to primitive instincts.  Its mission is of a \"higher\" nature.\r\nTrue, it is still steeped in the theologic muddle, which proclaims\r\npunishment as a means of purification, or the vicarious atonement of\r\nsin.  But legally and socially the statute exercises punishment, not\r\nmerely as an infliction of pain upon the offender, but also for its\r\nterrifying effect upon others.\r\n\r\nWhat is the real basis of punishment, however?  The notion of a free\r\nwill, the idea that man is at all times a free agent for good or\r\nevil; if he chooses the latter, he must be made to pay the price.\r\nAlthough this theory has long been exploded, and thrown upon the\r\ndustheap, it continues to be applied daily by the entire machinery of\r\ngovernment, turning it into the most cruel and brutal tormentor of\r\nhuman life.  The only reason for its continuance is the still more\r\ncruel notion that the greater the terror punishment spreads, the more\r\ncertain its preventative effect.\r\n\r\nSociety is using the most drastic methods in dealing with the social\r\noffender.  Why do they not deter?  Although in America a man is\r\nsupposed to be considered innocent until proven guilty, the\r\ninstruments of law, the police, carry on a reign of terror, making\r\nindiscriminate arrests, beating, clubbing, bullying people, using the\r\nbarbarous method of the \"third degree,\" subjecting their unfortunate\r\nvictims to the foul air of the station house, and the still fouler\r\nlanguage of its guardians.  Yet crimes are rapidly multiplying, and\r\nsociety is paying the price.  On the other hand, it is an open secret\r\nthat when the unfortunate citizen has been given the full \"mercy\" of\r\nthe law, and for the sake of safety is hidden in the worst of hells,\r\nhis real Calvary begins.  Robbed of his rights as a human being,\r\ndegraded to a mere automaton without will or feeling, dependent\r\nentirely upon the mercy of brutal keepers, he daily goes through a\r\nprocess of dehumanization, compared with which savage revenge was\r\nmere child's play.\r\n\r\nThere is not a single penal institution or reformatory in the United\r\nStates where men are not tortured \"to be made good,\" by means of the\r\nblackjack, the club, the straightjacket, the water-cure, the \"humming\r\nbird\" (an electrical contrivance run along the human body), the\r\nsolitary, the bullring, and starvation diet.  In these institutions\r\nhis will is broken, his soul degraded, his spirit subdued by the\r\ndeadly monotony and routine of prison life.  In Ohio, Illinois,\r\nPennsylvania, Missouri, and in the South, these horrors have become\r\nso flagrant as to reach the outside world, while in most other\r\nprisons the same Christian methods still prevail.  But prison walls\r\nrarely allow the agonized shrieks of the victims to escape--prison\r\nwalls are thick, they dull the sound.  Society might with greater\r\nimmunity abolish all prisons at once, than to hope for protection\r\nfrom these twentieth century chambers of horrors.\r\n\r\nYear after year the gates of prison hells return to the world an\r\nemaciated, deformed, willless, ship-wrecked crew of humanity, with\r\nthe Cain mark on their foreheads, their hopes crushed, all their\r\nnatural inclinations thwarted.  With nothing but hunger and\r\ninhumanity to greet them, these victims soon sink back into crime as\r\nthe only possibility of existence.  It is not at all an unusual thing\r\nto find men and women who have spent half their lives--nay, almost\r\ntheir entire existence--in prison.  I know a woman on Blackwell's\r\nIsland, who had been in and out thirty-eight times; and through a\r\nfriend I learn that a young boy of seventeen, whom he had nursed and\r\ncared for in the Pittsburg penitentiary, had never known the meaning\r\nof liberty.  From the reformatory to the penitentiary had been the\r\npath of this boy's life, until, broken in body, he died a victim of\r\nsocial revenge.  These personal experiences are substantiated by\r\nextensive data giving overwhelming proof of the utter futility of\r\nprisons as a means of deterrence or reform.\r\n\r\nWell-meaning persons are now working for a new departure in the\r\nprison question,--reclamation, to restore once more to the prisoner\r\nthe possibility of becoming a human being.  Commendable as this is, I\r\nfear it is impossible to hope for good results from pouring good wine\r\ninto a musty bottle.  Nothing short of a complete reconstruction of\r\nsociety will deliver mankind from the cancer of crime.  Still, if the\r\ndull edge of our social conscience would be sharpened, the penal\r\ninstitutions might be given a new coat of varnish.  But the first\r\nstep to be taken is the renovation of the social consciousness, which\r\nis in a rather dilapidated condition.  It is sadly in need to be\r\nawakened to the fact that crime is a question of degree, that we all\r\nhave the rudiments of crime in us, more or less, according to our\r\nmental, physical, and social environment; and that the individual\r\ncriminal is merely a reflex of the tendencies of the aggregate.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the social consciousness awakened, the average individual may\r\nlearn to refuse the \"honor\" of being the bloodhound of the law.  He\r\nmay cease to persecute, despise, and mistrust the social offender,\r\nand give him a chance to live and breathe among his fellows.\r\nInstitutions are, of course, harder to reach.  They are cold,\r\nimpenetrable, and cruel; still, with the social consciousness\r\nquickened, it might be possible to free the prison victims from the\r\nbrutality of prison officials, guards, and keepers.  Public opinion\r\nis a powerful weapon; keepers of human prey, even, are afraid of it.\r\nThey may be taught a little humanity, especially if they realize that\r\ntheir jobs depend upon it.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the most important step is to demand for the prisoner the right\r\nto work while in prison, with some monetary recompense that would\r\nenable him to lay aside a little for the day of his release, the\r\nbeginning of a new life.\r\n\r\nIt is almost ridiculous to hope much from present society when we\r\nconsider that workingmen, wage slaves themselves, object to convict\r\nlabor.  I shall not go into the cruelty of this objection, but merely\r\nconsider the impracticability of it.  To begin with, the opposition\r\nso far raised by organized labor has been directed against windmills.\r\nPrisoners have always worked; only the State has been their\r\nexploiter, even as the individual employer has been the robber of\r\norganized labor.  The States have either set the convicts to work for\r\nthe government, or they have farmed convict labor to private\r\nindividuals.  Twenty-nine of the States pursue the latter plan.  The\r\nFederal government and seventeen States have discarded it, as have\r\nthe leading nations of Europe, since it leads to hideous overworking\r\nand abuse of prisoners, and to endless graft.\r\n\r\nRhode Island, the State dominated by Aldrich, offers perhaps the\r\nworst example.  Under a five-year contract, dated July 7th, 1906, and\r\nrenewable for five years more at the option of private contractors,\r\nthe labor of the inmates of the Rhode Island Penitentiary and the\r\nProvidence County Jail is sold to the Reliance-Sterling Mfg. Co. at\r\nthe rate of a trifle less than 25 cents a day per man.  This Company\r\nis really a gigantic Prison Labor Trust, for it also leases the\r\nconvict labor of Connecticut, Michigan, Indiana, Nebraska, and South\r\nDakota penitentiaries, and the reformatories of New Jersey, Indiana,\r\nIllinois, and Wisconsin, eleven establishments in all.\r\n\r\nThe enormity of the graft under the Rhode Island contract may be\r\nestimated from the fact that this same Company pays 62 1/2 cents a\r\nday in Nebraska for the convict's labor, and that Tennessee, for\r\nexample, gets $1.10 a day for a convict's work from the Gray-Dudley\r\nHardware Co.; Missouri gets 70 cents a day from the Star Overall Mfg.\r\nCo.; West Virginia 65 cents a day from the Kraft Mfg. Co., and\r\nMaryland 55 cents a day from Oppenheim, Oberndorf & Co., shirt\r\nmanufacturers.  The very difference in prices points to enormous\r\ngraft.  For example, the Reliance-Sterling Mfg. Co. manufactures\r\nshirts, the cost of free labor being not less than $1.20 per dozen,\r\nwhile it pays Rhode Island thirty cents a dozen.  Furthermore, the\r\nState charges this Trust no rent for the use of its huge factory,\r\ncharges nothing for power, heat, light, or even drainage, and exacts\r\nno taxes.  What graft!\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that more than twelve million dollars' worth of\r\nworkingmen's shirts and overalls is produced annually in this country\r\nby prison labor.  It is a woman's industry, and the first reflection\r\nthat arises is that an immense amount of free female labor is thus\r\ndisplaced.  The second consideration is that male convicts, who\r\nshould be learning trades that would give them some chance of being\r\nself-supporting after their release, are kept at this work at which\r\nthey can not possibly make a dollar.  This is the more serious when\r\nwe consider that much of this labor is done in reformatories, which\r\nso loudly profess to be training their inmates to become useful\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\nThe third, and most important, consideration is that the enormous\r\nprofits thus wrung from convict labor are a constant incentive to the\r\ncontractors to exact from their unhappy victims tasks altogether\r\nbeyond their strength, and to punish them cruelly when their work\r\ndoes not come up to the excessive demands made.\r\n\r\nAnother word on the condemnation of convicts to tasks at which they\r\ncannot hope to make a living after release.  Indiana, for example, is\r\na State that has made a great splurge over being in the front rank of\r\nmodern penological improvements.  Yet, according to the report\r\nrendered in 1908 by the training school of its \"reformatory,\" 135\r\nwere engaged in the manufacture of chains, 207 in that of shirts, and\r\n255 in the foundry--a total of 597 in three occupations.  But at this\r\nso-called reformatory 59 occupations were represented by the inmates,\r\n39 of which were connected with country pursuits.  Indiana, like\r\nother States, professes to be training the inmates of her reformatory\r\nto occupations by which they will be able to make their living when\r\nreleased.  She actually sets them to work making chains, shirts, and\r\nbrooms, the latter for the benefit of the Louisville Fancy Grocery\r\nCo.  Broom making is a trade largely monopolized by the blind, shirt\r\nmaking is done by women, and there is only one free chain factory in\r\nthe State, and at that a released convict can not hope to get\r\nemployment.  The whole thing is a cruel farce.\r\n\r\nIf, then, the States can be instrumental in robbing their helpless\r\nvictims of such tremendous profits, is it not high time for organized\r\nlabor to stop its idle howl, and to insist on decent remuneration for\r\nthe convict, even as labor organizations claim for themselves?  In\r\nthat way workingmen would kill the germ which makes of the prisoner\r\nan enemy to the interests of labor.  I have said elsewhere that\r\nthousands of convicts, incompetent and without a trade, without means\r\nof subsistence, are yearly turned back into the social fold.  These\r\nmen and women must live, for even an ex-convict has needs.  Prison\r\nlife has made them anti-social beings, and the rigidly closed doors\r\nthat meet them on their release are not likely to decrease their\r\nbitterness.  The inevitable result is that they form a favorable\r\nnucleus out of which scabs, blacklegs, detectives, and policemen are\r\ndrawn, only too willing to do the master's bidding.  Thus organized\r\nlabor, by its foolish opposition to work in prison, defeats its own\r\nends.  It helps to create poisonous fumes that stifle every attempt\r\nfor economic betterment.  If the workingman wants to avoid these\r\neffects, he should INSIST on the right of the convict to work, he\r\nshould meet him as a brother, take him into his organization, and\r\nWITH HIS AID TURN AGAINST THE SYSTEM WHICH GRINDS THEM BOTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nLast, but not least, is the growing realization of the barbarity and\r\nthe inadequacy of the definite sentence.  Those who believe in, and\r\nearnestly aim at, a change are fast coming to the conclusion that man\r\nmust be given an opportunity to make good.  And how is he to do it\r\nwith ten, fifteen, or twenty years' imprisonment before him?  The\r\nhope of liberty and of opportunity is the only incentive to life,\r\nespecially the prisoner's life.  Society has sinned so long against\r\nhim--it ought at least to leave him that.  I am not very sanguine\r\nthat it will, or that any real change in that direction can take\r\nplace until the conditions that breed both the prisoner and the\r\njailer will be forever abolished.\r\n\r\n     Out of his mouth a red, red rose!\r\n     Out of his heart a white!\r\n     For who can say by what strange way\r\n     Christ brings his will to light,\r\n     Since the barren staff the pilgrim bore\r\n     Bloomed in the great Pope's sight.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] CRIME AND CRIMINALS.  W. C. Owen.\r\n\r\n[2] THE CRIMINAL, Havelock Ellis.\r\n\r\n[3] THE CRIMINAL.\r\n\r\n[4] THE CRIMINAL.\r\n\r\n[5] THE CRIMINAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPATRIOTISM: A MENACE TO LIBERTY\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is patriotism?  Is it love of one's birthplace, the place of\r\nchildhood's recollections and hopes, dreams and aspirations?  Is it\r\nthe place where, in childlike naivety, we would watch the fleeting\r\nclouds, and wonder why we, too, could not run so swiftly?  The place\r\nwhere we would count the milliard glittering stars, terror-stricken\r\nlest each one \"an eye should be,\" piercing the very depths of our\r\nlittle souls?  Is it the place where we would listen to the music of\r\nthe birds, and long to have wings to fly, even as they, to distant\r\nlands?  Or the place where we would sit at mother's knee, enraptured\r\nby wonderful tales of great deeds and conquests?  In short, is it\r\nlove for the spot, every inch representing dear and precious\r\nrecollections of a happy, joyous, and playful childhood?\r\n\r\nIf that were patriotism, few American men of today could be called\r\nupon to be patriotic, since the place of play has been turned into\r\nfactory, mill, and mine, while deafening sounds of machinery have\r\nreplaced the music of the birds.  Nor can we longer hear the tales of\r\ngreat deeds, for the stories our mothers tell today are but those of\r\nsorrow, tears, and grief.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is patriotism?  \"Patriotism, sir, is the last resort of\r\nscoundrels,\" said Dr. Johnson.  Leo Tolstoy, the greatest\r\nanti-patriot of our times, defines patriotism as the principle that\r\nwill justify the training of wholesale murderers; a trade that\r\nrequires better equipment for the exercise of man-killing than the\r\nmaking of such necessities of life as shoes, clothing, and houses; a\r\ntrade that guarantees better returns and greater glory than that of\r\nthe average workingman.\r\n\r\nGustave Herve, another great anti-patriot, justly calls patriotism a\r\nsuperstition--one far more injurious, brutal, and inhumane than\r\nreligion.  The superstition of religion originated in man's inability\r\nto explain natural phenomena.  That is, when primitive man heard\r\nthunder or saw the lightning, he could not account for either, and\r\ntherefore concluded that back of them must be a force greater than\r\nhimself.  Similarly he saw a supernatural force in the rain, and in\r\nthe various other changes in nature.  Patriotism, on the other hand,\r\nis a superstition artificially created and maintained through a\r\nnetwork of lies and falsehoods; a superstition that robs man of his\r\nself-respect and dignity, and increases his arrogance and conceit.\r\n\r\nIndeed, conceit, arrogance, and egotism are the essentials of\r\npatriotism.  Let me illustrate.  Patriotism assumes that our globe is\r\ndivided into little spots, each one surrounded by an iron gate.\r\nThose who have had the fortune of being born on some particular spot,\r\nconsider themselves better, nobler, grander, more intelligent than\r\nthe living beings inhabiting any other spot.  It is, therefore, the\r\nduty of everyone living on that chosen spot to fight, kill, and die\r\nin the attempt to impose his superiority upon all the others.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of the other spots reason in like manner, of course,\r\nwith the result that, from early infancy, the mind of the child is\r\npoisoned with blood-curdling stories about the Germans, the French,\r\nthe Italians, Russians, etc.  When the child has reached manhood, he\r\nis thoroughly saturated with the belief that he is chosen by the Lord\r\nhimself to defend HIS country against the attack or invasion of any\r\nforeigner.  It is for that purpose that we are clamoring for a\r\ngreater army and navy, more battleships and ammunition.  It is for\r\nthat purpose that America has within a short time spent four hundred\r\nmillion dollars.  Just think of it--four hundred million dollars\r\ntaken from the produce of the PEOPLE.  For surely it is not the rich\r\nwho contribute to patriotism.  They are cosmopolitans, perfectly at\r\nhome in every land.  We in America know well the truth of this.  Are\r\nnot our rich Americans Frenchmen in France, Germans in Germany, or\r\nEnglishmen in England?  And do they not squander with cosmopolitan\r\ngrace fortunes coined by American factory children and cotton slaves?\r\nYes, theirs is the patriotism that will make it possible to send\r\nmessages of condolence to a despot like the Russian Tsar, when any\r\nmishap befalls him, as President Roosevelt did in the name of HIS\r\npeople, when Sergius was punished by the Russian revolutionists.\r\n\r\nIt is a patriotism that will assist the arch-murderer, Diaz, in\r\ndestroying thousands of lives in Mexico, or that will even aid in\r\narresting Mexican revolutionists on American soil and keep them\r\nincarcerated in American prisons, without the slightest cause or\r\nreason.\r\n\r\nBut, then, patriotism is not for those who represent wealth and\r\npower.  It is good enough for the people.  It reminds one of the\r\nhistoric wisdom of Frederic the Great, the bosom friend of Voltaire,\r\nwho said: \"Religion is a fraud, but it must be maintained for the\r\nmasses.\"\r\n\r\nThat patriotism is rather a costly institution, no one will doubt\r\nafter considering the following statistics.  The progressive increase\r\nof the expenditures for the leading armies and navies of the world\r\nduring the last quarter of a century is a fact of such gravity as to\r\nstartle every thoughtful student of economic problems.  It may be\r\nbriefly indicated by dividing the time from 1881 to 1905 into\r\nfive-year periods, and noting the disbursements of several great\r\nnations for army and navy purposes during the first and last of those\r\nperiods.  From the first to the last of the periods noted the\r\nexpenditures of Great Britain increased from $2,101,848,936 to\r\n$4,143,226,885, those of France from $3,324,500,000 to\r\n$3,455,109,900, those of Germany from $725,000,200 to $2,700,375,600,\r\nthose of the United States from $1,275,500,750 to $2,650,900,450,\r\nthose of Russia from $1,900,975,500 to $5,250,445,100, those of Italy\r\nfrom $1,600,975,750 to $1,755,500,100, and those of Japan from\r\n$182,900,500 to $700,925,475.\r\n\r\nThe military expenditures of each of the nations mentioned increased\r\nin each of the five-year periods under review.  During the entire\r\ninterval from 1881 to 1905 Great Britain's outlay for her army\r\nincreased fourfold, that of the United States was tripled, Russia's\r\nwas doubled, that of Germany increased 35 per cent., that of France\r\nabout 15 per cent., and that of Japan nearly 500 per cent.  If we\r\ncompare the expenditures of these nations upon their armies with\r\ntheir total expenditures for all the twenty-five years ending with\r\n1905, the proportion rose as follows:\r\n\r\nIn Great Britain from 20 per cent. to 37; in the United States from\r\n15 to 23; in France from 16 to 18; in Italy from 12 to 15; in Japan\r\nfrom 12 to 14.  On the other hand, it is interesting to note that the\r\nproportion in Germany decreased from about 58 per cent. to 25, the\r\ndecrease being due to the enormous increase in the imperial\r\nexpenditures for other purposes, the fact being that the army\r\nexpenditures for the period of 1901-5 were higher than for any\r\nfive-year period preceding.  Statistics show that the countries in\r\nwhich army expenditures are greatest, in proportion to the total\r\nnational revenues, are Great Britain, the United States, Japan,\r\nFrance, and Italy, in the order named.\r\n\r\nThe showing as to the cost of great navies is equally impressive.\r\nDuring the twenty-five years ending with 1905 naval expenditures\r\nincreased approximately as follows: Great Britain, 300 per cent.;\r\nFrance 60 per cent.; Germany 600 per cent.; the United States 525 per\r\ncent.; Russia 300 per cent.; Italy 250 per cent.; and Japan, 700 per\r\ncent.  With the exception of Great Britain, the United States spends\r\nmore for naval purposes than any other nation, and this expenditure\r\nbears also a larger proportion to the entire national disbursements\r\nthan that of any other power.  In the period 1881-5, the expenditure\r\nfor the United States navy was $6.20 out of each $100 appropriated\r\nfor all national purposes; the amount rose to $6.60 for the next\r\nfive-year period, to $8.10 for the next, to $11.70 for the next, and\r\nto $16.40 for 1901-5.  It is morally certain that the outlay for the\r\ncurrent period of five years will show a still further increase.\r\n\r\nThe rising cost of militarism may be still further illustrated by\r\ncomputing it as a per capita tax on population.  From the first to\r\nthe last of the five-year periods taken as the basis for the\r\ncomparisons here given, it has risen as follows: In Great Britain,\r\nfrom $18.47 to $52.50; in France, from $19.66 to $23.62; in Germany,\r\nfrom $10.17 to $15.51; in the United States, from $5.62 to $13.64; in\r\nRussia, from $6.14 to $8.37; in Italy, from $9.59 to $11.24, and in\r\nJapan from 86 cents to $3.11.\r\n\r\nIt is in connection with this rough estimate of cost per capita that\r\nthe economic burden of militarism is most appreciable.  The\r\nirresistible conclusion from available data is that the increase of\r\nexpenditure for army and navy purposes is rapidly surpassing the\r\ngrowth of population in each of the countries considered in the\r\npresent calculation.  In other words, a continuation of the increased\r\ndemands of militarism threatens each of those nations with a\r\nprogressive exhaustion both of men and resources.\r\n\r\nThe awful waste that patriotism necessitates ought to be sufficient\r\nto cure the man of even average intelligence from this disease.  Yet\r\npatriotism demands still more.  The people are urged to be patriotic\r\nand for that luxury they pay, not only by supporting their\r\n\"defenders,\" but even by sacrificing their own children.  Patriotism\r\nrequires allegiance to the flag, which means obedience and readiness\r\nto kill father, mother, brother, sister.\r\n\r\nThe usual contention is that we need a standing army to protect the\r\ncountry from foreign invasion.  Every intelligent man and woman\r\nknows, however, that this is a myth maintained to frighten and coerce\r\nthe foolish.  The governments of the world, knowing each other's\r\ninterests, do not invade each other.  They have learned that they can\r\ngain much more by international arbitration of disputes than by war\r\nand conquest.  Indeed, as Carlyle said, \"War is a quarrel between two\r\nthieves too cowardly to fight their own battle; therefore they take\r\nboys from one village and another village; stick them into uniforms,\r\nequip them with guns, and let them loose like wild beasts against\r\neach other.\"\r\n\r\nIt does not require much wisdom to trace every war back to a similar\r\ncause.  Let us take our own Spanish-American war, supposedly a great\r\nand patriotic event in the history of the United States.  How our\r\nhearts burned with indignation against the atrocious Spaniards!\r\nTrue, our indignation did not flare up spontaneously.  It was\r\nnurtured by months of newspaper agitation, and long after Butcher\r\nWeyler had killed off many noble Cubans and outraged many Cuban\r\nwomen.  Still, in justice to the American Nation be it said, it did\r\ngrow indignant and was willing to fight, and that it fought bravely.\r\nBut when the smoke was over, the dead buried, and the cost of the war\r\ncame back to the people in an increase in the price of commodities\r\nand rent--that is, when we sobered up from our patriotic spree--it\r\nsuddenly dawned on us that the cause of the Spanish-American war was\r\nthe consideration of the price of sugar; or, to be more explicit,\r\nthat the lives, blood, and money of the American people were used to\r\nprotect the interests of American capitalists, which were threatened\r\nby the Spanish government.  That this is not an exaggeration, but is\r\nbased on absolute facts and figures, is best proven by the attitude\r\nof the American government to Cuban labor.  When Cuba was firmly in\r\nthe clutches of the United States, the very soldiers sent to liberate\r\nCuba were ordered to shoot Cuban workingmen during the great\r\ncigarmakers' strike, which took place shortly after the war.\r\n\r\nNor do we stand alone in waging war for such causes.  The curtain is\r\nbeginning to be lifted on the motives of the terrible Russo-Japanese\r\nwar, which cost so much blood and tears.  And we see again that back\r\nof the fierce Moloch of war stands the still fiercer god of\r\nCommercialism.  Kuropatkin, the Russian Minister of War during the\r\nRusso-Japanese struggle, has revealed the true secret behind the\r\nlatter.  The Tsar and his Grand Dukes, having invested money in\r\nCorean concessions, the war was forced for the sole purpose of\r\nspeedily accumulating large fortunes.\r\n\r\nThe contention that a standing army and navy is the best security of\r\npeace is about as logical as the claim that the most peaceful citizen\r\nis he who goes about heavily armed.  The experience of every-day life\r\nfully proves that the armed individual is invariably anxious to try\r\nhis strength.  The same is historically true of governments.  Really\r\npeaceful countries do not waste life and energy in war preparations,\r\nwith the result that peace is maintained.\r\n\r\nHowever, the clamor for an increased army and navy is not due to any\r\nforeign danger.  It is owing to the dread of the growing discontent\r\nof the masses and of the international spirit among the workers.  It\r\nis to meet the internal enemy that the Powers of various countries\r\nare preparing themselves; an enemy, who, once awakened to\r\nconsciousness, will prove more dangerous than any foreign invader.\r\n\r\nThe powers that have for centuries been engaged in enslaving the\r\nmasses have made a thorough study of their psychology.  They know\r\nthat the people at large are like children whose despair, sorrow, and\r\ntears can be turned into joy with a little toy.  And the more\r\ngorgeously the toy is dressed, the louder the colors, the more it\r\nwill appeal to the million-headed child.\r\n\r\nAn army and navy represents the people's toys.  To make them more\r\nattractive and acceptable, hundreds and thousands of dollars are\r\nbeing spent for the display of these toys.  That was the purpose of\r\nthe American government in equipping a fleet and sending it along the\r\nPacific coast, that every American citizen should be made to feel the\r\npride and glory of the United States.  The city of San Francisco\r\nspent one hundred thousand dollars for the entertainment of the\r\nfleet; Los Angeles, sixty thousand; Seattle and Tacoma, about one\r\nhundred thousand.  To entertain the fleet, did I say?  To dine and\r\nwine a few superior officers, while the \"brave boys\" had to mutiny to\r\nget sufficient food.  Yes, two hundred and sixty thousand dollars\r\nwere spent on fireworks, theatre parties, and revelries, at a time\r\nwhen men, women, and children through the breadth and length of the\r\ncountry were starving in the streets; when thousands of unemployed\r\nwere ready to sell their labor at any price.\r\n\r\nTwo hundred and sixty thousand dollars!  What could not have been\r\naccomplished with such an enormous sum?  But instead of bread and\r\nshelter, the children of those cities were taken to see the fleet,\r\nthat it may remain, as one of the newspapers said, \"a lasting memory\r\nfor the child.\"\r\n\r\nA wonderful thing to remember, is it not?  The implements of\r\ncivilized slaughter.  If the mind of the child is to be poisoned with\r\nsuch memories, what hope is there for a true realization of human\r\nbrotherhood?\r\n\r\nWe Americans claim to be a peace-loving people.  We hate bloodshed;\r\nwe are opposed to violence.  Yet we go into spasms of joy over the\r\npossibility of projecting dynamite bombs from flying machines upon\r\nhelpless citizens.  We are ready to hang, electrocute, or lynch\r\nanyone, who, from economic necessity, will risk his own life in the\r\nattempt upon that of some industrial magnate.  Yet our hearts swell\r\nwith pride at the thought that America is becoming the most powerful\r\nnation on earth, and that it will eventually plant her iron foot on\r\nthe necks of all other nations.\r\n\r\nSuch is the logic of patriotism.\r\n\r\nConsidering the evil results that patriotism is fraught with for the\r\naverage man, it is as nothing compared with the insult and injury\r\nthat patriotism heaps upon the soldier himself,--that poor, deluded\r\nvictim of superstition and ignorance.  He, the savior of his country,\r\nthe protector of his nation,--what has patriotism in store for him?\r\nA life of slavish submission, vice, and perversion, during peace; a\r\nlife of danger, exposure, and death, during war.\r\n\r\nWhile on a recent lecture tour in San Francisco, I visited the\r\nPresidio, the most beautiful spot overlooking the Bay and Golden Gate\r\nPark.  Its purpose should have been playgrounds for children, gardens\r\nand music for the recreation of the weary.  Instead it is made ugly,\r\ndull, and gray by barracks,--barracks wherein the rich would not\r\nallow their dogs to dwell.  In these miserable shanties soldiers are\r\nherded like cattle; here they waste their young days, polishing the\r\nboots and brass buttons of their superior officers.  Here, too, I saw\r\nthe distinction of classes: sturdy sons of a free Republic, drawn up\r\nin line like convicts, saluting every passing shrimp of a lieutenant.\r\nAmerican equality, degrading manhood and elevating the uniform!\r\n\r\nBarrack life further tends to develop tendencies of sexual\r\nperversion.  It is gradually producing along this line results\r\nsimilar to European military conditions.  Havelock Ellis, the noted\r\nwriter on sex psychology, has made a thorough study of the subject.\r\nI quote: \"Some of the barracks are great centers of male\r\nprostitution....  The number of soldiers who prostitute themselves\r\nis greater than we are willing to believe.  It is no exaggeration to\r\nsay that in certain regiments the presumption is in favor of the\r\nvenality of the majority of the men....  On summer evenings Hyde\r\nPark and the neighborhood of Albert Gate are full of guardsmen and\r\nothers plying a lively trade, and with little disguise, in uniform or\r\nout....  In most cases the proceeds form a comfortable addition to\r\nTommy Atkins' pocket money.\"\r\n\r\nTo what extent this perversion has eaten its way into the army and\r\nnavy can best be judged from the fact that special houses exist for\r\nthis form of prostitution.  The practice is not limited to England;\r\nit is universal.  \"Soldiers are no less sought after in France than\r\nin England or in Germany, and special houses for military\r\nprostitution exist both in Paris and the garrison towns.\"\r\n\r\nHad Mr. Havelock Ellis included America in his investigation of sex\r\nperversion, he would have found that the same conditions prevail in\r\nour army and navy as in those of other countries.  The growth of the\r\nstanding army inevitably adds to the spread of sex perversion; the\r\nbarracks are the incubators.\r\n\r\nAside from the sexual effects of barrack life, it also tends to unfit\r\nthe soldier for useful labor after leaving the army.  Men, skilled in\r\na trade, seldom enter the army or navy, but even they, after a\r\nmilitary experience, find themselves totally unfitted for their\r\nformer occupations.  Having acquired habits of idleness and a taste\r\nfor excitement and adventure, no peaceful pursuit can content them.\r\nReleased from the army, they can turn to no useful work.  But it is\r\nusually the social riff-raff, discharged prisoners and the like, whom\r\neither the struggle for life or their own inclination drives into the\r\nranks.  These, their military term over, again turn to their former\r\nlife of crime, more brutalized and degraded than before.  It is a\r\nwell-known fact that in our prisons there is a goodly number of\r\nex-soldiers; while on the other hand, the army and navy are to a\r\ngreat extent supplied with ex-convicts.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all the evil results, I have just described, none seems to me so\r\ndetrimental to human integrity as the spirit patriotism has produced\r\nin the case of Private William Buwalda.  Because he foolishly\r\nbelieved that one can be a soldier and exercise his rights as a man\r\nat the same time, the military authorities punished him severely.\r\nTrue, he had served his country fifteen years, during which time his\r\nrecord was unimpeachable.  According to Gen. Funston, who reduced\r\nBuwalda's sentence to three years, \"the first duty of an officer or\r\nan enlisted man is unquestioned obedience and loyalty to the\r\ngovernment, and it makes no difference whether he approves of that\r\ngovernment or not.\"  Thus Funston stamps the true character of\r\nallegiance.  According to him, entrance into the army abrogates the\r\nprinciples of the Declaration of Independence.\r\n\r\nWhat a strange development of patriotism that turns a thinking being\r\ninto a loyal machine!\r\n\r\nIn justification of this most outrageous sentence of Buwalda, Gen.\r\nFunston tells the American people that the soldier's action was a\r\n\"serious crime equal to treason.\"  Now, what did this \"terrible\r\ncrime\" really consist of?  Simply in this: William Buwalda was one of\r\nfifteen hundred people who attended a public meeting in San\r\nFrancisco; and, oh, horrors, he shook hands with the speaker, Emma\r\nGoldman.  A terrible crime, indeed, which the General calls \"a great\r\nmilitary offense, infinitely worse than desertion.\"\r\n\r\nCan there be a greater indictment against patriotism than that it\r\nwill thus brand a man a criminal, throw him into prison, and rob him\r\nof the results of fifteen years of faithful service?\r\n\r\nBuwalda gave to his country the best years of his life and his very\r\nmanhood.  But all that was as nothing.  Patriotism is inexorable and,\r\nlike all insatiable monsters, demands all or nothing.  It does not\r\nadmit that a soldier is also a human being, who has a right to his\r\nown feelings and opinions, his own inclinations and ideas.  No,\r\npatriotism can not admit of that.  That is the lesson which Buwalda\r\nwas made to learn; made to learn at a rather costly, though not at a\r\nuseless, price.  When he returned to freedom, he had lost his\r\nposition in the army, but he regained his self-respect.  After all,\r\nthat is worth three years of imprisonment.\r\n\r\nA writer on the military conditions of America, in a recent article,\r\ncommented on the power of the military man over the civilian in\r\nGermany.  He said, among other things, that if our Republic had no\r\nother meaning than to guarantee all citizens equal rights, it would\r\nhave just cause for existence.  I am convinced that the writer was\r\nnot in Colorado during the patriotic regime of General Bell.  He\r\nprobably would have changed his mind had he seen how, in the name of\r\npatriotism and the Republic, men were thrown into bull-pens, dragged\r\nabout, driven across the border, and subjected to all kinds of\r\nindignities.  Nor is that Colorado incident the only one in the\r\ngrowth of military power in the United States.  There is hardly a\r\nstrike where troops and militia do not come to the rescue of those in\r\npower, and where they do not act as arrogantly and brutally as do the\r\nmen wearing the Kaiser's uniform.  Then, too, we have the Dick\r\nmilitary law.  Had the writer forgotten that?\r\n\r\nA great misfortune with most of our writers is that they are\r\nabsolutely ignorant on current events, or that, lacking honesty, they\r\nwill not speak of these matters.  And so it has come to pass that the\r\nDick military law was rushed through Congress with little discussion\r\nand still less publicity,--a law which gives the President the power\r\nto turn a peaceful citizen into a bloodthirsty man-killer, supposedly\r\nfor the defense of the country, in reality for the protection of the\r\ninterests of that particular party whose mouthpiece the President\r\nhappens to be.\r\n\r\nOur writer claims that militarism can never become such a power in\r\nAmerica as abroad, since it is voluntary with us, while compulsory in\r\nthe Old World.  Two very important facts, however, the gentleman\r\nforgets to consider.  First, that conscription has created in Europe\r\na deep-seated hatred of militarism among all classes of society.\r\nThousands of young recruits enlist under protest and, once in the\r\narmy, they will use every possible means to desert.  Second, that it\r\nis the compulsory feature of militarism which has created a\r\ntremendous anti-militarist movement, feared by European Powers far\r\nmore than anything else.  After all, the greatest bulwark of\r\ncapitalism is militarism.  The very moment the latter is undermined,\r\ncapitalism will totter.  True, we have no conscription; that is, men\r\nare not usually forced to enlist in the army, but we have developed a\r\nfar more exacting and rigid force--necessity.  Is it not a fact that\r\nduring industrial depressions there is a tremendous increase in the\r\nnumber of enlistments?  The trade of militarism may not be either\r\nlucrative or honorable, but it is better than tramping the country in\r\nsearch of work, standing in the bread line, or sleeping in municipal\r\nlodging houses.  After all, it means thirteen dollars per month,\r\nthree meals a day, and a place to sleep.  Yet even necessity is not\r\nsufficiently strong a factor to bring into the army an element of\r\ncharacter and manhood.  No wonder our military authorities complain\r\nof the \"poor material\" enlisting in the army and navy.  This\r\nadmission is a very encouraging sign.  It proves that there is still\r\nenough of the spirit of independence and love of liberty left in the\r\naverage American to risk starvation rather than don the uniform.\r\n\r\nThinking men and women the world over are beginning to realize that\r\npatriotism is too narrow and limited a conception to meet the\r\nnecessities of our time.  The centralization of power has brought\r\ninto being an international feeling of solidarity among the oppressed\r\nnations of the world; a solidarity which represents a greater harmony\r\nof interests between the workingman of America and his brothers\r\nabroad than between the American miner and his exploiting compatriot;\r\na solidarity which fears not foreign invasion, because it is bringing\r\nall the workers to the point when they will say to their masters, \"Go\r\nand do your own killing.  We have done it long enough for you.\"\r\n\r\nThis solidarity is awakening the consciousness of even the soldiers,\r\nthey, too, being flesh of the flesh of the great human family.  A\r\nsolidarity that has proven infallible more than once during past\r\nstruggles, and which has been the impetus inducing the Parisian\r\nsoldiers, during the Commune of 1871, to refuse to obey when ordered\r\nto shoot their brothers.  It has given courage to the men who\r\nmutinied on Russian warships during recent years.  It will eventually\r\nbring about the uprising of all the oppressed and downtrodden against\r\ntheir international exploiters.\r\n\r\nThe proletariat of Europe has realized the great force of that\r\nsolidarity and has, as a result, inaugurated a war against patriotism\r\nand its bloody spectre, militarism.  Thousands of men fill the\r\nprisons of France, Germany, Russia, and the Scandinavian countries,\r\nbecause they dared to defy the ancient superstition.  Nor is the\r\nmovement limited to the working class; it has embraced\r\nrepresentatives in all stations of life, its chief exponents being\r\nmen and women prominent in art, science, and letters.\r\n\r\nAmerica will have to follow suit.  The spirit of militarism has\r\nalready permeated all walks of life.  Indeed, I am convinced that\r\nmilitarism is growing a greater danger here than anywhere else,\r\nbecause of the many bribes capitalism holds out to those whom it\r\nwishes to destroy.\r\n\r\nThe beginning has already been made in the schools.  Evidently the\r\ngovernment holds to the Jesuitical conception, \"Give me the child\r\nmind, and I will mould the man.\"  Children are trained in military\r\ntactics, the glory of military achievements extolled in the\r\ncurriculum, and the youthful minds perverted to suit the government.\r\nFurther, the youth of the country is appealed to in glaring posters\r\nto join the army and navy.  \"A fine chance to see the world!\" cries\r\nthe governmental huckster.  Thus innocent boys are morally shanghaied\r\ninto patriotism, and the military Moloch strides conquering through\r\nthe Nation.\r\n\r\nThe American workingman has suffered so much at the hands of the\r\nsoldier, State, and Federal, that he is quite justified in his\r\ndisgust with, and his opposition to, the uniformed parasite.\r\nHowever, mere denunciation will not solve this great problem.  What\r\nwe need is a propaganda of education for the soldier: anti-patriotic\r\nliterature that will enlighten him as to the real horrors of his\r\ntrade, and that will awaken his consciousness to his true relation to\r\nthe man to whose labor he owes his very existence.\r\n\r\nIt is precisely this that the authorities fear most.  It is already\r\nhigh treason for a soldier to attend a radical meeting.  No doubt\r\nthey will also stamp it high treason for a soldier to read a radical\r\npamphlet.  But then, has not authority from time immemorial stamped\r\nevery step of progress as treasonable?  Those, however, who earnestly\r\nstrive for social reconstruction can well afford to face all that;\r\nfor it is probably even more important to carry the truth into the\r\nbarracks than into the factory.  When we have undermined the\r\npatriotic lie, we shall have cleared the path for that great\r\nstructure wherein all nationalities shall be united into a universal\r\nbrotherhood,--a truly FREE SOCIETY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCISCO FERRER AND THE MODERN SCHOOL\r\n\r\n\r\nExperience has come to be considered the best school of life.  The\r\nman or woman who does not learn some vital lesson in that school is\r\nlooked upon as a dunce indeed.  Yet strange to say, that though\r\norganized institutions continue perpetrating errors, though they\r\nlearn nothing from experience, we acquiesce, as a matter of course.\r\n\r\nThere lived and worked in Barcelona a man by the name of Francisco\r\nFerrer.  A teacher of children he was, known and loved by his people.\r\nOutside of Spain only the cultured few knew of Francisco Ferrer's\r\nwork.  To the world at large this teacher was non-existent.\r\n\r\nOn the first of September, 1909, the Spanish government--at the\r\nbehest of the Catholic Church--arrested Francisco Ferrer.  On the\r\nthirteenth of October, after a mock trial, he was placed in the ditch\r\nat Montjuich prison, against the hideous wall of many sighs, and shot\r\ndead.  Instantly Ferrer, the obscure teacher, became a universal\r\nfigure, blazing forth the indignation and wrath of the whole\r\ncivilized world against the wanton murder.\r\n\r\nThe killing of Francisco Ferrer was not the first crime committed by\r\nthe Spanish government and the Catholic Church.  The history of these\r\ninstitutions is one long stream of fire and blood.  Still they have\r\nnot learned through experience, nor yet come to realize that every\r\nfrail being slain by Church and State grows and grows into a mighty\r\ngiant, who will some day free humanity from their perilous hold.\r\n\r\nFrancisco Ferrer was born in 1859, of humble parents.  They were\r\nCatholics, and therefore hoped to raise their son in the same faith.\r\nThey did not know that the boy was to become the harbinger of a great\r\ntruth, that his mind would refuse to travel in the old path.  At an\r\nearly age Ferrer began to question the faith of his fathers.  He\r\ndemanded to know how it is that the God who spoke to him of goodness\r\nand love would mar the sleep of the innocent child with dread and awe\r\nof tortures, of suffering, of hell.  Alert and of a vivid and\r\ninvestigating mind, it did not take him long to discover the\r\nhideousness of that black monster, the Catholic Church.  He would\r\nhave none of it.\r\n\r\nFrancisco Ferrer was not only a doubter, a searcher for truth; he was\r\nalso a rebel.  His spirit would rise in just indignation against the\r\niron regime of his country, and when a band of rebels, led by the\r\nbrave patriot, General Villacampa, under the banner of the Republican\r\nideal, made an onslaught on that regime, none was more ardent a\r\nfighter than young Francisco Ferrer.  The Republican ideal,--I hope\r\nno one will confound it with the Republicanism of this country.\r\nWhatever objection I, as an Anarchist, have to the Republicans of\r\nLatin countries, I know they tower high above the corrupt and\r\nreactionary party which, in America, is destroying every vestige of\r\nliberty and justice.  One has but to think of the Mazzinis, the\r\nGaribaldis, the scores of others, to realize that their efforts were\r\ndirected, not merely towards the overthrow of despotism, but\r\nparticularly against the Catholic Church, which from its very\r\ninception has been the enemy of all progress and liberalism.\r\n\r\nIn America it is just the reverse.  Republicanism stands for vested\r\nrights, for imperialism, for graft, for the annihilation of every\r\nsemblance of liberty.  Its ideal is the oily, creepy respectability\r\nof a McKinley, and the brutal arrogance of a Roosevelt.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish republican rebels were subdued.  It takes more than one\r\nbrave effort to split the rock of ages, to cut off the head of that\r\nhydra monster, the Catholic Church and the Spanish throne.  Arrest,\r\npersecution, and punishment followed the heroic attempt of the little\r\nband.  Those who could escape the bloodhounds had to flee for safety\r\nto foreign shores.  Francisco Ferrer was among the latter.  He went\r\nto France.\r\n\r\nHow his soul must have expanded in the new land!  France, the cradle\r\nof liberty, of ideas, of action.  Paris, the ever young, intense\r\nParis, with her pulsating life, after the gloom of his own belated\r\ncountry,--how she must have inspired him.  What opportunities, what a\r\nglorious chance for a young idealist.\r\n\r\nFrancisco Ferrer lost no time.  Like one famished he threw himself\r\ninto the various liberal movements, met all kinds of people, learned,\r\nabsorbed, and grew.  While there, he also saw in operation the Modern\r\nSchool, which was to play such an important and fatal part in his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThe Modern School in France was founded long before Ferrer's time.\r\nIts originator, though on a small scale, was that sweet spirit,\r\nLouise Michel.  Whether consciously or unconsciously, our own great\r\nLouise felt long ago that the future belongs to the young generation;\r\nthat unless the young be rescued from that mind and soul destroying\r\ninstitution, the bourgeois school, social evils will continue to\r\nexist.  Perhaps she thought, with Ibsen, that the atmosphere is\r\nsaturated with ghosts, that the adult man and woman have so many\r\nsuperstitions to overcome.  No sooner do they outgrow the deathlike\r\ngrip of one spook, lo! they find themselves in the thralldom of\r\nninety-nine other spooks.  Thus but a few reach the mountain peak of\r\ncomplete regeneration.\r\n\r\nThe child, however, has no traditions to overcome.  Its mind is not\r\nburdened with set ideas, its heart has not grown cold with class and\r\ncaste distinctions.  The child is to the teacher what clay is to the\r\nsculptor.  Whether the world will receive a work of art or a wretched\r\nimitation, depends to a large extent on the creative power of the\r\nteacher.\r\n\r\nLouise Michel was pre-eminently qualified to meet the child's soul\r\ncravings.  Was she not herself of a childlike nature, so sweet and\r\ntender, unsophisticated and generous.  The soul of Louise burned\r\nalways at white heat over every social injustice.  She was invariably\r\nin the front ranks whenever the people of Paris rebelled against some\r\nwrong.  And as she was made to suffer imprisonment for her great\r\ndevotion to the oppressed, the little school on Montmartre was soon\r\nno more.  But the seed was planted, and has since borne fruit in many\r\ncities of France.\r\n\r\nThe most important venture of a Modern School was that of the great,\r\nyoung old man, Paul Robin.  Together with a few friends he\r\nestablished a large school at Cempuis, a beautiful place near Paris.\r\nPaul Robin aimed at a higher ideal than merely modern ideas in\r\neducation.  He wanted to demonstrate by actual facts that the\r\nbourgeois conception of heredity is but a mere pretext to exempt\r\nsociety from its terrible crimes against the young.  The contention\r\nthat the child must suffer for the sins of the fathers, that it must\r\ncontinue in poverty and filth, that it must grow up a drunkard or\r\ncriminal, just because its parents left it no other legacy, was too\r\npreposterous to the beautiful spirit of Paul Robin.  He believed that\r\nwhatever part heredity may play, there are other factors equally\r\ngreat, if not greater, that may and will eradicate or minimize the\r\nso-called first cause.  Proper economic and social environment, the\r\nbreath and freedom of nature, healthy exercise, love and sympathy,\r\nand, above all, a deep understanding for the needs of the\r\nchild--these would destroy the cruel, unjust, and criminal stigma\r\nimposed on the innocent young.\r\n\r\nPaul Robin did not select his children; he did not go to the\r\nso-called best parents: he took his material wherever he could find\r\nit.  From the street, the hovels, the orphan and foundling asylums,\r\nthe reformatories, from all those gray and hideous places where a\r\nbenevolent society hides its victims in order to pacify its guilty\r\nconscience.  He gathered all the dirty, filthy, shivering little\r\nwaifs his place would hold, and brought them to Cempuis.  There,\r\nsurrounded by nature's own glory, free and unrestrained, well fed,\r\nclean kept, deeply loved and understood, the little human plants\r\nbegan to grow, to blossom, to develop beyond even the expectations of\r\ntheir friend and teacher, Paul Robin.\r\n\r\nThe children grew and developed into self-reliant, liberty loving men\r\nand women.  What greater danger to the institutions that make the\r\npoor in order to perpetuate the poor.  Cempuis was closed by the\r\nFrench government on the charge of co-education, which is prohibited\r\nin France.  However, Cempuis had been in operation long enough to\r\nprove to all advanced educators its tremendous possibilities, and to\r\nserve as an impetus for modern methods of education, that are slowly\r\nbut inevitably undermining the present system.\r\n\r\nCempuis was followed by a great number of other educational\r\nattempts,--among them, by Madelaine Vernet, a gifted writer and poet,\r\nauthor of L'AMOUR LIBRE, and Sebastian Faure, with his LA RUCHE,[1]\r\nwhich I visited while in Paris, in 1907.\r\n\r\nSeveral years ago Comrade Faure bought the land on which he built his\r\nLA RUCHE.  In a comparatively short time he succeeded in transforming\r\nthe former wild, uncultivated country into a blooming spot, having\r\nall the appearance of a well kept farm.  A large, square court,\r\nenclosed by three buildings, and a broad path leading to the garden\r\nand orchards, greet the eye of the visitor.  The garden, kept as only\r\na Frenchman knows how, furnishes a large variety of vegetables for LA\r\nRUCHE.\r\n\r\nSebastian Faure is of the opinion that if the child is subjected to\r\ncontradictory influences, its development suffers in consequence.\r\nOnly when the material needs, the hygiene of the home, and\r\nintellectual environment are harmonious, can the child grow into a\r\nhealthy, free being.\r\n\r\nReferring to his school, Sebastian Faure has this to say:\r\n\r\n\"I have taken twenty-four children of both sexes, mostly orphans, or\r\nthose whose parents are too poor to pay.  They are clothed, housed,\r\nand educated at my expense.  Till their twelfth year they will\r\nreceive a sound, elementary education. Between the age of twelve and\r\nfifteen--their studies still continuing--they are to be taught some\r\ntrade, in keeping with their individual disposition and abilities.\r\nAfter that they are at liberty to leave LA RUCHE to begin life in the\r\noutside world, with the assurance that they may at any time return to\r\nLA RUCHE, where they will be received with open arms and welcomed as\r\nparents do their beloved children.  Then, if they wish to work at our\r\nplace, they may do so under the following conditions: One third of\r\nthe product to cover his or her expenses of maintenance, another\r\nthird to go towards the general fund set aside for accommodating new\r\nchildren, and the last third to be devoted to the personal use of the\r\nchild, as he or she may see fit.\r\n\r\n\"The health of the children who are now in my care is perfect.  Pure\r\nair, nutritious food, physical exercise in the open, long walks,\r\nobservation of hygienic rules, the short and interesting method of\r\ninstruction, and, above all, our affectionate understanding and care\r\nof the children, have produced admirable physical and mental results.\r\n\r\n\"It would be unjust to claim that our pupils have accomplished\r\nwonders; yet, considering that they belong to the average, having had\r\nno previous opportunities, the results are very gratifying indeed.\r\nThe most important thing they have acquired--a rare trait with\r\nordinary school children--is the love of study, the desire to know,\r\nto be informed.  They have learned a new method of work, one that\r\nquickens the memory and stimulates the imagination.  We make a\r\nparticular effort to awaken the child's interest in his surroundings,\r\nto make him realize the importance of observation, investigation, and\r\nreflection, so that when the children reach maturity, they would not\r\nbe deaf and blind to the things about them.  Our children never\r\naccept anything in blind faith, without inquiry as to why and\r\nwherefore; nor do they feel satisfied until their questions are\r\nthoroughly answered.  Thus their minds are free from doubts and fear\r\nresultant from incomplete or untruthful replies; it is the latter\r\nwhich warp the growth of the child, and create a lack of confidence\r\nin himself and those about him.\r\n\r\n\"It is surprising how frank and kind and affectionate our little ones\r\nare to each other.  The harmony between themselves and the adults at\r\nLA RUCHE is highly encouraging.  We should feel at fault if the\r\nchildren were to fear or honor us merely because we are their elders.\r\nWe leave nothing undone to gain their confidence and love; that\r\naccomplished, understanding will replace duty; confidence, fear; and\r\naffection, severity.\r\n\r\n\"No one has yet fully realized the wealth of sympathy, kindness, and\r\ngenerosity hidden in the soul of the child.  The effort of every true\r\neducator should be to unlock that treasure--to stimulate the child's\r\nimpulses, and call forth the best and noblest tendencies.  What\r\ngreater reward can there be for one whose life-work is to watch over\r\nthe growth of the human plant, than to see its nature unfold its\r\npetals, and to observe it develop into a true individuality.  My\r\ncomrades at LA RUCHE look for no greater reward, and it is due to\r\nthem and their efforts, even more than to my own, that our human\r\ngarden promises to bear beautiful fruit.\"[2]\r\n\r\nRegarding the subject of history and the prevailing old methods of\r\ninstruction, Sebastian Faure said:\r\n\r\n\"We explain to our children that true history is yet to be\r\nwritten,--the story of those who have died, unknown, in the effort to\r\naid humanity to greater achievement.\"[3]\r\n\r\nFrancisco Ferrer could not escape this great wave of Modern School\r\nattempts.  He saw its possibilities, not merely in theoretic form,\r\nbut in their practical application to every-day needs.  He must have\r\nrealized that Spain, more than any other country, stands in need of\r\njust such schools, if it is ever to throw off the double yoke of\r\npriest and soldier.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider that the entire system of education in Spain is in\r\nthe hands of the Catholic Church, and when we further remember the\r\nCatholic formula, \"To inculcate Catholicism in the mind of the child\r\nuntil it is nine years of age is to ruin it forever for any other\r\nidea,\" we will understand the tremendous task of Ferrer in bringing\r\nthe new light to his people.  Fate soon assisted him in realizing his\r\ngreat dream.\r\n\r\nMlle. Meunier, a pupil of Francisco Ferrer, and a lady of wealth,\r\nbecame interested in the Modern School project.  When she died, she\r\nleft Ferrer some valuable property and twelve thousand francs yearly\r\nincome for the School.\r\n\r\nIt is said that mean souls can conceive of naught but mean ideas.\r\nIf so, the contemptible methods of the Catholic Church to blackguard\r\nFerrer's character, in order to justify her own black crime, can\r\nreadily be explained.  Thus the lie was spread in American Catholic\r\npapers, that Ferrer used his intimacy with Mlle. Meunier to get\r\npossession of her money.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I hold that the intimacy, of whatever nature, between a\r\nman and a woman, is their own affair, their sacred own.  I would\r\ntherefore not lose a word in referring to the matter, if it were not\r\none of the many dastardly lies circulated about Ferrer.  Of course,\r\nthose who know the purity of the Catholic clergy will understand the\r\ninsinuation.  Have the Catholic priests ever looked upon woman as\r\nanything but a sex commodity?  The historical data regarding the\r\ndiscoveries in the cloisters and monasteries will bear me out in\r\nthat.  How, then, are they to understand the co-operation of a man\r\nand a woman, except on a sex basis?\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, Mlle. Meunier was considerably Ferrer's senior.\r\nHaving spent her childhood and girlhood with a miserly father and a\r\nsubmissive mother, she could easily appreciate the necessity of love\r\nand joy in child life.  She must have seen that Francisco Ferrer was\r\na teacher, not college, machine, or diploma-made, but one endowed\r\nwith genius for that calling.\r\n\r\nEquipped with knowledge, with experience, and with the necessary\r\nmeans; above all, imbued with the divine fire of his mission, our\r\nComrade came back to Spain, and there began his life's work.  On the\r\nninth of September, 1901, the first Modern School was opened.  It was\r\nenthusiastically received by the people of Barcelona, who pledged\r\ntheir support.  In a short address at the opening of the School,\r\nFerrer submitted his program to his friends.  He said: \"I am not a\r\nspeaker, not a propagandist, not a fighter.  I am a teacher; I love\r\nchildren above everything.  I think I understand them.  I want my\r\ncontribution to the cause of liberty to be a young generation ready\r\nto meet a new era.\"\r\n\r\nHe was cautioned by his friends to be careful in his opposition to\r\nthe Catholic Church.  They knew to what lengths she would go to\r\ndispose of an enemy.  Ferrer, too, knew.  But, like Brand, he\r\nbelieved in all or nothing.  He would not erect the Modern School on\r\nthe same old lie.  He would be frank and honest and open with the\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nFrancisco Ferrer became a marked man.  From the very first day of the\r\nopening of the School, he was shadowed.  The school building was\r\nwatched, his little home in Mangat was watched.  He was followed\r\nevery step, even when he went to France or England to confer with his\r\ncolleagues.  He was a marked man, and it was only a question of time\r\nwhen the lurking enemy would tighten the noose.\r\n\r\nIt succeeded, almost, in 1906, when Ferrer was implicated in the\r\nattempt on the life of Alfonso.  The evidence exonerating him was too\r\nstrong even for the black crows;[4] they had to let him go--not for\r\ngood, however.  They waited.  Oh, they can wait, when they have set\r\nthemselves to trap a victim.\r\n\r\nThe moment came at last, during the anti-military uprising in Spain,\r\nin July, 1909.  One will have to search in vain the annals of\r\nrevolutionary history to find a more remarkable protest against\r\nmilitarism.  Having been soldier-ridden for centuries, the people of\r\nSpain could stand the yoke no longer.  They would refuse to\r\nparticipate in useless slaughter.  They saw no reason for aiding a\r\ndespotic government in subduing and oppressing a small people\r\nfighting for their independence, as did the brave Riffs.  No, they\r\nwould not bear arms against them.\r\n\r\nFor eighteen hundred years the Catholic Church has preached the\r\ngospel of peace.  Yet, when the people actually wanted to make this\r\ngospel a living reality, she urged the authorities to force them to\r\nbear arms.  Thus the dynasty of Spain followed the murderous methods\r\nof the Russian dynasty,--the people were forced to the battlefield.\r\n\r\nThen, and not until then, was their power of endurance at an end.\r\nThen, and not until then, did the workers of Spain turn against their\r\nmasters, against those who, like leeches, had drained their strength,\r\ntheir very life-blood.  Yes, they attacked the churches and the\r\npriests, but if the latter had a thousand lives, they could not\r\npossibly pay for the terrible outrages and crimes perpetrated upon\r\nthe Spanish people.\r\n\r\nFrancisco Ferrer was arrested on the first of September, 1909.\r\nUntil October first, his friends and comrades did not even know what\r\nhad become of him.  On that day a letter was received by L'HUMANITE,\r\nfrom which can be learned the whole mockery of the trial.  And the\r\nnext day his companion, Soledad Villafranca, received the following\r\nletter:\r\n\r\n\"No reason to worry; you know I am absolutely innocent.  Today I am\r\nparticularly hopeful and joyous.  It is the first time I can write to\r\nyou, and the first time since my arrest that I can bathe in the rays\r\nof the sun, streaming generously through my cell window.  You, too,\r\nmust be joyous.\"\r\n\r\nHow pathetic that Ferrer should have believed, as late as October\r\nfourth, that he would not be condemned to death.  Even more pathetic\r\nthat his friends and comrades should once more have made the blunder\r\nin crediting the enemy with a sense of justice.  Time and again they\r\nhad placed faith in the judicial powers, only to see their brothers\r\nkilled before their very eyes.  They made no preparation to rescue\r\nFerrer, not even a protest of any extent; nothing.  \"Why, it is\r\nimpossible to condemn Ferrer; he is innocent.\"  But everything is\r\npossible with the Catholic Church.  Is she not a practiced henchman,\r\nwhose trials of her enemies are the worst mockery of justice?\r\n\r\nOn October fourth Ferrer sent the following letter to L'HUMANITE:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                     The Prison Cell, Oct. 4, 1909.\r\n\r\n     My dear Friends--Notwithstanding most absolute innocence, the\r\n     prosecutor demands the death penalty, based on denunciations of\r\n     the police, representing me as the chief of the world's\r\n     Anarchists, directing the labor syndicates of France, and guilty\r\n     of conspiracies and insurrections everywhere, and declaring that\r\n     my voyages to London and Paris were undertaken with no other\r\n     object.\r\n\r\n     With such infamous lies they are trying to kill me.\r\n\r\n     The messenger is about to depart and I have not time for more.\r\n     All the evidence presented to the investigating judge by the\r\n     police is nothing but a tissue of lies and calumnious\r\n     insinuations.  But no proofs against me, having done nothing at\r\n     all.\r\n\r\n                                                     FERRER.\r\n\r\n\r\nOctober thirteenth, 1909, Ferrer's heart, so brave, so staunch, so\r\nloyal, was stilled.  Poor fools!  The last agonized throb of that\r\nheart had barely died away when it began to beat a hundredfold in the\r\nhearts of the civilized world, until it grew into terrific thunder,\r\nhurling forth its malediction upon the instigators of the black\r\ncrime.  Murderers of black garb and pious mien, to the bar of\r\njustice!\r\n\r\nDid Francisco Ferrer participate in the anti-military uprising?\r\nAccording to the first indictment, which appeared in a Catholic paper\r\nin Madrid, signed by the Bishop and all the prelates of Barcelona, he\r\nwas not even accused of participation.  The indictment was to the\r\neffect that Francisco Ferrer was guilty of having organized godless\r\nschools, and having circulated godless literature.  But in the\r\ntwentieth century men can not be burned merely for their godless\r\nbeliefs.  Something else had to be devised; hence the charge of\r\ninstigating the uprising.\r\n\r\nIn no authentic source so far investigated could a single proof be\r\nfound to connect Ferrer with the uprising.  But then, no proofs were\r\nwanted, or accepted, by the authorities.  There were seventy-two\r\nwitnesses, to be sure, but their testimony was taken on paper.  They\r\nnever were confronted with Ferrer, or he with them.\r\n\r\nIs it psychologically possible that Ferrer should have participated?\r\nI do not believe it is, and here are my reasons.  Francisco Ferrer\r\nwas not only a great teacher, but he was also undoubtedly a marvelous\r\norganizer.  In eight years, between 1901-1909, he had organized in\r\nSpain one hundred and nine schools, besides inducing the liberal\r\nelement of his country to organize three hundred and eight other\r\nschools.  In connection with his own school work, Ferrer had equipped\r\na modern printing plant, organized a staff of translators, and spread\r\nbroadcast one hundred and fifty thousand copies of modern scientific\r\nand sociologic works, not to forget the large quantity of rationalist\r\ntext books.  Surely none but the most methodical and efficient\r\norganizer could have accomplished such a feat.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it was absolutely proven that the anti-military\r\nuprising was not at all organized; that it came as a surprise to the\r\npeople themselves, like a great many revolutionary waves on previous\r\noccasions.  The people of Barcelona, for instance, had the city in\r\ntheir control for four days, and, according to the statement of\r\ntourists, greater order and peace never prevailed.  Of course, the\r\npeople were so little prepared that when the time came, they did not\r\nknow what to do.  In this regard they were like the people of Paris\r\nduring the Commune of 1871.  They, too, were unprepared.  While they\r\nwere starving, they protected the warehouses, filled to the brim with\r\nprovisions.  They placed sentinels to guard the Bank of France, where\r\nthe bourgeoisie kept the stolen money.  The workers of Barcelona,\r\ntoo, watched over the spoils of their masters.\r\n\r\nHow pathetic is the stupidity of the underdog; how terribly tragic!\r\nBut, then, have not his fetters been forged so deeply into his flesh,\r\nthat he would not, even if he could, break them?  The awe of\r\nauthority, of law, of private property, hundredfold burned into his\r\nsoul,--how is he to throw it off unprepared, unexpectedly?\r\n\r\nCan anyone assume for a moment that a man like Ferrer would affiliate\r\nhimself with such a spontaneous, unorganized effort?  Would he not\r\nhave known that it would result in a defeat, a disastrous defeat for\r\nthe people?  And is it not more likely that if he would have taken\r\npart, he, the experienced ENTREPRENEUR, would have thoroughly\r\norganized the attempt?  If all other proofs were lacking, that one\r\nfactor would be sufficient to exonerate Francisco Ferrer.  But there\r\nare others equally convincing.\r\n\r\nFor the very date of the outbreak, July twenty-fifth, Ferrer had\r\ncalled a conference of his teachers and members of the League of\r\nRational Education.  It was to consider the autumn work, and\r\nparticularly the publication of Elisee Reclus' great book, L'HOMME ET\r\nLA TERRE, and Peter Kropotkin's GREAT FRENCH REVOLUTION.  Is it at\r\nall likely, is it at all plausible that Ferrer, knowing of the\r\nuprising, being a party to it, would in cold blood invite his friends\r\nand colleagues to Barcelona for the day on which he realized their\r\nlives would be endangered?  Surely, only the criminal, vicious mind\r\nof a Jesuit could credit such deliberate murder.\r\n\r\nFrancisco Ferrer had his life-work mapped out; he had everything to\r\nlose and nothing to gain, except ruin and disaster, were he to lend\r\nassistance to the outbreak.  Not that he doubted the justice of the\r\npeople's wrath; but his work, his hope, his very nature was directed\r\ntoward another goal.\r\n\r\nIn vain are the frantic efforts of the Catholic Church, her lies,\r\nfalsehoods, calumnies.  She stands condemned by the awakened human\r\nconscience of having once more repeated the foul crimes of the past.\r\n\r\nFrancisco Ferrer is accused of teaching the children the most\r\nblood-curdling ideas,--to hate God, for instance.  Horrors!\r\nFrancisco Ferrer did not believe in the existence of a God.  Why\r\nteach the child to hate something which does not exist?  Is it not\r\nmore likely that he took the children out into the open, that he\r\nshowed them the splendor of the sunset, the brilliancy of the starry\r\nheavens, the awe-inspiring wonder of the mountains and seas; that he\r\nexplained to them in his simple, direct way the law of growth, of\r\ndevelopment, of the interrelation of all life?  In so doing he made\r\nit forever impossible for the poisonous weeds of the Catholic Church\r\nto take root in the child's mind.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated that Ferrer prepared the children to destroy the\r\nrich.  Ghost stories of old maids.  Is it not more likely that he\r\nprepared them to succor the poor?  That he taught them the\r\nhumiliation, the degradation, the awfulness of poverty, which is a\r\nvice and not a virtue; that he taught the dignity and importance of\r\nall creative efforts, which alone sustain life and build character.\r\nIs it not the best and most effective way of bringing into the proper\r\nlight the absolute uselessness and injury of parasitism?\r\n\r\nLast, but not least, Ferrer is charged with undermining the army by\r\ninculcating anti-military ideas.  Indeed?  He must have believed with\r\nTolstoy that war is legalized slaughter, that it perpetuates hatred\r\nand arrogance, that it eats away the heart of nations, and turns them\r\ninto raving maniacs.\r\n\r\nHowever, we have Ferrer's own word regarding his ideas of modern\r\neducation:\r\n\r\n\"I would like to call the attention of my readers to this idea: All\r\nthe value of education rests in the respect for the physical,\r\nintellectual, and moral will of the child.  Just as in science no\r\ndemonstration is possible save by facts, just so there is no real\r\neducation save that which is exempt from all dogmatism, which leaves\r\nto the child itself the direction of its effort, and confines itself\r\nto the seconding of its effort.  Now, there is nothing easier than to\r\nalter this purpose, and nothing harder than to respect it.\r\nEducation is always imposing, violating, constraining; the real\r\neducator is he who can best protect the child against his (the\r\nteacher's) own ideas, his peculiar whims; he who can best appeal to\r\nthe child's own energies.\r\n\r\n\"We are convinced that the education of the future will be of an\r\nentirely spontaneous nature; certainly we can not as yet realize it,\r\nbut the evolution of methods in the direction of a wider\r\ncomprehension of the phenomena of life, and the fact that all\r\nadvances toward perfection mean the overcoming of restraint,--all\r\nthis indicates that we are in the right when we hope for the\r\ndeliverance of the child through science.\r\n\r\n\"Let us not fear to say that we want men capable of evolving without\r\nstopping, capable of destroying and renewing their environments\r\nwithout cessation, of renewing themselves also;  men, whose\r\nintellectual independence will be their greatest force, who will\r\nattach themselves to nothing, always ready to accept what is best,\r\nhappy in the triumph of new ideas, aspiring to live multiple lives in\r\none life.  Society fears such men; we therefore must not hope that it\r\nwill ever want an education able to give them to us.\r\n\r\n\"We shall follow the labors of the scientists who study the child\r\nwith the greatest attention, and we shall eagerly seek for means of\r\napplying their experience to the education which we want to build up,\r\nin the direction of an ever fuller liberation of the individual.\r\nBut how can we attain our end?  Shall it not be by putting ourselves\r\ndirectly to the work favoring the foundation of new schools, which\r\nshall be ruled as much as possible by this spirit of liberty, which\r\nwe forefeel will dominate the entire work of education in the future?\r\n\r\n\"A trial has been made, which, for the present, has already given\r\nexcellent results.  We can destroy all which in the present school\r\nanswers to the organization of constraint, the artificial\r\nsurroundings by which children are separated from nature and life,\r\nthe intellectual and moral discipline made use of to impose\r\nready-made ideas upon them, beliefs which deprave and annihilate\r\nnatural bent.  Without fear of deceiving ourselves, we can restore\r\nthe child to the environment which entices it, the environment of\r\nnature in which he will be in contact with all that he loves, and in\r\nwhich impressions of life will replace fastidious book-learning.  If\r\nwe did no more than that, we should already have prepared in great\r\npart the deliverance of the child.\r\n\r\n\"In such conditions we might already freely apply the data of science\r\nand labor most fruitfully.\r\n\r\n\"I know very well we could not thus realize all our hopes, that we\r\nshould often be forced, for lack of knowledge, to employ undesirable\r\nmethods; but a certitude would sustain us in our efforts--namely,\r\nthat even without reaching our aim completely we should do more and\r\nbetter in our still imperfect work than the present school\r\naccomplishes.  I like the free spontaneity of a child who knows\r\nnothing, better than the world-knowledge and intellectual deformity\r\nof a child who has been subjected to our present education.\"[5]\r\n\r\nHad Ferrer actually organized the riots, had he fought on the\r\nbarricades, had he hurled a hundred bombs, he could not have been so\r\ndangerous to the Catholic Church and to despotism, as with his\r\nopposition to discipline and restraint.  Discipline and\r\nrestraint--are they not back of all the evils in the world?\r\nSlavery, submission, poverty, all misery, all social iniquities\r\nresult from discipline and restraint.  Indeed, Ferrer was dangerous.\r\nTherefore he had to die, October thirteenth, 1909, in the ditch of\r\nMontjuich.  Yet who dare say his death was in vain?  In view of the\r\ntempestuous rise of universal indignation: Italy naming streets in\r\nmemory of Francisco Ferrer, Belgium inaugurating a movement to erect\r\na memorial; France calling to the front her most illustrious men to\r\nresume the heritage of the martyr; England being the first to issue a\r\nbiography:--all countries uniting in perpetuating the great work of\r\nFrancisco Ferrer; America, even, tardy always in progressive ideas,\r\ngiving birth to a Francisco Ferrer Association, its aim being to\r\npublish a complete life of Ferrer and to organize Modern Schools all\r\nover the country; in the face of this international revolutionary\r\nwave, who is there to say Ferrer died in vain?\r\n\r\nThat death at Montjuich,--how wonderful, how dramatic it was, how it\r\nstirs the human soul.  Proud and erect, the inner eye turned toward\r\nthe light, Francisco Ferrer needed no lying priests to give him\r\ncourage, nor did he upbraid a phantom for forsaking him.  The\r\nconsciousness that his executioners represented a dying age, and that\r\nhis was the living truth, sustained him in the last heroic moments.\r\n\r\n          A dying age and a living truth,\r\n          The living burying the dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] THE BEEHIVE.\r\n\r\n[2] MOTHER EARTH, 1907.\r\n\r\n[3] Ibid.\r\n\r\n[4] Black crows: The Catholic clergy.\r\n\r\n[5] MOTHER EARTH, December, 1909.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HYPOCRISY OF PURITANISM\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Puritanism in relation to American art, Mr. Gutzen\r\nBurglum said: \"Puritanism has made us self-centered and hypocritical\r\nfor so long, that sincerity and reverence for what is natural in our\r\nimpulses have been fairly bred out of us, with the result that there\r\ncan be neither truth nor individuality in our art.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Burglum might have added that Puritanism has made life itself\r\nimpossible.  More than art, more than estheticism, life represents\r\nbeauty in a thousand variations; it is, indeed, a gigantic panorama\r\nof eternal change.  Puritanism, on the other hand, rests on a fixed\r\nand immovable conception of life; it is based on the Calvinistic idea\r\nthat life is a curse, imposed upon man by the wrath of God.  In order\r\nto redeem himself man must do constant penance, must repudiate every\r\nnatural and healthy impulse, and turn his back on joy and beauty.\r\n\r\nPuritanism celebrated its reign of terror in England during the\r\nsixteenth and seventeenth centuries, destroying and crushing every\r\nmanifestation of art and culture.  It was the spirit of Puritanism\r\nwhich robbed Shelley of his children, because he would not bow to the\r\ndicta of religion.  It was the same narrow spirit which alienated\r\nByron from his native land, because that great genius rebelled\r\nagainst the monotony, dullness, and pettiness of his country.  It was\r\nPuritanism, too, that forced some of England's freest women into the\r\nconventional lie of marriage: Mary Wollstonecraft and, later, George\r\nEliot.  And recently Puritanism has demanded another toll--the life\r\nof Oscar Wilde.  In fact, Puritanism has never ceased to be the most\r\npernicious factor in the domain of John Bull, acting as censor of the\r\nartistic expression of his people, and stamping its approval only on\r\nthe dullness of middle-class respectability.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore sheer British jingoism which points to America as the\r\ncountry of Puritanic provincialism.  It is quite true that our life\r\nis stunted by Puritanism, and that the latter is killing what is\r\nnatural and healthy in our impulses.  But it is equally true that it\r\nis to England that we are indebted for transplanting this spirit on\r\nAmerican soil.  It was bequeathed to us by the Pilgrim fathers.\r\nFleeing from persecution and oppression, the Pilgrims of Mayflower\r\nfame established in the New World a reign of Puritanic tyranny and\r\ncrime.  The history of New England, and especially of Massachusetts,\r\nis full of the horrors that have turned life into gloom, joy into\r\ndespair, naturalness into disease, honesty and truth into hideous\r\nlies and hypocrisies.  The ducking-stool and whipping post, as well\r\nas numerous other devices of torture, were the favorite English\r\nmethods for American purification.\r\n\r\nBoston, the city of culture, has gone down in the annals of\r\nPuritanism as the \"Bloody Town.\"  It rivaled Salem, even, in her\r\ncruel persecution of unauthorized religious opinions.  On the now\r\nfamous Common a half-naked woman, with a baby in her arms, was\r\npublicly whipped for the crime of free speech; and on the same spot\r\nMary Dyer, another Quaker woman, was hanged in 1659.  In fact, Boston\r\nhas been the scene of more than one wanton crime committed by\r\nPuritanism.  Salem, in the summer of 1692, killed eighteen people for\r\nwitchcraft.  Nor was Massachusetts alone in driving out the devil by\r\nfire and brimstone.  As Canning justly said: \"The Pilgrim fathers\r\ninfested the New World to redress the balance of the Old.\"  The\r\nhorrors of that period have found their most supreme expression in\r\nthe American classic, THE SCARLET LETTER.\r\n\r\nPuritanism no longer employs the thumbscrew and lash; but it still\r\nhas a most pernicious hold on the minds and feelings of the American\r\npeople.  Naught else can explain the power of a Comstock.  Like the\r\nTorquemadas of ante-bellum days, Anthony Comstock is the autocrat of\r\nAmerican morals; he dictates the standards of good and evil, of\r\npurity and vice.  Like a thief in the night he sneaks into the\r\nprivate lives of the people, into their most intimate relations.\r\nThe system of espionage established by this man Comstock puts to\r\nshame the infamous Third Division of the Russian secret police.  Why\r\ndoes the public tolerate such an outrage on its liberties?  Simply\r\nbecause Comstock is but the loud expression of the Puritanism bred in\r\nthe Anglo-Saxon blood, and from whose thraldom even liberals have not\r\nsucceeded in fully emancipating themselves.  The visionless and\r\nleaden elements of the old Young Men's and Women's Christian\r\nTemperance Unions, Purity Leagues, American Sabbath Unions, and the\r\nProhibition Party, with Anthony Comstock as their patron saint, are\r\nthe grave diggers of American art and culture.\r\n\r\nEurope can at least boast of a bold art and literature which delve\r\ndeeply into the social and sexual problems of our time, exercising a\r\nsevere critique of all our shams.  As with a surgeon's knife every\r\nPuritanic carcass is dissected, and the way thus cleared for man's\r\nliberation from the dead weights of the past.  But with Puritanism as\r\nthe constant check upon American life, neither truth nor sincerity is\r\npossible.  Nothing but gloom and mediocrity to dictate human conduct,\r\ncurtail natural expression, and stifle our best impulses.\r\nPuritanism in this the twentieth century is as much the enemy of\r\nfreedom and beauty as it was when it landed on Plymouth Rock.  It\r\nrepudiates, as something vile and sinful, our deepest feelings; but\r\nbeing absolutely ignorant as to the real functions of human emotions,\r\nPuritanism is itself the creator of the most unspeakable vices.\r\n\r\nThe entire history of asceticism proves this to be only too true.\r\nThe Church, as well as Puritanism, has fought the flesh as something\r\nevil; it had to be subdued and hidden at all cost.  The result of\r\nthis vicious attitude is only now beginning to be recognized by\r\nmodern thinkers and educators.  They realize that \"nakedness has a\r\nhygienic value as well as a spiritual significance, far beyond its\r\ninfluences in allaying the natural inquisitiveness of the young or\r\nacting as a preventative of morbid emotion.  It is an inspiration to\r\nadults who have long outgrown any youthful curiosities.  The vision\r\nof the essential and eternal human form, the nearest thing to us in\r\nall the world, with its vigor and its beauty and its grace, is one of\r\nthe prime tonics of life.\"[1] But the spirit of purism has so perverted\r\nthe human mind that it has lost the power to appreciate the beauty of\r\nnudity, forcing us to hide the natural form under the plea of\r\nchastity.  Yet chastity itself is but an artificial imposition upon\r\nnature, expressive of a false shame of the human form.  The modern\r\nidea of chastity, especially in reference to woman, its greatest\r\nvictim, is but the sensuous exaggeration of our natural impulses.\r\n\"Chastity varies with the amount of clothing,\" and hence Christians\r\nand purists forever hasten to cover the \"heathen\" with tatters, and\r\nthus convert him to goodness and chastity.\r\n\r\nPuritanism, with its perversion of the significance and functions of\r\nthe human body, especially in regard to woman, has condemned her to\r\ncelibacy, or to the indiscriminate breeding of a diseased race, or to\r\nprostitution.  The enormity of this crime against humanity is\r\napparent when we consider the results.  Absolute sexual continence is\r\nimposed upon the unmarried woman, under pain of being considered\r\nimmoral or fallen, with the result of producing neurasthenia,\r\nimpotence, depression, and a great variety of nervous complaints\r\ninvolving diminished power of work, limited enjoyment of life,\r\nsleeplessness, and preoccupation with sexual desires and imaginings.\r\nThe arbitrary and pernicious dictum of total continence probably also\r\nexplains the mental inequality of the sexes.  Thus Freud believes\r\nthat the intellectual inferiority of so many women is due to the\r\ninhibition of thought imposed upon them for the purpose of sexual\r\nrepression.  Having thus suppressed the natural sex desires of the\r\nunmarried woman, Puritanism, on the other hand, blesses her married\r\nsister for incontinent fruitfulness in wedlock.  Indeed, not merely\r\nblesses her, but forces the woman, oversexed by previous repression,\r\nto bear children, irrespective of weakened physical condition or\r\neconomic inability to rear a large family.  Prevention, even by\r\nscientifically determined safe methods, is absolutely prohibited;\r\nnay, the very mention of the subject is considered criminal.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks to this Puritanic tyranny, the majority of women soon find\r\nthemselves at the ebb of their physical resources.  Ill and worn,\r\nthey are utterly unable to give their children even elementary care.\r\nThat, added to economic pressure, forces many women to risk utmost\r\ndanger rather than continue to bring forth life.  The custom of\r\nprocuring abortions has reached such vast proportions in America as\r\nto be almost beyond belief.  According to recent investigations along\r\nthis line, seventeen abortions are committed in every hundred\r\npregnancies.  This fearful percentage represents only cases which\r\ncome to the knowledge of physicians.  Considering the secrecy in\r\nwhich this practice is necessarily shrouded, and the consequent\r\nprofessional inefficiency and neglect, Puritanism continuously exacts\r\nthousands of victims to its own stupidity and hypocrisy.\r\n\r\nProstitution, although hounded, imprisoned, and chained, is\r\nnevertheless the greatest triumph of Puritanism.  It is its most\r\ncherished child, all hypocritical sanctimoniousness notwithstanding.\r\nThe prostitute is the fury of our century, sweeping across the\r\n\"civilized\" countries like a hurricane, and leaving a trail of\r\ndisease and disaster.  The only remedy Puritanism offers for this\r\nill-begotten child is greater repression and more merciless\r\npersecution.  The latest outrage is represented by the Page Law,\r\nwhich imposes upon New York the terrible failure and crime of Europe;\r\nnamely, registration and segregation of the unfortunate victims of\r\nPuritanism.  In equally stupid manner purism seeks to check the\r\nterrible scourge of its own creation--venereal diseases.  Most\r\ndisheartening it is that this spirit of obtuse narrow-mindedness has\r\npoisoned even our so-called liberals, and has blinded them into\r\njoining the crusade against the very things born of the hypocrisy of\r\nPuritanism--prostitution and its results.  In wilful blindness\r\nPuritanism refuses to see that the true method of prevention is the\r\none which makes it clear to all that \"venereal diseases are not a\r\nmysterious or terrible thing, the penalty of the sin of the flesh, a\r\nsort of shameful evil branded by purist malediction, but an ordinary\r\ndisease which may be treated and cured.\"  By its methods of\r\nobscurity, disguise, and concealment, Puritanism has furnished\r\nfavorable conditions for the growth and spread of these diseases.\r\nIts bigotry is again most strikingly demonstrated by the senseless\r\nattitude in regard to the great discovery of Prof. Ehrlich, hypocrisy\r\nveiling the important cure for syphilis with vague allusions to a\r\nremedy for \"a certain poison.\"\r\n\r\nThe almost limitless capacity of Puritanism for evil is due to its\r\nintrenchment behind the State and the law.  Pretending to safeguard\r\nthe people against \"immorality,\" it has impregnated the machinery of\r\ngovernment and added to its usurpation of moral guardianship the\r\nlegal censorship of our views, feelings, and even of our conduct.\r\n\r\nArt, literature, the drama, the privacy of the mails, in fact, our\r\nmost intimate tastes, are at the mercy of this inexorable tyrant.\r\nAnthony Comstock, or some other equally ignorant policeman, has been\r\ngiven power to desecrate genius, to soil and mutilate the sublimest\r\ncreation of nature--the human form.  Books dealing with the most\r\nvital issues of our lives, and seeking to shed light upon dangerously\r\nobscured problems, are legally treated as criminal offenses, and their\r\nhelpless authors thrown into prison or driven to destruction and\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nNot even in the domain of the Tsar is personal liberty daily outraged\r\nto the extent it is in America, the stronghold of the Puritanic\r\neunuchs.  Here the only day of recreation left to the masses, Sunday,\r\nhas been made hideous and utterly impossible.  All writers on\r\nprimitive customs and ancient civilization agree that the Sabbath was\r\na day of festivities, free from care and duties, a day of general\r\nrejoicing and merry-making.  In every European country this tradition\r\ncontinues to bring some relief from the humdrum and stupidity of our\r\nChristian era.  Everywhere concert halls, theaters, museums, and\r\ngardens are filled with men, women, and children, particularly\r\nworkers with their families, full of life and joy, forgetful of the\r\nordinary rules and conventions of their every-day existence.  It is\r\non that day that the masses demonstrate what life might really mean\r\nin a sane society, with work stripped of its profit-making,\r\nsoul-destroying purpose.\r\n\r\nPuritanism has robbed the people even of that one day.  Naturally,\r\nonly the workers are affected: our millionaires have their luxurious\r\nhomes and elaborate clubs.  The poor, however, are condemned to the\r\nmonotony and dullness of the American Sunday.  The sociability and\r\nfun of European outdoor life is here exchanged for the gloom of the\r\nchurch, the stuffy, germ-saturated country parlor, or the brutalizing\r\natmosphere of the back-room saloon.  In Prohibition States the people\r\nlack even the latter, unless they can invest their meager earnings in\r\nquantities of adulterated liquor.  As to Prohibition, every one knows\r\nwhat a farce it really is.  Like all other achievements of Puritanism\r\nit, too, has but driven the \"devil\" deeper into the human system.\r\nNowhere else does one meet so many drunkards as in our Prohibition\r\ntowns.  But so long as one can use scented candy to abate the foul\r\nbreath of hypocrisy, Puritanism is triumphant.  Ostensibly\r\nProhibition is opposed to liquor for reasons of health and economy,\r\nbut the very spirit of Prohibition being itself abnormal, it succeeds\r\nbut in creating an abnormal life.\r\n\r\nEvery stimulus which quickens the imagination and raises the spirits,\r\nis as necessary to our life as air.  It invigorates the body, and\r\ndeepens our vision of human fellowship.  Without stimuli, in one form\r\nor another, creative work is impossible, nor indeed the spirit of\r\nkindliness and generosity.  The fact that some great geniuses have\r\nseen their reflection in the goblet too frequently, does not justify\r\nPuritanism in attempting to fetter the whole gamut of human emotions.\r\nA Byron and a Poe have stirred humanity deeper than all the Puritans\r\ncan ever hope to do.  The former have given to life meaning and\r\ncolor; the latter are turning red blood into water, beauty into\r\nugliness, variety into uniformity and decay.  Puritanism, in whatever\r\nexpression, is a poisonous germ.  On the surface everything may look\r\nstrong and vigorous; yet the poison works its way persistently, until\r\nthe entire fabric is doomed.  With Hippolyte Taine, every truly free\r\nspirit has come to realize that \"Puritanism is the death of culture,\r\nphilosophy, humor, and good fellowship; its characteristics are\r\ndullness, monotony, and gloom.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SEX.  Havelock Ellis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRAFFIC IN WOMEN\r\n\r\n\r\nOur reformers have suddenly made a great discovery--the white slave\r\ntraffic.  The papers are full of these \"unheard of conditions,\" and\r\nlawmakers are already planning a new set of laws to check the horror.\r\n\r\nIt is significant that whenever the public mind is to be diverted\r\nfrom a great social wrong, a crusade is inaugurated against\r\nindecency, gambling, saloons, etc.  And what is the result of such\r\ncrusades?  Gambling is increasing, saloons are doing a lively\r\nbusiness through back entrances, prostitution is at its height, and\r\nthe system of pimps and cadets is but aggravated.\r\n\r\nHow is it that an institution, known almost to every child, should\r\nhave been discovered so suddenly?  How is it that this evil, known to\r\nall sociologists, should now be made such an important issue?\r\n\r\nTo assume that the recent investigation of the white slave traffic\r\n(and, by the way, a very superficial investigation) has discovered\r\nanything new, is, to say the least, very foolish.  Prostitution has\r\nbeen, and is, a widespread evil, yet mankind goes on its business,\r\nperfectly indifferent to the sufferings and distress of the victims\r\nof prostitution.  As indifferent, indeed, as mankind has remained to\r\nour industrial system, or to economic prostitution.\r\n\r\nOnly when human sorrows are turned into a toy with glaring colors\r\nwill baby people become interested--for a while at least.  The people\r\nare a very fickle baby that must have new toys every day.  The\r\n\"righteous\" cry against the white slave traffic is such a toy.  It\r\nserves to amuse the people for a little while, and it will help to\r\ncreate a few more fat political jobs--parasites who stalk about the\r\nworld as inspectors, investigators, detectives, and so forth.\r\n\r\nWhat is really the cause of the trade in women?  Not merely white\r\nwomen, but yellow and black women as well.  Exploitation, of course;\r\nthe merciless Moloch of capitalism that fattens on underpaid labor,\r\nthus driving thousands of women and girls into prostitution.  With\r\nMrs. Warren these girls feel, \"Why waste your life working for a few\r\nshillings a week in a scullery, eighteen hours a day?\"\r\n\r\nNaturally our reformers say nothing about this cause.  They know it\r\nwell enough, but it doesn't pay to say anything about it.  It is much\r\nmore profitable to play the Pharisee, to pretend an outraged\r\nmorality, than to go to the bottom of things.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is one commendable exception among the young writers:\r\nReginald Wright Kauffman, whose work, THE HOUSE OF BONDAGE, is the\r\nfirst earnest attempt to treat the social evil, not from a\r\nsentimental Philistine viewpoint.  A journalist of wide experience,\r\nMr. Kauffman proves that our industrial system leaves most women no\r\nalternative except prostitution.  The women portrayed in THE HOUSE OF\r\nBONDAGE belong to the working class.  Had the author portrayed the\r\nlife of women in other spheres, he would have been confronted with\r\nthe same state of affairs.\r\n\r\nNowhere is woman treated according to the merit of her work, but\r\nrather as a sex.  It is therefore almost inevitable that she should\r\npay for her right to exist, to keep a position in whatever line, with\r\nsex favors.  Thus it is merely a question of degree whether she sells\r\nherself to one man, in or out of marriage, or to many men.  Whether\r\nour reformers admit it or not, the economic and social inferiority of\r\nwoman is responsible for prostitution.\r\n\r\nJust at present our good people are shocked by the disclosures that\r\nin New York City alone, one out of every ten women works in a\r\nfactory, that the average wage received by women is six dollars per\r\nweek for forty-eight to sixty hours of work, and that the majority of\r\nfemale wage workers face many months of idleness which leaves the\r\naverage wage about $280 a year.  In view of these economic horrors,\r\nis it to be wondered at that prostitution and the white slave trade\r\nhave become such dominant factors?\r\n\r\nLest the preceding figures be considered an exaggeration, it is well\r\nto examine what some authorities on prostitution have to say:\r\n\r\n\"A prolific cause of female depravity can be found in the several\r\ntables, showing the description of the employment pursued, and the\r\nwages received, by the women previous to their fall, and it will be a\r\nquestion for the political economist to decide how far mere business\r\nconsideration should be an apology on the part of employers for a\r\nreduction in their rates of remuneration, and whether the savings of\r\na small percentage on wages is not more than counter-balanced by the\r\nenormous amount of taxation enforced on the public at large to defray\r\nthe expenses incurred on account of a system of vice, WHICH IS THE\r\nDIRECT RESULT, IN MANY CASES, OF INSUFFICIENT COMPENSATION OF HONEST\r\nLABOR.\"[1]\r\n\r\nOur present-day reformers would do well to look into Dr. Sanger's\r\nbook.  There they will find that out of 2,000 cases under his\r\nobservation, but few came from the middle classes, from well-ordered\r\nconditions, or pleasant homes.  By far the largest majority were\r\nworking girls and working women; some driven into prostitution\r\nthrough sheer want, others because of a cruel, wretched life at home,\r\nothers again because of thwarted and crippled physical natures (of\r\nwhich I shall speak later on).  Also it will do the maintainers of\r\npurity and morality good to learn that out of two thousand cases, 490\r\nwere married women, women who lived with their husbands.  Evidently\r\nthere was not much of a guaranty for their \"safety and purity\" in the\r\nsanctity of marriage.[2]\r\n\r\nDr. Alfred Blaschko, in PROSTITUTION IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY, is\r\neven more emphatic in characterizing economic conditions as one of\r\nthe most vital factors of prostitution.\r\n\r\n\"Although prostitution has existed in all ages, it was left to the\r\nnineteenth century to develop it into a gigantic social institution.\r\nThe development of industry with vast masses of people in the\r\ncompetitive market, the growth and congestion of large cities, the\r\ninsecurity and uncertainty of employment, has given prostitution an\r\nimpetus never dreamed of at any period in human history.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again Havelock Ellis, while not so absolute in dealing with the\r\neconomic cause, is nevertheless compelled to admit that it is\r\nindirectly and directly the main cause.  Thus he finds that a large\r\npercentage of prostitutes is recruited from the servant class,\r\nalthough the latter have less care and greater security.  On the\r\nother hand, Mr. Ellis does not deny that the daily routine, the\r\ndrudgery, the monotony of the servant girl's lot, and especially the\r\nfact that she may never partake of the companionship and joy of a\r\nhome, is no mean factor in forcing her to seek recreation and\r\nforgetfulness in the gaiety and glimmer of prostitution.  In other\r\nwords, the servant girl, being treated as a drudge, never having the\r\nright to herself, and worn out by the caprices of her mistress, can\r\nfind an outlet, like the factory or shopgirl, only in prostitution.\r\n\r\nThe most amusing side of the question now before the public is the\r\nindignation of our \"good, respectable people,\" especially the various\r\nChristian gentlemen, who are always to be found in the front ranks of\r\nevery crusade.  Is it that they are absolutely ignorant of the\r\nhistory of religion, and especially of the Christian religion?  Or is\r\nit that they hope to blind the present generation to the part played\r\nin the past by the Church in relation to prostitution?  Whatever\r\ntheir reason, they should be the last to cry out against the\r\nunfortunate victims of today, since it is known to every intelligent\r\nstudent that prostitution is of religious origin, maintained and\r\nfostered for many centuries, not as a shame but as a virtue, hailed\r\nas such by the Gods themselves.\r\n\r\n\"It would seem that the origin of prostitution is to be found\r\nprimarily in a religious custom, religion, the great conserver of\r\nsocial tradition, preserving in a transformed shape a primitive\r\nfreedom that was passing out of the general social life.  The typical\r\nexample is that recorded by Herodotus, in the fifth century before\r\nChrist, at the Temple of Mylitta, the Babylonian Venus, where every\r\nwoman, once in her life, had to come and give herself to the first\r\nstranger, who threw a coin in her lap, to worship the goddess.  Very\r\nsimilar customs existed in other parts of Western Asia, in North\r\nAfrica, in Cyprus, and other islands of the Eastern Mediterranean,\r\nand also in Greece, where the temple of Aphrodite on the fort at\r\nCorinth possessed over a thousand hierodules, dedicated to the\r\nservice of the goddess.\r\n\r\n\"The theory that religious prostitution developed, as a general rule,\r\nout of the belief that the generative activity of human beings\r\npossessed a mysterious and sacred influence in promoting the\r\nfertility of Nature, is maintained by all authoritative writers on\r\nthe subject.  Gradually, however, and when prostitution became an\r\norganized institution under priestly influence, religious\r\nprostitution developed utilitarian sides, thus helping to increase\r\npublic revenue.\r\n\r\n\"The rise of Christianity to political power produced little change\r\nin policy.  The leading fathers of the Church tolerated prostitution.\r\nBrothels under municipal protection are found in the thirteenth\r\ncentury.  They constituted a sort of public service, the directors of\r\nthem being considered almost as public servants.\"[3]\r\n\r\nTo this must be added the following from Dr. Sanger's work:\r\n\r\n\"Pope Clement II. issued a bull that prostitutes would be tolerated\r\nif they pay a certain amount of their earnings to the Church.\r\n\r\n\"Pope Sixtus IV. was more practical; from one single brothel, which\r\nhe himself had built, he received an income of 20,000 ducats.\"\r\n\r\nIn modern times the Church is a little more careful in that\r\ndirection.  At least she does not openly demand tribute from\r\nprostitutes.  She finds it much more profitable to go in for real\r\nestate, like Trinity Church, for instance, to rent out death traps at\r\nan exorbitant price to those who live off and by prostitution.\r\n\r\nMuch as I should like to, my space will not admit speaking of\r\nprostitution in Egypt, Greece, Rome, and during the Middle Ages.  The\r\nconditions in the latter period are particularly interesting,\r\ninasmuch as prostitution was organized into guilds, presided over by\r\na brothel Queen.  These guilds employed strikes as a medium of\r\nimproving their condition and keeping a standard price.  Certainly\r\nthat is more practical a method than the one used by the modern wage\r\nslave in society.\r\n\r\nIt would be one-sided and extremely superficial to maintain that the\r\neconomic factor is the only cause of prostitution.  There are others\r\nno less important and vital.  That, too, our reformers know, but dare\r\ndiscuss even less than the institution that saps the very life out of\r\nboth men and women.  I refer to the sex question, the very mention of\r\nwhich causes most people moral spasms.\r\n\r\nIt is a conceded fact that woman is being reared as a sex commodity,\r\nand yet she is kept in absolute ignorance of the meaning and\r\nimportance of sex.  Everything dealing with the subject is\r\nsuppressed, and persons who attempt to bring light into this terrible\r\ndarkness are persecuted and thrown into prison.  Yet it is\r\nnevertheless true that so long as a girl is not to know how to take\r\ncare of herself, not to know the function of the most important part\r\nof her life, we need not be surprised if she becomes an easy prey to\r\nprostitution, or to any other form of a relationship which degrades\r\nher to the position of an object for mere sex gratification.\r\n\r\nIt is due to this ignorance that the entire life and nature of the\r\ngirl is thwarted and crippled.  We have long ago taken it as a\r\nself-evident fact that the boy may follow the call of the wild; that\r\nis to say, that the boy may, as soon has his sex nature asserts\r\nitself, satisfy that nature; but our moralists are scandalized at the\r\nvery thought that the nature of a girl should assert itself.  To the\r\nmoralist prostitution does not consist so much in the fact that the\r\nwoman sells her body, but rather that she sells it out of wedlock.\r\nThat this is no mere statement is proved by the fact that marriage\r\nfor monetary considerations is perfectly legitimate, sanctified by\r\nlaw and public opinion, while any other union is condemned and\r\nrepudiated.  Yet a prostitute, if properly defined, means nothing\r\nelse than \"any person for whom sexual relationships are subordinated\r\nto gain.\"[4]\r\n\r\n\"Those women are prostitutes who sell their bodies for the exercise\r\nof the sexual act and make of this a profession.\"[5]\r\n\r\nIn fact, Banger goes further; he maintains that the act of\r\nprostitution is \"intrinsically equal to that of a man or woman who\r\ncontracts a marriage for economic reasons.\"\r\n\r\nOf course, marriage is the goal of every girl, but as thousands of\r\ngirls cannot marry, our stupid social customs condemn them either to\r\na life of celibacy or prostitution.  Human nature asserts itself\r\nregardless of all laws, nor is there any plausible reason why nature\r\nshould adapt itself to a perverted conception of morality.\r\n\r\nSociety considers the sex experiences of a man as attributes of his\r\ngeneral development, while similar experiences in the life of a woman\r\nare looked upon as a terrible calamity, a loss of honor and of all\r\nthat is good and noble in a human being.  This double standard of\r\nmorality has played no little part in the creation and perpetuation\r\nof prostitution.  It involves the keeping of the young in absolute\r\nignorance on sex matters, which alleged \"innocence,\" together with an\r\noverwrought and stifled sex nature, helps to bring about a state of\r\naffairs that our Puritans are so anxious to avoid or prevent.\r\n\r\nNot that the gratification of sex must needs lead to prostitution; it\r\nis the cruel, heartless, criminal persecution of those who dare\r\ndivert from the beaten paths, which is responsible for it.\r\n\r\nGirls, mere children, work in crowded, over-heated rooms ten to\r\ntwelve hours daily at a machine, which tends to keep them in a\r\nconstant over-excited sex state.  Many of these girls have no home or\r\ncomforts of any kind; therefore the street or some place of cheap\r\namusement is the only means of forgetting their daily routine.  This\r\nnaturally brings them into close proximity with the other sex.  It is\r\nhard to say which of the two factors brings the girl's over-sexed\r\ncondition to a climax, but it is certainly the most natural thing\r\nthat a climax should result.  That is the first step toward\r\nprostitution.  Nor is the girl to be held responsible for it.  On the\r\ncontrary, it is altogether the fault of society, the fault of our\r\nlack of understanding, of our lack of appreciation of life in the\r\nmaking; especially is it the criminal fault of our moralists, who\r\ncondemn a girl for all eternity, because she has gone from the \"path\r\nof virtue\"; that is, because her first sex experience has taken place\r\nwithout the sanction of the Church.\r\n\r\nThe girl feels herself a complete outcast, with the doors of home and\r\nsociety closed in her face.  Her entire training and tradition is\r\nsuch that the girl herself feels depraved and fallen, and therefore\r\nhas no ground to stand upon, or any hold that will lift her up,\r\ninstead of dragging her down.  Thus society creates the victims that\r\nit afterwards vainly attempts to get rid of.  The meanest, most\r\ndepraved and decrepit man still considers himself too good to take as\r\nhis wife the woman whose grace he was quite willing to buy, even\r\nthough he might thereby save her from a life of horror.  Nor can she\r\nturn to her own sister for help.  In her stupidity the latter deems\r\nherself too pure and chaste, not realizing that her own position is\r\nin many respects even more deplorable than her sister's of the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The wife who married for money, compared with the prostitute,\" says\r\nHavelock Ellis, \"is the true scab.  She is paid less, gives much more\r\nin return in labor and care, and is absolutely bound to her master.\r\nThe prostitute never signs away the right over her own person, she\r\nretains her freedom and personal rights, nor is she always compelled\r\nto submit to a man's embrace.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNor does the better-than-thou woman realize the apologist claim of\r\nLecky that \"though she may be the supreme type of vice, she is also\r\nthe most efficient guardian of virtue.  But for her, happy homes\r\nwould be polluted, unnatural and harmful practice would abound.\"\r\n\r\nMoralists are ever ready to sacrifice one-half of the human race for\r\nthe sake of some miserable institution which they can not outgrow.\r\nAs a matter of fact, prostitution is no more a safeguard for the\r\npurity of the home than rigid laws are a safeguard against\r\nprostitution.  Fully fifty per cent. of married men are patrons of\r\nbrothels.  It is through this virtuous element that the married\r\nwomen--nay, even the children--are infected with venereal diseases.\r\nYet society has not a word of condemnation for the man, while no law\r\nis too monstrous to be set in motion against the helpless victim.\r\nShe is not only preyed upon by those who use her, but she is also\r\nabsolutely at the mercy of every policeman and miserable detective on\r\nthe beat, the officials at the station house, the authorities in\r\nevery prison.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a recent book by a woman who was for twelve years the mistress of\r\na \"house,\" are to be found the following figures: \"The authorities\r\ncompelled me to pay every month fines between $14.70 to $29.70, the\r\ngirls would pay from $5.70 to $9.70 to the police.\"  Considering that\r\nthe writer did her business in a small city, that the amounts she\r\ngives do not include extra bribes and fines, one can readily see the\r\ntremendous revenue the police department derives from the blood money\r\nof its victims, whom it will not even protect.  Woe to those who\r\nrefuse to pay their toll; they would be rounded up like cattle, \"if\r\nonly to make a favorable impression upon the good citizens of the\r\ncity, or if the powers needed extra money on the side.  For the\r\nwarped mind who believes that a fallen woman is incapable of human\r\nemotion it would be impossible to realize the grief, the disgrace,\r\nthe tears, the wounded pride that was ours every time we were pulled\r\nin.\"\r\n\r\nStrange, isn't it, that a woman who has a kept a \"house\" should be\r\nable to feel that way?  But stranger still that a good Christian\r\nworld should bleed and fleece such women, and give them nothing in\r\nreturn except obloquy and persecution.  Oh, for the charity of a\r\nChristian world!\r\n\r\nMuch stress is laid on white slaves being imported into America.  How\r\nwould America ever retain her virtue if Europe did not help her out?\r\nI will not deny that this may be the case in some instances, any more\r\nthan I will deny that there are emissaries of Germany and other\r\ncountries luring economic slaves into America; but I absolutely deny\r\nthat prostitution is recruited to any appreciable extent from Europe.\r\nIt may be true that the majority of prostitutes in New York City are\r\nforeigners, but that is because the majority of the population is\r\nforeign.  The moment we go to any other American city, to Chicago or\r\nthe Middle West, we shall find that the number of foreign\r\nprostitutes is by far a minority.\r\n\r\nEqually exaggerated is the belief that the majority of street girls\r\nin this city were engaged in this business before they came to\r\nAmerica.  Most of the girls speak excellent English, are Americanized\r\nin habits and appearance,--a thing absolutely impossible unless they\r\nhad lived in this country many years.  That is, they were driven into\r\nprostitution by American conditions, by the thoroughly American\r\ncustom for excessive display of finery and clothes, which, of course,\r\nnecessitates money,--money that cannot be earned in shops or\r\nfactories.\r\n\r\nIn other words, there is no reason to believe that any set of men\r\nwould go to the risk and expense of getting foreign products, when\r\nAmerican conditions are overflooding the market with thousands of\r\ngirls.  On the other hand, there is sufficient evidence to prove that\r\nthe export of American girls for the purpose of prostitution is by no\r\nmeans a small factor.\r\n\r\nThus Clifford G. Roe, ex-Assistant State Attorney of Cook County,\r\nIll., makes the open charge that New England girls are shipped to\r\nPanama for the express use of men in the employ of Uncle Sam.  Mr.\r\nRoe adds that \"there seems to be an underground railroad between\r\nBoston and Washington which many girls travel.\"  Is it not\r\nsignificant that the railroad should lead to the very seat of Federal\r\nauthority?  That Mr. Roe said more than was desired in certain\r\nquarters is proved by the fact that he lost his position.  It is not\r\npractical for men in office to tell tales from school.\r\n\r\nThe excuse given for the conditions in Panama is that there are no\r\nbrothels in the Canal Zone.  That is the usual avenue of escape for a\r\nhypocritical world that dares not face the truth.  Not in the Canal\r\nZone, not in the city limits,--therefore prostitution does not exist.\r\n\r\nNext to Mr. Roe, there is James Bronson Reynolds, who has made a\r\nthorough study of the white slave traffic in Asia.  As a staunch\r\nAmerican citizen and friend of the future Napoleon of America,\r\nTheodore Roosevelt, he is surely the last to discredit the virtue of\r\nhis country.  Yet we are informed by him that in Hong Kong, Shanghai,\r\nand Yokohama, the Augean stables of American vice are located.  There\r\nAmerican prostitutes have made themselves so conspicuous that in the\r\nOrient \"American girl\" is synonymous with prostitute.  Mr. Reynolds\r\nreminds his countrymen that while Americans in China are under the\r\nprotection of our consular representatives, the Chinese in America\r\nhave no protection at all.  Every one who knows the brutal and\r\nbarbarous persecution Chinese and Japanese endure on the Pacific\r\nCoast, will agree with Mr. Reynolds.\r\n\r\nIn view of the above facts it is rather absurd to point to Europe as\r\nthe swamp whence come all the social diseases of America.  Just as\r\nabsurd is it to proclaim the myth that the Jews furnish the largest\r\ncontingent of willing prey.  I am sure that no one will accuse me of\r\nnationalistic tendencies.  I am glad to say that I have developed out\r\nof them, as out of many other prejudices.  If, therefore, I resent\r\nthe statement that Jewish prostitutes are imported, it is not because\r\nof any Judaistic sympathies, but because of the facts inherent in the\r\nlives of these people.  No one but the most superficial will claim\r\nthat Jewish girls migrate to strange lands, unless they have some tie\r\nor relation that brings them there.  The Jewish girl is not\r\nadventurous.  Until recent years she had never left home, not even so\r\nfar as the next village or town, except it were to visit some\r\nrelative.  Is it then credible that Jewish girls would leave their\r\nparents or families, travel thousands of miles to strange lands,\r\nthrough the influence and promises of strange forces?  Go to any of\r\nthe large incoming steamers and see for yourself if these girls do\r\nnot come either with their parents, brothers, aunts, or other\r\nkinsfolk.  There may be exceptions, of course, but to state that\r\nlarge numbers of Jewish girls are imported for prostitution, or any\r\nother purpose, is simply not to know Jewish psychology.\r\n\r\nThose who sit in a glass house do wrong to throw stones about them;\r\nbesides, the American glass house is rather thin, it will break\r\neasily, and the interior is anything but a gainly sight.\r\n\r\nTo ascribe the increase in prostitution to alleged importation, to\r\nthe growth of the cadet system, or similar causes, is highly\r\nsuperficial.  I have already referred to the former.  As to the cadet\r\nsystem, abhorrent as it is, we must not ignore the fact that it is\r\nessentially a phase of modern prostitution,--a phase accentuated by\r\nsuppression and graft, resulting from sporadic crusades against the\r\nsocial evil.\r\n\r\nThe procurer is no doubt a poor specimen of the human family, but in\r\nwhat manner is he more despicable than the policeman who takes the\r\nlast cent from the street walker, and then locks her up in the\r\nstation house?  Why is the cadet more criminal, or a greater menace\r\nto society, than the owners of department stores and factories, who\r\ngrow fat on the sweat of their victims, only to drive them to the\r\nstreets?  I make no plea for the cadet, but I fail to see why he\r\nshould be mercilessly hounded, while the real perpetrators of all\r\nsocial iniquity enjoy immunity and respect.  Then, too, it is well to\r\nremember that it is not the cadet who makes the prostitute.  It is\r\nour sham and hypocrisy that create both the prostitute and the cadet.\r\n\r\nUntil 1894 very little was known in America of the procurer.  Then we\r\nwere attacked by an epidemic of virtue.  Vice was to be abolished,\r\nthe country purified at all cost.  The social cancer was therefore\r\ndriven out of sight, but deeper into the body.  Keepers of brothels,\r\nas well as their unfortunate victims, were turned over to the tender\r\nmercies of the police.  The inevitable consequence of exorbitant\r\nbribes, and the penitentiary, followed.\r\n\r\nWhile comparatively protected in the brothels, where they represented\r\na certain monetary value, the girls now found themselves on the\r\nstreet, absolutely at the mercy of the graft-greedy police.\r\nDesperate, needing protection and longing for affection, these girls\r\nnaturally proved an easy prey for cadets, themselves the result of\r\nthe spirit of our commercial age.  Thus the cadet system was the\r\ndirect outgrowth of police persecution, graft, and attempted\r\nsuppression of prostitution.  It were sheer folly to confound this\r\nmodern phase of the social evil with the causes of the latter.\r\n\r\nMere suppression and barbaric enactments can serve but to embitter,\r\nand further degrade, the unfortunate victims of ignorance and\r\nstupidity.  The latter has reached its highest expression in the\r\nproposed law to make humane treatment of prostitutes a crime,\r\npunishing any one sheltering a prostitute with five years'\r\nimprisonment and $10,000 fine.  Such an attitude merely exposes the\r\nterrible lack of understanding of the true causes of prostitution, as\r\na social factor, as well as manifesting the Puritanic spirit of the\r\nScarlet Letter days.\r\n\r\nThere is not a single modern writer on the subject who does not refer\r\nto the utter futility of legislative methods in coping with the\r\nissue.  Thus Dr. Blaschko finds that governmental suppression and\r\nmoral crusades accomplish nothing save driving the evil into secret\r\nchannels, multiplying its dangers to society.  Havelock Ellis, the\r\nmost thorough and humane student of prostitution, proves by a wealth\r\nof data that the more stringent the methods of persecution the worse\r\nthe condition becomes.  Among other data we learn that in France, \"in\r\n1560, Charles IX. abolished brothels through an edict, but the\r\nnumbers of prostitutes were only increased, while many new brothels\r\nappeared in unsuspected shapes, and were more dangerous.  In spite of\r\nall such legislation, OR BECAUSE OF IT, there has been no country in\r\nwhich prostitution has played a more conspicuous part.\"[6]\r\n\r\nAn educated public opinion, freed from the legal and moral hounding\r\nof the prostitute, can alone help to ameliorate present conditions.\r\nWilful shutting of eyes and ignoring of the evil as a social factor\r\nof modern life, can but aggravate matters.  We must rise above our\r\nfoolish notions of \"better than thou,\" and learn to recognize in the\r\nprostitute a product of social conditions.  Such a realization will\r\nsweep away the attitude of hypocrisy, and insure a greater\r\nunderstanding and more humane treatment.  As to a thorough\r\neradication of prostitution, nothing can accomplish that save a\r\ncomplete transvaluation of all accepted values--especially the moral\r\nones--coupled with the abolition of industrial slavery.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Dr. Sanger, THE HISTORY OF PROSTITUTION.\r\n\r\n[2] It is a significant fact that Dr. Sanger's book has been excluded\r\nfrom the U. S. mails.  Evidently the authorities are not anxious that\r\nthe public be informed as to the true cause of prostitution.\r\n\r\n[3] Havelock Ellis, SEX AND SOCIETY.\r\n\r\n[4] Guyot, LA PROSTITUTION.\r\n\r\n[5] Banger, CRIMINALITE ET CONDITION ECONOMIQUE.\r\n\r\n[6] SEX AND SOCIETY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWOMAN SUFFRAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nWe boast of the age of advancement, of science, and progress.  Is it\r\nnot strange, then, that we still believe in fetich worship?  True,\r\nour fetiches have different form and substance, yet in their power\r\nover the human mind they are still as disastrous as were those of\r\nold.\r\n\r\nOur modern fetich is universal suffrage.  Those who have not yet\r\nachieved that goal fight bloody revolutions to obtain it, and those\r\nwho have enjoyed its reign bring heavy sacrifice to the altar of this\r\nomnipotent deity.  Woe to the heretic who dare question that\r\ndivinity!\r\n\r\nWoman, even more than man, is a fetich worshipper, and though her\r\nidols may change, she is ever on her knees, ever holding up her\r\nhands, ever blind to the fact that her god has feet of clay.  Thus\r\nwoman has been the greatest supporter of all deities from time\r\nimmemorial.  Thus, too, she has had to pay the price that only gods\r\ncan exact,--her freedom, her heart's blood, her very life.\r\n\r\nNietzsche's memorable maxim, \"When you go to woman, take the whip\r\nalong,\" is considered very brutal, yet Nietzsche expressed in one\r\nsentence the attitude of woman towards her gods.\r\n\r\nReligion, especially the Christian religion, has condemned woman to\r\nthe life of an inferior, a slave.  It has thwarted her nature and\r\nfettered her soul, yet the Christian religion has no greater\r\nsupporter, none more devout, than woman.  Indeed, it is safe to say\r\nthat religion would have long ceased to be a factor in the lives of\r\nthe people, if it were not for the support it receives from woman.\r\nThe most ardent churchworkers, the most tireless missionaries the\r\nworld over, are women, always sacrificing on the altar of the gods\r\nthat have chained her spirit and enslaved her body.\r\n\r\nThe insatiable monster, war, robs woman of all that is dear and\r\nprecious to her.  It exacts her brothers, lovers, sons, and in return\r\ngives her a life of loneliness and despair.  Yet the greatest\r\nsupporter and worshiper of war is woman.  She it is who instills the\r\nlove of conquest and power into her children; she it is who whispers\r\nthe glories of war into the ears of her little ones, and who rocks\r\nher baby to sleep with the tunes of trumpets and the noise of guns.\r\nIt is woman, too, who crowns the victor on his return from the\r\nbattlefield.  Yes, it is woman who pays the highest price to that\r\ninsatiable monster, war.\r\n\r\nThen there is the home.  What a terrible fetich it is!  How it saps\r\nthe very life-energy of woman,--this modern prison with golden bars.\r\nIts shining aspect blinds woman to the price she would have to pay as\r\nwife, mother, and housekeeper.  Yet woman clings tenaciously to the\r\nhome, to the power that holds her in bondage.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that because woman recognizes the awful toll she is\r\nmade to pay to the Church, State, and the home, she wants suffrage to\r\nset herself free.  That may be true of the few; the majority of\r\nsuffragists repudiate utterly such blasphemy.  On the contrary, they\r\ninsist always that it is woman suffrage which will make her a better\r\nChristian and homekeeper, a staunch citizen of the State.  Thus\r\nsuffrage is only a means of strengthening the omnipotence of the very\r\nGods that woman has served from time immemorial.\r\n\r\nWhat wonder, then, that she should be just as devout, just as\r\nzealous, just as prostrate before the new idol, woman suffrage.  As\r\nof old, she endures persecution, imprisonment, torture, and all forms\r\nof condemnation, with a smile on her face.  As of old, the most\r\nenlightened, even, hope for a miracle from the twentieth century\r\ndeity,--suffrage.  Life, happiness, joy, freedom, independence,--all\r\nthat, and more, is to spring from suffrage.  In her blind devotion\r\nwoman does not see what people of intellect perceived fifty years\r\nago: that suffrage is an evil, that it has only helped to enslave\r\npeople, that it has but closed their eyes that they may not see how\r\ncraftily they were made to submit.\r\n\r\nWoman's demand for equal suffrage is based largely on the contention\r\nthat woman must have the equal right in all affairs of society.  No\r\none could, possibly, refute that, if suffrage were a right.  Alas,\r\nfor the ignorance of the human mind, which can see a right in an\r\nimposition.  Or is it not the most brutal imposition for one set of\r\npeople to make laws that another set is coerced by force to obey?\r\nYet woman clamors for that \"golden opportunity\" that has wrought so\r\nmuch misery in the world, and robbed man of his integrity and\r\nself-reliance; an imposition which has thoroughly corrupted the\r\npeople, and made them absolute prey in the hands of unscrupulous\r\npoliticians.\r\n\r\nThe poor, stupid, free American citizen!  Free to starve, free to\r\ntramp the highways of this great country, he enjoys universal\r\nsuffrage, and, by that right, he has forged chains about his limbs.\r\nThe reward that he receives is stringent labor laws prohibiting the\r\nright of boycott, of picketing, in fact, of everything, except the\r\nright to be robbed of the fruits of his labor.  Yet all these\r\ndisastrous results of the twentieth century fetich have taught woman\r\nnothing.  But, then, woman will purify politics, we are assured.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, I am not opposed to woman suffrage on the\r\nconventional ground that she is not equal to it.  I see neither\r\nphysical, psychological, nor mental reasons why woman should not have\r\nthe equal right to vote with man.  But that can not possibly blind me\r\nto the absurd notion that woman will accomplish that wherein man has\r\nfailed.  If she would not make things worse, she certainly could not\r\nmake them better.  To assume, therefore, that she would succeed in\r\npurifying something which is not susceptible of purification, is to\r\ncredit her with supernatural powers.  Since woman's greatest\r\nmisfortune has been that she was looked upon as either angel or\r\ndevil, her true salvation lies in being placed on earth; namely, in\r\nbeing considered human, and therefore subject to all human follies\r\nand mistakes.  Are we, then, to believe that two errors will make a\r\nright?  Are we to assume that the poison already inherent in politics\r\nwill be decreased, if women were to enter the political arena?  The\r\nmost ardent suffragists would hardly maintain such a folly.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, the most advanced students of universal suffrage\r\nhave come to realize that all existing systems of political power are\r\nabsurd, and are completely inadequate to meet the pressing issues of\r\nlife.  This view is also borne out by a statement of one who is\r\nherself an ardent believer in woman suffrage, Dr. Helen L. Sumner.\r\nIn her able work on EQUAL SUFFRAGE, she says: \"In Colorado, we find\r\nthat equal suffrage serves to show in the most striking way the\r\nessential rottenness and degrading character of the existing system.\"\r\nOf course, Dr. Sumner has in mind a particular system of voting, but\r\nthe same applies with equal force to the entire machinery of the\r\nrepresentative system.  With such a basis, it is difficult to\r\nunderstand how woman, as a political factor, would benefit either\r\nherself or the rest of mankind.\r\n\r\nBut, say our suffrage devotees, look at the countries and States\r\nwhere female suffrage exists.  See what woman has accomplished--in\r\nAustralia, New Zealand, Finland, the Scandinavian countries, and in\r\nour own four States, Idaho, Colorado, Wyoming, and Utah.  Distance\r\nlends enchantment--or, to quote a Polish formula--\"it is well where\r\nwe are not.\"  Thus one would assume that those countries and States\r\nare unlike other countries or States, that they have greater\r\nfreedom, greater social and economic equality, a finer appreciation\r\nof human life, deeper understanding of the great social struggle,\r\nwith all the vital questions it involves for the human race.\r\n\r\nThe women of Australia and New Zealand can vote, and help make the\r\nlaws.  Are the labor conditions better there than they are in\r\nEngland, where the suffragettes are making such a heroic struggle?\r\nDoes there exist a greater motherhood, happier and freer children\r\nthan in England?  Is woman there no longer considered a mere sex\r\ncommodity?  Has she emancipated herself from the Puritanical double\r\nstandard of morality for men and women?  Certainly none but the\r\nordinary female stump politician will dare answer these questions in\r\nthe affirmative.  If that be so, it seems ridiculous to point to\r\nAustralia and New Zealand as the Mecca of equal suffrage\r\naccomplishments.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is a fact to those who know the real political\r\nconditions in Australia, that politics have gagged labor by enacting\r\nthe most stringent labor laws, making strikes without the sanction of\r\nan arbitration committee a crime equal to treason.\r\n\r\nNot for a moment do I mean to imply that woman suffrage is\r\nresponsible for this state of affairs.  I do mean, however, that\r\nthere is no reason to point to Australia as a wonder-worker of\r\nwoman's accomplishment, since her influence has been unable to free\r\nlabor from the thralldom of political bossism.\r\n\r\nFinland has given woman equal suffrage; nay, even the right to sit in\r\nParliament.  Has that helped to develop a greater heroism, an\r\nintenser zeal than that of the women of Russia?  Finland, like\r\nRussia, smarts under the terrible whip of the bloody Tsar.  Where are\r\nthe Finnish Perovskaias, Spiridonovas, Figners, Breshkovskaias?\r\nWhere are the countless numbers of Finnish young girls who cheerfully\r\ngo to Siberia for their cause?  Finland is sadly in need of heroic\r\nliberators.  Why has the ballot not created them?  The only Finnish\r\navenger of his people was a man, not a woman, and he used a more\r\neffective weapon than the ballot.\r\n\r\nAs to our own States where women vote, and which are constantly being\r\npointed out as examples of marvels, what has been accomplished there\r\nthrough the ballot that women do not to a large extent enjoy in other\r\nStates; or that they could not achieve through energetic efforts\r\nwithout the ballot?\r\n\r\nTrue, in the suffrage States women are guaranteed equal rights to\r\nproperty; but of what avail is that right to the mass of women\r\nwithout property, the thousands of wage workers, who live from hand\r\nto mouth?  That equal suffrage did not, and cannot, affect their\r\ncondition is admitted even by Dr. Sumner, who certainly is in a\r\nposition to know.  As an ardent suffragist, and having been sent to\r\nColorado by the Collegiate Equal Suffrage League of New York State to\r\ncollect material in favor of suffrage, she would be the last to say\r\nanything derogatory; yet we are informed that \"equal suffrage has but\r\nslightly affected the economic conditions of women.  That women do\r\nnot receive equal pay for equal work, and that, though woman in\r\nColorado has enjoyed school suffrage since 1876, women teachers are\r\npaid less than in California.\"  On the other hand, Miss Sumner fails\r\nto account for the fact that although women have had school suffrage\r\nfor thirty-four years, and equal suffrage since 1894, the census in\r\nDenver alone a few months ago disclosed the fact of fifteen thousand\r\ndefective school children.  And that, too, with mostly women in the\r\neducational department, and also notwithstanding that women in\r\nColorado have passed the \"most stringent laws for child and animal\r\nprotection.\"  The women of Colorado \"have taken great interest in the\r\nState institutions for the care of dependent, defective, and\r\ndelinquent children.\"  What a horrible indictment against woman's\r\ncare and interest, if one city has fifteen thousand defective\r\nchildren.  What about the glory of woman suffrage, since it has\r\nfailed utterly in the most important social issue, the child?  And\r\nwhere is the superior sense of justice that woman was to bring into\r\nthe political field?  Where was it in 1903, when the mine owners\r\nwaged a guerilla war against the Western Miners' Union; when General\r\nBell established a reign of terror, pulling men out of beds at night,\r\nkidnapping them across the border line, throwing them into bull pens,\r\ndeclaring \"to hell with the Constitution, the club is the\r\nConstitution\"?  Where were the women politicians then, and why did\r\nthey not exercise the power of their vote?  But they did.  They\r\nhelped to defeat the most fair-minded and liberal man, Governor\r\nWaite.  The latter had to make way for the tool of the mine kings,\r\nGovernor Peabody, the enemy of labor, the Tsar of Colorado.\r\n\"Certainly male suffrage could have done nothing worse.\"  Granted.\r\nWherein, then, are the advantages to woman and society from woman\r\nsuffrage?  The oft-repeated assertion that woman will purify politics\r\nis also but a myth.  It is not borne out by the people who know the\r\npolitical conditions of Idaho, Colorado, Wyoming, and Utah.\r\n\r\nWoman, essentially a purist, is naturally bigotted and relentless in\r\nher effort to make others as good as she thinks they ought to be.\r\nThus, in Idaho, she has disfranchised her sister of the street, and\r\ndeclared all women of \"lewd character\" unfit to vote.  \"Lewd\" not\r\nbeing interpreted, of course, as prostitution IN marriage.  It goes\r\nwithout saying that illegal prostitution and gambling have been\r\nprohibited.  In this regard the law must needs be of feminine nature:\r\nit always prohibits.  Therein all laws are wonderful.  They go no\r\nfurther, but their very tendencies open all the floodgates of hell.\r\nProstitution and gambling have never done a more flourishing business\r\nthan since the law has been set against them.\r\n\r\nIn Colorado, the Puritanism of woman has expressed itself in a more\r\ndrastic form.  \"Men of notoriously unclean lives, and men connected\r\nwith saloons, have been dropped from politics since women have the\r\nvote.\"[1]  Could brother Comstock do more?  Could all the Puritan\r\nfathers have done more?  I wonder how many women realize the gravity\r\nof this would-be feat.  I wonder if they understand that it is the\r\nvery thing which, instead of elevating woman, has made her a\r\npolitical spy, a contemptible pry into the private affairs of people,\r\nnot so much for the good of the cause, but because, as a Colorado\r\nwoman said, \"they like to get into houses they have never been in,\r\nand find out all they can, politically and otherwise.\"[2]  Yes, and\r\ninto the human soul and its minutest nooks and corners.  For nothing\r\nsatisfies the craving of most women so much as scandal.  And when did\r\nshe ever enjoy such opportunities as are hers, the politician's?\r\n\r\n\"Notoriously unclean lives, and men connected with the saloons.\"\r\nCertainly, the lady vote gatherers can not be accused of much sense\r\nof proportion.  Granting even that these busybodies can decide whose\r\nlives are clean enough for that eminently clean atmosphere, politics,\r\nmust it follow that saloon-keepers belong to the same category?\r\nUnless it be American hypocrisy and bigotry, so manifest in the\r\nprinciple of Prohibition, which sanctions the spread of drunkenness\r\namong men and women of the rich class, yet keeps vigilant watch on\r\nthe only place left to the poor man.  If no other reason, woman's\r\nnarrow and purist attitude toward life makes her a greater danger to\r\nliberty wherever she has political power.  Man has long overcome the\r\nsuperstitions that still engulf woman.  In the economic competitive\r\nfield, man has been compelled to exercise efficiency, judgment,\r\nability, competency.  He therefore had neither time nor inclination\r\nto measure everyone's morality with a Puritanic yardstick.  In his\r\npolitical activities, too, he has not gone about blindfolded.  He\r\nknows that quantity and not quality is the material for the political\r\ngrinding mill, and, unless he is a sentimental reformer or an old\r\nfossil, he knows that politics can never be anything but a swamp.\r\n\r\nWomen who are at all conversant with the process of politics, know\r\nthe nature of the beast, but in their self-sufficiency and egotism\r\nthey make themselves believe that they have but to pet the beast, and\r\nhe will become as gentle as a lamb, sweet and pure.  As if women have\r\nnot sold their votes, as if women politicians can not be bought!  If\r\nher body can be bought in return for material consideration, why not\r\nher vote?  That it is being done in Colorado and in other States, is\r\nnot denied even by those in favor of woman suffrage.\r\n\r\nAs I have said before, woman's narrow view of human affairs is not\r\nthe only argument against her as a politician superior to man.  There\r\nare others.  Her life-long economic parasitism has utterly blurred\r\nher conception of the meaning of equality.  She clamors for equal\r\nrights with men, yet we learn that \"few women care to canvas in\r\nundesirable districts.\"[3]  How little equality means to them compared\r\nwith the Russian women, who face hell itself for their ideal!\r\n\r\nWoman demands the same rights as man, yet she is indignant that her\r\npresence does not strike him dead: he smokes, keeps his hat on, and\r\ndoes not jump from his seat like a flunkey.  These may be trivial\r\nthings, but they are nevertheless the key to the nature of American\r\nsuffragists.  To be sure, their English sisters have outgrown these\r\nsilly notions.  They have shown themselves equal to the greatest\r\ndemands on their character and power of endurance.  All honor to the\r\nheroism and sturdiness of the English suffragettes.  Thanks to their\r\nenergetic, aggressive methods, they have proved an inspiration to some\r\nof our own lifeless and spineless ladies.  But after all, the\r\nsuffragettes, too, are still lacking in appreciation of real\r\nequality.  Else how is one to account for the tremendous, truly\r\ngigantic effort set in motion by those valiant fighters for a\r\nwretched little bill which will benefit a handful of propertied\r\nladies, with absolutely no provision for the vast mass of\r\nworkingwomen?  True, as politicians they must be opportunists, must\r\ntake half measures if they can not get all.  But as intelligent and\r\nliberal women they ought to realize that if the ballot is a weapon,\r\nthe disinherited need it more than the economically superior class,\r\nand that the latter already enjoy too much power by virtue of their\r\neconomic superiority.\r\n\r\nThe brilliant leader of the English suffragettes, Mrs. Emmeline\r\nPankhurst, herself admitted, when on her American lecture tour, that\r\nthere can be no equality between political superiors and inferiors.\r\nIf so, how will the workingwoman of England, already inferior\r\neconomically to the ladies who are benefited by the Shackleton bill,[4]\r\nbe able to work with their political superiors, should the bill pass?\r\nIs it not probable that the class of Annie Keeney, so full of zeal,\r\ndevotion, and martyrdom, will be compelled to carry on their backs\r\ntheir female political bosses, even as they are carrying their\r\neconomic masters.  They would still have to do it, were universal\r\nsuffrage for men and women established in England.  No matter what\r\nthe workers do, they are made to pay, always.  Still, those who\r\nbelieve in the power of the vote show little sense of justice when\r\nthey concern themselves not at all with those whom, as they claim, it\r\nmight serve most.\r\n\r\nThe American suffrage movement has been, until very recently,\r\naltogether a parlor affair, absolutely detached from the economic\r\nneeds of the people.  Thus Susan B. Anthony, no doubt an exceptional\r\ntype of woman, was not only indifferent but antagonistic to labor;\r\nnor did she hesitate to manifest her antagonism when, in 1869, she\r\nadvised women to take the places of striking printers in New York.[5]\r\nI do not know whether her attitude had changed before her death.\r\n\r\nThere are, of course, some suffragists who are affiliated with\r\nworkingwomen--the Women's Trade Union League, for instance; but they\r\nare a small minority, and their activities are essentially economic.\r\nThe rest look upon toil as a just provision of Providence.  What\r\nwould become of the rich, if not for the poor?  What would become of\r\nthese idle, parasitic ladies, who squander more in a week than their\r\nvictims earn in a year, if not for the eighty million wage workers?\r\nEquality, who ever heard of such a thing?\r\n\r\nFew countries have produced such arrogance and snobbishness as\r\nAmerica.  Particularly this is true of the American woman of the\r\nmiddle class.  She not only considers herself the equal of man, but\r\nhis superior, especially in her purity, goodness, and morality.\r\nSmall wonder that the American suffragist claims for her vote the\r\nmost miraculous powers.  In her exalted conceit she does not see how\r\ntruly enslaved she is, not so much by man, as by her own silly\r\nnotions and traditions.  Suffrage can not ameliorate that sad fact;\r\nit can only accentuate it, as indeed it does.\r\n\r\nOne of the great American women leaders claims that woman is entitled\r\nnot only to equal pay, but that she ought to be legally entitled even\r\nto the pay of her husband.  Failing to support her, he should be put\r\nin convict stripes, and his earnings in prison be collected by his\r\nequal wife.  Does not another brilliant exponent of the cause claim\r\nfor woman that her vote will abolish the social evil, which has been\r\nfought in vain by the collective efforts of the most illustrious\r\nminds the world over?  It is indeed to be regretted that the alleged\r\ncreator of the universe has already presented us with his wonderful\r\nscheme of things, else woman suffrage would surely enable woman to\r\noutdo him completely.\r\n\r\nNothing is so dangerous as the dissection of a fetich.  If we have\r\noutlived the time when such heresy was punishable at the stake, we\r\nhave not outlived the narrow spirit of condemnation of those who dare\r\ndiffer with accepted notions.  Therefore I shall probably be put down\r\nas an opponent of woman.  But that can not deter me from looking the\r\nquestion squarely in the face.  I repeat what I have said in the\r\nbeginning: I do not believe that woman will make politics worse; nor\r\ncan I believe that she could make it better.  If, then, she cannot\r\nimprove on man's mistakes, why perpetuate the latter?\r\n\r\nHistory may be a compilation of lies; nevertheless, it contains a few\r\ntruths, and they are the only guide we have for the future.  The\r\nhistory of the political activities of men proves that they have\r\ngiven him absolutely nothing that he could not have achieved in a\r\nmore direct, less costly, and more lasting manner.  As a matter of\r\nfact, every inch of ground he has gained has been through a constant\r\nfight, a ceaseless struggle for self-assertion, and not through\r\nsuffrage.  There is no reason whatever to assume that woman, in her\r\nclimb to emancipation, has been, or will be, helped by the ballot.\r\n\r\nIn the darkest of all countries, Russia, with her absolute despotism,\r\nwoman has become man's equal, not through the ballot, but by her will\r\nto be and to do.  Not only has she conquered for herself every avenue\r\nof learning and vocation, but she has won man's esteem, his respect,\r\nhis comradeship; aye, even more than that: she has gained the\r\nadmiration, the respect of the whole world.  That, too, not through\r\nsuffrage, but by her wonderful heroism, her fortitude, her ability,\r\nwill power, and her endurance in the struggle for liberty.  Where are\r\nthe women in any suffrage country or State that can lay claim to such\r\na victory?  When we consider the accomplishments of woman in America,\r\nwe find also that something deeper and more powerful than suffrage\r\nhas helped her in the march to emancipation.\r\n\r\nIt is just sixty-two years ago since a handful of women at the Seneca\r\nFalls Convention set forth a few demands for their right to equal\r\neducation with men, and access to the various professions, trades,\r\netc.  What wonderful accomplishment, what wonderful triumphs!  Who\r\nbut the most ignorant dare speak of woman as a mere domestic drudge?\r\nWho dare suggest that this or that profession should not be open to\r\nher?  For over sixty years she has molded a new atmosphere and a new\r\nlife for herself.  She has become a world power in every domain of\r\nhuman thought and activity.  And all that without suffrage, without\r\nthe right to make laws, without the \"privilege\" of becoming a judge,\r\na jailer, or an executioner.\r\n\r\nYes, I may be considered an enemy of woman; but if I can help her see\r\nthe light, I shall not complain.\r\n\r\nThe misfortune of woman is not that she is unable to do the work of\r\nman, but that she is wasting her life force to outdo him, with a\r\ntradition of centuries which has left her physically incapable of\r\nkeeping pace with him.  Oh, I know some have succeeded, but at what\r\ncost, at what terrific cost!  The import is not the kind of work\r\nwoman does, but rather the quality of the work she furnishes.  She\r\ncan give suffrage or the ballot no new quality, nor can she receive\r\nanything from it that will enhance her own quality.  Her development,\r\nher freedom, her independence, must come from and through herself.\r\nFirst, by asserting herself as a personality, and not as a sex\r\ncommodity.  Second, by refusing the right to anyone over her body; by\r\nrefusing to bear children, unless she wants them; by refusing to be a\r\nservant to God, the State, society, the husband, the family, etc.; by\r\nmaking her life simpler, but deeper and richer.  That is, by trying\r\nto learn the meaning and substance of life in all its complexities,\r\nby freeing herself from the fear of public opinion and public\r\ncondemnation.  Only that, and not the ballot, will set woman free,\r\nwill make her a force hitherto unknown in the world, a force for real\r\nlove, for peace, for harmony; a force of divine fire, of life giving;\r\na creator of free men and women.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] EQUAL SUFFRAGE.  Dr. Helen Sumner.\r\n\r\n[2] EQUAL SUFFRAGE.\r\n\r\n[3] Dr. Helen A. Sumner.\r\n\r\n[4] Mr. Shackleton was a labor leader.  It is therefore self-evident\r\nthat he should introduce a bill excluding his own constituents.  The\r\nEnglish Parliament is full of such Judases.\r\n\r\n[5] EQUAL SUFFRAGE.  Dr. Helen A. Sumner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRAGEDY OF WOMAN'S EMANCIPATION\r\n\r\n\r\nI begin with an admission: Regardless of all political and economic\r\ntheories, treating of the fundamental differences between various\r\ngroups within the human race, regardless of class and race\r\ndistinctions, regardless of all artificial boundary lines between\r\nwoman's rights and man's rights, I hold that there is a point where\r\nthese differentiations may meet and grow into one perfect whole.\r\n\r\nWith this I do not mean to propose a peace treaty.  The general\r\nsocial antagonism which has taken hold of our entire public life\r\ntoday, brought about through the force of opposing and contradictory\r\ninterests, will crumble to pieces when the reorganization of our\r\nsocial life, based upon the principles of economic justice, shall\r\nhave become a reality.\r\n\r\nPeace or harmony between the sexes and individuals does not\r\nnecessarily depend on a superficial equalization of human beings; nor\r\ndoes it call for the elimination of individual traits and\r\npeculiarities.  The problem that confronts us today, and which the\r\nnearest future is to solve, is how to be one's self and yet in\r\noneness with others, to feel deeply with all human beings and still\r\nretain one's own characteristic qualities.  This seems to me to be\r\nthe basis upon which the mass and the individual, the true democrat\r\nand the true individuality, man and woman, can meet without\r\nantagonism and opposition.  The motto should not be: Forgive one\r\nanother; rather, Understand one another.  The oft-quoted sentence of\r\nMadame de Stael: \"To understand everything means to forgive\r\neverything,\" has never particularly appealed to me; it has the odor\r\nof the confessional; to forgive one's fellow-being conveys the idea\r\nof pharisaical superiority.  To understand one's fellow-being\r\nsuffices.  The admission partly represents the fundamental aspect of\r\nmy views on the emancipation of woman and its effect upon the entire\r\nsex.\r\n\r\nEmancipation should make it possible for woman to be human in the\r\ntruest sense.  Everything within her that craves assertion and\r\nactivity should reach its fullest expression; all artificial barriers\r\nshould be broken, and the road towards greater freedom cleared of\r\nevery trace of centuries of submission and slavery.\r\n\r\nThis was the original aim of the movement for woman's emancipation.\r\nBut the results so far achieved have isolated woman and have robbed\r\nher of the fountain springs of that happiness which is so essential\r\nto her.  Merely external emancipation has made of the modern woman an\r\nartificial being, who reminds one of the products of French\r\narboriculture with its arabesque trees and shrubs, pyramids, wheels,\r\nand wreaths; anything, except the forms which would be reached by the\r\nexpression of her own inner qualities.  Such artificially grown\r\nplants of the female sex are to be found in large numbers, especially\r\nin the so-called intellectual sphere of our life.\r\n\r\nLiberty and equality for woman!  What hopes and aspirations these\r\nwords awakened when they were first uttered by some of the noblest\r\nand bravest souls of those days.  The sun in all his light and glory\r\nwas to rise upon a new world; in this world woman was to be free to\r\ndirect her own destiny--an aim certainly worthy of the great\r\nenthusiasm, courage, perseverance, and ceaseless effort of the\r\ntremendous host of pioneer men and women, who staked everything\r\nagainst a world of prejudice and ignorance.\r\n\r\nMy hopes also move towards that goal, but I hold that the\r\nemancipation of woman, as interpreted and practically applied today,\r\nhas failed to reach that great end.  Now, woman is confronted with\r\nthe necessity of emancipating herself from emancipation, if she\r\nreally desires to be free.  This may sound paradoxical, but is,\r\nnevertheless, only too true.\r\n\r\nWhat has she achieved through her emancipation?  Equal suffrage in a\r\nfew States.  Has that purified our political life, as many\r\nwell-meaning advocates predicted?  Certainly not.  Incidentally, it\r\nis really time that persons with plain, sound judgment should cease\r\nto talk about corruption in politics in a boarding-school tone.\r\nCorruption of politics has nothing to do with the morals, or the\r\nlaxity of morals, of various political personalities.  Its cause is\r\naltogether a material one.  Politics is the reflex of the business\r\nand industrial world, the mottos of which are: \"To take is more\r\nblessed than to give\"; \"buy cheap and sell dear\"; \"one soiled hand\r\nwashes the other.\"  There is no hope even that woman, with her right\r\nto vote, will ever purify politics.\r\n\r\nEmancipation has brought woman economic equality with man; that is,\r\nshe can choose her own profession and trade; but as her past and\r\npresent physical training has not equipped her with the necessary\r\nstrength to compete with man, she is often compelled to exhaust all\r\nher energy, use up her vitality, and strain every nerve in order to\r\nreach the market value.  Very few ever succeed, for it is a fact that\r\nwomen teachers, doctors, lawyers, architects, and engineers are\r\nneither met with the same confidence as their male colleagues, nor\r\nreceive equal remuneration.  And those that do reach that enticing\r\nequality, generally do so at the expense of their physical and\r\npsychical well-being.  As to the great mass of working girls and\r\nwomen, how much independence is gained if the narrowness and lack of\r\nfreedom of the home is exchanged for the narrowness and lack of\r\nfreedom of the factory, sweat-shop, department store, or office?  In\r\naddition is the burden which is laid on many women of looking after a\r\n\"home, sweet home\"--cold, dreary, disorderly, uninviting--after a\r\nday's hard work.  Glorious independence!  No wonder that hundreds of\r\ngirls are willing to accept the first offer of marriage, sick and\r\ntired of their \"independence\" behind the counter, at the sewing or\r\ntypewriting machine.  They are just as ready to marry as girls of the\r\nmiddle class, who long to throw off the yoke of parental supremacy.\r\nA so-called independence which leads only to earning the merest\r\nsubsistence is not so enticing, not so ideal, that one could expect\r\nwoman to sacrifice everything for it.  Our highly praised\r\nindependence is, after all, but a slow process of dulling and\r\nstifling woman's nature, her love instinct, and her mother instinct.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the position of the working girl is far more natural\r\nand human than that of her seemingly more fortunate sister in the\r\nmore cultured professional walks of life--teachers, physicians,\r\nlawyers, engineers, etc., who have to make a dignified, proper\r\nappearance, while the inner life is growing empty and dead.\r\n\r\nThe narrowness of the existing conception of woman's independence and\r\nemancipation; the dread of love for a man who is not her social\r\nequal; the fear that love will rob her of her freedom and\r\nindependence; the horror that love or the joy of motherhood will only\r\nhinder her in the full exercise of her profession--all these together\r\nmake of the emancipated modern woman a compulsory vestal, before whom\r\nlife, with its great clarifying sorrows and its deep, entrancing\r\njoys, rolls on without touching or gripping her soul.\r\n\r\nEmancipation, as understood by the majority of its adherents and\r\nexponents, is of too narrow a scope to permit the boundless love and\r\necstasy contained in the deep emotion of the true woman, sweetheart,\r\nmother, in freedom.\r\n\r\nThe tragedy of the self-supporting or economically free woman does\r\nnot lie in too many but in too few experiences.  True, she surpasses\r\nher sister of past generations in knowledge of the world and human\r\nnature; it is just because of this that she feels deeply the lack of\r\nlife's essence, which alone can enrich the human soul, and without\r\nwhich the majority of women have become mere professional automatons.\r\n\r\nThat such a state of affairs was bound to come was foreseen by those\r\nwho realized that, in the domain of ethics, there still remained many\r\ndecaying ruins of the time of the undisputed superiority of man;\r\nruins that are still considered useful.  And, what is more important,\r\na goodly number of the emancipated are unable to get along without\r\nthem.  Every movement that aims at the destruction of existing\r\ninstitutions and the replacement thereof with something more\r\nadvanced, more perfect, has followers who in theory stand for the\r\nmost radical ideas, but who, nevertheless, in their every-day\r\npractice, are like the average Philistine, feigning respectability\r\nand clamoring for the good opinion of their opponents.  There are,\r\nfor example, Socialists, and even Anarchists, who stand for the idea\r\nthat property is robbery, yet who will grow indignant if anyone owe\r\nthem the value of a half-dozen pins.\r\n\r\nThe same Philistine can be found in the movement for woman's\r\nemancipation.  Yellow journalists and milk-and-water litterateurs\r\nhave painted pictures of the emancipated woman that make the hair of\r\nthe good citizen and his dull companion stand up on end.  Every\r\nmember of the woman's rights movement was pictured as a George Sand\r\nin her absolute disregard of morality.  Nothing was sacred to her.\r\nShe had no respect for the ideal relation between man and woman.  In\r\nshort, emancipation stood only for a reckless life of lust and sin;\r\nregardless of society, religion, and morality.  The exponents of\r\nwoman's rights were highly indignant at such representation, and,\r\nlacking humor, they exerted all their energy to prove that they were\r\nnot at all as bad as they were painted, but the very reverse.  Of\r\ncourse, as long as woman was the slave of man, she could not be good\r\nand pure, but now that she was free and independent she would prove\r\nhow good she could be and that her influence would have a purifying\r\neffect on all institutions in society.  True, the movement for\r\nwoman's rights has broken many old fetters, but it has also forged\r\nnew ones.  The great movement of TRUE emancipation has not met with a\r\ngreat race of women who could look liberty in the face.  Their\r\nnarrow, Puritanical vision banished man, as a disturber and doubtful\r\ncharacter, out of their emotional life.  Man was not to be tolerated\r\nat any price, except perhaps as the father of a child, since a child\r\ncould not very well come to life without a father.  Fortunately, the\r\nmost rigid Puritans never will be strong enough to kill the innate\r\ncraving for motherhood.  But woman's freedom is closely allied with\r\nman's freedom, and many of my so-called emancipated sisters seem to\r\noverlook the fact that a child born in freedom needs the love and\r\ndevotion of each human being about him, man as well as woman.\r\nUnfortunately, it is this narrow conception of human relations that\r\nhas brought about a great tragedy in the lives of the modern man and\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\nAbout fifteen years ago appeared a work from the pen of the brilliant\r\nNorwegian, Laura Marholm, called WOMAN, A CHARACTER STUDY.  She was\r\none of the first to call attention to the emptiness and narrowness of\r\nthe existing conception of woman's emancipation, and its tragic\r\neffect upon the inner life of woman.  In her work Laura Marholm\r\nspeaks of the fate of several gifted women of international fame: the\r\ngenius, Eleonora Duse; the great mathematician and writer, Sonya\r\nKovalevskaia; the artist and poet-nature, Marie Bashkirtzeff, who\r\ndied so young.  Through each description of the lives of these women\r\nof such extraordinary mentality runs a marked trail of unsatisfied\r\ncraving for a full, rounded, complete, and beautiful life, and the\r\nunrest and loneliness resulting from the lack of it.  Through these\r\nmasterly psychological sketches, one cannot help but see that the\r\nhigher the mental development of woman, the less possible it is for\r\nher to meet a congenial mate who will see in her, not only sex, but\r\nalso the human being, the friend, the comrade and strong\r\nindividuality, who cannot and ought not lose a single trait of her\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nThe average man with his self-sufficiency, his ridiculously superior\r\nairs of patronage towards the female sex, is an impossibility for\r\nwoman as depicted in the CHARACTER STUDY by Laura Marholm.  Equally\r\nimpossible for her is the man who can see in her nothing more than\r\nher mentality and her genius, and who fails to awaken her woman\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nA rich intellect and a fine soul are usually considered necessary\r\nattributes of a deep and beautiful personality.  In the case of the\r\nmodern woman, these attributes serve as a hindrance to the complete\r\nassertion of her being.  For over a hundred years the old form of\r\nmarriage, based on the Bible, \"till death doth part,\" has been\r\ndenounced as an institution that stands for the sovereignty of the\r\nman over the woman, of her complete submission to his whims and\r\ncommands, and absolute dependence on his name and support.  Time and\r\nagain it has been conclusively proved that the old matrimonial\r\nrelation restricted woman to the function of a man's servant and the\r\nbearer of his children.  And yet we find many emancipated women who\r\nprefer marriage, with all its deficiencies, to the narrowness of an\r\nunmarried life; narrow and unendurable because of the chains of moral\r\nand social prejudice that cramp and bind her nature.\r\n\r\nThe explanation of such inconsistency on the part of many advanced\r\nwomen is to be found in the fact that they never truly understood the\r\nmeaning of emancipation.  They thought that all that was needed was\r\nindependence from external tyrannies; the internal tyrants, far more\r\nharmful to life and growth--ethical and social conventions--were left\r\nto take care of themselves; and they have taken care of themselves.\r\nThey seem to get along as beautifully in the heads and hearts of the\r\nmost active exponents of woman's emancipation, as in the heads and\r\nhearts of our grandmothers.\r\n\r\nThese internal tyrants, whether they be in the form of public opinion\r\nor what will mother say, or brother, father, aunt, or relative of any\r\nsort; what will Mrs. Grundy, Mr. Comstock, the employer, the Board of\r\nEducation say?  All these busybodies, moral detectives, jailers of\r\nthe human spirit, what will they say?  Until woman has learned to\r\ndefy them all, to stand firmly on her own ground and to insist upon\r\nher own unrestricted freedom, to listen to the voice of her nature,\r\nwhether it call for life's greatest treasure, love for a man, or her\r\nmost glorious privilege, the right to give birth to a child, she\r\ncannot call herself emancipated.  How many emancipated women are\r\nbrave enough to acknowledge that the voice of love is calling, wildly\r\nbeating against their breasts, demanding to be heard, to be\r\nsatisfied.\r\n\r\nThe French writer, Jean Reibrach, in one of his novels, NEW BEAUTY,\r\nattempts to picture the ideal, beautiful, emancipated woman.  This\r\nideal is embodied in a young girl, a physician.  She talks very\r\ncleverly and wisely of how to feed infants; she is kind, and\r\nadministers medicines free to poor mothers.  She converses with a\r\nyoung man of her acquaintance about the sanitary conditions of the\r\nfuture, and how various bacilli and germs shall be exterminated by\r\nthe use of stone walls and floors, and by the doing away with rugs\r\nand hangings.  She is, of course, very plainly and practically\r\ndressed, mostly in black.  The young man, who, at their first\r\nmeeting, was overawed by the wisdom of his emancipated friend,\r\ngradually learns to understand her, and recognizes one fine day that\r\nhe loves her.  They are young, and she is kind and beautiful, and\r\nthough always in rigid attire, her appearance is softened by a\r\nspotlessly clean white collar and cuffs.  One would expect that he\r\nwould tell her of his love, but he is not one to commit romantic\r\nabsurdities.  Poetry and the enthusiasm of love cover their blushing\r\nfaces before the pure beauty of the lady.  He silences the voice of\r\nhis nature, and remains correct.  She, too, is always exact, always\r\nrational, always well behaved.  I fear if they had formed a union,\r\nthe young man would have risked freezing to death.  I must confess\r\nthat I can see nothing beautiful in this new beauty, who is as cold\r\nas the stone walls and floors she dreams of.  Rather would I have the\r\nlove songs of romantic ages, rather Don Juan and Madame Venus, rather\r\nan elopement by ladder and rope on a moonlight night, followed by the\r\nfather's curse, mother's moans, and the moral comments of neighbors,\r\nthan correctness and propriety measured by yardsticks.  If love does\r\nnot know how to give and take without restrictions, it is not love,\r\nbut a transaction that never fails to lay stress on a plus and a\r\nminus.\r\n\r\nThe greatest shortcoming of the emancipation of the present day lies\r\nin its artificial stiffness and its narrow respectabilities, which\r\nproduce an emptiness in woman's soul that will not let her drink from\r\nthe fountain of life.  I once remarked that there seemed to be a\r\ndeeper relationship between the old-fashioned mother and hostess,\r\never on the alert for the happiness of her little ones and the\r\ncomfort of those she loved, and the truly new woman, than between\r\nthe latter and her average emancipated sister.  The disciples of\r\nemancipation pure and simple declared me a heathen, fit only for the\r\nstake.  Their blind zeal did not let them see that my comparison\r\nbetween the old and the new was merely to prove that a goodly number\r\nof our grandmothers had more blood in their veins, far more humor and\r\nwit, and certainly a greater amount of naturalness, kind-heartedness,\r\nand simplicity, than the majority of our emancipated professional\r\nwomen who fill the colleges, halls of learning, and various offices.\r\nThis does not mean a wish to return to the past, nor does it condemn\r\nwoman to her old sphere, the kitchen and the nursery.\r\n\r\nSalvation lies in an energetic march onward towards a brighter and\r\nclearer future.  We are in need of unhampered growth out of old\r\ntraditions and habits.  The movement for woman's emancipation has so\r\nfar made but the first step in that direction.  It is to be hoped\r\nthat it will gather strength to make another.  The right to vote, or\r\nequal civil rights, may be good demands, but true emancipation begins\r\nneither at the polls nor in courts.  It begins in woman's soul.\r\nHistory tells us that every oppressed class gained true liberation\r\nfrom its masters through its own efforts.  It is necessary that woman\r\nlearn that lesson, that she realize that her freedom will reach as\r\nfar as her power to achieve her freedom reaches.  It is, therefore,\r\nfar more important for her to begin with her inner regeneration, to\r\ncut loose from the weight of prejudices, traditions, and customs.\r\nThe demand for equal rights in every vocation of life is just and\r\nfair; but, after all, the most vital right is the right to love and\r\nbe loved.  Indeed, if partial emancipation is to become a complete\r\nand true emancipation of woman, it will have to do away with the\r\nridiculous notion that to be loved, to be sweetheart and mother, is\r\nsynonymous with being slave or subordinate.  It will have to do away\r\nwith the absurd notion of the dualism of the sexes, or that man and\r\nwoman represent two antagonistic worlds.\r\n\r\nPettiness separates; breadth unites.  Let us be broad and big.  Let\r\nus not overlook vital things because of the bulk of trifles\r\nconfronting us.  A true conception of the relation of the sexes will\r\nnot admit of conqueror and conquered; it knows of but one great\r\nthing: to give of one's self boundlessly, in order to find one's self\r\nricher, deeper, better.  That alone can fill the emptiness, and\r\ntransform the tragedy of woman's emancipation into joy, limitless\r\njoy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARRIAGE AND LOVE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe popular notion about marriage and love is that they are\r\nsynonymous, that they spring from the same motives, and cover the\r\nsame human needs.  Like most popular notions this also rests not on\r\nactual facts, but on superstition.\r\n\r\nMarriage and love have nothing in common; they are as far apart as\r\nthe poles; are, in fact, antagonistic to each other.  No doubt some\r\nmarriages have been the result of love.  Not, however, because love\r\ncould assert itself only in marriage; much rather is it because few\r\npeople can completely outgrow a convention.  There are today large\r\nnumbers of men and women to whom marriage is naught but a farce, but\r\nwho submit to it for the sake of public opinion.  At any rate, while\r\nit is true that some marriages are based on love, and while it is\r\nequally true that in some cases love continues in married life, I\r\nmaintain that it does so regardless of marriage, and not because of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is utterly false that love results from\r\nmarriage.  On rare occasions one does hear of a miraculous case of a\r\nmarried couple falling in love after marriage, but on close\r\nexamination it will be found that it is a mere adjustment to the\r\ninevitable.  Certainly the growing-used to each other is far away\r\nfrom the spontaneity, the intensity, and beauty of love, without\r\nwhich the intimacy of marriage must prove degrading to both the woman\r\nand the man.\r\n\r\nMarriage is primarily an economic arrangement, an insurance pact.  It\r\ndiffers from the ordinary life insurance agreement only in that it is\r\nmore binding, more exacting.  Its returns are insignificantly small\r\ncompared with the investments.  In taking out an insurance policy one\r\npays for it in dollars and cents, always at liberty to discontinue\r\npayments.  If, however, woman's premium is her husband, she pays for\r\nit with her name, her privacy, her self-respect, her very life,\r\n\"until death doth part.\"  Moreover, the marriage insurance condemns\r\nher to life-long dependency, to parasitism, to complete uselessness,\r\nindividual as well as social.  Man, too, pays his toll, but as his\r\nsphere is wider, marriage does not limit him as much as woman.  He\r\nfeels his chains more in an economic sense.\r\n\r\nThus Dante's motto over Inferno applies with equal force to marriage.\r\n\"Ye who enter here leave all hope behind.\"\r\n\r\nThat marriage is a failure none but the very stupid will deny.  One\r\nhas but to glance over the statistics of divorce to realize how\r\nbitter a failure marriage really is.  Nor will the stereotyped\r\nPhilistine argument that the laxity of divorce laws and the growing\r\nlooseness of woman account for the fact that: first, every twelfth\r\nmarriage ends in divorce; second, that since 1870 divorces have\r\nincreased from 28 to 73 for every hundred thousand population; third,\r\nthat adultery, since 1867, as ground for divorce, has increased 270.8\r\nper cent.; fourth, that desertion increased 369.8 per cent.\r\n\r\nAdded to these startling figures is a vast amount of material,\r\ndramatic and literary, further elucidating this subject.  Robert\r\nHerrick, in TOGETHER; Pinero, in MID-CHANNEL; Eugene Walter, in PAID\r\nIN FULL, and scores of other writers are discussing the barrenness,\r\nthe monotony, the sordidness, the inadequacy of marriage as a factor\r\nfor harmony and understanding.\r\n\r\nThe thoughtful social student will not content himself with the\r\npopular superficial excuse for this phenomenon.  He will have to dig\r\ndeeper into the very life of the sexes to know why marriage proves so\r\ndisastrous.\r\n\r\nEdward Carpenter says that behind every marriage stands the life-long\r\nenvironment of the two sexes; an environment so different from each\r\nother that man and woman must remain strangers.  Separated by an\r\ninsurmountable wall of superstition, custom, and habit, marriage has\r\nnot the potentiality of developing knowledge of, and respect for,\r\neach other, without which every union is doomed to failure.\r\n\r\nHenrik Ibsen, the hater of all social shams, was probably the first\r\nto realize this great truth.  Nora leaves her husband, not--as the\r\nstupid critic would have it--because she is tired of her\r\nresponsibilities or feels the need of woman's rights, but because she\r\nhas come to know that for eight years she had lived with a stranger\r\nand borne him children.  Can there be anything more humiliating, more\r\ndegrading than a life-long proximity between two strangers?  No need\r\nfor the woman to know anything of the man, save his income.  As to\r\nthe knowledge of the woman--what is there to know except that she has\r\na pleasing appearance?  We have not yet outgrown the theologic myth\r\nthat woman has no soul, that she is a mere appendix to man, made out\r\nof his rib just for the convenience of the gentleman who was so\r\nstrong that he was afraid of his own shadow.\r\n\r\nPerchance the poor quality of the material whence woman comes is\r\nresponsible for her inferiority.  At any rate, woman has no\r\nsoul--what is there to know about her?  Besides, the less soul a\r\nwoman has the greater her asset as a wife, the more readily will she\r\nabsorb herself in her husband.  It is this slavish acquiescence to\r\nman's superiority that has kept the marriage institution seemingly\r\nintact for so long a period.  Now that woman is coming into her own,\r\nnow that she is actually growing aware of herself as being outside\r\nof the master's grace, the sacred institution of marriage is\r\ngradually being undermined, and no amount of sentimental lamentation\r\ncan stay it.\r\n\r\nFrom infancy, almost, the average girl is told that marriage is her\r\nultimate goal; therefore her training and education must be directed\r\ntowards that end.  Like the mute beast fattened for slaughter, she is\r\nprepared for that.  Yet, strange to say, she is allowed to know much\r\nless about her function as wife and mother than the ordinary artisan\r\nof his trade.  It is indecent and filthy for a respectable girl to\r\nknow anything of the marital relation.  Oh, for the inconsistency of\r\nrespectability, that needs the marriage vow to turn something which\r\nis filthy into the purest and most sacred arrangement that none dare\r\nquestion or criticize.  Yet that is exactly the attitude of the\r\naverage upholder of marriage.  The prospective wife and mother is\r\nkept in complete ignorance of her only asset in the competitive\r\nfield--sex.  Thus she enters into life-long relations with a man only\r\nto find herself shocked, repelled, outraged beyond measure by the\r\nmost natural and healthy instinct, sex.  It is safe to say that a\r\nlarge percentage of the unhappiness, misery, distress, and physical\r\nsuffering of matrimony is due to the criminal ignorance in sex\r\nmatters that is being extolled as a great virtue.  Nor is it at all\r\nan exaggeration when I say that more than one home has been broken up\r\nbecause of this deplorable fact.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf, however, woman is free and big enough to learn the mystery of sex\r\nwithout the sanction of State or Church, she will stand condemned as\r\nutterly unfit to become the wife of a \"good\" man, his goodness\r\nconsisting of an empty brain and plenty of money.  Can there be\r\nanything more outrageous than the idea that a healthy, grown woman,\r\nfull of life and passion, must deny nature's demand, must subdue her\r\nmost intense craving, undermine her health and break her spirit, must\r\nstunt her vision, abstain from the depth and glory of sex experience\r\nuntil a \"good\" man comes along to take her unto himself as a wife?\r\nThat is precisely what marriage means.  How can such an arrangement\r\nend except in failure?  This is one, though not the least important,\r\nfactor of marriage, which differentiates it from love.\r\n\r\nOurs is a practical age.  The time when Romeo and Juliet risked the\r\nwrath of their fathers for love, when Gretchen exposed herself to the\r\ngossip of her neighbors for love, is no more.  If, on rare occasions,\r\nyoung people allow themselves the luxury of romance, they are taken\r\nin care by the elders, drilled and pounded until they become\r\n\"sensible.\"\r\n\r\nThe moral lesson instilled in the girl is not whether the man has\r\naroused her love, but rather is it, \"How much?\"  The important and\r\nonly God of practical American life: Can the man make a living? can\r\nhe support a wife?  That is the only thing that justifies marriage.\r\nGradually this saturates every thought of the girl; her dreams are\r\nnot of moonlight and kisses, of laughter and tears; she dreams of\r\nshopping tours and bargain counters.  This soul poverty and\r\nsordidness are the elements inherent in the marriage institution.\r\nThe State and Church approve of no other ideal, simply because it is\r\nthe one that necessitates the State and Church control of men and\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nDoubtless there are people who continue to consider love above\r\ndollars and cents.  Particularly this is true of that class whom\r\neconomic necessity has forced to become self-supporting.  The\r\ntremendous change in woman's position, wrought by that mighty factor,\r\nis indeed phenomenal when we reflect that it is but a short time\r\nsince she has entered the industrial arena.  Six million women wage\r\nworkers; six million women, who have equal right with men to be\r\nexploited, to be robbed, to go on strike; aye, to starve even.\r\nAnything more, my lord?  Yes, six million wage workers in every walk\r\nof life, from the highest brain work to the mines and railroad\r\ntracks; yes, even detectives and policemen.  Surely the emancipation\r\nis complete.\r\n\r\nYet with all that, but a very small number of the vast army of women\r\nwage workers look upon work as a permanent issue, in the same light\r\nas does man.  No matter how decrepit the latter, he has been taught\r\nto be independent, self-supporting.  Oh, I know that no one is really\r\nindependent in our economic treadmill; still, the poorest specimen of\r\na man hates to be a parasite; to be known as such, at any rate.\r\n\r\nThe woman considers her position as worker transitory, to be thrown\r\naside for the first bidder.  That is why it is infinitely harder to\r\norganize women than men.  \"Why should I join a union?  I am going to\r\nget married, to have a home.\"  Has she not been taught from infancy\r\nto look upon that as her ultimate calling?  She learns soon enough\r\nthat the home, though not so large a prison as the factory, has more\r\nsolid doors and bars.  It has a keeper so faithful that naught can\r\nescape him.  The most tragic part, however, is that the home no\r\nlonger frees her from wage slavery; it only increases her task.\r\n\r\nAccording to the latest statistics submitted before a Committee \"on\r\nlabor and wages, and congestion of population,\" ten per cent. of the\r\nwage workers in New York City alone are married, yet they must\r\ncontinue to work at the most poorly paid labor in the world.  Add to\r\nthis horrible aspect the drudgery of housework, and what remains of\r\nthe protection and glory of the home?  As a matter of fact, even the\r\nmiddle-class girl in marriage can not speak of her home, since it is\r\nthe man who creates her sphere.  It is not important whether the\r\nhusband is a brute or a darling.  What I wish to prove is that\r\nmarriage guarantees woman a home only by the grace of her husband.\r\nThere she moves about in HIS home, year after year, until her aspect\r\nof life and human affairs becomes as flat, narrow, and drab as her\r\nsurroundings.  Small wonder if she becomes a nag, petty, quarrelsome,\r\ngossipy, unbearable, thus driving the man from the house.  She could\r\nnot go, if she wanted to; there is no place to go.  Besides, a short\r\nperiod of married life, of complete surrender of all faculties,\r\nabsolutely incapacitates the average woman for the outside world.\r\nShe becomes reckless in appearance, clumsy in her movements,\r\ndependent in her decisions, cowardly in her judgment, a weight and a\r\nbore, which most men grow to hate and despise.  Wonderfully inspiring\r\natmosphere for the bearing of life, is it not?\r\n\r\nBut the child, how is it to be protected, if not for marriage?  After\r\nall, is not that the most important consideration?  The sham, the\r\nhypocrisy of it!  Marriage protecting the child, yet thousands of\r\nchildren destitute and homeless.  Marriage protecting the child, yet\r\norphan asylums and reformatories overcrowded, the Society for the\r\nPrevention of Cruelty to Children keeping busy in rescuing the little\r\nvictims from \"loving\" parents, to place them under more loving care,\r\nthe Gerry Society.  Oh, the mockery of it!\r\n\r\nMarriage may have the power to bring the horse to water, but has it\r\never made him drink?  The law will place the father under arrest, and\r\nput him in convict's clothes; but has that ever stilled the hunger of\r\nthe child?  If the parent has no work, or if he hides his identity,\r\nwhat does marriage do then?  It invokes the law to bring the man to\r\n\"justice,\" to put him safely behind closed doors; his labor, however,\r\ngoes not to the child, but to the State.  The child receives but a\r\nblighted memory of his father's stripes.\r\n\r\nAs to the protection of the woman,--therein lies the curse of\r\nmarriage.  Not that it really protects her, but the very idea is so\r\nrevolting, such an outrage and insult on life, so degrading to human\r\ndignity, as to forever condemn this parasitic institution.\r\n\r\nIt is like that other paternal arrangement--capitalism.  It robs man\r\nof his birthright, stunts his growth, poisons his body, keeps him in\r\nignorance, in poverty, and dependence, and then institutes charities\r\nthat thrive on the last vestige of man's self-respect.\r\n\r\nThe institution of marriage makes a parasite of woman, an absolute\r\ndependent.  It incapacitates her for life's struggle, annihilates her\r\nsocial consciousness, paralyzes her imagination, and then imposes its\r\ngracious protection, which is in reality a snare, a travesty on human\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nIf motherhood is the highest fulfillment of woman's nature, what\r\nother protection does it need, save love and freedom?  Marriage but\r\ndefiles, outrages, and corrupts her fulfillment.  Does it not say to\r\nwoman, Only when you follow me shall you bring forth life?  Does it\r\nnot condemn her to the block, does it not degrade and shame her if\r\nshe refuses to buy her right to motherhood by selling herself?  Does\r\nnot marriage only sanction motherhood, even though conceived in\r\nhatred, in compulsion?  Yet, if motherhood be of free choice, of\r\nlove, of ecstasy, of defiant passion, does it not place a crown of\r\nthorns upon an innocent head and carve in letters of blood the\r\nhideous epithet, Bastard?  Were marriage to contain all the virtues\r\nclaimed for it, its crimes against motherhood would exclude it\r\nforever from the realm of love.\r\n\r\nLove, the strongest and deepest element in all life, the harbinger of\r\nhope, of joy, of ecstasy; love, the defier of all laws, of all\r\nconventions; love, the freest, the most powerful moulder of human\r\ndestiny; how can such an all-compelling force be synonymous with that\r\npoor little State and Church-begotten weed, marriage?\r\n\r\nFree love?  As if love is anything but free!  Man has bought brains,\r\nbut all the millions in the world have failed to buy love.  Man has\r\nsubdued bodies, but all the power on earth has been unable to subdue\r\nlove.  Man has conquered whole nations, but all his armies could not\r\nconquer love.  Man has chained and fettered the spirit, but he has\r\nbeen utterly helpless before love.  High on a throne, with all the\r\nsplendor and pomp his gold can command, man is yet poor and desolate,\r\nif love passes him by.  And if it stays, the poorest hovel is radiant\r\nwith warmth, with life and color.  Thus love has the magic power to\r\nmake of a beggar a king.  Yes, love is free; it can dwell in no other\r\natmosphere.  In freedom it gives itself unreservedly, abundantly,\r\ncompletely.  All the laws on the statutes, all the courts in the\r\nuniverse, cannot tear it from the soil, once love has taken root.\r\nIf, however, the soil is sterile, how can marriage make it bear\r\nfruit?  It is like the last desperate struggle of fleeting life\r\nagainst death.\r\n\r\nLove needs no protection; it is its own protection.  So long as love\r\nbegets life no child is deserted, or hungry, or famished for the want\r\nof affection.  I know this to be true.  I know women who became\r\nmothers in freedom by the men they loved.  Few children in wedlock\r\nenjoy the care, the protection, the devotion free motherhood is\r\ncapable of bestowing.\r\n\r\nThe defenders of authority dread the advent of a free motherhood,\r\nlest it will rob them of their prey.  Who would fight wars?  Who\r\nwould create wealth?  Who would make the policeman, the jailer, if\r\nwoman were to refuse the indiscriminate breeding of children?  The\r\nrace, the race! shouts the king, the president, the capitalist, the\r\npriest.  The race must be preserved, though woman be degraded to a\r\nmere machine,--and the marriage institution is our only safety valve\r\nagainst the pernicious sex awakening of woman.  But in vain these\r\nfrantic efforts to maintain a state of bondage.  In vain, too, the\r\nedicts of the Church, the mad attacks of rulers, in vain even the arm\r\nof the law.  Woman no longer wants to be a party to the production of\r\na race of sickly, feeble, decrepit, wretched human beings, who have\r\nneither the strength nor moral courage to throw off the yoke of\r\npoverty and slavery.  Instead she desires fewer and better children,\r\nbegotten and reared in love and through free choice; not by\r\ncompulsion, as marriage imposes.  Our pseudo-moralists have yet to\r\nlearn the deep sense of responsibility toward the child, that love in\r\nfreedom has awakened in the breast of woman.  Rather would she forego\r\nforever the glory of motherhood than bring forth life in an\r\natmosphere that breathes only destruction and death.  And if she does\r\nbecome a mother, it is to give to the child the deepest and best her\r\nbeing can yield.  To grow with the child is her motto; she knows that\r\nin that manner alone can she help build true manhood and womanhood.\r\n\r\nIbsen must have had a vision of a free mother, when, with a master\r\nstroke, he portrayed Mrs. Alving.  She was the ideal mother because\r\nshe had outgrown marriage and all its horrors, because she had broken\r\nher chains, and set her spirit free to soar until it returned a\r\npersonality, regenerated and strong.  Alas, it was too late to rescue\r\nher life's joy, her Oswald; but not too late to realize that love in\r\nfreedom is the only condition of a beautiful life.  Those who, like\r\nMrs. Alving, have paid with blood and tears for their spiritual\r\nawakening, repudiate marriage as an imposition, a shallow, empty\r\nmockery.  They know, whether love last but one brief span of time or\r\nfor eternity, it is the only creative, inspiring, elevating basis for\r\na new race, a new world.\r\n\r\nIn our present pygmy state love is indeed a stranger to most people.\r\nMisunderstood and shunned, it rarely takes root; or if it does, it\r\nsoon withers and dies.  Its delicate fiber can not endure the stress\r\nand strain of the daily grind.  Its soul is too complex to adjust\r\nitself to the slimy woof of our social fabric.  It weeps and moans\r\nand suffers with those who have need of it, yet lack the capacity to\r\nrise to love's summit.\r\n\r\nSome day, some day men and women will rise, they will reach the\r\nmountain peak, they will meet big and strong and free, ready to\r\nreceive, to partake, and to bask in the golden rays of love.  What\r\nfancy, what imagination, what poetic genius can foresee even\r\napproximately the potentialities of such a force in the life of men\r\nand women.  If the world is ever to give birth to true companionship\r\nand oneness, not marriage, but love will be the parent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MODERN DRAMA: A POWERFUL DISSEMINATOR OF RADICAL THOUGHT\r\n\r\n\r\nSo long as discontent and unrest make themselves but dumbly felt\r\nwithin a limited social class, the powers of reaction may often\r\nsucceed in suppressing such manifestations.  But when the dumb unrest\r\ngrows into conscious expression and becomes almost universal, it\r\nnecessarily affects all phases of human thought and action, and seeks\r\nits individual and social expression in the gradual transvaluation of\r\nexisting values.\r\n\r\nAn adequate appreciation of the tremendous spread of the modern,\r\nconscious social unrest cannot be gained from merely propagandistic\r\nliterature.  Rather must we become conversant with the larger phases\r\nof human expression manifest in art, literature, and, above all, the\r\nmodern drama--the strongest and most far-reaching interpreter of our\r\ndeep-felt dissatisfaction.\r\n\r\nWhat a tremendous factor for the awakening of conscious discontent\r\nare the simple canvasses of a Millet!  The figures of his\r\npeasants--what terrific indictment against our social wrongs; wrongs\r\nthat condemn the Man With the Hoe to hopeless drudgery, himself\r\nexcluded from Nature's bounty.\r\n\r\nThe vision of a Meunier conceives the growing solidarity and defiance\r\nof labor in the group of miners carrying their maimed brother to\r\nsafety.  His genius thus powerfully portrays the interrelation of the\r\nseething unrest among those slaving in the bowels of the earth, and\r\nthe spiritual revolt that seeks artistic expression.\r\n\r\nNo less important is the factor for rebellious awakening in modern\r\nliterature--Turgeniev, Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy, Andreiev, Gorki,\r\nWhitman, Emerson, and scores of others embodying the spirit of\r\nuniversal ferment and the longing for social change.\r\n\r\nStill more far-reaching is the modern drama, as the leaven of radical\r\nthought and the disseminator of new values.\r\n\r\nIt might seem an exaggeration to ascribe to the modern drama such an\r\nimportant role.  But a study of the development of modern ideas in\r\nmost countries will prove that the drama has succeeded in driving\r\nhome great social truths, truths generally ignored when presented in\r\nother forms.  No doubt there are exceptions, as Russia and France.\r\n\r\nRussia, with its terrible political pressure, has made people think\r\nand has awakened their social sympathies, because of the tremendous\r\ncontrast which exists between the intellectual life of the people and\r\nthe despotic regime that is trying to crush that life.  Yet while the\r\ngreat dramatic works of Tolstoy, Tchechov, Gorki, and Andreiev\r\nclosely mirror the life and the struggle, the hopes and aspirations\r\nof the Russian people, they did not influence radical thought to the\r\nextent the drama has done in other countries.\r\n\r\nWho can deny, however, the tremendous influence exerted by THE POWER\r\nOF DARKNESS or NIGHT LODGING.  Tolstoy, the real, true Christian, is\r\nyet the greatest enemy of organized Christianity.  With a master hand\r\nhe portrays the destructive effects upon the human mind of the power\r\nof darkness, the superstitions of the Christian Church.\r\n\r\nWhat other medium could express, with such dramatic force, the\r\nresponsibility of the Church for crimes committed by its deluded\r\nvictims; what other medium could, in consequence, rouse the\r\nindignation of man's conscience?\r\n\r\nSimilarly direct and powerful is the indictment contained in Gorki's\r\nNIGHT LODGING.  The social pariahs, forced into poverty and crime,\r\nyet desperately clutch at the last vestiges of hope and aspiration.\r\nLost existences these, blighted and crushed by cruel, unsocial\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\nFrance, on the other hand, with her continuous struggle for liberty,\r\nis indeed the cradle of radical thought; as such she, too, did not\r\nneed the drama as a means of awakening.  And yet the works of\r\nBrieux--as ROBE ROUGE, portraying the terrible corruption of the\r\njudiciary--and Mirbeau's LES AFFAIRES SONT LES AFFAIRES--picturing\r\nthe destructive influence of wealth on the human soul--have\r\nundoubtedly reached wider circles than most of the articles and books\r\nwhich have been written in France on the social question.\r\n\r\nIn countries like Germany, Scandinavia, England, and even in\r\nAmerica--though in a lesser degree--the drama is the vehicle which is\r\nreally making history, disseminating radical thought in ranks not\r\notherwise to be reached.\r\n\r\nLet us take Germany, for instance.  For nearly a quarter of a century\r\nmen of brains, of ideas, and of the greatest integrity, made it their\r\nlife-work to spread the truth of human brotherhood, of justice, among\r\nthe oppressed and downtrodden.  Socialism, that tremendous\r\nrevolutionary wave, was to the victims of a merciless and inhumane\r\nsystem like water to the parched lips of the desert traveler.  Alas!\r\nThe cultured people remained absolutely indifferent; to them that\r\nrevolutionary tide was but the murmur of dissatisfied, discontented\r\nmen, dangerous, illiterate troublemakers, whose proper place was\r\nbehind prison bars.\r\n\r\nSelf-satisfied as the \"cultured\" usually are, they could not\r\nunderstand why one should fuss about the fact that thousands of\r\npeople were starving, though they contributed towards the wealth of\r\nthe world. Surrounded by beauty and luxury, they could not believe\r\nthat side by side with them lived human beings degraded to a position\r\nlower than a beast's, shelterless and ragged, without hope or\r\nambition.\r\n\r\nThis condition of affairs was particularly pronounced in Germany\r\nafter the Franco-German war.  Full to the bursting point with its\r\nvictory, Germany thrived on a sentimental, patriotic literature,\r\nthereby poisoning the minds of the country's youth by the glory of\r\nconquest and bloodshed.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Germany had to take refuge in the literature of other\r\ncountries, in the works of Ibsen, Zola, Daudet, Maupassant, and\r\nespecially in the great works of Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy, and Turgeniev.\r\nBut as no country can long maintain a standard of culture without a\r\nliterature and drama related to its own soil, so Germany gradually\r\nbegan to develop a drama reflecting the life and the struggles of its\r\nown people.\r\n\r\nArno Holz, one of the youngest dramatists of that period, startled\r\nthe Philistines out of their ease and comfort with his FAMILIE\r\nSELICKE.  The play deals with society's refuse, men and women of the\r\nalleys, whose only subsistence consists of what they can pick out of\r\nthe garbage barrels.  A gruesome subject, is it not?  And yet what\r\nother method is there to break through the hard shell of the minds\r\nand souls of people who have never known want, and who therefore\r\nassume that all is well in the world?\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, the play aroused tremendous indignation.  The truth\r\nis bitter, and the people living on the Fifth Avenue of Berlin hated\r\nto be confronted with the truth.\r\n\r\nNot that FAMILIE SELICKE represented anything that had not been\r\nwritten about for years without any seeming result.  But the dramatic\r\ngenius of Holz, together with the powerful interpretation of the\r\nplay, necessarily made inroads into the widest circles, and forced\r\npeople to think about the terrible inequalities around them.\r\n\r\nSudermann's EHRE[1] and HEIMAT[2] deal with vital subjects.  I have\r\nalready referred to the sentimental patriotism so completely turning\r\nthe head of the average German as to create a perverted conception of\r\nhonor.  Duelling became an every-day affair, costing innumerable\r\nlives.  A great cry was raised against the fad by a number of leading\r\nwriters.  But nothing acted as such a clarifier and exposer of that\r\nnational disease as the EHRE.\r\n\r\nNot that the play merely deals with duelling; it analyzes the real\r\nmeaning of honor, proving that it is not a fixed, inborn feeling, but\r\nthat it varies with every people and every epoch, depending\r\nparticularly on one's economic and social station in life.  We\r\nrealize from this play that the man in the brownstone mansion will\r\nnecessarily define honor differently from his victims.\r\n\r\nThe family Heinecke enjoys the charity of the millionaire Muhling,\r\nbeing permitted to occupy a dilapidated shanty on his premises in the\r\nabsence of their son, Robert.  The latter, as Muhling's\r\nrepresentative, is making a vast fortune for his employer in India.\r\nOn his return Robert discovers that his sister had been seduced by\r\nyoung Muhling, whose father graciously offers to straighten matters\r\nwith a check for 40,000 marks.  Robert, outraged and indignant,\r\nresents the insult to his family's honor, and is forthwith dismissed\r\nfrom his position for impudence.  Robert finally throws this\r\naccusation into the face of the philanthropist millionaire:\r\n\r\n\"We slave for you, we sacrifice our heart's blood for you, while you\r\nseduce our daughters and sisters and kindly pay for their disgrace\r\nwith the gold we have earned for you.  That is what you call honor.\"\r\n\r\nAn incidental side-light upon the conception of honor is given by\r\nCount Trast, the principal character in the EHRE, a man widely\r\nconversant with the customs of various climes, who relates that in\r\nhis many travels he chanced across a savage tribe whose honor he\r\nmortally offended by refusing the hospitality which offered him the\r\ncharms of the chieftain's wife.\r\n\r\nThe theme of HEIMAT treats of the struggle between the old and the\r\nyoung generations.  It holds a permanent and important place in\r\ndramatic literature.\r\n\r\nMagda, the daughter of Lieutenant Colonel Schwartz, has committed an\r\nunpardonable sin: she refused the suitor selected by her father.  For\r\ndaring to disobey the parental commands she is driven from home.\r\nMagda, full of life and the spirit of liberty, goes out into the\r\nworld to return to her native town, twelve years later, a celebrated\r\nsinger.  She consents to visit her parents on condition that they\r\nrespect the privacy of her past.  But her martinet father immediately\r\nbegins to question her, insisting on his \"paternal rights.\"  Magda is\r\nindignant, but gradually his persistence brings to light the tragedy\r\nof her life.  He learns that the respected Councillor Von Keller had\r\nin his student days been Magda's lover, while she was battling for\r\nher economic and social independence.  The consequence of the\r\nfleeting romance was a child, deserted by the man even before birth.\r\nThe rigid military father of Magda demands as retribution from\r\nCouncillor Von Keller that he legalize the love affair.  In view of\r\nMagda's social and professional success, Keller willingly consents,\r\nbut on condition that she forsake the stage, and place the child in\r\nan institution.  The struggle between the Old and the New culminates\r\nin Magda's defiant words of the woman grown to conscious independence\r\nof thought and action: \"...I'll say what I think of you--of you\r\nand your respectable society.  Why should I be worse than you that I\r\nmust prolong my existence among you by a lie!  Why should this gold\r\nupon my body, and the lustre which surrounds my name, only increase\r\nmy infamy?  Have I not worked early and late for ten long years?\r\nHave I not woven this dress with sleepless nights?  Have I not built\r\nup my career step by step, like thousands of my kind?  Why should I\r\nblush before anyone?  I am myself, and through myself I have become\r\nwhat I am.\"\r\n\r\nThe general theme of HEIMAT was not original.  It had been previously\r\ntreated by a master hand in FATHERS AND SONS.  Partly because\r\nTurgeniev's great work was typical rather of Russian than universal\r\nconditions, and still more because it was in the form of fiction, the\r\ninfluence of FATHERS AND SONS was limited to Russia.  But HEIMAT,\r\nespecially because of its dramatic expression, became almost a world\r\nfactor.\r\n\r\nThe dramatist who not only disseminated radicalism, but literally\r\nrevolutionized the thoughtful Germans, is Gerhardt Hauptmann.  His\r\nfirst play VOR SONNENAUFGANG[3], refused by every leading German\r\ntheatre and first performed in a wretched little playhouse behind a\r\nbeer garden, acted like a stroke of lightning, illuminating the\r\nentire social horizon.  Its subject matter deals with the life of an\r\nextensive landowner, ignorant, illiterate, and brutalized, and his\r\neconomic slaves of the same mental calibre.  The influence of wealth,\r\nboth on the victims who created it and the possessor thereof, is\r\nshown in the most vivid colors, as resulting in drunkenness, idiocy,\r\nand decay.  But the most striking feature of VOR SONNENAUFGANG, the\r\none which brought a shower of abuse on Hauptmann's head, was the\r\nquestion as to the indiscriminate breeding of children by unfit\r\nparents.\r\n\r\nDuring the second performance of the play a leading Berlin surgeon\r\nalmost caused a panic in the theatre by swinging a pair of forceps\r\nover his head and screaming at the top of his voice: \"The decency and\r\nmorality of Germany are at stake if childbirth is to be discussed\r\nopenly from the stage.\"  The surgeon is forgotten, and Hauptmann\r\nstands a colossal figure before the world.\r\n\r\nWhen DIE WEBER[4] first saw the light, pandemonium broke out in the\r\nland of thinkers and poets.  \"What,\" cried the moralists,\r\n\"workingmen, dirty, filthy slaves, to be put on the stage!  Poverty\r\nin all its horrors and ugliness to be dished out as an after-dinner\r\namusement?  That is too much!\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, it was too much for the fat and greasy bourgeoisie to be\r\nbrought face to face with the horrors of the weaver's existence.  It\r\nwas too much because of the truth and reality that rang like thunder\r\nin the deaf ears of self-satisfied society, J'ACCUSE!\r\n\r\nOf course, it was generally known even before the appearance of this\r\ndrama that capital can not get fat unless it devours labor, that\r\nwealth can not be hoarded except through the channels of poverty,\r\nhunger, and cold; but such things are better kept in the dark, lest\r\nthe victims awaken to a realization of their position.  But it is the\r\npurpose of the modern drama to rouse the consciousness of the\r\noppressed; and that, indeed, was the purpose of Gerhardt Hauptmann in\r\ndepicting to the world the conditions of the weavers in Silesia.\r\nHuman beings working eighteen hours daily, yet not earning enough for\r\nbread and fuel; human beings living in broken, wretched huts half\r\ncovered with snow, and nothing but tatters to protect them from the\r\ncold; infants covered with scurvy from hunger and exposure; pregnant\r\nwomen in the last stages of consumption.  Victims of a benevolent\r\nChristian era, without life, without hope, without warmth.  Ah, yes,\r\nit was too much!\r\n\r\nHauptmann's dramatic versatility deals with every stratum of social\r\nlife.  Besides portraying the grinding effect of economic conditions,\r\nhe also treats of the struggle of the individual for his mental and\r\nspiritual liberation from the slavery of convention and tradition.\r\nThus Heinrich, the bell-forger, in the dramatic prose-poem, DIE\r\nVERSUNKENE GLOCKE[5], fails to reach the mountain peaks of liberty\r\nbecause, as Rautendelein said, he had lived in the valley too long.\r\nSimilarly Dr. Vockerath and Anna Maar remain lonely souls because\r\nthey, too, lack the strength to defy venerated traditions.  Yet their\r\nvery failure must awaken the rebellious spirit against a world\r\nforever hindering individual and social emancipation.\r\n\r\nMax Halbe's JUGEND[6] and Wedekind's FRUHLING'S ERWACHEN[7] are dramas\r\nwhich have disseminated radical thought in an altogether different\r\ndirection.  They treat of the child and the dense ignorance and\r\nnarrow Puritanism that meet the awakening of nature.  Particularly\r\nthis is true of FRUHLING'S ERWACHEN.  Young boys and girls sacrificed\r\non the altar of false education and of our sickening morality that\r\nprohibits the enlightenment of youth as to questions so imperative to\r\nthe health and well-being of society,--the origin of life, and its\r\nfunctions.  It shows how a mother--and a truly good mother, at\r\nthat--keeps her fourteen-year-old daughter in absolute ignorance as\r\nto all matters of sex, and when finally the young girl falls a victim\r\nto her own ignorance, the same mother sees her daughter killed by\r\nquack medicines.  The inscription on her grave states that she died\r\nof anaemia, and morality is satisfied.\r\n\r\nThe fatality of our Puritanic hypocrisy in these matters is\r\nespecially illumined by Wedekind in so far as our most promising\r\nchildren fall victims to sex ignorance and the utter lack of\r\nappreciation on the part of the teachers of the child's awakening.\r\n\r\nWendla, unusually developed and alert for her age, pleads with her\r\nmother to explain the mystery of life:\r\n\r\n\"I have a sister who has been married for two and a half years.  I\r\nmyself have been made an aunt for the third time, and I haven't the\r\nleast idea how it all comes about....  Don't be cross, Mother,\r\ndear!  Whom in the world should I ask but you?  Don't scold me for\r\nasking about it.  Give me an answer.--How does it happen?--You cannot\r\nreally deceive yourself that I, who am fourteen years old, still\r\nbelieve in the stork.\"\r\n\r\nWere her mother herself not a victim of false notions of morality, an\r\naffectionate and sensible explanation might have saved her daughter.\r\nBut the conventional mother seeks to hide her \"moral\" shame and\r\nembarrassment in this evasive reply:\r\n\r\n\"In order to have a child--one must love--the man--to whom one is\r\nmarried....  One must love him, Wendla, as you at your age are\r\nstill unable to love.--Now you know it!\"\r\n\r\nHow much Wendla \"knew\" the mother realized too late.  The pregnant\r\ngirl imagines herself ill with dropsy.  And when her mother cries in\r\ndesperation, \"You haven't the dropsy, you have a child, girl,\" the\r\nagonized Wendla exclaims in bewilderment: \"But it's not possible,\r\nMother, I am not married yet....  Oh, Mother, why didn't you tell\r\nme everything?\"\r\n\r\nWith equal stupidity the boy Morris is driven to suicide because he\r\nfails in his school examinations.  And Melchior, the youthful father\r\nof Wendla's unborn child, is sent to the House of Correction, his\r\nearly sexual awakening stamping him a degenerate in the eyes of\r\nteachers and parents.\r\n\r\nFor years thoughtful men and women in Germany had advocated the\r\ncompelling necessity of sex enlightenment.  MUTTERSCHUTZ, a\r\npublication specially devoted to frank and intelligent discussion of\r\nthe sex problem, has been carrying on its agitation for a\r\nconsiderable time.  But it remained for the dramatic genius of\r\nWedekind to influence radical thought to the extent of forcing the\r\nintroduction of sex physiology in many schools of Germany.\r\n\r\nScandinavia, like Germany, was advanced through the drama much more\r\nthan through any other channel.  Long before Ibsen appeared on the\r\nscene, Bjornson, the great essayist, thundered against the\r\ninequalities and injustice prevalent in those countries.  But his was\r\na voice in the wilderness, reaching but the few.  Not so with Ibsen.\r\nHis BRAND, DOLL'S HOUSE, PILLARS OF SOCIETY, GHOSTS, and AN ENEMY OF\r\nTHE PEOPLE have considerably undermined the old conceptions, and\r\nreplaced them by a modern and real view of life.  One has but to read\r\nBRAND to realize the modern conception, let us say, of\r\nreligion,--religion, as an ideal to be achieved on earth; religion as\r\na principle of human brotherhood, of solidarity, and kindness.\r\n\r\nIbsen, the supreme hater of all social shams, has torn the veil of\r\nhypocrisy from their faces.  His greatest onslaught, however, is on\r\nthe four cardinal points supporting the flimsy network of society.\r\nFirst, the lie upon which rests the life of today; second, the\r\nfutility of sacrifice as preached by our moral codes; third, petty\r\nmaterial consideration, which is the only god the majority worships;\r\nand fourth, the deadening influence of provincialism.  These four\r\nrecur as the LEITMOTIF in Ibsen's plays, but particularly in PILLARS\r\nOF SOCIETY, DOLL'S HOUSE, GHOSTS, and AN ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE.\r\n\r\nPillars of Society!  What a tremendous indictment against the social\r\nstructure that rests on rotten and decayed pillars,--pillars nicely\r\ngilded and apparently intact, yet merely hiding their true condition.\r\nAnd what are these pillars?\r\n\r\nConsul Bernick, at the very height of his social and financial\r\ncareer, the benefactor of his town and the strongest pillar of the\r\ncommunity, has reached the summit through the channel of lies,\r\ndeception, and fraud.  He has robbed his bosom friend, Johann, of his\r\ngood name, and has betrayed Lona Hessel, the woman he loved, to marry\r\nher step-sister for the sake of her money.  He has enriched himself\r\nby shady transactions, under cover of \"the community's good,\" and\r\nfinally even goes to the extent of endangering human life by\r\npreparing the INDIAN GIRL, a rotten and dangerous vessel, to go to\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nBut the return of Lona brings him the realization of the emptiness\r\nand meanness of his narrow life.  He seeks to placate the waking\r\nconscience by the hope that he has cleared the ground for the better\r\nlife of his son, of the new generation.  But even this last hope soon\r\nfalls to the ground, as he realizes that truth cannot be built on a\r\nlie.  At the very moment when the whole town is prepared to celebrate\r\nthe great benefactor of the community with banquet praise, he\r\nhimself, now grown to full spiritual manhood, confesses to the\r\nassembled townspeople:\r\n\r\n\"I have no right to this homage-- ... My fellow-citizens must know\r\nme to the core.  Then let everyone examine himself, and let us\r\nrealize the prediction that from this event we begin a new time.  The\r\nold, with its tinsel, its hypocrisy, its hollowness, its lying\r\npropriety, and its pitiful cowardice, shall lie behind us like a\r\nmuseum, open for instruction.\"\r\n\r\nWith A DOLL'S HOUSE Ibsen has paved the way for woman's emancipation.\r\nNora awakens from her doll's role to the realization of the injustice\r\ndone her by her father and her husband, Helmer Torvald.\r\n\r\n\"While I was at home with father, he used to tell me all his\r\nopinions, and I held the same opinions.  If I had others I concealed\r\nthem, because he would not have approved.  He used to call me his\r\ndoll child, and play with me as I played with my dolls.  Then I came\r\nto live in your house.  You settled everything according to your\r\ntaste, and I got the same taste as you, or I pretended to.  When I\r\nlook back on it now, I seem to have been living like a beggar, from\r\nhand to mouth.  I lived by performing tricks for you, Torvald, but\r\nyou would have it so.  You and father have done me a great wrong.\"\r\n\r\nIn vain Helmer uses the old philistine arguments of wifely duty and\r\nsocial obligations.  Nora has grown out of her doll's dress into full\r\nstature of conscious womanhood.  She is determined to think and judge\r\nfor herself.  She has realized that, before all else, she is a human\r\nbeing, owing the first duty to herself.  She is undaunted even by the\r\npossibility of social ostracism.  She has become sceptical of the\r\njustice of the law, the wisdom of the constituted.  Her rebelling\r\nsoul rises in protest against the existing.  In her own words: \"I\r\nmust make up my mind which is right, society or I.\"\r\n\r\nIn her childlike faith in her husband she had hoped for the great\r\nmiracle.  But it was not the disappointed hope that opened her vision\r\nto the falsehoods of marriage.  It was rather the smug contentment of\r\nHelmer with a safe lie--one that would remain hidden and not endanger\r\nhis social standing.\r\n\r\nWhen Nora closed behind her the door of her gilded cage and went out\r\ninto the world a new, regenerated personality, she opened the gate of\r\nfreedom and truth for her own sex and the race to come.\r\n\r\nMore than any other play, GHOSTS has acted like a bomb explosion,\r\nshaking the social structure to its very foundations.\r\n\r\nIn DOLL'S HOUSE the justification of the union between Nora and\r\nHelmer rested at least on the husband's conception of integrity and\r\nrigid adherence to our social morality.  Indeed, he was the\r\nconventional ideal husband and devoted father.  Not so in GHOSTS.\r\nMrs. Alving married Captain Alving only to find that he was a\r\nphysical and mental wreck, and that life with him would mean utter\r\ndegradation and be fatal to possible offspring.  In her despair she\r\nturned to her youth's companion, young Pastor Manders who, as the\r\ntrue savior of souls for heaven, must needs be indifferent to earthly\r\nnecessities.  He sent her back to shame and degradation,--to her\r\nduties to husband and home.  Indeed, happiness--to him--was but the\r\nunholy manifestation of a rebellious spirit, and a wife's duty was\r\nnot to judge, but \"to bear with humility the cross which a higher\r\npower had for your own good laid upon you.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Alving bore the cross for twenty-six long years.  Not for the\r\nsake of the higher power, but for her little son Oswald, whom she\r\nlonged to save from the poisonous atmosphere of her husband's home.\r\n\r\nIt was also for the sake of the beloved son that she supported the\r\nlie of his father's goodness, in superstitious awe of \"duty and\r\ndecency.\"  She learned, alas! too late, that the sacrifice of her\r\nentire life had been in vain, and that her son Oswald was visited by\r\nthe sins of his father, that he was irrevocably doomed.  This, too,\r\nshe learned, that \"we are all of us ghosts.  It is not only what we\r\nhave inherited from our father and mother that walks in us.  It is\r\nall sorts of dead ideas and lifeless old beliefs.  They have no\r\nvitality, but they cling to us all the same and we can't get rid of\r\nthem....  And then we are, one and all, so pitifully afraid of\r\nlight.  When you forced me under the yoke you called Duty and\r\nObligation; when you praised as right and proper what my whole soul\r\nrebelled against as something loathsome; it was then that I began to\r\nlook into the seams of your doctrine.  I only wished to pick at a\r\nsingle knot, but when I had got that undone, the whole thing ravelled\r\nout.  And then I understood that it was all machine-sewn.\"\r\n\r\nHow could a society machine-sewn, fathom the seething depths whence\r\nissued the great masterpiece of Henrik Ibsen?  It could not\r\nunderstand, and therefore it poured the vials of abuse and venom upon\r\nits greatest benefactor.  That Ibsen was not daunted he has proved by\r\nhis reply in AN ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE.\r\n\r\nIn that great drama Ibsen performs the last funeral rites over a\r\ndecaying and dying social system.  Out of its ashes rises the\r\nregenerated individual, the bold and daring rebel.  Dr. Stockman, an\r\nidealist, full of social sympathy and solidarity, is called to his\r\nnative town as the physician of the baths.  He soon discovers that\r\nthe latter are built on a swamp, and that instead of finding relief\r\nthe patients, who flock to the place, are being poisoned.\r\n\r\nAn honest man, of strong convictions, the doctor considers it his\r\nduty to make his discovery known.  But he soon learns that dividends\r\nand profits are concerned neither with health nor principles.  Even\r\nthe reformers of the town, represented in the PEOPLE'S MESSENGER,\r\nalways ready to prate of their devotion to the people, withdraw their\r\nsupport from the \"reckless\" idealist, the moment they learn that the\r\ndoctor's discovery may bring the town into disrepute, and thus injure\r\ntheir pockets.\r\n\r\nBut Doctor Stockman continues in the faith he entertains for has\r\ntownsmen.  They would hear him.  But here, too, he soon finds himself\r\nalone.  He cannot even secure a place to proclaim his great truth.\r\nAnd when he finally succeeds, he is overwhelmed by abuse and ridicule\r\nas the enemy of the people.  The doctor, so enthusiastic of his\r\ntownspeople's assistance to eradicate the evil, is soon driven to a\r\nsolitary position.  The announcement of his discovery would result in\r\na pecuniary loss to the town, and that consideration induces the\r\nofficials, the good citizens, and soul reformers, to stifle the voice\r\nof truth.  He finds them all a compact majority, unscrupulous enough\r\nto be willing to build up the prosperity of the town on a quagmire of\r\nlies and fraud.  He is accused of trying to ruin the community.  But\r\nto his mind \"it does not matter if a lying community is ruined.  It\r\nmust be levelled to the ground.  All men who live upon lies must be\r\nexterminated like vermin.  You'll bring it to such a pass that the\r\nwhole country will deserve to perish.\"\r\n\r\nDoctor Stockman is not a practical politician.  A free man, he\r\nthinks, must not behave like a blackguard.  \"He must not so act that\r\nhe would spit in his own face.\"  For only cowards permit\r\n\"considerations\" of pretended general welfare or of party to override\r\ntruth and ideals.  \"Party programmes wring the necks of all young,\r\nliving truths; and considerations of expediency turn morality and\r\nrighteousness upside down, until life is simply hideous.\"\r\n\r\nThese plays of Ibsen--THE PILLARS OF SOCIETY, A DOLL'S HOUSE, GHOSTS,\r\nand AN ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE--constitute a dynamic force which is\r\ngradually dissipating the ghosts walking the social burying ground\r\ncalled civilization.  Nay, more; Ibsen's destructive effects are at\r\nthe same time supremely constructive, for he not merely undermines\r\nexisting pillars; indeed, he builds with sure strokes the foundation\r\nof a healthier, ideal future, based on the sovereignty of the\r\nindividual within a sympathetic social environment.\r\n\r\nEngland with her great pioneers of radical thought, the intellectual\r\npilgrims like Godwin, Robert Owen, Darwin, Spencer, William Morris,\r\nand scores of others; with her wonderful larks of liberty--Shelley,\r\nByron, Keats--is another example of the influence of dramatic art.\r\nWithin comparatively a few years, the dramatic works of Shaw, Pinero,\r\nGalsworthy, Rann Kennedy, have carried radical thought to the ears\r\nformerly deaf even to Great Britain's wondrous poets.  Thus a public\r\nwhich will remain indifferent reading an essay by Robert Owen, on\r\nPoverty, or ignore Bernard Shaw's Socialistic tracts, was made to\r\nthink by MAJOR BARBARA, wherein poverty is described as the greatest\r\ncrime of Christian civilization.  \"Poverty makes people weak,\r\nslavish, puny; poverty creates disease, crime, prostitution; in fine,\r\npoverty is responsible for all the ills and evils of the world.\"\r\nPoverty also necessitates dependency, charitable organizations,\r\ninstitutions that thrive off the very thing they are trying to\r\ndestroy.  The Salvation Army, for instance, as shown in MAJOR\r\nBARBARA, fights drunkenness; yet one of its greatest contributors is\r\nBadger, a whiskey distiller, who furnishes yearly thousands of pounds\r\nto do away with the very source of his wealth.  Bernard Shaw,\r\ntherefore, concludes that the only real benefactor of society is a\r\nman like Undershaft, Barbara's father, a cannon manufacturer, whose\r\ntheory of life is that powder is stronger than words.\r\n\r\n\"The worst of crimes,\" says Undershaft, \"is poverty.  All the other\r\ncrimes are virtues beside it; all the other dishonors are chivalry\r\nitself by comparison.  Poverty blights whole cities; spreads horrible\r\npestilences; strikes dead the very soul of all who come within sight,\r\nsound, or smell of it.  What you call crime is nothing; a murder\r\nhere, a theft there, a blow now and a curse there: what do they\r\nmatter?  They are only the accidents and illnesses of life; there are\r\nnot fifty genuine professional criminals in London.  But there are\r\nmillions of poor people, abject people, dirty people, ill-fed,\r\nill-clothed people.  They poison us morally and physically; they kill\r\nthe happiness of society; they force us to do away with our own\r\nliberties and to organize unnatural cruelties for fear they should\r\nrise against us and drag us down into their abyss....  Poverty and\r\nslavery have stood up for centuries to your sermons and leading\r\narticles; they will not stand up to my machine guns.  Don't preach at\r\nthem; don't reason with them.  Kill them....  It is the final test\r\nof conviction, the only lever strong enough to overturn a social\r\nsystem....  Vote!  Bah!  When you vote, you only change the name\r\nof the cabinet.  When you shoot, you pull down governments,\r\ninaugurate new epochs, abolish old orders, and set up new.\"\r\n\r\nNo wonder people cared little to read Mr. Shaw's Socialistic tracts.\r\nIn no other way but in the drama could he deliver such forcible,\r\nhistoric truths.  And therefore it is only through the drama that Mr.\r\nShaw is a revolutionary factor in the dissemination of radical ideas.\r\n\r\nAfter Hauptmann's DIE WEBER, STRIFE, by Galsworthy, is the most\r\nimportant labor drama.\r\n\r\nThe theme of STRIFE is a strike with two dominant factors: Anthony,\r\nthe president of the company, rigid, uncompromising, unwilling to\r\nmake the slightest concession, although the men held out for months\r\nand are in a condition of semi-starvation; and David Roberts, an\r\nuncompromising revolutionist, whose devotion to the workingman and\r\nthe cause of freedom is at white heat.  Between them the strikers are\r\nworn and weary with the terrible struggle, and are harassed and\r\ndriven by the awful sight of poverty and want in their families.\r\n\r\nThe most marvellous and brilliant piece of work in STRIFE is\r\nGalsworthy's portrayal of the mob, its fickleness, and lack of\r\nbackbone.  One moment they applaud old Thomas, who speaks of the\r\npower of God and religion and admonishes the men against rebellion;\r\nthe next instant they are carried away by a walking delegate, who\r\npleads the cause of the union,--the union that always stands for\r\ncompromise, and which forsakes the workingmen whenever they dare to\r\nstrike for independent demands; again they are aglow with the\r\nearnestness, the spirit, and the intensity of David Roberts--all\r\nthese people willing to go in whatever direction the wind blows.  It\r\nis the curse of the working class that they always follow like sheep\r\nled to slaughter.\r\n\r\nConsistency is the greatest crime of our commercial age.  No matter\r\nhow intense the spirit or how important the man, the moment he will\r\nnot allow himself to be used or sell his principles, he is thrown on\r\nthe dustheap.  Such was the fate of the president of the company,\r\nAnthony, and of David Roberts.  To be sure they represented opposite\r\npoles--poles antagonistic to each other, poles divided by a terrible\r\ngap that can never be bridged over.  Yet they shared a common fate.\r\nAnthony is the embodiment of conservatism, of old ideas, of iron\r\nmethods:\r\n\r\n\"I have been chairman of this company thirty-two years.  I have\r\nfought the men four times.  I have never been defeated.  It has been\r\nsaid that times have changed.  If they have, I have not changed with\r\nthem.  It has been said that masters and men are equal.  Cant.  There\r\ncan be only one master in a house.  It has been said that Capital and\r\nLabor have the same interests.  Cant.  Their interests are as wide\r\nasunder as the poles.  There is only one way of treating men--with\r\nthe iron rod.  Masters are masters.  Men are men.\"\r\n\r\nWe may not like this adherence to old, reactionary notions, and yet\r\nthere is something admirable in the courage and consistency of this\r\nman, nor is he half as dangerous to the interests of the oppressed,\r\nas our sentimental and soft reformers who rob with nine fingers, and\r\ngive libraries with the tenth; who grind human beings like Russell\r\nSage, and then spend millions of dollars in social research work; who\r\nturn beautiful young plants into faded old women, and then give them\r\na few paltry dollars or found a Home for Working Girls.  Anthony is a\r\nworthy foe; and to fight such a foe, one must learn to meet him in\r\nopen battle.\r\n\r\nDavid Roberts has all the mental and moral attributes of his\r\nadversary, coupled with the spirit of revolt, and the depth of modern\r\nideas.  He, too, is consistent, and wants nothing for his class short\r\nof complete victory.\r\n\r\n\"It is not for this little moment of time we are fighting, not for\r\nour own little bodies and their warmth; it is for all those who come\r\nafter, for all times.  Oh, men, for the love of them don't turn up\r\nanother stone on their heads, don't help to blacken the sky.  If we\r\ncan shake that white-faced monster with the bloody lips that has\r\nsucked the lives out of ourselves, our wives, and children, since the\r\nworld began, if we have not the hearts of men to stand against it,\r\nbreast to breast and eye to eye, and force it backward till it cry\r\nfor mercy, it will go on sucking life, and we shall stay forever\r\nwhere we are, less than the very dogs.\"\r\n\r\nIt is inevitable that compromise and petty interest should pass on\r\nand leave two such giants behind.  Inevitable, until the mass will\r\nreach the stature of a David Roberts.  Will it ever?  Prophecy is not\r\nthe vocation of the dramatist, yet the moral lesson is evident.  One\r\ncannot help realizing that the workingmen will have to use methods\r\nhitherto unfamiliar to them; that they will have to discard all those\r\nelements in their midst that are forever ready to reconcile the\r\nirreconcilable, namely Capital and Labor.  They will have to learn\r\nthat characters like David Roberts are the very forces that have\r\nrevolutionized the world and thus paved the way for emancipation out\r\nof the clutches of that \"white-faced monster with bloody lips,\"\r\ntowards a brighter horizon, a freer life, and a deeper recognition of\r\nhuman values.\r\n\r\nNo subject of equal social import has received such extensive\r\nconsideration within the last few years as the question of prison and\r\npunishment.\r\n\r\nHardly any magazine of consequence that has not devoted its columns\r\nto the discussion of this vital theme.  A number of books by able\r\nwriters, both in America and abroad, have discussed this topic from\r\nthe historic, psychologic, and social standpoint, all agreeing that\r\npresent penal institutions and our mode of coping with crime have in\r\nevery respect proved inadequate as well as wasteful.  One would\r\nexpect that something very radical should result from the cumulative\r\nliterary indictment of the social crimes perpetrated upon the\r\nprisoner.  Yet with the exception of a few minor and comparatively\r\ninsignificant reforms in some of our prisons, absolutely nothing has\r\nbeen accomplished.  But at last this grave social wrong has found\r\ndramatic interpretation in Galworthy's JUSTICE.\r\n\r\nThe play opens in the office of James How and Sons, Solicitors.  The\r\nsenior clerk, Robert Cokeson, discovers that a check he had issued\r\nfor nine pounds has been forged to ninety.  By elimination, suspicion\r\nfalls upon William Falder, the junior office clerk.  The latter is in\r\nlove with a married woman, the abused, ill-treated wife of a brutal\r\ndrunkard.  Pressed by his employer, a severe yet not unkindly man,\r\nFalder confesses the forgery, pleading the dire necessity of his\r\nsweetheart, Ruth Honeywill, with whom he had planned to escape to\r\nsave her from the unbearable brutality of her husband.\r\nNotwithstanding the entreaties of young Walter, who is touched by\r\nmodern ideas, his father, a moral and law-respecting citizen, turns\r\nFalder over to the police.\r\n\r\nThe second act, in the court-room, shows Justice in the very process\r\nof manufacture.  The scene equals in dramatic power and psychologic\r\nverity the great court scene in RESURRECTION.  Young Falder, a\r\nnervous and rather weakly youth of twenty-three, stands before the\r\nbar.  Ruth, his married sweetheart, full of love and devotion, burns\r\nwith anxiety to save the young man whose affection brought about his\r\npresent predicament.  The young man is defended by Lawyer Frome,\r\nwhose speech to the jury is a masterpiece of deep social philosophy\r\nwreathed with the tendrils of human understanding and sympathy.  He\r\ndoes not attempt to dispute the mere fact of Falder having altered\r\nthe check; and though he pleads temporary aberration in defense of\r\nhis client, that plea is based upon a social consciousness as deep\r\nand all-embracing as the roots of our social ills--\"the background of\r\nlife, that palpitating life which always lies behind the commission\r\nof a crime.\"  He shows Falder to have faced the alternative of seeing\r\nthe beloved woman murdered by her brutal husband, whom she cannot\r\ndivorce; or of taking the law into his own hands.  The defence pleads\r\nwith the jury not to turn the weak young man into a criminal by\r\ncondemning him to prison, for \"justice is a machine that, when\r\nsomeone has given it a starting push, rolls on of itself....  Is\r\nthis young man to be ground to pieces under this machine for an act\r\nwhich, at the worst, was one of weakness?  Is he to become a member\r\nof the luckless crews that man those dark, ill-starred ships called\r\nprisons?...  I urge you, gentlemen, do not ruin this young man.\r\nFor as a result of those four minutes, ruin, utter and irretrievable,\r\nstares him in the face....  The rolling of the chariot wheels of\r\nJustice over this boy began when it was decided to prosecute him.\"\r\n\r\nBut the chariot of Justice rolls mercilessly on, for--as the learned\r\nJudge says--\"the law is what it is--a majestic edifice, sheltering\r\nall of us, each stone of which rests on another.\"\r\n\r\nFalder is sentenced to three years' penal servitude.\r\n\r\nIn prison, the young, inexperienced convict soon finds himself the\r\nvictim of the terrible \"system.\"  The authorities admit that young\r\nFalder is mentally and physically \"in bad shape,\" but nothing can be\r\ndone in the matter: many others are in a similar position, and \"the\r\nquarters are inadequate.\"\r\n\r\nThe third scene of the third act is heart-gripping in its silent\r\nforce.  The whole scene is a pantomime, taking place in Falder's\r\nprison cell.\r\n\r\n\"In fast-falling daylight, Falder, in his stockings, is seen standing\r\nmotionless, with his head inclined towards the door, listening.  He\r\nmoves a little closer to the door, his stockinged feet making no\r\nnoise.  He stops at the door.  He is trying harder and harder to hear\r\nsomething, any little thing that is going on outside.  He springs\r\nsuddenly upright--as if at a sound--and remains perfectly motionless.\r\nThen, with a heavy sigh, he moves to his work, and stands looking at\r\nit, with his head down; he does a stitch or two, having the air of a\r\nman so lost in sadness that each stitch is, as it were, a coming to\r\nlife.  Then, turning abruptly, he begins pacing his cell, moving his\r\nhead, like an animal pacing its cage.  He stops again at the door,\r\nlistens, and, placing the palms of his hands against it with his\r\nfingers spread out, leans his forehead against the iron.  Turning\r\nfrom it, presently, he moves slowly back towards the window, holding\r\nhis head, as if he felt that it were going to burst, and stops under\r\nthe window.  But since he cannot see out of it he leaves off looking,\r\nand, picking up the lid of one of the tins, peers into it, as if\r\ntrying to make a companion of his own face.  It has grown very nearly\r\ndark.  Suddenly the lid falls out of his hand with a clatter--the\r\nonly sound that has broken the silence--and he stands staring\r\nintently at the wall where the stuff of the shirt is hanging rather\r\nwhite in the darkness--he seems to be seeing somebody or something\r\nthere.  There is a sharp tap and click; the cell light behind the\r\nglass screen has been turned up.  The cell is brightly lighted.\r\nFalder is seen gasping for breath.\r\n\r\nA sound from far away, as of distant, dull beating on thick metal, is\r\nsuddenly audible.  Falder shrinks back, not able to bear this sudden\r\nclamor.  But the sound grows, as though some great tumbril were\r\nrolling towards the cell.  And gradually it seems to hypnotize him.\r\nHe begins creeping inch by inch nearer to the door.  The banging\r\nsound, traveling from cell to cell, draws closer and closer; Falder's\r\nhands are seen moving as if his spirit had already joined in this\r\nbeating, and the sound swells till it seems to have entered the very\r\ncell.  He suddenly raises his clenched fists.  Panting violently, he\r\nflings himself at his door, and beats on it.\"\r\n\r\nFinally Falder leaves the prison, a broken ticket-of-leave man, the\r\nstamp of the convict upon his brow, the iron of misery in his soul.\r\nThanks to Ruth's pleading, the firm of James How and Son is willing\r\nto take Falder back in their employ, on condition that he give up\r\nRuth.  It is then that Falder learns the awful news that the woman he\r\nloves had been driven by the merciless economic Moloch to sell\r\nherself.  She \"tried making skirts ... cheap things....  I never\r\nmade more than ten shillings a week, buying my own cotton, and\r\nworking all day.  I hardly ever got to bed till past twelve....\r\nAnd then ... my employer happened--he's happened ever since.\"  At\r\nthis terrible psychologic moment the police appear to drag him back\r\nto prison for failing to report himself as ticket-of-leave man.\r\nCompletely overwhelmed by the inexorability of his environment, young\r\nFalder seeks and finds peace, greater than human justice, by throwing\r\nhimself down to death, as the detectives are taking him back to\r\nprison.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible to estimate the effect produced by this play.\r\nPerhaps some conception can be gained from the very unusual\r\ncircumstance that it had proved so powerful as to induce the Home\r\nSecretary of Great Britain to undertake extensive prison reforms in\r\nEngland.  A very encouraging sign this, of the influence exerted by\r\nthe modern drama.  It is to be hoped that the thundering indictment\r\nof Mr. Galsworthy will not remain without similar effect upon the\r\npublic sentiment and prison conditions of America.  At any rate, it\r\nis certain that no other modern play has borne such direct and\r\nimmediate fruit in wakening the social conscience.\r\n\r\nAnother modern play, THE SERVANT IN THE HOUSE, strikes a vital key\r\nin our social life.  The hero of Mr. Kennedy's masterpiece is Robert,\r\na coarse, filthy drunkard, whom respectable society has repudiated.\r\nRobert, the sewer cleaner, is the real hero of the play; nay, its\r\ntrue and only savior.  It is he who volunteers to go down into the\r\ndangerous sewer, so that his comrades \"can 'ave light and air.\"\r\nAfter all, has he not sacrificed his life always, so that others may\r\nhave light and air?\r\n\r\nThe thought that labor is the redeemer of social well-being has been\r\ncried from the housetops in every tongue and every clime.  Yet the\r\nsimple words of Robert express the significance of labor and its\r\nmission with far greater potency.\r\n\r\nAmerica is still in its dramatic infancy.  Most of the attempts along\r\nthis line to mirror life, have been wretched failures.  Still, there\r\nare hopeful signs in the attitude of the intelligent public toward\r\nmodern plays, even if they be from foreign soil.\r\n\r\nThe only real drama America has so far produced is THE EASIEST WAY,\r\nby Eugene Walter.\r\n\r\nIt is supposed to represent a \"peculiar phase\" of New York life.  If\r\nthat were all, it would be of minor significance.  That which gives\r\nthe play its real importance and value lies much deeper.  It lies,\r\nfirst, in the fundamental current of our social fabric which drives\r\nus all, even stronger characters than Laura, into the easiest way--a\r\nway so very destructive of integrity, truth, and justice.  Secondly,\r\nthe cruel, senseless fatalism conditioned in Laura's sex.  These two\r\nfeatures put the universal stamp upon the play, and characterize it\r\nas one of the strongest dramatic indictments against society.\r\n\r\nThe criminal waste of human energy, in economic and social\r\nconditions, drives Laura as it drives the average girl to marry any\r\nman for a \"home\"; or as it drives men to endure the worst indignities\r\nfor a miserable pittance.\r\n\r\nThen there is that other respectable institution, the fatalism of\r\nLaura's sex.  The inevitability of that force is summed up in the\r\nfollowing words: \"Don't you know that we count no more in the life of\r\nthese men than tamed animals?  It's a game, and if we don't play our\r\ncards well, we lose.\"  Woman in the battle with life has but one\r\nweapon, one commodity--sex.  That alone serves as a trump card in the\r\ngame of life.\r\n\r\nThis blind fatalism has made of woman a parasite, an inert thing.\r\nWhy then expect perseverance or energy of Laura?  The easiest way is\r\nthe path mapped out for her from time immemorial.  She could follow\r\nno other.\r\n\r\nA number of other plays could be quoted as characteristic of the\r\ngrowing role of the drama as a disseminator of radical thought.\r\nSuffice to mention THE THIRD DEGREE, by Charles Klein; THE FOURTH\r\nESTATE, by Medill Patterson; A MAN'S WORLD, by Ida Croutchers,--all\r\npointing to the dawn of dramatic art in America, an art which is\r\ndiscovering to the people the terrible diseases of our social body.\r\n\r\nIt has been said of old, all roads lead to Rome.  In paraphrased\r\napplication to the tendencies of our day, it may truly be said that\r\nall roads lead to the great social reconstruction.  The economic\r\nawakening of the workingman, and his realization of the necessity for\r\nconcerted industrial action; the tendencies of modern education,\r\nespecially in their application to the free development of the child;\r\nthe spirit of growing unrest expressed through, and cultivated by,\r\nart and literature, all pave the way to the Open Road.  Above all,\r\nthe modern drama, operating through the double channel of dramatist\r\nand interpreter, affecting as it does both mind and heart, is the\r\nstrongest force in developing social discontent, swelling the\r\npowerful tide of unrest that sweeps onward and over the dam of\r\nignorance, prejudice, and superstition.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] HONOR.\r\n\r\n[2] MAGDA.\r\n\r\n[3] BEFORE SUNRISE.\r\n\r\n[4] THE WEAVERS.\r\n\r\n[5] THE SUNKEN BELL.\r\n\r\n[6] YOUTH.\r\n\r\n[7] THE AWAKENING OF SPRING.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Anarchism and Other Essays, by Emma Goldman",
