The additions to this volume are even more\r\nnumerous than those to the first, with the consequence that, in spite of\r\nthe typographical devices explained in the preface to the second edition\r\nof the first volume, the text of this volume has been increased by one\r\nhundred pages. The increase is, in some measure, due to the fact that\r\nthe thirteen Conventions of the Second Hague Peace Conference, and,\r\nfurther, the Declaration of London, are fully discussed and expounded.\r\nBut the increase is also due to the fact that a number of other new\r\ntopics have been discussed; I will only mention the questions whether\r\nenemy subjects have _persona standi in judicio_ (§ 100_a_), and whether\r\ntrading with enemy subjects is permitted (§ 101).\r\n\r\nThe system of the work, with but occasional slight alterations in\r\narrangement and the headings of the sections, remains the same. In those\r\ncases, however, in which a portion had to be entirely rewritten--as, for\r\ninstance, that on Enemy Character, that on Commencement of War, and that\r\non Unneutral Service--the arrangement of the topics differs from that in\r\nthe first edition, and the headings of the sections also differ. Apart\r\nfrom many new sections, a whole chapter treating of the proposed\r\nInternational Prize Court has been added at the end of the volume.\r\n\r\nSince some of the Conventions produced by the Second Peace Conference,\r\nand, further, the Declaration of London, have not yet been ratified, the\r\ntask of the writer of a comprehensive treatise on International Law is\r\nvery difficult: he must certainly not treat the rules in these\r\nunratified documents as law, but, on the other hand, he must not ignore\r\nthem. For this reason the right method seemed to be to give everywhere\r\nthe law hitherto prevailing, and to give also the changes in the law\r\nwhich are proposed by these unratified documents. I venture to hope that\r\nthis method will enable the reader to form a judgment of his own with\r\nregard to the merits of the Declaration of London. I have not concealed\r\nmy conviction that the ratification of this Declaration would mark great\r\nprogress in the development of International Law, since it offers a\r\ncommon agreement upon a number of subjects concerning which there has\r\nbeen hitherto much discord both in theory and practice. But I have\r\nendeavoured to put the matter impartially before the reader, and I have\r\ntaken special care to draw attention to very numerous points which have\r\nnot been settled by the Declaration of London.\r\n\r\nIn revising and rewriting this volume I have remained true to the\r\nprinciple of impartiality, neither taking the part of any one nation,\r\nnor denouncing any other. The discredit which International Law\r\nconcerning War and Neutrality suffers in the minds of certain sections\r\nof the public is largely due to the fact that many writers have not in\r\nthe past approached the subject with that impartial and truly\r\ninternational spirit which is indispensable for its proper treatment.\r\n\r\nMany friends of the book have asked that the second edition might, in\r\nthe Appendix, offer an English translation of the French texts\r\nconcerned. I was prepared to accede to their request, but had to abstain\r\nfrom doing so on account of the fact that the addition of a translation\r\nwould have made the volume too bulky for convenience; the new\r\nConventions of the Second Hague Peace Conference, the Declaration of\r\nLondon together with the Report of the Drafting Committee of the Naval\r\nConference of London, the Naval Prize Bill of 1911, and the Geneva\r\nConvention Act of 1911, all of which necessarily had to be added, having\r\nincreased the Appendix very considerably.\r\n\r\nIt has been the aim of my assistants and myself to make the quotations\r\nin this and the preceding volume as correct as possible. However,\r\nconsidering that there are many thousands of citations, it would be a\r\nmiracle if there were not numerous mistakes and misprints in them, in\r\nspite of the great care which has been bestowed upon the matter. I shall\r\nbe most grateful, therefore, if readers will kindly draw my attention to\r\nany inaccuracy they may notice.\r\n\r\nMy thanks are once more due to reviewers and readers who have drawn my\r\nattention to mistakes and misprints in the first edition; and I am again\r\nindebted to Miss B. M. Rutter and Mr. C. F. Pond for their valuable\r\nassistance in reading the proofs and in drawing up the Table of Cases\r\nand the alphabetical Index.\r\n\r\n    L.

International differences can arise from a variety of grounds.\r\nBetween the extremes of a simple and comparatively unimportant act of\r\ndiscourtesy committed by one State against another, on the one hand,\r\nand, on the other, so gross an insult as must necessarily lead to war,\r\nthere are many other grounds varying in nature and importance. State\r\ndifferences are correctly divided into legal and political. Legal\r\ndifferences arise from acts for which States have to bear\r\nresponsibility, be it acts of their own or of their Parliaments,\r\njudicial and administrative officials, armed forces, or individuals\r\nliving on their territory.[1] Political differences are the result of a\r\nconflict of political interests. But although this distinction is\r\ncertainly theoretically correct and of practical importance, frequently\r\nin practice a sharp line cannot be drawn. For in many cases States\r\neither hide their political interests behind a claim for an alleged\r\ninjury, or make a positive, but comparatively insignificant, injury a\r\npretext for the carrying out of political ends. Nations which have been\r\nfor years facing each other armed to the teeth, waiting for a convenient\r\nmoment to engage in hostilities, are only too ready to obliterate the\r\nboundary line between legal and political differences. Between such\r\nnations a condition of continuous friction prevails which makes it\r\ndifficult, if not impossible, in every case which arises to distinguish\r\nthe legal from the political character of the difference.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See above, vol. I. § 149.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: International Law not exclusively concerned with Legal\r\nDifferences.]\r\n\r\n§ 2. It is often maintained that the Law of Nations is concerned with\r\nlegal differences only, political differences being a matter not of law\r\nbut of politics. Now it is certainly true that only legal differences\r\ncan be settled by a juristic decision of the underlying juristic\r\nquestion, whatever may be the way in which such decision is arrived at.\r\nBut although political differences cannot be the objects of juristic\r\ndecision, they can be settled short of war by amicable or compulsive\r\nmeans. And legal differences, although within the scope of juristic\r\ndecision, can be of such kinds as to prevent the parties from submitting\r\nthem to such decision, without being of a nature that they cannot be\r\nsettled peaceably at all. Moreover, although the distinction between\r\nlegal and political differences is certainly correct in theory and of\r\nimportance in practice, nevertheless, in practice, a sharp line\r\nfrequently cannot be drawn, as has just been pointed out. Therefore the\r\nLaw of Nations is not exclusively concerned with legal differences, for\r\nin fact all amicable means of settling legal differences are likewise\r\nmeans of settling political differences, and so are two of the\r\ncompulsive means of settling differences--namely, pacific blockade and\r\nintervention.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Amicable in contradistinction to compulsive settlement of\r\nDifferences.]\r\n\r\n§ 3. Political and legal differences can be settled either by amicable\r\nor by compulsive means. There are four kinds of amicable means--namely,\r\nnegotiation between the parties, good offices of third parties,\r\nmediation, and arbitration.[2] And there are also four kinds of\r\ncompulsive means--namely, retorsion, reprisals (including embargo),\r\nblockade, and intervention of third States. No State is allowed to make\r\nuse of compulsive means before negotiation has been tried, but there is\r\nno necessity for the good offices or mediation of third States, and\r\neventually arbitration,[3] to be tried beforehand also. Frequently,\r\nhowever, States nowadays make use of the so-called Compromise Clause[4]\r\nin their treaties, stipulating thereby that any differences arising\r\nbetween the contracting parties with regard to matters regulated by, or\r\nto the interpretation of, the respective treaties shall be settled\r\nthrough the amicable means of arbitration to the exclusion of all\r\ncompulsive means. And there are even a few examples of States which have\r\nconcluded treaties stipulating that all differences, without exception,\r\nthat might arise between them should be amicably settled by\r\narbitration.[5] These exceptions, however, only confirm the rule that no\r\ninternational legal duty exists for States to settle their differences\r\namicably through arbitration, or even to try to settle them in this way,\r\nbefore they make use of compulsive means.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Some writers (see Hall, § 118, and Heilborn, _System_, p.\r\n404) refuse to treat negotiation, good offices, and mediation as means\r\nof settling differences, because they cannot find that these means are\r\nof any legal value, it being in the choice of the parties whether or not\r\nthey agree to make use of them. They forget, however, the enormous\r\npolitical value of these means, which alone well justifies their\r\ntreatment; moreover, there are already some positive legal rules in\r\nexistence concerning these means--see Hague Arbitration Treaty, articles\r\n2-7 and 9-36--and others will in time, no doubt, be established.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Except in the case of contract debts claimed from the\r\nGovernment of one country by the Government of another country as being\r\ndue to its nationals.

The simplest means of settling State differences, and that to which\r\nStates always resort before they make use of other means, is\r\nnegotiation. It consists in such acts of intercourse between the parties\r\nas are initiated and directed for the purpose of effecting an\r\nunderstanding and thereby amicably settling the difference that has\r\narisen between them.[6] Negotiation as a rule begins by a State\r\ncomplaining of a certain act, or lodging a certain claim with another\r\nState. The next step is a statement from the latter making out its case,\r\nwhich is handed over to the former. It may be that the parties come at\r\nonce to an understanding through this simple exchange of statements. If\r\nnot, other acts may follow according to the requirements of the special\r\ncase. Thus, for instance, other statements may be exchanged, or a\r\nconference of diplomatic envoys, or even of the heads of the States at\r\nvariance, may be arranged for the purpose of discussing the differences\r\nand preparing the basis for an understanding.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: See above, vol. I. §§ 477-482, where the international\r\ntransaction of negotiation in general is discussed.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: International Commissions of Inquiry.]\r\n\r\n§ 5. The contracting Powers of the Hague Convention for the peaceful\r\nsettlement of international differences deem it expedient and desirable\r\nthat, if the ordinary diplomatic negotiation has failed to settle such\r\ndifferences as do not involve either honour or vital interests, the\r\nparties should, so far as circumstances allow, institute an\r\nInternational Commission of Inquiry[7] for the purpose of elucidating\r\nthe facts underlying the difference by an impartial and conscientious\r\ninvestigation. The Convention of 1899 had only six articles (9-14) on\r\nthe subject. The Second Conference of 1907, profiting by the experience\r\ngained by the Commission of Inquiry in the Dogger Bank[8] case, the\r\nfirst and as yet only occasion on which a Commission of Inquiry was\r\ninstituted, remodelled the institution, and Convention I. treats of the\r\nsubject in twenty-eight articles (9-36). The more important stipulations\r\nare the following:--\r\n\r\n(1) The Commissions are to be constituted by a special treaty of the\r\nparties, which is to determine the facts to be examined, the manner and\r\nperiod within which the Commission is to be formed, the extent of the\r\npowers of the Commissioners, the place where the Commission is to meet\r\nand whether it may remove to another place, the languages to be used by\r\nthe Commission and parties, and the like (articles 9-10). If the treaty\r\ndoes not determine the place where the Commission is to sit, it shall\r\nsit at the Hague; if the treaty does not specify the languages to be\r\nused, the question shall be decided by the Commission; and if the treaty\r\ndoes not stipulate the manner in which the Commission is to be formed,\r\nit shall be formed in the manner determined by articles 45 and 57 of\r\nConvention I. (articles 11-12). The parties may appoint Assessors,\r\nAgents, and Counsel (articles 10, 13, 14).\r\n\r\n(2) The International Bureau of the Permanent Court of Arbitration acts\r\nas Registry for the Commissions which sit at the Hague; but if they sit\r\nelsewhere, a Secretary-General is to be appointed whose office serves as\r\nRegistry (articles 15-16).\r\n\r\n(3) The parties may agree upon the rules of procedure to be followed by\r\nthe Commission, but if they do not provide such rules themselves, the\r\nrules of procedure, comprised in articles 19-32 are applicable (article\r\n17), and, in any case, the Commission is to settle such details of the\r\nprocedure as are either not covered by the treaty of the parties or by\r\narticles 19-32, and is to arrange all the formalities required for\r\ndealing with the evidence (article 18).\r\n\r\n(4) The Report of the Commission is to be signed by all its members; but\r\nif a member refuses to sign, the fact is to be mentioned, and the\r\nvalidity of the Report is not thereby affected (article 33). The Report\r\nof the Commission is read in open Court, the Agents and Counsel of the\r\nparties being present or duly summoned to attend; a copy of the Report\r\nis furnished to each party (article 34). This Report is absolutely\r\nlimited to a statement of the facts, it has in no way the character of\r\nan Arbitral Award, and it leaves to the parties entire freedom as to the\r\neffect to be given to the statement of the facts (article 35).\r\n\r\n(5) Each party pays its own expenses and an equal share of the expenses\r\nof the Commission (article 36).\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: See Herr, _Die Untersuchungskommissionen der Haager\r\nFriedenskonferenzen_ (1911); Meurer, I. pp. 129-165; Higgins, pp.\r\n167-170; Lémonon, pp. 77-91: Wehberg, _Kommentar_, pp. 21-46; Nippold,\r\nI. pp. 23-35; Scott, _Conferences_, pp. 265-273; Politis in _R.G._ XIX.\r\n(1912), pp. 149-188.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: On October 24, 1904, during the Russo-Japanese war, the\r\nRussian Baltic fleet, which was on its way to the Far East, fired into\r\nthe Hull fishing fleet off the Dogger Bank, in the North Sea, whereby\r\ntwo fishermen were killed and considerable damage was done to several\r\ntrawlers. Great Britain demanded from Russia not only an apology and\r\nample damages, but also severe punishment of the officer responsible for\r\nthe outrage. As Russia maintained that the firing was caused by the\r\napproach of some Japanese torpedo-boats, and that she could therefore\r\nnot punish the officer in command, the parties agreed upon the\r\nestablishment of an International Commission of Inquiry, which, however,\r\nwas charged not only to ascertain the facts of the incident but also to\r\npronounce an opinion concerning the responsibility for the incident and\r\nthe degree of blame attaching to the responsible persons. The Commission\r\nconsisted of five naval officers of high rank--namely, one British, one\r\nRussian, one American, one French, and one Austrian, who sat at Paris in\r\nFebruary 1905. The report of the Commission states that no torpedo-boats\r\nhad been present, that the opening of fire on the part of the Baltic\r\nfleet was not justifiable, that Admiral Rojdestvensky, the commander of\r\nthe Baltic fleet, was responsible for the incident, but that these facts\r\nwere \"not of a nature to cast any discredit upon the military qualities\r\nor the humanity of Admiral Rojdestvensky or of the _personnel_ of his\r\nsquadron.\" In consequence of the last part of this report Great Britain\r\ncould not insist upon any punishment to be meted out to the responsible\r\nRussian Admiral, but Russia paid a sum of £65,000 to indemnify the\r\nvictims of the incident and the families of the two dead fishermen.

The effect of negotiation can be to make it apparent that the\r\nparties cannot come to an amicable understanding at all. But frequently\r\nthe effect is that one of the parties acknowledges the claim of the\r\nother party. Again, sometimes negotiation results in a party, although\r\nit does not acknowledge the opponent's alleged rights, waiving its own\r\nrights for the sake of peace and for the purpose of making friends with\r\nthe opponent. And, lastly, the effect of negotiation can be a compromise\r\nbetween the parties. Frequently the parties, after having come to an\r\nunderstanding, conclude a treaty in which they embody the terms of the\r\nunderstanding arrived at through negotiation. The practice of everyday\r\nlife shows clearly the great importance of negotiation as a means of\r\nsettling international differences. The modern development of\r\ninternational traffic and transport, the fact that individuals are\r\nconstantly travelling on foreign territories, the keen interest taken by\r\nall powerful States in colonial enterprise, and many other factors, make\r\nthe daily rise of differences between States unavoidable. Yet the\r\ngreater number of such differences are settled through negotiation of\r\nsome kind or other.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nGOOD OFFICES AND MEDIATION\r\n\r\n  Maine, pp. 207-228--Phillimore, III. §§ 3-5--Twiss, II. §\r\n  7--Lawrence, § 220--Moore, VII. §§ 1065-1068--Taylor, §§\r\n  359-360--Wheaton, § 73--Bluntschli, §§ 483-487--Heffter, §§\r\n  107-108--Bulmerincq in Holtzendorff, IV. pp. 17-30--Ullmann, §§\r\n  152-153--Bonfils, Nos. 932'1-943'1--Despagnet, Nos.\r\n  471-476--Pradier-Fodéré, VI.

When parties are not inclined to settle their differences by\r\nnegotiation, or when they have negotiated without effecting an\r\nunderstanding, a third State can procure a settlement through its good\r\noffices or its mediation, whether only one or both parties have asked\r\nfor the help of the third State or the latter has spontaneously offered\r\nit. There is also possible a collective mediation, several States acting\r\nat the same time as mediators. It is further possible for a mediatorial\r\nConference or Congress to meet for the purpose of discussing the terms\r\nof an understanding between the conflicting parties. And it must be\r\nespecially mentioned that good offices and mediation are not confined to\r\nthe time before the differing parties have appealed to arms; they can\r\nalso be offered and sought during hostilities for the purpose of\r\nbringing the war to an end. It is during war in particular that good\r\noffices and mediation are of great value, neither of the belligerents as\r\na rule being inclined to open peace negotiations on his own account.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Right and duty of offering, requesting, and rendering Good\r\nOffices and Mediation.]\r\n\r\n§ 8. As a rule, no duty exists for a third State to offer its good\r\noffices or mediation, or to respond to a request of the conflicting\r\nStates for such, nor is it, as a rule, the duty of the conflicting\r\nparties themselves to ask or to accept a third State's good offices and\r\nmediation. But by special treaty such duty can be stipulated. Thus, for\r\ninstance, by article 8 of the Peace Treaty of Paris of March 30, 1856,\r\nbetween Austria, France, Great Britain, Prussia, Russia, Sardinia, and\r\nTurkey, it was stipulated that, in case in the future such difference as\r\nthreatened peace should arise between Turkey and one or more of the\r\nsignatory Powers, the parties should be obliged,[9] before resorting to\r\narms, to ask for the mediation of the other signatory Powers. Thus,\r\nfurther, article 12 of the General Act of the Berlin Congo Conference of\r\n1885 stipulates that, in case a serious difference should arise between\r\nsome of the signatory Powers as regards the Congo territories, the\r\nparties should, before resorting to arms, be obliged to ask the other\r\nsignatory Powers for their mediation. And lately the Hague Conventions\r\nfor the peaceful settlement of international differences have laid down\r\nsome stipulations respecting the right and duty of good offices and\r\nmediation, which will be found below in § 10.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: But Italy did not comply with this stipulation before she\r\ndeclared war against Turkey in September 1911.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Good Offices in contradistinction to Mediation.]\r\n\r\n§ 9. Diplomatic practice frequently does not distinguish between good\r\noffices and mediation. But although good offices can easily develop into\r\nmediation, they must not be confounded with it. The difference between\r\nthem is that, whereas good offices consist in various kinds of action\r\ntending to call negotiations between the conflicting States into\r\nexistence, mediation consists in a direct conduct of negotiations\r\nbetween the differing parties on the basis of proposals made by the\r\nmediator. Good offices seek to induce the conflicting parties, who are\r\neither not at all inclined to negotiate with each other or who have\r\nnegotiated without effecting an understanding, to enter or to re-enter\r\ninto such negotiations. Good offices can also consist in advice, in\r\nsubmitting a proposal of one of the parties to the other, and the like,\r\nbut they never take part in the negotiations themselves. On the other\r\nhand, the mediator is the middleman who does take part in the\r\nnegotiations. He makes certain propositions on the basis of which the\r\nStates at variance may come to an understanding. He even conducts the\r\nnegotiations himself, always anxious to reconcile the opposing claims\r\nand to appease the feeling of resentment between the parties. All the\r\nefforts of the mediator may often, of course, be useless, the differing\r\nparties being unable or unwilling to consent to an agreement. But if an\r\nunderstanding is arrived at, the position of the mediator as a party to\r\nthe negotiation, although not a participator in the difference,\r\nfrequently becomes clearly apparent either by the drafting of a special\r\nact of mediation which is signed by the States at variance and the\r\nmediator, or by the fact that in the convention between the conflicting\r\nStates, which stipulates the terms of their understanding, the mediator\r\nis mentioned.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Good Offices and Mediation according to the Hague Arbitration\r\nConvention.]\r\n\r\n§ 10. The Hague Convention for the peaceful settlement of international\r\ndifferences[10] undertakes in articles 2-8 the task of making the\r\nsignatory Powers have recourse more frequently than hitherto to good\r\noffices and mediation; it likewise recommends a new and particular form\r\nof mediation. Its rules are the following:--\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: See Meurer, I. pp. 104-128; Higgins, p. 167; Barclay,\r\n_Problems_, pp. 191-197; Lémonon, pp. 69-73; Wehberg, _Kommentar_, pp.\r\n10-21; Nippold, I. pp. 21-22; Scott, _Conferences_, pp. 256-265.]\r\n\r\n(1) The contracting Powers agree to have recourse, before they appeal to\r\narms, as far as circumstances allow, to good offices or mediation\r\n(article 2). And independently of this recourse, they consider it\r\nexpedient and desirable that contracting Powers who are strangers to\r\nthe dispute should, on their own initiative, offer their good offices or\r\nmediation (article 3). A real legal duty to offer good offices or\r\nmediation is not thereby created; only the expediency and desirability\r\nof such offer are recognised. In regard to the legal duty of conflicting\r\nStates to ask for good offices or mediation, it is obvious that,\r\nalthough literally such duty is agreed upon, the condition \"as far as\r\ncircumstances allow\" makes it more or less illusory, as it is in the\r\ndiscretion of the parties to judge for themselves whether or not the\r\ncircumstances of the special case allow their having recourse to good\r\noffices and mediation.\r\n\r\n(2) The contracting Powers agree that (article 3) a right to offer good\r\noffices or mediation exists for those of them who are strangers to a\r\ndispute, and that this right exists also after the conflicting parties\r\nhave appealed to arms. Consequently, every contracting Power, when at\r\nvariance with another, be it before or after the outbreak of\r\nhostilities, is in duty bound to receive an offer made for good offices\r\nor mediation, although it need not accept such offer. And it is\r\nespecially stipulated that the exercise of the right to offer good\r\noffices or mediation may never be regarded by the conflicting States as\r\nan unfriendly act (article 3). It is, further, stipulated that the\r\ncontracting Powers consider it their duty in a serious conflict to\r\nremind the parties of the Permanent Court of Arbitration, and that the\r\nadvice to have recourse to this Court may only be considered as an\r\nexercise of good offices (article 48, paragraphs 1 and 2). And, finally,\r\nin case of dispute between two Powers, one of them may always address to\r\nthe International Bureau of the Permanent Court of Arbitration a note\r\ncontaining a declaration that it would be ready to submit the dispute to\r\narbitration, whereupon the Bureau must at once inform the other Power of\r\nthis declaration (article 48, paragraphs 3 and 4).\r\n\r\n(3) Mediation is defined (article 4) as reconciliation of the opposing\r\nclaims and appeasement of the feelings of resentment between the\r\nconflicting States, and it is specially emphasised that good offices and\r\nmediation have exclusively the character of advice.\r\n\r\n(4) The acceptance of mediation--and, of course, of good offices, which\r\nis not mentioned--does not (article 7) have the effect of interrupting,\r\ndelaying, or hindering mobilisation or other preparatory measures for\r\nwar, or of interrupting military operations when war has broken out\r\nbefore the acceptance of mediation, unless there should be an agreement\r\nto the contrary.\r\n\r\n(5) The functions of the mediator are at an end (article 5) when once it\r\nis stated, either by one of the conflicting parties or by the mediator\r\nhimself, that the means of reconciliation proposed by him are not\r\naccepted.\r\n\r\n(6) A new and particular form of mediation is recommended by article 8.\r\nBefore appealing to arms the conflicting States choose respectively a\r\nState as umpire, to whom each intrusts the mission of entering into\r\ndirect communication with the umpire chosen by the other side for the\r\npurpose of preventing the rupture of pacific relations. The period of\r\nthe mandate extends, unless otherwise stipulated, to thirty days, and\r\nduring such period the conflicting States cease from all direct\r\ncommunication on the matter in dispute, which is regarded as referred\r\nexclusively to the mediating umpires, who must use their best efforts to\r\nsettle the difference. Should such mediation not succeed in bringing the\r\nconflicting States to an understanding, and should, consequently, a\r\ndefinite rupture of pacific relations take place, the chosen umpires are\r\njointly charged with the task of taking advantage of any opportunity to\r\nrestore peace.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Value of Good Offices and Mediation.]\r\n\r\n§ 11. The value of good offices and mediation for the amicable\r\nsettlement of international conflicts, be it before or after the parties\r\nhave appealed to arms, cannot be over-estimated. Hostilities have been\r\nfrequently prevented through the authority and the skill of mediators,\r\nand furiously raging wars have been brought to an end through good\r\noffices and mediation of third States.[11] Nowadays the importance of\r\nthese means of settlement of international differences is even greater\r\nthan in the past. The outbreak of war is under the circumstances and\r\nconditions of our times no longer a matter of indifference to all except\r\nthe belligerent States, and no State which goes to war knows exactly how\r\nfar such war may affect its very existence. If good offices and\r\nmediation are interposed at the right moment, they will in many cases\r\nnot fail to effect a settlement of the conflict. The stipulations of the\r\nHague Convention for the peaceful adjustment of differences have greatly\r\nenhanced the value of good offices and mediation by giving a legal right\r\nto Powers, strangers to the dispute, to offer their good offices and\r\nmediation before and during hostilities.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: See the important cases of mediation discussed by Calvo,\r\nIII. §§ 1684-1700, and Bonfils, Nos. 936-942. From our own days the case\r\nof the Dogger Bank incident of 1904 may be quoted as an example, for it\r\nwas through the mediation of France that Great Britain and Russia agreed\r\nupon the establishment of an International Commission of Inquiry. (See\r\np. 7, note 2.) And the good offices of the President of the United\r\nStates of America were the means of inducing Russia and Japan, in August\r\n1905, to open the negotiations which actually led to the conclusion of\r\nthe Peace of Portsmouth on September 5, 1905.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nARBITRATION\r\n\r\n  Grotius, II. c. 23, § 8--Vattel, II. § 329--Hall, § 119--Westlake,\r\n  I. pp. 332-356--Lawrence, § 221--Phillimore, III. §§ 3-5--Twiss,\r\n  II. § 5--Taylor, §§ 357-358--Wharton, III. § 316--Moore, VII. §§\r\n  1069-1080--Bluntschli, §§ 488-498--Heffter, § 109--Bulmerincq in\r\n  Holtzendorff, IV. pp. 30-58--Ullmann, §§ 154-156--Bonfils, Nos.\r\n  944-969--Despagnet, Nos. 722-741--Pradier-Fodéré, VI.

Arbitration is the name for the determination of differences\r\nbetween States through the verdict of one or more umpires chosen by the\r\nparties. As there is no central political authority above the Sovereign\r\nStates, and no such International Court as could exercise jurisdiction\r\nover them, State differences, unlike differences between private\r\nindividuals, cannot as a rule be obligatorily settled in courts of\r\njustice. The only way in which a settlement of State differences through\r\na verdict may be arrived at is by the conflicting States voluntarily\r\nconsenting to submit themselves to a verdict of one or more umpires\r\nchosen by themselves for that purpose.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Treaty of Arbitration.]\r\n\r\n§ 13. It is, therefore, necessary for such conflicting States as intend\r\nto have the conflict determined by arbitration to conclude a treaty by\r\nwhich they agree to this course. Such treaty of arbitration involves the\r\nobligation of both parties to submit in good faith to the decision of\r\nthe arbitrators. Frequently a treaty of arbitration will be concluded\r\nafter the outbreak of a difference, but it also frequently happens that\r\nStates concluding treaties stipulate therein by the so-called Compromise\r\nClause,[12] that any difference arising between the parties respecting\r\nmatters regulated by such treaty shall be determined by arbitration. Two\r\nor more States can also conclude a so-called general treaty of\r\narbitration, or treaty of permanent arbitration, stipulating that all or\r\ncertain kinds of differences in future arising between them shall be\r\nsettled by this method. Thus article 7 of the Commercial Treaty between\r\nHolland and Portugal[13] of July 5, 1894, contains such a general treaty\r\nof arbitration, as it stipulates arbitration not only for differences\r\nrespecting matters of commerce, but for all kinds of differences arising\r\nin the future between the parties, provided these differences do not\r\nconcern their independence or autonomy. Until the Hague Peace Conference\r\nof 1899, however, general treaties of arbitration were not numerous. But\r\npublic opinion everywhere was aroused in favour of general arbitration\r\ntreaties through the success of this conference, with the result that\r\nfrom 1900 to the present day many general arbitration treaties have been\r\nconcluded.[14]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: See above, § 3.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: See Martens, _N.R.G._ 2nd Ser. XXII. p. 590.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: See below, § 17.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Who is to arbitrate?]\r\n\r\n§ 14. States which conclude an arbitration treaty have to agree upon the\r\narbitrators. If they choose a third State as arbitrator, they have to\r\nconclude a treaty (_receptum arbitri_) with such State, by which they\r\nappoint the chosen State and by which such State accepts the\r\nappointment. The appointed State chooses on its own behalf those umpires\r\nwho actually serve as arbitrators. It can happen that the conflicting\r\nStates choose a head of a third State as arbitrator. But such head never\r\nhimself investigates the matter; he chooses one or more individuals,\r\nwho make a report and propose a verdict, which he pronounces. And,\r\nfurther, the conflicting States may agree to entrust the arbitration to\r\nany other individual or to a body of individuals, a so-called\r\nArbitration Committee or Commission. Thus the arbitration of 1900 in\r\nregard to the Venezuelan Boundary Dispute between Great Britain,\r\nVenezuela, and the United States was conducted by a Commission, sitting\r\nat Paris, consisting of American and English members and the Russian\r\nProfessor von Martens as President. And the Alaska Boundary Dispute\r\nbetween Great Britain and the United States was settled in 1903, through\r\nthe award of a Commission, sitting at London, consisting of American and\r\nCanadian members, with Lord Alverstone, Lord Chief Justice of England,\r\nas President.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: On what principles Arbitrators proceed and decide.]\r\n\r\n§ 15. The treaty of arbitration must stipulate the principles according\r\nto which the arbitrators have to give their verdict. These principles\r\nmay be the general rules of International Law, but they may also be the\r\nrules of any Municipal Law chosen by the conflicting States, or rules of\r\nnatural equity, or rules specially stipulated in the treaty of\r\narbitration for the special case.[15] And it can also happen that the\r\ntreaty of arbitration stipulates that the arbitrators shall compromise\r\nthe conflicting claims of the parties without resorting to special rules\r\nof law. The treaty of arbitration, further, as a rule, stipulates the\r\nprocedure to be followed by the arbitrators who are investigating and\r\ndetermining the difference. If a treaty of arbitration does not lay down\r\nrules of procedure, the arbitrators themselves have to work out such\r\nrules and to communicate them to the parties.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: See below, § 335, concerning the \"Three rules of\r\nWashington.\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Binding force of Arbitral Verdict.]\r\n\r\n§ 16. An arbitral verdict is final if the arbitration treaty does not\r\nstipulate the contrary, and the verdict given by the arbitrators is\r\nbinding upon the parties. As, however, no such central authority exists\r\nabove the States as could execute the verdict against a State refusing\r\nto submit, it is in such a case the right of the other party to enforce\r\nthe arbitral decision by compulsion. Yet it is obvious that an arbitral\r\nverdict is binding only under the condition[16] that the arbitrators\r\nhave in every way fulfilled their duty as umpires and have been able to\r\nfind their verdict in perfect independence. Should they have been bribed\r\nor not followed their instructions, should their verdict have been given\r\nunder the influence of coercion of any kind, or should one of the\r\nparties have intentionally and maliciously led the arbitrators into an\r\nessential material error, the arbitral verdict would have no binding\r\nforce whatever. Thus the award given in 1831 by the King of Holland in\r\nthe North-Eastern Boundary Dispute between Great Britain and the United\r\nStates of America was not considered binding by the parties because the\r\narbitrator had transgressed his powers.[17] For the same reason, Bolivia\r\nrefused in 1910 to submit to the award of the President of Argentina in\r\nher boundary dispute with Peru.[18] And in October 1910, the Permanent\r\nCourt of Arbitration at the Hague, deciding the case of the United\r\nStates of America against the United States of Venezuela concerning the\r\nclaims of the Orinoco Steamship Company, annulled,[19] with regard to\r\ncertain points, a previous arbitration award given by Mr. Barge.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: See Donker Curtius and Nys in _R.I._ 2nd Ser. XII. (1910),\r\npp. 5-34 and 595-641.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: See Moore, VII. § 1082, and Moore, _Arbitrations_, I. pp.\r\n81-161.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: See Fiore in _R.G._ XVII. (1910), pp. 225-256.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: See Martens, _N.R.G._ 3rd Ser. IV. (1911), p. 79.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: What differences can be decided by Arbitration.]\r\n\r\n§ 17. It is often maintained that every possible difference between\r\nStates could not be determined by arbitration, and, consequently,\r\nefforts are made to distinguish those groups of State differences which\r\nare determinable by arbitration from others. Now although all States may\r\nnever consent to have all possible differences decided by arbitration,\r\ntheoretically there is no reason for a distinction between differences\r\ndecidable and undecidable through arbitration. For there can be no doubt\r\nthat, the consent of the parties once given, every possible difference\r\nmight be settled through arbitration, either by the verdict being based\r\non rules of International Law, or rules of natural equity, or by\r\nopposing claims being compromised. But, differing from the theoretical\r\nquestion as to what differences are and are not determinable by\r\narbitration, is the question as to what kind of State differences\r\n_ought_ always to be settled in this manner. The latter question has\r\nbeen answered by article 38 (formerly 16) of the Hague Convention for\r\nthe peaceful adjustment of international differences, the contracting\r\nPowers therein recognising arbitration as the most efficacious, and at\r\nthe same time the most equitable, means of determining differences of a\r\njudicial character in general, and in especial differences regarding the\r\ninterpretation or application of international treaties. But future\r\nexperience must decide whether the signatory Powers will in practice\r\nalways act according to this distinction.\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, when, in 1903, Great Britain and France, following\r\nthe suggestion of this article 38 (formerly 16), concluded a treaty in\r\nwhich they agreed to settle by arbitration all such differences of a\r\nlegal nature as do not affect their vital interests, their independence,\r\nor their honour, many other States followed the lead. Great Britain, in\r\nthe same and the following years, entered into such arbitration treaties\r\nwith Spain, Italy, Germany, Sweden, Norway, Portugal, Switzerland,\r\nAustria-Hungary, Holland, Denmark, the United States of America,\r\nColombia, and Brazil. All these agreements were concluded for five\r\nyears only, but those which have since expired have all been renewed for\r\nanother period of five years.\r\n\r\nYet there is a flaw in all these treaties, because the decision as to\r\nwhether a difference is of a legal nature or not, is left to the\r\ndiscretion of the parties. Cases have happened in which one of the\r\nparties has claimed to have a difference settled by arbitration on\r\naccount of its legal nature, whereas the other party has denied the\r\nlegal nature of the difference and, therefore, refused to go to\r\narbitration. For this reason the arbitration treaties signed on August\r\n3, 1911, between the United States of America and Great Britain and\r\nbetween the United States of America and France are epoch making, since\r\narticle 3 provides that, in cases where the parties disagree as to\r\nwhether or not a difference is subject to arbitration under the treaty\r\nconcerned, the question shall be submitted to a joint High Commission of\r\nInquiry; and that, if all, or all but one, of the members of such\r\nCommission decide the question in the affirmative, the case shall be\r\nsettled by arbitration. Article 3 has, however, been struck out by the\r\nAmerican Senate, with the consequence that these treaties have lost\r\ntheir intrinsic value, even should they be ratified.\r\n\r\nIt should be mentioned that, whereas most arbitration treaties limit\r\narbitration in one or more ways, exempting cases which concern the\r\nindependence, the honour, or the vital interests of the parties,\r\nArgentina[20] and Chili in 1902, Denmark and Holland in 1903, Denmark\r\nand Holland in 1905, Denmark and Portugal in 1907, Argentina and Italy\r\nin 1907, the Central American Republics of Costa Rica, Guatemala,\r\nHonduras, Nicaragua, and San Salvador in 1907, Italy and Holland in\r\n1907 entered into general arbitration treaties according to which all\r\ndifferences without any exception shall be settled by arbitration.[21]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: Earlier than this, on July 23, 1898--see Martens, _N.R.G._\r\n2nd Ser.

(1905), p. 404--Argentina and Paraguay\r\nhad concluded treaties according to which all differences without\r\nexception shall be settled by arbitration.

There can be no doubt that arbitration is, and every day becomes\r\nmore and more, of great importance. History proves that in antiquity and\r\nduring the Middle Ages arbitration was occasionally[22] made use of as a\r\npeaceable means of settling international differences. But, although an\r\nInternational Law made its appearance in modern times, during the\r\nsixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries very few cases of\r\narbitration occurred. It was not until the end of the eighteenth century\r\nthat arbitration was frequently made use of. There are 177 cases from\r\n1794 to the end of 1900.[23] This number shows that the inclination of\r\nStates to agree to arbitration has increased, and there can be no doubt\r\nthat arbitration has a great future. States and the public opinion of\r\nthe whole world become more and more convinced that there are a good\r\nmany international differences which may well be determined by\r\narbitration without any danger whatever to the national existence,\r\nindependence, dignity, and prosperity of the States concerned. A net of\r\nso-called Peace Societies has spread over the whole world, and their\r\nmembers unceasingly work for the promotion of arbitration. The\r\nParliaments of several countries have repeatedly given their vote in\r\nfavour of arbitration; and the Hague Peace Conference of 1899 created a\r\nPermanent Court of Arbitration, a step by which a new epoch of the\r\ndevelopment of International Law was inaugurated. It is certain that\r\narbitration will gradually increase its range, although the time is by\r\nno means in sight when all international differences will find their\r\nsettlement by arbitration.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: See examples in Calvo, III. §§ 1707-1712, and in Nys, _Les\r\norigines du droit international_ (1894), pp. 52-61.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: See La Fontaine's _Histoire sommaire et chronologique des\r\narbitrages internationaux_ in _R.I._ 2nd Ser. IV. pp. 349, 558, 623. See\r\nalso Scott, _Conferences_, pp. 188-252.]\r\n\r\nThe novel institution of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at the Hague\r\nstands at present in the cross-fire of impatient pacifists and cynical\r\npessimists. Because a number of wars have been fought since the\r\nestablishment of the Permanent Court, impatient pacifists are in despair\r\nand consider the institution of the Court of Arbitration a failure,\r\nwhereas cynical pessimists triumphantly point to the fact that the\r\nmillennium would seem to be as far distant as ever. The calm observer of\r\nthe facts who possesses insight in the process of historical\r\ndevelopment, has no cause to despair, for, compared with some\r\ngenerations ago, arbitration is an established force which daily gains\r\nmore power and influence. And when once a real International Court[24]\r\nof justice is established side by side with the Permanent Court of\r\nArbitration, the chances of arbitration will be greatly increased.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: See above, vol. I. § 476_b_.]\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nARBITRATION ACCORDING TO THE HAGUE CONVENTION\r\n\r\n  Ullmann, §§ 155-156--Bonfils, Nos. 953'1-955'1--Despagnet, Nos.\r\n  742-746_bis_--Mérignhac, I. pp. 486-539--Holls, _The Peace\r\n  Conference at the Hague_ (1900)--Martens, _La conférence de la\r\n  paix à la Haye_ (1900)--Mérignhac, _La conférence internationale\r\n  de la paix_ (1900)--Fried, _Die zweite Haager Konferenz_\r\n  (1908)--Meurer, I. pp. 299-372--Scott, _Conferences_, pp.\r\n  286-385--Higgins, pp. 164-179--Lémonon, pp. 188-219--Nippold, I.\r\n  pp. 36-231--Wehberg, _Kommentar_, pp. 46-164.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Arbitral Justice in general.]\r\n\r\n§ 19. Of the 97 articles of the Hague Convention for the peaceful\r\nadjustment of international differences, no fewer than 44--namely,\r\narticles 37-90--deal with arbitration in three chapters, headed \"On\r\nArbitral Justice,\" \"On the Permanent Court of Arbitration,\" and \"On\r\nArbitral Procedure.\" The first chapter, articles 37-40, contains rules\r\non arbitral justice in general, which, however, with one exception, are\r\nnot of a legal but of a merely doctrinal character. Thus the definition\r\nin article 37, first paragraph, \"International arbitration has for its\r\nobject the determination of controversies between States by judges of\r\ntheir own choice and upon the basis of respect for law,\" is as doctrinal\r\nas the assertion of article 38: \"In questions of a judicial character,\r\nand especially in questions regarding the interpretation or application\r\nof International Treaties or Conventions, arbitration is recognised by\r\nthe contracting Powers as the most efficacious and at the same time the\r\nmost equitable method of deciding controversies which have not been\r\nsettled by diplomatic methods. Consequently it would be desirable that,\r\nin disputes regarding the above-mentioned questions, the contracting\r\nPowers should, if the case arise, have recourse to arbitration, in so\r\nfar as circumstances permit.\" And the provision of article 39, that an\r\nagreement of arbitration may be made respecting disputes already in\r\nexistence or arising in the future and may relate to every kind of\r\ncontroversy or solely to controversies of a particular character, is as\r\ndoctrinal as the reservation of article 40, which runs: \"Independently\r\nof existing general or special treaties imposing the obligation to have\r\nrecourse to arbitration on the part of any of the contracting Powers,\r\nthese Powers reserve to themselves the right to conclude, either before\r\nthe ratification of the present Convention or afterwards, new general or\r\nspecial agreements with a view to extending obligatory arbitration to\r\nall cases which they consider possible to submit to it.\" The only rule\r\nof legal character is that of article 37 (second paragraph), enacting\r\nthe already existing customary rule of International Law, that \"the\r\nagreement of arbitration implies the obligation to submit in good faith\r\nto the arbitral sentence.\"\r\n\r\nOn the signatory Powers no obligation whatever to submit any difference\r\nto arbitration is imposed. Even differences of a judicial character, and\r\nespecially those regarding the interpretation or application of\r\ntreaties, for the settlement of which the signatory Powers, in article\r\n38, acknowledge arbitration as the most efficacious and at the same time\r\nthe most equitable method, need not necessarily be submitted to\r\narbitration.\r\n\r\nYet the principle of compulsory arbitration for a limited number of\r\ninternational differences was by no means negatived by the Hague Peace\r\nConferences, especially not by the Second Conference.\r\n\r\nThe principle found, firstly, indirect recognition by the Convention\r\nrespecting the Limitation of the Employment of Force for the Recovery of\r\nContract Debts.[25] Since article I of this Convention stipulates that\r\nrecourse to the employment of force for the recovery of contract debts\r\nclaimed from the Government of one country by the Government of another\r\ncountry as being due to its nationals is not allowed unless the debtor\r\nState refuses arbitration, compulsory arbitration has in this instance\r\nbeen victorious.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: See above, vol. I. § 135, p. 192, where the so-called\r\nDrago doctrine is likewise discussed.]\r\n\r\nSecondly, although it was not possible to agree upon some stipulation\r\nembodying compulsory arbitration for a number of differences in\r\nConvention I., the principle itself was fully recognised, and the Final\r\nAct of the Second Peace Conference includes, therefore, the Declaration\r\nthat the Conference \"is unanimous (1) in admitting the principle of\r\ncompulsory arbitration; (2) in declaring that certain disputes, in\r\nparticular those relating to the interpretation and application of\r\ninternational agreements, may be submitted to compulsory arbitration\r\nwithout any restriction.\"\r\n\r\nThe above shows reasonable grounds for the hope and expectation that one\r\nof the future Peace Conferences will find a way out of the difficulty\r\nand come to an agreement stipulating compulsory arbitration for a\r\nlimited number of international differences.[26]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: See Scott, _Conferences_, pp. 319-385, where the\r\nproceedings of both the First and Second Peace Conferences concerning\r\ncompulsory arbitration are sketched in a masterly and very lucid style.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Arbitration Treaty and appointment of Arbitrators.]\r\n\r\n§ 20. According to article 52 the conflicting States which resort to\r\narbitration shall sign a special Act, the _Compromis_, in which is\r\nclearly defined: the subject of the dispute; the time allowed for\r\nappointing the arbitrators; the form, order, and time in which the\r\ncommunications referred to in article 63 of Convention I. must be made;\r\nthe amount of the sum which each party must deposit in advance to defray\r\nthe expenses; the manner of appointing arbitrators (if there be\r\noccasion); any special powers which may eventually belong to the\r\nTribunal, where it shall meet, the languages to be used, and any special\r\nconditions upon which the parties may agree. Should, however, the\r\nconflicting States prefer it, the Permanent Court at the Hague is\r\ncompetent to draw up and settle the _Compromis_, and the Court is\r\nlikewise in some other cases competent to settle the _Compromis_\r\n(articles 53-54). The parties may agree to have recourse to the\r\nPermanent Court of Arbitration which was instituted by the Hague\r\nConvention and regarding which details have been given above, Vol. I.,\r\n§§ 472-476, but they may also assign the arbitration to one or several\r\narbitrators chosen by them either from the members of the Permanent\r\nCourt of Arbitration or elsewhere (article 55). If they choose a head of\r\na State as arbitrator, the whole of the arbitral procedure is to be\r\ndetermined by him (article 56). If they choose several arbitrators, an\r\numpire is to preside, but in case they have not chosen an umpire, the\r\narbitrators are to elect one of their own number as president (article\r\n57). If the _Compromis_ is settled by a Commission, as contemplated by\r\narticle 54 of Convention I., and in default of an agreement to the\r\ncontrary, the Commission itself shall form the Arbitration Tribunal\r\n(article 58). In case of death, resignation, or disability of one of the\r\narbitrators from any cause, his place is to be filled in accordance with\r\nthe method of his appointment (article 59). The place of session of the\r\narbitrators is to be determined by the parties; but if they fail to do\r\nit, the place of session is to be the Hague, and the place of session\r\nmay not be changed by the arbitrators without the consent of the\r\nparties; the Tribunal may only sit in the territory of a third State\r\nwith the latter's consent (article 60). The International Bureau of the\r\nCourt at the Hague is authorised to put its offices and its staff at the\r\ndisposal of the contracting Powers in case the parties have preferred to\r\nbring their dispute before arbitrators other than the Permanent Court of\r\nArbitration (article 47).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Procedure of and before the Arbitral Tribunal.]\r\n\r\n§ 21. The parties may agree upon such rules of arbitral procedure as\r\nthey like. If they fail to stipulate special rules of procedure, the\r\nfollowing rules are valid, whether the parties have brought their case\r\nbefore the Permanent Court of Arbitration or have chosen other\r\narbitrators (article 51):--\r\n\r\n(1) The parties may appoint counsel or advocates for the defence of\r\ntheir rights before the tribunal. They may also appoint delegates or\r\nspecial agents to attend the tribunal for the purpose of serving as\r\nintermediaries between them and the tribunal. The members of the\r\nPermanent Court, however, may not act as agents, counsel, or advocates\r\nexcept on behalf of the Power which has appointed them members of the\r\nCourt (article 62).\r\n\r\n(2) The tribunal selects the languages for its own use and for use\r\nbefore it, unless the _Compromis_ has specified the languages to be\r\nemployed (article 61).\r\n\r\n(3) As a rule the arbitral procedure is divided into the two distinct\r\nphases of written pleadings and oral discussions. The written pleadings\r\nconsist of the communication by the respective agents to the members of\r\nthe tribunal and to the opposite party of cases, counter-cases, and, if\r\nnecessary, replies; the parties must annex thereto all papers and\r\ndocuments relied on in the case. This communication is to be made either\r\ndirectly or through the intermediary of the International Bureau, in the\r\norder and within the time fixed by the _Compromis_ (article 63). A duly\r\ncertified copy of every document produced by one party must be\r\ncommunicated to the other party (article 64). Unless special\r\ncircumstances arise, the tribunal does not meet until the pleadings are\r\nclosed (article 65).\r\n\r\n(4) Upon the written pleadings follows the oral discussion in Court; it\r\nconsists of the oral development of the pleas of the parties (article\r\n63, last paragraph). The discussions are under the direction of the\r\npresident of the tribunal, and are public only if it be so decided by\r\nthe tribunal with the consent of the parties. Minutes with regard to the\r\ndiscussion are to be drawn up by secretaries appointed by the president,\r\nand only these official minutes, which are signed by the president and\r\none of the secretaries, are authentic (article 66). During the\r\ndiscussion in Court the agents and counsel of the parties are authorised\r\nto present to the tribunal orally all the arguments they may think\r\nexpedient in support of their case. They are likewise authorised to\r\nraise objections and to make incidental motions, but the decisions of\r\nthe tribunal on these objections and motions are final and cannot form\r\nthe subject of any further discussion (articles 70, 71). Every member of\r\nthe tribunal may put questions to the agents and counsel of the parties\r\nand demand explanations from them on doubtful points, but neither such\r\nquestions nor other remarks made by members of the tribunal may be\r\nregarded as expressions of opinion by the tribunal in general or the\r\nrespective member in particular (article 72). The tribunal may always\r\nrequire from the agents of the parties all necessary explanations and\r\nthe production of all acts, and in case of refusal the tribunal takes\r\nnote of it in the minutes (articles 69).\r\n\r\nWhen the competence of the tribunal is doubted on one or more points,\r\nthe tribunal itself is authorised to decide whether it is or is not\r\ncompetent, by means of interpretation of the _Compromis_ as well as the\r\nother papers and documents which may be adduced in the matter, and by\r\nmeans of the application of the principles of law (article 73).\r\n\r\nDuring the discussion in Court--article 67 says, \"After the close of the\r\npleadings\"--the tribunal is competent to refuse admittance to all such\r\nfresh acts and documents as one party may desire to submit to the\r\ntribunal without the consent of the other party (article 67).\r\nConsequently, the tribunal must admit fresh acts and documents when both\r\nparties agree to their submission. On the other hand, the tribunal is\r\nalways competent to take into consideration fresh papers and documents\r\nto which its attention is drawn by the agents or counsel of the parties,\r\nand in such cases the tribunal may require production of the papers and\r\ndocuments, but it is at the same time obliged to make them known to the\r\nother party (article 68).\r\n\r\nThe parties must supply the tribunal, within the widest limits they may\r\nthink practicable, with all the information required for deciding the\r\ndispute (article 75). For the service of all notices by the tribunal in\r\nthe territory of a third contracting Power, the tribunal applies direct\r\nto the Government of such Power. The same rule is valid in the case of\r\nsteps being necessary in order to procure evidence on the spot. The\r\nrequests for this purpose are to be executed by the Power concerned with\r\nthe means at its disposal according to its Municipal Law; they may not\r\nbe rejected unless the Power concerned considers them of such a nature\r\nas to impair its own sovereign rights or its safety. Instead, however,\r\nof making a direct application to a third Power, the tribunal is always\r\nentitled to have recourse to the intermediary of the Power on whose\r\nterritory it sits (article 76).\r\n\r\nAs soon as the agents and counsel of the parties have submitted all\r\nexplanations and evidence in support of their case, the president\r\ndeclares the discussion closed (article 77).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Arbitral Award.]\r\n\r\n§ 22. The arbitral award is given after a deliberation which has taken\r\nplace behind closed doors, and the proceedings remain secret (article\r\n78). The members of the tribunal vote, and the majority of the votes\r\nmakes the decision of the tribunal. The decision, accompanied by a\r\nstatement of the considerations upon which it is based, is to be drawn\r\nup in writing, to recite the names of the arbitrators, and to be signed\r\nby the president and the registrar or the secretary acting as the\r\nregistrar (article 79). The verdict is read out at a public meeting of\r\nthe tribunal, the agents and counsel of the parties being present or\r\nhaving been duly summoned to attend (article 80).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Binding force of Awards.]\r\n\r\n§ 23. The award, when duly pronounced and notified to the agents of the\r\nparties, decides the dispute finally and without appeal (article 81).\r\nAny dispute arising between the parties as to the interpretation or\r\nexecution of the award must, in default of an agreement to the\r\ncontrary, be submitted to the tribunal which pronounced it (article 82).\r\nThe parties may, however, beforehand stipulate in the _Compromis_ the\r\npossibility of an appeal. In such case, and the _Compromis_ failing to\r\nstipulate the contrary, the demand for a rehearing of the case must be\r\naddressed to the tribunal which pronounced the award. The demand for a\r\nrehearing of the case may only be made on the ground of the discovery of\r\nsome new fact such as may exercise a decisive influence on the award,\r\nand which at the time when the discussion was closed was unknown to the\r\ntribunal as well as to the appealing party. Proceedings for a rehearing\r\nmay only be opened after a decision of the tribunal expressly stating\r\nthe existence of a new fact of the character described, and declaring\r\nthe demand admissible on this ground. The treaty of arbitration must\r\nstipulate the period of time within which the demand for a rehearing\r\nmust be made (article 83).--\r\n\r\nThe Hague Convention contains no stipulation whatever with regard to the\r\nquestion whether the award is binding under all circumstances and\r\nconditions, or whether it is only binding when the tribunal has in every\r\nway fulfilled its duty and has been able to find its verdict in perfect\r\nindependence. But it is obvious that the award has no binding force\r\nwhatever if the tribunal has been bribed or has not followed the\r\nparties' instructions given by the treaty of agreement; if the award was\r\ngiven under the influence of undue coercion; or, lastly, if one of the\r\nparties has intentionally and maliciously led the tribunal into an\r\nessential material error. (See above, § 16).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Award binding upon Parties only.]\r\n\r\n§ 24. The award[27] is binding only upon the parties to the proceedings.\r\nBut when there is a question of interpreting a convention to which\r\nother States than the States at variance are parties, the conflicting\r\nStates have to inform all the contracting Powers of such convention in\r\ngood time. Each of these States has a right to intervene in the case\r\nbefore the tribunal, and, if one or more avail themselves of this right,\r\nthe interpretation contained in the award is as binding upon them as\r\nupon the conflicting parties (article 84).\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: The awards hitherto given are enumerated above, vol. I. §\r\n476, p. 521, but the case of Italy _v._ Peru (Canevaro claim, May 3,\r\n1912) must now be added.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Costs of Arbitration.]\r\n\r\n§ 25. Each party pays its own expenses and an equal share of those of\r\nthe tribunal[28] (article 85).\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: See details in Wehberg, _Kommentar_, pp. 155-158.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Arbitration by Summary Procedure.]\r\n\r\n§ 25_a_. With a view to facilitating the working of arbitration in\r\ndisputes of minor importance admitting an abbreviated procedure, the\r\ncontracting Powers propose the following rules for a summary procedure\r\nexclusively in writing:--\r\n\r\nEach of the conflicting parties appoints an arbitrator, and these\r\narbitrators need not necessarily be members of the Permanent Court of\r\nArbitration. The two arbitrators thus appointed choose a third as\r\numpire, who need not be a member of the Permanent Court either. But if\r\nthey cannot agree upon an umpire, each of them proposes two candidates\r\ntaken from the general list of the Permanent Court of Arbitration\r\nexclusive of such members as are either appointed by the conflicting\r\nStates or are their nationals, and it is to be determined by lot which\r\nof the candidates shall be the umpire. This umpire presides over the\r\ntribunal which gives its decisions by a majority of votes (article 87).\r\nIn the absence of an agreement concerning the matter, the tribunal\r\nsettles the time within which the two parties must submit their\r\nrespective cases to it (article 88). Each party is represented by an\r\nagent who serves as intermediary between the tribunal and his party\r\n(article 89). The proceedings are conducted exclusively in writing. Each\r\nparty, however, is entitled to ask that witnesses and experts should be\r\ncalled, and the tribunal has the right to demand oral explanations from\r\nthe agents as well as from the experts and witnesses whose appearance in\r\nCourt it may consider useful (article 90). Articles 52 to 85 of\r\nConvention I. apply so far as they are not inconsistent with the rules\r\nlaid down in articles 87 to 90 (article 80).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nCOMPULSIVE SETTLEMENT OF STATE DIFFERENCES\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nON COMPULSIVE MEANS OF SETTLEMENT OF STATE DIFFERENCES IN GENERAL\r\n\r\n  Lawrence, § 136--Westlake, II. p. 6--Phillimore, III. §\r\n  7--Pradier-Fodéré, VI. No. 2632--Despagnet, No. 483--Fiore, II.\r\n  No. 1225, and Code, Nos. 1381-1385--Taylor, § 431--Nys, III. pp.\r\n  83-94.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Conception and kinds of Compulsive Means of Settlement.]\r\n\r\n§ 26. Compulsive means of settlement of differences are measures\r\ncontaining a certain amount of compulsion taken by a State for the\r\npurpose of making another State consent to such settlement of a\r\ndifference as is required by the former. There are four different kinds\r\nof such means in use--namely, retorsion, reprisals (including embargo),\r\npacific blockade, and intervention. But it must be mentioned that,\r\nwhereas every amicable means of settling differences might find\r\napplication in every kind of difference, not every compulsive means is\r\napplicable in every difference. For the application of retorsion is\r\nconfined to political, and that of reprisals to legal differences.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Compulsive Means in contradistinction to War.]\r\n\r\n§ 27. War is very often enumerated among the compulsive means of\r\nsettling international differences. This is in a sense correct, for a\r\nState might make war for no other purpose than that of compelling\r\nanother State to settle a difference in the way required before war was\r\ndeclared. Nevertheless, the characteristics of compulsive means of\r\nsettling international differences make it a necessity to draw a sharp\r\nline between these means and war. It is, firstly, characteristic of\r\ncompulsive means that, although they frequently consist of harmful\r\nmeasures, they are neither by the conflicting nor by other States\r\nconsidered as acts of war, and consequently all relations of peace, such\r\nas diplomatic and commercial intercourse, the execution of treaties, and\r\nthe like, remain undisturbed. Compulsive means are in theory and\r\npractice considered peaceable, although not amicable, means of settling\r\ninternational differences. It is, further, characteristic of compulsive\r\nmeans that they are even at their worst confined to the application of\r\ncertain harmful measures only, whereas belligerents in war may apply any\r\namount and any kinds of force, with the exception only of those methods\r\nforbidden by International Law. And, thirdly, it is characteristic of\r\ncompulsive means that their application must cease as soon as their\r\npurpose is realised by the compelled State declaring its readiness to\r\nsettle the difference in the way requested by the compelling State;\r\nwhereas, war once broken out, a belligerent is not obliged to lay down\r\narms if and when the other belligerent is ready to comply with the\r\nrequest made before the war. As war is the _ultima ratio_ between\r\nStates, the victorious belligerent is not legally prevented from\r\nimposing upon the defeated any conditions he likes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Compulsive Means in contradistinction to an Ultimatum and\r\nDemonstrations.]\r\n\r\n§ 28. The above-described characteristics of compulsive means for the\r\nsettlement of international differences make it necessary to mention the\r\ndistinction between such means and an _ultimatum_. The latter is the\r\ntechnical term for a written communication by one State to another which\r\nends amicable negotiations respecting a difference, and formulates, for\r\nthe last time and categorically, the demands to be fulfilled if other\r\nmeasures are to be averted. An _ultimatum_ is, theoretically at least,\r\nnot a compulsion, although it can practically exercise the function of\r\na compulsion, and although compulsive means, or even war, can be\r\nthreatened through the same communication in the event of a refusal to\r\ncomply with the demand made.[29] And the same is valid with regard to\r\nwithdrawal of diplomatic agents, to military and naval demonstrations,\r\nand the like, which some publicists[30] enumerate among the compulsive\r\nmeans of settlement of international differences. Although these steps\r\nmay contrive, indirectly, the settlement of differences, yet they do not\r\ncontain in themselves any compulsion.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: See Pradier-Fodéré, VI.

Retorsion is the technical term for the retaliation of\r\ndiscourteous or unkind or unfair and inequitable acts by acts of the\r\nsame or a similar kind. Retorsion has nothing to do with international\r\ndelinquencies, as it is not a means of compulsion in the case of legal\r\ndifferences, but only in the case of certain political differences. The\r\nact which calls for retaliation is not an illegal act; on the contrary,\r\nit is an act that is within the competence of the doer.[31] But a State\r\ncan commit many legislative, administrative, or judicial acts which,\r\nalthough they are not internationally illegal, contain a discourtesy or\r\nunfriendliness to another State or are unfair and inequitable. If the\r\nState against which such acts are directed considers itself wronged\r\nthereby, a political difference is created which might be settled by\r\nretorsion.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: For this reason--see Heilborn, _System_, p. 352, and\r\nWagner, _Zur Lehre von den Streiterledigungsmitteln des Völkerrechts_\r\n(1900), pp. 53-60--it is correctly maintained that retorsion, in\r\ncontradistinction to reprisals, is not of legal, but only of political\r\nimportance. Nevertheless, a system of the Law of Nations must not omit\r\nthe matter of retorsion altogether, because retorsion is in practice an\r\nimportant means of settling political differences.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Retorsion, when justified.]\r\n\r\n§ 30. The question when retorsion is and when it is not justified is not\r\none of law, and is difficult to answer. The difficulty arises from the\r\nfact that retorsion is a means of settling such differences as are\r\ncreated, not by internationally illegal, but by discourteous or\r\nunfriendly or unfair and inequitable acts of one State against another,\r\nand that naturally the conceptions of discourtesy, unfriendliness, and\r\nunfairness cannot be defined very precisely. It depends, therefore,\r\nlargely upon the circumstances and conditions of the special cases\r\nwhether a State will or will not consider itself justified in making use\r\nof retorsion. In practice States have frequently made use of retorsion\r\nin cases of unfair treatment of their citizens abroad through rigorous\r\npassport regulations, exclusion of foreigners from certain professions,\r\nthe levy of exorbitant protectionist or fiscal duties; further, in cases\r\nof refusal of the usual mutual judicial assistance, refusal of\r\nadmittance of foreign ships to harbours, and in similar cases.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Retorsion, how exercised.]\r\n\r\n§ 31. The essence of retorsion consists in retaliation for a noxious act\r\nby an act of the same kind. But a State in making use of retorsion is by\r\nno means confined to acts of the same kind as those complained of, acts\r\nof a similar kind being equally admissible. However, acts of retorsion\r\nare confined to acts which are not internationally illegal. And,\r\nfurther, as retorsion is made use of only for the purpose of compelling\r\na State to alter its discourteous, unfriendly, or unfair behaviour, all\r\nacts of retorsion ought at once to cease when such State changes its\r\nbehaviour.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Value of Retorsion.]\r\n\r\n§ 32. The value of retorsion as a means of settling certain\r\ninternational differences consists in its compulsory force, which has\r\ngreat power in regulating the intercourse of States. It is a commonplace\r\nof human nature, and by experience constantly confirmed, that evil-doers\r\nare checked by retaliation, and that those who are inclined to commit a\r\nwrong against others are often prevented by the fear of it. Through the\r\nhigh tide of Chauvinism, Protectionism, and unfriendly feelings against\r\nforeign nations, States are often tempted to legislative,\r\nadministrative, and judicial acts against other States which, although\r\nnot internationally illegal, nevertheless endanger friendly relations\r\nand intercourse within the Family of Nations. The certainty of\r\nretaliation is the only force which can make States resist the\r\ntemptation.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nREPRISALS\r\n\r\n  Grotius, III. c. 2--Vattel, II. §§ 342-354--Bynkershoek,\r\n  _Quaestiones jur. publ._ I. c. 24--Hall, § 120--Lawrence, §§\r\n  136-137--Westlake, II. pp. 7-11--Twiss, II. §§ 11-22--Moore, VII.\r\n  §§ 1095, 1096-1098--Taylor, §§ 436-437--Wharton, III. §§\r\n  318-320--Wheaton, §§ 291-293--Bluntschli, §§ 500-504--Heffter, §§\r\n  111-112--Bulmerincq in Holtzendorff, IV. pp. 72-116--Ullmann, §\r\n  160--Bonfils, Nos. 975-985--Despagnet, Nos.\r\n  487-495--Pradier-Fodéré, VI.

Reprisals is the term applied to such injurious and otherwise\r\ninternationally illegal acts of one State against another as are\r\nexceptionally permitted for the purpose of compelling the latter to\r\nconsent to a satisfactory settlement of a difference created by its own\r\ninternational delinquency. Whereas retorsion consists in retaliation of\r\ndiscourteous, unfriendly, unfair, and inequitable acts by acts of the\r\nsame or a similar kind, and has nothing to do with international\r\ndelinquencies, reprisals are acts, otherwise illegal, performed by a\r\nState for the purpose of obtaining justice for an international\r\ndelinquency by taking the law into its own hands. It is, of course,\r\npossible that a State retaliates in consequence of an illegal act\r\ncommitted against itself by the performance of an act of a similar kind.\r\nSuch retaliation would be a retorsion in the ordinary sense of the term,\r\nbut it would not be retorsion in the technical meaning of the term as\r\nused by those writers on International Law who correctly distinguish\r\nbetween retorsion and reprisals.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reprisals admissible for all International Delinquencies.]\r\n\r\n§ 34. Reprisals are admissible not only, as some writers[32] maintain,\r\nin case of denial or delay of justice, or of any other internationally\r\ninterdicted ill-treatment of foreign citizens, but in every case of an\r\ninternational delinquency for which the injured State cannot get\r\nreparation through negotiation,[33] be it ill-treatment of its subjects\r\nabroad through denial or delay of justice or otherwise, or be it\r\nnon-compliance with treaty obligations, violation of the dignity of a\r\nforeign State, violation of foreign territorial supremacy, or any other\r\ninternationally illegal act.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: See, for instance, Twiss, II. § 19.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: As regards reprisals for the non-payment of\r\ncontract-debts, see below, § 41.]\r\n\r\nThus, to give an example, Great Britain, in the case of the Sicilian\r\nSulphur Monopoly, performed acts of reprisal against the Two Sicilies in\r\n1840 for a violation of a treaty. By the treaty of commerce of 1816\r\nbetween the Two Sicilies and Great Britain certain commercial advantages\r\nwere secured to Great Britain. When, in 1838, the Neapolitan Government\r\ngranted a Sulphur Monopoly to a company of French and other foreign\r\nmerchants, Great Britain protested against this violation of her treaty\r\nrights, demanded the revocation of the monopoly, and, after the\r\nNeapolitan Government had declined to comply with this demand, laid an\r\n_embargo_ on Sicilian ships in the harbour of Malta and ordered her\r\nfleet in the Mediterranean to seize Sicilian ships by way of reprisal. A\r\nnumber of vessels were captured, but were restored after the Sicilies\r\nhad, through the mediation of France, agreed to withdraw the grant of\r\nthe Sulphur Monopoly.\r\n\r\nAgain, when in 1908 de Castro, the President of Venezuela, dismissed M.\r\nde Reuss, the Dutch Minister Resident at Caracas, Holland considered\r\nthis step a violation of her dignity and sent cruisers into Venezuelan\r\nwaters with the intention of resorting to reprisals. These cruisers\r\ncaptured the Venezuelan coast-guard ship _Alexis_ outside Puerto\r\nCabello, and another Venezuelan public vessel, both of which, however,\r\nwere restored in 1909, when de Castro was deposed, and the new President\r\nopened negotiations with Holland and settled the conflict.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reprisals admissible for International Delinquencies only.]\r\n\r\n§ 35. Reprisals are admissible in the case of international\r\ndelinquencies only and exclusively. As internationally injurious\r\nacts on the part of administrative and judicial officials, armed forces,\r\nand private individuals are not _ipso facto_ international\r\ndelinquencies, no reprisals are admissible in the case of such\r\nacts if the responsible State complies with the requirements of its\r\nvicarious responsibility.[34] Should, however, a State refuse to comply\r\nwith these requirements, its vicarious responsibility would turn into\r\noriginal responsibility, and thereby an international delinquency would\r\nbe created for which reprisals are indeed admissible.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: See above, vol. I. §§ 149 and 150.]\r\n\r\nThe reprisals ordered by Great Britain in the case of Don Pacifico are\r\nan illustrative example of unjustified reprisals, because no\r\ninternational delinquency was committed. In 1847 a riotous mob, aided by\r\nGreek soldiers and gendarmes, broke into and plundered the house of Don\r\nPacifico, a native of Gibraltar and an English subject living at Athens.\r\nGreat Britain claimed damages from Greece without previous recourse by\r\nDon Pacifico to the Greek Courts. Greece refused to comply with the\r\nBritish claim, maintaining correctly that Don Pacifico ought to\r\ninstitute an action for damages against the rioters before the Greek\r\nCourts. Great Britain continued to press her claim, and finally in 1850\r\nblockaded the Greek coast and ordered, by way of reprisal, the capture\r\nof Greek vessels. The conflict was eventually settled by Greece paying\r\n£150 to Don Pacifico. It is generally recognised that England had no\r\nright to act as she did in this case. She could have claimed damages\r\ndirectly from the Greek Government only after the Greek Courts had\r\ndenied satisfaction to Don Pacifico.[35]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: See above, vol. I. § 167. The case is reported with all\r\nits details in Martens, _Causes Célèbres_, V. pp. 395-531.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reprisals, by whom performed.]\r\n\r\n§ 36. Acts of reprisal may nowadays be performed only by State organs\r\nsuch as armed forces, or men-of-war, or administrative officials, in\r\ncompliance with a special order of their State. But in former times\r\nprivate individuals used to perform acts of reprisal. Such private acts\r\nof reprisal seem to have been in vogue in antiquity, for there existed a\r\nlaw in Athens according to which the relatives of an Athenian murdered\r\nabroad had, in case the foreign State refused punishment or extradition\r\nof the murderer, the right to seize and to bring before the Athenian\r\nCourts three citizens of such foreign State (so-called ἀνδροληψία).\r\nDuring the Middle Ages, and even in modern times to the end\r\nof the eighteenth century, States used to grant so-called \"Letters\r\nof Marque\" to such of their subjects as had been injured abroad either\r\nby a foreign State itself or its citizens without being able to get\r\nredress. These Letters of Marque authorised the bearer to acts of\r\nself-help against the State concerned, its citizens and their property,\r\nfor the purpose of obtaining satisfaction for the wrong sustained. In\r\nlater times, however, States themselves also performed acts of reprisal.\r\nThereby acts of reprisal on the part of private individuals fell more\r\nand more into disuse, and finally disappeared totally with the end of\r\nthe eighteenth century. The distinction between general and special\r\nreprisals, which used formerly to be drawn, is based on the fact that in\r\nformer times a State could either authorise a single private individual\r\nto perform an act of reprisal (_special_ reprisals), or command its\r\narmed forces to perform all kinds of such acts (_general_ reprisals).\r\nThe term \"General Reprisals\" is by Great Britain nowadays used for the\r\nauthorisation of the British fleet to seize in time of war all enemy\r\nships and goods. Phillimore (III. § 10) cites the following Order in\r\nCouncil of March 27, 1854: \"Her Majesty having determined to afford\r\nactive assistance to her ally, His Highness the Sultan of the Ottoman\r\nEmpire, for the protection of his dominions against the encroachments\r\nand unprovoked aggression of His Imperial Majesty the Emperor of All the\r\nRussias, Her Majesty is therefore pleased, by and with the advice of Her\r\nPrivy Council, to order, and it is hereby ordered, that general\r\nreprisals be granted against the ships, vessels, and goods of the\r\nEmperor of All the Russias, and of his subjects, or others inhabiting\r\nwithin any of his countries, territories or dominions, so that Her\r\nMajesty's fleets may lawfully seize all ships, vessels, and goods,\" &c.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Objects of Reprisals.]\r\n\r\n§ 37. An act of reprisal may be performed against anything and\r\neverything that belongs or is due to the delinquent State or its\r\ncitizens. Ships sailing under its flag may be seized, treaties concluded\r\nwith it may be suspended, a part of its territory may be militarily\r\noccupied, goods belonging to it or to its citizens may be seized, and\r\nthe like. Thus in 1895 Great Britain ordered a fleet to land forces at\r\nCorinto and to occupy the custom-house and other Government buildings as\r\nan act of reprisal against Nicaragua; again, in 1901 France ordered a\r\nfleet to seize the island of Mitylene as an act of reprisal against\r\nTurkey; and in 1908 Holland ordered a squadron to seize two public\r\nVenezuelan vessels as an act of reprisal against Venezuela.[36] The\r\npersons of the officials and even of the private citizens of the\r\ndelinquent State are not excluded from the possible objects of\r\nreprisals. Thus, when in 1740 the Empress Anne of Russia arrested\r\nwithout just cause the Baron de Stackelberg, a natural-born Russian\r\nsubject, who had, however, become naturalised in Prussia by entering the\r\nlatter's service, Frederick II. of Prussia seized by way of reprisal two\r\nRussian subjects and detained them until Stackelberg was liberated. But\r\nit must be emphasised that the only act of reprisal admissible with\r\nregard to foreign officials or citizens is arrest; they must not be\r\ntreated like criminals, but like hostages, and under no condition or\r\ncircumstance may they be executed or subjected to punishment of any\r\nkind.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: See above, § 34.]\r\n\r\nThe rule that anything and everything belonging to the delinquent State\r\nmay be made the object of reprisals has, however, exceptions; for\r\ninstance, individuals enjoying the privilege of exterritoriality while\r\nabroad, such as heads of States and diplomatic envoys, may not be made\r\nthe object of reprisals, although this has occasionally been done in\r\npractice.[37] In regard to another exception--namely, public debts of\r\nsuch State as intends performing reprisals--unanimity does not exist\r\neither in theory or in practice. When Frederick II. of Prussia in 1752,\r\nby way of negative reprisals for an alleged injustice of British Prize\r\nCourts against Prussian subjects, refused the payment of the Silesian\r\nloan due to English creditors, Great Britain, in addition to denying the\r\nquestion that there was at all a just cause for reprisals, maintained\r\nthat public debts may not be made the object of reprisals. English\r\njurists and others, as, for instance, Vattel (II. § 344), consent to\r\nthis, but German writers dissent.[38]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: See the case reported in Martens, _Causes Célèbres_, I. p.\r\n35.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: See Phillimore, III. § 22, in contradistinction to\r\nHeffter, § 111, note 5. The case is reported with all its details in\r\nMartens, _Causes Célèbres_, II. pp. 97-168. The dispute was settled in\r\n1756--see below, § 437--through Great Britain paying an indemnity of\r\n£20,000.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Positive and Negative Reprisals.]\r\n\r\n§ 38. Reprisals can be positive or negative. One speaks of positive\r\nreprisals when such acts are performed as would under ordinary\r\ncircumstances involve an international delinquency. On the other hand,\r\nnegative reprisals consist of refusals to perform such acts as are under\r\nordinary circumstances obligatory; when, for instance, the fulfilment of\r\na treaty obligation or the payment of a debt is refused.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reprisals must be proportionate.]\r\n\r\n§ 39. Reprisals, be they positive or negative, must be in proportion to\r\nthe wrong done and to the amount of compulsion necessary to get\r\nreparation. For instance, a State would not be justified in arresting by\r\nway of reprisal thousands of foreign subjects living on its territory\r\nwhose home State had injured it through a denial of justice to one of\r\nits subjects living abroad. But it would in such case be justified in\r\nordering its own Courts to deny justice to all subjects of such foreign\r\nState, or in ordering its fleet to seize several vessels sailing under\r\nthe latter State's flag, or in suspending its commercial treaty with\r\nsuch State.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Embargo.]\r\n\r\n§ 40. A kind of reprisal, which is called _Embargo_, must be specially\r\nmentioned. This term of Spanish origin means detention, but in\r\nInternational Law it has the technical meaning of detention of ships in\r\nport. Now, as by way of reprisal all acts, otherwise illegal, may be\r\nperformed, there is no doubt that ships of the delinquent State may be\r\nprevented from leaving the ports of the injured State for the purpose of\r\ncompelling the delinquent State to make reparation for the wrong\r\ndone.[39]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: Thus in 1840--see above, § 34--Great Britain laid an\r\nembargo on Sicilian ships.]\r\n\r\nThe matter would not need special mention were it not for the fact that\r\n_embargo_ by way of reprisal is to be distinguished from detention of\r\nships for other reasons. According to a now obsolete[40] rule of\r\nInternational Law, conflicting States could, when war was breaking out\r\nor impending, lay an _embargo_ on, and appropriate each other's\r\nmerchantmen. Another kind of _embargo_ is the so-called _arrêt de\r\nprince_[41]--that is, a detention of foreign ships for the purpose of\r\npreventing them from spreading news of political importance. And there\r\nis, thirdly, an _embargo_ arising out of the so-called _jus\r\nangariæ_--that is, the right of a belligerent State to seize and make\r\nuse of neutral property in case of necessity, under the obligation to\r\ncompensate the neutral owner of such property. States have in the\r\npast[42] made use of this kind of _embargo_ when they had not enough\r\nships for the necessary transport of troops, ammunition, and the like.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40: See, however, below, § 102_a_ and article 1 of Convention\r\nVI., which only stipulates that it is _desirable_ that enemy vessels in\r\nthe port of a belligerent at the outbreak of war should be allowed to\r\ndepart freely; see also article 2 of Convention VI.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 41: See Steck, _Versuch über Handels-und Schiffahrts-Verträge_\r\n(1782), p. 355; Caumont, _Dictionnaire universel de droit maritime_\r\n(1867), pp. 247-265; Calvo, III. § 1277; Pradier-Fodéré, V. p. 719;\r\nHoltzendorff, IV. pp. 98-104.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 42: See below, § 364.]\r\n\r\nThese kinds of international _embargo_ must not be confounded with the\r\nso-called _civil embargo_ of English Municipal Law[43]--namely, the\r\norder of the Sovereign to English ships not to leave English ports.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 43: See Phillimore, III. § 26.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reprisals to be preceded by Negotiations and to be stopped\r\nwhen Reparation is made.]\r\n\r\n§ 41. Like all other compulsive means of settling international\r\ndifferences, reprisals are admissible only after negotiations have been\r\nconducted in vain for the purpose of obtaining reparation from the\r\ndelinquent State. In former times, when States used to authorise private\r\nindividuals to perform special reprisals, treaties of commerce and peace\r\nfrequently stipulated for a certain period of time, for instance three\r\nor four months, to elapse after an application for redress before the\r\ngrant of Letters of Marque by the injured State.[44] Although with the\r\ndisappearance of special reprisals this is now antiquated, a reasonable\r\ntime for the performance of a reparation must even nowadays be given. On\r\nthe other hand, reprisals must at once cease when the delinquent State\r\nmakes the necessary reparation. Individuals arrested must be set free,\r\ngoods and ships seized must be handed back, occupied territory must be\r\nevacuated, suspended treaties must again be put into force, and the\r\nlike.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: See Phillimore, III. § 14.]\r\n\r\nIt must be specially mentioned that in the case of recovery of contract\r\ndebts claimed from the Government of one country by the Government of\r\nanother country as being due to its nationals, reprisals by means of\r\narmed forces can, according to article 1 of Convention II., only be\r\nresorted to in case the debtor State refuses to go to arbitration.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reprisals during Peace in contradistinction to Reprisals\r\nduring War.]\r\n\r\n§ 42. Reprisals in time of peace must not be confounded with reprisals\r\nbetween belligerents. Whereas the former are resorted to for the purpose\r\nof settling a conflict without going to war, the latter[45] are\r\nretaliations to force an enemy guilty of a certain act of illegitimate\r\nwarfare to comply with the laws of war.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 45: See below, § 247.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Value of Reprisals.]\r\n\r\n§ 43. The value of reprisals as a means of settling international\r\ndifferences is analogous to the value of retorsion. States will have\r\nrecourse to reprisals for such international delinquencies as they think\r\ninsufficiently important for a declaration of war, but too important to\r\nbe entirely overlooked. That reprisals are rather a rough means for the\r\nsettlement of differences, and that the institution of reprisals can\r\ngive and has in the past given occasion to abuse in case of a difference\r\nbetween a powerful and a weak State, cannot be denied. On the other\r\nhand, as there is no Court and no central authority above the Sovereign\r\nStates which could compel a delinquent State to give reparation, the\r\ninstitution of reprisals can scarcely be abolished. The influence in the\r\nfuture of the existence of a Permanent Court of Arbitration remains to\r\nbe seen. If all the States would become parties to the Hague Convention\r\nfor the peaceful adjustment of international differences, and if they\r\nwould have recourse to the Permanent Court of Arbitration at the Hague\r\nin all cases of an alleged international delinquency which affects\r\nneither their national honour nor their vital interests and\r\nindependence, acts of reprisal would almost disappear.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nPACIFIC BLOCKADE\r\n\r\n  Hall, § 121--Lawrence, § 138--Westlake, II. pp. 11-18--Taylor, §\r\n  444--Moore, VII. § 1097--Bluntschli, §§ 506-507--Heffter, §\r\n  112--Bulmerincq in Holtzendorff, IV. pp. 116-127--Ullmann, §\r\n  162--Bonfils, Nos. 986-994--Despagnet, Nos.\r\n  496-498--Pradier-Fodéré, V.

Before the nineteenth century blockade was only known as a measure\r\nbetween belligerents in time of war. It was not until the second quarter\r\nof the nineteenth century that the first case occurred of a so-called\r\npacific blockade--that is, a blockade during time of peace--as a\r\ncompulsive means of settling international differences; and all such\r\ncases are either cases of intervention or of reprisals.[46] The first\r\ncase, one of intervention, happened in 1827, when, during the Greek\r\ninsurrection, Great Britain, France, and Russia intervened in the\r\ninterest of the independence of Greece and blockaded those parts of the\r\nGreek coast which were occupied by Turkish troops. Although this\r\nblockade led to the battle of Navarino, in which the Turkish fleet was\r\ndestroyed, the Powers maintained, nevertheless, that they were not at\r\nwar with Turkey. In 1831, France blockaded the Tagus as an act of\r\nreprisal for the purpose of exacting redress from Portugal for injuries\r\nsustained by French subjects. Great Britain and France, exercising\r\nintervention for the purpose of making Holland consent to the\r\nindependence of revolting Belgium, blockaded in 1833 the coast of\r\nHolland. In 1838, France blockaded the ports of Mexico as an act of\r\nreprisal, but Mexico declared war against France in answer to this\r\npacific blockade. Likewise as an act of reprisal, and in the same year,\r\nFrance blockaded the ports of Argentina; and in 1845, conjointly with\r\nGreat Britain, France blockaded the ports of Argentina a second time. In\r\n1850, in the course of her differences with Greece on account of the\r\ncase of Don Pacifico,[47] Great Britain blockaded the Greek ports, but\r\nfor Greek vessels only. Another case of intervention was the pacific\r\nblockade instituted in 1860 by Sardinia, in aid of an insurrection\r\nagainst the then Sicilian ports of Messina and Gaeta, but the following\r\nyear saw the conversion of the pacific blockade into a war blockade. In\r\n1862 Great Britain by way of reprisal for the plundering of a wrecked\r\nBritish merchantman, blockaded the Brazilian port of Rio de Janeiro. The\r\nblockade of the island of Formosa by France during her differences with\r\nChina in 1884 and that of the port of Menam by France during her\r\ndifferences with Siam in 1893 are likewise cases of reprisals. On the\r\nother hand, cases of intervention are the blockade of the Greek coast in\r\n1886 by Great Britain, Austria-Hungary, Germany, Italy, and Russia, for\r\nthe purpose of preventing Greece from making war against Turkey; and\r\nfurther, the blockade of the island of Crete in 1897 by the united\r\nPowers. The last case occurred in 1902, when Great Britain, Germany,\r\nand Italy blockaded, by way of reprisal, the coast of Venezuela.[48]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 46: A blockade instituted by a State against such portions of\r\nits own territory as are in revolt is not a blockade for the purpose of\r\nsettling international differences. It has, therefore, in itself nothing\r\nto do with the Law of Nations, but is a matter of internal police. I\r\ncannot, therefore, agree with Holland, who, in his _Studies in\r\nInternational Law_, p. 138, treats it as a pacific blockade _sensu\r\ngenerali_. Of course, necessity of self-preservation only can justify a\r\nState that has blockaded one of its own ports in preventing the egress\r\nand ingress of _foreign_ vessels. And the question might arise whether\r\ncompensation ought not to be paid for losses sustained by foreign\r\nvessels so detained.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 47: See above, § 35.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 48: This blockade, although ostensibly a war blockade for the\r\npurpose of preventing the ingress of foreign vessels, was nevertheless\r\nessentially a pacific blockade. See Holland, in _The Law Quarterly\r\nReview_, XIX. (1903), p. 133; Parliamentary Papers, Venezuela, No. 1\r\n(Venezuela), Correspondence respecting the Affairs of Venezuela.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Admissibility of Pacific Blockade.]\r\n\r\n§ 45. No unanimity exists among international lawyers with regard to the\r\nquestion whether or not pacific blockades are admissible according to\r\nthe principles of the Law of Nations. There is no doubt that the theory\r\nof the Law of Nations forbids the seizure and sequestration of vessels\r\nother than those of the blockaded State caught in an attempt to break a\r\npacific blockade. For even those writers who maintain the admissibility\r\nof pacific blockade assert that vessels of third States cannot be\r\nseized. What is controverted is the question whether according to\r\nInternational Law the coast of a State may be blockaded at all in time\r\nof peace. From the first recorded instance to the last, several\r\nwriters[49] of authority have negatived the question. On the other hand,\r\nmany writers have answered the question in the affirmative, differing\r\namong themselves regarding the one point only whether or not vessels\r\nsailing under the flag of third States could be prevented from entering\r\nor leaving pacifically blockaded ports. The Institute of International\r\nLaw in 1887 carefully studied, and at its meeting in Heidelberg\r\ndiscussed, the question, and finally voted a declaration[50] in favour\r\nof the admissibility of pacific blockades. Thus the most influential\r\nbody of theorists has approved what had been established before by\r\npractice. There ought to be no doubt that the numerous cases of pacific\r\nblockade which have occurred during the nineteenth century have, through\r\ntacit consent of the members of the Family of Nations, established the\r\nadmissibility of pacific blockades for the settlement of political as\r\nwell as of legal international differences.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 49: The leader of these writers is Hautefeuille, _Des Droits\r\net des Devoirs des Nations Neutres_ (2nd ed. 1858, pp. 272-288).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 50: See _Annuaire_, IX. (1887), pp. 275-301.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pacific Blockade and vessels of third States.]\r\n\r\n§ 46. It has already been stated that those writers who admit the\r\nlegality of pacific blockades are unanimous regarding the fact that no\r\nright exists for the blockading State to seize and sequestrate such\r\nships of third States as try to break a pacific blockade. Apart from\r\nthis, no unanimity exists with regard to the question of the relation\r\nbetween a pacific blockade and ships of third States. Some German\r\nwriters[51] maintain that such ships have to respect the blockade, and\r\nthat the blockading State has a right to stop such ships of third States\r\nas try to break a pacific blockade. The vast majority of writers,\r\nhowever, deny such right. There is, in fact, no rule of International\r\nLaw which could establish such a right, as pacific in contradistinction\r\nto belligerent blockade is a mere matter between the conflicting\r\nparties. The declaration of the Institute of International Law in favour\r\nof pacific blockade contains, therefore, the condition: \"Les navires de\r\npavillons neutres peuvent entrer librement malgré le blocus.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 51: See Heffter, § 112; Perels, § 30.]\r\n\r\nThe practice of pacific blockade has varied with regard to ships of\r\nthird States. Before 1850 ships of third States were expected to respect\r\na pacific blockade, and such ships of these States as tried to break it\r\nwere seized, but were restored at the termination of the blockade, yet\r\nwithout any compensation. When in 1850 Great Britain, and likewise when\r\nin 1886 Great Britain, Austria, Germany, Italy, and Russia blockaded the\r\nGreek ports, these ports were only closed for Greek ships, and others\r\nwere allowed to pass through. And the same was the case during the\r\nblockade of Crete in 1897. On the other hand, in 1894, France, during a\r\nconflict with China, blockaded the island of Formosa and tried to\r\nenforce the blockade against ships of third States. But Great Britain\r\ndeclared that a pacific blockade could not be enforced against ships of\r\nthird States, whereupon France had to drop her intended establishment of\r\na pacific blockade and had to consider herself at war with China. And\r\nwhen in 1902 Great Britain, Germany, and Italy instituted a blockade\r\nagainst Venezuela, they declared it a war blockade[52] because they\r\nintended to enforce it against vessels of third States.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 52: That this blockade was essentially a pacific blockade I\r\nhave already stated above, p. 50, note 1.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pacific Blockade and vessels of the blockaded State.]\r\n\r\n§ 47. Theory and practice seem nowadays to agree upon the rule that the\r\nships of a pacifically blockaded State trying to break the blockade may\r\nbe seized and sequestrated. But they may not be condemned and\r\nconfiscated, as they have to be restored at the termination of the\r\nblockade. Thus, although the Powers which had instituted a blockade\r\nagainst Venezuela in 1902 declared it a war blockade, all Venezuelan\r\npublic and private ships seized were restored after the blockade was\r\nraised.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Manner of Pacific Blockade.]\r\n\r\n§ 48. Pacific blockade is a measure of such enormous consequences that\r\nit can be justified only after the failure of preceding negotiations for\r\nthe purpose of settling the questions in dispute. And further, as\r\nblockade, being a violation of the territorial supremacy of the\r\nblockaded State, is _prima facie_ of a hostile character, it is\r\nnecessary for such State as intends in time of peace to blockade another\r\nState to notify its intention to the latter and to fix the day and hour\r\nfor the establishment of the blockade. And, thirdly, although the\r\nDeclaration of Paris of 1856 enacting that a blockade to be binding must\r\nbe effective concerns blockades in time of war only, there can be no\r\ndoubt that pacific blockades ought to be likewise effective. The\r\ndeclaration of the Institute of International Law in favour of pacific\r\nblockade contains, therefore, the condition: \"Le blocus pacifique doit\r\nêtre déclaré et notifié officiellement, et maintenu par une force\r\nsuffisante.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Value of Pacific Blockade.]\r\n\r\n§ 49. As the establishment of a pacific blockade has in various\r\ninstances not prevented the outbreak of hostilities, the value of a\r\npacific blockade as a means of non-hostile settlement of international\r\ndifferences is doubted and considered uncertain by many writers. But\r\nothers agree, and I think they are right, that the institution of\r\npacific blockade is of great value, be it as an act of reprisal or of\r\nintervention. Every measure which is suitable and calculated to prevent\r\nthe outbreak of war must be welcomed, and experience shows that pacific\r\nblockade is, although not universally successful, a measure of this\r\nkind. That it can give, and has in the past given, occasion for abuse in\r\ncase of a difference between a strong and a weak Power is no argument\r\nagainst it, as the same is valid with regard to reprisals and\r\nintervention in general, and even to war. And although it is naturally a\r\nmeasure which will scarcely be made use of in case of a difference\r\nbetween two powerful naval States, it might nevertheless find\r\napplication with success against a powerful naval State if exercised by\r\nthe united navies of several Powers.[53]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 53: The following is the full text of the declaration of the\r\nInstitute of International Law referred to above, § 45:\r\n\r\n  \"L'établissement d'un blocus en dehors de l'état de guerre ne doit\r\n  être considéré comme permis par le droit de gens que sous les\r\n  conditions suivantes:\r\n\r\n  \"1. Les navires de pavillon étranger peuvent entrer librement\r\n  malgré le blocus.\r\n\r\n  \"2. Le blocus pacifique doit être déclaré et notifié\r\n  officiellement et maintenu par une force suffisante.\r\n\r\n  \"3. Les navires de la puissance bloquée qui ne respectent pas un\r\n  pareil blocus, peuvent être séquestrés. Le blocus ayant cessé, ils\r\n  doivent être restitués avec leurs cargaisons à leurs\r\n  propriétaires, mais sans dédommagement à aucun titre.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nINTERVENTION\r\n\r\n  See the literature quoted above in vol. I. at the commencement of\r\n  § 134.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Intervention in contradistinction to Participation in a\r\ndifference.]\r\n\r\n§ 50. Intervention as a means of settling international differences is\r\nonly a special kind of intervention in general, which has already been\r\ndiscussed.[54] It consists in the dictatorial interference of a third\r\nState in a difference between two States for the purpose of settling the\r\ndifference in the way demanded by the intervening State. This\r\ndictatorial interference takes place for the purpose of exercising a\r\ncompulsion upon one or both of the parties in conflict, and must be\r\ndistinguished from such attitude of a State as makes it a party to the\r\nvery conflict. If two States are in conflict and a third State joins one\r\nof them out of friendship or from any other motive, such third State\r\ndoes not exercise an intervention as a means of settling international\r\ndifferences, but becomes a party to the conflict. If, for instance, an\r\nalliance exists between one of two States in conflict and a third, and\r\nif eventually, as war has broken out in consequence of the conflict,\r\nsuch third State comes to the help of its ally, no intervention in the\r\ntechnical sense of the term takes place. A State intervening in a\r\ndispute between two other States does not become a party to their\r\ndispute, but is the author of a new imbroglio, because such third State\r\ndictatorially requests those other States to settle their difference in\r\na way to which both, or at any rate one of them, objects. An\r\nintervention, for instance, takes place when, although two States in\r\nconflict have made up their minds to fight it out in war, a third State\r\ndictatorially requests them to settle their dispute through arbitration.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 54: See above, vol. I. §§ 134-138.]\r\n\r\nIntervention, in the form of dictatorial interference, must, further, be\r\ndistinguished from such efforts of a State as are directed to induce the\r\nStates in conflict to settle their difference amicably by proffering its\r\ngood offices or mediation, or by giving friendly advice. It is,\r\ntherefore, incorrect when some jurists[55] speak of good offices and the\r\nlike as an \"amicable\" in contradistinction to a \"hostile\" intervention.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 55: Thus, for instance, Rivier, II. § 58. See also above, vol.\r\nI. § 134.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mode of Intervention.]\r\n\r\n§ 51. Intervention in a difference between two States is exercised\r\nthrough a communication of the intervening State to one or both of the\r\nconflicting States with a dictatorial request for the settlement of the\r\nconflict in a certain way, for instance by arbitration or by the\r\nacceptance of certain terms. An intervention can take place either on\r\nthe part of one State alone or of several States collectively. If the\r\nparties comply with the request of the intervening State or States, the\r\nintervention is terminated. If, however, one or both of the parties fail\r\nto comply with the request, the intervening State will either withdraw\r\nits intervention or proceed to the performance of acts more stringent\r\nthan a mere request, such as pacific blockade, military occupation, and\r\nthe like. Even war can be declared for the purpose of an intervention.\r\nOf special importance are the collective interventions exercised by\r\nseveral great Powers in the interest of the balance of power and of\r\nhumanity.[56]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 56: See above, vol. I. §§ 136 and 137.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Time of Intervention.]\r\n\r\n§ 52. An intervention in a difference between two States can take place\r\nat any time from the moment a conflict arises till the moment it is\r\nsettled, and even immediately after the settlement. In many cases\r\ninterventions have taken place before the outbreak of war between two\r\nStates for the purpose of preventing war; in other cases third States\r\nhave intervened during a war which had broken out in consequence of a\r\nconflict. Interventions have, further, taken place immediately after the\r\npeaceable settlement of a difference, or after the termination of war by\r\na treaty of peace or by conquest, on the grounds that the conditions of\r\nthe settlement or the treaty of peace were against the interests of the\r\nintervening State, or because the latter would not consent to the\r\nannexation of the conquered State by the victor.[57]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 57: With regard to the question of the right of intervention,\r\nthe admissibility of intervention in default of a right, and to all\r\nother details concerning intervention, the reader must be referred\r\nabove, vol. I. §§ 135-138.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\nWAR\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nON WAR IN GENERAL\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nCHARACTERISTICS OF WAR\r\n\r\n  Grotius, I. c. 1, § 2--Vattel, III. §§ 1-4, 69-72--Hall, §§\r\n  15-18--Westlake, II. pp. 1-6--Lawrence, § 135--Lorimer, II. pp.\r\n  18-28--Manning, pp. 131-133--Phillimore, III. § 49--Twiss, II. §§\r\n  22-29--Taylor, §§ 449-451--Wheaton, § 295--Bluntschli, §§\r\n  510-514--Heffter, §§ 113-114--Lueder in Holtzendorff, IV. pp.\r\n  175-198--Klüber, §§ 235-237--G.

As within the boundaries of the modern State an armed contention\r\nbetween two or more citizens is illegal, public opinion has become\r\nconvinced that armed contests between citizens are inconsistent with\r\nMunicipal Law. Influenced by this fact, impatient pacifists, as well as\r\nthose innumerable individuals who cannot grasp the idea of a law between\r\nSovereign States, frequently consider war and law inconsistent. They\r\nquote the fact that wars are frequently waged by States as a proof\r\nagainst the very existence of an International Law. It is not difficult\r\nto show the absurdity of this opinion. As States are Sovereign, and as\r\nconsequently no central authority can exist above them able to enforce\r\ncompliance with its demands, war cannot, under the existing conditions\r\nand circumstances of the Family of Nations, always be avoided.\r\nInternational Law recognises this fact, but at the same time provides\r\nregulations with which belligerents have to comply. Although with the\r\noutbreak of war peaceable relations between the belligerents cease,\r\nthere remain certain mutual legal obligations and duties. Thus war is\r\nnot inconsistent with, but a condition regulated by, International Law.\r\nThe latter at present cannot and does not object to States which are in\r\nconflict waging war upon each other instead of peaceably settling their\r\ndifference. But if they choose to go to war they have to comply with the\r\nrules laid down by International Law regarding the conduct of war and\r\nthe relations between belligerents and neutral States. That\r\nInternational Law, if it could forbid war altogether, would be a more\r\nperfect law than it is at present there is no doubt. Yet eternal peace\r\nis an impossibility in the conditions and circumstances under which\r\nmankind at present live and will have to live for a long time to come,\r\nalthough eternal peace is certainly an ideal of civilisation which will\r\nslowly and gradually be realised.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Conception of War.]\r\n\r\n§ 54. War is the contention between two or more States through their\r\narmed forces for the purpose of overpowering each other and imposing\r\nsuch conditions of peace as the victor pleases. War is a fact\r\nrecognised, and with regard to many points regulated, but not\r\nestablished, by International Law. Those writers[58] who define war as\r\nthe legal remedy of self-help to obtain satisfaction for a wrong\r\nsustained from another State, forget that wars have often been waged by\r\nboth parties engaged for political reasons only; they confound a\r\npossible but not at all necessary cause of war with the conception of\r\nwar. A State may be driven into war because it cannot otherwise get\r\nreparation for an international delinquency, and such State may then\r\nmaintain that it exercises by war nothing else than legally recognised\r\nself-help. But when States are driven into or deliberately wage war for\r\npolitical reasons, no legally recognised act of self-help is in such\r\ncase performed by the war. And the same laws of war are valid, whether\r\nwars are waged on account of legal or of political differences.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 58: See, for instance, Vattel, III. § 1; Phillimore, III. §\r\n49; Twiss, II. § 26; Bluntschli, § 510; Bulmerincq, § 92.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: War a contention.]\r\n\r\n§ 55. In any case, it is universally recognised that war is a\r\n_contention_, which means, _a violent struggle through the application\r\nof armed force_. For a war to be in existence, two or more States must\r\nactually have their armed forces fighting against each other, although\r\nthe commencement of a war may date back to its declaration or some other\r\nunilateral initiative act. Unilateral acts of force performed by one\r\nState against another without a previous declaration of war may be a\r\ncause of the outbreak of war, but are not war in themselves, as long as\r\nthey are not answered by similar hostile acts by the other side, or at\r\nleast by a declaration of the other side that it considers the\r\nparticular acts as acts of war. Thus it comes about that acts of force\r\nperformed by one State against another by way of reprisal or during a\r\npacific blockade in the case of an intervention are not necessarily\r\ninitiative acts of war. And even acts of force illegally performed by\r\none State against another, such, for instance, as occupation of a part\r\nof its territory, are not acts of war so long as they are not met with\r\nacts of force from the other side, or at least with a declaration from\r\nthe latter that it considers the particular acts as acts of war. Thus,\r\nwhen Louis XIV. of France, after the Peace of Nimeguen, instituted the\r\nso-called Chambers of Reunion and in 1680 and 1681 seized the territory\r\nof the then Free Town of Strassburg and other parts of the German\r\nEmpire without the latter's offering armed resistance, these acts of\r\nforce, although doubtless illegal, were not acts of war.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: War a contention between States.]\r\n\r\n§ 56. To be considered war, the contention must be going on _between\r\nStates_. In the Middle Ages wars were known between private individuals,\r\nso-called private wars, and wars between corporations, as the Hansa for\r\ninstance, and between States. But such wars have totally disappeared in\r\nmodern times. It may, of course, happen that a contention arises between\r\nthe armed forces of a State and a body of armed individuals, but such\r\ncontention[59] is not war. Thus the contention between the Raiders under\r\nDr. Jameson and the former South African Republic in January 1896 was\r\nnot war. Nor is a contention with insurgents or with pirates a war. And\r\na so-called civil war[60] need not be from the beginning nor become at\r\nall a war in the technical sense of the term according to International\r\nLaw. On the other hand, to an armed contention between a suzerain and\r\nits vassal[61] State the character of war ought not to be denied, for\r\nboth parties are States, although the fact that the vassal makes war\r\nagainst the suzerain may, from the standpoint of Constitutional Law, be\r\nconsidered rebellion. And likewise an armed contention between a full\r\nSovereign State and a State under the suzerainty of another State, as,\r\nfor instance, the contention between Servia and Bulgaria[62] in 1885, is\r\nwar. Again, an armed contention between one or more member-States of a\r\nFederal State and the latter ought to be considered as war in the\r\ntechnical sense of the term, according to International Law, although,\r\naccording to the constitution of Federal States, war between the\r\nmember-States as well as between any member-State and the Federal State\r\nitself is illegal, and recourse to arms by a member-State may therefore\r\ncorrectly, from the standpoint of the constitution, be called rebellion.\r\nThus the War of Secession within the United States between the Northern\r\nand the Southern member-States in 1861-1865 was real war.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 59: Some publicists maintain, however, that a contention\r\nbetween a State and the armed forces of a party fighting for public\r\nrights must be considered as war. See, for instance, Bluntschli, § 113,\r\nand Fiore, III. § 1265.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 60: See below, § 59.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 61: See below, § 75.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 62: Bulgaria was at that time still a vassal State under\r\nTurkish suzerainty.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: War a contention between States through armed forces.]\r\n\r\n§ 57. It must be emphasised that war nowadays is a contention of States\r\n_through their armed forces_. Those private subjects of the belligerents\r\nwho do not directly or indirectly belong to the armed forces do not take\r\npart in the armed contention: they do not attack and defend, and no\r\nattack is therefore made upon them. This fact is the result of an\r\nevolution of practices totally different from those in vogue in former\r\ntimes. During antiquity and the greater part of the Middle Ages war was\r\na contention between the whole of the populations of the belligerent\r\nStates. In time of war every subject of one belligerent, whether an\r\narmed and fighting individual or not, whether man or woman, adult or\r\ninfant, could be killed or enslaved by the other belligerent at will.\r\nBut gradually a milder and more discriminative practice grew up, and\r\nnowadays the life and liberty of such private subjects of belligerents\r\nas do not directly or indirectly belong to their armed forces are safe,\r\nas is also, with certain exceptions, their private property.\r\n\r\nThis is a generally admitted fact. But opinions disagree as to the\r\ngeneral position of such private subjects in time of war. The majority\r\nof the European continental writers for the last three generations have\r\npropagated the doctrine that no relation of enmity exists between\r\nbelligerents and such private subjects, or between the private subjects\r\nof the respective belligerents. This doctrine goes back to Rousseau,\r\n_Contrat Social_, I. c. 4. In 1801, on the occasion of the opening of\r\nthe French Prize Court, the famous lawyer and statesman Portalis adopted\r\nRousseau's[63] doctrine by declaring that war is a relation between\r\nStates and not between individuals, and that consequently the subjects\r\nof the belligerents are only enemies as soldiers, not as citizens. And\r\nalthough this new doctrine did not, as Hall (§ 18) shows, spread at\r\nonce, it has since the second half of the nineteenth century been\r\nproclaimed on the European continent by the majority of writers. British\r\nand American-English writers, however, have never adopted this doctrine,\r\nbut have always maintained that the relation of enmity between the\r\nbelligerents extends also to their private citizens.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 63: See Lassudrie-Duchêne, _Jean Jacques Rousseau et le droit\r\ndes gens_ (1906).]\r\n\r\nI think, if the facts of war are taken into consideration without\r\nprejudice, there ought to be no doubt that the British and American view\r\nis correct.[64] It is impossible to sever the citizens from their State,\r\nand the outbreak of war between two States cannot but make their\r\ncitizens enemies. But the point is unworthy of dispute, because it is\r\nonly one of terms without any material consequences.[65] For, apart from\r\nthe terminology, the parties agree in substance upon the rules of the\r\nLaw of Nations regarding such private subjects as do not directly or\r\nindirectly belong to the armed forces.[66] Nobody doubts that such\r\nprivate individuals are safe as regards their life and liberty, provided\r\nthey behave peacefully and loyally; and that, with certain exceptions,\r\ntheir private property must not be touched. On the other hand, nobody\r\ndoubts that, according to a generally recognised custom of modern\r\nwarfare, the belligerent who has occupied a part or the whole of his\r\nopponent's territory, and who treats such private individuals leniently\r\naccording to the rules of International Law, may punish them for any\r\nhostile act, since they do not enjoy the privileges of members of armed\r\nforces. Although, on the one hand, International Law by no means\r\nforbids, and, as a law between States, is not competent to forbid,\r\nprivate individuals to take up arms against an enemy, it gives, on the\r\nother hand, the right to the enemy to treat hostilities committed by\r\nprivate[67] individuals as acts of illegitimate warfare. A belligerent\r\nis under a duty to respect the life and liberty of private enemy\r\nindividuals, but he can carry out this duty under the condition only\r\nthat these private individuals abstain from hostilities against himself.\r\nThrough military occupation in war such private individuals fall under\r\nthe authority[68] of the occupant, and he may therefore demand that they\r\ncomply with his orders regarding the safety of his forces. The position\r\nof private enemy individuals is made known to them through the\r\nproclamations which the commander-in-chief of an army occupying the\r\nterritory usually publishes. Thus General Sir Redvers Buller, when\r\nentering the territory of the South African Republic in 1900, published\r\nthe following proclamation:\r\n\r\n\"The troops of Queen Victoria are now passing through the Transvaal. Her\r\nMajesty does not make war on individuals, but is, on the contrary,\r\nanxious to spare them as far as may be possible the horrors of war. The\r\nquarrel England has is with the Government, not with the people, of the\r\nTransvaal. Provided they remain neutral, no attempt will be made to\r\ninterfere with persons living near the line of march; every possible\r\nprotection will be given them, and any of their property that it may be\r\nnecessary to take will be paid for. But, on the other hand, those who\r\nare thus allowed to remain near the line of march must respect and\r\nmaintain their neutrality, and the residents of any locality will be\r\nheld responsible, both in their persons and property, if any damage is\r\ndone to railway or telegraph, or any violence done to any member of the\r\nBritish forces in the vicinity of their home.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 64: See Boidin, pp. 32-44.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 65: But many continental writers constantly make use of\r\nRousseau's _dictum_ in order to defend untenable positions. See\r\nOppenheim, _Die Zukunft des Völkerrechts_ (1911), pp. 59-61.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 66: See Breton, _Les non-belligérants: Leurs devoirs, leurs\r\ndroits, et la question des otages_ (1904).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 67: See below, § 254.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 68: The first edition of this work was wrong in stating that\r\nthrough military occupation private enemy individuals fall under the\r\n_territorial supremacy_ of the occupant. Since military occupation by no\r\nmeans vests sovereignty in the occupant, but only actual authority, this\r\nauthority may not be called _territorial supremacy_.]\r\n\r\nIt must be emphasised that this position of private individuals of the\r\nhostile States renders it inevitable that commanders of armies which\r\nhave occupied hostile territory should consider and mark as criminals\r\nall such private individuals of the enemy as commit hostile acts,\r\nalthough such individuals may act from patriotic motives and may be\r\nhighly praised for their acts by their compatriots. The high-sounding\r\nand well-meant words of Baron Lambermont, one of the Belgian delegates\r\nat the Conference of Brussels of 1874--\"Il y a des choses qui se font à\r\nla guerre, qui se feront toujours, et que l'on doit bien accepter. Mais\r\nil s'agit ici de les convertir en lois, en prescriptions positives et\r\ninternationales. Si les citoyens doivent être conduits au supplice pour\r\navoir tenté de défendre leur pays au péril de leur vie, il ne faut pas\r\nqu'ils trouvent inscrits sur le poteau au pied duquel ils seront fusilés\r\nl'article d'un traité signé par leur propre gouvernement qui d'avance\r\nles condamnait à mort\"--have no _raison d'être_ in face of the fact that\r\naccording to a generally recognised customary rule of International Law\r\nhostile acts on the part of private individuals are not acts of\r\nlegitimate warfare, and the offenders may be treated and punished as\r\nwar-criminals. Even those writers[69] who object to the term \"criminals\"\r\ndo not deny that such hostile acts by private individuals, in\r\ncontradistinction to hostile acts by members of the armed forces, may be\r\nseverely punished. The controversy whether or not such acts may be\r\nstyled \"crimes\" is again only one of terminology; materially the rule is\r\nnot at all controverted.[70]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 69: See, for instance, Hall, § 18, p. 74, and Westlake,\r\n_Chapters_, p. 262.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 70: It is of value to quote articles 20-26 of the\r\n_Instructions for the Government of Armies of the United States in the\r\nField_, which the War Department of the United States published in 1863\r\nduring the War of Secession with the Southern member-States:\r\n\r\n(20) \"Public war is a state of armed hostility between sovereign nations\r\nor governments. It is a law and requisite of civil existence that men\r\nlive in political, continuous societies, forming organised units, called\r\nStates or nations, whose constituents bear, enjoy, and suffer, advance\r\nand retrograde together, in peace and in war.\"\r\n\r\n(21) \"The citizen or native of a hostile country is thus an enemy as one\r\nof the constituents of the hostile State or nation, and as such is\r\nsubjected to the hardships of war.\"\r\n\r\n(22) \"Nevertheless, as civilisation has advanced during the last\r\ncenturies, so has likewise advanced, especially in war on land, the\r\ndistinction between the private individual belonging to a hostile\r\ncountry and the hostile country itself, with its men in arms. The\r\nprinciple has been more and more acknowledged that the unarmed citizen\r\nis to be spared in person, property, and honour as much as the\r\nexigencies of war will admit.\"\r\n\r\n(23) \"Private citizens are no longer murdered, enslaved, or carried off\r\nto distant parts, and the inoffensive individual is as little disturbed\r\nin his private relations as the commander of the hostile troops can\r\nafford to grant in the overruling demands of a vigorous war.\"\r\n\r\n(24) \"The almost universal rule in remote times was ... that the private\r\nindividual of the hostile country is destined to suffer every privation\r\nof liberty and protection and every disruption of family ties.\r\nProtection was ... the exception.\"\r\n\r\n(25) \"In modern regular wars ... protection of the inoffensive citizens\r\nof the hostile country is the rule; privation and disturbance of private\r\nrelations are the exceptions.\"\r\n\r\n(26) \"Commanding generals may cause the magistrates and civil officers\r\nof the hostile country to take the oath of temporary allegiance or an\r\noath of fidelity to their own victorious Government or rulers, and they\r\nmay expel every one who declines to do so. But, whether they do so or\r\nnot, the people and their civil officers owe strict obedience to them as\r\nlong as they hold sway over the district or country, at the peril of\r\ntheir lives.\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: War a contention between States for the purpose of\r\noverpowering each other.]\r\n\r\n§ 58. The last, and not the least important, characteristic of war is\r\nits purpose. It is a contention between States for the purpose of\r\noverpowering each other. This purpose of war is not to be confounded\r\nwith the ends[71] of war, for, whatever the ends of war may be, they can\r\nonly be realised by one belligerent overpowering the other. Such a\r\ndefeat as compels the vanquished to comply with any demand the victor\r\nmay choose to make is the purpose of war. Therefore war calls into\r\nexistence the display of the greatest possible power and force on the\r\npart of the belligerents, rouses the passion of the nations in conflict\r\nto the highest possible degree, and endangers the welfare, the honour,\r\nand eventually the very existence of both belligerents. Nobody can\r\npredict with certainty the result of a war however insignificant one\r\nside may seem to be. Every war is a risk and a venture. Every State\r\nwhich goes to war knows beforehand what is at stake, and it would never\r\ngo to war were it not for its firm, though very often illusory,\r\nconviction of its superiority in strength over its opponent. Victory is\r\nnecessary in order to overpower the enemy; and it is this necessity\r\nwhich justifies all the indescribable horrors of war, the enormous\r\nsacrifice of human life and health, and the unavoidable destruction of\r\nproperty and devastation of territory. Apart from special restrictions\r\nimposed by the Law of Nations upon belligerents, all kinds and all\r\ndegrees of force may be, and eventually must be, made use of in war in\r\nthe interest and under the compulsion of its purpose, and in spite of\r\ntheir cruelty and the utter misery they entail. As war is a struggle for\r\nexistence between States, no amount of individual suffering and misery\r\ncan be regarded; the national existence and independence of the\r\nstruggling State is a higher consideration than any individual\r\nwell-being.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 71: See below, § 66.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Civil War.]\r\n\r\n§ 59. The characteristics of war as developed above must help to decide\r\nthe question whether so-called civil wars are war in the technical\r\nmeaning of the term. It has already been stated above (in § 56) that an\r\narmed contention between member-States of a Federal State and the latter\r\nand between a suzerain and its vassal ought to be considered as war\r\nbecause both parties are real States, although the Federal State as well\r\nas the suzerain may correctly designate it as a rebellion. Such armed\r\ncontentions may be called civil wars in a wider sense of the term. In\r\nthe proper sense of the term a civil war exists when two opposing\r\nparties within a State have recourse to arms for the purpose of\r\nobtaining power in the State, or when a large portion of the population\r\nof a State rises in arms against the legitimate Government. As war is an\r\narmed contention between _States_, such a civil war need not be from the\r\nbeginning, nor become at all, war in the technical sense of the term.\r\nBut it may become war through the recognition of each of the contending\r\nparties or of the insurgents as the case may be, as a belligerent\r\nPower.[72] Through this recognition a body of individuals receives an\r\ninternational position in so far as it is for some parts and in some\r\npoints treated as though it were a subject[73] of International Law.\r\nSuch recognition may be granted by the very State within the boundaries\r\nof which the civil war broke out, and then other States will in most\r\ncases, although they need not, likewise recognise a state of war as\r\nexisting and bear the duties of neutrality. But it may happen that other\r\nStates recognise insurgents as a belligerent Power before the State on\r\nwhose territory the insurrection broke out so recognises them. In such\r\ncase the insurrection is war in the eyes of these other States, but not\r\nin the eyes of the legitimate Government.[74] Be that as it may, it must\r\nbe specially observed that, although a civil war becomes war in the\r\ntechnical sense of the term by recognition, this recognition has a\r\nlasting effect only when the insurgents succeed in getting their\r\nindependence established through the defeat of the legitimate Government\r\nand a consequent treaty of peace which recognises their independence.\r\nNothing, however, prevents the State concerned, after the defeat of the\r\ninsurgents and reconquest of the territory which they had occupied, from\r\ntreating them as rebels according to the Criminal Law of the land, for\r\nthe character of a belligerent Power received through recognition is\r\nlost _ipso facto_ by their defeat and the re-occupation by the\r\nlegitimate Government of the territory occupied by them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 72: See below, §§ 76 and 298.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 73: See above, vol. I. § 63.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 74: See below, § 298.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Guerilla War.]\r\n\r\n§ 60. The characteristics of war as developed above are also decisive\r\nfor the answer to the question whether so-called guerilla war is real\r\nwar in the technical sense of the term. Such guerilla war must not be\r\nconfounded with guerilla tactics during a war. It happens during war\r\nthat the commanders send small bodies of soldiers wearing their uniform\r\nto the rear of the enemy for the purpose of destroying bridges and\r\nrailways, cutting off communications and supplies, attacking convoys,\r\nintercepting despatches, and the like. This is in every way legal, and\r\nthe members of such bodies, when captured, enjoy the treatment due to\r\nenemy soldiers. It happens, further, that hitherto private individuals\r\nwho did not take part in the armed contention take up arms and devote\r\nthemselves mainly to similar tactics. According to the former rules of\r\nInternational Law such individuals, when captured, under no condition\r\nenjoyed the treatment due to enemy soldiers, but could be treated as\r\ncriminals and punished with death. According to article 1 of the\r\nRegulations concerning war on land adopted by the Hague Conferences of\r\n1899 and 1907 such guerilla fighters enjoy the treatment of soldiers\r\nunder the four conditions that they (1) do not act individually, but\r\nform a body commanded by a person responsible for his subordinates, (2)\r\nhave a fixed distinctive emblem recognisable at a distance, (3) carry\r\narms openly, and (4) conduct their operations in accordance with the\r\nlaws of war.[75]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 75: See also article 2 of the Hague Regulations.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, one speaks of guerilla war or petty war when, after\r\nthe defeat and the capture of the main part of the enemy forces, the\r\noccupation of the enemy territory, and the downfall of the enemy\r\nGovernment, the routed remnants of the defeated army carry on the\r\ncontention by mere guerilla tactics. Although hopeless of success in the\r\nend, such petty war can go on for a long time thus preventing the\r\nestablishment of a state of peace in spite of the fact that regular war\r\nis over and the task of the army of occupation is no longer regular\r\nwarfare. Now the question whether such guerilla war is real war in the\r\nstrict sense of the term in International Law must, I think, be answered\r\nin the negative, for two reasons. First, there are no longer the forces\r\nof two States in the field, because the defeated belligerent State has\r\nceased to exist through the military occupation of its territory, the\r\ndownfall of its established Government, the capture of the main part and\r\nthe routing of the remnant of its forces. And, secondly, there is no\r\nlonger in progress a contention between armed forces. For although the\r\nguerilla bands are still fighting when attacked, or when attacking small\r\nbodies of enemy soldiers, they try to avoid a pitched battle, and\r\ncontent themselves with the constant harassing of the victorious army,\r\nthe destroying of bridges and railways, cutting off communications and\r\nsupplies, attacking convoys, and the like, always in the hope that some\r\nevent or events may occur which will induce the victorious army to\r\nwithdraw from the conquered territory. But if guerilla war is not real\r\nwar, it is obvious that in strict law the victor need no longer treat\r\nthe guerilla bands as a belligerent Power and the captured members of\r\nthose bands as soldiers. It is, however, not advisable that the victor\r\nshould cease such treatment as long as those bands are under responsible\r\ncommanders and observe themselves the laws and usages of war. For I can\r\nsee no advantage or reason why, although in strict law it could be done,\r\nthose bands should be treated as criminals. Such treatment would only\r\ncall for acts of revenge on their part, without in the least\r\naccelerating the pacification of the country. And it is, after all, to\r\nbe taken into consideration that those bands act not out of criminal but\r\npatriotic motives. With patience and firmness the victor will succeed in\r\npacifying these bands without recourse to methods of harshness.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nCAUSES, KINDS, AND ENDS OF WAR\r\n\r\n  Grotius, I. c. 3; II. c. 1; III. c. 3--Pufendorf, VIII. c. 6, §\r\n  9--Vattel, III. §§ 2, 5, 24-50, 183-187--Lorimer, II. pp.\r\n  29-48--Phillimore, III. §§ 33-48--Twiss, II. §§ 26-30--Halleck, I.\r\n  pp. 488-519--Taylor, §§ 452-454--Wheaton, §§ 295-296--Bluntschli, §§\r\n  515-521--Heffter, § 113--Lueder in Holtzendorff, IV. pp.\r\n  221-236--Klüber, §§ 41, 235, 237--G.

Whatever may be the cause of a war that has broken out, and\r\nwhether or no the cause be a so-called just cause, the same rules of\r\nInternational Law are valid as to what must not be done, may be done,\r\nand must be done by the belligerents themselves in making war against\r\neach other, and as between the belligerents and neutral States. This\r\nbeing the case, the question as to the causes of war is of minor\r\nimportance for the Law of Nations, although not for international\r\nethics. The matter need not be discussed at all in a treatise on\r\nInternational Law were it not for the fact that many writers maintain\r\nthat there are rules of International Law in existence which determine\r\nand define just causes of war. It must, however, be emphasised that this\r\nis by no means the case. All such rules laid down by writers on\r\nInternational Law as recognise certain causes as just and others as\r\nunjust are rules of writers, but not rules of International Law based on\r\ninternational custom or international treaties.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Causes of War.]\r\n\r\n§ 62. The causes of war are innumerable. They are involved in the fact\r\nthat the development of mankind is indissolubly connected with the\r\nnational development of States. The millions of individuals who as a\r\nbody are called mankind do not face one another individually and\r\nseverally, but in groups as races, nations, and States. With the welfare\r\nof the races, nations, and States to which they belong the welfare of\r\nindividuals is more or less identified. And it is the development of\r\nraces, nations, and States that carries with it the causes of war. A\r\nconstant increase of population must in the end force upon a State the\r\nnecessity of acquiring more territory, and if such territory cannot be\r\nacquired by peaceable means, acquisition by conquest alone remains. At\r\ncertain periods of history the principle of nationality and the desire\r\nfor national unity gain such a power over the hearts and minds of the\r\nindividuals belonging to the same race or nation, but living within the\r\nboundaries of several different States, that wars break out for the\r\ncause of national unity and independence. And jealous rivalry between\r\ntwo or more States, the awakening of national ambition, the craving for\r\nrich colonies, the desire of a land-locked State for a sea coast, the\r\nendeavour of a hitherto minor State to become a world-Power, the\r\nambition of dynasties or of great politicians to extend and enlarge\r\ntheir influence beyond the boundaries of their own State, and\r\ninnumerable other factors, have been at work ever since history was\r\nfirst recorded in creating causes of war, and these factors likewise\r\nplay their part in our own times. Although one must hope that the time\r\nwill come when war will entirely disappear, there is no possibility of\r\nseeing this hope realised in the near future. The first necessities of\r\nthe disappearance of war are that the surface of the earth should be\r\nshared between States of the same standard of civilisation, and that the\r\nmoral ideas of the governing classes in all the States of the world\r\nshould undergo such an alteration and progressive development as would\r\ncreate the conviction that decisions of international courts of justice\r\nand awards of arbitrators are alone adequate means for the settlement of\r\ninternational disputes and international political aims. So long as\r\nthese first necessities are not realised, war will as heretofore remain\r\nthe _ultima ratio_ of international politics.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Just Causes of War.]\r\n\r\n§ 63. However this may be, it often depends largely upon the standpoint\r\nfrom which they are viewed whether or no causes of war are to be called\r\njust causes. A war may be just or unjust from the standpoint of both\r\nbelligerents, or just from the standpoint of one and utterly unjust from\r\nthe standpoint of the other. The assertion that whereas all wars waged\r\nfor political causes are unjust, all wars waged for international\r\ndelinquencies are just, if there be no other way of getting reparation\r\nand satisfaction, is certainly incorrect because too sweeping. The evils\r\nof war are so great that, even when caused by an international\r\ndelinquency,[76] war cannot be justified if the delinquency be\r\ncomparatively unimportant and trifling. And, on the other hand, under\r\ncertain circumstances and conditions many political causes of war may\r\ncorrectly be called just causes. Only such individuals as lack insight\r\ninto history and human nature can, for instance, defend the opinion that\r\na war is unjust which has been caused by the desire for national unity\r\nor by the desire to maintain the balance of power which under the\r\npresent conditions and circumstances is the basis of all International\r\nLaw. Necessity for a war implies its justification, whatever may be the\r\ncause. In the past many wars have undoubtedly been waged which were\r\nunjust from whatever standpoint they may be viewed. Yet the number of\r\nwars diminishes gradually every year, and the majority of the European\r\nwars since the downfall of Napoleon I. were wars that were, from the\r\nstandpoint of at any rate one of the belligerents, necessary and\r\ntherefore just wars.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 76: See above, vol. I. §§ 151-156.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Causes in contradistinction to Pretexts for War.]\r\n\r\n§ 64. Be that as it may, causes of war must not be confounded with\r\npretexts for war. A State which makes war against another will never\r\nconfess that there is no just cause for war, and it will therefore, when\r\nit has made up its mind to make war for political reasons, always look\r\nout for a so-called just cause. Thus frequently the apparent reason of a\r\nwar is only a pretext behind which the real cause is concealed. If two\r\nStates are convinced that war between them is inevitable, and if\r\nconsequently they face each other armed to the teeth, they will find at\r\nthe suitable time many a so-called just cause plausible and calculated\r\nto serve as a pretext for the outbreak of the war which was planned and\r\nresolved upon long ago. The skill of politics and diplomacy are nowhere\r\nmore needed than on the occasion of a State's conviction that it must go\r\nto war for one reason or another. Public opinion at home and abroad is\r\noften not ripe to appreciate the reason and not prepared for the scheme\r\nof the leading politicians, whose task it is to realise their plans with\r\nthe aid of pretexts which appear as the cause of war, whereas the real\r\ncause does not become apparent for some time.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Different kinds of War.]\r\n\r\n§ 65. Such writers on International Law as lay great stress upon the\r\ncauses of war in general and upon the distinction between just causes\r\nand others, also lay great stress upon the distinction between different\r\nkinds of war. But as the rules of the Law of Nations are the same[77]\r\nfor the different kinds of war that may be distinguished, this\r\ndistinction is in most cases of no importance. Apart from that, there is\r\nno unanimity respecting the kinds of war, and it is apparent that, just\r\nas the causes of war are innumerable, so innumerable kinds of war can be\r\ndistinguished. Thus one speaks of offensive and defensive, or religious,\r\npolitical, dynastic, national, civil wars; of wars of unity,\r\nindependence, conquest, intervention, revenge, and of many other kinds.\r\nAs the very name which each different kind of war bears always explains\r\nits character no further details are necessary respecting kinds of war.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 77: See above, § 61.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ends of War.]\r\n\r\n§ 66. The cause or causes of a war determine at its inception the ends\r\nof such war. The ends of war must not be confounded with the purpose of\r\nwar.[78] Whereas the purpose of war is always the same--namely, the\r\noverpowering and utter defeat of the opponent--the ends of war may be\r\ndifferent in each case. Ends of war are those objects for the\r\nrealisation of which a war is made.[79] In the beginning of the war its\r\nends are determined by its cause or causes, as already said. But these\r\nends may undergo alteration, or at least modification, with the progress\r\nand development of the war. No moral or legal duty exists for a\r\nbelligerent to stop the war when his opponent is ready to concede the\r\nobject for which war was made. If war has once broken out the very\r\nnational existence of the belligerents is more or less at stake. The\r\nrisk the belligerents run, the exertion they make, the blood and wealth\r\nthey sacrifice, the reputation they gain or lose through the changing\r\nfortune and chances of war--all these and many other factors work or may\r\nwork together to influence the ends of a war so that eventually there is\r\nscarcely any longer a relation between them and the causes of the war.\r\nIf war really were, as some writers maintain,[80] the legal remedy of\r\nself-help to obtain satisfaction for a wrong sustained from another\r\nState, no such alteration of the ends of war could take place without at\r\nonce setting in the wrong such belligerent as changes the ends for which\r\nthe war was initiated. But history shows that nothing of the kind is\r\nreally the case, and the existing rules of International Law by no means\r\nforbid such alteration or modification of the ends of a war. This\r\nalteration or modification of the ends is the result of an alteration or\r\nmodification of circumstances created during the progress of war through\r\nthe factors previously mentioned; it could not be otherwise, and there\r\nis no moral, legal, or political reason why it should be otherwise. And\r\nthe natural jealousy between the members of the Family of Nations, their\r\nconflicting interests in many points, and the necessity of a balance of\r\npower, are factors of sufficient strength to check the political dangers\r\nwhich such alteration of the ends of a war may eventually involve.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 78: Ends of war must likewise not be confounded with aims of\r\nland and sea warfare; see below, §§ 103 and 173.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 79: See Bluntschli, § 536; Lueder in Holtzendorff, IV. p. 364;\r\nRivier, II. p. 219.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 80: See above, § 54.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTHE LAWS OF WAR\r\n\r\n  Hall, § 17--Westlake, _Chapters_, pp. 232-235--Maine, pp.\r\n  122-159--Phillimore, III. § 50--Taylor, § 470--Walker, _History_,\r\n  I. §§ 106-108--Heffter, § 119--Lueder in Holtzendorff, IV. pp.\r\n  253-333--Ullmann, §§ 167 and 170--Bonfils, Nos.\r\n  1006-1013--Despagnet, Nos. 508-510--Pradier-Fodéré, VIII.

Laws of War are the rules of the Law of Nations respecting\r\nwarfare. The roots of the present Laws of War are to be traced back to\r\npractices of belligerents which arose and grew gradually during the\r\nlatter part of the Middle Ages. The unsparing cruelty of the war\r\npractices during the greater part of the Middle Ages began gradually to\r\nbe modified through the influence of Christianity and chivalry. And\r\nalthough these practices were cruel enough during the fifteenth,\r\nsixteenth, and seventeenth centuries, they were mild compared with those\r\nof still earlier times. Decided progress was made during the eighteenth,\r\nand again during the nineteenth century, after the close of the\r\nNapoleonic wars, especially in the years from 1850 to 1900. The laws of\r\nwar evolved in this way: isolated milder practices became by-and-by\r\nusages, so-called _usus in bello_, manner of warfare, _Kriegs-Manier_,\r\nand these usages through custom and treaties turned into legal rules.\r\nAnd this evolution is constantly going on, for, besides the recognised\r\nLaws of War, there are usages in existence which have a tendency to\r\nbecome gradually legal rules of warfare. The whole growth of the laws\r\nand usages of war is determined by three principles. There is, first,\r\nthe principle that a belligerent should be justified in applying any\r\namount and any kind of force which is necessary for the realisation of\r\nthe purpose of war--namely, the overpowering of the opponent. There is,\r\nsecondly, the principle of humanity at work, which says that all such\r\nkinds and degrees of violence as are not necessary for the overpowering\r\nof the opponent should not be permitted to a belligerent. And, thirdly\r\nand lastly, there is at work the principle of chivalry which arose in\r\nthe Middle Ages and introduced a certain amount of fairness in offence\r\nand defence, and a certain mutual respect. And, in contradistinction to\r\nthe savage cruelty of former times, belligerents have in modern times\r\ncome to the conviction that the realisation of the purpose of war is in\r\nno way hampered by indulgence shown to the wounded, the prisoners, and\r\nthe private individuals who do not take part in the fighting. Thus the\r\ninfluence of the principle of humanity has been and is still enormous\r\nupon the practice of warfare. And the methods of warfare, although by\r\nthe nature of war to a certain degree cruel and unsparing, become less\r\ncruel and more humane every day. But it must be emphasised that the\r\nwhole evolution of the laws and usages of war could not have taken place\r\nbut for the institution of standing armies, which dates from the\r\nfifteenth century. The humanising of the practices of war would have\r\nbeen impossible without the discipline of standing armies; and the\r\nimportant distinction between members of armed forces and private\r\nindividuals could not have arisen without the existence of standing\r\narmies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The latest Development of the Laws of War.]\r\n\r\n§ 68. The latest and the most important development of the Laws of War\r\nwas produced through general treaties concluded between the majority of\r\nStates since the beginning of the second part of the nineteenth century.\r\nThe following are the treaties concerned:--\r\n\r\n(1) The Declaration of Paris of April 16, 1856, respecting warfare on\r\nsea. It abolishes privateering, recognises the principles that the\r\nneutral flag covers enemy goods and that neutral goods under an enemy\r\nflag cannot be seized, and enacts the rule that a blockade in order to\r\nbe binding must be effective. The Declaration is signed by seven States,\r\nbut eighteen others acceded in course of time.\r\n\r\n(2) The Geneva Convention of August 22, 1864, for the amelioration of\r\nthe condition of wounded soldiers in armies in the field, which\r\noriginally was signed by only nine States, but to which in course of\r\ntime all the civilised States--except Costa-Rica, Lichtenstein, and\r\nMonaco!--have acceded. A treaty containing a number of additional\r\narticles to the Convention was signed at Geneva on October 20, 1868, but\r\nwas never ratified. A new Geneva Convention was signed on July 6, 1906,\r\nby thirty-five States, and several others have already acceded. There is\r\nno doubt that the whole civilised world will soon be a party to this new\r\nGeneva Convention. The principles of the Geneva Convention were adapted\r\nto maritime warfare by Conventions (see below, No. 8) of the First and\r\nSecond Hague Peace Conferences.\r\n\r\n(3) The Declaration of St. Petersburg of December 11, 1868, respecting\r\nthe prohibition of the use in war of projectiles under 400 grammes (14\r\nounces) which are either explosive or charged with inflammable\r\nsubstances. It is signed by seventeen States.\r\n\r\n(4) The Convention enacting \"Regulations respecting the Laws of War on\r\nLand,\" agreed upon at the First Peace Conference of 1899.\r\n\r\nThe history of this Convention may be traced back to the _Instructions\r\nfor the Government of Armies of the United States in the Field_ which\r\nthe United States published on April 14, 1863, during the War of\r\nSecession. These instructions, which were drafted by Professor Francis\r\nLieber, of the Columbia College of New York, represent the first\r\nendeavour to codify the Laws of War, and they are even nowadays of great\r\nvalue and importance. In 1874 an International Conference, invited by\r\nthe Emperor Alexander II. of Russia, met at Brussels for the purpose of\r\ndiscussing a draft code of the Laws of War on Land as prepared by\r\nRussia. The body of the articles agreed upon at this Conference, and\r\nknown as the \"Brussels Declarations,\" have, however, never become law,\r\nas ratification was never given by the Powers. But the Brussels\r\nDeclarations were made the basis of deliberations on the part of the\r\nInstitute of International Law, which at its meeting at Oxford in 1880\r\nadopted a Manual[81] of the Laws of War consisting of a body of 86 rules\r\nunder the title _Les Lois de la Guerre sur Terre_, and a copy of this\r\ndraft code was sent to all the Governments of Europe and America. It\r\nwas, however, not until the Hague Peace Conference of 1899 that the\r\nPowers reassembled to discuss again the codification of the Laws of War.\r\nAt this Conference the Brussels Declarations were taken as the basis of\r\nthe deliberations; but although the bulk of its articles was taken over,\r\nseveral important modifications were introduced in the Convention, which\r\nwas finally agreed upon and ratified, only a few Powers abstaining from\r\nratification.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 81: See _Annuaire_, V. pp. 157-174.]\r\n\r\nThe Second Peace Conference of 1907 has revised this Convention, and its\r\nplace is now taken by Convention IV. of the Second Peace Conference. The\r\nConvention,[82] as the preamble expressly states, does not aim at\r\ngiving a complete code of the Laws of War on Land, and cases beyond its\r\nscope still remain the subject of customary rules and usages. Further,\r\nit does not create universal International Law, as article 2 of the\r\nConvention expressly stipulates that the Regulations shall be binding\r\nupon the contracting Powers only in case of war between two or more of\r\nthem, and shall cease to be binding in case a non-contracting Power\r\ntakes part in the war. But, in spite of this express stipulation, there\r\ncan be no doubt that in time the Regulations will become universal\r\nInternational Law. For all the Powers represented at the Second Peace\r\nConference signed the Convention, except China, Spain, and Nicaragua,\r\nalthough some States made certain reservations. Nicaragua has since\r\nacceded, and it is certain that the outstanding States will in time also\r\naccede.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 82: For brevity's sake the Hague Convention enacting\r\nRegulations regarding the laws and customs of war on land will be\r\nreferred to in the following pages as the _Hague Regulations_. It is,\r\nhowever, of importance to observe that the Hague Regulations, although\r\nthey are intended to be binding upon the belligerents, are only the\r\nbasis upon which the signatory Powers have to frame instructions for\r\ntheir forces. Article 1 declares: \"The high contracting parties shall\r\nissue instructions to their armed land forces, which shall be in\r\nconformity with the Regulations respecting the Laws of War on Land\r\nannexed to the present Convention.\" The British War Office, therefore,\r\npublished in 1912, a guide, _Land Warfare: an Exposition of the Laws and\r\nUsages of War on Land for the Guidance of Officers of His Majesty's\r\nArmy_, written by order of His Majesty's Secretary of War by Colonel\r\nEdmonds and Professor Oppenheim, in which the Hague Regulations are\r\nsystematically set out; their full text is published in Appendix 6 of\r\nthe guide. But it should be mentioned that the British War Office had\r\nalready in 1903 published a manual, drafted with great precision and\r\nclearness by Professor Holland, for the information of the British\r\nforces, comprising \"The Laws and Customs of War on Land, as defined by\r\nthe Hague Convention of 1899.\" See also Holland, _The Laws of War on\r\nLand (Written and Unwritten)_, Oxford, 1908.]\r\n\r\n(5) The Declaration concerning expanding (dumdum) bullets; see below, §\r\n112.\r\n\r\n(6) The Declaration concerning projectiles and explosives launched from\r\nballoons; see below, § 114.\r\n\r\n(7) The Declaration concerning projectiles diffusing asphyxiating or\r\ndeleterious gases; see below, § 113.\r\n\r\n(8) The Convention for the adaptation to sea warfare of the principles\r\nof the Geneva Convention, produced by the First and revised by the\r\nSecond Peace Conference.\r\n\r\n(9) The Convention of 1907 concerning the opening of hostilities (Second\r\nPeace Conference).\r\n\r\n(10) The Convention of 1907 concerning the status of enemy merchantmen\r\nat the outbreak of hostilities (Second Peace Conference).\r\n\r\n(11) The Convention of 1907 concerning the conversion of merchantmen\r\ninto men-of-war (Second Peace Conference).\r\n\r\n(12) The Convention of 1907 concerning the laying of automatic submarine\r\ncontact mines (Second Peace Conference).\r\n\r\n(13) The Convention of 1907 concerning bombardment by naval forces in\r\ntime of war (Second Peace Conference).\r\n\r\n(14) The Convention of 1907 concerning certain restrictions on the\r\nexercise of the right of capture in maritime war (Second Peace\r\nConference).\r\n\r\n(15) The two Conventions of 1907 concerning the rights and duties of\r\nneutral Powers and persons in land warfare and in sea warfare (Second\r\nPeace Conference).\r\n\r\n(16) The Declaration of London of February 26, 1909, concerning the Laws\r\nof Naval War, which was signed at the Conference of London by Great\r\nBritain, Germany, the United States of America, Austria-Hungary, Spain,\r\nFrance, Italy, Japan, Holland, and Russia, but is not yet ratified. This\r\nDeclaration enacts rules concerning blockade, contraband, unneutral\r\nservice, destruction of neutral prizes, transfer of vessels to a neutral\r\nflag, enemy character, convoy, and resistance to search.[83]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 83: The United States of America (see above, vol. I. § 32),\r\npublished on June 27, 1900, a body of rules for the use of her navy\r\nunder the title _The Laws and Usages of War on Sea_--the so-called\r\n\"United States Naval War Code.\" This code, although withdrawn on\r\nFebruary 4, 1904, will undoubtedly be the starting-point of a movement\r\nfor a Naval War Code to be generally agreed upon by the Powers. See\r\nbelow, § 179.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Binding force of the Laws of War.]\r\n\r\n§ 69. As soon as usages of warfare have by custom or treaty evolved into\r\nlaws of war, they are binding upon belligerents under all circumstances\r\nand conditions, except in the case of reprisals[84] as retaliation\r\nagainst a belligerent for illegitimate acts of warfare by the members of\r\nhis armed forces or his other subjects. In accordance with the German\r\nproverb, _Kriegsraeson geht vor Kriegsmanier_ (_necessity in war\r\noverrules the manner of warfare_), many German authors[85] and the\r\nSwiss-Belgian Rivier[86] maintain that the laws of war lose their\r\nbinding force in case of extreme necessity. Such case of extreme\r\nnecessity is said to have arisen when violation of the laws of war alone\r\noffers either a means of escape from extreme danger or the realisation\r\nof the purpose of war--namely, the overpowering of the opponent. This\r\nalleged exception to the binding force of the Laws of War, is, however,\r\nnot at all generally accepted by German writers, for instance,\r\nBluntschli does not mention it. English, American, French, and Italian\r\nwriters do not, so far as I am aware, acknowledge it. The protest of\r\nWestlake,[87] therefore, against such an exception is the more\r\njustified, as a great danger would be involved by its admission.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 84: See below, § 248.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 85: See, for instance, Lueder in Holtzendorff, IV. pp.\r\n254-257; Ullmann, § 170; Meurer, II. pp. 7-15. Liszt, who in former\r\neditions agreed with these writers, deserts their ranks in the sixth\r\nedition (§ 24, IV. 3), and correctly takes the other side. See also Nys,\r\nIII. p. 202, and Holland, _War_, § 2, where the older literature is\r\nquoted.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 86: See Rivier, II. p. 242.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 87: See Westlake, II. pp. 115-117, and Westlake, _Chapters_,\r\np. 238.]\r\n\r\nThe proverb dates very far back in the history of warfare. It originated\r\nand found recognition in those times when warfare was not regulated by\r\nlaws of war--that is universally binding customs and international\r\ntreaties, but only by usages (_Manier, i.e. Brauch_), and it says that\r\nnecessity in war overrules usages of warfare. In our days, however,\r\nwarfare is no longer regulated by usages only, but to a greater extent\r\nby laws, firm rules recognised either by international treaties or by\r\nuniversal custom.[88] These conventional and customary rules cannot be\r\noverruled by necessity, unless they are framed in such a way as not to\r\napply to a case of necessity in self-preservation. Thus, for instance,\r\nthe rules that poisoned arms and poison are forbidden, and that it is\r\nnot allowed treacherously to kill or wound individuals belonging to the\r\nhostile army, do not lose their binding force even if escape from\r\nextreme danger or the realisation of the purpose of war would result\r\nfrom an act of this kind. Article 22 of the Hague Rules stipulates\r\ndistinctly that the right of belligerents to adopt means of injuring the\r\nenemy is not unlimited, and this rule does not lose its binding force in\r\na case of necessity. What may be ignored in case of military necessity\r\nare not the laws of war, but only the usages of war. _Kriegsraeson geht\r\nvor Kriegsmanier_, but not _vor Kriegsrecht_!\r\n\r\n[Footnote 88: Concerning the distinction between usage and custom, see\r\nabove, vol. I. § 17.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nTHE REGION OF WAR\r\n\r\n  Taylor, §§ 471 and 498--Heffter, § 118--Lueder in Holtzendorff,\r\n  IV. pp. 362-364--Klüber, § 242--Liszt, § 40, I.--Ullmann, §\r\n  174--Pradier-Fodéré, VI.

Region of war is that part of the surface of the earth in which\r\nthe belligerents may prepare and execute hostilities against each other.\r\nIn this meaning region of war ought[89] to be distinguished from theatre\r\nof war. The latter is that part of a territory or the Open Sea on which\r\nhostilities actually take place. Legally no part of the earth which is\r\nnot region of war may be made the theatre of war, but not every section\r\nof the whole region of war is necessarily theatre of war. Thus, in the\r\nwar between Great Britain and the two South African Republics the whole\r\nof the territory of the British Empire and the Open Sea, as well as the\r\nterritory of the Republics, was the region of war, but the theatre of\r\nwar was in South Africa only. On the other hand, in a war between Great\r\nBritain and another great naval Power it might well happen that the\r\nregion of war is in many of its sections made the theatre of war.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 89: This distinction, although of considerable importance,\r\ndoes not appear to have been made by any other publicist.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Particular Region of every War.]\r\n\r\n§ 71. The region of war depends upon the belligerents. For this reason\r\nevery war has its particular region, so far at any rate as territorial\r\nregion is concerned. For besides the Open Sea[90] and all such\r\nterritories as are as yet not occupied by any State, which are always\r\nwithin the region of war, the particular region of every war is the\r\nwhole of the territories and territorial waters of the belligerents. It\r\nmust, however, be specially observed that any part of the globe which is\r\npermanently neutralised,[91] is always exempt from the region of war.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 90: See above, vol. I. § 256.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 91: See below, § 72.]\r\n\r\nSince colonies are a part of the territory of the mother country, they\r\nfall within the region of war in the case of a war between the mother\r\ncountry and another State, whatever their position may be within the\r\ncolonial empire they belong to. Thus in a war between Great Britain and\r\nFrance the whole of Australia, of Canada, of India, and so on, would be\r\nincluded with the British Islands as region of war. And, further, as\r\nStates under the suzerainty of another State are internationally in\r\nseveral respects considered to be a portion of the latter's\r\nterritory,[92] they fall within the region of war in case of war between\r\nthe suzerain and another Power. Again, such parts of the territory of a\r\nState as are under the _condominium_ or under the administration of\r\nanother State[93] fall within the region of war in case of war between\r\none of the _condomini_ and another Power and in case of war between the\r\nadministrating State and another State. Thus, in a war between Great\r\nBritain and another Power, Cyprus would fall within the region of war;\r\nand the Soudan, which is in the _condominium_ of England and Egypt,\r\nwould likewise do so. On the other hand, Cyprus would not fall within\r\nthe region of war in the case of war between Turkey and another Power,\r\nGreat Britain excepted.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 92: See above, vol. I. §§ 91 and 169.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 93: See above, vol. I. § 171.]\r\n\r\nAlthough as a rule the territories of both belligerents, together with\r\nthe Open Sea, fall within the region of war, and neutral territories do\r\nnot, exceptions to the rule may occur:--\r\n\r\n(1) A belligerent can deliberately treat certain territories which\r\nlegally fall within the region of war, as well as parts of the Open Sea,\r\nas though they were not parts of the region of war, provided that such\r\nterritories on their part fulfil the duties incumbent upon neutrals.\r\nThus during the Turco-Italian War in 1911 and 1912, Italy treated Crete\r\nand Egypt as though they were not parts of the region of war.[94]\r\n\r\n(2) Cases are possible in which a part or the whole of the territory of\r\na neutral State falls within the region of war. These cases arise in\r\nwars in which such neutral territories are the very objects of the war,\r\nas Korea, which was at that time an independent State, and the Chinese\r\nprovince of Manchuria[95] were in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904 and\r\n1905. Such a case may also occur if an army of one of the belligerents\r\ncrosses the frontier of a neutral State, but is not at once disarmed\r\nand interned, and is, therefore, able at any moment to recross the\r\nfrontier and attack the other belligerent.[96] Since necessity of\r\nself-preservation can compel the latter on his part also to cross the\r\nneutral frontier and pursue and attack the enemy on neutral territory,\r\nthe part of such neutral territory concerned would for this reason\r\nbecome part of the region of war.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 94: There is no doubt that this attitude of Italy is explained\r\nby the fact that Egypt, although legally under Turkish suzerainty, is\r\nactually under British occupation, and that Crete is forcibly kept by\r\nthe Powers under Turkish suzerainty.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 95: See below, § 320.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 96: See below, § 339.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Exclusion from region of war through neutralisation.]\r\n\r\n§ 72. Although the Open Sea in its whole extent and the whole of the\r\nterritories of the belligerents are as a rule within the region of war,\r\ncertain parts can be excluded through neutralisation. Such\r\nneutralisation can take place permanently through a general treaty of\r\nthe Powers or temporarily through a special treaty of the belligerents.\r\nAt present no part of the Open Sea is neutralised, as the neutralisation\r\nof the Black Sea was abolished[97] in 1871. But the following are some\r\nimportant instances[98] of permanent neutralisation of parts of\r\nterritories:--\r\n\r\n(1) The former Sardinian, but since 1860 French, provinces of Chablais\r\nand Faucigny[99] are permanently neutralised through article 92 of the\r\nAct of the Vienna Congress, 1815.\r\n\r\n(2) The Ionian Islands through article 2 of the Treaty of London of\r\nNovember 14, 1863, are permanently neutralised since they merged in the\r\nkingdom of Greece. But this neutralisation was restricted[100] to the\r\nislands of Corfu and Paxo only by article 2 of the treaty of London of\r\nMarch 24, 1864.\r\n\r\n(3) The Suez Canal is permanently neutralised[101] since 1888.\r\n\r\n(4) The Straits of Magellan[102] are permanently neutralised through\r\narticle 5 of the boundary treaty of Buenos Ayres of July 23, 1881. But\r\nthis treaty is not a general treaty of the Powers, since it is concluded\r\nbetween Argentina and Chili only.\r\n\r\n(5) The Panama[103] Canal is permanently neutralised through article 3\r\nof the Hay-Pauncefote treaty of November 18, 1901. But this treaty is\r\nnot a general treaty of the Powers either, being concluded between only\r\nGreat Britain and the United States.\r\n\r\n(6) A piece of territory along the frontier between Sweden and Norway is\r\nneutralised by the Convention of Stockholm of October 26, 1905, which\r\nincludes rules concerning a neutral zone.[104] But this is a\r\nneutralisation agreed upon between Sweden and Norway only, no third\r\nPower has anything to do with it, and even the contracting Powers\r\nstipulate--see article 1, last paragraph--that the neutralisation shall\r\nnot be valid in the case of a war against a common enemy.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 97: See above, vol. I. §§ 181 and 256.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 98: The matter is thoroughly treated in Rettich, _Zur Theorie\r\nund Geschichte des Rechtes zum Kriege_ (1888), pp. 174-213, where also\r\nthe neutralisation of some so-called international rivers, especially\r\nthe Danube, Congo, and Niger, is discussed.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 99: See above, vol. I. § 207.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 100: See Martens, _N.R.G._ XVIII. p. 63.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 101: See above, vol. I. § 183.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 102: See Martens, _N.R.G._ 2nd Ser. XII. p. 491, and above,\r\nvol. I. § 195, p. 267, note 2, and § 568, p. 592, note 2.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 103: See above, vol. I. § 184.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 104: See Martens, _N.R.G._ 2nd Ser. XXXIV. (1907), p. 703.]\r\n\r\nAs regards temporary neutralisation, it is possible for parts of the\r\nterritories of belligerents and certain parts of the Open Sea to become\r\nneutralised through a treaty of the belligerents for the time of a\r\nparticular war only. Thus, when in 1870 war broke out between France and\r\nGermany, the commander of the French man-of-war[105] _Dupleix_ arranged\r\nwith the commander of the German man-of-war _Hertha_--both stationed in\r\nthe Japanese and Chinese waters--that they should, through their\r\nembassies in Yokohama, propose to their respective Governments the\r\nneutralisation of the Japanese and Chinese waters for the time of the\r\nwar. Germany consented, but France refused the neutralisation. Again, at\r\nthe commencement of the Turco-Italian War in 1911, Turkey proposed the\r\nneutralisation of the Red Sea, but Italy refused to agree to it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 105: See Perels, § 33, p. 160, note 2.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Asserted exclusion of the Baltic Sea from the Region of War.]\r\n\r\n§ 73. That there is at present no part of the Open Sea neutralised is\r\nuniversally recognised, and this applies to the Baltic Sea, which is\r\nadmittedly part of the Open Sea. Some writers,[106] however, maintain\r\nthat the littoral States of the Baltic have a right to forbid all\r\nhostilities within the Baltic in case of a war between other States than\r\nthemselves, and could thereby neutralise the Baltic without the consent\r\nand even against the will of the belligerents. This opinion is based on\r\nthe fact that during the eighteenth century the littoral States of the\r\nBaltic claimed that right in several conventions, but it appears\r\nuntenable, because it is opposed to the universally recognised principle\r\nof the freedom of the Open Sea. As no State has territorial supremacy\r\nover parts of the Open Sea, I cannot see how such a right of the\r\nlittoral States of the Baltic could be justified.[107]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 106: See Perels, pp. 160-163, who discusses the question at\r\nsome length and answers it in the affirmative.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 107: See Rivier, II. p. 218; Bonfils, § 504; Nys, I. pp.\r\n448-450.]\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nTHE BELLIGERENTS\r\n\r\n  Vattel, III. § 4--Phillimore, III. §§ 92-93--Taylor, §§\r\n  458-460--Wheaton, § 294--Bluntschli, §§ 511-514--Heffter, §§\r\n  114-117--Lueder in Holtzendorff, IV. pp. 237-248--Klüber, §\r\n  236--G.

As the Law of Nations recognises the status of war and its effects\r\nas regards rights and duties between the two or more belligerents on the\r\none hand, and, on the other, between the belligerents and neutral\r\nStates, the question arises what kind of States are legally qualified\r\nto make war and to become thereby belligerents. Publicists who discuss\r\nthis question at all speak mostly of a _right_ of States to make war, a\r\n_jus belli_. But if this so-called right is examined, it turns out to be\r\nno right at all, as there is no corresponding duty in those against whom\r\nthe right is said to exist.[108] A State which makes war against another\r\nexercises one of its natural functions, and the only question is whether\r\nsuch State is or is not legally qualified to exercise such function.\r\nNow, according to the Law of Nations full-Sovereign States alone possess\r\nthe legal qualification to become belligerents; half-and part-Sovereign\r\nStates are not legally qualified to become belligerents. Since\r\nneutralised States, as Switzerland, Belgium, and Luxemburg, are\r\nfull-Sovereign States, they are legally qualified to become\r\nbelligerents, although their neutralisation binds them not to make use\r\nof their qualification except for defence. If they become belligerents\r\nbecause they are attacked, they do not lose their character as\r\nneutralised States, but if they become belligerents for offensive\r\npurposes they _ipso facto_ lose this character.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 108: See Heilborn, _System_, p. 333.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Possibility in contradistinction to qualification to become a\r\nBelligerent.]\r\n\r\n§ 75. Such States as do not possess the legal qualification to become\r\nbelligerents are by law prohibited from offensive or defensive warfare.\r\nBut the possession of armed forces makes it possible for them in fact to\r\nenter into war and to become belligerents. History records instances\r\nenough of such States having actually made war. Thus in 1876 Servia and\r\nMontenegro, although at that time vassal States under Turkish\r\nsuzerainty, declared war against Turkey, and in March 1877, peace was\r\nconcluded between Turkey and Servia.[109] And when in April 1877 war\r\nbroke out between Russia and Turkey, the then Turkish vassal State\r\nRoumania joined Russia, and Servia declared war anew against Turkey in\r\nDecember 1877. Further in November 1885 a war was waged between Servia,\r\nwhich had become a full-Sovereign State, and Bulgaria, which was at the\r\ntime still a vassal State under Turkish suzerainty; the war lasted\r\nactually only a fortnight, but the formal treaty of peace was not signed\r\nuntil March 3, 1886, at Bukarest.[110] And although Turkey is a party to\r\nthis treaty, Bulgaria appears as a party thereto independently and on\r\nits own behalf.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 109: See Martens, _N.R.G._ 2nd Ser. IV. pp. 12, 14, 172.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 110: See Martens, _N.R.G._ 2nd Ser. IV. p. 284.]\r\n\r\nWhenever a case arises in which a State lacking the legal qualification\r\nto make war nevertheless actually makes war, such State is a\r\nbelligerent, the contention is real war and all the rules of\r\nInternational Law respecting warfare apply to it.[111] Therefore, an\r\narmed contention between the suzerain and the vassal, between a\r\nfull-Sovereign State and a vassal State under the suzerainty of another\r\nState, and, lastly, between a Federal State and one or more of its\r\nmembers, is war[112] in the technical sense of the term according to the\r\nLaw of Nations.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 111: This is quite apparent through the fact that Bulgaria by\r\naccession became a party to the Geneva Convention at a time when she was\r\nstill a vassal State under Turkish suzerainty.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 112: See above, § 56, and Baty, _International Law in South\r\nAfrica_ (1900), pp. 66-68.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Insurgents as a Belligerent Power.]\r\n\r\n§ 76. The distinction between legal qualification and actual power to\r\nmake war explains the fact that insurgents may become a belligerent\r\nPower. It is a customary rule of the Law of Nations that any State may\r\nrecognise insurgents as a belligerent Power, provided (1) they are in\r\npossession of a certain part of the territory of the legitimate\r\nGovernment; (2) they have set up a Government of their own; and (3) they\r\nconduct their armed contention with the legitimate Government according\r\nto the laws and usages of war.[113] Such insurgents in fact, although\r\nnot in law, form a State-like community, and practically they are making\r\nwar, although their contention is by International Law not considered as\r\nwar in the technical sense of the term as long as they have not received\r\nrecognition as a belligerent Power.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 113: See above, § 59. See also Rougier, _Les guerres civiles_,\r\n&c. (1903), pp. 372-447, and Westlake, I. pp. 50-57. The Institute of\r\nInternational Law, at its meeting at Neuchatel in 1900, adopted a body\r\nof nine articles concerning the rights and duties of foreign States in\r\ncase of an insurrection; articles 4-9 deal with the recognition of the\r\nbelligerency of insurgents. See _Annuaire_, XVIII. p. 227.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Principal and accessory Belligerent Parties.]\r\n\r\n§ 77. War occurs usually between two States, one belligerent party being\r\non each side. But there are cases in which there are on one or on both\r\nsides several parties, and in some of such cases principal and accessory\r\nbelligerent parties are to be distinguished.\r\n\r\nPrincipal belligerent parties are those parties to a war who wage it on\r\nthe basis of a treaty of alliance, whether such treaty was concluded\r\nbefore or during the war. On the other hand, accessory belligerent\r\nparties are such States as provide help and succour only in a limited\r\nway to a principal belligerent party at war with another State; for\r\ninstance, by paying subsidies, sending a certain number of troops or\r\nmen-of-war to take part in the contention, granting a coaling station to\r\nthe men-of-war of the principal party, allowing the latter's troops a\r\npassage through their territory, and the like. Such accessory party\r\nbecomes a belligerent through rendering help.\r\n\r\nThe matter need hardly be mentioned at all were it not for the fact that\r\nthe question was formerly discussed by publicists whether or not it\r\ninvolved a violation of neutrality on the part of a neutral State in\r\ncase it fulfilled in time of war a treaty concluded in time of peace, by\r\nthe terms of which it had to grant a coaling station, the passage of\r\ntroops through its territory, and the like, to one of the belligerents.\r\nThis question is identical with the question, to be treated below in §\r\n305, whether a qualified neutrality, in contradistinction to a perfect\r\nneutrality, is admissible. Since the answer to this question is in the\r\nnegative, such State as fulfils a treaty obligation of this kind in time\r\nof war may be considered by the other side an accessory belligerent\r\nparty to the war, and all doubt in the matter ought now to be removed\r\nsince article 2 of Convention V. of the Second Peace Conference[114]\r\ncategorically enacts that \"belligerents are forbidden to move across the\r\nterritory of a neutral Power troops or convoys either of munitions of\r\nwar or of supplies.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 114: See also article 3 of Convention V.]\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nTHE ARMED FORCES OF THE BELLIGERENTS\r\n\r\n  Vattel, III. §§ 223-231--Hall, §§ 177-179, 181--Lawrence, §§\r\n  148-150--Westlake, II. pp. 60-63--Manning, pp.\r\n  206-210--Phillimore, III. § 94--Twiss, II. § 45--Halleck, I. pp.\r\n  555-562--Taylor, §§ 471-476--Moore, VII. § 1109--Wheaton, §§\r\n  356-358--Bluntschli, §§ 569-572--Heffter, §§ 124-124A--Lueder in\r\n  Holtzendorff, IV. pp. 371-385--Klüber, 267--G.

The chief part of the armed forces of the belligerents are their\r\nregular armies and navies. What kinds of forces constitute a regular\r\narmy and a regular navy is not for International Law to determine, but a\r\nmatter of Municipal Law exclusively. Whether or not so-called Militia\r\nand Volunteer corps belong to armies rests entirely with the Municipal\r\nLaw of the belligerents. There are several States whose armies consist\r\nof Militia and Volunteer Corps exclusively, no standing army being\r\nprovided for. The Hague Regulations expressly stipulate in article 1\r\nthat in countries where Militia or Volunteer Corps constitute the army\r\nor form part of it they are included under the denomination \"Army.\" It\r\nis likewise irrelevant to consider the composition of a regular army,\r\nwhether it is based on conscription or not, whether natives only or\r\nforeigners also are enrolled, and the like.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Non-combatant Members of Armed Forces.]\r\n\r\n§ 79. In the main, armed forces consist of combatants, but no army in\r\nthe field consists of combatants exclusively, as there are always\r\nseveral kinds of other individuals, such as couriers, aeronauts,\r\ndoctors, farriers, veterinary surgeons, chaplains, nurses, official and\r\nvoluntary ambulance men, contractors, canteen-caterers, newspaper\r\ncorrespondents,[115] civil servants, diplomatists, and foreign military\r\nattachés[116] in the suite of the Commander-in-Chief.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 115: See Rey in _R.G._ XVII. (1910), pp. 73-102, and Higgins,\r\n_War and the Private Citizen_ (1912), pp. 91-114.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 116: See Rey in _R.G._ XVII. (1910), pp. 63-73.]\r\n\r\nWriters on the Law of Nations do not agree as regards the position of\r\nsuch individuals; they are not mere private individuals, but, on the\r\nother hand, are certainly not combatants, although they may--as, for\r\ninstance, couriers, doctors, farriers, and veterinary surgeons--have the\r\ncharacter of soldiers. They may correctly be said to belong _indirectly_\r\nto the armed forces. Article 3 of the Hague Regulations expressly\r\nstipulates that the armed forces of the belligerents may consist of\r\ncombatants and non-combatants, and that both in case of capture must be\r\ntreated as prisoners of war, provided[117] they produce a certificate of\r\nidentification from the military authorities of the army they are\r\naccompanying. However, when one speaks of armed forces generally,\r\ncombatants only are in consideration.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 117: See below, § 127.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Irregular Forces.]\r\n\r\n§ 80. Very often the armed forces of belligerents consist throughout the\r\nwar of their regular armies only, but, on the other hand, it happens\r\nfrequently that irregular forces take part in the war. Of such irregular\r\nforces there are two different kinds to be distinguished--first, such as\r\nare authorised by the belligerents; and, secondly, such as are acting on\r\ntheir own initiative and their own account without special\r\nauthorisation. Formerly it was a recognised rule of International Law\r\nthat only the members of authorised irregular forces enjoyed the\r\nprivileges due to the members of the armed forces of belligerents,\r\nwhereas members of unauthorised irregular forces were considered to be\r\nwar criminals and could be shot when captured. During the Franco-German\r\nwar in 1870 the Germans acted throughout according to this rule with\r\nregard to the so-called \"Franctireurs,\" requesting the production of a\r\nspecial authorisation from the French Government from every irregular\r\ncombatant they captured, failing which he was shot. But according to\r\narticle 1 of the Hague Regulations this rule is now obsolete, and its\r\nplace is taken by the rule that irregulars enjoy the privileges due to\r\nmembers of the armed forces of the belligerents, although they do not\r\nact under authorisation, provided (1) that they are commanded by a\r\nperson responsible for his subordinates, (2) that they have a fixed\r\ndistinctive emblem recognisable at a distance,[118] (3) that they carry\r\narms openly,[119] and (4) that they conduct their operations in\r\naccordance with the laws and customs of war. It must, however, be\r\nemphasised that this rule applies only to irregulars fighting in bodies,\r\nhowever small. Such individuals as take up arms or commit hostile acts\r\nsingly and severally are still liable to be treated as war criminals,\r\nand shot.[120]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 118: The distance at which the emblem should be visible is\r\nundetermined. See _Land Warfare_, § 23, where it is pointed out that it\r\nis reasonable to expect that the silhouette of an irregular combatant in\r\nthe position of standing against the skyline should be at once\r\ndistinguishable from the outline of a peaceable inhabitant, and this by\r\nthe naked eye of ordinary individuals, at a distance at which the form\r\nof an individual can be determined.--See Ariga, p. 87, concerning 120\r\nirregulars who were treated as criminals and shot by the Japanese after\r\nthe occupation of Vladimirowka on the island of Sakhaline.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 119: See _Land Warfare_, § 26; individuals whose sole arm is a\r\npistol, hand-grenade, a dagger concealed about the person, or a\r\nsword-stick, are not such as carry their arms openly.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 120: See below, § 254.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Levies _en masse_.]\r\n\r\n§ 81. It sometimes happens during war that on the approach of the enemy\r\na belligerent calls the whole population of the country to arms and thus\r\nmakes them a part, although a more or less irregular part, of his armed\r\nforces. Provided they receive some organisation and comply with the laws\r\nand usages of war, the combatants who take part in such a levy _en\r\nmasse_ organised by the State enjoy the privileges due to members of\r\narmed forces.\r\n\r\nIt sometimes happens, further, during wars, that a levy _en masse_ takes\r\nplace spontaneously without organisation by a belligerent, and the\r\nquestion arises whether or not those who take part in such levies _en\r\nmasse_ belong to the armed forces of the belligerents, and therefore\r\nenjoy the privileges due to members of such forces. Article 2 of the\r\nHague Regulations stipulates that the population of a territory not yet\r\noccupied who, on the enemy's approach, spontaneously take up arms to\r\nresist the invading enemy, without having time to organise themselves\r\nunder responsible commanders and to procure fixed distinctive emblems\r\nrecognisable at a distance, shall nevertheless enjoy the privileges due\r\nto armed forces, provided that they carry arms openly and act otherwise\r\nin conformity with the laws and usages of war. But this case is totally\r\ndifferent from a levy _en masse_ of the population of a territory\r\nalready invaded by the enemy, for the purpose of freeing the country\r\nfrom the invader. The stipulation of the Hague Regulations quoted above\r\ndoes not cover this case, in which, therefore, the old customary rule of\r\nInternational Law is valid, that those taking part in such a levy _en\r\nmasse_, if captured, are liable to be shot.[121]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 121: See below, § 254. Article 85 of the American\r\n_Instructions for the Government of Armies in the Field_ of 1863 has\r\nenacted this rule as follows: \"War rebels are persons within an occupied\r\nterritory who rise in arms against the occupying or conquering army, or\r\nagainst the authorities established by the same. If captured, they may\r\nsuffer death, whether they rise singly, in small or large bands, and\r\nwhether called upon to do so by their own, but expelled Government or\r\nnot....\"]\r\n\r\nIt is of particular importance not to confound invasion with occupation\r\nin this matter. Article 2 distinctly speaks of the _approach_ of the\r\nenemy, and thereby sanctions only such a levy _en masse_ as takes place\r\nin territory not yet _invaded_ by the enemy. Once the territory is\r\ninvaded, although the invasion has not yet ripened into occupation,[122]\r\na levy _en masse_ is no longer legitimate. But, of course, the term\r\n_territory_, as used by article 2, is not intended to mean[123] the\r\nwhole extent of the State of a belligerent, but refers only to such\r\nparts of it as are not yet invaded. For this reason, if a town is\r\nalready invaded, but not a neighbouring town, the inhabitants of the\r\nlatter may, on the approach of the enemy, legitimately rise _en masse_.\r\nAnd it matters not whether the individuals taking part in the levy _en\r\nmasse_ are acting in immediate combination with a regular army or\r\nseparately from it.[124]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 122: Concerning the difference between invasion and\r\noccupation, see below, § 167.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 123: See _Land Warfare_, §§ 31-32.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 124: See _Land Warfare_, § 34.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Barbarous Forces.]\r\n\r\n§ 82. As International Law grew up amongst the States of Christendom,\r\nand as the circle of the members of the Family of Nations includes only\r\ncivilised, although not necessarily Christian, States, all writers on\r\nInternational Law agree that in wars between themselves the members of\r\nthe Family of Nations should not make use of barbarous forces--that is,\r\ntroops consisting of individuals belonging to savage tribes and\r\nbarbarous races. But it can hardly be maintained that a rule of this\r\nkind has customarily grown up in practice, nor has it been stipulated by\r\ntreaties, and the Hague Regulations overlook this point. This being the\r\nfact, it is difficult to say whether the members of such barbarous\r\nforces, if employed in a war between members of the Family of Nations,\r\nwould enjoy the privileges due to members of armed forces generally. I\r\nsee no reason why they should not, provided such barbarous forces would\r\nor could comply with the laws and usages of war prevalent according to\r\nInternational Law. But the very fact that they are barbarians makes it\r\nprobable that they could or would not do so, and then it would be\r\nunreasonable to grant them the privileges generally due to members of\r\narmed forces, and it would be necessary to treat them according to\r\ndiscretion.[125] But it must be specially observed that the employment\r\nof barbarous forces must not be confounded with the enrolling of\r\ncoloured individuals into the regular army and the employment of\r\nregiments consisting of disciplined coloured soldiers. There is no\r\nreason whatever why, for instance, the members of a regiment eventually\r\nformed by the United States of America out of negroes bred and educated\r\nin America, or why members of Indian regiments under English commanders,\r\nif employed in wars between members of the Family of Nations, should not\r\nenjoy the privileges due to the members of armed forces according to\r\nInternational Law.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 125: As regards the limited use made of armed natives as\r\nscouts, and the like, on the part of the British commanders during the\r\nSouth-African War, see _The Times' History of the War in South Africa_,\r\npp. 249-251. The Boers refused quarter to any such armed natives as fell\r\ninto their hands.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Privateers.]\r\n\r\n§ 83. Formerly privateers were a generally recognised part of the armed\r\nforces of the belligerents, private vessels being commissioned by the\r\nbelligerents through Letters of Marque to carry on hostilities at sea,\r\nand particularly to capture enemy merchantmen.[126] From the fifteenth\r\ncentury, when privateering began to grow up, down to the eighteenth\r\ncentury, belligerents used to grant such Letters of Marque to private\r\nships owned by their subjects and by the subjects of neutral States. But\r\nduring the eighteenth century the practice grew up that belligerents\r\ngranted Letters of Marque to private ships of their own subjects\r\nonly.[127] However, privateering was abolished by the Declaration of\r\nParis in 1856 as between the signatory Powers and others who joined it\r\nlater. And although privateering would still be legal as between other\r\nPowers, it will in future scarcely be made use of. In all the wars that\r\noccurred after 1856 between such Powers, no Letters of Marque were\r\ngranted to private ships.[128]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 126: See Martens, _Essai concernant les armateurs, les prises,\r\net surtout les reprises_ (1795).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 127: Many publicists maintain that nowadays a privateer\r\ncommissioned by another State than that of which he is a subject is\r\nliable to be treated as a pirate when captured. With this, however, I\r\ncannot agree; see above, vol. I. § 273, Hall, § 81, and below, § 330.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 128: See below, § 177. It is confidently to be hoped that the\r\ngreat progress made by the abolition of privateering through the\r\nDeclaration of Paris will never be undone. But it is of importance to\r\nnote the fact that up to the present day endeavours have been made on\r\nthe part of freelances to win public opinion for a retrograde step. See,\r\nfor instance, Munro-Butler Johnstone, _Handbook of Maritime Rights; and\r\nthe Declaration of Paris Considered_ (1876), and Gibson Bowles, _The\r\nDeclaration of Paris of 1856_ (1900); see also Perels, pp. 177-179. The\r\nDeclaration of Paris being a law-making treaty which does not provide\r\nthe right of the several signatory Powers to give notice of withdrawal,\r\na signatory Power is not at liberty to give such notice, although Mr.\r\nGibson Bowles (_op. cit._ pp. 169-179) asserts that this could be done.\r\nSee above, vol. I. § 12.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Converted Merchantmen.]\r\n\r\n§ 84. A case which happened in 1870, soon after the outbreak of the\r\nFranco-German war, gave occasion for the question whether converted\r\nmerchantmen could be considered a part of the armed naval forces of a\r\nbelligerent. As the North-German Confederation owned only a few\r\nmen-of-war, the creation of a volunteer fleet was intended. The King of\r\nPrussia, as President of the Confederation, invited the owners of\r\nprivate German vessels to make them a part of the German navy under the\r\nfollowing conditions: Every ship should be assessed as to her value, and\r\n10 per cent. of such value should at once be paid in cash to the owner\r\nas a price for the charter of the ship. The owner should engage the crew\r\nhimself, but the latter should become for the time of the war members of\r\nthe German navy, wear the German naval uniform, and the ship should sail\r\nunder the German war flag and be armed and adapted for her purpose by\r\nthe German naval authorities. Should the ship be captured or destroyed\r\nby the enemy, the assessed value should be paid to her owners in full;\r\nbut should it be restored after the war undamaged, the owner should\r\nretain the 10 per cent. received as charter price. All such vessels\r\nshould only try to capture or destroy French men-of-war, and if\r\nsuccessful the owner should receive a sum between £1500 and £7500 as\r\npremium. The French Government considered this scheme a disguised\r\nevasion of the Declaration of Paris which abolished privateering, and\r\nrequested the intervention of Great Britain. The British Government\r\nbrought the case before the Law Officers of the Crown, who declared the\r\nGerman scheme to be substantially different from the revival of\r\nprivateering, and consequently the British Government refused to object\r\nto it. The scheme, however, was never put into practice.[129]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 129: See Perels, § 34; Hall, § 182; Boeck, No. 211; Dupuis,\r\nNos. 81-84.]\r\n\r\nNow, in spite of the opinion of the British Law Officers, writers on\r\nInternational Law differ as to the legality of the above scheme; but, on\r\nthe other hand, they are unanimous that not every scheme for a voluntary\r\nfleet is to be rejected. Russia,[130] in fact, since 1877, has possessed\r\na voluntary fleet. France[131] has made arrangements with certain\r\nsteamship companies according to which their mail-boats have to be\r\nconstructed on plans approved by the Government, have to be commanded by\r\nofficers of the French navy, and have to be incorporated in the French\r\nnavy at the outbreak of war. Great Britain from 1887 onwards has entered\r\ninto agreements with several powerful British steamship companies for\r\nthe purpose of securing their vessels at the outbreak of hostilities;\r\nand the United States of America in 1892 made similar arrangements with\r\nthe American Line.[132]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 130: See Dupuis, No. 85.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 131: See Dupuis, No. 86.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 132: See Lawrence, § 201, and Dupuis, Nos. 87-88. On the whole\r\nquestion see Pradier-Fodéré, VIII. Nos. 3102-3103.]\r\n\r\nMatters were brought to a climax in 1904, during the Russo-Japanese War,\r\nthrough the cases of the _Peterburg_ and the _Smolensk_.[133] On July 4\r\nand 6 of that year, these vessels, which belonged to the Russian\r\nvolunteer fleet in the Black Sea, were allowed to pass the Bosphorus and\r\nthe Dardanelles, which are closed[134] to men-of-war of all nations,\r\nbecause they were flying the Russian commercial flag. They likewise\r\npassed the Suez Canal under their commercial flag, but after leaving\r\nSuez they converted themselves into men-of-war by hoisting the Russian\r\nwar flag, and began to exercise over neutral merchantmen all rights of\r\nsupervision which belligerents can claim for their cruisers in time of\r\nwar. On July 13 the _Peterburg_ captured the British P. & O. steamer\r\n_Malacca_ for alleged carriage of contraband, and put a prize-crew on\r\nboard for the purpose of navigating her to Libau. But the British\r\nGovernment protested; the _Malacca_ was released at Algiers on her way\r\nto Libau on July 27, and Russia agreed that the _Peterburg_ and the\r\n_Smolensk_ should no longer act as cruisers, and that all neutral\r\nvessels captured by them should be released.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 133: See the details of the career of these vessels in\r\nLawrence, _War_, pp. 205 _seq._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 134: See above, vol. I. § 197.]\r\n\r\nThis case was the cause of the question of the conversion of merchantmen\r\ninto men-of-war being taken up by the Second Peace Conference in 1907,\r\nwhich produced Convention VII. on the matter.[135] This Convention,\r\nwhich is signed by all the States represented at the Conference except\r\nthe United States of America, China, San Domingo, Nicaragua, and\r\nUruguay--but Nicaragua acceded later--comprises twelve articles; its\r\nmore important stipulations are the following: No converted vessel can\r\nhave the status of a warship unless she is placed under the direct\r\nauthority, immediate control, and responsibility of the Power whose flag\r\nshe flies (article 1). Such a vessel must, therefore, bear the external\r\nmarks which distinguish the warships of her nationality (article 2); the\r\ncommander must be in the service of the State concerned, must be duly\r\ncommissioned, and his name must figure on the list of the officers of\r\nthe military fleet (article 3); and the crew must be subject to the\r\nrules of military discipline (article 4). A converted vessel must\r\nobserve the laws and usages of war (article 5) and her conversion must\r\nas soon as possible be announced by the belligerent concerned in the\r\nlist of the ships of his military fleet (article 6).\r\n\r\n[Footnote 135: See Wilson in _A.J._ II. (1908), pp. 271-275; Lémonon,\r\npp. 607-622; Higgins, pp. 312-321; Dupuis, Nos. 48-58; Nippold, II. pp.\r\n73-84; Scott, _Conferences_, pp. 568-576; Higgins, _War and the Private\r\nCitizen_ (1912), pp. 115-168.]\r\n\r\nThe opinion, which largely prevails, that through this admittance of the\r\nconversion of merchantmen into men-of-war privateering has been revived,\r\nis absolutely unfounded, for the rules stipulated by Convention VII. in\r\nno way abrogate the rule of the Declaration of Paris that privateering\r\nis and remains abolished. But the Convention does not give satisfaction\r\nin so far as it does not settle the questions where the conversion of a\r\nvessel may be performed, and whether it is permitted to reconvert,\r\nbefore the termination of the war, into a merchantman a vessel which\r\nduring the war had been converted into a warship. The fact is, the\r\nPowers could not come to an agreement on these two points, the one party\r\nclaiming that conversion could only be performed within a harbour of the\r\nconverting Power, or an enemy harbour occupied by it, the other party\r\ndefending the claim to convert likewise on the High Seas. One must look\r\nto the future for a compromise that will settle this vexed controversy.\r\nIt is, however, important to notice the fact that the preamble of\r\nConvention VII. states expressly that the question of the place where a\r\nconversion may be performed remains open. Those Powers which claim that\r\nconversions[136] must not take place on the High Seas are not,\r\ntherefore, prevented from refusing to acknowledge the public character\r\nof any vessel which had been converted on the High Seas, and from\r\nupholding their view that a converted vessel may not alternately claim\r\nthe character and the privileges of a belligerent man-of-war and a\r\nmerchantman.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 136: Concerning the question whether an enemy merchantman,\r\ncaptured on the High Seas, may at once be converted into a warship, see\r\nbelow, p. 231, _note_ 2.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Crews of Merchantmen.]\r\n\r\n§ 85. In a sense the crews of merchantmen owned by subjects of the\r\nbelligerents belong to the latter's armed forces. For those vessels are\r\nliable to be seized by enemy men-of-war, and if attacked for that\r\npurpose they may defend themselves, may return the attack, and\r\neventually seize the attacking men-of-war. The crews of merchantmen\r\nbecome in such cases combatants, and enjoy all the privileges of the\r\nmembers of armed forces. But unless attacked they must not commit\r\nhostilities, and if they do so they are liable to be treated as\r\ncriminals just as are private individuals who commit hostilities in land\r\nwarfare. Some writers[137] assert that, although merchantmen of the\r\nbelligerents are not competent to exercise the right of visit, search,\r\nand capture towards neutral vessels, they may attack enemy\r\nvessels--merchantmen as well as public vessels--not merely in\r\nself-defence but even without having been previously attacked, and that,\r\nconsequently, the crews must in such case enjoy the privileges due to\r\nmembers of the armed forces. But this opinion is absolutely without\r\nfoundation nowadays,[138] even in former times it was not generally\r\nrecognised.[139]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 137: See Wheaton, § 357; Taylor, § 496; Walker, p. 135, and\r\n_Science_, p. 268.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 138: See below, § 181, and Hall, § 183.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 139: See Vattel, III. § 226, and G. F. Martens, II. § 289.]\r\n\r\nIt should be mentioned in regard to the fate of the crews of captured\r\nmerchantmen that a distinction is to be made according as to whether or\r\nno a vessel has defended herself against a legitimate attack. In the\r\nfirst case the members of the crew become prisoners of war, for by\r\nlegitimately taking part in the fighting they have become members of the\r\narmed forces of the enemy.[140] In the second case, articles 5 to 7 of\r\nConvention XI. of the Second Peace Conference enact the following\r\nrules:[141]--\r\n\r\n(1) Such members of the crew as are subjects of neutral States may not\r\nbe made prisoners of war.\r\n\r\n(2) The captain and the officers who are subjects of neutral States may\r\nonly be made prisoners if they refuse to give a promise in writing not\r\nto serve on an enemy ship while the war lasts.\r\n\r\n(3) The captain, officers, and such members of the crew who are enemy\r\nsubjects may only be made prisoners if they refuse to give a written\r\npromise not to engage, while hostilities last, in any service connected\r\nwith the operations of war.\r\n\r\n(4) The names of all the individuals retaining their liberty under\r\nparole must be notified by the captor to the enemy, and the latter is\r\nforbidden knowingly to employ the individuals concerned in any service\r\nprohibited by the parole.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 140: This follows indirectly from article 8 of Convention XI.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 141: See below, § 201.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Deserters and Traitors.]\r\n\r\n§ 86. The privileges of members of armed forces cannot be claimed by\r\nmembers of the armed forces of a belligerent who go over to the forces\r\nof the enemy and are afterwards captured by the former. They may be, and\r\nalways are, treated as criminals. And the like is valid with regard to\r\nsuch treasonable subjects of a belligerent as, without having been\r\nmembers of his armed forces, are fighting in the armed forces of the\r\nenemy. Even if they appear under the protection of a flag of truce,\r\ndeserters and traitors may be seized and punished.[142]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 142: See below, § 222; Hall, § 190; _Land Warfare_, § 36.]\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nENEMY CHARACTER\r\n\r\n  Grotius, III. c. 4, §§ 6 and 7--Bynkershoek, _Quaestiones juris\r\n  publici_, I. c. 3 _in fine_--Hall, §§ 167-175--Lawrence, §§\r\n  151-159--Westlake, II. pp. 140-154--Phillimore, III. §§\r\n  82-86--Twiss, II. §§ 152-162--Taylor, §§ 468 and 517--Walker, §§\r\n  39-43--Wharton, III. §§ 352-353--Wheaton, §§ 324-341--Moore, VII.\r\n  §§ 1185-1194--Geffcken in Holtzendorff, IV. pp. 581-588--Ullmann,\r\n  § 192--Nys, III. pp. 150-154--Pradier-Fodéré, VIII.

Since the belligerents, for the realisation of the purpose of war,\r\nare entitled to many kinds of measures against enemy persons and enemy\r\nproperty, the question must be settled as to what persons and what\r\nproperty are vested with enemy character. Now it is, generally speaking,\r\ncorrect to say that, whereas the subjects of the belligerents and the\r\nproperty of such subjects bear enemy character, the subjects of neutral\r\nStates and the property of such subjects do not bear enemy character.\r\nThis rule has, however, important exceptions. For under certain\r\ncircumstances and conditions enemy persons and property of enemy\r\nsubjects may not bear, and, on the other hand, subjects of neutral\r\nStates and their property may bear, enemy character. And it is even\r\npossible that a subject of a belligerent may for some parts bear enemy\r\ncharacter as between himself and his home State.\r\n\r\nThe matter of enemy character is, however, to a great extent in an\r\nunsettled condition, since on many points connected with it there are no\r\nuniversally recognised rules of International Law in existence. British\r\nand American Courts have worked out a body of precise and clear rules on\r\nthe subject, but the practice of other countries, and especially of\r\nFrance, follows different lines. The Second Peace Conference of 1907\r\nproduced three articles on the matter--16, 17, and 18--in Convention V.,\r\naccepted by all the signatory Powers, except Great Britain which, upon\r\nsigning the Convention, entered a reservation against these three\r\narticles, and although these articles are only of minor importance, they\r\nhave to be taken into consideration. On the other hand, the as yet\r\nunratified Declaration of London comprises a number of rules which,\r\napart from two points, offer a common basis for the practice of all\r\nmaritime States. At the first glance it would seem that only the four\r\narticles--57 to 60--of Chapter VI. headed \"Enemy Character,\" treat of\r\nthe subject under survey, but a closer examination shows that article\r\n46, dealing with a certain kind of unneutral service, articles 55 and\r\n56, dealing with transfer to a neutral flag, and, lastly, article 63,\r\ndealing with forcible resistance to the right of visitation, are also\r\nconcerned with enemy character. In spite of these stipulations, which\r\nare accepted by all the Powers concerned, there remain two important\r\npoints unsettled, since neither the Second Hague Peace Conference of\r\n1907 nor the Naval Conference of London of 1908-9 succeeded in agreeing\r\nupon a compromise concerning the old controversy as to whether\r\nnationality exclusively, or domicile also, should determine the neutral\r\nor enemy character of individuals and their goods, and further, whether\r\nor not neutral vessels acquire enemy character by embarking in time of\r\nwar, with permission of the enemy, upon such trade with the latter as\r\nwas closed to them in time of peace (Rule of 1756). According to article\r\n7 of Convention XII. of the Second Hague Peace Conference, concerning\r\nthe establishment of an International Prize Court, likewise not yet\r\nratified, this Court would in time have to evolve a uniform practice of\r\nall the maritime States on these two points.\r\n\r\nFor the consideration of enemy character in detail, it is convenient to\r\ndistinguish between individuals, vessels, goods, the transfer of enemy\r\nvessels, and the transfer of enemy goods on enemy vessels.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Enemy Character of Individuals.]\r\n\r\n§ 88. The general rule with regard to individuals is that subjects of\r\nthe belligerents bear enemy character, whereas subjects of neutral\r\nStates do not. In this sense article 16 of Convention V. stipulates:\r\n\"The nationals of a State which is not taking part in the war are\r\nconsidered to be neutral.\" These neutral individuals can, however, lose\r\ntheir neutral and acquire enemy character in several cases, just as\r\nsubjects of the belligerents can in other cases lose their enemy\r\ncharacter:--\r\n\r\n(1) Since relations of peace obtain between either of the belligerents\r\nand neutral States, the subjects of the latter can, by way of trade and\r\notherwise, render many kinds of service to either belligerent without\r\nthereby losing their neutral character. On the other hand, if they enter\r\nthe armed forces of a belligerent, or if they commit other acts in his\r\nfavour, or commit hostile acts against a belligerent, they acquire\r\nenemy character (article 17 of Convention V.). All measures that are\r\nallowed during war against enemy subjects are likewise allowed against\r\nsuch subjects of neutral Powers as have thus acquired enemy character.\r\nFor instance, during the late South African War hundreds of subjects of\r\nneutral States, who were fighting in the ranks of the Boers, were\r\ncaptured by Great Britain and retained as prisoners until the end of the\r\nstruggle. Such individuals must not, however, be more severely treated\r\nthan enemy subjects, and, in especial, no punitive measures are allowed\r\nagainst them (article 17 of Convention V.). And article 18(_a_) of\r\nConvention V. stipulates expressly that subjects of neutral States not\r\ninhabiting the territory of the enemy or any territory militarily\r\noccupied by him do not acquire enemy character by furnishing supplies or\r\nmaking loans to the enemy, provided the supplies do not come from the\r\nenemy territory or any territory occupied by him.[143]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 143: Since Great Britain has entered a reservation against\r\narticles 16, 17, and 18 of Convention V. she is not bound by them. It\r\nis, however, of importance to state that articles 16, 17, and\r\n18(_a_)--not 18(_b_)!--enact only such rules as were always customarily\r\nrecognised, _unless such an interpretation is to be put upon article 16\r\nas prevents a belligerent from considering subjects of neutral States\r\ninhabiting the enemy country as bearing enemy character_. The matter is\r\ndifferent with regard to article 18(_b_), which creates an entirely new\r\nrule, for nobody has hitherto doubted that the members of the police\r\nforce and the administrative officials of the enemy bear enemy character\r\nwhether or no they are subjects of the enemy State.]\r\n\r\nArticle 18(_b_) of Convention V. stipulates that such subjects of\r\nneutral States as render services to the enemy in matters of police and\r\nadministration, likewise do not acquire enemy character. This\r\nstipulation must, however, be read with caution. It can only mean that\r\nsuch individuals do not lose their neutral character to a greater degree\r\nthan other subjects of neutral States resident on enemy territory; it\r\ncannot mean that they are in every way to be considered and treated\r\nlike subjects of neutral States not residing on enemy territory.\r\n\r\nHowever that may be, it must be specially observed, that the acts by\r\nwhich subjects of neutral States lose their neutral and acquire enemy\r\ncharacter need not necessarily be committed after the outbreak of war.\r\nSuch individuals can, even before the outbreak of war, identify\r\nthemselves to such a degree with a foreign State that, with the outbreak\r\nof war against that State, enemy character devolves upon them _ipso\r\nfacto_ unless they at once sever their connection with such State. This,\r\nfor instance, is the case when a foreign subject in time of peace\r\nenlists in the armed forces of a State and continues to serve after the\r\noutbreak of war.\r\n\r\n(2) From the time when International Law made its appearance down to our\r\nown no difference has been made by a belligerent in the treatment\r\naccorded to subjects of the enemy and subjects of neutral States\r\ninhabiting the enemy country. Thus Grotius (III. c. 4, §§ 6 and 7)\r\nteaches that foreigners must share the fate of the population living on\r\nenemy territory, and Bynkershoek[144] distinctly teaches that foreigners\r\nresiding in enemy country bear enemy character. English[145] and\r\nAmerican practice assert, therefore, that foreigners, whether subjects\r\nof the belligerents or of neutral States, acquire enemy character by\r\nbeing domiciled (_i.e._ resident) in enemy country, because they have\r\nthereby identified themselves with the enemy population and contribute,\r\nby paying taxes and the like, to the support of the enemy Government.\r\nFor this reason, all measures which may legitimately be taken against\r\nthe civil population of the enemy territory, may likewise be taken\r\nagainst them, unless they withdraw from the country or are expelled\r\ntherefrom. It must, however, be remembered that they acquire enemy\r\ncharacter _in a sense_ and _to a certain degree_ only, for their enemy\r\ncharacter is not as intensive as that of enemy subjects resident on\r\nenemy territory. Such of them as are subjects of neutral States do not,\r\ntherefore, lose the protection of their home State against arbitrary\r\ntreatment inconsistent with the laws of war; and such of them as are\r\nsubjects of the other belligerent are handed over to the protection of\r\nthe Embassy of a neutral Power. However that may be, they are not exempt\r\nfrom requisitions and contributions; from the restrictions which an\r\noccupant imposes upon the population in the interest of the safety of\r\nhis troops and his military operations; from punishments for hostile\r\nacts committed against the occupant; or from being taken into captivity,\r\nif exceptionally necessary.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 144: _Quaestiones juris publici_, I. c. 3 _in fine_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 145: See the _Harmony_ (1800), 2 C. Rob. 322; the _Johanna\r\nEmilie_, otherwise _Emilia_ (1854), Spinks, 12; the _Baltica_ (1857), 11\r\nMoore, P.C. 141.]\r\n\r\nThis treatment of foreigners resident on occupied enemy territory is\r\ngenerally recognised as legitimate by theory[146] and practice. The\r\nproposal of Germany, made at the Second Peace Conference, to agree upon\r\nrules which would have stipulated a more favourable treatment of\r\nsubjects of neutral States resident on occupied enemy territory was,\r\ntherefore, rejected. Not even France supported the German proposals,\r\nalthough according to the French conception foreigners residing in enemy\r\ncountry do not acquire enemy character, and therefore the German\r\nproposals were only a logical consequence of the French conception. This\r\nFrench conception of enemy character dates from the judgment of the\r\n_Conseil des Prises_ in the case of _Le Hardy contre La\r\nVoltigeante_[147] (1802), which laid down the rule that neutral subjects\r\nresiding in enemy country do not lose their neutral character, and enemy\r\nsubjects residing in neutral countries do not lose their enemy\r\ncharacter. But it must be emphasised that this French conception of\r\nenemy character has been developed, not with regard to the treatment of\r\nforeigners whom an occupant finds resident on occupied enemy territory,\r\nbut with regard to the exercise of the right of capture of enemy vessels\r\nand goods in warfare at sea. France did not make an attempt to draw the\r\nlogical consequences from this conception and, therefore, to mete out to\r\nforeigners resident on occupied enemy territory a treatment different\r\nfrom that of enemy subjects resident there.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 146: See Albrecht, _Requisitionen von neutralem\r\nPrivateigenthum_, &c. (1912), pp. 13-15.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 147: 1 Pistoye et Duverdy (1859), 321.]\r\n\r\n(3) Since enemy subjects who reside in neutral countries, or are allowed\r\nto remain resident on the territory of the other belligerent, have to a\r\ngreat extent identified themselves with the local population and are not\r\nunder the territorial supremacy of the enemy, they lose their enemy\r\ncharacter according to English and American practice,[148] but according\r\nto French practice they do not, a difference of practice which bears\r\nupon many points, especially upon the character of goods.[149]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 148: See the _Postilion_ (1779), Hay & Marriot, 245; the\r\n_Danous_ (1802), 4 C. Rob. 255, note; the _Venus_ (1814), 8 Cranch,\r\n253.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 149: See below, § 90.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Enemy Character of Vessels.]\r\n\r\n§ 89. The general rule with regard to vessels is that their character is\r\ndetermined by their flag. Whatever may be the nationality of the owner\r\nof a vessel--whether he be a subject of a neutral State, or of either\r\nbelligerent--she bears enemy character, if she be sailing under the\r\nenemy flag. For this reason, the vessel of an enemy owner which sails\r\nunder a neutral flag does as little bear enemy character as the vessel\r\nof the subject of a neutral State sailing under the flag of another\r\nneutral State. But the flag is the deciding factor only when the vessel\r\nis legitimately sailing under it. Should it be found that a vessel\r\nsailing under the flag of a certain neutral State has, according to the\r\nMunicipal Law of such State, no right to fly the flag she shows, the\r\nreal character of the vessel must be determined in order to decide\r\nwhether or no she bears enemy character. On the other hand, it makes no\r\ndifference that the owner be the subject of a neutral non-littoral State\r\nwithout a maritime flag and that the vessel is, therefore, compelled to\r\nfly the flag of a maritime State: if the flag the vessel flies be the\r\nenemy flag, she bears enemy character.\r\n\r\nThe general rule that the flag is the deciding factor has exceptions,\r\nand it is convenient to expound the matter according to the rules of the\r\nDeclaration of London, although it is not yet ratified. The general rule\r\nis laid down by article 57 of the Declaration which enacts that, subject\r\nto the provisions respecting transfer to another flag, the character of\r\na vessel is determined by the flag she is entitled to fly. Nevertheless,\r\nthere are two exceptions to this rule:--\r\n\r\n(1) According to article 46 of the Declaration[150] a neutral\r\nmerchantman acquires enemy character by taking a direct part in the\r\nhostilities, by being in the exclusive employment of the enemy\r\ngovernment, and by being at the time exclusively intended either for the\r\ntransport of troops or for the transmission of intelligence for the\r\nenemy. And it must be emphasised that the act by which a neutral\r\nmerchantman acquires enemy character need not necessarily be committed\r\n_after_ the outbreak of war, for she can, even _before_ the outbreak of\r\nwar, to such a degree identify herself with a foreign State that, with\r\nthe outbreak of war against such State, enemy character devolves upon\r\nher _ipso facto_, unless she severs her connexion with the State\r\nconcerned. This is, for instance, the case of a foreign merchantman\r\nwhich in time of peace has been hired by a State for the transport of\r\ntroops or of war material, and is carrying out her contract in spite of\r\nthe outbreak of war.[151]\r\n\r\n(2) According to article 63 of the Declaration a neutral merchantman\r\nacquires enemy character _ipso facto_ by forcibly resisting the\r\nlegitimate exercise of the right of visitation and capture on the part\r\nof a belligerent cruiser (see details below, § 422).\r\n\r\n(3) According to British practice--adopted by America and\r\nJapan[152]--neutral merchantmen likewise acquire enemy character by\r\nviolating the so-called rule of 1756,[153] in case they engage in time\r\nof war in a trade which the enemy prior to the war reserved exclusively\r\nfor merchantmen sailing under his own flag. The Declaration of London\r\nhas neither rejected nor accepted this rule of 1756, for article 57\r\nstipulates expressly that the case where a neutral vessel is engaged in\r\na trade which is closed in time of peace, remains unsettled. It would,\r\ntherefore, according to article 7 of Convention XII. of the Second Peace\r\nConference, be the task of the proposed International Prize Court to\r\nsettle this point.\r\n\r\nOf whatever kind may be the case of the acquisition of enemy character\r\non the part of a neutral vessel, the following four rules apply to all\r\ncases of such neutral vessels as have acquired enemy character:--(_a_)\r\nall enemy goods on board may now be confiscated, although when they were\r\nfirst shipped the vessels concerned were neutral; (_b_) all goods on\r\nboard will now be presumed to be enemy goods, and the owners of neutral\r\ngoods will have to prove the neutral character of the latter; (_c_) the\r\nstipulations of articles 48 and 49 of the Declaration of London\r\nconcerning the sinking of neutral prizes do not apply, because these\r\nvessels are now enemy vessels; (_d_) no appeal may be brought from the\r\nnational prize courts to the International Prize Court, except with\r\nregard to the one question only, whether the vessel concerned has been\r\njustly considered to have acquired enemy character (see article 4 of\r\nConvention XII. of the Second Hague Peace Conference, concerning the\r\nestablishment of an International Prize Court).\r\n\r\n[Footnote 150: See below, § 410.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 151: The case of the _Kow-shing_ ought here to be mentioned,\r\nalthough it has now lost its former importance:--\r\n\r\nOn July 14, 1894, the _Kow-shing_, a British ship, was hired at Shanghai\r\nby the Chinese Government to serve as a transport for eleven hundred\r\nChinese soldiers and also for arms and ammunition from Tien-tsin to\r\nKorea. She was met on July 25 near the island of Phung-do, in Korean\r\nwaters, by the Japanese fleet; she was signalled to stop, was visited by\r\nsome prize officers, and, as it was apparent that she was a transport\r\nfor Chinese soldiers, she was ordered to follow the Japanese cruiser,\r\n_Naniwa_. But although the British captain of the vessel was ready to\r\ncomply with these orders, the Chinese on board would not allow it.\r\nThereupon the Japanese opened fire and sank the vessel. As formerly\r\nhostilities could be commenced without a previous declaration of war the\r\naction of the Japanese was in accordance with the rules of International\r\nLaw existing at the time. But in consequence of Convention III. of the\r\nSecond Peace Conference which requires a declaration of war before the\r\nopening of hostilities, such action nowadays would not be justifiable.\r\nSee Hall, § 168*; Takahashi, pp. 27-51; Holland, _Studies_, pp.\r\n126-128.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 152: See the case of the _Montara_ in Takahashi, p. 633.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 153: See below, § 289, and Higgins, _War and the Private\r\nCitizen_ (1912), pp. 169-192.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Enemy Character of Goods.]\r\n\r\n§ 90. It is an old customary rule that all goods found on board an enemy\r\nmerchantman are presumed to be enemy goods unless the contrary is proved\r\nby the neutral owners concerned. It is, further, generally recognised\r\nthat the enemy character of goods depends upon the enemy character of\r\ntheir owners. As, however, no universally recognised rules exist as to\r\nthe enemy character of individuals, there are likewise no universally\r\nrecognised rules in existence as to the enemy character of goods.\r\n\r\n(1) Since, according to British and American practice, domicile in enemy\r\ncountry makes an individual bear enemy character, all goods belonging to\r\nindividuals domiciled in enemy country are enemy goods, and all goods\r\nbelonging to individuals not resident in enemy country are not, as a\r\nrule, enemy goods. For this reason, goods belonging to enemy subjects\r\nresiding in neutral countries[154] do not, but goods belonging to\r\nsubjects of neutral States residing in enemy country[155] do bear enemy\r\ncharacter, although they may be the goods of a foreign consul appointed\r\nand residing in enemy country.[156] Further, the goods of such subjects\r\nof the belligerents as are domiciled on each other's territory and are\r\nallowed to remain there after the outbreak of war, acquire enemy\r\ncharacter in the eyes of the belligerent whose subjects they are, but\r\nlose their enemy character in the eyes of the belligerent on whose\r\nterritory they are allowed to remain.[157] Again, the produce of an\r\nestate on enemy territory belonging to a subject of a neutral State who\r\nresides abroad, does bear enemy character, for \"_Nothing[158] can be\r\nmore decided and fixed than the principle ... that the possession of the\r\nsoil does impress upon the owner the character of the country, as far as\r\nthe produce of that plantation is concerned ... whatever the local\r\nresidence of the owner may be_.\" Lastly, all such property of a subject\r\nof a neutral State residing abroad but having a house of trade within\r\nthe enemy country as is concerned in the commercial transactions of such\r\nhouse of trade,[159] likewise bears enemy character, because the owner\r\nof these goods has a \"commercial domicile\" in enemy country.\r\n\r\n(2) On the other hand, according to French practice, the nationality of\r\nthe owner of the goods is exclusively the deciding factor, and it does\r\nnot matter where he resides. Hence only such goods on enemy merchantmen\r\nbear enemy character as belong to subjects of the enemy, whether those\r\nsubjects are residing on enemy or neutral territory; and all such goods\r\non enemy merchantmen as belong to subjects of neutral States do not\r\nbear enemy character, whether those subjects reside on neutral or enemy\r\ncountry.[160]\r\n\r\n(3) The Declaration of London does not purport to decide the\r\ncontroversy, since the Powers represented at the Naval Conference of\r\nLondon could not agree. Whereas Holland, Spain, and Japan approved of\r\nthe British and American practice, Austria-Hungary, Italy, Germany, and\r\nRussia sided with France. For this reason, the Declaration, by articles\r\n58 and 59, only enacts that the enemy character of goods on enemy\r\nvessels is determined by the enemy character of their owner, and that\r\nall goods on enemy vessels are presumed to be enemy goods unless the\r\ncontrary is proved. But the chief question, namely, what is the factor\r\nthat decides the enemy character of an owner, is deliberately left\r\nunanswered. It would, therefore, according to article 7 of Convention\r\nXII., be for the proposed International Prize Court to settle it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 154: The _Postilion_ (1779), Hay & Marriot, 245; the _Danous_\r\n(1802), 4 C.

The question of the transfer of enemy vessels to subjects of\r\nneutral States, either shortly before or during the war, must be\r\nregarded as forming part of the larger question of enemy character, for\r\nthe point to be decided is whether such transfer[161] divests these\r\nvessels of their enemy character. It is obvious that, if this point is\r\nanswered in the affirmative, the owners of enemy vessels can evade the\r\ndanger of having their property seized and confiscated by selling their\r\nvessels to subjects of neutral States. Before the Declaration of London,\r\nwhich is, however, not yet ratified, the maritime Powers had not agreed\r\nupon common rules concerning this subject. According to French[162]\r\npractice no transfer of enemy vessels to neutrals could be recognised,\r\nand a vessel thus transferred retained enemy character; but this\r\nconcerned only transfer after the outbreak of war, any legitimate\r\ntransfer anterior to the outbreak of war did give neutral character to a\r\nvessel. According to British and American practice, on the other hand,\r\nneutral vessels could well be transferred to a neutral flag before or\r\nafter the outbreak of war and lose thereby their enemy character,\r\nprovided that the transfer took place _bona fide_,[163] was not effected\r\neither in a blockaded port[164] or while the vessel was _in\r\ntransitu_,[165] the vendor did not retain an interest in the vessel or\r\ndid not stipulate a right to recover or repurchase the vessel after the\r\nconclusion of the war,[166] and the transfer was not made _in transitu_\r\nin contemplation of war.[167]\r\n\r\nThe Declaration of London offers clear and decisive rules concerning the\r\ntransfer of enemy vessels, making a distinction between the transfer to\r\na neutral flag _before_ and _after_ the outbreak of hostilities:\r\n\r\n(1) According to article 55 of the Declaration, the transfer of an enemy\r\nvessel to a neutral flag, if effected _before_ the outbreak of\r\nhostilities, is _valid_, unless the captor is able to prove that the\r\ntransfer was made in order to avoid capture. However, if the bill of\r\nsale is not on board the transferred vessel, and if the transfer was\r\neffected less than sixty days before the outbreak of hostilities, the\r\ntransfer is presumed to be void, unless the vessel can prove that such\r\ntransfer was not effected in order to avoid capture. To provide\r\ncommerce with a guarantee that a transfer should not easily be treated\r\nas void on the ground that it was effected for the purpose of evading\r\ncapture, it is stipulated that, in case the transfer was effected more\r\nthan thirty days before the outbreak of hostilities, there is an\r\nabsolute presumption of its validity, provided the transfer was\r\nunconditional, complete, and in conformity with the laws of the\r\ncountries concerned, and further, provided that neither the control of,\r\nnor the profits arising from, the employment of the vessels remain in\r\nthe same hands as before the transfer. But even in this case a vessel is\r\nsuspect if the transfer took place less than sixty days before the\r\noutbreak of hostilities, and if her bill of sale is not on board. Hence\r\nshe may be seized and brought into a port of a prize court for\r\ninvestigation, and she cannot claim damages for the capture, even if the\r\nCourt releases her.\r\n\r\n(2) According to article 56 of the Declaration, the transfer of an enemy\r\nvessel to a neutral flag, if effected _after_ the outbreak of\r\nhostilities, is _void_ unless the vessel can prove that the transfer was\r\nnot made in order to avoid capture. And such proof is excluded, and an\r\nabsolute presumption is established that the transfer is void, if the\r\ntransfer has been made in a blockaded port or while the vessel was _in\r\ntransitu_, further, if a right to repurchase or recover the vessel is\r\nreserved to the vendor, and lastly, if the requirements of the Municipal\r\nLaw governing the right to fly the flag under which the vessel is\r\nsailing have not been fulfilled.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 161: See Holland, _Prize Law_, § 19; Hall, § 171; Twiss, II.\r\n§§ 162-163; Phillimore, III. § 386; Boeck, Nos. 178-180; Bonfils, Nos.\r\n1344-1349'1; Dupuis, Nos. 117-129, and _Guerre_, Nos. 62-66.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 162: See Dupuis, No. 97.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 163: The _Vigilantia_ (1798), 1 C.

The subject of the transfer of enemy goods on enemy vessels must\r\nlikewise be considered as forming part of the larger subject of enemy\r\ncharacter, for the question is here also whether such a transfer divests\r\nthese goods of their enemy character. And concerning this question[168]\r\nthere was likewise no unanimous practice in existence among the maritime\r\nStates before the agreement on the Declaration of London. British and\r\nAmerican practice refused to recognise a sale _in transitu_ under any\r\ncircumstances or conditions, if the vessel concerned was captured before\r\nthe neutral buyer had actually taken possession of the transferred\r\ngoods.[169] On the other hand, French practice recognised such a sale\r\n_in transitu_, provided it could be proved that the transaction was made\r\n_bona fide_.[170]\r\n\r\nThe Declaration of London now stipulates, by article 60, that enemy\r\ngoods on board an enemy vessel retain their enemy character until they\r\nreach their destination, notwithstanding any transfer effected after the\r\noutbreak of hostilities while the goods are _in transitu_. Hence if such\r\nenemy vessel is captured before having reached her destination, goods\r\nconsigned to enemy subjects may be confiscated, although they have been\r\nsold _in transitu_ to subjects of neutral States. A special rule is\r\nprovided for the case of the enemy consignee of goods on board an enemy\r\nvessel becoming bankrupt while the goods are _in transitu_. In a number\r\nof countries[171] an unpaid vendor has, in the event of the bankruptcy\r\nof the buyer, a recognised legal right to recover such goods as have\r\nalready become the property of the buyer, but have not yet reached him\r\n(right of stoppage _in transitu_). For this reason, article 60 of the\r\nDeclaration stipulates in the second paragraph, that if, prior to the\r\ncapture, the neutral consignor exercises, on the bankruptcy of the enemy\r\nconsignee, his right of stoppage _in transitu_, the goods regain their\r\nneutral character and may not therefore be confiscated.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 168: See Hall, § 172; Twiss, II. §§ 162 and 163; Phillimore,\r\nIII. §§ 387 and 388; Dupuis, No. 1421, and _Guerre_, Nos. 68-73; Boeck,\r\nNos. 182 and 183.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 169: The _Jan Frederick_ (1804), 5 C.

According to the former practice of the States a condition of war\r\ncould _de facto_ arise either through a declaration of war; or through a\r\nproclamation and manifesto of a State that it considered itself at war\r\nwith another State; or through the committal by one State of certain\r\nhostile acts of force against another State. History presents many\r\ninstances of wars commenced in one of these three ways. Although\r\nGrotius (III. c. 3, § 5) laid down the rule that a declaration of war\r\nis necessary for its commencement, the practice of the States shows that\r\nthis rule was not accepted, and many wars have taken place between the\r\ntime of Grotius and our own without a previous[172] declaration of war.\r\nIndeed many writers,[173] following the example of Grotius, have always\r\nasserted the existence of a rule that a declaration is necessary for the\r\ncommencement of war, but it cannot be denied that until the Second Peace\r\nConference of 1907 such a rule was neither sanctioned by custom nor by a\r\ngeneral treaty of the Powers. Moreover many writers[174] distinctly\r\napproved of the practice of the Powers. This does not mean that in\r\nformer times a State would have been justified in opening hostilities\r\nwithout any preceding conflict. There was, and can be, no greater\r\nviolation of the Law of Nations than for a State to begin hostilities in\r\ntime of peace without previous controversy and without having\r\nendeavoured to settle the conflict by negotiation.[175] But if\r\nnegotiation had been tried without success, a State did not act\r\ntreacherously in case it resorted to hostilities without a declaration\r\nof war, especially after diplomatic intercourse had been broken off. The\r\nrule, adopted by the First Peace Conference of 1899--see article 2 of\r\nthe Conventions for the peaceful settlement of international differences\r\nof 1899 and 1907--which stipulates that, _as far as circumstances\r\nallow_, before the appeal to arms recourse must be had to the good\r\noffices or mediation of friendly Powers, did not essentially alter\r\nmatters, for the formula _as far as circumstances_ _allow_ leaves\r\npractically everything to the discretion of the Power bent on making\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nThe outbreak of war between Russia and Japan in 1904 through Japanese\r\ntorpedo boats attacking Russian men-of-war at Port Arthur before a\r\nformal declaration of war, caused a movement for the establishment of\r\nsome written rules concerning the commencement of war. The Institute of\r\nInternational Law, at its meeting at Ghent in 1906, adopted three\r\nprinciples[176] according to which war should not be commenced without\r\neither a declaration of war or an ultimatum, and in either case a\r\ncertain delay sufficient to ensure against treacherous surprise must be\r\nallowed before the belligerent can have recourse to actual hostilities.\r\nThe Second Peace Conference at the Hague in 1907 took the matter up and\r\nproduced the Convention (III.) relative to the commencement of\r\nhostilities which comprises four articles and has been signed by all the\r\nPowers represented at the Conference, except China and Nicaragua, both\r\nof which, however, acceded later.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 172: See Maurice, _Hostilities without Declaration of War_\r\n(1883).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 173: See, for instance, Vattel, III. § 51; Calvo, IV. § 1907;\r\nBluntschli, § 571; Fiore, III. No. 1274; Heffter, § 120.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 174: See, for instance, Bynkershoek, _Quaestiones juris\r\npublici_, I. c. 2; Klüber, § 238; G. F. Martens, § 267; Twiss, II. § 35:\r\nPhillimore, III. §§ 51-55; Hall, § 123; Ullmann (first edition), § 145;\r\nGareis, § 80.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 175: See above, § 3, where the rule is quoted that no State is\r\nallowed to make use of compulsive means of settling differences before\r\nnegotiation has been tried.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 176: See _Annuaire_, XXI. (1906), p. 283.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Declaration of War.]\r\n\r\n§ 94. According to article 1 of Convention III. hostilities must not\r\ncommence without a previous and unequivocal warning, and one of the\r\nforms which this warning may take is a declaration of war stating the\r\nreasons why the Power concerned has recourse to arms.\r\n\r\nA declaration of war is a communication of one State to another that the\r\ncondition of peace between them has come to an end and a condition of\r\nwar has taken its place. In former times declarations of war used to\r\ntake place under greater or lesser solemnities, but during the last few\r\ncenturies all these formalities have vanished, and a declaration of war\r\nnowadays may take place through a simple communication. The only two\r\nconditions with which, according to article 1, declarations of war must\r\ncomply are, that they must be unmistakable, and that they must state\r\nthe reason for the resort to arms. No delay between the declaration and\r\nthe actual commencement of hostilities is stipulated, and it is,\r\ntherefore, possible for a Power to open hostilities immediately after\r\nthe communication of the declaration of war to the enemy. All the more\r\nis it necessary to emphasise that there could be no greater violation of\r\nthe Law of Nations than that which would be committed by a State which\r\nsent a declaration to another without previously having tried to settle\r\nthe difference concerned by negotiation.\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, the question as to the way in which the\r\ncommunication of the declaration of war is to be made requires\r\nattention. Since there is nowhere a rule expressly formulated according\r\nto which the declaration must be communicated in writing, it might be\r\nasserted that communication by any means, be it by a written document,\r\nby telegraph or by telephone message, or by direct word of mouth, is\r\nadmissible. I believe that such an assertion cannot be supported. The\r\nessential importance of the declaration of war and the fact that\r\naccording to article 1 of Convention III. it must be unmistakable and\r\nmust state the reason for the resort to arms, would seem to require a\r\nwritten document which is to be handed over to the other party by an\r\nenvoy. Further, the fact that article 2 of Convention III. expressly\r\nenacts that the notification of the outbreak of war to neutrals _may\r\neven be made by telegraph_, points the same way, for the conclusion is\r\njustified that the declaration of war stipulated as necessary by article\r\nI may _not_ be made by telegraph. And if a telegraph message is\r\ninadmissible, much more are telephone messages and communications by\r\nword of mouth. Moreover, the practice of the States throughout the last\r\ncenturies has been to hand in a written declaration of war, when any\r\ndeclaration has been made.\r\n\r\nParticular attention must be paid to the fact that, in case of a\r\ndeclaration of war, the war, as between the belligerents, is considered\r\nto have commenced with the date of its declaration, although actual\r\nhostilities may not have been commenced until a much later date. On the\r\nother hand, as regards relations between the belligerents and neutrals,\r\na war is not considered to have commenced until its outbreak has either\r\nbeen notified to the neutrals or has otherwise become unmistakably known\r\nto them. For this reason, article 2 of Convention III. enacts that the\r\nbelligerents must at once after the outbreak of war notify[177] the\r\nneutrals, even if only by telegraph, and that the state of war shall not\r\ntake effect with regard to neutrals until after they have received\r\nnotification, unless it be established beyond doubt that they were in\r\nfact aware of the condition of war.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 177: See below, § 307.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ultimatum.]\r\n\r\n§ 95. The second form which the unequivocal warning, stipulated by\r\narticle 1 of Convention III. as necessary before the commencement of\r\nhostilities, may take is an ultimatum with a conditional declaration of\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nUltimatum[178] is the technical term for a written communication of one\r\nState to another which ends amicable negotiations respecting a\r\ndifference, and formulates, for the last time and categorically, the\r\ndemands to be fulfilled if other measures are to be averted. An\r\nultimatum may be simple or qualified. It is _simple_ in case it does not\r\ninclude an indication of the measures contemplated by the Power sending\r\nit; such measures may be acts of retorsion or reprisals, or hostilities.\r\nIt is _qualified_ if it includes an indication of the measures\r\ncontemplated by the Power sending it, for instance a pacific blockade,\r\noccupation of a certain territory, or war. Now the ultimatum stipulated\r\nby article 1 of Convention III. must be a qualified one, for it must be\r\nso worded that the recipient can have no doubt about the commencement of\r\nwar in case he does not comply with the demands of the ultimatum. For\r\nthis reason, if a State has sent a simple ultimatum to another, or a\r\nqualified ultimatum threatening a measure other than war, it is not, in\r\ncase of non-compliance, justified in at once commencing hostilities\r\nwithout a previous declaration of war. For this reason, Italy sent a\r\ndeclaration of war to Turkey in 1911, although an ultimatum threatening\r\nthe occupation of Tripoli had preceded it.\r\n\r\nNothing is enacted by article 1 of Convention III. concerning the\r\nminimum length of time which an ultimatum must grant before the\r\ncommencement of hostilities; this period may, therefore, be only very\r\nshort, as, for instance, a number of hours. All the more is it necessary\r\nhere likewise to emphasise that there could be no greater violation of\r\nthe Law of Nations than that which would be committed by a State which\r\nsent an ultimatum without previously having tried to settle the\r\ndifference concerned by negotiation.\r\n\r\nIt must be specially observed that the state of war following an\r\nultimatum must likewise be notified to neutrals, for article 2 of\r\nConvention III. applies to this case also. And it must further be\r\nobserved that, for the same reason as in the case of a declaration of\r\nwar, an ultimatum containing a conditional declaration of war must be\r\ncommunicated to the other party by a written document.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 178: See above, § 28.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Initiative hostile Acts of War.]\r\n\r\n§ 96. There is no doubt that, in consequence of Convention III. of the\r\nSecond Peace Conference, the recourse to hostilities without a previous\r\ndeclaration of war or qualified ultimatum is forbidden. But the fact\r\nmust not be overlooked that a war can nevertheless break out without\r\nthese preliminaries. Thus a State might deliberately order hostilities\r\nto be commenced without a previous declaration of war or qualified\r\nultimatum. Further, the armed forces of two States having a grievance\r\nagainst one another might engage in hostilities without having been\r\nauthorised thereto and without the respective Governments ordering them\r\nto desist from further hostilities. Again, acts of force by way of\r\nreprisals or during a pacific blockade or an intervention might be\r\nforcibly resisted by the other party, hostilities breaking out in this\r\nway.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that States which deliberately order the commencement of\r\nhostilities without a previous declaration of war or qualified\r\nultimatum, commit an international delinquency, but they are\r\nnevertheless engaged in war. Further, it is certain that States which\r\nallow themselves to be dragged into a condition of war through\r\nunauthorised hostile acts of their armed forces, commit an international\r\ndelinquency, but they are nevertheless engaged in war. Again, war is\r\nactually in existence if the other party forcibly resists acts of force\r\nundertaken by a State by way of reprisals, or during a pacific blockade\r\nor an intervention. Now in all these and similar cases, although war has\r\nbroken out without a previous declaration or qualified ultimatum, all\r\nthe laws of warfare must find application, for a war is still war in the\r\neyes of International Law even though it has been illegally commenced,\r\nor has automatically arisen from acts of force which were not intended\r\nto be acts of war.\r\n\r\nHowever that may be, article 2 of Convention III. also applies to wars\r\nwhich have broken out without a previous declaration or qualified\r\nultimatum, and the belligerents must without delay send a notification\r\nto neutral Powers so that these may be compelled to fulfil the duties of\r\nneutrality. But, of course, neutral Powers must in this case likewise,\r\neven without notification, fulfil the duties of neutrality if they are\r\nunmistakably aware of the outbreak of war.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nEFFECTS OF THE OUTBREAK OF WAR\r\n\r\n  Vattel, III. § 63--Hall, §§ 124-126--Westlake, II. pp.\r\n  29-32--Lawrence, §§ 143-146--Manning, pp. 163-165--Phillimore,\r\n  III. §§ 67-91--Twiss, II. §§ 41-61--Halleck, I. pp. 526-552, and\r\n  II. pp. 124-140--Taylor, §§ 461-468--Walker, §§ 44-50--Wharton,\r\n  III. §§ 336-337A--Wheaton, §§ 298-319--Moore, V. § 779, and VII.\r\n  §§ 1135-1142--Heffter, §§ 121-123--Lueder in Holtzendorff, IV. pp.\r\n  347-363--Gareis, § 81--Liszt, § 39, V.--Ullmann, § 173--Bonfils,\r\n  Nos. 1044-1065--Despagnet, Nos. 517-519--Pradier-Fodéré, VI.

When war breaks out, even if it be limited to only two members of\r\nthe Family of Nations, nevertheless the whole Family of Nations is\r\nthereby affected, since the rights and duties of neutrality devolve upon\r\nsuch States as are not parties to the war. And the subjects of neutral\r\nStates may feel the consequences of the outbreak of war in many ways.\r\nWar is not only a calamity to the commerce and industry of the whole\r\nworld, but also involves the alteration of the legal position of neutral\r\nmerchantmen on the Open Sea, and of the subjects of neutral States\r\nwithin the boundaries of the belligerents. For the belligerents have the\r\nright of visit, search, and eventually capture of neutral merchantmen on\r\nthe Open Sea, and foreigners who remain within the boundaries of the\r\nbelligerents, although subjects of neutral Powers, acquire in a degree\r\nand to a certain extent enemy character.[179] However, the outbreak of\r\nwar tells chiefly and directly upon the relations between the\r\nbelligerents and their subjects. Yet it would not be correct to maintain\r\nthat all legal relations between the parties thereto and between their\r\nsubjects disappear with the outbreak of war. War is not a condition of\r\nanarchy, indifferent or hostile to law, but a condition recognised and\r\nruled by International Law, although it involves a rupture of peaceful\r\nrelations between the belligerents.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 179: See above, § 88.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rupture of Diplomatic Intercourse and Consular Activity.]\r\n\r\n§ 98. The outbreak of war causes at once the rupture of diplomatic\r\nintercourse between the belligerents, if such rupture has not already\r\ntaken place. The respective diplomatic envoys are recalled and ask for\r\ntheir passports, or receive them without any previous request, but they\r\nenjoy their privileges of inviolability and exterritoriality for the\r\nperiod of time requisite for leaving the country. Consular activity\r\nlikewise comes to an end through the outbreak of war.[180]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 180: See above, vol. I. §§ 413 and 436.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cancellation of Treaties.]\r\n\r\n§ 99. The doctrine was formerly held, and a few writers[181] maintain it\r\neven now, that the outbreak of war _ipso facto_ cancels all treaties\r\npreviously concluded between the belligerents, such treaties only\r\nexcepted as have been concluded especially for the case of war. The vast\r\nmajority of modern writers on International Law have abandoned this\r\nstandpoint,[182] and the opinion is pretty general that war by no means\r\nannuls every treaty. But unanimity as to what treaties are or are not\r\ncancelled by war does not exist. Neither does a uniform practice of the\r\nStates exist, cases having occurred in which States have expressly\r\ndeclared[183] that they considered all treaties annulled through war.\r\nThus the whole question remains as yet unsettled. Nevertheless a\r\nmajority of writers agree on the following points:--\r\n\r\n(1) The outbreak of war cancels all political treaties between the\r\nbelligerents which have not been concluded for the purpose of setting up\r\na permanent condition of things, for instance, treaties of alliance.\r\n\r\n(2) On the other hand, it is obvious that such treaties as have been\r\nespecially concluded for the case of war are not annulled, such as\r\ntreaties in regard to the neutralisation of certain parts of the\r\nterritories of the belligerents.\r\n\r\n(3) Such political and other treaties as have been concluded for the\r\npurpose of setting up a permanent[184] condition of things are not _ipso\r\nfacto_ annulled by the outbreak of war, but nothing prevents the\r\nvictorious party from imposing upon the other party in the treaty of\r\npeace any alterations in, or even the dissolution of, such treaties.\r\n\r\n(4) Such non-political treaties as do not intend to set up a permanent\r\ncondition of things, as treaties of commerce for example, are not _ipso\r\nfacto_ annulled, but the parties may annul them or suspend them\r\naccording to discretion.\r\n\r\n(5) So-called law-making[185] treaties, as the Declaration of Paris for\r\nexample, are not cancelled by the outbreak of war. The same is valid in\r\nregard to all treaties to which a multitude of States are parties, as\r\nthe International Postal Union for example, but the belligerents may\r\nsuspend them, as far as they themselves are concerned, in case the\r\nnecessities of war compel them to do so.[186]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 181: See, for instance, Phillimore, III. § 530, and Twiss, I.\r\n§ 252, in contradistinction to Hall, § 125.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 182: See Jaconnet, _op. cit._ pp. 113-128.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 183: As, for instance, Spain in 1898, at the outbreak of the\r\nwar with the United States of America, see Moore, V. pp. 375-380.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 184: Thus American and English Courts--see the cases of the\r\n_Society for the Propagation of the Gospel_ v. _Town of Newhaven_\r\n(1823), 8 Wheaton 464, and _Sutton_ v. _Sutton_ (1830), 1 Russel &\r\nMylne, 663--have declared that article IX. of the treaty of Nov. 19,\r\n1794, between Great Britain and the United States was not annulled by\r\nthe outbreak of war in 1812. See Moore, V. § 779 and Westlake, II. p.\r\n30; see also the foreign cases discussed by Jaconnet, _op. cit._ pp.\r\n168-179.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 185: See above, vol. I. §§ 18, 492, 555-568_b_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 186: The Institute of International Law is studying the whole\r\nquestion of the effect of war on treaties; see Politis, _l.c._, and\r\nespecially _Annuaire_, XXIV. (1911), pp. 201-213, and 220-221.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Precarious position of Belligerents' subjects on Enemy\r\nTerritory.]\r\n\r\n§ 100. The outbreak of war affects likewise such subjects of the\r\nbelligerents as are at the time within the enemy's territory. In former\r\ntimes they could at once be detained as prisoners of war, and many\r\nStates, therefore, concluded in time of peace special treaties for the\r\ntime of war expressly stipulating a specified period during which their\r\nsubjects should be allowed to leave each other's territory\r\nunmolested.[187] Through the influence of such treaties, which became\r\npretty general during the eighteenth century, it became an international\r\npractice that, as a rule, enemy subjects must be allowed to withdraw\r\nwithin a reasonable period, and no instance of the former rule has\r\noccurred during the nineteenth[188] century. Although some[189] writers\r\neven nowadays maintain that according to strict law the old rule is\r\nstill in force, it may safely[190] be maintained that there is now a\r\ncustomary rule of International Law, according to which all such\r\nsubjects of the enemy as have not according to the Municipal Law of\r\ntheir country to join the armed forces of the enemy must be allowed a\r\nreasonable period for withdrawal. On the other hand, such enemy subjects\r\nas are active or reserve officers, or reservists, and the like, may be\r\nprevented from leaving the country and detained as prisoners of war,\r\nfor the principle of self-preservation must justify belligerents in\r\nrefusing to furnish each other with resources which increase their means\r\nof offence and defence.[191] However that may be, a belligerent need not\r\nallow[192] enemy subjects to remain on his territory, although this is\r\nfrequently done. Thus, during the Crimean War Russian subjects in Great\r\nBritain and France were allowed to remain there, as were likewise\r\nRussians in Japan and Japanese in Russia during the Russo-Japanese War,\r\nand Turks in Italy during the Turco-Italian War. On the other hand,\r\nFrance expelled all Germans during the Franco-German war in 1870; the\r\nformer South African Republics expelled most British subjects when war\r\nbroke out in 1899; Russia, although during the Russo-Japanese War she\r\nallowed Japanese subjects to remain in other parts of her territory,\r\nexpelled them from her provinces in the Far East; and in May 1912, eight\r\nmonths after the outbreak of the Turko-Italian War, Turkey decreed the\r\nexpulsion of all Italians, certain classes excepted. In case a\r\nbelligerent allows the residence of enemy subjects on his territory, he\r\ncan, of course, give the permission under certain conditions only, such\r\nas an oath to abstain from all hostile acts or a promise not to leave a\r\ncertain region, and the like. And it must be especially observed that an\r\nenemy subject who is allowed to stay in the country after the outbreak\r\nof war must not, in case the forces of his home State militarily occupy\r\nthe part of the country inhabited by him, join these forces or assist\r\nthem in any way. If, nevertheless, he does so, he is liable to be\r\npunished for treason[193] by the local Sovereign after the withdrawal of\r\nthe enemy forces.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 187: See a list of such treaties in Hall, § 126, p. 107, note\r\n1.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 188: With regard to the 10,000 Englishmen who were arrested in\r\nFrance by Napoleon at the outbreak of war with England in 1803 and kept\r\nas prisoners of war for many years, it must be borne in mind that\r\nNapoleon did not claim a right to make such civilians prisoners of war\r\nas were at the outbreak of war on French soil. He justified his act as\r\none of reprisals, considering it a violation of the Law of Nations on\r\nthe part of England to begin hostilities by capturing two French\r\nmerchantmen in the Bay of Audierne without a formal declaration of war.\r\nSee Alison, _History of Europe_, V. p. 277, and Bonfils, No. 1052.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 189: See Twiss, II. § 50; Rivier, II. p. 320; Liszt, § 39, V.;\r\nHolland, _Letters upon War and Neutrality_ (1909), p. 39.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 190: See _Land Warfare_, § 12.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 191: See _Land Warfare_, § 13.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 192: See above, vol. I. § 324.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 193: See above, vol. I. § 317, p. 394, where the case of _De\r\nJager_ v. _Attorney General_ is discussed.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Persona standi in judicio_ on Enemy Territory.]\r\n\r\n§ 100_a_. Formerly the rule prevailed everywhere that an enemy subject\r\nhas no _persona standi in judicio_ and is, therefore, _ipso facto_ by\r\nthe outbreak of war, prevented from either taking or defending\r\nproceedings in the Courts. This rule dates from the time when war was\r\nconsidered such a condition between belligerents as justified the\r\ncommitting of hostilities on the part of all subjects of the one\r\nbelligerent against all subjects of the other, and, further, the killing\r\nof all enemy subjects irrespective of sex and age, and, at any rate, the\r\nconfiscation of all private enemy property. War in those times used to\r\nput enemy subjects entirely _ex lege_, and it was only a logical\r\nconsequence from this principle that enemy subjects could not sustain\r\n_persona standi in judicio_. Since the rule that enemy subjects are\r\nentirely _ex lege_ has everywhere vanished, the rule that they may not\r\ntake or defend proceedings in the Courts has in many countries, such as\r\nAustria-Hungary, Germany, Holland, and Italy, likewise vanished. But in\r\nGreat Britain and the United States of America[194] enemy subjects are\r\nstill prevented from taking and defending legal proceedings,[195]\r\nalthough there are six exceptions to the general rule. Firstly, enemy\r\nsubjects who do not bear enemy character because they are resident in\r\nneutral country or have a licence to trade or are allowed[196] to remain\r\nin the country of a belligerent, are therefore permitted to sue and be\r\nsued in British and American Courts. Secondly, if during time of peace a\r\ndefendant obtains an opportunity to plead, and if subsequently war\r\nbreaks out with the country of the plaintiff, the defendant may not\r\nplead that the plaintiff is prevented from suing.[197] Thirdly, if a\r\ncontract was entered into and executed before the war, and if an absent\r\nenemy subject has property within the boundaries of a belligerent, he\r\nmay be sued.[198] Fourthly, a prisoner of war[199] may sue during war on\r\na contract for wages. Fifthly, if the parties, being desirous to obtain\r\na decision on the merits of the case, waive the objection, enemy\r\nsubjects may sue and be sued.[200] Lastly, a petition on the part of a\r\ncreditor who is an enemy subject, to prove a debt under a commission of\r\nbankruptcy must be admitted[201] although the dividend will not be paid\r\ntill after the conclusion of peace.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 194: In strict law also in France.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 195: The leading case is the _Hoop_ (1799), 1 C.

It would seem\r\nthat the American Courts are inclined to drop the rule that an enemy\r\nsubject cannot be sued; see _De Jarnett_ v. _De Giversville_ (1874), 56\r\nMissouri, 440.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 199: _Maria_ v. _Hall_ (1800), 2 B. & P. 236.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 200: _Driefontein Consolidated Gold Mines Co._ v. _Janson_\r\n(1910), 2 Q.B. 419; App. Cas.

But the interpretation of article 23 (_h_)\r\nis controversial, Great Britain and the United States of America--in\r\ncontradistinction to Germany and France--maintaining that the article\r\nhas nothing to do with their Municipal Law but concerns the conduct of\r\narmies in occupied enemy territory.[202]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 202: It is impossible here to discuss the details of this\r\ncontroversy which the third Peace Conference must settle.

Ex. 343, \"It may be that the effect\r\nwould ultimately be to bar the action by reason of the Statute of\r\nLimitations is no answer...\", is not decisive, although Anson,\r\n_Principles of the English Law of Contract_ (11th ed. 1906), p. 122, and\r\nother writers accept it as decisive.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Intercourse, especially Trading, between Subjects of\r\nBelligerents.]\r\n\r\n§ 101. Following Bynkershoek,[204] all British and American writers and\r\ncases, and also some French[205] and German[206] writers assert the\r\nexistence of a rule of International Law that all intercourse, and\r\nespecially trading, is _ipso facto_ by the outbreak of war prohibited\r\nbetween the subjects of the belligerents, unless it is permitted under\r\nthe customs of war, as, for instance, ransom bills, or is allowed under\r\nspecial licences, and that all contracts concluded between the subjects\r\nof the belligerents before the outbreak of war become extinct or\r\nsuspended. On the other hand, most German, French, and Italian writers\r\ndeny the existence of such a rule, but assert the existence of another\r\naccording to which belligerents are empowered to prohibit by special\r\norders all trade between their own and enemy subjects.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 204: _Quaestiones juris publici_, I. c. 3: \"_quamvis autem\r\nnulla specialis sit commerciorum prohibitio ipsa tamen jure belli\r\ncommercia sunt vetita_.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 205: For instance, Pillet, p. 74, and Mérignhac, p. 57.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 206: For instance, Geffcken in his note 4 to Heffter, p. 265.]\r\n\r\nThese assertions are remnants of the time when the distinction[207]\r\nbetween International and Municipal Law was not, or not clearly, drawn.\r\nInternational Law, being a law for the conduct of States only and\r\nexclusively, has nothing to do directly with the conduct of private\r\nindividuals, and both assertions are, therefore, nowadays untenable.\r\nTheir place must be taken by the statement that, States being sovereign\r\nand the outbreak of war bringing the peaceful relations between\r\nbelligerents to an end, it is within the competence of every State to\r\nenact by its Municipal Law such rules as it pleases concerning\r\nintercourse, and especially trading, between its own and enemy subjects.\r\nAnd if we look at the Municipal Laws of the several countries, we find\r\nthat they have to be divided into two groups. To the one group belong\r\nthose States--such as Austria-Hungary, Germany, Holland, and\r\nItaly--whose Governments are empowered by their Municipal Laws to\r\nprohibit by special order all trading with enemy subjects at the\r\noutbreak of war. In these countries trade with enemy subjects is\r\npermitted to continue after the outbreak of war unless special\r\nprohibitive orders are issued. To the other group belong those\r\nStates--such as Great Britain, the United States of America, and, unless\r\n_desuetudo_[208] has made an alteration, France--whose Municipal Laws\r\ndeclare trade and intercourse with enemy subjects _ipso facto_ by the\r\noutbreak of war prohibited, but empowers the Governments to allow by\r\nspecial licences all or certain kinds of such trade.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 207: See above, vol. I. § 20.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 208: See Meyer, _op. cit._ p. 91.]\r\n\r\nAs regards the law of Great Britain[209] and the United States of\r\nAmerica, it has been, since the end of the eighteenth century, an\r\nabsolutely settled[210] rule of the Common Law that, certain cases\r\nexcepted, all trading with alien enemies is _ipso facto_ by the outbreak\r\nof war illegal unless it is allowed by special licences of the Crown.\r\nFrom the general principle asserted in the leading cases,[211] the\r\nCourts have drawn the following more important consequences:--\r\n\r\n(1) All contracts, entered into _during_ a war,[212] with alien enemies\r\nwithout a special licence are illegal, invalid, and can never be\r\nenforced, unless the contract was one entered into in case of\r\nnecessity,[213] or in order to supply[214] an invading English army or\r\nthe English fleet, or by prisoners[215] of war concerning personal\r\nservices and requirements.\r\n\r\n(2) Trading with the enemy does not become legal by the fact that goods\r\ncoming from the enemy country to Great Britain, or going from Great\r\nBritain to the enemy country, are sent to their destination through a\r\nneutral country.[216]\r\n\r\n(3) As regards contracts entered into _before_[217] the outbreak of war,\r\na distinction must be drawn:--(_a_) Executory contracts are avoided,\r\nboth parties being released from performance. (_b_) Contracts executed\r\nbefore the outbreak of war and not requiring to be acted upon during the\r\nwar are suspended until after the conclusion of peace. (_c_) Executed\r\ncontracts which require acting upon during the war are dissolved.\r\n\r\n(4) Partnerships[218] with alien enemies are dissolved.\r\n\r\n(5) No interest runs on debts[219] or mortgages.[220]\r\n\r\n(6) A contract of affreightment[221] must not be fulfilled; therefore\r\nEnglish ships must not load or unload goods in an enemy port.\r\n\r\n(7) Contracts of insurance of enemy vessels and goods are so to be\r\nconstrued as to contain a proviso that the assurance shall not cover any\r\nloss occurring during a war between the country of the assurer and the\r\ncountry of the assured.[222]\r\n\r\n(8) A life insurance policy,[223] entered into before the outbreak of\r\nwar conditioning the payment of yearly premiums on pain of forfeiture of\r\nthe policy, is forfeited _ipso facto_ by the outbreak of war because the\r\npayment of the premium is now prohibited. After the conclusion of peace,\r\nhowever, the insured may claim the equitable value of the policy\r\narising, at the time of the outbreak of war, from the premiums actually\r\npaid.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 209: See besides the English and American text-books quoted\r\nabove at the commencement of § 97, Pennant, Chadwick, and Gregory in\r\n_The Law Quarterly Review_, XVIII.

Since, however, as stated above in § 100_a_, Great Britain and\r\nthe United States of America uphold a different interpretation, this\r\narticle does not concern their Municipal Laws respecting trading with\r\nalien enemies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Position of Belligerents' Property in the Enemy State.]\r\n\r\n§ 102. In former times all private and public enemy property, immoveable\r\nor moveable, on each other's territory could be confiscated by the\r\nbelligerents at the outbreak of war, as could also enemy debts; and the\r\ntreaties[224] concluded between many States with regard to the\r\nwithdrawal of each other's subjects at the outbreak of war stipulated\r\nlikewise the unrestrained withdrawal of the private property of their\r\nsubjects. Through the influence of such treaties as well as of Municipal\r\nLaws and Decrees enacting the same, an international usage and practice\r\ngrew up that belligerents should neither confiscate private enemy\r\nproperty nor annul enemy debts on their territory. The last case of\r\nconfiscation of private property is that of 1793 at the outbreak of war\r\nbetween France and Great Britain. No case of confiscation occurred\r\nduring the nineteenth century, and although several writers maintain\r\nthat according to strict law the old rule, in contradistinction to the\r\nusage which they do not deny, is still valid, it may safely be\r\nmaintained that it is obsolete, and that there is now a customary rule\r\nof International Law in existence prohibiting the confiscation of\r\nprivate enemy property and the annulment of enemy debts on the territory\r\nof a belligerent. This rule, however, does not prevent a belligerent\r\nfrom seizing public enemy property on his territory, such as funds,\r\nammunition, provisions, rolling stock of enemy state-railways, and other\r\nvaluables; from preventing the withdrawal of private enemy property\r\nwhich may be made use of by the enemy[225] for military operations, such\r\nas arms and munitions; from seizing and making use of rolling stock\r\nbelonging to private enemy railway companies, other means of transport\r\nof persons or goods which are private enemy property, and, further, all\r\nappliances for the transmission of news, although they are private enemy\r\nproperty, provided all these articles are restored and indemnities are\r\npaid for them after the conclusion of peace;[226] and from suspending,\r\nas a measure of self preservation, the payment of large enemy debts till\r\nafter the conclusion of peace in order to prevent the increase of\r\nresources of the enemy.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 224: See above, § 100; Moore, VII. § 1196; Scott,\r\n_Conferences_, pp. 559-563.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 225: The indulgence granted to enemy merchantmen in Russian\r\nand Japanese ports at the outbreak of the war in 1904, to leave those\r\nports unmolested within a certain period of time, was conditional upon\r\nthere being no contraband in the cargoes. See Lawrence, _War_, p. 52.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 226: As the seizure of all these articles is, according to\r\narticle 53 of the Hague Regulations, permissible in occupied enemy\r\ncountry, provided they are restored and indemnities paid after the\r\nconclusion of peace, seizure must likewise--under the same\r\nconditions--be permissible in case these articles are on the territory\r\nof a belligerent. As regards rolling stock belonging to private enemy\r\nrailway companies, see Nowacki, _Die Eisenbahnen im Kriege_ (1906), §\r\n15.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effect of the Outbreak of War on Merchantmen.]\r\n\r\n§ 102_a_. In former times International Law empowered States at the\r\noutbreak of war to lay an embargo upon all enemy merchantmen in their\r\nharbours in order to confiscate them. And enemy merchantmen on the sea\r\ncould at the outbreak of war be captured and confiscated although they\r\ndid not even know of the outbreak of war. As regards enemy merchantmen\r\nin the harbours of the belligerents, it became, from the outbreak of the\r\nCrimean War in 1854, a usage, if not a custom, that no embargo[227]\r\ncould be laid on them for the purpose of confiscating them, and that a\r\nreasonable time must be granted them to depart unmolested; but no rule\r\nwas in existence until the Second Peace Conference of 1907 which\r\nprescribed immunity from confiscation for such enemy merchantmen at sea\r\nas did not know of the outbreak of war. This Conference took the matter\r\ninto consideration, and produced a Convention (VI.) relative to the\r\nstatus of enemy merchantmen at the outbreak of hostilities[228] which is\r\nsigned by all the Powers represented at the Conference, except the\r\nUnited States of America,[229] China, and Nicaragua; but Nicaragua\r\nacceded later. In coming to an agreement on the subject, two facts had\r\nto be taken into consideration. There is, firstly, the fact that in all\r\nmaritime countries numerous merchantmen are now built from special\r\ndesigns in order that they may quickly, at the outbreak of or during\r\nwar, be converted into cruisers; it would therefore be folly on the part\r\nof a belligerent to grant any lenient treatment to such vessels. There\r\nis, secondly, the fact, that a belligerent fleet cannot nowadays remain\r\neffective for long without being accompanied by a train of colliers,\r\ntransport vessels, and repairing vessels; it is, therefore, of the\r\ngreatest importance for a belligerent to have as many merchantmen as\r\npossible at his disposal for the purpose of making use of them for such\r\nassistance to the fleet. For this reason, Convention VI. represents a\r\ncompromise, and it distinguishes between vessels in the harbours of the\r\nbelligerents and vessels on the sea. Its provisions are the following:--\r\n\r\n[Footnote 227: See above, § 40.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 228: See Lémonon, pp. 647-661; Higgins, pp. 300-307; Nippold,\r\nII. pp. 146-153; Scott, _Conferences_, pp. 556-568; Dupuis, _Guerre_,\r\nNos. 74-81; Scott in _A.J._ II. (1908), pp. 260-269.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 229: The United States of America refused to sign the\r\nConvention because she considers its stipulations retrogressive as they\r\nare less liberal than the practice which has prevailed since 1854. But\r\ncircumstances have changed since that time, and the two facts explained\r\nin the text would seem to have compelled the maritime Powers to adopt\r\nrules somewhat less liberal. This was the more necessary since no\r\nagreement could be arrived at concerning the question of the locality in\r\nwhich belligerents should be allowed to convert merchantmen into\r\ncruisers.]\r\n\r\n(1) Article 1 of the Convention enacts that, in case an enemy\r\nmerchantman is at the beginning of the war in the port of a belligerent,\r\nit is _desirable_ that she should be allowed freely to depart, either\r\nimmediately or after a sufficient term of grace, and, after being\r\nfurnished with a passport, to proceed either direct to her port of\r\ndestination or to such other port as may be determined. It is obvious\r\nthat, since only the desirability of free departure of such vessels is\r\nstipulated, a belligerent is not compelled to grant free departure;\r\nnevertheless there must be grave reasons for not acting in accordance\r\nwith what is considered desirable by article 1. And it must be specially\r\nobserved that a belligerent may make a distinction in the treatment of\r\nseveral enemy vessels in his harbours, and may grant free departure to\r\none or more of them, and refuse it to others, according to his\r\ndiscretion.\r\n\r\n(2) The former usage that enemy merchantmen in the harbours of the\r\nbelligerents at the outbreak of war may not be confiscated, has been\r\nmade a _binding rule_ by article 2 which enacts that such vessels as\r\nwere not allowed to leave, or were by _force majeure_ prevented from\r\nleaving during the term of grace, may not be confiscated, but may only\r\nbe detained under the obligation that they shall be restored, without\r\nindemnity, after the conclusion of peace, or they may be requisitioned\r\non condition of indemnities to be paid to the owners.\r\n\r\n(3) Enemy merchantmen which have left their last port of departure\r\nbefore the outbreak of war and which, while ignorant of the outbreak of\r\nwar, are met at sea by cruisers of the belligerents, may, according to\r\narticle 3, be captured, but they may not be confiscated, for they must\r\nbe restored after the war is ended, although no indemnities need be\r\npaid. Indemnities are only to be paid in case the vessels have been\r\nrequisitioned or destroyed, for a belligerent is empowered to\r\nrequisition or destroy such vessels provided he takes care to preserve\r\nthe ship papers and makes arrangements for the safety of the persons on\r\nboard.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that, in case such vessels are not ignorant of the\r\noutbreak of war--having, for instance, received the news by wireless\r\ntelegraphy--they may not any longer claim the privileges stipulated by\r\narticle 3. And this article stipulates expressly that after having\r\ntouched a port of their own or of a neutral country, such vessels are no\r\nlonger privileged.\r\n\r\n(4) Enemy goods on board such enemy merchantmen as are in the harbour\r\nof a belligerent at the outbreak of war or at sea and are in ignorance\r\nof the outbreak of war are, according to article 4, privileged to the\r\nsame extent as the vessels concerned.\r\n\r\n(5) Enemy merchantmen whose construction indicates that they are\r\nintended to be converted into cruisers may be seized and confiscated in\r\nthe harbours of the belligerents, as well as at sea, although ignorant\r\nof the outbreak of war, for article 5 stipulates expressly that\r\nConvention VI. does not affect such vessels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nWARFARE ON LAND\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nON LAND WARFARE IN GENERAL\r\n\r\n  Vattel, III. §§ 136-138--Hall, §§ 184-185--Phillimore, III. §\r\n  94--Taylor, § 469--Wheaton, § 342--Bluntschli, §§\r\n  534-535--Heffter, § 125--Lueder in Holtzendorff, IV. pp.\r\n  388-389--Gareis, § 84--Bonfils, Nos. 1066-1067--Pradier-Fodéré,\r\n  VI.

The purpose of war, namely, the overpowering of the enemy, is\r\nserved in land warfare through two aims[230]--firstly, defeat of the\r\nenemy armed forces on land, and, secondly, occupation and administration\r\nof the enemy territory. The chief means by which belligerents try to\r\nrealise those aims, and which are always conclusively decisive, are the\r\ndifferent sorts of force applied against enemy persons. But besides such\r\nviolence against enemy persons there are other means which are not at\r\nall unimportant, although they play a secondary part only. Such means\r\nare: appropriation, utilisation, and destruction of enemy property;\r\nsiege; bombardment; assault; espionage; utilisation of treason; ruses.\r\nAll these means of warfare on land must be discussed in this chapter, as\r\nmust also occupation of enemy territory.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 230: Aims of land warfare must not be confounded with ends of\r\nwar; see above, § 66.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lawful and Unlawful Practices of Land Warfare.]\r\n\r\n§ 104. But--to use the words of article 22 of the Hague\r\nRegulations--\"the belligerents have not an unlimited right as to the\r\nmeans they adopt for injuring the enemy.\" For not all possible practices\r\nof injuring the enemy in offence and defence are lawful, certain\r\npractices being prohibited under all circumstances and conditions, and\r\nother practices being allowed only under certain circumstances and\r\nconditions, or only with certain restrictions. The principles of\r\nchivalry and of humanity have been at work[231] for many hundreds of\r\nyears to create these restrictions, and their work is not yet at an end.\r\nHowever, apart from these restrictions, all kinds and degrees of force\r\nand many other practices may be made use of in war.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 231: See above, § 67.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Objects of the Means of Warfare.]\r\n\r\n§ 105. In a sense all means of warfare are directed against one object\r\nonly--namely, the enemy State, which is to be overpowered by all\r\nlegitimate means. Apart from this, the means of land warfare are\r\ndirected against several objects.[232] Such objects are chiefly the\r\nmembers of the armed forces of the enemy, but likewise, although in a\r\nlesser degree, other enemy persons; further, private and public\r\nproperty, fortresses, and roads. Indeed, apart from certain\r\nrestrictions, everything may eventually be the object of a means of\r\nwarfare, provided the means are legitimate in themselves and are capable\r\nof fostering the realisation of the purpose of war.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 232: See Oppenheim, _Die Objekte des Verbrechens_ (1894), pp.\r\n64-146, where the relation of human actions with their objects is fully\r\ndiscussed.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Land Warfare in contradistinction to Sea Warfare.]\r\n\r\n§ 106. Land warfare must be distinguished from sea warfare chiefly for\r\ntwo reasons. Firstly, their circumstances and conditions differ widely\r\nfrom each other, and, therefore, their means and practices also differ.\r\nSecondly, the law-making Conventions which deal with warfare rarely deal\r\nwith land and sea warfare at the same time, but mostly treat them\r\nseparately, for whereas some Conventions deal exclusively with warfare\r\non sea, the Hague Regulations (Convention IV.) deal exclusively with\r\nwarfare on land.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nVIOLENCE AGAINST ENEMY PERSONS\r\n\r\n  Grotius, III. c. 4--Vattel, III. §§ 139-159--Hall, §§ 128, 129,\r\n  185--Westlake, II. pp. 72-76--Lawrence, §§ 161, 163,\r\n  166-169--Maine, pp. 123-148--Manning, pp. 196-205--Phillimore,\r\n  III. §§ 94-95--Halleck, II. pp. 14-18--Moore, VII. §§ 1111, 1119,\r\n  1122, 1124--Taylor, §§ 477-480--Walker, § 50--Wheaton, §§\r\n  343-345--Bluntschli, §§ 557-563--Heffter, § 126--Lueder in\r\n  Holtzendorff, IV. pp. 390-394--Gareis, § 85--Klüber, § 244--Liszt,\r\n  § 40, III.--G.

As war is a contention between States for the purpose of\r\noverpowering each other, violence consisting of different sorts of force\r\napplied against enemy persons is the chief and decisive means of\r\nwarfare. These different sorts of force are used against combatants as\r\nwell as non-combatants, but with discrimination and differentiation. The\r\npurpose of the application of violence against combatants is their\r\ndisablement so that they can no longer take part in the fighting. And\r\nthis purpose may be realised through either killing or wounding them, or\r\nmaking them prisoners. As regards non-combatant members of armed forces,\r\nprivate enemy persons showing no hostile conduct, and officials in\r\nimportant positions, only minor means of force may as a rule be applied,\r\nsince they do not take part in the armed contention of the belligerents.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Killing and Wounding of Combatants.]\r\n\r\n§ 108. Every combatant may be killed or wounded, whether a private\r\nsoldier or an officer, or even the monarch or a member of his family.\r\nSome publicists[233] assert that it is a usage of warfare not to aim at\r\na sovereign or a member of his family. Be that as it may, there is in\r\nstrict law[234] no rule preventing the killing and wounding of such\r\nillustrious persons. But combatants may only be killed or wounded if\r\nthey are able and willing to fight or to resist capture. Therefore, such\r\ncombatants as are disabled by sickness or wounds may not be killed.\r\nFurther, such combatants as lay down arms and surrender or do not resist\r\nbeing made prisoners may neither be killed nor wounded, but must be\r\ngiven quarter. These rules are universally recognised, and are now\r\nexpressly enacted by article 23 (_c_) of the Hague Regulations, although\r\nthe fury of battle frequently makes individual fighters[235] forget and\r\nneglect them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 233: See Klüber, § 245; G.

However, the rule that quarter must be given has its exceptions.\r\nAlthough it has of late been a customary rule of International Law, and\r\nalthough the Hague Regulations now expressly stipulate by article 23\r\n(_d_) that belligerents are prohibited from declaring that no quarter\r\nwill be given, quarter may nevertheless be refused[236] by way of\r\nreprisal for violations of the rules of warfare committed by the other\r\nside; and, further, in case of imperative necessity, when the granting\r\nof quarter would so encumber a force with prisoners that its own\r\nsecurity would thereby be vitally imperilled.[237] But it must be\r\nemphasised that the mere fact that numerous prisoners cannot safely be\r\nguarded and fed by the captors[238] does not furnish an exceptional\r\ncase to the rule, provided that no vital danger to the captors is\r\ntherein involved. And it must likewise be emphasised that the former\r\nrule is now obsolete according to which quarter could be refused to the\r\ngarrison of a fortress carried by assault, to the defenders of an\r\nunfortified place against an attack of artillery, and to the weak\r\ngarrison who obstinately and uselessly persevered in defending a\r\nfortified place against overwhelming enemy forces.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 236: See Pradier-Fodéré, VII. Nos. 2800-2801, who opposes this\r\nprinciple but discusses the subject in a very detailed way.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 237: See Payrat, _Le Prisonnier de Guerre_ (1910), pp.\r\n191-220, and _Land Warfare_, § 80.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 238: Accordingly, the Boers frequently during the South\r\nAfrican War set free British soldiers whom they had captured.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lawful and Unlawful Means of killing and wounding\r\nCombatants.]\r\n\r\n§ 110. Apart from such means as are expressly prohibited by treaties or\r\ncustom, all means of killing and wounding that exist or may be invented\r\nare lawful. And it matters not whether the means used are directed\r\nagainst single individuals, as swords and rifles, or against large\r\nbodies of individuals, as, for instance, shrapnel, Gatlings, and mines.\r\nOn the other hand, all means are unlawful that render death inevitable\r\nor that needlessly aggravate the sufferings of wounded combatants. A\r\ncustomary rule of International Law, now expressly enacted by article 23\r\n(_e_) of the Hague Regulations, prohibits, therefore, the employment of\r\npoison and of such arms, projectiles, and material as cause unnecessary\r\ninjury. Accordingly: wells, pumps, rivers, and the like from which the\r\nenemy draws drinking water must not be poisoned; poisoned weapons must\r\nnot be made use of; rifles must not be loaded with bits of glass,\r\nirregularly shaped iron, nails, and the like; cannons must not be loaded\r\nwith chain shot, crossbar shot, red-hot balls, and the like. Another\r\ncustomary rule, now likewise enacted by article 23 (_b_) of the Hague\r\nRegulations, prohibits any treacherous way of killing and wounding\r\ncombatants. Accordingly: no assassin must be hired and no assassination\r\nof combatants be committed; a price may not be put on the head of an\r\nenemy individual; proscription and outlawing are prohibited; no\r\ntreacherous request for quarter must be made; no treacherous simulation\r\nof sickness or wounds is permitted.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Explosive Bullets.]\r\n\r\n§ 111. In 1868 a conference met at St. Petersburg for the examination of\r\na proposition made by Russia with regard to the use of explosive\r\nprojectiles in war. The representatives of seventeen Powers--namely,\r\nGreat Britain, Russia, Austria-Hungary, Bavaria, Belgium, Denmark,\r\nFrance, Greece, Holland, Italy, Persia, Portugal, Prussia and the North\r\nGerman Confederation, Sweden-Norway, Switzerland, Turkey and Württemberg\r\n(Brazil acceded later) signed on December 11, 1868, the so-called\r\nDeclaration of St. Petersburg,[239] which stipulates that the signatory\r\nPowers, and those who should accede later, renounce in case of war\r\nbetween themselves the employment, by their military and naval troops,\r\nof any projectile of a weight below 400 grammes (14 ounces) which is\r\neither explosive or charged with fulminating or inflammable substances.\r\nThis engagement is obligatory only upon the contracting Powers, and it\r\nceases to be obligatory in case a non-contracting Power takes part in a\r\nwar between any of the contracting Powers.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 239: See above, vol. I. § 562, and Martens, _N.R.G._ XVIII. p.\r\n474.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Expanding (Dum-Dum) Bullets.]\r\n\r\n§ 112. As Great Britain had introduced bullets manufactured at the\r\nIndian arsenal of Dum-Dum, near Calcutta, the hard jacket of which did\r\nnot quite cover the core and which therefore easily expanded and\r\nflattened in the human body, the First Hague Peace Conference adopted a\r\ndeclaration signed on July 29, 1899, by fifteen Powers--namely, Belgium,\r\nDenmark, Spain, Mexico, France, Greece, Montenegro, Holland, Persia,\r\nRoumania, Russia, Siam, Sweden-Norway, Turkey, and Bulgaria--stipulating\r\nthat the contracting Powers should abstain, in case of war between two\r\nor more of them, from the use of bullets which expand or flatten easily\r\nin the human body, such as bullets with hard envelopes which do not\r\nentirely cover the core or are pierced with incisions. Austria-Hungary,\r\nChina, Germany, Italy, Nicaragua, Portugal, Japan, Luxemburg, Servia,\r\nSwitzerland, and Great Britain acceded later.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Projectiles diffusing Asphyxiating or Deleterious Gases.]\r\n\r\n§ 113. The First Hague Peace Conference also adopted a Declaration,\r\nsigned on July 29, 1899, by sixteen States--namely, Belgium, Denmark,\r\nSpain, Mexico, France, Greece, Montenegro, Holland, Persia, Portugal,\r\nRoumania, Russia, Siam, Sweden-Norway, Turkey and Bulgaria--stipulating\r\nthat the signatory Powers should in a war between two or more of them\r\nabstain from the use of projectiles the sole object of which is the\r\ndiffusion of asphyxiating or deleterious gases. Austria-Hungary, China,\r\nGermany, Italy, Japan, Luxemburg, Nicaragua, Servia, Switzerland, and\r\nGreat Britain acceded later.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Violence directed from Air-Vessels.]\r\n\r\n§ 114. The First Hague Peace Conference adopted likewise a Declaration,\r\nsigned on July 29, 1899, prohibiting _for a term of five years_ the\r\nlaunching of projectiles or explosives from balloons or other kinds of\r\naerial vessels. The Second Peace Conference, on October 18, 1907,\r\nrenewed this Declaration _up to the close of the Third Peace\r\nConference_, but out of twenty-seven States which signed the Declaration\r\nonly seven--namely, Great Britain, the United States of America, China,\r\nHolland, Bolivia, Salvador, Haiti (Nicaragua acceded later)--ratified\r\nit, and Germany, France, Italy, Japan, Russia--not to mention smaller\r\nPowers--did not even sign it. There is, therefore, no doubt that the\r\nThird Peace Conference will not renew the Declaration. Although it is\r\nvery much to be regretted, the fact must be taken into consideration\r\nthat in future violence directed from air-vessels will play a great part\r\nin war. For this reason, the question as to the conditions under which\r\nsuch violence is admissible, is of importance,[240] but it is as yet\r\nimpossible to give a satisfactory answer. The Institute of International\r\nLaw, at its meeting at Madrid in 1911, adopted the principle[241] that\r\n_aerial warfare must not comprise greater danger to the person and the\r\nproperty of the peaceful population than land or sea warfare_. However\r\nthis may be, there can be no doubt that the general principles laid down\r\nin the Declaration of St. Petersburg of 1868, in the two Declarations,\r\nadopted by the First Peace Conference, concerning expanding bullets and\r\nprojectiles diffusing asphyxiating or deleterious gases, in the Hague\r\nrules concerning land warfare, and the like, must find application as\r\nregards violence directed from air vessels.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 240: See, besides the literature quoted above, vol.

It will be remembered from above, § 79, that numerous individuals\r\nbelong to armed forces without being combatants. Now, since and in so\r\nfar as these non-combatant members of armed forces do not take part in\r\nthe fighting, they may not directly be attacked and killed or wounded.\r\nHowever, they are exposed to all injuries indirectly resulting from the\r\noperations of warfare. And, with the exception of the personnel[242]\r\nengaged in the interest of the wounded, such as doctors, chaplains,\r\npersons employed in military hospitals, official ambulance men, who,\r\naccording to articles 9 and 10 of the Geneva Convention, are specially\r\nprivileged, such non-combatant members of armed forces may certainly be\r\nmade prisoners, since the assistance they give to the fighting forces\r\nmay be of great importance.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 242: See below, § 121.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Violence against Private Enemy Persons.]\r\n\r\n§ 116. Whereas in former[243] times private enemy persons of either sex\r\ncould be killed or otherwise badly treated according to discretion, and\r\nwhereas in especial the inhabitants of fortified places taken by assault\r\nused to be abandoned to the mercy of the assailants, in the eighteenth\r\ncentury it became a universally recognised customary rule of the Law of\r\nNations that private enemy individuals should not be killed or attacked.\r\nIn so far as they do not take part in the fighting, they may not be\r\ndirectly attacked and killed or wounded. They are, however, like\r\nnon-combatant members of the armed forces, exposed to all injuries\r\nindirectly resulting from the operations of warfare. Thus, for instance,\r\nwhen a town is bombarded and thousands of inhabitants are thereby\r\nkilled, or when a train carrying private individuals as well as soldiers\r\nis wrecked by a mine, no violation of the rule prohibiting attack on\r\nprivate enemy persons has taken place.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 243: See Grotius, III. c. 4, §§ VI. and IX.]\r\n\r\nAs regards captivity, the rule is that private enemy persons may not be\r\nmade prisoners of war. But this rule has exceptions conditioned by the\r\ncarrying out of certain military operations, the safety of the armed\r\nforces, and the order and tranquillity of occupied enemy territory.\r\nThus, for instance, influential enemy citizens who try to incite their\r\nfellow-citizens to take up arms may be arrested and deported into\r\ncaptivity. And even the whole population of a province may be imprisoned\r\nin case a levy _en masse_ is threatening.[244]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 244: Civilians who render assistance to the enemy as drivers,\r\nor as labourers to construct fortifications or siege works, or in a\r\nsimilar way, if captured while they are so engaged, may not be detained\r\nas prisoners of war, whether they render these services voluntarily or\r\nare requisitioned or hired. See _Land Warfare_, § 58 note (_a_).]\r\n\r\nApart from captivity, restrictions of all sorts may be imposed upon, and\r\nmeans of force may be applied against, private enemy persons for many\r\npurposes. Such purposes are:--the keeping of order and tranquillity on\r\noccupied enemy territory; the prevention of any hostile conduct,\r\nespecially conspiracies; the prevention of intercourse with and\r\nassistance to the enemy forces; the securing of the fulfilment of\r\ncommands and requests of the military authorities, such as those for the\r\nprovision of drivers, hostages, farriers; the securing of compliance\r\nwith requisitions and contributions, of the execution of public works\r\nnecessary for military operations, such as the building of\r\nfortifications, roads, bridges, soldiers' quarters, and the like. What\r\nkind of violent means may be applied for these purposes is in the\r\ndiscretion of the respective military authorities, who on their part\r\nwill act according to expediency and the rules of martial law\r\nestablished by the belligerents. But there is no doubt that, if\r\nnecessary, capital punishment and imprisonment[245] are lawful means for\r\nthese purposes. The essence of the position of private individuals in\r\nmodern warfare with regard to violence against them finds expression in\r\narticle 46 of the Hague Regulations, which lays down the rule that\r\n\"family honours and rights, individual lives and private property, as\r\nwell as religious convictions and liberty, must be respected.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 245: That in case of general devastation the peaceful\r\npopulation may be detained in so-called concentration camps, there is no\r\ndoubt; see below, § 154. And there is likewise no doubt that hostages\r\nmay be taken from the peaceful population; see below, § 170, p. 213, and\r\n§ 259, p. 319, note 2.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Violence against the Head of the Enemy State and against\r\nOfficials in Important Positions.]\r\n\r\n§ 117. The head of the enemy State and officials in important posts, in\r\ncase they do not belong to the armed forces, occupy, so far as their\r\nliability to direct attack, death, or wounds is concerned, a position\r\nsimilar to that of private enemy persons. But they are so important to\r\nthe enemy State, and they may be so useful to the enemy and so dangerous\r\nto the invading forces, that they may certainly be made prisoners of\r\nwar. If a belligerent succeeds in obtaining possession of the head of\r\nthe enemy State or its Cabinet Ministers, he will certainly remove them\r\ninto captivity. And he may do the same with diplomatic agents and other\r\nofficials of importance, because by weakening the enemy Government he\r\nmay thereby influence the enemy to agree to terms of peace.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTREATMENT OF WOUNDED, AND DEAD BODIES\r\n\r\n  Hall, § 130--Lawrence, § 165--Maine, pp. 156-159--Manning, p.\r\n  205--Phillimore, III. § 95--Halleck, II. pp. 36-39--Moore, VII. §\r\n  1134--Taylor, §§ 527-528--Bluntschli, §§ 586-592--Lueder in\r\n  Holtzendorff, IV. pp. 289-319, 398-421--Liszt, § 40, V.--Ullmann,\r\n  § 178 and in _R.G._ IV.

Although[246] since the seventeenth century several hundreds of\r\nspecial treaties have been concluded between different States regarding\r\nthe tending of each other's wounded and the exemption of army surgeons\r\nfrom captivity, no general rule of the Law of Nations on these points\r\nwas in existence until the second half of the nineteenth century other\r\nthan one prohibiting the killing, mutilation, or ill-treatment of the\r\nwounded. A change for the better was initiated by Jean Henry Dunant, a\r\nSwiss citizen from Geneva, who was an eye-witness of the battle of\r\nSolferino in 1859, where many thousands of wounded died who could, under\r\nmore favourable circumstances, have been saved. When he published, in\r\n1861 and 1863, his pamphlet, _Un Souvenir de Solférino_, the Geneva\r\n_Société d'utilité publique_, under the presidency of Gustave Moynier,\r\ncreated an agitation in favour of better arrangements for the tending of\r\nthe wounded on the battlefield, and convoked an international congress\r\nat Geneva in 1863, where thirty-six representatives of nearly all the\r\nEuropean States met and discussed the matter. In 1864 the Bundesrath,\r\nthe Government of the Federal State of Switzerland, took the matter in\r\nhand officially, and invited all European and several American States to\r\nsend official representatives to a Congress at Geneva for the purpose of\r\ndiscussing and concluding an international treaty regarding the wounded.\r\nThis Congress met in 1864, and sixteen States were represented. Its\r\nresult was the international \"Convention[247] for the Amelioration of\r\nthe Condition of Soldiers wounded in Armies in the Field,\" commonly\r\ncalled \"Geneva Convention,\" signed on August 22, 1864. By-and-by States\r\nother than the original signatories joined the Convention, and finally\r\nthe whole body of the civilised States of the world, with the exception\r\nof Costa Rica, Monaco, and Lichtenstein, became parties. That the rules\r\nof the Convention were in no wise perfect, and needed to be supplemented\r\nregarding many points, soon became apparent. A second International\r\nCongress met at the invitation of Switzerland in 1868 at Geneva, where\r\nadditional articles[248] to the original Convention were discussed and\r\nsigned. These additional articles have, however, never been ratified.\r\nThe First Hague Peace Conference in 1899 unanimously formulated the wish\r\nthat Switzerland should shortly take steps for the assemblage of another\r\ninternational congress in order to revise the Geneva Convention. This\r\nCongress assembled in June 1906, thirty-five States having sent\r\nrepresentatives, and on July 6, 1906, a new Geneva Convention[249] was\r\nsigned by Great Britain, Germany, Argentina, Austria-Hungary, Belgium,\r\nBulgaria, Chili, China, Congo Free State, Korea, Denmark, Spain, the\r\nUnited States of America, Brazil, Mexico, France, Greece, Guatemala,\r\nHonduras, Italy, Japan, Luxemburg, Montenegro, Norway, Holland, Peru,\r\nPersia, Portugal, Roumania, Russia, Servia, Siam, Sweden, Switzerland,\r\nand Uruguay. Most of these States have already ratified, and Colombia,\r\nCosta-Rica, Cuba, Nicaragua, Salvador, Turkey, and Venezuela, which were\r\nnot represented at the Congress, acceded later. There is no doubt that\r\nin time all the civilised Powers will become parties.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 246: See Macpherson, _loc. cit._ p. 254.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 247: See Martens, _N.R.G._ XVIII. p. 607, and above, vol. I. §\r\n560.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 248: See Martens, _N.R.G._ XVIII. p. 61.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 249: See Martens, _N.R.G._ 3rd. Ser. II. (1910), p. 620, and\r\n_Treaty Series_, 1907, No. 15.]\r\n\r\nThe new Convention consists of thirty-three articles instead of the ten\r\narticles of the old Convention, and provides rules for the treatment of\r\nthe wounded and the dead; further rules concerning military hospitals\r\nand mobile medical units; the personnel engaged in the interest of the\r\nwounded including army chaplains; the material belonging to mobile\r\nmedical units, military hospitals, and voluntary aid societies; the\r\nconvoys of evacuation; the distinctive emblem; the carrying out of the\r\nConvention; and the prevention of abuses and infractions.\r\n\r\nIn the final protocol the Conference expresses the desire that, in order\r\nto arrive at a unanimous interpretation of the Convention, the parties\r\nshould, so far as the cases and the circumstances permit, submit to\r\nHague Court Arbitration any differences which _in time of peace_ might\r\narise between them concerning the interpretation of the Convention, but\r\nGreat Britain and Japan refused to become parties to this.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Wounded and the Sick.]\r\n\r\n§ 119. According to articles 1-5 of the Geneva Convention,[250] the sick\r\nand wounded persons belonging, or officially attached, to armies must be\r\nrespected and taken care of, without distinction of nationality, by the\r\nbelligerent in whose power they may be. Should, however, a belligerent\r\nnecessarily be compelled to abandon such sick and wounded persons to the\r\nenemy, he must, so far as military exigencies permit, leave behind with\r\nthem a portion of his medical personnel to take care of them, and the\r\nnecessary material. The sick and wounded who have fallen into the hands\r\nof the enemy are prisoners of war, but belligerents may exchange or\r\nrelease them, or even hand them over to a neutral State which has to\r\nintern them until after the conclusion of peace. After each engagement\r\nthe commander in possession of the field must have search made for the\r\nwounded and must take measures to protect them against pillage and\r\nmaltreatment. A nominal roll of all wounded and sick who have been\r\ncollected must be sent as early as possible to the authorities of the\r\ncountry or army to which they belong, and the belligerents must keep\r\neach other mutually informed of any internments and changes as well as\r\nof admissions into hospital. It is specially stipulated by article 5\r\nthat, if a military authority finds it necessary to appeal to the\r\ncharitable zeal of the inhabitants to collect and take care of, under\r\nhis direction, the wounded and sick of armies, he can grant to those\r\nwho have responded to his appeal special protection and certain\r\nimmunities.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 250: The stipulations of the Geneva Convention are for the\r\nmost part of a technical military character, and it is, therefore,\r\nimpossible in a general treatise of International Law to enter into any\r\ndetails. Readers who take a deeper interest in the matter must be\r\nreferred to the most valuable article by Macpherson in _Z.V._ V. (1911),\r\npp. 253-277.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Medical Units and Establishments, and Material.]\r\n\r\n§ 120. In order that the wounded and sick may receive proper treatment,\r\nmobile medical units as well as the fixed establishments of the medical\r\nservice must be respected and protected by the belligerents, but this\r\nprotection ceases if these units and establishments are made use of to\r\ncommit acts harmful to the enemy, for instance, to shelter combatants,\r\nto carry on espionage, to conceal arms and ammunition (articles 6 and\r\n7). But article 8 expressly enacts that the units and establishments do\r\nnot forego protection:--(_a_) in case the personnel is armed and use\r\ntheir arms for their own defence or for the defence of the wounded and\r\nsick under their charge; (_b_) in case, in default of armed orderlies,\r\nunits or establishments are guarded by pickets or by sentinels furnished\r\nwith authority in due form; (_c_) in case weapons and cartridges, taken\r\nfrom the wounded and not yet handed over to the proper department, are\r\nfound in units or establishments.\r\n\r\nAs regards the _material_, a distinction is drawn between the treatment\r\nof the material of mobile medical units, of fixed medical\r\nestablishments, and of material belonging to Voluntary Aid Societies.\r\n\r\n(_a_) Mobile medical units which fall into the hands of the enemy must\r\nnot be deprived of their material, including their teams, whatever may\r\nbe the means of transport and whoever may be the drivers employed\r\n(article 14). The competent military authority is, however, permitted to\r\nmake use of the material in captured medical units for the treatment of\r\nthe wounded and the sick at hand, provided it is restored under the same\r\nconditions, and so far as possible at the same time, as laid down for\r\nthe release of the medical personnel by article 12.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The buildings and material of fixed medical establishments which,\r\nbecause the locality where they are is militarily occupied, fall into\r\nthe hands of the enemy, remain, according to article 15, \"subject to the\r\nlaws of war,\" that means they remain entirely in the power of the\r\ncaptor, but they may not be diverted from their medical purpose so long\r\nas they are necessary for the proper treatment of the wounded and the\r\nsick. Should, however, urgent military necessity demand it, a commander\r\nmay dispose of them, provided he makes previous arrangements for the\r\nwelfare of the wounded and sick found in the fixed establishments.\r\n\r\n(_c_) The material of Voluntary Aid Societies, which are duly\r\nrecognised, is, according to article 16, considered private property and\r\nmust, therefore, be respected as such under all circumstances, although\r\nit may be requisitioned.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Personnel.]\r\n\r\n§ 121. The personnel engaged exclusively in the collection, transport,\r\nand treatment of the wounded and sick, as well as in the administration\r\nof mobile medical units and establishments, the chaplains attached to\r\narmies, and, lastly, pickets and sentinels guarding medical units and\r\nestablishments, must, according to article 9, under all circumstances be\r\nrespected and protected. If they fall into the hands of the enemy they\r\nmust not be treated as prisoners of war. According to article 12,\r\nhowever, they are not free to act or move without let or hindrance, for,\r\nif their assistance is indispensable, they may be called upon by the\r\ncaptor to carry on their duties to the wounded and the sick. But when\r\ntheir assistance is no longer indispensable, they must be sent back to\r\ntheir army or to their country at such time and by such route as may be\r\ncompatible with military exigencies, and they must be allowed to take\r\nwith them such effects, instruments, arms, and horses as are their\r\nprivate property. So long as they are detained by the enemy he must,\r\naccording to article 13, grant them the same allowances and the same pay\r\nas are due to the personnel holding the same rank in his own army.\r\n\r\nThe personnel of Voluntary Aid Societies employed in the medical units\r\nand establishments is, according to article 10, privileged to the same\r\nextent as the official personnel, provided that the Voluntary Aid\r\nSociety concerned is duly recognised and authorised by its Government\r\nand that the personnel of the Society is subject to military law and\r\nregulations. Each State must notify to the other, either in time of\r\npeace or at the commencement, or during the course, of hostilities, but\r\nin every case before actually employing them, the names of societies\r\nwhich it has authorised to render assistance to the regular medical\r\nservice of its armies. A recognised Voluntary Aid Society of a _neutral_\r\ncountry cannot, according to article 11, afford the assistance of its\r\npersonnel and units to a belligerent unless it has previously received\r\nthe consent of its own Government and of the belligerent concerned. And\r\na belligerent who accepts such assistance from a Voluntary Aid Society\r\nof a neutral country is bound, before making any use of it, to notify\r\nthe fact to the enemy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Convoys of Evacuation.]\r\n\r\n§ 122. Convoys used for evacuating the wounded and sick must, as regards\r\ntheir personnel and material, be treated in the same way as mobile\r\nmedical units, but subject to the following special provisions enacted\r\nby article 17:--\r\n\r\nA belligerent intercepting a convoy may, if military exigencies demand,\r\nbreak it up, provided he takes charge of the sick and wounded who are in\r\nit. In this case, the obligation to send back the medical personnel,\r\nprovided for in article 12, must be extended to the whole of the\r\nmilitary personnel detailed for the transport or the protection of the\r\nconvoy and furnished with an authority in due form to that effect.\r\n\r\nThe obligation to restore the medical material, provided for in article\r\n14, must apply to railway trains and boats used in internal navigation,\r\nwhich are specially arranged for evacuation, as well as to the material\r\nbelonging to the medical service for fitting up ordinary vehicles,\r\ntrains, and boats. Military vehicles, other than those of the medical\r\nservice, however, may be captured with their teams; and the civilian\r\npersonnel and the various means of transport obtained by requisition,\r\nincluding railway material and boats used for convoys, are subject to\r\nthe general rules of International Law concerning war.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Distinctive Emblem.]\r\n\r\n§ 123. According to article 18 the Swiss heraldic device of the red\r\ncross on a white ground, formed by reversing the federal colours, is\r\nadopted as the emblem and distinctive sign of the medical service of\r\narmies, but there is no objection to the adoption of another emblem on\r\nthe part of such non-Christian States as object to the cross on\r\nreligious grounds. Thus Turkey has substituted a red crescent, and\r\nPersia a red sun for the cross.[251] The following are the rules\r\nconcerning the use of this emblem:--\r\n\r\n(1) The emblem must be shown on the flags and the armlets (_brassards_)\r\nas well as on all the material belonging to the medical service, but the\r\nemblem cannot be recognised unless it is used with the permission of the\r\ncompetent military authority (article 19).\r\n\r\n(2) Medical units and establishments must hoist the red cross flag\r\naccompanied by the national flag of the belligerent concerned (article\r\n21), but medical units which have fallen into the hands of the enemy\r\nmust not, so long as they are in that situation, fly any other flag than\r\nthat of the red cross. The medical units belonging to neutral countries\r\nwhich have, in accordance with article 11, been admitted to afford their\r\nservices, must fly, along with the red cross flag, the national flag of\r\nthe belligerent to whose army they are attached (article 22).\r\n\r\n(3) All the personnel must, according to article 20, wear, fixed to the\r\nleft arm, an armlet (_brassard_) with a red cross on a white ground,\r\ndelivered and stamped by the competent military authority and\r\naccompanied by a certificate of identity in the case of persons who are\r\nattached to the medical service and armies without wearing the military\r\nuniform.\r\n\r\n(4) The employment of the red cross on a white ground and the words \"Red\r\nCross\" or \"Geneva Cross\" must not, according to article 23, be used,\r\neither in time of peace or in time of war, except to indicate the\r\nprotected medical units, establishments, personnel, and material.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 251: See below, § 207.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Treatment of the Dead.]\r\n\r\n§ 124. According to a customary rule of the Law of Nations belligerents\r\nhave the right to demand from one another that dead soldiers shall not\r\nbe disgracefully treated, especially not mutilated, and shall be, so far\r\nas possible, collected and buried[252] or cremated on the battlefield by\r\nthe victor. The Geneva Convention does not stipulate any rule concerning\r\nthe collection and burial or cremation of the dead, but article 3 enacts\r\nthat after each engagement the commander in possession of the field must\r\ntake measures to ensure protection of the dead against pillage and\r\nmaltreatment, and that a careful examination of the bodies, in order to\r\nsee that life is really extinct, must be made before the dead are buried\r\nor cremated. Each belligerent must send as soon as possible to the\r\nauthorities of the country or army to which they belong the military\r\nidentification marks or tokens found on the dead (article 4). Pieces of\r\nequipment found upon the dead of the enemy are public enemy property and\r\nmay, therefore, be appropriated as booty[253] by the victor. On the\r\nother hand, letters, money, jewellery, and such other articles of value\r\nfound upon the dead on the battlefield, or on those who die in the\r\nmedical units or fixed establishments, as are apparently private\r\nproperty, are not booty, but must, according to article 4 of the Geneva\r\nConvention and article 14 of the Hague rules concerning warfare on land,\r\nbe collected and handed over to the Bureau of Information[254]\r\nconcerning the prisoners of war, which has to transmit them to the\r\npersons interested through the channel of the authorities of their own\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 252: See Grotius, II. c. 19, §§ 1 and 3.

The provisions of the Geneva Convention are only binding in\r\nthe case of war between two or more of the contracting parties, they\r\ncease to be binding from the moment when one of the belligerent Powers\r\nis not a party (article 24). The commanders-in-chief of the belligerent\r\narmies must, in accordance with the instructions of their Governments\r\nand in conformity with the general principles of the Geneva Convention,\r\narrange the details for carrying out the articles of the Geneva\r\nConvention, as well as for cases not provided for in these articles\r\n(article 25). The contracting parties must take the necessary measures\r\nto instruct their troops, especially the personnel protected by the\r\nGeneva Convention, in the provisions of the Convention, and to bring\r\nthese provisions to the notice of the civil population (article 26). In\r\ncountries whose legislation is not at the time of the signing of the\r\nConvention adequate for the purpose, the contracting parties must adopt\r\nsuch measures as may be necessary to prevent, at all times, the\r\nemployment of the emblem or the name of \"Red Cross\" or \"Geneva Cross\"\r\nby private individuals or by Societies other than those which are\r\nentitled to do so according to the Geneva Convention, and in particular\r\nfor commercial purposes as a trade mark or trading mark (article 27).\r\nThe contracting Governments must likewise adopt measures necessary for\r\nthe repression in time of war of individual acts of pillage and\r\nmaltreatment of the wounded and sick, as well as for the punishment of\r\nthe improper use of the Red Cross flag and armlet (_brassard_) by\r\nofficers and soldiers or private individuals not protected by the Geneva\r\nConvention. They must, at the latest within five years from the\r\nratification of the Geneva Convention, communicate to one another\r\nthrough the Swiss Federal Council, the provisions concerning these\r\nmeasures of repression (article 28).[255]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 255: By reason of the uncertainties of parliamentary\r\nproceedings, Great Britain, in signing and ratifying the Geneva\r\nConvention, entered a reservation against articles 23, 27, and 28, but\r\nby the Geneva Convention Act, 1911 (1 & 2 Geo. V. ch. 20), Great Britain\r\nis now able to carry out the stipulations of these three articles.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General provisions of the Geneva Convention.]\r\n\r\n§ 124_b_. The Geneva Convention comes into force for each contracting\r\nPower six months after the date of the deposit of its ratification\r\n(article 30). The new Geneva Convention replaces the old of 1864, but\r\nthe old Geneva Convention remains in force between such of its\r\ncontracting parties as do not become parties to the new Convention of\r\n1906 (article 31). Such of the Powers as signed the old Convention of\r\n1864, but did not sign the new Convention of December 31, 1906, are free\r\nto accede to it at any time later by means of a written notification to\r\nthe Swiss Federal Council. Other Powers may likewise notify their\r\naccession at any time to the Swiss Federal Council, but their accession\r\nonly takes effect in case, within a period of one year from such\r\nnotification, no objection to the accession reaches the Swiss Federal\r\nCouncil from any of the previous contracting Powers (article 32). Each\r\nof the contracting Powers is at liberty at any time to denounce the\r\nGeneva Convention by a written notification to the Swiss Federal\r\nCouncil, which must immediately indicate it to all the other contracting\r\nPowers (article 33). The denunciation, however, does not take effect\r\nuntil one year after it has come to the notice of the Swiss Federal\r\nCouncil, and a denunciation only affects such Power as has notified it.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nCAPTIVITY\r\n\r\n  Grotius, III. c. 14--Bynkershoek, _Quaest. jur. publ._ I. c.\r\n  3--Vattel, III. §§ 148-154--Hall, §§ 131-134--Westlake, II. pp.\r\n  63-68--Lawrence, § 164--Maine, pp. 160-167--Manning, pp.\r\n  210-222--Phillimore, III. § 95--Twiss, II. § 177--Halleck, II. pp.\r\n  19-30--Taylor, §§ 519-524--Moore, VII. §§ 1127-1133--Wharton, III.\r\n  §§ 348-348D--Wheaton, § 344--Bluntschli, §§ 593-626--Heffter, §§\r\n  127-129--Lueder in Holtzendorff, IV. pp. 423-445--Ullmann, §\r\n  177--Bonfils, Nos. 1119-1140--Despagnet, Nos.\r\n  544-550--Pradier-Fodéré, VII.

During antiquity, prisoners of war could be killed, and they were\r\nvery often at once actually butchered or offered as sacrifices to the\r\ngods. If they were spared, they were as a rule made slaves and only\r\nexceptionally liberated. But belligerents also exchanged their prisoners\r\nor liberated them for ransom. During the first part of the Middle Ages\r\nprisoners of war could likewise be killed or made slaves. Under the\r\ninfluence of Christianity, however, their fate in time became mitigated.\r\nAlthough they were often most cruelly treated during the second part of\r\nthe Middle Ages, they were not as a rule killed and, with the\r\ndisappearance of slavery in Europe, they were no longer enslaved. By the\r\ntime modern International Law gradually came into existence, killing and\r\nenslaving prisoners of war had disappeared, but they were still often\r\ntreated as criminals and as objects of personal revenge. They were not\r\nconsidered in the power of the State by whose forces they were captured,\r\nbut in the power of those very forces or of the individual soldiers that\r\nhad made the capture. And it was considered lawful on the part of\r\ncaptors to make as much profit as possible out of their prisoners by way\r\nof ransom, provided no exchange of prisoners took place. So general was\r\nthis practice that a more or less definite scale of ransom became usual.\r\nThus, Grotius (III. c. 14, § 9) mentions that in his time the ransom of\r\na private was the amount of his one month's pay. And since the pecuniary\r\nvalue of a prisoner as regards ransom rose in proportion with his\r\nfortune and his position in life and in the enemy army, it became usual\r\nfor prisoners of rank and note not to belong to the capturing forces but\r\nto the Sovereign, who had, however, to recompense the captors. During\r\nthe seventeenth century, the custom that prisoners were considered in\r\nthe power of their captors died away. They were now considered to be in\r\nthe power of the Sovereign by whose forces they were captured. But rules\r\nof the Law of Nations regarding their proper treatment were hardly in\r\nexistence. The practice of liberating prisoners in exchange, or for\r\nransom only, continued. Special cartels were often concluded at the\r\noutbreak of or during a war for the purpose of stipulating a scale of\r\nransom according to which either belligerent could redeem his soldiers\r\nand officers from captivity. The last[256] instance of such cartels is\r\nthat between England and France in 1780, stipulating the ransom for\r\nmembers of the naval and military forces of both belligerents.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 256: See Hall, § 134, p. 428, note 1.]\r\n\r\nIt was not until the eighteenth century, with its general tendencies to\r\nmitigate the cruel practices of warfare, that matters changed for the\r\nbetter. The conviction in time became general that captivity should only\r\nbe the means of preventing prisoners from returning to their corps and\r\ntaking up arms again, and should, as a matter of principle, be\r\ndistinguished from imprisonment as a punishment for crimes. The Treaty\r\nof Friendship[257] concluded in 1785 between Prussia and the United\r\nStates of America was probably the first to stipulate (article 24) the\r\nproper treatment of prisoners of war, prohibiting confinement in convict\r\nprisons and the use of irons, and insisting upon their confinement in a\r\nhealthy place, where they may have exercise, and where they may be kept\r\nand fed as troops. During the nineteenth century the principle that\r\nprisoners of war should be treated by their captor in a manner analogous\r\nto that meted out to his own troops became generally recognised, and the\r\nHague Regulations have now, by articles 4 to 20, enacted exhaustive\r\nrules regarding captivity.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 257: See Martens, _N.R._ IV. p. 37.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Treatment of Prisoners of War.]\r\n\r\n§ 126. According to articles 4-7 and 16-19 of the Hague Regulations\r\nprisoners of war are not in the power of the individuals or corps who\r\ncapture them, but in the power of the Government of the captor. They\r\nmust be humanely treated. All their personal belongings remain their\r\nproperty, with the exception of arms, horses, and military papers, which\r\nare booty;[258] and in practice[259] personal belongings are understood\r\nto include military uniform, clothing, and kit required for personal\r\nuse, although technically they are Government property. They may only be\r\nimprisoned as an unavoidable matter of safety, and only while the\r\ncircumstances which necessitate the measure continue to exist. They may,\r\ntherefore, be detained in a town, fortress, camp, or any other locality,\r\nand they may be bound not to go beyond a certain fixed boundary. But\r\nthey may not be kept in convict prisons. Except in the case of officers,\r\ntheir labour may be utilised by the Government according to their rank\r\nand aptitude, but their tasks must not be excessive and must have\r\nnothing to do with military operations. Work done by them for the State\r\nmust be paid for in accordance with tariffs in force for soldiers of the\r\nnational army employed on similar tasks, or, in case there are no such\r\ntariffs in force, at rates proportional to the work executed. But\r\nprisoners of war may also be authorised to work for other branches of\r\nthe public service or for private persons under conditions of employment\r\nto be settled by the military authorities, and they may likewise be\r\nauthorised to work on their own account. All wages they receive go\r\ntowards improving their position, and a balance must be paid to them at\r\nthe time of their release, after deducting the cost of their\r\nmaintenance. But whether they earn wages or not, the Government is bound\r\nunder all circumstances to maintain them, and provide quarters, food,\r\nand clothing for them on the same footing as for its own troops. Officer\r\nprisoners must receive the same pay as officers of corresponding rank in\r\nthe country where they are detained, the amount to be repaid by their\r\nGovernment after the conclusion of peace. All prisoners of war must\r\nenjoy every latitude in the exercise of their religion, including\r\nattendance at their own church service, provided only they comply with\r\nthe regulations for order issued by the military authorities. If a\r\nprisoner wants to make a will, it must be received by the authorities or\r\ndrawn up on the same conditions as for soldiers of the national army.\r\nAnd the same rules are valid regarding death certificates and the burial\r\nof prisoners of war, and due regard must be paid to their grade and\r\nrank. Letters, money orders, valuables, and postal parcels destined for\r\nor despatched by prisoners of war must enjoy free postage, and gifts and\r\nrelief in kind for prisoners of war must be admitted free from all\r\ncustom and other duties as well as payments for carriage by Government\r\nrailways (article 16).\r\n\r\n[Footnote 258: See below, § 144.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 259: See _Land Warfare_, § 69.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Who may claim to be Prisoners of War.]\r\n\r\n§ 127. Every individual who is deprived of his liberty not for a crime\r\nbut for military reasons has a claim to be treated as a prisoner of war.\r\nArticle 13 of the Hague Regulations expressly enacts that\r\nnon-combatant[260] members of armed forces, such as newspaper\r\ncorrespondents, reporters, sutlers, contractors, who are captured and\r\ndetained, may claim to be treated as prisoners of war, provided they can\r\nproduce a certificate from the military authorities of the army they\r\nwere accompanying. But although the Hague Regulations do not contain\r\nanything regarding the treatment of private enemy individuals and enemy\r\nofficials whom a belligerent thinks it necessary[261] to make prisoners\r\nof war, it is evident that they may claim all privileges of such\r\nprisoners. Such individuals are not convicts; they are taken into\r\ncaptivity for military reasons, and they are therefore prisoners of war.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 260: See above, § 79.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 261: See above, §§ 116 and 117.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Discipline.]\r\n\r\n§ 128. Articles 8 and 9 of the Hague Regulations lay down the discipline\r\nto be observed in the case of prisoners of war in the following\r\nway:--Every prisoner who, if questioned, does not declare his true name\r\nand rank is liable to a curtailment of the advantages accorded to\r\nprisoners of his class. All prisoners are subject to the laws,\r\nregulations, and orders in force in the army of the belligerent that\r\nkeeps them in captivity. Any act of insubordination on the part of\r\nprisoners may be punished in accordance with these laws,[262] but apart\r\nfrom these laws, all kinds of severe measures are admissible to prevent\r\na repetition of such acts. Escaped prisoners, who, after having rejoined\r\ntheir national army, are again taken prisoners, are not liable to any\r\npunishment for their flight. But if they are recaptured before they\r\nsucceed in rejoining their army, or before they have quitted the\r\nterritory occupied by the capturing forces, they are liable to\r\ndisciplinary punishment.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 262: Concerning the question whether after conclusion of peace\r\nsuch prisoners as are undergoing a term of imprisonment for offences\r\nagainst discipline may be detained, see below, § 275.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Release on Parole.]\r\n\r\n§ 129. Articles 10 to 12 of the Hague Regulations deal with release on\r\nparole in the following manner:--No belligerent is obliged to assent to\r\na prisoner's request to be released on parole, and no prisoner may be\r\nforced to accept such release. But if the laws of his country authorise\r\nhim to do so, and if he acquiesces, any prisoner may be released on\r\nparole. In such case he is in honour bound scrupulously to fulfil the\r\nengagement he has contracted, both as regards his own Government and the\r\nGovernment that released him. And his own Government is formally bound\r\nneither to request, nor to accept, from him any service incompatible\r\nwith the parole given. Any prisoner released on parole and recaptured\r\nbearing arms against the belligerent who released him, or against such\r\nbelligerent's allies, forfeits the privilege to be treated as a prisoner\r\nof war, and may be tried by court-martial. The Hague Regulations do not\r\nlay down the punishment for such breach of parole, but according to a\r\ncustomary rule of International Law the punishment may be capital.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bureau of Information.]\r\n\r\n§ 130. According to articles 14 and 16 of the Hague Regulations every\r\nbelligerent[263] must institute on the commencement of war a Bureau of\r\nInformation relative to his prisoners of war. This Bureau is intended to\r\nanswer all inquiries about prisoners. It must be furnished by all the\r\nservices concerned with all the necessary information to enable it to\r\nmake out and keep up to date a separate return for each prisoner, and it\r\nmust, therefore, be kept informed of internments and changes as well as\r\nof admissions into hospital, of deaths, releases on parole, exchanges,\r\nand escapes. It must state in its return for each prisoner the\r\nregimental number, surname and name, age, place of origin, rank, unit,\r\nwounds, date and place of capture, of internment, of the wounds\r\nreceived, date of death, and any observations of a special character.\r\nThis separate return must, after conclusion of peace, be sent to the\r\nGovernment of the other belligerent.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 263: And likewise such neutral States as receive and detain\r\nmembers of the armed forces of the belligerents; see article 14.]\r\n\r\nThe Bureau must likewise receive and collect all objects of personal\r\nuse, valuables, letters, and the like, found on battlefields[264] or\r\nleft by prisoners who have been released on parole, or exchanged, or who\r\nhave escaped, or died in hospital or ambulances, and must transmit these\r\narticles to those interested. The Bureau must enjoy the privilege of\r\nfree postage.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 264: See above, § 124.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Relief Societies.]\r\n\r\n§ 131. A new and valuable rule, taken from the Brussels Declaration, is\r\nthat of article 15 of the Hague Regulations making it a duty of every\r\nbelligerent to grant facilities to Relief Societies to serve as\r\nintermediaries for charity to prisoners of war. The condition of the\r\nadmission of such societies and their agents is that the former are\r\nregularly constituted in accordance with the law of their country.\r\nDelegates of such societies may be admitted to the places of internment\r\nfor the distribution of relief, as also to the halting-places of\r\nrepatriated prisoners, through a personal permit of the military\r\nauthorities, provided they give an engagement in writing that they will\r\ncomply with all regulations by the authorities for order and police.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: End of Captivity.]\r\n\r\n§ 132. Captivity can come to an end through different modes. Apart from\r\nrelease on parole, which has already been mentioned, captivity comes to\r\nan end--(1) through simple release without parole; (2) through\r\nsuccessful flight; (3) through liberation by the invading enemy to whose\r\narmy the respective prisoners belong; (4) through exchange for prisoners\r\ntaken by the enemy; (5) through prisoners[265] being brought into\r\nneutral territory by captors who take refuge there; and, lastly (6),\r\nthrough the war coming to an end. Release of prisoners for ransom is no\r\nlonger practised, except in the case of the crew of a captured\r\nmerchantman released on a ransom bill.[266] It ought, however, to be\r\nobserved that the practice of ransoming prisoners might be revived if\r\nconvenient, provided the ransom is to be paid not to the individual\r\ncaptor but to the belligerent whose forces made the capture.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 265: See below, § 337.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 266: See below, § 195.]\r\n\r\nAs regards the end of captivity through the war coming to an end, a\r\ndistinction must be made according to the different modes of ending war.\r\nIf the war ends by peace being concluded, captivity comes to an end at\r\nonce[267] with the conclusion of peace, and, as article 20 of the Hague\r\nRegulations expressly enacts, the repatriation of prisoners must be\r\neffected as speedily as possible. If, however, the war ends through\r\nconquest and annexation of the vanquished State, captivity comes to an\r\nend as soon as peace is established. It ought to end with annexation,\r\nand it will in most cases do so. But as guerilla war may well go on\r\nafter conquest and annexation, and thus prevent a condition of peace\r\nfrom being established, although real warfare is over, it is necessary\r\nnot to confound annexation with peace.[268] The point is of interest\r\nregarding such prisoners only as are subjects of neutral States. For\r\nother prisoners become through annexation subjects of the State that\r\nkeeps them in captivity, and such State is, therefore, as far as\r\nInternational Law is concerned, unrestricted in taking any measure it\r\nlikes with regard to them. It can repatriate them, and it will in most\r\ncases do so.

Under a former rule of International Law belligerents could\r\nappropriate all public and private[270] enemy property they found on\r\nenemy territory. This rule is now obsolete. Its place is taken by\r\nseveral rules, since distinctions are to be made between moveable and\r\nimmoveable property, public and private property, and, further, between\r\ndifferent kinds of private and public property. These rules must be\r\ndiscussed _seriatim_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 270: It is impossible for a treatise to go into historical\r\ndetails, and to show the gradual disappearance of the old rule. But it\r\nis of importance to state the fact, that even during the nineteenth\r\ncentury--see, for instance, G. F. Martens, II. § 280; Twiss, II. § 64;\r\nHall, § 139--it was asserted that in strict law all private enemy\r\nmoveable property was as much booty as public property, although the\r\ngrowth of a usage was recognised which under certain conditions exempted\r\nit from appropriation. In the face of articles 46 and 47 of the Hague\r\nRegulations these assertions have no longer any basis, and all the\r\ntext-books of the nineteenth century are now antiquated with regard to\r\nthis matter.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Immoveable Public Property.]\r\n\r\n§ 134. Appropriation of public immoveables is not lawful so long as the\r\nterritory on which they are has not become State property of the\r\noccupant through annexation. During mere military occupation of the\r\nenemy territory, a belligerent may not sell or otherwise alienate public\r\nenemy land and buildings, but only appropriate the produce of them.\r\nArticle 55 of the Hague Regulations expressly enacts that a belligerent\r\noccupying enemy territory shall only be regarded as administrator and\r\nusufructuary of the public buildings, real property, forests, and\r\nagricultural works belonging to the hostile State and situated on the\r\noccupied territory; that he must protect the stock and plant, and that\r\nhe must administer them according to the rules of usufruct. He may,\r\ntherefore, sell the crop from public land, cut timber in the public\r\nforests and sell it, may let public land and buildings for the time of\r\nhis occupation, and the like. He is, however, only usufructuary, and he\r\nis, therefore, prohibited from exercising his right in a wasteful or\r\nnegligent way that would decrease the value of the stock and plant.\r\nThus, for instance, he must not cut down a whole forest unless the\r\nnecessities of war compel him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Immoveable Property of Municipalities, and of Religious,\r\nCharitable, and the like Institutions.]\r\n\r\n§ 135. It must, however, be observed that the produce of such public\r\nimmoveables only as belong to the State itself may be appropriated, but\r\nnot the produce of those belonging to municipalities or of those which,\r\nalthough they belong to the hostile State, are permanently set aside for\r\nreligious purposes, for the maintenance of charitable and educational\r\ninstitutions, and for the benefit of art and science. Article 56 of the\r\nHague Regulations expressly enacts that such property is to be treated\r\nas private property.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Utilisation of Public Buildings.]\r\n\r\n§ 136. So far as the necessities of war demand, a belligerent may make\r\nuse of public enemy buildings for all kinds of purposes. Troops must be\r\nhoused, horses stabled, the sick and wounded nursed. Public buildings\r\nmay in the first instance, therefore, be made use of for such purposes,\r\nalthough they may thereby be considerably damaged. And it matters not\r\nwhether the buildings belong to the enemy State or to municipalities,\r\nwhether they are regularly destined for ordinary governmental and\r\nmunicipal purposes, or for religious, educational, scientific, and the\r\nlike purposes. Thus, churches may be converted into hospitals, schools\r\ninto barracks, buildings used for scientific research into stables. But\r\nit must be observed that such utilisation of public buildings as damages\r\nthem is justified only if it is necessary. A belligerent who turned a\r\npicture gallery into stables without being compelled thereto would\r\ncertainly commit a violation of the Law of Nations.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Moveable Public Property.]\r\n\r\n§ 137. Moveable public enemy property may certainly be appropriated by a\r\nbelligerent provided that it can directly or indirectly be useful for\r\nmilitary operations. Article 53 of the Hague Regulations unmistakably\r\nenacts that a belligerent occupying hostile territory may take\r\npossession of the cash, funds, realisable securities, depôts of arms,\r\nmeans of transport, stores, supplies, appliances on land or at sea or in\r\nthe air adapted for the transmission of news or for the transport of\r\npersons or goods, and of all other moveable property of the hostile\r\nState which may be used for military operations. Thus, a belligerent is\r\nentitled to seize not only the money and funds of the hostile State on\r\nthe one hand, and, on the other, munitions of war, depôts of arms,\r\nstores and supplies, but also the rolling-stock of public railways[271]\r\nand other means of transport and everything and anything he can directly\r\nor indirectly make use of for military operations. He may, for\r\ninstance, seize a quantity of cloth for the purpose of clothing his\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 271: See Nowacki, _Die Eisenbahnen im Kriege_ (1906), §§ 15\r\nand 19. Some writers--see, for instance, Bonfils, No. 1185, and Wehberg,\r\n_op. cit._ p. 22--maintain that such rolling stock may not be\r\nappropriated, but may only be made use of during war and must be\r\nrestored after the conclusion of peace. The assertion that article 53,\r\nsecond paragraph, is to be interpreted in that sense, is unfounded, for\r\nrestoration is there stipulated for such means of transport and the like\r\nas are _private_ property.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Moveable Property of Municipalities, and of Religious,\r\nCharitable, and the like Institutions.]\r\n\r\n§ 138. But exceptions similar to those regarding the usufruct of public\r\nimmoveables are valid in the case of the appropriation of public\r\nmoveables. Article 56 of the Hague Regulations enumerates the property\r\nof municipalities, of religious, charitable, educational institutions,\r\nand of those of science and art. Thus the moveable property of churches,\r\nhospitals, schools, universities, museums, picture galleries, even when\r\nbelonging to the hostile State, is exempt from appropriation by a\r\nbelligerent. As regards archives, they are no doubt institutions for\r\nscience, but a belligerent may nevertheless seize such State papers\r\ndeposited therein as are of importance to him in connection with the\r\nwar. The last instances of the former practice are presented by Napoleon\r\nI., who seized works of art during his numerous wars and had them taken\r\nto the galleries of Paris. But they had to be restored to their former\r\nowners in 1815.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Booty on the Battlefield.]\r\n\r\n§ 139. The case of moveable enemy property found by an invading\r\nbelligerent on enemy territory is different from the case of moveable\r\nenemy property on the battlefield. According to a former rule of the Law\r\nof Nations all enemy property, public or private, which a belligerent\r\ncould get hold of on the battlefield was booty and could be\r\nappropriated. Although some modern publicists[272] who wrote before the\r\nHague Peace Conference of 1899 teach the validity of this rule, it is\r\nobvious from articles 4 and 14 of the Hague Regulations that it is now\r\nobsolete as regards _private_[273] enemy property except military\r\npapers, arms, horses, and the like. But as regards _public_ enemy\r\nproperty this customary rule is still valid. Thus weapons, munition,\r\nand valuable pieces of equipment which are found upon the dead, the\r\nwounded, and the prisoners, whether they are public or private property,\r\nmay be seized, as may also the war-chest and State papers in possession\r\nof a captured commander, enemy horses, batteries, carts, and everything\r\nelse that is of value. To whom the booty ultimately belongs is not for\r\nInternational but for Municipal Law[274] to determine, since\r\nInternational Law simply states that public enemy property on the\r\nbattlefield can be appropriated by belligerents. And it must be\r\nspecially observed that the restriction of article 53 of the Hague\r\nRegulations according to which only such moveable property may be\r\nappropriated as can be used for the operations of war, does not find\r\napplication in the case of moveable property found on the battlefield,\r\nfor article 53 speaks of \"an army of occupation\" only. Such property may\r\nbe appropriated, whether it can be used for military operations or not;\r\nthe mere fact that it was seized on the battlefield entitles a\r\nbelligerent to appropriate it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 272: See, for instance, Halleck, II. p. 73, and Heffter, §\r\n135.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 273: See above, § 124, and below, § 144.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 274: According to British law all booty belongs to the Crown.\r\nSee Twiss, II. §§ 64 and 71.]\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nAPPROPRIATION AND UTILISATION OF PRIVATE ENEMY PROPERTY\r\n\r\n  Grotius, III. c. 5--Vattel, III. §§ 73, 160-164--Hall, §§ 139,\r\n  141-144--Lawrence, §§ 172-175--Maine, pp. 192-206--Manning, pp.\r\n  179-183--Twiss, II. §§ 62-71--Halleck, II. pp. 73-75--Moore, VII.\r\n  §§ 1121, 1151, 1152, 1155--Taylor, §§ 529, 532, 537--Wharton, III.\r\n  § 338--Wheaton, § 355--Bluntschli, §§ 652, 656-659--Heffter, §§\r\n  130-136--Lueder in Holtzendorff, IV. pp. 488-500--G.F.

Immoveable private enemy property may under no circumstances or\r\nconditions be appropriated by an invading belligerent. Should he\r\nconfiscate and sell private land or buildings, the buyer would acquire\r\nno right[275] whatever to the property. Article 46 of the Hague\r\nRegulations expressly enacts that \"private property may not be\r\nconfiscated.\" But confiscation differs from the temporary use of private\r\nland and buildings for all kinds of purposes demanded by the necessities\r\nof war. What has been said above in § 136 with regard to utilisation of\r\npublic buildings finds equal application[276] to private buildings. If\r\nnecessary they may be converted into hospitals, barracks, and stables\r\nwithout indemnification of the proprietors, and they may also be\r\nconverted into fortifications. A humane belligerent will not drive the\r\nwretched inhabitants into the street if he can help it. But under the\r\npressure of necessity he may be obliged to do this, and he is certainly\r\nnot prohibited from doing it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 275: See below, § 283.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 276: The Hague Regulations do not mention this; they simply\r\nenact in article 46 that private property must be \"respected,\" and may\r\nnot be confiscated.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Private War Material and Means of Transport.]\r\n\r\n§ 141. All kinds of private moveable property which can serve as war\r\nmaterial, such as arms, ammunition, cloth for uniforms, leather for\r\nboots, saddles, and also all appliances, whether on land or at sea or in\r\nthe air, which are adapted for the transmission of news or for the\r\ntransportation of persons and goods, such as railway rolling-stock,[277]\r\nships, telegraphs, telephones, carts, and horses, may be seized and made\r\nuse of for military purposes by an invading belligerent, but they must\r\nbe restored at the conclusion of peace, and indemnities must be paid for\r\nthem. This is expressly enacted by article 53 of the Hague Regulations.\r\nIt is evident that the seizure of such material must be duly\r\nacknowledged by receipt, although article 53 does not say so; for\r\notherwise how could indemnities be paid after the conclusion of peace?\r\nAs regards the question who is to pay the indemnities, Holland (_War_,\r\nNo. 113) correctly maintains that \"the Treaty of Peace must settle upon\r\nwhom the burden of making compensation is ultimately to fall.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 277: See Nowacki, _Die Eisenbahnen im Kriege_ (1906), § 15.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Works of Art and Science, Historical Monuments.]\r\n\r\n§ 142. On the other hand, works of art and science, and historical\r\nmonuments may not under any circumstances or conditions be appropriated\r\nor made use of for military operations. Article 56 of the Hague\r\nRegulations enacts categorically that \"all seizure\" of such works and\r\nmonuments is prohibited. Therefore, although the metal of which a statue\r\nis cast may be of the greatest value for cannons, it must not be\r\ntouched.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Other Private Personal Property.]\r\n\r\n§ 143. Private personal property which does not consist of war material\r\nor means of transport serviceable to military operations may not as a\r\nrule be seized.[278] Articles 46 and 47 of the Hague Regulations\r\nexpressly stipulate that \"private property may not be confiscated,\" and\r\n\"pillage is formally prohibited.\" But it must be emphasised that these\r\nrules have in a sense exceptions, demanded and justified by the\r\nnecessities of war. Men and horses must be fed, men must protect\r\nthemselves against the weather. If there is no time for ordinary\r\nrequisitions[279] to provide food, forage, clothing, and fuel, or if the\r\ninhabitants of a locality have fled so that ordinary requisitions cannot\r\nbe made, a belligerent must take these articles wherever he can get\r\nthem, and he is justified[280] in so doing. And it must further be\r\nemphasised that quartering[281] of soldiers who, together with their\r\nhorses, must be well fed by the inhabitants of the houses concerned, is\r\nlikewise lawful, although it may be ruinous to the private individuals\r\nupon whom they are quartered.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 278: See above, § 133, note.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 279: See below, § 147.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 280: The Hague Regulations do not mention this case.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 281: See below, § 147.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Booty on the Battlefield.]\r\n\r\n§ 144. Private enemy property on the battlefield is no longer in every\r\ncase an object of booty.[282] Arms, horses, and military papers may\r\nindeed be appropriated,[283] even if they are private property, as may\r\nalso private means of transport, such as carts and other vehicles which\r\nan enemy has made use of. But letters, cash, jewellery, and other\r\narticles of value found upon the dead, wounded, and prisoners must,\r\naccording to article 14 of the Hague Regulations and article 4 of the\r\nGeneva Convention, be handed over to the Bureau of Information regarding\r\nprisoners of war, which must transmit them to those interested. Through\r\narticle 14 of the Hague Regulations and article 4 of the Geneva\r\nConvention it becomes apparent that nowadays private enemy property,\r\nexcept military papers, arms, horses, and the like, is no longer booty,\r\nalthough, individual soldiers often take as much spoil as they can get.\r\nIt is impossible for the commanders to bring the offender to justice in\r\nevery case.[284]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 282: See above, § 139.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 283: See above, § 139, and article 4 of the Hague Regulations.\r\nThis article only mentions arms, horses, and military papers, but\r\nsaddles, stirrups, and the like go with horses, as ammunition goes with\r\narms, and these may for this reason likewise be appropriated; see _Land\r\nWarfare_, § 69, note (_e_).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 284: It is of interest to state the fact that, during the\r\nRusso-Japanese War, Japan carried out to the letter the stipulation of\r\narticle 14 of the Hague Regulations. Through the intermediary of the\r\nFrench Embassies in Tokio and St. Petersburg, all valuables found on the\r\nRussian dead and seized by the Japanese were handed over to the Russian\r\nGovernment.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Private Enemy Property brought into a Belligerent's\r\nTerritory.]\r\n\r\n§ 145. The case of private property found by a belligerent on enemy\r\nterritory differs from the case of such property brought during time of\r\nwar into the territory of a belligerent. That private enemy property on\r\na belligerent's territory at the time of the outbreak of war may not be\r\nconfiscated has already been stated above in § 102. Taking this fact\r\ninto consideration, as well as the other fact that private property\r\nfound on enemy territory is nowadays likewise as a rule exempt from\r\nconfiscation, there can be no doubt that private enemy property brought\r\ninto a belligerent's territory during time of war may not, as a rule, be\r\nconfiscated.[285] On the other hand, a belligerent may prohibit the\r\nwithdrawal of those articles of property which can be made use of by the\r\nenemy for military purposes, such as arms, ammunition, provisions, and\r\nthe like. And in analogy with article 53 of the Hague Regulations there\r\ncan be no doubt that a belligerent may seize such articles and make use\r\nof them for military purposes, provided that he restores them at the\r\nconclusion of peace and pays indemnities for them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 285: The case of enemy merchantmen seized in a belligerent's\r\nterritorial waters is, of course, an exception.]\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nREQUISITIONS AND CONTRIBUTIONS\r\n\r\n  Vattel, III. § 165--Hall, § 140-140*--Lawrence, § 180--Westlake,\r\n  II. pp. 96-102--Maine, p. 200--Twiss, II. § 64--Halleck, II. pp.\r\n  68-69--Taylor, §§ 538-539--Moore, VII. § 1146--Bluntschli, §§\r\n  653-655--Heffter, § 131--Lueder in Holtzendorff, IV. pp.\r\n  500-510--Ullmann, § 183--Bonfils, Nos. 1207-1226--Despagnet, Nos.\r\n  587-590--Pradier-Fodéré, VII.

Requisitions and contributions in war are the outcome of the\r\neternal principle that war must support war.[286] This means that every\r\nbelligerent may make his enemy pay as far as possible for the\r\ncontinuation of the war. But this principle, though it is as old as war\r\nand will only die with war itself, has not the same effect in modern\r\ntimes on the actions of belligerents as it formerly had. For thousands\r\nof years belligerents used to appropriate all private and public enemy\r\nproperty they could obtain, and, when modern International Law grew up,\r\nthis practice found legal sanction. But after the end of the seventeenth\r\ncentury this practice grew milder under the influence of the experience\r\nthat the provisioning of armies in enemy territory became more or less\r\nimpossible when the inhabitants were treated according to the old\r\nprinciple. Although belligerents retained in strict law the right to\r\nappropriate all private besides all public property, it became usual to\r\nabstain from enforcing such right, and in lieu thereof to impose\r\ncontributions of cash and requisitions in kind upon the inhabitants of\r\nthe invaded country.[287] And when this usage developed, no belligerent\r\never thought of paying in cash for requisitions, or giving a receipt for\r\nthem. But in the nineteenth century another practice became usual.\r\nCommanders then often gave a receipt for contributions and requisitions,\r\nin order to avoid abuse and to prevent further demands for fresh\r\ncontributions and requisitions by succeeding commanders without\r\nknowledge of the former impositions. And there are instances of cases\r\nduring the nineteenth century on record in which belligerents actually\r\npaid in cash for all requisitions they made. The usual practice at the\r\nend of the nineteenth century was that commanders always gave a receipt\r\nfor contributions, and that they either paid in cash for requisitions or\r\nacknowledged them by receipt, so that the respective inhabitants could\r\nbe indemnified by their own Government after conclusion of peace.\r\nHowever, no restriction whatever was imposed upon commanders with regard\r\nto the amount of contributions and requisitions, and with regard to the\r\nproportion between the resources of a country and the burden imposed.\r\nThe Hague Regulations have now settled the matter of contributions and\r\nrequisitions in a progressive way by enacting rules which put the whole\r\nmatter on a new basis. That war must support war remains a principle\r\nunder these regulations also. But they are widely influenced by the\r\ndemand that the enemy State as such, and not the private enemy\r\nindividuals, should be made to support the war, and that only so far as\r\nthe necessities of war demand it should contributions and requisitions\r\nbe imposed. Although certain public moveable property and the produce\r\nof public immoveables may be appropriated as heretofore, requisitions\r\nmust be paid for in cash or, if this is impossible, acknowledged by\r\nreceipt.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 286: Concerning the controversy as to the justification of\r\nRequisitions and Contributions, see Albrecht, _op. cit._ pp. 18-21.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 287: An excellent sketch of the historical development of the\r\npractice of requisitions and contributions is given by Keller,\r\n_Requisition und Kontribution_ (1898), pp. 5-26.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Requisitions in Kind, and Quartering.]\r\n\r\n§ 147. Requisition is the name for the demand for the supply of all\r\nkinds of articles necessary for an army, such as provisions for men and\r\nhorses, clothing, or means of transport. Requisition of certain services\r\nmay also be made, but they will be treated below in § 170 together with\r\noccupation, requisitions in kind only being within the scope of this\r\nsection. Now, what articles may be demanded by an army cannot once for\r\nall be laid down, as they depend upon the actual need of an army.\r\nAccording to article 52 of the Hague Regulations, requisitions may be\r\nmade from municipalities as well as from inhabitants, but they may be\r\nmade so far only as they are really necessary for the army. They may not\r\nbe made by individual soldiers or officers, but only by the commander in\r\nthe locality. All requisitions must be paid for in cash, and if this is\r\nimpossible, they must be acknowledged by receipt, and the payment of the\r\namount must be made as soon as possible. The principle that requisitions\r\nmust be paid for by the enemy is thereby absolutely recognised, but, of\r\ncourse, commanders-in-chief may levy contributions--see below, § 148--in\r\ncase they do not possess cash for the payment of requisitions. However\r\nthis may be, by the rule that requisitions must always be paid for, it\r\nagain becomes apparent and beyond all doubt that henceforth private\r\nenemy property is as a rule exempt from appropriation by an invading\r\narmy.\r\n\r\nA special kind of requisition is the quartering[288] of soldiers in the\r\nhouses of private inhabitants of enemy territory, by which each\r\ninhabitant is required to supply lodging and food for a certain number\r\nof soldiers, and sometimes also stabling and forage for horses.\r\nAlthough the Hague Regulations do not specially mention quartering,\r\narticle 52 is nevertheless to be applied to it, since quartering is\r\nnothing else than a special kind of requisition. If cash cannot be paid\r\nat once for quartering, every inhabitant concerned must get a receipt\r\nfor it, stating the number of soldiers quartered and the number of days\r\nthey were catered for, and the payment of the amount must be made as\r\nsoon as possible.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 288: See above, § 143.]\r\n\r\nBut it must be specially observed, that neither in the case of ordinary\r\nrequisitions nor in the case of quartering of troops is a commander\r\ncompelled to pay the prices asked by the inhabitants concerned. On the\r\ncontrary, he may fix the prices himself, although it is expected that\r\nthe prices paid shall be fair.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Contributions.]\r\n\r\n§ 148. Contribution is a payment in ready money demanded either from\r\nmunicipalities or from inhabitants, whether enemy subjects or foreign\r\nresidents. Whereas formerly no general rules concerning contributions\r\nexisted, articles 49 and 51 of the Hague Regulations now enact that\r\ncontributions may not be demanded extortionately, but exclusively[289]\r\nfor the needs of the army, in order, for instance, to pay for\r\nrequisitions or for the administration of the locality in question. They\r\nmay be imposed by a written order of a commander-in-chief only, in\r\ncontradistinction to requisitions which may be imposed by a mere\r\ncommander in a locality. They may not be imposed indiscriminately on the\r\ninhabitants, but must so far as possible be assessed upon such\r\ninhabitants in compliance with the rules in force of the respective\r\nenemy Government regarding the assessment of taxes. And, finally, for\r\nevery individual contribution a receipt must be given. It is apparent\r\nthat these rules of the Hague Regulations try to exclude all\r\narbitrariness and despotism on the part of an invading enemy with regard\r\nto contributions, and that they try to secure to the individual\r\ncontributors as well as to contributing municipalities the possibility\r\nof being indemnified afterwards by their own Government, thus shifting,\r\nso far as possible, the burden of supporting the war from private\r\nindividuals and municipalities to the State proper.[290]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 289: As regards contributions as a penalty, see article 50 of\r\nthe Hague Regulations. See also Keller, _op. cit._ pp. 60-62.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 290: It is strange to observe that _Kriegsbrauch_, pp. 61-63,\r\ndoes not mention the Hague Regulations at all.]\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nDESTRUCTION OF ENEMY PROPERTY\r\n\r\n  Grotius, III. c. 5, §§ 1-3; c. 12--Vattel, III. §§ 166-168--Hall,\r\n  § 186--Lawrence, § 206--Manning, p. 186--Twiss, II. §§\r\n  65-69--Halleck, II. pp. 63, 64, 71, 74--Taylor, §§\r\n  481-482--Wharton, III. § 349--Moore, VII. § 1113--Wheaton, §§\r\n  347-351--Bluntschli, §§ 649, 651, 662, 663--Heffter, § 125--Lueder\r\n  in Holtzendorff, IV. pp. 482-485--Klüber, § 262--G.

In former times invading armies frequently used to fire and\r\ndestroy all enemy property they could not make use of or carry away.\r\nAfterwards, when the practice of warfare grew milder, belligerents in\r\nstrict law retained the right to destroy enemy property according to\r\ndiscretion, although they did not, as a rule, any longer make use of\r\nsuch right. Nowadays, however, this right is obsolete. For in the\r\nnineteenth century it became a universally recognised rule of\r\nInternational Law that all useless and wanton destruction of enemy\r\nproperty, be it public or private, is absolutely prohibited. And this\r\nrule has now been expressly enacted by article 23 (_g_) of the Hague\r\nRegulations, where it is categorically enacted that \"to destroy ...\r\nenemy's property, unless such destruction ... be imperatively demanded\r\nby the necessities of war, is prohibited.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Destruction for the purpose of Offence and Defence.]\r\n\r\n§ 150. All destruction of and damage to enemy property for the purpose\r\nof offence and defence is _necessary_ destruction and damage, and\r\ntherefore lawful. It is not only permissible to destroy and damage all\r\nkinds of enemy property on the battlefield during battle, but also in\r\npreparation for battle or siege. To strengthen a defensive position a\r\nhouse may be destroyed or damaged. To cover the retreat of an army a\r\nvillage on the battlefield may be fired. The district around an enemy\r\nfortress held by a belligerent may be razed, and, therefore, all private\r\nand public buildings, all vegetation may be destroyed, and all bridges\r\nblown up within a certain area. If a farm, a village, or even a town is\r\nnot to be abandoned but prepared for defence, it may be necessary to\r\ndamage in many ways or entirely destroy private and public property.\r\nFurther, if and where a bombardment is lawful, all destruction of\r\nproperty involved in it becomes likewise lawful. When a belligerent\r\nforce obtains possession of an enemy factory for ammunition or\r\nprovisions for the enemy troops, if it is not certain that they can hold\r\nit against an attack, they may at least destroy the plant, if not the\r\nbuildings. Or if a force occupies an enemy fortress, they may raze the\r\nfortifications. Even a force intrenching themselves on a battlefield may\r\nbe obliged to resort to the destruction of many kinds of property.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Destruction in marching, reconnoitring, and conducting\r\nTransport.]\r\n\r\n§ 151. Destruction of enemy property in marching troops, conducting\r\nmilitary transport, and in reconnoitring, is likewise lawful if\r\nunavoidable. A reconnoitring party need not keep on the road if they can\r\nbetter serve their purpose by riding across the tilled fields. And\r\ntroops may be marched and transport may be conducted over crops when\r\nnecessary. A humane commander will not unnecessarily allow his troops\r\nand transport to march and ride over tilled fields and crops. But if the\r\npurpose of war necessitates it he is justified in so doing.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Destruction of Arms, Ammunition, and Provisions.]\r\n\r\n§ 152. Whatever enemy property a belligerent may appropriate he may\r\nlikewise destroy. To prevent the enemy from making use of them a\r\nretreating force may destroy arms, ammunition, provisions, and the like,\r\nwhich they have taken from the enemy or requisitioned and cannot carry\r\naway. But it must be specially observed that they may not destroy\r\nprovisions in the possession of private enemy inhabitants in order to\r\nprevent the enemy from making use of them in the future.[291]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 291: Nor is a commander allowed to requisition such provisions\r\nin order to have them destroyed, for article 52 of the Hague Regulations\r\nexpressly enacts that requisitions are only admissible for the\r\nnecessities of the army.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Destruction of Historical Monuments, Works of Art, and the\r\nlike.]\r\n\r\n§ 153. All destruction of and damage to historical monuments, works of\r\nart and science, buildings for charitable, educational, and\r\nreligious[292] purposes are specially prohibited by article 56 of the\r\nHague Regulations which enacts that the perpetrators of such acts must\r\nbe prosecuted (_poursuivie_), that is court-martialed. But it must be\r\nemphasised that these objects enjoy this protection only during military\r\noccupation of enemy territory. Should a battle be waged around an\r\nhistorical monument on open ground, should a church, a school, or a\r\nmuseum be defended and attacked during military operations, these\r\notherwise protected objects may be damaged or destroyed under the same\r\nconditions as other enemy property.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 292: It is of importance to state the fact that, according to\r\nGrotius (III. c. 5, §§ 2 and 3), destruction of graves, tombstones,\r\nchurches, and the like is not prohibited by the Law of Nations, although\r\nhe strongly (III. c. 12, §§ 5-7) advises that they should be spared\r\nunless their preservation is dangerous to the interests of the\r\ninvader.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General Devastation.]\r\n\r\n§ 154. The question must also be taken into consideration whether and\r\nunder what conditions general devastation of a locality, be it a town or\r\na larger part of enemy territory, is permitted. There cannot be the\r\nslightest doubt that such devastation is as a rule absolutely prohibited\r\nand only in exceptional cases permitted when, to use the words of\r\narticle 23 (_g_) of the Hague Regulations, it is \"imperatively demanded\r\nby the necessities of war.\" It is, however, impossible to define once\r\nfor all the circumstances which make a general devastation necessary,\r\nsince everything depends upon the merits of the special case. But the\r\nfact that a general devastation can be lawful must be admitted. And it\r\nis, for instance, lawful in case of a levy _en masse_ on already\r\noccupied territory, when self-preservation obliges a belligerent to\r\nresort to the most severe measures. It is also lawful when, after the\r\ndefeat of his main forces and occupation of his territory, an enemy\r\ndisperses his remaining forces into small bands which carry on guerilla\r\ntactics and receive food and information, so that there is no hope of\r\nending the war except by a general devastation which cuts off supplies\r\nof every kind from the guerilla bands. But it must be specially observed\r\nthat general devastation is only justified by imperative necessity and\r\nby the fact that there is no better and less severe way open to a\r\nbelligerent.[293]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 293: See Hall, § 186, who gives _in nuce_ a good survey of the\r\ndoctrine and practice of general devastation from Grotius down to the\r\nbeginning of the nineteenth century. See also Spaight, pp. 125-139.]\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, whenever a belligerent resorts to general devastation\r\nhe ought, if possible, to make some provision for the unfortunate\r\npeaceful population of the devastated tract of territory. It would be\r\nmore humane to take them away into captivity rather than let them perish\r\non the spot. The practice, resorted to during the South African war, to\r\nhouse the victims of devastation in concentration camps, must be\r\napproved. The purpose of war may even oblige a belligerent to confine a\r\npopulation forcibly[294] in concentration camps.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 294: See above, p. 153, note 1.

Assault is the rush of an armed force upon enemy forces in the\r\nbattlefield, or upon intrenchments, fortifications, habitations,\r\nvillages, or towns, such rushing force committing every violence against\r\nopposing persons and destroying all impediments. Siege is the\r\nsurrounding and investing of an enemy locality by an armed force,\r\ncutting off those inside from all communication for the purpose of\r\nstarving them into surrender or for the purpose of attacking the\r\ninvested locality and taking it by assault. Bombardment is the throwing\r\nby artillery of shot and shell upon persons and things. Siege can be\r\naccompanied by bombardment and assault, but this is not necessary, since\r\na siege can be carried out by mere investment and starvation caused\r\nthereby. Assault, siege, and bombardment are severally and jointly\r\nperfectly legitimate means of warfare.[295] Neither bombardment nor\r\nassault, if they take place on the battlefield, needs special\r\ndiscussion, as they are allowed under the same circumstances and\r\nconditions as force in general is allowed. The only question here is\r\nunder what circumstances assault and bombardment are allowed outside the\r\nbattlefield. The answer is indirectly given by article 25 of the Hague\r\nRegulations, where it is categorically enacted that \"the attack or\r\nbombardment, by any means[296] whatever, of towns, villages,\r\nhabitations, or buildings, which are not defended, is prohibited.\" Siege\r\nis not specially mentioned, because no belligerent would dream of\r\nbesieging an undefended locality, and because siege of an undefended\r\ntown would involve unjustifiable violence against enemy persons and\r\nwould, therefore, be unlawful. Be this as it may, the fact that defended\r\nlocalities only may now be bombarded, involves a decided advance in the\r\nview taken by International Law. For it was formerly asserted by many\r\nwriters[297] and military experts that, for certain reasons and\r\npurposes, undefended localities also might in exceptional cases be\r\nbombarded. But it must be specially observed that it matters not whether\r\nthe defended locality be fortified or not, since an unfortified place\r\ncan be defended.[298] And it must be mentioned that nothing prevents a\r\nbelligerent who has taken possession of an undefended fortified place\r\nfrom destroying the fortifications by bombardment as well as by other\r\nmeans.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 295: The assertion of some writers--see, for instance, Pillet,\r\npp. 104-107, and Mérignhac, p. 173--that bombardment is lawful only\r\nafter an unsuccessful attempt of the besiegers to starve the besieged\r\ninto surrender is not based upon a recognised rule of the Law of\r\nNations.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 296: The words _by any means whatever_ were inserted by the\r\nSecond Peace Conference in order to make it quite clear that the article\r\nis likewise to refer to bombardment from air-vessels.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 297: See, for instance, Lueder in Holtzendorff, IV. p. 451.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 298: See Holls, _The Peace Conference at the Hague_ (1900), p.\r\n152.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Assault, how carried out.]\r\n\r\n§ 156. No special rules of International Law exist with regard to the\r\nmode of carrying out an assault. Therefore, only the general rules\r\nrespecting offence and defence find application. It is in especial\r\nnot[299] necessary to give notice of an impending assault to the\r\nauthorities of the respective locality, or to request them to surrender\r\nbefore an assault is made. That an assault may or may not be preceded or\r\naccompanied by a bombardment, need hardly be mentioned, nor that by\r\narticle 28 of the Hague Regulations pillage of towns taken by assault is\r\nnow expressly prohibited.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 299: This becomes indirectly apparent from article 26 of the\r\nHague Regulations.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Siege, how carried out.]\r\n\r\n§ 157. With regard to the mode of carrying out siege without bombardment\r\nno special rules of International Law exist, and here too only the\r\ngeneral rules respecting offence and defence find application.\r\nTherefore, an armed force besieging a town may, for instance, cut off\r\nthe river which supplies drinking water to the besieged, but must not\r\npoison[300] such river. And it must be specially observed that no rule\r\nof law exists which obliges a besieging force to allow all\r\nnon-combatants, or only women, children, the aged, the sick and wounded,\r\nor subjects of neutral Powers, to leave the besieged locality\r\nunmolested. Although such permission[301] is sometimes granted, it is in\r\nmost cases refused, because the fact that non-combatants are besieged\r\ntogether with the combatants, and that they have to endure the same\r\nhardships, may, and very often does, exercise pressure upon the\r\nauthorities to surrender. Further, should the commander of a besieged\r\nplace expel the non-combatants in order to lessen the number of those\r\nwho consume his store of provisions, the besieging force need not allow\r\nthem to pass through its lines, but may drive them back.[302]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 300: See above, § 110.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 301: Thus in 1870, during the Franco-German War, the German\r\nbesiegers of Strassburg as well as of Belfort allowed the women, the\r\nchildren, and the sick to leave the besieged fortresses.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 302: See _Land Warfare_, § 129.]\r\n\r\nThat diplomatic envoys of neutral Powers may not be prevented from\r\nleaving a besieged town is a consequence of their exterritoriality.\r\nHowever, if they voluntarily remain, may they claim uncontrolled[303]\r\ncommunication with their home State by correspondence and couriers? When\r\nMr. Washburne, the American diplomatic envoy at Paris during the siege\r\nof that city in 1870 by the Germans, claimed the right of sending a\r\nmessenger with despatches to London in a sealed bag through the German\r\nlines, Bismarck declared that he was ready to allow foreign diplomatists\r\nin Paris to send a courier to their home States once a week, but only\r\nunder the condition that their despatches were open and did not contain\r\nany remarks concerning the war. Although the United States and other\r\nPowers protested, Bismarck did not alter his decision. The whole\r\nquestion must be treated as open.[304]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 303: The matter is discussed by Rolin-Jaequemyns in _R.I._\r\nIII. (1871), pp. 371-377.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 304: See above, vol. I. § 399, and Wharton, I. § 97.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bombardment, how carried out.]\r\n\r\n§ 158. Regarding bombardment, article 26 of the Hague Regulations enacts\r\nthat the commander of the attacking forces shall do all he can to notify\r\nhis intention to resort to bombardment. But it must be emphasised that a\r\nstrict duty of notification for all cases of bombardment is not thereby\r\nimposed, since it is only enacted that a commander _shall do all he can_\r\nto send notification. He cannot do it when the circumstances of the case\r\nprevent him, or when the necessities of war demand an immediate\r\nbombardment. Be that as it may, the purpose of notification is to enable\r\nprivate individuals within the locality to be bombarded to seek shelter\r\nfor their persons and for their valuable personal property.\r\n\r\nArticle 27 of the Hague Regulations enacts the hitherto customary rule\r\nthat all necessary steps must be taken to spare as far as possible all\r\nbuildings devoted to religion, art, science, and charity; further,\r\nhistoric monuments, hospitals, and all other places where the sick and\r\nwounded are collected, provided these buildings, places, and monuments\r\nare not used at the same time for military purposes. To enable the\r\nattacking forces to spare these buildings and places, the latter must be\r\nindicated by some particular signs, which must be previously notified to\r\nthe attacking forces and must be visible from the far distance from\r\nwhich the besieging artillery carries out the bombardment.[305]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 305: No siege takes place without the besieged accusing the\r\nbesiegers of neglecting the rule that buildings devoted to religion,\r\nart, charity, the tending of the sick, and the like, must be spared\r\nduring bombardments. The fact is that in case of a bombardment the\r\ndestruction of such buildings cannot always be avoided, although the\r\nartillery of the besiegers do not intentionally aim at them. That the\r\nforces of civilised States intentionally destroy such buildings, I\r\ncannot believe.]\r\n\r\nIt must be specially observed that no legal duty exists for the\r\nattacking forces to restrict bombardment to fortifications only. On the\r\ncontrary, destruction of private and public buildings through\r\nbombardment has always been and is still considered lawful, as it is one\r\nof the means to impress upon the authorities the advisability of\r\nsurrender. Some writers[306] assert either that bombardment of the town,\r\nin contradistinction to the fortifications, is never lawful, or that it\r\nis only lawful when bombardment of the fortifications has not resulted\r\nin inducing surrender. But this opinion does not represent the actual\r\npractice of belligerents, and the Hague Regulations do not adopt it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 306: See, for instance, Pillet, pp. 104-107; Bluntschli §\r\n554A; Mérignhac, p. 180.

To obtain the necessary\r\ninformation, it has always been considered lawful, on the one hand, to\r\nemploy spies, and, on the other, to make use of the treason of enemy\r\nsoldiers or private enemy subjects, whether they were bribed[307] or\r\noffered the information voluntarily and gratuitously. Article 24 of the\r\nHague Regulations enacts the old customary rule that the employment of\r\nmethods necessary to obtain information about the enemy and the country\r\nis considered allowable. The fact, however, that these methods are\r\nlawful on the part of the belligerent who employs them does not prevent\r\nthe punishment of such individuals as are engaged in procuring\r\ninformation. Although a belligerent acts lawfully in employing spies and\r\ntraitors, the other belligerent, who punishes spies and traitors,\r\nlikewise acts lawfully. Indeed, espionage and treason bear a twofold\r\ncharacter. For persons committing acts of espionage or treason are--as\r\nwill be shown below in § 255--considered war criminals and may be\r\npunished, but the employment of spies and traitors is considered lawful\r\non the part of the belligerents.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 307: Some writers maintain, however, that it is not lawful to\r\nbribe enemy soldiers into espionage; see below, § 162.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Espionage in contradistinction to Scouting and\r\nDespatch-bearing.]\r\n\r\n§ 160. Espionage must not be confounded, firstly, with scouting, or\r\nsecondly, with despatch-bearing. According to article 29 of the Hague\r\nRegulations, espionage is the act of a soldier or other individual who\r\nclandestinely, or under false pretences, seeks to obtain information\r\nconcerning one belligerent in the zone of belligerent operations with\r\nthe intention of communicating it to the other belligerent.[308]\r\nTherefore, soldiers not in disguise, who penetrate into the zone of\r\noperations of the enemy, are not spies. They are scouts who enjoy all\r\nprivileges of the members of armed forces, and they must, if captured,\r\nbe treated as prisoners of war. Likewise, soldiers or civilians charged\r\nwith the delivery of despatches for their own army or for that of the\r\nenemy and carrying out their mission openly are not spies. And it\r\nmatters not whether despatch-bearers make use of balloons or of other\r\nmeans of communication. Thus, a soldier or civilian trying to carry\r\ndespatches from a force besieged in a fortress to other forces of the\r\nsame belligerent, whether making use of a balloon or riding or walking\r\nat night, may not be treated as a spy. On the other hand, spying can\r\nwell be carried out by despatch-bearers or by persons in a balloon,\r\nwhether they make use of the balloon of a despatch-bearer or rise in a\r\nballoon for the special purpose of spying.[309] The mere fact that a\r\nballoon is visible does not protect the persons using it from being\r\ntreated as spies; since spying can be carried out under false pretences\r\nquite as well as clandestinely. But special care must be taken really to\r\nprove the fact of espionage in such cases, for an individual carrying\r\ndespatches is _prima facie_ not a spy and must not be treated as a spy\r\nuntil proved to be such.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 308: Assisting or favouring espionage or knowingly concealing\r\na spy are, according to a customary rule of International Law,\r\npunishable as though they were themselves acts of espionage; see _Land\r\nWarfare_, § 172.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 309: See below, § 356 (4), concerning wireless telegraphy.]\r\n\r\nA remarkable case of espionage is that of Major André,[310] which\r\noccurred in 1780 during the American War of Independence. The American\r\nGeneral Arnold, who was commandant of West Point, on the North River,\r\nintended to desert the Americans and join the British forces. He opened\r\nnegotiations with Sir Henry Clinton for the purpose of surrendering West\r\nPoint, and Major André was commissioned by Sir Henry Clinton to make the\r\nfinal arrangements with Arnold. On the night of September 21, Arnold and\r\nAndré met outside the American and British lines, but André, after\r\nhaving changed his uniform for plain clothes, undertook to pass the\r\nAmerican lines on his return, furnished with a passport under the name\r\nof John Anderson by General Arnold. He was caught, convicted as a spy,\r\nand hanged. As he was not seeking information,[311] and therefore was\r\nnot a spy according to article 29 of the Hague Regulations, a conviction\r\nfor espionage would not, if such a case occurred to-day, be justified.\r\nBut it would be possible to convict for war treason, for André was no\r\ndoubt negotiating treason. Be that as it may, George III. considered\r\nAndré a martyr, and honoured his memory by granting a pension to his\r\nmother and a baronetcy to his brother.[312]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 310: See Halleck in _A.J._ V. (1911), p. 594.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 311: Halleck, _loc. cit._, p. 598, asserts the contrary.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 312: See Phillimore, III. § 106; Halleck, I. p. 575; Rivier,\r\nII. p. 284.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Punishment of Espionage.]\r\n\r\n§ 161. The usual punishment for spying is hanging or shooting, but less\r\nsevere punishments are, of course, admissible and sometimes inflicted.\r\nHowever this may be, according to article 30 of the Hague Regulations a\r\nspy may not be punished without a trial before a court-martial. And\r\naccording to article 31 of the Hague Regulations a spy who is not\r\ncaptured in the act but rejoins the army to which he belongs, and is\r\nsubsequently captured by the enemy, may not be punished for his previous\r\nespionage and must be treated as a prisoner of war. But it must be\r\nspecially observed that article 31 concerns only such spies as belong to\r\nthe armed forces of the enemy; civilians who act as spies and are\r\ncaptured later may be punished. Be that as it may, no regard is paid to\r\nthe status, rank, position, or motive of a spy. He may be a soldier or a\r\ncivilian, an officer or a private. He may be following instructions of\r\nsuperiors or acting on his own initiative from patriotic motives. A case\r\nof espionage, remarkable on account of the position of the spy, is that\r\nof the American Captain Nathan Hale, which occurred in 1776. After the\r\nAmerican forces had withdrawn from Long Island, Captain Hale recrossed\r\nunder disguise and obtained valuable information about the English\r\nforces that had occupied the island. But he was caught before he could\r\nrejoin his army, and he was executed as a spy.[313]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 313: The case of Major Jakoga and Captain Oki, which, though\r\nreported as a case of espionage, is really a case of treason, will be\r\ndiscussed below in § 255.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Treason.]\r\n\r\n§ 162. Treason can be committed by a soldier or an ordinary subject of a\r\nbelligerent, but it can also be committed by an inhabitant of an\r\noccupied enemy territory or even by the subject of a neutral State\r\ntemporarily staying there, and it can take place after an arrangement\r\nwith the favoured belligerent or without such an arrangement. In any\r\ncase a belligerent making use of treason acts lawfully, although the\r\nHague Regulations do not mention the matter at all. But many acts of\r\ndifferent sorts can be treasonable; the possible cases of treason and\r\nthe punishment of treason will be discussed below in § 255.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is generally recognised that a belligerent acts lawfully who\r\nmakes use of the offer of a traitor, the question is controversial[314]\r\nwhether a belligerent acts lawfully who bribes a commander of an enemy\r\nfortress into surrender, incites enemy soldiers to desertion, bribes\r\nenemy officers for the purpose of getting important information, incites\r\nenemy subjects to rise against the legitimate Government, and the like.\r\nIf the rules of the Law of Nations are formulated, not from doctrines of\r\nbook-writers, but from what is done by the belligerents in\r\npractice,[315] it must be asserted that such acts, detestable and\r\nimmoral as they are, are not considered illegal according to the Law of\r\nNations.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 314: See Vattel, III. § 180; Heffter, § 125; Taylor, § 490;\r\nMartens, II. § 110 (8); Longuet, § 52; Mérignhac, p. 188, and others.\r\nSee also below, § 164.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 315: See _Land Warfare_, § 158.]\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nRUSES\r\n\r\n  Grotius, III. c. 1, §§ 6-18--Bynkershoek, _Quaest. jur. publ._ I.\r\n  c. 1--Vattel, III. §§ 177-178--Hall, § 187--Lawrence, §\r\n  207--Westlake, II. p. 73--Phillimore, III. § 94--Halleck, I. pp.\r\n  566-571--Taylor, § 488--Moore, VII. § 1115--Bluntschli, §§\r\n  565-566--Heffter, § 125--Lueder in Holtzendorff, IV. pp.\r\n  457-461--Ullmann, § 176--Bonfils, Nos. 1073-1075--Despagnet, Nos.\r\n  526-527--Pradier-Fodéré, VI.

Ruses of war or stratagems are deceit employed during military\r\noperations for the purpose of misleading the enemy. Such deceit is of\r\ngreat importance in war, and, just as belligerents are allowed to\r\nemploy all methods of obtaining information, so they are, on the other\r\nhand, and article 24 of the Hague Regulations confirms this, allowed to\r\nemploy all sorts of ruses for the purpose of deceiving the enemy. Very\r\nimportant objects can be attained through ruses of war, as, for\r\ninstance, the surrender of a force or of a fortress, the evacuation of\r\nterritory held by the enemy, the withdrawal from a siege, the\r\nabandonment of an intended attack, and the like. But ruses of war are\r\nalso employed, and are very often the decisive factor, during battles.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Different kinds of Stratagems.]\r\n\r\n§ 164. Of ruses there are so many kinds that it is impossible to\r\nenumerate[316] and classify them. But in order to illustrate acts\r\ncarried out as ruses some instances may be given. It is hardly necessary\r\nto mention the laying of ambushes and traps, the masking of military\r\noperations such as marches or the erection of batteries and the like,\r\nthe feigning of attacks or flights or withdrawals, the carrying out of a\r\nsurprise, and other stratagems employed every day in war. But it is\r\nimportant to know that, when useful, feigned signals and bugle-calls may\r\nbe ordered, the watchword of the enemy may be used, deceitful\r\nintelligence may be disseminated,[317] the signals and the bugle-calls\r\nof the enemy may be mimicked[318] to mislead his forces. And even such\r\ndetestable acts[319] as bribery of enemy commanders and officials in\r\nhigh position, and secret seduction of enemy soldiers to desertion, and\r\nof enemy subjects to insurrection, are frequently committed, although\r\nmany writers protest. As regards the use of the national flag, the\r\nmilitary ensigns, and the uniforms of the enemy, theory and practice\r\nare unanimous in rejecting it during actual attack and defence, since\r\nthe principle is considered inviolable that during actual fighting\r\nbelligerent forces ought to be certain who is friend and who is foe. But\r\nmany[320] publicists maintain that until the actual fighting begins\r\nbelligerent forces may by way of stratagem make use of the national\r\nflag, military ensigns, and uniforms of the enemy. Article 23 (_f_) of\r\nthe Hague Regulations does not prohibit any and every use of these\r\nsymbols, but only their _improper_ use, thus leaving the question\r\nopen,[321] what uses are proper and what are not. Those who have\r\nhitherto taught the admissibility of the use of these symbols outside\r\nactual fighting can correctly maintain that the quoted article 23 (_f_)\r\ndoes not prohibit it.[322]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 316: See _Land Warfare_, § 144, where a great number of\r\nlegitimate ruses are enumerated.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 317: See the examples quoted by Pradier-Fodéré, VI. No. 2761.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 318: See Pradier-Fodéré, VI. No. 2760.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 319: The point has been discussed above in § 162.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 320: See, for instance, Hall, § 187; Bluntschli, § 565;\r\nTaylor, § 488; Calvo, IV. No. 2106; Pillet, p. 95; Longuet, § 54. But,\r\non the other hand, the number of publicists who consider it illegal to\r\nmake use of the enemy flag, ensigns, and uniforms, even before an actual\r\nattack, is daily becoming larger; see, for instance, Lueder in\r\nHoltzendorff, IV. p. 458; Mérignhac, p. 166; Pradier-Fodéré, VI. No.\r\n2760; Bonfils, No. 1074; _Kriegsbrauch_, p. 24. As regards the use of\r\nthe enemy flag on the part of men-of-war, see below, in § 211.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 321: Some writers maintain that article 23 (_f_) of the Hague\r\nRegulations has settled the controversy, but they forget that this\r\narticle speaks only of the _improper_ use of the enemy ensigns and\r\nuniform. See _Land Warfare_, § 152.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 322: The use of the enemy uniform for the purpose of deceit is\r\ndifferent from the case when members of armed forces who are deficient\r\nin clothes wear the uniforms of prisoners or of the enemy dead. If this\r\nis done--and it always will be done if necessary--such distinct\r\nalterations in the uniform ought to be made as will make it apparent to\r\nwhich side the soldiers concerned belong (see _Land Warfare_, § 154).\r\nDifferent again is the case where soldiers are, through lack of\r\nclothing, obliged to wear the apparel of civilians, such as greatcoats,\r\nhats, and the like. Care must then be taken that the soldiers concerned\r\ndo nevertheless wear a fixed distinctive emblem which marks them as\r\nsoldiers, since otherwise they lose the privileges of members of the\r\narmed forces of the belligerents (see article 1, No. 2, of the Hague\r\nRegulations). During the Russo-Japanese War both belligerents repeatedly\r\naccused each other of using Chinese clothing for members of their armed\r\nforces; the soldiers concerned apparently were obliged through lack of\r\nproper clothing temporarily to make use of Chinese garments. See,\r\nhowever, Takahashi, pp. 174-178.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Stratagems in contradistinction to Perfidy.]\r\n\r\n§ 165. Stratagems must be carefully distinguished from perfidy, since\r\nthe former are allowed, whereas the latter is prohibited. Halleck (I. p.\r\n566) correctly formulates the distinction by laying down the principle\r\nthat, whenever a belligerent has expressly or tacitly engaged and is\r\ntherefore bound by a moral obligation to speak the truth to an enemy, it\r\nis perfidy to betray the latter's confidence, because it contains a\r\nbreach of good faith.[323] Thus a flag of truce or the cross of the\r\nGeneva Convention must never be made use of for a stratagem,\r\ncapitulations must be carried out to the letter, the feigning of\r\nsurrender for the purpose of luring the enemy into a trap is a\r\ntreacherous act, as is the assassination of enemy commanders or soldiers\r\nor heads of States. On the other hand, stratagem may be met by\r\nstratagem, and a belligerent cannot complain of the enemy who so\r\ndeceives him. If, for instance, a spy of the enemy is bribed to give\r\ndeceitful intelligence to his employer, or if an officer, who is\r\napproached by the enemy and offered a bribe, accepts it feigningly but\r\ndeceives the briber and leads him to disaster, no perfidy is committed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 323: See _Land Warfare_, §§ 139-142, 146-150.]\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nOCCUPATION OF ENEMY TERRITORY\r\n\r\n  Grotius, III. c. 6, § 4--Vattel, III. §§ 197-200--Hall, §§\r\n  153-161--Westlake, II. pp. 83-106--Lawrence, §§ 176-179--Maine,\r\n  pp. 176-183--Halleck, II. pp. 432-466--Taylor, §§\r\n  568-579--Wharton, III. §§ 354-355--Moore, VII. §§\r\n  1143-1155--Bluntschli, §§ 539-551--Heffter, §§ 131-132--Lueder in\r\n  Holtzendorff, IV. pp. 510-524--Klüber, §§ 255-256--G.

If a belligerent succeeds in occupying a part or even the whole\r\nof the enemy territory, he has realised a very important aim of warfare.\r\nHe can now not only make use of the resources of the enemy country for\r\nmilitary purposes, but can also keep it for the time being as a pledge\r\nof his military success, and thereby impress upon the enemy the\r\nnecessity of submitting to terms of peace. And in regard to occupation,\r\nInternational Law respecting warfare has progressed more than in any\r\nother department. In former times enemy territory that was occupied by a\r\nbelligerent was in every point considered his State property, with which\r\nand with the inhabitants therein he could do what he liked. He could\r\ndevastate the country with fire and sword, appropriate all public and\r\nprivate property therein, kill the inhabitants, or take them away into\r\ncaptivity, or make them take an oath of allegiance. He could, even\r\nbefore the war was decided and his occupation was definitive, dispose of\r\nthe territory by ceding it to a third State, and an instance of this\r\nhappened during the Northern War (1700-1718), when in 1715 Denmark sold\r\nthe occupied Swedish territories of Bremen and Verden to Hanover. That\r\nan occupant could force the inhabitants of the occupied territory to\r\nserve in his own army and to fight against their legitimate sovereign,\r\nwas indubitable. Thus, during the Seven Years' War, Frederick II. of\r\nPrussia repeatedly made forcible levies of thousands of recruits in\r\nSaxony, which he had occupied. But during the second half of the\r\neighteenth century things gradually began to undergo a change. That the\r\ndistinction between mere temporary military occupation of territory, on\r\nthe one hand, and, on the other, real acquisition of territory through\r\nconquest and subjugation, became more and more apparent, is shown by the\r\nfact that Vattel (III. § 197) drew attention to it. However, it was not\r\ntill long after the Napoleonic wars in the nineteenth century that the\r\nconsequences of this distinction were carried to their full extent by\r\nthe theory and practice of International Law. So late as 1808, after the\r\nRussian troops had militarily occupied Finland, which was at that time a\r\npart of Sweden, Alexander I. of Russia made the inhabitants take an oath\r\nof allegiance,[324] although it was only by article 4 of the Peace\r\nTreaty of Frederikshamm[325] of September 17, 1809, that Sweden ceded\r\nFinland to Russia. The first writer who drew all the consequences of the\r\ndistinction between mere military occupation and real acquisition of\r\nterritory was Heffter in his treatise _Das Europaeische Völkerrecht der\r\nGegenwart_ (§ 131), which made its appearance in 1844. And it is\r\ncertain that it took the whole of the nineteenth century to develop such\r\nrules regarding occupation as are now universally recognised and in many\r\nrespects enacted by articles 42-56 of the Hague Regulations.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 324: See Martens, _N.R._ I. p. 9.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 325: See Martens, _N.R._ I. p. 19.]\r\n\r\nIn so far as these rules touch upon the special treatment of persons and\r\nproperty of the inhabitants of, and public property situated within,\r\noccupied territory, they have already been taken into consideration\r\nabove in §§ 107-154. What concerns us here are the rights and duties of\r\nthe occupying belligerent in relation to his political administration of\r\nthe territory and to his political authority over its inhabitants.[326]\r\nThe principle underlying these modern rules is that, although the\r\noccupant does in no wise acquire sovereignty over such territory through\r\nthe mere fact of having occupied it, he actually exercises for the time\r\nbeing a military authority over it. As he thereby prevents the\r\nlegitimate Sovereign from exercising his authority and claims obedience\r\nfor himself from the inhabitants, he has to administer the country not\r\nonly in the interest of his own military advantage, but also, so far as\r\npossible at any rate, for the public benefit of the inhabitants. Thus\r\nthe present International Law not only gives certain rights to an\r\noccupant, but also imposes certain duties upon him.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 326: The Hague Regulations (Section III. articles 42-56), and\r\nall the French writers, but also many others, treat under the heading\r\n\"occupation\" not only of the rights and duties of an occupant concerning\r\nthe political administration of the country and the political authority\r\nover the inhabitants, but also of other matters, such as appropriation\r\nof public and private property, requisitions and contributions, and\r\ndestruction of public and private property, violence against private\r\nenemy subjects and enemy officials. These matters have, however, nothing\r\nto do with occupation, but are better discussed in connection with the\r\nmeans of land warfare; see above, §§ 107-154.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Occupation, when effected.]\r\n\r\n§ 167. Since an occupant, although his power is merely military, has\r\ncertain rights and duties, the first question to deal with is, when and\r\nunder what circumstances a territory must be considered occupied.\r\n\r\nNow it is certain that mere invasion is not occupation. Invasion is the\r\nmarching or riding of troops--or the flying of a military air\r\nvessel--into enemy country. Occupation is invasion _plus_ taking\r\npossession of enemy country for the purpose of holding it, at any rate\r\ntemporarily. The difference between mere invasion and occupation becomes\r\napparent by the fact that an occupant sets up some kind of\r\nadministration, whereas the mere invader does not. A small belligerent\r\nforce can raid enemy territory without establishing any administration,\r\nbut quickly rush on to some place in the interior for the purpose of\r\nreconnoitring, of destroying a bridge or depôt of munitions and\r\nprovisions, and the like, and quickly withdraw after having realised its\r\npurpose.[327] Although it may correctly be asserted that, so long and in\r\nso far as such raiding force is in possession of a locality and sets up\r\na temporary administration therein, it occupies this locality, yet it\r\ncertainly does not occupy the whole territory, and even the occupation\r\nof such locality ceases the moment the force withdraws.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 327: See _Land Warfare_, § 343.]\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, as a rule occupation will be coincident with\r\ninvasion. The troops march into a district, and the moment they get into\r\na village or town--unless they are actually fighting their way--they\r\ntake possession of the Municipal Offices, the Post Office, the Police\r\nStations, and the like, and assert their authority there. From the\r\nmilitary point of view such villages and towns are now \"occupied.\"\r\nArticle 42 of the Hague Regulations enacts that territory is considered\r\noccupied when it is actually placed under the authority of the hostile\r\narmy, and that such occupation applies only to the territory where that\r\nauthority is established and in a position to assert itself. This\r\ndefinition of occupation is not at all precise, but it is as precise as\r\na legal definition of such kind of fact as occupation can be. If, as\r\nsome publicists[328] maintain, only such territory were actually\r\noccupied, in which every part is held by a sufficient number of soldiers\r\nto enforce immediately and on the very spot the authority of an\r\noccupant, an effective occupation of a large territory would be\r\nimpossible, since then not only in every town, village, and railway\r\nstation, but also in every isolated habitation and hut the presence of a\r\nsufficient number of soldiers would be necessary. Reasonably no other\r\nconditions ought to be laid down as necessary to constitute effective\r\noccupation in war than those under which in time of peace a Sovereign is\r\nable to assert his authority over a territory. What these conditions are\r\nis a question of fact which is to be answered according to the merits of\r\nthe special case. When the legitimate Sovereign is prevented from\r\nexercising his powers and the occupant, being able to assert his\r\nauthority, actually establishes an administration over a territory, it\r\nmatters not with what means and in what ways his authority is exercised.\r\nFor instance, when in the centre of a territory a large force is\r\nestablished from which flying columns are constantly sent round the\r\nterritory, such territory is indeed effectively occupied, provided there\r\nare no enemy forces present, and, further, provided these columns can\r\nreally keep the territory concerned under control.[329] Again, when an\r\narmy is marching on through enemy territory, taking possession of the\r\nlines of communication and the open towns, surrounding the fortresses\r\nwith besieging forces, and disarming the inhabitants in open places of\r\nhabitation, the whole territory left behind the army is effectively\r\noccupied, provided some kind of administration is established, and\r\nfurther provided that, as soon as it becomes necessary to assert the\r\nauthority of the occupant, a sufficient force can within reasonable time\r\nbe sent to the locality affected. The conditions vary with those of the\r\ncountry concerned. When a vast country is thinly populated, a smaller\r\nforce is necessary to occupy it, and a smaller number of centres need be\r\ngarrisoned than in the case of a thickly populated country. Thus, the\r\noccupation of the former Orange Free State and the former South African\r\nRepublic became effective in 1901 some time after their annexation by\r\nGreat Britain and the degeneration of ordinary war into guerilla war,\r\nalthough only about 250,000 British soldiers had to keep up the\r\noccupation of a territory of about 500,000 square miles. The fact that\r\nall the towns and all the lines of communication were in the hands and\r\nunder the administration of the British army, that the inhabitants of\r\nsmaller places were taken away into concentration camps, that the enemy\r\nforces were either in captivity or dispersed into comparatively small\r\nguerilla bands, and finally, that wherever such bands tried to make an\r\nattack, a sufficient British force could within reasonable time make its\r\nappearance, was quite sufficient to assert British authority[330] over\r\nthat vast territory, although it was more than a year before peace was\r\nfinally established.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 328: See, for instance, Hall, § 161. This was also the\r\nstandpoint of the delegates of the smaller States at the Brussels\r\nConference of 1874 when the Declaration of Brussels was drafted.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 329: This is not identical with so-called _constructive_\r\noccupation, but is really _effective_ occupation. An occupation is\r\nconstructive only if an invader declares districts as occupied over\r\nwhich he actually does not exercise control--for instance, when he\r\nactually occupies only the capital of a large province, and proclaims\r\nthat he has thereby occupied the whole of the province, although he does\r\nnot take any steps to exercise control over it.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 330: The annexation of the Orange Free State dates from May\r\n24, 1900, and that of the South African Republic from September 1, 1900.\r\nIt may well be doubted whether at these dates the occupation of the\r\nterritories concerned was already so complete as to be called effective.\r\nThe British Government ought not, therefore, to have proclaimed the\r\nannexation at such early dates. But there ought to be no doubt that the\r\noccupation became effective some time afterwards, in 1901. See, however,\r\nSir Thomas Barclay in _The Law Quarterly Review_, XXI. (1905), p. 307,\r\nwho asserts the contrary; see also, below, § 264, p. 326, note 2, and §\r\n265, p. 327, note 1. _The Times' History of the War in South Africa_\r\n(vol. V. p. 251) estimates the number of Boer fighters in May 1901 to be\r\nabout 13,000. These armed men were dispersed into a very large number of\r\nguerilla bands, and they were in a great many cases men who seemingly\r\nhad submitted to the British authorities, but afterwards had taken up\r\narms.]\r\n\r\nIt must be emphasised that the rules regarding effective occupation must\r\nbe formulated on the basis of actual practice quite as much as rules\r\nregarding other matters of International Law. Those rules are not\r\nauthoritative which are laid down by theorists, but only those which are\r\nabstracted from the actual practice of warfare and are unopposed by the\r\nPowers.[331]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 331: The question is so much controverted that it is\r\nimpossible to enumerate the different opinions. Readers who want to\r\nstudy the question must be referred to the literature quoted above at\r\nthe commencement of § 166.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Occupation, when ended.]\r\n\r\n§ 168. Occupation comes to an end when an occupant withdraws from a\r\nterritory or is driven out of it. Thus, occupation remains only over a\r\nlimited area of a territory if the forces in occupation are drawn into a\r\nfortress on that territory and are there besieged by the re-advancing\r\nenemy, or if the occupant concentrates his forces in a certain place of\r\nthe territory, withdrawing before the re-advancing enemy. But occupation\r\ndoes not cease because the occupant, after having disarmed the\r\ninhabitants and having made arrangements for the administration of the\r\ncountry, is marching on to overtake the retreating enemy, leaving only\r\ncomparatively few soldiers behind.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rights and Duties in General of the Occupant.]\r\n\r\n§ 169. As the occupant actually exercises authority, and as the\r\nlegitimate Government is prevented from exercising its authority, the\r\noccupant acquires a temporary right of administration over the\r\nrespective territory and its inhabitants. And all steps he takes in the\r\nexercise of this right must be recognised by the legitimate Government\r\nafter occupation has ceased. This administration is in no wise to be\r\ncompared with ordinary administration, for it is distinctly and\r\nprecisely military administration. In carrying it out the occupant is,\r\non the one hand, totally independent of the Constitution and the laws\r\nof the respective territory, since occupation is an aim of warfare, and\r\nsince the maintenance and safety of his forces and the purpose of war\r\nstand in the foreground of his interest and must be promoted under all\r\ncircumstances and conditions. But, although as regards the safety of his\r\narmy and the purpose of war the occupant is vested with an almost\r\nabsolute power, he is not the Sovereign of the territory, and therefore\r\nhas no right to make changes in the laws or in the administration except\r\nthose which are temporarily necessitated by his interest in the\r\nmaintenance and safety of his army and the realisation of the purpose of\r\nwar. On the contrary, he has the duty of administrating the country\r\naccording to the existing laws and the existing rules of administration;\r\nhe must insure public order and safety, must respect family honour and\r\nrights, individual lives, private property, religious convictions and\r\nliberty. Article 43 of the Hague Regulations enacts the following rule\r\nwhich is of fundamental importance: \"The authority of the legitimate\r\nPower having actually passed into the hands of the occupant, the latter\r\nshall take all steps in his power to re-establish and insure, as far as\r\npossible, public order and safety, while respecting, unless absolutely\r\nprevented, the laws in force in the country.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rights of the Occupant regarding the Inhabitants.]\r\n\r\n§ 170. An occupant having authority over the territory, the inhabitants\r\nare under his sway and have to render obedience to his commands.\r\nHowever, the power of the occupant over the inhabitants is not\r\nunrestricted, for articles 23, 44, and 45 of the Hague Regulations\r\nexpressly enact, that he is prohibited from compelling the inhabitants\r\nto take part in military operations against the legitimate Government,\r\nto give information concerning the army of the other belligerent or\r\nconcerning the latter's means of defence, or to take an oath of\r\nallegiance. On the other hand, he may compel them to take an\r\noath--sometimes called an \"oath of neutrality\"--to abstain from taking\r\nup a hostile attitude against the occupant and willingly to submit to\r\nhis legitimate commands; and he may punish them severely for breaking\r\nthis oath. He may make requisitions and demand contributions[332] from\r\nthem, may compel them to render services as drivers, farriers, and the\r\nlike.[333] He may compel them to render services for the repair or the\r\nerection of such roads, buildings, or other works as are necessary for\r\nmilitary operations.[334] He may also collect the ordinary taxes, dues,\r\nand tolls imposed for the benefit of the State by the legitimate\r\nGovernment. But in such case he is, according to article 48 of the Hague\r\nRegulations, obliged to make the collection, as far as possible, in\r\naccordance with the rules in existence and the assessment in force, and\r\nhe is, on the other hand, bound to defray the expenses of the\r\nadministration of the occupied territory on the same scale as that by\r\nwhich the legitimate Government was bound.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 332: See above, §§ 147 and 148.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 333: Formerly he could likewise compel them to render services\r\nas guides, but this is now prohibited by the wording which article 44\r\nreceived from the Second Peace Conference. It should, however, be\r\nmentioned that Germany, Austria-Hungary, Japan, Montenegro, and Russia\r\nhave signed Convention IV. with a reservation against article 44, and\r\nthat in a war with these Powers the old rule is valid that inhabitants\r\nmay be compelled to serve as guides.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 334: See article 52 of the Hague regulations, and _Land\r\nWarfare_, §§ 388-392.]\r\n\r\nWhoever does not comply with his commands, or commits a prohibited act,\r\nmay be punished by him; but article 50 of the Hague Regulations\r\nexpressly enacts the rule that _no general penalty, pecuniary or\r\notherwise, may be inflicted on the population on account of the acts of\r\nindividuals for which it cannot be regarded as collectively\r\nresponsible_. It must, however, be specially observed that this rule\r\ndoes not at all prevent[335] reprisals on the part of belligerents\r\noccupying enemy territory. In case acts of illegitimate warfare are\r\ncommitted by enemy individuals not belonging to the armed forces,\r\nreprisals may be resorted to, although practically innocent individuals\r\nare thereby punished for illegal acts for which they are neither legally\r\nnor morally responsible--for instance, when a village is burned by way\r\nof reprisal for a treacherous attack committed there on enemy soldiers\r\nby some unknown individuals.[336] Nor does this new rule prevent an\r\noccupant from taking hostages[337] in the interest of the safety of the\r\nline of communication threatened by guerillas not belonging to the armed\r\nforces, or for other purposes,[338] although the hostage must suffer for\r\nacts or omissions of others for which he is neither legally nor morally\r\nresponsible.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 335: See Holland, _War_, No. 110, and _Land Warfare_, §§\r\n385-386. See also Zorn, pp. 239-243, where an important interpretation\r\nof article 50 is discussed.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 336: See below, § 248.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 337: But this is a moot point; see below, § 259.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 338: Belligerents sometimes take hostages for the purpose of\r\nsecuring compliance with demands for contributions, requisitions, and\r\nthe like. As long as such hostages obtain the same treatment as\r\nprisoners of war, the practice does not seem to be illegal, although the\r\nHague Regulations do not mention and many publicists condemn it; see\r\nabove, § 116, p. 153, note 1, and below, § 259, p. 319, note 2.]\r\n\r\nIt must be particularly noted that in the treatment of the inhabitants\r\nof enemy territory the occupant need not make any difference between\r\nsuch as are subjects of the enemy and such as are subjects of neutral\r\nStates.[339]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 339: See above,§ 88, and Frankenbach, _Die Rechtsstellung von\r\nneutralen Staatsangehörigen in kriegführenden Staaten_ (1910), pp.\r\n46-50.]\r\n\r\nAnd it must be further observed that, according to British and American\r\nviews--see above, § 100_a_--article 23 (_h_) of the Hague Regulations\r\nprohibits an occupant of enemy territory from declaring extinguished,\r\nsuspended, or unenforceable in a Court of Law the rights and the rights\r\nof action of the inhabitants.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Position of Government Officials and Municipal Functionaries\r\nduring Occupation.]\r\n\r\n§ 171. As through occupation authority over the territory actually\r\npasses into the hands of the occupant, he may for the time of his\r\noccupation depose all Government officials and municipal functionaries\r\nthat have not withdrawn with the retreating enemy. On the other hand, he\r\nmust not compel them by force to carry on their functions during\r\noccupation, if they refuse to do so, except where a military necessity\r\nfor the carrying on of a certain function arises. If they are willing to\r\nserve under him, he may make them take an oath of obedience, but not of\r\nallegiance, and he may not compel them to carry on their functions in\r\nhis name, but he may prevent them from doing so in the name of the\r\nlegitimate Government.[340] Since, according to article 43 of the Hague\r\nRegulations, he has to secure public order and safety, he must\r\ntemporarily appoint other functionaries in case those of the legitimate\r\nGovernment refuse to serve under him, or in case he deposes them for the\r\ntime of the occupation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 340: Many publicists assert that in case an occupant leaves\r\nofficials of the legitimate Government in office, he \"must\" pay them\r\ntheir ordinary salaries. But I cannot see that there is a customary or\r\nconventional rule in existence concerning this point. But it is in an\r\noccupant's own interest to pay such salaries. and he will as a rule do\r\nthis. Only in the case of article 48 of the Hague Regulations is he\r\ncompelled to do it.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Position of Courts of Justice during Occupation.]\r\n\r\n§ 172. The particular position which Courts of Justice have nowadays in\r\ncivilised countries, makes it necessary to discuss their position during\r\noccupation.[341] There is no doubt that an occupant may suspend the\r\njudges as well as other officials. However, if he does suspend them, he\r\nmust temporarily appoint others in their place. If they are willing to\r\nserve under him, he must respect their independence according to the\r\nlaws of the country. Where it is necessary, he may set up military\r\nCourts instead of the ordinary Courts. In case and in so far as he\r\nadmits the administration of justice by the ordinary Courts, he may\r\nnevertheless, so far as it is necessary for military purposes or for the\r\nmaintenance of public order and safety, temporarily alter the laws,\r\nespecially the Criminal Law, on the basis of which justice is\r\nadministered, as well as the laws regarding procedure. He has, however,\r\nno right to constrain the Courts to pronounce their verdicts in his\r\nname, although he need not allow them to pronounce verdicts in the name\r\nof the legitimate Government. A case that happened during the\r\nFranco-German War may serve as an illustration. In September 1870, after\r\nthe fall of the Emperor Napoleon and the proclamation of the French\r\nRepublic, the Court of Appeal at Nancy pronounced its verdicts under the\r\nformula \"In the name of the French Government and People.\" Since Germany\r\nhad not yet recognised the French Republic, the Germans ordered the\r\nCourt to use the formula \"In the name of the High German Powers\r\noccupying Alsace and Lorraine,\" but gave the Court to understand that,\r\nif the Court objected to this formula, they were disposed to admit\r\nanother, and were even ready to admit the formula \"In the name of the\r\nEmperor of the French,\" as the Emperor had not abdicated. The Court,\r\nhowever, refused to pronounce its verdict otherwise than \"In the name of\r\nthe French Government and People,\" and, consequently, suspended its\r\nsittings. There can be no doubt that the Germans had no right to order\r\nthe formula, \"In the name of the High German Powers, &c.,\" to be used,\r\nbut they were certainly not obliged to admit the formula preferred by\r\nthe Court; and the fact that they were disposed to admit another formula\r\nthan that at first ordered ought to have made the Court accept a\r\ncompromise. Bluntschli (§ 547) correctly maintains that the most natural\r\nsolution of the difficulty would have been to use the neutral formula\r\n\"In the name of the Law.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 341: See Petit, _L'Administration de la justice en territoire\r\noccupé_ (1900).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nWARFARE ON SEA\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nON SEA WARFARE IN GENERAL\r\n\r\n  Hall, § 147--Lawrence, §§ 193-194--Westlake, II. pp.\r\n  120-132--Maine, pp. 117-122--Manning, pp. 183-184--Phillimore,\r\n  III. § 347--Twiss, II. § 73--Halleck, II. pp. 80-82--Taylor, §\r\n  547--Wharton, III. §§ 342-345--Wheaton, § 355--Bluntschli, §§\r\n  665-667--Heffter, § 139--Geffcken in Holtzendorff, IV. pp.\r\n  547-548, 571-581--Ullmann, §§ 187-188--Bonfils, Nos. 1268,\r\n  1294-1338--Despagnet, Nos. 647-649--Pradier-Fodéré, VIII.

The purpose of war is the same in the case of warfare on land or\r\non sea--namely, the overpowering of the enemy. But sea warfare serves\r\nthis purpose by attempting the accomplishment of aims different from\r\nthose of land warfare. Whereas the aims of land warfare are defeat of\r\nthe enemy army and occupation of the enemy territory, the aims[342] of\r\nsea warfare are: defeat of the enemy navy; annihilation of the enemy\r\nmerchant fleet; destruction of enemy coast fortifications, and of\r\nmaritime as well as military establishments on the enemy coast; cutting\r\noff intercourse with the enemy coast; prevention of carriage of\r\ncontraband and of rendering unneutral service to the enemy; all kinds\r\nof support to military operations on land, such as protection of a\r\nlanding of troops on the enemy coast; and lastly, defence of the home\r\ncoast and protection to the home merchant fleet.[343] The means by which\r\nbelligerents in sea warfare endeavour to realise these aims are: attack\r\non and seizure of enemy vessels, violence against enemy individuals,\r\nappropriation and destruction of enemy vessels and goods carried by\r\nthem, requisitions and contributions, bombardment of the enemy coast,\r\ncutting of submarine cables, blockade, espionage, treason, ruses,\r\ncapture of neutral vessels carrying contraband or rendering unneutral\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 342: Aims of sea warfare must not be confounded with ends of\r\nwar; see above, § 66.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 343: Article 1 of the U.S. Naval War Code enumerates the\r\nfollowing as aims of sea warfare:--The capture or destruction of the\r\nmilitary and naval forces of the enemy, of his fortifications, arsenals,\r\ndry docks, and dockyards, of his various military and naval\r\nestablishments, and of his maritime commerce; to prevent his procuring\r\nwar material from neutral sources; to aid and assist military operations\r\non land; to protect and defend the national territory, property, and\r\nsea-borne commerce.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lawful and Unlawful Practices of Sea Warfare.]\r\n\r\n§ 174. As regards means of sea warfare, just as regards means of land\r\nwarfare, it must be emphasised that not every practice capable of\r\ninjuring the enemy in offence and defence is lawful. Although no\r\nregulations regarding the laws of war on sea have as yet been enacted by\r\na general law-making treaty as a pendant to the Hague Regulations, there\r\nare treaties concerning special points--such as submarine mines,\r\nbombardment by naval forces, and others--and customary rules of\r\nInternational Law in existence which regulate the matter. Be that as it\r\nmay, the rules concerning sea warfare are in many points identical with,\r\nbut in many respects differ from, the rules in force regarding warfare\r\non land. Therefore, the means of sea warfare must be discussed\r\nseparately in the following sections. But blockade and capture of\r\nvessels carrying contraband and rendering unneutral service to the\r\nenemy, although they are means of warfare against an enemy, are of such\r\nimportance as regards neutral trade that they will be discussed below in\r\nPart III. §§ 368-413.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Objects of the Means of Sea Warfare.]\r\n\r\n§ 175. Whereas the objects against which means of land warfare may be\r\ndirected are innumerable, the number of the objects against which means\r\nof sea warfare are directed is very limited, comprising six objects\r\nonly. The chief object is enemy vessels, whether public or private; the\r\nnext, enemy individuals, with distinction between those taking part in\r\nfighting and others; the third, enemy goods on enemy vessels; the\r\nfourth, the enemy coast; the fifth and sixth, neutral vessels attempting\r\nto break blockade, carrying contraband, or rendering unneutral service\r\nto the enemy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Development of International Law regarding Private Property\r\non Sea.]\r\n\r\n§ 176. It is evident that in times when a belligerent could destroy all\r\npublic and private enemy property he was able to seize, no special rule\r\nexisted regarding private enemy ships and private enemy property carried\r\nby them on the sea. But the practice of sea warfare frequently went\r\nbeyond the limits of even so wide a right, treating neutral goods on\r\nenemy ships as enemy goods, and treating neutral ships carrying enemy\r\ngoods as enemy ships. It was not until the time of the _Consolato del\r\nMare_ in the fourteenth century that a set of clear and definite rules\r\nwith regard to private enemy vessels and private enemy property on sea\r\nin contradistinction to neutral ships and neutral goods was adopted.\r\nAccording to this famous collection of maritime usages observed by the\r\ncommunities of the Mediterranean, there is no doubt that a belligerent\r\nmay seize and appropriate all private enemy ships and goods. But a\r\ndistinction is made in case of either ship or goods being neutral.\r\nAlthough an enemy ship may always be appropriated, neutral goods thereon\r\nhave to be restored to the neutral owners. On the other hand, enemy\r\ngoods on neutral ships may be appropriated, but the neutral ships\r\ncarrying such goods must be restored to their owners. However, these\r\nrules of the _Consolato del Mare_ were not at all generally recognised,\r\nalthough they were adopted by several treaties between single States\r\nduring the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Neither the communities\r\nbelonging to the Hanseatic League, nor the Netherlands and Spain during\r\nthe War of Independence, nor England and Spain during their wars in the\r\nsixteenth century, adopted these rules. And France expressly enacted by\r\nOrdinances of 1543 (article 42) and 1583 (article 69) that neutral goods\r\non enemy ships as well as neutral ships carrying enemy goods should be\r\nappropriated.[344] Although France adopted in 1650 the rules of the\r\n_Consolato del Mare_, Louis XIV. dropped them again by the Ordinance of\r\n1681 and re-enacted that neutral goods on enemy ships and neutral ships\r\ncarrying enemy goods should be appropriated. Spain enacted the same\r\nrules in 1718. The Netherlands, in contradistinction to the _Consolato\r\ndel Mare_, endeavoured by a number of treaties to foster the principle\r\nthat the flag covers the goods, so that enemy goods on neutral vessels\r\nwere exempt from, whereas neutral goods on enemy vessels were subject\r\nto, appropriation. On the other hand, throughout the eighteenth and\r\nduring the nineteenth century down to the beginning of the Crimean War\r\nin 1854, England adhered to the rules of the _Consolato del Mare_. Thus,\r\nno generally accepted rules of International Law regarding private\r\nproperty on sea were in existence.[345] Matters were made worse by\r\nprivateering, which was generally recognised as lawful, and by the fact\r\nthat belligerents frequently declared a coast blockaded without having a\r\nsufficient number of men-of-war on the spot to make the blockade\r\neffective. It was not until the Declaration of Paris in 1856 that\r\ngeneral rules of International Law regarding private property on sea\r\ncame into existence.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 344: _Robe d'ennemy confisque celle d'amy. Confiscantur ex\r\nnavibus res, ex rebus naves._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 345: Boeck, Nos. 3-103, and Geffcken in Holtzendorff, IV. pp.\r\n572-578, give excellent summaries of the facts.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Declaration of Paris.]\r\n\r\n§ 177. Things began to undergo a change with the outbreak of the Crimean\r\nWar in 1854, when all the belligerents proclaimed that they would not\r\nissue Letters of Marque, and when, further, Great Britain declared that\r\nshe would not seize enemy goods on neutral vessels, and when, thirdly,\r\nFrance declared that she would not appropriate neutral goods on enemy\r\nvessels. Although this alteration of attitude on the part of the\r\nbelligerents was originally intended for the Crimean War only and\r\nexceptionally, it led after the conclusion of peace in 1856 to the\r\nfamous and epoch-making Declaration of Paris,[346] which enacted the\r\nfour rules--(1) that privateering is abolished, (2) that the neutral\r\nflag covers enemy goods[347] with the exception of contraband of war,\r\n(3) that neutral goods, contraband of war excepted, are not liable to\r\ncapture under the enemy flag, (4) that blockades, in order to be\r\nbinding, must be effective, which means maintained by a force sufficient\r\nreally to prevent access to the coast of the enemy. Since, with the\r\nexception of a few States such as the United States of America,\r\nColombia, Venezuela, Bolivia, and Uruguay, all members of the Family of\r\nNations are now parties to the Declaration of Paris, it may well be\r\nmaintained that the rules quoted are general International Law, the more\r\nso as the non-signatory Powers have hitherto in practice always acted\r\nin accordance with those rules.[348]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 346: See Martens, _N.R.G._ XV. p. 767, and above, vol. I. §\r\n559.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 347: It has been asserted--see, for instance, Rivier, II. p.\r\n429--that the neutral flag covers only private, not public, enemy\r\nproperty, and therefore that such goods on neutral vessels as belong to\r\nthe State of the enemy may be seized and appropriated. This opinion\r\nwould seem, however, to be untenable in face of the fact that the\r\nDeclaration of Paris speaks of _marchandise neutre_ without any\r\nqualification, only excepting contraband goods, thus protecting the\r\nwhole of the cargo under the neutral flag, contraband excepted. See\r\nbelow, § 319, p. 385, note 3.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 348: That there is an agitation for the abolition of the\r\nDeclaration of Paris has been mentioned above, § 83, p. 100, note 3.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Principle of Appropriation of Private Enemy Vessels and\r\nEnemy Goods thereon.]\r\n\r\n§ 178. The Declaration of Paris did not touch upon the old rule that\r\nprivate enemy vessels and private enemy goods thereon may be seized and\r\nappropriated, and this rule is, therefore, as valid as ever, although\r\nthere is much agitation for its abolition. In 1785 Prussia and the\r\nUnited States of America had already stipulated by article 23 of their\r\nTreaty of Friendship[349] that in case of war between the parties each\r\nother's merchantmen shall not be seized and appropriated. Again, in 1871\r\nthe United States and Italy, by article 12 of their Treaty of\r\nCommerce,[350] stipulated that in case of war between the parties each\r\nother's merchantmen, with the exception of those carrying contraband of\r\nwar or attempting to break a blockade, shall not be seized and\r\nappropriated. In 1823 the United States had already made the proposal to\r\nGreat Britain, France, and Russia[351] for a treaty abrogating the rule\r\nthat enemy merchantmen and enemy goods thereon may be appropriated; but\r\nRussia alone accepted the proposal under the condition that all other\r\nnaval Powers should consent. Again, in 1856,[352] on the occasion of the\r\nDeclaration of Paris, the United States endeavoured to obtain the\r\nvictory of the principle that enemy merchantmen shall not be\r\nappropriated, making it a condition of their accession to the\r\nDeclaration of Paris that this principle should be recognised. But again\r\nthe attempt failed, owing to the opposition of Great Britain.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 349: See Martens, _R._ IV. p. 37. Perels (p. 198) maintains\r\nthat this article has not been adopted by the Treaty of Commerce between\r\nPrussia and the United States of May 1, 1828; but this statement is\r\nincorrect, for article 12 of this treaty--see Martens, _N.R._ VII. p.\r\n615--adopts it expressly.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 350: See Martens, _N.R.G._ 2nd Ser. I. p. 57.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 351: See Wharton, III. § 342, pp. 260-261, and Moore, VII. §\r\n1198, p. 465.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 352: See Wharton, III. § 342, pp. 270-287, and Moore, VII. §\r\n1198, p. 466.]\r\n\r\nAt the outbreak of war in 1866, Prussia and Austria expressly declared\r\nthat they would not seize and appropriate each other's merchantmen. At\r\nthe outbreak of the Franco-German War in 1870, Germany declared French\r\nmerchantmen exempt from capture, but she changed her attitude when\r\nFrance did not act upon the same lines. It should also be mentioned that\r\nalready in 1865 Italy, by article 211 of her Marine Code, enacted that,\r\nin case of war with any other State, enemy merchantmen not carrying\r\ncontraband of war or breaking a blockade shall not be seized and\r\nappropriated, provided reciprocity be granted. And it should further be\r\nmentioned that the United States of America made attempts[353] in vain\r\nto secure immunity from capture to enemy merchantmen and goods on sea at\r\nthe First as well as at the Second Hague Peace Conference.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 353: See Holls, _The Peace Conference at the Hague_, pp.\r\n306-321, and Scott, _Conferences_, pp. 699-707.]\r\n\r\nIt cannot be denied that the constant agitation, since the middle of the\r\neighteenth century, in favour of the abolition of the rule that private\r\nenemy vessels and goods may be captured on the High Seas, might, during\r\nthe second half of the nineteenth century, have met with success but for\r\nthe decided opposition of Great Britain. Public opinion in Great Britain\r\nwas not, and is not, prepared to consent to the abolition of this rule.\r\nAnd there is no doubt that the abolition of the rule would involve a\r\ncertain amount of danger to a country like Great Britain whose position\r\nand power depend chiefly upon her navy. The possibility of annihilating\r\nan enemy's commerce by annihilating his merchant fleet is a powerful\r\nweapon in the hands of a great naval Power. Moreover, if enemy\r\nmerchantmen are not captured, they can be fitted out as cruisers, or at\r\nleast be made use of for the transport of troops, munitions, and\r\nprovisions. Have not several maritime States made arrangements with\r\ntheir steamship companies to secure the building of their Transatlantic\r\nliners according to plans which make these merchantmen easily\r\nconvertible into men-of-war?\r\n\r\nThe argument that it is unjust that private enemy citizens should suffer\r\nthrough having their property seized has no weight in face of the\r\nprobability that fear of the annihilation of its merchant fleet in case\r\nof war may well deter a State intending to go to war from doing so. It\r\nis a matter for politicians, not for jurists, to decide whether Great\r\nBritain must in the interest of self-preservation oppose the abolition\r\nof the rule that sea-borne private enemy property may be confiscated.\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, since the end of the nineteenth century it has not\r\nbeen the attitude of Great Britain alone which stands in the way of the\r\nabolition of the rule. Since the growth of navies among continental\r\nPowers, these Powers have learnt to appreciate the value of the rule in\r\nwar, and the outcry against the capture of merchantmen has become less\r\nloud. To-day, it may perhaps be said that, even if Great Britain were to\r\npropose the abolition of the rule, it is probable that a greater number\r\nof the maritime States would refuse to accede. For it should be noted\r\nthat at the Second Peace Conference, France, Russia, Japan, Spain,\r\nPortugal, Mexico, Colombia, and Panama, besides Great Britain, voted\r\nagainst the abolition of the rule. And there is noticeable a slow, but\r\nconstant, increase in the number of continental publicists[354] who\r\noppose the abolition of the once so much objected to practice of\r\ncapturing enemy merchantmen.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 354: See, for instance, Perels, § 36, pp. 195-198; Röpcke,\r\n_Das Seebeuterecht_ (1904), pp. 36-47; Dupuis, Nos. 29-31; Pillet, p.\r\n119; Giordana, _La proprieta privata nelle guerre maritime, etc._\r\n(1907); Niemeyer, _Prinzipien des Seekriegsrechts_ (1909); Boidin, pp.\r\n144-167.

Be that as it may, the time is not very far distant when the\r\nPowers will perforce come to an agreement on this as on other points of\r\nsea warfare, in a code of regulations regarding sea warfare as a pendant\r\nto the Hague Regulations regarding warfare on land. An initiative step\r\nwas taken by the United States of America by her Naval War Code[355]\r\npublished in 1900, although she withdrew[356] the Code in 1904.\r\nMeanwhile, the Second Peace Conference has produced a number of\r\nConventions dealing with some parts of Sea Warfare, namely: (1) the\r\nConvention (VI.) concerning the status of enemy merchantmen at the\r\noutbreak of hostilities; (2) the Convention (VII.) concerning the\r\nconversion of merchantmen into warships; (3) the Convention (VIII.)\r\nconcerning the laying of automatic submarine contact mines; (4) the\r\nConvention (IX.) concerning the bombardment by naval forces; (5) the\r\nConvention (XI.) concerning restrictions on the exercise of the right of\r\ncapture in maritime war.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 355: See above, vol.

Whereas in land warfare all sorts of violence against enemy\r\nindividuals are the chief means, in sea warfare attack and seizure of\r\nenemy vessels are the most important means. For together with enemy\r\nvessels, a belligerent takes possession of the enemy individuals and\r\nenemy goods thereon, so that he can appropriate vessels and goods, as\r\nwell as detain those enemy individuals who belong to the enemy armed\r\nforces as prisoners of war. For this reason, and compared with attack\r\nand seizure of enemy vessels, violence against enemy persons and the\r\nother means of sea warfare play only a secondary part, although such\r\nmeans are certainly not unimportant. For a weak naval Power can even\r\nrestrict the operations of her fleet to mere coast defence, and thus\r\ntotally refrain from directly attacking and seizing enemy vessels.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Attack when legitimate.]\r\n\r\n§ 181. All enemy men-of-war and other public vessels, which are met by a\r\nbelligerent's men-of-war on the High Seas or within the territorial\r\nwaters of either belligerent,[357] may at once be attacked, and the\r\nattacked vessel may, of course, defend herself by a counter-attack.\r\nEnemy merchantmen may be attacked only if they refuse to submit to visit\r\nafter having been duly signalled to do so. And no duty exists for an\r\nenemy merchantman to submit to visit; on the contrary, she may refuse\r\nit, and defend herself against an attack. But only a man-of-war is\r\ncompetent to attack men-of-war as well as merchantmen, provided the war\r\ntakes place between parties to the Declaration of Paris, so that\r\nprivateering is prohibited. Any merchantman of a belligerent attacking a\r\npublic or private vessel of the enemy would be considered and treated as\r\na pirate, and the members of the crew would be liable to be treated as\r\nwar criminals[358] to the same extent as private individuals committing\r\nhostilities in land warfare. However, if attacked by an enemy vessel, a\r\nmerchantman is competent to deliver a counter-attack and need not\r\ndiscontinue her attack because the vessel which opened hostilities takes\r\nto flight, but may pursue and seize her.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 357: But not, of course, in territorial waters of neutral\r\nStates; see the _De Fortuyn_ (1760), Burrell 175.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 358: See above, § 85, and below, § 254. Should a merchantman,\r\nlegitimately--after having been herself attacked--or illegitimately,\r\nattack an enemy vessel, and succeed in capturing her, the prize, on\r\ncondemnation, becomes _droits_ of Admiralty and, therefore, the property\r\nof the British Government; see article 39 of the Naval Prize Act, 1864,\r\nand article 44 of the Naval Prize Bill introduced in 1911.]\r\n\r\nIt must be specially mentioned that an attack upon enemy vessels on the\r\nsea may be made by forces on the shore. For instance, this is done when\r\ncoast batteries fire upon an enemy man-of-war within reach of their\r\nguns. Enemy merchantmen, however, may not be attacked in this way, for\r\nthey may only be attacked by men-of-war after having been signalled in\r\nvain to submit to visit.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Attack how effected.]\r\n\r\n§ 182. One mode of attack which was in use at the time of sailing ships,\r\nnamely, boarding and fighting the crew, which can be described as a\r\nparallel to assault in land warfare, is no longer used, but if an\r\ninstance occurred, it would be perfectly lawful. Attack is nowadays\r\neffected by cannonade, torpedoes, and, if opportunity arises, by\r\nramming; and nothing forbids an attack on enemy vessels by launching\r\nprojectiles and explosives from air-vessels, provided the belligerents\r\nare not parties to the Declaration--see above, § 114--which prohibits\r\nsuch attacks. As a rule attacks on merchantmen will be made by cannonade\r\nonly, as the attacking vessel aims at seizing her on account of her\r\nvalue. But, in case the attacked vessel not only takes to flight, but\r\ndefends herself by a counter-attack, all modes of attack are lawful\r\nagainst her, just as she herself is justified in applying all modes of\r\nattack by way of defence.\r\n\r\nAs regards attack by torpedoes, article 1 No. 3 of Convention VIII. of\r\nthe Second Peace Conference enacts that it is forbidden to use torpedoes\r\nwhich do not become harmless if they miss their mark.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Submarine Contact Mines.]\r\n\r\n§ 182_a_. A new mode of attack which requires special attention[359] is\r\nthat by means of floating mechanical, in contradistinction to so-called\r\nelectro-contact, mines. The latter need not specially be discussed,\r\nbecause they are connected with a battery on land, can naturally only be\r\nlaid within territorial waters, and present no danger to neutral\r\nshipping except on the spot where they are laid. But floating mechanical\r\nmines can be dropped as well in the Open Sea as in territorial waters;\r\nthey can, moreover, drift away to any distance from the spot where they\r\nwere dropped and thus become a great danger to navigation in general.\r\nMechanical mines were for the first time used, and by both parties, in\r\nthe Russo-Japanese War during the blockade of Port Arthur in 1904, and\r\nthe question of their admissibility was at once raised in the press of\r\nall neutral countries, the danger to neutral shipping being obvious. The\r\nSecond Peace Conference took the matter up and, in spite of the opposing\r\nviews of the Powers, was able to produce the Convention (VIII.)\r\nconcerning the laying of automatic submarine contact mines. This\r\nConvention comprises thirteen articles and was signed, although by some\r\nonly with reservations, by all the Powers represented at the Conference,\r\nexcept China, Montenegro, Nicaragua, Portugal, Russia, Spain, and\r\nSweden. Most of the signatory States have already ratified, and\r\nNicaragua has since acceded. The more important stipulations of this\r\nConvention are the following:--\r\n\r\n(1) Belligerents[360] are forbidden to lay _unanchored_ automatic\r\ncontact mines, unless they be so constructed as to become harmless one\r\nhour at most after those who laid them have lost control over them, and\r\nit is forbidden to lay _anchored_ automatic contact mines which do not\r\nbecome harmless as soon as they have broken loose from their moorings\r\n(article 1).\r\n\r\n(2) It is forbidden to lay automatic contact mines off the coasts and\r\nports of the enemy, with the sole object of intercepting commercial\r\nnavigation (article 2).[361]\r\n\r\n(3) When anchored automatic contact mines are employed, every possible\r\nprecaution must be taken for the security of peaceful navigation. The\r\nbelligerents must provide, as far as possible, for these mines becoming\r\nharmless after a limited time has elapsed, and, where the mines cease to\r\nbe under observation, to notify the danger zones as soon as military\r\nexigencies permit, by notice to mariners, which must also be\r\ncommunicated to the Governments through the diplomatic channel (article\r\n3).\r\n\r\n(4) At the close of the war, each Power must remove the mines laid by\r\nit. As regards anchored automatic contact mines laid by one of the\r\nbelligerents off the coasts of the other, their position must be\r\nnotified to the other party by the Power which laid them, and each Power\r\nmust proceed with the least possible delay to remove the mines in its\r\nown waters (article 5).\r\n\r\n(5) The Convention remains in force for seven years, but, unless\r\ndenounced, it continues in force afterwards (article 11). According to\r\narticle 12, however, the contracting Powers agree to reopen the question\r\nof the employment of automatic contact mines after six and a half years\r\nunless the Third Peace Conference has already taken up and settled the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 359: See Lawrence, _War_, pp. 93-111; Wetzstein, _Die\r\nSeeminenfrage im Völkerrecht_ (1909); Rocholl, _Die Frage der Minen im\r\nSeekrieg_ (1910); Barclay, pp. 59 and 158; Lémonon, pp. 472-502;\r\nHiggins, pp. 328-345; Boidin, pp. 216-235; Dupuis, _Guerre_, Nos.\r\n331-358; Scott, _Conferences_, pp. 576-587; Martitz in the _Report of\r\nthe 23rd Conference (1906) of the International Law Association_, pp.\r\n47-74; Stockton in _A.J._ II. (1908), pp. 276-284.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 360: As regards neutrals, see below, § 363_a_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 361: France and Germany have signed with reservations against\r\narticle 2.]\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that the stipulations of Convention VIII. are totally\r\ninadequate to secure the safety of neutral shipping, and it is for this\r\nreason that Great Britain added the following reservation in signing the\r\nConvention:--\"In placing their signatures to this Convention the British\r\nplenipotentiaries declare that the mere fact that the said Convention\r\ndoes not prohibit a particular act or proceeding must not be held to\r\ndebar His Britannic Majesty's Government from contesting its\r\nlegitimacy.\" It is to be hoped that the Third Peace Conference will\r\nproduce a more satisfactory settlement of the problem. The Institute of\r\nInternational Law studied the matter at its meetings at Paris in 1910\r\nand at Madrid in 1911, and produced a _Règlementation_[362]\r\n_internationale de l'usage des mines sous-marines et torpilles_,\r\ncomprising nine articles, of which the more important are the\r\nfollowing:--\r\n\r\n(1) It is forbidden to place anchored or unanchored automatic mines in\r\nthe Open Sea (the question of the laying of electric contact mines in\r\nthe Open Sea being reserved for future consideration).\r\n\r\n(2) Belligerents may lay mines in their own and in the enemy's\r\nterritorial waters, but it is forbidden (_a_) to lay unanchored\r\nautomatic contact mines which do not become harmless one hour at most\r\nafter those who laid them have lost control over them; (_b_) to lay\r\nanchored automatic contact mines which do not become harmless as soon as\r\nthey have broken loose from their moorings.\r\n\r\n(3) A belligerent is only allowed to lay mines off the coasts and ports\r\nof the enemy for naval and military purposes, he is not allowed to lay\r\nthem there in order to establish or maintain a commercial blockade.\r\n\r\n(4) If mines are laid, all precautions must be taken for the safety of\r\npeaceful navigation, and belligerents must, in especial, provide that\r\nmines become harmless after a limited time has elapsed. In case mines\r\ncease to be under observation the belligerents must, as soon as military\r\nexigencies permit, notify the danger zones to mariners and also to the\r\nGovernments through the diplomatic channel.\r\n\r\n(5) The question as to the laying of mines in straits is reserved for\r\nfuture consideration.\r\n\r\n(6) At the end of the war each Power must remove the mines laid by it.\r\nAs regards anchored automatic contact mines laid by one of the\r\nbelligerents off the coasts of the other, their position must be\r\nnotified to the other party by the Power which laid them, and each Power\r\nmust proceed with the least possible delay to remove the mines in its\r\nown waters. The Power whose duty it is to remove the mines after the war\r\nmust make known the date at which the removal of the mines is complete.\r\n\r\n(7) A violation of these rules involves responsibility on the part of\r\nthe guilty State. The State which has laid the mines is presumed to be\r\nguilty unless the contrary is proved, and an action may be brought\r\nagainst the guilty State, even by individuals who have suffered damage,\r\nbefore the competent International Tribunal.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 362: See _Annuaire_, XXIV. (1911), p. 301.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Duty of giving Quarter.]\r\n\r\n§ 183. As soon as an attacked or counter-attacked vessel hauls down her\r\nflag and, therefore, signals that she is ready to surrender, she must be\r\ngiven quarter and seized without further firing. To continue an attack\r\nalthough she is ready to surrender, and to sink her and her crew, would\r\nconstitute a violation of customary International Law, and would only as\r\nan exception be admissible in case of imperative necessity or of\r\nreprisals.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Seizure.]\r\n\r\n§ 184. Seizure is effected by securing possession of the vessel through\r\nthe captor sending an officer and some of his own crew on board the\r\ncaptured vessel. But if for any reason this is impracticable, the captor\r\norders the captured vessel to lower her flag and to steer according to\r\nhis orders.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effect of Seizure.]\r\n\r\n§ 185. The effect of seizure is different with regard to private enemy\r\nvessels, on the one hand, and, on the other, to public vessels.\r\n\r\nSeizure of _private_ enemy vessels may be described as a parallel to\r\noccupation of enemy territory in land warfare. Since the vessel and the\r\nindividuals and goods thereon are actually placed under the captor's\r\nauthority, her officers and crew, and any private individuals on board,\r\nare for the time being submitted to the discipline of the captor, just\r\nas private individuals on occupied enemy territory are submitted to the\r\nauthority of the occupant.[363] Seizure of private enemy vessels does\r\nnot, however, vest the property finally in the hands of the\r\nbelligerent[364] whose forces effected the capture. The prize has to be\r\nbrought before a Prize Court, and it is the latter's confirmation of\r\nthe capture through adjudication of the prize which makes the\r\nappropriation by the capturing belligerent final.[365]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 363: Concerning the ultimate fate of the crew, see above, §\r\n85.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 364: It is asserted that a captured enemy merchantman may at\r\nonce be converted by the captor into a man-of-war, but the cases of the\r\n_Ceylon_ (1811) and the _Georgina_ (1814), 1 Dodson 105 and 397, which\r\nare quoted in favour of such a practice, are not decisive. See Higgins,\r\n_War and the Private Citizen_ (1912), pp. 138-142.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 365: See below, § 192.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the effect of seizure of _public_ enemy vessels is\r\ntheir immediate and final appropriation. They may be either taken into a\r\nport or at once destroyed. All individuals on board become prisoners of\r\nwar, although, if perchance there should be on board a private enemy\r\nindividual of no importance, he would probably not be kept for long in\r\ncaptivity, but liberated in due time.\r\n\r\nAs regards goods on captured public enemy vessels, there is no doubt\r\nthat the effect of seizure is the immediate appropriation of such goods\r\non the vessels concerned as are enemy property, and these goods may\r\ntherefore be destroyed at once, if desirable. Should, however, neutral\r\ngoods be on board a captured enemy public vessel, it is a moot point\r\nwhether or no they share the fate of the captured ship. According to\r\nBritish practice they do, but according to American practice they do\r\nnot.[366]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 366: See, on the one hand, the _Fanny_ (1814), 1 Dodson, 443,\r\nand, on the other, the _Nereide_ (1815), 9 Cranch, 388. See also below,\r\n§ 424, p. 542 note 2.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Immunity of Vessels charged with Religious, Scientific, or\r\nPhilanthropic Mission.]\r\n\r\n§ 186. Enemy vessels engaged in scientific discovery and exploration\r\nwere, according to a general international usage in existence before the\r\nSecond Peace Conference of 1907, granted immunity from attack and\r\nseizure in so far and so long as they themselves abstained from\r\nhostilities. The usage grew up in the eighteenth century. In 1766, the\r\nFrench explorer Bougainville, who started from St. Malo with the vessels\r\n_La Boudeuse_ and _L'Étoile_ on a voyage round the world, was furnished\r\nby the British Government with safe-conducts. In 1776, Captain Cook's\r\nvessels _Resolution_ and _Discovery_, sailing from Plymouth for the\r\npurpose of exploring the Pacific Ocean, were declared exempt from\r\nattack and seizure on the part of French cruisers by the French\r\nGovernment. Again, the French Count Lapérouse, who started on a voyage\r\nof exploration in 1785 with the vessels _Astrolabe_ and _Boussole_, was\r\nsecured immunity from attack and seizure. During the nineteenth century\r\nthis usage became quite general, and had almost ripened into a custom;\r\nexamples are the Austrian cruiser _Novara_ (1859) and the Swedish\r\ncruiser _Vega_ (1878). No immunity, however, was granted to vessels\r\ncharged with religious or philanthropic missions. A remarkable case\r\noccurred during the Franco-German war. In June, 1871, the _Palme_, a\r\nvessel belonging to the Missionary Society of Basle, was captured by a\r\nFrench man-of-war, and condemned by the Prize Court of Bordeaux. The\r\nowners appealed and the French Conseil d'État set the vessel free, not\r\nbecause the capture was not justified but because equity demanded that\r\nthe fact that Swiss subjects owning sea-going vessels were obliged to\r\nhave them sailing under the flag of another State, should be taken into\r\nconsideration.[367]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 367: See Rivier, II. pp. 343-344; Dupuis, No. 158; and Boeck,\r\nNo. 199.]\r\n\r\nThe Second Peace Conference embodied the previous usage concerning\r\nimmunity of vessels of discovery and exploration in a written rule and\r\nextended the immunity to vessels with a religious or philanthropic\r\nmission, for article 4 of Convention XI. enacts that vessels charged\r\nwith religious, scientific, or philanthropic missions are exempt from\r\ncapture.\r\n\r\nIt must be specially observed that it matters not whether the vessel\r\nconcerned is a private or a public vessel.[368]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 368: See U.S. Naval War Code, article 13. The matter is\r\ndiscussed at some length by Kleen, II. § 210, pp. 503-505. Concerning\r\nthe case of the English explorer Flinders, who sailed with the vessel\r\n_Investigator_ from England, but exchanged her for the _Cumberland_,\r\nwhich was seized in 1803 by the French at Port Louis, in Mauritius, as\r\nshe was not the vessel to which a safe-conduct was given, see Lawrence,\r\n§ 185.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Immunity of Fishing-boats and small boats employed in local\r\nTrade.]\r\n\r\n§ 187. Coast fishing-boats, in contradistinction to boats engaged in\r\ndeep-sea fisheries, were, according to a general, but not universal,\r\ncustom in existence during the nineteenth century, granted immunity from\r\nattack and seizure so long and in so far as they were unarmed and were\r\ninnocently employed in catching and bringing in fish.[369] As early as\r\nthe sixteenth century treaties were concluded between single States\r\nstipulating such immunity to each other's fishing-boats for the time of\r\nwar. But throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries there were\r\ninstances of a contrary practice, and Lord Stowell refused[370] to\r\nrecognise in strict law any such exemption, although he recognised a\r\nrule of comity to that extent. Great Britain has always taken the\r\nstandpoint that any immunity granted by her to fishing-boats was a\r\nrelaxation[371] of strict right in the interest of humanity, but\r\nrevocable at any moment, and that her cruisers were justified in seizing\r\nenemy fishing-boats unless prevented therefrom by special instructions\r\non the part of the Admiralty.[372] But at the Second Peace Conference\r\nshe altered her attitude, and agreed to the immunity not only of fishing\r\nvessels, but also of small boats employed in local trade. Article 3 of\r\nConvention XI. enacts, therefore, that vessels employed exclusively in\r\ncoast fisheries, and small boats employed in local trade, are, together\r\nwith appliances, rigging, tackle, and cargo, exempt from capture.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 369: The _Paquette Habana_ (1899), 175, United States, 677.\r\nSee U.S. Naval War Code, article 14; Japanese Prize Law, article 3 (1).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 370: The _Young Jacob and Joanna_ (1798), 1 C. Rob, 20.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 371: See Hall, § 148.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 372: See Holland, _Prize Law_, § 36.]\r\n\r\nIt must be specially observed that boats engaged in deep-sea fisheries\r\nand large boats engaged in local trade do not enjoy the privilege of\r\nimmunity from capture, and that the fishing vessels and small boats\r\nemployed in local trade lose that privilege in case they take any part\r\nwhatever in hostilities. And article 3 expressly stipulates that\r\nbelligerents must not take advantage of the harmless character of the\r\nsaid boats in order to use them for military purposes while preserving\r\ntheir peaceful appearance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Immunity of Merchantmen at the Outbreak of War on their\r\nVoyage to and from a Belligerent's Port.]\r\n\r\n§ 188. Several times at the outbreak of war during the nineteenth\r\ncentury belligerents decreed that such enemy merchantmen as were on\r\ntheir voyage to one of the former's ports at the outbreak of war, should\r\nnot be attacked and seized during the period of their voyage to and from\r\nsuch port. Thus, at the outbreak of the Crimean War, Great Britain and\r\nFrance decreed such immunity for Russian vessels, Germany did the same\r\nwith regard to French vessels in 1870,[373] Russia with regard to\r\nTurkish vessels in 1877, the United States with regard to Spanish\r\nvessels in 1898, Russia and Japan with regard to each other's vessels in\r\n1904. But there is no rule of International Law which compels a\r\nbelligerent to grant such days of grace, and it is probable that in\r\nfuture wars days of grace will not be granted. The reason is that the\r\nsteamboats of many countries are now built, according to an arrangement\r\nwith the Government of their home State, from special designs which make\r\nthem easily convertible into cruisers, and that a belligerent fleet\r\ncannot nowadays remain effective for long without being accompanied by a\r\ntrain of transport-vessels, colliers, repairing-vessels, and the\r\nlike.[374]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 373: See, however, above, § 178, p. 222.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 374: This point is ably argued by Lawrence, _War_, pp 54-55.]\r\n\r\nIn case, however, merchantmen, other than those constructed on special\r\nlines in order to make them easily convertible into cruisers, are, at\r\nthe outbreak of war, on their voyage to an enemy port and are ignorant\r\nof the outbreak of hostilities, article 3 of Convention VI.[375] of the\r\nSecond Peace Conference must find application. They may not, therefore,\r\nbe confiscated, but may only be captured on condition that they shall\r\nbe restored after the conclusion of peace, or that indemnities shall be\r\npaid for them if they have been requisitioned or destroyed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 375: See above, § 102_a_, Nos. 3 and 4.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Vessels in Distress.]\r\n\r\n§ 189. Instances have occurred when enemy vessels which were forced by\r\nstress of weather to seek refuge in a belligerent's harbour were granted\r\nexemption from seizure.[376] Thus, when in 1746, during war with Spain,\r\nthe _Elisabeth_, a British man-of-war, was forced to take refuge in the\r\nport of Havanna, she was not seized, but was offered facility for\r\nrepairing damages, and furnished with a safe-conduct as far as the\r\nBermudas. Thus, further, when in 1799, during war with France, the\r\n_Diana_, a Prussian merchantman, was forced to take refuge in the port\r\nof Dunkirk and seized, she was restored by the French Prize Court. But\r\nthese and other cases have not created any rule of International Law\r\nwhereby immunity from attack and seizure is granted to vessels in\r\ndistress, and no such rule is likely to grow up, especially not as\r\nregards men-of-war and such merchantmen as are easily convertible into\r\ncruisers.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 376: See Ortolan, II. pp. 286-291; Kleen, II. § 210, pp.\r\n492-494.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Immunity of Hospital and Cartel Ships.]\r\n\r\n§ 190. According to the Hague Convention, which adapted the principles\r\nof the Geneva Convention to warfare on sea, hospital ships are\r\ninviolable, and therefore may be neither attacked nor seized; see below\r\nin §§ 204-209. Concerning the immunity of cartel ships, see below in §\r\n225.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Immunity of Mail-boats and of Mail-bags.]\r\n\r\n§ 191. No general rule of International Law exists granting enemy\r\nmail-boats immunity from attack and seizure, but the several States have\r\nfrequently stipulated such immunity in the case of war by special\r\ntreaties.[377] Thus, for instance, Great Britain and France by article 9\r\nof the Postal Convention of August 30, 1860, and Great Britain and\r\nHolland by article 7 of the Postal Convention of October 14, 1843,\r\nstipulated that all mail-boats navigating between the countries of the\r\nparties shall continue to navigate in time of war between these\r\ncountries without impediment or molestation until special notice be\r\ngiven by either party that the service is to be discontinued.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 377: See Kleen, II. § 210, pp. 505-507.]\r\n\r\nWhereas there is no general rule granting immunity from capture to enemy\r\nmail-boats, enemy _mail-bags_ do, according to article 1 of Convention\r\nXI., enjoy the privilege of such immunity, for it is there enacted that\r\nthe postal correspondence of neutrals or belligerents, whether official\r\nor private in character, which may be found on board a neutral[378] or\r\nenemy ship at sea, is inviolable, and that, in case the ship is\r\ndetained, the correspondence is to be forwarded by the captor with the\r\nleast possible delay. There is only one exception to this rule of\r\narticle 1, for correspondence destined to or proceeding from a blockaded\r\nport does not enjoy the privilege of immunity.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 378: See below, §§ 319 and 411.]\r\n\r\nIt must be specially observed that postal correspondence, and not\r\nparcels sent by parcel post, are immune from capture.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nAPPROPRIATION AND DESTRUCTION OF ENEMY MERCHANTMEN\r\n\r\n  Hall, §§ 149-152, 171, 269--Lawrence, §§ 183-191--Westlake, II.\r\n  pp. 156-160--Phillimore, III. §§ 345-381--Twiss, II. §§\r\n  72-97--Halleck, II. pp. 362-431, 510-526--Taylor, §§\r\n  552-567--Wharton, III. § 345--Wheaton, §§ 355-394--Moore, VII. §§\r\n  1206-1214--Bluntschli, §§ 672-673--Heffter, §§ 137-138--Geffcken\r\n  in Holtzendorff, IV. pp. 588-596--Ullmann, § 189--Bonfils, Nos.\r\n  1396-1440--Despagnet, Nos. 670-682--Pradier-Fodéré, VIII.

See\r\n  also the literature quoted by Bonfils at the commencement of No.\r\n  1396.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Prize Courts.]\r\n\r\n§ 192. It has already been stated above, in § 185, that the capture of a\r\nprivate enemy vessel has to be confirmed by a Prize Court, and that it\r\nis only through the latter's adjudication that the vessel becomes\r\nfinally appropriated. The origin[379] of Prize Courts is to be traced\r\nback to the end of the Middle Ages. During the Middle Ages, after the\r\nRoman Empire had broken up, a state of lawlessness established itself on\r\nthe High Seas. Piratical vessels of the Danes covered the North Sea and\r\nthe Baltic, and navigation of the Mediterranean Sea was threatened by\r\nGreek and Saracen pirates. Merchantmen, therefore, associated themselves\r\nfor mutual protection and sailed as a merchant fleet under a specially\r\nelected chief, the so-called Admiral. They also occasionally sent out a\r\nfleet of armed vessels for the purpose of sweeping pirates from certain\r\nparts of the High Seas. Piratical vessels and goods which were captured\r\nwere divided among the captors according to a decision of their Admiral.\r\nDuring the thirteenth century the maritime States of Europe themselves\r\nendeavoured to keep order on the Open Sea. By-and-by armed vessels were\r\nobliged to be furnished with Letters Patent or Letters of Marque from\r\nthe Sovereign of a maritime State and their captures submitted to the\r\nofficial control of such State as had furnished them with their Letters.\r\nA board, called the Admiralty, was instituted by maritime States, and\r\nofficers of that Board of Admiralty exercised control over the armed\r\nvessels and their captures, inquiring in each case[380] into the\r\nlegitimation of the captor and the nationality of the captured vessel\r\nand her goods. And after modern International Law had grown up, it was a\r\nrecognised customary rule that in time of war the Admiralty of maritime\r\nbelligerents should be obliged to institute a Court[381] or Courts\r\nwhenever a prize was captured by public vessels or privateers in order\r\nto decide whether the capture was lawful or not. These Courts were\r\ncalled Prize Courts. This institution has come down to our times, and\r\nnowadays all maritime States either constitute permanent Prize Courts,\r\nor appoint them specially in each case of an outbreak of war. The whole\r\ninstitution is essentially one in the interest of neutrals, since\r\nbelligerents want to be guarded by a decision of a Court against claims\r\nof neutral States regarding alleged unjustified capture of neutral\r\nvessels and goods. The capture of any private vessel, whether _prima\r\nfacie_ belonging to an enemy or a neutral, must, therefore, be submitted\r\nto a Prize Court. Article 1 of Convention XII. (as yet unratified) of\r\nthe Second Peace Conference now expressly enacts the old customary rule\r\nthat \"the validity of the capture of a merchantman or its cargo, when\r\nneutral or enemy property is involved, is decided before a Prize Court.\"\r\nIt must, however, be emphasised that the ordinary Prize-Courts are not\r\nInternational Courts, but National Courts instituted by Municipal Law,\r\nand that the law they administer is Municipal Law,[382] based on custom,\r\nstatutes, or special regulations of their State. Every State is,\r\nhowever, bound by International Law to enact only such statutes and\r\nregulations[383] for its Prize Courts as are in conformity with\r\nInternational Law. A State may, therefore, instead of making special\r\nregulations, directly order its Prize Courts to apply the rules of\r\nInternational Law, and it is understood that, when no statutes are\r\nenacted or regulations are given, Prize Courts have to apply\r\nInternational Law. Prize Courts may be instituted by belligerents in any\r\npart of their territory or the territories of allies, but not on neutral\r\nterritory. It would nowadays constitute a breach of neutrality on the\r\npart of a neutral State to allow the institution on its territory of a\r\nPrize Court.[384]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 379: I follow the excellent summary of the facts given by\r\nTwiss, II. §§ 74-75, but Marsden's articles in _The English Historical\r\nReview_, XXIV.

(1911), p. 34,\r\nmust likewise be referred to.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 380: The first case that is mentioned as having led to\r\njudicial proceedings before the Admiral in England dates from 1357; see\r\nMarsden, _loc. cit._ XXIV.

The Naval\r\nPrize Bill introduced by the British Government in 1911, although\r\naccepted by the House of Commons, was thrown out by the House of\r\nLords.--It should be mentioned that the Institute of International Law\r\nhas in various meetings occupied itself with the whole matter of\r\ncapture, and adopted a body of rules in the _Règlement international des\r\nPrises Maritimes_, which represent a code of Prize Law; see _Annuaire_,\r\nIX. pp. 218-243, but also XVI. pp. 44 and 311.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 384: See below, § 327, and article 4 of Convention XIII. of\r\nthe Second Peace Conference.]\r\n\r\nWhereas the ordinary Prize Courts are national courts, Convention\r\nXII.--as yet unratified--of the Second Peace Conference, provides for\r\nthe establishment of an International[385] Prize Court at the Hague,\r\nwhich, in certain matters, is to serve as a Court of Appeal in prize\r\ncases. In these cases jurisdiction in matters of prize is exercised, in\r\nthe first instance, by the Prize Courts of belligerents (article 2),\r\nbut, according to article 6, the national Prize Courts may not deal with\r\nany case in which there is a second appeal; since such cases necessarily\r\ncome before the International Prize Court at the second appeal. This\r\nmeans that belligerents, besides Prize Courts of the first instance, may\r\nset up a Prize Court of Appeal, but they may not set up a second Court\r\nof Appeal above the first, except in cases in which the International\r\nPrize Court has no jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 385: See above, vol. I. § 476_a_, and below, §§ 442-447.]\r\n\r\nIt must be specially observed that the proposed International Prize\r\nCourt--see articles 3 and 4--is, in the main, a Court to decide between\r\nbelligerents and neutrals, and not between two belligerents.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Conduct of Prize to port of Prize Court.]\r\n\r\n§ 193. As soon as a vessel is seized she must be conducted to a port\r\nwhere a Prize Court is sitting. As a rule the officer and the crew sent\r\non board the prize by the captor will navigate the prize to the port.\r\nThis officer can ask the master and crew of the vessel to assist him,\r\nbut, if they refuse, they may not be compelled thereto. The captor need\r\nnot accompany the prize to the port. In the exceptional case, however,\r\nwhere an officer and crew cannot be sent on board and the captured\r\nvessel is ordered to lower her flag and to steer according to orders,\r\nthe captor must conduct the prize to the port. To which port a prize is\r\nto be taken is not for International Law to determine; the latter says\r\nonly that the prize must be taken straight to a port of a Prize Court,\r\nand only in case of distress or necessity is delay allowed. If the\r\nneutral State concerned gives permission,[386] the prize may, in case\r\nof distress or in case she is in such bad condition as prevents her from\r\nbeing taken to a port of a Prize Court, be taken to a near neutral port,\r\nand, if admitted, the capturing man-of-war as well as the prize enjoy\r\nthere the privilege of exterritoriality. But as soon as circumstances\r\nallow, the prize must be conducted from the neutral port to that of the\r\nPrize Court, and only if the condition of the prize does not at all\r\nallow this, may the Prize Court give its verdict in the absence of the\r\nprize after the ship papers of the prize and witnesses have been\r\nproduced before it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 386: See below, § 328, and articles 21-23 of Convention XIII.\r\nof the Second Peace Conference.]\r\n\r\nThe whole of the crew of the prize are, as a rule, to be kept on board\r\nand to be brought before the Prize Court. But if this is impracticable,\r\nseveral important members of the crew, such as the master, mate, or\r\nsupercargo, must be kept on board, whereas the others may be removed and\r\nforwarded to the port of the Prize Court by other means of transport.\r\nThe whole of the cargo is, as a rule, also to remain on board the prize.\r\nBut if the whole or part of the cargo is in a condition which prevents\r\nit from being sent to the port of the Prize Court, it may, according to\r\nthe needs of the case, either be destroyed or sold in the nearest port,\r\nand in the latter case an account of the sale has to be sent to the\r\nPrize Court. All neutral goods amongst the cargo are also to be taken to\r\nthe port of adjudication, although they have now, according to the\r\nDeclaration of Paris, to be restored to their neutral owners. But if\r\nsuch neutral goods are not in a condition to be taken to the port of\r\nadjudication, they may likewise be sold or destroyed, as the case may\r\nrequire.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Destruction of Prize.]\r\n\r\n§ 194. Since through adjudication by the Prize Courts the ownership of\r\ncaptured private enemy vessels becomes finally transferred to the\r\nbelligerent whose forces made the capture, it is evident that after\r\ntransfer the captured vessel as well as her cargo may be destroyed. On\r\nthe other hand, it is likewise evident that, since a verdict of a Prize\r\nCourt is necessary before the appropriation of the prize becomes final,\r\na captured merchantman must not as a rule be destroyed instead of being\r\nconducted to the port of a Prize Court. There are, however, exceptions\r\nto the rule, but no unanimity exists in theory or practice as regards\r\nthose exceptions. Whereas some[387] consider the destruction of a prize\r\nallowable only in case of imperative necessity, others[388] allow it in\r\nnearly every case of convenience. Thus, the Government of the United\r\nStates of America, on the outbreak of war with England in 1812,\r\ninstructed the commanders of her vessels to destroy at once all\r\ncaptures, the very valuable excepted, because a single cruiser, however\r\nsuccessful, could man a few prizes only, but by destroying each capture\r\nwould be able to continue capturing, and thereby constantly diminish the\r\nenemy merchant fleet.[389] During the Civil War in America the cruisers\r\nof the Southern Confederated States destroyed all enemy prizes because\r\nthere was no port open for them to bring prizes to. And during the\r\nRusso-Japanese War, Russian cruisers destroyed twenty-one captured\r\nJapanese merchantmen.[390] According to British practice,[391] the\r\ncaptor is allowed to destroy the prize in only two cases--namely, first,\r\nwhen the prize is in such a condition as prevents her from being sent to\r\nany port of adjudication; and, secondly, when the capturing vessel is\r\nunable to spare a prize crew to navigate the prize into such a port.\r\nThe _Règlement international des prises maritimes_ of the Institute of\r\nInternational Law enumerates in § 50 five cases in which destruction of\r\nthe capture is allowed--namely (1) when the condition of the vessel and\r\nthe weather make it impossible to keep the prize afloat; (2) when the\r\nvessel navigates so slowly that she cannot follow the captor and is\r\ntherefore exposed to an easy recapture by the enemy; (3) when the\r\napproach of a superior enemy force creates the fear that the prize might\r\nbe recaptured by the enemy; (4) when the captor cannot spare a prize\r\ncrew; (5) when the port of adjudication to which the prize might be\r\ntaken is too far from the spot where the capture was made. Be that as it\r\nmay,[392] in every case of destruction of the vessel the captor must\r\nremove crew, ship papers, and, if possible, the cargo, before the\r\ndestruction of the prize, and must afterwards send crew, papers, and\r\ncargo to a port of a Prize Court for the purpose of satisfying the\r\nlatter that both the capture and the destruction were lawful.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 387: See, for instance, Bluntschli, § 672.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 388: See, for instance, Martens, § 126, who moreover makes no\r\ndifference between the prize being an enemy or a neutral ship.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 389: U.S. Naval War Code (article 14) allows the destruction\r\n\"in case of military or other necessity.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 390: See Takahashi, pp. 284-310.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 391: The _Actaeon_ (1815), 2 Dod. 48; the _Felicity_ (1819), 2\r\nDod. 381; the _Leucade_ (1855), Spinks, 217. See also Holland, _Prize\r\nLaw_, §§ 303-304.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 392: The whole matter is thoroughly discussed by Boeck, Nos.\r\n268-285; Dupuis, Nos. 262-268; and Calvo, V. §§ 3028-3034. As regards\r\ndestruction of a neutral prize, see below, § 431.]\r\n\r\nBut if destruction of a captured enemy merchantman can as an exception\r\nbe lawful, the question as to indemnities to be paid to the neutral\r\nowners of goods carried by the destroyed vessel requires attention. It\r\nseems to be obvious that, if the destruction of the vessel herself was\r\nlawful, and if it was not possible to remove her cargo, no indemnities\r\nneed be paid. An illustrative case happened during the Franco-German\r\nWar. On October 21, 1870, the French cruiser _Dessaix_ seized two German\r\nmerchantmen, the _Ludwig_ and the _Vorwärts_, but burned them because\r\nshe could not spare a prize crew to navigate the prizes into a French\r\nport. The neutral owners of part of the cargo claimed indemnities, but\r\nthe French Conseil d'État refused to grant indemnities on the ground\r\nthat the action of the captor was lawful.[393]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 393: See Boeck, No. 146; Barboux, p. 153; Calvo, V. § 3033;\r\nDupuis, No. 262; Hall, § 269. Should the International Prize Court at\r\nthe Hague be established, article 3 of Convention XII. of the Second\r\nPeace Conference would enable the owners of neutral goods destroyed with\r\nthe destroyed enemy merchantmen that carried them to bring the question\r\nas to whether they may claim damages before this Court.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ransom of Prize.]\r\n\r\n§ 195. Although prizes have as a rule to be brought before a Prize\r\nCourt, International Law nevertheless does not forbid the ransoming of\r\nthe captured vessel either directly after the capture or after she has\r\nbeen conducted to the port of a Prize Court, but before the Court has\r\ngiven its verdict. However, the practice of accepting and paying ransom,\r\nwhich grew up in the seventeenth century, is in many countries now\r\nprohibited by Municipal Law. Thus, for instance, Great Britain by\r\nsection 45 of the Naval Prize Act, 1864, prohibits ransoming except in\r\nsuch cases as may be specially provided for by an Order of the King in\r\nCouncil.[394] Where ransom is accepted, a contract of ransom is entered\r\ninto by the captor and the master of the captured vessel; the latter\r\ngives a so-called ransom bill to the former, in which he promises the\r\namount of the ransom. He is given a copy of the ransom bill for the\r\npurpose of a safe-conduct to protect his vessel from again being\r\ncaptured, under the condition that he keeps the course to such port as\r\nis agreed upon in the ransom bill. To secure the payment of ransom, an\r\nofficer of the captured vessel can be detained as hostage, otherwise the\r\nwhole of the crew is to be liberated with the vessel, ransom being an\r\nequivalent for both the restoration of the prize and the release of her\r\ncrew from captivity. So long as the ransom bill is not paid, the hostage\r\ncan be kept in captivity. But it is exclusively a matter for the\r\nMunicipal Law of the State concerned to determine whether or no the\r\ncaptor can sue upon the ransom bill, if the ransom is not voluntarily\r\npaid.[395] Should the capturing vessel, with the hostage or the ransom\r\nbill on board, be captured herself and thus become a prize of the enemy,\r\nthe hostage is liberated, the ransom bill loses its effect, and need not\r\nbe paid.[396]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 394: Article 40 of the Naval Prize Bill of 1911 runs as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n  (1) His Majesty in Council may, in relation to any war, make such\r\n  orders as may seem expedient according to circumstances for\r\n  prohibiting or allowing, wholly or in certain cases or subject to\r\n  any conditions or regulations or otherwise as may from time to\r\n  time seem meet, the ransoming or the entering into any contract or\r\n  agreement for the ransoming of any ship or goods belonging to any\r\n  of His Majesty's subjects, and taken as prize by any of His\r\n  Majesty's enemies.\r\n\r\n  (2) Any contract or agreement entered into, and any bill, bond, or\r\n  other security given for ransom of any ship or goods, shall be\r\n  under the exclusive jurisdiction of the High Court as a Prize\r\n  Court (subject to appeal to the Supreme Prize Court) and if\r\n  entered into or given in contravention to any such Order in\r\n  Council shall be deemed to have been entered into or given for an\r\n  illegal consideration.\r\n\r\n  (3) If any person ransoms or enters into any contract or agreement\r\n  for ransoming any ship or goods, in contravention of any such\r\n  Order in Council, he shall for every such offence be liable to be\r\n  proceeded against in the High Court at the suit of His Majesty in\r\n  his office of Admiralty, and on conviction to be fined, in the\r\n  discretion of the Court, any sum not exceeding five hundred\r\n  pounds.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 395: See Hall, § 151, p. 479:--\"The English Courts refuse to\r\naccept such arrangements (for ransom) from the effect of the rule that\r\nthe character of an alien enemy carries with it a disability to sue, and\r\ncompel payment of the debt indirectly through an action brought by the\r\nimprisoned hostage for the recovery of his freedom.\" The American\r\nCourts, in contradistinction to the British, recognise ransom bills. See\r\non the one hand, the case of _Cornu_ v. _Blackburne_ (1781), 2 Douglas,\r\n640, _Anthon_ v. _Fisher_ (1782), 2 Douglas, 649 note, the _Hoop_, 1 C.\r\nRob. 201; and, on the other, _Goodrich_ and _De Forest_ v. _Gordon_\r\n(1818), 15 Johnson, 6.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 396: The matter of ransom is treated with great lucidity by\r\nTwiss, II. §§ 180-183; Boeck, Nos. 257-267; Dupuis, Nos. 269-277.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Loss of Prize, especially Recapture.]\r\n\r\n§ 196. A prize is lost--(1) when the captor intentionally abandons her,\r\n(2) when she escapes through being rescued by her own crew, or (3) when\r\nshe is recaptured. Just as through capture the prize becomes, according\r\nto International Law, the property of the belligerent whose forces made\r\nthe capture, provided a Prize Court confirms the capture, so such\r\nproperty is lost when the prize vessel becomes abandoned, or escapes, or\r\nis recaptured. And it seems to be obvious, and everywhere recognised by\r\nMunicipal Law, that as soon as a captured enemy merchantman succeeds in\r\nescaping, the proprietorship of the former owners revives _ipso facto_.\r\nBut the case is different when a captured vessel, whose crew has been\r\ntaken on board the capturing vessel, is abandoned and afterwards met and\r\ntaken possession of by a neutral vessel or by a vessel of her home\r\nState. It is certainly not for International Law to determine whether or\r\nnot the original proprietorship revives through abandonment. This is a\r\nmatter for Municipal Law. The case of recapture is different from\r\nescape. Here too Municipal Law has to determine whether or no the former\r\nproprietorship revives, since International Law lays down the rule only\r\nthat recapture takes the vessel out of the property of the enemy and\r\nbrings her into the property of the belligerent whose forces made the\r\nrecapture. Municipal Law of the individual States has settled the matter\r\nin different ways. Thus, Great Britain, by section 40 of the Naval Prize\r\nAct, 1864, enacted that the recaptured vessel, except when she has been\r\nused by the captor as a ship of war, shall be restored to her former\r\nowner on his paying one-eighth to one-fourth, as the Prize Court may\r\naward, of her value as prize salvage, no matter if the recapture was\r\nmade before or after the enemy Prize Court had confirmed the\r\ncapture.[397] Other States restore a recaptured vessel only when the\r\nrecapture was made within twenty-four hours[398] after the capture\r\noccurred, or before the captured vessel was conducted into an enemy\r\nport, or before she was condemned by an enemy Prize Court.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 397: Article 30 of the Naval Prize Bill introduced in 1911\r\nsimply enacts that British merchantmen or goods captured by the enemy\r\nand recaptured by a British man-of-war shall be restored to the owner by\r\na decree of the Prize Court.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 398: So, for instance, France; see Dupuis, Nos. 278-279.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fate of Prize.]\r\n\r\n§ 197. Through being captured and afterwards condemned by a Prize Court,\r\na captured enemy vessel and captured enemy goods become the property of\r\nthe belligerent whose forces made the capture. What becomes of the\r\nprize after the condemnation is not for International, but for Municipal\r\nLaw to determine. A belligerent can hand the prize over to the officers\r\nand crew who made the capture, or can keep her altogether for himself,\r\nor can give a share to those who made the capture. As a rule, prizes are\r\nsold after they are condemned, and the whole or a part of the net\r\nproceeds is distributed among the officers and crew who made the\r\ncapture. For Great Britain this distribution is regulated by the \"Royal\r\nProclamation as to Distribution of Prize Money\" of August 3, 1886.[399]\r\nThere is no doubt whatever that, if a neutral subject buys a captured\r\nship after her condemnation, she may not be attacked and captured by the\r\nbelligerent to whose subject she formerly belonged, although, if she is\r\nbought by an enemy subject and afterwards captured, she might be\r\nrestored[400] to her former owner.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 399: See Holland, _Prize Law_, pp. 142-150.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 400: See above, § 196.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Vessels belonging to Subjects of Neutral States, but sailing\r\nunder Enemy Flag.]\r\n\r\n§ 198. It has been already stated above in § 89 that merchantmen owned\r\nby subjects of neutral States but sailing under enemy flag are vested\r\nwith enemy character. It is, therefore, evident that they may be\r\ncaptured and condemned. As at present no non-littoral State has a\r\nmaritime flag, vessels belonging to subjects of such States are forced\r\nto navigate under the flag of another State,[401] and they are,\r\ntherefore, in case of war exposed to capture.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 401: See above, vol. I. § 261.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effect of Sale of Enemy Vessels during War.]\r\n\r\n§ 199. Since enemy vessels are liable to capture, the question must be\r\ntaken into consideration whether the fact that an enemy vessel has been\r\nsold during the war to a subject of a neutral or to a subject of the\r\nbelligerent State whose forces seized her, has the effect of excluding\r\nher appropriation. It is obvious that, if the question is answered in\r\nthe affirmative, the owners of enemy vessels can evade the danger of\r\nhaving their property captured by selling their vessels. The question\r\nof transfer of enemy vessels must, therefore, be regarded as forming\r\npart of the larger questions of enemy character and has consequently\r\nbeen treated in detail above, § 91.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Goods sold by and to Enemy Subjects during War.]\r\n\r\n§ 200. If a captured enemy vessel carries goods consigned by enemy\r\nsubjects to subjects of neutral States, or to subjects of the\r\nbelligerent whose forces captured the vessel, they may not be\r\nappropriated, provided the consignee can prove that he is the owner. As\r\nregards such goods found on captured enemy merchantmen as are consigned\r\nto enemy subjects but have been sold _in transitu_ to subjects of\r\nneutral States, no unanimous practice of the different States is in\r\nexistence. The subject of goods sold _in transitu_ must--in the same way\r\nas the question of transfer of enemy vessels--be considered as forming\r\npart of the larger question of enemy character. It has, for this reason,\r\nbeen treated above, § 92.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nVIOLENCE AGAINST ENEMY PERSONS\r\n\r\n  See the literature quoted above at the commencement of § 107. See\r\n  also Bonfils, Nos. 1273-1273'3.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Violence against Combatants.]\r\n\r\n§ 201. As regards killing and wounding combatants in sea warfare and the\r\nmeans used for the purpose, customary rules of International Law are in\r\nexistence according to which only those combatants may be killed or\r\nwounded who are able and willing to fight or who resist capture. Men\r\ndisabled by sickness or wounds, or such men as lay down arms and\r\nsurrender or do not resist capture, must be given quarter, except in a\r\ncase of imperative necessity or of reprisals. Poison, and such arms,\r\nprojectiles, and materials as cause unnecessary injury, are prohibited,\r\nas is also killing and wounding in a treacherous way.[402] The\r\nDeclaration of St. Petersburg[403] and the Hague Declaration prohibiting\r\nthe use of expanding (Dum-Dum)[404] bullets, apply to sea warfare as\r\nwell as to land warfare, as also do the Hague Declarations concerning\r\nprojectiles and explosives launched from balloons, and projectiles\r\ndiffusing asphyxiating or deleterious gases.[405]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 402: See the corresponding rules for warfare on land, which\r\nare discussed above in §§ 108-110. See also U.S. Naval War Code, article\r\n3.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 403: See above,§ 111.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 404: See above, § 112.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 405: See above, §§ 113 and 114.]\r\n\r\nAll combatants, and also all officers and members of the crews of\r\ncaptured merchantmen, could formerly[406] be made prisoners of war.\r\nAccording to articles 5 to 7 of Convention XI. of the Second Peace\r\nConference--see above in § 85--such members of the crews as are subjects\r\nof neutral States may never be made prisoners of war; but the captain,\r\nofficers, and members of the crews who are enemy subjects, and, further,\r\nthe captain and officers who are subjects of neutral States may be made\r\nprisoners of war in case they refuse to be released on parole. As soon\r\nas such prisoners are landed, their treatment falls under articles 4-20\r\nof the Hague Regulations; but as long as they are on board, the old\r\ncustomary rule of International Law, that prisoners must be treated\r\nhumanely,[407] and not like convicts, must be complied with. The Hague\r\nConvention for the adaptation of the Geneva Convention to sea warfare\r\nenacts, however, some particular rules concerning the shipwrecked, the\r\nwounded, and the sick who, through falling into the hands of the enemy,\r\nbecome prisoners of war.[408]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 406: This was almost generally recognised, but was refused\r\nrecognition by Count Bismarck during the Franco-German War (see below, §\r\n249) and by some German publicists, as, for instance, Lueder in\r\nHoltzendorff, IV. p. 479, note 6.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 407: See Holland, _Prize Law_, § 249, and U.S. Naval War Code,\r\narticles 10, 11.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 408: See below, § 205.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Violence against Non-combatant Members of Naval Forces.]\r\n\r\n§ 202. Just as military forces consist of combatants and\r\nnon-combatants, so do the naval forces of belligerents. Non-combatants,\r\nas, for instance, stokers, surgeons, chaplains, members of the hospital\r\nstaff, and the like, who do not take part in the fighting, may not be\r\nattacked directly and killed or wounded.[409] But they are exposed to\r\nall injuries indirectly resulting from attacks on or by their vessels.\r\nAnd they may certainly be made prisoners of war, with the exception of\r\nmembers of the religious, medical, and hospital staff, who are\r\ninviolable according to article 10 of the Hague Convention for the\r\nadaptation to maritime warfare of the principles of the Geneva\r\nConvention.[410]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 409: See U.S. Naval War Code, article 3.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 410: See below, § 209.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Violence against Enemy Individuals not belonging to the Naval\r\nForces.]\r\n\r\n§ 203. Since and so far as enemy individuals on board an attacked or\r\nseized enemy vessel who do not belong to the naval forces do not take\r\npart in the fighting, they may not directly be attacked and killed or\r\nwounded, although they are exposed to all injury indirectly resulting\r\nfrom an attack on or by their vessel. If they are mere private\r\nindividuals, they may as an exception only and under the same\r\ncircumstances as private individuals on occupied territory be made\r\nprisoners of war.[411] But they are nevertheless, for the time they are\r\non board the captured vessel, under the discipline of the captor. All\r\nrestrictive measures against them which are necessary are therefore\r\nlawful, as are also punishments, in case they do not comply with lawful\r\norders of the commanding officer. If they are enemy officials in\r\nimportant positions,[412] they may be made prisoners of war.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 411: See U.S. Naval War Code, article 11, and above, § 116.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 412: See above, § 117.]\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nTREATMENT OF WOUNDED AND SHIPWRECKED\r\n\r\n  Perels, § 37--Pillet, pp. 188-191--Westlake, II. pp.\r\n  275-280--Moore, VII. § 1178--Bernsten, § 12--Bonfils, Nos.\r\n  1280-1280'9--Pradier-Fodéré, VIII.

Soon after the ratification of the Geneva Convention the\r\nnecessity of adapting its principles to naval warfare was generally\r\nrecognised, and among the non-ratified Additional articles to the Geneva\r\nConvention of 1868 were nine which aimed at such an adaptation. But it\r\nwas not until the Hague Peace Conference in 1899 that an adaptation came\r\ninto legal existence. This adaptation was contained in the\r\n\"Convention[413] for the Adaptation to Maritime Warfare of the\r\nPrinciples of the Geneva Convention of August 22, 1864,\" which comprised\r\nfourteen articles. It has, however, been replaced by the \"Convention\r\n(X.) for the Adaptation of the Principles of the Geneva Convention to\r\nMaritime War,\" of the Second Hague Peace Conference. This new convention\r\ncomprises twenty-eight articles and was signed, although with some\r\nreservations, by all the Powers represented at the Conference, except\r\nNicaragua which acceded later, and it has already been ratified by most\r\nof the signatory Powers. It provides rules concerning the wounded,\r\nsick, shipwrecked, and dead; hospital ships; sickbays on men-of-war; the\r\ndistinctive colour and emblem of hospital ships; neutral vessels taking\r\non board belligerent wounded, sick, or shipwrecked; the religious,\r\nmedical, and hospital staff of captured ships; the carrying out of the\r\nconvention, and the prevention of abuses and infractions.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 413: Martens, _N.R.G._ 2nd Ser. XXVI. p. 979.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Wounded, Sick, and Shipwrecked.]\r\n\r\n§ 205. Soldiers, sailors, and other persons officially attached to\r\nfleets or armies, whatever their nationality, who are taken on board\r\nwhen sick or wounded, must be respected and tended by the captors\r\n(article 11). All enemy shipwrecked, sick, or wounded who fall into the\r\npower of a belligerent are prisoners of war. It is left to the captor to\r\ndetermine whether they are to be kept on board, or to be sent to a port\r\nof his own country, or a neutral port, or even a hostile port; and in\r\nthe last case such repatriated prisoners must be prevented by their\r\nGovernment from again serving in the war (article 14). The shipwrecked,\r\nwounded, or sick, who are landed at a neutral port with the consent of\r\nthe local authorities, must, unless there is an arrangement to the\r\ncontrary between the neutral State concerned and the belligerent States,\r\nbe guarded by the neutral State so as to prevent them from again taking\r\npart in the war;[414] the expenses of tending and interning them must be\r\nborne by the State to whom they belong (article 15). After each\r\nengagement, both belligerents must, so far as military interests permit,\r\ntake measures to search for the shipwrecked, wounded, and sick, and to\r\nensure them protection against pillage and maltreatment (article 16).\r\nEach belligerent must, as early as possible, send to the authorities of\r\ntheir country, navy, or army, a list of the names of the sick and\r\nwounded picked up by him; and the belligerents must keep each other\r\ninformed as to internments and transfers as well as to admissions into\r\nhospital and deaths which have occurred amongst the sick and wounded in\r\ntheir hands. And they must collect all objects of personal use,\r\nvaluables, letters, &c., that are found in the captured ships in order\r\nto have them forwarded to the persons concerned by the authorities of\r\ntheir own country (article 17).\r\n\r\n[Footnote 414: See below, § 348_a_.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Treatment of the Dead.]\r\n\r\n§ 205_a_. After each engagement both belligerents must, so far as\r\nmilitary interests permit, take measures to ensure the dead protection\r\nagainst pillage and maltreatment, and they must see that the burial,\r\nwhether by land or sea, or cremation of the dead is preceded by a\r\ncareful examination of the corpses in order to determine that life is\r\nreally extinct (article 16). Each belligerent must, as early as\r\npossible, send to the authorities of their country, navy, or army, the\r\nmilitary identification marks or tokens found on the dead; they must\r\nalso collect all the objects of personal use, valuables, letters, &c.,\r\nwhich have been left by the wounded and sick who die in hospital, in\r\norder that they may be forwarded to the persons concerned by the\r\nauthorities of their own country (article 17).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hospital Ships.]\r\n\r\n§ 206. Three different kinds of hospital ships must be\r\ndistinguished--namely, military hospital ships, hospital ships equipped\r\nby private individuals or relief societies of the belligerents, and\r\nhospital ships equipped by private neutral individuals and neutral\r\nrelief societies.\r\n\r\n(1) Military hospital ships (article 1) are ships constructed or\r\nassigned by States specially and solely for the purpose of assisting the\r\nwounded, sick, and shipwrecked. Their names must be communicated to the\r\nbelligerents at the commencement of or during hostilities, and in any\r\ncase before they are employed. They must be respected by the\r\nbelligerents, they may not be captured while hostilities last, and they\r\nare not on the same footing as men-of-war during their stay in a\r\nneutral port.\r\n\r\n(2) Hospital ships equipped wholly or in part at the cost of private\r\nindividuals or officially recognised relief societies of the\r\nbelligerents must be respected by either belligerent (article 2), and\r\nare exempt from capture, provided their home State has given them an\r\nofficial commission and has notified their names to the other\r\nbelligerent at the commencement of or during hostilities, and in any\r\ncase before they are employed. They must, further, be furnished with a\r\ncertificate from the competent authorities declaring that they had been\r\nunder the latter's control while fitting out and on final departure.\r\n\r\n(3) Hospital ships, equipped wholly or in part at the cost of private\r\nindividuals or officially recognised relief societies of neutral States\r\n(article 3), must likewise be respected, and are exempt from capture,\r\nprovided that they are placed under the control of one of the\r\nbelligerents, with the previous consent of their own Government and with\r\nthe authorisation of the belligerent himself, and that the latter has\r\nnotified their names to his adversary at the commencement of, or during,\r\nhostilities, and in any case before they are employed.\r\n\r\nAccording to article 4 all military and other hospital ships must afford\r\nrelief and assistance to the wounded, sick, and shipwrecked of either\r\nbelligerent. The respective Governments are prohibited from using these\r\nships for any military purpose. The commanders of these vessels must not\r\nin any way hamper the movements of the combatants, and during and after\r\nan engagement they act at their own risk and peril. Both belligerents\r\nhave a right to control and visit all military and other hospital ships,\r\nto refuse their assistance, to order them off, to make them take a\r\ncertain course, to put a commissioner on board, and, lastly, to detain\r\nthem temporarily, if important circumstances require this. In case a\r\nhospital ship receives orders from a belligerent, these orders must, as\r\nfar as possible, be inscribed in the ship papers.\r\n\r\nThe protection to which hospital ships are entitled ceases if they are\r\nmade use of to commit acts harmful to the enemy[415] (article 8). But\r\nthe fact of the staff being armed for the purpose of maintaining order\r\nand defending the wounded and sick, and the fact of the presence of\r\nwireless telegraphic apparatus on board, are not sufficient reasons for\r\nwithdrawing protection.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 415: An interesting case of this kind occurred during the\r\nRusso-Japanese war. The _Aryol_ (also called the _Orel_), a hospital\r\nship of the Russian Red Cross Society, was captured, and afterwards\r\ncondemned by the Prize Court on the following grounds:--(_a_) For having\r\ncommunicated the orders of the commander-in-chief of the Russian\r\nsquadron with which she was sailing to other Russian vessels; (_b_) for\r\ncarrying, by order of the commander-in-chief of the squadron, in order\r\nto take them to Vladivostock, the master and some members of the crew of\r\nthe British steamship _Oldhamia_, which had been captured by the\r\nRussians; (_c_) for having been instructed to purchase in Cape Town, or\r\nits neighbourhood, 11,000 ft. of conducting wire of good insulation;\r\n(_d_) for having navigated at the head of the squadron in the position\r\nusually occupied by reconnoitring vessels.--See Takahashi, pp. 620-625,\r\nand Higgins, _op. cit._ p. 74, and in _The Law Quarterly Review_, XXVI.\r\n(1910), p. 408.]\r\n\r\nIt must be specially observed that any man-of-war of either belligerent\r\nmay, according to article 12, demand the surrender of the wounded, sick,\r\nor shipwrecked who are on board hospital ships of any kind. According to\r\na reservation by Great Britain, article 12 is understood \"to apply only\r\nto the case of combatants rescued during or after a naval engagement in\r\nwhich they have taken part.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hospital Ships in Neutral Ports.]\r\n\r\n§ 206_a_. For the purpose of defining the status of hospital ships when\r\nentering neutral ports an International Conference met at the Hague in\r\n1904, where Germany, Austria-Hungary, Belgium, China, Korea, Denmark,\r\nSpain, the United States of America, France, Greece, Guatemala, Italy,\r\nJapan, Luxemburg, Mexico, Holland, Persia, Portugal, Roumania, Russia,\r\nServia, and Siam, were represented. Great Britain, however, did not\r\ntake part. The following is the text of the six articles of the\r\nConvention signed by all the representatives:--\r\n\r\n  Article 1.--Hospital ships fulfilling the conditions prescribed in\r\n  articles 1, 2, and 3 of the Convention concluded at the Hague on\r\n  July 27, 1899, for the adaptation of the principles of the Geneva\r\n  Convention of August 22, 1864, to naval warfare shall in time of\r\n  war be exempt in the ports of the contracting parties from all\r\n  dues and taxes imposed on vessels for the benefit of the State.\r\n\r\n  Article 2.--The provision contained in the preceding article shall\r\n  not prevent the exercise of the right of search and other\r\n  formalities demanded by the fiscal and other laws in force in the\r\n  said ports.\r\n\r\n  Article 3.--The regulation laid down in article 1 is binding only\r\n  upon the contracting Powers in case of war between two or more of\r\n  themselves. The said rule shall cease to be obligatory as soon as\r\n  in a war between any of the contracting Powers a non-contracting\r\n  Power shall join one of the belligerents.\r\n\r\n  Article 4.--The present Convention, which bears date of this day\r\n  and may be signed up to October 1, 1905, by any Power which shall\r\n  have expressed a wish to do so, shall be ratified as speedily as\r\n  possible. The ratifications shall be deposited at the Hague. On\r\n  the deposit of the ratifications, a _procès-verbal_ shall be drawn\r\n  up, of which a certified copy shall be conveyed by diplomatic\r\n  channels, after the deposit of each ratification, to all the\r\n  contracting Powers.\r\n\r\n  Article 5.--Non-signatory Powers will be allowed to adhere to the\r\n  present convention after October 1, 1905. For that purpose they\r\n  will have to make known the fact of their adhesion to the\r\n  contracting Powers by means of a written notification addressed to\r\n  the Government of the Netherlands, which will be communicated by\r\n  that Government to all the other contracting Powers.\r\n\r\n  Article 6.--In the event of any of the high contracting parties\r\n  denouncing the present Convention, the denunciation shall only\r\n  take effect after notification has been made in writing to the\r\n  Government of the Netherlands and communicated by that Government\r\n  at once to all the other contracting Powers. Such denunciation\r\n  shall be effective only in respect of the Power which shall have\r\n  given notice of it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sick-Bays.]\r\n\r\n§ 206_b_. According to article 7, in case of a fight on board a\r\nman-of-war, the sick-bays must, as far as possible, be respected and\r\nspared. These sick-bays, and the material belonging to them, remain\r\nsubject to the laws of war; they may not, however, be used for any\r\npurpose other than that for which they were originally intended so long\r\nas they are required for the wounded and sick. But should the military\r\nsituation require it, a commander into whose power they have fallen may\r\nnevertheless apply them to other purposes, under the condition that he\r\npreviously makes arrangements for proper accommodation for the wounded\r\nand sick on board. The protection to which sick-bays are entitled ceases\r\nif they are made use of to commit acts harmful to the enemy (article 8).\r\nBut the fact that the staff of sick-bays is armed in order to defend the\r\nwounded and sick is not sufficient reason for withdrawing protection.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Distinctive Colour and Emblem of Hospital Ships.]\r\n\r\n§ 207. All military hospital ships must be painted white outside with a\r\nhorizontal band of green about one metre and a half in breadth. Other\r\nhospital ships must also be painted white outside, but with a horizontal\r\nband of red. The boats and small craft of hospital ships used for\r\nhospital work must likewise be painted white. And besides being painted\r\nin this distinguishing colour, all military and other hospital ships\r\n(article 5) must hoist, together with their national flag, the white\r\nflag with a red cross stipulated by the Geneva Convention. If they\r\nbelong to a neutral State, they must also fly at the main mast the\r\nnational flag of the belligerent under whose control they are placed.\r\nHospital ships which, under the terms of article 4, are detained by the\r\nenemy, must haul down the national flag of the belligerent to whom they\r\nbelong. All hospital ships which wish to ensure by night the freedom\r\nfrom interference to which they are entitled, must, subject to the\r\nassent of the belligerent they are accompanying, take the necessary\r\nmeasures to render their special painting sufficiently plain. According\r\nto article 6 the distinguishing signs mentioned in article 5 may only be\r\nused, whether in time of peace or war, for protecting or indicating the\r\nships therein mentioned.\r\n\r\nAlthough in this connection the red cross is especially stipulated as\r\nthe distinctive emblem, there is no objection to the use by\r\nnon-Christian States, who object to the cross on religious grounds, of\r\nanother emblem. Thus Turkey reserved the right to use a red crescent,\r\nand Persia to use a red sun.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Neutral Vessels assisting the Wounded, Sick, or Shipwrecked.]\r\n\r\n§ 208. A distinction must be made between neutral men-of-war and private\r\nvessels assisting the sick, wounded, and shipwrecked.\r\n\r\n(1) If men-of-war take on board wounded, sick, or shipwrecked persons,\r\nprecaution must be taken, so far as possible, that they do not again\r\ntake part in the operations of war (article 13). Such individuals must\r\nnot, however, be handed over to the adversary but must be detained till\r\nthe end of the war.[416]\r\n\r\n(2) Neutral merchantmen,[417] yachts, or boats which have of their own\r\naccord rescued sick, wounded, or shipwrecked men, or who have taken such\r\nmen on board at the appeal of the belligerent, must, according to\r\narticle 9, enjoy special protection and certain immunities. In no case\r\nmay they be captured for the sole reason of having such persons on\r\nboard. But, subject to any undertaking that may have been given to them,\r\nthey remain liable to capture for any violation of neutrality they may\r\nhave committed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 416: See below, § 348.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 417: See below, § 348_a_.]\r\n\r\nIt must be specially observed that, according to article 12, any\r\nman-of-war of either belligerent may demand from merchant ships, yachts,\r\nand boats, whatever the nationality of such vessels, the surrender of\r\nthe wounded, sick, or shipwrecked who are on board.\r\n\r\nAccording to the reservation of Great Britain, mentioned above in §\r\n206, article 12 is understood \"to apply only to the case of combatants\r\nrescued during or after a naval engagement in which they have taken\r\npart.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Religious, Medical, and Hospital Staff.]\r\n\r\n§ 209. The religious, medical, and hospital staff of any captured vessel\r\nis inviolable, and the members may not be made prisoners of war, but\r\nthey must continue to discharge their duties while necessary. If they do\r\nthis, the belligerent into whose hands they have fallen has to give them\r\nthe same allowances and the same pay as are granted to persons holding\r\nthe same rank in his own navy. They may leave the ship, when the\r\ncommander-in-chief considers it possible, and on leaving they are\r\nallowed to take with them all surgical articles and instruments which\r\nare their private property (article 10).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Application of Convention X., and Prevention of Abuses.]\r\n\r\n§ 209_a_. The provisions of Convention X. are only binding in the case\r\nof war between contracting Powers, they cease to be binding the moment a\r\nnon-contracting Power becomes one of the belligerents (article 18). In\r\nthe case of operations of war between land and sea forces of\r\nbelligerents, the provisions of Convention X. only apply to forces on\r\nboard ship (article 22). The commanders-in-chief of the belligerent\r\nfleets must, in accordance with the instructions of their Governments\r\nand in conformity with the general principles of the Convention, arrange\r\nthe details for carrying out the articles of Convention X., as well as\r\nfor cases not provided for in these articles (article 19). The\r\ncontracting parties must take the necessary measures to instruct their\r\nnaval forces, especially the personnel protected by Convention X., in\r\nthe provisions of the Convention, and to bring these provisions to the\r\nnotice of the public (article 20). The contracting Powers must, in case\r\ntheir criminal laws are inadequate, enact measures necessary for\r\nchecking, in time of war, individual acts of pillage or maltreatment of\r\nthe wounded and sick in the fleet, as well as for punishing, as\r\nunjustifiable adoption of military or naval marks, the unauthorised use\r\nof the distinctive signs mentioned in article 5 on the part of vessels\r\nnot protected by the present Convention; they must communicate to each\r\nother, through the Dutch Government, the enactments for preventing such\r\nacts at the latest within five years of the ratification of Convention\r\nX.[418] (article 21).\r\n\r\n[Footnote 418: Great Britain has entered a reservation against articles\r\n6 and 21, but see above, § 124_b_, p. 164, note 1.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General Provisions of Convention X.]\r\n\r\n§ 209_b_. Convention X. comes into force sixty days after ratification\r\nor accession on the part of each Power concerned (article 26). It\r\nreplaces the Convention of 1899 for the adaptation to naval warfare of\r\nthe principles of the Geneva Convention, but this latter Convention\r\nremains in force between such of its contracting parties as do not\r\nbecome parties to Convention X. (article 25). Such non-signatory Powers\r\nof Convention X. as are parties to the Geneva Convention of 1906 are\r\nfree to accede at any time, and a Power desiring to accede must notify\r\nits intention in writing to the Dutch Government which must communicate\r\nthe accession to all the contracting Powers (article 24). Each of the\r\ncontracting Powers is at any time at liberty to denounce Convention X.\r\nby a written notification to the Dutch Government which must immediately\r\ncommunicate the notification to all the other contracting Powers; the\r\ndenunciation, however, does not take effect until one year after the\r\nnotification has reached the Dutch Government, and a denunciation only\r\naffects the Power making the notification (article 27). A register kept\r\nby the Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs must record the dates of the\r\ndeposit of ratifications, as well as the dates of accessions or of\r\ndenunciations; each contracting Power is entitled to have access to\r\nthis register and to be supplied with duly certified extracts from it\r\n(article 28).\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nESPIONAGE, TREASON, RUSES\r\n\r\n  See, besides the literature quoted above at the commencement of §§\r\n  159 and 163, Pradier-Fodéré, VIII. No. 3157, and Bentwich in _The\r\n  Journal of the Society of Comparative Legislation_, New Series, X.\r\n  (1909), pp. 243-249.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Espionage and Treason.]\r\n\r\n§ 210. Espionage[419] and treason do not play as large a part in sea\r\nwarfare as in land warfare;[420] still they may be made use of by\r\nbelligerents. But it must be specially observed that, since the Hague\r\nRegulations deal only with land warfare, the legal necessity of trying a\r\nspy by court-martial according to article 30 of these Regulations does\r\nnot exist for sea warfare, although such trial by court-martial is\r\nadvisable.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 419: As regards the case of the _Haimun_, see below, § 356.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 420: See above, §§ 159-162.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ruses.]\r\n\r\n§ 211. Ruses are customarily allowed in sea warfare within the same\r\nlimits as in land warfare, perfidy being excluded. As regards the use of\r\na false flag, it is by most publicists considered perfectly lawful for a\r\nman-of-war to use a neutral's or the enemy's flag (1) when chasing an\r\nenemy vessel, (2) when trying to escape, and (3) for the purpose of\r\ndrawing an enemy vessel into action.[421] On the other hand, it is\r\nuniversally agreed that immediately before an attack a vessel must fly\r\nher national flag. Halleck (I. p. 568) relates the following instance:\r\nIn 1783 the _Sybille_, a French frigate of thirty-eight guns, enticed\r\nthe British man-of-war _Hussar_ by displaying the British flag and\r\nintimating herself to be a distressed prize of a British captor. The\r\n_Hussar_ approached to succour her, but the latter at once attacked the\r\n_Hussar_ without showing the French flag. She was, however, overpowered\r\nand captured, and the commander of the _Hussar_ publicly broke the sword\r\nof the commander of the _Sybille_, whom he justly accused of perfidy,\r\nalthough the French commander was acquitted when subsequently brought to\r\ntrial by the French Government. Again, Halleck (I. p. 568) relates: In\r\n1813 two merchants of New York carried out a plan for destroying the\r\nBritish man-of-war _Ramillies_ in the following way. A schooner with\r\nsome casks of flour on deck was expressly laden with several casks of\r\ngunpowder having trains leading from a species of gunlock, which, by the\r\naction of clockwork, went off at a given time after it had been set. To\r\nentice the _Ramillies_ to seize her, the schooner came up, and the\r\n_Ramillies_ then sent a boat with thirteen men and a lieutenant to cut\r\nher off. Subsequently the crew of the schooner abandoned her and she\r\nblew up with the lieutenant and his men on board.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 421: The use of a false flag on the part of a belligerent\r\nman-of-war is analogous to the use of the enemy flag and the like in\r\nland warfare; see above, § 164. British practice--see Holland, _Prize\r\nLaw_, § 200--permits the use of false colours. U.S. Naval War Code,\r\narticle 7, forbids it altogether, whereas as late as 1898, during the\r\nwar with Spain in consequence of the Cuban insurrection, two American\r\nmen-of-war made use of the Spanish flag (see Perels, p. 183). And during\r\nthe war between Turkey and Russia, in 1877, Russian men-of-war in the\r\nBlack Sea made use of the Italian flag (see Martens, II. § 103, p. 566).\r\nThe question of the permissibility of the use of a neutral or enemy flag\r\nis answered in the affirmative, among others, by Ortolan, II. p. 29;\r\nFiore, III. No. 1340; Perels, § 35, p. 183; Pillet, p. 116; Bonfils, No.\r\n1274; Calvo, IV. 2106; Hall, § 187. See also Pillet in _R.G._ V. (1898),\r\npp. 444-451. But see the arguments against the use of a false flag in\r\nPradier-Fodéré, VI. No. 2760.]\r\n\r\nVattel (III. § 178) relates the following case of perfidy: In 1755,\r\nduring war between Great Britain and France, a British man-of-war\r\nappeared off Calais, made signals of distress for the purpose of\r\nsoliciting French vessels to approach to her succour, and seized a sloop\r\nand some sailors who came to bring her help. Vattel is himself not\r\ncertain whether this case is a fact or fiction. But be that as it may,\r\nthere is no doubt that, if the case be true, it is an example of\r\nperfidy, which is not allowed.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nREQUISITIONS, CONTRIBUTIONS, BOMBARDMENT\r\n\r\n  Hall, § 140*--Lawrence, § 204--Westlake, II. pp. 315-318--Moore,\r\n  VII. §§ 1166-1174--Taylor, § 499--Bonfils, Nos.\r\n  1277-1277'1--Despagnet, Nos. 618-618 _bis_--Fiore, Code, Nos.\r\n  1633-1642--Pradier-Fodéré, VIII.

No case has to my knowledge occurred in Europe[422] of\r\nrequisitions or contributions imposed by naval forces upon enemy coast\r\ntowns. The question whether or not such requisitions and contributions\r\nwould be lawful became of interest through an article on naval warfare\r\nof the future, published in 1882 by the French Admiral Aube in the\r\n_Revue des Deux Mondes_ (vol. 50, p. 331). Aube pointed out that one of\r\nthe tasks of the fleet in sea warfare of the future would be to attack\r\nand destroy by bombardment fortified and unfortified military and\r\ncommercial enemy coast towns, or at least to compel them mercilessly to\r\nrequisitions and contributions. As during the British naval manoeuvres\r\nof 1888 and 1889 imaginary contributions were imposed upon several coast\r\ntowns, Hall (§ 140*) took into consideration the question under what\r\nconditions requisitions and contributions would be lawful in sea\r\nwarfare. He concluded, after careful consideration and starting from the\r\nprinciples regarding requisitions and contributions in land warfare,\r\nthat such requisitions and contributions may be levied, provided a force\r\nis landed which actually takes possession of the respective coast town\r\nand establishes itself there, although only temporarily, until the\r\nimposed requisitions and contributions have been complied with; that,\r\nhowever, no requisitions or contributions could be demanded by a single\r\nmessage sent on shore under threatened penalty of bombardment in case of\r\nrefusal. There is no doubt that Hall's arguments are, logically,\r\ncorrect; but it was not at all certain that the naval Powers would adopt\r\nthem, since neither the Institute of International Law nor the U.S.\r\nNaval War Code had done so.[423] The Second Hague Peace Conference has\r\nnow settled the matter through the Convention (IX.) concerning\r\nbombardment by naval forces in time of war which amongst its thirteen\r\narticles includes two--3 and 4--dealing with requisitions and\r\ncontributions. This Convention has been signed, although with some\r\nreservations, by all the Powers represented at the Conference except\r\nSpain, China, and Nicaragua, but China and Nicaragua acceded later. Many\r\nStates have already ratified.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 422: Holland, _Studies_, p. 101, mentions a case which\r\noccurred in South America in 1871.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 423: The Institute of International Law has touched upon the\r\nquestion of requisitions and contributions in sea warfare in article 4,\r\nNo. 1, of its rules regarding the bombardment of open towns by naval\r\nforces; see below, § 213, p. 267. U.S. Naval War Code, article 4, allows\r\n\"reasonable\" requisitions, but no contributions since \"ransom\" is not\r\nallowed.]\r\n\r\nAccording to article 3 undefended ports, towns, villages, dwellings, or\r\nother buildings may be bombarded by a naval force, if the local\r\nauthorities, on a formal summons being made to them, decline to comply\r\nwith requisitions for provisions or supplies _necessary_ for the\r\n_immediate_ use of the naval force concerned. These requisitions must be\r\nproportional to the resources of the place; they can only be demanded by\r\nthe commander of the naval force concerned; they must be paid for in\r\ncash, and, if this is not possible for want of sufficient ready money,\r\ntheir receipt must be acknowledged.\r\n\r\nAs regards contributions, Convention IX. does not directly forbid the\r\ndemand for them, but article 4 expressly forbids bombardment of\r\nundefended places by a naval force on account of non-payment of money\r\ncontributions; in practice, therefore, the demand for contributions will\r\nnot occur in naval warfare.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bombardment of the Enemy Coast.]\r\n\r\n§ 213. There is no doubt whatever that enemy coast towns which are\r\ndefended may be bombarded by naval forces, acting either independently\r\nor in co-operation with a besieging army. But before the Second Peace\r\nConference of 1907 the question was not settled as to whether or not\r\n_open and undefended_ coast places might be bombarded by naval forces.\r\nThe Institute of International Law in 1895, at its meeting at Cambridge,\r\nappointed a committee to investigate the matter. The report[424] of this\r\ncommittee, drafted by Professor Holland with the approval of the Dutch\r\nGeneral Den Beer Portugael, and presented in 1896 at the meeting at\r\nVenice,[425] is of such interest that it is advisable to reproduce here\r\na translation of the following chief parts:--\r\n\r\n  When the Prince de Joinville recommended in 1844, in case of war,\r\n  the devastation of the great commercial towns of England, the Duke\r\n  of Wellington wrote:--\"What but the inordinate desire of\r\n  popularity could have induced a man in his station to write and\r\n  publish such a production, an invitation and provocation to war,\r\n  to be carried on in a manner such as has been disclaimed by the\r\n  civilised portions of mankind?\" (Raikes, _Correspondence_, p.\r\n  367). The opinion of the Prince de Joinville has been taken up by\r\n  Admiral Aube in an article which appeared in the _Revue des Deux\r\n  Mondes_ in 1882. After having remarked that the ultimate object of\r\n  war is to inflict the greatest possible damage to the enemy and\r\n  that \"La richesse est le nerf de la guerre,\" he goes on as\r\n  follows:--\"Tout ce qui frappe l'ennemi dans sa richesse devient\r\n  non seulement légitime, mais s'impose comme obligatoire. Il faut\r\n  donc s'attendre à voir les flottes cuirassées, maîtresses de la\r\n  mer, tourner leur puissance d'attaque et déstruction, à défaut\r\n  d'adversaires se dérobant à leurs coups, contre toutes les villes\r\n  du littoral, fortifiées ou non, pacifiques ou guerrières, les\r\n  incendier, les ruiner, et tout au moins les rançonner sans merci.\r\n  Cela s'est fait autrefois; cela ne se fait plus; cela se fera\r\n  encore: Strasbourg et Péronne en sont garants....\"\r\n\r\n  The discussion was opened again in 1888, on the occasion of\r\n  manoeuvres executed by the British Fleet, the enemy part of which\r\n  feigned to hold to ransom, under the threat of bombardment, great\r\n  commercial towns, such as Liverpool, and to cause unnecessary\r\n  devastation to pleasure towns and bathing-places, such as\r\n  Folkestone, through throwing bombs. One of your reporters observed\r\n  in a series of letters addressed to the _Times_ that such acts are\r\n  contrary to the rules of International Law as well as to the\r\n  practice of the present century. He maintained that bombardment of\r\n  an open town ought to be allowed only for the purpose of obtaining\r\n  requisitions in kind necessary for the enemy fleet and\r\n  contributions instead of requisitions, further by the way of\r\n  reprisal, and in case the town defends itself against occupation\r\n  by enemy troops approaching on land.... Most of the admirals and\r\n  naval officers of England who took part in the lively\r\n  correspondence which arose in the _Times_ and other journals\r\n  during the months of August and September 1880 took up a contrary\r\n  attitude....\r\n\r\n[Footnote 424: See _Annuaire_, XV. (1896), pp. 148-150.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 425: See _Annuaire_, XV. (1896), p. 313.]\r\n\r\nOn the basis of this report the Institute, at the same meeting, adopted\r\na body of rules regarding the bombardment of open towns by naval forces,\r\ndeclaring that the rules of the law of war concerning bombardment are\r\nthe same in the case of land warfare and sea warfare. Of special\r\ninterest are articles 4 and 5 of these rules, which run as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Article 4. In virtue of the general principles above, the\r\n  bombardment by a naval force of an open town, that is to say one\r\n  which is not defended by fortifications or by other means of\r\n  attack or of resistance for immediate defence, or by detached\r\n  forts situated in proximity, for example of the maximum distance\r\n  of from four to ten kilometres, is inadmissible except in the\r\n  following cases:--\r\n\r\n  (1) For the purpose of obtaining by requisitions or contributions\r\n  what is necessary for the fleet. These requisitions or\r\n  contributions must in every case remain within the limits\r\n  prescribed by articles 56 and 58 of the Manual of the Institute.\r\n\r\n  (2) For the purpose of destroying sheds, military erections,\r\n  depôts of war munitions, or of war vessels in a port. Further, an\r\n  open town which defends itself against the entrance of troops or\r\n  of disembarked marines can be bombarded for the purpose of\r\n  protecting the disembarkation of the soldiers and of the marines,\r\n  if the open town attempts to prevent it, and as an auxiliary\r\n  measure of war to facilitate the result made by the troops and the\r\n  disembarked marines, if the town defends itself. Bombardments of\r\n  which the object is only to exact a ransom are specially\r\n  forbidden, and, with the stronger reason, those which are intended\r\n  only to bring about the submission of the country by the\r\n  destruction, for which there is no other motive, of the peaceful\r\n  inhabitants or of their property.\r\n\r\n  Article 5. An open town cannot be exposed to a bombardment for the\r\n  only reasons:--\r\n\r\n  (_a_) That it is the capital of the State or the seat of the\r\n  Government (but naturally these circumstances do not guarantee it\r\n  in any way against a bombardment).\r\n\r\n  (_b_) That it is actually occupied by troops, or that it is\r\n  ordinarily the garrison of troops of different arms intended to\r\n  join the army in time of war.\r\n\r\nThe First Peace Conference did not settle the matter, but expressed the\r\ndesire \"that the proposal to settle the question of bombardment of\r\nports, towns, and villages by a naval force may be referred to a\r\nsubsequent Conference for consideration.\" The Second Peace Conference,\r\nhowever, by Convention IX.--see above, § 212, p. 265--has provided\r\ndetailed rules concerning all the points in question, and the following\r\nis now the law concerning bombardment by naval forces:--\r\n\r\n(1) The bombardment of undefended ports, towns, villages, dwellings, or\r\nother buildings is under all circumstances and conditions prohibited\r\n(article 1). To define the term \"undefended,\" article 1 expressly enacts\r\nthat \"a place cannot be bombarded solely because automatic submarine\r\ncontact mines are anchored off the harbour,\" but Great Britain, France,\r\nGermany, and Japan entered a reservation against this, since they\r\ncorrectly consider such a place to be \"defended.\"\r\n\r\n(2) Although undefended places themselves are exempt, nevertheless\r\nmilitary works, military or naval establishments, depôts of arms or war\r\nmaterial, workshops or plant which could be utilised for the needs of\r\nthe hostile fleet or army, and men-of-war in the harbour of undefended\r\nplaces may be bombarded. And no responsibility is incurred for any\r\nunavoidable damage caused thereby to the undefended place or its\r\ninhabitants. As a rule, however, the commander must, before resorting to\r\nbombardment of these works, ships, and the like, give warning to the\r\nlocal authorities so that they can destroy the works and vessels\r\nthemselves. Only if, for military reasons, immediate action is necessary\r\nand no delay can be allowed to the enemy, may bombardment be resorted to\r\nwithout previous warning, the commander being compelled to take all due\r\nmeasures in order that the undefended place itself may suffer as little\r\nharm as possible (article 2).\r\n\r\nThe first case in which naval forces acted according to these rules\r\noccurred during the Turco-Italian war. On February 25, 1912, Admiral\r\nFaravelli, the commander of an Italian squadron, surprised, at dawn, the\r\nTurkish gunboat _Awni-Illa_ and a torpedo-boat in the port of Beirut.\r\nThese vessels were called upon to surrender, they were given until nine\r\no'clock a.m. to comply with the demand, and the demand was communicated\r\nto the Governor and the Consular authorities. At nine o'clock the\r\nTurkish vessels were again, by signal, summoned to surrender, and as no\r\nreply was received, they were fired at and destroyed, but not without\r\nfirst having vigorously answered the fire of the Italians. Shells\r\nmissing the vessels and bursting on the quay killed and wounded a number\r\nof individuals and damaged several buildings. The Turkish Government\r\nprotested against this procedure as a violation of Convention IX. of the\r\nSecond Peace Conference, but, provided the official report of Admiral\r\nFaravelli corresponds with the facts, the Turkish protest is unfounded.\r\n\r\n(3) In case undefended places do not comply with legitimate\r\nrequisitions, they likewise may be bombarded; see details above, § 212.\r\n\r\n(4) In case of bombardments, all necessary steps must be taken to spare\r\nbuildings devoted to public worship, art, science, or charitable\r\npurposes; historical monuments; hospitals, and places where the sick or\r\nwounded are collected, provided they are not at the time used for\r\nmilitary purposes. To enable the attacking force to carry out this\r\ninjunction, the privileged buildings, monuments, and places must be\r\nindicated by visible signs, which shall consist of large stiff\r\nrectangular panels, divided diagonally into two coloured triangular\r\nportions, the upper portion black, the lower portion white (article 5).\r\nUnless military exigencies render it impossible the commander of an\r\nattacking naval force must, before commencing the bombardment, do all in\r\nhis power to warn the authorities (article 6).\r\n\r\n(5) The giving over to pillage of a town or place, even when taken by\r\nassault, is forbidden (article 7).\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nINTERFERENCE WITH SUBMARINE TELEGRAPH CABLES\r\n\r\n  Moore, VII. § 1176--Westlake, II. pp. 280-283--Liszt, § 41,\r\n  III.--Bonfils, No. 1278--Pradier-Fodéré, VI.

As the \"International Convention[426] for the Protection of\r\nSubmarine Telegraph Cables\" of 1884 expressly stipulates by article 15\r\nthat freedom of action is reserved to belligerents, the question is not\r\nsettled how far belligerents are entitled to interfere with submarine\r\ntelegraph cables. The only conventional rule concerning this question is\r\narticle 54 of the Hague Regulations, inserted by the Second Peace\r\nConference, which enacts that submarine cables connecting occupied enemy\r\nterritory with a neutral territory shall not be seized or destroyed, and\r\nthat, if a case of absolute necessity has compelled the occupant to\r\nseize or destroy such cable, it must be restored after the conclusion of\r\npeace and indemnities paid. There is no rule in existence which deals\r\nwith other possible cases of seizure and destruction.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 426: See above, vol. I. §§ 286 and 287.]\r\n\r\nThe Institute of International Law has studied the matter and\r\nadopted,[427] at its meeting at Brussels in 1902, the following five\r\nrules:--\r\n\r\n  (1) Le câble sousmarin reliant deux territoires neutres est\r\n  inviolable.\r\n\r\n  (2) Le câble reliant les territoires de deux belligérants ou deux\r\n  parties du territoire d'un des belligérants peut être coupé\r\n  partout, excepté dans la mer territoriale et dans les eaux\r\n  neutralisées dépendant d'un territoire neutre.\r\n\r\n  (3) Le câble reliant un territoire neutre au territoire d'un des\r\n  belligérants ne peut en aucun cas être coupé dans la mer\r\n  territoriale ou dans les eaux neutralisées dépendant d'un\r\n  territoire neutre. En haute mer, ce câble ne peut être coupé que\r\n  s'il y a blocus effectif et dans les limites de la ligne du\r\n  blocus, sauf rétablissement du câble dans le plus bref délai\r\n  possible. Le câble peut toujours être coupé sur le territoire et\r\n  dans la mer territoriale dépendant d'un territoire ennemi jusqu'à\r\n  d'une distance de trois milles marins de la laisse de basse-marée.\r\n\r\n  (4) Il est entendu que la liberté de l'État neutre de transmettre\r\n  des dépêches n'implique pas la faculté d'en user ou d'en permettre\r\n  l'usage manifestement pour prêter assistance à l'un des\r\n  belligérants.\r\n\r\n  (5) En ce qui concerne l'application des règles précédentes, il\r\n  n'y a de différence à établir ni entre les câbles d'État et les\r\n  câbles appartenant à des particuliers, ni entre les câbles de\r\n  propriété ennemie et ceux qui sont de propriété neutre.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 427: See _Annuaire_, XIX. (1902), p. 331.]\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Naval War Code, article 5, laid down the following rules:--\r\n\r\n  (1) Submarine telegraphic cables between points in the territory\r\n  of an enemy, or between the territory of the United States and\r\n  that of an enemy, are subject to such treatment as the necessities\r\n  of war may require.\r\n\r\n  (2) Submarine telegraphic cables between the territory of an enemy\r\n  and neutral territory may be interrupted within the territorial\r\n  jurisdiction of the enemy.\r\n\r\n  (3) Submarine telegraphic cables between two neutral territories\r\n  shall be held inviolable and free from interruption.[428]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 428: It is impossible for a treatise to discuss the details of\r\nthe absolutely unsettled question as to how far belligerents may\r\ninterfere with submarine telegraph cables.

Although the outbreak of war between States as a rule brings\r\nnon-hostile intercourse to an end, necessity of circumstances,\r\nconvenience, humanity, and other factors call, or may call, some kinds\r\nof non-hostile relations of belligerents into existence. And it is a\r\nuniversally recognised principle of International Law that, where such\r\nrelations arise, belligerents must carry them out in good faith. _Fides\r\netiam hosti servanda_ is a rule which was adhered to in antiquity, when\r\nno International Law in the modern sense of the term existed. But it had\r\nthen a religious and moral sanction only. Since in modern times war is\r\nnot a condition of anarchy and lawlessness between belligerents, but a\r\ncontention in many respects regulated, restricted, and modified by law,\r\nit is obvious that, where non-hostile relations between belligerents\r\noccur, they are protected by law. _Fides etiam hosti servanda_ is,\r\ntherefore, a principle which nowadays enjoys as well a legal as a\r\nreligious and moral sanction.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Different kinds of Non-hostile Relations.]\r\n\r\n§ 216. As through the outbreak of war all diplomatic intercourse and\r\nother non-hostile relations come to an end, it is obvious that\r\nnon-hostile relations between belligerents must originate either from\r\nspecial rules of International Law or from special agreements between\r\nthe belligerents.\r\n\r\nNo special rules of International Law which demanded non-hostile\r\nrelations between belligerents existed in former times, but of late a\r\nfew rules of this kind have arisen. Thus, for instance, release on\r\nparole[429] of prisoners of war creates an obligation on the part of the\r\nenemy not to re-admit the individuals concerned into the forces while\r\nthe war lasts. And, to give another example, by article 4 of the Geneva\r\nConvention of 1906, and article 14 of the Hague Regulations--see also\r\narticle 17 of Convention X. of the Second Peace Conference--it is the\r\nduty of either belligerent to return to the enemy, by his\r\nprisoner-of-war bureau, all objects of personal use, letters, jewellery,\r\nand the like found on the battlefield or left by those who died in\r\nhospital.[430] Non-hostile relations of this kind, however, need not be\r\nconsidered in this chapter, since they have already been discussed on\r\nseveral previous pages.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 429: See above, § 129.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 430: See above, § 144.]\r\n\r\nNon-hostile relations originating from special agreements of\r\nbelligerents, so-called _commercia belli_, may either be concluded in\r\ntime of peace for the purpose of creating certain non-hostile relations\r\nbetween the parties in case war breaks out, or they may be concluded\r\nduring the actual time of war. Such non-hostile relations are created\r\nthrough passports, safe-conducts, safeguards, flags of truce, cartels,\r\ncapitulations, and armistices. Non-hostile relations can also be\r\ncreated by peace negotiations.[431] Each of these non-hostile relations\r\nmust be discussed separately.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 431: See below, § 267.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Licences to Trade.]\r\n\r\n§ 217. Several writers[432] speak of non-hostile relations between\r\nbelligerents created by licences to trade granted by a belligerent to\r\nenemy subjects either within certain limits or generally. It has been\r\nexplained above, in § 101, that it is for Municipal Law to determine\r\nwhether or not through the outbreak of war all trade and the like is\r\nprohibited between the subjects of belligerents. If the Municipal Law of\r\none or both belligerents does contain such a prohibition, it is of\r\ncourse within the discretion of one or both of them to grant exceptional\r\nlicences to trade to their own or the other belligerent's subjects, and\r\nsuch licences naturally include certain privileges. Thus, for instance,\r\nif a belligerent allows enemy subjects to trade with his own subjects,\r\nenemy merchantmen engaged in such trade are exempt from capture and\r\nappropriation by the grantor. Yet it is not International Law which\r\ncreates this exemption, but the very licence to trade granted by the\r\nbelligerent and revocable at any moment; and no non-hostile\r\ninternational relations between the belligerents themselves originate\r\nfrom such licences. The matter would be different if, either in time of\r\npeace for the time of war, or, during war, the belligerents agreed to\r\nallow certain trade between their subjects; but non-hostile relations\r\noriginating from such an agreement would not be relations arising from a\r\nlicence to trade, but from a cartel.[433]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 432: See, for instance, Hall, § 196; Halleck, II. pp. 343-363;\r\nLawrence, § 214; Manning, p. 168; Taylor, § 512; Wheaton, §§ 409-410;\r\nFiore, III.

Belligerents on occasions arrange between themselves that\r\npassports and safe-conducts shall be given to certain of each other's\r\nsubjects. Passports are written permissions given by a belligerent to\r\nenemy subjects, or others, allowing them to travel within that\r\nbelligerent's territory or enemy territory occupied by him.\r\nSafe-conducts are written permissions given by a belligerent to enemy\r\nsubjects, or others, allowing them to proceed to a particular place for\r\na defined object, for instance, to a besieged town for conducting\r\ncertain negotiations; but safe-conducts may also be given for goods, and\r\nthey then comprise permission to carry such goods without molestation to\r\na certain place. Passports as well as safe-conducts make the grantee\r\ninviolable so long and in so far as he complies with the conditions\r\nspecially imposed upon him or made necessary by the circumstances of the\r\nspecial case. Passports and safe-conducts are not transferable, and they\r\nmay be granted to enemy subjects for a limited or an unlimited period;\r\nin the former case their validity ceases with the expiration of the\r\nperiod. Both may be withdrawn, not only when the grantee abuses the\r\nprotection, but also for military expediency. It must, however, be\r\nspecially observed that passports and safe-conducts are only a matter\r\nof International Law when the granting of them has been arranged between\r\nthe belligerents or their responsible commanders, or between\r\nbelligerents and neutral Powers. If they are granted without such an\r\narrangement, unilaterally on the part of one of the belligerents, they\r\nfall outside the scope of International Law.[434]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 434: The distinction between passports and the like arranged\r\nbetween the belligerents to be granted, on the one hand, and, on the\r\nother, such as are granted unilaterally, would seem to be necessary,\r\nalthough it is not generally made.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Safeguards.]\r\n\r\n§ 219. Belligerents on occasions arrange between themselves that they\r\nshall grant protection to certain of each other's subjects or property\r\nagainst their own forces in the form of safeguards, of which there are\r\ntwo kinds. One consists in a written order given to an enemy subject or\r\nleft with enemy property and addressed to the commander of armed forces\r\nof the grantor, in which the former is charged with the protection of\r\nthe respective individual or property, and by which both become\r\ninviolable. The other kind of safeguard is given by detailing one or\r\nmore soldiers to accompany enemy subjects or to guard the spot where\r\ncertain enemy property is, for the purpose of protection. Soldiers on\r\nthis duty are inviolable on the part of the other belligerent; they must\r\nneither be attacked nor made prisoners, and they must, on falling into\r\nthe hands of the enemy, be fed, well kept, and eventually safely sent\r\nback to their corps. As in the case of passports and safe-conducts, it\r\nmust be specially observed that safeguards are only a matter of\r\nInternational Law when the granting of them has been arranged by the\r\nbelligerents, and not otherwise; except in the case of the safeguards\r\nmentioned by article 8, No. 2, of the Geneva Convention of 1906, who,\r\naccording to articles 9 and 12 of that Convention, are inviolable.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nFLAGS OF TRUCE\r\n\r\n  Hall, § 190--Lawrence, § 211--Westlake, II. p. 81--Moore, VII. §\r\n  1157--Phillimore, III. § 115--Halleck, II. pp. 333, 334--Taylor, §\r\n  510--Bluntschli, §§ 681-684--Heffter, § 126--Lueder in\r\n  Holtzendorff, IV. pp. 421-423--Ullmann, § 180--Bonfils, Nos.\r\n  1239-1245--Despagnet, Nos. 556-557--Pradier-Fodéré, VII.

Although the outbreak of war brings all negotiations between\r\nbelligerents to an end, and although no negotiations are as a rule\r\nconducted during war, certain circumstances and conditions make it\r\nnecessary or convenient for the armed forces of belligerents to enter\r\ninto negotiations with each other for various purposes. Since time\r\nimmemorial a white flag has been used as a symbol by an armed force\r\nwishing to negotiate with the enemy, and always and everywhere it has\r\nbeen considered a duty of the enemy to respect this symbol. In land\r\nwarfare the flag of truce is made use of in the following manner.[435]\r\nAn individual--soldier or civilian--charged by his force with the task\r\nof negotiating with the enemy, approaches the latter either carrying the\r\nflag himself, or accompanied by a flag-bearer and, often, also by a\r\ndrummer, a bugler, or a trumpeter, and an interpreter. In sea warfare\r\nthe individual charged with the task of negotiating approaches the enemy\r\nin a boat flying the white flag. The Hague Regulations have now by\r\narticles 32 to 34 enacted most of the customary rules of International\r\nLaw regarding flags of truce without adding any new rule. These rules\r\nare the same for land warfare as for sea warfare, although their\r\nvalidity for land warfare is now grounded on the Hague Regulations,\r\nwhereas their validity for sea warfare is still based on custom only.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 435: See Hague Regulations, article 32.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Treatment of Unadmitted Flag-bearers.]\r\n\r\n§ 221. As a commander of an armed force is not, according to article 33\r\nof the Hague Regulations, compelled to receive a bearer of a flag of\r\ntruce, a flag-bearer who makes his appearance may at once be signalled\r\nto withdraw. Yet even then he is inviolable from the time he displays\r\nthe flag to the end of the time necessary for withdrawal. During this\r\ntime he may neither be intentionally attacked nor made prisoner.\r\nHowever, an armed force in battle is not obliged to stop its military\r\noperations on account of the approach of an enemy flag-bearer who has\r\nbeen signalled to withdraw. Although the latter may not be fired upon\r\nintentionally, should he be wounded or killed accidentally, during the\r\nbattle, no responsibility or moral blame would rest upon the belligerent\r\nconcerned. In former times the commander of an armed force could inform\r\nthe enemy that, within a certain defined or indefinite period, he would\r\nunder no circumstances or conditions receive a flag-bearer; if, in spite\r\nof such notice, a flag-bearer approached, he did not enjoy any\r\nprivilege, and he could be attacked and made prisoner like any other\r\nmember of the enemy forces. But this rule is now obsolete, and its place\r\nis taken by the rule that a commander must never, except in a case of\r\nreprisals, declare beforehand, even only for a specified period, that he\r\nwill not receive a bearer of a flag of truce.[436]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 436: This becomes quite apparent from the discussion of the\r\nsubject at the First Peace Conference; see Martens, _N.R.G._ 2nd Ser.\r\nXXVI. p. 465; and _Land Warfare_, § 234.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Treatment of Admitted Flag-bearers.]\r\n\r\n§ 222. Bearers of flags of truce and their parties, when admitted by the\r\nother side, must be granted the privilege of inviolability. They may\r\nneither be attacked nor taken prisoners, and they must be allowed to\r\nreturn safely in due time to their own lines. On the other hand, the\r\nforces admitting enemy flag-bearers need not allow them to acquire\r\ninformation about the receiving forces and to carry it back to their own\r\ncorps. Flag-bearers and their parties may, therefore, be blindfolded by\r\nthe receiving forces, or be conducted by roundabout ways, or be\r\nprevented from entering into communication with individuals other than\r\nthose who confer officially with them, and they may even temporarily be\r\nprevented from returning till a certain military operation of which they\r\nhave obtained information is carried out. Article 33 of the Hague\r\nRegulations specifically enacts that a commander to whom a flag of truce\r\nis sent \"may take all steps necessary to prevent the envoy taking\r\nadvantage of his mission to obtain information.\" Bearers of flags of\r\ntruce are not, however, prevented from reporting to their corps any\r\ninformation they have gained by observation in passing through the enemy\r\nlines and in communicating with enemy individuals. But they are not\r\nallowed to sketch maps of defences and positions, to gather information\r\nsecretly and surreptitiously, to provoke or to commit treacherous acts,\r\nand the like. If nevertheless they do any of these acts, they may be\r\ncourt-martialed. Articles 33 and 34 of the Hague Regulations\r\nspecifically enact that a flag-bearer may temporarily be detained in\r\ncase he abuses his mission for the purpose of obtaining information, and\r\nthat he loses all privileges of inviolability \"if it is proved beyond\r\ndoubt that he has taken advantage of his privileged position to provoke\r\nor commit an act of treachery.\" Bearers of white flags and their party,\r\nwho approach the enemy and are received, must carry[437] some\r\nauthorisation with them to show that they are charged with the task of\r\nentering into negotiations (article 32), otherwise they may be detained\r\nas prisoners, since it is his mission and not the white flag itself\r\nwhich protects the flag-bearer. This mission protects every one who is\r\ncharged with it, notwithstanding his position in his corps and his\r\nstatus as a civilian or a soldier, but it does not protect a deserter.\r\nThe latter may be detained, court-martialed, and punished, notice being\r\ngiven to his principal of the reason of punishment.[438]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 437: Article 32 of the Hague Regulations confirms this\r\ncustomary rule by speaking of an individual who is \"authorised\" by one\r\nof the belligerents to enter into communication with the other.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 438: See Hall, § 190.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Abuse of Flag of Truce.]\r\n\r\n§ 223. Abuse of his mission by an authorised flag-bearer must be\r\ndistinguished from an abuse of the flag of truce itself. Such abuse is\r\npossible in two different forms:--\r\n\r\n(1) The force which sends an authorised flag-bearer to the enemy has to\r\ntake up a corresponding attitude; the ranks which the flag-bearer leaves\r\nbeing obliged to halt and to cease fire. Now it constitutes an abuse of\r\nthe flag of truce if such attitude corresponding with the sending of a\r\nflag of truce is intentionally not taken up by the sending force. The\r\ncase is even worse when a flag-bearer is intentionally sent on a feigned\r\nmission in order that military operations may be carried out by the\r\nsender under the protection due from the enemy to the flag-bearer and\r\nhis party.\r\n\r\n(2) The second form of a possible abuse appears in the case in which a\r\nwhite flag is made use of for the purpose of making the enemy believe\r\nthat a flag of truce is about to be sent, although it is not sent, and\r\nof carrying out operations under the protection granted by the enemy to\r\nthis pretended flag of truce.\r\n\r\nIt need hardly be specially mentioned that both forms of abuse are gross\r\nperfidy and may be met with reprisals, or with punishment of the\r\noffenders in case they fall into the hands of the enemy. The following\r\ncase of abuse is related by Sir Sherston Baker in Halleck (II. p.\r\n315):--\"On July 12, 1882, while the British fleet was lying off\r\nAlexandria, in support of the authority of the Khedive of Egypt, and the\r\nrebels under Arabi Pasha were being driven to great straits, a rebel\r\nboat, carrying a white flag of truce, was observed approaching H.M.S.\r\n_Invincible_ from the harbour, whereupon H.M. ships _Temeraire_ and\r\n_Inflexible_, which had just commenced firing, were ordered to suspend\r\nfire. So soon as the firing ceased, the boat, instead of going to the\r\n_Invincible_, returned to the harbour. A flag of truce was\r\nsimultaneously hoisted by the rebels on the Ras-el-Tin fort. These\r\ndeceits gave the rebels time to leave the works and to retire through\r\nthe town, abandoning the forts, and withdrawing the whole of their\r\ngarrison under the flag of truce.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nCARTELS\r\n\r\n  Grotius, III. c. 21, §§ 23-30--Vattel, III. §§ 278-286--Hall, §\r\n  193--Lawrence, § 212--Westlake, II. p. 139--Phillimore, III. §§\r\n  111-112--Halleck, II. pp. 326-329--Taylor, § 599--Bluntschli, §§\r\n  679-680--Heffter, § 142--Lueder in Holtzendorff, IV. pp.\r\n  525-529--Ullmann, § 185--Bonfils, Nos. 827 and 1280--Despagnet,\r\n  No. 658--Pradier-Fodéré, VII.

Cartels are conventions between belligerents concluded for the\r\npurpose of permitting certain kinds of non-hostile intercourse between\r\none another such as would otherwise be prevented by the condition of\r\nwar. Cartels may be concluded during peace in anticipation of war, or\r\nduring the time of war, and they may provide for numerous purposes.\r\nThus, communication by post, telegraph, telephone, and railway, which\r\nwould otherwise not take place, can be arranged by cartels, as can also\r\nthe exchange of prisoners, or a certain treatment of wounded, and the\r\nlike. Thus, further, intercourse between each other's subjects through\r\ntrade[439] can, either with or without limits, be agreed upon by\r\nbelligerents. All rights and duties originating from cartels must be\r\ncomplied with in the same manner and good faith as rights and duties\r\narising from other treaties.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 439: See above, § 217. But arrangements for granting\r\npassports, safe-conducts, and safeguards--see above, §§ 218 and 219--are\r\nnot a matter of cartels.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cartel Ships.]\r\n\r\n§ 225. Cartel ships[440] are vessels of belligerents which are\r\ncommissioned for the carriage by sea of exchanged prisoners from the\r\nenemy country to their own country, or for the carriage of official\r\ncommunications to and from the enemy. Custom has sanctioned the\r\nfollowing rules regarding these cartel ships for the purpose of securing\r\nprotection for them on the one hand, and, on the other, their exclusive\r\nemployment as a means for the exchange of prisoners: Cartel ships must\r\nnot do any trade or carry any cargo or despatches;[441] they are\r\nespecially not allowed to carry ammunition or instruments of war, except\r\none gun for firing signals. They have to be furnished with a document\r\nfrom an official belonging to the home State of the prisoners and\r\nstationed in the country of the enemy declaring that they are\r\ncommissioned as cartel ships. They are under the protection of both\r\nbelligerents and may neither be seized nor appropriated. They enjoy this\r\nprotection not only when actually carrying exchanged prisoners or\r\nofficial communications, but also on their way home after such carriage\r\nand on their way to fetch prisoners or official communications.[442]\r\nThey lose the protection at once, and may consequently be seized and\r\neventually be appropriated, in case they do not comply, either with the\r\ngeneral rules regarding cartel ships, or with the special conditions\r\nimposed upon them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 440: See above, § 190.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 441: The _La Rosina_ (1800), 2 C.

Capitulations are conventions between armed forces of\r\nbelligerents stipulating the terms of surrender of fortresses and other\r\ndefended places, or of men-of-war, or of troops. It is, therefore,\r\nnecessary to distinguish between a _simple_ and a _stipulated_\r\nsurrender. If one or more soldiers lay down their arms and surrender, or\r\nif a fortress or a man-of-war surrenders without making any terms\r\nwhatever, there is no capitulation, for capitulation is a convention\r\nstipulating the terms of surrender.\r\n\r\nCapitulations are military conventions only and exclusively; they must\r\nnot, therefore, contain arrangements other than those of a local and\r\nmilitary character concerning the surrendering forces, places, or\r\nships. If they do contain such arrangements, the latter are not valid,\r\nunless they are ratified by the political authorities of both\r\nbelligerents.[443] The surrender of a certain place or force may, of\r\ncourse, be arranged by some convention containing other than military\r\nstipulations, but then such surrender would not originate from a\r\ncapitulation. And just as is their character, so the purpose of\r\ncapitulations is merely military--namely, the abandonment of a hopeless\r\nstruggle and resistance which would only involve useless loss of life on\r\nthe part of a hopelessly beset force. Therefore, whatever may be the\r\nindirect consequences of a certain capitulation, its direct consequences\r\nhave nothing to do with the war at large, but are local only and concern\r\nthe surrendering force exclusively.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 443: See Phillimore, III. § 123, who discusses the promise of\r\nLord William Bentinck to Genoa, in 1814, regarding its independence,\r\nwhich was disowned by the British Government. Phillimore himself\r\ndisapproves of the attitude of Great Britain, and so do some foreign\r\npublicists, as, for instance, Despagnet (No. 562); but the rule that\r\ncapitulations are military conventions, and that, therefore, such\r\nstipulations are not valid as are not of a local military character, is\r\nindubitable.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Contents of Capitulations.]\r\n\r\n§ 227. If special conditions are not agreed upon in a capitulation, it\r\nis concluded under the obvious condition that the surrendering force\r\nbecome prisoners of war, and that all war material and other public\r\nproperty in their possession or within the surrendering place or ship\r\nare surrendered in the condition they were at the time when the\r\nsignature was given to the capitulation. Nothing prevents a force\r\nfearing surrender from destroying their provisions, munitions, their\r\narms and other instruments of war which, when falling into the hands of\r\nthe enemy, would be useful to him. Again, nothing prevents a commander,\r\neven after negotiations regarding surrender have begun, from destroying\r\nsuch articles. But when once a capitulation has been signed,[444] such\r\ndestruction is no longer lawful, and, if carried out, constitutes\r\nperfidy which may be punished by the other party as a war crime.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 444: When, during the Russo-Japanese War, in January 1905,\r\nGeneral Stoessel, the Commander of Port Arthur, had fortifications blown\r\nup and vessels sunk, during negotiations for surrender, but before the\r\ncapitulation was signed, the Press undeservedly accused him of perfidy.\r\nU.S. Naval War Code, article 52, enacted the right principle, that\r\n\"_after agreeing upon or signing_ a capitulation, the capitulator must\r\nneither injure nor destroy the vessels, property, or stores in his\r\npossession that he is to deliver up, unless the right to do so is\r\nexpressly reserved to him in the agreement or capitulation.\"]\r\n\r\nBut special conditions may be agreed upon between the forces concerned,\r\nand they must then be faithfully adhered to by both parties. The only\r\nrule which article 35 of the Hague Regulations enacts regarding\r\ncapitulations is that the latter must be in accordance with the demands\r\nof military honour, and that, when once settled, they must be\r\nscrupulously observed. It is instructive to give some instances of\r\npossible conditions:--A condition of a capitulation may be the provision\r\nthat the convention shall be valid only if within a certain period\r\nrelief troops are not approaching. Provision may, further, be made that\r\nthe surrendering forces shall not in every detail be treated like\r\nordinary prisoners of war. Thus it may be stipulated that the officers\r\nor even the soldiers shall be released on parole, that officers\r\nremaining prisoners shall retain their swords. Whether or not a\r\nbelligerent will grant or even offer such specially favourable\r\nconditions depends upon the importance of the force, place, or ship to\r\nbe surrendered, and upon the bravery of the surrendering force. There\r\nare even instances of capitulations which stipulated that the\r\nsurrendering forces should leave the place with full honours, carrying\r\ntheir arms and baggage away and joining their own army unmolested by the\r\nenemy through whose lines they had to march.[445]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 445: During the Franco-German War the Germans granted these\r\nmost favourable conditions to the French forces that surrendered Belfort\r\non February 15, 1871.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Form of Capitulations.]\r\n\r\n§ 228. No rule of International Law exists regarding the form of\r\ncapitulations, which may, therefore, be concluded either orally or in\r\nwriting. But they are usually concluded in writing. Negotiations for\r\nsurrender, from whichever side they emanate, are usually sent under a\r\nflag of truce, but a force which is ready to surrender without special\r\nconditions can indicate their intention by hoisting a white flag as a\r\nsignal that they abandon all and every resistance. The question whether\r\nthe enemy must at once cease firing and accept the surrender, is to be\r\nanswered in the affirmative, provided he is certain that the white flag\r\nwas hoisted by order or with the authority of the commander of the\r\nrespective force. As, however, such hoisting may well have taken place\r\nwithout the authority of the commander and may, therefore, be disowned\r\nby the latter, no duty exists for the enemy to cease his attack until he\r\nis convinced that the white flag really indicates the intention of the\r\ncommander to surrender.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Competence to conclude Capitulations.]\r\n\r\n§ 229. The competence to conclude capitulations is vested in the\r\ncommanders of the forces opposing each other. Capitulations entered into\r\nby unauthorised subordinate officers may, therefore, be disowned by the\r\ncommander concerned without breach of faith. As regards special\r\nconditions of capitulations, it must be particularly noted that the\r\ncompetence of a commander to grant them is limited[446] to those the\r\nfulfilment of which depends entirely upon the forces under his command.\r\nIf he grants conditions against his instructions, his superiors may\r\ndisown such conditions. And the same is valid if he grants conditions\r\nthe fulfilment of which depends upon forces other than his own and upon\r\nsuperior officers. The capitulation in El Arish[447] on January 24,\r\n1800, arranged between the French General Kléber and the Turkish Grand\r\nVizier, and approved by the British Admiral, Sir Sidney Smith, presents\r\nan illustrative example of this rule. As General Kléber, who was\r\ncommanding the French army in Egypt, thought that he could not remain in\r\nEgypt, he proposed surrender under the condition that his army should be\r\nsafely transported to France, carrying away their arms and baggage. The\r\nGrand Vizier accepted these conditions. The British Admiral, Sir Sidney\r\nSmith, who approved of these conditions, was the local commander on the\r\ncoast of Egypt, but was an officer inferior to Lord Keith, the commander\r\nof the British Mediterranean fleet. The latter had, on January 8, 1800,\r\nreceived secret orders, dated December 15, 1799, from the British\r\nGovernment instructing him not to agree to any capitulation which\r\nstipulated the free return of Kléber's army to France. Sir Sidney Smith\r\ndid not, however, receive instructions based on these orders until\r\nFebruary 22, 1800, and, therefore, when he approved of the capitulation\r\nof El Arish in January, was not aware that he acted against orders of\r\nthe British Government.[448] Lord Keith, after having received the above\r\norders on January 8, 1800, wrote at once to General Kléber, pointing out\r\nthat he was not allowed to grant the return of the French army to\r\nFrance.[449] On the other hand, the British Government, after having\r\nbeen informed that Sir Sidney Smith had approved of the return of the\r\nFrench army, sent, on March 28, 1800, fresh orders[450] to Lord Keith,\r\nreceived by him at the end of April, advising him, although Sir Sidney\r\nSmith had exceeded his competence, to allow the capitulation to be\r\ncarried out and the French army to be safely transported to France.\r\nMeanwhile, however, circumstances had entirely changed. When General\r\nKléber had on March 17, 1800, received Lord Keith's letter of January 8,\r\nhe addressed a proclamation,[451] in which Lord Keith's letter was\r\nembodied, to his troops asking them to prepare themselves for battle and\r\nactually began hostilities again on March 20. He was assassinated on\r\nJune 14, and General Menou took over the command, and it was the latter\r\nwho received, on June 20, 1800, information of the changed attitude of\r\nthe British Government regarding the capitulation of El Arish.\r\nHostilities having been renewed as far back as March, General Menou\r\nrefused,[452] on his part, to consent to the carrying out of the\r\ncapitulation, and continued hostilities.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 446: See U.S. Naval War Code, article 51.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 447: Martens, _R._ VII. p. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 448: Martens, _R._ VII. pp. 8 and 9.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 449: Martens, _R._ VII. p. 10.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 450: Martens, _R._ VII. p. 11.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 451: Martens, _R._ VII. p. 15.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 452: Martens, _R._ VII. p. 16.]\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that Sir Sidney Smith, in approving the capitulation,\r\ngranted a condition which did not depend entirely upon himself and the\r\nforces under him, but which depended upon Lord Keith and his fleet. Lord\r\nKeith as well as the British Government could have lawfully disowned\r\nthis condition. That the British Government did not do so, but was ready\r\nto ratify Sir Sidney Smith's approval, was due to the fact that it did\r\nnot want to disavow the promises of Sir Sidney Smith, who was not at the\r\ntime aware of the orders of his Government to Lord Keith. On the other\r\nhand, the French Generals were not wrong in resuming hostilities after\r\nhaving received Lord Keith's first information, as thereby the\r\ncapitulation fell to the ground.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Violation of Capitulations.]\r\n\r\n§ 230. That capitulations must be scrupulously adhered to is an old\r\ncustomary rule, now enacted by article 35 of the Hague Regulations. Any\r\nact contrary to a capitulation would constitute an international\r\ndelinquency if ordered by the belligerent Government concerned, and a\r\nwar crime if committed without such order. Such violation may be met\r\nwith reprisals or punishment of the offenders as war criminals.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nARMISTICES\r\n\r\n  Grotius, III. c. 21, §§ 1-13, c. 22, § 8--Pufendorf, VIII. c. 7,\r\n  §§ 3-12--Vattel, III. §§ 233-260--Hall, § 192--Lawrence, §\r\n  216--Westlake, p. 82--Phillimore, III. §§ 116-121--Halleck, II.\r\n  pp. 311-319--Moore, VII. § 1162--Taylor, §§ 513 and 516--Wheaton,\r\n  §§ 400-404--Bluntschli, §§ 688-699--Heffter, § 142--Lueder in\r\n  Holtzendorff, IV. pp. 531-544--Ullmann, § 186--Bonfils, Nos.\r\n  1248-1258--Despagnet, Nos. 563-566--Pradier-Fodéré, VII.

Armistices or truces, in the wider sense of the term, are all\r\nagreements between belligerent forces for a temporary cessation of\r\nhostilities. They are in no wise to be compared with peace, and ought\r\nnot to be called temporary peace, because the condition of war remains\r\nbetween the belligerents themselves, and between the belligerents and\r\nneutrals on all points beyond the mere cessation of hostilities. In\r\nspite of such cessation the right of visit and search over neutral\r\nmerchantmen therefore remains intact, as does likewise the right to\r\ncapture neutral vessels attempting to break a blockade, and the right to\r\nseize contraband of war. However, although all armistices are\r\nessentially alike in so far as they consist of cessation of hostilities,\r\nthree different kinds must be distinguished--namely, (1) suspensions of\r\narms, (2) general armistices, and (3) partial armistices.[453] It must\r\nbe emphasised that the Hague Regulations deal with armistices in\r\narticles 36 to 41 very incompletely, so that the gaps need filling up\r\nfrom old customary rules.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 453: Although, as will be seen from the following sections,\r\nthis distinction is absolutely necessary, it is not made by several\r\npublicists. Holland, _War_, No. 93, even says: \"There is no difference\r\nof meaning, according to British usage at least, between a 'truce,' an\r\n'armistice,' and a 'suspension of arms.'\" _Land Warfare_, § 256--see in\r\nespecial note (_a_)--accepts the distinction as indispensable.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Suspensions of Arms.]\r\n\r\n§ 232. Suspensions of arms, in contradistinction to armistices in the\r\nnarrower sense of the term, are such cessations of hostilities as are\r\nagreed upon between large or small military or naval forces for a very\r\nshort time and regarding momentary and local military purposes only.\r\nSuch purposes may be--collection of the wounded; burial of the dead;\r\nnegotiation regarding surrender or evacuation of a defended place, or\r\nregarding an armistice in the narrower sense of the term; but may also\r\nbe the creation of a possibility for a commander to ask for and receive\r\ninstructions from a superior authority,[454] and the like. Suspensions\r\nof arms have nothing to do with political purposes, or with the war\r\ngenerally, since they are of momentary and local importance only. They\r\nconcern exclusively those forces and that spot which are the object of\r\nthe suspension of arms. The Hague Regulations do not specially mention\r\nsuspensions of arms, since article 37 speaks of local armistices only,\r\napparently comprising suspensions of arms among local armistices.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 454: An instructive example of a suspension of arms for such\r\npurposes is furnished by the Convention between the German forces\r\nbesieging Belfort and the French forces holding this fortress during the\r\nFranco-German War, signed on February 13, 1871; see Martens, _N.R.G._\r\nXIX. p. 646.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General Armistices.]\r\n\r\n§ 233. A general armistice is such a cessation of hostilities as, in\r\ncontradistinction to suspensions of arms with their momentary and local\r\nmilitary purposes, is agreed upon between belligerents for the whole of\r\ntheir forces and the whole region of war. General armistices are always\r\nconventions of vital political importance affecting the whole of the\r\nwar. They are as a rule, although not necessarily, concluded for a\r\npolitical purpose. It may be that negotiations of peace have ripened so\r\nfar that the end of the war is in sight and that, therefore, military\r\noperations appear superfluous; or that the forces of either belligerent\r\nare exhausted and need rest; or that the belligerents have to face\r\ndomestic difficulties, the settlement of which is more pressing than the\r\ncontinuation of the war; or any other political purpose. Thus article 2\r\nof the general armistice agreed upon at the end of the Franco-German War\r\non January 28, 1871,[455] expressly declared the purpose of the\r\narmistice to be the creation of the possibility for the French\r\nGovernment to convoke a Parliamentary Assembly which could determine\r\nwhether or not the war was to be continued or what conditions of peace\r\nshould be accepted.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 455: Martens, _N.R.G._ XIX. p. 626.]\r\n\r\nIt is of importance to note that, for particular reasons, small parts of\r\nthe belligerent forces and small parts of the theatre of war may be\r\nspecially excluded without detracting from the general character of the\r\narmistice, provided the bulk of the forces and the greater part of the\r\nregion of war are included. Thus, article 1 of the above-mentioned\r\ngeneral armistice at the end of the Franco-German war specially excluded\r\nall military operations in the Départements du Doubs, du Jura, de la\r\nCôte d'Or, and likewise the siege of Belfort. It should also be\r\nmentioned that in the practice of belligerents the terms \"suspension of\r\narms\" and \"general armistice\" are sometimes not sufficiently\r\ndistinguished, but are interchangeable. Thus, for instance, the\r\nabove-mentioned general armistice between France and Germany is entitled\r\n\"Convention entre l'Allemagne et la France pour la suspension des\r\nhostilités, ...\" whereas the different articles of the Convention always\r\nspeak correctly of an armistice, and whereas, further, an annexe to the\r\nConvention signed on January 29 is entitled[456] \"Annexe à la Convention\r\nd'armistice.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 456: Martens, _N.R.G._ XIX. p. 636.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Partial Armistices.]\r\n\r\n§ 234. Partial armistices are agreements for cessations of hostilities\r\nwhich are not concluded by belligerents for their whole forces and the\r\nwhole region of war, but do not merely serve, like suspensions of arms,\r\nmomentary and local military purposes. They are armistices concluded by\r\nbelligerents for a considerable part of their forces and front; they are\r\nalways of political importance affecting the war in general; and they\r\nare very often, although they need not be, agreed upon for political\r\npurposes. Article 37 of the Hague Regulations apparently includes\r\npartial armistices together with suspensions of arms under the term\r\n\"local\" armistices. A partial armistice may be concluded for the\r\nmilitary or the naval forces only; for cessation of hostilities in the\r\ncolonies only; for cessation of hostilities between two of the\r\nbelligerents in case more than two are parties to the war, and the like.\r\nBut it is always a condition that a considerable part of the forces and\r\nregion of war must be included, and that the purpose is not only a\r\nmomentary one.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Competence to conclude Armistices.]\r\n\r\n§ 235. As regards the competence to conclude armistices, a distinction\r\nis necessary between suspensions of arms and general and partial\r\narmistices.\r\n\r\n(1) Since the character and purpose of suspensions of arms are military,\r\nlocal, and momentary only, every commander is supposed to be competent\r\nto agree upon a suspension of arms, and no ratification on the part of\r\nsuperior officers or other authorities is required. Even commanders of\r\nthe smallest opposing detachments may arrange a suspension of arms.\r\n\r\n(2) On the other hand, since general armistices are of vital political\r\nimportance, only the belligerent Governments themselves or their\r\ncommanders-in-chief are competent to conclude them, and ratification,\r\nwhether specially stipulated or not, is necessary. Should a\r\ncommander-in-chief conclude a general armistice which would not find\r\nratification, hostilities may at once be recommenced without breach of\r\nfaith, it being a matter of common knowledge that a commander-in-chief\r\nis not authorised to agree upon exclusion of ratification, unless he\r\nreceived special powers thereto.\r\n\r\n(3) Partial armistices may be concluded by the commanders-in-chief of\r\nthe respective forces, and ratification is not necessary, unless\r\nspecially stipulated; the commanders being responsible to their own\r\nGovernments in case they agree upon a partial armistice without being\r\nspecially authorised thereto.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Form of Armistices.]\r\n\r\n§ 236. No legal rule exists regarding the form of armistices, which may\r\ntherefore be concluded either orally or in writing. However, the\r\nimportance of general as well as partial armistices makes it advisable\r\nto conclude them by signing written documents containing all items which\r\nhave been agreed upon. No instance is known of a general or partial\r\narmistice of modern times concluded otherwise than in writing. But\r\nsuspensions of arms are often only orally concluded.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Contents of Armistices.]\r\n\r\n§ 237. That hostilities must cease is the obvious content of all kinds\r\nof armistices. Usually, although not at all necessarily, the parties\r\nembody special conditions in the agreement instituting an armistice. If\r\nand so far as this has not been done, the import of armistices is for\r\nsome parts much controverted. Everybody agrees that belligerents during\r\nan armistice may, outside the line where the forces face each other, do\r\neverything and anything they like regarding defence and preparation of\r\noffence; for instance, they may manufacture and import munitions and\r\nguns, drill recruits, build fortresses, concentrate or withdraw troops.\r\nBut no unanimity exists regarding such acts as must be left undone or\r\nmay be done within the very line where the belligerent forces face each\r\nother. The majority of writers, led by Vattel (III. § 245), maintain\r\nthat in the absence of special stipulations it is essentially implied in\r\nan armistice that within such line no alteration of the _status quo_\r\nshall take place which the other party, were it not for the armistice,\r\ncould by application of force, for instance by a cannonade or by some\r\nother means, prevent from taking place. These writers consider it a\r\nbreach of faith for a belligerent to make such alterations under the\r\nprotection of the armistice. On the other hand, a small minority of\r\nwriters, but led by Grotius (III. c. 21, § 7) and Pufendorf (VIII. 7, §\r\n7), assert that cessation of hostilities and of further advance only are\r\nessentially implied in an armistice; all other acts, such as\r\nstrengthening of positions by concentration of more troops on the spot,\r\nerection and strengthening of defences, repairing of breaches of\r\nbesieged fortresses, withdrawing of troops, making of fresh batteries on\r\nthe part of besiegers without advancing, and the like, being allowed. As\r\nthe Hague Regulations do not mention the matter, the controversy still\r\nremains unsettled. I believe the opinion of the minority to be correct,\r\nsince an armistice does not mean anything else than a cessation of\r\nactual hostilities, and it is for the parties who agree upon an\r\narmistice to stipulate such special conditions as they think necessary\r\nor convenient. This applies particularly to the other controversial\r\nquestions as to revictualling of besieged places and as to intercourse,\r\ncommercial and otherwise, of the inhabitants of the region where actual\r\nfighting was going on before the armistice. As regards revictualling, it\r\nhas been correctly maintained that, if it were not allowed, the position\r\nof the besieged forces would thereby be weakened by the action of the\r\narmistice. But I cannot see why this should be an argument to hold\r\nrevictualling permissible. The principle _vigilantibus jura sunt\r\nscripta_ applies to armistices as well as to all other legal\r\ntransactions. It is for the parties to prepare such arrangements as\r\nreally suit their needs and wants. Thus, during the Franco-German War an\r\narmistice for twenty-five days proposed in November 1870 fell to the\r\nground on the Germans refusing to grant the revictualling of Paris.[457]\r\nIt seems to be the intention of the Hague Regulations that the parties\r\nshould always stipulate those special conditions which they need.\r\nArticle 39 pronounces this intention regarding intercourse, commercial\r\nand otherwise, during armistices, by the following words:--\"It is for\r\nthe contracting parties to settle in the terms of the armistice what\r\ncommunications may be held within the theatre of war with the population\r\nand with each other.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 457: See Pradier-Fodéré, VII. No. 2908, where the question of\r\nrevictualling during an armistice is discussed at some length, and the\r\nopinions of many publicists from Grotius to our own days are quoted.]\r\n\r\nIt must be specially mentioned that for the purpose of preventing the\r\noutbreak of hostilities during an armistice it is usual to agree upon\r\nso-called lines of demarcation[458]--that is, a small neutral zone\r\nbetween the forces facing each other which must not be entered by\r\nmembers of either force. But such lines of demarcation do not exist, if\r\nthey are not specially stipulated by the armistice concerned.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 458: See Pradier-Fodéré, VII. No. 2901.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Commencement of Armistices.]\r\n\r\n§ 238. In case the contrary is not stipulated, an armistice commences\r\nthe very moment the agreement upon it is complete. But often the parties\r\nstipulate in the agreement the time from which the armistice shall\r\nbegin. If this is done in so detailed a manner that the very hour of the\r\ncommencement is mentioned, no cause for controversy is given. But\r\nsometimes the parties fix only the date by stipulating that the\r\narmistice shall last from one certain day to another, _e.g._ from June\r\n15 to July 15. In such case the actual commencement is controversial.\r\nMost publicists maintain that in such case the armistice begins at 12\r\no'clock of the night between the 14th and the 15th of June, but Grotius\r\n(III. c. 21, § 4) maintains that it begins at 12 o'clock of the night\r\nbetween the 15th and the 16th of June.[459] Therefore, to avoid\r\ndifficulties, agreements concerning armistices ought always to stipulate\r\nwhether the first day is to be included in the armistice. Be that as it\r\nmay, when the forces included in an armistice are dispersed over a very\r\nlarge area, the parties very often stipulate different dates of\r\ncommencement for the different parts of the front, because it is not\r\npossible to announce the armistice at once to all the forces included.\r\nThus, for instance, article 1 of the general armistice at the end of the\r\nFranco-German War[460] stipulated its immediate commencement for the\r\nforces in and around Paris, but that with regard to the other forces its\r\ncommencement should be delayed three days. Article 38 of the Hague\r\nRegulations enacts that an armistice must be notified officially and in\r\ngood time to the competent authorities and the troops, and that\r\nhostilities are suspended immediately after the ratification or at a\r\nfixed date, as the case may be.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 459: See Pradier-Fodéré, VII. No. 2897. The controversy occurs\r\nagain with regard to the end of an armistice; see below, § 240.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 460: Martens, _N.R.G._ XIX. p. 626.]\r\n\r\nIt sometimes happens that hostilities are carried on after the\r\ncommencement of an armistice by forces which did not know of its\r\ncommencement. In such cases the _status quo_ at the date of the\r\ncommencement of armistice has to be re-established so far as possible,\r\nprisoners made and enemy vessels seized being liberated, capitulations\r\nannulled, places occupied evacuated, and the like; but the parties may,\r\nof course, stipulate the contrary.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Violation of Armistices.]\r\n\r\n§ 239. Any violation of armistices is prohibited, and, if ordered by the\r\nGovernments concerned, constitutes an international delinquency. In case\r\nan armistice is violated by members of the forces on their own account,\r\nthe individuals concerned may be punished by the other party in case\r\nthey fall into its hands. Be that as it may, the question must be\r\nanswered, what general attitude is to be taken by one party, if the\r\nother violates the armistice? No unanimity regarding this point exists\r\namong the writers on International Law, many[461] asserting that in case\r\nof violation the other party may at once, without giving notice, re-open\r\nhostilities; others[462] maintaining that such party may not do this,\r\nbut has only the right to denounce the armistice. The Hague Regulations\r\nendeavour to settle the controversy, article 40 enacting that any\r\nserious violation of an armistice by one of the parties gives the other\r\nthe right to denounce it, and even, in case of urgency, to recommence\r\nhostilities at once. Three rules may be formulated from this--(1)\r\nviolations which are not serious do not even give the right to denounce\r\nan armistice; (2) serious violations do as a rule empower the other\r\nparty to denounce only the armistice, but not to recommence hostilities\r\nat once without notice; (3) only in case of urgency is a party justified\r\nin recommencing hostilities without notice, when the other party has\r\nbroken an armistice. But since the terms \"serious violation\" and\r\n\"urgency\" lack precise definition, it is practically left to the\r\ndiscretion of the injured party.\r\n\r\nIt must be specially observed that violation of an armistice committed\r\nby private individuals acting on their own initiative is to be\r\ndistinguished from violation by members of the armed forces. In the\r\nformer case the injured party has, according to article 41 of the Hague\r\nRegulations, only the right of demanding punishment of the offenders,\r\nand, if necessary, indemnity for losses sustained.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 461: See, for instance, Grotius, III. c. 21, § 11; Pufendorf,\r\nVIII. c. 7, § 11; Vattel, III. § 242; Phillimore, II. § 121; Bluntschli,\r\n§ 695; Fiore, III. No. 1494.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 462: See, for instance, Calvo, IV. § 2436; Despagnet, No. 566;\r\nPradier-Fodéré, VII. No. 2913.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: End of Armistices.]\r\n\r\n§ 240. In case an armistice has been concluded for an indefinite period,\r\nthe parties having made no stipulations regarding notice to recommence\r\nhostilities, notice may be given at any time, and hostilities\r\nrecommenced at once after notification. In most cases, however,\r\narmistices are agreed upon for a definite period, and then they expire\r\nwith such period without special notice, unless notification has been\r\nexpressly stipulated. If, in case of an armistice for a definite period,\r\nthe exact hour of the termination has not been agreed upon, but only the\r\ndate, the armistice terminates at twelve o'clock midnight of such date.\r\nIn case an armistice has been arranged to last from one certain day to\r\nanother, _e.g._ from June 15 to July 15, it is again[463] controversial\r\nwhether July 15 is excluded or included. An armistice may, lastly, be\r\nconcluded under a resolutive condition, in which case the occurrence of\r\nthe condition brings the armistice to an end.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 463: See above, § 238.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nMEANS OF SECURING LEGITIMATE WARFARE\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nON MEANS IN GENERAL OF SECURING LEGITIMATE WARFARE\r\n\r\n  Bonfils, Nos. 1014-1017--Spaight, p. 460--_Land Warfare_, §§\r\n  435-438.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Legitimate and Illegitimate Warfare.]\r\n\r\n§ 241. Since war is not a condition of anarchy and lawlessness,\r\nInternational Law requires that belligerents shall comply with its rules\r\nin carrying on their military and naval operations. So long and in so\r\nfar as belligerents do this, their warfare is legitimate; if they do not\r\ncomply with the rules, their warfare is illegitimate. Now, illegitimate\r\nacts and omissions can be committed by belligerent Governments\r\nthemselves, by the commanders or members of their forces, and by their\r\nsubjects not belonging to the forces. Experience teaches that, on the\r\nwhole, omissions and the committal of illegitimate acts on the part of\r\nindividual soldiers are unavoidable during war, since the passions which\r\nare aroused by and during war will always carry away some individuals.\r\nBut belligerents bear a vicarious responsibility for internationally\r\nillegal acts of their soldiers, which turns into original responsibility\r\nif they refuse to repair the wrong done by punishing the offenders and,\r\nif necessary, indemnifying the sufferers.[464] Cases in which\r\nbelligerent Governments themselves commit illegitimate acts, as well as\r\ncases in which they refuse to punish their soldiers for illegitimate\r\nacts constitute international delinquencies.[465] Now, if in time of\r\npeace an international delinquency is committed, the offended State can,\r\nif the worst comes to the worst, make war against the offender to compel\r\nadequate reparation.[466] But if an international delinquency is\r\ncommitted during warfare itself, no means whatever exist of compelling\r\nreparation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 464: See above, vol. I. §§ 149-150.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 465: See above, vol. I. § 151.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 466: See above, vol. I. § 156.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: How Legitimate Warfare is on the whole secured.]\r\n\r\n§ 242. Yet legitimate warfare is, on the whole at any rate, secured\r\nthrough several means recognised by International Law. These means of\r\nsecuring legitimate warfare may be divided into three classes. The first\r\nclass comprises measures of self-help:--reprisals; punishment of war\r\ncrimes committed by enemy soldiers and other enemy subjects; the taking\r\nof hostages. The second class comprises:--complaints lodged with the\r\nenemy; complaints lodged with neutral States; good offices, mediation,\r\nand intervention on the part of neutral States. And there is, thirdly,\r\nthe fact that, according to article 3 of Convention IV. of the Second\r\nPeace Conference, belligerents are responsible for all acts committed by\r\npersons forming part of their forces, and are liable to make\r\ncompensation, if the case demands it, for any violation of the Hague\r\nRegulations. These means, as I have said, do on the whole secure the\r\nlegitimacy of warfare, because it is to the interest of either\r\nbelligerent to prevent the enemy from getting a justifiable opportunity\r\nof making use of them. On the other hand, isolated illegitimate acts of\r\nindividual enemy soldiers will always occur; but they will in many cases\r\nmeet with punishment either by one party to the war or the other. As\r\nregards hostile acts of private enemy individuals not belonging to the\r\narmed forces, belligerents have a right[467] to consider and punish them\r\nseverely as acts of illegitimate warfare.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 467: See below, § 254.]\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nCOMPLAINTS, GOOD OFFICES AND MEDIATION, INTERVENTION\r\n\r\n  _Land Warfare_, §§ 439-440.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Complaints lodged with the Enemy.]\r\n\r\n§ 243. Commanders of forces engaged in hostilities frequently lodge\r\ncomplaints with each other regarding single acts of illegitimate warfare\r\ncommitted by members of their forces, such as abuses of the flag of\r\ntruce, violations of such flag or of the Geneva Convention, and the\r\nlike. The complaint is sent to the enemy under the protection of a flag\r\nof truce, and the interest which every commander takes in the legitimate\r\nbehaviour of his troops will always make him attend to complaints and\r\npunish the offenders, provided the complaints concerned are found to be\r\njustified. Very often, however, it is impossible to verify the\r\nstatements in the complaint, and then certain assertions by one party,\r\nand their denial by the other, face each other without there being any\r\nway of solving the difficulty. It also often happens during war that the\r\nbelligerent Governments lodge with each other mutual complaints of\r\nillegitimate acts and omissions. Since diplomatic intercourse is broken\r\noff during war, such complaints are either sent to the enemy under the\r\nprotection of a flag of truce or through a neutral[468] State which\r\nlends its good offices. But here too indignant assertion and emphatic\r\ndenial frequently face each other without there being a way of solving\r\nthe conflict.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 468: Thus, in October 1904, during the Russo-Japanese War,\r\nJapan sent a complaint concerning the alleged use of Chinese clothing on\r\nthe part of Russian troops to the Russian Government, through the\r\nintermediary of the United States of America; see Takahashi, pp.\r\n174-178.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Complaints lodged with Neutrals.]\r\n\r\n§ 244. If certain grave illegitimate acts or omissions of warfare occur,\r\nbelligerents frequently lodge complaints with neutral States, either\r\nasking their good offices, mediation, or intervention to make the enemy\r\ncomply with the laws of war, or simply drawing their attention to the\r\nfacts. Thus, at the beginning of the Franco-German War, France lodged a\r\ncomplaint with Great Britain and asked her intervention on account of\r\nthe intended creation of a volunteer fleet on the part of Germany, which\r\nFrance considered a violation of the Declaration of Paris.[469]\r\nConversely, in January 1871, Germany, in a circular addressed to her\r\ndiplomatic envoys abroad, and to be communicated to the respective\r\nneutral Governments, complained of twenty-one cases in which the French\r\nforces had, deliberately and intentionally it was alleged, fired on\r\nbearers of a flag of truce. Again, in November 1911, and in February\r\n1912, during the Turco-Italian War, Turkey lodged a complaint with the\r\nPowers on account of the execution of Arabs in Tripoli as war criminals,\r\nand on account of the bombardment of Turkish war vessels in the harbour\r\nof Beirut.[470]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 469: See above, § 84.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 470: See above, § 213.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Good Offices and Mediation.]\r\n\r\n§ 245. Complaints lodged with neutral States may have the effect of one\r\nor more of the latter lending their offices or their mediation to the\r\nbelligerents for the purpose of settling such conflict as arose out of\r\nthe alleged illegitimate acts or omissions of warfare, thus preventing\r\nthem from resorting to reprisals. Such good offices and mediation do not\r\ndiffer from those which settle a difference between States in time of\r\npeace and which have been discussed above in §§ 7-11; they are friendly\r\nacts in contradistinction to intervention, which is dictatorial\r\ninterference for the purpose of making the respective belligerents\r\ncomply with the laws of war.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Intervention on the part of Neutrals.]\r\n\r\n§ 246. There can be no doubt that neutral States, whether a complaint\r\nhas been lodged with them or not, may either singly, or jointly and\r\ncollectively, exercise intervention in cases of illegitimate acts or\r\nomissions of warfare being committed by belligerent Governments, or\r\ncommitted by members of belligerent forces if the Governments concerned\r\ndo not punish the offenders. It will be remembered that it has been\r\nstated above in Vol. I. § 135, No. 4, that other States have a right to\r\nintervene in case a State violates in time of peace or war those\r\nprinciples of the Law of Nations which are universally recognised. There\r\nis not the slightest doubt that such principles of International Law are\r\nendangered in case a belligerent Government commits acts of illegitimate\r\nwarfare or does not punish the offenders in case such acts are committed\r\nby members of its armed forces. But apart from this, the Hague\r\nRegulations make illegitimate acts of warfare on land now appear as by\r\nright the affair of all signatory States to the Convention, and\r\ntherefore, in case of war between signatory States, the neutral\r\nsignatory States certainly would have a right of intervention if acts of\r\nwarfare were committed which are illegitimate according to the Hague\r\nRegulations. It must, however, be specially observed that any such\r\nintervention, if it ever occurred, would have nothing to do with the war\r\nin general and would not make the intervening State a party to the war,\r\nbut would concern only the international delinquency committed by the\r\none belligerent through acts of illegitimate warfare.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nREPRISALS\r\n\r\n  Vattel, III. p. 142--Hall, § 135--Westlake, II. pp. 112-115, and\r\n  _Chapters_, pp. 253-258--Taylor, §§ 487 and 507--Wharton, III. §\r\n  348B--Moore, VII. § 1114--Bluntschli, §§ 567, 580, 654,\r\n  685--Lueder in Holtzendorff, IV. p. 392--Pradier-Fodéré, VIII.\r\n  Nos. 3214-3221--Bonfils, Nos. 1018-1026--Despagnet, No.\r\n  543--Rivier, II. pp. 298-299--Calvo, IV. §§ 2041-2043--Martens,\r\n  II. § 121--Mérignhac, pp. 210-218--Holland, _War_, Nos.\r\n  119-120--Bordwell, p. 305--Spaight, pp. 462-465--_Land Warfare_,\r\n  §§ 452-460--Halleck in _A.J._ VI.

Whereas reprisals in time of peace are to be distinguished from\r\nretorsion and are injurious acts committed for the purpose of compelling\r\na State to consent to a satisfactory settlement of a difference created\r\nthrough an international delinquency,[471] reprisals between\r\nbelligerents are retaliation of an illegitimate act of warfare, whether\r\nconstituting an international delinquency or not, for the purpose of\r\nmaking the enemy comply in future with the rules of legitimate warfare.\r\nReprisals between belligerents are terrible means, because they are in\r\nmost cases directed against innocent enemy individuals, who must suffer\r\nfor real or alleged offences for which they are not responsible. But\r\nreprisals cannot be dispensed with, because without them illegitimate\r\nacts of warfare would be innumerable. As matters stand, every\r\nbelligerent and every member of his forces knows for certain that\r\nreprisals are to be expected in case they violate the rules of\r\nlegitimate warfare. And when nevertheless an illegal act occurs and is\r\npromptly met with reprisals as a retaliation, human nature would not be\r\nwhat it is if such retaliation did not act as a deterrent against a\r\nrepetition of illegitimate acts.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 471: See above, §§ 33 and 42.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reprisals admissible for every Illegitimate Act of Warfare.]\r\n\r\n§ 248. Whereas reprisals in time of peace are admissible for\r\ninternational delinquencies only, reprisals between belligerents are at\r\nonce admissible for every and any act of illegitimate warfare, whether\r\nthe act constitutes an international delinquency or not. It is for the\r\nconsideration of the injured belligerent as to whether he will at once\r\nresort to reprisals, or, before doing so, will lodge complaints with the\r\nenemy or with neutral States. Practically, however, a belligerent will\r\nrarely resort at once to reprisals, provided the violation of the rules\r\nof legitimate warfare is not very grave and the safety of his troops\r\ndoes not require prompt and drastic measures. Thus, the Germans during\r\nthe Franco-German War frequently by way of reprisal, bombarded and fired\r\nundefended open villages where their soldiers were treacherously killed\r\nby enemy individuals in ambush who did not belong to the armed forces.\r\nAnd Lord Roberts, during the South African War, ordered[472] by way of\r\nreprisal the destruction of houses and farms in the vicinity of the\r\nplace where damage was done to the lines of communication.[473]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 472: See section 4 of the Proclamation of June 19, 1900\r\n(Martens, _N.R.G._ 2nd Ser., XXXII. p. 147), and Beak, _The Aftermath of\r\nWar_ (1906), p. 11.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 473: That prisoners of war may be made the objects of\r\nreprisals for acts of illegitimate warfare committed by the enemy, there\r\nis hardly any doubt; see Beinhauer, _Die Kriegsgefangenschaft_ (1910),\r\np. 74.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Danger of Arbitrariness in Reprisals.]\r\n\r\n§ 249. The right to exercise reprisals carries with it great danger of\r\narbitrariness, for often the alleged facts which make belligerents\r\nresort to reprisals are not sufficiently verified, or the rules of war\r\nwhich they consider the enemy has violated are sometimes not generally\r\nrecognised, or the act of reprisal performed is often excessive compared\r\nwith the precedent act of illegitimate warfare. Three cases may\r\nillustrate this danger.\r\n\r\n(1) In 1782 Joshua Huddy, a captain in the army of the American\r\ninsurgents, was taken prisoner by loyalists and handed over to a Captain\r\nLippencott for the ostensible purpose of being exchanged, but was\r\narbitrarily hanged. The commander of the British troops had Lippencott\r\narrested, and ordered him to be tried for murder. Lippencott was,\r\nhowever, acquitted by the court-martial, as there was evidence to show\r\nthat his command to execute Huddy was in accordance with orders of a\r\nBoard which he was bound to obey. Thereupon some British officers who\r\nwere prisoners of war in the hands of the Americans were directed to\r\ncast lots to determine who should be executed by way of reprisal for the\r\nexecution of Huddy. The lot fell on Captain Asgill, a young officer only\r\nnineteen years old, and he would have been executed but for the\r\nmediation of the Queen of France, who saved his life.[474]\r\n\r\n(2) \"The British Government, having sent to England, early in 1813, to\r\nbe tried for treason, twenty-three Irishmen, naturalised in the United\r\nStates, who had been captured on vessels of the United States, Congress\r\nauthorised the President to retaliate. Under this act, General Dearborn\r\nplaced in close confinement twenty-three prisoners taken at Fort George.\r\nGeneral Prevost, under express directions of Lord Bathurst, ordered the\r\nclose imprisonment of double the number of commissioned and\r\nnon-commissioned United States' officers. This was followed by a threat\r\nof 'unmitigated severity against the American citizens and villages' in\r\ncase the system of retaliation was pursued. Mr. Madison having retorted\r\nby putting in confinement a similar number of British officers taken by\r\nthe United States, General Prevost immediately retorted by subjecting to\r\nthe same discipline all his prisoners whatsoever.... A better temper,\r\nhowever, soon came over the British Government, by whom this system had\r\nbeen instituted. A party of United States' officers, who were prisoners\r\nof war in England, were released on parole, with instructions to state\r\nto the President that the twenty-three prisoners who had been charged\r\nwith treason in England had not been tried, but remained on the usual\r\nbasis of prisoners of war. This led to the dismissal on parole of all\r\nthe officers of both sides.\"[475]\r\n\r\n(3) During the Franco-German War the French had captured forty German\r\nmerchantmen, and made their captains and crews prisoners of war. Count\r\nBismarck, who considered it against International Law to detain these\r\nmen as prisoners, demanded their liberation, and when the French refused\r\nthis, ordered by way of reprisal forty French private individuals of\r\nlocal importance to be arrested and to be sent as prisoners of war to\r\nBremen, where they were kept until the end of the war. Count Bismarck\r\nwas decidedly wrong,[476] since France had, as the law then stood, in no\r\nway committed an illegal act by detaining the German crews as prisoners\r\nof war.[477]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 474: See the case reported in Martens, _Causes Célèbres_, III,\r\npp. 311-321. See also Phillimore, III. § 105.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 475: See Wharton, III. § 348B.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 476: That Bismarck's standpoint was wrong has been pointed out\r\nabove in § 201. Some German writers, however, take his part; see, for\r\ninstance, Lueder in Holtzendorff, IV. p. 479, note 6. As regards the\r\npresent law on the subject, see above, §§ 85 and 201.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 477: The case is one of reprisals, and has nothing to do with\r\nthe taking of hostages; see below, § 258.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Proposed Restriction of Reprisals.]\r\n\r\n§ 250. The Hague Regulations do not mention reprisals at all because the\r\nBrussels Conference of 1874, which accepted the unratified Brussels\r\nDeclaration, had struck out several sections of the Russian draft code\r\nregarding reprisals. These original sections[478] (69-71)\r\nstipulated--(1) that reprisals should be admitted only in extreme cases\r\nof absolutely certain violations of the rules of legitimate warfare; (2)\r\nthat the acts performed by way of reprisal must not be excessive, but in\r\nproportion to the respective violation; (3) that reprisals should be\r\nordered by commanders-in-chief only. Articles 85 and 86 of the Manual of\r\nthe Laws of War, adopted by the Institute of International Law,[479]\r\npropose the following rules:--(1) Reprisals are to be prohibited in\r\ncase reparation is given for the damage done by an illegal act; (2) in\r\ngrave cases, in which reprisals are an imperative necessity, they must\r\nnever exceed the degree of the violation committed by the enemy; (3)\r\nthey may only be resorted to with the authorisation of the\r\ncommander-in-chief; (4) they must in every case respect the laws of\r\nhumanity and of morality. In face of the arbitrariness with which,\r\naccording to the present state of International Law, reprisals may be\r\nexercised, it cannot be denied that an agreement upon some precise rules\r\nregarding reprisals is an imperative necessity.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 478: See Martens, _N.R.G._ 2nd Ser.

In contradistinction to hostile acts of soldiers by which the\r\nlatter do not lose their privilege of being treated as members of armed\r\nforces who have done no wrong, war crimes are such hostile or other acts\r\nof soldiers or other individuals as may be punished by the enemy on\r\ncapture of the offenders. It must, however, be emphasised that the term\r\nwar crime is used, not in the moral sense of the term crime, but only in\r\na technical legal sense, on account of the fact that perpetrators of\r\nthese acts may be punished by the enemy. For, although among the acts\r\ncalled war crimes are many which are crimes in the moral sense of the\r\nterm, such, for instance, as the abuse of a flag of truce or\r\nassassination of enemy soldiers; there are others which may be highly\r\npraiseworthy and patriotic acts, such as taking part in a levy _en\r\nmasse_ on territory occupied by the enemy. But because every belligerent\r\nmay, and actually must, in the interest of his own safety punish these\r\nacts, they are termed war crimes, whatever may be the motive, the\r\npurpose, and the moral character of the respective act.[480]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 480: See above, § 57.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Different kinds of War Crimes.]\r\n\r\n§ 252. In spite of the uniform designation of these acts as war crimes,\r\nfour different kinds of war crimes must be distinguished on account of\r\nthe essentially different character of the acts. Violations of\r\nrecognised rules regarding warfare committed by members of the armed\r\nforces belong to the first kind; all hostilities in arms committed by\r\nindividuals who are not members of the enemy armed forces constitute the\r\nsecond kind; espionage and war treason belong to the third; and all\r\nmarauding acts belong to the fourth kind.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Violations of Rules regarding Warfare.]\r\n\r\n§ 253. Violations of rules regarding warfare are war crimes only when\r\ncommitted without an order of the belligerent Government concerned. If\r\nmembers of the armed forces commit violations _by order_ of their\r\nGovernment, they are not war criminals and may not be punished by the\r\nenemy; the latter may, however, resort to reprisals. In case members of\r\nforces commit violations ordered by their commanders, the members may\r\nnot be punished, for the commanders are alone responsible, and the\r\nlatter may, therefore, be punished as war criminals on their capture by\r\nthe enemy.\r\n\r\nThe following are the more important violations that may occur:\r\n\r\n(1) Making use of poisoned or otherwise forbidden arms and ammunition.\r\n\r\n(2) Killing or wounding soldiers disabled by sickness or wounds, or who\r\nhave laid down arms and surrendered.\r\n\r\n(3) Assassination, and hiring of assassins.\r\n\r\n(4) Treacherous request for quarter, or treacherous feigning of sickness\r\nand wounds.\r\n\r\n(5) Ill-treatment of prisoners of war, of the wounded and sick.\r\nAppropriation of such of their money and valuables as are not public\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\n(6) Killing or attacking harmless private enemy individuals. Unjustified\r\nappropriation and destruction of their private property, and especially\r\npillaging. Compulsion of the population of occupied territory to furnish\r\ninformation about the army of the other belligerent or about his means\r\nof defence.\r\n\r\n(7) Disgraceful treatment of dead bodies on battlefields. Appropriation\r\nof such money and other valuables found upon dead bodies as are not\r\npublic property, nor arms, ammunition, and the like.\r\n\r\n(8) Appropriation and destruction of property belonging to museums,\r\nhospitals, churches, schools, and the like.\r\n\r\n(9) Assault, siege, and bombardment of undefended open towns and other\r\nhabitations. Unjustified bombardment of undefended places on the part of\r\nnaval forces.\r\n\r\n(10) Unnecessary bombardment of historical monuments, and of such\r\nhospitals and buildings devoted to religion, art, science, and charity,\r\nas are indicated by particular signs notified to the besiegers\r\nbombarding a defended town.\r\n\r\n(11) Violations of the Geneva Convention.\r\n\r\n(12) Attack on or sinking of enemy vessels which have hauled down their\r\nflags as a sign of surrender. Attack on enemy merchantmen without\r\nprevious request to submit to visit.\r\n\r\n(13) Attack or seizure of hospital ships, and all other violations of\r\nthe Hague Convention for the adaptation to naval warfare of the\r\nprinciples of the Geneva Convention.\r\n\r\n(14) Unjustified destruction of enemy prizes.[481]\r\n\r\n(15) Use of enemy uniforms and the like during battle, use of the enemy\r\nflag during attack by a belligerent vessel.\r\n\r\n(16) Violation of enemy individuals furnished with passports or\r\nsafe-conducts, violation of safeguards.\r\n\r\n(17) Violation of bearers of flags of truce.\r\n\r\n(18) Abuse of the protection granted to flags of truce.\r\n\r\n(19) Violation of cartels, capitulations, and armistices.\r\n\r\n(20) Breach of parole.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 481: Unjustified destruction of neutral prizes--see below, §\r\n431--is not a war crime, but is nevertheless an international\r\ndelinquency, if ordered by the belligerent government.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hostilities in Arms by Private Individuals.]\r\n\r\n§ 254. Since International Law is a law between States only and\r\nexclusively, no rules of International Law can exist which prohibit\r\nprivate individuals from taking up arms and committing hostilities\r\nagainst the enemy. But private individuals committing such acts do not\r\nenjoy the privileges of members of armed forces, and the enemy has\r\naccording to a customary rule of International Law the right to consider\r\nand punish such individuals as war criminals. Hostilities in arms\r\ncommitted by private individuals are not war crimes because they really\r\nare violations of recognised rules regarding warfare, but because the\r\nenemy has the right to consider and punish them as acts of illegitimate\r\nwarfare. The conflict between praiseworthy patriotism on the part of\r\nsuch individuals and the safety of the enemy troops does not allow of\r\nany solution. It would be unreasonable for International Law to impose\r\nupon belligerents the duty to forbid the taking up of arms by their\r\nprivate subjects, because such action may occasionally be of the\r\ngreatest value to a belligerent, especially for the purpose of freeing a\r\ncountry from the enemy who has militarily occupied it. Nevertheless the\r\nsafety of his troops compels the enemy to consider and punish such\r\nhostilities as acts of illegitimate warfare, and International Law gives\r\nhim a right to do so.\r\n\r\nIt is usual to make a distinction between hostilities in arms on the\r\npart of private individuals against an invading or retiring enemy on the\r\none hand, and, on the other, hostilities in arms committed on the part\r\nof the inhabitants against an enemy occupying a conquered territory. In\r\nthe latter case one speaks of war rebellion, whether inhabitants take up\r\narms singly or rise in a so-called levy _en masse_. Articles 1 and 2 of\r\nthe Hague Regulations make the greatest possible concessions regarding\r\nhostilities committed by irregulars.[482] Beyond the limits of these\r\nconcessions belligerents will never be able to go without the greatest\r\ndanger to their troops.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 482: See above, §§ 80 and 81.]\r\n\r\nIt must be particularly noted that merchantmen of belligerents, which\r\nattack enemy vessels without previously having been attacked by them,\r\ncommit a war crime,[483] and that the captains, officers, and members of\r\nthe crews may, therefore, be punished as war criminals to the same\r\nextent as private individuals who commit hostilities in land warfare.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 483: See above, §§ 85 and 181.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Espionage and War Treason.]\r\n\r\n§ 255. Article 24 of the Hague Regulations now enacts the old customary\r\nrule that a belligerent has a right to employ all methods necessary to\r\nobtain information, and these methods include espionage and treason. But\r\nthis right stands face to face with the right to consider and punish as\r\nwar criminals enemy individuals, whether soldiers or not, committing\r\nacts of espionage or treason. There is an irreconcilable conflict\r\nbetween the necessity of obtaining information on the one hand, and\r\nself-preservation on the other; and accordingly espionage and treason,\r\nas has been explained above in § 159, bear a twofold character. On the\r\none hand, International Law gives a right to belligerents to make use of\r\nespionage and treason. On the other hand, the same law gives a right to\r\nbelligerents to consider espionage and treason, committed by enemy\r\nsoldiers or enemy private individuals within their lines, as acts of\r\nillegitimate warfare, and consequently punishable.\r\n\r\nEspionage has already been treated above in §§ 159-161. War treason may\r\nbe committed in different ways. The following are the chief cases of war\r\ntreason that may occur:--\r\n\r\n(1) Information of any kind given to the enemy.\r\n\r\n(2) Voluntary supply of money, provisions, ammunition, horses, clothing,\r\nand the like, to the enemy.\r\n\r\n(3) Any voluntary assistance to military operations of the enemy, be it\r\nby serving as guide in the country, by opening the door of a defended\r\nhabitation, by repairing a destroyed bridge, or otherwise.\r\n\r\n(4) Attempt to induce soldiers to desert, to surrender, to serve as\r\nspies, and the like, and negotiating desertion, surrender, and espionage\r\noffered by soldiers.\r\n\r\n(5) Attempt to bribe soldiers or officials in the interest of the enemy,\r\nand negotiating such bribe.\r\n\r\n(6) Liberation of enemy prisoners of war.\r\n\r\n(7) Conspiracy against the armed forces or against individual officers\r\nand members of them.\r\n\r\n(8) Wrecking of military trains, destruction of the lines of\r\ncommunication or of the telegraphs or telephones in the interest of the\r\nenemy, and the destruction of any war material for the same purpose.\r\n\r\n(9) Circulation of enemy proclamations dangerous to the interests of the\r\nbelligerent concerned.\r\n\r\n(10) Intentional false guidance of troops by a hired guide or by one who\r\noffered his services voluntarily.\r\n\r\n(11) Rendering courier or similar services to the enemy.\r\n\r\nIt must be specially observed that enemy soldiers--in contradistinction\r\nto private enemy individuals--may only be punished for war treason when\r\nthey have committed the act of treason during their stay within a\r\nbelligerent's lines under disguise. If, for instance, two soldiers in\r\nuniform are sent into the rear of the enemy for the purpose of\r\ndestroying a bridge, they may not, when caught by the enemy, be punished\r\nfor war treason, because their act was one of legitimate warfare. But if\r\nthey exchange their uniforms for plain clothes and thereby appear as\r\nmembers of the peaceful private population, they may be punished for war\r\ntreason. A remarkable case of this kind occurred in the summer of 1904,\r\nduring the Russo-Japanese War. Two Japanese disguised in Chinese clothes\r\nwere caught in the attempt to destroy, with the aid of dynamite, a\r\nrailway bridge in Manchuria, in the rear of the Russian forces. Brought\r\nbefore a court-martial, they confessed themselves to be Shozo Jakoga,\r\nforty-three years of age, a Major on the Japanese General Staff, and\r\nTeisuki Oki, thirty-one years of age, a Captain on the Japanese General\r\nStaff. They were convicted, and condemned to be hanged, but the mode of\r\npunishment was changed and they were shot. All the newspapers which\r\nmentioned this case reported it as a case of espionage, but it is in\r\nfact one of war treason. Although the two officers were in disguise,\r\ntheir conviction for espionage was impossible according to article 29 of\r\nthe Hague Regulations, provided, of course, they were court-martialed\r\nfor no other act than the attempt to destroy a bridge.\r\n\r\nIt must be particularly noted that there are many acts of inhabitants\r\nwhich a belligerent may forbid and punish in the interests of order and\r\nthe safety of his army, although these acts do not fall under the\r\ncategory of war treason, and are not therefore punished as war crimes.\r\nTo this class belong all acts which violate the orders legitimately\r\ndecreed by an occupant of enemy territory.[484]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 484: See _Land Warfare_, § 446.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Marauding.]\r\n\r\n§ 256. Marauders are individuals roving either singly or collectively in\r\nbands over battlefields, or following advancing or retreating forces in\r\nquest of booty. They have nothing to do with warfare in the strict sense\r\nof the term, but they are an unavoidable accessory to warfare and\r\nfrequently consist of soldiers who have left their corps. Their acts are\r\nconsidered acts of illegitimate warfare, and their punishment takes\r\nplace in the interest of the safety of either belligerent.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mode of Punishment of War Crimes.]\r\n\r\n§ 257. All war crimes may be punished with death, but belligerents may,\r\nof course, inflict a more lenient punishment, or commute a sentence of\r\ndeath into a more lenient penalty. If this be done and imprisonment take\r\nthe place of capital punishment, the question arises whether such\r\nconvicts must be released at the end of the war, although their term of\r\nimprisonment has not yet expired. Some publicists[485] answer this\r\nquestion in the affirmative, maintaining that it could never be lawful\r\nto inflict a penalty extending beyond the duration of the war. But I\r\nbelieve that the question has to be answered in the negative. If a\r\nbelligerent has a right to pronounce a sentence of capital punishment,\r\nit is obvious that he may select a more lenient penalty and carry the\r\nlatter out even beyond the duration of the war. And it would in no wise\r\nbe in the interest of humanity to deny this right, for otherwise\r\nbelligerents would have always to pronounce and carry out sentence of\r\ncapital punishment in the interest of self-preservation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 485: See, for instance, Hall, § 135, p. 432.]\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nTAKING OF HOSTAGES\r\n\r\n  Hall, §§ 135 and 156--Taylor, § 525--Bluntschli, § 600--Lueder in\r\n  Holtzendorff, IV. pp. 475-477--Klüber, §§ 156 and 247--G.

The practice of taking hostages as a means of securing legitimate\r\nwarfare prevailed in former times much more than nowadays. It was\r\nfrequently resorted to in cases in which belligerent forces depended\r\nmore or less upon each other's good faith, such as capitulations and\r\narmistices for instance. To make sure that no perfidy was intended,\r\nofficers or prominent private individuals were taken as hostages and\r\ncould be held responsible with their lives for any perfidy committed by\r\nthe enemy. This practice has totally disappeared, and is hardly likely\r\nto be revived. But this former practice must not be confounded with the\r\nstill existing practice of seizing enemy individuals for the purpose of\r\nmaking them the object of reprisals. Thus, when in 1870, during the\r\nFranco-German War, Count Bismarck ordered forty French notables to be\r\nseized and to be taken away into captivity as a retaliation upon the\r\nFrench for refusing to liberate the crews of forty captured merchantmen,\r\nthese forty French notables were not taken as hostages, but were made\r\nthe object of reprisals.[486]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 486: The case has been discussed above in § 249. All the\r\nFrench writers who comment upon this case make the mistake of referring\r\nto it as an instance of the taking of hostages.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Modern Practice of taking Hostages.]\r\n\r\n§ 259. A new practice of taking hostages was resorted to by the Germans\r\nin 1870 during the Franco-German War for the purpose of securing the\r\nsafety of forces against possible hostile acts on the part of private\r\ninhabitants of occupied enemy territory. Well-known men were seized and\r\ndetained in the expectation that the population would refrain from\r\nhostile acts out of regard for the fate of the hostages. Thus, when\r\nunknown people frequently wrecked the trains transporting troops, the\r\nGermans seized prominent enemy citizens and put them on the engines of\r\ntrains to prevent the latter from being wrecked, a means which always\r\nproved effective and soon put a stop to further train-wrecking. The same\r\npractice was resorted to, although for a short time only, by Lord\r\nRoberts[487] in 1900 during the South African War. This practice has\r\nbeen condemned by the majority of publicists. But, with all due\r\ndeference to the authority of so many prominent men who oppose the\r\npractice, I cannot agree with their opinion. Matters would be different\r\nif hostages were seized and exposed to dangers for the purpose of\r\npreventing legitimate hostilities on the part of members of the armed\r\nforces of the enemy.[488] But no one can deny that train-wrecking on\r\noccupied enemy territory by private enemy individuals is an act which a\r\nbelligerent is justified in considering and punishing as war\r\ntreason.[489] It is for the purpose of guarding against an act of\r\nillegitimate warfare that these hostages are put on the engines. The\r\ndanger they are exposed to comes from their fellow-citizens, who are\r\ninformed of the fact that hostages are on the engines and who ought\r\ntherefore to refrain from wrecking the trains. It cannot, and will not,\r\nbe denied that the measure is a harsh one, and that it makes individuals\r\nliable to suffer for acts for which they are not responsible. But the\r\nsafety of his troops and lines of communication is at stake for the\r\nbelligerent concerned, and I doubt, therefore, whether even the most\r\nhumane commanders will be able to dispense with this measure, since it\r\nalone has proved effective. And it must further be taken into\r\nconsideration that the amount of cruelty connected with it is no greater\r\nthan in reprisals where also innocent individuals must suffer for\r\nillegitimate acts for which they are not responsible. And is it not more\r\nreasonable to prevent train-wrecking by putting hostages on the engines\r\nthan to resort to reprisals for wreckage of trains? For there is no\r\ndoubt that a belligerent is justified in resorting to reprisals[490] in\r\neach case of train-wrecking by private enemy individuals.[491]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 487: See section 3 of the Proclamation of Lord Roberts, dated\r\nPretoria, June 19, 1900, but this section was repealed by the\r\nProclamation of July 29, 1900.

XXXII.\r\n(1905), pp. 147 and 149.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 488: _Land Warfare_, § 463, does not consider the practice\r\ncommendable, because innocent citizens are thereby exposed to legitimate\r\nacts of train-wrecking on the part of raiding parties of armed forces of\r\nthe enemy.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 489: See above, § 255, No. 8.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 490: See above, § 248.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 491: Belligerents sometimes take hostages to secure compliance\r\nwith requisitions, contributions, ransom bills, and the like, but such\r\ncases have nothing to do with illegitimate warfare: see above, § 116, p.\r\n153, note 1, and § 170, p. 213, note 3.

There is no doubt that, if a belligerent can be made to pay\r\ncompensation for all damage done by him in violating the laws of war,\r\nthis will be an indirect means of securing legitimate warfare. In former\r\ntimes no rule existed which stipulated such compensation, although, of\r\ncourse, violation of the laws of war was always an international\r\ndelinquency. On the contrary, it was an established customary rule[492]\r\nthat claims for reparation of damages caused by violations of the rules\r\nof legitimate warfare could not be raised after the conclusion of peace,\r\nunless the contrary was expressly stipulated. It was not until the\r\nSecond Hague Peace Conference that matters underwent a change. In\r\nrevising the Convention concerning the laws and customs of war on land,\r\nbesides other alterations, a new article (3) was adopted which enacts\r\nthat a belligerent who violates the provisions of the Hague Regulations,\r\nshall, if the case demand, be liable to make compensation, and that he\r\nshall be responsible for all acts committed by persons forming part of\r\nhis armed forces.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 492: See below, § 274, p. 335.]\r\n\r\nAttention should be drawn to the fact that Germany, on whose initiative\r\nthis principle was adopted, proposed two articles concerning the matter,\r\nthe one dealing with the payment of compensation for violations of the\r\nHague Regulations with regard to subjects of neutral States,[493] and\r\nthe other for violations of these Regulations with regard to enemy\r\nsubjects. The conference, however, preferred to make no distinction\r\nbetween the different cases of violation but to adopt the general\r\nprinciple.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 493: See below, § 357.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Compensation for Violations of the Hague Regulations.]\r\n\r\n§ 259_b_. It is apparent that article 3 of Convention IV. enacts two\r\ndifferent rules: firstly, that a belligerent who violates the Hague\r\nRegulations shall, if the case demand, pay compensation; and secondly,\r\nthat a belligerent is responsible for all acts committed by any person\r\nforming part of his armed forces.\r\n\r\nTo take this second rule first, the responsibility of a State for\r\ninternationally illegal acts on the part of members of its armed forces\r\nis, provided the acts have not been committed by the State's command or\r\nauthorisation, only a vicarious responsibility, but nevertheless the\r\nState concerned must, as was pointed out above, Vol. I. § 163, pay\r\ndamages for these acts when required. For this reason, article 3 does\r\nnot create a new rule in so far as it enacts that belligerents must pay\r\nfor damage caused by members of their forces.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the rule that compensation must be paid by\r\nbelligerents for damage done through violations of the Hague\r\nRegulations, is a new rule, at any rate in so far as it is laid down in\r\na general way. If interpreted according to the letter, article 3 of\r\nConvention IV. establishes the rule for payment of compensation for\r\nviolations of the Hague Regulations only, and not for violations of\r\nother rules of International Law concerning land warfare or even\r\nconcerning sea warfare. I have, however, no doubt that the Powers would\r\nrecognise that the principle of article 3 must find application to any\r\nrule of the laws of war, if by the violation of such rule subjects of\r\nthe enemy, or of neutral States, suffer damage. For instance, if the\r\ncommander of a naval force, in contravention of Convention IX. of the\r\nSecond Peace Conference, were to bombard an undefended place,\r\ncompensation could be claimed for such subjects of the enemy and\r\nsubjects of neutral States as suffered damage through the bombardment.\r\n\r\nA point, however, to be kept in view is that article 3, although it\r\nestablishes the obligation to pay compensation, does not stipulate\r\nanything concerning the time or the way in which claims for compensation\r\nare to be settled. This is clearly a case for arbitration, and it is to\r\nbe hoped that the Third Peace Conference will make arbitration\r\nobligatory in cases of claims for compensation arising from violations,\r\non the part of a belligerent, of the Hague Regulations as well as of\r\nother laws of war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nEND OF WAR, AND POSTLIMINIUM\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nON TERMINATION OF WAR IN GENERAL\r\n\r\n  Hall, § 197--Lawrence, § 217--Phillimore, III. § 510--Taylor, §\r\n  580--Moore, VII. § 1163--Heffter, § 176--Kirchenheim in\r\n  Holtzendorff, IV. pp. 791-792--Ullmann, § 198--Bonfils, No.\r\n  1692--Despagnet, No. 605--Calvo, V. § 3115--Fiore, III.

The normal condition between two States being peace, war can\r\nnever be more than a temporary condition; whatever may have been the\r\ncause or causes of a war, the latter cannot possibly last for ever. For\r\neither the purpose of war will be realised and one belligerent will be\r\noverpowered by the other, or both will sooner or later be so exhausted\r\nby their exertions that they will desist from the struggle. Nevertheless\r\nwars may last for many years, although of late European wars have\r\ngradually become shorter. The shortening of European wars in recent\r\ntimes has resulted from several causes, the more important of which\r\nare:--conscription, the foundation of the armies of all the great\r\nEuropean Powers, Great Britain excepted; the net of railways which\r\nextends over all European countries, and which enables a much quicker\r\ntransport of troops on enemy territory; and lastly, the vast numbers of\r\nthe opposing forces which usually hasten a decisive battle.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Three Modes of Termination of War.]\r\n\r\n§ 261. Be that as it may, a war may be terminated in three different\r\nways. Belligerents may, first, abstain from further acts of war and\r\nglide into peaceful relations without expressly making peace through a\r\nspecial treaty. Or, secondly, belligerents may formally establish the\r\ncondition of peace through a special treaty of peace. Or, thirdly, a\r\nbelligerent may end the war through subjugation of his adversary.[494]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 494: That a civil war may come to an end through simple\r\ncessation of hostilities or through a treaty of peace need hardly be\r\nmentioned. But it is of importance to state the fact that there is a\r\ndifference between civil war and other war concerning the third mode of\r\nending war, namely subjugation. For to terminate a civil war, conquest\r\n_and_ annexation, which together make subjugation, is unnecessary (see\r\nbelow, § 264), but conquest alone is sufficient.]\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nSIMPLE CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES\r\n\r\n  Hall, § 203--Phillimore, III. § 511--Halleck, II. p. 468--Taylor,\r\n  § 584--Bluntschli, § 700--Heffter, § 177--Kirchenheim in\r\n  Holtzendorff, IV. p. 793--Ullmann, § 198--Bonfils, No.\r\n  1693--Despagnet, No. 605--Rivier, II. pp. 435-436--Calvo, V. §\r\n  3116--Fiore, III. No. 1693--Martens, II. § 128--Longuet, §\r\n  155--Mérignhac, p. 323--Pillet, p. 370.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Exceptional Occurrence of simple Cessation of Hostilities.]\r\n\r\n§ 262. The regular modes of termination of war are treaties of peace or\r\nsubjugation, but cases have occurred in which simple cessation of all\r\nacts of war on the part of both belligerents has actually and informally\r\nbrought the war to an end. Thus ended in 1716 the war between Sweden and\r\nPoland, in 1720 the war between Spain and France, in 1801 the war\r\nbetween Russia and Persia, in 1867 the war between France and Mexico.\r\nAnd it may also be mentioned that, whereas the war between Prussia and\r\nseveral German States in 1866 came to an end through subjugation of some\r\nStates and through treaties of peace with others, Prussia has never\r\nconcluded a treaty of peace with the Principality of Lichtenstein, which\r\nwas also a party to the war. Although such termination of war through\r\nsimple cessation of hostilities is for many reasons inconvenient, and\r\nis, therefore, as a rule avoided, it may nevertheless in the future as\r\nin the past occasionally occur.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effect of Termination of War through simple Cessation of\r\nHostilities.]\r\n\r\n§ 263. Since in the case of termination of war through simple cessation\r\nof hostilities no treaty of peace embodies the conditions of peace\r\nbetween the former belligerents, the question arises whether the\r\n_status_ which existed between the parties before the outbreak of war,\r\nthe _status quo ante bellum_, should be revived, or the _status_ which\r\nexists between the parties at the time when they simply ceased\r\nhostilities, the _status quo post bellum_ (the _uti possidetis_), can be\r\nupheld. The majority of publicists[495] correctly maintain that the\r\n_status_ which exists at the time of cessation of hostilities becomes\r\nsilently recognised through such cessation, and is, therefore, the basis\r\nof the future relations of the parties. This question is of the greatest\r\nimportance regarding enemy territory militarily occupied by a\r\nbelligerent at the time hostilities cease. According to the correct\r\nopinion such territory can be annexed by the occupier, the adversary\r\nthrough the cessation of hostilities having dropped all rights he\r\npossessed over such territory. On the other hand, this termination of\r\nwar through cessation of hostilities contains no decision regarding such\r\nclaims of the parties as have not been settled by the actual position of\r\naffairs at the termination of hostilities, and it remains for the\r\nparties to settle them by special agreement or to let them stand over.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 495: See, however, Phillimore, III. § 511, who maintains that\r\nthe _status quo ante bellum_ has to be revived.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nSUBJUGATION\r\n\r\n  Vattel, III. §§ 199-203--Hall, §§ 204-205--Lawrence, §\r\n  77--Phillimore, III. § 512--Halleck, I. pp. 467-498--Taylor, §§\r\n  220, 585-588--Moore, I. § 87--Walker, § 11--Wheaton, §\r\n  165--Bluntschli, §§ 287-289, 701-702--Heffter, § 178--Kirchenheim\r\n  in Holtzendorff, IV. p. 792--Liszt, § 10--Ullmann, §§ 92, 97, and\r\n  197--Bonfils, Nos. 535 and 1694--Despagnet, Nos. 387-390,\r\n  605--Rivier, II. pp. 436-441--Calvo, V. §§ 3117-3118--Fiore, II.\r\n  Nos. 863, III.

(1901), p.\r\n  392.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Subjugation in contradistinction to Conquest.]\r\n\r\n§ 264. Subjugation must not be confounded with conquest, although there\r\ncan be no subjugation without conquest. Conquest is taking possession of\r\nenemy territory by military force. Conquest is completed as soon as the\r\nterritory concerned is effectively[496] occupied. Now it is obvious that\r\nconquest of a part of enemy territory has nothing to do with\r\nsubjugation, because the enemy may well reconquer it. But even the\r\nconquest of the whole of the enemy territory need not necessarily\r\ninclude subjugation. For, first, in a war between more than two\r\nbelligerents the troops of one of them may evacuate their country and\r\njoin the army of allies, so that the armed contention is continued,\r\nalthough the territory of one of the allies is completely conquered.\r\nAgain, a belligerent, although he has annihilated the forces, conquered\r\nthe whole of the territory of his adversary, and thereby actually\r\nbrought the armed contention to an end,[497] may nevertheless not choose\r\nto exterminate the enemy State by annexing the conquered territory, but\r\nmay conclude a treaty of peace with the expelled or imprisoned head of\r\nthe defeated State, re-establish the latter's Government, and hand the\r\nwhole or a part of the conquered territory over to it. Subjugation takes\r\nplace only when a belligerent, after having annihilated the forces and\r\nconquered the territory of his adversary, destroys his existence by\r\nannexing the conquered territory. Subjugation may, therefore, correctly\r\nbe defined as _extermination in war of one belligerent by another\r\nthrough annexation_[498] _of the former's territory after conquest, the\r\nenemy forces having been annihilated_.[499]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 496: The conditions of effective occupation have been\r\ndiscussed above in § 167. Regarding subjugation as a mode of acquisition\r\nof territory, see above, vol. I. §§ 236-241.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 497: The continuation of guerilla war after the termination of\r\na real war is discussed above in § 60.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 498: That conquest alone is sufficient for the termination of\r\ncivil wars has been pointed out above, § 261, p. 323, note 1.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 499: It should be mentioned that a premature annexation can\r\nbecome valid through the occupation in question becoming soon afterwards\r\neffective. Thus, although the annexation of the South African Republic,\r\non September 1, 1900, was premature, it became valid through the\r\noccupation becoming effective in 1901. See above, § 167, p. 209, note\r\n1.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Subjugation a formal End of War.]\r\n\r\n§ 265. Although complete conquest, together with annihilation of the\r\nenemy forces, brings the armed contention, and thereby the war, actually\r\nto an end, the formal end of the war is thereby not yet realised, as\r\neverything depends upon the resolution of the victor regarding the fate\r\nof the vanquished State. If he be willing to re-establish the captive or\r\nexpelled head of the vanquished State, it is a treaty of peace concluded\r\nwith the latter which terminates the war. But if he desires to acquire\r\nthe whole of the conquered territory for himself, he annexes it, and\r\nthereby formally ends the war through subjugation. That the expelled\r\nhead of the vanquished State protests and keeps up his claims, matters\r\nas little eventually as protests on the part of neutral States. These\r\nprotests may be of political importance for the future, legally they are\r\nof no importance at all.\r\n\r\nHistory presents numerous instances of subjugation. Although no longer\r\nso frequent as in former times, subjugation is not at all of rare\r\noccurrence. Thus, modern Italy came into existence through the\r\nsubjugation by Sardinia in 1859 of the Two Sicilies, the Grand Dukedom\r\nof Tuscany, the Dukedoms of Parma and Modena, and in 1870 the Papal\r\nStates. Thus, further, Prussia subjugated in 1866 the Kingdom of\r\nHanover, the Dukedom of Nassau, the Electorate of Hesse-Cassel, and the\r\nFree Town of Frankfort-on-the-Main. And Great Britain annexed in 1900\r\nthe Orange Free State and the South African Republic.[500]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 500: Since Great Britain annexed these territories in 1900,\r\nthe agreement of 1902, regarding \"Terms of Surrender of the Boer Forces\r\nin the Field\"--see _Parliamentary Papers_, South Africa, 1902, Cd.\r\n1096--is not a treaty of peace, and the South African War came formally\r\nto an end through subjugation, although--see above, § 167, p. 209, note\r\n1--the proclamation of the annexation was somewhat premature. The\r\nagreement embodying the terms of surrender of the routed remnants of the\r\nBoer forces has, therefore, no internationally legal basis (see also\r\nbelow, § 274, p. 334, note 2). The case would be different if the\r\nBritish Government had really--as Sir Thomas Barclay asserts in _The Law\r\nQuarterly Review_, XXI. (1905), pp. 303 and 307--recognised the\r\nexistence of the Government of the South African Republic down to May\r\n31, 1902.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nTREATY OF PEACE\r\n\r\n  Grotius, III. c. 20--Vattel, IV. §§ 9-18--Phillimore, III. §§\r\n  513-516--Halleck, I. pp. 306-324--Taylor, §§ 590-592--Moore, VII.\r\n  § 1163--Wheaton, §§ 538-543--Bluntschli, §§ 703-707--Heffter, §\r\n  179--Kirchenheim in Holtzendorff, IV. pp. 794-804--Ullmann, §\r\n  198--Bonfils, Nos. 1696-1697, 1703-1705--Despagnet, Nos.\r\n  606-611--Rivier, II. pp. 443-453--Nys, III. pp. 719-734--Calvo, V.\r\n  §§ 3119-3136--Fiore, III.

Although occasionally war ends through simple cessation of\r\nhostilities, and although subjugation is not at all rare or irregular,\r\nthe most frequent end of war is a treaty of peace. Many publicists\r\ncorrectly call a treaty of peace the normal mode of terminating war. On\r\nthe one hand, simple cessation of hostilities is certainly an irregular\r\nmode. Subjugation, on the other hand, is in most cases either not\r\nwithin the scope of the intention of the victor or not realisable. And\r\nit is quite reasonable that a treaty of peace should be the normal end\r\nof war. States which are driven from disagreement to war will, sooner or\r\nlater, when the fortune of war has given its decision, be convinced that\r\nthe armed contention ought to be terminated. Thus a mutual understanding\r\nand agreement upon certain terms is the normal mode of ending the\r\ncontention. And it is a treaty of peace which embodies such\r\nunderstanding.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Peace Negotiations.]\r\n\r\n§ 267. However, as the outbreak of war interrupts all regular\r\nnon-hostile intercourse between belligerents, negotiations for peace are\r\noften difficult of initiation. Each party, although willing to\r\nnegotiate, may have strong reasons for not opening negotiations. Good\r\noffices and mediation on the part of neutrals, therefore, always are of\r\ngreat importance, as thereby negotiations are called into existence\r\nwhich otherwise might have been long delayed. But it must be emphasised\r\nthat neither formal nor informal peace negotiations do _ipso facto_\r\nbring hostilities to a standstill, although a partial or general\r\narmistice may be concluded for the purpose of such negotiations. The\r\nfact that peace negotiations are going on directly between belligerents\r\ndoes not create any non-hostile relations between them apart from those\r\nnegotiations themselves. Such negotiations can take place by the\r\nexchange of letters between the belligerent Governments, or through\r\nspecial negotiators who may meet on neutral territory or on the\r\nterritory of one of the belligerents. In case they meet on belligerent\r\nterritory, the enemy negotiators are inviolable and must be treated on\r\nthe same footing as bearers of flags of truce, if not as diplomatic\r\nenvoys. For it can happen that a belligerent receives an enemy\r\ndiplomatic envoy for the purpose of peace negotiations. Be that as it\r\nmay, negotiations, wherever taking place and by whomsoever conducted,\r\nmay always be broken off before an agreement is arrived at.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Preliminaries of Peace.]\r\n\r\n§ 268. Although ready to terminate the war through a treaty of peace,\r\nbelligerents are frequently not able to settle all the terms of peace at\r\nonce. In such cases hostilities are usually brought to an end through\r\nso-called preliminaries of peace, the definite treaty, which has to take\r\nthe place of the preliminaries, being concluded later on. Such\r\npreliminaries are a treaty in themselves, embodying an agreement of the\r\nparties regarding such terms of peace as are essential. Preliminaries\r\nare as binding as any other treaty, and therefore they need\r\nratification. Very often, but not necessarily, the definitive treaty of\r\npeace is concluded at a place other than that at which the preliminaries\r\nwere settled. Thus, the war between Austria, France, and Sardinia was\r\nended by the Preliminaries of Villafranca of July 11, 1859, yet the\r\ndefinitive treaty of peace was concluded at Zurich on November 10, 1859.\r\nThe war between Austria and Prussia was ended by the Preliminaries of\r\nNickolsburg of July 26, 1866, yet the definitive treaty of peace was\r\nconcluded at Prague on August 23. In the Franco-German War the\r\nPreliminaries of Versailles of February 26, 1871, were the precursor of\r\nthe definitive treaty of peace concluded at Frankfort on May 10,\r\n1871.[501]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 501: No preliminaries of peace were agreed upon at the end of\r\nthe Russo-Japanese war. After negotiations at Portsmouth (New Hampshire)\r\nhad led to a final understanding on August 29, 1905, the treaty of peace\r\nwas signed on September 5, and ratified on October 16.]\r\n\r\nThe purpose for which preliminaries of peace are agreed upon makes it\r\nobvious that such essential terms of peace as are stipulated by the\r\nPreliminaries are the basis of the definitive treaty of peace. It may\r\nhappen, however, that neutral States protest for the purpose of\r\npreventing this. Thus, when the war between Russia and Turkey had been\r\nended through the Preliminaries of San Stefano of March 3, 1878, Great\r\nBritain protested, a Congress met at Berlin, and Russia had to be\r\ncontent with less favourable terms of peace than those stipulated at San\r\nStefano.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Form and Parts of Peace Treaties.]\r\n\r\n§ 269. International Law does not contain any rules regarding the form\r\nof peace treaties; they may, therefore, be concluded verbally or in\r\nwriting. But the importance of the matter makes the parties always\r\nconclude a treaty of peace in writing, and there is no instance of a\r\nverbally concluded treaty of peace.\r\n\r\nAccording to the different points stipulated, it is usual to distinguish\r\ndifferent parts within a peace treaty. Besides the preamble, there are\r\ngeneral, special, and separate articles. General articles are those\r\nwhich stipulate such points as are to be agreed upon in every treaty of\r\npeace, as the date of termination of hostilities, the release of\r\nprisoners of war, and the like. Special articles are those which\r\nstipulate the special terms of the agreement of peace in question.\r\nSeparate articles are those which stipulate points with regard to the\r\nexecution of the general and special articles, or which contain\r\nreservations and other special remarks of the parties. Sometimes\r\n_additional_ articles occur. Such are stipulations agreed upon in a\r\nspecial treaty following the treaty of peace and comprising stipulations\r\nregarding such points as have not been mentioned in the treaty of peace.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Competence to conclude Peace.]\r\n\r\n§ 270. As the treaty-making Power is according to the Law of Nations in\r\nthe hands of the head[502] of the State, it is he who is competent to\r\nconclude peace. But just as constitutional restrictions imposed upon\r\nheads of States regarding their general power of concluding\r\ntreaties[503] are of importance for International Law, so constitutional\r\nrestrictions imposed upon heads of States regarding their competence to\r\nmake peace are of similar importance. And, therefore, such treaties of\r\npeace concluded by heads of States as violate constitutional\r\nrestrictions are not binding upon the States concerned, because the\r\nheads have exceeded their powers. The Constitutions of the several\r\nStates settle the matter differently, and it is not at all necessary\r\nthat the power of declaring war and that of making peace should be\r\nvested by a Constitution in the same hands. In Great Britain the power\r\nof the Crown to declare war and to make peace is indeed unrestricted.\r\nBut in the German Empire, for instance, it is different; for whereas the\r\nEmperor, the case of an attack on German territory excepted, may declare\r\nwar only with the consent of the Bundesrath, his power of making peace\r\nis unrestricted.[504]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 502: See above, vol. I. § 495.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 503: See above, vol. I. § 497.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 504: See more examples in Rivier, II. p. 445.]\r\n\r\nThe controverted question as to whether the head of a State who is a\r\nprisoner of war is competent to make peace ought to be answered in the\r\nnegative. The reason is that the head of a constitutional State,\r\nalthough he does not by becoming a prisoner of war lose his position, he\r\nnevertheless thereby loses the power of exercising the rights connected\r\nwith his position.[505]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 505: See Vattel, IV. § 13.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Date of Peace.]\r\n\r\n§ 271. Unless the treaty provides otherwise, peace commences with the\r\nsigning of the peace treaty. Should the latter not be ratified,\r\nhostilities may be recommenced, and the unratified peace treaty is\r\nconsidered as an armistice. Sometimes, however, the peace treaty fixes a\r\nfuture date for the commencement of peace, stipulating that hostilities\r\nmust cease on a certain future day. This is the case when war is waged\r\nin several or widely separated parts of the world, and when, therefore,\r\nit is impossible at once to inform the opposing forces of the conclusion\r\nof peace.[506] It may even occur that different dates are stipulated\r\nfor the termination of hostilities in different parts of the world.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 506: The ending of the Russo-Japanese war was quite peculiar.\r\nAlthough the treaty of peace was signed on September 5, 1905, the\r\nagreement concerning an armistice pending ratification of the peace\r\ntreaty was not signed until September 14, and hostilities went on till\r\nSeptember 16.]\r\n\r\nThe question has arisen as to whether, in case a peace treaty provides a\r\nfuture date for the termination of hostilities in distant parts, and in\r\ncase the forces in these parts hear of the conclusion of peace before\r\nsuch date, they must abstain at once from further hostilities. Most\r\npublicists correctly answer this question in the affirmative. But the\r\nFrench Prize Courts in 1801 condemned as a good prize the English vessel\r\n_Swineherd_ which was captured by the French privateer _Bellona_ in the\r\nIndian Seas within the period of five months fixed by the Peace of\r\nAmiens for the termination of hostilities in these seas.[507]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 507: The details of this case are given by Hall, § 199; see\r\nalso Phillimore, III. § 521.]\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nEFFECTS OF TREATY OF PEACE\r\n\r\n  Grotius, III. c. 20--Vattel, IV. §§ 19-23--Hall, §§\r\n  198-202--Lawrence, § 218--Phillimore, III. §§ 518-528--Halleck, I.\r\n  pp. 312-324--Taylor, §§ 581-583--Wheaton, §§ 544-547--Bluntschli,\r\n  §§ 708-723--Heffter, §§ 180-183, 184A--Kirchenheim in\r\n  Holtzendorff, IV. pp. 804-817--Ullmann, § 199--Bonfils, Nos.\r\n  1698-1702--Despagnet, No. 607--Rivier, II. pp. 454-461--Calvo, V.\r\n  §§ 3137-3163--Fiore, III.

The chief and general effect of a peace treaty is restoration of\r\nthe condition of peace between the former belligerents. As soon as the\r\ntreaty is ratified, all rights and duties which exist in time of peace\r\nbetween the members of the family of nations are _ipso facto_ and at\r\nonce revived between the former belligerents.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, all acts legitimate in warfare cease to be legitimate.\r\nNeither contributions and requisitions, nor attacks on members of the\r\narmed forces or on fortresses, nor capture of ships, nor occupation of\r\nterritory are any longer lawful. If forces, ignorant of the conclusion\r\nof peace, commit such hostile acts, the condition of things at the time\r\npeace was concluded must as far as possible be restored.[508] Thus,\r\nships captured must be set free, territory occupied must be evacuated,\r\nmembers of armed forces taken prisoners must be liberated, contributions\r\nimposed and paid must be repaid.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 508: The _Mentor_ (1799), 1 C. Rob. 179. Matters are, of\r\ncourse, different in case a future date--see above, § 271--is stipulated\r\nfor the termination of hostilities.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, all peaceful intercourse between the former\r\nbelligerents as well as between their subjects is resumed as before the\r\nwar. Thus diplomatic intercourse is restored, and consular officers\r\nrecommence their duties.[509]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 509: The assertion of many writers, that such contracts\r\nbetween subjects of belligerents as have been suspended by the outbreak\r\nof war revive _ipso facto_ by the conclusion of peace is not the outcome\r\nof a rule of International Law. But just as Municipal Law may suspend\r\nsuch contracts _ipso facto_ by the outbreak of war, so it may revive\r\nthem _ipso facto_ by the conclusion of peace. See above, § 101.]\r\n\r\nAttention must be drawn to the fact that the condition of peace created\r\nby a peace treaty is legally final in so far as the order of things set\r\nup and stipulated by the treaty of peace is the settled basis of future\r\nrelations between the parties, however contentious the matters concerned\r\nmay have been before the outbreak of war. In concluding peace the\r\nparties expressly or implicitly declare that they have come to an\r\nunderstanding regarding such settled matters. They may indeed make war\r\nagainst each other in future on other grounds, but they are legally\r\nbound not to go to war over such matters as have been settled by a\r\nprevious treaty of peace. That the practice of States does not always\r\ncomply with this rule is a well-known fact which, although it discredits\r\nthis rule, cannot shake its theoretical validity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Principle of _Uti Possidetis_.]\r\n\r\n§ 273. Unless the parties stipulate otherwise, the effect of a treaty of\r\npeace is that conditions remain as at the conclusion of peace. Thus, all\r\nmoveable State property, as munitions, provisions, arms, money, horses,\r\nmeans of transport, and the like, seized by an invading belligerent\r\nremain his property, as likewise do the fruits of immoveable property\r\nseized by him. Thus further, if nothing is stipulated regarding\r\nconquered territory, it remains in the hands of the possessor, who may\r\nannex it. But it is nowadays usual, although not at all legally\r\nnecessary, for the conqueror desirous of retaining conquered territory\r\nto stipulate cession of such territory in the treaty of peace.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Amnesty.]\r\n\r\n§ 274. Since a treaty of peace is considered a final settlement of the\r\nwar, one of the effects of every peace treaty is the so-called\r\namnesty--that is, an immunity for all wrongful acts done by the\r\nbelligerents themselves, the members of their forces, and their subjects\r\nduring the war, and due to political motives.[510] It is usual, but not\r\nat all necessary, to insert an amnesty clause in a treaty of peace.\r\nSo-called war crimes[511] which were not punished before the conclusion\r\nof peace may no longer be punished after its conclusion. Individuals\r\nwho have committed such war crimes and have been arrested for them must\r\nbe liberated.[512] International delinquencies committed intentionally\r\nby belligerents through violation of the rules of legitimate warfare are\r\nconsidered condoned. Formerly even claims for reparation of damages\r\ncaused by such acts could not be raised after the conclusion of peace,\r\nunless the contrary was expressly stipulated, but the matter is\r\ndifferent now in accordance with article 3 of Convention IV. of the\r\nSecond Peace Conference.[513] On the other hand, the amnesty has nothing\r\nto do with ordinary crimes or with debts incurred during war. A prisoner\r\nof war who commits murder during captivity may be tried and punished\r\nafter the conclusion of peace, just as a prisoner who runs into debt\r\nduring captivity may be sued after the conclusion of peace, or an action\r\nmay be brought on ransom bills after peace has been restored.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 510: Stress must be laid on the fact that this immunity is\r\nonly effective in regard to the other party to the war. For instance,\r\nthe occupant of enemy territory may not, after the conclusion of peace,\r\npunish war criminals. Nothing, however, prevents a belligerent from\r\npunishing members of his own forces or any of his own subjects who\r\nduring war committed violations of the laws of war, _e.g._ killed\r\nwounded enemy soldiers and the like.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 511: See above, §§ 251-257. Clause 4 of the \"Terms of\r\nSurrender of the Boer Forces in the Field\"--see _Parliamentary Papers_,\r\nSouth Africa, 1902, Cd. 1096--seems to contradict this assertion, as it\r\nexpressly excludes from the amnesty \"certain acts, contrary to usages of\r\nwar, which have been notified by the Commander-in-Chief to the Boer\r\nGenerals, and which shall be tried by court-martial immediately after\r\nthe close of hostilities.\" But it will be remembered--see above, § 265,\r\np. 327, note 1--that the agreement embodying these terms of surrender\r\ndoes not bear the character of a treaty of peace, the Boer War having\r\nbeen terminated through subjugation.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 512: This applies to such individuals only as have not yet\r\nbeen convicted. Those who are undergoing a term of imprisonment need not\r\nbe liberated at the conclusion of peace; see above, § 257.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 513: See above, § 259_a_.]\r\n\r\nBut it is important to remember here again that the amnesty grants\r\nimmunity only for wrongful acts done by the subjects of one belligerent\r\nagainst the other. Such wrongful acts as have been committed by the\r\nsubjects of a belligerent against their own Government are not covered\r\nby the amnesty. Therefore treason, desertion, and the like committed\r\nduring the war by his own subjects may be punished by a belligerent\r\nafter the conclusion of peace, unless the contrary has been expressly\r\nstipulated in the treaty of peace.[514]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 514: Thus Russia stipulated by article 17 of the Preliminaries\r\nof San Stefano, in 1878--see Martens, _N.R.G._ 2nd Ser. III. p.\r\n252--that Turkey must accord an amnesty to such of her own subjects as\r\nhad compromised themselves during the war.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Release of Prisoners of War.]\r\n\r\n§ 275. A very important effect of a treaty of peace is termination of\r\nthe captivity of prisoners of war.[515] This, however, does not mean\r\nthat with the conclusion of peace all prisoners of war must at once be\r\nreleased. It only means--to use the words of article 20 of the Hague\r\nRegulations--that \"After the conclusion of peace, the repatriation of\r\nprisoners of war shall take place as speedily as possible.\" The instant\r\nrelease of prisoners at the very place where they were detained, would\r\nbe inconvenient not only for the State which kept them in captivity, but\r\nalso for themselves, as in most cases they would not possess means to\r\npay for their journey home. Therefore, although with the conclusion of\r\npeace they cease to be captives in the technical sense of the term,\r\nprisoners of war remain as a body under military discipline until they\r\nare brought to the frontier and handed over to their Government. That\r\nprisoners of war may be detained after the conclusion of peace until\r\nthey have paid debts incurred during captivity seems to be an almost\r\ngenerally[516] recognised rule. But it is controversial whether such\r\nprisoners of war may be detained as are undergoing a term of\r\nimprisonment imposed upon them for offences against discipline. After\r\nthe Franco-German War in 1871 Germany detained such prisoners,[517]\r\nwhereas Japan after the Russo-Japanese War in 1905 released them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 515: See above, § 132.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 516: See, however, Pradier-Fodéré, VII. No. 2839, who objects\r\nto it.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 517: See Pradier-Fodéré, VII. No. 2840; Beinhauer, _Die\r\nKriegsgefangenschaft_ (1910), p. 79; Payrat, _Le prisonnier de Guerre_\r\n(1910), pp. 364-370.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Revival of Treaties.]\r\n\r\n§ 276. The question how far a peace treaty has the effect of reviving\r\ntreaties concluded between the parties before the outbreak of war is\r\nmuch controverted. The answer depends upon the other question, how far\r\nthe outbreak of war cancels existing treaties between belligerents.[518]\r\nThere can be no doubt that all such treaties as have been cancelled by\r\nthe outbreak of war do not revive. On the other hand, there can likewise\r\nbe no doubt that such treaties as have only become suspended by the\r\noutbreak of war do revive. But no certainty or unanimity exists\r\nregarding such treaties as do not belong to the above two classes, and\r\nit must, therefore, be emphasised that no rule of International Law\r\nexists concerning these treaties. It is for the parties to make such\r\nspecial stipulations in the peace treaty as will settle the matter.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 518: See the very detailed discussion of the question in\r\nPhillimore, III. §§ 529-538; see also above, § 99.]\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nPERFORMANCE OF TREATY OF PEACE\r\n\r\n  Grotius, III. c. 20--Vattel, IV. §§ 24-34--Phillimore, III. §\r\n  597--Halleck, I. pp. 322-324--Taylor, §§ 593-594--Wheaton, §§\r\n  548-550--Bluntschli, §§ 724-726--Heffter, § 184--Kirchenheim in\r\n  Holtzendorff, IV. pp. 817-822--Ullmann, § 199--Bonfils, Nos.\r\n  1706-1709--Despagnet, Nos. 612 and 613--Rivier, II. pp.\r\n  459-461--Calvo, V. §§ 3164-3168--Fiore, III.

The general rule, that treaties must be performed in good faith,\r\napplies to peace treaties as well as to others. The great importance,\r\nhowever, of a treaty of peace and its special circumstances and\r\nconditions make it necessary to draw attention to some points connected\r\nwith the performance of treaties of peace. Occupied territory may have\r\nto be evacuated, a war indemnity to be paid in cash, boundary lines of\r\nceded territory may have to be drawn, and many other tasks performed.\r\nThese tasks often necessitate the conclusion of numerous treaties for\r\nthe purpose of performing details of the peace treaty concerned, and the\r\nappointment of commissioners who meet in conference to inquire into\r\ndetails and prepare a compromise. Difficulties may arise in regard to\r\nthe interpretation[519] of certain stipulations of the peace treaty\r\nwhich arbitration will settle if the parties cannot agree.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 519: See above, vol. I. §§ 553-554.] Arrangements may have to\r\nbe made for the case in which a part or the whole of the territory\r\noccupied during the war remains, according to the peace treaty, for some\r\nperiod under military occupation, such occupation to serve as a means of\r\nsecuring the performance of the peace treaty.[520] One can form an idea\r\nof the numerous points of importance to be dealt with during the\r\nperformance of a treaty of peace if one takes into consideration the\r\nfact that, after the Franco-German War was terminated in 1871 by the\r\nPeace of Frankfort, more than a hundred Conventions were successively\r\nconcluded between the parties for the purpose of carrying out this\r\ntreaty of peace.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 520: See above, vol. I. § 527.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Breach of Treaty of Peace.]\r\n\r\n§ 278. Just as is the performance, so is the breach of peace treaties of\r\ngreat importance. A peace treaty can be violated in its entirety or in\r\none of its stipulations only. Violation by one of the parties does not\r\n_ipso facto_ cancel the treaty, but the other party may cancel it on the\r\nground of violation. Just as in connection with violation of treaties in\r\ngeneral, so in violations of treaties of peace, some publicists maintain\r\nthat a distinction must be drawn between essential and non-essential\r\nstipulations, and that violation of essential stipulations only creates\r\na right of cancelling the treaty of peace. It has been shown above, Vol.\r\nI. § 547, that the majority of publicists rightly oppose the\r\ndistinction.\r\n\r\nBut a distinction must be made between violation during the period in\r\nwhich the conditions of the peace treaty have to be fulfilled, and\r\nviolation after such period. In the first case, the other party may at\r\nonce recommence hostilities, the war being considered not to have\r\nterminated through the violated peace treaty. The second case, which\r\nmight happen soon or several years after the period for the fulfilment\r\nof the peace conditions, is in no way different from violation of any\r\ntreaty in general. And if a party cancels the peace treaty and wages war\r\nagainst the offender who violated it, this war is a new war, and in no\r\nway a continuation of the previous war which was terminated by the\r\nviolated treaty of peace. It must, however, be specially observed that,\r\njust as in case of violation of a treaty in general, so in case of\r\nviolation of a peace treaty, the offended party who wants to cancel the\r\ntreaty on the ground of its violation must do this in reasonable time\r\nafter the violation has taken place, otherwise the treaty remains valid,\r\nor at least the non-violated parts of it. A mere protest neither\r\nconstitutes a cancellation nor reserves the right of cancellation.[521]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 521: See above, vol. I. § 547.]\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nPOSTLIMINIUM\r\n\r\n  Grotius, III. c. 9--Bynkershoek, _Quaest. jur. publ._ I. c. 15 and\r\n  16--Vattel, III. §§ 204-222--Hall, §§ 162-166--Manning, pp.\r\n  190-195--Phillimore, III. §§ 568-590--Halleck, II. pp.\r\n  500-526--Taylor, § 595--Wheaton, § 398--Bluntschli, §§\r\n  727-741--Heffter, §§ 188-192--Kirchenheim in Holtzendorff, IV. pp.\r\n  822-836--Bonfils, No. 1710--Despagnet, No. 611--Nys, III. pp.\r\n  738-739--Rivier, II. pp. 314-316--Calvo, V. §§ 3169-3226--Fiore,\r\n  III. Nos. 1706-1712--Martens, II. § 128--Pillet, p. 377.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Conception of Postliminium.]\r\n\r\n§ 279. The term \"postliminium\" is originally one of Roman Law derived\r\nfrom _post_ and _limen_ (_i.e._ boundary). According to Roman Law the\r\nrelations of Rome with a foreign State depended upon the fact whether or\r\nnot a treaty of friendship[522] existed. If such a treaty was not in\r\nexistence, Romans entering the foreign State concerned could be\r\nenslaved, and Roman goods taken there could be appropriated. Now, _jus\r\npostliminii_ denoted the rule, firstly, that such an enslaved Roman,\r\nshould he ever return into the territory of the Roman Empire, became\r\n_ipso facto_ a Roman citizen again with all the rights he possessed\r\nprevious to his capture, and, secondly, that Roman property,\r\nappropriated after entry into the territory of a foreign State, should\r\nat once upon being taken back into the territory of the Roman Empire\r\n_ipso facto_ revert to its former Roman owner. Modern International and\r\nMunicipal Law have adopted the term for the purpose of indicating the\r\nfact that territory, individuals, and property, after having come in\r\ntime of war under the sway of the enemy, return either during the war or\r\nwith the end of the war under the sway of their original Sovereign. This\r\ncan occur in different ways. An occupied territory can voluntarily be\r\nevacuated by the enemy and then at once be reoccupied by the owner. Or\r\nit can be reconquered by the legitimate Sovereign. Or it can be\r\nreconquered by a third party and restored to its legitimate owner.\r\nConquered territory can also be freed through a successful levy _en\r\nmasse_. Property seized by the enemy can be retaken, but it can also be\r\nabandoned by the enemy and subsequently revert to the belligerent from\r\nwhom it was taken. And, further, conquered territory can in consequence\r\nof a treaty of peace be restored to its legitimate Sovereign. In all\r\ncases concerned, the question has to be answered what legal effects the\r\npostliminium has in regard to the territory, the individuals thereon, or\r\nthe property concerned.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 522: See above, vol. I. § 40.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Postliminium according to International Law, in\r\ncontradistinction to Postliminium according to Municipal Law.]\r\n\r\n§ 280. Most writers confound the effects of postliminium according to\r\nMunicipal Law with those according to International Law. For instance:\r\nwhether a private ship which is recaptured reverts _ipso facto_ to its\r\nformer owner;[523] whether the former laws of a reconquered State revive\r\n_ipso facto_ by the reconquest; whether sentences passed on criminals\r\nduring the time of an occupation by the enemy should be annulled--these\r\nand many similar questions treated in books on International Law have\r\nnothing at all to do with International Law, but have to be answered\r\nexclusively by the Municipal Law of the respective States. International\r\nLaw can deal only with such effects of postliminium as are\r\ninternational. These international effects of postliminium may be\r\ngrouped under the following heads: revival of the former condition of\r\nthings, validity of legitimate acts, invalidity of illegitimate acts.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 523: See above, § 196.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Revival of the Former Condition of Things.]\r\n\r\n§ 281. Although a territory and the individuals thereon come through\r\nmilitary occupation in war under the actual sway of the enemy, neither\r\nsuch territory nor such individuals, according to the rules of\r\nInternational Law of our times, fall under the sovereignty of the\r\ninvader. They rather remain, if not acquired by the conqueror through\r\nsubjugation, under the sovereignty of the other belligerent, although\r\nthe latter is in fact prevented from exercising his supremacy over them.\r\nNow, the moment the invader voluntarily evacuates such territory, or is\r\ndriven away by a levy _en masse_, or by troops of the other belligerent\r\nor of his ally, the former condition of things _ipso facto_ revives; the\r\nterritory and individuals concerned being at once, so far as\r\nInternational Law is concerned, considered to be again under the sway of\r\ntheir legitimate Sovereign. For all events of international importance\r\ntaking place on such territory the legitimate Sovereign is again\r\nresponsible towards third States, whereas during the time of occupation\r\nthe occupant was responsible for such events.\r\n\r\nBut it must be specially observed that the case in which the occupant of\r\na territory is driven out of it by the forces of a third State not\r\nallied with the legitimate Sovereign of such territory is not a case of\r\npostliminium, and that consequently the former state of things does not\r\nrevive, unless the new occupant hands the territory over to the\r\nlegitimate Sovereign. If this is not done, the military occupation of\r\nthe new occupant takes the place of that of the previous occupant.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Validity of Legitimate Acts.]\r\n\r\n§ 282. Postliminium has no effect upon such acts of the former military\r\noccupant connected with the occupied territory and the individuals and\r\nproperty thereon as were legitimate acts of warfare. On the contrary,\r\nthe State into whose possession such territory has reverted must\r\nrecognise all such legitimate acts of the former occupant, and the\r\nlatter has by International Law a right to demand such recognition.\r\nTherefore, if the occupant has collected the ordinary taxes, has sold\r\nthe ordinary fruits of immoveable property, has disposed of such\r\nmoveable state property as he was competent to appropriate, or has\r\nperformed other acts in conformity with the laws of war, this may not be\r\nignored by the legitimate Sovereign after he has again taken possession\r\nof the territory.\r\n\r\nHowever, only those consequences of such acts must be recognised which\r\nhave occurred during the occupation. A case which illustrates this\r\nhappened after the Franco-German War. In October 1870, during occupation\r\nby German troops of the _Départements de la Meuse_ and _de la Meurthe_,\r\na Berlin firm entered into a contract with the German Government to fell\r\n15,000 oak trees in the State forests of these _départements_, paying in\r\nadvance £2250. The Berlin firm sold the contract rights to others, who\r\nfelled 9000 trees and sold, in March 1871, their right to fell the\r\nremaining 6000 trees to a third party. The last-named felled a part of\r\nthese trees during the German occupation, but, when the French\r\nGovernment again took possession of the territory concerned, the\r\ncontractors were without indemnity prevented from further felling of\r\ntrees.[524] The question whether the Germans had a right at all to enter\r\ninto the contract is doubtful. But even if they had such right, it\r\ncovered the felling of trees during their occupation only, and not\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 524: The Protocol of Signature added to the Additional\r\nConvention to the Peace Treaty of Frankfort, signed on December 11,\r\n1871--see Martens, _N.R.G._ XX. p. 868--comprises a declaration stating\r\nthe fact that the French Government does not recognise any liability to\r\npay indemnities to the contractors concerned.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Invalidity of Illegitimate Acts.]\r\n\r\n§ 283. If the occupant has performed acts which are not legitimate acts\r\nof warfare, postliminium makes their invalidity apparent. Therefore, if\r\nthe occupant has sold immoveable State property, such property may\r\nafterwards be claimed from the acquirer, whoever he is, without any\r\nindemnity. If he has given office to individuals, they may afterwards be\r\ndismissed. If he has appropriated and sold such private or public\r\nproperty as may not legitimately be appropriated by a military occupant,\r\nit may afterwards be claimed from the acquirer without payment of\r\ndamages.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: No Postliminium after Interregnum.]\r\n\r\n§ 284. Cases of postliminium occur only when a conquered territory comes\r\neither during or at the end of the war again into the possession of the\r\nlegitimate Sovereign. No case of postliminium arises when a territory,\r\nceded to the enemy by the treaty of peace or conquered and annexed\r\nwithout cession at the end of a war which was terminated through simple\r\ncessation of hostilities,[525] later on reverts to its former owner\r\nState, or when the whole of the territory of a State which was conquered\r\nand subjugated regains its liberty and becomes again the territory of an\r\nindependent State. Such territory has actually been under the\r\nsovereignty of the conqueror; the period between the conquest and the\r\nrevival of the previous condition of things was not one of mere military\r\noccupation during war, but one of interregnum during time of peace, and\r\ntherefore the revival of the former condition of things is not a case\r\nof postliminium. An illustrative instance of this is furnished by the\r\ncase of the domains of the Electorate of Hesse-Cassel.[526] This\r\nhitherto independent State was subjugated in 1806 by Napoleon and became\r\nin 1807 part of the Kingdom of Westphalia constituted by Napoleon for\r\nhis brother Jerome, who governed it up to the end of 1813, when, with\r\nthe downfall of Napoleon, the Kingdom of Westphalia fell to pieces and\r\nthe former Elector of Hesse-Cassel was reinstated. Jerome had during his\r\nreign sold many of the domains of Hesse-Cassel. The Elector, however, on\r\nhis return, did not recognise these contracts, but deprived the owners\r\nof their property without indemnification, maintaining that a case of\r\npostliminium had arisen, and that Jerome had no right to sell the\r\ndomains. The Courts of the Electorate pronounced against the Elector,\r\ndenying that a case of postliminium had arisen, since Jerome, although a\r\nusurper, had been King of Westphalia during an interregnum, and since\r\nthe sale of the domains was therefore no wrongful act. But the Elector,\r\nwho was absolute in the Electorate, did not comply with the verdict of\r\nhis own courts, and the Vienna Congress, which was approached in the\r\nmatter by the unfortunate proprietors of the domains, refused its\r\nintervention, although Prussia strongly took their part. It is generally\r\nrecognised by all writers on International Law that this case was not\r\none of postliminium, and the attitude of the Elector cannot therefore be\r\ndefended by appeal to International Law.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 525: See above, § 263.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 526: See Phillimore, III. §§ 568-574, and the literature there\r\nquoted.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III\r\n\r\nNEUTRALITY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nON NEUTRALITY IN GENERAL\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nDEVELOPMENT OF THE INSTITUTION OF NEUTRALITY\r\n\r\n  Hall, §§ 208-214--Lawrence, § 223--Westlake, II. pp.\r\n  169-177--Phillimore, III. §§ 161-226--Twiss, II. §§\r\n  208-212--Taylor, §§ 596-613--Walker, _History_, pp. 195-203, and\r\n  _Science_, pp. 374-385--Geffcken in Holtzendorff, IV. pp.\r\n  614-634--Ullmann, § 190--Bonfils, Nos. 1494-1521--Despagnet, No.\r\n  687--Rivier, II. pp. 370-375--Nys, III. pp. 558-567--Calvo, IV. §§\r\n  2494-2591--Fiore, III.

Since in antiquity there was no notion of an International\r\nLaw,[527] it is not to be expected that neutrality as a legal\r\ninstitution should have existed among the nations of old. Neutrality did\r\nnot exist even in practice, for belligerents never recognised an\r\nattitude of impartiality on the part of other States. If war broke out\r\nbetween two nations, third parties had to choose between the\r\nbelligerents and become allies or enemies of one or other. This does not\r\nmean that third parties had actually to take part in the fighting.\r\nNothing of the kind was the case. But they had, if necessary, to render\r\nassistance; for example, to allow the passage of belligerent forces\r\nthrough their country, to supply provisions and the like to the party\r\nthey favoured, and to deny all such assistance to the enemy. Several\r\ninstances are known of efforts[528] on the part of third parties to take\r\nup an attitude of impartiality, but belligerents never recognised such\r\nimpartiality.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 527: See above, vol. I. § 37.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 528: See Geffcken in Holtzendorff, IV. pp. 614-615.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Neutrality during the Middle Ages.]\r\n\r\n§ 286. During the Middle Ages matters changed in so far only as, in the\r\nlatter part of this period, belligerents did not exactly force third\r\nparties to a choice; but legal duties and rights connected with\r\nneutrality did not exist. A State could maintain that it was no party to\r\na war, although it furnished one of the belligerents with money, troops,\r\nand other kinds of assistance. To prevent such assistance, which was in\r\nno way considered illegal, treaties were frequently concluded, during\r\nthe latter part of the Middle Ages, for the purpose of specially\r\nstipulating that the parties were not to assist each other's enemies in\r\nany way during time of war, and were to prevent their subjects from\r\nrendering such assistance. Through the influence of such treaties the\r\ndifference between a really and feigned impartial attitude of third\r\nStates during war became recognised, and neutrality, as an institution\r\nof International Law, gradually developed during the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nOf great importance was the fact that the Swiss Confederation, in\r\ncontradistinction to her policy during former times, made it a matter of\r\npolicy from the end of the sixteenth century always to remain neutral\r\nduring wars between other States. Although this former neutrality of the\r\nSwiss can in no way be compared with modern neutrality, since Swiss\r\nmercenaries for centuries afterwards fought in all European wars, the\r\nSwiss Government itself succeeded in each instance in taking up and\r\npreserving such an attitude of impartiality as complied with the current\r\nrules of neutrality.\r\n\r\nIt should be mentioned that the collection of rules and customs\r\nregarding Maritime Law which goes under the name of _Consolato del Mare_\r\nmade its appearance about the middle of the fourteenth century. One of\r\nthe rules there laid down, that in time of war enemy goods on neutral\r\nvessels may be confiscated, but that, on the other hand, neutral goods\r\non enemy vessels must be restored, became of great importance, since\r\nGreat Britain acted accordingly from the beginning of the eighteenth\r\ncentury until the outbreak of the Crimean War in 1854.[529]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 529: See above, § 176.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Neutrality during the Seventeenth Century.]\r\n\r\n§ 287. At the time of Grotius, neutrality was recognised as an\r\ninstitution of International Law, although such institution was in its\r\ninfancy only and needed a long time to reach its present range. Grotius\r\ndid not know, or at any rate did not make use of, the term\r\nneutrality.[530] He treats neutrality in the very short seventeenth\r\nchapter of the Third Book on the Law of War and Peace, under the head\r\n_De his, qui in bello medii sunt_, and establishes in § 3 two doubtful\r\nrules only. The first is that neutrals shall do nothing which may\r\nstrengthen a belligerent whose cause is unjust, or which may hinder the\r\nmovements of a belligerent whose cause is just. The second rule is that\r\nin a war in which it is doubtful whose cause is just, neutrals shall\r\ntreat both belligerents alike, in permitting the passage of troops, in\r\nsupplying provisions for the troops, and in not rendering assistance to\r\npersons besieged.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 530: That the term was known at the time of Grotius may be\r\ninferred from the fact that Neumayr de Ramsla in 1620 published his work\r\n_Von der Neutralität und Assistenz ... in Kriegszeiten_; see Nys in\r\n_R.I._ XVII. (1885), p. 78.]\r\n\r\nThe treatment of neutrality by Grotius shows, on the one hand, that\r\napart from the recognition of the fact that third parties could remain\r\nneutral, not many rules regarding the duties of neutrals existed, and,\r\non the other hand, that the granting of passage to troops of\r\nbelligerents and the supply of provisions to them was not considered\r\nillegal. And the practice of the seventeenth century furnishes numerous\r\ninstances of the fact that neutrality was not really an attitude of\r\nimpartiality, and that belligerents did not respect the territories of\r\nneutral States. Thus, although Charles I. remained neutral, the Marquis\r\nof Hamilton and six thousand British soldiers were fighting in 1631\r\nunder Gustavus Adolphus. \"In 1626 the English captured a French ship in\r\nDutch waters. In 1631 the Spaniards attacked the Dutch in a Danish port;\r\nin 1639 the Dutch were in turn the aggressors, and attacked the Spanish\r\nFleet in English waters; again, in 1666 they captured English vessels in\r\nthe Elbe...; in 1665 an English fleet endeavoured to seize the Dutch\r\nEast India Squadron in the harbour of Bergen, but were beaten off with\r\nthe help of the forts; finally, in 1693, the French attempted to cut\r\nsome Dutch ships out of Lisbon, and on being prevented by the guns of\r\nthe place from carrying them off, burnt them in the river.\"[531]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 531: See Hall, § 209, p. 604.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Progress of Neutrality during the Eighteenth Century.]\r\n\r\n§ 288. It was not until the eighteenth century that theory and practice\r\nagreed upon the duty of neutrals to remain impartial, and the duty of\r\nbelligerents to respect the territories of neutrals. Bynkershoek and\r\nVattel formulated adequate conceptions of neutrality. Bynkershoek[532]\r\ndoes not use the term \"neutrality,\" but calls neutrals _non hostes_, and\r\nhe describes them as those who are of neither party--_qui neutrarum\r\npartium sunt_--in a war, and who do not, in accordance with a treaty,\r\ngive assistance to either party. Vattel (III. § 103), on the other hand,\r\nmakes use of the term \"neutrality,\" and gives the following\r\ndefinition:--\"Neutral nations, during a war, are those who take no one's\r\npart, remaining friends common to both parties, and not favouring the\r\narmies of one of them to the prejudice of the other.\" But although\r\nVattel's book appeared in 1758, twenty-one years after that of\r\nBynkershoek, his doctrines are in some ways less advanced than those of\r\nBynkershoek. The latter, in contradistinction to Grotius, maintained\r\nthat neutrals had nothing to do with the question as to which party to a\r\nwar had a just cause; that neutrals, being friends to both parties, have\r\nnot to sit as judges between these parties, and, consequently, must not\r\ngive or deny to one or other party more or less in accordance with their\r\nconviction as to the justice or injustice of the cause of each. Vattel,\r\nhowever, teaches (III. § 135) that a neutral, although he may generally\r\nallow the passage of troops of the belligerents through his territory,\r\nmay refuse this passage to such belligerent as is making war for an\r\nunjust cause.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 532: _Quaest. jur. publ._ I. c. 9.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the theory and practice of the eighteenth century agreed upon\r\nthe duty of neutrals to remain impartial, the impartiality demanded was\r\nnot at all a strict one. For, firstly, throughout the greater part of\r\nthe century a State was considered not to violate neutrality in case it\r\nfurnished one of the belligerents with such limited assistance as it had\r\npreviously promised by treaty.[533] In this way troops could be supplied\r\nby a neutral to a belligerent, and passage through neutral territory\r\ncould be granted to his forces. And, secondly, the possibility existed\r\nfor either belligerent to make use of the resources of neutrals. It was\r\nnot considered a breach of neutrality on the part of a State to allow\r\none or both belligerents to levy troops on its territory, or to grant\r\nLetters of Marque to vessels belonging to its commercial fleet. During\r\nthe second half of the eighteenth century, theory and practice became\r\naware of the fact that neutrality was not consistent with these and\r\nother indulgences. But this only led to the distinction between\r\nneutrality in the strict sense of the term and an imperfect neutrality.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 533: See examples in Hall, § 211.]\r\n\r\nAs regards the duty of belligerents to respect neutral territory,\r\nprogress was also made in the eighteenth century. Whenever neutral\r\nterritory was violated, reparation was asked and made. But it was\r\nconsidered lawful for the victor to pursue the vanquished army into\r\nneutral territory, and, likewise, for a fleet to pursue[534] the\r\ndefeated enemy fleet into neutral territorial waters.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 534: See below, §§ 320 and 347 (4).]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: First Armed Neutrality.]\r\n\r\n§ 289. Whereas, on the whole, the duty of neutrals to remain impartial\r\nand the duty of belligerents to respect neutral territory became\r\ngenerally recognised during the eighteenth century, the members of the\r\nFamily of Nations did not come to an agreement during this period\r\nregarding the treatment of neutral vessels trading with belligerents. It\r\nis true that the right of visit and search for contraband of war and the\r\nright to seize the latter was generally recognised, but in other\r\nrespects no general theory and practice was agreed upon. France and\r\nSpain upheld the rule that neutral goods on enemy ships as well as\r\nneutral ships carrying enemy goods could be seized by belligerents.\r\nAlthough England granted from time to time, by special treaties with\r\nspecial States, the rule \"Free ship, free goods,\" her general practice\r\nthroughout the eighteenth century followed the rule of the _Consolato\r\ndel Mare_, according to which enemy goods on neutral vessels may be\r\nconfiscated, whereas neutral goods on enemy vessels must be restored.\r\nEngland, further, upheld the principle that the commerce of neutrals\r\nshould in time of war be restricted to the same limits as in time of\r\npeace, since most States in time of peace reserved cabotage and trade\r\nwith their colonies to vessels of their own merchant marine. It was in\r\n1756 that this principle first came into question. In this year, during\r\nwar with England, France found that on account of the naval superiority\r\nof England she was unable to carry on her colonial trade by her own\r\nmerchant marine, and she, therefore, threw open this trade to vessels of\r\nthe Netherlands, which had remained neutral. England, however, ordered\r\nher fleet to seize all such vessels with their cargoes on the ground\r\nthat they had become incorporated with the French merchant marine, and\r\nhad thereby acquired enemy character. From this time the above principle\r\nis commonly called the \"rule[535] of 1756.\" England, thirdly, followed\r\nother Powers in the practice of declaring enemy coasts to be blockaded\r\nand condemning captured neutral vessels for breach of blockade, although\r\nthe blockades were by no means always effective.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 535: See Phillimore, III. §§ 212-222; Hall, § 234; Manning,\r\npp. 260-267; Westlake, II. p. 254; Moore, VII. § 1180; Boeck, No. 52:\r\nDupuis, Nos. 131-133. Stress must be laid on the fact that the original\r\nmeaning of the rule of 1756 is different from the meaning it received by\r\nits extension in 1793. From that year onwards England not only\r\nconsidered those neutral vessels which embarked upon the French coasting\r\nand colonial trade thrown open to them during the war with England, as\r\nhaving acquired enemy character, but likewise those neutral vessels\r\nwhich carried neutral goods from neutral ports to ports of a French\r\ncolony. This extension of the rule of 1756 was clearly unjustified, and\r\nit is not possible to believe that it will ever be revived.]\r\n\r\nAs privateering was legitimate and in general use, neutral commerce was\r\nconsiderably disturbed during every war between naval States. Now in\r\n1780, during war between Great Britain, her American colonies, France,\r\nand Spain, Russia sent a circular[536] to England, France, and Spain, in\r\nwhich she proclaimed the following five principles: (1) That neutral\r\nvessels should be allowed to navigate from port to port of belligerents\r\nand along their coasts; (2) that enemy goods on neutral vessels,\r\ncontraband excepted, should not be seized by belligerents; (3) that,\r\nwith regard to contraband, articles 10 and 11 of the treaty of 1766\r\nbetween Russia and Great Britain should be applied in all cases; (4)\r\nthat a port should only be considered blockaded if the blockading\r\nbelligerent had stationed vessels there, so as to create an obvious\r\ndanger for neutral vessels entering the port; (5) that these principles\r\nshould be applied in the proceedings and judgments on the legality of\r\nprizes. In July and August 1780, Russia[537] entered into a treaty,\r\nfirst with Denmark and then with Sweden, for the purpose of enforcing\r\nthose principles by equipping a number of men-of-war. Thus the \"Armed\r\nNeutrality\" made its appearance. In 1781, the Netherlands, Prussia, and\r\nAustria, in 1782 Portugal, and in 1783 the Two Sicilies joined the\r\nleague. France, Spain, and the United States of America accepted the\r\nprinciples of the league without formally joining. The war between\r\nEngland, the United States, France, and Spain was terminated in 1783,\r\nand the war between England and the Netherlands in 1784, but in the\r\ntreaties of peace the principles of the \"Armed Neutrality\" were not\r\nmentioned. This league had no direct practical consequences, since\r\nEngland retained her former standpoint. Moreover, some of the States\r\nthat had joined the league acted contrary to some of its principles when\r\nthey themselves went to war--as did Sweden during her war with Russia\r\n1788-1790, and France and Russia in 1793--and some of them concluded\r\ntreaties in which were stipulations at variance with those principles.\r\nNevertheless, the First Armed Neutrality has proved of great importance,\r\nbecause its principles have furnished the basis of the Declaration of\r\nParis of 1856.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 536: Martens, _R._ III. p. 158.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 537: Martens, _R._ III. pp. 189 and 198.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The French Revolution and the Second Armed Neutrality.]\r\n\r\n§ 290. The wars of the French Revolution showed that the time was not\r\nyet ripe for the progress aimed at by the First Armed Neutrality.\r\nRussia, the very same Power which had initiated the Armed Neutrality in\r\n1780 under the Empress Catharine II. (1762-1796), joined Great Britain\r\nin 1793 in order to interdict all neutral navigation into ports of\r\nFrance, with the intention of subduing France by famine. Russia and\r\nEngland justified their attitude by the exceptional character of their\r\nwar against France, which country had proved to be the enemy of the\r\nsecurity of all other nations. The French Convention answered with an\r\norder to the French fleet to capture all neutral ships carrying\r\nprovisions to enemy ports or carrying enemy goods.\r\n\r\nBut although Russia herself had acted in defiance of the principles of\r\nthe First Armed Neutrality, she called a second into existence in 1800,\r\nduring the reign of the Emperor Paul. The Second Armed Neutrality was\r\ncaused by the refusal of England to concede immunity from visit and\r\nsearch to neutral merchantmen under convoy.[538] Sweden was the first to\r\nclaim in 1653, during war between Holland and Great Britain, that the\r\nbelligerents should not visit and search Swedish merchantmen under\r\nconvoy of Swedish men-of-war, provided a declaration was made by the\r\nmen-of-war that the merchantmen had no contraband on board. Other States\r\nlater raised the same claim, and many treaties were concluded which\r\nstipulated the immunity from visit and search of neutral merchantmen\r\nunder convoy. But Great Britain refused to recognise the principle, and\r\nwhen, in July 1800, a British squadron captured a Danish man-of-war and\r\nher convoy of several merchantmen for having resisted visit and search,\r\nRussia invited Sweden, Denmark, and Prussia to renew the \"Armed\r\nNeutrality,\" and to add to its principles the further one, that\r\nbelligerents should not have a right of visit and search in case the\r\ncommanding officer of the man-of-war, under whose convoy neutral\r\nmerchantmen were sailing, should declare that the convoyed vessels did\r\nnot carry contraband of war. In December 1800 Russia concluded treaties\r\nwith Sweden, Denmark, and Prussia consecutively, by which the \"Second\r\nArmed Neutrality\" became a fact.[539] But it lasted only a year on\r\naccount of the assassination of the Emperor Paul of Russia on March 23,\r\nand the defeat of the Danish fleet by Nelson on April 2, 1801, in the\r\nbattle of Copenhagen. Nevertheless, the Second Armed Neutrality likewise\r\nproved of importance, for it led to a compromise in the \"Maritime\r\nConvention\" concluded by England and Russia under the Emperor Alexander\r\nI. on June 17, 1801, at St. Petersburg.[540] By article 3 of this\r\ntreaty, England recognised, as far as Russia was concerned, the rules\r\nthat neutral vessels might navigate from port to port and on the coasts\r\nof belligerents, and that blockades must be effective. But in the same\r\narticle England enforced recognition by Russia of the rule that enemy\r\ngoods on neutral vessels may be seized, and she did not recognise the\r\nimmunity of neutral vessels under convoy from visit and search,\r\nalthough, by article 4, she conceded that the right of visit and search\r\nshould be exercised only by men-of-war, and not by privateers, in case\r\nthe neutral vessels concerned sailed under convoy.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 538: See below, § 417.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 539: Martens, _R._ VII. pp. 127-171. See also Martens, _Causes\r\nCélèbres_, IV. pp. 218-302.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 540: Martens, _R._ VII. p. 260.]\r\n\r\nBut this compromise did not last long. When in November 1807 war broke\r\nout between Russia and England, the former in her declaration of\r\nwar[541] annulled the Maritime Convention of 1801, proclaimed again the\r\nprinciples of the First Armed Neutrality, and asserted that she would\r\nnever again drop these principles. Great Britain proclaimed in her\r\ncounter-declaration[542] her return to those principles against which\r\nthe First and the Second Armed Neutrality were directed, and she was\r\nable to point out that no Power had applied these principles more\r\nseverely than Russia under the Empress Catharine II. after the latter\r\nhad initiated the First Armed Neutrality.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 541: Martens, _R._ VIII. p. 706.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 542: Martens, _R._ VIII. p. 710.]\r\n\r\nThus all progress made by the Maritime Convention of 1801 fell to the\r\nground. Times were not favourable to any progress. After Napoleon's\r\nBerlin decrees in 1806 ordering the boycott of all English goods,\r\nEngland declared all French ports and all the ports of the allies of\r\nFrance blockaded, and ordered her fleet to capture all ships destined to\r\nthese ports. And Russia, which had in her declaration of war against\r\nEngland in 1807 solemnly asserted that she would never again drop the\r\nprinciples of the First Armed Neutrality, by article 2 of the Ukase[543]\r\npublished on August 1, 1809, violated one of the most important of these\r\nprinciples by ordering that neutral vessels carrying enemy (English)\r\ngoods were to be stopped, the enemy goods seized, and the vessels\r\nthemselves seized if more than the half of their cargoes consisted of\r\nenemy goods.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 543: Martens, _N.R._ I. p. 484.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Neutrality during the Nineteenth Century.]\r\n\r\n§ 291. The development of the rules of neutrality during the nineteenth\r\ncentury was due to four factors.\r\n\r\n(1) The most prominent and influential factor is the attitude of the\r\nUnited States of America towards neutrality from 1793 to 1818. When in\r\n1793 England joined the war which had broken out in 1792 between the\r\nso-called First Coalition and France, Genêt, the French diplomatic envoy\r\naccredited to the United States, granted Letters of Marque to American\r\nmerchantmen manned by American citizens in American ports. These\r\nprivateers were destined to cruise against English vessels, and French\r\nPrize Courts were set up by the French Minister in connection with\r\nFrench consulates in American ports. On the complaint of Great Britain,\r\nthe Government of the United States ordered these privateers to be\r\ndisarmed and the French Prize Courts to be disorganised.[544] As the\r\ntrial of Gideon Henfield,[545] who was acquitted, proved that the\r\nMunicipal Law of the United States did not prohibit the enlistment of\r\nAmerican citizens in the service of a foreign belligerent, Congress in\r\n1794 passed an Act temporarily forbidding American citizens to accept\r\nLetters of Marque from a foreign belligerent and to enlist in the army\r\nor navy of a foreign State, and forbidding the fitting out and arming of\r\nvessels intended as privateers for foreign belligerents. Other Acts were\r\npassed from time to time. Finally, on April 20, 1818, Congress passed\r\nthe Foreign Enlistment Act, which deals definitely with the matter, and\r\nis still in force,[546] and which afforded the basis of the British\r\nForeign Enlistment Act of 1819. The example of the United States\r\ninitiated the present practice, according to which it is the duty of\r\nneutrals to prevent the fitting out and arming on their territory of\r\ncruisers for belligerents, to prevent enlistment on their territory for\r\nbelligerents, and the like.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 544: See Wharton, III. §§ 395-396.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 545: Concerning this trial, see Taylor, § 609.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 546: See Wheaton, §§ 434-437; Taylor, § 610; Lawrence, § 223.]\r\n\r\n(2) Of great importance for the development of neutrality during the\r\nnineteenth century became the permanent neutralisation of Switzerland\r\nand Belgium. These States naturally adopted and retained throughout\r\nevery war an exemplary attitude of impartiality towards the\r\nbelligerents. And each time war broke out in their vicinity they took\r\neffectual military measures for the purpose of preventing belligerents\r\nfrom making use of their neutral territory and resources.\r\n\r\n(3) The third factor is the Declaration of Paris of 1856, which\r\nincorporated into International Law the rule \"Free ship, free goods,\"\r\nthe rule that neutral goods on enemy ships cannot be appropriated, and\r\nthe rule that blockade must be effective.\r\n\r\n(4) The fourth and last factor is the general development of the\r\nmilitary and naval resources of all members of the Family of Nations. As\r\nall the larger States were, during the second half of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, obliged to keep their armies and navies at every moment ready\r\nfor war, it followed as a consequence that, whenever war broke out, each\r\nbelligerent was anxious not to injure neutral States in order to avoid\r\ntheir taking the part of the enemy. On the other hand, neutral States\r\nwere always anxious to fulfil the duties of neutrality for fear of being\r\ndrawn into the war. Thus the general rule, that the development of\r\nInternational Law has been fostered by the interests of the members of\r\nthe Family of Nations, applies also to the special case of neutrality.\r\nBut for the fact that it is to the interest of belligerents to remain\r\nduring war on good terms with neutrals, and that it is to the interest\r\nof neutrals not to be drawn into war, the institution of neutrality\r\nwould never have developed so favourably as it actually did during the\r\nnineteenth century.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Neutrality in the Twentieth Century.]\r\n\r\n§ 292. And this development has continued during the first decade of the\r\ntwentieth century. The South African and Russo-Japanese wars produced\r\nseveral incidents which gave occasion for the Second Peace Conference of\r\n1907 to take the matter of neutrality within the range of its\r\ndeliberations and to agree upon the Convention (V.) concerning the\r\nrights and duties of neutral Powers and persons in war on land, as well\r\nas upon the Convention (XIII.) concerning the rights and duties of\r\nneutral Powers in maritime war. And some of the other Conventions agreed\r\nupon at this Conference, although they do not directly concern neutral\r\nPowers, are indirectly of great importance to them. Thus the Convention\r\n(VII.) respecting the conversion of merchantmen into men-of-war\r\nindirectly concerns neutral trade as well as the Convention (VIII.)\r\nrespecting the laying of submarine mines, and the Convention (XI.)\r\nconcerning restrictions on the exercise of the right of capture. Of the\r\ngreatest importance, however, is the fact that by the as yet unratified\r\nConvention XII. the Conference agreed upon the establishment of an\r\nInternational Prize Court to serve as a Court of Appeal in such prize\r\ncases decided by the Prize Courts of either belligerent as concern the\r\ninterests of neutral Powers or their subjects. To enable this proposed\r\nCourt to find its verdicts on the basis of a generally accepted prize\r\nlaw the Naval Conference of London met in 1908 and produced, in 1909,\r\nthe Declaration of London concerning the laws of naval war, which\r\nrepresents a code comprising the rules respecting blockade, contraband,\r\nunneutral service, destruction of neutral prizes, transfer to neutral\r\nflag, enemy character, convoy, resistance to search, and compensation.\r\nAlthough the Declaration of London has been signed by only ten Powers,\r\nnone of which has as yet ratified,[547] there is no doubt that sooner or\r\nlater, perhaps with some slight modifications, it will either be\r\n_expressly_ ratified, or become customary law by the fact that maritime\r\nPowers which go to war will carry out its rules.[548] Be that as it may,\r\nthe Declaration of London is a document of epoch-making character and\r\nthe future historian of International Law will reckon its development\r\nfrom the Declaration of Paris (1856) to the Declaration of London[549]\r\n(1909).\r\n\r\n[Footnote 547: See Smith, _International Law_, 4th ed. by Wylie (1911),\r\npp. 353-371, where the chief points against ratification, and the\r\nanswers made thereto, are impartially set forth.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 548: Thus both Italy and Turkey, although the latter is not\r\neven a signatory Power, during the Turco-Italian War, complied with the\r\nrules of the Declaration of London.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 549: As regards the literature in favour and against the\r\nratification, on the part of Great Britain, of the Declaration of\r\nLondon, see above, vol.

Such States as do not take part in a war between other States are\r\nneutrals.[550] The term \"neutrality\" is derived from the Latin _neuter_.\r\nNeutrality may be defined as _the attitude of impartiality adopted by\r\nthird States towards belligerents and recognised by belligerents, such\r\nattitude creating rights and duties between the impartial States and the\r\nbelligerents_. Whether or not a third State will adopt and preserve an\r\nattitude of impartiality during war is not a matter for International\r\nLaw but for International Politics. Therefore, unless a previous treaty\r\nstipulates it expressly, no duty exists for a State, according to\r\nInternational Law, to remain neutral in war. On the other hand, it ought\r\nnot to be maintained, although this is done by some writers,[551] that\r\nevery State has by the Law of Nations a right not to remain neutral. The\r\nfact is that every Sovereign State, as an independent member of the\r\nFamily of Nations, is master of its own resolutions, and that the\r\nquestion of remaining neutral or not is, in absence of a treaty\r\nstipulating otherwise, one of policy and not of law. However, all States\r\nwhich do not expressly declare the contrary by word or action, are\r\nsupposed to be neutral, and the rights and duties arising from\r\nneutrality come into and remain in existence through the mere fact that\r\na State takes up and preserves an attitude of impartiality and is not\r\ndrawn into the war by the belligerents themselves. A special assertion\r\nof intention to remain neutral is not therefore legally necessary on the\r\npart of neutral States, although they often expressly and formally\r\nproclaim[552] their neutrality.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 550: Grotius (III. c. 17) calls them _medii in bello_;\r\nBynkershoek (I. c. 9) _non hostes qui neutrarum partium sunt_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 551: See, for instance, Vattel, III. § 106, and Bonfils, No.\r\n1443.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 552: See below, § 309.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Neutrality an Attitude of Impartiality.]\r\n\r\n§ 294. Since neutrality is an attitude of impartiality, it excludes such\r\nassistance and succour to one of the belligerents as is detrimental to\r\nthe other, and, further, such injuries to the one as benefit the other.\r\nBut it requires, on the other hand, active measures from neutral States.\r\nFor neutrals must prevent belligerents from making use of their neutral\r\nterritories and of their resources for military and naval purposes\r\nduring the war. This concerns not only actual fighting on neutral\r\nterritories, but also transport of troops, war materials, and provisions\r\nfor the troops, the fitting out of men-of-war and privateers, the\r\nactivity of Prize Courts, and the like.\r\n\r\nBut it is important to remember that the necessary attitude of\r\nimpartiality is not incompatible with sympathy with one and antipathy\r\nagainst the other belligerent, so long as such sympathy and antipathy\r\nare not realised in actions violating impartiality. Thus, not only\r\npublic opinion and the Press of a neutral State, but also the\r\nGovernment,[553] may show their sympathy to one party or another\r\nwithout thereby violating neutrality. And it must likewise be specially\r\nobserved that acts of humanity on the part of neutrals and their\r\nsubjects, such as the sending of doctors, medicine, provisions, dressing\r\nmaterial, and the like, to military hospitals, and the sending of\r\nclothes and money to prisoners of war, can never be construed as acts of\r\npartiality, although these comforts are provided for the wounded and the\r\nprisoners of one of the belligerents only.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 553: See, however, Geffcken in Holtzendorff, IV. p. 656, and\r\nFrankenbach, _Die Rechtsstellung von neutralen Staatsangehörigen in\r\nkriegführenden Staaten_ (1910), p. 53, who assert the contrary.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Neutrality an Attitude creating Rights and Duties.]\r\n\r\n§ 295. Since neutrality is an attitude during the condition of war only,\r\nthis attitude calls into existence special rights and duties which do\r\nnot generally obtain. They come into existence by the fact that the\r\noutbreak of war has been notified or has otherwise[554] unmistakably\r\nbecome known to third States who take up an attitude of impartiality,\r\nand they expire _ipso facto_ by the termination of the war.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 554: See article 2 of Convention III. of the Second Peace\r\nConference.]\r\n\r\nRights and duties deriving from neutrality do not exist before the\r\noutbreak of war, although such outbreak may be expected every moment.\r\nEven so-called neutralised States, as Switzerland and Belgium, have\r\nduring time of peace no duties connected with neutrality, although as\r\nneutralised States they have even in time of peace certain duties. These\r\nduties are not duties connected with neutrality, but duties imposed upon\r\nthe neutralised States as a condition of their neutralisation. They\r\ninclude restrictions for the purpose of safeguarding the neutralised\r\nStates from being drawn into war.[555]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 555: See above, vol. I. § 96.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Neutrality an Attitude of States.]\r\n\r\n§ 296. As International Law is a law between States only and\r\nexclusively, neutrality is an attitude of impartiality on the part of\r\nStates, and not on the part of individuals.[556] Individuals derive\r\nneither rights nor duties, according to International Law, from the\r\nneutrality of those States whose subjects they are. Neutral States are\r\nindeed obliged by International Law to prevent their subjects from\r\ncommitting certain acts, but the duty of these subjects to comply with\r\nsuch injunctions of their Sovereigns is a duty imposed upon them by\r\nMunicipal, not by International Law. Belligerents, on the other hand,\r\nare indeed permitted by International Law to punish subjects of neutrals\r\nfor breach of blockade, for carriage of contraband and for rendering\r\nunneutral service to the enemy; but the duty of subjects of neutrals to\r\ncomply with these injunctions of belligerents is a duty imposed upon\r\nthem by these very injunctions of the belligerents, and not by\r\nInternational Law. Although as a rule a State has no jurisdiction over\r\nforeign subjects on the Open Sea,[557] either belligerent has,\r\nexceptionally, by International Law, the right to punish foreign\r\nsubjects by confiscation of cargo, and eventually of the vessel itself,\r\nin case their vessels break blockade, carry contraband, or render\r\nunneutral service to the enemy; but punishment is threatened and\r\nexecuted by the belligerents, not by International Law. Therefore, if\r\nneutral merchantmen commit such acts, they neither violate neutrality\r\nnor do they act against International Law, but they simply violate\r\ninjunctions of the belligerents concerned. If they choose to run the\r\nrisk of punishment in the form of losing their property, this is their\r\nown concern, and their neutral home State need not prevent them from\r\ndoing so. But to the right of belligerents to punish subjects of\r\nneutrals for the acts specified corresponds the duty of neutral States\r\nto acquiesce on their part in the exercise of this right by either\r\nbelligerent.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 556: It should be specially observed that it is an inaccuracy\r\nof language to speak (as is commonly done in certain cases) of\r\nindividuals as being neutral. Thus, article 16 of Convention V. of the\r\nSecond Peace Conference designates the nationals of a State which is not\r\ntaking part in a war as \"neutrals.\" Thus, further, belligerents\r\noccupying enemy territory frequently make enemy individuals who are not\r\nmembers of the armed forces of the enemy take a so-called oath of\r\nneutrality.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 557: See above, vol. I. § 146.]\r\n\r\nMoreover, apart from carriage of contraband, breach of blockade, and\r\nunneutral service to the enemy, which a belligerent may punish by\r\ncapturing and confiscating the vessels or goods concerned, subjects of\r\nneutrals are perfectly unhindered in their movements, and neutral States\r\nhave in especial no duty to prevent their subjects from selling arms,\r\nmunitions, and provisions to a belligerent, from enlisting in his\r\nforces, and the like.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: No Cessation of Intercourse during Neutrality between\r\nNeutrals and Belligerents.]\r\n\r\n§ 297. Neutrality as an attitude of impartiality involves the duty of\r\nabstaining from assisting either belligerent either actively or\r\npassively, but it does not include the duty of breaking off all\r\nintercourse with the belligerents. Apart from certain restrictions\r\nnecessitated by impartiality, all intercourse between belligerents and\r\nneutrals takes place as before, a condition of peace prevailing between\r\nthem in spite of the war between the belligerents. This applies\r\nparticularly to the working of treaties, to diplomatic intercourse, and\r\nto trade. But indirectly, of course, the condition of war between\r\nbelligerents may have a disturbing influence upon intercourse between\r\nbelligerents and neutrals. Thus the treaty-rights of a neutral State may\r\nbe interfered with through occupation of enemy territory by a\r\nbelligerent; its subjects living on such territory bear in a sense enemy\r\ncharacter; its subjects trading with the belligerents are hampered by\r\nthe right of visit and search, and the right of the belligerents to\r\ncapture blockade-runners and contraband of war.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Neutrality an Attitude during War (Neutrality in Civil War).]\r\n\r\n§ 298. Since neutrality is an attitude during war, the question arises\r\nas to the necessary attitude of foreign States during civil war. As\r\ncivil war becomes real war through recognition[558] of the insurgents as\r\na belligerent Power, a distinction must be made as to whether\r\nrecognition has taken place or not. There is no doubt that a foreign\r\nState commits an international delinquency by assisting insurgents in\r\nspite of its being at peace with the legitimate Government. But matters\r\nare different after recognition. The insurgents are now a belligerent\r\nPower, and the civil war is now real war. Foreign States can either\r\nbecome a party to the war or remain neutral, and in the latter case all\r\nduties and rights of neutrality devolve upon them. Since, however,\r\nrecognition may be granted by foreign States independently of the\r\nattitude of the legitimate Government, and since recognition granted by\r\nthe latter is not at all binding upon foreign Governments, it may happen\r\nthat insurgents are granted recognition on the part of the legitimate\r\nGovernment, whereas foreign States refuse it, and _vice versa_.[559] In\r\nthe first case, the rights and duties of neutrality devolve upon foreign\r\nStates as far as the legitimate Government is concerned. Men-of-war of\r\nthe latter may visit and search merchantmen of foreign States for\r\ncontraband; a blockade declared by the legitimate Government is binding\r\nupon foreign States, and the like. But no rights and duties of\r\nneutrality devolve upon foreign States as regards the insurgents. A\r\nblockade declared by them is not binding, their men-of-war may not visit\r\nand search merchantmen for contraband. On the other hand, if insurgents\r\nare recognised by a foreign State but not by the legitimate Government,\r\nsuch foreign State has all rights and duties of neutrality so far as the\r\ninsurgents are concerned, but not so far as the legitimate Government is\r\nconcerned.[560] In practice, however, recognition of insurgents on the\r\npart of foreign States will, if really justified, always have the effect\r\nof causing the legitimate Government to grant its recognition also.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 558: See above, §§ 59 and 76, and Rougier, _Les guerres\r\nciviles et le droit des gens_ (1903), pp. 414-447.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 559: See above, § 59.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 560: See the body of nine rules regarding the position of\r\nforeign States in case of an insurrection, adopted by the Institute of\r\nInternational Law at its meeting at Neuchâtel in 1900 (_Annuaire_,\r\nXVIII. p. 227). The question as to whether, in case foreign States\r\nrefuse recognition to insurgents, although the legitimate Government has\r\ngranted it, the legitimate Government has a right of visit and search\r\nfor contraband is controversial; see _Annuaire_, XVIII. pp. 213-216.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Neutrality to be recognised by the Belligerents.]\r\n\r\n§ 299. Just as third States have no duty to remain neutral in a war, so\r\nthey have no right[561] to demand that they be allowed to remain\r\nneutral. History reports many cases in which States, although they\r\nintended to remain neutral, were obliged by one or both belligerents to\r\nmake up their minds and choose the belligerent with whom they would\r\nthrow in their lot. For neutrality to come into existence it is,\r\ntherefore, not sufficient for a third State at the outbreak of war to\r\ntake up an attitude of impartiality, but it is also necessary that the\r\nbelligerents recognise this attitude by acquiescing in it and by not\r\ntreating such third State as a party to the war. This does not mean, as\r\nhas been maintained,[562] that neutrality is based on a contract\r\nconcluded either _expressis verbis_ or by unmistakable actions between\r\nthe belligerents and third States, and that, consequently, a third State\r\nmight at the outbreak of war take up the position of one which is\r\nneither neutral nor a party to the war, reserving thereby for itself\r\nfreedom in its future resolutions and actions. Since the normal relation\r\nbetween members of the Family of Nations is peace, the outbreak of war\r\nbetween some of the members causes the others to become neutrals _ipso\r\nfacto_ by their taking up an attitude of impartiality and by their not\r\nbeing treated by the belligerents as parties to the war. Thus, it is not\r\na contract that calls neutrality into existence, but this condition is\r\nrather a legal consequence of a certain attitude on the part of third\r\nStates at the outbreak of war, on the one hand, and, on the other, on\r\nthe part of the belligerents themselves.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 561: But many writers assert the existence of such a right;\r\nsee, for instance, Vattel, III. § 106; Wheaton, § 414; Kleen, I. § 2;\r\nBonfils, No. 1443.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 562: See Heilborn, _System_, pp. 347 and 350.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nDIFFERENT KINDS OF NEUTRALITY\r\n\r\n  Vattel, III. §§ 101, 105, 107, 110--Phillimore, III. §§\r\n  138-139--Halleck, II. p. 142--Taylor, § 618--Wheaton, §§\r\n  413-425--Bluntschli, §§ 745-748--Geffcken in Holtzendorff, IV. pp.\r\n  634-636--Ullmann, § 190--Despagnet, No. 685--Pradier-Fodéré, VIII.\r\n  Nos. 3225-3231--Rivier, II. pp. 370-379--Calvo, IV. §§\r\n  2592-2642--Fiore, III. Nos. 1542-1545--Mérignhac, pp.\r\n  347-349--Pillet, pp. 277-284--Kleen, I. §§ 6-22.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Perpetual Neutrality.]\r\n\r\n§ 300. The very first distinction to be made between different kinds of\r\nneutrality is that between perpetual or other neutrality. Perpetual or\r\npermanent is the neutrality of States which are neutralised by special\r\ntreaties of the members of the Family of Nations, as at the present time\r\nthat of Switzerland, Belgium, and Luxemburg. Apart from duties arising\r\nfrom the fact of their neutralisation which are to be performed in time\r\nof peace as well as in time of war, the duties and rights of neutrality\r\nare the same for neutralised as for other States. It must be specially\r\nobserved that this concerns not only the obligation not to assist either\r\nbelligerent, but likewise the obligation to prevent them from making use\r\nof the neutral territory for their military purposes. Thus, Switzerland\r\nin 1870 and 1871, during the Franco-German War, properly prevented the\r\ntransport of troops, recruits, and war material of either belligerent\r\nover her territory, disarmed the French army which had saved itself by\r\ncrossing the Swiss frontier, and detained the members of this army until\r\nthe conclusion of peace.[563]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 563: See below, § 339.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General and Partial Neutrality.]\r\n\r\n§ 301. The distinction between general and partial neutrality derives\r\nfrom the fact that a part of the territory of a State may be\r\nneutralised,[564] as are, for instance, the Ionian Islands of Corfu and\r\nPaxo, which are now a part of the territory of the Kingdom of Greece.\r\nSuch State has the duty to remain always partially neutral--namely, as\r\nfar as its neutralised part is concerned. In contradistinction to such\r\npartial neutrality, general neutrality is the neutrality of States no\r\npart of whose territory is neutralised by treaty.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 564: See above, § 72.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Voluntary and Conventional Neutrality.]\r\n\r\n§ 302. A third distinction is that between voluntary and conventional\r\nneutrality. Voluntary (or simple or natural) is the neutrality of such\r\nState as is not bound by a general or special treaty to remain neutral\r\nin a certain war. Neutrality is in most cases voluntary, and States\r\nwhose neutrality is voluntary may at any time during the war give up\r\ntheir attitude of impartiality and take the part of either belligerent.\r\nOn the other hand, the neutrality of such State as is by treaty bound to\r\nremain neutral in a war is conventional. Of course, the neutrality of\r\nneutralised States is in every case conventional. Yet not-neutralised\r\nStates can likewise by treaty be obliged to remain neutral in a certain\r\nwar, just as in other cases they can by treaty of alliance be compelled\r\nnot to remain neutral, but to take the part of one of the belligerents.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Armed Neutrality.]\r\n\r\n§ 303. One speaks of an armed neutrality when a neutral State takes\r\nmilitary measures for the purpose of defending its neutrality against\r\npossible or probable attempts of either belligerent to make use of the\r\nneutral territory. Thus, the neutrality of Switzerland during the\r\nFranco-German War was an armed neutrality. In another sense of the term,\r\none speaks of an armed neutrality when neutral States take military\r\nmeasures for the purpose of defending the real or pretended rights of\r\nneutrals against threatening infringements on the part of either\r\nbelligerent. The First and Second Armed Neutrality[565] of 1780 and 1800\r\nwere armed neutralities in the latter sense of the term.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 565: See above, §§ 289 and 290.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Benevolent Neutrality.]\r\n\r\n§ 304. Treaties stipulating neutrality often stipulate a \"benevolent\"\r\nneutrality of the parties regarding a certain war. The term is likewise\r\nfrequently used during diplomatic negotiations. However, at present\r\nthere is no distinction between benevolent neutrality and neutrality\r\npure and simple. The idea dates from earlier times, when the obligations\r\nimposed by neutrality were not so stringent, and neutral States could\r\nfavour one of the belligerents in many ways without thereby violating\r\ntheir neutral attitude. If a State remained neutral in the then lax\r\nsense of the term, but otherwise favoured a belligerent, its neutrality\r\nwas called benevolent.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Perfect and Qualified Neutrality.]\r\n\r\n§ 305. A distinction of great practical importance was in former times\r\nthat between perfect, or absolute, and qualified, or imperfect,\r\nneutrality. The neutrality of a State was qualified if it remained\r\nneutral on the whole, but actively or passively, directly or indirectly,\r\ngave some kind of assistance to one of the belligerents in consequence\r\nof an obligation entered into by a treaty previous to the war, and not\r\nfor the special war exclusively. On the other hand, a neutrality was\r\ntermed perfect if a neutral State neither actively nor passively, and\r\nneither directly nor indirectly, favoured either belligerent. There is\r\nno doubt that in the eighteenth century, when it was recognised that a\r\nState could be considered neutral, although it was by a previous treaty\r\nbound to render more or less limited assistance to one of the\r\nbelligerents, this distinction between neutrality perfect and qualified\r\nwas justified. But during the second half of the nineteenth century it\r\nbecame controversial whether a so-called qualified neutrality was\r\nneutrality at all, and whether a State, which, in fulfilment of a treaty\r\nobligation, rendered some assistance to one of the belligerents,\r\nviolated its neutrality. The majority of modern writers[566] maintained,\r\ncorrectly I think, that a State was either neutral or not, and that a\r\nState violated its neutrality in case it rendered any assistance\r\nwhatever to one of the belligerents from any motive whatever. For this\r\nreason, a State which had entered into such obligations as those just\r\nmentioned would in time of war frequently be in a conflict of duties.\r\nFor, in fulfilling its treaty obligations, it would frequently be\r\nobliged to violate its duty of neutrality, and _vice versa_. Several\r\nwriters,[567] however, maintained that such fulfilment of treaty\r\nobligations would not contain a violation of neutrality. All doubt in\r\nthe matter ought now to be removed, since article 2 of Convention V. of\r\nthe Second Peace Conference categorically enacts that \"belligerents are\r\nforbidden to move across the territory of a neutral Power troops or\r\nconvoys either of munitions of war or of supplies.\" The principle at the\r\nback of this enactment no doubt is that a qualified neutrality has no\r\nlonger any _raison d'être_, and that neutrality must in every case be\r\nperfect.[568]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 566: See, for instance, Ullmann, § 190; Despagnet, No. 685;\r\nRivier, II. p. 378; Calvo, IV. § 2594; Taylor, § 618; Fiore, III. No.\r\n1541; Kleen, I. § 21; Hall, § 215 (see also Hall, § 219, concerning\r\npassage of troops). Phillimore, III. § 138, goes with the majority of\r\npublicists, but in § 139 he thinks that it would be too rigid to\r\nconsider acts of \"minor\" partiality which are the result of conventions\r\nprevious to the war as violations of neutrality.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 567: See, for instance, Heffter, § 144; Manning, p. 225;\r\nWheaton, §§ 425-426; Bluntschli, § 746; Halleck, II. p. 142.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 568: See above, § 77, where it has been pointed out that a\r\nneutral who takes up an attitude of qualified neutrality may nowadays be\r\nconsidered as an accessory belligerent party to the war.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Some Historical Examples of Qualified Neutrality.]\r\n\r\n§ 306. For the purpose of illustration the following instances of\r\nqualified neutrality may be mentioned:--\r\n\r\n(1) By a treaty of amity and commerce concluded in 1778 between the\r\nUnited States of America and France, the former granted for the time of\r\nwar to French privateers and their prizes the right of admission to\r\nAmerican ports, and entered into the obligation not to admit the\r\nprivateers of the enemies of France. When subsequently, in 1793, war was\r\nwaged between England and France, and England complained of the\r\nadmission of French privateers to American ports, the United States met\r\nthe complaint by advancing their treaty obligations.[569]\r\n\r\n(2) Denmark had by several treaties, especially by one of 1781,\r\nundertaken the obligation to furnish Russia with a certain number of\r\nmen-of-war and troops. When, in 1788, during war between Russia and\r\nSweden, Denmark fulfilled her obligations towards Russia, she\r\nnevertheless declared herself neutral. And although Sweden protested\r\nagainst the possibility of such qualified neutrality, she acquiesced in\r\nthe fact and did not consider herself to be at war with Denmark.[570]\r\n\r\n(3) In 1848, during war between Germany and Denmark, Great Britain,\r\nfulfilling a treaty obligation towards Denmark, prohibited the\r\nexportation of arms to Germany, whereas such exportation to Denmark\r\nremained undisturbed.[571]\r\n\r\n(4) In 1900, during the South African War, Portugal, for the purpose of\r\ncomplying with a treaty obligation[572] towards Great Britain regarding\r\nthe passage of British troops through Portuguese territory in South\r\nAfrica, allowed such passage to an English force which had landed at\r\nBeira[573] and was destined for Rhodesia.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 569: See Wheaton, § 425, and Phillimore, III. § 139.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 570: See Phillimore, III. § 140.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 571: See Geffcken in Holtzendorff, VI. p. 610, and Rivier, II.\r\np. 379.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 572: Article 11 of the treaty between Great Britain and\r\nPortugal concerning the delimitation of spheres of influence in Africa.\r\n(Martens, _N.R.G._ 2nd Ser.

Since neutrality is an attitude of impartiality deliberately\r\ntaken up by a State not implicated in a war, neutrality cannot begin\r\nbefore the outbreak of war becomes known. It is only then that third\r\nStates can make up their minds whether or not they intend to remain\r\nneutral. They are supposed to remain neutral, and the duties deriving\r\nfrom neutrality are incumbent upon them so long as they do not\r\n_expressis verbis_ or by unmistakable acts declare that they will be\r\nparties to the war. It had long been the usual practice on the part of\r\nbelligerents to notify the outbreak of war to third States for the\r\npurpose of enabling them to take up the necessary attitude of\r\nimpartiality, but such notification was not formerly in strict law\r\nnecessary. The mere fact of the knowledge of the outbreak of war which\r\nhad been obtained in any way gave a third State an opportunity of making\r\nup its mind regarding the attitude which it intended to take up, and, if\r\nit remained neutral, its neutrality was to be dated from the time of its\r\nknowledge of the outbreak of war. But it is apparent that an immediate\r\nnotification of the war on the part of belligerents is of great\r\nimportance, as thereby all doubt and controversy regarding the knowledge\r\nof the outbreak of war are excluded. For the fact must always be\r\nremembered that a neutral State may in no way be made responsible for\r\nacts of its own or of its subjects which have been performed before it\r\nknew of the war, although the outbreak of war might be expected. For\r\nthis reason article 2 of Convention III. of the Second Peace Conference\r\nenacts that belligerents must without delay send a notification of the\r\noutbreak of war, which may even be made by telegraph, to neutral Powers,\r\nand that the condition of war shall not take effect in regard to neutral\r\nPowers until after receipt of a notification, unless it be established\r\nbeyond doubt that they were in fact aware of the outbreak of war.[574]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 574: See above, §§ 94 and 95.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Commencement of Neutrality in Civil War.]\r\n\r\n§ 308. As civil war becomes real war through recognition of the\r\ninsurgents as a belligerent Power, neutrality during a civil war begins\r\nfor every foreign State from the moment recognition is granted. That\r\nrecognition might be granted or refused by foreign States independently\r\nof the attitude of the legitimate Government has been stated above in §\r\n298, where also an explanation is given of the consequences of\r\nrecognition granted either by foreign States alone or by the legitimate\r\nGovernment alone.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Establishment of Neutrality by Declarations.]\r\n\r\n§ 309. Neutrality being an attitude of States creating rights and\r\nduties, active measures on the part of a neutral state are required for\r\nthe purpose of preventing its officials and subjects from committing\r\nacts incompatible with its duty of impartiality. Now, the manifesto by\r\nwhich a neutral State orders its organs and subjects to comply with the\r\nattitude of impartiality adopted by itself is called a declaration of\r\nneutrality in the special sense of the term. Such declaration of\r\nneutrality must not, however, be confounded, on the one hand, with\r\nmanifestoes of the belligerents proclaiming to neutrals the rights and\r\nduties devolving upon them through neutrality, or, on the other hand,\r\nwith the assertions made by neutrals to belligerents or _urbi et orbi_\r\nthat they will remain neutral, although these manifestoes and assertions\r\nare often also called declarations of neutrality.[575]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 575: See above, § 293.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Municipal Neutrality Laws.]\r\n\r\n§ 310. International Law leaves the provision of necessary measures for\r\nthe establishment of neutrality to the discretion of each State. Since\r\nin constitutional States the powers of Governments are frequently so\r\nlimited by Municipal Law that they may not take adequate measures\r\nwithout the consent of their Parliaments, and since it is, so far as\r\nInternational Law is concerned, no excuse for a Government if it is by\r\nits Municipal Law prevented from taking adequate measures, several\r\nStates have once for all enacted so-called Neutrality Laws, which\r\nprescribe the attitude to be taken up by their officials and subjects in\r\ncase the States concerned remain neutral in a war. These Neutrality Laws\r\nare latent in time of peace, but their provisions become operative _ipso\r\nfacto_ by the respective States making a declaration of neutrality to\r\ntheir officials and subjects.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: British Foreign Enlistment Act.]\r\n\r\n§ 311. After the United States of America had on April 20, 1818,\r\nenacted[576] a Neutrality Law, Great Britain followed the example in\r\n1819 with her Foreign Enlistment Act,[577] which was in force till 1870.\r\nAs this Act did not give adequate powers to the Government, Parliament\r\npassed on August 9, 1870, a new Foreign Enlistment Act,[578] which is\r\nstill in force. This Act, in the event of British neutrality,\r\nprohibits--(1) The enlistment by a British subject in the military or\r\nnaval service of either belligerent, and similar acts (sections 4-7);\r\n(2) the building, equipping,[579] and despatching[580] of vessels for\r\nemployment in the military or naval service of either belligerent\r\n(sections 8-9); (3) the increase, on the part of any individual living\r\non British territory, of the armament of a man-of-war of either\r\nbelligerent being at the time in a British port (section 10); (4) the\r\npreparing or fitting out of a naval or military expedition against a\r\nfriendly State (section 11).\r\n\r\n[Footnote 576: Printed in Phillimore, I. pp. 667-672.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 577: 59 Geo. III. c. 69.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 578: 33 and 34 Vict. c. 90. See Sibley in the _Law Magazine\r\nand Review_, XXIX. (1904), pp. 453-464, and XXX. (1905), pp. 37-53.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 579: According to section 30, the Interpretation Clause of the\r\nAct, \"equipping\" includes \"the furnishing of a ship with any tackle,\r\napparel, furniture, provisions, arms, munitions, or stores, or any other\r\nthing which is used in or about a ship for the purpose of fitting or\r\nadapting her for the sea or for naval service.\" It is, therefore, not\r\nlawful for British ships, in case Great Britain is neutral, to supply a\r\nbelligerent fleet direct with coal, a point which became of interest\r\nduring the Russo-Japanese War. German steamers laden with coal followed\r\nthe Russian fleet on her journey to the Far East, and British shipowners\r\nwere prevented from doing the same by the Foreign Enlistment Act. And it\r\nwas in application of this Act that the British Government ordered, in\r\n1904, the detention of the German steamer _Captain W. Menzel_, which\r\ntook in Welsh coal at Cardiff for the purpose of carrying it to the\r\nRussian fleet _en route_ to the Far East. See below, § 350.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 580: An interesting case which ought here to be mentioned\r\noccurred in October 1904, during the Russo-Japanese War. Messrs. Yarrow\r\n& Co., the shipbuilders, possessed a partly completed vessel, the\r\n_Caroline_, which could be finally fitted up either as a yacht or as a\r\ntorpedo-boat. In September 1904, a Mr. Sinnet and the Hon. James Burke\r\nRoche called at the shipbuilding yard of Messrs. Yarrow, bought the\r\n_Caroline_, and ordered her to be fitted up as a high-speed yacht. The\r\nrequired additions were finished on October 3. On October 6 the vessel\r\nleft Messrs. Yarrow's yard and was navigated by a Captain Ryder, _via_\r\nHamburg, to the Russian port of Libau, there to be altered into a\r\ntorpedo-boat. That section 8 of the Foreign Enlistment Act applies to\r\nthis case there is no doubt. But there is no doubt either that it is\r\nthis Act, and not the rules of International Law, which required the\r\nprosecution of Messrs. Sinnet and Roche on the part of the British\r\nGovernment. For, if viewed from the basis of International Law, the case\r\nis merely one of contraband. See below, §§ 321, 334, and 397.]\r\n\r\nIt must be specially observed that the British Foreign Enlistment Act\r\ngoes beyond the requirements of International Law in so far as it tries\r\nto prohibit and penalises a number of acts which, according to the\r\npresent rules of International Law, a neutral State is not required to\r\nprohibit and penalise. Thus, for instance, a neutral State need not\r\nprohibit its private subjects from enlisting in the service of a\r\nbelligerent; from supplying coal, provisions, arms, and ammunition\r\ndirect to a belligerent fleet, provided such fleet is not within or just\r\noutside the territorial waters of the neutral concerned; from selling\r\nships to a belligerent although it is known that they will be converted\r\ninto cruisers or used as transport ships. For article 7 of Convention\r\nVII. as well as of Convention XIII. of the Second Peace Conference\r\ncategorically enacts that \"a neutral Power is not bound to prevent the\r\nexport or transit, on behalf of either belligerent, of arms, munitions\r\nof war, or, in general, of anything which could be of use to an army or\r\nfleet.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: End of Neutrality.]\r\n\r\n§ 312. Neutrality ends with the war, or through the commencement of war\r\nby a hitherto neutral State against one of the belligerents, or through\r\none of the belligerents commencing war against a hitherto neutral State.\r\nSince, apart from a treaty obligation, no State has by International Law\r\nthe duty to remain neutral in a war between other States,[581] or, if it\r\nis a belligerent, to allow a hitherto neutral State to remain\r\nneutral,[582] it does not constitute a violation of neutrality on the\r\npart of a hitherto neutral to declare war against one of the\r\nbelligerents, and on the part of a belligerent to declare war against a\r\nneutral. Duties of neutrality exist so long only as a State remains\r\nneutral. They come to an end _ipso facto_ by a hitherto neutral State\r\nthrowing up its neutrality, or by a belligerent beginning war against a\r\nhitherto neutral State. But the ending of neutrality must not be\r\nconfounded with violation of neutrality. Such violation does not _ipso\r\nfacto_ bring neutrality to an end, as will be shown below in § 358.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 581: See above, § 293.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 582: See above, § 299.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nRELATIONS BETWEEN BELLIGERENTS AND NEUTRALS\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nRIGHTS AND DUTIES DERIVING FROM NEUTRALITY\r\n\r\n  Vattel, III. § 104--Hall, § 214--Phillimore, III. §§\r\n  136-138--Twiss, II. § 216--Heffter, § 146--Geffcken in\r\n  Holtzendorff, IV. pp. 656-657--Gareis, § 88--Liszt, § 42--Ullmann,\r\n  § 191--Bonfils, Nos. 1441-1444--Despagnet, Nos. 684 and\r\n  690--Rivier, II. pp. 381-385--Nys, III. pp. 582-639--Calvo, IV. §§\r\n  2491-2493--Fiore, III.

Neutrality can be carried out only if neutrals as well as\r\nbelligerents follow a certain line of conduct in their relations with\r\none another. It is for this reason that from neutrality derive rights\r\nand duties, as well for belligerents as for neutrals, and that,\r\nconsequently, neutrality can be violated as well by belligerents as by\r\nneutrals. These rights and duties are correspondent: the duties of\r\nneutrals correspond to the rights of either belligerent, and the duties\r\nof either belligerent correspond to the rights of the neutrals.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: What Rights and Duties of Neutrals and of Belligerents there\r\nare.]\r\n\r\n§ 314. There are two rights and two duties deriving from neutrality for\r\nneutrals, and likewise two for belligerents.\r\n\r\nDuties of neutrals are, firstly, to act toward belligerents in\r\naccordance with their attitude of impartiality; and, secondly, to\r\nacquiesce in the exercise of either belligerent's right to punish\r\nneutral merchantmen for breach of blockade, carriage of contraband, and\r\nrendering unneutral service to the enemy, and, accordingly, to visit,\r\nsearch, and eventually capture them.\r\n\r\nThe duties of either belligerent are, firstly, to act towards neutrals\r\nin accordance with their attitude of impartiality; and, secondly, not to\r\nsuppress their intercourse, and in especial their commerce, with the\r\nenemy.[583]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 583: All writers on International Law resolve the duty of\r\nimpartiality incumbent upon neutrals into many several duties, and they\r\ndo the same as regards the duty of belligerents--namely, to act toward\r\nneutrals in accordance with the latter's impartiality. In this way quite\r\na large catalogue of duties and corresponding rights are produced, and\r\nthe whole matter is unnecessarily complicated.]\r\n\r\nEither belligerent has a right to demand impartiality from neutrals,\r\nwhereas, on the other hand, neutrals have a right to demand such\r\nbehaviour from either belligerent as is in accordance with their\r\nattitude of impartiality. Neutrals have a right to demand that their\r\nintercourse, and in especial their commerce, with the enemy shall not be\r\nsuppressed; whereas, on the other hand, either belligerent has the right\r\nto punish subjects of neutrals for breach of blockade, carriage of\r\ncontraband, and unneutral service, and, accordingly, to visit, search,\r\nand capture neutral merchantmen.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rights and Duties of Neutrals contested.]\r\n\r\n§ 315. Some writers[584] maintain that no rights derive from neutrality\r\nfor neutrals, and, consequently, no duties for belligerents, because\r\neverything which must be left undone by a belligerent regarding his\r\nrelations with a neutral must likewise be left undone in time of peace.\r\nBut this opinion has no foundation. Indeed, it is true that the majority\r\nof the acts which belligerents must leave undone in consequence of their\r\nduty to respect neutrality must likewise be left undone in time of peace\r\nin consequence of the territorial supremacy of every State. However,\r\nthere are several acts which do not belong to this class--for instance,\r\nthe non-appropriation of enemy goods on neutral vessels. And those acts\r\nwhich do belong to this class fall nevertheless at the same time under\r\nanother category. Thus, a violation of neutral territory on the part of\r\na belligerent for military and naval purposes of the war is indeed an\r\nact prohibited in time of peace, because every State has to respect the\r\nterritorial supremacy of other States; but it is at the same time a\r\nviolation of neutrality, and therefore totally different from other\r\nviolations of foreign territorial supremacy. This becomes quite apparent\r\nwhen the true inwardness of such acts is regarded. For every State has a\r\nright to demand reparation for an ordinary violation of its territorial\r\nsupremacy, but it need not take any notice of it, and it has no duty to\r\ndemand reparation. Yet in case a violation of its territorial supremacy\r\nconstitutes at the same time a violation of its neutrality, the neutral\r\nState has not only a right to demand reparation, but has a duty[585] to\r\ndo so. For, if it did not, this would contain a violation of its duty of\r\nimpartiality, because it would be favouring one belligerent to the\r\ndetriment of the other.[586]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 584: Heffter, § 149; Gareis, § 88; Heilborn, _System_, p.\r\n341.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 585: See, for instance, article 3 of Convention XIII. of the\r\nSecond Peace Conference, which enacts:--\"When a ship has been captured\r\nin the territorial waters of a neutral Power, such Power must, if the\r\nprize is still within its jurisdiction, employ the means at its disposal\r\nto release the prize with its officers and crew, and to intern the prize\r\ncrew. If the prize is not within the jurisdiction of the neutral Power,\r\nthe captor Government, on the demand of that Power, must liberate the\r\nprize with its officers and crew.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 586: See below, § 360.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it has been asserted[587] that, apart from\r\nconventional neutrality, from which treaty obligations arise, it is\r\nincorrect to speak of duties deriving from neutrality, since at any\r\nmoment during the war neutrals could throw up neutrality and become\r\nparties to the war. I cannot agree with this opinion either. That a\r\nhitherto neutral can at any moment throw up neutrality and take part in\r\nthe war, is just as true as that a belligerent can at any moment during\r\nthe war declare war against a hitherto neutral State. Yet this only\r\nproves that there is no duty to remain neutral, and no duty for a\r\nbelligerent to abstain from declaring war against a hitherto neutral\r\nState. This is a truism which ought not to be doubted, and is totally\r\ndifferent from the question as to what duties derive from neutrality so\r\nlong as a certain State remains neutral at all. The assertion that such\r\nduties derive from neutrality is in no way inconsistent with the fact\r\nthat neutrality itself can at any moment during the war come to an end\r\nthrough the beginning of war by either a neutral or a belligerent. This\r\nassertion only states the fact that, so long as neutrals intend\r\nneutrality and so long as belligerents intend to recognise such\r\nneutrality of third States, duties derive from neutrality for both\r\nbelligerents and neutrals.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 587: See Gareis, § 88.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Contents of Duty of Impartiality.]\r\n\r\n§ 316. It has already been stated above, in § 294, that impartiality\r\n_excludes_ such assistance and succour to one of the belligerents as is\r\ndetrimental to the other, and, further, such injuries to one of the\r\nbelligerents as benefit the other, and that it _includes_ active\r\nmeasures on the part of neutrals for the purpose of preventing\r\nbelligerents from making use of neutral territories and neutral\r\nresources for their military and naval purposes. But all this does not\r\nexhaust the contents of the duty of impartiality.\r\n\r\nIt must, on the one hand, be added that according to the present strict\r\nconception of neutrality the duty of impartiality of a neutral\r\n_excludes_ all facilities whatever for military and naval operations of\r\nthe belligerents, even if granted to both belligerents alike. In former\r\ntimes assistance was not considered a violation of neutrality, provided\r\nit was given to both belligerents in the same way, and States were\r\nconsidered neutral although they allowed an equal number of their troops\r\nto fight on the side of each belligerent. To-day this could no longer\r\nhappen. From Conventions V. and XIII. of the Second Peace Conference,\r\nwhich deal with neutrality in land and sea warfare respectively, it\r\nbecomes quite apparent that any facility whatever directly concerning\r\nmilitary or naval operations, even if it consists only in granting\r\npassage over neutral territory to belligerent forces, is illegal,\r\nalthough granted to both belligerents alike. _The duty of impartiality\r\nto-day comprises abstention from any active or passive co-operation with\r\nbelligerents._\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it must be added that the duty of impartiality\r\n_includes_ the equal treatment of both belligerents regarding such\r\nfacilities as do not directly concern military or naval operations, and\r\nwhich may, therefore, be granted or not to belligerents, according to\r\nthe discretion of a neutral. If a neutral grants such facilities to one\r\nbelligerent, he must grant them to the other in the same degree. If he\r\nrefuses them to the one, he must likewise refuse them to the other.[588]\r\nThus, since it does not, according to the International Law of the\r\npresent day, constitute a violation of neutrality if a neutral allows\r\nhis subjects to supply either belligerent with arms and ammunition in\r\nthe ordinary way of trade, it would constitute a violation of neutrality\r\nto prohibit the export of arms destined for one of the belligerents\r\nonly. Thus, further, if a neutral allows men-of-war of one of the\r\nbelligerents to bring their prizes into neutral ports, he must grant the\r\nsame facility to the other belligerent.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 588: See articles 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, of Convention V., and\r\narticles 7, 9, 11, 17, 19, 21, 23 of Convention XIII. of the Second\r\nPeace Conference.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Duty of Impartiality continuously growing more intense.]\r\n\r\n§ 317. Although neutrality has already for centuries been recognised as\r\nan attitude of impartiality, it has taken two hundred years for the duty\r\nof impartiality to attain its present range and intensity. Now this\r\ncontinuous development has by no means ceased. It is slowly and\r\ngradually going on, and there is no doubt that during the twentieth\r\ncentury the duty of impartiality will become much more intense than it\r\nis at present. The fact that the intensity of this duty is the result of\r\ngradual development bears upon many practical questions regarding the\r\nconduct of neutrals. It is therefore necessary to discuss separately the\r\nrelations between neutrals and belligerents in order to ascertain what\r\nline of conduct must be followed by neutrals.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Neutrality Conventions of the Second Peace Conference.]\r\n\r\n§ 317_a_. The Second Peace Conference has produced two Conventions\r\nconcerning neutrality:--\r\n\r\n(1) The Convention (V.) respecting the rights and duties of neutral\r\nPowers and persons in war on land,[589] which comprises twenty-five\r\narticles and has been signed by all the Powers represented at the\r\nConference, except China and Nicaragua; both, however, acceded later.\r\nMany Powers have already ratified. Great Britain entered a\r\nreservation[590] against articles 16-18, and Argentina against article\r\n18.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 589: See Lémonon, pp. 407-425; Higgins, pp. 290-294; Boidin,\r\npp. 121-134; Nippold, § 25; Scott, _Conferences_, pp. 541-555;\r\nBustamente in _A.J._ II. (1908), pp. 95-120.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 590: See above, § 88.]\r\n\r\n(2) The Convention (XIII.) respecting the rights and duties of neutral\r\nPowers in maritime war,[591] which comprises thirty-three articles and\r\nhas been signed by all the Powers represented at the Conference, except\r\nthe United States of America, China, Cuba, Nicaragua, and Spain; but\r\nAmerica, China, and Nicaragua acceded later. Many Powers have already\r\nratified, but there are a number of reservations; they will be dealt\r\nwith in due course when the points concerned are being discussed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 591: See Lémonon, pp. 555-606; Higgins, pp. 459-483; Bernsten,\r\n§ 13; Boidin, pp. 236-247; Dupuis, _Guerre_, Nos. 277-330; Nippold, §\r\n34; Scott, _Conferences_, pp. 620-648; Hyde in _A.J._ II. (1908), pp.\r\n507-527.]\r\n\r\nBoth Conventions deal comprehensively with the rights and duties of\r\nneutrals, but it is not convenient in a treatise on International Law\r\neither to treat separately of the duties of neutrals in war on land and\r\non sea, or to dispense with any distinction in the treatment of the\r\nseveral points concerned. The arrangement of topics in the sections of\r\nthis chapter will, therefore, be independent of the arrangement of\r\ntopics in the two Conventions, and will be as follows:--Neutrals and\r\nMilitary Operations (§§ 320-328); Neutrals and Military Preparations (§§\r\n329-335); Neutral Asylum to Soldiers and War Materials (§§ 336-341);\r\nNeutral Asylum to Naval Forces (§§ 342-348); Supplies and Loans to\r\nBelligerents (§§ 349-352); Services to Belligerents (§§ 353-356).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Contents of Duty of Belligerents to treat Neutrals in\r\naccordance with their Impartiality.]\r\n\r\n§ 318. Whereas the relations between neutrals and belligerents require\r\ndetailed discussion with regard to the duty of impartiality incumbent\r\nupon neutrals, the contents of the duty of belligerents to treat\r\nneutrals in accordance with their impartiality are so manifest that\r\nelaborate treatment is unnecessary. Such duty _excludes_, firstly, any\r\nviolation of neutral territory for military or naval purposes of the\r\nwar;[592] and, secondly, the appropriation of neutral goods, contraband\r\nexcepted, on enemy vessels.[593] On the other hand, such duty\r\n_includes_, firstly, due treatment of neutral diplomatic envoys\r\naccredited to the enemy and found on occupied enemy territory; and,\r\nsecondly, due treatment of neutral subjects and neutral property on\r\nenemy territory. A belligerent who conquers enemy territory must at\r\nleast grant to neutral envoys accredited to the enemy the right to quit\r\nthe occupied territory unmolested.[594] And such belligerent must\r\nlikewise abstain from treating neutral subjects and property\r\nestablished on enemy territory more harshly than the laws of war allow;\r\nfor, although neutral subjects and property have, by being established\r\non enemy territory, acquired enemy character, they have nevertheless not\r\nlost the protection of their neutral home State.[595] And such\r\nbelligerent must, lastly, pay full damages in case he makes use of his\r\nright of angary[596] against neutral property in course of transit\r\nthrough enemy territory.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 592: See articles 1-4 of Convention V., and articles 1-5 of\r\nConvention XIII. of the Second Peace Conference.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 593: This is stipulated by the Declaration of Paris of 1856.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 594: The position of foreign envoys found by a belligerent on\r\noccupied enemy territory is not settled as regards details. But there is\r\nno doubt that a certain consideration is due to them, and that they must\r\nat least be granted the right to depart. See above, vol. I. § 399.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 595: See above, § 88.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 596: See below, §§ 364-367.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Contents of Duty not to suppress Intercourse between Neutrals\r\nand the Enemy.]\r\n\r\n§ 319. The duty of either belligerent not to suppress intercourse of\r\nneutrals with the enemy requires no detailed discussion either. It is a\r\nduty which is in accordance with the development of the institution of\r\nneutrality. It is of special importance with regard to commerce of\r\nsubjects of neutrals with belligerents, since formerly attempts were\r\nfrequently made to intercept all neutral trade with the enemy. A\r\nconsequence of the now recognised freedom of neutral commerce with\r\neither belligerent is, firstly, the rule, enacted by the Declaration of\r\nParis of 1856, that enemy goods, with the exception of contraband, on\r\nneutral vessels on the Open Sea or in enemy territorial waters may not\r\nbe appropriated by a belligerent,[597] and, secondly, the rule, enacted\r\nby article 1 of Convention XI. of the Second Peace Conference, that the\r\npostal correspondence of neutrals or belligerents, except correspondence\r\ndestined for or proceeding from a blockaded port, which may be found on\r\na neutral or enemy vessel, is inviolable.[598] But the recognised\r\nfreedom of neutral commerce necessitates, on the other hand, certain\r\nmeasures on the part of belligerents. It would be unreasonable to impose\r\non a belligerent a duty not to prevent the subjects of neutrals from\r\nbreaking a blockade, from carrying contraband, and, lastly, from\r\nrendering unneutral service to the enemy. International Law gives,\r\ntherefore, a right to either belligerent to forbid all such acts to\r\nneutral merchantmen, and, accordingly, to visit, search, capture, and\r\npunish them.[599]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 597: That not only goods owned by enemy individuals but also\r\ngoods owned by the enemy State are exempt from appropriation when on\r\nneutral vessels, has been pointed out above, § 177, p. 220, note 2.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 598: See above, § 191, and below, § 411.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 599: That a subject of a neutral State who tries to break a\r\nblockade, or carries contraband to the enemy, or renders the enemy\r\nunneutral service, violates injunctions of the belligerents, but not\r\nInternational Law, has been shown above in § 296; see also below, §§ 383\r\nand 398.]\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nNEUTRALS AND MILITARY OPERATIONS\r\n\r\n  Vattel, III. §§ 105, 118-135--Hall, §§ 215, 219, 220,\r\n  226--Westlake, II. pp. 179-183--Lawrence, §§ 229,\r\n  234-240--Manning, pp. 225-227, 245-250--Twiss, II. §§ 217, 218,\r\n  228--Halleck, II. pp. 146, 165, 172--Taylor, §§ 618, 620, 632,\r\n  635--Walker, §§ 55, 57, 59-61--Wharton, III. §§ 397-400--Moore,\r\n  VII. §§ 1293-1303--Wheaton, §§ 426-429--Bluntschli, §§ 758, 759,\r\n  763, 765, 769-773--Heffter, §§ 146-150--Geffcken in Holtzendorff,\r\n  IV. pp. 657-676--Ullmann, § 191--Bonfils, Nos. 1449-1457, 1460,\r\n  1469, 1470--Despagnet, Nos. 690-692--Rivier, II. pp.\r\n  395-408--Calvo, IV. §§ 2644-2664, 2683--Fiore, III.

The duty of impartiality incumbent upon a neutral must obviously\r\nprevent him from committing hostilities against either belligerent. This\r\nwould need no mention were it not for the purpose of distinction between\r\nhostilities on the one hand, and, on the other, military or naval acts\r\nof force by a neutral for the purpose of repulsing violations of his\r\nneutrality committed by either belligerent. Hostilities of a neutral are\r\nacts of force performed for the purpose of attacking a belligerent. They\r\nare acts of war, and they create a condition of war between such neutral\r\nand the belligerent concerned. If, however, a neutral does not attack a\r\nbelligerent, but only repulses him by force when he violates or attempts\r\nto violate the neutrality of the neutral, such repulse does not comprise\r\nhostilities. Thus, if men-of-war of a belligerent attack an enemy vessel\r\nin a neutral port and are repulsed by neutral men-of-war, or if\r\nbelligerent forces try to make their way through neutral territory and\r\nare forcibly prevented by neutral troops, no hostilities have been\r\ncommitted by the neutral, who has done nothing else than fulfil his duty\r\nof impartiality. Article 10 of Convention V. enacts categorically that\r\n\"the fact of a neutral Power repelling, even by force, attacks on its\r\nneutrality, cannot be considered as a hostile act.\" And stress must be\r\nlaid on the fact that it is no longer legitimate for a belligerent to\r\npursue[600] military or naval forces who take refuge on neutral\r\nterritory; should, nevertheless, a belligerent do this, he must, if\r\npossible, be repulsed by the neutral.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 600: See above, § 288, p. 352, and below, § 347 (4), p. 422.]\r\n\r\nIt is, on the other hand, likewise obvious that hostilities against a\r\nneutral on the part of either belligerent are acts of war, and not mere\r\nviolations of neutrality. If, however, belligerent forces attack enemy\r\nforces which have taken refuge on neutral territory or which are there\r\nfor other purposes, such acts are not hostilities against the neutral,\r\nbut mere violations of neutrality which must be repulsed or for which\r\nreparation must be made, as the case may be.\r\n\r\nQuite a peculiar condition arose at the outbreak of and during the\r\nRusso-Japanese War. The ends for which Japan went to war were the\r\nexpulsion of the Russian forces from the Chinese Province of Manchuria\r\nand the liberation of Korea, which was at the time an independent State,\r\nfrom the influence of Russia. Manchuria and Korea became therefore the\r\ntheatre of war, although both were neutral territories and although\r\nneither China nor Korea became parties to the war. The hostilities which\r\noccurred on these neutral territories were in no wise directed against\r\nthe neutrals concerned. This anomalous condition of matters arose out of\r\nthe inability of both China and Korea to free themselves from Russian\r\noccupation and influence. And Japan considered her action, which must be\r\nclassified as an intervention, justified on account of her vital\r\ninterests. The Powers recognised this anomalous condition by influencing\r\nChina not to take part in the war, and by influencing the belligerents\r\nnot to extend military operations beyond the borders of Manchuria.\r\nManchuria and Korea having become the theatre of war,[601] the\r\nhostilities committed there by the belligerents against one another\r\ncannot be classified as a violation of neutrality. The case of the\r\n_Variag_ and the _Korietz_ on the one hand, and, on the other, the case\r\nof the _Reshitelni_, may illustrate the peculiar condition of affairs:--\r\n\r\n(1) On February 8, 1904, a Japanese squadron under Admiral Uriu entered\r\nthe Korean harbour of Chemulpo and disembarked Japanese troops. The next\r\nmorning Admiral Uriu requested the commanders of two Russian ships in\r\nthe harbour of Chemulpo, the _Variag_ and the _Korietz_, to leave the\r\nharbour and engage him in battle outside, threatening attack inside the\r\nharbour in case they would not comply with his request. But the Russian\r\nships did comply, and the battle took place outside the harbour, but\r\nwithin Korean territorial waters.[602] The complaint made by Russia,\r\nthat in this case the Japanese violated Korean neutrality, would seem to\r\nbe unjustified, since Korea fell within the region and the theatre of\r\nwar.\r\n\r\n(2) The Russian destroyer _Reshitelni_, one of the vessels that escaped\r\nfrom Port Arthur on August 10, 1904, took refuge in the Chinese harbour\r\nof Chifu. On August 12, two Japanese destroyers entered the harbour,\r\ncaptured the _Reshitelni_, and towed her away.[603] There ought to be no\r\ndoubt that this act of the Japanese comprises a violation of\r\nneutrality,[604] since Chifu does not belong to the part of China which\r\nfell within the region of war.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 601: See above, § 71, p. 87; Lawrence, _War_, pp. 268-294;\r\nAriga, §§ 16-22.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 602: See Lawrence, _War_, pp. 279-289, and Takahashi, pp.\r\n462-466.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 603: See Lawrence, _War_, pp. 291-294, and Takahashi, pp.\r\n437-444.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 604: See below, § 361, where the case of the _General\r\nArmstrong_ is discussed.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Furnishing Troops and Men-of-War to Belligerents.]\r\n\r\n§ 321. If a State remains neutral, it violates its impartiality by\r\nfurnishing a belligerent with troops or men-of-war. And it matters not\r\nwhether a neutral renders such assistance to one of the belligerents or\r\nto both alike. Whereas Convention V. does not mention the furnishing of\r\ntroops to belligerents on the part of neutrals, article 6 of Convention\r\nXIII. enacts that \"the supply, in any manner, directly or indirectly, by\r\na neutral Power to a belligerent Power, of warships, ammunition, or war\r\nmaterial of any kind whatever, is forbidden.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, the question is controversial as to whether a neutral State,\r\nwhich in time of peace concluded a treaty with one of the belligerents\r\nto furnish him in case of war with a limited number of troops, would\r\nviolate its neutrality by fulfilling its treaty obligation. Several\r\nwriters[605] have answered the question in the negative, and there is no\r\ndoubt that during the eighteenth century such cases happened. But no\r\ncase happened during the nineteenth century, and there ought to be no\r\ndoubt that nowadays the answer must be in the affirmative, since a\r\nqualified neutrality[606] is no longer admissible.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 605: See, for instance, Bluntschli, § 759, and Heffter, § 144.\r\nSee above, § 306 (2), where the case is quoted of Denmark furnishing\r\ntroops to Russia in 1788 during a Russo-Swedish war.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 606: See above, § 305.]\r\n\r\nAs regards furnishing men-of-war to belligerents, the question arose\r\nduring the Russo-Japanese War as to whether a neutral violates his duty\r\nof impartiality by not preventing his national steamship companies from\r\nselling to a belligerent such of their liners as are destined in case of\r\nwar to be incorporated as cruisers in the national navy. The question\r\nwas discussed on account of the sale to Russia of the _Augusta Victoria_\r\nand the _Kaiserin Maria Theresia_ by the North German Lloyd, and the\r\n_Fürst Bismarck_ and the _Columbia_ by the Hamburg-American Line,\r\nvessels which were at once enrolled in the Russian Navy as second-class\r\ncruisers, re-named as the _Kuban_, _Ural_, _Don_, and _Terek_. Had these\r\nvessels, according to an arrangement with the German Government, really\r\nbeen auxiliary cruisers to the German Navy, and had the German\r\nGovernment given its consent to the transaction, a violation of\r\nneutrality would have been committed by Germany. But the German Press\r\nmaintained that these vessels had not been auxiliary cruisers to the\r\nNavy, and Japan did not lodge a protest with Germany on account of the\r\nsale. If these liners were not auxiliary cruisers to the German Navy,\r\ntheir sale to Russia was a legitimate sale of articles of\r\ncontraband.[607]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 607: See below, § 397.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Subjects of Neutrals fighting among Belligerent Forces.]\r\n\r\n§ 322. Although several States, as Great Britain[608] and the United\r\nStates of America, by their Municipal Law prohibit their subjects from\r\nenlisting in the military or naval service of belligerents, the duty of\r\nimpartiality incumbent upon neutrals does not at present include any\r\nnecessity for such prohibition, provided the individuals concerned cross\r\nthe frontier singly[609] and not in a body. But a neutral must recall\r\nhis military and naval officers who may have been serving in the army or\r\nnavy of either belligerent before the outbreak of war. A neutral must,\r\nfurther, retain military and naval officers who want to resign their\r\ncommissions for the obvious purpose of enlisting in the service of\r\neither belligerent. Therefore, when in 1877, during war between Turkey\r\nand Servia, Russian officers left the Russian and entered the Servian\r\nArmy as volunteers with permission of the Russian Government, there was\r\na violation of the duty of impartiality on the part of neutral Russia.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 608: See Section 4 of the Foreign Enlistment Act, 1870.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 609: See article 6 of Convention V.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there is no violation of neutrality in a neutral\r\nallowing surgeons and such other non-combatant members of his army as\r\nare vested with a character of inviolability according to the Geneva\r\nConvention to enlist or to remain in the service of either belligerent.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Passage of Troops and War Material through Neutral\r\nTerritory.]\r\n\r\n§ 323. In contradistinction to the practice of the eighteenth\r\ncentury,[610] it is now generally recognised that a violation of the\r\nduty of impartiality is involved when a neutral allows a belligerent the\r\npassage of troops or the transport of war material over his\r\nterritory.[611] And it matters not whether a neutral gives such\r\npermission to one of the belligerents only, or to both alike. The\r\npractice of the eighteenth century was a necessity, since many German\r\nStates consisted of parts distant one from another, so that their troops\r\nhad to pass through other Sovereigns' territories for the purpose of\r\nreaching outlying parts. At the beginning of the nineteenth century the\r\npassing of belligerent troops through neutral territory still occurred.\r\nPrussia, although she at first repeatedly refused it, at last entered in\r\n1805 into a secret convention with Russia granting Russian troops\r\npassage through Silesia during war with France. On the other hand, even\r\nbefore Russia had made use of this permission, Napoleon ordered\r\nBernadotte to march French troops through the then Prussian territory\r\nof Anspach without even asking the consent of Prussia. In spite of the\r\nprotest of the Swiss Government, Austrian troops passed through Swiss\r\nterritory in 1813, and when in 1815 war broke out again through the\r\nescape of Napoleon from the Island of Elba and his return to France,\r\nSwitzerland granted to the allied troops passage through her\r\nterritory.[612] But since that time it has become universally recognised\r\nthat all passage of belligerent troops through neutral territory must be\r\nprohibited, and the Powers declared _expressis verbis_ in the Act of\r\nNovember 20, 1815, which neutralised Switzerland, and was signed at\r\nParis,[613] that \"no inference unfavourable to the neutrality and\r\ninviolability of Switzerland can and must be drawn from the facts which\r\nhave caused the passage of the allied troops through a part of the\r\nterritory of the Swiss Confederation.\" The few instances[614] in which\r\nduring the nineteenth century States pretended to remain neutral, but\r\nnevertheless allowed the troops of one of the belligerents passage\r\nthrough their territory, led to war between the neutral and the other\r\nbelligerent.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 610: See Vattel, III. §§ 119-132.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 611: See Dumas in _R.G._ XVI. (1909), pp. 289-316.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 612: See Wheaton, §§ 418-420.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 613: See Martens, _N.R._ II. p. 741.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 614: See Heilborn, _Rechte_, pp. 8-9.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Passage of Wounded through Neutral Territory.]\r\n\r\nHowever, just as in the case of furnishing troops so in the case of\r\npassage, it is a moot point whether passage of troops can be granted\r\nwithout thereby violating the duty of impartiality incumbent upon a\r\nneutral, in case a neutral is required to grant it in consequence of an\r\nexisting State-servitude or of a treaty previous to the war. There ought\r\nto be no doubt that, since nowadays a qualified neutrality is no longer\r\nadmissible, the question must be answered in the negative.[615]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 615: See above, §§ 305 and 306, and also above, vol. I. § 207.\r\nClauss, _Die Lehre von den Staatsdienstbarkeiten_ (1894), pp. 212-217,\r\nmust likewise be referred to. See also Dumas in _R.G._ XVI. (1909), pp.\r\n286-316.]\r\n\r\n§ 324. The passage of wounded soldiers is different from that of troops.\r\nIf a neutral allows the passage of wounded soldiers, he certainly does\r\nnot render direct assistance to the belligerent concerned. But it may\r\nwell be that indirectly it is of assistance on account of the fact that\r\na belligerent, thereby relieved from transport of his wounded, can now\r\nuse the lines of communication for the transport of troops, war\r\nmaterial, and provisions. Thus, when in 1870 after the battles of Sedan\r\nand Metz, Germany applied to Belgium and Luxemburg to allow her wounded\r\nto be sent through their territories, France protested on the ground\r\nthat the relief thereby created to the lines of communication in the\r\nhands of the Germans would be an assistance to the military operations\r\nof the German Army. Belgium, on the advice of Great Britain, did not\r\ngrant the request made by Germany, but Luxemburg granted it.[616]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 616: See Hall, § 219, and Geffcken in Holtzendorff, IV. p.\r\n664.]\r\n\r\nAccording to article 14 of Convention V. a neutral Power _may_ grant the\r\npassage of wounded or sick to a belligerent. If he does grant it, the\r\ntrains bringing them must carry neither combatants nor war material, and\r\nthose of the wounded and sick who belong to the army of the other\r\nbelligerent must remain on the neutral territory concerned, must there\r\nbe guarded by the neutral Government, and must, after having recovered,\r\nbe prevented from returning to their home State and rejoining their\r\ncorps. By the stipulation of article 14 it is left to the consideration\r\nof a neutral whether or no he will allow the passage of wounded and sick\r\nto a belligerent; he will, therefore, have to investigate every case and\r\ncome to a conclusion according to its merits. It should be stated that,\r\naccording to article 15 of Convention V., the \"Geneva Convention applies\r\nto the sick and wounded interned in neutral territory.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Passage of Men-of-War.]\r\n\r\n§ 325. In contradistinction to passage of troops through his territory,\r\nthe duty of impartiality incumbent upon a neutral does not require him\r\nto forbid the passage of belligerent men-of-war through the maritime\r\nbelt forming part of his territorial waters. Article 10 of Convention\r\nXIII. categorically enacts that \"the neutrality of a Power is not\r\nviolated (_n'est pas compromise_) by the mere passage of belligerent\r\nmen-of-war and their prizes.\" Since, as stated above in Vol. I. § 188,\r\nevery littoral State may even in time of peace prohibit the passage of\r\nforeign men-of-war through its maritime belt provided such belt does not\r\nform a part of the highways for international traffic, it may certainly\r\nprohibit the passage of belligerent men-of-war in time of war. However,\r\nno duty exists for a neutral to prohibit such passage in time of war,\r\nand he need not exclude belligerent men-of-war from his ports either,\r\nalthough he may do this likewise. The reason is that such passage and\r\nsuch admittance into ports contain very little assistance indeed, and\r\nare justified by the character of the sea as an international high road.\r\nBut it is, on the other hand, obvious that belligerent men-of-war must\r\nnot commit any hostilities against enemy vessels during their passage,\r\nand must not use the neutral maritime belt and neutral ports as a basis\r\nfor their operations against the enemy.[617]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 617: See below, § 333.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Occupation of Neutral Territory by Belligerents.]\r\n\r\n§ 326. In contradistinction to the practice of the eighteenth\r\ncentury,[618] the duty of impartiality must nowadays prevent a neutral\r\nfrom permitting belligerents to occupy a neutral fortress or any other\r\npart of neutral territory. If a treaty previously entered into\r\nstipulates such occupation, it cannot be granted without violation of\r\nneutrality.[619] On the contrary, the neutral must even use force to\r\nprevent belligerents from occupying any part of his neutral territory.\r\nThe question as to whether such occupation on the part of a belligerent\r\nwould be excusable in case of extreme necessity on account of the\r\nneutral's inability to prevent the other belligerent from making use of\r\nthe neutral territory as a base for his military operations must, I\r\nthink, be answered in the affirmative, since an extreme case of\r\nnecessity in the interest of self-preservation must be considered as an\r\nexcuse.[620]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 618: See Kleen, I. § 116.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 619: See Klüber, § 281, who asserts the contrary.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 620: See Vattel, III. § 122; Bluntschli, § 782; Calvo, IV. §\r\n2642. Kleen, I. § 116, seems not to recognise an extreme necessity of\r\nthe kind mentioned above as an excuse.--There is a difference between\r\nthis case and the case which arose at the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese\r\nWar, when both belligerents invaded Korea, for, as was explained above\r\nin § 320, Korea and Manchuria fell within the region and the theatre of\r\nwar.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Prize Courts on Neutral Territory.]\r\n\r\n§ 327. It has long been universally recognised that the duty of\r\nimpartiality must prevent a neutral from permitting a belligerent to set\r\nup Prize Courts on neutral territory. The intention of a belligerent in\r\nsetting up a court on neutral territory can only be to facilitate the\r\nplundering by his men-of-war of the commerce of the enemy. A neutral\r\ntolerating such Prize Courts would, therefore, indirectly assist the\r\nbelligerent in his naval operations. During the eighteenth century it\r\nwas not considered illegitimate on the part of neutrals to allow the\r\nsetting up of Prize Courts on their territory. The _Règlement du Roi de\r\nFrance concernant les prises qui seront conduites dans les ports\r\nétrangers, et des formalités que doivent remplir les Consuls de S.M. qui\r\ny sont établis_ of 1779, furnishes a striking proof of it. But since in\r\n1793 the United States of America disorganised the French Prize Courts\r\nset up by the French envoy Genêt on her territory,[621] it became\r\nrecognised that such Prize Courts are inconsistent with the duty of\r\nimpartiality incumbent upon a neutral, and article 4 of Convention XIII.\r\nenacts this formerly customary rule.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 621: See above, § 291 (1.)]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Belligerent's Prizes in Neutral Ports.]\r\n\r\n§ 328. It would, no doubt, be an indirect assistance to the naval\r\noperations of a belligerent if a neutral allowed him to organise on\r\nneutral territory the safekeeping of prizes or their sale.\r\n\r\nBut the case of a temporary stay of a belligerent man-of-war with her\r\nprize in a neutral port is different. Neutral Powers may--although most\r\nmaritime States no longer do it--allow prizes to be brought temporarily\r\ninto their ports. Articles 21 and 22 of Convention XIII. lay down the\r\nfollowing rules in the matter: A prize may only be brought into a\r\nneutral port on account of unseaworthiness, stress of weather, or want\r\nof fuel or provisions; it must leave as soon as the circumstances which\r\njustified its entry are at an end, and if it does not, the neutral Power\r\nmust order it to leave at once and must, in case of disobedience, employ\r\nthe means at disposal to release the prize with its officers and crew,\r\nand to intern the prize-crew; a prize brought into a neutral port for\r\nreasons other than unseaworthiness, stress of weather, or want of fuel\r\nor provisions, must forthwith be released by the respective neutral\r\nPower.\r\n\r\nThe question requires attention as to whether a prize whose\r\nunseaworthiness is so great that it cannot be repaired, may be allowed\r\nto remain in the neutral port and be there sold[622] after the competent\r\nPrize Court has condemned it. Since article 21 enacts that an admitted\r\nprize must leave the neutral port as soon as the circumstances which\r\njustified its entry are at an end, there is no doubt that it may remain\r\nif it cannot by repair be made seaworthy. And there ought, consequently,\r\nto be no objection to its sale in the neutral port, provided it has\r\npreviously been condemned by the proper Prize Court.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 622: See Kleen, vol. I. § 115.]\r\n\r\nWhile the stipulation of article 21 cannot meet with any objection, the\r\nstipulation of article 23 of Convention XIII. is of a very doubtful\r\ncharacter. This article enacts that a neutral Power may allow prizes to\r\nenter its ports, whether under convoy or not, when they are brought\r\nthere to be sequestrated pending the decision of a Prize Court. And it\r\nis of importance to state the fact that the restriction of article 21\r\ndoes not apply to prizes brought into a neutral port under the rule of\r\narticle 23. This rule actually enables a belligerent to safeguard all\r\nhis prizes against recapture, and a neutral Power which allows\r\nbelligerent prizes access to its ports under the rule of article 23\r\nwould indirectly render assistance to the naval operations of the\r\nbelligerent concerned. For this reason, Great Britain as well as Japan\r\nand Siam entered a reservation against article 23. Be that as it may,\r\nthose Powers which have accepted article 23 will not, I believe, object\r\nto the sale in the neutral port concerned of such sequestrated prizes,\r\nprovided they have previously been condemned by the proper Prize Court.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nNEUTRALS AND MILITARY PREPARATIONS\r\n\r\n  Hall, §§ 217-218, 221-225--Lawrence, §§ 234-240--Westlake, II. pp.\r\n  181-198--Manning, pp. 227-244--Phillimore, III. §§\r\n  142-151B--Twiss, II. §§ 223-225--Halleck, II. pp. 152-163--Taylor,\r\n  §§ 616, 619, 626-628--Walker, §§ 62-66--Wharton, III. §§ 392,\r\n  395-396--Wheaton, §§ 436-439--Moore, VII. §§ 1293-1305--Heffter,\r\n  §§ 148-150--Geffcken in Holtzendorff, IV. pp. 658-660,\r\n  676-684--Ullmann, § 191--Bonfils, Nos. 1458-1459,\r\n  1464-1466--Despagnet, Nos. 692-693--Rivier, II. pp.\r\n  395-408--Calvo, IV. §§ 2619-2627--Fiore, III.

Although according to the present intense conception of the duty\r\nof impartiality neutrals need not[623] prohibit their subjects from\r\nsupplying belligerents with arms and the like in the ordinary way of\r\ntrade, a neutral must[624] prohibit belligerents from erecting and\r\nmaintaining on his territory depôts and factories of arms, ammunition,\r\nand military provisions. However, belligerents can easily evade this by\r\nnot keeping depôts and factories, but contracting with subjects of the\r\nneutral concerned in the ordinary way of trade for any amount of arms,\r\nammunition, and provisions.[625]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 623: See below, § 350.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 624: See Bluntschli, § 777, and Kleen, I. § 114.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 625: The distinction made by some writers between an\r\noccasional supply on the one hand, and, on the other, an organised\r\nsupply in large proportions by subjects of neutrals, and the assertion\r\nthat the latter must be prohibited by the neutral concerned, is not\r\njustified. See below, § 350.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Levy of Troops, and the like.]\r\n\r\n§ 330. In former centuries neutrals were not required to prevent\r\nbelligerents from levying troops on their neutral territories, and a\r\nneutral often used to levy troops himself on his territory for\r\nbelligerents without thereby violating his duty of impartiality as\r\nunderstood in those times. In this way the Swiss Confederation\r\nfrequently used to furnish belligerents, and often both parties, with\r\nthousands of recruits, although she herself always remained neutral. But\r\nat the end of the eighteenth century a movement was started which tended\r\nto change this practice. In 1793 the United States of America\r\ninterdicted the levy of troops on her territory for belligerents, and\r\nby-and-by many other States followed the example. During the nineteenth\r\ncentury the majority of writers maintained that the duty of impartiality\r\nmust prevent a neutral from allowing the levy of troops. The few[626]\r\nwriters who differed made it a condition that a neutral, if he allowed\r\nsuch levy at all, must allow it to both belligerents alike. The\r\ncontroversy is now finally settled, for articles 4 and 5 of Convention\r\nV. lay down the rules that corps of combatants may not be formed, nor\r\nrecruiting offices opened, on the territory of a neutral Power, and that\r\nneutral Powers must not allow these acts.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 626: See, for instance, Twiss, II. § 225, and Bluntschli, §\r\n762.]\r\n\r\nThe duty of impartiality must likewise prevent a neutral from allowing\r\na belligerent man-of-war reduced in her crew to enrol sailors in his\r\nports, with the exception of such few men as are absolutely necessary to\r\nnavigate the vessel to the nearest home port.[627]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 627: See article 18 of Convention XIII. and below, § 333 (3),\r\nand § 346.]\r\n\r\nA pendant to the levy of troops on neutral territory was the granting of\r\nLetters of Marque to vessels belonging to the merchant marine of\r\nneutrals. Since privateering has practically disappeared, the question\r\nas to whether neutrals must prohibit their subjects from accepting\r\nLetters of Marque from a belligerent,[628] need not be discussed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 628: See above, § 83. With the assertion of many writers that\r\na subject of a neutral who accepts Letters of Marque from a belligerent\r\nmay be treated as a pirate, I cannot agree. See above, vol. I. § 273.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Passage of Bodies of Men intending to Enlist.]\r\n\r\n§ 331. A neutral is not obliged by his duty of impartiality to interdict\r\npassage through his territory to men either singly or in numbers who\r\nintend to enlist. Thus in 1870 Switzerland did not object to Frenchmen\r\ntravelling through Geneva for the purpose of reaching French corps or to\r\nGermans travelling through Basle for the purpose of reaching German\r\ncorps, under the condition, however, that these men travelled without\r\narms and uniform. On the other hand, when France during the\r\nFranco-German War organised an office[629] in Basle for the purpose of\r\nsending bodies of Alsatian volunteers through Switzerland to the South\r\nof France, Switzerland correctly prohibited this on account of the fact\r\nthat this _official_ organisation of the passage of whole bodies of\r\nvolunteers through her neutral territory was more or less equal to a\r\npassage of troops.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 629: See Bluntschli, § 770.]\r\n\r\nThe Second Peace Conference has sanctioned this distinction, for article\r\n6 of Convention V. enacts that \"the responsibility of a neutral Power is\r\nnot involved by the mere fact that persons cross the frontier\r\nindividually (_isolément_) in order to offer their services to one of\r\nthe belligerents.\" An _argumentum e contrario_ justifies the conclusion\r\nthat the responsibility of a neutral _is_ involved in case it does allow\r\nmen to cross the frontier in a body in order to enlist in the forces of\r\na belligerent.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Organisation of Hostile Expeditions.]\r\n\r\n§ 332. If the levy and passage of troops, and the forming of corps of\r\ncombatants, must be prevented by a neutral, he is all the more required\r\nto prevent the organisation of a hostile expedition from his territory\r\nagainst either belligerent. Such organisation takes place when a band of\r\nmen combine under a commander for the purpose of starting from the\r\nneutral territory and joining the belligerent forces. The case, however,\r\nis different, if a number of individuals, not organised into a body\r\nunder a commander, start in company from a neutral State for the purpose\r\nof enlisting with one of the belligerents. Thus in 1870, during the\r\nFranco-German War, 1200 Frenchmen started from New York in two French\r\nsteamers for the purpose of joining the French Army. Although the\r\nvessels carried also 96,000 rifles and 11,000,000 cartridges, the United\r\nStates did not interfere, since the men were not organised in a body,\r\nand since, on the other hand, the arms and ammunition were carried in\r\nthe way of ordinary commerce.[630]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 630: See Hall, § 222.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Use of Neutral Territory as Base of Naval Operations.]\r\n\r\n§ 333. Although a neutral is not required by his duty of impartiality to\r\nprohibit[631] the passage of belligerent men of-war through his maritime\r\nbelt, or the temporary stay of such vessels in his ports, it is\r\nuniversally recognised that he must not allow admitted vessels to make\r\nthe neutral maritime belt and neutral ports the base of their naval\r\noperations against the enemy. And article 5 of Convention XIII. enacts\r\nthat \"belligerents are forbidden to use neutral ports and waters as a\r\nbase of naval operations against their adversaries.\" The following rules\r\nmay be formulated as emanating from the principle:--\r\n\r\n(1) A neutral must, so far as is in his power, prevent belligerent\r\nmen-of-war from cruising within his portion of the maritime belt for the\r\npurpose of capturing enemy vessels as soon as they leave this belt. It\r\nmust, however, be specially observed that a neutral is not required to\r\nprevent this beyond his power. It is absolutely impossible to prevent\r\nsuch cruising under all circumstances and conditions, especially in the\r\ncase of neutrals who own possessions in distant parts of the globe. How\r\nmany thousands of vessels would be necessary, if Great Britain, for\r\ninstance, were unconditionally obliged to prevent such cruising in every\r\nportion of the maritime belt of all her numerous possessions scattered\r\nover all parts of the globe?\r\n\r\n(2) A neutral must prevent a belligerent man-of-war from leaving a\r\nneutral port at the same time as an enemy man-of-war or an enemy\r\nmerchantman, or must make other arrangements which prevent an attack so\r\nsoon as both reach the Open Sea.[632] Article 16 of Convention XIII.\r\nenacts that there must be an interval of at least twenty-four hours\r\nbetween the departure of a belligerent warship and a ship of the other\r\nbelligerent.\r\n\r\n(3) A neutral must prevent a belligerent man-of-war, whose crew is\r\nreduced from any cause whatever, from enrolling sailors in his neutral\r\nports, with the exception of such few hands as are necessary for the\r\npurpose of safely navigating the vessel to the nearest port of her home\r\nState.[633]\r\n\r\n(4) A neutral must prevent belligerent men-of-war admitted to his ports\r\nor maritime belt from taking in such a quantity of provisions and coal\r\nas would enable them to continue their naval operations, for otherwise\r\nhe would make it possible for them to cruise on the Open Sea near his\r\nmaritime belt for the purpose of attacking enemy vessels.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, no unanimity of the Powers concerning the quantity of\r\nprovisions and coal which belligerent men-of-war may be allowed to take\r\nin. Articles 19 and 20 of Convention XIII. of the Second Peace\r\nConference enact the following:--\r\n\r\nArticle 19: \"Belligerent war-ships may only revictual in neutral ports\r\nor roadsteads to bring up their supplies to the peace standard.\r\nSimilarly these vessels may only ship sufficient fuel to enable them to\r\nreach the nearest port in their own country. They may, on the other\r\nhand, fill up their bunkers built to carry fuel, when in neutral\r\ncountries which have adopted this method of determining the amount of\r\nfuel to be supplied. If in accordance with the law of the neutral Power,\r\nthe ships are not supplied with coal within twenty-four hours of their\r\narrival, the duration of their permitted stay is extended by twenty-four\r\nhours.\"\r\n\r\nArticle 20: \"Belligerent war-ships which have shipped fuel in a port\r\nbelonging to a neutral Power may not within the succeeding three months\r\nreplenish their supply in a port of the same Power.\"\r\n\r\nGreat Britain, Japan, and Siam, while they have accepted article\r\n20,[634] have entered a reservation against article 19. Great Britain\r\nupholds her rule that belligerent warships shall not be allowed to take\r\nin more provisions and fuel in neutral ports than is necessary to bring\r\nthem safely to the nearest port of their own country.\r\n\r\nWhile, therefore, the matter is not settled, it is agreed that it makes\r\nno difference whether the man-of-war concerned intends to buy provisions\r\nand coal on land or to take them in from transport vessels which\r\naccompany or meet her in neutral waters.\r\n\r\n(5) A neutral must prevent belligerent men-of-war admitted into his\r\nports or maritime belt from replenishing with ammunition and armaments,\r\nand from adding to their armaments, as otherwise he would indirectly\r\nassist them in preparing for hostilities (article 18 of Convention\r\nXIII.). And it makes no difference whether the ammunition and armaments\r\nare to come from the shore or are to be taken in from transport vessels.\r\n\r\nSimilarly a neutral must prevent belligerent men-of-war in his ports and\r\nroadsteads from carrying out such repairs as would add in any manner\r\nwhatever to their fighting force. The local authorities of the neutral\r\nPower must decide what repairs are absolutely necessary to make these\r\nvessels seaworthy, and such repairs are allowed, but they must be\r\ncarried out with the least possible delay (article 17 of Convention\r\nXIII.).\r\n\r\n(6) A neutral must prevent belligerent men-of-war admitted into his\r\nports from remaining there longer than is necessary for ordinary and\r\nlegitimate purposes.[635] It cannot be said that the rule adopted in\r\n1862 by Great Britain, and followed by some other maritime States, not\r\nto allow a longer stay than twenty-four hours, is a rule of\r\nInternational Law. It is left to the consideration of neutrals to adopt\r\nby their Municipal Law any rule they think fit so long as the admitted\r\nmen-of-war do not prolong their stay for any other than ordinary and\r\nlegitimate purposes. Article 12 of Convention XIII. prescribes the\r\ntwenty-four hours rule only for those neutral countries which have not\r\nspecial provisions to the contrary in their Municipal Laws.[636] But it\r\nis agreed--and article 14 of Convention XIII. enacts it--that\r\nbelligerent men-of-war, except those exclusively for the time devoted to\r\nreligious, scientific, or philanthropic purposes, must not prolong their\r\nstay in neutral ports and waters beyond the time permitted, except on\r\naccount of damage or stress of weather. A neutral would certainly\r\nviolate his duty of impartiality if he were to allow belligerent\r\nmen-of-war to winter in his ports or to stay there for the purpose of\r\nwaiting for other vessels of the fleet or transports.\r\n\r\nThe rule that a neutral must prevent belligerent men-of-war from staying\r\ntoo long in his ports or waters, became of considerable importance\r\nduring the Russo-Japanese War, when the Russian Baltic Fleet was on its\r\nway to the Far East. Admiral Rojdestvensky is said to have stayed in the\r\nFrench territorial waters of Madagascar from December 1904 till March\r\n1905, for the purpose of awaiting there a part of the Baltic Fleet that\r\nhad set out at a later date. The Press likewise reported a prolonged\r\nstay by parts of the Baltic Fleet during April 1905 at Kamranh Bay and\r\nHon-kohe Bay in French Indo-China. Provided the reported facts be true,\r\nFrance would seem to have violated her duty of impartiality by not\r\npreventing such an abuse of her neutral ports.\r\n\r\n(7) A neutral must prevent more than three men-of-war belonging to the\r\nsame belligerent from being simultaneously in one of his ports or\r\nroadsteads unless his Municipal Law provides the contrary (article 15 of\r\nConvention XIII.).\r\n\r\n(8) At the outbreak of war a neutral must warn all belligerent\r\nmen-of-war which were in his ports or roadsteads or in his territorial\r\nwaters before the outbreak of war, to depart within twenty-four hours or\r\nwithin such time as the local law prescribes (article 13[637] of\r\nConvention XIII.).\r\n\r\n[Footnote 631: See Curtius, _Des navires de guerre dans les eaux\r\nneutres_ (1907).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 632: See below, § 347 (1).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 633: See article 18 of Convention XIII. and above, § 330.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 634: But Germany has entered a reservation against article\r\n20.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 635: See below, § 347.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 636: Germany, Domingo, Siam, and Persia have entered a\r\nreservation against article 12.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 637: Germany has entered a reservation against article 13.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Building and Fitting-out of Vessels intended for Naval\r\nOperations.]\r\n\r\n§ 334. Whereas a neutral is in no[638] wise obliged by his duty of\r\nimpartiality to prevent his subjects from selling armed vessels to the\r\nbelligerents, such armed vessels being merely contraband of war, a\r\nneutral is bound to employ the means at his disposal to prevent his\r\nsubjects from building, fitting out, or arming, to the order of either\r\nbelligerent, vessels intended to be used as men-of-war, and to prevent\r\nthe departure from his jurisdiction of any vessel which, by order of\r\neither belligerent, has been adapted to warlike use.[639] The difference\r\nbetween selling armed vessels to belligerents, on the one hand, and\r\nbuilding them to order, on the other hand, is usually defined in the\r\nfollowing way:--\r\n\r\nAn armed ship, being contraband of war, is in no wise different from\r\nother kinds of contraband, provided she is not manned in a neutral port\r\nso that she can commit hostilities at once after having reached the Open\r\nSea. A subject of a neutral who builds an armed ship or arms a\r\nmerchantman, not to order of a belligerent but intending to sell her to\r\na belligerent, does not differ from a manufacturer of arms who intends\r\nto sell them to a belligerent. There is nothing to prevent a neutral\r\nfrom allowing his subjects to sell armed vessels, and to deliver them to\r\nbelligerents, either in a neutral port or in a port of the belligerent.\r\nIn the case of the _La Santissima Trinidad_[640] (1822), as in that of\r\nthe _Meteor_[641] (1866), American courts have recognised this.[642]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 638: See below, §§ 350 and 397.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 639: See article 8 of Convention XIII.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 640: 7 Wheaton, § 340.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 641: See Wharton, III. § 396, p. 561.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 642: See Phillimore, III. § 151B, and Hall, § 224.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a subject of a neutral builds armed ships to order\r\nof a belligerent, he prepares the means of naval operations, since the\r\nships on sailing outside the territorial waters of the neutral and\r\ntaking in a crew and ammunition can at once commit hostilities. Thus,\r\nthrough carrying out the order of the belligerent, the neutral territory\r\nconcerned has been made the base of naval operations. And as the duty\r\nof impartiality includes the obligation of the neutral to prevent either\r\nbelligerent from making neutral territory the base of military or naval\r\noperations, a neutral violates his neutrality by not preventing his\r\nsubjects from carrying out an order of a belligerent for the building\r\nand fitting out of men-of-war.\r\n\r\nThis distinction, although of course logically correct, is\r\nhair-splitting. It only shows that neutral States ought[643] to be\r\nrequired to prevent their subjects from supplying arms, ammunition, and\r\nthe like, to belligerents. But so long as this progress is not made, the\r\nabove distinction will probably continue to be drawn, in spite of its\r\nhair-splitting character.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 643: See below, § 350.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The _Alabama_ Case and the Three Rules of Washington.]\r\n\r\n§ 335. The movement for recognition of the fact that the duty of\r\nimpartiality requires a neutral to prevent his subjects from building\r\nand fitting out to order of belligerents vessels intended for naval\r\noperations, began with the famous case of the _Alabama_. It is not\r\nnecessary to go into all the details[644] of this case. It suffices to\r\nsay that in 1862, during the American Civil War, the attention of the\r\nBritish Government was drawn by the Government of the United States to\r\nthe fact that a vessel for warlike purposes was built in England to\r\norder of the insurgents. This vessel, afterwards called the _Alabama_,\r\nleft Liverpool in July 1862 unarmed, but was met at the Azores by three\r\nother vessels, also coming from England, which supplied her with guns\r\nand ammunition, so that she could at once begin to prey upon the\r\nmerchantmen of the United States. On the conclusion of the Civil War,\r\nthe United States claimed damages from Great Britain for the losses\r\nsustained by her merchant marine through the operations of the\r\n_Alabama_ and other vessels likewise built in England. Negotiations went\r\non for several years, and finally the parties entered, on May 8, 1871,\r\ninto the Treaty of Washington[645] for the purpose of having their\r\ndifference settled by arbitration, five arbitrators to be\r\nnominated--Great Britain, the United States, Brazil, Italy, and\r\nSwitzerland, each choosing one. The treaty contained three rules, since\r\nthen known as \"The Three Rules of Washington,\" to be binding upon the\r\narbitrators, namely:[646]--\r\n\r\n\"A neutral Government is bound--\r\n\r\n\"_Firstly._ To use due diligence to prevent the fitting out, arming, or\r\nequipping within its jurisdiction, of any vessel which it has reasonable\r\nground to believe is intended to cruise or carry on war against a Power\r\nwith which it is at peace, and also to use like diligence to prevent the\r\ndeparture from its jurisdiction of any vessel intended to cruise or\r\ncarry on war as above, such vessel having been specially adapted in\r\nwhole or in part, within such jurisdiction, to warlike use.\r\n\r\n\"_Secondly._ Not to permit or suffer either belligerent to make use of\r\nits ports or waters as the base of naval operations against the other,\r\nor for the purpose of the renewal or augmentation of military supplies\r\nor arms, or the recruitment of men.\r\n\r\n\"_Thirdly._ To exercise due diligence in its waters, and as to all\r\npersons within its jurisdiction, to prevent any violations of the\r\nforegoing obligations and duties.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 644: See Mountague Bernard, _Neutrality of Great Britain\r\nduring the American Civil War_ (1870), pp. 338-496; Geffcken, _Die\r\nAlabama Frage_ (1872); Pradier-Fodéré, _La Question de l'Alabama_\r\n(1872); Caleb Cushing, _Le Traité de Washington_ (1874); Bluntschli in\r\n_R.I._ II.

Thus, Great\r\nBritain and the United States, although they agreed upon the three\r\nrules, did not at all agree upon the interpretation thereof, and they\r\ncould, therefore, likewise not agree upon the contents of the\r\ncommunication to other maritime States stipulated by the Treaty of\r\nWashington. It ought not, therefore, to be said that the Three Rules of\r\nWashington[650] have literally become universal rules of International\r\nLaw. Nevertheless, they were the starting-point of the movement for the\r\nuniversal recognition of the fact that the duty of impartiality obliges\r\nneutrals to prevent their subjects from building and fitting out, to\r\norder of belligerents, vessels intended for warlike purposes, and to\r\nprevent the departure from their jurisdiction of any vessel, which, by\r\norder of a belligerent, has been adapted to warlike use. Particular\r\nattention must be paid to the fact that, although article 8 of\r\nConvention XIII. in other respects copies almost verbally the first of\r\nthe Three Rules of Washington, it differs from it in so far as it\r\nreplaces the words \"to use due diligence\" by \"to employ the means at its\r\ndisposal.\" For this reason the construction put by the Geneva\r\narbitrators upon the term _due diligence_ cannot find application to the\r\nrule of article 8, the employment of the means at the disposal of a\r\nneutral to prevent the acts concerned being a mere question of fact.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 649: See below, § 363.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 650: As regards the seven rules adopted by the Institute of\r\nInternational Law, at its meeting at the Hague in 1875, as emanating\r\nfrom the Three Rules of Washington, see _Annuaire_, I.

Neutral territory, being outside the region of war,[651] offers\r\nan asylum to members of belligerent forces, to the subjects of the\r\nbelligerents and their property, and to war material of the\r\nbelligerents. Since, according to the present rules of International\r\nLaw, the duty of either belligerent to treat neutrals according to their\r\nimpartiality must--the case of extreme necessity for self-preservation\r\nexcepted--prevent them from violating the territorial supremacy of\r\nneutrals, enemy persons as well as enemy goods are perfectly safe on\r\nneutral territory. It is true that neither belligerent has a right to\r\ndemand from a neutral[652] such asylum for his subjects, their property,\r\nand his State property. But neither has he, on the other hand, any right\r\nto demand that a neutral refuse such asylum to the enemy. The\r\nterritorial supremacy of the neutral enables him to use his discretion,\r\nand either to grant or to refuse asylum. However, the duty of\r\nimpartiality incumbent upon him must induce a neutral granting asylum to\r\ntake all such measures as are necessary to prevent his territory from\r\nbeing used as a base of hostile operations.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 651: See above, §§ 70 and 71.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 652: The generally recognised usage for a neutral to grant\r\ntemporary hospitality in his ports to vessels in distress of either\r\nbelligerent is an exception to be discussed below in § 344.]\r\n\r\nNow, neutral territory may be an asylum, first, for private enemy\r\nproperty; secondly, for public enemy property, especially war material,\r\ncash, and provisions; thirdly, for private subjects of the enemy;\r\nfourthly, for enemy land forces; and, fifthly, for enemy naval forces.\r\nDetails, however, need only be given with regard to asylum to land\r\nforces, war material, and naval forces. For with regard to private\r\nproperty and private subjects it need only be mentioned that private war\r\nmaterial brought into neutral territory stands on the same footing as\r\npublic war material of a belligerent brought there, and, further, that\r\nprivate enemy subjects are safe on neutral territory even if they are\r\nclaimed by a belligerent for the committal of war crimes.\r\n\r\nOnly asylum to land forces and war material will be discussed here in §§\r\n337-341, asylum to naval forces being reserved for separate discussion\r\nin §§ 342-348. As regards asylum to land forces, a distinction must be\r\nmade between (1) prisoners of war, (2) single fugitive soldiers, and (3)\r\ntroops or whole armies pursued by the enemy and thereby induced to take\r\nrefuge on neutral territory.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Neutral Territory and Prisoners of War.]\r\n\r\n§ 337. Neutral territory is an asylum to prisoners of war of either\r\nbelligerent in so far as they become free _ipso facto_ by their coming\r\ninto neutral territory. And it matters not in which way they come there,\r\nwhether they escape from a place of detention and take refuge on neutral\r\nterritory, or whether they are brought as prisoners into such territory\r\nby enemy troops who themselves take refuge there.[653]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 653: The case of prisoners on board a belligerent man-of-war\r\nwhich enters a neutral port is different; see below, § 345.]\r\n\r\nThe principle that prisoners of war regain their liberty by coming into\r\nneutral territory has been generally recognised for centuries. An\r\nillustration occurred in 1558, when several Turkish and Barbary captives\r\nescaped from one of the galleys of the Spanish Armada which was wrecked\r\nnear Calais, and, although the Spanish Ambassador claimed them, France\r\nconsidered them to be freed by the fact of their coming on her\r\nterritory, and sent them to Constantinople.[654] But has the neutral on\r\nwhose territory a prisoner has taken refuge the duty to retain such\r\nfugitives and thereby prevent them from rejoining the enemy army?\r\nFormerly this question was not settled. In 1870, during the\r\nFranco-German War, Belgium answered the question in the affirmative, and\r\ndetained a French non-commissioned officer who had been a prisoner in\r\nGermany and had escaped into Belgian territory with the intention of\r\nrejoining at once the French forces. Whereas this case was\r\ncontroversial,[655] all writers agreed that the case was different if\r\nescaped prisoners wanted to remain on the neutral territory. As such\r\nrefugees might at any subsequent time wish to rejoin their forces, the\r\nneutral was by his duty of impartiality considered to be obliged to take\r\nadequate measures to prevent their so doing. There was likewise no\r\nunanimity regarding prisoners brought into neutral territory by enemy\r\nforces taking refuge there. It was agreed that such prisoners became\r\nfree by being brought into neutral territory; but whereas some\r\nwriters[656] maintained that they could not be detained in case they\r\nintended at once to leave the neutral territory, others asserted that\r\nthey must always be detained and that they must comply with such\r\nmeasures as the neutral considers necessary to prevent them from\r\nrejoining their forces.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 654: See Hall, § 226, p. 641, note 1.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 655: See Rolin-Jaequemyns in _R.I._ III. (1871), p. 556;\r\nBluntschli, § 776; Heilborn, _Rechte_, pp. 32-34.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 656: For instance, Heilborn, _Rechte_, pp. 51-52.]\r\n\r\nArticle 13 of Convention V. settles the controversy by enacting that a\r\nneutral who receives prisoners of war who have escaped or who are\r\nbrought there by troops of the enemy taking refuge on neutral territory,\r\nshall leave them at liberty, but that, if he allows them to remain on\r\nhis territory, he _may_--he need not!--assign them a place of residence\r\nso as to prevent them from rejoining their forces. Since, therefore,\r\neverything is left to the discretion of the neutral, he will have to\r\ntake into account the merits and needs of every case and to take such\r\nsteps as he thinks adequate. But so much is certain that a belligerent\r\nmay not in every case categorically demand from a neutral who receives\r\nescaped prisoners, or such as have been brought there by troops who take\r\nrefuge, that he should detain them.\r\n\r\nThe case of prisoners who, with the consent of the neutral, are\r\ntransported through neutral territory is different. Such prisoners do\r\nnot become free on entering the neutral territory, but there is no doubt\r\nthat a neutral, by consenting to the transport, violates his duty of\r\nimpartiality, because such transport is equal to passage of troops\r\nthrough neutral territory (article 2 of Convention V.).\r\n\r\nAttention must, lastly, be drawn to the case where enemy soldiers are\r\namongst the wounded whom a belligerent is allowed by a neutral to\r\ntransport through neutral territory. Such wounded prisoners become\r\nfree, but they must, according to article 14 of Convention V., be\r\nguarded by the neutral so as to insure their not again taking part in\r\nmilitary operations.[657]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 657: See also article 15 of Convention X. and below, §\r\n348_a_.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fugitive Soldiers on Neutral Territory.]\r\n\r\n§ 338. A neutral may grant asylum to single soldiers of belligerents who\r\ntake refuge on his territory, although he need not do so, and may at\r\nonce send them back to the place they came from. If he grants such\r\nasylum, his duty of impartiality obliges him to disarm the fugitives and\r\nto take such measures as are necessary to prevent them from rejoining\r\ntheir forces. But it must be emphasised that it is practically\r\nimpossible for a neutral to be so watchful as to detect every single\r\nfugitive who enters his territory. It will always happen that such\r\nfugitives steal into neutral territory and leave it again later on to\r\nrejoin their forces without the neutral being responsible. And, before\r\nhe can incur responsibility for not doing so, a neutral must actually be\r\nin a position to detain such fugitives. Thus Luxemburg, during the\r\nFranco-German War, could not prevent hundreds of French soldiers, who,\r\nafter the capitulation of Metz, fled into her territory, from rejoining\r\nthe French forces; because, according to the condition[658] of her\r\nneutralisation, she is not allowed to keep an army, and therefore, in\r\ncontradistinction to Switzerland and Belgium, was unable to mobilise\r\ntroops for the purpose of fulfilling her duty of impartiality.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 658: See above, vol. I. § 100.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Neutral Territory and Fugitive Troops.]\r\n\r\n§ 339. On occasions during war large bodies of troops, or even a whole\r\narmy, are obliged to cross the neutral frontier for the purpose of\r\nescaping captivity. A neutral need not permit this, and may repulse them\r\non the spot, but he may also grant asylum. It is, however, obvious that\r\nthe presence of such troops on neutral territory is a danger for the\r\nother party. The duty of impartiality incumbent upon a neutral obliges\r\nhim, therefore, to disarm such troops at once, and to guard them so as\r\nto insure their not again performing military acts against the enemy\r\nduring the war. Convention V. enacts the following rules:--\r\n\r\nArticle 11: \"A neutral Power which receives in its territory troops\r\nbelonging to the belligerent armies shall detain them, if possible, at\r\nsome distance from the theatre of war. It may keep them in camps, and\r\neven confine them in fortresses or localities assigned for the purpose.\r\nIt shall decide whether officers are to be left at liberty on giving\r\ntheir parole that they will not leave the neutral territory without\r\nauthorisation.\"\r\n\r\nArticle 12: \"In the absence of a special Convention, the neutral Power\r\nshall supply the interned with the food, clothing, and relief which the\r\ndictates of humanity prescribe. At the conclusion of peace, the expenses\r\ncaused by internment shall be made good.\"\r\n\r\nIt is usual for troops who are not actually pursued by the enemy--for if\r\npursued they have no time for it--to enter through their commander into\r\na convention with the representative of the neutral concerned,\r\nstipulating the conditions upon which they cross the frontier and give\r\nthemselves into the custody of the neutral. Such conventions are valid\r\nwithout needing ratification, provided they contain only such\r\nstipulations as do not disagree with International Law and as concern\r\nonly the requirements of the case.\r\n\r\nStress must be laid on the fact that, although the detained troops are\r\nnot prisoners of war captured by the neutral, they are nevertheless in\r\nhis custody, and therefore under his disciplinary power, just as\r\nprisoners of war are under the disciplinary power of the State which\r\nkeeps them in captivity. They do not enjoy the exterritoriality--see\r\nabove, Vol. I. § 445--due to armed forces abroad because they are\r\ndisarmed. As the neutral is required to prevent them from escaping, he\r\nmust apply stern measures, and he may punish severely every member of\r\nthe detained force who attempts to frustrate such measures or does not\r\ncomply with the disciplinary rules regarding order, sanitation, and the\r\nlike.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable instance known in history is the asylum granted by\r\nSwitzerland during the Franco-German War to a French army of 85,000 men\r\nwith 10,000 horses which crossed the frontier on February 1, 1871.[659]\r\nFrance had, after the conclusion of the war, to pay about eleven million\r\nfrancs for the maintenance of this army in Switzerland during the rest\r\nof the war.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 659: See the Convention regarding this asylum between the\r\nSwiss General Herzog and the French General Clinchant in Martens,\r\n_N.R.G._ XIX. p. 639.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Neutral Territory and Non-combatant Members of Belligerent\r\nForces.]\r\n\r\n§ 340. The duty of impartiality incumbent upon a neutral obliges him to\r\ndetain in the same way as soldiers such non-combatant[660] members of\r\nbelligerent forces as cross his frontier. He may not, however, detain\r\narmy surgeons and other non-combatants who are privileged according to\r\narticle 2 of the Geneva Convention.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 660: See Heilborn, _Rechte_, pp. 43-46. Convention V. does not\r\nmention any rule concerning this matter.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Neutral Territory and War Material of Belligerents.]\r\n\r\n§ 341. It can happen during war that war material belonging to one of\r\nthe belligerents is brought into neutral territory for the purpose of\r\nsaving it from capture by the enemy. Such war material can be brought by\r\ntroops crossing the neutral frontier for the purpose of evading\r\ncaptivity, or it can be purposely sent there by order of a commander.\r\nNow, a neutral is by no means obliged to admit such material, just as he\r\nis not obliged to admit soldiers of belligerents. But if he admits it,\r\nhis duty of impartiality obliges him to seize and retain it till after\r\nthe conclusion of peace. War material includes, besides arms,\r\nammunition, provisions, horses, means of military transport such as\r\ncarts and the like, and everything else that belongs to the equipment\r\nof troops. But means of military transport belong to war material only\r\nso far as they are the property of a belligerent. If they are hired or\r\nrequisitioned from private individuals, they may not be detained by the\r\nneutral.\r\n\r\nIt can likewise happen during war that war material, originally the\r\nproperty of one of the belligerents but seized and appropriated by the\r\nenemy, is brought by the latter into neutral territory. Does such\r\nmaterial, through coming into neutral territory, become free, and must\r\nit be restored to its original owner, or must it be retained by the\r\nneutral and after the war be restored to the belligerent who brought it\r\ninto the neutral territory? In analogy with prisoners of war who become\r\nfree through being brought into neutral territory, it is maintained[661]\r\nthat such war material becomes free and must be restored to its original\r\nowner. To this however, I cannot agree.[662] Since war material becomes\r\nthrough seizure by the enemy his property and remains his property\r\nunless the other party re-seizes and thereby re-appropriates it, there\r\nis no reason for its reverting to its original owner upon transportation\r\ninto neutral territory.[663]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 661: See Hall, § 226.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 662: See Heilborn, _Rechte_, p. 60, and _Land Warfare_, § 492.\r\nThe Dutch Government at the Second Peace Conference proposed a rule\r\naccording to which captured war material brought by the captor into\r\nneutral territory should be restored, after the war, to its original\r\nowner, but--see _Deuxième Conférence, Actes_, vol. i. p. 145--this\r\nproposal was not accepted.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 663: See Heilborn, _Rechte_, pp. 61-65, where the question is\r\ndiscussed as to whether a neutral may claim a lien on war material\r\nbrought into his territory for expenses incurred for the maintenance of\r\ndetained troops belonging to the owner of the war material.]\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nNEUTRAL ASYLUM TO NAVAL FORCES\r\n\r\n  Vattel, III. § 132--Hall, § 231--Twiss, II. § 222--Halleck, II. p.\r\n  151--Taylor, §§ 635, 636, 640--Wharton, III. § 394--Wheaton, §\r\n  434--Moore, VII. §§ 1314-1318--Bluntschli, §§ 775-776B--Heffter, §\r\n  149--Geffcken in Holtzendorff, IV. pp. 665-667, 674--Ullmann, §\r\n  191--Bonfils, No. 1463--Despagnet, No. 692 _ter_--Rivier, II. p.\r\n  405--Calvo, IV. §§ 2669-2684--Fiore, III.

Whereas asylum granted by a neutral to land forces and single\r\nmembers of them is conditioned by the obligation of the neutral to\r\ndisarm such forces and to detain them for the purpose of preventing them\r\nfrom joining in further military operations, a neutral may grant\r\ntemporary asylum to men-of-war of belligerents without being obliged to\r\ndisarm and detain them.[664] The reason is that the sea is considered an\r\ninternational highway, that the ports of all nations serve more or less\r\nthe interests of international traffic on the sea, and that the\r\nconditions of navigation make a certain hospitality of ports to vessels\r\nof all nations a necessity. Thus the rules of International Law\r\nregarding asylum of neutral ports to men-of-war of belligerents have\r\ndeveloped on somewhat different lines from the rules regarding asylum to\r\nland forces. But the rule, that the duty of impartiality incumbent upon\r\na neutral must prevent him from allowing belligerents to use his\r\nterritory as a base of operations of war, is nevertheless valid\r\nregarding asylum granted to their men-of-war.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 664: See, however, below, § 347, concerning the abuse of\r\nasylum, which must be prohibited.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Neutral Asylum to Naval Forces optional.]\r\n\r\n§ 343. Although a neutral may grant asylum to belligerent men-of-war in\r\nhis ports, he has no duty to do so. He may prohibit all belligerent\r\nmen-of-war from entering any of his ports, whether these vessels are\r\npursued by the enemy or desire to enter for other reasons. However, his\r\nduty of impartiality must prevent him from denying to the one party what\r\nhe grants to the other, and he may not, therefore, allow entry to\r\nmen-of-war of one belligerent without giving the same permission to\r\nmen-of-war of the other belligerent (article 9 of Convention XIII.).\r\nNeutrals as a rule admit men-of-war of both parties, but they frequently\r\nexclude all men-of-war of both parties from entering certain ports. Thus\r\nAustria prohibited during the Crimean War all belligerent men-of-war\r\nfrom entering the port of Cattaro. Thus, further, Great Britain\r\nprohibited during the American Civil War the access of all belligerent\r\nmen-of-war to the ports of the Bahama Islands, the case of stress of\r\nweather excepted.\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, since a neutral must prevent belligerents from making\r\nhis territory the base of military operations, he must not allow an\r\nunlimited number of men-of-war belonging to one of the belligerents to\r\nstay simultaneously in one of his ports. Article 15 of Convention XIII.\r\nlimits the number of such men-of-war to three, unless there are special\r\nprovisions to the contrary in the Municipal Law of the neutral\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Asylum to Naval Forces in Distress.]\r\n\r\n§ 344. To the rule that a neutral need not admit men-of-war of the\r\nbelligerents to neutral ports there is no exception in strict law.\r\nHowever, there is an international usage that belligerent men-of-war in\r\ndistress should never be prevented from making for the nearest port. In\r\naccordance with this usage vessels in distress have always been allowed\r\nentry even to such neutral ports as were totally closed to belligerent\r\nmen-of-war. There are even instances known of belligerent men-of-war in\r\ndistress having asked for and been granted asylum by the enemy in an\r\nenemy port.[665]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 665: See above, § 189.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Exterritoriality of Men-of-War during Asylum.]\r\n\r\n§ 345. The exterritoriality, which according to a universally recognised\r\nrule of International Law men-of-war must enjoy[666] in foreign ports,\r\nobtains even in time of war during their stay in neutral ports.\r\nTherefore, prisoners of war on board do not become free by coming into\r\nthe neutral port[667] so long as they are not brought on shore, nor do\r\nprizes[668] brought into neutral ports by belligerents. On the other\r\nhand, belligerent men-of-war are expected to comply with all orders\r\nwhich the neutral makes for the purpose of preventing them from making\r\nhis ports the base of their operations of war, as, for instance, with\r\nthe order not to leave the ports at the same time as vessels of the\r\nother belligerent. And, if they do not comply voluntarily, they may be\r\nmade to do so through application of force, for a neutral has the duty\r\nto prevent by all means at hand the abuse of the asylum granted.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 666: See above, vol. I. § 450.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 667: See above, § 337.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 668: See articles 21-23 of Convention XIII.]\r\n\r\nSpecial provision is made by article 24 of Convention XIII. for the case\r\nof a belligerent man-of-war which refuses to leave a neutral port. This\r\narticle enacts:--\"If, notwithstanding the notification of the neutral\r\nPower, a belligerent ship of war does not leave a port where it is not\r\nentitled to remain, the neutral Power is entitled to take such measures\r\nas it considers necessary to render the ship incapable of putting to sea\r\nso long as the war lasts, and the commanding officer of the ship must\r\nfacilitate the execution of such measures. When a belligerent ship is\r\ndetained by a neutral Power, the officers and crew are likewise\r\ndetained. The officers and crew so detained may be left in the ship or\r\nkept either on another vessel or on land, and may be subjected to such\r\nmeasures of restriction as it may appear necessary to impose upon them.\r\nA sufficient number of men must, however, be always left on board for\r\nlooking after the vessel. The officers may be left at liberty on giving\r\ntheir word not to quit neutral territory without permission.\"\r\n\r\nIf a vessel is granted asylum for the whole time of the war--see below,\r\n§ 347 (3 and 4)--and is, therefore, dismantled, she loses the character\r\nof a man-of-war, no longer enjoys the privilege of exterritoriality due\r\nto men-of-war in foreign waters, and prisoners on board become free,\r\nalthough they must be detained by the neutral concerned.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Facilities to Men-of-War during Asylum.]\r\n\r\n§ 346. A belligerent man-of-war, to which asylum is granted in a neutral\r\nport, is not only not disarmed and detained, but facilities may even be\r\nrendered to her as regards slight repairs, and the supply of provisions\r\nand coal. However, a neutral may only allow small repairs of the vessel\r\nherself and not of her armaments;[669] for he would render assistance to\r\none of the belligerents, to the detriment of the other, if he were to\r\nallow the damaged armaments of a belligerent man-of-war to be repaired\r\nin a neutral port. And, further, a neutral may only allow a limited\r\namount of provisions and coal to be taken in by a belligerent man-of-war\r\nin neutral ports;[670] for, if he did otherwise, he would allow the\r\nbelligerent to use the neutral ports as a base for operations of war.\r\nAnd, lastly, a neutral may allow a belligerent man-of-war in his ports\r\nto enrol only such a small number of sailors as is necessary to navigate\r\nher safely to the nearest port of her home State.[671]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 669: See above, § 333 (5), and below, § 347 (3).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 670: See above, § 333 (4).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 671: See above, §§ 330 and 333 (3).]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Abuse of Asylum to be prohibited.]\r\n\r\n§ 347. It would be easy for belligerent men-of-war to which asylum is\r\ngranted in neutral ports to abuse such asylum if neutrals were not\r\nrequired to prohibit such abuse.\r\n\r\n(1) A belligerent man-of-war can abuse asylum, firstly, by ascertaining\r\nwhether and what kind of enemy vessels are in the same neutral port,\r\naccompanying them when they leave, and attacking them immediately they\r\nreach the Open Sea. To prevent such abuse, in the eighteenth century\r\nseveral neutral States arranged that, if belligerent men-of-war or\r\nprivateers met enemy vessels in a neutral port, they were not to be\r\nallowed to leave together, but an interval of at least twenty-four hours\r\nwas to elapse between the sailing of the vessels. During the nineteenth\r\ncentury this so-called twenty-four hours rule was enforced by the\r\nmajority of States, and the Second Peace Conference, by article 16 of\r\nConvention XIII., has made it a general rule[672] by enacting:--\"When\r\nwar-ships belonging to both belligerents are present simultaneously in a\r\nneutral port or roadstead, a period of not less than twenty-four hours\r\nmust elapse between the departure of the ship belonging to one\r\nbelligerent and the departure of the ship belonging to the other. The\r\norder of departure is determined by the order of arrival, unless the\r\nship which arrived first is so circumstanced that an extension of its\r\nstay is permissible. A belligerent war-ship may not leave a neutral port\r\nor roadstead until twenty-four hours after the departure of a merchant\r\nship flying the flag of its adversary.\"\r\n\r\n(2) Asylum can, secondly, be abused by wintering in a port in order to\r\nwait for other vessels of the same fleet, or by similar intentional\r\ndelay. There is no doubt that neutrals must prohibit this abuse by\r\nordering such belligerent men-of-war to leave the neutral ports.\r\nFollowing the example set by Great Britain in 1862,[673] several\r\nmaritime States have adopted the rule of not allowing a belligerent\r\nman-of-war to stay in their neutral ports for more than twenty-four\r\nhours, except on account of damage or stress of weather. Other States,\r\nsuch as France, do not, however, object to a more prolonged stay in\r\ntheir ports. Article 12 of Convention XIII. prescribes the twenty-four\r\nhours rule only for those neutral countries which have not special\r\nprovisions to the contrary in their Municipal Laws.[674]\r\n\r\n(3) Asylum can, thirdly, be abused by repairing a belligerent man-of-war\r\nwhich has become unseaworthy. Although small repairs are allowed,[675] a\r\nneutral would violate his duty of impartiality by allowing such repairs\r\nas would make good the unseaworthiness of a belligerent man-of-war.\r\nDuring the Russo-Japanese War this was generally recognised, and the\r\nRussian men-of-war _Askold_ and _Grossovoi_ in Shanghai, the _Diana_ in\r\nSaigon, and the _Lena_ in San Francisco had therefore to be disarmed and\r\ndetained. The crews of these vessels had likewise to be detained for the\r\ntime of the war.\r\n\r\n(4) Asylum can, lastly, be abused by remaining in a neutral port an\r\nundue length of time in order to escape attack and capture by the other\r\nbelligerent. Neutral territorial waters are in fact an asylum for\r\nmen-of-war which are pursued by the enemy, but, since nowadays a right\r\nof pursuit into neutral waters, as asserted by Bynkershoek,[676] is no\r\nlonger recognised, it would be an abuse of asylum if the escaped vessel\r\nwere allowed to make a prolonged stay in the neutral waters. A neutral\r\nwho allowed such abuse of asylum would violate his duty of impartiality,\r\nfor he would assist one of the belligerents to the disadvantage of the\r\nother.[677] Therefore, when after the battle off Port Arthur in August\r\n1904 the Russian battleship _Cesarewitch_, the cruiser _Novik_, and\r\nthree destroyers escaped, and took refuge in the German port of\r\nTsing-Tau in Kiao-Chau, the _Novik_, which was uninjured, had to leave\r\nthe port after a few hours,[678] whereas the other vessels, which were\r\ntoo damaged to leave the port, were disarmed and, together with their\r\ncrews, detained till the conclusion of peace. And when, at the end of\r\nMay 1905, after the battle of Tsu Shima, three injured Russian\r\nmen-of-war, the _Aurora_, _Oleg_, and _Jemchug_, escaped into the\r\nharbour of Manila, the United States of America ordered them to be\r\ndisarmed and, together with their crews, to be detained during the war.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 672: See above, § 333 (2), and Hall, § 231, p. 651.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 673: See Hall, § 231, p. 653.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 674: See above, § 333 (6)--Germany, Domingo, Siam, and Persia\r\nhave entered a reservation against article 12.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 675: See above, § 333 (5) and § 346.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 676: _Quaest. jur. publ._ I. c. 8.

Until the Russo-Japanese War it was still a\r\ncontroverted question whether a neutral is obliged either to dismiss or\r\nto disarm and detain such men-of war as had fled into his ports for the\r\npurpose of escaping attack and capture. See Hall, § 231, p. 651, and\r\nPerels, § 39, p. 213, in contradistinction to Fiore, III. No. 1578. The\r\n\"Règlement sur le régime légal des navires et de leurs équipages dans\r\nles ports étrangers,\" adopted by the Institute of International Law in\r\n1898 at its meeting at the Hague--see _Annuaire_, XVII. (1898), p.\r\n273--answers (article 42) the question in the affirmative.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 678: This case marks the difference between the duties of\r\nneutrals as regards asylum to land and naval forces. Whereas land forces\r\ncrossing neutral frontiers must either be at once repulsed or detained,\r\nmen-of-war may be granted the right to stay for some limited time within\r\nneutral harbours and to leave afterwards unhindered; see above, § 342.\r\nThe supply of a small quantity of coal to the _Novik_ in Tsing-Tau was\r\ncriticised by writers in the Press, but unjustly. For--see above, §\r\n346--a neutral may allow a belligerent man-of-war in his port to take in\r\nso much coal as is necessary to navigate her to her nearest home port.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Neutral Men-of-War as an Asylum.]\r\n\r\n§ 348. It can happen during war that neutral men-of-war pick up and save\r\nfrom drowning soldiers and sailors of belligerent men-of-war sunk by the\r\nenemy, or that they take belligerent marines on board for other reasons.\r\nSuch neutral men-of-war being an asylum for the rescued marines, the\r\nquestion has arisen whether such rescued marines must be given up to the\r\nenemy, or must be detained during the war, or may be brought to their\r\nhome country. Two cases are on record which illustrate this matter.\r\n\r\n(1) At the beginning of the Chino-Japanese War, on July 25, 1894, after\r\nthe Japanese cruiser _Naniwa_ had sunk the British ship _Kow-shing_,\r\nwhich served as transport carrying Chinese troops,[679] forty-five\r\nChinese soldiers who clung to the mast of the sinking ship were rescued\r\nby the French gunboat _Lion_ and brought to the Korean harbour of\r\nChemulpo. Hundreds of others saved themselves on some islands near the\r\nspot where the incident occurred, and 120 of these were taken on board\r\nthe German man-of-war _Iltis_ and brought back to the Chinese port of\r\nTientsin.[680]\r\n\r\n(2) At the beginning of the Russo-Japanese War, on February 9, 1904,\r\nafter the Russian cruisers _Variag_ and _Korietz_ had accepted the\r\nchallenge[681] of a Japanese fleet, fought a battle outside the harbour\r\nof Chemulpo, and returned, crowded with wounded, to Chemulpo, the\r\nBritish cruiser _Talbot_, the French _Pascal_, and the Italian _Elba_\r\nreceived large numbers of the crews of the disabled Russian cruisers.\r\nThe Japanese demanded that the neutral ships should give up the rescued\r\nmen as prisoners of war, but the neutral commanders demurred, and an\r\narrangement was made according to which the rescued men were handed over\r\nto the Russians under the condition that they should not take part in\r\nhostilities during the war.[682]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 679: See above, § 89, p. 114, note 1.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 680: See Takahashi, _Cases on International Law during the\r\nChino-Japanese War_ (1899), pp. 36 and 51.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 681: See above, § 320 (1).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 682: See Lawrence, _War_, pp. 63-75, and Takahashi, pp.\r\n462-466.]\r\n\r\nThe Second Peace Conference has settled the question, for article 13 of\r\nConvention X. enacts:--\"If wounded, sick, or shipwrecked are taken on\r\nboard a neutral man-of-war, precaution must be taken, so far as\r\npossible, that they do not again take part in the operations of the\r\nwar.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Neutral Territory and Shipwrecked Soldiers.]\r\n\r\n§ 348_a_. Just as in war on land members of the belligerent forces may\r\nfind themselves on neutral territory, so in war on sea shipwrecked or\r\nwounded or sick belligerent soldiers can be brought into neutral\r\nterritory. Two cases of this kind must be distinguished:--\r\n\r\n(1) According to article 14 of Convention X. it is left to the\r\nbelligerent man-of-war who captures shipwrecked, wounded, or sick enemy\r\nsoldiers to send them to a neutral port. The neutral Power concerned\r\nneed not receive them, but, on the other hand, may grant them asylum. If\r\nasylum is granted, the neutral Power is, according to article 15 of\r\nConvention X., obliged--unless there is an arrangement to the contrary\r\nbetween the neutral Power and both belligerents--to guard them so as to\r\nprevent them from again taking part in the war,[683] the expenses for\r\ntending and interning them to be paid by the belligerent to whom they\r\nbelong.\r\n\r\n(2) Neutral merchantmen[684] can either of their own accord have rescued\r\nwounded, sick, or shipwrecked men, or they can have taken them on board\r\non appeal by belligerent men-of-war. The surrender of these men may,\r\naccording to article 12 of Convention X., be demanded at any time by any\r\nbelligerent man-of-war. But if such demand be not made and the men be\r\nbrought into a neutral port, they need not be detained by the neutral\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 683: See above, § 205.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 684: See above, § 208 (2).]\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nSUPPLIES AND LOANS TO BELLIGERENTS\r\n\r\n  Vattel, III. § 110--Hall, §§ 216-217--Lawrence, § 235--Westlake,\r\n  II. pp. 217-219--Phillimore, III. § 151--Twiss, II. §\r\n  227--Halleck, II. p. 163--Taylor, §§ 622-625--Walker, §\r\n  67--Wharton, III. §§ 390-391--Moore, VII. §§\r\n  1307-1312--Bluntschli, §§ 765-768--Heffter, § 148--Geffcken in\r\n  Holtzendorff, IV. pp. 687-700--Ullmann, §§ 191-192--Bonfils, Nos.\r\n  1471-1474--Despagnet, Nos. 693-694--Rivier, II. pp.\r\n  385-411--Calvo, IV. §§ 2624-2630--Fiore, III.

The duty of impartiality must prevent a neutral from supplying\r\nbelligerents with arms, ammunition, vessels, and military\r\nprovisions.[685] And it matters not whether such supply takes place for\r\nmoney or gratuitously. A neutral who sold arms and ammunition to a\r\nbelligerent at a profit would violate his duty of impartiality as also\r\nwould one who transferred such arms and ammunition to a belligerent as a\r\npresent. This is a settled rule so far as direct transactions regarding\r\nsuch supply between belligerents and neutrals are concerned. The case is\r\ndifferent where a neutral does not directly and knowingly deal with a\r\nbelligerent, although he may, or ought to, be aware that he is\r\nindirectly supplying a belligerent. Different States have during\r\nneutrality taken up different attitudes regarding such cases. Thus in\r\n1825, during the War of Independence which the Spanish South American\r\nColonies waged against their mother country, the Swedish Government sold\r\nthree old men-of-war, the _Försigtigheten_, _Euridice_, and _Camille_ to\r\ntwo merchants, who on their part sold them to English merchants,\r\nrepresentatives of the Government of the Mexican insurgents. When Spain\r\ncomplained, Sweden rescinded the contract.[686] Further, the British\r\nGovernment in 1863, during the American Civil War, after selling an old\r\ngunboat, the _Victor_, to a private purchaser and subsequently finding\r\nthat the agents of the Confederate States had obtained possession of\r\nher, gave the order that during the war no more Government ships should\r\nbe sold.[687] On the other hand, the Government of the United States of\r\nAmerica, in pursuance of an Act passed by Congress in 1868 for the sale\r\nof arms which the end of the Civil War had rendered superfluous, sold in\r\n1870, notwithstanding the Franco-German War, thousands of arms and other\r\nwar material which were shipped to France.[688] This attitude of the\r\nUnited States is now generally condemned, and article 6 of Convention\r\nXIII. may be quoted against a repetition of such a practice on the part\r\nof a neutral State. This article prohibits the supply in any manner,\r\ndirectly or _indirectly_, by a neutral to a belligerent, of warships,\r\nammunition, or war material of any kind whatever.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 685: See article 6 of Convention XIII.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 686: See Martens, _Causes Célèbres_, V. pp. 229-254.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 687: See Lawrence, § 235.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 688: See Wharton, III. § 391, and Moore, VII. § 1309.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Supply on the part of Subjects of Neutrals.]\r\n\r\n§ 350. In contradistinction to supply to belligerents by neutrals, such\r\nsupply by subjects of neutrals is lawful, and neutrals are not,\r\ntherefore, obliged according to their duty of impartiality to prevent\r\nsuch supply. Article 7 of Convention V. and article 7 of Convention\r\nXIII. concur in enacting the old customary rule that \"A neutral Power is\r\nnot bound to prevent the export or transit, on behalf of one or other of\r\nthe belligerents, of arms, munitions of war, or, in general, of anything\r\nwhich can be of use to an army or fleet.\" And article 18[689] of\r\nConvention V. recognises the fact that the furnishing of supplies to a\r\nbelligerent by such subjects of neutrals as do not live on the territory\r\nof the other party, or on the territory occupied by that party, does\r\nnot invest these individuals with enemy character. When in August 1870,\r\nduring the Franco-German War, Germany lodged complaints with the British\r\nGovernment for not prohibiting its subjects from supplying arms and\r\nammunition to the French Government, Great Britain correctly replied\r\nthat she was not by International Law under the obligation to prevent\r\nher subjects from committing such acts. Of course, such neutral as is\r\nanxious to avoid all controversy and friction can by his Municipal Law\r\norder his subjects to abstain from such acts, as for instance\r\nSwitzerland and Belgium did during the Franco-German War. But such\r\ninjunctions arise from political prudence, and not from any obligation\r\nimposed by International Law.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 689: That Great Britain has entered a reservation against\r\narticle 18, and the portent of this reservation, has been pointed out\r\nabove, in § 88, p. 109, note 1.]\r\n\r\nThe endeavour to make a distinction between supply in single cases and\r\non a small scale on the one hand, and, on the other, supply on a large\r\nscale, and to consider only the former lawful,[690] has neither in\r\ntheory nor in practice found recognition. As International Law stands,\r\nbelligerents may make use of visit, search, and seizure to protect\r\nthemselves against conveyance of contraband by sea to the enemy by\r\nsubjects of neutrals. But so far as their neutral home State is\r\nconcerned, such subjects may, at the risk of having their property\r\nseized during such conveyance, supply either belligerent with any amount\r\nof arms, ammunition, coal, provisions, and even with armed ships,[691]\r\nprovided always that they deal with the belligerents in the ordinary way\r\nof commerce.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 690: See Bluntschli, § 766.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 691: See above, § 334, and below, § 397.]\r\n\r\nThe case is different when there is no ordinary commerce with a\r\nbelligerent Government and when subjects of neutrals directly supply a\r\nbelligerent army or navy, or parts of them. If, for instance, a\r\nbelligerent fleet is cruising outside the maritime belt of a neutral,\r\nthe latter must prevent vessels of his subjects from bringing coal,\r\narms, ammunition, and provisions to that fleet, for otherwise he would\r\nallow the belligerent to make use of neutral resources for naval\r\noperations.[692] But he need not prevent vessels of his subjects from\r\nbringing coal, arms, ammunition, and provisions to belligerent ports,\r\nalthough the supply is destined for the navy and the army of the\r\nbelligerent. He need not prevent belligerent merchantmen from coming\r\ninto his ports and carrying arms and the like, bought from his subjects,\r\nover to the ports of their home State. And he need not prevent vessels\r\nof his subjects from following a belligerent fleet and supplying it _en\r\nroute_[693] with coal, ammunition, provisions, and the like, provided\r\nsuch supply does not take place in the neutral maritime belt.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 692: See above, § 333 (4).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 693: See above, § 311, p. 375, note 4.]\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that, as the law stands at present, neutrals need not\r\nprevent their subjects from supplying belligerents with arms and\r\nammunition. Yet, on the other hand, there is no doubt either that such\r\nsupply is apt to prolong a war which otherwise would come to an end at\r\nan earlier date. But it will be a long time, if ever it happens, before\r\nit is made a duty of neutrals to prevent such supply as far as is in\r\ntheir power, and to punish such of their subjects as engage in it. The\r\nprofit derived from such supply being enormous, the members of the\r\nFamily of Nations are not inclined to cripple the trade of their\r\nsubjects by preventing it. And belligerents want to have the opportunity\r\nof replenishing with arms and ammunition if they run short of them\r\nduring war. The question is merely one of the standard of public\r\nmorality.[694] If this standard rises, and it becomes the conviction of\r\nthe world at large that supply of arms and ammunition by subjects of\r\nneutrals is apt to lengthen wars, the rule will appear that neutrals\r\nmust prevent such supply.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 694: See above, vol. I. § 51 (6) p. 83.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Loans and Subsidies on the part of Neutrals.]\r\n\r\n§ 351. His duty of impartiality must prevent a neutral from granting a\r\nloan to either belligerent. Vattel's (III. § 110) distinction between\r\nsuch loans as are granted on interest and such as are not so granted,\r\nand his assertion that loans on the part of neutrals are lawful if they\r\nare granted on interest with the pure intention of making money, have\r\nnot found favour with other writers. Nor do I know any instance of such\r\nloan on interest having occurred during the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nWhat is valid regarding a loan is all the more valid regarding subsidies\r\nin money granted to a belligerent on the part of a neutral. Through the\r\ngranting of subsidies a neutral becomes as much the ally of the\r\nbelligerent as he would by furnishing him with a number of troops.[695]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 695: See above, §§ 305, 306, 321.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Loans and Subsidies on the part of Subjects of Neutrals.]\r\n\r\n§ 352. It was formerly a moot point in the theory of International Law\r\nwhether a neutral is obliged by his duty of impartiality to prevent his\r\nsubjects from granting subsidies and loans to belligerents for the\r\npurpose of enabling them to continue the war. Several writers[696]\r\nmaintained either that a neutral was obliged to prevent such loans and\r\nsubsidies altogether, or at least that he must prohibit a public\r\nsubscription on neutral territory for such loans and subsidies. On the\r\nother hand, a number of writers asserted that, since money is just as\r\nmuch an article of commerce as goods, a neutral was in no wise obliged\r\nto prevent on his territory public subscription by his subjects to loans\r\nfor the belligerents. In contradistinction to the theory of\r\nInternational Law, the practice of the States has beyond doubt\r\nestablished the fact that neutrals need not prevent on their territory\r\nsubscription to loans for belligerents. Thus in 1854, during the Crimean\r\nWar, France protested in vain against a Russian loan being raised in\r\nAmsterdam, Berlin, and Hamburg. In 1870, during the Franco-German War, a\r\nFrench loan was raised in London. In 1877, during the Russo-Turkish War,\r\nno neutral prevented his subjects from subscribing to the Russian loan.\r\nAgain, in 1904, during the Russo-Japanese War, Japanese loans were\r\nraised in London and Berlin, and Russian loans in Paris and Berlin. The\r\nSecond Peace Conference, by enacting in article 7 of Convention V. that\r\na neutral is not bound to prevent the export ... of anything which can\r\nbe of use to an army or fleet, has indirectly recognised that a neutral\r\nneed not prevent the subscription on his territory to loans for\r\nbelligerents.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 696: See Phillimore, III. § 151; Bluntschli, § 768; Heffter, §\r\n148; Kleen, I. § 68. The case of _De Wütz_ v. _Hendricks_ (9 Moore, 586)\r\nquoted by Phillimore in support of his assertion that neutrals must\r\nprevent their subjects from subscribing to a loan for belligerents, is\r\nnot decisive, for Lord Chief Justice Best declared only \"that it was\r\ncontrary to the Law of Nations for persons residing in this country to\r\nenter into any agreements to raise money by way of a loan for the\r\npurpose of _supporting subjects of a foreign State in arms against a\r\nGovernment in alliance with our own_.\"]\r\n\r\nBut matters differ somewhat in regard to subsidies to belligerents by\r\nsubjects of neutrals. A neutral is not indeed obliged to prevent\r\nindividual subjects from granting subsidies to belligerents, just as he\r\nis not obliged to prevent them from enlisting with either belligerent.\r\nBut if he were to allow on his territory a public appeal for\r\nsubscriptions to such subsidy, he would certainly violate his duty of\r\nimpartiality; for loans are a matter of commerce, subsidies are not. It\r\nmust, however, be emphasised that public appeals for subscriptions of\r\nmoney for charitable purposes in favour of the wounded, the prisoners,\r\nand the like, need not be prevented, even if they are only made in\r\nfavour of one of the belligerents.\r\n\r\nThe distinction between loans and subsidies is certainly correct as the\r\nlaw stands at present. But there is no doubt that the fact of\r\nbelligerents having the opportunity of getting loans from subjects of\r\nneutrals is apt to lengthen wars. The Russo-Japanese War, for instance,\r\nwould have come to an end much sooner if either belligerent could have\r\nbeen prevented from borrowing money from subjects of neutrals.\r\nTherefore, what has been said above in § 350 with regard to the supply\r\nof arms and ammunition on the part of subjects of neutrals applies\r\nlikewise to loans: they will no longer be considered lawful when the\r\nstandard of public morality rises.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nSERVICES TO BELLIGERENTS\r\n\r\n  Westlake, II. pp. 219-220--Despagnet, No. 696 _bis_--Bonfils, No.\r\n  1475[1]--Ullmann, § 192--Rivier, II. pp. 388-391--Calvo, IV. §§\r\n  2640-2641--Martens, II. § 134--Perels, § 43--Kleen, I. §§\r\n  103-108--Lawrence, _War_, pp. 83-92, 218-220--Scholz, _Drahtlose\r\n  Telegraphie und Neutralität_ (1905), _passim_, and _Krieg und\r\n  Seekabel_ (1904), pp. 122-133--_Land Warfare_, §§\r\n  481-484--Kebedgy, in _R.I._ 2nd Ser.

Since pilots are in the service of littoral States the question\r\nas to whether neutrals may permit their pilots to render services to\r\nbelligerent men-of-war and transport vessels, is of importance. Article\r\n11[697] of Convention XIII. enacts that \"a neutral Power may allow\r\nbelligerent war-ships to employ its licensed pilots.\" Since, therefore,\r\neverything is left to the discretion of neutrals, they will have to take\r\nthe merits and needs of every case into account. There would certainly\r\nbe no objection to a neutral allowing belligerent vessels to which\r\nasylum is legitimately granted, to be piloted into his ports, and\r\nlikewise such vessels to be piloted through his maritime belt if their\r\npassage is not prohibited. But a belligerent might justly object to the\r\nmen-of-war of his adversary being piloted on the Open Sea by pilots of a\r\nneutral Power, except in a case of distress.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 697: Germany has entered a reservation against article 11.]\r\n\r\nIt is worth mentioning that Great Britain during the Franco-German War\r\nin 1870, prohibited her pilots from conducting German and French\r\nmen-of-war which were outside the maritime belt, except when in\r\ndistress.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Transport on the part of Neutrals.]\r\n\r\n§ 354. It is generally recognised that the duty of impartiality\r\nincumbent upon a neutral obliges him to prevent his men-of-war and other\r\npublic vessels from rendering transport services to either belligerent.\r\nTherefore, such vessels must neither carry soldiers nor sailors\r\nbelonging to belligerent forces, nor their prisoners of war, nor\r\nammunition, military or naval provisions, nor despatches. The question\r\nas to how far such vessels are prevented from carrying enemy subjects\r\nother than members of the forces depends upon the question whether by\r\ncarrying those individuals they render such service to one of the\r\nbelligerents as is detrimental to the other. Thus, when the Dutch\r\nGovernment in 1901, during the South African War, intended to send a\r\nman-of-war, the _Gelderland_, to President Kruger for the purpose of\r\nconveying him to Europe, they made sure in advance that Great Britain\r\ndid not object.\r\n\r\nThe question has been raised[698] as to whether a neutral whose rolling\r\nstock runs on the railway lines of a belligerent, may continue to leave\r\nsuch rolling stock there although it is being used for the transport of\r\ntroops, war material, and the like. The answer, I believe, ought to be\r\nin the negative, for there is no doubt that, if the rolling stock\r\nremains on the railway lines of a belligerent, the neutral concerned is\r\nindirectly rendering transport services to the belligerent. It is for\r\nthis reason that article 19 of Convention V. enacts that railway\r\nmaterial coming from the territory of neutrals shall not be\r\nrequisitioned or used by a belligerent except in the case and to the\r\nextent required by absolute necessity.[699]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 698: See Nowacki, _Die Eisenbahnen im Kriege_ (1906), p. 126.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 699: See below, § 365.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Transport on the part of Neutral Merchantmen and by neutral\r\nrolling stock.]\r\n\r\n§ 355. Just as a neutral is not obliged to prevent his merchantmen from\r\ncarrying contraband, so he is not obliged to prevent them from rendering\r\nservices to belligerents by carrying in the way of trade enemy troops,\r\nand the like, and enemy despatches. Neutral merchantmen rendering such\r\nservices to belligerents do so at their own risk, for these are\r\nunneutral services for which the merchantmen may be punished[700] by the\r\nbelligerents, but for which the neutral State under whose flag such\r\nmerchantmen sail bears no responsibility whatever.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 700: See below, §§ 407-413.]\r\n\r\nAnd the same is valid with regard to rolling stock belonging to private\r\nrailway companies of a neutral State. That such rolling stock may not,\r\nwithout the consent of the companies owning it, be made use of by a\r\nbelligerent for the transport of troops, war material, and the like,\r\nexcept in the case of and to the extent required by absolute necessity,\r\nfollows from article 19 of Convention V. But, if a private railway\r\ncompany gives its consent, and if its rolling stock is made use of for\r\nwarlike purposes, it acquires enemy character, article 19 of Convention\r\nV. does not apply, and the other belligerent may seize and appropriate\r\nit as though it were the property of the enemy State.[701]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 701: See Nowacki, _Die Eisenbahnen im Kriege_ (1906), p. 128.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Information regarding Military and Naval Operations.]\r\n\r\n§ 356. Information regarding military and naval operations may be given\r\nand obtained in so many various ways that several cases must be\r\ndistinguished:--\r\n\r\n(1) It is obvious that the duty of impartiality incumbent upon a neutral\r\nobliges him to prevent his men-of-war from giving any information to a\r\nbelligerent concerning naval operations of the other party. But a\r\nneutral bears no responsibility whatever for private vessels sailing\r\nunder his flag which give such information. Such vessels run, however,\r\nthe risk of being punished for rendering unneutral service.[702]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 702: See below, §§ 409 and 410, and articles 45, Nos. 1 and 2,\r\nand 46, No. 4, of the Declaration of London.]\r\n\r\n(2) It is likewise obvious that his duty of impartiality must prevent a\r\nneutral from giving information concerning the war to a belligerent\r\nthrough his diplomatic envoys, couriers, and the like. But the question\r\nhas been raised as to whether a neutral is obliged to prevent\r\ncouriers[703] from carrying despatches for a belligerent over his\r\nneutral territory. I believe the answer must be in the negative, at\r\nleast so far as those couriers in the service of diplomatic envoys and\r\nsuch agents as carry despatches from a State to its head or to\r\ndiplomatic envoys abroad are concerned. Since they enjoy--as stated\r\nabove, Vol. I. §§ 405 and 457--inviolability for their persons and\r\nofficial papers, a neutral cannot interfere and find out whether these\r\nindividuals carry information to the disadvantage of the enemy.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 703: See Calvo, § 2640.]\r\n\r\n(3) According to article 8 of Convention V. \"a neutral Power is not\r\nbound to forbid or restrict the employment, on behalf of belligerents,\r\nof telegraph or telephone cables, or of wireless telegraphy apparatus\r\nwhether belonging to it, or to companies, or to private individuals.\"\r\nSince, therefore, everything is left to the discretion of the neutral\r\nconcerned, he will have to take the merits and needs of every case into\r\nconsideration, and act accordingly. But so much is certain that a\r\nbelligerent may not categorically request neutrals to forbid or restrict\r\nsuch employment of their telegraph wires and the like on the part of his\r\nadversary.\r\n\r\nThe case is different when a belligerent intends to arrange the\r\ntransmitting of messages through a submarine cable purposely laid over\r\nneutral territory or through telegraph and telephone wires purposely\r\nerected on neutral territory. This would seem to be an abuse of neutral\r\nterritory, and the neutral must prevent it. Accordingly, when in 1870,\r\nduring the Franco-German War, France intended to lay a telegraph cable\r\nfrom Dunkirk to the North of France, the cable to go across the Channel\r\nto England and from there back to France, Great Britain refused her\r\nconsent on account of her neutrality. And again in 1898, during war\r\nbetween Spain and the United States of America, when the latter intended\r\nto land at Hong Kong a cable proposed to be laid from Manila, Great\r\nBritain refused her consent.[704]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 704: See Lawrence, _War_, p. 219.]\r\n\r\nThe case is likewise different when a belligerent intends to erect in a\r\nneutral country, or in a neutral port or neutral waters, a wireless\r\ntelegraphy station or any apparatus intended as a means of communication\r\nwith belligerent forces on land or sea, or to make use of any\r\ninstallation of this kind established by him before the outbreak of war\r\nfor purely military purposes, and not previously opened for the service\r\nof the public generally. According to articles 3 and 5 of Convention V.\r\nand article 5 of Convention XIII., a neutral is bound to prohibit this.\r\nThe case which occurred in 1904, during the Russo-Japanese War and the\r\nsiege of Port Arthur, when the Russians installed an apparatus for\r\nwireless telegraphy in Chifu and communicated thereby with the besieged,\r\nconstituted a violation of neutrality.\r\n\r\n(4) It is obvious that his duty of impartiality must prevent a neutral\r\nfrom allowing belligerents to establish intelligence bureaux on his\r\nterritory. On the other hand, a neutral is not obliged to prevent his\r\nsubjects from giving information to belligerents, be it by letter,\r\ntelegram, telephone, or wireless telegraphy. In especial a neutral is\r\nnot obliged to prevent his subjects from giving information to\r\nbelligerents by wireless telegraphy apparatus installed on a neutral\r\nmerchantman. Such individuals run, however, the risk of being punished\r\nas spies, provided they act clandestinely or under false pretences, and\r\nthe vessel concerned is subject to the risk of being captured and\r\nconfiscated for rendering unneutral service.\r\n\r\nStress must be laid on the fact that newspaper correspondents making use\r\nof wireless telegraphy from on board neutral merchantmen for the purpose\r\nof sending news to their papers,[705] may not be treated as spies, and\r\nthe merchantmen concerned may not be confiscated, although belligerents\r\nneed by no means allow the presence of such vessels at the seat of war.\r\nThus, during the Russo-Japanese War, the _Haimun_, a vessel fitted with\r\na wireless telegraphy apparatus for the service of the _Times_, was\r\nordered away by the Japanese. But, of course, an individual can at the\r\nsame time be a correspondent for a neutral newspaper and a spy, and he\r\nmay then be punished for espionage.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 705: See Lawrence, _War_, pp. 84-88.

Many writers who speak of violation of neutrality treat under\r\nthis head only of violations of the duty of impartiality incumbent upon\r\nneutrals. And indeed such violations only are meant, if one speaks of\r\nviolation of neutrality in the narrower sense of the term. However, it\r\nis necessary for obvious reasons to discuss not only violations of the\r\nduty of impartiality of neutrals, but violations of all duties deriving\r\nfrom neutrality, whether they are incumbent upon neutrals or upon\r\nbelligerents. In the wider sense of the term violation of neutrality\r\ncomprises, therefore, every performance or omission of an act contrary\r\nto the duty of a neutral towards either belligerent as well as contrary\r\nto the duty of either belligerent towards a neutral. Everywhere in this\r\ntreatise the term is used in its wider sense.\r\n\r\nIt is important to remember that violations of neutrality on the part of\r\nbelligerents must not be confounded with violations of the laws of war\r\nby which subjects of neutral States suffer damage. If, for instance, an\r\noccupant levies excessive contributions from subjects of neutral States\r\ndomiciled in enemy country in contravention of article 49 of the Hague\r\nRegulations, this is a violation of the Laws of War, for which,\r\naccording to article 3 of Convention IV., the belligerent concerned\r\nmust pay compensation, but it is not a violation of neutrality.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Violation in contradistinction to End of Neutrality.]\r\n\r\n§ 358. Violation of neutrality must not be confounded with the ending of\r\nneutrality,[706] for neither a violation on the part of a neutral[707]\r\nnor a violation on the part of a belligerent brings _ipso facto_\r\nneutrality to an end. If correctly viewed, the condition of neutrality\r\ncontinues to exist between a neutral and a belligerent in spite of a\r\nviolation of neutrality. It must be emphasised that a violation of\r\nneutrality contains nothing more than a breach of a duty deriving from\r\nthe condition of neutrality. This applies not only to violations of\r\nneutrality by negligence, but also to those by intention. Even in an\r\nextreme case in which the violation of neutrality is so great that the\r\noffended party considers war the only adequate measure in answer to it,\r\nit is not the violation which brings neutrality to an end, but the\r\ndetermination of the offended party. For there is no violation of\r\nneutrality so great as to oblige the offended party to make war in\r\nanswer to it, such party having always the choice whether it will keep\r\nup the condition of neutrality or not.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 706: See above, § 312.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 707: But this is almost everywhere asserted, as the\r\ndistinction between the violation of the duty of impartiality incumbent\r\nupon neutrals on the one hand, and on the other, the ending of\r\nneutrality, is usually not made.]\r\n\r\nBut this applies only to mere violations of neutrality, and not to\r\nhostilities. The latter are acts of war and bring neutrality to an end;\r\nthey have been characterised in contradistinction to mere violations\r\nabove in § 320.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Consequences of Violations of Neutrality.]\r\n\r\n§ 359. Violations of neutrality, whether committed by a neutral against\r\na belligerent or by a belligerent against a neutral, are international\r\ndelinquencies.[708] They may at once be repulsed, the offended party may\r\nrequire the offender to make reparation, and, if this is refused, it may\r\ntake such measures as it thinks adequate to exact the necessary\r\nreparation.[709] If the violation is only slight and unimportant, the\r\noffended State will often merely complain. If, on the other hand, the\r\nviolation is very substantial and grave, the offended State will perhaps\r\nat once declare that it considers itself at war with the offender. In\r\nsuch case it is not the violation of neutrality which brings neutrality\r\nto an end, but the declaration of the offended State that it considers\r\nthe violation of so grave a character as to oblige it to regard itself\r\nat war with the offender.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 708: See above, vol. I. § 151.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 709: See above, vol. I. § 156.]\r\n\r\nThat a violation of neutrality can only, like any other international\r\ndelinquency, be committed by malice or culpable negligence,[710] and\r\nthat it can be committed through a State's refusing to comply with the\r\nconsequences of its \"vicarious\" responsibility for acts of its agents or\r\nsubjects,[711] is a matter of course. Thus, if a belligerent fleet\r\nattacks enemy vessels in neutral territorial waters without an order\r\nfrom its Government, the latter bears \"vicarious\" responsibility for\r\nthis violation of neutral territory on the part of its fleet. If the\r\nGovernment concerned refuses to disown the act of its fleet and to make\r\nthe necessary reparation, this \"vicarious\" responsibility turns into\r\n\"original\" responsibility, for a case of violation of neutrality and an\r\ninternational delinquency has then arisen. And the same is valid if an\r\nagent of a neutral State without an order of his Government commits such\r\nan act as would constitute a violation of neutrality in case it were\r\nordered by the Government; for instance, if the head of a province of a\r\nneutral, without thereto being authorised by his Government, allows\r\nforces of a belligerent to march through this neutral territory.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 710: See above, vol. I. § 154.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 711: See above, vol. I. § 150.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Neutrals not to acquiesce in Violations of Neutrality\r\ncommitted by a Belligerent.]\r\n\r\n§ 360. It is entirely within the discretion of a belligerent whether he\r\nwill acquiesce in a violation of neutrality committed by a neutral in\r\nfavour of the other belligerent. On the other hand, a neutral may not\r\nexercise the same discretion regarding a violation of neutrality\r\ncommitted by one belligerent and detrimental to the other. His duty of\r\nimpartiality rather obliges him in the first instance to prevent, with\r\nthe means at his disposal, the belligerent concerned from committing\r\nsuch violation; for instance, to repulse an attack of men-of-war of a\r\nbelligerent on enemy vessels in neutral ports. Thus article 3 of\r\nConvention XIII. enacts:--\"When a ship has been captured in the\r\nterritorial waters of a neutral Power, such Power must, if the prize is\r\nstill within its jurisdiction, employ the means at its disposal to\r\nrelease the prize with its officers and crew, and to intern the prize\r\ncrew.\" And in case he could not prevent and repulse a violation of his\r\nneutrality, the same duty obliges him to exact due reparation from the\r\noffender,[712] for otherwise he would favour the one party to the\r\ndetriment of the other. If a neutral neglects this obligation, he is\r\nthereby committing a violation of neutrality on his part for which he\r\nmay be made responsible by such belligerent as has suffered through the\r\nviolation of neutrality committed by the other belligerent and\r\nacquiesced in by the neutral. For instance, if belligerent men-of-war\r\nseize enemy vessels in ports of a neutral, and if the neutral, who could\r\nnot or did not prevent this, exacts no reparation from the belligerent\r\nconcerned, the other party may make the neutral responsible for the\r\nlosses sustained.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 712: See articles 25 and 26 of Convention XIII. This duty is\r\nnowadays universally recognised, but before the nineteenth century it\r\ndid not exist, although the rule that belligerents must not commit\r\nhostilities on neutral territory, and in especial in neutral ports and\r\nwaters, was well recognised. That in spite of its recognition this rule\r\nwas in the eighteenth century frequently infringed by commanders of\r\nbelligerent fleets, may be illustrated by many cases. Thus, for\r\ninstance, in 1793, the French frigate _Modeste_ was captured in the\r\nharbour of Genoa by two British men-of-war (see Hall, § 220). And in\r\n1801, during war against Sweden, a British frigate captured the _Freden_\r\nand three other Swedish vessels in the Norwegian harbour of Oster-Risoer\r\n(see Ortolan, II. pp. 413-418).]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Case of the _General Armstrong_.]\r\n\r\n§ 361. Some writers[713] maintain that a neutral is freed from\r\nresponsibility for a violation of neutrality through a belligerent\r\nattacking enemy forces in neutral territory, in case the attacked\r\nforces, instead of trusting for protection or redress to the neutral,\r\ndefend themselves against the attack. This rule is adopted from the\r\narbitral award in the case of the _General Armstrong_. In 1814, during\r\nwar between Great Britain and the United States of America, the American\r\nprivateer _General Armstrong_, lying in the harbour of Fayal, an island\r\nbelonging to the Portuguese Azores, defended herself against an attack\r\nof an English squadron, but was nevertheless captured. The United States\r\nclaimed damages from Portugal because the privateer was captured in a\r\nneutral Portuguese port. Negotiations went on for many years, and the\r\nparties finally agreed in 1851 upon arbitration to be given by Louis\r\nNapoleon, then President of the French Republic. In 1852 Napoleon gave\r\nhis award in favour of Portugal, maintaining that, although the attack\r\non the privateer in neutral waters comprised a violation of neutrality,\r\nPortugal could not be made responsible, on account of the fact that the\r\nattacked privateer chose to defend herself instead of demanding\r\nprotection from the Portuguese authorities.[714] It is, however, not at\r\nall certain that the rule laid down in this award will find general\r\nrecognition in theory and practice.[715]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 713: See, for instance, Hall, § 228, and Geffcken in\r\nHoltzendorff, IV. p. 701.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 714: See Moore, _Arbitrations_, II. pp. 1071-1132; Calvo, IV.\r\n§ 2662; and Dana's note 208 in Wheaton, § 429.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 715: The case of the _Reshitelni_, which occurred in 1904,\r\nduring the Russo-Japanese War, and is somewhat similar to that of the\r\n_General Armstrong_, is discussed above in § 320 (2). That no violation\r\nof neutrality took place in the case of the _Variag_ and _Korietz_, is\r\nshown above in § 320 (1).]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mode of exacting Reparation from Belligerents for Violations\r\nof Neutrality.]\r\n\r\n§ 362. It is obvious that the duty of a neutral not to acquiesce in\r\nviolations of neutrality committed by one belligerent to the detriment\r\nof the other obliges him to repair, so far as he can, the result of such\r\nwrongful acts. Thus, he must liberate[716] a prize taken in his neutral\r\nwaters, or prisoners made on his territory, and the like. In so far,\r\nhowever, as he cannot, or not sufficiently, undo the wrong done, he must\r\nexact reparation from the offender. Now, no general rule can be laid\r\ndown regarding the mode of exacting such reparation, since everything\r\ndepends upon the merits of the individual case. Only as regards capture\r\nof enemy vessels in neutral waters has a practice grown up, which must\r\nbe considered binding, and according to which the neutral must claim the\r\nprize, and eventually damages, from the belligerent concerned, and must\r\nrestore her to the other party. Thus in 1800, during war between Great\r\nBritain and the Netherlands, Prussia claimed before the British Prize\r\nCourt the _Twee Gebroeders_,[717] a Dutch vessel captured by the British\r\ncruiser _L'Espiègle_ in the neutral maritime belt of Prussia. Sir\r\nWilliam Scott ordered restoration of the vessel, yet he refused costs\r\nand damages, because the captor had not violated Prussian neutrality\r\nintentionally but only by mistake and misapprehension. Thus again, in\r\n1805, during war between Great Britain and Spain, the United States\r\nclaimed before the British Prize Court the _Anna_,[718] a Spanish vessel\r\ncaptured by the English privateer _Minerva_ within their neutral\r\nmaritime belt. Thus, further, in 1864, during the American Civil War,\r\nwhen the Confederate cruiser _Florida_ was captured by the Federal\r\ncruiser _Wachuset_ in the neutral Brazilian port of Bahia, Brazil\r\nclaimed the prize. As the latter had sunk while at anchor in Hampton\r\nRoads, she could not be restored, but the United States expiated the\r\nviolation of neutrality committed by her cruiser by court-martialing\r\nthe commander; further, by dismissing her Consul at Bahia for having\r\nadvised the capture; and, finally, by sending a man-of-war to the spot\r\nwhere the violation of neutrality had taken place for the special\r\npurpose of delivering a solemn salute to the Brazilian flag.[719]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 716: See article 3 of Convention XIII.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 717: 3 C. Rob. 162.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 718: 5 C. Rob. 373. See above, vol. I. § 234.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 719: See Moore, VII. § 1334, p. 1090.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Negligence on the part of Neutrals.]\r\n\r\n§ 363. Apart from intentional violations of neutrality, a neutral can be\r\nmade responsible only for such acts favouring or damaging a belligerent\r\nas he could by due diligence have prevented, and which by culpable\r\nnegligence he failed to prevent. It is by no means obligatory for a\r\nneutral to prevent such acts under all circumstances and conditions.\r\nThis is in fact impossible, and it becomes more obviously so the larger\r\na neutral State, and the longer its boundary lines. So long as a neutral\r\nexercises due diligence for the purpose of preventing such acts, he is\r\nnot responsible in case they are nevertheless performed. However, the\r\nterm _due diligence_ has become controversial through the definition\r\nproffered by the United States of America in interpreting the Three\r\nRules of Washington, and through the Geneva Court of Arbitration\r\nadopting such interpretation.[720] According to this interpretation the\r\n_due diligence_ of a neutral _must be in proportion to the risks to\r\nwhich either belligerent may be exposed from failure to fulfil the\r\nobligations of neutrality on his part_. Had this interpretation been\r\ngenerally accepted, the most oppressive obligations would have become\r\nincumbent upon neutrals. But no such general acceptance has taken place.\r\nThe fact is that _due diligence_ in International Law can have no other\r\nmeaning than it has in Municipal Law. It means _such diligence as can\r\nreasonably be expected when all the circumstances and conditions of the\r\ncase are taken into consideration_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 720: See above, § 335.]\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, the Second Peace Conference has taken a step which\r\ncertainly excludes for the future the continuation of the controversy\r\nregarding the interpretation of _due diligence_, for articles 8 and 25\r\nof Convention XIII., instead of stipulating due diligence on the part of\r\nneutrals, stipulate _the employment of the means at their disposal_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Laying of Submarine Contact Mines by Neutrals.]\r\n\r\n§ 363_a_. In order to defend themselves against possible violations of\r\ntheir neutral territory, neutrals may lay automatic contact mines off\r\ntheir coasts. If they do this, they must, according to article 4 of\r\nConvention VIII., observe the same rules and take the same precautions\r\nas are imposed upon belligerents, and as have been expounded above, §\r\n182_a_. Moreover they must, according to paragraph 2 of article 4 of\r\nConvention VIII., give notice in advance to mariners of the place where\r\nautomatic contact mines have been laid, and this notice must be\r\ncommunicated at once to the Governments through the diplomatic channels.\r\n\r\nConvention VIII. is quite as unsatisfactory in its rules concerning\r\nmines laid by neutrals as in its rules concerning mines laid by\r\nbelligerents, and the danger to neutral shipping created by mines laid\r\nby neutrals is very great, all the more as the laying of mines by\r\nneutrals is not restricted to their maritime belt. For article 4 of\r\nConvention VIII. speaks of the laying of contact mines on the part of\r\nneutral Powers _off their coasts_, without limiting the laying within\r\nthe three-mile wide maritime belt as was proposed at the Second Peace\r\nConference, and as article 6[721] of the _Règlementation internationale\r\nde l'Usage des Mines sous-marines et torpilles_ of the Institute of\r\nInternational Law likewise proposes.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 721: See _Annuaire_, XXIV.

Under the term _jus angariae_[722] many writers on International\r\nLaw place the right, often claimed and practised in former times, of a\r\nbelligerent deficient in vessels to lay an _embargo_ on and seize\r\nneutral merchantmen in his harbours, and to compel them and their crews\r\nto transport troops, ammunition, and provisions to certain places on\r\npayment of freight in advance.[723] This practice arose in the Middle\r\nAges,[724] and was made much use of by Louis XIV. of France. To save the\r\nvessels of their subjects from seizure under the right of angary, States\r\nbegan in the seventeenth century to conclude treaties by which they\r\nrenounced such right with regard to each other's vessels. Thereby the\r\nright came into disuse during the eighteenth century. Many writers[725]\r\nassert, nevertheless, that it is not obsolete, and might be exercised\r\neven to-day. But I doubt whether the Powers would concede to one another\r\nthe exercise of such a right. The facts that no case happened in the\r\nnineteenth century and that International Law with regard to rights and\r\nduties of neutrals has become much more developed during the eighteenth\r\nand nineteenth centuries, would seem to justify the opinion that such\r\nangary is now probably obsolete,[726] although some writers[727] deny\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 722: The term _angaria_, which in medieval Latin means _post\r\nstation_, is a derivation from the Greek term ἄγγαρος for\r\nmessenger. _Jus angariae_ would therefore literally mean a right of\r\ntransport.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 723: See above, § 40.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 724: On the origin and development of the _jus angariae_, see\r\nAlbrecht, _op. cit._ pp. 24-37.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 725: See, for instance, Phillimore, III. § 29; Calvo, III. §\r\n1277; Heffter, § 150; Perels, § 40.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 726: See Article 39 of the \"Règlement sur le régime légal des\r\nnavires ... dans les ports étrangers\" adopted by the Institute of\r\nInternational Law (_Annuaire_, XVII. 1898, p. 272): \"Le droit d'angarie\r\nest supprimé, soit en temps de paix, soit en temps de guerre, quant aux\r\nnavires neutres.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 727: See Albrecht, _op. cit._ pp. 34-37.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Modern Right of Angary.]\r\n\r\n§ 365. In contradistinction to this probably obsolete right to compel\r\nneutral ships and their crews to render certain services, the modern\r\nright of angary consists in the right of belligerents to make use of, or\r\ndestroy in case of necessity, _for the purpose of offence and defence_,\r\nneutral property on their own or on enemy territory or on the Open Sea.\r\nIn case property of subjects of neutral States is vested with enemy\r\ncharacter,[728] it is not neutral property in the strict sense of the\r\nterm neutral, and all rules respecting appropriation, utilisation, and\r\ndestruction of enemy property obviously apply to it. The object of the\r\nright of angary is _such property of subjects of neutral States as\r\nretains its neutral character from its temporary position on belligerent\r\nterritory and which therefore is not vested with enemy character_. All\r\nsorts of neutral property, whether it consists of vessels or other[729]\r\nmeans of transport, or arms, ammunition, provisions, or other personal\r\nproperty, may be the object of the right of angary, provided the\r\narticles concerned are serviceable to military ends and wants. The\r\nconditions under which the right may be exercised are the same as those\r\nunder which private enemy property may be utilised or destroyed, but in\r\nevery case the neutral owner must be fully indemnified.[730]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 728: See above, § 90.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 729: Thus in 1870, during the Franco-German War, the Germans\r\nseized hundreds of Swiss and Austrian railway carriages in France and\r\nmade use of them for military purposes.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 730: See article 6 of U.S. Naval War Code:--\"If military\r\nnecessity should require it, neutral vessels found within the limits of\r\nbelligerent authority may be seized and destroyed, or otherwise used for\r\nmilitary purposes, but in such cases the owners of the neutral vessels\r\nmust be fully recompensed. The amount of the indemnity should, if\r\npracticable, be agreed upon in advance with the owner or master of the\r\nvessel; due regard must be had for treaty stipulations upon these\r\nmatters.\" See also Holland, _War_, No. 140.]\r\n\r\nA remarkable case[731] happened in 1871 during the Franco-German War.\r\nThe Germans seized some British coal-vessels lying in the river Seine at\r\nDuclair, and sank them for the purpose of preventing French gunboats\r\nfrom running up the river. On the intervention of the British\r\nGovernment, Count Bismarck refused to recognise the duty of Germany to\r\nindemnify the owners of the vessels sunk, although he agreed to pay\r\nindemnities.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 731: See Albrecht, _op. cit._ pp. 45-48.]\r\n\r\nHowever, it may safely be maintained that a duty to pay indemnities for\r\nany damage done by exercising the right of angary must nowadays be\r\nrecognised. Article 53 of the Hague Regulations stipulates the payment\r\nof indemnities for the seizure and utilisation of all appliances adapted\r\nto the transport of persons or goods which are the private property of\r\ninhabitants of occupied enemy territory, and article 52 of the Hague\r\nRegulations stipulates payment for requisitions; if, thus, the immunity\r\nfrom confiscation of private property of inhabitants is recognised, all\r\nthe more must that of private neutral property temporarily on occupied\r\nenemy territory be recognised also.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Right of Angary concerning Neutral Rolling Stock.]\r\n\r\n§ 366. A special case of the right of angary has found recognition by\r\narticle 19 of Convention V. of the Second Peace Conference enacting that\r\nrailway material coming from the territory of a neutral Power, whether\r\nbelonging to the neutral State or to companies or private persons, shall\r\nnot be requisitioned or utilised by a belligerent, _except in the case\r\nof and to the extent required by absolute necessity_, that it shall as\r\nsoon as possible be sent back to the country of origin, and that\r\ncompensation shall be paid for its use.[732] But it must be mentioned\r\nthat article 19 gives a right to a neutral Power, whose railway\r\nmaterial has been requisitioned by a belligerent, to retain and make use\r\nof, to a corresponding extent, railway material coming from the\r\nterritory of the belligerent concerned.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 732: See Nowacki, _Die Eisenbahnen im Kriege_ (1906), pp.\r\n115-126, and Albrecht, _op. cit._ pp. 22-24.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Right of Angary not deriving from Neutrality.]\r\n\r\n§ 367. Whatever the extent of the right of angary may be, it does not\r\nderive from the law of neutrality. The correlative duty of a belligerent\r\nto indemnify the neutral owner of property appropriated or destroyed by\r\nthe exercise of the right of angary does indeed derive from the law of\r\nneutrality. But the right of angary itself is rather a right deriving\r\nfrom the law of war. As a rule this law gives, under certain\r\ncircumstances and conditions, the right to a belligerent to seize, make\r\nuse of, or destroy private property of inhabitants only of occupied\r\nenemy territory, but under other circumstances and conditions, and very\r\nexceptionally, it likewise gives a belligerent the right to seize, use,\r\nor destroy such neutral property as is temporarily on occupied enemy\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nBLOCKADE\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nCONCEPTION OF BLOCKADE\r\n\r\n  Grotius, III. c. 1, § 5--Bynkershoek, _Quaest. jur. publ._ I. c.\r\n  2-15--Vattel, III. § 117--Hall, §§ 233, 237-266--Lawrence, §§\r\n  246-252--Westlake, II. pp. 228-239--Maine, pp. 107-109--Manning,\r\n  pp. 400-412--Phillimore, III. §§ 285-321--Twiss, II. §§\r\n  98-120--Halleck, II. pp. 182-213--Taylor, §§ 674-684--Walker, §§\r\n  76-82--Wharton, III. §§ 359-365--Moore, VII. §§\r\n  1266-1286--Wheaton, §§ 509-523--Bluntschli, §§ 827-840--Heffter,\r\n  §§ 154-157--Geffcken in Holtzendorff, IV. pp. 738-771--Ullmann, §\r\n  182--Bonfils, Nos. 1608-1659--Despagnet, Nos.\r\n  620-640--Pradier-Fodéré, VI.

Blockade is the blocking by men-of-war[733] of the approach to\r\nthe enemy coast or a part of it for the purpose of preventing ingress\r\nand egress of vessels of all nations. Blockade must not be confounded\r\nwith siege, although it may take place concurrently with siege. Whereas\r\nsiege aims at the capture of the besieged place, blockade endeavours\r\nmerely to intercept all intercourse, and especially commercial\r\nintercourse, by sea between the coast and the world at large. Although\r\nblockade is, as shown above in §§ 173 and 174, a means of warfare\r\nagainst the enemy, it concerns neutrals as well, because the ingress and\r\negress of neutral vessels are thereby interdicted and may be punished.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 733: When in 1861, during the American Civil War, the Federal\r\nGovernment blocked the harbour of Charleston by sinking ships laden with\r\nstone, the question arose whether a so-called stone-blockade is lawful.\r\nThere ought to be no doubt--see below, § 380--that such a stone-blockade\r\nis not a blockade in the ordinary sense of the term, and that neutral\r\nships may not be seized and confiscated for having attempted egress or\r\ningress. But, on the other hand, there ought to be no doubt either that\r\nthis mode of obstructing an enemy port is as lawful as any other means\r\nof sea warfare, provided the blocking of the harbour is made known so\r\nthat neutral vessels can avoid the danger of being wrecked. See Wharton,\r\nIII. § 361A; Fauchille, _Blocus_, pp. 143-145; Perels, § 35, p. 187.]\r\n\r\nBlockade in the modern sense of the term is an institution which could\r\nnot develop until neutrality was in some form a recognised institution\r\nof the Law of Nations, and until the freedom of neutral commerce was in\r\nsome form guaranteed. The institution of blockade dates from the\r\nsixteenth century,[734] but it has taken several hundred years for the\r\ninstitution to reach its present condition, since, until the beginning\r\nof the nineteenth century, belligerents frequently made use of so-called\r\npaper blockades, which are no longer valid, a blockade now being binding\r\nonly if effective.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 734: See Fauchille, _Blocus_, pp. 2-6.]\r\n\r\nIt is on account of the practical importance of blockade for the\r\ninterests of neutrals that the matter is more conveniently treated with\r\nneutrality than with war. And it must be noted that blockade as a means\r\nof warfare must not be confounded with so-called pacific blockade, which\r\nis a means of compulsive settlement of State differences.\r\n\r\nApart from the stipulation of the Declaration of Paris that a blockade\r\nto be binding must be effective, no conventional rules concerning\r\nblockade were in existence until the Declaration of London, nor was the\r\npractice of the States governed by common rules covering all the points\r\nconcerned. But articles 1-21 of the Declaration of London now offer a\r\ncode of the law of blockade and will, should this Declaration be\r\nratified, in time produce a common practice of all maritime States.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Blockade, Strategic and Commercial.]\r\n\r\n§ 369. A blockade is termed strategic if it forms part of other military\r\noperations directed against the coast which is blockaded, or if it be\r\ndeclared in order to cut off supply to enemy forces on shore. In\r\ncontradistinction to blockade strategic, one speaks of a commercial\r\nblockade, when a blockade is declared simply in order to cut off the\r\ncoast from intercourse with the outside world, although no military\r\noperations take place on shore. That blockades commercial are, according\r\nto the present rules of International Law, as legitimate as blockades\r\nstrategic, is not generally denied. But several writers[735] maintain\r\nthat blockades purely commercial ought to be abolished as not in\r\naccordance with the guaranteed freedom of neutral commerce during war.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 735: See Hall, § 233.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Blockade to be Universal.]\r\n\r\n§ 370. A blockade is really in being when vessels of all nations are\r\ninterdicted and prevented from ingress or egress. Blockade as a means of\r\nwarfare is admissible only in the form of a _universal_ blockade, that\r\nis--as article 5 of the Declaration of London stipulates--it \"must be\r\napplied impartially to the vessels of all nations.\" If the blockading\r\nbelligerent were to allow the ingress or egress of vessels of one\r\nnation, no blockade would exist.[736]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 736: The _Rolla_ (1807), 6 C. Rob. 364; the _Franciska_\r\n(1855), Spinks, 287. See also below, § 382.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, provided a blockade is universal, a special licence\r\nof ingress or egress may be given to a special vessel and for a\r\nparticular purpose,[737] and men-of-war of all neutral nations may be\r\nallowed to pass to and fro unhindered.[738] Thus, when during the\r\nAmerican Civil War the Federal Government blockaded the coast of the\r\nConfederate States, neutral men-of-war were not prevented from ingress\r\nand egress. But it must be specially observed that a belligerent has a\r\nright to prevent neutral men-of-war from passing through the line of\r\nblockade, and it is entirely within his discretion whether or not he\r\nwill admit or exclude them; nor is he compelled to admit them all, even\r\nthough he has admitted one or more of them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 737: This exception to the general rule is not mentioned by\r\nthe Declaration of London, but I have no doubt that the International\r\nPrize Court would recognise it.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 738: Recognised by article 6 of the Declaration of London.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Blockade, Outwards and Inwards.]\r\n\r\n§ 371. As a rule a blockade is declared for the purpose of preventing\r\ningress as well as egress. But sometimes only ingress or only egress is\r\nprevented. In such cases one speaks of \"Blockade inwards\" and of\r\n\"Blockade outwards\" respectively. Thus the blockade of the mouth of the\r\nDanube declared by the Allies in 1854 during the Crimean War was a\r\n\"blockade inwards,\" since the only purpose was to prevent supply\r\nreaching the Russian Army from the sea.[739]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 739: The _Gerasimo_ (1857), 11 Moore, P.C. 88.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: What Places can be Blockaded.]\r\n\r\n§ 372. In former times it was sometimes asserted that only ports, or\r\neven only fortified[740] ports, could be blockaded, but the practice of\r\nthe States has always shown that single ports and portions of an enemy\r\ncoast as well as the whole of the enemy coast may be blockaded. Thus\r\nduring the American Civil War the whole of the coast of the Confederate\r\nStates to the extent of about 2500 nautical miles was blockaded. And\r\nattention must be drawn to the fact, that such ports of a belligerent\r\nas are in the hands of the enemy may be the object of a blockade. Thus\r\nduring the Franco-German War the French blockaded[741] their own ports\r\nof Rouen, Dieppe, and Fécamp, which were occupied by the Germans.\r\nArticle 1 of the Declaration of London indirectly sanctions the practice\r\nof the States by enacting that \"a blockade must not extend beyond the\r\nports and coasts belonging to or occupied by the enemy.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 740: Napoleon I. maintained in his Berlin Decrees: \"Le droit\r\nde blocus, d'après la raison et l'usage de tous les peuples policés,\r\nn'est applicable qu'aux places fortes.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 741: See Fauchille, _Blocus_, p. 161.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Blockade of International Rivers.]\r\n\r\n§ 373. It is a moot question whether the mouth of a so-called\r\ninternational river may be the object of a blockade, in case the\r\nriparian States are not all belligerents. Thus, when in 1854, during the\r\nCrimean War, the allied fleets of Great Britain and France blockaded the\r\nmouth of the Danube, Bavaria and Württemberg, which remained neutral,\r\nprotested. When in 1870 the French blockaded the whole of the German\r\ncoast of the North Sea, they exempted the mouth of the river Ems,\r\nbecause it runs partly through Holland. And when in 1863, during the\r\nblockade of the coast of the Confederate States, the Federal cruiser\r\n_Vanderbilt_ captured the British vessel _Peterhoff_[742] destined for\r\nMatamaros, on the Mexican shore of the Rio Grande, the American Courts\r\nreleased the vessel on the ground that trade with Mexico, which was\r\nneutral, could not be prohibited.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 742: 5 Wallace, 49. See Fauchille, _Blocus_, pp. 171-183;\r\nPhillimore, III. § 293A; Hall, § 266; Rivier, II. p. 291.]\r\n\r\nThe Declaration of London would seem to settle the controversy only as\r\nregards one point. By enacting that \"the blockading forces must not bar\r\naccess to neutral ports or coasts,\" article 18 certainly prohibits the\r\nblockade of the whole mouth of a boundary river between a neutral and a\r\nbelligerent State, as, for instance, the River Rio Grande in case of war\r\nwith the United States of America, provided Mexico remained neutral. But\r\nno provision is made for the case of the blockade of the mouths of\r\nrivers, such as the Danube or the Rhine, for example, which pass through\r\nseveral States between their sources and their mouths at the sea coast,\r\nif one or more upper riparian States remain neutral.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Justification of Blockade.]\r\n\r\n§ 374. The question has been raised in what way blockade, which vests a\r\nbelligerent with a certain jurisdiction over neutral vessels and which\r\nhas detrimental consequences for neutral trade, could be justified.[743]\r\nSeveral writers, following Hautefeuille,[744] maintain that the\r\nestablishment of a blockade by a belligerent stationing a number of\r\nmen-of-war so as to block the approach to the coast includes conquest of\r\nthat part of the sea, and that such conquest justifies a belligerent in\r\nprohibiting ingress and egress of vessels of all nations. In\r\ncontradistinction to this artificial construction of a conquest of a\r\npart of the sea, some writers[745] try to justify blockade by the\r\nnecessity of war. I think, however, no special justification of blockade\r\nis necessary at all. The fact is that the detrimental consequences of\r\nblockade to neutrals stand in the same category as the many other\r\ndetrimental consequences of war to neutrals. Neither the one nor the\r\nother need be specially justified. A blockade interferes indeed with the\r\nrecognised principle of the freedom of the sea, and, further, with the\r\nrecognised freedom of neutral commerce. But all three have developed\r\ntogether, and when the freedom of the sea in time of peace and war, and,\r\nfurther, when the freedom of neutral commerce became generally\r\nrecognised, the exceptional restrictions of blockade became at the same\r\ntime recognised as legitimate.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 743: The matter is thoroughly treated by Fauchille, _Blocus_,\r\npp. 13-36, and Güldenagel, _op. cit._ pp. 39-86.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 744: See Hautefeuille, II. pp. 190-191.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 745: See Gessner, p. 151; Bluntschli, § 827; Martens, II. §\r\n124.]\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nESTABLISHMENT OF BLOCKADE\r\n\r\n  See the literature quoted above at the commencement of § 368.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Competence to establish Blockade.]\r\n\r\n§ 375. A declaration of blockade being \"a high[746] act of sovereignty\"\r\nand having far-reaching consequences upon neutral trade, it is generally\r\nrecognised not to be in the discretion of a commander of a naval force\r\nto establish blockade without the authority of his Government. Article 9\r\nof the Declaration of London precisely enacts that \"a Declaration of\r\nblockade is made by the blockading Power or by the naval authorities\r\nacting in its name.\" The authority of his Government to establish a\r\nblockade can be granted to a commander of a naval force purposely for a\r\nparticular blockade, the Government ordering the commander of a squadron\r\nto blockade a certain port or coast. Or a Government can expressly\r\ndelegate its power to blockade to a commander for use at his discretion.\r\nAnd if operations of war take place at great distance[747] from the seat\r\nof Government and a commander finds it necessary to establish a\r\nblockade, the latter can become valid through his Government giving its\r\nimmediate consent after being informed of the act of the commander. And,\r\nfurther, the powers vested in the hands of the supreme commander of a\r\nfleet are supposed to include the authority to establish a blockade in\r\ncase he finds it necessary, provided that his Government acquiesces as\r\nsoon as it is informed of the establishment of the blockade.[748]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 746: The _Henrik_ and _Maria_ (1799), 1 C. Rob. 146.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 747: The _Rolla_ (1807), 6 C. Rob. 364.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 748: As regards the whole matter, see Fauchille, _Blocus_, pp.\r\n68-73.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Declaration and Notification of Blockade.]\r\n\r\n§ 376. A blockade is not in being _ipso facto_ by the outbreak of war.\r\nAnd even the actual blocking of the approach to an enemy coast by\r\nbelligerent men-of-war need not by itself mean that the ingress and\r\negress of _neutral_ vessels are to be prohibited, since it can take\r\nplace for the purpose of preventing the egress and ingress of _enemy_\r\nvessels only. Continental writers, therefore, have always considered\r\nnotification to be essential for the establishment of a blockade.\r\nEnglish, American, and Japanese writers, however, have not hitherto held\r\nnotification to be essential, although they considered knowledge on the\r\npart of a neutral vessel of an existing blockade to be necessary for her\r\ncondemnation for breach of blockade.[749]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 749: See below, § 384.]\r\n\r\nBut although Continental writers have always held notification to be\r\nessential for the establishment of blockade, they differed with regard\r\nto the kind of notification that is necessary. Some writers[750]\r\nmaintained that three different notifications must take place--namely,\r\nfirst, a local notification to the authorities of the blockaded ports or\r\ncoast; secondly, a diplomatic or general notification to all maritime\r\nneutral States by the blockading belligerent; and, thirdly, a special\r\nnotification to every approaching neutral vessel. Other writers[751]\r\nconsidered only diplomatic and special notification essential. Others\r\nagain[752] maintained that special notification to every approaching\r\nneutral vessel is alone required, although they recommended diplomatic\r\nnotification as a matter of courtesy.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 750: See, for instance, Kleen, I. § 131.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 751: See, for instance, Bluntschli, 831-832; Martens, II. §\r\n124, Gessner, p. 181.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 752: See, for instance, Hautefeuille, II. pp. 224 and 226;\r\nCalvo, V. § 2846; Fauchille, pp. 219-221.]\r\n\r\nAs regards the practice of States, it has always been usual for the\r\ncommander who established a blockade to send a notification of the\r\nblockade to the authorities of the blockaded ports or coast and the\r\nforeign consuls there. It has, further, always been usual for the\r\nblockading Government to notify the fact diplomatically to all neutral\r\nmaritime States. And some States, as France and Italy, have always\r\nordered their blockading men-of-war to board every approaching neutral\r\nvessel and notify her of the establishment of the blockade. But Great\r\nBritain, the United States of America, and Japan did not formerly\r\nconsider notification to be essential for the institution of a blockade.\r\nThey held the simple fact that the approach was blocked, and egress and\r\ningress of neutral vessels actually prevented, to be sufficient to make\r\nthe existence of a blockade known, and when no diplomatic notification\r\nhad taken place, they did not seize a vessel for breach of blockade\r\nwhose master had no actual notice of the existence of the blockade.\r\nEnglish,[753] American,[754] and Japanese[755] practice, accordingly,\r\nmade a distinction between a so-called _de facto_ blockade on the one\r\nhand, and, on the other, a notified blockade.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 753: The _Vrouw Judith_ (1799), 1 C. Rob. 150.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 754: See U.S. Naval War Code, articles 39-40.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 755: See Japanese Prize Law, article 30.]\r\n\r\nThe Declaration of London, when ratified, will create a common practice,\r\nfor articles 8 to 12 represent an agreement of the Powers on the\r\nfollowing points:--\r\n\r\n(1) There must be a _declaration_ as well as a _notification_ in order\r\nto make a blockade binding (article 8). If there is either no proper\r\ndeclaration or no proper notification, the blockade is not binding.\r\n\r\n(2) A _declaration_ of blockade is made either by the blockading Power\r\nor by the naval authorities acting in its name. The declaration of\r\nblockade must specify (_a_) the date when the blockade begins; (_b_) the\r\ngeographical limits of the coastline under blockade; and (_c_) the\r\nperiod within which neutral vessels may come out (article 9). If the\r\ncommencement of the blockade or its geographical limits are given\r\ninaccurately in the declaration, or if no mention is made of the period\r\nwithin which neutral vessels may come out, or if this period is given\r\ninaccurately, the declaration is void, and a new declaration is\r\nnecessary in order to make the blockade binding (article 10).\r\n\r\n(3) _Notification_ of the declaration of blockade must at once be made.\r\nTwo notifications are necessary (article 11):--\r\n\r\nThe first notification must be made by the Government of the blockading\r\nfleet to all neutral Governments either through the diplomatic channel,\r\nor otherwise, for instance by telegraph. The purpose of this\r\nnotification is to enable neutral Governments to inform merchantmen\r\nsailing under their flag of the establishment of a blockade.\r\n\r\nThe second notification must be made to the local authorities by the\r\nofficer commanding the blockading force; these authorities have on their\r\npart to notify, as soon as possible, the foreign consuls at the\r\nblockaded port or coastline. The purpose of this notification is to\r\nenable neutral merchantmen in the blockaded port or ports to receive\r\nknowledge of the establishment of the blockade and to prepare themselves\r\nto leave the port within the period specified in the declaration of\r\nblockade.\r\n\r\n(4) The rules as to declaration and notification of blockade apply to\r\ncases where the limits of a blockade have been extended, or where a\r\nblockade is re-established after having been raised (article 12).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Length of Time for Egress of Neutral Vessels.]\r\n\r\n§ 377. As regards _ingress_, a blockade becomes valid the moment it is\r\nestablished; even vessels in ballast have no right of ingress. As\r\nregards _egress_, it has always been usual for the blockading commander\r\nto grant a certain length of time within which neutral vessels might\r\nleave the blockaded ports unhindered, but no rule existed respecting the\r\nlength of such time, although fifteen days were frequently\r\ngranted.[756] This usage of granting to neutral vessels a period within\r\nwhich they may leave the blockaded port, has been made a binding rule by\r\nthe Declaration of London. For, since article 9 enacts that a\r\ndeclaration of blockade must specify the period within which neutral\r\nvessels may come out, it implicitly enacts that the granting of such a\r\nperiod is compulsory, although it may only be long enough to enable\r\nneutral vessels to make their way out as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 756: According to U.S. Naval War Code, article 43, thirty days\r\nare allowed \"unless otherwise specially ordered.\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: End of Blockade.]\r\n\r\n§ 378. Apart from the conclusion of peace, a blockade can come to an end\r\nin three different ways.\r\n\r\nIt may, firstly, be raised, or restricted in its limits, by the\r\nblockading Power for any reason it likes. In such a case it has always\r\nbeen usual to notify the end of blockade to all neutral maritime States,\r\nand article 13 of the Declaration of London turns this usage into a\r\nbinding rule by enacting that the voluntary raising of a blockade, as\r\nalso any restrictions in its limits, must, in the same way as the\r\ndeclaration of a blockade, be notified to all neutral Governments by the\r\nblockading Power, as well as to the local authorities by the officer\r\ncommanding the blockading fleet.\r\n\r\nA blockade can, secondly, come to an end through an enemy force driving\r\noff the blockading squadron or fleet. In such case the blockade ends\r\n_ipso facto_ by the blockading squadron being driven away, whatever\r\ntheir intention as to returning may be. Should the squadron return and\r\nresume the blockade, it must be considered as new, and not simply the\r\ncontinuation of the former blockade, and another declaration and\r\nnotification are necessary (article 12 of the Declaration of London).\r\n\r\nThe third ground for the ending of a blockade is its failure to be\r\neffective, a point which will be treated below in § 382.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nEFFECTIVENESS OF BLOCKADE\r\n\r\n  See the literature quoted above at the commencement of § 368.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effective in contradistinction to Fictitious Blockade.]\r\n\r\n§ 379. The necessity for effectiveness in a blockade by means of the\r\npresence of a blockading squadron of sufficient strength to prevent\r\negress and ingress of vessels became gradually recognised during the\r\nfirst half of the nineteenth century; it became formally enacted as a\r\nprinciple of the Law of Nations through the Declaration of Paris in\r\n1856, and the Declaration of London enacts it by article 2. Effective\r\nblockade is the contrast to so-called fictitious or paper blockade,\r\nwhich was frequently practised during the seventeenth, eighteenth, and\r\nat the beginning of the nineteenth century.[757] Fictitious blockade\r\nconsists in the declaration and notification that a port or a coast is\r\nblockaded without, however, posting a sufficient number of men-of-war on\r\nthe spot to be really able to prevent egress and ingress of every\r\nvessel. It was one of the principles of the First and of the Second\r\nArmed Neutrality that a blockade should always be effective, but it was\r\nnot till after the Napoleonic wars that this principle gradually found\r\nuniversal recognition. During the second half of the nineteenth century\r\neven those States which had not acceded to the Declaration of Paris did\r\nnot dissent regarding the necessity for effectiveness of blockade.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 757: See Fauchille, _Blocus_, pp. 74-109.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Condition of Effectiveness of Blockade.]\r\n\r\n§ 380. The condition of effectiveness of blockade, as defined by the\r\nDeclaration of Paris, is its maintenance _by such a force as is\r\nsufficient really to prevent access to the coast_. But no unanimity\r\nexists respecting what is required to constitute an effective blockade\r\naccording to this definition. Apart from differences of opinion\r\nregarding points of minor interest, it may be stated that in the main\r\nthere are two conflicting opinions.\r\n\r\nAccording to one opinion, the definition of an effective blockade\r\npronounced by the First Armed Neutrality of 1780 is valid, and a\r\nblockade is effective only when the approach to the coast is barred by a\r\nchain of men-of-war anchored on the spot and so near to one another that\r\nthe line cannot be passed without obvious danger to the passing\r\nvessel.[758] This corresponds to the practice hitherto followed by\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 758: See Hautefeuille, II. p. 194; Gessner, p. 179; Kleen, I.\r\n§ 129; Boeck, Nos. 676-681; Dupuis, Nos. 173-174; Fauchille, _Blocus_,\r\npp. 110-142. Phillimore, III. § 293, takes up the same standpoint in so\r\nfar as a blockade _de facto_ is concerned:--\"A blockade _de facto_\r\nshould be effected by stationing a number of ships, and forming as it\r\nwere an arch of circumvallation round the mouth of the prohibited port,\r\nwhere, if the arch fails in any one part, the blockade itself fails\r\naltogether.\"]\r\n\r\nAccording to another opinion, a blockade is effective when the approach\r\nis watched--to use the words of Dr. Lushington[759]--\"by a force\r\nsufficient to render the egress and ingress dangerous, or, in other\r\nwords, save under peculiar circumstances, as fogs, violent winds, and\r\nsome necessary absences, sufficient to render the capture of vessels\r\nattempting to go in or come out most probable.\" According to this\r\nopinion there need be no chain of anchored men-of-war to expose any\r\nvessels attempting to break the blockade to a cross fire, but a real\r\ndanger of capture suffices, whether the danger is caused by cruising or\r\nanchored men-of-war. This is the standpoint of theory and practice of\r\nGreat Britain and the United States, and it seems likewise to be that of\r\nGermany and several German writers.[760] The blockade during the\r\nAmerican War of the whole coast of the Confederate States to the extent\r\nof 2500 nautical miles by four hundred Federal cruisers could, of\r\ncourse, only be maintained by cruising vessels; and the fact that all\r\nneutral maritime States recognised it as effective shows that the\r\nopinion of dissenting writers has more theoretical than practical\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 759: In his judgment in the case of the _Franciska_ (1855),\r\nSpinks, 287.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 760: See Perels, § 49; Bluntschli, § 829; Liszt, § 41, III.]\r\n\r\nThe Declaration of London has settled the controversy in so far as\r\narticle 3 enacts that \"the question whether a blockade is effective, is\r\na question of fact.\" Each case must, therefore, be judged according to\r\nits merits, and the before mentioned decision of Dr. Lushington would\r\nseem to have found implied recognition by article 3.\r\n\r\nThe question of effectiveness being one of fact, and the real danger to\r\npassing vessels being the characteristic of effectiveness of blockade,\r\nit must be recognised that in certain cases and in the absence of a\r\nsufficient number of men-of-war a blockade may be made effective through\r\nplanting land batteries within range of any vessel attempting to\r\npass,[761] provided there be at least one man-of-war on the spot. But a\r\nstone blockade,[762] so called because vessels laden with stones are\r\nsunk in the channel to block the approach, is not an effective blockade.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 761: The _Nancy_ (1809), 1 Acton, 63; the _Circassian_ (1864),\r\n2 Wallace, 135; the _Olinde Rodrigues_ (1898), 174, United States, 510.\r\nSee also Bluntschli, § 829; Perels, § 49; Geffcken in Holtzendorff, IV.\r\np. 750; Walker, _Manual_, § 78.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 762: See above, § 368, p. 450, note 1. It ought to be\r\nmentioned here also that according to article 2 of Convention VIII. \"it\r\nis forbidden to lay automatic contact mines off the ports and coasts of\r\nthe enemy, with the sole object of intercepting commercial navigation.\"]\r\n\r\nAnd it must, lastly, be mentioned that the distance of the blockading\r\nmen-of war from the blockaded port or coast is immaterial so long as the\r\ncircumstances and conditions of the special case justify such distance.\r\nThus during the Crimean War the port of Riga was blockaded by a\r\nman-of-war stationed at a distance of 120 miles from the town, in the\r\nLyser Ort, a channel three miles wide forming the only approach to the\r\ngulf.[763]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 763: The _Franciska_ (1855), Spinks, 287. See Hall, § 260, and\r\nHolland, _Studies_, pp. 166-167.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Amount of Danger which creates Effectiveness.]\r\n\r\n§ 381. It is impossible to state exactly what degree of danger to a\r\nvessel attempting to pass is necessary to prove an effective blockade.\r\nIt is recognised that a blockade does not cease to be effective in case\r\nnow and then a vessel succeeds in passing the line unhindered, provided\r\nthere was so much danger as to make her capture probable. Dr. Lushington\r\nstrikingly dealt with the matter in the following words:[764]--\"The\r\nmaintenance of a blockade must always be a question of degree--of the\r\ndegree of danger attending ships going into or leaving a port. Nothing\r\nis further from my intention, nor indeed more opposed to my notions,\r\nthan any relaxation of the rule that a blockade must be sufficiently\r\nmaintained; but it is perfectly obvious that no force could bar the\r\nentrance to absolute certainty; that vessels may get in and get out\r\nduring the night, or fogs, or violent winds, or occasional absence; that\r\nit is most difficult to judge from numbers alone. Hence, I believe that\r\nin every case the inquiry has been, whether the force was competent and\r\npresent, and, if so, the performance of the duty was presumed; and I\r\nthink I may safely assert that in no case was a blockade held to be void\r\nwhen the blockading force was on the spot or near thereto on the ground\r\nof vessels entering into or escaping from the port, where such ingress\r\nor egress did not take place with the consent of the blockading\r\nsquadron.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 764: In his judgment in the case of the _Franciska_ (1855),\r\nSpinks, 287.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cessation of Effectiveness.]\r\n\r\n§ 382. A blockade is effective so long as the danger lasts which makes\r\nprobable the capture of such vessels as attempt to pass the approach. A\r\nblockade, therefore, ceases _ipso facto_ by the absence of such danger,\r\nwhether the blockading men-of-war are driven away, or are sent away for\r\nthe fulfilment of some task which has nothing to do with the blockade,\r\nor voluntarily withdraw, or allow the passage of vessels in other cases\r\nthan those which are exceptionally admissible. Thus, when in 1861,\r\nduring the American Civil War, the Federal cruiser _Niagara_, which\r\nblockaded Charleston, was sent away and her place was taken after five\r\ndays by the _Minnesota_, the blockade ceased to be effective, although\r\nthe Federal Government refused to recognise this.[765] Thus, further,\r\nwhen during the Crimean War Great Britain allowed Russian vessels to\r\nexport goods from blockaded ports, and accordingly the egress of such\r\nvessels from the blockaded port of Riga was permitted, the blockade of\r\nRiga ceased to be effective, because it tried to interfere with neutral\r\ncommerce only; therefore, the capture of the Danish vessel\r\n_Franciska_[766] for attempting to break the blockade was not upheld.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 765: See Mountague Bernard, _Neutrality of Great Britain\r\nduring the American Civil War_ (1870), pp. 237-239.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 766: Spinks, 287. See above, § 370.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, practice[767] and the majority of writers have always\r\nrecognised the fact that a blockade does not cease to be effective in\r\ncase the blockading force is driven away for a short time through stress\r\nof weather, and article 4 of the Declaration of London precisely enacts\r\nthat \"a blockade is not regarded as raised if the blockading force is\r\ntemporarily withdrawn on account of stress of weather.\" English[768]\r\nwriters, further, have hitherto denied that a blockade loses\r\neffectiveness through a blockading man-of-war being absent for a short\r\ntime for the purpose of chasing a vessel which succeeded in passing the\r\napproach unhindered,[769] but the Declaration of London does not\r\nrecognise this.[770]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 767: The _Columbia_ (1799), 1 C. Rob. 154.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 768: See Twiss, II. § 103, p. 201, and Phillimore, III. §\r\n294.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 769: See article 37 of U.S. Naval War Code.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 770: See the Report of the Drafting Committee on article 4 of\r\nthe Declaration of London.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nBREACH OF BLOCKADE\r\n\r\n  See the literature quoted above at the commencement of § 368.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Definition of Breach of Blockade.]\r\n\r\n§ 383. Breach or violation of blockade is the unallowed ingress or\r\negress of a vessel in spite of the blockade. The attempted breach is, so\r\nfar as punishment is concerned, treated in the same way as the\r\nconsummated breach, but the practice of States has hitherto differed\r\nwith regard to the question at what time and by what act an attempt to\r\nbreak a blockade commences.\r\n\r\nIt must be specially observed that the blockade-runner violates\r\nInternational Law as little as the contraband carrier. Both (see below,\r\n§ 398) violate injunctions of the belligerent concerned.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: No Breach without Notice of Blockade.]\r\n\r\n§ 384. Since breach of blockade is, from the standpoint of the\r\nblockading belligerent, a criminal act, knowledge on the part of a\r\nvessel of the existence of a blockade is essential for making her egress\r\nor ingress a breach of blockade.\r\n\r\nIt is for this reason that Continental theory and practice have never\r\nconsidered a blockade established without local and diplomatic\r\nnotification, so that every vessel might have, or might be supposed to\r\nhave, notice of the existence of a blockade. And for the same reason\r\nsome States, as France and Italy, have never considered a vessel to have\r\ncommitted a breach of blockade unless a special warning was given her\r\nbefore her attempted ingress by one of the blockading cruisers stopping\r\nher and recording the warning upon her log-book.[771]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 771: See above, § 376.]\r\n\r\nBritish, American, and Japanese practice regarding the necessary\r\nknowledge of the existence of a blockade on the part of a vessel has\r\nalways made a distinction between actual and constructive notice, no\r\nbreach of blockade having been held to exist without either the one or\r\nthe other.[772] Actual notice has been considered knowledge acquired by\r\na direct warning from one of the blockading men-of-war or knowledge\r\nacquired from any other public or private source of information.\r\nConstructive knowledge has been presumed knowledge of the blockade on\r\nthe part of a vessel on the ground either of notoriety or of diplomatic\r\nnotification. The existence of a blockade has always been presumed to be\r\nnotorious to vessels within the blockaded ports, but it has been a\r\nquestion of fact whether it was notorious to other vessels. And\r\nknowledge of the existence of a blockade has always been presumed on the\r\npart of a vessel in case sufficient time had elapsed after the home\r\nState of the vessel had received diplomatic notification of the\r\nblockade, so that it could inform thereof all vessels sailing under its\r\nflag, whether or no they had actually received, or taken notice of, the\r\ninformation.[773]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 772: See Holland, _Prize Law_, §§ 107, 114-127; U.S. Naval War\r\nCode, article 39; Japanese Prize Law, article 30.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 773: The _Vrouw Judith_ (1799), 1 C. Rob. 150; the _Neptunus_\r\n(1799), 2 C. Rob. 110; the _Calypso_ (1799), 2 C. Rob. 298; the\r\n_Neptunus_ (1800), 3 C. Rob. 173; the _Hoffnung_ (1805), 6 C. Rob. 112.]\r\n\r\nThe Declaration of London follows, to a certain extent, British,\r\nAmerican, and Japanese practice, but differs chiefly in the presumption\r\nthat knowledge of a blockade is never absolute, but may in every case be\r\nrebutted. Article 14 enacts that \"the liability of a neutral vessel to\r\ncapture for breach of blockade is contingent on her knowledge, actual or\r\npresumptive, of the blockade.\" Knowledge of the blockade is presumed,\r\n_failing proof to the contrary_, in case the vessel has left a neutral\r\nport subsequent to the notification of the blockade to the Power to\r\nwhich such port belongs, and provided that the notification was made in\r\nsufficient time (article 15). But in case a neutral vessel _approaching_\r\na blockaded port has neither actual nor presumptive knowledge of the\r\nblockade, she is not considered _in delicto_, and notification must be\r\nmade to her by recording a warning on her log-book, stating the day and\r\nhour and the geographical position of the vessel at the time (article\r\n16, first paragraph). Further, if a neutral vessel is _coming out_ of a\r\nblockaded port, she must be allowed to pass free, in case, through the\r\nnegligence of the officer commanding the blockading fleet, no\r\ndeclaration of blockade was notified to the local authorities, or in\r\ncase, in the declaration as notified, no period was mentioned within\r\nwhich neutral vessels might come out (article 16, second paragraph).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The former practice as to what constitutes an Attempt to\r\nbreak Blockade.]\r\n\r\n§ 385. The practice of States as well as the opinions of writers have\r\nhitherto differed much regarding such acts of a vessel as constitute an\r\nattempt to break blockade.\r\n\r\n(1) The Second Armed Neutrality of 1800 intended to restrict an attempt\r\nto break blockade to the employment of force or ruse by a vessel on the\r\nline of blockade for the purpose of passing through. This was, on the\r\nwhole, the practice of France, which moreover, as stated before,\r\nrequired that the vessel should previous to the attempt have received\r\nspecial warning from one of the blockading men-of-war. Many writers[774]\r\ntook the same standpoint.\r\n\r\n(2) The practice of other States, as Japan, approved by many\r\nwriters,[775] went beyond this and considered it an attempt to break\r\nblockade when a vessel, with or without force or ruse, endeavoured to\r\npass the line of blockade. This practice frequently saw an attempt\r\ncomplete in the fact that a vessel destined for a blockaded place was\r\nfound anchoring or cruising near the line of blockade.\r\n\r\n(3) The practice of Great Britain and the United States of America went\r\nfurthest, since it considered it an attempted breach of blockade when a\r\nvessel, not destined according to her ship papers for a blockaded port,\r\nwas found near it and steering for it; and, further, when a vessel\r\ndestined for a port, the blockade of which was diplomatically notified,\r\nstarted on her journey knowing that the blockade had not been raised,\r\nexcept when the port from which the vessel sailed was so distant from\r\nthe scene of war as to justify her master in starting for a destination\r\nknown to be blockaded, on the chance of finding that the blockade had\r\nbeen removed, and with an intention of changing her destination should\r\nthat not prove to be the case.[776] This practice, further, applied the\r\ndoctrine of continuous voyages[777] to blockade, for it considered an\r\nattempt of breach of blockade to have been committed by such vessel as,\r\nalthough ostensibly destined for a neutral or an unblockaded port, is in\r\nreality intended, after touching there, to go on to a blockaded\r\nport.[778]\r\n\r\n(4) During the Civil War the American Prize Courts carried the practice\r\nfurther by condemning such vessels for breach of blockade as knowingly\r\ncarried to a neutral port cargo ultimately destined for a blockaded\r\nport, and by condemning for breach of blockade such cargo, but not the\r\nvessel, as was ultimately destined for a blockaded port, when the\r\ncarrying vessel was ignorant of this ulterior destination of the cargo.\r\nThus the _Bermuda_,[779] a British vessel with a cargo, part of which\r\nwas, in the opinion of the American Courts, ultimately destined for the\r\nblockaded ports of the Confederate States, was seized on her voyage to\r\nthe neutral British port of Nassau, in the Bahama Islands, and condemned\r\nfor breach of blockade by the American Courts. The same happened to the\r\nBritish vessel _Stephen Hart_,[780] which was seized on her voyage to\r\nthe neutral port of Cardenas, in Cuba. And in the famous case of the\r\n_Springbok_,[781] a British vessel also destined for Nassau, in the\r\nBahama Islands, which was seized on her voyage to this neutral British\r\nport, the cargo alone was finally condemned for breach of blockade,\r\nsince, in the opinion of the Court, the vessel was not cognisant that\r\nthe cargo was intended to reach a blockaded port. The same happened to\r\nthe cargo of the British vessel _Peterhoff_[782] destined for the\r\nneutral port of Matamaros, in Mexico. The British Government declined to\r\nintervene in favour of the British owners of the respective vessels and\r\ncargoes.[783]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 774: See Hautefeuille, II. p. 134; Kleen, I. § 137; Gessner,\r\np. 202; Dupuis, No. 185; Fauchille, _Blocus_, p. 322.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 775: See Bluntschli, § 835; Perels, § 51; Geffcken in\r\nHoltzendorff, IV. p. 763; Rivier, II. p. 431.

The Declaration of London proposes a settlement of this\r\ncontroversial matter by enacting in article 17 that \"neutral vessels may\r\nnot be captured for breach of blockade except within the area of\r\noperations of the men-of-war detailed to render the blockade\r\neffective,\" and in article 19 that \"whatever may be the ulterior\r\ndestination of a vessel or of her cargo, she may not be captured for\r\nbreach of blockade, if, at the moment, she is on the way to a\r\nnon-blockaded port.\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly, a neutral vessel, to be guilty of an attempt to break\r\nblockade, must actually have entered the _area of operations_ (_rayon\r\nd'action_) of the blockading fleet. This _area of operations_ is a\r\nquestion of fact in each case of a blockade. \"When a Government decides\r\nto undertake blockading operations against some part of the enemy coast\r\nit details a certain number of men-of-war to take part in the blockade,\r\nand entrusts the command to an officer whose duty it is to use them for\r\nthe purpose of making the blockade effective. The commander of the naval\r\nforce thus formed posts the vessels at his disposal according to the\r\nline of the coast and the geographical position of the blockaded places,\r\nand instructs each vessel as to the part which she has to play, and\r\nespecially as to the zone which she is to watch. All the zones watched\r\ntaken together and so organised as to make the blockade effective, form\r\nthe area of operations of the blockading force.\"[785]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 785: Report of the Drafting Committee on article 17.]\r\n\r\nBut the fact alone that a neutral vessel has entered the area of\r\noperations is not sufficient to justify her capture, she must also be\r\ndestined and be on her way to the blockaded port. If she passes through\r\nthe area of operations without being destined and on her way to the\r\nblockaded port, she is not attempting to break the blockade. Even should\r\nthe ulterior destination of a vessel or her cargo be the blockaded port,\r\nshe is not considered to attempt to break the blockade, if, at the\r\nmoment of the visitation, she is really on her way to a non-blockaded\r\nport (article 19). However, she must really, and not only apparently, be\r\non her way to a non-blockaded port; if it can be proved that in reality\r\nher immediate destination is the blockaded port and that she only feigns\r\nto be destined for a non-blockaded port, she may be captured, for she is\r\nactually attempting to break the blockade.[786]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 786: See the Report of the Drafting Committee on article 19.]\r\n\r\nFrom these stipulations of the Declaration of London it becomes quite\r\napparent that the application to blockade of the doctrine of continuous\r\nvoyage in any form is not admissible.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: When Ingress is not considered Breach of Blockade.]\r\n\r\n§ 386. Although blockade inwards interdicts ingress to all vessels, if\r\nnot especially licensed,[787] necessity makes exceptions to the rule.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 787: See above, § 370.]\r\n\r\nAccording to the practice which has hitherto been quite general,\r\nwhenever a vessel either by need of repairs,[788] stress of\r\nweather,[789] want of water[790] or provisions, or upon any other ground\r\nwas absolutely obliged to enter a blockaded port, such ingress did not\r\nconstitute a breach of blockade. On the other hand, according to the\r\nBritish practice at any rate, ingress did not cease to be breach of\r\nblockade if caused by intoxication of the master,[791] ignorance[792] of\r\nthe coast, loss of compass,[793] endeavour to get a pilot,[794] and the\r\nlike, or an attempt to ascertain[795] whether the blockade was\r\nraised.[796]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 788: The _Charlotta_ (1810), Edwards, 252.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 789: The _Fortuna_ (1803), 5 C. Rob. 27.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 790: The _Hurtige Hanne_ (1799), 2 C. Rob. 124.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 791: The _Shepherdess_ (1804), 5 C. Rob. 262.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 792: The _Adonis_ (1804), 5 C.

Rob. 76.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 796: See Holland, _Prize Law_, §§ 135-136.]\r\n\r\nThe Declaration of London recognises that necessity makes exceptions to\r\nthe rule that vessels may not enter a blockaded port. Article 7 enacts\r\nthat \"in circumstances of distress, acknowledged by an officer of the\r\nblockading force, a neutral vessel may enter a place under blockade, and\r\nsubsequently leave it, provided that she has neither discharged nor\r\nshipped any cargo there.\" It has, however, to be kept in view that\r\narticle 7, firstly, does not define the term _circumstances of\r\ndistress_, and, secondly, makes it a condition that the circumstances\r\nconcerned must be acknowledged by an officer of the blockading force.\r\nEverything is, therefore, _prima facie_ at any rate, left to the\r\nconsideration of the respective officer. A vessel in distress will have\r\nto signal to the man-of-war of the blockading force which she meets\r\nwithin the area of operations that she intends to enter the blockaded\r\nport, and the commander of the man-of-war will have to convince himself\r\nthat circumstances of distress really exist, and that no fraud is\r\nintended. The commander may deny the condition of distress, and then the\r\nvessel may not proceed, although the State whose flag she flies may ask\r\nfor indemnities in case there really was distress and the vessel was\r\nlost or damaged by not being allowed to enter the blockaded port. On the\r\nother hand, when once the commander of the man-of-war has acknowledged\r\nthat the respective vessel is in a condition of distress, it is not in\r\nhis discretion, but he is in duty bound,[797] to allow her to enter the\r\nblockaded port.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 797: See Report of the Drafting Committee on article 7.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: When Egress is not considered Breach of Blockade.]\r\n\r\n§ 387. There are a few cases of egress which, according to the hitherto\r\nprevailing practice of Great Britain and most other States, were not\r\nconsidered breaches of blockade outwards.[798] Thus, a vessel that was\r\nin a blockaded port before the commencement of the blockade[799] was\r\nallowed to sail from this port in ballast, as was also a vessel that had\r\nentered during a blockade either in ignorance of it or with the\r\npermission of the blockading squadron.[800] Thus, further, a vessel the\r\ncargo of which was put on board before the commencement of the blockade\r\nwas allowed to leave the port afterwards unhindered.[801] Thus, again, a\r\nvessel obliged by absolute necessity to enter a blockaded port was\r\nafterwards allowed to leave it unhindered. And a vessel employed by the\r\ndiplomatic envoy of a neutral State for the exclusive purpose of sending\r\nhome from a blockaded port distressed seamen of his nationality was also\r\nallowed to pass unhindered.[802]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 798: See Holland, _Prize Law_, § 130; Twiss, II. § 113;\r\nPhillimore, III. § 313.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 799: The _Frederick Moltke_ (1798), 1 C. Rob. 86.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 800: The _Juno_ (1799), 2 C. Rob. 116.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 801: The _Vrouw Judith_ (1799), 1 C. Rob. 150.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 802: The _Rose in Bloom_ (1811), 1 Dodson, 55.]\r\n\r\nThe Declaration of London recognises by article 7--see above, §\r\n386--that a vessel which, on account of distress, entered a blockaded\r\nport, must be allowed to leave it afterwards, provided she has neither\r\ndischarged nor shipped cargo there. And article 16, second\r\nparagraph--see above, § 384--enacts that a vessel coming out of a\r\nblockaded port must be allowed to pass free, if, through the negligence\r\nof the commander of the blockading fleet, no declaration of blockade has\r\nbeen notified to the local authorities, or if, in the declaration as\r\nnotified, no period has been mentioned within which neutral vessels\r\nmight come out. But beyond these the Declaration of London does not\r\nspecify any cases in which egress is not considered breach of blockade.\r\nThe International Prize Court will, if established, have to develop a\r\nmore detailed practice concerning the matter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Passage through Unblockaded Canal no Breach of Blockade.]\r\n\r\n§ 388. A breach of blockade can only be committed by passing through the\r\nblockaded approach. Therefore, if the maritime approach to a port is\r\nblockaded whilst an inland canal leads to another unblockaded port of\r\nthe enemy or to a neutral port, no breach of blockade is committed by\r\nthe egress or the ingress of a vessel passing such canal for the purpose\r\nof reaching the blockaded port.[803]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 803: The _Stert_ (1801), 4 C. Rob. 65. See Phillimore, III. §\r\n314.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the Declaration of London does not mention this point, the\r\nInternational Prize Court would surely decide it as stated, since this\r\ndecision is based on common sense.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nCONSEQUENCES OF BREACH OF BLOCKADE\r\n\r\n  See the literature quoted above at the commencement of § 368.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Capture of Blockade-running Vessels.]\r\n\r\n§ 389. It is universally recognised that a vessel may be captured for a\r\nbreach of blockade _in delicto_ only, that means, during the time of an\r\nattempt to break it, or of the breach itself. But here again practice as\r\nwell as theory hitherto have differed much, since there has been no\r\nunanimity with regard to the extent of time during which an attempt of\r\nbreach and the breach itself could be said to be actually continuing.\r\n\r\nIt has already been stated above in § 385 that it has been a moot point\r\nfrom what moment a breach of blockade could be said to have been\r\nattempted, and that according to the practice of Great Britain and the\r\nUnited States an attempt was to be found in the fact that a vessel\r\ndestined for a blockaded port was starting on her voyage. It is obvious\r\nthat the controversy bore upon the question from what point of time a\r\nblockade-running vessel must be considered _in delicto_.\r\n\r\nBut it has been likewise a moot point as to when the period of time\r\nduring which a blockade-running vessel might be said to be _in delicto_\r\ncame to an end. According to Continental theory and practice, such\r\nvessel was considered to be _in delicto_ only so long as she was\r\nactually on the line of blockade, or, having fled from there, so long as\r\nshe was pursued by one of the blockading cruisers. On the other hand,\r\naccording to the practice of Great Britain[804] and the United\r\nStates,[805] a blockade-running vessel was held to be _in delicto_ so\r\nlong as she _had not completed her voyage from the blockaded port to the\r\nport of her destination and back to the port from which she started\r\noriginally_, the voyage out and home being considered one voyage. But a\r\nvessel was held to be _in delicto_ so long only as the blockade\r\ncontinued, capture being no longer admissible in case the blockade had\r\nbeen raised or had otherwise come to an end.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 804: The _Welvaart van Pillaw_ (1799), 2 C. Rob. 128; _General\r\nHamilton_ (1805), 6 C. Rob. 61.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 805: See U.S. Naval War Code, article 44.]\r\n\r\nThe Declaration of London, when ratified, will settle the controversy,\r\nfor, according to article 20, a vessel is _in delicto_ so long only as\r\nshe is pursued by a man-of-war of the blockading force, and she may no\r\nlonger be captured if the pursuit is abandoned or if the blockade is\r\nraised. Stress must be laid on two points. Firstly, the pursuit must be\r\ncarried out by a man-of-war belonging to the blockading force, and not\r\nby any other cruiser. Secondly, a blockade-breaking vessel is liable to\r\ncapture so long as the pursuit lasts, whether or no she is still within\r\nthe area of operations; even if for a while she has taken refuge in a\r\nneutral port, she may, on coming out, be captured, provided the captor\r\nis one of the men-of-war of the blockading force which pursued her and\r\nwaited for her outside the port of refuge.[806]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 806: See the Report of the Drafting Committee on article 20.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Penalty for Breach of Blockade.]\r\n\r\n§ 390. Capture being effected, the blockade-runner must be sent to a\r\nport to be brought before a Prize Court. For this purpose the crew may\r\nbe temporarily detained, as they will have to serve as witnesses. In\r\nformer times the crew could be imprisoned, and it is said that even\r\ncapital[807] punishment could have been pronounced against them. But\r\nsince the eighteenth century this practice of imprisoning the crew has\r\nbeen abandoned, and nowadays the crew may not even be made prisoners of\r\nwar, but must be released as soon as the Prize Court has pronounced its\r\nverdict.[808] The only penalty which may be pronounced is confiscation\r\nof the vessel and the cargo. But the practice[809] of the several States\r\nhas hitherto differed much concerning the penalty for breach of\r\nblockade. According to British and American practice, confiscation of\r\nboth vessel and cargo used to take place in case the owners of the\r\nvessel were identical with those of the cargo. In case vessel and cargo\r\nhad not the same owners, confiscation of both took place only when the\r\ncargo consisted of contraband of war or the owners knew of the blockade\r\nat the time the cargo was shipped for the blockaded port.[810] And it\r\nmattered not whether the captured vessel which carried the cargo had\r\nherself actually passed through the blockaded line, or the breach of\r\nblockade was effected through a combined action of lighters and the\r\nvessel, the lighters passing the line and discharging the cargo into the\r\nvessel near the line, or _vice versa_.[811] The cargo alone was\r\nconfiscated according to the judgments of the American Prize Courts\r\nduring the Civil War in the case of the _Springbok_ and in similar\r\ncases[812] when goods ultimately destined for a blockaded port were sent\r\nto a neutral port on a vessel whose owners were ignorant of this\r\nulterior destination of the goods.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 807: See Bynkershoek, _Quaest. jur. publ._ I. c. 11.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 808: See Calvo, V. §§ 2897-2898.

The case in which the whole or part\r\nof the cargo consists of contraband, is not mentioned by article 21, but\r\nits condemnation is a matter of course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nCONTRABAND\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nCONCEPTION OF CONTRABAND\r\n\r\n  Grotius, III. c. 1, § 5--Bynkershoek, _Quaest. jur. publ._\r\n  I. cc, IX-XII--Vattel, III. §§ 111-113--Hall, §§ 236-247--Lawrence, §§\r\n  253-259--Westlake, II. pp. 240-265--Maine, pp. 96-122--Manning, pp.\r\n  352-399--Phillimore, III. §§ 226-284--Twiss, II. §§ 121-151--Halleck,\r\n  II. pp. 214-238--Taylor, §§ 653-666--Walker, §§ 73-75--Wharton, III.\r\n  §§ 368-375--Moore, VII. §§ 1249--1263--Wheaton, §§ 476-508\r\n  --Bluntschli, §§ 801-814--Heffter, §§ 158-161--Geffcken in\r\n  Holtzendorff, IV. pp. 713-731--Gareis, § 89--Liszt, § 42--Ullmann, §§\r\n  193-194--Bonfils, No. 1537-1588'15--Despagnet, Nos. 705-715 _ter_\r\n  --Rivier, II pp. 416-423--Calvo, V. §§ 2708-2795--Fiore, III.

The term contraband is derived from the Italian \"contrabbando,\"\r\nwhich, itself deriving from the Latin \"contra\" and \"bannum\" or \"bandum,\"\r\nmeans \"in defiance of an injunction.\" Contraband of war[813] is the\r\ndesignation of such goods as by either belligerent are forbidden to be\r\ncarried to the enemy on the ground that they enable the latter to carry\r\non the war with greater vigour. But this definition is only a formal\r\none, as it does not state what kinds of goods belong to the class of\r\ncontraband. This point was much controverted before the Declaration of\r\nLondon. Throughout the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries\r\nthe matter stood as Grotius had explained it. Although he does not\r\nemploy the term contraband, he treats of the matter. He[814]\r\ndistinguishes three different kinds of articles. Firstly, those which,\r\nas arms for instance, can only be made use of in war, and which are,\r\ntherefore, always contraband. Secondly, those, as for example articles\r\nof luxury, which can never be made use of in war and which, therefore,\r\nare never contraband. Thirdly, those which, as money, provisions, ships,\r\nand articles of naval equipment, can be made use of in war as well as in\r\npeace, and which are on account of their ancipitous use contraband or\r\nnot according to the circumstances of the case. In spite of\r\nBynkershoek's decided opposition[815] to this distinction by Grotius,\r\nthe practice of most belligerents until the beginning of the twentieth\r\ncentury has been in conformity with it. A great many treaties have from\r\nthe beginning of the sixteenth century been concluded between many\r\nStates for the purpose of fixing what articles belonging to the class of\r\nancipitous use should, and what should not, be regarded between the\r\nparties as contraband, but these treaties disagree with one another.\r\nAnd, so far as they were not bound by a treaty, belligerents formerly\r\nexercised their discretion in every war according to the special\r\ncircumstances and conditions in regarding or not regarding certain\r\narticles of ancipitous use as contraband. The endeavour of the First and\r\nthe Second Armed Neutrality of 1780 and 1800 to restrict the number and\r\nkinds of articles that could be regarded as contraband failed, and the\r\nDeclaration of Paris of 1856 uses the term contraband without any\r\nattempt to define it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 813: Although--see above, §§ 173-174--prevention of carriage\r\nof contraband is a means of sea warfare against the enemy, it chiefly\r\nconcerns neutral commerce and is, therefore, more conveniently treated\r\nwith neutrality.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 814: See Grotius, III. c. I, § 5:--\"Sunt res quae in bello\r\ntantum usum habent, ut arma: sunt quae in bello nullum habent usum, ut\r\nquae voluptati inserviunt: sunt quae et in bello et extra bellum usum\r\nhabent, ut pecuniae, commeatus, naves, et quae navibus adsunt.... In\r\ntertio illo genere usus ancipitis, distinguendus erit belli status....\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 815: See Bynkershoek, _Quaest. jur. publici._ I. c. X.]\r\n\r\nIt is by the Declaration of London that the Powers have, for the first\r\ntime in history, come to an agreement concerning what articles are\r\ncontraband. The distinction which Grotius made between three classes of\r\ngoods, while still recognised, has been merged by the Declaration of\r\nLondon into the distinction between articles of absolute contraband,\r\narticles of conditional contraband, and such articles as may under no\r\ncircumstances or conditions be considered contraband. This Declaration,\r\nmoreover, has put the whole matter of contraband upon a new basis, since\r\nthe Powers have by articles 22 to 44 agreed upon a common code of rules\r\nconcerning contraband.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Absolute and conditional Contraband, and free Articles.]\r\n\r\n§ 392. Apart from the distinction between articles which can be made use\r\nof only in war and those of ancipitous use, two different classes of\r\ncontraband must be distinguished.\r\n\r\nThere are, firstly, articles which by their very character are destined\r\nto be made use of in war. In this class are to be reckoned not only arms\r\nand ammunition, but also such articles of ancipitous use as military\r\nstores, naval stores, and the like. They are termed absolute contraband.\r\n\r\nThere are, secondly, articles which by their very character are not\r\ndestined to be made use of in war, but which under certain circumstances\r\nand conditions can be of the greatest use to a belligerent for the\r\ncontinuation of the war. To this class belong, for instance, provisions,\r\ncoal, gold, and silver. These articles are termed conditional or\r\nrelative contraband.\r\n\r\nAlthough hitherto not all the States have made this distinction,\r\nnevertheless they did make a distinction in so far as they varied the\r\nlist of articles which they declared contraband in their different wars;\r\ncertain articles, as arms and ammunition, have always been on the list,\r\nwhilst other articles were only considered contraband when the\r\ncircumstances of a particular war made it necessary. The majority of\r\nwriters have always approved of the distinction between absolute and\r\nconditional contraband, although several insisted that arms and\r\nammunition only and exclusively could be recognised as contraband, and\r\nthat conditional contraband did not exist.[816] The distinction would\r\nseem to have been important not only regarding the question whether or\r\nno an article was contraband, but also regarding the consequences of\r\ncarrying contraband.[817]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 816: See, for instance, Hautefeuille, II. p. 157, and Kleen,\r\nI. § 90.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 817: See below, § 405, p. 510.]\r\n\r\nThe Declaration of London has adopted (articles 22 and 24) the\r\ndistinction between absolute and conditional contraband, but it\r\ndistinguishes, besides these two classes of articles, a third class\r\n(article 27). To this class belong all articles which are either not\r\nsusceptible of use in war, or the possibility of the use of which in war\r\nis so remote as practically to make them not susceptible of use in war.\r\nThese articles are termed _free articles_.[818]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 818: But there are a number of other free articles, although\r\nthey do not belong to the articles characterised above; see below, §\r\n396_a_.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Articles absolutely Contraband.]\r\n\r\n§ 393. That absolute contraband cannot and need not be restricted to\r\narms and ammunition only and exclusively becomes obvious, if the fact is\r\ntaken into consideration that other articles, although of ancipitous\r\nuse, can be as valuable and essential to a belligerent for the\r\ncontinuance of the war as arms and ammunition. The necessary machinery\r\nand material for the manufacture of arms and ammunition are almost as\r\nvaluable as the latter themselves, and warfare on sea can as little be\r\nwaged without vessels and articles of naval equipment as without arms\r\nand ammunition. But formerly no unanimity existed with regard to such\r\narticles of ancipitous use as had to be considered as absolute\r\ncontraband, and States, when they went to war, increased or restricted,\r\naccording to the circumstances of the particular war, the list of\r\narticles they considered absolute contraband.\r\n\r\nAccording to the British practice[819] which has hitherto\r\nprevailed--subject, however, to the prerogative of the Crown to order\r\nalterations of the list during a war--the following articles were\r\nconsidered absolute contraband:--\r\n\r\n  Arms of all kinds, and machinery for manufacturing arms;\r\n  ammunition, and materials for ammunition, including lead, sulphate\r\n  of potash, muriate of potash (chloride of potassium), chlorate of\r\n  potash, and nitrate of soda; gunpowder and its materials,\r\n  saltpetre and brimstone, also guncotton; military equipments and\r\n  clothing; military stores; naval stores, such as masts, spars,\r\n  rudders, ship timbers, hemp and cordage, sail-cloth, pitch and\r\n  tar, copper for sheathing vessels, marine engines and the\r\n  component parts thereof (including screw propellers,\r\n  paddle-wheels, cylinders, cranks, shafts, boilers, tubes for\r\n  boilers, boiler-plates and fire bars), maritime cement and the\r\n  materials used for its manufacture (as blue lias and Portland\r\n  cement), iron in any of the following forms: anchors, rivet-iron,\r\n  angle-iron, round bars of from 3/4 to 5/8 of an inch diameter,\r\n  rivets, strips of iron, sheet plate-iron exceeding 1/4 of an inch,\r\n  and Low Moor and Bowling plates.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 819: See Holland, _Prize Law_, § 62.]\r\n\r\nBy articles 22 and 23 of the Declaration of London an agreement has been\r\nreached according to which two classes of absolute contraband must be\r\ndistinguished. Article 22 enumerates eleven groups of articles which may\r\n_always_, without special declaration and notice, be treated as absolute\r\ncontraband. These constitute the first class. The second--see article\r\n23--consists of such articles exclusively used for war as are not\r\nenumerated[820] amongst the eleven groups of the first class; these may\r\nbe treated as absolute contraband also, but only _after special\r\ndeclaration and notification_. Such declaration may be published during\r\ntime of peace, and notification thereof must then be addressed to all\r\nother Powers; but if the declaration is published after the outbreak of\r\nhostilities, a notification need only be addressed to the neutral\r\nPowers. Should a Power--see article 26--waive, so far as itself is\r\nconcerned, the right to treat as absolute contraband an article\r\ncomprised in the first class, notification thereof must be made to the\r\nother Powers. The following are the groups of articles comprised in the\r\nfirst class:--\r\n\r\n  (1) Arms of all kinds, including arms for sporting purposes, and\r\n  their distinctive component parts.\r\n\r\n  (2) Projectiles, charges, and cartridges of all kinds, and their\r\n  distinctive component parts.\r\n\r\n  (3) Powder and explosives specially prepared for use in war.\r\n\r\n  (4) Gun-mountings, limber boxes, limbers, military waggons, field\r\n  forges, and their distinctive component parts.\r\n\r\n  (5) Clothing and equipment of a distinctively military character.\r\n\r\n  (6) All kinds of harness of a distinctively military character.\r\n\r\n  (7) Saddle, draught, and pack animals suitable for use in war.\r\n\r\n  (8) Articles of camp equipment, and their distinctive component\r\n  parts.\r\n\r\n  (9) Armour plates.\r\n\r\n  (10) Warships, including boats, and their distinctive component\r\n  parts of such a nature that they can only be used on a vessel of\r\n  war.\r\n\r\n  (11) Implements and apparatus designed exclusively for the\r\n  manufacture of munitions of war, for the manufacture or repair of\r\n  arms, or war material for use on land or sea.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 820: The Report of the Drafting Committee on article 23\r\nrecognises that at present it would be difficult to mention any articles\r\nwhich could under article 23 be declared absolute contraband, but since\r\nfuture contingencies cannot be foreseen, it was considered necessary to\r\nstipulate the possibility of increasing the list of absolute contraband.\r\nThat only such additional articles could be declared absolute contraband\r\nas by their very character are destined to be made use of in war, is a\r\nmatter of course.]\r\n\r\nIt is apparent that this list embodies a compromise, for it includes\r\nseveral articles--such as saddle, draught, and pack animals suitable for\r\nuse in war--which Great Britain and other Powers formerly only\r\nconsidered as conditional contraband.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Articles conditionally Contraband.]\r\n\r\n§ 394. There are many articles which are not by their character destined\r\nto be made use of in war, but which are nevertheless of great value to\r\nbelligerents for the continuance of war. Such articles are conditionally\r\ncontraband, which means that they are contraband when it is clearly\r\napparent--see below, § 395--that they are intended to be made use of for\r\nmilitary or naval purposes. This intention becomes apparent on\r\nconsidering either the destination of the vessel carrying the articles\r\nconcerned, or the consignee of the articles.\r\n\r\nBefore the Declaration of London neither the practice of States nor the\r\nopinion of writers agreed upon the matter, and it was in especial\r\ncontroversial[821] whether or no foodstuffs, horses and other beasts of\r\nburden, coal and other fuel, money and the like, and cotton could\r\nconditionally be declared contraband.\r\n\r\n(1) That _foodstuffs_ should not under ordinary circumstances be\r\ndeclared contraband there ought to be no doubt. There are even\r\nseveral[822] writers who emphatically deny that foodstuffs could ever be\r\nconditional contraband. But the majority of writers has always admitted\r\nthat foodstuffs destined for the use of the enemy army or navy might be\r\ndeclared contraband. This has been the practice of Great Britain,[823]\r\nthe United States of America, and Japan. But in 1885, during her\r\nhostilities against China, France declared rice in general as\r\ncontraband, on the ground of the importance of this article to the\r\nChinese population. And Russia in 1904, during the Russo-Japanese war,\r\ndeclared rice and provisions in general as contraband; on the protest of\r\nGreat Britain and the United States of America, however, she altered her\r\ndecision and declared these articles conditional contraband only.\r\n\r\n(2) The importance of _horses and other beasts of burden_ for cavalry,\r\nartillery, and military transport explains their frequently being\r\ndeclared as contraband by belligerents. No argument against their\r\ncharacter as conditional contraband can have any basis. But they were\r\nfrequently declared absolute contraband, as, for instance, by article 36\r\nof the United States Naval War Code of 1900. Russia, which during the\r\nRusso-Japanese War altered the standpoint taken up at first by her, and\r\nrecognised the distinction between absolute and conditional contraband,\r\nnevertheless maintained her declaration of horses and beasts of burden\r\nas absolute contraband. The Declaration of London, by article 22, No. 7,\r\ndeclares them as absolute contraband.\r\n\r\n(3) Since men-of-war are nowadays propelled by steam power, the\r\nimportance of _coal_, and eventually other fuel for waging war at sea is\r\nobvious. For this reason, Great Britain has ever since 1854 maintained\r\nthat coal, if destined for belligerent men-of-war or belligerent naval\r\nports, is contraband. But in 1859 France and Italy did not take up the\r\nsame standpoint. Russia, although in 1885 she declared that she would\r\nnever consent to coal being regarded as contraband, in 1904 declared\r\ncoal, naphtha, alcohol, and every other kind of fuel, absolute\r\ncontraband. And she adhered to this standpoint, although she was made to\r\nrecognise the distinction between absolute and conditional contraband.\r\n\r\n(4) As regards _money_, unwrought precious metals which may be coined\r\ninto money, bonds and the like, the mere fact that a neutral is\r\nprohibited by his duty of impartiality from granting a loan to a\r\nbelligerent ought to bring conviction that these articles are contraband\r\nif destined for the enemy State or its forces. However, the case seldom\r\nhappens that these articles are brought by neutral vessels to\r\nbelligerent ports, since under the modern conditions of trade\r\nbelligerents can be supplied in other ways with the necessary funds.\r\n\r\n(5) As regards _raw cotton_, it is asserted[824] that in 1861, during\r\nthe Civil War, the United States declared it absolute contraband under\r\nquite peculiar circumstances, since it took the place of money sent\r\nabroad for the purpose of paying for vessels, arms, and ammunition. But\r\nthis assertion is erroneous.[825] Be that as it may, raw cotton should\r\nnot, under ordinary circumstances, be able to be considered absolute\r\ncontraband. For this reason Great Britain protested when Russia, in 1904\r\nduring the Russo-Japanese War, declared cotton in general as contraband;\r\nRussia altered her standpoint and declared cotton conditional contraband\r\nonly.[826]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 821: See Perels, § 45, and Hall, §§ 242-246, who give\r\nbird's-eye views of the controversy.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 822: See, for instance, Bluntschli, § 807.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 823: The _Jonge Margaretha_ (1799), 1 C. Rob. 189.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 824: See Hall, § 246, p. 690, note 2; Taylor, § 662; Wharton,\r\nIII. § 373.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 825: See Moore, VII. § 1254, and Holland, _Letters to the\r\n\"Times\" upon War and Neutrality_ (1909) pp. 108-112.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 826: According to the British practice which has hitherto\r\nprevailed--see Holland, _Prize Law_, § 64--the list of conditional\r\ncontraband comprises:--Provisions and liquors for the consumption of\r\narmy and navy; money, telegraphic materials, such as wire, porous cups,\r\nplatina, sulphuric acid, and zinc; materials for the construction of a\r\nrailway, as iron bars, sleepers, and the like; coal, hay, horses, rosin,\r\ntallow, timber. But it always was in the prerogative of the Crown to\r\nextend or reduce this list during a war according to the requirements of\r\nthe circumstances.]\r\n\r\nBy articles 24 to 28 of the Declaration of London an agreement has been\r\nreached by the Powers according to which two classes of conditional\r\ncontraband must be distinguished. Article 24 enumerates fourteen groups\r\nof articles which may _always_, without special declaration and notice,\r\nbe treated as conditional contraband; these constitute the first class.\r\nThe second--see article 25--consists of articles which are not\r\nenumerated either amongst the eleven groups of absolute contraband\r\ncontained in article 22 or amongst the fourteen groups of conditional\r\ncontraband contained in article 24, but which are nevertheless\r\nsusceptible of use in war as well as for purposes of peace; these may be\r\ntreated as conditional contraband also, but _only after special\r\ndeclaration and notification_. Such declaration may be published during\r\ntime of peace, and notification thereof must then be addressed to all\r\nother Powers; but if the declaration is published after the outbreak of\r\nhostilities a notification need be addressed to the neutral Powers only.\r\nShould a Power--see article 26--waive, so far as itself is concerned,\r\nthe right to treat as conditional contraband an article comprised in the\r\nfirst class, notification thereof must be made to the other Powers. But\r\nit is of course obvious, although not specially stated in article 26,\r\nthat a Power may treat as conditional contraband any article belonging\r\neither to the first or second class of absolute contraband; in such a\r\ncase, however, special declaration and notification would seem to be\r\nnecessary. The following are the groups of articles comprised in the\r\nfirst class of conditional contraband:--\r\n\r\n  (1) Foodstuffs.\r\n\r\n  (2) Forage and grain, suitable for feeding animals.\r\n\r\n  (3) Clothing, fabrics for clothing, and boots and shoes, suitable\r\n  for use in war.\r\n\r\n  (4) Gold and silver in coin or bullion; paper money.\r\n\r\n  (5) Vehicles of all kinds available for use in war, and their\r\n  component parts.\r\n\r\n  (6) Vessels, craft, and boats of all kinds; floating docks, parts\r\n  of docks and their component parts.\r\n\r\n  (7) Railway material, both fixed and rolling-stock, and material\r\n  for telegraphs, wireless telegraphs, and telephones.\r\n\r\n  (8) Balloons and flying machines and their distinctive component\r\n  parts, together with accessories and articles recognisable as\r\n  intended for use in connection with balloons and flying machines.\r\n\r\n  (9) Fuel; lubricants.\r\n\r\n  (10) Powder and explosives not specially prepared for use in war.\r\n\r\n  (11) Barbed wire and implements for fixing and cutting the same.\r\n\r\n  (12) Horseshoes and shoeing materials.\r\n\r\n  (13) Harness and saddlery.\r\n\r\n  (14) Field glasses, telescopes, chronometers, and all kinds of\r\n  nautical instruments.\r\n\r\nThis list represents a compromise, just as does the list of absolute\r\ncontraband of article 22. Those opponents of the Declaration of London\r\nwho object to foodstuffs being on the list of conditional contraband\r\nforget that several times in the past--see above, p. 486\r\n(1)--belligerents have declared foodstuffs absolute contraband.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hostile Destination essential to Contraband.]\r\n\r\n§ 395. Whatever may be the nature of articles, they are never contraband\r\nunless they are destined for the use of a belligerent in war. Arms and\r\nammunition destined for a neutral are as little contraband as other\r\ngoods with the same destination. As this hostile destination is\r\nessential even for articles which are obviously used in war, such\r\nhostile destination is all the more important for such articles of\r\nancipitous use as are only conditionally contraband. Thus, for instance,\r\nprovisions and coal are perfectly innocent and not at all contraband if\r\nthey are not purposely destined for enemy troops and naval forces, but\r\nare destined for use by a neutral. However, the destination of the\r\narticles must not be confounded with the destination of the vessel which\r\ncarries them. For, on the one hand, certain articles with a hostile\r\ndestination are considered contraband although the carrying vessel is\r\ndestined for a neutral port, and, on the other hand, certain articles,\r\nalthough they are without a hostile destination, are considered\r\ncontraband because the carrying vessel is to touch at an intermediate\r\nenemy port and is, therefore, destined for such port, although her\r\nultimate destination is a neutral port.\r\n\r\nThe Declaration of London, by articles 30 to 36, enacts very detailed\r\nrules with regard to hostile destination, distinguishing clearly between\r\nthe characteristics of hostile destination of absolute contraband and\r\nthose of hostile destination of conditional contraband.\r\n\r\n(1) The destination of articles of _absolute_ contraband is, according\r\nto article 30, to be considered hostile if it be shown that they are\r\nbeing sent either to enemy territory, or to territory occupied by the\r\nenemy, or, further, to the armed forces of the enemy. And, according to\r\narticle 31, hostile destination of absolute contraband is considered to\r\nbe completely proved, firstly, when the goods are consigned to an enemy\r\nport or to the armed forces of the enemy, and, secondly, when the\r\nvessel is to call either at enemy ports only, or when she is to touch at\r\nan enemy port or meet the armed forces of the enemy before reaching the\r\nneutral port to which the cargo concerned is consigned.\r\n\r\n(2) The destination of articles of _conditional_ contraband, on the\r\nother hand, is, according to article 33, considered to be hostile if\r\nthey are intended for the use of the armed forces or of a government\r\ndepartment of the enemy State, unless in this latter case the\r\ncircumstances show that the articles concerned cannot in fact be used\r\nfor warlike purposes. Gold and silver in coin or bullion and paper\r\nmoney, however, are in every case considered to have a hostile\r\ndestination if intended for a government department of the enemy State.\r\nAnd, according to article 34, hostile destination of articles of\r\nconditional contraband is, if the contrary be not proved, presumed when\r\nthe articles are consigned, firstly, to enemy authorities or to an enemy\r\ncontractor[827] established in the enemy country, who as a matter of\r\ncommon knowledge supplies articles of this kind to the enemy, or,\r\nsecondly, to a fortified place of the enemy or to another place serving\r\nas a base[828]--whether of operations or supply--for the armed forces of\r\nthe enemy. On the other hand, if the articles are not so consigned and\r\nif the contrary be not proved, their destination is presumed to be\r\nnon-hostile. And in the case of a merchantman which can herself be\r\nconditional contraband if bound to a fortified place of the enemy or to\r\nanother place serving as a base for the armed forces of the enemy, there\r\nis no presumption of a hostile destination, but a direct proof is\r\nnecessary that she is destined for the use of the armed forces or of a\r\ngovernment department of the enemy State.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 827: The French text of article 34 contains the words _à un\r\ncommerçant établi en pays ennemi et lorsqu'il est notoire que ce\r\ncommerçant fournit à l'ennemi des objets et materiaux de cette nature_.\r\nThe translation _to an enemy contractor_ has been objected to by\r\nopponents of the Declaration of London, but it is absolutely correct\r\nbecause it meets the meaning of the French text.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 828: The Report of the Drafting Committee on article 34 states\r\nthat the base concerned may be one of operations or supply. Opponents of\r\nthe Declaration of London object to article 34 on account of the alleged\r\nambiguity of the words _place serving as a base for the armed forces of\r\nthe enemy_, and assert that all seaports of Great Britain might be\r\ntreated as bases of supply for the armed forces because railways connect\r\nthem with other places which actually serve as bases of supply or\r\noperations. This is surely erroneous, because the doctrine of continuous\r\nvoyages is not--see article 35 in contradistinction to article 30, and\r\nbelow, § 403_a_--to be applied to conditional contraband.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Free Articles.]\r\n\r\n§ 396. It is obvious that such articles as are not susceptible of use in\r\nwar may never be declared contraband, whether their destination be\r\nhostile or not.\r\n\r\nThe Declaration of London, by article 27, expressly recognises this and,\r\nin article 28--the so-called _free list_--enumerates seventeen groups of\r\narticles which may never be declared contraband in spite of their\r\nhostile destination, namely:--\r\n\r\n  (1) Raw cotton, wool, silk, jute, flax, hemp, and other raw\r\n  materials of the textile industries, and yarns of the same.\r\n\r\n  (2) Oil seeds and nuts; copra.\r\n\r\n  (3) Rubber, resins, gums, and lacs; hops.\r\n\r\n  (4) Raw hides and horns, bones, and ivory.\r\n\r\n  (5) Natural and artificial manures, including nitrates and\r\n  phosphates for agricultural purposes.\r\n\r\n  (6) Metallic ores.\r\n\r\n  (7) Earths, clays, lime, chalk, stone, including marble, bricks,\r\n  slates, and tiles.\r\n\r\n  (8) Chinaware and glass.\r\n\r\n  (9) Paper and paper-making materials.\r\n\r\n  (10) Soap, paint and colours, including articles exclusively used\r\n  in their manufacture, and varnish.\r\n\r\n  (11) Bleaching powder, soda, ash, caustic soda, salt cake,\r\n  ammonia, sulphate of ammonia, and sulphate of copper.\r\n\r\n  (12) Agricultural, mining, textile, and printing machinery.\r\n\r\n  (13) Precious and semi-precious stones, pearls, mother-of-pearl,\r\n  and coral.\r\n\r\n  (14) Clocks and watches, other than chronometers.\r\n\r\n  (15) Fashion and fancy goods.\r\n\r\n  (16) Feathers of all kinds, hairs, and bristles.\r\n\r\n  (17) Articles of household furniture and decoration, office\r\n  furniture and requisites.\r\n\r\nThis free list is of great importance to neutral trade, more\r\nparticularly as it not only comprises such articles as are not\r\nsusceptible of use in war, but likewise a number of articles, the\r\npossibility of the use of which in war is so remote as practically to\r\nmake them not susceptible of use in war. The list guarantees to a number\r\nof industries and trades of neutral States freedom from interference on\r\nthe part of belligerents, and it is to be expected that in time the list\r\nwill be increased.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Articles destined for the use of the carrying Vessel, or to\r\naid the Wounded.]\r\n\r\n§ 396_a_. Besides the seventeen groups of articles contained in the free\r\nlist, there are two other groups of free articles.\r\n\r\nFirstly, those articles which serve exclusively to aid the sick and\r\nwounded. They, according to article 29, No. 1, of the Declaration of\r\nLondon, may never be treated as contraband even if their destination is\r\nhostile. They may, however, in case of urgent military necessity and,\r\nsubject to the payment of compensation, be requisitioned if they are\r\ndestined to territory belonging to or occupied by the enemy or to the\r\narmed forces of the enemy.\r\n\r\nSecondly, articles intended for the use of the vessel in which they are\r\nfound or for the use of her crew and passengers during the voyage.\r\nHostile destination being essential before any kinds of articles may be\r\nconsidered contraband, those articles which are carried by a vessel\r\nevidently for her own use or for the use of her crew and passengers can\r\nnever be contraband, as is now specially stipulated by article 29, No.\r\n2, of the Declaration of London. Merchantmen frequently carry a gun and\r\na certain amount of ammunition for the purpose of signalling, and, if\r\nthey navigate in parts of the sea where there is danger of piracy, they\r\nfrequently carry a certain amount of arms and ammunition for defence\r\nagainst an attack by pirates. It will not be difficult either for the\r\nsearching belligerent man-of-war or for the Prize Court to ascertain\r\nwhether or no such arms and ammunition are carried _bona fide_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Contraband Vessels.]\r\n\r\n§ 397. A neutral vessel, whether carrying contraband or not, can herself\r\nbe contraband. Such is the case when she has been built or fitted out\r\nfor use in war and is on her way to the enemy. Although it is the duty\r\nof neutrals--see article 8 of Convention XIII., and above §§ 334 and\r\n350--to employ the means at their disposal to prevent the fitting out,\r\narming, or the departure of any vessel within their jurisdiction, which\r\nthey have reason to believe is intended to cruise or to engage in\r\nhostile operations against a belligerent, their duty of impartiality\r\ndoes not compel them to prevent their subjects from supplying a\r\nbelligerent with vessels fit for use in war except where the vessel\r\nconcerned has been built or fitted out by order of a belligerent.\r\nSubjects of neutrals may therefore--unless prevented from so doing by\r\nMunicipal Law, as, for instance, subjects of the British Crown by §§ 8\r\nand 9 of the Foreign Enlistment Act, 1870--by way of trade supply\r\nbelligerents with vessels of any kind, provided these vessels have not\r\nbeen built or fitted out by order of the belligerent concerned.\r\nAccording to the practice which has hitherto prevailed, such vessels,\r\nbeing equivalent to arms, used to be considered as absolute\r\ncontraband.[829] And it made no difference whether or no they were fit\r\nfor use as men-of-war, it sufficed that they were fit to be used for the\r\ntransport of troops and the like.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 829: The _Richmond_ (1804), 5 C. Rob. 325. See also Twiss, II.\r\n§ 148, and Holland, _Prize Law_, § 86.]\r\n\r\nAccording to article 22, No. 10, article 24, No. 6, and article 34 of\r\nthe Declaration of London the law concerning contraband vessels will be\r\nthe following:--A distinction is made between warships on the one hand,\r\nand, on the other, vessels and the like generally. According to article\r\n22, No. 10, warships, including their boats and their distinctive\r\ncomponent parts of such a nature that they can only be used on a vessel\r\nof war, may be treated as absolute contraband without notice. On the\r\nother hand, according to article 24, No. 6, vessels, craft, and boats of\r\nall kinds, and, further, floating docks, parts of docks and their\r\ncomponent parts may only be treated as conditional contraband, but may\r\nbe so treated without notice. And it must be specially observed that\r\nwhereas with regard to articles of conditional contraband generally,\r\nthere is a legal presumption established as to their hostile destination\r\nin case they are consigned to enemy authorities or to a contractor\r\nestablished in the enemy country, who, as a matter of common knowledge,\r\nsupplies articles of this kind to the enemy, article 34 expressly\r\nexempts merchant vessels from this presumption in case it is sought to\r\nprove that they themselves are contraband.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nCARRIAGE OF CONTRABAND\r\n\r\n  See the literature quoted above at the commencement of § 391.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Carriage of Contraband Penal by the Municipal Law of\r\nBelligerents.]\r\n\r\n§ 398. The guaranteed freedom of commerce making the sale of articles of\r\nall kinds to belligerents by subjects of neutrals legitimate, articles\r\nof conditional as well as absolute contraband may be supplied by sale to\r\neither belligerent by these individuals. And the carriage of such\r\narticles by neutral merchantmen on the Open Sea is, as far as\r\nInternational Law is concerned, quite as legitimate as their sale. The\r\ncarrier of contraband by no means violates an injunction of the Law of\r\nNations. But belligerents have by the Law of Nations the right to\r\nprohibit and punish the carriage of contraband by neutral merchantmen,\r\nand the carrier of contraband violates, for this reason, an injunction\r\nof the belligerent concerned. It is not International Law, but the\r\nMunicipal Law of the belligerents, which makes carriage of contraband\r\nillegitimate and penal.[830] The question why the carriage of contraband\r\narticles may nevertheless be prohibited and punished by the\r\nbelligerents, although it is quite legitimate so far as International\r\nLaw is concerned, can only be answered by a reference to the historical\r\ndevelopment of the Law of Nations. In contradistinction to former\r\npractice, which interdicted all trade between neutrals and the enemy,\r\nthe principle of freedom of commerce between subjects of neutrals and\r\neither belligerent has gradually become universally recognised; but this\r\nrecognition included from the beginning the right of either belligerent\r\nto punish carriage of contraband on the sea. And the reason obviously is\r\nthe necessity for belligerents in the interest of self-preservation to\r\nprevent the import of such articles as may strengthen the enemy, and to\r\nconfiscate the contraband cargo, and eventually the vessel also, as a\r\ndeterrent to other vessels.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 830: See above, § 296.]\r\n\r\nThe present condition of the matter of carriage of contraband[831] is\r\ntherefore a compromise. In the interest of the generally recognised\r\nprinciple of freedom of commerce between belligerents and subjects of\r\nneutrals, International Law does not require neutrals to prevent their\r\nsubjects from carrying contraband; on the other hand, International Law\r\nempowers either belligerent to prohibit and punish carriage of\r\ncontraband just as it--see above, § 383--empowers either belligerent to\r\nprohibit and punish breach of blockade.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 831: The same applies to blockade-running and rendering\r\nunneutral service.]\r\n\r\nThe Declaration of London has in no way altered the existing condition\r\nof the matter. The fact that articles 22 and 24 give a list of articles\r\nwhich, without special declaration and notice, may always be treated as\r\nabsolute and conditional contraband respectively, does not involve the\r\nforbidding by International Law of the carriage of the articles.\r\nArticles 22 and 24 are certainly part of International Law, yet they\r\nmerely embody an agreement as to what goods may--but they need not--be\r\ntreated as contraband.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Direct Carriage of Contraband.]\r\n\r\n§ 399. Carriage of contraband commonly occurs where a vessel is engaged\r\nin carrying to an enemy port such goods as are contraband when they have\r\na hostile destination. In such cases it makes no difference whether the\r\nfact that the vessel is destined for an enemy port becomes apparent from\r\nher papers, she being bound to such port, or whether she is found at sea\r\nsailing on a course for an enemy port, although her papers show her to\r\nbe bound to a neutral port. And, further, it makes no difference,\r\naccording to the hitherto prevailing practice of Great Britain and the\r\nUnited States of America at any rate, that she is bound to a neutral\r\nport and that the articles concerned are, according to her papers,\r\ndestined for a neutral port, if only she is to call at an intermediate\r\nenemy port or is to meet enemy naval forces at sea in the course of her\r\nvoyage to the neutral port of destination;[832] for otherwise the door\r\nwould be open to deceit, and it would always be pretended that goods\r\nwhich a vessel is engaged in carrying to such intermediate enemy places\r\nwere intended for the neutral port of ultimate destination. For the same\r\nreason a vessel carrying such articles as are contraband when they have\r\na hostile destination is considered to be carrying contraband if her\r\npapers show that her destination is dependent upon contingencies under\r\nwhich she may have to call at an enemy port, unless she proves that she\r\nhas abandoned the intention of eventually calling there.[833]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 832: See Holland, _Prize Law_, § 69.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 833: The _Imina_ (1800), 3 C. Rob. 167; and the _Trende\r\nSostre_ (1800), cited in the _Lisette_ (1806), 6 C. Rob. 391, note. See\r\nalso Holland, _Prize Law_, § 70.]\r\n\r\nThe Declaration of London distinguishes between carriage of absolute and\r\nconditional contraband:--\r\n\r\nAs regards _absolute_ contraband, a vessel is, according to article 32,\r\nconsidered to be carrying contraband whether the fact that she is\r\ndestined for an enemy port becomes evident from her papers, she being\r\nbound for such port, or whether she is found at sea sailing for an enemy\r\nport, although her papers show her to be bound for a neutral port. And,\r\naccording to article 31, No. 2, it makes no difference that the vessel\r\nis bound for a neutral port and that the articles concerned are,\r\naccording to her papers, destined for a neutral port, if only she is to\r\ntouch at an intermediate enemy port or is to meet armed forces of the\r\nenemy before reaching the neutral port for which the goods in question\r\nare consigned.\r\n\r\nAs regards _conditional_ contraband, a vessel is, according to article\r\n35, considered to be carrying contraband whether her papers show her to\r\nbe destined to an enemy port, or, being clearly found out of the course\r\nto a neutral port indicated by her papers, she is unable to give\r\nadequate reasons to justify such deviation.\r\n\r\nArticle 32 as well as article 35 stipulates that ship papers are\r\nconclusive proof as to the destination of the vessel and of the cargo,\r\nunless the vessel is clearly found out of the course indicated by her\r\npapers, but the Report of the Drafting Committee of the Naval Conference\r\nof London emphasises the fact that the rule of the conclusiveness of\r\nship papers must not be interpreted too literally, since otherwise fraud\r\nwould be made easy. Ship papers are conclusive proof--says the\r\nReport--_unless facts show their evidence to be false_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Circuitous Carriage of Contraband.]\r\n\r\n§ 400. On occasions a neutral vessel carrying such articles as are\r\ncontraband if they have a hostile destination is, according to her\r\npapers, ostensibly bound for a neutral port, but is intended, after\r\nhaving called and eventually having delivered her cargo there, to carry\r\nthe same cargo from there to an enemy port. There is, of course, no\r\ndoubt that such vessels are carrying contraband whilst engaged in\r\ncarrying the articles concerned from the neutral to the enemy port. But\r\nduring the American Civil War the question arose whether they may\r\nalready be considered to be carrying contraband when on their way from\r\nthe port of starting to the neutral port from which they are afterwards\r\nto carry the cargo to an enemy port, since they are really intended to\r\ncarry the cargo from the port of starting to an enemy port, although not\r\ndirectly, but circuitously, by a roundabout way. The American Prize\r\nCourts answered the question in the affirmative by applying to the\r\ncarriage of contraband the principle of _dolus non purgatur circuitu_\r\nand the so-called doctrine of continuous voyages.[834] This attitude of\r\nthe American Prize Courts has called forth protests from many\r\nauthorities,[835] British as well as foreign, but Great Britain has not\r\nprotested, and from the attitude of the British Government in the case\r\nof the _Bundesrath_ and other vessels in 1900 during the South African\r\nWar it could safely, although indirectly only, be concluded that Great\r\nBritain considered the practice of the American Prize Courts correct and\r\njust, and that, when a belligerent, she intended to apply the same\r\nprinciples. This could also be inferred from § 71 of Holland's _Manual\r\nof Naval Prize Law_, which established the rule: \"The ostensible\r\ndestination of a vessel is sometimes a neutral port, while she is in\r\nreality intended, after touching, and even landing and colourably\r\ndelivering over her cargo there, to proceed with the same cargo to an\r\nenemy port. In such a case the voyage is held to be 'continuous,' and\r\nthe destination is held to be hostile throughout.\" And provided that the\r\nintention of the vessel is really to carry the cargo circuitously, by a\r\nroundabout way, to an enemy port, and further provided, that a mere\r\nsuspicion is not held for a proof of such intention, I cannot see why\r\nthis application of the doctrine of continuous voyages should not be\r\nconsidered reasonable, just, and adequate.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 834: The so-called doctrine of continuous voyages dates from\r\nthe time of the Anglo-French wars at the end of the eighteenth century,\r\nand is connected with the application of the so-called rule of 1756.\r\n(See above, § 289.) Neutral vessels engaged in French and Spanish\r\ncolonial trade, thrown open to them during the war, sought to evade\r\nseizure by British cruisers and condemnation by British Prize Courts,\r\naccording to the rule of 1756, by taking their cargo to a neutral port,\r\nlanding it and paying import duties there, and then re-lading it and\r\ncarrying it to the mother country of the respective colony. Thus in the\r\ncase of the _William_ (1806), 5 C. Rob. 385, it was proved that this\r\nneutral vessel took a cargo from the Spanish port La Guira to the port\r\nof Marblehead in Massachusetts--the United States being neutral--landed\r\nthe cargo, paid import duties there, then took in the chief part of this\r\ncargo besides other goods, and sailed after a week for the Spanish port\r\nof Bilbao. In all such cases the British Prize Courts considered the\r\nvoyages from the colonial port to the neutral port and from there to the\r\nenemy port as one continuous voyage and confirmed the seizure of the\r\nships concerned. See Remy, _Théorie de la continuauté du voyage en\r\nmatière de blocus et de contrebande_ (1902); Hansemann, _Die Lehre von\r\nder einheitlichen Reise im Rechte der Blockade und Kriegskonterbande_\r\n(1910), and Fauchille in _R.G._ IV. (1897), pp. 297-323. The American\r\nCourts have applied the doctrine of continuous voyages not only to\r\ncarriage of contraband but also to blockade; see above, § 385 (4), where\r\nthe cases of the _Bermuda_ and the _Stephen Hart_ are quoted.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 835: See, for instance, Hall, § 247. But Phillimore, III. §\r\n227, p. 391, says of the judgments of the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates in the cases of the _Bermuda_ and the _Peterhoff_, that they\r\n\"contain very valuable and sound expositions of the law, professedly,\r\nand for the most part really, in harmony with the earlier decisions of\r\nEnglish Prize Courts.\" On the other hand, Phillimore, III. § 298, p.\r\n490, disagrees with the American Courts regarding the application of the\r\ndoctrine of continuous voyages to breach of blockade, and reprobates the\r\ndecision in the case of the _Springbok_.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Indirect Carriage of Contraband (Doctrine of Continuous\r\nTransports).]\r\n\r\n§ 401. It also happens in war that neutral vessels carry to neutral\r\nports such articles as are contraband if bound for a hostile\r\ndestination, the vessel being cognisant or not of the fact that\r\narrangements have been made for the articles to be afterwards brought by\r\nland or sea into the hands of the enemy. And the question has arisen\r\nwhether such vessels on their voyage to the neutral port may be\r\nconsidered to be carrying contraband of war.[836] As early as 1855,\r\nduring the Crimean War, the French Conseil-Général des Prises, in\r\ncondemning the cargo of saltpetre of the Hanoverian neutral vessel _Vrow\r\nHouwina_, answered the question in the affirmative;[837] but it was not\r\nuntil the American Civil War that the question was decided on principle.\r\nSince from the British port of Nassau, in the Bahamas, and from other\r\nneutral ports near the coast of the Confederate States, goods, first\r\nbrought to these nearer neutral ports by vessels coming from more\r\ndistant neutral ports were carried to the blockaded coast of the\r\nSouthern States, Federal cruisers seized several vessels destined and\r\nactually on their voyage to Nassau and other neutral ports because all\r\nor parts of their cargoes were ultimately destined for the enemy. And\r\nthe American Courts considered those vessels to be carrying contraband,\r\nalthough they were sailing from one neutral port to another, on clear\r\nproof that the goods concerned were destined to be transported by land\r\nor sea from the neutral port of landing into the enemy territory. The\r\nleading cases are those of the _Springbok_ and _Peterhoff_, which have\r\nbeen mentioned above in § 385 (4), for the Courts found the seizure of\r\nthese and other vessels justified on the ground of carriage of\r\ncontraband as well as on the ground of breach of blockade. Thus, another\r\napplication of the doctrine of continuous voyages came into existence,\r\nsince vessels whilst sailing between two neutral ports could only be\r\nconsidered to be carrying contraband when the transport first from one\r\nneutral port to another and afterwards from the latter to the enemy\r\nterritory had been regarded as one continuous voyage. This application\r\nof the doctrine of continuous voyages is fitly termed \"doctrine of\r\ncontinuous transports.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 836: The question is treated with special regard to the case\r\nof the _Bundesrath_, in two able articles in _The Law Quarterly Review_,\r\nXVII. (1901), under the titles \"The Seizure of the _Bundesrath_\" (Mr. I.\r\nDundas White) and \"Contraband Goods and Neutral Ports\" (Mr. E. L. de\r\nHart). See also Baty, _International Law in South Africa_ (1900), pp.\r\n1-44.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 837: See Calvo, V. § 2767, p. 52. The case of the Swedish\r\nneutral vessel _Commercen_, which occurred in 1814, and which is\r\nfrequently quoted with that of the _Vrow Houwina_ (1 Wheaton, 382), is\r\nnot a case of indirect carriage of contraband. The _Commercen_ was on\r\nher way to Bilbao, in Spain, carrying a cargo of provisions for the\r\nEnglish army in Spain, and she was captured by a privateer commissioned\r\nby the United States of America, which was then at war with England.\r\nWhen the case, in 1816, came before Mr. Justice Story, he reprobated the\r\nargument that the seizure was not justified because a vessel could not\r\nbe considered to be carrying contraband when on her way to a neutral\r\nport, and he asserted that the hostile destination of goods was\r\nsufficient to justify the seizure of the vessel.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Case of the _Bundesrath_.]\r\n\r\n§ 402. This application of the doctrine of continuous voyages under the\r\nnew form of continuous transports has likewise been condemned by many\r\nBritish and foreign authorities; but Great Britain did not protest in\r\nthis case either--on the contrary, as was mentioned above in § 385 (4),\r\nshe declined to interfere in favour of the British owners of the vessels\r\nand cargoes concerned. And that she really considered the practice of\r\nthe American Courts just and sound became clearly apparent by her\r\nattitude during the South African War. When, in 1900, the _Bundesrath_,\r\n_Herzog_, and _General_, German vessels sailing from German neutral\r\nports to the Portuguese neutral port of Lorenzo Marques in Delagoa Bay,\r\nwere seized by British cruisers under the suspicion of carrying\r\ncontraband, Germany demanded their release, maintaining that no carriage\r\nof contraband could be said to take place by vessels sailing from one\r\nneutral port to another. But Great Britain refused to admit this\r\nprinciple, maintaining that articles ultimately destined for the enemy\r\nwere contraband, although the vessels carrying them were bound for a\r\nneutral port.[838]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 838: See _Parliamentary Papers_, Africa, No. 1 (1900);\r\nCorrespondence respecting the action of H.M.'s naval authorities with\r\nregard to certain foreign vessels.]\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that this attitude of the British Government was\r\ncontrary to the opinion of the prominent English[839] writers on\r\nInternational Law. Even the _Manual of Naval Prize Law_, edited by\r\nProfessor Holland[840] in 1888, and \"issued by authority of the Lords\r\nCommissioners of the Admiralty,\" reprobated the American practice, for\r\nin § 72 it lays down the following rule: \"... If the destination of the\r\nvessel be neutral, then the destination of the goods on board should be\r\nconsidered neutral, notwithstanding it may appear from the papers or\r\notherwise that the goods themselves have an ulterior destination by\r\ntranshipment, overland conveyance, or otherwise.\" And the practice of\r\nBritish Prize Courts in the past would seem to have been in accordance\r\nwith this rule. In 1798, during war between England and the Netherlands,\r\nthe neutral ship _Imina_,[841] which had left the neutral port of\r\nDantzig for Amsterdam carrying ship's timber, but on hearing of the\r\nblockade of Amsterdam by the British had changed her course for the\r\nneutral port of Emden, was seized on her voyage to Emden by a British\r\ncruiser; she was, however, released by Sir William Scott because she had\r\nno intention of breaking blockade, and because a vessel could only be\r\nconsidered as carrying contraband whilst on a voyage to an enemy port.\r\n\"The rule respecting contraband, as I have always understood it, is that\r\nthe articles must be taken _in delicto_, in the actual prosecution of\r\nthe voyage to an enemy port,\" said Sir William Scott.[842]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 839: See, for instance, Hall, § 247, and Twiss in _The Law\r\nMagazine and Review_, XII. (1877), pp. 130-158.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 840: In a letter to the _Times_ of January 3, 1900, Professor\r\nHolland points out that circumstances had so altered since 1888 that the\r\nattitude of the British Government in the case of the _Bundesrath_ was\r\nquite justified; see Holland, _Letters to the \"Times\" upon War and\r\nNeutrality_ (1909), pp. 114-119.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 841: 3 C. Rob. 167.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 842: It is frequently maintained--see Phillimore, III. § 227,\r\npp. 397-403--that in 1864, in the case of _Hobbs_ v. _Henning_, Lord\r\nChief Justice Erle repudiated the doctrine of continuous transports, but\r\nWestlake shows that this is not the case. See Westlake's Introduction in\r\nTakahashi, _International Law during the Chino-Japanese War_ (1899), pp.\r\nxx-xxiii, and in _The Law Quarterly_ _Review_, XV.

Although the majority of Continental writers condemn the doctrine\r\nof continuous transports, several eminent Continental authorities\r\nsupport it. Thus, Gessner (p. 119) emphatically asserts that the\r\ndestination of the carrying vessel is of no importance compared with the\r\ndestination of the carried goods themselves. Bluntschli, although he\r\ncondemns in § 835 the American practice regarding breach of blockade\r\ncommitted by a vessel sailing from one neutral port to another,\r\nexpressly approves in § 813 of the American practice regarding carriage\r\nof contraband by a vessel sailing between two neutral ports, yet\r\ncarrying goods with a hostile destination. Kleen (I. § 95, p. 388)\r\ncondemns the rule that the neutral destination of the vessel makes the\r\ngoods appear likewise neutral, and defends seizure in the case of a\r\nhostile destination of the goods on a vessel sailing between two neutral\r\nports; he expressly states that such goods are contraband from the\r\nmoment the carrying vessel leaves the port of loading. Fiore (III. No.\r\n1649) reprobates the theory of continuous voyages as applied by British\r\nand American Courts, but he asserts nevertheless that the hostile\r\ndestination of certain goods carried by a vessel sailing to a neutral\r\nport justifies the vessel being regarded as carrying contraband, and the\r\nseizure thereof. Bonfils (No. 1569) takes up the same standpoint as\r\nBluntschli, admitting the application of the theory of continuous\r\nvoyages to carriage of contraband, but reprobating its application to\r\nbreach of blockade. And the Institute of International Law adopted the\r\nrule:[843] \"_La destination pour l'ennemi est présumée lorsque le\r\ntransport va à l'un de ses ports, ou bien à un port neutre qui,\r\nd'après_ _des preuves évidentes et de fait incontestable, n'est qu'une\r\nétape pour l'ennemi, comme but final de la même opération commerciale._\"\r\nThus this representative body of authorities of all nations has fully\r\nadopted the American application of the doctrine of continuous voyages\r\nto contraband, and thereby recognised the possibility of circuitous as\r\nwell as indirect carriage of contraband.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 843: See § 1 of the _Règlementation internationale de la\r\ncontrebande de guerre_, _Annuaire_, XV. (1896), p. 230.]\r\n\r\nAnd it must be mentioned that the attitude of several Continental States\r\nhas hitherto been in favour of the American practice. Thus, according to\r\n§§ 4 and 6 of the Prussian Regulations of 1864 regarding Naval Prizes,\r\nit was the hostile destination of the goods or the destination of the\r\nvessel to an enemy port which made a vessel appear as carrying\r\ncontraband and which justified her seizure. In Sweden the same was\r\nvalid.[844] Thus, further, an Italian Prize Court during the war with\r\nAbyssinia in 1896 justified the seizure in the Red Sea of the Dutch\r\nvessel _Doelwijk_,[845] which sailed for the neutral French port of\r\nDjibouti, carrying a cargo of arms and ammunition destined for the\r\nAbyssinian army and to be transported to Abyssinia after having been\r\nlanded at Djibouti.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 844: See Kleen, I. p. 389, note 2.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 845: See Martens, _N.R.G._ 2nd Ser. XXVIII. p. 66. See also\r\nbelow, § 436.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Partial Recognition by the Declaration of London of the\r\nDoctrine of Continuous Voyages.]\r\n\r\n§ 403_a_. The Declaration of London offers a compromise in order to\r\nsettle the controversy respecting the application of the doctrine of\r\ncontinuous voyages to the carriage of contraband, whether circuitous or\r\nindirect carriage be concerned.\r\n\r\n(1) On the one hand, article 30 recognises with regard to _absolute_\r\ncontraband the application of the doctrine of continuous voyages--both\r\nto circuitous and indirect carriage of contraband--by enacting that:\r\n\"absolute contraband is liable to capture if it is shown to be destined\r\nto territory belonging to or occupied by the enemy or to the armed\r\nforces of the enemy. _It is_ _immaterial whether the carriage of the\r\ngoods is direct or entails transhipment or a subsequent transport by\r\nland._\"\r\n\r\n(2) On the other hand, article 35 categorically rejects the doctrine of\r\ncontinuous voyages with regard to _conditional_ contraband by enacting\r\nthat \"conditional contraband is not liable to capture except when found\r\non board a vessel bound for territory belonging to or occupied by the\r\nenemy, or for the armed forces of the enemy,[846] and when it is not to\r\nbe discharged in an intervening neutral port.\"\r\n\r\n(3) However, in cases where the enemy country has no seaboard, article\r\n36--in contradistinction to the provisions of article 35--expressly\r\nrecognises the doctrine of continuous voyages for _conditional_\r\ncontraband also by enacting that \"notwithstanding the provisions of\r\narticle 35, conditional contraband, if shown to have the destination\r\nreferred to in article 33, is liable to capture in cases where the enemy\r\ncountry has no seaboard.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 846: The rule of article 35 came into question for the first\r\ntime during the Turco-Italian war. In January 1912, the _Carthage_, a\r\nFrench mail-steamer plying between Marseilles and Tunis, was captured\r\nfor carriage of contraband by an Italian torpedo-boat and taken to\r\nCagliari, because she had an aeroplane destined for Tunis on board. As\r\nthe destination of the vessel was neutral, and as, according to article\r\n24, No. 8, of the Declaration of London aeroplanes are conditional\r\ncontraband, France protested against the capture of the vessel, Italy\r\nagreed to release her, and the parties arranged to have the question as\r\nto whether the capture of the vessel was justified settled by the\r\nPermanent Court of Arbitration at the Hague.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nCONSEQUENCES OF CARRIAGE OF CONTRABAND\r\n\r\n  See the literature quoted above at the commencement of § 391.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Capture for Carriage of Contraband.]\r\n\r\n§ 404. It has always been universally recognised by theory and practice\r\nthat a vessel carrying contraband may be seized by the cruisers of the\r\nbelligerent concerned. But seizure is allowed only so long as a vessel\r\nis _in delicto_, which commences when she leaves the port of starting\r\nand ends when she has deposited the contraband goods, whether with the\r\nenemy or otherwise. The rule is generally recognised, therefore, that a\r\nvessel which has deposited her contraband may not be seized on her\r\nreturn voyage. British and American practice, however, has hitherto\r\nadmitted one exception to this rule--namely, in the case in which a\r\nvessel has carried contraband on her outward voyage with simulated and\r\nfalse papers.[847] But no exception has been admitted by the practice of\r\nother countries. Thus, when in 1879, during war between Peru and Chili,\r\nthe German vessel _Luxor_, after having carried a cargo of arms and\r\nammunition from Monte Video to Valparaiso, was seized in the harbour of\r\nCallao, in Peru, and condemned by the Peruvian Prize Courts for carrying\r\ncontraband, Germany interfered and succeeded in getting the vessel\r\nreleased.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 847: The _Nancy_ (1800), 3 C. Rob. 122; the _Margaret_ (1810),\r\n1 Acton, 333. See Holland, _Prize Law_, § 80. Wheaton, I. § 506, note 2,\r\ncondemns this practice; Hall, § 247, p. 696, calls it \"undoubtedly\r\nsevere\"; Halleck, II. p. 220, defends it. See also Calvo, V. §§\r\n2756-2758.]\r\n\r\nIt must be specially observed that seizure for carriage of contraband is\r\nonly admissible on the Open Sea and in the maritime territorial belts of\r\nthe belligerents. Seizure within the maritime belt of neutrals would be\r\na violation of neutrality.\r\n\r\nThe Declaration of London entirely confirms these old customary rules,\r\nbut does not recognise the above-mentioned British exception. Article 37\r\nenacts that a vessel carrying goods liable to capture as absolute or\r\nconditional contraband may be captured on the high seas or in the\r\nterritorial waters of the belligerents throughout the whole of her\r\nvoyage even if she is to touch at a port of call before reaching the\r\nhostile destination. Article 38 enacts that a vessel may not be captured\r\non the ground that she has carried contraband on a previous occasion if\r\nsuch carriage is in point of fact at an end.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Penalty for Carriage of Contraband according to the Practice\r\nhitherto prevailing.]\r\n\r\n§ 405. In former times neither in theory nor in practice have similar\r\nrules been recognised with regard to the penalty of carriage of\r\ncontraband. The penalty was frequently confiscation not only of the\r\ncontraband cargo itself, but also of all other parts of the cargo,\r\ntogether with the vessel. Only France made an exception, since according\r\nto an _ordonnance_ of 1584 she did not even confiscate the contraband\r\ngoods themselves, but only seized them against payment of their value,\r\nand it was not until 1681 that an _ordonnance_ proclaimed confiscation\r\nof contraband, but with exclusion of the vessel and the innocent part of\r\nthe cargo.[848] During the seventeenth century this distinction between\r\ncontraband on the one hand, and, on the other, the innocent goods and\r\nthe vessel was clearly recognised by Zouche and Bynkershoek, and\r\nconfiscation of the contraband only became more and more the rule,\r\ncertain cases excepted. During the eighteenth century the right to\r\nconfiscate contraband was frequently contested, and it is remarkable as\r\nregards the change of attitude of some States that by article 13 of the\r\nTreaty of Friendship and Commerce[849] concluded in 1785 between Prussia\r\nand the United States of America all confiscation was abolished. This\r\narticle provided that the belligerent should have the right to stop\r\nvessels carrying contraband and to detain them for such length of time\r\nas might be necessary to prevent possible damage by them, but such\r\ndetained vessels should be paid compensation for the arrest imposed upon\r\nthem. It further provided that the belligerent could seize all\r\ncontraband against payment of its full value, and that, if the captain\r\nof a vessel stopped for carrying contraband should deliver up all\r\ncontraband, the vessel should at once be set free. I doubt whether any\r\nother treaty of the same kind was entered into by either Prussia or the\r\nUnited States.[850] And it is certain that, if any rule regarding\r\npenalty for carriage of contraband was generally recognised at all, it\r\nwas the rule that contraband goods could be confiscated. But there\r\nalways remained the difficulty that it was controversial what articles\r\nwere contraband, and that the practice of States varied much regarding\r\nthe question as to whether the vessel herself and innocent cargo carried\r\nby her could be confiscated. For beyond the rule that absolute\r\ncontraband could be confiscated, there was no unanimity regarding the\r\nfate of the vessel and the innocent part of the cargo. Great Britain and\r\nthe United States of America hitherto confiscated the vessel when the\r\nowner of the contraband was also the owner of the vessel; they also\r\nconfiscated such part of the innocent cargo as belonged to the owner of\r\nthe contraband goods; they, lastly, confiscated the vessel, although her\r\nowner was not the owner of the contraband, provided he knew of the fact\r\nthat his vessel was carrying contraband, or provided the vessel sailed\r\nwith false or simulated papers for the purpose of carrying\r\ncontraband.[851] Some States allowed such vessel carrying contraband as\r\nwas not herself liable to confiscation to proceed with her voyage on\r\ndelivery of her contraband goods to the seizing cruiser,[852] but Great\r\nBritain[853] and other States insisted upon the vessel being brought\r\nbefore a Prize Court in every case.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 848: See Wheaton, _Histoire des Progrès du Droit des gens en\r\nEurope_ (1841), p. 82.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 849: Martens, _R._ IV. p. 42.

According to British\r\npractice[854] hitherto prevailing, freight was paid to the vessel, and\r\nthe usual compensation for the conditional contraband was the cost price\r\nplus 10 per cent. profit. States acting in this way asserted a right to\r\nconfiscate conditional contraband, but exercised pre-emption in\r\nmitigation of such a right. Those Continental writers who refused to\r\nrecognise the existence of conditional contraband, denied, consequently,\r\nthat there was a right to confiscate articles not absolutely contraband,\r\nbut they maintained that every belligerent had, according to the\r\nso-called right of angary,[855] a right to stop all such neutral vessels\r\nas carried provisions and other goods with a hostile destination of\r\nwhich he might have made use and to seize such goods against payment of\r\ntheir full value.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 854: See Holland, _Prize Law_, § 84. Great Britain likewise\r\nexercised pre-emption instead of confiscation with regard to such\r\nabsolute contraband as was in an unmanufactured condition and was at the\r\nsame time the produce of the country exporting it.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 855: See above, § 365.]\r\n\r\nThe Institute of International Law, whose rules regarding contraband,\r\nadopted at its meeting at Venice in 1896, restrict contraband to arms,\r\nammunition, articles of military equipment, vessels fitted for naval\r\noperations, and instruments for the immediate fabrication of ammunition,\r\nproposed a compromise regarding articles of ancipitous use. Although the\r\nrules state that those articles may not be considered contraband, they\r\nnevertheless give the choice to a belligerent of either exercising\r\npre-emption or seizing and temporarily retaining such articles against\r\npayment of indemnities.[856]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 856: It is of value to print here the _Règlementation\r\ninternationale de la contrebande de guerre_ adopted by the Institute of\r\nInternational Law (_Annuaire_, XV.

Sous la dénomination de _munitions de guerre_ doivent être compris\r\nles objets qui, pour servir immédiatement à la guerre, n'exigent qu'une\r\nsimple réunion ou juxtaposition.\r\n\r\n§ 3. Un objet ne saurait être qualifié de contrebande à raison de la\r\nseule intention de l'employer à aider ou favoriser un ennemi, ni par\r\ncela seul qu'il pourrait être, dans un but militaire, utile à un ennemi\r\nou utilisé par lui, ou qu'il est destiné à son usage.\r\n\r\n§ 4. Sont et demeurent abolies les prétendues contrebandes désignées\r\nsous les noms soit de contrebande _relative_, concernant des articles\r\n(_usus ancipitis_) susceptibles d'être utilisés par un belligérant dans\r\nun but militaire, mais dont l'usage est essentiellement pacifique, soit\r\nde contrebande _accidentelle_, quand lesdits articles ne servent\r\nspécialement aux buts militaires que dans une circonstance particulière.\r\n\r\n§ 5. Néanmoins le belligérant a, à son choix et à charge d'une équitable\r\nindemnité, le droit de séquestre ou de préemption quant aux objets qui,\r\nen chemin vers un port de son adversaire, peuvent également servir à\r\nl'usage de la guerre et à des usages pacifiques.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n§ 9.

The Declaration of London offers by articles 39 to 44 a\r\nsettlement of the controversy respecting the penalty for carriage of\r\ncontraband which represents a fair compromise.\r\n\r\nThe chief rule is (article 39) that contraband goods, whether absolute\r\nor conditional contraband, may be confiscated. The carrying vessel may\r\n(article 40) likewise be confiscated if the contraband reckoned either\r\nby value, weight, volume, or freight, forms more than half the cargo. If\r\nthe latter be not the case, and if the carrying vessel be therefore\r\nreleased, she may (article 41) be condemned to pay the costs and\r\nexpenses incurred by the captor in respect of the proceedings in the\r\nnational Prize Court and the custody of the ship and cargo during the\r\nproceedings. But whatever be the proportion between contraband and\r\ninnocent goods on a vessel, innocent goods (article 42) which belong to\r\nthe owner of the contraband and are on board the same carrying vessel,\r\nmay be confiscated.\r\n\r\nIf a vessel carrying contraband sails before the outbreak of war\r\n(article 43), or is unaware of a declaration of contraband which applies\r\nto her cargo, or has no opportunity of discharging her cargo after\r\nreceiving such knowledge, the contraband may only be confiscated on\r\npayment of compensation, and the vessel herself and her innocent cargo\r\nmay not be confiscated nor may the vessel be condemned to pay any costs\r\nand expenses incurred by the captor.[857] But there is a presumption\r\nwhich is not rebuttable with regard to the _mens rea_ of the vessel. For\r\naccording to the second paragraph of article 43 a vessel is considered\r\nto have knowledge of the outbreak of war or of a declaration of\r\ncontraband if she leaves an enemy port after the outbreak of\r\nhostilities, or if she leaves a neutral port subsequent to the\r\nnotification of the outbreak of hostilities or of the declaration of\r\ncontraband to the Power to which such port belongs, provided such\r\nnotification was made in sufficient time.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 857: It is obvious that the vessel must be brought into a port\r\nand before a Prize Court if the captor desires to seize the contraband\r\nagainst compensation. The question as to whether article 44 applies to\r\nsuch a case, and whether, therefore, the neutral vessel may be allowed\r\nto continue her voyage if the master is willing to hand over the\r\ncontraband to the captor, must be answered in the affirmative, provided\r\nthat the contraband, reckoned either by value, weight, volume, or\r\nfreight, forms less than half the cargo. For article 44 precisely treats\r\nof a case in which the vessel herself is not liable to condemnation _on\r\naccount of the proportion of the contraband on board_ (see article 40).]\r\n\r\nThe question of pre-emption of conditional contraband is not mentioned\r\nby the Declaration of London. There is, however, nothing to prevent the\r\nseveral maritime Powers from exercising pre-emption in mitigation of\r\ntheir right of confiscation; the future must show whether or no they\r\nwill be inclined to do this.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Seizure of Contraband without Seizure of the Vessel.]\r\n\r\n§ 406_a_. Hitherto the practice of the several States has differed--see\r\nabove, § 405--with regard to the question as to whether a vessel which\r\nwas not herself liable to condemnation might be allowed to proceed on\r\nher voyage on condition that she handed over the contraband carried by\r\nher to the captor. Great Britain and some other States answered it in\r\nthe negative, but several States in the affirmative. The Declaration of\r\nLondon, although it upholds the general rule that, whatever may be the\r\nultimate fate of the vessel, she must be taken into a port of a Prize\r\nCourt, admits two exceptions to the rule:--\r\n\r\n(1) According to article 44, a vessel which has been stopped for\r\ncarrying contraband and which is not herself liable to be confiscated on\r\naccount of the proportion of contraband on board, may--not must--when\r\nthe circumstances permit it, be allowed to continue her voyage in case\r\nshe hands over the contraband cargo to the captor. In such a case the\r\ncaptor is at liberty to destroy the contraband handed over to him. But\r\nthe matter must in any case be brought before a Prize Court. The captor\r\nmust therefore enter the delivery of the contraband on the log-book of\r\nthe vessel so stopped, and the master of the latter must give duly\r\ncertified copies of all relevant papers to the captor.\r\n\r\n(2) According to article 54, the captor may--see below, §\r\n431--exceptionally, in case of necessity, demand the handing over, or\r\nmay proceed himself to the destruction, of any absolute or conditional\r\ncontraband goods found on a vessel which is not herself liable to\r\ncondemnation, if the taking of the vessel into the port of a Prize Court\r\nwould involve danger to the safety of the capturing cruiser or to the\r\nsuccess of the operations in which she is engaged at the time. But the\r\ncaptor must, nevertheless, bring the case before a Prize Court. He must,\r\ntherefore, enter the captured goods on the log-book of the stopped\r\nvessel, and must obtain duly certified copies of all relevant papers. If\r\nthe captor cannot establish the fact before the Prize Court that he was\r\nreally compelled to abandon the intention of bringing in the carrying\r\nvessel, he must be condemned (see article 51) to pay the value of the\r\ngoods to their owners if the goods were contraband or if they were not.\r\nAnd the same is valid in case (article 52) the seizure or destruction of\r\nthe goods is held by the Prize Court to have been justifiable, but not\r\nthe capture itself of the carrying vessel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nUNNEUTRAL SERVICE\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTHE DIFFERENT KINDS OF UNNEUTRAL SERVICE\r\n\r\n  Hall, §§ 248-253--Lawrence, §§ 260-262--Westlake, II. pp.\r\n  261-265--Phillimore, III. §§ 271-274--Halleck, II. pp.\r\n  289-301--Taylor, §§ 667-673--Walker, § 72--Wharton, III. §\r\n  374--Wheaton, §§ 502-504 and Dana's note No. 228--Moore, VII. §§\r\n  1264-1265--Bluntschli, §§ 815-818--Heffter, § 161A--Geffcken in\r\n  Holtzendorff, IV. pp. 731-738--Ullmann, § 192--Bonfils, Nos.\r\n  1584-1588--Despagnet, Nos. 716-716 _bis_--Rivier, II. pp.\r\n  388-391--Nys, III. pp. 675-681--Calvo, V. §§ 2796-2820--Fiore,\r\n  III.

Before the Declaration of London the term _unneutral service_ was\r\nused by several writers with reference to the carriage of certain\r\npersons and despatches for the enemy on the part of neutral vessels. The\r\nterm has been introduced in order to distinguish the carriage of persons\r\nand despatches for the enemy from the carriage of contraband, as these\r\nwere often confounded with each other. Since contraband consists of\r\ncertain goods only and never of persons or despatches, a vessel carrying\r\npersons and despatches for the enemy is not thereby actually carrying\r\ncontraband.[858] And there is another important difference between the\r\ntwo. Carriage of contraband need not necessarily, and in most cases\r\nactually does not, take place in the direct service of the enemy. On the\r\nother hand, carriage of persons and despatches for the enemy always\r\ntakes place in the direct service of the enemy, and, consequently,\r\nrepresents a much more intensive assistance of, and a much more intimate\r\nconnection with, the enemy than carriage of contraband. For these\r\nreasons a distinct treatment of carriage of contraband, on the one hand,\r\nand carriage of persons and despatches, on the other, was certainly\r\nconsidered desirable by many publicists. Those writers who did not adopt\r\nthe term _unneutral service_, on account of its somewhat misleading\r\ncharacter, preferred[859] the expression _analogous of contraband_,\r\nbecause in practice maritime transport for the enemy was always treated\r\nin analogy with, although not as, carriage of contraband.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 858: This was recognised in the case of the _Yangtsze\r\nInsurance Association_ v. _Indemnity Mutual Marine Assurance Company_,\r\nL.R. (1908), 1 K.B. 910 and 2 K.B. 504.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 859: It was also preferred in the first edition of this work.\r\nBut it was necessary to abandon further resistance on account of the\r\nfact that after the official adoption, in the translation of the\r\nDeclaration of London, of the term _unneutral service_ it was useless to\r\noppose it.]\r\n\r\nThe Declaration of London puts the whole matter upon a new and very much\r\nenlarged basis, for Chapter III. treats in articles 45 to 47, under the\r\nheading _De l'assistance hostile_--the official English translation of\r\nwhich is _unneutral service_--not only of the carriage of persons for\r\nthe enemy on the part of a neutral vessel, but also of the transmission\r\nof intelligence in the interest of the enemy, the taking of a direct\r\npart in the hostilities, and a number of other acts on the part of a\r\nneutral vessel. Accordingly the Declaration of London makes a\r\ndistinction between two kinds of unneutral service, meting out for the\r\none a treatment analogous in a general way to contraband, and for the\r\nother a treatment analogous to that of enemy merchant vessels. Carriage\r\nof individual members of the armed forces of the enemy and a certain\r\ncase of transmission of intelligence in the interest of the enemy\r\nconstitute the first kind, and four groups of acts creating enemy\r\ncharacter for the vessel concerned constitute the second kind.[860]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 860: Although--see above, §§ 173 and 174--prevention of\r\nunneutral service to the enemy is a means of sea warfare, it chiefly\r\nconcerns neutral commerce, and is, therefore, more conveniently treated\r\nwith neutrality.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Carriage of Persons for the Enemy.]\r\n\r\n§ 408. Either belligerent may punish neutral vessels for carrying, in\r\nthe service of the enemy, certain persons.\r\n\r\nSuch persons included, according to the customary rules of International\r\nLaw hitherto prevailing, not only members of the armed forces of the\r\nenemy, but also individuals who were not yet members of the armed forces\r\nbut who would have become so as soon as they reached their place of\r\ndestination, and, thirdly, non-military individuals in the service of\r\nthe enemy either in such a prominent position that they could be made\r\nprisoners of war, or who were going abroad as agents for the purpose of\r\nfostering the cause of the enemy. Thus, for instance, if the head of the\r\nenemy State or one of his cabinet ministers fled the country to avoid\r\ncaptivity, the neutral vessel that carried him could have been punished,\r\nas could also the vessel carrying an agent of the enemy sent abroad to\r\nnegotiate a loan and the like. However, the mere fact that enemy persons\r\nwere on board a neutral vessel did not in itself prove that these\r\npersons were carried by the vessel for the enemy and in his service.\r\nThis was the case only when either the vessel knew of the character of\r\nthe persons and nevertheless carried them, thereby acting in the service\r\nof the enemy, or when the vessel was directly hired by the enemy for\r\nthe purpose of transport of the individuals concerned. Thus, for\r\ninstance, if able-bodied men booked their passages on a neutral vessel\r\nto an enemy port with the secret intention of enlisting in the forces of\r\nthe enemy, the vessel could not be considered as carrying persons for\r\nthe enemy; but she could be so considered if an agent of the enemy\r\nopenly booked their passages. Thus, further, if the fugitive head of the\r\nenemy State booked his passage under a false name, and concealed his\r\nidentity from the vessel, she could not be considered as carrying a\r\nperson for the enemy; but she could be so considered if she knew whom\r\nshe was carrying, because she was then aware that she was acting in the\r\nservice of the enemy. As regards a vessel directly hired by the enemy,\r\nthere could be no doubt that she was acting in the service of the enemy.\r\nThus the American vessel _Orozembo_[861] was in 1807, during war between\r\nEngland and the Netherlands, captured and condemned, because, although\r\nchartered by a merchant in Lisbon ostensibly to sail in ballast to Macao\r\nand to take from there a cargo to America, she received by order of the\r\ncharterer three Dutch officers and two Dutch civil servants, and sailed,\r\nnot to Macao, but to Batavia. And the American vessel _Friendship_[862]\r\nwas likewise in 1807, during war between England and France, captured\r\nand condemned, because she was hired by the French Government to carry\r\nninety shipwrecked officers and sailors home to a French port.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 861: 6 C. Rob. 430.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 862: 6 C. Rob. 420.]\r\n\r\nAccording to British practice hitherto prevailing, a neutral vessel was\r\nconsidered as carrying persons in the service of the enemy even if she\r\nwere, through the application of force, constrained by the enemy to\r\ncarry the persons, or if she were in _bona-fide_ ignorance of the status\r\nof her passengers. Thus, in 1802, during war between Great Britain and\r\nFrance, the Swedish vessel _Carolina_[863] was condemned by Sir William\r\nScott for having carried French troops from Egypt to Italy, although the\r\nmaster endeavoured to prove that the vessel was obliged by force to\r\nrender the transport service. And the above-mentioned vessel _Orozembo_\r\nwas condemned[864] by Sir William Scott, although her master was\r\nignorant of the service for the enemy on which he was engaged: \"... In\r\ncases of _bona-fide_ ignorance there may be no actual delinquency; but\r\nif the service is injurious, that will be sufficient to give the\r\nbelligerent a right to prevent the thing from being done or at least\r\nrepeated,\" said Sir William Scott.[865]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 863: 4 C. Rob. 256.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 864: See Phillimore, III. § 274, and Holland, _Prize Law_, §§\r\n90-91. Hall, § 249, p. 700, note 2, reprobates the British practice.\r\nDuring the Russo-Japanese War only one case of condemnation of a neutral\r\nvessel for carrying persons for the enemy is recorded, that of the\r\n_Nigretia_, a vessel which endeavoured to carry into Vladivostock the\r\nescaped captain and lieutenant of the Russian destroyer _Ratzoporni_;\r\nsee Takahashi, pp. 639-641.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 865: It should be mentioned that, according to the customary\r\nlaw hitherto prevailing, the case of diplomatic agents sent by the enemy\r\nto neutral States was an exception to the rule that neutral vessels may\r\nbe punished for carrying agents sent by the enemy. The importance of\r\nthis exception became apparent in the case of the _Trent_ which occurred\r\nduring the American War. On November 8, 1861, the Federal cruiser _San\r\nJacinto_ stopped the British mail steamer _Trent_ on her voyage from\r\nHavana to the British port of Nassau, in the Bahamas, forcibly took off\r\nMessrs. Mason and Slidell, together with their secretaries, political\r\nagents sent by the Confederate States to Great Britain and France, and\r\nthen let the vessel continue her voyage. Great Britain demanded their\r\nimmediate release, and the United States at once granted this, although\r\nthe ground on which release was granted was not identical with the\r\nground on which release was demanded. The Government of the United\r\nStates maintained that the removal of these men from the vessel without\r\nbringing her before a Prize Court for trial was irregular, and,\r\ntherefore, not justified, whereas release was demanded on the ground\r\nthat a neutral vessel could not be prevented from carrying diplomatic\r\nagents sent by the enemy to neutrals. Now diplomatic agents in the\r\nproper sense of the term these gentlemen were not, because although they\r\nwere sent by the Confederate States, the latter were not recognised as\r\nsuch, but only as a belligerent Power. Yet these gentlemen were\r\npolitical agents of a quasi-diplomatic character, and the standpoint of\r\nGreat Britain was for this reason perhaps correct. The fact that the\r\nGovernments of France, Austria, and Prussia protested through their\r\ndiplomatic envoys in Washington shows at least that neutral vessels may\r\ncarry unhindered diplomatic agents sent by the enemy to neutrals,\r\nhowever doubtful it may be whether the same is valid regarding agents\r\nwith a quasi-diplomatic character. See _Parliamentary Papers_, 1862,\r\nNorth America, N. 5; Marquardsen, _Der Trent Fall_ (1862); Wharton, §\r\n374; Moore, VII. § 1265; Phillimore, II. §§ 130-130A; Mountague Bernard,\r\n_Neutrality of Great Britain during the American Civil War_ (1870), pp.\r\n187-205; Harris, _The Trent Affair_ (1896).]\r\n\r\nAccording to the Declaration of London neutral merchantmen may, apart\r\nfrom the case of the carriage of persons who in the course of the voyage\r\ndirectly assist the operations of the enemy, only be considered to\r\nrender unneutral service by carrying such enemy persons as are actually\r\nalready members of the armed forces of the enemy. Article 45 makes it\r\nquite apparent, through using the words \"_embodied_ in the armed\r\nforces,\" that reservists and the like who are on their way to the enemy\r\ncountry for the purpose of there joining the armed forces, do not belong\r\nto such enemy persons as a neutral vessel may not carry without exposing\r\nherself to punishment for rendering unneutral service to the enemy. And\r\nfour different cases of carrying enemy persons must be distinguished\r\naccording to the Declaration of London, namely: that of a neutral vessel\r\nexclusively engaged in the transport of enemy troops; that of a vessel\r\ntransporting a military detachment of the enemy; that of a vessel\r\ntransporting one or more persons who in the course of the voyage\r\ndirectly assist the operations of the enemy; that of a vessel\r\ntransporting, on a voyage specially undertaken, individual members of\r\nthe armed forces of the enemy.\r\n\r\n(1) According to article 46, No. 4, a neutral vessel exclusively\r\nintended at the time for the transport of enemy troops acquires thereby\r\nenemy character. This case will be considered with others of the same\r\nkind below in § 410.\r\n\r\n(2) In case a vessel, although she is not exclusively therefor destined,\r\nand although she is not on a voyage specially undertaken for that\r\npurpose, transports, to the knowledge of either the owner or the\r\ncharterer or the master, a military detachment of the enemy, she is,\r\naccording to article 45, No. 2, considered to render unneutral service\r\nfor which she may be punished. Accordingly, if to the knowledge of\r\neither the owner or the charterer or the master, a neutral vessel _in\r\nthe ordinary course of her voyage_ carries a military detachment of the\r\nenemy, she is liable to be seized for unneutral service.\r\n\r\n(3) In case a neutral vessel, to the knowledge of either the owner or\r\nthe charterer or the master, carries one or more persons--subjects of\r\none of the belligerents or of a neutral Power--who in the course of the\r\nvoyage directly assist the operations of the enemy in any way, for\r\ninstance by signalling or sending message by wireless telegraphy, she\r\nis, according to article 45, No. 2, likewise liable to seizure for\r\nrendering unneutral service.\r\n\r\n(4) In case a neutral vessel carries individual members of the armed\r\nforces of the enemy, she is, according to article 45, No. 1, then only\r\nliable to seizure if she is on a voyage specially undertaken for such\r\ntransport, that means, if she has been turned from her ordinary course\r\nand has touched at a port outside her ordinary course for the purpose of\r\nembarking, or is going to touch at a port outside her ordinary course\r\nfor the purpose of disembarking, the enemy persons concerned. A liner,\r\ntherefore, carrying individual members of the armed forces of the enemy\r\nin the ordinary course of her voyage may not be considered to be\r\nrendering unneutral service and may not be seized. However, according to\r\narticle 47, a neutral vessel carrying members of the armed forces of the\r\nenemy while pursuing her ordinary course, may be stopped for the purpose\r\nof taking off such enemy persons and making them prisoners of war (see\r\nbelow, § 413).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Transmission of Intelligence to the Enemy.]\r\n\r\n§ 409. Either belligerent may punish neutral merchantmen for\r\ntransmission of intelligence to the enemy.\r\n\r\nAccording to customary rules hitherto in force, either belligerent might\r\npunish neutral vessels for the carriage of political despatches from or\r\nto the enemy, and especially for such despatches as were in relation to\r\nthe war. But to this rule there were two exceptions. Firstly, on the\r\nground that neutrals have a right to demand that their intercourse with\r\neither belligerent be not suppressed: a neutral vessel might not,\r\ntherefore, be punished for carrying despatches from the enemy to neutral\r\nGovernments, and _vice versa_,[866] and, further, despatches from the\r\nenemy Government to its diplomatic agents and consuls abroad in neutral\r\nStates, and _vice versa_.[867] Secondly, on account of article 1 of\r\nConvention XI., by which postal correspondence is inviolable, except in\r\nthe case of violation of blockade, the correspondence destined for, or\r\nproceeding from, the blockaded port. However, the mere fact that a\r\nneutral vessel had political despatches to or from the enemy on board\r\ndid not by itself prove that she was carrying them _for and in the\r\nservice of the enemy_. Just as in the case of certain enemy persons on\r\nboard, so in the case of despatches, the vessel was only considered to\r\nbe carrying them in the service of the enemy if either she knew of their\r\ncharacter and had nevertheless taken them on board, or if she was\r\ndirectly hired for the purpose of carrying them. Thus, the American\r\nvessel _Rapid_,[868] which was captured in 1810 during the war between\r\nGreat Britain and the Netherlands, on her voyage from New York to\r\nTonningen, for having on board a despatch for a Cabinet Minister of the\r\nNetherlands hidden under a cover addressed to a merchant at Tonningen,\r\nwas released by the Prize Court. On the other hand, the _Atalanta_,[869]\r\nwhich carried despatches in a tea chest hidden in the trunk of a\r\nsupercargo, was condemned.[870]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 866: The _Caroline_ (1808), 6 C. Rob. 461.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 867: The _Madison_ (1810), Edwards, 224.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 868: Edwards, 228.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 869: 6 C. Rob. 440.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 870: British practice seems unsettled on the question as to\r\nwhether the vessel must know of the character of the despatch which she\r\nis carrying. In spite of the case of the _Rapid_, quoted above, Holland,\r\n_Prize Law_, § 100, maintains that ignorance of the master of the vessel\r\nis no excuse, and Phillimore, III. § 272, seems to be of the same\r\nopinion.]\r\n\r\nAccording to the Declaration of London the carriage of despatches for\r\nthe enemy may only be punished in case it falls under the category of\r\ntransmitting intelligence to the enemy on the part of a neutral vessel.\r\nTwo kinds of such transmission of intelligence must be distinguished:--\r\n\r\nFirstly, according to article 46, No. 4, a neutral vessel exclusively\r\nintended for the transmission of intelligence to the enemy acquires\r\nthereby enemy character; this will be considered with other cases of the\r\nsame kind below in § 410.\r\n\r\nSecondly, according to article 45, No. 1, a neutral vessel may be seized\r\nfor transmitting intelligence to the enemy if she is on a voyage\r\nspecially undertaken for such transmission, that is to say, if she has\r\nbeen turned from her ordinary course and has touched or is going to\r\ntouch at a port outside her ordinary course for the purpose of\r\ntransmitting intelligence to the enemy. A liner, therefore, transmitting\r\nintelligence to the enemy in the ordinary course of her voyage may not\r\nbe considered to be rendering unneutral service and may not be punished.\r\nHowever, self-preservation would in a case of necessity justify a\r\nbelligerent in temporarily detaining such a liner for the purpose of\r\npreventing the intelligence from reaching the enemy.[871]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 871: See below, § 413.]\r\n\r\nThe conception \"transmission of intelligence\" is not defined by the\r\nDeclaration of London. It certainly means not only oral transmission of\r\nintelligence, but also the transmission of despatches containing\r\nintelligence. The transmission of any political intelligence of value to\r\nthe enemy, whether or no the intelligence is in relation to the war,\r\nmust be considered unneutral service, the case excepted in which\r\nintelligence is transmitted from the enemy to neutral Governments, and\r\nvice versa, and, further, from the enemy Government to its diplomatic\r\nagents and consuls abroad in neutral States. And it must be emphasised\r\nthat, although a vessel may be seized and punished for unneutral\r\nservice, according to article 1 of Convention XI. of the Second Hague\r\nPeace Conference the postal correspondence of neutrals or belligerents,\r\nwhatever its character, found on board is inviolable.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Unneutral Service creating Enemy Character.]\r\n\r\n§ 410. In contradistinction to cases of unneutral service which are\r\nsimilar to carriage of contraband, the Declaration of London enumerates\r\nin article 46 four cases of such kinds of unneutral service as vest\r\nneutral vessels with enemy character.[872]\r\n\r\n(1) There is, firstly, the case of a neutral merchantman taking a direct\r\npart in the hostilities. This may occur in several ways, but such vessel\r\nin every case loses her neutral and acquires enemy character, just as a\r\nsubject of a neutral Power who enlists in the ranks of the enemy armed\r\nforces. But a distinction must be made between taking a direct part in\r\nthe hostilities, for instance rendering assistance to the enemy fleet\r\nduring battle, on the one hand, and, on the other, acts of a piratical\r\ncharacter. If a neutral merchantman--see above, §§ 85, 181, and\r\n254--without Letters of Marque during war and from hatred of one of the\r\nbelligerents, were to attack and sink merchantmen of such belligerent,\r\nshe would have to be considered, and could therefore be treated as, a\r\npirate.\r\n\r\n(2) There is, secondly, the case of a neutral vessel which sails under\r\nthe orders or the control of an agent placed on board by the enemy\r\nGovernment. The presence of such agent, and the fact that the vessel\r\nsails under his orders or control shows clearly that she is really for\r\nall practical purposes part and parcel of the enemy forces.\r\n\r\n(3) There is, thirdly, the case of a neutral vessel in the exclusive\r\nemployment of the enemy. This may occur in two different ways: either\r\nthe vessel may be rendering a specific service in the exclusive\r\nemployment of the enemy, as, for instance, did those German merchantmen\r\nduring the Russo-Japanese War which acted as colliers for the Russian\r\nfleet _en route_ for the Far East; or the vessel may be chartered by the\r\nenemy so that she is entirely at his disposal for any purpose he may\r\nchoose, whether such purpose is or is not connected with the war.[873]\r\n\r\n(4) There is, fourthly and lastly, the case of a neutral merchantman\r\nexclusively intended at the time either for the transport of enemy\r\ntroops or for the transmission of intelligence for the enemy. This case\r\nis different from the case--provided for by article 45, No. 1--of a\r\nvessel on a voyage specially undertaken with a view to the carriage of\r\nindividual members of the armed forces of the enemy. Whereas the latter\r\nis a case of unneutral service rendered by a vessel which turns from her\r\ncourse for the purpose of rendering specific service, the former is a\r\ncase in which the vessel is exclusively and for the time being\r\npermanently intended and devoted to the rendering of unneutral service.\r\nFor the time being she is, therefore, actually part and parcel of the\r\nenemy marine. For this reason she is considered to be rendering\r\nunneutral service, and to have lost her neutral character, even if, at\r\nthe moment an enemy cruiser searches her, she is engaged neither in the\r\ntransport of troops nor in the transmission of intelligence. The fact is\r\ndecisive that she is for the time being exclusively intended for such\r\nunneutral service, whether or no she is at every moment really engaged\r\nin rendering such service. And it makes no difference, whether the\r\nvessel is engaged by the enemy and paid for the transport of troops or\r\nthe transmission of intelligence, or whether she renders the\r\nservice[874] gratuitously.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 872: See above, § 89 (1), p. 113.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 873: Two cases of interest occurred in 1905, during the\r\nRusso-Japanese War. The _Industrie_, a German vessel, and the\r\n_Quang-nam_, a French vessel, were captured and condemned by the\r\nJapanese for being in the employ of Russia as reconnoitring vessels,\r\nalthough the former pretended to collect news in the service of the\r\nChefoo _Daily News_, and the latter pretended to be a cargo vessel\r\nplying between neutral ports. See Takahashi, pp. 732 and 735.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 874: As regards the meaning of the term transmission of\r\nintelligence, see above, § 409.]\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nCONSEQUENCES OF UNNEUTRAL SERVICE\r\n\r\n  See the literature quoted above at the commencement of § 407.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Capture for Unneutral Service.]\r\n\r\n§ 411. According to customary rules hitherto prevailing, as well as\r\naccording to the Declaration of London, a neutral vessel may be captured\r\nif visit or search establish the fact, or grave suspicion of the fact,\r\nthat she is rendering unneutral service to the enemy. And such capture\r\nmay take place anywhere throughout the range of the Open Sea and the\r\nterritorial maritime belt of either belligerent.\r\n\r\nStress must be laid on the fact that mail steamers are on principle not\r\nexempt from capture for unneutral service. Although, according to\r\narticle 1 of Convention XI., the postal correspondence of belligerents\r\nas well as of neutrals, whatever its official or private character,\r\nfound on board a vessel on the sea is inviolable,[875] and a vessel may\r\nnever, therefore, be considered to be rendering unneutral service by\r\ncarrying amongst her postal correspondence despatches containing\r\nintelligence for the enemy, a mail steamer is nevertheless--see article\r\n2 of Convention XI.--not exempt from the laws and customs of naval war\r\nrespecting neutral merchantmen. A mail boat is, therefore, quite as much\r\nas any other merchantman, exposed to capture for rendering unneutral\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 875: See above, §§ 191 and 319.]\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, capture is allowed only so long as the vessel is\r\n_in delicto_, that is during the time in which she is rendering the\r\nunneutral service concerned or immediately afterwards while she is being\r\nchased for having rendered unneutral service. A neutral vessel may not,\r\ntherefore, be captured after the completion of a voyage specially\r\nundertaken for the purpose of transporting members of the armed forces\r\nof the enemy, or of transmitting intelligence for the enemy, or after\r\nhaving disembarked the military detachment of the enemy and the persons\r\ndirectly assisting the operations of the enemy in the course of the\r\nvoyage whom she was transporting. And it must be specially emphasised\r\nthat even such neutral vessel as had acquired--see article 46 of the\r\nDeclaration of London--enemy character by rendering unneutral service,\r\nceases to be _in delicto_ after her unneutral service has come to an\r\nend. Thus, for instance, a neutral vessel which took a direct part in\r\nhostilities[876] may not afterwards be captured, nor may a vessel which\r\nhas disembarked the agent of the enemy Government under whose orders or\r\ncontrol she was navigating.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 876: Provided she did not--see above, § 410 (1)--commit acts\r\nof a piratical character; for such acts she may always be punished.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Penalty for Unneutral Service.]\r\n\r\n§ 412. According to the practice hitherto prevailing, a neutral vessel\r\ncaptured for carriage of persons or despatches in the service of the\r\nenemy could be confiscated. Moreover, according to British[877]\r\npractice, such part of the cargo as belonged to the owner of the vessel\r\nwas likewise confiscated.[878] And if the vessel was not found guilty of\r\ncarrying persons or despatches in the service of the enemy, and was not\r\ntherefore condemned, the Government of the captor could nevertheless\r\ndetain the persons as prisoners of war and confiscate the despatches,\r\nprovided the persons and despatches concerned were in any way of such a\r\ncharacter as to make a vessel, which was cognisant of this character,\r\nliable to punishment for transporting them for the enemy.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 877: The _Friendship_ (1807), 6 C. Rob. 420; the _Atalanta_\r\n(1808), 6 C. Rob. 440. See Holland, _Prize Law_, §§ 95 and 105.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 878: See, however, the _Hope_ (1808), 6 C. Rob. 463, note.]\r\n\r\nThe Declaration of London recognises these three rules. Articles 45 and\r\n46 declare any vessel rendering any kind of unneutral service to the\r\nenemy liable to confiscation, and likewise declare such part of the\r\ncargo as belongs to the owner of the confiscated vessel liable to\r\nconfiscation. And article 47 enacts that, although a neutral vessel may\r\nnot be condemned because there are no grounds for her capture, the\r\ncapturing State may nevertheless detain as prisoners of war any members\r\nof the armed forces of the enemy who were found on board the vessel. The\r\ncase of despatches found on board is not mentioned by article 47, but\r\nthere ought to be no doubt--see below, § 413--that the old customary\r\nrule that, although the vessel may not be condemned because there is no\r\nground for capture, any despatches for the enemy found on board may, in\r\nanalogy with article 47, be confiscated, provided such despatches are\r\nnot part of the postal correspondence carried on board.\r\n\r\nIt must be emphasised that the mere fact that a neutral vessel is\r\nrendering unneutral service, is not sufficient for her condemnation; for\r\nin addition _mens rea_ is required. Now as regards the four kinds of\r\nunneutral service which create enemy character, _mens rea_ is obviously\r\nalways in existence, and therefore always presumed to be present. For\r\nthis reason article 46, in contradistinction to article 45, does not\r\nmention anything concerning the knowledge by the vessel of the outbreak\r\nof hostilities. But as regards the other cases of unneutral service,\r\narticle 45 provides that the vessel may not be confiscated if the vessel\r\nis encountered at sea while unaware of the outbreak of hostilities, or\r\nif the master, after becoming aware of the outbreak of hostilities, has\r\nhad no opportunity of disembarking the passengers concerned. On the\r\nother hand, a vessel is deemed, according to article 45, to be aware of\r\nthe existence of a state of war if she left an enemy port subsequent to\r\nthe outbreak of hostilities, or a neutral port subsequent to the\r\nnotification of the outbreak of hostilities to the Power to which such\r\nport belongs, provided that such notification was made in sufficient\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Declaration of London metes out the same punishment for the\r\nseveral kinds of unneutral service which it enumerates, it nevertheless\r\nmakes a distinction, apart from the penalty, with regard to the\r\ntreatment of the vessels captured for rendering unneutral service.\r\n\r\nArticle 45 provides for a neutral vessel captured for having rendered\r\neither of the two kinds of unneutral service mentioned in this article a\r\ntreatment which is, in a general way, the same as that for a neutral\r\nvessel captured for the carriage of contraband. This means that the\r\nvessel does not lose her neutral character, and must under all\r\ncircumstances and conditions be taken before a Prize Court, unless--see\r\narticle 49 of the Declaration of London--the taking of her into a port\r\nof the capturing State would involve danger to the safety of the\r\ncapturing vessel or to the success of the military operations in which\r\nshe is engaged at the time. And an appeal from the national Prize Courts\r\nmay be brought to the International Prize Court.\r\n\r\nArticle 46, on the other hand, provides, apart from the penalty, a\r\ntreatment for a vessel captured for having rendered any of the four\r\nkinds of unneutral service enumerated in this article which, in a\r\ngeneral way, is the same as that for a captured enemy merchantman. This\r\nmeans that such vessel acquires enemy character. Accordingly (see above,\r\n§ 89) all enemy goods on the vessel may be seized, all goods on board\r\nwill be presumed to be enemy goods, and the owners of neutral goods on\r\nboard will have to prove the neutral character of their goods. Further,\r\nthe rules of articles 48 and 49 of the Declaration of London concerning\r\nthe destruction of neutral vessels do not apply. Again, no appeal may be\r\nbrought from the national Prize Courts to the International Prize Court\r\nby the owner of the ship except concerning the one question only,\r\nnamely, whether the act of which she is accused has the character of\r\nunneutral service.[879]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 879: The question as to whether, if the vessel has been\r\ndestroyed by the captor, the innocent owners of the neutral goods on\r\nboard may claim compensation, has to be decided in the same way as the\r\nquestion as to whether the owners of neutral goods on a destroyed enemy\r\nmerchantman have a claim to compensation; see above, § 194.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Seizure of Enemy Persons and Despatches without Seizure of\r\nVessel.]\r\n\r\n§ 413. According to the British[880] and American practice, as well as\r\nthat of some other States, which has hitherto prevailed, whenever a\r\nneutral vessel was stopped for carrying persons or despatches for the\r\nenemy, these could not be seized unless the vessel were seized at the\r\nsame time. The release, in 1861, during the American Civil War, of\r\nMessrs. Mason[881] and Slidell, who had been forcibly taken off the\r\n_Trent_, while the ship herself was allowed to continue her voyage, was\r\nbased, by the United States, on the fact that the seizure of these men\r\nwithout the seizure of the vessel was illegal. Since, according to the\r\nDeclaration of London, a neutral vessel rendering unneutral service of\r\nany kind is liable to be confiscated, it is evident that in such a case\r\nthe enemy persons and despatches concerned may not be taken off the\r\nvessel unless the vessel herself is seized and brought into a port of a\r\nPrize Court. However, article 47 provides that any member of the armed\r\nforces of the enemy found on board a neutral merchant vessel may be\r\ntaken off and made a prisoner of war, although there may be no ground\r\nfor the capture of the vessel. Therefore, if a vessel carries individual\r\nmembers of the armed forces of the enemy in the ordinary course of her\r\nvoyage,[882] or if she transports a military detachment of the enemy and\r\nthe like without being aware of the outbreak of hostilities, the members\r\nof the armed forces of the enemy on board may be seized, although the\r\nvessel herself may not be seized, as she is not rendering unneutral\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 880: See Holland, _Prize Law_, § 104.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 881: See above, § 408, p. 519, note 3.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 882: Accordingly, in January 1912, during the Turco-Italian\r\nWar, the Italian gunboat _Volturno_, after having overhauled, in the Red\r\nSea, the British steamer _Africa_ going from Hodeida to Aden, took off\r\nand made prisoners of war Colonel Riza Bey and eleven other Turkish\r\nofficers. Although the Declaration of London is not yet ratified by\r\nGreat Britain, she did not protest. The case of the _Manouba_ ought\r\nlikewise to be mentioned here. This French steamer, which plies between\r\nMarseilles and Tunis, was stopped on January 16, 1912, by an Italian\r\ncruiser in the Mediterranean, and twenty-nine Turkish passengers, who\r\nwere supposed to be Turkish officers on their way to the theatre of war,\r\nwere forcibly taken off and made prisoners. On the protest of France,\r\nthe captives were handed over to her in order to ascertain whether they\r\nwere members of the Turkish forces, and it was agreed between the\r\nparties that the case should be settled by an arbitral award of the\r\nPermanent Court of Arbitration at the Hague, Italy asserting that she\r\nhad only acted in accordance with article 47 of the Declaration of\r\nLondon.]\r\n\r\nThe Declaration of London does not mention the case of enemy despatches\r\nembodying intelligence found on board such a neutral vessel as may not\r\nherself be captured for such carriage. For instance, in the case of a\r\nmail steamer pursuing her ordinary course and carrying a despatch of the\r\nenemy not in her mail bags but separately, the vessel may not, according\r\nto article 45, be seized. In this, and similar cases, may despatches be\r\nseized without the seizure of the vessel? It has been pointed out above,\r\n§ 409, that, in a case of necessity, self-preservation would justify a\r\nbelligerent in temporarily detaining such a liner for the purpose of\r\npreventing the intelligence from reaching the enemy. This certainly fits\r\nthe case of a vessel transmitting oral intelligence. But if a vessel\r\ncarried despatches, the necessity of detaining her ceases through\r\nseizure of the despatches themselves. The question--see above, §\r\n412--as to whether in such cases the despatches may be seized without\r\nseizure of the vessel ought, therefore, in analogy with article 47 of\r\nthe Declaration of London, to be answered in the affirmative.\r\n\r\nQuite different from the case of seizure of such enemy persons and\r\ndespatches as a vessel cannot carry without exposing herself to\r\npunishment, is the case[883] where a vessel has such enemy persons and\r\ndespatches on board as she is allowed to carry, but whom a belligerent\r\nbelieves it to be necessary in the interest of self-preservation to\r\nseize. Since necessity in the interest of self-preservation is,\r\naccording to International Law, an excuse[884] for an illegal act, a\r\nbelligerent may seize such persons and despatches, provided that such\r\nseizure is not merely desirable, but absolutely necessary[885] in the\r\ninterest of self-preservation, as, for instance, in the case where an\r\nAmbassador of the enemy on board a neutral vessel is on the way to\r\nsubmit to a neutral a draft treaty of alliance injurious to the other\r\nbelligerent.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 883: See Hall, § 253; Rivier, II. p. 390.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 884: See above, vol.

Right of visitation[886] is the right of belligerents to visit\r\nand eventually search neutral merchantmen for the purpose of\r\nascertaining whether these vessels really belong to the merchant marine\r\nof neutrals, and, if this is found to be the case, whether they are\r\nattempting to break a blockade, or carry contraband, or render unneutral\r\nservice to the enemy. The right of visit and search was already\r\nmentioned in the _Consolato del Mare_, and although it has often[887]\r\nbeen contested, its _raison d'être_ is so obvious that it has long been\r\nuniversally recognised in practice. It is indeed the only means by which\r\nbelligerents are able to ascertain whether neutral merchantmen intend to\r\nbring assistance to the enemy and to render him unneutral services.[888]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 886: It must be borne in mind that this right of visitation is\r\nnot an independent right but is involved in the right of either\r\nbelligerent--see above, § 314--to punish neutral vessels breaking\r\nblockade, carrying contraband, and rendering unneutral service.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 887: See, for instance, Hübner, _De la saisie des bâtiments\r\nneutres_ (1759), I. p. 227.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 888: Attention should be drawn to the _Règlement international\r\ndes prises maritimes_, adopted at Heidelberg in 1887 by the Institute of\r\nInternational Law; §§ 1-29 regulate visit and search. See _Annuaire_,\r\nIX. (1888), p. 202.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Right of Visitation, by whom, when, and where exercised.]\r\n\r\n§ 415. The right of visit and search may be exercised by all\r\nwarships[889] of belligerents. But since it is a belligerent right, it\r\nmay, of course, only be exercised after the outbreak and before the end\r\nof war. The right of visitation on the part of men-of-war of all nations\r\nin time of peace in a case of suspicion of piracy--see above, vol. I. §\r\n266 (2)--has nothing to do with the right of visit and search on the\r\npart of belligerents. And since an armistice does not bring war to an\r\nend, and since, on the other hand, the exercise of the right of\r\nvisitation is not an act of warfare, this right may be exercised during\r\nthe time of a partial as well as of a general armistice.[890] The region\r\nwhere the right may be exercised is the maritime territorial belt of\r\neither belligerent, and, further, the Open Sea, but not the maritime\r\nterritorial belt of neutrals. Whether the part of the Open Sea in which\r\na belligerent man-of-war meets with a neutral merchantman is near or far\r\naway from that part of the world where hostilities are actually taking\r\nplace makes no difference so long as there is suspicion against the\r\nvessel. The question as to whether the men-of-war of a belligerent may\r\nexercise the right of visitation in the maritime territorial belt of an\r\nally is one between the latter and the belligerent exclusively, provided\r\nsuch an ally is already a belligerent.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 889: It should be mentioned that privateers could also\r\nexercise the right of visit and search. But since even such States as\r\nhave not acceded to the Declaration of Paris in practice no longer issue\r\nLetters of Marque, such a case will no longer occur.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 890: But this is not universally recognised. Thus,\r\nHautefeuille, III. p. 91, maintains that during a general armistice the\r\nright of visitation may not be exercised, and § 5 of the _Règlement\r\ninternational des prises maritimes_ of the Institute of International\r\nLaw takes up the same attitude. It ought, likewise, to be mentioned that\r\nin strict law the right of visit and search may be exercised even after\r\nthe conclusion of peace before the treaty of peace is ratified. But the\r\nabove-mentioned § 5 of the _Règlement international des prises\r\nmaritimes_ declares this right to cease \"avec les préliminaires de la\r\npaix.\" See below, § 436.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Only Private Vessels may be Visited.]\r\n\r\n§ 416. During the nineteenth century it became universally recognised\r\nthat neutral men-of-war are not objects of the right of visit and search\r\nof belligerents.[891] And the same is valid regarding public neutral\r\nvessels which sail in the service of armed forces, such as transport\r\nvessels, for instance. Doubt exists as to the position of public neutral\r\nvessels which do not sail in the service of armed forces, but sail for\r\nother purposes, as, for instance, mail-boats belonging to a neutral\r\nState. It is asserted[892] that, if commanded by an officer of the Navy,\r\nthey must be treated in the same way as men-of-war, but that it is\r\ndesirable to ask the commanders to give their word of honour assuring\r\nthe absence of contraband and unneutral service.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 891: In former times Great Britain tried to extend visitation\r\nto neutral men-of-war. See Manning, p. 455.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 892: See, for instance, Gessner, p. 297, and Perels, § 52,\r\nIV.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Vessels under Convoy.]\r\n\r\n§ 417. Sweden in 1653, during war between Great Britain and the\r\nNetherlands, claimed that the belligerents ought to waive their right of\r\nvisitation over Swedish merchantmen if the latter sailed under the\r\nconvoy of a Swedish man-of-war whose commander asserted the absence of\r\ncontraband on board the convoyed vessels. The Peace of Westminster in\r\n1654 brought this war to an end, and in 1756 the Netherlands, then\r\nneutral, claimed the right of convoy. But it was not until the last\r\nquarter of the eighteenth century that the right of convoy was more and\r\nmore insisted upon by Continental neutrals. During the American War of\r\nIndependence in 1780, the Netherlands again claimed that right, and when\r\nthey themselves in 1781 waged war against Great Britain, they ordered\r\ntheir men-of-war and privateers to respect the right of convoy. Between\r\n1780 and 1800 treaties were concluded, in which Russia, Austria,\r\nPrussia, Denmark, Sweden, France, the United States of America, and\r\nother States recognised that right. But Great Britain always refused to\r\nrecognise it, and in July 1800 the action of a British squadron in\r\ncapturing a Danish man-of-war and her convoy of six merchantmen for\r\nresistance to visitation called the Second Armed Neutrality into\r\nexistence. Yet Great Britain still resisted, and by article 4 of the\r\n\"Maritime Convention\" of St. Petersburg of June 17, 1801, she conceded\r\nto Russia only that vessels under convoy should not be visited by\r\nprivateers. During the nineteenth century more and more treaties\r\nstipulating the right of convoy were concluded, but this right was not\r\nmentioned in the Declaration of Paris of 1856, and Great Britain refused\r\nto recognise it throughout the century. However, Great Britain abandoned\r\nher opposition at the Naval Conference of London of 1908-9, and the\r\nDeclaration of London proposes to settle the matter by articles 61 and\r\n62 in the following way:--\r\n\r\nNeutral vessels under the convoy of a man-of-war flying the same flag\r\nare exempt from search and may not be visited if the commander of the\r\nconvoy, at the request of the commander of the belligerent cruiser which\r\ndesires to visit, gives, in writing, all information as to the character\r\nof the convoyed vessels and their cargoes which could be obtained by\r\nsearch. Should the commander of the belligerent man-of-war have reason\r\nto suspect that the confidence of the commander of the convoy has been\r\nabused, he may not himself resort to visit and search, but must\r\ncommunicate with the commander of the convoy. The latter must\r\ninvestigate the matter, and must record the result of his investigation\r\nin a report, a copy of which must be given to the commander of the\r\nbelligerent cruiser. Should, in the opinion of the commander of the\r\nconvoy, the facts stated in the report justify the capture of one or\r\nmore of the convoyed vessels, he must withdraw protection from the\r\noffending vessels, and the belligerent cruiser may then capture them.\r\n\r\nIn case a difference of opinion arises between the commander of the\r\nconvoy and the commander of the belligerent cruiser--for instance, with\r\nregard to the question as to whether certain goods are absolute or\r\nconditional contraband or as to whether the port of destination of a\r\nconvoyed vessel is an ordinary commercial port or a port which serves as\r\na base of supply for the armed forces of the enemy and the like--the\r\ncommander of the belligerent cruiser has no power of overruling the\r\ndecision of the commander of the convoy. He can only protest and report\r\nthe case to his Government, which will settle the matter by means of\r\ndiplomacy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: No Universal Rules regarding Mode of Visitation.]\r\n\r\n§ 418. There are no rules of International Law which lay down all the\r\ndetails of the formalities of the mode of visitation. A great many\r\ntreaties regulate them as between the parties, and all maritime nations\r\nhave given instructions to their men-of-war regarding these formalities.\r\nThereby uniform formalities are practised with regard to many points,\r\nbut regarding others the practice of the several States differs. Article\r\n17 of the Peace Treaty of the Pyrenees of 1659 has served as a model of\r\nmany of the above-mentioned treaties regulating the formalities of\r\nvisitation: \"Les navires d'Espagne, pour éviter tout désordre,\r\nn'approcheront pas de plus près les Français que la portée du canon, et\r\npourront envoyer leur petite barque ou chaloupe à bord des navires\r\nfrançais et faire entrer dedans deux ou trois hommes seulement, à qui\r\nseront montrés les passeports par le maître du navire français, par\r\nlesquels il puisse apparoir, non seulement de la charge, mais aussi du\r\nlieu de sa demeure et résidence, et du nom tant du maître ou patron que\r\ndu navire même, afin que, par ces deux moyens, on puisse connaître, s'il\r\nporte des marchandises de contrebande; et qu'il apparaisse suffisamment\r\ntant de la qualité du dit navire que de son maître ou patron; auxquelles\r\npasseports on devra donner entière foi et créance.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Stopping of Vessels for the Purpose of Visitation.]\r\n\r\n§ 419. A man-of-war which wishes to visit a neutral vessel must stop her\r\nor make her bring to. Although the chasing of vessels may take place\r\nunder false colours, the right colours must be shown when vessels are\r\nstopped.[893] The order for stopping can be given[894] by hailing or by\r\nfiring one or two blank cartridges from the so-called affirming gun,\r\nand, if necessary, by firing a shot across the bows of the vessel. If\r\nnevertheless the vessel does not bring to, the man-of-war is justified\r\nin using force to compel her to bring to. Once the vessel has been\r\nbrought to, the man-of-war also brings to, keeping a reasonable\r\ndistance. With regard to this distance, treaties very often stipulate\r\neither the range of a cannon shot or half such width or even a range\r\nbeyond a cannon shot; but all this is totally impracticable.[895] The\r\ndistance must vary according to the requirements of the case, and\r\naccording to wind and weather.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 893: See above, § 211.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 894: See above, vol. I. § 268.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 895: See Ortolan, II. p. 220, and Perels, § 53, pp. 284, 285.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Visit.]\r\n\r\n§ 420. The vessel, having been stopped or brought to, is visited[896] by\r\none or two officers sent in a boat from the man-of-war. These officers\r\nexamine the papers of the vessel to ascertain her nationality, the\r\ncharacter of her cargo and passengers, and, lastly, the ports from and\r\nto which she is sailing. Instead of visiting the merchantman and\r\ninspecting her papers on board, the practice is followed, by the\r\nmen-of-war of some States, of summoning the master of the merchantman\r\nwith his papers on board the former and examining the papers there.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 896: See above, vol. I. § 268, and Holland, _Prize Law_, §§\r\n195-216.]\r\n\r\nIf everything is found in order and there is no suspicion of fraud, the\r\nvessel is allowed to continue her course, a memorandum of the visit\r\nhaving been entered in her log-book. On the other hand, if the\r\ninspection of the papers shows that the vessel is carrying contraband or\r\nrendering unneutral service, or that she is for another reason liable to\r\ncapture, she is at once seized. But it may be that, although ostensibly\r\neverything is in order, there is nevertheless grave suspicion of fraud\r\nagainst the vessel. In such case she may be searched.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Search.]\r\n\r\n§ 421. Search is effected[897] by one or two officers, and eventually a\r\nfew men, in presence of the master of the vessel. Care must be taken not\r\nto damage the vessel or the cargo, and no force whatever must be\r\napplied. No lock must be forcibly broken open by the search party, but\r\nthe master is to be required to unlock it. If he fails to comply with\r\nthe demand he is not to be forced thereto, since the master's refusal to\r\nassist the search in general, or that of a locked part of the vessel or\r\nof a locked box in particular, is at once sufficient cause for seizing\r\nthe vessel. Search being completed, everything removed has to be\r\nreplaced with care. If the search has satisfied the searching officers\r\nand dispelled all suspicion, a memorandum is entered in the log-book of\r\nthe vessel, and she is allowed to continue her voyage. On the other\r\nhand, if search brought contraband or another cause for capture to\r\nlight, the vessel is seized. But since search can never take place so\r\nthoroughly on the sea as in a harbour, it may be that, although search\r\nhas disclosed no proof to bear out the suspicion, grave suspicion still\r\nremains. In such case she may be seized and brought into a port for the\r\npurpose of being searched there as thoroughly as possible. But the\r\ncommander of a man-of-war seizing a vessel in such case must bear in\r\nmind that full indemnities must be paid to the vessel for loss of time\r\nand other losses sustained if finally she is found innocent. Therefore,\r\nafter a search at sea has brought nothing to light against the vessel,\r\nseizure should take place only in case of grave suspicion.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 897: See above, vol. I. § 269, and Holland, _Prize Law_, §§\r\n217-230.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Consequences of Resistance to Visitation.]\r\n\r\n§ 422. If a neutral merchantman resists visit or search, she is at once\r\ncaptured, and may be confiscated. The question as to whether the vessel\r\nonly, or also her cargo, could be confiscated for resistance has\r\nhitherto been controversial. According to British[898] and American\r\ntheory and practice, the cargo as well as the vessel was liable to\r\nconfiscation. But Continental[899] writers emphatically argued against\r\nthis and maintained that the vessel only was liable to confiscation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 898: The _Maria_ (1799), 1 C. Rob. 340.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 899: See Gessner, pp. 318-321.]\r\n\r\nAccording to article 63 of the Declaration of London, resistance to the\r\nlegitimate exercise of the right of visit, search, and capture involves\r\nin all cases the confiscation of the vessel, which by her forcible\r\nresistance has acquired enemy character (see above, § 89). For this\r\nreason such goods on board as belong to the master or owner of the\r\nvessel are treated as enemy goods and may be confiscated. Enemy goods on\r\nboard may now likewise be confiscated, although when they were first\r\nshipped the vessel bore neutral character. Further, all goods on board\r\nare now presumed to be enemy goods, and the owners of neutral goods on\r\nboard will have to prove the neutral character of their goods. Lastly,\r\nno appeal may be brought from the National Prize Courts to the\r\nInternational Prize Court by the owner of the ship except concerning the\r\none question only, namely, as to whether there was justification for\r\ncapturing her on the grounds of forcible resistance.\r\n\r\nIt must be emphasised that visit and search do not take place after a\r\nvessel has been captured for resistance, for the mere fact of resisting\r\nhas imposed enemy character upon her, and the question is now irrelevant\r\nwhether visit and search would show her to be guilty or innocent.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: What constitutes Resistance.]\r\n\r\n§ 423. According to the practice hitherto prevailing,[900] and also\r\naccording to the Declaration of London, a mere attempt on the part of a\r\nneutral merchantman to escape visitation does not in itself constitute\r\nresistance. Such vessel may be chased and compelled by force to bring\r\nto, and she cannot complain if, in the endeavour forcibly to compel her\r\nto bring to, she is damaged or accidentally sunk. If, after the vessel\r\nhas been compelled to bring to, visit and search show her to be\r\ninnocent, she must be allowed to proceed on her course.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 900: The _Maria_ (1799), 1 C. Rob. 340.]\r\n\r\nResistance to be penal must be _forcible_ resistance. It constitutes\r\nresistance, therefore, if a vessel applies force in resisting any\r\nlegitimate action by the belligerent cruiser which requires her to stop\r\nand to be visited and searched. The term _forcible resistance_ is not\r\ndefined in detail by article 63 of the Declaration of London. It is,\r\nconsequently, not certain whether the actual application of force only,\r\nor also the refusal, on the part of the master, to show the ship papers\r\nor to open locked parts of the vessel or locked boxes, and similar acts,\r\nconstitutes forcible resistance. The International Prize Court, if\r\nestablished, would have to develop a practice which would decide these\r\npoints.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sailing under Enemy Convoy equivalent to Resistance.]\r\n\r\n§ 424. Wheaton excepted, all writers would seem to agree that the fact\r\nof neutral merchantmen sailing under a convoy of enemy men-of-war is\r\nequivalent to forcible resistance on their part, whether they themselves\r\nintend to resist by force or not. But the Government of the United\r\nStates of America in 1810 contested this principle. In that year, during\r\nwar between Great Britain and Denmark, many American vessels sailing\r\nfrom Russia used to seek protection under the convoy of British\r\nmen-of-war, whereupon Denmark declared all such American vessels to be\r\ngood and lawful prizes. Several were captured without making any\r\nresistance whatever, and were condemned by Danish Prize Courts. The\r\nUnited States protested, and claimed indemnities from Denmark, and in\r\n1830 a treaty between the parties was signed at Copenhagen,[901]\r\naccording to which Denmark had to pay 650,000 dollars as indemnity. But\r\nin article 5 of this treaty the parties \"expressly declare that the\r\npresent convention is only applicable to the cases therein mentioned,\r\nand, having no other object, may never hereafter be invoked by one party\r\nor the other as a precedent or a rule for the future.\"[902]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 901: Martens, _N.R._ VIII. p. 350.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 902: See Wheaton, §§ 530-537, and Taylor, § 693, p. 790.\r\nWheaton was the negotiator of this treaty on the part of the United\r\nStates.--With the case of neutral merchantmen sailing under enemy\r\nconvoy, the other case--see above, § 185--in which neutral goods are\r\nplaced on board an armed enemy vessel is frequently confused. In the\r\ncase of the _Fanny_ (1814), 1 Dodson, 443, Sir William Scott condemned\r\nneutral Portuguese property on the ground that placing neutral property\r\non board an armed vessel was equal to resistance against visitation. But\r\nthe Supreme Court of the United States of America, in the of the\r\n_Nereide_ (1815), 9 Cranch, 388, held the contrary view. The Court was\r\ncomposed of four judges, of whom Story was one, and the latter dissented\r\nfrom the majority and considered the British practice correct. See\r\nPhillimore, III. § 341, and Wheaton, § 529.]\r\n\r\nArticle 63 of the Declaration of London does not--as was pointed out\r\nabove in § 423--define the term forcible resistance, but it is to be\r\nexpected that the practice of the International Prize Court would\r\nconsider the sailing under enemy convoy equivalent to forcible\r\nresistance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Resistance by Neutral Convoy.]\r\n\r\n§ 425. Since Great Britain did not, before agreeing to the Declaration\r\nof London, recognise the right of convoy and had always insisted upon\r\nthe right of visitation to be exercised over neutral merchantmen sailing\r\nunder the convoy of neutral men-of-war, the question has arisen as to\r\nwhether such merchantmen are considered resisting visitation in case the\r\nconvoying men-of-war only, and not the convoyed vessels themselves,\r\noffer resistance. British practice has answered the question in the\r\naffirmative. The rule was laid down in 1799[903] and in 1804[904] by Sir\r\nWilliam Scott in the cases of Swedish vessels captured while sailing\r\nunder the convoy of a Swedish man-of-war.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 903: The _Maria_, 1 C. Rob. 340.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 904: The _Elsebe_, 5 C Rob. 173.]\r\n\r\nSince Great Britain--see above, § 417--has abandoned her opposition to\r\nthe right of convoy and has agreed to articles 61 and 62 of the\r\nDeclaration of London which lay down rules concerning the matter, the\r\nresistance by a neutral convoy to visitation may not, under ordinary\r\ncircumstances, be considered to be resistance on the part of the\r\nconvoyed neutral merchantman. If, however, the commander of a convoy,\r\nafter having refused to give the written information mentioned in\r\narticle 61 or to allow the investigation mentioned in article 62,\r\nforcibly resists visitation of the convoyed merchantmen by a belligerent\r\ncruiser, the question as to whether resistance by a convoy is equivalent\r\nto resistance by a convoyed vessel, may even under the Declaration of\r\nLondon arise.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Deficiency of Papers.]\r\n\r\n§ 426. Since the purpose of visit is to ascertain the nationality of a\r\nvessel, the character of her cargo and passengers, and the ports from\r\nand to which she is sailing, it is obvious that this purpose cannot be\r\nrealised in case the visited vessel is deficient in her papers. As\r\nstated above in Vol. I. § 262, every merchantman ought to carry the\r\nfollowing papers: (1) A certificate of registry or a sea-letter\r\n(passport); (2) the muster-roll; (3) the log-book; (4) the manifest of\r\ncargo; (5) bills of lading, and (6) if chartered, the charter-party.\r\nNow, if a vessel is visited and cannot produce one or more of the papers\r\nmentioned, she is suspect. Search is, of course, admissible for the\r\npurpose of verifying the suspicion, but it may be that, although search\r\nhas not produced any proof of guilt, the suspicion is not dispelled. In\r\nsuch case she may be seized and brought to a port for thorough\r\nexamination. But, with the exception of the case that she cannot produce\r\neither certificate of registry or a sea-letter (passport), she ought not\r\nto be confiscated for deficiency in papers only. Yet, if the cargo is\r\nalso suspect, or if there are other circumstances which increase the\r\nsuspicion, confiscation would be, I believe, in the discretion of the\r\nPrize Court.\r\n\r\nThe Declaration of London does not mention the point, and the\r\nInternational Prize Court would, therefore, have to evolve a system of\r\nrules to be applied in cases concerned.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Spoliation, Defacement, and Concealment of Papers.]\r\n\r\n§ 427. Mere deficiency of papers does not arouse the same suspicion\r\nwhich a vessel incurs if she destroys[905] or throws overboard any of\r\nher papers, defaces them or conceals them, and in especial in case the\r\nspoliation of papers takes place at the time when the visiting vessel\r\ncomes in sight. Whatever her cargo may be, a vessel may at once be\r\nseized without further search so soon as it becomes apparent that\r\nspoliation, defacement, or concealment of papers has taken place. The\r\npractice of the several States has hitherto differed with regard to\r\nother consequences of spoliation, and the like, of papers, but\r\nconfiscation is certainly admissible in case other circumstances\r\nincrease the suspicion.[906]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 905: The _Hunter_ (1815), 1 Dodson, 480.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 906: See the case of the _Apollo_ in Calvo, V. § 2989.]\r\n\r\nThe Declaration of London does not mention the case of spoliation of\r\npapers, and it would therefore be the task of the International Prize\r\nCourt to evolve a uniform practice concerning the subject.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Double and False Papers.]\r\n\r\n§ 428. The highest suspicion is aroused through the fact that a visited\r\nvessel carries double papers, or false[907] papers, and such vessel may\r\ncertainly be seized. But the practice of the several States has hitherto\r\ndiffered with regard to the question whether confiscation is admissible\r\nfor the mere fact of carrying double or false papers. Whereas the\r\npractice of some States, as Russia and Spain, answered the question in\r\nthe affirmative, British[908] and American[909] practice took a more\r\nlenient view, and condemned such vessels only on a clear inference that\r\nthe false or double papers were carried for the purpose of deceiving the\r\nbelligerent by whom the capture was made, but not in other cases.[910]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 907: The _Sarah_ (1801), 3 C.

From the statements given above in §§ 368-428 regarding blockade,\r\ncontraband, unneutral service, and visitation, it is obvious that\r\ncapture may take place either because the vessel, or the cargo, or both,\r\nare liable to confiscation, or because grave suspicion demands a further\r\ninquiry which can be carried out in a port only. Both cases are alike so\r\nfar as all details of capture are concerned, and in the latter case\r\nPrize Courts may pronounce capture to be justified, although no ground\r\nfor confiscation of either vessel or cargo, or both, has been detected.\r\n\r\nThe mode of capture is the same as described above in § 184 regarding\r\ncapture of enemy vessels.[911]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 911: The _Règlement international des prises maritimes_,\r\nadopted by the Institute of International Law at its meeting at\r\nHeidelberg in 1887, regulates capture in §§ 45-62; see _Annuaire_, IX.\r\n(1888), p. 204.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effect of Capture of Neutral Vessels, and their Conduct to\r\nPort.]\r\n\r\n§ 430. The effect of capture of neutral vessels is in every way\r\ndifferent from the effect of capture of enemy vessels,[912] since the\r\npurpose of capture differs in these two cases. Capture of enemy vessels\r\nis made for the purpose of appropriating them in the exercise of the\r\nright of belligerents to appropriate all enemy property found on the\r\nOpen Sea or in the maritime territorial belt of either belligerent. On\r\nthe other hand, neutral merchantmen are captured for the purpose of\r\nconfiscation of vessel or cargo, or both, as punishment for certain\r\nspecial acts, the punishment to be pronounced by a Prize Court after a\r\nthorough investigation into all the circumstances of the special case.\r\nTherefore, although the effect of capture of neutral vessels is that the\r\nvessels, the individuals, and the goods thereon are placed under the\r\ncaptor's authority, her officers and crew never become prisoners of war.\r\nThey are indeed to be detained as witnesses for the trial of the vessel\r\nand cargo, but nothing stands in the way of releasing such of them as\r\nare not wanted for that purpose. As regards passengers, if any, they\r\nhave to be released as soon as possible, with the exception of those\r\nenemy persons who may be made prisoners of war.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 912: See above, § 185.]\r\n\r\nRegarding the conduct of captured neutral vessels to a port of a Prize\r\nCourt, the same is valid as regards conduct of captured enemy\r\nvessels[913] to such port.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 913: See above, § 193.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Destruction of Neutral Prizes.]\r\n\r\n§ 431. That as a rule captured neutral vessels may not be sunk, burned,\r\nor otherwise destroyed has always been universally recognised just as\r\nthat captured enemy merchantmen may not as a rule be destroyed. But up\r\nto the time of the agreement on the Declaration of London it was a moot\r\nquestion whether the destruction of captured neutral vessels was\r\nlikewise exceptionally allowed instead of bringing them before a Prize\r\nCourt. British[914] practice did not, as regards the neutral owner of\r\nthe vessel, hold the captor justified in destroying a vessel, however\r\nexceptional the case may have been, and however meritorious the\r\ndestruction of the vessel may have been from the point of view of the\r\nGovernment of the captor. For this reason, should a captor, for any\r\nmotive whatever, have destroyed a neutral prize, full indemnities had to\r\nbe paid to the owner, although, if brought into a port of a Prize Court,\r\ncondemnation of vessel and cargo would have been pronounced beyond\r\ndoubt. The rule was, that a neutral prize must be abandoned in case it\r\ncould not, for any reason whatever, be brought to a port of a Prize\r\nCourt. But the practice of other States did not recognise this British\r\nrule. The question became of great importance in 1905, during the\r\nRusso-Japanese War, when Russian cruisers sank the British vessels\r\n_Knight Commander_, _Oldhamia_, _Icona_, _St. Kilda_, and _Hipsang_, the\r\nGerman vessels _Thea_, and _Tetardos_, and the Danish vessel _Princesse\r\nMarie_. Russia paid damages to the owners of the vessels _Icona_, _St.\r\nKilda_, _Thea_, _Tetardos_, and _Princesse Marie_, because her Prize\r\nCourts declared that the capture of these vessels was not justified, but\r\nshe refused to pay damages to the owners of the other vessels destroyed,\r\nbecause her Prize Courts considered them to have been justly captured.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 914: The _Actaeon_ (1815), 2 Dodson, 48; the _Felicity_\r\n(1819), 2 Dodson, 381; the _Leucade_ (1855), Spinks, 217. See\r\nPhillimore, III. § 333; Twiss, II. § 166; Hall, § 77; Holland, _Letters\r\nto the \"Times\" upon War and Neutrality_ (1909), pp. 140-150.]\r\n\r\nThe Declaration of London proposes to settle the matter by a compromise.\r\nRecognising that neutral prizes may not as a rule be destroyed, and\r\nadmitting only one exception to the rule, it empowers the captor under\r\ncertain circumstances and conditions to demand the handing over, or to\r\nproceed himself to the destruction, of contraband carried by a neutral\r\nprize which he is compelled to abandon.\r\n\r\nThe very first rule of Chapter IV. of the Declaration of London, headed\r\n\"Destruction of Neutral Prizes,\" is that of article 48, according to\r\nwhich, as a matter of principle, captured neutral vessels may not be\r\ndestroyed, but must be taken into a port of a Prize Court. However,\r\narticle 49 permits, as an exception to the rule, the destruction of such\r\na captured neutral vessel as would herself be liable to condemnation, if\r\nthe taking of the vessel into a port of a Prize Court would involve\r\ndanger to the safety of the capturing cruiser, or to the success of the\r\noperations in which she is at the time of capture engaged.\r\n\r\nThere is, therefore, no doubt that a neutral prize may no longer be\r\ndestroyed because the captor cannot spare a prize crew or because a port\r\nof a Prize Court is too far distant, or the like. The only justification\r\nfor destruction of a neutral prize is danger to the captor or his\r\noperations at the time of capture. As regards the degree of danger\r\nrequired, it cannot be denied that the wording of article 49 does not\r\nprovide any clue for a restrictive interpretation. But considering that\r\narticle 51 speaks of an \"exceptional necessity,\" it is hoped and to be\r\nexpected that the International Prize Court would give such an\r\ninterpretation to article 49 as would permit a resort to the sinking of\r\nneutral prizes in cases of absolute necessity only. Be that as it may,\r\naccording to article 49 only such neutral prizes may be sunk as would be\r\nliable to confiscation if brought before a Prize Court. Sinking of\r\ncaptured neutral vessels--apart from neutral vessels which have acquired\r\nenemy character and may for this reason be sunk under the same\r\nconditions as enemy vessels--is, therefore, chiefly admitted in\r\nthree[915] cases, namely: (1) When--see article 40 of the Declaration of\r\nLondon--the vessel carries contraband the value of which forms more\r\nthan half the value of the cargo; (2) when a vessel has been captured\r\nfor rendering those kinds of unneutral service which are enumerated by\r\narticle 45 of the Declaration of London; (3) when--see article 21 of the\r\nDeclaration of London--a vessel has been captured for breach of\r\nblockade. In no case, however, in which she is not liable to\r\nconfiscation, may a neutral vessel under any circumstances and\r\nconditions be destroyed; she must always be abandoned if the capturing\r\ncruiser cannot take her into a port of a Prize Court.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 915: Only such cases of possible confiscation of a neutral\r\nvessel are mentioned in the text as are in accordance with the\r\nDeclaration of London. The practice of some States has hitherto admitted\r\nconfiscation in other cases also, for instance, in case of deficiency,\r\nspoliation, or defacement of ship papers, and in case of double and\r\nfalse papers; see above, §§ 426-428. It will be the task of the\r\nInternational Prize Court to evolve a uniform practice with regard to\r\nsuch cases. Likewise the text does not enumerate the cases in which the\r\nsinking of a neutral vessel is permissible because she previously\r\nacquired enemy character; concerning this, see above, § 89.]\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, when the captor feels compelled to resort to the\r\ndestruction of a neutral prize, he must place in safety all persons\r\nfound on the captured vessel, and he must take on board all the captured\r\nship's papers which are relevant for the purpose of deciding the\r\nvalidity of the capture (article 50). And (article 51) if the captor\r\nfails to establish the fact before the Prize Court that he destroyed the\r\nprize in the face of an exceptional necessity, the owners of the vessel\r\nand cargo must receive full compensation without any examination of, and\r\nany regard to, the question as to whether or no the capture itself was\r\njustifiable. Compensation must likewise be paid in case the capture is\r\nheld by the Prize Court to be invalid, although the act of destruction\r\nhas been held to be justifiable (article 52). And in any case, the\r\nowners of neutral goods not liable to condemnation which have been\r\ndestroyed with the vessel, may always and under all circumstances and\r\nconditions claim damages (article 53).\r\n\r\nThus many safeguards have been established against arbitrariness in\r\nresorting to the destruction of neutral prizes. On the other hand, it\r\nwould seem to be going too far to insist on the captor letting the prize\r\ngo with her contraband on board, if he be compelled to abandon the\r\nprize. For this reason article 54 empowers the captor of a neutral\r\nvessel herself not liable to confiscation, to demand the handing over,\r\nor to proceed himself to the destruction, of any goods liable to\r\nconfiscation found on board, if the taking of the vessel into a port of\r\na Prize Court would involve danger to the captor or to the success of\r\nthe operations in which he is at the time of capture engaged. Details\r\nconcerning such destruction have been given above in § 406_a_ (2).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ransom and Recapture of Neutral Prizes.]\r\n\r\n§ 432. Regarding ransom of captured neutral vessels, the same is valid\r\nas regards ransom of captured enemy vessels.[916]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 916: See above, § 195.]\r\n\r\nAs regards recapture of neutral prizes,[917] the rule ought to be that\r\n_ipso facto_ by recapture the vessel becomes free without payment of any\r\nsalvage. Although captured, she was still the property of her neutral\r\nowners, and if condemnation had taken place at all, it would have been a\r\npunishment, and the recapturing belligerent has no interest whatever in\r\nthe punishment of a neutral vessel by the enemy.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 917: See Hautefeuille, III. pp. 366-406; Gessner, pp. 344-356;\r\nKleen, II. § 217; Geffcken in Holtzendorff, IV. pp. 778-780; Calvo, V.\r\n§§ 3210-3216.]\r\n\r\nBut the matter of recapture of neutral prizes is not settled, no rule of\r\nInternational Law and no uniform practice of the several States being\r\nformulated regarding it. Very few treaties touch upon it, and the\r\nmunicipal regulations of the different States regarding prizes seldom\r\nmention it. According to British practice,[918] the recaptor of a\r\nneutral prize is entitled to salvage, in case the recaptured vessel\r\nwould have been liable to condemnation if brought into an enemy port.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 918: The _War Onskan_ (1799), 2 C. Rob. 299. See Holland,\r\n_Prize Law_, § 270.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Release after Capture.]\r\n\r\n§ 433. Besides the case in which captured vessels must be abandoned,\r\nbecause they cannot for some reason or another be brought into a port,\r\nthere are cases in which they are released without a trial. The rule is\r\nthat a captured neutral vessel is to be tried by a Prize Court in case\r\nthe captor asserts her to be suspicious or guilty. But it may happen\r\nthat all suspicion is dispelled even before the trial, and then the\r\nvessel is to be released at once. For this reason article 246 of\r\nHolland's _Prize Law_ lays down the rule: \"If, after the detention of\r\nthe vessel, there should come to the knowledge of the commander any\r\nfurther acts tending to show that the vessel has been improperly\r\ndetained, he should immediately release her....\" Even after she has been\r\nbrought into the port of a Prize Court, release can take place without a\r\ntrial. Thus the German vessels _Bundesrath_ and _Herzog_, which were\r\ncaptured in 1900 during the South African War and taken to Durban, were,\r\nafter search had dispelled all suspicion, released without trial.\r\n\r\nThat the released vessel may claim damages is a matter of course, and\r\narticle 64 of the Declaration of London precisely enacts it. But it\r\nshould be mentioned that, since Convention XII. stipulates only appeals\r\nagainst judgments of National Prize Courts, the International Prize\r\nCourt would not have jurisdiction in a case of the release of a vessel\r\nwithout trial, and that the question of compensation could, therefore,\r\nbe settled through the diplomatic channel only.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTRIAL OF CAPTURED NEUTRAL VESSELS\r\n\r\n  Lawrence, §§ 188-190--Maine, p. 96--Manning, pp.\r\n  472-483--Phillimore, III. §§ 433-508--Twiss, II. §§\r\n  169-170--Halleck, II. pp. 393-429--Taylor, §§ 563-567--Wharton,\r\n  III. §§ 328-330--Moore, VII. §§ 1222-1248--Wheaton, §§\r\n  389-397--Bluntschli, §§ 841-862--Heffter, §§ 172-173--Geffcken in\r\n  Holtzendorff, IV. pp. 781-788--Ullmann, § 196--Bonfils, Nos.\r\n  1676-1691--Despagnet, Nos. 677-682 _bis_--Rivier, II. pp.\r\n  353-356--Nys, III. pp. 710-718--Calvo, V. §§ 3035-3087--Fiore,\r\n  III.

Although belligerents have, under certain circumstances,\r\naccording to International Law, the right to capture neutral vessels,\r\nand although they have the duty to bring these vessels for trial before\r\na Prize Court, such trials are in no way an international matter. Just\r\nas Prize Courts--apart from the proposed International Prize Court--are\r\nmunicipal[919] institutions, so trials of captured neutral vessels by\r\nthese Prize Courts are municipal matters. The neutral home States of the\r\nvessels are not represented and, directly at any rate, not concerned in\r\nthe trial. Nor is, as commonly maintained, the law administered by Prize\r\nCourts International Law. These Courts apply the law of their country.\r\nThe best proof of this is the fact that the practice of the Prize Courts\r\nof the several countries has hitherto differed in many points. Thus, for\r\ninstance, the question what is and what is not contraband, and,\r\nfurther, the question when an attempt to break blockade begins and when\r\nit ends, have hitherto been differently answered by the practice of\r\ndifferent States.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 919: See above, § 192. The matter is regulated so far as Great\r\nBritain is concerned by the Naval Prize Act, 1864 (27 and 28 Vict. ch.\r\n25) and the Prize Courts Act, 1894 (57 and 58 Vict. ch. 39). The\r\n_Règlement international des prises maritimes_, adopted in 1887 at\r\nHeidelberg by the Institute of International Law, provides in §§ 63-118\r\ndetailed rules concerning the organisation of Prize Courts and the\r\nprocedure before them; see _Annuaire_, IX. (1888), p. 208.]\r\n\r\nMany writers, however, maintain that Prize Courts are International\r\nCourts, and that the law administered by these courts is International\r\nLaw. Lord Stowell again and again[920] emphatically asserted it, and the\r\nvast majority of English and American writers[921] follow him. But it is\r\nto be expected that the recognition of the difference between Municipal\r\nand International Law, as expounded above, Vol. I., §§ 20-25, and of the\r\nfact that States only, and neither their Courts nor officials nor\r\ncitizens, are subjects of International Law, will lead to the general\r\nrecognition of the fact that the law applied by National Prize Courts is\r\nnot and cannot be International Law.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 920: The _Maria_ (1799), 1 C. Rob. 340; the _Recovery_ (1807),\r\n6 C.

On the other\r\nhand, Holland, _Studies_, p. 199; Westlake, II. p. 289; and Scott,\r\n_Conferences_, p. 467, distinctly agree with me.]\r\n\r\nAnd matters will remain as they are even after the establishment of the\r\nInternational Prize Court and ratification of the Declaration of London.\r\nThe law of this Declaration is certainly International Law, but it will\r\nbe binding only upon the States, and they, on their part, must embody it\r\nin their Municipal Law so that their Prize Courts are obliged to\r\nadminister such a law in prize cases as is in conformity with the\r\nDeclaration of London. It will be the task of the International Prize\r\nCourt[922] to control the National Prize Courts in that direction. A\r\nState which is a party to the Declaration and would nevertheless order\r\nits Prize Courts to apply a law which is in opposition to the\r\nDeclaration of London, would commit an international delinquency, but\r\nits Prize Courts would be obliged to apply such law.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 922: Trial before this Court is, of course, an international\r\nmatter.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Result of Trial.]\r\n\r\n§ 435. The trial of a captured neutral ship can have one or more of five\r\nresults:--vessel and cargo can be condemned,[923] or the vessel alone,\r\nor the cargo alone; and the vessel and cargo can be released either with\r\nor without costs and damages. Costs and damages must be allowed when\r\ncapture was not justified, and, after the ratification of the\r\nDeclaration of London and the establishment of the International Prize\r\nCourt, an appeal may, according to article 64 of the Declaration of\r\nLondon and article 4 of Convention XII., be brought before the\r\nInternational Prize Court if costs and damages are refused or\r\ninadequately allowed by a Prize Court. But it must be emphasised that\r\ncapture might be justified, as, for instance, in the case of spoliation\r\nof papers, although the Prize Court did not condemn the vessel, and,\r\nfurther, that costs and damages are never allowed in case a part only of\r\nthe cargo is condemned, although the vessel herself and the greater part\r\nof the cargo are released. That, in case the captor is unable to pay the\r\ncosts and damages allowed to a released neutral vessel, his Government\r\nhas to indemnify the vessel, there ought to be no doubt, for a State\r\nbears \"vicarious\" responsibility[924] for internationally injurious acts\r\nof its naval forces.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 923: It would seem to be obvious that condemnation of the\r\nvessel involves the loss of the vessel at the date of capture; see\r\n_Andersen_ v. _Marten_, L.R. (1907) 2 K.B. 248.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 924: See above, vol. I. § 163.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Trial after Conclusion of Peace.]\r\n\r\n§ 436. It is a moot question whether neutral vessels captured before\r\nconclusion of peace may be tried after the conclusion of peace.[925] I\r\nthink that the answer must be in the affirmative, even if a special\r\nclause is contained in the Treaty of Peace, which stipulates that\r\ncaptured but not yet condemned vessels of the belligerents shall be\r\nreleased. A trial of neutral prizes is in any case necessary for the\r\npurpose of deciding the question whether capture was justified or not,\r\nand whether, should condemnation not be justified, the neutral vessels\r\nmay claim costs and indemnities. Thus, after the conclusion of the\r\nAbyssinian War, in December 1896, the Italian Prize Commission, in the\r\ncase of the _Doelwijk_,[926] claimed the right to try the vessel in\r\nspite of the fact that peace had been concluded between the time of\r\ncapture and trial, declared the capture of the vessel and cargo to have\r\nbeen justified, but pronounced that, peace having been concluded,\r\nconfiscation of vessel and cargo would no longer be lawful.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 925: See Perels, § 57, p. 309, in contradistinction to\r\nBluntschli, § 862. But there is, of course, no doubt that a belligerent\r\ncan exercise an act of grace and release such prizes. Thus, in November\r\n1905, at the end of the Russo-Japanese War, the Mikado proclaimed the\r\nunconditional release of all neutral prizes captured after the signing\r\nbut before the ratification of the Peace of Portsmouth. Thereby, three\r\nGerman vessels, two English, and one Norwegian escaped confiscation,\r\nwhich in strict law--see above, p. 534, note 4--would have been\r\njustified.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 926: See Martens, _N.R.G._ 2nd Ser. XXVIII. pp. 66-90.]\r\n\r\nDifferent from the question whether neutral prizes may be tried after\r\nthe conclusion of peace is the other question whether they may be\r\ncondemned to be confiscated. In the above-mentioned case of the\r\n_Doelwijk_ the question was answered in the negative, but I believe it\r\nought to have been answered in the affirmative. Confiscation of vessel\r\nand cargo having the character of a punishment, it would seem that the\r\npunishment may be inflicted after the conclusion of peace provided the\r\ncriminal act concerned was consummated before peace was concluded. But\r\nnothing, of course, stands in the way of a belligerent taking a more\r\nlenient view and ordering his Prize Courts not to pronounce confiscation\r\nof neutral vessels after the conclusion of peace.\r\n\r\nThe Declaration of London does not settle either the former or the\r\nlatter question, and it would therefore be the task of the\r\nInternational Prize Court to evolve a uniform practice in the cases\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Protests and Claims of Neutrals after Trial.]\r\n\r\n§ 437. Hitherto, if a trial led to condemnation, and if the latter was\r\nconfirmed by the Court of Appeal, the matter as between the captor and\r\nthe owner of the captured vessel and cargo was finally settled. But the\r\nright of protection,[927] which a State exercises over its subjects and\r\ntheir property abroad, may nevertheless have been the cause of\r\ndiplomatic protests and claims on the part of the neutral home State of\r\na condemned vessel or cargo, in case the verdict of the Prize Courts was\r\nconsidered to be not in accordance with International Law or formally or\r\nmaterially unjust. It is through such protests and claims that the\r\nmatter, which was hitherto a mere municipal one, became of\r\n_international_ importance. And history records many instances of cases\r\nof interposition of neutral States after trials of vessels which had\r\nsailed under their flags. Thus, for instance, in the famous case of the\r\nSilesian Loan,[928] it was the fact that Frederick II. of Prussia\r\nconsidered the procedure of British Prize Courts regarding a number of\r\nPrussian merchantmen captured during war between Great Britain and\r\nFrance in 1747 and 1748 as unjust, which made him in 1752 resort to\r\nreprisal and cease the payment of the interest of the Silesian Loan. The\r\nmatter was settled[929] in 1756, through the payment of £20,000 as\r\nindemnity by Great Britain. Thus, further, after the American Civil War,\r\narticles 12-17 of the Treaty of Washington[930] provided the appointment\r\nof three Commissioners for the purpose, amongst others, of deciding all\r\nclaims against verdicts of the American Prize Courts. And when in 1879,\r\nduring war between Peru and Chili, the German vessel _Luxor_ was\r\ncondemned by the Peruvian Courts, Germany interposed and the vessel was\r\nreleased.[931]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 927: See above, vol.

Numerous inconveniences must naturally result from a condition of\r\nInternational Law which has hitherto prevailed and according to which\r\nthe Courts of the belligerent whose forces had captured neutral vessels\r\nexercised jurisdiction without any control by neutrals. Although, as\r\nshown above in § 437, neutrals frequently interfered after a trial and\r\nsucceeded in obtaining recognition for their claims in face of the\r\nverdicts of Prize Courts, great dissatisfaction has long been felt at\r\nthe condition of matters hitherto obtaining, and proposals have been\r\nmade for so-called mixed Prize Courts.\r\n\r\nThe first proposal of this kind was made in 1759 by Hübner,[932] who\r\nsuggested a Prize Court composed of judges nominated by the belligerent\r\nand of consuls or councillors nominated by the home State of the\r\ncaptured neutral merchantmen.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 932: _De la saisie des bâtiments neutres_ (1759), vol. II. p.\r\n21.]\r\n\r\nA somewhat similar proposal was made by Tetens[933] in 1805.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 933: _Considérations sur les droits réciproques des puissances\r\nbelligérantes et des puissances neutres sur mer, avec les principes du\r\ndroit de guerre en général_ (1805), p. 163.]\r\n\r\nOther proposals followed until the Institute of International Law took\r\nup the matter in 1875, appointing, on the suggestion of Westlake, at its\r\nmeeting at the Hague, a Commission for the purpose of drafting a _Projet\r\nd'organisation d'un tribunal international des prises maritimes_. In the\r\ncourse of time there were mainly two proposals before the Institute,\r\nWestlake's and Bulmerincq's.\r\n\r\nWestlake proposed[934] that Courts of Appeal should be instituted in\r\neach case of war, and each Court should consist of three judges--one to\r\nbe nominated by the belligerent concerned, another by the home State of\r\nthe neutral prizes concerned, and the third by a neutral Power not\r\ninterested in the case. According to Westlake's proposal there would\r\ntherefore have to be instituted in every war as many Courts of Appeal as\r\nneutrals concerned.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 934: See _Annuaire_, II. (1878), p. 114.]\r\n\r\nBulmerincq proposed[935] that two Courts should be instituted in each\r\nwar for all prize cases, the one to act as Prize Court of the First\r\nInstance, the other to act as Prize Court of Appeal; each Court to\r\nconsist of three judges, one judge to be appointed by each belligerent,\r\nthe third judge to be appointed in common by all neutral maritime\r\nPowers.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 935: See _R.I._ XI. (1879), pp. 191-194.]\r\n\r\nFinally, the Institute agreed, at its meeting at Heidelberg in 1887,\r\nupon the following proposal, which is embodied in §§ 100-109 of the\r\n_Règlement international des prises maritimes_:[936]--At the beginning\r\nof a war each belligerent institutes a Court of Appeal consisting of\r\nfive judges, the president and one of the other judges to be appointed\r\nby the belligerent, the three remaining to be nominated by three neutral\r\nPowers, and this Court to be competent for all prize cases.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 936: _Annuaire_, IX. (1887), p. 239.]\r\n\r\nNo further step was taken in the matter during the nineteenth century.\r\nBut, during the South African War, the conviction became general that\r\nthe exclusive jurisdiction of belligerents over captured neutral vessels\r\nis incompatible with the modern condition of the oversea commerce of\r\nneutrals. At the Second Peace Conference of 1907, therefore, Germany, as\r\nwell as Great Britain, brought forward a project for real International\r\nPrize Courts.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: German Project of 1907.]\r\n\r\n§ 439. The German project[937] was embodied in a draft of thirty-one\r\narticles dealing in three chapters with \"Competence in Prize Cases,\"\r\n\"Organisation of the International Prize Court,\" and \"Procedure\r\nbefore the International Prize Court,\" and made the following\r\nproposals:--National Prize Courts should only be competent in the first\r\ninstance, every appeal to go to the International Prize Court, and the\r\nlatter to be competent not only in case of capture of neutral vessels,\r\nbut in every case of capture of merchantmen. At the beginning of every\r\nwar an International Prize Court should be established, but, in case\r\nthere were more than two parties to a war, as many International Prize\r\nCourts should be established as there were couples of States fighting\r\nagainst each other. Each Court every time it sat should consist of five\r\njudges, three of whom should be members of the Permanent Court of\r\nArbitration at the Hague, and two should be admirals. The admirals\r\nshould belong to the navies of the belligerents, but the three members\r\nof the Permanent Court of Arbitration should be chosen by neutral\r\nPowers, each belligerent authorising one neutral Power to select one\r\nmember, and these two neutrals to appoint a third neutral Power which\r\nwould select the third member. The Court should sit at the Hague, have\r\nits first meeting when the first appeal case arose, and be dissolved\r\nafter the conclusion of peace. The International Bureau of the Permanent\r\nCourt of Arbitration should serve as the Registry of every International\r\nPrize Court. Each belligerent and the owners of the captured vessels or\r\ncargoes should have the right to bring an appeal before the\r\nInternational Prize Court.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 937: _Deuxième Conférence, Actes_, II. p. 1071.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: British Project of 1907.]\r\n\r\n§ 440. The British project[938] was embodied in a draft of sixteen\r\narticles, and made the following proposals:--The International Prize\r\nCourt should be competent in such cases only as directly concerned a\r\nneutral Power or its subjects, an appeal to be brought before the\r\nInternational Court only after the case had been decided by the highest\r\nNational Prize Court of the belligerent concerned. Neutral Powers only,\r\nand not their subjects, should have the right to enter an appeal, and\r\neach neutral Power should represent its subjects concerned in a prize\r\ncase. In contradistinction to the German project, the British draft\r\nproposed the establishment once for all of a Permanent International\r\nPrize Court, each Power whose mercantile marine at the date of the\r\nsignature of the proposed convention exceeded a total of 800,000 tons,\r\nshould, within three months from the date of ratification, nominate a\r\nprominent jurist as a member of the Court, and another as his deputy.\r\nThe President of the Court should be nominated by the signatory Powers\r\nin their alphabetical order, should remain in office one year only, and\r\nshould have a casting vote. If a legal question were to be decided which\r\nhad already been provided for in a convention between the parties in\r\ndispute, the Court should base its decision on such convention. In the\r\nabsence of such a convention, and if all civilised nations were agreed\r\non a point of legal interest, the Court should base its decision\r\nthereon, otherwise the Court should decide according to the principles\r\nof International Law.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 938: _Deuxième Conférence de la Paix, Actes_, II. p. 1076.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Convention XII. of the Second Peace Conference.]\r\n\r\n§ 441. The Second Peace Conference, after having studied and discussed\r\nthe German and the British projects, produced the \"Convention (XII.)\r\nrespecting the establishment of an International Prize Court\" which, on\r\nthe whole, follows more closely the lines of the British project, but\r\nincludes several features of the German, and others which originate\r\nneither with the British nor the German project. It comprises\r\nfifty-seven articles and is divided into four parts headed respectively\r\n\"General Provisions\" (articles 1-9), \"Constitution of the International\r\nPrize Court\" (articles 10-27), \"Procedure in the International Prize\r\nCourt\" (articles 28-50), and \"Final Provisions\" (articles 51-57). The\r\nConvention was signed by all the Powers represented at the Conference,\r\nexcept Brazil, China, Domingo, Greece, Luxemburg, Montenegro, Nicaragua,\r\nRoumania, Russia, Servia, and Venezuela. Ten States--namely, Chili,\r\nCuba, Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, Persia, Salvador, Siam, Turkey, and\r\nUruguay--entered a reservation against article 15 of the Convention\r\nbecause they did not agree with the principle of the composition of the\r\nCourt embodied in this article.\r\n\r\nAs eleven States did not sign the Convention and ten of the signatory\r\nStates refused to accept the composition of the Court as regulated by\r\narticle 15, it cannot be said that the Convention is based on universal\r\nagreement. Yet the fact that, with the exception of Russia, all the\r\nGreat Powers and a great number of the minor Powers have signed it\r\nwithout a reservation, offers sufficient guarantee for the success of\r\nthe Court when once established. Nothing prevents a future Peace\r\nConference from making such alterations in the Convention as would meet\r\nthe wishes of the Powers which at present refuse to sign the Convention\r\nor to accept article 15.\r\n\r\nIt should be mentioned that, according to article 55, the Convention\r\nremains in force for twelve years from the date it comes into force, and\r\nis to be tacitly renewed for six years, unless denounced one year at\r\nleast before the expiry of the period for which it is in force. And\r\narticle 57 stipulates that two years before the expiration of the period\r\nfor which it is in force, any contracting Power may demand a\r\nmodification of the provisions concerning its own participation in the\r\ncomposition of the Court. The demand must be addressed to the\r\nAdministrative Council which, on its part, must examine it and submit\r\nproposals as to the measures to be adopted to all the contracting\r\nPowers. These Powers must, with the least possible delay, inform the\r\nAdministrative Council of their decision. The result is at once, or at\r\nany rate one year and thirty days before the expiry of the period of two\r\nyears, to be communicated to the Power which made the demand for a\r\nmodification of the provisions concerning its participation in the\r\ncomposition of the Court.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nCONSTITUTION AND COMPETENCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL PRIZE COURT\r\n\r\n  Westlake, II. pp. 288-297--Lawrence, § 192--Ullmann, §\r\n  196--Bonfils, Nos. 1440'1-1440'3--Despagnet, Nos. 683-683\r\n  _bis_--Fiore, Code, Nos. 1897-1901--Dupuis, _Guerre_, Nos.\r\n  232-276--Bernsten, § 14--Lémonon, pp. 293-335--Higgins, pp.\r\n  435-444--Barclay, _Problems_, pp. 105-108--Scott, _Conferences_,\r\n  pp. 466-511--Nippold, I. §§ 16-19--Fried, _Die zweite Haager\r\n  Konferenz_ (1908), pp. 121-130--Lawrence, _International Problems_\r\n  (1908), pp. 132-159--Hirschmann, _Das internationale Prisenrecht_\r\n  (1912), §§ 39-41--Gregory, White, and Scott in _A.J._ II.

The International Prize Court consists of judges and deputy\r\njudges, a judge who is absent or prevented from sitting being replaced\r\nby a deputy (article 14). The judges and the deputies are appointed by\r\nthe contracting Powers from among jurists of known proficiency in\r\nmaritime International Law, and of the highest moral reputation, each\r\nPower appointing one judge and one deputy for a period of six years\r\n(articles 10 and 11). The judges are all of equal rank and have\r\nprecedence according to the date of the notification of their\r\nappointment to the Administrative Council of the Permanent Court of\r\nArbitration at the Hague, but, if they sit by rota in conformity with\r\narticle 15, paragraph 2, they have precedence according to the date on\r\nwhich they entered upon their duties, and, when the date is the same,\r\nthe senior takes precedence; deputies rank after the judges (article\r\n12). The judges--and the deputies when taking the places of\r\njudges--must, when outside their own country, be granted diplomatic\r\nprivileges and immunities in the performance of their duties; they must,\r\nbefore taking their seats, take an oath, or make a solemn affirmation,\r\nbefore the Administrative Council, that they will discharge their\r\nduties impartially and conscientiously (article 13). No judge or deputy\r\njudge may, during the tenure of his office, appear as agent or advocate\r\nbefore the International Prize Court, nor act for one of the parties in\r\nany capacity whatever (article 17).\r\n\r\nAttention should be drawn to the fact that the Court, if once\r\nestablished, will be permanent, and the judges, if once appointed, will\r\nalways be at hand, although in time of peace they will not sit.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Deciding Tribunal.]\r\n\r\n§ 443. The judges appointed by the contracting Powers do not, as a body,\r\ndecide the appeal cases brought before the Court. From among the great\r\nnumber of judges appointed, a deciding tribunal is formed which is\r\ncomposed of fifteen judges, nine of whom constitute a quorum; and a\r\njudge who is absent or prevented from sitting is replaced by a deputy\r\n(article 14). The judges appointed by Great Britain, Germany, the United\r\nStates of America, Austria-Hungary, France, Italy, Japan, and Russia are\r\nalways summoned to sit, but the judges appointed by the remaining\r\ncontracting Powers are only in rotation summoned to sit, and their\r\nduties may successively be performed by the same person, since the same\r\nindividual may be appointed as judge by several of these Powers (article\r\n15). If a belligerent Power has, according to the rota, no judge sitting\r\nin the deciding tribunal, it has a right to demand that the judge\r\nappointed by it shall take part in the settlement of all cases arising\r\nfrom the war, and lots shall then be drawn to decide which of the judges\r\nentitled to sit by rota shall withdraw, but the judge of the other\r\nbelligerent party does not take part in the drawing of lots (article\r\n16). No judge may sit who has been a party, in any way whatever, to the\r\nsentence pronounced by the National Prize Court against which the appeal\r\nhas been made, or who has taken part in the case as counsel or advocate\r\nfor one of the parties (article 17). The summoning by rota of the\r\njudges appointed by the minor Powers takes place according to the\r\nfollowing list:--\r\n\r\n         JUDGES      DEPUTY JUDGES\r\n\r\n              _First Year_\r\n\r\n      1.

The salaries\r\nand travelling expenses are to be paid by the International Bureau of\r\nthe Permanent Court of Arbitration, and the judges must not receive any\r\nother remuneration either from their own Government or from any other\r\nPower (article 20).\r\n\r\nThe belligerent captor, as well as a neutral Power which is herself, or\r\nwhose national is, a party, may appoint a naval officer of high rank to\r\nsit as _Assessor_, but he has no voice in the decision. If more than one\r\nneutral Power is concerned in a case, they must agree among themselves,\r\nif necessary by lot, on the naval officer to be appointed as Assessor\r\n(article 18).\r\n\r\nThe seat[939] of the deciding tribunal is at the Hague, and it may not,\r\nexcept in the case of _force majeure_, be transferred elsewhere without\r\nthe consent of both belligerents (article 21). When the Court is not\r\nsitting, the duties conferred on it by certain articles of Convention\r\nXII. are discharged by a delegation of three judges appointed by the\r\nCourt; this delegation comes to a decision by a majority of votes, and\r\nits members must, of course, reside at the Hague while they fulfil their\r\nduties (article 48).\r\n\r\n[Footnote 939: The working-order (_ordre intérieur_) of the\r\nInternational Prize Court is to be drawn up by the Court itself; see\r\ndetails in article 49.]\r\n\r\nThe deciding tribunal determines what language it will itself use and\r\nwhat languages may be used before it, but in all cases the official\r\nlanguage of the National Courts which have had cognisance of the case\r\nmay be used before it (article 24).\r\n\r\nFor all notices to be served, in particular on the parties, witnesses,\r\nor experts, the deciding tribunal may apply direct to the Government of\r\nthe State on whose territory the service is to be carried out. The same\r\nrule applies in the case of steps to be taken to procure evidence. The\r\nCourt is equally entitled to act through the Power on whose territory it\r\nholds its sitting. Notices to be given to parties in the place where\r\nthe Court sits may be served through the International Bureau (article\r\n27).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Administrative Council and International Bureau.]\r\n\r\n§ 444. The Administrative Council of the Permanent Court of Arbitration\r\nat the Hague serves at the same time as the Administrative Council of\r\nthe International Prize Court, but only representatives of the Powers\r\nwho are parties to Convention XII. shall be members of it (article 22).\r\n\r\nThe International Bureau of the Permanent Court of Arbitration acts as\r\nRegistry of the International Prize Court and must place its offices and\r\nstaff at the disposal of the Court. This Bureau has the custody of the\r\narchives and carries out the administrative work, and its General\r\nSecretary acts as Registrar of the International Prize Court. The\r\nsecretaries necessary to assist the Registrar, translators, and\r\nshorthand writers are appointed by the International Prize Court\r\n(article 23).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Agents, Counsel, Advocates, and Attorneys.]\r\n\r\n§ 445. Belligerent as well as neutral Powers concerned in a case may\r\nappoint special Agents to act as intermediaries between themselves and\r\nthe International Prize Court, and they may also engage Counsel or\r\nAdvocates to defend their rights and interests (article 25).\r\n\r\nPrivate individuals concerned in a case are compelled to be represented\r\nbefore the Court by an Attorney, who must either be an Advocate\r\nqualified to plead before a Court of Appeal or a High Court of one of\r\nthe contracting States, or a lawyer practising before a similar Court,\r\nor, lastly, a Professor of Law at one of the higher teaching centres of\r\nthose countries (article 26).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Competence.]\r\n\r\n§ 446. The general principle underlying the rules of Convention XII.\r\nconcerning the competence of the International Prize Court is that on\r\nthe whole, _although not exclusively_, the Court is competent in cases\r\nwhere neutrals are directly or indirectly concerned. The International\r\nPrize Court is, as a rule, a Court of Appeal, all prize cases must, in\r\nthe first instance, be decided by a National Prize Court of the captor,\r\nalthough the Municipal Law of the country concerned may provide that a\r\nfirst appeal must likewise be decided by a National Prize Court. The\r\nsecond appeal may never by decided by a National, but must always be\r\ndecided by the International Prize Court. However, should the National\r\nCourt of the First Instance or the National Court of Appeal fail to give\r\nfinal judgment within two years from the date of capture, the case may\r\nbe carried direct to the International Prize Court (articles 2 and 6).\r\n\r\nAn appeal against the judgments of National Prize Courts may be brought\r\nbefore the International Court: (1) when the judgment concerns the\r\nproperty of a neutral Power or a neutral individual;[940] (2) when the\r\njudgment concerns enemy property and relates to (_a_) cargo on board a\r\nneutral vessel, (_b_) an enemy vessel captured in the territorial waters\r\nof a neutral Power, provided such Power has not made the capture the\r\nsubject of diplomatic claim, and (_c_) a claim based upon the allegation\r\nthat the seizure has been effected in violation, either of the\r\nprovisions of a convention in force between the belligerent Powers, or\r\nof an enactment issued by the belligerent captor. In any case, the\r\nappeal may be based on the ground that the judgment was wrong either in\r\nfact or in law (article 3).\r\n\r\n[Footnote 940: Since the question of enemy or neutral character of\r\nindividuals--see above, § 88--is for some parts controversial, the\r\nInternational Prize Court would have to decide the controversy.]\r\n\r\nThe following Powers and individuals are entitled[941] to bring an\r\nappeal before the International Prize Court:--\r\n\r\n(1) Neutral Powers, if the judgment injuriously affects their property\r\nor the property of their subjects, or if the capture is alleged to have\r\ntaken place in the territorial waters of such Powers (article 4, No. 1).\r\n\r\n(2) Neutral individuals,[942] if the judgment injuriously affects their\r\nproperty. But the home State of such an individual may intervene and\r\neither forbid him to bring the appeal before the International Prize\r\nCourt, or itself undertake the proceedings in his place (article 4, No.\r\n2).\r\n\r\n(3) Subjects of the enemy, if the judgment injuriously affects their\r\ncargoes on neutral vessels, or if it injuriously affects their property\r\nin case the seizure is alleged to have been effected in violation,\r\neither of the provisions of a convention in force between the\r\nbelligerent Powers, or of an enactment issued by the belligerent captor\r\n(article 4, No. 3).\r\n\r\n(4) Subjects of neutral Powers or of the enemy deriving rights from the\r\nrights of such individuals as are themselves qualified to bring an\r\nappeal before the International Prize Court, provided they have\r\nintervened in the proceedings of the National Court or Courts concerned.\r\nIndividuals so entitled may appeal separately to the extent of their\r\ninterests (article 5, first paragraph).\r\n\r\n(5) Subjects of neutral Powers or of the enemy deriving rights from the\r\nrights of a neutral Power whose property was the subject of the\r\njudgment. Individuals so entitled may likewise appeal separately to the\r\nextent of their interest, provided they have intervened in the\r\nproceedings of the National Court or Courts concerned (article 5, second\r\nparagraph).\r\n\r\n[Footnote 941: But note article 51 of Convention XII.] [Footnote 942:\r\nSee above, vol. I. § 289, p. 365.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: What Law to be applied.]\r\n\r\n§ 447. As regards the law to be applied by the International Prize\r\nCourt, article 7 of Convention XII. contains the following provisions\r\nand distinctions:--\r\n\r\n(1) If a question of law to be decided be covered by a treaty in force\r\nbetween the belligerent captor and a Power which is itself, or whose\r\nsubject is, a party to the proceedings, the Court must apply the\r\nprovisions of such treaty.\r\n\r\n(2) In absence of such provisions, the Court must apply the rules of\r\nInternational Law.\r\n\r\n(3) If there be no generally recognised rules of International Law which\r\ncould be applied, the Court must base its decision on the general\r\nprinciples of justice and equity.\r\n\r\n(4) If--see article 3, No. 2 (_c_) of Convention XII.--the ground of\r\nappeal be the violation of an enactment issued by the belligerent\r\ncaptor, the Court must apply such enactment.\r\n\r\n(5) The Court is empowered to disregard failure, on the part of an\r\nappellant, to comply with the procedure laid down by the Municipal Law\r\nof the belligerent captor, if it is of opinion that the consequences of\r\nsuch Municipal Law are unjust or inequitable.\r\n\r\nThe very wide powers of the International Prize Court with regard to the\r\nlaw to be applied by it, have been considerably narrowed down by the\r\nfact that the Declaration of London provides a code of Prize Law, which\r\nin time will be universally accepted, but those powers are still very\r\nwide.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nPROCEDURE IN THE INTERNATIONAL PRIZE COURT\r\n\r\n  See the literature quoted above at the commencement of § 442.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Entering of Appeal.]\r\n\r\n§ 448. As a rule there are two ways of entering an appeal against the\r\njudgment of a National Prize Court, namely, either by a written\r\ndeclaration made in the National Court against whose judgment the\r\nappeal is directed, or by a written or telegraphic declaration\r\naddressed to the International Bureau. In either case the appeal must be\r\nentered within one hundred and twenty days from the day the judgment was\r\ndelivered or notified (article 28). But the appeal must be addressed to\r\nthe International Bureau only, if a party intends to carry a case direct\r\nto the International Prize Court on account of the National Courts\r\nhaving failed to give final judgment within two years from the date of\r\ncapture, and in such case the appeal must be entered within thirty days\r\nfrom the expiry of the period of two years (article 30).\r\n\r\nIf the appeal has been entered in the National Court, this Court must,\r\nwithout considering the question as to whether the appeal was entered in\r\ntime, transmit within seven days the record of the case to the\r\nInternational Bureau. On the other hand, if the declaration of appeal\r\nhas been sent to the International Bureau, this Bureau must immediately,\r\nif possible by telegraph, send information to the National Court\r\nconcerned which must within seven days transmit the record of the case\r\nto the Bureau. And should the appeal be entered by a neutral individual,\r\nthe International Bureau must immediately by telegraph inform the\r\nGovernment of the respective individual in order to enable such\r\nGovernment to come to a decision as to whether it will--see article 4,\r\nNo. 2--prevent the individual from going on with the appeal, or will\r\nundertake proceedings in his stead (article 29).\r\n\r\nIf the appeal has not been entered in time, the Court must reject it\r\nwithout discussion of the merits of the case. But the Court may grant\r\nrelief from the effect of this rule and admit the appeal, if the\r\nappellant is able to show that he was prevented by _force majeure_ from\r\nentering the appeal in time, and that he has entered the appeal within\r\nsixty days after the circumstances which prevented him from entering it\r\nearlier ceased to operate (article 31).\r\n\r\nIf the appeal has been entered in time, a certified copy of the notice\r\nof appeal must officially be transmitted to the respondent by the Court;\r\nif the Court is not sitting, its delegation of three judges must act for\r\nit (articles 32 and 48). If in addition to the parties who are before\r\nthe Court through an appeal having been entered, there are other parties\r\nconcerned who are entitled to appeal, or if in the case referred to in\r\narticle 29, third paragraph, the Government which has received notice of\r\nan appeal has not announced its decision, the Court may not deal with\r\nthe case until either the period of one hundred and twenty days from the\r\nday the judgment of the National Prize Court has been delivered or\r\nnotified, or the period of thirty days from the expiry of two years from\r\nthe date of capture has expired (article 31).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pleadings and Discussion.]\r\n\r\n§ 449. The procedure, which follows the entry of an appeal and the\r\npreliminary steps in consequence thereof, comprises two distinct phases,\r\nnamely, written pleadings and oral discussion.\r\n\r\n(1) The written _pleadings_ consist of the deposit and exchange of\r\ncases, counter-cases, and, if necessary, of replies, the order of which,\r\nas also the periods within which they must be delivered, must be fixed\r\nby the Court or its delegation of three judges (article 48), and to\r\nwhich all papers and documents the parties intend to make use of must be\r\nannexed. The Court must communicate a certified copy of every document\r\nproduced by one party to the other party (article 34).\r\n\r\n(2) After the close of the pleadings the Court must fix a day for a\r\npublic sitting on which the _discussion_ is to take place (article 35).\r\nThe discussion is under the direction of the President or\r\nVice-President, or, in case both of these are absent or cannot act, of\r\nthe senior judge present; but the judge appointed by a belligerent\r\nparty may never preside (article 38). The discussion takes place with\r\nopen doors, but a Government which is a party may demand that the\r\ndiscussion take place with closed doors. In any case minutes must be\r\ntaken and must be signed by the President and Registrar, and these\r\nminutes alone have an authentic character (article 39). During the\r\ndiscussion the parties state their views of the case both as to the law\r\nand as to the facts, but the Court may at any stage suspend the speeches\r\nof counsel in order that supplementary evidence may be obtained (article\r\n35). The Court may order the supplementary evidence to be taken, either\r\nin the manner provided for by article 27, or before itself, or before\r\none or more members of the Court provided it can be done without\r\ncompulsion or intimidation; if steps are taken by members of the Court\r\noutside the territory where it is sitting, the consent of the foreign\r\nGovernment must be obtained (article 36). The parties must be summoned\r\nto take part in all stages of the taking of supplementary evidence, and\r\nthey must receive certified copies of the minutes (article 37). If a\r\nparty does not appear in spite of having been duly summoned, or if a\r\nparty fails to comply with some step within the period fixed by the\r\nCourt, the case proceeds without that party and the Court makes its\r\ndecision on the basis of the material at its disposal, but the Court\r\nmust officially notify to the parties all decisions or orders made in\r\ntheir absence (article 40).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Judgment.]\r\n\r\n§ 450. After the discussion follows the judgment of the Court.\r\n\r\nThe deliberation of the Court in order to agree upon the judgment takes\r\nplace in private and must remain secret. The Court must take into\r\nconsideration all the documents, evidence, and oral statements. All\r\nquestions are decided by a majority of the judges present; if the number\r\nof the judges is even and is equally divided, the vote of the junior\r\njudge in the order of precedence is not counted (articles 42 and 43).\r\nThe judgment must be taken down in writing, state the reasons upon which\r\nit is based, give the names of the judges taking part in it and of the\r\nassessors, if any, and must be signed by the President and Registrar.\r\n\r\nThe pronouncement of the judgment of the Court takes place in public,\r\nthe parties being present or having been duly summoned to attend. The\r\njudgment must be officially communicated to the parties. After this\r\ncommunication has been made, the Court must transmit to the National\r\nPrize Court concerned the record of the case, together with copies of\r\nthe various decisions arrived at and of the minutes of the proceedings\r\n(article 45).\r\n\r\nIf the Court pronounces the capture of a vessel or cargo to be valid,\r\nthey may be disposed of in accordance with the Municipal Law of the\r\nbelligerent captor. If the Court pronounces the capture to be invalid,\r\nrestitution of the vessel or cargo must be ordered, and the amount of\r\ndamages, if any, must be fixed, especially in case the vessel or cargo\r\nhas been sold or destroyed. If the National Prize Court has already\r\ndeclared the capture to be invalid, the International Prize Court must\r\ndecide on an appeal concerning the damages due to the owner of the\r\ncaptured vessel or cargo (article 8).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Expenses and Costs.]\r\n\r\n§ 451. The _general expenses_ of the International Prize Court are borne\r\nby the contracting Powers in proportion to their share in the\r\ncomposition of the Court as laid down in article 15 of Convention XII.;\r\nthe appointment of deputy judges does not involve any contribution\r\n(article 47).\r\n\r\nAs regards _costs_, each party pays its own, but the party against whom\r\nthe Court has given its decision, must bear the costs of the trial and,\r\nin addition, must pay one per cent. of the value of the subject matter\r\nof the case as a contribution to the general expenses of the\r\nInternational Prize Court. The amount of the payments must be fixed in\r\nthe judgment of the Court (article 46, first and second paragraphs). If\r\nthe appeal is brought by an individual, he must, after having entered\r\nthe appeal, furnish the International Bureau with security to an amount\r\nfixed by the Court or--see article 48--by its delegation (article 46,\r\nthird paragraph).\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nACTION IN DAMAGES INSTEAD OF APPEAL\r\n\r\n  Scott in _A.J._ V. (1911), pp. 302-324.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reason for Action in Damages instead of Appeal.]\r\n\r\n§ 452. According to the Constitution of the United States of America,\r\nand probably that of some other States, no appeal may be brought against\r\na judgment of their Highest Courts. These States could not, therefore,\r\nratify Convention XII. and take part in the establishment of the\r\nInternational Prize Court without previously having altered their\r\nConstitution. As such alteration would be a very complicated and\r\nprecarious matter, the Naval Conference of London of 1908-9 included in\r\nthe Final Protocol of the Conference the following _voeu_:--\"The\r\nDelegates of the Powers represented at the Naval Conference and which\r\nhave signed or have expressed their intention to sign the Hague\r\nConvention of October 18, 1907, concerning the establishment of an\r\nInternational Prize Court, considering the constitutional difficulties\r\nwhich, in certain States, stand in the way of the ratification of that\r\nConvention in its actual form, agree to call the attention of their\r\nGovernments to the advantage of concluding an arrangement according to\r\nwhich the said States would, in depositing their ratifications, have the\r\npower to add thereto a reservation to the effect that the right of\r\nrecourse to the International Prize Court in connection with decisions\r\nof their National Courts, shall take the form of a direct action for\r\ndamages, provided, however, that the effect of this reservation shall\r\nnot be such as to impair the rights guaranteed by the said Convention to\r\nprivate individuals as well as to Governments, and that the terms of the\r\nreservation shall form the subject of a subsequent understanding between\r\nthe signatory Powers of the same Convention.\"\r\n\r\nTo carry out this recommendation, Great Britain, Germany, the United\r\nStates of America, Argentina, Austria-Hungary, Chili, Denmark, Spain,\r\nFrance, Japan, Norway, Holland, and Sweden signed on September 19, 1910,\r\nat the Hague the \"Additional Protocol to the Convention relative to the\r\nestablishment of an International Prize Court\" which comprises nine\r\narticles, is (article 8) considered to be an integral part of that\r\nConvention, and which will be ratified at the same time as the\r\nConvention, accession to the Convention being subordinated (article 9)\r\nto accession to the Protocol.[943]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 943: There is no doubt that, should the International Prize\r\nCourt be established, all the contracting Powers of Convention XII.\r\nwould accede to this additional protocol.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Procedure if Action for Damages is brought.]\r\n\r\n§ 453. According to article 1 of the Protocol, those signatory or\r\nacceding Powers of Convention XII. which are prevented by difficulties\r\nof a constitutional nature from accepting the Convention in its\r\nunaltered form, have, in ratifying the Convention or acceding to it, the\r\nright to declare that in prize cases over which their National Courts\r\nhave jurisdiction, recourse to the International Prize Court may only be\r\nhad in the form of an action in damages for the injury caused by the\r\ncapture. In consequence thereof the procedure in the International\r\nPrize Court, as described above, §§ 448-451, takes place with the\r\nfollowing modifications:--\r\n\r\n(1) The action for damages may only be brought before the International\r\nPrize Court by means of a written or telegraphic declaration addressed\r\nto the International Bureau (article 5). This Bureau must directly\r\nnotify, if possible by telegraph, the Government of the belligerent\r\ncaptor, which, without considering whether the prescribed periods of\r\ntime have been observed, must within seven days of the receipt of the\r\nnotification, transmit to the International Bureau the case and a\r\ncertified copy of the decision, if any, rendered by the National Prize\r\nCourt (article 6).\r\n\r\n(2) The International Prize Court does not, as in Appeal Cases,\r\npronounce upon the validity or nullity of the capture concerned, nor\r\nconfirm or reverse the judgment of the National Prize Court, but simply\r\nfixes the amount of damages to be allowed, if any, to the plaintiff, if\r\nthe capture is considered to be illegal (article 3).\r\n\r\n(3) After having delivered judgment, the International Prize Court does\r\nnot transmit the record of the case, the various decisions arrived at,\r\nand the minutes, to the National Prize Court, but directly to the\r\nGovernment of the belligerent captor (article 7).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDICES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX I\r\n\r\n      DECLARATION OF PARIS OF 1856\r\n\r\n\r\nLes Plénipotentiaires qui ont signé le Traité de Paris du trente mars,\r\nmil huit cent cinquante-six, réunis en Conférence,--\r\n\r\nConsidérant:\r\n\r\nQue le droit maritime, en temps de guerre, a été pendant longtemps\r\nl'objet de contestations regrettables;\r\n\r\nQue l'incertitude du droit et des devoirs en pareille matière, donne\r\nlieu, entre les neutres et les belligérants, à des divergences d'opinion\r\nqui peuvent faire naître des difficultés sérieuses et même des conflits;\r\n\r\nQu'il y a avantage, par conséquent, à établir une doctrine uniforme sur\r\nun point aussi important;\r\n\r\nQue les Plénipotentiaires assemblés au Congrès de Paris ne sauraient\r\nmieux répondre aux intentions, dont leurs Gouvernements sont animés,\r\nqu'en cherchant à introduire dans les rapports internationaux des\r\nprincipes fixes à cet égard;\r\n\r\nDûment autorisés, les susdits Plénipotentiaires sont convenus de se\r\nconcerter sur les moyens d'atteindre ce but; et étant tombés d'accord\r\nont arrêté la Déclaration solennelle ci-après:--\r\n\r\n1.

Déclaration relative à l'interdiction de lancer des projectiles et\r\ndes explosifs du haut de ballons.\r\n\r\nCes Conventions et cette Déclaration formeront autant d'actes séparés.\r\nCes actes porteront la date de ce jour et pourront être signés jusqu'au\r\n30 juin 1908 à La Haye par les Plénipotentiaires des Puissances\r\nreprésentées à la Deuxième Conférence de la Paix.\r\n\r\nLa Conférence, se conformant à l'esprit d'entente et de concessions\r\nréciproques qui est l'esprit même de ses délibérations, a arrêté la\r\ndéclaration suivante qui, tout en réservant à chacune des Puissances\r\nreprésentées le bénéfice de ses votes, leur permet à toutes d'affirmer\r\nles principes qu'Elles considèrent comme unanimement reconnus:\r\n\r\n  Elle est unanime,\r\n\r\n  1'o. A reconnaître le principe de l'arbitrage obligatoire;\r\n\r\n  2'o. A déclarer que certains différends, et notamment ceux\r\n  relatifs à l'interprétation et à l'application des stipulations\r\n  conventionnelles internationales, sont susceptibles d'être soumis\r\n  à l'arbitrage obligatoire sans aucune restriction.\r\n\r\nElle est unanime enfin à proclamer que, s'il n'a pas été donné de\r\nconclure dès maintenant une Convention en ce sens, les divergences\r\nd'opinion qui se sont manifestées n'ont pas dépassé les limites d'une\r\ncontroverse juridique, et qu'en travaillant ici ensemble pendant quatre\r\nmois, toutes les Puissances du monde, non seulement ont appris à se\r\ncomprendre et à se rapprocher davantage, mais ont su dégager, au cours\r\nde cette longue collaboration, un sentiment très élevé du bien commun de\r\nl'humanité.\r\n\r\nEn outre, la Conférence a adopté à l'unanimité la Résolution suivante:\r\n\r\nLa Deuxième Conférence de la Paix confirme la Résolution adoptée par la\r\nConférence de 1899 à l'égard de la limitation des charges militaires;\r\net, vu que les charges militaires se sont considérablement accrues dans\r\npresque tous les pays depuis ladite année, la Conférence déclare qu'il\r\nest hautement désirable de voir les Gouvernements reprendre l'étude\r\nsérieuse de cette question.\r\n\r\nElle a, de plus, émis les Voeux suivants:\r\n\r\n  1'o. La Conférence recommande aux Puissances signataires\r\n  l'adoption du projet ci-annexé de Convention pour l'établissement\r\n  d'une Cour de Justice arbitrale, et sa mise en vigueur dès qu'un\r\n  accord sera intervenu sur le choix des juges et la constitution de\r\n  la Cour.\r\n\r\n  2'o. La Conférence émet le voeu qu'en cas de guerre, les autorités\r\n  compétentes, civiles et militaires, se fassent un devoir tout\r\n  spécial d'assurer et de protéger le maintien des rapports\r\n  pacifiques et notamment des relations commerciales et\r\n  industrielles entre les populations des États belligérants et les\r\n  pays neutres.\r\n\r\n  3'o. La Conférence émet le voeu que les Puissances règlent, par\r\n  des Conventions particulières, la situation, au point de vue des\r\n  charges militaires, des étrangers établis sur leurs territoires.\r\n\r\n  4'o. La Conférence émet le voeu que l'élaboration d'un règlement\r\n  relatif aux lois et coutumes de la guerre maritime figure au\r\n  programme de la prochaine Conférence et que, dans tous les cas,\r\n  les Puissances appliquent, autant que possible, à la guerre sur\r\n  mer, les principes de la Convention relative aux lois et coutumes\r\n  de la guerre sur terre.\r\n\r\nEnfin, la Conférence recommande aux Puissances la réunion d'une\r\ntroisième Conférence de la Paix qui pourrait avoir lieu, dans une\r\npériode analogue à celle qui s'est écoulée depuis la précédente\r\nConférence, à une date à fixer d'un commun accord entre les Puissances,\r\net elle appelle leur attention sur la nécessité de préparer les travaux\r\nde cette troisième Conférence assez longtemps à l'avance pour que ses\r\ndélibérations se poursuivent avec l'autorité et la rapidité\r\nindispensables.\r\n\r\nPour atteindre à ce but, la Conférence estime qu'il serait très\r\ndésirable que environ deux ans avant l'époque probable de la réunion,\r\nun Comité préparatoire fût chargé par les Gouvernements de recueillir\r\nles diverses propositions à soumettre à la Conférence, de rechercher les\r\nmatières susceptibles d'un prochain règlement international et de\r\npréparer un programme que les Gouvernements arrêteraient assez tôt pour\r\nqu'il pût être sérieusement étudié dans chaque pays. Ce Comité serait,\r\nen outre, chargé, de proposer un mode d'organisation et de procédure\r\npour la Conférence elle-même.\r\n\r\nEn foi de quoi, les Plénipotentiaires ont signé le présent acte et y ont\r\napposé leurs cachets.\r\n\r\nFait à La Haye, le dix-huit octobre mil neuf cent sept, en un seul\r\nexemplaire qui sera déposé dans les archives du Gouvernement des\r\nPays-Bas et dont les copies, certifiées conformes, seront délivrées à\r\ntoutes les Puissances représentées à la Conférence.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONVENTION I.\r\n\r\n      CONVENTION FOR THE PACIFIC SETTLEMENT OF INTERNATIONAL\r\n      DISPUTES.[944]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 944: Only the texts of this and the other Conventions of the\r\nSecond Peace Conference are here printed; the preambles, reservations,\r\nand special declarations made in signing the Conventions are omitted.]\r\n\r\n_Titre I.--Du maintien de la paix générale._\r\n\r\nArticle premier.\r\n\r\nEn vue de prévenir autant que possible le recours à la force dans les\r\nrapports entre les États, les Puissances contractantes conviennent\r\nd'employer tous leurs efforts pour assurer le règlement pacifique des\r\ndifférends internationaux.\r\n\r\n_Titre II.--Des bons offices et de la médiation._\r\n\r\nArticle 2.\r\n\r\nEn cas de dissentiment grave ou de conflit, avant d'en appeler aux\r\narmes, les Puissances contractantes conviennent d'avoir recours, en tant\r\nque les circonstances le permettront, aux bons offices ou à la médiation\r\nd'une ou de plusieurs Puissances amies.\r\n\r\nArticle 3.\r\n\r\nIndépendamment de ce recours, les Puissances contractantes jugent utile\r\net désirable qu'une ou plusieurs Puissances étrangères au conflit\r\noffrent de leur propre initiative, en tant que les circonstances s'y\r\nprêtent, leurs bons offices ou leur médiation aux Etats en conflit.\r\n\r\nLe droit d'offrir les bons offices ou la médiation appartient aux\r\nPuissances étrangères au conflit, même pendant le cours des hostilités.\r\n\r\nL'exercice de ce droit ne peut jamais être considéré par l'une ou\r\nl'autre des Parties en litige comme un acte peu amical.\r\n\r\nArticle 4.\r\n\r\nLe rôle du médiateur consiste à concilier les prétentions opposées et à\r\napaiser les ressentiments qui peuvent s'être produits entre les États en\r\nconflit.\r\n\r\nArticle 5.\r\n\r\nLes fonctions du médiateur cessent du moment où il est constaté, soit\r\npar l'une des Parties en litige, soit par le médiateur lui-même, que les\r\nmoyens de conciliation proposés par lui ne sont pas acceptés.\r\n\r\nArticle 6.\r\n\r\nLes bons offices et la médiation, soit sur le recours des Parties en\r\nconflit, soit sur l'initiative des Puissances étrangères au conflit, ont\r\nexclusivement le caractère de conseil et n'ont jamais force obligatoire.\r\n\r\nArticle 7.\r\n\r\nL'acceptation de la médiation ne peut avoir pour effet, sauf convention\r\ncontraire, d'interrompre, de retarder ou d'entraver la mobilisation et\r\nautres mesures préparatoires à la guerre.\r\n\r\nSi elle intervient après l'ouverture des hostilités, elle n'interrompt\r\npas, sauf convention contraire, les opérations militaires en cours.\r\n\r\nArticle 8.\r\n\r\nLes Puissances contractantes sont d'accord pour recommander\r\nl'application, dans les circonstances qui le permettent, d'une médiation\r\nspéciale sous la forme suivante.\r\n\r\nEn cas de différend grave compromettant la paix, les États en conflit\r\nchoisissent respectivement une Puissance à laquelle ils confient la\r\nmission d'entrer en rapport direct avec la Puissance choisie d'autre\r\npart, à l'effet de prévenir la rupture des relations pacifiques.\r\n\r\nPendant la durée de ce mandat dont le terme, sauf stipulation contraire,\r\nne peut excéder trente jours, les États en litige cessent tout rapport\r\ndirect au sujet du conflit, lequel est considéré comme déféré\r\nexclusivement aux Puissances médiatrices. Celles-ci doivent appliquer\r\ntous leurs efforts à régler le différend.\r\n\r\nEn cas de rupture effective des relations pacifiques, ces Puissances\r\ndemeurent chargées de la mission commune de profiter de toute occasion\r\npour rétablir la paix.\r\n\r\n_Titre III.--Des Commissions internationales d'enquête._\r\n\r\nArticle 9.\r\n\r\nDans les litiges d'ordre international n'engageant ni l'honneur ni des\r\nintérêts essentiels et provenant d'une divergence d'appréciation sur des\r\npoints de fait, les Puissances contractantes jugent utile et désirable\r\nque les Parties qui n'auraient pu se mettre d'accord par les voies\r\ndiplomatiques instituent, en tant que les circonstances le permettront,\r\nune Commission internationale d'enquête chargée de faciliter la solution\r\nde ces litiges en éclaircissant, par un examen impartial et\r\nconsciencieux, les questions de fait.\r\n\r\nArticle 10.\r\n\r\nLes Commissions internationales d'enquête sont constituées par\r\nconvention spéciale entre les Parties en litige.\r\n\r\nLa convention d'enquête précise les faits à examiner; elle détermine le\r\nmode et le délai de formation de la Commission et l'étendue des pouvoirs\r\ndes commissaires.\r\n\r\nElle détermine également, s'il y a lieu, le siège de la Commission et la\r\nfaculté de se déplacer, la langue dont la Commission fera usage et\r\ncelles dont l'emploi sera autorisé devant elle, ainsi que la date à\r\nlaquelle chaque Partie devra déposer son exposé des faits, et\r\ngénéralement toutes les conditions dont les Parties sont convenues.\r\n\r\nSi les Parties jugent nécessaire de nommer des assesseurs, la convention\r\nd'enquête détermine le mode de leur désignation et l'étendue de leurs\r\npouvoirs.\r\n\r\nArticle 11.\r\n\r\nSi la convention d'enquête n'a pas désigné le siège de la Commission,\r\ncelle-ci siégera à La Haye.\r\n\r\nLe siège une fois fixé ne peut être changé par la Commission qu'avec\r\nl'assentiment des Parties.\r\n\r\nSi la convention d'enquête n'a pas déterminé les langues à employer, il\r\nen est décidé par la Commission.\r\n\r\nArticle 12.\r\n\r\nSauf stipulation contraire, les Commissions d'enquête sont formées de la\r\nmanière déterminée par les articles 45 et 57 de la présente Convention.\r\n\r\nArticle 13.\r\n\r\nEn cas de décès, de démission ou d'empêchement, pour quelque cause que\r\nce soit, de l'un des commissaires, ou éventuellement de l'un des\r\nassesseurs, il est pourvu à son remplacement selon le mode fixé pour sa\r\nnomination.\r\n\r\nArticle 14.\r\n\r\nLes Parties ont le droit de nommer auprès de la Commission d'enquête des\r\nagents spéciaux avec la mission de Les représenter et de servir\r\nd'intermédiaires entre Elles et la Commission.\r\n\r\nElles sont, en outre, autorisées à charger des conseils ou avocats\r\nnommés par elles, d'exposer et de soutenir leurs intérêts devant la\r\nCommission.\r\n\r\nArticle 15.\r\n\r\nLe Bureau International de la Cour permanente d'arbitrage sert de greffe\r\naux Commissions qui siègent à La Haye, et mettra ses locaux et son\r\norganisation à la disposition des Puissances contractantes pour le\r\nfonctionnement de la Commission d'enquête.\r\n\r\nArticle 16.\r\n\r\nSi la Commission siège ailleurs qu'à La Haye, elle nomme un Secrétaire\r\nGénéral dont le bureau lui sert de greffe.\r\n\r\nLe greffe est chargé, sous l'autorité du Président, de l'organisation\r\nmatérielle des séances de la Commission, de la rédaction des\r\nprocès-verbaux et, pendant le temps de l'enquête, de la garde des\r\narchives qui seront ensuite versées au Bureau International de La Haye.\r\n\r\nArticle 17.\r\n\r\nEn vue de faciliter l'institution et le fonctionnement des Commissions\r\nd'enquête, les Puissances contractantes recommandent les règles\r\nsuivantes qui seront applicables à la procédure d'enquête en tant que\r\nles Parties n'adopteront pas d'autres règles.\r\n\r\nArticle 18.\r\n\r\nLa Commission réglera les détails de la procédure non prévus dans la\r\nconvention spéciale d'enquête ou dans la présente Convention, et\r\nprocédera à toutes les formalités que comporte l'administration des\r\npreuves.\r\n\r\nArticle 19.\r\n\r\nL'enquête a lieu contradictoirement.\r\n\r\nAux dates prévues, chaque Partie communique à la Commission et à l'autre\r\nPartie les exposés des faits, s'il y a lieu, et, dans tous les cas, les\r\nactes, pièces et documents qu'Elle juge utiles à la découverte de la\r\nvérité, ainsi que la liste des témoins et des experts qu'elle désire\r\nfaire entendre.\r\n\r\nArticle 20.\r\n\r\nLa Commission a la faculté, avec l'assentiment des Parties, de se\r\ntransporter momentanément sur les lieux où elle juge utile de recourir à\r\nce moyen d'information ou d'y déléguer un ou plusieurs de ses membres.\r\nL'autorisation de l'État sur le territoire duquel il doit être procédé à\r\ncette information devra être obtenue.\r\n\r\nArticle 21.\r\n\r\nToutes constatations matérielles, et toutes visites des lieux doivent\r\nêtre faites en présence des agents et conseils des Parties ou eux dûment\r\nappelés.\r\n\r\nArticle 22.\r\n\r\nLa Commission a le droit de solliciter de l'une ou l'autre Partie telles\r\nexplications ou informations qu'elle juge utiles.\r\n\r\nArticle 23.\r\n\r\nLes Parties s'engagent à fournir à la Commission d'enquête, dans la plus\r\nlarge mesure qu'Elles jugeront possible, tous les moyens et toutes les\r\nfacilités nécessaires pour la connaissance complète et l'appréciation\r\nexacte des faits en question.\r\n\r\nElles s'engagent à user des moyens dont Elles disposent d'après leur\r\nlégislation intérieure, pour assurer la comparution des témoins ou des\r\nexperts se trouvant sur leur territoire et cités devant la Commission.\r\n\r\nSi ceux-ci ne peuvent comparaître devant la Commission, Elles feront\r\nprocéder à leur audition devant leurs autorités compétentes.\r\n\r\nArticle 24.\r\n\r\nPour toutes les notifications que la Commission aurait à faire sur le\r\nterritoire d'une tierce Puissance contractante, la Commission\r\ns'adressera directement au Gouvernement de cette Puissance. Il en sera\r\nde même s'il s'agit de faire procéder sur place à l'établissement de\r\ntous moyens de preuve.\r\n\r\nLes requêtes adressées à cet effet seront exécutées suivant les moyens\r\ndont la Puissance requise dispose d'après Sa législation intérieure.\r\nElles ne peuvent être refusées que si cette Puissance les juge de nature\r\nà porter atteinte à Sa souveraineté ou à Sa sécurité.\r\n\r\nLa Commission aura aussi toujours la faculté de recourir à\r\nl'intermédiaire de la Puissance sur le territoire de laquelle elle a son\r\nsiège.\r\n\r\nArticle 25.\r\n\r\nLes témoins et les experts sont appelés à la requête des Parties ou\r\nd'office par la Commission, et, dans tous les cas, par l'intermédiaire\r\ndu Gouvernement de l'État sur le territoire duquel ils se trouvent.\r\n\r\nLes témoins sont entendus, successivement et séparément, en présence des\r\nagents et des conseils et dans un ordre à fixer par la Commission.\r\n\r\nArticle 26.\r\n\r\nL'interrogatoire des témoins est conduit par le Président.\r\n\r\nLes membres de la Commission peuvent néanmoins poser à chaque témoin les\r\nquestions qu'ils croient convenables pour éclaircir ou compléter sa\r\ndéposition, ou pour se renseigner sur tout ce qui concerne le témoin\r\ndans les limites nécessaires à la manifestation de la vérité.\r\n\r\nLes agents et les conseils des Parties ne peuvent interrompre le témoin\r\ndans sa déposition, ni lui faire aucune interpellation directe, mais\r\npeuvent demander au Président de poser au témoin telles questions\r\ncomplémentaires qu'ils jugent utiles.\r\n\r\nArticle 27.\r\n\r\nLe témoin doit déposer sans qu'il lui soit permis de lire aucun projet\r\nécrit. Toutefois, il peut être autorisé par le Président à s'aider de\r\nnotes ou documents si la nature des faits rapportés en nécessite\r\nl'emploi.\r\n\r\nArticle 28.\r\n\r\nProcès-verbal de la déposition du témoin est dressé séance tenante et\r\nlecture en est donnée au témoin. Le témoin peut y faire tels changements\r\net additions que bon lui semble et qui seront consignés à la suite de sa\r\ndéposition.\r\n\r\nLecture faite au témoin de l'ensemble de sa déposition, le témoin est\r\nrequis de signer.\r\n\r\nArticle 29.\r\n\r\nLes agents sont autorisés, au cours ou à la fin de l'enquête, à\r\nprésenter par écrit à la Commission et à l'autre Partie tels dires,\r\nréquisitions ou résumés de fait, qu'ils jugent utiles à la découverte de\r\nla vérité.\r\n\r\nArticle 30.\r\n\r\nLes délibérations de la Commission ont lieu à huis clos et restent\r\nsecrètes.\r\n\r\nToute décision est prise à la majorité des membres de la Commission.\r\n\r\nLe refus d'un membre de prendre part au vote doit être constaté dans le\r\nprocès-verbal.\r\n\r\nArticle 31.\r\n\r\nLes séances de la Commission ne sont publiques et les procès-verbaux et\r\ndocuments de l'enquête ne sont rendus publics qu'en vertu d'une décision\r\nde la Commission, prise avec l'assentiment des Parties.\r\n\r\nArticle 32.\r\n\r\nLes Parties ayant présenté tous les éclaircissements et preuves, tous\r\nles témoins ayant été entendus, le Président prononce la clôture de\r\nl'enquête et la Commission s'ajourne pour délibérer et rédiger son\r\nrapport.\r\n\r\nArticle 33.\r\n\r\nLe rapport est signé par tous les membres de la Commission.\r\n\r\nSi un des membres refuse de signer, mention en est faite; le rapport\r\nreste néanmoins valable.\r\n\r\nArticle 34.\r\n\r\nLe rapport de la Commission est lu en séance publique, les agents et les\r\nconseils des Parties présents ou dûment appelés.\r\n\r\nUn exemplaire du rapport est remis à chaque Partie.\r\n\r\nArticle 35.\r\n\r\nLe rapport de la Commission, limité à la constatation des faits, n'a\r\nnullement le caractère d'une sentence arbitrale. Il laisse aux Parties\r\nune entière liberté pour la suite à donner à cette constatation.\r\n\r\nArticle 36.\r\n\r\nChaque Partie supporte ses propres frais et une part égale des frais de\r\nla Commission.\r\n\r\n_Titre IV.--De l'arbitrage international._\r\n\r\nCHAPITRE I.--_De la Justice arbitrale._\r\n\r\nArticle 37.\r\n\r\nL'arbitrage international a pour objet le règlement de litiges entre les\r\nÉtats par des juges de leur choix et sur la base du respect du droit.\r\n\r\nLe recours à l'arbitrage implique l'engagement de se soumettre de bonne\r\nfoi à la sentence.\r\n\r\nArticle 38.\r\n\r\nDans les questions d'ordre juridique, et en premier lieu, dans les\r\nquestions d'interprétation ou d'application des Conventions\r\ninternationales, l'arbitrage est reconnu par les Puissances\r\ncontractantes comme le moyen le plus efficace et en même temps le plus\r\néquitable de régler les litiges qui n'ont pas été résolus par les voies\r\ndiplomatiques.\r\n\r\nEn conséquence, il serait désirable que, dans les litiges sur les\r\nquestions susmentionnées, les Puissances contractantes eussent, le cas\r\néchéant, recours à l'arbitrage, en tant que les circonstances le\r\npermettraient.\r\n\r\nArticle 39.\r\n\r\nLa Convention d'arbitrage est conclue pour des contestations déjà nées\r\nou pour des contestations éventuelles.\r\n\r\nElle peut concerner tout litige ou seulement les litiges d'une catégorie\r\ndéterminée.\r\n\r\nArticle 40.\r\n\r\nIndépendamment des Traités généraux ou particuliers qui stipulent\r\nactuellement l'obligation du recours à l'arbitrage pour les Puissances\r\ncontractantes, ces Puissances se réservent de conclure des accords\r\nnouveaux, généraux ou particuliers, en vue d'étendre l'arbitrage\r\nobligatoire à tous les cas qu'Elles jugeront possible de lui soumettre.\r\n\r\nCHAPITRE II.--_De la Cour permanente d'arbitrage._\r\n\r\nArticle 41.\r\n\r\nDans le but de faciliter le recours immédiat à l'arbitrage pour les\r\ndifférends internationaux qui n'ont pu être réglés par la voie\r\ndiplomatique, les Puissances contractantes s'engagent à maintenir, telle\r\nqu'elle a été établie par la Première Conférence de la Paix, la Cour\r\npermanente d'arbitrage, accessible en tout temps et fonctionnant, sauf\r\nstipulation contraire des Parties, conformément aux règles de procédure\r\ninsérées dans la présente Convention.\r\n\r\nArticle 42.\r\n\r\nLa Cour permanente est compétente pour tous les cas d'arbitrage, à moins\r\nqu'il n'y ait entente entre les Parties pour l'établissement d'une\r\njuridiction spéciale.\r\n\r\nArticle 43.\r\n\r\nLa cour permanente a son siège à La Haye.\r\n\r\nUn Bureau International sert de greffe à la Cour; il est l'intermédiaire\r\ndes communications relatives aux réunions de celle-ci; il a la garde des\r\narchives et la gestion de toutes les affaires administratives.\r\n\r\nLes Puissances contractantes s'engagent à communiquer au Bureau,\r\naussitôt que possible, une copie certifiée conforme de toute stipulation\r\nd'arbitrage intervenue entre Elles et de toute sentence arbitrale Les\r\nconcernant et rendue par des juridictions spéciales.\r\n\r\nElles s'engagent à communiquer de même au Bureau les lois, règlements\r\net documents constatant éventuellement l'exécution des sentences rendues\r\npar la Cour.\r\n\r\nArticle 44.\r\n\r\nChaque Puissance contractante désigne quatre personnes au plus, d'une\r\ncompétence reconnue dans les questions de droit international, jouissant\r\nde la plus haute considération morale et disposées à accepter les\r\nfonctions d'arbitre.\r\n\r\nLes personnes ainsi désignées sont inscrites, au titre de Membres de la\r\nCour, sur une liste qui sera notifiée à toutes les Puissances\r\ncontractantes par les soins du Bureau.\r\n\r\nToute modification à la liste des arbitres est portée, par les soins du\r\nBureau, à la connaissance des Puissances contractantes.\r\n\r\nDeux ou plusieurs Puissances peuvent s'entendre pour la désignation en\r\ncommun d'un ou de plusieurs Membres.\r\n\r\nLa même personne peut être désignée par des Puissances différentes.\r\n\r\nLes Membres de la Cour sont nommés pour un terme de six ans. Leur mandat\r\npeut être renouvelé.\r\n\r\nEn cas de décès ou de retraite d'un Membre de la Cour, il est pourvu à\r\nson remplacement selon le mode fixé pour sa nomination, et pour une\r\nnouvelle période de six ans.\r\n\r\nArticle 45.\r\n\r\nLorsque les Puissances contractantes veulent s'adresser à la Cour\r\npermanente pour le règlement d'un différend survenu entre Elles, le\r\nchoix des arbitres appelés à former le Tribunal compétent pour statuer\r\nsur ce différend, doit être fait dans la liste générale des Membres de\r\nla Cour.\r\n\r\nA défaut de constitution du Tribunal arbitral par l'accord des Parties,\r\nil est procédé de la manière suivante:\r\n\r\nChaque Partie nomme deux arbitres, dont un seulement peut être son\r\nnational ou choisi parmi ceux qui ont été désignés par Elle comme\r\nMembres de la Cour permanente. Ces arbitres choisissent ensemble un\r\nsurarbitre.\r\n\r\nEn cas de partage des voix, le choix du surarbitre est confié à une\r\nPuissance tierce, désignée de commun accord par les Parties.\r\n\r\nSi l'accord ne s'établit pas à ce sujet, chaque Partie désigne une\r\nPuissance différente et le choix du surarbitre est fait de concert par\r\nles Puissances ainsi désignées.\r\n\r\nSi, dans un délai de deux mois, ces deux Puissances n'ont pu tomber\r\nd'accord, chacune d'Elles présente deux candidats pris sur la liste des\r\nMembres de la Cour permanente, en dehors des Membres désignés par les\r\nParties et n'étant les nationaux d'aucune d'Elles. Le sort détermine\r\nlequel des candidats ainsi présentés sera le surarbitre.\r\n\r\nArticle 46.\r\n\r\nDès que le Tribunal est composé, les Parties notifient au Bureau leur\r\ndécision de s'adresser à la Cour, le texte de leur compromis, et les\r\nnoms des arbitres.\r\n\r\nLe Bureau communique sans délai à chaque arbitre le compromis et les\r\nnoms des autres Membres du Tribunal.\r\n\r\nLe Tribunal se réunit à la date fixée par les Parties. Le Bureau\r\npourvoit à son installation.\r\n\r\nLes Membres du Tribunal, dans l'exercice de leurs fonctions et en dehors\r\nde leur pays, jouissent des privilèges et immunités diplomatiques.\r\n\r\nArticle 47.\r\n\r\nLe Bureau est autorisé à mettre ses locaux et son organisation à la\r\ndisposition des Puissances contractantes pour le fonctionnement de toute\r\njuridiction spéciale d'arbitrage.\r\n\r\nLa juridiction de la Cour permanente peut être étendue, dans les\r\nconditions prescrites par les règlements, aux litiges existant entre des\r\nPuissances non contractantes ou entre des Puissances contractantes et\r\ndes Puissances non contractantes, si les Parties sont convenues de\r\nrecourir à cette juridiction.\r\n\r\nArticle 48.\r\n\r\nLes Puissances contractantes considèrent comme un devoir, dans le cas où\r\nun conflit aigu menacerait d'éclater entre deux ou plusieurs d'entre\r\nElles, de rappeler à celles-ci que la Cour permanente leur est ouverte.\r\n\r\nEn conséquence, Elles déclarent que le fait de rappeler aux Parties en\r\nconflit les dispositions de la présente Convention, et le conseil donné,\r\ndans l'intérêt supérieur de la paix, de s'adresser à la Cour permanente,\r\nne peuvent être considérés que comme actes de bons offices.\r\n\r\nEn cas de conflit entre deux Puissances, l'une d'Elles pourra toujours\r\nadresser au Bureau International une note contenant sa déclaration\r\nqu'Elle serait disposée à soumettre le différend à un arbitrage.\r\n\r\nLe Bureau devra porter aussitôt la déclaration à la connaissance de\r\nl'autre Puissance.\r\n\r\nArticle 49.\r\n\r\nLe Conseil administratif permanent, composé des Représentants\r\ndiplomatiques des Puissances contractantes accrédités à La Haye et du\r\nMinistre des Affaires Étrangères des Pays-Bas, qui remplit les fonctions\r\nde Président, a la direction et le contrôle du Bureau International.\r\n\r\nLe Conseil arrête son règlement d'ordre ainsi que tous autres règlements\r\nnécessaires.\r\n\r\nIl décide toutes les questions administratives qui pourraient surgir\r\ntouchant le fonctionnement de la Cour.\r\n\r\nIl a tout pouvoir quant à la nomination, la suspension ou la révocation\r\ndes fonctionnaires et employés du Bureau.\r\n\r\nIl fixe les traitements et salaires, et contrôle la dépense générale.\r\n\r\nLa présence de neuf membres dans les réunions dûment convoquées suffit\r\npour permettre au Conseil de délibérer valablement. Les décisions sont\r\nprises à la majorité des voix.\r\n\r\nLe Conseil communique sans délai aux Puissances contractantes les\r\nrèglements adoptés par lui. Il Leur présente chaque année un rapport sur\r\nles travaux de la Cour, sur le fonctionnement des services\r\nadministratifs et sur les dépenses. Le rapport contient également un\r\nrésumé du contenu essentiel des documents communiqués au Bureau par les\r\nPuissances en vertu de l'article 43 alinéas 3 et 4.\r\n\r\nArticle 50.\r\n\r\nLes frais du Bureau seront supportés par les Puissances contractantes\r\ndans la proportion établie pour le Bureau international de l'Union\r\npostale universelle.\r\n\r\nLes frais à la charge des Puissances adhérentes seront comptés à partir\r\ndu jour où leur adhésion produit ses effets.\r\n\r\nCHAPITRE III.--_De la procédure arbitrale._\r\n\r\nArticle 51.\r\n\r\nEn vue de favoriser le développement de l'arbitrage, les Puissances\r\ncontractantes ont arrêté les règles suivantes qui sont applicables à la\r\nprocédure arbitrale, en tant que les Parties ne sont pas convenues\r\nd'autres règles.\r\n\r\nArticle 52.\r\n\r\nLes Puissances qui recourent à l'arbitrage signent un compromis dans\r\nlequel sont déterminés l'objet du litige, le délai de nomination des\r\narbitres, la forme, l'ordre et les délais dans lesquels la communication\r\nvisée par l'article 63 devra être faite, et le montant de la somme que\r\nchaque Partie aura à déposer à titre d'avance pour les frais.\r\n\r\nLe compromis détermine également, s'il y a lieu, le mode de nomination\r\ndes arbitres, tous pouvoirs spéciaux éventuels du Tribunal, son siège,\r\nla langue dont il fera usage et celles dont l'emploi sera autorisé\r\ndevant lui, et généralement toutes les conditions dont les Parties sont\r\nconvenues.\r\n\r\nArticle 53.\r\n\r\nLa Cour permanente est compétente pour l'établissement du compromis, si\r\nles Parties sont d'accord pour s'en remettre à elle.\r\n\r\nElle est également compétente, même si la demande est faite seulement\r\npar l'une des Parties, après qu'un accord par la voie diplomatique a été\r\nvainement essayé, quand il s'agit:\r\n\r\n1'o. d'un différend rentrant dans un Traité d'arbitrage général conclu\r\nou renouvelé après la mise en vigueur de cette Convention et qui prévoit\r\npour chaque différend un compromis et n'exclut pour l'établissement de\r\nce dernier ni explicitement ni implicitement la compétence de la Cour.\r\nToutefois, le recours à la Cour n'a pas lieu si l'autre Partie déclare\r\nqu'à son avis le différend n'appartient pas à la catégorie des\r\ndifférends à soumettre à un arbitrage obligatoire, à moins que le Traité\r\nd'arbitrage ne confère au Tribunal arbitral le pouvoir de décider cette\r\nquestion préalable;\r\n\r\n2'o. d'un différend provenant de dettes contractuelles réclamées à une\r\nPuissance par une autre Puissance comme dues à ses nationaux, et pour la\r\nsolution duquel l'offre d'arbitrage a été acceptée. Cette disposition\r\nn'est pas applicable si l'acceptation a été subordonnée à la condition\r\nque le compromis soit établi selon un autre mode.\r\n\r\nArticle 54.\r\n\r\nDans les cas prévus par l'article précédent, le compromis sera établi\r\npar une commission composée de cinq membres désignés de la manière\r\nprévue à l'article 45 alinéas 3 à 6.\r\n\r\nLe cinquième membre est de droit Président de la commission.\r\n\r\nArticle 55.\r\n\r\nLes fonctions arbitrales peuvent être conférées à un arbitre unique ou à\r\nplusieurs arbitres désignés par les Parties à leur gré, ou choisis par\r\nElles parmi les Membres de la Cour permanente d'arbitrage établie par la\r\nprésente Convention.\r\n\r\nA défaut de constitution du Tribunal par l'accord des Parties, il est\r\nprocédé de la manière indiquée à l'article 45 alinéas 3 à 6.\r\n\r\nArticle 56.\r\n\r\nLorsqu'un Souverain ou un Chef d'Etat est choisi pour arbitre, la\r\nprocédure arbitrale est réglée par Lui.\r\n\r\nArticle 57.\r\n\r\nLe surarbitre est de droit Président du Tribunal.\r\n\r\nLorsque le Tribunal ne comprend pas de surarbitre, il nomme lui-même son\r\nPrésident.\r\n\r\nArticle 58.\r\n\r\nEn cas d'établissement du compromis par une commission, telle qu'elle\r\nest visée à l'article 54, et sauf stipulation contraire, la commission\r\nelle-même formera le Tribunal d'arbitrage.\r\n\r\nArticle 59.\r\n\r\nEn cas de décès, de démission ou d'empêchement, pour quelque cause que\r\nce soit, de l'un des arbitres, il est pourvu à son remplacement selon le\r\nmode fixé pour sa nomination.\r\n\r\nArticle 60.\r\n\r\nA défaut de désignation par les Parties, le Tribunal siège à La Haye.\r\n\r\nLe Tribunal ne peut siéger sur le territoire d'une tierce Puissance\r\nqu'avec l'assentiment de celle-ci.\r\n\r\nLe siège une fois fixé ne peut être changé par le Tribunal qu'avec\r\nl'assentiment des Parties.\r\n\r\nArticle 61.\r\n\r\nSi le compromis n'a pas déterminé les langues à employer, il en est\r\ndécidé par le Tribunal.\r\n\r\nArticle 62.\r\n\r\nLes Parties ont le droit de nommer auprès du Tribunal des agents\r\nspéciaux, avec la mission de servir d'intermédiaires entre Elles et le\r\nTribunal.\r\n\r\nElles sont en outre autorisées à charger de la défense de leurs droits\r\net intérêts devant le Tribunal, des conseils ou avocats nommés par Elles\r\nà cet effet.\r\n\r\nLes Membres de la Cour permanente ne peuvent exercer les fonctions\r\nd'agents, conseils ou avocats, qu'en faveur de la Puissance qui les a\r\nnommés Membres de la Cour.\r\n\r\nArticle 63.\r\n\r\nLa procédure arbitrale comprend en règle générale deux phases\r\ndistinctes: l'instruction écrite et les débats.\r\n\r\nL'instruction écrite consiste dans la communication faite par les agents\r\nrespectifs, aux membres du Tribunal et à la Partie adverse, des\r\nmémoires, des contre-mémoires et, au besoin, des répliques; les Parties\r\ny joignent toutes pièces et documents invoqués dans la cause. Cette\r\ncommunication aura lieu, directement ou par l'intermédiaire du Bureau\r\nInternational, dans l'ordre et dans les délais déterminés par le\r\ncompromis.\r\n\r\nLes délais fixés par le compromis pourront être prolongés de commun\r\naccord par les Parties, ou par le Tribunal quand il le juge nécessaire\r\npour arriver à une décision juste.\r\n\r\nLes débats consistent dans le développement oral des moyens des Parties\r\ndevant le Tribunal.\r\n\r\nArticle 64.\r\n\r\nToute pièce produite par l'une des Parties doit être communiquée, en\r\ncopie certifiée conforme, à l'autre Partie.\r\n\r\nArticle 65.\r\n\r\nA moins de circonstances spéciales, le Tribunal ne se réunit qu'après la\r\nclôture de l'instruction.\r\n\r\nArticle 66.\r\n\r\nLes débats sont dirigés par le Président.\r\n\r\nIls ne sont publics qu'en vertu d'une décision du Tribunal, prise avec\r\nl'assentiment des Parties.\r\n\r\nIls sont consignés dans des procès-verbaux rédigés par des secrétaires\r\nque nomme le Président. Ces procès-verbaux sont signés par le Président\r\net par un des secrétaires; ils ont seuls caractère authentique.\r\n\r\nArticle 67.\r\n\r\nL'instruction étant close, le Tribunal a le droit d'écarter du débat\r\ntous actes ou documents nouveaux qu'une des Parties voudrait lui\r\nsoumettre sans le consentement de l'autre.\r\n\r\nArticle 68.\r\n\r\nLe Tribunal demeure libre de prendre en considération les actes ou\r\ndocuments nouveaux sur lesquels les agents ou conseils des Parties\r\nappelleraient son attention.\r\n\r\nEn ce cas, le Tribunal a le droit de requérir la production de ces actes\r\nou documents, sauf l'obligation d'en donner connaissance à la Partie\r\nadverse.\r\n\r\nArticle 69.\r\n\r\nLe Tribunal peut, en outre, requérir des agents des Parties la\r\nproduction de tous actes et demander toutes explications nécessaires. En\r\ncas de refus, le Tribunal en prend acte.\r\n\r\nArticle 70.\r\n\r\nLes agents et les conseils des Parties sont autorisés à présenter\r\noralement au Tribunal tous les moyens qu'ils jugent utiles à la défense\r\nde leur cause.\r\n\r\nArticle 71.\r\n\r\nIls ont le droit de soulever des exceptions et des incidents. Les\r\ndécisions du Tribunal sur ces points sont définitives et ne peuvent\r\ndonner lieu à aucune discussion ultérieure.\r\n\r\nArticle 72.\r\n\r\nLes membres du Tribunal ont le droit de poser des questions aux agents\r\net aux conseils des Parties et de leur demander des éclaircissements sur\r\nles points douteux.\r\n\r\nNi les questions posées, ni les observations faites par les membres du\r\nTribunal pendant le cours des débats ne peuvent être regardées comme\r\nl'expression des opinions du Tribunal en général ou de ses membres en\r\nparticulier.\r\n\r\nArticle 73.\r\n\r\nLe Tribunal est autorisé à déterminer sa compétence en interprétant le\r\ncompromis ainsi que les autres Traités qui peuvent être invoqués dans la\r\nmatière, et en appliquant les principes du droit.\r\n\r\nArticle 74.\r\n\r\nLe Tribunal a le droit de rendre des ordonnances de procédure pour la\r\ndirection du procès, de déterminer les formes, l'ordre et les délais\r\ndans lesquels chaque Partie devra prendre ses conclusions finales, et de\r\nprocéder à toutes les formalités que comporte l'administration des\r\npreuves.\r\n\r\nArticle 75.\r\n\r\nLes Parties s'engagent à fournir au Tribunal, dans la plus large mesure\r\nqu'Elles jugeront possible, tous les moyens nécessaires pour la décision\r\ndu litige.\r\n\r\nArticle 76.\r\n\r\nPour toutes les notifications que le Tribunal aurait à faire sur le\r\nterritoire d'une tierce Puissance contractante, le Tribunal s'adressera\r\ndirectement au Gouvernement de cette Puissance. Il en sera de même s'il\r\ns'agit de faire procéder sur place à l'établissement de tous moyens de\r\npreuve.\r\n\r\nLes requêtes adressées à cet effet seront exécutées suivant les moyens\r\ndont la Puissance requise dispose d'après sa législation intérieure.\r\nElles ne peuvent être refusées que si cette Puissance les juge de nature\r\nà porter atteinte à sa souveraineté ou à sa sécurité.\r\n\r\nLe Tribunal aura aussi toujours la faculté de recourir à l'intermédiaire\r\nde la Puissance sur le territoire de laquelle il a son siège.\r\n\r\nArticle 77.\r\n\r\nLes agents et les conseils des Parties ayant présenté tous les\r\néclaircissements et preuves à l'appui de leur cause, le Président\r\nprononce la clôture des débats.\r\n\r\nArticle 78.\r\n\r\nLes délibérations du Tribunal ont lieu à huis clos et restent secrètes.\r\n\r\nToute décision est prise à la majorité de ses membres.\r\n\r\nArticle 79.\r\n\r\nLa sentence arbitrale est motivée. Elle mentionne les noms des arbitres;\r\nelle est signée par le Président et par le greffier ou le secrétaire\r\nfaisant fonctions de greffier.\r\n\r\nArticle 80.\r\n\r\nLa sentence est lue en séance publique, les agents et les conseils des\r\nParties présents ou dûment appelés.\r\n\r\nArticle 81.\r\n\r\nLa sentence, dûment prononcée et notifiée aux agents des Parties, décide\r\ndéfinitivement et sans appel la contestation.\r\n\r\nArticle 82.\r\n\r\nTout différend qui pourrait surgir entre les Parties, concernant\r\nl'interprétation et l'exécution de la sentence, sera, sauf stipulation\r\ncontraire, soumis au jugement du Tribunal qui l'a rendue.\r\n\r\nArticle 83.\r\n\r\nLes Parties peuvent se réserver dans le compromis de demander la\r\nrévision de la sentence arbitrale.\r\n\r\nDans ce cas, et sauf stipulation contraire, la demande doit être\r\nadressée au Tribunal qui a rendu la sentence. Elle ne peut être motivée\r\nque par la découverte d'un fait nouveau qui eût été de nature à exercer\r\nune influence décisive sur la sentence et qui, lors de la clôture des\r\ndébats, était inconnu du Tribunal lui-même et de la Partie qui a demandé\r\nla révision.\r\n\r\nLa procédure de révision ne peut être ouverte que par une décision du\r\nTribunal constatant expressément l'existence du fait nouveau, lui\r\nreconnaissant les caractères prévus par le paragraphe précédent et\r\ndéclarant à ce titre la demande recevable.\r\n\r\nLe compromis détermine le délai dans lequel la demande de révision doit\r\nêtre formée.\r\n\r\nArticle 84.\r\n\r\nLa sentence arbitrale n'est obligatoire que pour les Parties en litige.\r\n\r\nLorsqu'il s'agit de l'interprétation d'une convention à laquelle ont\r\nparticipé d'autres Puissances que les Parties en litige, celles-ci\r\navertissent en temps utile toutes les Puissances signataires. Chacune de\r\nces Puissances a le droit d'intervenir au procès. Si une ou plusieurs\r\nd'entre Elles ont profité de cette faculté, l'interprétation contenue\r\ndans la sentence est également obligatoire à leur égard.\r\n\r\nArticle 85.\r\n\r\nChaque Partie supporte ses propres frais et une part égale des frais du\r\nTribunal.\r\n\r\nCHAPITRE IV.--_De la procédure sommaire d'arbitrage._\r\n\r\nArticle 86.\r\n\r\nEn vue de faciliter le fonctionnement de la justice arbitrale, lorsqu'il\r\ns'agit de litiges de nature à comporter une procédure sommaire, les\r\nPuissances contractantes arrêtent les règles ci-après qui seront suivies\r\nen l'absence de stipulations différentes, et sous réserve, le cas\r\néchéant, de l'application des dispositions du chapitre III. qui ne\r\nseraient pas contraires.\r\n\r\nArticle 87.\r\n\r\nChacune des Parties en litige nomme un arbitre. Les deux arbitres ainsi\r\ndésignés choisissent un surarbitre. S'ils ne tombent pas d'accord à ce\r\nsujet, chacun présente deux candidats pris sur la liste générale des\r\nMembres de la Cour permanente, en dehors des Membres indiqués par\r\nchacune des Parties Elles-mêmes et n'étant les nationaux d'aucune\r\nd'Elles; le sort détermine lequel des candidats ainsi présentés sera le\r\nsurarbitre.\r\n\r\nLe surarbitre préside le Tribunal, qui rend ses décisions à la majorité\r\ndes voix.\r\n\r\nArticle 88.\r\n\r\nA défaut d'accord préalable, le Tribunal fixe, dès qu'il est constitué,\r\nle délai dans lequel les deux Parties devront lui soumettre leurs\r\nmémoires respectifs.\r\n\r\nArticle 89.\r\n\r\nChaque Partie est représentée devant le Tribunal par un agent qui sert\r\nd'intermédiaire entre le Tribunal et le Gouvernement qui l'a désigné.\r\n\r\nArticle 90.\r\n\r\nLa procédure a lieu exclusivement par écrit. Toutefois, chaque Partie a\r\nle droit demander la comparution de témoins et d'experts. Le Tribunal a,\r\nde son côté, la faculté de demander des explications orales aux agents\r\ndes deux Parties, ainsi qu'aux experts et aux témoins dont il juge la\r\ncomparution utile.\r\n\r\n_Titre V.--Dispositions finales._\r\n\r\nArticle 91.\r\n\r\nLa présente Convention dûment ratifiée remplacera, dans les rapports\r\nentre les Puissances contractantes, la Convention pour le règlement\r\npacifique des conflits internationaux du 29 juillet 1899.\r\n\r\nArticle 92.\r\n\r\nLa présente Convention sera ratifiée aussitôt que possible.\r\n\r\nLes ratifications seront déposées à La Haye.\r\n\r\nLe premier dépôt de ratifications sera constaté par un procès-verbal\r\nsigné par les représentants des Puissances qui y prennent part et par le\r\nMinistre des Affaires Etrangères des Pays-Bas.\r\n\r\nLes dépôts ultérieurs de ratifications se feront au moyen d'une\r\nnotification écrite, adressée au Gouvernement des Pays-Bas et\r\naccompagnée de l'instrument de ratification.\r\n\r\nCopie certifiée conforme du procès-verbal relatif au premier dépôt de\r\nratifications, des notifications mentionnées à l'alinéa précédent, ainsi\r\nque des instruments de ratification, sera immédiatement remise, par les\r\nsoins du Gouvernement des Pays-Bas et par la voie diplomatique aux\r\nPuissances conviées à la Deuxième Conférence de la Paix, ainsi qu'aux\r\nautres Puissances qui auront adhéré à la Convention. Dans les cas visés\r\npar l'alinéa précédent, ledit Gouvernement Leur fera connaître en même\r\ntemps la date à laquelle il a reçu la notification.\r\n\r\nArticle 93.\r\n\r\nLes Puissances non signataires qui ont été conviées à la Deuxième\r\nConférence de la Paix pourront adhérer à la présente Convention.\r\n\r\nLa Puissance qui désire adhérer notifie par écrit son intention au\r\nGouvernement des Pays-Bas en lui transmettant l'acte d'adhésion qui sera\r\ndéposé dans les archives dudit Gouvernement.\r\n\r\nCe Gouvernement transmettra immédiatement à toutes les autres Puissances\r\nconviées à la Deuxième Conférence de la Paix copie certifiée conforme de\r\nla notification ainsi que l'acte d'adhésion, en indiquant la date à\r\nlaquelle il a reçu la notification.\r\n\r\nArticle 94.\r\n\r\nLes conditions auxquelles les Puissances qui n'ont pas été conviées à la\r\nDeuxième Conférence de la Paix, pourront adhérer à la présente\r\nConvention formeront l'objet d'une entente ultérieure entre les\r\nPuissances contractantes.\r\n\r\nArticle 95.\r\n\r\nLa présente Convention produira effet, pour les Puissances qui auront\r\nparticipé au premier dépôt de ratifications, soixante jours après la\r\ndate du procès-verbal de ce dépôt et, pour les Puissances qui\r\nratifieront ultérieurement ou qui adhéreront, soixante jours après que\r\nla notification de leur ratification ou de leur adhésion aura été reçue\r\npar le Gouvernement des Pays-Bas.\r\n\r\nArticle 96.\r\n\r\nS'il arrivait qu'une des Puissances contractantes voulût dénoncer la\r\nprésente Convention, la dénonciation sera notifiée par écrit au\r\nGouvernement des Pays-Bas qui communiquera immédiatement copie certifiée\r\nconforme de la notification à toutes les autres Puissances en leur\r\nfaisant savoir la date à laquelle il l'a reçue.\r\n\r\nLa dénonciation ne produira ses effets qu'à l'égard de la Puissance qui\r\nl'aura notifiée et un an après que la notification en sera parvenue au\r\nGouvernement des Pays-Bas.\r\n\r\nArticle 97.\r\n\r\nUn registre tenu par le Ministère des Affaires Étrangères des Pays-Bas\r\nindiquera la date du dépôt de ratifications effectué en vertu de\r\nl'article 92 alinéas 3 et 4, ainsi que la date à laquelle auront été\r\nreçues les notifications d'adhésion (article 93 alinéa 2) ou de\r\ndénonciation (article 96 alinéa 1).\r\n\r\nChaque Puissance contractante est admise à prendre connaissance de ce\r\nregistre et à en demander des extraits certifiés conformes.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONVENTION II.\r\n\r\n      CONVENTION RESPECTING THE LIMITATION OF THE EMPLOYMENT OF\r\n      FORCE FOR THE RECOVERY OF CONTRACT DEBTS.\r\n\r\nArticle premier.\r\n\r\nLes Puissances contractantes sont convenues de ne pas avoir recours à la\r\nforce armée pour le recouvrement de dettes contractuelles réclamées au\r\nGouvernement d'un pays par le Gouvernement d'un autre pays comme dues à\r\nses nationaux.\r\n\r\nToutefois, cette stipulation ne pourra être appliquée quand l'État\r\ndébiteur refuse ou laisse sans réponse une offre d'arbitrage, ou, en cas\r\nd'acceptation, rend impossible l'établissement du compromis, ou, après\r\nl'arbitrage, manque de se conformer à la sentence rendue.\r\n\r\nArticle 2.\r\n\r\nIl est de plus convenu que l'arbitrage, mentionné dans l'alinéa 2 de\r\nl'article précédent, sera soumis à la procédure prévue par le titre IV\r\nchapitre 3 de la Convention de La Haye pour le règlement pacifique des\r\nconflits internationaux. Le jugement arbitral détermine, sauf les\r\narrangements particuliers des Parties, le bien-fondé de la réclamation,\r\nle montant de la dette, le temps et le mode de paiement.\r\n\r\nArticle 3.\r\n\r\nLa présente Convention sera ratifiée aussitôt que possible.\r\n\r\nLes ratifications seront déposées à La Haye.\r\n\r\nLe premier dépôt de ratifications sera constaté par un procès-verbal\r\nsigné par les représentants des Puissances qui y prennent part et par le\r\nMinistre des Affaires Étrangères des Pays-Bas.\r\n\r\nLes dépôts ultérieurs de ratifications se feront au moyen d'une\r\nnotification écrite, adressée au Gouvernement des Pays-Bas et\r\naccompagnée de l'instrument de ratification.\r\n\r\nCopie certifiée conforme du procès-verbal relatif au premier dépôt de\r\nratifications, des notifications mentionnées à l'alinéa précédent, ainsi\r\nque des instruments de ratification, sera immédiatement remise, par les\r\nsoins du Gouvernement des Pays-Bas et par la voie diplomatique, aux\r\nPuissances conviées à la Deuxième Conférence de la Paix, ainsi qu'aux\r\nautres Puissances qui auront adhéré à la Convention.

En cas de capture par l'ennemi, les\r\nuns et les autres ont droit au traitement des prisonniers de guerre.\r\n\r\nCHAPITRE II.--_Des prisonniers de guerre._\r\n\r\nArticle 4.\r\n\r\nLes prisonniers de guerre sont au pouvoir du Gouvernement ennemi, mais\r\nnon des individus ou des corps qui les ont capturés.\r\n\r\nIls doivent être traités avec humanité.\r\n\r\nTout ce qui leur appartient personnellement, excepté les armes, les\r\nchevaux et les papiers militaires, reste leur propriété.\r\n\r\nArticle 5.\r\n\r\nLes prisonniers de guerre peuvent être assujettis à l'internement dans\r\nune ville, forteresse, camp ou localité quelconque, avec obligation de\r\nne pas s'en éloigner au delà de certaines limites déterminées; mais ils\r\nne peuvent être enfermés que par mesure de sûreté indispensable, et\r\nseulement pendant la durée des circonstances qui nécessitent cette\r\nmesure.\r\n\r\nArticle 6.\r\n\r\nL'État peut employer, comme travailleurs, les prisonniers de guerre,\r\nselon leur grade et leurs aptitudes, à l'exception des officiers. Ces\r\ntravaux ne seront pas excessifs et n'auront aucun rapport avec les\r\nopérations de la guerre.\r\n\r\nLes prisonniers peuvent être autorisés à travailler pour le compte\r\nd'administrations publiques ou de particuliers, ou pour leur propre\r\ncompte.\r\n\r\nLes travaux faits pour l'État sont payés d'après les tarifs en vigueur\r\npour les militaires de l'armée nationale exécutant les mêmes travaux,\r\nou, s'il n'en existe pas, d'après un tarif en rapport avec les travaux\r\nexécutés.\r\n\r\nLorsque les travaux ont lieu pour le compte d'autres administrations\r\npubliques ou pour des particuliers, les conditions en sont réglées\r\nd'accord avec l'autorité militaire.\r\n\r\nLe salaire des prisonniers contribuera à adoucir leur position, et le\r\nsurplus leur sera compté au moment de leur libération, sauf défalcation\r\ndes frais d'entretien.\r\n\r\nArticle 7.\r\n\r\nLe Gouvernement au pouvoir duquel se trouvent les prisonniers de guerre\r\nest chargé de leur entretien.\r\n\r\nA défaut d'une entente spéciale entre les belligérants, les prisonniers\r\nde guerre seront traités pour la nourriture, le couchage et\r\nl'habillement, sur le même pied que les troupes du Gouvernement qui les\r\naura capturés.\r\n\r\nArticle 8.\r\n\r\nLes prisonniers de guerre seront soumis aux lois, règlements et ordres\r\nen vigueur dans l'armée de l'État au pouvoir duquel ils se trouvent.\r\nTout acte d'insubordination autorise, à leur égard, les mesures de\r\nrigueur nécessaires.\r\n\r\nLes prisonniers évadés, qui seraient repris avant d'avoir pu rejoindre\r\nleur armée ou avant de quitter le territoire occupé par l'armée qui les\r\naura capturés, sont passibles de peines disciplinaires.\r\n\r\nLes prisonniers qui, après avoir réussi à s'évader, sont de nouveau\r\nfaits prisonniers, ne sont passibles d'aucune peine pour la fuite\r\nantérieure.\r\n\r\nArticle 9.\r\n\r\nChaque prisonnier de guerre est tenu de déclarer, s'il est interrogé à\r\nce sujet, ses véritables noms et grade et, dans le cas où il\r\nenfreindrait cette règle, il s'exposerait à une restriction des\r\navantages accordés aux prisonniers de guerre de sa catégorie.\r\n\r\nArticle 10.\r\n\r\nLes prisonniers de guerre peuvent être mis en liberté sur parole, si les\r\nlois de leur pays les y autorisent, et, en pareil cas, ils sont obligés,\r\nsous la garantie de leur honneur personnel, de remplir scrupuleusement,\r\ntant vis-à-vis de leur propre Gouvernement que vis-à-vis de celui qui\r\nles a faits prisonniers, les engagements qu'ils auraient contractés.\r\n\r\nDans le même cas, leur propre Gouvernement est tenu de n'exiger ni\r\naccepter d'eux aucun service contraire à la parole donnée.\r\n\r\nArticle 11.\r\n\r\nUn prisonnier de guerre ne peut être contraint d'accepter sa liberté sur\r\nparole; de même le Gouvernement ennemi n'est pas obligé d'accéder à la\r\ndemande du prisonnier réclamant sa mise en liberté sur parole.\r\n\r\nArticle 12.\r\n\r\nTout prisonnier de guerre, libéré sur parole et repris portant les armes\r\ncontre le Gouvernement envers lequel il s'était engagé d'honneur, ou\r\ncontre les alliés de celui-ci, perd le droit au traitement des\r\nprisonniers de guerre et peut être traduit devant les tribunaux.\r\n\r\nArticle 13.\r\n\r\nLes individus qui suivent une armée sans en faire directement partie,\r\ntels que les correspondants et les reporters de journaux, les\r\nvivandiers, les fournisseurs, qui tombent au pouvoir de l'ennemi et que\r\ncelui-ci juge utile de détenir, ont droit au traitement des prisonniers\r\nde guerre, à condition qu'ils soient munis d'une légitimation de\r\nl'autorité militaire de l'armée qu'ils accompagnaient.\r\n\r\nArticle 14.\r\n\r\nIl est constitué, dès le début des hostilités, dans chacun des États\r\nbelligérants, et, le cas échéant, dans les pays neutres qui auront\r\nrecueilli des belligérants sur leur territoire, un bureau de\r\nrenseignements sur les prisonniers de guerre.

La fiche individuelle sera\r\nremise au Gouvernement de l'autre belligérant après la conclusion de la\r\npaix.\r\n\r\nLe bureau de renseignements est également chargé de recueillir et de\r\ncentraliser tous les objets d'un usage personnel, valeurs, lettres,\r\netc., qui seront trouvés sur les champs de bataille ou délaissés par des\r\nprisonniers libérés sur parole, échangés, évadés ou décédés dans les\r\nhôpitaux et ambulances, et de les transmettre aux intéressés.\r\n\r\nArticle 15.\r\n\r\nLes sociétés de secours pour les prisonniers de guerre, régulièrement\r\nconstituées selon la loi de leur pays et ayant pour objet d'être les\r\nintermédiaires de l'action charitable, recevront, de la part des\r\nbelligérants, pour elles et pour leurs agents dûment accrédités, toute\r\nfacilité, dans les limites tracées par les nécessités militaires et les\r\nrègles administratives, pour accomplir efficacement leur tâche\r\nd'humanité. Les délégués de ces sociétés pourront être admis à\r\ndistribuer des secours dans les dépôts d'internement, ainsi qu'aux lieux\r\nd'étape des prisonniers rapatriés, moyennant une permission personnelle\r\ndélivrée par l'autorité militaire, et en prenant l'engagement par écrit\r\nde se soumettre à toutes les mesures d'ordre et de police que celle-ci\r\nprescrirait.\r\n\r\nArticle 16.\r\n\r\nLes bureaux de renseignements jouissent de la franchise de port. Les\r\nlettres, mandats et articles d'argent, ainsi que les colis postaux\r\ndestinés aux prisonniers de guerre ou expédiés par eux, seront\r\naffranchis de toutes les taxes postales, aussi bien dans les pays\r\nd'origine et de destination que dans les pays intermédiaires.\r\n\r\nLes dons et secours en nature destinés aux prisonniers de guerre seront\r\nadmis en franchise de tous droits d'entrée

de même grade du pays où ils sont retenus, à charge de\r\nremboursement par leur Gouvernement.\r\n\r\nArticle 18.\r\n\r\nToute latitude est laissée aux prisonniers de guerre pour l'exercice de\r\nleur religion, y compris l'assistance aux offices de leur culte, à la\r\nseule condition de se conformer aux mesures d'ordre et de police\r\nprescrites par l'autorité militaire.\r\n\r\nArticle 19.\r\n\r\nLes testaments des prisonniers de guerre sont reçus ou dressés dans les\r\nmêmes conditions que pour les militaires de l'armée nationale.\r\n\r\nOn suivra également les mêmes règles en ce qui concerne les pièces\r\nrelatives à la constatation des décès, ainsi que pour l'inhumation des\r\nprisonniers de guerre, en tenant compte de leur grade et de leur rang.\r\n\r\nArticle 20.\r\n\r\nAprès la conclusion de la paix, le rapatriement des prisonniers de\r\nguerre s'effectuera dans le plus bref délai possible.\r\n\r\nCHAPITRE III.--_Des malades et des

seraient impérieusement\r\n  commandées par les nécessités de la guerre;\r\n\r\n  (_h_) de déclarer éteints, suspendus ou non recevables en justice,\r\n  les droits et actions des nationaux de la Partie adverse.\r\n\r\nIl est également interdit à un belligérant de forcer les nationaux de la\r\nPartie adverse à prendre part aux opérations de guerre dirigées contre\r\nleur pays, même dans le cas où ils auraient été à son service avant le\r\ncommencement de la guerre.\r\n\r\nArticle 24.\r\n\r\nLes ruses de guerre et l'emploi des moyens nécessaires pour se procurer\r\ndes renseignements sur l'ennemi et sur le terrain sont considérés comme\r\nlicites.\r\n\r\nArticle 25.\r\n\r\nIl est interdit d'attaquer ou de bombarder, par quelque moyen que ce\r\nsoit des villes, villages, habitations ou bâtiments qui ne sont pas\r\ndéfendus.\r\n\r\nArticle 26.\r\n\r\nLe commandant des troupes assaillantes, avant d'entreprendre le\r\nbombardement, et sauf le cas d'attaque de vive force, devra faire tout\r\nce qui dépend de lui pour en avertir les autorités.\r\n\r\nArticle 27.\r\n\r\nDans les sièges et bombardements, toutes les mesures nécessaires doivent\r\nêtre prises pour épargner, autant que possible, les édifices consacrés\r\naux cultes, aux arts, aux sciences et à la bienfaisance, les monuments\r\nhistoriques, les hôpitaux et les lieux de rassemblement de malades et de\r\nblessés, à condition qu'ils ne soient pas employés en même temps à un\r\nbut militaire.\r\n\r\nLe devoir des assiégés est de désigner ces édifices ou lieux de\r\nrassemblement par des signes visibles spéciaux qui seront notifiés\r\nd'avance à l'assiégeant.\r\n\r\nArticle 28.\r\n\r\nIl est interdit de livrer au pillage une ville ou localité même prise\r\nd'assaut.\r\n\r\nCHAPITRE II.--_Des

dans la zone d'opérations d'un belligérant,\r\navec l'intention de les communiquer à la partie adverse.\r\n\r\nAinsi les militaires non déguisés qui ont pénétré dans la zone\r\nd'opérations de l'armée ennemie, à l'effet de recueillir des\r\ninformations, ne sont pas considérés comme espions. De même, ne sont pas\r\nconsidérés comme espions: les militaires et les non militaires,\r\naccomplissant ouvertement leur mission, chargés de transmettre des\r\ndépêches destinées, soit à leur propre armée, soit à l'armée ennemie. A\r\ncette catégorie appartiennent également les individus envoyés en ballon\r\npour transmettre les dépêches, et, en général, pour entretenir les\r\ncommunications entre les diverses parties d'une armée ou d'un\r\nterritoire.\r\n\r\nArticle 30.\r\n\r\nL'espion pris sur le fait ne pourra être puni sans jugement préalable.\r\n\r\nArticle 31.\r\n\r\nL'espion qui, ayant rejoint l'armée à laquelle il appartient, est\r\ncapturé plus tard par l'ennemi, est traité comme prisonnier de guerre et\r\nn'encourt aucune responsabilité pour ses actes d'espionnage antérieurs.\r\n\r\nCHAPITRE III.--_Des parlementaires._\r\n\r\nArticle 32.\r\n\r\nEst considéré comme parlementaire l'individu autorisé par l'un des\r\nbelligérants à entrer en pourparlers avec l'autre et se présentant avec\r\nle drapeau blanc.

Il emporte, en\r\nquittant le navire, les objets et les instruments de chirurgie qui sont\r\nsa propriété particulière.\r\n\r\nCe personnel continuera à remplir ses fonctions tant que cela sera\r\nnécessaire et il pourra ensuite se retirer, lorsque le commandant en\r\nchef le jugera possible.\r\n\r\nLes belligérants doivent assurer à ce personnel tombé entre leurs mains,\r\nles mêmes allocations et la même solde qu'au personnel des mêmes grades\r\nde leur propre marine.\r\n\r\nArticle 11.\r\n\r\nLes marins et les militaires embarqués, et les autres personnes\r\nofficiellement attachées aux marines ou aux armées, blessés ou malades,\r\nà quelque nation qu'ils appartiennent, seront respectés et soignés par\r\nles capteurs.\r\n\r\nArticle 12.\r\n\r\nTout vaisseau de guerre d'une partie belligérante peut réclamer la\r\nremise des blessés, malades ou naufragés, qui sont à bord de\r\nbâtiments-hôpitaux militaires, de bâtiments hospitaliers de société de\r\nsecours ou de particuliers, de navires de commerce, yachts et\r\nembarcations, quelle que soit la nationalité de ces bâtiments.\r\n\r\nArticle 13.\r\n\r\nSi des blessés, malades ou naufragés sont recueillis à bord d'un\r\nvaisseau de guerre neutre, il devra être pourvu, dans la mesure du\r\npossible, à ce qu'ils ne puissent pas de nouveau prendre part aux\r\nopérations de la guerre.\r\n\r\nArticle 14.\r\n\r\nSont prisonniers de guerre les naufragés, blessés ou malades d'un\r\nbelligérant, qui tombent au pouvoir de l'autre. Il appartient à celui-ci\r\nde décider, suivant les circonstances, s'il convient de les garder, de\r\nles diriger sur un port de sa nation, sur un port neutre ou même sur un\r\nport de l'adversaire. Dans ce dernier cas, les prisonniers ainsi rendus\r\nà leur pays ne pourront servir pendant la durée de la guerre.\r\n\r\nArticle 15.\r\n\r\nLes naufragés, blessés ou malades, qui sont débarqués dans un port\r\nneutre, du consentement de l'autorité locale, devront, à moins d'un\r\narrangement contraire de l'État neutre avec les États belligérants, être\r\ngardés par l'État neutre de manière qu'ils ne puissent pas de nouveau\r\nprendre part aux opérations de la guerre.\r\n\r\nLes frais d'hospitalisation et d'internement seront supportés par l'État\r\ndont relèvent les naufragés, blessés ou malades.\r\n\r\nArticle 16.\r\n\r\nAprès chaque combat, les deux Parties belligérantes, en tant que les\r\nintérêts militaires le comportent, prendront des mesures pour rechercher\r\nles naufragés, les blessés et les malades et pour les faire protéger,\r\nainsi que les morts, contre le pillage et les mauvais traitements.\r\n\r\nElles veilleront à ce que l'inhumation, l'immersion ou l'incinération\r\ndes morts soit précédée d'un examen attentif de leurs cadavres.\r\n\r\nArticle 17.\r\n\r\nChaque belligérant enverra, dès qu'il sera possible, aux autorités de\r\nleur pays, de leur marine ou de leur armée, les marques ou pièces\r\nmilitaires d'identité trouvées sur les morts et l'état nominatif des\r\nblessés ou malades recueillis par lui.\r\n\r\nLes belligérants se tiendront réciproquement au courant des internements\r\net des mutations, ainsi que des entrées dans les hôpitaux et des décès\r\nsurvenus parmi les blessés et malades en leur pouvoir. Ils recueilleront\r\ntous les objets d'un usage personnel, valeurs, lettres, etc. qui seront\r\ntrouvés dans les vaisseaux capturés, ou délaissés par les blessés ou\r\nmalades décédés dans les hôpitaux, pour les faire transmettre aux\r\nintéressés par les autorités de leur pays.\r\n\r\nArticle 18.\r\n\r\nLes dispositions de la présente Convention ne sont applicables qu'entre\r\nles Puissances contractantes et seulement si les belligérants sont tous\r\nparties à la Convention.\r\n\r\nArticle 19.\r\n\r\nLes commandants en chef des flottes des belligérants auront à pourvoir\r\naux détails d'exécution des articles précédents, ainsi qu'aux cas non\r\nprévus, d'après les instructions de leurs Gouvernements respectifs et\r\nconformément aux principes généraux de la présente Convention.\r\n\r\nArticle 20.\r\n\r\nLes Puissances signataires prendront les mesures nécessaires pour\r\ninstruire leurs marines, et spécialement le personnel protégé, des\r\ndispositions de la présente Convention et pour les porter à la\r\nconnaissance des populations.\r\n\r\nArticle 21.\r\n\r\nLes Puissances signataires s'engagent également à prendre ou à proposer\r\nà leurs législatures, en cas d'insuffisance de leurs lois pénales, les\r\nmesures nécessaires pour réprimer en temps de guerre, les actes\r\nindividuels de pillage et de mauvais traitements envers des blessés et\r\nmalades des marines, ainsi que pour punir, comme usurpation d'insignes\r\nmilitaires, l'usage abusif des signes distinctifs désignés à l'article 5\r\npar des bâtiments non protégés par la présente Convention.\r\n\r\nIls se communiqueront, par l'intermédiaire du Gouvernement des Pays-Bas,\r\nles dispositions relatives à cette répression, au plus tard dans les\r\ncinq ans de la ratification de la présente convention.\r\n\r\nArticle 22.\r\n\r\nEn cas d'opérations de guerre entre les forces de terre et de mer des\r\nbelligérants, les dispositions de la présente Convention ne seront\r\napplicables qu'aux forces embarquées.\r\n\r\nArticle 23.\r\n\r\nLa présente Convention sera ratifiée aussitôt que possible.\r\n\r\nLes ratifications seront déposées à La Haye.\r\n\r\nLe premier dépôt de ratifications sera constaté par un procès-verbal\r\nsigné par les représentants des Puissances qui y prennent part et par le\r\nMinistre des Affaires Étrangères des Pays-Bas.\r\n\r\nLes dépôts ultérieurs de ratifications se feront au moyen d'une\r\nnotification écrite, adressée au Gouvernement des Pays-Bas et\r\naccompagnée de l'instrument de ratification.\r\n\r\nCopie certifiée conforme du procès-verbal relatif au premier dépôt de\r\nratifications, des notifications mentionnées à l'alinéa précédent, ainsi\r\nque des instruments de ratification, sera immédiatement remise par les\r\nsoins du Gouvernement des Pays-Bas et par la voie diplomatique aux\r\nPuissances conviées à la Deuxième Conférence de la Paix, ainsi qu'aux\r\nautres Puissances qui auront adhéré à la Convention. Dans les cas visés\r\npar l'alinéa précédent, ledit Gouvernement leur fera connaître en même\r\ntemps la date à laquelle il a reçu la notification.\r\n\r\nArticle 24.\r\n\r\nLes Puissances non signataires qui auront accepté la Convention de\r\nGenève du 6 juillet 1906, sont admises à adhérer à la présente\r\nConvention.\r\n\r\nLa Puissance qui désire adhérer, notifie par écrit son intention au\r\nGouvernement des Pays-Bas en lui transmettant l'acte d'adhésion qui sera\r\ndéposé dans les archives dudit Gouvernement.\r\n\r\nCe Gouvernement transmettra immédiatement à toutes les autres Puissances\r\ncopie certifiée conforme de la notification ainsi que de l'acte\r\nd'adhésion, en indiquant la date à laquelle il a reçu la notification.\r\n\r\nArticle 25.\r\n\r\nLa présente Convention, dûment ratifiée, remplacera dans les rapports\r\nentre les Puissances contractantes, la Convention du 29 juillet 1899\r\npour l'adaptation à la guerre maritime des principes de la Convention de\r\nGenève.\r\n\r\nLa Convention de 1899 reste en vigueur dans les rapports entre les\r\nPuissances qui l'ont signée et qui ne ratifieraient pas également la\r\nprésente Convention.\r\n\r\nArticle 26.\r\n\r\nLa présente Convention produira effet, pour les Puissances qui auront\r\nparticipé au premier dépôt de ratifications, soixante jours après la\r\ndate du procès-verbal de ce dépôt, et, pour les Puissances qui\r\nratifieront ultérieurement ou qui adhéreront, soixante jours après que\r\nla notification de leur ratification ou de leur adhésion aura été reçue\r\npar le Gouvernement des Pays-Bas.\r\n\r\nArticle 27.\r\n\r\nS'il arrivait qu'une des Puissances contractantes voulût dénoncer la\r\nprésente Convention, la dénonciation sera notifiée par écrit au\r\nGouvernement des Pays-Bas, qui communiquera immédiatement copie\r\ncertifiée conforme de la notification à toutes les autres Puissances en\r\nleur faisant savoir la date à laquelle il l'a reçue.\r\n\r\nLa dénonciation ne produira ses effets qu'à l'égard de la Puissance qui\r\nl'aura notifiée et un an après que la notification en sera parvenue au\r\nGouvernement des Pays-Bas.\r\n\r\nArticle 28.\r\n\r\nUn registre tenu par le Ministère des Affaires Étrangères des Pays-Bas\r\nindiquera la date du dépôt des ratifications effectué en vertu de\r\nl'article 23 alinéas 3 et 4, ainsi que la date à laquelle auront été\r\nreçues les notifications d'adhésion (article 24 alinéa 2) ou de\r\ndénonciation (article 27 alinéa 1).\r\n\r\nChaque Puissance contractante est admise à prendre connaissance de ce\r\nregistre et à en demander des extraits certifiés conformes.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONVENTION XI.\r\n\r\n      CONVENTION RELATIVE TO CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS ON THE EXERCISE OF\r\n      THE RIGHT OF CAPTURE IN MARITIME WAR.\r\n\r\nCHAPITRE I.--_De la Correspondance postale._\r\n\r\nArticle premier.\r\n\r\nLa correspondance postale des neutres ou des belligérants, quel que soit\r\nson caractère officiel ou privé, trouvée en mer sur un navire neutre ou\r\nennemi, est inviolable. S'il y a saisie du navire, elle est expédiée\r\navec le moins de retard possible par le capteur.\r\n\r\nLes dispositions de l'alinéa précédent ne s'appliquent pas, en cas de\r\nviolation de blocus, à la correspondance qui est à destination ou en\r\nprovenance du port bloqué.\r\n\r\nArticle 2.\r\n\r\nL'inviolabilité de la correspondance postale ne soustrait pas les\r\npaquebots-poste neutres aux lois et coutumes de la guerre sur mer\r\nconcernant les navires de commerce neutres en général. Toutefois, la\r\nvisite n'en doit être effectuée qu'en cas de nécessité, avec tous les\r\nménagements et toute la célérité possibles.\r\n\r\nCHAPITRE II.--_De l'exemption de capture pour certains bateaux._\r\n\r\nArticle 3.\r\n\r\nLes bateaux exclusivement affectés à la pêche côtière ou à des services\r\nde petite navigation locale sont exempts de capture, ainsi que leurs\r\nengins, agrès, apparaux et chargement.\r\n\r\nCette exemption cesse de leur être applicable dès qu'ils participent\r\nd'une façon quelconque aux hostilités.\r\n\r\nLes Puissances contractantes s'interdisent de profiter du caractère\r\ninoffensif desdits bateaux pour les employer dans un but militaire en\r\nleur conservant leur apparence pacifique.\r\n\r\nArticle 4.\r\n\r\nSont également exempts de capture les navires chargés de missions\r\nreligieuses, scientifiques ou philanthropiques.\r\n\r\nCHAPITRE III.--_Du régime des équipages des navires de commerce ennemis\r\ncapturés par un belligérant._\r\n\r\nArticle 5.\r\n\r\nLorsqu'un navire de commerce ennemi est capturé par un belligérant, les\r\nhommes de son équipage, nationaux d'un État neutre, ne sont pas faits\r\nprisonniers de guerre.\r\n\r\nIl en est de même du capitaine et des officiers, également nationaux\r\nd'un État neutre, s'ils promettent formellement par écrit de ne pas\r\nservir sur un navire ennemi pendant la durée de la guerre.\r\n\r\nArticle 6.\r\n\r\nLe capitaine, les officiers et les membres de l'équipage, nationaux de\r\nl'État ennemi, ne sont pas faits prisonniers de guerre, à condition\r\nqu'ils s'engagent, sous la foi d'une promesse formelle écrite, à ne\r\nprendre, pendant la durée des hostilités, aucun service ayant rapport\r\navec les opérations de la guerre.\r\n\r\nArticle 7.\r\n\r\nLes noms des individus laissés libres dans les conditions visées à\r\nl'article 5 alinéa 2 et à l'article 6, sont notifiés par le belligérant\r\ncapteur à l'autre belligérant. Il est interdit à ce dernier d'employer\r\nsciemment lesdits individus.\r\n\r\nArticle 8.\r\n\r\nLes dispositions des trois articles précédents ne s'appliquent pas aux\r\nnavires qui prennent part aux hostilités.\r\n\r\nCHAPITRE IV.--_Dispositions finales._\r\n\r\nArticle 9.\r\n\r\nLes dispositions de la présente Convention ne sont applicables qu'entre\r\nles Puissances contractantes et seulement si les belligérants sont tous\r\nParties à la Convention.\r\n\r\nArticle 10.\r\n\r\nLa présente Convention sera ratifiée aussitôt que possible.\r\n\r\nLes ratifications seront déposées à La Haye.\r\n\r\nLe premier dépôt de ratifications sera constaté par un procès-verbal\r\nsigné par les représentants des Puissances qui y prennent part et par le\r\nMinistre des Affaires Étrangères des Pays-Bas.\r\n\r\nLes dépôts ultérieurs de ratifications se feront au moyen d'une\r\nnotification écrite adressée au Gouvernement des Pays-Bas et accompagnée\r\nde l'instrument de ratification.\r\n\r\nCopie certifiée conforme du procès-verbal relatif au premier dépôt de\r\nratifications, des notifications mentionnées à l'alinéa précédent ainsi\r\nque des instruments de ratification, sera immédiatement remise par les\r\nsoins du Gouvernement des Pays-Bas et par la voie diplomatique aux\r\nPuissances conviées à la Deuxième Conférence de la Paix, ainsi qu'aux\r\nautres Puissances qui auront adhéré à la Convention.

signataires sont admises à adhérer à la présente\r\nConvention.\r\n\r\nLa Puissance qui désire adhérer notifie par écrit son intention au\r\nGouvernement des Pays-Bas en lui transmettant l'acte d'adhésion qui sera\r\ndéposé dans les archives dudit Gouvernement.\r\n\r\nCe Gouvernement transmettra immédiatement à toutes les autres Puissances\r\ncopie certifiée conforme de la notification ainsi que de l'acte\r\nd'adhésion, en indiquant la date à laquelle il a reçu la notification.\r\n\r\nArticle 12.\r\n\r\nLa présente Convention produira effet, pour les Puissances qui auront\r\nparticipé au

CONVENTION CONCERNING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN INTERNATIONAL\r\n      PRIZE COURT.\r\n\r\nTITRE I.--_Dispositions générales._\r\n\r\nArticle premier.\r\n\r\nLa validité de la capture d'un navire de commerce ou de sa cargaison\r\nest, s'il s'agit de propriétés neutres ou ennemies, établie devant une\r\njuridiction des prises conformément à la présente Convention.\r\n\r\nArticle 2.\r\n\r\nLa juridiction des prises est exercée d'abord par les tribunaux de\r\nprises du belligérant capteur.\r\n\r\nLes décisions de ces tribunaux sont prononcées en séance publique ou\r\nnotifiées d'office aux parties neutres ou ennemies.\r\n\r\nArticle 3.\r\n\r\nLes décisions des tribunaux de prises nationaux peuvent être l'objet\r\nd'un recours devant la Cour internationale des prises:\r\n\r\n1'o. lorsque la décision des tribunaux nationaux concerne les propriétés\r\nd'une Puissance ou d'un particulier neutres;\r\n\r\n2'o. lorsque ladite décision concerne des propriétés ennemies et qu'il\r\ns'agit:\r\n\r\n  (_a_) de marchandises chargées sur un navire neutre,\r\n\r\n  (_b_) d'un navire ennemi, qui aurait été capturé dans les eaux\r\n  territoriales d'une Puissance neutre, dans le cas où cette\r\n  Puissance n'aurait pas fait de cette capture l'objet d'une\r\n  réclamation diplomatique,\r\n\r\n  (_c_) d'une réclamation fondée sur l'allégation que la capture\r\n  aurait été effectuée en violation, soit d'une disposition\r\n  conventionnelle en vigueur entre les Puissances belligérantes,\r\n  soit d'une disposition légale édictée par le belligérant capteur.\r\n\r\nLe recours contre la décision des tribunaux nationaux peut être fondé\r\nsur ce que cette décision ne serait pas justifiée, soit en fait, soit en\r\ndroit.\r\n\r\nArticle 4.\r\n\r\nLe recours peut être exercé:\r\n\r\n  1'o. par une Puissance neutre, si la décision des tribunaux\r\n  nationaux a porté atteinte à ses propriétés ou à celles de ses\r\n  ressortissants (article 3--1'o) ou s'il est allégué que la capture\r\n  d'un navire ennemi a eu lieu dans les eaux territoriales de cette\r\n  Puissance (article 3--2'o _b_);\r\n\r\n  2'o. par un particulier neutre, si la décision des tribunaux\r\n  nationaux a porté atteinte à ses propriétés (article 3--1'o), sous\r\n  réserve toutefois du droit de la Puissance dont il relève, de lui\r\n  interdire l'accès de la Cour ou d'y agir elle-même en ses lieu et\r\n  place;\r\n\r\n  3'o. par un particulier relevant de la Puissance ennemie, si la\r\n  décision des tribunaux nationaux a porté atteinte à ses propriétés\r\n  dans les conditions visées à l'article 3--2'o, à l'exception du\r\n  cas prévu par l'alinéa _b_.\r\n\r\nArticle 5.\r\n\r\nLe recours peut aussi être exercé, dans les mêmes conditions qu'à\r\nl'article précédent, par les ayants-droit, neutres ou ennemis, du\r\nparticulier auquel le recours est accordé, et qui sont intervenus devant\r\nla juridiction nationale. Ces ayants-droit peuvent exercer\r\nindividuellement le recours dans la mesure de leur intérêt.\r\n\r\nIl en est de même des ayants-droit, neutres ou ennemis, de la Puissance\r\nneutre dont la propriété est en cause.\r\n\r\nArticle 6.\r\n\r\nLorsque, conformément à l'article 3 ci-dessus, la Cour internationale\r\nest compétente, le droit de juridiction des tribunaux nationaux ne peut\r\nêtre exercé à plus de deux degrés. Il appartient à la législation du\r\nbelligérant capteur de décider si le recours est ouvert après la\r\ndécision rendue en premier ressort ou seulement après la décision rendue\r\nen appel ou en cassation.\r\n\r\nFaute par les tribunaux nationaux d'avoir rendu une décision définitive\r\ndans les deux ans à compter du jour de la capture, la Cour peut être\r\nsaisie directement.\r\n\r\nArticle 7.\r\n\r\nSi la question de droit à résoudre est prévue par une Convention en\r\nvigueur entre le belligérant capteur et la Puissance qui est elle-même\r\npartie au litige ou dont le ressortissant est partie au litige, la Cour\r\nse conforme aux stipulations de ladite Convention.\r\n\r\nA défaut de telles stipulations, la Cour applique les règles du droit\r\ninternational. Si des règles généralement reconnues n'existent pas, la\r\nCour statue d'après les principes généraux de la justice et de l'équité.\r\n\r\nLes dispositions ci-dessus sont également applicables en ce qui concerne\r\nl'ordre des preuves ainsi que les moyens qui peuvent être employés.\r\n\r\nSi, conformément à l'article 3--2'o c, le recours est fondé sur la\r\nviolation d'une disposition légale édictée par le belligérant capteur,\r\nla Cour applique cette disposition.\r\n\r\nLa Cour peut ne pas tenir compte des déchéances de procédure édictées\r\npar la législation du belligérant capteur, dans les cas où elle estime\r\nque les conséquences en sont contraires à la justice et à l'équité.\r\n\r\nArticle 8.\r\n\r\nSi la Cour prononce la validité de la capture du navire ou de la\r\ncargaison, il en sera disposé conformément aux lois du belligérant\r\ncapteur.\r\n\r\nSi la nullité de la capture est prononcée, la Cour ordonne la\r\nrestitution du navire ou de la cargaison et fixe, s'il y a lieu, le\r\nmontant des dommages-intérêts. Si le navire ou la cargaison ont été\r\nvendus ou détruits, la Cour détermine l'indemnité à accorder de ce chef\r\nau propriétaire.\r\n\r\nSi la nullité de la capture avait été prononcée par la juridiction\r\nnationale, la Cour n'est appelée à statuer que sur les dommages et\r\nintérêts.\r\n\r\nArticle 9.\r\n\r\nLes Puissances contractantes s'engagent à se soumettre de bonne foi aux\r\ndécisions de la Cour internationale des prises et à les exécuter dans le\r\nplus bref délai possible.\r\n\r\nTITRE II.--_Organisation de la Cour internationale des prises._\r\n\r\nArticle 10.\r\n\r\nLa Cour internationale des prises se compose de juges et de juges\r\nsuppléants nommés par les Puissances contractantes et qui tous devront\r\nêtre des jurisconsultes d'une compétence reconnue dans les questions de\r\ndroit international maritime et jouissant de la plus haute considération\r\nmorale.\r\n\r\nLa nomination de ces juges et juges suppléants sera faite dans les six\r\nmois qui suivront la ratification de la présente Convention.\r\n\r\nArticle 11.\r\n\r\nLes juges et juges suppléants sont nommés pour une période de six ans, à\r\ncompter de la date où la notification de leur nomination aura été reçue\r\npar le Conseil administratif institué par la Convention pour le\r\nrèglement pacifique des conflits internationaux du 29 juillet 1899. Leur\r\nmandat peut être renouvelé.\r\n\r\nEn cas de décès ou de démission d'un juge ou d'un juge suppléant, il est\r\npourvu à son remplacement selon le mode fixé pour sa nomination. Dans ce\r\ncas, la nomination est faite pour une nouvelle période de six ans.\r\n\r\nArticle 12.\r\n\r\nLes juges de la Cour internationale des prises sont égaux entre eux et\r\nprennent rang d'après la date où la notification de leur nomination aura\r\nété reçue (article 11 alinéa 1), et, s'ils siègent à tour de rôle\r\n(article 15 alinéa 2), d'après la date de leur entrée en fonctions. La\r\npréséance appartient au plus âgé, au cas où la date est la même.\r\n\r\nLes juges suppléants sont, dans l'exercice de leurs fonctions, assimilés\r\naux juges titulaires. Toutefois ils prennent rang après ceux-ci.\r\n\r\nArticle 13.\r\n\r\nLes juges jouissent des privilèges et immunités diplomatiques dans\r\nl'exercice de leurs fonctions et en dehors de leur pays.\r\n\r\nAvant de prendre possession de leur siège, les juges doivent, devant le\r\nConseil administratif, prêter serment ou faire une affirmation\r\nsolennelle d'exercer leurs fonctions avec impartialité et en toute\r\nconscience.\r\n\r\nArticle 14.\r\n\r\nLa Cour fonctionne au nombre de quinze juges; neuf juges constituent le\r\nquorum nécessaire.\r\n\r\nLe juge absent ou empêché est remplacé par le suppléant.\r\n\r\nArticle 15.\r\n\r\nLes juges nommés par les Puissances contractantes dont les noms suivent:\r\nl'Allemagne, les États-Unis d'Amérique, l'Autriche-Hongrie, la France,\r\nla Grande-Bretagne, l'Italie, le Japon et la Russie sont toujours\r\nappelés à siéger.\r\n\r\nLes juges et les juges suppléants nommés par les autres Puissances\r\ncontractantes siègent à tour de rôle d'après le tableau annexé à la\r\nprésente Convention; leurs fonctions peuvent être exercées\r\nsuccessivement par la même personne. Le même juge peut être nommé par\r\nplusieurs desdites Puissances.\r\n\r\nArticle 16.\r\n\r\nSi une Puissance belligérante n'a pas, d'après le tour de rôle, un juge\r\nsiégeant dans la Cour, elle peut demander que le juge nommé par elle\r\nprenne part au jugement de toutes les affaires provenant de la guerre.\r\nDans ce cas, le sort détermine lequel des juges siégeant en vertu du\r\ntour de rôle doit s'abstenir. Cette exclusion ne saurait s'appliquer au\r\njuge nommé par l'autre belligérant.\r\n\r\nArticle 17.\r\n\r\nNe peut siéger le juge qui, à un titre quelconque, aura concouru à la\r\ndécision des tribunaux nationaux ou aura figuré dans l'instance comme\r\nconseil ou avocat d'une partie.\r\n\r\nAucun juge, titulaire ou suppléant, ne peut intervenir comme agent ou\r\ncomme avocat devant la Cour internationale des prises ni y agir pour une\r\npartie en quelque qualité que ce soit, pendant toute la durée de ses\r\nfonctions.\r\n\r\nArticle 18.\r\n\r\nLe belligérant capteur a le droit de désigner un officier de marine d'un\r\ngrade élevé qui siégera en qualité d'assesseur avec voix consultative.\r\nLa même faculté appartient à la Puissance neutre, qui est elle-même\r\npartie au litige, ou à la Puissance dont le ressortissant est partie au\r\nlitige; s'il y a, par application de cette dernière disposition,\r\nplusieurs Puissances intéressées, elles doivent se concerter, au besoin\r\npar le sort, sur l'officier à désigner.\r\n\r\nArticle 19.\r\n\r\nLa Cour élit son Président et son Vice-Président à la majorité absolue\r\ndes suffrages exprimés. Après deux tours de scrutin, l'élection se fait\r\nà la majorité relative et, en cas de partage des voix, le sort décide.\r\n\r\nArticle 20.\r\n\r\nLes juges de la Cour internationale des prises touchent une indemnité de\r\nvoyage fixée d'après les règlements de leur pays et reçoivent, en outre,\r\npendant la session ou pendant l'exercice de fonctions conférées par la\r\nCour, une somme de cent florins néerlandais par jour.\r\n\r\nCes allocations, comprises dans les frais généraux de la Cour prévus par\r\nl'article 47, sont versées par l'entremise du Bureau international\r\ninstitué par la Convention du 29 juillet 1899.\r\n\r\nLes juges ne peuvent recevoir de leur propre Gouvernement ou de celui\r\nd'une autre Puissance aucune rémunération comme membres de la Cour.\r\n\r\nArticle 21.\r\n\r\nLa Cour internationale des prises a son siège à La Haye et ne peut, sauf\r\nle cas de force majeure, le transporter ailleurs qu'avec l'assentiment\r\ndes parties belligérantes.\r\n\r\nArticle 22.\r\n\r\nLe Conseil administratif, dans lequel ne figurent que les représentants\r\ndes Puissances contractantes, remplit, à l'égard de la Cour\r\ninternationale des prises, les fonctions qu'il remplit à l'égard de la\r\nCour permanente d'arbitrage.\r\n\r\nArticle 23.\r\n\r\nLe Bureau international sert de greffe à la Cour internationale des\r\nprises et doit mettre ses locaux et son organisation à la disposition de\r\nla Cour. Il a la garde des archives et la gestion des affaires\r\nadministratives.\r\n\r\nLe secrétaire général du Bureau international remplit les fonctions de\r\ngreffier.\r\n\r\nLes secrétaires adjoints au greffier, les traducteurs et les\r\nsténographes nécessaires sont désignés et assermentés par la Cour.\r\n\r\nArticle 24.\r\n\r\nLa Cour décide du choix de la langue dont elle fera usage et des langues\r\ndont l'emploi sera autorisé devant elle.\r\n\r\nDans tous les cas, la langue officielle des tribunaux nationaux, qui ont\r\nconnu de l'affaire, peut être employée devant la Cour.\r\n\r\nArticle 25.\r\n\r\nLes Puissances intéressées ont le droit de nommer des agents spéciaux\r\nayant mission de servir d'intermédiaires entre Elles et la Cour. Elles\r\nsont, en outre, autorisées à charger des conseils ou avocats de la\r\ndéfense de leurs droits et intérêts.\r\n\r\nArticle 26.\r\n\r\nLe particulier intéressé sera représenté devant la Cour par un\r\nmandataire qui doit être soit un avocat autorisé à plaider devant une\r\nCour d'appel ou une Cour suprême de l'un des Pays contractants, soit un\r\navoué exerçant sa profession auprès d'une telle Cour, soit enfin un\r\nprofesseur de droit à une école d'enseignement supérieur d'un de ces\r\npays.\r\n\r\nArticle 27.\r\n\r\nPour toutes les notifications à faire, notamment aux parties, aux\r\ntémoins et aux experts, la Cour peut s'adresser directement au\r\nGouvernement de la Puissance sur le territoire de laquelle la\r\nnotification doit être effectuée. Il en est de même s'il s'agit de faire\r\nprocéder à l'établissement de tout moyen de preuve.\r\n\r\nLes requêtes adressées à cet effet seront exécutées suivant les moyens\r\ndont la Puissance requise dispose d'après sa législation intérieure.\r\nElles ne peuvent être refusées que si cette Puissance les juge de\r\nnature à porter atteinte à sa souveraineté ou à sa sécurité. S'il est\r\ndonné suite à la requête, les frais ne comprennent que les dépenses\r\nd'exécution réellement effectuées.\r\n\r\nLa Cour a également la faculté de recourir à l'intermédiaire de la\r\nPuissance sur le territoire de laquelle elle a son siège.\r\n\r\nLes notifications à faire aux parties dans le lieu où siège la Cour\r\npeuvent être exécutées par le Bureau international.\r\n\r\nTITRE III.--_Procédure devant la Cour internationale des prises._\r\n\r\nArticle 28.\r\n\r\nLe recours devant la Cour internationale des prises est formé au moyen\r\nd'une déclaration écrite, faite devant le tribunal national qui a\r\nstatué, ou adressée au Bureau international; celui-ci peut être saisi\r\nmême par télégramme.\r\n\r\nLe délai du recours est fixé à cent vingt jours à dater du jour où la\r\ndécision a été prononcée ou notifiée (article 2 alinéa 2).\r\n\r\nArticle 29.\r\n\r\nSi la déclaration de recours est faite devant le tribunal national,\r\ncelui-ci, sans examiner si le délai a été observé, fait, dans les sept\r\njours qui suivent, expédier le dossier de l'affaire au Bureau\r\ninternational.\r\n\r\nSi la déclaration de recours est adressée au Bureau international,\r\ncelui-ci en prévient directement le tribunal national, par télégramme\r\ns'il est possible. Le tribunal transmettra le dossier comme il est dit à\r\nl'alinéa précédent.\r\n\r\nLorsque le recours est formé par un particulier neutre, le Bureau\r\ninternational en avise immédiatement par télégramme la Puissance dont\r\nrelève le particulier, pour permettre à cette Puissance de faire valoir\r\nle droit que lui reconnaît l'article 4--2'o.\r\n\r\nArticle 30.\r\n\r\nDans le cas prévu à l'article 6 alinéa 2, le recours ne peut être\r\nadressé qu'au Bureau international. Il doit être introduit dans les\r\ntrente jours qui suivent l'expiration du délai de deux ans.\r\n\r\nArticle 31.\r\n\r\nFaute d'avoir formé son recours dans le délai fixé à l'article 28 ou à\r\nl'article 30, la partie sera, sans débats, déclarée non recevable.\r\n\r\nToutefois, si elle justifie d'un empêchement de force majeure et si\r\nelle a formé son recours dans les soixante jours qui ont suivi la\r\ncessation de cet empêchement, elle peut être relevée de la déchéance\r\nencourue, la partie adverse ayant été dûment entendue.\r\n\r\nArticle 32.\r\n\r\nSi le recours a été formé en temps utile, la Cour notifie d'office et\r\nsans délai à la partie adverse une copie certifiée conforme de la\r\ndéclaration.\r\n\r\nArticle 33.\r\n\r\nSi, en dehors des parties qui se sont pourvues devant la Cour, il y a\r\nd'autres intéressés ayant le droit d'exercer le recours, ou si, dans le\r\ncas prévu à l'article 29 alinéa 3, la Puissance qui a été avisée, n'a\r\npas fait connaître sa résolution, la Cour attend, pour se saisir de\r\nl'affaire, que les délais prévus à l'article 28 ou à l'article 30 soient\r\nexpirés.\r\n\r\nArticle 34.\r\n\r\nLa procédure devant la Cour internationale comprend deux phases\r\ndistinctes: l'instruction écrite et les débats oraux.\r\n\r\nL'instruction écrite consiste dans le dépôt et l'échange d'exposés, de\r\ncontre-exposés et, au besoin, de répliques dont l'ordre et les délais\r\nsont fixés par la Cour. Les parties y joignent toutes pièces et\r\ndocuments dont elles comptent se servir.\r\n\r\nToute pièce, produite par une partie, doit être communiquée en copie\r\ncertifiée conforme à l'autre partie par l'intermédiaire de la Cour.\r\n\r\nArticle 35.\r\n\r\nL'instruction écrite étant terminée, il y a lieu à une audience\r\npublique, dont le jour est fixé par la Cour.\r\n\r\nDans cette audience, les parties exposent l'état de l'affaire en fait et\r\nen droit.\r\n\r\nLa Cour peut, en tout état de cause, suspendre les plaidoiries, soit à\r\nla demande d'une des parties, soit d'office, pour procéder à une\r\ninformation complémentaire.\r\n\r\nArticle 36.\r\n\r\nLa Cour internationale peut ordonner que l'information complémentaire\r\naura lieu, soit conformément aux dispositions de l'article 27, soit\r\ndirectement devant elle ou devant un ou plusieurs de ses membres en tant\r\nque cela peut se faire sans moyen coercitif ou comminatoire.\r\n\r\nSi des mesures d'information doivent être prises par des membres de la\r\nCour en dehors du territoire où elle a son siège, l'assentiment du\r\nGouvernement étranger doit être obtenu.\r\n\r\nArticle 37.\r\n\r\nLes parties sont appelées à assister à toutes mesures d'instruction.\r\nElles reçoivent une copie certifiée conforme des procès-verbaux.\r\n\r\nArticle 38.\r\n\r\nLes débats sont dirigés par le Président ou le Vice-Président et, en cas\r\nd'absence ou d'empêchement de l'un et de l'autre, par le plus ancien des\r\njuges présents.\r\n\r\nLe juge nommé par une partie belligérante ne peut siéger comme\r\nPrésident.\r\n\r\nArticle 39.\r\n\r\nLes débats sont publics sauf le droit pour une Puissance en litige de\r\ndemander qu'il y soit procédé à huis clos.\r\n\r\nIls sont consignés dans des procès-verbaux, que signent le Président et\r\nle greffier et qui seuls ont caractère authentique.\r\n\r\nArticle 40.\r\n\r\nEn cas de non comparution d'une des parties, bien que régulièrement\r\ncitée, ou faute par elle d'agir dans les délais fixés par la Cour, il\r\nest procédé sans elle et la Cour décide d'après les éléments\r\nd'appréciation qu'elle a à sa disposition.\r\n\r\nArticle 41.\r\n\r\nLa Cour notifie d'office aux parties toutes décisions ou ordonnances\r\nprises en leur absence.\r\n\r\nArticle 42.\r\n\r\nLa Cour apprécie librement l'ensemble des actes, preuves et déclarations\r\norales.\r\n\r\nArticle 43.\r\n\r\nLes délibérations de la Cour ont lieu à huis clos et restent secrètes.\r\n\r\nToute décision est prise à la majorité des juges présents. Si la Cour\r\nsiège en nombre pair et qu'il y ait partage des voix, la voix du dernier\r\ndes juges dans l'ordre de préséance établi d'après l'article 12 alinéa 1\r\nn'est pas comptée.\r\n\r\nArticle 44.\r\n\r\nL'arrêt de la Cour doit être motivé. Il mentionne les noms des juges qui\r\ny ont participé, ainsi que les noms des assesseurs, s'il y a lieu; il\r\nest signé par le Président et par le greffier.\r\n\r\nArticle 45.\r\n\r\nL'arrêt est prononcé en séance publique, les parties présentes ou dûment\r\nappelées; il est notifié d'office aux parties.\r\n\r\nCette notification une fois faite, la Cour fait parvenir au tribunal\r\nnational des prises le dossier de l'affaire en y joignant une expédition\r\ndes diverses décisions intervenues ainsi qu'une copie des procès-verbaux\r\nde l'instruction.\r\n\r\nArticle 46.\r\n\r\nChaque partie supporte les frais occasionnés par sa propre défense.\r\n\r\nLa partie qui succombe supporte, en outre, les frais causés par la\r\nprocédure. Elle doit, de plus, verser un centième de la valeur de\r\nl'objet litigieux à titre de contribution aux frais généraux de la Cour\r\ninternationale. Le montant de ces versements est déterminé par l'arrêt\r\nde la Cour.\r\n\r\nSi le recours est exercé par un particulier, celui-ci fournit au Bureau\r\ninternational un cautionnement dont le montant est fixé par la Cour et\r\nqui est destiné à garantir l'exécution éventuelle des deux obligations\r\nmentionnées dans l'alinéa précédent. La Cour peut subordonner\r\nl'ouverture de la procédure au versement du cautionnement.\r\n\r\nArticle 47.\r\n\r\nLes frais généraux de la Cour internationale des prises sont supportés\r\npar les Puissances contractantes dans la proportion de leur\r\nparticipation au fonctionnement de la Cour telle qu'elle est prévue par\r\nl'article 15 et par le tableau y annexé. La désignation des juges\r\nsuppléants ne donne pas lieu à contribution.\r\n\r\nLe Conseil administratif s'adresse aux Puissances pour obtenir les fonds\r\nnécessaires au fonctionnement de la Cour.\r\n\r\nArticle 48.\r\n\r\nQuand la Cour n'est pas en session, les fonctions qui lui sont conférées\r\npar l'article 32, l'article 34 alinéas 2 et 3, l'article 35 alinéa 1 et\r\nl'article 46 alinéa 3, sont exercées par une Délégation de trois juges\r\ndésignés par la Cour. Cette Délégation décide à la majorité des voix.\r\n\r\nArticle 49.\r\n\r\nLa Cour fait elle-même son règlement d'ordre intérieur qui doit être\r\ncommuniqué aux Puissances contractantes.\r\n\r\nDans l'année de la ratification de la présente Convention, elle se\r\nréunira pour élaborer ce règlement.\r\n\r\nArticle 50.\r\n\r\nLa Cour peut proposer des modifications à apporter aux dispositions de\r\nla présente Convention qui concernent la procédure. Ces propositions\r\nsont communiquées, par l'intermédiaire du Gouvernement des Pays-Bas,\r\naux Puissances contractantes qui se concerteront sur la suite à y\r\ndonner.\r\n\r\nTITRE IV.--_Dispositions finales._\r\n\r\nArticle 51.\r\n\r\nLa présente Convention ne s'applique de plein droit que si les\r\nPuissances belligérantes sont toutes parties à la Convention.\r\n\r\nIl est entendu, en outre, que le recours devant la Cour internationale\r\ndes prises ne peut être exercé que par une Puissance contractante ou le\r\nressortissant d'une Puissance contractante.\r\n\r\nDans les cas de l'article 5, le recours n'est admis que si le\r\npropriétaire et l'ayant-droit sont également des Puissances\r\ncontractantes ou des ressortissants de Puissances contractantes.\r\n\r\nArticle 52.\r\n\r\nLa présente Convention sera ratifiée et les ratifications en seront\r\ndéposées à La Haye dès que toutes les Puissances désignées à l'article\r\n15 et dans son annexe seront en mesure de le faire.\r\n\r\nLe dépôt des ratifications aura lieu en tout cas, le 30 juin 1909, si\r\nles Puissances prêtes à ratifier peuvent fournir à la Cour neuf juges et\r\nneuf juges suppléants, aptes à siéger effectivement. Dans le cas\r\ncontraire, le dépôt sera ajourné jusqu'au moment où cette condition sera\r\nremplie.\r\n\r\nIl sera dressé du dépôt des ratifications un procès-verbal dont une\r\ncopie, certifiée conforme, sera remise par la voie diplomatique à\r\nchacune des Puissances désignées à l'alinéa premier.\r\n\r\nArticle 53.\r\n\r\nLes Puissances désignées à l'article 15 et dans son annexe sont admises\r\nà signer la présente Convention jusqu'au dépôt des ratifications prévu\r\npar l'alinéa 2 de l'article précédent.\r\n\r\nAprès ce dépôt, elles seront toujours admises à y adhérer, purement et\r\nsimplement. La Puissance qui désire adhérer notifie par écrit son\r\nintention au Gouvernement des Pays-Bas en lui transmettant, en même\r\ntemps, l'acte d'adhésion qui sera déposé dans les archives dudit\r\nGouvernement. Celui-ci enverra, par la voie diplomatique, une copie\r\ncertifiée conforme de la notification et de l'acte d'adhésion à toutes\r\nles Puissances désignées à l'alinéa précédent, en leur faisant savoir la\r\ndate où il a reçu la notification.\r\n\r\nArticle 54.\r\n\r\nLa présente Convention entrera en vigueur six mois à partir du dépôt\r\ndes ratifications prévu par l'article 52 alinéas 1 et 2.\r\n\r\nLes adhésions produiront effet soixante jours après que la notification\r\nen aura été reçue par le Gouvernement des Pays-Bas et, au plus tôt, à\r\nl'expiration du délai prévu par l'alinéa précédent.\r\n\r\nToutefois, la Cour internationale aura qualité pour juger les affaires\r\nde prises décidées par la juridiction nationale à partir du dépôt des\r\nratifications ou de la réception de la notification des adhésions. Pour\r\nces décisions, le délai fixé à l'article 28 alinéa 2, ne sera compté que\r\nde la date de la mise en vigueur de la Convention pour les Puissances\r\nayant ratifié ou adhéré.\r\n\r\nArticle 55.\r\n\r\nLa présente Convention aura une durée de douze ans à partir de sa mise\r\nen vigueur, telle qu'elle est déterminée par l'article 54 alinéa 1, même\r\npour les Puissances ayant adhéré postérieurement.\r\n\r\nElle sera renouvelée tacitement de six ans en six ans sauf dénonciation.\r\n\r\nLa dénonciation devra être, au moins un an avant l'expiration de chacune\r\ndes périodes prévues par les deux alinéas précédents, notifiée par écrit\r\nau Gouvernement des Pays-Bas qui en donnera connaissance à toutes les\r\nautres Parties contractantes.\r\n\r\nLa dénonciation ne produira ses effets qu'à l'égard de la Puissance qui\r\nl'aura notifiée. La Convention subsistera pour les autres Puissances\r\ncontractantes, pourvu que leur participation à la désignation des juges\r\nsoit suffisante pour permettre le fonctionnement de la Cour avec neuf\r\njuges et neuf juges suppléants.\r\n\r\nArticle 56.\r\n\r\nDans le cas où la présente Convention n'est pas en vigueur pour toutes\r\nles Puissances désignées dans l'article 15 et le tableau qui s'y\r\nrattache, le Conseil administratif dresse, conformément aux dispositions\r\nde cet article et de ce tableau, la liste des juges et des juges\r\nsuppléants pour lesquels les Puissances contractantes participent au\r\nfonctionnement de la Cour. Les juges appelés à siéger à tour de rôle\r\nseront, pour le temps qui leur est attribué par le tableau susmentionné,\r\nrépartis entre les différentes années de la période de six ans, de\r\nmanière que, dans la mesure du possible, la Cour fonctionne chaque année\r\nen nombre égal. Si le nombre des juges suppléants dépasse celui des\r\njuges, le nombre de ces derniers pourra être complété par des juges\r\nsuppléants désignés par le sort parmi celles des Puissances qui ne\r\nnomment pas de juge titulaire.\r\n\r\nLa liste ainsi dressée par le Conseil administratif sera notifiée aux\r\nPuissances contractantes. Elle sera révisée quand le nombre de celles-ci\r\nsera modifié par suite d'adhésions ou de dénonciations.\r\n\r\nLe changement à opérer par suite d'une adhésion ne se produira qu'à\r\npartir du 1'er janvier qui suit la date à laquelle l'adhésion a son\r\neffet, à moins que la Puissance adhérente ne soit une Puissance\r\nbelligérante, cas auquel elle peut demander d'être aussitôt représentée\r\ndans la Cour, la disposition de l'article 16 étant du reste applicable,\r\ns'il y a lieu.\r\n\r\nQuand le nombre total des juges est inférieur à onze, sept juges\r\nconstituent le quorum nécessaire.\r\n\r\nArticle 57.\r\n\r\nDeux ans avant l'expiration de chaque période visée par les alinéas 1 et\r\n2 de l'article 55, chaque Puissance contractante pourra demander une\r\nmodification des dispositions de l'article 15 et du tableau y annexé,\r\nrelativement à sa participation au fonctionnement de la Cour. La demande\r\nsera adressée au Conseil administratif qui l'examinera et soumettra à\r\ntoutes les Puissances des propositions sur la suite à y donner.

Il est aussi tenu d'user de la même surveillance pour\r\nempêcher le départ hors de sa juridiction de tout navire destiné à\r\ncroiser ou à concourir à des opérations hostiles, et qui aurait été,\r\ndans ladite juridiction, adapté en tout ou en partie à des usages de\r\nguerre.\r\n\r\nArticle 9.\r\n\r\nUne Puissance neutre doit appliquer également aux deux belligérants les\r\nconditions, restrictions ou interdictions, édictées par elle pour ce qui\r\nconcerne l'admission dans ses ports, rades ou eaux territoriales, des\r\nnavires de guerre belligérants ou de leurs prises.\r\n\r\nToutefois, une Puissance neutre peut interdire l'accès de ses ports et\r\nde ses rades au navire belligérant qui aurait négligé de se conformer\r\naux ordres et prescriptions édictés par elle ou qui aurait violé la\r\nneutralité.\r\n\r\nArticle 10.\r\n\r\nLa neutralité d'une Puissance n'est pas compromise par le simple passage\r\ndans ses eaux territoriales de navires de guerre et des prises des\r\nbelligérants.\r\n\r\nArticle 11.\r\n\r\nUne Puissance neutre peut laisser les navires de guerre des belligérants\r\nse servir de ses pilotes brevetés.\r\n\r\nArticle 12.\r\n\r\nA défaut d'autres dispositions spéciales de la législation de la\r\nPuissance neutre, il est interdit aux navires de guerre des belligérants\r\nde demeurer dans les ports et rades ou dans les eaux territoriales de\r\nladite Puissance, pendant plus de 24 heures, sauf dans les cas prévus\r\npar la présente Convention.\r\n\r\nArticle 13.\r\n\r\nSi une Puissance avisée de l'ouverture des hostilités apprend qu'un\r\nnavire de guerre d'un belligérant se trouve dans un de ses ports et\r\nrades ou dans ses eaux territoriales, elle doit notifier audit navire\r\nqu'il devra partir dans les 24 heures ou dans le délai prescrit par la\r\nloi locale.\r\n\r\nArticle 14.\r\n\r\nUn navire de guerre belligérant ne peut prolonger son séjour dans un\r\nport neutre au delà de la durée légale que pour cause d'avaries ou à\r\nraison de l'état de la mer. Il devra partir dès que la cause du retard\r\naura cessé.\r\n\r\nLes règles sur la limitation du séjour dans les ports, rades et eaux\r\nneutres, ne s'appliquent pas aux navires de guerre exclusivement\r\naffectés à une mission religieuse, scientifique ou philanthropique.\r\n\r\nArticle 15.\r\n\r\nA défaut d'autres dispositions spéciales de la législation de la\r\nPuissance neutre, le nombre maximum des navires de guerre d'un\r\nbelligérant qui pourront se trouver en même temps dans un de ses ports\r\nou rades, sera de trois.\r\n\r\nArticle 16.\r\n\r\nLorsque des navires de guerre des deux parties belligérantes se trouvent\r\nsimultanément dans un port ou une rade neutres, il doit s'écouler au\r\nmoins 24 heures entre le départ du navire d'un belligérant et le départ\r\ndu navire de l'autre.\r\n\r\nL'ordre des départs est déterminé par l'ordre des arrivées, à moins que\r\nle navire arrivé le premier ne soit dans le cas où la prolongation de la\r\ndurée légale du séjour est admise.\r\n\r\nUn navire de guerre belligérant ne peut quitter un port ou une rade\r\nneutres moins de 24 heures après le départ d'un navire de commerce\r\nportant le pavillon de son adversaire.\r\n\r\nArticle 17.\r\n\r\nDans les ports et rades neutres, les navires de guerre belligérants ne\r\npeuvent réparer leurs avaries que dans la mesure indispensable à la\r\nsécurité de leur navigation et non pas accroître, d'une manière\r\nquelconque, leur force militaire. L'autorité neutre constatera la nature\r\ndes réparations à effectuer qui devront être exécutées le plus\r\nrapidement possible.\r\n\r\nArticle 18.\r\n\r\nLes navires de guerre belligérants ne peuvent pas se servir des ports,\r\nrades et eaux territoriales neutres, pour renouveler ou augmenter leurs\r\napprovisionnements militaires ou leur armement ainsi que pour compléter\r\nleurs équipages.\r\n\r\nArticle 19.\r\n\r\nLes navires de guerre belligérants ne peuvent se ravitailler dans les\r\nports et rades neutres que pour compléter leur approvisionnement normal\r\ndu temps de paix.\r\n\r\nCes navires ne peuvent, de même, prendre du combustible que pour gagner\r\nle port le plus proche de leur propre pays. Ils peuvent, d'ailleurs,\r\nprendre le combustible nécessaire pour compléter le plein de leurs\r\nsoutes proprement dites, quand ils se trouvent dans les pays neutres qui\r\nont adopté ce mode de détermination du combustible à fournir.\r\n\r\nSi, d'après la loi de la Puissance neutre, les navires ne reçoivent du\r\ncharbon que 24 heures après leur arrivée, la durée légale de leur séjour\r\nest prolongée de 24 heures.\r\n\r\nArticle 20.\r\n\r\nLes navires de guerre belligérants, qui ont pris du combustible dans le\r\nport d'une Puissance neutre, ne peuvent renouveler leur\r\napprovisionnement qu'après trois mois dans un port de la même Puissance.\r\n\r\nArticle 21.\r\n\r\nUne prise ne peut être amenée dans un port neutre que pour cause\r\nd'innavigabilité, de mauvais état de la mer, de manque de combustible\r\nou de provisions.\r\n\r\nElle doit repartir aussitôt que la cause qui en a justifié l'entrée a\r\ncessé. Si elle ne le fait pas, la Puissance neutre doit lui notifier\r\nl'ordre de partir immédiatement; au cas où elle ne s'y conformerait pas,\r\nla Puissance neutre doit user des moyens dont elle dispose pour la\r\nrelâcher avec ses officiers et son équipage et interner l'équipage mis à\r\nbord par le capteur.\r\n\r\nArticle 22.\r\n\r\nLa Puissance neutre doit, de même, relâcher la prise qui aurait été\r\namenée en dehors des conditions prévues par l'article 21.\r\n\r\nArticle 23.\r\n\r\nUne Puissance neutre peut permettre l'accès de ses ports et rades aux\r\nprises escortées ou non, lorsqu'elles y sont amenées pour être laissées\r\nsous séquestre en attendant la décision du tribunal des prises. Elle\r\npeut faire conduire la prise dans un autre de ses ports.\r\n\r\nSi la prise est escortée par un navire de guerre, les officiers et les\r\nhommes mis à bord par le capteur sont autorisés à passer sur le navire\r\nd'escorte.\r\n\r\nSi la prise voyage seule, le personnel placé à son bord par le capteur\r\nest laissé en liberté.\r\n\r\nArticle 24.\r\n\r\nSi, malgré la notification de l'autorité neutre, un navire de guerre\r\nbelligérant ne quitte pas un port dans lequel il n'a pas le droit de\r\nrester, la Puissance neutre a le droit de prendre les mesures qu'elle\r\npourra juger nécessaires pour rendre le navire incapable de prendre la\r\nmer pendant la durée de la guerre et le commandant du navire doit\r\nfaciliter l'exécution de ces mesures.\r\n\r\nLorsqu'un navire belligérant est retenu par une Puissance neutre, les\r\nofficiers et l'équipage sont également retenus.\r\n\r\nLes officiers et l'équipage ainsi retenus peuvent être laissés dans le\r\nnavire ou logés, soit sur un autre navire, soit à terre, et ils peuvent\r\nêtre assujettis aux mesures restrictives qu'il paraîtrait nécessaire de\r\nleur imposer. Toutefois, on devra toujours laisser sur le navire les\r\nhommes nécessaires à son entretien.\r\n\r\nLes officiers peuvent être laissés libres en prenant l'engagement sur\r\nparole de ne pas quitter le territoire neutre sans autorisation.\r\n\r\nArticle 25.\r\n\r\nUne Puissance neutre est tenue d'exercer la surveillance, que\r\ncomportent les moyens dont elle dispose, pour empêcher dans ses ports\r\nou rades et dans ses eaux toute violation des dispositions qui\r\nprécèdent.\r\n\r\nArticle 26.\r\n\r\nL'exercice par une Puissance neutre des droits définis par la présente\r\nConvention ne peut jamais être considéré comme un acte peu amical par\r\nl'un ou par l'autre belligérant qui a accepté les articles qui s'y\r\nréfèrent.\r\n\r\nArticle 27.\r\n\r\nLes Puissances contractantes se communiqueront réciproquement, en temps\r\nutile, toutes les lois, ordonnances et autres dispositions réglant chez\r\nelles le régime des navires de guerre belligérants dans leurs ports et\r\nleurs eaux, au moyen d'une notification adressée au Gouvernement des\r\nPays-Bas et transmise immédiatement par celui-ci aux autres Puissances\r\ncontractantes.\r\n\r\nArticle 28.\r\n\r\nLes dispositions de la présente Convention ne sont applicables qu'entre\r\nles Puissances contractantes et seulement si les belligérants sont tous\r\nparties à la Convention.\r\n\r\nArticle 29.\r\n\r\nLa présente Convention sera ratifiée aussitôt que possible.\r\n\r\nLes ratifications seront déposées à La Haye.\r\n\r\nLe premier dépôt de ratifications sera constaté par un procès-verbal\r\nsigné par les représentants des Puissances qui y prennent part et par le\r\nMinistre des Affaires Étrangères des Pays-Bas.\r\n\r\nLes dépôts ultérieurs de ratifications se feront au moyen d'une\r\nnotification écrite, adressée au Gouvernement des Pays-Bas et\r\naccompagnée de l'instrument de ratification.\r\n\r\nCopie certifiée conforme du procès-verbal relatif au premier dépôt de\r\nratifications, des notifications mentionnées à l'alinéa précédent, ainsi\r\nque des instruments de ratification, sera immédiatement remise par les\r\nsoins du Gouvernement des Pays-Bas et par la voie diplomatique aux\r\nPuissances conviées à la Deuxième Conférence de la Paix, ainsi qu'aux\r\nautres Puissances qui auront adhéré à la Convention. Dans les cas visés\r\npar l'alinéa précédent, ledit Gouvernement leur fera connaître en même\r\ntemps la date à laquelle il a reçu la notification.\r\n\r\nArticle 30.\r\n\r\nLes Puissances non signataires sont admises à adhérer à la présente\r\nConvention.\r\n\r\nLa Puissance qui désire adhérer notifie par écrit son intention au\r\nGouvernement des Pays-Bas en lui transmettant l'acte d'adhésion qui sera\r\ndéposé dans les archives dudit Gouvernement.\r\n\r\nCe Gouvernement transmettra immédiatement à toutes les autres Puissances\r\ncopie certifiée conforme de la notification ainsi que de l'acte\r\nd'adhésion, en indiquant la date à laquelle il a reçu la notification.\r\n\r\nArticle 31.\r\n\r\nLa présente Convention produira effet pour les Puissances qui auront\r\nparticipé au premier dépôt des ratifications, soixante jours après la\r\ndate du procès-verbal de ce dépôt et, pour les Puissances qui\r\nratifieront ultérieurement ou qui adhéreront, soixante jours après que\r\nla notification de leur ratification ou de leur adhésion aura été reçue\r\npar la Gouvernement des Pays-Bas.\r\n\r\nArticle 32.\r\n\r\nS'il arrivait qu'une des Puissances contractantes voulût dénoncer la\r\nprésente Convention, la dénonciation sera notifiée par écrit au\r\nGouvernement des Pays-Bas qui communiquera immédiatement copie certifiée\r\nconforme de la notification à toutes les autres Puissances en leur\r\nfaisant savoir la date à laquelle il l'a reçue.\r\n\r\nLa dénonciation ne produira ses effets qu'à l'égard de la Puissance qui\r\nl'aura notifiée et un an après que la notification en sera parvenue au\r\nGouvernement des Pays-Bas.\r\n\r\nArticle 33.\r\n\r\nUn registre tenu par le Ministère des Affaires Étrangères des Pays-Bas\r\nindiquera la date du dépôt de ratifications effectué en vertu de\r\nl'article 29 alinéas 3 et 4, ainsi que la date à laquelle auront été\r\nreçues les notifications d'adhésion (article 30 alinéa 2) ou de\r\ndénonciation (article 32 alinéa 1).\r\n\r\nChaque Puissance contractante est admise à prendre connaissance de ce\r\nregistre et à en demander des extraits certifiés conformes.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV.\r\n\r\n      DECLARATION CONCERNING THE PROHIBITION OF THE DISCHARGE OF\r\n      PROJECTILES AND EXPLOSIVES FROM BALLOONS.\r\n\r\nLes soussignés, Plénipotentiaires des Puissances conviées à la Deuxième\r\nConférence Internationale de la Paix à La Haye, dûment autorisés à cet\r\neffet par leurs Gouvernements,\r\n\r\ns'inspirant des sentiments qui ont trouvé leur expression dans la\r\nDéclaration de St. Pétersbourg du 29 novembre/11 décembre 1868, et\r\ndésirant renouveler la déclaration de La Haye du 29 juillet 1899,\r\narrivée à expiration,\r\n\r\nDéclarent:\r\n\r\nLes Puissances contractantes consentent, pour une période allant jusqu'à\r\nla fin de la troisième Conférence de la Paix, à l'interdiction de lancer\r\ndes projectiles et des explosifs du haut de ballons ou par d'autres\r\nmodes analogues nouveaux.\r\n\r\nLa présente Déclaration n'est obligatoire que pour les Puissances\r\ncontractantes, en cas de guerre entre deux ou plusieurs d'entre elles.\r\n\r\nElle cessera d'être obligatoire du moment où, dans une guerre entre des\r\nPuissances contractantes, une Puissance non contractante se joindrait à\r\nl'un des belligérants.\r\n\r\nLa présente Déclaration sera ratifiée dans le plus bref délai possible.\r\n\r\nLes ratifications seront déposées à La Haye.\r\n\r\nIl sera dressé du dépôt des ratifications un procès-verbal, dont une\r\ncopie, certifiée conforme, sera remise par la voie diplomatique à toutes\r\nles Puissances contractantes.\r\n\r\nLes Puissances non signataires pourront adhérer à la présente\r\nDéclaration. Elles auront, à cet effet, à faire connaître leur adhésion\r\naux Puissances contractantes, au moyen d'une notification écrite,\r\nadressée au Gouvernement des Pays-Bas et communiquée par celui-ci à\r\ntoutes les autres Puissances contractantes.\r\n\r\nS'il arrivait qu'une des Hautes Parties Contractantes dénonçât la\r\nprésente Déclaration, cette dénonciation ne produirait ses effets qu'un\r\nan après la notification faite par écrit au Gouvernement des Pays-Bas et\r\ncommuniquée immédiatement par celui-ci à toutes les autres Puissances\r\ncontractantes.\r\n\r\nCette dénonciation ne produira ses effets qu'à l'égard de la Puissance\r\nqui l'aura notifiée.\r\n\r\n\r\nANNEX TO THE FIRST VOEU OF THE SECOND PEACE CONFERENCE\r\n\r\nXV.\r\n\r\n      DRAFT CONVENTION CONCERNING THE CREATION OF A JUDICIAL\r\n      ARBITRATION COURT.\r\n\r\nTITRE I.--_Organisation de la Cour de justice arbitrale._\r\n\r\nArticle premier.\r\n\r\nDans le but de faire progresser la cause de l'arbitrage, les Puissances\r\ncontractantes conviennent d'organiser, sans porter atteinte à la Cour\r\npermanente d'arbitrage, une Cour de justice arbitrale, d'un accès libre\r\net facile, basée sur l'égalité juridique des États, réunissant des juges\r\nreprésentant les divers systèmes juridiques du monde, et capable\r\nd'assurer la continuité de la jurisprudence arbitrale.\r\n\r\nArticle 2.\r\n\r\nLa Cour de justice arbitrale se compose de juges et de juges suppléants\r\nchoisis parmi les personnes jouissant de la plus haute considération\r\nmorale et qui tous devront remplir les conditions requises, dans leurs\r\npays respectifs, pour l'admission dans la haute magistrature ou être des\r\njurisconsultes d'une compétence notoire en matière de droit\r\ninternational.\r\n\r\nLes juges et les juges suppléants de la Cour sont choisis, autant que\r\npossible, parmi les membres de la Cour permanente d'arbitrage. Le choix\r\nsera fait dans les six mois qui suivront la ratification de la présente\r\nConvention.\r\n\r\nArticle 3.\r\n\r\nLes juges et les juges suppléants sont nommés pour une période de douze\r\nans à compter de la date où la nomination aura été notifiée au Conseil\r\nadministratif institué par la Convention pour le règlement pacifique des\r\nconflits internationaux. Leur mandat peut être renouvelé.\r\n\r\nEn cas de décès ou de démission d'un juge ou d'un juge suppléant, il est\r\npourvu à son remplacement selon le mode fixé pour sa nomination. Dans ce\r\ncas, la nomination est faite pour une nouvelle période de douze ans.\r\n\r\nArticle 4.\r\n\r\nLes juges de la Cour de justice arbitrale sont égaux entre eux et\r\nprennent rang d'après la date de la notification de leur nomination. La\r\npréséance appartient au plus âgé, au cas où la date est la même.\r\n\r\nLes juges suppléants sont, dans l'exercice de leurs fonctions, assimilés\r\naux juges titulaires. Toutefois, ils prennent rang après ceux-ci.\r\n\r\nArticle 5.\r\n\r\nLes juges jouissent des privilèges et immunités diplomatiques dans\r\nl'exercice de leurs fonctions et en dehors de leurs pays.\r\n\r\nAvant de prendre possession de leur siège, les juges et les juges\r\nsuppléants doivent, devant le Conseil administratif, prêter serment ou\r\nfaire une affirmation solennelle d'exercer leurs fonctions avec\r\nimpartialité et en toute conscience.\r\n\r\nArticle 6.\r\n\r\nLa Cour désigne annuellement trois juges qui forment une Délégation\r\nspéciale et trois autres destinés à les remplacer en cas d'empêchement.\r\nIls peuvent être réélus. L'élection se fait au scrutin de liste. Sont\r\nconsidérés comme élus ceux qui réunissent le plus grand nombre de voix.\r\nLa Délégation élit elle-même son Président, qui, à défaut d'une\r\nmajorité, est désigné par le sort.\r\n\r\nUn membre de la Délégation ne peut exercer ses fonctions quand la\r\nPuissance qui l'a nommé, ou dont il est le national, est une des\r\nParties.\r\n\r\nLes membres de la Délégation terminent les affaires qui leur ont été\r\nsoumises, même au cas où la période pour laquelle ils ont été nommés\r\njuges serait expirée.\r\n\r\nArticle 7.\r\n\r\nL'exercice des fonctions judiciaires est interdit au juge dans les\r\naffaires au sujet desquelles il aura, à un titre quelconque, concouru à\r\nla décision d'un Tribunal national, d'un Tribunal d'arbitrage ou d'une\r\nCommission d'enquête, ou figuré dans l'instance comme conseil ou avocat\r\nd'une Partie.\r\n\r\nAucun juge ne peut intervenir comme agent ou comme avocat devant la Cour\r\nde justice arbitrale ou la Cour permanente d'arbitrage, devant un\r\nTribunal spécial d'arbitrage ou une Commission d'enquête, ni y agir pour\r\nune Partie en quelque qualité que ce soit, pendant toute la durée de son\r\nmandat.\r\n\r\nArticle 8.\r\n\r\nLa Cour élit son Président et son Vice-Président à la majorité absolue\r\ndes suffrages exprimés. Après deux tours de scrutin, l'élection se fait\r\nà la majorité relative et, en cas de partage des voix, le sort décide.\r\n\r\nArticle 9.\r\n\r\nLes juges de la Cour de justice arbitrale reçoivent une indemnité\r\nannuelle de six mille florins néerlandais. Cette indemnité est payée à\r\nl'expiration de chaque semestre à dater du jour de la première réunion\r\nde la Cour.\r\n\r\nPendant l'exercice de leurs fonctions au cours des sessions ou dans les\r\ncas spéciaux prévus par la présente Convention, ils touchent une somme\r\nde cent florins par jour. Il leur est alloué, en outre, une indemnité de\r\nvoyage fixée d'après les règlements de leur pays. Les dispositions du\r\nprésent alinéa s'appliquent aussi aux juges suppléants remplaçant les\r\njuges.\r\n\r\nCes allocations, comprises dans les frais généraux de la Cour, prévus\r\npar l'article 33, sont versées par l'entremise du Bureau international\r\ninstitué par la Convention pour le règlement pacifique des conflits\r\ninternationaux.\r\n\r\nArticle 10.\r\n\r\nLes juges ne peuvent recevoir de leur propre Gouvernement ou de celui\r\nd'une autre Puissance aucune rémunération pour des services rentrant\r\ndans leurs devoirs comme membres de la Cour.\r\n\r\nArticle 11.\r\n\r\nLa Cour de justice arbitrale a son siège à La Haye et ne peut, sauf le\r\ncas de force majeure, le transporter ailleurs.\r\n\r\nLa Délégation peut, avec l'assentiment des Parties, choisir un autre\r\nlieu pour ses réunions si des circonstances particulières l'exigent.\r\n\r\nArticle 12.\r\n\r\nLe Conseil administratif remplit à l'égard de la Cour de justice\r\narbitrale les fonctions qu'il remplit à l'égard de la Cour permanente\r\nd'arbitrage.\r\n\r\nArticle 13.\r\n\r\nLe Bureau international sert de greffe à la Cour de justice arbitrale et\r\ndoit mettre ses locaux et son organisation à la disposition de la Cour.\r\nIl a la garde des archives et la gestion des affaires administratives.\r\n\r\nLe Secrétaire Général du Bureau remplit les fonctions de greffier.\r\n\r\nLes secrétaires adjoints au greffier, les traducteurs et les\r\nsténographes nécessaires sont désignés et assermentés par la Cour.\r\n\r\nArticle 14.\r\n\r\nLa Cour se réunit en session une fois par an. La session commence le\r\ntroisième mercredi de juin et dure tant que l'ordre du jour n'aura pas\r\nété épuisé.\r\n\r\nLa Cour ne se réunit pas en session, si la Délégation estime que cette\r\nréunion n'est pas nécessaire. Toutefois, si une Puissance est partie à\r\nun litige actuellement pendant devant la Cour et dont l'instruction est\r\nterminée ou va être terminée, elle a le droit d'exiger que la session\r\nait lieu.\r\n\r\nEn cas de nécessité, la Délégation peut convoquer la Cour en session\r\nextraordinaire.\r\n\r\nArticle 15.\r\n\r\nUn compte-rendu des travaux de la Cour sera dressé chaque année par la\r\nDélégation. Ce compte-rendu sera transmis aux Puissances contractantes\r\npar l'intermédiaire du Bureau international. Il sera communiqué aussi à\r\ntous les juges et juges suppléants de la Cour.\r\n\r\nArticle 16.\r\n\r\nLes juges et les juges suppléants, membres de la Cour de justice\r\narbitrale, peuvent aussi être nommés aux fonctions de juge et de juge\r\nsuppléant dans la Cour internationale des prises.\r\n\r\nTITRE II.--_Compétence et procédure._\r\n\r\nArticle 17.\r\n\r\nLa Cour de justice arbitrale est compétente pour tous les cas qui sont\r\nportés devant elle, en vertu d'une stipulation générale d'arbitrage ou\r\nd'un accord spécial.\r\n\r\nArticle 18.\r\n\r\nLa Délégation est compétente:\r\n\r\n  1. pour juger les cas d'arbitrage visés à l'article précédent, si\r\n  les Parties sont d'accord pour réclamer l'application de la\r\n  procédure sommaire, réglée au Titre IV Chapitre 4 de la Convention\r\n  pour le règlement pacifique des conflits internationaux;\r\n\r\n  2. pour procéder à une enquête en vertu et en conformité du Titre\r\n  III de ladite Convention en tant que la Délégation en est chargée\r\n  par les Parties agissant d'un commun accord. Avec l'assentiment\r\n  des Parties et par dérogation à l'article 7 alinéa 1, les membres\r\n  de la Délégation ayant pris part à l'enquête peuvent siéger comme\r\n  juges, si le litige est soumis à l'arbitrage de la Cour ou de la\r\n  Délégation elle-même.\r\n\r\nArticle 19.\r\n\r\nLa Délégation est, en outre, compétente pour l'établissement du\r\ncompromis visé par l'article 52 de la Convention pour le règlement\r\npacifique des conflits internationaux, si les Parties sont d'accord pour\r\ns'en remettre à la Cour.\r\n\r\nElle est également compétente, même si la demande est faite seulement\r\npar l'une des Parties, après qu'un accord par la voie diplomatique a été\r\nvainement essayé, quand il s'agit:\r\n\r\n  1'o. d'un différend rentrant dans un traité d'arbitrage général\r\n  conclu ou renouvelé après la mise en vigueur de cette Convention\r\n  et qui prévoit pour chaque différend un compromis, et n'exclut\r\n  pour l'établissement de ce dernier ni explicitement ni\r\n  implicitement la compétence de la Délégation. Toutefois, le\r\n  recours à la Cour n'a pas lieu si l'autre Partie déclare qu'à son\r\n  avis le différend n'appartient pas à la catégorie des questions à\r\n  soumettre à un arbitrage obligatoire, à moins que le traité\r\n  d'arbitrage ne confère au tribunal arbitral le pouvoir de décider\r\n  cette question préalable.\r\n\r\n  2'o. d'un différend provenant de dettes contractuelles réclamées à\r\n  une Puissance par une autre Puissance comme dues à ses nationaux,\r\n  et pour la solution duquel l'offre d'arbitrage a été acceptée.\r\n  Cette disposition n'est pas applicable si l'acceptation a été\r\n  subordonnée à la condition que le compromis soit établi selon un\r\n  autre mode.\r\n\r\nArticle 20.\r\n\r\nChacune des Parties a le droit de désigner un juge de la Cour pour\r\nprendre part, avec voix délibérative, à l'examen de l'affaire soumise à\r\nla Délégation.\r\n\r\nSi la Délégation fonctionne en qualité de Commission d'enquête, ce\r\nmandat peut être confié à des personnes prises en dehors des juges de la\r\nCour. Les frais de déplacement et la rétribution à allouer auxdites\r\npersonnes sont fixés et supportés par les Puissances qui les ont\r\nnommées.\r\n\r\nArticle 21.\r\n\r\nL'accès de la Cour de justice arbitrale, instituée par la présente\r\nConvention, n'est ouvert qu'aux Puissances contractantes.\r\n\r\nArticle 22.\r\n\r\nLa Cour de justice arbitrale suit les règles de procédure édictées par\r\nla Convention pour le règlement pacifique des conflits internationaux,\r\nsauf ce qui est prescrit par la présente Convention.\r\n\r\nArticle 23.\r\n\r\nLa Cour décide du choix de la langue dont elle fera usage, et des\r\nlangues dont l'emploi sera autorisé devant elle.\r\n\r\nArticle 24.\r\n\r\nLe Bureau international sert d'intermédiaire pour toutes les\r\ncommunications à faire aux juges au cours de l'instruction prévue à\r\nl'article 63 alinéa 2 de la Convention pour le règlement pacifique des\r\nconflits internationaux.\r\n\r\nArticle 25.\r\n\r\nPour toutes les notifications à faire, notamment aux Parties, aux\r\ntémoins et aux experts, la Cour peut s'adresser directement au\r\nGouvernement de la Puissance sur le territoire de laquelle la\r\nnotification doit être effectuée. Il en est de même s'il s'agit de\r\nfaire procéder à l'établissement de tout moyen de preuve.\r\n\r\nLes requêtes adressées à cet effet ne peuvent être refusées que si la\r\nPuissance requise le juge de nature à porter atteinte à sa souveraineté\r\nou à sa sécurité. S'il est donné suite à la requête, les frais ne\r\ncomprennent que les dépenses d'exécution réellement effectuées.\r\n\r\nLa Cour a également la faculté de recourir à l'intermédiaire de la\r\nPuissance sur la territoire de laquelle elle a son siège.\r\n\r\nLes notifications à faire aux Parties dans le lieu où siège la Cour\r\npeuvent être exécutées par le Bureau international.\r\n\r\nArticle 26.\r\n\r\nLes débats sont dirigés par le Président ou le Vice-Président et, en cas\r\nd'absence ou d'empêchement de l'un et de l'autre, par le plus ancien des\r\njuges présents.\r\n\r\nLe juge nommé par une des Parties ne peut siéger comme Président.\r\n\r\nArticle 27.\r\n\r\nLes délibérations de la Cour ont lieu à huis clos et restent secrètes.\r\n\r\nToute décision est prise à la majorité des juges présents. Si la Cour\r\nsiège en nombre pair et qu'il y ait partage des voix, la voix du dernier\r\ndes juges, dans l'ordre de préséance établi d'après l'article 4 alinéa\r\n1, ne sera pas comptée.\r\n\r\nArticle 28.\r\n\r\nLes arrêts de la Cour doivent être motivés. Ils mentionnent les noms des\r\njuges qui y ont participé; ils sont signés par le Président et par le\r\ngreffier.\r\n\r\nArticle 29.\r\n\r\nChaque Partie supporte ses propres frais et une part égale des frais\r\nspéciaux de l'instance.\r\n\r\nArticle 30.\r\n\r\nLes dispositions des articles 21 à 29 sont appliquées par analogie dans\r\nla procédure devant la Délégation.\r\n\r\nLorsque le droit d'adjoindre un membre à la Délégation n'a été exercé\r\nque par une seule Partie, la voix du membre adjoint n'est pas comptée,\r\ns'il y a partage de voix.\r\n\r\nArticle 31.\r\n\r\nLes frais généraux de la Cour sont supportés par les Puissances\r\ncontractantes.\r\n\r\nLe Conseil administratif s'adresse aux Puissances pour obtenir les fonds\r\nnécessaires au fonctionnement de la Cour.\r\n\r\nArticle 32.\r\n\r\nLa Cour fait elle-même son règlement d'ordre intérieur qui doit être\r\ncommuniqué aux Puissances contractantes.\r\n\r\nAprès la ratification de la présente Convention, la Cour se réunira\r\naussitôt que possible, pour élaborer ce règlement, pour élire le\r\nPrésident et le Vice-Président ainsi que pour désigner les membres de la\r\nDélégation.\r\n\r\nArticle 33.\r\n\r\nLa Cour peut proposer des modifications à apporter aux dispositions de\r\nla présente Convention qui concernent la procédure. Ces propositions\r\nsont communiquées par l'intermédiaire du Gouvernement des Pays-Bas aux\r\nPuissances contractantes qui se concerteront sur la suite à y donner.\r\n\r\nTITRE III.--_Dispositions finales._\r\n\r\nArticle 34.\r\n\r\nLa présente Convention sera ratifiée dans le plus bref délai possible.\r\n\r\nLes ratifications seront déposées à La Haye.\r\n\r\nIl sera dressé du dépôt de chaque ratification un procès-verbal, dont\r\nune copie, certifiée conforme, sera remise par la voie diplomatique à\r\ntoutes les Puissances signataires.\r\n\r\nArticle 35.\r\n\r\nLa Convention entrera en vigueur six mois après sa ratification.\r\n\r\nElle aura une durée de douze ans, et sera renouvelée tacitement de douze\r\nans en douze ans, sauf dénonciation.\r\n\r\nLa dénonciation devra être notifiée, au moins deux ans avant\r\nl'expiration de chaque période, au Gouvernement des Pays-Bas qui en\r\ndonnera connaissance aux autres Puissances.\r\n\r\nLa dénonciation ne produira effet qu'à l'égard de la Puissance qui\r\nl'aura notifiée. La Convention restera exécutoire dans les rapports\r\nentre les autres Puissances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX VII\r\n\r\n      DECLARATION OF LONDON OF 1909 (Not yet ratified)\r\n      With the Report[945] of the Drafting Committee on each Article\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 945: The several articles of the Declaration of London are\r\nprinted in italics, whereas the Report of the Drafting Committee on each\r\narticle is printed in roman type.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDisposition Préliminaire.\r\n\r\n_Les Puissances Signataires sont d'accord pour constater que les règles\r\ncontenues dans les Chapitres suivants répondent, en substance, aux\r\nprincipes généralement reconnus du droit international._\r\n\r\nCette disposition domine toutes les règles qui suivent. L'esprit en a\r\nété indiqué dans les considérations générales placées en tête de ce\r\nRapport. La Conférence a eu surtout en vue de constater, de préciser, de\r\ncompléter au besoin, ce qui pouvait être considéré comme un droit\r\ncoutumier.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPITRE PREMIER.--_Du blocus en temps de guerre._\r\n\r\nLe blocus est envisagé ici uniquement comme opération de guerre, et l'on\r\nn'a entendu en rien toucher à ce qu'on appelle le _blocus pacifique_.\r\n\r\nArticle 1.\r\n\r\n_Le blocus doit être limité aux ports et aux côtes de l'ennemi ou\r\noccupés par lui._\r\n\r\nLe blocus, opération de guerre, ne peut être dirigé par un belligérant\r\nque contre son adversaire. C'est la règle très simple qui est posée tout\r\nd'abord. Elle n'a toute sa portée que si on la rapproche de l'article\r\n18.\r\n\r\nArticle 2.\r\n\r\n_Conformément à la Déclaration de Paris de 1856, le blocus, pour être\r\nobligatoire, doit être effectif, c'est-à-dire maintenu par une force\r\nsuffisante pour interdire réellement l'accès du littoral ennemi._\r\n\r\nLa première condition pour qu'un blocus soit obligatoire est qu'il soit\r\neffectif. Il y a longtemps que tout le monde est d'accord à ce sujet.\r\nQuant à la définition du blocus effectif, nous avons pensé que nous\r\nn'avions qu'à nous approprier celle qui se trouve dans la Déclaration de\r\nParis du 16 avril 1856, qui lie conventionnellement un grand nombre\r\nd'États et qui est acceptée de fait par les autres.\r\n\r\nArticle 3.\r\n\r\n_La question de savoir si le blocus est effectif est une question de\r\nfait._\r\n\r\nOn comprend que souvent des difficultés s'élèvent sur le point de savoir\r\nsi un blocus est ou non effectif; il y a en jeu des intérêts opposés. Le\r\nbelligérant bloquant veut limiter son effort, et les neutres désirent\r\nque leur commerce soit le moins gêné possible. Des protestations\r\ndiplomatiques ont été parfois formulées à ce sujet. L'appréciation peut\r\nêtre délicate, parce qu'il n'y a pas de règle absolue à poser sur le\r\nnombre et la situation des navires de blocus. Tout dépend des\r\ncirconstances de fait, des conditions géographiques. Suivant les cas, un\r\nnavire suffira pour bloquer un port aussi efficacement que possible,\r\nalors qu'une flotte pourra être insuffisante pour empêcher réellement\r\nl'accès d'un ou de plusieurs ports déclarés bloqués. C'est donc\r\nessentiellement une _question de fait_, à trancher dans chaque espèce,\r\net non d'après une formule arrêtée à l'avance. Qui la tranchera?\r\nL'autorité judiciaire. Ce sera d'abord le tribunal national appelé à\r\nstatuer sur la validité de la prise, et auquel le navire capturé pour\r\nviolation de blocus pourra demander de déclarer la nullité de la prise,\r\nparce que le blocus, n'ayant pas été effectif, n'était pas obligatoire.\r\nCe recours a toujours existé; il pouvait ne pas donner une satisfaction\r\nsuffisante aux Puissances intéressées, parce qu'elles pouvaient estimer\r\nque le tribunal national était assez naturellement porté à considérer\r\ncomme effectif le blocus déclaré tel par son Gouvernement. Mais, quand\r\nla Convention sur la Cour Internationale des Prises entrera en vigueur,\r\nil y aura une juridiction absolument impartiale à laquelle les neutres\r\npourront s'adresser et qui décidera si, dans tel cas, le blocus était\r\neffectif ou non. La possibilité de ce recours, outre qu'elle permettra\r\nde réparer certaines injustices, aura vraisemblablement un effet\r\npréventif, en ce qu'un Gouvernement se préoccupera d'établir ses blocus\r\nde telle façon que l'effet ne puisse pas en être annulé par des\r\ndécisions qui lui causeraient un grand préjudice. L'article 3 a donc\r\ntoute sa portée, si on l'entend en ce sens que la question prévue doit\r\nêtre tranchée judiciairement. C'est pour écarter toute équivoque que\r\nl'explication précédente est insérée dans le Rapport à la demande de la\r\nCommission.\r\n\r\nArticle 4.\r\n\r\n_Le blocus n'est pas considéré comme levé si, par suite du mauvais\r\ntemps, les forces bloquantes se sont momentanément éloignées._\r\n\r\nIl ne suffit pas que le blocus soit établi; il faut qu'il soit maintenu.\r\nS'il vient à être levé, il pourra être repris, mais alors il exigera les\r\nmêmes formalités que s'il était établi pour la première fois.\r\nTraditionnellement, on ne considère pas le blocus comme levé, lorsque\r\nc'est par suite du mauvais temps que les forces bloquantes se sont\r\nmomentanément éloignées. C'est ce que dit l'article 4. Il doit être tenu\r\npour limitatif en ce sens que le mauvais temps est le seul cas de force\r\nmajeure qui puisse être allégué. Si les forces bloquantes s'éloignaient\r\npour toute autre cause, le blocus serait considéré comme levé, et, au\r\ncas où il viendrait à être repris, les articles 12 _in fine_ et 13\r\nseraient applicables.\r\n\r\nArticle 5.\r\n\r\n_Le blocus doit être impartialement appliqué aux divers pavillons._\r\n\r\nLe blocus, opération de guerre légitime, doit être respecté par les\r\nneutres en tant qu'il reste vraiment une opération de guerre ayant pour\r\nbut d'interrompre toutes les relations commerciales du port bloqué. Ce\r\nne peut être un moyen pour un belligérant de favoriser certains\r\npavillons en les laissant passer. C'est ce qu'indique l'article 5.\r\n\r\nArticle 6.\r\n\r\n_Le commandant de la force bloquante peut accorder à des navires de\r\nguerre la permission d'entrer dans le port bloqué et d'en sortir\r\nultérieurement._\r\n\r\nL'interdiction qui s'applique à tous les navires de commerce,\r\ns'applique-t-elle aussi aux navires de guerre? Il n'y a pas de réponse\r\nabsolue à faire. Le commandant des forces de blocus peut estimer qu'il a\r\navantage à intercepter toute communication de la place bloquée, et\r\nrefuser l'accès aux navires de guerre neutres; rien ne lui est imposé.\r\nS'il accorde l'entrée, c'est affaire de courtoisie. Si on a consacré une\r\nrègle pour dire simplement cela, c'est pour qu'on ne puisse pas\r\nprétendre que le blocus a cessé d'être effectif par suite de la\r\npermission accordée à tels et tels navires de guerre neutres.\r\n\r\nLe commandant du blocus doit agir impartialement, comme il est dit dans\r\nl'article 5. Toutefois, par cela seul qu'il a laissé entrer un navire de\r\nguerre, il ne peut être obligé de laisser passer tous les navires de\r\nguerre neutres qui se présenteront. C'est une question d'appréciation.\r\nLa présence d'un navire de guerre neutre dans un port bloqué peut ne pas\r\navoir les mêmes conséquences à toutes les phases du blocus, et le\r\ncommandant doit être laissé maître de juger s'il peut être courtois sans\r\nrien sacrifier de ses intérêts militaires.\r\n\r\nArticle 7.\r\n\r\n_Un navire neutre, en cas de détresse constatée par une autorité des\r\nforces bloquantes, peut pénétrer dans la localité bloquée et en sortir\r\nultérieurement à la condition de n'y avoir laissé ni pris aucun\r\nchargement._\r\n\r\nLa détresse peut expliquer l'entrée d'un navire neutre dans la localité\r\nbloquée. C'est, par exemple, un navire qui manque de vivres ou d'eau,\r\nqui a besoin d'une réparation immédiate. Sa détresse une fois constatée\r\npar une autorité de la force bloquante, il _peut_ franchir la ligne de\r\nblocus; ce n'est pas une faveur qu'il ait à solliciter de l'humanité ou\r\nde la courtoisie de l'autorité bloquante. Celle-ci peut contester l'état\r\nde détresse, mais, l'état une fois vérifié, la conséquence suit\r\nd'elle-même. Le navire qui aura ainsi pénétré dans le port bloqué ne\r\nsera pas obligé d'y rester tout le temps que durera le blocus; il pourra\r\nen sortir quand il sera en état de le faire, quand il se sera procuré\r\nles vivres ou l'eau qui lui sont nécessaires, quand il aura été réparé.\r\nMais la permission qui lui a été accordée n'a pu servir de prétexte à\r\ndes opérations commerciales; c'est pour cela qu'on exige qu'il n'ait\r\nlaissé ou pris aucun chargement.\r\n\r\nIl va sans dire que l'escadre de blocus, qui voudrait absolument\r\nempêcher de passer, pourrait le faire, si elle mettait à la disposition\r\ndu navire en détresse les secours dont il a besoin.\r\n\r\nArticle 8.\r\n\r\n_Le blocus, pour être obligatoire, doit être déclaré conformément à\r\nl'article 9 et notifié conformément aux articles 11 et 16._\r\n\r\nIndépendamment de la condition d'effectivité formulée par la\r\nDéclaration de Paris, un blocus, pour être obligatoire, doit être\r\n_déclaré_ et _notifié_. L'article 8 se borne à poser le principe qui est\r\nappliqué par les articles suivants.\r\n\r\nIl suffit, pour éviter toute équivoque, d'indiquer nettement le sens des\r\ndeux expressions qui vont être fréquemment employées. La _déclaration de\r\nblocus_ est l'acte de l'autorité compétente (Gouvernement ou chef\r\nd'escadre), constatant qu'un blocus est établi ou va l'être dans des\r\nconditions qui doivent être précisées (article 9). La _notification_ est\r\nle fait de porter à la connaissance des Puissances neutres ou de\r\ncertaines autorités la déclaration de blocus (article 11).\r\n\r\nLe plus souvent, ces deux choses--la déclaration et la\r\nnotification--auront lieu préalablement à l'application des règles du\r\nblocus, c'est-à-dire, à l'interdiction réelle du passage. Toutefois,\r\ncomme on le verra plus loin, il est parfois possible que le passage soit\r\ninterdit à raison du fait même du blocus qui est porté à la connaissance\r\nd'un navire approchant d'un port bloqué, au moyen d'une _notification_\r\nqui est _spéciale_, tandis que la notification qui vient d'être définie,\r\net dont il est parlé à l'article 11, a un caractère général.\r\n\r\nArticle 9.\r\n\r\n_La déclaration de blocus est faite, soit par la Puissance bloquante,\r\nsoit par les autorités navales agissant en son nom._\r\n\r\n_Elle précise:_\r\n\r\n  1'o _La date du commencement du blocus;_\r\n\r\n  2'o _Les limites géographiques du littoral bloqué;_\r\n\r\n  3'o _Le délai de sortie à accorder aux navires neutres._\r\n\r\nLa déclaration de blocus émane le plus souvent du Gouvernement\r\nbelligérant lui-même. Le Gouvernement peut avoir laissé au commandant de\r\nses forces navales la faculté de déclarer lui-même un blocus selon les\r\ncirconstances. Cette latitude aura peut-être lieu de s'appliquer moins\r\nsouvent qu'autrefois à raison de la facilité et de la rapidité des\r\ncommunications. Cela importe peu: il y a là une question d'ordre\r\nintérieur.\r\n\r\nLa déclaration de blocus doit préciser certains points que les neutres\r\nont intérêt à connaître pour se rendre compte de l'étendue de leurs\r\nobligations. Il faut que l'on sache exactement quand commence\r\nl'interdiction de communiquer avec la localité bloquée. Il importe, pour\r\nl'obligation du bloquant comme pour l'obligation des neutres, qu'il n'y\r\nait pas d'incertitude sur les points réellement bloqués. Enfin, depuis\r\nlongtemps, s'est établi l'usage de laisser sortir les navires neutres\r\nqui sont dans le port bloqué. On confirme ici cet usage en ce sens que\r\nle bloquant _doit accorder_ un délai de sortie; on ne fixe pas la durée\r\nde ce délai, parce que cette durée est évidemment subordonnée aux\r\ncirconstances très variables. Il a été seulement entendu qu'il y aurait\r\nun délai _raisonnable_.\r\n\r\nArticle 10.\r\n\r\n_Si la Puissance bloquante ou les autorités navales agissant en son nom\r\nne se conforment pas aux mentions qu'en exécution de l'article 9--1'o et\r\n2'o, elles ont dû inscrire dans la déclaration de blocus, cette\r\ndéclaration est nulle, et une nouvelle déclaration est nécessaire pour\r\nque le blocus produise ses effets._\r\n\r\nCet article a pour but d'assurer l'observation de l'article 9. La\r\ndéclaration de blocus contient des mentions qui ne correspondent pas à\r\nla réalité des faits; elle indique que le blocus a commencé ou\r\ncommencera tel jour, et, en fait, il n'a commencé que plusieurs jours\r\naprès. Les limites géographiques sont exactement tracées; elles sont\r\nplus étendues que celles dans lesquelles opèrent les forces de blocus.\r\nQuelle sera la sanction? La nullité de la déclaration de blocus, ce qui\r\nfait que cette déclaration ne produira aucun effet. Si, donc, en pareil\r\ncas, un navire neutre est saisi pour violation de blocus, il pourra\r\nopposer la nullité de la saisie en se fondant sur la nullité de la\r\ndéclaration de blocus; si son moyen est repoussé par le tribunal\r\nnational, il pourra se pourvoir devant la Cour Internationale.\r\n\r\nIl faut remarquer la portée de la disposition pour qu'il n'y ait pas de\r\nsurprise. La déclaration porte que le blocus commence le 1'er février;\r\nen fait, il n'a commencé que le 8. Il va sans dire que la déclaration\r\nn'a produit aucun effet du 1'er au 8, puisqu'à ce moment-là, il n'y\r\navait pas de blocus du tout; la déclaration constate un fait, mais n'en\r\ntient pas lieu. La règle va plus loin: la déclaration ne produira pas\r\nmême effet à partir du 8; elle est nulle définitivement, et il faut en\r\nfaire une autre.\r\n\r\nIl n'est pas parlé ici du cas où l'article 9 aurait été méconnu, en ce\r\nqu'aucun délai de sortie n'aurait été accordé aux navires neutres se\r\ntrouvant dans le port bloqué. La sanction ne saurait être la même. Il\r\nn'y a pas de raison d'annuler la déclaration en ce qui touche les\r\nbâtiments neutres voulant pénétrer dans le porte bloqué. Il faut une\r\nsanction spéciale, qui est indiquée dans l'article 16, alinéa 2.\r\n\r\nArticle 11.\r\n\r\n_La déclaration de blocus est notifiée_:\r\n\r\n  1'o _Aux Puissances neutres, par la Puissance bloquante, au moyen\r\n  d'une communication adressée aux Gouvernements eux-mêmes ou à\r\n  leurs représentants accrédités auprès d'elle;_\r\n\r\n  2'o _Aux autorités locales, par le commandant de la force\r\n  bloquante. Ces autorités, de leur côté, en informeront, aussitôt\r\n  que possible, les consuls étrangers qui exercent leurs fonctions\r\n  dans le port ou sur le littoral bloqués._\r\n\r\nLa déclaration de blocus ne vaut que si elle est notifiée. On ne peut\r\nexiger l'observation d'une règle que de ceux qui ont été en mesure de la\r\nconnaître.\r\n\r\nIl y a deux notifications à faire:\r\n\r\n  1. La première est adressée aux Puissances neutres par la\r\n  Puissance belligérante, qui la communique aux Gouvernements\r\n  eux-mêmes ou à leurs représentants accrédités auprès d'elle. La\r\n  communication aux Gouvernements se fera le plus souvent au moyen\r\n  des agents diplomatiques: il pourrait arriver qu'un belligérant ne\r\n  fût pas en rapports diplomatiques avec un pays neutre; il\r\n  s'adressera directement au Gouvernement de ce pays, ordinairement\r\n  par la voie télégraphique. C'est aux Gouvernements neutres avisés\r\n  de la déclaration de blocus à prendre les mesures nécessaires pour\r\n  en faire parvenir la nouvelle sur les divers points de leur\r\n  territoire, spécialement dans leurs ports.\r\n\r\n  2. La seconde notification est faite par le commandant de la force\r\n  bloquante aux autorités locales. Celles-ci doivent informer,\r\n  aussitôt que possible, les consuls étrangers qui résident dans la\r\n  place ou sur le littoral bloqués. Ces autorités engageraient leur\r\n  responsabilité en ne s'acquittant pas de cette obligation. Les\r\n  neutres pourraient éprouver un préjudice du fait de n'avoir pas\r\n  été prévenus du blocus en temps utile.\r\n\r\nArticle 12.\r\n\r\n_Les règles relatives à la déclaration et à la notification de blocus\r\nsont applicables dans le cas où le blocus serait étendu ou viendrait à\r\nêtre repris après avoir été levé._\r\n\r\nUn blocus est étendu au-delà de ses limites primitives; c'est, pour la\r\npartie nouvelle, un blocus nouveau et, par suite, les règles de la\r\ndéclaration et de la notification doivent s'y appliquer. Il en est de\r\nmême dans le cas où, après avoir été levé, un blocus est repris; il n'y\r\na pas à tenir compte du fait qu'un blocus a déjà existé pour la même\r\nlocalité.\r\n\r\nArticle 13.\r\n\r\n_La levée volontaire du blocus, ainsi que toute restriction qui y serait\r\napportée, doit être notifiée dans la forme prescrite par l'article 11._\r\n\r\nS'il est indispensable de connaître l'établissement d'un blocus, il\r\nserait utile que le public fût renseigné sur la levée du blocus,\r\npuisqu'elle fait cesser l'entrave apportée aux relations des neutres\r\navec le port bloqué. Aussi a-t-on jugé à propos de demander à la\r\nPuissance qui lève un blocus de le faire savoir dans la forme où elle a\r\nnotifié l'établissement du blocus (article 11). Seulement, il y a lieu\r\nde remarquer que la sanction ne saurait être la même dans les deux cas.\r\nPour la notification de la déclaration de blocus, il y a une sanction\r\ndirecte, adéquate: le blocus non notifié n'est pas obligatoire. Pour la\r\nlevée, il ne saurait y avoir rien d'analogue. Le public profitera, en\r\nfait, de cette levée, quand même on ne la lui aurait pas fait connaître\r\nofficiellement. La Puissance bloquante qui n'aurait pas notifié la levée\r\ns'exposerait à des réclamations diplomatiques motivées par\r\nl'inaccomplissement d'un devoir international. Cet inaccomplissement\r\naura des conséquences plus ou moins graves suivant les circonstances.\r\nParfois, la levée du blocus aura été, en fait, immédiatement connue, et\r\nla notification officielle n'ajouterait rien à cette publicité\r\neffective.\r\n\r\nIl va sans dire qu'il ne s'agit que de la levée _volontaire_ du blocus;\r\nsi le bloquant a été chassé par l'arrivée de forces ennemies, il ne peut\r\nêtre tenu de faire connaître sa défaite, que son adversaire se chargera\r\nd'annoncer sans retard. Au lieu de lever un blocus, un belligérant peut\r\nse contenter de le restreindre; il ne bloque plus qu'un port au lieu de\r\ndeux. Pour le port qui cesse d'être compris dans le blocus, c'est comme\r\ns'il y avait levée volontaire; en conséquence, la même règle s'applique.\r\n\r\nArticle 14.\r\n\r\n_La saisissabilité d'un navire neutre pour violation de blocus est\r\nsubordonnée à la connaissance réelle ou présumée du blocus._\r\n\r\nPour qu'un navire soit saisissable pour violation de blocus, la première\r\ncondition est qu'il ait eu connaissance du blocus, parce qu'il n'est pas\r\njuste de punir quelqu'un pour inobservation d'une règle qu'il aurait\r\nignorée. Toutefois, il est des circonstances où, même en l'absence d'une\r\nconnaissance réelle prouvée, on peut présumer cette connaissance, sauf à\r\nréserver à l'intéressé la faculté de démentir la présomption (article\r\n15).\r\n\r\nArticle 15.\r\n\r\n_La connaissance du blocus est, sauf preuve contraire, présumée, lorsque\r\nle navire a quitté un port neutre postérieurement à la notification, en\r\ntemps utile, du blocus à la Puissance dont relève ce port._\r\n\r\nUn navire a quitté un port neutre postérieurement à la notification du\r\nblocus faite à la Puissance dont relève le port. Cette notification\r\navait-elle été faite en temps utile, c'est-à-dire de manière à parvenir\r\ndans le port même où elle a dû être divulguée par les autorités du port?\r\nC'est une question de fait à examiner. Si elle est résolue\r\naffirmativement, il est naturel de supposer que le navire avait eu, lors\r\nde son départ, connaissance du blocus. Cette présomption n'est pourtant\r\npas absolue et la preuve contraire est réservée. Ce sera au navire\r\ninculpé à la fournir, en justifiant de l'existence de circonstances qui\r\nexpliquent son ignorance.\r\n\r\nArticle 16.\r\n\r\n_Si le navire qui approche du port bloqué n'a pas connu ou ne peut être\r\nprésumé avoir connu l'existence du blocus, la notification doit être\r\nfaite au navire même par un officier de l'un des bâtiments de la force\r\nbloquante. Cette notification doit être portée sur le livre de bord avec\r\nindication de la date et de l'heure, ainsi que de la position\r\ngéographique du navire à ce moment._\r\n\r\n_Le navire neutre qui sort du port bloqué, alors que, par la négligence\r\ndu commandant de la force bloquante, aucune déclaration de blocus n'a\r\nété notifiée aux autorités locales ou qu'un délai n'a pas été indiqué\r\ndans la déclaration notifiée, doit être laissé libre de passer._\r\n\r\nOn suppose un navire approchant du port bloqué sans qu'on puisse dire\r\nqu'il connaît ou qu'il est présumé connaître l'existence du blocus; il\r\nn'a été touché par aucune notification dans le sens de l'article 11.\r\nDans ce cas, une notification spéciale est nécessaire pour faire\r\nconnaître régulièrement le fait du blocus au navire. Cette notification\r\nest faite au navire même par un officier de l'un des bâtiments de la\r\nforce bloquante et portée sur le livre de bord; elle peut être faite aux\r\nnavires d'une flotte convoyée par un vaisseau de guerre neutre, grâce à\r\nl'intermédiaire du commandant du convoi qui en donne reçu et qui prend\r\nles mesures nécessaires pour l'inscription de la notification sur le\r\nlivre de bord de chaque navire. Elle mentionne les circonstances de\r\ntemps et de lieu dans lesquelles elle est faite, ainsi que les lieux\r\nbloqués. Le navire est empêché de passer, ce qui fait que le blocus est\r\n_obligatoire_ pour lui, bien que n'ayant pas été _préalablement_\r\nnotifié; c'est pour cela que cet adverbe a été omis dans l'article 8. Il\r\nn'est pas admissible qu'un navire de commerce ait la prétention de ne\r\npas tenir compte d'un blocus réel et de forcer le blocus, par cette\r\nseule raison qu'il n'en avait pas personnellement connaissance.\r\nSeulement, s'il peut être empêché de passer il ne peut être saisi que\r\nlorsqu'il essaie de forcer le blocus après avoir reçu la notification.\r\nComme on le voit, cette notification spéciale joue un rôle très\r\nrestreint, et ne doit pas être confondue avec la notification spéciale\r\nexigée d'une manière absolue dans la pratique de certaines marines.\r\n\r\nCe qui vient d'être dit se réfère au navire venant du large. Il faut\r\naussi s'occuper du navire sortant du port bloqué. Si une notification\r\nrégulière du blocus a été faite aux autorités locales (article 11--2'o),\r\nla situation est simple: le navire connaît, ou est présumé connaître, le\r\nblocus, et s'expose donc à la saisie dans le cas où il n'a pas observé\r\nle délai donné par le bloquant. Mais il peut arriver qu'aucune\r\ndéclaration de blocus n'ait été notifiée aux autorités locales ou que\r\ncette déclaration ait été muette au sujet du délai de sortie, malgré la\r\nprescription de l'article 9--3'o. La sanction de la faute du bloquant\r\nest que le navire doit être laissé libre de passer. C'est une sanction\r\nénergique qui correspond exactement à la nature de la faute commise, et\r\nsera le meilleur moyen d'empêcher de la commettre.\r\n\r\nIl va sans dire que cette disposition ne concerne que les navires\r\nauxquels le délai de sortie avait dû profiter--c'est-à-dire, les navires\r\nneutres qui étaient dans le port au moment de l'établissement du blocus;\r\nelle est absolument étrangère aux navires qui seraient dans le port\r\naprès avoir forcé le blocus.\r\n\r\nLe commandant de l'escadre de blocus est toujours à même de réparer son\r\nomission ou son erreur, de faire une notification du blocus aux\r\nautorités locales ou de compléter celle qu'il aurait déjà faite.\r\n\r\nComme on le voit par ces explications, on suppose le cas le plus\r\nordinaire, celui où l'absence de notification implique une négligence du\r\ncommandant des forces de blocus. La situation se trouve évidemment tout\r\nà fait changée, si le commandant a fait tout ce qui dépendait de lui\r\npour faire la notification et s'il en a été empêché par le mauvais\r\nvouloir des autorités locales qui ont intercepté toute communication\r\navec le dehors. Dans ce cas, il ne peut être forcé de laisser passer les\r\nnavires qui veulent sortir et qui, en l'absence de la notification\r\nexigée et de la connaissance présumée du blocus, sont dans une situation\r\nanalogue à celle qui est prévue par l'article 16, alinéa 1'er.\r\n\r\nArticle 17.\r\n\r\n_La saisie des navires neutres pour violation de blocus ne peut être\r\neffectuée que dans le rayon d'action des bâtiments de_ _guerre chargés\r\nd'assurer l'effectivité du blocus._\r\n\r\nL'autre condition de la saisissabilité du navire est que celui-ci se\r\ntrouve dans le rayon d'action des bâtiments de guerre chargés d'assurer\r\nl'effectivité du blocus: il ne suffit pas qu'il soit en route pour le\r\nport bloqué.\r\n\r\nQuant à ce qui constitue le _rayon d'action_, il a été fourni une\r\nexplication qui a été universellement acceptée, et qui est reproduite\r\nici comme le meilleur commentaire de la règle de l'article 17:\r\n\r\n  \"Lorsqu'un Gouvernement décide d'entreprendre une opération de\r\n  blocus contre une partie quelconque de côte ennemie, il désigne un\r\n  certain nombre de navires de guerre qui devront participer au\r\n  blocus, et il en confie le commandement à un officier qui aura\r\n  pour mission d'assurer par leur moyen l'effectivité du blocus. Le\r\n  commandant de la force navale ainsi constituée repartit les\r\n  navires mis à sa disposition suivant la configuration de la côte\r\n  et la situation géographique des points bloqués, et donne à chacun\r\n  d'eux des instructions sur le rôle qu'il aura à remplir, et en\r\n  particulier sur la zone confiée à sa surveillance. C'est\r\n  l'ensemble de ces zones de surveillance, organisées de telle\r\n  manière que le blocus soit effectif, qui forme le rayon d'action\r\n  de la force navale bloquante.\r\n\r\n  \"Le rayon d'action ainsi compris est étroitement lié à\r\n  l'effectivité du blocus et aussi au nombre des bâtiments qui y\r\n  sont affectés.\r\n\r\n  \"Il peut se présenter des cas où un seul navire suffira pour\r\n  maintenir un blocus effectif--par exemple, à l'entrée d'un port ou\r\n  à l'embouchure d'un fleuve dont l'estuaire est peu étendu--à la\r\n  condition que les circonstances permettent au bloqueur de se tenir\r\n  suffisamment rapproché de l'entrée. Dans ce cas, le rayon d'action\r\n  est lui-même rapproché de la côte. Mais, si les circonstances le\r\n  forcent, au contraire, à se tenir éloigné, il pourra se faire que\r\n  le navire soit insuffisant pour assurer l'effectivité, et il\r\n  deviendra alors nécessaire de lui adjoindre d'autres navires pour\r\n  la maintenir. De ce fait le rayon d'action devient plus étendu et\r\n  plus éloigné de la côte. Il pourra donc varier suivant les\r\n  circonstances et suivant le nombre des navires bloqueurs, mais\r\n  sera toujours limité par la condition que l'effectivité soit\r\n  assurée.\r\n\r\n  \"Il ne semble pas possible d'assigner au rayon d'action des\r\n  limites en chiffres fixes et invariables, pas plus qu'il n'est\r\n  possible de fixer à l'avance et invariablement le nombre des\r\n  bâtiments nécessaires pour assurer l'effectivité de tout blocus.\r\n  Ces éléments doivent être déterminés, suivant les circonstances,\r\n  pour chaque cas particulier de blocus; peut-être pourrait-on le\r\n  faire au moment de la déclaration.\r\n\r\n  \"Il est évident qu'un blocus ne sera pas établi de la même façon\r\n  pour une côte sans défense et pour une côte possédant tous les\r\n  moyens modernes de défense. Il ne saurait être question dans ce\r\n  dernier cas d'appliquer une règle telle que celle qui exigeait\r\n  autrefois des vaisseaux arrêtés et suffisamment proches des points\r\n  bloqués; la situation serait trop dangereuse pour les navires de\r\n  la force bloquante qui, par ailleurs, possèdent aujourd'hui des\r\n  moyens plus puissants leur permettant de surveiller d'une façon\r\n  effective une zone beaucoup plus étendue que jadis.\r\n\r\n  \"Le rayon d'action d'une force navale bloquante pourra s'étendre\r\n  assez loin, mais, comme il dépend du nombre des bâtiments\r\n  concourant à l'effectivité du blocus, et comme il reste toujours\r\n  limité par la condition d'effectivité, il n'atteindra jamais des\r\n  mers éloignées sur lesquelles naviguent des navires de commerce,\r\n  peut-être destinés aux ports bloqués, mais dont la destination est\r\n  subordonnée aux modifications que les circonstances sont\r\n  susceptibles d'apporter au blocus au cours du voyage. En résumé,\r\n  l'idée de rayon d'action liée à celle d'effectivité telle que nous\r\n  avons essayé de la définir, c'est-à-dire, comprenant la zone\r\n  d'opérations des forces bloquantes, permet au belligérant\r\n  d'exercer d'une manière efficace le droit de blocus qui lui est\r\n  reconnu, et, d'un autre côté, elle évite aux neutres d'être\r\n  exposés à grande distance aux inconvénients du blocus, tout en\r\n  leur laissant courir les dangers auxquels ils s'exposent sciemment\r\n  en s'approchant des points dont l'accès est interdit par le\r\n  belligérant.\"\r\n\r\nArticle 18.\r\n\r\n_Les forces bloquantes ne doivent pas barrer l'accès aux ports et aux\r\ncôtes neutres._\r\n\r\nCette règle a été jugée nécessaire pour mieux sauvegarder les intérêts\r\ncommerciaux des pays neutres; elle complète l'article 1'er, d'après\r\nlequel un blocus doit être limité aux ports et côtes de l'ennemi, ce qui\r\nimplique que, puisque c'est une opération de guerre, il ne saurait être\r\ndirigé contre un port neutre, malgré l'intérêt que pourrait y avoir un\r\nbelligérant à raison du rôle de ce port neutre pour le ravitaillement de\r\nson adversaire.\r\n\r\nArticle 19.\r\n\r\n_La violation du blocus est insuffisamment caractérisée pour autoriser\r\nla saisie du navire, lorsque celui-ci est actuellement dirigé vers un\r\nport non bloqué, quelle que soit la destination ultérieure du navire ou\r\nde son chargement._\r\n\r\nC'est la destination réelle du navire qui doit être envisagée, quand il\r\ns'agit de violation de blocus, et non la destination ultérieure de la\r\ncargaison. Cette destination prouvée ou présumée ne peut donc suffire à\r\nautoriser la saisie, pour violation de blocus, d'un navire actuellement\r\ndestiné à un port non bloqué. Mais le croiseur pourrait toujours établir\r\nque cette destination à un port non bloqué est apparente et qu'en\r\nréalité, la destination immédiate du navire est bien le port bloqué.\r\n\r\nArticle 20.\r\n\r\n_Le navire qui, en violation du blocus, est sorti du port bloqué ou a\r\ntenté d'y entrer, reste saisissable tant qu'il est poursuivi par un\r\nbâtiment de la force bloquante. Si la chasse en est abandonnée ou si le\r\nblocus est levé, la saisie n'en peut plus être pratiquée._\r\n\r\nUn navire est sorti du port bloqué ou a tenté d'y entrer. Sera-t-il\r\nindéfiniment saisissable? L'affirmative absolue serait excessive. Ce\r\nnavire doit rester saisissable tant qu'il est poursuivi par un bâtiment\r\nde la force bloquante; il ne suffirait pas qu'il fût rencontré par un\r\ncroiseur de l'ennemi bloquant qui ne ferait pas partie de l'escadre de\r\nblocus. La question de savoir si la chasse est ou non abandonnée est une\r\nquestion de fait; il ne suffit pas que le navire se soit réfugié dans un\r\nport neutre. Le navire qui le poursuit peut attendre sa sortie, de telle\r\nsorte que la chasse est forcément suspendue, mais non abandonnée. La\r\nsaisie n'est plus possible quand le blocus a été levé.\r\n\r\nArticle 21.\r\n\r\n_Le navire reconnu coupable de violation de blocus est confisqué. Le\r\nchargement est également confisqué, à moins qu'il soit prouvé qu'au\r\nmoment où la marchandise a été embarquée, le chargeur n'a ni connu ni pu\r\nconnaître l'intention de violer le blocus._\r\n\r\nLe navire est confisqué dans tous les cas. Le chargement est aussi\r\nconfisqué en principe, mais on laisse à l'intéressé la possibilité\r\nd'exciper de sa bonne foi, c'est-à-dire, de prouver que, lors de\r\nl'embarquement de la marchandise, le chargeur ne connaissait pas et ne\r\npouvait connaître l'intention de violer le blocus.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPITRE II.--_De la contrebande de guerre._\r\n\r\nCe chapitre est l'un des plus importants, sinon le plus important, de la\r\nDéclaration. Il traite d'une matière qui a parfois provoqué de graves\r\nconflits entre les belligérants et les neutres. Aussi a-t-on souvent\r\nréclamé d'une manière pressante un règlement qui établirait d'une\r\nmanière précise les droits et devoirs de chacun. Le commerce pacifique\r\npourra être reconnaissant de la précision qui, pour la première fois,\r\nest apportée à ce sujet, qui l'intéresse au plus haut point.\r\n\r\nLa notion de contrebande de guerre comporte deux éléments: il s'agit\r\nd'objets d'une certaine espèce et d'une certaine destination. Des\r\ncanons, par exemple, sont transportés sur un navire neutre. Sont-ils de\r\nla contrebande? Cela dépend: non, s'ils sont destinés à un Gouvernement\r\nneutre; oui, s'ils sont destinés à un Gouvernement ennemi. Le commerce\r\nde certains objets n'est nullement interdit d'une manière générale\r\npendant la guerre; c'est le commerce de ces objets avec l'ennemi qui est\r\nillicite et contre lequel le belligérant, au détriment duquel il se\r\nfait, peut se protéger par les mesures qu'admet le droit des gens.\r\n\r\nLes articles 22 et 24 énumèrent les objets et matériaux qui sont\r\nsusceptibles de constituer de la contrebande de guerre et qui en\r\nconstituent effectivement, quand ils ont une certaine destination, qui\r\nest déterminée par les articles 30 et 33. La distinction traditionnelle\r\nde la contrebande _absolue_ et de la contrebande _conditionnelle_ est\r\nmaintenue: à la première se réfèrent les articles 22 et 30, à la seconde\r\nles articles 24 et 33.\r\n\r\nArticle 22.\r\n\r\n_Sont de plein droit considérés comme contrebande de guerre les objets\r\net matériaux suivants, compris sous le nom de contrebande absolue,\r\nsavoir:_\r\n\r\n  1'o _Les armes de toute nature, y compris les armes de chasse, et\r\n  les pièces détachées caractérisées._\r\n\r\n  2'o _Les projectiles, gargousses, et cartouches de toute nature,\r\n  et les pièces détachées caractérisées._\r\n\r\n  3'o _Les poudres et les explosifs spécialement affectés à la\r\n  guerre._\r\n\r\n  4'o _Les affûts, caissons, avant-trains, fourgons, forges de\r\n  campagne, et les pièces détachées caractérisées._\r\n\r\n  5'o _Les effets d'habillement et d'équipement militaires\r\n  caractérisés._\r\n\r\n  6'o _Les harnachements militaires caractérisés de toute nature._\r\n\r\n  7'o _Les animaux de selle, de trait et de bât, utilisables pour la\r\n  guerre._\r\n\r\n  8'o _Le matériel de campement et les pièces détachées\r\n  caractérisées._\r\n\r\n   9'o _Les plaques de blindage._\r\n\r\n  10'o _Les bâtiments et embarcations de guerre et les pièces\r\n  détachées spécialement caractérisées comme ne pouvant être\r\n  utilisées que sur un navire de guerre._\r\n\r\n  11'o _Les instruments et appareils exclusivement faits pour la\r\n  fabrication des munitions de guerre, pour la fabrication et la\r\n  réparation des armes et du matériel militaire, terrestre ou\r\n  naval._\r\n\r\nCette liste est celle qui avait été arrêtée à la Deuxième Conférence de\r\nla Paix par le Comité chargé d'étudier spécialement la question de la\r\ncontrebande. Elle était le résultat de concessions mutuelles, et il n'a\r\npas paru sage de rouvrir les discussions à ce sujet, soit pour\r\nretrancher, soit pour ajouter des articles.\r\n\r\nLes mots _sont de plein droit_ veulent dire que la disposition produit\r\nson effet, par le fait même de la guerre, et qu'aucune déclaration des\r\nbelligérants n'est nécessaire. Le commerce est averti dès le temps de\r\npaix.\r\n\r\nArticle 23.\r\n\r\n_Les objets et matériaux qui sont exclusivement employés à la guerre\r\npeuvent être ajoutés à la liste de contrebande absolue au moyen d'une\r\ndéclaration notifiée._\r\n\r\n_La notification est adressée aux Gouvernements des autres Puissances ou\r\nà leurs représentants accrédités auprès de la Puissance qui fait la\r\ndéclaration. La notification faite après l'ouverture des hostilités\r\nn'est adressée qu'aux Puissances neutres._\r\n\r\nCertaines découvertes ou inventions pourraient rendre insuffisante la\r\nliste de l'article 22. Une addition pourra y être faite à condition\r\nqu'il s'agisse d'objets et matériaux _qui sont exclusivement employés à\r\nla guerre_. Cette addition doit être notifiée aux autres Puissances, qui\r\nprendront les mesures nécessaires pour la faire connaître à leurs\r\nnationaux. Théoriquement, la notification peut se faire en temps de paix\r\nou en temps de guerre. Sans doute, le premier cas se présentera\r\nrarement, parce qu'un État faisant une pareille notification pourrait\r\nêtre soupçonné de songer à une guerre; cela aurait néanmoins l'avantage\r\nde renseigner le commerce à l'avance. Il n'y avait pas de raison d'en\r\nexclure la possibilité.\r\n\r\nOn a trouvé excessive la faculté accordée à une Puissance de faire une\r\naddition à la liste en vertu de sa simple déclaration. Il est à\r\nremarquer que cette faculté ne présente pas les dangers qu'on lui\r\nsuppose. D'abord, bien entendu, la déclaration ne produit d'effet que\r\npour celui qui la fait, en ce sens que l'article ajouté ne sera de la\r\ncontrebande que pour lui, en tant que belligérant; les autres États\r\npourront d'ailleurs faire une déclaration analogue. L'addition ne peut\r\nconcerner que des objets _exclusivement employés à la guerre_;\r\nactuellement il serait difficile d'indiquer de tels objets ne rentrant\r\npas dans la liste. L'avenir est réservé. Si une Puissance avait la\r\nprétention d'ajouter à la liste de contrebande absolue des articles non\r\nexclusivement employés à la guerre, elle pourrait s'attirer des\r\nréclamations diplomatiques, puisqu'elle méconnaîtrait une règle\r\nacceptée. De plus, il y aurait un recours éventuel devant la Cour\r\nInternationale des Prises. On peut supposer que la Cour estime que\r\nl'objet mentionné dans la déclaration de contrebande absolue y figure à\r\ntort, parce qu'il n'est pas exclusivement employé à la guerre, mais\r\nqu'il aurait pu rentrer dans une déclaration de contrebande\r\nconditionnelle. La confiscation pourra se justifier si la saisie a été\r\nfaite dans les conditions prévues pour cette espèce de contrebande\r\n(articles 33 à 35), qui diffèrent de celles qu'on applique à la\r\ncontrebande absolue (article 30).\r\n\r\nIl avait été suggéré que, dans l'intérêt du commerce neutre, un délai\r\ndevrait s'écouler entre la notification et son application. Mais cela\r\naurait été très préjudiciable au belligérant qui veut précisément se\r\nprotéger, puisque, pendant le délai, le commerce des articles jugés par\r\nlui dangereux aurait été libre, et que l'effet de sa mesure aurait été\r\nmanqué. Il a été tenu compte, sous une autre forme, des considérations\r\nd'équité qui avaient été invoquées (voir article 43).\r\n\r\nArticle 24.\r\n\r\n_Sont de plein droit considérés comme contrebande de guerre les objets\r\net matériaux susceptibles de servir aux usages de la guerre comme à des\r\nusages pacifiques, et compris sous le nom de contrebande conditionnelle,\r\nsavoir:_\r\n\r\n  1'o _Les vivres._\r\n\r\n  2'o _Les fourrages et les graines propres à la nourriture des\r\n  animaux._\r\n\r\n  3'o _Les vêtements et les tissus d'habillement, les chaussures,\r\n  propres à des usages militaires._\r\n\r\n  4'o _L'or et l'argent monnayés et en lingots, les papiers\r\n  représentatifs de la monnaie._\r\n\r\n  5'o _Les véhicules de toute nature pouvant servir à la guerre,\r\n  ainsi que les pièces détachées._\r\n\r\n  6'o _Les navires, bateaux et embarcations de tout genre, les docks\r\n  flottants, parties de bassins, ainsi que les pièces détachées._\r\n\r\n  7'o _Le matériel fixe ou roulant des chemins de fer, le matériel\r\n  des télégraphes, radiotélégraphes et téléphones._\r\n\r\n  8'o _Les aérostats et les appareils d'aviation, les pièces\r\n  détachées caractérisées ainsi que les accessoires, objets_ _et\r\n  matériaux caractérisés comme devant servir à l'aérostation ou à\r\n  l'aviation._\r\n\r\n  9'o _Les combustibles; les matières lubrifiantes._\r\n\r\n  10'o _Les poudres et les explosifs qui ne sont pas spécialement\r\n  affectés à la guerre._\r\n\r\n  11'o _Les fils de fer barbelés, ainsi que les instruments servant\r\n  à les fixer ou à les couper._\r\n\r\n  12'o _Les fers à cheval et le matériel de maréchalerie._\r\n\r\n  13'o _Les objets de harnachement et de sellerie._\r\n\r\n  14'o _Les jumelles, les télescopes, les chronomètres et les divers\r\n  instruments nautiques._\r\n\r\nSur l'expression _sont de plein droit_, il faut faire la même\r\nobservation qu'à propos de l'article 22. Les objets énumérés ne\r\nconstituent de la contrebande conditionnelle que s'ils ont la\r\ndestination prévue par l'article 33.\r\n\r\nLes _vivres_ comprennent les produits nécessaires ou utiles à\r\nl'alimentation de l'homme, solides ou liquides.\r\n\r\nLes _papiers représentatifs de la monnaie_ ne comprennent que le\r\npapier-monnaie, les billets de banque ayant ou non cours légal. Les\r\nlettres de change et les chèques n'y rentrent pas.\r\n\r\nLes machines et chaudières rentrent dans l'énumération du 6'o.\r\n\r\nLe matériel des chemins de fer comprend le matériel fixe, comme les\r\nrails, les traverses, les plaques tournantes, les pièces destinées à la\r\nconstruction des ponts, et le matériel roulant, comme les locomotives,\r\nles wagons.\r\n\r\nArticle 25.\r\n\r\n_Les objets et matériaux susceptibles de servir aux usages de la guerre\r\ncomme à des usages pacifiques, et autres que ceux visés aux articles 22\r\net 24, peuvent être ajoutés à la liste de contrebande conditionnelle au\r\nmoyen d'une déclaration qui sera notifiée de la manière prévue à\r\nl'article 23, deuxième alinéa._\r\n\r\nCette disposition correspond, pour la contrebande conditionnelle, à la\r\ndisposition de l'article 23 pour la contrebande absolue.\r\n\r\nArticle 26.\r\n\r\n_Si une Puissance renonce, en ce qui la concerne, à considérer comme\r\ncontrebande de guerre des objets et matériaux qui rentrent dans une des\r\ncatégories énumérées aux articles 22 et 24, elle fera connaître son\r\nintention par une déclaration notifiée de la manière prévue à l'article\r\n23, deuxième alinéa._\r\n\r\nUn belligérant peut vouloir ne pas user du droit de considérer comme\r\ncontrebande de guerre les articles rentrant dans les listes ci-dessus.\r\nIl peut lui convenir ou de faire rentrer dans la contrebande\r\nconditionnelle un article compris dans la contrebande absolue ou de\r\ndéclarer libre, en ce qui le concerne, le commerce de tel article\r\nrentrant dans l'une ou dans l'autre catégorie. Il est à désirer qu'il\r\nfasse connaître son intention à ce sujet, et il est probable qu'il le\r\nfera pour avoir le mérite de la mesure. S'il ne le fait pas, et s'il se\r\ncontente de donner des instructions à ses croiseurs, les navires visités\r\nseront agréablement surpris si le visiteur ne leur reproche pas de\r\ntransporter ce qu'eux-mêmes considéraient comme de contrebande. Rien\r\nn'empêche une Puissance de faire une pareille déclaration en temps de\r\npaix. Voir ce qui est dit à propos de l'article 23.\r\n\r\nArticle 27.\r\n\r\n_Les objets et matériaux qui ne sont pas susceptibles de servir aux\r\nusages de la guerre, ne peuvent pas être déclarés contrebande de\r\nguerre._\r\n\r\nL'existence d'une liste dite _libre_ (article 28) rend utile cette\r\naffirmation que les objets qui ne sont pas susceptibles de servir aux\r\nusages de la guerre ne peuvent être déclarés contrebande de guerre. On\r\naurait pu croire que les objets ne rentrant pas dans cette liste peuvent\r\nêtre déclarés au moins de contrebande conditionnelle.\r\n\r\nArticle 28.\r\n\r\n_Ne peuvent pas être déclarés contrebande de guerre les articles\r\nsuivants, savoir:_\r\n\r\n  1'o _Le coton brut, les laines, soies, jutes, lins, chanvres\r\n  bruts, et les autres matières premières des industries textiles,\r\n  ainsi que leurs filés._\r\n\r\n  2'o _Les noix et graines oléagineuses; le coprah._\r\n\r\n  3'o _Les caoutchoucs, résines, gommes et laques; le houblon._\r\n\r\n  4'o _Les peaux brutes, les cornes, os et ivoires._\r\n\r\n  5'o _Les engrais naturels et artificiels, y compris les nitrates\r\n  et phosphates pouvant servir à l'agriculture._\r\n\r\n  6'o _Les minerais._\r\n\r\n  7'o _Les terres, les argiles, la chaux, la craie, les pierres y\r\n  compris les marbres, les briques, ardoises et tuiles._\r\n\r\n  8'o _Les porcelaines et verreries._\r\n\r\n  9'o _Le papier et les matières préparées pour sa fabrication._\r\n\r\n  10'o _Les savons, couleurs, y compris les matières exclusivement\r\n  destinées à les produire, et les vernis._\r\n\r\n  11'o _L'hypochlorite de chaux, les cendres de soude, la soude\r\n  caustique, le sulfate de soude en pains, l'ammoniaque, le sulfate\r\n  d'ammoniaque et le sulfate de cuivre._\r\n\r\n  12'o _Les machines servant à l'agriculture, aux mines, aux\r\n  industries textiles et à l'imprimerie._\r\n\r\n  13'o _Les pierres précieuses, les pierres fines, les perles, la\r\n  nacre et les coraux._\r\n\r\n  14'o _Les horloges, pendules, et montres autres que les\r\n  chronomètres._\r\n\r\n  15'o _Les articles de mode et les objets de fantaisie._\r\n\r\n  16'o _Les plumes de tout genre, les crins et soies._\r\n\r\n  17'o _Les objets d'ameublement ou d'ornement; les meubles et\r\n  accessoires de bureau._\r\n\r\nC'est pour diminuer les inconvénients de la guerre pour le commerce\r\nqu'il a été jugé utile de dresser cette _liste_ dite _libre_, ce qui ne\r\nveut pas dire, comme il a été expliqué plus haut, que tous les objets\r\nrestés en dehors pourraient être déclarés contrebande de guerre.\r\n\r\nLes _minerais_ sont les produits des mines servant à obtenir des métaux\r\n(_metallic ores_).\r\n\r\nOn avait demandé de faire rentrer dans le 10'o les _produits\r\ntinctoriaux_; cela a paru trop général; il y a des matières d'où on tire\r\ndes couleurs, comme le charbon, mais qui servent aussi à d'autres\r\nusages. Les produits qui ne sont utilisés que pour obtenir des couleurs\r\nbénéficient de l'exemption.\r\n\r\nLes \"articles de Paris\" dont tout le monde comprend la signification\r\nrentrent dans le 15'o.\r\n\r\nDans le 16'o, il s'agit des soies de certains animaux comme les porcs et\r\nles sangliers.\r\n\r\nLes tapis et les nattes rentrent dans les objets d'ameublement et\r\nd'ornement (17'o).\r\n\r\nArticle 29.\r\n\r\n_Ne peuvent non plus être considérés comme contrebande de guerre:_\r\n\r\n  1'o _Les objets et matériaux servant exclusivement à soigner les\r\n  malades et les blessés. Toutefois, ils peuvent, en cas de\r\n  nécessité militaire importante, être réquisitionnés, moyennant une\r\n  indemnité, lorsqu'ils ont la destination prévue à l'article 30._\r\n\r\n  2'o _Les objets et matériaux destinés à l'usage du navire où ils\r\n  sont trouvés, ainsi qu'à l'usage de l'équipage et des passagers de\r\n  ce navire pendant la traversée._\r\n\r\nSi les objets énumérés dans l'article 29 ne sont pas non plus considérés\r\ncomme contrebande de guerre, c'est pour des motifs autres que ceux qui\r\nont fait admettre la liste de l'article 28.\r\n\r\nDes raisons d'humanité ont fait écarter les objets et matériaux servant\r\nexclusivement à soigner les malades et les blessés, ce qui comprend\r\nnaturellement les drogues et les divers médicaments. Il ne s'agit pas\r\ndes bateaux hospitaliers, pour lesquels une immunité spéciale est\r\nassurée par la Convention de La Haye du 18 octobre 1907, mais de navires\r\nde commerce ordinaires dont le chargement comprendrait des objets de la\r\nnature indiquée. Le croiseur a toutefois le droit, en cas de nécessité\r\nimportante, de réquisitionner ces objets pour les besoins de son\r\néquipage ou de sa flotte; cette réquisition ne peut être faite que\r\nmoyennant indemnité. Mais il faut remarquer que ce droit de réquisition\r\nne peut s'exercer dans tous les cas. Les objets dont il s'agit doivent\r\navoir la destination prévue à l'article 30, c'est-à-dire, la destination\r\nennemie. Autrement le droit commun reprend son empire: un belligérant ne\r\nsaurait avoir le droit de réquisition à l'égard des navires neutres en\r\npleine mer.\r\n\r\nOn ne peut non plus considérer comme contrebande les objets et matériaux\r\ndestinés à l'usage du navire et qui pourraient, en eux-mêmes et par leur\r\nnature, constituer de la contrebande de guerre, par exemple les armes\r\ndestinées à défendre le navire contre les pirates ou à faire des\r\nsignaux. Il en est de même de ce qui est destiné à l'usage de l'équipage\r\net des passagers pendant la traversée; l'équipage comprend ici tout le\r\npersonnel du navire en général.\r\n\r\n_De la destination de la contrebande._--Comme il a été dit, le deuxième\r\nélément de la notion de contrebande est _la destination_. De grandes\r\ndifficultés se sont produites à ce sujet et se symbolisent dans la\r\n_théorie du voyage continu_, souvent combattue ou invoquée sans que l'on\r\nse rende bien compte de son exacte signification. Il faut envisager\r\nsimplement les situations en elles-mêmes et voir comment elles doivent\r\nêtre réglées de manière à ne pas tracasser inutilement les neutres et à\r\nne pas sacrifier les droits légitimes des belligérants.\r\n\r\nPour amener un rapprochement entre des théories et des pratiques\r\ncontraires, on a séparé, à ce point de vue, la contrebande absolue de la\r\ncontrebande conditionnelle.\r\n\r\nA la contrebande absolue se rapportent les articles 30 à 32, à la\r\ncontrebande conditionnelle les articles 33 à 36.\r\n\r\nArticle 30.\r\n\r\n_Les articles de contrebande absolue sont saisissables, s'il est établi\r\nqu'ils sont destinés au territoire de l'ennemi ou à un territoire occupé\r\npar lui ou à ses forces armées. Peu importe que le transport de ces\r\nobjets se fasse directement ou exige, soit un transbordement, soit un\r\ntrajet par terre._\r\n\r\nLes objets compris dans la liste de l'article 22 constituent de la\r\ncontrebande absolue, quand ils sont destinés à un territoire de l'ennemi\r\nou à un territoire occupé par lui ou à ses forces armées de terre ou de\r\nmer. Ces objets sont saisissables, du moment qu'une pareille\r\ndestination finale peut être établie par le capteur. Ce n'est donc pas\r\nla destination du navire qui est décisive, c'est la destination de la\r\nmarchandise. Celle-ci a beau être à bord d'un navire qui doit la\r\ndébarquer dans un port neutre; du moment que le capteur est à même\r\nd'établir que cette marchandise doit, de là, être transportée en pays\r\nennemi par voie maritime ou terrestre, cela suffit pour justifier la\r\nsaisie et ensuite la confiscation de la cargaison. C'est le principe\r\nmême du voyage continu qui est ainsi consacré, pour la contrebande\r\nabsolue, par l'article 30. On regarde comme ne faisant qu'un tout le\r\ntrajet suivi par la marchandise.\r\n\r\nArticle 31.\r\n\r\n_La destination prévue à l'article 30 est définitivement prouvée dans\r\nles cas suivants:_\r\n\r\n  1'o _Lorsque la marchandise est documentée pour être débarquée\r\n  dans un port de l'ennemi ou pour être livrée à ses forces armées._\r\n\r\n  2'o _Lorsque le navire ne doit aborder qu'à des ports ennemis, ou\r\n  lorsqu'il doit toucher à un port de l'ennemi ou rejoindre ses\r\n  forces armées, avant d'arriver au port neutre pour lequel la\r\n  marchandise est documentée._\r\n\r\nComme il a été dit, c'est au capteur qu'incombe l'obligation de prouver\r\nque la marchandise de contrebande a bien la destination prévue par\r\nl'article 30. Dans certains cas prévus par l'article 31, cette\r\ndestination est _définitivement_ prouvée, c'est-à-dire que la preuve\r\ncontraire n'est pas admise.\r\n\r\n_Premier Cas._--La marchandise est _documentée_ pour être débarquée dans\r\nun port ennemi, c'est-à-dire que, d'après les papiers de bord qui se\r\nréfèrent à cette marchandise, elle doit bien y être débarquée. Il y a\r\nalors un véritable aveu, de la part des intéressés eux-mêmes, de la\r\ndestination ennemie.\r\n\r\n_Deuxième Cas._--Le navire ne doit aborder qu'à des ports ennemis ou\r\nbien il doit toucher à un port ennemi avant d'arriver au port neutre\r\npour lequel la marchandise est documentée. Ainsi cette marchandise doit\r\nbien, d'après les papiers qui la concernent, être débarquée dans un port\r\nneutre, mais le navire qui la porte doit, avant d'arriver à ce port,\r\ntoucher à un port ennemi. Elle sera saisissable et on ne réserve pas la\r\npossibilité de prouver que la destination neutre est réelle et conforme\r\naux intentions des intéressés. La circonstance que, avant de parvenir à\r\ncette destination, le navire touchera à un port ennemi, ferait naître un\r\ntrop grand risque pour le belligérant dont le croiseur visite le navire.\r\nSans supposer même une fraude préméditée, il pourrait y avoir, pour le\r\ncapitaine du navire de commerce, une forte tentation de débarquer la\r\ncontrebande dont il trouverait un prix avantageux, et, pour l'autorité\r\nlocale, la tentation de réquisitionner cette marchandise.\r\n\r\nLe cas où le navire, avant d'arriver au port neutre, doit rejoindre les\r\nforces armées de l'ennemi, est identique.\r\n\r\nPour simplifier, la disposition ne parle que d'un _port ennemi_; il va\r\nde soi qu'il faut lui assimiler le _port occupé par l'ennemi_, comme\r\ncela résulte de la règle générale de l'article 30.\r\n\r\nArticle 32.\r\n\r\n_Les papiers de bord font preuve complète de l'itinéraire du navire\r\ntransportant de la contrebande absolue, à moins que le navire soit\r\nrencontré ayant manifestement dévié de la route qu'il devrait suivre\r\nd'après ses papiers de bord et sans pouvoir justifier d'une cause\r\nsuffisante de cette déviation._\r\n\r\nLes papiers de bord font donc preuve complète de l'itinéraire du navire,\r\nà moins que ce navire soit rencontré dans des circonstances qui montrent\r\nque l'on ne peut se fier à leurs allégations. Voir, d'ailleurs, les\r\nexplications données à propos de l'article 35.\r\n\r\nArticle 33.\r\n\r\n_Les articles de contrebande conditionnelle sont saisissables, s'il est\r\nétabli qu'ils sont destinés à l'usage des forces armées ou des\r\nadministrations de l'État ennemi, à moins, dans ce dernier cas, que les\r\ncirconstances établissent qu'en fait ces articles ne peuvent être\r\nutilisés pour la guerre en cours; cette dernière réserve ne s'applique\r\npas aux envois visés par l'article 24--4'o._\r\n\r\nLes règles qui concernent la contrebande conditionnelle diffèrent de\r\ncelles qui ont été posées pour la contrebande absolue, à un double point\r\nde vue: 1'o il ne s'agit pas d'une destination à l'ennemi en général,\r\nmais d'une destination à l'usage de ses forces armées ou de ses\r\nadministrations; 2'o la doctrine du voyage continu est écartée. A la\r\npremière idée correspondent les articles 33 et 34; à la seconde\r\ncorrespond l'article 35.\r\n\r\nLes objets compris dans la liste de la contrebande conditionnelle\r\npeuvent servir à des usages pacifiques comme à des emplois hostiles. Si,\r\nd'après les circonstances, l'emploi pacifique est certain, la saisie ne\r\nse justifie pas; il en est autrement si l'emploi hostile doit se\r\nsupposer, ce qui arrive, par exemple, s'il s'agit de vivres destinés à\r\nune armée ou à une flotte de l'ennemi, de charbon destiné à une flotte\r\nennemie. En cas pareil, il n'y a évidemment pas de doute. Mais que\r\nfaut-il décider quand c'est à l'usage des administrations civiles\r\nd'État ennemi que les objets sont destinés? C'est de l'argent qui est\r\nenvoyé à une administration civile et qui doit être employé au paiement\r\ndu salaire de ses agents, des rails de chemin de fer qui sont expédiés à\r\nune administration des travaux publics. Il y aura, dans ces cas,\r\n_destination ennemie_ rendant la marchandise saisissable d'abord et\r\nconfiscable ensuite. Cela s'explique pour des raisons à la fois\r\njuridiques et pratiques. L'État est un, quoique les fonctions\r\nnécessaires à son action soient confiées à diverses administrations. Si\r\nune administration civile peut recevoir librement des vivres ou de\r\nl'argent, cela ne profite pas à elle seule, mais à l'État tout entier, y\r\ncompris l'administration militaire, puisque les ressources générales de\r\nl'État augmentent ainsi. Il y a plus: ce que reçoit une administration\r\ncivile peut être jugé plus nécessaire à l'administration militaire et\r\nattribué directement à celle-ci. L'argent ou les vivres réellement\r\ndestinés à une administration civile peuvent se trouver ainsi\r\ndirectement employés aux besoins de l'armée. Cette possibilité, qui\r\nexiste toujours, explique pourquoi la destination aux administrations de\r\nl'État ennemi est assimilée à la destination aux forces armées.\r\n\r\nIl s'agit des _administrations de l'État_, qui sont des dépendances du\r\npouvoir central, et non de toutes les administrations qui peuvent\r\nexister dans l'État ennemi; les administrations locales, municipales,\r\npar exemple, n'y rentrent pas, et ce qui serait destiné à leur usage ne\r\nconstituerait pas de la contrebande.\r\n\r\nLa guerre peut se poursuivre dans des circonstances telles que la\r\ndestination à l'usage d'une administration civile ne puisse être\r\nsuspectée et ne puisse, par conséquent, donner à la marchandise le\r\ncaractère de contrebande. Par exemple, une guerre existe en Europe et\r\nles colonies des pays belligérants ne sont pas, en fait, atteintes par\r\nla guerre. Les vivres ou autres objets de la liste de contrebande\r\nconditionnelle qui seraient destinés à l'usage d'une administration\r\ncivile coloniale ne seraient pas réputés contrebande de guerre, parce\r\nque les considérations invoquées plus haut ne s'appliquent pas dans\r\nl'espèce; il ne peut y avoir emprunt pour les besoins de la guerre des\r\nressources de l'administration civile. Exception est faite pour l'or et\r\nl'argent ou les papiers représentatifs de la monnaie, parce qu'une somme\r\nd'argent peut facilement se transmettre d'un bout du monde à l'autre.\r\n\r\nArticle 34.\r\n\r\n_Il y a présomption de la destination prévue à l'article 33, si l'envoi\r\nest adressé_ _aux autorités ennemies, ou à un commerçant établi en pays\r\nennemi et lorsqu'il est notoire que ce commerçant fournit à l'ennemi des\r\nobjets et matériaux de cette nature. Il en est de même si l'envoi est à\r\ndestination d'une place fortifiée ennemie, ou d'une autre place servant\r\nde base aux forces armées ennemies; toutefois, cette présomption ne\r\ns'applique point au navire de commerce lui-même faisant route vers une\r\nde ces places et dont on entend établir le caractère de contrebande._\r\n\r\n_A défaut des présomptions ci-dessus, la destination est présumée\r\ninnocente._\r\n\r\n_Les présomptions établies dans le présent article admettent la preuve\r\ncontraire._\r\n\r\nOrdinairement les articles de contrebande ne seront pas expressément\r\nadressés aux autorités militaires ou aux administrations de l'État\r\nennemi. On dissimulera plus ou moins la destination véritable; c'est au\r\ncapteur à l'établir pour justifier la saisie. Mais on a cru raisonnable\r\nd'établir des présomptions, soit à raison de la qualité du destinataire,\r\nsoit à raison du caractère de la place à laquelle sont destinés les\r\nobjets. C'est une autorité ennemie ou un commerçant établi en pays\r\nennemi, qui est le fournisseur notoire du Gouvernement ennemi pour les\r\narticles dont il s'agit. C'est une place fortifiée ennemie ou une place\r\nservant de base aux forces armées ennemies, que ce soit une base\r\nd'opérations ou une base de ravitaillement.\r\n\r\nCette présomption générale ne saurait s'appliquer au navire de commerce\r\nlui-même qui se dirigerait vers une place fortifiée et qui peut bien,\r\npar lui-même, constituer de la contrebande relative, mais à la condition\r\nque sa destination à l'usage des forces armées ou des administrations de\r\nl'État ennemi soit directement prouvée.\r\n\r\nA défaut des présomptions précédentes, la destination est présumée\r\ninnocente. C'est le droit commun, d'après lequel le capteur doit prouver\r\nle caractère illicite de la marchandise qu'il prétend saisir.\r\n\r\nEnfin, toutes les présomptions ainsi établies dans l'intérêt du capteur\r\nou contre lui admettent la preuve contraire. Les tribunaux nationaux\r\nd'abord, la Cour Internationale ensuite, apprécieront.\r\n\r\nArticle 35.\r\n\r\n_Les articles de contrebande conditionnelle ne sont saisissables que sur\r\nle navire qui fait route vers le territoire de l'ennemi ou vers un\r\nterritoire occupé par lui ou vers ses forces armées et que ne doit pas\r\nles décharger dans un port intermédiaire neutre._\r\n\r\n_Les papiers de bord font preuve complète de l'itinéraire du navire\r\nainsi que du lieu de déchargement des marchandises, à moins que ce\r\nnavire soit rencontré ayant manifestement dévié de la route_ _qu'il\r\ndevrait suivre d'après ses papiers de bord et sans pouvoir justifier\r\nd'une cause suffisante de cette déviation._\r\n\r\nComme il a été dit plus haut, la doctrine du voyage continu a été\r\nécartée pour la contrebande conditionnelle. Celle-ci n'est donc\r\nsaisissable que si elle doit être débarquée dans un port ennemi. Du\r\nmoment que la marchandise est documentée pour être débarquée dans un\r\nport neutre, elle ne peut constituer de la contrebande, et il n'y a pas\r\nà rechercher si, de ce port neutre, elle doit être expédiée à l'ennemi\r\npar mer ou par terre. C'est la différence essentielle avec la\r\ncontrebande absolue.\r\n\r\nLes papiers de bord font preuve complète de l'itinéraire du navire et du\r\nlieu de déchargement de la cargaison; il en serait autrement si le\r\nnavire était rencontré ayant manifestement dévié de la route qu'il\r\ndevrait suivre d'après ses papiers et sans pouvoir justifier d'une cause\r\nsuffisante de cette déviation.\r\n\r\nCette règle sur la preuve fournie par les papiers de bord a pour but\r\nd'écarter des prétentions élevées à la légère par un croiseur et amenant\r\ndes saisies injustifiées. Elle ne doit pas être entendue d'une manière\r\ntrop absolue qui faciliterait toutes les fraudes. Ainsi elle n'est pas\r\nmaintenue quand le navire est rencontré en mer ayant manifestement dévié\r\nde la route qu'il aurait dû suivre et sans pouvoir justifier de cette\r\ndéviation. Les papiers de bord sont alors contredits par la réalité des\r\nfaits et perdent toute force probante; le croiseur se décidera librement\r\nsuivant les cas. De même, la visite du navire peut permettre de\r\nconstater des faits qui prouvent d'une manière irréfutable que la\r\ndestination du navire ou le lieu de déchargement de la marchandise sont\r\nfaussement indiqués dans les papiers de bord. Le croiseur apprécie alors\r\nlibrement les circonstances et saisit ou non le navire suivant cette\r\nappréciation. En résumé, les papiers de bord font preuve, à moins que la\r\nfausseté de leurs indications ne soit démontrée par les faits. Cette\r\nrestriction de la force probante des papiers de bord a paru aller de soi\r\net ne pas avoir besoin d'être expressément mentionnée. On n'a pas voulu\r\navoir l'air de diminuer la force de la règle générale, qui est une\r\ngarantie pour le commerce neutre.\r\n\r\nDe ce qu'une indication est reconnue fausse, il ne résulte pas que la\r\nforce probante des papiers de bord soit infirmée dans son ensemble. Les\r\nindications pour lesquelles aucune allégation de fausseté ne peut être\r\nvérifiée conservent leur valeur.\r\n\r\nArticle 36.\r\n\r\n_Par dérogation à l'article 35, si le territoire de l'ennemi n'a pas de\r\nfrontière_ _maritime, les articles de contrebande conditionnelle sont\r\nsaisissables, lorsqu'il est établi qu'ils ont la destination prévue à\r\nl'article 33._\r\n\r\nLe cas prévu est assurément rare, mais cependant il s'est présenté dans\r\ndes guerres récentes. Pour la contrebande absolue, il n'y a pas de\r\ndifficulté, puisque la destination à l'ennemi peut toujours être\r\nprouvée, quel que soit l'itinéraire à suivre par la marchandise (article\r\n30). Il en est autrement pour la contrebande conditionnelle, et une\r\ndérogation doit être apportée à la règle générale de l'article 35,\r\nalinéa 1'er, de manière à permettre au capteur d'établir que la\r\nmarchandise suspecte a bien la destination spéciale prévue à l'article\r\n33, sans qu'on puisse objecter le fait du déchargement dans un port\r\nneutre.\r\n\r\nArticle 37.\r\n\r\n_Le navire transportant des articles, qui sont saisissables comme\r\ncontrebande absolue ou conditionnelle, peut être saisi, en haute mer ou\r\ndans les eaux des belligérants, pendant tout le cours de son voyage,\r\nmême s'il a l'intention de toucher à un port d'escale avant d'atteindre\r\nla destination ennemie._\r\n\r\nLe navire peut être saisi pour cause de contrebande pendant tout le\r\ncours de son voyage, pourvu qu'il soit dans des eaux où un acte de\r\nguerre est licite. Le fait qu'il aurait l'intention de toucher à un port\r\nd'escale avant d'atteindre la destination ennemie n'empêche pas la\r\nsaisie, du moment que, dans l'espèce, la destination ennemie est établie\r\nconformément aux règles établies par les articles 30 à 32 pour la\r\ncontrebande absolue, par les articles 33 à 35 pour la contrebande\r\nconditionnelle, et sous la réserve de l'exception de l'article 36.\r\n\r\nArticle 38.\r\n\r\n_Une saisie ne peut être pratiquée en raison d'un transport de\r\ncontrebande antérieurement effectué et actuellement achevé._\r\n\r\nUn navire est saisissable quand il transporte de la contrebande, mais\r\nnon pour en avoir transporté.\r\n\r\nArticle 39.\r\n\r\n_Les articles de contrebande sont sujets à confiscation._\r\n\r\nCela ne présente aucune difficulté.\r\n\r\nArticle 40.\r\n\r\n_La confiscation du navire transportant de la contrebande est permise,\r\nsi cette contrebande forme, soit par sa valeur, soit par son poids, soit\r\npar son volume, soit par son fret, plus de la moitié de la cargaison._\r\n\r\nTout le monde admettait bien que, dans certains cas, la confiscation de\r\nla contrebande ne suffit pas et que la confiscation doit atteindre le\r\nnavire lui-même, mais les opinions différaient sur la détermination de\r\nces cas. On s'est arrêté à une certaine proportion à établir entre la\r\ncontrebande et l'ensemble de la cargaison. Mais la question se\r\nsubdivise: 1'o Quelle sera cette proportion? La solution adoptée tient\r\nle milieu entre les solutions proposées, qui allaient du quart aux trois\r\nquarts. 2'o Comment sera calculée cette proportion? La contrebande\r\ndevra-t-elle former plus de la moitié de la cargaison en volume, en\r\npoids, en valeur, en fret? L'adoption d'un critérium déterminé prête à\r\ndes objections théoriques et facilite aussi des pratiques destinées à\r\néviter la confiscation du navire malgré l'importance de la cargaison. Si\r\non prend le volume ou le poids, le capitaine prendra des marchandises\r\nlicites assez volumineuses ou pesantes pour que le volume ou le poids de\r\nla contrebande soit inférieur. Une observation analogue peut être faite\r\nen ce qui concerne la valeur ou le fret. La conséquence est qu'il\r\nsuffit, pour justifier la confiscation, que la contrebande forme plus de\r\nla moitié de la cargaison à l'un quelconque des points de vue indiqués.\r\nCela peut paraître sévère; mais, d'une part, en procédant autrement, on\r\nfaciliterait des calculs frauduleux, et d'autre part, il est permis de\r\ndire que la confiscation du navire est justifiée, lorsque le transport\r\nde la contrebande était une partie notable de son trafic, ce qui est\r\nvrai pour chacun des cas prévus.\r\n\r\nArticle 41.\r\n\r\n_Si le navire transportant de la contrebande est relâché, les frais\r\noccasionnés au capteur par la procédure devant la juridiction nationale\r\ndes prises ainsi que par la conservation du navire et de sa cargaison\r\npendant l'instruction sont à la charge du navire._\r\n\r\nIl n'est pas juste que, d'une part, le transport de contrebande au-delà\r\nd'une certaine proportion entraîne la confiscation du navire, tandis\r\nqu'au-dessous de cette proportion, il n'y a que la confiscation de la\r\ncontrebande, ce qui souvent n'est pas une perte pour le capitaine, le\r\nfret de cette contrebande ayant été payé à l'avance. N'y a-t-il pas là\r\nun encouragement à la contrebande, et ne conviendrait-il pas de faire\r\nsubir une certaine peine pour le transport inférieur à la proportion\r\nrequise pour la confiscation? On avait proposé une espèce d'amende qui\r\naurait pu être en rapport avec la valeur des articles de contrebande.\r\nDes objections d'ordre divers ont été formulées contre cette\r\nproposition, bien que le principe d'une perte pécuniaire infligée à\r\nraison du transport de la contrebande eût paru justifié. On est arrivé\r\nau même but d'une autre façon en disposant que les frais occasionnés au\r\ncapteur par la procédure devant la juridiction nationale des prises,\r\ncomme par la conservation du navire et de sa cargaison pendant\r\nl'instruction, sont à la charge du navire; les frais de conservation du\r\nnavire comprennent, le cas échéant, les frais d'entretien du personnel\r\ndu navire capturé. Il convient d'ajouter que le dommage causé au navire\r\npar sa conduite et son séjour dans un port de prise est de nature à\r\nproduire l'effet préventif le plus sérieux en ce qui concerne le\r\ntransport de la contrebande.\r\n\r\nArticle 42.\r\n\r\n_Les marchandises qui appartiennent au propriétaire de la contrebande et\r\nqui se trouvent à bord du même navire sont sujettes à confiscation._\r\n\r\nLe propriétaire de la contrebande est puni d'abord par la confiscation\r\nde sa propriété illicite; il l'est ensuite par la confiscation des\r\nmarchandises, même licites, qu'il peut avoir sur le même navire.\r\n\r\nArticle 43.\r\n\r\n_Si un navire est rencontré en mer naviguant dans l'ignorance des\r\nhostilités ou de la déclaration de contrebande applicable à son\r\nchargement, les articles de contrebande ne peuvent être confisqués que\r\nmoyennant indemnité; le navire et le surplus de la cargaison sont\r\nexempts de la confiscation et des frais prévus par l'article 41. Il en\r\nest de même si le capitaine, après avoir eu connaissance de l'ouverture\r\ndes hostilités ou de la déclaration de contrebande, n'a pu encore\r\ndécharger les articles de contrebande._\r\n\r\n_Le navire est réputé connaître l'état de guerre ou la déclaration de\r\ncontrebande, lorsqu'il a quitté un port neutre, après que la\r\nnotification de l'ouverture des hostilités ou de la déclaration de\r\ncontrebande a été faite, en temps utile, à la Puissance dont relève ce\r\nport. L'état de guerre est, en outre, réputé connu par le navire\r\nlorsqu'il a quitté un port ennemi après l'ouverture des hostilités._\r\n\r\nLa disposition a pour but de ménager les neutres qui, en fait,\r\ntransporteraient de la contrebande, mais auxquels on ne pourrait rien\r\nreprocher, ce qui peut se présenter dans deux cas. Le premier est celui\r\noù ils ne connaissent pas l'ouverture des hostilités; le second est\r\ncelui où, tout en connaissant cette ouverture, ils ignorent la\r\ndéclaration de contrebande qu'a faite un belligérant conformément aux\r\narticles 23 et 25, et qui est précisément applicable à tout ou partie du\r\nchargement. Il serait injuste de saisir le navire et de confisquer la\r\ncontrebande; d'autre part, le croiseur ne peut être obligé de laisser\r\naller à l'ennemi des produits propres à la guerre et dont celui-ci peut\r\navoir grand besoin. Les intérêts en présence sont conciliés en ce sens\r\nqu'alors la confiscation ne peut avoir lieu que moyennant indemnité\r\n(voir, dans un ordre d'idées analogue, la Convention du 18 octobre 1907,\r\nsur le régime des navires de commerce ennemis au début des hostilités).\r\n\r\nArticle 44.\r\n\r\n_Le navire arrêté pour cause de contrebande et non susceptible de\r\nconfiscation à raison de la proportion de la contrebande peut être\r\nautorisé, suivant les circonstances, à continuer sa route, si le\r\ncapitaine est prêt à livrer la contrebande au bâtiment belligérant._\r\n\r\n_La remise de la contrebande est mentionnée par le capteur sur le livre\r\nde bord du navire arrêté, et le capitaine de ce navire doit remettre au\r\ncapteur copie certifiée conforme de tous papiers utiles._\r\n\r\n_Le capteur a la faculté de détruire la contrebande qui lui est ainsi\r\nlivrée._\r\n\r\nUn navire neutre est arrêté pour cause de contrebande. Il n'est pas\r\nsusceptible de confiscation, parce que la contrebande n'atteint pas la\r\nproportion prévue par l'article 40. Il peut néanmoins être conduit dans\r\nun port de prise pour qu'il y ait un jugement relatif à la contrebande.\r\nCe droit du capteur paraît excessif dans certains cas, si on compare le\r\npeu d'importance que peut avoir la contrebande (une caisse de fusils ou\r\nde revolvers, par exemple) et le grave préjudice qu'entraînent pour le\r\nnavire ce détournement de sa route et sa retenue pendant le temps de\r\nl'instruction. Aussi s'est-on demandé s'il n'était pas possible de\r\nreconnaître au navire neutre le droit de continuer sa route moyennant la\r\nremise des objets de contrebande au capteur qui, de son côté, n'aurait\r\npu les refuser que pour des motifs suffisants, par exemple, le mauvais\r\nétat de la mer, qui rend le transbordement impossible ou difficile, des\r\nsoupçons fondés au sujet de la quantité véritable de contrebande que\r\nporte le navire de commerce, la difficulté de loger les objets à bord du\r\nnavire de guerre, etc. Cette proposition n'a pas réuni les suffrages\r\nsuffisants. On a prétendu qu'il était impossible d'imposer une pareille\r\nobligation au croiseur pour lequel cette remise présenterait presque\r\ntoujours des inconvénients. Si, par hasard, il n'y en a pas, le croiseur\r\nne la refusera pas, parce qu'il aura lui-même avantage à ne pas être\r\ndétourné de sa route par la nécessité de conduire le navire dans un\r\nport. Le système de l'obligation étant ainsi écarté, on a décidé de\r\nréglementer la remise facultative qui, espère-t-on, sera pratiquée\r\ntoutes les fois que ce sera possible, au grand avantage des deux\r\nparties. Les formalités prévues sont très simples et n'exigent pas\r\nd'explication.\r\n\r\nUn jugement du tribunal des prises devra intervenir au sujet de la\r\nmarchandise ainsi remise. C'est pour cela que le capteur doit se munir\r\ndes papiers nécessaires. On pourrait concevoir qu'il y eût doute sur le\r\ncaractère de certains objets que le croiseur prétend être de\r\ncontrebande; le capitaine du navire de commerce conteste, mais il\r\npréfère les livrer pour avoir la faculté de continuer sa route. Il n'y a\r\nlà qu'une saisie devant être confirmée par la juridiction des prises.\r\n\r\nLa contrebande livrée par le navire de commerce peut embarrasser le\r\ncroiseur qui doit être laissé libre de la détruire au moment même de la\r\nremise ou postérieurement.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPITRE III.--_De l'assistance hostile._\r\n\r\nD'une manière générale, on peut dire que le navire de commerce qui\r\nmanque à la neutralité, soit en transportant de la contrebande de\r\nguerre, soit en violant un blocus, fournit une assistance à l'ennemi, et\r\nc'est à ce titre que le belligérant au préjudice duquel il agit peut lui\r\nfaire subir certaines pertes. Mais il y a des cas où cette assistance\r\nhostile est particulièrement caractérisée et qu'on a jugé nécessaire de\r\nprévoir spécialement. On en a fait deux catégories d'après la gravité du\r\nfait reproché au navire neutre.\r\n\r\nDans les cas qui rentrent dans la première catégorie (article 45), le\r\nnavire est confisqué, et on lui applique le traitement du navire sujet à\r\nconfiscation pour transport de contrebande. Cela signifie que le navire\r\nne perd pas sa qualité de neutre et a droit aux garanties admises pour\r\nles navires neutres; par exemple, il ne pourrait être détruit par le\r\ncapteur que dans les conditions établies pour les navires neutres\r\n(articles 48 et suivants); la règle _le pavillon couvre la marchandise_\r\ns'applique en ce qui concerne la marchandise qui se trouve à bord.\r\n\r\nDans les cas plus graves qui appartiennent à la seconde catégorie\r\n(article 46), le navire est encore confisqué; de plus, il n'est pas\r\ntraité seulement comme un navire confiscable comme porteur de\r\ncontrebande, mais comme un navire de commerce ennemi, ce qui entraîne\r\ncertaines conséquences. Le règlement sur la destruction des prises\r\nneutres ne s'applique pas au navire, et, celui-ci devenant navire\r\nennemi, ce n'est plus la seconde, mais c'est la troisième règle de la\r\nDéclaration de Paris qui est applicable. La marchandise qui sera à bord\r\nsera présumée ennemie; les neutres auront le droit de réclamer leur\r\npropriété en justifiant de leur neutralité (article 59). Il ne faut\r\ncependant pas exagérer jusqu'à penser que le caractère neutre originaire\r\ndu navire est complètement effacé, de telle sorte qu'il doive être\r\ntraité comme s'il avait toujours été ennemi. Le navire peut soutenir que\r\nla prétention élevée contre lui n'est pas fondée, que l'acte qui lui est\r\nreproché n'a pas le caractère d'une assistance hostile. Il a donc le\r\ndroit de recourir à la juridiction internationale en vertu des\r\ndispositions qui protègent les propriétés neutres.\r\n\r\nArticle 45.\r\n\r\n_Un navire neutre est confisqué et, d'une manière générale, passible du\r\ntraitement que subirait un navire neutre sujet à confiscation pour\r\ncontrebande de guerre:_\r\n\r\n  1'o _Lorsqu'il voyage spécialement en vue du transport de\r\n  passagers individuels incorporés dans la force armée de l'ennemi,\r\n  ou en vue de la transmission de nouvelles dans l'intérêt de\r\n  l'ennemi._\r\n\r\n  2'o _Lorsqu'à la connaissance soit du propriétaire, soit de celui\r\n  qui a affrété le navire en totalité, soit du capitaine, il\r\n  transporte un détachement militaire de l'ennemi ou une ou\r\n  plusieurs personnes qui, pendant le voyage, prêtent une assistance\r\n  directe aux opérations de l'ennemi._\r\n\r\n_Dans les cas visés aux numéros précédents, les marchandises appartenant\r\nau propriétaire du navire sont également sujettes à confiscation._\r\n\r\n_Les dispositions du présent article ne s'appliquent pas si, lorsque le\r\nnavire est rencontré en mer, il ignore les hostilités, ou si le\r\ncapitaine, après avoir appris l'ouverture des hostilités, n'a pu encore\r\ndébarquer les personnes transportées. Le navire est réputé connaître\r\nl'état de guerre lorsqu'il a quitté un port ennemi après l'ouverture des\r\nhostilités ou un port neutre postérieurement à la notification en temps\r\nutile de l'ouverture des hostilités à la Puissance dont relève ce port._\r\n\r\nLe premier cas suppose des passagers voyageant _individuellement_; le\r\ncas d'un _détachement militaire_ est visé ci-après. Il s'agit\r\nd'individus _incorporés_ dans la force armée de terre ou de mer de\r\nl'ennemi. Il y a eu quelque hésitation sur le sens de l'_incorporation_\r\nqui est prévue. Comprend-elle seulement les individus qui, appelés à\r\nservir en vertu de la loi de leur pays, ont effectivement rejoint le\r\ncorps dont ils doivent faire partie? ou comprend-elle même ces individus\r\ndès qu'ils sont appelés et avant qu'ils aient rejoint leur corps? La\r\nquestion a une grande importance pratique. Que l'on suppose des\r\nindividus originaires d'un pays de l'Europe continentale et établis en\r\nAmérique; ces individus sont tenus à des obligations militaires envers\r\nleur pays d'origine; ils doivent, par exemple, faire partie de la\r\nréserve de l'armée active de ce pays. Leur patrie étant en guerre, ils\r\ns'embarquent pour aller faire leur service. Seront-ils considérés comme\r\n_incorporés_ pour l'application de la disposition dont nous nous\r\noccupons? Si on s'attachait à la législation intérieure de certains\r\npays, l'affirmation pourrait être soutenue. Mais, indépendamment des\r\nraisons purement juridiques, l'opinion contraire a paru plus conforme\r\naux nécessités pratiques et, dans un esprit de conciliation, elle a été\r\nacceptée par tous. Il serait difficile, ou peut-être même impossible, de\r\ndistinguer, sans des mesures vexatoires que les Gouvernements neutres\r\nn'accepteraient pas, entre les passagers d'un navire, ceux qui sont\r\ntenus d'un service militaire, et qui voyagent pour y satisfaire.\r\n\r\nLa transmission de nouvelles dans l'intérêt de l'ennemi est assimilée au\r\ntransport de passagers incorporés dans sa force armée. On parle du\r\nnavire qui voyage _spécialement_ pour indiquer qu'il ne s'agit pas du\r\nservice normal du navire. Il s'est détourné de sa route; il a relâché\r\ndans un port où il ne s'arrête pas ordinairement, pour effectuer le\r\ntransport en question. Il n'est pas nécessaire qu'il soit\r\n_exclusivement_ affecté au service de l'ennemi; ce dernier cas\r\nrentrerait dans la seconde catégorie, article 56, 4'o.\r\n\r\nDans les deux hypothèses dont il vient d'être parlé, il s'agit d'une\r\nopération isolée faite par le navire; il a été chargé d'effectuer tel\r\ntransport ou de transmettre telles nouvelles; il n'est pas attaché d'une\r\nmanière continue au service de l'ennemi. Il en résulte qu'il peut bien\r\nêtre saisi pendant le voyage où il se livre à l'opération qui lui est\r\nconfiée; ce voyage terminé, tout est fini en ce sens qu'il ne pourrait\r\nêtre saisi pour avoir fait l'opération prévue; c'est analogue à ce qui\r\nest admis en matière de contrebande (article 38).\r\n\r\nLe deuxième cas se subdivise également.\r\n\r\nTransport d'un détachement militaire de l'ennemi ou transport d'une ou\r\nde plusieurs personnes qui, pendant le voyage, prêtent une assistance\r\ndirecte aux opérations de l'ennemi, par exemple en faisant des signaux.\r\nS'il s'agit de militaires ou de marins en uniforme, il n'y a pas de\r\ndifficulté: le navire est évidemment confiscable. S'il s'agit de\r\nmilitaires ou de marins en costume civil pouvant être pris pour des\r\npassagers ordinaires, on exige la connaissance du capitaine ou du\r\npropriétaire, celui qui a affrété le navire en totalité étant assimilé\r\nau propriétaire. La règle est la même pour l'hypothèse des personnes\r\nprêtant une assistance directe à l'ennemi pendant le voyage.\r\n\r\nDans ces cas, si le navire est confisqué à raison de son assistance\r\nhostile, l'on doit confisquer également les marchandises appartenant au\r\npropriétaire du navire.\r\n\r\nCes dispositions supposent que l'état de guerre était connu du navire\r\nqui se livre aux opérations prévues; cette connaissance motive et\r\njustifie la confiscation. La situation est tout autre lorsque le navire\r\nignore l'ouverture des hostilités, de telle sorte qu'il s'est chargé de\r\nl'opération en temps normal. Il a pu apprendre en mer l'ouverture des\r\nhostilités, mais sans pouvoir débarquer les personnes transportées. La\r\nconfiscation serait alors injuste, et la règle équitable qui a été\r\nadoptée est d'accord avec les dispositions déjà acceptées dans d'autres\r\nmatières. Si le navire a quitté un port ennemi après l'ouverture des\r\nhostilités, ou un port neutre après que l'ouverture des hostilités avait\r\nété notifiée à la Puissance d'où relève ce port, la connaissance de\r\nl'état de guerre sera présumée.\r\n\r\nIl n'est question ici que d'empêcher la confiscation du navire. Les\r\npersonnes trouvées à bord et qui font partie des forces armées de\r\nl'ennemi pourront être prises par le croiseur comme prisonniers de\r\nguerre.\r\n\r\nArticle 46.\r\n\r\n_Un navire neutre est confisqué et, d'une manière générale, passible du\r\ntraitement qu'il subirait s'il était un navire de commerce ennemi:_\r\n\r\n  1'o _Lorsqu'il prend une part directe aux hostilités._\r\n\r\n  2'o _Lorsqu'il se trouve sous les ordres ou sous le contrôle d'un\r\n  agent placé à bord par le Gouvernement ennemi._\r\n\r\n  3'o _Lorsqu'il est affrété en totalité par le Gouvernement\r\n  ennemi._\r\n\r\n  4'o _Lorsqu'il est actuellement et exclusivement affecté, soit au\r\n  transport de troupes ennemies, soit à la transmission de nouvelles\r\n  dans l'intérêt de l'ennemi._\r\n\r\n_Dans les cas visés par le présent article, les marchandises appartenant\r\nau propriétaire du navire sont également sujettes à confiscation._\r\n\r\nLes cas prévus ici sont plus graves que ceux de l'article 45, ce qui\r\njustifie le traitement plus sévère infligé au navire, ainsi qu'il a été\r\nexpliqué plus haut.\r\n\r\n_Premier cas._--Le navire prend une part directe aux hostilités. Cela\r\npeut se présenter sous diverses formes. Il va sans dire que, s'il y a\r\nlutte armée, le navire est exposé à tous les risques d'une pareille\r\nlutte. On suppose qu'il est tombé au pouvoir de l'ennemi qu'il\r\ncombattait, et qui est autorisé à le traiter comme un navire de commerce\r\nennemi.\r\n\r\n_Deuxième cas._--Le navire est sous les ordres ou sous le contrôle d'un\r\nagent placé à bord par le Gouvernement ennemi. Cette présence\r\ncaractérise le lien qui existe entre l'ennemi et le navire. Dans\r\nd'autres circonstances, le navire peut bien avoir un lien avec l'ennemi;\r\nmais pour être sujet à la confiscation, il faudrait alors qu'il rentrât\r\ndans le troisième cas.\r\n\r\n_Troisième cas._--Le navire est affrété en totalité par le Gouvernement\r\nennemi. Il est donc complètement à la disposition de ce Gouvernement,\r\nqui peut s'en servir pour des buts divers se rattachant plus ou moins\r\ndirectement à la guerre, notamment pour effectuer des transports; c'est\r\nla situation de navires charbonniers qui accompagnent une flotte\r\nbelligérante. Souvent il y aura une charte-partie entre le Gouvernement\r\nbelligérant et le propriétaire ou le capitaine du navire; mais il n'y a\r\nlà qu'une question de preuve. Le fait de l'affrètement en totalité\r\nsuffit, de quelque façon qu'il soit établi.\r\n\r\n_Quatrième cas._--Le navire est actuellement et exclusivement affecté,\r\nsoit au transport de troupes ennemies, soit à la transmission de\r\nnouvelles dans l'intérêt de l'ennemi. A la différence des cas visés dans\r\nl'article 45, il s'agit ici d'un service permanent auquel est affecté le\r\nnavire. Aussi faut-il décider que, tant que l'affectation dure, le\r\nnavire est saisissable, encore qu'au moment où un croiseur ennemi visite\r\nle navire, celui-ci ne transporte pas de troupes ou ne serve pas à la\r\ntransmission de nouvelles.\r\n\r\nComme pour les cas de l'article 45, et par les mêmes raisons, les\r\nmarchandises appartenant au propriétaire du navire, et qui pourraient se\r\ntrouver à bord, sont également sujettes à confiscation.\r\n\r\nOn avait proposé de considérer comme navire de commerce ennemi le navire\r\nneutre faisant actuellement et avec l'autorisation du Gouvernement\r\nennemi un trajet auquel il n'a été autorisé qu'après l'ouverture des\r\nhostilités ou dans les deux mois qui l'ont précédée. Cela se serait\r\nappliqué notamment aux navires de commerce neutres qui seraient admis\r\npar un belligérant à une navigation réservée en temps de paix à la\r\nmarine nationale de ce belligérant--par exemple, au cabotage. Plusieurs\r\nDélégations ont repoussé formellement cette proposition, de sorte que\r\nla question ainsi soulevée est restée entière.\r\n\r\nArticle 47.\r\n\r\n_Tout individu incorporé dans la force armée de l'ennemi et qui sera\r\ntrouvé à bord d'un navire de commerce neutre, pourra être fait\r\nprisonnier de guerre, quand même il n'y aurait pas lieu de saisir ce\r\nnavire._\r\n\r\nDes individus incorporés dans les forces armées de terre ou de mer d'un\r\nbelligérant peuvent se trouver à bord d'un navire de commerce neutre\r\nvisité. Si le navire est sujet à confiscation, le croiseur le saisira et\r\nle conduira dans un de ses ports avec les personnes qui se trouvent à\r\nbord. Évidemment les militaires ou marins de l'État ennemi ne seront pas\r\nlaissés libres, mais seront considérés comme prisonniers de guerre. Il\r\npeut arriver que l'on ne soit pas dans le cas de saisir le navire--par\r\nexemple, parce que le capitaine ne connaissait pas la qualité d'un\r\nindividu qui s'était présenté comme un simple passager. Faut-il alors\r\nlaisser libre le ou les militaires qui sont sur le navire? Cela n'a pas\r\nparu admissible. Le croiseur belligérant ne peut être contraint de\r\nlaisser libres des ennemis actifs qui sont matériellement en son pouvoir\r\net qui sont plus dangereux que tels et tels articles de contrebande;\r\nnaturellement il doit agir avec une grande discrétion, et c'est sous sa\r\nresponsabilité qu'il exige la remise de ces individus, mais son droit\r\nexiste; aussi a-t-il été jugé nécessaire de s'expliquer sur ce point.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPITRE IV.--_De la destruction des prises neutres._\r\n\r\nLa destruction des prises neutres était à l'ordre du jour de la Deuxième\r\nConférence de la Paix et n'a pu y être réglée. Elle se retrouve à\r\nl'ordre du jour de la présente Conférence et, cette fois, un accord a\r\nété possible. Il y a lieu de s'applaudir d'un pareil résultat qui\r\ntémoigne d'un sincère désir d'entente de la part de tous. On a constaté\r\nici, une fois de plus, que des formules tranchantes et opposées ne\r\nrépondent pas toujours à la réalité et que, si on veut descendre dans le\r\ndétail et arriver aux applications précises, on aura souvent à peu près\r\nla même manière de faire, quoiqu'on ait paru se réclamer d'opinions tout\r\nà fait contraires. Pour s'accorder, il faut d'abord se bien comprendre,\r\nce qui n'est pas toujours le cas. Ainsi, on a constaté que ceux qui\r\nproclamaient le droit de détruire les prises neutres, ne prétendaient\r\npas user de ce droit capricieusement et à tout propos, mais seulement\r\nd'une manière exceptionnelle, et qu'à l'inverse, ceux qui affirmaient\r\nle principe de l'interdiction de la destruction, admettaient que ce\r\nprincipe devait céder dans des cas exceptionnels. Il s'agissait donc de\r\ns'entendre sur ces cas exceptionnels auxquels, dans les deux opinions,\r\ndevait se borner le droit de destruction. Ce n'était pas tout: il\r\nfallait aussi une garantie contre les abus dans l'exercice de ce droit;\r\nl'arbitraire dans l'appréciation des cas exceptionnels devait être\r\ndiminué au moyen d'une responsabilité effective imposée au capteur.\r\nC'est ici qu'est intervenu, dans le règlement de l'affaire, un élément\r\nnouveau, grâce auquel l'accord a pu se faire. L'intervention possible de\r\nla justice fera réfléchir le capteur en même temps qu'elle assurera une\r\nréparation dans le cas d'une destruction sans motif.\r\n\r\nTel est l'esprit général des dispositions de ce chapitre.\r\n\r\nArticle 48.\r\n\r\n_Un navire neutre saisi ne peut être détruit par le capteur, mais il\r\ndoit être conduit dans tel port qu'il appartiendra pour y être statué ce\r\nque de droit sur la validité de la capture._\r\n\r\nLe principe général est très simple. Un navire neutre saisi ne peut être\r\ndétruit par le capteur; cela peut être admis par tout le monde, quelle\r\nque soit la manière dont on envisage l'effet de la saisie. Le navire\r\ndoit être conduit dans un port pour y être statué sur la validité de la\r\nprise. Il sera ou non amariné suivant les cas.\r\n\r\nArticle 49.\r\n\r\n_Par exception, un navire neutre, saisi par un bâtiment belligérant et\r\nqui serait sujet à confiscation, peut être détruit, si l'observation de\r\nl'article 48 peut compromettre la sécurité du bâtiment de guerre ou le\r\nsuccès des opérations dans lesquelles celui-ci est actuellement engagé._\r\n\r\nLa première condition pour que le navire saisi puisse être détruit est\r\nqu'il soit susceptible de confiscation d'après les circonstances. Si le\r\ncapteur ne peut pas même songer à obtenir la confiscation du navire,\r\ncomment pourrait-il avoir la prétention de le détruire?\r\n\r\nLa seconde est que l'observation du principe général soit de nature à\r\ncompromettre la sécurité du bâtiment de guerre ou le succès des\r\nopérations dans lesquelles il est actuellement engagé. C'est la formule\r\nà laquelle on s'est arrêté après quelques tâtonnements. Il a été entendu\r\nque _compromettre la sécurité_ était synonyme de mettre en danger la\r\nnavire, et pourrait être traduit en anglais par _involve danger_. C'est\r\nnaturellement au moment où a lieu la destruction qu'il faut se placer\r\npour voir si les conditions sont ou non remplies. Le danger qui\r\nn'existait pas au moment même de la saisie peut s'être manifesté quelque\r\ntemps après.\r\n\r\nArticle 50.\r\n\r\n_Avant la destruction, les personnes qui se trouvent à bord devront être\r\nmises en sûreté, et tous les papiers de bord et autres pièces, que les\r\nintéressés estimeront utiles pour le jugement sur la validité de la\r\ncapture, devront être transbordés sur le bâtiment de guerre._\r\n\r\nLa disposition prévoit des précautions à prendre dans l'intérêt des\r\npersonnes et dans celui de l'administration de la justice.\r\n\r\nArticle 51.\r\n\r\n_Le capteur qui a détruit un navire neutre doit, préalablement à tout\r\njugement sur la validité de la capture, justifier en fait n'avoir agi\r\nqu'en présence d'une nécessité exceptionnelle, comme elle est prévue à\r\nl'article 49. Faute par lui de ce faire, il est tenu à indemnité\r\nvis-à-vis des intéressés, sans qu'il y ait à rechercher si la capture\r\nétait valable ou non._\r\n\r\nCe texte donne une garantie contre la destruction arbitraire des prises\r\npar l'établissement d'une responsabilité effective du capteur qui a\r\nopéré la destruction. Ce capteur doit, en effet, avant tout jugement sur\r\nla validité de la prise, justifier en fait qu'il était bien dans un des\r\ncas exceptionnels qui sont prévus. La justification sera faite\r\ncontradictoirement avec le neutre qui, s'il n'est pas content de la\r\ndécision du tribunal national des prises, pourra se pourvoir devant la\r\njuridiction internationale. Cette justification est donc une condition\r\npréalable à remplir par le capteur. S'il ne le fait pas, il doit\r\nindemniser les intéressés au navire et au chargement, sans qu'il y ait à\r\nrechercher si la prise était valable ou nulle. Il y a donc là une\r\nsanction sérieuse de l'obligation de ne détruire la prise que dans des\r\ncas déterminés, c'est une peine pécuniaire qui frappe le capteur. Si, au\r\ncontraire, la justification est faite, le procès de prise se suit comme\r\nà l'ordinaire; lorsque la prise est déclarée valable, aucune indemnité\r\nn'est due; quand elle est déclarée nulle, les intéressés ont droit à\r\nêtre indemnisés. Le recours devant la Cour Internationale ne peut être\r\nformé que quand la décision du tribunal des prises est intervenue sur le\r\nfond et non pas aussitôt après que la question préalable a été jugée.\r\n\r\nArticle 52.\r\n\r\n_Si la capture d'un navire neutre, dont la destruction a été justifiée,\r\nest ensuite déclarée nulle, le capteur doit indemniser les intéressés en\r\nremplacement de la restitution à laquelle ils auraient droit._\r\n\r\nArticle 53.\r\n\r\n_Si des marchandises neutres qui n'étaient pas susceptibles de\r\nconfiscation ont été détruites avec le navire, le propriétaire de ces\r\nmarchandises a droit à une indemnité._\r\n\r\nLe navire détruit contenait des marchandises neutres non susceptibles de\r\nconfiscation; le propriétaire de ces marchandises a, en tout cas, droit\r\nà une indemnité, c'est-à-dire sans qu'il y ait à distinguer suivant que\r\nla destruction était ou non justifiée. C'est équitable et c'est une\r\ngarantie de plus contre une destruction arbitraire.\r\n\r\nArticle 54.\r\n\r\n_Le capteur a la faculté d'exiger la remise ou de procéder à la\r\ndestruction des marchandises confiscables trouvées à bord d'un navire\r\nqui lui-même n'est pas sujet à confiscation, lorsque les circonstances\r\nsont telles que, d'après l'article 49, elles justifieraient la\r\ndestruction d'un navire passible de confiscation. Il mentionne les\r\nobjets livrés ou détruits sur le livre de bord du navire arrêté et se\r\nfait remettre par le capitaine copie certifiée conforme de tous papiers\r\nutiles. Lorsque la remise ou la destruction a été effectuée et que les\r\nformalités ont été remplies, le capitaine doit être autorisé à continuer\r\nsa route._\r\n\r\n_Les dispositions des articles 51 et 52 concernant la responsabilité du\r\ncapteur qui a détruit un navire neutre sont applicables._\r\n\r\nUn croiseur rencontre un navire de commerce neutre portant de la\r\ncontrebande dans une proportion inférieure à celle qui est prévue par\r\nl'article 40. Il peut amariner le navire et le conduire dans un port\r\npour y être jugé. Il peut, conformément à ce qui est réglé par l'article\r\n44, accepter la remise de la contrebande qui lui est offerte par le\r\nnavire arrêté. Mais, qu'arrivera-t-il si aucune de ces solutions\r\nn'intervient? Le navire arrêté n'offre pas de remettre la contrebande et\r\nle croiseur n'est pas en situation de conduire le navire dans un de ses\r\nports. Le croiseur est-il obligé de laisser aller un navire neutre avec\r\nla contrebande qu'il porte? Cela a paru excessif, au moins dans\r\ncertaines circonstances exceptionnelles. Ce sont celles-là mêmes qui\r\njustifieraient la destruction du navire, s'il était susceptible de\r\nconfiscation. En pareil cas, le croiseur pourra exiger la remise ou\r\nprocéder à la destruction des marchandises confiscables. Les raisons qui\r\nont fait admettre la destruction du navire pourront justifier la\r\ndestruction des marchandises de contrebande, d'autant plus que les\r\nconsidérations d'humanité qui peuvent être invoquées en cas de\r\ndestruction du navire sont écartées ici. Contre une exigence arbitraire\r\ndu croiseur, il y a les mêmes garanties qui ont permis de reconnaître\r\nla faculté de détruire le navire. Le croiseur doit préalablement\r\njustifier qu'il se trouvait bien dans les circonstances exceptionnelles\r\nprévues; sinon, il est condamné à la valeur des marchandises livrées ou\r\ndétruites, sans qu'il y ait à rechercher si elles constituaient ou non\r\nde la contrebande de guerre.\r\n\r\nLa disposition prescrit des formalités qui sont nécessaires pour\r\nconstater le fait même et pour mettre la juridiction des prises à même\r\nde statuer.\r\n\r\nNaturellement, une fois que la remise a été effectuée ou que la\r\ndestruction a été opérée et que les formalités ont été remplies, le\r\nnavire arrêté doit être laissé libre de continuer sa route.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPITRE V.--_Du transfert de pavillon._\r\n\r\nUn navire de commerce ennemi est sujet à capture, tandis qu'un navire de\r\ncommerce neutre est respecté. On comprend, dès lors, qu'un croiseur\r\nbelligérant, rencontrant un navire de commerce qui se réclame d'une\r\nnationalité neutre, ait à rechercher si cette nationalité a été\r\nlégitimement acquise ou si elle n'a pas eu pour but de soustraire le\r\nnavire aux risques auxquels il aurait été exposé s'il avait gardé son\r\nancienne nationalité. La question se présente naturellement quand le\r\ntransfert est de date relativement récente, au moment où a lieu la\r\nvisite, que ce transfert soit, du reste, antérieur ou postérieur à\r\nl'ouverture des hostilités. Elle est résolue différemment suivant qu'on\r\nse place plutôt au point de vue de l'intérêt du commerce ou plutôt au\r\npoint de vue de l'intérêt des belligérants. Il est heureux que l'on se\r\nsoit entendu sur un règlement qui concilie les deux intérêts dans la\r\nmesure du possible et qui renseigne les belligérants et le commerce\r\nneutre.\r\n\r\nArticle 55.\r\n\r\n_La transfert sous pavillon neutre d'un navire ennemi, effectué avant\r\nl'ouverture des hostilités, est valable à moins qu'il soit établi que ce\r\ntransfert a été effectué en vue d'éluder les conséquences qu'entraîne le\r\ncaractère de navire ennemi. Il y a néanmoins présomption de nullité si\r\nl'acte de transfert ne se trouve pas à bord, alors que le navire a perdu\r\nla nationalité belligérante moins de soixante jours avant l'ouverture\r\ndes hostilités; la preuve contraire est admise._\r\n\r\n_Il y a présomption absolue de validité d'un transfert effectué plus de\r\ntrente jours avant l'ouverture des hostilités, s'il est absolu, complet,\r\nconforme à la législation des pays intéressés, et s'il a cet effet que_\r\n_le contrôle du navire et le bénéfice de son emploi ne restent pas entre\r\nles mêmes mains qu'avant le transfert. Toutefois, si le navire a perdu\r\nla nationalité belligérante moins de soixante jours avant l'ouverture\r\ndes hostilités et si l'acte de transfert ne se trouve pas à bord, la\r\nsaisie du navire ne pourra donner lieu à des dommages et intérêts._\r\n\r\nLa règle générale, posée par l'alinéa 1'er, est que le transfert sous\r\npavillon neutre d'un navire ennemi est valable, en supposant, bien\r\nentendu, que les conditions juridiques ordinaires de validité ont été\r\nremplies. C'est au capteur, s'il veut faire annuler ce transfert, à\r\nétablir que le transfert a eu pour but d'éluder les conséquences de la\r\nguerre que l'on prévoyait. Il y a un cas considéré comme suspect, celui\r\ndans lequel l'acte de transfert ne se trouve pas à bord, alors que le\r\nnavire a changé de nationalité moins de soixante jours avant l'ouverture\r\ndes hostilités. La présomption de validité établie au profit du navire\r\npar l'alinéa 1'er est renversée au profit du capteur. Il y a présomption\r\nde nullité du transfert, mais la preuve contraire est admise. Il peut\r\nêtre prouvé, pour l'écarter, que le transfert n'a pas été opéré en vue\r\nd'éluder les conséquences de la guerre; il va sans dire que les\r\nconditions juridiques ordinaires de validité doivent avoir été remplies.\r\n\r\nOn a voulu donner au commerce cette garantie que le droit de faire\r\nconsidérer un transfert comme nul pour ce motif qu'il aurait eu pour but\r\nd'éluder les conséquences de la guerre ne s'étendrait pas trop loin et\r\nne comprendrait pas une période trop étendue. En conséquence, si le\r\ntransfert a été effectué plus de trente jours avant l'ouverture des\r\nhostilités, il ne peut être attaqué pour cette seule cause, et il est\r\nconsidéré comme absolument valable, s'il a été fait dans des conditions\r\nqui en démontrent le caractère sérieux et définitif et qui sont les\r\nsuivantes: le transfert doit être absolu, complet, et conforme à la\r\nlégislation des pays intéressés et il a pour effet de mettre le contrôle\r\net les bénéfices du navire entre d'autres mains. Ces conditions\r\nétablies, le capteur n'est pas admis à prétendre que le vendeur\r\nprévoyait la guerre dans laquelle son pays allait être engagé et\r\nvoulait, par la vente, se soustraire aux risques qu'elle lui aurait fait\r\ncourir pour les navires dont il opérait le transfert. Si, même dans\r\ncette hypothèse, le navire est rencontré par un croiseur et qu'il n'ait\r\npas l'acte de transfert à bord, il pourra être saisi lorsque le\r\nchangement de nationalité a eu lieu moins de soixante jours avant\r\nl'ouverture des hostilités; cette circonstance le rend suspect. Mais\r\nsi, devant la juridiction des prises, il fait les justifications\r\nprévues par l'alinéa 2, il doit être relâché; seulement il ne pourra\r\nobtenir des dommages et intérêts, attendu qu'il y avait eu motif\r\nsuffisant pour saisir le navire.\r\n\r\nArticle 56.\r\n\r\n_Le transfert sous pavillon neutre d'un navire ennemi, effectué après\r\nl'ouverture des hostilités, est nul, à moins qu'il soit établi que ce\r\ntransfert n'a pas été effectué en vue d'éluder les conséquences\r\nqu'entraîne le caractère de navire ennemi._\r\n\r\n_Toutefois, il y a présomption absolue de nullité:_\r\n\r\n  1'o _Si le transfert a été effectué pendant que le navire est en\r\n  voyage ou dans un port bloqué._\r\n\r\n  2'o _S'il y a faculté de réméré ou de retour._\r\n\r\n  3'o _Si les conditions, auxquelles est soumis le droit de pavillon\r\n  d'après la législation du pavillon arboré, n'ont pas été\r\n  observées._\r\n\r\nPour le _transfert postérieur à l'ouverture des hostilités_, la règle\r\nest plus simple: le transfert n'est valable que s'il est établi qu'il\r\nn'a pas eu pour but d'éluder les conséquences qu'entraîne le caractère\r\nde navire ennemi. C'est la solution inverse de celle qui est admise pour\r\nle transfert antérieur à l'ouverture des hostilités; présomption de\r\nvalidité dans ce dernier, présomption de nullité dans celui dont il\r\ns'agit maintenant, sauf la possibilité de faire la preuve contraire. Il\r\npourrait être établi, par exemple, que le transfert est la suite d'une\r\ntransmission héréditaire.\r\n\r\nL'article 56 indique des cas dans lesquels la présomption de nullité est\r\nabsolue pour des motifs qui se comprennent aisément: dans le premier, le\r\nlien entre le transfert et le risque de guerre couru par le navire\r\napparaît clairement; dans le second, l'acquéreur se présente comme un\r\nprête-nom devant être considéré comme propriétaire du navire pendant une\r\npériode dangereuse, après laquelle le vendeur reprendra son navire;\r\nenfin, le troisième cas aurait pu à la rigueur être sous-entendu, le\r\nnavire qui se réclame d'une nationalité neutre devant naturellement\r\njustifier qu'il a droit à cette nationalité.\r\n\r\nOn avait d'abord prévu le cas où le navire est, après le transfert,\r\nmaintenu dans le service auquel il était affecté auparavant. Il y a là\r\nune circonstance suspecte au plus haut point; le transfert paraît\r\nfictif, puisque rien n'est changé dans le service du navire. Cela\r\ns'applique, par exemple, au cas d'une même ligne de navigation desservie\r\npar le navire après et avant le transfert. On a objecté que, parfois, la\r\nprésomption absolue serait trop rigoureuse, que certains navires, comme\r\nles navires pétroliers, ne pouvaient, à raison de leur construction,\r\nêtre affectés qu'à un service déterminé. Pour tenir compte de cette\r\nobservation, le mot _trajet_ avait été ajouté, de sorte qu'il aurait\r\nfallu que le navire eût été maintenu _dans les mêmes service et trajet_;\r\nil semblait que l'on donnait, de cette façon, une satisfaction\r\nsuffisante à la réclamation. Néanmoins, sur une insistance en vue de la\r\nsuppression du cas dans l'énumération, cette suppression a été admise.\r\nIl en résulte que le transfert rentre alors dans l'application de la\r\nrègle générale; il est bien présumé nul, mais la preuve contraire est\r\nadmise.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPITRE VI.--_Du caractère ennemi._\r\n\r\nLa règle inscrite dans la Déclaration de Paris, \"le pavillon neutre\r\ncouvre la marchandise ennemie, à l'exception de la contrebande de\r\nguerre,\" répond trop au progrès des moeurs, a trop pénétré l'opinion\r\npublique pour qu'en présence d'une application si générale, on n'y voie\r\npas un principe de droit commun, qu'il n'est plus même question de\r\ndiscuter. Aussi le caractère neutre ou ennemi des navires de commerce\r\nn'a-t-il pas seulement pour conséquence de décider de la validité de\r\nleur capture, mais encore du sort des marchandises, autres que la\r\ncontrebande, qui sont trouvées à leur bord. Une remarque générale\r\nanalogue peut être faite au sujet du caractère neutre ou ennemi de la\r\nmarchandise. Personne ne songe à contester aujourd'hui le principe\r\nd'après lequel, \"la marchandise neutre, à l'exception de la contrebande\r\nde guerre, n'est pas saisissable sous pavillon ennemi.\" Ce n'est donc\r\nque dans le cas où elle est trouvée à bord d'un navire ennemi, que se\r\npose la question de savoir si une marchandise est neutre ou ennemie.\r\n\r\nLa détermination du caractère neutre ou ennemi apparaît ainsi comme le\r\ndéveloppement des deux principes consacrés en 1856, ou mieux comme le\r\nmoyen d'en assurer la juste application pratique.\r\n\r\nL'utilité de dégager, à cet égard, des pratiques des différents pays des\r\nrègles claires et simples n'a, pour ainsi dire, pas besoin d'être\r\ndémontrée. Pour le commerce, l'incertitude des risques de capture, si\r\nelle n'est pas une cause d'arrêt total, est tout au moins la pire des\r\nentraves. Le commerçant doit savoir les risques qu'il court en chargeant\r\nsur tel ou tel navire; l'assureur, s'il ignore la gravité de ces\r\nrisques, est forcé d'exiger des primes de guerre souvent exorbitantes ou\r\ninsuffisantes.\r\n\r\nLes règles qui forment ce chapitre ne sont malheureusement pas\r\ncomplètes; quelques points importants ont dû être laissés de côté,\r\ncomme on l'a déjà vu par ce qui a été dit dans les explications\r\npréliminaires et comme cela sera précisé plus loin.\r\n\r\nArticle 57.\r\n\r\n_Sous réserve des dispositions relatives au transfert de pavillon, le\r\ncaractère neutre ou ennemi du navire est déterminé par le pavillon qu'il\r\na le droit de porter._\r\n\r\n_Le cas où le navire neutre se livre à une navigation réservée en temps\r\nde paix reste hors de cause et n'est nullement visé par cette règle._\r\n\r\nLe principe est donc que _le caractère neutre ou ennemi du navire est\r\ndéterminé par le pavillon qu'il a le droit de porter_. C'est une règle\r\nsimple qui paraît bien répondre à la situation spéciale des navires, si\r\non les compare aux autres biens meubles et notamment aux marchandises. A\r\nplus d'un point de vue, ils ont une sorte d'individualité; notamment ils\r\nont une nationalité, un _caractère_ national. Cette nationalité est\r\nmanifestée par le droit de pavillon; elle place les navires sous la\r\nprotection et le contrôle de l'État dont ils relèvent; elle les soumet à\r\nla souveraineté et aux lois de cet État et, le cas échéant, à ses\r\nréquisitions. C'est là le critérium le plus sûr que le navire est bien\r\nun des éléments de la force maritime marchande d'un pays et, par\r\nconséquent, le meilleur critérium pour déterminer s'il est neutre ou\r\nennemi. Aussi convient-il de s'y attacher exclusivement et d'écarter ce\r\nqui se rattache à la personnalité du propriétaire.\r\n\r\nLe texte dit: le pavillon que le navire a le _droit de porter_; cela\r\ns'entend naturellement du pavillon que le navire est, s'il ne l'a fait,\r\nen droit d'arborer, conformément aux lois qui régissent le port de ce\r\npavillon.\r\n\r\nL'article 57 réserve les dispositions relatives au transfert de pavillon\r\npour lesquelles il suffit de renvoyer aux articles 55 et 56; il pourra\r\nse faire qu'un navire ait bien le droit de porter un pavillon neutre, au\r\npoint de vue de la législation du pays dont il se réclame, mais soit\r\nconsidéré comme ennemi par un belligérant, parce que le transfert à la\r\nsuite duquel il a porté le pavillon neutre tombe sous le coup de\r\nl'article 55 ou de l'article 56.\r\n\r\nEnfin, la question de savoir si un navire perd son caractère neutre,\r\nlorsqu'il effectue une navigation que l'ennemi réservait avant la guerre\r\naux seuls navires nationaux a été soulevée. Une entente n'a pu avoir\r\nlieu, comme cela a été expliqué plus haut à propos du chapitre sur\r\n_l'Assistance hostile_, et la question est restée absolument entière,\r\ncomme l'alinéa 2 de l'article 57 prend soin de le dire.\r\n\r\nArticle 58.\r\n\r\n_Le caractère neutre ou ennemi des marchandises trouvées à bord d'un\r\nnavire ennemi est déterminé par le caractère neutre ou ennemi de leur\r\npropriétaire._\r\n\r\nA la différence des navires, les marchandises n'ont pas une\r\nindividualité propre; on fait dépendre leur caractère neutre ou ennemi\r\nde la personnalité de leur propriétaire. C'est ce qui a prévalu après un\r\nexamen approfondi de diverses opinions tendant à s'attacher à l'origine\r\ndes marchandises, à la personne du porteur de risques, du réclamateur ou\r\nde l'expéditeur. Le critérium adopté par l'article 58 paraît,\r\nd'ailleurs, conforme aux termes de la Déclaration de Paris comme à ceux\r\nde la Convention de La Haye du 18 octobre 1907, sur l'établissement\r\nd'une Cour Internationale des prises, où il est parlé des _propriétés\r\nneutres ou ennemies_ (articles 1, 3, 4 et 8).\r\n\r\nMais il ne faut pas se dissimuler que l'article 58 ne résout qu'une\r\npartie du problème, la plus simple; c'est le caractère neutre ou ennemi\r\ndu propriétaire qui détermine le caractère des marchandises, mais à quoi\r\ns'attachera-t-on pour déterminer le caractère neutre ou ennemi du\r\npropriétaire? On ne le dit pas, parce qu'il a été impossible d'arriver à\r\nune entente sur ce point. Les opinions ont été partagées entre le\r\n_domicile_ et la _nationalité_; il est inutile de reproduire ici les\r\narguments invoqués dans les deux sens. On avait pensé à une sorte de\r\ntransaction ainsi formulée:\r\n\r\n  \"Le caractère neutre ou ennemi des marchandises trouvées à bord\r\n  d'un navire ennemi est déterminé par la nationalité neutre ou\r\n  ennemie de leur propriétaire et, en cas d'absence de nationalité\r\n  ou en cas de double nationalité neutre et ennemie de leur\r\n  propriétaire, par le domicile de celui-ci en pays neutre ou\r\n  ennemi.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Toutefois, les marchandises appartenant à une société anonyme ou\r\n  par actions sont considérées comme neutres ou ennemies selon que\r\n  la société a son siège social en pays neutre ou ennemi.\"\r\n\r\nL'unanimité n'a pu être obtenue.\r\n\r\nArticle 59.\r\n\r\n_Si le caractère neutre de la marchandise trouvée à bord d'un navire\r\nennemi n'est pas établi, la marchandise est présumée ennemie._\r\n\r\nL'article 59 formule la règle traditionnelle d'après laquelle la\r\nmarchandise trouvée à bord d'un navire ennemi est présumée ennemie sauf\r\nla preuve contraire; ce n'est qu'une présomption simple laissant au\r\nrevendiquant le droit, mais la charge de prouver ses droits.\r\n\r\nArticle 60.\r\n\r\n_Le caractère ennemi de la marchandise chargée à bord d'un navire ennemi\r\nsubsiste jusqu'à l'arrivée à destination, nonobstant un transfert\r\nintervenu pendant le cours de l'expédition, après l'ouverture des\r\nhostilités._\r\n\r\n_Toutefois, si, antérieurement à la capture, un précédent propriétaire\r\nneutre exerce, en cas de faillite du propriétaire ennemi actuel, un\r\ndroit de revendication légale sur la marchandise, celle-ci reprend le\r\ncaractère neutre._\r\n\r\nCette disposition envisage le cas où une marchandise, étant propriété\r\nennemie au moment de son départ, a été l'objet d'une vente ou d'un\r\ntransfert pendant le cours du voyage. La facilité qu'il y aurait à\r\ngarantir, au moyen d'une vente, la marchandise ennemie contre l'exercice\r\ndu droit de capture, sauf à s'en faire rétrocéder la propriété à\r\nl'arrivée, a toujours conduit à ne pas tenir compte de ces transferts;\r\nle caractère ennemi subsiste.\r\n\r\nAu point de vue du moment à partir duquel une marchandise doit être\r\nconsidérée comme devant prendre et conserver le caractère ennemi de son\r\npropriétaire, le texte est inspiré du même esprit d'équité qui a présidé\r\nà la Convention de La Haye sur le régime des bâtiments de commerce au\r\ndébut des hostilités, et du même désir de garantir les opérations\r\nentreprises dans la confiance du temps de paix. C'est seulement lorsque\r\nle transfert a lieu après l'ouverture des hostilités qu'il est, jusqu'à\r\nl'arrivée, inopérant au point de vue de la perte du caractère ennemi. Ce\r\nqu'on considère ici, c'est la date du transfert, et non la date du\r\ndépart du navire. Car, bien que le navire parti avant la guerre, et\r\nresté peut-être dans l'ignorance de l'ouverture des hostilités, jouisse\r\nde ce chef d'une certaine exemption, la marchandise peut cependant avoir\r\nle caractère ennemi; le propriétaire ennemi de cette marchandise est à\r\nmême de connaître la guerre, et c'est précisément pour cela qu'il\r\ncherchera à échapper à ses conséquences.\r\n\r\nOn a cru, toutefois, devoir ajouter sinon une restriction, du moins un\r\ncomplément jugé nécessaire. Dans un grand nombre de pays, le vendeur non\r\npayé a, en cas de faillite de l'acheteur, un droit de revendication\r\nlégale (_stoppage in transitu_) sur les marchandises déjà devenues la\r\npropriété de l'acheteur, mais non encore parvenues jusqu'à lui. En\r\npareil cas la vente est résolue, et, par l'effet de sa revendication, le\r\nvendeur reprend sa marchandise, sans être réputé avoir jamais cessé\r\nd'être propriétaire. Il y a là pour le commerce neutre, en cas de\r\nfaillite non simulée, une garantie trop précieuse pour être sacrifiée,\r\net le deuxième alinéa de l'article 60 a pour but de la sauvegarder.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPITRE VII.--_Du convoi._\r\n\r\nLa pratique du convoi a, dans le passé, soulevé parfois de graves\r\ndifficultés et même des conflits. Aussi peut-on constater avec\r\nsatisfaction l'accord intervenu pour la régler.\r\n\r\nArticle 61.\r\n\r\n_Les navires neutres sous convoi de leur pavillon sont exempts de\r\nvisite. Le commandant du convoi donne par écrit, à la demande du\r\ncommandant d'un bâtiment de guerre belligérant, sur le caractère des\r\nnavires et sur leur chargement, toutes informations que la visite\r\nservirait à obtenir._\r\n\r\nLe principe posé est simple: un navire neutre convoyé par un navire de\r\nguerre de sa nation est exempt de visite. Le motif en est que le\r\ncroiseur belligérant doit trouver dans les affirmations du commandant du\r\nconvoi la garantie que lui procurerait l'exercice même du droit de\r\nvisite; il ne peut, en effet, révoquer en doute ces affirmations,\r\ndonnées par l'agent officiel d'un Gouvernement neutre, sans manquer à la\r\ncourtoisie internationale. Si les Gouvernements neutres laissent les\r\nbelligérants visiter les navires portant leur pavillon, c'est qu'ils ne\r\nveulent pas prendre la charge de la surveillance de ces navires, et\r\nqu'alors ils permettent aux belligérants de se protéger eux-mêmes. La\r\nsituation change quand un Gouvernement neutre entend prendre cette\r\ncharge; le droit de visite n'a plus la même raison d'être.\r\n\r\nMais il résulte de l'explication de la règle donnée pour le convoi que\r\nle Gouvernement neutre s'engage à donner aux belligérants toute garantie\r\nque les navires convoyés ne profitent pas de la protection qui leur est\r\nassurée pour agir contrairement à la neutralité--par exemple, pour\r\ntransporter de la contrebande de guerre, pour fournir à un belligérant\r\nune assistance hostile, pour tenter de violer un blocus. Il faudra donc\r\nune surveillance sérieuse exercée au départ sur les navires devant être\r\nconvoyés, et cette surveillance devra se poursuivre au cours du voyage.\r\nLe Gouvernement devra procéder avec vigilance pour empêcher tout abus du\r\nconvoi, et il donnera en ce sens des instructions précises à l'officier\r\nchargé de commander un convoi.\r\n\r\nUn croiseur belligérant rencontre un convoi: il s'adresse au commandant\r\nde ce convoi, qui doit, sur sa demande, lui donner par écrit toutes les\r\ninformations utiles sur les navires qui sont sous sa protection. On\r\nexige une déclaration écrite, parce qu'elle empêche les équivoques et\r\nles malentendus, qu'elle engage plus la responsabilité du commandant.\r\nCette déclaration a pour but de rendre la visite inutile par le fait\r\nmême qu'elle procure au croiseur les renseignements que la visite\r\nelle-même lui aurait fournis.\r\n\r\nArticle 62.\r\n\r\n_Si le commandant du bâtiment de guerre belligérant a lieu de soupçonner\r\nque la religion du commandant du convoi a été surprise, il lui\r\ncommunique ses soupçons. C'est au commandant du convoi seul qu'il\r\nappartient en ce cas de procéder à une vérification. Il doit constater\r\nle résultat de cette vérification par un procès-verbal dont une copie\r\nest remise à l'officier du bâtiment de guerre. Si des faits ainsi\r\nconstatés justifient, dans l'opinion du commandant du convoi, la saisie\r\nd'un ou de plusieurs navires, la protection du convoi doit leur être\r\nretirée._\r\n\r\nLe plus souvent le croiseur s'en tiendra à la déclaration que lui aura\r\ndonnée le commandant du convoi, mais il peut avoir de sérieuses raisons\r\nde croire que la religion de ce commandant a été surprise, qu'un navire\r\nconvoyé dont les papiers paraissent en règle, et ne présentent rien de\r\nsuspect, transporte, en fait, de la contrebande adroitement dissimulée.\r\nLe croiseur peut communiquer ses soupçons au commandant du convoi. Une\r\nvérification peut être jugée nécessaire. Elle est faite par le\r\ncommandant du convoi; c'est lui seul qui exerce l'autorité sur les\r\nnavires placés sous sa protection. Il a paru toutefois que l'on\r\néviterait souvent bien des difficultés, s'il était permis au belligérant\r\nd'assister à cette vérification; autrement il lui serait toujours\r\npossible de suspecter, sinon la bonne foi, du moins la vigilance ou la\r\nperspicacité du visiteur. Mais on n'a pas cru devoir imposer au\r\ncommandant du convoi l'obligation de laisser l'officier du croiseur\r\nassister à la vérification. Il agira comme il le jugera bon: s'il\r\naccepte l'assistance d'un officier du croiseur, ce sera un acte de\r\ncourtoisie ou de bonne politique. Il devra, dans tous les cas, dresser\r\nun procès-verbal de la vérification et en donner une copie à l'officier\r\ndu croiseur.\r\n\r\nDes divergences peuvent s'élever entre les deux officiers, spécialement\r\nà propos de la contrebande conditionnelle. Le caractère du port auquel\r\nsont destinés des blés peut être contesté; est-ce un port de commerce\r\nordinaire? est-ce un port qui sert de base de ravitaillement pour les\r\nforces armées? La situation de fait produite par le convoi doit être, en\r\nce cas, maintenue. Il pourra seulement y avoir une protestation de la\r\npart de l'officier du croiseur, et la difficulté sera réglée par la voie\r\ndiplomatique.\r\n\r\nLa situation est tout autre si un navire convoyé est trouvé porteur de\r\ncontrebande sans qu'une contestation puisse s'élever. Le navire n'a plus\r\ndroit à la protection, parce que la condition à laquelle cette\r\nprotection était subordonnée n'a pas été remplie. Il a trompé son propre\r\nGouvernement d'abord et essayé de tromper un belligérant. Il doit alors\r\nêtre traité comme un navire de commerce neutre qui, dans les\r\ncirconstances ordinaires, rencontre un croiseur belligérant et est\r\nvisité par lui. Il ne peut se plaindre d'être ainsi traité\r\nrigoureusement, parce qu'il y a dans son cas une aggravation de la faute\r\ncommise par un transporteur de contrebande.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPITRE VIII.--_De la résistance à la visite._\r\n\r\nLe sujet traité dans ce chapitre n'est pas mentionné dans le programme\r\nsoumis en février 1908 par le Gouvernement Britannique; il se rattache\r\nétroitement à plusieurs des questions de ce programme, aussi s'est-il\r\nnaturellement présenté à l'esprit au cours des discussions, et il a paru\r\nnécessaire de poser une règle sur laquelle on s'est facilement accordé.\r\n\r\nUn croiseur belligérant rencontre un navire de commerce et le somme de\r\ns'arrêter pour qu'il soit procédé à la visite. Le navire sommé ne\r\ns'arrête pas et essaie de se soustraire à la visite par la fuite. Le\r\ncroiseur peut employer la force pour l'arrêter, et le navire de\r\ncommerce, s'il est avarié ou coulé, n'a pas le droit de se plaindre,\r\npuisqu'il a contrevenu à une obligation imposée par le droit des gens.\r\nS'il est arrêté et s'il est établi que c'est seulement pour éviter les\r\nennuis de la visite qu'il avait recouru à la fuite, qu'il n'avait\r\nd'ailleurs commis aucun acte contraire à la neutralité, il ne sera pas\r\npuni pour sa tentative. S'il est constaté, au contraire, que le navire a\r\nde la contrebande à bord ou qu'il a, d'une façon quelconque, violé ses\r\ndevoirs de neutre, il subira les conséquences de son infraction à la\r\nneutralité, mais il ne subira non plus aucune peine pour avoir tenté la\r\nfuite. Certains pensaient, au contraire, que le navire devrait être puni\r\npour une tentative de fuite caractérisée comme pour une résistance\r\nviolente. La possibilité de la confiscation engagerait, disait-on, le\r\ncroiseur à ménager, dans la mesure du possible, le navire en fuite. Mais\r\ncette idée n'a pas prévalu.\r\n\r\nArticle 63.\r\n\r\n_La résistance opposée par la force à l'exercice légitime du droit\r\nd'arrêt, de visite et de saisie, entraîne, dans tous les cas, la\r\nconfiscation du navire. Le chargement est passible du même traitement\r\nque subirait le chargement d'un navire ennemi; les marchandises\r\nappartenant au capitaine ou au propriétaire du navire sont considérées\r\ncomme marchandises ennemies._\r\n\r\nLa situation est différente s'il y a résistance violente à l'action\r\nlégitime du croiseur. Le navire commet un acte d'hostilité et doit, dès\r\nlors, être traité en ennemi; il sera donc soumis à confiscation, quand\r\nmême la visite ne révélerait aucun fait contraire à la neutralité, et\r\ncela semble ne pouvoir soulever aucune difficulté.\r\n\r\nQue faut-il décider du chargement? La formule qui a semblé la meilleure\r\nest celle d'après laquelle ce chargement sera traité comme celui qui\r\nserait à bord d'un navire ennemi. Cette assimilation entraîne les\r\nconséquences suivantes: le navire neutre qui a résisté devenant navire\r\nennemi, la marchandise se trouvant à bord est présumée ennemie. Les\r\nneutres intéressés pourront réclamer leur propriété, conformément à la\r\n3'e règle de la Déclaration de Paris, mais la marchandise ennemie sera\r\nconfisquée parce que la règle _le pavillon couvre la marchandise_ ne\r\npeut plus être invoquée, le navire saisi sur lequel elle se trouve étant\r\nconsidéré comme ennemi. On remarquera que le droit de réclamer la\r\nmarchandise est reconnu à tous les neutres, même à ceux qui ont la\r\nnationalité du navire saisi; il paraîtrait excessif de les faire\r\nsouffrir de l'acte du capitaine. Il y a toutefois une exception à\r\nl'égard des marchandises appartenant au propriétaire du navire. Il\r\nsemble naturel qu'il supporte les conséquences des actes de son agent.\r\nSa propriété à bord du navire sera donc traitée en marchandise ennemie.\r\nA plus forte raison, en est-il de même de la marchandise appartenant au\r\ncapitaine.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPITRE IX.--_Des dommages et intérêts._\r\n\r\nCe chapitre a une portée très générale, puisque la disposition qu'il\r\ncontient trouve son application dans les cas nombreux où un croiseur\r\npeut saisir un navire ou des marchandises.\r\n\r\nArticle 64.\r\n\r\n_Si la saisie du navire ou des marchandises n'est pas validée par la\r\njuridiction des prises ou si, sans qu'il y ait eu de mise en jugement,\r\nla saisie n'est pas maintenue, les intéressés ont droit à des dommages\r\net intérêts, à moins qu'il y ait eu des motifs suffisants de saisir le\r\nnavire ou les marchandises._\r\n\r\nUn croiseur a saisi un navire neutre, par exemple, pour transport de\r\ncontrebande ou violation de blocus. Le tribunal des prises relâche le\r\nnavire en annulant la saisie. Cela ne suffit évidemment pas à dédommager\r\nles intéressés de la perte éprouvée par suite de la saisie, et cette\r\nperte a pu être considérable, puisque le navire a été, pendant un temps\r\nsouvent très long, empêché de se livrer à son trafic ordinaire.\r\nPeuvent-ils demander à être indemnisés de ce préjudice? Rationnellement\r\nil faut admettre l'affirmative, si ce préjudice est immérité,\r\nc'est-à-dire si la saisie n'a pas été amenée par leur faute. Il peut\r\narriver, en effet, que la saisie ait été motivée, parce que le capitaine\r\ndu navire visité n'a pas produit des justifications qui devaient se\r\ntrouver normalement à sa disposition et qui ont été fournies plus tard.\r\nDans ce cas, il serait injuste que des dommages et intérêts fussent\r\naccordés. A l'inverse, s'il y a eu vraiment faute du croiseur, s'il a\r\nsaisi dans un cas où il n'y avait pas de motifs suffisants de le faire,\r\nil est juste que des dommages et intérêts soient alloués.\r\n\r\nIl peut arriver aussi qu'un navire saisi et conduit dans un port ait été\r\nrelaxé par voie administrative sans intervention d'un tribunal de\r\nprises. En pareil cas, la pratique varie: dans certains pays, la\r\njuridiction des prises n'intervient que dans le cas d'une capture et ne\r\npourrait statuer sur une demande de dommages-intérêts fondée sur ce que\r\nla saisie aurait été injustifiée; dans d'autres, la juridiction des\r\nprises serait compétente pour une demande de ce genre. Il y a là une\r\ninégalité peu équitable et il convient d'établir une règle qui produise\r\nle même effet dans tous les pays. Il est raisonnable que toute saisie\r\npratiquée sans motifs suffisants donne droit à des dommages-intérêts au\r\nprofit des intéressés, sans qu'il y ait à distinguer suivant que la\r\nsaisie a été ou non suivie d'une décision du tribunal des prises, et\r\nd'autant plus que c'est quand la saisie aura été le moins justifiée, que\r\nle navire pourra être relaxé par voie administrative. On a donc employé\r\nune formule générale pouvant comprendre tous les cas de saisie.\r\n\r\nIl convient de remarquer que la question de savoir si les tribunaux\r\nnationaux de prises sont compétents pour statuer sur les\r\ndommages-intérêts n'est pas visée dans le texte. En tant qu'il y a un\r\nprocès sur les propriétés saisies, aucun doute n'est possible. Dans la\r\nprocédure engagée sur la validité de la capture, les intéressés auront\r\nl'occasion de faire valoir leur droit à une indemnité, et, si la\r\ndécision du tribunal national ne leur donne pas satisfaction, ils\r\npourront se pourvoir devant la Cour Internationale des prises. Si, au\r\ncontraire, l'action du belligérant s'est bornée à une saisie, la\r\nlégislation du belligérant capteur décide si des tribunaux sont\r\ncompétents pour connaître d'une demande en indemnité et, en cas\r\nd'affirmative, quels tribunaux sont compétents dans l'espèce; la Cour\r\nInternationale n'a, dans ce cas, aucune compétence d'après la Convention\r\nde La Haye. Au point de vue international, la voie diplomatique est la\r\nseule ouverte pour faire valoir la réclamation, qu'il s'agisse de se\r\nplaindre d'une décision effectivement rendue ou de suppléer à l'absence\r\nde juridiction.\r\n\r\nOn a posé la question de savoir s'il y avait lieu de distinguer les\r\ndommages directs et les dommages indirects subis par le navire ou la\r\nmarchandise. Il a semblé qu'il valait mieux laisser la juridiction des\r\nprises libre d'apprécier le dédommagement dû, qui variera suivant les\r\ncirconstances et dont le montant ne peut être déterminé à l'avance par\r\ndes règles trop minutieuses.\r\n\r\nIl n'a été parlé que du navire pour simplifier; mais ce qui a été dit\r\ns'applique naturellement à la cargaison saisie, puis relâchée. Ainsi la\r\nmarchandise innocente, se trouvant à bord du navire saisi, subit tous\r\nles inconvénients de la saisie du navire. S'il y a eu des motifs\r\nsuffisants de saisir le navire, que cette saisie soit maintenue ou non,\r\nles propriétaires de la cargaison n'ont aucun droit à des dommages et\r\nintérêts.\r\n\r\nIl peut être utile d'indiquer certains cas dans lesquels la saisie du\r\nnavire serait justifiée, quelle que pût être la décision du tribunal des\r\nprises. C'est notamment celui de jet, de suppression ou de destruction\r\nvolontaire de tout ou partie des papiers de bord, provenant du fait du\r\ncapitaine, de quelqu'un de l'équipage ou des passagers. Il y a là\r\nquelque chose qui justifie tous les soupçons et qui explique que le\r\nnavire soit saisi, sauf au capitaine à rendre compte de sa conduite\r\ndevant le tribunal des prises. Même si ce tribunal acceptait les\r\nexplications données et ne trouvait pas de causes suffisantes de\r\nconfiscation, les intéressés ne pourraient songer à réclamer des\r\ndommages-intérêts.\r\n\r\nUn cas analogue serait celui où l'on trouverait à bord des papiers\r\ndoubles, faux, ou falsifiés, alors que cette irrégularité se rattache à\r\ndes circonstances de nature à influer sur la saisie du navire.\r\n\r\nIl a semblé suffisant que ces cas où la saisie s'expliquerait\r\nraisonnablement fussent mentionnés dans le Rapport sans faire l'objet\r\nd'une disposition expresse, et cela parce que l'indication de deux cas\r\nparticuliers aurait pu faire croire que c'étaient les seuls dans\r\nlesquels la saisie se justifierait.\r\n\r\nTels sont les principes de droit international que la Conférence Navale\r\ns'est efforcée de reconnaître comme propres à régir pratiquement les\r\nrapports des peuples dans d'importantes matières pour lesquelles des\r\nrègles précises faisaient jusqu'à présent défaut. Elle a continué ainsi\r\nl'oeuvre de codification commencée par la Déclaration de Paris de 1856.\r\nElle a travaillé dans le même esprit que la Deuxième Conférence de la\r\nPaix et, profitant des travaux faits à La Haye, elle a pu résoudre un\r\ncertain nombre de problèmes que, faute de temps, cette Conférence avait\r\ndû laisser sans solution. Souhaitons que l'on puisse dire que ceux qui\r\nont élaboré la Déclaration de Londres de 1909 n'ont pas été trop\r\nindignes de leurs prédécesseurs de 1856 et de 1907.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISPOSITIONS FINALES.\r\n\r\nCes dispositions ont trait à diverses questions qui touchent à l'effet\r\nde la Déclaration, à sa ratification, à sa mise en vigueur, à sa\r\ndénonciation, à l'adhésion des Puissances non représentées.\r\n\r\nArticle 65.\r\n\r\n_Les dispositions de la présente Déclaration forment un ensemble\r\nindivisible._\r\n\r\nCet article est très important et conforme à ce qui avait été admis pour\r\nla Déclaration de Paris.\r\n\r\nLes règles contenues dans la présente Déclaration touchent à des points\r\ntrès importants et très différents. Elles n'ont pas toutes été acceptées\r\navec le même empressement par toutes les Délégations; des concessions\r\nont été faites sur un point en vue de concessions obtenues sur un autre.\r\nL'ensemble a été, tout balancé, reconnu satisfaisant. Une attente\r\nlégitime serait trompée, si une Puissance pouvait faire des réserves à\r\npropos d'une règle à laquelle une autre Puissance attache une importance\r\nparticulière.\r\n\r\nArticle 66.\r\n\r\n_Les Puissances Signataires s'engagent à s'assurer, dans le cas d'une\r\nguerre où les belligérants seraient tous parties à la présente\r\nDéclaration, l'observation réciproque des règles contenues dans cette\r\nDéclaration. Elles donneront, en conséquence, à leurs autorités et à\r\nleurs forces armées les instructions nécessaires et prendront les\r\nmesures qu'il conviendra pour en garantir l'application par leurs\r\ntribunaux, spécialement par leurs tribunaux de prises._\r\n\r\nD'après l'engagement qui résulte de cet article, la Déclaration\r\ns'applique dans les rapports entre les Puissances Signataires, quand les\r\nbelligérants sont également parties à la Déclaration.\r\n\r\nCe sera à chaque Puissance à prendre les mesures nécessaires pour\r\nassurer l'observation de la Déclaration. Ces mesures pourront varier\r\nsuivant les pays, exiger ou non l'intervention du pouvoir législatif.\r\nC'est une affaire d'ordre intérieur.\r\n\r\nIl faut remarquer que les Puissances neutres peuvent être aussi dans le\r\ncas de donner des instructions à leurs autorités, spécialement aux\r\ncommandants des convois, comme on l'a vu plus haut.\r\n\r\nArticle 67.\r\n\r\n_La présente Déclaration sera ratifiée aussitôt que possible._\r\n\r\n_Les ratifications seront déposées à Londres._\r\n\r\n_Le premier dépôt de ratifications sera constaté par un procès-verbal\r\nsigné par les Représentants des Puissances qui y prennent part, et par\r\nle Principal Secrétaire d'État de Sa Majesté Britannique au Département\r\ndes Affaires Étrangères._\r\n\r\n_Les dépôts ultérieurs de ratifications se feront au moyen d'une\r\nnotification écrite adressée au Gouvernement Britannique et accompagnée\r\nde l'instrument de ratification._\r\n\r\n_Copie certifiée conforme du procès-verbal relatif au premier dépôt de\r\nratifications, des notifications mentionnées à l'alinéa précédent, ainsi\r\nque des instruments de ratification qui les accompagnent, sera\r\nimmédiatement, par les soins du Gouvernement Britannique et par la voie\r\ndiplomatique, remise aux Puissances Signataires. Dans les cas visés par\r\nl'alinéa précédent, ledit Gouvernement leur fera connaître en même temps\r\nla date à laquelle il a reçu la notification._\r\n\r\nCette disposition toute de protocole n'a pas besoin d'explication. On a\r\nemprunté la formule admise à La Haye par la Deuxième Conférence de la\r\nPaix.\r\n\r\nArticle 68.\r\n\r\n_La présente Déclaration produira effet, pour les Puissances qui\r\nauront_ _participé au premier dépôt de ratifications, soixante jours\r\naprès la date du procès-verbal de ce dépôt et, pour les Puissances qui\r\nratifieront ultérieurement, soixante jours après que la notification de\r\nleur ratification aura été reçue par le Gouvernement Britannique._\r\n\r\nArticle 69.\r\n\r\n_S'il arrivait qu'une des Puissances Signataires voulût dénoncer la\r\nprésente Déclaration, elle ne pourra le faire que pour la fin d'une\r\npériode de douze ans commençant à courir soixante jours après le premier\r\ndépôt de ratifications et, ensuite, pour la fin de périodes successives\r\nde six ans, dont la première commencera à l'expiration de la période de\r\ndouze ans._\r\n\r\n_La dénonciation devra être, au moins un an à l'avance, notifiée par\r\nécrit au Gouvernement Britannique, qui en donnera connaissance à toutes\r\nles autres Puissances. Elle ne produira ses effets qu'à l'égard de la\r\nPuissance qui l'aura notifiée._\r\n\r\nIl résulte implicitement de l'article 69 que la Déclaration à une durée\r\nindéfinie. Les périodes après lesquelles la dénonciation peut se faire\r\nont été fixées par analogie de ce qui est admis dans la Convention pour\r\nl'établissement d'une Cour Internationale des prises.\r\n\r\nArticle 70.\r\n\r\n_Les Puissances représentées à la Conférence Navale de Londres,\r\nattachant un prix particulier à la reconnaissance générale des règles\r\nadoptées par elles, expriment l'espoir que les Puissances qui n'y\r\nétaient pas représentées adhéreront à la présente Déclaration. Elles\r\nprient le Gouvernement Britannique de vouloir bien les inviter à le\r\nfaire._\r\n\r\n_La Puissance qui désire adhérer notifie par écrit son intention au\r\nGouvernement Britannique en lui transmettant l'acte d'adhésion, qui sera\r\ndéposé dans les archives dudit Gouvernement._\r\n\r\n_Ce Gouvernement transmettra immédiatement à toutes les autres\r\nPuissances copie certifiée conforme de la notification, ainsi que de\r\nl'acte d'adhésion, en indiquant la date à laquelle il a reçu la\r\nnotification. L'adhésion produira effet soixante jours après cette\r\ndate._\r\n\r\n_La situation des Puissances adhérentes sera, en tout ce qui concerne\r\ncette Déclaration, assimilée à la situation des Puissances Signataires._\r\n\r\nLa Déclaration de Paris contenait déjà une invitation adressée aux\r\nPuissances non représentées, à l'effet d'adhérer à la Déclaration.\r\nL'invitation officielle, au lieu d'être faite individuellement par\r\nchacune des Puissances représentées à la Conférence, sera plus aisément\r\nfaite par la Grande-Bretagne agissant au nom de toutes.\r\n\r\nLes formes de l'adhésion sont très simples. L'assimilation des\r\nPuissances adhérentes aux Puissances Signataires entraîne naturellement\r\npour les premières l'observation de l'article 65; on ne peut adhérer à\r\nune partie de la Déclaration, mais seulement à l'ensemble.\r\n\r\nArticle 71.\r\n\r\n_La présente Déclaration, qui portera la date du 26 février 1909, pourra\r\nêtre signée à Londres, jusqu'au 30 juin 1909, par les Plénipotentiaires\r\ndes Puissances représentées à la Conférence Navale._\r\n\r\nComme à La Haye, on a tenu compte des convenances de certaines\r\nPuissances dont les Représentants peuvent ne pas être en situation de\r\nsigner dès à présent la Déclaration et qui cependant veulent être\r\nconsidérées comme des Puissances Signataires, non comme des Puissances\r\nadhérentes.\r\n\r\nIl va sans dire que les _Plénipotentiaires des Puissances_ dont il est\r\nparlé à l'article 71 ne sont pas nécessairement ceux qui avaient été\r\ndélégués comme tels à la Conférence Navale.\r\n\r\n_En foi de quoi, les Plénipotentiaires ont revêtu la présente\r\nDéclaration de leurs signatures et y ont apposé leurs cachets._\r\n\r\n_Fait à Londres, le vingt-six février mil neuf cent neuf, en un seul\r\nexemplaire, qui restera déposé dans les archives du Gouvernement\r\nBritannique et dont des copies, certifiées conformes, seront remises par\r\nla voie diplomatique aux Puissances représentées à la Conférence\r\nNavale._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX VIII\r\n\r\n      ADDITIONAL PROTOCOL TO THE CONVENTION CONCERNING THE\r\n      ESTABLISHMENT OF AN INTERNATIONAL PRIZE COURT\r\n      _Signed at the Hague, September 19, 1910_\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle premier.\r\n\r\nLes puissances signataires de la convention de La Haye du 18 octobre\r\n1907, relative à l'établissement d'une Cour Internationale des prises ou\r\ny adhérant, pour lesquelles des difficultés d'ordre constitutionnel\r\ns'opposent à l'acceptation, sous sa forme actuelle, de ladite\r\nconvention, ont la faculté de déclarer, dans l'acte de ratification ou\r\nd'adhésion, que, dans les affaires de prises rentrant dans la compétence\r\nde leurs tribunaux nationaux, le recours devant la Cour Internationale\r\ndes prises ne pourra être exercé contre elles que sous la forme d'une\r\naction en indemnité du préjudice causé par la capture.\r\n\r\nArticle 2.\r\n\r\nDans le cas de recours exercé devant la Cour Internationale des prises\r\nsous la forme d'une action en indemnité, l'article 8 de la convention\r\nest sans application; la Cour n'a pas à prononcer la validité ou la\r\nnullité de la capture, non plus qu'à infirmer ou confirmer la décision\r\ndes tribunaux nationaux.\r\n\r\nArticle 3.\r\n\r\nLes conditions auxquelles est subordonné par la convention l'exercice du\r\nrecours devant la Cour Internationale des prises sont applicables à\r\nl'exercice de l'action en indemnité.\r\n\r\nArticle 4.\r\n\r\nSous réserve des dispositions ci-après, les règles de procédure établies\r\npar la convention pour le recours devant la Cour Internationale des\r\nprises seront observées pour l'action en indemnité.\r\n\r\nArticle 5.\r\n\r\nPar dérogation à l'article 28, § 1, de la convention, l'instance en\r\nindemnité ne peut être introduite devant la Cour Internationale des\r\nprises qu'au moyen d'une déclaration écrite, adressée au Bureau\r\nInternational de la Cour permanente d'arbitrage.

Le Gouvernement du belligérant capteur, sans examiner si les\r\ndélais prescrits ont été observés, fait, dans les sept jours de la\r\nréception de la notification, transmettre au Bureau International le\r\ndossier de l'affaire en y joignant, le cas échéant, une copie certifiée\r\nconforme de la décision rendue par le tribunal national.\r\n\r\nArticle 7.\r\n\r\nPar dérogation à l'article 45, § 2, de la convention, la Cour, après le\r\nprononcé et la notification de son arrêt aux parties en cause, fait\r\nparvenir directement au Gouvernement du belligérant capteur le dossier\r\nde l'affaire qui lui a été soumise, en y joignant l'expédition des\r\ndiverses décisions intervenues ainsi que la copie des procès-verbaux de\r\nl'instruction.\r\n\r\nArticle 8.\r\n\r\nLe présent protocole additionnel sera considéré comme faisant partie\r\nintégrante de la convention et sera ratifié en même temps que celle-ci.\r\nSi la déclaration prévue à l'article 1 ci-dessus est faite dans l'acte\r\nde ratification, une copie certifiée conforme en sera insérée dans le\r\nprocès-verbal de dépôt des ratifications visé à l'article 52, § 3, de la\r\nconvention.\r\n\r\nArticle 9.\r\n\r\nL'adhésion à la convention est subordonnée à l'adhésion au présent\r\nprotocole additionnel.\r\n\r\nEn foi de quoi les Plénipotentiaires ont signé le présent protocole\r\nadditionnel.\r\n\r\nFait à La Haye le 19 septembre 1910, en un seul exemplaire qui sera\r\ndéposé dans les archives du Gouvernement des Pays-Bas et dont des\r\ncopies, certifiées conformes, seront remises, par la voie diplomatique,\r\naux Puissances désignées dans l'article 15 de la convention relative à\r\nl'établissement d'une Cour Internationale des prises du 18 octobre 1907\r\net dans son Annexe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX IX\r\n\r\n      FOREIGN ENLISTMENT ACT, 1870\r\n      33 & 34 VICT., CHAPTER 90\r\n      An Act to regulate the conduct of Her Majesty's Subjects\r\n      during the existence of hostilities between foreign states\r\n      with which Her Majesty is at peace.\r\n      [9 August 1870.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhereas it is expedient to make provision for the regulation of the\r\nconduct of Her Majesty's subjects during the existence of hostilities\r\nbetween foreign states with which Her Majesty is at peace:\r\n\r\nBe it enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the\r\nadvice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in\r\nthis present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Preliminary._\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Short Title of Act.]\r\n\r\n1.
