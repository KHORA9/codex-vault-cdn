No. 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A CHRISTMAS ROUND-ROBIN._\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nTHE MORNING BEFORE CHRISTMAS.\r\n\r\nWhen Malcolm Rutherford entered the library, on the morning of a certain\r\nday before Christmas, he was surprised to find his wife in tears. This\r\nwas all the more vexatious because he knew that she possessed everything\r\nto make a reasonable woman happy; but Mrs. Rutherford was not always a\r\nreasonable woman, being prone to causeless jealousy and impulsive to\r\nrashness. They lived about five miles from Winchester, Va., in which\r\ncity Rutherford had a fine legal practice.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter?\" he asked. \"Have any of our guests disappointed us?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" she replied, drying her eyes. \"They have all arrived and are in\r\ntheir rooms; and\"--here she assumed an air of mystery--\"in addition to\r\nthe house-party, I have invited a couple of strangers to dine with us\r\nto-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed! Isn't it just a little extraordinary to invite strangers?\" he\r\ninterrupted.\r\n\r\n\"Strangers they are to me, but not to you. The woman claimed to be a\r\nfriend of yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I have some friends whom you do not know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Miss Emily Tillinghurst, for example.\"\r\n\r\nRutherford started and turned red.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" continued his wife, in a tone of triumph, \"I think I have at last\r\ndetected you. The woman who called upon me this morning--she has but\r\njust gone--was a Mrs. Honey. She had a letter of introduction from Lydia\r\nWildfen; and what do you think her business was?\"\r\n\r\n\"How should I know?\"\r\n\r\n\"To solicit _our_ patronage for a school she is going to open in\r\nWinchester. She says that you can recommend her because you once\r\npersonally placed a young girl-pupil under her charge. Though dying of\r\nmortification at your having such a secret from me, I pretended to know\r\nall about it, and as your friend I asked her to dine with us to-day and\r\nto bring her husband.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good,\" was Rutherford's comment.\r\n\r\n\"It is _not_ very good; it is very bad. I demand an immediate\r\nexplanation of all the circumstances.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot give it,\" Rutherford replied, meditatively; \"not, at least,\r\nuntil after Christmas.\"\r\n\r\n\"A pretty Christmas I shall pass with these dreadful suspicions of you\r\ngnawing at my very heart. You must--you _shall_ explain it all to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I neither can nor will,\" said Rutherford, angrily; and he abruptly\r\nterminated the conversation by turning on his heel and leaving her to\r\nsuffer the tortures of what she believed to be well-founded jealousy.\r\n\r\nRutherford strode down the one street of the suburban village in such\r\nblind haste that he ran full tilt against old Mr. Robert Plowden, who\r\nwas taking a stroll, and who, with his young wife, was a guest of the\r\nRutherfords that Christmas.\r\n\r\n\"Dear me!\" he exclaimed, \"you almost knocked me over, Rutherford.\"\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me. I'm in an awful hurry to get to the telegraph office. It's\r\nfortunate I've met you here, as I've something to say to you which I\r\nwould sooner not say indoors.\"\r\n\r\n\"You surprise me,\" said Plowden, falling into step with Rutherford. \"Is\r\nit anything serious?\"\r\n\r\n\"Extremely.\"\r\n\r\n\"And concerns me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I will come to the point, so as not to keep you in suspense.\r\nAlthough so long settled in Virginia, you are an Englishman?\"\r\n\r\nPlowden nodded, and Rutherford continued: \"And although, before you\r\nmarried your present wife, always supposed to be a bachelor, in reality\r\nyou left a wife in England.\"\r\n\r\n\"Merciful heavens!\" exclaimed Plowden, half-falling against Rutherford\r\nin his surprise.\r\n\r\nHe was a physically weak old man. \"It is all true. I can explain\r\neverything satisfactorily, however. But how came you to know all this?\"\r\n\r\n\"I learned it from an elderly Englishwoman who came to my office\r\nyesterday. She called herself Maria Plowden--\"\r\n\r\nPlowden uttered a groan.\r\n\r\n\"I see you know the name.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" returned Plowden; \"it is that of my first wife, who died in\r\nEngland shortly after I came to this country.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure she died?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bless my soul! of course I'm sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you prove it?\" persisted the lawyer. \"How do you know that she is\r\ndead?\"\r\n\r\n\"I had a letter from a friend telling me so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you that letter?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know; I may have. But one doesn't keep letters for twenty\r\nyears. Why do you ask me all these questions?\"\r\n\r\nRutherford replied gravely: \"Because the elderly woman claimed to be\r\nyour wife, and desired to retain me as her counsel in the prosecution\r\nshe contemplated of her alleged husband, Robert Plowden, for bigamy.\"\r\n\r\n\"She's an impostor!\" cried Plowden.\r\n\r\n\"She says she has a bundle of letters which will establish her\r\nidentity,\" said Rutherford; \"and she was so anxious to begin her suit\r\nthat I could hardly persuade her that she would have to wait at least\r\nuntil after the holidays.\"\r\n\r\n\"My God!\" groaned Plowden, \"could there have been any mistake about her\r\ndeath?\"\r\n\r\n\"All things are possible, you know; your passing as a single man was\r\nhardly wise.\"\r\n\r\n\"That may be, Rutherford; but my married life had been so full of pain\r\nand shame that I wished with her death to bury all remembrance and\r\nreminder of it. When quite young I married for her beauty a girl greatly\r\nbeneath me in social station, and very ignorant. That I could have borne\r\nuncomplainingly, even after my infatuation was over, but her terrible\r\ntemper and, worse than all, her intemperate habits made my life a\r\nburden, and, divorce being then next to impossibility of attainment in\r\nEngland, I determined to leave her. In fact, I was obliged to do so. I\r\nplaced her in a private Home for Inebriates, and with my little Anna,\r\naged six, I came to this country. Shortly after my arrival here I was\r\ninformed of her death.\"\r\n\r\n\"By the proper authorities?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; for it seems she made her escape from the Home and died elsewhere.\r\nYou can understand that these sad facts made me disinclined to speak of\r\nmy married life; and as people seemed to take it for granted that I was\r\na bachelor--well, I simply did not contradict them.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what became of little Anna?\"\r\n\r\n\"She died on the vessel which brought us over,\" said Plowden with\r\nemotion. Quickly recovering himself, he inquired of Rutherford what he\r\nshould do in the matter.\r\n\r\nThe lawyer reflected a moment and then replied: \"I too am in trouble. It\r\nhas just occurred to me that you can help me, and in return I will do my\r\nbest to help you.\"\r\n\r\nPlowden assured him that he would do anything he could, and Rutherford\r\nproceeded to explain himself.\r\n\r\n\"I too have a secret,\" he said; \"not so bad a one as bigamy, thank\r\nHeaven! but bad enough.\"\r\n\r\nPlowden groaned, while the lawyer, with a surreptitious smile,\r\ncontinued: \"It concerns a young girl whom I placed at a boarding-school\r\nin New York years ago. Now, my wife--whose infernally jealous\r\ndisposition everybody knows--has been told of this by the very woman in\r\nwhose charge I put the girl. I saw her, though she did not see me, as\r\nshe came from my house half-an-hour ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"The girl?\"\r\n\r\n\"No: the schoolmistress.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is she?\"\r\n\r\n\"She was a Miss Archer--an old maid; a Winchester woman who lost all her\r\npeople and her money during the war. She then went to New York and\r\nopened a young ladies' school. Mrs. Wildfen was one of her pupils. She\r\nwas doing very well until she committed the folly of marrying her\r\nservant, a man named Honey, an extremely handsome but ignorant cockney,\r\nand young enough to be her son.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear me!\" ejaculated Plowden.\r\n\r\n\"This naturally caused a scandal. Her pupils were withdrawn in a body,\r\nand the school was closed for want of patronage. And now my wife tells\r\nme she has returned to open a school in Winchester. You will meet them\r\nat dinner to-day; my wife asked them.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's strange, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, a most unfortunate complication for me, their being where my wife\r\ncan--and she will--pump Mrs. Honey. It was to get the chance to do that,\r\nI fully believe, which made my wife invite them; hence the absolute need\r\nof my having some plausible story with which to satisfy Edna. You, by\r\nreason of your age and respectability, can better do this than anyone\r\nelse.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, 'pon my soul, Rutherford,\" expostulated Plowden, \"much as I would\r\nlike to serve you, I'm afraid I can't. What can I say to your wife?\"\r\n\r\n\"You can tell her that the girl was yours; that to hide her from your\r\nwife I secretly put her into the school, for you, under an assumed\r\nname.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what will my wife say--she who never suspected that I had a wife\r\nbefore her, much less a child?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it will be all right after Christmas. I can then square myself with\r\nmy wife, and you can make a clean breast of it to yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why don't _you_ make a clean breast of it at once? It happened before\r\nyour marriage, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, as for that, it would be all the same to Edna, if it had happened\r\nin a previous existence. But that isn't the question. It is a\r\nprofessional secret. I am under a pledge to an old client of mine for\r\nwhom I acted. He is now in Boston, and I'm going to telegraph him that\r\ndomestic peace demands my release from my pledge. So you see, Plowden,\r\nthat if you _can_ stave off my wife's suspicions until after Christmas,\r\nI will--\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"Stave off Mrs. Plowden Number One.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll do my best,\" groaned Plowden, \"though the Lord has not gifted me\r\nwith the art of deception.\"\r\n\r\n\"Inspiration will spring from necessity. Remember, it will bring us a\r\npeaceful Christmas and you--relief from Number One.\"\r\n\r\nTogether they entered the telegraph office, and Rutherford sent off his\r\nmessage to Boston.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nTHE AFTERNOON BEFORE CHRISTMAS.\r\n\r\nMiss Helen Fithian, a poor, elderly relative of Edna's, was spending the\r\nseason--much more than the holidays--with the Rutherfords. She and Edna\r\nwere sitting together in the library that afternoon, while the perturbed\r\nPlowden was learning his hard lesson of enforced duplicity. Mrs.\r\nRutherford was in no humor for conversation. Miss Fithian nestled into\r\nthe depths of a big arm-chair in a shadowy corner, clutched her lank red\r\nfingers over the tidy she was eternally crocheting and never finishing,\r\ndropped the eye-glasses from her bony nose into her lap, and went to\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\n\"Can I speak with you alone, Mrs. Rutherford?\" tremulously asked\r\nPlowden, stopping at the threshold.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, Mr. Plowden; come in,\" Edna replied, trying her best to\r\nspeak pleasantly. Plowden glanced at Miss Fithian. \"Oh, I am as good as\r\nalone,\" continued Edna, following his look. \"Helen is asleep; and even\r\nif she were awake, she could not hear you if you spoke in an undertone.\"\r\n\r\n\"True,\" assented Plowden. \"I forgot that she's as deaf as a post. Well,\r\nthe trouble is just this. Your husband has confided to me that a little\r\ndifference has arisen between you, owing to a slight misunderstanding--\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, indeed! 'A slight misunderstanding,' eh? Well?\" interpolated Mrs.\r\nRutherford, icily, but with fire in her eye.\r\n\r\nPlowden was very nervous, but he struggled on bravely: \"As I alone can\r\nset the matter right, he appealed to me to do so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! You think you can. I am curious to know how. I presume I shall\r\nunderstand as you go on.\"\r\n\r\nHe shuddered, but continued: \"In order that you may do so, I must reveal\r\nto you my secret--one that I have locked up for many years. When I came\r\nto this country, I left a wife in England.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed!\" exclaimed Edna, drawing away from him in surprise, and saying\r\nto herself, \"Ah! is he too a villain?\"\r\n\r\nInvoluntarily he raised his voice a little, to span the distance that\r\nnow separated them, and went on: \"Yes; but I had some excuse, I assure\r\nyou.\" He then related the story of his married life as he had told it to\r\nRutherford, carefully omitting, however, to mention the age of his\r\ndaughter.\r\n\r\nWhen he had finished, Edna remarked: \"Well, I _am_ surprised, Mr.\r\nPlowden. But still I do not see what all this has to do with me and my\r\nhusband.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am coming to that. You will see. Fearing that my wife might follow,\r\ntrace, and reclaim my daughter if she remained with me, I prevailed upon\r\nyour husband to place her in a boarding-school in New York, where she\r\nremained, under a false name, until, upon the death of her mother, I\r\nremoved her. Now, do you see?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do, I do!\" exclaimed Mrs. Rutherford, her clouded face clearing. \"How\r\nsimple it all is, in the light of this explanation! What a weight you\r\nhave lifted from my heart! I was looking forward to a wretched\r\nChristmas, but now I shall have such a happy one. How can I ever repay\r\nyou, Mr. Plowden, for your noble frankness?\"\r\n\r\n\"By keeping my secret, as your husband has done all these years.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will; I promise you that. Only, I do not see the necessity for\r\nsecrecy, since your trouble is over and done for, and you are happily\r\nmarried to another woman.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's just the reason, dear friend. You see, I allowed people to think\r\nI was a bachelor, if I did not actually tell them so. Gertrude became my\r\nwife under that belief.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why did you not tell her the truth before marriage?\"\r\n\r\n\"I tried to; but my dear, sweet, young Gertrude was so romantic that,\r\nwhile she could and did overlook the disparity in our ages, she never\r\nwould have done the fact that I had been married before and was a\r\nfather. It would have disenchanted her completely, and I should have\r\nlost her. So, you will keep my secret, my dear madam, will you not?\"\r\n\r\n\"That I will. Oh, how shall I ever forgive myself for wronging my own\r\ndear, innocent, faithful, self-sacrificing love by my cruel suspicions\r\nand hateful jealousy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Freely confess to him your fault.\"\r\n\r\n\"That I will. I will fly to him and ask his forgiveness.\"\r\n\r\nAnd \"fly\" she did, as literally as she could, but in the wrong\r\ndirection. As the last whisk of her skirts was heard in the direction of\r\nMr. Rutherford's study den, that wily gentleman emerged from a door on\r\nthe opposite side of the library.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" he demanded anxiously. \"Don't keep me on thorns. Have you made\r\nit all right with her?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have,\" replied Mr. Plowden.\r\n\r\n\"You don't mean to say she swallowed it all!\"\r\n\r\nPlowden nodded.\r\n\r\n\"And didn't even drop on the weak point in the story--that when I was\r\nsupposed to be placing in school your little girl, aged six years, I was\r\nnot much older myself?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\nThe two gentlemen exchanged a smile; then the elder, becoming serious,\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"But of course you will keep faith with me, Rutherford, and as soon as\r\nyou obtain your telegraphic release you will tell her the whole truth,\r\nwhatever that may be?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; but I can't get that, you know, until the day after Christmas. I\r\nhad to wire to my client's business address, so it was too late to\r\nconnect to-day. To-morrow is a holiday. It will be the day after before\r\nI can hear.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what about my affair?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is not so easily managed. Still, I have a suspicion that--but I'll\r\nsay nothing about that at present. The woman is very determined. I told\r\nher I could do nothing in the matter until after the holidays. She said\r\nshe didn't care 'three ha'pence for holidays,' and if I wouldn't take\r\nher case and push it, there were plenty of lawyers who would jump at the\r\nchance of prosecuting the rich Robert Plowden for bigamy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush! for heaven's sake!\" gasped Plowden, in a hoarse whisper, as, with\r\nan expression of terror in his countenance, he pointed at the old maid.\r\nRutherford also looked frightened as, wheeling round, he for the first\r\ntime descried her; but seeing who it was, and that she was asleep, he\r\nwas reassured, and replied indifferently:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it's all right--nobody but that mischief-making old cat who foists\r\nherself upon us six months out of every twelve. You gave me an awful\r\nscare. But she's as deaf as an adder when awake, and can't hear thunder\r\nwhen asleep. Come, let's go to the billiard-room and have a game. I feel\r\nlike a new man, now that I've got a respite from this business until\r\nafter Christmas.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I can't forget that it's only a respite, and my anxiety will\r\nspoil Christmas for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so will mine, I suppose, but we must not show it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, what a pair of reprobates we are!\" groaned Plowden, as his host led\r\nhim away to the billiard-room, which, as is frequently seen in the\r\nSouth, was a detached structure, at a little distance from the main\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the front door closed behind the gentlemen than Miss\r\nFithian sprang up. Pallid and quivering with wrath, she muttered half\r\naudibly:\r\n\r\n\"So I'm 'a mischief-making old cat,' am I? and I 'foist myself on' you,\r\nyou villain! do I? and I'm 'deaf as a post and an adder,' am I? Well,\r\nI'm not so deaf but what I heard the whole of your vile plot to conceal\r\nyour crimes; and if I am deaf--you hypocrites! you conspirators! you\r\nbigamists!--you shall find that I'm not dumb!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS EVE.\r\n\r\nNot until she was dressing for dinner did Edna Rutherford find herself\r\nalone with her husband. Then, between sobs and buttoning her shoes,\r\nbroken sentences and doing up her hair, she, metaphorically speaking,\r\nsmote her breast and cried, \"_Mea culpa! mea culpa!_ I have sinned\r\nagainst thee! Forgive me!\"\r\n\r\nRutherford was not only a shrewd lawyer, but a natural diplomat; and\r\nfinding himself master of the situation, he took advantage of it to\r\nexact a promise--which she passionately and penitently gave--that she\r\nwould \"never again suspect him; no, not even on the evidence of her own\r\neyes and ears.\" This signal victory and the extreme comprehensiveness of\r\nthe articles of capitulation thus agreed upon enabled Mr. Rutherford to\r\nmeet Mr. and Mrs. Honey with that calm, clear conscience which finds its\r\nstrength in the certainty of the impossibility of detection. He greeted\r\nthem with the unruffled mien and courteous ease of the polished\r\ngentleman--a manner that fairly overwhelmed the ex-man-servant, and made\r\nhim feel that to possess it he would willingly have bartered his remote\r\nfuture to the arch-fiend. None but Honey himself knew how unhappy he was\r\nmade by his dress-suit, which seemed to persistently inspire him with\r\nthe idea that he was still a waiter; or how wretched he was in the\r\nconstant fear that he would be betrayed by that inspiration into the\r\ndoing of something for which Mrs. Honey would pounce upon him. In vain\r\nhe had implored his inexorable partner to be allowed to stay at home,\r\nimpressing those considerations upon her with all the eloquence of which\r\nhe was possessed; and indeed she saw for herself that he could not\r\nrefrain, when he wore his dress-coat, from laying his handkerchief over\r\nhis left arm like a waiter's napkin. Mrs. Honey replied, however, that\r\nhe _must_ meet people on a footing of equality or he would never learn\r\nhow to conduct himself properly in society; an argument which finally\r\ninduced him to accompany her, shamefacedly.\r\n\r\nOnly the persons already mentioned in this narration sat down that\r\nafternoon to what was destined to be a fateful Christmas Eve dinner.\r\nSmiling faces masked anxious hearts, all round the board. The Wildfens\r\nhad had a more than usually spirited battle of words just before coming\r\ndown from their room. Mr. Honey endured the misery of constant effort\r\nfor the maintenance of a correct deportment, to insure which his wife\r\nseemed to fix her gray eyes steadily upon him with a stony glare, while\r\nshe held an iron-shod heel ever ready to crunch his corns as a silent\r\nmonition. Edna was still afraid that her husband had not really forgiven\r\nher in his heart; and Rutherford's mind was far from easy. Plowden felt\r\nthat he might just as well be a murderer as a mere bigamist, so\r\nconscience-stricken and care-ridden was he. Miss Fithian, osseous, grim,\r\nand scowling, looked like \"the skeleton at the feast,\" and felt like\r\n\"the dread Avenger.\" The only undisturbed soul present was that of\r\npretty, gentle Mrs. Plowden.\r\n\r\nWalnuts and wine were reached at last. Then Mrs. Wildfen remembered how\r\nfond Mrs. Honey used to be of making speeches, wherever she might air\r\nher oratorical gifts, and in an unlucky moment called upon her to make a\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\nMrs. Honey was in the act of rising to respond, when Miss Fithian,\r\nrudely pushing her down upon her chair, took precedence and demanded of\r\nMrs. Wildfen:\r\n\r\n\"You want a speech, do you? I'll make you one that will make certain\r\npersons here tremble.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt about that. Two of them--the conspirators--were\r\ntrembling already. They felt instinctively that the hour of trouble for\r\nthem had arrived.\r\n\r\n\"Cousin Edna,\" continued the spinster, \"I regret the pain I feel it my\r\nduty to inflict upon you, but that false husband of yours has again\r\ndeceived you.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Rutherford sprang to her feet, instantly armed _cap-à-pie_ with her\r\nnever-failing jealousy: \"What do you mean?\" she gasped.\r\n\r\n\"Silence!\" cried Rutherford in a commanding tone to Miss Fithian.\r\n\r\nPlowden, who had been struggling with a sudden faintness, suddenly\r\nsuccumbed to it and fell against his wife, who cried out in alarm, \"Rob!\r\nRob! what's the matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will _not_ silence, sir,\" retorted the old maid, \"for I consider it\r\nmy duty to publicly expose and denounce you--'deaf as a post' though I\r\nmay be\" (here Plowden gave such an agonized groan that his wife forcibly\r\npoured a glass of wine down his throat, choking but reviving him), \"and\r\n'deaf as an adder,' Mr. Rutherford, I overheard you confess the foul\r\nplot you and that monster had concocted to deceive my poor cousin, your\r\nlong-suffering, unsuspecting wife. Oh! I'm not afraid of you,\" she\r\ncried, as Rutherford arose with a dangerous look in his eyes. \"The girl\r\nyou placed at school was the creature of your villainy, and not\r\nPlowden's daughter.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" cried Mrs. Rutherford, as Mrs. Plowden at the same moment\r\nexclaimed: \"His daughter! Of course not. He never had a daughter. Had\r\nyou, ducky?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ducky\" was unable to quack a negative, or even to respond when Mr.\r\nRutherford in a stentorian voice called: \"Give this woman the lie,\r\nPlowden.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what if he should,\" retorted Miss Fithian; \"who would believe the\r\nword of a bigamist?\"\r\n\r\n\"A bigamist!\" cried a chorus of voices.\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean that my husband is a bigamist?\" demanded Mrs. Plowden,\r\njumping to her feet, her eyes flashing.\r\n\r\n\"I do mean it. Ask him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Deny it, Rob, love! Mr. Plowden! Deny it, darling,\" urged Gertrude,\r\nseizing his collar and giving him a shake.\r\n\r\nThe movement disturbed the doubtful balance of his limp form; he slid\r\nfrom his chair and disappeared under the table, almost unconscious.\r\nSurprise at his sudden vanishing-act so startled everybody that a\r\nmomentary silence ensued, in which sounded sharply the ringing of the\r\nfront-door bell. Honey instinctively jumped up to answer the summons,\r\nbut was promptly recalled by his quick-witted wife to a proper\r\nrealization of his altered social condition. That poised heel came down\r\nwith such vigor on his toes that he howled with pain.\r\n\r\n\"Do that 'ere just once more,\" he yelled, savagely, \"han' I'll cut loose\r\nfrom you for good.\"\r\n\r\n\"You never can hear a bell ring but you want to run and answer it,\" she\r\nretorted, in an undertone.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture, Sam, the old darkey factotum, shambled in with a card,\r\nfor which Honey, in his pain and confusion, unthinkingly stretched out\r\nhis hand. Sam gave it to him and left the room.\r\n\r\n\"Who is it? Who is it?\" demanded several voices.\r\n\r\n\"Read it out, Mr. Honey,\" called Mrs. Wildfen.\r\n\r\n\"I cawn't, ma'am; hit's writin', an' I cawn't read writin'.\"\r\n\r\n\"William!\" cried Mrs. Honey, in an awful voice, snatching the card from\r\nhim and again bringing down that merciless heel upon his already aching\r\ntoes. Honey sprang to his feet with a cry of anger and pain,\r\nhalf-threatening and half-whining--the vocal outcome of his divided\r\nemotions--proclaiming:\r\n\r\n\"That settles it. I told you I would if you did it wunst more. 'Arriet,\r\nI said I would, and I will. I'm a-goin', for wunst and hallways.\"\r\n\r\nAs he dashed out of the room, with a ludicrous limp, there was a general\r\ncry of \"Come back, Honey! come back!\" But Mrs. Honey arose and, though\r\nvery pale, said with much dignity:\r\n\r\n\"Oblige me, ladies and gentlemen, by letting him go. I deserve this\r\npublic desertion for my folly in marrying my inferior. The name on the\r\ncard is '_Mrs. Plowden_.'\"\r\n\r\nA blood-curdling groan nearly froze the blood in the veins of the\r\nguests. It came from under the table, whence, simultaneously with it,\r\nemerged Plowden, to whom terror lent instant animation and activity.\r\n\r\n\"My wife!\" he breathed, huskily.\r\n\r\n\"Your wife!\" exclaimed Gertrude. \"Then it is true! You are a bigamist!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes! No! She's dead! Save me from her!\" he cried incoherently, rushing\r\nto the French window overlooking the lawn and throwing it open. \"You\r\nwill forgive me, Gertrude,\" he declaimed, with his foot upon the\r\nwindow-sill, \"when the black waters are surging over my head. Farewell!\r\nFarewell forever!\" And leaping out into the darkness, he was gone.\r\n\r\n\"Stop him! stop him, someone!\" pleaded Gertrude. \"He will drown\r\nhimself!\"\r\n\r\n\"He can't,\" sneered Miss Fithian; \"the fish-pond is frozen over.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would advise you, sir,\" now remarked Mrs. Rutherford to her husband,\r\nin a voice of suppressed passion, \"to follow your fellow-criminal.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will, madam,\" he retorted, in a like tone of restrained fury; \"and\r\nsince you actually presume to order me from my own house, I go--never to\r\nreturn.\" As he spoke, he too passed out through the window.\r\n\r\nA momentary awe seemed to oppress those remaining at the table. The\r\nsilence was soon broken, however, by Wildfen saying to his wife:\r\n\r\n\"A pretty row you've made all around, haven't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I!\" exclaimed Lydia, in amazement.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you.\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, by giving Mrs. Honey a letter of introduction to Mrs.\r\nRutherford--as you confessed to me you did.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure I didn't mean any harm by it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You did,\" persisted the quarrelsome Wildfen. \"You're always making\r\nmischief and pretending you don't mean to.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are. And I want to tell you, once for all, that I'm tired of your\r\neternally contradicting me. Do it once more, just once, and I'll follow\r\nthe other gentlemen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who cares if you do?\"\r\n\r\n\"You do.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! already! Now I _am_ off;\" and he sprang up and started for the\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye, and good riddance,\" Lydia called out, as his form vanished in\r\nthe darkness without, and the window closed behind him with a slam; then\r\nsank back in her chair, laughing hysterically. This roused Mrs.\r\nRutherford from the semi-stupor into which she had sunk.\r\n\r\n\"Laugh,\" she said bitterly, rousing herself; \"laugh while my heart is\r\nbreaking. No, do not speak. I want no sympathy, no pity. I know his\r\nperfidy now, and shall know how to act.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why! what's happened to Mrs. Plowden?\" exclaimed Lydia.\r\n\r\n\"She has been in a faint since her villain escaped,\" replied Miss\r\nFithian, who was supporting the unconscious form, \"and I've been trying\r\nto revive her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Open the window,\" suggested Edna.\r\n\r\n\"No, don't,\" cried the contradictory Lydia. \"If you do, I'll catch my\r\ndeath of cold.\"\r\n\r\n\"She's coming to,\" said Mrs. Honey. \"Oh, here's the punch coming in.\r\nGive her a drink of that and she will be all right.\"\r\n\r\nSam, who brought in the steaming punch-bowl and placed it upon the\r\ntable, stared about him in amazement, unable to comprehend the\r\nmysterious disappearance of all the gentlemen. He knew that Mr. Honey\r\nhad gone out by the front door, but, the window being closed, the idea\r\nof the others having made their exit by that way did not occur to him.\r\n\r\n\"Where's the woman who brought that card, Sam?\" spoke up Miss Fithian.\r\n\"Ask her in. She will bear evidence to the truth of my charge.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, miss,\" replied Sam, \"dat a' woman acted de mos' curusest you ebber\r\nsee. She done come to de do' an' stan' dah, till she see dat a' Mistah\r\nHoney come a-shootin' out de dinin'-room do' an' fro' de front do' like\r\nhe done gone mad. She scrunch herself clus agin de wall fo' to let him\r\npahs, an' he go by like de bird an' nebber see her. Den she scoot out\r\nan' scuttle off, like de debble he after her, in jes' de udder way what\r\nhe didn't took.\"\r\n\r\n\"Strange!\" commented Mrs. Wildfen, and looked disappointed when no\r\nfamiliar voice responded, \"No, it isn't.\" The silence and the empty\r\nchair beside her quickly reminded her that her contradictor was\r\ngone--perhaps forever.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS.\r\n\r\nWhen Rutherford, in a white heat of wrath, rushed from the house, he\r\nfound Plowden in the garden, jumping from one foot to the other with an\r\nagility surprising in a man of his age, and vigorously slapping his\r\nsides with his arms, as if embracing an invisible friend.\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing?\" asked the lawyer.\r\n\r\n\"Trying to keep myself warm. Why do you follow me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I was ordered to--\"\r\n\r\n\"It is useless; leave me to my fate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hello! Who's that?\" exclaimed Rutherford, as he caught the sound of a\r\nman's running. \"Hello!\"\r\n\r\n\"'Ullo, yourself,\" came back in the unmistakable English accent of\r\nHoney, who quickly came up, panting.\r\n\r\n\"It's Bow-Bells,\" said Rutherford. \"Why are you running so?\"\r\n\r\n\"To keep warm. I've run hup an' down the road, hand I cawn't see no\r\nsigns of hany hinn or public.\"\r\n\r\n\"No; there is none near. But come with me. I am still your host, and I\r\nthink I can make you at least measurably comfortable for the night in\r\nthe billiard-house.\"\r\n\r\nAs they eagerly started to follow Rutherford, glad of any shelter, a\r\nvoice was heard behind them hallooing, \"Hi, there!\" and brought them to\r\na halt.\r\n\r\n\"Ha! ha!\" laughed Rutherford, \"if it isn't Wildfen! There has evidently\r\nbeen a general mutiny among the women.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where are you all going?\" asked Wildfen, joining them. \"Take me along,\r\nwherever it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come on quickly, then,\" replied Rutherford, leading the way, like the\r\ncaptain of a small skirmishing party, to the billiard-house.\r\n\r\nIt seemed by the flickering light of a match rather a bare, desolate,\r\ncheerless sort of place, but they were all too glad to find shelter, to\r\nmake any complaints. \"And now,\" he continued, having lighted a lamp,\r\n\"make yourselves as comfortable as you can, while I find Sam and get\r\nsome things to render our plight a little more endurable.\"\r\n\r\n\"If he could slip our overcoats out of the hall and bring them here,\"\r\nsuggested Plowden.\r\n\r\n\"Of course he can. Don't be uneasy; you'll be all right in a few\r\nminutes.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, we won't,\" muttered Wildfen, querulously, in an undertone.\r\n\r\n\"Of course; we shall be quite jolly, you know,\" spoke up Honey\r\ncheerfully, in reply to Rutherford's encouraging words.\r\n\r\nPlowden said nothing. His soul was precipitated into a depth of gloom,\r\nwhere its only company was a vaguely-formed but terrible demon labelled\r\n\"Bigamy.\" It was that presence, even more than the weather, which made\r\nhim shiver.\r\n\r\nRutherford was gone but a short time, and when he returned was\r\naccompanied by Sam, who bore a load of overcoats and a bottle of some\r\namber fluid that seemed to bestow warmth and animation. The faithful old\r\nservant proved himself an able skirmisher. Snatching a pillow from one\r\nroom and a blanket from another, making prey of a quilt here and a\r\ncomforter there, he succeeded eventually in getting from the\r\nguest-chambers a fair supply of bedding, which he transferred to the\r\nbilliard-house. He also got in an ample pile of wood, with which Honey\r\nskilfully made a rousing fire on the broad, open hearth. Honey, too,\r\nutilized the bedding as it was brought in, making as comfortable couches\r\nas possible under the circumstances, on a sofa and three chairs for\r\nPlowden and Wildfen, and upon the floor for himself. Rutherford dragged\r\nfrom a closet an old hammock that he sometimes used to take a summer\r\nafternoon nap in, and said he would sleep in that, with a blanket around\r\nhim. Honey found another lamp and lighted it. What with the cheery glow\r\nof the dancing firelight, the bright lamps, and the colors of the\r\nbedding distributed about, the erstwhile dismal room began to seem\r\nrather pleasant, and in great measure the happy transformation was due\r\nto Honey's readiness and ability in doing things which belonged to his\r\nproper sphere of effort.\r\n\r\n\"Are we going to bed?\" asked Plowden, sadly.\r\n\r\n\"I should say not,\" ejaculated Wildfen. \"Why, it isn't more than eight\r\no'clock.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am in no humor for sleep to-night,\" said Rutherford, moodily.\r\n\r\n\"I'm hagreeable for hanythink,\" remarked Honey, amiably.\r\n\r\n\"What do you say to a quiet game of 'draw'?\" suggested Wildfen.\r\n\r\nThe idea suited Rutherford; Honey knew a little about the game and liked\r\nit; and Plowden, though he had some doubt about his ability to play it,\r\nupon learning that it was not in the least like whist said he would try.\r\nSo Sam, when he came in with another load of fire-wood, was despatched\r\nto capture a pack of cards from his master's room and a box of gun-wads\r\nfrom the closet where Rutherford's sporting paraphernalia were kept.\r\n\r\nThe game was not a lively one, and a gloomy despondency seemed to spread\r\nits shadow over the table.\r\n\r\n\"This is very far, my friends,\" remarked Rutherford, \"from the pleasant\r\nevening I hoped to give you.\"\r\n\r\n\"No matter,\" sighed Plowden, resignedly; \"even this is better than being\r\nhanged for bigamy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, pshaw, man! that is not a hanging offence. And you're not even\r\nconvicted yet. Don't give way so. You'll come out all right.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I suppose we all will--if we don't starve meanwhile,\" grumbled\r\nWildfen.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no fear of that,\" laughed Rutherford. \"Sam will see to it that we\r\nat least sit at the second table.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what I've been used to,\" remarked Honey, unthinkingly; and then,\r\nrecalling himself, seemed to listen for a sharp voice saying in reproof,\r\n\"William!\" After a moment he went on confusedly, \"Well, gents. I don't\r\npretend I'm equal to my position among you. Hit was 'er has dragged me\r\nhinto hit; I didn't want ter come. But that's hall hover an' done for.\r\nShe's a good woman, honly I cawn't stand 'er hallways ha-naggink hat me\r\nhafore folks, hand ha pickink me hup habout my haitches. Why, hafore she\r\nmarried me, hif I'd ha' dropped ha bushel hof 'em she wouldn't ha' said\r\nnothink. Marriage, gents, 'as been a werry big disappintment to yours\r\ntrewly.\"\r\n\r\n\"My wife,\" said Wildfen, sullenly, \"is the spirit of contradiction\r\npersonified.\"\r\n\r\n\"And mine of jealousy,\" added Rutherford.\r\n\r\n\"And mine of all that's angelic,\" moaned Plowden; \"therefore I must be\r\ntorn from her by the rude clutches of the law. Did you observe how\r\nsweetly she bore the horrible revelation? She looked like a drooping\r\nlily, didn't she, Wildfen?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered that embodied negative; \"you did the drooping-lily part\r\nof the play yourself. But are we going to stay here all Christmas, while\r\nthey are having a good time by themselves?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid so, unless we sneak back, humbly beg pardon, and persuade\r\nthem to take pity on us,\" replied Rutherford.\r\n\r\n\"Never!\" exclaimed the others as one man, except Plowden, who said that\r\nhe was tired and would lie down, though he did not suppose he could\r\nsleep. So he dropped out of the game and stretched himself on the sofa,\r\nwhere Honey neatly tucked him up. The others played on until gray dawn.\r\n\r\nA little after midnight, Rutherford, having chanced to glance at his\r\nwatch, grimly wished his companions:\r\n\r\n\"Merry Christmas, gentlemen.\"\r\n\r\n\"It isn't,\" snarled Wildfen.\r\n\r\nPlowden uttered a groan, so long and deep that the others laughed; and\r\nafter that laugh they seemed to brighten up a little.\r\n\r\nThe sound of crunching footsteps in the new-fallen snow was heard\r\noutside a little after eight o'clock, and Honey, looking out of the\r\nwindow, exclaimed joyously:\r\n\r\n\"'Ere's Sam, with a basket han a coffee-pot!\"\r\n\r\nRutherford apologized for the poor fare, but the coffee was excellent,\r\nthe bread and cold meat were appetizing, and Honey, who was the Mark\r\nTapley of the occasion, voiced the general sentiment when, having aided\r\nSam in spreading the viands on a billiard-table, he said: \"Cold wit les\r\nis werry heatable when you're 'ungry. Ah!\" he added, reflectively, \"me\r\nan' mother 'as hoften been werry 'ard pushed to get has good has this\r\n'ere.\"\r\n\r\n\"You haven't got a mother, have you?\" asked Wildfen. He couldn't quite\r\ncontradict the affirmation of a maternal entity, but came near it, in\r\nhis tone at least.\r\n\r\n\"Yessir, I 'ave. That's one reason I married habove me--for to get ha\r\ncomfortable 'ome for mother. My wife said Hi might bring 'er from\r\nHengland, an' we've brought 'er 'ere to Winchester, to keep 'ouse for\r\nus, while me and 'Arriet keeps school.\"\r\n\r\nTo cover the general smile at this remark, Rutherford asked Sam how the\r\nladies were getting on.\r\n\r\n\"Dunno how dey is dis mawnin', mars'r.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did Mrs. 'Oney stay?\" inquired her husband.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sah. I heard missus say her husband done leave her dah; she got\r\nstay dah till he done come back an' git her.\"\r\n\r\n\"And my Gertrude,\" asked Mr. Plowden, anxiously, \"how was she enjoying\r\nherself?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dey wa'n't nobody 'joyin' desselves, so fur as I seed, sah. Dey was\r\na-doin' a powah of talkin'. I hyah missus say, sarcastic-like, it were\r\nde 'mizziblest merry Christmas' she ebber see; an' de udders groan like\r\nde elders does in a 'sperience meetin' when dey means 'Yes, Lawd.'\"\r\n\r\nSam's understanding of the prevailing sentiment among the ladies was\r\nquite correct. When each of them sought her solitary bed, that night\r\nbefore Christmas, it was with an aching heart that it should be so\r\ndesolate and dreary. In the morning they dolefully wished each other \"A\r\nMerry Christmas!\" and, after a late and melancholy breakfast, sat in\r\nconclave in the library, to discuss the situation.\r\n\r\n\"Where they all can have gone to, puzzles me,\" observed Mrs. Rutherford.\r\n\"There is not a house this side of Winchester where they could get\r\naccommodation for the night.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was bitter cold last night,\" sighed Mrs. Wildfen; \"and poor Steve is\r\nsuch a shivery fellow anyway, he would have frozen if he had tried to\r\nwalk to town.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps they're all frozen,\" suggested Miss Fithian, with an air of\r\nhopelessness.\r\n\r\n\"If they are,\" said Mrs. Rutherford, sternly, \"you, Helen, will have\r\nfour murders on your soul.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see why you couldn't have kept quiet, at least till after\r\nChristmas. It wasn't any of your business anyway,\" remarked Mrs.\r\nWildfen, aggressively, to the old maid.\r\n\r\n\"Umph!\" sniffed Miss Fithian. \"It's safest not to rub cats the wrong\r\nway\"--which ambiguous expression her hearers vaguely construed as having\r\nmerely a general application, they not knowing its personal\r\nsignificance.\r\n\r\n\"Well, it has just completely spoiled our Christmas,\" sighed Plowden's\r\nyoung wife.\r\n\r\n\"And theirs too--if there's any comfort in that,\" added Mrs. Honey. \"I\r\nnever knew my angel boy to show so much spirit before. His favorite corn\r\nmust have been very bad.\"\r\n\r\nNo one inquired the relation between his spirit and his corns.\r\n\r\n\"Have any of you decided upon a course of action?\" inquired the hostess.\r\n\"You don't seem to, since you say nothing. Well, I have, then. As soon\r\nas the law courts open after Christmas, I shall apply for a divorce from\r\nMr. Rutherford.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see upon what ground,\" observed Mrs. Honey, who was not only\r\nthe oldest but the most practically informed woman present.\r\n\r\n\"He has deceived me.\"\r\n\r\n\"His putting a young girl in my charge proves nothing; not even that. It\r\nseems to me that there is a game of cross-purposes here--something\r\nunderneath all this that we do not understand, and that only the\r\ninterested parties can explain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Explain in their own way,\" retorted Mrs. Rutherford.\r\n\r\n\"Ladies,\" said the amiable Mrs. Plowden, \"what has occurred is very\r\nunpleasant, but for all of you is only a little disagreement that\r\nreally--as Mrs. Honey says--may be capable of explanation and eventual\r\nreconciliation with your husbands. But what is my position? I am the\r\nonly one who has been terribly deceived, beyond the possibility of a\r\ndoubt, and the consequences of that deceit are irreparable. If Mr.\r\nPlowden left a legitimate wife in England, then what is my position?\r\nWhat am I?\"\r\n\r\n\"The divorce court,\" said Mrs. Rutherford, \"is as open to you as to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I don't want a divorce from my Robert,\" sobbed the \"willowy\" and\r\nnow weeping Gertrude.\r\n\r\n\"And you don't need any if he has really been guilty of bigamy,\" added\r\nthe practical Mrs. Honey.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'm sure he did not intend to deceive me. He must have married me\r\nby mistake.\"\r\n\r\n\"Married by mistake! That's a new way of marrying. Ha, ha!\" laughed Miss\r\nFithian, scornfully.\r\n\r\n\"I am willing,\" continued Mrs. Plowden, unheeding the old maid's\r\ntaunting laugh, \"to wait for his explanation before condemning him, if\r\nhe would only come back and make it; but I fear he may never do so. Even\r\nnow I tremble to think that he may be behind prison bars.\"\r\n\r\n\"If so,\" replied Mrs. Wildfen, \"he at least is well fed and warm, no\r\ndoubt, while my poor Steve is wandering over the frozen roads, in the\r\nsnow, houseless, hungry--and on Christmas, of all days in the year.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a wretched quarrel, when there should be 'peace on earth,\r\ngood-will to men'!\" commented Mrs. Honey. \"I could find it in my heart\r\nto forgive William, if only for the sake of the season.\"\r\n\r\nNone of the ladies felt \"up\" to going to church, so they passed the\r\ntime, until luncheon was served, speculating upon what had become of the\r\ngentlemen, and how they were faring. When they returned to the library,\r\nand were talking there, the Indian-like ear of Mrs. Rutherford caught\r\nunwonted sounds in the dining-room, and she quickly glided into the\r\nhall-way to learn the cause of the violent clattering of dishes,\r\nscuffling of feet, and masculine coughing she heard. Darting into the\r\ndining-room, she surprised Sam (was the artful Sam surprised?) in the\r\nact of clearing the remains of the luncheon from the table and packing\r\nthem into a large market-basket.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Sam!\" she demanded, \"what does this mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fo' de Lawd, missus, I dassent tell,\" he replied, affecting great\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\n\"You must. I insist upon it. Where are you going with that basket of\r\nfood?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, missus, ef I must 'fess, I 'fess. I gwine take it to mars'r. I'se\r\non'y a pore ole nigger, but I can't let de gemmen starve, specially\r\nyoung mars'r.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is he?\"\r\n\r\n\"In de billiard-house, missus. All de gemmen dah. Dey's mose starbe',\r\nmose froze; don't hab nuffin but cole stuff dis mawnin. Mars'r look\r\nmighty sick, an' I reck'n dat ole man, Mars'r Plowden, he mose done\r\ngone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sam,\" said Mrs. Rutherford, with her usual impulsiveness, \"after you\r\nhave taken that basket to them, come back to me. In the meantime, I will\r\nconsult with my friends as to what steps to take. But say nothing to the\r\ngentlemen about this until I bid you.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, missus,\" replied Sam, shuffling off with his load, and wearing a\r\nknowing smile on his honest black face. While the husbands were\r\ndiscussing the viands he carried to them, their wives were discussing\r\nthe new situation of affairs.\r\n\r\n\"Ladies,\" said Mrs. Rutherford, after informing them of the whereabouts\r\nof their spouses, \"you are all at liberty to invite your husbands back\r\nhere to dinner; whether you do so or not is for each of you to decide\r\nfor herself. As for me, Mr. Rutherford said he would never return, and I\r\nam not going to ask him to.\"\r\n\r\n\"We all, in the heat of passion, say things,\" replied Mrs. Honey, \"which\r\nat the time we think we mean, but for which we are afterwards sorry. Did\r\nnot William say he left me forever?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered Mrs. Wildfen, \"he said 'wunst an' hallways.'\"\r\n\r\n\"That's unkind of you, Lydia,\" remarked the gentle Gertrude. \"What does\r\nit matter whether a man spells his heart with an 'h' or an 'a,' so long\r\nas it is in the right place?--as I am sure Mr. Honey's is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, my dear,\" responded Mrs. Honey, with moistening eyes. \"Your\r\ngood husband can never have committed the crime imputed to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor mine either, I suppose you think?\" queried Mrs. Rutherford; to\r\nwhich the schoolmistress replied that that certainly was what she did\r\nthink.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" sneered Miss Fithian; \"you're all in the melting mood. You'll\r\nget down on your knees and beg 'em to come back and trample on you.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Honey smiled as she remarked: \"They must, by this time, be too\r\nfamished to trample much. I know that must be my husband's condition.\r\nWith his enormous appetite I think he must be now about starved into\r\nsubmission, if not penitence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Remember, it is Christmas, and we should forgive and forget,\" said Mrs.\r\nPlowden. \"Suppose we unite in an invitation to them to come to dinner\r\nto-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" eagerly responded Mrs. Honey, \"and send it by Sam, with a flag\r\nof truce.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and put in that we will undertake to keep the peace during\r\ndinner,\" added Mrs. Plowden.\r\n\r\n\"Say rather,\" suggested Mrs. Rutherford, \"that we will preserve an armed\r\nneutrality.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, that's too warlike,\" protested Mrs. Honey; \"I will draw up a\r\npacific invitation, and we will all sign it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't,\" promptly objected Mrs. Wildfen. \"At least, I won't put my\r\nname first. That would look as if I had flung down my arms and\r\nsurrendered unconditionally.\"\r\n\r\n\"What then _shall_ we do to preserve our dignity and get them back?\"\r\npiteously asked Mrs. Plowden. \"Rob and I had no quarrel, and I want\r\nhim--bigamist or no bigamist.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Plowden! I am shocked! and will no longer remain under the same\r\nroof with you!\" exclaimed Miss Fithian. \"Edna, I am going to order Jim\r\nto hitch up the sleigh and drive me to the depot. I shall go to cousin\r\nMelinda's.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Rutherford made a feeble show of urging her to remain until after\r\ndinner, but she replied: \"No, no; I will not sit at table with your\r\nhypocrite and that woman's bigamist.\"\r\n\r\nSaid Mrs. Rutherford coldly, \"Then I fear that we will have to be\r\ndeprived of the pleasure of your society.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as order was again restored, after Miss Fithian's unregretted\r\ndeparture, Mrs. Honey took up the interrupted theme. \"Suppose, then,\"\r\nshe said, thoughtfully, \"as no one seems willing to sign first, that we\r\ndraw up a 'round-robin' which we can all sign, without either seeming to\r\nlead.\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't,\" again objected Mrs. Wildfen--\"not until I know what a\r\n'round-robin' is.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a paper to which signatures are affixed in a surrounding circle,\r\nso that the precedence of all is equal.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'll sign that!\" \"So will I!\" \"And I!\" responded the other wives.\r\n\r\nThis then was the form in which Mrs. Honey drew up the invitation, and\r\nthe signatures were affixed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  EDNA RUTHERFORD.

In a short time he brought back a verbal acceptance of\r\nthe invitation.\r\n\r\nMrs. Honey had constituted herself leader of the feminine discontents.\r\nWhen they were marshalled in the dining-room, awaiting their guests, she\r\nthus addressed them:\r\n\r\n\"Ladies, now let us preserve a calm, cold, and dignified demeanor, so as\r\nto let them understand that we have simply taken compassion upon them,\r\nnot as husbands, but as men, and in the name of a common humanity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly,\" assented Mrs. Rutherford. \"No beggar, especially at this\r\nseason, should be turned away either cold or hungry from my door.\"\r\n\r\nThe speech addressed by Mr. Rutherford to his friends and partners in\r\nadversity was quite in consonance with that uttered by Mrs. Honey.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" said he, \"do not let us show elation or be too eager to\r\nforgive our wives, but bear ourselves as just men who, having received\r\novertures for peace, are willing to grant proper consideration to\r\nproffered terms of capitulation.\"\r\n\r\nFollowing their host, Wildfen and Honey supported between them Mr.\r\nPlowden, who when he entered the dining-room seemed much cheered by the\r\nabsence of Miss Fithian. No word was spoken as the husbands entered, and\r\nin stern silence each retook the seat he had occupied on Christmas Eve.\r\nThe turkey--a grand bird, yellow-meated and tender from fattening on\r\nEnglish walnuts--had been served and eaten in silence.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Sam ushered in a shivering telegraph-boy, with a message for\r\nMr. Rutherford. When the diners were left alone again, the host arose\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n\"Friends, last evening you heard made against me a charge which I was,\r\nat the time, bound in honor not to refute. It fortunately happens that\r\nyou are all present to hear my exculpation. First let me read this\r\ntelegram: 'Your message received by fortunate accident. Tell everything.\r\nNo further need for secrecy. Mother dead two months. Daughter with\r\nme.--_Charles Wilbour._' Now for the solution of it. I inherited my\r\nfather's practice, and some odd clients he had. Among them was a\r\ngentleman who had made a secret marriage, for which his wealthy mother,\r\nif she had known of it, would have disinherited him. It was effectually\r\nconcealed, and he had a daughter pretty well grown when I had anything\r\nto do with the case. His wife had died but a little while before. He\r\nwas recalled home to his mother, whose health was believed to be\r\nfailing, and knowing that he would have to remain there some time, he\r\nwished his child put in a boarding-school, as a place of safe care for\r\nher, and under a false name, to still conceal her identity while his\r\nmother lived. He came to me, as his lawyer, to so dispose of her, under\r\na solemn pledge of my word of honor that I would keep his secret. That\r\nwas the girl I confided to Mrs. Honey, and her father was Mr. Wilbour,\r\nthe signer of the telegram I have just read. Further documentary\r\nevidence, if needed, is in my office.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Malcolm! forgive me!\" cried his wife, throwing herself into his\r\narms.\r\n\r\nSam entered in time to be both amazed and delighted by this tableau.\r\nWhen he could claim his master's attention, he drew him aside and told\r\nhim in an undertone:\r\n\r\n\"Dat strange ole woman what come hyer las' night done come agin, sah.\r\nShe outside 'n' say she jes want to see you a minnit, but she mus' see\r\nyou. She say she got lettahs fo' you, sah, 'n' wun't gib 'em to nubbudy\r\nelse.\"\r\n\r\n\"Show her in here, Sam.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sah.\"\r\n\r\nRutherford had raised his voice in giving the order, and Plowden looked\r\nup at him inquiringly as Sam left the room. The lawyer bent down to him\r\nand whispered: \"Mrs. Plowden, Number One.\"\r\n\r\nThe unhappy old man half arose, pallid with a sudden scare, and looked\r\nas if he meditated going through the window again; but before he could\r\ndo so, Sam returned, ushering in a stout elderly woman. At sight of her,\r\nPlowden sank back in his seat, and his face gave evidence of lively\r\nemotion, but the feeling it expressed was astonishment rather than\r\nconsternation.\r\n\r\n\"Are you Mrs. Robert Plowden?\" demanded Mr. Rutherford.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir; that's my name,\" the new-comer replied.\r\n\r\nYoung Honey, who had been sitting with his back to her, and indeed had\r\nnot even noticed her coming in, jumped up at sound of her voice, turned\r\nand confronted her, with a cry of--\r\n\r\n\"Mother!\"\r\n\r\nThe woman seemed to shrink and cower, as if overcome, not by fear, but\r\nby shame at sight of him, and whined: \"Oh, Billy! Hi didn't know you was\r\n'ere hagain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why are _you_ 'ere, mother?\"\r\n\r\nShe hesitated, stammered, seemed as if she would have turned and fled,\r\nhad not the stern demand in his glance detained her.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't think it was hany 'arm,\" she whimpered; \"I 'ated so to be\r\ndependent hon you an' 'Arriet--an' 'e's so rich.\"\r\n\r\nThe honest fellow's face flushed crimson, tears dimmed his eyes, and his\r\nvoice trembled, as he said, in tones not of anger, but of deep sorrow:\r\n\"Oh, mother! 'ow could you? Poor an' hignorant we hallways was--which\r\nhit was hower condition--'ard, but not dishonest--and nothink hever for\r\nto be hashamed of huntil now. Oh, mother, you've broke my 'art!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, my boy,\" impulsively exclaimed the good-hearted Plowden,\r\nhurriedly rising, coming to him and laying a hand on his shoulder,\r\n\"don't feel so. I can understand better than you how desperately one may\r\nfeel who is poor as well as old. Sister-in-law Sally, I forgive you; for\r\nif you have raised a ghost--that has put some gray hairs in my head in\r\nthe last twenty-four hours, I think--you have also laid it, and forever.\r\nYes, Sally, I forgive you with all my heart; and if you want to be\r\nindependent and go back to England, I'll give you enough to enable you\r\nto do so.\"\r\n\r\nShe was sobbing, too much overcome to reply in words, and could only bow\r\nover and kiss the kind hand that he extended to her. Then she turned\r\ntoward the door, and her son led her out. Rutherford called to him as he\r\nwent, \"You must return, Honey,\" and he nodded assent. Mrs. Honey, pale\r\nand silent, followed them to the vestibule. After a short absence she\r\nreturned with her husband. Tinkling sharp and clear in the crisp wintry\r\nair, they heard the bells on the horses that carried the old woman away.\r\nFainter and fainter became the sound until it died away in the distance,\r\nand then the cloud lifted, as if by magic, from over the house-party,\r\nand at last \"Merry Christmas\" came for them.\r\n\r\n  CELIA LOGAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A CHRYSTMESSE WYSHE._\r\n\r\n\r\n  There be\r\n  A wyshe I have for Thee\r\n    Thys Chrystmesse-tyde:\r\n      Maye Joye, and alle Gladde thynges\r\n      The seasonne brynges,\r\n  Gette to Thee\r\n  And Abyde.\r\n\r\n  WM. HALLISTER WALL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_DEAD-SHOT DAN._\"[A]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Come, Dan, old man, it's your turn now.\"\r\n\r\nThis remark was made by one of a group of miners seated in front of a\r\ncamp-fire in San Mateo canyon on the Colorado.\r\n\r\nThe person addressed as Dan was a splendid specimen of a \"frontiersman,\"\r\nhaving all the characteristics of a frank, free American, with the\r\nphysical advantages of a stalwart \"Englisher.\" Among the miners he was\r\nvariously known as \"English Dan\" and \"Dead-Shot Dan.\" How he got the\r\nlatter nickname always seemed a puzzle to his comrades, for he was one\r\nof the best, gentlest, and kindest fellows on \"the lode.\" His manners\r\nand appearance indicated anything but a wicked nature, and he was always\r\nready to do a comrade a good turn, or act as peacemaker in the\r\never-recurring rows of the miners.\r\n\r\nIt was Christmas Eve, and the boys were gathered around the fire,\r\nsmoking their pipes, and telling stories of their past lives. Some told\r\nof homes and loved ones in the far-distant States; some of the late\r\nCivil War and its scenes of strife and sorrow; and some of escapades\r\nwith the Mexican \"greasers\" and cattle-thieves of the Rio Grande.\r\n\r\nNow the crowd turned to Dan, whom they regarded as a sort of superior\r\ncreature. He was a general favorite. He knew something of medicine, and\r\nhad nursed and cured many a comrade of camp-fever. He had, on more than\r\none occasion, even set a limb and extracted a bullet from a\r\nwound--attentions which undoubtedly had the effect of increasing the\r\nfreedom of the miners in the use of the \"seven-shooter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, Dan, it's your turn now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" shouted a dozen voices. \"Give us a story, English.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not much of a story-teller, boys,\" said Dan; \"can anybody suggest a\r\nsubject?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" exclaimed old Peleg Carter, the Nestor of the crowd, \"I can\r\nsuggest a subject.\"\r\n\r\nPeleg was a Missouri man. He was over six feet high, and had gray hair,\r\nwhile his large and flabby ears stood out from his head like the side\r\nlamps of a hansom cab. He had only one eye, and he boasted that he had\r\nlost the other in driving Joe Smith and the Mormons from \"Nauvoo.\" His\r\nword was law in the economy of the camp, so that when he said he could\r\nsuggest a subject to Dan, all the lads waited with awe and attention to\r\nhear what the subject would be.\r\n\r\n\"Well, old man,\" observed Dan, \"start the subject, and I'll do my best.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell us, then,\" said Peleg, \"how you got the name of 'Dead-Shot Dan.'\r\nYou never wear a weaping, unless you keep one underneath your jumper.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Dan, \"I don't carry a weapon. I carried a pistol once, but\r\nswore I'd never 'bear arms,' again. Well, lads,\" he continued, as he\r\nfilled his pipe, \"you want to know how I got the name of 'Dead-Shot\r\nDan'?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" was the unanimous response.\r\n\r\n\"I must tell you, then, that I came to Colorado, not exactly a fugitive\r\nfrom justice, but the victim of what is called in civilized countries\r\nthe 'code of honor.' I was an assistant-surgeon on board one of the\r\n'Quintard Line' of steamers, sailing from Liverpool to the\r\nMediterranean. On my first voyage we put in for passengers and coal at\r\nMarseilles. We had forty-eight hours to remain in port, and as I was\r\nanxious to see all I could of foreign parts, I went ashore early in the\r\nmorning. My companion was the senior surgeon of the ship, a strange,\r\nhot-headed old fellow. He had formerly been a surgeon in the Royal Navy,\r\nbut had been cashiered while on the West Indian station for challenging\r\nthe admiral on account of some supposed affront. His name was Dr.\r\nCaldwell, and he was sometimes known as the 'Fire-eating Surgeon.' Both\r\nof us, being very hungry when we got on shore, thought we would have a\r\njolly good breakfast before visiting the objects of interest in the\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\"'Come with me, Dan,' said the Doctor, 'and I will take you to a famous\r\nrestaurant frequented by all the savants of the city. Astronomers and\r\npolitical economists go there, and Italian refugees and communists too.\r\nFrenchmen rarely have more than a crust of bread and a cup of coffee\r\nbefore noon; but if the frog-eaters have such a thing in their larder,\r\nwe'll have a beefsteak or a brace of chops.'\r\n\r\n\"With that he led me into a quiet side street, and we soon reached the\r\nrestaurant. Early as it was, the principal dining-room was filled with\r\ncustomers sipping their coffee, and I could see at a glance that they\r\nwere of no common order. They appeared to form a kind of literary class.\r\n\r\n\"We took our seats at a table which was already occupied by an old\r\nFrench gentleman, with a mustache and beard of a decidedly military cut.\r\n\r\n\"'Two large beefsteaks!' shouted the Doctor, in a voice which attracted\r\nthe attention of everyone in the room.\r\n\r\n\"The waiter looked at us as if we were lunatics escaped from an asylum,\r\nand said, in broken English, '_Messieurs_, this is not the time for\r\nbeefsteaks. Beefsteaks are at twelve o'clock. 'Tis now only half-past\r\neight.'\r\n\r\n\"'Two beefsteaks, d'ye hear!' again roared the Doctor.\r\n\r\n\"'Certainlee, if _messieurs_ will have it so,' replied the waiter,\r\nsomewhat staggered.\r\n\r\n\"'Beefsteak! Beefsteak!! Beefsteak!!!' was the exclamation which went\r\nfrom one person to another around the room, and all eyes were turned\r\ntowards us.\r\n\r\n\"'Look,' said the Doctor, 'how these French fools stare. Confound them!\r\nWhat do they mean?'\r\n\r\n\"'Pardon me, sare,' remarked the old gentleman at our table, addressing\r\nhimself to me, 'ess zis your breakfast or your dinnaire?'\r\n\r\n\"'Don't answer him,' said the Doctor; 'we'll have some sport with these\r\nfellows.'\r\n\r\n\"The beefsteaks were brought, and we attacked them with great effect.\r\n\r\n\"'It must be ze dinnaire,' muttered our military friend to himself, just\r\nloud enough for us to hear.\r\n\r\n\"'Pardon me, gentlemen,' he again said, addressing himself to me in a\r\nlouder tone, 'ess zis your breakfast or your dinnaire?'\r\n\r\n\"'Bring some fried eggs,' called out the Doctor, before I could answer.\r\n\r\n\"'_Oui, messieurs_,' replied the waiter, quickly darting into the\r\nkitchen.\r\n\r\n\"'Oh, it must be ze dinnaire,' again muttered our old friend opposite;\r\n'certainlee, it must be ze dinnaire.'\r\n\r\n\"The eggs were brought and soon despatched. The old Frenchman looked\r\naghast.\r\n\r\n\"'Pardon me once more, my dear young friend,' he said, 'ess zis your\r\nbreakfast or your dinnaire?'\r\n\r\n\"The Doctor winked at me not to answer, and called out, 'Waiter! two\r\nmore cups of tea!'\r\n\r\n\"The old Frenchman looked at his watch and said despairingly, 'Oh, it\r\nmust be ze dinnaire. Dinnaire at half-past eight! _Mon Dieu!_ Howevaire,\r\nI will ask once more. My dear sare, ess zis your breakfast or your\r\ndinnaire?'\r\n\r\n\"'Sir,' I replied, somewhat petulantly, 'we came here to eat, not to\r\nanswer questions!'\r\n\r\n\"'Yes, sare, but I am a journalist, and am anxious to study ze\r\ncharacteristics of ze Engleesh; zerefore, I ask, ess zis your breakfast\r\nor your dinnaire?'\r\n\r\n\"'Bring more toast, waiter,' said the Doctor.\r\n\r\n\"'More tost! Ah, it ess ze dinnaire--must be ze dinnaire,' mumbled the\r\nold Frenchman.\r\n\r\n\"The toast and tea disposed of, we rose and paid our bill. We were about\r\nto leave the restaurant, when the old Frenchman quitted the table, as if\r\nfor the purpose of having a parting shot at us. Just as we were stepping\r\ninto the street, he tapped me on the shoulder, and making a polite bow,\r\nsaid, 'Sare, if you please, was zat your breakfast or your dinnaire?'\r\n\r\n\"This seemed too much for human nature to bear, and without thinking\r\nexactly what I was about, I threw my glove into his face.\r\n\r\n\"'Sare, what you mean? An insult?'\r\n\r\n\"'Yes,' said the Doctor, 'and another, if you like. We have stood your\r\nimpertinence for the last half-hour. You are no gentleman.'\r\n\r\n\"'Sare? No gentleman? Zare is my card!'\r\n\r\n\"'And there is mine,' said the Doctor.\r\n\r\n\"'One at a time, my friends,' coolly replied the old man. 'My business\r\nis wiz zis young gentleman first. He has struck me wiz his glove! He\r\nmust fight.'\r\n\r\n\"'Agreed,' said the Doctor. 'Send your friend to me. I shall be happy to\r\nassist this young gentleman, and to fight you myself afterwards.'\r\n\r\n\"'One moment, gentlemen. My friend, Colonel Monier, now at yonder table,\r\nwill confer wiz you;' and the old fellow called to his friend.\r\n\r\n\"In a few moments arrangements were perfected for a meeting between the\r\nFrenchman and myself the next morning at daylight, at a small clump of\r\ntrees a few miles from town. Weapons, pistols; distance, fifteen paces.\r\n\r\n\"'Don't be alarmed, Dan,' said the Doctor, as we were going on board our\r\nship; 'I'll teach you how to wing the frog-eater. Wing him, my boy! Wing\r\nhim! I've done the trick a dozen times!'\r\n\r\n\"Next morning the Doctor, Tom Wallace, our purser, and myself drove to\r\nthe place appointed for the meeting, and found the French party already\r\non the ground.\r\n\r\n\"'Cheer up, Dan,' said my second, 'and remember, aim for his left\r\nshoulder. You'll wing him like a pigeon. Those Frenchmen know nothing of\r\nfire-arms.'\r\n\r\n\"The preliminaries over, we took our positions. I must confess I was\r\nterribly nervous; but while I intended to merely wound my adversary, I\r\ndetermined to follow the advice of the Doctor, and 'aim for the left\r\nshoulder.'\r\n\r\n\"'Are you ready?'\r\n\r\n\"'Ready.'\r\n\r\n\"'Fire.'\r\n\r\n\"'One.'\r\n\r\n\"'Two.'\r\n\r\n\"'Three.'\r\n\r\n\"It had been arranged that we should fire between the words 'One' and\r\n'Three;' and as the word 'Two' was on the lips of the second, I fired.\r\n\r\n\"'Oh, _mon Dieu!_' cried my opponent, falling bleeding into the arms of\r\nhis second, as the bullet from his pistol almost grazed my cheek.\r\n\r\n\"'_Parbleu!_ He is dying--shot through the heart. You are a surgeon; can\r\nyou do anything for him?' said I, appealing to my friend, the Doctor.\r\n\r\n\"'No, my lad,' said he; 'you aimed too low.'\r\n\r\n\"'This is terrible,' I cried, now for the first time realizing the awful\r\nposition in which I was placed. 'What can we do?'\r\n\r\n\"'Get across the frontier as soon as possible,' was the advice of the\r\nold Frenchman's second.\r\n\r\n\"'Our ship sails at noon,' said the Doctor.\r\n\r\n\"I advanced to the dying man, whose life-blood was pouring from his\r\nside, and with tears streaming down my face, begged his forgiveness. He\r\nopened his poor, sad eyes, now almost glazed in death.\r\n\r\n\"'Oh, speak to me!' cried I, 'if only one word. I would give the world\r\nto recall this wicked duel. Is there anything on earth that I can do\r\nfor you or yours? Tell me, and on the honor of an English gentleman, I\r\nwill do as you command.'\r\n\r\n\"'Ah, my young friend,' said the dying man, 'I feel that I have but a\r\nfew minutes to live. I am dying even while I speak; but I shall die\r\nperfectly happy if you will tell me whether _zat was your breakfast or\r\nyour dinnaire_?'\"\r\n\r\n  WILLIAM J.

To sight-seekers from \"the States\" who during the\r\nlast three years have visited Halifax this ecclesiastical building has\r\nbecome a place of especial interest. An ancestor of President Cleveland\r\nwas the first pastor of the society; and through the influence of Rev.\r\nAaron Cleveland, the first non-conforming church in British North\r\nAmerica was built. It stood at the corner of the present Hollis and\r\nPrince streets, upon what now is the site of the Halifax Club, a portion\r\nof the building being occupied by Doull & Miller's dry-goods store.\r\n\r\nThere the little structure remained for more than a century, although\r\nMr. Cleveland's ministry extended over but five years, when, in 1755,\r\nthe pioneer pastor removed to England, leaving behind him no church\r\nrecords. Hence the history of Congregationalism in Nova Scotia, during\r\nthat period, is traditional. A few volumes, unique in style and huge in\r\nsize, the nucleus of what to-day is the Church and Sunday-school library\r\nof St. Matthew's society, survived the pastor's departure. Many of the\r\nbooks were the gift of Mr. Cleveland. In some of them is preserved his\r\nautograph presentation. A large proportion of the other volumes were\r\ndonated by friends of Mr. Cleveland, mostly residents of Great Britain.\r\nOf these the notable ones are:\r\n\r\n     A Large and Complete Concordance to the Bible, by Samuel Newman,\r\n     now teacher of the church at Rehoboth in New England. London, 1650.\r\n\r\nThe presentation reads as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"This book is the Gift to the present Minister of the Gospel at\r\n     Halifax in Nova Scotia, and to his successors,\r\n\r\n             By their well wisher and Humble Servant\r\n\r\n  Nov. 6, 1750.

In a letter dated July 10, 1750, to The Lords\r\nCommissioners for Trade and Plantations, written by Hon. Edward\r\nCornwallace, Governor of Nova Scotia, the \"Meeting-house\" was grouped as\r\none of the \"necessary works,\" with \"a Court House and Prison, and a\r\npowder Magazine.\"\r\n\r\nAt the time of Mr. Cleveland's ministry in Halifax, \"The Dissenting\r\nCongregational Meeting-house\" was known as \"Mather's Church.\" It derived\r\nits name from the then famous New England Congregational divine, Cotton\r\nMather. The frame of the building was brought from Boston. Tradition\r\nerroneously says that the edifice was removed bodily to Halifax, and\r\nthat it was the identical church in which Cotton Mather preached.\r\n\r\nAfter the fire, January 1, 1857, that destroyed the original structure,\r\nthe present St. Matthew's church edifice was erected. The building,\r\nwhich is of brick, is the best of its kind in the Dominion. Its cost of\r\nconstruction was $75,000. The manse was built at an additional expense\r\nof $12,000. The congregation is fashionable and influential. The Word is\r\npreached from an old-fashioned box-like pulpit, perched, like a bird's\r\nnest, near the ceiling. The minister reaches this enclosure by means of\r\ntwo winding stairways, curtained with red drapery along their sides.\r\nThe pews are, as in ancient times, padded throughout with scarlet.\r\nBritish \"red-coats\" constitute a portion of the congregation. They\r\noccupy the high gallery that reaches around three sides of the\r\nauditorium. The Sunday-school is one of the largest and the best\r\nconducted in the city. The original silver-plate communion-set and the\r\nbaptismal fount have been preserved and are used as occasion allows.\r\nThese pieces are engraved with the follow inscription:\r\n\r\n     \"The Gift of Francis White, Esq., to the first Protestant\r\n     Dissenting Church in Halifax, Oct. 25, 1769.\"\r\n\r\nA prominent officer of the St. Matthew's Society stated in the presence\r\nof the writer, \"We have many proofs that the Lord has abundantly blessed\r\nthe labors of the first minister, the Rev. Aaron Cleveland, ... and we\r\nrejoice in the manifestation of His goodness in having raised his\r\ndescendant to the highest honor in the gift of a free and sovereign\r\npeople.\"\r\n\r\nTo the town of Cleveland,--\"a corruption of Cliffe land,\"--Durham\r\nCounty, England, the family of Cleveland or Cleaveland owes its name.\r\n\"The principal branch was seated in the county of York. Early in the\r\nfourteenth century, Sir Guy de Cleveland was present at the siege of\r\nBoulogne, in France, and afterwards at the battle of Poietiers, where he\r\ncommanded the spearmen. A branch of the family went into Devonshire, and\r\ncontinued until the male line of the family was extinct.\"\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Aaron Cleveland, great-great-grandfather to the President of\r\nthe United States, was the son of Captain Aaron, a grandchild of Moses\r\nCleveland who came to this country from Ipswich, county of Suffolk,\r\nEngland, about 1635, and who died at Woburn, Mass., January, 1701-2.\r\nSeven sons and five daughters composed the family of Moses. From the\r\neldest son, \"it is confidently believed, are derived all the Clevelands\r\nor Cleavelands in this country, of New England origin.\" The other of the\r\ntwo brothers who came to this country settled in Ohio. One of them,\r\nGeneral Moses Cleveland, was born 1754, in Canterbury, Connecticut. He\r\ngraduated from Yale College, and subsequently held a position as general\r\nin the regular army. Afterwards he practised law. As chief of the staff\r\nof surveyors commissioned by the Connecticut Land Company, he was sent\r\nto the Western Reserve, where he secured the confidence and friendship\r\nof the Indians by his tact and repeated evidences of friendliness. He\r\nestablished a surveying camp, laid out a city, and gave to it his name.\r\nIt was to his memory that the Early Settlers Association of Cleveland,\r\nOhio, celebrated the ninety-second anniversary of this event by\r\nunveiling, in the public square, the 22d of last July, a bronze statue\r\nof the city's founder.\r\n\r\n\"The brother who settled in New England had two sons, one of whom\r\nremoved to Michigan, the other to New York. From the family of the\r\nlatter sprung the President.\"\r\n\r\nThe following epitaph immortalizes the memory of Colonel Aaron\r\nCleveland, who is buried in the Congregational graveyard at Canterbury,\r\nConn.:\r\n\r\n     \"In memory of Col. Aaron Cleveland, who died in a fit of apoplexy,\r\n     14th April, A.D., 1785. Born 7th of Decr. 1727; on the 17th of\r\n     June, A.D. 1782, when in the bloom of health and prime of life, was\r\n     struck with a numb palsy; from that time to his death, had upward\r\n     of sixty fits of the palsy and apoplexy. He was employed in sundry\r\n     honorable offices both civil and military.\r\n\r\n     \"Calm and composed my soul her journey takes,\r\n     No guilt that troubles, and no heart that aches.\r\n     Adieu! thou Sun, all bright like her arise,\r\n     Adieu! dear friends, and all that's good and wise.\"\r\n\r\nRev. Aaron Cleveland, the Halifax minister, was the fifth son and the\r\nseventh child of Captain Aaron Cleveland. He was born in Cambridge,\r\nMass., 1715. He studied and graduated at Harvard College, and was\r\nmarried to Susanna Porter, a daughter of Rev. Aaron Porter, of Medford,\r\nMass., the same year, when but twenty years of age. Four years later,\r\n1739, he was called to the pastorate of a congregation at Haddam,\r\nConnecticut, where he continued until dismissed for alleged heterodoxy.\r\n\r\nA year later Mr. Cleveland was installed over a congregation at Malden.\r\nHis views being there deemed too liberal, he was obliged to resign that\r\ncharge also. This circumstance occurred in 1750, the same year in which\r\nhe went to Halifax. Falling into disrepute once more, because of his too\r\nrapid advance in theological tenets, he was forced to give up the Nova\r\nScotia pastorate. The same year, 1755, he removed to England. He\r\nsubsequently disconnected himself from the denomination of his early\r\nchoice, and took holy orders in the Church of England from Bishop\r\nSherlock, of London, from which denomination he received the following\r\ncommission:\r\n\r\n     \"CHARTER HOUSE, JULY 1, 1767--Good Gentlemen: The society for the\r\n     propagation of the gospel in foreign parts have granted your\r\n     request and appointed Mr. Cleveland their missionary in your\r\n     church; but it is on the express condition, which is now a standing\r\n     rule in their missions, that you provide him with a good house and\r\n     glebe, and not less than twenty pounds sterling per annum, towards\r\n     his more comfortable support. Heartily recommending you and Mr.\r\n     Cleveland to God's blessing, I am, sirs, your very faithful, humble\r\n     servant,\r\n\r\n     PHILIP BEARCROFT.\r\n\r\n     To the church wardens and vestry of the episcopal church of New\r\n     Castle, in Pennsylvania.\"\r\n\r\nReturning to America, he officiated at Lewes, Delaware, and at New\r\nCastle, Pennsylvania, until his death, which occurred suddenly at\r\nPhiladelphia, August 11, 1757, while he was visiting his friend Benjamin\r\nFranklin, but two years after his removal from Halifax. _The\r\nPennsylvania Gazette_, at that time owned and edited by Franklin,\r\ncontained the following obituary--a sober paragraph amidst the bountiful\r\nsupply of wit and ridicule with which that journal abounded.\r\n\r\n     \"On Thursday last, the 11th, died here the Rev. Mr. Cleveland,\r\n     lately appointed to the mission of New Castle, by the society for\r\n     the propagation of the gospel. As he was a gentleman of humane and\r\n     pious disposition, indefatigable in his ministry, easy and affable\r\n     in his conversation, open and sincere to his friends, and above\r\n     every specie of meanness and dissimulation, his death is greatly\r\n     lamented by all who knew him, as a loss to the public, a loss to\r\n     the church of Christ in general, and in particular to that\r\n     congregation who had proposed to themselves so much satisfaction\r\n     from his late appointment among them, agreeable to their own\r\n     request.\"\r\n\r\nDuring Mr. Cleveland's residence in Nova Scotia three children were born\r\nto him, they being the last of a family of ten. All these survived the\r\nfather's death. The widow removed to Salem, Massachusetts, and there\r\nmade a future home for her children and herself. Aided by a relative,\r\nJudge Stephen Sewell, Mrs. Cleveland supported her family in comfort and\r\nrespectability until the time of her death, in 1788. Aaron (5th), who\r\nwas also the fifth of the children, was born in Haddam, Conn., February\r\n3, 1744. He lived in Halifax with his parents from his sixth to his\r\neleventh year. He became a member of the legislature of Connecticut in\r\n1799. Subsequently he followed the early calling of his father and\r\nbecame a Congregational minister, and was known throughout New England\r\nas a statesman, an orator, and a wit. Twice married, this Aaron (5th)\r\nwas the father of William, one of fifteen children. Said William was\r\ngrandfather to President Cleveland.\r\n\r\nAaron was a poet. He never claimed to be such, and the few verses that\r\nhe allowed to find their way into print were published anonymously. Many\r\nof them have been lost. The authorship of others was never given to the\r\npublic. A few, however, of his poetic word-creations passed into the\r\npossession of his grandson, the Rev. Arthur Cleveland Coxe, of Hartford.\r\nIllustrating Mr. Cleveland's appreciation of personal merit and personal\r\nexertion over that of ancestry, we insert the following satirical\r\ncomposition from his pen:\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FAMILY BLOOD: A BURLESQUE.\r\n\r\n    \"_Genus et proavos et quod non fecimus ipsi\r\n  Vix ea nostra voco._\"\r\n\r\n    Four kinds of blood flow in my veins,\r\n  And govern, each in turn, my brains.\r\n  From CLEVELAND, PORTER, SEWELL, WATERS,\r\n  I had my parentage in quarters;\r\n  My fathers' fathers' names I know,\r\n  And further back no doubt might go.\r\n  Compound on compound from the flood,\r\n  Makes up my old ancestral blood;\r\n  But what my sires of old time were,\r\n  I neither wish to know, nor care.\r\n  Some might be wise--and others fools;\r\n  Some might be tyrants--others tools;\r\n  Some might have wealth, and others lack;\r\n  Some fair perchance--some almost black;\r\n  No matter what in days of yore,\r\n  Since now they're known and seen no more.\r\n\r\n    The name of CLEVELAND I must wear,\r\n  Which any fondling too might bear:\r\n  PORTER, they say, from Scotland came,\r\n  A bonny Laird of ancient fame:\r\n  SEWELL--of English derivation,\r\n  Perhaps was outlaw from the nation;\r\n  And _Waters_--Irish as I ween,\r\n  _Straight--round-about_ from--_Aberdeen!_\r\n\r\n    Such is my heterogeneous blood,\r\n  A motley mixture, bad and good:\r\n  Each blood aspires to rule alone,\r\n  And each in turn ascends the throne,\r\n  Of its poor realm to wear the crown,\r\n  And reign till next one tears him down.\r\n  Each change must twist about my brains,\r\n  And move my tongue in different strains;\r\n  My mental powers are captive led,\r\n  As whim or wisdom rules the head;\r\n  My character no one can know,\r\n  For none I have while things are so;\r\n  I'm something--nothing, wise, or fool,\r\n  As suits the blood that haps to rule.\r\n  When CLEVELAND reigns I'm thought a wit\r\n  In giving words the funny hit;\r\n  And social glee and humorous song\r\n  Delight the fools that round me throng;\r\n  Till PORTER puts on the crown,\r\n  And hauls the CLEVELAND banner down.\r\n\r\n    Now all is calm, discreet, and wise,\r\n  Whate'er I do, whate'er devise;\r\n  What common sence and wisdom teach,\r\n  Directs my actions, forms my speech;\r\n  The wise and good around me stay,\r\n  And laughing dunces hie away.\r\n    But soon, alas, this happy vein\r\n  May for some other change again!\r\n  SEWELL perchance shall next bear rule:\r\n  I'm now a philosophic fool!\r\n  With JEFFERSON I correspond,\r\n  And sail with him, the stars beyond:\r\n  Each nerve and fibre of my brain,\r\n  To sense profound I nicely strain,\r\n  And thus uprise beyond the ken\r\n  Of common sence and common men.\r\n\r\n    Thus great am I, till SEWELL'S crown\r\n  About my ears comes tumbling down.\r\n  Wise fools may soar themselves above,\r\n  And dream in rapturous spheres they move;\r\n  But airy castles must recoil,\r\n  And such wild imagery spoil.\r\n\r\n    But who comes now? Alas! 'tis _Waters_,\r\n  Rushing and blustering to headquarters:\r\n  He knows nor manners nor decorum,\r\n  But elbows headlong to the forum;\r\n  Uncouth and odd, abrupt and bold,\r\n  Unteachable and uncontrolled,\r\n  Devoid of wisdom, sence, or wit,\r\n  Not one thing right he ever hit,\r\n  Unless, by accident, not skill,\r\n  He blundered right against his will.\r\n\r\n    And such am I! no transmigration\r\n  Can sink me to a lower station:\r\n  Come, PORTER, come depose the clown,\r\n  And, once for all, possess the crown.\r\n  If aught, in SEWELL'S blood, you find\r\n  Will make your own still more refined;\r\n  If found in CLEVELAND'S blood, a trait\r\n  To aid you in affairs of state;\r\n  Select such parts--and spurn the rest,\r\n  No more to rule in brain or breast.\r\n  Of WATERS' blood expel the whole,\r\n  Let not one drop pollute my soul:\r\n  Then rule my head--and keep my heart\r\n  From folly, weakness, wit apart:\r\n  With all such gifts I glad dispense,\r\n  But only leave me--COMMON SENSE.\r\n\r\nAs a wit, Mr. Cleveland's reputation has been immortalized by a few\r\nsentences that are frequently quoted, and which the writer furnished to\r\nthe Editor's Drawer, _Harper's Monthly Magazine_, August, 1885. Mr.\r\nCleveland was a Federalist of the school of Jay and Hamilton, whom he\r\nsupported with more than ordinary zeal, and perhaps not without\r\nsomething of the prejudice which ranked all Jeffersonians with French\r\nfatalists and infidels. On horseback one day Mr. Cleveland was riding\r\nfrom Middletown to Durham; a little stream bounded the limits of the\r\ntownships. He halted to water his horse; meanwhile a young man, having\r\ncome from the opposite direction, drew rein so suddenly in the midst of\r\nthe brook as to render the water unfit to drink.\r\n\r\n\"Good-morning, Mr. Minister,\" said the youth.\r\n\r\n\"Good-morning, Mr. Democrat,\" replied the reverend gentleman.\r\n\r\n\"And pray why do you take me for a Democrat?\" queried the young man.\r\n\r\n\"Pray why did you take me for a minister?\" rejoined Mr. Cleveland.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" said the fellow, \"that is plain enough--by your _dress_.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that you are a Democrat is plain enough by your _address_,\" was the\r\nretort of the preacher.\r\n\r\nMr. Cleveland was buried in New Haven, Conn., where he died suddenly,\r\nwhile paying a visit to friends in that city. He lies in the \"New Haven\r\nCity Burial Ground,\" the first cemetery in this country that was divided\r\ninto family lots. The plot in which Mr. Cleveland was interred was at\r\nthat time owned by Edmund French. Recently it was resold to William\r\nFranklin, a proviso of the transfer being that all previous interments\r\nshould forever remain undisturbed. Two massive stones, of veinless white\r\nmarble, mark the head and the foot of the scarcely perceptible mound.\r\nThey are low and unpretentious. The larger is about two feet in height;\r\nthe smaller is proportionally less tall. Erected but a short time ago,\r\nit is said that President Cleveland ordered them that he might mark the\r\nlast earthly resting-place of his great-grandfather. The inscription\r\nreads:\r\n\r\n  REV. AARON CLEVELAND\r\n  SON OF\r\n  REV. AARON CLEVELAND\r\n\r\n  BORN IN HADDAM FEB'Y 3. 1744\r\n  DIED IN NEW HAVEN SEPT. 21. 1815\r\n\r\nA much loved, and respected, and stainless name is the inheritance that\r\nthis man has left to his descendants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE SOLDIERS' DAY AT SHILOH._\r\n\r\n\r\n  The wives and little ones at home who knelt one Sabbath morn,\r\n  And prayed for God to save our land, with battles rent and torn,\r\n  How little knew the quick reply, while yet they bent the knee,\r\n  In Shiloh's fierce and stubborn strife beside the Tennessee!\r\n  Oh, may they never cease to pray for our dear nation's good.\r\n  Till wrong no more shall lift a hand to claim the price of blood!\r\n  For heavy was the debt we paid in noble blood and true,\r\n  When Slavery cast the gage of war between the gray and blue.\r\n\r\n  Bright burst the dawn o'er Shiloh's field, as o'er the northland homes;\r\n  As o'er the worshippers that rose to seek their shining domes;\r\n  And gentle morn, that whispered low and woke the sleepers there,\r\n  Had almost led the soldier back the Sabbath joys to share,\r\n  When, lo! a murmur through the trees above the breezes came,\r\n  And shook the forest in our front with thunder-sound and flame!\r\n  Now all the dreams of peace and home in quick surprise dispelled;\r\n  Adown the line and far away the clamor rose and swelled!\r\n\r\n  Defenceless on a field of war--'tis terrible in thought!\r\n  Then how the holy morn was changed for those who blindly fought!\r\n  At breakfast fire and forming line, their life-blood stained the green;\r\n  Before them flashed a fiery storm; behind, the river's sheen!\r\n  The army smitten in its camps, though flinching, rallied soon,\r\n  And steady rose the battle's roar on that red field ere noon,\r\n  While, mindful of their sad neglect, up came our generals then--\r\n  Alas! they could not form in rank the dead and dying men!\r\n  Against a crushing battle-tide right well we fought our ground;\r\n  Full oft the foe that smote our ranks the soldiers' welcome found.\r\n  That day the swaying underbrush a reaper, all unseen,\r\n  Smote with the battle's deadly breath as with a sickle keen;\r\n  The scorner of the widow's wail, the orphans' sore lament,\r\n  There gathered treasure in his grasp, from hut and mansion sent.\r\n  With deadly volleys crashing near, the cannons roll afar,\r\n  That Sabbath closed on Shiloh's field, a bloody scene of war.\r\n\r\n  Ere long the thrilling scenes will fade, the veterans will depart;\r\n  But ere we leave the land; my child, write this upon thy heart:\r\n  No soaring genius labored there to guide the stubborn fight--\r\n  That was the common soldier's day from morning dawn till night;\r\n  His stinging volleys checked the foe and laid their leader cold,\r\n  As ever near with gleaming front the wave of battle rolled.\r\n  Until the western sun was low and succor reached the field,\r\n  Madly they pressed the volunteers, Columbia's pride and shield.\r\n\r\n  The trump of fame has sounded long for those who led us then,\r\n  And echoes still where poets sing the praise of mighty men.\r\n  But where the commoner is found beneath his household tree,\r\n  The soldier's heavy tramp is heard, the bayonet's gleam we see!\r\n  Ah! never more in knightly ranks will nations put their trust,\r\n  And soon the fabled hero's sword will gather mould and rust:\r\n  As war disclosed the true defence in man's unarmored breast,\r\n  So has it shown a nation's strength above the dazzling crest.\r\n\r\n  The stars of union raise aloft that once on Shiloh led;\r\n  Give justice to that rank and file, the living and the dead!\r\n  And when ye see that flag on high, remember how they fared\r\n  Who sprang to meet a cruel strife, surprised and unprepared:\r\n  O children, often when I see our standard quick unfurled,\r\n  Unconsciously my steps are braced to meet those volleys hurled!\r\n  Still burdened with the memories of sad and glorious fight,\r\n  The morning breaks among the tents, by the river falls the night.\r\n\r\n  Remember, 'twas the Sabbath day--the holy, blessed time\r\n  When neighbors crowd the roadside walks, and bells do sweetly chime--\r\n  Your fathers thronged the gates of death in Shiloh's bloody fray,\r\n  Beside the rolling Tennessee:--call that the soldier's day!\r\n  And oh, for our dear country pray, that all her laws be good,\r\n  That wrong no more shall lift a hand to claim the price of blood!\r\n  For heavy was the debt we paid, in noble blood and true,\r\n  When Slavery cast the gage of war between the gray and blue.\r\n\r\n  JOEL SMITH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHRISTMAS IN EGYPT._\r\n\r\n  \"Christmas comes but once a year,\r\n  And when it comes it brings good cheer.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOr it ought to. But when a Christian finds himself, on that most sacred\r\nof all the Christian holidays, in a Moslem country, say in Egypt, the\r\nprocuring of the wherewithal to make the prescribed good cheer becomes a\r\nmatter of no small difficulty.\r\n\r\nIf the Christian be an English one, the difficulties are apt to be\r\nincreased by the fact that an Englishman is nothing if not conservative.\r\n\r\nTo the average Englishman the correct celebration of Christmas means\r\nattendance at divine service, _perhaps!_--the regulation Christmas\r\ndinner, certainly.\r\n\r\nChristmas means a crisp, cold day, the home bright with glowing fires--a\r\nyule-log, maybe--and flashing with the brilliant green of ivy and the\r\ncrimson of holly-berries; a dinner of roast-beef and plum-pudding; and,\r\nto wind up with, a bowl of steaming wassail and a kiss under the\r\nmistletoe.\r\n\r\nWhen an Englishman finds himself in a country where he can sit in the\r\nopen air, under a blazing sun, on Christmas Day, and where neither\r\nroast-beef nor plum-pudding has any place in the domestic economy, and\r\nwhere the \"wassail\" is always drunk iced, and called by another name,\r\nand where mistletoe does not grow, the possibility presents itself that\r\nhe would be obliged to accommodate himself to the situation and do\r\nwithout these particular features.\r\n\r\nNot at all!\r\n\r\nHe immediately sets to work to obtain them, crying aloud, meantime,\r\nagainst the barbarity of a land that does not offer, at this particular\r\nseason, the things that are peculiar to his own tight little island.\r\n\r\nTo the casual observer this may seem a light task that he has set\r\nhimself. But it is by no means so. On every hand he is met by an almost\r\nimpenetrable wall of difficulties.\r\n\r\nThe fire he cannot have, for the very simple reason that there is no\r\nchimney in the house.\r\n\r\nThe beef he can get by sending for it to England, where it has been\r\npurchased from either Northern Europe or America. But where is the great\r\nfire before which it ought to be roasted, by the aid of a \"jack,\" and\r\nwith frequent bastings at the hands of a comfortable, rosy-cheeked,\r\nred-armed woman cook, in \"Merry England\"?\r\n\r\nHere, in Egypt, the only fire to be procured will be a tiny one of\r\ncharcoal, one of a dozen, but each separate, like the squares on a\r\nchess-board, and not much larger. And the cook will, in all likelihood,\r\nbe a wizened, yellow little man, smelling of \"arrack,\" and much given to\r\npeculation.\r\n\r\nHe may succeed in procuring his Christmas pudding, if he, early in\r\nNovember, orders the ingredients for it from England, through his\r\nEnglish grocer, and if the ladies of his household agree to compound it.\r\n\r\nThen the dreadful question presents itself, how is it to be cooked? A\r\nChristmas pudding of fair proportions needs to be boiled from four to\r\nsix hours, and during those hours it wants to be kept steadily and\r\ncontinuously boiling, or it becomes what the English cook calls \"sad.\"\r\nAnd so do its consumers.\r\n\r\nNow a charcoal fire is a good deal like Miss Juliet's description of\r\nlightning, \"it doth cease to be, ere one can say it lightens.\" And no\r\npower on earth less than a file of the Khedive's soldiers would keep an\r\nEgyptian cook in his kitchen, feeding a fire, four or five hours.\r\n\r\nAside from the fact that he hates and despises, as a good Mussulman\r\nshould, his Christian employer, and regards with horror and disgust the\r\npudding around which cluster the hopes of this Christian family, he has\r\na great number of little habits and customs that demand his frequent\r\nabsence from the scene of his distinguished labors.\r\n\r\nHe has a \"call\" to the little shed at the corner of the street where\r\n\"arrack\" is illicitly sold by a cyclopean Arab. No sooner is this\r\naccomplished, and he slinks back to his kitchen, furtively watching the\r\nwindows and wiping his treacherous mouth with the back of his dirty\r\nyellow hand, than he feels himself obliged to again rush out and indulge\r\nin a war of words with the old man who has brought the daily supply of\r\nwater to the household.\r\n\r\nThis is a very dirty old man, bare as to his legs and feet, and without\r\nany toes to speak of. He is clothed in a goat-skin, as is also the\r\nwater, for he carries that blessed commodity on his back, in a goat-skin\r\nthat is distended like an over-fed beast, with its legs \"foreshortened\"\r\nand all in the air, like a \"shipwrecked tea-table.\"\r\n\r\nThe greatly overtasked cook has scarcely had time to recover from this\r\nsally, when he feels himself called upon to again issue forth and attack\r\nthe donkey-boy, a small and inoffensive child who brings him vegetables,\r\nwhich the patient little donkey carries in two panniers slung over his\r\nback.\r\n\r\nAfter invoking upon the head of this child a string of polyglot curses,\r\none of which is that his progeny, to the sixth generation, maybe born\r\nwith their faces upside-down, he again retreats to his kitchen, gives\r\nthe pudding a vicious punch and the fire a morsel of charcoal.\r\n\r\nSoon he must go and squat in the sand at the back of the house, safe\r\nfrom all fear of observation, and play a game of dominoes with \"Nicolo,\"\r\nthe cook of the neighboring house.\r\n\r\nThen he must smoke two or three cigarettes, which he deftly rolls with\r\nhis dirty yellow fingers.\r\n\r\nIs it surprising that after these manifold exertions his exhausted\r\nnature demands repose? He stretches himself in the warm white sand, and,\r\nindifferent to the sun and oblivious of the fleas, he falls into a sweet\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nFor the pudding? Let us draw the mantle of silence over that heavy,\r\nstately ruin. When he wakes to find the ruin he has wrought, he will\r\nweep and wail and beat his breast, and call upon _Allah_ to witness that\r\nnever--not for an instant--has he left the kitchen.\r\n\r\nAnd in his heart he will secretly rejoice.\r\n\r\nThe Moslem servant always secretly rejoices in the annoyances and\r\ndiscomfitures of his Christian employer. If that Christian employer is\r\nmet by annoyance and discomfiture while attempting to keep up any custom\r\nassociated with his religion, or to celebrate any Christian holiday, the\r\nMoslem servant is especially and particularly pleased.\r\n\r\nAnd in this he obeys one of the laws of Mohammed, which forbids\r\nfriendship or good-feeling between Moslems and either Christians or\r\nJews.\r\n\r\nThe Moslems have a great number of holidays in their calendar, but these\r\nare nearly all fast-days.\r\n\r\nThe Arabs are a temperate, abstemious race, a race of light feeders;\r\nnaturally, they have a contempt for gluttony. In the matter of food, an\r\nEgyptian would feast luxuriously for a week on the amount that an\r\nAmerican or Englishman would consume at a single meal.\r\n\r\nThus the very abundance of the preparations which the Englishman makes\r\nfor his Christmas dinner repels good Mussulmen.\r\n\r\nThen, they do not celebrate the birthday of their own prophet; and the\r\ncelebration, in their own country, of the day which to us is invested\r\nwith so much love and reverence they consider an insult to them and to\r\ntheir faith, and they submit to it with an ill grace and in sullen\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nAll these things make a combination of opposing forces against which the\r\nEnglishman, endeavoring to enjoy his Christmas in Egypt, struggles in\r\nvain.\r\n\r\nSo he eats his roast-beef, which is braized, and his boiled\r\nplum-pudding, which is fried; takes his kiss--if he has any\r\nsense--without mistletoe; winds up an unsatisfactory day by drinking,\r\ninstead of the time-honored \"wassail,\" a jorum of champagne punch,\r\ncooled with artificial ice; and goes grumbling to bed, with the\r\nconviction that a Christmas in Egypt is a very \"brummagem\" sort of\r\nChristmas.\r\n\r\n  ROSE EYTINGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_STATISTICS OF IDLENESS._\r\n\r\n\r\nReliable statistics relative to the number of men out of employment and\r\nseeking work have always been difficult to obtain. In June, 1879, the\r\nMassachusetts Bureau of Statistics of Labor investigated the matter in\r\nthat State, reporting \"28,508 as the aggregate number of skilled and\r\nunskilled laborers, male and female, seeking and in want of work in\r\nMassachusetts.\" In November of the same year the number was reported as\r\nbeing 23,000. This was a little less than five per cent of the total\r\nnumber of skilled and unskilled laborers in the State at that time. Upon\r\nthat basis, says the report, \"there would be 460,000 unemployed\r\nable-bodied men and women in the United States, ordinarily having work,\r\nnow out of employment.\" On the basis of the June report, there would\r\nhave been 570,000 unemployed in the United States. This was the only\r\nstatistical report upon the subject made prior to 1885; and coming, as\r\nit does, from Colonel Carroll D. Wright, through the Massachusetts\r\nBureau of Labor, it possesses as much authority as statistical\r\nstatements ever do.\r\n\r\nWhile taking the census of Massachusetts for 1885, Colonel Wright\r\nthoroughly canvassed the subject of the unemployed in that State, the\r\nresult being published in the Report of the Bureau of Labor for 1887.\r\nThis report, though much delayed, is a remarkable one, not only for its\r\ncompleteness and the masterly analysis of the figures it contains, but\r\nalso for its minute divisions of the classes of unemployed; giving the\r\nage, sex, nativity, and trade of each person unemployed, and how many\r\nmonths in the year such enforced idleness is suffered.\r\n\r\nOut of a total of 816,470 persons employed in gainful occupations in\r\nMassachusetts in 1885, 241,589, or 29.59 per cent, were unemployed. The\r\nduration of the idleness varied greatly in different industries and\r\nlocalities, but the average loss of time was 4.11 months per year for\r\neach of the unemployed. Over 29 per cent of Massachusetts protected\r\nworkingmen idle for over four months of each year! The idleness of\r\n241,589 persons for 4.11 months is equivalent to 82.744 persons\r\nunemployed for an entire year. This is nearly 11 per cent of the entire\r\npopulation employed in gainful pursuits. Idleness, that is enforced\r\nidleness, increased 110 per cent in Massachusetts between 1879 and 1885;\r\nand this average time unemployed is net average, as the 10,758 persons,\r\nwhose loss of time at their \"principal occupation\" or trade was\r\npartially made up by securing \"other occupations\" and \"odd jobs,\" are\r\nseparately tabulated, and the amount of work at \"other occupations\" is\r\ndeducted from their loss of time at \"principal occupation,\" thus giving\r\na net average of the time wholly unoccupied at any sort of labor. It is\r\ninteresting to note the industries in which the greatest percentage of\r\nthis enforced idleness occurs. I take the following from an elaborate\r\ntable given in Mr. Wright's report. In the boot and shoe industry of\r\nMassachusetts, 48,105 male adults are supposed to be employed. Of these\r\n15,731 get steady work, while 32,374, or 67.3 per cent, are unemployed\r\nfour months in the year. The same industry employs 14,420 females, of\r\nwhom 10,250, or 71 per cent, are idle four months, an average of 2.62\r\nmonths idleness for all persons employed in that industry. The\r\ncotton-mill operatives number 58,383 of whom 26,642 are males, 31,741\r\nfemales. Of all these operatives, 24,250, or 41.5 per cent, are idle\r\nmore than one third of the time.\r\n\r\nIn the manufacturing of agricultural implements, a protected industry\r\nthat, being carried on in factories, needs not stop for weather, 69.1\r\nper cent of all persons employed are idle 4.12 months per year; whereas,\r\nof farm laborers, whose occupation is unprotected, and whose employment\r\nis wholly at the mercy of seasons, only 30.19 are idle during any part\r\nof the year, while 69.81 per cent find steady employment the year\r\naround.\r\n\r\nCarpenters, also, whose labor is unprotected and dependent largely upon\r\nseason, report 52.82 per cent steadily employed, with 47.18 per cent\r\nidle three months in the year.\r\n\r\nCompositors and printers number 4541 in the State, only 450, or 9.91 per\r\ncent, of whom are idle during any part of the year, while 90.09 per cent\r\nfind steady work. On the other hand, 51.31 per cent of the stove-makers\r\nare idle 4.09 months per year, and 66.4 per cent of rolling-mill\r\nemployés are idle 4.04 months. Stone-workers and brick-masons fare\r\nbetter, though unprotected, since but 46 per cent of these are idle\r\nduring any part of the year; while the tack-makers, taking both sexes,\r\nhave 70 per cent of idleness for one-third of the time, only 30 per cent\r\nfinding steady work. The silk industry employs 1975 persons--556 males\r\nand 1419 females; of these, 979, or 49.5 per cent, are idle nearly four\r\nmonths each year.\r\n\r\nThe woollen industries of Massachusetts employ 22,726 operatives of both\r\nsexes. Of these, 9463, or 42 per cent, are idle four months in the year.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the infinite beauty of protection is best illustrated by a\r\ncomparison of the work secured by blacksmiths with that of rolling-mill\r\nemployés. Of blacksmiths, 82.25 per cent had steady work for the entire\r\nyear, while only 17.75 per cent were idle 4.41 months. Of rolling-mill\r\nemployés, as stated above, 66.40 per cent were idle 4.04 months, and of\r\nnail-makers 73.49 per cent were idle 3.86 months.\r\n\r\nThe manufacturing industries of Massachusetts furnish 69.14 per cent of\r\nthe idleness of the State; i.e., of the 241,589 unemployed, 167,041\r\ndepend upon the manufacturers for work and sustenance. On the other\r\nhand, agriculture furnishes but 6.28 per cent, transportation 2.91 per\r\ncent, personal service but 1.72 per cent, and the day laborers but 8.43\r\nper cent.\r\n\r\nFall River, with a total laboring population of 26,220, found steady\r\nemployment for but 11,437, or 43.62 per cent, while 14,783, or 56.38 per\r\ncent of her population, were seeking work 3.49 months in the year. The\r\nresult of it all is that one third of the persons engaged in\r\nremunerative employment in Massachusetts were unemployed for more than\r\none third of the time.\r\n\r\nIt is significant that 129,272, or 53.51 per cent, of the total number\r\nof unemployed were found in twenty-three cities of the State, while 325\r\ntowns furnished 46.49 per cent.\r\n\r\nIt is often claimed that labor disturbances, strikes, and lock-outs are\r\nresponsible for most of the idleness in manufacturing industries. The\r\nreport under review goes into this question, and as a result ascertains\r\nthat in the manufacturing industries \"an average suspension of one-fifth\r\nof a month (0.20) was caused by repairs, improvements, etc. An average\r\nsuspension of one-fiftieth of a month (0.02) was caused by strikes and\r\nlock-outs,\" while the balance was due to \"slack trade.\" Just how much of\r\nthe loss of time was due to combinations and trusts \"restricting\r\nproduction, so as to control prices,\" does not appear; but when it is\r\nshown that in an average idleness of 4.11 months per year, strikes are\r\nresponsible for but an average of one fiftieth of one month, or but\r\nlittle over one-half day, it is time for \"statesmen\" to abandon their\r\nstock argument of \"strikes and strikers,\" and look about for some of the\r\nreal causes of present conditions.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to only partially supplement this investigation in\r\nMassachusetts by similar investigations in other States.\r\n\r\nIn 1886 the Illinois Bureau of Labor Statistics, in an investigation of\r\ntrade and labor organizations, covered the question of the number of\r\nweeks' work secured during the year. The following analysis of that\r\nreport refers only to the membership of labor organizations in the State\r\nwhich reported upon that question, or 85,392 workingmen. For these the\r\naverage was 37.1 weeks work and 14.9 weeks idleness during the year.\r\nOnly one-fifth found steady work for the year; about one-third could get\r\nwork but one-half the time; while, to quote from the report, \"the\r\nindustrial people, as a class, secure work for only 71.7 per cent of\r\nfull time, and spend 28.3 per cent of their time in idleness, for want\r\nof work to do.\" (Illinois Report for 1886, page 319.) The coal-miners of\r\nthe State secure work for but 23 weeks in the year. The occupations\r\nsecuring the greatest percentage of employment are those most removed\r\nfrom the protecting influences of that Congressional bill of fare called\r\ntariff. Thus the barbers, horseshoers, printers and pressmen,\r\nstreet-railway employés and railroad men, report nearly full time;\r\niron-moulders and rolling-mill men, 35 weeks per year; while other\r\nmetal-workers report 30 weeks of work and 20 weeks of want of work.\r\n\r\nIn commenting upon the tables given, Colonel John S. Lord, the able\r\nsecretary of the Bureau, says: \"Whatever value may be attached to the\r\nultimate percentage of time lost, as deduced from all classes, the\r\nspecific facts remain as to a great number of men and occupations. No\r\ninterpretation of these facts can obscure the important fact that out of\r\n85,329 workingmen, organized to promote their material interests, and\r\npresumably able to secure a greater share of them than the unorganized,\r\nonly about one-fifth of them can obtain continuous work for a full year\r\nof working time. As the last table shows, those who get less than 40\r\nweeks work are 65 per cent of the whole; and those who get only from 13\r\nto 30 weeks' wages in the year are 35 per cent of the whole, or 30,451\r\nin number.\" (Page 320.)\r\n\r\nAnother and not less important feature of the Illinois report is that it\r\nshows the number of members of labor organizations out of work at the\r\ntime of the investigation--June and July, 1886.\r\n\r\nThe question of the number of weeks' work secured during the year might\r\nbe sometimes loosely answered by the secretaries of labor unions; but as\r\nto the number at that time unemployed the answers would be almost as\r\naccurate as a census enumeration. The 634 labor organizations of\r\nIllinois had an enrolled membership in June, 1886, of 114,365. It was\r\nfound that 17 per cent of these belonged to both the Knights of Labor\r\nand to a trade union, and had hence been duplicated. Deducting these, it\r\nwas found that 103,843 persons were members of these bodies. Of these,\r\n88,223, or 85 per cent, were employed, while 15,620, or 15 per cent,\r\nwere idle. Applying this percentage to the entire number of persons\r\nengaged in the industries in which organizations were found, basing that\r\nnumber on the census of 1880, there must have been in the three grand\r\ndivisions of industry--manufacturing, mining, and transportation--at\r\nleast 50,000 men unemployed in Illinois in June, 1886. If that\r\npercentage could be applied to all occupations, this number would be\r\nswelled to 150,000. The Illinois Bureau found 15 per cent of all those\r\nengaged in manufacturing and mining industries idle in 1886.\r\n\r\nMassachusetts finds the equivalent of 11 per cent of all her industrial\r\npopulation idle during the year 1885, and finds 69 per cent of this\r\nidleness in protected manufacturing industries.\r\n\r\nSo far as I can see, the result of the Illinois investigation\r\nstrengthens and verifies that of Massachusetts, both resulting in the\r\nconclusion that for 1885 and 1886 the equivalent of at least 11 per cent\r\nof our industrial population was out of work. The Iowa Bureau of Labor\r\nStatistics in 1887 threw out the \"raw material\" of a report that would,\r\nif digested and tabulated, strengthen this position. Unfortunately, the\r\nreport as printed is but the reproduction of individual returns, and the\r\nwork of getting an average is too great for the time at command.\r\n\r\nA brief computation, however, on the figures presented shows that, in a\r\ntotal of 1989 reports to that Bureau from workingmen in all industries,\r\ntrades, and occupations, there was an average loss of time of 80 days\r\nper man per year; or, counting 300 working days per year, 26 per cent of\r\nthe time of the workingmen of Iowa is unemployed.\r\n\r\nAfter this survey of the field from the reports of three States, we turn\r\nto the report of the United States Bureau, at Washington, for 1885\r\n(pages 65 and 66).\r\n\r\nThat report, from information gained by its agents and other sources of\r\ninformation at its hand, estimates that 7-1/2 per cent of the 255,000\r\nmanufacturing establishments of the country were absolutely idle during\r\nthe year ending July 1, 1885, and that 168,750 factory hands were thus\r\nrendered idle. By applying the 7-1/2 per cent to all industries, that\r\nbureau stated that there \"might be\" 1,304,407 men out of employment that\r\nyear, but again readjusts its estimate as being too large, and gives the\r\nnumber as 998,839. That same year 11 per cent of all the people engaged\r\nin all gainful pursuits in Massachusetts were idle; the next year 15 per\r\ncent of all those engaged in the three principal industries aside from\r\nagriculture were idle in Illinois. In Iowa, 26 per cent of the time of\r\nworkingmen in all industries is spent in hunting work; and how, from\r\nthis state of facts, the Federal Bureau could get at a 7-1/2 per cent\r\nestimate it is difficult to see. Massachusetts finds 29 per cent of her\r\npeople idle one-third of the time, or 11 per cent all the time. If it is\r\nsaid that this percentage would be reduced in agricultural States, Iowa\r\nproves it to be not quite true, and at least the reduction would be\r\nslight. Allowing 4 per cent less of idleness for Western States than for\r\nMassachusetts is shown to be error by the reports of Illinois and Iowa.\r\nThe first estimate of the Federal Bureau, 1,304,407, was not too high,\r\nbut rather too low at that time. Applying the Massachusetts percentage\r\nto the entire country at that time, there must have been 1,913,130\r\npersons out of work; and it should be remembered, too, that this is\r\nusing as a base the number reported in the census of 1880, without\r\nallowing for the increase. Colonel Wright gives in his Massachusetts\r\nreport for 1885, 816,470 persons engaged in all industries; the census\r\nof 1880 gives that State 720,774, showing an increase of 95,696, or a\r\ngain of over 13 per cent. Applying the Massachusetts gain to the entire\r\nclass of productive industries, we find 19,753,071 as the number to\r\nwhich this percentage should be applied, instead of the Census number of\r\n17,392,099.\r\n\r\nI think no fair estimate of the number of unemployed in 1885 could be\r\nmuch under 1,900,000, and I believe no fair estimate of the present\r\nnumber of idle persons wishing employment and unable to find it, can be\r\nplaced lower than 1,500,000. At least 6,000,000 of persons ordinarily\r\nemployed are in enforced idleness from two to five months in the year,\r\nand thus forced to consume, while seeking work, the little it was\r\npossible to save during their six or eight months of employment.\r\n\r\nIt is not the purpose of this paper to consider the causes for this\r\ntremendous aggregate of enforced idleness. Doubtless much of it is due\r\nto the frantic attempts of combinations to control prices by limiting\r\nproduction. Protected by laws of Congress from competition with the\r\nindustries of other nations, under the guise of \"protection to American\r\nlabor,\" the combined steel industries of the country pay the Vulcan\r\nSteel Works of St. Louis $400,000 to stand idle, thus throwing its\r\nworkmen out of employ! The Waverly Stone Ring pays quarries thousands of\r\ndollars--in one instance, $4500 per year--to do nothing. The salt works\r\nalong the Kanawha were bought up by the American Salt Manufacturers'\r\nAssociation, and have never employed a man since. Thus is American labor\r\nprotected! The Standard Oil Company buys up competitors and dismantles\r\ntheir works. The tack manufacturers buy out a refractory fellow who\r\nwould not join the pool, and not a wheel has turned since. The Western\r\nLead and Shot Association buys the shot-tower at Dubuque, Iowa, to keep\r\nmen from working there. A leading politician and prominent officeholder\r\nof Illinois goes to Washington to prevent the tariff reduction on jute\r\nbagging proposed by the Mills bill, and pleads manfully for the poor\r\nAmerican workingman, though his own bagging mill has been idle for three\r\nyears, while he draws a dividend from the pool for \"limiting\r\nproduction,\" greater than he could realize by running his works. It doth\r\nnot yet appear that his idle workmen have shared in the profits he\r\nderives from their idleness.\r\n\r\nSloan and Company stop as many coal-mines as is necessary to prevent the\r\noutput from exceeding the limit agreed upon at the \"annual meeting\" of\r\nthe combination. So with the coke-ovens.\r\n\r\nThe Joliet Steel Mills suspended \"indefinitely\" upon the publication of\r\nCleveland's message to Congress, because \"we can just as well as not,\r\nand we wish to impress upon our workmen the necessity of maintaining the\r\ntariff.\" Very timid is capital, and very shy when it uses its power to\r\nstarve a thousand men into voting for its interest and against their\r\nown!\r\n\r\nThat very much of this idleness is caused by these attempts on the part\r\nof protected industries to limit the production of commodities at home,\r\nis probably true. That voluntary immigration into a country already\r\ncursed with a large idle population is the cause of much of it is\r\nprobably also true; but not to so great an extent as the imported\r\ncontract foreign labor. Voluntary immigrants usually come intending to\r\ngo far west and take up land. They come with intelligent purposes, and\r\nintelligently carry them out. The imported laborers are of a very\r\ndifferent type.\r\n\r\nA Pennsylvania newspaper states: \"There were six hundred and forty\r\nBulgarians just from Europe, by way of Castle Garden, marched to the\r\nmouth of a coal-shaft at Johnstown yesterday and halted at the entrance\r\nlike soldiers. On the opposite side of a close board fence six hundred\r\nand forty of the old miners marched out and were discharged. The new\r\nmen, great, burly, blank-faced fellows, then marched into the dark hole\r\nand took up the task laid down by the malcontents. We doubt if one of\r\nthe 'new arrivals' knew a word of English, or how much they were to\r\nreceive for their labor. What grand opportunities these animals will\r\nhave to study the beauties of our institutions!\"\r\n\r\nThere is in New York a company, with a capital of $50,000, chartered by\r\nthe State to furnish Italian and Hungarian laborers, in defiance of the\r\nlaws of Congress. That a committee has been appointed to \"investigate\"\r\nthis matter of the importation of foreign labor under contract would be\r\na healthful sign, had not these investigations become so diseased by\r\ncontamination with corporate influences that most of them end at the\r\n\"gate.\" The immigration for the first six months of 1888 exceeds that of\r\nany year since 1880, and it must follow that a vast percentage of this\r\nis either imported under contract, or, what amounts to the same thing,\r\ndeceived by the lying promises of the agents of those interested in\r\nflooding the American labor market. There is certainly no crying need\r\nfor additional laborers in this country, except to accomplish the\r\npurposes of a circular not long ago issued from a New York banking\r\nhouse, stating that \"to check the demands of labor for excessive wages,\r\nit is necessary to augment the tide of immigration to the United\r\nStates.\" The excessive demands of labor average $1.16 per day.\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, much that New York should charter a company to\r\nviolate the law of the land, when an Illinois legislature elects to the\r\nUnited States Senate a \"high-protective-tariff\" man who is building the\r\nState House of Texas with foreign contract laborers, brought there in\r\ndefiance of the law passed by the Senate to which he was elected. Just\r\nhow many of the four hundred thousand immigrants arriving annually are\r\nbrought here under contract, or lured by deceptive promises and\r\nadvertisements of those most interested in making laborers so plentiful\r\nthat labor shall be cheap, it is of course impossible to tell. But that\r\nthe fact is one of evil omen admits of no doubt. Rome drew nearer and\r\nnearer her end as the army of idle, hungry men increased. Feeding them\r\nfrom her public granaries may have postponed, it could not prevent, her\r\nfinal collapse. \"Enforced idleness, or the cheapening of men,\" says a\r\nwriter, \"is not the sign of decadence, it _is_ decadence.\" It is\r\nlaudable and praiseworthy to make money by just and legitimate means,\r\nbut it is damnable to _unmake_ men in order to make money. To study the\r\ncauses for this vast and constantly increasing army of unemployed, and\r\nthen _do something_ to check those causes and prevent their effects,\r\nwhile it might not be so good partisanship, would be much better\r\nstatesmanship than to \"fire the Northern heart\" by \"bloody shirt\"\r\nspeeches in the Senate, and the raking up of old letters to \"expose\" the\r\nviews some men held twenty-five years ago.\r\n\r\n  ETHELBERT STEWART.\r\n\r\nP. S.--Since writing the above, several hosiery works and woollen mills\r\nhave closed because of a \"tariff agitation\" which, if successful, will\r\ngive them cheaper raw material! \"No matter,\" says a leading hose\r\nmanufacturer in a Chicago paper, \"whether the result of the proposed\r\ntariff-tinkering will benefit or injure us ultimately, any sort of\r\nagitation of the question immediately blocks trade. People will not buy\r\nwhen there is the remotest hope that goods will be cheaper after a\r\nwhile. The manufacturing industries at this time cannot stand any tariff\r\nagitation.\" No sane person believes that there is a man, woman, or child\r\nin the United States going without stockings until they see whether the\r\nMills bill will pass the Senate! No sane man believes that one pair less\r\nof hose is sold in the United States because of tariff agitation. The\r\nunderlying fact is, that the protected industries propose to \"shut down\"\r\nand throw their employés out of work for the purpose of starving them\r\ninto voting for a continuation of the present iniquitous tariff\r\nschedules. It is the refined \"shot-gun electioneering system\" of the\r\nNorth.\r\n\r\n  E.

Every theory and supposition has curiously\r\nadded to the misapprehension. Rightly judged, with the plainest facts of\r\nhis life even casually considered, the Bird o' Freedom seems so\r\ndisreputable a fowl that one wonders how he ever came to be chosen as a\r\nfigure-head by Romans, Germans, Americans, or the Michigan Regiment that\r\nbore him alive as its standard through the smoke of a score of battles,\r\nand brought him home again unscathed to make a curious part of the\r\nhistory of a gallant State in the times that tried men's souls.\r\nInnumerable myths trail behind him as appendages to his unearned fame.\r\nHe was the Bird of Jove. He has ever been the reputed king of an\r\nethereal world of fancy. His eye alone may look upon the sun unwinking\r\nand undazed. And yet it is all in his eye, or rather in that of the\r\ncredulous mortals who believe the ancient story. There never lived a\r\npoet, sticking to his business, that has not at some time in his career\r\nbecome a panegyrist of his extraordinary supposed qualities and a\r\nproclaimer of his magnificence. It is a curious fact, too, that all the\r\nmoralists, save one, have at some time or other used him as a simile, a\r\ngreat example, a something to be imitated. That one, greatest of all, is\r\ncontent with the familiar and plebeian hen and chickens in one of the\r\nmost eloquent and touching of his monologues, and uses the miserable\r\nsparrow in that illustration which has in all time since given comfort\r\nto forsaken souls.\r\n\r\nWith the poetry about this overrated fowl everybody is more or less\r\nfamiliar. There is nothing finer; and it is somewhat startling, and also\r\ndestructive of our most cherished ideas, to say that it seems a case of\r\nmistaken identity almost from beginning to end. It cannot be the eagle,\r\n_our_ eagle, that is meant. He has never in a single instance done\r\nanything to entitle him to a medal. Yet the idealism of the ages has\r\nbeen heaping honors on his crested head through the necessity, as yet\r\nunexplained, of having some winged creature to glorify, to use as an\r\nemblem, to paint, to describe incorrectly if poetically, to embellish a\r\nheroic national moral with. It has been done without regard to fact in\r\nall the school-readers and other truthful volumes intended for the use\r\nof the very young. Every boy regards the American Eagle as the king of\r\nbirds even from a moral standpoint, and he is liable to at least a brief\r\nspell of disappointment if he has the faculty of observation and the\r\nlove of nature sufficiently developed to find out by-and-by that he has\r\nbeen deceived.\r\n\r\nThe coparcener with the eagle in all this beautiful nonsense is a bird\r\nthat never existed at all, and who, having at last fallen from her high\r\nestate, is now principally useful as a name for a hotel that has been\r\ntoo often burned, or as the escutcheon of an insurance company.\r\nConsidered in a matter-of-fact way, and in the cold and unflattering\r\nlight of natural history, our national emblem is no more a truth than\r\nthe Phoenix is, and is almost as preposterous as the roc. One wonders\r\nwhy, in the course of so many ages in which the gradual drift has been\r\ntoward common-sense and fact, men have not learned to turn for their\r\nanimal ideals, if it is necessary to have them, to the beasts and birds\r\nentitled to some consideration for actual qualities; for both beauty and\r\ngallantry, for instance, to the male of the barn yard fowl; for\r\ndevotion, to the grotesquely homely stork; for self-sacrifice, to any of\r\nthe beautiful creatures who flutter along before you in the path, with\r\nthe distressful pantomime of a broken wing and great distress, inviting\r\nyou to kill them easily with a stick or stone if you have the heart, and\r\noffering you every inducement to pursue them that is latent in man's\r\ncruel heart, but only after all to lead the marauder further and further\r\naway from a nest that is cherished.\r\n\r\nAs to the first of these hastily-given examples, any country-raised boy\r\nwill concede the point, and he has not been left entirely out in the\r\npoetry, and especially in the folk-lore, of the nations. He it was who\r\nmarked with his clarion the moment when he upon whose name is founded\r\nthe most powerful of the Christian Churches denied his master and his\r\nfaith. He sings the coming of the dawn in every clime, and marks the\r\nhour when graveyards cease to yawn, or when Romeos must depart. He leads\r\nhis harem abroad in the morning as he has ever done, ever ready to fight\r\nhis rival from across the fence or to meet in unconsidered duel the\r\nmarauding hawk. With a gallantry quite unknown to any other bird or\r\nhuman, he calls familiarly to others of his family to come and eat the\r\nchoicest morsel he may find. He is gay. He has the natural gait and air\r\nof an acknowledged chieftain. The sun glints upon his neck. His tail is\r\na waving plume the equal of which few birds can boast. He hath a bold\r\nand glittering eye. Sometimes retreating under the dictates of prudence,\r\nas many higher personages have often done and been commended therefor,\r\nhe is yet the ideal of homely, home-defending courage. Withal, he will\r\nupon necessity demean himself to scratch for a brood of chirping\r\norphans, and gather them to his gallant breast because they have no\r\nmother. Yet, forsooth, not this illustrious bird, but the eagle--the\r\n\"American\" Eagle--is the emblem of the foster-mother of all the nations.\r\n\r\nThere is a place where every visitor to Chicago may see this emblematic\r\nlordling near at hand. It is at Lincoln Park. There is a colossal cage\r\nthere where there are a dozen or so of him, and he is not even\r\nrestricted in certain limited flights which seem fully satisfying to him\r\nin his well-fed condition. If you go to see him there you will have the\r\nadvantage of observing how absurdly draggle tailed and slovenly he may\r\nbecome with full leisure to make his toilet if he ever does, and that he\r\nevidently is not naturally a dandy. This trait is not common with any of\r\nhis captive neighbors except the coyotes, and nobody who has known the\r\ncoyote in his native wilderness expects anything better of him. You can\r\nalso observe his grotesqueness when he is on the ground, where he often\r\ncomes, and there is probably nothing more ridiculously abortive in all\r\nnature than his movements when so situated. But one cannot visit him\r\noften or observe him long without becoming convinced that none of the\r\nattitudes in which he is almost invariably depicted on flags, medals,\r\nseals, coins, and other ornamental and emblematic devices is natural to\r\nhim. He never assumes them even by mistake or chance. \"The poised eagle\"\r\nbecomes poetry like all the rest, when you observe that his \"eagle\r\nglance\" has taken in a piece of fresh meat somewhere, and he wishes to\r\nkeep someone else from getting it. He then scrambles to the edge of a\r\nboard, or hitches along to the end of a branch of the dead tree where he\r\nsits, and drops off like a hen, making an awkward flight toward the\r\nmorsel that has attracted him. And when he gets there he edges\r\nsuspiciously around it in the evident fear that it may be alive and may\r\nbite him.\r\n\r\nYou will, however, be able to observe some of his traits that seem more\r\nnatural. There are the cruel eyes and the relentless expression; the\r\n\"hooked claws\" and the \"bending beak.\" It is an eye whose expression\r\nnever changes, and which regards with constant malice all its\r\nsurroundings. The brow, which gives it the look so much admired, seems,\r\naccording to Mr. Ruskin, to be merely a provision of nature to keep the\r\nsun from shining into it, thus disposing, Ruskin-like, at one fell swoop\r\nof one of the most striking of the poetical myths.\r\n\r\nStill others will be disposed of if you stay long. Did any one of my\r\nreaders ever read that neither the eagle nor the lion would eat anything\r\nthey had not themselves slain? Well, later advices seem to indicate that\r\nboth will upon occasion descend to carrion of the basest quality, and\r\nthat both consume considerable time in their native haunts in catching\r\nand devouring bugs. Lizards and such small fry are assiduously looked\r\nfor. Convincing proof of this, in the eagle's case, was not wanting in\r\none brief visit to the above-mentioned famous and beautiful resort. In\r\nthe same huge cage with the eagles were certain crocodiles, or\r\nalligators, or whatever name you may choose to call the Floridian\r\nsaurian by. To me they all seem very much alike. I suppose this is\r\nbecause I do not care much about supra-orbital bones, or the number of\r\nteeth or toes, or minute particulars of anatomical conformation, but am\r\ndisposed, after a blundering and non-technical fashion, to mostly regard\r\nlooks and actions. The adult, or semi-adult, alligators lie all the time\r\nasleep, never moving, never winking, never so much as apparently\r\nbreathing, and looking very much like chunks in a clearing. One wonders,\r\nin view of all the stories told, if they are really alive this fine\r\nsummer weather, when there is no excuse for hibernation, and if so, how\r\nthey ever manage to catch anything except possibly by lying with their\r\nmouth open and waiting until something mistakes the locality and crawls\r\ninto it by inadvertance.\r\n\r\nBut there is one little beast in this interesting family so young and\r\ninexperienced as to be only about nine inches long, including all there\r\nis belonging to him, largely tail. He is of a dark-green color, with a\r\nmottled-yellow belly, and a mouth, when he opens it, very red indeed. He\r\nhas no teeth large enough to be very frightful at a distance, and\r\nevidently depends upon the mere opening of this fiendish mouth to scare\r\naway all disturbers of the profound peace which broods perpetually over\r\nhim and all his family.\r\n\r\nThis small one had got away, and in a modified and unsatisfactory search\r\nfor his native bayou had crept through the meshes of the wire and into\r\nthe other apartment where the eagles were. He was down in the little\r\nrill of running water, and partially hidden under a stone. An eagle had\r\nespied him there, and was watching him, while I watched the eagle.\r\nPresently the natural instincts of the bird of Jove became too strong\r\nfor successful repression even in the presence of distinguished company,\r\nand he left his perch in the usual ungraceful way, and after alighting\r\non the ground waddled to where the little reptile was having a\r\ncomfortable time in his exile. He hesitated about the water, but finally\r\nwaded in and scratched the monster out from under his sheltering rock.\r\nHe then caught him round the middle with one gigantic claw which met\r\nentirely around his prey, and scrambled ashore. By this time the saurian\r\nwas fairly awake, and began to provide for his immediate future by\r\nopening his mouth. The eagle, looking between his legs, saw this and\r\ndropped him as an uncanny thing, and afterwards spent some ridiculous\r\nminutes dancing around his foe and warily dodging his satanic\r\nmanifestations of open mouth. The whole performance was such on the part\r\nof the eagle as would have disgraced in the eyes of her waiting family,\r\nan ordinary hen, and the end was that the alligator got safely back to\r\nhis puddle and his rock. He did it deliberately, and backwards, with his\r\nmouth open about one-third of his entire length. The bird was of average\r\nsize. He had the white feathers on his head which made him the \"bald\" or\r\n\"American\" eagle. Here was the emblem of this great republic vanquished\r\nby a sleepy little lizard less than a foot long. It was almost as\r\ndisgraceful a performance as the Mexican War of '46.\r\n\r\nI was once part proprietor of an eagle. He belonged to us, and we were a\r\ncompany of soldiers at a frontier post. While I knew him he lived in the\r\nmule-corral, and appeared to me to be at a great disadvantage there.\r\nSomebody had winged him against the face of the brown cliff at whose top\r\nhe had been hatched, and he was now accustomed to sit upon a rail in the\r\ncorner of the shed, and glare balefully at all intruders in the place he\r\nfancied he owned. He was perhaps fat beyond rule, but his claws were as\r\nlong and sharp, and his eye was as relentless, as though still obliged\r\nto follow his natural calling of catching the little New-Mexican\r\ncotton-tail, and swooping down upon horned toads.\r\n\r\nHis wings measured about five feet from tip to tip, though he was\r\nsupposed to have only lately passed the perilous period of his first\r\nmoulting, and to be quite young. He was fed with bloody morsels of beef,\r\nand had, when he chose to take it, the freedom of the whole enclosure.\r\nBut he was not on good terms with his neighbors, and maintained a very\r\ndignified demeanor toward some fifty mules, a dozen or so of cocks and\r\nhens, and an especially-privileged pig who had the run of the premises\r\nbecause it had been brought up by hand, and had, for a pig, remarkably\r\naristocratic ideas. He frowned upon all manner of fellow-creatures who\r\nby accident and unintentionally paid a visit to his majesty. Peg, who\r\nowned a house which she considered her own near his perch, this mansion\r\nbeing a deal-box turned down, was a special aversion. Peggy was a large\r\ndog, and was herself not a pattern of amiability, especially when she\r\nwas the mother of from nine to thirteen puppies, as frequently was the\r\ncase; and it was commonly remarked that Aquila was in danger of having\r\nhis head bitten off if he interfered with this interesting family, which\r\nhe seemed rather foolishly inclined to do. Yet this was not by any means\r\nwhat became of this Monarch of the Air finally.\r\n\r\nIf the eagle is one of the striking emblems of power, he is also upon\r\noccasion, as before remarked, a specimen of decided and almost pitiable\r\nimbecility. He cannot even walk. His utmost endeavors in that humble\r\ndirection seem to result only in an ungraceful waddle, in which his\r\nclaws interfere with his shins, and those of his right foot interfere\r\nwith those of his left, and he drags his tail in a most undignified\r\nmanner in the dust. Also, his long wing-tips refuse to stay folded in a\r\nproper manner, as each time he stumbles he is impelled to throw out a\r\nwing, reminding one of a boy walking across a brook on a log. This one\r\ncould fly only a little. The accident that had resulted in his captivity\r\nhe had recovered from, but the wing bone had not been properly set where\r\nit was broken, and the short flights he attempted were very one-sided.\r\nSo when he wished to go anywhere he usually walked, and it was such a\r\nwalk as above described, or worse.\r\n\r\nAnd when he did, it was to a place one would never have imagined that a\r\nproperly conducted and self-respecting eagle would have thought of. But\r\nthe bird seemed to have a liking for low resorts, and his special\r\nweakness was the pig-pen. This was, as it should have been, outside the\r\nwalls, and was generally occupied by some eight or a dozen little,\r\nsharp-nosed, pointed-eared, anti-Berkshire, Mexican pigs, whose business\r\nit was to eat up all that was left from the dinner of more than a\r\nhundred soldiers, and to be the heirs of all the condemned commissary\r\nstores, and whose fate it was to be finally eaten themselves, say about\r\nChristmas. The last lot that went in there is a distinct recollection to\r\nme, aside from their doings with the eagle. They came from some\r\naboriginal hamlet on the banks of the Rio Grande, about a hundred miles\r\naway. Each two of them had accommodations to themselves--a pen made of\r\nwillow sticks, tied together with raw-hide, and slung upon a donkey. The\r\nlong-suffering animal who had carried them so far had a round dozen for\r\nhis cargo. He was heaped and piled with pig-cages, and the topmost pair\r\nof little swine were having an airy ride at the apex of a pyramid about\r\neight feet from the ground, swaying from side to side with a sea-sick\r\nmotion as the donkey walked; and they looked sick. A more unpromising\r\nfamily was never reared even in New Mexico. Nevertheless they were\r\ndropped over the side of the pen after much chaffering with the owner,\r\nand at an expense of \"four bits\" each.\r\n\r\nAs soon as by some means he found out they were there, it was to the\r\npig-pen that this fatuous fowl resorted. I do not know why, but it was\r\nnot because he loved them, nor that he had especial business with them.\r\nMaking his way thither as best he could he would perch upon the side of\r\nthe pen and glare balefully down upon the occupants, who did not seem to\r\ngreatly care if he chose to amuse himself in that senseless manner. But\r\nafter a while he would drop down on the back of the nearest one, and\r\nholding fast with his claws, he would proceed to bite the back of his\r\nneck, tweak his ears, and otherwise maltreat him. But at his first\r\nsqueal the others would make common cause with him, after the unselfish\r\nfashion of pigs, and together they would pull our emblem down, drag him\r\ndown in the dust or mud as the case might be, and finally would hustle\r\nhim off into a corner, where he would sit scowling until some soldier\r\ncame and took him away. Whenever the shrill voice of a pig was heard\r\nexpostulating it would be understood that the eagle was at it again, and\r\nsomebody would go to the rescue of our national greatness. Often have I\r\nseen a couple of soldiers, each with the tip of a wing in his hand, and\r\nwith the eagle between them, marching him across the parade-ground to\r\nhis proper roost. On these occasions he looked exceedingly silly. When\r\nhis feet touched the ground he would attempt to walk, and with even less\r\nsuccess than usual. He reminded me of some urchin who had fallen into\r\nthe creek, and who was being led homeward in much wetness and\r\nhumiliation.\r\n\r\nIt is a sad story when the traditional dignity of the principal\r\ncharacter is considered, for he was finally killed by those pigs. The\r\nfacts developed at the inquest seemed to indicate that he had no\r\ndiscretion, and had gone too often. They had walked over him, and had\r\neven lain down upon him. Dead and disregarded he lay in a corner among\r\nthe litter, and they had not even attempted to eat him. This seemed to\r\nindicate that they had killed him merely as a lesson to him. There never\r\nwas more ignominious end to an exalted character.\r\n\r\nLiterature is very full of the reputed nobleness of certain birds and\r\nbeasts; their vaunted qualities of head and heart; the pride of their\r\nbearing; the independence of their lives; the solitary grandeur of their\r\ncharacters. And in the majority of cases these heathenish notions have\r\nremained undispelled by the lapse of time. Even men assume for long\r\nperiods of time the characters that romantic biographers have clothed\r\nthem with, and the youth of this country, now men, are only just\r\nbeginning to recover their senses after the singular yarns of such books\r\nas Abbott's Life of Napoleon, read in youth. As instances of the first\r\nstatement, the elephant is actually, and in his real circus life, an\r\nindocile and malicious beast, prone to blind rages, revenges, and sly\r\nmalice. The camel, darling of the Arab, ship of the desert, etc., has,\r\nby the testimony of those who know him well, less sense than a sheep; as\r\nlong-necked and homely a piece of perfect stupidity as there is in the\r\ncaravan, and looks it. I shall have attained the topmast round of a\r\nspecies of high treason when I mention a doubt as to whether that noble\r\nslave, the horse, is entitled to his general reputation, but such a\r\ndoubt I have. There are those who lose a good deal of money on him, and\r\nwill forgive him anything, even to the occasional breaking of their\r\nnecks. He has his admirers in a majority of mankind, yet there never\r\nactually lived that fabled creature, a \"safe\" horse.\r\n\r\nTo revert again, and finally, to our national emblem, his mode of life\r\ngives him, if we may fall into the vernacular, dead away. He may have\r\nhis virtues from our standpoint, and one of them is that he is not\r\nprolific. His crude nest is such a one as a boy might build in rough\r\nimitation of a nest, and call it an eagle's. Made of big sticks and\r\nnothing else, and added to as the years pass, it is wedged into the\r\nforks of a solitary hemlock, as high as possible from the ground and as\r\nremote as possible from any other thing, or is perched upon the shelf of\r\nthe cliff above the canyon or the coast. It contains only three or four\r\nhomely eggs. He seems faithful in his domestic relations, and pairs off\r\nnot for a season, but for life or good behavior. This one fact covers\r\nhis good qualities, for there is undoubtedly a spice of the heroic about\r\nit. With all his rapacious and predatory power of wing it may not be\r\ndoubted that he is a bug-eater and a lizard-catcher, and that on mesa or\r\nin valley he fights with the raven and the buzzard for the possession of\r\nthe uppermost eye of the casual dead mule. But his especial, weakness is\r\nan article of diet that he has no right to in the animal code, for the\r\nreason that he can't catch it. That is fish, and he invariably simply\r\nsteals it when he gets it. Any man who has witnessed this proceeding and\r\nnot been outraged by it could hardly be considered a competent juryman\r\nin a Chicago boodle case. The osprey, having caught his lawful fish by\r\npure skill and natural capacity, bears it away wriggling in his talons.\r\nHe is weighted by his booty and flies heavily. Somebody who has been\r\nsulkily watching him for perhaps a day or two from some unseen nook,\r\nsails after him and pounces upon him from above. Turning to fight he\r\nmust drop his fish, which the other gets and goes off with. One can but\r\nsee the disappointed fisherman return again to his watching, and think\r\nof a hungry brood of nestlings waiting at home, and feel some degree of\r\ndispleasure and regret in the fact that the marauder, unpunished and\r\nunregretful, is none other than the emblem and figure-head of the great\r\nrepublic. He knows that no nation can be considered strictly honest\r\nexcept his own, and he ever after is disposed to wonder at that\r\nignorance of the plainest facts of natural history that has led it to\r\nchoose out from the beasts and birds a thief and a coward for the only\r\nbit of heraldry its statutes know,\r\n\r\n  JAMES STEELE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE HOLY NIGHT._\r\n\r\n\r\n    It was so still a night--\r\n        So calm and still!\r\n  And watching stars, far in the silent sky,\r\n        Shone tenderly\r\n  Upon the quiet world asleep and chill,\r\n  And lying breathless in the frozen light.\r\n\r\n      O earth, unconscious earth!\r\n        Serene that hour\r\n  As the untroubled heart of the sweet maid\r\n        Who now hath laid\r\n  Her little Child to rest--her Child whose power\r\n  Hath bid e'en soulless things proclaim His birth.\r\n\r\n      Yet silent lies He now,\r\n        And asketh naught,\r\n  This sweetest One, but on His mother's breast\r\n        He findeth rest.\r\n  And of her tender smiling (sorrow-bought)\r\n  The still light falleth on His sleeping brow.\r\n\r\n      \"My Own!\" she whispers low,\r\n        And then her ear\r\n  Hath caught the angel anthem from above,\r\n        Where the Blest Dove\r\n  Forever broodeth, and she waits to hear\r\n  The song of peace re-echoed o'er the snow.\r\n\r\n      And yet the Babe doth sleep;\r\n        And does He dream\r\n  How, in the golden Christmases to come,\r\n        Through each fair house\r\n  That self-same song of peace, while tapers gleam,\r\n  Shall sound, as now it soundeth, strong and deep.\r\n\r\n      For happy childhood bears\r\n        Forevermore\r\n  His seal upon its brow, and childhood's voice\r\n        Shall e'er rejoice\r\n  At this glad time, when the Redeemer wore\r\n  Its poverty, its feebleness, and tears.\r\n      And every human heart\r\n        Shall tender grow\r\n  And very humble, if a child but speak,\r\n        That seemeth weak,\r\n  But still is strong in Him who would forego\r\n  Through strength of love all things that joy impart.\r\n\r\n      We praise Thee, O Thou King\r\n        Thou Holy One!\r\n  We praise Thee for our childhood, and we praise\r\n        Through all our days\r\n  This festival of peace and good-will shown\r\n  To man, while evermore the angels sing.\r\n\r\n  HELEN GRACE SMITH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_JOE:_\r\n\r\nA STORY OF FRONTIER LIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the early days when stage coaching formed a prominent feature of\r\nfrontier existence, \"The Pioneer Home\" was one of the most popular of\r\nthe Sierra stations. This was not due to its dimensions, nor to its\r\narchitectural advantages, nor to the accommodations it offered, for it\r\nwas nothing more than a roughly though substantially built,\r\ncomfortable-looking log-cabin. But standing as it did on the main street\r\nof Nevada City, it would have invited observation on account of its\r\nneatly kept, old-fashioned garden of hollyhocks, marigolds, and\r\ngilly-flowers, even if a swinging black sign-board had not designated it\r\nin glaring red letters as a place of \"Entertainment for Man and Beast.\"\r\n\r\nIt was Nathaniel Parkenson who, with the aid of his wife, rendered this\r\ndepot attractive both within and without. When news of the discovery of\r\ngold in California reached there, this enterprising couple were among\r\nthe first to venture from their home in Connecticut. Bent on seeking a\r\nfortune in the new El Dorado, they crossed the plains and joined an\r\nestablished mining camp. But their hardships were by no means terminated\r\nwhen their journey came to an end. Nathaniel found working the pick and\r\nshovel far more laborious than he had anticipated, and the privations\r\nand exposure of camp-life soon began to tell upon his health.\r\n\r\nAs for Mrs. Parkenson, able-bodied and capable of work though she was,\r\nshe soon determined in her mind that more congenial occupation and\r\nsurroundings would have to be sought. Many a plan suggested itself to\r\nher, but none formulated to her satisfaction until the coarse canvas\r\nbag in which her husband's earnings had been concealed and regularly\r\nadded to through many months began to evince a state of plethora. Then\r\nshe felt that the time had come when silence ceased to be golden.\r\n\r\n\"This kind of livin' ain't goin' to do for you, nor me nuther,\r\nNathanel,\" was the statement with which she one day interrupted a fit of\r\ncoughing on the part of her husband.\r\n\r\nToo much absorbed with the suggestion she was about to offer to observe\r\nhis surprise at the first expression of dissatisfaction he had heard\r\nfrom her lips, she continued: \"We've got to git out er this place in a\r\nlittle less nor no time, unless we wait till we're tuk out, and that's\r\nall there is about it.\" Mrs. Parkenson emphasized her remarks with\r\ndecided jerks of the head, which set in motion the half-dozen black,\r\npipe stem curls that hung on either cheek.\r\n\r\nNathaniel recognised this swaying of his wife's ringlets as a sign of\r\ndeep emotion, which only served to increase his surprise.\r\n\r\n\"But, Marthy, how's it to be managed?\" he inquired in a gentle,\r\ndeprecating tone. \"Surely yer wouldn't go back East to set the folks\r\nthere to makin' fun of us, would yer, arter what they said agin our\r\ncomin' so far away?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who spoke of East or West or any other p'ints of the cumpis, I should\r\nlike to know?\" asked Mrs. Parkenson, in a tone that indicated the\r\nuselessness of reply. \"Ef you think I'd be satisfied jest to settle down\r\nhere and cook for the fellers in this camp for the rest of my natural\r\nexistence, you don't know the stuff Martha Gummidge Parkenson is made\r\nof.\"\r\n\r\nNathaniel gazed at his wife with admiration and pride, while she laid\r\nbefore him, in her peculiarly convincing manner, the project that had\r\nlong occupied her thoughts. This was that he should obtain the agency\r\nfor a stage company; and, encouraged by the expression of his\r\ncountenance, she explained how she had already begun negotiations which\r\nit would be easy for him to complete.\r\n\r\nAnd this is how it came about that Nathaniel Parkenson purchased the\r\nestablishment in Nevada City which he called \"The Pioneer Home.\" It did\r\nnot take long for travellers to find out that here pies, biscuits,\r\ncorn-bread, and Indian pudding of a superior order were to be had; for\r\nMrs. Parkenson had profited by her New England training, and cooking was\r\nin her eyes a fine art not to be despised. Besides, she was ably\r\nassisted in her labors by Mary Jane, a niece who had joined the\r\nParkensons shortly after their removal to Nevada City. Mary Jane was a\r\ndark-haired, brown-eyed, well-grown Yankee girl, who delighted in\r\nstyling herself \"Aunt Marthy's right bower,\" which she did with an air\r\nof unmistakable appreciation of her own importance.\r\n\r\nThe dining-room was Mary Jane's special charge; and as the\r\nstage-drivers, accompanied by the passengers they had brought, filed in\r\nwith an expectant air (for they knew what good cheer was sure to await\r\nthem at this station), the girl received each with a friendly nod, some\r\ncheerful remark, or other token of kindly recognition. It is needless to\r\nstate that she had her favorites amongst those whom she knew best, for,\r\nbeing a woman and young, she had dreamed of her beau ideal in the\r\nopposite sex. Ample opportunity was at hand to study the male character\r\nin certain circumstances, and Mary Jane did not neglect it.\r\n\r\nThe bar-room was simply a part of the dining-room, a red calico curtain,\r\nalmost always drawn aside, forming the line of division between the two\r\napartments. Here the men employed in the stables, the drivers, and\r\nwhatever passengers waited over for the morning stages congregated to\r\npass the evening; and the smoking, drinking, and card-playing were\r\ninterspersed with many a thrilling, blood-curdling story of the road.\r\n\r\nMary Jane's ideas of propriety would not permit her to cross the curtain\r\nline at such times, but standing within its folds, partly concealed, she\r\nwould strain her ears to catch every detail of the narrative, oblivious\r\nof work or of Aunt Marthy's displeasure, until warned by Nathaniel to\r\n\"Git along, Mol, and do up yer chores.\"\r\n\r\nThus she first learned of Joe Marshall's exploits, and his bravery\r\nelicited her admiration.\r\n\r\nJoe drove the stage between Nevada City and Camptonville, a distance of\r\ntwenty miles, including a dangerous mountain-trail. Nobody knew anything\r\nabout his antecedents, but he was considered \"the whip\" of the hour, and\r\nhis daring feats were oftener recounted than those of any other mountain\r\nJehu. In short, his comrades regarded him as an honor to the\r\n\"profession.\" Mary Jane did more: she fell in love with him in spite of\r\nher aunt's frequently expressed disapproval.\r\n\r\n\"Girls always have a fancy for these good-lookin', rakish kind of\r\nfellers that don't care a fig for anybody,\" said Mrs. Parkenson; \"but,\r\ntake my word for it, Joe'll be slinkin' off one of these fine days and\r\nmakin' love to some other girl; then you'll just break your heart over\r\nhim,\" she added, with a violent shake of the curls in her niece's\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nMrs. Parkenson's warning was not prompted by dislike of Joe, but, with\r\nan eye to the main chance, she had set her heart on bringing Dick Bowles\r\ninto her family. Dick was the driver of the You Bet stage, and he had\r\nprospects in the shape of a wealthy uncle in the East who had promised\r\nto make him sole heir to his entire fortune.\r\n\r\n\"Dick ain't so very good-lookin', I'll allow,\" Mrs. Parkenson would add,\r\nby way of comparison; \"but he's more of a man than Joe, as anybody might\r\nsee with half an eye. Besides, he's clean gone on you, Mary Jane, and he\r\ndon't mind if the hull world knows it; but that Joe's indifference jest\r\nriles me all over. He's nuthin' but a beardless, pretty, good-natured,\r\nkind-hearted, careless boy--that's what he is,\" she added with a low\r\nchuckle, \"though he will persist in declarin' over and over agin that\r\nhe's turned twenty-five. Some folks may credit that, but I don't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Humph!\" exclaimed the girl, tossing her head and turning up her nose,\r\nwhile she thought: \"I'd like to know where auntie gits her men if Joe's\r\na boy.\" The angry color dyed her cheeks as she spoke in defence of her\r\nfavorite: \"I guess it's no fault of his if he ain't got a beard; just\r\ngive him time, and I'll bet a quarter he'll turn out as good a crop as\r\nany of the other fellers.\"\r\n\r\nMary Jane was perhaps the more indignant because she could not but\r\nacknowledge to herself the justice of Mrs. Parkenson's criticism. Joe\r\nwas, without doubt, undersized and boyish in stature; the most vivid\r\nimagination would fail to discover even embryotic promise of beard or\r\nmustache; and although his flowing chestnut locks might excite\r\nadmiration, they served to enhance his youthful appearance. These facts\r\nprovoked the girl excessively, particularly as ardor, which would have\r\ncompensated her for everything else, was decidedly lacking in Joe\r\nMarshall.\r\n\r\nJoe's peculiarities were not infrequently the subject of comment amongst\r\nthe men. \"It's not that ee's muskilar, but ee's wiry,\" was the criticism\r\nof Captain Cullen, the driver of the Malakoff stage. Cullen had been in\r\ncommand of a British brig before emigrating to America, and therefore\r\nretained his title, while he still struggled with his h's. \"Joe hain't\r\nafraid of nothink,\" he would declare, shaking his head and opening his\r\nround, dull eyes to their fullest extent; \"and dern me if 'is 'orses\r\ndon't seem to know it by the way they 'ammer hover the road. 'Tain't\r\nthat ee can outcuss the rest on us, for by Jove! I never 'eard a hoath\r\nhout of 'is lips. I've made hup my mind that it's sumthin' supernateral\r\nwot's got hinto 'im.\" Having thus delivered himself, Captain Cullen\r\nconsidered that point satisfactorily explained.\r\n\r\n\"I reckon you've about hit it,\" returned Dick Bowles. \"Joe's got his\r\ngood p'ints, to be sure, though he can't cuss wuth a damn. Mebbe it's\r\ncoz he don't drink whiskey; I dunno. That larf o' hisn gets me every\r\ntime; I never did hear anythin' to ekal it! Mebbe you've heard tell of\r\nthe circus man that cum along here last year and offered to give Joe\r\nfifty dollars a week ef he'd agree to travel about with his show jest to\r\nstart up the larf at the performances.\"\r\n\r\nThis was a fact. But the proprietor of the circus was not the only\r\nperson on whom Joe's laughter made an impression. When his full red lips\r\nparted in merriment, displaying his large, pearly teeth, and emitting a\r\nlow, gurgling sound, one was reminded of the rippling of water over\r\npebbles. Mrs. Parkenson declared that \"Joe's laugh was more contagious\r\nnor the measles.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Most everybody takes to Joe,\" said the landlord, by way of accounting\r\nfor Bowles's statement. \"For when he gits off that larf o' hisn, I'll be\r\nblowed ef it don't kinder draw folks towards him. But yer can't take no\r\nliberties with him, once he fixes them gray eyes on yer.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's too soft and sneaky for me,\" returned Bowles, testily. Then\r\nobserving the deprecatory glances of the others, he added: \"Ef I hadn't\r\ner seen him oncet when the Injins got arter him, the way he blazed away\r\nat the skinflints and then druv his team straight ahead 'thout even so\r\nmuch as losin' his color, I'd call him an out-an'-out milksop.\"\r\n\r\nKnowing glances were exchanged by some of the men, amongst whom it was\r\nno secret that Dick was decidedly jealous of Mary Jane's preference for\r\nJoe. Dick had reason to believe that if this formidable rival were\r\nremoved the girl would treat him better. For, cruel though she was at\r\ntimes, she accepted his attentions with unconcealed satisfaction when\r\nJoe was out of the way; it aggravated him, therefore, beyond measure to\r\nsee her sweetest smiles bestowed upon his rival.\r\n\r\n\"Guess you ain't feelin' O K,\" said Mary Jane one evening as she placed\r\na dish of smoking-hot bacon and eggs in front of Joe. \"Wot's up? bad\r\nnoos from the States?\" she added, with a mischievous twinkle in her eye.\r\nThis was banter, for nobody knew better than she that the young man\r\nnever received a communication of any sort through the mail.\r\n\r\nMrs. Parkenson had remarked upon this many a time, and in no\r\ncomplimentary terms. \"It must be a black sheep, and no mistake, that\r\nhome folks wouldn't send a letter to in all these years,\" she had said.\r\n\r\nJoe looked into Mary Jane's face, while a pained expression flitted\r\nacross his own; this was instantly followed by his peculiar laugh,\r\nthough it lacked the genuine ring and sounded forced and jerky. But it\r\nattracted the attention of two strangers who sat at the end of the long\r\ntable. They had arrived by one of the stages, and had registered in\r\nParkenson's big book as \"John Carter, M.D., and Edward Fulton,\r\nMinneapolis, Minn.\" Their business had been to examine a mine in the\r\ninterest of an Eastern company, and they were now on their return-trip.\r\nBoth seemed young, though the doctor's hair was sprinkled with gray at\r\nthe temples, and there were dark lines beneath his eyes which told of\r\nsorrow.\r\n\r\nThe doctor started perceptibly at the sound of Joe's voice, and dropping\r\nhis knife and fork, leaned forward with an attempt to obtain a view of\r\nhis features. This was frustrated by our hero, who had turned away, and\r\nin a low tone was answering his interlocutrice. The doctor looked\r\npuzzled, and continued his meal.\r\n\r\nPresently Joe left the table and passed into the bar-room. In silence he\r\nexamined the last leaf of the register. His face flushed, his hand\r\ntrembled; he was thankful that his agitation escaped observation. He\r\nlonged to get to his little room over the stable; but the only exit was\r\nthrough the apartment he had just left, and he hesitated. At the sound\r\nof approaching footsteps he moved towards the curtain, raised it, and\r\nmet Doctor Carter face to face. They exchanged glances; neither spoke,\r\nbut the doctor looked troubled, and with a deep frown riveted his gaze\r\non Joe's retreating form.\r\n\r\n\"Who is that youth?\" he asked, pointing toward the door through which\r\nJoe had disappeared.\r\n\r\n\"That's Marshall.\" answered the landlord. \"Everybody in these parts\r\nknows him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is he employed here?\" was the next query.\r\n\r\n\"He runs the Camptonville stage, and there ain't a better driver in the\r\nhull West.\"\r\n\r\n\"Strange!\" said the doctor, evidently not satisfied with the\r\nintelligence. \"Has he been here long?\" he added.\r\n\r\n\"It must be all of five years since Joe put in an appearance on this\r\nline,\" returned the landlord.\r\n\r\n\"Five years,\" repeated the doctor dreamily. He looked as though some\r\npainful reminiscence had been recalled to him.\r\n\r\n\"I'd like to know what you've found to interest you in that fellow,\"\r\nsaid Fulton, who now stood at his friend's elbow. \"You could scarcely\r\neat for watching him, and I failed to make you listen when I spoke to\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a resemblance to a person whom I once knew well--nothing\r\nmore--queer, is it not, with what persistency a familiar face will\r\nsometimes haunt us?\" returned the doctor, assuming an off-hand air.\r\n\r\n\"This fellow's double must surely have robbed you--for you looked ready\r\nto spring upon him just now when he went out,\" said Fulton, jocosely.\r\n\r\n\"Robbed me?\" repeated the doctor; \"ah, yes--he did, indeed--but you\r\nshall hear about it another time.\" And they seated themselves at the\r\ncard table.\r\n\r\nWhen Joe closed the door behind him, he moved slowly away. His eyes were\r\nfixed on the ground; he was absorbed in thought. Suddenly his attention\r\nwas arrested by Mary Jane, who awaited him, as she had frequently done,\r\nin the doorway of a rickety, long-disused barn. \"I say, Joe!--hist!\" she\r\nexclaimed, on seeing that he was about to pass without observing her.\r\n\"Look wot I've fetched yer;\" and she held up a couple of well-polished\r\napples.\r\n\r\nThe young man's melancholy smile troubled her, and although he pressed\r\nher hand in gratitude for the attention, she felt instinctively that she\r\nhad not occupied his thoughts.\r\n\r\n\"I say, Joe, what ails you?\" she asked, tenderly. \"Did I hurt your\r\nfeelin's when I asked ef you had noos from home? I thought you'd know it\r\nwas fun.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, no; you have never been unkind to me; you're a good girl. I'm not\r\nungrateful; you must never think that--but--\"\r\n\r\n\"But you're sick,\" she interrupted. \"I just knew there was somethin' out\r\ner kilter when you kum in, fur you looked so kinder wore out. I'll run\r\nand git you some brandy.\"\r\n\r\nHe held her back. \"No--no; stay--it's nothing; I'll be all right\r\nto-morrow--'all hunky,' as you say.\" He laughed to reassure her, and\r\nasked where she got the apples.\r\n\r\n\"Jake fotched 'em up from Frisco, and it isn't everybody I'd hook things\r\nfor, you'd better believe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wouldn't you do it for Dick?\" Joe asked, with a mischievous smile.\r\n\r\n\"None o' yer business,\" she returned, indignantly. It would have pleased\r\nher to notice even a suspicion of jealousy on Joe's part; but it seemed\r\nto her that the mention of his rival just at that moment was ill-timed,\r\nand she wondered why the fellow stupidly neglected his opportunities. He\r\nwas evidently touched, though, for he folded her in his arms, and spoke\r\naffectionately.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me, Mary Jane,\" he said, looking into her eyes, \"is it because you\r\nreally like me so much that you are so kind to me and put nice things in\r\nmy room? Did you think I couldn't guess who left the cake there\r\nyesterday?\"\r\n\r\nThe girl blushed with pleasure, and her eyes fell beneath his gaze. When\r\nshe raised them they were filled with tears, and her voice trembled when\r\nshe spoke:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Joe, if I didn't care so orful much for you I wouldn't be always\r\ngittin scolded about you; but--but--\" She was interrupted by her sobs.\r\nJoe stroked her hair lovingly, and she wept freely upon his shoulder.\r\n\"Ca-ant yer see I lo-ve you better nor Dick and all the rest o' the\r\nfellers put together?\" she asked, at last.\r\n\r\nHe kissed her again and again, then darted away and left her alone.\r\n\r\n\"Well, ef he isn't the queerest lot I ever _did_ see!\" said Mary Jane,\r\nafter convincing herself that he had really gone. \"He hugs a girl\r\ndifferent from any man I ever heerd of; Dick could give him pints on the\r\nsubject and no mistake.\"\r\n\r\nPrompted by coquetry and an earnest desire to arouse Joe's resentment,\r\nshe lavished attentions on Dick the next morning, much to this\r\nindividual's satisfaction. Her indignation was increased considerably at\r\nJoe's unmistakable indifference. Indeed, he took so little notice of her\r\nthat after hastily swallowing a cup of coffee and refusing the viands\r\nshe placed before him, he devoted himself to his horses, fondling them,\r\ncalling each by name, rubbing their limbs, and adjusting the various\r\nstraps and buckles about the harness, until the stable boys set up their\r\nshrill nasal cries:\r\n\r\n\"All aboard for You Bet! Here you are for Camptonville! This way for\r\nDownieville, Blue Tent, Forest City!\"\r\n\r\nAt the sound of a loud, piercing whistle every driver springs to the box\r\nof his respective stage, the passengers take their places, crack go the\r\nwhips, and the coaches are off.\r\n\r\nThey were scarcely out of sight before Fulton began to regret that he\r\nhad persuaded his friend to remain over for a day's rest, for the doctor\r\nwas evidently chafing at the delay, and he seemed unaccountably out of\r\nsorts. He wandered along the road, and evinced the greatest impatience\r\nevery time he consulted his watch. He questioned the landlord so\r\nclosely about the stage drivers that Fulton laughingly inquired whether\r\nhe proposed establishing an opposition company.\r\n\r\nThe day dragged its slow length along, and sunset brought the excitement\r\nand bustle that accompanied the return of the stages. They came in at\r\nintervals, each depositing its passengers, bundles, boxes, and\r\nmail-bags, then disappearing in the direction of the stable. It was soon\r\nobserved that the Camptonville coach, usually one of the first, had not\r\nreturned. Supper was served at the customary hour, and by eight o'clock\r\nthe men had assembled in the bar-room; still no Camptonville coach. The\r\nair was rife with conjecture.\r\n\r\n\"I say, Parkenson, wot's 'appened to 'er?\" asked Captain Cullen; \"she's\r\ngenally the fust in.\"\r\n\r\n\"I reckon we'll have to go out in search of her putty soon ef she don't\r\nappear,\" replied the landlord, who was showing unmistakable signs of\r\nuneasiness.\r\n\r\n\"'Taint likely the road agents has stopped her, is it?\" asked Bowles, in\r\nan awed tone.\r\n\r\n\"Wall, they'll find our Joe one too many for 'em ef they git arter him,\r\nfor there ain't a better fighter nor a truer shot in the hull country,\"\r\nreturned Parkenson, so ready to exalt Marshall's qualities that it\r\nrequired only a slight stretch of imagination to proclaim him a\r\npugilist. \"Wasn't I along with him oncet when the Injuns attacked him--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" interrupted the Captain, \"but Hinjuns is different from road\r\nhagents; yer hain't got no chance with a lot of fellers as jump hout\r\nfrom be'ind a tree with a rifle levelled at yer 'ead.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I tell you, I seen Joe,\" persisted the landlord, raising his voice\r\nwith a determination to be heard, \"when the derned redskins cum along\r\nwhooping and yelling like a lot o' devils let loose. Joe never stopped\r\nto ask how he could sarve 'em, but he jest blazed away at 'em, keeping\r\nthe mustangs straight along 'thout so much as lettin' a cuss or a sound\r\nout of his mouth.\"\r\n\r\nThis was one of Marshall's peculiarities. He was ostentatious in his\r\nsilence, seldom uttering a syllable while driving, unless it was to give\r\nvent to some scarcely audible command to his horses.\r\n\r\nThe words had hardly passed Parkenson's lips when the sound of wheels\r\nand the clatter of horses' hoofs were heard. Everybody hastened to the\r\ndoor; even the women were on the alert, and they had to crane their\r\nnecks to get a view over the heads of the men of the belated stage. Joe\r\nMarshall's seat on the box was filled by Tucker, a well known miner.\r\n\r\n\"Lend a hand, here, boys,\" he cried; \"Marshall's knocked up, inside\r\nthere.\" Quickly securing the reins he jumped to the ground, just as the\r\nstage door was thrown open. Another miner of the neighborhood sat in a\r\ncorner, tenderly supporting the unconscious form of poor Joe, and under\r\nhis direction a dozen willing hands were enlisted to convey the wounded\r\nyoung man to his room.\r\n\r\n\"You're a doctor, ain't yer?\" asked Mary Jane of Carter, wringing her\r\nhands in distress, while tears streamed down her cheeks. \"Then why don't\r\nyer take a holt and do somethin' for Joe?\"\r\n\r\nCarter's agitation was so great, however, that he was unable to offer\r\nsuggestions, and, for the moment, forgetting the requirements of his\r\nprofession, he simply moved along with the crowd.\r\n\r\nJoe's clothing was torn and stained with blood; so were the lifeless\r\nhands which lay where they had been placed across his breast; while his\r\nlong, brown hair fell back in a heavy, damp mass from his broad, pallid\r\nbrow, revealing an ugly cut. A stream of blood trickled from the wound,\r\nto which the doctor mechanically pressed his handkerchief from time to\r\ntime, while the others were lavish in their expressions of sympathy and\r\nregret. They laid the wounded driver gently on his cot, and then\r\nwithdrew and placed themselves in the doorway to await the doctor's\r\nverdict, while the landlady bustled about somewhat noisily in her\r\neagerness to procure the necessary restoratives.\r\n\r\n\"We must have more air and quiet,\" was the doctor's first remark, after\r\nhe had carefully examined the wounds and counted the pulse of the\r\ninjured man. No second hint was needed, and he and the landlady were\r\nleft alone with the patient.\r\n\r\nIn the bar-room, Tucker was giving the details of the accident. \"Joe\r\nmust er felt that he was in fur hard luck, fur I noticed that he wasn't\r\nlike hisself the minute I jined him. He looked so sour and seemed so low\r\nin his sperits that I asked wot was up. Then he seemed madder'n ever,\r\nand he druv so reckless that I was putty derned sure we wouldn't come\r\nout with whole hides. Sure enough, afore we knowed it, the animals shied\r\nat somethin' on the road and started to run. I got a holt onto the\r\nribbons, Harris, here, a helpin' all he could; but Joe jist let go, and\r\nlaid back until we came to a turn. Then away the poor fellow went flying\r\nover the rocks 's if he'd been shot from a cannon. As soon as we could\r\ngit the horses hauled in and quieted down, we went back to get Joe. We\r\nthought he was dead, but Harris got some water and throwed it on him\r\ntill he began to groan, then we fixed him in the stage and fotched him\r\nalong. That's the upshot of the hull business. It's dern'd lucky you had\r\na doctor handy, though he don't seem to be much 'count.\"\r\n\r\nAfter duly discussing the accident in all its bearings, the bar-room\r\noccupants disposed themselves as usual at the card tables.\r\n\r\nThe clock struck ten. At that moment Mary Jane, who having failed to\r\nobtain news through Joe's keyhole, had taken her stand at a window which\r\ncommanded a view of the stable, saw her aunt emerge. In an instant she\r\nwas at her heels, and the two women entered the bar-room together.\r\n\r\nMrs. Parkenson wore a mysterious air, and there was something about her\r\nthat attracted all eyes. It was easy to see that she brought important\r\ntidings. Her eyes glistened, her face was flushed, and she seemed\r\nbristling with information. Some of the men rose and gathered about her,\r\nasking questions.\r\n\r\n\"He isn't wuss, is he?\" said Mary Jane, with an injured air, adding: \"I\r\nreckon it wouldn't take a month to git it out, ef he wus.\" The girl\r\nthought she had been left out in the cold, and resented her dismissal\r\nfrom the patient's chamber.\r\n\r\nBut without according her the slightest possible attention, Mrs.\r\nParkenson addressed herself to the men. \"What do you all think?\" she\r\nasked, at last, without expecting or awaiting a reply. \"When the boys\r\nwere sent out of the room the doctor jest kept starin' at Joe, till I\r\nthought he was goin' to let the poor feller die 'thout doin' the fust\r\nthing for him; so I spoke up, and gave my opinion of the case. Then he\r\nroused himself, for he seemed most as much dazed as Joe was, and began\r\ndoin' things to bring the boy to. At last I ses, 'Let's put his feet in\r\nhot water;' and away I started for the bucket; well, it was a long time\r\nbefore I could git the water to bile, and when I went back to Joe's\r\nroom--of course I didn't stop to knock--what do you think I saw? You'll\r\nnever guess, not if you tried a hundred years. There sot the doctor on\r\nthe bed a huggin' and kissin' Joe, a-cryin' and callin' him his darlin',\r\nhis long-lost pet, his angel, and all such nonsense. I thought he was\r\ncrazy; the bucket fell out of my hand, and the bilin' water went\r\nstreaming over the floor. If Joe hadn't er spoke to me, I dunno what I\r\nwouldn't er done to that doctor. He wouldn't let Joe say much, but he\r\nturned to me and explained that Joe ain't a he at all; he's a\r\nsimon-pure, flesh-and-blood woman.\" She almost screamed the last words\r\nin her eagerness to make the climax effective.\r\n\r\nFor an instant the air was filled with ejaculations, so varied, so\r\noriginal, so potent, that Fulton, who was a stranger to the local\r\nphrases, was as much astonished at them as he could have been at the\r\nnews of Joe's sex. His head reeled as he turned from one to another.\r\n\r\n\"No woman could er druv them 'orses over sech roads,\" at last exclaimed\r\nCaptain Cullen, with a highly indignant air; \"you'll hexcuse me ef I\r\nrefuse to believe such 'umbug.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, ef Joe's a woman, who is she, anyhow?\" asked Dick Bowles, with a\r\ntriumphant glance at Mary Jane.\r\n\r\n\"It's a dirty, mean shame, that's wot it is,\" said that young woman,\r\nangry tears welling up to her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Joe's real name is Josephine Marsh,\" continued Mrs. Parkenson, anxious\r\nto keep the floor as long as possible, \"and ef you'll jest listen to me\r\na minute longer, I'll tell you the hull story. It seems that Joe's\r\nmother died in an insane asylum, and that is the cause of the hull\r\ntrouble. Joe was engaged to be married to this very doctor, who lives in\r\nthe town she cum from; well, one night she heard some of her folks\r\ntalkin' about crazy people, and all of 'em agreed that when there was\r\nthat sort er trouble in a family no marryin' ought to be allowed, and\r\nthey told the reason why. Joe loved her beau too much to run the risk of\r\nbringin' such a misfortune on him as they described it to be, and she\r\ncouldn't bear to stay right there and break with him, so she up and\r\nskipped. The poor thing sacrificed her hull happiness for what she\r\nthought right, and I don't care what any er you say, I respect her for\r\nit. I left the doctor explaining that her mother's case couldn't affect\r\nanybody but her own self; I don't quite understand how he made it out,\r\nbut Joe was satisfied; that I could see plain enough, for it brought the\r\ncolor back to her cheeks in a jiffy, and she jest looked as pretty as a\r\npicter. I don't see how any of us could ever have believed such a sweet\r\nlookin' creetur to be a man, or a boy either, for that matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"I ain't a bit surprised,\" calmly observed Mary Jane, with a curl of the\r\nlip, Then turning to Dick Bowles, who beamed with happiness, she added.\r\n\"I kinder thunk there was sumthin' peculiar about Joe all the time.\"\r\n\r\nWhat Dick's private opinion may have been did not appear, for he was\r\ncareful not to discuss the subject with his lady-love. It satisfied him\r\nto find that when he took her hand and pressed it tenderly, she allowed\r\nit to rest in his.\r\n\r\n  ROSALIE KAUFMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_EDITORIAL DEPARTMENT._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LATE ELECTION.\r\n\r\nThere are two lessons, taught by the late contention, that the people\r\nwill be slow to learn until coming events force them to a knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe first is, that our government has passed from the political fabric\r\nbuilt us by the fathers to a financial concern in which private\r\ninterests dominate public affairs.\r\n\r\nThe second is, that no public man, let his honesty and influence be what\r\nthey may, can menace the moneyed power of our land and remain in public\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nWe are so accustomed to being fed on phrases that we lose in their use\r\nthe object for which they were framed. Our fathers sought the shores of\r\nAmerica to escape oppression at home. The sum total of the despotism was\r\nfound in the fact that while they who produced all enjoyed nothing, they\r\nwho produced nothing enjoyed all. In framing certain legal enactments,\r\nin the shape of a constitution that was supposed to be good against such\r\ninequality and injustice, the fathers thought to eliminate privileged\r\nclasses by wiping out the laws of primogeniture and entail. They took no\r\naccount, for they could not know, of the corporation, that has all the\r\npowers and privileges of the born aristocracy, and renders all the\r\nguarantees of the constitution of no avail.\r\n\r\nUnder the power of the corporation we have a hundred and fifty thousand\r\nmiles of operating railway that has passed to the control and into the\r\nvirtual ownership of less than sixty families. To this combination has\r\ngone an attribute of sovereignty found in the power to tax the people.\r\nAs Senators Sherman, Conkling, and Windom said, in their famous report\r\nto the Senate, this railroad power can tax all the products of the\r\ncountry in a way Congress dare not attempt. This iron network of rails\r\nenters every man's business and pleasure, and is the taxation without\r\nrepresentation that brought on the Revolution and gave birth to our\r\ngovernment. The people lose through fraud all that they gained through\r\nviolence; and, sad to say, generally with their own consent.\r\n\r\nWe have the telegraph, so necessary to our business, which science gave\r\nas the poor man's post, for it consists of a wire, a pole, a battery,\r\nand a boy, that is openly owned and operated as a luxury by one man.\r\n\r\nThe currency, the life-blood of trade, is farmed out to something over\r\ntwo thousand corporations, that, acting as one, contract or expand it to\r\nsuit their own greed.\r\n\r\nWe are cursed with a system, called a tax, but which is in fact an\r\nextortion, that, under the plea of favoring certain moneyed interests,\r\nnot only forces the consumer to support the burthens of a government\r\nkept upon a war footing nearly a quarter of a century after the war\r\nclosed, but enables less than a million out of sixty millions to\r\naccumulate means until our rich men are marvels to mankind. The great\r\nRepublic, through this process, has entered the avenues of private\r\nenterprise, and with its crushing weight reduces labor to starvation\r\nwages.\r\n\r\nAll these combined form trusts, as they are called, which, limiting\r\nproduction, shut out competition, and accumulate for the favored few\r\nwhile the masses suffer.\r\n\r\nAll then, united, make our government; for government is that power from\r\nwhich there is no appeal, upon which we depend for a recognition of our\r\nrights. This power elects our Congress, selects our Presidents, and\r\nintimidates our courts.\r\n\r\nTo meet it we have a government of parties. It is a cast-iron,\r\nimmovable, insensitive concern, farther removed from popular control\r\nthan any government on earth. The party once in power can perpetuate\r\nthat power under the best of circumstances; but when backed by the\r\nmonopolized wealth of the continent it cannot be displaced. History\r\ntells us that it called for bayonets and bloodshed to displace the\r\nDemocratic party in '61, and we fear history will repeat itself when a\r\nlong-suffering and outraged people come to recognize the source of their\r\nwrongs and the cause of their sufferings.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, there is an ugly rock on which we once were nearly\r\nshipwrecked, upon which we are again driving. The sectional differences\r\nof '61 have been steadily cultivated for selfish partisan ends, and\r\nto-day the North is united, as far as a majority can unite, against a\r\nsolid South. While recognizing the fact that it is only through a\r\ncareful and jealous guardianship of the home governments found in the\r\nStates that this wide continent can be held under one control as a\r\nnation, we have the dominant party fatally bent on a centralization of\r\npower in the political structure at Washington. The negro is the\r\nChinaman of the South, and while Congress excludes through legal\r\nenactment the Mongolian from our midst, that same Congress presses the\r\nignorant, vicious African upon the South. This means not only a\r\nsubversion of political rights, but a social revolution that will make a\r\nSan Domingo and an Ireland of half our territorial limits. The South\r\ncannot submit to this and live. The South has given a bloody pledge to\r\nits intent in this direction, that it would be well for us to remember.\r\nThe North can welcome negroes to its firesides, may return them to\r\noffice because of their color, for this means votes, and nothing more.\r\nBut at the South it signifies a great deal more: it means the\r\nsubjugation of the white race politically and socially to the domination\r\nof the most degraded and ignorant class known to humanity.\r\n\r\nThis election has settled the fact that no public man can raise his hand\r\nor voice against the moneyed interests above enumerated and remain in\r\npublic life. Had President Cleveland been content with the mere routine\r\nof office; had he, in addition, used the offices under him as a reward\r\nfor personal services; he would have stood a good chance of re-election.\r\nHe is not of that sort; and when he sought to reduce taxation on the\r\npoor man's clothes and blankets he aroused the wrath of the great\r\nnational combine, and his fate was sealed.\r\n\r\nThere is not a man of average intellect in the whole length and breadth\r\nof the continent but knows that our elections are mere questions of\r\nmoney. From the first move of the Republican party to the last, there\r\nwas nothing but assessments and expenditures in this direction. Senator\r\nIngalls struck the key-note when he advised the selection as a candidate\r\nfor Vice-President of \"some fellow like Phelps, who could tap Wall\r\nStreet.\" Senator Plumb continued the cry when he called for a squeeze of\r\nthe fat manufacturers, the only class, he said, benefited by the tariff;\r\nand he added truthfully, that if he had his way he would put them on a\r\ngridiron and fry the fat out of them. This was unblushingly embodied in\r\na printed circular. Colonel Dudley followed, in his advice to State\r\ncommittees to schedule the floaters and buy them by the half-dozen,\r\nassuring the instructed that means would not be wanting to carry on the\r\ncorruption. What this corruption was, one word tells with more emphasis\r\nthan volumes. That word is Blaine. He nominated that figure-head\r\nHarrison, and planned and openly carried on the campaign of abomination\r\nto the end.\r\n\r\nIt would be a waste of space and ink for us to recapitulate the career\r\nand character of this man. The platform which he has built under himself\r\nand which has been accepted by his party is a pillory of public contempt\r\nand condemnation. Perhaps the eloquent Governor Stevenson, himself a\r\nRepublican, put it all in one sentence when he said of James G. Blaine,\r\nas presiding officer of the House, that \"more property passed under the\r\ngavel of the Speaker than was knocked down by all the auctioneers'\r\nhammers of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nWe waste much valuable indignation in denouncing individual wrongdoers\r\ninstead of attacking the system that makes such criminals possible. In\r\nno other civilized community on earth than ours would such a man as\r\nJames G. Blaine be tolerated for a day. The Ingallses, Plumbs, Dudleys,\r\nand that sort are leaders only under the great Republic.\r\n\r\nWe are defeated and well-nigh disheartened. We have to remember,\r\nhowever, that the war is on, and that it is a campaign and not a battle.\r\nWe must suffer many defeats, and we hope to enjoy many triumphs. Our\r\npeople are patient under abuse, but they are intelligent, and when once\r\naroused to a knowledge of not only their wrongs, but the source of such\r\nwrong-doing, are terrible in their wrath. The hour seems dark, but it\r\nmay be the hour before dawn. We remember the millions that in casting\r\ntheir votes were counted for free trade and all reform. Aided by the\r\nsuffering that comes of abuse we will yet win.\r\n\r\nIn all the gloom of disaster and defeat it is a comfort to know that our\r\nPresident stands higher in his loss of office than the incoming\r\nnonentity in his success. He leaves the Executive Mansion with the\r\nrespect of a people, and will go down to history as the one President\r\nwho dared offend his own party in the high discharge of his great\r\noffice. The intellect and honesty of the land follow him in admiration\r\nto his retirement. No cause is wholly lost that is supported by such a\r\nstatesman and such a following.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BALANCE OF TRADE.\r\n\r\nThere is no phrase in our political discussions so little understood and\r\nso generally employed as the above. Its use and abuse serve to\r\nillustrate the strange ignorance of political leaders and pretentious\r\njournalists. When a Senator at Washington, of the length and solemnity\r\nof the Hon. John Sherman, lifts a warning voice while calling attention\r\nto the \"balance of trade\" against us in our trade with the Canadas, we\r\nare enabled to measure the density of the fog-bank called the Senate,\r\nand why it is that fog-horns have taken the place of the persuasive\r\noratory that awoke musical echoes in the days of Webster.\r\n\r\nAs we reserve a corner of our magazine to the better instruction of\r\nSenators in political economy ($2.50 per year, invariably in advance:\r\nnow is the time to subscribe), we requested our accomplished friend John\r\nMcClung to put in brief a clear, concise, and correct definition of the\r\nphrase \"balance of trade.\" We begged our able contributor to treat the\r\nsubject as if he were preparing a lesson for the use of schools--say\r\nchildren of tender years--so that our Solons at the national capital\r\nmight comprehend without too great a strain upon their Senatorial\r\nbrains.\r\n\r\nHere is Mr. McClung's effort at instruction, and we commend it to our\r\nlaw-makers and the gentlemen of the journalistic pen as an easy lesson\r\non a subject that it is not of any great credit to comprehend, but\r\nutterly disgraceful to be ignorant of.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SO-CALLED \"BALANCE OF TRADE.\"\r\n\r\nThat it is good for a country to have its exports exceed its imports is\r\na notion that has been widely accepted among us. We have usually been in\r\nthat position, and the fact has been accepted as proof that we were\r\ndoing well under a policy of protection. England, on the other hand, has\r\nhad an excess of imports over exports, and England is free trade; the\r\nEnglish excess of imports has been accepted as proof of the mistaken\r\nnature of a free-trade policy.\r\n\r\nThe idea that it is a good thing to have the imports less than the\r\nexports, to have the balance of trade \"in your favor,\" as the phrase\r\ngoes, is a relic of that \"Mercantile Theory\" overturned by Adam Smith.\r\nThat theory was briefly, that wealth consists in the precious metals,\r\nand that for a country to remain wealthy, it is necessary to keep\r\nbullion from going out of the country. It followed from this principle\r\nthat everything should be done to discourage imports, for it was thought\r\nthat imports must, of course, be paid for by bullion. Modern political\r\nscience teaches that wealth does not consist in gold and silver, but\r\nthat these are commodities, like any other commodities, except that they\r\nhappen to possess a special fitness to be a medium of exchange. It\r\ndiscards the old notion that imports are paid for by specie, and\r\nasserts that they are paid for by commodities. It teaches that it is not\r\na bad thing to have the imports exceed the exports, that this excess is\r\nnot \"unfavorable,\" and that in fact there is no such thing as \"a balance\r\nof trade.\" The old \"Mercantile Theory,\" with its corollaries, has indeed\r\nlong been abandoned, but many people still consider it matter to\r\ncongratulate ourselves upon that our exports exceed our imports.\r\n\r\nIt is Bastiat who has given the most lively account of this subject. He\r\ncomplains in an amusing manner that the doctrine of the \"balance of\r\ntrade\" should exhibit such practical vitality, when it is admitted that\r\nit has so long been theoretically dead. He observes that the\r\nprotectionists are perfectly willing to leave him the victory in books,\r\nprovided always that their idea is paramount in practice. He finds but\r\none man, Lestiboudois, who has the courage of his convictions, and who\r\nsays that, because France imports 200,000,000 francs' worth of goods a\r\nyear more than she exports, she is that much in debt to foreign\r\ncountries. Others are not so candid; they accept the free-trade\r\nprinciple, but their conclusion is protection. Bastiat is not content\r\nwith obtaining the theoretical victory, but wishes to meet his opponent\r\nin the domain of business. He undertakes to prove from the books of his\r\nfriend, Mr. T. of Havre, that the idea of a \"balance of trade\" is wrong\r\nin practice, and to this end gives sketches of two of this gentleman's\r\nenterprises.\r\n\r\nIn one of these transactions Mr. T. despatches from Havre a vessel\r\nfreighted for the United States with French merchandise valued at\r\n200,000 francs. It was at this figure that Mr. T. entered his export in\r\nthe Havre custom-house. The cargo on its arrival in New Orleans had paid\r\nten per cent expenses, and was charged thirty per cent duties. Its value\r\nwas accordingly 280,000 francs. It was sold at 20 per cent profit on its\r\noriginal value; this, being 40,000 francs, brought the value of the\r\ncargo to 320,000 francs. This sum the assignee converted into cotton;\r\nthe cotton had to pay expense of transportation, insurance, commission,\r\netc., of 10 per cent. The return cargo, therefore, on arriving at Havre\r\nwas worth 352,000 francs. This cargo Mr. T. sold at a profit of 20 per\r\ncent and made 70,000 francs. The cotton was thus sold for 432,000\r\nfrancs. Bastiat offers to send the protectionist author an extract from\r\nMr. T.'s books in which he sets down as gained two sums: one of 40,000\r\nfrancs, the other of 70,000 francs. Bastiat adds that Mr. T. is\r\nperfectly convinced that he made this money. Mr. Lestiboudois, however,\r\nwould have found at the custom-house that France had an export of\r\n200,000 francs and imported 352,000 francs, and would have concluded\r\nthat she had squandered on foreign nations 152,000 francs.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time Mr. T. despatched another vessel, freighted also\r\nwith a cargo worth 200,000 francs. But this vessel went down and never\r\nreached New Orleans at all. Mr. Lestiboudois would find at the\r\ncustom-house that 200,000 francs' worth of goods had been exported, and\r\nthat there was no importation to balance this entry. France has\r\ntherefore in this transaction a clear profit of 200,000 francs.\r\n\r\nSo much for his friend T. Mr. T.'s case, Bastiat continues, is exactly\r\nthat of the French nation. If France imports more than she exports, she\r\ndoes not lose the excess any more than Mr. T. did. Bastiat invites his\r\nopponents to carry his theory to its farthest limits. Let it be supposed\r\nthat France only imports and does not export at all; in other words,\r\ngets everything for nothing: he still defies them to prove that France\r\nwould be the poorer.\r\n\r\nIt was that very able and convincing writer, Augustus Mongredien, who\r\nshowed, perhaps more clearly than anyone else, in his treatise on free\r\ntrade, that where a country imports more than she exports, it is\r\nimpossible that the excess should be paid in specie. Debts owed by one\r\ncountry to another can be paid to but a limited extent in specie. The\r\nFrench indemnity was paid largely in commodities. So have been paid the\r\ngreat sums of money which England has from time to time lent foreign\r\ncountries. The French indemnity was paid largely in bills of exchange.\r\nThe excess of imports over exports must be paid by commodities, for\r\nthere is no other way in which to pay it. This excess in England is\r\nyearly, we will say, £70,000,000. It is out of the question that such a\r\nsum can be paid in specie, for there is not the specie to be had. The\r\namount of specie in a country never exceeds to any considerable extent\r\nwhat is necessary for circulation. It is impossible that a country can\r\nretain an amount of specie much greater than that. The specie which\r\nremains after the demands of circulation have been satisfied lowers\r\ninterest and raises prices, and attracts merchandise from without; it\r\nthus very quickly finds its way abroad. On the other hand, when specie\r\nis sent abroad to such an extent as to trench upon the requirements of\r\ncirculation, this raises interest and lowers prices; the specie is thus\r\nquickly recalled. The action of the Bank of England familiarly\r\nillustrates this law. When it is wanted to attract gold, the rate of\r\ninterest is raised and the gold quickly appears; when there is too much\r\ngold, the interest falls and the gold quickly disappears. It takes only\r\na small sum, say £4,000,000, to produce this effect. How then is it\r\npossible that a yearly excess of £70,000,000 could be paid in specie?\r\nThe payment of such balances for two years would take out of the country\r\nnot only all the coin, but all the gold cups and silver pencil-cases and\r\nearrings it contains. It is computed that all the circulation, taken\r\ntogether with the articles of ornament and utility in Great Britain, the\r\nplate, watches, and trinkets, barely comes to £140,000,000. And yet at\r\nthe end of a long period, in which there has been a steady yearly excess\r\nof imports over exports, the country still has plenty of money.\r\n\r\nIf this excess is not paid for in specie, neither is it obtained on\r\ncredit. Merchants nowadays do not give and take the long credits that\r\nwere formerly the custom. There are certain imports, indeed, that are\r\npaid for before the goods come to hand. A cargo of wheat from\r\nCalifornia, for instance, takes from four to five months to reach\r\nEngland. But it is paid for by drafts on England at 60 days sight,\r\nwhich, sent forward by rail and steam, mature a month or more before\r\nthe arrival of the wheat in England. It is probable, indeed, that the\r\nwhole excess is paid for before it is received. The excess is certainly\r\nnot a debt owed by England; it is rather the payment of a debt owed to\r\nEngland. It is sent in payment of interest and dividends on English\r\nmoney invested abroad.\r\n\r\nMongredien shows that so far from its being an indication of debt when\r\nthe imports of a country exceed the exports, it is an indication of\r\nwealth. Such a condition is a matter for congratulation. But many people\r\nstill cling to the early notion. While all are agreed that foreign\r\ncommerce is a good thing, and while the world is unanimous in thinking\r\nthat it is well to have the exports as large as possible, many people\r\nstill cherish a dislike to large imports. It is forgotten that you must\r\nhave imports to pay for the exports, and that, if you limit the imports,\r\nyou of necessity limit the exports. The exports must be paid for by\r\nimporting commodities and not by importing specie. The case has been\r\nsupposed of a protectionist Paradise, in which goods only were exported\r\nand nothing but bullion received in return. Would a country be richer\r\nfor such a state of things? It would certainly not be richer, for there\r\nwould be an over supply of bullion, and it would fall in value in\r\ncomparison with other commodities. The workingman might receive twice\r\nhis former wages, but he would have to pay twice as much for everything\r\nhe consumed. Indeed, prices would rise much more rapidly than he could\r\ninduce his employers, by remonstrances and by strikes, to raise his\r\nwages. Bullion would thus become very cheap. It would be worth about\r\nhalf its price in foreign countries. The result would therefore be that\r\nthose holding it would send it abroad. But it would of course be sold\r\nfor goods, since the only other thing for which they could exchange it\r\nwould be bullion. The country would at once cease to receive nothing but\r\nbullion. There would be great exports of bullion and great imports of\r\ngoods. Protected interests would be ruined, and everything would be\r\nupside down, until the superfluous bullion would be worked off. Of\r\ncourse a country which imported nothing but bullion and exported nothing\r\nbut goods would be impossible, since no prohibitory measures can prevent\r\nthe transfer of specie from the country in which it was worth less to\r\nthat in which it is worth more. But the hypothesis may serve to show\r\nthat such a condition of things would be productive, not of good, but of\r\nharm.\r\n\r\nThe volume of \"Commerce and Navigation\" for 1877 shows that our total\r\nexports for that year were $703,022,923, while our total imports were\r\n$692,319,768. The countries to which we exported more than we received\r\nfrom them were England, Belgium, Holland, Spain, Peru, etc., while the\r\ncountries to which we exported less than we received from them were\r\nBrazil, Germany, France, Switzerland, Mexico, Cuba, Japan, Venezuela,\r\nRoumania, etc. It does not appear that the countries having the balance\r\nof trade \"in their favor\" as regards ourselves are more fortunately\r\nsituated than we. It will be seen that, regarding our whole foreign\r\ncommerce, the balance \"in our favor\" is something like $10,000,000.\r\nThese figures, it may be remarked, are by no means exhaustive and exact.\r\nThe freight is largely carried in British vessels, and this great sum\r\ngoes to England. Large sums are sent out from this country to Americans\r\nliving in Europe. These people, of whom there are many thousands, must\r\nlive, and they live upon money sent out from here. Then no account is\r\ntaken of the great quantities of stuff brought to this country by\r\ntravelling Americans. These are, of course, not put down among our\r\nimports. The returns of the United States and England are no doubt more\r\nexact than those of other countries. Before 1854 the value of the\r\nimports of England was given in the official valuation, supposed to\r\nrepresent the prices of different articles in 1699, but of course having\r\nno kind of relation to their recent value. From 1854 to 1871 the value\r\nof imports was estimated upon the average prices of goods as reported by\r\nthe brokers and the various Chambers of Commerce. Since 1871 it has been\r\nthe habit to trust completely to the values as given by the merchants\r\nthemselves. The exports from the beginning of the century have been\r\nreckoned upon the values entered by the exporters at the custom-house.\r\nThe returns of imports and exports are of course less trustworthy in\r\nother European countries than in England. It is far easier to smuggle\r\nacross a frontier than to smuggle in ships, and it is difficult for\r\ngovernments to watch the traffic of railways. It does not appear that\r\nthere is much to be learned from an examination of the custom-house\r\nreturns of Continental countries.\r\n\r\nOf course few persons could now be found to defend the ancient\r\nsuperstitions of the \"Mercantile Theory.\" But there yet remain among us\r\nmany who have a dislike to large imports, and who think an excess of\r\nexports a fortunate condition and one which furnishes evidence of the\r\nadvantage of a protective policy. The considerations set forth in this\r\npaper, which have been more elaborately represented in the writings of\r\nBastiat, Mongredien, and Leone Levi, show clearly that an excess of\r\nimports is not paid for in specie, but in goods; that it does not\r\nrepresent a debt owed by the country, but the payment of a debt to it;\r\nthat instead of being a bad condition, it is a good one, because it is\r\ngood both for individuals and for countries that debts owing to them\r\nshould be paid; and that in fact there is no such thing as the once\r\nfamous \"balance of trade.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA PLEA FOR THE PARENT.\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat strange that while our social structure trembles with\r\naffright at the bare mention of communism, one of the most popular\r\ninstitutions in our midst is as pure an instance of communism as ever\r\nhuman ingenuity devised. We refer to our common-school system. It was\r\ninvented not only to give the State control of the children, but so\r\narranged, the authors thought and its supporters teach, to force the\r\nrich through taxation to educate the children of the poor.\r\n\r\nTo put it in a more homely fashion, it is a process through which Jacob\r\nThomas, being with or without children, but viciously possessed of\r\nproperty, shall be made to educate the children of John Smith, who has\r\nvirtuously a large family of children, and is poor.\r\n\r\nIt is claimed that wealth owes this to the government for the protection\r\nwhich popular education gives to property: and so the government robs in\r\none direction to prevent robbery in another.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, two well-known truths that make this conclusion\r\nerroneous. The first is, that it is not property that pays taxes or,\r\nindeed, aught else, but labor. It is through labor that all values are\r\ndeveloped. The other truth, not so generally recognized, but yet a\r\ntruth, is that education does not make property more secure. On the\r\ncontrary, it adds to the insecurity complained of.\r\n\r\nInstead, then, of having the rich pay for the education of the poor, the\r\nwage-worker not only pays for the so-called education of his own\r\nchildren, but that of his more fortunate neighbor. This is so evident,\r\nwhen once seen, that it is not necessary for us to offer any argument in\r\nits support. Law-makers have, for a thousand years, been elaborating\r\nlaws through which capital in lands, tenements, and other forms of fixed\r\nvalues shall be made pay its share of the public burthen. They are no\r\nnearer the desired end than when they began. It is a vain attempt to\r\nreverse the pyramid and make the base stand on the apex.\r\n\r\nThe other error is not so patent. It comes of confounding intelligence\r\nwith the popular process of education. If the mass of men could, through\r\nany process, be made more intelligent, we are prepared to admit that\r\nthere would be a moral gain. The gain, however, would not be so positive\r\nor so great as many believe. Intelligence is not necessarily moral, nor\r\nis morality necessarily intelligent. The rules that govern moral conduct\r\nare few and simple, and, after all, it is more a matter of training and\r\nhabit, more the result of kindly feeling and religious belief, than any\r\nintellectual process based on an accumulation of facts.\r\n\r\nThis grows plainer as we look more carefully into this thing called\r\npopular education and realize its constituent parts. The true definition\r\nof education is, that exercise and development of the intellectual\r\nfaculties which teaches and trains the mind to think. This presupposes\r\nintellectual faculties. They are not general. The inequality, in this\r\nrespect, of the human family is well marked and universally recognized.\r\nThrough all the avocations of life, we find here and there at long\r\nintervals men so blessed in this respect that the masses look up to\r\nthem, select them to be teachers and leaders. It is the foundation of\r\nour hero-worship, and formulates the habits on which we live socially\r\nand politically.\r\n\r\nThe popular idea of the common school is not this. It is based on a\r\nproposition that the masses can be educated; that is, taught to think.\r\nThis conclusion is got at through a most ludicrous process. The mind is\r\nreduced to a memory. Facts are crowded into the pupil, and as the facts\r\naccumulate the education is supposed to proceed, and in possession of\r\nthese facts the graduate comes forth the superior of Plato, Bacon, or\r\nHerbert Spencer.\r\n\r\nThis is simply an idiotic exercise of the memory, and as the memory\r\ngrows perfect the intellectual faculties weaken and disappear. It is now\r\nrecognized by the more thoughtful that an abnormal memory is evidence of\r\nidiocy. The net result, then, of all the labor is to graduate a learned\r\nass.\r\n\r\nThe proof of what we assert is found in the result after the pedagogues\r\nhave completed their work. The millions are considered taught; the\r\nmasses take the level of unthinking multitudes, and look about among\r\nthemselves for their teachers and leaders. The schoolmasters have held\r\nall to a dead level; but once out in the world, and nature asserts her\r\nrights, and the truly educated, the strong minds that have taught\r\nthemselves to think, move to the front and take command.\r\n\r\nIf this thing were harmless, we could be content to let the popular\r\ncraze wear itself out. But it is not harmless. In our insane desire to\r\nhave this monstrous system prevail, let the cost be what it may, we lose\r\nsight of the grave fact that, while we cannot educate the people, we can\r\ntrain the people up to that moral condition so necessary to a safe and\r\nhealthy condition of a Christian community.\r\n\r\nIn our idiotic belief that in a cultivation of the memory we are\r\nelevating and purifying the mind, we make our schools not only godless\r\nbut positively immoral, for the untrained mind is trained in iniquity.\r\nAnd this pernicious result is strengthened by another crotchet of the\r\npopular mind--the habit we have fallen into of regarding the human race\r\nas a continuous whole instead of being the individual. We fail to\r\nrealize that when one is born the world begins, and when one dies the\r\nworld ends. We are like the notes of the piano: each key has its own\r\nseparate and distinct sound, and while they may be made to harmonize\r\nwith each other, the melody that melts through a flute or flows in\r\nendless eddies from a violin can never be reached. That government\r\napproaches human perfection which cares for the citizen and not the\r\nmajority; and that moral religious training given us by our Saviour is\r\nthe watchful care of the one soul. To this end the Church was organized:\r\nto this end was marriage instituted and made sacred. This means the\r\nhome--the only school, public or private, that has an unalloyed good in\r\nits composition.\r\n\r\nThe wrong being done our people cannot be overestimated. The child in\r\nbeing put to school has been expelled from home. The parent is taught\r\nthat the State has intervened and relieved God's responsible agent of\r\nall responsibility. This strikes a death-blow at the agency for good\r\nfound in the parent. We all recognize the fact that from the home comes\r\nall that is sound in the State. By the hearth-stone grow, not only moral\r\nimpulse, but true religion and all the patriotism that gives a love of\r\ncountry, and stability and power to the State. Anything, then, that saps\r\nthe foundations of the household takes from under us the solid earth.\r\nThis, we maintain, is what our common-school system as now organized\r\nand controlled is doing.\r\n\r\nWe trust our readers will be patient with us. We know that we are\r\ntouching on a tender subject. There is a religious feeling injected into\r\nthe craze that makes many men wild and unreasonable the moment the\r\nsystem is criticised. We appreciate and partake of the sentiment born in\r\nus through many generations of a struggle against the tyranny ever found\r\nin a union of Church and State. Our blessed Saviour saw this when He\r\nlaid down that line of demarcation between the two when he said: \"Render\r\nto Cæsar the things that are Cæsar's; and to God the things that are\r\nGod's.\" We not only say that we are opposed to governmental interference\r\nwith religion, but we go a step farther, and, to make the line between\r\nChurch and State yet more distinct, we assert that government has\r\nnothing to do with the morals of its people. Government is an expression\r\nof justice, as seen and felt in restraining through punishment the overt\r\nact of injustice. Morality and religion are so interwoven that they\r\ncannot well be separated, and the man who claims the political machine\r\nto be a great moral engine gives away all that our Christ commanded and\r\nour patriotic fathers sought to establish in framing our Constitution.\r\n\r\nWe hold that the morality of a people, like their religion, may be\r\nsafely left to the Church and the home. When, therefore, the socialistic\r\nbelief that the child belongs to the State and not to the parent\r\nprevails, not only the barriers but the very foundations of our social\r\nand political existence are broken down and in a fair way to be\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nWhen we assert that the State rests upon the home, we say that which all\r\nmen save communists heartily indorse. Now, the home is founded mainly on\r\nthe mother's love. It is the strongest feeling given to animated life.\r\nWe share it with the brute. It is the law of our being, and the source\r\nof all that is good. From the mother's care and training come our\r\nphysical and moral health. This is not sentiment, it is solid fact. It\r\nis not that poets have sung and sages taught this great truth, but there\r\nis not a reader of this who cannot trace back to his early home and his\r\nmother's love not only all that has held him or her to moral conduct,\r\nbut much that makes life worth living. This, that makes home what it is\r\nor should be, cannot be replaced by the State. The great infidel Robert\r\nIngersoll retains his hold on certain thoughtless classes, not by his\r\nwit, which is keen, nor his eloquence, which is unquestioned, but\r\nbecause he preaches a sort of religion of home, and claims to be the\r\nonly man, _par excellence_, who loves his wife and children.\r\n\r\nThe writer of this, when a judge, was remonstrated with for giving a\r\nchild to a mother whom he had divorced from her husband on the ground of\r\nher infidelity. He made reply that the wife might be a bad woman and yet\r\na good mother. Certainly there was no one to take her place. The court\r\ncould not give the custody of the child to a man who thought so little\r\nof its welfare as to come into court and ask for a decree of divorce.\r\nThe law had to be obeyed, and the divorce granted; but the custody of\r\nthe child was left to the discretion of the court, and the court\r\nconsidered it merciful to leave the child with the mother rather than\r\ngive it to a father who, in asking for a divorce, served notice that he\r\nwould marry again and give this unfortunate to the care of a stepmother,\r\nto torture it with the taint of its origin, and a conflict with the\r\nnatural affection for the newly found household and offspring.\r\n\r\nThe New England system of common schools recognizes the communistic\r\ntheory of right, in the State, to the child. It reduces this theory to\r\npractice by supplanting the parent by the pedagogue. It teaches that to\r\ninstruct the child is to make it moral, and its instruction means, as we\r\nhave said, an abnormal development of the memory. A belief in this has\r\ncome to be a popular fetish. The man who ventures to comment on it, or\r\noffers to amend or improve it, is hooted down as an enemy to his country\r\nand an infidel to its perfection. Pulpits resound with thanks to God for\r\nthe blessings of free education, the press is filled with praise, while\r\non the stump eloquent orators assure applauding crowds that our\r\ncommon-school system is the corner-stone of not only the great Republic,\r\nbut of our social existence.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, where are we? From all this senseless noise let us turn to the\r\nactual situation and consult the cold, naked facts. The increase of\r\ncrime and insanity in the United States within the last half-century is\r\nsomething appalling. They have not only kept pace with our much-vaunted\r\nprosperity, but have been, and are, forging ahead at a rate that fills\r\nall thoughtful minds with alarm.\r\n\r\nWe cannot extend our space and burthen our brief comment with the\r\nstatistics necessary to prove this fact, already patent to the more\r\nintelligent. Let the reader consult them for himself. He will find that\r\nthe increase of criminals and the increase of insanity, set forth in\r\ncold figures, are not to be disputed or misunderstood. But it does not\r\nfollow that these grave evils are to be laid to the communism of the New\r\nEngland common-school system. Perhaps not; but how much has this\r\nwonderful system done to arrest those evils? According to preachers,\r\npoets, editors, and stump orators, we are safe in leaving all to its\r\ncare and keeping. It has certainly accomplished little in behalf of the\r\nRepublic. Penitentiaries and asylums for the insane are increasing at a\r\nfearful rate; divorces follow fast upon the heels of marriage; and it\r\nmay safely be said that not a single trust-fund has been left untouched\r\nby the hand of fraud throughout the entire country.\r\n\r\nA further investigation, however, will lead us to yet another\r\nconclusion. The communism of the common school accompanies the evils. In\r\nthose parts of our country where it is most rigidly enforced crime and\r\nmadness have increased. In those sections yet new to the system these\r\nills are less; and as there must be a cause for the difference, is it\r\nnot safe to attribute it to this usurpation of the State, this insidious\r\nassault on the parent, and through both a weakening of religious faith\r\nand moral conduct?\r\n\r\nWe are well aware that, in the bigotry of belief that hedges about this\r\nsystem, there is no toleration for comment or criticism, and no room for\r\namendment. To add to this, immense sums of money are involved; for while\r\nthe State is keenly alive to the education of the people, and furnishes,\r\nwith the greatest liberality, school-houses and pedagogues, it is\r\nstrangely oblivious to the demand for books and stationery. In this\r\nsupply lies two-thirds of the vociferous praise and vindictive support\r\nof the system. As the late Colonel Sellers was wont to say, \"There's\r\nmillions in it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nABOUT THE BALLOT.\r\n\r\nWe have a growing number of earnest reformers who seek to better the\r\nmachinery of elections by throwing about the ballot-box certain\r\nprecautions, legally enacted, that will make the purchase of votes and\r\nthe intimidation of voters more difficult. The trouble, however, is not\r\nin the vote, but the voter. If the one is corrupt, there is no legal\r\nprocess known to law-makers that will purify the other. If a man holds\r\nhis vote in the light of property and knows of a purchaser possessed of\r\nmeans, it is extremely difficult to keep the parties apart or prevent\r\nthe sale.\r\n\r\nThis, however, does not apply to that well-known evil of undue influence\r\non the part of party leaders, or \"strikers,\" as they are called. Those\r\npartisans are reinforced by men who have others in their employ\r\ndependent on such employers for a living, and of course possessed of an\r\ninfluence calculated to control the vote of the dependent, whether such\r\nvoting is in accordance with the wishes or conscience of the voter or\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nWe know, for example, that in the late canvass every capitalist with his\r\ninvestment depending for its profit on the success of the Republicans\r\ntook pains to inform his workmen that unless Harrison were elected the\r\nworks could not continue, and they, the laborers, would be discharged\r\nand left to starve. He was animated in this only by the highest\r\nphilanthropic motives, not by any wish to influence the votes of his\r\nlaborers.\r\n\r\nNow, the operatives were intelligent enough to laugh at this, but they\r\nwere well aware of what he meant, and that was to inform them of his\r\nwishes; and as he had it in his power to know how each voted, it was as\r\nmuch as each man's place was worth to vote the Democratic ticket. That\r\nthere might be no mistake about this, the few who ventured to disobey\r\nthis champion boss were soon disposed of. It is scarcely necessary to\r\nsay that the smoke continued to pour up and out of the chimneys until an\r\nunfortunate wheat deal at Chicago sent the head centre of the attempted\r\ncorner to the penitentiary, and made this capitalist who thus sought to\r\nintimidate his laborers quite fit for the same locality.\r\n\r\nIf some process of voting, whether Australian or not, could be devised\r\nto end this \"bulldozing,\" as it is popularly called, it would be an\r\nexcellent reform. It would also go far towards weakening the blind\r\nadhesion to political organizations. Many men are held to this more by\r\nassociation and that lack of independence necessary to a severance of\r\nold ties. This denies the voter the right to scratch his ticket when he\r\nfinds a name on it that he knows to be that of a man he cannot approve\r\nand ought not to vote for. To keep abreast of his party he must vote\r\n\"the ticket, the whole ticket, and nothing but the ticket.\" The leaders\r\nand their lieutenants, as the machine stands, have it in their power to\r\nspot and expose anyone venturing to break over the line and obey his own\r\nwill.\r\n\r\nThis is the power, well recognized, which makes the nominating caucus\r\nthe government. The right to vote carries with it to each voter a right\r\nto a candidate of his own selection. As the matter stands, in fact, he\r\ncomes to the polls and has presented to him generally two tickets. It is\r\nclaimed that he can vote one or the other, or, as it is called, vote in\r\nthe air. The fact is he has no such choice. The despotic power of party\r\ndiscipline holds him firmly to the ticket his party has put in\r\nnomination. Our ballot, that is claimed to be secret, is open as the\r\nday. Every vote is counted and every voter known, and to make assurance\r\ndoubly sure the polls are guarded by both parties, and the noble citizen\r\nruns the gauntlet through double lines of detestable township or ward\r\npoliticians, potent for mischief in their sneers and jeers, and, if need\r\nbe, ready with dirty fists or clubs, sometimes revolvers, to back the\r\nedict of the party.\r\n\r\nThrough this process a majority is supposed to govern. The practical\r\nfact is that a small minority, and that made up of the worst element,\r\nholds sway. The nominating caucus is composed of men who work for pay,\r\nand put in nomination the political aspirants corrupt enough to purchase\r\ntheir positions. The more decent class of our citizens avoid the\r\nprimaries. They well know that to control them means a corrupt use of\r\nmoney, or a fight wherein victory is as fatal as defeat. In the rural\r\ndistricts the farmer is called to leave his plough and ride from one to\r\nthree miles, and lose a day's work, for the privilege of being\r\ncontrolled by a small political bunco-steerer to the support of some\r\naspirant to office who has the fellow in his pay. If the farmer differs\r\nfrom Mary's little lamb in not being white as snow, he resembles that\r\npoetic pet in his amiable docility. The caucus is composed of a mere\r\ncorporal's guard from the army of voters. In the towns and cities the\r\nelement is so brutal, impudent, and active that decency shrinks from a\r\nmere contact, let alone a contest in which decency will have its hat\r\nmashed over its eyes, its nose bloodied, and its body bruised. In ward\r\nand township these able manipulators are not the majority, as we have\r\nsaid, and yet they rule with a despotic brutality that makes the kingdom\r\nof Dahomey a liberal government in comparison.\r\n\r\nNow, as we have said, if some legalized process could be devised through\r\nwhich the ballot could be made safe and secret, a deadly blow would be\r\ngiven to the caucus. As it is, the managers buy a few and intimidate the\r\nmany. The basis of such reform, however, rests on the entire machine\r\nbeing paid for by the government. Tickets should be printed and\r\nfurnished free on the demand of any ten men claiming to be a party with\r\ncandidates to be voted for. Economy in this direction has costly\r\nresults. On the plea of legitimate expenditures large sums are\r\ncollected, and the people debauched. Any use of money other than that by\r\nthe government should not only work a forfeiture of office, but open the\r\npenitentiary to the voter.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, however, that to make this reform effectual it must be\r\nthorough and radical. The one great evil in our way is in our frequent\r\nelections. The insane effort to apply the ballot to every office has so\r\nmultiplied elections that it is impossible for a man to give attention\r\nto one-half, and follow his business so as to support his family. The\r\naverage citizen is forced to leave the filling of office to the\r\nprofessionals, vulgarly called \"bummers\" in town, and \"gutter-snipes\" in\r\nthe country. We have not only cheapened the suffrage and thereby\r\ncheapened office for the representative who represents, but we have\r\ndegraded the civil service until it is more of a disgrace than an honor\r\nto be an official.\r\n\r\nThat sort of reform which compromises with wrong is worse than none. To\r\nbe effective, reform must be radical. Chucking a boulder in a rut of a\r\nbad road makes the highway the more impassable. The rut itself must be\r\neliminated before repairs can be said to have a foundation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPASSING EVENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe political battle has been fought. We can look calmly over the field,\r\nestimate the causes that led to the result, and to some extent forecast\r\nthe future. The Republican party had no uncertain triumph. Since the day\r\nwhen Greeley was defeated by Grant there has been no such overwhelming\r\nmajority in the Electoral College for a Republican candidate. Even\r\nwithout the vote of New York General Harrison would have been elected.\r\nThe line of the \"solid South\" has been broken by West Virginia joining\r\nthe Republican column, and Delaware for the first time in her history\r\nelects a Republican legislature. Both Houses of Congress will\r\nundoubtedly be Republican, so that there can be no shifting of\r\nresponsibility for bad legislation. The defeat of the Democrats is\r\nclear, clean-cut, decisive.\r\n\r\nIt looks at first blush a temporary triumph for protection as against\r\nfree trade. There is no mistaking the fact that the country in a four\r\nmonths' campaign could not be educated to give up ideas which had been\r\nadvanced by leading statesmen of both parties for the past twenty years,\r\nand which met but very feeble protests from true Democrats. The\r\nprotection fetich has been shattered, but not overturned from its\r\nshrine. The result shows the folly of half-hearted campaigns. Even the\r\nvery authors of the Mills bill, filled with fearful tales of the New\r\nYork workingman's aversion to free trade, when they came to the\r\nmetropolis, instead of avowing that they proposed gradually to remove\r\nall restrictions upon our commerce with the world, began to apologize\r\nfor their position, and to protest that they were not engaged in a\r\nfree-trade campaign. Mr. Cleveland could not have been worse beaten had\r\nthe fight been openly made for the abolition of all duties whatsoever\r\nand the closing of every custom-house. But those who think with the New\r\nYork _Sun_ that we have had the last of an \"educational campaign\" very\r\nmuch deceive themselves. What could not be done in four months may be\r\nachieved in four years. The free-trade fight is on, and it is not at all\r\nimpossible that Grover Cleveland may yet be the standard-bearer in a\r\nvictorious campaign for human rights against combined monopolies. Other\r\nreasons for the Democratic defeat were: the greed of local halls for\r\npetty patronage, divisions among the Democrats of New York City over the\r\nmayoralty, jealousies of rival bosses in King's County, the free use of\r\nmoney by the Republicans, especially in Indiana, and the superior\r\nmanagement of the Republican leaders, who were at least honestly\r\nfighting for what they believed in.\r\n\r\nThe longest session Congress ever held closed on October 20th, having\r\nlasted 321 days. Its most interesting features were the tariff\r\ndiscussion and the unparalleled deadlock in the consideration of the\r\ndirect-tax bill. With the short session which begins on December 4th the\r\npresent Democratic ascendancy will come to an end, as the Republicans\r\nwill have a good working majority of at least thirteen in the\r\nFifty-first Congress.\r\n\r\nThe diplomatic world is laughing at Lord Sackville for his foolishness\r\nin falling into a Republican trap, and his summary dismissal by\r\nPresident Cleveland. In answer to an unknown correspondent in\r\nCalifornia, the English minister wrote expressing his views as to the\r\npending Presidential election--a thing in violation of all diplomatic\r\ncustom. The letter was published and used as a campaign document.\r\nPresident Cleveland at once demanded his recall, and Lord Salisbury not\r\nacting with sufficient promptness, the unlucky minister was given his\r\npassport on October 30th.\r\n\r\nEngland and Germany are contending for supremacy in East Africa, the\r\nlatter by bombarding the natives of Zanzibar into submission, and the\r\nformer by the peaceful methods of trade. Portugal is to join England and\r\nGermany in a naval blockade of Zanzibar to suppress slave-dealing, and\r\nthe Pope has sent $60,000 to Cardinal Lavigerie for the same purpose.\r\nThe Cardinal is raising a volunteer corps with which to fight the\r\nslave-dealers of Central Africa. The Congo Free State, the only absolute\r\nfree-trade country in all the world, is being rapidly opened. The first\r\nsection of the trans-African railway, from St. Paul de Loanda to Ambaca,\r\nhas been completed. Stanley has been heard from indirectly, but the news\r\nis eleven months old and his present position is unknown.\r\n\r\nRussia came near losing her ruler in a railway accident not far from\r\nTiflis on October 29th. As the Czar and Czarina were returning from the\r\nCaspian to the Black Sea, the train left the rails and was wrecked.\r\nTwenty-one persons were killed and thirty-seven injured, but the Czar\r\nescaped with a slight injury to his foot. Balkan questions still cloud\r\nthe political horizon. Austria is contemplating the occupation of\r\nServia, a step which would be followed immediately by Russia occupying\r\nBulgaria. King Milan has got his divorce from Queen Natalie. He pointed\r\nout to the Metropolitan of the Servian Church that the sovereign of\r\ncourse was superior to all law in such little matters as marriage-ties,\r\nand the Metropolitan obediently issued a decree granting the divorce.\r\nQueen Natalie has appealed to the Greek Patriarch at Constantinople.\r\nMeanwhile Roumania is trying an experiment in self-government, having\r\nintroduced a system of elections for members of a Chamber of Deputies,\r\nfor which all citizens paying taxes are electors.\r\n\r\nEmperor William has returned from his junketing tour. His reception by\r\nthe Italian people was enthusiastic, but his interview with the Pope was\r\nhardly a love-feast. Pope and Kaiser met face to face for the first time\r\nsince Henry IV. of Germany did penance at Canossa before Gregory\r\nHildebrand in 1077. A curious incident that happened just after the\r\nEmperor's visit was the breaking out of a fire in a wing of the\r\nQuirinal, in which the pontifical escutcheon affixed to the palace was\r\nburned. Another historical event occurred on October 17th, when Hamburg\r\njoined the German customs union, giving up its privileges as a free\r\nport. Bismarck's policy proved stronger than that of the free-traders in\r\nthe Reichstag, and German custom-houses now cast their shadows on the\r\nwaters of the Elbe.\r\n\r\nIn France the government proposals for a revision of the constitution\r\nseem to be in a fair way towards adoption. They include a fixed term for\r\nthe ministers and curtailment of the Senate's powers. The senators\r\noppose the plan, not caring to be \"revised\" out of their privileges. The\r\nHaytien republic has nearly finished its revolution. General Salomon,\r\nthe exiled president, died in Paris on October 19th, and General\r\nTélémaque was killed in an attack on Port au Prince. The only other\r\ncandidate for the presidency, General François Denys Légitime, was\r\nelected by the National Assembly on October 17th. The efforts of\r\nManitoba to reach a foreign market without being subjected to the odious\r\nmonopoly of the Canadian Pacific Railway may have serious consequences.\r\nThe Province is building a railway to connect with the American lines,\r\nand the Canadian Pacific refuses to let them cross their tracks. Both\r\nsides threaten to fight.\r\n\r\nBusiness is quiet but steady. Wall Street sharpers are anticipating a\r\nboom, as it is not expected that the new administration will do anything\r\nto hurt the monopolies. The shares of those trusts listed on the New\r\nYork Stock Exchange--American Cotton Oil trust and Chicago Gas\r\ntrust--have advanced in price. \"Old Hutch\" of Chicago is said to be\r\nengineering a corner in December wheat and January pork. Mr. John\r\nTaylor, of Chicago, who lost his fortune in \"Old Hutch's\" last corner,\r\nshot himself in a railway train while travelling from Paris to\r\nMarseilles, making the second suicidal crime attributable to this\r\ncommercial freebooter. The investigation of the will of Mrs. Stewart,\r\nwho was left a fortune of twenty-five million dollars by her husband,\r\nand died ten years afterward in debt over one million to her friend,\r\nex-Judge Hilton, who managed her estate, is developing a remarkable\r\nsystem of book-keeping. All her investments ceased to pay, and her\r\nadviser even charged interest for her husband's funeral expenses. The\r\ndirectors of the Richmond Terminal Company have obtained control of the\r\nGeorgia Central Railroad, with seven thousand miles of track and\r\n$9,000,000 gross earnings, and its ocean steamship line of ten steamers,\r\nplying between Savannah, Baltimore, New York, and Boston. Half the South\r\nis thus put under one gigantic railroad monopoly.\r\n\r\nLondon has been startled by another horrible murder in Whitechapel, the\r\nninth committed by an unknown assassin. All the victims have been\r\nunfortunate women of the streets, and all have been horribly butchered.\r\nThe criminal record is enlarged by the flight of City Treasurer Thomas\r\nAxworthy of Cleveland, Ohio, who was nearly a million dollars short in\r\nhis accounts, and whose defalcation temporarily bankrupted the city.\r\n\r\nAn accident which proves the value of water-tight compartments occurred\r\non November 10th near Sandy Hook. The _Umbria_ had just begun her voyage\r\nto Queenstown when she ran across the freight steamer _Iberia_ during a\r\nfog, cutting her in two. Both parts of the _Iberia_ floated away and\r\nkept above water for hours, allowing the rescue of all hands. Not so\r\nlucky was the Russian steamer _Archangel_, which collided with the\r\nGlasgow steamer _Neptune_ in Christiana Bay on October 19th, losing her\r\ncaptain and seventeen of the crew. Another steamer disaster was the\r\nburning of the _Ville de Calais_, owing to an explosion of petroleum gas\r\nwhile in port at Calais. Over a dozen lives were lost. As an excursion\r\ntrain was returning from the fêtes at Naples, a landslide occurred,\r\ncrushing the train, and killing ninety persons and wounding seventy. By\r\nan explosion in a mine at Frontenac, Kansas, one hundred and eighty\r\npersons were buried, not more than fifty of whom were taken out alive. A\r\nsimilar explosion occurred in the Campagnac coal-pit, Aveyron, France,\r\nin which eighty miners were killed. Yellow fever still lingers in\r\nFlorida. It has claimed 384 victims out of a total of 4,469 cases up to\r\nNovember 10th.\r\n\r\nThe theatrical season thus far is somewhat dull. Gilbert and Sullivan's\r\n\"Yeomen of the Guard\" was brought out at the New York Casino about a\r\nweek after its production in London, and met with no better success. The\r\nlively sparkle of \"Pinafore\" and \"Patience\" is missing. London has a new\r\nplayhouse, the Shaftesbury Theatre, opened on October 20th with \"As You\r\nLike It.\" New-Yorkers feel a pardonable pride in the success of the\r\n\"Giants\" in obtaining the League baseball championship. Starting third\r\nin the race, they obtained first place in the last week in July and held\r\nit until the end. Sporting men have been wondering at the remarkable\r\njump of Steve Brodie from the Poughkeepsie bridge into the Hudson River,\r\na distance of 212 feet. Mr. Richard K. Fox, by an offer of $500 and a\r\ngold medal, incited this foolhardy attempt, but the boy escaped with\r\nslight injuries. Two other Foxes, the famous sisters who forty years\r\nago founded spiritualism, have created a sensation by telling how they\r\nhumbugged people into believing what they now style a monstrous\r\nimposition. An attraction for lovers of art have been the paintings of\r\nVasili Verestchagin, the Russian artist, which are being exhibited in\r\nNew York. Critics pronounce them marvels of strength in delineation, but\r\na little too realistic for the most refined taste.\r\n\r\nFour well-known journalists have died during the month: Joseph M. Levy,\r\nproprietor of the London _Daily Telegraph_, who died on October 12th;\r\n\"Long\" John Wentworth, an old journalist, but best known in Chicago\r\npolitics, whose career closed on October 16th; Colonel R. M. Pulsifer,\r\nformer owner of the Boston _Herald_, who committed suicide on October\r\n19th; and Napoleon N. Thieblin, a New York financial writer, who died of\r\nconsumption on November 1st. The obituary record is also augmented by\r\nthe death at Tashkend of Colonel Nicholas Prejevalski, the famous\r\nRussian explorer, just as he was about to start on an exhibition to\r\nThibet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_REVIEWS._\r\n\r\n\r\n_History of Tennessee.--The Making of a State_, by James Phelan.\r\n(Houghton, Mifflin & Co.)--This book is to us a great delight. It\r\nillustrates so clearly what we have often said, that the success of an\r\nauthor is not so much in what he has to say as in the manner of saying\r\nit. This is an English rendition of the French axiom that style is\r\nthought. Anyone doubting this has only to remember that Shakespeare\r\ntranslated to any other language than his own is poor stuff. We laughed\r\nourselves into tears once over the play of \"Hamlet\" rendered into\r\nFrench. The melancholy Dane became a grotesque mountebank, and\r\nShakespeare's thoughts the dreariest sort of commonplace. It is the same\r\nof all.\r\n\r\nNow, we have had histories and histories. Those of the dull, plodding\r\nworkers in the worm-holes of time lift out the dust, and dust it remains\r\nuntil taken in hand by genius, and the dust is changed to gold. \"The\r\nrank is but the guinea's stamp\"--but the stamp makes it currency, and it\r\nis prized as it passes from hand to hand.\r\n\r\nWe have histories of States, we have histories of Tennessee--and they\r\nare too solemnly stupid, it is said, for consultation. The consultations\r\nare so rare that moth, mold, and mildew eat in and destroy them\r\nunmolested. We are erecting at an immense expense a huge building at\r\nWashington to hold the bound commonplaces of authors. How much better it\r\nwould be to have a commission of good fellows go through and consign to\r\nthe flames, or to the Young Men's Christian Association, or the\r\ncommon-school libraries, all the unreadable books! What a bonfire we\r\nshould have of histories alone! The dry theological husks of learning\r\nwould give Satan material for his furnaces for some days.\r\n\r\nTo return to our mutton--and it is tender, appetizing, digestible\r\nmutton. We have had histories of States and histories of Tennessee. They\r\nare all full of solid facts. Yet if a man can be found who will make\r\naffidavit that he has read any one of them with comfort to himself, we\r\nshall doubt his sanity or his truthfulness. Here is a young man, and a\r\nMember of Congress at that, who takes the same dry bones of fact, and\r\nthrough the magic touch of his pen, lo! the old skeletons take on flesh,\r\ndrink in life, and through the roseate atmosphere of romance the records\r\nare fascinating, and one closes the book with the feeling that pervades\r\nour being at the close of a grand opera well rendered, when in the\r\nsilence the feelings yet vibrate like the waves of the sea when the\r\nwinds that have vexed them are still.\r\n\r\nFor the first time we waken to the fact that the earlier settlers of\r\nTennessee were not common people. As a well-painted landscape is more\r\nprized than the real view, because of the art, so Mr. Phelan has given\r\nus a local coloring that makes these hardy pioneers picturesque and\r\npoetic. They make a charming background for such men as John Sevier,\r\nAndrew Jackson, James K. Polk, Daniel Boone, Sam Houston, and other\r\nnoted characters who toiled and wrought, killed and got killed, while\r\nthe State was forming.\r\n\r\nMr. Phelan tells us in his charming way of the struggles and hardships,\r\nthe wanton wrongs and wars, until the forests were felled, the swamps\r\ndrained, fields opened, highways and railroads built, and the wilderness\r\nchanged in less than three generations to farms and villages, where the\r\nbusy hum of human life took the hearing from the cry of wild beasts, the\r\nyell of Indians, and the sharp crack of the murderous rifles in the\r\nhands of robbers.\r\n\r\nOur space will not permit our giving much of this fascinating volume.\r\nThe author seeks to rescue John Sevier from an undeserved oblivion. At\r\nthe same time he relegates that historic myth Daniel Boone to his\r\ndeserved contempt as a land-shark and speculator. It is a great comfort\r\nto find a man of genius and a student withal going through these sham\r\ngods of the past, and puncturing their bran-stuffed bodies until they\r\ncollapse into insignificance. What a task some iconoclast of the future\r\nwill have among our war heroes of the late armed conflict! How the great\r\ngenerals whose fame, like kites, has been made of newspapers, will\r\ntumble from their pedestals, while the real heroes are lifted into\r\nplace!\r\n\r\nWe give space to give one extract not only as an example of our author's\r\nstyle, but for the facts he narrates. Speaking of the early Methodist\r\nChurch of Tennessee and its pioneer preachers, he says:\r\n\r\n     \"His manners were not polished, but they were far from rude. They\r\n     were simple and sincere, and were filled with a real sympathy and\r\n     warmed the hearts of his associates. He was plain of speech,\r\n     however, though if he wounded the vanity of his hearers he never\r\n     wounded their sensibilities. These were his chief limitations: he\r\n     was narrow, sectional, and bigoted, unpolished, beyond the grasp of\r\n     any but Christian fellowship, taking a hard, austere, and almost\r\n     terrible view of the world as it is, having real sympathy alone\r\n     with the world as it should be or as he would make it. Religion to\r\n     him was the goal of existence; all other interests were greater or\r\n     less temptations that drew away from the path of that goal.... It\r\n     is not a figure of speech to say that his path was beset with\r\n     death, and that for months at a time the penances of a Trappist\r\n     monastery were but as luxuries as compared to the daily trials of\r\n     hunger and thirst and sleeplessness which fell to his lot. He would\r\n     ride for days at a time, through any inclemency of weather, through\r\n     any degree of heat or cold, to keep an appointment to preach the\r\n     Word to those who hungered for the Lord. The last rain perhaps had\r\n     swept a bridge away. A tribe of hostile Indians were prowling\r\n     through the forests which he would have to penetrate. A heavy fall\r\n     of snow had obscured the trail that led through the intricacies of\r\n     a swamp. It was doubtful if he could procure food for man or beast\r\n     for days, and it was vain to try to carry a sufficient supply. It\r\n     was impossible to procure a guide across 'the forks' of some range\r\n     of hills, thickly covered with ravines and with dangerous defiles.\r\n     Starvation and all the forms of death lay thick around and before\r\n     him. The stoutest heart might have quailed, the most unflinching\r\n     sense of duty might have wavered. The rational mind might have\r\n     justly demanded a greater degree of equality between the magnitude\r\n     of the thing to be accomplished and the difficulties and dangers\r\n     attending its accomplishment. All these things gave him not a\r\n     moment's pause. Herein was manifest the grandeur of the circuit\r\n     rider's character. His mind was not the mind of a rational man, as\r\n     we estimate rationality. His profession of faith and his wish for\r\n     salvation were sincere to the full extent of their importance as he\r\n     estimated it. Religion was a real and a tangible thing to him. The\r\n     simple, unhesitating sincerity of his faith was grand, it was\r\n     wonderful, it was sublime.... He merged the individual completely\r\n     in the work, he lost all sense of personal interest in the craving\r\n     to advance the interests of others. He was willing to meet death\r\n     for the attainment of the smallest of the tasks set before him. He\r\n     was willing to forego all personal comfort as a part of the daily\r\n     life of which hunger and thirst were the incidents. Luxury he had\r\n     never known or seen.... As the Church increased in numbers and\r\n     influence, the pioneer of religion, the one who had hewn for it a\r\n     way through the primeval forests, either pushed forward with the\r\n     advance line of civilization or yielded to the mellowing influence\r\n     of a more genial state of society. As villages developed into towns\r\n     with souls enough to repay an exclusive charge, the saddle-bags and\r\n     the saddle were exchanged for a settled habitation. Sometimes he\r\n     married, and from the first, marriage had practically destroyed his\r\n     usefulness as an itinerant. He is now familiar to us only in\r\n     tradition. The discipline of Conference assignments of duty, which\r\n     carry with them change of habitation, still suggests his noble\r\n     activity in the early days of Tennessee history.\"\r\n\r\nAnd yet, remembering the self-devotion, the sacrifices, the fervor and\r\nforce of this religious enthusiasm, how little trace was left. The\r\nreligion of Tennessee to-day is farther removed from the teachings of\r\nthose early martyrs to what they believed the cause of God than were\r\nthe Indians they cared little for, or the rough settlers they sought so\r\nfervently to convert. There is no trace of Indian or settler, nor the\r\nremotest vestige of the religion these preachers so earnestly taught.\r\nThis because it was the religion of dogmas, founded upon the vengeance\r\nof God as they saw it in the chronicles of the Hebrews. They carried\r\nwhat Burns called \"tyding o' damnation;\" and the long-haired,\r\nhollow-eyed, hot gospeller gave vivid descriptions of unending torture\r\nof hell to the unbeliever. The love of God, the tender mercy of our\r\nblessed Redeemer, were lost in the awful vengeance of an offended and\r\nunforgiving Deity.\r\n\r\nPoor human nature, as found among those earlier settlers, was\r\nfrightened. The historian tells us that these attacks, more on the\r\nnerves than the conscience, culminated at revivals in what was called\r\nthe \"jerks.\" He says: \"They were involuntary and irresistible. When\r\nunder their influence the sufferers would dance, or sing, or shout.\r\nSometimes they would sway from side to side, or throw the head backward\r\nor forward, or leap, or spring. Generally those under the influence\r\nwould, at the end, fall upon the ground and remain rigid for hours, and\r\nsometimes whole multitudes would become dumb and fall prostrate. As the\r\nswoon passed away, the sufferer would weep piteously, moan and sob.\r\nAfter a while the gloom would lift, a smile of heavenly peace would\r\nirradiate the countenance, words of joy and rapture would break forth,\r\nand conversion always followed.\"\r\n\r\nIt came, in time, to be observed that this conversion affected only the\r\nconverted member's manner. To be very serious and sad, to have profanity\r\ngive place to prayers, made the substance of the process through which\r\none escaped eternal punishment after death. Faith that is simply a\r\nlonging for life was confounded with belief that, having its base in\r\nevidence, is entirely beyond the control of the would-be believer. The\r\nwhole theological affair touched the moral conduct of the true believer\r\nonly slightly. Life was harder in the Church than out of it. Charity,\r\nthe love of one's neighbor, the forgiveness of sins on the part of the\r\nmember--how could he forgive when his God would not forgive?--all gave\r\nway to a loud assertion of total depravity in the convert, and a\r\nprofound belief in the dogmas. It was not long before these settlers\r\nobserved that in dealing with a class-leader they had to be more\r\ncautious and guarded against being cheated than in like transactions\r\nwith the godless.\r\n\r\nHowever, those simple souls upon the border did not differ much from our\r\nhumanity of to-day. Poor human nature is prone to love in the form\r\nitself the object for which the form was created. The white-chokered\r\nleader of Sunday-schools who flees to Canada with the cash of the bank\r\nwhere he was cashier is no more of a hypocrite than the president and\r\ndirectors. Religion to all these is one thing, moral conduct quite\r\nanother. They are on a par with the bandit of Italy who hears mass, goes\r\nto confession, and has prayers said in his behalf before going out to\r\nrob and murder. Nor do they differ from the committee of negroes that\r\nwaited on their white preacher and begged him to stop for one Sunday\r\ntalking about lying and stealing, and \"gib 'em one day ob good\r\nole-fashioned glory-to-God religion.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Men and Measures of Half a Century_, by Hugh McCulloch (Charles\r\nScribner's Sons).--Here is a name that will loom up in the hereafter as\r\nthat of one of the ablest financiers given our country. It is lost now\r\nin the yet lingering glare and blare of war, where little men, magnified\r\nby newspapers to gigantic generals, famous for the wanton slaughter of\r\ntheir own men, absorb public attention.\r\n\r\nMr. McCulloch was called to the Secretaryship of the Treasury by\r\nPresident Lincoln, and continued there by Lincoln's successor, Andrew\r\nJohnson. It was the hard task of Mr. McCulloch to rectify the errors of\r\nSalmon P. Chase. This great man had won success for the government in\r\nthe war with the South on his financial blunders. Finding capital so\r\nunpatriotic that it would loan the government no money so long as the\r\nconflict was in doubt, Chase appealed to the people, and made his loans\r\nfrom them in the shape of promises to pay in the currency. While the\r\nsoldiers in the field and the average citizen took a patriotic pride in\r\naccepting this currency at par, the financiers were as busy as Satan in\r\ndepreciating it, until the Secretary was driven to buying up those\r\nmoney-getters. They drove a hard bargain with the oppressed Secretary,\r\nand this bargain ended in turning over a large part of the fiscal agency\r\nof the government, and all the currency, to nearly two thousand\r\ncorporations.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. McCulloch took the portfolio of the Treasury our financial\r\ncondition was most deplorable. The land was flooded with an irredeemable\r\ncurrency, and the source of credit being thus poisoned, all business was\r\nmere gambling. To understand this, one has to remember that in the first\r\nyear of the war a tariff on imports was enacted by Congress that\r\namounted at first to prohibition. In thus closing the door against\r\nforeign capitalists the government raised the prices of all manufactured\r\ngoods against itself. The evil did not end here. As a purchaser of\r\nsupplies in a paper currency for a million of wasteful and extravagant\r\nmen in the field, the government again augmented prices to its own hurt.\r\nAfter the battle of Gettysburg, when the timid capital felt that it was\r\nsafe, not to help an impoverished government, but to make investments,\r\nbonds were taken, paid for in the depreciated currency--and when the war\r\nended, a subsidized Congress, leaving the loan in the shape of currency\r\nmade by the people to take care of itself, enacted that these bonds,\r\nbought in currency, should be redeemed, capital and interest, in gold.\r\n\r\nThis was the situation that faced Mr. McCulloch when sworn in office as\r\nSecretary of the Treasury. He was selected by President Lincoln, and\r\ncontinued in office by Andrew Johnson. A more admirable appointment\r\ncould not have been made. Hugh McCulloch is not only a remarkable man,\r\nbut one singularly well adapted to the position assigned him. An\r\neminently handsome man, he carried a large, healthy brain on a trunk\r\ncapable of great endurance. It was health, good health, throughout. To a\r\nkeen, sensitive intellect he adds a calm, dispassionate temperament and\r\nthe highest courage. Although modest in manner and reticent in speech,\r\nhis very presence commanded respect among his opponents, such as all\r\npositive characters possess; while his friends felt that their cause,\r\nwhatever it might be, was safe in his hands. Trained a banker, he had\r\nmade a success of his banking; and while possessed of a thorough\r\nacquaintance with the details of his business, he had also a\r\nphilosophical knowledge of the science. This is a rare combination.\r\n\r\n\"How little those people know of their own business!\" said Salmon P.\r\nChase to Mr. Richard B. Pullen, of Cincinnati, after a meeting of\r\nbankers the able Secretary of the Treasury had called for consultation.\r\nIt was well for the bankers that such was and is their condition. They\r\nare practical men--that is, men who accept the fact as they see it,\r\nwithout bothering their brains as to the reason for it. The business man\r\nwho sends an order through the telegraph or telephone does not stop to\r\nconsider what strange agency he is using. If he did, he would not only\r\nhave his mind taken from his avocation, but lose the chance of a deal in\r\nthe market. The mind given to and capable of study is one given to\r\ndreaming, not acting.\r\n\r\nThe vast debt owing the people by the government in the shape of\r\ncurrency presented to Secretary McCulloch his first problem that had to\r\nbe solved before credit could be restored and business again put on a\r\nsound, healthy basis. He had the advantage of knowing clearly and\r\nprecisely the work before him. It was the error of the day, as it is the\r\nerror now, to confound currency with money. By money is meant the great\r\nmeasure of value in gold and silver coin determined on by trade and\r\naccepted the world over since trade first began. Currency, on the\r\ncontrary, is that form of credit used in paper to facilitate exchange.\r\nNow, trade calls for a certain amount of this, not so large as is\r\npopularly supposed, but fluctuating in quantity as trade makes its\r\ndemand. Gold and silver cannot be relied on for this purpose, for their\r\nintrinsic value, which makes them a measure of value, forbids. This\r\nmeasure of value, like that of the yard as to length, and the pound as\r\nto weight, becomes an abstract idea. When one seeks to purchase a pair\r\nof shoes, and the shoemaker says that their, price is five dollars, one\r\nmay pay for them five bushels of wheat; so that on both sides a value is\r\ngot at that facilitates the exchange. If currency is used, it, too, has\r\nthe same nature--with this fact added: the intrinsic value of the paper\r\npromise to pay coin lies in the credit of the man, corporation, or\r\ngovernment issuing the promise.\r\n\r\n\"If a man fall down a steep place,\" said the Hon. Tom Benton, \"and get\r\nkilled with a gold dollar in his pocket, and his bones be found a\r\nhundred years after, they will be worth the dollar. If, however, he has\r\na promise to pay a dollar, he has that which depends for value on a\r\nboard of directors sitting around a mahogany table. It may be worth a\r\ndollar and it may be worthless.\"\r\n\r\nThis disposes of the fiat money. We cannot create something out of\r\nnothing by act of Congress. When the government issues its paper, it\r\ncoins its credit into currency. Its value, if it has any, lies in that.\r\n\r\nNow, when Secretary McCulloch took command of the Treasury Department\r\nthe credit of the government was at a heavy discount, and getting less\r\nevery hour. The only class at the North that doubted the ability of the\r\ngovernment to maintain itself in the War of Secession was the moneyed\r\nclass, and this class continued to decry the credit of the government\r\nlong after the war had been brought to a successful conclusion. This,\r\nbecause the condition of discredit was a source of income. They who had\r\nrefused to fetch out their money-bags to aid the government when the\r\nroar of the first artillery was throbbing along the halls of the\r\nCapitol, now sought to fatten on its distress.\r\n\r\nHugh McCulloch found the government financially aground like a stranded\r\nwhale, with sharks eating in at one end, and vultures and wolves at the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nAnd yet all the vast powers of the government are given to the aid and\r\nsupport of this class from which come the sharks, buzzards, and wolves.\r\n\r\nThe new Secretary had this class to contend with; and he had another in\r\nthe form of politicians, the representatives of the people that\r\nrepresented everything but the people's patriotism. Mr. McCulloch knew\r\nthat to restore credit and redeem our currency the volume must be\r\ncontracted. The moneyed class wanted to be let alone--it always wants\r\nthat. The politicians wanted more currency--or money, as they called it.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this trouble, the politicians of the dominant party\r\nsought to make a colony of the entire South, to be governed by\r\ncarpet-baggers and bayonets, because Southern staples could thus be made\r\nto contribute to Northern capital, and the ignorant plantation negroes\r\ncould be used to keep that party in power. In this way half our\r\nterritory and the most valuable of our products were paralyzed.\r\n\r\nFortunately for the country, President Johnson got into a row with both\r\ncapitalists and politicians. As a poor white of the South, he hated\r\nwealth; as a Southerner, he hated Northern politicians. An ignorant,\r\nvicious sort of a man, Johnson was obstinate and courageous. It was,\r\nhowever, a sort of moral courage--if we may use such a term in this\r\nconnection. Probably his nerve had been demoralized by his intemperate\r\nhabits. It is true that the man who in the Senate defied the fierce\r\nslave-holders was the man whom General Don Carlos Buell cowed at\r\nCincinnati, and who ordered the unfortunate and innocent Mrs Surratt to\r\nbe hanged within twenty-four hours, with the recommendation to mercy of\r\nthe court that condemned her before him, and the shrieks of her agonized\r\ndaughter ringing in his ears.\r\n\r\nBe all that as it may, Andrew Johnson, cutting loose from Congress and\r\nthe moneyed class, took the executive government into his own hands.\r\nFew of us realize what a tremendous power is this government of ours.\r\nThe framers of it made it so, to guard against the people in whose\r\nbehalf it was created. The politicians in Congress saw this, and sought\r\nto free themselves of Johnson through impeachment. They charged him with\r\nselecting his cabinet. The charge was absurd, and failed; and while\r\nJohnson, with little dignity and less success, went on fighting\r\npoliticians, Secretary McCulloch used the power given him to contract\r\nour currency, restore our credit, and put the country once more on the\r\nroad to honest trade and its high prosperity.\r\n\r\nNo one, however, must open Hugh McCulloch's book with any hope of\r\nfinding therein a history of this financial crisis and his part in the\r\nrestoration to honor we enjoyed. The author is a modest man, and leaves\r\nto others the truth and the praise the truth awards him.\r\n\r\nThere is a more serious objection to the work, and that comes of Mr.\r\nMcCulloch's marked ignorance of men. While clear-sighted and profound in\r\nhis knowledge of great economic subjects, he scarcely knows one man from\r\nanother, save as they are labelled and described by popular expression.\r\nIt is amusing to run over his list of prominent men and see under each,\r\nif not an official pedestal, one given by social verdict. With the\r\nconservatism of his temperament in his judgment of men, he seldom\r\ndeparts from the recorded estimate of the public. The most ludicrous\r\ninstance of this is his history of Grant and his summing up of the man's\r\nsupposed character. It is the political fiction and newspaper lie of the\r\nday.\r\n\r\nFrom this we can turn to the views of a statesman on finance, the\r\ntariff, and on reconstruction with not only pleasure but profit. So far\r\nwe have three great historical characters to record as financiers:\r\nHamilton because of his luck, Chase for his blunders, and McCulloch for\r\nhis ability.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECENT NOVELS.--The great stream that swells day by day in the form of\r\nprose fiction is simply appalling. It is not only the genius of to-day\r\nthat has seized on this vehicle of thought and feeling, but the amateur\r\npen-driver plunges in without hesitation. Every male citizen of these\r\nUnited States is born to hold office and edit a newspaper. Every female\r\nborn under the stars and stripes comes into the world prepared to write\r\na novel. No study, no preparation whatever is needed. When the Irishman\r\nwas asked if he could play upon the French horn, he responded, \"Shure,\r\nit looks aisy;\" and a love story looks so easy that every little girl is\r\nready to produce one.\r\n\r\nOf the pile before us we of course seize first on that under the name of\r\nJulian Hawthorne. The admiration felt by all for the father, to say\r\nnothing of the love that yet lingers in memory for the man, makes the\r\nname of Hawthorne sacred. It brings to mind the noble, handsome,\r\nCæsarian head of the master, that was made winning by the shy, gentle,\r\nand affectionate manner--so little understood by the many, so\r\nfascinating to the few. Then lived our greatest genius in the world of\r\nfiction. When one realizes the nature of the material upon which he had\r\nto work, the cold, barren soil of New England, the hard, unsympathetic\r\ncharacters, with no background of romance on which to build, the mighty\r\npower of the magician looms up before us. The touch of his pen wrought\r\nsuch strange wonders that the very hardness of the groundwork seemed to\r\nplay into his hand, and from the _Twice-Told Tales_ to that grandest of\r\nall tragedies in the English language, _The Scarlet Letter_, one is held\r\nspellbound.\r\n\r\nWell, it is not belittling Julian to say that it is a misfortune that he\r\nshould be the son of his father. We read his charming stories by the\r\nlight of a past that can never again be renewed, and all the time the\r\nmemory of the mighty master dwarfs the work of the son. In this way I\r\nread aloud to my dear invalid _A Dream and a Forgetting_. Had there been\r\nany other name upon the title-page than Hawthorne, we should have been\r\ncharmed with the book that Belford, Clarke & Co. have gotten up so\r\nbeautifully. As it was, we could not help looking for the sunlight\r\nthrough rifts that, alas! can never come again. It is singular to note,\r\nhowever, the Hawthornish traits that yet linger in the son. The same\r\nboldness that made the elder Hawthorne accept and use without hesitation\r\nthe most unpromising characters, and make them not only acceptable but\r\nattractive, belongs to the younger. It is this which drives him not only\r\nto depict Fairfax Boardwine, but to make his hero such a weak, selfish\r\ncreature. After all, he is only a foil to Mary Gault, and the true work\r\nin the artist lies in the clear yet delicate prominence he gives to his\r\nheroine.\r\n\r\nThe charm the elder Hawthorne threw over the rocky land of New England\r\nis evident in the _Pot of Gold_, by Edward Richard Shaw (Belford, Clarke\r\n& Co.). Here is the barren, sandy coast, with a few rough fishermen, the\r\ncold, heaving sea, enlightened by no love, but made attractive by the\r\nshadowy play of adventure found in piratical ships, that come and go as\r\nif they were phantoms of a half-forgotten past. With all the dim, misty\r\ncharacter of the piratical craft, the author gives us the coast and its\r\natmosphere, the rough, ignorant characters of its inhabitants, in a way\r\nto prove that he is an artist and has made good use of his study. To the\r\naverage reader, as well as the more cultured, this book is very\r\nattractive.\r\n\r\nEdgar Saltus, whose immature book, _The Truth about Tristrem Varick_,\r\nwon him wide mention as the author of a grotesque bit of immorality,\r\ncomes to the front again in _Eden_, a novel published by Belford, Clarke\r\n& Co. There is the marked progress in this volume we prophesied in the\r\nyoung author. He has great ability, marred by certain affectations, that\r\nwill in time, we hope, disappear. Mr. Saltus has been roughly assaulted\r\nby the critics. He probably deserved all that he got. We can say to him,\r\nas the fond parent said to his son after the youth had been kicked in\r\nthe face by a mule, \"He will not be so handsome hereafter, but he will\r\nhave more sense.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Saltus builds his novels on the French methods. His narrative and\r\nconversations find expression in short epigrammatic sentences. To the\r\naverage reader this is easy and delightful, for there is a sense of\r\nwisdom that to such is quite captivating. To the more cultured it has\r\nthe effect of an old-fashioned corduroy road over a swamp. It simply\r\njolts one, and the knowledge that the short sticks and logs cover a\r\nquagmire is not comforting. The characters are nearly all alike; and\r\ntheir conversation so much so, that to a listener to one who reads\r\naloud, omitting the names, it seems to be one person dealing out worldly\r\nwisdom in short, jerky sentences. As a specimen of style we quote:\r\n\r\n     \"Then, Miss Menemon, you must know the penalty which is paid for\r\n     success.\" He straightened himself, the awkwardness had left him,\r\n     and he seemed taller than when he entered the room. \"Yes,\" he\r\n     continued, \"the door to success is very low, and the greater is he\r\n     that bends the most. Let a man succeed in any one thing, and\r\n     whatever may be the factors with which that success is achieved,\r\n     Envy will call a host of enemies into being as swiftly as Cadmus\r\n     summoned his soldiery. And these enemies will come not alone from\r\n     the outer world, but from the ranks of his nearest friends. Ruin a\r\n     man's home, he may forget it. But excel him, do him a favor, show\r\n     yourself in any light his superior, then indeed is the affront\r\n     great. Mediocrity is unforgiving. We pretend to admire greatness,\r\n     but we isolate it and call that isolation Fame. It is above us; we\r\n     cannot touch it; but mud is plentiful and that we can throw. And if\r\n     no mud be at hand, we can loose that active abstraction, malice,\r\n     which subsists on men and things. No; had I an enemy I could wish\r\n     him no greater penance than success--success prompt, vertiginous,\r\n     immense! To the world, as I have found it, success is a crime, and\r\n     its atonement, not death, but torture. Truly, Miss Menemon,\r\n     humanity is not admirable. Men mean well enough, no doubt; but\r\n     nature is against them. Libel is the tribute that failure pays to\r\n     success. If I am slandered, it is because I have succeeded. But\r\n     what is said of my father is wholly true. He did make shoes, God\r\n     bless him! and very good shoes they were. Pardon me for not having\r\n     said so before.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, here is another character speaking, and it seems a continuation\r\nof what we have quoted. It is not; there are nearly a hundred pages\r\nbetween the two, and a world-wide difference in sex. Now read:\r\n\r\n     \"Before I met you I thought myself in love. Oh, but I did, though.\r\n     And it was not until after I had known you that I found that which\r\n     I had taken for love was not love at all. How did I know? Well--you\r\n     see, because that is not love which goes. And that went. It was for\r\n     the man I cared, not the individual. At the time I did not\r\n     understand, nor did I until you came. Truly I don't see why I\r\n     should speak of this. Every girl, I fancy, experiences the same\r\n     thing. But when you came life seemed larger. You brought with you\r\n     new currents. Do you know what I thought? People said I married you\r\n     for money. I married you because--what do you suppose, now? Because\r\n     I loved you? But at that time I told myself I had done with love.\r\n     No, it was not so much for that as because I was ambitious for us\r\n     both. It was because I thought Wall Street too small for such as\r\n     you. It was because I discerned in you that power which coerces\r\n     men. It was because I believed in the future; it was because I\r\n     trusted you. Yes, it was for that, and yet this afternoon--\"\r\n\r\nThe advance made in this brilliant book, for such it is with all its\r\nfaults, from that grotesquely immoral work called _The Truth about\r\nTristrem Varick_, justifies our expressed faith in the ability of Edgar\r\nSaltus. This novel is clearly highly dramatic and intensely interesting.\r\nThere is the making of a foremost master of fiction in the young man\r\nwhen he shall have shaken off his affectations.\r\n\r\n\r\n_His Way and Her Will_, by Fannie Aymar Mathews (Belford, Clarke &\r\nCo.).--This is a vivid picture of our supposed New York social life, as\r\nseen by certain writers of fiction through the plate-glass window of a\r\nfashionable _modiste_ in an atmosphere heavy with the cheap scents of a\r\nbarber-shop. We are introduced to most elegant people of high birth and\r\nculture through many generations. The villain is a villain because he is\r\nthe son of a lowborn and base stonemason.\r\n\r\nWe have two sorts of fiction affected mainly by our American novelists.\r\nOne is of the English sort, not Braddon, but Trollope and Miss Austen,\r\nwhere the interest, of a mild sort, turns on the social law of caste.\r\n\"The hero and the heroine paddle about in the shallow sea of affection,\r\nnever out of sight of the church-steeple,\" and it is a poor plebeian\r\ngirl beloved by a lord, or a noble lady, rich and well-born, who is\r\nsought for by a lover of base origin. The other, or French method, is to\r\nhave the characters tossed upon an awful ocean of passion, where the rag\r\nof chastity is torn in shreds by the lurid storm.\r\n\r\nThe novel before us is of the English class. As we have no aristocracy,\r\none is created. It is, of course, one of birth. The old Knickerbockers\r\nand the Puritans of the Mayflower furnish the lofty pedigree, and\r\nchivalrous gentlemen and silken dames appear in or come out of elegant\r\ndrawing-rooms, and love and make love in a most refined and lofty sort.\r\n\r\nThe stories are not only imaginary, but the foundations for the same are\r\nof the stuff dreams are made of. There is no such social life in this\r\nland of ours. The aristocracy we have here is one of wealth, and of\r\nnecessity is without culture. Money-getting, in its best aspect, is a\r\nmere instinct. As we have to get our living from the hard crust of earth\r\non which we are born, nature has given us the instincts necessary to\r\nthat living, and a man gathers the good things about him very much as\r\nswine seek shelter and make a bed before a viewless coming storm. As we\r\ncultivate the animal we destroy the instinct; hence it is that when a\r\nman ceases to accumulate and goes to spending he loses the power of\r\naccumulation.\r\n\r\nWe do not mean to say by this that a man may not, through an exercise of\r\nhis reason, accumulate property also. The goose that flies a thousand\r\nmiles on a line due north is emulated by the mariner, who, by the use of\r\na compass, will sail with the same accuracy. But the goose carries its\r\nown stomach, and the sailor a rich cargo of silks and velvets. The rule,\r\nor rather, the law, is that when reason takes the place of instinct, the\r\ninstinct is lost. The man who from natural impulse and motive makes his\r\nmoney is unable to enjoy what he has made. He is a mere animal, and of\r\nthese animals is our aristocracy made.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, we apply to American life the characters, motives, and\r\nmanners of European social existence, we make an egregious blunder. The\r\naristocracy of Europe, mainly of England, is not one of wealth alone,\r\nfor many commoners are richer than their lords. Nor is it of pedigree,\r\nfor the great majority of them are without such. It is the power of a\r\nhereditary class. It dominates not only the social but the political\r\nstructure as well. The lords we look up to and dwell upon, so\r\nfascinated, are the masters, and, relieved from the necessary toil for\r\nan existence, have time and means to be cultured.\r\n\r\nIt is a class with the prestige of power. Take this away, and a lord\r\nwould be no more than the ring-master of a circus, and not half so\r\namusing as the clown.\r\n\r\nOur social aristocrats play at being such, and are ring-masters and\r\nclowns, admired by the ignorant and laughed at by all.\r\n\r\nAgain, there is no class in the United States that has the leisure\r\nnecessary to learn. We have no idle class. We have a continuous stream\r\nof would-be aristocrats, but they come and go so rapidly that no time is\r\ngiven for the cultivation of manner, nor can there be the repose\r\nnecessary to aristocratic ways. The duration of family life on Murray\r\nHill, or any other fashionable locality in New York or elsewhere, is\r\nthat of the penitentiary or the car-horse--about five years. All the\r\nfamilies change in that time. Whence they come they carefully conceal;\r\nwhither they go no one cares to learn. There are enormous fortunes made\r\nin a day, that disappear in a night.\r\n\r\nAll the while the money-getting and -losing continue. There is no pause.\r\nThe masculine element of such society is made up of men who carry the\r\nanxieties of their work into parlors and ball-rooms. The late dinners\r\nand later parties are frequented by fathers and brothers who know that\r\nat counting-rooms and offices they must be every morning by ten o'clock,\r\nto worry all day with an anxiety that kills. These noble scions of male\r\nAmerican aristocracy carry protested notes on their dyspeptic\r\ncountenances, and the female specimens their bills for jewelry and\r\ngorgeous wearing apparel. The surface of the whole creation is not even\r\ngood veneer, but the thinnest sort of a scratched varnish.\r\n\r\nWhat absurd fictions, then, are our society novels!\r\n\r\nWe have in reality our social life, and it is of the best and highest.\r\nThe millions of homes over the land have their comedies and tragedies\r\nwell worth putting to record, but they are American, not European. Why\r\ncannot our gifted authors, such as Miss Mathews, for example, turn to\r\nthese and give us a fiction worthy the name? The book she has given us,\r\nwith all its defects, is entertaining. From title-page to close the\r\ninterest in the plot and characters holds the reader who does not look\r\ntoo narrowly into the probability.\r\n\r\nOf the same sort of work is the volume entitled _That Girl from Texas_,\r\nby Jeannette H. Walworth (Belford, Clarke & Co.), an amusing story under\r\na bad name. The idea is not so original, as Sancho Panza remarked, but\r\nwhat we might have met it before. The \"Fair Barbarian\" who invades\r\nEngland and crops out in English novels, much to our discredit, and the\r\nlike character from the far West who assaults fashionable life East, are\r\ngetting to be somewhat monotonous. Society is shocked in both localities\r\nby the rough ways of the maiden; but as she is ever beautiful, rich, and\r\nshrewd, she plays a leading rôle and comes out victor in the end. If\r\n\"Elmira does not stab that deep-dyed villain, the Count,\" she\r\ncircumvents him in the most adroit and unexpected manner, so that virtue\r\ntriumphs and vice is exposed and punished.\r\n\r\nWe cannot comprehend why it is that when a sprig of English nobility\r\nseeks our shores, he should always be a cad or an idiot, and in many\r\ninstances blooming specimens of both. Time was when this specimen proved\r\na fraud, and the so-called lord turned out a lackey. But now his\r\nancestors are the real lace, but his intellect, morals, and manners are\r\nat a heavy discount.\r\n\r\nNor is it understandable why the newly rich of the far West are such\r\nignorant boors, while the same articles at the East are refined and\r\nintellectual. We observe that the difference between the two is to have\r\nthe Western man spell his words as they are pronounced, while all the\r\ncorrect spelling is given to the Eastern gentleman. This is scarcely\r\nfair to the citizen of means from a Texan ranch or a Nevada mine. But\r\nthe dramatic effect is good, so we must not complain.\r\n\r\nAllowing for these slight defects, _That Girl from Texas_ is a well-told\r\nstory, and, like the preceding, _His Way and Her Will_, is a healthy\r\nbook. There is nothing in either to shock even the sense of propriety,\r\nlet alone morals, and both give evidence of a talent for story-telling\r\nthat if properly cultivated will make the fair authors famous.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome years since Théophile Gautier published a strange story of\r\ntransformation in which the soul of the lover was passed to the body of\r\na husband, and the inner life of the husband transferred to the body of\r\nthe lover. Morbidly-inclined readers are referred to this ingenious but\r\ndisgusting work for entertainment. The author of _The Princess Daphne_,\r\ntoo modest to put his or her name upon the title-page (Belford, Clarke &\r\nCo.), to accommodate morbid readers unacquainted with French, has\r\ntranslated Gautier's plot and adapted it to American taste by making the\r\ntransferee female instead of the coarser sex. \"Whether it was worth\r\nwhile to go through so much for so little,\" as Sam Weller's school-boy\r\nremarked when he got done with the alphabet, \"is a matter of taste.\" We\r\nthink, in the case of _The Princess Daphne_, that it was not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE QUEEN OF THE BLOCK.\r\n\r\nBY ALEXANDER L. KINKEAD.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE QUEEN'S BIRTHDAY BALL.\r\n\r\nBill Kellar played the first fiddle and called the figures; Blind Benner\r\nwas second fiddle, and Hunch Blair blew the cornet. A curious trio they\r\nwere.\r\n\r\nWilliam Kellar had come from an Eastern city, where he had been the\r\nleader of a successful orchestra. The noises of the streets had proved\r\ntoo much for his sensitive hearing, and he had fled from them to the\r\nstillness of the forest. He lived at the foot of Coot Hill, where he was\r\nfrequently visited by Blind Benner, a young man to whom he had taken a\r\nfancy and whom he taught to play on the violin.\r\n\r\nBlind Benner had a Christian name, but the people of Three-Sisters did\r\nnot know what it was, and they always spoke of him by the title his\r\ninfirmity suggested.\r\n\r\nHunch Blair did odd jobs at the furnace store at Three-Sisters, a\r\nvillage located at the foot of a spur of the Alleghany Mountains. Only\r\nhis father called Hunch by his Christian name. He was a mannish dwarf.\r\nSomewhere he had learned to play the cornet.\r\n\r\nThese were the musicians at the Queen's ball, and lively music they\r\nplayed.\r\n\r\n\"Move round there, you huckleberry-huckster, and keep some sort of time\r\nto the music,\" Bill shouted at Mrs. Wright from Tihank.\r\n\r\nShe sold berries in their season and was a quaint character. Spurred by\r\nthe caller's sharp reprimand, she got ahead of the others, and left her\r\npartner before it was time to \"turn corners.\"\r\n\r\nHe was none other than the stalwart, handsome, dignified owner of the\r\nThree-Sister furnaces, and known to all the iron trade as Colonel Jerry\r\nHornberger. He had honored the Queen's ball with his presence and was\r\ndancing the first quadrille with Mrs. Wright.\r\n\r\n\"Seat your partners,\" Bill shouted presently, \"and give Hunch a chance\r\nto fill that extra lung he carries on his back.\"\r\n\r\nThe party was given in honor of Elizabeth McAnay, the Queen of the Block\r\nof Blazes, who had become twenty-one that day.\r\n\r\nTall, strong, light-footed, and graceful, she was the best dancer in\r\nThree-Sisters and eagerly sought as a partner at all the balls. Although\r\nnot pretty, her face was full of character. Her eyes and hair, which was\r\nworn short, were black. Her walk was erect, and her manner regal. She\r\nwas always grave and dignified, yet could enter heartily into the spirit\r\nof a jolly occasion. However, she never lost her womanly dignity as many\r\ngirls do at balls or parties in the country, by playing practical jokes\r\non the young men; and because she would not join in such tricks, one of\r\nthe girls had given her the nickname, \"The Queen of the Block.\"\r\n\r\n\"Twenty-one dances, mind,\" said Bill, tuning his fiddle for the second\r\ndance. \"Your positions for number two. Huckleberries, you dance here\r\nwhere I can tap you with the fiddle-bow.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Wright, taking a place on the floor by the side of John\r\nGillfillan, the head clerk at the furnace store, turned up her nose at\r\nBill, and joined another set.\r\n\r\nSnap! Blind Benner broke a fiddle string, and was so grieved that he\r\ncould not play that Bill delayed the dance until the string was again\r\ntuned.\r\n\r\nElizabeth was dancing with her oldest brother Levi. Her partner in the\r\nfirst quadrille had been her aged father, who danced no more that night.\r\n\r\nLevi was tall and wore his hair long, falling on his shoulders. He was a\r\nschool-teacher, and a strange combination of faculties found expression\r\nin his methods of instruction and discipline. His smile was potent with\r\nhis pupils being both their reward and punishment; to the deserving it\r\nwas a benediction, to the unfaithful it was a mocking grin, confounding\r\nand abashing them. He was gallant to his sister, and walked gracefully\r\nthrough the dance with her.\r\n\r\nElizabeth's partner in the third dance was Matthew McAnay, her brother,\r\nfour years older than she. By occupation a wood-chopper, he was an\r\nactive, strong man, but rather a clumsy dancer. Sometimes his face wore\r\na smile similar to Levi's; to acquaintances it was tantalizing, to\r\nstrangers annoying.\r\n\r\nCassius McAnay was Elizabeth's partner in the fourth dance. He, too, was\r\nher brother, two years her senior, and much like their elder brothers.\r\nHe was his father's assistant in the coaling.\r\n\r\nAfter the fourth dance John Gillfillan made his way along the ball-room\r\nto Elizabeth's side. The change of her manner as she accepted his arm\r\nfor the next dance showed how welcome he was, yet they were not avowed\r\nlovers. He had not made his declaration, but she was expecting it that\r\nnight. It came, yet not as she had hoped for it.\r\n\r\nThe ball-room was a long porch, which had once been the platform where\r\nfreight was received when the Block had been a warehouse, Three-Sisters\r\nat that time being the terminus of a railroad. When the railroad was\r\ncarried farther up the river, the warehouse was found to be unnecessary,\r\nand Colonel Hornberger, desiring to turn it into a tenement-house,\r\nbought it from the railroad company.\r\n\r\nIn it a dozen families could be comfortably accommodated, each family\r\nhaving five rooms, three upstairs and two down. The long platform was\r\ndivided by fences, and to each door steps led from the street. In the\r\nopenings thus made in the floor of the platform trap-doors were fitted.\r\n\r\nThese porches were the wash-rooms of the families; and on a Monday, when\r\nthe washing of clothes took place, so many quarrels arose between the\r\nwomen that the house was given the nickname of the Block of Blazes.\r\n\r\nOn the night of Elizabeth's party there was harmony in the Block. The\r\nwash-tubs and benches were removed, the middle fences were taken away,\r\nthe trap-doors were down, and the platform made a dancing-floor, which\r\nwas lighted by candles placed in the windows, and by perforated\r\nstable-lanterns, swung on ropes above the heads of the dancers.\r\n\r\nJohn, or Gill, as he was called, conducted Lizzi--for that was what her\r\nbrothers shortened her name to--to the end of the porch opposite the\r\nmusicians, who had seats raised above the floor.\r\n\r\nMany of the guests were grouped near this platform, gathered around\r\nJacob McAnay and his wife; and Gill and Lizzi had the other end of the\r\nporch to themselves. She leaned over the rail and looked at a star\r\ntwinkling near the horizon, which was made in the West for Three-Sisters\r\nby a ridge that was precipitous and high.\r\n\r\n\"Lizzi,\" said Gill, \"will you be my wife?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will, John.\"\r\n\r\nThe shrill voice of Bill Kellar broke upon their ears.\r\n\r\n\"Cotton, Lizzi! cotton, quick! or there'll be no more dancing here\r\nto-night.\"\r\n\r\nLizzi turned impatiently toward him.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind him; he's drunk,\" said Gill.\r\n\r\n\"Lizzi, the devil is here, and wants a dance, and if I don't get some\r\ncotton for my ears, I'll have to give it to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must humor him, John,\" said Lizzi, and disappeared in the house.\r\n\r\nThere she encountered Gret Reed, Seth Reed's wife, who, knowing Bill's\r\neccentricities, had gone for some cotton when he first asked for it.\r\n\r\n\"I have it, Lizzi,\" said Gret; \"your mother told me where it was.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just like you, Gret; always the first to do anything that is asked.\"\r\n\r\nGret took the cotton to Bill, who stuffed it in his ears. Then he\r\nshouted, \"Partners for the fifth dance.\"\r\n\r\nGill led Lizzi to the floor. She was very happy, betrothed to the man\r\nshe loved. How light her step, how graceful her movement, as the tall,\r\ncomely girl walked through the quadrille by the side of her promised\r\nhusband!\r\n\r\nAfter the dancers were seated when this quadrille was finished, Bill\r\ntook Hunch aside and asked:\r\n\r\n\"Hunch, are you afraid of the devil?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ain't afeard uv nuthin'!\"\r\n\r\nHunch looked it. His wrinkled old face, with its expression of cunning,\r\nand his disfigured form suggested that he was on intimate terms with all\r\nsorts of evil spirits.\r\n\r\n\"The devil is here to-night, Hunch, begging me to play for him to dance,\r\nand I don't want to hear him. That's why I put the cotton in my ears.\r\nBut I will have to play for him. He never lets me go without a dance\r\nwhen he comes around. If I refuse to play, he gives me a lower-region\r\nchills-and-fever that makes my bones ache and my flesh burn. But\r\nto-night he will have to wait until the party is over; then I will play\r\nfor him. He will dance on the roof. When I give you the nod, just take\r\nyour cornet, sneak up on the roof and blow a hole through him, will\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will thet;\" and Hunch jerked his head in a way that showed he\r\nintended to ventilate Satan effectively.\r\n\r\nWhen Bill returned to the musician's stand, Blind Benner, who knew the\r\nmood that was upon his master, asked the privilege of playing second\r\nfiddle for the devil's dance.\r\n\r\n\"Sorry, Benner, but Old Nick wouldn't have it. He will dance to but one\r\nfiddle, and insists that I shall play it. And if he don't get his dance\r\nto-night, he will give me an ague that quinine won't cure.\"\r\n\r\nBlind Benner looked sad. Hunch was given the privilege of driving Satan\r\naway; but he could not extend to his teacher, tortured into playing for\r\nthe demoniacal dance, the sympathy of an accompanying violin. With a\r\nsigh, he twanged the strings of his violin to learn if they were in\r\ntune.\r\n\r\nThe last dance was a Virginia Reel. With Colonel Hornberger as a\r\npartner, Lizzi took the head to lead off.\r\n\r\nWhen the reel was finished, the guests prepared to leave.\r\n\r\n\"Not yet,\" shouted Bill. \"Don't go yet. Seats, everybody, and we will\r\nhave a jig by the devil.\"\r\n\r\nA shiver passed over the guests, and they remained standing in groups.\r\n\r\nBill, who was tuning his violin, seemed to have been suddenly\r\ntransformed. A demon seemed to have taken possession of him. His look\r\nwas wild, and his eagerness to play almost a frenzy. Before he put the\r\ninstrument under his chin he unstopped his ears. Immediately, when his\r\nbow crossed the strings, he gave himself up to a delirium of melody. His\r\neyes glared, and his body swayed. His auditors were frightened into\r\nsilence. However, Hunch was self-possessed, and held his horn ready to\r\nperforate Satan with a blast from it. Blind Benner wept silently.\r\n\r\nFinally Bill nodded, and Hunch hastened from the porch. A minute after\r\nhe entered the Block, a discordant blast from the roof broke the spell,\r\nrestored the player to his senses, and relieved the others, who to this\r\nday declare that they distinctly heard the cloven hoof keeping time to\r\nthe music on the shingles.\r\n\r\nOn his way home Bill muttered:\r\n\r\n\"What infernal business had Old Nick at Lizzi's party?\"\r\n\r\nIn after-time he knew.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nGILL ELECTS A SQUIRE.\r\n\r\nJohn Gillfillan was chief clerk at the furnace store. Upon him was the\r\nentire responsibility of its management; to him was given the sole\r\ncharge of its business. Colonel Hornberger was always boasting of his\r\nability and trustworthiness, and made him his deputy with full power to\r\nact for him. John went to the city and bought the goods for the store\r\nand put the selling price on them. He knew just how much stock there was\r\non hand. He was a genius in a way, having a remarkable memory, which\r\nrelieved him of the trouble of keeping an order book. Gill was the\r\nquickest and shrewdest buyer with whom the wholesalers had to deal.\r\n\r\nHe was handsome, tall, broad-shouldered, muscular, and always\r\nwell-dressed. His mustache and hair were dark, almost black; his eyes\r\ngray.\r\n\r\nIn the furnishing of his room, which was on the second story of the\r\nstore building, a taste almost effeminate was displayed. A stranger\r\nentering it would think a woman dwelt there.\r\n\r\nWhen he went to it after leaving the McAnay ball he sat down, not to\r\nthink in superstitious wonder of the strange fancy of Bill Kellar's, but\r\nto recall the words, actions, looks, of the graceful and willowy girl\r\nwho had said, \"I will, John.\"\r\n\r\n\"She has more pride than Queen Elizabeth,\" he muttered. \"No 'Thank you'\r\nto me; but 'I will, John.' Lizzi, you are the comeliest girl I know, and\r\nI have got your promise to be my wife. Well, so much.\"\r\n\r\nHard, unfeeling words, dictated by passion. Love is tender, generous;\r\nPassion, harsh and selfish. They sit opposite at the same feast. Love\r\nsurrenders to the intoxication of the scene, grateful to be allowed\r\nthere. Passion glances scornfully at foolish Love and considers his\r\npresence at the banquet a compliment to the giver. Love treasures the\r\ncrumbs. Passion wastes basketfuls.\r\n\r\n\"So far, so good,\" Gill murmured. \"I'll go to Jim Harker to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nAnd without one tender thought for the woman, who even then, all\r\na-tremble with delight at being his betrothed, was uttering a prayer for\r\nhim, he threw himself on the bed and went asleep.\r\n\r\nLizzi did not sleep. Gill's declaration of love, as she regarded his\r\nproposition of marriage, had opened the door of the future, and her eyes\r\nwere fastened on the scenes that imagination conjured up beyond the\r\nthreshold. She lay awake looking at them, all beaming in the sunlight.\r\n\r\n\"Squire, can you keep a secret?\"\r\n\r\nJames Harker, shoemaker to Three-Sisters, sat in front of his shop,\r\nsmoking, when Gill addressed him. The title flattered him, coming from\r\nso influential a person. He was a candidate for the office of Justice of\r\nthe Peace. At the polls on the following Tuesday--the McAnay ball was on\r\nWednesday--it would be decided whether Squire Parsons should retain the\r\nright to issue warrants and summon law-breakers before him, or have only\r\nthe dignity of the title, while James Harker, formerly shoemaker,\r\noccupied the office and received the fees.\r\n\r\nJim looked piqued by Gill's question.\r\n\r\n\"Keep a secret? Humph! do yer take me fer a woman?\"\r\n\r\nGill laughed and stroked his mustache. \"I'll bet you ten dollars if I\r\nwas to tell you a secret that you couldn't keep it an hour.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ten dollars is skeerce with me, Gill; but I'll hev ter go yer thet much\r\nanyhow.\"\r\n\r\nFrom somewhere in his clothes Jim produced a greasy wallet, which he\r\nopened. He took from it a ten-dollar gold piece. Gill promptly mated it,\r\nbut modified the time.\r\n\r\n\"An hour's too short a time for a fair test.\"\r\n\r\nJim replaced the money in his wallet. Gill tossed his gold piece into\r\nthe air, caught it as it fell, balanced it on the tip of his finger, and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"Jim, how would you like to have this shiner for your first\r\nwedding-fee?\"\r\n\r\nJim's eyes dilated.\r\n\r\n\"Well, yer wouldn't think I'd objec', would yer?\"\r\n\r\nGill laughed and slipped the coin into his pocket. Jim's face betrayed\r\nhis eagerness for the gold.\r\n\r\n\"Let's go into the shop. I've something particular to say to you,\" said\r\nGill.\r\n\r\nThey entered, and Jim shut the door. Gill dropped into the shoemaker's\r\nseat and laid the lap-board on his knees.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know, Jim, that Squire Parsons is going to be hard to beat?\"\r\n\r\nJim sat down on a stool and drew a heavy breath, which was an admission\r\nthat he was of that opinion.\r\n\r\nGill had a knife in his hand and was cutting a piece of leather into\r\nstrips. The shoemaker, too cunning to force the conversation, looked on\r\nin silence. Finally Gill said: \"But I believe we can do it, Jim.\"\r\n\r\n\"Think so?\" Jim asked carelessly.\r\n\r\nGill took another piece of leather and, after whetting the knife on the\r\nside of the bench, began cutting a shoe-string. When he finished it, he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"Jim, if you will promise to do me a favor, I'll elect you.\"'\r\n\r\nWithout looking up, or waiting for an answer, he began cutting another\r\nstring, running the knife dextrously around the circular piece of\r\nleather. With great difficulty Jim restrained a promise to do anything\r\nGill might ask. He began to feel his way cautiously.\r\n\r\n\"If it be in my power as an honest jedge.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not in the habit of asking impossibilities.\"\r\n\r\nGill was pointing the ends of the shoe-strings, and appeared very\r\nindifferent as to whether Squire Parsons remained in office or not. His\r\ncoolness proved too much for the shoemaker, whose greed had been greatly\r\nexcited. He leaped to his feet and held up his right hand.\r\n\r\n\"I'll do it. I swear I will.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sit down, Jim, and keep cool. This is to be a bargain, and bargains\r\nmade in cold blood are surest kept.\"\r\n\r\nJim resumed his seat and stared in amazement at Gill, who, sure of his\r\nman, seemed to take interest only in the shoe-strings he held before\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"Guess I'll send these to Squire Parsons with your compliments, Jim, as\r\na hint that we'll string him up.\"\r\n\r\nA poor attempt at wit, but it had the desired effect, and Jim was soon\r\nas calm as Gill could desire. Then he threw the shoe-strings away and\r\nproceeded to business.\r\n\r\n\"I mean to elect you Justice of the Peace, Jim. That office will\r\nmaterially increase your income. In return for my exertions in your\r\nbehalf, I expect you to marry me. You will be elected on Tuesday. On\r\nWednesday night you will meet me at the church and unite me to the woman\r\nof my choice. I will pay you a fee and, besides, will bet you twenty\r\ndollars in gold that you will be the first to tell of a marriage which\r\nfor good reasons my intended wife and I desire to be kept secret for\r\nsome time.\"\r\n\r\nJim rose, delighted that the favor asked of him would be so easily\r\ngranted.\r\n\r\n\"Say, Gill, thet's all right; yer needn't make the bet. Yer jist 'lect\r\nme squire, an' I'll marry yer fer nuthin' and never tell a soul.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I think I'll win, that's why I want to bet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, I'll jist take yer up.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right; it's a wager.\"\r\n\r\nHis business completed, Gill returned to the store.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSquire Parsons was defeated by two votes, and great was the astonishment\r\nin Three-Sisters, where everybody believed that John Gillfillan, clerk\r\nof the election, was a surety against fraud.\r\n\r\nBut Gill gave little thought to the deceit that had placed Jim Harker in\r\nthe office of Justice of the Peace, for he had a weightier matter on his\r\nmind--theft. For more than two years he had been stealing systematically\r\nfrom the cash-box, and protected himself from discovery by false entries\r\nin the books. The money thus obtained he had lost at the gaming-table\r\nduring his semi-annual visits to the city for the purpose of buying\r\ngoods. As soon as he got back to the store he began thieving again in\r\nsmall amounts, in order to accumulate capital for another venture when\r\nhe next visited the city.\r\n\r\nLuck having been so persistently against him, he had determined to learn\r\nthe art of juggling with cards, and purchased a book of instruction in\r\nthat line. With this open before him and a pack of cards in his hands he\r\nsat in his daintily furnished room on the night of the election. He\r\ncontinued to shuffle and cut the cards until near midnight, when he\r\nrose, muttering as he concealed the pack and book:\r\n\r\n\"I think that practice will make me an expert at cards, and I'll win\r\nnext time; but I don't propose to risk much longer the chances of being\r\ncaught by Colonel Hornberger. Something has got to happen to those\r\nbooks, or they will tell on me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nIN SUGAR CAMP HOLLOW.\r\n\r\nGill did not caution Lizzi to keep their engagement secret. He knew she\r\nwould, for every true woman enjoys alone for a short time the knowledge\r\nthat her love is reciprocated. She does not hasten to tell that she has\r\nhad a proposal and accepted it. To her such conduct seems eagerness to\r\nboast of a good bargain. And Gill reckoned rightly when he esteemed\r\nLizzi a true woman.\r\n\r\nHe did not speak of his intended marriage to any one but Jim Harker. It\r\ndid not occur to Lizzi that he was trying to see as little of her as\r\npossible. Very busy at opening and marking the fall invoice of new\r\ngoods, he saw her only when he passed the Block on his way to the\r\nwarehouse, or when she came to the store. On these occasions he was very\r\ngallant, and addressed her with a meaning in his tones and looks that\r\nher heart quickly interpreted.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSugar Camp Hollow was the shortest cut from Three-Sisters to the farm on\r\nwhich an uncle of Lizzi lived. It was a long, deep ravine, where grew\r\ngreat towering pines and graceful sugar-maples. These latter gave it the\r\nname. Every spring there was a sugar-boiling at the mouth of the hollow.\r\nIn the fall and winter the deer herded in the laurel thickets near the\r\ntop of the mountain. A narrow path ran the length of the ravine, and\r\nfrom a spring near the mountain-top a noisy brook rolled to the\r\nmountain's foot and tumbled into the river.\r\n\r\nLizzi's aunt was ill, and, on the Sunday following her engagement,\r\nLizzi, with a basket full of good things, went to visit her. The day was\r\nvery still, and she enjoyed the deep silence of the woods, broken only\r\nby the rustling of the dead leaves as she stepped lightly on them.\r\nSometimes she paused to let the quiet rest her.\r\n\r\nAs she turned a sharp bend in the path she discovered Gill waiting for\r\nher, and uttered an exclamation of glad surprise. Putting down the\r\nbasket, she let him fold her in his arms. Her heart beat quickly and\r\nstrongly. He felt it throb, and a thrill startled his steady nerves.\r\nLifting her head from his shoulder, he took her face in both hands and\r\ndrew it slowly closer to his, feasting his eyes on it. She looked a\r\nquick protest and then yielded. A flush mantled her cheeks.\r\n\r\nHe would have repeated the kiss, but she would not let him. Repetition\r\nwould be profanation in her eyes and he understood her refusal. Ever\r\nafter in her life she regarded that first kiss as sacred.\r\n\r\nUsually his manner was lightsome, but to-day it was subdued.\r\n\r\n\"Why have you got such a long face, John? Ain't you glad to see me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course I am.\"\r\n\r\nHe pressed her hand and looked away from her. The sad smile on his face\r\nwas succeeded by an expression of dejection.\r\n\r\n\"Sit down on this log and tell me what's the matter.\"\r\n\r\nGill sat on the log and looked down the mountain-side to the village\r\nbelow. Lizzi took a seat close to him, and waited for his confidence.\r\nApparently he was hesitating.\r\n\r\n\"What am I for if you can't tell me your troubles?\" she asked\r\nimpulsively, and caught him by the arm.\r\n\r\nThus encouraged, Gill said:\r\n\r\n\"I had a letter from mother, yesterday.\"\r\n\r\nShe withdrew her hand quickly, sat erect and waited for him to continue,\r\nready to become intensely jealous of that mother, who was probably some\r\nselfish old woman that would not let her son marry.\r\n\r\nGill took from his pocket a neatly folded, daintily perfumed letter, the\r\nchirography of which was like steel-engraving. From it he read:\r\n\r\n\"'There are indications in your letter just received and read with the\r\neagerness of a mother homesick for her only child, that your affections\r\nfor the first time in your life are feeling with restless tendrils for a\r\nplace to cling to in another woman's heart.'\"\r\n\r\nGill could see from the corner of his eye the resolute expression melt\r\non Lizzi's face and a gentle glow of color appear on her cheeks, while a\r\nsoft look suffused her eyes. He continued:\r\n\r\n\"'Now I hasten to warn you. I care not how beautiful, how accomplished\r\nthe woman is who enthralls you; if I hear again of this--rather, I\r\nshould say, that if you do not write to me that you are free, I shall\r\nmake my will according to your father's directions.'\"\r\n\r\nLizzi had placed one arm on his shoulder and was reading the beautifully\r\nwritten lines, breathlessly looking for the threat she knew they\r\nembodied. When she saw it she rose to her feet, and passed her hand\r\nquickly over her eyes as if to brush away something that prevented her\r\nfrom seeing clearly. Gill stood up too, and, grasping her shoulder with\r\none hand, gave her a little shake.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you see, Lizzi? I have been in love with you for a long time and\r\ngave mother a hint to learn her opinion, and then before the reply came,\r\nmy heart broke from its bonds, and I told you my love.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\" said Lizzi, interrogatively.\r\n\r\n\"And then I got this letter, threatening to disinherit me, as my father\r\ndirected I should be if I married without my mother's consent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\" again the plaintive interrogation. Then by a sudden great effort\r\nshe overcame the doubt that had for the moment shackled her. She loosed\r\nhis grasp, picked up the basket, and, standing erect with one foot\r\nadvanced, a queen abdicating a throne, said:\r\n\r\n\"Write to her you are free.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I will not.\"\r\n\r\nHis reply was positive. He stood before her, blocking her way, himself\r\naroused to earnestness that needed no affectation, for it was honest. He\r\nhad just discovered how unselfish a woman's love can be, and reckoned\r\nupon it as the last means of retaining his promised wife.\r\n\r\n\"See,\" and he tore into bits the beautiful letter. \"Thus do I leave my\r\nmother for you, Elizabeth; but it will break her heart, it will shorten\r\nher life.\"\r\n\r\nHis head drooped, his chin touched his chest. Lizzi was touched by his\r\ngrief, and for him had great compassion. She still held the basket on\r\nher left bended arm. With her free hand she gave his forehead a\r\nquivering pressure.\r\n\r\n\"Wait, John, till your mother dies; then I will be your wife.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot. I will not!\"\r\n\r\nHe lifted his hand determinedly. She still held the basket, her right\r\nhand clasping the left, her posture signifying that she was pausing for\r\nhim to let her pass. He gave her an imploring look, but she was\r\ninflexible. Her face had assumed a softened yet determined expression.\r\nRegret and resolve had mingled their lines and gave her features a sad\r\ntenderness. She was merciful, yet resolute.\r\n\r\nGill pulled aside the overhanging branch of a tree and bowed to let her\r\npass.\r\n\r\nA sigh parted her lips as she gave him her hand in farewell. He seized\r\nit eagerly and held it firmly. She endeavored to take it from him, but\r\nnot rudely. He loosed his grasp slightly and his hold became clinging in\r\nits significance. Her bursting heart, for she was giving up her life to\r\nher pride, rightly interpreted the meaning of this change in the\r\npressure of his hand, and she thought of the tendrils spoken of in his\r\nmother's letter. Yes, they clung to her heart, and she could not roughly\r\ntear them away. So she lingered.\r\n\r\nHe gave her hand a pull, bending it until the wrist would not give way.\r\nHolding it thus, he said despairingly.\r\n\r\n\"I thought, Lizzi, you could arrange it some way.\"\r\n\r\nHe tried to lift her hand to his lips, but her wrist was firm.\r\n\r\n\"Can't you help me, Lizzi?\"\r\n\r\nThe wrist yielded, her hand was at his lips. She let him kiss it, and\r\nthen set down her basket.\r\n\r\nGill knew he had won. But she would have her hand free, for that would\r\ngive her a feeling of independence. At the first hint he released it.\r\nShe interlocked it with the other and looked meditatively at the ground,\r\nmoving a loose stone with the toe of her shoe.\r\n\r\n\"I don't like bein' married as if I was ashamed of it.\"\r\n\r\nShe was suggesting a clandestine marriage, just what he wanted. He met\r\nthe question frankly.\r\n\r\n\"It does look cowardly in me to ask such a thing; but if I get that\r\nmoney, I could buy an interest in the furnaces from Colonel Hornberger,\r\nand we could live as well as they do.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would be nice to have a home like the Hornbergers'. If we was rich,\r\nI'd want long hair. Guess it will grow, though;\" and she ran one hand\r\nthrough it, shaking it out.\r\n\r\n\"I like it better as it is,\" and he played with it too.\r\n\r\n\"Do you, dear? Then I'll never have it long again.\"\r\n\r\n\"And your father is old enough to quit working. We could give him and\r\nyour mother a good home, and I'd help Levi become a lawyer. We could do\r\nlots of things if we had mother's money. She is old and won't live long,\r\nperhaps a couple of years.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us wait for two years.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I will not. If you do not marry me, I will go away.\"\r\n\r\n\"John, would you marry me and give up the money--marry me before people\r\nand send your mother word?\"\r\n\r\n\"I would, indeed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I will marry you and not let people know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, sweetheart. You are so good!\"\r\n\r\nHe would have kissed her again, but she would not let him. Her heart was\r\nsore at having consented to a secret marriage.\r\n\r\n\"Let us be married on Wednesday night after prayer-meeting.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! I couldn't get a new dress by that time.\"\r\n\r\nGill laughed at her vanity.\r\n\r\n\"I thought you looked the prettiest I ever saw you on your birthday.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would you like me to wear that dress?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, dear.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will if you want me to, but I must hurry to aunt's, or she'll think\r\nI'm lost.\"\r\n\r\nGill lifted the heavy basket and went with her.\r\n\r\nThe gentle autumn day was asleep on the crazy patchwork quilt spread\r\nover the vast mountains, and the lovers walked along in silence, lest\r\nthey should disturb its rest.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHREE-SISTERS.\r\n\r\nIt is one town and not three contiguous villages as its name might\r\nsuggest. Three blast-furnaces stood on the bank of the river below the\r\ntown. These Colonel Hornberger had named for his daughters, Martha,\r\nSarah, and Henrietta. So the town that grew up near them came to be\r\nknown as Three-Sisters, and was often spoken of as Three-Girls.\r\n\r\nOn all sides of it mountains, through which there were three gaps, rise\r\nprecipitously. Through one of the gaps Boomer Creek, a clear and rapid\r\nstream, given to sudden rises, runs into the river, which is picturesque\r\nand famous, and almost encircles the town. Through another gap the river\r\nglides to the village, and by still another pursues its journey towards\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\nBeginning above the town, and running parallel to the river, the race\r\nconducts the water to the huge wheels in the bellows-house and at the\r\nsaw-mill.\r\n\r\nThe railroad runs to the left of the village, crossing the flat on which\r\nit is built, while the river flows to the right.\r\n\r\nA long wooden covered bridge spans the river and race, and the island\r\nbetween them, and connects Three-Sisters with Boomer Creek Valley, in\r\nwhich are many farms that are gradually encroaching on the forests.\r\n\r\nMany of the streets and alleys in the town were given high-sounding\r\ntitles, but nearly all have their nicknames. The street on which the\r\nproprietor dwells is called Big-bug Avenue. There are Goose Street and\r\nBackbiter's Alley. Harmony Lane is where the worst wranglers in the\r\nvillage live. And there is the Block-of-Blazes, standing at the head of\r\nBig-bug Avenue, yet giving it the cold shoulder, for not a door of the\r\nBlock opens, not a window looks, except askance, upon the Avenue.\r\n\r\nThe people of Three-Sisters, in the days of this story, were laborious,\r\nfrugal, and patient; they had few grievances. Strikes were unheard of,\r\nand no trouble was fermented, except by the tavern whiskey, which flowed\r\nfreely on Saturday nights, when there were frequent fights among the\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nThe women were given to gossip, but were honest. Scandal was rare among\r\nthem, and they prided themselves on being good cooks and tidy\r\nhousewives.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE QUEEN'S WEDDING.\r\n\r\n\"Weddin's-day.\"\r\n\r\nLizzi's happy thoughts would play upon the word Wednesday, and the\r\ngentle breeze in the pines above her made sweet accompaniment to the\r\ntuneful repetition.\r\n\r\nShe sat where Gill had said he would meet her, in the pine-grove at the\r\nedge of which stood the church. She had dressed and left home early,\r\napparently for a walk, but now when the church-bell rung the call for\r\nprayer she was at the trysting-place.\r\n\r\n\"My wedding-bell,\" she murmured as the mellow solemn tones fell\r\nquivering on the air. When they ceased the echo floated to her, a\r\nfar-away sound almost silence. Clasping her hands, she bowed her head in\r\nthankfulness.\r\n\r\n\"The angels up in heaven ring my weddin'-bell too, and that means John\r\nand I will be happy.\"\r\n\r\nThere was in this muscular daughter of the forest (she was born in a\r\ncabin in the woods) a gentle womanliness that was charming. As the hour\r\ndrew near when she would give up her maiden name and freedom, she\r\nthought Time surely ought to go more slowly. He had taken his ease from\r\nSunday until now, though she, running ahead, had pulled him along; but\r\nnow, when only one short hour of her maidenhood was left, the contrary\r\nold fellow would run.\r\n\r\nShe blushed when, all too soon, she saw her promised husband enter the\r\ngrove; and when he took her hand it trembled.\r\n\r\n\"What, Lizzi, not scared by the dark?\"\r\n\r\nThe pressure he gave her hand and the light laugh that followed his\r\nwords corrected their impression, and the sharp pain they caused was\r\nsoothed by the knowledge that he really understood.\r\n\r\n\"What if it had been some other man going through the grove?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Then my hand wouldn't have shook.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the coming of the bridegroom that made her heart beat more\r\nquickly and her hand unsteady.\r\n\r\nGill repaid her for the pretty compliment with a kiss. Then they\r\napproached the church, which was wrapped in darkness.\r\n\r\nJim Harker, sexton and squire, had put out the lights after\r\nprayer-meeting was dismissed, and closed the shutters. Inside the church\r\nhe was waiting.\r\n\r\nLizzi hesitated when, in answer to Gill's knock, the door was thrown\r\nopen and she saw that the church was dark.\r\n\r\n\"Go in, Lizzi,\" said Gill. \"We'll have a light as soon as the door is\r\nshut. If the church was lit up, somebody would see us go in, and come to\r\npeep to see what we was doin'.\"\r\n\r\nShe stepped into the close darkness. Gill followed, and Jim shut the\r\ndoor. Lizzi gave a little start when she heard the click of the latch,\r\nand a shiver ran over her. She was not frightened, only realizing that\r\nthe door of her maiden life was closed behind her.\r\n\r\nSquire Harker lighted two candles, and Lizzi's eyes blinked in the\r\nyellow light but soon they were able to pierce the semi-darkness, and to\r\nher surprise she could discover no preacher. She had thought him part of\r\nthe romance. To no plan of Gill's had she objected after consenting to a\r\nsecret marriage, but she had never dreamed otherwise than that the\r\nceremony would be performed by a clergyman. When she saw Squire Harker,\r\nshe supposed, because he was sexton, Gill had taken him into confidence\r\nand he was present because of his duties at the church, putting out the\r\nlights and locking it up.\r\n\r\nGill seemed as much astounded as she that there was no preacher present,\r\nand asked rather sharply why he had gone. Squire Harker replied that the\r\npreacher had been detained at the other end of the circuit by quarterly\r\nmeeting.\r\n\r\n\"It's too confounded bad!\" said Gill, angrily.\r\n\r\n\"It's bad luck to put off a weddin',\" said Lizzi, disappointed.\r\n\r\n\"I think so, too,\" Gill remarked, and then asked, as if the idea had\r\njust struck him:\r\n\r\n\"Why not be married by the Squire?\"\r\n\r\nLizzi, dressed in her best, demurred. She thought a church-wedding\r\nshould be conducted by a preacher.\r\n\r\n\"A marriage ceremony performed by a Justice of the Peace is as binding\r\nand respectable as any churchman's,\" Gill urged.\r\n\r\n\"It's common-like, though,\" Lizzi replied; \"but I'd be married by a\r\nsquire rather than put it off.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will have to do it then,\" Gill said, in a tone that did not conceal\r\nhis chagrin at having to be wedded by a Justice of the Peace.\r\n\r\nWhile Squire Harker was gone for his books, pen, ink, and paper, which\r\nwere concealed in a thorn-bush near the church, Lizzi sat silent in a\r\npew and wondered if the angels would make merry over a church-wedding\r\nconducted by a squire.\r\n\r\nWhen Squire Harker thought he had allowed himself time enough to get to\r\nhis office and back, he tapped at the church door. Gill shaded the\r\ncandles and called to him to enter. He closed the door and made a\r\nhat-peg of the key, the black slouch effectually preventing any peeping\r\nthrough the keyhole.\r\n\r\nHe took a position behind the table on which he had placed the candles,\r\nand Gill and Lizzi stood before it. The candles threw their weird\r\nshadows on the walls and ceiling of the low lecture-room. The shadows\r\ndeepened and faded, advanced and retreated, nodded and bowed in the\r\nuncertain light from the candles which seemed to struggle against their\r\nown consumption, yet were never quite able to master the eating fire\r\nthat at intervals flashed greedily.\r\n\r\nThe Squire took up the church book and began to read the ceremony, but\r\nLizzi stopped him.\r\n\r\n\"Not the preacher's way by a squire; take your own book.\"\r\n\r\nSo he opened a volume of legal forms and asked the question, \"Are both\r\nparties of contracting age?\"\r\n\r\nGill responded \"Yes,\" and Lizzi said she was old enough to know her own\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nThe shadows stood still.\r\n\r\n\"Is there any person here present who knows any good reason why these\r\ntwo parties shall not be united in marriage? If so, let him speak now,\r\nor forever after hold his peace.\"\r\n\r\nThe candles spluttered, the flames leaped and flashed, and the shadows\r\nnodded and bowed and nodded.\r\n\r\n\"Join your right hands.\"\r\n\r\nGill took Lizzi's hand in his, and the Squire continued the ceremony,\r\nreading the form slowly, stumbling over the big words, but at last he\r\npronounced them man and wife.\r\n\r\nThen the shadows stood solemnly still, while Gill kissed Lizzi.\r\n\r\nAfter congratulating the bride and groom, the Squire sat down to write\r\nthe marriage certificate. Gill and Lizzi retired to a window and\r\nconversed in low tones. Presently, after a long while it seemed to the\r\nflustered Squire, he handed Lizzi her marriage certificate. It was\r\nwritten on legal-cap and tied with red tape. She received it joyfully\r\nand placed it in her bosom. There it lay, the legal testimonial of her\r\npurity, the proof of her honesty, should that ever be questioned.\r\n\r\nThe Squire gathered up the things he had brought with him, blew out the\r\ncandles and left the church, going his way, while Gill and Lizzi went to\r\nher home.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nBLIND BENNER'S JEALOUSY.\r\n\r\nLanguid Indian Summer loitered among the great mountains. Her veil,\r\ncaught on the peaks, draped gracefully in the ravines and hid the\r\nvalleys beneath a gray sheen. Every evening the sun set in red wrath at\r\nthis persistent half concealment of her beauty, and the big hand he\r\nreached out above the horizon, the broad fingers stretching to the\r\nzenith, freed the winds that they might tear off the gauze. But they\r\nyielded to her charm and became her lovers, fanning her cheek so gently\r\nthat her gossamer veil was scarcely rustled. One morning she was gone,\r\nvanished with the night, and the winds dashed in furious pursuit of her.\r\nAh, the jilt! She will come again next year, and the silly winds will\r\nforget her fickleness, paying court to her, while she dreamily crosses\r\nthe mountains.\r\n\r\nOn a Sunday afternoon in this sweet after-thought summer-time, two weeks\r\nafter Lizzi's wedding, Blind Benner and Hunch were half-sitting,\r\nhalf-lying on a pile of leaves on the top of Bald Mountain. Hunch was\r\ngreatly distressed at not being able to quiet his friend's discontent,\r\nwhich was very evident as he turned his sightless eyes to the sky at one\r\nmoment, and at the next rolled over and buried his face in the leaves.\r\n\r\n\"'Tain't no use in carryin' on thet way. Lizzi ain't here, an' thet's\r\nall there is 'bout it.\"\r\n\r\n\"There ain't no comfert in her bein' away,\" Blind Benner groaned.\r\n\r\n\"It's the first time she's missed comin'; an' yer know, Benner, she's\r\nmortil fond uv yer, an' she hed good reason fer stayin' er she'd ben\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thet's more comfertin' talk, Hunch.\"\r\n\r\nIf the blind man could have seen the smile that broke out on his\r\nfriend's face at this remark, he would have been amply repaid for it.\r\nThere was moisture, too, in the dwarf's eyes. He was grateful to the\r\nfriend who had said he comforted him. For a long time Blind Benner lay\r\nface downwards in the leaves, and Hunch sat beside him in silence, his\r\nuntutored intelligence having caught the great secret of\r\nsympathy--unobtrusiveness.\r\n\r\nUntil this time Lizzi had always been their companion on these Sunday\r\njaunts, but on this day she could not be found, and the two friends had\r\ngone off in a desperate sort of way, resisting the old habit, yet unable\r\nto break it.\r\n\r\nHunch openly declared that he loved no one but Blind Benner. The dwarf\r\nwas unseemly, disagreeable. He felt that he was pitied by those who saw\r\nhis deformity, and he loathed their compassion. In this list he did not\r\ninclude Lizzi, who said a kind thing about his back, and Bill Kellar,\r\nwho was always making fun of it.\r\n\r\nLizzi once said:\r\n\r\n\"Hunch, don't mind about your back. You're so good to Blind Benner, that\r\nI know you're an angel, and the hump on your back is only your wings\r\nfolded up.\"\r\n\r\nHe ever afterwards remembered her fondly, but he had no love for anyone\r\nexcept Blind Benner, who did not know how hideous among men the dwarf\r\nwas.\r\n\r\nBlind Benner's affection for Lizzi was the love of a mature man for the\r\nwoman who alone has been able to work upon his heart the spell that\r\nenthralls it forever, yet it had no hope, and his only longing was to be\r\nnear her, to hear her voice, sometimes to have her hand in his. A new\r\nelement, one of pain, had entered into his life, and he groaned, for he\r\nwas jealous and helpless. He had some way divined Lizzi's love for Gill,\r\nand the knowledge had revealed to him the nature of his own affection\r\nfor the woman whom he never dared tell that he, the blind man, loved her\r\nwith the love that would make her his wife. He lay fighting the new\r\npain, and Haunch sat near him, ready with help such as he could give if\r\nit was asked for.\r\n\r\nAt last Blind Benner said:\r\n\r\n\"Hunch, do yer mind the time Lizzi told me what she looked like?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mind ev'ry bit she said.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me it all over.\"\r\n\r\n\"She sed she wuz taller'n yer, Benner; and yer know'd thet. She told yer\r\nshe hed a good figger; and there ain't no better in the mountins.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jist tell what _she_ sed, Hunch.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right. She sed she wuz strong, an' could carry yer easy as a baby,\r\nan' could chop wood like a man; her daddy learned her how ter handle the\r\naxe, an' Levi learned her spellin' an' grammer.\"\r\n\r\n\"She talks mighty pretty, don't she, Hunch?\" Blind Benner interrupted.\r\n\r\n\"Ain't no better talker, nowheres. An' her hands wuz perfect, she sed,\r\non'y they wuz red from soapsuds, an' _they_ didn't wear off in a week.\r\nHer hands wuz whitest Sundays.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! I mind how she laid one on my head when she sed thet,\" Benner again\r\ninterrupted, \"an' I sed it wuz yeller in feelin'; an' she wanted ter\r\nknow why, an' I sed 'cause it felt warm an' soft like the sunlight, an'\r\nthey say thet's yeller.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, an' I sed the furnace fire was red; but yer got techy an' sed thet\r\nwuz hot. Do yer mind thet, Benner--hot and scorchin', not soft an' warm?\r\nAn' then when yer thought yer bed spoke too sharp ter me, yer made up\r\nfer it by sayin' colors wuz hard fer yer ter make out, jist as if a\r\nlittle thing like thet'd make me mad at yer, Benner.\"\r\n\r\n\"I ain't got no business speakin' sharp ter yer, Hunch, what's so kind\r\nter me allers,\" and Blind Benner laid his head on his friend's knee.\r\n\"Thet wuzn't all she sed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nuh! she sed her feet wuz big.\"\r\n\r\n\"An' yer sed thet didn't make no diff'rence, fer her skirts hid 'em,\"\r\nand Blind Benner laughed. \"But tell me what she sed 'bout her face.\"\r\n\r\n\"She sed it wuzn't very purty, an' wuz big an' round, an' almost filled\r\nup the lookin'-glass; thet Levi sed it wuz allers full moon at their\r\nhouse, fer her face wuz allers shinin' with good-natur'.\"\r\n\r\n\"An' I mind I sed it must be allers, fer her voice wuz allers glad an'\r\nsweet, sweeter'n a fiddle when Bill Kellar plays it.\"\r\n\r\n\"An' yer mind she sed her eyes wuz black, Benner, an' yer asked if they\r\nwuz purty, an' I sed 'mighty'; an' yer sed the 'dark is black, an' it\r\nwuzn't so bad ter live in the dark after all'?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I mind it, Hunch; but her eyes don't shine inter this dark;\" and\r\nthe blind man struck his chest, while a scowl passed over his face.\r\n\r\nHunch did not reply, and there was a moment of silence, broken by\r\nBenner, who said fiercely:\r\n\r\n\"Ef I hed the use uv my eyes, Gill wouldn't git her; I'd cut him out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ef it would help yer, Benner, I'd cut his eyes out, an' take the\r\nchances uv gittin' away,\" Hunch said in a low, determined tone.\r\n\r\nBlind Benner smiled and replied:\r\n\r\n\"No, thet wouldn't do no good. It would on'y put the light out uv\r\nLizzi's heart an' make her blinder'n me. No, there ain't no hope fer me.\r\nGill's goin' ter git her because I can't ask fer her. But he'll never\r\nlove her no more'n I do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Benner,\" said Hunch, cheerfully, \"mebbe yer kin hev yer eyes fixed.\r\nI've got some money, saved it, an' I'll give it ter yer, ev'ry cent: an'\r\nwhen yer well, yer kin pay me back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yer mighty kind, Hunch,\" Blind Benner said, putting his arm around the\r\ndwarf's neck, \"but there ain't no cure fer me. I've jist got to go 'long\r\ngropin' an' wishin' I'd hed eyes like Gill's.\"\r\n\r\n\"There ain't no tellin'. Do yer know, Benner, I wuz layin' in bed\r\nth'other night, an' I thought the wall wuz lookin' at me, with a great\r\nbig eye. I ain't easy skeered, yer know, an' I set up ter git a better\r\nlook, an' what do you think it wuz? The lookin'-glass hangin' there; an'\r\nthinks I, mebbe ef Benner hed lookin'-glasses in his eyes, he could see\r\ntoo. Let's try to get them put in, Benner. Twon't cost much.\" The dwarf\r\nspoke very earnestly, and a moisture filled his friend's eyes.\r\n\r\n\"'Tain't no use, Hunch; there wuz a doctor in the city where Bill Kellar\r\ncome from, thet sed I wuz stone-blind; an' couldn't never see. My daddy\r\ntook me ter him long 'fore I knowed yer. Anyhow, Hunch, how yer goin'\r\nter git lookin'-glasses inter a feller's head.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I think yer kin, an' I'm goin' ter ask Bill Kellar. What he don't\r\nknow's hard ter find out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, Hunch, let's go ter the Block, mebbe Lizzi'll be there. 'Tain't\r\nnice up here without her, an' I ain't comin' no more, 'less she's\r\nalong.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ain't yer tired, Benner?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I am, Hunch. Tireder then I've ever ben in my life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Git on my back an' I'll carry yer.\"\r\n\r\n\"I ain't tired in my legs, Hunch. I kin walk.\"\r\n\r\nTaking Blind Benner's hand, Hunch led him down into the deepening shadow\r\nof the valley.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nBILL KELLAR.\r\n\r\n\"He is coaxing again, that violin-loving devil.\"\r\n\r\nNew Year's Eve had come, and Bill Kellar sat before a log-fire in his\r\nsitting-room, glad that he had given his violin into Lizzi's charge the\r\nnight of her birthday ball. Since then he had not seen it, though his\r\nfingers had often itched for the strings, and his arm longed for the\r\nbow.\r\n\r\n\"He is there, the red salamander; and already his tempting has ceased.\r\nNow he commands. Soon he will threaten. Well, let him; I will not give\r\nup this time.\"\r\n\r\nBill looked resolutely into the fire, as if resolved to stare the\r\ntempter out of countenance. He ran his thin hand through his long hair,\r\nand seemed quite satisfied with his powers of resistance.\r\n\r\n\"Lord! what is that?\" he cried suddenly, and started to his feet. For a\r\nwhile he was motionless, gazing at the flames leaping up the chimney.\r\nPresently he muttered, \"Sure as I live, the devil wears a mask, and a\r\nqueer one. The eyes are curiously long with curving corners, and set up\r\nand down in his face. The nose is long, with a high bridge. The chin is\r\nturned up, and has fiddle-screws through it. The devil holds a\r\nviolin-bow in one hand, and in the other a scourge of fiddle-strings.\r\nSomething has happened to my fiddle, my dear old violin.\"\r\n\r\nHe covered his face with his hands, and wept convulsively.\r\n\r\n\"I thought my fiddle would be as safe in Lizzi's keeping as her honor.\"\r\n\r\nHis clock struck ten.\r\n\r\n\"I will have to go.\" The resolution formed, he removed his hands from\r\nhis face, and dried his tears on a bandanna handkerchief. Then he\r\ncontinued the soliloquy.\r\n\r\n\"I meant to fight it out this time, and let Satan go without his New\r\nYear's dance. I could have sat here until morning and shaken with\r\nchills-and-fever until my teeth dropped out; but I can't stand this\r\nuncertainty about the fate of my violin. This suspense would make me\r\nmad--madder far than the noises of the city would have done; madder than\r\ncrazy Lear; crazier far than that lunatic Bill Kellar has ever been.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you soul-thief, redder than the flames around you. I will go to\r\nsee the waif, my child that I abandoned for fear of you and your\r\nshivers; and if it is well with the darling, you know you will get your\r\nannual Harvest dance. For I must needs caress the baby, and to the music\r\nof its glad laugh you will kick your cloven hoof, you superannuated old\r\nfiend. What have I done that you must select me for your soloist on the\r\nviolin?\"\r\n\r\nAs he talked, Bill looked steadily at the flames as if at the face of a\r\nperson. When he had thus relieved his mind he took down his heavy coat,\r\nand nervously buttoned it round him. Snatching his hat, he jammed it\r\nover his eyes and opened the door. With one hand on the latch, he turned\r\nand glanced over his shoulder. The apparition had vanished.\r\n\r\n\"The devil is mighty eager for a dance, else my old eyes have been\r\nmaking a fool of me.\"\r\n\r\nLeaving the door wide open, he returned to the fireplace. He waited a\r\nwhile, but did not see the face in the fire.\r\n\r\nWith a glad shout he suddenly ran to the door, and slammed it shut.\r\n\r\n\"I'm free, free!\" he cried, clapping his hands gleefully.\r\n\r\nHanging his coat and hat on their pegs, he sat down before the fire, and\r\ncongratulated himself on his liberty. But his cheerful mood did not last\r\nlong. Soon he began to shiver, and in the fire beheld the devil return.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Lord! he is back. I am still his slave. He has not removed the\r\nviolin-mask. Yes, yes, I go to my child.\"\r\n\r\nBareheaded he plunged into the cold, which he did not mind, and the\r\ndarkness, which he did not heed, for his way was marked by the light of\r\nthe Three-Sister furnaces, reflected by the clouds.\r\n\r\nLizzi was at the window, listening to the gunshots--the farewell volleys\r\nto the old year, the welcoming salute to the new--when a cold, nervous\r\nhand was laid on her shoulder. She had not heard the door open, but as\r\nit was like any one of the boys to steal up behind her and say something\r\nhumorous in her ear she sat still, and continued to watch for the\r\nflashes of the guns.\r\n\r\n\"Lizzi, what has happened to my fiddle?\"\r\n\r\nRecognizing Bill Kellar's voice, harsh as it was, she caught his hand in\r\na hard grip and turned, not knowing whether she would face a lunatic or\r\na drunken man, but afraid of neither.\r\n\r\nHe was not intoxicated nor seemingly crazy, only intensely eager. His\r\neyes were not wild, but pathetically pleading as they met hers.\r\n\r\n\"Nothin', Bill,\" she replied gently. \"It's just as you left it. I keep\r\nit in the cupboard, and Blind Benner dusts it often.\"\r\n\r\nHis fast walk, which had been a sort of run over the frozen road, had\r\nworn Bill out, and he almost swooned with joy when he heard the good\r\nnews. As he gasped for breath his body swayed, and he would have fallen\r\nhad she not supported him with her free hand--he still clung to the\r\nother--and helped him to a chair. While she stood beside him he kissed\r\nher hand frequently as he silently wept. She did not take it away nor\r\nforbid him to caress it. Understanding his emotion, she allowed it to\r\nexpress itself in the way it chose.\r\n\r\nPresently he became less demonstrative and said:\r\n\r\n\"Now please give me the fiddle, Lizzi.\"\r\n\r\nShe opened the cupboard, and handed him the box. He was so nervous that\r\nhe could not fit the key in the lock, and Lizzi did it for him. When the\r\nlock sprung open he eagerly raised the lid, and there lay, bright and\r\nunharmed, the violin that he loved as his life.\r\n\r\n\"The red devil wore that lying mask and forced me to come. He knew\r\nchills-and-fever had about lost their terrors for me, so instead of\r\ntrying to force me that way, he threw me into an agony of suspense that\r\ndrove me here. Very well, King of Liars, your dance this time will be\r\nshort. Bill Kellar's nerves are too shaky and his brain too tired to\r\nfiddle long for you to-night.\"\r\n\r\nWhile he talked he tuned the violin. When it was in chord he began\r\nplaying a slow improvisation that calmed and rested him, but must have\r\nmade Satan angry, judging from the sarcastic smile that settled on the\r\nfiddler's face.\r\n\r\nHe had not played longer than ten minutes when Blind Benner entered, and\r\nsat down at Lizzi's feet.\r\n\r\nSoon the spirit of the violin began to gain the mastery, and Bill's\r\nplaying became more rapid, his execution more emphatic. Then Blind\r\nBenner knew that the demon of the music had woven its spell over his\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\nRising, Blind Benner groped his way to the door and went out. Lizzi was\r\nrather lethargic, not fully sympathizing with the violinist, yet\r\ngradually yielding to the fascination of the music. Soon Benner came\r\nback, with Hunch, who had his cornet. Bill's gleaming eyes caught sight\r\nof it, and he rose, stamping his foot and shaking his head. Hunch gave\r\nhim a look of inquiry, and held up the horn.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; don't blow it to-night, for I've got Old Nick in my power, and he\r\nmust dance until I fall senseless, unable to play longer.\"\r\n\r\nHunch laid the horn on the table, and settled himself to see the end of\r\nthe violinist's madness. Blind Benner stood reverently near his maestro,\r\nwhile Lizzi tried to hear the devil's hoof on the snow-covered roof.\r\n\r\nFuriously Bill played out the old year, and in the new. Guns were\r\npopping all around in the semi-darkness. The horn and the goblin were\r\nsilent. They had the power to break the spell of the music.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the music ceased. Hunch caught the violin, and Lizzi seized in\r\nher strong arms the falling player, who otherwise would have struck his\r\nhead on the bare floor as he sank into unconsciousness.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nFIRE.\r\n\r\nThe snow was deep in the forest. It upholstered the gaunt branches of\r\nthe giant trees; it clung tenaciously to the leafless twigs; it\r\nencrusted the millions of pine needles; it covered the rough\r\nmountain-sides: it piled up its crystals in the deep ravines, where the\r\ndeer hid; it lay like a warm blanket over the wheat; it spread all over\r\nthe land, a great white silence, through which the river and creek,\r\nspellbound, flowed without a murmur.\r\n\r\nThus it had lain for three months--December, January, February. The\r\nclouds, jealous of the sun and proud of their artistic skill in\r\nsoftening the face of Nature, grim and gaunt in her winter's sleep, came\r\nalmost daily and sifted fresh snow upon that already fallen, which the\r\nwinds and sun were in alliance to disfigure and soil.\r\n\r\nMarch had just come. Each day the sun rose more confident of victory.\r\nEre long he would succeed in making Nature look like an old wanton, her\r\npowdered face tear-streaked and unsightly.\r\n\r\nOn the last night of February the clock in Lizzi's room made one quick\r\nguess at the time, and brought her back from a flight of fancy. She was\r\nstartled to see that it was one o'clock, and resumed the sewing that had\r\nlain neglected in her lap, while her thoughts roved.\r\n\r\nShe was sewing in secret, with the blind of the window down and her\r\ncandle shaded. The garment she was fashioning was one of those almost\r\nshapeless infant robes that the inventive skill of dawning motherhood\r\nmakes so diversely pretty and daintily ungraceful. She had begun to fold\r\na plait in it, and paused to debate with herself on the size of the\r\nfold.\r\n\r\n\"If I was sure it would be a boy I'd make these pleats wider,\" she\r\nmurmured.\r\n\r\nFrom that her thoughts had wandered until she was recalled to her work\r\nby the striking of the clock. For another hour she worked diligently,\r\nthen arose and put the sewing away where her mother would not be likely\r\nto find it. After that she blew out the candle and raised the blind for\r\na last look that night at the store. The moonlight streamed into the\r\nwindow, dazzling her eyes accustomed to the candle-light. She shut them\r\nquickly in pain, and when she opened them a thrill of terror passed over\r\nher.\r\n\r\nShe saw a great column of smoke rising from the roof of the store, and a\r\nlittle flame leaping up through it.\r\n\r\nThe next moment, an axe in her hand, she was on the street.\r\n\r\n\"Fire! Fire! The store's on fire!\"\r\n\r\nHer clear voice rang wild and sharp on the still night air. The echoes\r\nmocked her.\r\n\r\n\"Colonel Hornberger, get up!\"\r\n\r\nWith her axe's handle she rattled fierce blows on the front door of the\r\nproprietor's house.\r\n\r\n\"Help! Help!\"\r\n\r\nThe echoes hurled back her voice mockingly:\r\n\r\n\"Help! ha, ha!\"\r\n\r\n\"He is dead,\" she thought, \"and the echoes are making fun of me.\"\r\n\r\nCry after cry she uttered in her anguish, fierce alarm-notes that\r\naroused the heavy sleepers and brought them to the windows, only to\r\nhastily throw on some clothes and rush to the rescue, for they all knew\r\nthat Gill slept in the store and even then might be dead.\r\n\r\nOh! Lizzi's strength! No longer screaming in terror, no more exhausting\r\nher breath by calling for help, she dealt mighty blows with the axe\r\nagainst the door of the office, above which her husband slept. Giant\r\nstrokes, rapid, unerring, concentrated, made effective by the skill of a\r\nwoodman, the strength of despair and the agony of love. Against them the\r\ndoor could not stand. It fell in, cut off its hinges. A great volume of\r\nsmoke rolled out and beat her back.\r\n\r\nA closed door separated the office from the store and was a barrier to\r\nthe flames which were raging in the store-room.\r\n\r\nDrawing a full breath and bowing low, Lizzi plunged into the office and\r\nreached the stair door. Well she knew the way. The door was closed, and\r\nshe was so unnerved with joy that for a moment she clung to the latch\r\nand listened to the flames roaring in the store. She could see them\r\nthrough the window which give light from the office to the rear of the\r\nstore, and they fascinated her. The heat cracked the glass in the\r\nwindow, and a tongue of flame leaped towards the opening made by a\r\nfalling pane.\r\n\r\nThis recalled Lizzi to a sense of the danger and the need for urgent\r\naction. She jerked the door open, breaking the latch, and sped up the\r\nstairs, chased by a volume of smoke. To her horror it filled the room,\r\nelse it was in her eyes. Thank God! she had brought the axe. Staggering\r\nto the windows, she smashed them both and knocked the shutters open,\r\ngiving vent to the smoke.\r\n\r\nShe could not see Gill, but she knew just where he lay. With an effort\r\nshe reached the bed. Her mouth was firmly closed, but her strength was\r\nalmost gone Her trembling hands touched him. He was motionless.\r\n\r\nThen when her heart had almost stopped and she was falling in a swoon,\r\nthe flames burst into the room, lighting up Gill's face upturned and\r\nwhite. Uttering a scream, she caught him up in her arms, became strong\r\nagain in desperation, and leaped recklessly down the stairs. Tottering\r\nwith her burden into the street; she sank unconscious at the feet of\r\nCassi, who, hearing her cries, had come running, the first to answer her\r\ncall.\r\n\r\nThere had not been so much smoke in Gill's room as Lizzi had imagined,\r\nand he soon recovered consciousness in the cold air.\r\n\r\nThere was no hope for the store, and no one remembered the office books.\r\nA little presence of mind and prompt action on the part of first-comers\r\nmight have saved them, but every one was so excited over Lizzi's daring\r\nand remarkable strength in saving Gill from a horrible death that all\r\nelse was forgotten. Some ran for the doctor and others tried to restore\r\nher to consciousness, Colonel Hornberger encouraging them.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind the store,\" he exclaimed. \"The fire is only making away with\r\nthe old stock and giving Gill and me an excuse for a trip to the city.\r\nBut save that brave girl if possible.\"\r\n\r\nHe tore off his coat and threw it over Lizzi, who lay on an improvised\r\ncouch of store boxes, hastily placed together by willing hands.\r\n\r\n\"Heavens, what a woman!\"\r\n\r\nHe uttered the words impulsively as he gazed admiringly upon her.\r\n\r\nOther men followed his example, and they stood shivering, while their\r\ncoats covered Lizzi.\r\n\r\nShe lay still. The weird red light of the roaring flames could not even\r\ntint her face, so white and cold it was.\r\n\r\nOver her bent the man whose life she had saved. His face was firm, his\r\neyes were dry, his pulse was steady. His only speech, a question spoken\r\nin a low tone, sent a thrill through the crowd, in which were now a\r\nnumber of women.\r\n\r\n\"Will the doctor never come?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nCoatless and inefficient, the men stood at a respectful distance from\r\nLizzi, over whom Cassi bent, speaking to her in fond tones, and their\r\nstern silence checked the gabble of the women, who knew not what to do\r\nto restore her to life, but had suggested many things that night avail.\r\n\r\nA shriek, the quavering cry of old age, nor piercing, but heart-rending,\r\nbroke from the lips of Lizzi's mother, as half clad, she pushed feebly\r\nher way through the yielding crowd and fell across her daughter's body.\r\n\r\nColonel Hornberger put his arm around her and lifted her away from the\r\nboxes.\r\n\r\n\"Here, Gret Reed, you take charge of Mrs. McAnay. Go with her to my\r\nhouse.\"\r\n\r\nGret obeyed the excited proprietor, and as she supported the moaning\r\nwoman along the street they met Hunch leading Blind Benner.\r\n\r\n\"She's dead!\" Mrs. McAnay exclaimed. \"My Lizzi's dead! my Lizzi's dead!\r\nOh! oh!\"\r\n\r\nBlind Benner heard her and stopped. \"Take me away, Hunch,\" he pleaded,\r\n\"take me away.\"\r\n\r\nHunch turned towards the Block. Tears streamed from the blind man's\r\neyes, and sobs choked him. After going a few steps he halted and faced\r\nthe fire. Hunch, obedient to his every wish, let go the hand he shook as\r\nif to free it. They were near the fire, and its heat burned Blind\r\nBenner's face. Hunch stood with his back to it, watching its light on\r\nthe snow-covered mountain.\r\n\r\nA quick movement on the part of Bind Benner attracted his attention. He\r\nturned around and saw the blind man running straight to the fire.\r\nShouting to him to stop, Hunch started after him, but he was running\r\nswiftly without stumbling, and there seemed small hope of catching him.\r\n\r\nGret looked over her shoulder on hearing Hunch's cries, and saw that\r\nBlind Benner meant to commit suicide. Clear as a bell her voice rang out\r\nin the only lie she ever told.\r\n\r\n\"Benner, you have passed the fire; turn back.\"\r\n\r\nThe doubt she raised checked him for only a moment, but long enough to\r\nbring Hunch upon him. In a twinkling his feet were knocked from under\r\nhim and Hunch sat upon his prostrate form.\r\n\r\nThe messenger who had been sent for the doctor brought back word that he\r\nhad not returned from a late call up Boomer Creek.\r\n\r\n\"My God, she will die!\" Gill groaned, \"and for me!\"\r\n\r\nHis words scored sympathizing hearts and indented faithful memories.\r\n\r\nThe store building was dry as tinder and burned very rapidly. The roof\r\nhad fallen in before Gill recovered consciousness, and soon after the\r\nwalls toppled into the cellar.\r\n\r\nThe news of the doctor's absence sent a pang to the hearts of all, and\r\nhope for Lizzi was abandoned, she being beyond the restorative power of\r\nthe water which had been dashed in her face.\r\n\r\nA hastily constructed stretcher, made of two benches from the tavern\r\nfastened together, was brought, and Lizzi's limp form was laid upon it.\r\nCoats were her mattress, and coats her covering. Four strong men lifted\r\nthe stretcher and headed the procession, which filed silently around the\r\nrapidly lessening blare. Gill and Cassi came next, walking arm in arm,\r\nthe former wearing a coat that a brawny man had thrown over his\r\nshivering shoulders.\r\n\r\nWhen the column came to where the front entrance of the store had been,\r\nHunch and Blind Benner were struggling in the water made by the snow\r\nmelting in the heat of the fire. \"What's this?\" sternly demanded Colonel\r\nHornberger, who broke into a laugh before he received an answer. The\r\nfire excitement was still working in him.\r\n\r\n\"He tried ter burn hisself an' I wouldn't let him,\" Hunch replied.\r\n\r\n\"What did he want to do that for?\" asked the Colonel.\r\n\r\n\"Cause Lizzi's dead.\"\r\n\r\nThus was told in simple words to the people of Three Sisters what Lizzi\r\nherself had not known, that Blind Benner loved her.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously with this disclosure came the sound of a horse galloping\r\nover the Boomer Creek bridge. The horse came rapidly nearer, and soon\r\nhis hoofs resounded from the long bridge that spanned the river.\r\n\r\nIt was a wild gallop, yet the horse ran as if some one sat him urging\r\nhim on.\r\n\r\n\"The doctor,\" surmised every one, and the procession halted. Hunch\r\nvoiced the general guess to Blind Benner, whom he yet held on the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n\"The doctor's comin'. He'll bring Lizzi back ter life, see if he don't,\r\nBenner.\"\r\n\r\nThe blind man ceased struggling, and Hunch let him get on his feet, but\r\nwatched him warily.\r\n\r\nA shout of glad welcome greeted the familiar roan that \"saddle-bags,\" as\r\nthe Three-Sisters folk would call their physician, always rode when\r\nvisiting distant patients or in response to urgent calls. The men who\r\nbore the stretcher set it down, in readiness for Dr. Barnes, as he\r\nreined his horse in the midst of the crowd of men and women who pressed\r\ndangerously near the excited animal. Strong hands seized the bridle and\r\nmuscular arms almost pulled the physician from the saddle, while Colonel\r\nHornberger graphically narrated the story of Gill's rescue and told of\r\nLizzi's swoon which was like death.\r\n\r\n\"She's choked with the smoke, Lizzi is, and don't come to,\" said Cassi,\r\npiteously.\r\n\r\nGarrulous women pushed forward to furnish the doctor with details of the\r\nrescue and praise Lizzi, but he would not listen to them. He pressed his\r\near to Lizzi's bosom and silence fell on the spectators. He raised his\r\nhead, and they, eager, expectant, saw no encouragement in his face. From\r\nhis pocket he produced a small mirror and wiped it dry with a silk\r\nhandkerchief. He held it a moment over Lizzi's mouth and smiled.\r\n\r\nThe air quivered with shouts, the boisterous hurrahs of the men, the\r\nshrill huzzas of the women.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nA LETTER FROM GILL'S MOTHER.\r\n\r\nLizzi recovered soon after she was placed in her bed. Gret Reed had\r\naided the physician, and was the first person Lizzi saw when her eyes\r\ndreamily opened. They closed again at once, for from downstairs Gill's\r\nvoice reached her ears, and she knew he was safe. She was ill (she would\r\nlaugh at the word) but a day.\r\n\r\nWhen the excitement over her had subsided, wondering inquiries as to the\r\norigin of the fire began to be voiced. Gill was called to account for\r\ngoing to bed with his clothes on.\r\n\r\n\"I was working late at the books,\" he said, \"it being the end of the\r\nmonth, and I got so sleepy and tired that I just pulled off my coat and\r\nthrew myself on the bed and fell asleep.\"\r\n\r\nColonel Hornberger believed him, and no one had reason to suspect him.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the fire remained a mystery, but the loss occasioned by\r\nthe destruction of the store was severe upon the Three Sisters people.\r\nColonel Hornberger set out at once for the city to buy a new stock,\r\nfirst making arrangements with the proprietors of the nearest store to\r\nsupply his employés with necessities. The Colonel took Gill with him.\r\n\r\nBefore departing, the latter called upon Lizzi and, in the presence of\r\nher family, feelingly expressed his gratitude for the heroic rescue of\r\nhis unworthy life. He depreciated himself modestly, and the McAnays\r\nthought him very unassuming. Lizzi put up her hand in glad protest as\r\nshe heard his graceful sentences, conveying to her a deeper meaning than\r\nthankfulness.\r\n\r\n\"When I come back,\" was their promise, \"then,\" they said to her, \"I\r\nshall acknowledge you as my wife, Lizzi.\"\r\n\r\nThe Colonel was expeditious, and soon returned with a large stock of\r\ngoods, some of which were stored in the warehouse at the station; the\r\nbalance was placed upon the shelves of the temporary building that had\r\nbeen erected in his absence. For a few days Gill was very busy, and his\r\nvisits to Lizzi were only short calls.\r\n\r\nOne evening he came early, evidently with the intention of making a\r\nvisit. Soon he and Lizzi were left alone together.\r\n\r\n\"I have had a letter from mother, Lizzi,\" Gill said eagerly, but his\r\ntone was not loud. \"Such a letter about you and the fire, and I am sure\r\nall I have to do is to go and see her, and she will be only too glad to\r\nreceive you as her daughter.\"\r\n\r\nLizzi stood still. Her heart beat so hard she thought it would burst,\r\nand the color deepened on her cheek. She had few tricks. Her honest\r\nnature expressed itself simply. She was glad, and her face and posture\r\nwere the manifestations of her joy. She was one of the few persons with\r\nwhom words at times have too deep meaning to be uttered, and whose\r\nactions are the sole exponents of their feeling.\r\n\r\nGill said quietly:\r\n\r\n\"Sit down, dear, and I will read you the letter.\"\r\n\r\nBut she could not do so without giving vent to her feelings, which she\r\ndid in the very undramatic act of poking the fire. She did it\r\nvigorously, and the click of the metal stove doors as she closed them\r\nwas a \"There now\" to her mood. Then she sat down ready to listen. He\r\nbegan at once.\r\n\r\n\"'My dear son, doubly precious to me because of your nearness to a\r\nhorrible death, give my love to the brave girl who saved you to me. Some\r\nday she may know from the anguish of her own heart over a child's peril\r\nhow much I mean when I say I am grateful to her. Words cannot be\r\nstronger than that. If she is ever a mother, she will learn that it is\r\nthe parent's love alone that endures in all its sensitiveness.\r\n\r\n\"'But I am jealous, weakly, selfishly jealous of the grand girl of whom\r\nyou write so admiringly. It seems to me I detect in your sentences the\r\nevidence that she has dethroned me in your heart, where until now I\r\nflatter myself I have been first.\r\n\r\n\"'You say she is beautiful, womanly; that her great physical strength\r\ndoes not detract from her femininity; that she is always a modest,\r\ngentle woman. I am glad to know it, and if you love her I cannot be so\r\ncruel as to execute the threat I wrote so fiercely some time ago, when I\r\nguessed you were losing your heart. I guess again, John: Lizzi is the\r\nwoman you wrote of then. But come home; come and tell me about her who\r\nhas saved your life, and against whom I have not the heart to hurl my\r\nformer threat.\r\n\r\n  YOUR FOND MOTHER.'\"\r\n\r\nLizzi took the letter and looked at it. The beautiful, clear writing was\r\nthe same as that of the other letter, which had led to her secret\r\nmarriage. Now the obstacles to the acknowledgment of that ceremony were,\r\nor soon would be, removed. She clasped her hands, enfolding in them the\r\nletter, and sat still, listening to her heart beating a reveillé for the\r\nsunrise of certainty. She had been living in the night of doubt. She had\r\nbeen afraid of this formidable mother, who wrote so beautifully and\r\ncoldly, but now this fear was banished, and love, reciprocally grateful,\r\ntook its place. Her heart went out to the fond, yet jealous, mother who\r\nhad written so yieldingly of her. This mother had clung so determinedly\r\nto her son, but now she loosed her grasp on him that he might tend\r\nwhither he would, because his way led to her, Lizzi.\r\n\r\nShe was flattered by the manner in which Gill had written to his mother\r\nof her. \"For,\" she reasoned, \"a man will be honest with his mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go, John,\" she said simply. \"Your mother should know before the world\r\ndoes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think it best, Lizzi. I shall come back in two weeks unless something\r\nhappens to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't say that, John, or you can't go. If anything should happen to\r\nyou, death would happen to me.\"\r\n\r\nShe kissed him. Her kiss was fire to his blood. He caught her in a\r\npassionate embrace. His lack of reverence wounded her. She shrank from\r\nhis touch, which for the first time seemed coarse. Instinctively he\r\nunderstood and released her.\r\n\r\nThe next day he departed for his mother's residence.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nBLIND BENNER'S TRIBUTE.\r\n\r\nThe two weeks of Gill's absence ran into six and he had not come back.\r\nLizzi wrote to the address he gave, and the letter was returned to her.\r\nGossip said he had deserted her, but she said to her broken heart, \"John\r\nis dead.\"\r\n\r\nShe recalled his fond good-by and his promise to return, with or without\r\nhis mother's approval of his marriage, at the end of two weeks. She\r\nremembered his cavalier appearance as he rode by the Block and waved her\r\na farewell. She heard still the sound of his horse's hoofs in the long\r\nbridge. She knew he had considerable money on his person, and supposed\r\nsome one had murdered him for it. She was left a widow, indeed.\r\n\r\nYet she held her peace and bore herself proudly as ever. Her eyes did\r\nnot quail before the cold stare of the matrons. Her honest heart\r\nsustained her. It did not cry out, \"Shame! shame!\" So she did not\r\nseclude herself, nor was she forward. When necessity called her into the\r\nstreets, she courageously faced her old acquaintances and bore with\r\npatience their scorn. Two women were kind to her and sad for her, but\r\nwere not oppressive in their attentions. These were Mrs. Hornberger and\r\nGret Reed. Yet she did not seek the comfort of their sympathy, nor once\r\nbecome weak enough to ask them to believe in her. Appearances were\r\nagainst her, but she never intimated that she could produce legal proof\r\nof her innocence. Her heart cried out in woe, \"I am bereft,\" and there\r\nwas no solace for her, grieving for her dead husband. She could not\r\nweep, because the tears would be misconstrued.\r\n\r\nHer father's kind words had been a great support to her.\r\n\r\n\"Ye may have gone wrong, Lizzi, but I'll ne'er believe it till ye tell\r\nit me.\"\r\n\r\nThe deep tenderness of his tones had touched her where the tears lay,\r\nand they rose, overflowing the obstruction her will had built against\r\ntheir flood. She fell at his feet. It was Saturday night, and he sat in\r\nhis split-bottomed chair, resting. She laid her head on his knee, and\r\nsobbed and wept convulsively. His shaking hand stroked caressingly her\r\nsoft black hair, and he murmured low lullaby words as if soothing a\r\nchild. His conviction had been unhesitatingly expressed, but his\r\nsympathy could not find suitable language except in a song that was used\r\nto hush a crying infant.\r\n\r\nHe was seventy years old. His hair and beard were pure white. His broad\r\nchest and square shoulders told the story of his vigorous age. It was\r\nnot to frown that he contracted his eyebrows, but to narrow his vision,\r\nwhile he fixed a gentle look on his daughter, for whom his heart ached,\r\nbut in whom he believed. No, he did not frown on her. He never did\r\nshadow her babyhood, her childhood, her dawning womanhood, nor now would\r\nhe her approaching motherhood, by scowl of his. He sat bowing above his\r\ndaughter, not casting a stone at her, but quivering over her head a\r\nblessing of trust.\r\n\r\nHis wife tottered down the stairs, and Lizzi made a movement as if to\r\narise, but he kept her at his knee.\r\n\r\nMrs. McAnay was not a hard woman, but she had to the full measure her\r\nsex's vindictiveness against the woman who is weak and it was difficult\r\nfor her not to relieve her mind of what she considered its just\r\nsentiments towards her daughter. Yet she pitied Lizzi. She stopped at\r\nthe foot of the stairs and gazed wonderingly at the father and daughter.\r\nPeter did not speak and Lizzi remained on her knees. Mrs. McAnay slowly\r\napproached her child and bent over her.\r\n\r\n\"I am glad yer confessin', girl,\" she said in a weak, quavering voice.\r\n\r\nLizzi shivered. Her mother's hand resting on her head was not cold, but\r\nthe knowledge that she yet withheld from her parents what they should\r\nknow sent a chill to her heart.\r\n\r\n\"Tain't that yet, mother,\" said Peter, \"for I'm thinkin' she ain't got\r\nanything to confess that's wrong. I was sayin' something to her that\r\nmade her cry, that's all.\"\r\n\r\nThe door opened, and Levi and Matthi entered. Lizzi had not yet risen,\r\nand her mother stood over her.\r\n\r\nThe boys stopped at the door, and would have gone out again had not\r\ntheir father bade them stay. They knew no law higher than obedience to\r\ntheir venerable father. So they remained, awkwardly seating themselves,\r\nwhile Lizzi rose to her feet and buried her tear-stained face in her\r\nhands. An embarrassing silence fell on the group. It was broken by the\r\nentrance of Cassi and Blind Benner. Cassi saw at a glance that a family\r\nscene was in progress, and he started to escort Blind Benner to the\r\ndoor, but Peter said he was welcome. Cassi seated Benner, and then\r\nleaned against the wall.\r\n\r\n\"Boys!\"\r\n\r\nPeter had risen, and at the sound of his voice addressing them Levi and\r\nMatthi stood up, and Cassi took a step from the wall. \"Boys, I've been\r\ntellin' yer sister that I don't believe she has gone wrong, and I want\r\nto know if you think as I do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nA volley of affirmation, a single unflagging response, which Lizzi\r\nechoed by a sob, and their mother heard with pride, but still she\r\ndoubted. She went from one son to the other, kissing each in turn, yet\r\nshe doubted her daughter.\r\n\r\nBlind Benner had groped his way to Lizzi, and caught her right hand just\r\nas it was going to produce her marriage certificate.\r\n\r\n\"Listen!\" he said as he held her hand in both of his. \"Listen an' I'll\r\ntell yer all 'bout Lizzi.\"\r\n\r\nAn expectant hush fell upon the group, and even Lizzi's thumping heart\r\nbeat more softly as she awaited her blind friend's story.\r\n\r\n\"My eyes are only a joke.\" He spoke like a wise cynic. \"They don't see.\r\nHunch says they look like good eyes an' move an' wink like other\r\npeople's. 'Tain't no use their winkin', 'cause the light don't hurt\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nVery bitterly he spoke the last sentence as he winked his eyes\r\nsarcastically.\r\n\r\n\"But my ears, they're good; they know.\" His tone became more cheerful,\r\nbut no less earnest. \"They hear well, better than you folks see. They\r\nknow when the birds laugh and when they cry, when they're glad and when\r\nthey're sad. They know when the fiddle's in tune. They know a right\r\nsound. No, I've no eyes to see the white snow, er the blue sky, er the\r\ngreen grass; but my ears hears the wind in the trees, and it never lies\r\nter me. I know when it's mad, when it's sad, when it's glad. So is\r\nLizzi's voice ter me, like the wind among the trees that never lies ter\r\nme. I hev never seen Lizzi's face, but I hev heard her voice. I know\r\nwhen she's glad, when she's mad, when she's sad. I hev heard her sing\r\nher baby songs when she thought nobody was listenin', an' she sings 'em\r\nlike my mother did, an' my mother wasn't false; no more is Lizzi.\"\r\n\r\nThe men clamored their approval of Blind Benner's tribute to Lizzi, but\r\nMrs. McAnay remained silent, still doubting, and Lizzi, though her heart\r\nhungered for her mother's trust, would not ask for it.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nLIZZI STOPS A FIGHT.\r\n\r\nSaturday evening was a money-making time for the landlord of the\r\n\"Three-Girls\" Tavern, as the inn was familiarly called. On that evening\r\nold scores were wiped off the slate and new ones opened, to be\r\nlengthened during the coming week until on the next Saturday they\r\nfollowed their predecessors into Nowhere. Into Nowhere? Perhaps. But\r\nMemory hides in Nowhere, and Memory is terrifying when she catches one\r\nin a lonely way and brings him up with hair on end, as he gazes at the\r\ndog Conscience, whose leash she seems ready to let slip that he may rend\r\nthe poor wayfarer. Yet, the score is erased from the landlord's slate\r\nand, it may be, from memory's tablet--for the nonce.\r\n\r\nThe usual Saturday night crowd had gathered in the bar-room, and tongues\r\nhad been loosened by drink. Words flew thick and fast. Language was not\r\nchoice. At short intervals there was a demand for an apology, or a\r\nfight. The McAnay brothers were there and all drinking, though not very\r\ndeeply. Cassi, who was standing treat, was the centre of a group of\r\nmuscular men, some of whom were intoxicated. The glasses had been filled\r\nwith pure rye whiskey. They were held high in the air, then they were\r\nclinked, while the landlord bowed and smirked as he waited for the\r\ntoast.\r\n\r\nHenry Myers gave it.\r\n\r\n\"Here's ter yer and the rest uv yer family, and ter the rightin' uv yer\r\nsister's fair name.\"\r\n\r\nCassi's face flushed. Levi and Matthi scowled, but the others drank off\r\nthe toast with a smack. Levi, Matthi, and Cassi did not drink, but the\r\nlatter pretended to do so, holding the glass to his lips. When the\r\nothers were done and the glasses rattled on the bar, he removed the\r\nglass from his lips. The whiskey was untouched. Before a question arose\r\nas to why he had not drank, he spit into the liquid and threw it into\r\nHenry's face.\r\n\r\n\"Thet's the way I drink such a toast, Hen Myers.\"\r\n\r\nHenry, pale with rage and goaded by the challenge and the loud laugh\r\nthat greeted Cassi's act, leaped at the latter, but was met with a blow\r\nthat staggered, but did not fell him.\r\n\r\n\"Yer hed no bizness ter drag my sister's name inter this bar-room,\"\r\nyelled Cassi, following up his advantage and striking Henry fairly\r\nbetween the eyes, knocking him against the bar.\r\n\r\n\"She's dragged her own name in the mud,\" shouted Tom Myers, Henry's\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\n\"Yer a liar!\" Matthi replied.\r\n\r\nThey began to fight. Levi stood by, a smile of admiration playing around\r\nhis mouth, while he urged his brothers to do their best. The crowd\r\ncleared a space. The landlord implored the fighters to cease, but their\r\nblood was hot. The spectators knew they would behold a rare struggle,\r\nwith the odds against Cassi and Matthi, for the Myers brothers were\r\nnotorious fighters and older men. Man to man was the rule of the\r\nThree-Sisters code of honor, and Levi stood by, ready to continue the\r\nfight in the place of the first vanquished brother.\r\n\r\nHenry Myers rushed on Cassi again and, seizing him in his powerful arms,\r\nthrew him with great force on the floor. There he lay senseless; his\r\nhead had struck against the bar.\r\n\r\nImmediately Levi, the queer, leering smile hovering around his mouth,\r\nleaped into the fray and dealt Henry a blow that shut one eye. His\r\ndexterity was applauded by the spectators, who thought it a great pity\r\nthat Levi had not opened the fight instead of Cassi, who was too light\r\nfor Henry, whom Levi fairly mated. Matthi was not faring well with Tom\r\nMyers, and the way the struggle was going it looked as if Levi and Tom\r\nwould be left as sole contestants, when into the midst of the fighters\r\nrushed Lizzi, brandishing the poker, a long iron rod, which she had\r\nsnatched from the stove as she entered.\r\n\r\nHunch had seen her on the opposite side of the street, and, running to\r\nher, had said, \"Hooray! Lizzi, the boys is gettin' in great licks fer\r\nyer.\"\r\n\r\nPausing, she listened to his proud story of how the fight began; and,\r\nwithout waiting for him to conclude, crossed the street quickly and\r\nentered the tavern, the dwarf following closely.\r\n\r\nIn the low-ceilinged bar-room, where the smoke from strong pipes almost\r\nstifled her, she stood, an Amazon before whom the fighters fell back\r\nsullenly. There was majesty in her demeanor, and upon her face no sign\r\nof shame. Honest motherhood and sincere sisterly gratitude, pride, and\r\naffection flashed from her eyes, deepened the modest blush on her\r\ncheek, and trembled in her tones.\r\n\r\n\"I am thankful to you, Levi and Matthi, and to you, dear Cassi.\"\r\nKneeling, she kissed the forehead of the unconscious man.\r\n\r\nWhen she rose, the poker fell from her fingers and struck the floor with\r\na dull thud. Standing firmly, with one foot advanced, she continued:\r\n\"Yes, dear boys, I'm thankful to you, but my name needs no defence.\"\r\n\r\nA hush followed her words, then a cheer broke involuntarily from her\r\nhearers. The Myers brothers looked at each other furtively, and a smile\r\nappeared on Levi's face, who was uninjured. Matthi, whose mouth was\r\nbleeding, betrayed by the expression of his eyes his pride in the sister\r\nfor whom he had fought. Some of the spectators stepped forward to raise\r\nCassi, but Lizzi intercepted them. Then pointing to her brother, she\r\nregally commanded the Meyers boys.\r\n\r\n\"You killed him; now take him to his old mother.\"\r\n\r\nMurder! a shiver ran through the crowd.\r\n\r\nThe Myers brothers looked at the men around them. A living wall\r\nencompassed them, which at a woman's bidding would topple and crush\r\nthem. They could not pierce it. Lizzi stamped her foot and startled them\r\ninto action.\r\n\r\nThey lifted Cassi gently. Lizzi pointed to the door. The crowd fell\r\nback. Levi and Matthi led the way. Next them came Thomas and Henry with\r\nCassi's limp form. Lizzi followed, and the crowd escorted them. At the\r\nedge of the assemblage were boys whose shrill voices broke the silence.\r\nVengeance was held in abeyance by a woman's whim; and Thomas and Henry\r\nMyers walked unsteadily, fearful that, Herodias-like, she would have\r\ntheir heads.\r\n\r\nBefore they were half-way to the Block the constable appeared, and to\r\nthe stern assemblage added the subtle, intangible when not provoked, but\r\nwhen angered terrible, presence of the law.\r\n\r\nNearer to the Block the crowd approached. Doors and windows were thrown\r\nopen hastily, and broad beams of light fell across the street, while\r\ncurious persons thrust out their heads to learn the cause of the unusual\r\nprocession marching so grimly over the bands of light and darkness.\r\n\r\nNearer still to the Block the column came. Soon the heavy footsteps on\r\nthe porch would strike terror to the aged mother's heart, already half\r\nbroken by doubt. Soon to the feet of that doubting mother would be borne\r\nthe senseless form of her youngest son, stricken down in defence of his\r\nsister's fair name. Halt, pressing crowd eager to witness a heart-break.\r\n\r\nBut the Queen had commanded, and there was no alternative.\r\n\r\nThere was a momentary halt at the door as if for orders, every man\r\nacting as if under a spell which she alone could break. But she could\r\nnot speak. Her voice seemed dead in her throat.\r\n\r\nThe door was open and she saw her mother, who did not look up as Levi\r\nand Matthi entered. The Myers brothers with their burden crossed the\r\ndoor-sill, and Lizzi, a queen no more, but a remorseful, dejected woman,\r\nstood in the open door, with her profile to the crowd, keeping it at\r\nbay.\r\n\r\nMrs. McAnay was apparently asleep, and the noise of the heavy shuffling\r\nfeet had not waked her. Her head rested on one hand, her elbow supported\r\nby the arm of the chair.\r\n\r\n\"Mother.\"\r\n\r\nLevi spoke low.\r\n\r\n\"Mother, wake up.\"\r\n\r\nHe shook her gently. Her head drooped a little lower, but her eyes\r\nremained closed.\r\n\r\n\"Mother, get awake.\"\r\n\r\nHis voice was harsh and loud, and the shake he gave her vigorous and\r\nsudden, but her head only drooped lower.\r\n\r\nThe Myers brothers had laid Cassi on the floor at her feet, and were\r\nstanding at a little distance from her. Matthi, stanching the flow of\r\nblood from his lips, stood near the door.\r\n\r\nIt was a cruel scene, this attempt on the part of an older son to arouse\r\nhis mother to the knowledge of the injury done to her best beloved, and\r\nin silence the spectators beheld it.\r\n\r\nSharply the stillness was broken as Lizzi, with a shriek, threw herself\r\nacross Cassi and buried her face in her mother's lap.\r\n\r\n\"Dead, dead!\" she moaned, \"Cassi and mother--and both for me!\"\r\n\r\nCassi was restored to his senses by the jar of her fall upon him, and\r\nThomas Myers saw in his opening eyes the return of life.\r\n\r\n\"Cassi's livin'!\" he cried. \"He's opened his eyes.\"\r\n\r\nBut only Henry Myers heeded him. The others were engrossed by the awful\r\nscene before them.\r\n\r\nLevi and Matthi, stunned by the sudden death of their mother, were\r\nmotionless. Their wits had apparently deserted them, and they were\r\nunable to comprehend the situation.\r\n\r\nLizzi did not remain long on her knees. Struggling to her feet, she tore\r\nopen her dress at the neck, as if to give her greater freedom in\r\nbreathing, but really to reach her marriage-certificate, which she\r\nsnatched from the little pocket made for it and held it before her\r\nmother.\r\n\r\n\"Are your eyes open in heaven, mother? If they are, read this. You died\r\nwithout seein' it.\"\r\n\r\nOf the gaping, mystified crowd none guessed what the crumpled paper was.\r\nThrusting it back in its hiding-place, she turned to the wide-mouthed\r\nthrong, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Leave us alone.\"\r\n\r\nSlowly the burly men and curious boys went away in obedience to the\r\npathetic command. Thomas Myers closed the door behind him, shutting\r\nHenry in, who, thoroughly repentant, remained to be of service.\r\n\r\nCassi, who had staggered to his feet, seeing him, made an attack upon\r\nhim, muttering as he swayed in uncertain advance:\r\n\r\n\"Yer hed no bizness ter drag my sister's name inter this bar-room!\"\r\n\r\nHe tried to shake off Lizzi's enfolding arms, but they held him firmly.\r\n\r\n\"It's all right, dear Cassi. You fought hard; but Hen's apologized, and\r\nif you make a noise you will wake mother. Now go to bed.\"\r\n\r\nShe led him to the foot of the stairs and kissed him good-night. He\r\nobeyed her, for her will was dominant in that household.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nLIZZI PROVES HER INNOCENCE.\r\n\r\nWhen Cassi had entered his room, Lizzi lifted her mother and laid her on\r\nher bed. Then she sent Levi for Margaret Reed, a little, winning,\r\nsympathetic woman who was summoned on all occasions. In times of sorrow\r\nshe shed a soft radiance on darkened hearts, and in times of rejoicing\r\nshe was bright as the sunshine. \"Send for Gret\"--no one called her Mrs.\r\nReed; toddlers said \"Det\"--was the suggestion of sadness, the impulse of\r\njoy, and Gret, childless herself, but mother to all the babies and\r\nsister to all the mothers of the village, answered every call.\r\n\r\nShe had no rebuke for Henry Myers, whom she met as she entered the\r\nMcAnay home, except such as just hearts will sometimes express by an\r\nunconscious manner of repugnance. Henry was sensitive enough to feel it,\r\nand he departed cursing himself bitterly.\r\n\r\nGret went straight to Lizzi, and felt like a giantess as the latter\r\nknelt before her and clung to her dress.\r\n\r\n\"I killed her, Gret; I killed her. I never told her, and it broke her\r\nheart; and I am a murderer, worse than Henry Myers would have been if he\r\nhad killed Cassi. She couldn't think it was all right, and when she\r\nheard the boys was fighting for me, she couldn't stand it any longer and\r\njust died where I left her. And I was so crazy to have Cassi brought\r\nhome, so I could say to her, 'There, mother, you see how he believed in\r\nme, fightin' till he died;' but the Lord shut her eyes so she couldn't\r\nsee the cruel sight. Yes, I'm punished for my stubborn silence. If I had\r\nshowed it to her she wouldn't have died so sudden.\"\r\n\r\nGret did not invite confidence by asking Lizzi what she should have\r\nshown her mother.\r\n\r\n\"And poor father,\" Lizzi continued, \"away out in the cabin alone, his\r\nwife dead and his daughter disgraced--how will I tell him that mother is\r\ndead?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll send Seth,\" said Gret; \"and while he is gone we must get your\r\nmother ready for the grave.\"\r\n\r\nGret went out, and soon came back with the news that Seth was on his way\r\nto Peter McAnay's cabin.\r\n\r\nLizzi was more composed, and assisted Gret in preparing the body for\r\nburial.\r\n\r\nIt was near daybreak when Peter reached his home. Gret met him at the\r\ndoor. Levi, Matthi, and Cassi rose to receive him. They had been sitting\r\nin the room where their mother died. Blind Benner lay asleep on a bench,\r\nand Hunch was crouching in a corner. Lizzi was with the dead. She heard\r\nher father's voice in response to the greeting of her brothers, but did\r\nnot move from her knees.\r\n\r\nHer father's step on the stairs told of his approach. She bowed her head\r\nlower and clasped her hands. Her posture was one of utter dejection. Her\r\nfather stood over her. She did not move. He spoke to her. She did not\r\nreply.\r\n\r\nHe glanced at the bed, and saw how tastefully she had dressed her mother\r\nfor the grave. He could see through the mist in his eyes that the dress\r\nwas not stiff in its folds, but gracefully draped the rigid form. He was\r\ntouched by the natural arrangement of the snow-white hair.\r\n\r\n\"Yer hev drest yer mother pretty, Lizzi; she's sleepin' nateral.\"\r\n\r\nThis broke Lizzi down completely, and she fell forward, with her face\r\nbetween her father's boots and her arms outstretched.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, father, forgive me for bein' so bad! I killed mother. I killed her\r\nby not tellin'.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Lizzi began to speak, Levi closed the stair door. The noise he\r\nmade, though not loud, was sufficient to wake Blind Benner. By Levi's\r\ndirection, Hunch led the blind man to his home.\r\n\r\nLizzi lay on the floor moaning and calling herself \"a bad, bad woman.\"\r\n\r\nHer father's heart almost burst. Could it be after all that she was\r\ndishonest? Could it be that her mother had read her aright? Could it be\r\nthat she had cruelly encouraged his faith in her, knowing the certainty\r\nof his discovery of the truth at last? No, no; it could not be. In his\r\ndesperation he became calm, with the forced self-control that makes many\r\na man firm on the gallows. His tones had not a ring of hope as he said:\r\n\r\n\"Don't grovel there, Lizzi. Stand up. There's yer old dead mother, and\r\nhere's yer old dyin' father. Git up and face her and me, and tell the\r\ntruth, and it all too, mind.\"\r\n\r\nHis voice grew sharp and commanding; never had he spoken so sternly to\r\nher. She slowly lifted herself and looked first at the dead, then at her\r\nfather. A shudder passed over her. He mistook her manner for fear, and\r\nwas convinced she had deceived him. Taking one step forward, he lifted\r\nhis hand to strike her and huskily exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"You hussy!\"\r\n\r\nA spasm passed over her face, then she calmly awaited the blow. The look\r\nin her eyes checked it. When his hand fell to his side, she spoke:\r\n\r\n\"I forgive you, father, for the dead mother's sake.\"\r\n\r\nHer tones were deep and tender, and he bowed before the majesty of\r\nunsullied womanhood. He knew without further assurance that she was\r\npure.\r\n\r\n\"Call the boys,\" she said in quiet command. He obeyed her, and her\r\nbrothers promptly responded. For a moment she gazed upon them tenderly\r\nas they stood mutely expectant behind their father; and then, with one\r\nof her royal gestures, put her hand to her neck and tore open her dress,\r\nexposing her bosom.\r\n\r\n\"My heart's white as that,\" she said, tapping with her finger-tips the\r\nfair skin, \"and there's the proof of it.\"\r\n\r\nShe handed her marriage-certificate to her father with manner as stately\r\nas if it were the title to a throne. His hands trembled so he could not\r\ngrasp it, and it fell to the floor. Levi picked it up.\r\n\r\n\"Read it to us, Lizzi,\" he requested.\r\n\r\n\"No, I want you to see it and read it for yourselves.\"\r\n\r\nThen he read it aloud. They were overjoyed at this confirmation of their\r\nfaith in her. Peter fell on his daughter's neck and begged her\r\nforgiveness. With a kiss she sealed it, already granted.\r\n\r\nWhen she could control her voice she said: \"John's mother was opposed to\r\nour marriage, and threatened to cut him out of her property. John is\r\ndead, or he would have come back to me.\"\r\n\r\nLizzi had schooled herself, and was able to utter that sentence as she\r\nwould have told a bit of ordinary news.\r\n\r\n\"So I never told you, and let mother die without knowin' I wasn't bad,\r\nbecause I don't want John's mother to know he left a wife, for she would\r\ncut me off without anything, and after a while I might want to claim her\r\nproperty for John's child.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" said Cassi, a vision of wealth gleaming before him.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" echoed Matthi, glad of Lizzi's prospects.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" ejaculated Levi, seeing ahead a sensational lawsuit that would\r\nlikely come on by the time he was admitted to practice and make him\r\nfamous.\r\n\r\nBut the father said:\r\n\r\n\"I hope Gill's money will come ter yer, Lizzi; but I'm gladder of thet\r\nwritin' than if yer had the wealth of Nebuchadnezzar. I'd a great deal\r\nrather see you eatin' grass and know yer was clean, than have yer livin'\r\nin a king's palace, foul.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a thrilling speech dramatically delivered.\r\n\r\n\"And you'll keep my secret, boys? Tell them to, father.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will,\" they answered, without waiting for their father's command,\r\nand speaking earnestly, as if they took an oath.\r\n\r\nFrom downstairs came a rattling of the stove doors. Gret, unconscious of\r\nthe dramatic incident upstairs, was getting breakfast. She did not\r\nwonder why Peter had called his sons. She was not inquisitive, not\r\nofficious, but sympathetic and helpful.\r\n\r\n\"I must tell one woman,\" Lizzi said, \"for I can't bear to have all my\r\nsex have a bad opinion of me. So I'll tell Gret Reed. Levi, you go down\r\nand help her a minute, while I tidy up a bit.\"\r\n\r\nGret had breakfast on the table when Lizzi came downstairs, and the\r\nhungry brothers had taken their seats. Peter stood at the foot of the\r\ntable. Gret was at Lizzi's accustomed place; the mother's chair at the\r\nhead of the table was vacant. Lizzi went to Gret: \"You take mother's\r\nplace.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Lizzi, that is your seat now. I will sit where you used to.\"\r\n\r\nGret would not yield to Lizzi's urgent request.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said Lizzi, \"I can't sit there till you read that and know I\r\ndon't shame my mother's place.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Lizzi!\" Gret began in protest, but Lizzi interrupted:\r\n\r\n\"Read it; you have trusted me, and I'll trust you.\"\r\n\r\nGret took the marriage-certificate, read it, and returned it without a\r\nword. A soft smile was the only indication of joy at Lizzi's\r\nvindication.\r\n\r\n\"I have good reason for wantin' nobody else to know it' Gret. Now sit\r\ndown to breakfast.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nAN OATH.\r\n\r\n\"It's not worth the paper it's written on, except to show us our sister\r\nis pure.\"\r\n\r\nLevi addressed his father and brothers in the school-room on the Sunday\r\nfollowing his mother's funeral. He referred to the marriage-certificate\r\nwhich Lizzi guarded so carefully.\r\n\r\nHunch Blair lay close to the floor, under a desk which protected him\r\nfrom discovery. During the day he had heard Levi tell Cassi to come to\r\nthe school-house in the evening. Suspecting something interesting, he\r\ngot there before the McAnays.\r\n\r\n\"It's no good, I say,\" Levi continued, \"and there's nothing left for us\r\nto do but bring the sneak back and have Parson Lawrence marry him and\r\nLizzi. And if he won't come, why, settle with him, that's all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, tar and feather and then burn him,\" suggested Matthi as his idea\r\nof settlement.\r\n\r\n\"No, lynch him,\" Cassi advised.\r\n\r\n\"Well, we must lose no time,\" said Levi.\r\n\r\n\"But Lizzi believes Gill is dead,\" Peter remarked.\r\n\r\n\"Dead nothin',\" replied the stolid Matthi. \"He's most likely foolin'\r\nanother girl some place, and I'd like ter git a chance ter put a stop to\r\nhis gallantin'.\"\r\n\r\nMatthi made a gesture suggestive of wringing the neck of a chicken.\r\n\r\n\"Come, boys,\" Levi said, \"let's swear. Join your right hands to mine\r\nabove our father's head. Now say, we are three brothers whose sister\r\nhas been deeply wronged, and we do swear in the presence of our aged\r\nfather and upon our honor as men to seek John Gillfillan, our sister's\r\nbetrayer, and compel him to return to her and make her his wife, and if\r\nhe will not, to avenge our sister's honor by his blood.\"\r\n\r\n\"We swear,\" they all said solemnly, after the formula had been repeated.\r\n\r\nPeter bowed his approval, and encouraged them by saying:\r\n\r\n\"Go to-morrer, boys, and God bless ye. I'll take care of Lizzi.\"\r\n\r\nLevi pulled from his pocket some money, not very much, although it was\r\nthe savings of two years, and began counting it in the moonlight, while\r\nthe others watched him curiously. He fingered the bills fondly. He\r\nslowly dropped the gold coins into his hat, and listened with evident\r\ndelight to the clinking of the falling pieces. He held the silver close\r\nto the window, and looked from it to the gold, from the gold to the\r\nmoon.\r\n\r\n\"The moon is a silver dollar, and the sun is a twenty-dollar\r\ngold-piece.\"\r\n\r\nAbout to make a sacrifice, he said a silly thing that his father and\r\nbrothers should think he gave easily and without pain.\r\n\r\n\"There, father,\" he said, turning first the silver, then the gold, into\r\nhis father's hat, and on top of the yellow and argent pile laying the\r\npaper money, \"there, father, that's for Lizzi, and will keep her until\r\nwe come back, bringing her husband. If we don't find him, we'll work for\r\nher.\"\r\n\r\nPeter, seized with a fit of trembling, sat down helplessly, and picking\r\nup the hat, ran his fingers among the coins, clinking them. Cassi and\r\nMatthi looked on in quiet admiration, both wishing heartily that the\r\nbalance due them on the furnace books was not so light. Although half\r\nashamed to place his small savings beside Levi's princely gift, Matthi\r\nremarked:\r\n\r\n\"Guess if we put our money together it would look bigger, Cassi.\"\r\n\r\n\"Kind of small potatoes beside of Levi's pile,\" Cassi replied; \"but if\r\nLevi will write us an order, we'll sign it, hey, Matthi?\"\r\n\r\nLevi had with him an inkstand, a then new invention for the pocket, and\r\npen and paper. He wrote the order in the moonlight, and the brothers\r\nsigned it.\r\n\r\n\"God bless ye all!\" exclaimed Peter as he received the order. \"Ye are\r\nthe best sons any man ever had. Oh! if yer mother's lookin' down on us,\r\nshe's not ashamed ter hold her head up among the angels, 'less she feels\r\nbad 'bout not believin' in Lizzi.\" He put the money and order in his\r\npocket. When they were secure, Levi hoisted a window on the dark side of\r\nthe school-house and crawled through it. Then he helped his father out,\r\nand the others followed. For a moment they stood under the trees and\r\nbreathed the resinous atmosphere of the woods just budding.\r\n\r\nThere was a silent shake of the father's trembling hand by each son in\r\nturn, and then they parted.\r\n\r\nLizzi got the usual early Monday breakfast, but made places for four\r\nonly. Levi's school was closed for the year, and she meant he should\r\nenjoy a long morning nap if he chose. Her father came down, and she\r\ninquired if he had called Matthi and Cassi.\r\n\r\n\"I looked in their room, but they're up,\" he replied.\r\n\r\n\"Up? Funny I didn't hear them. Wonder where they could have gone this\r\ntime in the morning without any breakfast.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's no tellin',\" was Peter's answer.\r\n\r\nFather and daughter ate silently. When his hunger was satisfied, Peter\r\nkissed her and, taking his axe and bundle, departed to the chopping.\r\n\r\nThe morning slipped by. Matthi and Cassi did not return, and Levi's\r\nsleep seemed endless. Lizzi went to his door and listened, but heard no\r\nsound. Pushing the door open a little, she looked in. The room was\r\nempty. The bed had not been slept in that night. On the wash-stand lay a\r\nnote addressed to her in Levi's writing.\r\n\r\n\"DEAR LIZZI: We have gone to find out for you all about John Gillfillan.\r\n\r\n  YOUR THREE BROTHERS.\"\r\n\r\n\"Father knew it,\" she said, with a soft smile. \"I hope the boys will\r\nbring me good news; but I know John is dead.\"\r\n\r\nShe had not wept for her husband, but for him a constant stream of grief\r\nflowed through her being, a river of soul-tears, no sound of its current\r\nrising to the surface.\r\n\r\nShe was almost entirely alone now. No one came to see her except Gret\r\nReed and Mrs. Hornberger. Even Blind Benner and Hunch seemed to have\r\ndeserted her, for they were missing from the town.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nHUNCH AND BLIND BENNER VISIT BILL KELLAR.\r\n\r\n\"I know somethin' I won't tell,\" was Hunch's greeting to his blind\r\nfriend on the Monday following the secret meeting of the McAnays in the\r\nschool-house.\r\n\r\n\"Yer allers knowin' somethin', and it ain't nothin' when a feller finds\r\nit out.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it's somethin'; no little niggers in a peanut-shell this here\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\nHunch lowered his voice to a whisper, as he led Benner to the rear of\r\nthe store. There he continued:\r\n\r\n\"Levi, Cassi, and Matthi's gone ter find Gill.\"\r\n\r\nBenner gave a start, and would have uttered an exclamation, had not\r\nHunch prevented him by laying a hand over his mouth and saying:\r\n\r\n\"Hush.\"\r\n\r\n\"They'll mebbe kill him,\" he continued.\r\n\r\n\"What fer?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fer not marryin' Lizzi right.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lizzi don't know,\" Benner asserted.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, she does,\" Hunch replied.\r\n\r\n\"Yer a liar,\" and Blind Benner struck at Hunch.\r\n\r\nHe dodged, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Can't yer keep quiet? Lizzi don't want nobody ter know it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yer a bigger liar than ever, an' yer ain't no friend uv mine.\"\r\n\r\nBenner spoke louder than before, and sprang at Hunch, but missed him,\r\nand would have fallen against the counter had not Hunch caught him.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, there, boys! What are you fighting about?\" Colonel Hornbeger\r\ncalled from the desk.\r\n\r\n\"Nothin',\" Benner replied surlily; and Hunch said, \"Benner's mad 'cause\r\nI told him somethin' he didn't like.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, no fighting here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Say, Benner, what'd yer call me a liar fer?\" Hunch asked when the\r\nColonel's back was turned.\r\n\r\n\"'Cause yer sed Lizzi knowed she was married wrong.\"\r\n\r\nThis was spoken in a whisper so the Colonel would not hear it.\r\n\r\n\"Didn't say nothin' uv the kind. I sed she knowed the boys hed gone\r\nhuntin' fer Gill.\"\r\n\r\n\"They won't ketch him,\" the blind man stated. \"If he's run off, he'll\r\nhide from 'em, but he couldn't hide from me.\"\r\n\r\nHunch did not laugh at this declaration. He had equal faith in the blind\r\nman's ability as a detective, and expressed it.\r\n\r\n\"They orter hev took yer with 'em.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, they orter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hunch!\" called the clerk who had succeeded Gill. He responded, and was\r\nsent to the cellar. When he returned, Blind Benner had formed his plan\r\nand was ready to disclose it.\r\n\r\n\"Hunch, Gill must be brung back ter Lizzi, an' I want yer ter take me\r\nter the McAnay boys an' I'll help find him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll do it, Benner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hand, then, Hunch.\"\r\n\r\nThey closed the compact, which had been made in whispers, with a\r\nvigorous hand shaking.\r\n\r\nBill Kellar stood before the door of his house, shouting at the top of\r\nhis voice as if he bayed the moon, just rising over the top of Bald\r\nMountain. Echo, hiding in the shadow, replied to him. He would shout,\r\nthen listen to his voice coming back, mellowed and musical.\r\n\r\n\"Bill's got 'nuther crazy fit,\" said Hunch, pausing at the gate, while\r\nBenner leaned against the fence to rest. In one hand the dwarf carried\r\nhis cornet, in the other Blind Benner's fiddle, enclosed in a green bag.\r\n\r\n\"You fellows are always welcome on this plantation,\" said Bill, coming\r\nto meet them, and grasping Benner's hand affectionately, while he\r\nplayfully knocked Hunch's hat over his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Say, Bill,\" inquired the dwarf, \"what 'er yellin' at, the sky?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Hunch, I'll tell you and Benner, for I know you will keep it\r\nsecret. I'm working on an invention that will be a blessing to the folks\r\nthat live in cities. I mean a sound-softener.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sound-softener, thet runs off yer tongue slick as soft-soap.\"\r\n\r\nBlind Benner was very angry at this lack of reverence, but Bill only\r\nlaughed, and replied:\r\n\r\n\"It does slip easily, too much so, or I'd have found it out before now\r\nand had the right thing patented.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why don't yer set a trap fer it?\" Hunch inquired seriously.\r\n\r\n\"Hunch, yer a fool!\" Benner exclaimed angrily.\r\n\r\n\"Jist find it out?\" the dwarf asked serenely.\r\n\r\nBill continued:\r\n\r\n\"I've been experimenting, but I have only one voice, and it makes the\r\nsame echo. Now, you boys shout when I do, one short loud yell. Then\r\npause and listen. Now, ready: one, two, go.\"\r\n\r\nThey shouted loudly as they could, and became instantly still. Echo sent\r\nback to them their voices, Hunch's shrill scream dominant over Bill's\r\nround full tone. In the wave of sound Benner's plaintive cry was almost\r\ndrowned. Bill clapped his hands; he was overjoyed.\r\n\r\n\"It'll work, it'll work,\" he exclaimed, \"and the dwellers in cities will\r\nthank me, thank Bill Kellar when he perfects his Echo Sound-softener. I\r\nam going to rig up a combination of walls that will reverberate sounds,\r\nmost of which will die before they reach the drum of the ear. It will\r\njust slip over the ear easily and fit it comfortably. Two people wearing\r\nsound-softeners can converse easily on the streets, undisturbed by the\r\nnoise of drays, street-cars, stages, and the shouts of the drivers.\"\r\n\r\nBill broke off abruptly here. He had become excited, and was nervously\r\nafraid his hearers did not understand him, so he ceased description and\r\nremarked:\r\n\r\n\"You will see just how it works when I get it done.\"\r\n\r\nBlind Benner said he was sure it would succeed. Hunch was silent for a\r\nwhile. Presently he observed:\r\n\r\n\"Last winter my ear-lugs shet up my hearin' purty near, and I hed ter\r\npunch a hole in 'em, and then I didn't hear very loud.\"\r\n\r\nBill looked at the goblin leering at him in the moonlight and wondered\r\nhow much mockery, how much earnestness there was in his words. As for\r\nBlind Benner, he was so much vexed as to lose his patience. Yet, willing\r\nto avoid a quarrel, he asked Bill how his violin did.\r\n\r\n\"Well, very well,\" Bill replied. \"Last night I named her Magdalene, for\r\nin her dwell seven devils of fascination. She went before me, and I\r\nfollowed. We climbed heights, we plunged into depths, until I fell\r\nprostrate, worn out in the chase after the phantom, Music, who smiled on\r\nme pityingly as she stepped into her star chariot drawn by flying\r\nmeteors.\"\r\n\r\nBlind Benner, enraptured, cried:\r\n\r\n\"Go on, go on.\"\r\n\r\nBut Hunch again checked Bill's enthusiasm by pointing to the Milky Way,\r\ndim through the moonlight, and remarking:\r\n\r\n\"Jerushy! What a lot uv crazy fiddlers' girls must be out ridin'\r\nternight.\"\r\n\r\nBenner's face at first expressed contempt, but it softened to compassion\r\nas he said:\r\n\r\n\"'Tain't yer fault, Hunch. Yer ain't got it in yer head.\"\r\n\r\nBut Bill thought Hunch had it in his head, and resolved never to mention\r\nthe sound-softener nor use high-sounding phrases before him. Becoming\r\nmore practical, he invited his guests indoors, curious to know the\r\nobject of their visit, yet too courteous to inquire. Benner did not keep\r\nhim long in ignorance.\r\n\r\n\"The McAnay boys is gone ter hunt Gill, but they'll never find him, an'\r\nme an' Hunch is goin' ter find the boys an' help 'em git Gill. Then\r\nthey'll bring him back an' make him marry Lizzi right.\"\r\n\r\n\"How can you help find him?\" Bill asked gently and not incredulously.\r\n\r\n\"By my ears. He can't fool 'em if they'd ever hear him laugh er speak,\r\nbut he might fool the boys' eyes.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's so,\" Bill assented. \"But how are you and Hunch goin' to keep up\r\nwith the big McAnays? They wouldn't want to be bothered with you.\"\r\n\r\nHe was considering the plan practically.\r\n\r\n\"We thought mebbe you'd lend us yer spring wagon,\" Benner said timidly.\r\n\r\n\"Of course I would, and drive it too, if I had somebody to look after\r\nthe place.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gee-whitaker!\" shouted Hunch. \"Wouldn't that be the dandy fun, though.\"\r\n\r\n\"We could give concerts to pay expenses,\" Bill continued, \"only I'm\r\nafraid of the devil.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thunder! I'd blow the devil up his own chimney with my horn,\" Hunch\r\nfairly screamed, greatly excited by the proposed tour.\r\n\r\nBenner trembled in silent joy. He was afraid to speak lest he should\r\nsuggest some objection to the plan and overthrow the whole scheme.\r\n\r\n\"We'd have to practice awhile together, then I'd know if the devil meant\r\nto bother me.\" Bill spoke meditatively, and continued his thought in\r\nsilence. Presently Hunch broke the quiet.\r\n\r\n\"Say, Bill, listen ter me. It's my thinkin' thet if there's enybody this\r\nside uv heaven that Satan's afeard uv, it's Parson Lawrence; an' ef yer\r\nhed somethin' uv his'n 'long with yer, I don't think the devil'd come\r\nnear yer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right, boy, right.\" Bill rushed at Hunch and shook him nervously.\r\n\"Maybe you have freed the devil-bound slave.\"\r\n\r\nBlind Benner expressed his gratitude by saying:\r\n\r\n\"Yer _ain't_ no fool, Hunch, but yer an awful tease.\"\r\n\r\nNo king ever received homage more gracefully than Hunch.\r\n\r\n\"What'll it be?\" he asked; and when the others failed to suggest\r\nanything he gave them further reason to admire his cleverness.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think Satan'd dare put his split foot on a lock uv Parson\r\nLawrence's hair.\"\r\n\r\nThat was decisive; but how to obtain a lock of Parson Lawrence's hair\r\nwas not so easily agreed upon. Finally, Hunch asserted with something of\r\na swagger.\r\n\r\n\"I'll git it, don't be afeard, fellers.\"\r\n\r\nBefore him rose a vision of the good man asleep upon his bed. A\r\nmalformed figure creeps silently across the floor. It is Hunch. He\r\nreaches the bed. He stretches out a hand, which holds a pair of shears.\r\nThere is a snap in the stillness. Soon the dwarf departs through the\r\nwindow, bearing with him a lock of the snow-white hair.\r\n\r\nBlind Benner spoiled this possible adventure.\r\n\r\n\"Don't steal it, Hunch,\" he said, \"'cause if yer do, the devil will walk\r\non it jest like he would on his own carpet, fer all stole things is\r\nhis.\"\r\n\r\nHunch's countenance fell and his manner became less confident, but yet\r\nhe declared he would be able to procure the lock of hair. However, he\r\nmade an effort to prepare Bill for disappointment by asking:\r\n\r\n\"Wouldn't cotton in yer ears do as well as the hair in the box?\"\r\n\r\nBill shook his head despondently, and replied:\r\n\r\n\"No, no; that makes me deaf for a while to the sweet voice of the\r\nviolin, become a devil's witch when my bow crosses the strings. When I\r\nrefuse to listen, the old Tempter gets into the fibre of the violin and\r\npleads by the touch of the vibrating, throbbing instrument, tender and\r\nthrilling as the caress of the woman you love.\"\r\n\r\nBlind Benner's thoughts went to Lizzi. He knew what her touch was to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nWhile talking, Bill had got the violin and was tuning it. Hunch caught\r\nup his horn and blew a series of discordant notes. A frown settled on\r\nBill's brow as he put the violin back into the box, while Hunch\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"That devil of yers couldn't stand a brass band, ef one horn scares him,\r\nan' I guess there's no use in gittin' a lock uv hair from Parson\r\nLawrence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, there is. Get it for me. When I'm alone I can't resist the\r\ntemptation sometimes, and I haven't got you to drive Satan away. Yes,\r\nHunch,\" he pleaded, \"please get it for me.\"\r\n\r\nEarly the next morning Hunch started for Parson Lawrence's home, near\r\nthe Boomer Creek church. On his way he met the mail-carrier going to\r\nThree-Sisters, and sent a note to Lizzi. It read:\r\n\r\n     \"LIZZI: Me and Benner is visitin' Bill Kellar fer fun.\r\n\r\n                                                  HUNCH.\"\r\n\r\nThe dwarf never gave a thought to the store or his father, nor for a\r\nmoment regretted the loss of a situation, which he knew would be the\r\npenalty of his unceremonious departure. The note to Lizzi would inform\r\nBenner's friends of his whereabouts and quiet their uneasiness.\r\n\r\n\"Parson,\" Hunch said, meeting the reverend gentleman at the church door,\r\n\"what der yer think crazy Bill Kellar's got inter his head now?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure I cannot imagine. A crazy man's notions are hard to guess.\"\r\n\r\n\"He still thinks the devil's got him by the ear an' makes him play the\r\nfiddle in spite of hisself.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is his old delusion, and I'm afraid he will never be rid of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But he thinks yer kin cure him, Parson.\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\" asked the kindly man, much amused, but willing to be of\r\nassistance to the violinist.\r\n\r\n\"By givin' him a lock uv yer hair ter keep in the fiddle-box, and\r\nthet'll keep the devil out so he can't coax Bill.\"\r\n\r\n\"He wants a fetich,\" the clergyman replied sharply, not inclined to\r\nencourage the superstition.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! he's crazy enough ter want anythin',\" Hunch remarked innocently,\r\nnot knowing what a fetich was, but thinking it a queer name for a lock\r\nof hair.\r\n\r\nThe minister laughed. He did not think it wrong to humor the fancies of\r\nthe insane, and so complied with the request.\r\n\r\nBill received the lock of hair with demonstrative joy and effusive\r\nthanks, and Benner shook the dwarf's hand gratefully.\r\n\r\nWithin a week the trio departed on their tour. A man whom Bill could\r\ntrust was left in charge of his farm, and a note was sent to Lizzi by\r\nher laconic correspondent:\r\n\r\n     \"LIZZI: Bill, Benner and me is gon' consertin'.\r\n\r\n                                                  HUNCH.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nTHE BROTHERS LEARN SOMETHING ABOUT GILL.\r\n\r\nThe McAnay brothers went direct to the town where Gill had said his\r\nmother lived. There they learned that he had not been seen in the\r\nvillage since his mother died.\r\n\r\n\"How long ago was that?\" Levi asked their informant.\r\n\r\n\"'Bout five year.\"\r\n\r\n\"Five years? You must be mistaken.\"\r\n\r\nLevi was staggered by the realization of the cruelty of Gill's plot\r\nagainst his sister, while Matthi and Cassi ground their teeth and\r\nclenched their hands.\r\n\r\n\"If yer don't believe me,\" said the indifferent villager, \"yer kin ask\r\nhis mother-'n-law; she lives jist over there.\"\r\n\r\n\"His mother-in-law? Has he a wife?\" Levi would not believe Gill was so\r\ndepraved.\r\n\r\n\"He hed one here; nobody knows how many he's got scattered 'round. The\r\none here died 'bout a month ago. She heard he'd marrid agin, an' the\r\nnews didn't 'gree with her. She was sickly ennyhow. Gill's a slick un,\r\nhe is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did they call him Gill here?\" Levi asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; nobody but his mother an' his wife called him John. Gillfillan's\r\ntoo long, so folks jist called him Gill, 'cept his mother-'n-law, an'\r\nshe didn't call him nuthin'.\"\r\n\r\nLevi laughed in a forced way at this, but Matthi and Cassi scowled. With\r\nhis sinister smile lighting up his face, Levi said, lightly as he\r\ncould:\r\n\r\n\"We didn't know Gill was so gay. We used to work where he did, and as we\r\nwere out of a job, thought we'd hunt him up and get something to do,\r\nsince we were passing his way.\"\r\n\r\n\"He ain't ben here fer more'n five year, as I was tellin' yer. Guess\r\nhe's somewheres in jail. He was honest 'nuff, but would go courtin' the\r\ngurls in spite uv enything.\"\r\n\r\nThe garrulous fellow was laughing at his own wit, when Levi said in a\r\ncareless way:\r\n\r\n\"Since we have heard so much about Gill, I would like to know one thing\r\nmore. He was always bragging about his rich mother and the fortune he\r\nwas going to get at her death.\"\r\n\r\nThe villager exploded in a loud guffaw at this, and, after a vigorous\r\nshaking of his sides and slapping his thighs, said, between the gasps\r\nand swallows which were distressing him:\r\n\r\n\"Why, she--well, thet's--by jiminy--well, heng it, she was a wash an'\r\nscrub woman, an' the neighburs buri'd her.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time Levi had obtained the mastery of himself, and laughed\r\nheartily, apparently, as he said:\r\n\r\n\"He was a very tall liar, and he fooled us all. Lord, how we used to\r\nenvy him when he told of his rich mother, that she was mighty\r\nfine-looking and could write such beautiful letters, and all that! Guess\r\nit was all a lie, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't write her own name; never went to school in her life.\"\r\n\r\nMatthi and Cassi were becoming restless, and their black looks attracted\r\nthe villager's attention. The brothers had met him just at the beginning\r\nof a street, and were able to have this conversation with him alone; but\r\npresently two or three curious men came up to learn the reason of the\r\nvisit of the stalwart strangers.\r\n\r\n\"These fellers knowed Gill somewheres, an' they thought he was livin'\r\nhere. Guess from the looks uv two uv 'em it wouldn't go easy fer him ef\r\nthey was ter git their han's on him.\"\r\n\r\nThe villager vouchsafed this explanation to his fellow-townsmen.\r\n\r\n\"Well, we have got a crow to pick with him if we happen to find him,\"\r\nsaid Levi, who persisted in talking for himself and his brothers,\r\nfeeling he could not trust them, they were so angry.\r\n\r\n\"Where yer from?\" asked one of the new-comers.\r\n\r\n\"Three-Sisters.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, thet's where Gill got his last wife,\" exclaimed another.\r\n\r\nLevi was thankful that it was growing so dark that faces could not be\r\nclearly distinguished. He stated frankly, believing the quickest way out\r\nof the difficulty to be the truth:\r\n\r\n\"That wife was our sister, and we are looking for him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope yer will ketch him an' bring him back here, an' I'll help yer\r\nsettle with him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\" asked Levi, struck by the fierce earnestness of the man\r\nwho had come up just in time to learn the object of the McAnays' quest.\r\n\r\n\"One uv his fathers-'n-law,\" the man replied, with brutal sarcasm.\r\n\r\n\"The father of the wife he had here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who told yer 'bout thet?\" asked the man, angrily. \"Bet 'twas thet\r\nlittle gossipin' woman, Pete Dunn, thet I seen yer talkin' ter.\"\r\n\r\nHe made a rush at Pete Dunn, but Matthi interfered.\r\n\r\n\"He was only obligin'. Natur'ly we'd ask the first person we met 'bout\r\nGill. So don't put the blame on our friend here.\"\r\n\r\nMatthi's position was so reasonable that even the angry man agreed with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe brothers went in company of the villagers to the town, and stopped\r\nall night at the inn. When they departed next morning, a crowd gathered\r\nand wished them success in bringing to justice the man who had injured\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThey went from town to town, stopping a week or more at a place, doing\r\nwhat work they could obtain, and keeping a sharp lookout for Gill. Their\r\nreticence and mutual understanding, coupled with their constant\r\nwatchfulness, excited suspicion when they first entered a village or\r\ntown, but when they departed from it they left behind many friends.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nBILL BENNER AND HUNCH JOIN A CIRCUS.\r\n\r\nThe musicians went first to Barberry, where they gave a concert, at\r\nwhich the advance agent of a circus was present on a complimentary\r\nticket given him by Bill Kellar.\r\n\r\nThere was a small audience, but the performers were not discouraged.\r\nThey began the programme with a trio, which was rather noisy than\r\nmelodious. Of this Bill was rather glad, for, although not discordant,\r\nit was sufficiently vigorous to warn the devil that there was ample\r\ndiscord in reserve to overcome the wooing of the violin should he\r\ninstigate it to tempt the violinist.\r\n\r\nNext came a violin solo by Bill, which he began nervously but played to\r\nthe end without distress. The audience demanded more, and he gave an\r\nimprovisation, a slow, insinuating thing that held the senses of the\r\nhearers with the winsome spell of an opiate.\r\n\r\nHunch followed as the \"Human Bagpipes,\" introduced by Bill, who spoke of\r\nhim as \"the unpremeditated, one of impulsive Nature's whims, a man full\r\nof unexpected things and bountifully provided with breathing apparatus.\"\r\n\r\n\"The hump on his back,\" Bill continued, \"is not a deformity, but an\r\nabundance. Consumption would grow weary in trying to absorb his lungs,\r\nand pneumonia hesitates to attack him. He is triple-lunged, and the bump\r\non his back is the home of the third one. In this curved space the\r\nsuperfluous, yet useful, lung inflates and collapses, and from it are\r\nemitted the musical notes which you will now listen to. It is with great\r\npleasure, ladies and gentlemen, that I introduce to you Mr. Blair.\"\r\n\r\nHunch got up on the platform and made a bow that caused everybody to\r\nlaugh, it was so comically affected. Bill noticed with pride that the\r\ncircus agent paid more attention to the bagpipe imitation than he had\r\ndone to his own solo. A veritable Scotchman Hunch seemed as he wriggled\r\nhis back and piped the \"Campbells are coming.\" For an encore he gave\r\n\"Annie Laurie.\" He himself could not give an explanation of the manner\r\nof producing the peculiar tones that so closely resembled the bagpipes.\r\nHe knew only that his mouth was partly open while it emitted the sounds,\r\nand that instinctive, rather than intended, movements of his jaws,\r\nassisted by nervous contractions and expansions of his throat and chest,\r\nforced out the notes. When he finished the encore he was loudly\r\napplauded, and a repetition was insisted upon. Hunch was obliging, and\r\nplayed on his larynx the ever-popular \"Bessie, the Maid of Dundee.\"\r\n\r\nThe next thing on the programme was a series of magical tricks performed\r\nby Bill, who claimed to have been a pupil of Signor Blitz. These pleased\r\nthe audience, and they cried for more. He executed all he knew, and then\r\ntreated them to some ventriloquism, which was not good, but delighted\r\nthem nevertheless.\r\n\r\nThe musicians remained in Barberry another night, and the school-house\r\nwould not hold the crowd that came to hear the demon-driven fiddler, his\r\nblind second, and the human bagpipes.\r\n\r\nThe circus agent was again in attendance, and concluded that it would be\r\nwise to compromise with the opposition show. So he made the musicians a\r\nliberal offer, which they accepted, thus becoming a part of Barkup's\r\nColossal Aggregation. With it they wandered from town to town,\r\nexhibiting twice a day, but doing none of the drudgery attendant upon\r\nthe pitching and striking of the tents.\r\n\r\nThey gave their performances in a side-show, and during the exhibition\r\nin the big tent played with the band. Only here Blind Benner handled the\r\nbow, playing second to Bill, who was leading violin.\r\n\r\nThe season was almost over, and the circus was working towards the\r\nEastern city whence it started. One dismal night the flickering fires of\r\npine-knots in the iron crates on the posts in front of the tents shot\r\nlong quivering lances into the darkness without seeming to illuminate\r\nit. The glib ticket-seller stood before the side-show, active and\r\npicturesque in the ruddy gleams. One minute he was half in shadow, at\r\nthe next in bold relief, as the blaze of the fires bent toward him as\r\nthough giving him its undivided attention, while he cried the list of\r\ncuriosities, phenomena, and attractions to be seen inside the tent for\r\nthe small sum of a dime.\r\n\r\nJust as the words \"human bagpipes\" fell from his lips, three men emerged\r\nfrom the darkness and stopped a few paces from the tent. They were tall,\r\nmuscular, and seemed to be listening to his fluent and wordy narrative\r\nof the annex-show. He noticed them and, beginning anew, he directed his\r\nharangue to them. Amused smiles spread over their faces when they\r\nrealized to whom his descriptions applied, and, buying tickets, they\r\nentered with the other sight-seers.\r\n\r\nHunch mounted the platform and began his bagpipe imitations. The\r\npeculiar position of his head in this vocal exercise required him to\r\nlook towards the top of the centre-pole of the tent, so that he could\r\nnot see his audience except when making his bow.\r\n\r\nWhen he finished, and the audience was tumultuously encoring him, a hand\r\nwas laid on the arm of the tallest of the three men, who stood apart\r\nfrom the crowd. Hunch, who was bowing to the mixed assemblage, missed\r\nBlind Benner from his accustomed seat, just before the stage. Hunch soon\r\ncaught sight of his blind friend, who was saying:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'm so glad ter see yer, Levi.\"\r\n\r\nLevi started in surprise at the naturalness of the greeting. After\r\nscrutinizing the blind eyes for a moment, he waved a hand close to them,\r\nbut they stared at him without blinking.\r\n\r\nHunch jumped from the platform and elbowed a way through the astonished\r\nspectators.\r\n\r\n\"Gee-whittaker, fellers! we thought yer was dead, er lost, er back in\r\nthe Sisters. We've been huntin' yer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Say, Benner, when did you leave the Sisters?\" Cassi asked.\r\n\r\n\"'Bout a week after yer fellers.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Lizzi was well then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, she was well.\"\r\n\r\nThe blind man had turned toward the stage, where Bill was standing\r\nviolin in hand, and was waiting reverently to hear the music.\r\n\r\nHunch shouted familiarly:\r\n\r\n\"Say, Bill, don't yer know yer old frien's?\"\r\n\r\nThe audience laughed at this ingenuous inquiry.\r\n\r\nSignor Kellar, as he was denominated on the bills, did not smile, but\r\nbowed gravely and slipped the violin under his chin.\r\n\r\n\"They might 'Signor' Hunch Blair all they'd a mind ter, he'd stop the\r\nbiggest show on earth ter shake han's with Lizzi's brothers,\" the dwarf\r\nmuttered.\r\n\r\nThe liquid notes of \"Home, Sweet Home\" floated to him as he stood by the\r\nexit. The air seemed to rise and fall in long undulations set in motion\r\nby the violin. In these waves the brothers bathed their weary souls. The\r\nmelody caressed them, and, thinking of their own home, they wept\r\nsilently.\r\n\r\nBlind Benner crouched at Bill's feet. A silence almost of pain held the\r\nincongruous crowd.\r\n\r\nHunch alone seemed untouched--apparently he was beyond the power of\r\nspells. He made no effort to guard Bill from the fascination of the\r\ninstrument.\r\n\r\n\"Bill don't need no horn ter let him loose,\" he growled. \"There ain't no\r\ndevil in that tune. He don't kick his feet ter eny sech. Guess Bill's\r\nplayin' fer the angels.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nBLIND BENNER FULFILS HIS PROMISE.\r\n\r\n\"How did you know me,\" Levi asked Blind Benner as they went from the\r\nside-show to the big tent.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know how; yer didn't speak and yer didn't laugh. Hunch was\r\nbagpipin', an' all at once somethin' pulled me an' I follered, an' when\r\nI got closer I knowed it was you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have a bad cough, Benner,\" Levi remarked sympathetically, as he\r\nlistened to the blind man struggling for breath.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; I ketched it soon after we left the Sisters. It goes hard with me\r\nsometimes, but mostly it's only a little hack.\"\r\n\r\nHere he caught Levi's arm and asked in a whisper:\r\n\r\n\"Did yer hear anything of him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we heard something of him, but we did not find him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yer oughter hed me with yer from the first; I'd hev found him. Bill an'\r\nHunch an' me's been huntin' yer all this time.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's why you left Three-Sisters and joined the circus?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we thought yer would come to the show when yer seen Bill's and\r\nHunch's names on the bills.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have been on another road from us. We did not see any bills posted\r\nbefore to-night. We had been workin' in a choppin' over the hill yonder,\r\nand just come to the town to settle our account and go somewhere else.\r\nBut didn't you hear anything of Gill?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nuthin'. Hunch kep' askin' 'bout him, an' I kep' watchin' the folks\r\ngoin' inter the tent when I could. I allers waited 'bout Hunch when he\r\nwas bagpipin', thinkin' mebbe Gill 'ud be in the crowd an' I'd hear him\r\nlaugh er somethin, but I didn't.\"\r\n\r\nA tear rolled over Blind Benner's cheek, and in the red firelight\r\nresembled blood.\r\n\r\nBlood! It is typical of vengeance, emblematic of atonement. It is a\r\nscarlet thread through the history of the world. On it are strung\r\ncovenants; from it dangle the names of covenant-breakers, and close to\r\nthese latter hang the names of avengers. Blood on Blind Benner's cheek.\r\nIt sent a thrill through Levi's being. The blood in his own heart warmed\r\nand leaped to his face as he grasped fraternally the blind man's hand.\r\n\r\nThen Hope, coy, fickle, and false, appeared, like a comet in the\r\nheavens, which stretched without horizon their black expanse before\r\nBlind Benner's eyes. Behind her trailed a long train of gleaming\r\npossibilities, and he said with emotion:\r\n\r\n\"We'll find him yit.\"\r\n\r\nLevi replied in a trembling voice:\r\n\r\n\"You may; we can't.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the blind man answered:\r\n\r\n\"I will.\"\r\n\r\nThen they were in the tent, and the evening show began.\r\n\r\nThe season had been prosperous, but the fall rains had set in and the\r\nroads were heavy. The labor attendant upon getting from town to town\r\nbecame arduous. Overworked men daily left the combination, and the\r\nMcAnay brothers were hired by the proprietor, who was glad to secure the\r\nservices of three able-bodied utility men.\r\n\r\nOne day early in November the Colossal Aggregation stuck in the mud, and\r\nwas unable to keep its engagement at a town in the mountains. The\r\nproprietor decided not to show at the place, but push on to the\r\ncounty-seat, where the circus was billed to appear on the following day.\r\nThe citizens of the village, however, demanded a performance for their\r\npleasure, and, as the proprietor refused to give one, there was every\r\nchance of a riot. Finally a compromise was effected at the suggestion of\r\na man who wore green goggles, and who seemed to be a ruling spirit among\r\nthe villagers. He proposed that Barkup should give each man two tickets,\r\nadmitting him and his wife or sweetheart free to the show at the\r\ncounty-seat. Barkup consented to this, and when the tickets were\r\ndistributed the circus passed on.\r\n\r\nBlind Benner lay asleep in a closed van, and knew nothing of the\r\noccurrence until in the evening, when Hunch graphically told of it.\r\n\r\n\"I tell yer,\" he concluded, \"there was a tight fit uv missin' a fight,\r\nan' Levi grinned as onconsarned as if he hed wings.\"\r\n\r\nA great crowd attended the circus at the county-seat. There was a rush\r\nand struggle for the pasteboard slips when the ticket-wagon was opened.\r\nAt times it seemed as if the vehicle would be overturned, but the\r\nticket-seller was as imperturbable as the man with green goggles, who\r\nheld his ticket between his fingers and calmly watched the embryo riot,\r\ncaused by those who had bought their tickets struggling to get through\r\nthe crowd pressing forward to buy.\r\n\r\nA youth who had in his escort two buxom girls grew tired of being\r\nhustled about. Going to the front of the wagon, he dropped on all fours\r\nand, with heroic disregard of his Sunday suit, crawled to the rear.\r\nThrusting his head between a pair of active legs, he lifted their owner\r\ninto the air as he raised his burly form erect. In a moment he was\r\nsupplied with tickets and placed on the ground the man who had squirmed\r\nupon his neck, departing as he came. Goggles laughed heartily, much\r\namused at the rustic's stratagem.\r\n\r\n\"How funny!\" a woman remarked.\r\n\r\nGoggles turned to see who had spoken. She had been pretty, but now she\r\nwas brazen and her voice sounded like a cracked cymbal.\r\n\r\n\"Mighty smart fellow, that,\" he said. \"But you may not have a ticket.\r\nLet me offer you one; see, I have two.\" He took a ticket from his\r\npocket.\r\n\r\n\"I don't need a card, thank you; I go in the back way,\" she replied,\r\nsmiling invitingly, as he thought.\r\n\r\n\"I have often wanted to see in the dressing-tent of a circus. Could you\r\ntake me in?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes. I'm a privileged character 'round this show. There's only one\r\nMlle. Faro in this country, and if she don't have her way she raises\r\nCain. I'm Mlle. Faro. Old Barkup will say, 'Walk right in, Mr. Smith, if\r\nFaro has invited you.' Yes, indeed I'm descended from the pyramids, and\r\nam cousin, many times removed, of Cleopatra.\"\r\n\r\nThe equestrienne talked thus volubly as she led the way to the\r\nante-room, her new acquaintance stumbling after her. Passing into the\r\ntent, he was given a seat on an upturned bucket placed against a\r\ntent-pole.\r\n\r\nIn the ante-room Blind Benner lay on a bed of coarse blankets. He\r\ncoughed frequently and painfully. The man in the goggles turned\r\ninquiringly towards the couch, but paused to admire a splendid gray\r\nhorse that was waiting for Mlle. Faro, who was to ride him in the grand\r\nentrée. Soon she appeared in a long riding-habit, trimmed with gold\r\ntinsel, and with a jaunty air walked to the horse. The ring-master gave\r\nthe signal. From the main tent sounded the boom of the big drum, the\r\nclash of the cymbals, and the blast of the cornet.\r\n\r\nMlle. Faro was just settling in the saddle, when she heard Blind Benner\r\ncough. Slipping to the ground, she ran to him, tucked the blanket around\r\nhim and gave him a pat on the cheek. In another moment she was\r\nacknowledging the applause of the spectators as her mettlesome horse\r\ndashed into the ring.\r\n\r\n\"By thunder, she can ride!\" exclaimed the man in goggles as he watched\r\nthe movements of the horse.\r\n\r\nShe threw him a kiss, as she returned to the ante-room, and he hastened\r\nto assist her dismount. Promising to come back soon, she retired to the\r\ndressing-room, while he resumed his seat on the inverted bucket. Before\r\nlong Mlle. Faro came out in ballet costume, and, leaning against a pole,\r\nbegan to talk in a rattling way to him.\r\n\r\nBill Kellar hurried past them and paused at the couch.\r\n\r\n\"Are you awake, boy?\" he asked gently.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" Blind Benner replied, and caught Bill's coat in his thin hand,\r\ngiving it a pull.\r\n\r\nBill understood, and, bending lower, placed his ear close to Benner's\r\nlips.\r\n\r\n\"Tell Levi I want him.\"\r\n\r\nAway went Bill like a hurricane, jostling against Faro, who gave him a\r\nslap for his rudeness. He was scarcely out of the tent, when Levi\r\nentered and asked Benner what he wanted.\r\n\r\n\"Levi,\" a low, hoarse, eager tone, \"jist knock off them green goggles\r\nthet Faro's teasin' her feller 'bout.\"\r\n\r\nJust as Levi turned, as though half in doubt, the man laughed. Instantly\r\nLevi's indecision left him, and with a bound he stood before the couple.\r\n\r\n\"Beg your pardon, Miss Faro, but I've got a curiosity to see your\r\nlover's eyes.\"\r\n\r\nThe man with the goggles did not move.\r\n\r\n\"I think you're very impudent, driver, and I'll have Barkup discharge\r\nyou,\" Mlle. Faro said indignantly.\r\n\r\nA fiendishly gleeful laugh broke from Levi's lips.\r\n\r\n\"I'll bet you a dollar that one of his eyes is blue and the other black.\r\nCome now, Miss Faro.\"\r\n\r\nThe man with the goggles moved uneasily and slipped a hand under his\r\ncoat. Levi watched him warily.\r\n\r\n\"I'll bet you five dollars that you are wrong,\" said Faro, angrily.\r\n\r\nThe man with the goggles rose quickly, and a knife flashed in his hand.\r\nLevi warded off the blow, and before it could be repeated Mlle. Faro\r\nheld his arms by his side.\r\n\r\n\"Don't stab him, dear, 'cause that would stop the show too long on the\r\nroad. Just show him your eyes, for I want to win his money.\"\r\n\r\nBefore he could free himself her deft fingers had removed the goggles.\r\n\r\n\"You see I have lost, Miss Faro,\" Levi said gayly; and then sternly\r\nadded, \"My brothers and I have been looking for you, John Gillfillan.\"\r\n\r\nHunch had come in, and was sitting on the couch. Blind Benner, leaning\r\nagainst him, was quivering with joy, and uttering low cries of\r\nsatisfaction. Mlle. Faro heard them, and went to him. When she stood by\r\nthe bed he was saying:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Hunchy, I kin die happy now, 'cause I found Gill. Won't Lizzi be\r\nglad ter know it was Blind Benner what found him?\"\r\n\r\n\"What does it all mean?\" Faro asked.\r\n\r\nHe did not reply, but Hunch answered:\r\n\r\n\"He didn't marry Levi's sister right.\"\r\n\r\n\"He didn't? Let me kick him.\"\r\n\r\nShe ran to thus express her contempt for Gill, but Levi restrained her\r\nand led him away.\r\n\r\nHunch picked up the long knife which Mlle. Faro had taken from Gill and\r\nthrown on the ground.\r\n\r\n\"Gill, you must go back to Three-Sisters and marry Lizzi,\" said Levi,\r\nwhen they were out of the tent.\r\n\r\n\"All right, Levi, I'll go; but, to tell you the truth, I'm ashamed to\r\nmeet Lizzi.\"\r\n\r\n\"I ain't doubtin' you,\" said Cassi, who, noiseless as a shadow, had\r\nfollowed to assist Levi if Gill should attempt to get away.\r\n\r\nThat was all that was said, the brothers not being talkers. One of them\r\nconstantly remained with Gill.\r\n\r\nTwo days later the Colossal Aggregation went into winter quarters, and\r\nthe members of it from Three-Sisters, accompanied by Gill, started\r\nhomewards.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nLIZZI'S VENGEANCE.\r\n\r\nOn the last night of November a gypsy-like covered wagon stopped at the\r\nfarther end of the river bridge at Three-Sisters. From it Levi and Gill\r\nalighted. Matthi and Cassi followed, and then paused to assist Parson\r\nLawrence to the ground. Levi and Gill entered the bridge immediately at\r\na rapid pace, the others following leisurely. Bill Kellar, Blind Benner,\r\nand Hunch were left in the wagon to follow later, in time to be guests\r\nat the wedding by the church's ceremony of Gill and Lizzi.\r\n\r\nShe sat near the stove, rocking the new cradle her father had brought\r\nthat day from the chopping. It was made of wild grape-vines ingeniously\r\nplaited, and rocked smoothly on oak rockers. She was very proud of it,\r\nand as she moved it with a light motion of her foot, she hummed a\r\nlullaby which had soothed both grandfather and grandchild, for they\r\nslept, he sitting in the arm-chair where his wife died. His clay pipe\r\nwas held lightly between his fingers.\r\n\r\nSome one entered without knocking, and Lizzi slowly turned from the fire\r\nat which she had been gazing vacantly. Her glad cry of welcome startled\r\nher father, and the pipe slipped to the floor, breaking it in pieces;\r\nbut he did not heed it, so astounded was he at seeing Lizzi throw her\r\narms around a man's neck and lay her head against his chest. The man\r\napparently was a stranger, but Lizzi soon informed her father who she\r\ngreeted so affectionately.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, John!\" she said, \"you have come back at last, and I'll not see a\r\nfinger pointing at me from everybody's eyes any more.\"\r\n\r\nGill had no reply ready for such a welcome, and none suggested itself to\r\nhim. So he remained silent, while Lizzi, forgetful of the open door,\r\nwept on his shoulder. Levi, gazing upon the scene, was fully repaid for\r\nhis long search for Gill.\r\n\r\nPresently Peter arose, and walked with dignity to the door. Laying his\r\nhand on the latch, he paused and said sternly:\r\n\r\n\"Ef yer come back, Mister Gillfillan, ter cure the hurt yer give Lizzi,\r\nI'll shet this door with yer inside; but ef yer ain't, better let me\r\nshet it as yer found it yerself, with yer out in the dark.\"\r\n\r\nCalmly he awaited the reply.\r\n\r\n\"If I have come for anything but Lizzi and the baby there in the cradle,\r\nI hope she will never forgive me for being away from her so long.\"\r\n\r\nGill spoke frankly.\r\n\r\nWhen Peter slammed the door he was outside, peering into the darkness\r\nand hoping to discover the sons for whom his heart longed.\r\n\r\nThe jar caused by the door being shut so positively awoke the baby, and\r\nit began to cry.\r\n\r\n\"Come see the baby, John,\" said Lizzi. \"There isn't a finer boy in the\r\nregi'n.\"\r\n\r\nThen running to the cradle, she patted and soothed the child, exclaiming\r\nin the glad language and fond tones of happy mothers: \"Oh! oh! it was\r\ntoo bad for its granddaddy to scare it awake that way.\"\r\n\r\nShe did not lift the infant from the cradle, for she wanted to keep Gill\r\nin ignorance as long as possible of the fire-mark that disfigured its\r\ncheek.\r\n\r\nHe admired his son very much, yet in lame sentences that seemed forced.\r\nA twinge of disappointment shot through Lizzi's heart, and a shadow of\r\nvexation passed over her face. Seeing the change in her countenance, he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"You know, Lizzi, that a man isn't much at praising a baby, no matter if\r\nhe thinks it the prettiest child ever born.\"\r\n\r\nThis in a measure satisfied her, and, smiling brightly, she said:\r\n\r\n\"I think he looks like you, John.\"\r\n\r\nHe laughed, and sat down in the chair she had placed for him beside the\r\none she had occupied. She, too, sat down, taking his hand in hers.\r\n\r\nThey were silent, she trying to frame a question about his absence, and\r\nhe seeking for a proper introduction to the story he meant to tell. An\r\nexclamation from Peter McAnay interrupted her just as she had formulated\r\nher inquiry and was going to utter it.\r\n\r\n\"It's Levi,\" she cried, as his voice was heard replying to his father.\r\n\r\nHastening to the door, she opened it, and paused on the threshold. Her\r\nfather was saying:\r\n\r\n\"Boys, I knowed yer was here when I waked up an' seen Gill. Yer done\r\nwell, an' yer hev yer father's blessin'.\"\r\n\r\nGathered around him were Levi, Matthi, and Cassi, and just beyond them,\r\nin the semi-darkness, she could see another person, a tall man with\r\nwhite hair and beard.\r\n\r\nGlancing quickly over her shoulder, she saw that Gill had risen and was\r\nstanding near the table on which the lighted candles stood. Had not\r\nCassi, who was nearest to her, thrown his arms around her, she would\r\nhave shut the door and run to Gill to ask him a question. But Cassi held\r\nher and was kissing her cheek, and the other boys pressed forward for a\r\nwelcome. Forced thus to remain she received her brothers, as joyously as\r\nher chilling heart would permit, gazing inquiringly the while at Parson\r\nLawrence, whom she had recognized. At last, released from her brothers'\r\nembraces, she entered the house and went to the cradle, giving Gill an\r\nappealing look for an explanation of it all as she passed him. He\r\nstepped forward to speak to her, but Peter McAnay interrupted again.\r\n\r\n\"Lizzi, we'll have a great weddin' ter-night.\"\r\n\r\nShe had dropped on her knees by the cradle to soothe the infant,\r\npetulant at being neglected. Without rising, she looked over her\r\nshoulder at Gill, who went nearer to her and said:\r\n\r\n\"Lizzi, your father and brothers think we had better be married by a\r\npreacher; then no one would question our relations.\"\r\n\r\nSlowly she rose to her full height, the baby held to her bosom, and her\r\nlook defiant, uncompromising.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" she said, \"married once to the same man is enough. If the first\r\ntime isn't right, the second can't make it so. No, I won't throw doubt\r\non my boy.\" Then she paused and kissed the child. \"No\"--something choked\r\nher, but she gulped and continued bravely--\"I won't marry you again,\r\nJohn, for it would cast doubt on the boy.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a pathetic tenderness in her voice. Not yet had she given up\r\nher husband.\r\n\r\n\"You were all right,\" exclaimed the impetuous Levi, \"but your marriage\r\nwas not legal.\"\r\n\r\nGill turned to him in silent appeal. Lizzi listened with her lips apart,\r\ngazing in mute inquiry from one to the other of the men before her.\r\nDeliberately she tore open her dress and got the marriage-certificate\r\nonce so precious in her eyes. Holding it before them with a shaking\r\nhand, she said:\r\n\r\n\"This is all I've got to keep my name clean and give my boy a right to\r\nhis father's name. Why isn't it legal?\"\r\n\r\nThere was a wail in her unsteady voice that cut her hearers to the\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n\"Because Squire Harker married you before he was commissioned, when he\r\nhad no right to issue writs or marry people.\"\r\n\r\nLevi spoke in a lawyer-like way, and the terrible meaning of each word\r\nwas plain to her.\r\n\r\n\"John, did you know it?\"\r\n\r\nHer effort to be calm was great. Her voice indicated the measure of her\r\nsuccess, as in even cold tones she asked for the truth.\r\n\r\nHe hesitated.\r\n\r\nThe certificate fluttered to the floor.\r\n\r\nAs she turned her back upon them all, Blind Benner, led by Hunch, came\r\ninto the room. She sank upon her knees. The blind man groped his way to\r\nher and knelt by her side.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, John, you wronged me! You wronged me! You wronged me!\" she repeated\r\npiteously, as she laid her head on the blind man's shoulder, and held\r\nher child close to her breast.\r\n\r\nParson Lawrence's beard was wet with the tears that flowed unheeded down\r\nhis cheeks.\r\n\r\nThe brothers looked murder as their gleaming eyes saw their old father\r\nsink helpless and undone in a chair, while their sister grovelled before\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIn Hunch's hand, partly concealed, glittered the knife Gill had drawn on\r\nLevi in the circus-tent.\r\n\r\nAll waited for Gill to act, for upon him lay the burden of proof,\r\nalthough he was really the defendant in the case. Advancing to Lizzi he\r\nlaid his hand gently on her shoulder, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Lizzi.\"\r\n\r\nHis touch restored her queenliness to her, and she stood erect in the\r\nmajesty of scorn. Her contempt flashed from her eyes as with a\r\nmagnificent sweep of her perfect arm she repelled him.\r\n\r\n\"What did you tell your mother?\" she demanded, while with bowed head he\r\nobeyed the command of the gesture.\r\n\r\nHe did not lift his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"His mother had been dead for five years,\" said Levi, angrily.\r\n\r\n\"Then who wrote this?\" she inquired imperiously, producing from the\r\npocket where it had lain beside the certificate, which she now trampled\r\nupon, the letter Gill had read to her the night before his departure on\r\nthe pretended visit to his mother.\r\n\r\nAll eyes were directed to him. His gaze was riveted to the floor.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, John, John! how could you, and in your mother's name, too?\"\r\n\r\nThat was her only rebuke when his plan to ruin her was fully revealed.\r\n\r\nWith downcast eyes and slow step she moved towards the stove, intending\r\nto destroy the letter, but Levi snatched it from her hand, and read it\r\naloud, despite her protestations.\r\n\r\nWhen he had finished the letter he leaped at Gill with a shriek of rage,\r\nand thrust it into his face. Gill did not attempt to run or show fight,\r\nas Levi's hand closed on his throat in a grip that meant sure and speedy\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n\"No, Levi, no; you must not punish him: leave that to me. And, Hunch\r\nBlair, how dare you?\"\r\n\r\nShe stamped her foot at Hunch, and entwined her fingers around Levi's,\r\nher touch thrilling Gill as always it had done when she caressed him.\r\n\r\nHunch had darted forward with the knife uplifted, but Cassi had\r\nrestrained him.\r\n\r\nMatthi had turned to Parson Lawrence, who had begun to remonstrate, but\r\nceased when Lizzi went to Gill's rescue.\r\n\r\nPeter McAnay rose and looked approvingly on his son wreaking vengeance\r\non the betrayer of his daughter, and frowned when she interfered to\r\nprevent a murder.\r\n\r\nLevi obeyed her with savage reluctance, and Gill stood free, gasping for\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\nAll the while Lizzi had held the baby to her heart, which she thought\r\nwould not thump so hard if the child were pressed against it.\r\n\r\nHunch blurted, as he gave up the knife:\r\n\r\n\"He drawed it on Levi, an' I wanted ter stick it inter him.\"\r\n\r\nThat informed Lizzi fully: Gill had been compelled to come back to her.\r\nLooking around upon her brothers, she tried to smile gratefully, but it\r\nwas a dim light that flittered across her face to leave a deeper\r\nshadow. They had meant well, but far better for her had they left Gill\r\nwhere they found him; for then, had he not returned, she would not have\r\nknown that she had been his victim, and would have continued to mourn\r\nfor him as dead, believing herself his widow.\r\n\r\nHolding the child before him, she said: \"Take your last look at him,\r\nJohn. See the fire-mark. I shivered when I first saw it, but didn't mind\r\nit long, for it made me think I had saved you from death once. But I do\r\nmind,\" and her voice rose and vibrated in scorn, \"if he bears your name.\r\nThat would be an awful mark on his soul for God to look at; a horrid\r\nugly scar that would make him hideous to the angels that rung his\r\nmother's weddin' bell.\"\r\n\r\nHer voice faltered a little as that pine-grove memory came over her, but\r\nit became strong again as she addressed Parson Lawrence.\r\n\r\n\"Will you baptize my boy?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" the saintly man replied, his voice ill controlled.\r\n\r\n\"His name will be Peter McAnay,\" she said simply. Then facing Gill, she\r\nheld the child to him.\r\n\r\n\"You may kiss him, John.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy cried when Gill pressed his lips to the purple mark.\r\n\r\nAt that moment a sharp crash of glass was heard. The elbow of a man\r\npushed by the crowd behind him on the porch had gone through a pane in\r\nthe sash.\r\n\r\n\"Let down the blind, Hunch,\" Lizzi commanded.\r\n\r\nHunch pulled the string, tied in a bow, and the green shade shut off the\r\ncrowd.\r\n\r\n\"Now, John, good-by.\"\r\n\r\nShe held out her hand to him, but withdrew it quickly. Her momentary\r\ntenderness vanished when she saw the eagerness in his eyes. She dared\r\nnot shake hands, remembering how he had clung to her in Sugar-Camp\r\nHollow. Another opportunity she dared not give him now, for he must know\r\nshe was implacable. With the boy held to her bosom as if to shield him\r\nfrom Gill, she stood erect and pointed to the door.\r\n\r\n\"Go!\"\r\n\r\nIt was a stern command.\r\n\r\nShe met his appealing look with unyielding gaze.\r\n\r\nSlowly he walked to the door.\r\n\r\n\"Wait!\" she called.\r\n\r\nHe paused, but did not turn.\r\n\r\n\"Have you any money?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he replied eagerly, and came back to her, a roll of bills in his\r\nextended hand.\r\n\r\n\"Give it to Levi.\"\r\n\r\n\"So much is mine, Levi,\" and she named an amount, remembering to a cent\r\nhow much of his money she had spent.\r\n\r\nLevi counted the sum, making change from his pocket.\r\n\r\nMatthi and Cassi stood near the door, looking on in amazement. Parson\r\nLawrence leaned against a table. Peter McAnay sat with his face buried\r\nin his hands. Hunch walked nervously around the room, while Blind Benner\r\nwaited near Lizzi, hoping she would speak to him.\r\n\r\nLevi returned the balance of the money to Gill; he proffered it to\r\nLizzi.\r\n\r\n\"Not a cent,\" she said proudly. \"The money you gave Levi is what I spent\r\nof his savin's, when I thought I was your wife; but not a cent of your\r\nmoney will I take from this on. I'll scrub and wash for a livin', if I\r\nmust, and Benner, here, will help take care of little Peter. Now go!\"\r\n\r\nCompelled to give vent to her feelings, she impulsively kissed Blind\r\nBenner. His hand was across her eyes as he lovingly felt her face, and\r\nshe did not see Gill pass through the door.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nBLIND BENNER SEES LIZZI.\r\n\r\nWhen Gill left Lizzi he was her subject; and no exile, however long,\r\ncould diminish his loyalty to her. All his mature years he had been a\r\nlibertine, cold, clever, selfish. No thrill except that of passion had\r\nstirred his blood, quickened his pulses; yet they beat quickly now as he\r\nstood outside of the home whose threshold he dared not cross. In his\r\ndespair he loved the woman whom he had wronged.\r\n\r\nA hard gripe was fastened on his collar. He closed his eyes and hoped he\r\nhad been seized by one of her brothers who meant to kill him.\r\n\r\n\"Stop with me ter-night, Gill.\"\r\n\r\nIt was Henry Myers who spoke.\r\n\r\nGill was bewildered; the hubbub about him increasing his confusion.\r\n\r\n\"I will sleep in the bed of the river,\" he replied with a laugh. Then\r\nseeing Bill Kellar, he continued: \"Take me home with you, Bill; fiddle\r\nup the devil and get him to grab me.\"\r\n\r\nHis humiliation was complete.\r\n\r\nHenry gave him a push, and he walked along meekly, Hunch following close\r\nto his heels, and the crowd straggling after.\r\n\r\nWithout a word to any one Lizzi went to her room, which with the door\r\nclosed became a holy place, where Grief was high-priest. Peter McAnay\r\nclimbed the stairs softly and listened outside the door. The only sound\r\nhe heard was the light tapping of her heel on the floor as she danced\r\nthe baby on her knee.\r\n\r\nLevi escorted Parson Lawrence to Seth Reed's house, and Blind Benner\r\nsought his home.\r\n\r\nMatthi and Cassi went aimlessly out into the streets. Their oath had not\r\nbeen kept: Gill had escaped without punishment from them. They had not\r\nsettled with him, because the Queen had forbidden them to harm him. Had\r\nthey met him on the street, they would have stood aside, accepting the\r\nsituation, while they thirsted for his blood.\r\n\r\nOn his way home from Seth Reed's, Levi stopped at Squire Harker's. From\r\nthat official he learned of the bargain made by him and Gill in the\r\nshoe-shop. With this information to impart, Levi called on Squire\r\nParsons and advised him to ride immediately to Squire Barton and procure\r\na warrant for the arrest of both Squire Harker and Gill. Squire Parsons\r\nacted on the suggestion, and by midnight was far up the Boomer Creek\r\nroad. The night was far spent when, warrant in hand, he set out to\r\nreturn to Three-Sisters. He rode hard, hoping to reach the village by\r\ndaybreak. About a mile from the town his horse stumbled over a loose\r\nplank on a Boomer Creek bridge, and lamed himself so badly that the\r\nSquire was compelled to walk.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLizzi rose early after a sleepless night, and taking the boy downstairs\r\nplaced him in the cradle. He was sound asleep, and the noise she made in\r\nbuilding a fire in the stove did not disturb him.\r\n\r\nWhile the fire was catching she sat with her elbows resting on her knees\r\nand her hands clasped before her. Presently the sound of many feet\r\nmarching in measured tread reached her. It grew more distinct, then\r\nceased for a moment, was heard again, growing gradually fainter. She\r\nlistened to it as if in a stupor, while the bacon sizzled meaningly in\r\nthe skillet and the tea-kettle hummed a busy tune.\r\n\r\nA surly, resolute crowd was leading John Gillfillan to the bridge to\r\nhang him. At first the intention was to lynch him before the Block, but\r\nsome of the men urged in opposition to this plan that it would be too\r\nhard on Lizzi when she should learn that he had been killed in front of\r\nher door and she unable to prevent it because she was ignorant of it.\r\nTheir counsel prevailed, and the bridge was decided upon as the place of\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\nBill Kellar, assisted by Hunch, had told Henry Myers, who had recently\r\nbeen elected constable, and the constantly increasing crowd, the history\r\nof the search for Gill, and how at last Blind Benner had discovered him.\r\nFor a conclusion to the narration, the dwarf gave a graphic description\r\nof as much as he had witnessed of the scene when Lizzi learned of Gill's\r\nperfidy and refused to be party to a second marriage ceremony with him.\r\n\r\n\"Yer orter be hung, damn yer!\" Henry Myers fairly yelled, as he shook\r\nhis fist in Gill's face.\r\n\r\n\"There's no telling but he fired the store fer ter kill hisself,\r\nforgettin' us poor folks thet might hev starved.\"\r\n\r\nThis suggestion of a burly teamster became as it passed from lip to lip\r\nan assertion, and violently-excited men surrounded Gill, charging him\r\nwith incendiarism and daring him to deny the accusation. He was very\r\nwhite, but cool and quiet, neither defying them nor asking mercy at\r\ntheir hands. A grim sort of submission was expressed by his face as he\r\nstood against the wall of the little room and waited for a decision of\r\nthe mob as to his punishment. When at last it was resolved to lynch him\r\nhe betrayed no fear, and the crowd, awed by his calmness, became sullen.\r\nLoud tones gave place to surly growls that indicated inflexible\r\ndetermination to perform an act of justice that should both be a\r\nvengeance on the culprit--for not a man was present who had not fully\r\nconvinced himself that Gill had set fire to the store--and a warning to\r\nall incendiaries of the fate that would be theirs if they should be so\r\nunfortunate as to be captured. A rope was procured, and a noose made in\r\nit, which was thrown over Gill's neck. Then he was led away to the\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBlind Benner had coughed almost incessantly from the time he went to\r\nbed, and at last in desperation rose. Dressing himself he sat down in a\r\nchair near the kitchen stove, in which the fire still smouldered. The\r\nchange of posture gave him relief, and he fell asleep. The tread of the\r\nmen passing the Block with Gill aroused him. Listening to the heavy,\r\nregular footfalls, and not hearing a voice, he feared he was dreaming.\r\nCreeping to the door, he opened it. The cold air rushing in started his\r\ncough and convinced him that he was awake. Struggling for a moment with\r\nthe cough, he overcame it, and, impelled by a vague alarm, went down the\r\nporch steps. Pausing a moment, he listened again. The footsteps seemed\r\nfar away. Groping his way to the end of the Block, he went into Big-bug\r\nAvenue, where he could hear them more plainly; yet they were going away\r\nfrom him towards the bridge.\r\n\r\nHis determination was taken at once, and rapidly he followed the crowd.\r\nRunning recklessly, and keeping as near the middle of the street as he\r\ncould, he stumbled often and at last fell. He rose quickly, not minding\r\nthe pain, took one step and stopped, brought to a halt by an obstacle on\r\nwhich he placed his hands.\r\n\r\n\"It's the horse-block,\" he exclaimed joyfully, patting it\r\naffectionately, as he would a friend.\r\n\r\nIt was a friend indeed--a guide.\r\n\r\nLeaving it, he went ahead slowly, swinging his arms and reaching as far\r\nas he could, pausing at every step. Presently the tips of his fingers\r\ntouched something. Going nearer, he found he was beside a post, which he\r\nfelt eagerly as if searching for some mark by which to know it. He found\r\ntwo rings hanging one above the other from staples driven into the wood.\r\n\r\nLeaning against the post, he listened. A cold breeze blew over him, and\r\nhe shivered, coughing in spite of the hand that covered his mouth. He\r\nhoped to hear some one speak, but nothing reached his ears from the\r\nbridge but the trampling of heavy boots on the floor. Again the wind\r\nblew, harder this time, and he coughed louder; but if he was heard, no\r\none heeded him. A creaking sound came from above him, but he did not\r\nneed the rasping screech of the sign on its rusty hinges to inform him\r\nthat he was in front of the tavern. Listening a moment longer, he patted\r\nthe post as he had done the horse-block, and stole towards the bridge.\r\nSoon from the remark of a man on the outskirts of the crowd he learned\r\nwhat was to be done.\r\n\r\n\"Heng Gill,\" he repeated in a whisper, half joyfully, wholly willing\r\nthat it should be done. Then came the thought,\r\n\r\n\"But Lizzi would rether they wouldn't.\"\r\n\r\nWith eager, impatient search, he tried to find the sign-post to guide\r\nhim towards the Block, where he had decided to go and tell her what was\r\nhappening. Reach out as he would, he could not touch the post, and he\r\nbegan running in circles, striking out with his hands like a madman.\r\n\r\n\"Hunchy! Hunchy!\" he called, but his voice was weak, and he was not\r\nheard.\r\n\r\nWhen he was almost exhausted he struck a tree with his arm. Pausing a\r\nsecond to feel the bark, he went quickly around it and stumbled over the\r\nboard walk in front of Colonel Hornberger's house. Then he knew the way.\r\nThe board walk passed the Block. He ran on it fast as he could, and\r\nburst in upon Lizzi as she sat before the fire with her face buried in\r\nher hands.\r\n\r\nBetween gasps for breath he began to tell his story, while his head\r\nresounded with whirring noises and his temples throbbed as if they would\r\nburst.\r\n\r\n\"Mind the baby, Benner,\" she called to him from the porch before he had\r\nfinished.\r\n\r\nA wail from the infant directed him to the cradle. Kneeling beside it,\r\nhe struggled with his cough and rocked the crying child.\r\n\r\nWhen the lynchers entered the bridge, Henry Myers climbed up to one of\r\nthe cross-pieces. The end of the rope was thrown to him, and he made it\r\nfast. Then Gill was placed on a chair.\r\n\r\n\"Yer hev got ter die, John Gillfillan, an' yer may as well make a clean\r\nbreast uv it,\" said Henry, his feet dangling not far from Gill's head.\r\n\r\nThe sullen faces of the angry men did not seem to frighten Gill, who\r\ncould see them plainly in the light of several stable-lanterns\r\ndistributed through the crowd. The rope pressed against his neck, but\r\nhis hands were unbound.\r\n\r\n\"We'll give yer three minits ter make up yer mind, not as we've got enny\r\ndoubts 'bout yer guilt, but we think yer might die easier hevin' told\r\nthe truth onct in yer life.\"\r\n\r\nHenry took a bull's-eye watch from his vest-pocket and asked for a\r\nlantern. By its light he grimly watched the hands.\r\n\r\nThe silence in the bridge was so intense that Gill could hear the watch\r\ntick, and the sounds of Blind Benner's feet striking the board walk as\r\nhe ran to Lizzi were borne to the ears of the crowd.\r\n\r\nAt last Henry said:\r\n\r\n\"Yer hev jist got a quarter uv a minit, Gill.\"\r\n\r\nClearing his throat, Gill made a sign with his hand that he was going to\r\nspeak. The men came closer to him, and Henry put his watch away.\r\n\r\n\"I guess I ought to tell. I did set fire to the store because I wanted\r\nto get rid of the books. I meant to get out in time through the window;\r\nwas just going to open it and jump when I heard Lizzi\"--his voice\r\nfaltered a little--\"call for help and her axe strike the door\r\ndownstairs. Then I thought I'd let her save me. You know how she pulled\r\nme out, but you didn't know that I was pretending I was overcome with\r\nthe smoke.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why did yer want ter burn the books?\" asked Thomas Myers.\r\n\r\n\"Because I had been stealing from Colonel Hornberger, and couldn't have\r\nhid it much longer.\"\r\n\r\nHe was very calm, but his face was blanched.\r\n\r\n\"Yer kin say yer prayers ef yer want ter,\" said Henry.\r\n\r\n\"Guess they wouldn't be much good,\" Gill remarked with a wan smile.\r\n\r\n\"Then tie his arms, Tom.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNear the bridge Lizzi stopped suddenly, her impetuous rush to save\r\nGill's life checked by the thought to which she gave utterance in a\r\nwhisper:\r\n\r\n\"I know my shame.\"\r\n\r\nShe had not known it when she ran to rescue him from death in the store\r\nfire; she had not learned it when she faced unflinchingly the scorn of\r\nthe women; and she was ignorant of it when she dashed into the bar-room\r\nto stop the fight her brothers made in defence of her good name: but now\r\nit was upon her with crushing weight, and she stood helpless in sight of\r\nthe rope that was to strangle Gill.\r\n\r\nIf she would save him it behooved her to act quickly, for she could see\r\na man pinioning his arms. Moved with great pity for her betrayer, whose\r\nwhite face she could see plainly, she summoned strength to enter the\r\nbridge.\r\n\r\nAs she stepped on the planks she was conscious of a change in the manner\r\nof the crowd, and seeing Squire Parsons force his way to Gill's side,\r\npaused.\r\n\r\n\"Henry Myers!\" called the squire.\r\n\r\n\"Here,\" answered Henry from the cross-piece.\r\n\r\n\"I have a warrant for the arrest of John Gillfillan issued to you as\r\nconstable, and you must take him in charge.\"\r\n\r\nLaw had entered the crowd, and its presence was immediately recognized\r\nby submission. Henry dropped to the bridge-floor and muttered a curse as\r\nhe addressed the squire:\r\n\r\n\"Yer hev spoiled a good job; ef yer'd b'en a minit later the devil'd hed\r\nGill, sure.\"\r\n\r\nLizzi, seeing Gill would not be injured, turned and fled through the\r\ndarkness to the refuge of her home.\r\n\r\nShe entered it with bowed head, her queenliness having gone from her\r\nforever.\r\n\r\nThe child was crying petulantly. Blind Benner, lying on the floor,\r\nsupported his head with one hand and feebly rocked the cradle with the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nA pool of blood lay on the white quilt that covered the infant, and\r\nanother was forming on the floor under the cradle.\r\n\r\nThe child wailed as the cradle rocked slowly and unevenly.\r\n\r\nThe blood flowed noiselessly from Blind Benner's lips. He knew Lizzi had\r\ncome back, but he would not speak until she did. He was afraid to know\r\nwhat had happened in the bridge, and would die in ignorance, obeying her\r\nlast command to him.\r\n\r\nWith eyes cast down she moved slowly towards the cradle. The blood on\r\nthe quilt was lighted by the unsteady flame of the candle. Suddenly she\r\nsaw the scarlet pool. Her head swam and she sank on her knees. Taking\r\nthe blind man's head impulsively yet tenderly in her hands, she laid it\r\nagainst her heart, bursting with this new grief.\r\n\r\nSoothed by the mother's presence or frightened by the nearness of Death,\r\nthe infant ceased its wail.\r\n\r\nThe cradle stood still.\r\n\r\nBut the red stream flowed rapidly, while Blind Benner nervously and\r\nweakly took from his vest-pocket a piece of crumpled paper and handed it\r\nto Lizzi.\r\n\r\nShe smoothed it and read, while Blind Benner clung to her neck.\r\n\r\n     \"_Too Hoom it may consern._\r\n\r\n     I leeve all my Sirkus munny to Lizzi an' my fiddel to her boy.\r\n\r\n         BLIND BENNER,\r\n         his X mark.\r\n\r\n         Wittness\r\n             HUNCH.\"\r\n\r\nShe kissed him on the lips wet with blood.\r\n\r\nHis head fell. The hemorrhage had been very profuse, and she saw the\r\ndeath-pallor on his cheek. Soon he raised his head, and with his lips\r\nclose to her ear whispered:\r\n\r\n\"I kin soon see yer, Lizzi.\"\r\n\r\nEver after that he was silent.\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Note:\r\n\r\nIn the original Lizzi used a macron over the final 'i'.
