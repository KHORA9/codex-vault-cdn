The economics, the politics, the\r\ngeopolitics, the conspiracies, the corruption, the old and the new, the\r\nplough and the internet - it is all here, in prose, as provocative and\r\nvitriolic and loving and longing as I could make it.\r\n\r\nFrom \"The Mind of Darkness\":\r\n\r\n\"'The Balkans' - I say - 'is the unconscious of the world'. People stop\r\nto digest this metaphor and then they nod enthusiastically. It is here\r\nthat the repressed memories of history, its traumas and fears and\r\nimages reside. It is here that the psychodynamics of humanity - the\r\ntectonic clash between Rome and Byzantium, West and East,\r\nJudeo-Christianity and Islam - is still easily discernible. We are\r\nseated at a New Year's dining table, loaded with a roasted pig and\r\nexotic salads.\r\n\r\nI, the Jew, only half foreign to this cradle of Slavonics. Four Serbs,\r\nfive Macedonians. It is in the Balkans that all ethnic distinctions\r\nfail and it is here that they prevail anachronistically and\r\natavistically. Contradiction and change the only two fixtures of this\r\ntormented region.\r\n\r\nThe women of the Balkan - buried under provocative mask-like make up,\r\nretro hairstyles and too narrow dresses. The men, clad in sepia\r\ncolours, old fashioned suits and turn of the century moustaches. In the\r\nbackground there is the crying game that is Balkanian music: liturgy\r\nand folk and elegy combined. The smells are heavy with musk-ular\r\nperfumes. It is like time travel. It is like revisiting one's\r\nchildhood.\"\r\n\r\nHow were the articles and essays contained herein - many of them\r\ntranslated and published in local languages - received by people\r\neverywhere?\r\n\r\nMy readers from the Balkans reacted to these essays with an admixture\r\nof rage and indignation. They erected defensive barricades of\r\nself-aggrandizement and of my devaluation. And they let their ingrained\r\nparanoia run rampant (Jewish conspiracies, Western spies, world plots).\r\nI asked a resident of this tortured region to write the foreword to\r\nthis book. People from other parts, from Central and Eastern Europe,\r\nwere more argumentative and contemplating, though much less passionate.\r\nAnd Westerners - especially those with interest in these regions of the\r\nworld - reacted with great, cathartic enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nIn reading this book, I wish upon you the joy and the revulsion, the\r\ndark fascination of this region and its surrealist dreams and\r\nnightmares. This is what I experience daily here and it is my hope that\r\nI succeeded to convey the siren's song, the honeyed trap, the lure and\r\nthe allure of this tortured corner of the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Sam Vaknin\r\n\r\nSkopje, February 2000\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the Rain\r\n\r\nHow the West\r\n\r\nLost the East\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe PEOPLE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Author of this Article is a Racist\r\n\r\nOr, so say many of the readers, who react vehemently - not to say\r\nminaciously - to my articles. They insist that I demonise, chastise,\r\ndisparage, deride and hold in contempt groups of people simply and\r\nsolely because they are born in a given geographical area or are of a\r\ngiven genetic stock. Few stop sufficiently long to notice that the\r\nabove two accusations contravene each other. A territory as vast as CEE\r\ncannot and is not inhabited by one \"race\". It is an historical cocktail\r\nof colours and origins and languages and bloodlines. Disregarding the\r\npan-Slavic myth for a minute, a racist would find the CEE a very\r\ndiscouraging neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nAm I a racist? If this is taken to mean \"do I believe in the inherent\r\ninferiority or malevolence or impurity of any group of people (however\r\narbitrarily defined or capriciously delimited) just because of their\r\ncommon origin or habitation\" - then of course I am not. I am not an\r\nadherent of genetic predetermination and I think that there is very\r\nlittle point in discussing fictitious entities such as \"pure races\".\r\nThat people are what they are made out to be by their up-bringing,\r\nsociety, and history and by the reactions of other humans to them - is\r\nwhat I subscribe to.\r\n\r\nYet I do believe in the temporary inferiority, malevolence and impurity\r\nof groups of people who experienced and were subjected to prolonged\r\ncorrupting and pathologising influences. Historical processes exact an\r\nexorbitant toll. Ideologies, indoctrination, totalitarianism,\r\nauthoritarianism, command economies, statism, militarism, malignant\r\nnationalism, occupation - all carry a hefty price tag. And the currency\r\nis the mind of the people: their mental health, their socialization\r\nprocesses and, ultimately, the social fabric. Beneath a thin veneer of\r\nkultur - the masses were savaged, the individual was crushed into a\r\nmoral pulp. I do believe in mass pathology: mass hysteria, mass\r\npersonality disorders, mass psychoses. I do believe in common\r\ndepravity, all-pervasive venality and inescapable subornation of whole\r\nsocieties and of each of the individuals who comprise them. I do\r\nbelieve in the osmosis of evil, in the diffusion of villainy, in the\r\ncorruption of the soul. In short: I do believe in terminally sick\r\nsocieties, whose prospects of recovery are nil. The only hope lies in\r\ntheir demise. Not in the abstract sense of the word - but in the actual\r\ndeath and decomposition of each and every individual until the whole\r\n\"generation of the desert\" is done with and a new, less contaminated\r\none, emerges to take its place.\r\n\r\nThis is why I believe that the future of Africa, the Middle East and\r\nthe countries of the CEE and NIS is, for the time being, behind them.\r\nTheir horizon is dim and empty. They are looking forward to the past.\r\nThey are the zombies of the international arena, the walking dead and\r\nit is death that they multiply. Their growth is stunted, their speech\r\nis stifled, their leaders a vicious lot, the states that they inhabit\r\nare dens of barbarous criminality and lawlessness. Their institutions\r\nare a travesty, their parties nests of avarice and vile. Their media\r\nprostituted and defiled. The farce of elections and the newspeak of\r\ndemocracy and human rights and freemarketry are props to hide the vast\r\nwilderness of moral bankruptcy. These are Potemkin states run by\r\nChicago mobs. Instruments of extortion and coercion no different to\r\ntheir predecessors - only they provide less security, both physical and\r\neconomic. They know no different. They think no different. They swear\r\nby their malaise and by their malaise they shall die.\r\n\r\nAnd die they shall. The signs are auspicious. Biology, the West and\r\ninternational financial institutions all conspire to retire the beast.\r\nNew blood, new ideas, new hopes and aspirations are in evidence. Still\r\noverwhelmed by the abrupt and cruel exposure of their elders, still\r\ntaken aback by the enormity of the project of rehabilitating the very\r\npsyche of their people, still torn between illegal self enrichment and\r\nservice to their fellow citizens - but there they are, the young ones.\r\nThe battle is on. The consensus of the baksheesh and the political\r\nassassination is replaced, ever so gradually, by the dissension of the\r\nmarket place. Wars are fought with spreadsheets, experience imported\r\nfrom afar, new knowledge craved, corruption decried. It is a\r\nrefreshing, gargantuan, change. And it will consume yet one more\r\ngeneration. But it has started and it is irreversible. And it is in the\r\neyes of the youth, a flickering flame, so ephemeral, so vulnerable and\r\nyet, so irresistible. This flame is called the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Article written on January 15, 2000 and published January 31, 2000\r\n\r\nin \"Central Europe Review\" volume 2, issue 4)\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Caveman and the Alien\r\n\r\n\"'Life' must be curious, alert, erudite and moral, but it must achieve\r\nthis without being holier-than-thou, a cynic, a know-it-all or a\r\nPeeping Tom.\"\r\n\r\n(Edward K. Thompson, managing editor of \"Life\", 1949-1961)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Chancellor Kohl's party and Edith Cresson are suspected of gross\r\ncorruption - these are labelled \"aberrations\" in an otherwise honest\r\nWest. When NASA in collaboration with its UK counterpart blow a 130\r\nmillion US dollars spacecraft to smithereens having confused the metric\r\nsystem for its pound/feet archaic predecessor - people nod their head\r\nin disapproval: \"accidents happen\". When President Clinton appoints his\r\nwife to suggest an overhaul of the multi-hundred billion dollars US\r\nhealth system - no one thinks it odd. And when the (talented) son of\r\nthe police investigated, rumoured to be hyper-corrupt Minister of\r\nInterior Affairs of Israel becomes a Minister himself, no one bats an\r\neyelash. Yet, when identical events happen in the decrepit countries of\r\nEastern, Central, or Southern Europe - they are subjected to heaps of\r\nexcoriating scorn, to vitriolic diatribes, to condescending preaching,\r\nor to sanctions. It is, indeed, a double standard, a hypocrisy and a\r\ntravesty the magnitude of which is rarely to be encountered in the\r\nannals of human pretensions to morality.\r\n\r\nThe West has grossly and thoroughly violated Thompson's edict. In its\r\noft-interrupted intercourse with these forsaken regions of the globe,\r\nit has acted, alternately, as a Peeping Tom, a cynic and a know it all.\r\nIt has invariably behaved as if it were holier-than-thou. In an\r\nunmitigated and fantastic succession of blunders, miscalculations, vain\r\npromises, unkept threats and unkempt diplomats - it has driven Europe\r\nto the verge of war and the region it \"adopted\" to the verge of\r\neconomic and social upheaval.\r\n\r\nEnamoured with the new ideology of free marketry cum democracy, the\r\nWest first assumed the role of the omniscient. It designed ingenious\r\nmodels, devised foolproof laws, imposed fail-safe institutions and\r\nstrongly \"recommended\" measures. Its representatives, the tribunes of\r\nthe West, ruled the plebeian East with determination rarely equalled by\r\nskill or knowledge. Velvet hands couched in iron gloves, ignorance\r\ndisguised by economic newspeak, geostrategic interests masquerading as\r\nforms of government characterized their dealings with the natives.\r\nPreaching and beseeching from ever-higher pulpits, they poured\r\nopprobrium and sweet delusions on the eagerly deluded, naive,\r\nbewildered masses. The deceit was evident to the indigenous cynics -\r\nbut it was the failure that dissuaded them and all else. The West lost\r\nEastern and Southeast Europe not when it lied egregiously, not when it\r\npretended to know for sure when it surely did not know, not when it\r\nmanipulated and coaxed and coerced - but when it failed. To the peoples\r\nof these regions, the king was fully dressed. It was not a little child\r\nbut an enormous debacle that exposed his nudity. In its\r\npresumptuousness and pretentiousness, feigned surety and vain clichés,\r\nimported models and exported cheap raw materials - the West succeeded\r\nto demolish beyond reconstruction whole economies, to ravage\r\ncommunities, to bring ruination upon the centuries-old social fabric,\r\nwoven diligently by generations. It brought crime and drugs and mayhem\r\nbut gave very little in return, only a horizon beclouded and thundering\r\nwith eloquence. As a result, while tottering regional governments still\r\npay lip service to the Euro-Atlantic structures, the masses are enraged\r\nand restless and rebellious and baleful and anti-Western to the core.\r\nThey are not likely to acquiesce much longer - not with the West's\r\nneo-colonialism but with its incompetence and inaptitude, with the\r\nnonchalant experimentation that it imposed upon them and with the abyss\r\nbetween its proclamations and its performance.\r\n\r\nIn all this time, the envoys of the West - its mediocre politicians,\r\nits insatiably ruthless media, its obese tourists and its armchair\r\neconomists - continued to play the role of God, wreaking greater havoc\r\nthan even the original. While knowing it all in advance (in breach of\r\nevery tradition scientific), they also developed a kind of world weary,\r\nunshaven cynicism interlaced with fascination at the depths plumbed by\r\nthe local's immorality and amorality. The jet-set Peeping Toms resided\r\nin five star hotels (or luxurious apartments) overlooking the communist\r\nshantytowns, drove utility vehicles to the shabby offices of the native\r\nbureaucrats and dined in $100 per meal restaurants (\"it's so cheap\r\nhere\"). In between sushi and sake they bemoaned and grieved over\r\ncorruption and nepotism and cronyism (\"I simply love their ethnic food,\r\nbut they are so...\"). They mourned the autochtonal inability to act\r\ndecisively, to cut red tape, to manufacture quality, to open to the\r\nworld, to be less xenophobic (while casting a disdainful glance at the\r\nsweaty waiter). To them it looked like an ancient natural phenomenon, a\r\nforce of nature, an inevitability and hence their cynicism. Mostly\r\nprovincial people with horizons limited by consumption and by wealth,\r\nthey adopted cynicism as shorthand for cosmopolitanism. They\r\nerroneously believed it lent them an air of ruggedness and rich\r\nexperience and the virile aroma of decadent erudition. Yet all it did\r\nis make them obnoxious and more repellent to the residents than they\r\nalready were.\r\n\r\nEver the preachers, the West - both Europeans and Americans - upheld\r\nthemselves as role models of virtue to be emulated, as points of\r\nreference, almost inhuman or superhuman in their taming of the vices,\r\navarice up front. Yet the disorder in their own homes was broadcast\r\nlive, day in and day out, into the cubicles inhabited by the very\r\npeople they sought to so transform. And they conspired and collaborated\r\nin all manner of corruption and crime and scam and rigged elections in\r\nall the countries they put the gospel to. In trying to put an end to\r\nhistory, they seem to have provoked another round of it - more vicious,\r\nmore enduring, more traumatic than before. That the West will pay the\r\nprice for its mistakes I have no doubt. For isn't it a part and parcel\r\nof their teaching that everything has a price and that there is always\r\na time of reckoning?\r\n\r\n\r\n(Article written on November 23, 1999 and published December 6, 1999\r\n\r\nin \"Central Europe Review\" volume 1, issue 24)\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs Transition Possible?\r\n\r\n\r\nCan Socialist Professors of Economics\r\n\r\nTeach Capitalism?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLest you hold your breath to the end of this article - the answers to\r\nboth questions in the title are no and no. Capitalism cannot be\r\n\"learned\" or \"imported\" or \"emulated\" or \"simulated\". Capitalism (or,\r\nrather, liberalism) is not only a theoretical construct. It is not only\r\na body of knowledge. It is a philosophy, an ideology, a way of life, a\r\nmentality and a personality.\r\n\r\nThis is why professors of economics who studied under Socialism can\r\nnever teach Capitalism in the truest sense of the word. No matter how\r\nintelligent and knowledgeable (and a minority of them are) - they can\r\nnever convey the experience, the practice, the instincts and reflexes,\r\nthe emotional hues and intellectual pugilistics that real, full scale,\r\nfull-blooded Capitalism entails. They are intellectually and\r\nemotionally castrated by their socialist past of close complicity with\r\ninefficiency, corruption and pathological economic thinking.\r\n\r\nThis is why workers and managers inherited from the socialist-communist\r\nperiod can never function properly in a Capitalist ambience. Both were\r\ntrained at civil disobedience through looting their own state and\r\nfactories. Both grew accustomed to state handouts and bribes disguised\r\nas entitlements were suspicious and envious at their own elites\r\n(especially their politicians and crony professors), victims to\r\nsuppressed rage and open, helpless and degrading dependence. Such\r\nworkers and managers - no matter how well intentioned and well\r\nqualified or skilled - are likely to sabotage the very efforts whose\r\nlivelihood depends on.\r\n\r\nWhen the transition period of post-communist economies started,\r\nacademics, journalists and politicians in the West talked about the\r\n\"pent up energies\" of the masses, now to be released through the twin\r\nprocesses of privatisation and democratisation. This metaphor of humans\r\nas capitalistically charged batteries waiting to unleash their stored\r\nenergy upon their lands - was realistic enough. People were, indeed,\r\ncharged: with pathological envy, with rage, with sadism, with\r\npusillanimity, with urges to sabotage, to steal, and to pilfer. A\r\ntsunami of destruction, a tidal wave of misappropriation, an orgy of\r\ncrime and corruption and nepotism and cronyism swept across the\r\nunfortunate territories of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). Transition\r\nwas perceived by the many either as a new venue for avenging the past\r\nand for visiting the wrath of the masses upon the heads of the elites -\r\nor as another, accelerated, mode of stripping the state naked of all\r\nits assets. Finally, the latter propensity prevailed. The old elites\r\nused the cover of transition to enrich themselves and their cronies,\r\nthis time \"transparently\" and \"legally\". The result was a repulsive\r\nmalignant metastasis of capitalism, devoid of the liberal ideals or\r\npractices, denuded of ethics, floating in a space free of functioning,\r\ntrusted institutions.\r\n\r\nWhile the masses and their elites in CEE were busy scavenging, the West\r\nengaged in impotent debate between a school of \"shock therapists\" and a\r\nschool of \"institution builders\". The former believed that appearances\r\nwill create reality and that reality will alter consciousness (sounds\r\nlike Marxism to me). Rapid privatisation will generate a class of\r\ninstant capitalists who, in turn, will usher in an era of real,\r\nmulti-dimensional liberalism. The latter believed that the good wine of\r\nCapitalism could be poured only to the functioning receptacles of\r\nliberalism. They advocated much longer transition periods in which\r\nprivatisation will come only after the proper institutions were\r\nerected. Both indulged in a form of central planning. IMF-ism replaced\r\nCommunism. The international financial institutions and their hordes of\r\nwell-paid, well-accommodated experts - replaced the Central Committee\r\nof the party. Washington replaced Moscow. It was all very familiar and\r\ncosy.\r\n\r\nEver the adapters, the former communist elites converted to ardent\r\ncapitalism. With the fervour with which they recited Marxist slogans in\r\ntheir past - they chanted capitalist sobriquets in the present. It was\r\ncatechism, uttered soullessly, in an alien language, in the marble\r\ncathedrals of capitalism in London and Washington. There was commitment\r\nor conviction behind it and it was tainted by organized crime and\r\nall-pervasive corruption. The West was the new regime to be suckered\r\nand looted and pillaged and drained. The deal was simple: mumble the\r\nmantras of the West, establish Potemkin institutions, keep peace and\r\norder in your corner of the world, give the West strategic access to\r\nyour territory. In return the West will turn a blind eye to the worst\r\nexcesses and to worse than excesses. This was the deal struck in Russia\r\nwith the \"reformists\", in Yugoslavia with Milosevic, the \"peacemaker\",\r\nin the Czech Republic with Klaus the \"economic magician\" of Central\r\nEurope. It was communism all over: a superpower buying influence and\r\ncolluding with corrupt elites to rob their own nations blind.\r\n\r\nIt could have been different.\r\n\r\nPost-war Japan and Germany are two examples of the right kind of\r\nreconstruction and reforms. Democracy took real root in these two\r\nformer military regimes. Economic prosperity was long lived because\r\ndemocracy took hold. And the ever tenuous, ever important trust between\r\nthe citizens and their rulers and among themselves was thus enhanced.\r\n\r\nTrust is really the crux of the matter. Economy is called the dismal\r\nscience because it pretends to be one, disguising its uncertainties and\r\nshifting fashions with mathematical formulae. Economy describes the\r\naggregate behaviour of humans and, in this restricted sense, it is a\r\nbranch of psychology. People operate within a marketplace and attach\r\nvalues to their goods and services and to their inputs (work, capital,\r\nnatural endowments) through the price mechanism. This elaborate\r\nconstruct, however, depends greatly on trust. If people were not to\r\ntrust each other and/or the economic framework (within which they\r\ninteract) - economic activities would have gradually ground to a halt.\r\nA clear inverse relationship exists between the general trust level and\r\nthe level of economic activity. There are four major types of trust:\r\n\r\na. Trust related to Intent - the market players assume that other\r\nplayers are (generally) rational, that they have intentions, that these\r\nintentions conform to the maximization of benefits and that people are\r\nlikely to act on their intentions;\r\n\r\nb. Trust related to Liquidity - the market players assume that\r\nother players possess or have access, or will possess, or will have\r\naccess to the liquid means needed in order to materialize their\r\nintentions and that - barring force majeure - this liquidity is the\r\ndriving force behind the formation of these intentions. People in\r\npossession of liquidity wish to maximize the returns on their money and\r\nare driven to economically transact;\r\n\r\nc. Trust related to knowledge and ability - the market players\r\nassume that other players possess or have access to, or will possess,\r\nor will have access to the know-how, technology and intellectual\r\nproperty and wherewithal necessary to materialize their intention (and,\r\nby implication, the transactions that they enter into). Another\r\nassumption is that all the players are \"enabled\": physically, mentally,\r\nlegally and financially available and capable to perform their parts as\r\nagreed between the players in each and every particular transaction. A\r\nhidden assumption is that the players evaluate themselves properly:\r\nthat they know their strengths and weaknesses, that they have a\r\nbalanced picture of themselves and realistic set of expectations,\r\nself-esteem and self-confidence to support that worldview (including a\r\nmatching track record). Some allowance is made for \"game theory\"\r\ntactics: exaggeration, disinformation, even outright deception - but\r\nthis allowance should not overshadow the merits of the transaction and\r\nits inherent sincerity;\r\n\r\nd. Trust related to the Economic horizon and context - the market\r\nplayers assume that the market will continue to exist as an inert\r\nsystem, unhindered by external factors (governments, geopolitics,\r\nglobal crises, changes in accounting policies, hyperinflation, new\r\ntaxation - anything that could deflect the trajectory of the market).\r\nThey, therefore, have an \"investment or economic horizon\" to look\r\nforward to and upon which they can base their decisions. They also have\r\ncultural, legal, technological and political contexts within which to\r\noperate. The underlying assumptions of stability are very much akin to\r\nthe idealized models that scientists study in the accurate sciences\r\n(indeed, in economy as well).\r\n\r\nWhen one or more of these basic building blocks of trust is fractured\r\nthat the whole edifice of the market crumbles. Fragmentation ensues,\r\nmore social and psychological than economic in nature. This is very\r\ntypical of poor countries with great social and economic polarization.\r\nIt is also very typical of countries \"in transition\" (a polite way to\r\ndescribe a state of total shock and confusion). People adopt several\r\nreaction patterns to the breakdown in trust:\r\n\r\na. Avoidance and isolation - they avoid contact with other people\r\nand adopt reclusive behaviour. The number of voluntary interactions\r\ndecreases sharply;\r\n\r\nb. Corruption - People prefer shortcuts to economic benefits\r\nbecause of the collapse of the horizon trust (=they see no long term\r\nfuture and even doubt the very continued existence of the system);\r\n\r\nc. Crime - Criminal activity increases;\r\n\r\nd. Fantastic and Grandiose delusions to compensate for a growing\r\nsense of uncertainty and fear and for a complex of inferiority. This\r\nnagging feeling of inferiority is the result of the internalisation of\r\nthe image of the people in their own eyes and in the eyes of others.\r\nThis is a self-reinforcing mechanism (vicious circle). The results are\r\nunder-confidence and a handicapped sense of self-esteem. The latter\r\nundulates and fluctuates from overvaluation of one's self and others to\r\ndevaluation of both;\r\n\r\ne. Hypermobility - People are not loyal to the economic cells\r\nwithin which they function. They switch a lot of jobs, for instance, or\r\nignore contracts that they made. The concepts of exclusivity, the\r\nsanctity of promises, loyalty, future, and a career path - all get\r\neroded. As a result, there is no investment in the future (in the\r\nacquisition of skills or in long term investments, to give but two\r\nexamples);\r\n\r\nf. Cognitive Dissonance - The collapse of the social and economic\r\nsystems adversely affects the individual. One of the classic defence\r\nmechanisms is the cognitive dissonance. The person involved tells\r\nhimself that he really chose and wanted his way of life, his decrepit\r\nenvironment, his low standard of living, etc. (\"We are poor because we\r\nchose not to be like the inhuman West\");\r\n\r\ng. The Pathological Envy - The Cognitive Dissonance is often\r\ncoupled with a pathological envy (as opposed to benign jealousy). This\r\nis a destructive type of envy, which seeks to deprive others of their\r\nsuccesses and possessions. It is very typical of societies with a\r\ngrossly unequal distribution of wealth;\r\n\r\nh. The Mentality (or the Historical) Defences - these are defence\r\nmechanisms, which make use of an imagined mentality problem (\"we are\r\nlike that, we have been like this for ages now, nothing to do, we are\r\ndeformed\") - or build upon some historical pattern, or invented pattern\r\n(\"we have been enslaved and submissive for five centuries - what can\r\nyou expect\");\r\n\r\ni. The Passive-Aggressive reaction: occurs mainly when the market\r\nplayers have no access to more legitimate and aggressive venues of\r\nreacting to their predicament or when they are predisposed to\r\nsuppressing of aggression (or when they elect to not express it). The\r\npassive-aggressive reactions are \"sabotage\"-type reactions: slowing\r\ndown of the work, \"working by the book\", absenteeism, stealing from the\r\nworkplace, fostering and maintaining bureaucratic procedures and so on;\r\n\r\nj. The inability to postpone satisfaction - The players regress to\r\na child-like state, demanding immediate satisfaction, unable to\r\npostpone it and getting frustrated, aggressive and deceiving if they\r\nare required to do so by circumstances. They engage in short term\r\nactivities, some criminal, some dubious, some legitimate: trading and\r\nspeculation, gambling, short-termism.\r\n\r\nThe results are, usually, catastrophic: A reduction in economic\r\nactivity, in the number of interactions and in the field of economic\r\npotentials (the product of all possible economic transactions). An\r\nerosion of the human capital, its skills and availability. Brain drain\r\n- skilled people desert, en masse, the fragmented economic system and\r\nmove to more sustainable ones. Resort to illegal and to extra-legal\r\nactivities Social and economic polarization. Interethnic tensions and\r\ntensions between the very rich and the very poor tend to erupt and to\r\nexplode.\r\n\r\nAnd this is where most countries in transition are at right now. To a\r\nlarge extent, it is the fault of their elites. Providing orientation\r\nand guidance is supposed to be their function and why society invests\r\nin them. But the elites in all countries in transition - tainted by\r\nlong years of complicity in the unseemly and the criminal - never\r\nexerted moral or intellectual authority over their people. At the risk\r\nof sounding narcissistic, allow me to quote myself (from \"The Poets and\r\nthe Eclipse\"). Replace \"intellectuals of the Balkan\" with\r\n\"intellectuals of the countries in transition\":\r\n\r\n\r\n(Article written on October 31, 1999 and published November 15, 1999\r\n\r\nin \"Central Europe Review\" volume 1, issue 21)\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Poets and the Eclipse\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPoets in Somalia hold an inordinate sway over the indigenous\r\npopulation. They sing the praises of war with the same alacrity and\r\nvehemence that they invest in glorifying peace. And the population\r\nlistens and follows these dark skinned pied pipers. Lately, they have\r\nbeen extolling peace and peace prevails in Somaliland and the other\r\nstate-like enclaves in this tortured shadow of a country.\r\n\r\nIn the evening we celebrate a birthday party under deciduous trees, in\r\nfloodlit darkness, somewhere in the Balkans. The voices of industrious\r\ncrickets, of late chirping birds, of the cesma - the fabled Balkan\r\nwater fountain - all intermingle to produce an auditory magic. A famous\r\nsatirist and poet catapults slurred, vitriolic diatribes at a guest\r\nfrom the West that I brought with me. His words ring inebriatedly\r\nauthentic. He need not learn the language, he exclaims, of people\r\nwithout a spirit and without a mind. He is referring to English. His\r\ncountry - he triumphantly shrills - is the best, an island of\r\ncivilization among the barbarians at the gates. He enumerates his\r\nneighbours and proceeds to describe in vivid, gut wrenching detail what\r\nhe would do to them all, given the opportunity. \"The rotten core of our\r\nnational apple\" - a melancholy contribution from a professor of\r\npsychiatry.\r\n\r\nAnother day. As the moon bit into the otherwise scorching sun - the\r\nstreets emptied. Shops closed, the traffic halted, workers remained\r\ncooped up in steamy offices. Why all this - I asked my friend. He is a\r\nleading journalist, an author, an editor and a media personality. He\r\nlooked at me warily and proceeded to expound upon the health risks\r\nentailed in being exposed to the eclipse. He was serious as was\r\nevidenced by his subsequent descent into his basement and by the\r\nresounding bolting of the anti-nuclear double plated armoured door. He\r\noffered me to join him and was appalled to hear that I had every\r\nintention of watching the eclipse - and from the street.\r\n\r\nThe intellectuals of the Balkans - a curse, not in disguise, a\r\nnefarious presence, ominous, erratic and corrupt. Sometimes, at the\r\nnucleus of all conflict and mayhem - at other times (of ethnic\r\ncleansing or suppression of the media) conspicuously absent. Zeligs of\r\numpteen disguises and ever changing, shimmering loyalties.\r\n\r\nThey exert no moderating, countervailing influence - on the contrary,\r\nthey radicalise, dramatize, poison and incite. Intellectuals are\r\nprominent among all the nationalist parties in the Balkans - and rare\r\namong the scant centre parties that have recently sprung out of the\r\nashes of communism.\r\n\r\nThey do not disseminate the little, outdated knowledge that they do\r\npossess. Rather they keep it as a guild would, unto themselves,\r\njealously. In the vanity typical of the insecure, they abnegate all\r\nforeign knowledge. They rarely know a second language sufficiently to\r\nread it. They promote their brand of degreed ignorance with religious\r\nzeal and punish all transgressors with fierceness and ruthlessness.\r\nThey are the main barriers to technology transfers and knowledge\r\nenhancement in this wretched region. Their instincts of\r\nself-preservation go against the best interests of their people. Unable\r\nto educate and teach - they prostitute their services, selling degrees\r\nor corrupting themselves in politics. They make up a big part of the\r\npost communist nomenclature as they have a big part of the communist\r\none. The result is economics students who never heard of Milton\r\nFriedman or Kenneth Arrow and students of medicine who offer sex or\r\nmoney or both to their professors in order to graduate.\r\n\r\nThus, instead of advocating and promoting freedom and liberalization -\r\nthey concentrate on the mechanisms of control, on manipulating the worn\r\nlevers of power. They are the dishonest brokers of corrupted\r\npoliticians and their businessmen cronies. They are heavily involved -\r\noft times the initiators - of suppression and repression, especially of\r\nthe mind and of the spirit. The black crows of nationalism perched upon\r\ntheir beleaguered ivory towers.\r\n\r\nThey could have chosen differently. In 1989, the Balkans had a chance\r\nthe likes of which it never had before. In Yugoslavia, the government\r\nof the reformist (though half hearted) Ante Markovic. Elsewhere,\r\nCommunism was gasping for a last breath and the slaughter of the beast\r\nwas at hand. The intellectuals of Central Europe, of the Baltic States\r\n- even of Russia - chose to interpret these events to their people, to\r\nencourage freedom and growth, to posit goals and to motivate. The\r\nintellectuals of the Balkans failed miserably. Terrified by the sights\r\nand sounds of their threatened territory - they succumbed to\r\nobscurantism, resorted to the nostalgic, the abstract and the\r\nfantastic, rather than to the pragmatic. This choice is evident even in\r\ntheir speech. Marred by centuries of cruel outside domination - it is\r\nall but meaningless. No one can understand what a Balkanian has to say.\r\nBoth syntax and grammar are tortured into incomprehensibility. Evasion\r\ndominates, a profusion of obscuring verbal veils, twists and turns\r\nhiding a vacuous deposition.\r\n\r\nThe Balkan intellectuals chose narcissistic self-absorption and navel\r\ngazing over \"other-orientation\". Instead of seeking integration (as\r\ndistinct from assimilation) - they preach and practice isolation. They\r\naim to differentiate themselves not in a pluralistic, benign manner -\r\nbut in vicious, raging defiance of \"mondialism\" (a Serbian propaganda\r\nterm). To define themselves AGAINST all others - rather than to compare\r\nand learn from the comparison. Their love affair with a (mostly\r\nconcocted) past, their future-phobia, and the ensuing culture shock -\r\nall follow naturally from the premises of their disconsolate\r\nuniqueness. Balkan intellectuals are all paranoids. Scratch the\r\nsurface, the thin, bow tied, veneer of \"kultur\" - and you will find an\r\natavistic poet, fighting against the very evil wrought by him and by\r\nhis actions. This is the Greek tragedy of this breathtaking region.\r\nNature here is cleverer than humans. It is exactly their conspiracies\r\nthat bring about the very things they have to conspire against in the\r\nfirst place.\r\n\r\nAll over the world, intellectuals are the vanguard, the fifth column of\r\nnew ideas, the resistance movement against the occupation of the old\r\nand the banal. Here intellectuals preach conformity, doing things the\r\nold, proven way, protectionism against the trade of liberal minds. All\r\nintellectuals here - fed by the long arm of the state - are\r\ncollaborators. True, all hideous regimes had their figleaf\r\nintellectuals and with a few exceptions, the regimes in the Balkans are\r\nnot hideous. But the principle is the same, only the price varies.\r\nProstituting their unique position in semi-literate, village-tribal\r\nsocieties - intellectuals in the Balkans sold out en masse. They are\r\nthe inertial power - rather than the counterfist of reform. They are\r\ninvolved in politics of the wrong and doomed kind. The Balkan would\r\nhave been better off had they decided to remain aloof, detached in\r\ntheir archipelago of universities.\r\n\r\nThere is no real fire in Balkan intellectuals. Oh, they get excited and\r\nthey shout and blush and wave their hands ever so vigorously. But they\r\nare empty. It is full gas in neutral. They get nowhere because they are\r\ngoing nowhere. They are rational and conservative and some are\r\nemotional and \"leftist\". But it is all listless and lifeless, like the\r\npaces of a very old mechanism, set in motion 80 years ago and never\r\nunwound.\r\n\r\nAll that day of the eclipse of the last millennium, even the\r\nintellectuals stayed in their cellars and in their offices and did not\r\ndare venture out. They emerged when night fell, accustomed to the\r\ndarkness, unable to confront their own eclipse, hiding from the evil\r\ninfluence of a re-emerging sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Article written on August 14, 1999 and published August 30, 1999\r\n\r\nin \"Central Europe Review\" volume 1, issue 10)\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rip van Winkle Institutions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe West - naive, provincial and parochial - firmly believed that the\r\nrot was confined to the upper echelons of communist and socialist\r\nsocieties. Beneath the festering elites - the theory went - there are\r\nwholesome masses waiting to be liberated from the shackles of\r\ncorruption, cronyism, double-talk and manipulation. Given half a decent\r\nchance, these good people will revert to mature capitalism, replete\r\nwith functioning institutions. It was up to the West to provide these\r\nlong deprived people with this eagerly awaited chance.\r\n\r\nWhat the West failed to realize was that communism was a collaborative\r\neffort - a symbiotic co-existence of the rulers and the ruled, a mutual\r\nundertaking and an all-pervasive pathology. It was not confined to\r\ncertain socio-economic strata, nor was it the imposed-from-above\r\nproduct of a rapacious nomenclature. It was a wink and nod social\r\ncontract, a co-ordinated robbery, and an orgy of degeneration,\r\ndecadence and corruption attended by all the citizenry to varying\r\ndegrees. It was a decades long incestuous relationship between all the\r\nsocial and economic players. To believe that all this can be erased\r\nvirtually overnight was worse than naive - it was idiotic.\r\n\r\nPerhaps what fooled the West was the appearance of law and order. Most\r\ncommunist countries inherited an infrastructure of laws and\r\ninstitutions from their historical predecessors. Consider the Czech\r\nRepublic, East Germany, Poland, Yugoslavia and even Russia. These\r\ncountries had courts and police and media and banks long prior to the\r\ncalamitous onset of communism. What the latter did - ingeniously - was\r\nto preserve the ossified skeletons of these institutions while draining\r\nthem from any real power. Decisions were made elsewhere, clandestinely,\r\nthe outcome of brutal internecine power struggles. But they were\r\nlegitimised by rubber stamp institutions: \"parliaments\", \"judicial\r\nsystem\", \"police\", \"banks\", and the \"media\". The West knew that these\r\ninstitutions were dysfunctional - but not to which breathtaking extent.\r\nIt assumed that nothing more than technical assistance was needed in\r\norder to breathe life into the institutional infrastructure. It assumed\r\nthat market forces, egged on by a class of new and increasingly wealthy\r\nshareholders, will force these institutions to shape up and begin to\r\ncater to the needs of their constituencies. Above all, it assumed that\r\nthe will to have better and functioning institutions was there - and\r\nthat the only thing missing was the knowledge.\r\n\r\nThese were all catastrophically wrong assumptions. In all\r\npost-communist countries, with no exception, one criminal association\r\n(the communist or socialist party) was simply replaced by another\r\n(often comprised of the very same people). Elections were used (more\r\noften, abused) simply to queue the looters, organized in political\r\nparties. The mass devastation of the state by everyone - the masses\r\nincluded - proceeded apace, financed by generous credits and grants\r\nfrom unsuspecting (or ostrich-like) multilaterals and donor conferences\r\n(recall Bosnia). If anything, materialism - the venal form of\r\n\"capitalism\" that erupted in the post communist planet - only\r\nexacerbated the moral and ethical degeneracy of everyone involved.\r\nWestern governments, Western banks, Western businessmen and Western\r\ninstitutions were sucked into the maelstrom of money laundering,\r\nillicit trading, corruption, shoddiness and violence. To perpetuate\r\ntheir clout and prowess, the new rulers did everything they could to\r\nhinder the reform of their institutions and their restoration to\r\nfunctionality.\r\n\r\nIn communist societies, banks were channels of political patronage\r\nthrough which money was transferred from the state to certain\r\nwell-connected, enterprises. Bankers were low-level clerks, who handled\r\na limited repertoire of forms in a prescribed set of ways. Communist\r\nsocieties had no commercial credits, consumer credits, payment\r\ninstruments, capital markets, retail banking, investment banking, or\r\nmerchant banking. The situation today, a decade after the demise of\r\ncommunism is not much improved. In most countries in transition, the\r\ndomestic powers that be conspired to fend off foreign ownership of\r\ntheir antiquated and comically (or, rather, tragically) politicised\r\n\"banks\". The totally inept and incompetent management was not replaced,\r\nnor were new management techniques introduced. The state kept bailing\r\nout and re-capitalizing ailing banks. Political cronies and family\r\nrelatives kept obtaining subsidized loans unavailable to the\r\nshrivelling private sector.\r\n\r\nThe courts, in the lands of socialism, were the vicious long arms of\r\nthe executive (actually, of the party). A mockery of justice, law and\r\ncommon sense - judges were ill trained, politically nominated,\r\nsubservient and cowed into toeing the official line. Of dubious\r\nintellectual pedigree and of certain unethical and immoral lineage -\r\njudges were widely despised and derided, known to be universally\r\ncorrupt and ignorant even of the laws that they were ostensibly\r\nappointed to administer. This situation hasn't changed in any post\r\ncommunist society. The courts are slow and inefficient, corrupt and\r\nlacking in specialization and education. The legal system is heavily\r\ntilted in favour of the state and against the individual. Judges are\r\nidentified politically and their decisions are often skewed. The\r\nexecutive, in many countries, does not hesitate to undermine the\r\nlegitimacy of the courts either by being seen to exploit their\r\npolitical predilections, or by attacking them for being amenable to\r\nsuch use by a rival party. This sorry state is only aggravated by the\r\nfrequent and erratic changes in legislation.\r\n\r\nIn communist times, the law enforcement agencies - primarily the\r\npolice, the customs and the secret service - were instruments of naked\r\naggression against dissidents, non-conformists and those who fell out\r\nof favour. In the centre of immeasurable corruption, policemen were\r\noften more dreaded than criminals. Customs officers enriched themselves\r\nby resorting to extortion, bribe taking and acts of straightforward\r\nexpropriation. The secret services often ran a state within a state,\r\nreplete with militias, prisons, a court system, a parallel financial\r\nsystem and trading companies. Again, the situation hasn't changed much.\r\nPerhaps with the exception of the secret services, all these phenomena\r\nstill exist and in the open.\r\n\r\nAnd then there is the media - the wastebasket of post communist\r\nsocieties, the cesspool of influence peddling and calumny. Journalists\r\nare easily bought and sold and their price is ever decreasing. They\r\nwork in mouthpieces of business interests masquerading as newspapers or\r\nelectronic media. They receive their instructions - to lie, to falsify,\r\nto ignore, to emphasize, to suppress, to extort, to inform, to\r\ncollaborate with the authorities - from their Editor in Chief. They\r\ntrade news for advertising. Some of them are involved in all manner of\r\ncriminal activities, others are simply unethical in the extreme. They\r\nall have pacts with Mammon. People do not believe a word these\r\ncontortionists of language and torturers of meaning write or say. It is\r\nby comparing these tampered and biased sources that people reach their\r\nown conclusions within their private medium.\r\n\r\nOne should hope that the disillusionment of the West is near. Post\r\ncommunist societies are sick and their institutions are a travesty. As\r\nis often the case with the mentally ill, there is a strong resistance\r\nto treatment and recovery. The options are two: to disengage - or to\r\ncommit to an asylum with force-feeding, forced administering of\r\nmedication and constant monitoring. The worst behaviour is to go on\r\npretending that the problem does not exist, or that it is much less\r\nserious than it really is. Denial and repression are the very sources\r\nof dysfunction. They have to be fought. And sometimes the patient's own\r\nwelfare - not to mention that of his environment - requires\r\narm-twisting or the infliction of pain. There is a kernel of good\r\npeople in every society. In the post communist societies, this kernel\r\nand suppressed and mocked and sometimes callously silenced. To give\r\nthese people a voice should be the first priority of the West. But this\r\ncannot be done by colluding with their oppressors. The West has to\r\nchoose - and now.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Article written on December 10, 1999 and published January 10, 2000\r\n\r\nin \"Central Europe Review\" volume 2, issue 1)\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInside, Outside\r\n\r\n\r\nDiasporas and Modern States\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA speech given at the meeting of the Canada-Macedonia Chamber of\r\nCommerce in Toronto, Canada on December 4th, 1999\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDistinguished Guests,\r\n\r\nI was born to parents of the working class in Israel, in 1961. It was a\r\ngrim neighbourhood, in a polluted industrial area, a red bastion of the\r\n\"socialist\" labour party. The latter would have easily qualified as\r\nBolshevik-communist anywhere else. It exerted the subtly pernicious\r\ndecadently corrupt kind of all-pervasive influence that is so typical\r\nin one party states. Sure, there were a few token fringe opposition\r\nparties but Labour's dominance went uninterrupted for more than 90\r\nyears. And corruption was both rife and rampant - nepotism, cronyism,\r\noutright bribery. During the 70s, the recently appointed governor of\r\nthe central bank was imprisoned and a minister committed suicide. Many\r\nmore immolated themselves or ended serving long sentences in\r\nover-crowded jails. Massive scandals erupted daily. Some of them cost\r\nthe country more than 10% of its GDP each (for example, the crisis of\r\nthe bank shares in 1983). In the 80s, privatisation turned into an orgy\r\nof privateering, spawning a class of robber barons. Red tape is still a\r\nmajor problem - and a major source of employment. And then there were\r\nthe wars and armed conflicts and vendettas and retributions and mines\r\nand missiles and exploding buses and the gas masks. In its 52 years of\r\nindependence the country has gone through 6 major official wars and\r\nmore than 10 war-sized conflicts.\r\n\r\nYet, despite all the above, Israel emerged as by far the most\r\noutstanding economic miracle. Its population was multiplied by 10 by\r\nsurges of immigrants. During the 50s, it tripled from 650,000 (1948 -\r\nJewish population figures only) to 2,000,000. The newcomers were all\r\ndestitute, the refugees of the geopolitics of hate from both the\r\nEastern block and from the Arab countries. The cultural, social and\r\nreligious profile of the latter stood in stark contrast to that of\r\ntheir \"hosts\". Thus the seeds of long term inter-ethnic,\r\ninter-cultural, social and religious conflicts were sown, soon to\r\nblossom into full-fledged rifts. During the 90s - 800,000 Russian\r\nimmigrants flooded a Jewish population of 4,500,000 souls. But these\r\ndemographic upheavals did not disturb a pattern of unprecedented\r\neconomic growth, which led to a GDP per capita per annum of 17,000 USD.\r\nIsrael is a world leader in agriculture, armaments, information\r\ntechnology, research and development in various scientific fields. Yet,\r\nit is a desert country, smaller in area than Macedonia and with much\r\nfewer and lesser natural endowments. It was subjected to an Arab\r\nembargo for more than 40 consecutive years. On average it had c. 3\r\nmillion inhabitants throughout its existence.\r\n\r\nIsrael's secret was the Jews in the Jewish Diaspora the world over.\r\n\r\nFrom its very inception - as a budding concept in the febrile brain of\r\nHerzl - the Jewish State was considered to be the home of all Jews,\r\nwherever they are. A Law of Return granted them the right to\r\nimmediately become Israeli citizens upon stepping on the country's\r\nsoil. The Jewish State was considered to be an instrument of the Jewish\r\nPeople, a shelter, an extension, a long arm, a collaborative and\r\nsymbiotic effort, an identity, an emotional apparatus, a buffer, an\r\ninsurance policy, a retirement home, a showcase, a convincing argument\r\nagainst all anti-Semites past and present. There was no question\r\nwhatsoever regarding the implicit and explicit contractual obligations\r\nbetween these two parties. The Jews in the Diaspora had to disregard\r\nand ignore Israel's warts, misdeeds and disadvantages. They had to turn\r\na public blind eye to corruption, nepotism, cronyism, the inefficient\r\nallocation of economic resources, blunders and failures. They had to\r\nsupport Israel financially. In return, the Jewish State had to ensure\r\nits own successful survival against all odds and to welcome all the\r\nJews to become its citizens whenever they chose to and no matter what\r\ntheir previous record or history is. Hence the constant arguments about\r\nWHO is a Jew and which institution should be allowed to monopolize the\r\nendowment of this lucrative and, potentially, life saving status. Hence\r\nthe bitter resentment felt in many circles toward the 200,000 or so\r\nnon-Jewish immigrants, the relatives of the Jewish ones who flooded\r\nIsrael's shores in the last decade.\r\n\r\nBut the consensus was and is unharmed, appearances notwithstanding. And\r\nthe Jews supported Israel in numerous straightforward and inventive\r\nways. They volunteered to fight for it. They spied for it. They donated\r\nmoney and built hospitals, schools, libraries, universities and\r\nmunicipal offices. They supported students through scholarships and\r\nyoung leaders through exchange programs. They managed and financed a\r\ngigantic network of educational facilities from youth summer camps to\r\ncultural exchanges. They bought the risky long-term bonds of the\r\nnascent state, which was constantly fighting for its life (and they did\r\nan excellent business in hindsight). Some of them invested money in\r\ncentrally planned, periphery bound, lost economic causes - ghost\r\nfactories that produced shoddy and undemanded goods. Year in and year\r\nout they poured an average of half a billion US dollars a year annually\r\n(about 200 million US dollars a year in net funds). Most of the money\r\ndid not come from the stereotypical Jewish billionaires. Most of it\r\ncame through a concerted effort of voluntary (though surely peer\r\npressured) money raising among hundreds of thousands of poor Jews the\r\nworld over. The Jewish people set up a horde of organizations whose aim\r\nwas collection of funds and their application to the advancement of\r\nZionist and Jewish causes. Every Jew deposited a few weekly cents into\r\nthe \"Blue Box\" - \"for the cause\": to redeem land, to establish\r\nsettlements, to open educational institutions, to publish a Jewish\r\nnewspaper, to act against anti-Semitism, to rebrand Judaism and fight\r\nnefarious stereotypes. It was a grassroots movement directed only by\r\nthe dual slogans of \"No Other Choice\" and \"The Whole World is Against\r\nUs\". Emanating from posttraumatic and paranoiac roots - it later became\r\na groundswell of goodwill, enthusiastic co-operation and pride.\r\n\r\nAnd all this time, the Jews knew. Not only the sophisticated, worldly\r\nJewish moneymen. Not only the cosmopolitan, erudite Jewish\r\nintellectuals. But also the more typical small time tailors and\r\nshoemakers and restaurateurs and cab drivers and plumbers and sweatshop\r\ntextile workers. They all knew - and it did not sway them one bit. It\r\ndid not drive them away. They did not gripe and complain or abstain.\r\nThey kept coming. They kept pouring money into this seemingly\r\ninsatiable black hole. They kept believing. They kept waiting and they\r\nkept active. And all these long decades - they knew.\r\n\r\nThey knew that Israel was ruled by a caste of utterly corrupt\r\npoliticians whose avarice equalled only their incompetence. They knew\r\nthat central planning was going nowhere fast. They knew that elections\r\nwere rigged, that red tape was strangling entrepreneurship and\r\ninitiative, that inter ethnic tension was explosive. They knew that\r\nIsrael lost its not to a demographically exploding Arab population\r\ncoupled with endless acts of terrorism. They knew that Israel's conduct\r\nwas not fair, not always democratic, and often unnecessarily\r\naggressive. They knew that tenders were won by bribes, that\r\ntransparency was a mockery, that the courts were negligent and\r\ninefficient. They knew that property rights were not protected and that\r\npeople were pusillanimous and greedy and petty and self-occupied (not\r\nto say narcissistic). They witnessed the waste of scarce resources, the\r\nindefinitely protracted processes, the bureaucratic delays, the free\r\nuse of public funds for private ends. They watched as ministers and\r\nmembers of the Knesset and top law enforcement agent conspired to\r\nengage in crime and then colluded in covering it up. And they felt\r\nbetrayed and agonized over all this.\r\n\r\nYet, they NEVER - NEVER - not even for a second, considered giving up.\r\nThey NEVER - NEVER - stopped the money coming. They did not discontinue\r\nthe dialogue intended to make things better, over there, the land of\r\ntheir so distant fathers. They always donated and invested and financed\r\nand visited and cajoled and argued and opined and hoped and dreamed.\r\n\r\nBecause this was THEIR country, as well. Because it was a partnership\r\nand the inexperienced, stray partner was given the benefit of\r\nindefinite doubt. Because they saw the opportunity - the economic\r\nopportunity, for sure - but, above all, the historical opportunity.\r\nWhen Israel did mature, when it became a law state, orderly,\r\ntransparent, efficient, forward looking, the high tech Israel we all\r\nknow - it repaid them over and over again. They all made money on their\r\ndecades of patience and endurance. The rich made big money. The small\r\nguys made less. But there is no Jew today who can say that he lost\r\nmoney in Israel because he became financially or economically active\r\nthere in the long run.\r\n\r\nThey stuck to Israel primarily because they were Jews (and, by easy\r\nextension, Israelis). And this is what being a Jew meant. And they were\r\nrichly rewarded by the Justice Minister of history. Perhaps there is a\r\nlesson to be learnt here by Macedonians in the Diaspora. I, for one, am\r\nsure there is.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Magla Vocables\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Macedonians have a word for it - \"Magla\", fog. It signifies the\r\ntwin arts of duplicity and ambiguity. In the mental asylum that the\r\nswathe of socialist countries was, even language was pathologised. It\r\nmutated into a weapon of self-defence, a verbal fortification, a medium\r\nwithout a message, replacing words with vocables. Easterners (in this\r\ntext, the unfortunate residents of the Kafkaesque landscape which\r\nstretches between Russia and Albania) don't talk or communicate. They\r\nfend off. They hide and evade and avoid and disguise. In the planet of\r\ncapricious and arbitrary unpredictability, of shifting semiotic and\r\nsemantic dunes that they inhabited for so many decades (or centuries) -\r\nthey perfected the ability to say nothing in lengthy, Castro-like\r\nspeeches. The ensuing convoluted sentences are Arabesques of\r\nmeaninglessness, acrobatics of evasion, lack of commitment elevated to\r\nan ideology. The Easterner prefers to wait and see and see what waiting\r\nbrings. It is the postponement of the inevitable that leads to the\r\ninevitability of postponement as a strategy of survival.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to really understand an Easterner. The syntax fast\r\ndeteriorates into ever more labyrinthine structures. The grammar\r\ntortured to produce the verbal Doppler shifts essential to disguise the\r\nsource of the information, its distance from reality, the speed of its\r\ndegeneration into rigid official versions. Buried under the lush flora\r\nand fauna of idioms without an end, the language erupts, like some\r\nexotic rash, an autoimmune reaction to its infection and contamination.\r\nAnd this newspeak, this malignant form of political correctness is not\r\nthe exclusive domain of politicians or \"intellectuals\". Like vile weeds\r\nit spread throughout, strangling with absent minded persistence the\r\nability to understand, to agree, to disagree and to debate, to present\r\narguments, to compare notes, to learn and to teach. Easterners,\r\ntherefore, never talk to each other - rather, they talk at each other.\r\nThey exchange subtexts, camouflage-wrapped by elaborate, florid, texts.\r\nThey read between the lines, spawning a multitude of private languages,\r\nprejudices, superstitions, conspiracy theories, rumours, phobias and\r\nmass hysterias. Theirs is a solipsistic world - where communication is\r\npermitted only with oneself and the aim of language is to throw others\r\noff the scent.\r\n\r\nThis has profound implications. Communication through unequivocal,\r\nunambiguous, information-rich symbol systems is such an integral and\r\ncrucial part of our world - that its absence is not postulated even in\r\nthe remotest galaxies, which grace the skies of science fiction. In\r\nthis sense, Easterners are nothing short of aliens. It is not that they\r\nemploy a different language, a code to be deciphered by a new\r\nChampollion. The Cyrillic alphabet is not the obstacle. It is also not\r\nthe outcome of cultural differences. It is the fact that language is\r\nput by Easterners to a different use - not to communicate but to\r\nobscure, not to share but to abstain, not to learn but to defend and\r\nresist, not to teach but to preserve ever less tenable monopolies, to\r\ndisagree without incurring wrath, to criticize without commitment, to\r\nagree without appearing to do so. Thus, Eastern contracts are vague\r\nexpressions of intentions at a given moment - rather than the clear\r\nlisting of long term, iron-cast and mutual commitments. Eastern laws\r\nare loopholed incomprehensibles, open to an exegesis so wide and so\r\nself-contradictory that it renders them meaningless. Eastern\r\npoliticians and Eastern intellectuals often hang themselves by their\r\nown verbose Gordic knots, having stumbled through a minefield of\r\nlogical fallacies and endured self inflicted inconsistencies.\r\nUnfinished sentences hover in the air, like vapour above a semantic\r\nswamp.\r\n\r\nIn some countries (the poorer ones, which were suppressed for centuries\r\nby foreign occupiers), there is the strong urge not to offend. Still at\r\nthe tribal-village stage of social development, intimacy and\r\ninter-dependence are great. Peer pressure is irresistible and it\r\nresults in conformity and mental homogeneity. Aggressive tendencies,\r\nstrongly repressed in this social pressure cooker, are close under the\r\nveneer of forced civility and violent politeness. Constructive\r\nambiguity, a non-committal \"everyone is good and right\", an atavistic\r\nvariant of moral relativism and tolerance bred of fear and of contempt\r\n- are all at the service of this eternal vigilance against aggressive\r\ndrives, at the disposal of a never ending peacekeeping mission.\r\n\r\nIn other countries, language is used cruelly and ruthlessly to ensnare\r\none's enemies, to saw confusion and panic, to move the masses, to leave\r\nthe listeners in doubt, in hesitation, in paralysis, to gain control,\r\nor to punish. There, symbols are death sentences in both the literal\r\nand the figurative senses. Poets, authors and journalists still vanish\r\nregularly and newspapers and books are compiled into black lists with\r\ndreadful consequences. In these countries, language is enslaved and\r\nforced to lie. There is no news - only views, no interest - only\r\ninterests, no facts - only propaganda, no communication - only\r\nex-communication. The language is appropriated and expropriated. It is\r\nconsidered to be a weapon, an asset, a piece of lethal property, a\r\ntraitorous mistress to be gang raped into submission.\r\n\r\nAnd yet in other places in the East, the language is a lover. The\r\ninfatuation with its very sound leads to a pyrotechnic type of speech\r\nwhich sacrifices its meaning to its music. Its speakers pay more\r\nattention to the composition than to the content. They are swept by it,\r\nintoxicated by its perfection, inebriated by the spiralling complexity\r\nof its forms. Here, language is an inflammatory process. It attacks the\r\nsocial tissues with artistic fierceness. It invades the healthy cells\r\nof reason and logic, of cool-headed argumentation and level headed\r\ndebate. It raises the temperature of the body politic. It often kills.\r\nIt moves masses. Submerged in and lured by the notes issued forth by\r\nthe pied piper of the moment - nations go to war, or to civil war,\r\nresonating with the echoes of their language.\r\n\r\nLanguage is a leading indicator of the psychological and institutional\r\nhealth of social units. Social capital can often be measured in\r\ncognitive (hence, verbal-lingual) terms. To monitor the level of\r\ncomprehensibility and lucidity of texts is to study the degree of\r\nsanity of nations (think about the rambling \"Mein Kampf\"). There can\r\nexist no hale society without unambiguous speech, without clear\r\ncommunications, without the traffic of idioms and content that is an\r\ninseparable part of every social contract. Our language determines how\r\nwe perceive our world. It IS our mind and our consciousness. The\r\nmuch-touted transition starts in the mind and consciousness determines\r\nreality. Marx would have approved.\r\n\r\n\r\n (Article written on December 8, 1999 and published December 13, 1999\r\n\r\nin \"Central Europe Review\" volume 1, issue 25)\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Elders of Zion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI was shown the same book in Yugoslavia, in Macedonia and in Bulgaria -\r\n\"The World Conspiracy\" - a shabby tome written by an ageing \"scholar\".\r\nThe main, unabashedly anti-Semitic, hypothesis (presented as undisputed\r\nfact) is that the Jews rule the world supreme - always have, probably\r\nalways will. Lists of prominent Jews in the world of international\r\nfinance reprinted with lists of influential Jews in the Soviet\r\ncommunist regime. And it all amounts to a well-organized secretive\r\nmachinery of illicit power, claims the author with all the persuasion\r\nof a paranoid. In here, trash magazines dwell endlessly on these and\r\nsimilar themes.\r\n\r\nYet, anti-Semitism is only one species in a zoo of rumours, conspiracy\r\ntheories, Meta histories and metaphysics. Superstitions, prejudices and\r\ncalumny thrive in the putrid soil of disinformation, mis-information\r\nand lack of information. In the void created by unreliable, politicised\r\nand corrupt media - rumour mills spring eternal. It is a malignant\r\ngrowth, the outcome of a breakdown of trust so compleat - that\r\ncommunication is rendered impossible. This is the main characteristic\r\nof the East (from Russia to Albania): distrust. Citizens and\r\npoliticians, businessmen and government, the media and its consumers,\r\nmanufacturers and service providers, the sick and their doctors - all\r\nsuspect each other of ulterior motives and foul play. All are more\r\noften than not quite right to do so.\r\n\r\nIt is a Kafkaesque, sealed universe in which nothing is, as it appears\r\nto be. This acrimonious divorce between appearances and essence, facade\r\nand truth, the Potemkin and the real - is a facet of daily life, of the\r\nmost mundane exchanges, of the most trivial pursuits. Motives are\r\nsought with increasing urgency - why did he do it, what did he try to\r\nachieve, why had he not chosen a different path, why here, why with us,\r\nwhy now, what can it teach us. Information is pursued frantically,\r\nappearances discarded, data juggled, heated debates ensue, versions\r\nerupt, only to subside and be replaced by others. It is a feverish\r\nritual, the sound of clashing exegeses, of theories constructed and\r\ndemolished in vacuo.\r\n\r\nAt the heart of it all, is the unbearable uncertainty of being.\r\nPolitical uncertainty under communism was replaced by economic\r\nuncertainty under the insidious and venal form of capitalism that\r\nreplaced it. Tucked in identical cubicles, the citizens of planet\r\ncommunism were at least assured of a make belief job in a sprawling\r\nbureaucracy or in a decrepit factory, manufacturing redundant documents\r\nor shoddy goods. Subsistence was implicitly guaranteed by the\r\nkleptocracy that ruled them and, in principle, it was always possible\r\nto ignore the moral stench and join the nomenklatura, thereby\r\ndeveloping instant upward mobility. Corruption, theft and graft were\r\ntolerated by the state as means of complementing income. Life was drab\r\nbut safe as long as one abstained from politics and subserviently\r\nconsumed the bitter medicines of acquiescence and collaboration. The\r\nvast majority (with the exception of the USSR under Stalin) were not\r\naffected by the arbitrary capriciousness of history. They decayed\r\nslowly in their housing estates, morally degenerate, possession-less\r\nbut certain of a future that is the spitting image of their past.\r\n\r\nUnder the spastic orgy of legalized robbery of state assets that passed\r\nfor privatisation, millions were made redundant while thousands\r\nenriched themselves by choreographed looting. The results were\r\ninstability, unpredictability, uncertainty and fear. In a world thus\r\nunhinged, the masses groped for reason, for a scheme, for a method in\r\nthe madness, for an explanation, however sinister and ominous. Anything\r\nwas preferable to the seemingly random natural forces unleashed upon\r\nthem with such apparent vengeance. Even a \"World Government\" (a\r\nfavourite), the Illuminati (a Freemasonry-like movement but much more\r\nodious), the Jews, the USA, aliens. The greatest conspiracy theory of\r\nthem all - the Phoenix of religion - sprang back to life from the ashes\r\nit was reduced to by communism. A host of mystical beliefs and sects\r\nand cults mushroomed noxiously in the humid shadows of irrationality.\r\n\r\nThus, every event, no matter how insignificant, any occurrence, no\r\nmatter how inconsequential and any coincidence, no matter how\r\ncoincidental - assume heraldic meaning. People in these domains carry\r\ntheir complex jigsaw puzzles with them. They welcome each new piece\r\nwith the zeal of the converted. They bellow triumphantly with every\r\n\"proof\" of their pet theory, with every datum, with each rumour. Things\r\ndon't just happen - they whisper, conspiratorially - things are\r\ndirected from above, ordained, regulated, prevented, or encouraged by\r\n\"them\". A group of 400 rule the world. They are Jews, they are the Serb\r\nmafia, or the Bulgarian. Or the Americans who plan to dominate (which\r\nobviously puts Kosovo in context). They are the rich and powerful, the\r\nobjects of envy and frightened admiration, of virulent hate and rage.\r\nThey are responsible. We pay the price - we, the small and powerless\r\nand poor. And it is hopeless, it has been like that forever. The\r\ndisparity between them and us is too great. Resistance is futile.\r\n\r\nWhy was this president elected? Surely, the West demanded it. Or\r\npolitical parties conspired to rig the vote. Or rich businessmen\r\nsupported him. What is the real aim of foreign investors in coming to\r\nthese godforsaken places, if not to infiltrate and penetrate and\r\nestablish their long-term dominion? And wouldn't it be safe to assume\r\nthat al the foreigners are spies, that all the Jews collaborate, that\r\nthe neighbours would have liked to conquer and to subjugate us, that\r\nthe world is a colossal puppet show? In other words, is it not true\r\nthat we are puppets - victims - in a theatre not of our making? They\r\nfilter out that which does not conform to their persuasion, does not\r\naccord with their suspicions, and does not fit within their schemes.\r\n\r\nThis deferral of responsibility brings relief from shame and blame.\r\nGuilt is allayed by symbolically and ritually passing it onto another.\r\nFear is quelled by the introduction of schemata. These are potent\r\npsychological incentives. They provide structure to the amorphous,\r\nbring order to the chaos that is the brave, new world of the economies\r\nin transition. Flux is replaced by immutable \"truths\", possibilities by\r\ncertainties, threats by \"knowledge\". It is a re-construction and\r\nreconquest of a paradise lost by giving up the fruit of the tree of\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nIt is this hyper-vigilance, this elevated suspicion, these instant\r\ncertainties fabricated from frail pseudo-theories and conspiracies -\r\nthat make the Man of the East so easy to manipulate, so vulnerable, so\r\namenable to collude in his own downfall. Bewitched by his self-spun\r\nmyths, captivated by his own paranoia, under the spell of his magical,\r\nimmature, thinking - non critical, non analytical, non discriminating -\r\nhe is exquisitely susceptible to crooks and charlatans, to manipulators\r\nand demagogues, to the realization of the very threats he tried to fend\r\noff in the first place.\r\n\r\nHere is what the DSM (\"Diagnostics and Statistics Manual\") IV (1994)\r\npublished by the APA (American Psychiatric Association) has to say\r\nabout paranoids and schizotypals:\r\n\r\nThe Paranoid Personality Disorder\r\n\r\nA pervasive distrust and suspiciousness of others such that their\r\nmotives are interpreted as malevolent, beginning by early adulthood and\r\npresent in a variety of contexts, as indicated by four (or more) of the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n1. Suspects without sufficient basis, that others are exploiting,\r\nharming, or deceiving him or her;\r\n\r\n2. Is preoccupied with unjustified doubts about the loyalty or\r\ntrustworthiness of friends or associates;\r\n\r\n3. Is reluctant to confide in others because of unwarranted fear\r\nthat the information will be used maliciously against him or her;\r\n\r\n4. Reads hidden demeaning or threatening meanings into benign\r\nremarks or events;\r\n\r\n5. Persistently bears grudges, i.e., is unforgiving of insults,\r\ninjuries, or slights;\r\n\r\n6. Perceives attacks on his or her character or reputation that\r\nare not apparent to others and is quick to react angrily or to\r\ncounterattack;\r\n\r\n7. Has recurrent suspicions, without justification, regarding\r\nfidelity of spouse or sexual partner.\r\n\r\nSchizotypal Personality Disorder\r\n\r\nA pervasive pattern of social and interpersonal deficits marked by\r\nacute discomfort with and reduced capacity for close relationships as\r\nwell as by cognitive or perceptual distortions and eccentricities of\r\nbehaviour beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of\r\ncontexts as indicated by five (or more) of the following:\r\n\r\n1. Ideas of reference (excluding delusions of reference) - (SV:\r\nthe delusional belief that others are looking at him pointing at him,\r\ntalking about him, especially in a derogatory manner);\r\n\r\n2. Odd beliefs or magical thinking that influences behaviour and\r\nis inconsistent with subcultural norms (e.g., superstitiousness, belief\r\nin clairvoyance, telepathy, or \"sixth sense\"; in children and\r\nadolescents, bizarre fantasies or preoccupations);\r\n\r\n3. Unusual perceptual experiences, including bodily illusions;\r\n\r\n4. Odd thinking and speech (e.g., vague, circumstantial,\r\nmetaphorical, over-elaborate, or stereotyped);\r\n\r\n5. Suspiciousness or paranoid ideation;\r\n\r\n6. Inappropriate and constricted affect;\r\n\r\n7. Behaviour, or appearance that is odd, eccentric, or peculiar;\r\n\r\n8. Lack of close friends or confidants other than first-degree\r\nrelatives;\r\n\r\n9. Excessive social anxiety that does not diminish with\r\nfamiliarity and tends to be associated with paranoid fears rather than\r\nnegative judgements about self.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Article written on December 9, 1999 and published December 13, 1999\r\n\r\nin \"Central Europe Review\" volume 1, issue 25)\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Last Family\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"One man cannot be a warrior on a battlefield\"\r\n\r\n(Russian proverb)\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no word for it in Russian. Platon Karatayev, the typical\r\n\"Russian soul\" in Tolstoy's \"War and Peace\", extols, for pages at a\r\ntime, the virtues of communality and disparages the individual - this\r\notherwise useless part of the greater whole. In Macedonia the words\r\n\"private\" or \"privacy\" pertain to matters economic. The word \"intimacy\"\r\nis used instead to designate the state of being free of prying,\r\nintrusive eyes and acts of meddling. Throughout Central and Eastern\r\nEurope, the rise of \"individualism\" did not give birth to its\r\ncorollary: \"privacy\". After decades (and, in most cases, centuries) of\r\ncramped, multi-generational shared accommodation, it is no wonder.\r\n\r\nTo the alienated and schizoid ears of Westerners, the survival of\r\nfamily and community in CEE sounds like an attractive proposition. A\r\ndual-purpose safety net, both emotional and economic, the family in\r\ncountries in transition provides its members with unemployment\r\nbenefits, accommodation, food and psychological advice to boot.\r\nDivorced daughters, saddled with little (and not so little) ones, the\r\nprodigal sons incapable of finding a job befitting their\r\nqualifications, the sick, the unhappy - all are absorbed by the\r\ncompassionate bosom of the family and, by extension the community. The\r\nfamily, the neighbourhood, the community, the village, the tribe - are\r\nunits of subversion as well as useful safety valves, releasing and\r\nregulating the pressures of contemporary life in the modern,\r\nmaterialistic, crime ridden state. The ancient blood feud laws of the\r\nkanoon were handed over through familial lineages in northern Albania,\r\nin defiance of the paranoiac Enver Hoxha regime. Criminals hide among\r\ntheir kin in the Balkans, thus effectively evading the long arm of the\r\nlaw (state). Jobs are granted, contracts signed and tenders won on an\r\nopen and strict nepotistic basis and no one finds it odd or wrong.\r\nThere is something atavistically heart-warming in all this.\r\n\r\nHistorically, the rural units of socialization and social organization\r\nwere the family and the village. As villagers migrated to the cities,\r\nthese structural and functional patterns were imported by them, en\r\nmasse. The shortage of urban apartments and the communist invention of\r\nthe communal apartment (its tiny rooms allocated one per family with\r\nkitchen and bathroom common to all) only served to perpetuate these\r\nancient modes of multi-generational huddling. At best, the few\r\navailable apartments were shared by three generations: parents, married\r\noffspring and their children. In many cases, the living space was also\r\nshared by sickly or no-good relatives and even by unrelated families.\r\n\r\nThese living arrangements - more adapted to rustic open spaces than to\r\nhigh rises - led to severe social and psychological dysfunctions. To\r\nthis very day, Balkan males are spoiled by the subservience and\r\nservitude of their in-house parents and incessantly and compulsively\r\ncatered to by their submissive wives. Occupying someone else's home,\r\nthey are not well acquainted with adult responsibilities. Stunted\r\ngrowth and stagnant immaturity are the hallmarks of an entire\r\ngeneration, stifled by the ominous proximity of suffocating, invasive\r\nlove. Unable to lead a healthy sex life behind paper thin walls, unable\r\nto raise their children and as many children as they see fit, unable to\r\ndevelop emotionally under the anxiously watchful eye of their parents -\r\nthis greenhouse generation is doomed to a zombie-like existence in the\r\ntwilight nether land of their parents' caves. Many ever more eagerly\r\nawait the demise of their caring captors and the promised land of their\r\ninherited apartments, free of their parents' presence.\r\n\r\nThe daily pressures and exigencies of co-existence are enormous. The\r\nprying, the gossip, the criticism, the chastising, the small agitating\r\nmannerisms, the smells, the incompatible personal habits and\r\npreferences, the pusillanimous bookkeeping - all serve to erode the\r\nindividual and to reduce him or her to the most primitive mode of\r\nsurvival. This is further exacerbated by the need to share expenses, to\r\nallocate labour and tasks, to plan ahead for contingencies, to see off\r\nthreats, to hide information, to pretend and to fend off emotionally\r\ninjurious behaviour. It is a sweltering tropic of affective cancer.\r\n\r\nNewly found materialism brought these territories a malignant form of\r\ncapitalism coupled with a sub-culture of drugs and crime. The\r\neventuating disintegration of all polities in the ensuing moral vacuum\r\nwas complete. From the more complex federations or states and their\r\ngovernments, through intermediate municipalities and down to the most\r\nprimitive of political cells - the family - they all crumbled in a\r\nstorm of discontent and blood. The mutant frontier-\"independence\" or\r\npioneer-\"individualism\" imported from Western B movies led to a\r\nfunctional upheaval unmatched by a structural one. People want privacy\r\nand intimacy more than ever - but they still inhabit the same shoddily\r\nconstructed, congested accommodation and they still earn poorly or are\r\nunemployed. This tension between aspiration and perspiration is\r\npotentially revolutionary. It is this unaccomplished, uneasy\r\nmetamorphosis that tore the social fabric of CEE apart, rendering it\r\npoisoned and dysfunctional. This is nothing new - it is what brought\r\nsocialism and its more vicious variants down.\r\n\r\nBut what is new is inequality. Ever the pathologically envious, the\r\ncitizens of CEE bathed in common misery. The equal distribution of\r\npoverty and hardship guaranteed their peace of mind. A Jewish proverb\r\nsays: \"The trouble of the many is half a consolation.\" It is this\r\nbreakdown of symmetry of wretchedness that really shook the social\r\norder. The privacy and intimacy and freedom gained by the few are bound\r\nto incite the many into acts of desperation. After all, what can be\r\nmore individualistic, more private, more mind requiting, more\r\ntranquillizing than being part of a riotous mob intent of implementing\r\na platform of hate and devastation?\r\n\r\n\r\n(Article written on January 9, 2000 and published January 24, 2000\r\n\r\nin \"Central Europe Review\" volume 2, issue 3)\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRasputin in Transition\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mad glint in his eyes is likely to be nothing more ominous than\r\nmaladjusted contact lenses. If not clean-shaven, he is likely to sport\r\nnothing wilder than a goatee. More likely an atheist than a priest,\r\nthis mutation of the ageless confidence artist is nonetheless the\r\ndirect spiritual descendent of Rasputin, the raving maniac who governed\r\nRussia until his own execution by Russian noblemen and patriots.\r\n\r\nThey are to be found in all countries in transition. Wild and insidious\r\nweeds, the outcome of wayward pollination by mutated capitalism. They\r\nprey on their victims, at first acquiring their confidence and love,\r\nthen penetrating their political, social and financial structures\r\nalmost as a virus would: stealthily and treacherously. By the time\r\ntheir quarry wakes up to its infection and subjugation - it is already\r\ntoo late. By then, the invader will have become part of the invaded or\r\nits master, either through blackmail or via tempting subornation.\r\n\r\nThis region of the CEE and the Balkans provides for fertile grounds. It\r\nis a Petrie dish upon which cultures of corruption and scandalous\r\nconduct are fermented. The typical exploiter of these vulnerabilities\r\nis a foreigner. Things foreign are held in awe and adulation by a\r\npopulace so down trodden and made to feel inferior in every way, not\r\nleast by foreign tutors and advisors. The craving to be loved, this\r\ngnawing urge to be accepted, to be a member of the club, to be\r\ndistinguished from one's former neighbours - are irresistible. The\r\nmodern Rasputin doles out this unconditional acceptance, this\r\nall-encompassing affinity, the echoes of avuncularity. In doing so, he\r\nevokes in the recipients such warmth, such relief, such fervour and\r\nreciprocity - that he becomes an idol, a symbol of a paradise long\r\nlost, a golden braid. Having thus completed the first phase of his\r\nmeticulous attack - he moves on to the second chapter in this book of\r\nbody snatching.\r\n\r\nArmed with his new-fangled popularity, the crook moves on and leverages\r\nit to the hilt. He does so by feigning charity, by faking interest, by\r\nfalse \"constructive criticism\". To his slow forming army, he recruits\r\nthe media, the flower children, the bleeding hearts, reformers,\r\ndissidents and the occasional freak. By holding old authority in\r\ndisdain, by declaring his contempt for the methods of the \"tried and\r\ntrue\", by appearing to make war upon all rot and immorality - this\r\ncreature of expediency emerges as a folk hero. It is the more cynical\r\nand world weary and \"sophisticated\" members of society that lead the\r\nway, succumbing to his ardour and conviction, to his child-like\r\ninnocence, to his unwavering agenda. He cleverly thrusts at them the\r\ndouble edge of their own disillusionment and disappointment. Thus\r\nmirrored, they are transformed and converted into his camp of renewal\r\nand clean promises by this epiphany. They hand him the keys to every\r\nmedium, the very codes and secrets that make him so powerful. They\r\npledge their alliance and allegiance and render to him the access they\r\npossess to the nerve centres of society. The castle gates thus opened\r\nfrom inside, his victory assured, the rogue moves on to consummate this\r\nunholy marriage between himself and the deceived.\r\n\r\nAlways in fear of light, he surreptitiously and cunningly begins to\r\ninteract with the foci of power and money in the land. However\r\nloathsome he is to them, however repulsive the experience, however\r\nundesirable the effects of their surrender - they are made to recognize\r\nhim as their equal. With the might of the media and a large part of the\r\npeople behind him, he can no longer be ignored. Their conspiracy-prone\r\nmind, awash with superstitions and its attaching phobias, tries to\r\ncomprehend his meteoric rise, the forcefulness with which he treads,\r\nhis unmitigated, inane, self-confidence. Is he a spy? A member of a\r\nsecret order? The latent agent of a hyperpower? The heart of a world\r\nconspiracy? Has he no fear of retribution and no remorse? Before this\r\ngreat unknown, they kneel and yield, an atavistic reaction to atavistic\r\nfears. Now all doors are thrown open, all deals are made available, all\r\nsecrets are revealed. The more he learns, the mightier he becomes - the\r\nmore his might, the more he learns. To him, a virtuous cycle, to his\r\nhosts - a vicious one.\r\n\r\nIn all this tumult, he does not lose sight of his original goals -\r\npower, money, fame, all three. It is a relentless pursuit, an obsessive\r\nhunt, a ruthless and unscrupulous chase. In his war, no prisoners are\r\ntaken, no price too dear, no human in his orbit left untouched. He will\r\nmanipulate and threat and beg and promise and plead and blackmail and\r\nextort to accomplish that which he set out to achieve: decision making\r\npowers, wealth, clout, exposure and resultant fame. It is at this stage\r\nthat the latter day Rasputin emerges from the shadows and joins\r\nofficialdom or concludes lucrative transactions based on favourably\r\ndeflated prices and insider dealing. By now, his shady past is no\r\nlonger a hindrance. His prowess far exceeds his invidious biography.\r\nWell installed, he ignores both media and the people. He brushes aside\r\ncontemptuously all criticism and enquiry. His true, narcissistic, face\r\nis exposed and it is hideous to behold. But there is nothing to be done\r\nand all resistance is futile. The con man now is in a haste to maximize\r\nhis hard earned profits and exit the scene, on his way to another realm\r\nof guile and naiveté.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Article written on January 25, 2000 and published February 14, 2000\r\n\r\nin \"Central Europe Review\" volume 2, issue 6)\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Honorary Academic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMira Markovic is an \"Honorary Academic\" of the Russian Academy of\r\nScience. It cost a lot of money to obtain this title and the Serb\r\nmulti-billionaire Karic was only too glad to cough it up. Whatever else\r\nyou say about Balkan cronies, they rarely bite the hand that feeds them\r\n(unless and until it is expedient to do so). And whatever else you say\r\nabout Russia, it adapted remarkably to capitalism. Everything has a\r\nprice and a market. Israel had to learn this fact the hard way when\r\nRussian practical-nurse-level medical doctors and\r\nconstruction-worker-level civil engineers flooded its shores.\r\nEverything is for sale in this region of opportunities, instant\r\neducation inclusive.\r\n\r\nIt seems that academe suffered the most during the numerous shock\r\ntherapies and transition periods showered upon the impoverished\r\ninhabitants of Eastern and Central Europe. The resident of decrepit\r\ncommunist-era buildings, it had to cope with a flood of eager students\r\nand a deluge of anachronistic \"scholars\". But in Russia, the CIS and\r\nthe Balkans the scenery is nothing short of Dantesque. Unschooled in\r\nany major European language, lazily content with their tenured\r\npositions, stagnant and formal - the academics and academicians of the\r\nBalkans are both failures and a resounding indictment of the rigor\r\nmortis that was socialism. Economics textbooks stop short of mentioning\r\nFriedman or Phelps. History textbooks should better be relegated to the\r\nscience fiction shelves. A brave facade of self-sufficiency covers up a\r\nvast hinterland of inferiority complex fully supported by real\r\ninferiority. In antiquated libraries, shattered labs, crooked buildings\r\nand inadequate facilities, students pursue redundant careers with the\r\nwrong teachers.\r\n\r\nCorruption seethes under this repellent surface. Teachers sell exams,\r\ntake bribes, and trade incestuous sex with their students. They refuse\r\nto contribute to their communities. In all my years in the Balkans, I\r\nhave yet to come across a voluntary act - a single voluntary act - by\r\nan academic. And I have come across numerous refusals to help and to\r\ncontribute. Materialism incarnate.\r\n\r\nThis sorry state of affairs has a twofold outcome. On the one hand,\r\nherds of victims of rigidly dictated lectures and the suppression of\r\nfree thought. These academic products suffer from the twin afflictions\r\nof irrelevance of skills and the inability to acquire relevant ones,\r\nthe latter being the result of decades of brainwashing and industrial\r\neducational methods. Unable to match their anyhow outdated knowledge\r\nwith anything a modern marketplace can offer - they default on to\r\nmenial jobs, rebel or pull levers to advance in life. Which leads us to\r\nthe death of meritocracy and why this region's future is behind it.\r\n\r\nIn the wake of the downfall of all the major ideologies of the 20th\r\ncentury - Fascism, Communism, etc. the New Order, heralded by President\r\nBush, emerged as a battle of Open Club versus Closed Club societies, at\r\nleast from the economic point of view.\r\n\r\nAll modern states and societies must choose whether to be governed by\r\nmerit (meritocracy) or by the privileged few (oligarchy). It is\r\ninevitable that the social and economic structures be controlled by\r\nelites. It is a complex world and only a few can master the knowledge\r\nit takes to govern effectively. What sets meritocracy apart is not the\r\nnumber of members of its ruling (or leading) class, usually no larger\r\nthan an oligarchy. No, it is distinguished by its membership criteria\r\nand by the mode of their application.\r\n\r\nThe meritocratic elite is an open club because it satisfies three\r\nconditions:\r\n\r\n1. The process and rules of joining up (i.e., the criteria) are\r\ntransparent and widely known;\r\n\r\n2. The application and membership procedures are uniform, equal to\r\nall and open to continuous public scrutiny and criticism;\r\n\r\n3. The system alters its membership requirements in direct\r\nresponse to public feedback and to the changing social and economic\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\nTo belong to a meritocracy one needs to satisfy a series of demands,\r\nwhose attainment is entirely up to he individual. And that is all that\r\none needs to do. The rules of joining and of membership are cast in\r\niron. The wishes and opinions of those who happen to comprise the club\r\nat any given moment are of no importance and of no consequence.\r\nMeritocracy is a \"fair play\" by rules of equal chance to derive\r\nbenefits. Put differently, is the rule of law.\r\n\r\nTo join a meritocratic club, one needs to demonstrate that one is in\r\npossession of, or has access to, \"inherent\" parameters, such as\r\nintelligence, a certain level of education, a potential to contribute\r\nto society. An inherent parameter must correspond to a criterion and\r\nthe latter must be applied independent of the views and predilections\r\nof those who sometimes are forced to apply it. The members of a\r\ncommittee or a board can disdain an applicant, or they might wish not\r\nto approve a candidate. Or they may prefer someone else for the job\r\nbecause they owe her something, or because they play golf with him.\r\nYet, they are permitted to consider only the applicant's or the\r\ncandidate's \"inherent\" parameters: does he have the necessary tenure,\r\nqualifications, education, experience? Does he contribute to his\r\nworkplace, community, and society at large? In other words: is he\r\n\"worthy\" or \"deserving\"? Not WHO he is - but WHAT he is.\r\n\r\nGranted, these processes of selection, admission, incorporation and\r\nassimilation are administered by mere humans and are, therefore,\r\nsubject to human failings. Can qualifications be always judged\r\n\"objectively, unambiguously and unequivocally\"? Can \"the right\r\npersonality traits\" or \"the ability to engage in teamwork\" be evaluated\r\n\"objectively\"? These are vague and ambiguous enough to accommodate bias\r\nand bad will. Still, at least appearances are kept in most cases - and\r\ndecisions can be challenged in courts.\r\n\r\nWhat characterizes oligarchy is the extensive, relentless and ruthless\r\nuse of \"transcendent\" (in lieu of \"inherent\") parameters to decide who\r\nwill belong where, who will get which job and, ultimately, who will\r\nenjoy which benefits. The trouble with transcendent parameters is that\r\nthere is nothing much an applicant or a candidate can do about them.\r\nUsually, they are accidents, occurrences absolutely beyond the reach or\r\ncontrol of those most affected by them. Race is such a transcendent\r\nparameter and so are gender, familial affiliation or contacts and\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nIn many corners of the globe, to join a closed, oligarchic club, to get\r\nthe right job, to enjoy excessive benefits - one must be white\r\n(racism), male (sexual discrimination), born to the right family\r\n(nepotism), or to have the right political (or other) contacts\r\n(cronyism). And often, belonging to one such club is the prerequisite\r\nfor joining another.\r\n\r\nIn France, for instance, the whole country is politically and\r\neconomically run by graduates of the Ecole Normale d'Administration\r\n(ENA). They are known as the ENArques (=the royal dynasty of ENA\r\ngraduates).\r\n\r\nThe privatisation of state enterprises in most East and Central\r\nEuropean countries provided a glaring example of oligarchic\r\nmachinations. In most of these countries (the Czech Republic,\r\nMacedonia, Serbia and Russia are notorious examples) - state companies,\r\nthe nation's only assets, were \"sold\" to political cronies, creating in\r\nthe process a pernicious amalgam of capitalism and oligarchy, known as\r\n\"crony capitalism\" or privateering. The national wealth was passed on\r\nto the hands of relatively few, well connected, individuals, at a\r\nridiculously low price. The nations involved were robbed, their riches\r\neither squandered or smuggled abroad.\r\n\r\nIn the affairs of humans, not everything falls neatly into place. Take\r\nmoney, for instance. Is it an inherent parameter or an expressly\r\ntranscendent one? Making money indicates the existence of some merit,\r\nsome inherent advantageous traits of the moneymaking individual. To\r\nmake money consistently, a person needs to be diligent, resilient, hard\r\nworking, to prevail and overcome hardships, to be far sighted and to\r\npossess a host of other - universally acclaimed - traits. On the other\r\nhand, is it fair when someone who made his fortune through corruption,\r\ninheritance, or luck - be preferred to a poor genius?\r\n\r\nThat is a contentious issue. In the USA money talks. Being possessed of\r\nmoney means being virtuous and meritorious. To preserve a fortune\r\ninherited is as difficult a task as to make it in the first place, the\r\nthinking goes. Thus, the source of the money is secondary.\r\n\r\nAn oligarchy tends to have long term devastating economic effects.\r\n\r\nThe reason is that the best and the brightest - when shut out by the\r\nmembers of the ruling elites - emigrate. In a country where one's job\r\nis determined by his family connections or by influence peddling -\r\nthose best fit to do the job are likely to be disappointed, then\r\ndisgusted and then to leave the place altogether.\r\n\r\nThis is the phenomenon known as \"Brain Drain\". It is one of the biggest\r\nmigratory tidal waves in human history. Capable, well-trained,\r\neducated, young people leave their oligarchic, arbitrary, influence\r\npeddling societies and migrate to less arbitrary meritocracies (mostly\r\nto be found in what is collectively known as \"The West\").\r\n\r\nThis is colonialism of the worst kind. The mercantilist definition of a\r\ncolony is a territory, which exports raw materials only to re-import\r\nthem in the form of finished products. The Brain drain is exactly that:\r\nthe poorer countries are exporting raw brains and buying back the\r\nfinished products masterminded, invented and manufactured by theses\r\nbrains.\r\n\r\nYet, while in classical colonialism, the colony at least received some\r\nrecompense for its goods - here the poor country is actually the poorer\r\nfor its exports. The bright young people who depart (most of them never\r\nto return) carry with them an investment of the scarce resources of\r\ntheir homeland - and award it to their new, much richer, host\r\ncountries. This is an absurd situation, a subsidy granted reluctantly\r\nby the poor to the rich. This is also one of the largest capital\r\ntransfers (really capital flight) in history.\r\n\r\nSome poor countries understood these basic, unpleasant, facts of life.\r\nThey extracted an \"education fee\" from those emigrating. This fee was\r\nsupposed to, at least partially, recapture the costs of educating and\r\ntraining the immigrants. Romania and the USSR imposed such levies on\r\nJews immigrating to Israel in the 1970s. Others despairingly regard the\r\nbrain drain as a natural catastrophe. Very few countries are trying to\r\ntackle the fundamental, structural and philosophical flaws of the\r\nsystem, the roots of the disenchantment of those who leave.\r\n\r\nThe Brain Drain is so serious that some countries lost up to a third of\r\ntheir total young and educated population to it (Macedonia in\r\nSouth-eastern Europe, some less developed countries in South East Asia\r\nand in Africa). Others were drained of almost one half of the growth in\r\ntheir educated workforce (for instance, Israel during the 1980s).\r\n\r\nBrains are an ideal natural resource: they can be cultivated, directed,\r\ncontrolled, manipulated, regulated. They are renewable and replicable.\r\nBrains tend to grow exponentially through interaction and they have an\r\nunparalleled economic value added. The profit margin in knowledge and\r\ninformation related industries far exceeds anything common to more\r\ntraditional, second wave, industries (not to mention first wave\r\nagriculture and agribusiness).\r\n\r\nWhat is even more important:\r\n\r\nPoor countries are uniquely positioned to take advantage of this third\r\nrevolution. With cheap, educated workforce - they can monopolize basic\r\ndata processing and telecommunications functions worldwide. True, this\r\ncalls for massive initial investments in physical infrastructure. But\r\nthe important input is the wetware, the brains. To constrain them, to\r\ndisappoint them, to make them run away, to more merit-orientated places\r\n- is to sentence oneself to a permanent disadvantage and deprivation.\r\n\r\nThis is what the countries in the Balkans are doing. Driving away the\r\nbest part of their population by encouraging the worst part. Abandoning\r\ntheir future by dwelling on their past. Caught in a fatal spider web of\r\nfamily connections and political cronyism of their own design. Their\r\nfactories and universities and offices and government filled to the\r\nbrim with third-rate relatives of third-rate professors and\r\nbureaucrats. Turning themselves into third-rate countries in a\r\nself-perpetuating, self-feeding process of decline. And all the while\r\neyeing the new and the foreign with the paranoia that is the result of\r\ntrue guilt.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Article written on September 8, 1999 and published September 27, 1999\r\n\r\nin \"Central Europe Review\" volume 1, issue 14)\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQuis Custodiet Ipsos Custodes?\r\n\r\n\r\n(Who is Guarding the Guards?)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIzetbegovic, the nominal president of the nominal Bosnian state, the\r\ndarling of the gullible western media, denies that he and his cronies\r\nand his cronies' cronies stole 40% of all civilian aid targeted at\r\nBosnia - a minor matter of 1 billion US dollars and change, in less\r\nthan 4 years. The tribes of the Balkans stop bleeding each other to\r\ndeath only when they gang up to bleed another. In this, there are no\r\nraces and no traces - everyone is equal under the sign of the dollar.\r\nSerbs, Bosnians and Croats divided the loot with the loftiest of\r\negalitarian instincts. Honour among thieves transformed into honour\r\namong victims and their murderers. Mammon is the only real authority in\r\nthis god forsaken, writhing rump of a country.\r\n\r\nAnd not only there.\r\n\r\nIn Russia, billions (3 to 5) were transferred to secret off shore bank\r\naccounts to be \"portfolio managed\" by mysterious fly-by-night entities.\r\nMany paid with their jobs when the trail led to the incestuous Yeltsin\r\nclan and their Byzantine court.\r\n\r\nConvoys snake across the mountainous Kosovo, bringing smuggled goods at\r\nexorbitant prices to the inhabitants of this parched territory - all\r\nunder the avuncular gaze of multinational peacekeepers.\r\n\r\nIn Romania, Hungary and Greece, UN forces have been known to take\r\nbribes to allow goods into besieged Serbia. Oil, weapons and strategic\r\nmaterials, all slid across this greasy channel of the international\r\nbrotherhood of cash.\r\n\r\nA lot of the aid, ostensibly intended to ameliorate the state of\r\nrefugedom imposed upon the unsuspecting, harried population of Kosovo -\r\nresurfaced in markets, white and black, across the region. Food,\r\nblankets, tents, electrical equipment, even toys - were on offer in\r\nbazaars from Skopje to Podgorica and from Sofia to Thessalonica,\r\nreplete with the stamps of the unwitting donors. Aid workers scurried\r\nback and forth in expensive utility vehicles, buzzing mobile phones in\r\nhand and latest model, officially purchased, infrared laptops humming\r\nin the air conditioned coolness of their five star hotel rooms (or\r\nfancy apartments). In their back pockets they safeguarded their first\r\nclass tickets (the food is better and the stewardesses...). The\r\nscavengers of every carnage, they descended upon this tortured land in\r\nredundant hordes, feeding off the misery, the autoimmune deficiency of\r\nthe syndrome of humanism.\r\n\r\nAsk yourselves: how could one of every 3 dollars - 50% of GNP - be\r\nstolen in a country the size of a tiny American state - without the\r\nknowledge and collaboration of the international organizations which\r\nostensibly manage this bedlam? Why did the IMF renew the credit lines\r\nto a Russia, which cheated bold-facedly regarding its foreign exchange\r\nreserves? How was Serbia awash and flush with oil and other goods\r\nprohibited under the terms of the never-ending series of embargoes\r\nimposed upon it?\r\n\r\nThe answer is that potent cocktail of fear and graft. First came fear -\r\nthat Russia will collapse, that the Balkans will spill over, that\r\nBosnia will disintegrate. Nuclear nightmares intermingled with Armenian\r\nand Jewish flashbacks of genocide. The west shut its eyes tight and\r\nthrew money at the bad spirits of irredentism and re-emergent\r\ncommunism. The long arm of the USA, the \"international\" financial\r\ninstitutions, collaborated in constructing the habit forming dole house\r\nthat Eastern and Southern Europe has become. This conflict-reticence,\r\nthese approach-avoidance cycles led to an inevitable collusion between\r\nthe ruling mob families that pass for regimes in these parts of the\r\nplanet - and the unilateral institutions that pass for multilateral\r\nones in the rest of it. An elaborate system of winks and nods, the sign\r\nlanguage of institutional rot and decaying governance, took over.\r\nGreasy palms clapped one another with the eerie silence of conspiracy.\r\nThe world looked away as both - international financial institutions\r\nand corrupt regimes - robbed their constituencies blind. This was\r\nperceived to be the inevitable moral cost of stability. Survival of the\r\nmajority entailed the filthy enrichment of the minority. And the west\r\nacquiesced.\r\n\r\nBut this grand design backfired. Like insidious bacteria, corruption\r\nbreeds violence and hops from host to host. It does not discriminate,\r\nthis plague of black conscience, between east and west. As it infected\r\nthe indigenous, it also affected their guardians. They were all\r\nengulfed by raging greed, by a degradation of the inhibitions and by\r\nthe intoxicating promiscuity of lawlessness. Inebriated by their newly\r\nfound powers, little Caesars - natives and financial colonialists -\r\nclaimed their little plots of crime and avarice, a not so secret order\r\nof disintegration of the social fabric. A ghoulish landscape, shrouded\r\nin the opaque mist of the nomenclature, the camaraderie of the\r\nomnipotent.\r\n\r\nAnd corruption bred violence. The Chicago model imported lock, stock\r\nand the barrel of the gun. Former cronies disappeared mysteriously,\r\nbloated corpses in stale hotel rooms - being the only \"contracts\"\r\nhonoured. Territories were carved up in constant, unrelenting warfare.\r\nOne billion dollars are worth a lot of blood and it was spilled with\r\nglee, with the enthusiasm of the inevitable, with the elation of\r\ngambling all on a single spin of the Russian roulette.\r\n\r\nIt is this very violence that the west tried to drown with its credits.\r\nBut unbeknownst to it, this very violence thrived on these pecuniary\r\nfertilizers. A plant of horrors, it devoured its soil and its\r\ncultivators alike. And 120,000 people paid with their lives for this\r\nwrong gamble. Counting its losses, the west is poised to spin the wheel\r\nagain. More money is amassed, the dies are cast and more people cast to\r\ndie.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Article written on August 23, 1999 and published September 13, 1999\r\n\r\nin \"Central Europe Review\" volume 1, issue 12)\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHerzl's Butlers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJames Cook misled the British government back home by neglecting to\r\nreport about the aborigines he spotted on the beaches of New Holland.\r\nThis convenient omission allowed him to claim the territory for the\r\ncrown. In the subsequent waves of colonization, the aborigines\r\nperished. Modern Australia stands awash in their blood, constructed on\r\ntheir graves, thriving on their confiscated lands. The belated efforts\r\nto redress these wrongs meet with hostility and the atavistic fears of\r\nthe dispossessor.\r\n\r\nIn \"Altneuland\" (translated to Hebrew as \"Tel Aviv\"), the feverish tome\r\ncomposed by Theodore Herzl, Judaism's improbable visionary - Herzl\r\nrefers to the Arabs as pliant and compliant butlers, replete with\r\ngloves and tarbushes. In the book, a German Jewish family prophetically\r\nlands at Jaffa, the only port in erstwhile Palestine. They are welcomed\r\nand escorted by \"Briticized\" Arab gentlemen's gentlemen who are only\r\ntoo happy to assist their future masters and colonizers to disembark.\r\n\r\nIn between these extremes - of annihilation and assimilation - modern\r\nEurope has come up with a plethora of models and solutions to the\r\nquestion of minorities, which plagued it and still does. Two schools of\r\nthought emerged: the nationalistic-ethnic versus the cultural.\r\n\r\nEurope has always been torn between centrifugal and centripetal forces.\r\nMulti-ethnic empires alternated with swarms of mini-states with\r\ndizzying speed. European Unionism clashed with brown-turning-black\r\nnationalism and irredentism. Universalistic philosophies such as\r\nsocialism fought racism tooth and nail. European history became a\r\nblood-dripping pendulum, swung by the twin yet conflicting energies of\r\nseparation and integration. The present is no different. The dream of\r\nthe European Union confronted the nightmare of a dismembered Yugoslavia\r\nthroughout the last decade. And ethnic tensions are seething all across\r\nthe continent. Hungarians in Romania, Slovakia, Ukraine and Serbia,\r\nBulgarians in Moldova, Albanians in Macedonia, Russians in the Baltic\r\ncountries, even Padans in Italy and the list is long.\r\n\r\nThe cultural school of co-existence envisaged multi-ethnic states with\r\nshared philosophies and value systems, which do not infringe upon the\r\nmaintenance and preservation of the ethnic identities of their\r\ncomponents. The first socialists adopted this model enthusiastically.\r\nThey foresaw a multi-ethnic, multi-cultural socialist mega-state. The\r\nsocialist values, they believed, will serve as the glue binding\r\ntogether the most disparate of ethnic elements. In the event, it took a\r\nlot more than common convictions. It took suppression on an\r\nunprecedented scale and it took concentration camps and the morbid\r\napplication of the arts and sciences of death. And even then both the\r\nNazi Reich and the Stalinist USSR fell to ethnic pieces.\r\n\r\nThe national(istic) school supports the formation of ethnically\r\nhomogenous states, if necessary, by humane and gradual (or inhuman and\r\nabrupt) ethnic cleansing. Homogeneity is empirically linked to\r\nstability and, therefore, to peace, economic prosperity and oftentimes\r\nto democracy. Heterogeneity breeds friction, hatred, violence,\r\ninstability, poverty and authoritarianism. The conclusion is simple:\r\nethnicities cannot co-exist. Ethnic groups (a.k.a. nations) must be\r\nleft to their own devices, put differently: they must be allocated a\r\npiece of land and allowed to lead their lives as they see fit. The land\r\nthus allocated should correspond, as closely as possible, with the\r\nbirthplace of the nation, the scenery of its past and the cradle of its\r\nculture.\r\n\r\nThe nationalist school depended on denial and repression of the\r\nexistence of heterogeneity and of national minorities. This was done by:\r\n\r\na. Ethnic Cleansing\r\n\r\nGreece and Turkey exchanged population after the First World War.\r\nCzechoslovakia expelled the Sudeten Germans after the Second World War\r\nand the Nazis rendered big parts of Europe Judenrein. Bulgarians forced\r\nTurks to flee. The Yugoslav succession wars were not wars in the\r\nClausewitz sense - rather they were protracted guerrilla operations\r\nintended to ethnically purge swathes of the \"motherland\".\r\n\r\nb. Ethnic Denial\r\n\r\nIn 1984, the Bulgarian communist regime forced the indigenous Turkish\r\npopulation to \"Bulgarize\" their names. The Slav minorities in the\r\nHungarian part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire were forced to\r\n\"Magyarize\" following the 1867 Compromise. Franco's Spain repressed\r\ndemands for regional autonomy. Other, more democratic states fostered a\r\nsense of national unity by mass media and school indoctrination. Every\r\nfacet of life was subjected to and incorporated in this relentless and\r\nunforgiving pursuit of national identity: sports, chess, national\r\nholidays, heroes, humour. The particularisms of each group gained\r\nmeaning and legitimacy only through and by their incorporation in the\r\nbigger picture of the nation. Thus, Greece denies to this very day that\r\nthere are Turks or Macedonians on its soil. There are only Muslim\r\nGreeks, it insists (often brutally and in violation of human and civil\r\nrights). The separate identities of Brittany and Provence were\r\nsubmerged within the French collective one and so was the identity of\r\nthe Confederate South in the current USA. Some call it \"cultural\r\ngenocide\".\r\n\r\nThe nationalist experiment failed miserably. It was pulverized by a\r\nmillion bombs, slaughtered in battlefields and concentration camps, set\r\nablaze by fanatics and sadists. The pendulum swung. In 1996, Hungarians\r\nwere included in the Romanian government and in 1998 they made it to\r\nthe Slovakian one. In Macedonia, Albanian parties took part in all the\r\ngovernments since independence. The cultural school, on the ascendance,\r\nwas able to offer three variants:\r\n\r\n1. The Local Autonomy\r\n\r\nEthnic minorities are allowed to use their respective languages in\r\ncertain municipalities where they constitute more than a given\r\npercentage (usually twenty) of the total population. Official\r\ndocuments, street signs, traffic tickets and education all are\r\ntranslated to the minority language as well as to the majority's. This\r\nrather meaningless placebo has a surprisingly tranquillizing effect on\r\nrestless youth and nationalistic zealots. In 1997, police fought local\r\nresidents in a few Albanian municipalities precisely on this issue.\r\n\r\n2. The Territorial Autonomy\r\n\r\nEthnic minorities often constitute a majority in a given region. Some\r\n\"host\" countries allow them to manage funds, collect taxes and engage\r\nin limited self-governance. This is the regional or territorial\r\nautonomy that Israel offered to the Palestinians (too late) and that\r\nKosovo and Vojvodina enjoyed under the 1974 Yugoslav constitution\r\n(which Milosevic shredded to very small pieces). This solution was\r\nsometimes adopted by the nationalist competition itself. The Nazis\r\ndreamt up at least two such territorial \"final solutions\" for the Jews\r\n(one in Madagascar and one in Poland). Stalin gave the Jews a decrepit\r\nwasteland, Birobidjan, to be their \"homeland\". And, of course, there\r\nwere the South African \"homelands\".\r\n\r\n3. The Personal Autonomy\r\n\r\nKarl Renner and Otto Bauer advanced the idea of the individual as the\r\nsource of political authority - regardless of his or her domicile.\r\nBetween the two world wars, Estonia gave personal autonomy to its Jews\r\nand Russians. Wherever they were, they were entitled to vote and elect\r\nrepresentatives to bodies of self-government. These had symbolic\r\ntaxation powers but exerted more tangible authority over matters\r\neducational and cultural. This idea, however benign sounding,\r\nencountered grave opposition from right and left alike. The right wing\r\n\"exclusive\" nationalists rejected it because they regarded minorities\r\nthe way a sick person regards his germs. And the left wing,\r\n\"inclusive\", nationalists saw in it the seeds of discrimination, an\r\nanathema.\r\n\r\nHow and why did we find ourselves embroiled in such a mess?\r\n\r\nIt is all the result of the wrong terminology, an example of the power\r\nof words. The Jews (and Germans) came up with the \"objective\",\r\n\"genetic\", \"racial\" and \"organic\" nation. Membership was determined by\r\nexternal factors over which the member-individual had no control. The\r\nFrench \"civil\" model - an 18th century innovation - regarded the nation\r\nand the state as voluntary collectives, bound by codes and values,\r\nwhich are subject to social contracts. Benedict Anderson called the\r\nlatter \"imagined communities\".\r\n\r\nNaturally, it was a Frenchman (Ernest Renan) who wrote:\r\n\r\n\"Nations are not eternal. They had a beginning and they will have an\r\nend. And they will probably be replaced by a European confederation.\"\r\n\r\nHe was referring to the fact that nation STATES were nothing but (at\r\nthe time) a century old invention of dubious philosophical pedigree.\r\nThe modern state was indeed invented by intellectuals (historians and\r\nphilologists) and then solidified by ethnic cleansing and the horrors\r\nof warfare. Jacob Grimm virtually created the chimeral Serbo-Croat\r\n\"language\". Claude Fauriel dreamt up the reincarnation of ancient\r\nGreece in its eponymous successor. The French sociologist and\r\nanthropologist Marcel Mauss remarked angrily that \"it is almost comical\r\nto see little-known, poorly investigated items of folklore invoked at\r\nthe Peace Conference as proof that the territory of this or that nation\r\nshould extend over a particular area because a certain shape of\r\ndwelling or bizarre custom is still in evidence\". Archaeology,\r\nanthropology, philology, history and a host of other sciences and arts\r\nwere invoked in an effort to substantiate a land claim. And no land\r\nclaim was subjected to a statute of limitations, no subsequent conquest\r\nor invasion or settlement legitimised. Witness the \"Dacian wars\"\r\nbetween Hungary and Romania over Transylvania (are the Romanians latter\r\nday Dacians or did they invade Transylvania long after it was populated\r\nby the Hungarians?). Witness the Israelis and the Palestinians. And,\r\nneedless to add, witness the Serbs and the Albanians, the Greeks and\r\nthe Macedonians and the Macedonians and the Bulgarians.\r\n\r\nThus, the modern nation-state was a reflection of something more\r\nprimordial, of human nature itself as it resonated in the national\r\nfounding myths (most of them fictitious or contrived). The\r\nsupra-national dream is to many a nightmare. Europe is fragmenting into\r\nmicro-nations while unifying its economies. These two trends are not\r\nmutually exclusive as is widely and erroneously believed. Actually,\r\nthey are mutually reinforcing. As the modern state loses its major\r\neconomic roles and functions to a larger, supranational framework - it\r\nloses its legitimacy and its raison d'etre.\r\n\r\nThe one enduring achievement of the state was the replacement of\r\nallegiance to a monarch, to a social class, to a region, or to a\r\nreligion by an allegiance to a \"nation\". This subversive idea comes\r\nback to haunt itself. It is this allegiance to the nation that is the\r\nundoing of the tolerant, multi-ethnic, multi-religious, abstract modern\r\nstate. To be a nationalist is to belong to ever smaller and more\r\nhomogenous groups and to dismantle the bigger, all-inclusive polity,\r\nwhich is the modern state.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the state is losing in the battlefield of ideas to the other\r\ntwo options: micro-nationalism (homogeneous and geographically\r\nconfined) and reactionary affiliation. Micro-nationalism gave birth to\r\nPalestine and to Kosovo, to the Basque land and to Quebec, to\r\nregionalism and to local patriotism. It is a fragmenting force. Modern\r\ntechnology makes many political units economically viable despite their\r\nminuscule size - and so they declare their autonomy and often aspire to\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\nReactionary Affiliation is cosmopolitan. Think about the businessman,\r\nthe scholar, the scientist, the pop star, the movie star, the\r\nentrepreneur, the arbitrageur and the Internet. People feel affiliated\r\nto a profession, a social class, a region, or a religion more than they\r\ndo to their state. Hence the phenomena of ex-pats, mass immigration,\r\ninternational managers. This is a throwback to an earlier age when the\r\nmodern state was not yet invented. Indeed, the predicament of the\r\nnation-state is such that going back may be the only benign way of\r\ngoing forward.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Article written on September 5, 1999 and published September 20, 1999\r\n\r\nin \"Central Europe Review\" volume 1, issue 13)\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Phlegm and the Anima\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Impressionistic Canvass\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Calamity\r\n\r\nIt often rains in Skopje nowadays. Sudden, thunderous outpourings of\r\nacidulous and gluey fluid. People say it is the pollution from 12,000\r\ntonnes of bombs dropped 20 km from here. The unions warn of a hot\r\nautumn. The omens are ominous. It looks like an economic crash rather\r\nthan a soft landing. Tony Blair was here a while ago. He photo\r\nopportunities with photogenic refugees and promised the soft spoken and\r\ndreamy eyed Prime Minister of Macedonia 20 million British Pounds. The\r\nmoney never came. Blair's promise went the way of thousands of other\r\npromises made by the good and the mighty throughout the history of this\r\nmelancholy part of the globe.\r\n\r\nEmir Kusturice compared the Balkans to an island, drifting listlessly,\r\nreceding wedding music in the background. It is heart rending and often\r\nprovokes in me a tsunamic pity, an earthquake of goodwill. The locals\r\nare adept at using this resonance, at taking advantage of foreigners\r\nvulnerable to their music, to their costumes, to their rustic\r\nshrewdness.\r\n\r\nIn 1963, upon the occasion of a particularly malicious earthquake,\r\nwhich levelled Skopje - they rebuilt it from generous foreign\r\ndonations. The message sank in: foreigners love disasters, natural and\r\nmanmade. Foreigners are willing to shell hard currency for this\r\nindulgence. The harder the catastrophe - the harder the currency. Thus,\r\ncalamities became an export industry, a major earner of foreign\r\nexchange, the opportunity of a lifetime for a few in exchange for the\r\nmisery of the many.\r\n\r\nThe Aftermath\r\n\r\nMusic drifts in with the fragrances of decaying blossoms and with\r\ncorpulent mosquitoes. The fragmented echoes of animated discussions.\r\nPeople here talk with their whole bodies. They lean forward and touch\r\ntheir conversants. When they meet or depart they kiss each other on the\r\ncheeks and hug passionately. It was, therefore strange to see the body\r\nlanguage of the octogenarian president of Macedonia with his much\r\nyounger Albanian counterpart. They stood apart and made diametrically\r\nopposed declarations about the future of Kosovo. Watching the old\r\ncommunist apparatchik Gligorov, I was reminded or Milosevic when he\r\nannounced the Serb victory in operation Allied Force. He stood so\r\nrigid, as though about to break and leaned towards the camera, creating\r\nan eerie fish lens effect. Balkanians are not proud people, they are\r\nadaptable. But, in an effort to compensate for a deep-set inferiority\r\ncomplex, they react with vanity and narcissism. Co-existence here has\r\nnever been an easy proposition and the Americans forced strange\r\nbedfellows upon each other. Accustomed to the imposing ways of\r\nsuperpowers, the Balkan bowed its head. But it is a contemptuous\r\ngesture. Balkanians aim to win through their surrender. They always\r\nharbour hidden agendas. Knowing this, they are also paranoid but, as\r\ndistinct from the classic pathology, they do have enemies. The Balkan\r\nwill wait until America joins Rome and Turkey. The only commodity it\r\nhas aplenty is time. So now Gligorov and Mejdani shake hands but they\r\nboth know the long knives are drawn. They both will wait for the\r\nintruders to depart, which will them go on with that traditional\r\npastime of Balkan rulers: slaughtering each other.\r\n\r\nThe War Chests\r\n\r\nThaci found himself with plenty of returning refugees, meddlesome\r\npeacekeepers and houses burned to their basements. He also found\r\nhimself with very little money. Rugova and Bukoshi, on the other hand,\r\nhave access to funds but very few adherents. Rugova's decline did not\r\nstart in March 1999. It started long ago when he objected even to\r\npeaceful student demonstrations (which the Serbs found tolerable). It\r\nwas then clear that if there ever was any distinction between his\r\npacifism and traitorous, collaborationist cowardice - it has long\r\nvanished. People deserted him in droves and in Rambouillet, it was\r\nThaci who headed the Kosovar delegation, not his elder rival.\r\n\r\nSo now Thaci needs money. One way is to collect taxes, as Rugova did.\r\nAnother is to monopolize the business interests of Kosovo. He set\r\nhimself upon this task no less ferociously than he did fighting the\r\nSerbs. In collaboration with Albanian politicians (government\r\nsupporters) and with Macedonian politicians of Albanian descent, he\r\nbegan to take over lucrative trades and economic activities both in\r\nKosovo and in its neighbours. The Berisha (Albanian opposition) crowd\r\nregard him as an imminent danger. They believe his aim is to become the\r\nPresident of a Greater Albania comprising Albania and Kosovo (though\r\nnot Macedonia, a new found and perhaps short lived ally). This is a\r\nrecipe for a civil war, the second one within two years in Albania. The\r\nfirst one erupted after the life savings of one third of the population\r\nwere squandered by a cronyist group of investment houses in pyramid\r\nschemes.\r\n\r\nThe Spoils\r\n\r\nThe Greeks are grabbing Macedonian property: real estate, banks,\r\nfactories, and a refinery, perhaps the Macedonian Telecom. They pay\r\noutlandishly cheap prices. The Macedonians are on their knees, reduced\r\nby the war to a loosely connected network of bartering businesses.\r\nWhile plundering, the Greeks do not refrain from political\r\narm-twisting. They vetoed Macedonia's application to become the centre\r\nof the reconstruction of Kosovo and then proceeded to propose\r\nThessalonica (Saloniki) - a proposal adopted by the EU. They also\r\nrefuse to call Macedonia by its constitutional name, forcing the\r\nimpossible acronym FYROM on the international community. The next\r\nlogical target is Serbia. To the Greek businessmen, Kosovo is lost due\r\nto the brutal treatment of Albanian refugees in Greece and the\r\nexpressed pro-Serb sympathies of the Greek main street.\r\n\r\nThus, strange, chimeral alliances emerge. They are likely to prove as\r\nephemeral as their predecessors, to melt away in the searing heat of\r\nthe Balkanian summer. But while they last they give one pause. The\r\nRussians and two NATO members, Greece and Italy, are likely to defy\r\nAmerica and enthusiastically embark upon the lucrative reconstruction\r\nof devastated Serbia. Financed by German money through the inefficient\r\nand corrupt money transfer mechanism known as the EU, German businesses\r\nare not likely to tolerate this Christian Orthodox monopoly. They will\r\njoin the fray, to America's increasing dismay and chagrin. American\r\nfirms, on the other hand, will probably not be allowed to undo the\r\ndamage their government wrought. Left out of the game, America will try\r\nto spoil it. It might well succeed, for it controls the strings of the\r\nAmerican purses known as IMF and World Bank. Americans never hesitate\r\nto bully and to blackmail where money is involved.\r\n\r\nThe Russians are preparing to supply Serbia with new military\r\ntechnology as do other rogue states. Greece is secretly negotiating\r\nwith Iran. Serb leaders visit Iraq. Russians are meeting North Koreans.\r\nSo do the Chinese. Russian aircraft breach NATO's airspace. The\r\nEuropeans are hastily forming their own defence alliance and finally\r\nappointed Mr. PESC, the long awaited EU foreign policy supremo. The\r\nramblings of a new cold war (the world against the USA) are clearly\r\naudible to the attentive ear. In the margins more minor players such as\r\nIsrael position themselves to counter what they regard as dangerous\r\nliaisons between Pakistani, Afghani and Albanian Islamic\r\nfundamentalist, terrorist cum drug concerns (sometimes in the guise of\r\naid organizations). Bin Laden is in the area. Every secret service,\r\nevery crime organization, every terrorist group, every liberation\r\nmovement, every weapons dealer, every drug pusher are here, eager not\r\nto miss the unfolding action.\r\n\r\nThese wrangles will surely depress investors' appetites. They will not\r\nincrease the pledges in bow tied donor conferences either. Good money\r\n(investments and international aid) rarely follows bad one (crime and\r\nweapons trading, for example).\r\n\r\nThe Balkan countries stand to get a small fraction of the magnificent\r\nand magnanimous and generous promises made to them in the heat of the\r\nbattle. The Balkan will be forgotten because it refuses to reform,\r\nbecause it is obstreperous. The number of officials visiting will\r\ndecline. The journalists will beat a path to other blazes. The local\r\npoliticians, pampered by the likes of Clinton and the CNN will revert\r\nunwillingly to their petty squabbles and ragged local papers. In a few\r\nmonths, it is will all seem like a mirage. It will all sink into the\r\nfertile soil of this luscious region, fertilized by countless bodies\r\nand bloody rivulets. The great togetherness will evaporate leaving\r\nbehind the putrid fumes of re-emerging, centuries old, grudges and\r\nsuspicions. The people will complain. The leaders will thieve and\r\ncollaborate with organized crime. The criminals will prosper. The\r\nfarmers will toil their land and intellectuals will conspire. It is the\r\nBalkans where nothing changes.\r\n\r\nAnd nothing ever will.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Article written on July 11, 1999 and published July 19, 1999\r\n\r\nin \"Central Europe Review\" volume 1, issue 4)\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dance of Jael\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Envy is forever looking upwards. It does not look sideways. In 'Facial\r\nJustice' Hartley (1960) describes a life after a catastrophic war. A\r\nDictator has decreed that envy is so destructive that it has to be\r\neliminated. The citizens are coerced to be as alike each other as\r\npossible. The worst crime is not envy itself but to excite envy.\r\n'Equality and Envy - the two E's were...the positive and negative poles\r\non which the New State rotated' (p.12). In order to exterminate envy\r\neverything that was enviable has been destroyed. Of course that in\r\nitself is the very essence of envy. Neither envy nor equality are\r\nspoken of as words but referred to as Good and Bad E. All tall\r\nbuildings had been destroyed in the war except the tower of Ely\r\nCathedral and none are allowed to be built - a horizontal view of life\r\nis required. No comparisons are to be made, women are encouraged to\r\nundertake an operation so they all looked alike, to be pretty would\r\nexcite envy. The result is that the populace loses its humanity and\r\nbecomes a non-thinking mass. The independently minded heroine, Jael,\r\nvisits the Ely and looks up at the tower and leads a dance round it.\r\nShe pays the price of having her more than averagely pretty face (an\r\nAlpha face) changed to a Beta face by cosmetic surgery and so made\r\nindistinguishable from the others.\"\r\n\r\n(From \"Cronos and His Children - Envy and Reparation\" by Mary Ashwin -\r\nChapter II \"Everyday Envy\")\r\n\r\n\r\nThe distinction between fiction and non-fiction became ever subtler in\r\nthe \"Underground\" world of post-socialism, \"After the Rain\" of\r\ncommunism. In a lethal embrace, in an act of unprecedented intercourse,\r\nliterature penetrated reality as only the most fervent lovers or the\r\nmost avid haters do. A topsy-turvy continent adrift among the gales of\r\nnewspeak, under the gaze of a million grey bureaucrats passing for big\r\nbrothers. A motion picture gone awry: the plot long forgotten, the\r\nactors wondering forlornly on a dilapidated scene and the credits\r\nflashing over and again, in an endless loop.\r\n\r\nThis crazed landscape, this party of mad hatters, where time stood\r\nstill was the result of the two great equalizers: oppression and\r\nideology. The substrate of numerous experiments of groups without\r\ncontrol, the inhabitants of these feverish lands internalised their own\r\npredicament. The broken toys of spoiled imperial children, the guinea\r\npigs of scientific materialism and then of materialism only - they\r\nstrutted around, eyes wide shut, ears clogged, mouths stapled, lips\r\nsown with the wire of terror. Everyone was equal under their occupiers,\r\ntheir tormentors, and their slave masters. And everyone was equal by\r\ndecree, on pain of death or exile, by the horror-stricken conviction\r\ncalled ideology. To succumb to the former was to survive - to subscribe\r\nto the latter was to flourish. Many flourished.\r\n\r\nThe New Oxford Dictionary of English defines envy as: \"A feeling of\r\ndiscontented or resentful longing aroused by someone else's\r\npossessions, qualities, or luck.\" And an earlier version (The Shorter\r\nOxford English Dictionary) adds: \"Mortification and ill will occasioned\r\nby the contemplation of another's superior advantages.\"\r\n\r\nPathological envy - the second deadly sin - is a compounded emotion. It\r\nis brought on by the realization of some lack, deficiency, or\r\ninadequacy in oneself. It is the result of unfavourably comparing\r\noneself to others: to their success, their reputation, their\r\npossessions, their luck, and their qualities. It is misery and\r\nhumiliation and impotent rage and a tortuous, slippery path to nowhere.\r\nThe effort to break the padded walls of this self-visited purgatory\r\noften leads to attacks on the perceived source of frustration.\r\n\r\nPathological envy is THE driving force of post-communist Central and\r\nEastern Europe. Unable to cope with the sudden shift in values from\r\nenforced and artificial equality to primitive, pirate capitalism - the\r\npopulace retreated to acrimony and bitterness. Faced with the chasmic\r\ninequalities engendered by the serial collective robberies known as\r\n\"privatisation\" - it reacted with suppressed rage, with despair, with\r\nthe multiple sadness which is nostalgia. The land has split between a\r\ncolourful, dynamic, rapacious and omnivorous class - and the sepia-like\r\nand quaint backdrop of their compatriots. As the castles of the former\r\nrose - so were the abodes of the latter humbled.\r\n\r\nThe resentment led to fears of abandoning one's self-control, of\r\nconfronting one's rulers and their cronies, of losing even the little\r\none was allowed to possess. It was a muted mutiny, a rebel-less\r\nrebellion, a static trip from guilt to hate. To maintain these seething\r\nundercurrents from erupting, to avoid the volcanic tremors that precede\r\nevery revolution - behaviour was formalized and ritualised. Speech\r\nbecame ever vaguer and ambiguous. Effective communication was halted.\r\nThe community splintered and the very fabric of society was consumed by\r\nthis massive act of dissociation.\r\n\r\nPathological envy mutated into solutions the envious could live with.\r\n\r\nSome sought to imitate or even emulate the newfound heroes of the\r\ncapitalist revolution. They immersed themselves in conspicuous\r\nconsumption, the badly matched purchases of the nouveaux riches replete\r\nwith the vulgar manners of unrefined power. They adhered to coarse\r\nmaterialism with its confusion of ends and means. They suffered the\r\never-present agitation of envy, the constant comparison to one's\r\nsuperiors, the plagued rat race. To get rich quick through schemes of\r\ncrime and corruption is thought by these people to be the epitome of\r\ncleverness (providing one does not get caught), the sport of living, a\r\nwinked-at vice, a spice.\r\n\r\nYet others embarked on paths of rivalry and enmity and destruction.\r\nThis hydra has many heads. From scratching the paint of new cars and\r\nflattening their tyres, to spreading vicious gossip, to media-hyped\r\narrests of successful and rich businessmen, to wars against advantaged\r\nneighbours. The stifling, condensed vapours of envy cannot be\r\ndispersed. They invade their victims and snatch their rageful eyes,\r\ntheir calculating souls, they guide their hands in evil doings and dip\r\ntheir tongues in vitriol. This is the day-to-day existence in places as\r\nfar apart as Moscow and the Balkans. A constant hiss, a tangible\r\nmalice, the piercing of a thousand eyes. The imminence and immanence of\r\nviolence. The poisoned joy of depriving the other of that which you do\r\nnot or cannot have.\r\n\r\nThere are those who idealize the successful and the rich and the lucky.\r\nThey attribute to them super-human, almost divine, qualities. They\r\nthink of serendipity as earned, of work as bestowed, of success as\r\ndeserved and reserved to the deserving. In an effort to justify the\r\nagonizing disparities between themselves and others, they humble\r\nthemselves as they elevate the others. They reduce and diminish their\r\nown gifts, they disparage their own achievements, they degrade their\r\nown possessions and look with disdain and contempt upon their nearest\r\nand dearest, who are unable to discern their fundamental shortcomings.\r\nThey feel worthy only of abasement and punishment. Besieged by guilt\r\nand remorse, voided of self-esteem, self-hating and self-deprecating -\r\nthis is by far the more dangerous species. For he who derives\r\ncontentment from his own humiliation cannot but derive happiness from\r\nthe downfall of others. Indeed, most of them end up driving the objects\r\nof their own devotion and adulation to destruction and decrepitude.\r\n\r\nBut the most common reaction is the good old cognitive dissonance. In\r\nCentral and Eastern Europe, entire societies are in its grip. It is to\r\nprefer the belief that the grapes are sour to the admission of their\r\ndesirability. These people devalue the source of their frustration and\r\nenvy. They find faults, unattractive features, high costs to pay,\r\nimmorality in everything they really most desire and aspire to and in\r\neveryone who has attained that which they so often can't. They walk\r\naround critical and self-righteous, inflated with a justice of their\r\nmaking and secure in the wisdom of being what they are rather than what\r\nthey could have been and really wish to be. They make a virtue of\r\nabstention, of wishful constipation, of judgmental neutrality, this\r\noxymoron, the favourite of the disabled.\r\n\r\nTopped by a thin layer of coagulated fat, a bubble of enraged and\r\nmaddened envy is boiling underneath - from Murmansk to Athens and from\r\nPrague to Dresden. Will it burst and spill over or will it only noisily\r\nrelease its steam is anybody's guess. It is a force to reckon with. The\r\ntide of capitalism has lifted few yachts and no one else's boats.\r\nPeople feel cheated. They feel used and abused. They feel conned out of\r\ntheir dignity and their possessions and their future. They look around\r\nand see island castles surrounded by oceans of physical and moral\r\nfilth. This is no decadence because it has no aesthetic values to\r\nameliorate it. It is as ugly as the survival of the thiefest. As\r\nCentral and Eastern Europe engages, for the first time, in serious\r\nrestructuring - the social costs will mount dramatically and so will\r\ninequality. The process can be reversed only by the redistribution of\r\nwealth. But that it will be achieved through progressive taxation\r\nrather than through a bloodbath is not a foregone conclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Article written on September 26, 1999 and published October 11, 1999\r\n\r\nin \"Central Europe Review\" volume 1, issue 16)\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHomo Balkanus\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow does one respond to a torrent of belligerent correspondence from\r\nBalkanians arguing against the belligerence of Balkanians asserted by\r\none in one's articles? Were it not sad, it surely would have been\r\nfarcical. Only yesterday (August 17th, 1999 - five months after the\r\nKosovo conflict) Macedonian papers argued fiercely, vehemently and\r\nthreateningly against an apparently innocuous remark by Albania's Prime\r\nMinister. He said that all Albanians, wherever they are, should share\r\nthe same curriculum of studies. A preparatory step on the way to a\r\nGreater Albania perhaps? In this region of opaque mirrors and \"magla\"\r\n(fog) it is possible. And what is possible surely IS.\r\n\r\nI do not believe in the future of this part of the world only because I\r\nknow its history too well. Every psychologist will tell you that past\r\nviolent behaviour is the best predictor of future recidivism. Homo\r\nBalkanus is lifted straight off the rustling pages of the Diagnostic\r\nand Statistics Manual (DSM) version IV (1994) - the bible of the\r\npsychiatric profession:\r\n\r\n\"A pervasive pattern of grandiosity (in fantasy or behaviour), need for\r\nadmiration, and lack of empathy, beginning by early adulthood and\r\npresent in a variety of contexts, as indicated by five (or more) of the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n1. Has a grandiose sense of self-importance (e.g., exaggerates\r\nachievements and talents, expects to be recognized as superior without\r\ncommensurate achievements);\r\n\r\n2. Is preoccupied with fantasies of unlimited success, power,\r\nbrilliance, beauty, or ideal love;\r\n\r\n3. Believes that he or she is 'special' and unique and can only be\r\nunderstood by, or should associate with, other special or high-status\r\npeople (or institutions);\r\n\r\n4.

Lacks empathy: is unwilling to recognize or identify with the\r\nfeelings and needs of others;\r\n\r\n8. Is often envious of others or believes that others are envious\r\nof him or her;\r\n\r\n9. Shows arrogant, haughty behaviours or attitudes.\"\r\n\r\nNarcissism is a result of stunted growth and of childhood abuse. It is\r\na reactive pattern, the indelible traces of an effort to survive\r\nagainst all odds, against bestial repression and all-pervasive decay.\r\nBrutally suppressed by the Turks for hundreds of years and then by\r\ncommunism in some countries and by cruel, capricious banana republic\r\nregimes in others - Homo Balkanus has grown to be a full-fledged\r\nnarcissist.\r\n\r\nThe nation state structure and ideology enthusiastically adopted by\r\nHomo Balkanus in the wake of the collapse of the rotten Ottoman edifice\r\n- has proven to be a costly mistake. Tribal village societies are not\r\nfit for the consumption of abstract models of political organization.\r\nThis is as true in Africa as it is in the Balkans. The first allegiance\r\nof Homo Balkanus is to his family, his clan, and his village. Local\r\npatriotism was never really supplanted by patriotism. Homo Balkanus\r\nshares an Ottoman unconscious with his co-regionists. The \"authorities\"\r\nwere and are always perceived to be a brutal, menacing and\r\nunpredictable presence, a natural power, to be resisted by the equal\r\nemployment of cunning and corruption. Turkish habits die hard. The\r\nnatives find it difficult not to bribe their way through their own\r\nofficialdom, to pay taxes, not to litter, to volunteer, in short: to be\r\ncitizens, rather than occupants or inhabitants. Their\r\npassive-aggressive instincts are intact and on autopilot.\r\n\r\nThe Balkanian experiment with nation states has visited only misery and\r\ncarnage upon the heads of its perpetrators. Borders tracked\r\nconvulsively the movements of half-nomad populations. This instability\r\nof boundaries led to ethnic cleansing, to numerous international\r\ncongresses, to fitful wars. In an effort to justify a distinct\r\nexistence and identity, thousands of \"scholars\" embarked on Herculean\r\nefforts of inventing histories for their newly emergent nations.\r\nInevitably, these histories conflicted and led to yet more bloodshed. A\r\nland fertilized by blood produces harvests of bloated corpses.\r\n\r\nIn the Balkans people fight for their very own identity. They aspire to\r\npurity, albeit racial, and to boundaries, albeit of the abstract kind.\r\nIt is, perhaps, the kernel of this Greek tragedy: that real people are\r\nsacrificing real people on the altar of the abstract. It is a battle of\r\ntastes, a clash of preferences, an Armageddon of opinions, judgements,\r\nand lessons. Armies are still moved by ancient events, by symbols, by\r\nfiery speeches, by abstract, diffuse notions. It is a land devoid of\r\nits present, where the past and future reign supreme. No syllogism, no\r\nlogic, no theory can referee that which cannot be decided but by the\r\ncompelling thrust of the sword. \"We versus They\" - they, the aliens.\r\nThreatened by the otherness of others, Homo Balkanus succumbs to the\r\nprotection of the collective. A dual track: an individualist against\r\nthe authorities - a mindless robot against all others, the foreigners,\r\nthe strangers, the occupiers. The violent acting out of this\r\nschizophrenia is often referred to as \"the history of the Balkans\".\r\n\r\nThis spastic nature was further exacerbated by the egregious behaviour\r\nof the superpowers. Unfortunately possessed of strategic import, the\r\nBalkan was ravaged by geopolitics. Turks and Bulgarians and Hungarians\r\nand Austrians and Russians and Britons and Germans and Communists and\r\nthe warplanes of NATO - the apocalyptic horsemen in the mountains and\r\nrivers and valleys and sunsets of this otherworldly, tortured piece of\r\nland. Raped by its protectors, impregnated by the demon seeds of global\r\ninterests and their ruthless pursuit - the Balkan was transformed into\r\na horror chamber of amputated, zombie nations, a veritable hellish\r\nscene. Many a Pomeranian grenadier bequeathed their bones to the\r\nBalkans but Pomeranian grenadiers came and went while the people of the\r\nBalkan languished.\r\n\r\nThus, it was not difficult to foster a \"We\" against every \"They\" (or\r\nimagined \"They\"). A crossroads of fault lines, a confluence of tectonic\r\nclashes - the Balkan always obliged.\r\n\r\nReligion came handy in this trade of hate. Orthodox Serbs fought Muslim\r\nSerbs in Bosnia (the latter were forced to convert by the Turks\r\nhundreds of years ago). Catholic Croats fought Orthodox Serbs. And\r\nBulgarians (a Turkic tribe) expelled the Turks in 1989, having\r\ncompelled them to change their Muslim names to Bulgarian sounding ones\r\nin 1984.\r\n\r\nRace was useful in the agitated effort to prevail. Albanians are of\r\nIllyrian origin. The Greeks regard the Macedonians as upstart Slavs.\r\nThe Bulgarians regard the Macedonians as rebel Bulgarians. The\r\nMacedonian regard the Bulgarians as Tartars (that is, Barbarian and\r\nTurkish). The Slovenes and the Croats and, yes, the Hungarians claim\r\nnot to belong in this cauldron of seething, venomous emotions.\r\n\r\nAnd culture was used abundantly in the Balkan conflicts. Where was the\r\nCyrillic alphabet invented (Macedonia, Greece, Bulgaria) and by whom\r\n(Greeks, Macedonians, Bulgarians). Are some nations mere inventions?\r\n(The Bulgarians say this about the Macedonians). Are some languages one\r\nand the same? Minorities are either cleansed or denied out of\r\nexistence. The Greek still claim that there are no minorities in\r\nGreece, only Greeks with different religions. The Bulgars in Greece\r\nused to be \"Bulgarophone Greeks\". The Balkan is the eternal hunting\r\ngrounds of oxymorons, tautologies and logical fallacies.\r\n\r\nIt is here that intellectuals usually step in (see my article: \"The\r\nPoets and the Eclipse\"). But the Balkan has no intelligentsia in the\r\nRussian or even American sense. It has no one to buck the trend, to\r\nplay the non-conforming, to rattle, to provoke, to call upon one's\r\nconscience. It does not have this channel to (other) ideas and view\r\ncalled \"intellectuals\". It is this last point, which makes me the most\r\npessimistic. The Balkan is a body without a brain.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Article written on August 8, 1999 and published September 6, 1999\r\n\r\nin \"Central Europe Review\" volume 1, issue 11)\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe MinMaj Rule\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a Roma (gypsy) cleaning lady. She cleans my house every\r\nfortnight. She is nice and well spoken. She values education and good\r\nmanners. She is spotless, obsessively purgatory, and compulsively tidy.\r\nAnd she hates \"shiptars\" (the derogatory name assigned to Macedonian\r\nAlbanians). They are dirty, she says, and criminal and they have too\r\nmany children. They don't respect their women. She is afraid of them.\r\nHer eyes glow with the gratification of the underdog turned top dog, if\r\nonly verbally, if only for a while, if only while cleansing my house.\r\nThis is the way it is, a chain of abuse, a torrent of prejudice, an\r\niron curtain of malice and stereotyping. Czechs portray \"their\" gypsies\r\nwith the same lingual brushstrokes, the same venomous palette, a\r\ncanvass of derision and atavistic, reflexive hatred.\r\n\r\nIn the Balkans reigns supreme the Law of the MinMaj. It is simple and\r\nit was invariably manifested throughout history. It is this: \"Wars\r\nerupt whenever and wherever a country has a minority of the same\r\nethnicity as the majority in its neighbouring country.\"\r\n\r\nConsider Israel - surrounded by Arab countries, it has an Arab minority\r\nof its own, having expelled (ethnically cleansed) hundreds of thousands\r\nmore. It has fought 6 wars with its neighbours and (good intentions\r\nnotwithstanding) looks set to fight more. It is subjugated to the Law\r\nof the MinMaj, enslaved by its steady and nefarious domination.\r\n\r\nOr take Nazi Germany. World War Two was the ultimate manifestation of\r\nthe MinMaj Law. German minorities throughout Europe were either used by\r\nGermany - or actively collaborated with it - to justify one Anschluss\r\nafter another. Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, France, Russia - a\r\nparade of Big Brotherly intervention by Germany on behalf of allegedly\r\nsuppressed kinfolk. Lebensraum and Volkdeutsch were twin pillars of\r\nNazi ideology.\r\n\r\nAnd, of course, there is Yugoslavia, its charred remnants agonizingly\r\nwrithing in a post Kosovo world. Serbia fought Croatia and Bosnia and\r\nKosovo to protect besieged and hysterical local Serbs. Croats fought\r\nSerbs and Bosnians to defend dilapidated Croat settlements. Albanians\r\nfought the Serbs through the good services of Kosovars in order to\r\nprotect Kosovars. And the fighting is still on. This dismembered\r\norganism, once a flourishing country, dazed and scorched, still\r\nattempts to blindly strike its former members, inebriated by its own\r\nblood. Such is the power of the MinMaj.\r\n\r\nThere are three ways out from the blind alley to which the MinMaj Rule\r\ninevitably and invariably leads its adherents. One exit is through\r\nethnic cleansing, the other via self-determination, the third is in\r\nestablishing a community, a majority of minorities.\r\n\r\nEthnic cleansing is the safest route. It is final, irreversible, just,\r\nfast, easy to carry out and preventive as much as curative. It need not\r\nbe strewn with mass graves and smouldering villages. It can be done\r\npeacefully, by consent or with the use of minimal force. It can be part\r\nof a unilateral transfer or of a bilateral exchange of population.\r\nThere are many precedents - Germans in the Ukraine and in\r\nCzechoslovakia, Turks in Bulgaria, Jews in the Arab countries. None of\r\nthem left willingly or voluntarily. All were the victims of\r\npathological nostalgia, deep, disconsolate grieving and the\r\npost-traumatic shock of being uprooted and objectified. But they\r\nemigrated, throngs of millions of people, planeloads, trainloads,\r\ncartloads and carloads of them and they reached their destinations\r\nalive and able to start all over again - which is more than can be said\r\nabout thousands of Kosovar Albanians. Ethnic cleansing has many faces,\r\nbrutality is not its integrated feature.\r\n\r\nThe Wilsonian ideal of self-determination is rarely feasible or\r\npossible - though, when it is, it is far superior to any other\r\nresolution of intractable ethnic conflicts. It does tend to produce\r\npolitical and economic stillborns, though. Ultimately, these offspring\r\nof noble principle merge again with their erstwhile foes within customs\r\nunions, free trade agreements, currency unions. They are subsumed in\r\nother economic, political, or military alliances and gladly surrender\r\npart of that elusive golden braid, their sovereignty. Thus, becoming an\r\nindependent political entity is, to most, a rite of passage,\r\nadolescence, heralding the onset of political adulthood and\r\ngeopolitical and economic maturity.\r\n\r\nThe USA and, to a lesser degree, the UK, France and Germany are fine\r\nexamples of the third way. A majority of minorities united by common\r\nrules, beliefs and aspirations. Those are tension filled structures\r\nsustained by greed or vision or fear or hope and sometimes by the very\r\ntensions that they generate. No longer utopian, it is a realistic model\r\nto emulate.\r\n\r\nIt is only when ethnic cleansing is combined with self-determination\r\nthat a fracturing of the solutions occurs. Atrocities are the vile\r\ndaughters of ideals. Armed with stereotypes - those narcissistic\r\ndefence mechanisms that endow their propagators with a fleeting sense\r\nof superiority - an ethnic group defines itself negatively, in\r\nopposition to another. Self-determination is employed to facilitate\r\nethnic cleansing rather than to prevent it. Actually, it is the very\r\nact of ethnic cleansing which validates the common identity, which\r\nforms the myth and the ethos that is national history, which\r\nperpetrates itself by conferring resilience upon the newly determined\r\nand by offering a common cause and the means to feel efficient,\r\nfunctional and victorious in carrying it out.\r\n\r\nThere are many variants of this malignant, brutal, condemnable,\r\ncriminal and inefficient form of ethnic cleansing. Bred by manic and\r\nhysterical nationalists, fed by demagogues, nourished by the hitherto\r\ndeprived and humiliated - this cancerous mix of definition by negation\r\nwears many guises. It is often clad in legal attire. Israel has a Law\r\nof Return, which makes an instant citizen out of every spouse of every\r\nRussian Jew while denying this privilege to Arabs born on its soil.\r\nSouth Africa had apartheid. Nazi Germany had the Nuremberg Laws. The\r\nCzech Republic had the infamous Benes Decrees. But ethnic cleansing can\r\nbe economic (ask the Chinese in Asia and the Indians in Africa). It can\r\nbe physical (Croatia, Kosovo). It has myriad facets.\r\n\r\nThe West is to blame for this confusion. By offering all three\r\nsolutions as mutually inclusive rather than mutually exclusive - it has\r\nbeen responsible for a lot of strife and misery. But, to its credit, it\r\nhas learned its lesson. In Kosovo it defended the right of the indigent\r\nand (not so indigent but) resident Albanians to live in peace and\r\nplough their land in peace and bring forth children in peace and die in\r\npeace. But it has not protected their right to self-determination. It\r\nhas not mixed the signals. As a result the message came through loud\r\nand clear. And, for the first time in many years, people tuned in and\r\nlistened. And this, by far, is the most important achievement of\r\nOperation Allied Force.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Article written on July 4, 1999 and published July 12, 1999\r\n\r\nin \"Central Europe Review\" volume 1, issue 3)\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Balkans between Omerta and Vendetta\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the Criminality of Transition\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a State Department briefing on Thursday, August 5th, 1999, the\r\nspokesman of this venerable and ever-so-truthful organ of the American\r\nadministration, James Rubin, said:\r\n\r\n\"We have supported and continue to support the regime in Montenegro\r\nthat is a democratic regime that has pursued a democratic course. We do\r\nbelieve that Milosevic's efforts to consolidate power have led to\r\nrepeated violations of the Yugoslav federal constitution, in particular\r\nthe rights and privileges of Montenegro.\r\n\r\nIn particular, Belgrade has sought to strip Montenegro's constitutional\r\nrights and powers and has prevented Montenegro from playing its\r\nconstitutional role in the federal government. We continue to believe\r\nthat Montenegro's leaders have demonstrated a measured and rational\r\napproach to political and economic reform, which we support. We commend\r\ntheir efforts to work within the FRY for reforms that would bring\r\ndemocracy and a better life to all Yugoslav citizens.\r\n\r\nTo achieve that objective, we've been providing them assistance, we've\r\nbeen exempting them from the effect of certain policies that apply to\r\nBelgrade and the people of Serbia. We worked very, very hard during the\r\nwar to avoid any unnecessary damage to facilities or people in\r\nMontenegro as a result of the air war. So we have been showing, I\r\nthink, great efforts to try to build up the democratic efforts that\r\nPresident Djukanovic has shown in Montenegro. We think that they should\r\ncontinue to work within Yugoslavia to ensure their rights are\r\nprotected.\"\r\n\r\nThe war in Kosovo and the impending war in Montenegro and the wars that\r\nwere in Croatia and Bosnia - were all gangland warfare. These were\r\nskirmishes between gangs of criminals, disguised as statesmen,\r\npoliticians, members of \"parliaments\" and businessmen. Some of them\r\nwere protecting their turf - others were trying to usurp it and they\r\nall made a killing, often literally. It is the same the world over -\r\nfrom Lebanon to Myanmar, from Sierra Leone to Nigeria and from Sarajevo\r\nand its ephemeral Stability Pact to the killing fields of Pristina.\r\nCrime gangs, Mafiosi, local versions of omertas and vendettas, black\r\nhands and red rivulets of the cheapest liquid of them all: blood.\r\n\r\nShadowy dealings, drug trafficking, white slavery, smuggling and\r\nforfeit goods are all intertwined with political power in the Balkans.\r\nThaci we discussed elsewhere. Milosevic we discussed everywhere. But\r\nDjukanovic is portrayed as different - more gentlemanly, \"democratic\",\r\na protector of civil rights.\r\n\r\nNothing can be further from the truth. The West - notably the USA - is\r\nin the habit of creating pairs of villains and heroes, monsters and\r\nsaints where there are none. It provides for good soundbites, it raises\r\nthe fighting spirits at home and it focuses attention and energy on the\r\nenemy. Very often, the spin-doctors are caught in their own whirlwind\r\nand with them - if they happen to be American - the rest of the world.\r\nShrewd villagers such as all Balkan politicians are, have caught on to\r\nthis self-delusion. They pose as democrats, autocrats, strong men,\r\nunderdogs - anything to get Western aid and investment flowing. It is\r\ncurrently very fashionable and expedient to be a democrat - so Mr.\r\nDjukanovic is a democrat. And the West duly delivers the goods:\r\ninternational recognition, money, and political support.\r\n\r\nMilka Tadic is the Editor of the popular (and, as you will see,\r\nindependent) Montenegrin magazine \"Monitor\". This week, she wrote about\r\nDjukanovich (in \"Currency Wars\", in IWPR number 63):\r\n\r\n\"Whenever Djukanovic, then Montenegro's Prime Minister, demanded\r\neconomic liberalization and more economic independence, Milosevic would\r\nclose the border and block trade between Serbia and Montenegro. In\r\nretaliation, Djukanovic opened Montenegro's borders with Italy, to\r\ncigarette smuggling, and with Albania, for oil imports. Djukanovic also\r\nliberalized the import of foreign, second-hand cars - many of them\r\nstolen vehicles from Western Europe that Montenegrins bought from the\r\nBosnian-Croat mafia, in border towns in Bosnia. Taxes from imported\r\ncars, the smuggling of cigarettes and oil, provided Djukanovic with the\r\nhard currency to replenish the republic's coffers and begin to chart an\r\nindependent course away from Belgrade. In economic terms, this tiny\r\nrepublic was becoming less and less dependent on its partner in the\r\nYugoslav federation. ... As NATO launched its bombing campaign, the\r\nYugoslav Army took over control of the Montenegrin border crossings and\r\ncustom posts, banning even the entrance of humanitarian aid; speed\r\nboats smuggling cigarettes between Montenegro and Italy could no longer\r\nbreak the blockade; and the border with Albania was also closed.\r\nDjukanovic was facing economic disaster and was only saved by the end\r\nof the war, since when Montenegro has resumed its dubious trade with\r\nits neighbours.\"\r\n\r\nHence the love affair with the West.\r\n\r\nHuman vice is the most certain thing after death and taxes, to\r\nparaphrase Benjamin Franklin. The only variety of economic activity,\r\nwhich will surely survive even a nuclear holocaust, is bound to be\r\ncrime. Prostitution, gambling, drugs and, in general, expressly illegal\r\nactivities generate c. 400 billion USD annually to their perpetrators,\r\nthus making crime the third biggest industry on Earth (after the\r\nmedical and pharmaceutical industries).\r\n\r\nMany of the so-called Economies in Transition and of HPICs (Highly\r\nIndebted Poor Countries) do resemble post-nuclear-holocaust ashes. GDPs\r\nin most of these economies either tumbled nominally or in real terms by\r\nmore than 60% in the space of less than a decade. The average monthly\r\nsalary is the equivalent of the average daily salary of the German\r\nindustrial worker. The GDP per capita - with very few notable\r\nexceptions - is around 20% of the EU's average. These are the telltale\r\novert signs of a comprehensive collapse of the infrastructure and of\r\nthe export and internal markets. Mountains of internal debt, sky-high\r\ninterest rates, cronyism, other forms of corruption, environmental,\r\nurban and rural dilapidation - characterize these economies.\r\n\r\nInto this vacuum - the interregnum between centrally planned and free\r\nmarket economies - crept crime. In most of these countries criminals\r\nrun at least half the economy, are part of the governing elites\r\n(influencing them behind the scenes through money contributions,\r\noutright bribes, or blackmail) and - through the mechanism of money\r\nlaundering - infiltrate slowly the legitimate economy.\r\n\r\nWhat gives crime the edge, the competitive advantage versus the older,\r\nostensibly better established elites?\r\n\r\nThe free market does. Criminals are much better equipped to deal with\r\nthe onslaught of this new conceptual beast, the mechanism of the\r\nmarket, than most other economic players in these tattered economies\r\nare.\r\n\r\nCriminals, by the very nature of their vocation, were always private\r\nentrepreneurs. They were never state owned or subjected to any kind of\r\ncentral planning. Thus, they became the only group in society that was\r\nnot corrupted by these un-natural inventions. They invested their own\r\ncapital in small to medium size enterprises and ran them later as any\r\nAmerican manager would have done. To a large extent the criminals,\r\nsingle handedly, created a private sector in these derelict economies.\r\n\r\nHaving established a private sector business, devoid of any involvement\r\nof the state, the criminal-entrepreneurs proceeded to study the market.\r\nThrough primitive forms of market research (neighbourhood activists)\r\nthey were able to identify the needs of their prospective customers, to\r\nmonitor them in real time and to respond with agility to changes in the\r\npatterns of supply and demand. Criminals are market-animals and they\r\nare geared to respond to its gyrations and vicissitudes. Though they\r\nwere not likely to engage in conventional marketing and advertising,\r\nthey always stayed attuned to the market's vibrations and signals. They\r\nchanged their product mix and their pricing to fit fluctuations in\r\ndemand and supply.\r\n\r\nCriminals have proven to be good organizers and managers. They have\r\nvery effective ways of enforcing discipline in the workplace, of\r\nsetting revenue targets, of maintaining a flexible hierarchy combined\r\nwith rigid obeisance - with very high upward mobility and a clear\r\ncareer path. A complex system of incentives and disincentives drives\r\nthe workforce to dedication and industriousness. The criminal rings are\r\nwell run conglomerates and the more classic industries would have done\r\nwell to study their modes of organization and management. Everything -\r\nfrom sales through territorially exclusive licences (franchises) to\r\neffective \"stock\" options - has been invented in the international\r\ncrime organizations long before it acquired the respectability of the\r\ncorporate boardroom.\r\n\r\nThe criminal world has replicated those parts of the state, which were\r\nrendered ineffective by unrealistic ideology or by pure corruption. The\r\ncourt system makes a fine example. The criminals instituted their own\r\ncode of justice (\"law\") and their own court system. A unique - and\r\noften irreversible - enforcement arm sees to it that respect towards\r\nthese indispensable institutions is maintained. Effective - often\r\ninteractive - legislation, an efficient court system, backed by ominous\r\nand ruthless agents of enforcement - ensure the friction-free\r\nfunctioning of the giant wheels of crime. Crime has replicated numerous\r\nother state institutions. Small wonder that when the state\r\ndisintegrated - crime was able to replace it with little difficulty.\r\nThe same pattern is discernible in certain parts of the world where\r\nterrorist organizations duplicate the state and overtake it, in time.\r\nSchools, clinics, legal assistance, family support, taxation, the court\r\nsystem, transportation and telecommunication services, banking and\r\nindustry - all have a criminal doppelganger.\r\n\r\nTo secure this remarkable achievement - the underworld had to procure\r\nand then maintain - infrastructure and technologies. Indeed, criminals\r\nare great at innovating and even more formidable at making use of\r\ncutting edge technologies. There is not a single technological advance,\r\ninvention or discovery that criminals were not the first to utilize or\r\nthe first to contemplate and to grasp its full potential. There are\r\nenormous industries of services rendered to the criminal in his\r\npursuits. Accountants and lawyers, forgers and cross border guides,\r\nweapons experts and bankers, mechanics and hit-men - all stand at the\r\ndisposal of the average criminal. The choice is great and prices are\r\nalways negotiable. These auxiliary professionals are no different to\r\ntheir legitimate counterparts, despite the difference in subject\r\nmatter. A body of expertise, know-how and acumen has accumulated over\r\ncenturies of crime and is handed down the generations in the criminal\r\nuniversities known as jailhouses and penitentiaries. Roads less\r\ntravelled, countries more lenient, passports to be bought, sold, or\r\nforged, how to manuals, classified ads, goods and services on offer and\r\ndemand - all feature in this mass media cum educational (mostly verbal)\r\nbulletins. This is the real infrastructure of crime. As with more\r\nmundane occupations, human capital is what counts.\r\n\r\nCriminal activities are hugely profitable (though wealth accumulation\r\nand capital distribution are grossly non-egalitarian). Money is stashed\r\naway in banking havens and in more regular banks and financial\r\ninstitutions all over the globe. Electronic Document Interchange and\r\nelectronic commerce transformed what used to be an inconveniently slow\r\nand painfully transparent process - into a speed-of-light here-I-am,\r\nhere-I-am-gone type of operation. Money is easily movable and virtually\r\nuntraceable. Special experts take care of that: tax havens, off shore\r\nbanks, money transactions couriers with the right education and a free\r\nspirit. This money, in due time and having cooled off - is reinvested\r\nin legitimate activities. Crime is a major engine of economic growth in\r\nsome countries (where drugs are grown or traded, or in countries such\r\nas Italy, in Russia and elsewhere in CEE). In many a place, criminals\r\nare the only ones who have any liquidity at all. The other, more\r\nvisible, sectors of the economy are wallowing in the financial drought\r\nof a demonetised economy. People and governments tend to lose both\r\ntheir scruples and their sense of fine distinctions under these unhappy\r\ncircumstances. They welcome any kind of money to ensure their very\r\nsurvival. This is where crime comes in. In Central and Eastern Europe\r\nthe process was code-named: \"privatisation\".\r\n\r\nMoreover, most of the poor economies are also closed economies. They\r\nare the economies of nations xenophobic, closed to the outside world,\r\nwith currency regulations, limitations on foreign ownership,\r\nconstrained (instead of free) trade. The vast majority of the populace\r\nof these economic wretches has never been further than the neighbouring\r\ncity - let alone outside the borders of their countries. Freedom of\r\nmovement is still restricted. The only ones to have travelled freely -\r\nmostly without the required travel documents - were the criminals.\r\nCrime is international. It involves massive, intricate and\r\nsophisticated operations of export and import, knowledge of languages,\r\nextensive and frequent trips, an intimate acquaintance with world\r\nprices, the international financial system, demand and supply in\r\nvarious markets, frequent business negotiations with foreigners and so\r\non. This list would fit any modern businessman as well. Criminals are\r\ninternational businessmen. Their connections abroad coupled with their\r\nconnections with the various elites inside their country and coupled\r\nwith their financial prowess - made them the first and only true\r\nbusinessmen of the economies in transition. There simply was no one\r\nelse qualified to fulfil this role - and the criminals stepped in\r\nwillingly.\r\n\r\nThey planned and timed their moves as they always do: with shrewdness,\r\nan uncanny knowledge of human psychology and relentless cruelty. There\r\nwas no one to oppose them - and so they won the day. It will take one\r\nor more generations to get rid of them and to replace them by a more\r\ncivilized breed of entrepreneurs. But it will not happen overnight.\r\n\r\nIn the 19th century, the then expanding USA went through the same\r\nprocess. Robber barons seized economic opportunities in the Wild East\r\nand in the Wild West and really everywhere else. Morgan, Rockefeller,\r\nPullman, Vanderbilt - the most ennobled families of latter day America\r\noriginated with these rascals. But there is one important difference\r\nbetween the USA at that time and Central and Eastern Europe today. A\r\ncivic culture with civic values and an aspiration to, ultimately,\r\ncreate a civic society permeated the popular as well as the highbrow\r\nculture of America. Criminality was regarded as a shameful\r\nstepping-stone on the way to an orderly society of learned, civilized,\r\nlaw-abiding citizens. This cannot be said about Russia, for instance.\r\nThe criminal there is, if anything, admired and emulated. The language\r\nof business in countries in transition is suffused with the criminal\r\nparlance of violence. The next generation is encouraged to behave\r\nsimilarly because no clear (not to mention well embedded) alternative\r\nis propounded. There is no - and never was - a civic tradition in these\r\ncountries, a Bill of Rights, a veritable Constitution, a modicum of\r\nself rule, a true abolition of classes and nomenclatures. The future is\r\ngrim because the past was grim. Used to being governed by capricious,\r\nparanoiac, criminal tyrants - these nations know no better. The current\r\ncriminal class seems to them to be a natural continuation and extension\r\nof generations-long trends. That some criminals are members of the new\r\npolitical, financial and industrial elites (and vice versa) - surprises\r\nthem not.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Article written on August 11, 1999 and published August 23, 1999\r\n\r\nin \"Central Europe Review\" volume 1, issue 9)\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Myth of Great Albania\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\nTo the politicians of the Balkans - almost without exception corrupt\r\nand despised by their own constituencies - the myth of Great Albania\r\ncomes handy. It keeps the phobic Macedonians, the disdainful Serbs and\r\nthe poor and crime ridden Albanians united and submissive - each group\r\nfor differing reasons.\r\n\r\nTo reiterate, it is the belief that people of Albanian extract,\r\nwherever they may be, regard their domicile as part of a Great Albania\r\nand undertake all efforts necessary to secure such an outcome. Thus, to\r\nmention one example, Kosovo should be part of this Great Albania, so\r\nthe myth goes, because prior to 1912, when the Serbs occupied it,\r\nKosovo has administratively been part of an Ottoman mandated Albania.\r\nSali Berisha - a former Prime Minister of Albania - talks ominously\r\nabout an \"Albanian Federation\". The younger, allegedly more urbane\r\nPandeli Majko, the current Prime Minister of Albania, raises the idea\r\n(?) of a uniform curriculum for all Albanian pupils and students,\r\nwherever they may reside. Albanians in Macedonia make it a point to fly\r\nAlbanian flags conspicuously and of every occasion. This could have\r\nwell been a plausible scenario had it not been for two facts. First\r\nthat there is no such thing as homogeneous \"Albanians\" and second that\r\nGreat Albania is without historical precedent.\r\n\r\nAlbanians are comprised of a few ethnic groups of different creeds.\r\nThere are catholic Albanians - like Mother Theresa - and Muslim\r\nAlbanians - Like Hashim Thaci. There are Tosks - southern Albanians who\r\nspeak a (nasal) dialect of Albanian and there are Gegs - northern\r\nAlbanians (and Kosovars) who speak another dialect, which has little in\r\ncommon with Tosk (at least to my ears). Tosks don't like Gegs and Gegs\r\ndetest Tosks. In a region where tribal and village loyalties\r\npredominate these are pertinent and important facts.\r\n\r\nThe Kosovars are considered by their Albanian \"brethren\" (especially by\r\nthe Tosks, but also by Albanian Gegs) to be cold, unpleasant, filthy\r\nrich cheats. Albanians - Tosks and Gegs alike - are considered by the\r\nKosovars to be primitive, ill-mannered bandits. There is no love lost\r\nbetween all these groups. When the crisis brought on by Operation\r\nAllied Force started, the local Albanian population charged the\r\nrefugees amidst them with exorbitant (not to say extortionate) prices\r\nfor such necessities as a roof over their head, food and cigarettes.\r\nWhen the UN mandate (read: the KLA mandate) was established, the\r\nAlbanians rushed to export their brand of crime and banditry to Kosovo\r\nand to prey on its local population. No Macedonian - however radical -\r\nwill dare say about the Albanians what my Kosovar contacts say. They\r\nnonchalantly and matter of factly attribute to them the most heinous\r\ncrimes and uncivilized behaviour. Kosovars had - and are still having -\r\nan excruciating experience in Albania during this crisis. The lesson\r\n(being learned by Kosovars since Albania opened up to them in 1990)\r\nwill not be easily forgotten or forgiven. Albanians reciprocate by\r\nportraying the Kosovars as cynical, inhuman, money making terminators,\r\nemotionless wealthy predators.\r\n\r\nThis is not to say that Albanians on both sides of the border do not\r\nshare the same national dreams and aspirations. Kosovar intellectuals\r\nwere watching Albanian TV and reading Albanian papers even throughout\r\nthe Stalinist period of Enver Hoxha, the long time Albanian dictator.\r\nAlbanian nationalists never ceased regarding Kosovo as an integral part\r\nof an Albanian motherland. But as the decades passed by, as the\r\ndialects metamorphesized, as the divide grew wider, as the political\r\nsystems diverged and as the political and cultural agendas became more\r\ndistinct - Kosovars became more and more Kosovars and less and less\r\nmainland Albanians.\r\n\r\nThis historical, 80 year-old rift was exacerbated by the abyss between\r\nthe Enver Hoxha regime and its Tito counterpart. The former -\r\nimpoverished, paranoiac, xenophobic, hermetically isolated, violent.\r\nThe latter - relatively enlightened, economically sprightly, open to\r\nthe world and dynamic. As a result, Kosovar houses are three times as\r\nbig as Albanian ones and Kosovars used to be (up to the Kosovo\r\nconflict) three times richer (in terms of GDP per capita). Kosovars\r\ncrossing into Albania during the Hoxha regime were often jailed and\r\ntortured by its fearsome secret police. A Kosovar - Xhaferr Deva -\r\nserved as Minister of the Interior in the hated WW2 government in\r\nAlbania, which collaborated wholeheartedly with the Nazis. Albanians,\r\nin general, were much more reserved and suspicious towards the Germans\r\n(who occupied Albania from 1943, after the Italian change of heart).\r\nOnly Kosovars welcomed them as liberators from Serb serfdom (as did\r\nAlbanians in Macedonia to a lesser extent). This aforementioned Deva\r\nwas responsible for the most unspeakable atrocities against the\r\nAlbanian population in Albania proper. It did not render the Kosovars\r\nmore popular. In Albania proper, three anti-fascist resistance\r\nmovements - the Albanian Communist Party, Balli Kombetar (the National\r\nFront) and Legaliteti (Legality, a pro-Zug faction) fought against the\r\noccupiers since 1941. The Communists seized control of the country at\r\nthe end of 1944.\r\n\r\nThus, the forced re-union was a culture shock to both. The Kosovars\r\nwere stunned by the living conditions, misery and lawlessness of\r\nAlbania proper. The Albanians were envious and resentful of their\r\nguests and regarded them as legitimate objects for self-enrichment.\r\nThere were, needless to say, selfless exceptions to the egotistic rule.\r\nBut I cannot think of any right now.\r\n\r\nHistorically, there was never a \"Great Albania\" to hark back to.\r\nAlbania was created in 1912 (its borders finally settled in 1913) in\r\nresponse to Austro-Hungarian demands. It never encouraged Kosovo to\r\nsecede. The Albanian King Zog suppressed the activities of Kosovar\r\nirredentist movements in his country in between the two world wars.\r\nAlbania, mired in the twin crises of economy and identity - had little\r\nmind or heart for Kosovo.\r\n\r\nBut this was the culmination of a much longer, convoluted and\r\nfascinating history.\r\n\r\nFrom Illyrium to Skanderberg\r\n\r\nThere is very little dispute among serious (that is, non-Greek,\r\nnon-Macedonian and non-Serb) scholars that the Albanians are an ancient\r\npeople, the descendants of the Illyrians or (as a small minority\r\ninsists) the Thracians. The Albanian language is a rather newer\r\ndevelopment (less than 1500 years-old) - but it is also traced back\r\neither to Thracian or to Illyrian. In a region obsessed with history,\r\nreal and (especially) invented, these 4000 year-old facts are of\r\nenormous and practical import.\r\n\r\nIronically, the Illyrians were an ethnic mishmash that inhabited all of\r\nthe former Yugoslavia and parts of Greece (Epirus). There were also\r\nmajor differences between the Illyrians of the highlands (the current\r\nAlbania) - isolated and backward - and those of the lowland, the\r\nworldly and civilized. But these distinctions pale in comparison to the\r\npraise heaped on the Illyrians by their contemporaries. They were\r\nconsidered to be brave warriors and generous hosts. They mined their\r\nrich land for iron, copper, gold and silver and, despite being pagan,\r\nthey buried their dead because they believed in the afterlife and its\r\nrewards or punishments. In their liburnae - slim lined, very fast\r\ngalleys - they sailed and developed marine trade. The Romans adopted\r\nthe design of their vessels and even kept the name Liburnian.\r\n\r\nDurres and Vlore were really established by the Greeks 2500 years ago.\r\nThe former was called Epidamnus, the latter (actually, a settlement a\r\nfew kilometres away) Apollonia. It was part of a Greek colonization\r\ndrive that effected lands as far away as Asia Minor in today's Turkey.\r\nAs was the usual case, the Greeks traded their superior civilization\r\nand culture for the superior administrative and economic skills of the\r\nnatives. It was no coincidence that Illyrian political organization was\r\nconcurrent with the Greek presence. It started as defence alliances and\r\nended as kingdoms (the Enkalayes, the Taulantes, the Epirotes, the\r\nArdianes). And the enemy - even then - were the Macedonians under\r\nPhilip the Second and his son Alexander the Great.\r\n\r\nBut the Macedonian empire was short lived and was superseded by the far\r\nsuperior and self-conscious Romans. In 229, the Illyrians (commanded by\r\na woman, Queen Teuta) were almost wiped out by Roman armies advancing\r\nto the Adriatic. It was the beginning of the damaging involvement of\r\nthe superpowers in the area. Exactly 60 years later, Illyrium was no\r\nmore. Rome prevailed and ruled the land now known as Illyricum.\r\n\r\nThose were a good 600 years. Rome - as opposed to Ottoman Empire - was\r\na benign, enlightened, laissez faire type of loose assemblage of\r\ntaxpayers and tax collectors. Art and culture and philosophy and even\r\nthe Illyrian tongue and Illyrian civilization flourished. It was a\r\nrich, materially endowed period in which citizens found sufficient\r\nleisure to indulge in all manner of Eastern cults, such as Christianity\r\nor the cult of Mithra (the Persian god of light). Christianity competed\r\nhead on with the Illyrian pagan divinities and by 58 AD it was so\r\nstrong that it was able to establish its own bishopric in Dyrrhachium\r\n(formerly Apollonia). This was followed by a few Episcopal seats. It\r\nwas also followed by intolerance, bigotry, hypocrisy and persecution,\r\nas all institutional religions go. The Roman and Greek heritage of live\r\nand let live, of art, of the aesthetics of the human body, of nature -\r\nin short: Hellenism - was strangled by the ever more obscure and\r\ndogmatic brand of Christianity that pervaded Byzantium until the\r\nIconoclastic Controversy of 732. The emperor Leo III actually did the\r\nAlbanian Church a great favour by detaching it from under the authority\r\nof the Roman Pope and placing it under the more humane patriarch of\r\nConstantinople. Still, the dividing line between north and south in\r\nAlbania was as much religious as economic. The south maintained its\r\nallegiance to Constantinople while the north looked south, to Rome for\r\nspiritual guidance. When the church split in 1054 (to East and West) -\r\nthese affiliations remained intact.\r\n\r\nIt is very little known but the Illyrians actually ruled the Roman\r\nEmpire in its last decades. There were a few Illyrian emperors (Gaius\r\nDecius, Claudius Gothicus, Aurelian, Probus, Diocletian, even\r\nConstantine the Great). And most of the officers of the by now fabled\r\nthough dilapidated Roman army were Illyrians. In 395, in the\r\ncataclysmic split of the dying empire to East (later, Byzantium) and\r\nWest, Albania became finally and firmly a part of the East. The\r\nIllyrians continued to exercise great influence of the amputated East,\r\nsome of them becoming influential and historically significant emperors\r\n(Anastasius I, Justin I, Justinian I). As a result, Illyria was the\r\nfavourite target of all manner of barbarian tribes: the Visigoths, the\r\nHuns, the Ostrogoths. When the Slavs appeared on the heels of these\r\ninvasions, the Illyrians regarded them as just another barbarian tribe.\r\n\r\nThe interaction between the Illyrians and the Slavs was a love-hate\r\nrelationship and has remained so ever since. Some Illyrian groups\r\nassimilated, intermarried and assumed the culture of the invaders. In\r\n300 years, between the 6th and the 8th centuries AD, all the Illyrians\r\nin today's former Yugoslav republics vanished only to re-appear as\r\nSlavs. But the Illyrians of the south (Albania, Western Macedonia)\r\nresisted this process of dilution bitterly and preserved their identity\r\nand culture fiercely. To distinguish themselves from the \"assimilated\"\r\n- they invented Albania. The name itself is much older. Ptolemy of\r\nAlexandria mentioned it 600 years before the Illyrians began to apply\r\nit to their dwindling polity. And another 300 years were needed - well\r\ninto the 11th century AD - before the Illyrians were fully accepted\r\ntheir reinvention as Albanians - the successors to the Albanoi tribe,\r\nwhich used to occupy today's central Albania (formerly called Arberi).\r\nFive centuries later, the Albanians themselves renamed their territory\r\nand began to call it Shqiperia. No one really knows why, not even\r\nAlbanian scholars, though they like to attribute it (on flimsy\r\netymological grounds) to Shqipe, the Albanian word for Eagle. Thus,\r\nAlbania was transformed to the Land of the Eagle.\r\n\r\nIt is an irony of history that the Middle (or Dark) Ages were the best\r\nperiod ever in Albania's history. Powerful cities proliferated,\r\ninhabited by a class of burghers who engaged in trading. Albanian\r\nmerchant houses established outposts and branches all over the\r\nMediterranean, from Venice to Thessalonica. Albanians were the epitome\r\nof education and cultivated the arts. They conversed only in Greek and\r\nLatin, letting the auld language die. The Byzantine Empire was divided\r\nto military provinces (themes). One thing led to another and military\r\ncommanders transformed feudal lords administered serfdom to the\r\npopulation. Feudalism co-existed and then supplanted urbanism and the\r\nbig estates became so autonomous that they ignored the Byzantine court\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\nBut Albania was never peaceful. It was conquered by Bulgarians,\r\nNormans, Italians, Venetians and Serbs in 1347. Many Albanians\r\nimmigrated when the Serbs took over, led by Stefan Dusan. They went to\r\nGreece and the Aegean Islands. It was not until 1388 that Albania was\r\ninvaded by the Turks. By 1430 it was Turkish. By 1443 it was Albanian.\r\nTo this incredible turn of events, the Albanian had Skanderberg to\r\nthank. A military genius (real name Gjergj Kastrioti), he drove the\r\nrising superpower of the Balkans out in a series of humiliating defeats\r\nadministered by a coalition of Albanian princes. From his mountainous\r\nhideout in Kruje, he frustrated the Turkish efforts to regain Albania\r\n(they were planning to use it as staging ground for the invasion of\r\nItaly and, thereafter, Western Europe). The Italians (even the Pope,\r\nthen the long arm of various shady Italian principates) supported\r\nSkanderberg monetarily and militarily - but he did by far the lion's\r\nshare of the work.\r\n\r\nBut it was a personality-dependent achievement. Like all great leaders,\r\nSkanderberg's fault is that he refused to admit his own mortality and\r\nto nurture the right successor. Following his death, the Turks\r\nrecaptured Albania in 1506. But Skanderberg's heroic fight had two\r\nimportant consequences. One outcome was a considerable weakening of the\r\nTurkish drive towards the heart of Europe and its West. They will never\r\nregain the momentum again and the war was lost. The second momentous\r\nconsequence was that his struggle moulded an Albanian NATION where\r\nthere was none before.\r\n\r\nFrom the Ottomans to the Americans\r\n\r\nThe Ottoman occupation was an unmitigated misfortune. Albania -\r\nculturally, a veritable part of Italy in the past - was cut off from it\r\nand from the Renaissance it spawned. The Turks brought with them their\r\nvenal type of devastation, not only economic, not only physical, not\r\nonly in human lives - but also cultural. A gangrenous paralysis ensued.\r\nThe lucky quarter of the population escaped to Italy. The others were\r\nleft to fight it out through civil disobedience (refusal to pay taxes,\r\nto serve in the army, to surrender their weapons) and in open\r\nrebellion, time and again, indefatigably and resourcefully, often in\r\nthe name of the Christian faith. To put an end to the nuisance, the\r\nTurks islamised the lot (at any rate, two thirds of the lot) during the\r\n16th and 17th centuries. To ensure conversion, the Turks tortured,\r\nkilled, raped and taxed the Christians. It worked and people crossed to\r\nthe other side in droves. Now there were Catholic Albanians and Muslim\r\nAlbanians. It was a replay of the old, 11th century, religious\r\nfragmentation. Albanian political leaders in the 19th century - aware\r\nof the potential of these fractures to denationalise - insisted on\r\n\"Albanianism\" - a substitute, unifying political \"religion\". The\r\nrallying cry was: \"The religion of Albanians is Albanianism.\"\r\n\r\nNothing much changed in Albania since the time of feudalism. The Turks\r\nawarded local warlords with land estates to administer (timars). These\r\nwarlords - the centres of real power both political and military -\r\nsubverted the authority and dominion of the empire. The more the latter\r\ntried to appease them with endowments - the more potent and ambitious\r\nthey became. The Bushati family, the eccentric Ali Pasa Tepelene (who\r\nalso ruled Northern Greece) and others. In convulsive feats of\r\nreassertion of authority, some sultans deposed of these pashas - but\r\nthis did not anything to diminish the autonomy of their estates. In\r\n1831, Turkey abolished the timar system altogether. This bold reform\r\nbackfired as the old estates fragmented even further and power devolved\r\nto even lower levels of communal organizations run by beys (in the\r\nnorth) and bajraktars (everywhere) - bloodthirsty, rigidly patriarchal\r\nand primitive mini rulers. Paradoxically, Albanians who emigrated\r\n(mainly to Turkey itself) rose to prominence. Turkey had 27 (!) grand\r\nviziers (=prime ministers) of Albanian extract.\r\n\r\nIt was in Kosovo that discontent, unrest and revolt coagulated into the\r\nLeague of Prizren in 1878. Originally, a narrow local interest northern\r\ngroup, it fast adopted an expansive agenda, seeking to unify the four\r\nparts of Albania in the four vilayets (Kosovo, Shkoder, Monastir,\r\nJanina) into one political unit. But it wrong to attribute to it the\r\nbirth of the delirium of a Great Albania. The League sought an\r\nadministrative solution - not a political one. All they wanted was to\r\ncreate an Albanian zone - but WITHIN the Ottoman Empire. They were more\r\nfocussed on benign, less threatening things like culture, art,\r\nliterature and education. In short, it was a cultural movement with\r\nadministrative aspirations - not the beast of untethered expansionism\r\nit was made out to be by latter day (and rather interested) historians.\r\nIt was in Monastir (today's Bitola in Macedonia) that a national,\r\nLatin, alphabet was adopted in 1908. More convenient than Greek or\r\nArabic - used until then - it triumphed.\r\n\r\nHistory moves in quirkily agonizing twists and turns. It was the\r\nLeague's involvement with the Albanian language and the strong\r\nopposition by the Turks to its use (the League's activities in this\r\nrespect were banned in 1881) that transformed the League from a rather\r\nlocal affair to a modern national movement along the Italian or German\r\nlines. The Albanian language was indeed suffused by nationalism,\r\nimmersed in dreams and aspirations unfulfilled. Its reawakening\r\nsignalled the reawakening of Albanianism. When the last great hope,\r\nsealed by Young Turk (broken) promises of autonomy and democracy, was\r\nlost - the Albanians rebelled and forced the Sick Man of Europe to\r\nswallow yet another dose of medicine. In 1912 Turkey granted the\r\nAlbanians their wishes only to face the Greek, Serb and Montenegrin\r\narmies, which conquered Albania and divided it among them.\r\n\r\nThis trauma of division is a recurring trauma in the Albanian psyche.\r\nHow ironic that the only people who can empathize with them are the\r\nMacedonians who share the same fear of being quartered. Faced with the\r\nannihilation of Albania so soon after its birth, Albanian leaders met\r\nin Vlore, led by Ismail Kemal, a former high-ranking Ottoman official\r\nof Albanian origin. With nothing much to lose, they decelerated\r\nindependence (the Vlore Proclamation) on November 28, 1912.\r\n\r\nIn December 1912, the Great Powers (the forerunners of NATO) - Britain,\r\nGermany, Russia, Austro-Hungary, Italy and France - met in London to\r\ndivide the unexpected spoils. The conference handed an independent\r\nAlbanian state to Austro-Hungary and Italy. But the price was a great\r\ndiminishment in its geographical scope. Kosovo was given to Serbia,\r\nCameria to Greece, the most luscious and productive lands and more than\r\nhalf of all Albanians were left out of the new independent homeland.\r\nSuch was the nature of territorial comprises at that time that it\r\ncreated more problems than it solved. Two news ones were born that day\r\nand hour: a Yugoslav-Albanian flaring animosity and a Greek-Albanian\r\nmutual denial. The unfortunate and tragicomic German who was appointed\r\nto administer Albania (Wilhelm zu Wied) departed soon thereafter with\r\nthe outbreak of the First World War.\r\n\r\nThis first European bloodbath provoked all of Albania's neighbours into\r\nan uncontrolled binge of invasions. Austro-Hungary, France, Italy,\r\nGreece, Montenegro, Serbia - they all marched in with no plan in mind\r\nbut to occupy and plunder. The country turned chaotic and it took a\r\nWoodrow Wilson in the Paris Peace Conference to avert an abolition of\r\nthe Albanian independent state. It was not the first time Albania\r\ndescended into chaos - nor was this to be the last time the Americans\r\nwould come to the help of the Albanians. Britain, France and Italy\r\nplanned to partition it, Wilson vetoed it and that was the end of the\r\nplan and the beginning of Albania.\r\n\r\nIn Lushnje, in 1920, the Albanians convened a national congress and\r\nestablished a government. That year, Albania was admitted to the League\r\nof Nation, sponsored by the very Britain that sought its partition only\r\nthe year before. Secure in its sovereignty and international\r\nrecognition, Albania inverted its attention. Society was polarized\r\nbetween land-owning fat cats, the beys and militant archconservative\r\nbajraktars led by Ahmed Bey Zogu from Mat in the north. These\r\nreactionaries were opposed by an uncomfortable coalition of merchants,\r\nintellectuals, progressive politicians and assorted democrats led by an\r\nimprobable American-educated bishop of the Orthodox(!) church, one Fan\r\nS. Noli, middle initial and all. The conflict ended 4 years later when,\r\nin 1924 Zogu fled to Yugoslavia. But the entrenched power of the land\r\ngentry was not to be discounted so easily. Noli, now a prime minister,\r\nruled over the Albanian equivalent of the Republic of Weimar. Radical\r\nland reform, modernization, westernisation. But he was personally\r\nunstable, he won no international recognition (he was considered a\r\nrevolutionary leftist) and he had no money to buy his way with. Zogu\r\ncame back, this time with a Yugoslav-backed army. He won.\r\n\r\nFrom King Zog to a Brave, New World\r\n\r\nZog commenced his 14 years long reign first as president and then as\r\nking (Zog the first, needless to add). He ruled over a time bomb. The\r\nforces he suppressed with his foreign backed army were rather alive and\r\nwell, though in an underground sort of way. In dire need of funds,\r\nafter the self-inflicted destruction of his country, Zog resorted to\r\nmortgaging it to foreign powers such as Italy. Italy collected on its\r\nloans in 1939, when it invaded Albania on the way to its Balkan\r\ntreasure hunt. King Zog rule of beys and bajraktars aided by a ruthless\r\npolice, a Byzantine bureaucracy (a major employer) and Italian money\r\ndid stabilize the country, including to the bandit and brigand-ridden\r\nhighlands. Many schools were established during his reign. He even\r\nturned a blind eye to western fashions. But this stability was brittle\r\nand fake. Underneath the ornamental surface, the populace was seething.\r\nPeasants aggrieved by the absence of land reform. Democrats opposed to\r\na dictatorship, however benign. Liberals opposed to the police state.\r\nNationalists opposed to the undue influence of foreign powers. Albania\r\nimported grain to feed its impoverished population - and exported\r\npeople in search of a better life. Periodic revolts interspersed with\r\nlabour unrest led directly to the formation of the communist party, the\r\nstandard bearer of the educated classes.\r\n\r\nIn October 1940, Italy invaded Greece from Albania only to be folded\r\nback to whence they came. Nazi Germany had to complete the job as it\r\nswept through Yugoslavia and Greece. In 1941, Albania was rewarded for\r\nits collaboration with the annexation of Kosovo from Yugoslavia and\r\nCameria from Greece. Having been nearly eliminated by the Allies\r\n(Britain and France) at least twice - and having been rewarded by the\r\nAxis (Austro-Hungary, Germany and Italy) numerous times throughout\r\ntheir history, the Albanian's loyalty was not in doubt. Though never\r\nthe great ideologues - they were althesame instrumental in facilitating\r\nthe wartime hegemony of Germany and Italy over the Balkans. The\r\nresistance movement was not uniform, nor was it very effective (though\r\nAlbanians like to portray it differently). Finally, in 1944, the\r\ncommunists took over and their secretary general, Enver Hoxha, became\r\nthe leader of a new People's Republic of Albania, later adding the word\r\n\"Socialist\" to its name (1976).\r\n\r\nNothing seems to have changed in Albania from the 14th century to the\r\nHoxha days. Burdened by the malaise it contracted from the Ottoman\r\nEmpire, it was plagued by poverty, banditry, illiteracy, blood feuds,\r\ndisease and the slavery of women and of peasants. At first, the\r\ncommunist tried to tackle all these ills simultaneously. They drafted a\r\ngrand plan of modernization. They vowed to liberate Albania\r\neconomically and socially, now that it has been liberated politically\r\n(their reference point was, strangely enough, the bourgeoisie war of\r\n1912). Peasants were handed tiny plots of land taken from the broken\r\nestates of the former beys in an ambitious agrarian reform. Industry,\r\nbanks and all foreign property were nationalized. Agriculture was\r\ncollectivised in the best Stalinist traditions, though far less swiftly\r\n(it was completed only in 1967). Hoxha subjugated the wild highlands\r\nand strove to eliminate blood feuds and other feudal habits, taking on\r\nthe hitherto invincible bajraktars in the process. Women were granted\r\nlegal equality with men and were encouraged to participate actively in\r\ntheir society.\r\n\r\nAlbania was promiscuous in its foreign affairs, changing partners often\r\nand seemingly whimsically. It paired with Yugoslavia under Tito until\r\n1948, then with the Soviet Union during the days of Stalin and\r\nKhrushchev (until 1961) and then with Maoist China (until 1978). It\r\nexpected to receive monetary and military aid - and it did. It received\r\nenormous infusions of credits relative to its economy and it was\r\nvirtually invaded by regiments of technical experts who provided\r\nassistance with the various aspects of running a modern state.\r\nGradually, agriculture was mechanized, industry was modernized and\r\nstandards of living increased. It was a golden age and many were happy.\r\n\r\nBut Hoxha was unhappy. He accused each ally of Albania in its turn of\r\nbetraying unadulterated Marxism-Leninism in favour of the wiles of the\r\ncapitalistic West. His allies were as disenchanted with his growing\r\nparanoia and geopolitical sado-masochism. Isolated, paranoiac,\r\nobsessive and phobic - Hoxha promulgated an ideology of\r\nself-sufficiency, go-it-alone and the world-is-against-us. Thus, while\r\nAlbania made impressive leaps of technology in draining swamps, while\r\nit unified its dialects into a uniform literary language, while it\r\nindustrialized and mechanized and reformed and transformed - and it has\r\n- it did so in splendid isolation, often re-inventing the wheel. And it\r\nhad a nightmare called Sigurimi.\r\n\r\nThe Sigurimi was the shadowy, quasi-criminal state security apparatus.\r\nIt was a snake raised in the warm bosom of the party. It was\r\nomnipotent. Real or imaginary rivals of the party (really of Hoxha)\r\nwere publicly humiliated, dismissed from job, imprisoned in a system of\r\nhideous Gulags, or summarily executed. These bulimic purges were\r\ncoupled with growing schizoid tendencies. Travel abroad was prohibited\r\nexcept on official business, religion (a backward, unprogressive,\r\ndisuniting force) was banned.\r\n\r\nWhen Hoxha died in 1985, he was succeeded by a crony, Ramiz Alia, an\r\nAlbanian Gorbachev who introduced local versions of Perestroika and\r\nGlasnost even before the Soviet leader did. He legalized foreign\r\ninvestments and established diplomatic relations with the hitherto\r\nreviled West. But, despite his courage and relative openness, he shared\r\nthe fate of other reformers, falling victim to the very forces he\r\nunleashed. In 1989, the workers, the intellectuals and the Albanian\r\nyouth were all against the regime. In a spasmodic act of\r\nself-preservation, Alia granted Albanian citizens the right to travel\r\nabroad, limited the reach and powers of the Sigurimi, restored\r\nreligious freedom, freedom of political association and adopted free\r\nmarket reforms. Nothing much was left of Hoxha's heritage. Several\r\ngovernments later, the Democratic Party, an anti-communist hodgepodge\r\nalliance of interests won the elections (1992). Berisha succeeded Alia.\r\nThe communist rule was no more.\r\n\r\nIt was the beginning of a new Albania. Facing west, it hoped, as it\r\nalways has, to modernize, to reform, to belong.\r\n\r\nBut it was not meant to be.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Article published October 18-29 - November 1-8\r\n\r\nin \"Central Europe Review\" volume 1, issues 17-20)\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bad Blood of Kosovo\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe old Montenegrins, tall as their mountains, their rocky faces\r\nravaged by an unforgiving weather define \"osveta\" thus:\r\n\r\n\"Osveta, that means... a kind of spiritual fulfilment.

I t was our\r\npride before others; our blood was not water that anyone could spill.\r\nIt was, moreover, our pastures and springs - more beautiful than anyone\r\nelse's - our family feasts and births. It was the glow in our eyes, the\r\nflame in our cheeks, the pounding in our temples, the word that turned\r\nto stone in our throats on our hearing that our blood had been shed. It\r\nwas the sacred task transmitted in the hour of death to those who had\r\njust been conceived in our blood. It was centuries of manly pride and\r\nheroism, survival, a mother's milk and a sister's vow, bereaved parents\r\nand children in black, joy and songs turned into silence and wailing.\r\nIt was all, all.\"\r\n\r\nAnd this is what Margaret Durham had to say in her celebrated\r\nethnography of Albania, a long time ago (\"Some Tribal Origins of Laws\r\nand Customs of the Balkans\" - Allan and Unwin, 1928):\r\n\r\n\"A certain family had long been notorious for evil-doing - robbing,\r\nshooting, and being a pest to the tribe. A gathering of all the heads\r\ncondemned all the males of the family to death. Men were appointed to\r\nlay in wait for them on a certain day and pick them off; and on that\r\nday the whole seventeen of them were shot. One was but five and another\r\nbut twelve years old. I protested against thus killing children who\r\nmust be innocent and was told: 'It was bad blood and must not be\r\nfurther propagated.' Such was the belief in heredity that it was\r\nproposed to kill an unfortunate woman who was pregnant, lest she should\r\nbear a male and so renew the evil.\"\r\n\r\nIn the second century BC, Kosovo was populated by people with\r\npicturesque names: the Iliyrians, Thracians, the Celts. The whole area\r\nwas under Roman rule and was subjected to the industriousness and\r\nmeticulousness of Empire. Roads were paved, cities built, populations\r\nmoved and commerce flourished. This lasted two hundreds years. Slav\r\ntribes descended from the Carpathian Mountains and ended it in orgies\r\nof blood and fire. Until this very day, serious Greek politicians\r\ninvoke this primordial invasion in their effort to convince an\r\nincredulous world that the (current) Macedonians are not the (True)\r\nMacedonians. \"They are the off spring of invading Slavs\" - they claim,\r\npassionately, as is the habit in the Balkans. It took another two\r\ncenturies and a Byzantine brief occupation to force the reluctant Slavs\r\nto settle along the Sava River and to form the poor semblance of a\r\ncivilization in the making. Roving \"saints\" of fervent disposition\r\ntaught them a new alphabet. Cyril and Methodius were succeeded by\r\ndisciples all over Central and Eastern Europe - from the period of\r\nKliment Ohridski in today's territories of Macedonia and Bulgaria to\r\nAmos Comenius, the 17th century educator, considered in the Balkans to\r\nbe their spiritual descendant in the Czech Lands.\r\n\r\nThis ability to cast their myths in paper in the vernacular, to hand\r\nthe national memory down the generations, the newfound Christian\r\nreligion - all coagulated into an emergently distinct culture. Come the\r\n12th century, Kosovo was entirely Slav.\r\n\r\nOr, to be more precise: entirely Serb. The Slavs fractured into three\r\ngroups. The Croats and Slovenes, baptized by Rome, became ardent Roman\r\nCatholics. The Serbs - introduced to the faith by Byzantium - remained\r\nEastern Orthodox. This division was to last a thousand years as the\r\nCroats and the Slovenes came under the influence and rule of the\r\nCatholic Habsburgs while the Serbs were subjected to the crumbling\r\nOttoman chaos. Geography mirrored a tormented topography of\r\nmentalities, religious persuasions and political affiliations. The\r\nSerbs occupied today's Serbia, Montenegro and Bosnia Herzegovina. The\r\nCroats and Slovenes occupied the rest of latter day Yugoslavia. The\r\nTito generated unity of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was but a brief and\r\nfalse note. It could not have lasted - and, indeed, it hasn't.\r\n\r\nThe Serbs established a principality in Kosovo - the nucleus of what\r\nlater came to be known as the Serbian Golden Age. It was situated in\r\nthe rustic but magnificent valley of Ibar and controlled most of the\r\nSandzak. Gradually, the whole of hitherto empty Kosovo became theirs\r\nand they felt sufficiently at home to form a Serbian Orthodox Church\r\nwith its seat in Raska, just north of Kosovo. It took 19 years\r\n(1200-1219) to complete this feat of independence and all this time\r\nKosovo was fought over by Serbs, Bulgarians, Hungarians, Romans and\r\nByzantines. Hundreds of years of strife, veiled conspiracies, invasions\r\nand rotting corpses in sun drenched battlefields.\r\n\r\nTo the Serbs it was a Golden Age. Under the Nemanje dynasty, luck\r\nstruck thrice in the figures of kings Stephen (1169-89), Milutin\r\n(1281-1321) and Dusan (1331-55). Workers were brought in from\r\nTransylvania to mine the wealth of the land. Ever more prosperous,\r\nKosovo became the throbbing heart of Serbland. The splendid royal\r\ncourt, ravishing in gold and red, radiated power north of Kosovo and\r\nunto today's Slovenia, up to the Adriatic Sea, making Pec the new seat\r\nof the Serbian Orthodox church. When Dusan died, history held its\r\nbreath, the nation poised precariously on a precipice of internecine\r\nconflict. But the stability was fake. The question of inheritance,\r\ntranslated into the currency of power plays, tore the land apart. The\r\nTurks were there to pick up the pieces in the masochistically\r\ncelebrated battle of Kosovo Polje in June 28th 1389. But not for\r\nanother 70 years did they exert real control over this newly gained\r\nterritory - so powerful and ferocious were their Serb adversaries even\r\nin their decline. Besieged by Mongols from the east, the Turks, already\r\nthe sick man, retreated and left the Serbs to their own\r\nself-destructive devices.\r\n\r\nAll this time, there are no Albanians in the historiography of this\r\ncursed land. It is, therefore, almost startling to find them there,\r\nsufficiently armed and organized t oppose the... Turks!\r\n\r\nHaving dealt the Mongols some mortal blows, the Turkish beast shifted\r\nits attention to another bruise in its by now writhing body, to Kosovo.\r\nThe Turkish armies conquered Prizren, driving before them the\r\ndilapidated and depleted Serb forces. It was an Albanian king,\r\nSkanderberg, who rebelled against them there. Albanians then were\r\nCatholics (as many of them are to this very day), their war against\r\ntheir future allies, a holy war. This was in 1459 and only 250 years\r\nlater did the Turks embark upon a policy of actively encouraging the\r\n(by now Muslim) Albanians to emigrate to Kosovo - not before the Serbs\r\nwere expelled following an unsuccessful rebellion in 1690.\r\n\r\nThis Turkish propensity was nothing extraordinary. Empires throughout\r\nhistory settled \"loyal\" populations where they displaced restive ones.\r\nBut in Kosovo a confluence of fault lines led to especially bitter\r\nsediments, which went on to poison the waters of co-existence for\r\ncenturies to come. Converted Moslem Albanians versus Christian Serbs;\r\nAlbanian collaborators and traitors (as perceived by the Serbs) versus\r\nSerb mythical heroes (again as perceived by the Serbs); a nation of the\r\nascendance versus a nation dispersed and the last European defence line\r\nagainst Islam traitorously compromised by fellow Christians and\r\nChristian kingdoms. Serbs fleeing from Kosovo, from Serbia itself, from\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonia - moved due north, to refugee\r\ncamps set up by the Habsburg empire. Serbs settled in Vojvodina and\r\nKrajina, thus sowing the seeds of 20th century conflicts with Croatia\r\nand Hungary. And all this time they carried with them a baggage of\r\nhatred and revenge, a lethal, bloodied promise to be back and to exact\r\nthe price of betrayal from the Albanians. In 1737 they established a\r\nSerbian homeland in Vojvodina. In 1738 they rebelled, again to be\r\ndefeated in the scene of their national trauma, in Kosovo Polje.\r\nAnother wave of immigrants followed and another wave of Albanians took\r\nover their abandoned property in Metohia. The Turks abolished the seat\r\nof the Serb church in Pec in 1766. It seemed that the Serb nation has\r\nbeen all but eradicated.\r\n\r\nBut this was not to be. In one of the more magnificent sleights of hand\r\nthat history is so famous for - the Russians forced the beaten Ottoman\r\nEmpire to grant the Serbs autonomy. It was nothing like the hallowed\r\npast sovereignty and glory of the Dusan court but it was a step that\r\nrekindled nationalistic sentiments in the most humble and humbled Serb\r\nthroughout the land. This flame has since never been extinguished and\r\nit is at the blazing heart of the Milosevic Yugoslav Wars of\r\nInheritance. That - and the belief that history is cyclical and that\r\nthere is always hope.\r\n\r\nKosovo was by now entirely \"Alabanized\". Pristina was the hub of\r\ntransport and the seat of the administration. Names of places, which\r\nresounded both in the 14th century and at the close of the 20th, recur.\r\nIn Prizren in 1878 the Albanians established their first national\r\nmovement. There they came of age. The infancy of Serbhood and the\r\nadulthood of Albanianism clashed in the same region, the prelude to the\r\ntragedy of 1999.\r\n\r\nUnder the Treaty of Berlin in 1878, Serbia became de jure an\r\nindependent country. Its anguished delegation, eager and paranoid, gave\r\nup Kosovo in dealings behind the gilded scenes. It was a tactical move,\r\nwhich the Serbs reversed in the First Balkan War (1912) - when they\r\nregained Kosovo - and in the Second Balkan War (1913) when they\r\nregained Macedonia. In these bloody rehearsals of the World Wars, the\r\nSerbs succeeded to redefine the borders - but also to give birth to\r\nAlbania. It is an irony of history that Serb bellicosity and\r\nnationalistic dreams gave rise to the modern Albanian state. But then\r\nthis IS the nature of the Balkans - a hazy nightmare in which enemies\r\ngive birth to one another. An intricate commerce of Christian death and\r\nresurrection, the gifts of death and life exchanged among Gregorian\r\nchants and the prayer cries of Muezzins. In 1926 the Serbs and the\r\nAlbanians drew the borderline between their sovereign states. It was a\r\nbad invention, this line of demarcation. It separated close to 600,000\r\nAlbanians in Kosovo and Macedonia from Albania proper. The disgruntled\r\npopulace did not engage in acts of terror or in gestures of\r\nnationalistic indignation. Instead, they emigrated to Albania and to\r\nTurkey - tens of thousands of Albanians, perhaps as many as three\r\nhundred thousand, or half the population. And the Serbs came in their\r\nstead. The wheel has been reversed, or so it seemed.\r\n\r\nNothing in the Balkans is what it seems to be. Every surface is teeming\r\nunderneath with hidden meanings, obscure interpretations and exegetic\r\nexcesses. They who are up go down, bringing in their wake, through the\r\nsheer force of their own fall - the rise of their adversaries. Delicate\r\nlaws of conservation preserve all grudges balanced, all the accounts\r\nsettled and all agony equally distributed. It is an entropy of history\r\nitself, slowly decaying into chaotic repetition.\r\n\r\nAnd thus when Italy conquered Kosovo (it, with Ethiopia being the only\r\nthing it ever conquered) - it gave it to Albania. Germany, which\r\ndominated Yugoslavia, consented. For a brief four years, the Albanian\r\nnation was completely united, territorially, at least.\r\n\r\nBut this did not last long. After the war, Yugoslavia re-acquired\r\nKosovo and the communist regime embarked on a Turkish-like brutal\r\nsuppression of the Albanian population. For twenty-one years, secret\r\nunits of the police hunted, executed and mutilated free spirited\r\nAlbanians all over Kosovo. In more ways than one, Albanians were the\r\nfirst true dissidents in the entire communist bloc. How ironic, if one\r\nrecalls the Albanian Enver Hoxa, the leader of next-door Albania and\r\nthe fiercest of all communist leaders. In 1968 Albanian students joined\r\ntheir colleagues the world over and demonstrated against Serb\r\nrepression. These particular outbursts were easily squashed but in 1974\r\nKosovo was made an autonomous province of Yugoslavia by constitutional\r\nreforms. School instruction in Albanian was legalized. During all this\r\nperiod, Serbs - especially battle hardened war veterans - were\r\neconomically encouraged to migrate to Kosovo. Albanians were encouraged\r\nto go the other way and many did. About 200,000 Albanians left between\r\nthe years 1954-7 alone!!!\r\n\r\nBy now, these human waves and military trampling left Kosovo\r\ndilapidated to the core, a backwater both economically and culturally.\r\nPeople left Kosovo in this period because it offered no present work\r\nand no future prospects. One hundred thousand Serbs left between\r\n1961-87. Much later many would claim that they were harassed by the\r\nAlbanian majority but this sounds fake, a re-writing of history.\r\nAlbanians left as well. Everyone who had a choice chose to leave\r\nimpoverished Kosovo.\r\n\r\nThen Tito died and nothing was the same. The 1981 riots in Kosovo led\r\nto the imposition of martial law. As students from Pristina University\r\nrampaged in the streets, the government sealed Kosovo off, sent in the\r\nmilitia to restore order (which it did with vehement cruelty and\r\nbestiality) and closed down educational institutions. Pristina\r\nUniversity was always a hotbed of nationalism - witness its\r\nMaoist-Marxist graduate, the head of the KLA and the self-appointed\r\nPrime Minister of Kosovo, Hashim Thaci. But that particular spring was\r\nexceptional. Public disorder was coupled with grave acts of economic\r\nsabotage. The students demanded an end to discrimination and certain\r\nfreedoms but really they demanded jobs commensurate with their\r\ntraining, jobs, which they believed went to the Serbs.\r\n\r\nFive years later, a hitherto obscure communist leader (he was just\r\nelected Serbia's party secretary) visited Kosovo. In a chance encounter\r\nwith angry Serb mobs in the streets of Pristina he accused the\r\nAlbanians of genocide. \"No one should do this to you\" - he said, grim\r\nfaced, visibly shaken, cunningly calculating.\r\n\r\nHis name was Milosevic.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Article published August 16, 1999 in \"Central Europe Review\"\r\n\r\nvolume 1, issue 8)\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Plight of the Kosovar\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRumour has it that from now on, citizens of the Former Yugoslav\r\nRepublic of Macedonia will need a hard-to-obtain visa to enter the\r\nCzech Republic. This already is the case with Bosnians, for instance.\r\nOfficials in Macedonia believe that this is intended to stem a flow of\r\nfuture Kosovar immigrants. If so, the Czech government holds a grim\r\nview of the prospects of peace there and rightly so. Discounting the\r\nSecond World War and numerous other skirmishes, the developing war in\r\nKosovo is the Fourth Balkan War. The Czech Republic already hosts a\r\ngreat number of \"Former Yugoslavs\" and of Albanians, for measure.\r\nOrdinary Czechs believe them to be responsible - together with Russians\r\nand Ukrainians - to the uncontrollable and intimidating wave of street\r\ncrime. This intuition, it seems, is based less on statistics than on\r\nplain old xenophobia.\r\n\r\nThe situation is shrouded in myths and misconceptions. The Albanians in\r\nAlbania are not related to the Albanians in Macedonia (known as\r\n\"Shiptars\"). The former are mostly Christians - the latter Moslems\r\n(like their brethren in Kosovo). Even the Albanians in Albania are not\r\na cohesive lot - they are divided to Northerners and Southerners with\r\nbitter mutual enmity the only thing connecting them. Witness the recent\r\nnear disintegration of the Albanian state over regional politics\r\n(disguised as a financial scandal). The risk of a spillover of the\r\nconflict into Albanian territory is small. Not so with Macedonia. This\r\nis why NATO is flexing its muscles on Macedonian territory. The message\r\nis ostensibly intended for Yugoslav ears. Really, NATO hopes that it\r\nwill echo far north, in the Kremlin. The Balkans is a strategic area -\r\nsays NATO - and we will bomb to pieces anyone who wishes to meddle in\r\nit. Cold war rhetoric and not from Russian lips, this time.\r\n\r\nThe Slav Macedonians loathe and fear the Albanians. The latter do not\r\nhide their desire to tear Macedonia apart and establish a Greater\r\nAlbania, comprising Macedonia's Western parts. Radical new leaders -\r\nsuch as the now imprisoned Rufi Osmani, mayor of Gostivar - hoisted\r\nAlbanian flags on municipal buildings. This led to bloody riots. Slav\r\nstudents counter-rioted when Albanians demanded bilingual education.\r\nThings are explosive even without Kosovo.\r\n\r\nBut this is part of a larger picture. The Macedonian political elite\r\nnever really wanted to separate itself from the Yugoslav Federation. In\r\nthe first years of the embargo on Yugoslavia, Macedonia was the main\r\nroute of smuggling into the beleaguered country (from Greece, through\r\nthe Vardar river). Macedonia is torn between supporting Serbia and the\r\nSlav cause (championed by Russia) - and complying with Western\r\npressures. The West finances the gigantic trade and current account\r\ndeficits of Macedonia, without which the economy and the currency would\r\nhave long crashed even beyond their incredibly depressed levels. Other\r\nfactions still dream about a Greater Bulgaria. The opposition,\r\nIMRO-DPMNE is accused of being the creation of the Bulgarian secret\r\nservice, or the Bulgarian mob, depending on the speaker. Persistent\r\nrumours have it that Milosevic signed a secret pact with the Macedonian\r\nruling (former socialist) party, the SDSM, using the mediation of\r\nArkan, a particularly ferocious militia commander in the good old days.\r\nSerbia undertook to heat the border with Macedonia just before the\r\nOctober elections and thus to allow the government either to postpone\r\nthem or to declare a state of emergency. The SDSM stands to lose big in\r\nthe elections following economic mismanagement and colossal corruption\r\ncharges. The main beneficiary is a repatriated politician (whose vote,\r\nby the way, was crucial in dismantling the Yugoslav Federation), Vasil\r\nTupurkovski. He is perceived as \"Mr. Clean Hands\", though backed, from\r\nthe shadows, by Big Business. He is also pro-American (he lived in the\r\nStates many years and his family is still there). Russian hands don't\r\nlike this, probably.\r\n\r\nGradually, anti-Western feelings are emerging in Macedonia. The USA is\r\nperceived as automatically anti-Serbian (read: anti-Slav) and\r\npro-Albanian. Emotions run high against Germany and the United Kingdom,\r\nas well. Russia benefits from all this. If it plays its cards wisely,\r\nit could achieve two goals: (a) Destabilize the Southern flank of NATO\r\nand (b) transform Macedonia into its agent. If the conflict escalates,\r\nGreece and Turkey could be easily drawn in. Both are NATO members. They\r\nwill not be fighting on the same side, though. And maybe they will\r\ncarry the fighting into Cyprus. Though far fetched, this is the first\r\nopportunity in a decade to seriously dent the NATO facade. Russia is\r\nnot likely to miss it. Milosevic, in many respects, is a pain. In other\r\nrespects, though, he is a strategic gift from heaven.\r\n\r\nThe Kosovo situation is a blessing, not in disguise, for Macedonia. It\r\nis through this - and other Serb-induced crises - that Macedonia\r\nattained geopolitical importance. The West pampers Macedonia and\r\nfinances its fiscal and trade excesses precisely because of its\r\nstrategic location and because of its Albanians. The potential for\r\ninter-ethnic tension is deemed to be sizeable by the West. To avert it,\r\nthe West is willing to bribe all parties involved into tense calm and\r\nstrained civility.\r\n\r\nThe Kosovo crisis has just started. The Serbs are a resilient, cunning\r\nbunch. Their withdrawal following the US-mediated accord is tactical,\r\nnot strategic. They will be back. They will do their best to present\r\nthe Albanians as intransigent, irrational and belligerent during the\r\nprocess of negotiating autonomy for the province. This will not be\r\ndifficult. The recent crisis radicalised even the moderate Albanians\r\n(like Rugova). Their demands ARE likely to be zany and unacceptable.\r\nThis will be Milosevic's chance to convert the West to his side. He\r\nwill act the peacemaker, the moderate, the conciliator - and let the\r\nAlbanians do the dirty work of threats, walkouts and occasional terror.\r\n\r\nThere will be war in Kosovo. It is only a matter of time and nerves.\r\nMilosevic has plenty of both - the Albanians and their Western\r\nsupporters none. The incident has escalated into a mini cold war.\r\nRussia has mobilized select units of its army and moved its anti\r\naircraft missiles to counter a possible NATO strike. The new rulers of\r\nthe Kremlin are old cold war hands and habits die hard in Russia.\r\nKosovo is a golden opportunity to destabilize NATO (by provoking Turkey\r\nagainst Greece, for instance). I have expounded upon this elsewhere.\r\n\r\nOnce a real war breaks, the Albanians in Macedonia will be tempted to\r\njoin in the fray. Though ethnically different - they are not\r\nnationalistically indifferent. Hitherto, KLA has failed to establish a\r\npresence on Macedonian soil and inter-ethnic clashes have been\r\nsurprisingly limited and subdued. Still, the potential is there. The\r\nAlbanians in Macedonia are concentrated in a well-defined geographical\r\ntriangle. They could demand the same autonomy that their northern\r\nbrothers are trying to extract from Milosevic. Moreover, they are\r\nbetter integrated into the political and economic life in Macedonia.\r\nFollowing the next elections (18/10) they are likely to hold the\r\nbalance of power. And they are getting more and more adept at using it.\r\nThey feel like second class Macedonians. They would like to become\r\nfirst class Albanians. So, there will be clashes and tension in\r\nMacedonia over Albanian demands for greater autonomy.\r\n\r\nThen there is the Serb-Macedonian tortured relationship. As I said,\r\nMacedonia was the last to (reluctantly) secede from the Yugoslav\r\nFederation. It escaped harm by aiding and abetting the Serbs during the\r\nsiege. Macedonia was a vital (also corrupt and lucrative) bloodline,\r\nconnecting Greece to Serbia (through the Vardar river). Politicians and\r\nbusinessmen (in Macedonia, these are linked vocations) made fortunes.\r\nSmugglers and other criminal elements flooded the country, never to go\r\nback. The two regimes are not friends but they maintain the\r\nHillary-Bill marriage: power sharing, convenience, the occasional\r\nextramarital fling. Serbia will not attack Macedonia as long as it\r\nmaintains express neutrality. NATO will not compromise this neutrality\r\nbecause it does not want additional trouble in its hinterland if it\r\ninvades Serbia. As long as this (admittedly shaky) tacit understanding\r\nprevails - there is no \"Serbian risk\".\r\n\r\nTo sum up: I do not see Macedonia flaring up. A guerrilla type war of\r\nattrition is conceivable but with limited targets (autonomy for the\r\nAlbanians within a well defined swathe of territory). These demands\r\nwill be finally met because the Macedonians are hedonists, peaceful and\r\neasygoing as opposed to the neurotically tense Albanians and Serbs.\r\nBlood may be spilled in the process - but sparsely and symbolically. No\r\nmajor disruption will occur. The economy will thrive on the conflict.\r\nIt is a pathological, parasitic, short-term kind of prosperity - but it\r\nis prosperity, althesame.\r\n\r\nIt is when the area clams down sufficiently for the West to lose\r\ninterest - that Macedonia should begin to worry. Who will then finance\r\nthe insane trade deficit? Who will support the eerily strong currency?\r\nWho will cater to the military needs of this nascent democracy? Who\r\nwill save it from its own robber barons, crony capitalists, corrupt\r\npoliticians and outright criminals?\r\n\r\nThe only hope is foreign investments. It is worth repeating. Macedonia\r\ncan achieve market discipline, functioning public institutions, a\r\ntolerable level of corruption and internal economic (and thereby\r\npolitical) stability only through the discipline imposed by foreigners.\r\nPerhaps the Yugoslav Federation was not such a bad idea after all.\r\n\r\nIt is said that Tito drank only Czech beer. But Tito is dead and the\r\nlist of preferred immigration targets among all these warring\r\nnationalities does not include Prague. They would rather go to Germany\r\nor Russia. There is no real risk of a wave of refugees knocking down\r\nCzech border defences. But with its depressed economy and surging\r\ncrime, Prague regards every potential immigrant as a potential threat.\r\nIf the gates are not opened to them willingly - the refugees might\r\nchoose to knock them down.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Article published September 19-25, 1998 in \"Middle East Times\")\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Black Birds of Kosova\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Onset of Cultural Imperialism\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe real war over Kosovo hasn't even started yet. When NATO coerces\r\nYugoslavia into submission, when the smoke clears and the charred\r\nremains of corpses and houses cleared - then the REAL conflict will\r\nerupt. It will be a conflict between moderate Albanians (as represented\r\nby Ibrahim Rugova) and radical Albanians (the outlandish\r\nMaoist-Islamist admixture represented by the KLA). And it will be\r\nbloodier by far.\r\n\r\nThis is because this new type of war can never be decided, not even by\r\nway of weapons. It is a clash of cultures, a battle enjoined by\r\ncivilizations. And it cuts across the Kosovars as sharply as it\r\nseparates the West from Yugoslavia. Thus the Kosovo war will be\r\ncontinued by the Kosovars themselves because they, too, are culturally\r\nsplit along the same inflamed lines (Liberal versus Non-liberal). \"But,\r\nsurely\" - you would say - \"there is nothing new about THIS\". But there\r\nis.\r\n\r\nIn the past, nations or clusters of nations or tribes went to war ONLY\r\nin order to protect national or tribal or group interests. More food,\r\nmore space, control over important lines of transport and\r\ncommunications, access to markets, women (to ensure reproduction), the\r\nelimination of a foe or a potential foe, loot, weaponry - hard, cold\r\ninterests underlied all armed conflicts.\r\n\r\nCulture and religion were used as fig leaves to disguise the true\r\nnature of wars. The colonial wars of the 18th and 19th century were\r\nostensibly fought with the aim of educating the savages, converting\r\nthem to the right religion and bestowing upon them the blessings of\r\ncivilization. Mineral wealth, routes of transport, strategic vantage\r\npoints - were all presented as secondary afterthoughts or side\r\nbenefits. This is the way it was presented to the public. The truth, of\r\ncourse, was absolutely the opposite.\r\n\r\nThe Kosovo conflict is the first war in history where WYSIWYG (what you\r\nsee is what you get). Europe in general and NATO in particular have no\r\ninterests in the godforsaken piece of land known as Kosovo and\r\nMetoxhia. It is not strategically located (it is all but inaccessible).\r\nIt is poor (except some minerals of which there is a world glut). It is\r\nnot strictly \"European\". It is partly Moslem and allied with the likes\r\nof Iran, Osama Bin Laden and Albania. It involves a small number of\r\npeople (1.8 million). Operation Allied Force is NOT about the defence\r\nor furthering of self-interests. It is about conflicting cultures.\r\n\r\nThe West is trying to impose its culture - liberal and capitalist -\r\nupon other societies. Whenever popular opinion (even if expressed\r\ndemocratically and peacefully) does not conform to Western values - the\r\nWest does its best to undermine the choice as well as the chosen. The\r\nWest's definition of a legitimate regime is very peculiar and not very\r\nrigorous logically. A legitimate regime is one chosen by the people\r\nproviding its values are Western values or closely conform to them. All\r\nother regimes - no matter how strongly upheld by free public opinion -\r\nare not legitimate, even illegal and can be deposed and disposed of\r\nwith moral impunity. Khomeini came to power on the crest of a wave of\r\nunprecedented popular support and he supplanted a cruel and corrupt\r\ndictator. Milosevic was freely elected by a majority wider than\r\nClinton's. In Algeria and Turkey freely elected Islamists governments\r\nwere toppled (or prevented from taking office, in the case of Algeria)\r\nby the army with the West's enthusiastic though mute consent. This\r\n\"Allende Syndrome\" is in play now in Kosovo.\r\n\r\nIt is politically very incorrect, I am sure, to say that only a small\r\nminority of humans adhere to Western values (and most of the adherents\r\nonly pay lip service to them). Human rights are an alien concept in\r\nAfrica and the Balkans. Individualism is an alien - even repulsive -\r\nconcept in China, Japan and most of South East Asia. Competition is a\r\nvalue derided in most parts of the world. Income disparity and the\r\ntoleration of abject poverty as an inescapable consequence of\r\ncapitalism (the \"Anglo-Saxon Model\") are rejected even in Continental\r\nEurope itself. Freedom of Speech is much more curtailed in France than\r\nin the USA. Privacy is less respected in the USA than in France.\r\nWestern values are not universal even in the West.\r\n\r\nThe nations and societies of the Balkans are used to solving their\r\nproblems by employing ethnic cleansing, armed brutality, suppression of\r\ncivilian population and decimation of the elites of the enemy. This is\r\nnot a value judgement. It is a statement of historical fact. Bulgaria\r\nhas done it to its Turkish citizens as late as 1995. It used to be the\r\nsame (and much worse) in Western Europe until 1945. Nations - like\r\nhuman beings - have a growth trajectory. It cannot be hastened or\r\nimported. It must grow from within, by integrating experiences,\r\nincluding painful and traumatic ones. Peaceful co-existence often\r\nfollows and is the result of a devastation so great that no other\r\nalternative but peaceful co-existence is left. Any foreign intervention\r\nserves only to exacerbate the situation by increasing the number and\r\nintensity of inter-ethnic grudges. The seeds of the current conflict in\r\nKosovo were sown by the Ottoman Turks as early as 1912. Foreign\r\ninterventions tend to boomerang in the Balkans. Actually, they\r\nboomerang everywhere. Ask Israelis how they fared in the Lebanese\r\nquagmire.\r\n\r\nThe West should have respected the Balkanian way of conducting their\r\naffairs and resolving their differences. It should have left them to\r\nslaughter each other in peace. These are young nations (having been\r\nfreed from all foreign occupation only as late as 1945 after centuries\r\nof subjugation). They need to learn from their OWN experiences. They\r\nneed to reach the point of exhaustion beyond which there is only\r\npeaceful co-existence. Violence solves nothing, on the contrary, it\r\njust reinforces the Balkanian conviction that he who carries the big\r\nstick has justice on his side.\r\n\r\nBut how did this apparent transition from interest-wars to culture-wars\r\ntranspire?\r\n\r\nIndeed, the transition is only apparent. The key is the transformation\r\nof culture from something ethereal and transcendent - to a strong\r\nself-interest as any other. Once culture became an asset to protect,\r\ncultural wars were certain to erupt. Thus, it is still self-interest at\r\nthe basis of it all but this time the self-interest protected and\r\nfurthered is cultural dominance and hegemony.\r\n\r\nIt started rather innocuously and inadvertently. The Americanisation of\r\nthe world was perceived to be the historical equivalent of the Pox\r\nRomania. This was a false analogy. The Pox Romania was rampant\r\npluralism. The Pox Americana is rampant homogeneity.\r\n\r\nThen the West (notably America) suddenly realized the economic\r\ndividends on cultural homogeneity (for instance as evident in various\r\nforms of intellectual property - movies, music, software, TV,\r\ninternet). Culture - the oft-neglected stepsister of economics - became\r\nan INDUSTRY. A money-spinner. It was well worth the West's while not\r\nonly to sell mass produces culture to homogenized markets - but also to\r\nmake sure that these markets were peaceful, stable, accessible and\r\nfree. If necessary, this was to be secured by force.\r\n\r\nParadoxically, in this age of moral relativity and political\r\ncorrectness - the West is ASHAMED to admit that this is a cultural war\r\nwhere one of the parties is trying to impose its cultural values on the\r\nother for utterly utilitarian reasons. Instead, the war is presented as\r\na matter of national interest of the OLD TYPE.\r\n\r\nBut then what IS the OLD TYPE of the national interest of the USA,\r\nEurope, EU and NATO? Isn't it the preservation and immutability of\r\nexisting borders? The suppression of irredentist and separatist\r\nmovements? The abolition of terror? The prevention of large-scale\r\ndislocations of endemic populations? And if so, wasn't the best way to\r\nensure all the above - to allow Milosevic to cruelly and ruthlessly\r\neradicate the KLA and intimidate the local population into submission?\r\nHasn't the West adopted these very tactics (of encouraging local\r\nbullies to suppress and even eliminate local restive populations) in\r\nLatin America in the 70's and 80's and in Africa in the 60's and 70's?\r\nDidn't the West (wisely) turn a blind eye on China, Russia, Israel,\r\nIraq (prior to 1990) and others only recently when they did to their\r\npopulation what Milosevic did not dare to do to his?\r\n\r\nThe Kosovo war - it is clear - is CONTRARY to any conceivable OLD TYPE\r\nself-interest of the West. It costs the West dearly and will cost it\r\neven more - and not only in monetary terms. The loss of prestige, moral\r\nstanding, world support, economic resources, world trade (the blocking\r\nof the Danube) far outweighs any possible rendition of the old school\r\n\"national interest\". It is the protection and propagation of the West's\r\nculture that is at stake, replete with human rights, civil rights,\r\ncapitalism, individualism and liberalism. It is a defining war - not\r\nonly militarily (the future of NATO) but also culturally (the identity\r\nof the future global market). Poor Milosevic, look what he got himself\r\ninto.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Article published May 10, 1999 in \"The New Presence\")\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Defrosted War\r\n\r\n\r\nRussia's Role in a Brave, New World\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA president (almost) impeached. An important politician sacked due to\r\nincompetence. Business tycoons under investigation. The USA? No, this\r\nis the new, post-communist, Russia. Many firsts, meagre experience,\r\nnumerous blunders. Is it democracy in action? No, it is simply\r\nautocracy exposed. The same machinations went on in Ivan the Terrible's\r\ncourt, the same conspiracies enshrouded Peter the Great's cabin, the\r\nsame conflicts besieged Stalin. Ask Khrushchev.\r\n\r\nThe great mistake of the West is the deeply ingrained naive belief in\r\nprogress. History is cyclical. Otherwise we could have learned nothing\r\nfrom it. The nations of the Balkans will still be dividing and\r\nre-dividing their blood stained enclaves and the Russians will still be\r\nunder autocratic rule and the Americans will still be moralizing in the\r\nyear 3000. History teaches us fatalism or, at least, determinism.\r\n\r\nRussian autocrats refined the art of divide et impera (divide and\r\nrule). They always had a keen eye for conflicting interests. They\r\npitted one group against another dangling carrots aplenty in front of\r\nthe drooling vassals. The recent shuffle was no different.\r\n\r\nThere are three major camps in Russia today. There are the \"Reformists\"\r\n- young, well-educated, pro Western, with economic savvy,\r\nforward-looking, corrupt. There is the \"Old Guard\" - old, guarded,\r\nbackward, centralist, anti Western (actually, anti American), corrupt.\r\nAnd there are the nationalists - ideologically eclectic, rigid,\r\nradical, dangerous, corrupt.\r\n\r\nYeltsin is the ultimate puppet master. The Old Guard was good to\r\nstabilize a nose-diving economy and a disintegrating body politic. They\r\nnew where the levers are and how to use them, they possessed all the\r\nright dossiers, they were chums with the Communist Duma. But they\r\nproved to be too independent and too dangerous. They aspired to the\r\npresidency (Primakov). They were too anti-Western and, thus, risked the\r\nonly reliable source of financing in the absence of tax collection (the\r\nIMF funds). They espoused geopolitical brinkmanship. They were cold war\r\nin an era of defrosted war. There is no money in cold war mantras. In\r\nan age when money is the only ideology - they did not adhere to the\r\nparty line. They posed a threat not only to Yeltsin's authority - but\r\nalso to the economic well being of Russia.\r\n\r\nHaving looked into the abyss in the early stages of the Kosovo crisis\r\n(remember the re-directed ballistic nuclear missiles) - Yeltsin engaged\r\nin a surprisingly elegant volte-face. He appointed Chernomyrdin, a\r\npro-Western, quasi-Reformist, to contain the Kosovo damage. And he\r\nfired Primakov, the hawk. The IMF gave Russia 4.5 billion dollars that\r\nit swore blue in the face not to give Russia only a month before. A\r\ncoincidence, needless to add.\r\n\r\nYeltsin doesn't give a hoot about Kosovo. All he wanted was to\r\nre-establish his domestic authority and to quash especially insolent\r\nand increasingly dangerous investigations into his murky financial\r\ndealings. Kosovo was an added bonus. A joker in an already excellent\r\nhand. Yeltsin put it to deft use.\r\n\r\nBy sending Chernomyrdin to sort out the Balkan mess, Yeltsin killed a\r\nflock of birds with nary a stone. He signalled to the West that a\r\npro-Western, pro-Reformist team is in control again and that the bad\r\nguys have been consigned to oblivion. He signalled to the Duma and to\r\npoliticians of every colour and denomination who is the boss. The Duma\r\ntook the hint and promptly dropped the impeachment charges and\r\nconfirmed the nondescript (but very ominous) Stepashin as the next\r\nscapegoat. He enhanced the geopolitical standing of Russia and already\r\nconverted some of it into hard cash, averting an otherwise certain\r\ndefault of the Russian Federation. He allied himself with most of the\r\n\"progressives\" and \"liberals\" of the world from China to the Guardian\r\nin London. And, in his role as peacekeeper, he effectively extricated\r\nRussia from the war psychosis that Messrs. Primakov et al. were trying\r\nto plunge Russia into.\r\n\r\nBut why did the West - especially the USA - collaborate with this St.\r\nVitus dance?\r\n\r\nBecause they wanted Yeltsin o achieve all the above goals. Because it\r\nserved to neutralize Russia as a potential, backdoor combatant, a-la\r\nVietnam. Because they really had no more effective channel of\r\ncommunication to Milosevic. Because it is better to have your dependent\r\nas mediator - then a real independent. Because they had o choice: many\r\nNATO members would have protested had Russia's help been rejected. And\r\nbecause Russia has to be part of any future settlement.\r\n\r\nSometimes, as Freud said, a cigar is just a cigar. Only this time it is\r\na smoking cigar. There is more to the intricate USA-Russian\r\nchoreography than meets the eye. The USA is in no hurry to finish this\r\nparticular \"air campaign\". Meetings are scheduled a week apart. The\r\nsame proposals and the same envoys keep shuttling back and forth.\r\n\r\nThis is because Russia and the USA see eye to eye. They want Serbia\r\nweakened and Milosevic dead (if possible). They understand that \"Great\r\nSerbia\" is Milosevic's dream - but the world's nightmare. Everyone is\r\nholding out. Everyone - Russia included - want the Serbs to cease to be\r\na viable fighting force. As time passes, Russia will become more and\r\nmore confrontational but this time the culprit and the recipient of\r\ntheir vitriolic diatribes is likely to be Milosevic. It is good for the\r\nWest and it is good for Russia because it is Russia that will fill in\r\nthe vacuum left by the debris of the Milosevic regime. The USA couldn't\r\nbe happier. It wants out of the Balkan - never to come back.\r\n\r\nAt this stage, the poor nations of the Balkan are deluded into\r\nbelieving in a future, Western sponsored, \"Balkan Marshal Plan\". They\r\nare in for a rude awakening. The minute the war ends - the USA will\r\nvanish, leaving the resulting mess to the natives, to a fragmented\r\nEurope and to Russia, who asked for it by getting involved.\r\n\r\nThe only money likely to be invested in the region by the USA is in the\r\nreconstruction of the Chinese embassy.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Article written on May 19, 1999 and published May 24, 1999\r\n\r\nin \"The New Presence\")\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bones of the Grenadier\r\n\r\n\r\nEndgame in the Balkans\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe (cyclical) victory of capitalism led westerners of all colours and\r\nstripes to believe in solving problems by throwing money at them.\r\nProsperity, international trade, foreign investment, globalisation and\r\njoint ventures are the new magic formulas. Mathematically put this\r\nsuperstition is often presented thus: the propensity to fight decreases\r\nin direct proportion to the amount of economic common interests of the\r\npotential rivals. Thus, instead of tackling core issues - the West\r\ntries to drown them in a green deluge of US dollars. Where the west\r\nshould have tackled a corrupt and autocratic mentality (Russia) - it\r\ncommits funds through the IMF instead. Where it should have applied\r\nitself to interethnic tensions and rivalries (the politically correct\r\nphrase denoting racism) - it rebuilds infrastructure.\r\n\r\nIf the \"throw money at the problem\" theorem were right - and it never\r\nwas, not even once in human history - the Yugoslav wars of secession\r\nand succession would have never erupted. Former Yugoslavia was\r\neconomically independent and prosperous. It constituted an effective\r\nand dynamic free trade zone between its six constituent republics.\r\nResources were allocated within it with reasonable efficiency.\r\nMacedonia produced raw materials. Slovenia processed them. Croatia\r\nconsumed them, added some industrial products of its own and all of\r\nthem traded with Serbia, the seat of the administration. Yugoslavia was\r\nrather self sufficient and conducted much of its value added and\r\ntrading activities in-house. The gap between its GDP and GNP only a\r\ndecade ago, reflects what used to be this rather efficient and\r\nlucrative market, a mini-EU in the Balkans. The envy of all other\r\nsocialist countries it was mooted to become member of the EU (then, the\r\nEEC) when the thought of the Czech Republic as a member would have\r\nelicited condescending smiles. Heavy industry, light manufacturing,\r\nconstruction and engineering all flourished. Yugoslavia's exports\r\nboomed. It had a proto-capitalistic system of ownership and a\r\nJapanese-style system of management. It introduced the IMF and its\r\nreforms in 1980, when Tito was still alive and years before any other\r\nsocialist country. The reforms of Ante Markovic (the 1989-91 federal\r\nprime minister) are still a model of \"free enterprise with a socialist\r\nbend\". On purely economic grounds, the Yugoslav wars were and are a\r\ncolossal insanity.\r\n\r\nThe new Yugoslavia endured economic devastation to fight a losing war\r\naimed at securing the interests and safety of Serb minorities in the\r\nnewly formed Republics of former Yugoslavia (NOT to establish a\r\n\"Greater Serbia\" as Western propaganda has it). Macedonia withstood a\r\nmultiple embargo by its neighbours Greece and Bulgaria because it\r\nwouldn't change its name or the historical status of its language. The\r\neconomic price that Macedonia was forced to pay was mind boggling (the\r\naffair with Greece is dormant now but far from over) - and it was\r\nnothing compared to the Serb tally. The Jews, in contrast, were busy\r\nsigning economic agreements with Germans less than 6 years after the\r\nholocaust. A different order of priorities, surely.\r\n\r\nHaving lived in the Balkans and worked there for almost a decade, I am\r\nforced to conclude that economic arguments are absolutely meaningless\r\nwhen they clash with the proud and romantic nationalism of the likes of\r\nthe Serbs. If offered in isolation, economic incentives will do nothing\r\nto reduce future conflicts or contain them. Marshal plans, future EU\r\nmembership (or current EU \"new\" association), IMF soft loans, World\r\nBank effective grants - will all fail to preclude future armed\r\nconflicts as they have always failed in the past.\r\n\r\nTake Bosnia-Herzegovina. By now, the West - through the various organs\r\nof its global financial architecture - has committed well over 5\r\nbillion USD to this godforsaken piece of land in the middle of nowhere.\r\nThis is almost 3 times the official GDP of this country. It is the\r\nequivalent of 20 trillion US dollars invested in the USA in four years\r\ntime. All this was in order to cement the cohesiveness of this\r\nartificial concoction of a state and to secure its future as a\r\npolitical (read: economic) unit. It failed, miserably so. The Republika\r\nSrpska is nowhere nearer to integrating with its Moslem and Croat\r\nneighbour. The common currency did nothing to foster a common identity.\r\nAnd the place represents an abysmal reversion to old colonial habits\r\nwith a governor to regulate the unruly and unyielding natives, by the\r\napplication of force if need be.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the ethnic wars of the modern era are a direct result of said\r\ncolonial period. Borders, drawn at random and with a minimal and\r\narbitrary knowledge of the terrain and its inhabitants - led to a\r\nhundred years of correctional warfare by the victims of this\r\npatronizing ignorance. The rule of thumb is simple: people cannot live\r\ntogether. Humans are misanthropes, they love to hate the different, the\r\nother. Therefore, it is best to encourage the formation of ethnically\r\nhomogenous political units - where ethnic affiliation counts and of\r\nideologically homogenous political units where ideology matters and of\r\nracially homogenous political bodies where race equals identity. A\r\nsimple rule derived from the 5000 years of trials and errors called\r\n\"human history\".\r\n\r\nThe USSR disintegrated peacefully because it disintegrated into\r\nethnically homogenous entities (or entities with clear ethnic\r\nidentities and majorities). In the process Russia gave up oil reserves,\r\nmineral riches, space launching sites, strategic locations and much of\r\nits nuclear and conventional weaponry. Despite all these incredible\r\nsacrifices, it was a peaceful process.\r\n\r\nThe Czechs separated from the Slovaks in a bloodless break-up of their\r\ncommon state because the two resulting entities were ethnically\r\nhomogenous. Well, almost - hence the persecution of the Roma in both\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nSlovenia and Macedonia seceded from the Yugoslav Federation without as\r\nmuch as a shot (except for the first few days of Slovenia's\r\nindependence when confusion ruled supreme) - because there were very\r\nfew Serbs in either. Slovenia and Macedonia are ethnically homogeneous\r\n(Macedonia with a sizeable Albanian minority, though). Hence their\r\nstatus as islands of peace and tranquillity in an impossible region.\r\nThe war with Croatia and more so in Bosnia was a direct result of\r\nethnic heterogeneity.\r\n\r\nThe not-so-implicit deal in the case of the USSR and the Czech Republic\r\nwas simple to grasp and very effective. \"You will peacefully break up\r\ninto ethnically homogeneous units - and we will support you financially\r\nand initiate you into our economic superstructures.\" It worked. It\r\nstill is working. But it was not the deal offered to the former\r\nYugoslav republics. To them the West's message was: \"You will\r\npeacefully break up into ethnically HETEROGENEOUS units - and we will\r\nsupport you financially, subject to painful and sustained reforms.\"\r\n\r\nIt is time to recognize the folly and the fallacy of this last message.\r\nYugoslavia in particular and the Balkans in general must be\r\n\"re-designed\" into ethnically homogeneous political units. If this\r\nnecessitates the re-drawing of now dangerously obsolete borders - let\r\nit be so. It would make a lot more sense to dismantle Bosnia and unite\r\nthe Republika Srpska with Yugoslavia (Serbia) and the Croat bit with\r\nCroatia. The Muslims can have their political unit, if they wish. Parts\r\nof Kosovo must go to Albania. The borders have to be redrawn. The\r\nresult should be a series of ethnically homogeneous states - viable,\r\ncohesive, peaceful and able to concentrate on economic warfare rather\r\nthan on the economics of war.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this goal, colonialism must be revived. Operation Allied\r\nForce is a colonial war without the mercantilist emphasis of days gone\r\nby. It is a coalition of rich countries, led by a superpower, attacking\r\nand subduing a regional bully. As in the good old days, borders are\r\neffectively redrawn (Kosovo's \"extensive self government\"), new\r\npolitical entities formed, alliances with one group of natives against\r\nanother abound, military hardware coupled with economic prowess are\r\npitted against local aspirations which do not conform with a moralistic\r\n\"global view\" of the world. The absurd is that - because colonialism is\r\nnot politically correct and is condemned by all with great vehemence -\r\nthe colonial powers of today are castrated. These eunuchs of\r\ngeopolitics do not dare to carry their military and economic clout to\r\nits logical and beneficial conclusion. In other words: they do not dare\r\nto DICTATE a solution and impose it rather than engage in endless\r\nconsultations with local parties and amongst themselves.\r\n\r\nWe need a new Berlin Congress. We need a new Bismarck. He said that the\r\nwhole Balkan is not worth the bones of one Pomeranian grenadier - but\r\nthis did not prevent the newly born (and recently victorious) Germany\r\nfrom engaging in the redesign of South Europe. Unfortunately, the\r\nBerlin Congress was a shoddy job, more influenced by the narrow\r\nself-interests of the participants than by any grand vision or\r\nintegrity of intentions. To the reshapers of Europe of that time it was\r\nmore important to adversely affect the interests of Russia and Turkey\r\nthan to create a long lasting peace and the conditions for prosperity.\r\nIt was bound to fail and it did and it still does.\r\n\r\nThis is the second chance (not counting communism). This is the time to\r\nredefine South Europe and the Balkans. This is the time to draw logical\r\nborders, which reflect not whims and eccentricities, paranoias and\r\nignorance, condescension and malice - but demography and history,\r\nnational aspirations and disparate cultures and narratives. Let each\r\nethnic group live within safe and internationally guaranteed borders.\r\nLet them work in harmony across borders - rather than engage in\r\nconflicts within them. Let the Albanian lands go to Albania, the\r\nSerbian lands to the Serbs - as the Czech lands are to the Czech and\r\nRussian lands are to the Russian. Only then will peace prevail as it\r\ndoes in Western Europe and in Scandinavia today - the scenes of\r\ncenturies of battles and bloodshed.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Article published May 31, 1999 in \"The New Presence\")\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMillenarian Thoughts about Kosovo\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"English persons, therefore, of humanitarian and reformist disposition\r\nconstantly went out to the Balkan Peninsula to see who was in fact\r\nill-treating whom, and, being by the very nature of their perfectionist\r\nfaith unable to accept the horrid hypothesis that everybody was\r\nill-treating everybody else, all came back with a pet Balkan people\r\nestablished in their hearts as suffering and innocent, eternally the\r\nmassacree and never the massacrer.\"\r\n\r\n(\"Black Lamb and Grey Falcon - A Journey through Yugoslavia\" by Rebecca\r\nWest - Penguin Books 1994 edition p.20)\r\n\r\n\r\nRebecca West's book was first published in 1940. By that time, it was\r\ncommon wisdom that the Balkans is the place where the destiny of our\r\nworld is determined or, at the very least, outlined. Had she lived\r\ntoday, she would have had no reason to revise this particular judgement\r\nof hers.\r\n\r\nThe Kosovo \"air campaign\" exposed and brought to culmination a series\r\nof historical processes whose importance cannot be exaggerated.\r\n\r\nThe Russian Revolution\r\n\r\nForced to choose between nationalist delusions of imperial grandeur and\r\nmodern capitalism and its attendant, individualism - Russia chose the\r\nlatter. The ever-surprising Yeltsin completed the revolution he started\r\nin 1990 by deposing of the last vestiges of stagnation personified by\r\nPrimakov. The remnants of the former nomenclature, the establishment\r\nfigures, the fossils in the ideological swamp that communism has become\r\n- were given the penultimate slip. Russia was forced to peer into the\r\nabyss of its own corruption, nepotism, criminality, social and\r\npolitical disintegration and military impotence. It was forced to do so\r\nby the developments in the Kosovo crisis. It was made to elect between\r\npan-Slavism and pan-capitalism. For a while, it seemed to have been\r\nchoosing the former - leading to an inevitable and suicidal\r\nconfrontation with the victorious civilization of the West. Then it\r\nrecoiled and chose the IMF over the KGB, material goods over\r\nideological fervour, the new myths of modernity over the old ones of\r\nblood-steeped patriotism.\r\n\r\nIt is a momentous event, the consequences of which cannot yet be fully\r\nfathomed. Extrapolating Russian history, it would be reasonable to\r\nexpect a backlash in the form of a counterrevolution. A communist\r\ncounter-revolution being unlikely - we can expect a fascist-criminal\r\ncounter-revolution. But it is as safe to assume that the revolution is\r\nirreversible, setbacks aside. It is irreversible because for the first\r\ntime it generated vested interests not only for a select elite - but\r\nalso for everyone. Prosperity tends to trickle down and, as it does\r\n(forming a middle class in its wake) - it knows no boundaries of class.\r\nThe real revolution has just been completed in Russia, 70 years after\r\nLenin's death. And all classes are about to win.\r\n\r\nThe Second Cold War\r\n\r\nThe outlines of the second cold war have emerged. It is to be fought\r\nbetween a prosperous, almighty, vainglorious, narcissistic,\r\nself-righteous, contemptuous and increasingly disintegrating USA and an\r\nequally disintegrating China on the economic ascendant.\r\n\r\nThe second cold war (already in progress) is fought not between foes -\r\nbut between partners. The extent of economic interests common to the\r\ntwo current combatants far exceeds anything achieved in the high\r\nmoments of detente between the USA and its previous rival, Russia. This\r\ncold war is about markets and cultural dominance - not sheer,\r\nprojected, military prowess. It is a throwback to earlier days of\r\ncolonialism and mercantilism and it is laden with historical memories\r\nand sensitivities.\r\n\r\nThe aims are different, as well. China wishes to force the USA to throw\r\nopen the gates of the global marketplace, currently zealously guarded\r\nby the only superpower. The IMF, the World Bank, the WTO are all\r\nbelieved to be extensions of the American economic clout, put to the\r\nuse of its geopolitical interests. Russia forced its way into the G8\r\nbut China has much loftier ambitions. It is not in pursuit of\r\nmembership in gentlemen's clubs - it aspires to real, raw power. It\r\nwants to carve the world between itself and the West. In short, it\r\nwants to dominate and to export and it wants the West to help it do so.\r\nIn return, it promises regional and internal stability and access to\r\nits markets. To convince the West of the quality of its wares, China\r\ndemonstrates its capacity to destabilize in various corners of the\r\nworld. It transfers weapons technology, support international terrorism\r\nand rogue states and, in general, places formidable obstacles in the\r\npath to Pax Americana, the New World Order.\r\n\r\nThe Americans regard this as a reasonable deal but they wish to reverse\r\nthe cause and the effect. First, they want to gain unhindered access to\r\nthe potentially infinite Chinese market and to have the Chinese deliver\r\nthe regional and international stability they claim to be able to\r\ndeliver. Only then are they willing to contemplate the coveted prize of\r\ngraduating to the co-ownership of the world financial and economic\r\narchitecture.\r\n\r\nChina is fighting for legitimacy, recognition, access to markets,\r\ncapital and technology and the ability to reshape the world in its\r\nfavour. The USA is fighting to check progress of the Chinese on all\r\nthese fronts. Such fundamental differences are bound to lead to\r\nconflict - as, indeed, they have.\r\n\r\nIn this sense, the bombing of the Chinese embassy has been an\r\nauspicious event because it allowed both parties to break through, to\r\nunlock and a deadlock and to make progress towards a fuller integration\r\nof China into the WTO, for instance. It also legitimised the airing of\r\ngrievances against the style and conduct of the USA in world affairs.\r\nIn short, it was cathartic and useful.\r\n\r\nThe Demise of the Client States\r\n\r\nThe concept of the client states is so well entrenched in our\r\nhistorical consciousness that its demise has been denied and repressed.\r\nThere are no longer alliances between powerful political units (such as\r\nthe USA) and smaller, dependent, satellites. The kaleidoscopically\r\nshifting interests of the few remaining global powers dictate\r\ngeopolitical transigence and ideological transparency. These adaptive\r\nprocesses lead to a myriad of alliances, forever changing to fit the\r\nneeds and interests of the moment or to cater to future contingencies.\r\nThus, Russia ignores Yugoslavia's pleas for help, China allows the USA,\r\nJapan and South Korea to conduct direct negotiations with North Korea,\r\nAmerica bullies Israel into a settlement with the Palestinians (who\r\nsupport Iraq), the UK and the USA impose a peace plan on the IRA,\r\nRussia respects an embargo imposed on both Iraq and Yugoslavia and so\r\non. These are the roots of a truly global order. It is also the death\r\nknell for rogue and \"insane\" states. Devoid of their patronage, these\r\ncountries are gradually tamed by the awesome twin forces of the global\r\nmarket and international capital and information flows. Iran moderates,\r\nLibya surrenders, Yugoslavia succumbs, the only exception being Iraq.\r\n\r\nThis is NOT to say that warfare is a thing of the past. On the very\r\ncontrary. In the absence of the overwhelmingly restraining impulses and\r\nimpositions of the superpowers - ethnic strife, border skirmishes, the\r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction - all are likely to\r\nincrease. But these are already affairs of limited importance, confined\r\nto parts of the world of limited importance, and fought amongst people\r\nof ever more limited importance. War marginalizes the warriors because\r\nit takes them out of the circulation of capital, information and goods.\r\nDecoupled from these essential flows, warring parties wither and\r\nshrivel.\r\n\r\nThe Convergence of Economic and Military Alliances\r\n\r\nThe Kosovo crisis started as an exercise in self re-definition. NATO\r\nused it to successfully put its cohesiveness to test. It acted sanely\r\nand its hypercomplex set of checks and balances and more checks scored\r\nan impressive success. As a result, the limited aims and means of the\r\ncampaign were maintained and NATO was not dragged into either British\r\nbelligerence or Italian and Greek defeatism. It was the second time in\r\nrecent history (the first being another multilateral military campaign\r\nin the Gulf in 1991) - that a military move did not degenerate into\r\nfull-scale insanity of carnage and bloodshed.\r\n\r\nNATO emerged as a self-restrained, well-choreographed, well\r\nco-ordinated body of professionals who go through motions and off the\r\nshelf plans with lifeless automatism. While somewhat aesthetically\r\nrepulsive, this image is a great deterrent. We fear cold-blooded,\r\nimpartial machines of war more than we do any hot-blooded,\r\nsword-wielding fanatic. NATO acted with the famous German industrial\r\nefficiency that gave warfare a bad name. It was \"surgically precise\"\r\nand civilian casualties were alchemically converted into \"collateral\r\ndamage\". The well-practised Jamie Shea is an exceptionally chilling\r\nsight.\r\n\r\nThus, a policeman was born to police the emerging world of\r\ninternational commerce, true multinationals, boundary-less flows of\r\ndata and chaotic reactions to changes in local variables. This\r\npoliceman is NATO and it wields an awesome club. As it chooses which\r\ncriminals to discipline, it transforms the nature of previously unruly\r\nneighbourhoods. For this, at least, we should be grateful.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Article published June 6, 1999 in \"The New Presence\")\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNATO's Next War\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe real, protracted, war is about to start. NATO and the international\r\npeacekeeping force against an unholy - and, until recently, improbable\r\n- alliance. Milosevic (or post-Milosevic Serbia) and the KLA against\r\nthe occupying forces. It is going to be ferocious. It is going to be\r\nbloody. And it is going to be a Somali nightmare.\r\n\r\nWhy should the KLA and Serbia collaborate against NATO (I use NATO here\r\nas shorthand for \"The International Peacekeeping Force - KFOR\")?\r\n\r\nSerbia - because it wants to regain its lost sovereignty over at least\r\nthe northern part of Kosovo. Because it virulently hates,\r\nwholeheartedly detests, voluptuously despises NATO, the \"Nazi\r\naggressor\" of yester month. Serbia has no natural allies left, not even\r\nRussia, which prostituted its geopolitical favours for substantial IMF\r\nfunding. Its only remaining natural ally is the KLA.\r\n\r\nThe KLA stands to lose everything as a result of the latest bout of\r\npeacemaking. It is supposed to be \"decommissioned\" IRA-style, disarmed\r\n(\"demilitarised\" in the diplomatic argot) and effectively disbanded.\r\nThe KLA's political clout rested on its ever-growing arsenal and body\r\nof volunteers. Yet volunteers have a strange habit of going back whence\r\nthey came once a conflict is over. And the weapons are to be\r\nsurrendered. Devoid of these two pillars of political might - Thaci may\r\nfind himself unemployed, a former self-declared Prime Minister of a\r\nshadow government in Albanian exile. Rugova has the coffers, filled to\r\nthe brim with tens of millions of US dollars and DM raised from the\r\nAlbanian Diaspora worldwide. Money talks, KLA walks. Bad for the KLA.\r\nHaving tasted power, having met cher Albright on a regular basis,\r\nhaving conversed with Tony Blair and Robertson and even Clinton via\r\nexpensive high tech gadgets - Thaci is not likely to compromise on a\r\nsecond rate appointment in a Rugova led administration.\r\n\r\nAnd the bad news is that he doesn't have to. Bolstered by a\r\nshort-sighted and panicky NATO, the KLA post-bellum is not what it used\r\nto be ante-bellum. It is well equipped. It is well financed. Its ranks\r\nhave swelled. It has been transformed from an agglomeration of\r\ndesperadoes - to a military guerrilla force to be reckoned with. Even\r\nthe Serbs found that out at a dear price.\r\n\r\nWith the Serb pullout from Kosovo, Serbia is no longer the KLA'a enemy\r\nof choice. The KLA has seen the enemy and it is NATO. The pro-Rugova\r\ndemonstrations in the camps (despite Rugova's Quisling show with\r\nMilosevic and his refusal to explain his motives and to adopt a stern\r\nposition against the Serbs) - sounded loud and clear. Thaci picked up\r\nthe signal.\r\n\r\nNo Kosovar autonomy can do without Serbia. Kosovo is connected to\r\nSerbia by way of infrastructure. All its trade is with Yugoslavia. It\r\nis absolutely dependent on Serbia for its energy needs. Rugova knows\r\nthis. Thaci knows this. And Milosevic knows this. Only NATO pretends\r\nthat Kosova can survive as an independent, economically viable entity.\r\nIt cannot. It is a part of Serbia, willy-nilly and it will continue to\r\nbe so. Rugova and Thaci will be positioning themselves accordingly and\r\nwill seek the favours of the only regional force that really matters:\r\nSerbia. Rumour has it that discussion have already commenced in Prague\r\nbetween Yugoslav low-level officials and Rugova and Thaci\r\nrepresentatives of their competing administrations.\r\n\r\nIn conducting these discussions, Milosevic's aim is two-fold. Divide et\r\nimpera - he intends to do his best to inflame the nascent internecine\r\ncivil war about to erupt in Kosovo. By offering goodies to both camps,\r\nSerbia pits them against one another. By being inconsistent and\r\nunpredictable (remember Serbia's refugees policy?) - the Serbs enhance\r\na Kosovar personality disorder. Dazed by the arbitrariness and\r\ncapriciousness of a vicious neighbour - the Kosovars will lash at each\r\nother in an effort to offload their frustration and aggression.\r\n\r\nLucky Serbia. Its infrastructure all but eradicated - it will enjoy the\r\nbest and latest replacements courtesy a multitude of international\r\nfinancial institutions and NGOs. Materially revamped, nationally\r\nrevived, militarily vindicated, an invigorated power that withstood the\r\nmightiest alliance in history - Serbia is in an excellent position to\r\nemerge as an important, nay, indispensable, regional, pivotal player.\r\nIt can have its choice. In Rugova it will find a genteel, compliant,\r\nrespectable and submissive partner. In Thaci - a fellow bully. Serbia\r\ncan conduct business with both. As it tramples over internal dissent,\r\nsuppresses Montenegro and tightens its grip on its minorities - Serbia\r\nwill strive to split Kosovo. It will be content with the mineral-rich,\r\nhistorical north. Thaci will be content with any kind of foothold, a\r\nstepping-stone on the way to a Greater Albania. There are grounds for\r\ndoing business and business will be done, indeed.\r\n\r\nPoor Kosova. Lucky Serbia. With such opponents, one need not have\r\nfriends. And, in the background, NATO stumbles on into its worst\r\nnightmare, into an apocalyptic tapestry of exploding mines, KLA sniper\r\nfire and mortar attacks, Serb revanchism, material devastation, mass\r\nstarvation and geopolitical destabilization. It is this war: gradual,\r\nnerve wrecking, multi-annual, expensive, replete with body bags and\r\nhorror scenes - that will do NATO in. It is the end of NATO, only it\r\ndoes not know it. It has contracted the humanitarian cancer and its\r\ndays are numbered.\r\n\r\nMilosevic is smiling. He won the war. Completely. And the world has yet\r\nto learn it.\r\n\r\nPost Scriptum\r\n\r\nIt is ever so easy and rational to disregard the above scenario. It is\r\nabrupt, illogical, paradoxical. The Serbs and Milosevic are surely the\r\nKLA's worst enemies. No peace - even one mediated by a confluence of\r\ninterests - can blossom among the ruins of coexistence and trust\r\nshredded. A KLA supported by the Serbs against NATO is as outlandish as\r\nan Iraq supported by the USA against Israel.\r\n\r\nBut the Balkan is a region characterized by its fluid alliances and\r\nstructures. Rebecca West, in her masterpiece, \"Black Lamb and Grey\r\nFalcon\" tells of an alliance no less unholy and no more improbable than\r\na KLA-Milosevic one (pages 840-1 in the 1994 Penguin edition):\r\n\r\n\"It happened that the Slavs who had become Janissaries, especially the\r\nBosnian Serbs, who had been taken from their Christian mothers and\r\ntrained to forswear Christ and live in the obedience and enforcement of\r\nthe oppressive yet sluttish Ottoman law, had learned their lesson too\r\nwell. When the Turks themselves became alarmed by the working of that\r\nlaw and attempted to reform it, the Janissaries rose against the\r\nreformation. But because they remembered they were Slavs in spite of\r\nall the efforts that had been made to force them to forget it, they\r\nfelt that in resisting the Turks, even in defence of Turkish law, they\r\nwere resisting those who had imposed that Turkish law on them in place\r\nof their Christian system. So when the rebellious Janissaries defeated\r\nthe loyal Army of the Sultan in the fourth battle of Kosovo in 1831,\r\nand left countless Turkish dead on the field, they held that they had\r\navenged the shame laid on the Christian Slavs in the first battle of\r\nKosovo, although they themselves were Moslems. But their Christian\r\nfellow-Slavs gave them no support, for they regarded them simply as\r\nco-religionists of the Turkish oppressors and therefore as enemies. So\r\nthe revolt of the Janissaries failed; and to add the last touch of\r\nconfusion, they were finally defeated by a Turkish marshal who was\r\nneither Turk nor Moslem-born Slav, but a renegade Roman Catholic from\r\nDalmatia. Here was illustrated what is often obscured by historians,\r\nthat a people can be compelled by misfortune into an existence so\r\nconfused that it is not life but sheer nonsense, the malignant nonsense\r\nof cancerous growth.\"\r\n\r\nThis is reminiscent of the Gorani Moslems in 1999 Kosovo who\r\ncollaborated with the Serbs against their co-religionists, the\r\nAlbanians. They persecuted the Albanian population - looted, burned\r\nhouses and worse - more tenaciously and more ferociously than any Serb.\r\n\r\nIn hindsight, Milosevic would have done well to co-opt the KLA. By\r\npitting it against Rugova and provoking Rugova's camp against a\r\nstrengthened KLA - Milosevic could have incited a veritable, full\r\nfledged civil war among the Albanians. The West would have then begged\r\nhim to intervene in his by now traditional role of peacemaker. But\r\nhistory took a different turn. The returning Albanians will not forgive\r\nor forget. Retaliation has many faces, some less bloodied than others.\r\nBut retaliation will come. And while Milosevic may have won this battle\r\n- he may, indeed, have lost the war. Only history will tell.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Article published June 14, 1999 in \"The New Presence\")\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy did Milosevic Surrender?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNot because of NATO. Ground damage assessment based on the number of\r\nwithdrawing troops and their hardware and on a detailed inventory of\r\ncharred remains in most of Kosovo - prove that this air campaign was no\r\ndifferent to its predecessors. Only 10% of Serb artillery, tanks, APCs\r\nand so on were affected. The Yugoslav (read: Serb) army - ostensibly\r\nthe side that lost the war - is vibrant and defiant. It does not look\r\nlike it has been subjected to the equivalent of 12 Hiroshima size\r\nnuclear bombs in 11 weeks. It looks like it knows something that the\r\nrest of us don't.\r\n\r\nAnd it does.\r\n\r\nMilosevic did not surrender. He entrapped the West in his usual, wily\r\nstyle. He lured the west into a fatal hornets' nest, an unmanageable\r\ncapsule of centuries-old conflicts, a terrorists' lair, replete with\r\ndrug deals, gun smuggling and organized crime. Kosovo constitutes a\r\nmajor drugs route from the Golden Triangle, via Turkey, Afghanistan and\r\nIran to Europe. It is an integral part of the path leading - via the\r\npolluted Vardar River - from Greece to Montenegro. It is swarming with\r\nweapons traders, drug dealers, \"freedom fighters\", Muslim fanatics,\r\nspies, con artists, smugglers and common criminals. Every\r\nself-respecting mob is heavily represented there - from the ruthless\r\nBulgarian mafia to the murderous Russian one. The civilian population\r\nhas long been intimidated into co-operation in all these loathsome\r\n(though lucrative) activities. Many are only too happy to collaborate.\r\n\r\nMilosevic withdrew his forces - this is an undeniable fact. He did so\r\nafter he lost the backing of Russia. Russia sold him to the West and\r\ndisposed of the Old Guard, which supported him in the Kremlin. It was\r\nhandsomely rewarded by that long arm of the USA - the IMF. But Russia's\r\nbetrayal is not sufficient to account for the Serbian volte-face. The\r\nturnaround in Milosevic's position was too sudden and Russia's support\r\nhas always been more moral than military. Something else was at play.\r\n\r\nNotice the following hitherto unimaginable developments:\r\n\r\nMilosevic surrenders Kosovo to NATO occupation, including all its holy\r\nsites and lucrative mines. There is a conspicuous absence of domestic\r\nreaction by the likes of Seselji, the Serb ultra-nationalist. He quits\r\nthe government - a response eerily civilized judging by his previous\r\nrecord.\r\n\r\nThe stunning rapprochement between the Macedonian Prime Minister, an\r\nerstwhile nationalist and Albanian-buster, Ljubco Georgievski and the\r\nself-proclaimed KLA Kosovar \"Prime Minister\" Hashim Thaci. The two\r\nagree to open liaison offices in each others' capital cities and to\r\ncollaborate with Albania in the forthcoming reconstruction of the\r\nBalkan region. All this is happening as the Macedonian Minister of the\r\nInterior is accusing both the Serbs and the KLA of conducting\r\nsubversive activities on Macedonian soil with the aim of splitting\r\nMacedonia apart. All this happens as NATO begins to clash militarily\r\nwith an ever more defiant and cocksure KLA.\r\n\r\nThe Russians flex their 200-men muscles in an enclave in the Pristina\r\nairport. Yugoslavia looks upon the developing East-West choreography\r\nwith a profound lack of interest. The Serb forces are withdrawing\r\ntogether with tens of thousands of Serb civilians, the new refugees in\r\nthis never-ending saga. This, despite the FACT that Milosevic could\r\nhave dragged the war on indefinitely without incurring too much damage\r\neither to his military or to his regime. Had he done so, NATO would\r\nhave been the first to blink.\r\n\r\nWhy did Milosevic surrender? Why so suddenly and so surprisingly? Why\r\ndid he surrender when the West and NATO were on the verge of breaking\r\napart (recall the acrimonious public exchanges between Blair, Clinton\r\nand Schroeder just prior to the auspicious Serb capitulation)? This is\r\nvery reminiscent of the German surrender in 1918. The forces in the\r\nfield felt victorious. The politicians wavered. The result was a sense\r\nof betrayal and backstabbing exploited by the corporal-Fuhrer Hitler.\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes used to say: \"When you eliminate the impossible, what\r\nremains, however improbable, must be the truth.\" And what remains is a\r\nsecret deal. A hidden agenda. A missing protocol. It is a wild\r\nreconstruction of bizarre events. It is improbable. But Milosevic's\r\nsurrender was impossible - so it must be the truth or a close\r\napproximation thereof.\r\n\r\nI think that the only reasonable explanation to this week's events is\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\nMilosevic agreed to withdraw from Kosovo and to turn it over to NATO\r\nfor a limited period of time.\r\n\r\nNATO (not too eager to remain in the province and police it forever)\r\nagreed to disarm the KLA and transform it into a docile police force\r\ncum political party. It agreed, in other words, to do Milosevic's\r\nbidding and dirty work.\r\n\r\nThe KLA agreed not to pursue its anti-Serb, pro-independence strategy.\r\nComing from Rugova, such a policy would have been judged treasonable.\r\nThe KLA was the only force, which could have delivered the climbdown.\r\n\r\nSerbia agreed to recognize the KLA as THE legitimate force in Kosovo\r\nonce demilitarised and converted. It actually agreed to support the KLA\r\nagainst the now discarded Rugova. The KLA needed Serbia, a natural ally\r\nin the absence of others.\r\n\r\nThe KLA and NATO agreed to let Serbia back into a KLA-dominated Kosovo\r\nlater. The exact form of the final political-military arrangement has\r\nnot been made clear. But it always was evident that it must - and will\r\n- include Serb sovereignty and military presence in the province.\r\nKosovo's political future remained undetermined: a province? An\r\nautonomy? In a federation? A confederation with Serbia and a more\r\nindependent Montenegro? No one knows, not even the main players. But\r\nthe Serbs and the KLA and NATO are in cahoots. There is more to the\r\n\"capitulation\" than meets the eye.\r\n\r\nMacedonia - informed about these backstage accords - hurried to\r\nestablish good neighbourly relations with the real winners of the war:\r\nwith the KLA. In this it served as both Serbia's AND NATO's long arm. A\r\nperfect venue and communication channel, Macedonia established itself\r\nas the arena of future reconstruction and future political\r\nnegotiations. Incidentally, it also secured its own territorial\r\nintegrity. A happy KLA in a self-governed Kosovo will have little\r\nincentive to re-engage in subversive activities in Albanian-populated\r\nWestern Macedonia.\r\n\r\nAll the participants in this tragicomedy are now going through the\r\nmotions. The Serbs are withdrawing. The KLA is taking over. NATO\r\nhalf-heartedly tries to disarm the more flagrant KLA units. Serbia is\r\nbiding its time. In a few months, it will be asked to re-enter Kosovo\r\nby both NATO and the KLA. A political phase will then begin which will\r\nresult in final status negotiations. Macedonia will host, convey\r\nmessages between the parties, apply pressure together with Albania and\r\nits own Albanian politicians, make promises, hold secretive meetings,\r\nand diplomatically gesticulate. If all goes well - everyone will emerge\r\nvictorious. If not - all the parties are steeling themselves for a\r\nsecond Kosovo war, much more inevitable than the first one.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Article published June 21, 1999 in \"The New Presence\")\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Deadly Antlers\r\n\r\n\r\nNATO, the EU and the New Kids on the Block\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Irish elk roamed the earth 10,000 years ago. They had the largest\r\npair of antlers ever grown - 3.6 meters (12 feet) across. Every year\r\nthey grew new antlers from nubs prominently displayed on their heads.\r\nThey were awesome to behold. They fought ferociously. They seemed\r\neternal.\r\n\r\nThen the weather changed. The earth shed its forests for new Tundra\r\nattire. The Irish elk ignored this creeping revolution. It continued to\r\ngrow its antlers and, by doing so, to deplete its own reserves of\r\ncalcium and phosphorus. Drained of vital minerals, unable to find\r\nenough food to restore themselves they died out, their magnificent\r\nantlers intact.\r\n\r\nNATO has emerged from its Pyrrhic victory in Kosovo shell shocked and\r\nriven by internal strains. The European Union (EU), in the name of\r\n\"Euro-Atlantic Structures\", hurries to join NATO in the minefield it so\r\nunwisely occupies. Both are in danger of growing antlers too big for\r\ntheir own survival. There are three pairs of lethal antlers involved:\r\n\r\na. Europe and Uncle Sam\r\n\r\nThe misnomered Operation Allied Force employed little force (much less\r\nthan during the Gulf War) and tore the alliance apart. NATO has split\r\ninto a nascent European military structure (the former defunct West\r\nEuropean Union which was officially absorbed by the EU a fortnight ago)\r\n- and an American (rather, an Anglo-Saxon) avuncularly benevolent\r\numbrella. Europeans have yet to recover from the detached, callous and\r\noff-handed manner of the mismanagement of the whole crisis by the\r\namateurs in Washington. Their trust in America's insight, foresight and\r\nsagacious hindsight has been shattered by American strategic mistakes,\r\nintelligence errors, diplomatic gaffes and internal squabbling in a\r\npoll-orientated administration. The Europeans emerged with a \"never\r\nagain\" pledge. America is not likely to be invited to Europe's parties\r\nany time soon. Europe is too much of a China shop and America - whether\r\nRepublican or Democratic - too much of an elephant. As it were, there\r\nwas no love wasted between these two constituents of NATO. Now they are\r\neffectively divorcing or, at least, going through a phase of not so\r\namicable separation.\r\n\r\nTo this one should add the conflicting interests of members in this\r\nuncomfortable ménage a 19. Greece (aided and abetted by Iran) is\r\nalready fighting proxy wars with Turkey throughout Central Eastern Asia\r\n(the Asian Republics of the former USSR), in Cyprus and in the former\r\nYugoslavia. France is uneasy with the German-British Third Way and what\r\nit regards as a rapprochement between the two, which threatens its\r\nprivileged status in the EU. The poorer countries and the EU regional\r\naid beneficiaries (not always the same group) are dead set against EU\r\nenlargement to the east. The list is very long.\r\n\r\nb. Central Europe\r\n\r\nDisgusted by what they regarded as a superfluous and unnecessarily\r\nbrutal war - the Central Europeans had the rudest awakening imaginable.\r\nThey were forced to participate in a war effort within what they\r\nbelieved to be a defensive alliance. They joined NATO the introverted\r\ngiant - and woke up to NATO the agile, hyperactive and violent\r\nneighbourhood cop. Hungary was forced to risk its ethnic kinfolk in\r\nSerbia's Vojvodina region. The Czechs engaged in bruising internal\r\nverbal fistfights. It was not a seemly sight. The new Central European\r\nentrants joined the likes of Greece and Italy and recoiled from\r\nassisting the war effort in any meaningful way. The shock waves are\r\nlikely to reverberate for longer and transform NATO's commitment in\r\nCentral Europe. It is not inconceivable to end up with a two-tier NATO:\r\nthe fighting goons and the battle-shy, logistics-only allies.\r\n\r\nThis uneasy co-existence is made even less cosy by the clear reluctance\r\nof the EU to absorb the poor relatives to its east and south. Entry\r\ndeadlines are habitually postponed, bureaucratic hurdles gleefully\r\npresented, sadistic reports about the Central Europeans' lack of\r\nprogress periodically issued. No wonder the six eternal candidates feel\r\nrejected and abused. This humiliating misbehaviour on the part of the\r\nEU resulted in a turning of the tide. Opinion polls show growing\r\nopposition to the idea of Europe (in the Czech Republic, for instance)\r\n- unthinkable just two years ago. The countries of the Balkan area -\r\nthe \"New Associates\" - constitute ominous competition for funds,\r\nattention and orientation, as far as the current future members are\r\nconcerned. The Lucky Six (the Visegrad Trio, Slovenia, Cyprus) are\r\nlikely to be relegated to the backburner now that the EU found a new\r\ntoy, the Balkans. This will engender great bitterness and enmity\r\nbetween the EU and Central Europe and between Central Europe and the\r\nBalkanians. Hardly a recipe for orderly transition, for democracy, or\r\nfor market economy.\r\n\r\nc. The Balkan Sore\r\n\r\nThe EU is known for its verbal pyrotechnics, its unlimited pool of\r\nenticing vision and its great spinning and marketing techniques. This\r\narsenal is fully employed now to bedazzle the Balkan natives into happy\r\nsubmission to the seductive harmonies of the common market. The EU is\r\ndangling a cornucopian promise of eternal economic bliss in front of\r\nthe bleeding, limb-torn statal rumps, which comprise the former glory\r\nof Yugoslavia. But the targets of this brainwashing will do well to\r\nlook to their Central European neighbours for an antidote. The \"New\r\nAssociation\" status offered to the likes of Macedonia, Albania,\r\nBulgaria and Romania and, later, Montenegro and perhaps, post-Milosevic\r\nSerbia is an ingenious piece of camouflage, a fata morgana, devoid of\r\ncontent. It is an evocation of hitherto repressed desires and it leads\r\nto self-delusion but it will amount to no serious attempt at\r\nintegration by the EU.\r\n\r\nThe economic disparity between the aspirants and the current members is\r\nnumbing. The average GDP per capita in Macedonia is c. 2000 USD per\r\nannum. This is the GDP produced by a Slovenian in 10 weeks, by a Greek\r\nand Portuguese in 8, by a German in 3 weeks. There is no convergence to\r\ntalk of - the gap is increasing, not decreasing, especially following\r\nthe Kosovo debacle. The legal system in these countries is biased\r\nagainst the individual, antiquated and totalitarian. Human and civil\r\nrights are foreign implants, inflammatorily rejected by the body\r\npolitic. The economy is corrupt, nepotistic and cronyist. Crime\r\norganizations constitute a big part of the trading activities and\r\nmaintain a heavy grip upon the political class. The media is mostly\r\ngovernment-owned and manipulated. The Balkan simply is not European. It\r\nis Byzantine, Ottoman, Eastern, and Orthodox. It belongs to Turkey and\r\nthe Middle East, not to Frankfurt and Paris. It is closer to Moscow\r\nthan to Leningrad. It will never be successfully subsumed by the West.\r\nTurkey has been trying for decades now and has been consistently (and\r\nperfunctorily) rejected by the EU. And Turkey is an important member of\r\nNATO and a country much more developed than the likes of Macedonia or\r\nAlbania.\r\n\r\nAs these unpleasant truths emerge, the bitterness, resentment and\r\ndisillusionment will grow and a backlash will develop. It might wear\r\nthe guise of internal strife, of isolationist policies, of wounded\r\nretreat, of terrorism - all weapons of the deceived and trampled upon\r\nunderdogs. It was wrong of the EU to promise what it can never deliver\r\nand couch it in deceptively ear soothing phrases. It will pay the price\r\nin added instability and ruin.\r\n\r\nThe Euro-Atlantic structures are evolving, assuming ever more ambitious\r\nand comprehensive goals, and growing ever more impressive antlers. They\r\nroam the whole earth, administering human rights and free marketry.\r\nThey impose their will. They are awesome to behold. But from within\r\nthey are being depleted and consumed by their very own incoherence. It\r\nis the eternal cycle of prowess and vanquishment. NATO, struggling to\r\nredefine itself and perpetuate its totally superfluous existence. The\r\nEU struggling to secure peaceful markets to its east and south. Europe\r\nstruggling to assert itself. The USA struggling to secure its\r\nsuperiority in an emerging multi-polar, multi-ethnic, fractured world.\r\nAll are fighting losing battles, wagging their antlers to and fro.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Article written on June 22, 1999 and published June 28, 1999\r\n\r\nin \"Central Europe Review\" volume 1, issue 1)\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Treasure Trove of Kosovo\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing like a juicy, photogenic human catastrophe to enrich corrupt\r\npoliticians and bottom-line-orientated, stock-option-motivated\r\ncorporate executives. The Balkan is teeming with both these sad days.\r\nEven as the war was raging, shortages of food and other supplies led to\r\nthe dispensation of political favours (in the form of import licences,\r\nfor instance) to the chosen few. Bulgarian, Greek and Albanian firms,\r\nowned by ruthless criminals and criminals-turned-politicians benefited\r\nmightily. Millions were made and shared as artificially high prices\r\nwere maintained by various means while cronies and crime controlled\r\nfirms shared the spoils. This orgiastic intercourse between the corrupt\r\nand the criminal was not confined to one country. The whole region\r\npartook in robbing the most impoverished populations in Europe by\r\n\"legal\" means.\r\n\r\nTheir more refined and perfumed Western brethren were never far behind\r\nin taking advantage of American largesse on the one hand and\r\nre-emerging alarmist tendencies, on the other. Thus, American, German,\r\nGreek, French and Italian firms enjoyed funds allocated to\r\ninternational humanitarian aid by the likes of the US government, the\r\nUnited Nations, the World Bank, the IMF and other long arms of the\r\nAmerican octopus. Defence contractors and the dubious characters known\r\nas weapons intermediaries stoked the atavistic fires of war in securing\r\ndefence contracts. And aid workers resided in six star hotels, driving\r\nthe latest sports utility vehicles and brandishing futuristic laptop\r\ncomputers as they went about the business of dispensing aid. In the\r\nmeantime, at least one half of all aid money was pilfered - not to use\r\na harsher term. Aid rations were freely available in Macedonian,\r\nAlbanian, Greek and Bulgarian markets - offered at a discount by aid\r\nworkers who stole them from their supposed recipients. The refugees\r\nwere never given mattresses, were short of blankets, water, showers and\r\ntoilets (I visited the camps - this is an eyewitness account). Only\r\nbread was abundant.\r\n\r\nNow that the war is over, some people are counting their dead - while\r\nothers are counting their blessings. But this has all been a prelude.\r\nIt is the next wave of aid, which is the main course in this\r\nbacchanalia. Outlandishly feverish numbers are tossed around. Kosovo's\r\nimmediate reconstruction (housing and infrastructure) will require well\r\nover 2 billion US dollars in the next 2 years. Of this, 1.5 billion\r\ndollars has already been raised. A further 2 billion USD is slated as\r\ndirect aid to the shattered economies of Macedonia and Albania. But the\r\nreal booty lies in Serbia. A minimum of 10-13 billion dollars will be\r\nrequired simply to restore Serbia's infrastructure to its former,\r\ninglorious self. To resuscitate the whole languishing area, a\r\nstaggering 30 billion dollars is touted as the minimal bill.\r\n\r\nRest assured that at least one third of this generous cornucopia would\r\nend up lining the pockets of the rich and mighty. At least 1 billion\r\ndollars will end up festering in Swiss, Cypriot, South African and\r\nIsraeli bank accounts. The politicians know it, the \"grupirovki\"\r\n(business cartels controlled by mafia-style organizations) know it, and\r\nWestern governments know it. This is the REAL stability pact.\r\nFinancially inebriated politicians are better motivated to maintain\r\npeace and stability, or so the thinking goes.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Balkans will play a major role in determining the\r\ntopography and geography of this flood of cronyism, nepotism,\r\ncriminality and vice. The Balkan is composed of states run by crime\r\norganizations and crime organizations run by states. Old alliances last\r\nlong (as opposed to the Middle East where alliances, dune-like, shift\r\nwith the winds). Bulgaria and Macedonia, for instance. Serbia and\r\nGreece. Albania and Kosovo. And now Albania and Macedonia. Meetings of\r\nregional \"leaders\" in the Balkans were always reminiscent of scenes\r\nfrom \"The Godfather\". The dons, uncomfortably clad in expensive\r\nbusiness suits and wearing golden rings, deciding life and death and a\r\njovial yet vaguely menacing atmosphere. Only the leaders of the New\r\nBalkans are much younger, less experienced, more prone to superstition,\r\nextremism and moodiness. The old tensions are bound to re-emerge, this\r\ntime in the employ of business interests. Expect a flare up of\r\nanimosity between Greece and Macedonia. Despite its Bulgarophile\r\nregime, expect uneasy moments between Bulgaria and Macedonia. And\r\nexpect an unholy alliance of business interests between Mr. Thaci and\r\nhis sprawling business empire and the governments of Albania and\r\nMacedonia. If not assassinated before, Thaci is definitely the Man to\r\nwatch. Young, well educated, ruthless, involved in business (read:\r\ncorrupt to the core) - an aptly dangerous man in dangerous times.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that everyone holds high expectations. This is a poor\r\nrecipe for an amicable carving of the cake of international funding.\r\nMacedonia expects to lead the reconstruction effort of Kosovo. It was\r\noffended greatly by the decision to base the Kosovo reconstruction\r\nagency in Pristina. Greek and Italian firms expect to snatch profits\r\nout of the jaws of their near treacherous behaviour during the war.\r\nTurkish firms except to be rewarded for the loyalty of Turkey during\r\nthe same. American and German firms expect to exclude all else in\r\ngaining access to American and German (=EU) funds (as they have done in\r\nBosnia). These all are mutually incompatible expectations and they will\r\nlead to mutually exclusive behaviour. Expect some very ugly scenes,\r\nincluding spilt doses of this cheap, red liquid, blood.\r\n\r\nAlbania, already governed by the ungovernable crime gangs it spawned in\r\nthe last few years, has formed an alliance with the KLA, never a moral\r\nstandard-bearer. This expanded amusement park of drug trafficking,\r\nprostitution, weapons smuggling, contraband and much worse is now\r\nthreatening to take over its more virtuous (though by no means\r\nvirginal) neighbour, Macedonia. A flare up of hitherto unimaginable\r\nbrotherly love has indicated this sacrilegious rapprochement. The\r\nMacedonian Prime Minister - encumbered by a demanding Albanian\r\ncoalition partner - has met Thaci and the encounter had all the\r\ntrappings of a state visit. Soon after senior Albanian politicians\r\nstarted talking about a Macedonian recognition of an independent state\r\nof Kosovo and an Albanian language university (the reason for student\r\nriots just two years before).\r\n\r\nTo a large extent, the Kosovo war was gang warfare. The Serb criminal\r\norganization known as Yugoslavia against the Albanian gang known as the\r\nKLA. It was a war over turf and lucrative businesses. In what used to\r\nbe the Third World and more so in the post-communist countries in\r\ntransition, criminal activities often accompany \"wars of liberation\".\r\nIn Congo, in Sierra Leone, in Chechnya, in Kashmir - wars are as much\r\nabout diamonds, oil and opium poppies as about national aspirations.\r\nKosovo is no exception but it was here that the West was duped into\r\nintervention. NATO was called upon to arbiter between two crime gangs.\r\nThere is no end to the mischievous irony of history.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the following incidents are more telling than any learned\r\nanalysis:\r\n\r\nIn late April, the Albanian telecom switched off the roaming facility\r\nof cell phones in Albania. Foreigners - including aid workers - had to\r\npay the company 1000 dollars for a special roaming-enabled chip.\r\n\r\nRumour has it that the post of the Chief of Police in the Tirana\r\nAirport was \"sold\" at the beginning of April for an undisclosed amount\r\n(presumably 250,000 US dollars). The reasons: all shippers (including\r\nNATO and aid organizations) have to pay enormous kickbacks to airport\r\nand customs officials to release their goods.\r\n\r\nMost Albanian families charged refugee families an average of 500 DM a\r\nmonth for their accommodation in subhuman conditions. Refugees who\r\ncould not pay (or who had no relatives in Germany and Switzerland to\r\npay for them) were evicted, often cruelly.\r\n\r\nAs Serbs were murdering their supposed brothers in Kosovo, Albanian\r\ncrime gangs laid an oil pipeline (through Lake Shkoder) to Serbia and\r\nsupplied the Serb army with the oil it was deprived of by NATO.\r\n\r\nWelcome to the Balkans.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Article written on June 27, 1999 and published July 5, 1999\r\n\r\nin \"Central Europe Review\" volume 1, issue 2)\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLucky Macedonia or Macedonia's Serendipity\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Good Fortune of Neighbouring a Human Catastrophe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn October 1998, the unreformed communists of the SDSM - the Socialists\r\n- lost the elections in Macedonia by a wide margin to an improbable\r\ncoalition. It consisted of the VMRO - fervent nationalists with\r\nBulgarian roots, headed by the poet-politician Ljubco Georgievski - and\r\nthe Democratic alternative (DA). The latter was a hastily assembled\r\nparty headed by Vasil Tupurkovski, a pro-US former member of the old\r\nYugoslav nomenclature. DA enjoyed grassroots support especially by\r\nyoung professionals, businessmen and liberals. It imported Western\r\ncampaigning techniques and made bold promises to revitalize and\r\nenergize the economy.\r\n\r\nWhen the news of the unequivocal victory of the VMRO-DA coalition\r\narrived, the nation was swept by an unprecedented wave of enthusiasm,\r\noptimism and joy. Unprecedented because the young nation's history (its\r\nindependence was declared in 1991) provided it with very little reason\r\nto be joyful. Its main trading partners were either boycotted by the\r\nworld (the rump Yugoslavia) or themselves boycotted Macedonia - Greece\r\nin the wake of outlandish dispute regarding Macedonia's official name\r\n(hence the impossible FYROM) and Bulgaria because it refused to allow\r\nthe use of the Macedonian language in bilateral documents. The economy\r\ncollapsed, unemployment soared, investment all but vanished, corruption\r\nerupted and the Albanian ethnic minority became restive.\r\n\r\nMacedonia was laid to economic waste by powers beyond its control. Its\r\nentrepreneurial inhabitants - fresh from 500 years of Ottoman training\r\nfollowed by 50 years of communism - resorted to smuggling (from Greece\r\nto Serbia through the Vardar river) and established a reasonably\r\nfunctioning underground economy. The IMF and the Central Bank\r\nmaintained macro-economic stability (following years of hyperinflation)\r\nat an excruciating social cost. Trade was liberalized, inflation tamed,\r\nthe currency was made freely convertible and the exchange rate eerily\r\nsustained (rather, suspended).\r\n\r\nBut under-currents seethed below the tattered facade. Disenchantment\r\nwith the ruling classes and their mafia-like structure increased\r\ndramatically. Intricate webs of village and family loyalties were\r\ntested to the limit in affairs such as TAT, the collapse of a savings\r\nbank in a pyramid scheme in which some top level officials were\r\nimplicated. Cronyism and nepotism led to the legalized robbery of the\r\nassets of the state through bogus privatisation schemes. Some people\r\ngrew exceedingly rich - others became inordinately poor. The tension\r\nwas palpable. The youth felt trapped, facing a dead end future. Many\r\nemigrated.\r\n\r\nAlbanian nationalism was introduced into this explosive vapour in\r\n1997-8. It existed long before (the KLA, for instance, became a force\r\nto reckoned with as early as 1993). It constituted the main concern of\r\nthe ethnic Macedonians (of Slav extract). People spoke ominously of an\r\nArmageddon to be waged between the two ethnicities.\r\n\r\nThe two communities exist separately. There are no inter-marriages,\r\nvery few common business ventures and the Albanians either live in\r\nghettos within the main cities - or in Albanian dominated cities of\r\ntheir own (such as Gostivar and Tetovo) in western Macedonia, across\r\nthe border from Kosovo. The ground was shaking long before 1997. The\r\nmutual hatred, loathing and, above all, fear of domination and cultural\r\nsubjugation were real and under a very thin veneer of civility. The\r\ninclusion of a national Albanian party (there are three) in the\r\ngovernment was greeted as a welcome omen and respite. But this was not\r\nto be.\r\n\r\nThe ethnic Macedonian's main fear is that the Albanians are aiming to\r\nrecreate a \"Greater Albania\" comprising the current Albania, Kosova and\r\nWestern Macedonia. A natural Islamic axis (Albania-Bosnia-Central Asia)\r\nwould then form and threaten the Slav peoples wherever they are (Serbs,\r\nRussians, Bulgarians). What started as the normal friction between two\r\nethnic groups in close physical proximity ended as a mythical\r\nre-enactment of the Islamic (Ottoman) invasion of Europe in the 14th\r\ncentury. A nightmare revived fraught with the fears of an economically\r\nlanguishing Christian-Orthodox, Slav, Byzantine civilization. A very\r\nconcrete issue of land and autonomy assumed the dimensions of a cosmic\r\nclash between the titans of religion.\r\n\r\nOfficially, the Albanians constitute 23% of the population in\r\nMacedonia. But Albanian did not take well to what they regarded as\r\ncoercion: the population census. They refused to be counted and evaded\r\nthe census takers - to their great detriment. As a result, their\r\nnumbers are severely understated. It is safe to say that well over ONE\r\nTHIRD of the population was of Albanian origin long BEFORE the wave of\r\nrefugees swept over this 25,000 square kilometres country. Should one\r\nthird of the refugees be absorbed by Macedonia - another 80,000\r\nAlbanians - the Albanian population stands to constitute more than 40%\r\nof the population. The Albanians marry younger, have double the number\r\nof children of the ethnic Macedonian (it is a much younger population)\r\nand almost never divorce. Their families are very cohesive and tend to\r\nstick together geographically. In the year 2015 - the majority of the\r\npopulation in Macedonia will be of Albanian origin, if this trend\r\ncontinues unperturbed and one third of the refugees remain. In 1912\r\nKosovo had a sizeable Serb majority. In 1972 this was no longer true.\r\n\r\nThe ethnic Macedonians are appalled by this demography. They are\r\nscared. They do not believe that they can co-exist with the Albanians.\r\nStereotypes abound: the Albanians are backward, criminal elements,\r\nilliterate, violent and expansive, say the Macedonians. And their main\r\ngoal in life - for which no sacrifice is too great - is to seize land\r\nfrom their neighbours. Kosova is a first step - the Macedonians are\r\nconvinced - Western Macedonia is next, a civil war is imminent.\r\n\r\nMarginal efforts at reconciliation aside - the Albanians themselves did\r\nnot make any special effort to assuage the fears of the Macedonians.\r\nQuite the contrary. Radical, young and nationalistic leaders abound.\r\nRufi Osmani, the former Mayor of Gostivar, was jailed for his\r\nactivities and pardoned by the President after the new government\r\nthreatened a constitutional crisis. He and his associates demanded the\r\nright to use Albanian in official transactions with state and municipal\r\ninstitutions - which is a reasonable demand. But they also demanded the\r\nright to hoist the Albanian flag and sing the Albanian anthem rather\r\nthan the Macedonian one. Then they disobeyed the rulings of the Supreme\r\nCourt and instigated violent clashes with the Police (which resulted in\r\ndeaths). The establishment of a Tetovo \"university\" in the Albanian\r\nlanguage did not help matters much. Regarded by Macedonian as a hotbed\r\nof much nationalism but little learning - the Macedonians refused to\r\naccredit it. Riots and counter-riots ensued, culminating in violent\r\ndemonstrations of Macedonian students in the streets of Skopje, the\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\nThe average salary in Macedonia is 200 Euro (=180 US dollars) a MONTH.\r\nThere are c. 300,000 unemployed in a total working age population of\r\n930,000. There is a constant balance of payments deficit of 8% of GNP.\r\nMacedonia is POOR - real poor, not relatively poor. It is poorer than\r\nany other country in Europe, with the exception of Albania. It is also\r\ninsecure. Albanians and Serbs from within and from without threaten its\r\nvery existence. It would do wisely to remain on good terms with\r\nYugoslavia - not only because 50% of its trade is conducted with it -\r\nbut also because Yugoslavia is THE big neighbour of the north. Long\r\nafter Clinton is gone and perhaps NATO in its current form as well -\r\nMacedonia will have to deal with its perceived betrayal of Serbia.\r\nSerbs never forget and rarely forgive. They visit the sins of the\r\nbattle of Kosovo (1389) upon other Moslems - 610 years later, in the\r\nsame location. They are a dangerous, tenacious, resilient, ruthless and\r\nunrelenting foe to have. Macedonia is so small and helpless (no army to\r\nspeak of) that it is terrified and caught between the NATO rock and the\r\nSerbian hard place. It feels blackmailed, used and exploited without\r\nreal regard to its problems now and after the war is over. NATO showed\r\nits real face when it placed Macedonia (with Albania) in the last\r\ncategory of NATO applicants. Macedonia is a military base to NATO -\r\nhere today, gone tomorrow. Who will protect Macedonia from Yugoslavia\r\nwhen the foreign media circus is engaged elsewhere? This is the age of\r\nthe soundbite and the videoclip. It is the generation of expediency.\r\nMacedonia can - and will - easily be forgotten. Hence its refusal to\r\nallow ground warfare from its soil (a position shared by many,\r\nincluding, for instance, Hungary, a NATO member, with less to lose than\r\nMacedonia).\r\n\r\nAnd this is where Macedonia made a mistake. It did not manage its\r\npublic relations properly. It absorbed as many refugees as Albania (10%\r\nof the population - the equivalent of 25 million Mexican refugees in\r\nthe USA) and treated its refugees with reasonable decency - under\r\nhellishly impossible circumstances. The USA and the EU reneged on all\r\ntheir commitments: financial as well as humanitarian. It costs\r\nMacedonia (UNHCR figures) c. 300,000 US dollars a day in direct\r\nexpenses to host the human outcome of the NATO blunder. That's\r\n15,000,000 US dollars in direct costs since the war started - or almost\r\n1% of the GDP. Add to this a drop of 50% in exports and 26% in\r\nindustrial production and the costs are already at least 10-15% of the\r\nGDP. These are surreal, mind-boggling numbers. It is the equivalent of\r\nthe Great Depression in the USA.\r\n\r\nMacedonia received hitherto 3 million US dollars (2 from Taiwan and 1\r\nfrom UNHCR after a LOT of pressure). Oh, I forgot: and a gigantic pile\r\nof promises - to reschedule debts by one year (not to write them off,\r\nwhich would have constituted real help). The West lies through its\r\nteeth and when exposed it wags a moral finger at this poor, crumbling,\r\nneophyte of a country. It is a disgrace of unprecedented proportions.\r\n\r\nAlbania behaved more slickly - perhaps because its government is more\r\nveteran and perhaps because it really empathized more heartily with its\r\nsuffering kin. They made the right noises and posed to the camera using\r\nthe right, complimentary, angles. It won much more help than Macedonia\r\nand is universally accoladed by the West.\r\n\r\nThis is what Macedonia SHOULD have done. Open its borders in a great\r\ndisplay of camaraderie and human passion. Wine and dine the bored,\r\nfrustrated journalists on its turf, pose for the cameras, hair\r\ndishevelled, Tony Blair-like. Instead its leadership went about the\r\nbusiness of absorbing a human wave of unheard of proportions while, at\r\nthe same time, trying to defuse tensions from within and from without.\r\nNo one informed them that in today's world it matters not what one does\r\n- as what one is SEEN to be doing. This is the vital lesson. Albania\r\nwill rebuild its future on the back of the serendipitous refugees of\r\nKosovo. Macedonia will pay the price of its lack of savvy.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Article published July 26, 1999 in \"Central Europe Review\"\r\n\r\nvolume 1, issue 5)\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBlack Magic, White Magic\r\n\r\n\r\nManaging our Future\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn address given to the Council of the VMRO-DPMNE, Macedonia's ruling\r\nparty, chaired by Minister of Defence and Former Prime Minister of the\r\nRepublic of Macedonia, Mr. Nikola Kljusev on July 16, 1999\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGermany's economy collapsed following a reparations agreement, which\r\nsapped and consumed less than 10% of its GDP. America's economy\r\ncollapsed, its unemployment soared, its stock exchange vanished and it\r\nentered a deflationary cycle, which necessitated the most pervasive\r\nfederal intervention in its history - mainly because of multilateral\r\ntrade restrictions.\r\n\r\nMacedonia has endured trade embargoes, international isolation, wars,\r\nand an influx of refugees - and still survives as an intact,\r\nfunctioning economy. There is no civil war, no hyperinflation, a stable\r\ncurrency and no famine. It is nothing less than a miracle. No textbook\r\neconomist would have predicted this outcome.\r\n\r\nBut Macedonia is trying to cope with its predicament in wrong ways. It\r\nis trying to change other countries, or to force or convince them to\r\nchange their policies, or to engage in \"Voodoo Economics\". An economy\r\ncannot be run on the bases of promises, contingencies, gifts, aid and a\r\nLotaria na Makedonija approach. Economic policy must not be based on\r\nthe usual but rather on the normal. In politics, most magic is black\r\nand mostly bad things tend to happen. Macedonia is situated in an\r\naccident-prone area. It cannot and need not pretend (as Slovenia more\r\nsuccessfully and Croatia with less success do) that it is part of\r\nWestern Europe. This denial of the painful truth - that we are at the\r\nmercy of forces beyond our control in a region resembling a mental\r\nasylum - is at the root of our economic malaise. What if Montenegro\r\nerupts tomorrow?\r\n\r\nMacedonia cannot change other countries, nor can it influence them to\r\nchange their policies. It is too small and insignificant and it has no\r\npolicy options. Will it really deny NATO next time around if it does\r\nnot receive the compensation it requested from it? Will the nature of\r\nits relationship with the EU change if the EU will not honour its\r\npromises and obligations? Macedonia is constrained to a very limited\r\nset of diplomatic and economic choices.\r\n\r\nInstead of changing others - we must change ourselves. We must force\r\nMacedonians to change and let ourselves be convinced to change our\r\npolicies. We must, in other words, introduce magic - the magic of\r\ntrust. Trust in our banks will encourage domestic savings and domestic\r\ninvestments. It will draw out 1-2 billion dollars from under mattresses\r\nand into deposits. This amount is equal to 5 years of aid or FDI\r\n(foreign direct investment). Trust in our courts will attract foreign\r\ninvestments. Trust in our government will end the current civil\r\ndisobedience. Our citizens are rebellious. They don't pay their taxes,\r\nthey do not collaborate with their own government. They don't trust it\r\nto do the good and the right thing.\r\n\r\nMacedonia is not perceived by the Europeans to be European. It is too\r\npoor to become a member of the EU, public relations exercises (the\r\nstability and Growth Pact) notwithstanding. It is too needy and donor\r\nweariness is setting in. Money will be harder and harder to come by.\r\nAnd our products compete head on with European products protected and\r\npromoted by the strongest lobbies in Brussels.\r\n\r\nAnd with these FACTS we have to live. A sound, prosperous economy is\r\nthe result of minute, mundane, routine and boring activities - not the\r\nresult of rabbits pulled out of a hat. Even if the rabbits are European.\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Friendly Club\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCyprus, that beacon of political stability and financial rectitude, was\r\ninvited to negotiate its membership. Bulgaria, the epitome of good\r\ngovernance and civil society as well as Malta the undisputed friend of\r\nthe West (remember Qaddafi?) - were among the list of new candidates\r\nhanded down in the Helsinki meet of the most desired economic club on\r\nearth: the EU. To these were added Romania and its collapsing economy.\r\nMacedonia was relegated to the \"West Balkan\" group - a revolutionary\r\nre-definition of historical affiliations. In this assemblage, it found\r\nitself rubbing shoulders with the disintegrating Albania and the pariah\r\nYugoslavia. Croatia was ejected from this leper colony by virtue of the\r\ndeath of its megalomaniac autocrat and his replacement by ex-communists.\r\n\r\nThings have been very different only a few months ago, when the EU and\r\nNATO needed the good and naive services of Macedonia. It was a honeyed\r\ncourtship. Macedonia was then virtually besieged by a flood of\r\nworld-class politicians, all eager to make the acquaintance of the\r\ncharming political class of the Balkans. Promises were doled out with\r\nabandon. Blair promised tens of millions. Clinton topped this by\r\npledging hundreds of millions. And the grateful West offered billions.\r\nIn the meantime, Macedonia's infrastructure was pulverized by heavy\r\narmour and light-footed refugees - a quarter of a million of them.\r\n\r\nThe people of the Balkans are the off spring of broken promises. Their\r\nvillage shrewdness (which is not to be confused with worldly\r\nsophistication) predisposed them not to trust the kindness of\r\nstrangers. Their in-bred paranoia led them to attribute prophetic\r\nforesight, sharp planning and intricate conspiracy to what were mere\r\nstumbling and bumbling on the part of the West and its mighty NATO. The\r\ndisillusionment came fast and painlessly. To live in fantasy is often\r\nmore rewarding than to have it fulfilled and many Macedonians were\r\ngrateful for the intermission in their hundred years of solitude. The\r\nhangover, the bitter aftertaste, the sore muscles of the morning after\r\n- the Macedonians accepted all these with unusual grace.\r\n\r\nBut as insults were added to injuries, a sense of betrayal evolved.\r\nThey felt exploited and discarded, objectified and dehumanised by\r\nsuper-powers of mythical proportions. They felt abused and deceived.\r\nUsed to getting the short end of every stick - this time there was no\r\nstick at all. Having been thus manipulated and largely unable to direct\r\ntheir anger at the veritable sources of their frustration - they turned\r\nupon themselves in internecine squabbling, disgraced and flouted. This\r\nwas further exacerbated by incessant preaching and hectoring of the\r\nrepresentatives of those powers, which thus forsake them. By the very\r\npeople who reneged on promises. By countries and politicians whose own\r\ndomestic politics and personal conduct were an object and abject lesson\r\nnot to be emulated. Countries imbued with corruption preached to the\r\nMacedonians about good governance. Countries which suppressed their\r\nminorities in bloody campaigns reprimanded Macedonia for its treatment\r\nof its own minorities. Countries, which sold weapons to every\r\ndespicable dictator in every corner of the earth - prevented Macedonia\r\nfrom trading with its neighbours.\r\n\r\nOf the money promised - very little materialized. The blazing trail of\r\nWest European and American movie stars and presidents became a trickle\r\nof East European politicians and Brussels bureaucrats. Membership\r\nbecame association, association became new association and new\r\nassociation went nowhere as dates were postponed and dates kept were\r\nused as photo-opportunities by synthetic Western leaders.\r\n\r\nIf anyone should have been invited to join the EU it is poor Macedonia.\r\nPoor - but not as poor as Romania, for instance. Any comparison of the\r\ntwo bespeaks volumes about the West's betrayal. Romania's official\r\ninflation is 40% - Macedonia's is around 1% and has been, on average,\r\nless than 3% in the last 3 years. Romania's depleted GDP is collapsing.\r\nMacedonia has survived the Kosovo crisis with its GDP intact and is\r\npoised to grow by 4-6% in the year 2000 according to the IMF. Romania's\r\naverage wage is less than 90 dollars a month - Macedonia's is 160 US\r\ndollars. The lei is as unstable as Yugoslavia's denar was prior to the\r\nKosovo crisis - Macedonia's currency held stable throughout the\r\nexternal shock-ridden last three years and is trusted by its citizens.\r\nRomania's governments change frequently and with little reason, often\r\nsuccumbing to the wishes of an ominously violent street. Macedonia's\r\ngovernment has changed once in the last 5 years and that following a\r\nfair and democratic election. Admittedly, Romania's market is much\r\nbigger than Macedonia's and its location closer to the EU. But\r\nMacedonia is an important bridgehead to the Balkans and beyond (Turkey)\r\nand its web of trading agreements and arrangements makes it a virtual\r\nmarket of more than 110 million people.\r\n\r\nBut Macedonia is friendless in the EU. It has no patron saint, no\r\nGermany (Croatia, Czech Republic), no France (Romania), no Greece\r\n(Cyprus). It is too small to fear and small enough to ignore\r\ncomfortably. It is a peaceful and docile nation. It is co-operative. It\r\nis trustworthy and has proven its devotion to the idea of the West in\r\ntimes good and bad, mainly the latter. Perhaps these qualities\r\ndisqualified it. Perhaps being taken for granted does not grant being\r\ntaken. Whatever the explanation, the people of this tiny country grieve\r\nthis short romance, so fleeting, so sweet, so dreamy and, as they are\r\nfinding now, so surreal.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Article written on January 15, 2000 and published February 7, 2000\r\n\r\nin \"Central Europe Review\" volume 2, issue 5)\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Books of the Damned\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I have gone into the outer darkness of scientific and philosophical\r\ntransactions and proceedings, ultra-respectable, but covered with the\r\ndust of disregard.

What we have is a limitation on what\r\nnewspapers can report.\"\r\n\r\n(Louis Nel, Deputy Minister of Information, South Africa)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the country of ex-Nazi officer Kurt Waldheim and current\r\nNazi-sympathizer Jorg Haider, the xenophobic and anti-Semitic offering\r\nof local media come as little surprise. Austria, after all, contributed\r\ndisproportionately to the Nazi death machine. But what seems to be a\r\nunique Austrian phenomenon is not. The media outlets in Central,\r\nEastern and Southern Europe are easily interchangeable. In the same\r\nweek of Austrian derision and paranoia, \"Start\", a trash weekly in\r\nMacedonia attacked the British Ambassador and the Americans for\r\nconspiring to dismantle Macedonia with the collaboration of its local,\r\ndisloyal and haughty Albanian minority.\r\n\r\nThe media in the countries in transition is taxonomically not\r\ndissimilar to its brethren in the West. It, too, can be divided to five\r\ncategories of ownership and agenda. What sets it apart, though, is its\r\nlack of (even feigned) professionalism, its venality and its tainted\r\nulterior motives. I wrote about it elsewhere, in \"The Rip van Winkle\r\nInstitutions\":\r\n\r\n\"And then there is the media - the waste basket of post communist\r\nsocieties, the cesspool of influence peddling and calumny. Journalists\r\nare easily bought and sold and their price is ever decreasing. They\r\nwork in mouthpieces of business interests masquerading as newspapers or\r\nelectronic media. They receive their instructions - to lie, to falsify,\r\nto ignore, to emphasize, to suppress, to extort, to inform, to\r\ncollaborate with the authorities - from their Editor in Chief. They\r\ntrade news for advertising. Some of them are involved in all manner of\r\ncriminal activities, others are simply unethical in the extreme. They\r\nall have pacts with Mammon. People do not believe a word these\r\ncontortionists of language and torturers of meaning write or say. It is\r\nby comparing these tampered and biased sources that people reach their\r\nown conclusions within their private medium.\"\r\n\r\nThe commercial media - the likes on \"Nova\" TV in the Czech Republic -\r\nare poor people's imitations of the more visible aspects of American\r\nmass culture. Overflowing with lowbrow talk shows, freaks on display,\r\nmalicious gossip which passes for \"news\" and glitzy promos and quizzes\r\n- these TV stations and print magazines derive the bulk of their income\r\nfrom advertising. While ostensibly politically innocuous, they exert a\r\nsubtle and cumulative influence on the numbed and dwindling minds of\r\ntheir spectators and readers. By conditioning their consumers to ever\r\nlower fare of pulp common denominators, they set a standard of no holds\r\nbarred and no standards observed. They are the opium for the masses\r\nthat religion once was, diverting potentially dangerous attention from\r\nreal events and personalities to the staged alarms of public enemies\r\nand the artificial crises of bingo lotteries. No less persecutory than\r\nany totalitarian regime, these mass media are ominous symptoms of the\r\nsocial malaise of disillusionment with the realities of life and with\r\nmore institutionalized modes of expression. They are escapism embodied,\r\na dreamland, a scape of fantasy, the vale of telenovellas. Whole\r\nnations are in thrall. In Macedonia, the protagonist of a servant's\r\nsaga, \"Kassandra\", was given a hero's welcome upon her visit to this\r\nimpoverished and bitter land. Whole families consume hours of this\r\nvisual Ritalin, hypnotized by cheap scenery built to resemble\r\nunattainable riches.\r\n\r\nThen there is the mercenary media. These are groups of hired pens and\r\nkeyboards - so called journalists who offer their services to the\r\nhighest bidder. Their price is often pathetic: a lunch a month, one\r\nhundred deutschmarks, a trip abroad and a dingy hotel room. They\r\ncollaborate with their editors and share the spoils with them. They are\r\nthe whores of the profession, ever the hungry look, ever the hat in\r\nhand, ever the submissive and furtive glances of the serfs of capital.\r\nThey often publish other people's self-serving communiqués without\r\naltering a word. I, myself, provided them with \"interviews\" which I,\r\nsolely, have authored, questions and all. Too lazy to or embittered to\r\ninvest in their profession, consumed by self-loathing and by general\r\ndisdain - they let themselves be passively abused in the dirty\r\nintercourse of money and of influence.\r\n\r\nThe mercenaries often work in brothels known as \"business-backed\r\nmedia\". These are TV stations, daily papers and periodicals owned by\r\nthe oligarchs of malignant capitalism and used by them to rubbish their\r\nopponents and flagrantly and unabashedly further their business\r\ninterests. This phenomenon is most pronounced in this land of\r\ndepredation and depravity, in Russia, where virtually all the media is\r\nnow identified with and digested by business, mafia-like interests.\r\nDespite their infamous one-sidedness, they still claim neutrality and\r\nobjectivity but these spurious claims are met with revolt by a hostile\r\npopulation, long trained to distrust the printed word and even the\r\nbroadcast image. Thus the art of \"reading between the lines\" is\r\nflourishing again and the very language is distorted by its media\r\nrapists (see: \"The Magla Vocables\"). This - the abyss opening between\r\nthe people and their language, the demise of true communication and the\r\nensuing rupture in the social fabric - are the veritable damages of\r\nenlisted journalism.\r\n\r\nPolitical vehicles are less pernicious in that their masters are well\r\nknown and their itinerary clear. Always one sided, always half truthed,\r\nforever the righteous - these rags produce no riches and they preach to\r\nthe converted, serving as bulletins and message boards rather than as\r\nmedia in any known sense. A rallying point, a flag, an emblem, a\r\ncollective memory, the group's unconscious and conscience - these\r\npapers and TV channels are often widely read, even by rivals and\r\nadversaries. They are so self-absorbed, so narcissistic, so sickeningly\r\npartial that they make for fine amusement in dreary times. There are\r\nthe coalition papers and the opposition papers, the left wing and the\r\nright wing and the centre ones. It is a colourful admixture of\r\nindignation and triumphalism, veiled threats and promises, trial\r\nballoons and drama, the daily equivalent of the romance.\r\n\r\nThus, Central, Eastern and Southern Europe do have daily papers and\r\nmagazines and periodicals and television. What they do not have is\r\nmedia even remotely resembling the Western ideal. In some countries,\r\nthis ideal is disparaged as a Western manipulative ploy or, worse,\r\nnaive idealism. In others, it is a kind of holy grail to be pursued\r\nonly in myths and narratives. Yet others view it with envy and aspire\r\nto it, but without much hope. To them, it is an ever-receding mirage.\r\nPerhaps that other phantasmagoria, the Internet, is the solution. In\r\nit, budding, fresh beginnings of irreverence and courage seem to\r\ncoalesce into recognizable - though virtual - media. The small number\r\nof web surfers currently limits both their outreach and their\r\nsurvivability. But if Western trends are anything to go by, this is a\r\ntemporary state of affairs. The Internet, this immaterial and ethereal\r\nmedium might yet spawn the first real media and a return to reality. It\r\nmight yet liberate the prisoners of all the telenovellas, foreign and\r\ndomestic. It might yet win.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Article written on February 5, 2000 and published February 21, 2000\r\n\r\nin \"Central Europe Review\" volume 2, issue 7)\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe PCM Trail\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a typical bar in a typical Balkan or East European country in a\r\ntypical yellow haze, air-polluted, very late evening. The din of\r\nraucous and numbingly repetitive music reverberates through the\r\nsmoke-enshrouded joint. It is an external pandemonium intended to\r\nsilence internal ones and to obviate the silences of solitude. Sofas\r\nwith shabby, mutilated upholstery in bordello scarlet. A dim, bawdy\r\nluminescence. Huntresses and prey study each other wearily over oily\r\ndrinks. The former scantily clad in cheap imitations of haute couture,\r\nlips enclosed in heart shaped, provocative, lipstick, their make up\r\ninvitingly gross. The latter - foreigners, owners of coveted passports,\r\ncars and money (PCM), a ticket out of hell, a path to paradise, a\r\npromise.\r\n\r\nIn the near and paranoiac past of most countries in transition,\r\nterror-filled xenophobia was both a wise survival tactic and an\r\nindoctrinated instinct. Self-insulated and psychotically suspicious\r\nregimes quarantined their populations and portrayed all foreigners as\r\ncarriers of the malaise of social disintegration and the perpetrators\r\nof espionage and sabotage. In a classic cognitive dissonance,\r\nforeigners were denounced by the people and women who befriended them\r\nwere pronounced whores. Only a select few could interact with the\r\ncapitalistic plague and these were especially trained to prevent\r\ncontagion.\r\n\r\nThese prejudices and perceptions changed fast with the dawn of the post\r\ntransition purgatory. Economic collapse, massive unemployment, social\r\ndislocation, growing disparities between rich and poor, the educated\r\nand the unskilled - led to societies increasingly permeated by crime,\r\ndrugs and prostitution. A grey cloud of hopelessness and neglect\r\ndescended upon vast territories populated by zombie-like herds of\r\npeople, eyes with extinguished light, adrift in the uncharted waters of\r\na new, ominous reality. The physical deterioration of infrastructure\r\nand public services reflected the inner state of its ever more\r\ndesparate consumers. Venality erupted like a giant suppuration.\r\nEverything was on sale, especially one's self.\r\n\r\nIn this increasingly whorish atmosphere, the perception of foreigners\r\nwas dramatically re-cast. With more of them around and with most of\r\nthem on generous income - they constituted a tempting target, a prize,\r\nsalvation embodied. Women everywhere made it a point to meet them, to\r\nwork with them, to associate with them, to know them biblically and -\r\nabove all other goals - to marry them and leave their country. All\r\nmeans justified these ends. Women studied foreign languages, applied to\r\nwork for non-government organizations, hung out in the appropriate\r\nwatering holes, learned to dress and talk assertively and to make their\r\navailability - their complete obtainability and accessibility - beyond\r\ndoubt.\r\n\r\nSome set about securing the desired trophy methodically and\r\nscientifically, calculating each step in a tortuous and highly\r\ncompetitive environment. They invested years in graduating from the\r\nright faculties and in mastering the right languages. They watched\r\nfilms intently, read books, clipped magazine articles, surfed the\r\ninternet, questioned well-travelled relatives and acquaintances,\r\nemulated more senior and more seasoned stalkers. Others relied on their\r\ngood looks, their make up, their ruthlessness, their promiscuousness,\r\ntheir connections, or the exotic allure of their very differentness.\r\n\r\nBut all of them pursued their prey doggedly and commitedly, with the\r\nquite perseverance and patience of the dejected, with the unflagging\r\ndetermination of the terminally ill in tracking a wonder drug. Often,\r\nthey got pregnant, which in many local cultures would have brought on a\r\nmarriage. Sometimes, they got raped, or dumped, or worse. But none of\r\nthese dissuaded them - such was the ejecting power of the wretchedness\r\nof their lives. They knew that the foreigner they aspire to acquire\r\nwill finally go away and carry them with him, a (sometimes white)\r\nknight on a shining vehicle. Vehemently committed to securing the\r\nfuture of their children and the present of their extended family -\r\nthey ploughed on, ignoring diversions, never digressing, never wavering\r\nin the face of setbacks and defeats.\r\n\r\nSome of them grew old and bitter in their refusal to countenance a\r\nlocal, inferior, brand of husband. It time they so identified with\r\ntheir purported quarry - that they held their own kind in contempt.\r\nThey disdained their kin, derided their customs, haughtily dismissed\r\ntheir own culture as backward and oppressive, worthy only of\r\ndiscarding. In their unmitigated effort to be worthy of their future\r\nsaviours, they disowned their very selves, their society, their\r\nupbringing, their mores and their relations. Thus uprooted, they lost\r\nboth worlds - rejected by those they rejected so condescendingly as\r\nwell as by foreign men who found them to be embarrassing, clunky\r\nimitations of B-movie characters.\r\n\r\nBut others went on to marry foreigners, to give birth to their children\r\nand, in time, to travel to far, affluent lands. They keep in touch,\r\nsending home photographs of sumptuous houses and shiny cars and of\r\nsuburban lawns. From time to time, they wire some money or deliver\r\ngifts. They visit once or twice a year, clad in new, faddish clothes,\r\ntheir accents strangely inflected, their speech suffused by foreign\r\nwords. They made it, the envy of their sisters, the objects of much\r\nadulation and emulation, lean and lustrous proofs that dreams come\r\ntrue. A sigh and then the chase goes on. Meticulous dressing, hours of\r\nmake up, the right shine but not too vulgar, the flesh exposed but not\r\nrepulsively, both offered and withdrawn, a little exercise of English\r\nand to the bar. The hunting grounds where smoke and alcohol and the\r\noccasional lascivious look or comment should do the trick. And often do.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Article written on February 8, 2000 and published February 28, 2000\r\n\r\nin \"Central Europe Review\" volume 2, issue 8)\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mind of Darkness\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The Balkans\" - I say - \"is the unconscious of the world\". People stop\r\nto digest this metaphor and then they nod enthusiastically. It is here\r\nthat the repressed memories of history, its traumas and fears and\r\nimages reside. It is here that the psychodynamics of humanity - the\r\ntectonic clash between Rome and Byzantium, West and East,\r\nJudeo-Christianity and Islam - is still easily discernible. We are\r\nseated at a New Year's dining table, loaded with a roasted pig and\r\nexotic salads. I, the Jew, only half foreign to this cradle of\r\nSlavonics, four Serbs and five Macedonians. It is in the Balkans that\r\nall ethnic distinctions fail and it is here that they prevail\r\nanachronistically and atavistically. Contradiction and change the only\r\ntwo fixtures of this tormented region.\r\n\r\nThe women of the Balkan - buried under provocative mask-like make up,\r\nretro hairstyles and too narrow dresses. The men clad in sepia colours,\r\nold-fashioned suits and turn of the century moustaches. In the\r\nbackground there is the crying game that is Balkanian music: liturgy\r\nand folk and elegy combined. The smells are heavy with musk-ular\r\nperfumes. It is like time travel. It is like revisiting one's childhood.\r\n\r\nThe Serbs - a family - are tall and ruggedly handsome. He was a soldier\r\nin the para-military Serb militias that sprang from the ashes of the\r\nJNA (Yugoslav National Army) in 1991. As the disintegration of the\r\nuneasy co-existence that once was Yugoslavia became more painfully\r\nevident, he and others seized the weapons in the depots of the JNA. In\r\nthe administrative twilight zone that ensued they fought in JNA\r\nuniforms against a growing army of Croats (wearing initially the same\r\nuniforms) and Moslem Bosniaks. It was surrealistic, a Bosch nightmare.\r\n\"We were near victory in Bihac\" - he says, his voice a wistful\r\nadmixture of melancholy and anger. \"Politics\" - an old spark in his\r\neyes and, for a moment, I can see the erstwhile fighter - \"All\r\npolitics. We lost the war because of politics, because our leaders sold\r\nthemselves to the West.\" This myth has a familiar ring to it, the ring\r\nof knife-stabbed backs and war. It is the ground being prepared for the\r\nnext round - the war was nearly won had it not been for the traitors\r\nand their Western masters. The sound of clicking heels and marches and\r\ncreaking gates of concentration camps.\r\n\r\nAnd so? \"Milosevic should go\" - he is adamant - \"we paid enough.\" He\r\nleans back and lets fatigue take over. His wife interjects: \"He drives\r\na milk truck. He collects milk from the villages and delivers it to\r\nNis. The company he works for makes 1000 DM daily - and his salary is\r\n80 DM monthly. How can you survive on 80 DM? I don't work. So, one has\r\nto steal.\" \"There is nowhere to steal from\" - I say. A moment of comic\r\nrelief, bringing identical sad smiles to their faces. \"During the war\r\n(he means the Kosovo conflict), I drove the truck - it is a big truck,\r\nyou see - and was bombed from behind by NATO planes. It was like that\r\nevery day, for more than three months but I had to deliver the milk to\r\ntown.\" Matter of factly, he lights a cigarette, his hand unshaken.\r\n\r\n\"All the politicians benefited from these wars, except Arkan (the\r\ninfamous militia military commander - SV). His son joined us and fought\r\nwith us as our commander...\" - the sentence tapers off among blue\r\nclouds of cheap smoke. \"And what did NATO achieve?\" - his brother in\r\nlaw (who is married to a Macedonian and lives in Skopje) asks. \"NATO\r\nwent in for a year and is stuck for a decade in Bosnia.\" \"And that is\r\nthe way it is going to be in Kosovo.\" \"They (the West - SV) don't know\r\nwhat they want and they don't know how to achieve it, they have no\r\nplans, they stumble, only making matters worse among us. They are\r\nignorant and ill-prepared.\"\r\n\r\nI sound incredulous: \"Do you seriously think that there would have been\r\nno wars without NATO? After all, when Yugoslavia started falling apart,\r\nthe West (with the exception of Germany) tried to preserve its unity.\r\nAmerica was very unhappy and discouraged the independence of the\r\nconstituent states.\" \"Don't you believe it\" - he is livid but not\r\naggressive, there is more pain in his voice than threat - \"Croatia\r\nwould have never embarked on its war against us had it not been for the\r\nWest. I was there, I know. And we were winning the war there when\r\nsuddenly Belgrade ordered us to stop. The commander in chief of the\r\nwhole front came to us, tears in his eyes, and said: I didn't give this\r\norder, I want you to know. It comes from above, from Belgrade, not from\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\n\"But couldn't all this have been settled differently, without\r\nbloodshed?\" - I wonder. \"Of course it could, without the meddling of\r\nthe West and its two puppets in the region (Milosevic and Tudjman -\r\nSV).\" And then, somewhat incoherently - \"They (the world - SV) should\r\nhave let us fight it out. Winner takes all the territory, that's the\r\nonly way to settle it. But Serbia has no friends anywhere in the world\r\nand we trust no one.\" \"And Kosovo?\" \"Maybe that could not have been\r\nprevented\" - he concedes - \"because Milosevic regarded Kosovo as the\r\ncornerstone of his regime.\"\r\n\r\nWe talk about nothing else. The wounds are too fresh and too prominent\r\nto politely ignore. We enter the New Millennium with the blood dripping\r\nbaggage of the old one. He fought three years in Bosnia, in Sarajevo,\r\nnear Banja Luka. He is a war criminal, wanted by the international\r\ntribunal in The Hague. \"Milosevic determined our ultimate borders in\r\nDayton\" - he spits the words bitterly, a look of bewilderment in his\r\neyes - \"Who gave him the mandate to represent us? Someone else should\r\nhave gone there, like Karadzic, maybe...\" \"But Milosevic gave you\r\nweapons and food and supplies. Without him surely you could not have\r\nsurvived as long as you did?\" \"No weapons\" - he protests - \"Weapons we\r\nappropriated, we took them ourselves, from the JNA depots, he deserves\r\nno credit for that. Food, maybe... But this does not give him the right\r\nto determine our borders and our future without as much as consulting\r\nus. He sold us to the West. Now look at the situation. I can't go back\r\nto my home in a town that was 100% Serb and now is 100% Moslem and the\r\nMoslems can't go back to their towns who are now 100% Serb. And all\r\ntowns - Serb and Moslem alike - are deserted ghost towns, where no one\r\nlives and nothing grows. Now I have to live in Serbia.\"\r\n\r\nI don't ask him what he did to become wanted and hunted by the Hague\r\ntribunal. I can't imagine him murdering cold bloodedly or raping. He\r\nhas a good face, the wrinkles of many smiles and kindly eyes. When he\r\nlaughs softly, they light up in black fire and his handshake is warm\r\nand firm. Instead I say: \"And now it's Montenegro's turn should they\r\ndeclare independence?\"\r\n\r\nThere is uneasy silence. The Serbs among us move in their chairs,\r\nglance warily at each other, as though co-ordinating an as yet unspoken\r\nanswer. Finally: \"There will be no war in Montenegro. The Serbs will\r\nnot attack the Montenegrins - but there will be a civil war among the\r\nMontenegrins themselves, if they declare independence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Today\" - says the ex militiaman - \"they are all better off than the\r\nSerbs in Serbia. The Slovenes, the Croats. Look what we achieved in a\r\ndecade of 'Great Serbia' - shortly, only Belgrade will remain in the\r\nFederation, even Sandjak and Vojvodina will leave.\" \"The problem is\r\nthat we have no leadership. There is no one to replace Milosevic.\r\nAvramovic is way too old. Dzindzic and Draskovic we cannot trust...\"\r\n\"Political whores\" - says someone - \"Once with Milosevic, once\r\nwithout...\" \"...and who else is there? All the young, capable people\r\nare out and away, far far away as they can get...\"\r\n\r\nLike in all the other countries of transition, they are adherents of\r\nthe cult of youth. The belief that the old - old people, old culture,\r\nold institutions - have been so heavily corrupted that they must be\r\ndiscarded thoroughly and mercilessly. That all has to start over again.\r\nThat only the young can cope with the timeless riddles that Balkanian\r\nsphinxes are in the habit of posing. That the young are the only bridge\r\nto the promised land of the zeitgeist of capitalism.\r\n\r\n\"And Macedonia?\" - I ask.\r\n\r\n\"Macedonia\" - a Serb chorus around the dinner table - \"Every village\r\nwants to become a country. Macedonia cannot survive on its own, it is\r\ntoo dependent on Serbia, it is too tiny.\"\r\n\r\n\"But only 17% of its trade is with Serbia\" - I correct them, as gently\r\nas I can. \"Including Kosovo?\" - says one in great astonishment - \"I see\r\nonly Macedonian trucks in Serbia, it cannot be...\"\r\n\r\n\"It cannot be\" - they all conclude - \"Macedonia is nothing without\r\nSerbia.\"\r\n\r\nAs the clock strikes midnight, we kiss each other on wine flushed\r\ncheeks and shake hands solemnly. In the rest of the world, a new\r\nmillennium may have dawned. But in the Balkans it is perhaps the end of\r\nthe beginning - but hardly the beginning of the end.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Article written on January 8, 2000 and published January 17, 2000\r\n\r\nin \"Central Europe Review\" volume 2, issue 2)\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the Rain\r\n\r\nHow the West\r\n\r\nLost the East\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ECONOMY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCentral Europe\r\n\r\n\r\nThe New Colonies\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMercantilism was the intellectual correlate of colonialism. The idea,\r\nroughly, was to physically conquer territories (colonies), subjugate\r\ntheir people, transform them into cheap labour, get hold of all the raw\r\nmaterials and ship them to the colonizer's territory, there to be\r\nprocessed to yield finished products. The beauty in the concept was the\r\n\"closed circuit\" logic. The inhabitants of the colonies (also known as\r\n\"natives\") had to consume finished goods and products. The colonial\r\npower forced upon them (through tariff and quota regimes or violence\r\nwhen needed) the finished products produced from their very own raw\r\nmaterials! Thus, the colonies were prevailed upon to sell cheap raw\r\nmaterials and to buy expensive finished goods.\r\n\r\nIf it sounds like colonialism and has the same economic effects - it is\r\ncolonialism. The relationship between the European Union and Central\r\nEurope is colonialism. Central Europe provides the European Union with\r\nraw materials and cheap labour. It buys from the European Union\r\nfinished goods, products and services. In the process, it incurs\r\nenormous trade and balance of payments deficits. Incidentally, it also\r\nserves as the EU's dumping grounds for anything from toxic waste to\r\nshoddy or outmoded products.\r\n\r\nLet us examine the case of the Czech Republic. It is the assembly plant\r\nof Volkswagen and the export launching pad of other multinationals. And\r\nthe workers are supposed to consume heavily subsidized agricultural\r\nproduce (such as pork).\r\n\r\nFor this the Czech Republic is to blame. The previous government did\r\neverything it could to alienate its natural allies in the Vysehrad\r\nTriangle. It did a good job of it. Instead of negotiating with the EU\r\nas a bloc of c. 70 million consumers - it ended up representing an\r\never-diminishing number of Czecho-Slovaks. Its haughty and\r\ncorruption-laden behaviour did not acquire too many friends in the\r\nWest, either.\r\n\r\nThe approach should have been different. In the West, the client is\r\nalways right. The Czechs are CONSUMERS. They are the clients of the\r\nhuge corporation called EU. As a consumer club or group, they could\r\nhave dictated terms, rather than be subjected to them. The current\r\nHungarian government understands this. Consumers have a single,\r\nirresistible power: they can stop consuming. Imagine if 30-40 billion\r\nUSD were to be deleted from the EU's books by angry consumers - it\r\nwould have come begging and negotiating, instead of dictating and\r\ncondescending. The EU does not hesitate to pull every lever - however\r\nillegitimate, ridiculous, or downright dangerous - in its negotiations\r\nwith the new applicants. The new applicants did not assimilate yet\r\ntheir dual role as applicants (an inferior position) and as markets (a\r\nvery superior position).\r\n\r\nThis inferiority complex has to do with history. The Hussite Wars were\r\nperhaps glorious - but they were also irrevocably destructive. Not only\r\nwere the Czech Lands physically demolished - they were also cut from\r\nthe rest of Europe for centuries to come. The only times they were\r\nreincorporated into it were traumatic (the Nazi occupation, for\r\ninstance). Having glimpsed the first real opportunity to become a part\r\nof the big west dream (and to be redeemed from the clutches of the\r\nwounded Russian bear to the East) - the Czechs lost all judgement,\r\nself-esteem, self-confidence and negotiating skills. So did all the\r\nother Central and Eastern (and Southern) European nations. It was\r\nsecurity and safety they were after - not prosperity.\r\n\r\nThis basic misunderstanding underlies the great European project. The\r\nEU's thinking was mainly economic and marginally geopolitical (though\r\nit was presented differently). The Czech's motivation was mainly\r\ngeopolitical and marginally economic (though it was presented\r\ndifferently). The resulting malentendues are worthy of Moliere's pen.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the Czechs have always been a religious breed. True, they are\r\nthe most vehement atheists in Europe - but this is because they adopted\r\nother deities. They have always been zealous, intellectual fanatics.\r\nOne of my Czech friends calls many periods in his nation's history\r\n\"intellectual terrorism\". The swings some people made lately from being\r\nyouthful communists to being vengeful ultra-capitalists are indeed\r\nbreathtaking. Personality cults are supplanted only by fanatic\r\nideologies, which are replaced only by religious zeal. This, of course,\r\ndoes not tend to enhance the realpolitik instincts of the nation.\r\nCzechs have always been a few years too early. They had their own\r\nreformation long before Luther. They had the Spring of 68 long before\r\nGorbachev. Every such intellectual transition was followed by a Jacobin\r\ndisposal and by purges of whole classes and elites. These \"new\r\nreligion-personality cult-purges\" cycles were not absent from the\r\nVelvet Revolution.\r\n\r\nSimply, the EU got frightened. Excessive zeal can give anyone - let\r\nalone the Brussels amphibian bureaucrats - cold feet. Dates are being\r\npushed back. Commitments hushed or rehashed. Now the Czechs \"enjoy\" the\r\nworst of both worlds: they are being treated as a colony and their date\r\nof entry is ceaselessly postponed.\r\n\r\nThis should and could have been different. The Czechs should not have\r\nshown any enthusiasm or anxiety. These are bad negotiating tactics.\r\nThey should have negotiated with the EU as consumers (markets) do with\r\nproducers elsewhere in the world. They should have extracted at least a\r\ncommitment regarding the date of accession and detailed timetables. And\r\nthey should have kept these timetables.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Article published December 14, 1998 in \"The New Presence\")\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNew Paradigms, Old Cycles\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNew paradigms die hard. It took a looming global recession to convince\r\nwild-eyed optimists that old cycles are more reliable guides than new\r\nparadigms.\r\n\r\nBusiness cycles - from the smallest to the biggest - go through seven\r\nphases. Centuries of cumulative economic experience allow us to\r\nidentify these stages more accurately than ever before.\r\n\r\nAn economic cycle invariably starts with inflation. The previous cycle\r\nhaving ended - and the new one just began - the economic environment is\r\nas uncertain as can be. The fundamental component is the scarcity of\r\ngoods and services (following recession or deflation) and the\r\nmaladapted money supply. Too much money chases fewer commodities. The\r\ngeneral price level rises. But this constant, ubiquitous, all pervasive\r\nrise (known as \"inflation\") is also the result of mass psychology.\r\nHouseholds and firms compensate for the growing uncertainty (=growing\r\nrisk) by raising prices. They have no idea what should the appropriate\r\nor optimal equilibrium price level be. Market signals are garbled by\r\npsychological noise. Everyone is trying to stay ahead of perceived\r\neconomic threats and instabilities by raising the risk premiums that\r\nthey demand from their clients. Consumers, on the other hand, are\r\nwilling to pay more today because they are convinced that the price\r\ntrend is unidirectional and irreversible: up. The psychological\r\nunderpinnings and bearings of inflation have been studied deeply in the\r\nlast few decades. It is the source of the uncertainty that remained\r\nobscure. My hypothesis is that the end of every economic cycle fosters\r\nthis panicky uncertainty, which is monetarily reflected as inflation.\r\nIn more technical terms, inflation is a market pathology, a market\r\nfailure.\r\n\r\nInflation disguises bad economic performance of firms and of the\r\neconomy as a whole. \"Paper\" profits make up for operational losses. The\r\nincentives to innovate, modernize, and enhance productivity suffer.\r\nEconomic yardsticks and benchmarks get distorted and do not allow for\r\nmeaningful analysis of the performance of the economy. Inflation leads\r\nto technological and economic stagnation. Plants do not modernize, the\r\nfinancial aspects of the firm's operations are emphasized, the\r\nindustrial and operational aspects de-emphasized and neglected.\r\nEconomies are seized by the pathological economic condition known as\r\n\"stagflation\" - zero or negative growth, coupled with inflation. A\r\nsense of urgency and crisis sets in and clears the path towards the\r\nnext, second phase.\r\n\r\nIn an effort to overcome the pernicious effects of inflation,\r\ngovernments liberalize, deregulate and open their economies to\r\ncompetition. Firms innovate and streamline. Efficiency, productivity\r\nand competitiveness are the buzzwords of this phase. As trade barriers\r\nfall, cross border capital flows (=investment) increase, productivity\r\ngains and new products are introduced - the upward price spiral is\r\nhalted and contained. The same money buys better products (more\r\nreliable, more functions, more powerful). The same wages generate more\r\nproducts. This is technological deflation. It is beneficial to the\r\neconomy in that it frees economic resources and encourages their\r\nefficient allocation. Real incomes rise and generate increased demand\r\nand production.\r\n\r\nInevitably, technical deflation leads to a restraint in the general\r\nprice level. Increased consumption (both public and private) coupled\r\nwith moderate asset price inflation prevents an outright monetary\r\ndeflation (=a downward spiral in the general price level). Inflation is\r\nkept to sustainable levels. This phase is known as \"disinflation\". It\r\nis a transitory phase. The transition from hyperinflation or high\r\ninflation to a supportable level of inflation is a matter of one or two\r\ndecades. This period is bound to be shortened by the revolutions in\r\ninformation, communications and transportation technologies. In fact,\r\nthe whole cycle is hastened due to the more rapid dissemination of\r\ninformation. It is the availability and accessibility of information,\r\nwhich determines the values of important parameters such as the\r\nequilibrium general price level and other parameters of expectations\r\n(such as equity prices). The more information is available more readily\r\n- the more efficient the markets and the shorter the cycles. This\r\nenhances the false perception of instability inherent in modern\r\nmarkets. But speed does not necessarily a imply lack of stability. On\r\nthe contrary, the faster and more violent the adjustments in the market\r\nmechanism - the more efficient it is.\r\n\r\nThe psychological well-being and assurance brought on by disinflation\r\ngenerate demand for assets, especially yielding assets (such as real\r\nestate or financial assets). The more certain the future value of\r\nstreams of income, the more open the economic environment, the shorter\r\nthe economic cycle, the more frequent and rapid the economic\r\ninteractions - the more valuable assets become. Assets are mainly\r\nstores of expectations regarding future values. An assets bubble is\r\ncreated when the current value (=price) of money is low and the future\r\nvalue of money is certain and likely to grow through stable or\r\ndecreasing prices. Stock exchanges, real estate, and financial\r\ntransactions - all balloon out of proportion in a kind of irrational\r\nexuberance.\r\n\r\nAll bubbles burst in the end - and so do these assets bubbles. This is\r\nthe fifth phase. It is crucial because it signifies the termination of\r\nthe bull part of the cycle. The prices of assets collapse\r\nprecipitously. There are no buyers - only sellers. Firms find it\r\nimpossible to raise money because their obligations (commercial paper\r\nand bonds) are rendered valueless. A credit crunch ensues. Investment\r\nhalts.\r\n\r\nThe collapse of assets bubbles generates asset price deflation. The\r\npsychological counterpart of this deflation is the disappearance of the\r\n\"wealth effect\" and its replacement by a \"thrift effect\". This\r\ninfluences consumption, inventories, sales, employment and other\r\nimportant angles of the real economy. If not countered by monetary and\r\nfiscal means - a lowering of interest rates, a fiscal Keynesian\r\nstimulus, an increase in money supply targets - a monetary deflation\r\nmight set in. Admittedly, a full-fledged deflation is rare. More\r\nfrequent are a recession, a slump, a credit crunch, a slowdown, a\r\ngrowth recession and other less exotic variants. It is also possible to\r\nhave differentiated or discriminatory deflation. This is a deflation in\r\ncertain sectors of the economy or in certain territories of the globe -\r\nbut not in others. In any case, a monetary deflation is a monstrous,\r\nvenomous economic beast. Due to reversed expectations (that prices will\r\ncontinue to go down), people postpone their consumption and spending.\r\nReal interest rates skyrocket because in an environment of negative\r\ninflation, even a zero interest rate is high in real terms. Investment\r\nand production slump - inventories shoot up, further depressing prices.\r\nThe decline in output is accompanied by widespread bankruptcies and by\r\na steep increase in unemployment. The real value of debt increases.\r\nCoupled with declining prices of assets, it leads to bank failures as a\r\nresult of debts gone sour. It is a self-perpetuating state of affairs\r\nand it calls for the implementation of the seventh and last phase of\r\nthe cycle.\r\n\r\nThis is the phase of reflation. The market failure, at this stage, is\r\nso pervasive that all the self-balancing and allocation mechanisms are\r\nrendered dysfunctional. State intervention is needed in order to\r\nrestart the economy. An injection of money through a fiscal stimulus, a\r\nmonetary expansion, a lowering of interest rates, firm support of the\r\nfinancial system, tax and other incentives to consume and to import.\r\nUnfortunately, all these goals are best achieved by engaging in\r\nwarfare. It is often the case: a convenient war reflates the economy,\r\nre-ignites the economic engine, generates employment, and increases\r\nconsumption, innovation and modernization. But with or without war -\r\npeople sense the demise of an old cycle and the imminent birth of a new\r\none, fraught with uncertainty and ignorance. They rush to buy things.\r\nBecause the economy is just recovering from deflation - there aren't\r\nusually many things to buy. A lot of money chasing few goods - this is\r\na recipe for inflation. Back to phase one.\r\n\r\nBut the various phases of the cycle are not only affected by psychology\r\n- they affect it. During periods of inflation people are willing to\r\ntake on risk. The risk of inflation is clear to them and the only\r\ncompensation is through higher yields (returns, profits) on financial\r\ninstruments. Yet, higher returns inevitably and invariably imply higher\r\nrisks. Thus, people are forced to offset or mitigate one type of risk\r\n(inflation) with another (credit or investment risk). Paradoxically, an\r\ninflationary period is a period of certainty. Inflation is certain.\r\nPeople tend to develop an ideological type of economics. Based on the\r\nunderlying and undeniable certainty of ever-worsening conditions, the\r\nintellectual elite and decision-makers resort to peremptory, radical,\r\nrigid and sometimes coercive solutions backed by an ideology disguised\r\nas \"scientific knowledge\". Communism is a prime example, of course -\r\nbut so is the \"Free Marketry\" variant of capitalism, as practised by\r\nthe IMF and by central bankers.\r\n\r\nDeflation, on the other hand, is usually a much shorter period. People\r\ndo not expect it to last. They fully expect it to be followed by\r\ninflation - they just do not know when. Thus, its nature is more\r\ntransitory. Assured of low prices and preoccupied with economic\r\nsurvival - people become strongly risk averse. While in times of\r\ninflation people are seeking to protect the value of their money - in\r\ntimes of deflation people are in pursuit of sheer livelihood. A\r\ndangerous \"stability\" sets in. People invest in land, cash and, the\r\nmore daring, in bonds. Banks do the same. In such times, ideologies are\r\nthe first victims. They are replaced by philosophies and worldviews.\r\nPeople become much more pragmatic. They look to the possible rather\r\nthan to the ideal. Communism is replaced by Socialism, Capitalism\r\nreplaces Free Marketry. Perhaps this is the only good outcome of\r\ndeflation.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Article published November 9, 1998 in \"The New Presence\")\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLessons in Transition\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion: What have been the most successful approaches to attracting\r\ndirect foreign investments: offering prospective investors tax breaks\r\nand similar benefits, or improving the overall investment climate of\r\nthe country?\r\n\r\nAnswer: Empirical research has demonstrated that investors are not\r\nlured by tax breaks and monetary or fiscal investment incentives. They\r\nwill take advantage of existing schemes (and ask for more, pitting one\r\ncountry against another). But these will never be the determining\r\nfactors in their decision-making. They are much more likely to be\r\nswayed by the level of protection of property rights, degree of\r\ncorruption, transparency, state of the physical infrastructure,\r\neducation and knowledge of foreign languages and \"mission critical\r\nskills\", geographical position and proximity to markets and culture and\r\nmentality.\r\n\r\nQuestion: What have been successful techniques for countries to improve\r\ntheir previously negative investment image?\r\n\r\nAnswer: The politicians of the country need to be seen to be\r\ntransparently, non-corruptly encouraging business, liberalizing and\r\nprotecting the property rights of investors. One real, transparent (for\r\ninstance through international tender) privatisation; one case where\r\nthe government supported a foreigner against a local; one politician\r\nseverely punished for corruption and nepotism; one fearless news medium\r\n- change a country's image.\r\n\r\nQuestion: Should there be restrictions on repatriation of foreign\r\ninvestment capital (such restrictions could prevent an investment\r\npanic, but at the same time they negatively affect investor's\r\nconfidence)?\r\n\r\nAnswer: Short term and long term capital flows are two disparate\r\nphenomena with very little in common. The former is speculative and\r\ntechnical in nature and has very little to do with fundamental\r\nrealities. The latter is investment oriented and committed to the\r\nincreasing of the welfare and wealth of its new domicile. It is,\r\ntherefore, wrong to talk about \"global capital flows\". There are\r\ninvestments (including even long term portfolio investments and venture\r\ncapital) - and there is speculative, \"hot\" money. While \"hot money\" is\r\nvery useful as a lubricant on the wheels of liquid capital markets in\r\nrich countries - it can be destructive in less liquid, immature\r\neconomies or in economies in transition. The two phenomena should be\r\naccorded a different treatment. While long-term capital flows should be\r\ncompletely liberalized, encouraged and welcomed - the short term, \"hot\r\nmoney\" type should be controlled and even discouraged. The introduction\r\nof fiscally oriented capital controls (as Chile has implemented) is one\r\npossibility. The less attractive Malaysian model springs to mind. It is\r\nless attractive because it penalizes both the short term and the\r\nlong-term financial players. But it is clear that an important and\r\nintegral part of the new International Financial Architecture MUST be\r\nthe control of speculative money in pursuit of ever-higher yields.\r\nThere is nothing inherently wrong with high yields - but the capital\r\nmarkets provide yields connected to economic depression and to price\r\ncollapses through the mechanism of short selling and through the usage\r\nof certain derivatives. This aspect of things must be neutered or at\r\nleast countered.\r\n\r\nQuestion: What approach has been most useful in best serving the needs\r\nof small businesses: through private business support firms, business\r\nassociations, or by government agencies?\r\n\r\nAnswer: It depends where. In Israel (until the beginning of the 90s),\r\nSouth Korea and Japan (until 1997) - the state provided the necessary\r\ndirection and support. In the USA - the private sector invented its own\r\nenormously successful support structures (such as venture capital\r\nfunds). The right approach depends on the characteristics of the\r\ncountry in question: how entrepreneurial are its citizens, how\r\naccessible are credits and microcredits to SMEs, how benign are the\r\nbankruptcy laws (which always reflect a social ethos), how good is its\r\nphysical infrastructure, how educated are its citizens and so on.\r\n\r\nQuestion: How might collective action problems among numerous and\r\ndispersed small and medium entrepreneurs best be dealt with?\r\n\r\nAnswer: It is a strange question to ask in the age of cross-Atlantic\r\ntransportation, telecommunication and computer networks (such as the\r\nInternet). Geographical dispersion is absolutely irrelevant. The\r\nproblem is in the diverging self-interests of the various players. The\r\nmore numerous they are, the more niche-orientated, the smaller - the\r\nlesser the common denominator. A proof of this fragmentation is the\r\ndeclining power of cartels - trade unions, on the one hand and business\r\ntrusts, monopolies and cartels, on the other hand. The question is not\r\nwhether this can be overcome but whether it SHOULD be overcome. Such\r\ndiversity of interests is the lifeblood of the modern market economy,\r\nwhich is based on conflicts and disagreements as much as it is based on\r\nthe ability to ultimately compromise and reach a consensus. What needs\r\nto be done centrally is public relations and education. People,\r\npoliticians, big corporations need to be taught the value and\r\nadvantages of small business, of entrepreneurship and intrapreneurship.\r\nAnd new ways to support this sector need to be constantly devised.\r\n\r\nQuestion: How might access of small business to start-up capital and\r\nother resources best be facilitated?\r\n\r\nAnswer: The traditional banks all over the world failed at maintaining\r\nthe balancing act between risk and reward. The result was a mega shift\r\nto the capital markets. Stock exchanges for trading the shares of small\r\nand technology companies sprang all over the world (NASDAQ in the USA,\r\nthe former USM in London, the Neuemarkt in Germany and so on).\r\nInvestment and venture capital funds became the second most important\r\nsource quantitatively. They not only funded budding entrepreneurs but\r\nalso coached them and saw them through the excruciating and dangerous\r\nresearch and development phases. But these are rich world solutions. An\r\nimportant development is the invention of \"third world solutions\" such\r\nas microcredits granted to the agrarian or textile sectors, mainly to\r\nwomen and which involve the whole community.\r\n\r\nQuestion: Women start one-third of new businesses in the region: now\r\ncan this contribution to economic growth be further stimulated?\r\n\r\nAnswer: By providing them with the conditions to work and exercise\r\ntheir entrepreneurial skills. By establishing day care centres for\r\ntheir children. By providing microcredits (women have proven to be\r\ninordinately reliable borrowers). By giving them tax credits. By\r\nallowing or encouraging flexitime or part time work or work from home.\r\nBy recognizing the home as the domicile of business (especially through\r\nthe appropriate tax laws). By equalizing their legal rights and their\r\npay. By protecting them from sexual or gender harassment.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Article written on October 15, 1999 and published November 22, 1999\r\n\r\nin \"Central Europe Review\" volume 1, issue 22)\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLucky Russia\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs early as August 17th, a few minutes following the devaluation, the\r\nfinancial markets predicted that the Rouble would stabilize around\r\n18-20 Roubles to the US dollar. This was the price quoted for CME\r\nforward Rouble contracts. Moreover, not everyone think that\r\nhyperinflation is imminent. Simply, there is not enough purchasing\r\npower to generate this kind of surge in prices.\r\n\r\nRussia is lucky. I am not being cute: this crisis could not have come\r\nat a more opportune time. Russians have witnessed (if not actively\r\nenjoyed) the advantages of a consumer capitalist economy. For one\r\nthing, most of them have some kind of private property and the\r\nabundance of all types of products together with the elimination of\r\nqueues and shortages served to provide a foretaste of the \"capitalist\r\nheaven\". They are not likely to go back, politically or economically.\r\nThat capitalism is not well entrenched is a blessing in no disguise:\r\nthis crisis does not deprive people sufficiently to foster a\r\nrevolution. Social unrest, a dramatic rise in crime rates, more crony\r\ncapitalism and other malignant forms of \"get rich quick\" schemes -\r\nperhaps. But not another revolution.\r\n\r\nRussia and Russians are prone to dramatic extremes. Russia is simply\r\ngoing through a crisis which will ultimately engulf all of Eastern,\r\nCentral and Southern Europe and, more generally, all the protective,\r\netatist economies. From Macedonia to the Czech Republic, from\r\nKazakhstan to China, from Slovenia to Bulgaria - all are likely to\r\nexperience a similar shock. This is because none has really reformed.\r\nUnder the banner of \"capitalism\" a small, corrupt elite of oligarchs\r\nand politicians robbed the assets of the state. Industry is still\r\nprotected against outside competition, tax collection is a farce, the\r\nbanking system a shambles, Western handouts the only pillar of the\r\neconomy. This cannot and will not go on. The invisible hand of the\r\nmarket will devalue overvalued currencies, force industry to\r\nrestructure, force the banking system to amalgamate, force inept and\r\ncorrupt politicians out. The Day of Judgement is here. Russia is lucky\r\nto go through all this now - because it will be uniquely positioned, as\r\na result.\r\n\r\nThe Russian banking system will be forced to restructure. Hundreds of\r\nbanks will go insolvent and bankrupt. The rest will consolidate. But\r\nthis will only result in the formation of a few \"bad banks\". The next\r\nstages will involve the formation of healthy retail activities, where\r\nnone exist today. Banks will begin to compete for savings. They will\r\ndiversify their portfolio and, as a result, their exposure (risk) will\r\ndiminish. Then they will have to invest this money to generate the kind\r\nof returns that will attract the savers. They will not risk another\r\nasset bubble. They will not invest in brokerage operations, speculate,\r\nor bet against the Rouble anymore. Their future profits will be the\r\nresult of investments in real assets: industry, the services sector,\r\nnew and small businesses. These are very good news: the banks have been\r\ntaught a lesson they will not easily forget. It is: paper profits and\r\npaper assets are on paper only. Here today, gone tomorrow.\r\n\r\nA devalued Rouble will enhance the competitiveness of the Russian\r\nindustrial and commodity production sectors. Rouble inflation will not\r\nfully reflect the devaluation for a long time. This difference will\r\nallow Russian manufacturers and commodity producers to compete\r\nvigorously.\r\n\r\nRussia was long subjected to the quack \"medical experiments\" of the\r\nIMF. It was led down the path of deflation, which the IMF has plunged\r\nhalf the world into. It needed to reflate urgently. It could not have\r\n\"chosen\" a better way to do so. The devaluation will reflate the\r\neconomy. It is equivalent to the infusion of new blood to a body\r\ndilapidated by endless austerity and economic bloodletting.\r\n\r\nIt might sound outlandish - but Russia is showing the way to other\r\ncountries in the Third World as it has so often done in the past. It,\r\nin effect, has acted against the IMF dictates and by devaluing its\r\ncurrency it has readopted the path of John Maynard Keynes. It was about\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Article published August, 1998 in \"The New Presence\"\r\n\r\nand October 28, 1998 in \"Argumenti i fakti\")\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRussian Roulette\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe more involved the IMF gets in the Russian economy - the more\r\ncontroversy surrounds it. True, economies in transition, emerging\r\neconomies, developing countries and, lately, even Asian Tigers all feel\r\nthe brunt of the IMF recipes. All are loudly complaining. Some\r\neconomists regard this as a sign of the proper functioning of the IMF -\r\nothers spot some justice in some of the complaints. The IMF is supposed\r\nto promote international monetary cooperation, establish a multilateral\r\nsystem of payments, assist countries with Balance of Payments (BOP)\r\ndifficulties under adequate safeguards, lessen the duration and the\r\ndegree of disequilibrium in the international BOPS of member countries\r\nand promote exchange rate stability, the signing of orderly exchange\r\nagreements and the avoidance of competitive exchange depreciation.\r\n\r\nIt tries to juggle all these goals in the thinning air of the global\r\ncapital markets. There is little dispute that the IMF is indispensable.\r\nWithout it, the world monetary system would have contracted more\r\nreadily and many countries would be worse off. It imposes monetary and\r\nfiscal discipline, forces governments to plan, and introduces painful\r\nadjustments and reforms. It serves as a convenient scapegoat: the\r\npoliticians can blame it for the economic woes that their voters\r\nendure. Lately, it began to lend credibility to countries and to manage\r\ncrisis situations. But, this scapegoat role allows politicians in\r\nRussia to hide behind the IMF leaf and blame the results of their\r\nincompetence and corruption on it. Where a reformed market economy\r\ncould have provided a swifter and more resolute adjustment - the\r\ndiversion of scarce human and financial resources to negotiating with\r\nthe IMF seems to have prolonged the agony. The abrogation of\r\nresponsibility by decision makers poses a moral hazard: if successful -\r\nthe credit goes to the politicians, if not - the IMF is always to\r\nblame. Negative feelings, which would have normally brought about a\r\nreal, transparent, corruption-free, efficient market economy are vented\r\nand deflected.\r\n\r\nThe IMF money in Russia encourages corrupt and inefficient spending\r\nbecause it cannot really be controlled and monitored. The rule is: the\r\nmore resources the Federal and regional governments have - the more\r\nwill be lost to corruption and inefficiency. The IMF cannot rationalize\r\nspending in Russia because its control mechanisms are flawed: they rely\r\ntoo heavily on local, official input and they are remote (from\r\nWashington). They are also underfunded.\r\n\r\nDespite these shortcomings, the IMF assumed - and not only in the case\r\nof Russia - two roles which were not historically allocated to it. It\r\nbecame a country credit risk-rating agency. The absence of an IMF seal\r\nof approval could - and usually does - mean financial suffocation.\r\nRussia experienced it last month. No banks or donor countries extend\r\ncredit to a country lacking the IMF's endorsement. On the other hand,\r\nas authority (to rate) shifted - so did responsibility. The IMF became\r\na super-guarantor of the debts of both the public and private sectors.\r\nThis encourages irresponsible lending and investments (\"why worry, the\r\nIMF will bail me out in case of default\"). This is the \"Moral Hazard\":\r\nthe safety net is fast being transformed into a licence to gamble. The\r\nprofits accrue to the gambler - the losses to the IMF. This does not\r\nencourage prudence or discipline. There is no better example than the\r\nbloated and wrongly priced Russian market for short-term government\r\nobligations, the GKOs.\r\n\r\nThe IMF is too restricted in both its ability to operate and in its\r\nability to conceptualise and to innovate. It, therefore, resorts to\r\nprescribing the same medicine of austerity to all the sovereign\r\npatients, which are suffering from a myriad of economic diseases. And\r\nit is doing so with utter disregard and ignorance of the local social,\r\ncultural (even economic) realities. Add to this the fact that the IMF's\r\nability to influence the financial markets in an age of globalisation\r\nis dubious (the daily turnover in the foreign exchange markets alone is\r\n6 times the total resources of the IMF). The result is fiascos like\r\nSouth Korea and Indonesia where 40-60 billion USD aid packages was\r\nconsumed by sick economies in days to no avail. More and more, the IMF\r\nlooks anachronistic and its goals untenable. The IMF also displays the\r\nwhole gamut of problems which plague every bureaucratic institution:\r\ndiscrimination (why help Mexico, which shares a border with the USA and\r\nnot Bulgaria, which doesn't?), politicisation (South Korean and\r\nIndonesian officials complained that the IMF officials tried to\r\nsurreptitiously introduce trade concessions to the USA into an\r\notherwise financial package of measures) and too much red tape.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the IMF forces governments to restrict flows of\r\ncapital and goods, and to reduce budget and balance of payments\r\ndeficits. Consequently, governments find themselves caught between\r\nnon-compliance with the IMF performance criteria - and addiction to its\r\nassistance. The crusader-economist Michel Chossudowski wrote once that\r\nthe IMF's adjustment policies \"trigger the destruction of whole\r\neconomies\". This looks a trifle overblown. But the process that he\r\ndescribes is, to some extent, true and fully applicable to Russia.\r\n\r\nThe inevitable devaluation of the Rouble (supposed to encourage exports\r\nand stabilize the currency) will lead to increased inflation. The\r\nhigher prices will burden businesses and increase their default rates.\r\nThe banks will increase their interest rates to compensate for higher\r\nrisks and for inflation. Wages in Russia are never fully indexed or\r\npaid timely so the purchasing power of households will be further\r\neroded. Despite recent posturing, tax revenues will fall as a result of\r\na decrease in wages and the collapse of many businesses. Thus, the\r\nbudget will be either cruelly cut or the budget deficit will increase.\r\nThe options of raising taxes or improving the collection methods are\r\nfantastic in the chaotic environment euphemistically known as the\r\nRussian Economy. The Rising costs of manufacturing (fuel and freight\r\nare denominated in foreign currencies and so do many of the tradable\r\ninputs) will lead to the pricing out of the local markets of many local\r\nfirms. A flood of cheaper imports will ensue. The comparative\r\nadvantages of Russia will disappear as it slides into ever growing\r\ntrade deficits. Finally, The Russians believe, Western creditors will\r\ntake over the national economic policy. Communism will be replaced by\r\nIMF-ism. No country is independent if the strings of its purse are held\r\nby others. Russians, too nationalistic to acquiesce, will rebel. The\r\nprice will be partly paid by the likes of the Prague Stock Exchange.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Article published October 2, 1998 in \"The New Presence\")\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nForeigners do not Like Russia\r\n\r\n\r\nRussia's New Economy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith no Russian in sight, foreigners like to belittle and mock Russia.\r\n\"It is a criminal gangland\" (an American term which better fits Italy),\r\n\"corrupt\" (Belgium is more corrupt), \"bureaucratic\" (try Germany). They\r\npoint to its 160 billion USD in foreign debt. But this is one of the\r\nlowest rates in the world (c. 40% of GDP). The USA owes almost twice as\r\nmuch per its GDP.\r\n\r\nForeigners do not like Russia. Russia should stop relying on them so\r\nheavily. Not because of nationalistic reasons. Because of realistic\r\nones. It is not realistic to expect foreign institutions and lenders\r\n(such as the IMF) to provide Russia with another 45 billion roubles. It\r\nwas the IMF that de-monetised the Russian economy. Its outlandish\r\ndemands to limit the money supply reduced the amount of roubles in\r\ncirculation to a dangerous, life-threatening, level (15% of GDP). The\r\nresult was an unprecedented barter economy (more than 75% of all\r\ntransactions) and a collapse of the popular trust in the rouble.\r\n\r\nThere has never been a post-communist \"Russian Economy\". There was a\r\n\"Moscow Economy\" and a \"Rest of Russia Economy\". The first was a bubble\r\nof consumption, novelty seeking, vanity and financial assets. The\r\n\"crisis\" in August was merely the bursting of the MUSCOVITE bubble. How\r\ncome I consider this to be good for Russia?\r\n\r\nFirst, it will weed out the weak economic players. Shady companies, the\r\nmanufacturers of shoddy goods, financial leeches and parasites - all\r\nwill vanish together with easy, corrupt and criminal money. Foreign\r\nfirms, which came over to ride the wave of unbridled consumerism and to\r\nmake a quick buck, will go home. The export revenues of oligarchs and\r\nrobber barons will revert back to the nation. In time, their\r\ninefficient and corrupt fiefdoms and monopolies will crumble. They may\r\neven begin to pay taxes.\r\n\r\nMultinationals committed to the still promising Russian market will not\r\ngo away. They will invest more and provide even more credits to local\r\nsuppliers and partners. They will hire good staff, reduce costs and\r\nfinally acknowledge the existence of life (and markets) outside Moscow.\r\nThe crisis in Moscow is blessing for the rest of Russia, as has often\r\nbeen the case in history.\r\n\r\nThis is also the chance of domestic industry and services. With\r\nunemployment up, wage costs are down by half. So are rent and security\r\ncosts and other overhead. Many good people are available today at a\r\nreasonable price. Companies have rationalized, cut the fat, sacked\r\nunneeded people, become lean and mean. They are fast becoming\r\ncompetitive in their own markets and, later on, perhaps, in export\r\nmarkets.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, imports are down by 45%. Domestic firms face much less\r\ncompetition, on the one hand, and less choosy clients, on the other\r\nhand. This is their chance to capture market share. Russian businesses\r\nare used to operating without a banking system, or in hyperinflation.\r\nForeigners are not. Shops will prefer to stock cheaper domestically\r\nproduced goods. Both product quality and the attention to the\r\nconsumer's needs and demands need to improve. But the prize is\r\nenormous: control of the Russian market.\r\n\r\nBut is there a Russian market? This is the only cloud in the silver\r\nlining. Russia is being regionalized, broken down. The movement of both\r\npeople and goods is gradually restricted. The fragmentation of a\r\nhitherto unified market is detrimental. This is the real risk facing\r\nRussia. Whatever the POLITICAL arrangements - the economy must remain\r\nunited. The various oblasts, mini-states and fiefdoms are simply not\r\neconomically viable on their own.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Article published November 23, 1998 in \"The New Presence\")\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMF - Kill or Cure\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was the title of the cover page of the prestigious magazine, \"The\r\nEconomist\" in its issue of 10/1/98. The more involved the IMF gets in\r\nthe world economy - the more controversy surrounds it. Economies in\r\ntransition, emerging economies, developing countries and, lately, even\r\nAsian Tigers all feel the brunt of the IMF recipes. All are not too\r\nhappy with it, all are loudly complaining. Some economists regard this\r\nas a sign of the proper functioning of the International Monetary Fund\r\n(IMF) - others spot some justice in some of the complaints.\r\n\r\nThe IMF was established in 1944 as part of the Bretton Woods agreement.\r\nOriginally, it was conceived as the monetary arm of the UN, an agency.\r\nIt encompassed 29 countries but excluded the losers in World War II,\r\nGermany and Japan. The exclusion of the losers in the Cold war from the\r\nWTO is reminiscent of what happened then: in both cases, the USA called\r\nthe shots and dictated the composition of the membership of\r\ninternational organization in accordance with its predilections.\r\n\r\nToday, the IMF numbers 182 member-countries and boasts \"equity\" (own\r\nfinancial means) of 200 billion USD (measured by Special Drawing\r\nRights, SDR, pegged at 1.35 USD each). It employs 2600 workers from 110\r\ncountries. It is truly international.\r\n\r\nThe IMF has a few statutory purposes. They are splashed across its\r\nStatute and its official publications. The criticism relates to the\r\nimplementation - not to the noble goals. It also relates to turf\r\noccupied by the IMF without any mandate to do so.\r\n\r\nThe IMF is supposed to:\r\n\r\nA. Promote international monetary cooperation;\r\n\r\nB. Expand international trade (a role which reverted now to the\r\nWTO);\r\n\r\nC. Establish a multilateral system of payments;\r\n\r\nD. Assist countries with Balance of Payments (BOP) difficulties\r\nunder adequate safeguards;\r\n\r\nE. Lessen the duration and the degree of disequilibrium in the\r\ninternational BOPS of member countries;\r\n\r\nF. Promote exchange rate stability, the signing of orderly\r\nexchange agreements and the avoidance of competitive exchange\r\ndepreciation.\r\n\r\nThe IMF tries to juggle all these goals in the thinning air of the\r\nglobal capital markets. It does so through three types of activities:\r\n\r\nSurveillance\r\n\r\nThe IMF regularly monitors exchange rate policies, the general economic\r\nsituation and other economic policies. It does so through the (to some\r\ncountries, ominous) mechanism of \"consultation\" (with the countries'\r\nmonetary and fiscal authorities). The famed (and dreaded) World\r\nEconomic Outlook (WEO) report amalgamates the individual country\r\nresults into a coherent picture of multilateral surveillance.\r\n\r\nSometimes, countries, which have no on-going interaction with the IMF\r\nand do not use its assistance do ask it to intervene, at least by way\r\nof grading and evaluating their economies. The last decade saw the\r\ntransformation of the IMF into an unofficial (and, incidentally,\r\nnon-mandated) country credit rating agency. Its stamp of approval can\r\nmean the difference between the availability of credits to a given\r\ncountry - or its absence. At best, a bad review by the IMF imposes\r\nfinancial penalties on the delinquent country in the form of higher\r\ninterest rates and charges payable on its international borrowings.\r\n\r\nThe Precautionary Agreement is one such rating device. It serves to\r\nboost international confidence in an economy. Another contraption is\r\nthe Monitoring Agreement, which sets economic benchmarks (some say,\r\nhurdles) under a shadow economic program designed by the IMF. Attaining\r\nthese benchmarks confers reliability upon the economic policies of the\r\ncountry monitored.\r\n\r\nFinancial Assistance\r\n\r\nWhere surveillance ends, financial assistance begins. It is extended to\r\nmembers with BOP difficulties to support adjustment and reform policies\r\nand economic agendas. Through 31/7/97, for instance, the IMF extended\r\n23 billion USD of such help to more than 50 countries and the\r\noutstanding credit portfolio stood at 60 billion USD. The surprising\r\nthing is that 90% of these amounts were borrowed by relatively well-off\r\ncountries in the West, contrary to the image of the IMF as a lender of\r\nlast resort to shabby countries in despair.\r\n\r\nHidden behind a jungle of acronyms, an unprecedented system of\r\ninternational finance evolves relentlessly. They will be reviewed in\r\ndetail later.\r\n\r\nTechnical Assistance\r\n\r\nThe last type of activity of the IMF is Technical Assistance, mainly in\r\nthe design and implementation of fiscal and monetary policy and in\r\nbuilding the institutions to see them through successfully (e.g.,\r\nCentral Banks). The IMF also teaches the uninitiated how to handle and\r\naccount for transactions that they are doing with the IMF. Another\r\nbranch of this activity is the collection of statistical data - where\r\nthe IMF is forced to rely on mostly inadequate and antiquated systems\r\nof data collection and analysis. Lately, the IMF stepped up its\r\nactivities in the training of government and non-government (NGO)\r\nofficials. This is in line with the new credo of the World Bank:\r\nwithout the right, functioning, less corrupt institutions - no policy\r\nwill succeed, no matter how right.\r\n\r\nFrom the narrow point of view of its financial mechanisms (as distinct\r\nfrom its policies) - the IMF is an intriguing and hitherto successful\r\nexample of international collaboration and crisis prevention or\r\namelioration (=crisis management). The principle is deceptively simple:\r\nmember countries purchase the currencies of other member countries\r\n(USA, Germany, the UK, etc.). Alternatively, the draw SDRs and convert\r\nthem to the aforementioned \"hard\" currencies. They pay for all this\r\nwith their own, local and humble currencies. The catch is that they\r\nhave to buy their own currencies back from the IMF after a prescribed\r\nperiod of time. As with every bank, they also have to pay charges and\r\ncommissions related to the withdrawal.\r\n\r\nA country can draw up to its \"Reserve Tranche Position\". This is the\r\nunused part of its quota (every country has a quota which is based on\r\nits participation in the equity of the IMF and on its needs). The quota\r\nis supposed to be used only in extreme BOP distress. Credits that the\r\ncountry received from the IMF are not deducted from its quota (because,\r\nostensibly, they will be paid back by it to the IMF). But the IMF holds\r\nthe local currency of the country (given to it in exchange for hard\r\ncurrency or SDRs). These holdings are deducted from the quota because\r\nthey are not credit to be repaid but the result of an exchange\r\ntransaction.\r\n\r\nA country can draw no more than 25% of its quota in the first tranche\r\nof a loan that it receives from the IMF. The first tranche is available\r\nto any country, which demonstrates efforts to overcome its BOP\r\nproblems. The language of this requirement is so vague that it renders\r\nvirtually all the members eligible to receive the first instalment.\r\n\r\nOther tranches are more difficult to obtain (as Russia and Zimbabwe can\r\ntestify): the country must show successful compliance with agreed\r\neconomic plans and meet performance criteria regarding its budget\r\ndeficit and monetary gauges (for instance credit ceilings in the\r\neconomy as a whole). The tranches that follow the first one are also\r\nphased. All this (welcome and indispensable) disciplining is waived in\r\ncase of Emergency Assistance - BOP needs which arise due to natural\r\ndisasters or as the result of an armed conflict. In such cases, the\r\ncountry can immediately draw up to 25% of its quota subject only to\r\n\"cooperation\" with the IMF - but not subject to meeting performance\r\ncriteria. The IMF also does not shy away from helping countries meet\r\ntheir debt service obligations. Countries can draw money to retire and\r\nreduce burdening old debts or merely to service it.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to find a path in the jungle of acronyms, which sprouted\r\nin the wake of the formation of the IMF. It imposes tough guidelines on\r\nthose unfortunate enough to require its help: a drastic reduction in\r\ninflation, cutting back imports and enhancing exports. The IMF is\r\nfunded by the rich industrialized countries: the USA alone contributes\r\nclose to 18% to its resources annually. Following the 1994-5 crisis in\r\nMexico (in which the IMF a crucial healing role) - the USA led a round\r\nof increases in the contributions of the well-to-do members (G7) to its\r\ncoffers. This became known as the Halifax-I round. Halifax-II looks all\r\nbut inevitable, following the costly turmoil in Southeast Asia. The\r\nlatter dilapidated the IMF's resources more than all the previous\r\ncrises combined.\r\n\r\nAt first, the Stand By Arrangement (SBA) was set up. It still operates\r\nas a short-term BOP assistance financing facility designed to offset\r\ntemporary or cyclical BOP deficits. It is typically available for\r\nperiods of between 12 to 18 months and released gradually, on a\r\nquarterly basis to the recipient member. Its availability depends\r\nheavily on the fulfilment of performance conditions and on periodic\r\nprogram reviews. The country must pay back (=repurchase its own\r\ncurrency and pay for it with hard currencies) in 3.25 to 5 years after\r\neach original purchase.\r\n\r\nThis was followed by the General Agreement to Borrow (GAB) - a\r\nframework reference for all future facilities and by the CFF\r\n(Compensatory Financing Facility). The latter was augmented by loans\r\navailable to countries to defray the rising costs of basic edibles and\r\nfoodstuffs (cereals). The two merged to become CCFF (Compensatory and\r\nContingency Financing Facility) - intended to compensate members with\r\nshortfalls in export earnings attributable to circumstances beyond\r\ntheir control and to help them to maintain adjustment programs in the\r\nface of external shocks. It also helps them to meet the rising costs of\r\ncereal imports and other external contingencies (some of them arising\r\nfrom previous IMF lending!). This credit is also available for a period\r\nof 3.25 to 5 years.\r\n\r\n1971 was an important year in the history of the world's financial\r\nmarkets. The Bretton Woods Agreements were cancelled but instead of\r\npulling the carpet under the proverbial legs of the IMF - it served to\r\nstrengthen its position. Under the Smithsonian Agreement, it was put in\r\ncharge of maintaining the central exchange rates (though inside much\r\nwider bands). A committee of 20 members was set up to agree on a new\r\nworld monetary system (known by its unfortunate acronym, CRIMS). Its\r\nrecommendations led to the creation of the EFF (extended Financing\r\nFacility), which provided, for the first time, MEDIUM term assistance\r\nto members with BOP difficulties, which resulted from structural or\r\nmacro-economic (rather than conjectural) economic changes. It served to\r\nsupport medium term (3 years) programs. In other respects, it is a\r\nreplica of the SBA, except that that the repayment (=the repurchase, in\r\nIMF jargon) is in 4.5-10 years.\r\n\r\nThe 70s witnessed a proliferation of multilateral assistance programs.\r\nThe IMF set up the SA (Subsidy Account), which assisted members to\r\novercome the two destructive oil price shocks. An oil facility was\r\nformed to ameliorate the reverberating economic shock waves. A Trust\r\nFund (TF) extended BOP assistance to developing member countries,\r\nutilizing the profits from gold sales. To top all these, an SFF\r\n(Supplementary Financing Facility) was established.\r\n\r\nDuring the 1980s, the IMF had a growing role in various adjustment\r\nprocesses and in the financing of payments imbalances. It began to use\r\na basket of 5 major currencies. It began to borrow funds for its\r\npurposes - the contributions did not meet its expanding roles.\r\n\r\nIt got involved in the Latin American Debt Crisis - namely, in problems\r\nof debt servicing. It is to this period that we can trace the emergence\r\nof the New IMF: invigorated, powerful, omnipresent, omniscient, mildly\r\nthreatening - the monetary police of the global economic scene.\r\n\r\nThe SAF (Structural Adjustment Facility) was created. Its role was to\r\nprovide BOP assistance on concessional terms to low income, developing\r\ncountries (Macedonia benefited from its successor, ESAF). Five years\r\nlater, following the now unjustly infamous Louvre Accord, which dealt\r\nwith the stabilization of exchange rates), it was extended to become\r\nESAF (Extended Structural Adjustment Facility). The idea was to support\r\nlow-income members, which undertake a strong 3-year macroeconomic and\r\nstructural program intended to improve their BOP and to foster growth -\r\nproviding that they are enduring protracted BOP problems. ESAF loans\r\nfinance 3-year programs with a subsidized symbolic interest rate of\r\n0.5% per annum. The country has 5 years grace and the loan matures in\r\n10 years. The economic assessment of the country is assessed quarterly\r\nand biannually. Macedonia is only one of 79 countries eligible to\r\nreceive ESAF funds.\r\n\r\nIn 1989, the IMF started linking support for debt reduction strategies\r\nof member countries to sustained medium term adjustment programs with\r\nstrong elements of structural reforms and with access to IMF resources\r\nfor the express purposes of retiring old debts, reducing outstanding\r\nborrowing from foreign sources or otherwise servicing debt without\r\nresorting to rescheduling it. To these ends, the IMF created the STF\r\n(Systemic Transformation Facility - also used by Macedonia). It was a\r\ntemporary outfit, which expired in April 1995. It provided financial\r\nassistance to countries, which faced BOP difficulties, which arose from\r\na transformation (transition) from planned economies to market ones.\r\nOnly countries with what were judged by the IMF to have been severe\r\ndisruptions in trade and payments arrangements benefited from it. It\r\nhad to be repaid in 4.5-10 years.\r\n\r\nIn 1994, the Madrid Declaration set different goals for different\r\nvarieties of economies. Industrial economies were supposed to emphasize\r\nsustained growth, reduction in unemployment and the prevention of a\r\nresurgence of by now subdued inflation. Developing countries were\r\nallocated the role of extending their growth. Countries in transition\r\nhad to engage in bold stabilization and reform to win the Fund's\r\napproval. A new category was created, in the best of acronym tradition:\r\nHIPCs (Heavily Indebted Poor Countries). In 1997 New Arrangements to\r\nBorrow (NAB) were set in motion. They became the first and principal\r\nrecourse in case that IMF supplementary resources were needed. No one\r\nimagined how quickly these would be exhausted and how far sighted these\r\narrangement have proven to be. No one predicted the area either:\r\nSoutheast Asia.\r\n\r\nDespite these momentous structural changes in the ways in which the IMF\r\nextends its assistance, the details of the decision-making processes\r\nhave not been altered for more than half a century. The IMF has a Board\r\nof Governors. It includes 1 Governor (plus 1 Alternative Governor) from\r\nevery member country (normally, the Minister of Finance or the Governor\r\nof the Central Bank of that member). They meet annually (in the autumn)\r\nand coordinate their meeting with that of the World Bank.\r\n\r\nThe Board of Governors oversees the operation of a Board of Executive\r\nDirectors, which looks after the mundane, daily business. It is\r\ncomposed of the Managing Director (Michel Camdessus from 1987 till\r\n2000) as the Chairman of the Board and 24 Executive Directors appointed\r\nor elected by big members or groups of members. There is also an\r\nInterim Committee of the International Monetary System.\r\n\r\nThe members' voting rights are determined by their quota which (as we\r\nsaid) is determined by their contributions and by their needs. The USA\r\nis the biggest gun, followed by Germany, Japan, France and the UK.\r\n\r\nThere is little dispute that the IMF is a big, indispensable, success.\r\nWithout it the world monetary system would have entered phases of\r\ncontraction much more readily. Without the assistance that it extends\r\nand the bitter medicines that it administers - many countries would\r\nhave been in an even worse predicament than they are already. It\r\nimposes monetary and fiscal discipline, it forces governments to plan\r\nand think, it imposes painful adjustments and reforms. It serves as a\r\nconvenient scapegoat: the politicians can blame it for the economic\r\nwoes that their voters (or citizens) endure. It is very useful. Lately,\r\nit lends credibility to countries and manages crisis situations (though\r\nstill not very skilfully).\r\n\r\nThis scapegoat role constitutes the basis for the first criticism.\r\nPeople the world over tend to hide behind the IMF leaf and blame the\r\nresults of their incompetence and corruption on it. Where a market\r\neconomy could have provided a swifter and more resolute adjustment -\r\nthe diversion of scarce human and financial resources to negotiating\r\nwith the IMF seems to prolong the agony. The abrogation of\r\nresponsibility by decision makers poses a moral hazard: if successful -\r\nthe credit goes to the politicians, if failing - the IMF is always to\r\nblame. Rage and other negative feeling, which would have normally\r\nbrought about real, transparent, corruption-free, efficient market\r\neconomy are vented and deflected. The IMF money encourages corrupt and\r\ninefficient spending because it cannot really be controlled and\r\nmonitored (at least not on a real time basis). Also, the more resources\r\ngovernments have - the more will be lost to corruption and\r\ninefficiency. Zimbabwe is a case in point: following a dispute\r\nregarding an austerity package dictated by the IMF (the government did\r\nnot feel like cutting government spending to that extent) - the country\r\nwas cut off from IMF funding. The results were surprising: with less\r\nfinancing from the IMF (and as a result - from donor countries, as\r\nwell) - the government was forced to rationalize and to restrict its\r\nspending. The IMF would not have achieved these results because its\r\ncontrol mechanisms are flawed: they rely to heavily on local, official\r\ninput and they are remote (from Washington). They are also underfunded.\r\n\r\nDespite these shortcomings, the IMF assumed two roles, which were not\r\nhistorically identified with it. It became a country credit risk-rating\r\nagency. The absence of an IMF seal of approval could - and usually does\r\n- mean financial suffocation. No banks or donor countries will extend\r\ncredit to a country lacking the IMF's endorsement. On the other hand,\r\nas authority (to rate) is shifted - so does responsibility. The IMF\r\nbecame a super-guarantor of the debts of both the public and private\r\nsectors. This encourages irresponsible lending and investments (why\r\nworry, the IMF will bail me out in case of default). This is the \"Moral\r\nHazard\": the safety net is fast being transformed into a licence to\r\ngamble. The profits accrue to the gambler - the losses to the IMF. This\r\ndoes not encourage prudence or discipline.\r\n\r\nThe IMF is too restricted both in its ability to operate and in its\r\nability to conceptualise and to innovate. It is too stale: a scroll in\r\nthe age of the video clip. It, therefore, resorts to prescribing the\r\nsame medicine of austerity to all the country patients, which are\r\nsuffering from a myriad of economic diseases. No one would call a\r\ndoctor who uniformly administers penicillin - a good doctor and, yet,\r\nthis, exactly is what the IMF is doing. And it is doing so with utter\r\ndisregard and ignorance of the local social, cultural (even economic)\r\nrealities. Add to this the fact that the IMF's ability to influence the\r\nfinancial markets in an age of globalisation is dubious (to use a gross\r\nunderstatement - the daily turnover in the foreign exchange markets\r\nalone is 6 times the total equity of this organization). The result is\r\nfiascos like South Korea where a 60 billion USD aid package was\r\nconsumed in days without providing any discernible betterment of the\r\neconomic situation. More and more, the IMF looks anachronistic (not to\r\nsay archaic) and its goals untenable.\r\n\r\nThe IMF also displays the whole gamut of problems which plague every\r\nbureaucratic institution: discrimination (why help Mexico and not\r\nBulgaria - is it because it shares no border with the USA),\r\npoliticisation (South Korean officials complained that the IMF\r\nofficials were trying to smuggle trade concessions to the USA in an\r\notherwise totally financial package of measures) and too much red tape.\r\nBut this was to be expected of an organization this size and with so\r\nmuch power.\r\n\r\nThe medicine is no better than the doctor or, for that matter, than the\r\ndisease that it is intended to cure.\r\n\r\nThe IMF forces governments to restrict flows of capital and goods.\r\nReducing budget deficits belongs to the former - reducing balance of\r\npayments deficits, to the latter. Consequently, government find\r\nthemselves between the hard rock of not complying with the IMF\r\nperformance demands (and criteria) - and the hammer of needing its\r\nassistance more and more often, getting hooked on it.\r\n\r\nThe crusader-economist Michel Chossudowski wrote once that the IMF's\r\nadjustment policies \"trigger the destruction of whole economies\". With\r\nall due respect (Chossudowski conducted research in 100 countries\r\nregarding this issue), this looks a trifle overblown. Overall, the IMF\r\nhas beneficial accounts, which cannot be discounted so off-handedly.\r\nBut the process that he describes is, to some extent, true:\r\n\r\nDevaluation (forced on the country by the IMF in order to encourage its\r\nexports and to stabilize its currency) leads to an increase in the\r\ngeneral price level (also known as inflation). In other words:\r\nimmediately after a devaluation, the prices go up (this happened in\r\nMacedonia and led to a doubling of the inflation which persisted before\r\nthe 16% devaluation in July 1997). High prices burden businesses and\r\nincrease their default rates. The banks increase their interest rates\r\nto compensate for the higher risk (=higher default rate) and to claw\r\nback part of the inflation (=to maintain the same REAL interest rates\r\nas before the increase in inflation). Wages are never fully indexed.\r\nThe salaries lag after the cost of living and the purchasing power of\r\nhouseholds is eroded. Taxes fall as a result of a decrease in wages and\r\nthe collapse of many businesses and either the budget is cruelly cut\r\n(austerity and scaling back of social services) or the budget deficit\r\nincreases (because the government spends more than it collects in\r\ntaxes). Another bad option (though rarely used) is to raise taxes or\r\nimprove the collection mechanisms. Rising manufacturing costs (fuel and\r\nfreight are denominated in foreign currencies and so do many of the\r\ntradable inputs) lead to pricing out of many of the local firms (their\r\nprices become too high for the local markets to afford). A flood of\r\ncheaper imports ensues and the comparative advantages of the country\r\nsuffer. Finally, the creditors take over the national economic policy\r\n(which is reminiscent of darker, colonial times).\r\n\r\nAnd if this sounds familiar it is because this is exactly what is\r\nhappening in Macedonia today. Communism to some extent was replaced by\r\nIMF-ism. In an age of the death of ideologies, this is a poor - and\r\ndangerous - choice. The country spends 500 million USD annually on\r\ntotally unnecessary consumption (cars, jam, detergents). It gets this\r\nmoney from the IMF and from donor countries but an awful price: the\r\nloss of its hard earned autonomy and freedom. No country is independent\r\nif the strings of its purse are held by others.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Article written in January, 1998)\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe IMF Deconstructed\r\n\r\n\r\nA Dialogue with Mr. Tom Rodwell\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following is a standard IMF document, taken from its own website.\r\nUnderlined phrases are related to categories A and/or B (see below).\r\nThe phrases here are general examples as part of general criticism of\r\nthe ideological tone and \"aesthetic\" of the IMF. This dialogue is a\r\ncombination of philosophy and economics: does/can the IMF (or any\r\norganization) \"facilitate the expansion and balanced growth of\r\ninternational trade?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe IMF is the cornerstone and centrepiece of the financial\r\narchitecture of the world. Long a sacred cow, it has lately become the\r\neye of a controversy. Its prescriptions to ailing countries as diverse\r\nas Zimbabwe and Russia have, at times, proven to be inadequate, some\r\nsay: ruinous. The IMF is a result of an ideology and its instrument.\r\nThis is clearly revealed in its intentionally vaguely phrased\r\ndocuments. Tom and Sam, a philosopher/journalist/composer and a\r\nphilosopher and physicist turned economist, try to read between the\r\nlines (in the best of East European traditions...).\r\n\r\nThe IMF:\r\n\r\nStatutory Purposes\r\n\r\nThe IMF was created to promote international monetary co-operation; to\r\nfacilitate the expansion and balanced growth of international trade; to\r\npromote exchange stability; to assist in the establishment of a\r\nmultilateral system of payments; to make its general resources\r\ntemporarily available to its members experiencing balance of payments\r\ndifficulties under adequate safeguards; and to shorten the duration and\r\nlessen the degree of disequilibrium in the international balances of\r\npayments of members.\r\n\r\nAreas of Activity\r\n\r\nSurveillance is the process by which the IMF appraises its members'\r\nexchange rate policies within the framework of a comprehensive analysis\r\nof the general economic situation and the policy strategy of each\r\nmember. The IMF fulfils its surveillance responsibilities through:\r\nannual bilateral Article IV consultations with individual countries;\r\nmultilateral surveillance twice a year in the context of its World\r\nEconomic Outlook (WEO) exercise; and precautionary arrangements,\r\nenhanced surveillance, and program monitoring, which provide a member\r\nwith close monitoring from the IMF in the absence of the use of IMF\r\nresources. (Precautionary arrangements serve to boost international\r\nconfidence in a member's policies. Program monitoring may include the\r\nsetting of benchmarks under a shadow program, but it does not\r\nconstitute a formal IMF endorsement.)\r\n\r\nIMF IDEOLOGICAL TONE\r\n\r\nTom:\r\n\r\nThe nature of the IMF is inextricably linked with its controlling\r\nmember state and staff's economic and political viewpoints. The IMF\r\ntalks about itself, and about economic/political phenomena generally,\r\nin precisely the same terms. The kind of economics it discusses is one\r\nof authority, monitoring, and, dare I say it, intervention. While the\r\nIMF allegedly intends to promote \"international monetary co-operation\"\r\nand to \"facilitate the expansion and balanced growth of international\r\ntrade\" (standard free-market shibboleths), it consistently refers to\r\n\"enhanced surveillance\", \"close monitoring\", and \"precautionary\r\narrangements\". Orwellian undertones are hardly muffled.\r\n\r\nSam:\r\n\r\nThe IMF has yet to adopt the \"client-orientated\" approach. It harbours\r\ndeep (and oft-justified) distrust of the willingness of governments to\r\nblindly follow its dictates. It is a paranoid organization, based on\r\nauthoritarian techniques of \"negotiations\" and \"agreement\". Euphemisms\r\nrule. Normally, the IMF holds \"consultations\" with the host\r\ngovernments. These are rather one-sided affairs. The governments are\r\nneedy and impoverished ones. They lack the cadre of educated people\r\nneeded in order to truly engage the IMF in constructive discourse. They\r\nare intimidated by the bullying tactics of the IMF and of its\r\nemissaries. The tone is imperial and impatient.\r\n\r\nTom:\r\n\r\nThe IMF clearly sees itself as the authority on international\r\ndevelopment ideology. International development becomes an ideological\r\nconstruction, with subsets of subjective terms: free trade, financial\r\ncontact, and economic vision. Many of these terms are defined in such a\r\nway that they enframe that which they discuss. The ideological position\r\nof the influential members is often significantly different from the\r\ndeveloping countries. Sadly, the ideology only becomes reality when it\r\nis part of every day life in the developing nations.\r\n\r\nSam:\r\n\r\nWorse still, the IMF's language is riddled with contradictions in terms\r\nand logical fallacies. Let us review a few: International monetary\r\nco-operation in IMF lingo means exchange (rate) stability. But with\r\nsuch stability the expansion and balanced growth of international trade\r\nis not achievable. Trade is based on dynamic exchange rate disparities.\r\nMoreover, there is nothing inherently wrong in such dynamism. The\r\nchanging disparities reflect the relative advantages of the countries\r\ninvolved. In a world of fixed exchange rates - trade stagnates. And\r\nwhat is \"balanced\" growth anyhow? Trade has been growing at 3-5%\r\nannually for a few years now. Is this balanced, overdone or\r\ninsufficient, as some free trade zealots cry out?\r\n\r\nAdditionally, a regime of stable exchange rates won't go far towards\r\nfacilitating the second result: to shorten the duration and lessen the\r\ndegree of disequilibrium in the international balances of payments of\r\nmembers. If a country runs a gigantic balance of payments deficit but\r\nis not permitted by the IMF to devalue its currency, in the name of\r\nexchange rate stability - its balance of payments is only likely to\r\nworsen. Take Macedonia: with a 14% of GDP deficit in its BOP - it MUST\r\ndevalue and URGENTLY. Its currency is HEAVILY overvalued and the whole\r\neconomy is deflating. Yet, the IMF is about to repeat there the same\r\ngrave error it committed in Russia: to protect the currency, the whole\r\nsystem is drained of liquidity (demonetised), interest rates are kept\r\ninsanely high and the balance of payments deficit skyrockets, until the\r\ninevitable collapse. If the IMF is interested in self-perpetuating\r\ncrisis situations in order to preserve its clout - it is doing a fine\r\njob indeed.\r\n\r\nThe IMF was never authorized to rate the creditworthiness of its\r\nshareholders (=the countries). It is acting ultra vires in providing\r\nclean or soiled bills of financial health. Its ability to strangle a\r\ncountry financially if it does not comply with its programmes - no\r\nmatter what the social or economic costs are - is very worrying.\r\n\r\nLANGUAGE\r\n\r\nTom:\r\n\r\nThe language in the IMF document can be roughly divided into two\r\nsections.\r\n\r\nA Phrases concerning the-history-role/activities-nature of the IMF B\r\nPhrases concerning - subjective economic and political concepts - local\r\npolicy - international policy.\r\n\r\nHere's my summary of the kind of language used:\r\n\r\n1. Quasi-intellectual terms (\"big words for a dismal science\"),\r\ne.g. disequilibrium, comprehensive analysis, policy strategy;\r\n\r\n2. Spin-doctoring euphemisms, e.g. promote, facilitate, balance,\r\nco-operation, safeguards, monitoring, responsibilities, precautionary\r\narrangements, endorsement, benchmarks. This also includes intimidating\r\nterms such as \"surveillance\";\r\n\r\n3. Distancing terms, e.g. members, general economic situation,\r\npolicy strategy.\r\n\r\n(1) Is simply pretension. The average \"comprehensive analysis\"\r\nundertaken by the IMF is often curiously selective and self-serving.\r\n\r\nSam:\r\n\r\nNot to mention cursory \"kangaroo-court\" economic judgements replete\r\nwith clear contempt and disregard for the \"natives\". The latter are\r\nheld to be cheats who are merely trying to extort as much money as they\r\ncan and probably stash it in Swiss bank accounts (private ones,\r\nneedless to say).\r\n\r\nTom:\r\n\r\n(2) Is the most obnoxious section. These phrases mislead. They paint a\r\npicture of the stability and democracy that supposedly is Western\r\ncapitalism. They paint an image of the IMF as a fair, unbiased, caring,\r\nand democratic organisation. These phrases also confuse in that they\r\nconnect \"nice terms\" (like balance, co-operation and safeguards) with\r\ncomplicated and subjective economic terms. Thus the language often\r\nfunctions as a \"pacifier\", or perhaps as a \"chaser\", softening the blow\r\nof the \"hard stuff\".\r\n\r\n(3) Indicates the insular attitude of the IMF. Their \"grand scheme\" is\r\napparently removed from localised activities and concerns.\r\n\r\nSam:\r\n\r\nThere is one place, which absolutely complies with the IMF utopia.\r\nThere is no inflation there. People do not particularly care if the\r\nexchange rate never changes or what is the outlandish level of interest\r\nrates needed to ensure this eerie stability. It is the cemetery.\r\n\r\nThe IMF's deadly sin, yet to yield its grapes of wrath, is not to\r\nunderstand that economics is a branch of psychology and should be at\r\nthe service of humans and society. When setting economic goals one must\r\nalways act with pragmatism and compassion. In the realm of humans, to\r\nbe compassionate IS to be pragmatic. Otherwise, reality is bound to\r\nfrustrate the most rigorous planning. If social costs are not accounted\r\nfor - unemployment will bring about crime and a black market, which\r\nwill render the official market and its statistics meaningless, for\r\ninstance. If exchange rate stability supported by inanely high interest\r\nrates prevails over the goals of industrial reconstruction and\r\nexport-enhancement, the result is erosion of the very fabric of\r\nsociety. Lack of liquidity translates into a lack of trust in fellow\r\ncitizens and in institutions. If public expenditures are harnessed too\r\nstrenuously - corruption will flourish. The IMF's propensity to provide\r\na \"catchall\" one-measure-fits-all panacea is nothing short of\r\nshortsighted and disastrous. It cannot be that the same financial\r\nrecipe will apply to Pakistan, Macedonia, Estonia and Russia. Yet, a\r\nclose scrutiny of the four IMF programmes imposed upon these countries\r\n(Estonia wriggled out) - demonstrates striking similarities. It is a\r\nfact that there are conflicting CAPITALIST economic models. Not because\r\nhuman nature is so diverse - and it is - but because different people\r\nhave different preferences. Americans prefer profits and self-reliance\r\nto social justice. Not so the French. Paradoxically, this is exactly\r\nwhy markets exist: to trade in disparate preferences. The IMF is a\r\ncentral planning agency but as opposed to previous models it believes\r\nthat it is omniscient - and knows that it is omnipotent.\r\n\r\nTom:\r\n\r\nThe IMF's desire to paint a kind of stasis on the world economy is, as\r\nyou have said, a kind of religious-ideological defence mechanism. The\r\nlanguage employed by the IMF is an attempt to give form to the\r\nhaphazard and contradictory nature of international trade and\r\ndevelopment. This language functions in a similar way to their\r\npolicies, in that both seek to describe and promote a uniform\r\nconcept/practice of international economics.\r\n\r\nThe reference to economics as a branch of psychology is spot-on. It is\r\nignorant, unethical and unworkable to attempt to impose or promote any\r\nkind of exclusive and conformist concept of \"the economy\". Indeed, the\r\nIMF's bizarre language and policies reveal a mistaken view (commonly\r\nheld) that there is such a single practice or entity called \"The\r\nEconomy\", or \"International Trade\". Absolutist and limiting concepts of\r\neconomy (communism, now capitalism) are increasingly being shown to be\r\nunworkable. The language used by the IMF is evidence of the\r\nimpractical, restrictive and unethical nature of an elitist\r\nconcept/practice of economics.\r\n\r\nFINAL STATEMENT\r\n\r\nTom:\r\n\r\nThe IMF is a part of the industry of \"trade\", \"development\", and\r\n\"economics\" in general. This criticism of the language found in their\r\npromotional documents is, in some ways, a criticism of the\r\naforementioned \"economics industry\" in general. When I first read the\r\nIMF's comments/reports, I was struck by the combination of arrogance\r\nand defensiveness (in a tone of barely muted desperation). I now\r\nbelieve that these documents were written with the first whiff of fear\r\nin the NYC air-conditioned office ambience. No doubt that those miners,\r\nsteel workers, farmers, and manufacturers whose own industries were\r\nflattened by free trade hysteria will feel a tiny degree of\r\nsatisfaction, if we really are seeing the decline of the \"economics\r\nindustry\".\r\n\r\nThe IMF is unethical because it espouses an abstract concept \"free\r\ntrade\" that influences the complex process of \"development\" (too often\r\ndefined with insufficient complexity) while being unconcerned with\r\nspecific and local realities and interactions. It is simply too\r\nabstract: international development is not assisted on a truly local\r\nlevel by investment in the military, state, or heavy industry. It is\r\nridiculous for a third world country to build massive steel-plants, or\r\nallow foreign companies to extract vast amounts of timber or oil, when\r\nlocal people are concerned with finding clean drinking water. This\r\nabstraction criticism stands for the entire \"economics industry\", and\r\nwill continue to do so while it has an insufficiently perceptive and\r\ncomplex understanding of localised realities.\r\n\r\nThe language of economics is murky, and our criticism of it will remain\r\njustified as long as the IMF (et al) produce officious and misleading\r\ndocuments. The practice of economics is also murky, and our criticism\r\nof it too will remain justified as long as policies that are illogical,\r\nimpractical and unethical are produced and enforced.\r\n\r\nSam:\r\n\r\nThe IMF is an essential institution. There must exist a multilateral\r\norganization geared towards the maintenance of the marketplace itself.\r\nBut the IMF should get rid of its Multiple Personality Disorder. It\r\nmust first decide WHAT is it: a lender of last resort? A\r\ncreditworthiness-rating agency, sort of an ominous Moody's? A\r\nmissionary organization, preaching a particular brand of the religion\r\nknown as capitalism? A commercially-orientated, return-on-investment\r\nbased financial organization? Dumping grounds for aging politicians and\r\nthird-rate bankers doing the USA's bidding? Whatever the definition, it\r\nis bound to be far superior to the current muddled state of affairs.\r\n\r\nSecond, the IMF must maintain transparency. It controls vast resources.\r\nIt is prone to be inefficient (not to say corrupt). Transparency\r\nhumbles, ensures the injection of fresh intellectual blood, improves\r\nperformance, and gives taxpayers a good feeling. The IMF needs to be\r\nhumbled. Its actions have been politicised lately. It intervenes in the\r\ninternal affairs of dozens of sovereign, reasonably managed countries -\r\nand its intervention is not confined to matters economic. It develops\r\nan internal \"Organizational cult\" (we know best and always). It is one\r\nof the most rigid and intellectually handicapped organizations in the\r\nworld, yet it considers itself a bastion of economic ingenuity and\r\nrighteousness. Delusions of grandeur are dangerous on such a scale.\r\n\r\nThird, the revamped, no-longer-haughty, IMF must be able to fine tune\r\nto different social and cultural constraints in different spots of the\r\nworld. It must strive at least to BE SEEN to be trying to minimize the\r\nsocial costs of its often-botched plans. It must not behave as a\r\ncolonial power, which it often does. It must establish trust rather\r\nthan impose discipline. Otherwise, it stands no chance to laugh last.\r\nActually, it stands no chance even to survive.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Article published January 4, 1999 in \"The New Presence\")\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinancial Crisis, Global Capital Flows and the International Financial\r\nArchitecture\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe recent upheavals in the world financial markets were quelled by the\r\nimmediate intervention of both international financial institutions\r\nsuch as the IMF and of domestic ones in the developed countries, such\r\nas the Federal Reserve in the USA. The danger seems to have passed,\r\nthough recent tremors in South Korea, Brazil and Taiwan do not augur\r\nwell. We may face yet another crisis of the same or a larger magnitude\r\nmomentarily.\r\n\r\nWhat are the lessons that we can derive from the last crisis to avoid\r\nthe next?\r\n\r\nThe first lesson, it would seem, is that short term and long-term\r\ncapital flows are two disparate phenomena with very little in common.\r\nThe former is speculative and technical in nature and has very little\r\nto do with fundamental realities. The latter is investment oriented and\r\ncommitted to the increasing of the welfare and wealth of its new\r\ndomicile. It is, therefore, wrong to talk about \"global capital flows\".\r\nThere are investments (including even long term portfolio investments\r\nand venture capital) - and there is speculative, \"hot\" money. While\r\n\"hot money\" is very useful as a lubricant on the wheels of liquid\r\ncapital markets in rich countries - it can be destructive in less\r\nliquid, immature economies or in economies in transition.\r\n\r\nThe two phenomena should be accorded a different treatment. While\r\nlong-term capital flows should be completely liberalized, encouraged\r\nand welcomed - the short term, \"hot money\" type should be controlled\r\nand even discouraged. The introduction of fiscally oriented capital\r\ncontrols (as Chile has implemented) is one possibility. The less\r\nattractive Malaysian model springs to mind. It is less attractive\r\nbecause it penalizes both the short term and the long-term financial\r\nplayers. But it is clear that an important and integral part of the new\r\nInternational Financial Architecture MUST be the control of speculative\r\nmoney in pursuit of ever-higher yields. There is nothing inherently\r\nwrong with high yields - but the capital markets provide yields\r\nconnected to economic depression and to price collapses through the\r\nmechanism of short selling and through the usage of certain\r\nderivatives. This aspect of things must be neutered or at least\r\ncountered.\r\n\r\nThe second lesson is the important role that central banks and other\r\nfinancial authorities play in the precipitation of financial crises -\r\nor in their prolongation. Financial bubbles and asset price inflation\r\nare the result of euphoric and irrational exuberance - said the\r\nChairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of the United States, the\r\nlegendary Mr. Greenspan and who can dispute this? But the question that\r\nwas delicately sidestepped was: WHO is responsible for financial\r\nbubbles? Expansive monetary policies, well-timed signals in the\r\ninterest rates markets, liquidity injections, currency interventions,\r\nand international salvage operations - are all co-ordinated by central\r\nbanks and by other central or international institutions. Official\r\nINACTION is as conducive to the inflation of financial bubbles as is\r\nofficial ACTION. By refusing to restructure the banking system, to\r\nintroduce appropriate bankruptcy procedures, corporate transparency and\r\ngood corporate governance, by engaging in protectionism and\r\nisolationism, by avoiding the implementation of anti competition\r\nlegislation - many countries have fostered the vacuum within which\r\nfinancial crises breed.\r\n\r\nThe third lesson is that international financial institutions can be of\r\nsome help - when not driven by political or geopolitical considerations\r\nand when not married to a dogma. Unfortunately, these are the rare\r\ncases. Most IFIs - notably the IMF and, to a lesser extent, the World\r\nBank - are both politicised and doctrinaire. It is only lately and\r\nfollowing the recent mega-crisis in Asia, that IFIs began to \"reinvent\"\r\nthemselves, their doctrines and their recipes. This added conceptual\r\nand theoretical flexibility led to better results. It is always better\r\nto tailor a solution to the needs of the client. Perhaps this should be\r\nthe biggest evolutionary step:\r\n\r\nThat IFIs will cease to regard the countries and governments within\r\ntheir remit as inefficient and corrupt beggars, in constant need of\r\nfinancial infusions. Rather they should regard these countries as\r\nCLIENTS, customers in need of service. After all, this, exactly, is the\r\nessence of the free market - and it is from IFIs that such countries\r\nshould learn the ways of the free market.\r\n\r\nIn broad outline, there are two types of emerging solutions. One type\r\nis market oriented - and the other, interventionist. The first type\r\ncalls for free markets, specially designed financial instruments (see\r\nthe example of the Brady bonds) and a global \"laissez faire\"\r\nenvironment to solve the issue of financial crises. The second approach\r\nregards the free markets as the SOURCE of the problem, rather than its\r\nsolution. It calls for domestic and where necessary international\r\nintervention and assistance in resolving financial crises.\r\n\r\nBoth approaches have their merits and both should be applied in varying\r\ncombinations on a case by case basis.\r\n\r\nIndeed, this is the greatest lesson of all:\r\n\r\nThere are NO magic bullets, final solutions, right ways and only\r\nrecipes. This is a trial and error process and in war one should not\r\nlimit one's arsenal. Let us employ all the weapons at our disposal to\r\nachieve the best results for everyone involved.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Article written on August 18, 1999)\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Shadowy World of International Finance\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStrange, penumbral, characters roam the boardrooms of banks in the\r\ncountries in transition. Some of them pop apparently from nowhere,\r\nothers are very well connected and equipped with the most excellent\r\nintroductions. They all peddle financial transaction,s which are too\r\ngood to be true and often are. In the unctuously perfumed propinquity\r\nof their Mercedesed, Rolex waving entourage - the polydipsic natives\r\ndissolve in their irresistible charm and the temptations of the cash:\r\nmountainous returns on capital, effulgent profits, no collaterals,\r\ntrack record, or business plan required. Total security is cloyingly\r\nassured.\r\n\r\nThese Fausts roughly belong to four tribes:\r\n\r\nThe Shoppers\r\n\r\nThese are the shabby operators of the marginal shadows of the world of\r\nfinance. They broker financial deals with meretricious sweat only to be\r\nrewarded their meagre, humiliated fees. Most of their deals do not\r\nmaterialize. The principle is very simple:\r\n\r\nThey approach a bank, a financial institution, or a borrower and say:\r\n\"We are connected to banks or financial institutions in the West. We\r\ncan bring you money in the form of credits. But to do that - you must\r\nfirst express interest in getting this money. You must furnish us with\r\na bank guarantee/promissory note/letter of intent that indicates that\r\nyou desire the credit and that you are willing to provide a liquid\r\nfinancial instrument to back it up.\" Having obtained such instruments,\r\nthe shoppers begin to \"shop around\". They approach banks and financial\r\ninstitutions (usually, in the West). This time, they reverse their\r\ntext: \"We have an excellent client, a good borrower. Are you willing to\r\nlend to it?\" An informal process of tendering ensues. Sometimes it ends\r\nin a transaction and the shopper collects a small commission (between\r\none quarter of a percentage point and two percentage points - depending\r\non the amount). Mostly it doesn't -and the Flying Dutchman resumes his\r\nwanderings looking for more venal gulosity and less legal probity.\r\n\r\nThe Con-Men\r\n\r\nThese are crooks who set up elaborate schemes (\"sting operations\") to\r\nextract money from unsuspecting people and financial institutions. They\r\nestablish \"front\" or \"phantom\" firms and offices throughout the world.\r\nThey tempt the gullible by offering them enormous, immediate, tax-free,\r\neffort-free, profits. They let the victims profit in the first round or\r\ntwo of the scam. Then, they sting: the victims invest money and it\r\nevaporates together with the dishonest operators. The \"offices\" are\r\ndeserted, the fake identities, the forged bank references, the\r\nfalsified guarantees are all exposed (often with the help of an inside\r\ninformant).\r\n\r\nProbably the most famous and enduring scam is the \"Nigerian-type\r\nConnection\". Letters - allegedly composed by very influential and\r\nhighly placed officials - are sent out to unsuspecting businessmen. The\r\nlatter are asked to make their bank accounts available to the former,\r\nwho profess to need the third party bank accounts through which to\r\nfunnel the sweet fruits of corruption. The account owners are promised\r\nhuge financial rewards if they collaborate and if they bear some\r\nminor-by-comparison upfront costs. The con-men pocket these \"expenses\"\r\nand vanish. Sometimes, they even empty the accounts of their entire\r\nbalance as they evaporate.\r\n\r\nThe Launderers\r\n\r\nA lot of cash goes undeclared to tax authorities in countries in\r\ntransition. The informal economy (the daughter of both criminal and\r\nlegitimate parents) comprises between 15% (Slovenia) and 50% (Russia,\r\nMacedonia) of the official one. Some say these figures are a deliberate\r\nand ferocious understatement. These are mind boggling amounts, which\r\ncirculate between financial centres and off shore havens in the world:\r\nCyprus, the Cayman Islands, Liechtenstein (Vaduz), Panama and dozens of\r\naspiring laundrettes.\r\n\r\nThe money thus smuggled is kept in low-yielding cash deposits. To\r\nescape the cruel fate of inflationary corrosion, it has to be\r\nreinvested. It is stealthily re-introduced to the very economy that it\r\nso sought to evade, in the form of investment capital or other\r\nfinancial assets (loans and credits). Its anxious owners are\r\npreoccupied with legitimising their stillborn cash through the conduit\r\nof tax-fearing enterprises, or with lending it to same. The emphasis is\r\non the word: \"legitimate\". The money surges in through mysterious and\r\nanonymous foreign corporations, via off-shore banking centres, even\r\nthrough respectable financial institutions (the Bank of New York we\r\nmentioned?). It is easy to recognize a laundering operation. Its\r\nhallmark is a pronounced lack of selectivity. The money is invested in\r\nanything and everything, as long as it appears legitimate.\r\nDiversification is not sought by these nouveau tycoons and they have no\r\ncore investment strategy. They spread their illicit funds among dozens\r\nof disparate economic activities and show not the slightest interest in\r\nthe putative yields on their investments, the maturity of their assets,\r\nthe quality of their newly acquired businesses, their history, or real\r\nvalue. Never the sedulous, they pay exorbitantly for all manner of\r\nprestidigital endeavours. The future prospects and other normal\r\ninvestment criteria are beyond them. All they are after is a mirage of\r\nlapidarity.\r\n\r\nThe Investors\r\n\r\nThis is the most intriguing group. Normative, law abiding, businessmen,\r\nwho stumbled across methods to secure excessive yields on their capital\r\nand are looking to borrow their way into increasing it. By cleverly\r\nparticipating in bond tenders, by devising ingenious option strategies,\r\nor by arbitraging - yields of up to 300% can be collected in the\r\nimmature markets of transition without the normally associated risks.\r\nThese sub-species can be found mainly in Russia and in the Balkans.\r\n\r\nIts members often buy sovereign bonds and notes at discounts of up to\r\n80% of their face value. Russian obligations could be had for less in\r\nAugust 1998 and Macedonian ones during the Kosovo crisis. In cahoots\r\nwith the issuing country's central bank, they then convert the\r\nobligations to local currency at par (=for 100% of their face value).\r\nThe difference makes, needless to add, for an immediate and hefty\r\nprofit, yet it is in (often worthless and vicissitudinal) local\r\ncurrency. The latter is then hurriedly disposed of (at a discount) and\r\nsold to multinationals with operations in the country of issue, which\r\nare in need of local tender. This fast becomes an almost addictive\r\navocation.\r\n\r\nIntoxicated by this pecuniary nectar, the fortunate, those privy to the\r\nsecret, try to raise more capital by hunting for financial instruments\r\nthey can convert to cash in Western banks. A bank guarantee, a\r\npromissory note, a confirmed letter of credit, a note or a bond\r\nguaranteed by the Central Bank - all will do as deposited collateral\r\nagainst which a credit line is established and cash is drawn. The cash\r\nis then invested in a new cycle of inebriation to yield fantastic\r\nprofits.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to identify these \"investors\". They eagerly seek financial\r\ninstruments from almost any local bank, no matter how suspect. They\r\noffer to pay for these coveted documents (bank guarantees, bankers'\r\nacceptances, letters of credit) either in cash or by lending to the\r\nbank's clients and this within a month or more from the date of their\r\nissuance. They agree to \"cancel\" the locally issued financial\r\ninstruments by offering a \"counter-financial-instrument\" (safe keeping\r\nreceipt, contra-guarantee, counter promissory note, etc.). This\r\n\"counter-instrument\" is issued by the very Prime World or European Bank\r\nin which the locally issued financial instruments are deposited as\r\ncollateral.\r\n\r\nThe Investors invariably confidently claim that the financial\r\ninstrument issued by the local bank will never be presented or used\r\n(which is true) and that this is a risk free transaction (which is not\r\nentirely so). If they are forced to lend to the bank's clients, they\r\noften ignore the quality of the credit takers, the yields, the\r\nmaturities and other considerations, which normally tend to interest\r\nlenders very much.\r\n\r\nWhether a financial instrument cancelled by another is still valid,\r\npresentable and should be honoured by its issuer is still debated. In\r\nsome cases it is clearly so. If something goes horribly (and rarely,\r\nadmittedly) wrong with these transactions - the local bank stands to\r\nsuffer, too.\r\n\r\nIt all boils down to a terrible hunger, the kind of thirst that can be\r\nquelled only by the denominated liquidity of lucre. In the post nuclear\r\nlandscape of this part of the world, a fantasy is shared by both\r\npredators and prey. Circling each other in marble temples, they switch\r\ntheir roles in dizzying progression. Tycoons and politicians,\r\nindustrialists and bureaucrats all vie for the attention of Mammon. The\r\nshifting coalitions of well-groomed man in back stabbed suits, an\r\nhallucinatory carousel of avarice and guile. But every circus folds and\r\nevery luna park is destined to shut down. The dying music, the frozen\r\naccounts of the deceived, the bankrupt banks, the Jurassic Park of\r\nskeletal industrial beasts - a muted testimony to a wild age of mutual\r\nassured destruction and self deceit. The future of Eastern and South\r\nEurope. The present of Russia, Albania and Yugoslavia.\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Typology of Financial Scandals\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTulipmania - this is the name coined for the first pyramid investment\r\nscheme in history.\r\n\r\nIn 1634, tulip bulbs were traded in a special exchange in Amsterdam.\r\nPeople used these bulbs as means of exchange and value store. They\r\ntraded them and speculated in them. The rare black tulip bulbs were as\r\nvaluable as a big mansion house. The craze lasted four years and it\r\nseemed that it would last forever. But this was not to be.\r\n\r\nThe bubble burst in 1637. In a matter of a few days, the price of tulip\r\nbulbs was slashed by 96%!\r\n\r\nThis specific pyramid investment scheme was somewhat different from the\r\nones, which were to follow it in human financial history elsewhere in\r\nthe world. It had no \"organizing committee\", no identifiable group of\r\nmovers and shakers, which controlled and directed it. Also, no explicit\r\npromises were ever made concerning the profits, which the investors\r\ncould expect from participating in the scheme - or even that profits\r\nwere forthcoming to them.\r\n\r\nSince then, pyramid schemes have evolved into intricate psychological\r\nploys.\r\n\r\nModern ones have a few characteristics in common:\r\n\r\nFirst, they involve ever growing numbers of people. They mushroom\r\nexponentially into proportions that usually threaten the national\r\neconomy and the very fabric of society. All of them have grave\r\npolitical and social implications.\r\n\r\nHundreds of thousands of investors (in a population of less than 3.5\r\nmillion souls) were deeply enmeshed in the 1983 banking crisis in\r\nIsrael.\r\n\r\nThis was a classic pyramid scheme: the banks offered their own shares\r\nfor sale, promising investors that the price of the shares will only go\r\nup (sometimes by 2% daily). The banks used depositors' money, their\r\ncapital, their profits and money that they borrowed abroad to keep this\r\nimpossible and unhealthy promise. Everyone knew what was going on and\r\neveryone was involved.\r\n\r\nThe Ministers of Finance, the Governors of the Central Bank assisted\r\nthe banks in these criminal pursuits. This specific pyramid scheme -\r\narguably, the longest in history - lasted 7 years.\r\n\r\nOn one day in October 1983, ALL the banks in Israel collapsed. The\r\ngovernment faced such civil unrest that it was forced to compensate\r\nshareholders through an elaborate share buyback plan, which lasted 9\r\nyears. The total indirect damage is hard to evaluate, but the direct\r\ndamage amounted to 6 billion USD.\r\n\r\nThis specific incident highlights another important attribute of\r\npyramid schemes: investors are promised impossibly high yields, either\r\nby way of profits or by way of interest paid. Such yields cannot be\r\nderived from the proper investment of the funds - so, the organizers\r\nresort to dirty tricks.\r\n\r\nThey use new money, invested by new investors - to pay off the old\r\ninvestors.\r\n\r\nThe religion of Islam forbids lenders to charge interest on the credits\r\nthat they provide. This prohibition is problematic in modern day life\r\nand could bring modern finance to a complete halt.\r\n\r\nIt was against this backdrop, that a few entrepreneurs and religious\r\nfigures in Egypt and in Pakistan established what they called: \"Islamic\r\nbanks\". These banks refrained from either paying interest to depositors\r\n- or from charging their clients interest on the loans that they doled\r\nout. Instead, they have made their depositors partners in fictitious\r\nprofits - and have charged their clients for fictitious losses. All\r\nwould have been well had the Islamic banks stuck to healthier business\r\npractices.\r\n\r\nBut they offer impossibly high \"profits\" and ended the way every\r\npyramid ends: they collapsed and dragged economies and political\r\nestablishments with them.\r\n\r\nThe latest example of the price paid by whole nations due to failed\r\npyramid schemes is, of course, Albania 1997. One third of the\r\npopulation was heavily involved in a series of heavily leveraged\r\ninvestment plans, which collapsed almost simultaneously. Inept\r\npolitical and financial crisis management led Albania to the verge of\r\ndisintegration into civil war.\r\n\r\nBut why must pyramid schemes fail? Why can't they continue forever,\r\nriding on the back of new money and keeping every investor happy, new\r\nand old?\r\n\r\nThe reason is that the number of new investors - and, therefore, the\r\namount of new money available to the pyramid's organizers - is limited.\r\nThere are just so many risk takers. The day of judgement is heralded by\r\nan ominous mismatch between overblown obligations and the trickling\r\ndown of new money. When there is no more money available to pay off the\r\nold investors, panic ensues. Everyone wants to draw money at the same\r\ntime. This, evidently, is never possible - some of the money is usually\r\ninvested in real estate or was provided as a loan. Even the most stable\r\nand healthiest financial institutions never put aside more than 10% of\r\nthe money deposited with them.\r\n\r\nThus, pyramids are doomed to collapse.\r\n\r\nBut, then, most of the investors in pyramids know that pyramids are\r\nscams, not schemes. They stand warned by the collapse of other pyramid\r\nschemes, sometimes in the same place and at the same time. Still, they\r\nare attracted again and again as butterflies are to the fire and with\r\nthe same results.\r\n\r\nThe reason is as old as human psychology: greed, avarice. The\r\norganizers promise the investors two things: (1) that they could draw\r\ntheir money anytime that they want to and (2) that in the meantime,\r\nthey will be able to continue to receive high returns on their money.\r\n\r\nPeople know that this is highly improbable and that the likelihood that\r\nthey will lose all or part of their money grows with time. But they\r\nconvince themselves that the high profits or interest payments that\r\nthey will be able to collect before the pyramid collapses - will more\r\nthan amply compensate them for the loss of their money. Some of them\r\nhope to succeed in drawing the money before the imminent collapse,\r\nbased on \"warning signs\". In other words, the investors believe that\r\nthey can outwit the organizers of the pyramid. The investors\r\ncollaborate with the organizers on the psychological level: cheated and\r\ndeceiver engage in a delicate ballet leading to their mutual downfall.\r\n\r\nThis is undeniably the most dangerous of all types of financial\r\nscandals. It insidiously pervades the very fabric of human\r\ninteractions. It distorts economic decisions and it ends in misery on a\r\nnational scale. It is the scourge of societies in transition.\r\n\r\nThe second type of financial scandals is normally connected to the\r\nlaundering of capital generated in the \"black economy\", namely: the\r\nincome not reported to the tax authorities. Such money passes through\r\nbanking channels, changes ownership a few times, so that its track is\r\ncovered and the identities of the owners of the money are concealed.\r\nMoney generated by drug dealings, illicit arm trade and the less exotic\r\nform of tax evasion is thus \"laundered\".\r\n\r\nThe financial institutions, which participate in laundering operations,\r\nmaintain double accounting books. One book is for the purposes of the\r\nofficial authorities. Those agencies and authorities that deal with\r\ntaxation, bank supervision, deposit insurance and financial liquidity\r\nare given access to this set of \"engineered\" books. The true record is\r\nkept hidden in another set of books. These accounts reflect the real\r\nsituation of the financial institution: who deposited how much, when\r\nand under which conditions - and who borrowed what, when and under\r\nwhich conditions.\r\n\r\nThis double standard blurs the true situation of the institution to the\r\npoint of no return. Even the owners of the institution begin to lose\r\ntrack of its activities and misapprehend its real standing.\r\n\r\nIs it stable? Is it liquid? Is the asset portfolio diversified enough?\r\nNo one knows. The fog enshrouds even those who created it in the first\r\nplace. No proper financial control and audit is possible under such\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nLess scrupulous members of the management and the staff of such\r\nfinancial bodies usually take advantage of the situation. Embezzlements\r\nare very widespread, abuse of authority, misuse or misplacement of\r\nfunds. Where no light shines, a lot of creepy creatures tend to develop.\r\n\r\nThe most famous - and biggest - financial scandal of this type in human\r\nhistory was the collapse of the Bank for Credit and Commerce\r\nInternational LTD. (BCCI) in London in 1991. For almost a decade, the\r\nmanagement and employees of this shady bank engaged in stealing and\r\nmisappropriating 10 billion (!!!) USD. The supervision department of\r\nthe Bank of England, under whose scrutinizing eyes this bank was\r\nsupposed to have been - was proven to be impotent and incompetent. The\r\nowners of the bank - some Arab Sheikhs - had to invest billions of\r\ndollars in compensating its depositors.\r\n\r\nThe combination of black money, shoddy financial controls, shady bank\r\naccounts and shredded documents proves to be quite elusive. It is\r\nimpossible to evaluate the total damage in such cases.\r\n\r\nThe third type is the most elusive, the hardest to discover. It is very\r\ncommon and scandal may erupt - or never occur, depending on chance,\r\ncash flows and the intellects of those involved.\r\n\r\nFinancial institutions are subject to political pressures, forcing them\r\nto give credits to the unworthy - or to forgo diversification (to give\r\ntoo much credit to a single borrower). Only lately in South Korea, such\r\npolitically motivated loans were discovered to have been given to the\r\nfailing Hanbo conglomerate by virtually every bank in the country. The\r\nsame may safely be said about banks in Japan and almost everywhere\r\nelse. Very few banks would dare to refuse the Finance Minister's\r\ncronies, for instance.\r\n\r\nSome banks would subject the review of credit applications to social\r\nconsiderations. They would lend to certain sectors of the economy,\r\nregardless of their financial viability. They would lend to the needy,\r\nto the affluent, to urban renewal programs, to small businesses - and\r\nall in the name of social causes, which, however justified - cannot\r\njustify giving loans.\r\n\r\nThis is a private case in a more widespread phenomenon: the assets\r\n(=loan portfolios) of many a financial institution are not diversified\r\nenough. Their loans are concentrated in a single sector of the economy\r\n(agriculture, industry, construction), in a given country, or\r\ngeographical region. Such exposure is detrimental to the financial\r\nhealth of the lending institution. Economic trends tend to develop in\r\nunison in the same sector, country, or region. When real estate in the\r\nWest Coast of the USA plummets - it does so indiscriminately. A bank,\r\nwhose total portfolio is composed of mortgages to West Coast Realtors,\r\nwould be demolished.\r\n\r\nIn 1982, Mexico defaulted on the interest payments of its international\r\ndebts. Its arrears grew enormously and threatened the stability of the\r\nentire Western financial system. USA banks - which were the most\r\nexposed to the Latin American debt crisis - had to foot the bulk of the\r\nbill, which amounted to tens of billions of USD. They had almost all\r\ntheir capital tied up in loans to Latin American countries. Financial\r\ninstitutions bow to fads and fashions. They are amenable to \"lending\r\ntrends\" and display a herd-like mentality. They tend to concentrate\r\ntheir assets where they believe that they could get the highest yields\r\nin the shortest possible periods of time. In this sense, they are not\r\nvery different from investors in pyramid investment schemes.\r\n\r\nFinancial mismanagement can also be the result of lax or flawed\r\nfinancial controls. The internal audit department in every financing\r\ninstitution - and the external audit exercised by the appropriate\r\nsupervision authorities are responsible to counter the natural human\r\npropensity for gambling. The must help the financial organization\r\nre-orient itself in accordance with objective and objectively analysed\r\ndata. If they fail to do this - the financial institution would tend to\r\nbehave like a ship without navigation tools. Financial audit\r\nregulations (the most famous of which are the American FASBs) trail way\r\nbehind the development of the modern financial marketplace. Still,\r\ntheir judicious and careful implementation could be of invaluable\r\nassistance in steering away from financial scandals.\r\n\r\nTaking human psychology into account - coupled with the complexity of\r\nthe modern world of finances - it is nothing less than a miracle that\r\nfinancial scandals are as few and far between as they are.\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Revolt of the Poor\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Demise of Intellectual Property\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA year ago I published a book of short stories in Israel. The\r\npublishing house belongs to Israel's leading (and exceedingly wealthy)\r\nnewspaper. I signed a contract, which stated that I am entitled to\r\nreceive 8% of the income from the sales of the book after commissions\r\npayable to distributors, shops, etc. A few months later, I won the\r\ncoveted Prize of the Ministry of Education (for short prose). The prize\r\nmoney (a few thousand DMs) was snatched by the publishing house on the\r\nlegal grounds that all the money generated by the book belongs to them\r\nbecause they own the copyright.\r\n\r\nIn the mythology generated by capitalism to pacify the masses, the myth\r\nof intellectual property stands out. It goes like this: if the rights\r\nto intellectual property were not defined and enforced, commercial\r\nentrepreneurs would not have taken on the risks associated with\r\npublishing books, recording records and preparing multimedia products.\r\nAs a result, creative people will have suffered because they will have\r\nfound no way to make their works accessible to the public. Ultimately,\r\nit is the public, which pays the price of piracy, goes the refrain.\r\n\r\nBut this is factually untrue. In the USA there is a very limited group\r\nof authors who actually live by their pen. Only select musicians eke\r\nout a living from their noisy vocation (most of them rock stars who own\r\ntheir labels - George Michael had to fight Sony to do just that) and\r\nvery few actors come close to deriving subsistence level income from\r\ntheir profession. All these can no longer be thought of as mostly\r\ncreative people. Forced to defend the intellectual property rights and\r\nthe interests of Big Money, Madonna, Michael Jackson, Schwarzenegger\r\nand Grisham are businessmen at least as much as they are artists.\r\n\r\nEconomically and rationally, we should expect that the costlier a work\r\nof art is to produce and the narrower its market - the more its\r\nintellectual property rights will be emphasized. Consider a publishing\r\nhouse. A book which costs 50,000 DM to produce with a potential\r\naudience of 1000 purchasers (certain academic texts are like this) -\r\nwould have to be priced at a minimum of 100 DM to recoup only the\r\ndirect costs. If illegally copied (thereby shrinking the potential\r\nmarket - some people will prefer to buy the cheaper illegal copies) -\r\nits price would have to go up prohibitively, thus driving out potential\r\nbuyers. The story is different if a book costs 10,000 DM to produce and\r\nis priced at 20 DM a copy with a potential readership of 1,000,000\r\nreaders. Piracy (illegal copying) will in this case have been more\r\nreadily tolerated as a marginal phenomenon.\r\n\r\nThis is the theory. But the facts are tellingly different. The less the\r\ncost of production (brought down by digital technologies) - the fiercer\r\nthe battle against piracy. The bigger the market - the more pressure is\r\napplied to clamp down on the samizdat entrepreneurs. Governments, from\r\nChina to Macedonia, are introducing intellectual property laws (under\r\npressure from rich world countries) and enforcing them belatedly. But\r\nwhere one factory is closed on shore (as has been the case in mainland\r\nChina) - two sprout off shore (as is the case in Hong Kong and in\r\nBulgaria).\r\n\r\nBut this defies logic: the market today is huge, the costs of\r\nproduction and lower (with the exception of the music and film\r\nindustries), the marketing channels more numerous (half of the income\r\nof movie studios emanates from video cassette sales), the speedy\r\nrecouping of the investment virtually guaranteed. Moreover, piracy\r\nthrives in very poor markets in which the population would anyhow not\r\nhave paid the legal price. The illegal product is inferior to the legal\r\ncopy (it comes with no literature, warranties or support). So why\r\nshould the big manufacturers, publishing houses, record companies,\r\nsoftware companies and fashion houses worry?\r\n\r\nThe answer lurks in history. Intellectual property is a relatively new\r\nnotion. In the near past, no one considered knowledge or the fruits of\r\ncreativity (art, design) as \"patentable\", or as someone \"property\". The\r\nartist was but a mere channel through which divine grace flowed. Texts,\r\ndiscoveries, inventions, works of art and music, designs - all belonged\r\nto the community and could be replicated freely. True, the chosen ones,\r\nthe conduits, were honoured but were rarely financially rewarded. They\r\nwere commissioned to produce their works of art and were salaried, in\r\nmost cases. Only with the advent of the Industrial Revolution were the\r\nembryonic precursors of intellectual property introduced but they were\r\nstill limited to industrial designs and processes, mainly as embedded\r\nin machinery. The patent was born. The more massified the market, the\r\nmore sophisticated the sales and marketing techniques, the bigger the\r\nfinancial stakes - the larger loomed the issue of intellectual\r\nproperty. It spread from machinery to designs, processes, books,\r\nnewspapers, any printed matter, works of art and music, films (which,\r\nat their beginning were not considered art), software, software\r\nembedded in hardware and even unto genetic material.\r\n\r\nIntellectual property rights - despite their noble title - are less\r\nabout the intellect and more about property. This is Big Money: the\r\nmarkets in intellectual property outweigh the total industrial\r\nproduction in the world. The aim is to secure a monopoly on a specific\r\nwork. This is an especially grave matter in academic publishing where\r\nsmall- circulation magazines do not allow their content to be quoted or\r\npublished even for non-commercial purposes. The monopolists of\r\nknowledge and intellectual products cannot allow competition anywhere\r\nin the world - because theirs is a world market. A pirate in Skopje is\r\nin direct competition with Bill Gates. When selling a pirated Microsoft\r\nproduct - he is depriving Microsoft not only of its income, but of a\r\nclient (=future income), of its monopolistic status (cheap copies can\r\nbe smuggled into other markets) and of its competition-deterring image\r\n(a major monopoly preserving asset). This is a threat, which Microsoft\r\ncannot tolerate. Hence its efforts to eradicate piracy - successful\r\nChina and an utter failure in legally-relaxed Russia.\r\n\r\nBut what Microsoft fails to understand is that the problem lies with\r\nits pricing policy - not with the pirates. When faced with a global\r\nmarketplace, a company can adopt one of two policies: either to adjust\r\nthe price of its products to a world average of purchasing power - or\r\nto use discretionary pricing. A Macedonian with an average monthly\r\nincome of 160 USD clearly cannot afford to buy the Encyclopaedia\r\nEncarta Deluxe. In America, 100 USD is the income generated in average\r\nday's work. In Macedonian terms, therefore, the Encarta is 20 times\r\nmore expensive. Either the price should be lowered in the Macedonian\r\nmarket - or an average world price should be fixed which will reflect\r\nan average global purchasing power.\r\n\r\nSomething must be done about it not only from the economic point of\r\nview. Intellectual products are very price sensitive and highly\r\nelastic. Lower prices will be more than compensated for by a much\r\nhigher sales volume. There is no other way to explain the pirate\r\nindustries: evidently, at the right price a lot of people are willing\r\nto buy these products. High prices are an implicit trade-off favouring\r\nsmall, elite, select, rich world clientele. This raises a moral issue:\r\nare the children of Macedonia less worthy of education and access to\r\nthe latest in human knowledge and creation?\r\n\r\nTwo developments threaten the future of intellectual property rights.\r\nOne is the Internet. Academics - fed up with the monopolistic practices\r\nof professional publications - already publish there in big numbers. I\r\npublished a few book on the Internet and they can be freely downloaded\r\nby anyone who has a computer or a modem. There are electronic\r\nmagazines, trade journals, billboards, professional publications,\r\nthousand of books are available full text. Hackers even made sites\r\navailable from which it is possible to download whole software and\r\nmultimedia products. It is very easy and cheap to publish in the\r\nInternet, the barriers to entry are virtually nil, pardon the pun. Web\r\naddresses are provided free of charge, authoring and publishing\r\nsoftware tools are incorporated in most word processors and browser\r\napplications. As the Internet acquires more impressive sound and video\r\ncapabilities it will proceed to threaten the monopoly of the record\r\ncompanies, the movie studios and so on.\r\n\r\nThe second development is also technological. The oft-vindicated\r\nMoore's law predicted the doubling of computer memory capacity every 18\r\nmonths. But memory is only one aspect. Another is the rapid\r\nsimultaneous advance on all technological fronts. Miniaturization and\r\nconcurrent empowerment of the tools available has made it possible for\r\nindividuals to emulate much larger scale organizations successfully. A\r\nsingle person, sitting at home with 5000 USD worth of equipment can\r\nfully compete with the best products of the best printing houses\r\nanywhere. CD-ROMs can be written on, stamped and copied in house. A\r\ncomplete music studio with the latest in digital technology has been\r\ncondensed to the dimensions of a single software. This will lead to\r\npersonal publishing, personal music recording and the digitisation of\r\nplastic art. But this is only one side of the story.\r\n\r\nThe relative advantage of the intellectual property corporation was not\r\nto be found exclusively in its technological prowess. Rather it was in\r\nits vast pool of capital and its marketing clout, market positioning,\r\nsales and distribution. Nowadays, anyone can print a visually\r\nimpressive book, using the above-mentioned cheap equipment. But in an\r\nage of an information glut, it is the marketing, the media campaigns,\r\nthe distribution and the sales that used to determine the economic\r\noutcome.\r\n\r\nThis advantage, however, is also being eroded. First, there is a\r\npsychological shift, a reaction to the commercialisation of intellect\r\nand spirit. Creative people are repelled by what they regard as an\r\noligarchic establishment of institutionalised, lowest common\r\ndenominator art and they are fighting back. Secondly, the Internet is a\r\nhuge (200 million people), truly cosmopolitan market with its own\r\nmarketing channels freely available to all. Even by default, with a\r\nminimum investment, the likelihood of being seen by surprisingly large\r\nnumbers of consumers is high.\r\n\r\nI published one book the traditional way - and another on the Internet.\r\nIn 30 months, I have received 2500 written responses regarding my\r\nelectronic book. This means that well over 75,000 people read it (the\r\nindustry average is a 3% response rate and my Link Exchange meter\r\nindicates that 160,000 people visited the site by February 2000, with\r\nwell over 630,000 impressions in the last 15 months alone). It is a\r\ntextbook (in psychopathology) - and 75,000 people (let alone 160,000)\r\nis a lot for this kind of publication. I am so satisfied that I am not\r\nsure that I will ever consider a traditional publisher again. Indeed,\r\nmy next book is being published in the very same way.\r\n\r\nThe demise of intellectual property has lately become abundantly clear.\r\nThe old intellectual property industries are fighting tooth and nail to\r\npreserve their monopolies (patents, trademarks, copyright) and their\r\ncost advantages in manufacturing and marketing.\r\n\r\nBut they are faced with three inexorable processes, which are likely to\r\nrender their efforts vain:\r\n\r\nThe Newspaper Packaging\r\n\r\nPrint newspapers offer package deals of subsidized content (sold for a\r\ntoken amount) and subsidizing advertising. In other words, the\r\nadvertisers pay for content formation and generation and the reader has\r\nno choice but be exposed to commercial messages as he or she studies\r\nthe contents.\r\n\r\nThis model - adopted earlier by radio and television - rules the\r\nInternet now and will rule the wireless Internet in the future. Content\r\nwill be made available free of all pecuniary charges. The consumer will\r\npay by providing his personal data (demographic data, consumption\r\npatterns and preferences and so on) and by being exposed to advertising.\r\n\r\nThus, content creators will benefit only by sharing in the advertising\r\ncake. They will find it increasingly difficult to implement the old\r\nmodel of royalties paid for access or ownership of intellectual\r\nproperty. The venerable (and expensive) \"Encyclopaedia Britannica\" is\r\nnow fully available on-line, free of charge. Its largesse is supported\r\nby advertising.\r\n\r\nDisintermediation\r\n\r\nA lot of ink has been spilt regarding this important trend. The removal\r\nof layers of brokering and intermediation - mainly on the manufacturing\r\nand marketing levels - is a historic development (though the\r\ncontinuation of a long term trend). Consider music for instance.\r\nStreaming audio on the Internet or MP3 files, which the consumer can\r\ndownload will render the CD obsolete. The Internet also provides a\r\nvenue for the marketing of niche products and reduces the barriers to\r\nentry previously imposed by the need to engage in costly marketing\r\n(\"branding\") campaigns and manufacturing activities.\r\n\r\nThis trend is also likely to restore the balance between artist and the\r\ncommercial exploiters of his product. The very definition of \"artist\"\r\nwill expand to include all creative people. Everyone will seek to\r\ndistinguish oneself, to \"brand\" himself and to auction her services,\r\nideas, products, designs, experience, etc. This is a return to\r\npre-industrial times when artisans ruled the economic scene. Work\r\nstability will vanish and work mobility will increase in a landscape of\r\nshifting allegiances, head hunting, remote collaboration and similar\r\nlabour market trends.\r\n\r\nMarket Fragmentation\r\n\r\nIn a fragmented market with a myriad of mutually exclusive market\r\nniches, consumer preferences and marketing and sales channels -\r\neconomies of scale in manufacturing and distribution are meaningless.\r\nNarrow casting replaces broadcasting, mass customisation replaces mass\r\nproduction, a network of shifting affiliations replaces the rigid\r\nowned-branch system. The decentralized, intrapreneurship-based\r\ncorporation is a late response to these trends. The mega-corporation of\r\nthe future is more likely to act as a collective of start-ups than as a\r\nhomogeneous, uniform (and, to conspiracy theorists, sinister)\r\njuggernaut it once was.\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScavenger Economies, Predator Economies\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe national economies of the world can be divided to the scavenger and\r\nthe predator types. The former are parasitic economies, which feed off\r\nthe latter. The relationship is often not that of symbiosis, where two\r\nparties maintain a mutually beneficial co-existence. Here, one economy\r\nfeeds off others in a way, which is harmful, even detrimental to the\r\nhosts. But this interaction - however undesirable - is the region's\r\nonly hope.\r\n\r\nThe typology of scavenger economies reveals their sources of sustenance:\r\n\r\nConjunctural - These economies feed off historical or economic\r\nconjunctures or crises. They position themselves as a bridge between\r\nwarring or conflicting parties. Switzerland rendered this service to\r\nNazi Germany (1933-1945), Macedonia and Greece to Serbia (1992 to the\r\npresent), Cyprus aided and abetted Russia (1987 to the present), Jordan\r\nfor Iraq (1991 to the present), and now, Montenegro acts the part for\r\nboth Serbia and Kosovo. These economies consist of smuggling, siege\r\nbreaking, contraband, arms trade and illegal immigration. They benefit\r\neconomically by violating both international and domestic laws and by\r\nproviding international outcasts and rogues with alternative routes of\r\nsupply, and with goods and services.\r\n\r\nCriminal - These economies are infiltrated by criminal gangs or\r\nsuffused with criminal behaviour. Such infiltration is two phased: the\r\nproperly criminal phase and the money laundering one. In the first\r\nphase, criminal activities yield income and result in wealth\r\naccumulation. In the second one, the money thus generated is laundered\r\nand legitimised. It is invested in legal, above-board activities. The\r\neconomy of the USA during the 19th century and in the years of\r\nprohibition was partly criminal. It is reminiscent of the Russian\r\neconomy in the 1990s, permeated by criminal conduct as it is. Russians\r\noften compare their stage of capitalist evolution to the American \"Wild\r\nWest\".\r\n\r\nPiggyback Service economies - These are economies, which provide\r\npredator economies with services. These services are aimed at\r\nre-establishing economic equilibrium in the host (predator) economies.\r\nTax shelters are a fine example of this variety. In many countries\r\ntaxes are way too high and result in the misallocation of economic\r\nresources. Tax shelters offer a way of re-establishing the economic\r\nbalance and re-instating a regime of efficient allocation of resources.\r\nThese economies could be regarded as external appendages, shock\r\nabsorbers and regulators of their host economies. They feed off market\r\nfailures, market imbalances, arbitrage opportunities, shortages and\r\ninefficiencies. Many post-Communist countries have either made the\r\nprovision of such services a part of their economic life or are about\r\nto do so. Free zones, off shore havens, off shore banking and\r\ntranshipment ports proliferate, from Macedonia to Archangelsk.\r\n\r\nAid economies - Economies that derive most of their vitality from aid\r\ngranted them by donor countries, multilateral aid agencies and NGOs.\r\nMany of the economies in transition belong to this class. Up to 15% of\r\ntheir GDP is in the form of handouts, soft loans and technical\r\nassistance. Rescheduling is another species of financial subsidy and\r\nvirtually all CEE countries have benefited from it. The dependence thus\r\nformed can easily deteriorate into addiction. The economic players in\r\nsuch economies engage mostly in lobbying and in political manoeuvring -\r\nrather than in production.\r\n\r\nDerivative or Satellite economies - These are economies, which are\r\nabsolutely dependent upon or very closely correlated with other\r\neconomies. This is either because they conduct most of their trade with\r\nthese economies, or because they are a (marginal) member of a powerful\r\nregional club (or aspire to become one), or because they are under the\r\neconomic (or geopolitical or military) umbrella of a regional power or\r\na superpower. Another variant is the single-commodity or single-goods\r\nor single-service economies. Many countries in Africa and many members\r\nof the OPEC oil cartel rely on a single product for their livelihood.\r\nRussia, for instance, is heavily dependent on proceeds from the sale of\r\nits energy products. Most Montenegrins derive their livelihood,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, from smuggling, bootlegging and illegal\r\nimmigration. Drugs are a major \"export\" earner in Macedonia and Albania.\r\n\r\nCopycat economies - These are economies that are based on legal or\r\n(more often) illegal copying and emulation of intellectual property:\r\npatents, brand names, designs, industrial processes, other forms of\r\ninnovation, copyrighted material, etc. The prime example is Japan,\r\nwhich constructed its whole mega-economy on these bases. Both Bulgaria\r\nand Russia are Meccas of piracy. Though prosperous for a time, these\r\neconomies are dependent on and subject to the vicissitudes of business\r\ncycles. They are capital sensitive, inherently unstable and with no\r\nreal long term prospects if they fail to generate their own\r\nintellectual property. They reflect the volatility of the markets for\r\ntheir goods and are overly exposed to trade risks, international\r\nlegislation and imports. Usually, they specialize in narrow segments of\r\nmanufacturing which only increases the precariousness of their\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nThe Predator Economies can also be classified:\r\n\r\nGenerators of Intellectual Property - These are economies that\r\nencourage and emphasize innovation and progress. They reward\r\ninnovators, entrepreneurs, non-conformism and conflict. They spew out\r\npatents, designs, brands, copyrighted material and other forms of\r\npackaged human creativity. They derive most of their income from\r\nlicensing and royalties and constitute one of the engines driving\r\nglobalisation. Still, these economies are too poor to support the\r\ncomplementary manufacturing and marketing activities. Their natural\r\ncounterparts are the \"Industrial Bases\". Within the former Eastern\r\nBloc, Russia, Poland, Hungary and Slovenia are, to a limited extent,\r\nsuch generators. Israel is such an economy in the Middle East.\r\n\r\nIndustrial Bases - These are economies that make use of the\r\nintellectual property generated by the former type within industrial\r\nprocesses. They do not copy the intellectual property as it is. Rather,\r\nthey add to it important elements of adaptation to niche markets, image\r\ncreation, market positioning, packaging, technical literature,\r\ncombining it with other products or services, designing and\r\nimplementing the whole production process, market (demand) creation,\r\nimprovement upon the originals and value added services. These\r\ncontributions are so extensive that the end products, or services can\r\nno longer to be identified with the originals, which serve as mere\r\ntriggers. Again, Poland, Hungary, Slovenia (and to a lesser extent,\r\nCroatia) come to mind.\r\n\r\nConsumer Oriented economies - These are Third Wave (Alvin Toffler's\r\nterm), services, information and knowledge driven economies. The\r\nover-riding set of values is consumer oriented. Wealth formation and\r\naccumulation are secondary. The primary activities are concerned with\r\nfostering markets and maintaining them. These \"weightless\" economies\r\nconcentrate on intangibles: advertising, packaging, marketing, sales\r\npromotion, education, entertainment, servicing, dissemination of\r\ninformation, knowledge formation, trading, trading in symbolic assets\r\n(mainly financial), spiritual pursuits, and other economic activities\r\nwhich enhance the consumer's welfare (pharmaceuticals, for instance).\r\nThese economies are also likely to sport a largish public sector, most\r\nof it service oriented. No national economy in CEE qualifies as\r\n\"Consumer Oriented\", though there are pockets of consumer-oriented\r\nentrepreneurship within each one.\r\n\r\nThe Trader economies - These economies are equivalent to the\r\ncardiovascular system. They provide the channels through which goods\r\nand services are exchanged. They do this by trading or assuming risks,\r\nby providing physical transportation and telecommunications, and by\r\nmaintaining an appropriately educated manpower to support all these\r\nactivities. These economies are highly dependent on the general health\r\nof international trade. Many of the CEE economies are Trader economies.\r\nThe openness ratio (trade divided by GDP) of most CEE countries is\r\nhigher than the G7 countries'. Macedonia, for instance, has a GDP of\r\n3.6 Billion US dollars and exports and imports of c. 2 billion US\r\ndollars. These are the official figures. Probably, another 0.5 billion\r\nUS dollars in trade go unreported. Additionally, it has one of the\r\nlowest weighted customs rate in the world. Openness to trade is an\r\nofficial policy, actively pursued.\r\n\r\nThese economies are predatory in the sense that they engage in zero-sum\r\ngames. A contract gained by a Slovenian company - is a contract lost by\r\na Croatian one. Luckily, in this last decade, the economic cake tended\r\nto grow and the sum of zero sum games was more welfare to all involved.\r\nThese vibrant economies - the hope of benighted and blighted regions -\r\nare justly described as \"engines\" because they pull all other\r\n(scavenger) economies with them. They are not likely to do so forever.\r\nBut their governments have assimilated the lessons of the 1930s.\r\nProtectionism is bad for everyone involved - especially for economic\r\nengines. Openness to trade, protection of property rights and\r\nfunctioning institutions increase both the number and the scope of\r\nmarkets.\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMarket Impeders and Market Inefficiencies\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEven the most devout proponents of free marketry and hidden hand\r\ntheories acknowledge the existence of market failures, market\r\nimperfections and inefficiencies in the allocation of economic\r\nresources. Some of these are the results of structural problems, others\r\nof an accumulation of historical liabilities. But, strikingly, some of\r\nthe inefficiencies are the direct outcomes of the activities of \"non\r\nbona fide\" market participants. These \"players\" (individuals,\r\ncorporations, even larger economic bodies, such as states) act either\r\nirrationally or egotistically (too rationally).\r\n\r\nWhat characterizes all those \"market impeders\" is that they are value\r\nsubtractors rather than value adders. Their activities generate a\r\nreduction, rather than an increase, in the total benefits (utilities)\r\nof all the other market players (themselves included). Some of them do\r\nit because they are after a self-interest, which is not economic (or,\r\nmore strictly, financial). They sacrifice some economic benefits in\r\norder to satisfy that self-interest (or, else, they could never have\r\nattained these benefits, in the first place). Others refuse to accept\r\nthe self-interest of other players as their limit. They try to maximize\r\ntheir benefits at any cost, as long as it is a cost to others. Some do\r\nso legally and some adopt shadier varieties of behaviour. And there is\r\na group of parasites - participants in the market who feed off its very\r\ninefficiencies and imperfections and, by their very actions, enhance\r\nthem. A vicious cycle ensues: the body economic gives rise to parasitic\r\nagents who thrive on its imperfections and lead to the amplification of\r\nthe very impurities that they prosper on.\r\n\r\nWe can distinguish six classes of market impeders:\r\n\r\n1. Crooks and other illegal operators. These take advantage of\r\nignorance, superstition, greed, avarice, emotional states of mind of\r\ntheir victims - to strike. They re-allocate resources from (potentially\r\nor actually) productive agents to themselves. Because they reduce the\r\nlevel of trust in the marketplace - they create negative added value.\r\n(See: \"The Shadowy World of International Finance\".)\r\n\r\n2. Illegitimate operators include those treading the thin line\r\nbetween legally permissible and ethically inadmissible. They engage in\r\npetty cheating through misrepresentations, half-truths, semi-rumours\r\nand the like. They are full of pretensions to the point of becoming\r\nimpostors. They are wheeler-dealers, sharp-cookies, Daymon Ranyon\r\ncharacters, lurking in the shadows cast by the sun of the market. Their\r\nimpact is to slow down the economic process through disinformation and\r\nthe resulting misallocation of resources. They are the sand in the\r\nwheels of the economic machine.\r\n\r\n3. The \"not serious\" operators. These are people too hesitant, or\r\nphobic to commit themselves to the assumption of any kind of risk. Risk\r\nis the coal in the various locomotives of the economy, whether local,\r\nnational, or global. Risk is being assumed, traded, diversified out of,\r\navoided, insured against. It gives rise to visions and hopes and it is\r\nthe most efficient \"economic natural selection\" mechanism. To be a\r\nmarket participant one must assume risk, it in an inseparable part of\r\neconomic activity. Without it the wheels of commerce and finance,\r\ninvestments and technological innovation will immediately grind to a\r\nhalt. But many operators are so risk averse that, in effect, they\r\nincrease the inefficiency of the market in order to avoid it. They act\r\nas though they are resolute, risk assuming operators. They make all the\r\nright moves, utter all the right sentences and emit the perfect noises.\r\nBut when push comes to shove - they recoil, retreat, defeated before\r\nstaging a fight. Thus, they waste the collective resources of all that\r\nthe operators that they get involved with. They are known to endlessly\r\nreview projects, often change their minds, act in fits and starts, have\r\nthe wrong priorities (for an efficient economic functioning, that is),\r\nbehave in a self defeating manner, be horrified by any hint of risk,\r\nsaddled and surrounded by every conceivable consultant, glutted by\r\ninformation. They are the stick in the spinning wheel of the modern\r\nmarketplace.\r\n\r\n4. The former kind of operators obviously has a character problem.\r\nYet, there is a more problematic species: those suffering from serious\r\npsychological problems, personality disorders, clinical phobias,\r\npsychoneuroses and the like. This human aspect of the economic realm\r\nhas, to the best of my knowledge, been neglected before. Enormous\r\namounts of time, efforts, money and energy are expended by the more\r\n\"normal\" - because of the \"less normal\" and the \"eccentric\". These\r\noperators are likely to regard the maintaining of their internal\r\nemotional balance as paramount, far over-riding economic\r\nconsiderations. They will sacrifice economic advantages and benefits\r\nand adversely affect their utility outcome in the name of principles,\r\nto quell psychological tensions and pressures, as part of\r\nobsessive-compulsive rituals, to maintain a false grandiose image, to\r\ngo on living in a land of fantasy, to resolve a psychodynamic conflict\r\nand, generally, to cope with personal problems which have nothing to do\r\nwith the idealized rational economic player of the theories. If\r\nquantified, the amounts of resources wasted in these coping manoeuvres\r\nis, probably, mind numbing. Many deals clinched are revoked, many\r\nbusinesses started end, many detrimental policy decisions adopted and\r\nmany potentially beneficial situations avoided because of these\r\npersonal upheavals.\r\n\r\n5. Speculators and middlemen are yet another species of parasites.\r\nIn a theoretically totally efficient marketplace - there would have\r\nbeen no niche for them. They both thrive on information failures. The\r\nfirst kind engages in arbitrage (differences in pricing in two markets\r\nof an identical good - the result of inefficient dissemination of\r\ninformation) and in gambling. These are important and blessed functions\r\nin an imperfect world because they make it more perfect. The\r\nspeculative activity equates prices and, therefore, sends the right\r\nsignals to market operators as to how and where to most efficiently\r\nallocate their resources. But this is the passive speculator. The\r\n\"active\" speculator is really a market rigger. He corners the market by\r\nthe dubious virtue of his reputation and size. He influences the market\r\n(even creates it) rather than merely exploit its imperfections. Soros\r\nand Buffet have such an influence though their effect is likely to be\r\nconsidered beneficial by unbiased observers. Middlemen are a different\r\nstory because most of them belong to the active subcategory. This means\r\nthat they, on purpose, generate market inconsistencies, inefficiencies\r\nand problems - only to solve them later at a cost extracted and paid to\r\nthem, the perpetrators of the problem. Leaving ethical questions aside,\r\nthis is a highly wasteful process. Middlemen use privileged information\r\nand access - whereas speculators use information of a more public\r\nnature. Speculators normally work within closely monitored, full\r\ndisclosure, transparent markets. Middlemen thrive of disinformation,\r\nmisinformation and lack of information. Middlemen monopolize their\r\ninformation - speculators share it, willingly or not. The more\r\ninformation becomes available to more users - the greater the\r\ndeterioration in the resources consumed by brokers of information. The\r\nsame process will likely apply to middlemen of goods and services. We\r\nare likely to witness the death of the car dealer, the classical retail\r\noutlet, the music records shop. For that matter, inventions like the\r\ninternet is likely to short-circuit the whole distribution process in a\r\nmatter of a few years.\r\n\r\n6. The last type of market impeders is well known and is the only\r\none to have been tackled - with varying degrees of success by\r\ngovernments and by legislators worldwide. These are the trade\r\nrestricting arrangements: monopolies, cartels, trusts and other illegal\r\norganizations. Rivers of inks were spilled over forests of paper to\r\nexplain the pernicious effects of these anti-competitive practices. The\r\nshort and the long of it is that competition enhances and increases\r\nefficiency and that, therefore, anything that restricts competition,\r\nweakens and lessens efficiency.\r\n\r\nWhat could anyone do about these inefficiencies? The world goes in\r\ncircles of increasing and decreasing free marketry. The globe was a\r\nmore open, competitive and, in certain respects, efficient place at the\r\nbeginning of the 20th century than it is now. Capital flowed more\r\nfreely and so did labour. Foreign Direct Investment was bigger. The\r\nmore efficient, \"friction free\" the dissemination of information (the\r\nultimate resource) - the less waste and the smaller the lebensraum for\r\nparasites. The more adherence to market, price driven, open auction\r\nbased, meritocratic mechanisms - the less middlemen, speculators,\r\nbribers, monopolies, cartels and trusts. The less political involvement\r\nin the workings of the market and, in general, in what consenting\r\nadults conspire to do that is not harmful to others - the more\r\nefficient and flowing the economic ambience is likely to become.\r\n\r\nThis picture of \"laissez faire, laissez aller\" should be complimented\r\nby even stricter legislation coupled with effective and draconian law\r\nenforcement agents and measures. The illegal and the illegitimate\r\nshould be stamped out, cruelly. Freedom to all - is also freedom from\r\nbeing conned or hassled. Only when the righteous freely prosper and the\r\nless righteous excessively suffer - only then will we have entered the\r\nefficient kingdom of the free market.\r\n\r\nThis still does not deal with the \"not serious\" and the \"personality\r\ndisordered\". What about the inefficient havoc that they wreak? This,\r\nafter all, is part of what is known, in legal parlance as: \"force\r\nmajeure\".\r\n\r\nNote\r\n\r\nThere is a raging debate between the \"rational expectations\" theory and\r\nthe \"prospect theory\". The former - the cornerstone of rational\r\neconomics - assumes that economic (human) players are rational and out\r\nto maximize their utility (see \"The Happiness of Others\", \"The\r\nEgotistic Friend\" and \"The Distributive Justice of the Market\"). Even\r\nignoring the fuzzy logic behind the ill-defined philosophical term\r\n\"utility\" - rational economics has very little to do with real human\r\nbeing and a lot to do with sterile (though mildly useful) abstractions.\r\nProspect theory builds on behavioural research in modern psychology,\r\nwhich demonstrates that people are more loss averse than gain seekers\r\n(utility maximisers). Other economists have succeeded to demonstrate\r\nirrational behaviours of economic actors (heuristics, dissonances,\r\nbiases, magical thinking and so on).\r\n\r\nThe apparent chasm between the rational theories (efficient markets,\r\nhidden hands and so on) and behavioural economics is the result of two\r\nphilosophical fallacies which, in turn, are based on the misapplication\r\nand misinterpretation of philosophical terms.\r\n\r\nThe first fallacy is to assume that all forms of utility are reducible\r\nto one another or to money terms. Thus, the values attached to all\r\nutilities are expressed in monetary terms. This is wrong. Some people\r\nprefer leisure, or freedom, or predictability to expected money. This\r\nis the very essence of risk aversion: a trade off between the utility\r\nof predictability (absence or minimization of risk) and the expected\r\nutility of money. In other words, people have many utility functions\r\nrunning simultaneously - or, at best, one utility function with many\r\nvariables and coefficients. This is why taxi drivers in New York cease\r\nworking in a busy day, having reached a pre-determined income target:\r\nthe utility function of their money equals the utility function of\r\ntheir leisure.\r\n\r\nHow can these coefficients (and the values of these variables) be\r\ndetermined? Only by engaging in extensive empirical research. There is\r\nno way for any theory or \"explanation\" to predict these values. We have\r\nyet to reach the stage of being able to quantify, measure and\r\nnumerically predict human behaviour and personality (=the set of\r\nadaptive traits and their interactions with changing circumstances).\r\nThat economics is a branch of psychology is becoming more evident by\r\nthe day. It would do well to lose its mathematical pretensions and\r\nadopt the statistical methods of its humbler relative.\r\n\r\nThe second fallacy is the assumption underlying both rational and\r\nbehavioural economics that human nature is an \"object\" to be analysed\r\nand \"studied\", that it is static and unchanged. But, of course, humans\r\nchange inexorably. This is the only fixed feature of being human:\r\nchange. Some changes are unpredictable, even in deterministic\r\nprinciple. Other changes are well documented. An example of the latter\r\nclass of changes in the learning curve. Humans learn and the more they\r\nlearn the more they alter their behaviour. So, to obtain any meaningful\r\ndata, one has to observe behaviour in time, to obtain a sequence of\r\nreactions and actions. To isolate, observe and manipulate environmental\r\nvariables and study human interactions. No snapshot can approximate a\r\nvideo sequence where humans are concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic Procurement and very Private Benefits\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn every national budget, there is a part called \"Public Procurement\".\r\nThis is the portion of the budget allocated to purchasing services and\r\ngoods for the various ministries, authorities and other arms of the\r\nexecutive branch. It was the famous management consultant, Parkinson,\r\nwho once wrote that government officials are likely to approve a\r\nmulti-billion dollar nuclear power plant much more speedily that they\r\nare likely to authorize a hundred dollar expenditure on a bicycle\r\nparking device. This is because everyone came across 100-dollar\r\nsituations in real life - but precious few had the fortune to expend\r\nwith billions of USD.\r\n\r\nThis, precisely, is the problem with public procurement: people are too\r\nacquainted with the purchased items. They tend to confuse their daily,\r\nhousehold-type, decisions with the processes and considerations, which\r\nshould permeate governmental decision-making. They label perfectly\r\nlegitimate decisions as \"corrupt\" - and totally corrupt procedures as\r\n\"legal\" or merely \"legitimate\", because this is what was decreed by the\r\nstatal mechanisms, or because \"this is the law\".\r\n\r\nProcurement is divided to defence and non-defence spending. In both\r\nthese categories - but, especially in the former - there are grave,\r\nwell founded, concerns that things might not be all what they seem to\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nGovernment - from India's to Sweden's to Belgium's - fell because of\r\nprocurement scandals, which involved bribes paid by manufacturers or\r\nservice providers either to individual in the service of the state or\r\nto political parties. Other, lesser cases, litter the press daily. In\r\nthe last few years only, the burgeoning defence sector in Israel saw\r\ntwo such big scandals: the developer of Israel's missiles was involved\r\nin one (and currently is serving a jail sentence) and Israel's military\r\nattaché to Washington was implicated - though, never convicted - in yet\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nBut the picture is not that grim. Most governments in the West\r\nsucceeded in reigning in and fully controlling this particular budget\r\nitem. In the USA, this part of the budget remained constant in the last\r\n35 (!) years at 20% of the GDP.\r\n\r\nThere are many problems with public procurement. It is an obscure area\r\nof state activity, agreed upon in \"customized\" tenders and in dark\r\nrooms through a series of undisclosed agreements. At least, this is the\r\npublic image of these expenditures.\r\n\r\nThe truth is completely different.\r\n\r\nTrue, some ministers use public money to build their private \"empires\".\r\nIt could be a private business empire, catering to the financial future\r\nof the minister, his cronies and his relatives. These two plagues -\r\ncronyism and nepotism - haunt public procurement. The spectre of\r\ngovernment official using public money to benefit their political\r\nallies or their family members - haunts public imagination and provokes\r\npublic indignation.\r\n\r\nThen, there are problems of plain corruption: bribes or commissions\r\npaid to decision makers in return for winning tenders or awarding of\r\neconomic benefits financed by the public money. Again, sometimes these\r\nmoneys end in secret bank accounts in Switzerland or in Luxembourg. At\r\nother times, they finance political activities of political parties.\r\nThis was rampantly abundant in Italy and has its place in France. The\r\nUSA, which was considered to be immune from such behaviours - has\r\nproven to be less so, lately, with the Bill Clinton alleged\r\nelection-financing transgressions.\r\n\r\nBut, these, with all due respect to \"clean hands\" operations and\r\nprinciples, are not the main problems of public procurement.\r\n\r\nThe first order problem is the allocation of scarce resources. In other\r\nwords, prioritising. The needs are enormous and ever growing. The US\r\ngovernment purchases hundreds of thousands of separate items from\r\noutside suppliers. Just the list of these goods - not to mention their\r\ntechnical specifications and the documentation, which accompanies the\r\ntransactions - occupies tens of thick volumes. Supercomputers are used\r\nto manage all these - and, even so, it is getting way out of hand. How\r\nto allocate ever-scarcer resources amongst these items is a daunting -\r\nclose to impossible - task. It also, of course, has a political\r\ndimension. A procurement decision reflects a political preference and\r\npriority. But the decision itself is not always motivated by rational -\r\nlet alone noble - arguments. More often, it is the by product and end\r\nresult of lobbying, political hand bending and extortionist muscle.\r\nThis raises a lot of hackles among those who feel that were kept out of\r\nthe pork barrel. They feel underprivileged and discriminated against.\r\nThey fight back and the whole system finds itself in a quagmire, a\r\nnightmare of conflicting interests. Last year, the whole budget in the\r\nUSA was stuck - not approved by Congress - because of these reactions\r\nand counter-reactions.\r\n\r\nThe second problem is the supervision, auditing and control of actual\r\nspending. This has two dimensions:\r\n\r\n1. How to make sure that the expenditures match and do not exceed\r\nthe budgetary items. In some countries, this is a mere ritual formality\r\nand government departments are positively expected to overstep their\r\nprocurement budgets. In others, this constitutes a criminal offence;\r\n\r\n2. How to prevent the criminally corrupt activities that we have\r\ndescribed above - or even the non criminal incompetent acts which\r\ngovernment officials are prone to do.\r\n\r\nThe most widespread method is the public, competitive tender for the\r\npurchases of goods and services.\r\n\r\nBut, this is not as simple as it sounds.\r\n\r\nSome countries publish international tenders, striving to secure the\r\nbest quality in the cheapest price - no matter what is its geographical\r\nor political source. Other countries are much more protectionist\r\n(notably: Japan and France) and they publish only domestic tenders, in\r\nmost cases. A domestic tender is open only to domestic bidders. Yet\r\nother countries limit participation in the tenders on various\r\nbackgrounds: the size of the competing company, its track record, its\r\nownership structure, its human rights or environmental record and so\r\non. Some countries publish the minutes of the tender committee (which\r\nhas to explain WHY it selected this or that supplier). Others keep it a\r\nclosely guarded secret (\"to protect commercial interests and secrets\").\r\n\r\nBut all countries state in advance that they have no obligation to\r\naccept any kind of offer - even if it is the cheapest. This is a needed\r\nprovision: the cheapest is not necessarily the best. The cheapest offer\r\ncould be coming from a very unreliable supplier with a bad past\r\nperformance or a criminal record or from a supplier who offers goods of\r\nshoddy quality.\r\n\r\nThe tendering policy of most of the countries in the world also\r\nincorporates a second principle: that of \"minimum size\". The cost of\r\nrunning a tender is prohibitive in the cases of purchases in small\r\namounts.\r\n\r\nEven if there is corruption in such purchases it is bound to cause less\r\ndamage to the public purse than the costs of the tender, which is\r\nsupposed to prevent it!\r\n\r\nSo, in most countries, small purchases can be authorized by government\r\nofficials - larger amounts go through a tedious, multi-phase tendering\r\nprocess. Public competitive bidding is not corruption-proof: many times\r\nofficials and bidders collude and conspire to award the contract\r\nagainst bribes and other, non-cash, benefits. But we still know of no\r\nbetter way to minimize the effects of human greed.\r\n\r\nProcurement policies, procedures and tenders are supervised by state\r\nauditing authorities. The most famous is, probably, the General\r\nAccounting Office, known by its acronym: the GAO.\r\n\r\nIt is an unrelenting, very thorough and dangerous watchdog of the\r\nadministration. It is considered to be highly effective in reducing\r\nprocurement - related irregularities and crimes. Another such\r\ninstitution is the Israeli State Reviser. What is common to both these\r\norgans of the state is that they have very broad authority. They\r\npossess (by law) judicial and criminal prosecution powers and they\r\nexercise it without any hesitation. They have the legal obligation to\r\nreview the operations and financial transactions of all the other\r\norgans of the executive branch. Their teams select, each year, the\r\norgans to be reviewed and audited. They collect all pertinent documents\r\nand correspondence. They cross the information that they receive from\r\nelsewhere. They ask very embarrassing questions and they do it under\r\nthe threat of perjury prosecutions. They summon witnesses and they\r\npublish damning reports, which, in many cases, lead to criminal\r\nprosecutions.\r\n\r\nAnother form of review of public procurement is through powers granted\r\nto the legislative arm of the state (Congress, Parliament, Bundestag,\r\nor Knesset). In almost every country in the world, the elected body has\r\nits own procurement oversight committee. It supervises the expenditures\r\nof the executive branch and makes sure that they conform to the budget.\r\nThe difference between such supervisory, parliamentary, bodies and\r\ntheir executive branch counterparts - is that they feel free to\r\ncriticize public procurement not only in the context of its adherence\r\nto budget constraints or its cleanliness - but also in a political\r\ncontext. In other words, these committees do not limit themselves to\r\nasking HOW - but also engage in asking WHY. Why this specific expense\r\nin this given time and location - and not that expense, somewhere else\r\nor some other time. These elected bodies feel at liberty - and often do\r\n- intervene in the very decision making process and in the order of\r\npriorities. They have the propensity to alter both quite often.\r\n\r\nThe most famous such committee is, arguably, the Congressional Budget\r\nOffice (CBO). It is famous because it is non-partisan and technocratic\r\nin nature. It is really made of experts, which staff its offices.\r\n\r\nIts apparent - and real - neutrality makes its judgements and\r\nrecommendations a commandment not to be avoided and, almost\r\nuniversally, to be obeyed. The CBO operates for and on behalf of the\r\nAmerican Congress and is, really, the research arm of that venerable\r\nparliament. In parallel, the executive part of the American system -\r\nthe Administration - has its own guard against waste and worse: the\r\nOffice of Management and Budget (OMB).\r\n\r\nBoth bodies produce learned, thickset, analyses, reports, criticism,\r\nopinions and recommendations. Despite quite a prodigious annual output\r\nof verbiage - they are so highly regarded, that virtually anything that\r\nthey say (or write) is minutely analysed and implemented to the last\r\nletter with an air of awe.\r\n\r\nOnly a few other parliaments have committees that carry such weight.\r\nThe Israeli Knesset has the extremely powerful Finance Committee, which\r\nis in charge of all matters financial, from appropriations to\r\nprocurement. Another parliament renowned for its tight scrutiny is the\r\nFrench Parliament - though it retains very few real powers.\r\n\r\nBut not all countries chose the option of legislative supervision. Some\r\nof them relegated parts or all of these functions to the executive arm.\r\n\r\nIn Japan, the Ministry of Finance still scrutinizes (and has to\r\nauthorize) the smallest expense, using an army of clerks. These clerks\r\nbecame so powerful that they have the theoretical potential to secure\r\nand extort benefits stemming from the very position that they hold.\r\nMany of them suspiciously join companies and organizations, which they\r\nsupervised or to which they awarded contracts - immediately after they\r\nleave their previous, government positions. The Ministry of Finance is\r\nsubject to a major reform in the reform-bent government of Prime\r\nMinister Hashimoto. The Japanese establishment finally realized that\r\ntoo much supervision, control, auditing and prosecution powers might be\r\na Pyrrhic victory: it might encourage corruption - rather than\r\ndiscourage it.\r\n\r\nBritain opted to keep the discretion to use public funds and the clout\r\nthat comes with it in the hands of the political level. This is a lot\r\nlike the relationship between the butter and the cat left to guard it.\r\nStill, this idiosyncratic British arrangement works surprisingly well.\r\nAll public procurement and expenditure items are approved by the EDX\r\nCommittee of the British Cabinet (=inner, influential, circle of\r\ngovernment), which is headed by the Ministry of Finance. Even this did\r\nnot prove enough to restrain the appetites of Ministers, especially as\r\nquid pro quo deals quickly developed. So, now the word is that the new\r\nLabour Prime Minister will chair it - enabling him to exert his\r\npersonal authority on matters of public money.\r\n\r\nBritain, under the previous, Tory, government also pioneered an\r\ninteresting and controversial incentive system for its public servants\r\nas top government officials are euphemistically called there. They\r\nreceive, added to their salaries, a portion of the savings that they\r\naffect in their departmental budgets. This means that they get a small\r\nfraction of the end of the fiscal year difference between their budget\r\nallowances and what they actually spent. This is very useful in certain\r\nsegments of government activity - but could prove very problematic in\r\nothers. Imagine health officials saving on medicines, or others saving\r\non road maintenance or educational consumables. This, naturally, will\r\nnot do.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say that no country officially approves of the payment of\r\nbribes or commission to officials in charge of public spending, however\r\nremote the connection is between the payment and the actions.\r\n\r\nYet, law aside many countries accept the intertwining of elites -\r\nbusiness and political - as a fact of life, albeit a sad one. Many\r\njudicial systems in the world even make a difference between a payment,\r\nwhich is not connected to an identifiable or discernible benefit, and\r\nthose that are. The latter - and only the latter - are labelled\r\n\"bribery\".\r\n\r\nWhere there is money - there is wrongdoing. Humans are humans - and\r\nsometimes not even that.\r\n\r\nBut these unfortunate derivatives of social activity can be minimized\r\nby the adoption of clear procurement policies, transparent and public\r\ndecision making processes and the right mix of supervision, auditing\r\nand prosecution. Even then the result is bound to be dubious, at best.\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLiquidity or Liquidation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLarge parts of the world today suffer from a severe liquidity crisis.\r\nThe famed globalisation of the capital markets seems to confine itself,\r\never more, to the richer parts, the more liquid exchanges, and the more\r\naffluent geopolitical neighbourhoods. The fad of \"emerging economies\"\r\nhas all but died out. Try telling the Macedonians about global capital\r\nmarkets: last year, the whole world invested 8 million USD in their\r\npoor country. Breadwinners earn 300 DM a month on average. Officially,\r\nin excess of one third of the workforce is unemployed. Small wonder\r\nthat people do not pay their bills, employers do not pay salaries, the\r\nbanking system has a marked tendency to crash every now and then and\r\nthe average real default rate is 50%.\r\n\r\nIlliquidity erodes the trust between the economic players. Such trust\r\nis a precondition to the existence of a thriving, modern economy. We\r\nall postpone the gratification of our desires: we save now and consume\r\nlater, for instance or we sell goods or services and get paid a month\r\nlater. Such postponement of gratification is at the heart of the\r\neconomic machine of the new age. It cannot be achieved, however, if the\r\nplayers do not trust each other to fulfil their promises (to pay, for\r\nexample). Alternatively, the state can instate an efficient court\r\nsystem, aided by active law enforcement agencies. Keeping promises can\r\nbe imposed to counter the natural tendency to ignore them.\r\n\r\nThe countries in transition lack both: liquidity necessary to keep\r\none's monetary word and the legal system to force him to do so if he\r\nreneges. Small wonder that solutions are actively being sought by all\r\ninvolved: the business community, the state, the courts and even by\r\nconsumers.\r\n\r\nIn this article, we will describe a few of the global trends. The\r\ntrends are global, the reaction is world-wide because the problem is\r\nglobal. Bouncing checks have become a household reality in places as\r\nrich as Israel, for instance. The mounting crisis in Southeast Asia\r\nforeshadows bankruptcies and delinquencies on a chilling scale.\r\n\r\nThe simplest method is to revert to a cash economy. Payments are\r\naccepted only in cash. This, naturally, slows the velocity of\r\nmoney-like products and diminishes their preponderance, obstructing the\r\nexpansion of economic activity. An even more malignant variant is the\r\nbarter economy. Goods and services are swapped on a no-cash basis. It\r\nis money that generates new value added (by facilitating the\r\nintroduction of new technology, to mention but one function). In the\r\nabsence of money, the economy stagnates, degenerates and, finally,\r\ncollapses because of massive mismatches of supply and demand aggregates\r\nand of the types of goods and services on offer and demanded. Still,\r\nthis system has the advantages of keeping the economic patient alive\r\neven following a massive liquidity haemorrhage. In the absence of\r\nbarter economy, the economy might have ground to a complete halt and\r\ndeteriorated to subsistence agriculture. But barter is like\r\nchemotherapy: it is good for a limited period of time and the side\r\neffects are, at times, worse than the disease.\r\n\r\nIn many countries (Georgia, to mention one) defaults are prevented by\r\ndemanding prepayment for projected consumption. Let us take the\r\nconsumption of electricity as an example: many heavy users and numerous\r\nhouseholds do not pay their bills at all. To disconnect the electricity\r\nis an effective punitive measure but it costs the electricity company a\r\nlot of money. The solution? Programmable Electronic Meters. The\r\nconsumers buy a smart card (very similar to phone-cards). The card\r\nallows the buyer to use a certain amount of prepaid electricity and is\r\nrechargeable. The consumer pays in advance, electricity is not wasted,\r\nthe electricity company is happy, the tariffs go down for all the\r\nusers. Prepayment does have a contracting effect on the demand and\r\nusage of electricity - but this is welcome. It just means that people\r\nuse electricity more efficiently.\r\n\r\nA totally different tack is the verification approach. The person\r\nmaking the payment carries with him a card that confirms that he is\r\ncreditworthy and will honour his obligations. Otherwise, the card also\r\nserves as an insurance policy: an entity, not connected to the\r\ntransaction, guarantees the payment for a fee. This entity is\r\nfinancially viable and strong enough to be fully trusted by the\r\nrecipient of the payment.\r\n\r\nThis market in credit guarantees is more developed in the USA (where\r\ncredit cards have overtaken cash and personal checks as a mode of\r\npayment) than in Western Europe. But even in Europe there are credit\r\ncard equivalents which are very widespread: the Eurocheck card, for\r\ninstance, is really a credit card, though it usually comes with\r\nphysical checks and guarantees only a limited amount. One must\r\ndifferentiate the functions of a debit card (with direct and immediate\r\nbilling of a bank account following a transaction) from those of a\r\ncredit card. The latter allows for the billing of the account to take\r\nplace in a given day during the month following the month in which the\r\ntransaction was effected or converts the payment into a series of\r\ninstalments (within the credit limits of the cardholder as approved by\r\nhis bank). But in both cases, the guarantee is there and is the most\r\npredominant feature of the system. Such cards seem like a perfect\r\nsolution but they are not: the commissions charged by the card issuers\r\nare outrageous. Between 2 and 10 percent of the payment made go to the\r\npockets of the card issuers. Cards get stolen, forged, lost, abused by\r\ntheir owners, expire. But with the advent of new technologies all these\r\nproblems should be solved. Electronic POS (point of sale) cash\r\nregisters, connected through networks of communication, check the card\r\nand verify its data: is it valid, is it presented by the lawful owner,\r\nwas it stolen or lost, is the purchase within the limits of the\r\napproved credit and so on. Then, the billing proceeds automatically.\r\nSuch devices will virtually eliminate fraud. The credit card companies\r\nwill guarantee the payments, which will be subject to residual crime.\r\n\r\nAnother fast developing solution is the smart card. These are cards\r\nsimilar to phone cards and they can be charged with money in the bank\r\nor through automatic teller machines. These cards (in wide use in\r\nBelgium, Austria, Germany and many other countries) contain an amount\r\nof money, which is deducted from the cardholders account. The account\r\nis billed for every recharge. The card is the electronic (and smart)\r\nequivalent of cash and it can be read (=debited) by special teller\r\nmachines in numerous businesses. When payment is made, the money stored\r\nin the card is reduced and the recipient of the payment stores the\r\npayment on magnetic media for later delivery to his bank (and crediting\r\nof his account).\r\n\r\nA more primitive version exists in many countries in Eastern Europe:\r\ndepositors receive checks exactly corresponding to the amount of money\r\ndeposited in their account. These checks are as safe as the banks that\r\nissued them because they are fully convertible to cash. They are,\r\nreally, paper \"smart cards\".\r\n\r\nCredit cards and (more cheaply) smart cards are a way to restore\r\nconfidence to a shattered, illiquid economy. Macedonia should consider\r\nthem both seriously and encourage them through the appropriate\r\nlegislation and assistance of the state. For Macedonia, the choice is\r\nto be liquid or, God forbid, to economically self-liquidate.\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Predicament of the Newly Rich\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey are the objects of thinly disguised envy. They are the raw\r\nmaterials of vulgar jokes and the targets of popular aggression. They\r\nare the Newly Rich. Perhaps they should be dealt with more\r\nappropriately within the academic discipline of psychology, but then\r\neconomics in a branch of psychology. To many, they represent a\r\npsychopathology or a sociopathology.\r\n\r\nThe Newly Rich are not a new phenomenon. Every generation has them.\r\nThey are the upstarts, those who seek to undermine the existing elite,\r\nto replace it and, ultimately to join it. Indeed, the Newly Rich can be\r\nclassified in accordance with their relations with the well-entrenched\r\nOld Rich. Every society has its veteran, venerable and aristocratic\r\nsocial classes. In most cases, there was a strong correlation between\r\nwealth and social standing. Until the beginning of this century, only\r\nproperty owners could vote and thus participate in the political\r\nprocess. The land gentry secured military and political positions for\r\nits off spring, no matter how ill equipped they were to deal with the\r\nresponsibilities thrust upon them. The privileged access and the\r\ninsider's mentality (\"old boys network\" to use a famous British\r\nexpression) made sure that economic benefits were not spread evenly.\r\nThis skewed distribution, in turn, served to perpetuate the advantages\r\nof the ruling classes.\r\n\r\nOnly when wealth was detached from the land, was this solidarity\r\nbroken. Land - being a scarce, non-reproducible resource - fostered a\r\nscarce, non-reproducible social elite. Money, on the other hand, could\r\nbe multiplied, replicated, redistributed, reshuffled, made and lost. It\r\nwas democratic in the truest sense of a word, otherwise worn thin. With\r\nmeritocracy in the ascendance, aristocracy was in descent. People made\r\nmoney because they were clever, daring, fortunate, and visionary - but\r\nnot because they were born to the right family or married into one.\r\nMoney, the greatest of social equalizers, wedded the old elite. Blood\r\nmixed and social classes were thus blurred. The aristocracy of capital\r\n(and, later, of entrepreneurship) - to which anyone with the right\r\nqualifications could belong - trounced the aristocracy of blood and\r\nheritage. For some, this was a sad moment. For others, a triumphant one.\r\n\r\nThe New Rich chose one of three paths: subversion, revolution and\r\nemulation. All three modes of reaction were the results of envy, a\r\nsense of inferiority and rage at being discriminated against and\r\nhumiliated.\r\n\r\nSome New Rich chose to undermine the existing order. This was perceived\r\nby them to be an inevitable, gradual, slow and \"historically\r\nsanctioned\" process. The transfer of wealth (and the power associated\r\nwith it) from one elite to another constituted the subversive element.\r\nThe ideological shift (to meritocracy and democracy or to\r\nmass-democracy as y Gasset would have put it) served to justify the\r\nhistorical process and put it in context. The successes of the new\r\nelite, as a class, and of its members, individually, served to prove\r\nthe \"justice\" behind the tectonic shift. Social institutions and mores\r\nwere adapted to reflect the preferences, inclinations, values, goals\r\nand worldview of the new elite. This approach - infinitesimal,\r\ngraduated, cautious, all accommodating but also inexorable and all\r\npervasive - characterizes Capitalism. The Capitalist Religion, with its\r\ntemples (shopping malls and banks), clergy (bankers, financiers,\r\nbureaucrats) and rituals - was created by the New Rich. It had multiple\r\naims: to bestow some divine or historic importance and meaning upon\r\nprocesses, which might have otherwise been perceived as chaotic or\r\nthreatening. To serve as an ideology in the Althusserian sense (hiding\r\nthe discordant, the disagreeable and the ugly while accentuating the\r\nconcordant, conformist and appealing). To provide a historical process\r\nframework, to prevent feelings of aimlessness and vacuity, to motivate\r\nits adherents and to perpetuate itself and so on.\r\n\r\nThe second type of New Rich (also known as \"Nomenclature\" in certain\r\nregions of the world) chose to violently and irreversibly uproot and\r\nthen eradicate the old elite. This was usually done by use of brute\r\nforce coated with a thin layer of incongruent ideology. The aim was to\r\nimmediately inherit the wealth and power accumulated by generations of\r\nelitist rule. There was a declared intention of an egalitarian\r\nredistribution of wealth and assets. But reality was different: a small\r\ngroup - the new elite - scooped up most of the spoils. It amounted to a\r\nsurgical replacement of one hermetic elite by another. Nothing changed,\r\njust the personal identities. A curious dichotomy has formed between\r\nthe part of the ideology, which dealt with the historical process - and\r\nthe other part, which elucidated the methods to be employed to\r\nfacilitate the transfer of wealth and its redistribution. While the\r\nfirst was deterministic, long-term and irreversible (and, therefore,\r\nnot very pragmatic) - the second was an almost undisguised recipe for\r\npillage and looting of other people' property. Communism and the\r\nEastern European (and, to a lesser extent, the Central European)\r\nversions of Socialism suffered from this inherent poisonous seed of\r\ndeceit. So did Fascism. It is no wonder that these two sister\r\nideologies fought it out in the first half of the twentieth century.\r\nBoth prescribed the unabashed, unmitigated, unrestrained, forced\r\ntransfer of wealth from one elite to another. The proletariat enjoyed\r\nalmost none of the loot.\r\n\r\nThe third way was that of emulation. The Newly Rich, who chose to adopt\r\nit, tried to assimilate the worldview, the values and the behaviour\r\npatterns of their predecessors. They walked the same, talked the same,\r\nclad themselves in the same fashion, bought the same status symbols,\r\nand ate the same food. In general, they looked as pale imitations of\r\nthe real thing. In the process, they became more catholic than the\r\nPope, more Old Rich than the Old Rich. They exaggerated gestures and\r\nmannerisms, they transformed refined and delicate art to kitsch, their\r\nspeech became hyperbole, their social associations dictated by\r\nridiculously rigid codes of propriety and conduct. As in similar\r\npsychological situations, patricide and matricide followed. The Newly\r\nRich rebelled against what they perceived to be the tyranny of a dying\r\nclass. They butchered their objects of emulation - sometimes,\r\nphysically. Realizing their inability to be what they always aspired to\r\nbe, the Newly Rich switched from frustration and permanent humiliation\r\nto aggression, violence and abuse. These new converts turned against\r\nthe founders of their newly found religion with the rage and conviction\r\nreserved to true but disappointed believers.\r\n\r\nRegardless of the method of inheritance adopted by the New Rich, all of\r\nthem share some common characteristics. Psychologists know that money\r\nis a love substitute. People accumulate it as a way to compensate\r\nthemselves for past hurts and deficiencies. They attach great emotional\r\nsignificance to the amount and availability of their money. They\r\nregress: they play with toys (fancy cars, watches, laptops). They fight\r\nover property, territory and privileges in a Jungian archetypal manner.\r\nPerhaps this is the most important lesson of all: the New Rich are\r\nchildren, aspiring to become adults. Having been deprived of love and\r\npossessions in their childhood - they turn to money and to what it can\r\nbuy as a (albeit poor because never fulfilling) substitute. And as\r\nchildren are - they can be cruel, insensitive, and unable to delay the\r\nsatisfaction of their urges and desires. In many countries (the\r\nemerging markets) they are the only capitalists to be found. There,\r\nthey spun off a malignant, pathological, form of crony capitalism. As\r\ntime passes, these immature New Rich will become tomorrow's Old Rich\r\nand a new class will emerge, the New Rich of the future. This is the\r\nonly hope - however inadequate and meagre - that developing countries\r\nhave.\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Solow Paradox\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Productive Hardware\r\n\r\nThe world is debating the Solow Paradox. Named after the Nobel laureate\r\nin economics, it was stated by him thus: \"You can see the computer age\r\neverywhere these days, except in the productivity statistics.\" The\r\nvenerable economic magazine, \"The Economist\" in its issue dated July\r\n24th, quotes the no less venerable Professor Robert Gordon (\"one of\r\nAmerica's leading authorities on productivity\") - p.20: \"...the\r\nproductivity performance of the manufacturing sector of the United\r\nStates economy since 1995 has been abysmal rather than admirable. Not\r\nonly has productivity growth in non-durable manufacturing decelerated\r\nin 1995-9 compared to 1972-95, but productivity growth in durable\r\nmanufacturing stripped of computers has decelerated even more.\"\r\n\r\nWhat should be held true - the hype or the dismal statistics? The\r\nanswer to this question is of crucial importance to economies in\r\ntransition. If investment in IT (information technology) actually\r\nRETARDS growth - then it should be avoided, at least until a\r\nfunctioning marketplace is there to counter its growth suppressing\r\neffects.\r\n\r\nThe notion that IT retards growth is counter-intuitive. It would seem\r\nthat, at the least, computers allow us to do more of the same things\r\nfaster. Typing, order processing, inventory management, production\r\nprocesses, number crunching are all managed more efficiently by\r\ncomputers. Added efficiency should translate into enhanced\r\nproductivity. Put simply, the same number of people can do more,\r\nfaster, more cheaply with computers than they can without them. Yet\r\nreality begs to differ.\r\n\r\nTwo elements are often neglected in considering the beneficial effects\r\nof IT.\r\n\r\nThe first is that the concept of information technology comprises two\r\nvery distinct economic activities: an all-purpose machine (the PC) and\r\nits enabling applications and a medium (the internet). Capital assets\r\nas distinct from media assets are governed by different economic\r\nprinciples, should be managed differently and be the subject of\r\ndifferent philosophical points of view.\r\n\r\nMassive, double digit increases in productivity are feasible in the\r\nmanufacturing of computer hardware. The inevitable outcome is an\r\nexponential explosion in computing and networking power. The dual rules\r\nwhich govern IT - Moore's (a doubling of chip capacity and computing\r\nprowess every 18 months) and Metcalf's (the exponential increase in a\r\nnetwork's processing ability as more computers connect to it) - also\r\ndictate a breathtaking pace of increased productivity in the hardware\r\ncum software aspect of IT. This has been duly detected by Robert Gordon\r\nin his \"Has the 'New Economy' rendered the productivity slowdown\r\nobsolete?\"\r\n\r\nBut for this increased productivity to trickle down to the rest of the\r\neconomy a few conditions have to be met.\r\n\r\nThe transition from old technologies to a new one (the computer renders\r\nmany a technology obsolete) must not involve too much \"creative\r\ndestruction\". The costs of getting rid of old hardware, software, of\r\naltering management techniques or adopting new ones, of shedding\r\nredundant manpower, of searching for new employees to replace the\r\nunqualified or unqualifiable, of installing new hardware, software and\r\nof training new people in all levels of the corporation are enormous.\r\nThey must never exceed the added benefits of the newly introduced\r\ntechnology in the long run. Hence the crux of the debate. Is IT more\r\nexpensive to introduce, run and maintain than the technologies that it\r\nso confidently aims to replace? Will new technologies be spun off the\r\ncore IT in a pace sufficient to compensate for the disappearance of old\r\nones? As the technology mature, will it overcome its childhood maladies\r\n(lack of operational reliability, bad design, non-specificity,\r\nimmaturity of the first generation of computer users, absence of user\r\nfriendliness and so on)?\r\n\r\nMoreover, is IT an evolution or a veritable revolution? Does it merely\r\nallow us to do more of the same only in a different way - or does it\r\nopen up hitherto unheard of vistas for human imagination and\r\ncreativity? The signals are mixed. IT did NOT succeed to do to human\r\nendeavour what electricity, the internal combustion engine or even the\r\ntelegraph have done. It is also not clear at all that IT is a UNIVERSAL\r\nphenomenon suitable to all climes and mentalities. The penetration of\r\nboth IT and the medium it gave rise to (the internet) is not uniform\r\nthroughout the world even where the purchasing power is similar and\r\neven among the corporate class. Countries post communism should take\r\nall this into consideration. Their economies may be too obsolete and\r\nhidebound, poor and badly managed to absorb yet another critical change\r\nin the form of IT. The introduction of IT into an ill-prepared market\r\nor corporation can be and often is counter-productive and\r\ngrowth-retarding.\r\n\r\nThe Cycle of the Internet\r\n\r\nThen, of course, there is the Internet.\r\n\r\nThe Internet runs on computers but it is related to them in the same\r\nway that a TV show is related to a TV set. To bundle to two, as is\r\noften done today, obscures the true picture and can often be very\r\nmisleading. For instance: it is close to impossible to measure\r\nproductivity in the services sector, let alone is something as wildly\r\ninformal and dynamic as the internet. It is clear by now that the\r\nInternet is a medium and, as such, is subject to the evolutionary cycle\r\nof its predecessors. Central and Eastern Europe has just entered this\r\ncycle while the USA is the most advanced.\r\n\r\nThe Internet is simply the latest in a series of networks, which\r\nrevolutionized our lives. A century before the Internet, the telegraph\r\nand the telephone have been similarly heralded as \"global\" and\r\ntransforming.\r\n\r\nSo, what should the CEE countries expect to happen to the Internet\r\nglobally and, later, within their own territories? The issue here\r\ncannot be cast in terms of productivity. It is better to apply to it\r\nthe imagery of the business cycle.\r\n\r\nAs we said, every medium of communications goes through the same\r\nevolutionary cycle:\r\n\r\nIt starts with Anarchy - or The Public Phase.\r\n\r\nAt this stage, the medium and the resources attached to it are very\r\ncheap, accessible, under no regulatory constraints. The public sector\r\nsteps in: higher education institutions, religious institutions,\r\ngovernment, not for profit organizations, non-governmental\r\norganizations (NGOs), trade unions, etc. Bedevilled by limited\r\nfinancial resources, they regard the new medium as a cost effective way\r\nof disseminating their messages.\r\n\r\nThe Internet was not exempt from this phase, which is at its death\r\nthroes. It started with a complete computer anarchy manifested in ad\r\nhoc networks, local networks, networks of organizations (mainly\r\nuniversities and organs of the government such as DARPA, a part of the\r\ndefence establishment, in the USA). Non-commercial entities jumped on\r\nthe bandwagon and started sewing these networks together (an activity\r\nfully subsidized by government funds). The result was a\r\nglobe-encompassing network of academic institutions. The American\r\nPentagon established the network of all networks, the ARPANET. Other\r\ngovernment departments joined the fray, headed by the National Science\r\nFoundation (NSF) which withdrew only lately from the Internet.\r\n\r\nThe Internet (with a different name) became public property - with\r\naccess granted to the chosen few.\r\n\r\nRadio took precisely this course. Radio transmissions started in the\r\nUSA in 1920. Those were anarchic broadcasts with no discernible\r\nregularity. Non commercial organizations and not for profit\r\norganizations began their own broadcasts and even created radio\r\nbroadcasting infrastructure (albeit of the cheap and local kind)\r\ndedicated to their audiences. Trade unions, certain educational\r\ninstitutions and religious groups commenced \"public radio\" broadcasts.\r\n\r\nThis is followed by the Commercial Phase.\r\n\r\nWhen the users (e.g., listeners in the case of the radio, or owners of\r\nPCs and modems in the example of the Internet) reach a critical mass -\r\nthe business sector is alerted. In the name of capitalist ideology\r\n(another religion, really) it demands \"privatisation\" of the medium.\r\nThis harps on very sensitive strings in every Western soul: the\r\nefficient allocation of resources which is the result of competition;\r\ncorruption and inefficiency which are naturally associated with the\r\npublic sector (\"Other People's Money\" - OPM); the ulterior motives of\r\nmembers of the ruling political echelons (the infamous American\r\nParanoia); a lack of variety and of catering to the tastes and\r\ninterests of certain audiences; the equation private enterprise =\r\ndemocracy and more.\r\n\r\nThe end result is the same: the private sector takes over the medium\r\nfrom \"below\" (makes offers to the owners or operators of the medium -\r\nthat they cannot possibly refuse) - or from \"above\" (successful\r\nlobbying in the corridors of power leads to the appropriate legislation\r\nand the medium is \"privatised\").\r\n\r\nEvery privatisation - especially that of a medium - provokes public\r\nopposition. There are (usually founded) suspicions that the interests\r\nof the public were compromised and sacrificed on the altar of\r\ncommercialisation and rating. Fears of monopolization and cartelisation\r\nof the medium are evoked - and justified, in due time. Otherwise, there\r\nis fear of the concentration of control of the medium in a few hands.\r\nAll these things do happen - but the pace is so slow that the initial\r\nfears are forgotten and public attention reverts to fresher issues.\r\n\r\nA new Communications Act was legislated in the USA in 1934. It was\r\nmeant to transform radio frequencies into a national resource to be\r\nsold to the private sector, which will use it to transmit radio signals\r\nto receivers. In other words: the radio was passed on to private and\r\ncommercial hands. Public radio was doomed to be marginalized.\r\n\r\nThe American administration withdrew from its last major involvement in\r\nthe Internet in April 1995, when the NSF ceased to finance some of the\r\nnetworks and, thus, privatised its hitherto heavy involvement in the\r\nnet.\r\n\r\nA new Communications Act was legislated in 1996. It permitted\r\n\"organized anarchy\". It allowed media operators to invade each other's\r\nterritories.\r\n\r\nPhone companies will be allowed to transmit video and cable companies\r\nwill be allowed to transmit telephony, for instance. This is all phased\r\nover a long period of time - still, it is a revolution whose magnitude\r\nis difficult to gauge and whose consequences defy imagination. It\r\ncarries an equally momentous price tag - official censorship.\r\n\"Voluntary censorship\", to be sure, somewhat toothless standardization\r\nand enforcement authorities, to be sure - still, a censorship with its\r\nown institutions to boot. The private sector reacted by threatening\r\nlitigation - but, beneath the surface it is caving in to pressure and\r\ntemptation, constructing its own censorship codes both in the cable and\r\nin the internet media.\r\n\r\nThe third phase is Institutionalisation.\r\n\r\nIt is characterized by enhanced activities of legislation. Legislators,\r\non all levels, discover the medium and lurch at it passionately.\r\nResources, which were considered \"free\", suddenly are transformed to\r\n\"national treasures not to be dispensed with cheaply, casually and with\r\nfrivolity\".\r\n\r\nIt is conceivable that certain parts of the Internet will be\r\n\"nationalized\" (for instance, in the form of a licensing requirement)\r\nand tendered to the private sector. Legislation will be enacted which\r\nwill deal with permitted and disallowed content (obscenity? incitement?\r\nracial or gender bias?).\r\n\r\nNo medium in the USA (not to mention the wide world) has eschewed such\r\nlegislation. There are sure to be demands to allocate time (or space,\r\nor software, or content, or hardware, or bandwidth) to \"minorities\", to\r\n\"public affairs\", to \"community business\". This is a tax that the\r\nbusiness sector will have to pay to fend off the eager legislator and\r\nhis nuisance value.\r\n\r\nAll this is bound to lead to a monopolization of hosts and servers. The\r\nimportant broadcast channels will diminish in number and be subjected\r\nto severe content restrictions. Sites, which will not succumb to these\r\nrequirements - will be deleted or neutralized. Content guidelines\r\n(euphemism for censorship) exist, even as we write, in all major\r\ncontent providers (CompuServe, AOL, Prodigy).\r\n\r\nThe last, determining, phase is The Bloodbath.\r\n\r\nThis is the phase of consolidation. The number of players is severely\r\nreduced. The number of browser types will be limited to 2-3 (Netscape,\r\nMicrosoft and which else?). Networks will merge to form privately owned\r\nmega-networks. Servers will merge to form hyper-servers run on\r\nsupercomputers. The number of ISPs will be considerably diminished.\r\n\r\n50 companies ruled the greater part of the media markets in the USA in\r\n1983. The number in 1995 was 18. At the end of the century they will\r\nnumber 6.\r\n\r\nThis is the stage when companies - fighting for financial survival -\r\nstrive to acquire as many users/listeners/viewers as possible. The\r\nprogramming is shallowed to the lowest (and widest) common denominator.\r\nShallow programming dominates as long as the bloodbath proceeds.\r\n\r\nIn hindsight, 20 years hence, we might come to understand that\r\ncomputers improved our capacity to do things differently and more\r\nproductively. But one thing is fast becoming clear. The added benefits\r\nof IT are highly sensitive to and dependent upon historical,\r\npsychosocial and economic parameters outside the perimeter of the\r\ntechnology itself. When it is introduced, how it is introduced, for\r\nwhich purposes is it put to use and even by who it was introduced -\r\nlargely determine the costs of its introduction and, therefore, its\r\nfeasibility and contribution to the enhancement of productivity. The\r\nCEE countries better take note.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Article written on July 26, 1999 and published August 9, 1999\r\n\r\nin \"Central Europe Review\" volume 1, issue 7)\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nE P I L O G U E\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Balkans, an eternal crossroad of different civilizations and\r\ncultures even today, is considered to be the \"navel of the world\" or as\r\nSam Vaknin puts it in his erratic, eruptive, intellectual volcano of a\r\nbook, \"After the Rain - How the West Lost the East\" - \"is the\r\nunconscious of the world\" (\"The Mind of Darkness\") or worse, probably a\r\nnavel, but \"the Balkan is a body without a brain\" (\"Homo Balkanus\").\r\n\r\nThere are a few other, similarly neuralgic points on Earth, but what\r\ndistinguishes the Balkans from the rest is that it is precisely via its\r\ncentral part - Macedonia - that Christianity and modern literacy\r\ninvaded Europe. The Byzantine civilization - traceable in today's\r\nBalkans as a junction of the Hellenic spirit and the wisdom of\r\nByzantium, deeply rooted in the cultures of Babylon and the old\r\nMesopotamian civilizations - is still of high interest to modern\r\nscholars of the Balkans.\r\n\r\nDr. Sam Vaknin is one of these contemporary detectors of the\r\n\"transitions\" in the East, who is trying to discover, understand and\r\ndirect the Balkans and the East through his publicist work. In his book\r\n\"After the Rain - How the West Lost the East\", Dr. Sam Vaknin is a\r\nsincere investigator of the \"Homo Balkanus\", of the Easterner, his\r\nmind, culture and way of living, defining him \"a full fledges\r\nnarcissist\". Immediately after that, in \"The Magla Vocables\" he says\r\nthat even linguistically \"it is impossible to really understand an\r\nEasterner\", mocking or more precisely reaching the level of real\r\noffence in portraying the image of the intellectuals of the East (\"The\r\nPoets and Eclipse\").\r\n\r\nReading this large book of essays, however, one should bear in mind\r\nthat the author is limited by the clichés of his framework of values\r\nand thinking given to him by the culture and system of rules from which\r\nhe originated. Thus, his articles are provocative, turbulent,\r\nirritating, revolting. The impact of his writing is terrible with the\r\nstrength of hurricane. His word often kill, his defeatism nullifies.\r\nSometimes pretentious, still \"After the Rain\" represents a serious,\r\nlucid and transcendent effort to make the Balkan closer, to introduce\r\nthe East to the West, ignoring for a moment the pessimistic assertion\r\nthat the West already lost the East.\r\n\r\nBut if this were right, it would have meant that the West is lost, had\r\ndisappeared in the East. The truth is completely the opposite: The West\r\nhas yet to find the East. The East, which provided the foundation of\r\ncontemporary Western civilization, literacy and Christianity, still\r\nhibernates within its traditional values as an essential element of the\r\nendurance of the people and perhaps as the unique salvation of mankind.\r\nThe West has to burst into the wisdom of the East to keep the very\r\nroots of life, the wisdom to live in peace and in harmony with God and\r\nwith nature. If this should not happen, we will all finish like in\r\nAldous Huxley's \"Brave New World\".\r\n\r\nConsequently, when reading these essays, it will not be asking for much\r\nto have a dose of restraint towards Dr. Vaknin's sometimes lethal\r\n\"absolute truths\" regarding the Balkans and the East. After you finish\r\nreading this book, you can find out not only what the East is - but\r\nalso what the East is, indeed, not. This is because Dr. Vaknin observes\r\nthe Balkan and the East only from the dark side, regarding its people\r\nas zombies who do not have any idea at all why they are walking on this\r\nEarth. Unfortunately for him, life, neither in the Balkans in\r\nparticular, nor in the East in general, is a pathology as he enjoys\r\nsaying. That is why some of his articles contain an overly heavy-handed\r\npersonal touch, momentary sensations and impressions too strong,\r\namounting to exaggeration, or, in other words, he puts things headlong.\r\n\r\nIn \"The MinMaj Rule\" his paranoiac fear of the \"nation-state\" can be\r\nfelt. His perversity reaches a climax when he finds a justification for\r\nthe West and its three months long NATO bombing of Yugoslavia (an act\r\nwithout precedent in modern history, which indeed resulted in the same\r\npitiless kind of bombing in Chechnya) and in the acknowledgment that\r\nfor the Albanian residents of Kosovo \"it has not protected their right\r\nto self-determination\".\r\n\r\nDr. Vaknin likes to see the state as \"a community, a majority of\r\nminorities united by common rules, beliefs and aspirations ... no\r\nlonger utopian, it is a realistic model to emulate\". In \"Herzl's\r\nButlers\", he even goes further and in the modern nation state he sees\r\n\"a reflection of something more primordial, of human nature itself as\r\nit resonated in the national founding myths (most of them fictitious or\r\ncontrived)\". Still, he is sufficiently honest to admit that \"the Jews\r\n(and Germans) came up with the 'objective', 'genetic', 'racial' and\r\n'organic' nation\". Indeed, through the periodically harsh critique of\r\nthe West's actions in the East, transferring into its body Western\r\nmalignant cells of mafia, drugs, organized crime, corruption etc., the\r\ncareful reader will discover the glorification of the subjugation of\r\nthe East by the West.\r\n\r\nDr. Sam Vaknin is not the first one to try to put all the books which\r\ndeal with the so called \"world conspiracy\" in the domain of illusion or\r\nman's gullibility (\"The Elders of Zion\"). That was done before in a\r\nfine literary manner mixed with factography by another Jew (by father),\r\nthe writer Danilo Kish from ex-Yugoslavia, in his novel \"A Book about\r\nKings and Fools\". But if Danilo Kish was exploring the world archives\r\nto prove that it is only by coincidence or through an accidental knot\r\nof circumstance that \"the book of Nillus\" about a \"world conspiracy\"\r\nwas created, thus far Dr. Vaknin is not only mocking the intellectuals\r\nand ordinary mortals of the East, but he humiliatingly attributes the\r\nexistence of that \"conspiracy\" to the \"paranoiac and schizoid nature\"\r\nof their minds.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting that the author uses a tour of the abundant history\r\nof the region just to explain the \"darkness\" of today's. Or, without\r\nnecessity and astonishingly, he is giving a huge treatment only to the\r\nidea of the - in essence illusory and never existing - \"Great Albania\",\r\nadapting history for his own needs. He even smoothly, in only few\r\nlines, gives \"the definite historical truths\" about the Illyrians and\r\ntheir descendents, a subject on which historians composed large tomes\r\nand which they investigated all their lives and about which they still\r\nhave dilemmas.\r\n\r\nFinally, where does Dr. Vaknin think that the West lost the East? Is it\r\non its way from Babylon towards some new \"promised lands\"? Or, is it\r\nmaybe - After the Rain - in a Biblical flood?\r\n\r\nAlthough both in the West as well as in the East, it is precisely the\r\nJewish version of the Bible out of the thirteen existing ones that is\r\nthe dominant (a version which is rather a copy of the prehistoric Bible\r\ntext of the Sumerians from Mesopotamia) - nevertheless God promised\r\nhimself: \"Never again will I curse the ground because of man, however\r\nevil his inclinations may be from his youth upwards\" and God said:\r\n\"This is the sign of the covenant which I establish between myself and\r\nyou and every living creature with you, to endless generations:\r\n\r\nMy bow I set in the cloud,\r\n\r\nSign of the covenant\r\n\r\nBetween myself and earth.\r\n\r\nWhen I cloud the sky over the earth,\r\n\r\nThe bow shall be seen in the cloud.\r\n\r\nThen will I remember the covenant which I have made between myself and\r\nyou and living things of every kind. Never again shall the waters\r\nbecome a flood to destroy all living creatures. The bow shall be in the\r\ncloud; when I see it, it will remind me of the everlasting covenant\r\nbetween God and living things on earth of every kind.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Balkans, all things aside, this blessing of God - the bow - can\r\nbe often felt and enjoyed. Or as one of our proverbs says - After the\r\nRain always cometh the Sun!\r\n\r\n\r\nEmilija Geleva\r\n\r\nSkopje, February 2000\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nT H E   A U T H O R\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSHMUEL (SAM) VAKNIN\r\n\r\n\r\nCurriculum Vitae\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBorn in 1961 in Qiryat-Yam, Israel.\r\n\r\nEducation\r\n\r\nGraduated a few semesters in the Technion - Israel Institute of\r\nTechnology, Haifa.\r\n\r\nPh.D. in Philosophy (major: Philosophy of Physics) - Pacific Western\r\nUniversity, California, USA.\r\n\r\nGraduate of numerous courses in Finance Theory and International\r\nTrading.\r\n\r\nCertified E-Commerce Concepts Analyst.\r\n\r\nCertified in Psychological Counselling Techniques.\r\n\r\nFull proficiency in Hebrew and in English.\r\n\r\nBusiness Experience\r\n\r\n1980 to 1983\r\n\r\nFounder and co-owner of a chain of computerised information kiosks in\r\nTel-Aviv, Israel.\r\n\r\n1982 to 1985\r\n\r\nSenior positions with the Nessim D.

People stop\r\nto digest this metaphor and then they nod enthusiastically. It is here\r\nthat the repressed memories of history, its traumas and fears and\r\nimages reside. It is here that the psychodynamics of humanity - the\r\ntectonic clash between Rome and Byzantium, West and East,\r\nJudeo-Christianity and Islam - is still easily discernible. We are\r\nseated at a New Year's dining table, loaded with a roasted pig and\r\nexotic salads. I, the Jew, only half foreign to this cradle of\r\nSlavonics. Four Serbs, five Macedonians. It is in the Balkans that all\r\nethnic distinctions fail and it is here that they prevail\r\nanachronistically and atavistically. Contradiction and change the only\r\ntwo fixtures of this tormented region. The women of the Balkan - buried\r\nunder provocative mask-like make up, retro hairstyles and too narrow\r\ndresses. The men, clad in sepia colours, old fashioned suits and turn\r\nof the century moustaches. In the background there is the crying game\r\nthat is Balkanian music: liturgy and folk and elegy combined.
