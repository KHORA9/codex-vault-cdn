It has been the Author's endeavour to attain\r\nthis object, partly by a condensed account of the events of the last few\r\nyears, partly by a collection of suitable extracts from documents\r\nreferring to this crisis. Choice in the last items has been confined to\r\nthe most important ones. Touching the Consular negotiations only the\r\ndiscussions on the most disputed points are given.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with some of the statements in Nansen's brochure the author\r\ndoes not intend a exhaustive criticism of the said work, but has only\r\ntried to show, by a few instances, the treatment pure and distinct facts\r\nhave been submitted to, in these days, by Norwegian agitation. The number\r\nof instances could be multiplied many times over. If the following\r\nrepresentation has caught the tone of present feeling in Sweden, it must\r\nbe excused. The Author is, however, convinced that this has not\r\ndisadvantageously affected his account of the actual facts of the case.\r\n\r\nUpsala.

Its origin, in\r\nreality, dates as far back as the foundation of the Union itself.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The efforts to give Norway a better position in the Union._]\r\n\r\nThe original cause of the agitating union disputes has been that Sweden,\r\nfrom the very commencement of the Union, has internationally borne the\r\nresponsibility for the same, in other words, conducted the political\r\naffairs of both Kingdoms. The inequality produced hereby, the Norwegians\r\non their part have striven to efface. Sweden has also for a long time\r\nshown herself willing to establish full equality in the Union, at the\r\nsame time that she has accommodated herself to Norway in questions of\r\ndetail. As far back as 1835 it was acknowledged, on the part of Sweden,\r\nthat Norway's position in the Union was not in accordance with the claims\r\nof equity. Thus by a Royal Decree that year the Norwegian Minister of\r\nState at Stockholm was admitted into the Swedish so-called Ministerial\r\nCouncil to take part in foreign matters which concerned Norway. In 1839\r\nthe first great Union-Committee was formed, and both in this one, and two\r\nlater--the last 1895-98--Norway was offered from the Swedish side\r\ncomplete equality in the Union on certain conditions. Added to this\r\nSweden has on several occasions granted partial concessions. Some have\r\nbeen accepted by Norway--as for instance the law passed in 1844\r\nconcerning equality in Government Symbols etc. etc.--others again were\r\nrefused--as the offer in 1885 and 1891 of increased influence in the\r\nadministration of Foreign affairs. If offers of equality worded in more\r\ngeneral terms are added--as in 1893 and during the present year--,\r\nNANSEN'S characterising Sweden's Union policy as »90 years' labour to\r\nprocure a supremacy for Sweden»,--ought to appear in its true\r\ncolours[2:1].\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Unauthorized accusations against Sweden for endeavouring to\r\ngain the supremacy._]\r\n\r\nThe accusations against Sweden for endeavouring to acquire the supremacy\r\nhave, time after time, arisen from a mixture of various matters, partly\r\nthe different conceptions of the legal character of the existing Union,\r\npartly the different programmes for the reformation of the Union.\r\n\r\nOwing to the very indistinct and confused wording in the legal documents\r\nof the Act of Union the Swedish and Norwegian conceptions of the Union\r\nitself have finally become so antagonistic to each other, that the\r\nunionistic transactions have, in an excessive degree, taken the character\r\nof a continual judicial process, and the real questions have been more or\r\nless ignored[2:2]. Swedish Policy on its part has always maintained that\r\nSweden's supremacy in the Union is based on legal grounds. It has\r\nespecially insisted that the administration of Foreign affairs was, from\r\nthe first, placed in Sweden's hands[2:3], and this Swedish standpoint has\r\nalso been acknowledged as the right one by the most eminent of Norwegian\r\nwriters on State law[3:1]. But of late those on the Norwegian Left Side\r\nhave made stronger and stronger efforts to prove, that the order existed\r\non no legal grounds, that Norway, as a Sovereign Kingdom, had the right,\r\nfor instance, to create an entire Foreign Office of its own. And under\r\nthis influence the Norwegian sensitiveness has in Sweden's defence of her\r\nconception of Union Law persisted more and more in seeing insulting\r\n»designs of supremacy».\r\n\r\nMeanwhile future prospects and reform programmes have had little to do\r\nwith the Swedish conception of the legal character of the Union. The most\r\nextreme representatives of the so-called supremacy partizans--to\r\nmention one, the late professor OSCAR ALIN--have on different occasions\r\nmaintained reform programmes, built on the principle of perfect equality\r\nwithin the Union, and it must be asserted that _no Swedish political\r\nparty in recent times has refused perfect equality to Norway_[3:2].\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The different programmes of Sweden and Norway for reforming\r\nthe Union._]\r\n\r\nThat the result seems to become the rupture of the Union, and not the\r\nreorganization of the same has depended on more and more insurmountable\r\noppositions in opinions concerning _the manner_ and _the aim_ for a\r\nreform.\r\n\r\nSweden has, as a rule, preferred the _entire_ reorganization, Norway the\r\n_partial_--the consequence being, for instance, the struggles in the\r\nso-called Stadtholder disputes in the sixties of the last century. Sweden\r\nhas held her standpoint, especially as she has considered it to the\r\ninterest of the Union to insist on creating perfect equality by\r\nconcessions also from Norway, and it seemed that these demands could not\r\ngain sufficient consideration unless the reorganization was\r\ncomplete[4:1].\r\n\r\nSweden has furthermore insisted on _negotiations_ and _agreements_, as\r\nthe natural road to reform; how Norway has more and more allowed herself\r\nto take matters into her own hands, shall now be more clearly explained.\r\n\r\nAbove all, however, the differences of opinion respecting the _aim_ of\r\nthe reform have become more and more pronounced. Sweden has adhered to a\r\nUnion, which outworldly represents a perfect unity, and tried to create a\r\nsafe and secure Union. Norway has, by degrees, in her ever increasing\r\noverwrought sensitiveness, developed her reform programme towards a\r\npurely personal union, behind which the rupture of the Union has stood as\r\nthe main object in view.\r\n\r\nThe connection of the Norwegian Union with the inner party struggles in\r\nNorway, has had a disastrous effect on the development of the Norwegian\r\nprogramme, especially since 1885.\r\n\r\nThrough the Constitutional Crisis in 1884, when the Royal Powers were\r\nforced--practically if not legally--to capitulate in essentials to\r\nthe orthodox parliamentarism, the Norwegian party champions became in\r\nneed of new programmes upon which to fling themselves. It was then, that\r\nthe Norwegian radicals through the demand for their own Minister of State\r\nfor Foreign Affairs cast a firebrand into the very midst of the Norwegian\r\npeople[5:1], who to that time had stood unanimous towards the claim of a\r\nmutual Foreign Minister of State for the Union. In the struggle for the\r\npolitical ascendency chauvinistic strongwords became more and more rife.\r\nThe national sensitiveness, already considerable, became excited to the\r\nutmost under the influence of the suggestive eloquence of BJÖRNSON and\r\nother agitators. The suspiciousness disaffection towards Sweden\r\nincreased. The Swedish brethren were pointed at by BJÖRNSON as the only\r\nenemy Norway had, and even in the schoolrooms and school-books their\r\n(Swedish) hereditary enemy was spoken of with curses. Simultaneously the\r\n»Norwegians of the Future» buried themselves deeper and deeper in the\r\nstudy of »Ancient Glorious Norway». Imagination was fed on Norwegian\r\nheroic Sagas and Viking exploits, and the ancient National Saint of\r\nNorway, Olaf the Holy, was unearthed from his long-forgotten hiding place\r\nfor renewed worship[5:2].\r\n\r\nThis overwrought sentimental policy, of course, caused national pride and\r\nall its requisite claims, to raise a cloud over Sweden and the Union, and\r\nthe essential principles in the Union Question became of less and less\r\nimportance. How totally void of essential principles the recent Norwegian\r\nUnion Policy has been, is most obvious in the matter of effacing the\r\nUnion Symbol from the mercantile flag having for a long period of years\r\nplayed a dominating rôle in Norwegian party politics[6:1]. It became the\r\nmore and more hopeless task of Sweden and the Union King to maintain the\r\ncause of the Union without support from the dominant left party in\r\nNorway. The Norwegian radical party in their blind fanaticism were\r\nscarcely capable of rational action with any feeling of real political\r\nresponsibility; the friendly attitude towards Russia as their friend in\r\nneed, of BJÖRNSON and other radicals, was quite sufficient proof of this.\r\nIt is true, that one party--the Norwegian Right Side--, for a long\r\ntime inclined to a more favourable view of the Union, has supported the\r\nKing in his efforts to oppose the dissolving of the Union, but in the\r\nfight for the political supremacy, the power of nationalism over minds\r\nhas gradually undermined its position as a pillar of the Union, and at\r\nthe present period of violently agitated feeling, the party has almost\r\nentirely vanished from the »national junction.»\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Sweden's later Union policy._]\r\n\r\nDuring the process of this chauvinistic hysteria, Swedish politicians\r\nhave naturally had an exceedingly delicate problem to solve. On one point\r\nopinion in Sweden has been unanimous. It has emphatically refused to\r\naccept a mere personal Union as a solution of the question. This on two\r\ngrounds: one for the Union, the other for the Nation. The interests of\r\nthe Union imperatively demanded outward unity, in order that the Union\r\nmight be able to fulfil its purpose preserving security to the\r\nScandinavian Peninsula in relation to Foreign powers. National interest\r\nsaw in a personal union, and generally in every more radical rupture of\r\nthe bonds of the Union, a risk that the influence of Sweden would thereby\r\nbecome unduly lessened. For if Sovereign power became the only essential\r\nbond of Union, there would be the risk of the balance of power drifting\r\ninto the hands of the Storthing (especially after the events of 1884 when\r\nthe Sovereign power of the King was weakened), a risk that has at the\r\npresent conjuncture of affairs already made itself felt.\r\n\r\nBut if Sweden has thus been unanimous in demanding a joint\r\nadministration of Foreign affairs, it might be found within the range of\r\npossibilities, for the sake of peace and quietness, to grant concessions\r\nin certain matters, which in reality from an union point of view seemed\r\nboth unnecessary and undesirable. They may have complain as much as they\r\nlike of the Norwegian national obstinacy, of their sickly fears of any\r\nsort of »_confusion_»; their inability to comprehend the requirements of\r\nthe Union; it remained, however, a fact, that it was necessary to take\r\ninto account, and indeed, it was a duty to respect it to a certain\r\nextent, as it originated in no slight degree from feelings fed by the\r\nsubordinate position Norway had always held in years gone by. Swedish\r\npolicy had thus to face two alternatives, either firmly and inexorably to\r\ninsist on the Swedish demands for the amendment of the Union, conscious\r\nthat they were in the interests of the Union, and like wise the real\r\ninterest of Norway; or make a compromise, be contented with a partially\r\ndisorganized Union, which by its bonds outwardly at least, preserved the\r\nappearance of the Scandinavian Peninsula's unity to Europe. The currents\r\nof the Union Policy in Sweden have swayed between these two\r\npossibilities, but if we follow it along the whole of its course, we\r\nshall see that Swedish Policy has always made a way for concessions. In\r\nthe Union Committee of 1867 the Swedish members insisted on a Union\r\nParliament as the stipulation of a joint Foreign Office; the Swedish\r\nmajority in the Committe of 1898 abandoned that decision and contented\r\nitself with a joint Court of impeachment as a forum for appeal against\r\nthe mutual Foreign Minister of the Union, but it insisted on maintaining\r\nthe necessity of having mutual Consular representatives; during the\r\npresent year, the King and the Riksdag have unanimously approved of the\r\nprinciples of a new arrangement with separate Consuls for Sweden and\r\nNorway. It is perhaps too soon to now judge between the lines followed by\r\nSwedish Union politicians, but in any case, it can scarcely be a matter\r\nof surprise that Swedish Policy has but slowly and gradually given up its\r\nclaims. In order to preserve harmony, Sweden has been forced to do it, on\r\naccount of the responsibility she once undertook on behalf of the Union,\r\nbut no direct national interests have influenced the concessions and the\r\nenticing reward--harmony within the Union, the prospect of getting\r\nNorway honestly to meet her half way--has been sufficiently uncertain,\r\nin fact, the above mentioned concessions have seemed to possess a\r\nremarkable faculty for drawing forward new claims.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2:1] NANSEN (English edition). The same author writes (page 62):\r\n»Finally in 1903(!) the Swedish Government declared openly that the\r\npresent arrangement was not in accordance with Norway's just demands for\r\nequality in the Union.» How such a statement can be made is simply\r\nincomprehensible.\r\n\r\n[2:2] How the Norwegian Storthing, made up as it is, of large numbers of\r\nlawyers, has contributed to this, is well known to all.\r\n\r\n[2:3] On this account, it has especially been vindicated that the Act of\r\nUnion plainly indicates a joint Foreign Policy, which is scarcely\r\npossible without a joint Foreign Administration; that the same Act of\r\nUnion only acknowledges the Swedish Foreign Minister of State as the head\r\nof the Foreign Administration for the Union; that in the »Eidswold\r\nConstitution», at the commencement of the Union, the paragraph referring\r\nto the Norwegian Foreign Minister of State was simply ignored. This last\r\ninconvenient fact is interpreted by the modern Norwegian theory of State\r\nLaw as implying, that the Norwegian Constitution has left the\r\nadministration of Foreign affairs to the King personally, who, in his\r\nturn on the grounds of this authority has placed it in the hands of the\r\nSwedish Minister of Foreign Affairs. NANSEN (page 49 and following.) The\r\nartfulness of this legal construction becomes immediately obvious. It is\r\nexceedingly remarkable also to find that Norwegian parliamentarism can\r\ncommit such a blasphemy towards the Constitution, that it has confered a\r\nposition of importance on the King Himself.\r\n\r\n[3:1] The Norwegian Right Side (Conservative) has not either emphatically\r\ndisputed the Swedish conception.\r\n\r\n[3:2] Illustrative of the Norwegian way of confusing the Swedish _legal\r\nconception_ and the Swedish _amendment programme_ in the Union question\r\nis an expression of NANSEN (page 61). According to him »the Swedish\r\ngovernment as late as 1891 appeared, as already mentioned, inclined to\r\ndeny Norway every right of taking part in the administration of foreign\r\naffairs», while in 1893 the Swedish Government offered a joint Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs for the Union. The state of the case was, that the\r\nSwedish Government in 1891 offered Norway _increase_ of influence in\r\nForeign affairs, but in motioning this offer the Swedish legal point of\r\nview was maintained, that the administration of Foreign (diplomatic)\r\naffairs for the Union by the Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs was\r\nfounded on legal right. Reflections arise of themselves.\r\n\r\n[4:1] Sweden has especially tried to annul the paragraph 25 of Norway's\r\nfundamental law which limits the duty of its Union defence. According to\r\nthis paragraph, the Yeomanry and other Norwegian troops, that cannot be\r\nreckoned as belonging to the line, may not be employed outside the\r\nboundaries of the Kingdom. This law has proved so much the more\r\npernicous, as the Norwegians by their recruiting regulations have\r\nilloyally withdrawn from the Union-defence part of their fighting forces,\r\nby outrageously entering into the line a limited number only of the\r\nannual classes of recruits.\r\n\r\n[5:1] Mr HAGERUP also affirmed openly in the Storthing of 1904 that the\r\nUnion question had in quite too high a degree come to be regarded by the\r\nNorwegian parties as a workshop of weapons for elections campaigns.\r\n\r\n[5:2] We get a glimpse of this romance, in the midst of the ultra modern\r\n»glorious» revolution. At a large meeting at Hamar it was decreed, that\r\nthe new King should bear a name after one on the ancient Kings of Norway.\r\nIn a festival number of a »Vordens Gang» in honour of the revolution we\r\nfind printed a »Psalm on Olaf's Day» written by BJÖRNSON.\r\n\r\n[6:1] That Norway in carrying out the law (1899) respecting the flag,\r\nbroke an agreement with Sweden made in 1844, was of course only in\r\nconformity with everything else.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Consul question._]\r\n\r\nThe Consular Question is a red thread running through the history of the\r\nUnion struggles during the last fourteen years--\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The change in the Swedish Constitution of 1885._]\r\n\r\nThe Norwegians on their part in attempting to defend the way in which the\r\nLeft Side started the Union Policy in the beginning of 1890, always\r\nallude to what happened in Sweden in 1885[8:1].\r\n\r\nWhat was it then that happened in 1885?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Norway's attitude to the same._]\r\n\r\nBy the amendment of the Swedish Constitution, the Prime Minister was also\r\nin the Ministerial Council (for Foreign affairs), so that the Council\r\ninstead of having only two members, ever after had three, the object\r\nbeing to guarantee that the Cabinet Council should be more fully\r\nrepresented in they the in administration of Foreign affairs. Now, as\r\npreviously mentioned, by a Royal Decree in 1835 the Norwegian Prime\r\nMinister at Stockholm was admitted into the Ministerial Council when\r\nforeign affairs affecting the two Kingdoms were negotiated. Thus Norway\r\nby the proposed Constitutional amendment was supposed to occupy a\r\nsomewhat more unfavourable position than formerly. But Sweden immediately\r\noffers a more extended representation in the Council for Foreign affairs,\r\nwhich offer, however, is, for some inexplicable reason, refused by Norway\r\non formal grounds. In the year 1891 this offer was renewed, but then the\r\nmajority on the Left Side of the Storthing finds a very excellent reason\r\nfor refusing the proposition, by pointing out, that the Swedish Council\r\nin motioning towards the proposed amendment in the Act of Union (not in\r\nthe proposed paragraph itself) maintains the stand-point that Sweden's\r\nleadership in the administration of Foreign affairs is founded on legal\r\nright[9:1].\r\n\r\nBut something else is said to have happened in 1885, which was not\r\ndiscovered by the Norwegian side till several years later, and which,\r\nbeing exposed by the Norwegian agitation in these days, offers to we\r\nSwedes the delights of novelty. Formerly foreign affairs were supposed to\r\nbe administered chiefly by the Swedish King personally, and the Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs is said to have stood in a more personal relation to\r\nthe King. Foreign Affairs under such circumstances were supposed to be\r\nmore impartially treated, so that even Norway's lawful interests could\r\nreceive due attention. But by the amendment of the Constitution of 1885\r\nthe Swedish Foreign Minister would be entirely subservient to Swedish\r\nParliamentarism, which made the employment of the Swedish Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs, in the protection of Norwegian interests, still more\r\ndissatisfactory for Norway than formerly. This is pretended to have\r\nbecome the source of the last twenty year's Union struggle[9:2]. Now the\r\nstate of the case is this, _the Foreign Minister's parliamentary\r\nresponsibility has not been increased by the amendment of the\r\nConstitution in 1885_. Formerly he was--just as he is now--\r\nresponsible, as reporter, in the first place for all _resolutions_ in\r\nForeign affairs. The point that was formally confirmed by law in 1885\r\nwas, that the Minister for Foreign Affairs should also _prepare_ matters\r\nconcerning foreign affairs. According to the older version of the\r\nparagraph that was altered that year (1885), the King was invested with\r\ngreater rights in reference to that side of the administration of foreign\r\naffairs. Thus the amendment of the Constitution in 1885 only effected\r\nthat the actual influence of the Minister for Foreign Affairs on Sweden's\r\nforeign policy was brought into harmony with the formal responsibility he\r\nheld in all cases for Sweden's Foreign policy. It may be added that this\r\nconstitutional amendment only confirmed the old practice, as the Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs was formerly regularly employed to prepare matters\r\nconcerning foreign affairs, and that his previous employment in the\r\npreparation of foreign affairs was naturally carried out under\r\nobservation of the responsibility in which he stood for the resolutions\r\ntaken, and was not inspired by any mysterious personal relations to the\r\nKing. The whole of this Norwegian notion of the fatal influence on the\r\nUnion in this constitutional amendment, is, in fact, nothing but a\r\nmanufactured theory containing no real grounds whatsoever.\r\n\r\nNow it must be observed that Norway had formerly no regular parliamentary\r\ncontrol over foreign affairs, _but the Swedish offer of 1891 was just\r\nintended to give the Norwegian Storthing the right to this control, to be\r\nexercised under the same conditions as those in the Swedish Diet_. But\r\nthe Storthing refused (as previously mentioned) the Swedish offer; it\r\npreferred to keep the quarrel alive, and in order to do this, it was\r\nnecessary to be able to refer to Swedish oppression.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Norwegian radicals' method of taking matters into their\r\nhands._]\r\n\r\nThe Swedish offer being thus refused, the Norwegian Union politics in\r\n1891 took a new turn. The road was already pointed out by the veteran\r\nleader of the Left Side (separatists) JOHAN SVERDRUP; it was indicated\r\n»to take matters into our own hands». The system was founded on the\r\nNorwegian Left Side State-law theory, according to which Norway, as a\r\nSovereign state, was entitled to its own Minister for Foreign Affairs,\r\nits own diplomatic representatives and consuls, all of which was proved\r\nwith much craft by the Constitution of Norway and the Act of Union\r\nbetween Sweden and Norway. The right to one and all to which Norway, as a\r\nSovereign power, was entitled, should now be realized, independently and\r\nboldly, without consulting Sweden. By Royal Decree, the Storting having\r\ngranted the means, a Norwegian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Norwegian\r\nDiplomatic Representatives and consuls should be appointed without delay\r\nin the Norwegian Council. Thus the lines of the future politics of Norway\r\nwere fixed by the Separatists[10:1].\r\n\r\nIt is obvious, that the notion of the one Kingdom in a Union being able,\r\nof its own accord without consulting the other Kingdom, to alter and\r\ndissolve the bonds of Union, is theoretically inimical to the Union\r\nitself, and in fact shows enormous disloyalty to the other half of the\r\nUnion. A _Union_ policy of this sort is, of course, in spirit, completely\r\nrevolutionary, and at the outset has no place within the Union.\r\nNevertheless it has been followed under continued official protestations\r\nof fidelity to the Union--the last speech of this sort was heard a\r\nshort time ago, when the well known road was fully marked out, right away\r\nto the object so long hovering in view. This is not the only piece of\r\nduplicity in Norwegian Union policy of whech Sweden has had to complain.\r\n\r\nThere was a cautious beginning with »their own Consuls»; it was too\r\nventuresome a task to begin the system at once with the question of their\r\nown Minister for Foreign Affairs.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The real innecessity of having separate Consuls._]\r\n\r\nOn the side of Norway it has been claimed that the mercantile interests\r\nof Norway demanded a Consular Service of its own[11:1]. In reality, it is\r\nan indisputable fact, even acknowledged by Norwegians, that no\r\nessentially practical inconvenience has been caused by the system of\r\nhaving a joint Consular Service. The Circles most affected by the matter\r\nin Norway, Commercial men and ship-owners--were in opposition for a\r\nlong time; not even in 1891 did the separatists venture to lay the\r\nConsular Committee's deliberations on the subject before the mercantile\r\nauthorities. One Norwegian, who was well competent to judge of the\r\nmatter, acknowledged openly, when the question was first broached, that\r\n»the grounds of the proposition for a complete separation as being of\r\nbenefit to the shipping, commerce, and industry of the country, are so\r\nweak, that it would be impossible for them except, through persistent\r\nagitation to gain conviction, either among the classes most interested,\r\nor amongst the masses of the people». There are principally two reasons\r\nfor the proposed reform, first that Sweden and Norway have a different\r\nTariff-System, secondly, the frequent rivalry between Swedish and\r\nNorwegian trade articles of export. The first reason is baseless, as the\r\ndifferent Tariff-Systems are of importance chiefly for the imports, and\r\nnot for the exports[12:1]; the second reason loses its chief point by the\r\nfact that consuls are not commercial agents, that it is not their\r\nbusiness to promote trade for private individuals, but only to give\r\nreports of the possibilities of trading with different countries. It is\r\nalso worthy of mention, that in Sweden not the slightest wish has been\r\nexpressed in this direction, though at present the majority of the\r\nConsuls abroad are Norwegians. And as regards the much-talked of fears,\r\nthat in the administration of the Consular Service by the Foreign Office,\r\npartiality might be exercised in the interests of Sweden, the fact _that\r\nfor a long time past the whole of the mercantile portion of the Consuls'\r\nduties have, on Norway's side, been performed by one of the Norwegian\r\nGovernment Departements_, proves how vain those fears were.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The real object of raising the consular question._]\r\n\r\nNorwegian separatists, among others MICHELSEN himself, long ago, in a\r\nmoment of rare sincerity, have acknowledged that other motives besides\r\nthe practical have been at the root of the claim for reform. A Norwegian\r\nConsular Service meant, in itself, a step in the direction of the rupture\r\nof the bonds of Union, and was therefore even then an object worth\r\nstriving for. But it was also openly declared, that a Norwegian Consular\r\nService would necessarily be succeeded by a Norwegian diplomatic\r\nrepresentation and a Norwegian Minister for Foreign Affairs. »Directly\r\nthey have got the wedge fixed into the small end», wrote in 1892\r\nPresident HANS FORSSELL, »they will try to persuade us that there will be\r\nno danger in letting them drive it in a bit». Above all they considered\r\nthat a Norwegian Consular Service would by degrees disorganize the\r\nadministration of the Foreign Office, and on the grounds of the\r\ndominating rôle interests of economy play in the Foreign politics of our\r\nday, it would by degrees expand into a regular Norwegian Foreign Office.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Want of Union motives for Consular reform._]\r\n\r\nThe chief characteristic of this programme is the total absence of any\r\nmotive for it from a Union point of view. Modern Norwegian Nationalism\r\nhas only really thought of Sweden and Norway, but not of the Union and\r\nits claims. Whenever Sweden has ventured to advocate the cause of the\r\nUnion, Norway has begun to talk of the interests of Sweden. If, at any\r\ntime, the claims of the Union have been discussed in Norway, they have\r\nusually been identical with those of Norway. The interests of the Union\r\ndemanded that Norway, without further parley, got what its national\r\nsensitive feeling was pleased to decree as the Sovereign Norway's right.\r\nThat is about the gist of the matter. The Norwegian policy has by degrees\r\nbecome blind to the fact, that the interests of the Union ought to demand\r\na subordination of the inclination to decide arbitrarily on points\r\ntouching the Union, both for the sake of Sweden and--of Norway.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Misinterpretation of the King's opposition._]\r\n\r\nWhen therefore the King, in the interests of _the Union_, at first\r\nopposed both the Consular reform itself and the manner of carrying it\r\nout, they did not see the King of Norway, or the King of the Union, only\r\nthe King of Sweden, the veto of the King of Norway was called the Swedish\r\nveto against the rightful claims of Norway. This dishonest doctrine has\r\ngradually poisoned the minds of the people of Norway, and it is this,\r\nthat has brought about the rupture of the Union.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The raising of the Consular question in 1891._]\r\n\r\nUnder strong protest from the Norwegian Right Side (Conservative), which\r\nat that time looked upon a separate Consular Service under a mutual\r\ndiplomatic administration as introducing something hitherto unheard of in\r\nthe annals of history, the consular question was brought to the decision\r\nby the Norwegian Left Side. By an order of the Storthing, the method was\r\nestablished: the Consular question was exclusively a Norwegian matter,\r\nwhich must be treated and decided upon by Norwegian authorities of State\r\nalone; on the other hand the _winding up_ of the joint Consular Service\r\nwould be a cause of negotiations with Sweden. In plain words, the Royal\r\nDecree must be given in a Norwegian Cabinet Council, not in a so-called\r\nJoint Cabinet consisting of both Swedish and Norwegian members, which\r\naccording to the Act of Union must decide in all questions »concerning\r\nthe two Kingdoms[14:1].» And this one-sided right of decision was\r\nmaintained in spite of the common Consular statutes--the last in 1886\r\n--having been confirmed by a Joint Cabinet, and in spite of the fact\r\nthat these statutes prescribed the settlement of Consular Affairs in that\r\nCouncil alone. Added to this, the relations of the future Norwegian\r\nConsular Service to the Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs and\r\ndiplomatic representatives had also to be arranged. This matter might\r\ncertainly be considered, to belong to the negotiations relating to the\r\nwinding up of the joint Consular Service. But if Norway resolved that a\r\nseparate Consular Service should be established within a given time, it\r\nwould be Norway's prerogative to dictate the conditions of winding it up;\r\nNorway might without further ceremony withdraw a portion of its Foreign\r\naffairs from the joint Foreign administration.\r\n\r\nThrough its leader, EMIL STANG, the Norwegian Conservatives supported the\r\nUnion King's view that the matter was as yet too imperfectly developed,\r\nand that it must be decided on in a joint Cabinet. But in 1892 the\r\nStorthing resolved, with a majority of 14 votes, on the establishment of\r\na Norwegian Consular Service. The King was prepared to refuse the\r\nsanction to this, in a Norwegian Cabinet Council, and then and there\r\nbegan the conflict between King and Council, as witnessed by the events\r\nof later times. The character of this conflict may be mentioned already\r\nhere, as Norway, in fact, was even then, in 1892, on the eve of the\r\nrevolution, which has now broken out.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _»The King and the Ministry» according to the Norwegian\r\nConstitution._]\r\n\r\nWhen the Constitution of Norway was framed in 1814, the Continent was but\r\nlittle acquainted with the pure parliamentarism, with a ruling Council\r\nand a powerless King. The Constitution is instead based on the theory of\r\nthe division of the state power into three organs, and this is plainly\r\nstated in the division of the Constitution. The King's veto over legal\r\nquestions is only suspensive, but he is not represented as the helpless\r\ntool of Storthing and Council. The Cabinet Council is certainly\r\nresponsible to the Storthing, but only for its own advice, not for the\r\nKing's Decrees. The King is legally bound to listen to the opinions of\r\nhis ministers, but the right of making Decrees according to his own\r\njudgment, is expressly reserved to him. Nor does the Constitution of\r\nNorway recognize the law of refusing countersignature, which is found for\r\ninstance in the Swedish Constitution. In 1814 the Storthing explicitly\r\nrefused a proposition to give the Cabinet Council this right, declaring\r\nthat the King ought not to be deprived of all his privileges. All the\r\nKing's Decrees must be countersigned by one of the Prime Ministers, but\r\nthis countersignature implies only the responsibility for the agreement\r\nof the records with the resolutions taken. The greatest Norwegian writers\r\non State Law, have acknowledged that this is Norwegian National\r\nLaw[15:1]. Furthermore the Constitution originally did not recognize\r\nsomething else remarkable for modern parliamentarism: the Ministers were\r\nnot even allowed to attend the debates of the Storthing. Then came the\r\nCrisis of 1884, when the Norwegian Radicals with the Court of impeachment\r\na weapon, forced the King to capitulate, forced him to summon a Radical\r\nMinistry, and to sanction an amendment of the Constitution, by which the\r\nMinistery were allowed to attend the debates in the Storthing. By this\r\nmeans, the modern parliamentarism, with all its claims, elbowed its way\r\ninto Norwegian State life. But the old prescriptions as to the\r\nresponsibility of the Cabinet Council, were retained, and they must\r\nnaturally be interpreted as of old. The new parliamentary interpretation\r\nof these prescriptions of responsibility, especially the right of\r\nrefusing countersignature, was opposed by the King, who adhered to the\r\nold only possible forms.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The development of the Consular question._]\r\n\r\nEven in 1892 the Radical Cabinet STEEN did not venture to carry the\r\nConsular question to an extreme. They were contented to play with fire.\r\nBefore the King found an opportunity to give his definite answer to the\r\nconsular question, the Cabinet retired. The Ministerial strike recently\r\nset on the political stage, was even then in the perspective. But the\r\nKing having vainly tried to form a Conservative Ministry and matters\r\nbecoming serious, a retreat was sounded, the Storthing itself taking the\r\ninitiative, this time, strange to say, receiving the hint from Mr\r\nMICHELSEN. The requests of the Ministers to resign were withdrawn, and\r\nthe Consular Question was postponed to a future date. The Norwegian\r\nmasses were not as yet sufficiently impregnated with the gospel of the\r\ndissolution of the Union--and Norway was not yet armed for defence.\r\n\r\nThe following year the same tale began afresh. The Storthing resolved on\r\nhaving a separate Consular Service, the Ministers sent in their requests\r\nto resign, to avoid, as they declared, rousing a constitutional dispute\r\non the countersignature question which might bring about consequences\r\n»that scarcely any other political question had aroused in our present\r\nconstitution». This time the Conservatives stepped into the breach on\r\nbehalf of the King and the Union. For two years The Cabinet STANG opposed\r\na furious Storthing, while the King was powerless to form a parliamentary\r\nRadical Ministry on reasonable terms. This conflict naturally produced\r\nintense excitement, and the Radicals, of course, saw in the King's\r\nopposition, Sweden's and the King's of Sweden, not the King's of the\r\nUnited Kingdoms fighting a battle against the destruction of the Union.\r\nIt is in this way that the Consular Question became magnified into a\r\nquestion of National honour. The blow given to their honour by the\r\ndisloyalty of the Radicals to the _Union_ was entirely ignored. The\r\nConsular question became by degrees, the chief National question of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The position in 1895._]\r\n\r\nIn the Spring of 1895 the situation in Norway was such that a complete\r\nstandstill was threatened, and all sorts of extravagant plans were mooted\r\non the Norwegian Radical Side. It was then that in limited Swedish\r\nConservatives circles a plan was said to exist for making Norway come to\r\nan agreeable settlement of the Union question, by main force. This is a\r\nmatter impossible to decide. These reports spread like wildfire, and had\r\nthe effect of oil upon fire. And now at last Norway begins to think of\r\nher defence which of late years she has neglected.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Union Committee 1895-1908._]\r\n\r\nThe Norwegians meanwhile gave in as Norway was not ready. The Storthing\r\nin Norway also consented to what Sweden had all along endeavoured to\r\nobtain, viz. a general settlement. The Union Committee 1895-1898 effected\r\na couple of year's truce; any real results were not to be expected. The\r\nNorwegian Radicals had other plans than a reasonable settlement of the\r\nUnion question; its representatives in the Committee were bound by their\r\nparty programme, and insisted on having their own Minister for Foreign\r\naffairs. On the other side, the two representatives of the Swedish\r\nConservatives maintained the demand for a Union Parliament which the\r\nNorwegians in the previous Union Committee had refused. The Swedish and\r\nNorwegian majorities were very nearly balanced. They were united in the\r\nopinion that the Union necessarily demanded a joint Minister for Foreign\r\naffairs, but differed in everything else on several points. For instance,\r\nthe Norwegian majority, characteristically would not agree to limit the\r\npossibility for Norway (on the grounds of paragraph 25 in the\r\nConstitution) of withdrawing of her own accord, a greater or smaller\r\nportion of Norwegian troops from the defending forces of the Union[18:1].\r\nIn the Consular question there were also differences. The Swedish members\r\nwere unanimous in insisting on a joint Consular Service for both\r\nKingdoms. The Norwegian majority preferred, from all points of view, a\r\njoint Consular Service to a separate one for each Kingdom, and strongly\r\nemphasized the point that in all circumstances the consuls ought to be\r\npersonally and immediately under the control of the Minister for Foreign\r\naffairs, as the limits in the sphere of operations between the Consuls\r\nand the Diplomatic Officials became more and more indefined. But with\r\nevident respect to the opposing Norwegian opinions, it tried to regulate\r\nthe Consular Service, by joint terminable laws, nevertheless, so worded,\r\nthat not till the lapse of 15 years, the Kingdom that so desired, might\r\nhave the right to dissolve the joint Consular Service[18:2].\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Norway prepares again to the Consular Question._]\r\n\r\nThe Union Committee having failed, the Norwegian Radicals prepared for\r\nanother attack on the old lines. By passing the Flag Bill, they prepared\r\nto renew negotiations on the Consular Question, while, at the same time,\r\nthey were busily engaged in strengthening their defence and raising on\r\nthe boundaries rumoured fortresses against Sweden. The Under Secretary of\r\nState, Dr. SIGURD IBSEN, instituted an inquiry as to the feasibility of\r\nhaving a separate Consular Service in conjunction with the existing\r\nForeign administration. It was on this point that the Minister for\r\nForeign affairs, for the time being, Mr. LAGERHEIM, made a proposal, the\r\nconsequences of which brought about the present crisis.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[8:1] Compare NANSEN (page 48 and following).\r\n\r\n[9:1] The Norwegians, as aforesaid, have generally looked upon Sweden's\r\nmaintaining its conception of the Union law as something very criminal;\r\nthis has been Norway's right alone.\r\n\r\n[9:2] Compare NANSEN (page 54). »The change in the Swedish Constitution\r\nin 1885 has therefore become the principal cause of the last twenty\r\nyears' strife in the union.»\r\n\r\n[10:1] On the Norwegian side, it has been said, that Sweden in 1885\r\nadopted the same method, when, by changing the Swedish Constitution by\r\nthemselves, they reorganized the Council for Foreign affairs. It must,\r\nhowever, be observed, that, in this, Sweden is supported by its own\r\nright, as acknowledged by the foremost Norwegian writers on state law and\r\nNorwegian Conservatives, to undertake the management of foreign policy.\r\nThis legal stand-point had been adopted in 1835, when a resolution was\r\npassed in the _Swedish_ Cabinet to admit the Norwegian Minister of State\r\nto the Ministeral Council. The Norwegian claim to participate in the\r\nrevision of the Swedish Constitution is, however, unwarrantable, as\r\nNorway, in the indisputably unionistic Stadtholder question in 1860\r\nmaintained that Sweden was not warranted in interfering when revisions or\r\nchanges were made in the Norwegian Constitution.\r\n\r\n[11:1] Compare NANSEN (page 68 and following).\r\n\r\n[12:1] It is a singular coincidence, that Norway in these days, when it\r\nhas brought the Consular question to a climax, has begun to carry out a\r\ngeneral rise in the Fiscal rates; the mercantile interests of »the land\r\nof Free Trade» Norway evidently do not lie so very deep after all.\r\n\r\n[14:1] The question as to when a matter shall be discussed in a Joint\r\nCabinet or not, has not been the smallest of the stumbling blocks in the\r\nthorny path of the Union negotiations. In Norway, to quote Mr HAGERUP,\r\nthere has been quite a »sickly» fear of having matters settled there. On\r\nthe Norwegian Left Side they have defended the opinion, that only those\r\nmatters which, being expressly mentioned in the Act of Union, as being\r\ndistinctively Union-matters ought to be brought there. In Sweden it has\r\nbeen held, that the Act of Union has no power to give an exhaustive\r\naccount as to what matters belong to the Union and which do not. Whether\r\nit can be considered a matter which concerns both the Kingdoms depends\r\nentirely on the exact nature of the matter itself. _This latter\r\nconception has been adopted of old._\r\n\r\n[15:1] Compare No. I §§ 5, 15, 30, 31.\r\n\r\n[18:1] The Swedish majority had contemplated a provision in the Act of\r\nUnion, wherevy it became incumbent for both Kingdoms to place a fixed\r\nminimum of fighting forces to the disposition of the Union.\r\n\r\n[18:2] NANSEN says (page 71) »Divisions arose partly over the resistance\r\nfrom the Swedish side to the unanimous demand of the Norwegian delegates\r\nfor a separate Consular Service.» This is, as plainly apparent, an\r\nextremely modified version of the truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _His Excellency Mr. Lagerheim's Proposal._]\r\n\r\nHis Excellency Mr. LAGERHEIM'S proposal implied an attempt to settle the\r\nConsular Question itself, by retaining the existing Foreign\r\nAdministration and dissolving the joint Consular Service. By doing this,\r\nhe plainly foresaw that the Consular Question would inevitably be raised\r\nafresh on the part of Norway. It was necessary therefore to lead the work\r\nof reform in the quiet paths of Union negotiations, in order to prevent\r\nthe old attempts on Norway's side »to take matters into her own hands»,\r\nto the detriment of the harmony in the Union. If results in that way\r\ncould be gained, negotiative operations might win more confidence from\r\ndistrustful Norwegian politicians. The Swedish government seems also to\r\nhave taken into account the contingency that, by making this offer, they\r\nwould get Norway to meet them half way, and agree sooner or later to a\r\ndefinite solution of the Union conflict, by a reorganisation, on the\r\ngrounds of having a joint Minister for Foreign affairs.\r\n\r\nIn one respect, it was undeniably a good opportunity for such an attempt.\r\nThe violent Russianizing of Finland, and the undefined plots it\r\nconcealed, could not fail to open the eyes of many in Norway. Even\r\nNorwegian Radicals were obliged to acknowledge that the integrity of the\r\nKingdoms of Scandinavia formed a necessary guarantee for their freedom\r\nand independence[19:1]. It was certainly on that account that their\r\ncourage was not so fully shared by all, when the Norwegian Radicals\r\nprepared to renew their old efforts to break the Union. An honourable\r\ncompromise with Sweden, on that occasion, would probably have been\r\nacceptable.\r\n\r\nBut Mr LAGERHEIM'S experiment had, on all hands, almost insurmountable\r\ndifficulties through which to pilot its way.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The difficulties attending the satisfactory settlement of the\r\nConsular Question._]\r\n\r\nIn Sweden it had always been feared that separate Consuls for Norway\r\nwithout the reorganization of the Foreign administration, would act as a\r\nwedge to rupture the Union, especially as leading Norwegian politicians\r\ntook no pains to hide their ulterior motives. Therefore, the Swedish Diet\r\nin 1893 expressed a decided wish that the Consular question should not be\r\ndiscussed except in connection with the question of Foreign\r\nadministration, and from this decision the Swedish Diet has not since\r\ndeviated in any way.\r\n\r\nIn order, therefore, that there might be some prospect of the Swedish\r\ngovernment gaining the approval of the Swedish Diet, of the result of the\r\nnegotiations, it was necessary that it contained safe guarantees that the\r\nConsular reform would not react to the advantage of a Union programme to\r\nwhich Sweden could never agree: i. e. a purely personal Union.\r\n\r\nBut on the other hand, it was expected that the efforts to get these\r\nguarantees fixed on a firm basis would meet with opposition from the\r\nNorwegian side. The old Norwegian traditions of the Radical party were as\r\ndeeply rooted as ever in the political life of Norway. It was hard for\r\nthe Norwegian Radicals to lose sight of the original political aims in\r\ncarrying out the reform of the Consular service. D:r IBSEN'S aforesaid\r\ninquiry plainly hinted that Norwegian opposition would be raised against\r\nthe Swedish Minister for Foreign affairs having direct control over the\r\nNorwegian Consuls, a stipulation that was absolutely necessary both from\r\na Swedish and a Union point of view. And Norwegian policy had generally\r\nwith its sickly distrust and susceptibility an instinctive disinclination\r\nto bind Norway to anything referring to the burning question of the day.\r\n»As to one's rights, no one negotiates». This has become well nigh the\r\naxiom for Norwegian politics. And Norway now considers she has a right to\r\none and all of her demands.--\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Consular Committee of 1902._]\r\n\r\nIn a joint Cabinet Council held on January 21et 1902, it was resolved to\r\nconvene a Union Consular Committee consisting of two Swedish and two\r\nNorwegian authorities,[21:1] who were to institute an examination as to\r\nhow far a new arrangement with separate Consuls for each of the United\r\nKingdoms would practically work under the administration of the present\r\njoint diplomatic representatives.\r\n\r\nThe Committee accepted its task in a purely administrative spirit. It\r\ndeclared distinctly that it considered it was not compulsory for them to\r\ngive an opinion as to the suitability or desirability[21:2] of the\r\narrangement, or of the political importance that might be assigned to the\r\nsame. This limitation of the duty of the Committee is of importance in\r\norder to understand the terms of its conclusions; it was meant simply to\r\ndescribe the effect of the aforesaid arrangement under certain\r\ncircumstances and nothing more.\r\n\r\nThe Committee gave two alternatives; Norway should either have its own\r\nconsuls, subordinate, to a certain extent, to the Minister of Foreign\r\naffairs, or a separate Consular Service, in which case, the consuls would\r\nbe entirely under Norwegian authority. As to the first of these\r\nalternatives, the Norwegian members explain, that whichever way we look\r\nat the arrangement, it would be at the outset in conflict with the spirit\r\nof the Norwegian Constitution; a corps acting for the most part under\r\nauthority out of Norway, would, from an administrative point of view, be\r\nan »anomaly». The Swedish members evidently ought not to confute the\r\nNorwegian interpretation of the Constitution; they do not approve of it,\r\nnor do they agree to it, though they declare that they see plainly the\r\nadvantages to be obtained, from an disciplinary point of view, by\r\ncontinuing to allow the separate consuls to act under the administration\r\nof the Minister for Foreign affairs.\r\n\r\nThe formal way in which the Committee acted naturally brought about very\r\nimperfect results. The logical consequences of the issue being, for\r\ninstance, that the Minister for Foreign affairs was debarred from giving\r\ninstructions directly to the different consuls; his 'wishes' were first\r\nto be communicated to the Norwegian Consular administration, on whom\r\nrested the decision as to whether or not, the wishes of the Minister of\r\nForeign affairs should be complied with(!). And the Minister of Foreign\r\naffairs, would not, of course, have any power to interfere disciplinary\r\nwhen a consul compromised the relations of the United Kingdoms with\r\nForeign powers etc. etc. The Swedish members express their extreme doubts\r\non the critical points all through, and point out the necessity of an\r\nextremely amicable co-operation between the Minister for Foreign affairs\r\nand the Norwegian Consular Service, as the only guarantee against the\r\ntotal disorganization of the administration for Foreign affairs; the\r\nNorwegians tried to soothe their doubts by declaring that the Norwegian\r\nConsular Service would »duly value the importance of a loyal\r\nco-operation.»\r\n\r\nIt was evident that these statements from the Swedish side could not be\r\nconsidered as contributing to the solution of the problem, so much the\r\nmore so, as the Swedish members had strong doubts. Neither could any\r\nreference to them be made on Norway's part without further notice, the\r\nCommittee itself having shirked the most salient points, namely those of\r\na practical and political nature. And yet in Norway the committee's\r\nconclusions were considered to be an acknowledged method from the Swedish\r\nside for the solution of the question[22:1].\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Negotiations 1902-1903 between Swedish and Norwegian\r\ndelegates._]\r\n\r\nMr. BOSTRÖM became Prime Minister in the summer of 1902, and in the\r\nautumn of that year, negotiations on the Consular question were commenced\r\nbetween the delegates of the Swedish and Norwegian Cabinets. The\r\nconclusions of the Consular Committee were then preliminarily examined\r\nand discussed. In February and March the negotiations were continued in\r\nChristiania, and touched especially upon the political side of the\r\nmatter, particularly the nature and binding power of an eventual\r\nagreement. In the middle of March negotiations were abruptly broken off\r\non the grounds of divergencies of opinion, but were resumed again by the\r\nNorwegian side, the result being published on March 24th in the well\r\nknown so-called Communiqué[23:1].\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Communiqué._]\r\n\r\nThis much-dismissed Act must be regarded as a summary compendium of the\r\npreliminary results of the negotiations in the Consular question, though\r\nit must be especially observed that it is not issued by the governments\r\nthemselves[23:2], but only by different members in each, and that the\r\nSwedish members, at any rate, had no official authority in the matter.\r\n\r\nIts contents inform us that the Swedish negotiators prefer to have the\r\nConsular question solved in conjunction with the entire question of\r\nForeign administration, in other words, _they plainly offered a general\r\nagreement to separate Consular services under a joint Minister of Foreign\r\naffairs_, but that the Norwegian negotiators _refused_ this offer. On the\r\nNorwegian Radical Side it was considered that the time was not yet ripe\r\nfor such a solution, and a resolution in the Storthing affirmed this in\r\nJanuary 1903, with the consent of the government; the Radicals were\r\nevidently determined not to give up their claim--so unreasonable from a\r\nUnion point of view--to a separate Minister for Foreign affairs.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the Consular Question, the Swedish negotiators declare\r\nthat a dissolution of the joint Consular Office, appears to them, in\r\nitself, undesirable, but as an opposite opinion has long been prevalent\r\nin Norway, and as during the preliminary negotiations, it was shown to be\r\n»not impossible» that under certain circumstances a system with different\r\nConsuls for each Kingdom could be established, in order to obtain the\r\nmost important advantage of the political agreement between the two\r\ncountries, they have found it expedient to advise a settlement of the\r\nquestion on the following basis:\r\n\r\n1. Separate Consular Services for Sweden and for Norway shall be\r\nestablished. The Consuls of each kingdom shall be subordinate to the\r\nauthority of their own country which the latter shall have to determine.\r\n\r\n2. The relations of the separate Consuls to the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs and to the Embassies shall be regulated by laws of the same\r\nwording which cannot be altered nor abolished without the consent of the\r\nauthorities of both Kingdoms.\r\n\r\nIt is furthermore stipulated that the Status quo with reference to the\r\nposition of the Minister for Foreign affairs and the Ambassadors should\r\nremain intact. Each Kingdom is to have its right to decide on the\r\nestablishment of its own Consular service; the identical laws are only to\r\nregulate the relations between the Consuls on the one side, and the\r\nMinister for Foreign affairs and diplomatic representatives on the other.\r\nThe laws are especially designed to give a guarantee that the consuls do\r\nnot outstep the boundaries of their occupation and at the same time\r\nsecure the necessary cooperation between the Foreign Administration and\r\nthe Consular Services of the two Kingdoms[24:1].\r\n\r\nWhen the Communiqué was issued, it was received with very great diversity\r\nof feelings on both sides of the State boundaries. The lively discussions\r\nwhich immediately sprung up concerning the actual contents of the\r\nagreement, on which considerable divergence of opinion was held,\r\ncontributed in no small degree to the former. The debates were especially\r\nconcentrated on the contents of what was called the identical laws, and\r\nas the different conceptions on this subject were without doubt of great\r\nimportance in the final issue of the negotiations, it is as well to give\r\nsome enlightenment on the point.\r\n\r\nIn the first part of the Communiqué, which decribes the offer of the\r\nSwedish negotiators, it is mentioned, as aforesaid, that the relations of\r\nthe Separate Consuls to the Minister for Foreign affairs and Diplomatic\r\nrepresentatives should be regulated by identical laws, which could not be\r\n_altered_ or _abolished_ without the consent of the Government powers of\r\nboth Kingdoms. In the mutual resolution reference is made to laws »which\r\ncannot be altered by one of the parties», the word 'abolish' does not\r\noccur. This already caused astonishment. It was asked if this omission\r\nhad any important significance. It was observed that Mr BOSTRÖM, in the\r\nSwedish Diet, made use of the first form of expression, Mr BLEHR in the\r\nNorwegian Diet of the second.[25:1] In reality, the difference depended\r\non some oversight in the final revision which was made in Christiania\r\nunder great excitement in political circles there; this seems to have\r\ngiven a prominent place to the preliminary solution, before the full\r\ncontents were grasped. Mr HAGERUP acknowledged later that the expressions\r\nin reality meant the same, as the conception of the word 'alter', must\r\nnecessarily include the conception of the word 'abolish'. It was\r\nafterwards frequently proposed in debates, that the intended laws should\r\nbe terminable only by mutual agreement, and this question has been\r\nsignificant only through the connection which may be found to exist\r\nbetween it and the chief point of this discussion itself, as to the\r\nextent to which the laws were to be changeable.\r\n\r\nThe divergencies referred especially to the conception of Union Law by\r\nthe Norwegian Radicals, according to which Norway had the right to have\r\nher own Minister for Foreign affairs, and consequently was entitled to\r\nappoint one without agreeing with Sweden. As the proposed laws were\r\nbased upon the presupposition that the Swedish Minister for Foreign\r\naffairs would continue the administration of the Foreign affairs of the\r\nUnion, the question now arose as to whether a Norwegian Minister of\r\nForeign affairs could be appointed unless Sweden consented to the\r\nsuspension of the Consular Laws, or whether the Consular Laws would\r\nbecome extinct of themselves, if Norway made use of her assumed rights in\r\nthe matter.\r\n\r\nIn other words, was it the intention of the Communiqué to force Norway to\r\na solution of the question of the foreign administration only through\r\nnegotiations with Sweden, or had the Norwegian Radicals the liberty to\r\ncontinue to urge Norway to take matters into her own hands?\r\n\r\nIn Norway much anxiety was expressed lest the negotiations should prove\r\ntoo binding,--Norwegian politicians hate, as previously mentioned, to\r\nbe bound in any way--His Excellency BLEHR meanwhile imagined that he\r\nmight be able to explain in the Storthing, in May 1903, that _the laws\r\nwill not include any restrictions for either of the two Kingdoms, in the\r\nmatter of their authority, in future, to decide on questions relating to\r\nthe regulation of foreign administration_; or be reckoned as a proof that\r\nthey had confirmed the existing terms, or bound themselves to carry them\r\nout. This explanation produced a calming effect, and it was confirmed in\r\nthe following debate with satisfaction that the character of these laws\r\ncould not be referred to, as showing, that Norway was bound in any way\r\nwhatever. This interpretation was afterwards approved of by Mr HAGERUP,\r\nand may be said to form the Norwegian official standpoint in all\r\nnegotiations.\r\n\r\nNow, was this also the Swedish interpretation of the Communiqué? It is\r\nevident that the Swedish standpoint in this respect must be of especial\r\nimportance, considering it plainly referred to a guarantee demanded by\r\nSweden[26:1], touching the nature of which the Swedish interpretation of\r\nthe Communiqué must, of necessity, in an especial degree be one of\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nOn the part of the Swedish government, no opinion on the question has yet\r\nbeen published. Buth it may nevertheless, with great certainty, be\r\nassumed _that the Swedish negotiators for the identical laws really,\r\namong other matters, intended to bind Norway not to take the question of\r\nforeign administration »into her own hands_.» The great fear of such a\r\ncontingency, shown by the Norwegian Radicals, is sufficient proof of\r\nthis, for, as a rule, Norwegian politicians keep themselves pretty well\r\ninformed on matters of negotiation, even when they are of a more\r\nconfidential nature. Also, more or less direct references have been made\r\nby the Norwegian government, that the interpretation of the Communiqué by\r\nthe Swedish government differed from its own[27:1]. This supposition is\r\nvindicated by the political situation throughout. It is plain that to the\r\nSwedish government the compensation demanded for concessions in the\r\nConsular question, was the guarantee that the consequences of having a\r\nNorwegian Consular Service would not pave the way for a Norwegian Foreign\r\nOffice. It was therefore first necessary to demand of Norway implicit\r\nloyalty with reference to the future solving of the Foreign Minister\r\nquestion. The Swedish delegates have therefore evidently tried to exact\r\nfrom Norway, as an expression of implicit loyalty, a contract not to seek\r\nto alter the Status quo with respect to the Foreign administration[27:2],\r\nwithout an agreement with Sweden.\r\n\r\nHow is it possible then, that the Norwegian government in the Storthing\r\ncould interpret the Communiqué as it did?\r\n\r\nAs long as the details in the protocol of negotiations are not known, it\r\nis impossible to make any definite assertions.\r\n\r\nThe Norwegian government may possibly have felt assured that the\r\nCommuniqué did not intend a direct refusal to Norway of its assumed legal\r\nright to its own Minister for Foreign affairs--that demand could\r\nscarcely be expected to emanate from Sweden--and passed over the\r\nSwedish delegates' plain intention to bind Norway to the _execution_ of\r\nthat right. But as this question has manifestly been an object of\r\nprotracted debates, the Norwegian government cannot possibly have\r\nremained in ignorance of the Swedish delegates' intentions with regard to\r\nthe wording of the Communiqué on that point, and the Norwegian\r\ngovernments attitude in the matter, is, to say the least, rather strange,\r\nespecially in the light of the apparently somewhat undiplomatic War\r\nMinister STANG'S open declaration in the Storthing, that according to his\r\nidea of the matter, _the decisions in respect to the identical laws were\r\nscarcely in accordance with Mr_ BLEHR'S _interpretation of the\r\nCommuniqué_.\r\n\r\nNow, however matters may have been in detail, one indisputable fact\r\nremains clear, _that the guarantee the Swedish delegates sought to effect\r\nby means of the identical laws, has been refused on the grounds of the\r\nNorwegian interpretation of the Communiqué_. This must be kept strictly\r\nin view, if any correct idea of the ensuing development of events is to\r\nbe obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[19:1] It is undoubtedly Russia's proceedings in Finland which have\r\nespecially influenced the recent unionist-political views of BJÖRNSON.\r\n\r\n[21:1] The most effective power in the Committee was D:r SIGURD IBSEN,\r\nwho is credited with having drawn up the drafts of the result of the\r\nCommittee's debates. The rest of the members were the Swedish Ambassador\r\nBILDT at the Court of St James, the Consul General AMÉEN in Barcelona,\r\nand the Consul General CHRISTOPHERSEN in Antwerp.\r\n\r\n[21:2] The Swedish members of the Committee indicate, incidentally, that\r\nthey do not consider it to be altogether desirable.\r\n\r\n[22:1] NANSEN evidently looks upon the matter in this light (page 64):\r\n»No change in the Consular regulations was made, and it therefore,\r\nfollows that even the _Swedish Commissioners_ did not think it\r\nincompatible with the terms of the Union, for Norway to have separate\r\nConsuls». And, of course, he mentions, »the _unanimous conclusion_ of the\r\ncommittee of experts from _both_ countries» (p. 72).\r\n\r\n[23:1] N:o 3.\r\n\r\n[23:2] The Swedish members were, the Premier, BOSTRÖM, the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs Mr. LAGERHEIM, and State Secretary HUSBERG. The Norwegian\r\nmembers were, Prime Ministers BLEHR and QVAM, and State Secretaries\r\nKNUDSEN and IBSEN\r\n\r\n[24:1] N:o 3 These latter decisions in the Communiqué, which are\r\nconclusive in explaining the later standpoint taken by the Swedish\r\ngovernment, are, of course, omitted by NANSEN.\r\n\r\n[25:1] The same difference also occurs in the drafts of laws which have\r\nbeen proposed at more recent dates.\r\n\r\n[26:1] It is manifest that it is on the part of Sweden that the idea of\r\nidentical laws has arisen. In Norway they afterwards complained,\r\nespecially the Radicals, of that »Massive instrument.»\r\n\r\n[27:1] In the debate in the Storthing on April 27:th 1904 Mr CARL BERNER\r\nsaid he had heard that Mr BLEHR'S explanation in the Storthing\r\nrespecting; the Communiqué before its publication was made known to the\r\nSwedish government: that the latter, neither previously, nor later on,\r\nhad made any objections to it. To this State Secretary MICHELSEN sharply\r\nreplied, that »Mr BLEHR'S explanation was only the explanation of the\r\nNorwegian government on the subject of the Communiqué.»\r\n\r\n[27:2] Further affirmation is given by Mr IBSEN'S declaration in the\r\nStorthing, that the negotiations fell through in consequence of Mr\r\nBOSTRÖM'S opposition to the request of the Norwegian delegates that in\r\nthe Communiqué it should be mentioned that the identical laws were to be\r\nvalid only »so long as the present system of foreign administration\r\nexisted.» When, finally, the Norwegians consented to omit this condition,\r\nit could only have been their intention that the laws should only be\r\nvalid until by mutual consent they were rescinded. Other explanations in\r\nthe Storthing of the divergencies of opinions on this point are to all\r\nintents unacceptable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The reception of the Communiqué in Sweden and Norway._]\r\n\r\nEven without taking into consideration the indistinctness that was\r\nsupposed to characterise the Communiqué, its general contents roused no\r\nunanimous approbation. In the Swedish Diet in May 1903, during a debate,\r\nserious doubts were rife, and it was emphatically declared that the\r\nConsular Question must be solved simultaneously with the Foreign Minister\r\nQuestion as resolved by the Diet in 1893. The Second Chamber (lower Home)\r\nwas more leniently inclined towards the negotiations, but it nevertheless\r\nreferred to the resolution of 1893.\r\n\r\nNor did it get a promising reception in Norway at first. It was known\r\nthere that one of the chief stipulations of the negotiations had been the\r\ncessation of the agitation for a separate Minister of Foreign affairs.\r\nMeanwhile after the publication of the Communiqué, the Norwegian Radicals\r\nimmediately expressed their opinions at their large meeting by again\r\nsolemnly entering this old claim on their party programme.\r\n\r\nHowever when the agitation for a new election for the Storthing was\r\nstarted later on in the year, there was a strong inclination towards\r\nnegotiating, and even BJÖRNSON, among others, warmly advocated the cause\r\nof the negotiation programme, and that too, in opposition to the Radical\r\nMinister BLEHR, who, though having introduced the negotiations, was\r\nsuspected of being but a lukewarm partisan to the cause. The party for\r\nnegotiation conquered, and was in the majority in the Storthing, though\r\nnot in great numbers. The issue could scarcely be attributed to the\r\nSwedish proposal alone, but also in no slight degree to the miserable,\r\nimpoverished condition to which the country had been brought by the old\r\nRadical government. Mr BLEHR resigned in the autumn 1903, after the\r\nelections. Professor HAGERUP, the leader of the Conservatives, then\r\nbecame Prime Minister at Christiania in companionship with D:r IBSEN as\r\nPrime Minister at Stockholm. The old Radical party retired from the\r\nleadership, but exercised, by its criticising, suspicious attitude, a\r\npowerful influence on the progress of the negotiations, and that too, in\r\nno favourable direction.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Negotiations on the basis of the Communiqué._]\r\n\r\nIn a joint Council held on 11th Dec. 1903, the Cabinets of both Kingdoms\r\nwere commissioned to resume negotiations on the Consular question, on the\r\nbasis of the Communiqué. They were carried on slowly during the Spring\r\n1904, but it was not till May that the first official break in the\r\nproceedings was made by Mr. HAGERUP presenting to the Swedish government\r\nthe Norwegian gouvernment proposal for identical laws.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The problem of the relations of the Minister of Foreign\r\naffairs to the Consular service._]\r\n\r\nIt was clear that the chief point of the question should concern the real\r\nauthority to be exercised by the Minister for Foreign affairs over the\r\nConsuls in diplomatic matters. It must necessarily be the chief interest\r\nof the Swedish government to insure a guarantee for this. It was partly a\r\npurely practical matter, that the Minister for Foreign affairs, who was\r\nresponsible for the relations of both Kingdoms to Foreign powers, should\r\nbe able to exercise an efficient control over all matters in any way\r\nconnected with the Diplomatic service. And it was also necessary to\r\nhinder the Norwegian Consular service, in its progressive development,\r\nfrom acting in the direction of a division of the Foreign administration\r\nwithin the Union.\r\n\r\nThe practical necessity of strict co-operation between the Foreign\r\nService and the Consular Service had previously been acknowledged in\r\nNorway on certain sides. It may thus be of interest to recall the strong\r\nefforts that were made by the Norwegian majority in the latest Union\r\nCommittee, to emphasize the importance of having the consuls under the\r\ndirect control of the Minister for Foreign affairs and Envoys in all\r\nmatters which are likely to assume a diplomatic character. The same\r\nconclusions may also be drawn from the plan of some Norwegians to solve\r\nthe Consular question, by arranging for the separation of the mercantile\r\npart of the joint Consular service, while the diplomatic part remained\r\nintact[30:1].\r\n\r\nBut the problem now presented a somewhat different aspect from the one\r\nit had for the Norwegian Majority of the last Union Committee, for it had\r\npostulated a Union Minister of Foreign affairs. And, undoubtedly, a\r\ndeeper penetration into questions it included, had made clearly manifest\r\nthe impossibility of drawing a distinct line between the diplomatic and\r\nmercantile functions of the Consuls. The question, for instance, now\r\narose, as to whether a Norwegian civil official, in certain cases, would\r\nbe subordinate to a Swedish Minister. In the face of this problem, the\r\nNorwegians on their part lost sight of the real points at issue in a most\r\nremarkable way. In the Consular Committee's deliberations, Norwegian\r\nopinion on the question of subordination, that it would be an »anomaly»,\r\nin conflict with the spirit of the Norwegian Constitution etc. etc. made\r\nit evident that the Swedish claim would come into collision, on the part\r\nof Norway, with the formal respect to which the abstract demand of State\r\nSovereignty, viewed logically, is entitled.\r\n\r\nFrom this conflict, the Swedish government had no duty, nor even the\r\nright to withdraw without protest. Facts are of more importance than mere\r\nforms. The evasive talk of the »spirit» of constitutional law, and the\r\nadministrative anomalies could not be decisive. Many events both in\r\npublic annals and administrative legislature are very illogical, and very\r\ngreat anomalies. The main fact which the Swedish government had to hold\r\nin view, was this, _that the responsibility of the Swedish Minister of\r\nForeign affairs, for the joint Foreign policy of the two Kingdoms, must\r\npresuppose a fully effective administration of the same in all its\r\nbranches_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Norwegian proposal. May 1904._]\r\n\r\nThe Norwegian proposal of the 28th May 1904 showed that the views of the\r\nSwedish governement could not entirely be ignored. According to this\r\nproposal[31:1] the Consular administration in Christiania should\r\nregularly inform the Minister of Foreign affairs of nominations, orders\r\nissued etc., etc. which it would be of importance for him to know.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, when an affair seemed likely to assume a Diplomatic\r\ncharacter and required immediate treatment, the Consul should send the\r\nreport directly to the Minister for Foreign affairs, and the latter,\r\nunder similar conditions, would give direct instructions to the Consul.\r\nAmbassadors were also empowered to give orders to the Consuls, but on no\r\naccount to exceed the instructions given by the Norwegian Authorities.\r\n\r\nThis was undoubtedly something, but manifestly not much. The connection\r\nbetween the Diplomatic Service and the Norwegian Consular administration\r\nwas very unsatisfactorily provided for. There was no guarantee whatever\r\nthat the orders of the Norwegian Consular administration would not come\r\ninto conflict with those of the Minister for Foreign affairs, a\r\ndeficiency so much the more serious as the Act § 1--c allowed the\r\nNorwegian Consular administration rather extensive powers of more or less\r\ndiplomatic significance, for instance, that of giving instructions to\r\nConsuls respecting the regulations of International Law.\r\n\r\nFurthermore it was deficient of any provisions that would entitle the\r\nMinister of Foreign affairs and the Ambassadors to the authority to\r\nsecure a guarantee, by strict control, that the Consuls would not\r\ncompromise the Foreign administration, and, in fact, there was good cause\r\nfor declaring from the Swedish side, »that the proposition includes\r\nscarcely any rules calculated to secure the guarantee referred to in the\r\nCommuniqué, that the Consuls would not exceed the proper limits of their\r\noffice», and _was therefore in that respect not in accordance with the\r\nacknowledged principles of the Communiqué_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Mr Bostrom's Conditions._]\r\n\r\nFrom what has been already stated, it seems that in the Swedish Cabinet\r\nthere were divided opinions. But the Government was unanimous in not\r\naccepting the Norwegian proposal, and even in the summer of 1904 it must\r\nhave been evident to the Norwegian Council, that the Swedish Cabinet cil\r\nwould not in any essentials comply with the Norwegian proposal. But the\r\nquestion was not thoroughly discussed by the Swedish Cabinet in pleno,\r\ntill the autumn.\r\n\r\nDuring the autumn Mr LAGERHEIM resigned on the grounds of difference of\r\nopinion with the Prime Minister, though the real cause of his resignation\r\nwas said to have no direct connection with the Union negotiations. In\r\nNovember His Excellency Mr BOSTRÖM went to Christiania and presented his\r\nconditions, as to which the Swedish Cabinet had declared its approval if\r\nthe Norwegian government would approve of them[33:1]. These conditions\r\nstipulated among other matters, that no orders should be issued from the\r\nConsular Office that would come into conflict with the commands of the\r\nMinister of Foreign affairs; that, if a Consul acted in any way likely to\r\ndisturb the relations between the United Kingdoms and the Foreign Powers,\r\nthe Minister of Foreign affairs could send in an appeal to the King,\r\nrecommending his dismissal; that the Ambassadors, in certain cases,\r\nshould also be empowered to suspend the Consul from his Office[33:2].\r\n\r\nAfter personal consultations in Christiania His Excellency Mr HAGERUP\r\nmade a written statement of his objections.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Mr Hagerups Reply._]\r\n\r\nIn this, and the ensuing interpolations on the Norwegian side, the\r\nNorwegian system of conducting negotiations appears in its typical\r\nmanner. Of real facts and reasons there is not a trace. For instance,\r\nthough the Norwegian majority itself, in the last Union Committee,\r\nemphasized the danger of separating the Consular Service from the\r\nDiplomatic administration, Mr HAGERUP does not make the slightest\r\nacknowledgement that interminable practical difficulties would be the\r\nresults of acceding to the Norwegian proposition. Neither is there a\r\nsingle proposal, which, from a Norwegian point of view, would be\r\nacceptable, to make decisions that might in any possible degree remedy\r\nthe deficiences. On the contrary, Mr HAGERUP mentions that such decisions\r\nwould be calculated to stamp Norway as a dependency, according to\r\ninternational and common law principles, and declared that from a\r\nnational point of view, it indicates a very great retrogression on the\r\npresent arrangement of the Consular Service[34:1]. In this, he forgets\r\nthat Mr BOSTRÖM'S conditions refer to exceptional decisions and do not\r\ntouch the Norwegian Consul's normal position as being a Norwegian civil\r\nOfficial, and he omits to observe that the interference of the Diplomatic\r\nOfficials with Consular affairs, as proposed by Mr BOSTRÖM, would very\r\nseldom occur.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Swedish Government's proposal._]\r\n\r\nIt is, meanwhile, easy to understand that Mr BOSTRÖM'S demand, that the\r\nKing, on the Swedish Minister's representations, should be empowered to\r\ndismiss a Norwegian civil official, would deeply injure the Norwegian\r\nsusceptibilities, and that it was therefore quite possible to be blind to\r\nthe fact that the Swedish Minister was also responsible for Norway's\r\nForeign politics. When therefore His Excellency Mr HAGERUP went to\r\nStockholm for further discussions, all the rest of the Swedish Ministers,\r\nas will be seen, were ready to present a Swedish proposal[34:2] for\r\nidentical laws modified especially to meet the sensitive point.\r\n\r\nThe demand that the Consular Office should not issue orders in conflict\r\nwith those given by the Minister of Foreign affairs, remained, but it\r\nnaturally did not necessarily imply a formal subordination, as the\r\nMinister could not give orders directly to the Consular Office. Further,\r\nthe decision remained, that the Ambassadors could, on especial occasions,\r\nsuspend the Consuls from their office, but this decision need not\r\nnecessarily offend the Norwegian susceptibility, as the Ambassadors,\r\nthough more directly under the influence of the Minister for Foreign\r\naffairs, are nevertheless, according to the Norwegian legal point of\r\nview, not only Swedish Officials, but Officials of the Union[35:1]. On\r\nthe other hand, the form for the interference of the Minister for Foreign\r\naffairs with the Consuls was modified in a way which showed great\r\nconsideration for Norway; thus when a Consul had compromised the United\r\nKingdoms, the Minister of Foreign affairs was to bring the matter before\r\nthe joint or the Ministerial Council, after which it was laid before the\r\nKing for decision at a State Council especially dealing with the affairs\r\nof that State.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Norwegian government's Ultimatum._]\r\n\r\nWhat reply now does the Norwegian government give to these apparently\r\nperfectly fair and moderate demands?[35:2]\r\n\r\nIt declares that it »stands to reason» that the Norwegian Consular Office\r\nwould not issue orders in conflict with those of the Minister for Foreign\r\naffairs, and remarks that it is not very appropriate in a form of law, to\r\npresuppose want of loyalty in a Public Office[35:3]. If the Swedish\r\nproposals had been accepted, the Norwegian Consular service would have\r\nbeen very largely placed under the control of the Foreign Minister, who\r\nis constitutionally a Swedish Minister. It claims for other more\r\nimportant points the unsuitability of a »hierarchal» relation between\r\nSwedish and Norwegian officials, and several times cites the decisions of\r\nthe Consular Committee, the one-sided formal views of which the\r\nNorwegian government itself had abandoned. But when the Norwegian\r\ngovernment intends offering other guarantees of cooperation between the\r\nMinister for Foreign affairs and the Norwegian Consular Office, and that\r\nthe Consuls shall not exceed the limits of their duties, it has only to\r\nrefer to the loyalty of the Norwegian Consular Office, and its interest\r\nin keeping Norway from being compromised abroad, guarantees, which, of\r\ncourse, have their significance, when reliable, but manifestly are not of\r\nthe legislative binding nature intended by the Communiqué. Finally the\r\nNorwegian government declares these and sundry other Swedish conditions\r\nunacceptable, and adds, that »if they should be adhered to further\r\ndiscussion the Swedish draft about would be useless»[36:1]. Really a\r\nformal ultimatum!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Swedish government's reply._]\r\n\r\nBefore the Swedish government replied to the Norwegian government's\r\nUltimatum, the critical attitude of the Consular negotiations became the\r\nsubject of debate in the Lower Chamber of the Swedish Diet, and from the\r\nliberal party's side, a strong appeal was made to the government to try,\r\nif possible, to avoid any interruption of the negotiations. The reply of\r\nthe Swedish Cabinet is dated Jan. 30th 1905[36:2]. Its tone is one af\r\ndecision tempered with undoubted moderation and good-will. The Cabinet\r\nfirmly maintains the real grounds of the disputed claims. It especially\r\nemphasizes the importance of the Minister for Foreign affairs having the\r\npower in exceptional cases to interfere in Consular matters, as the\r\nlimits between the Diplomatic and Consular operations are exceedingly\r\nindistinct and, on both sides, there is a natural tendency to extend\r\noperations into departments that had previously been considered as\r\nbelonging to the other party. The reference, made by the Norwegian\r\nCabinet, to the Consular Committee's resolution that the Norwegian\r\nConsuls should be entirely under the control of Norwegian authority, was\r\nmet by the Norwegian Cabinet's own admissions, that the Minister for\r\nForeign affairs should be authorised to give the separate Consuls\r\ninstructions, and, herewith the claim that, in the Diplomatic branch of\r\naffairs, the Norwegian Consuls should be solely under the control of\r\nNorwegian authority may be considered void. Furthermore it points out the\r\nunsatisfactory attitude of the Norwegian proposal with reference to the\r\nguarantees presupposed by the Communiqué that the Consuls shall not\r\nexceed the proper limits of their duty, and the objection made only on\r\nNorway's side, that the best guarantee would be the control exercised by\r\nthe Norwegian Consular Office, is met on the grounds that a guarantee of\r\nthat kind was not intended in the Communiqué, as it had nothing to do\r\nwith the internal relations between Norwegian Consuls and the Norwegian\r\nConsular Office.\r\n\r\nOn the whole the Swedish Cabinet maintains its claims, but it offers to\r\nmodify them, if they can be proved to be in conflict with the provisions\r\nof the Communiqué. Furthermore the possibility is not excluded, of making\r\non other accounts changes and modifications in the proposed resolutions,\r\nbut their essential items must »be adhered to». The Cabinet does not\r\nconsider itself entitled, in the interests of the Union, unconditionally\r\nto refuse the points designated by the Norwegian Cabinet.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Norwegian government breaks off negotiations._]\r\n\r\nTo this document from the Swedish Cabinet, is immediately despatched the\r\nreply, »that the Norwegian Cabinet finds no grounds for further\r\ncommunication on the matter.»\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[30:1] Thus, their claim for a separate Consular service was worded in\r\nthe Norwegian Moderate party's programme as follows: »Our own Norwegian\r\nConsular Service with the exception of all matters connected with the\r\nrelations between the Consular Service and Diplomatic administration is\r\nhereby declared established».\r\n\r\n[31:1] N:o 4.\r\n\r\n[33:1] N:o 5.\r\n\r\n[33:2] Some other points in Mr BOSTRÖM'S Memorandum were rejected by the\r\nNorwegian side. They ran as follows:\r\n\r\n1:o Before a Consul was nominated, opportunity should be given to the\r\nMinister for Foreign affairs to make such observations as he might think\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n2:o In the Consular Diploma, the King shall be styled King of Sweden and\r\nNorway--not King of Norway and Sweden, as was the case in Norway--as\r\nthese Diplomas are intended for presentation to Foreign powers, and the\r\nKing always makes use of this title abroad Foreign powers.\r\n\r\n3:o As long as the appointment of separate consuls was not approved of by\r\nForeign powers and so long as ambassadors in a Foreign conntry had not\r\nbeen stationed, the joint Consular Service should continue its functions.\r\n--Mr HAGERUP did not refer to these points in his reply partly because\r\nthe difficulties of his agreeing on them with Mr BOSTRÖM were not,\r\naccording to his own account, so very insurmountable.\r\n\r\n[34:1] N:o 6.\r\n\r\n[34:2] N:o 7.\r\n\r\n[35:1] They are mentioned, for instance, in the Act of Union.\r\n\r\n[35:2] It is characteristic that NANSEN in his review of the negotiations\r\n(page 76 and following) does not mention one of the Swedish demands. It\r\ncan, however, be safely referred to all, who are impartial on the\r\nsubject, as to whether its decisions, as NANSEN (page 77) insists, imply\r\nthe subordination of the Norwegian Consular Service to the Swedish\r\nMinister for Foreign affairs on a very extensive scale.\r\n\r\n[35:3] In that case, what numbers of legislative rules and regulations\r\nwould have remained unwritten!\r\n\r\n[36:1] N:o 8.\r\n\r\n[36:2] N:o 9\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Norwegian accusations aganist the Swedish government._]\r\n\r\nThe breaking off of the negotiations caused great depression in Norway,\r\nand even in wide circles in Sweden the issue was deeply deplored.\r\n\r\nNorwegian policy had always been a policy of strong feelings, and now it\r\nmade it an object systematically to work up illwill against Sweden.\r\nStrong expressions were not wanting, and soon the whole of Europe--\r\nthanks to the indefatigable manner in which the Norwegians cultivated the\r\nEuropean Press--resounded with accusations against the Swedish\r\ngovernment, and the entire Swedish nation of unreasonableness, fickleness\r\netc. etc.; it was important now to make good cause for the plans then\r\nalready existing in Norway, plans which had probably been laid years ago.\r\n\r\nNow in what does the truth of their accusations lie?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The responsibility of breaking off the negotiations._]\r\n\r\nThe accusations implied in the mildest form that the attitude of the\r\nSwedish government had caused the break down in the negotiations. To this\r\nit must be first pointed out, that the side which first formulated its\r\ndemands as an ultimatum formally bears the responsibility. Formally,\r\ntherfore, the Norwegian government is unquestionably the responsible\r\nparty, so much the more so, that not even after the Norwegian Ultimatum,\r\ndid the Swedish government maintain its standpoint as being absolutely\r\ninflexible. It must also be observed that the first Norwegian proposition\r\nin May 1904, in fact, propounded the essentials contained in the\r\nUltimatum. It was certainly held to be only the grounds for further\r\nnegotiations, but it was proclaimed afterwards on the Norwegian side,\r\nthat the Norwegian Cabinet had found it possible that divergencies in the\r\nform and contents of the law, would be limited to a very slight number of\r\npoints of minor importance.\r\n\r\nThe formal responsibility for the breaking off of the negotiations may\r\nnow, on the whole, be considered of slight importance. It is interesting\r\nonly on the grounds that it illustrates the Norwegian method of\r\nnegotiating, which all but commences with the ultimatum, for it explains\r\nto a great extent the difficulties of the opposite party in gaining their\r\nlawful rights.\r\n\r\nThe accusations on the Norwegian side, of course, imply, that the Swedish\r\ngovernment, in making unreasonable conditions, had practically caused the\r\nbreaking off of the negotiations, and even wished to bring about that\r\nresult. As regards the former, an impartial examination of the Swedish\r\nfinal proposal is the best refutation. And as regards the latter, it may\r\nassuredly be affirmed, that there was no want of good will, on the part\r\nof Sweden, to come to a good understanding on the point, the last letter\r\non the question written by Sweden is a sufficient proof of this. But the\r\ngovernment could not reasonably be expected to go further in granting\r\nconcessions.\r\n\r\nIt was indisputably clear to the Norwegian government, that they could\r\nnot make greater concessions. During the proceeding of the negotiations\r\nit had become intimately acquainted with the opinions in Norwegian\r\npolitical circles, and it knew that if it went further, it would risk a\r\ndefeat in the Storthing. But with equal right, it behoved the Swedish\r\ngovernment to take into consideration the prospects of getting the\r\nproposal approved of by the Swedish Diet, so much the more so, as the\r\nSwedish government, in respect to this question, occupied a more insecure\r\nposition than the Norwegian. The Norwegian government was supported in\r\nthe Storthing by a majority on the side of the negotiations. The Swedish\r\ngovernment had no support at all. The Diet had certainly not insisted on\r\nthe breaking off of the negotiations, but it firmly maintained its old\r\nstandpoint, that the Consular question should be solved in conjunction\r\nwith the Foreign Minister question. It must therefore be of importance to\r\nthe Swedish government, to have the proposition worded in such a way that\r\nit would remove the doubts of the Diet regarding an isolated solution of\r\nthe Consular question. In the matter of the immutability of the identical\r\nlaws, it had sought an effectual guarantee that the independent Consular\r\noffice would not disloyally--when the time was ripe for it--be\r\nprovided by Norway with its own Minister for Foreign affairs. This\r\nquestion had been shirked by Norway. It was therefore necessary to cling\r\nto other guarantees, in order, if possible, to prevent the Norwegian\r\nConsular Office from drifting away from under the direction of the\r\nMinister for Foreign affairs, and thus, paving the way by degrees to its\r\noriginal goal--the breaking op of the joint administration for Foreign\r\naffairs. It is in this light that his Excellency BOSTRÖM'S demands ought\r\nundoubtedly to be seen.\r\n\r\nIt may in short be said: If during the negotiations the Norwegian\r\ngovernment was bound by Norwegian Union-political traditions, the Swedish\r\ngovernment had the same right to refer to its attachment to Swedish\r\nUnion-political traditions. And, it must be added: That if any of the\r\nSwedish conditions, which the Norwegian government pointed out, were an\r\nexpression for a suspicion of Norway's implicit loyalty in conducting its\r\nown Consular affairs, _it was Norwegian traditional Radical Policy from\r\nthe beginning of 1890 which cast its shadow before it_. And that the old\r\nNorwegian Radical traditions had to be taken into account was prowed by\r\nthe number and length of the discussions in the Storthing, which were\r\ndinned into the ears of the negotiators, during the whole period of the\r\nnegotiations. That even Mr MICHELSEN, one of the parties to the\r\nnegotiations on the Norwegian government side, in a debate at the\r\nStorthing, during the Spring 1904, cast friendly glances on the old\r\nlines, showed plainly how little they had forgotten the old talk of\r\ntaking matters into their own hands.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The question as to whether the Swedish government had broken\r\nthe covenant of the Communiqué._]\r\n\r\nBut the Norwegian accusations were not limited to the negotiators'\r\n(especially Mr BOSTRÖM'S) bringing about the breaking off of the\r\nnegotiations by their unreasonable demands. They went further; it was\r\nloudly proclaimed that the Swedish government had not kept their word,\r\nhad broken their agreement etc. etc., and, when all of a sudden Sweden\r\nbecame identical with the government of Sweden she was pathetically\r\npointed at as untrustworthy etc. etc. The amount of moral indignation\r\ncontained in these Norwegian accusations has plainly been made manifest\r\nby late events. Their object--to throw on Sweden the responsibility of\r\nplans that were designed to be executed in Norway--was too transparent,\r\nbut just on that account they must be explained, in order that the\r\nresponsibility of Sweden for what happened in Norway, may appear in its\r\ntrue light.\r\n\r\nThe most naive accusations of having broken their agreement, are based on\r\nthe supposition that the Swedish government was bound by the Communiqué\r\nto bring the negotiations to a definite conclusion, which means about the\r\nsame as, that Sweden had beforehand promised to accept the Norwegian\r\ndemands which in future would be presented by the Norwegian side. This\r\nsupposition requires no serious reflection, the Communiqué naturally\r\nimplying only a promise _to try_ to come to a conclusion that would be\r\nsatisfactory to both parties. This system of reasoning is, however,\r\ntypical of Norwegian politics all through. It is illustrated in one way\r\nby the Norwegian government's peculiar way of practically commencing\r\nnegotiations with an Ultimatum, and it has been characterised, in a very\r\namusing manner, by professor TRYGGER in a debate in the First Chamber of\r\nthe Swedish Diet, immediately after the publishing of the Communiqué.\r\n»Norwegians», he said, »are very fond of negotiations. I have sat with\r\nthem in the Union Committee, for three years, and they have always taken\r\ngreat pleasure in negotiating with us, so long as we acceded to their\r\ndemands».\r\n\r\nFar more serious is the accusation that the Swedish government had\r\nviolated the grounds of the negotiations by exceeding the terms of the\r\nCommuniqué[41:1]. It has evidently been privately expressed by the\r\nnegotiating party in Norway, during the latter stage of the negotiations,\r\nand it was indirectly referred to by Prime Minister HAGERUP when he\r\nannounced in the Storthing, that the negotiations were broken off. The\r\nSwedish government contradicted it, however, in their last letter, and\r\noffered to modify their proposition if it were proved that it exceeded\r\nthe terms of the Communiqué. But the Norwegian government failed to\r\nproduce the proofs, they preferring to cut off negotiations.\r\n\r\nWhat the Norwegians point out over and over again is the provision of the\r\nCommuniqué that the Consuls of each Kingdom shall be under the authority\r\nof the country to which they belong, which matter the country concerned\r\nshall decide. Against this, it has been mentioned, is opposed the Swedish\r\ngovernment's evident plans to arrange a »hierarchal» relationship between\r\nthe Foreign Minister and the Norwegian Consuls. This decision, in itself,\r\nundoubtedly seems to speak for the Norwegian notion of the affair. But an\r\nhonest method of interpretation tries to see individual particles in the\r\nlight of their relation to the whole matter.\r\n\r\nNow, on the contents of the identical laws, the Communiqué confirms among\r\nother things that they shall »give guarantee that the Consuls do not\r\nexceed the proper limits of their occupation.» What guarantee? The\r\nNorwegian negotiators, who scarcely paid any attention to this provision\r\nin their proposition, are said to have maintained verbally, that the best\r\nguarantee was the control exercised over the Consuls by the Norwegian\r\nConsular Office. But to this the Swedish government may justly object:\r\n»that was not the kind of guarantee intended by the Communiqué, as this\r\nhad nothing to do with the internal relations between the Norwegian\r\nconsuls and the Norwegian Consular service. The guarantee which the\r\nCommuniqué mentions, can refer to nothing but the control to be exercised\r\nby the Foreign Minister and Ambassadors over the Consuls».\r\n\r\nIf this interpretation is acknowledged as correct--and it is difficult\r\nto find any other--it is plain that the presupposition cited by the\r\nNorwegians only referred to _normal_ conditions and that it did not\r\nexclude in exceptional cases--as for instance, when Consular affairs\r\nwere in any way connected with the Diplomatic Office--a hierarchal\r\nrelationship between the Foreign Minister and the Consuls. Conclusive\r\nfor the correctness of this interpretation, as represented by the Swedish\r\ngovernment, _is the approval the Norwegian government itself gave this\r\ninterpretation_ by conceding that the Foreign Minister might give direct\r\norders to the Norwegian Consuls, which, in certain cases, implied a\r\nhierarchal relationship between the Foreign Minister and the Norwegian\r\nConsuls. This admission on the Norwegian side must not be regarded as a\r\nconcession _beyond_ the demands of the Communiqué. It had already been\r\nmade before the Communiqué was compiled, and must therefore absolutely be\r\nincluded in the frame of the Communiqué. The so much-disputed claims of\r\nSweden imply nothing but an extension of the above hierarchal exceptional\r\nconditions, especially in an disciplinary sense, and are therefore within\r\nthe frame of the Communiqué.\r\n\r\nIn close connection with the Norwegian accusations against Sweden for\r\nbreach of faith, are the Norwegian governments insinuations that the\r\nSwedish government, by its later shaped demands, had strayed from the\r\nagreement which had previously been decided on, both by the Swedish and\r\nNorwegian sides. The Norwegian government especially refers to the\r\npreliminary agreements, which, under necessary reservations, had been\r\nmade in the negotiations between the delegates of the two Cabinets,\r\nbefore the Communiqué existed.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that these accusations especially touched matters in the\r\nnegotiations, of which outsiders cannot, of course, form a quite distinct\r\nopinion. Meanwhile it would not be impossible to gain an idea of the\r\nbreadth of the case on the grounds of the statements of the Cabinets, the\r\nreferences in the papers, and the debates in the Swedish Diet and the\r\nNorwegian Storthing.\r\n\r\nThe matter that first demands our attention is the communication of the\r\nSwedish Cabinet dated Jan. 30:th 1905, in which it is distinctly declared\r\nthat, when the Norwegian Cabinet had assumed that its proposition of the\r\n28:th May 1904 would, without any alteration worth mentioning, be\r\naccepted by the Swedish Cabinet »it would find no support from\r\nadmissions either of the Swedish Cabinet or its delegates.» Now, there\r\nwere hardly any negotiations between the governments concerning the\r\ncontents of the Consular laws till the time when the first definite\r\nNorwegian proposition was presented. The agreements which the Norwegian\r\nCabinet considers would more nearly refer to the negotiations before the\r\norigin of the Communiqué, to the feigned conclusions of which the\r\nNorwegian government tried to attach the greatest importance. What was\r\nthe character of these negotiations in relation to the contents of the\r\nproposed laws? They were in reality free discussions, during which the\r\ncontents of the deliberations of the Consular Committee were inquired\r\ninto. They were regarded by the negotiators themselves as a\r\n»preliminary», as the first preparatory step to negotiations, and that\r\nthe results of many points were indistinct, is evident, as the Swedish\r\nCabinet gave to understand that, on one or two occasions before the\r\norigin of the Communiqué, fresh negotiations were proposed, but in vain.\r\nThe preliminary act of agreement to which the Norwegian Council referred,\r\nseems to have involved one or two particular points to which they firmly\r\nadhered, especially the one concerning the power of the Foreign Minister\r\nto give direct orders to the Consuls: in all the rest, they confined\r\nthemselves to a general impression that there was a prospect of their\r\nagreeing. According to the authenticated assertion of the Swedish Cabinet\r\nwith respect to the protocol, the materially new claims as the Norwegian\r\nCabinet styled them, had been touched upon in their debates, though not\r\neven a preliminary agreement had been decided on, either with respect to\r\nthem or any of the other points of the question. It is a generally\r\nunderstood fact, not even disputed on the Norwegian side, that his\r\nExcellency BOSTRÖM brought forward casually several of the questions\r\nwhich afterwards raised so many disputes, and reserved to himself the\r\nright, later on, to shape his opinion on points to which be made\r\nobjections. After first dealing with the deliberations of the Consular\r\nCommittee, they proceeded to debate on the terms of the agreement, and\r\nduring this last stage of the negotiations the contents of the intended\r\nlaws were discussed only by special delegates from the two\r\nCabinets[45:1].\r\n\r\nMr LAGERHEIM was uncontradicted by the Norwegian side when he explained\r\nin the Swedish Diet that in all these preliminary negotiations respecting\r\nthe contents of the laws, matters concerning them, »must be subjected to\r\nfurther examination of a very minute and exhaustive nature».\r\n\r\nAccording to just reasoning, it is therefore rather audacious of the\r\nNorwegian side to cite these preliminary negotiations, to which they also\r\nadd a decided admission on the part of Sweden, and on which they build\r\nthe accusations against the Swedish government, and especially Mr BOSTRÖM\r\nof breach of agreement[45:2].\r\n\r\nWith reference to the connection of these negotiations with the\r\nCommuniqué and its interpretation, it is firstly clear that neither the\r\nSwedish nor the Norwegian government had from the first intended by the\r\nCommuniqué to cut off the possibility of pursuing, from different\r\nquarters, the points on which they had not expressed themselves to be in\r\nunity. And secondly, it is plain that by the same Communiqué it was not\r\nintended to cut off the possibility of advancing claims which during\r\nthese very formless negotiations had not been brought forward, so long as\r\nthe general decisions of the Communiqué, sensibly interpreted, were\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\nTo this may be added one important circumstance. It is manifest that if\r\nit was considered necessary to come to some definite conclusion before\r\nthe existence of the Communiqué, it was on account of the binding nature\r\nof the final agreement. It is evident that the Swedish government has\r\nendeavoured to secure the surest guarantee from a Swedish point of view,\r\nthat Norway, of her own accord, would make no changes in respect to the\r\nForeign Administration. Now the negotiation on the vital contents of the\r\nlaws, were _succeeded_ by this, and there is strong reason to suppose\r\nthat the Swedish negotiators expressed their hopes of an eventual\r\ntermination of the negotiations with respect to the detailed decisions of\r\nthe laws, _under the express supposition_ that safe guarantee would be\r\ngranted by the Norwegians, against a one-sided disturbance of the Status\r\nquo in reference to the Foreign Minister. As meanwhile, through the\r\ninterpretation which the Norwegian side chose to give the Communiqué,\r\nthese--to Sweden--very desirable guarantees became an illusion, it\r\nmay very reasonably be asked if the Norwegian side was entitled to exact\r\ntoo much from the Swedish delegate's possible optimism respecting the\r\nprospects of coming to a definite conclusion on the rest of the points.\r\n\r\nFurther demonstrations for the manifestation of the baseless grounds of\r\nthe moral indignation which was eventually to give the Norwegian\r\nrevolution an essential justification before an enlightened public, are\r\nunnessary. The terrible breach of agreement, on the part of Sweden, which\r\nwas trumpeted all over Europe, on closer examination, vanishes into thin\r\nair.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[41:1] NANSEN (page 76): »The Swedish draft contained a number of demands\r\nquite unacceptable to Norway as they were opposed to the very basis and\r\nobject of the negotiations.»\r\n\r\n[45:1] Different drafts of laws were especially to be discussed in this\r\nway. These outlines are, however, characterised by the ever well informed\r\nNorwegian politician Mr C. BERNER as »quite preliminary».\r\n\r\n[45:2] In an earlier stage of the negotiations, the Norwegian Cabinet\r\nwere evidently not under the impression that the most important of these\r\npreliminary negotiations was brought to a successful conclusion. C.\r\nBERNER says--in the Storthing debate Feb. 13th 1904--he had heard\r\nboth from Norwegian and Swedish negotiators that to frame this laws in a\r\nquite satisfactory manner would be a very difficult thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Norwegian policy after the grounding of the Consular\r\nnegotiations._]\r\n\r\nThe breaking off of the Consular negotiations undoubtedly put Norwegian\r\npoliticians into a very difficult situation. Thanks to the close\r\nconnection between the Union policy and the internal party disputes in\r\nNorway, a popular interest has arisen for Union Politics which in\r\ncomparison with the realities disputed over, may be regarded as\r\nextremely abnormal[47:1]. With the lack of consideration which in\r\ncritical moments distinguishes a similarly excited state on the people's\r\npart, it was to be expected that the issue of the negotiations on the\r\nConsular question would rouse their passions\r\n\r\nIt can hardly be said that Norwegian politics stood the trial in the\r\nsituation. To a Norwegian, that which followed may appear as a powerful\r\nand magnificent achievement. Outsiders can content themselves by stating\r\nthat _the high-flown Radical politics of the last 20 years now bear their\r\nfruit_.\r\n\r\nIn these days much is said of »necessity» in the development of events.\r\n»Necessity», it is said, »has been stronger than the wishes of\r\nindividuals». To those who in any degree believe in personal influence\r\nand personal responsibility, and not only the _needs_ in the progress of\r\nhistory, it may be of interest to observe how those who now advance to\r\nthe front in Norway--MICHELSEN, LÖVLAND, BERNER, ARCTANDER--belong to\r\nthe old ranks of radicals from the beginning of 1890. Scarcely any\r\nleading men have more strongly emphasized the importance of _creating_\r\npublic opinion than the Norwegian radical leaders, and few, with regard\r\nto this, have better conformed their conduct to their views. The road to\r\ndo so these men pointed out was now followed at an unchecked pace. The\r\nNorwegian radical policy had reached a climax.\r\n\r\nThe following events in Norway point decidedly to an energetic and\r\ndesigning leadership organised from the beginning. It may be left unsaid\r\nhow far back the plans that where brought to light after the foundering\r\nof the Consular question, were in existence. That they had already been\r\ndiscussed long before that period can hardly be doubted. Neither can it\r\nbe doubted that just in reference to these plans, strong efforts had been\r\nset at work on the Norwegian side to get the Consular negotiations broken\r\noff[47:2]. And it is an indisputable fact that those men of action in\r\nNorway had scarcely dared to take the step, if the ever threatening\r\ndanger in the east had not been allayed for a time; the real importance\r\nof the Union to which they had for some years been alive, could be laid\r\nto rest.\r\n\r\nThat the old traditions of the radicals now took the most prominent place\r\nbecame manifest in innumerable ways. One symtom of this, was the\r\nsystematic labour of exciting opinions against Sweden. The orgies of\r\nSwedish hatred and »national persecution», which in Christiania were held\r\nin the Spring of 1905, far outstepped the limits of decency which even a\r\nNorwegian ought to feel. The coarsest invectives were flung against the\r\ngovernment and people of Sweden. All Europe rang with accusations of\r\nbreach of agreement, ambitions for the supremacy spread from Christiania.\r\nA few sensible and intelligent Norwegians, who really comprehended that\r\nthe Swedish government's claims had legal grounds, and were not meant as\r\nan insult to Norway, made themselves heard[48:1] in the beginning, but\r\ntheir voices were soon silenced in the tumultuons confusion that reigned.\r\nIn Norway feelings were excited, which more than ever gave Norwegian\r\nopinion a tone of unreasonableness.\r\n\r\nAnother symptom was the distinctness with which the Union separation\r\nshone as the goal. This was shown in the Cabinet meeting by the very\r\ntactless, but very Norwegian expressions when the break-down of the\r\nnegotiations was officially announced. The old King was pleased to\r\nexpress his hearty wishes, »that the two Kingdoms which could soon\r\ncelebrate the centenary of their Union, would never let any differences\r\nof opinion break their bonds, as it was the safest security for the\r\nindependency, safety and happiness of the Scandinavian country and its\r\ntwo peoples». To this, the Norwegian Cabinet replied that they had taken\r\nthe liberty in all humble submission to dissuade His Majesty from making\r\nthis speech[48:2].\r\n\r\nA third symptom, and the one most significant of the spirit that now\r\ndominated Norwegian politics was the road that they were soon unanimous\r\non taking. One cannot help feeling that it is a punishment for old sins,\r\nthat when Norway has to take a decisive step, and goes from words to\r\nactions, it is not done openly and with honest intent. Norway does not\r\nchoose the straight road, it chooses winding crooked paths, which the\r\npeculiar advocacy of Norwegian politicians long ago staked out. Norway's\r\nbreaking out of the Union is not a manly act committed under a sense of\r\npersonal responsibility, it is a miserable judicial process, in which\r\nNorway, at the same time party to and self made judge in the case,\r\nartfully tries to establish the guilt of their opponents--Sweden and\r\nthe Union King--in order to throw the burden of responsibility on them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The question of resuming negotiations._]\r\n\r\nIn the Cabinet meeting held on Feb. 7:th 1905[49:1] the Swedish Minister\r\nfor Foreign affairs, Count GYLDENSTOLPE, pointed out that the chief cause\r\nof the wrecking of the negotiations was, that the Swedish Minister for\r\nForeign affairs was supposed still to be at the head of the Foreign\r\npolicy of the Union, and he advocated the desirability of resuming\r\nnegotiations on this phase of the Union problem. The Minister for Foreign\r\naffairs only expressed what had in fact been the wish of the Swedish side\r\nall along, and what especially the Swedish negotiators during the first\r\nstage of the negotiations, had urgently insisted on. The opinion that the\r\nbreak down of the Consular negotiations ought to be immediate cause of\r\nthe renewal of negotiations which were also to include the question of\r\nForeign Administration, seemed at first to be regarded with favour from\r\nthe Norwegian side. The majority of the Norwegian government led by Mr\r\nHAGERUP shared this opinion, though with one reservation. Evidently under\r\nthe influence of the general feelings in Norway, Mr HAGERUP considered\r\nthat if fresh negotiations respecting a revision of the Act of Union led\r\nto no results, the old state of things could not possibly be allowed to\r\ncontinue, but by voluntary agreements they must instead try to obtain\r\n»more independent bases for the Co-operation of the two Nations», in\r\nother words, prepare for the disssolution of the Union. In this way, said\r\nhe, it will be possible to establish a peaceful and honorable Union\r\nTreaty. This was the programme he proposed in the Storting when he\r\nannounced the termination of the negotiations, and he further developed\r\nit when he resigned in March.\r\n\r\nA policy on those lines would at least have been open and honest, and\r\neven if the results had brought about the rupture of the Union, it would\r\nnot have roused strong ill-will; it would, in fact, have preserved the\r\npossibility of establishing conditions of Co-operation on more\r\nindependent lines. Though Sweden which, in the eyes of all Europe, was\r\nresponsible for the Union, could never take the _initiative_ in the\r\nmatter of dissolving the Union, a Norwegian proposal in the terms\r\npresented by Mr HAGERUP had certainly not been refused without further\r\nconsideration[50:1].\r\n\r\nBut it soon appeared that Mr HAGERUP'S programme was not likely to be\r\nfavourably received in Norway. Immediately after the announcement of the\r\ntermination of the negotiations, the Storthing had summoned a so called\r\nSpecial Committee to examine the conditions of the Union. The members of\r\nthis Committee soon went against the majority of the government, and\r\ntherefore, when the State Secretaries MICHELSEN and SCHÖNING at the end\r\nof February protested against Mr HAGERUP'S proceeding, in sending in his\r\nresignation, a complete crisis within the Cabinet was reached.\r\n\r\nThe king had, meanwhile, immediately after the termination of the\r\nnegotiations, resigned the government to the Crown Prince in the capacity\r\nof Regent. After the Crown Prince Regent had conferred with the leading\r\npoliticians in Christiania, he made known his personal opinion on the\r\nmatter in a document adressed to the President of the Special Committee\r\nappointed by the Storthing[50:2] He earnestly expresses his conviction\r\nthat the strength and prosperity of the two Kingdoms lies in the\r\npreservation of the Union. He emphatically declared that the Union was\r\nnot the chief object for the _dynasty_, but it ought to be so to _the two\r\npeoples_ concerned. He expressed warnings against the dissolution of the\r\nUnion, and urged that fresh negotiations, on a broader basis, should be\r\nentered into for the settlement of all matters concerning the Union.\r\n\r\nThe persuasive tone of this document could not fail to make an effect,\r\nbut the Norwegian press tried hard to explain away the contents by\r\ninforming the public of their wonderful discovery, that the document was\r\nof no »Constitutional importance», and shrewdly trying to prove that the\r\nCrown Prince had no legal right to make known his opinion in that\r\nmanner[51:1].\r\n\r\nThose who now held the reins in Norway, had to carry out their plans\r\nbefore the worked up excitement cooled down. Therfore the way of the\r\nnegotiations was so dangerous. The Crown Prince found it necessary to\r\nconsent to a change of Ministry. Mr MICHELSEN, who was pointed out as the\r\nman equal to the situation, was summoned, also a so called mixed Cabinet\r\nconsisting of Ministers of different parties; the two Prime Ministers,\r\nhowever, Mr MICHELSEN und Mr LÖVLAND, were rank radicals. In the\r\nbeginning of March the Special Committee appointed by the Storthing were\r\nable preliminarily to communicate the plan to be followed; it was not a\r\nnovel one, it was the old method from the beginning of the nineties to\r\ntake matters, especially those relating to the Consular service, into\r\n»their own hands».\r\n\r\nIn the middle of March the Crown Prince returned to Stockholm, and here\r\ntwelve members of the Diet were immediately summoned, according to\r\ndecrees in the government regulations, in order to confer with the Crown\r\nPrince Regent on the matter.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th April the Crown Prince, as Regent, dictated a proposal in the\r\njoint Cabinet[51:2] that the two governments should immediately open\r\nnegotiations in view of the settlement of all matters concerning the\r\nUnion on the basis of the programme for a mutual Minister for Foreign\r\naffairs and separate Consular services. He, at the same time, declared\r\nhimself willing to accept other proposals for the settlement of the\r\nmatter so long as the joint control of Foreign affairs was allowed to\r\nremain undisturbed, as that was an indispensable guarantee for the\r\ncontinuance of the Union[52:1].\r\n\r\nOn the publication of the Crown Prince-Regent's proposal, the Prime\r\nMinister BOSTRÖM, against whom the wrath of the Norwegians had especially\r\nbeen directed, resigned his office, which was immediately placed in the\r\nhands of State Secretary RAMSTEDT. The Crown Prince's proposal was\r\nimmediately unanimously adopted on motions from the leading men in both\r\nChambers of the Diet[52:2].\r\n\r\n_In this we thus find a clear and unevasive offer from Sweden to Norway,\r\nfor the establisment of full equality within the Union, and that too in\r\nterms to which Sweden would never have consented but a few years\r\nback_[52:3].\r\n\r\nBut the course of Norwegian politics could not be obstructed. The goal\r\nwas already in sight. In a communication from the Norwegian government of\r\nthe 17th April the reasons for the refusal are set forth. They are\r\ntypically Norwegian. It refers to preceding negotiations, the failure of\r\nwhich is solely accountable to the circumstance that on the part of\r\nSweden it has been found impossible to accede to all the Norwegian\r\ndemands. The termination of the Consular negotiations had especially\r\n»given ground for great disappointment, and if increased by a renewal of\r\nsimilar unfortunate experiments, will threaten the gravest danger to the\r\ngood relations existent between the two peoples». The Norwegian\r\ngovernment knows what means to employ to produce »these good relations»,\r\nnamely, establishing its own Consular Service in the way prognosticated\r\nin the past. This accomplished, »that confidence, which is the mainspring\r\nof every friendly and fruitful inquiry into difficult and delicate\r\nrelations in a Union, will have revived». Norway is thus always the\r\ninjured one, and there is never a thought that Sweden on her part might\r\nhave or possibly _could find_ cause for displeausure over Norwegian Union\r\nPolicy[53:1].\r\n\r\nIn a joint Cabinet in Stockholm on April 23rd the aforementioned\r\nstatements were carried[53:2]. The Swedish Cabinet found it impossible,\r\nfor the present, to resume negotiations. The Norwegian Cabinet stated\r\nimperatively--to those who would believe it--that it is not the\r\nobject of Norwegian action to have the present Union dissolved(!), but\r\nthey were in unity with the Swedish Cabinet. The Crown Prince deeply\r\ndeplored being forced to let these decisions remain final.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of May the Swedish Diet resolved, on the basis of the\r\nabove mentioned motions, to address the King respecting the support they\r\nhad given the Crown Prince's resolution[54:1]. The Diet deeply deplored\r\nthe refusal already given by the Norwegians, but considered it possible\r\nthat their unanimous support of the Crown Prince's programme would lead\r\neventually to more favourable results.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Norwegian agitation._]\r\n\r\nWhile these efforts on the part of the Regent and Sweden were being made\r\nto bring Norway to reason, an energetic and designing agitation was being\r\ncarried on from Christiania. The press went over almost entirely to the\r\nside of the programme; from Trondhjem alone, where union partisanship was\r\nnot altogether inclined to submit to the dictates from Christiania, were\r\nheard hesitations.\r\n\r\nStrong efforts were made in the Storthing to win over the doubting and\r\nunwilling ones, and they were in the main successful. Then followed a\r\nmost energetic propaganda in order to win European opinion on Norway's\r\nside. The European press was well supplied with materials for forming an\r\nopinion of the situation, and with articles in German and English\r\nnewspapers, it became possible to persuade the doubting ones at home,\r\nthat Norway's cause was a righteous one,--all Europe saw that.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Proposal from the Special Committee of the Storthing._]\r\n\r\nWhen the ground was thus well prepared the Special Committee of the\r\nStorthing presented their proposals.\r\n\r\nThis recommends as before mentioned the old well-known tactics of the\r\nfirst days of the Consular dispute. The modifications which were added\r\nwere only designed to hasten events, so that agitated minds should not\r\nhave time to reflect, and reason in some way be restored. In the\r\nbeginning of the 90's the so-called State subsidy line was followed, that\r\nis, a certain sum of money was voted for the purpose of establishing a\r\nseparate Consular Service within a given time. This measure had meanwhile\r\nshown that a delay would occur which would under present circumstances be\r\nexceedingly inconvenient. Therefore the so-called legal measure was\r\nadopted. The Resolution on the Norwegian Consular Service should be\r\npresented to the King in the form of a law, the advantage in this being\r\nthat according to the Norwegian Constitution, a law shall be laid before\r\nthe King immediately after the resolution passed by the Storthing. But\r\nthere was an obstacle to this: the King's right of veto! On the ground of\r\nthe fundamental law, that if the King refuses his sanction to a bill\r\nthree successive times after it has been passed by the unaltered\r\nresolution of the Storting, it becomes the law of the land without his\r\nassent, the personal wishes of the king with regard to legal matters had\r\nof recent times been to a certain extent respected. Thus so recently as\r\n1900 the law applying to Consular Fees had been refused sanction by the\r\nCrown Prince-Regent against the decision of the Ministry, and the Prime\r\nMinister had countersigned the decision. But now the last vestige of\r\nSovereign power was refused. By a resolution that the law should commence\r\nto act on April 1st 1906 all possibility of the King pronouncing his veto\r\nwas cut off beforehand. The settlement of affairs should immediately be\r\nbrought to a climax.\r\n\r\nThe proposed law made no provisions as to the relations of the Consuls to\r\nthe Minister of Foreign affairs. That matter was to be settled by a\r\nNorwegian State Ordinance, dictated by the Ministry. It is easy to\r\nimagine its intended basis by the Special Committee emphatically\r\ndeclaring it to be their opinion that the Norwegian Cabinet had made too\r\nmany concessions in the last Consular negotiations. To begin with, it was\r\nintimated in the Norwegian papers, that the matter referring to the\r\nConsular Service and Diplomatic Department would be settled by treaty\r\nwith Sweden, a most illusive moderation, considering Norway, as\r\npreviously mentioned[55:1], by fixing the date when the laws would first\r\nbe in force, had alone the power of considering the basis of the possible\r\nagreement. But this intimation was very soon contradicted; Norway would\r\ntake matters entirely into her own hands. And it was openly hinted, that\r\nif the King found that he ought to sanction the law, they would then\r\nproceed further with the question of their own Minister for Foreign\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The revolutionary basis of the proposal._]\r\n\r\nThe tactics in the whole of the procedings are characterised as being\r\nrevolutionary against the Union, its object being by one sided Norwegian\r\nresolutions to dissolve the joint Foreign Administration. And as regards\r\nthe Consular question it has been explained that to withdraw without\r\nconsulting Sweden a part of the Foreign affairs from the Minister of\r\nForeign affairs who was mainly responsible for them, was utterly\r\nunreasonable.\r\n\r\nTo what then did the Storthing invite the King? Simply this, _to take a\r\nrevolutionary step against the Union, to an initiatory dissolution of the\r\nUnion, to a protracted undermining of the foundation of the Union_, far\r\nmore dangerous than severing it at one blow. And the ugly thought in the\r\nbackground was this: If the King did not submit to this, it would be\r\nshouted out all over the world, that the King was faithless to the\r\ninterests of Norway, and had denied Norway's Sovereign rights; then he\r\nshould bear the blame for what would happen, the revolutionary rupture of\r\nthe bonds of Union. But not alone on him would the blame be thrown. The\r\nKing in the first place should be put to the proof. But, if the King said\r\n'No', »it cannot», Mr NANSEN says, »be the result of Norwegian influence,\r\n_but on account of Swedish pressure_»[56:1]. Here we are met by the\r\ndishonourable train of thought that has formed the foundation on which\r\nthe Norwegian Radicals have built the whole of their work for undermining\r\nthe Union, that is, never to acknowledge the true motive--piety towards\r\nthe Union--when the King opposed the one-sided disloyal demands of\r\nNorway, but instead always point to Swedish interests as the ruling\r\nmotive. And nevertheless, it is certain, that no Swedish-Norwegian King\r\nhas kept in view the Union, and _all it implied on all sides_, more\r\nfaithfully than King OSCAR II.\r\n\r\n_They closed all roads by which the King would be able to decide the\r\nConsular Question in a manner acceptable from a Union point of view; by\r\nthis means, they forced the King to exercise his veto--and then they\r\ncast the responsibility of the revolution on him and Sweden._ This is the\r\nbasis of the tactics of the Norwegian Revolution. The characteristicness\r\nof this is sufficiently evident.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The decision in the Storthing._]\r\n\r\nThe debate on the proposal of the Special Committee in the Storthing was\r\nfixed for the day after the National Anniversary, May 17th. National\r\nrevelries were to precede to encourage and excite. In Christiania,\r\nespecially, the day was celebrated in such a manner, that there could be\r\nno doubt as to what was in the wind. NANSEN used big words about Norway,\r\nand big words against Sweden, and in the presence of several thousand\r\npersons, a memorial wreath was laid--as on several previous years--on\r\na Colonel KREBS' grave; during the short strife between Sweden and Norway\r\nin 1814, the man had succeeded in repulsing a Swedish regiment!\r\n\r\nThese imposing preparations were followed by the decision of the\r\nStorthing. It was first proposed to decide unanimously without any\r\ndebate. But there were a few members in the Storthing who ventured to\r\nprotest in words--in actions no one dared to protest.\r\n\r\nWith a frankness evidently embarrassing to all present, Mr HAGERUP\r\npointed out the two only possible alternatives with reference to the\r\ndecision; to retract, or to rupture. The latter alternative he evidently\r\nfound most acceptable, and in Norway's real interest, he warned them as\r\nto what the issue might be. He proposed that the decision with respect to\r\nthese eventualities--which might exceed both the Constitution and the\r\nAct of Union--should be deferred till after the new elections, as the\r\nConstitution with an almost torturing emphasis insists on caution when a\r\nchange in the government system is contemplated. Even the rest of the few\r\nin the minority made known their different views, and among them the\r\nShipowner JÖRGEN KNUDSEN openly confessed that he saw no forcible reasons\r\nfor dissolving the joint Consular Service.\r\n\r\nBut the issue was plain. After Mr HAGERUP'S proposal for an adjournment\r\nwas voted against with a minority of few the Consular law was passed\r\nunanimously.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _King Oscar's position in regard to the Consular law._]\r\n\r\nNothing remained now but to continue. The uncertainty in various quarters\r\nas to how king OSCAR would express himself, simply implied ignorance of\r\nthe political situation in an historical light. No Norwegian acquainted\r\nwith the real facts of the case, could be in doubts as to the King's\r\nreply. Norway herself had dictated it and the innocent distrust of\r\nNANSEN[58:1] and Norwegian newspapers, that the King, as they said,\r\n»would really refuse Norway her right» seemed rather unnatural.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Cabinet meeting. 27th May 1905_]\r\n\r\nOn the 27th May a Cabinet meeting was held at the Royal Palace in\r\nStockholm[58:2]. To the Norwegian Cabinet's appeal for sanction to the\r\nConsular law, the King replied that the present regulations for the joint\r\nConsular service as resolved in a joint Cabinet according to the Act of\r\nthe Union § 5, also under the same conditions, that is to say, by treaty\r\nwith Sweden, must be dissolved, and refused his sanction. The Cabinet\r\nraised the strongest objections to this, and referred to Norway's\r\nloyal(!) endeavours to advance the cause. The King's decree implied a\r\nviolation of Norway's independence and Sovereign right, and would\r\nundoubtedly lead to the dissolution of the Union. The Cabinet thereupon,\r\nsent in their resignations[58:3], which the King, meanwhile, refused to\r\nallow, as he had _at present_ no prospect of forming a new Ministry. Then\r\nensued a discussion between the King and the Ministers. The King\r\nmaintained his right based on the Constitutional law, to exercise his\r\nveto according to his own judgment and maintained the duty of the\r\nMinister of State to countersign his decision. The Cabinet sought, on\r\ntheir side, to defend the interpretation given in later years to the\r\nfundamental law, that it presupposed the right of refusing\r\ncountersignature, but could, as a precedent, for present circumstances,\r\nonly quote the not altogether applicable opinion--after full\r\nconsideration--of the Norwegian Cabinet in 1847[58:4].\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The situation after the 27nd May._]\r\n\r\nNow the situation was as follows: The King had been forced to the\r\nextremity of exercising his undoubted right, according to Constitutional\r\nlaw, to form his decision according to his own judgment. It was\r\nfurthermore the Prime Minister's undoubted duty to countersign his\r\ndecree, the Cabinet, by raising protestations, were released from\r\nconstitutional responsibility for the royal decree according to the rules\r\nof the fundamental law. But the Cabinet maintained another interpretation\r\nof the fundamental law, and sent in their resignations, which the King,\r\nmeanwhile, refused to grant as he could not _for the present_--»now»--\r\nform a new Ministry.\r\n\r\nThis word 'now' in the King's refusal to the Cabinets appeal to resign,\r\nundoubtedly implies a reminder of earlier similar situations in the\r\nbeginning of 1890, when the Ministry--on one or two occasions _Radical_\r\n--had remained in office some time after they had tendered their appeals\r\nto resign, as the King was unable to form a new ministry. It was also\r\nwithout doubt the legislative duty of the Ministry to remain at their\r\npost till the King released them. For, according to the general\r\nconstitutional and administrative ideas of justice, it is the King who\r\nreleases his Ministers; they have no legal right to retire of themselves.\r\n\r\nIt is not Norway's _King_ who has transgressed the law, in spite of all\r\nthe accusations to that effect from Norway's government[59:1]. _The law\r\nwas transgressed on June 6th by the Norwegian Cabinet, when they informed\r\nthe King that they resigned office_[59:2].\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Norwegian Revolution._]\r\n\r\nTheir chief reason for this proceeding they declared to be their\r\ninability to be a party to the King's policy, which according to their\r\nopinion, was not in accordance with the Norwegian Constitution, and\r\ndeclared themselves to be 'free men' entitled to the right to resign\r\noffice[60:1]. King OSCAR immediately sent protestations against this\r\nproceeding on the part of the Ministers, both to the Storthing and the\r\nPremier[60:2]. But before these came to hand, the next act was played\r\nout.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th June the Cabinet informed the Storthing of their\r\nresignation[60:3]. The Storthing forgetful of the very important little\r\nword _now_ categorically recorded the fact that the King had declared\r\nhimself incapable of forming a new government, and came to the conclusion\r\nthat the Constitutional Royal Power was »no longer effectual», on which\r\nthe late Ministers were admonished to take up the reins of government,\r\nwhich, according to Constitutional law, was the King's prerogative alone.\r\nThe King was therefore deposed. But Norwegian logic went boldly further.\r\nKing OSCAR having ceased to act as Norway's King, the declaration\r\nfollowed, that the Union with Sweden was dissolved[60:4]. This was all\r\ncommunicated in an address which the Storthing prayed to be allowed to\r\ndeliver to King OSCAR by a deputation[60:5]. The King of course replied\r\nthat he would not receive any deputation from the revolutionary\r\nStorthing[60:6].\r\n\r\nIt is now these resolutions which are not called revolutionary in Norway.\r\nThey are, on the contrary, perfectly legal[60:7]!\r\n\r\nThe King was dethroned, because, supported by rights given by the\r\nConstitution, he refused to sanction a resolution in conflict with the\r\nprinciples of the Union, to which Norway, according to the first\r\nparagraph of her Constitution, is bound.\r\n\r\nThe Union with Sweden was declared dissolved without reference to Sweden,\r\nor observation of the terms in which the slightest change in the\r\nConstitution and the Act of Union must be carried out[61:1]. And this\r\nlast resolution was carried in spite of the Constitutional prescription\r\nthat changes in the same must not come in strife with the principles of\r\nState law, to which, if ever, the Union with Sweden belongs; as the\r\nfreedom and independence of Norway, according to the first paragraph of\r\nthe Constitution, are inseparably connected with this Union[61:2].\r\n\r\nAs aforementioned, all this is not revolution in Norway. Conceptions of\r\nlaws and rights have long shown themselves in strange lights in that\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Protestations of Sweden and the Union King._]\r\n\r\nOn June 9th Sweden declared her protest against the Norwegian revolution.\r\nIn the Cabinet Council to which the Swedish Chambers were summoned to\r\nmeet in on Extraordinary session[61:3], the Prime Minister strongly\r\nemphasised the fact that the Norwegian Storthing's proceedings had deeply\r\nviolated Sweden's rights.\r\n\r\nThe following day, June 10th, King OSCAR issued his protest in an address\r\nto the Norwegian Storthing[62:1]. In clear and convincing terms the King\r\nmaintains his formal legal right to form his resolution in opposition to\r\nthe Cabinet's opinion. And he, as forcibly, maintains that it was in the\r\ncapacity of the chief representative of the _Union_ that he had\r\nconsidered it his duty to refuse his sanction to the Consular law. As\r\nUnion-King, he emphasizes his right and prerogative, even in opposition\r\nto Norwegian public opinion in general, to maintain the principles of the\r\nUnion, and he finally refers to the decisions of himself and Sweden »if\r\nNorway's attack on the existing Union should lead to its _legal_\r\ndissolution».\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Address of the Storthing 19th June 1905._]\r\n\r\nThe reply to this address of the King was an address[62:2] from the\r\nStorthing on June 19th formally to His Majesty the King, but in reality\r\nto the Swedish nation. In this it is explained that the Norwegian people\r\nentertain no feelings of dislike or ill-will to the Swedish people, and\r\nappeals to the Swedish State powers to promote a peaceful agreement on\r\nboth sides. The Storthing addressed this appeal to the people who by\r\ntheir magnanimity and chivalry had won such a prominent place in the\r\nranks of Nations.\r\n\r\nThe Swedish nation had good cause for thinking that it might have\r\nreceived this compliment _a little sooner_, instead of the overwhelming\r\nmass of infamous accusations which it had formerly had to accept with a\r\ngood grace. And above all, it is their opinion that if Norway had\r\nformerly adjusted its actions in accordance with their present ideas of\r\nthe Swedish nation, the present situation would now have been different\r\nin all respects.\r\n\r\nThe document of the 19:th June contains also one detail, which has since,\r\nstep by step, been forced to the front by the Norwegian agitation, and\r\ntherefore deserves its separate explanation. This said that the Swedish\r\ngovernment on the 25:th April had emphatically refused to resume\r\nnegotiations, with the dissolution of the union as an alternative, in\r\ncase unity on the new forms of the union could not be arrived at, and on\r\nthis account, from Norway's side they have tried to cast the blame on\r\nSweden for the revolution of June 7:th under the pretext that Sweden had\r\nalready refused settlement by negotiation. What are the real conditions?\r\n\r\nIn the Norwegian Government's proposal of the 17:th April negotiations\r\nare firmly _refused_, before the Consular question has been settled.\r\nTherefore Norway has never proposed negotiations respecting the\r\nsituation which followed upon the 27:th May, when the King exercised his\r\nveto against the Consular law. Furthermore, attention must be drawn to\r\nthe Norwegian government's wording of the _presuppositions_ for an\r\neventual negotiation. It should be carried on »_on an entirely free basis\r\nwith full recognition of the Sovereignty of each country without any\r\nreservation or restriction whatever_», and among other matters, it was\r\nstipulated, that, if the negotiations fell through, each Kingdom should\r\nbe able to decide, of its own accord, »the future form of its national\r\nexistence.» Thus the Swedish government was to accept in advance the\r\nNorwegian Radicals legal conception of the Union, driven, to it by the\r\ncontingency that if Norway did not get her will in the matter, she would\r\nbreak out, on her own accord, of the Union. It is manifestly against this\r\n_method_ of negotiating matters, with its legal grounds and its premature\r\nthreat to rupture the Union on Norway's side, that the Swedish Prime\r\nMinister appeals, when he speaks of a presupposition for negotiations on\r\nthe Norwegian side »as incompatible with the Union and the Act of Union.»\r\nThe Prime Minister can never have intended to contest the absurdity, that\r\nthe Union cannot legally be dissolved, so that it was not on that account\r\nthat he refused to negotiate.\r\n\r\nBut the Norwegian Cabinet hastened, craftily, to construe the contents af\r\nthe Prime Minister's speech, by maintaining that there was a possibility\r\nfor dissolving the Union[63:1]. Of all the cunning devices, the object of\r\nwhich has been, on Norway's side, cowardly to cast the blame on Sweden,\r\nthis has been one of the most disgusting, so much the more so as the\r\nmajority of the Storthing itself opposed Mr HAGERUP'S proposal, and this\r\nwas certainly not previous to, nor after the Council of the 25:th April,\r\nwhen it was seriously proposed, that a treaty for the dissolution of the\r\nUnion should be drawn up, in the event of the King exercising his veto;\r\nthe tactics that were adopted on 7:th June were made up a long time\r\nbeforehand.--\r\n\r\nOn the 20:th June the Diet assembled.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[47:1] It must be remembered that in reality Norway had an almost\r\nentirely equal influence in the joint Consular service, as questions\r\nrefering to Consular matters were decided in a joint Cabinet, and a\r\nNorwegian government department conducted the mercantile part of affairs.\r\n\r\n[47:2] It does not follow, however, that at least the majority of the\r\nmembers of the Norwegian government tried to come to an agreement.\r\n\r\n[48:1] A very sensible and intelligent article written by Mr FRITZ\r\nHANSEN, member of the last Union Committee, may especially be brought to\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\n[48:2] N:o 10.\r\n\r\n[49:1] N:o 10.\r\n\r\n[50:1] This is proved by the motion on the Union question brought forward\r\nin the Lower Chamber of the Swedish Parliament. See N:o 14.\r\n\r\n[50:2] N:o 11.\r\n\r\n[51:1] NANSEN does not even mention the document in his book.\r\n\r\n[51:2] N:o 12.\r\n\r\n[52:1] This last alternative was considered to imply proposals for a\r\ncompromise, which had now and then been hinted at, namely, that a\r\nChancellor of the Union should direct all matters concerning Union\r\npolicy, but each of the Kingdoms should have its own Minister for Foreign\r\naffairs, chiefly with Consular affairs under their especial direction.\r\nThe proposal was said to have been brought forward in the first place at\r\nthe meeting of the last Union Committee by one of the Norwegian radical\r\nrepresentatives.\r\n\r\n[52:2] N:o 13 and 14.\r\n\r\n[52:3] NANSEN (page 87) rouses suspicion in every possible way against\r\nthis Swedish offer. He implies that the new offer, made immediately after\r\nthe breaking off of the negotiations, which, of course, was caused by\r\nSwedish perfidy, was not likely to inspire confidence, and especially as\r\nit did not include »the same guarantees we had before». It must\r\nnevertheless be observed that this treaty contained far _greater_\r\nguarantees, partly on account of the unanimous decision of the Diet,\r\npartly on the grounds that the Crown Prince's programme was far easier to\r\ncarry out than the programme of the Communiqué, which implied that the\r\nConsular question would solve itself. NANSEN also mentions that »the last\r\nUnion Committee worked on a similar basis without being able to come to a\r\ndecision, as the Swedish proposals were not acceptable to any section of\r\nthe Norwegian Commissioners». To this it must be observed that this\r\nSwedish offer was more conciliatory towards the Norwegian wishes, than\r\nthe Norwegian majority's proposal had been in the last Union Committee.\r\nWhy therefore could it not be accepted by the Norwegians?\r\n\r\n[53:1] N:o 15.\r\n\r\n[53:2] N:o 16.\r\n\r\n[54:1] N:o 17.\r\n\r\n[55:1] Page 14.\r\n\r\n[56:1] NANSEN (pag. 93).\r\n\r\n[58:1] NANSEN page 93.\r\n\r\n[58:2] There is no protocol of this Cabinet meeting, only a complete\r\nreport, communicated to the government of Christiania by the delegates of\r\nthe Cabinet.\r\n\r\nCompare with N:o 19.\r\n\r\n[58:3] N:o 18.\r\n\r\n[58:4] Compare N:o 27.\r\n\r\n[59:1] N:os 18, 19 and 21.\r\n\r\n[59:2] On the Norwegian side they attach great praise to themselves for\r\nhaving given the King a few day's grace in order to form a new Ministry.\r\nThe Norwegian Cabinet also blame the King (Compare with N:o 21) for not\r\nhaving made use of this truce, and plainly imply hereby, that the King in\r\nfact abdicated of his own accord. The King replied to this by alluding to\r\nthe Cabinets open threats (Compare with N:o 19) that the man who, after\r\nbeing warned by the King, dared to approach the King as adviser, from\r\nthat moment lost his national rights; in other words, however the King\r\nmight act, the Revolution would come.

History--even\r\nthe history of Sweden--records many revolutions, which are said to have\r\nbeen a vital necessity. But a revolution can only be morally defended on\r\nthe grounds of its having been _the extreme means of protecting most\r\nimportant interests_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Swedish »oppression»._]\r\n\r\nIn these days there have been numerous comparisons made between Norway's\r\nbreaking out of the Union, and Sweden's struggle for freedom from Denmark\r\nin the middle ages. Sweden's way of using its power has been stamped as\r\nan intolerable _oppression_. It can scarcely be necessary to give a more\r\npowerful confutation to these very idle fancies, than simply to refer to\r\nthe fact that Norway's »struggle for freedom» has had for its object the\r\nenormously important cause--their own consuls!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Sweden's loyalty in conducting the Foreign policy of the\r\nUnion._]\r\n\r\nThe dominating position of Sweden within the Union has consisted simply\r\nin its administration of Foreign affairs of the Union; _in everything\r\nelse Norway has had an independent right of decision in full equality\r\nwith that of Sweden_. An Norway cannot complain that Sweden has conducted\r\nthe administration of Foreign policy in a manner that has been injurious\r\nto the interests of Norway. This was emphatically conceded during the\r\nhottest days of the Stadtholder conflict in 1861. It is remarkable that\r\nin the present day, when the want to prove an antithesis in Norway, they\r\ncan never produce anything but the episode from the beginning of the\r\nUnion--the well known Bodö affair in 1819-1821--an episode concerning\r\nwhich _Norwegian_ investigations of recent date, have served to place\r\nSwedish Foreign administration in a far better light than what Norwegian\r\ntradition had done. The advantage given to Norway by the Swedish\r\nadministration of Foreign affairs, is the inestimable gift of a 90 years'\r\nuninterrupted peace, which has given the people of Norway an opportunity\r\nof peacefully devoting themselves to the labour of material and\r\nspiritual development. Sweden has furthermore especially tried to insure\r\ninterests so far that, in the direction of Foreign affairs, Norwegian\r\nassistance has been employed as far as the regulations in the\r\norganisation of the same would permit. It has already been mentioned that\r\nNorwegian counsels have used their influence in the council for Foreign\r\naffairs, that Norwegian influence on The Consular system has, for a long\r\ntime, been as near as possible equal to that of Sweden. It may also be\r\nadded, that Norwegians have always been appointed to posts in connection\r\nwith those offices under the Foreign Office. In the Foreign Office itself\r\nNorwegians have always held office: even as Under Secretary of State--\r\nthe next in rank to the Minister for Foreign affairs--a Norwegian has\r\nlately been in office. the posts at the Embassies at Foreign Courts, even\r\nthe most important, have to a great extent been held by Norwegians. Of\r\nthose Consuls sent abroad, by far the greater number are Norwegians.\r\nNorway has herself given the best proof that the Swedish administration\r\nof Foreign affairs has been conscientiously carried out to the interests\r\nof Norway, by, time after time, refusing the Swedish offers to give\r\nNorway greater influence in the settlement of Foreign affairs, offers,\r\nwhich even if they did not accede to all Norway's demands, would, if\r\nrealised, have given Norway a far better position than it had previously\r\nheld.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Has Norway been denied its prerogative._]\r\n\r\nBut it has been said on the Norwegian side--and this has been brought\r\nforward as the main point--Norway has been denied her prerogative, as a\r\n»free and independent Kingdom». If by that, they mean that Norway has\r\nbeen denied equality in the Union, it is _not true_.\r\n\r\nSweden's only condition, that Norway, as they say, should enjoy her\r\nprerogative, has been, that this prerogative in its application should be\r\nsubordinate to the demands stipulated by the Union, demands which Sweden\r\non her side was quite prepared to submit to. That a right should be\r\nmaintained under the consciousness that it has its limits in necessary\r\nobligatory respects, has been almost lost sight of by Norway. The chief\r\nimpetus of the Revolution has been a reckless desire on the part of the\r\nNorwegians to be absolutly their own masters, that and nothing else.\r\nNorway has bragged about her prerogatives without any feeling of\r\nresponsibility, like an unreasoning whimsical child. It must be\r\n_declared_, both on historical and psychological grounds, that it can\r\nnever be politically _defended_. Norway must already have made the\r\ndiscovery that the great era of universal politics, is entitled, if ever,\r\n_to political action under a strict sense of responsibility_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Faults on Sweden's side._]\r\n\r\nBy this it is by no means our intention to deny that Sweden herself is to\r\na certain extent to blame for things going as they have done. Looking\r\nback over the Union Policy of Sweden, it must, in the first place, be\r\nnoticeable that there has been, to a certain extent, a lack of firmness\r\nand authority. And it cannot either be denied that there have been\r\nmistakes that have unnecessarily roused opposition. For instance, in the\r\nso-called Stadtholder question, in the sixties, Sweden's policy was\r\nundoubtedly too harsh. But whatever faults may be laid at the door of the\r\nUnion Policy of Sweden, when the Swedish nation in these days tries to\r\nmake a searching self examination, opinions are not little likely to be\r\nunanimous because Sweden has been _too conciliatory_ towards Norways'\r\ndemands.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Swedish opinion._]\r\n\r\nIt is said that a foreigner recently travelling in the Scandinavian\r\ncountries made the observation that Swedes always spoke kindly of the\r\nNorwegians, and the Norwegians always spoke ill of the Swedes. The\r\nobservation doubtless contains a good deal of truth. It is, at least,\r\ntrue that Swedish public opinion, at large, has been distinguished by\r\nkindliness both to Norway and its people, and that every honest effort to\r\nsmooth discussions has had the sympathy of an overwhelming majority of\r\nthe people of Sweden. Swedes have been very unwilling to listen to the\r\nprophets of evil who have pointed to the deficiencies and deformities of\r\nNorwegian policy, and prognosticated trouble. It is just on that account\r\nthat indignation from one end of Sweden to the other is so much the more\r\nintense when the veil is so rudely torn aside, and Norwegian politics are\r\nshown in their true light, such as they are and--have been. The\r\nrevolutionary act of Norway has like a flash of lightning illuminated the\r\npast background of Norwegian politics, and exhibited to the people of\r\nSweden all the unreasonableness, the craftiness and dishonesty which\r\nSweden has had to put up with from Norway during the past decennials.\r\n\r\nIn this way, the memories of the history of the Union of the latest\r\nperiods are revived with indignation among the people of Sweden. If the\r\nindignation is at times expressed in unnecessarily strong and ill-chosen\r\nterms, Norway has in truth no manner of right to complain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACTS TOUCHING THE SWEDISH-NORWEGIAN CRISIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.\r\n\r\nExtracts from the Constitution of Norway.\r\n\r\n\r\n[-- -- --]\r\n\r\n§ 1.

(The\r\nso-called Communiqué).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe negotiations carried on in Stockholm during the last months of\r\nOctober, December, and January between the members of the Swedish and the\r\nNorwegian Government here subjoined, and regarding the Consular question,\r\nhave been continued in Christiania during February and March.\r\n\r\nDuring these negotiations the Swedish members maintained that the\r\nestablishment of a separate Consular service for each of the United\r\nKingdoms did not seem to them desirable in itself, and that they were not\r\nconvinced that a dissolution of the existing community, in this respect,\r\nwould convey any important practical advantages to either of the\r\nKingdoms. On the contrary, there were reasons to apprehend lest this\r\narrangement should lead to inconveniences.\r\n\r\nWhereas, however, an opposite opinion has long been upheld by Norway and\r\nwhereas, during the negotiations resulting from the report of the latest\r\nConsular committee made up by members from both countries, it has turned\r\nout not to be impossible to arrange, on certain conditions, such a system\r\nwith separate consuls for each Kingdom as could, while it was meant to\r\nsatisfy the desires expressed by Norway, also remove the principal\r\napprehensions on the part of Sweden, the Swedish negotiators in order to\r\nattain the most important advantage of political concord between the two\r\nKingdoms, have found it possible to recommend an agreement on the\r\nfollowing terms:\r\n\r\n1. Separate Consular services for Sweden and for Norway shall be\r\nestablished. The Consuls of each Kingdom shall be subordinate to the\r\nauthority of their own country which the latter shall have to determine.\r\n\r\n2. The relations of the separate consuls to the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs and to the Embassies shall be regulated by laws of th seame\r\nwording which cannot be altered nor abolished without the consent of the\r\nauthorities, of both Kingdoms.\r\n\r\nThe Swedish negotiators have added to this that they realise in full and\r\nacknowledge that the position held for the present by the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs, does not correspond to the equality within the Union\r\nthat Norway is entitled to claim. They have held forth the desirability\r\nof this question being made an object of negotiations, which, however, at\r\npresent has not met with approval on the part of Norway. They have,\r\nhowever, declared themselves prepared to advise the King, whenever such a\r\ndesire is expressed on the side of Norway, to lay before the Riksdag and\r\nthe Storthing a proposition about such alterations of the Act of Union as\r\ncan clear the way for the King to appoint a Swede or a Norwegian-Minister\r\nfor Foreign affairs and render it possible to institute the minister's\r\nconstitutional responsibility before the national assemblies of both\r\nKingdoms.\r\n\r\nTo this the Norwegian negotiators have answered that they naturally\r\nconcur in the opinion that the existing arrangement for the\r\nadministration of Foreign affairs does not agree with Norway's justified\r\nclaims on equality within the Union. It was therefore all the more\r\nevident that, on the part of Norway, no regulations could be accepted\r\nthat were meant to bind it to this arrangement. At the same time,\r\nhowever, they wanted to express the hope that the question about a\r\nsatisfactory arrangement of the administration of Foreign affairs might\r\nsoon be made an object of negotiations between the Kingdoms.\r\n\r\nWhen the present negotiations had been carried on by Norway under the\r\nsupposition that the question about a change of this unsatisfactory state\r\nof things should be left untouched, it had been done so out of regard to\r\nthe fact that the opinions about the best way of correcting this state of\r\nthings were so different in the two countries that, for the present, an\r\nagreement could not be expected.\r\n\r\nWe Swedish and Norwegian negotiators, having thus been confined to try to\r\nbring about such an arrangement of the Consular question as will leave\r\n_status quo_ undisturbed with respect to the position of the Minister for\r\nForeign affairs and of the Embassies, have agreed upon that the relation\r\nbetween the Minister and the Diplomacy on the one hand, and the separate\r\nConsular Services on the other, should be regulated by laws of the same\r\nwording which cannot be altered by one of the parties alone and which\r\nboth shall guarantee that the Consuls do not overstep the limits of their\r\nauthority and at the same time shall add security to the necessary\r\nco-operation between the management of foreign affairs and the Consular\r\nServices of both Kingdoms.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion we also want to express the hope that the time shall not\r\nbe remote when, by conciliatory advances on both sides, the question of\r\narranging the management of Foreign affairs can be made an object of\r\nnegotiations and find such a solution as can produce satisfaction in both\r\ncountries and enduringly secure the futurity of the Union.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[73:1] These enactsments show plainly that the Act of Union only\r\nrecognizes the Swedish Minister for Foreign affairs as the leader of the\r\nForeign Policy of the Union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.\r\n\r\nExtracts from the Norwegian Government's draft of laws of the same\r\nwording in order to regulate the relations between the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs and the legations on the one hand, and the separate\r\nConsular services of the two countries on the other hand.

No approval on the part of Norway can be expected for an arrangement\r\nthat would give Swedish authorities the possibility of interfering with\r\nmeasures taken by a Norwegian authority. Also in this respect we merely\r\nadhere to the Communiqué and the Protocols of December that, as a basis\r\nof agreement, give prominence to the establishment of a separate Consular\r\nservice for Sweden and for Norway, in which case »the Consuls of each\r\nKingdom shall be subordinate to the authority of their own country which\r\nthe latter shall have to determine.» This arrangement does not however\r\npreclude, as is also presupposed in the Norwegian draft, a certain\r\npossibility for the Foreign Minister to address direct requests to the\r\nconsuls.\r\n\r\n[-- -- --]\r\n\r\nWith particular regard to the demand expressed in the »outlines» that the\r\nSwedish Minister for Foreign affairs shall have the right--this is the,\r\nintention according to your Excellency's verbal declaration--to\r\ndischarge in ministerial--consequently in Swedish--Cabinet Council a\r\nconsul appointed in Norwegian Council, I ventured to point out 1) that\r\nthis demand was entirely contrary to the Norwegian Constitution, 2) that\r\nan arrangement by which a Swedish authority of state might nullify a\r\nresolution adopted by a Norwegian authority of state would, according to\r\nthe general principles of political and international law, impress upon\r\nNorway the stamp of a dependency, and 3) that it would therefore from a\r\nnational point of view signify an enormous retrograde step as compared\r\nwith the present arrangement of the Consular service.\r\n\r\n[-- -- --]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7.\r\n\r\nExtracts from the draft of laws of the same wording made by the Swedish\r\nGovernment in December 1904.\r\n\r\n\r\n[-- -- --]\r\n\r\n§ 8.\r\n\r\nIf in a matter being dealt with by the Consular administration, the\r\nMinister for Foreign affairs has informed that he has taken such a\r\nmeasure as is alluded to in § 9, it is for the Consular administration to\r\nobserve that, from its side, no such instructions are given to the consul\r\nconcerned as are conflicting with any reorder relating to this matter\r\ngiven by the Minister for Foreign affairs and known to the Consular\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\n§ 9.\r\n\r\nThe Minister for Foreign affairs has, in a matter belonging to his\r\nprovince, to request immediate information from the Consul of the country\r\nconcerned and also give him instructions about what he has to observe in\r\nsuch a matter; and a consul is absolutely bound to fullfill what is thus\r\nrequested of him.\r\n\r\n[-- -- --]\r\n\r\n§ 11.\r\n\r\nIf the Minister for Foreign Affairs should learn that a Consular employé\r\nhas not acted with good and worthy behaviour towards the authorities of\r\nthe country where he is employed, or that he has participated in\r\npolitical demonstrations, or secretely, or openly encouraged or supported\r\nattacks on the existing Government, or else behaves in a way that may\r\nhave a disturbing effect upon the good relations between the United\r\nKingdoms and the Foreign Power concerned, then the minister has humbly to\r\ngive notice of it to the King in Joint or in Ministerial Cabinet Council\r\nwhereupon the matter is submitted to the King's consideration in the\r\nCabinet Council of the country concerned.\r\n\r\n[-- -- --]\r\n\r\n§ 16.\r\n\r\nIf a legation should find a Consul guilty of a proceeding or a neglect\r\nalluded to in § 11, or if a Consul should be prosecuted for a crime\r\naffecting his civil repute, the legation, if finding it justified by\r\ncircumstances, has to suspend the Consul from his office; and the matter\r\nshould immedately be reported both to the Minister for Foreign affairs\r\nand to the Consular administration concerned.\r\n\r\nA Consul thus suspended from his office, must not again come into office\r\nuntil the King, after hearing the Minister for Foreign affairs, has\r\nresolved upon it.\r\n\r\n[-- -- --]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8.\r\n\r\nExtracts from notes made, in consequence of the Swedish Government's\r\ndraft of laws of the same wording by the Norwegian Cabinet Council, on\r\nJanuary 11, 1905.\r\n\r\n\r\n[-- -- --]\r\n\r\nTo § 8. It is stated here that, when. in a matter being dealt with by the\r\nConsular administration, the Foreign Minister has given a Consul an\r\norder, it is for the Consular administration to observe that, from its\r\nside, no order conflicting with it is given to the Consul. It is\r\ndifficult to understand what is meant by this paragraph, which is without\r\na parallel in the present Consular statutes which do not direct any\r\nsimilar injunction to the Norwegian Consular department. To judge from\r\nreference to § 4, it does not seem to have been intended to give the\r\nForeign Minister the right, in whatever be which matter being dealt with\r\nby the Consular administration, to stop the function of the latter and to\r\nassert his own authority instead; for this would be equivalent to\r\ninstituting a relation of subordination that no Governmental department\r\ncan submit to. The intention, then, can only be supposed to have been\r\nthe following:--to try, in a consular matter, that has assumed a\r\ndiplomatic aspect or that is simultaneously subject to a consular and a\r\ndiplomatic treatment, to prevent the Consular administration from\r\narbitrarily trespassing upon the province of the Foreign Minister. It\r\nstands to reason that this must not occur. But just because it stands to\r\nreason, the precept is superfluous. And what is of more importance: it is\r\ncalculated to excite indignation. For, as it is obvious that an\r\ninterference of the said kind must be a manifestation either of want of\r\njudgment or of disloyalty, it should be admitted that it is not very\r\nappropriate to give in a law, even in an indirect way, an expression to\r\nthe thought that such qualities may prevail in the department concerned.\r\n\r\n[-- -- --]\r\n\r\nTo § 11. [-- --] We should not however dwell upon these formal\r\nconsiderations which are of a merely secondary importance as compared\r\nwith the far-reaching question: exclusively Norwegian or partly joint\r\ntreatment of matters concerning the relations of Norwegian Consuls\r\nwheteher to the Foreign Minister, or to legations, or to Foreign\r\nauthorities. In this connection we want to quote a passage from the\r\nreport of the last Consular Committee made up of members from both\r\ncountries where we read (Norwegian edition, p. 16): »Furthermore the\r\nNorwegian Consular administration has to leave it to the Foreign Minister\r\n(and the legations) to receive and reply to reclamations from Foreign\r\nGovernments in the rare cases when subjects of contention arise by the\r\nactions of Norwegian Consuls. For this kind of correspondence, although\r\ndealing with the behaviour of Consuls, is owing to its nature diplomatic\r\nand not consular, and in as much as the matter has a political moment,\r\nthe Foreign Minister should continue to keep the management of it; if the\r\nmatter should become critical so as to grow into a real international\r\nconflict, he should report it to the King and procure the instructions\r\nnecessary for its treatment. It stands to reason that he should not be\r\ndebarred from influencing the course of the matter by informing the\r\nNorwegian Consular administration of his opinion as to the steps suitable\r\nto take with regard to the consul Concerned. But the very instructions to\r\nthe latter or the disciplinary steps occasioned by the matter belong to\r\nthe home consular management and should therefore be issued from the\r\nNorwegian department.» We concur in the opinion expressed here and the\r\ndemand for an exclusively Norwegian treatment of questions concerning\r\nmeasures against Norwegian Consuls, appears still more justified in the\r\ncases when the matter is without a political moment, but the question\r\nregards the consul's relation to the Foreign Minister and the legations.\r\nIn the last-mentioned respect we want again to refer to the statement of\r\nthe Consular Committee (Norwegian edition, pp. 25-26), from which it is\r\nevident that they did not intend any joint treatment of matters relating\r\nto the Consul's disobedience of instructions or omission of duties; nor\r\nwas this intention expressed during the negotiations that took place\r\nbefore the appearance of the Communiqué. Such a joint treatment that\r\nshould precede the treatment from the Norwegian side, can only imply one\r\nof two things. Either it means to be a mere formality only calculated to\r\ndelay matters perhaps requiring a speedy decision. Or else it means to be\r\na real treatment, in which case, the Foreign Minister is intended to get\r\ninfluence on the settlement of the matter; but in this case it will\r\nsignify an encroachment upon a department which, as it maintained, should\r\nbe exclusively reserved for a Norwegian authority of State. Besides, it\r\nis self-evident that the Consular administration which may justly be\r\nsupposed to be equally interested as the Foreign Minister in Norway not\r\nbeing compromised by her agents abroad, cannot forbear, when demands for\r\na Consul's revocation are made on the part of diplomacy, to make the\r\nmatter the object of a humble report.\r\n\r\n[-- -- --]\r\n\r\nTo § 16. It is proposed here that the legation shall have the right to\r\nsuspend a Consul guilty of such conduct as is spoken of in § 11, or\r\nprosecuted for a crime affecting his civic reputation. In this connection\r\nit should be remembered that, according to the present consular statute,\r\nthe right to suspend a consular official does not lie with the legations,\r\nbut with the Foreign Minister who, after having taken his measures, has\r\nto submit the matter to his Majesty. As to the right to suspend future\r\nNorwegian consular officials, this right, just as is done with regard to\r\nother state officials, shall according to the Constitution be exercised\r\nby the King (see the Constitution, § 22 and Aschehoug, Norges nuværende\r\nstatsforfatning, ii, 474.) To transfer this right upon the legations\r\nwould be incongruous with the Constitution. But not even with regard to\r\nconsular functionaries who are not state officials, and who, during the\r\npresent community in Consular service, are suspended, by the superior\r\nconsul concerned, the right of suspension should be granted to the\r\nlegations. For, the view is held, in accordance with the Consular\r\nCommittee of the joint Kingdoms (see their report, Norwegian edition, pp.\r\n24, 25) that between consular functionaries exclusively subject to\r\nNorwegian authonity and ambassadors exclusively subject to a Swedish\r\nminister, there is no possibility of establishing truly hierarchic\r\nrelations: [-- -- --]\r\n\r\n[-- -- --]\r\n\r\nAfter the considerations made above, it will be obvious that from a\r\nNorwegian point of view, these paragraphs appear as unacceptable, partly\r\nbecause they are incongruous with the Constitution of Norway or with the\r\nclaims that in this country are put upon the contents and the forms of\r\nindependecy, partly because, by this, the aim cannot be gained, that is\r\nintended by the whole negotiation, viz--to use the words of the Swedish\r\nnegotiators--to establish a separate Consular service for Sweden and\r\nfor Norway The Consuls of each Kingdom are subject to the home authority\r\nthat each country decides for itself. (see the Communiqué of March 24,\r\n1903).\r\n\r\nOn this account we recommend to omit from the Swedish draft the\r\nparagraphs 5, 6, 8, 11, 16, and 19. If they should be adhered to, further\r\ndiscussion about the Swedish draft will be futile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9.\r\n\r\nExtracts from the answer of the Swedish Cabinet Council to the memorandum\r\nmade by the Norwegian Cabinet Council on January 11, 1905. Dated January\r\n30, 1905.\r\n\r\n\r\n[-- -- --]\r\n\r\nIn the memorandum of the Norwegian Cabinet Council it is suggested that §\r\n8 of the Swedish draft can be interpreted so as to be meant with regard\r\nto any matter being treated by the Consular administration, to give the\r\nForeign Minister the right to stop the function of the latter and to\r\nassert his own authority instead. But as it is expressly indicated in the\r\ndraft that the precept concerned is meant to be relevant only to a\r\ncertain case specially mentioned, the opinion expressed does not seem to\r\nbe justified. The precept has in view to regulate the relations between\r\nthe Foreign Minister and the Consular administration, if, in a matter\r\nsubject to consular treatment, the Foreign Minister, owing to the\r\norigination of diplomatic or political circumstances, has found reason to\r\ninterfere by virtue of the right the laws are meant to bestow upon him.\r\nWhen thus a matter is simultaneously treated by different authorities,\r\nthat each within its province has to treat it, the possibility of a\r\nconflict can hardly be denied, and still less so as the limits between\r\nthe diplomatic and the consular province, as is generally acknowledged,\r\nare extremely uncertain, and as on both sides there is a natural tendency\r\nto extend the sphere of activity to departments formerly looked upon as\r\nexclusively belonging to the other party. It cannot therefore be\r\nincongruous with the laws now being under discussion to insert\r\nregulations for the case alluded to; on the contrary, it seems to be\r\nentirely in consistency with the basis of these laws and with the end of\r\ntheir institution that such regulations should be given. And it can\r\nhardly be denied that in this case that authority, is the Foreign\r\nMinister, who represents both countries, and in the present case it must\r\nbe considered that attention to the interests most important to the joint\r\ncountries should be preferred.\r\n\r\nThe precepts of §§ 11 and 16 contain the particular instructions meant to\r\nguarrantee that the Consuls shall not transgress the due limits of their\r\nprovince. Such a guarrantee cannot be dispensed with in the opinion of\r\nthe Swedish Cabinet Council. For, cases may be imagined when in a foreign\r\ncountry a Consul behaves in a way threatening to disturb the good\r\nrelations between the Government of the country and the United Kingdoms.\r\nTo deprive the representatives of the United Kingdoms, as to their\r\nrelations to Foreign Powers; i. e. the Foreign Minister and the\r\nlegations, of all possibility of interfering against the Consul under\r\nsuch circumstances would, in the opinion of the Swedish Cabinet Council,\r\nhardly be compatible with the dignity of the United Kingdoms and might,\r\nwith regard to the Foreign Power, involve a danger that should be\r\nescaped. The Norwegian and the Swedish draft alike contain regulations\r\nenjoining upon the Consul the duty of obedience towards the Foreign\r\nMinister and the legation. Also in case the Consul should violate his\r\nduty of obedience, the proper consideration and regard for the position\r\nheld by the Foreign Minister and the legation seem to demand the\r\npossibility for them to interfere. For this interference, however, such a\r\nform has been proposed that the decision of the Consul's conduct, of his\r\nremaining in office or his dismissal would be made by the King in the\r\nCabinet Council of that country represented by the Consul.\r\n\r\nIn support of his standpoint that »a joint treatment of matters\r\nconcerning the Consul's relations whether to the Foreign Minister, or the\r\nlegations or the Foreign Authorities» must not occur, the Norwegian\r\nCabinet Council refers to the contents of the report of the Consular\r\nCommittee and quotes especially a passage terminating in these words.\r\n»But the very instructions to the latter (i. e. the consul) or the\r\ndisciplinary steps that may be occasioned by the matter, belong to the\r\ninternal consular management and must therefore be issued by the\r\nNorwegian department.» To this the objection should be made that the\r\nopinion of the Consular committee is naturally not binding to the Swedish\r\nCabinet Council, and that besides the Norwegian Cabinet Council has\r\nitself given up the same opinion in granting in its draft the Foreign\r\nMinister and the legations, the right to address »injunctions» that the\r\nConsul cannot forbear to pay heed to. This seems to imply a giving-up of\r\nthe claim that, in the diplomatic part of a matter, Norwegian consuls\r\nshall be exclusively subject to Norwegian authorities.\r\n\r\n[-- -- --]\r\n\r\nFrom the detailed statement given it may be gathered that the Swedish\r\nCabinet Council considers itself neither bound nor, out of regard to the\r\nwelfare of the Union, justified to cancel outright, in the way demanded\r\nin the Norwegian memorandum, the abovementioned paragraphs of its draft.\r\nThis does not however imply that from the Swedish side alterations and\r\nmodifications of the precepts proposed cannot be granted, but what is\r\nimportant in them must however be adhered to; and concerning possible\r\nmodifications, which can be exactly stated only by continued\r\nnegotiations, there is at present no occasion for entering into\r\nparticulars.\r\n\r\n[-- -- --]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10.\r\n\r\nRecord of Foreign Office affair, made before H. M. the King in the\r\npresence of H. R. H. the Crown Prince in Joint Cabinet Council at\r\nStockholm Palace, on February 7, 1905.\r\n\r\n\r\nHis Excellency the Minister for Foreign Affairs gave, in all humility, an\r\naccount of a humble report about terminating the negotiations for the\r\nestablishment of a separate Consular service for Sweden and for Norway.\r\nIn answer to the Foreign Minister's recommendation in Joint Swedish and\r\nNorwegian Cabinet Council of the 6th inst., this proposal had been made\r\nby Royal Norwegian Government on the same day, and a copy of it has been\r\nappended to this Protocol.\r\n\r\nAfter having given an account of the contents of the report of the\r\nNorwegian Government, the Minister proceeded to say:\r\n\r\n»The report of the Norwegian Government does not lead to any alteration\r\nof the recommendation[84:1] previously made by me. I venture however, to\r\ndraw attention to the fact that, if it has been impossible to come to\r\nterms about the present question, the principal cause of it should be\r\nsought in the present arrangement for treating questions affecting the\r\nrelations between the United Kingdoms and Foreign Powers. That this\r\narrangement does not satisfy the positions of the two countries within\r\nthe Union, has long been admitted.\r\n\r\nIn connection with what was expressed by all the Swedish and the\r\nNorwegian Cabinet Ministers who signed the above-mentioned document of\r\nMarch 24, 1903, I want therfore, to emphasize the desirability that the\r\nquestion as to arranging on other principles the management of Foreign\r\naffairs should again be taken up for negotiations between the two\r\ncountries. I do not, however, find any reason now to make proposal as to\r\ntaking steps to that end; I only refer to what I have previously\r\nadvocated».\r\n\r\nWhat the Minister had thus stated and recommended, was endorsed by the\r\nother members of the Swedish Cabinet Council.\r\n\r\nThe Norwegian part of the Cabinet Council referred to the Norwegian\r\nGovernment's humble report of the 6th inst. and proceeded to state that\r\nin its opinion a solution of the question at issue might, in the way\r\nexpressed by the Swedish Cabinet ministers in the document of March 24,\r\n1903, also have been found with the present arrangement for treating\r\nForeign affairs. The Norwegian part of the Cabinet Council naturally\r\nagreed upon the opinion that this arrangement did not harmonize with the\r\npositions of the two countries within the Union. Whereas, however, the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs, on the plea of the document of March 24,\r\n1903, had pointed out the desirability that the question as to arranging\r\non other principles the management of Foreign affairs should again be\r\ntaken up for negotiation between the two countries, the Norwegian part of\r\nthe Cabinet Council could not forbear to hold forth, partly that the said\r\ndocument presupposed a solution of the question as an independent case,\r\npartly that, after the recent occurrences in the Consular question, the\r\nchances of further negotiations between the two countries, concerning the\r\nabove-mentioned matters, were considerably clouded.\r\n\r\n_His Majesty the King_ was hereupon pleased to dictate:\r\n\r\n»In the present state of things I find Myself unable to take any other\r\nresolution than to assent to what has been recommended to Me by the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs. But I cannot forbear to express to My\r\npeoples My heart-felt desire that the two Kingdoms, united almost a\r\ncentury ago, shall never suffer any differences of opinion to endanger\r\nthe Union itself. The latter is truly the safest security for the\r\nindependence, the safety and the happiness of the Scandinavian Peninsula\r\nand her two peoples».\r\n\r\nUpon this, the Norwegian part of the Cabinet Council stated that they, in\r\nall humility, had ventured to dissuade His Majesty from making this\r\ndictate.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the recommendations made by the Swedish and the\r\nNorwegian Cabinet Council, _His Majesty the King_ was pleased to resolve\r\nthat the commission entrusted to the Swedish and the Norwegian Cabinet\r\nCouncil in persuance of the King's resolution of December 21, 1903, shall\r\nnot lead to any further steps, and also to decree that the Protocols of\r\nthe Cabinet Council regarding this matter shall be published!\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[84:1] In Joint Cabinet Council of February 6 the Foreign Minister had\r\nrecommended that the task of negotiation, entrusted by the King to the\r\nCabinet Councils of the two countries, should not lead to any further\r\nsteps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11.\r\n\r\nThe note of the Crown-Prince-Regent to the special committee of the\r\nStorthing. Dated February 28, 1905.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is my wish to make the following declaration to the Committee. In\r\nthese fatal days I feel it a necessity to open My heart to you and I do\r\nso now only in the capacity of Norway's Regent.\r\n\r\nI fully understand the sentiments the Norwegian people, in these days,\r\nare animated with and that you as the loyal sons of the Fatherland in\r\npassing your resolutions will solely have in view the welfare of Norway.\r\nBut what is Norway's welfare, nay, I say with the same emphasis, what is\r\nthe welfare of both countries? I do not hesitate a moment to answer this\r\nquestion with the one word: Union.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore my sincerest hope and my strongest exhortation to you not\r\nto enter upon a way that leads to a rupture between the two peoples. It\r\nhas so often been said that the dynasty tries to look after its own\r\ninterests, but this is not true. The Union is not of paramount interest\r\nto the _dynasty_, but it should be so to the two _peoples_, for it is a\r\nvital condition for their happiness and future.\r\n\r\nThe Royal power has never tried to prevent Norway from obtaining her own\r\nConsular service. The only condition for the fulfilment of this desire\r\nis, and must be, that the relation to the joint administration of Foreign\r\naffairs should be arranged in a way securing the Union and that this\r\nmatter regarding both countries cannot be definitively settled until\r\nafter being treated in accordance with § 5 of the Act of Union. From My\r\nstandpoint as the Regent of the United Kingdoms I can never act otherwise\r\nthan as I consider useful to the existing Union to which I hold Myself\r\nbound to adhere.\r\n\r\nAn attempt has now been made on the way to partial reform, which I am\r\nsorry to say has been unsuccessful. But one should not therefore give up\r\neverything and enter into a way that, at any rate, cannot lead to the\r\nobobject preserved. But the logical consequence of this is to enter into\r\nnew negotiations with Sweden on a larger basis. And to such negotiations\r\non the basis of complete equality between the countries I declare Myself\r\nfully prepared to lend my assistance.\r\n\r\nI consider it my imperative duty openly to hold forth to you the great\r\ndangers and the fatal consequences for each people to follow their own\r\ncourse. United, we have at any rate a certain power and importance in the\r\nEuropean system of states but separated--how much the less the word of\r\nNorway or of Sweden would _then_ weigh! Therefore, may these peoples\r\nassigned by nature itself to hold together, also do so for the future!\r\n\r\nWhen I see all this stand out clearly to My inward eye, you, too will\r\nunderstand with what sincere and intense, and heart-felt sorrow I\r\nconsider thesituation we are in and the threatening turn matters now seem\r\nto take.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion I want only to add this: when you go to your task, do so\r\nwith entirely open eyes and consider carefully _all_ consequences of your\r\nactions. Each one may act according to his best convictions! God leads\r\nthe destinies of the peoples. May He give you and us all prudence so as\r\nto enter into the way that leads to the true welfare of the Fatherland\r\nand of the North.\r\n\r\nI want this my address to be published.\r\n\r\n  GUSTAF\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12.\r\n\r\nRecord of Justice-Department affair held at Stockholm Palace, on\r\nWednesday the 5th of April 1905 before His Royal Highness the\r\nCrown-Prince Regent in Joint Swedish and Norwegian Cabinet Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n[-- -- --]\r\n\r\nHis Royal Highness the Crown-Prince Regent declared:\r\n\r\n»I have to-day summond you to Joint Cabinet Council in order to make the\r\nfollowing address to you:\r\n\r\nI herewith exhort the Cabinet Councils of the United Kingdoms, on both\r\nsides without an one-sided adherence to standpoints formerly held, to\r\nimmediately enter into free and friendly negotiations concerning a new\r\narrangement of all matters affecting the Union, upon the fundamental\r\nprinciple that full equality between the countries should be tried to be\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\nThe way which, in My opinion, ought to be chosen and in which, as far as\r\nI know, with a little good intention on both sides a solution of the\r\ndifficulties satisfactory to all parties can be attained is this: Foreign\r\nMinister in common, be he a Swede or a Norwegian, responsible to both\r\ncountries or to a joint institution; separate Consular service for each\r\ncountry arranged however, in such a way that the Consuls, in everything\r\nregarding the relations to Foreign Powers, should be under the Foreign\r\nMinister's direction and control.\r\n\r\nIf, in the course of the negotiations, another form could be found for\r\narranging the affairs affecting the Union, always however with the\r\npreservation of the community in the management and charge of Foreign\r\naffairs, which is an indispensable condition to the existence of the\r\nUnion, I herewith declare myself, prepared to take also this form into\r\nearnest consideration.»\r\n\r\nMr. Berger, Chief of the Swedish Justice-Department, made the following\r\nstatement:\r\n\r\n»In connection with what your Royal Highness has been pleased to declare\r\nand while emphasizing the desirability of opening further negotiations as\r\nto arranging the Union affairs, I recommend in all humility to request in\r\npersuance of § 5 of the Act of Union, a report from the Norwegian\r\nGovernment as to the proposition of opening such negotiations.»\r\n\r\nWhat the president of the Justice-Department had thus stated and\r\nrecommended, was endorsed by the other members of the Swedish Cabinet\r\nCouncil.\r\n\r\nThe Norwegian section of the Cabinet Council stated that, at present, it\r\ndid not find any reason to give its opinion on the reality of the matter,\r\nbut, with reference to § 15 of the Norwegian Constitution and to § 5 of\r\nthe Act of Union, it confined itself in recommending the request of a\r\nreport from the Norwegian Government.\r\n\r\nHis Royal Highness the Crown-Prince Regent was graciously pleased to\r\ndecree that the Norwegian Government's report of the matter should be\r\nrequested.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13.\r\n\r\nMotion on the Union question in the First Chamber of the Swedish Riksdag.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to notification made in the »Post-och Inrikes Tidningar» of\r\nApril 6, this year, the Crown-Prince Regent has on the 5th of the same\r\nmonth in Joint Swedish and Norwegian Cabinet Council made the following\r\ndeclaration:\r\n\r\n[-- -- --]\r\n\r\nWhereas, through the exhortation thus addressed by the Crown-Prince\r\nRegent to the Cabinet Councils of the United Kingdoms, a suggestion of\r\nnew negotiations has been made, which ought to be able to lead to such a\r\nsolution of the Union affairs as may be approved of by both peoples, and\r\nwhereas the present state of things seems to occasion the Riksdag to give\r\nalready its opinion on the matter, we move,\r\n\r\n     that the Riksdag, in an address to His Majesty, may announce its\r\n     support of the declaration made by the Crown-Prince Regent in Joint\r\n     Swedish and Norwegian Cabinet Council on April 5th this year with a\r\n     view to bring about negotiations between the Swedish and Norwegian\r\n     Governments concerning, a new arrangement of the Union affairs.\r\n\r\nStockholm, April 12, 1905.\r\n\r\n  _Gustaf Ax. Berg._     _Gottfrid Billing._     _Gustaf Björlin._\r\n  _Hj. Palmstierna._    _Fredrik Pettersson._    _Gust. Tamm._\r\n          _R. Törnebladh._                 _Wilh. Walldén._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n14.\r\n\r\nMotion on the Union question in the Second Chamber of the Swedish\r\nRiksdag.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe declaration made by the Crown-Prince Regent in Joint Cabinet Council\r\nof the 5th inst. and published the day after in the »Post-och Inrikes\r\nTidningar», has given great satisfaction to us and certainly also to\r\nother friends of the Union, to whom the relation arisen between the\r\nsister countries after the failure of the consular negotiations, has\r\ncaused a great deal of anxiety. That new negotiations if brought about,\r\nwill have a decisive influence on the future of the Union, is obvious.\r\nThe worth of the Union, as well as the prospect of maintaining it for a\r\nconsiderable time to come, depend upon the two peoples voluntary\r\nadherence to it in the conviction that the Union involves advantages well\r\nworth of those restrictions in each peoples absolute right of self\r\ndetermination as are necessarily conditioned by it. Again, the failure of\r\nthe negotiations would evidently produce among the two peoples a general\r\nand settled opinion that an arrangement satisfactory to both cannot be\r\nfound within the Union, and such a conviction is sure to undermine its\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, it proves to be of importance for the Riksdag not to\r\npass in silence the suggestion of negotiations given in the\r\nabove-mentioned declaration, but to second it, if found satisfactory.\r\n\r\nIt seems to us that the Riksdag should not hesitate to take the latter\r\nalternative, since the declaration, while holding in wiew the necessary\r\ncommunion in the management of Foreign affairs and in the two peoples'\r\ncontrol of it, at the same time in consideration of its latter portion,\r\nhas the bearing that it should not preclude the possibility to attain a\r\nsolution satisfactory to both peoples.\r\n\r\nOn that account we beg leave to move:\r\n\r\n     that the Riksdag, in an address to His Majesty, may announce its\r\n     support of the declaration made by the Crown-Prince Regent in Joint\r\n     Swedish and Norwegian Cabinet Council on April 5th this year with a\r\n     view to bring about negotiations between the Swedish and Norwegian\r\n     Governments concerning a new arrangement of the Union affairs.\r\n\r\n  Stockholm, April 12, 1905.\r\n\r\n     _Carl Persson._     _Hans Andersson._     _Sixten von Friesen._\r\n  _Ernst Lindblad._  _D.

For the treatement of this matter the\r\nNorwegian Storthing has appointed a special Committee and in the\r\nimmediate future, this committee will prepare a motion that, in the\r\npresent sitting of the Storthing, a bill be to passed with regard to the\r\nestablishment of a separate Consular service.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the scheme propounded in Joint Cabinet Council should be\r\nbased on the supposition that the further advancement of the Consular\r\nquestion should, for the present, be deferred Norway's approval of such a\r\nsupposition would, in the opinion of the Department be equivalent to\r\ngiving up of the Norwegian people's unanimous desire to now see a just\r\nright carried through which is due to Norway in her capacity of a\r\nSovereign realm and is secured in her Constitution, and for a reform\r\nrequested with cumulative force by the development and the conditions of\r\nindustry, instead of entering into negotiations between the countries,\r\nwhich, after renewed experience, may unfortunately be apprehended to\r\nprove fruitless or at best, to delay the realisation of the matter.\r\n\r\nFor there is no denying the fact that the scheme for negotiations now\r\npropounded is nothing new, but that similar schemes in the earlier\r\nhistory of the Union have repeatedly been tried in vain. The three\r\nCommittees affecting the Union and made up of Norwegian and Swedish men,\r\nthat in the past century, after previous treatment in 1844, in 1867, and\r\nin 1898 propounded schemes for new regulations concerning the mutual\r\nrelations of the countries did not lead to any positive result. The\r\nreport of the first Committee was in 1847 subject to a treatment on the\r\npart of the Norwegian Government, but was afterwards not favoured by the\r\nSwedish Government; the report of the second Committee, which did not\r\ngive expression to Norway's equality in the Union was rejected by the\r\nvast majority of the Storthing in 1871 and in the third Committee no\r\nproposal of a future arrangement could obtain plurality among the\r\nNorwegian and the Swedish members.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the last-mentioned Committee we beg leave to draw\r\nparticular attention to the fact, that all the Swedish members of the\r\nCommittee certainly agreed upon founding the Union on the principle of\r\nparity and equality, inasmuch as they proposed that the Foreign affairs\r\nshould be entrusted to the charge of a joint Foreign minister of\r\nNorwegian or Swedish nationality. But at the same time the two fractions\r\nwherein the Swedish members of the Committee were divided, proposed such\r\nan arrangement of the constitutional responsibility not only for those\r\nmembers of the separate Cabinet Councils of the countries, who at the\r\nside of the Foreign Minister take part in the treatment of diplomatic\r\naffairs, but also for the Foreign Minister himself, so that no member of\r\nthe Norwegian Committee could in this respect support any of the Swedish\r\nschemes. In addition to the establishment of a joint Foreign Minister\r\noffice, all the Swedish members recommended an extension of the\r\nconstitutional community between the countries which no member of the\r\nNorwegian Committee could second and lastly, the scheme for a separate\r\nForeign Office for each country which already was the expression of the\r\nopinion prevailing among the Norwegian people, could not gain any support\r\nfrom the Swedish side.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it should also be remembered that equally fruitless\r\nproved the negotiations about the arrangement of the ministerial Cabinet\r\nCouncil, carried on between the two Governments in 1885-86 and in\r\n1890-91.\r\n\r\nIf thus the results of the above-mentioned efforts have been but little\r\nencouraging, this can, in a still higher degree, be said to have been the\r\ncase with the negotiations just now terminated concerning questions\r\nconnected with the establishment of a separate Consular service for each\r\ncountry. After these negotiations, brought about on Swedens initiative,\r\nhad led to a preliminary agreement presupposing a separate Consular\r\nservice for each country, subject to the home authority which each\r\ncountry decided for itself, and after this agreement had been approved of\r\nby the King and the Governments of the two countries in Joint Cabinet\r\nCouncil on December 21, 1903, the matter, as is well known, fell through\r\nowing to the so called bills of the same wording that were meant to\r\nregulate the relations between the separate Consular services on the one\r\nhand, and the Foreign Minister and the legations on the other hand. This\r\nnegative result was attributed to the circumstance that from the Swedish\r\nside a number of demands were finally made and adhered to, which are\r\npartly considered as incongruous with the Constitution of Norway and\r\nwith our rights as a Sovereign realm, partly would exclude what had been\r\npresupposed in the preliminary agreements viz. that the Consuls of each\r\ncountry should be subject to that home authority which each country\r\ndecided for itself. Through this, a deep disappointment has arisen in\r\nNorway which, if strengthened by new unsuccessful schemes, will imply the\r\ngreatest danger to the good relations between the two peoples which in a\r\nfar higher degree than agreements laid down in treatises or juridical\r\nforms are the basis of the concord and the strength of both peoples.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances the Department finds it necessary to dissuade\r\nfrom entering into new negotiations on the Union affairs ere a separate\r\nNorwegian Consular service has been established. Not until this has been\r\ndone, will the confidence return which is the condition of any friendly\r\nand successful consideration of embarrassing and delicate Union affairs,\r\nand the Department will then be able to recommend the opening of\r\nnegotiations for arranging the management of Foreign affairs and of the\r\ndiplomacy and about the present Union based on the Act of Union, and\r\nquestions connected with this matter. But, if so, these negotiations must\r\nbe carried on an entirely free basis with full recognition of the\r\nSovereignity of each country without any reservation or restriction\r\nwhatever and consequently also--in conformity with what occurred in\r\n1898--embrace the arrangement proposed by the Norwegian side as to the\r\nestablishment of a separate Norwegian and a separate Swedish Foreign\r\nOffice administration in such forms as each country will consider\r\nnecessary for its objects and interests. In harmony with this it should,\r\nbesides, be agreed upon that, if also new negotiations should prove\r\nfruitless one must not return to _status quo_ so as to adhere to the\r\npresent untenable state of Union affairs. There should be a binding\r\npresumption that the present state of things must not prevent either\r\ncountry from exercising its right of self-determination, but that instead\r\neach country can freely decide upon the future forms of its national\r\nexistence. For not a coercive union but only the mutual confidence and\r\nfeeling of solidarity of the free and independent nations can safeguard\r\nthe future and the happiness of both peoples and the independence and\r\nintegrity of their countries.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the above-mentioned statement endorsed in substance by\r\nthe other members of the Cabinet Council, it is recommended in all\r\nhumility:\r\n\r\n     that a copy of the present humble report made in Joint Cabinet\r\n     Council on April 5th this year, concerning new negotiations\r\n     affecting the Union may graciously be ordered to be delivered over\r\n     to the Swedish Iustice-Department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n16.\r\n\r\nRecord of Justice-Departement affair held at Stockholm Palace on Tuesday\r\nthe 25th of April, 1905 before His Royal Highness the Crown-Prince Regent\r\nin Joint Swedish and Norwegian Cabinet Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n[-- -- --]\r\n\r\nMr Berger, Cabinet Minister and Chief of the Swedish Justice-Department\r\ngave, in all humility, a notice of the Norwegian Government's humble\r\nreport in consequence of the question raised in Joint Cabinet Council on\r\nthe 5th inst. vith regard to opening new negotiations concerning the\r\narrangement of the Union question; this report is appended to this\r\nProtocol.\r\n\r\nAfter the chief of Department had given an account of the contents of the\r\nreport, His Excellency Ramstedt, Prime Minister made the following\r\nstatement:\r\n\r\n»What in the Norwegian Governments report has been said about the reason\r\nwhy the latest negotiations, regarding the Union did not lead to any\r\nresult, does not, in my opinion, now require a reply, but in this\r\nrespect, I only refer to the Swedish Cabinet Council's declaration of\r\nJanuary 30, 1905, appended to the Protocol made in Joint Cabinet Council\r\non the 6th of February last.\r\n\r\nIn the declaration made by your Royal Highness on the 5th inst. and put\r\non record, the Swedish Cabinet Council expected to find a method of\r\nsettling the differences of opinion as to the Union affairs. Therefore\r\nthe Swedish Cabinet Council gave its support to your Royal Highness's\r\ndeclaration.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the new negotiations, however, was, according to the\r\nsame declaration, that the negotiations should embrace all matters\r\naffecting the Union and consequently also the Consular question.\r\n\r\nWhereas now from the Norwegian side the thought of further negotiations\r\nis rejected, ere a separate Norwegian Consular service has been\r\nestablished and whereas besides, for eventual new negotiations, such a\r\ncondition is made from the Norwegian side as incompatible with the Union\r\nand the Act of Union, it is obvious that negotiations on the basis\r\nindicated by your Royal Highness cannot now be opened with any chance of\r\nsuccess».\r\n\r\nThis statement was endorsed by the other members of the Swedish Cabinet\r\nCouncil.\r\n\r\nThe Norwegian part of the Cabinet Council stated:\r\n\r\n»The section of the Cabinet Council refers to the report of the Norwegian\r\nGovernment from which it appears that on the Norwegian side there is\r\nwillingness to bring about negotiations between the countries on the\r\nconditions put forward in the report. It is also obvious from the report\r\nthat from the Norwegian side the intention is not to try to dissolve the\r\npresent Union. On the other hand, one finds it necessary to demand that\r\nsuch a dissolution should be within the bounds of possibility and that\r\nnegotiations presupposing this eventuality with the consent of the\r\nConstitution authorities of both countries, should be compatible with the\r\nAct of Union.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, however, the section of the Cabinet Council\r\nthat negotiations concerning the Union affairs cannot, agree for the\r\npresent, opened with any chance of success.»\r\n\r\nHis Royal Highness the Crown-Prince Regent was hereupon pleased he to\r\ndeclare:\r\n\r\n»Whereas the Norwegian Government has unfortunately been unwilling to\r\naccept my proposition of new negotiations concerning all the affairs\r\naffecting the Union, I must, while sincerely regretting it, let the\r\nmatter abide by the declarations made by the Cabinet Councils.»\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n17.\r\n\r\nThe Riksdags address to the King on the Union question, on May 15, 1905.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO HIS MAJESTY THE KING.\r\n\r\nIn both Chambers of the Riksdag resolutions have been submitted with the\r\nobject of expressing, in an address, to your Majesty the Riksdag's\r\nsupport of the declaration published in the »Post-och Inrikes Tidningar»\r\nand made by the Crown-Prince Regent in Joint Swedish and Norwegian\r\nCabinet Council on the 5th of April last.\r\n\r\nThis declaration is to the following effect:\r\n\r\n[-- -- --]\r\n\r\nThe Riksdag realizes to the full the importance of this declaration of\r\nthe Crown-Prince Regent, as involving a possibility of bringing about a\r\nnew satisfactory arrangement of the Union affairs.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore with an expression of regret that the Riksdag has learned\r\nfrom the publishment of the Protocol drawn up in Joint Swedish and\r\nNorwegian Cabinet Council on the 25th of April last, that negotiations\r\nfounded on the basis indicated in the above-mentioned declaration of the\r\nCrown-Prince Regent cannot now be opened with any chance of success.\r\n\r\nAlthough thus the question of such negotiations seems to have been\r\ndropped for the present, the Riksdag, however, considers itself bound to\r\nexpress its opinion on a question of such a far-reaching importance as\r\nthe present one, and consequently the Riksdag has resolved to announce\r\nherewith its support of the declaration made by the Crown-Prince Regent\r\nin Joint Swedish and Norwegian Cabinet Council on April 5th this year,\r\nand recommending the opening of negotiations between the Swedish and\r\nNorwegian Governments concerning a new arrangement of the Union affairs.\r\n\r\nStockholm, May 13, 1905.\r\n\r\n  With all loyal veneration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n18.\r\n\r\nThe resignation of the Norwegian Government. Dated Christiania, May 26,\r\n1905.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO HIS MAJESTY THE KING.\r\n\r\nIn case Your Majesty should find yourself unable to acquiesce in the\r\nNorwegian Government's recommendation to sanction the Storthing's\r\nresolution for the establishment of a separate Norwegian Consular\r\nservice, we venture, in all humility, to apply for permission to\r\nimmediately resign our posts as members of Your Majesty's Cabinet, since\r\nnone of us well be able to countersign a resolution considered by us as\r\nnoxious to the country. A rejection of this unanimous recommendation of\r\nthe Government concerning a Norwegian law unanimously adopted by the\r\nStorthing and issued by the whole Norwegian people to be carried through\r\ncannot, in our opinion, be grounded on regards paid to the interests of\r\nNorway, but would involve an abnegation of the Sovereignity of the\r\ncountry, and would be a manifestation of a personal Royal power in\r\nopposition to the Constitution and to constitutional practice.\r\n\r\nChristiania, May 26, 1905.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n19.\r\n\r\nReport of the Cabinet Council held in Stockholm May 30th 1905, given by\r\nthe Norwegian Section of the Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n  To the President of the Norwegian Government.\r\n\r\nThe Section of the Cabinet Council herewith presents the following\r\nreport.\r\n\r\nIn the Cabinet Council held by the King at the Royal Palace in Stockholm\r\non May 27th the Norwegian Government presented their proposal respecting\r\nthe sanction of the Storthing to the Norwegian Consular law. After which\r\nthe members of the Section expressed their unanimity respecting the\r\nproposals, and urgently appealed to the King to sanction them. They\r\nemphasized the reform in question for the development of the country in a\r\nnational and economical respect, which was unanimously approved of both\r\nby the National Assembly and also the whole of the people of Norway.\r\nThere might be many differences of opinion and divergencies on various\r\npublic affairs, but in this case, there was complete unanimity among all\r\nparties and communities. The Storthing, in conjunction with the\r\ngovernment, had omitted from the law such questions as might have\r\nreference to the points that touched upon the Foreign and Diplomatic\r\nadministration and dealt with the Consular question alone.\r\n\r\nTherefore it was thought that all cause of opposition would, on this\r\nside, be removed. It was therefore the nation's sincere hope, that His\r\nMajesty would graciously incline to their appeal.\r\n\r\n  The King\r\n\r\nthereupon read the following reply.\r\n\r\n»The Crown-Prince as Regent in a joint Cabinet Council on the 5th April\r\nhas already pointed out the only way, in which this important matter can\r\nbe presented, and all difficulties thereby be removed, that is, by\r\nnegotiation. I give this decision my entire approval, and do not find the\r\npresent moment suitable for sanctioning the law, which implies a change\r\nin the existing partnership in the Consular Service, which cannot be\r\ndissolved except by mutual agreement. The present regulation is\r\nestablished in consequence of a resolution in a Joint Cabinet Council,\r\nand therefore a separate Consular Service cannot be established either\r\nfor Sweden or for Norway before the matter has been dealt with in the\r\nsame Constitutional forms prescribed by the Act of Union § 5. In refusing\r\nnow to give My sanction to this law, I am supported by §§ 30 and 78 in\r\nthe Constitutional law, which give the King this right. The equal love I\r\nbear to my two peoples, makes it my duty to exercise this right.»\r\n\r\nThe Section of the Cabinet Council resolved first to institute further\r\nnegotiations in the Cabinet Council in Christiania, in order that His\r\nMajesty might deal with this important matter, which might lead to a\r\nserious crisis in the government then in office.\r\n\r\n  The King\r\n\r\ndeclared Himself unwilling to assent to this appeal and pointed out that\r\nthe Norwegian government's proposal was received and dealt with.\r\n\r\nThereupon the Section of the Cabinet Council made the strongest\r\nrepresentations in reference to His Majesty's decision, which would rouse\r\ncomplaints in Norway, where they had hoped that the persistent and loyal\r\nefforts to solve the problem through negotiations with Sweden, would have\r\nled to happy results in reference to the rights and claims of the\r\nKingdom. In this case Norway's interests in the Union were equal with\r\nthose of Sweden. For that Norway's rights were respected, was a necessary\r\ncondition for a safe guarantee of the Union. A resolution after His\r\nMajesty's decision against the unanimous proposal of the government, and\r\nafter a declaration which was given with Norwegian advice, would have\r\nincalculable results. It was in conflict without Constitutional law, it\r\nwas denial of the right according to fundamental law of independent\r\ndecision on the matter, and a violation of its liberty, independence, and\r\nSovereignty. It would inevitably lead to the dissolution of the Union.\r\n\r\nThe Section of the Cabinet Council further stated that no member of the\r\npresent Council would countersign such a resolution, and thus give it\r\nconstitutional legality. They must therefore tender their letters of\r\nresignation.\r\n\r\n  His Majesty the King\r\n\r\nthen read the following reply:\r\n\r\n»As it is evident to Me that a new government cannot now be formed I\r\ncannot consent to he resignation of the Ministers.»\r\n\r\nFurthermore His Majesty referred to the Constitution § 30, and affirmed\r\nthat the Ministers had now dutifully »expressed their opinions with\r\nboldness», and »made strong representations» against His decision;\r\ntherefore they were free from responsibility. But the same paragraph\r\nreserved to the King the right to make his decisions, »according to His\r\nown judgment.» He was therefore entitled, according to fundamental law,\r\nto make the above mentioned decision, and it was the duty of the\r\nMinisters to draw up and countersign the protocol respecting the\r\nnegotiations and agreements on the matter.\r\n\r\nThe Section of Ministers hereupon alleged that according to the\r\nConstitutional law § 15 the Prime Minister was the responsible executive\r\nfor the accepted resolutions. Until the decision had been countersigned,\r\nit was not obligatory; a report could, naturally, be given of the\r\nnegotiations, but not the customary protocol, including also a Royal\r\ndecree.\r\n\r\nCountersignature implied responsibility for the King's decisions, but in\r\nthis case the government could not take that responsibility. It was\r\nprescribed in the Constitution § 31 for all commands issued by the King\r\n(except affairs relating to military orders). But this conclusion was not\r\na regular rule for the members of the Cabinet; it was a prescription for\r\nthe forms to be observed in order to give a command legal validity.\r\nOccasions might therefore occur when it was not only right, but also a\r\nduty to refuse countersignature. The Section of the Cabinet Council had\r\nappealed to the Justice-Departement for enlightenment on the subject, and\r\nthey knew that there had been several occasions when the Norwegian side\r\nhad maintained the same opinions as those now presented.\r\n\r\nThe Departement now comes to the same conclusion as in 1847 when it\r\ndiscussed the question in another agreement namely in a Resolution on the\r\nintended proposal for a new Act of Union; in this there is a reference to\r\nthe Norwegian conception that there is nothing to prevent a member of the\r\nCouncil from refusing countersignature and resigning his office. This\r\nResolution is accepted by the Government then in office: Lovenskiold,\r\nKrog, Sibbern, Schmidt, Pettersen, Herm. Foss and Fr. Stang and by the\r\nmembers then forming the Section of the Cabinet Council, Due, J. H. Vogt\r\nand Fleischer.\r\n\r\nThe Section of the Cabinet Council finally decided that as a refusal to\r\nsanction would manifestly not be only injurious to the Kingdom, but also\r\na denial of its Self-dependence, it had become a necessity to refuse\r\ncountersignature, in order to avoid being a party in the matter. The\r\nNorwegian who did countersign would from that moment lose all national\r\nrights.\r\n\r\nAfter which the letters of resignation from the Norwegian Government, and\r\nfrom the Section of the Cabinet Council were delivered and read in the\r\npresence of the King. Respecting this matter, the customary protocol has\r\nbeen drawn up.\r\n\r\nKristiania 30:th May 1905.\r\n\r\n  _J. Lovland._    _E.

Dated Stockholm, May 29, 1905.\r\n\r\n\r\nStockholm, May 29. On account of what the Norwegian Government has\r\ndeclared--not only in writing in their resignations, but also verbally\r\nin the Cabinet Council of May 27 after my rejection of the Consular\r\nservice law--I must declare that I, most decidedly, protest against the\r\ncomments made there on Me and my method of action. I adhere to everything\r\nI have stated to the assembled Cabinet Council as to my constitutional\r\nright. I beg the Premie minister to give publicity to this as soon as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n  _Oscar._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n21.\r\n\r\nThe Norwegian Cabinet Minister's notification to the King that they\r\nresigned their posts. Dated Christiania, Juni 6, 1905.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn response to our humble resignations, Your Majesty has in Cabinet\r\nCouncil at the Palace of Stockholm on May 27th, decreed: »As it is clear\r\nto me that no other Cabinet can at present be formed, I decline to accept\r\nthe resignations tendered by the Cabinet Ministers.»\r\n\r\nAccording to Norway's Constitution it is incumbent on the King to procure\r\na constitutional Government for the country. In the same moment as the\r\nKings policy is an obstacle to the formation of a responsible Council the\r\nNorwegian Royal power has become in-operative.\r\n\r\nBy your Majesty's resolution therefore, the constitutional relation\r\nbetween Your Majesty and the responsible Ministers of the Crown has\r\nassumed such an aspect as cannot be maintained. No Government and none of\r\nits members individually can, in a constitutional country, be forced\r\nagainst their wishes to remain in office with a Ministers responsibility,\r\nwhen their responsible advice in great questions decisive to the\r\nFatherland is not followed by the King who, in persuace of the\r\nconstitution, is exempt from responsibility whereas under these\r\ncircumstances it is the undoubted right of each member individually as a\r\nfree man to resign his post, this will also, as a rule, be a duty towards\r\nthe Fatherland in order to maintain its constitutional rights.\r\n\r\nYour Majesty has declared that no Government can, at present, be formed.\r\nYour Majesty has found this so clear that Norway's King in these fatal\r\ndays has remained at the Palace of Stockholm without making an attempt at\r\nbringing the country back to constitutional conditions.\r\n\r\nThe policy manifested in Your Majesty's attitude towards the question of\r\nsanctioning the Consular service law is, in our opinion, incompatible\r\nwith the Norwegian Constitution. But no more than a new Government is\r\nable to take upon itself the responsibility of this policy, no more are\r\nwe able in office to render us participant of it by remaining in office.\r\nIt is therefore our duty to resign our posts and to immediately give the\r\nStorthing the necessary communication of it.\r\n\r\nThis shall now be done. Deep and discordant political divergencies have\r\nthus burst the frame of the constitutional Norwegian Monarchy.\r\nCircumstances have been stranger than the desire of the individual. But\r\nthe final settlement on the dissolution of the Union, that through Your\r\nMajesty's resolution--no doubt passed with a heavy heart, but also with\r\nfull knowledge of its consequences--has now been started, will however,\r\n--this is our hope--turn out before long to have been the introduction\r\nto better and happier days for the two peoples, whose happiness and\r\nwelfare have always been dear to Your Majesty's heart.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion we venture to tender Your Majesty our humblest thanks for\r\nthe personal kindness and amiability shown to us during the time we have\r\nhad the honour of being members of Your Majesty's Council.\r\n\r\nWe beg Your Majesty to accept the assurance of our full recognition of\r\nYour Majesty's difficult position and of our invaried esteem. But\r\nparamount are our duties towards the Fatherland.\r\n\r\nChristiania, June 6, 1905.\r\n\r\n   _Chr. Michelsen._  _J. Lövland._  _Sofus Arctander._  _Gunnar Knudsen._\r\n   _W. Olssön._   _E.

In meetings of the\r\nrepresentatives, the question has therefore been discussed as to what\r\nmeasures would be taken by the Storthing to meet the necessities of such\r\na situation. Every representative has had an opportunity for making known\r\nhis personal opinions at these meetings respecting the situation and its\r\ndemands. On this day the Storthing must make known its decisive\r\nresolutions. I must also permit myself to express the wish, that these\r\nresolutions may be unanimously accepted, and without debate.\r\n\r\nIn respect to the communication given by the head of the Government I\r\npropose that the Storthing shall make the following resolutions:\r\n\r\nThe different members of the Council having resigned office,\r\n\r\nHis Majesty the King having declared Himself unable to form a new\r\ngovernment, and the Constitutional Sovereign having resigned his powers,\r\n\r\nthe Storthing authorizes the members of the Council who resigned this\r\nday, to assume until further notice, as the Norwegian government, the\r\nauthority granted the King in accordance with the Constitution of the\r\nNorwegian Kingdom and its valid law--with the changes that become\r\nnecessary through the fact that the Union with Sweden under one King is\r\ndissolved as a consequence of the King having ceased to act as King of\r\nNorway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n24.\r\n\r\nThe address of the Storthing to King Oscar, dated Christiania, June 7,\r\n1905.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Your Majesty,\r\n\r\nWhereas all the members of the Cabinet have to-day, in the Storthing,\r\nresigned their posts, and whereas Your Majesty in the Protocol of May 27\r\nofficially declared that Your Majesty did not see your way clear to\r\ncreate a new Government for the country, the Constitutional Regal power\r\nin Norway has thereby become inoperative.\r\n\r\nIt has therefore been the duty of the Storthing, as the representative\r\nof the Norwegian people, without delay to empower the members of the\r\nresigning Cabinet to exercise until further notice as the Norwegian\r\nGovernment the power appertaining to the King in accordance with the\r\nConstitution of the Kingdom of Norway and the existing laws with the\r\nchanges which are necessitated by the fact that the union with Sweden,\r\nwhich provides that there shall be a common King, is dissolved in\r\nconsequence of the fact that the King has ceased to act as King of\r\nNorway.\r\n\r\nThe course of developments, which proved more powerful than the desire\r\nand will of the individual, has led to this result.\r\n\r\nThe union entered into in 1814 has from its first hour been differently\r\ninterpreted by the two nations both as regards its spirit and letter.\r\nEfforts have been made on the Swedish side to extend the Union, and on\r\nthe Norwegian side to confine it within the limits laid down in the Act\r\nof Union, and otherwise to assert the independent power of both States in\r\nall matters which are not defined in that Act as coming under the Union.\r\nThe difference of principle in the interpretation of the character of the\r\nUnion has provoked much misunderstanding between the two peoples, and has\r\ncaused much friction. In the interpretation which, during the last\r\nnegotiations between the two countries, has been laid down by the Swedish\r\nGovernment as against Norway, the Norwegian people were bound to perceive\r\nan injury to their constitutional right, their independence, and their\r\nnational honour.\r\n\r\nThe Union was justified as long as it could contribute to promoting the\r\nwelfare and happiness of both peoples, while maintaining their\r\nindependence as Sovereign States. But above the Union their stands for us\r\nNorwegians our Norwegian Fatherland, and for the Swedes their Swedish\r\nFatherland. And more valuable than a political union are the feelings of\r\nsolidarity and voluntary cohesion of both peoples. The union has become a\r\ndanger to this feeling of solidarity between the Norwegian and Swedish\r\npeople which should secure the happiness of both nations and constitute\r\ntheir strength abroad.\r\n\r\nWhen the union is now severed, the Norwegian people have no loftier wish\r\nthan to live in peace and good harmony with all, not least with the\r\npeople of Sweden and the dynasty under the direction of which our\r\ncountry, despite many and bitter disputes affecting the union, has\r\nattained such important intellectual and material development.\r\n\r\nAs evidence of the fact that the work and the struggle of the Norwegian\r\npeople for the full independence of the Fatherland have not been formed\r\non any ill-feeling towards the Royal House or the Swedish people, and\r\nhave not left behind any bitterness towards any of these, the Storthing\r\nrespectfully solicits your Majesty's co-operation to the end that a\r\nPrince of your Majesty's house may be permitted, while relinquishing his\r\nright of succession to the Throne of Sweden, to accept election as King\r\nof Norway.\r\n\r\nThe day upon which the Norwegian people elect their own King to ascend\r\nthe ancient throne of Norway will open up an era of tranquil conditions\r\nof industry for Norway, of good and cordial relations to the Swedish\r\npeople, and of peace and concord and loyal co-operation in the north for\r\nthe protection of the civilization of the people and of their freedom and\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\nIn full assurance of this, the Storthing ventures to express the sincere\r\nhope, that the present events, will turn out to be for the good of all,\r\nalso for their Majesties, for whom personally the Norwegian people will\r\npreserve their respect and affection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n25.\r\n\r\nThe King's telegraphic protest against the resolution of the Storthing.\r\nDespatched June 8th 1905.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs We hereby declare that We do not approve of the revolutionary measures\r\nwhich have been deplorably taken by the Storthing in violation of the\r\nConstitution and Act of Union, and in revolt against their King, We\r\nrefuse to receive the deputation proposed by the Storthing.\r\n\r\n  _Oscar._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n26.\r\n\r\nExtract of the protocol of Civil business held in Council before His\r\nMajesty in the presence of His Royal Highness The Crown Prince at the\r\nRoyal Palace Stocholm June 9th 1905.\r\n\r\n\r\n[-- -- --]\r\n\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ramstedt, Prime Minister, stated:\r\n\r\n»According to information received from Norway the Norwegian Storthing\r\nhas, on the 7th inst. passed the following resolutions:\r\n\r\n'The members of the Cabinet having resigned their office and the King\r\nhaving declared himself unable to form a new government; and the\r\nConstitutional Sovereign thereby having resigned His powers, the\r\nStorthing authorises the members of the Council who resigned this day, to\r\nassume until further notice, as the Norwegian Government, the authority\r\ngranted to the King according to the Constitution of the Norwegian\r\nKingdom and its valid law--with the changes that become neccessary\r\nthrough the fact that the Union with Sweden under one King is dissolved,\r\nin consequence of the King having ceased to Act as King of Norway.'\r\n\r\nThrough this revolutionary measure, the Storthing has not only without\r\nthe King's assistance, but also without referring to Sweden arbitrarily\r\npassed a resolution respecting the dissolution of a Union which has\r\nexisted on the grounds of legal mutual agreements between the two\r\ncountries and cannot without mutual consent be broken.\r\n\r\nThe Storthing, having thus by this resolution, violated Sweden's\r\nprerogative it becomes undeniably necessary that an extra session of the\r\nDiet be immediately summoned in order to debate as to what measures\r\nshould be taken on Sweden's side, with reference to what has thus\r\noccurred. Herewith I appeal that Your Majesty will resolve on the\r\nsummoning of the Diet, at the same time Your Majesty intimates\r\ndisacknowledgement of the government, proclaimed by the Storthing».\r\n\r\nIn this address the rest of the members proclaimed themselves unanimous;\r\n\r\nAnd His Majesty the King consented to this, and in accordance with the\r\nPrime Minister's recommendation was graciously pleased to decree, by open\r\nletter and edict, the import of which are contained in the appendage to\r\nthis protocol, that the members of both Chambers of the Diet be summoned\r\nto an extra session in Stockholm on Tuesday June 20th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n27.\r\n\r\nAddress from the King to the President of the Storthing.\r\n\r\n\r\n  To the President of the Storthing!\r\n\r\nTo you, and through you to the Storthing and the entire population of\r\nNorway, I address the following words, in answer to the address and\r\ndecision both of the Norwegian Cabinet and the Storthing:\r\n\r\nThe oath that the King of Norway takes according to the Constitution § 9\r\non his accession to the throne, »that he will rule the Kingdom of Norway\r\nin accordance with its constitution and law», makes it a kingly duty for\r\nMe not to pay any attention to the statement of the Norwegian Cabinet in\r\nreference to my decree on May 27th ult., in which I declared, that, for\r\nthe present, I did not find it suitable to sanction the Storthing's\r\nproposal respecting the establishment of a separate Norwegian Consular\r\nService. The Cabinet thereby declared that this decree, being in conflict\r\nwith the unanimous recommendation of the Norwegian Cabinet would imply a\r\ndepreciation of a right in accordance with the Norwegian fundamental law,\r\nindependently to settle the matter in question, and also implied a\r\nviolation of Norway's freedom, independence and Sovereignty, and at the\r\nsame time the Cabinet declared that no member of the Ministry then\r\nsitting would be willing to countersign My Decree, and thereby, according\r\nto the opinion of the Cabinet, give it legislative validity.\r\n\r\nThe Norwegian King's prerogative, when he thinks the welfare of the\r\nkingdom demands it, to refuse His sanction to a proposal presented in due\r\nform by the Storthing is unconditional. From this rule, there is no\r\nexception even though the Storthing were to present the same resolution\r\never so many times in precisely the same terms. Meanwhile according to\r\nthe fundamental law (Constitution § 79) the decision of the Storthing\r\nbecomes the law of Norway without the sanction of the King, but in order\r\nto accomplish this, are required unaltered resolutions from three\r\nStorthings drawn up after three consecutive elections, which resolution\r\nmust be laid before the King, »with an appeal, that His Majesty will not\r\nrefuse to sanction the resolution, which the Storthing after the most\r\ncareful considerations, believes to be advantageous. In the case now in\r\nhand, there was no question of any such resolution from the Storthing,\r\nand therefore the regulation in the fundamental law § 78: could be\r\nsuitably applied: »If the King sanctions the resolution, He signs it with\r\nHis superscription, on which it becomes the law. If He does not sanction\r\nit, He returns it to the Odelsthing (Lower House) with the declaration\r\nthat for the present He finds it unsuitable to sanction.» And the\r\nparagraph continues: »The resolution may not again on that occasion be\r\nlaid before the King by the members of the Storthing then assembled.» By\r\nthis last mentioned prescription the Constitution has evidently meant to\r\nprotect the Norwegian King's liberty in the exercise of the legislative\r\npowers which are his indisputable right.\r\n\r\nMy resolve, not to sanction a law providing for a separate Norwegian\r\nConsular Service, can consequently not be considered to imply any\r\ntransgression whatever of the legislative power, which according to the\r\nfundamental law is the King's right, not even, if the matter in question\r\nhappened to be an affair which concerned Norway alone. But on the grounds\r\nof the valid Union agreement between Norway and Sweden, it was not only\r\nMy right, but also My duty as King of Norway to refuse My sanction, for\r\nthe dissolution of the existing identical Consular Office could only be\r\neffected through Norway's consent to free and friendly negotiations\r\nconcerning agreements for altering the Union on the basis of full\r\nequality between the United Kingdoms, to which not only the _Powers\r\nRoyal_, but also the Diet of Sweden had unanimously themselves agreed.\r\nThat such a respect to the demands of the existing Union should imply an\r\nattack on Norway's independence and sovereignty, is so much the more\r\nunfounded, as the fundamental law explicitly connects Norway's\r\nindependence with its Union with Sweden. Norway's King must ever hold in\r\nsight the 1:st paragraph of its Constitution:\r\n\r\n»The Kingdom of Norway is a free, self-dependant, integral and\r\nindependent Kingdom, united with Sweden under one King.»\r\n\r\nThe statement made by the Council that My resolve, not to sanction the\r\nConsular law, proposed by the Storthing, would have no legal validity, as\r\nnone of the members of the Cabinet had found themselves able to\r\ncountersign the Royal Decree supplies a supposition which I must declare\r\nis in conflict with fundamental law. The question of the significance of\r\ncontrasignature according to Norwegian State law, is not a new question\r\nbrought up to day, but is older than the present Norwegian Constitution.\r\nIt was already solved at the Convention of Eidsvold. A proposal was then\r\nmade that Countersignature was requisite in order that the King's\r\ncommands should become valid, but was opposed on the grounds that it was\r\nagainst the general principles of the Constitution for the division of\r\nsupreme power. The same standpoint was taken in the fundamental law of\r\nthe 4th November. This opinion was also expressed by the Constitutional\r\nCommittee without contradiction on two occasions, 1824 and 1839, when the\r\nStorthing had even opposed a proposal concerning another matter. The\r\nchange, which § 32 in the Constitution has since undergone, gives\r\nincreased support to the opinion that the Prime Minister's\r\nCountersignature is intended for nothing else than a witness that the\r\nKing has made a Decree of certain import.\r\n\r\nAnd that § 31 is unconditional in its prescription of the duty of the\r\nauthorised countersignature of the Prime Minister is a conception that is\r\nacceded to by those writers on State law who have framed the\r\nConstitution. When the Cabinet quoted an opinion of the Norwegian\r\ngovernment in 1847 when the proposal for a new Act of Union was under\r\nconsideration, the Cabinet has overlooked, firstly, that this opinion, in\r\na manner that applies to Swedish government regulations § 38, was\r\nintended only to refer to orders issued but not the Decree of the King\r\nincluded in the protocol, secondly that the Norwegian Government could\r\nnot prove that the Norwegian Constitution really provided any law\r\nrespecting the right to refuse countersignature. The Constitution on the\r\ncontrary emphatically prescribes in § 30: »But to the King it is reserved\r\nthe right to form his decision according to His own judgment», and in §\r\n31: »All Commands issued by the King himself (Military Orders excepted)\r\nshall be countersigned by the Prime Minister (before 1873 the Norwegian\r\nPrime Minister).\r\n\r\nThat under these circumstances I feel Myself entitled to demand respect\r\nfor a Decree formed by the King of Norway in a Constitutional manner, is\r\na matter for which no one can blame me. The powers which the Constitution\r\ngrants the King, in order to further the good of the country to the best\r\nof his convictions, are not greater than that they ought to be preserved\r\nto the supreme power, so that no constitutional practices in conflict\r\nwith the principles of the fundamental law are introduced, which,\r\naccording to the explicit prescriptions in § 112 may not be done, even by\r\nan alteration of the fundamental law.\r\n\r\nOne of the chief principles of the Constitution--the most important of\r\nall, in point of fact--is that Norway shall be a Constitutional\r\nMonarchy. It is incompatible with this, that the King should sink to be a\r\nhelpless tool in the hands of His Ministers. If, meanwhile, the members\r\nof the Council should have the power, by refusing countersignature, to\r\nhinder every future Royal Decree, the Norwegian King would be deprived of\r\nparticipating in the government. This position would be as lowering to\r\nthe Monarch as injurious to Norway herself.\r\n\r\nTo the circumstances that can thus be adduced against the validity,\r\naccording to fundamental law, of the Prime Minister's refusal of\r\nCountersignature, and against the efficacy of the dogma that the King's\r\nDecree in order to be valid, must bear the responsibility of some member\r\nof the Cabinet, can be added, in questions touching the Union situation,\r\ntwo more reasons, which have their foundation in the fact that the King\r\nof Norway is also King of the Union.\r\n\r\nHowever opinions may have varied, respecting the conception of the unity\r\nwhich the Union agreements have created for the binding together of the\r\ntwo Kingdoms, one fact remains clear, that Royal power is also an\r\ninstitution of the Union. This position of the King's as being not only\r\nKing of Norway or of Sweden, but also as Monarch of the United Kingdoms,\r\nmakes it the King's duty, not to form decisions in conflict with the Act\r\nof Union § 5, respecting the settlement of matters in one country, which\r\nwould also affect the other. The King's duty in the aforesaid respect is\r\nincompatible with the opinion that the one Kingdom, by the refusal of\r\nCountersignature by its Prime Minister or otherwise, could undo a Royal\r\nDecree, by which he refused to make a resolution prejudicial to the other\r\nKingdom or injurious to the Union. In Norway, when they endeavoured to\r\nadhere to an opposite opinion, when the Norwegian people claimed the\r\nright to force the King to form his decision in conflict with what he\r\nconsiders his right as King of the Union to concede, there was no other\r\nway of attaining this object than making the Union, and also the King of\r\nSweden, in his actions, totally dependent on the will of the Norwegian\r\npeople, its Storthing and its Cabinet.\r\n\r\nA Sovereign power of this kind I must characterize as being in strife\r\nwith the Union between the Kingdoms as confirmed by the Act of Union\r\n\r\nIt has been My constant endeavour to give Norway that position within the\r\nUnion to which it has a just claim. My Royal duty has forced Me, even in\r\nconflict with general opinion in Norway, to try to maintain the legal\r\nprinciples of the Union.\r\n\r\nMy coronation oath and the good of the United Kingdoms prompted My Decree\r\nconcerning the settlement of the Consular question, but in this I have\r\nbeen met, not only by the Norwegian Cabinet's refusal of\r\nCountersignature, but also the resignation of its members. When I\r\ndeclared, »As it is clear to Me, that no other government can now be\r\nformed therefore I cannot consent to the resignation of the Cabinet», the\r\nCabinet answered by the threat that the Norwegian who assented to My\r\nDecree would in the same moment lose all national rights. I was therefore\r\nplaced in such a situation that I must either break the oaths I took\r\nunder the Act of Union, or expose Myself to being without Ministers. I\r\nhad no choice. After having in conflict with the fundamental law, tried\r\nto undo the King's lawfully made resolution, the Council, by resigning\r\ntheir office at the Storthing, have left the King without advisers. The\r\nStorthing has approved of this breaking of the law, and by a\r\nRevolutionary proceeding declared that the lawful King of Norway has\r\nceased to reign, and hat the Union between the Kingdoms is dissolved.\r\n\r\nIt now becomes the bounden duty of Sweden and Myself as King of the\r\nUnion to decide whether Norway's attack on the existing Union shall lead\r\nto the legal dissolution of the same.\r\n\r\nMay the opinions of our contemporaries and also those of posterity judge\r\nbetween Me and the People of Norway!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n28.\r\n\r\nThe Norwegian Storthings documentary address to the King. Dated\r\nChristiania June 19th 1905.\r\n\r\n\r\n  To the King's Most Excellent Majesty!\r\n\r\nNorway's Storthing appeals, in all humility, to Your Majesty and through\r\nthe Your Majesty to the Diet and the People of Sweden to be allowed to\r\nexpress the following:\r\n\r\nThat which has now happened in Norway is the necessary results of the\r\nlate events in Union politics, and cannot be undone. And as it is certain\r\nthat the nation does not wish to return to the old conditions of the\r\nUnion, the Storthing considers it impossible to resume negotiations on\r\nthe different constitutional and state-law questions, which in Your\r\nMajesty's address to the President of the Storthing are referred to, in\r\nconnection with the settled decisions, and on which the Storthing and\r\nGovernment have previously fully expressed themselves. The Storthing\r\nfully understands the difficult position of Your Majesty, and has not for\r\na moment doubted that Your Majesty's decree is made with the full\r\nconviction that Your Majesty has considered it to be the right and duty\r\nof Your Majesty.\r\n\r\nBut it is the desire of the Storthing to address an appeal to Your\r\nMajesty, to the Swedish Diet and Nation, to assist in a peaceful\r\narrangement for the dissolution of the Union, in order to secure\r\nrelations of friendship and cooperation between the two peoples of the\r\nPeninsula. From statements made in Sweden, the Storthing finds that the\r\nresolution the Storthing considered it its duty towards the fatherland to\r\nadopt, by declaring the Union between the United Kingdoms to be\r\ndissolved, has, in its form and the manner of carrying it out, been\r\nlooked upon as an insult to Sweden. This has never been our intention.\r\nWhat has now happened and must happen in Norway, was simply done in order\r\nto maintain Norway's constitutional rights. The nation of Norway never\r\nintended an insult to the honour of Sweden.\r\n\r\nYour Majesty having on the 27th May declared it impossible to sanction\r\nthe unanimous decision of the Storthing to establish a separate Norwegian\r\nConsulate, and as no Norwegian Government could be formed by Your\r\nMajesty, the constitutional situation became out of joint, so dislocated\r\nthat the Union could no longer be upheld. The Norwegian Storthing\r\ntherefore found the position untenable and was forced to get a new\r\ngovernment for the country. Every other resource was excluded, so much\r\nthe more so as the Swedish government of Majesty had already in April\r\n23:rd emphatically refused fresh negotiations, he alternative of which\r\nwas the dissolution of the Union, if new regulations for the continuance\r\nof the Union could not be arranged.\r\n\r\nThe Storthing has already, before hand, stated that the Norwegian people\r\ndo not entertain any feelings of bitterness or ill-will towards Your\r\nMajesty and the people of Sweden. Expressions to the contrary which may\r\npossibly on different occasions have been heard, have alone been caused\r\non the grounds of the displeasure of Norway at her position in the Union.\r\nWhen the cause of this bitterness and ill-will on account of the\r\ndissolution of the Union has been removed, its effects will also\r\ndisappear. A ninety years' cooperation in material and spiritual culture\r\nhas inspired in the Norwegian people a sincere feeling of friendship and\r\nsympathy for the Swedish people. The consequences will be, that when\r\nNorway no longer stands in a position so insulting to its national sense\r\nof independence, a friendship will be established that will serve to\r\nconfirm and increase the mutual understanding between the two peoples.\r\n\r\nWith the confidence that the Swedish people will also share these\r\nopinions, the Storthing appeals to the authorities of State in Sweden, in\r\nacknowledging the new situation in Norway, and its rights as a Sovereign\r\nState, to consent to the negotiations which are necessary for the final\r\nagreements in connection with the now dissolved Union. The Storthing is\r\nready, on its part, to accede to any fair and reasonable wish, that, in\r\nthis respect, may contribute to the guarantee of self dependence and\r\nintegrity of the two Kingdoms.\r\n\r\nIn a legislative sense the two peoples are hereafter separated. But the\r\nStorthing has a certain conviction that happy and confidential relations\r\nwill arise to the benefit of the interests of both. If the above\r\nstatement can find support, without prejudice and without bitterness, the\r\nStorthing is firmly convinced that what has now happened will be to the\r\nlasting happiness of Europe. On behalf of the welfare of the countries of\r\nthe North, the Storthing addresses this appeal to the people who, by\r\ntheir magnanimity and chivalry, have won such a prominent place in the\r\nranks of Nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's notes\r\n\r\nThere are many typographical and orthographical errors in the original.\r\nThey are listed below. No corrections have been made.\r\n\r\nStorthing is sometimes spelled Storting; the use of apostrophes for\r\npossessives is inconsistent; and a number of words are inconsistently\r\nhyphenated. Neither these nor the frequent neologisms are noted\r\nexplicitly.\r\n\r\n  Title page\r\n    Ph D.\r\n\r\n  Table of Contents\r\n    Consular Negatiations\r\n\r\n  Footnote 2-3\r\n    that it has confered\r\n\r\n  Page 4\r\n    which outworldly represents\r\n\r\n  Footnote 4-1\r\n    the more pernicous\r\n\r\n  Page 5\r\n    political ascendency chauvinistic strongwords\r\n\r\n  Page 7\r\n    They may have complain\r\n    in the Committe of 1898\r\n\r\n  Page 8\r\n    represented in they the in administration\r\n\r\n  Footnote 10-1\r\n    Ministeral Council\r\n\r\n  Page 11\r\n    policy of whech\r\n\r\n  Page 12\r\n    Government Departements\r\n\r\n  Page 16\r\n    by which the Ministery\r\n\r\n  Footnote 18-1\r\n    wherevy it became incumbent\r\n\r\n  Page 21\r\n    January 21et 1902\r\n    an disciplinary\r\n\r\n  Footnote 23-2 is missing a full stop at the end.\r\n\r\n  Page 25\r\n    which decribes\r\n\r\n  Page 27\r\n    Buth it may nevertheless\r\n\r\n  Page 30\r\n    Norwegian gouvernment\r\n\r\n  Page 31\r\n    Swedish governement\r\n\r\n  Page 32, side note\r\n    Mr Bostrom's\r\n\r\n  Page 33, \"Coun\" omitted before \"cil\" at the start of the page\r\n\r\n  Footnote 33-2\r\n    Foreign conntry\r\n\r\n  Page 34\r\n    remedy the deficiences\r\n\r\n  Page 36\r\n    tone is one af decision\r\n\r\n  Footnote 36-2 is missing a full stop at the end.\r\n\r\n  Page 38, side note\r\n    accusations aganist\r\n\r\n  Page 38\r\n    illwill against Sweden\r\n    Formally, therfore,\r\n\r\n  Page 40\r\n    the breaking op\r\n    was prowed by\r\n\r\n  Page 43\r\n    an disciplinary sense\r\n\r\n  Footnote 45-2\r\n    frame this laws\r\n\r\n  Page 46\r\n    are unnessary\r\n\r\n  Page 47\r\n    There is a missing a full stop after \"rouse their passions\"\r\n\r\n  Footnote 47-1\r\n    as questions refering\r\n\r\n  Page 48\r\n    One symtom of this\r\n    the tumultuons confusion\r\n\r\n  Page 50\r\n    disssolution of the Union\r\n    a document adressed\r\n    There is a missing full stop after \"appointed by the Storthing\"\r\n\r\n  Page 51\r\n    Therfore the way\r\n    und Mr LÖVLAND\r\n\r\n  Page 52\r\n    for the establisment\r\n\r\n  Page 53\r\n    cause for displeausure\r\n\r\n  Page 55\r\n    whole of the procedings\r\n\r\n  Page 58 side note\r\n    There is a missing full stop after \"27th May 1905\"\r\n\r\n  Page 59 side note\r\n    27nd May\r\n\r\n  Footnote 60-7\r\n    One reeds, for exemple\r\n    There is an extra full stop after \"logic\"\r\n\r\n  Page 61\r\n    on Extraordinary session\r\n\r\n  Footnote 62-1\r\n    The marker for this footnote is on page 61\r\n\r\n  Page 63\r\n    the contents af\r\n\r\n  Page 64\r\n    An Norway cannot complain\r\n\r\n  Page 65\r\n    been in office. the posts\r\n\r\n  Page 66\r\n    absolutly their own\r\n\r\n  Page 67\r\n    such as they are and--have been\r\n\r\n  Document 1, § 1\r\n    inalinenable realm\r\n\r\n  Document 1, § 30\r\n    his opinon recorded\r\n    proeced against him\r\n\r\n  Document 1, § 31\r\n    ezcepting matters of military command\r\n\r\n  Document 2, § 5\r\n    accompaning the King\r\n\r\n  Footnote 73-1\r\n    These enactsments\r\n\r\n  Document 3\r\n    th seame wording\r\n\r\n  Document 4, I\r\n    the appointement or employment\r\n\r\n  Document 4, III\r\n    make direct inquires\r\n\r\n  Document 5\r\n    should he brought against him\r\n\r\n  Document 6\r\n    the preceeding draft\r\n\r\n  Document 6, 2\r\n    this is the, intention\r\n\r\n  Document 7, § 9\r\n    bound to fullfill\r\n\r\n  Document 7, § 11\r\n    or secretely\r\n\r\n  Document 7, § 16\r\n    immedately be reported\r\n\r\n  Document 8, to § 8\r\n    when. in a matter\r\n\r\n  Document 8, to § 11\r\n    wheteher to the\r\n\r\n  Document 8, to § 16\r\n    Norwegian authonity\r\n\r\n  Document 8\r\n    forms of independecy\r\n    There is a missing full stop after \"viz\"\r\n    There is a missing full stop after \"Sweden and for Norway\"\r\n    (see the Communiqué  (should have upper case S)\r\n\r\n  Document 9\r\n    to guarrantee that the Consuls\r\n    Such a guarrantee cannot\r\n    the abovementioned paragraphs\r\n\r\n  Document 10\r\n    I want therfore\r\n    in persuance of\r\n\r\n  Document 11\r\n    lead to the obobject\r\n    thesituation we are in\r\n\r\n  Document 12\r\n    I have to-day summond you\r\n    an one-sided adherence\r\n    request in persuance of\r\n\r\n  Document 14\r\n    while holding in wiew\r\n\r\n  Document 15\r\n    For the treatement\r\n    the Sovereignity of each country\r\n    Swedish Iustice-Department\r\n\r\n  Document 16\r\n    Justice-Departement\r\n    vith regard to\r\n\r\n  Document 18\r\n    well be able to\r\n    Sovereignity of the country\r\n\r\n  Document 19\r\n    May 30th 1905 (should read May 27th)\r\n    I cannot consent to he resignation\r\n    J.
