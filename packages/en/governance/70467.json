China is of all countries the land of\r\ncontradiction and of paradox. But I think that those who read these\r\nletters will see that though, for obvious reasons, they were written\r\nin a spirit of optimism, there was an undercurrent of feeling that\r\nat any moment things might become very different. For instance, if\r\nthe insurrection in Shantung had not been quelled, and the rebels had\r\nmarched upon Peking, which was undoubtedly part of their programme,\r\nthe tragedy of 1900 might, and probably would, have been anticipated\r\nin 1865. Moreover, although we were riding at anchor in smooth water,\r\nthere were from time to time uncomfortable signs of disturbance below.\r\nI remember how on more than one occasion we were warned that on such\r\nand such a day there would be a massacre of Europeans for the old\r\nreason, the murder of babies whose eyes were used for purposes of\r\nphotography. These stories were put about by intriguing mandarins, who\r\nsucceeded in deceiving even some of the more ignorant of their own\r\nclass. The famous General Tsêng Kwo Fan (father of the Marquis Tsêng,\r\nwho was afterwards minister in London) was talking one day with an\r\nEnglish doctor on the subject of this babies’-eyes fraud, when suddenly\r\nhe said, “It is no use your attempting to deny it, for I have here some\r\nof the dried specimens,” and he pulled out a packet of those gelatine\r\ncapsules which are used for covering castor oil and other nauseous\r\ndrugs! We paid little heed to these warnings, though, as recent events\r\nhave proved, there was perhaps more in them than we supposed. We were\r\nsitting on a volcano, for experience has often shown how swiftly\r\nthis seemingly mild and almost childlike people can be lashed into a\r\nfury like that of the flaming legions of hell. One thing we knew for\r\ncertain. If a rising should take place, we were in a death-trap from\r\nwhich there could be no escape. Those grim and frowning gates once\r\nshut, rescue was impossible, for what could a mere handful of men—in\r\nthose days there were but some seventy or eighty Europeans, all told,\r\nin Peking—avail against the seething mob of enraged devils? When years\r\nafterwards, in 1879, there came the horror of Sir Louis Cavagnari’s\r\nmurder, with all his company, at Cabul, I could but think how much the\r\nposition of the Legations at Peking resembled his.\r\n\r\nIt is the fashion to belaud Japan for the spirit of progress which she\r\nhas shown, at the expense of China, which remains wedded to old ways\r\nand worn-out customs. Much as we may admire the marvellous headway\r\nwhich Japan has made, this is hardly quite fair. It must be remembered\r\nthat Japan has never originated anything. All that she knew, up to the\r\ntime of her first real intercourse with foreigners forty years ago,\r\nshe owed to China. Buddhism, which replaced and in some sort throve\r\nhand-in-hand with the old ancestor worship, the Shintô, reading and\r\nwriting, every art and accomplishment, from music and dancing down to\r\nthe game of football, all filtered through Corea from China to Japan,\r\nand the dates of their advent are solemnly recorded as important facts\r\nin the _O Dai Ichi Ran_. “A Glance at the Generation of the Kings,”\r\nthe native history. Borrowers from the beginning of time, it mattered\r\nlittle to the Japanese whether they borrowed once more or once less,\r\nand so when they saw that if they wished to hold a place among the\r\nnations their only chance was to get rid of ancient Chinese forms\r\nand adopt the civilisation of the West, they did not hesitate—they\r\ntook a leap into the light and left the thirteenth for the nineteenth\r\ncentury. To hear some enthusiasts talk one would almost be led to\r\nbelieve that the Japanese invented the nineteenth century. They found\r\nit ready made to their hand. It was impossible to go through the\r\nintermediate centuries. They had to skip, and they did it with a will.\r\nThe transformation scene was as sudden as it was complete. But it cost\r\nthe Japanese no sacrifice of national pride. What they gave up was none\r\nof their own invention.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese, on the other hand, have an autochthon civilisation of\r\nwhich they are justly proud. Five hundred years before Christ came\r\ninto the world—when the inhabitants of these islands were hopeless\r\nsavages clad in skins, or stained with woad according to the seasons,\r\nif the old stories be true—Confucius was teaching respect for customs\r\nwhich were already ancient. Since his day there have been thirteen\r\nchanges of capital and no fewer than thirty dynasties, but even when\r\nTartar[1] emperors have sat upon the Dragon Throne they have been\r\ncompelled to follow the rules of the Chinese, and civilisation has\r\nremained what it was “under the shadow” of the great Teacher. No wonder\r\nthat the son of Han thinks a good many times before he will scatter his\r\npast to the four winds of heaven, as the Japanese did without a sigh!\r\n\r\nIn one sense the mandarins have been wiser in their generation than\r\nthe men who made the Japanese revolution of 1868. These were the\r\ndaimios, such men as Satsuma, Tosa, Choshiu, and their karôs (elders\r\nor councillors), who thinking to overthrow the Tycoon and his rule,\r\nwere blind to the fact that in so doing they were working their own\r\ndownfall as well as his. For they, no less than he, were the embodiment\r\nof the feudal system. Where are they now? _Où sont les neiges d’antan?_\r\nThey have vanished, and their places are filled by a mushroom growth of\r\ndukes, marquises, counts, viscounts, and barons. For Japan has stopped\r\nshort at nothing; not content with adopting the cocked hat, which as we\r\nall know is the very marrow of all good government, giving the _entrée_\r\nto the comity of nations, she has actually invented a full and complete\r\npeerage. Far more astute is the mandarin. Such wily anachronisms as\r\nLi Hung Chang and his compeers know full well that under the sun of\r\nWestern civilisation they must melt away, and it is no matter for\r\nsurprise that they die hard. All the myriads of officials, from the\r\nhighest to the lowest, swarming like ants over that vast empire, are\r\nalive to the fact that their very existence depends on keeping up a\r\nconstant animosity against the Hung Kwei Tzŭ, the red devils. That has\r\nalways appeared to me as the keynote of the situation.\r\n\r\nVarious causes are commonly assigned for the fanaticism against\r\nforeigners, which has from time to time broken out with fatal\r\nconsequences in different parts of China. Some blame missionary\r\nenterprise; some commerce in general; others the opium trade in\r\nparticular. My belief is that it is due to neither of these in itself,\r\nbut to the dread of reform which haunts the official mind, and which in\r\nthe end must win its way.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese are not by nature a people of strong religious convictions,\r\nnor have they any strong religious antipathies. If it were otherwise,\r\nhow is it that a colony of Jews[2] has dwelt among them unmolested\r\nfor two thousand years, and still remains, dwindling in numbers, it\r\nis true, at Kai Fêng in the province of Ho Nan? How is it that the\r\nMohammedans have flourished exceedingly in certain provinces, even to\r\nbecoming a danger to the empire? On the walls of the Imperial palace at\r\nPeking there is a pavilion richly decorated with Arabic inscriptions\r\nfrom the Koran in honour of a Mohammedan lady who was a wife, or\r\nfavourite, of one of the emperors. This does not look like persecution\r\nfor religion’s sake. And, more than these, Buddhism? Ever since the\r\nEmperor Ming Ti dreamt a dream, nearly nineteen centuries ago, and sent\r\nfor Buddhist books and images to China, Buddhism has been the popular\r\nreligion, as Confucianism is the popular school of moral philosophy.\r\nTao-ism, the native religion of Lao Tsŭ, cannot hold its own with it.\r\nTroublous days, indeed, it has gone through at various times, but it\r\nhas outlived them, and now, to quote Dr. Morrison, “Buddhism in China\r\nis decried by the learned, laughed at by the profligate, yet followed\r\nby all.” (See further Wells Williams, _ut suprà_.)\r\n\r\nWhy, then, this tolerance in certain cases, side by side with the\r\ncruellest intolerance where Christianity is concerned? If it is not\r\nreligious conviction, it must be political antipathy. And there is the\r\nrub. The bitter hatred of Christianity is not inborn in the people,\r\nwho have in many instances, indeed, shown a sort of limp willingness,\r\nnot altogether unconnected with better wages, to embrace its tenets;\r\nbut the hostility is bred, fostered, and fomented by the mandarins to\r\nwhom it means the end of their rule. Under a Christian dispensation\r\nthe whole tottering fabric of their power must inevitably fall to\r\nthe ground. The poor Jews were to them a negligible quantity. The\r\nMohammedan creed, the sacred book of which may not be translated,\r\npresents for that reason but small terrors to the lettered class,\r\nthough we hear of an old prophecy to the effect that there will be a\r\ngreat Mohammedan revolution, and that a Hui-Hui (Mohammedan) dynasty\r\nshall rule over China. Buddhism, on the other hand, except in Tibet,\r\naims at no temporal power, and even there the Chinese Emperor is the\r\nSuzerain. But Christianity is a very real terror, to be put down at\r\nany cost, however bloody. And yet, strange to say, there was a time\r\nwhen it seemed as if it were destined to conquer everything and to\r\nbecome the state religion. Internal dissensions and ambitions amongst\r\nits sects alone stopped its course.\r\n\r\nThe history of the early missions to China is full of interest; it is\r\nnot possible, however, to do more than glance at it here. Putting on\r\none side the dim legend that St. Thomas, the doubting apostle, was\r\nthe first to preach the Gospel to the Chinese, there is no doubt that\r\nmissionaries did visit them in very remote ages. It was two Nestorian\r\nmonks who carried the first Eastern silkworms’ eggs to Justinian in\r\nthe sixth century (see my _Bamboo Garden_, pp. 31–33). It is strange\r\nat the present time to read how at the end of the thirteenth century\r\nJohn of Monte Corvino was sent by Pope Nicholas the Fourth to the\r\ncourt of Kublai Khan at Kambaluk (the ancient name of Peking); how he\r\nwas kindly entreated there, building a church “which had a steeple\r\nand belfry, with three bells that were rung every hour to summon the\r\nnew converts to prayer”; how he baptized nearly six thousand persons\r\nduring that time, “and bought one hundred and fifty children, whom he\r\ninstructed in Greek and Latin, composing for them several devotional\r\nbooks.” Clement the Fifth made him an archbishop, and sent him seven\r\nsuffragan bishops. He died full of years in 1328, “having converted\r\nmore than thirty thousand infidels.” All Kambaluk is said to have\r\nmourned for him, Christians and heathen rending their garments at\r\nhis funeral, and his tomb became the resort of pious pilgrims. This\r\naccount, which will be found given at length in the third volume of the\r\n_Chinese Repository_, is probably not a little exaggerated; but even\r\ndiscounting it largely, it is very striking as an evidence of devotion\r\non the one side and toleration on the other. “It is now twelve years,”\r\nhe wrote, “since I have heard any news of the west. I am become old\r\nand gray-headed, but it is rather through labours and tribulations\r\nthan through age, for I am only fifty-eight years old. I have learned\r\nthe Tartar language and literature, into which I have translated the\r\nwhole New Testament and the Psalms of David, and have caused them to\r\nbe transcribed with the utmost care. I write and read and preach openly\r\nand freely the testimony of the law of God.” Until the year 1368, when\r\nthe Yuan or Tartar dynasty was driven out by the Chinese, and the Ming\r\nEmperors ruled first at Nanking and afterwards at Peking, Dr. Williams\r\nsays “there is no reasonable doubt that the greater part of Central\r\nAsia and Northern China was the scene of many flourishing Christian\r\ncommunities.” From that time forth, during upwards of two hundred\r\nyears, they dwindled away so that nothing more was heard of them.\r\n\r\nIt was at the end of the sixteenth century that the Jesuits first began\r\nto exercise an influence which was very nearly overwhelming all rivalry\r\nin China. Saint François Xavier, the gospeller of India and Japan, had\r\nmarked China as the special field of his future labours, but he died of\r\nfever at the island of Shang Chuen, near Macao, being only forty-six\r\nyears old at the time of his death—a wonderful man, truly! But his work\r\nwas destined to fall into hands no less competent for the task than\r\nhis own.\r\n\r\nMatteo Ricci, the famous Jesuit father, was born at Macerata, in the\r\nPapal States, in 1552. At the age of nineteen he was sent to Rome to\r\nstudy law, which career he quickly abandoned, to his father’s great\r\ndispleasure, to enter the Society of Jesus. Here he came under the\r\norders of Father Valignani, the Inspector-General of Eastern Missions,\r\nwith whom, before he had even finished his noviciate, he went to\r\nIndia, continuing his studies at Goa, where he became professor of\r\nphilosophy. In 1580 he followed Father Ruggiero to Macao, where the\r\ntwo priests gave themselves up to the study of the Chinese language.\r\nThey availed themselves of the trading privileges of the Portuguese\r\nto visit Canton, and some two years later, not without encountering\r\nsome difficulties and disappointments, they obtained the permission\r\nof the Viceroy of Kwang Tung to build a house at Shao Ching Fu, and\r\na church. Ricci soon saw that a reputation for learning was then,\r\nas now, the only passport to high consideration among the lettered\r\nclasses. He published a map of China and a catechism, in which he set\r\nforth the moral teaching of Christianity, excluding carefully all that\r\npertains to the doctrines of revealed religion. He had his reward,\r\nfor many learned men came to consult him, and his fame spread far\r\nand wide. For some years the Jesuit fathers adopted the garments of\r\nBuddhist priests, but finding that these were treated with anything\r\nbut respect, they, upon the advice of Father Valignani, dropped the\r\nyellow robes and assumed the garb of the men of letters, whom above all\r\nit was their wise endeavour to conciliate. Ricci paid three visits to\r\nNanking, but on the second occasion he was expelled, and forced to go\r\nto Nanchang, where he established a school and published two treatises,\r\nthe _Art of Memory_ and a _Dialogue on Friendship_. This last work was\r\na marvellous success, for it became famous not only “for the loftiness\r\nof its thoughts, but even for the purity of its style,” a feat perhaps\r\nunique in a country where literary style is so much thought of, and\r\nso difficult to attain, even by native scholars. In the year 1600 he\r\nachieved his ambition of going to Peking charged with presents for the\r\nEmperor Wan Li from the Portuguese at Macao. But the mission was not\r\naccomplished without difficulty. A eunuch of the court had offered\r\nhimself as his escort, and with him Ricci set out in a native junk. But\r\nthe presents of which he was the bearer had aroused the cupidity of the\r\neunuch, who contrived to imprison Ricci and his companion Pantoja at\r\nTientsing for six months. Happily the affair came to the ears of the\r\nEmperor, who ordered him to be released and brought to Peking, where\r\nhe was kindly received by Wan Li, who assigned him a house and salary.\r\nRicci soon made many friends and converts, of whom one named Sü helped\r\nhim in the translation of Euclid. His secret of success was being all\r\nthings to all men, and he contrived so to edit Christianity as to make\r\nit fit in with existing manners and customs, and to give offence to\r\nnone. Among other things he allowed the rites of ancestral worship to\r\nbe continued, affecting to consider them as being of a civil and not\r\nof a religious character. In short, he followed the Buddhist system\r\nof incorporating, not condemning, those articles of native faith to\r\nhave fought against which would have been fatal to his schemes. Father\r\nRicci died in 1610, being fifty-eight years of age. If, on account of\r\nthe laxity of his theological concessions, he cannot be called a great\r\nChristian missionary, he was at any rate a great conciliator, and it\r\nwas no fault of his that the seed which he successfully sowed did not\r\nbring forth good fruit. He was possessed of rare talents, his learning\r\nwas conspicuous in many branches, and his winning charm of manner\r\ncommended him to the favour of high and low. He was perhaps the only\r\nEuropean who ever acquired the Chinese literary style to such a degree\r\nas to call forth the admiration of native critics. To such an extent\r\nwas this recognised, that about 150 years after his death his treatise\r\non _The True Doctrine of God_, revised by a minister of state named\r\nSin, was included in the collection of the best Chinese works made by\r\nthe order of the Emperor Chien Lung.\r\n\r\nTo follow a man so various and so plastic as Ricci was no easy task;\r\nbut the Society of Jesus has never been wanting in men possessed at any\r\nrate of the latter quality, and Father Longobardi proved an efficient\r\nsuccessor, though he did not make history. But there were troubles in\r\nstore for the missionaries. Their successes aroused the jealousies of\r\ncourtiers and officials, whose intrigues led to the publication of\r\nan edict banishing the Christian teachers. This decree, however, was\r\nnever carried into effect. They had made many converts who protected\r\nthem, and foremost among these were Sü (Ricci’s special friend) and\r\nhis daughter, christened under the name of Candida. These two Chinese\r\nconverts were so famous for their virtues and so beloved for their\r\ncharity, that they are actually worshipped to this day by the people\r\nat Shanghai, and the Roman Catholic Mission at Sü Chia Wei, near that\r\ncity, occupies the property once held by the Christian Sü. Candida was\r\nindeed a saintly woman. She built no fewer than thirty-nine churches;\r\nshe published upwards of one hundred books; she established a foundling\r\nhospital for babies whom, then as now, their unnatural parents were\r\nin the habit of abandoning; and she employed the blind improvisatori\r\nof the streets to substitute Gospel stories for their obscenities and\r\ninanities. The Emperor himself conferred upon her the title of “The\r\nVirtuous Woman,” and sent her a robe and headgear embroidered with\r\npearls, which she stripped off to further her religious works with\r\ntheir price.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of the seventeenth century was a time of internal trouble\r\nand revolution in China. The old Chinese dynasty of the Mings was about\r\nto be replaced by the present Tartar dynasty, the Chi̔ng. That the\r\nJesuits had become a real power in the land is proved by the fact that\r\nthe claimant to the Ming throne was supported by the missionaries, his\r\ntroops being led by two native Christian generals, Kiu who was called\r\nThomas, and Chin who was baptized Luke. His mother, wife, and son were\r\nchristened as Helena, Maria, and Constantine, and Helena went so far as\r\nto write to Pope Alexander VII. “expressing her attachment to the cause\r\nof Christianity, and wishing to put the country, through him, under the\r\nprotection of God”! (Wells Williams).\r\n\r\nThe Jesuits held a high position in the early days of the Tartar rule.\r\nThis was due to the pre-eminent abilities of their leader, Johann Adam\r\nSchall, a man of good family, native of Cologne. This great priest\r\nwas born in A.D. 1591, and entered the Society of Jesus at Rome in\r\n1611. There he became a student of theology and mathematics, and left\r\nfor China in 1622. His great learning won for him such renown that\r\nhe was sent for by the Emperor in 1631, installed at Peking as court\r\nastronomer, and charged with the revision of the Chinese calendar.\r\nNeedless to say this position was not won without exciting great\r\njealousy among the native men of science, who attacked him fiercely,\r\nboth openly and in secret. But his correct calculation of an eclipse,\r\nas to which they were hopelessly wrong, defeated all their intrigues,\r\nand he was more than ever in favour with the Emperor Chung Ch’êng\r\n(the last of the Mings), who, in dread of the Tartars, caused him,\r\nmuch against his will, to start a cannon foundry, rewarding him with\r\na pompous autograph inscription in praise of his science and virtue.\r\nWhen at last the Tartars became masters of Peking, Schall, though in\r\ncontinual danger himself, was able to give effectual protection to the\r\nChristian converts. It cannot fail to strike us with amazement that,\r\nlike the Vicar of Bray, when matters settled down, Schall should have\r\nenjoyed even more favour under the Tartar Emperor Shun Chih than he had\r\ndone under his Ming predecessor; and when, at that sovereign’s death in\r\n1662, he actually was holding the post of tutor to the young Emperor\r\nKáng Hsi, who became one of the most famous monarchs that ever ruled\r\nin China, it seemed as if nothing could arrest the progress of Jesuit\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nBut the supreme power was for a time in the hands of four regents\r\nwho were opposed to the Christians, and a memorial was presented\r\nto court denouncing the new sect as dangerous to the state. The\r\nDominicans and Franciscans, of whom I shall speak presently, had,\r\nduring a quarter of a century and more, been working in opposition\r\nto the Jesuits, and the internal dissensions of the sects gave their\r\nenemies an opportunity of which they were not slow to avail themselves.\r\nThe memorial, a remarkable document, calls attention to the strife\r\nbetween the orders as to the worship of Ti̔en (Heaven) and Shang Ti\r\n(God), which dissensions as to the principle of doctrine show the\r\ntrue aspirations of the rival sects to be political; and in this\r\nconnection the memorialists call attention to the schisms and civil war\r\nto which Christianity gave rise in Japan, evils which could not fail\r\nto occur sooner or later in China if the missionaries were allowed to\r\nremain there. The regents, nothing loth, yielded to the wishes of the\r\nmemorialists, and in 1665 the Christian teachers were proscribed as\r\nseducers of the people, leading them into a false path. Father Schall\r\ndied miserably at the age of seventy-eight, after having been for\r\nthirty-seven years the trusted and favoured servant of five emperors.\r\nHis converts were degraded, and his colleagues imprisoned or banished.\r\n\r\nAmong those who were held in chains, beaten, and subjected to every\r\nindignity, was Father Verbiest, a native of Flanders, partly educated\r\nat Seville, the third of the great triad of priests who, by their\r\ntalents, their learning, and their personal charm, so nearly succeeded\r\nin turning the current of Chinese history. For six long years who\r\nshall say what he suffered? Six years of the horrors of a Chinese\r\nprison! At last, however, the minority of the Emperor Ka̔ng Hsi came\r\nto an end. He had not forgotten the good teaching of Father Schall,\r\nand one of his earliest acts, on assuming the power in 1671, was to\r\nrelease the priests, with Father Verbiest at their head. Ka̔ng Hsi was\r\nnot a Christian; but though he forbade his subjects to follow the new\r\nteaching, he was sufficiently liberal to put an end to persecution, and\r\nto recognise the value of Western learning. There is a myth to the\r\neffect that an earthquake was the immediate cause of the release, but\r\nthe truth is that the Emperor wanted Verbiest’s astronomical science\r\nto set straight the crooked inventions of the native professors. The\r\nfather was appointed court astronomer and chief mathematician. He was\r\nalso ordered, as Schall had been, to cast cannon, which, with much\r\npomp and ceremony, robed as for mass, he blessed, in the presence of\r\nthe court, sprinkling them with holy water, and giving to each the\r\nname of a female saint which he had himself drawn on the breech. This\r\nbrought him a letter from Pope Innocent XI., praising him for having\r\nso wisely brought the profane sciences into play for the salvation of\r\nChinese souls. To Father Verbiest are due the wonderful mathematical\r\ninstruments of bronze, beautiful as works of art, which are still one\r\nof the sights of Peking. They are in the Observatory at the southern\r\ncorner of the Tartar city, where they remain as the last witnesses of\r\nthe Jesuit greatness. Verbiest died in 1688, and the Emperor himself\r\ncomposed the funeral oration, which was read with great pomp before\r\nhis coffin. No three men ever succeeded in obtaining the favour of\r\nthe Chinese court so signally as the three Jesuit fathers, Ricci,\r\nSchall, and Verbiest. When Father Verbiest died there was no man with\r\na sufficiently commanding intellect to fill his place and continue his\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nIt is conceivable that if they had not been thwarted by the Dominicans\r\nand the Franciscans, the Jesuits might have succeeded in their\r\nambition even to the extent of Christianising China. But those two\r\nsects effectually put a stop to the process of conversion. The great\r\nbone of contention was the so-called worship of ancestors and of\r\nConfucius. Another point was the translation of the name of God by\r\nTi̔en, literally Heaven, and Shang Ti, for which there is indeed no\r\nother rendering. This last controversy, which has in it much that is\r\nchildish, and mere splitting of hairs, is not worth discussing. The\r\ngreat point was to render the Sacred Name by some term that should\r\nbe intelligible to the Chinese mind. Both seemed to fulfil that\r\ncondition. As regards the former question, we have seen how Father\r\nRicci dealt with it. He saw the wisdom of not repelling the Chinese\r\nby at once condemning a custom to which they were so wedded that any\r\nattempt to do away with it would evidently alienate them altogether,\r\nso he, a true Jesuit, effected a clever compromise, treating the rites\r\nin honour of ancestors and of Confucius as civil and not as religious\r\nceremonies. It always has seemed to me that he acted wisely, for in no\r\nother way could he have hoped to obtain any hearing. By degrees the\r\nChristianised Chinese might have been weaned from their old practices,\r\nand Christianity in all its purity have been made a dominant religion.\r\nThis, however, is mere speculation.\r\n\r\nWhen the Dominicans and Franciscans became aware of the successes of\r\nthe Jesuits, they too resolved to have their share in the work, and\r\nthey promptly sent out missions to China on their own account. But\r\ntheir school lacked the liberality and plastic nature of the Jesuits.\r\nThey resolutely refused any compromise. They accused the Jesuits\r\nof countenancing idolatry and heathen practices, and one Morales, a\r\nSpanish Dominican, sent home a report to the Propaganda to that effect.\r\nThis produced a decree from Pope Innocent the Tenth, in which the\r\nconduct of the Jesuits was censured and their doctrine condemned in\r\n1645. It took the Jesuits eleven years to procure from Pope Alexander\r\nVII. another Bull, not indeed contradicting that of Pope Innocent, but\r\none which might be so read as to give them a free hand. But the battle\r\nwas not over, for in 1693 Bishop Maigrot, Vicar Apostolic in China,\r\ndeclared in the face of the Inquisition and the Pope that Ti̔en meant\r\nthe material heaven, and not God, and that the worship of ancestors was\r\nidolatrous. In this difficulty it is not a little strange to find that\r\nthe Jesuits appealed to the Emperor Ka̔ng Hsi to show them the way out.\r\nThey addressed him in a memorial which is quoted at length by Wells\r\nWilliams from the _Life of St. Martin_, and which is so curious that I\r\nam tempted to transcribe it, the more so as it shows so clearly all\r\nthe points of the great controversy:—\r\n\r\n“We, your faithful subjects, although originally from distant\r\ncountries, respectfully supplicate your Majesty to give us clear\r\ninstructions on the following points. The scholars of Europe have\r\nunderstood that the Chinese practise certain ceremonies in honour\r\nof Confucius; that they offer sacrifices to Heaven, and that they\r\nobserve peculiar rites towards their ancestors; but persuaded that\r\nthese ceremonies, sacrifices, and rites are founded in reason, though\r\nignorant of their true intention, earnestly desire us to inform them.\r\nWe have always supposed that Confucius was honoured in China as a\r\nlegislator, and that it was in this character alone, and with this view\r\nsolely, that the ceremonies established in his honour were practised.\r\nWe believe that the rites in honour of ancestors are only observed in\r\norder to exhibit the love felt for them, and to hallow the remembrance\r\nof the good received from them during their life. We believe that\r\nthe sacrifices offered to Heaven are not tendered to the visible\r\nheavens which are seen above us, but to the Supreme Master, Author,\r\nand Preserver of heaven and earth, and of all they contain. Such are\r\nthe interpretation and the sense which we have always given to these\r\nChinese ceremonies; but as strangers cannot be considered competent\r\nto pronounce on these important points with the same certainty as the\r\nChinese themselves, we presume to request your Majesty not to refuse to\r\ngive us the explanations which we desire concerning them. We wait for\r\nthem with respect and submission.”\r\n\r\nKa̔ng Hsi cut the Gordian knot by declaring that “Ti̔en means the true\r\nGod, and that the customs of China are political.” In spite of this\r\nImperial opinion Pope Clement XI. upheld Bishop Maigrot, declared that\r\nTi̔en Chu, Lord of Heaven, must be the name for God, Ti̔en and Shang Ti\r\nbeing altogether inadmissible.\r\n\r\nTournon, Patriarch of Antioch, was sent to Peking, where at an audience\r\nof Ka̔ng Hsi the Emperor demanded to be informed of the decision of\r\nthe Pope. When Ka̔ng Hsi learnt that a Pope of Rome had ventured to\r\ngive an opinion contrary to his own in a matter which was altogether\r\nChinese, and in part purely linguistic, he was furious, and issued\r\na decree declaring that the Jesuits should be protected, but the\r\nfollowers of Bishop Maigrot should be persecuted. The Patriarch Tournon\r\nwas banished to Macao, where further difficulties arose between him\r\nand the bishop of that diocese, who went so far as to imprison the\r\nlegate in a private house, where he died. A second legate was sent to\r\nPeking in 1715 in the person of one Mezzabarba. Ka̔ng Hsi received\r\nhim civilly, but would not talk about rites, and after six years\r\nfruitlessly spent he returned to Europe.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the eighteenth century it is claimed that there\r\nwere in the provinces of the two Chiangs alone one hundred churches\r\nand a hundred thousand Christians. Those were the palmy days of\r\nmissionary enterprise, but they did not last long. The quarrels of the\r\nmissionaries amongst themselves, their political ambitions, which it\r\nwas represented constituted a danger to the state, disgusted Ka̔ng Hsi.\r\nThe Jesuits, indeed, he continued to tolerate, forbidding any priests\r\nbut those who would follow the rules of Ricci to remain in China. In\r\n1723 Ka̔ng Hsi died, and was succeeded by his son Yung Chêng, who in\r\nthe following year issued an edict strictly forbidding the propagation\r\nof the Christian religion. A few missionaries were retained at Peking\r\non account of their scientific acquirements, but the majority were\r\nbanished to the south. The native Christians in the north were left\r\nas a flock without shepherds; they were subjected to extortion and\r\nblackmailing of the worst description, and although many remained\r\nfaithful and even contrived to harbour their teachers secretly, this\r\nedict of Yung Chêng gave the death-blow to an energy which had made\r\nitself powerfully felt for a century and a quarter.\r\n\r\nI have been led further afield than I intended in this sketch of the\r\nJesuit enterprise (based mainly upon Dr. Wells Williams’s book and on\r\nthe _Biographie Universelle_), but it is a fascinating subject, and\r\nfew people outside of those personally interested in China know how\r\nnearly at one time the Christian religion seemed to be reaching a great\r\ntriumph. The story of Ricci, Schall, and Verbiest teaches one great\r\ntruth. If missionaries are to be successful it must be by the power of\r\nmasterly talent and knowledge. They can only work on any scale through\r\nthe lettered class, and in order to dominate them must be able to give\r\nproof of superior attainments as the old Jesuits did. With courage,\r\ndevotion, self-sacrifice, our missionaries are largely endowed. They\r\nhave given proofs of these, even to the laying down of their lives; but\r\nthese qualities are as nothing in the eyes of the cultivated Confucian.\r\nOne such convert as Schall’s friend Sü and his daughter Candida would\r\ndo more towards Christianising China than thousands of poor peasants.\r\nTo make such a convert needs qualifications which are rare indeed.\r\nAbove all things an accurate and scholarly knowledge of the language\r\nis necessary. There have been not a few excellent scholars among our\r\nmissionaries. But there are many more whose ignorance in that respect\r\nhas been fatal, covering themselves and the religion which they\r\npreach with ridicule. Fancy a Chinese Buddhist mounting on the roof\r\nof a hansom cab at Charing Cross and preaching Buddhism to the mob in\r\npidgin English! That would give some measure of the effect produced\r\non a Chinese crowd by a missionary whom I have seen perched upon a\r\ncart outside the great gate of the Tartar City at Peking, haranguing\r\na yellow crowd of gapers in bastard Chinese, delivered with a strong\r\nAberdonian accent. The Jesuits knew better than that.\r\n\r\nNot an uncommon argument in support of the truths of Christianity is to\r\ncall attention to the purity of the lives of the missionaries. I find\r\na note of a conversation on this subject in my Journals. “Venerable\r\nsir,” answered the learned and respectable Kung, “the goodness of a\r\ndumpling does not depend upon the pucker at the top of it. You can no\r\nmore judge a man’s merits by his outward seeming than you can mete out\r\nthe sea in a bushel measure. It is true that to all appearance your\r\nmissionaries lead very pure lives; but to all appearance so do our\r\npeople. Look at Mr. Li and Mr. Pao, who live in my street. Nothing can\r\nbe more respectable than their outward demeanour, yet we know perfectly\r\nwell that Mr. Li sleeps in flowers and closes his eyes in willows” (a\r\nmetaphorical expression for leading a dissolute life), “while as for\r\nMr. Pao, the less said about him the better. What guarantee have I that\r\nthese men, whose excellence you extol, are not like my neighbours Li\r\nand Pao? Since I must doubt even that which passes before my eyes, how\r\ncan I believe that which comes to me only by hearsay? The proverb says,\r\n‘If your front teeth are knocked out, swallow them.’ Nobody publishes\r\nhis own misfortune or his own disgrace.”\r\n\r\nThe Chinaman knew his own country well. Virtue without the supremest\r\npower of science and education is not enough to carry conviction to the\r\nman of letters.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, the history of the great Jesuit movement proves my\r\npoint that the spirit of religious intolerance is not a fault which\r\ncan fairly be laid to the charge of “The Hundred Names,” as the οἱ\r\nπολλοί of China call themselves, and that where it has shown itself\r\nit has been engendered and fostered by the fears of the officials. It\r\nis the same with trade. The rulers and not the ruled are the authors\r\nof all difficulties. The Chinaman is a born trader. Buying, selling,\r\nand barter are the very joy of his life, and so long as he can get the\r\nbetter of a bargain what cares he with whom he deals? Foreigner or\r\nfellow-countryman, it is all one to him.\r\n\r\nThe third source to which hatred of foreigners is ascribed is opium.\r\nThat has been dealt with so recently by a Royal Commission that there\r\nis nothing new to be said upon the subject. All I can say, speaking\r\nfrom personal observation, is that I have known some hundreds of\r\nChinese of all classes who were opium smokers. None of them abused\r\nthe drug. They regarded it as a most valuable prophylactic against\r\nfever and ague, and would have been very loth to do without it. Some\r\nwere literary men and officials doing hard brainwork; others, like a\r\ntravelling pedlar whom I met on one of my Mongolian excursions, were\r\ndoing equally hard bodily work. The abuse of opium has, so far as I\r\ncan judge, been grossly exaggerated. It cannot be denied that there\r\nare to be seen in the opium dens of great cities a few poor wretches\r\nwho have reduced themselves to a state of abject degradation by their\r\nintemperance; but their percentage must be small indeed compared\r\nto that of the victims of alcohol who are the disgrace of our own\r\ntowns, and at any rate, as has been cunningly observed, they do not\r\ngo home and beat their wives. To deprive the Chinaman of the finest\r\nqualities of Indian opium would be to condemn him to the use of the\r\nmiserable substitute which he grows in his own fields. It would be\r\nlike forbidding the importation of champagne and Château Lafitte into\r\nEngland, and driving our epicures and invalids to the necessity of\r\nfalling back upon cheap and nasty stimulants. If the opium trade were\r\nto be abolished to-morrow it is my firm conviction that it would\r\nspring up again immediately, but under altered conditions and in\r\nnative hands. If it be thought that I am wrong in what I say as to\r\nthe use of opium, read what Dr. Morrison says in his delightful book,\r\n_An Australian in China_. There you have the independent testimony of\r\na competent physician who has travelled over the whole of China from\r\neast to west, and who has dealt exhaustively with the question. No one\r\nhas had better opportunities of judging. No opinion is worthy of more\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nMy conclusion then is that neither the religion of the missionaries,\r\nnor the trade of the merchants, nor even the much-abused drug, can\r\nhonestly be counted as the cause of the anti-foreign movement in\r\nChina, though one and all have been used as levers to envenom it.\r\nForeign intercourse in any shape is the bugbear of the mandarin, as\r\nbeing the one standing danger threatening abolition of himself and\r\nhis privileges, of which the two most dearly prized are robbery and\r\ncruelty.\r\n\r\nLet us be just, however, even to the mandarin. It often happens that\r\nthe missionaries are surrounded by natives of bad character, who hang\r\non to them for protection. Especially is this the case with certain\r\nRoman Catholics, who have always endeavoured to “extra-territorialise”\r\ntheir converts, that is, to exact for them the same privileges of\r\nimmunity from Chinese jurisdiction as are granted to the subjects of\r\ntheir own country. It is easy to see how this may give just cause of\r\noffence to the officials, and how readily a cunning malefactor will\r\nrun to his priest to shelter his back from the bamboo rod, swearing\r\nthat the charge brought against him is a mere pretext, his profession\r\nof the Christian faith, in which he is protected by treaty, being the\r\nreal offence. Full of righteous indignation and confidence in the truth\r\nof his convert, who, being a Christian, must necessarily be believed\r\nbefore his heathen accuser, the priest rushes off to the magistrate’s\r\noffice to plead the cause of his protégé. The magistrate finds the\r\nman guilty and punishes him; the priest is stout in his defence; a\r\ndiplomatic correspondence ensues, and on both sides the vials of wrath\r\nare poured out. How can a priest who interferes, and the mandarin who\r\nis interfered with, love one another? Some instances there have been\r\nwhere the priests have gone a step farther, and have actually urged\r\ntheir disciples to own no allegiance to their native authorities, but\r\nto obey only themselves as representatives of the Sovereign Pontiff of\r\nRome.\r\n\r\nThe missionaries, on the other hand, of the China Inland Mission put\r\nforth no such pretensions, and excite no such animosities.\r\n\r\nThe jealousies of the different sects of Christianity among themselves\r\nthrow as great difficulties in the way of conversion to-day as they did\r\nin Ka̔ng Hsi’s time. A highly-educated Chinese gentleman, who had been\r\nmaking inquiries into the doctrines of Christianity, once appealed to\r\nme on the subject. “How is it,” he asked, “that if I go to one teacher\r\nand talk to him of what I have learnt from another he answers me, ‘No,\r\nthat is not right; that is the doctrine preached by So-and-So; if you\r\nfollow him you will go to hell’?” But that one missionary should speak\r\nof the Church of another Christian as a “Scarlet Woman” appeared to him\r\nto be altogether lacking in decorum. It must be a puzzle—yet not worse\r\nthan the various schools of Buddhism.\r\n\r\nIt used to be a cardinal article of faith among Europeans in China\r\nduring the fifties, that if once we could throw Peking open to foreign\r\ndiplomacy all would be well. That was to be the sovereign cure for\r\nall the ills of which we had to complain. We should be in touch with\r\nthe Emperor and his court, and we could not fail to convert the most\r\nrecalcitrant of mandarins to the adoption of our Western civilisation:\r\nperhaps even China might become a Christian country. We have now been\r\nat Peking for forty years, during which time successive ministers of\r\nall countries have preached, flattered, scolded, and threatened over\r\nthe sweetmeats and tea of the Tsung-Li Yamên, and what is the result\r\nto-day?\r\n\r\nWhat really was wanted was not to get into Peking ourselves, but to\r\nget the Emperor with his court and Government out of it. This is no\r\nnew theory of mine. So confident have I always been that Peking is the\r\nworst capital on all grounds for China, that thirty years ago, writing\r\nin _Macmillan’s Magazine_ of the Tientsing massacre in 1870, I said,\r\n“This time we hope that the past will be a lesson for the future, and\r\nthat such conditions will be imposed as will secure our countrymen,\r\nbe they laymen or missionaries, from outrage, and will prevent China\r\nfrom remaining the one bar to the progress and civilisation of the\r\nworld. It is not within the province of a magazine article to suggest\r\nwhat those conditions should be; but we cannot help hinting that if\r\nthe treaty powers were to treat China as Peter the Great did Russia,\r\nand transplant the capital and court from Peking back to Nanking,\r\nwhence it was removed by the Emperor Tai Tsung, who reigned under\r\nthe style of Yung Lo at the beginning of the fifteenth century, the\r\nheadquarters of obstructiveness and mandarinism would be destroyed,\r\nthe power of the viceroys would be brought under the control of the\r\ncentral Government, and a new era might be inaugurated which should\r\nbe as conducive to the welfare and happiness of the Chinese people\r\nas to the safety and profits of the European trader. Above all, the\r\nrepresentatives of European powers, instead of being boxed up in Peking\r\nlike rats in a trap, would in the not improbable event of their having\r\nfrom time to time certain demands and requisitions to make of the\r\nChinese Government, be backed up by the presence of their men of war\r\non the spot. It is wonderful how distance weakens a threat, and how\r\nwholesomely the sight of power acts upon the Oriental mind.”\r\n\r\nSubsequent events have not led me to alter an opinion formed so many\r\nyears ago. So long as Peking remains the capital so long will it be\r\nimpossible to bring home to the Government certain facts which are\r\nwell known to many of the provincial governors, but which only in rare\r\ninstances they dare to report to headquarters. It is not conceivable\r\nthat, if the Empress Tsŭ Hsi had known what a hornet’s nest she was\r\nstirring, she would have acted as she must have done in encouraging\r\nPrince Tuan and the Boxers. But it is a far cry to Peking.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be said that the policy of foreign governments in China\r\nhas been calculated to raise the powers in the estimate of those\r\nvery Chinese whom it ought to be our chief duty to impress. Take the\r\noutrages upon missionaries and the constant murders of which we have\r\nhad to complain—until the German Emperor seized Kwei Chao we have\r\nalways been content to accept a money indemnity as reparation; so\r\nthat the local mandarins must have looked upon the death of a few\r\nmissionaries—the most sweet-smelling offering that could be made to\r\nTsŭ Hsi and her eunuchs—as a mere question of cost, and that moreover\r\nnot to be defrayed by themselves, but squeezed out of the people. If\r\nsome poor wretch or wretches were decapitated, the instigator, the real\r\nculprit, could enjoy the luxury of sitting in judgment over his own\r\ncrime, and sentencing to death some victim caught at random out of the\r\nprisons, or perhaps even—for Chinese methods are ingenious—paying off\r\nan old score.\r\n\r\nAs regards intercourse with the ruling classes, or obtaining\r\nany influence with the court, our presence at Peking has been\r\nuseless—perhaps worse than useless, actually mischievous. For what can\r\na Chinese gentleman think when he sees the filthiest beggar pass freely\r\nwithout let or hindrance in parts of the city where the presence of the\r\nminister of the proudest nation in Europe would be deemed a pollution?\r\nWe have been tolerated in Peking as a necessary evil—accepted we have\r\nnever been. The receptions at court have been so rare, and made such\r\na great favour of, that they have been a mere farce, and in some\r\ncases, such as the visit of the ladies of the _Corps diplomatique_\r\nto the Empress Tsŭ Hsi, a degradation. Compare with the position of\r\nthe British Minister at Peking—stoned and insulted in the streets,\r\nand unable to obtain protection or redress—the reception of Li Hung\r\nChang by all Europe three years ago. How that astute old intriguer\r\nmust have laughed in his sleeve when he found himself petted, coaxed,\r\nand flattered, treated like a royal personage! and what must have been\r\nthe inference drawn by every ignorant Chinese, from Tsŭ Hsi and the\r\npoor down-trampled Emperor Kwang Hsu down to the meanest beggar on the\r\nbridge? Crystal is not so clear as the fact that the Son of Heaven is\r\nthe ruler of the world, and all other monarchs mere vassals, doing\r\nhomage to the steps of the Jasper Throne.\r\n\r\nPeking has exercised upon foreign representatives a sort of unholy\r\nglamour. They have been bewitched. Some have fallen down and worshipped\r\nbefore its scholastic and historical traditions; others have treated\r\nthe great city and its rulers as a sort of gigantic “curio”; optimism\r\nhas been the bane of all. If any serious attempt has been made to bring\r\nthe mandarins into the pale of statesmanship it has been singularly\r\nunsuccessful. They remain as retrograde and as hopelessly obstructive\r\nas ever. They have occasionally been clever enough, like Li, to throw\r\ndust in the eyes of foreigners, and that is all. Unless a radical\r\nchange is effected European diplomacy will continue to be abortive; to\r\neffect that change it is absolutely necessary that the court should be\r\nremoved from the headquarters of obstruction, and brought into actual\r\ncontact with our civilisation and with the material evidence of Western\r\npower. The old-world prejudices of Moscow were a hindrance to Peter the\r\nGreat; the Kugés buried for centuries at Kiyôto were a drag upon the\r\nreformers of Japan; the capitals were moved. These are the two great\r\nprecedents for such a policy.\r\n\r\nIn spite of protesting princes and potentates, it seems as if the\r\npartition of China, that unwieldy monster, was at hand. When the\r\nphrases “Sphere of Influence” and “Hinterland,” diplomatic expressions\r\nrecently invented for the benefit of savage Africa, came, three or four\r\nyears ago, to be applied to China, then nominally a friendly power,\r\nit was not difficult to foresee what must follow. The events of the\r\nlast three months have precipitated matters. Germany is in honour\r\nbound to exact exemplary retribution for the murder of her minister,\r\nthe deadliest insult that could be offered to a great nation. If she\r\nwere minded to take Shantung, where she might establish a flourishing\r\ncolony, she would act as a buffer state between Central China and\r\nRussia, who has already to all intents possessed herself of Manchuria,\r\nand has for many a year cast longing eyes upon Chihli; and after all,\r\nif Russia were to annex Chihli with Peking would the world have any\r\ngreat cause for lamentation? Apart from all other considerations,\r\nRussia with a nucleus of co-religionists in the Albazines, of whom\r\nthere is a short account at p. 211 of these letters, would have more in\r\nhand towards Christianising the people than any other nation or sect;\r\nand it seems to me that Peking Russian, and possibly Christian, would\r\nbe far better than Peking Chinese, and certainly heathen. If further\r\nencroachment were guarded against by Germany in Shantung we should not\r\nbe losers. Should France want a rectification of frontier for her\r\ngreat Asiatic colony—why should we interfere? The restoration of the\r\nold frontier of Burmah and the freedom of the Yangtze region should\r\nsuffice us.\r\n\r\nAs for a change of dynasty in China, which some writers are crying for,\r\nthat is an impossibility, because there is no Chinese pretender ready\r\nto replace the Manchus. It would mean chaos such as the world has never\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nFreed from the incubus of the Empress Tsŭ Hsi and her eunuchs, freed\r\nfrom Prince Tuan and the other bloodguilty Manchus, the Emperor,\r\nsurrounded by a more enlightened court, and acting under capable\r\nadvisers, would be enabled to rule peacefully and honestly over an\r\nimmense and prosperous empire; while the removal of the capital would,\r\nwithout any act of vandalism, such as the suggested destruction of the\r\nTombs, read China that lesson which is so sorely needed, and which\r\nthe absurd reprisals of 1860 utterly failed to convey. After the\r\nsecond occupation of Peking we should not again hear of the Barbarians\r\nbringing tribute to the Son of Heaven from his vassals.\r\n\r\nThe idea of a change of capital is not one that is of itself strange\r\nor repugnant to the Chinese mind. It has even, apparently, been\r\ncontemplated by the Dowager-Empress herself, though her choice would\r\nnot unnaturally fall upon a spot like Hsi An Fu, near which town, at\r\nHao, at Hsien Yang, and at Chang An, the emperors of the Chou dynasty\r\n(B.C. 1122–781), the Tsin (B.C. 249–200), and the Sui (A.D. 582–904)\r\nheld their courts. But the chief charm of such a capital would be its\r\ninaccessibility and remoteness from the haunts of the foreign devil.\r\nHsi An Fu would be Peking over again, and worse. It would give the\r\n_coup de grâce_ to all hope of civilising the court.\r\n\r\nIn a letter published in the _Times_ newspaper of June 22 I advocated\r\nonce more the choice of Nanking as a new seat of Government, and I\r\nsaid that such a change would be hailed with joy by many millions of\r\nChinese. A few days after that letter appeared my arguments received\r\na very remarkable confirmation. A telegram from Yokohama informed us\r\nthat the Chinese community in Japan, a highly intelligent, educated,\r\nand respectable body of men, of first-rate business capacity, had\r\npresented a petition urging the foreign powers to take advantage of\r\nthe settlement which must follow upon the present troubles, to insist\r\nupon the removal of the capital from Peking to Nanking. Now these men\r\nknow what they are talking about. They know that such a change would\r\nwork wonders in the direction of good government; that it would take\r\nthe power out of the fossilised hands of the court; that the light of\r\nday would be fatal to the bats and owls of the forbidden city; that the\r\nsecret societies would be deprived of their chief support; that the\r\nviceroys and the whole descending scale of mandarins, brought under\r\ncontrol of an intelligible and intelligent Government, would no longer\r\nbe able to squeeze and persecute the people, paralysing trade by their\r\nextortions and blackmailing, and setting up insuperable barriers to the\r\nprogress of civilisation.\r\n\r\nIn the Blue Book published recently (July 30) we have the first\r\ninstalment of the official history of the tragedy of Peking—most\r\nmelancholy reading, truly! But there is one bright spot in this\r\nmiserable record. The attitude of our Foreign Office in all the\r\nnegotiations which have taken place appears to have been altogether\r\nadmirable. In spite of the cold water thrown by international\r\njealousies upon Lord Salisbury’s efforts to retrieve the situation, he\r\nhas held his own position, and he has succeeded in using the best means\r\nwhich were available without in any way compromising the future. Japan\r\nis to furnish troops, but there are no vague promises, no encouragement\r\nof inordinate ambitions, and no raising of hopes, which, if realised,\r\nmight be fraught with dangers beside which even the horrors of the last\r\nfew weeks would be as child’s play. Lord Salisbury boldly promises to\r\nfind the money, and England will honour his bill. That is all. “Her\r\nMajesty’s Government wish to draw a sharp distinction between immediate\r\noperations which may be still in time to save the Legations, and any\r\nulterior operations which may be undertaken.” No language could be\r\nclearer or more satisfactory than this. Is it too much to hope that\r\nwhen the final settlement comes, the counsels of the same master-mind\r\nmay devise a solution which shall bring about a happier era for China,\r\nwithout endangering the harmony of those nations which are now united\r\nin their resentment of outrages, for which the history of the world\r\nfinds no parallel?\r\n\r\nBesides the Blue Book, recent events have produced a plentiful crop\r\nof letters to the newspapers, many of them written with great ability\r\nand knowledge of Chinese affairs. The deposition of the undoubtedly\r\nguilty Empress, and the restoration to power of the Emperor, with a\r\nGovernment composed of the progressive party to which he is inclined,\r\nare with most of the writers a _sine qua non_. To this I say Amen. “The\r\nmurderer Tuan must be executed” is a favourite cry. By all means; but\r\nwe know what is the first postulate in the cooking of a hare. Prince\r\nTuan will hardly be more easy to catch than was Nana Sahib in 1857.\r\nIf the Emperor, a weakling at best, be left at Peking in a hotbed of\r\nharem intrigues and secret societies, how can he be protected? Will\r\nhis life be worth many days’ purchase? Will a progressive ministry be\r\nable to exercise any authority over the great provincial satraps? The\r\nforeign representatives will be locked up in the old death-trap, and in\r\nten, twenty, thirty years history will repeat itself. The inviolable\r\nsanctity of Legations with such surroundings becomes a most miserable\r\nfarce.\r\n\r\nThe return to the _status quo ante_, with all its possibility of\r\ntragic repetitions, is just the sort of lame and impotent conclusion\r\nto which we have accustomed the Chinese, and in their dealings with us\r\nthey count upon a moderation which, like all Asiatics, they construe\r\ninto fear, and despise accordingly. A barren conquest like that of\r\n1860, which left things as they were, is something which they cannot\r\nunderstand. When Li Hung Chang, who knows exactly what string it\r\nis best to harp upon, sweetly urges us to arouse “the gratitude of\r\nmillions” by abstention from revenge, be sure his gentle mind sees its\r\nway to turn such magnanimity to good account. The horrors of to-day\r\nwere begotten of the mistakes of 1860 and 1870. Let us hope that 1900\r\nmay be the parent of a less ill-omened brood.\r\n\r\n                                  ————\r\n\r\nThose who desire to study the political problems of the Far East will\r\nfind admirable instruction in Mr. Chirol’s the _Far Eastern Question_\r\n(Macmillan), in Mr. Colquhoun’s _Overland to China_, and in the same\r\nwriter’s more recently published _The Problem in China and British\r\nPolicy_.\r\n\r\nMy best thanks are due to the proprietors of the _Times_ newspaper for\r\npermission to reproduce here their admirable plan of Peking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                LETTER I\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       HONG-KONG, _23rd April 1865_.\r\n\r\nLife at sea may be a very pleasant one for those who like it, but I\r\ndoubt whether any one ever arrived at the end of a voyage of a month\r\nand a half by one of the P. and O. Co.’s steamers without uttering an\r\nexpression of thanksgiving, hearty and sincere. The monotony of the\r\never-recurring daily occupations is killing. However,\r\n\r\n    Be the day weary or be the day long,\r\n    At length it ringeth to evensong,—\r\n\r\neven Hong-kong is reached at last.\r\n\r\nWe rush up on deck after breakfast to see the first of the brown,\r\nsun-scorched island. It is shrouded in mist, however, and there is\r\nnot much to look at. But every one is excited and flurried, and\r\nin the happiness of realising the luxury of being on land, we\r\nfeel kindly towards all mankind, and bid a cordial farewell to our\r\nfellow-passengers. In a short while we are in harbour, and the little\r\ncolony, planted at the foot of wild and rugged hills matching those\r\nof the mainland opposite, lies before us. A crowd of boats plying for\r\nhire, and partly manned, to use a bull, by women often pulling away\r\nlustily with a baby slung across their backs, hail us with cries of\r\n“Wanchee boat?” “Wanchee big boat?” These Chinese boatwomen are real\r\nwonders. Hardy, strong, and burnt by the sun, they look and probably\r\nare as sturdy as any of the men. At any rate I saw one woman fight and\r\nthrash a couple of stalwart young boatmen; and a good stand-up fight\r\nit was, give and take. They did not spare her, and she belaboured them\r\nmost lustily, screaming and chattering all the while in a way that\r\nwould have frightened Billingsgate itself into silence. The boats seem\r\nto hold whole families,—even the nursery,—the small boys wearing corks\r\nor bottles to keep them afloat when they tumble overboard. The girls,\r\nbeing reckoned of no value, take their chance, and wear nothing to\r\nprotect them. As soon as we came to an anchor the boats of the great\r\ncommercial firms came alongside, each probably steered by a partner\r\neager to hear the latest news or to welcome a friend. One by one the\r\npassengers disappear, and he who has letters for one of the merchant\r\nprinces of China may look forward to luxurious quarters and a warm\r\nwelcome, for nowhere else is hospitality carried to such an extent as\r\nit is here.\r\n\r\nThe houses in Hong-kong are large and airy. Lofty and spacious rooms\r\nnot overloaded with furniture (for everything is dispensed with an\r\neye to the getting the most air and coolness) look out on to a broad\r\nverandah, which is shaded with green rush blinds to keep out the glare.\r\nHere bamboo lounging chairs, of indescribable comfort, hold out arms\r\nthat invite one to doze away the sultry afternoon, or sit smoking a\r\ncheroot and sipping cool drinks in the most luxurious laziness. The\r\nclean and neat matting on the floors, the rare curiosities and jars\r\nwhich decorate the principal rooms, the quiet, mouse-like steps of\r\nthe China boys in their blue dresses, who act as servants, coming in\r\nto take an order or deliver a message in their quaint pidgin English,\r\ngive a peculiar and original stamp to the whole, which is of itself\r\nimmensely refreshing. Everything speaks of rest and quiet, and yet it\r\nis in these quiet, idle-seeming houses—very castles of Indolence they\r\nappear—that busy brains are at work, toiling all day, calculating rises\r\nand falls, watching chances by which thousands are won or lost in a\r\nday. In the old days when the opium trade was unlawful, and therefore\r\nat its height, when the rival houses had each their fast sailing\r\nclippers racing against one another from Bombay and Calcutta, and the\r\nfirst to arrive would lie hidden round the corner of the bay, and send\r\na man on shore across the hills with the all-important intelligence,\r\nonly showing itself when a price had been made, the life of a man\r\nof business at Hong-kong must have been one of untold excitement.\r\nNowadays every man gets his letters by the mail, the opium trade is\r\nlegitimatised, and there is no longer the same amount of “go” and dash\r\nabout the thing. Still, a venture of tea to the tune of a million of\r\ndollars, upon which 40 or 50 per cent may be made or lost, must be\r\nexciting enough for most men. Just at present the China trade is in\r\na singularly bad way; vast sums have been lost in tea speculations;\r\nsome of the larger houses have been very hard hit, but with plenty\r\nof capital at their backs have stood the shock well. Smaller firms,\r\nhowever, not having the same elasticity, have sunk under it; smashes\r\nand rumours of smashes are rife; and the only men who have not suffered\r\nare those who, with wise prescience, have folded their hands and done\r\nnothing, waiting for better times.\r\n\r\nHong-kong presents perhaps one of the oddest jumbles in the whole\r\nworld. It is neither fish, flesh, fowl, nor good red-herring. The\r\nGovernment and principal people are English—the population are\r\nChinese—the police are Indians—the language is bastard English mixed\r\nwith Cantonese—the currency is the Mexican dollar, and the elements no\r\nmore amalgamate than the oil and vinegar in a salad. The Europeans hate\r\nthe Chinese, and the latter return the compliment with interest. In the\r\nstreets Chinamen, Indian policemen, Malays, Parsees, and half-castes\r\njostle up against Europeans, naval and military officers, Jack-tars,\r\nsoldiers, and loafers of all denominations. Constantinople, Smyrna,\r\nand Cairo show more picturesque and varied crowds, but nothing can be\r\nmore grotesque than the street life of Hong-kong. The local cab is a\r\ngreen chair[3] open in front and covered in at the top, in which you\r\nmay sit Yankeewise, with your feet sprawling above your head, and be\r\ncarried along at a good pace by a couple of strong-shouldered coolies\r\nwith shaven polls, long tails, and huge umbrella hats. Plenty of these\r\nare waiting for hire at every corner. They have a fixed tariff of ten\r\ncents the trip. The weights that these coolies carry slung on their\r\nbamboo-poles are something surprising. I have seen Turkish hamals\r\nbent nearly double under the most impossible loads, such as no London\r\nrailway porter would look at; but it makes one’s shoulders ache to see\r\nthe Chinamen fetch and carry, for they do not hold the poles in their\r\nhands with the support of a shoulder-strap, like the chairmen who used\r\nto take old ladies out to tea and scandal in English country towns,\r\nbut the bamboo poles are fastened at the ends, and the men simply\r\nhoist them on to their shoulders and stagger off under them. Both men\r\nand women of the lower orders are certainly to our eyes mightily\r\nill-favoured, and have villainous countenances which, if all tales\r\nbe true, do not belie their characters; but now and then one comes\r\nacross a pretty creature enough, some Cantonese, probably, as frail as\r\nfair—for St. Antony is not generally worshipped in seaside garrison\r\ntowns. The long plaited tails worn by the men, and eked out with silk\r\nuntil they reach nearly to the heels, are a never-ending source of\r\nwonder to the new-comer. But there is one fashion of shaving the poll,\r\nleaving here and there a hair like the bristles on a gooseberry, which\r\nis peculiarly droll in its effect—a “coiffure à la groseille.” The\r\nChinaman is very careful of his tail, and no cat has a greater horror\r\nof wetting her coat than he has of a drop of rain falling on his back\r\nhair. To cut it off is the height of indignity; and when the Chinese\r\nsailors on board the P. and O. ships have been stealing opium from\r\nthe cargo, which they find it very hard to keep their hands off, they\r\nare tied up by their tails to the capstan and summarily flogged; in\r\nwhich case they become useful as well as ornamental. The barber drives\r\na brisk trade; nor does he confine himself to shaving, clipping, and\r\nplaiting; he has also cunning instruments with which he cleans the\r\neyes and ears of his clients, the result of which is that the drums\r\nof their ears are often injured, and the poor patients afflicted with\r\nchronic deafness.\r\n\r\nIn this island of contrasts none is greater than that between the\r\nEuropean and Chinese quarters of the town. In the former the houses\r\nare large and well built of gray slate-coloured bricks and fine\r\ngranite, and others, some of which will be real palaces, are in course\r\nof construction. In the latter, on the contrary, the houses are low\r\nand mean. They are generally built with one story: on the ground\r\nfloor is the shop with its various goods and quaint perpendicular\r\ninscriptions and advertisements; on the first floor, which is thrown\r\nout over the footway and supported by wooden posts, so as to form a\r\ncovered walk, the family live, and here the ugly old women—uglier\r\nin China than anywhere—and queer little yellow children may be seen\r\npeering out of their dens at the passers-by. Towards evening, when the\r\npaper lanterns are lighted and the shops are shut up, not by doors\r\nand shutters as with us, but by a sort of cage of bamboo poles,\r\nthrough which the interior is visible, the Chinese house looks very\r\nfantastic and strange. This quarter of the town bears a very bad name.\r\nIt swarms with houses of the worst repute, and low grog-shops which\r\nare largely patronised by the sailors. The coolies in the street are\r\na most ruffianly looking lot, not pleasant to meet in a by-road alone\r\nand unarmed. Indeed, life and property seem to be by no means so safe\r\nin the colony as they should be, considering the force which is kept\r\nhere. A short time since a gentleman was attacked in broad daylight in\r\nthe middle of the town, knocked down and robbed; and it is downright\r\ndangerous to venture on the hills alone without the moral influence of\r\na revolver. The Chinamen are very clever thieves and housebreakers, and\r\nwill even venture into barracks, smuggle themselves into the officers’\r\nquarters, burn a little opium under the nose of some sleeping hero,\r\nand in double-quick time clear the room of watch, chain, loose cash,\r\nand valuables. Sometimes, however, they get caught. The other night a\r\nyoung officer was too quick for one of these light-fingered gentlemen,\r\nand pinned him just as he was making off. A mighty pretty dressing\r\nhe got too—for when the officers were tired of thrashing him, with\r\ningenious cruelty they turned him into the lock-up where the drunken\r\nsoldiers were, and I leave you to guess what sort of a night he spent.\r\nIt is said that a Hindoo will rob a man of the sheet he is sleeping on\r\nwithout disturbing him, but I think to clear the goods out of a large\r\nwarehouse under the owner’s nose, and with the police looking on, is\r\nat least as great a feat. This happened in this wise. A “godown” or\r\nstorehouse full of valuable goods was fixed upon, a number of coolies\r\nwalked in one fine day with a “comprador” (headman, bailiff, steward,\r\nand factotum), and with the utmost innocence set to work emptying the\r\nplace, the pretended comprador all the while, in the most businesslike\r\nmanner, making notes of the bales which were sent down to the quay\r\nand shipped off in small boats. One coolie is so like another that no\r\nwonder the policeman who was standing by thought it was all right, and\r\nthe very audacity of the robbery put him off his guard. By the time the\r\ntheft was discovered, goods, coolies, and comprador were well out of\r\nreach, and the owner was left lamenting over his empty godown.\r\n\r\nIt is rather hard on a man when he first comes to these parts to\r\nhave to learn a new dialect of his own language more bizarre than\r\nbroad Somersetshire, more unintelligible than that of Tennyson’s\r\nnorthern farmer. This is the Cantonese or “pidgin” English. Pidgin\r\nmeans business, of which word it is not difficult to see that it is a\r\ncorruption, and the jargon is the _patois_ that has invented itself\r\nfor transacting affairs with the natives. Use a plain English word to\r\na Chinaman, and he will stare and “no sabé”; but distort it, add a\r\nsyllable or two, put it in its wrong place, and, in short, make it so\r\nunlike itself that its own root would not acknowledge it, and he will\r\ncatch your meaning at once. Several Chinese, Portuguese, and other\r\nwords of doubtful pedigree, mixed up with this maltreated English, make\r\nup the lingo, which is a literal translation of Chinese syntax, and\r\npuzzling enough at first. Here is a specimen. I should tell you that in\r\npidgin bull is _male_, cow _female_. An English gentleman from Shanghai\r\nwent to call at a friend’s house in Hong-kong. The door was opened\r\nby the head Chinese boy. “Mississee have got?” said the gentleman.\r\n“Have got,” answered the boy, “but just now no can see.” “How fashion\r\nno can see?” The boy answered, grinning from ear to ear, “Last night\r\nhave catchee one number one piecee bull chilo!” The lady of the house\r\nhad been safely brought to bed during the night of a fine baby boy!\r\nSometimes the boy will dot his I’s and cross his T’s with unfortunate\r\ndistinctness as to the occupations in which his master or mistress is\r\nengaged, putting one in mind of Gavarni’s _Enfants Terribles_. It is\r\nnot to be wondered at that the coolies and servant boys should talk\r\nthis lingo, but that clever, intelligent fellows like the compradors in\r\nbig houses should not have acquired a better form of English is indeed\r\nstrange.\r\n\r\nLife at Hong-kong passes away pleasantly enough. The residents are very\r\nrich, and they spend their money like princes. Their hospitality is\r\nboundless, and open house is the rule. I can fancy no better quarters\r\nfor a naval or military man. The climate is very different from what\r\nit used to be, and has become very healthy; but if a man should fall\r\nill he can get away north to Peking, or run up to Japan, or choose\r\nbetween a dozen trips nearer at hand. The usual daily routine here at\r\nthis season of the year is as follows:—At six your boy wakes you with\r\na cup of tea; you rise and bathe, and read or write till it is time to\r\ndress for breakfast at twelve (the merchants, of course, go to their\r\noffices at ten or even much earlier). Breakfast, as it is called, is a\r\nregular set meal with several courses, and champagne or claret; any one\r\ncomes in who pleases, and is sure of a cordial welcome, and probably an\r\ninvitation to return to dinner. After a cup of coffee and a cheroot,\r\noffice work begins again, and goes on until about five, when every one\r\nturns out to ride, drive, or walk until seven, which is the hour for\r\ngossip, and sherry and bitters at the club, a first-rate establishment\r\nto which strangers are admitted as visitors, and where a man may put\r\nup if he pleases. Dinner is at eight, and a very serious affair it is,\r\nfor Hong-kong is fond of good living and fine vintages; and this rule\r\ndoes not apply only to the heads of houses, for their clerks are lodged\r\nand boarded exactly on the same scale as themselves, and a boy who has\r\nbeen content to dine for a shilling at a London chop-house, sits down\r\nhere to a dinner fit for a duke, criticises the champagne and claret\r\nwith the air of a connoisseur, and rattles in his pocket £300 or £400\r\na year for his _menus plaisirs_. Which shows the superiority of vulgar\r\nfractions to genteel Latin and Greek.\r\n\r\nThe rides and drives about Hong-kong are in their way very pretty,\r\nthough the almost entire absence of trees presents a violent contrast\r\nto the rich tropical vegetation of Singapore and Penang. On the other\r\nhand, both on the mainland and in the island itself, there are bold,\r\nrugged mountain outlines, often shrouded in a mist that reminds one\r\nof Scotland and Ireland; huge boulders of rock from which beautiful\r\nferns of every variety (fifty-two species have been classed) grow in\r\nprofusion; a bay studded with wild barren islands; and to the east,\r\nwhere the colony is only separated from the mainland by about a mile of\r\nsea, the picturesque peninsula of Kowloon. The racecourse in the Happy\r\nValley is a lovely spot. It is surrounded by hills on three sides, and\r\nfrom the fourth, which is close to the bay, one looks up a blue glen\r\nsuch as Sir Walter Scott might have described. Here on the slope of\r\nthe hill is the cemetery, and here and at Government House there are\r\nsome trees, among which the graceful bamboo is conspicuous. But it is\r\nthe south-west of the island that is most affected by the residents. At\r\na place called Pok Fo Lum, about four miles off, several of the rich\r\nmerchants have built bungalows to which in summer-time, after stewing\r\nall day in their offices, it is their wont to resort of an afternoon,\r\nand let the fresh sea-breeze clear their brains of tea, opium, silk,\r\nrises and falls, and such-like cobwebs. On a fine evening these gardens\r\nare a very pleasant lounge. At the back rises the Peak, a fine bold\r\nrock some 1700 feet high; all around are sweet-scented tropical flowers\r\nteeming with strange, many-coloured insects and gorgeous butterflies;\r\nwhile in front the view stretches to the mainland hills across the\r\nbrilliant sea rippling against little islands, and covered with\r\nflotillas of native boats, peaceful enough to all appearance, but ever\r\nready for any little piece of light piracy that may turn up.\r\n\r\nI was very anxious before leaving the south of China to see Canton,\r\nand accordingly on the 28th April I started with a friend in one of\r\nthe huge house-steamers that ply between Hong-kong and Canton, and\r\nare of themselves curiosities. They are divided into separate parts\r\nfor Europeans, Parsees, and natives of the poorer class, with loose\r\nboxes into which bettermost Chinese families are put. You may form\r\nsome idea of their size when I tell you that three weeks ago, on the\r\noccasion of a festival, our boat the _Kin Shan_ took up 2063 Chinamen\r\nto Canton, whither they were bound to “chin-chin” the graves of their\r\nancestors. In all American steamers—and this is a Yankee venture—speed\r\nis the great object, and we accomplished the distance, between 80 and\r\n90 miles, under the six hours.\r\n\r\nWe had a bright sunny morning for our expedition, and the harbour of\r\nHong-kong appeared to great advantage, for there were plenty of fleecy\r\nclouds in the sky throwing fantastic shadows over the hills around.\r\nThe sea was as calm and transparent as a lake, and we could sit in the\r\nbest cabin, which is a huge building on the forecastle, catching every\r\nbreath of air, and enjoying the scenery. The river-banks are at first\r\nwild, barren, and hilly, like Hong-kong, but higher up there begin to\r\nbe signs of cultivation. Plantains and rice, which is the greenest\r\nof all green grasses, grow in profusion among the snipe marshes.\r\nBamboos spring up close to the water’s edge, and the hills are lower,\r\nless savage-looking, and more fruitful. Ruined forts, destroyed when\r\nwe forced our trade upon the unwilling Chinese, numberless boats and\r\njunks, here and there a pagoda with different sorts of plants peeping\r\nout of its many stories, tell us that we are drawing near a town, and\r\nafter about four hours and a half we reach Wampoa, a miserable place,\r\nwith about as dirty and degraded-looking a population as could be seen\r\nanywhere. A few lime kilns, soy or ketchup factories, and dry docks\r\nwhere ships are brought to have their keels cleaned of barnacles and\r\nsea-muck, seem to constitute all the business of the place. I shall\r\nalways henceforth look upon soy as the essence of the dirt of Wampoa.\r\n\r\nCanton itself does not present a very clean face to be washed by the\r\nunsavoury river. If any one should come here expecting to see a fine\r\ncity of quays and palaces, he will be grievously disappointed. Myriads\r\nof low dirty wooden houses, built almost in the very water itself,\r\nare crowded together higgledy piggledy, without order or method. As if\r\nthese were not enough, there are whole streets, alleys, and quarters\r\nof the foulest boat-houses, all swarming with human, and probably\r\nother, life. Junks in numbers, carrying guns for defence, and if a safe\r\nopportunity occurs, for offence, are moored in the stream. Strange,\r\ngrotesque craft they are, with their huge bows built to represent\r\nthe heads of sea-monsters; a great eye is painted on each side, for\r\nthe Chinese treat their ships as reasoning beings, and say, “S’pose\r\nno got eye, no can see; s’pose no can see, no can walkee,” which is\r\nunanswerable—even the _Kin Shan_ carries an eye on each paddle-box in\r\ndeference to this idea. But as at Hong-kong, the chief peculiarity of\r\nthe river scene here is the crowd of small boats with female crews. The\r\nmother pulls the stroke oar, the aunt the bow, and grandmamma is at\r\nthe helm with a third. I am sure there must have been several hundreds\r\nof these yellow ladies round the steamer at one time. The parrot-house\r\nat the Zoological Gardens was silence itself by comparison, for hard\r\nwork, and strong pulling, have given them lungs of leather. They\r\nall claim acquaintance, and employment on the strength of it. “My\r\nboatee, my boatee, my no see you Cheena side long tim.” We had our\r\nown boat, however, and with patience cleared a way and got to shore.\r\nBut no description of the Canton River would be complete without an\r\nallusion to the famous “flower-boats.” Huge, unwieldy barges they\r\nare, moored by the river-side, and tricked out with every paltry\r\ndecoration of cheap gilding, paper lanterns, and bizarre ornament that\r\nthe Owen Jones of China can invent. These are the temples of Venus.\r\nThe priestesses are mostly brown ugly little women in sad-coloured\r\ngarments, upon whose flat yellow faces the rosy paint looks even more\r\nghastly than on Europeans; some are almost pretty, however, and all\r\nhave beautiful hands and feet (when the latter have not been wantonly\r\ndeformed), indeed this is the one gift of beauty common to all the\r\nChinese, and the very men-servants who wait upon one have hands kept\r\ndelicately clean, and so well formed that many an European lady might\r\nenvy them; they have no need to wrap a napkin round their thumbs, nor\r\nto wear white cotton gloves; their taper fingers and filbert nails are\r\npleasant to look upon. At night, when the lanterns are lighted, and\r\nthe tawdriness of the decorations is less offensive, the flower-boats\r\nlook gay enough, and they are one of the sights of Canton. The trade\r\nthat their denizens ply is not looked upon as disgraceful, nor does it\r\nprevent their marrying respectably afterwards,—at least so it is said.\r\n\r\nWe had had an empty house placed at our disposal, and we took with\r\nus a servant, a coolie, and a native cook. And this brings me to the\r\nrecord of a feat. When we arrived at our house we found that the boy in\r\ncharge (a “boy,” like the boy in Oliver Twist, may be a very old man)\r\nhad gone off to “chin-chin” his ancestors’ graves, a ceremony which,\r\nalthough our coming had been announced to him, could on no account be\r\ndeferred. So there we were at half-past three, without so much as a\r\nscrap of fuel or a gridiron to put upon it. In spite of this we sat\r\ndown, four of us, at eight o’clock, to a dinner of mulligatawny soup,\r\nsoles, for which the river is famous, three _entrées_, a buffalo’s\r\nhump, like boiled beef idealised, snipes, curried prawns, and a dessert\r\nof plantains, oranges, rose apples, tasting just like rose leaves, and\r\ndried lychees, the whole being decked out in the most excellent taste,\r\nwith a profusion of the sweetest scented and most brilliant flowers.\r\nWe had our wine with us, and altogether I never sat down to a better\r\ndinner. Could any English servants, arriving at an empty house in\r\nLondon, have done the same? The Chinese, when they have learnt to cook\r\nafter our fashion, are the best _chefs_ in the world. You see the art\r\nrequires delicacy of hand, plenty of imagination, and does not involve\r\na knowledge of perspective, so it just suits their talents.\r\n\r\nI am afraid I can give you but a poor description of Canton; the\r\ninventory is too large to be taken in a letter. Mr. Sala or any of the\r\nprofessed literary appraisers would find matter for at least a chapter\r\nin the bad smells. The streets are very narrow. Three men might walk\r\nabreast in them, and perhaps you might throw in a boy if he was very\r\ntiny indeed. On each side are small, low shops, which throw out such a\r\nmultitude of lanterns and perpendicular notices, like the attenuated\r\nghosts of many-coloured banners, that they look as if a solemn\r\nprocession in a pantomime had been changed by a tap of the harlequin’s\r\nwand into a scene of streets and advertisements. As if the gangway\r\nwere not narrow enough, hucksters and costermongers, offering every\r\nkind of goods for sale, hold their stalls on each available square foot\r\nof pavement. There are meat stalls, fruit stalls, sweetmeat stalls,\r\nsugar-cane stalls, fish stalls, and what can only be designated as\r\noffal stalls. The yellowest crowd in the world hustles along pell-mell\r\nat a furious rate, for every one is busy and every one is in a hurry.\r\nCoolies carrying every conceivable burden balance-wise, from a load of\r\ntimber to a bundle of leeks, rush at one, and it needs a sharp look-out\r\nto steer clear of their bamboo poles. Round the corner, lolling in\r\nhis chair, for all the world like one of those “magots” Frenchwomen\r\nare so fond of, a Chinese dignitary is borne along, attended by five\r\nor six policemen in white caps and red tassels, nearly upsetting a\r\nsmall-footed lady, who has just time to totter out of the way on her\r\nrickety legs. If there is a clear space, you may be sure there is a\r\ndoctor or fortune-teller peering into his patient’s mouth, like a groom\r\nexamining a horse’s teeth, or tapping his head mysteriously with a fan,\r\nto the wonder of a small gaping circle. Barring in very rare instances\r\na dog or two—for the wary little beasts seem to know the danger that\r\nthey run of being turned into butchers’ meat if they stray out of their\r\nown domain—no animals are to be seen. Beasts of burden are represented\r\nby the men, and beasts of draught there are none; indeed, no carriage,\r\ncart, or costermonger’s barrow could thread its way here. The amount\r\nof industry to be seen in a single street is something surprising.\r\nCarpenters, cobblers, turners, carvers—artisans, in short, of all\r\nguilds, are toiling away for dear life—no one is idle. The butcher\r\nis busy separating the coarser from the finer parts of the meat; the\r\nfishmonger gutting his fish, and setting the entrails carefully on one\r\nside—there is no part too vile or mean, none too dear and delicate to\r\nfind a customer. Chow-chow dogs (I saw such a pretty little puppy being\r\ncarried off to execution; he looked like a brown spitz, and I felt\r\ninclined to buy his release), birds’ nests, rice-birds, the beccafichi\r\nof China, and all manner of delicacies, are cheek-by-jowl with equally\r\nnumerous abominations, not to speak of rats and “such small deer.” The\r\ngreengrocers’ are the most tempting of the provision shops; they at\r\nleast show nothing offensive, and they make their fruit look to the\r\ngreatest advantage, setting oranges, apples, lychees, and vegetables in\r\ncurious patterns, while ropes of bananas, leeks, young lettuces, and\r\nother greens hang from the ceiling. Competition is great, and with the\r\nutmost labour it is hard to earn a living, for the two cities, Tartar\r\nand Chinese, with their suburbs, hold an immense population, not to\r\nspeak of the thousands who are born, live, and die in the boats, and\r\nhave no part or share in the land until they come in for that property\r\nsix feet by three, which is the common inheritance. Altogether, taking\r\nboth sides of the river, there are probably a million and a half of\r\ninhabitants, of whom not more than one hundred are Europeans.\r\n\r\nUntil the return of the English to Canton, it used to be a point of\r\nhonour with the Chinese at Hong-kong to try and persuade people that\r\nthe bombardment of 1856 had not done much damage. If they were asked\r\nwhether Yeh’s Palace or Yamên had been injured they would answer,\r\n“Not too muchee; my hab hear they breakee that cup that saucer; that\r\nalloo.” But the fact is that the city still bears the marks of the\r\npunishment it received; considerable spaces have been laid waste by\r\nfire; Yeh’s Yamên has been razed to the ground and its site “annexed”\r\nby the French, who are building a cathedral and Jesuit college upon\r\nit. Notwithstanding the havoc made by shot and shell, however, there\r\nis much to be seen. The Yamêns of the Viceroy, the Governor, and\r\nother high functionaries are standing. I only saw the outsides of\r\nthese palaces. They are all pretty much alike. An arched gateway,\r\nwith a colossal warrior painted in fresco on either side, faces a\r\nblank wall, on which is drawn the outline of some fabulous monster,\r\nand this appears to be used for notices and announcements; marble\r\nkylins and grotesque beasts adorn the courtyard, which is crowded with\r\nfunctionaries and dependants. The roofs are fretted into a thousand\r\nquaint designs; but you are as familiar with their style as I am, and\r\nas I shall probably in some future letter have an opportunity of saying\r\nsomething about the interior of a Chinese officer’s palace, I had\r\nbetter let the subject alone now.\r\n\r\nOf course we went to see the “Temple of Punishments” and that of the\r\nFive Hundred Saints, which last is one of the celebrities of China.\r\nThe former is so called from its containing models of all the various\r\nmodes which Chinese ingenuity has invented for torturing malefactors.\r\nGuarding the portals are two colossal “josses” or idols, represented\r\nwith vermilion faces and a prodigious corpulency. Bits of paper, as\r\nvotive offerings, some with inscriptions, but more without, are pinned\r\nor fastened to them by the pious: this is a Chinese method of showing\r\nrespect to the graves of their dead, and to their gods. Inside the gate\r\nis a large courtyard, which we found crowded with people; all around\r\nwere little tables at which sat fortune-tellers, some young men, others\r\nveterans with scanty beards and enormous tortoise-shell spectacles,\r\nwriting as solemnly as judges. Here in bamboo divisions are the dolls\r\nwhich give the temple its name, and very horrible are the scenes which\r\nthey represent; beyond the courtyard is the real joss-house, from which\r\nI carried away a confused idea of tinsel, artificial flowers, scraps of\r\npaper, and gloom.\r\n\r\nFar more interesting was the Temple of the Five Hundred Saints. In the\r\ngateway, as in the former case, two josses of stupendous size mount\r\nguard. One is represented as solacing himself with a tune on a kind of\r\nmandoline; and I noticed that many of the scraps of paper with which\r\nhe has been “chin-chinned” were cut in the shape of his favourite\r\ninstrument. Without let or hindrance we wandered through a maze of\r\nwhite-washed and neatly-kept cloisters, until we came to the refectory\r\n(for there is a monastery attached to this temple), where we found the\r\nmonks at their afternoon meal. Just as we arrived, a tiny musical-toned\r\nbell was sounded, at which signal the brethren rose, and what appeared\r\nto be a short prayer or grace was recited in chorus, after which a\r\nmonk of higher rank, preceded by an attendant, left the hall, which\r\nwas a square room with long tables, and fenced off from the cloisters\r\nat one end by a low bamboo railing. As soon as the great man was gone\r\nthe others fell to at their chopsticks and small bowls with renewed\r\nvigour. The monks wear a long light gray robe, and they shave the whole\r\nhead, but in other respects their dress does not differ from that of\r\nlaymen. The temple itself is a large hall in which the five hundred,\r\nplaced in alleys at right angles, sit facing one another in all their\r\nmajesty. They are all of gilt metal or wood, and under life size, if\r\none may use such a term with regard to idols. They are represented in\r\nevery variety of attitude, occupation, and expression. Some are playing\r\non musical instruments, and are bland; others are evidently preaching,\r\nand are didactic; others are inflicting punishment or doing battle, and\r\nare very fierce; one is performing a difficult act of horsemanship on a\r\nlarge kylin, while two smaller kylins are looking on in admiration—one\r\nand all are made to look fat and comfortable, with huge paunches.\r\nBefore each is placed a small green porcelain pot filled with the ashes\r\nof the joss-sticks which have been burnt in his honour. The monks were\r\nuniformly civil to us, and neither here nor in the Temple of Horrors\r\nwas any fee asked or expected; how much better it would be if Europeans\r\nwould follow the example of these heathens, and not ask admission fees\r\nin their cathedrals and churches.\r\n\r\nYou may well imagine that during a first visit to a great Chinese city\r\neverything appeared strange and marvellous, but the greatest wonder of\r\nall was that we should be able to wander hither and thither, intruding\r\ninto temples, thrusting our curious noses into every hole and corner,\r\nlike ferrets in a rabbit warren, elbowing our way unmolested through\r\ncrowds that a very few years ago would have mobbed and brick-batted at\r\nleast, and perhaps tortured and murdered by inches, any European that\r\nventured outside the factories. It seems almost a fatality that now\r\nthat the city is safe, and its inhabitants peacefully inclined, the\r\nopening of the Yang-Tse-Chiang should have turned the European traffic\r\nwith the interior, of which Canton was formerly the headquarters, into\r\na new channel. The prosperity of Canton is evident, and very striking.\r\nBut it is a native and self-containing prosperity, and in no ways\r\ndependent on Europe, and shows that the Chinese were quite right when\r\nthey asserted that they could do very well without us. Just before the\r\nprincipal English firms withdrew their representatives from the city,\r\nfinding that the little business there was to do could be more cheaply\r\ntransacted by agents drawing a small percentage, an arrangement was\r\nmade with the local government whereby we became the lessees of a\r\nsmall mud island, which had to be filled in at a great cost, called\r\nShah-Meen. This was to become the English quarter. The church and\r\nnew consular buildings have been erected there, and there are a few\r\nempty bungalows belonging to merchants, but the place does not seem\r\nlikely ever to wear a look of great importance; the merchants see no\r\nlikelihood of an inducement to return, so Shah-Meen has so far been a\r\npoor bargain.\r\n\r\nNot far from Shah-Meen are the pleasure-gardens of a merchant named\r\nPo-Ting-Qua. Terraces, summer-houses, stairs, drawbridges, carp-ponds,\r\nrock-work, and flowers are thrown together most fantastically, exactly\r\nlike the gardens that the ladies and gentlemen on teacups and plates\r\nwalk about in. The doors are cut out of the walls in quaint shapes,\r\nsuch as circles, jars, bottles, etc. As the rainy season has set in the\r\ngarden was not looking its best, but it was very pretty nevertheless,\r\nalthough there was a little too much stagnant water about for our\r\nideas. Lord Bacon in his essay on gardens says: “For fountains they are\r\na great beauty and refreshment; but pools mar all and make the garden\r\nunwholesome, and full of flies and frogs.” If this is true in England,\r\nhow much more does it apply to the East. Such things as flower-beds are\r\nunknown here. The plants grow anyhow, without order or arrangement, but\r\nthey are carefully tended, and indeed the whole place was beautifully\r\nkept, and there seemed to be a large staff of gardeners and carpenters,\r\nwho play a conspicuous part in a Chinese garden.\r\n\r\nYou will be wanting to hear about the curiosity shops. I went to\r\nsee them, but found nothing but rubbish at outrageous prices. The\r\nChinese buy up everything good at any price. The dealers carry round\r\ntheir best things to the native connoisseurs, and put off any trash\r\nupon chance customers, swearing that everything is “oloo and culew,”\r\nold and curious. I bought one small bottle for a few shillings as a\r\nsouvenir of Canton, but even if I had had heaps of money, there was no\r\ntemptation to spend it. I found an old friend at Canton in the person\r\nof Mr. R., our consul, who was a most amiable cicerone. He has passed\r\nthe chief part of his life in China, and is a great authority upon\r\nall matters connected with our relations with the Chinese. He lives\r\nin a fascinatingly picturesque Yamên with quite an extensive garden—a\r\ncuriosity in itself,—we spent most of the day together and met for\r\ndinner, either at my quarters or in his beautiful Aladdin’s palace,\r\nevery evening.\r\n\r\nWe returned to Hong-kong on May Day. I found that the P. and O. Co. had\r\nput on an extra steamer, to start on Thursday the 4th, so I determined\r\nnot to wait for the mail, but to start for Shanghai without delay. This\r\nprevents me from making a trip to Macao, which is par excellence _the_\r\n“outing” from Hong-kong. But as the rainy season has begun in earnest,\r\nperhaps I do not lose much—at any rate, I shall leave my Hong-kong\r\nfriends with the utmost regret; their kindness and hospitality have\r\nknown no bounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               LETTER II\r\n\r\n\r\n                                          SHANGHAI, _10th May 1865_.\r\n\r\nThe _Ganges_ did not leave Hong-kong until the 5th at noon, and we\r\nanchored off the lightship in the estuary here on Monday night, but the\r\nriver is so difficult of navigation that we could not run into Shanghai\r\nuntil the next morning. We had on the whole a fine passage and a very\r\nquick one; C. and R., who were my companions at Canton, came on with\r\nme, and the captain of the ship being a very well-read, gentlemanlike\r\nman, sparing no pains to make every one comfortable, we had a very\r\ncheery voyage. We had besides a young French artillery officer on his\r\nway to revisit the scene of the campaign he had made in 1860, a few\r\nnondescripts, two or three Chinese families, and a Parsee. Of course\r\nthe Chinamen pigged together separately, and his “odium theologicum”\r\nforbade the Parsee to eat with us, which was a benefit to all parties,\r\nfor he was not a desirable companion by any means. The point of dirt\r\nat which the Chinese passengers contrived to arrive during the voyage,\r\nand the whiffs which came from their cabins when the doors were opened,\r\nsurpass belief; one of their great gentlemen here stood over the\r\nFrench officer and myself as we were playing backgammon one day, and\r\nmanifested the utmost interest in the game, uttering exclamations at\r\nevery lucky throw, for the Chinese are gamblers to the backbone,—but\r\nso noisome was he that we had to leave off playing and rush on deck\r\nfor fresh air. This being the condition of a “gentleman,” fancy how\r\npleasant the 110 coolie passengers under the forecastle were to sight\r\nand smell. The Chinese ladies did not show at all, but they used to\r\nsend their dirty little brats up on deck to play, and very offensive\r\nthey contrived to make their small selves. Independently of their\r\ndirt, Chinamen are a sorry spectacle on a journey—their heads require\r\nshaving (a week’s crop looks even worse on the poll than on the chin),\r\nand their tails get untidy and shaggy from being slept upon. Talking\r\nof tails, it seems to be the “chic” at Shanghai to lengthen them\r\nwith white instead of black silk, which does not look near so well. I\r\nnoticed one man who, like little Cock Robin, had “tied up his tail with\r\na yard of blue bobbin.” (I found out afterwards that these white and\r\nblue tails are signs of mourning.)\r\n\r\nThe voyage from Hong-kong to the north, being principally a coasting\r\naffair, is not so dull and uneventful as more sea-going cruises. We\r\nwere constantly in sight of land—numberless headlands and islands\r\nmark the course, but render it dangerous in bad weather. There are\r\nplenty of ships to be seen, and all around the rocky islands the sea\r\nis alive with fishing-smacks, their crews busily at work. We had no\r\nmails on board, nor stern officers in charge, so the captain stopped\r\nonce and bought a quantity of fresh fish, delicious pomfret all alive\r\nand kicking, paying the fishermen in kind with ship’s biscuit, which I\r\nhope was as great a boon to them as their fish was to us. It is such a\r\nfine sight in one of these narrow island passages, where one can almost\r\nhear the sea dashing against the basaltic rocks on either side, to pass\r\na great sailing-ship close on our lee, and steam away from her at top\r\nspeed. Long before the estuary is reached, the sea, which in these\r\nparts is of a deep aquamarine green, becomes clouded and discoloured.\r\nThis is owing to the immense volume of yellow dirty water which the\r\nYang-tse-kiang pours down. It is much the same colour as the Rhine, and\r\nquite as foul-looking.\r\n\r\nWe began ascending the river soon after daybreak on Tuesday morning.\r\nIts banks are low and flat. If it were not for a few trees there would\r\nbe nothing to relieve the eye from the monotony of the filthy water and\r\nvast plain. Here and there a group of European houses and an ensign\r\nor two mark a settlement. By eleven o’clock we had threaded our way\r\nthrough the labyrinth of shipping and had reached Shanghai. I landed\r\nat once and heard of an opportunity for Tientsing on Friday next, of\r\nwhich I shall avail myself. By the way, I must tell you here, that so\r\nfar as I can learn, the communications between Tientsing and this place\r\nare somewhat uncertain, so if any mail should not carry a letter to you\r\nfrom me, do not pay me the compliment of being uneasy, but let no news\r\nbe good news.\r\n\r\nMy good quarters and the kind hospitality which I had met with at\r\nHong-kong seem to follow me on my travels. Here again I have been\r\nreceived with the warmest welcome by Mr. D., a junior partner of C.’s,\r\nand I am assured of the same at Tientsing. If all the travellers and\r\nofficers stationed in China, whom I have met, did not tell me that this\r\nhospitality is the universal rule, I should be almost shy of accepting\r\nso much kindness.\r\n\r\nI have little enough to tell you about Shanghai. The city is ugly and\r\nunattractive, the river dingy, and the country a dead level plain.\r\nFrom the top of the club-house the view in every direction is utterly\r\nunbroken, there is not a mound the height of dear old Salt Hill. Then,\r\ncommercially speaking, the town at the time of my visit was a blank.\r\nThe crisis of which I have spoken to you before has told here more\r\nthan elsewhere; to my eye the harbour seems full enough of shipping,\r\nbut I am told that there are not more than a third of the vessels that\r\nused to be seen in former years. One of the causes which has brought\r\nabout this effect has been the speculation in land. When the rebellion\r\npanic was upon the Chinese they were only too glad to flock into the\r\nsettlement for shelter; land rose in value, and was bought up in every\r\ndirection. Now that the revolt has been put down in this part of the\r\nempire the natives have gone home to their own abodes, and of course\r\nlanded property has fallen, so that those speculators who did not sell\r\nin time have their money hopelessly tied up. This, and the competition\r\nsystem practised by the Europeans in contrast to the Chinese, who do\r\neverything by combination, together with “hard times,” have brought\r\nShanghai very low. In short, morally as well as physically, it is, for\r\nthe present, flat.\r\n\r\nI have had a good deal of conversation with Sir Harry Parkes, our\r\nconsul here. You will recollect him as famous for the pluck he showed\r\nwhen he and Loch were taken prisoners in Peking; he is one of the great\r\nauthorities in China, and one of our ablest officers in the East. He\r\ntells me that he considers the state of feeling between the Chinese and\r\nEuropeans in this part as on the whole satisfactory; that the natives\r\nhave begun to accept us and our trade as a necessity; to use his own\r\nexpression, it is a sort of husband and wife arrangement, with slight\r\nincompatibilities of temper on both sides. Sir Harry Parkes is a man of\r\nextraordinary determination and energy; his knowledge of the Chinese\r\nlanguage, customs, and character have given him an immense influence\r\nover the natives. He is in every way a remarkable man, and great things\r\nare expected of him, even by those who differ from him in opinion. It\r\nis only fair to say, that there are many men of judgment and experience\r\nout here who do not agree with him in holding that our trade with China\r\nstands on a solid footing. They consider that the unwilling spirit with\r\nwhich the natives first received us has by no means died out, and that\r\nlittle by little, always by fair means and without violence,[4] for\r\nthey know our strength, the Chinese will endeavour to oust us from our\r\nposition, and return to their traditional conservatism. Perhaps this is\r\na pessimist creed, but still it is largely professed. At any rate the\r\nChinese will find it a hard matter to get rid of us, for no Government\r\nwill give up a matter of nearly six millions of revenue without a\r\nstruggle. For the present the British are welcome here. The Ta̔i Pi̔ngs\r\nhave been driven out of this part of China, and the rebellion has\r\ndwindled down to comparative unimportance. The Chinese may be given\r\ncredit for so much of gratitude as looks upon past benefits as earnests\r\nof future favours. We can still be useful, so we are still courted. It\r\nremains to be seen whether, when we shall have played our part out, our\r\nfriends will try to cast us on one side.\r\n\r\nWhen Sir Rutherford Alcock was in authority here he established a\r\nmunicipal system which so long as Shanghai was prosperous answered very\r\nwell; of course, however, this being Chinese territory, subscription\r\nto the authority of the municipality could not be compulsory, nor were\r\nits enactments binding; but it suited the interests of the public to\r\naccept it, and so it was supported by all the respectable part of the\r\ncommunity. Now the failures have told upon this as upon every other\r\ninstitution, and unless better times come, it will fall to the ground\r\nfor want of funds and strength. It would be a great pity that this\r\nshould be the case, for there are many improvements needed here; above\r\nall, gas-lighting. It is really to be hoped that things will take a\r\nbetter turn soon, for they seem to be quite at their worst.\r\n\r\nI must tell you of rather a funny offer of service that I received the\r\nother day. R.’s Chinese boy came into me, and after playing nervously\r\nwith his tail for a little while, said, “My massa talkee my too muchee\r\nfooloo; my thinkee more better my walkee Peking side long you.” I felt\r\nhalf-inclined to engage the man for his simplicity, especially as he is\r\na good servant, though certainly not over bright.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                         _11th May._\r\n\r\nI have just been to see my berth on board the _Yuen-tse-Fee_, a private\r\nsteamer. She is to stop at Chihfu. I have a cabin to myself, a piece of\r\ngood luck which I have enjoyed ever since Galle. In about a week hence\r\nI expect to be at Peking. We sail at three in the morning to-morrow,\r\nso I must go on board this evening. The _Yuen-tse-Fee_ is a very tiny\r\ncraft; nothing big can get up the Peiho, so if it blows at all shan’t\r\nwe just pitch about!\r\n\r\nWe are expecting the mail in hourly, but I hope to reach Peking before\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               LETTER III\r\n\r\n\r\n                                           Ship _Yuen-tse-Fee_,\r\n                                             In the Gulf of Pechili,\r\n                                               _15th May 1865_.\r\n\r\nI daresay you will understand that I was rather melancholy at leaving\r\nShanghai. For the first time on all this long journey I was to set out\r\nalone, and my hosts, although they were only recent acquaintances, had\r\nbeen so kind to me that I felt as if I were leaving old friends. I took\r\nleave of them at half-past eleven on Thursday night, 11th May, for as\r\nthe ship was to sail at three in the morning I had to sleep on board.\r\nThe harbour was dark and gloomy, and it was as much as I could do to\r\nsteer the six-oared gig by the dim light of the lanterns at the various\r\nmasts’ heads. In short, everything looked black and dismal, and I felt\r\nvery much like going back to school after the holidays; but it don’t\r\ndo to give in, and very soon after I got on board I was sleeping as\r\nsound as the rats in my cabin and bed, and an army of mosquitoes which\r\nhad flocked on board, would let me. When I woke next morning we were\r\nhard and fast aground in the estuary; a thick fog had come on in the\r\nnight, and the captain, missing his course, had run upon one of the\r\nmany treacherous shoals of the great river. The tide took us off again\r\nat about eleven, and we went on without further accident.\r\n\r\nI had one fellow-passenger, an officer of the purveyor’s department of\r\nthe army, on his road to Peking to seek employment under the Imperial\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nWe had a strong head wind against us at first and very dirty weather\r\non Friday night. But in spite of wind and weather the little\r\n_Yuen-tse-Fee_ justified her name, which a Chinaman interpreted for me\r\nas “walkee all the same Fly,” and she kept up a good average of eight\r\nknots and a half.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday morning we were off the Shantung promontory, a fine broad\r\nheadland with a rough, jagged outline. Notwithstanding the haziness\r\nof the atmosphere we had a good view of the coast and of the Rocky\r\nIslands which make this sea so dangerous. Passing Cape Cod, we left\r\nto the westward the spot where the unlucky _Race Horse_ was lost, and\r\narrived at Chihfu at about five o’clock the same evening.\r\n\r\nFor a town which really has some little commercial importance, Chihfu\r\nis certainly one of the most wretched dens I ever saw. It consists\r\nof one long narrow street of untidy stone and brick houses, the\r\npeculiarity of which is that they have no apparent front or back, so\r\nthat it is a mystery how the inhabitants get into or out of them. Two\r\nor three European houses, the office of the Chinese officer of Customs,\r\na few godowns more or less empty, and here and there a hovel built\r\nup of mud, seaweed, and bamboo matting, complete the town. Its only\r\nornaments are the flags of the consul and of the Chinese officer. It\r\nis prettily situated at the foot of a range of low, but picturesquely\r\ntossed-about hills, and the harbour with its fleet of junks and\r\nships looks very well from the town. The type of the inhabitants is\r\ndifferent from that of the southern Chinese, the Tartar features are\r\nvery prominent among them, and it seemed to me that they were stronger\r\nand finer men. I certainly never saw a better boat’s crew than the\r\nsix men who rowed me on shore. Whether they would have the pluck to\r\n“stay” against an English crew I cannot say, but their short spurt was\r\nadmirable.\r\n\r\nIn spite of its mean appearance there is sufficient trade carried\r\non at Chihfu to induce some seventy Europeans to reside there. It\r\nis, moreover, likely to become popular as a sea-bathing resort and\r\nsanatorium.\r\n\r\nIn former days it was a great port for the junks, and there are still\r\nmany of them running there; but the junk trade has been very much\r\nknocked on the head by foreign ships and steamers, which the Chinese\r\nsee the advantage of chartering, although they continue to build their\r\nown clumsy and unwieldy craft. The principal exports of Chihfu are peas\r\nand bean cake, and a little manufactured silk; there is besides a small\r\nimport trade of shirtings and opium.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                         _17th May._\r\n\r\nThe best part of Monday was occupied in discharging our cargo, and we\r\ndid not get up steam until five o’clock. A strong wind had sprung\r\nup from the north-west, and the harbour, which is very much exposed\r\non that side, gave signs and tokens which led us to expect a very\r\nsqually night outside; however, the wind dropped suddenly and gave\r\nplace to a thick fog, so we escaped being tossed about, at the expense\r\nof a few alarms of running on to the rocks; which is not at all a\r\npleasant look-out, for even if our lives would not have been in actual\r\ndanger, there was the certainty that if we had struck a rock we should\r\nhave lost all our baggage, and passed a very uncomfortable night.\r\nWe took up another passenger at Chihfu, an interpreter, bound for\r\nTientsing—apparently a very popular gentleman, for the captain had to\r\nturn out neck and crop a company of friends who had come to see him\r\noff, and who were inclined to prolong that ceremony, which involves\r\nmuch sherry and brandy drinking, until long past the hour fixed for our\r\ndeparture.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday morning we took up our pilot for the Peiho River. He\r\nreported having come across a junk wrecked and without masts—all\r\nhands had evidently been lost; and on fishing about the cabin with a\r\nboat-hook in order to get the papers if possible, he found two or three\r\ndead bodies in a fearful state of decomposition. It is supposed that\r\nshe must have been wrecked more than a month ago.\r\n\r\nWe are absolutely suffering from cold here. The thermometer is 55°\r\nin my cabin—a serious contrast after the 90° and 95° I have been\r\naccustomed to. My warmer clothes are in the hold, so I am forced to\r\nwear a greatcoat. We expect to find it warmer at Tientsing.\r\n\r\nIt was late in the afternoon on Tuesday when we arrived at the entrance\r\nof the River Peiho.\r\n\r\nHere are the famous Taku Forts, the scene of the disaster of 1859,\r\nwhen Sir Frederick Bruce went up to get the treaty ratified, and our\r\nvessels were beaten back with the loss of two gunboats, which were\r\nsunk. The two forts stand on either side of the mouth of the river, and\r\nare occupied—that on the north by the French, and that on the south by\r\nthe English. A company of infantry suffices to garrison each. They are\r\nabout to be evacuated. A little to the east of the British Fort there\r\nstill lies one of our sunken gunboats; the Chinese have recovered and\r\nappropriated her guns. I cannot conceive a more dismal lot than that\r\nof garrisoning Taku. Besides the forts, which in themselves are dreary\r\nenough, there are but a few Chinese mud huts and an hotel, principally\r\npatronised by pilots; and the French are cut off even from these by the\r\nPeiho, than which no more filthy little stream ever defiled a sea. Its\r\nbanks at the mouth are vast plains of mud, lying flush with the water,\r\nand so bleak and sad-looking that one almost wonders that the very\r\nwild-fowl should be induced to stop there. Mud forts, mud houses, mud\r\nfields, and muddy river—everything is mud.\r\n\r\nHigher up stream, although the banks are very flat and uninteresting,\r\nthere is no lack of verdure. The trees are insignificant, but there are\r\ngreen fields and gardens cultivated with vegetables and fruit-trees.\r\nThe neighbourhood of Tientsing is said to be the garden of China, and\r\nin the season a peach only fetches three cash, of which one thousand or\r\nmore, according to the exchange, go to make up the dollar.\r\n\r\nWe soon had an experience of the difficulty of navigating the Peiho,\r\nwhich is no broader than the Thames at Eton, and as tortuous as Cuckoo\r\nweir. Over and over again we were on the point of running aground, and\r\nwhen on one occasion we did stick, it was a labour of great difficulty\r\nto get off again. A boat’s crew had to be landed, and a line fastened\r\nto a stout tree on the bank, by which means and by backing with all our\r\nforce we floated off, the sailors on shore improving the occasion by\r\nstealing onions and vegetables from the gardens on the bank. Nor was\r\nthe shallowness of the water our only impediment, for we did not reach\r\nTientsing without several brushes and collisions with junks, in one of\r\nwhich our screw was broken.\r\n\r\nI found Tientsing in a great state of excitement. It was the last day\r\nof the races, and to my great joy I found my colleague Saurin staying\r\nat the Russian consulate. Of course we agreed to make the journey\r\nto Peking together, and the Russian consul, by way of making things\r\npleasant, most kindly volunteered to put me up.\r\n\r\nThe races really showed some very good sport. Tientsing cannot boast\r\nof such a meeting as those of Hong-kong and Shanghai, where English\r\nthoroughbreds are run, and for which such horses as “Buckstone,” since\r\ndead, and “Sir William” are imported; the horses are but Mongol ponies,\r\nthe _bona fide_ hacks of their owners and riders, yet they accomplished\r\nthe three-mile race in seven minutes and forty seconds. They are very\r\nplucky, strong little beasts, and run till they drop. The races were\r\nan additional stroke of luck for me, for I was able at the end of the\r\nday to buy a capital pony for fifty dollars. The Chinese crowd showed\r\nthe greatest possible interest in all the proceedings, and the course\r\nhad to be kept _vi et flagellis_, which latter were not spared by\r\nthe native police. Perhaps they feared spoiling the Chinaman, who is\r\nproverbially a child.\r\n\r\n                                                         _19th May._\r\n\r\nI must own that I was agreeably disappointed in Tientsing. So many\r\ntravellers have abused it, and inveighed against its filth and its\r\nbeggarly crowd, that I expected to be shocked in one or other of my\r\nsenses at every step. It certainly is very dirty, but not much more so\r\nthan other Chinese towns, or, for that matter, than many in Europe;\r\nand who that has travelled in the sunny South has not seen rags and\r\ntatters, vermin, foul diseases, and deformities paraded as stimulants\r\nto charity? There is one drawback to Tientsing which is really\r\ninsufferable. All the wells are salt, and the inhabitants are obliged\r\nto drink the loathsome water of the river. In order to cleanse it, it\r\nis first placed in large jars that the impurities may settle at the\r\nbottom, and then filtered. But nothing can purge it so as to convince\r\none that the disgusting matter, which forces itself upon one as one\r\nsails up the stream, has been entirely got rid of.\r\n\r\nWe went to see some of the curiosity shops. There was a great deal\r\nof porcelain to which the dealers and local connoisseurs assigned\r\nwonderful dates and fine titles, but nothing that would be cared for\r\nin England; and the prices were simply outrageous, for the merchants\r\nwill pay any mad sum that is asked by the rascally dealers. There were\r\nsome very fine specimens of cloisonné enamel, but if the sums demanded\r\nfor the porcelain were high, the enamels were ten times dearer. I saw a\r\nquantity of Chinese picture-books; they were not fit to buy, although\r\nsome had great merit for delicacy of drawing. They each represented\r\na story, generally the “Harlot’s Progress,” from a Chinese point of\r\nview, very coarse, and without Hogarth’s grim retribution at the end.\r\nOf course, where such drawings are openly exposed for sale there is\r\nno great strictness of morals, and Tientsing is famous, or rather\r\ninfamous, even in China, for every bestial and degrading vice.\r\n\r\nThe European settlement of Tientsing is about two miles distant from\r\nthe Chinese city. There are some fairly good houses built by the side\r\nof a broad bund or quay, and they command fabulous rents. The same\r\nmunicipal system which obtains at Shanghai has been established here;\r\nand, on the whole, the community shows signs of prosperity, although\r\nthe port has been a disappointment to those who expected that it would\r\nreach an importance such as to crush Shanghai and its other rivals, or,\r\nat all events, to divert a considerable portion of their trade. For the\r\nfirst year or two after its establishment the business done was very\r\ngreat, and large fortunes were made; one merchant, for example, is just\r\nretiring with a fortune of £5000 a year, accumulated since 1861. But\r\nthe Chinese, cunning in trade, very soon found out that it answered\r\ntheir purpose better to charter steamers, and have consignments made\r\nto themselves directly, than to buy from the agents of the great\r\nhouses; consequently, as the trade is entirely import, the Europeans\r\nare finding less and less to do. The _Yuen-tse-Fee_, although she hails\r\nfrom Glasgow, and is nominally owned by Messrs. Trautmann and Co., a\r\nGerman firm, is in reality chiefly, if not entirely, the property of a\r\ndirty little Chinese comprador, whom I saw, and to whom the whole of\r\nher cargo was consigned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               LETTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\n                                            PEKING, _23rd May 1865_.\r\n\r\nWe left Tientsing early on Friday morning the 19th, by which means we\r\nhad the tide in our favour, and were able to get quicker clear of the\r\nhideous sights and smells of the river as it runs through the town. We\r\neach had a boat; Saurin’s was the drawing-room, mine the dining-room,\r\nand his servant occupied the third as kitchen. They were capital roomy\r\nboats, covered in with hoods of bamboo and rattan matting, and with a\r\nsort of dresser in each upon which we spread our beds. Each had a crew\r\nof three men, and in Saurin’s, which was the biggest, there was a boy\r\nbesides. They were very cheery, hard-working fellows, and indeed they\r\nhad no sinecure, for although the wind was ostensibly in our favour,\r\nstill the river winds round such sharp twists and elbows that in every\r\nother reach it was dead against us, and we had to proceed laboriously\r\nby dint of towing and punting. But the harder they worked the better\r\nhumoured the crew seemed to be, and the boy especially distinguished\r\nhimself by zeal equalling that of an unpaid attaché. The shoals are\r\ninnumerable, and we were constantly crossing the river backwards and\r\nforwards, along a course marked out by twigs stuck in the mud. There\r\nis no scenery to enjoy, nothing but interminable fields of millet, and\r\nhere and there a little wood. There is not a hillock to be seen, and\r\nwe were lucky in being as short a time as possible over what must be\r\na very dull journey. We reached Tungchou at three o’clock on Sunday\r\nafternoon. Here we found our horses, with an escort which had been sent\r\ndown with them to meet us.\r\n\r\nTungchou was very busy. A fleet of junks had come in with grain, and\r\nthe quay was alive with crowds of coolies, many of them as naked as\r\nthey were born, discharging cargo, sifting corn, and carrying it into\r\ngranaries. Our appearance produced some astonishment, for “foreign\r\ndevils” are hardly yet quite familiar objects so far north. Tungchou\r\nwas the place where the unfortunate English prisoners were taken\r\nin 1860, and where Wade and Crealock, carrying a flag of truce and\r\ndemanding to parley with the commander, were fired upon and narrowly\r\nescaped with their lives. It is fortified, as all the northern cities\r\nare, but its walls would only be a security against native warriors.\r\nThe roads in this part of the world are miracles of badness, and it\r\nis not difficult to conceive the tortures that the English prisoners\r\nmust have suffered when they were conveyed along them in native carts\r\nwithout springs, and having their hands and heels tied together behind\r\nthem with cords tightened by water. Every inch of the road to Peking\r\nis famous from the events of that time. Some way outside Tungchou we\r\nrode over the bridge of Palikao,[5] where the Chinese crossed their\r\nspears with the French bayonets, and held their own for half an hour.\r\nFrom this bridge the Général de Montauban takes his title. Its kylins\r\nand stone flags still bear traces of shot and shell. Riding through\r\ndust over one’s pony’s hocks, and raising a cloud at every step, is\r\nvery dry work, and I was glad when we struck off the main road, and,\r\ncoming upon a tea-house in a shady nook, stopped to rest and refresh.\r\nThe people received us with the utmost _bonhomie_ and civility, and\r\nbrought us delicious tea, without milk or sugar, in bowls, hard-boiled\r\neggs, and a sort of roll-twist fried instead of baked. We soon had\r\nten or twelve yellow gentlemen round us, eagerly asking all sorts of\r\nquestions about ourselves, our ages, and belongings. Murray talks\r\nChinese fluently, and Saurin has also some knowledge of it, so we got\r\non capitally. Our ages always puzzle Chinamen. They neither wear beard\r\nnor moustache until they have reached the age of forty, so they think\r\nthat all Europeans who wear such appendages must have passed that age.\r\nA single eye-glass is, however, the possession which commands the most\r\nastonishment. They are familiar with spectacles and double eye-glasses,\r\nfor they themselves wear them of portentous size, and mounted in thick\r\nbrass or tortoise-shell rims. But a single glass is indeed a marvel,\r\nand provokes much laughter. Though the peculiarities of foreigners\r\namuse the Chinese as much as theirs do us, it is singular how their\r\nnatural courtesy prevents their showing it in the offensive manner\r\nthat every Englishman has experienced in some foreign countries. I\r\nhad expected to find the country on this side of Peking flat, ugly,\r\nand barren. Flat it certainly is, but there are plenty of trees and\r\nrich fields, and it cannot be called ugly. The villages and graves\r\nargue an immense population. It is not till one is under the very\r\nwalls of the town that one sees Peking. The walls are high, ruinous,\r\nbattlemented, and picturesque, of a fine deep gray colour. They are\r\ncapped at intervals by towers of fantastic Chinese architecture, and,\r\nwith their lofty gates, make a strange and striking picture. As a means\r\nof defence against modern artillery the walls of Peking are probably\r\nabsurd. However, before I tell you anything about Peking I had better\r\nknow something myself. At present I only know that I was very hot, very\r\ntired, and as dusty as the oldest press in the Record office, when I\r\nrode into the court of Her Majesty’s Legation, where I received the\r\nwarmest welcome from Wade, the _chargé d’affaires_.\r\n\r\nWe have received bad Chinese news. Sangkolinsin, the Mongol chief\r\nwho commanded at the Peiho in 1859, and was temporarily disgraced for\r\nnot being able to beat off the allies in 1860, has been killed by\r\nthe rebels in the province of Shantung, some 400 miles hence. He was\r\nreputed a brave soldier and an honest man. Although the Chinese affect\r\nto disregard the importance of the intelligence, there is no doubt that\r\nit is very serious. The fire is burning everywhere, and they cannot or\r\nwill not take the proper means to put it out.\r\n\r\n  _Note._—I should wish to add here one word of admiration and respect\r\n  for the memory of Sir Thomas Wade, my first chief in China. He had\r\n  been Lord Clyde’s adjutant, but gave up the army for diplomacy. A\r\n  great student and master of many languages, his Chinese scholarship\r\n  won the admiration even of the learned mandarins with whom he had\r\n  to deal. During the two Chinese Wars he distinguished himself, not\r\n  only by his great abilities as a negotiator, but also by the most\r\n  dauntless courage. Generous and self-sacrificing to a fault, he was\r\n  one of the greatest gentlemen I ever met.—1900.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                LETTER V\r\n\r\n\r\n                                            PEKING, _1st June 1865_.\r\n\r\nWhen Wade was in England last year Lord Stanley said to him: “Peking’s\r\na gigantic failure, isn’t it? not a two-storied house in the whole\r\nplace, eh?” To Lord Stanley’s practical eye, no doubt, it might be a\r\nfailure, but an artist would find much to admire and put on paper.\r\n\r\nPe-king, which means the northern capital, as Nan-king means the\r\nsouthern, consists of two cities, the Chinese and the Tartar, and\r\nwithin this latter, again, is the Imperial city, which contains the\r\npalace and precincts of the court. Both cities are surrounded by walls\r\nof dark-gray brick; those of the Tartar city are fifty feet high, forty\r\nfeet wide at the top, and about sixty feet below; the walls of the\r\nChinese city are less important, being only thirty feet high. These\r\nwalls have battlements and loop-holes for guns. That of the Chinese\r\ncity has fallen into decay, but that of the Tartar is more carefully\r\nrepaired. At intervals are lofty watch-towers standing out against\r\nthe sky. High towers stand also above the gates, which are closed at\r\nsunset, after which time ingress and egress are forbidden.\r\n\r\nThe streets are broad roads, in most cases unpaved, and in all uncared\r\nfor. They are flanked on each side by shops and low houses, but their\r\nbreadth is lessened by the countless stalls and stands of hucksters of\r\nall sorts that take them up often in quadruple rows. In this region of\r\ndust and dirt the streets are equally filthy summer and winter. Both in\r\nthe Chinese and Tartar cities there are large open spaces and buildings\r\nstanding in their own grounds, covering areas of many acres. In the\r\nformer city these are the temples of the Buddhist and Taoist religions,\r\nin the latter they are the palaces of the Emperor and persons of\r\ndistinction. These grounds, planted as they are with lofty trees, give\r\na great beauty to the town, and often in the heart of either city\r\nthere are spots which are pictures of village life. Standing among\r\nthese groves of trees the brilliant colours and fantastic designs\r\nof the Chinese architecture have a wonderfully pleasing effect. The\r\nwall of the imperial palace, covered with highly glazed yellow tiles,\r\nwith towers at the corners shining like gold in the sun, is especially\r\nstriking. Whichever way one turns there is something grotesque and\r\nbarbarous to be seen, and the signs of decay and rot do not detract\r\nfrom the picture. In fact Peking is like a vast curiosity shop, with\r\nall the dust and dirt which are among the conditions of bric-à-brac. It\r\nwould be pleasant-looking and admiring were it not for the difficulties\r\nof riding through the city owing to the enormous crowds which block\r\nthe way—carts, porters, camels, chairs, pedlars, beggars, lamas,\r\nmuleteers, horse-copers from Mongolia, archers on horseback, mandarins\r\nwith their suites, small-footed women, great ladies in carts, closely\r\nveiled to keep off the gaze of the profane vulgar. In short, every\r\nvariety of yellow and brown humanity, not to speak of dogs and pigs,\r\nget into one’s path at every moment, and raise clouds of dust, which\r\nfill eyes, ears, hair, mouth, and nose, and temporarily destroy every\r\nsense save that of touch. It is as if the dust of all the Derby days\r\nsince the institution of that race (by the bye I wonder what horse\r\nhas won it this year) had been borne by the winds to find a permanent\r\nhome here. A dust-storm in the north of China is a natural phenomenon.\r\nClouds draw over the sky as if a thunderstorm was going to burst. In\r\nmy inexperience the first time I saw this I expected rain to fall, but\r\ninstead of rain there came a fine dust penetrating everything and not\r\nto be shut out by door or window. This nuisance, which comes to us from\r\nthe great Mongolian deserts, besides hurting the eyes as common dust\r\nby filling them with extraneous matter, has chemical properties which\r\nproduce a smarting and burning pain. Dust-storms are sometimes so thick\r\nthat men lose their way as in a London fog. It is indeed “a darkness\r\nthat may be felt.”\r\n\r\nThe distance round the walls of Peking is something like twenty-three\r\nmiles, of which fifteen must be given to the Tartar city, which is\r\nsquare in shape and lies to the north of the oblong Chinese city.\r\nTradition, and the mystery which for so many years hung over the\r\ncapital, have assigned to it an exaggerated population. The Chinese\r\naffected to believe it contained two million souls, and that no\r\ncapital in the world could compete with it. This may have been the case\r\nin the time of the Emperor Chien-Lung, who reigned from 1736 to 1795\r\na.d. But nowadays, judging from the enormous empty spaces, and from\r\nthe gardens and courtyards, which no gentleman’s residence is without,\r\nand even allowing for the dense crowding of some quarters, it probably\r\ndoes not reach a million. It is impossible to form any precise estimate\r\nof the numbers of the “Doors and Mouths.” Doctors disagree, and I\r\nhave heard the people of Peking reckoned at various figures, from six\r\nhundred thousand to a million and a half. Until Peking was opened to\r\nEuropeans the southern Chinese used to stick at no lie about it. For\r\ninstance, if they were told of some great scientific invention such as\r\nrailways, the electric telegraph, or the like, they would say at once\r\nwith the utmost coolness, “Have seen! Have seen! Have got plenty Peking\r\nside!” And in like manner they lied about its size and population.\r\nThe country round about Peking seems to be very thickly peopled. I\r\nwas prepared to find it so, but nevertheless I had hardly expected\r\nto see so many human beings and their traces, which are often very\r\nunpleasant, especially in China.\r\n\r\nOur Legation is situated in the southern part of the Tartar city.\r\nWe occupy a most picturesque palace called the Liang Kung Fu, or\r\nPalace of the Duke of Liang, which, like all Chinese buildings of\r\nimportance, covers an immense space of ground. There are courtyards\r\nupon courtyards, huge empty buildings with red pillars, used as covered\r\ncourts, state approaches guarded by two great marble lions, and a\r\nnumber of houses with only a ground floor, each of us inhabiting one\r\nto himself. When the Legation first came to live here the whole place\r\nwas put into repair, and redecorated in the Chinese fashion with fluted\r\nroofs of many colours, carved woodwork, kylins of stone and pottery,\r\nand all the thousand and one fancies with which the Chinese cover their\r\nbuildings. Unfortunately the repairs were badly executed, and nothing\r\nfurther has been done to keep matters straight, so the Legation, which\r\nought to be as pretty as possible, is really a disgrace to us. The\r\ngardens are a wilderness, the paving of the courts is broken, the\r\nwalls are tumbling down, and the beautiful place is going to rack\r\nand ruin. In this climate of extreme heat and cold a stitch in time\r\nsaves ninety-nine.[6] Fancy a residence in the heart of a great and\r\npopulous city where foxes, scorpions, polecats, weasels, magpies, and\r\nother creatures that one expects to find in the wild country, abound.\r\nThat will give you an idea of how space is wasted in Peking. The great\r\ndrawback to our palace is its situation. We have more than an hour’s\r\nride before we can escape from the city and its stinks, to breathe a\r\nbreath of fresh air. It requires an immense exercise of energy to face\r\nan hour’s ride through the streets of Peking in order to get a canter\r\nin the open; and I am often half tempted to sell my pony and dismiss\r\nmy groom, but this would be tantamount to shutting myself up for good\r\nin the Legation, for walking at Peking is even more disagreeable than\r\nriding.\r\n\r\nHis Imperial Highness the Prince of Kung, President of the Council,\r\nChief of the Board of Foreign Affairs, Prime Minister, and what not\r\nbesides, sent his card yesterday to announce to Wade that he would pay\r\nhim an official visit. I enclose you his visiting card.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Kung is the brother of the late Emperor, and in 1860 was\r\nentrusted by him with the negotiations with Lord Elgin and Baron Gros.\r\nDuring the minority of the present Emperor, who is about twelve years\r\nold, the two Empresses-dowager[7] are nominally regents; but the Prince\r\nhas the care of the Emperor’s education, and is virtually the regent of\r\nthe empire. He was very nearly meeting with the fate of Humpty-Dumpty\r\na little while back, for he was accused of selling places, abuse of\r\npatronage, and insolence in the Presence. His accuser was supposed to\r\nhave been instigated by one of the Empresses who is hostile to him,\r\nand to have been made cat’s-paw of by a court intrigue. However that\r\nmay be, the Empresses issued an edict in the style of the chorus in\r\nthe _Agamemnon_ which shows how prosperity leads to insolence, and\r\ninsolence to retribution, and the Prince was deprived of all his\r\noffices and glories. For a few days he remained in disgrace, but his\r\nbrothers came to the rescue, a Grand Council was held, and the Prince\r\nwas reinstated in the office of Foreign Affairs in consideration of\r\nhis great services. This, however, did not look well for the Prince,\r\nas the Ministry of Foreign Affairs carries with it such unpopularity\r\nthat its possession alone might be esteemed a doubtful pleasure; and it\r\nwas not until his former honours were one by one restored to him that\r\nhe could be said to be reinstated in court favour. The charges against\r\nhim were declared unfounded, and it was agreed that the question of\r\ninsolence was a family matter, and should not interfere with public\r\naffairs. Meanwhile his accuser goes about at large, but about as free\r\nas a mouse that a cat lets slip out of her claws for a second or two. I\r\nwould not be in his skin for something.\r\n\r\nA little before the hour fixed for the Prince’s visit, Hêng-Chi and\r\nTung, two of the Board of Foreign Affairs, arrived to meet him.\r\nHêng-Chi is the man whose name became known in Europe during the war in\r\n1860, and during Parke’s and Loch’s captivity. He is a little thin old\r\nman very like Mr. Meadows, the actor at the Princesses’ Theatre, and a\r\ngreat dandy. He wore a pearl gray silk dress turned up with blue. His\r\nfan-case, chopstick-case, and other knick-knacks which he wears at\r\nhis girdle, are richly embroidered, and mounted with seed pearls and a\r\npeculiar clouded pink coral which the Chinese call baby-face coral. His\r\nsnuff-bottle is of the finest Fei Tsui, or emerald green jade, which is\r\nworth its weight in diamonds here, but of all his possessions none is\r\nin his eyes more charming than a large silver Geneva turnip watch which\r\nhe displays with much pride. In his boot, which is of black satin, he\r\ncarries his pipe with its tiny silver bowl, and a gorgeous Fei Tsui\r\nmouthpiece, together with sweetmeats, pills, and other trifles. His\r\nwhite cap with the red tassel of office hanging all round it, has a\r\npink coral button (Hêng-Chi is a mandarin of the first button), and the\r\npeacock’s feather which falls from it is mounted in more Fei Tsui. To\r\ncrown all, he wears a pair of spectacles as big as saucers, with broad\r\nsilver rims. Never was a little old man so pleased with himself; his\r\nlittle airs and graces and _petit-maître_ ways are very funny. Tung is\r\na jolly, fat, old mandarin and a great contrast to Hêng-Chi. He is a\r\ngreat man of letters, and has translated Longfellow’s “Psalm of Life”\r\ninto Chinese verse. That is, Wade gave him a literal version of the\r\nEnglish, and he made a poem of it, which is said to have great merit.\r\n\r\nIn due course of time the Prince arrived in his chair attended by a\r\nnumber of running footmen, and an escort mounted on ponies. Wade and\r\nI received him, and I was presented to him as Mi-ta-jên, the official\r\nname by which my arrival was announced to the Chinese Foreign Office—we\r\nare all obliged to have monosyllabic names for our intercourse with the\r\nChinese. Sir F. Bruce was Pu-ta-jên (the Chinese cannot pronounce an\r\nR, so they rendered his name as Pu-lu-su), Wade is Wei-ta-jên. Ta-jên,\r\nliterally “great man,” is a title denoting official rank, and is that\r\nwhich is borne by the mandarins.\r\n\r\nThe Prince is a young man about 28 years of age, judging by\r\nappearances. He is pockmarked, as indeed is almost every Chinaman\r\nI have seen. He is very shortsighted, and has the same trick of\r\nscrewing up his eyes that I have, and I could not help thinking what\r\na caricature we should have made as we sat opposite each other making\r\nfaces. As soon as the Prince had taken his seat he drew his pipe out of\r\nhis boot, and one of his own attendants brought him fire, serving him\r\nkneeling on one knee. Tea was brought as a matter of course, and then\r\nthe conversation began. The great man had a short, flippant manner,\r\nand this it was that so nearly brought him to grief. He was immensely\r\namused by an English bell-pull, and a mother-of-pearl paper-knife which\r\nlay on the table. My single eyeglass was a real boon to the Prince.\r\nWhenever he was getting the worst of an argument, and was at a loss\r\nfor an answer, he would stop short, throw up his hands in amazement,\r\nand pointing at me cry out, “A single eyeglass! marvellous!” By thus\r\ncreating a diversion at my expense he gave himself time to consider\r\nhis reply. He seemed very friendly with Wade, and full of jokes and\r\nfun—of course I could not understand a word of what was said, but I\r\ntook refuge behind a big cigar, and looked on vastly amused by our\r\nguest’s ways. I thought I detected a cruel, cunning look behind all his\r\naffectation of good-humour.\r\n\r\nWhen the Prince had gone, Hêng-Chi, who, besides being part-Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs, is also a general officer, and many other things,\r\nfor pluralism is the order of the day, invited us to a review and\r\nbreakfast afterwards on the 3rd of June, at six in the morning.\r\n\r\nIt may be a calumny, but I strongly suspect Hêng-Chi of dyeing his tail.\r\n\r\n  _Note._—The senior Empress-dowager, who had been the first wife\r\n  of the Emperor Hsien Fêng, appears to have been more or less a\r\n  cypher. The real power was wielded by the Empress-mother Tsu Hsi.\r\n  This remarkable lady was according to some accounts a slave girl,\r\n  according to others the daughter of a member of the imperial family.\r\n  Nor are the two statements incompatible in a country where adoption\r\n  of children holds good. The Emperor wishing to raise a girl in his\r\n  harem to the highest position would only need to command one of his\r\n  relations to adopt her, and she would at once be an imperial princess\r\n  as much as if she had been born in the purple, or rather in the\r\n  yellow.\r\n\r\n  The senior Empress-dowager, or Eastern Empress as she was called,\r\n  died on 18th April 1881, and the power was then absolutely and solely\r\n  in the hands of the Empress-mother. The latter’s son, the Emperor\r\n  Tung Chi, had died without issue in 1875, and his cousin, a child of\r\n  four, was raised to the Lung Wei or Dragon’s throne in his stead. The\r\n  regency remained as before with the two Dowager-empresses.\r\n\r\n  Dr. Wells Williams, in his _Middle Kingdom_, a perfect encyclopædia\r\n  on all Chinese matters, says, “The Empress-dowager is the most\r\n  important subject within the palace, and His Majesty does homage\r\n  at frequent intervals, by making the highest ceremony of nine\r\n  prostrations before her. When the widow of Kia King reached the age\r\n  of sixty in 1836 many honours were conferred by the Emperor. An\r\n  extract from the ordinance issued on this festival will exhibit the\r\n  regard paid her by the Sovereign:—\r\n\r\n  “Our extensive dominions have enjoyed the utmost prosperity under\r\n  the shelter of a glorious and enduring state of felicity—our\r\n  exalted race has become most illustrious under the protection of\r\n  that honoured relative to whom the whole court looks up. To her\r\n  happiness, already unalloyed, the highest degree of felicity has\r\n  been super-added, causing joy and gladness to every inmate of the\r\n  Six Palaces. The grand ceremonies of the occasion shall exceed in\r\n  splendour the utmost requirements of the ancients in regard to the\r\n  human relations, calling forth the gratulation of the whole Empire.\r\n  It is indispensable that the observances of the occasion should be\r\n  of an exceedingly unusual nature, in order that our reverence for\r\n  our august parent and care of her may both be equally and gloriously\r\n  displayed.... In the first month of the present winter occurs the\r\n  sixtieth anniversary of Her Majesty’s sacred natal day. At the\r\n  opening of the happy period the sun and the moon shed their united\r\n  genial influences on it. When commencing anew the revolution of the\r\n  sexagenary cycle the honour thereof adds increase to her felicity.\r\n  Looking upward and beholding her glory, we repeat our gratulations,\r\n  and announce the event to heaven, to earth, to our ancestors, and\r\n  to the patron-gods of the empire. On the nineteenth day of the\r\n  tenth moon, in the fifteenth year of Tao Kwang, we will conduct\r\n  the princes, the nobles, and all the high officers, both civil\r\n  and military, into the presence of the great Empress, benign and\r\n  dignified, universally placid, thoroughly virtuous, tranquil, and\r\n  self-collected, in favours unbounded; and we will then present our\r\n  congratulations on the glad occasion, the anniversary of her natal\r\n  day. The occasion yields a happiness equal to what is enjoyed by\r\n  goddesses in heaven, and while announcing it to the gods and to our\r\n  people, we will tender to her blessings unbounded.”—_Middle Kingdom_,\r\n  vol. i. p. 410.\r\n\r\n  Rations to soldiers, honours, promotions, pardons, etc., were\r\n  ordered in honour of the day—“Every perfectly filial son or obedient\r\n  grandson, every upright husband or chaste wife, upon proofs being\r\n  brought forward, shall have a monument erected with an inscription\r\n  in his or her honour.” Soldiers who had reached the age of ninety\r\n  or one hundred received money to erect an honorary portal, and\r\n  tombs, temples, and bridges were ordered to be repaired; but, as Dr.\r\n  Williams slily remarks, “how many of these exceedingly great and\r\n  special favours were actually carried into effect cannot be stated.”\r\n\r\n  This edict of the Emperor Tao Kwang is of high interest at this\r\n  moment (1900), as illustrating the position of the present\r\n  Dowager-empress Tsu Hsi, which has seemed so incomprehensible to us\r\n  Westerns. An ambitious woman, with the master mind of an Elizabeth or\r\n  a Catherine, would, it is easy to perceive, find opportunities which\r\n  she has certainly turned to the best, or worst, advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                         _4th June._\r\n\r\nI wished my friend General Hêng-Chi with all his soldiers a long way\r\noff when my boy came to pull me out of bed at daybreak yesterday\r\nmorning. We had had a great storm the night before, so the dust was\r\nlaid, but _en revanche_ the streets were a sea of mud, and many of\r\nthem regular rivers, and we had to flounder on, our horses putting\r\ntheir feet in holes at every step. It took us nearly an hour and a\r\nhalf of this work to get to the parade ground on the Anting plain.\r\nThe ground was kept by means of sticks and red string, with a soldier\r\nat each stick. We were shown straight to a small blue tent, where the\r\ngeneral received us with much ceremony. When we had drunk tea the three\r\ngenerals, the Russian Embassy, and ourselves left the tent and took\r\nup our place on a small mound. Our appearance was the signal for the\r\nmilitary music to strike up. The band was composed of about twelve\r\nChinamen, and their instruments were large sea shells or conches, out\r\nof which they produced the most dismal and distressing and continuous\r\nhowl that it ever was my bad luck to listen to. I hardly know what to\r\ncompare it to. You have heard the noise in a shell—it was like that,\r\nbut magnified a million times. As soon as we had taken our position,\r\na soldier in front of us waved a huge flag, and the business of the\r\nday began. There were about two thousand soldiers, and they were to\r\nexercise, not with the swords, and bows, and shields of “the Braves,”\r\nbut according to our drill book, which Wade has translated for them,\r\nand with rifles and guns given them by the Russians. They went through\r\ntheir evolutions respectably, so said Wade, who is an old soldier and a\r\nfirst-rate drill; but I own that when they advanced close up to us and\r\ndelivered a volley bang in our faces, I felt that it was not unlikely\r\nthat, as at our Volunteer reviews, a stray ramrod might have been left\r\nin a rifle. However, no accident occurred, barring the bursting of the\r\npowder box of one of the big guns, by which four men were severely\r\nscorched and five put _hors de combat_, for the lieutenant in charge\r\nof the gun was then and there collared and summarily bambooed, _coram\r\npopulo_, for carelessness in giving the word to fire before the powder\r\nbox was closed. Such is discipline!\r\n\r\nThe sun was beginning to be very powerful, so it was a great relief\r\nwhen the review was declared to be over, and it was announced that each\r\nof the men was to receive three halfpence for his good conduct that day\r\nin the field. Upon the hearing of this joyful intelligence, the army to\r\na man went down on one knee, in token of gratitude, though they knew\r\nperfectly well that they never would see the money. Poor devils!\r\n\r\nBreakfast was served in a temple hard by. When we sat down Hêng-Chi was\r\nnot to be found. It turned out that, with a thoughtfulness which would\r\nhave done credit to many a more civilised host, he had gone to see that\r\nthe men of our and the Russian escorts were well cared for.\r\n\r\nA Chinese meal exactly reverses the order of the things which is\r\npractised in Europe. First came cups of tea, and when these were all\r\ncleared away two tiny saucers were placed before each person. Then the\r\ndessert and sweets were put upon the table; oranges, apples, candied\r\nwalnuts, sweets of all kinds, hemp seed done up with flour and sugar,\r\napricot kernels preserved in oil and dried, and other delicacies. Next\r\ncame the savoury meats—of these the most remarkable were sea-slugs,\r\nlike turtle-soup in taste, bamboo sprouts, sharks’ fins, and deers’\r\nsinews—all gelatinous dishes are the most highly prized; the famous\r\nbird’s-nest soup is just like isinglass not quite boiled down. Finally\r\ncame a sort of soup of rice. I found it very difficult at first to\r\neat with chopsticks. The manner of eating is to dip your chopsticks\r\ninto any one of the bowls, and transfer a morsel to your own saucers,\r\nwhich are not changed, neither are the chopsticks wiped, during the\r\nwhole proceeding. If you wish to pay a person a compliment, you select\r\na tit-bit with your own chopsticks and put it on your neighbour’s\r\nplate, and he does the same in return. This gives the entertainment\r\nthe appearance of an indecorous scramble, for one is continually\r\nleaning across two or three people to repay some civility. The dishes\r\nare very rich, and I should think unwholesome in the extreme. There\r\nwere upwards of sixty different eatables put upon the table, and I\r\nmust own that although my chopsticks went into nearly every little\r\nbowl, there was not one which did not please my taste. Native wine was\r\nserved to us in little cups of the size of our liqueur glasses; it\r\nhad rather a pleasant taste, and was very dry. As soon as breakfast\r\nwas over the Chinese gentlemen produced out of their boots—which seem\r\nan inexhaustible receptacle for everything, from tobacco to state\r\npapers—small pieces of paper, with which they wiped their mouths and\r\nivory chopsticks, and then came a piece of Chinese politeness which\r\nis very offensive to Europeans; for it is good manners here, out of\r\ncompliment to the host, and in token of having eaten well and been\r\nsatisfied, to produce the longest and loudest eructations, and Hêng-Chi\r\nand the two generals left nothing to be desired in that respect, making\r\na great display of good breeding. Tea and conversation in the court of\r\nthe temple brought my first Chinese entertainment to a close. I can’t\r\ntell you how strange it seemed to me to begin with dessert and end\r\nwith soup!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               LETTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\n                                           PEKING, _23rd June 1865_.\r\n\r\nSince I wrote to you last I have neither seen nor done anything worth\r\nrecording. The thermometer has been standing at from 95° to 107° in our\r\ncourtyard, so there is not much temptation to go sight-seeing, or even\r\nto move outside the Legation; inside, the days are as like as twins.\r\nHowever, there is a bag going to-day, so I must try and patch up a\r\nletter.\r\n\r\nWe are thinking of making a move to the hills next Monday; we have\r\nalmost decided on a temple called Pi Yün Ssŭ, about 12½ miles from\r\nthis. I shall be very glad to go, for the town is becoming abominably\r\nstuffy and hot, and the dust is something beyond belief. We shall\r\nprobably stay six weeks or two months, coming into Peking on mail days.\r\nWe are forced to take our whole establishment with us, so it is not\r\nworth while going for a shorter time.\r\n\r\nBy the bye my establishment has been increased by a teacher; not as\r\nin Europe, a master who is paid so much to come for an hour a day,\r\nbut a man who regularly enters my service, and is at my beck and\r\ncall whenever I want him. I have taken a header into Chinese, and am\r\nfloundering about in a sea of difficulties. One great disadvantage that\r\none labours under is that the native teachers, and there are no others,\r\nof course don’t speak a word of any language but their own. At first,\r\ntherefore, Ku, that’s my man’s name, and I used to sit and look at one\r\nanother in a hopeless state of unintelligibility, until either he got\r\nbored, made signs of having a stomach-ache, and took his leave, or I\r\ncould stand him no longer and dismissed him. However, it is surprising\r\nhow quick a man may pick up, not the language of a strange country, but\r\na jargon that will pass current, if he is dependent upon it for the\r\neveryday necessaries of life. Teachers, servants, cooks, and grooms,\r\nall must receive their orders in Chinese; shopping and bargain-driving\r\nincrease one’s stock of words; so one way or another Ku and I get on\r\npretty tolerably. He will accompany me to the hills, and as I mean\r\nto get through much work there, I hope that by the time you get this\r\nletter I shall be well started up the stream.\r\n\r\nA pleasanter addition to my personnel, and a sweeter, for he does not\r\neat garlic nor smoke opium, is a small Manilla poodle, Nou-nou by name,\r\nwhom I have inherited. He has consoled the exile of a succession of\r\ndiplomatists at Peking, and has finally fallen into my hands. He is\r\nthe jolliest little dog, and has the most companionable ways. Although\r\nonly a shade bigger than your Tiny, he is as plucky as Tom Sayers, and\r\nis the terror of strange dogs and Chinamen; indeed his valour being\r\nmuch too great for his body often brings him to trouble. For many years\r\nhe would fly at any dog that he saw in any part of the Legation, and\r\nbid him get out of his majesty’s way; but now he is no longer in his\r\n_première jeunesse_, having received much hard usage from dogs over\r\nwhom as puppies he had been used to exercise a terror, especially from\r\none big black retriever, who won’t stand any nonsense. Nou-nou has\r\ntaken possession of our courtyard, where by tacit consent the other\r\ndogs seem to respect his authority. If one of them so much as shows his\r\nnose there, Nou-nou pricks his ears, his tail curls as crisply as of\r\nold, and he flies at the intruder, who quickly disappears. Here Nou-nou\r\nleads a happy life; every one has a kind word for him, and his only\r\ngrievance is, that on Mondays and Thursdays he is carried off by a big\r\nChinaman, from his holy looks like a pre-Raphaelite picture, known as\r\n“the apostle,” and summarily washed.\r\n\r\nWe have better news from Shantung. The Imperialist troops have driven\r\nback the rebels. There is now no danger of this province being invaded,\r\nwhich might have been a serious thing for us, and certainly would have\r\nresulted in the sacking of Tientsing. It is really provoking, after all\r\nthe pains that have been taken to induce this wretched Government to\r\nsave itself, which it could easily do by the most ordinary exertion,\r\nto see half a dozen archers outside the gates making such practice\r\nat a target twenty yards off as any girl of eighteen, member of a\r\ntoxophilite club at home, would be ashamed of. Yet this is the stuff\r\nwhich the Chinese Government are content to accept as the means of\r\nputting down the insurrection. The troops that they are drilling in\r\nthe European fashion are merely a sop to foreign representatives,\r\nand not the evidence of earnest wishes to improve. Self-help and\r\nself-improvement seem repugnant to the nature of this belly-patting\r\nBuddhist nation. They are willing enough to get foreign officers,\r\nespecially Englishmen, in whom the example of Colonel Gordon has\r\ngiven them unbounded confidence, to drill and lead their troops; but\r\nthey will do nothing for themselves; and there is a class of superior\r\nofficers (such as Li, the governor of the province in which Shanghai\r\nis situated) who, having acquired a certain reputation for valour and\r\nmilitary ability among their own people, consider it beneath their\r\ndignity to serve under foreign officers. The obstacles which such men\r\nthrow in the way of the latter, together with the uncertainty of being\r\nable to obtain supplies and pay for the troops under their command,\r\nrender their position intolerable, as Colonel Gordon found on more\r\nthan one occasion. The English officers who have been lent to instruct\r\nthe Imperialists have found their way in many instances anything but\r\nsmooth, and have had great difficulty in carrying out the measures\r\nwhich they deemed necessary. Under these circumstances, it is not to\r\nbe wondered at that the rebels, whose ranks are swelled by the local\r\nbanditti, secret societies, and Imperialist soldiers mutinous for want\r\nof pay, should still show a head.\r\n\r\nWith this internal difficulty pressing them sorely, the Chinese\r\ncontinue persistently to break their treaty engagements with the Great\r\nPowers, any of which, if it were so minded, has a handle for blowing up\r\nthe whole concern. Wên-Hsiang, who is the chief of the Board of Foreign\r\nAffairs [which he virtually directs, although the Prince of Kung is\r\nnominally at its head], and who is the most advanced and patriotic man\r\nin the Government, is fully conscious of the danger of the situation;\r\nbut unfortunately he is a timid man, and it is one thing to convince\r\na Chinaman, and another to induce him to act upon his conviction. So\r\nthe treaties continue to be broken, and the existence of the present\r\ndynasty in China hangs upon the patience of foreign governments, who\r\nhave too great a stake in the country to sink the ship so long as there\r\nis a hope of her floating.\r\n\r\nIt is only fair to say, on the other hand, that the residence of\r\nforeign representatives at Peking during the last four years has\r\ncertainly been productive of some good. As an evidence of this, Dr.\r\nMartin, an American missionary, has produced, at the expense of the\r\nBoard of Foreign Affairs and with the co-operation of a commission\r\nspecially appointed by the Prince of Kung, a translation into the\r\nChinese language of Wheaton’s _International Law_. To this Tung-ta-jên,\r\nwhom I mentioned in my last letter to you as the translator of\r\nLongfellow’s “Psalm of Life,” has added a preface. This preface, coming\r\nas it does from the vice-president of the College of Historians, one of\r\nthe chiefs of the lettered class in China, adds great authority to the\r\nwork, the publication of which is certainly an event of importance in\r\nthe history of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               LETTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\n                                        PI YÜN SSŬ, _7th July 1865_.\r\n\r\nYou will see by the date of this that we have beaten a retreat from\r\nthe dust, heat, and filth of the city, and that our “villegiatura” has\r\nbegun. Indeed, Peking was becoming insupportable. The thermometer when\r\nwe left was standing at 108° in the shade, the highest degree which it\r\nhas reached for these three years, and I was heartily glad to turn my\r\nback upon the Legation gates.\r\n\r\nThe plain between these hills and the town is very beautiful. It is\r\nthickly studded with farmsteads, knolls of trees, and tombs, which are\r\nalways the prettiest spots in China, for as a balance against the dirt\r\nand squalor in which they pass their lives, the Chinese choose the most\r\nromantic and delightful places for their final habitations. The soil is\r\nwonderfully fertile, and yields two crops in the year, so that usually\r\nthe plain bears every appearance of prosperity; but this year, owing\r\nto the excessive heat and drought, the first crop has failed, and the\r\nfields are parched and burnt up. In vain the Emperor prays for rain;\r\nit only comes in rare and scanty showers, and the fierce sun bakes\r\nthe ground harder than ever. The country folk are in great distress,\r\nand food is at famine prices. Yet they seem happy and contented, and\r\nwhen we asked one of the priests here whether there was no danger of a\r\nfamine riot, he answered, “Oh, no! the people about here are too great\r\nfools to get up a disturbance.” Those that are hardest up will sell\r\ntheir daughters into bondage, and there will be an end of the matter.\r\n\r\nThe hills west of Peking are the Switzerland of Northern China. They\r\nare not very high nor extraordinarily beautiful, but there are some\r\nvery pretty gorges and valleys, richly wooded, and at any rate the air\r\nis fresh and pure. Every gorge has a perfect nest of temples, built\r\nby the pious emperors of the Ming dynasty and the earlier Tartars,\r\nfor which good deeds the _Corps diplomatique_ at Peking cannot be\r\ntoo grateful. Properly speaking, according to the rules of their\r\norder, the Buddhist monks are forbidden to receive any money for the\r\nhospitality which they offer to strangers, so when the Chinese go to\r\nstay at a temple they restore or beautify some part of it as a return;\r\nbut we prefer paying a few dollars, and in spite of their statutes the\r\narrangement seems to suit the monks as well as it does us.\r\n\r\nOur temple is called “Pi Yün Ssŭ,” “the temple of the azure clouds,”\r\na romantic name, and certainly the place is worthy of it. It is\r\nbuilt on terraces ascending the hill to a length of about half a\r\nmile, and on every terrace is a shrine, each more beautiful (if\r\nthat is the proper word to apply to the grotesque buildings of this\r\ncountry) than the last; black and white marble statues and vases,\r\nbronze dragons, alto-relievos and basso-relievos representing kings\r\nand warriors, gods and goddesses, and fabulous monsters, all of rare\r\nworkmanship,—inscriptions graven on marble and stone, and bronze or\r\ngilt upon wood, meet one at every step; and the whole is set in a nest\r\nof rock-work, fountains, woods, and gardens. At the top is a small\r\ntemple more in the Indian than the Chinese style, and here there is\r\na very curious idol with ten heads, three large ones at the bottom,\r\nfrom which three smaller ones spring, in their turn carrying three\r\nlesser ones surmounted by a single very small head. The hands are in\r\nproportion. This little place commands a panoramic view over the plain,\r\nwith the walls and towers of Peking in the distance.\r\n\r\nOur habitation consists of several little houses on one side of\r\nthe temple; we dine in an open pavilion, surrounded by a pond and\r\nartificial rockery, with ferns and mosses in profusion; high trees\r\nshade it from the sun, and close by us a cold fountain pours out of the\r\nrock into the pond, in which we can ice our wine to perfection. The\r\npond was dried up, and the fountain had been turned from its channel,\r\nwhen we arrived; but we got together a few coolies, and soon set that\r\nright. Fancy our feelings on coming here, when we were told that if\r\nthere came no rain we could have no bath! This too in a climate where\r\nthe hot nights make a morning wash doubly necessary. The priest had\r\nhardly said the word, when a tremendous thunderstorm broke over the\r\nmountain and set our minds at rest, and next morning we discovered that\r\nwe could have the most delicious natural bath. Our life here is very\r\nsimple and very, very dull. We are only two—Saurin and myself. We rise\r\nat any hour after daybreak, breakfast at eight, dine at three; after\r\ndinner we go for a ride, or a scramble over the mountain, and come home\r\nto tea at about eight or nine. We sit smoking our cheroots for perhaps\r\nan hour, talking always about home and watching the fire-flies, that,\r\naccording to Chinese tradition, served as lamps to Confucius and his\r\ndisciples. A visit from or to the Russian Legation, who have got a\r\ntemple at about an hour and a half’s ride from here, is the only break\r\nto the monotony of our daily life. I have my teacher with me here, and\r\nwork with him at the language from breakfast to dinner; that is my\r\nserious occupation, and about as hard a task as one could wish for. I\r\ncarry about my lessons for the rest of the day written on paper fans—a\r\ncapital dodge for keeping one’s work before one. We are rather bothered\r\nby mosquitoes, and a most venomous little insect called the sand-fly,\r\nyellow in colour, and smaller than a midge, which is lucky, for if he\r\nwere of the size of a blue-bottle I should think his bite would be\r\nfatal. There are quantities of scorpions too; one of our men was stung\r\nthe other day. We heard a great wailing and crying one night, for all\r\nthe world like an Irish wake; next morning our servants told us that\r\nthe cook’s assistant had been stung in the hand, and that he had died\r\nin an hour, but that he had come to rights again, and was getting well.\r\nThis sounded something like being “kilt entirely.” The man’s presence\r\nat the temple illustrates a custom of the country; of course, as is the\r\nway of the East, no one can move without a large retinue. There must be\r\na valet for each man, and a groom for each horse, and a man or two to\r\ndo nothing, and two or three more to look on and see them do it. But\r\nbesides this, like Thackeray’s description of Irishmen and their poor\r\nrelations, no Chinaman is so poor or mean but what he can find a poorer\r\nand a meaner to do part of his work. A coolie earning three dollars a\r\nmonth will pay another one dollar a month to help him, and he in his\r\nturn will give a boy a few cash, that he may enjoy his ease and his\r\nopium. The man who was stung was the cook’s poor relation. Although his\r\nbrother and the other men supposed him to be dying, and finally to\r\nhave actually died, they never came and told us, nor did they get any\r\nassistance for him. We heard the noise, but one of our servants has a\r\nvery pretty little talent for tickling a lute, and there was so little\r\ndifference between the sounds of the wake and those of the concerts he\r\ngets up, that we thought the hullabaloo was only a melancholy variety\r\nof the latter, so we took no notice of it. As far as Chinese remedies\r\nare concerned, better be without them. It is almost impossible to\r\nbelieve the amount of ignorance which exists in China about medicine\r\nand surgery. Native doctors, who never dissect, are utterly ignorant\r\nfor the most part of the position of the heart, the lungs, and the\r\nother principal organs. They are ignorant of the difference between\r\narteries and veins, nor do they understand the circulation, looking\r\nupon the several pulses of the body as the effects of separate causes.\r\nAll diseases are attributed by them to their favourite doctrine, “hot\r\nand cold influences.” They have a certain knowledge of the use of\r\ndrugs, and of mercury in particular, but their remedy above all others\r\nis acupuncture. Some days ago my groom had an attack of diarrhœa, and\r\nhis medical man pricked him underneath the tongue for it! Sir John\r\nDavis tells a story of a doctor who wanted to prick a man for hernia.\r\nIf in these prickings they cut into an artery, and the man dies, why,\r\nso much the worse for him! it is fate. Astrology plays a great part in\r\ntheir medical art, certain planets being supposed to influence certain\r\nparts of the body. It is one among many instances in which one sees\r\nthe analogy between the present condition of China and Europe in the\r\nMiddle Ages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              LETTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\n                                            PEKING, _8th July 1865_.\r\n\r\nWe have ridden in to spend three days, copying despatches and sighing\r\nfor our “cool grot.” The town seemed too beastly as we came in. Peking,\r\nas Southey said of Exeter, “is ancient and stinks.” The “Beggar’s\r\nBridge,” which we have to pass every time we go into the Chinese city,\r\nand nearly every time we go out, is the most loathsome and stinking\r\nexhibition that it ever was my fate to come across. Here every day a\r\nhundred or two of the most degraded specimens of humanity congregate\r\nand beg. By far the greater majority of them are clothed only in dirt,\r\nand all sorts of repulsive cutaneous complaints; some have a linen rag,\r\nbut it is worn over the shoulders, and in no way serves as a decent\r\ncovering. Lice, mange, scrofula, leprosy, and filth are allowed to\r\nremain undisturbed by water or drugs. They are a stock-in-trade, and\r\nas such rather encouraged than not. It is a sickening sight when these\r\ncreatures come and perform the ko̔to̔u to us, prostrating themselves in\r\nthe dust or mud, which is scarcely as dirty as themselves. I spare you\r\na description of the food I have seen them eating. If ever I get back\r\nto Europe, I feel that the Beggar’s Bridge will be a nightmare to me\r\nfor the rest of my life. All this strikes one with double force after\r\nspending a fortnight in the country among the healthy, sunburnt natives\r\nof the hills. I assure you that they look quite handsome after the\r\nyellow townsfolk. It would amuse our friends at home, if they could see\r\nus the centre of a group of thirty or forty of these brown villagers,\r\nin some out-of-the-way valley where Englishmen are about as often seen\r\nas Chinamen in Yorkshire. They ask us all the most absurd questions\r\nabout ourselves, our clothes, and our dogs, who are quite as great\r\nobjects of wonder as ourselves. They never will believe that Nou-nou is\r\nnot some variety of sheep, and Saurin’s pointer, a very handsome young\r\ndog of French royal breed, comes in for much admiration. The women\r\nare all frightened at us, and keep well out of the way; we see them\r\ntimidly peering out of their doors at the foreign barbarians who kill\r\nlittle children, and use their eyes for photography, but it is seldom\r\nthat anything but a stout old matron of great courage will venture to\r\ncome near us. The people are beginning to get rid of their prejudices\r\nagainst us, and to see that we mean them no injury; at any rate they\r\nare quite friendly, and seem to look upon us as harmless eccentric\r\ncreatures, but very ugly. As for personal safety, no one ever dreams of\r\ncarrying arms, either by day or by night, and nobody is ever insulted\r\nor attacked.\r\n\r\nWe hear bad news of mercantile prospects in the south. Notwithstanding\r\ntheir having been hit so hard last season, the merchants have been\r\nspeculating again more rashly than ever, and vying with each other\r\nin buying up tea. The Chinese are quite up to this, and have leagued\r\ntogether to raise prices. The nearer our merchants have got to the\r\ntea-growing districts by means of the opening of new ports, the\r\ndearer tea has become. Tea was never so cheap as when Canton was the\r\nonly outlet to the market. This seems a paradox, but it is easily\r\nexplained. The merchants competing to buy on the spot have caused\r\nthe Chinese growers to send up their prices to any height, and the\r\nforeigner cannot transport the tea south so cheaply as the native,\r\nso that both the original price paid to the farmers, and the cost of\r\ntransport, have been raised, and the merchants are paying the penalty\r\nof their own hunger for new markets.\r\n\r\nAs a set-off against this bad news, we have good tidings with regard\r\nto the rebels, who were in Shantung; they appear to be dispersed, some\r\nsouth and some west, and the capital is safe. For once the Chinese can\r\nlay the praise to themselves, they having acted without foreign aid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               LETTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       PI YÜN SSŬ, _21st July 1865_.\r\n\r\nI daresay you will be curious to hear something more of our temple life\r\nthan I have been able to tell you hitherto. We have been exploring the\r\nneighbourhood in all directions, and certainly there is plenty to be\r\nseen, although all the points of interest are temples, either Buddhist\r\nor Taoist, and the description of one might hold good for all. The most\r\ncurious of these is at a distance from us of about a mile and a half;\r\nit is called Wo-Fo-Ssŭ, “the temple of the Sleeping Buddha,” from a\r\nhuge sleeping idol which it contains, about 20 feet in length. At first\r\nI thought the figure was meant for a female, a sort of Sleeping Beauty\r\nin the Wood, but the attendant priest assured me that it was meant for\r\nBuddha himself. The idol lies sleeping in a huge shrine, surrounded\r\nby a number of lesser saints. His slippers, made of softest velvet\r\nand satin, are lying at his feet ready for him to put on whenever it\r\nshall suit his Holiness to get up; each of his attendants is likewise\r\nprovided with slippers. He has been sleeping now for more than 700\r\nyears, so he brings no great profit to the shoemaking trade. The shrine\r\nis held in great reverence, and is decorated with an inscription\r\nby the Emperor Chien-Lung himself, who seems never to have lost an\r\nopportunity of writing and building; of both these favourite pastimes\r\nof his, Wo-Fo-Ssŭ bears examples, for leading out of one of the courts\r\nof the temple is a most beautiful little Imperial abode, now falling\r\ninto decay, like everything else here, but which once must have been\r\nperfectly lovely. Of all the pavilions, courts, rockeries, and shrines,\r\nthe Lotus Pond alone remains in all its glory. Equally in ruins is an\r\nImperial hunting lodge, close by our temple, standing in the middle of\r\na deer-park which reaches up to the top of the mountain, fenced in by\r\na high wall. This, too, was a favourite resort of Chien-Lung, and he\r\nmust have spent a king’s ransom in decorating it; a gate or two, here\r\nand there a summer-house, and one pagoda of yellow and green tiles,\r\nshow what it must once have been. But the whole place has crumbled to\r\npieces, and the deer and game stray at pleasure through what were once\r\nthe gorgeous apartments of the Emperor. The yellow tiles here, worked\r\nin the highest relief with dragons, griffins, lions, and other emblems,\r\nare marvellous specimens of potter’s work. Whole pediments are made in\r\nsmall pieces and so cunningly joined together that they look like one\r\nblock. A very small annual expense would have kept the place in perfect\r\nrepair; but to keep in repair is not an Asiatic attribute. Alongside\r\none of the paths of the park, which is full of the most delightful\r\nresting-places, I noticed the remains of what looked like a number of\r\nstalls at a fancy-fair, and on inquiring I found that they were little\r\nshops at which it was the privilege of the eunuchs of the palace to\r\nsell trinkets and other trifles to the Emperor as he passed with his\r\nwives.\r\n\r\nAmong other things that Chien-Lung did for these temples, he imported\r\nfrom the palace of Jo Hol in Manchuria a quantity of a kind of tree\r\ncigala, by Europeans called wee-wees from the noise they make, by the\r\nChinese called Tatsŭ-chi-liao. They are the most curious insects, and\r\nmake a clatter which is as if it were produced by the metal tongues\r\nof an accordion. They go on all day and drive one nearly distracted.\r\nSometimes one can hardly hear oneself speak, but the Chinese delight in\r\nthem, and my teacher told me the story of their introduction as if he\r\nhad been speaking of an importation of nightingales. Happily at Peking\r\nthey declined to flourish; there we have only a lesser and more piano\r\nsort, which it is an Imperial amusement at certain times of the year to\r\ncatch off the trees with long bamboo rods tipped with bird-lime. The\r\nChinese certainly find pleasure in what are to us very disagreeable\r\nnoises. Fancy a flight of pigeons with Eolian harps tied to their\r\ntails! The first time I heard it above my head I thought something\r\ndreadful must be going to happen. However, that fancy has a practical\r\nside to it, for it keeps off the hawks which abound at Peking.\r\n\r\nWe have been revelling for two days in the very rare luxury of wet\r\nweather. What a pleasure a real rainy day is in this burnt-up climate!\r\na day when the hills look as if they might be Scotch moors, and the\r\ntemples and pavilions as if they ought to melt away and be replaced\r\nby the clubs in Pall Mall. On these wet days we wander about our own\r\nplace, of the size of which you may judge from the fact that one\r\nbuilding alone contains Buddha and his five hundred Lo-hans, or saints\r\nof the third class, larger than life, just like the temple of which\r\nI told you at Canton, where, however, they are smaller; then whole\r\ncourtyards are surrounded by buildings, in which heaven and hell are\r\nrepresented by hundreds upon hundreds of wooden dolls. The Buddhist\r\nheaven is a very queer place according to this view of it, where the\r\nheight of happiness seems to consist in riding a tiger or griffin, or\r\nsome equally uncomfortable mount; but hell is really too grotesque,\r\nespecially the ladies’ department, where the unfortunate women who have\r\nsinned in this world are to be seen experiencing what is, to say the\r\nvery least of it, very inconsiderate treatment at the hands of a number\r\nof lavender-kid-glove-coloured fiends. In the gentlemen’s department a\r\nfavourite punishment is for sinners to have their heads cut off, and\r\nbe compelled to walk about with them under their arms like a crush\r\nhat at a ball. No description of mine could give you any idea of the\r\nabsurdity and ugliness of the idols and dolls. I can’t say that, so\r\nfar as I can judge, any real respect is paid to them. The people seem\r\nto make sort of picnic parties here, quite as a matter of sightseeing,\r\nrather than of religion, just as some tourists visit cathedrals for\r\ntheir beauty and for the art treasures which they contain, and not as\r\nan act of worship. However, they call visiting a temple “Kwang Miao,”\r\nwhich means to do an act of respect and worship, so perhaps some may\r\nattach a religious importance to it. The priests at our temple are a\r\nlazy, brutish lot, and rather inclined to be insolent. At Wo-Fo-Ssŭ\r\nthey are far more respectable, and a man who was staying there told\r\nme that they had constantly choral service in the temple, especially\r\nat night; here I very rarely hear the bell and drum beat for prayers.\r\nI must do our priests the justice to say that one day I offered one\r\nof them a glass of wine, which their laws forbid, but their stomachs\r\ncrave for, and he refused, although there was no one by to have told\r\nthe tale, so I suppose they have a conscience somewhere and that they\r\nregard its pricks.\r\n\r\nI am sorry to say that by being out here we missed seeing the state\r\nfuneral of the famous general San-Ko-Lin-Sin. He was carried all the\r\nway to Peking from Shantung, where he was killed, every mandarin on\r\nthe road being bound to furnish men to bear his body. The Emperor\r\npays the expense of his funeral and of his lying in state at Peking,\r\nand went himself to pour a libation before the coffin. San-Ko-Lin-Sin\r\nwas a feudal Mongol prince, and his son has now been created a Wang,\r\nor prince. There are many people who say that the general was not\r\nkilled by the rebels, but by his own troops. The account of his death,\r\nhowever, was given with great details, and he was probably killed\r\nfighting. “A corner of the Great Wall has gone,” say the Chinese, in\r\ntheir picturesque way, when a great general is killed in battle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                LETTER X\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                PEKING, _24th July_.\r\n\r\nNo mail in—we are expecting it any minute, but have begun to fear that\r\nwe must send off our bag before its arrival. I never saw anything so\r\ncurious as the change which the last few wet days have caused in all\r\nthe face of the country—its whole appearance is altered. What were\r\nbefore arid and desert patches of sand are now turned into green and\r\nluxuriant corn-fields—roads that were like dried water-courses, with\r\nsix inches of dust lying on them and banks of sand on each side, are\r\nfresh English-looking lanes. The crops have sprung up to be so tall,\r\nthat we could not see our usual landmarks, and lost our way; for the\r\nplain between Peking and the hills is so scarred and intersected by\r\nroads and paths, that one has to make straight for some point in the\r\ndistance, or one is thrown out—all the houses and groups of cottages\r\nare exactly like one another and afford no assistance in steering; it\r\nis a regular Chinese puzzle. The thermometer has fallen from 108° in\r\nthe shade to 75°. Such a relief!—I hope that we have now got quit of\r\nthe very great heat.\r\n\r\nBy the bye, in my last letter I spoke about Chinese doctors and\r\nprescriptions, and their doctrine of the hot and cold influences. My\r\nteacher has been telling me about their principles of diagnosis. It\r\nappears that they attach great importance to examining the tongue.\r\nNow if the tongue is white the patient is under the cold influence.\r\nIf it is yellow, he is under the hot influence. If the centre of the\r\ntongue is white, and the edges yellow, he is under the cold influence\r\ninside, and his skin is under the hot—and so _vice versa_. Palmistry\r\nand the study of the face and features are also brought to bear upon\r\nmedicine—certain conditions of feature portend certain events in the\r\nfuture. My teacher told me that he feared he should not be long-lived,\r\nbecause the lobe of his ear was small—a large lobe to the ear is much\r\nadmired on all accounts, but specially as a sign of wisdom, and Buddha\r\nand the other idols are represented with huge appendages. A soft hand\r\nis the sign of longevity; the eyes, nose and nostrils, and chin, all\r\nhave certain prophetic meanings to those who are wise to read them. I\r\ntold my teacher about phrenology—he was delighted with the idea, and\r\nstood open-mouthed while his bumps were being felt. His character,\r\nhowever, did not interest him much, but he was very anxious to know how\r\nlong he would live, and whether he would hold an office of any kind.\r\n\r\nWe have no news.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               LETTER XI\r\n\r\n\r\n                                          PEKING, _7th August 1865_.\r\n\r\nThe extreme heat has left us at last, and the autumn has set in—a most\r\ncharming season in this climate. It is a regular second spring—not\r\nsuch a spring as we are used to in England, which is a struggle for\r\nmastery between hot sun and chilling east winds, but a season in which\r\nthe burnt-up vegetation literally _springs_ into life again under the\r\ninfluence of quickening rain and warmth—the trees put forth shoots\r\nand tender green leaves, and the plain is one rich field of millet\r\ntwelve feet high, through which one rides feeling like Gulliver in\r\nthe farms of Brobdingnag. The rains have driven us out of our temple\r\nat the hills, which I much regret, but it had become untenable lately\r\nowing to damp; the scorpions, too, began to come into the house in\r\ntoo great numbers to be pleasant; five were killed in my room in two\r\ndays, besides other creeping things. There were quantities of lizards\r\nalso in my house. The Chinese have an idea that lizards, which they\r\ncall scorpion-tigers, kill the scorpions by making them commit suicide\r\nin this wise: the lizard touches the scorpion on the back with his\r\ntail, the creature strikes at him, but the enemy is too quick, and he\r\nstings himself instead; this is repeated until the lizard sees that the\r\nscorpion’s poison is exhausted, when he goes at him at once and eats\r\nhim. We rather exploded this theory, for we caught two scorpions and\r\ntwo lizards, and put them in a box with a glass cover, and the only\r\nresult was that the large scorpion ate the smaller, continuing his\r\ncannibal feast during ten hours, and leaving nothing of him but the tip\r\nof his tail; so we let the lizards go and killed the scorpion, whom\r\nShao-To, our head man, considered to have become doubly venomous as he\r\nmust have the poison of two in him.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the hills we took a great walk over all the summits in\r\norder to get a thorough idea of the country around. It looks as if the\r\nsea, now about 100 miles off, must once have washed the foot of the\r\nmountains, forming bays, promontories, and headlands into the plain,\r\nwhich has the same appearance of being alluvial as that of Troy. The\r\nnumberless watercourses which intersect it show that formerly there\r\nmust have been a far greater flow of water towards the sea than is ever\r\nseen now, even in the rainiest season. From the highest peak we had a\r\nmagnificent view of Peking, Yuen-Ming-Yuen, and the villages around,\r\nand behind us was another range of mountains, more wild, more rugged\r\nand picturesque than that on which we stood. It was raining slightly,\r\nand as we watched there came on one of the strangest atmospheric\r\neffects I ever saw. Between us and Peking there was a faint mist,\r\nwhile over the city itself a heavy cloud was hanging, partly black and\r\npartly lurid, with a sort of hellish glare about it that was perfectly\r\nindescribable. All around us there was a deep blue gloom; it was such a\r\nscene as Lot’s wife may have looked upon.\r\n\r\nWe rode into town the day before yesterday, and made a circuit so\r\nas to take Yuen-Ming-Yuen, the famous summer palace, on our way. It\r\nwas a new road to me, and a very pleasant one. We passed several\r\nChinese villages, principally composed of soldiers’ barracks,\r\nlike elongated cow-sheds, and one very pretty prosperous-looking\r\nlittle city. As we drew near the Imperial grounds the scenery became\r\nprettier and prettier; above all there were shady groves, which were\r\ndoubly delightful for the scorching morning sun that was blazing\r\nupon us. Quaint stone and marble bridges were thrown over the dykes\r\nand water-channels, and little gables of pagodas, charged with the\r\ninevitable tile gurgoyles, peeped out of the woods at intervals.\r\n\r\nYuen-Ming-Yuen (“the round bright garden”) is one of three parks\r\ncontaining Imperial palaces, two of which were destroyed in 1860.\r\nSome of the more out-of-the-way buildings in the third escaped notice\r\nand destruction. The name Yuen-Ming-Yuen has been wrongly given by\r\nEuropeans to the whole, and still more wrongly to the only one of the\r\nthree parks (the third park is called Yu-Chuan-Shan, or the “Hill of\r\nthe Fountain of Jewels”) that can be seen, and which we visited. The\r\nproper name of this is Wan-Shao-Shan, the “Hill of the Ten Thousand\r\nLongevities,” which is a figure of speech for the fête day of the\r\nEmperor or Empress. Of course it is against the orders of the Chinese\r\nauthorities that this is shown, but the guardians of the place make a\r\ngood profit out of it, and if they were caught they would always be\r\nready with the excuse that “the barbarians forced their way in and\r\nwould not be kept out.”\r\n\r\nWe were ushered through a number of courtyards, where there was nothing\r\nto be seen but ruined and charred walls, and the ghosts of departed\r\npine-trees, and along a pretty covered walk to a pavilion by the lake\r\nwhere we were to breakfast. It was a lovely spot. The lake is a mass\r\nof lotus plants now in full flower; there are quantities of little\r\nislands covered with trees and buildings. A number of boats with naked\r\nfishermen in them gave a touch of wildness and barbarity to the scene,\r\nand further added to our amusement; for one of the men, in the hopes of\r\nfinding Heaven knows what small loot among the masses of rubbish where\r\nthere is not so much as a tile left whole, had come on shore and was\r\nlying hidden among the ruins; whom when the guardians perceived, they\r\nset up such a game of hare and hounds, and such a throwing of stones\r\nand bad language, as reminded me of Eton days when a boy from another\r\nhouse was found in my dame’s without being able to give a good account\r\nof himself. When the brave men returned all panting and out of breath,\r\nthey were very proud of themselves, and told us the story with much\r\nvigour and dramatic action, for it was a very valiant deed, as they\r\nwere only three to one, “with power to add to their number.”\r\n\r\nThere is nothing like a Chinese servant for a picnic or expedition\r\nof any kind, under whatever difficulties he may be placed. Shao-To\r\nnever lets us lack for anything. Even Dan, the pointer puppy, had his\r\nusual mess of rice and broth, as if he had been at home. When we had\r\nbreakfasted, with an admiring crowd around us, we went to explore the\r\nruins. It is difficult to form any idea of what the palace must have\r\nbeen like, so complete has the work of destruction been. We scrambled\r\nup and down steep steps (that must have been hard work for the poor\r\nlittle cramped feet that trod them) and along terraces where the wild\r\nvines and creepers, and sweet-scented weeds, now grow in tangled\r\nmasses; there is not a stone that has not been split by the action\r\nof the fire. Two colossal marble kylins, of rare workmanship, are\r\nseared with cracks, and have almost fallen away in flakes. Of the great\r\noctagonal three-storied palace, not one stone lies on another, and a\r\nwhite marble balustrade alone shows where it stood. Higher up there are\r\nstill a few remains untouched by fire. There is a little bronze temple,\r\na perfect gem, which of course escaped, and two little revolving wooden\r\npagodas full of small gods and images standing in a tower were also\r\npreserved; whilst above all a larger temple, built entirely of the\r\nyellow and green tiles I have so often described to you, shows what a\r\nblaze of glory the place must once have been. But that glory has passed\r\naway now, and so rapidly does ruin work in this climate, that soon even\r\nthe little that remains to-day will perish. There is one very curious\r\ndevice thoroughly Chinese that I must mention. At the end of the\r\nterrace by the lake a sort of jetty stands out, built of huge blocks of\r\nstone, in the shape of a junk being launched into the lake, forty-one\r\npaces long by nine broad. Some of the rockwork is very quaint. When\r\nthe Chinese come upon a quaintly-shaped rock or stone they mount it\r\non a pedestal and make an ornament of it. There are many very curious\r\nspecimens at Wan-Shao-Shan.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the destruction of the summer palace, I believe that,\r\npolitically speaking, it was a mistake. It was necessary that some\r\ngreat reprisal should be made for the outrages committed by the\r\nChinese; but the destruction should have taken place inside the\r\ncity, and not twelve miles off; for so ignorant are the large body\r\nof the Chinese of what passes outside their four walls, that there\r\nare many here in Peking who to this day believe that we had to pay an\r\nindemnity for leave to withdraw our troops, and that we are only here\r\non sufferance. If this is the case in Peking, in the provinces people\r\nmust be still further from the truth, and it is the policy of the\r\nGovernment to keep up the delusion. Had the Imperial palace in Peking\r\nbeen destroyed the matter would have been notorious to all, and its\r\nrecollection would not have been blown away with the last cloud of\r\nsmoke from Yuen-Ming-Yuen.\r\n\r\nHere is some more Chinese doctoring which may amuse you. A boy was\r\nbrought the other day to the hospital of the London Mission with\r\nslight feverish symptoms. The doctor not being at home, the boy was\r\ntaken by his parents to a Chinese practitioner, who prescribed a\r\ndecoction of three scorpions, to be taken internally! The boy was well\r\nnext day in spite of it.\r\n\r\nA recipe for ophthalmia, posted on the walls of Peking, runs as\r\nfollows:—Take three bright brass coins of the reign of Tao Kwang, boil\r\nthem in water, and use the lotion. Here is our old saw, “A hair of\r\nthe dog that bit you,” worked in practice: For a dog bite, catch the\r\ndog, pull out a few of his hairs, and work them into a paste with a\r\nlittle lime and oil—apply the paste to the wound; of course, the lime\r\nacting as a caustic is the real remedy, but the hair is the one that is\r\nbelieved in.\r\n\r\nThe Legation is at present giving hospitality to a certain gentleman\r\nwho is accredited by a small state to make a treaty with the Chinese,\r\nas he pompously announces “dans l’intérêt de la Chine même”; if he\r\ndoes not talk less big at the Tsung-Li Yamên, or Foreign Office, he\r\nwill find the Chinese far less tractable than he seems to think it\r\ntheir duty to be; for they are much too sharp to suppose that anybody\r\ncomes out here to negotiate treaties in their interest without having\r\na still keener eye upon his own; and as for themselves, of course\r\nthe mandarins, at any rate, would rather return to the old state of\r\nthings, have nothing to do with us and our treaties, and sacrifice\r\nthe revenue that accrues to them from their customs. The pressure\r\nput upon them from abroad, and the counsels of Mr. Hart, the Chinese\r\nInspector-General of Customs, and a very able man, alone keep them\r\nstraight, and compel the central Government to assume responsibilities\r\nwhich they would rather leave to the provincial authorities. Fancy\r\nthe difficulty of stirring up into action men whose highest idea of\r\ncelestial happiness is an eternity passed in the contemplation of their\r\nown paunches, in the society of Buddha and his Lo-hans.\r\n\r\nIt is very hard upon our interpreters that they should have to do\r\nthe work of other missions besides our own. These ministers of other\r\nstates come up here without any staff whatever, and the whole of their\r\nbusiness falls upon the Legation to whose good offices they may be\r\nintrusted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               LETTER XII\r\n\r\n\r\n                                         PEKING, _22nd August 1865_.\r\n\r\nSince I last wrote to you we have been leading the most monotonous of\r\nlives, and no news from home has come to cheer us. We have had staying\r\nwith us one of the few stray visitors that chance drives up here—a Mr.\r\nR——, an officer in the commissariat, and a very pleasant companion he\r\nwas; he came fresh from Japan, and full of stories about Yokohama and\r\nYedo, but out here we should prefer to hear about London. There really\r\nis little temptation to travellers to come here now, for, thanks to\r\nthe misbehaviour of certain of our countrymen, the Chinese have shut\r\nup the principal lions of the town, and the temples of Heaven, and\r\nof Confucius, are not shown, even to members of the Legations. I for\r\none have not been able to visit them. The great Lama Temple is still\r\nto be seen, and to any one who has not seen a Chinese temple, is a\r\ngreat show; but they are all very like one another, the main difference\r\nbeing merely a question of size. It is very provoking to be kept out of\r\nreally interesting sights by the brutality of travelling bullies who\r\nwill force their way into places where they have no right to go.\r\n\r\nAll we can do now for our visitors is to show them the panorama of the\r\ntwo cities from the walls, the top of which forms a ride or walk right\r\nround Peking, and where the wonderful observatory of the old Jesuit\r\nfathers, with its beautiful bronze instruments, still stands, and to\r\ntake them through the streets and over the curio shops—braving offence\r\ngiven to eyes and nostrils. The curio shops especially make up an\r\namusing day, and I am always glad of an excuse to go there. There is a\r\nbazaar, too, just inside the Chinese city, a sort of Lowther Arcade on\r\na small scale, where toys, scents, sham jewellery, cheap embroidery,\r\nand other rubbish are sold, and which is quite worth seeing. This is\r\ngreatly patronised by the Mongols, who never weary of admiring the\r\nshowy trash exposed for sale. The Mongols are to the Pekingese what\r\nthe Auvergnats are to the _gamins de Paris_, or a bumpkin come up to\r\nLondon for the cattle-show to the cabbies and ’busmen. They are the\r\nperpetual butts of jokes, sells, and cheatery, and are done at every\r\nopportunity. The bazaar leads on to the Beggar’s Bridge, with its mass\r\nof rotting humanity, a place that it makes one shudder to think of, and\r\nonce past that we are well in the Chinese city. The amount of traffic\r\nis always very great, and it is no easy matter to thread one’s way\r\nthrough the crowd of mules, carts, horses, and footpads, and the worst\r\nof it is that one is continually hustled up against some unhappy leper,\r\nwhose only clothing is dirt and sores. The neatness and nicety of the\r\nshops are a great contrast to the filth and squalor of the streets\r\nthemselves. Inside everything is as clean as water can make it; outside\r\nis a dunghill, where the beggars are disputing with the dogs and pigs\r\nthe right to water-melon rinds, rotten vegetables, and dead carrion.\r\nThe street hawkers are a great feature; of course they all have their\r\npeculiar cries as in Europe; but in addition to this each trade has its\r\nown announcement in the shape of some instrument—one trade carries a\r\nthing like a huge Jew’s harp, another has a tiny gong, a third a drum,\r\na fourth beats two pieces of bamboo together, and so forth. All these\r\nmake a terrible clatter, and the noise is increased by the beggars, who\r\ntake up a position opposite some shop—a cook-house for choice—and there\r\nmake themselves odious to eyes, ears, and nostrils until its owner can\r\nstand it no longer and buys them off with a copper cash or piece of\r\nrefuse food. Among Chinese street characters the _improvisatore_ is\r\none of the foremost. He is as loud and fluent as his Italian compeer,\r\nand infinitely more energetic. He generally accompanies himself on the\r\nbones, but often has a little boy to beat a drum for him. He works\r\nhimself into a regular frenzy, and jumps about like one possessed of\r\na devil; he dances and gesticulates and raves until the sweat runs\r\ndown his face; but nothing tires him, and he never halts nor pauses in\r\nhis chant. These men are too nimble of speech and too slang for most\r\nforeigners to catch a word; but I suppose they are generally witty and\r\nentertaining, for they command immense audiences of gaping Chinamen,\r\nand their sallies are received with great delight. Like the Italians,\r\nwhen they have worked up their audience to a proper pitch of interest\r\nthey stop, and refuse to go on with the story without more coppers. At\r\nthe approach of the foreign barbarian some little witticism is launched\r\n_à notre adresse_. You may judge whether it is very complimentary;\r\nhowever, as “it amuses them and don’t hurt us,” that don’t much\r\nsignify. Perhaps the hawkers whose wares are the most curious to\r\nEuropeans are the men who carry about live crickets and cicadas for\r\nsale, either in tiny wooden cages or tied to bamboo rods. The Chinese\r\nbuy them to any amount as pets, and some make the crickets fight like\r\nquails and game-cocks.\r\n\r\nWe are very often accosted by the more respectable class. The first\r\nsalutation is always, “Have you had your dinner, sir?” which is the\r\nChinese, “How d’ye do?” and then the conversation runs as follows:—\r\n\r\n“Your honourable name?”\r\n\r\n“My name is Mi. What is your honourable name?”\r\n\r\n“My shabby name is Hwang. What are the years of your age?”\r\n\r\n“I am twenty-eight” (great astonishment, for I pass usually for\r\nforty-five).\r\n\r\n“How long have you been inside the walls?” (at Peking).\r\n\r\n“About four months.”\r\n\r\n“Do you belong to the great Ying, or the great Fa?” (English or French).\r\n\r\nThen follow a string of the most absurd questions about England. One\r\nman asked one day whether it was true that in Europe there were men\r\nwith holes through their chests and backs, whom their servants carried\r\nabout by passing a bamboo pole through the hole and so hoisting them on\r\nto their shoulders. Such is the Chinese education, that one of their\r\nscholars, deeply read in ethics and Confucian books, would be capable\r\nof asking questions to the full as ridiculous as the above, which,\r\nindeed, was put by an educated man.\r\n\r\nAfter the din, bustle, and dirt of the streets, it is very refreshing\r\nto go into one of the shops, where there is always the civillest\r\nwelcome, even though one may buy nothing. In almost all cases the\r\nmaster of the house gives us delicious tea, sugarless and milkless of\r\ncourse, but of the most exquisite flavour. The infusion is made in a\r\nsmall covered bowl; I have hardly ever seen a teapot. The outer shop\r\nis for the most part only, as it were, an advertisement, and contains\r\nnothing but trash: one of the finest shops here exhibits to the street\r\na front such as a Cheap Jack at a fair might show; but go inside,\r\nand cross a little courtyard into the inner sanctum, and you will be\r\ndazzled by the beauty of the ornaments and trinkets for sale. There\r\nis a certain black _étagère_ made of ebony, carved to represent very\r\nlight bamboo stems supporting irregular niches, filled with carved\r\nlapis-lazuli, jade, cornelians, agates, and other rare stones, that I\r\nshould like to carry off bodily. Every piece in the collection is a\r\n_chef-d’œuvre_. The prices are, of course, outrageous, but they come\r\ndown; indeed, it is curious that a people so proverbially cunning in\r\ntrade should act as they do. Supposing that they ask thirty dollars\r\nfor a thing, we offer fifteen, which, at first, will be indignantly\r\nrejected; but after perhaps three months of bargaining the man will\r\ncome down to our price, thus keeping himself for three months out of\r\nthe interest of his money. There is some beautiful porcelain, but very\r\ndear. I have never seen any of the rose-backed plates or cups that\r\nare so much prized at home; and two or three of the dealers, whom\r\nI have asked about them, had never heard of such things. There is\r\nplenty of bad cloisonné enamel about; but the fine specimens came from\r\nYuen-Ming-Yuen, and the Chinese were obliged to sell them off as fast\r\nas they could for fear of the law. (I take it the natives had a great\r\nhand in the looting.) I only know of two really magnificent pieces, for\r\nwhich the owner asks £1000! He would probably take £300, and they would\r\nbe a great bargain at the price. They are two colossal covered bowls,\r\nwithout flaw or fault, and would look splendid at Windsor or some very\r\ngreat house. I have written to a friend to tell him of them.\r\n\r\nThe best chance of picking up here and there a pretty thing is in\r\nthe minor shops, from which the bigger ones are recruited. There is\r\na street called the Liu-li-chang, which swarms with old book shops\r\n(a sort of Paternoster Row) and curiosity shops, some of which are\r\nhardly more than stalls, where sometimes one may find a piece of fine\r\nporcelain, or other work of art, for an old song.\r\n\r\nI start after to-morrow morning for Ku-Pei-Ko̔u, to see the Great Wall,\r\nand I shall return by way of the tombs of the emperors of the Ming\r\ndynasty; so at any rate I shall not have to sing the eternal refrain,\r\n“Peking is very dirty.” I shall be about eight days gone. The trip was\r\noriginally to have been undertaken with the Russian Minister, but he is\r\ndetained by business, so I go with Murray, and we accompany Saurin as\r\nfar as Ku-Pei-Ko̔u, whence he will travel into Mongolia, and Murray and\r\nI shall come back.\r\n\r\nOne more word about the Beggar’s Bridge: often one of the poor\r\ncreatures will die at his post, and I have seen the corpse lie there\r\nfor two or three days hardly covered over by a piece of rotten matting.\r\nHis troubles and miseries are over. The beggars are, I am told, a sort\r\nof guild with a recognised head, to whom it is not an infrequent custom\r\nto pay a slight annual tribute, by which means their importunities,\r\nsuch as taking up a position outside a man’s door or shop, and refusing\r\nto “move on,” may be avoided, and their piteous cry, “Ko̔ Lien! Ko̔\r\nLien!” (Have mercy! have mercy!) no longer heard. Begging throughout\r\nAsia is a fine art.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              LETTER XIII\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       PEKING, _5th September 1865_.\r\n\r\nI returned on Saturday from my trip to the Great Wall; I must try and\r\ngive you some account of it.\r\n\r\nWe started on the 25th August, as I told you before. Saurin and Frater,\r\none of the student interpreters, were going to make a journey in\r\nMongolia, and Murray and I accompanied them to the frontier.\r\n\r\nEach party had three servants—a man to look after clothes, bedding, and\r\nthings in general, a cook, and a groom; but besides these our people\r\ntook with them _their_ servant, a queer little oddity of a Chinaman,\r\nvery dirty, in an old English sailor’s pea-jacket, much too big for\r\nhim, which earned him the name of the “Skipper.” I never saw such\r\na merry, willing little creature; he was always at work and always\r\nlaughing, as if everything he did were a capital joke, and the very\r\nfact of his being in the world at all something so ridiculous that he\r\nreally couldn’t get over it.\r\n\r\nI need tell you little of our first day’s journey, as far as regards\r\nscenery. I had never seen that part of the plain which lies north-east\r\nof Peking, but it is exactly like the rest, which I have often\r\ndescribed to you. We breakfasted at a place called Sun-Ho, about\r\nthirteen miles hence; soon after that the country became prettier.\r\nWe passed some cosy villages with fine old willows; from these one\r\nis called Ku-Lin-Shu, the “Old Willow Trees,” and here we stopped to\r\nrest during the great heat of the day at the tea-shop. As usual, all\r\nthe people were very civil and talkative. One elderly man, whose name\r\nwas Ma, a Mohammedan, and evidently the village politician, was very\r\ncommunicative; he was a great Tory, and _laudator temporis acti_,\r\nabusing the present dynasty, and sighing over the “good old days” of\r\nthe Mings. I gave him a cigar, which he took with great delight, and\r\njumped up on to a little low wall, where he sat perched with his hams\r\non his heels like an old bird, and went on with his denunciation of\r\nthe Tartars. “Ugh!” said he, “they have not got a good officer among\r\nall their mandarins. They brought us into the war with foreign powers,\r\nand then when they saw the big men and the big horses, and heard the\r\npoum-poum-poum of the cannon, what did they do? Why, they ran away and\r\nleft us to pay for it all.”\r\n\r\nWe slept at a place called Niu-Lan-Shan, near which there are some\r\nmarshes with herons and wild-fowl. A Chinese inn is very unlike our\r\nnotions of an inn. It is generally built round the four sides of\r\na courtyard; the guests’ house is at the bottom, facing north and\r\nsouth. East and west are stalls for mules, horses, and donkeys; the\r\nremaining side is occupied by the people of the house. The inn-yard\r\nis very animated—carts, pigs, horses, mules, dogs, flocks of pigeons,\r\nand poultry are crowded into it, besides poor travellers, Chinese and\r\nMongol. Then there are generally a travelling barber plying his trade\r\nin one corner, a pedlar haggling for a few cash in another, and all the\r\nidle vagabonds who seem to comprise the greater part of the population\r\nof every place in Northern China, and who come in to loaf about and\r\nmake remarks about the foreigners. There is no great variety or\r\noriginality in these. There is always a fugleman, who makes a remark,\r\nand then the crowd take it up in chorus. The following is really a fair\r\nspecimen of the sort of thing they say about us:—\r\n\r\n_Fugleman_—“Those boots! They are made of scented cow’s leather”\r\n(Russia leather).\r\n\r\n_Chorus_—“Those boots! They are made of scented cow’s leather.”\r\n\r\n_Fugleman_—“Those boots! He that wears them need not fear water.”\r\n\r\n_Chorus_ (admiringly)—“Those boots! He that wears them,” etc.\r\n\r\n_Fugleman_ (to one of us)—“Those boots! How much did they cost?”\r\n\r\n_Englishman_—“They cost fourteen taels.”\r\n\r\n_Fugleman_—“Those boots! They cost fourteen taels, and he speaks the\r\nmandarin language.”\r\n\r\n_Chorus_-“They cost fourteen taels, and he speaks the mandarin\r\nlanguage”—and so it goes on _ad infinitum_. If we are in a good humour\r\nwe give the fugleman a cigar, which he puffs at vigorously, and swears\r\n“it is both strong and fragrant”; but it makes him cough violently,\r\nand he passes it on to the next in the crowd, until the whole of them\r\nretire, coughing and declaring that it is “both strong and fragrant,”\r\ninto a corner, from which every now and then we hear “those boots” all\r\nover again.\r\n\r\nThe rooms of the inn are very bare indeed; the only furniture is a\r\ntable with two chairs, and the only _vaisselle_ provided is a teapot\r\nand bowls, all guests being expected to bring their own bedding, food,\r\nand comforts. On each door is pasted a print of a god in staring\r\ncolours. The lintels and posts of the inner doors are covered with\r\ncharacters printed on red paper, which are generally moral reflections\r\nfrom the works of Confucius, such as, “All happiness comes from\r\nHeaven,” “To become wealthy you must have the principle of right.”\r\nOn the wall is generally hung a picture. I saw one of a sage with a\r\nforehead like a misshapen pear, lecturing before two warriors upon\r\nthe Yang and Yin (the universal principle of nature); another of a\r\nyellow elephant in spectacles, his body, legs, and trunk covered with\r\ncharacters, with two gentlemen in blue eating their dinner comfortably\r\nunder his stomach, while a third was offering a stalk of millet to\r\na lady in pink, who modestly turned her head aside as she accepted\r\nthe present; this was a sort of Chinese farmer’s Moore’s almanack,\r\nindicating the propitious times for sowing, reaping, etc. Besides the\r\ncentre picture, the walls are often covered with drawings by poor\r\ntravelling artists, who earn a night’s lodging by the skill of their\r\npencil. Some of their productions, when they don’t attempt figures or\r\nbeasts, are very clever. I have seen in the most out-of-the-way inns\r\nsketches of bamboo, grasses, flowers, and birds, that were dashed\r\noff in a way that would have done credit to well-known names. If\r\nthe traveller be a poor scholar, as such are always proud of their\r\ncaligraphy, he will, instead of a drawing, contribute quotations from\r\nthe philosophers or poets, or a few verses in praise of the landlord\r\nand his honesty, and declaring how his (the poor scholar’s) heart had\r\nlaughed during the period of their intercourse. Every room has in it\r\na ka̔ng; this is a large stove about 2½ feet high, covered with a mat\r\nor piece of felt, taking up all one side of the room, and serving as a\r\nbed. In winter the Chinese, like the Russians, bake themselves every\r\ntime they go to sleep.\r\n\r\nThere came on a fearful thunderstorm in the night, with a deluge of\r\nrain, which gave us some uneasiness, as we had several rivers ahead of\r\nus which we feared might become unfordable, as indeed turned out to\r\nbe the case. However, the only inconvenience we suffered was in loss\r\nof time, for when we arrived next morning at the first river we found\r\nhuge ferry-boats, worked by strapping Chinamen stark naked; it took us\r\nnearly two hours to get our carts, mules, and horses across. We amused\r\nourselves the while in watching a swine-herd’s vain endeavours to make\r\nhis flock swim the stream, the opposition being led by a stubborn\r\nlittle curly-tail, with a majority in his favour. The consumption of\r\npork at Peking must be something fabulous. The streets swarm with pigs,\r\nand yet from every direction we saw large herds being driven into the\r\ntown. The Chinese who can afford it eat pork at nearly every meal. We\r\nfound an encampment of Mongols on the river-bank. They were on their\r\nway homeward from Peking, where they had been selling horses. They\r\nseemed very good-humoured, honest people, simple and primitive to a\r\ndegree, as amused as children with our watches, clothes, saddles, and\r\nother belongings.\r\n\r\nIt is very strange, the farther one gets from the capital, to see\r\nan improvement in everything. The fields are better cultivated, the\r\nhouses are better built, and the villages far cleaner than the town.\r\nFifteen miles out of Peking all the indecencies and filthiness which\r\nare its characteristics disappear entirely; a man would be stoned if\r\nhe were to venture upon outraging decency as the Pekingese do; the\r\npoor peasants are more polite and less inquisitive about us, although\r\nforeigners so rarely appear among them, which makes one think that the\r\ninquisitiveness is sometimes only studied impertinence. We saw several\r\nfarmhouses with pretty gardens and neat out-houses, which might have\r\nstood in an English shire, so free were they from all stamp of China.\r\nThe people seemed well-to-do, and the farmers positively rich. We met\r\na lady going out to spend the day with her gossip, dressed as smart as\r\na new pin, and carrying her baby in her arms. She was riding a donkey,\r\nwhich, as soon as one of our vicious little Mongol ponies set eyes on,\r\nhe made a dash at the ass and upset him and the lady and the baby,\r\nhappily on to a bank, for had she fallen in the muddy lane there would\r\nhave been an end to all her finery. As it was, she was let off for a\r\ngood fright. “Ai ya! what manners are these! what manners are these!”\r\nshe cried indignantly as she struggled on to her tiny goat’s feet. We,\r\nof course, made all the apologies possible, and she bestrode her ass\r\nand rode off pacified—more or less.\r\n\r\nThe principal place that we passed on this day (August 26) was\r\nMi-Yün-Hsien, a walled city. We did not enter the city, but skirted the\r\nwalls. Outside the gate there stands a guard-house, and near this there\r\nis a tall blasted tree. It has neither leaf nor sprout, but from its\r\nwhitened branches there hang small wooden cages, and in each cage is a\r\nhuman head, at which the carrion-birds are pecking. A ghastly fruit!\r\n\r\nAt a little place called Shi-ling I saw the prettiest woman I have ever\r\nmet in China. She was a widow, and really looked quite lovely in her\r\nwhite dress and fillet, which she wore as weeds. She had a clear olive\r\ncomplexion, abundance of black hair, dark eyes, and regular features.\r\nWomen’s dress in this country show nothing of the figure; but we all\r\nagreed that she _must_ have had a good figure; alas! her feet had been\r\ntortured and deformed. This is commonly supposed to be the difference\r\nbetween pure Chinese women and Tartars. As a matter of fact, I am\r\nassured that it is a question of family custom, some Tartar families\r\nadopting it, while some Chinese families do not. The poor serving wench\r\nwho has her feet deformed must be sadly hampered in her work.\r\n\r\nWe slept at Mu-Chia-Yu. The next morning (August 27) we started in good\r\ntime, for we wished to reach Ku-Pei-Ko̔u early that day. Although the\r\nride of the day before had been very pretty, increasing in beauty as\r\nwe drew near to the mountains, I was hardly prepared for such glorious\r\nscenery as we passed through on this day. The road lay over and between\r\nhillocks and rocks covered with ferns, mosses, and wild-flowers, and\r\nbefore us were the mountains with blue distances and fantastic outlines\r\nfor a landscape-painter to revel in. Over the tops of the highest hills\r\nthe Great Wall of China traced a zigzag course, like a distant chain.\r\nRich crops of millet and Indian corn, with undergrowths of beans or\r\nbuckwheat, bordered with the castor-oil plant, stood in the valleys\r\nand in the plain. The cottages of the different villages had an air\r\nof comfort and tidiness rare in China; almost every one had a little\r\nflower-garden fenced in by a hedge of millet stalks, trailed over\r\nwith gourds, convolvulus, and vines. In some places the people were\r\ngathering in the smaller sort of millet; they were cutting the ears\r\nseparately with a small knife, as a gardener would gather a dish of\r\nfruit or vegetables.\r\n\r\nThe only instance of hostility towards a foreigner on the part of the\r\npeople I have met with hitherto happened on this day. Frater and I were\r\nriding about 200 yards ahead of the party when, just as we arrived at\r\na crossroad, and were doubting which way to take, up came a party of\r\nabout a dozen Chinamen with a cart. We, according to good manners,\r\n“borrowed the light of their intelligence,” and asked our way, which\r\nthey pointed out, paying us at the same time the compliment of asking\r\nwhether we had eaten our dinner. I think I told you that the common\r\nsalutation is, “Have you had your dinner?” The literal translation of\r\nthe phrase is, “Have you eaten rice.”[8] _Rice_ has passed into the\r\ngeneric term for all meals. _Early rice_ is breakfast, _late rice_ is\r\ndinner. _The rice is prepared_ is the equivalent of Mr. Bailey Junior’s\r\n“the wittles is up.” In short, amenity and deportment could be pushed\r\nno further. To our surprise a few moments after Saurin and Murray\r\nrode up looking hot and angry, and asking us whether we had had any\r\ndifficulty with these same men. It appeared that, as Saurin was riding\r\npast the cart, the man inside, in the most unprovoked way, struck him\r\nin the chest with his brass pipe. Murray was riding just behind him\r\nand saw the blow struck, and from their account of what took place I\r\ndoubt whether the man will ever insult a foreigner again. His friends\r\nall took part against him, but interceded for him, crying, “Be calm, be\r\ncalm; he has had enough.” At any rate he got a good whipping.\r\n\r\nThe sun was scorching hot, and it was a great relief to come upon a\r\npretty village-green, at one end of which stood a small tea-shop,\r\nshaded by a covering of millet-straw and by a broad-spreading tree: our\r\nhorses needed a rest as much as ourselves; they had been driven nearly\r\nmad by the flies and by one venomous little insect in particular,\r\nwhich must have been the original gadfly that persecuted Io. It has\r\na long sheath in its tail, out of which it shoots a sting into the\r\nhorses’ flanks, apparently out of pure mischief, for it never seems to\r\nsuck them, and it follows a horse or mule for miles. If one attacked\r\nour horses, the only way to get rid of it was to dismount and kill it.\r\nSo sharp is its sting that every time it touched our beasts they jumped\r\nup as if they had been shot. We were all glad of a friendly shelter.\r\n\r\nWe found a party of Chinamen playing dominoes. They were playing the\r\ngame more as we do cards than dominoes, but I could not make out the\r\nprinciple of it. The landlord was a very jolly, burly fellow, the\r\npicture of a host with whom everything prospered, although he must\r\nhave been poor enough, for instead of tea he was drinking an infusion\r\nof dried leaves of jujube that is common on the hills. In some places\r\nwhere there is no tea to be had the people drink a sort of barley\r\nwater, and very good it is. At these tea-shops guests are expected to\r\nbring their own tea-leaves. The house supplies only the pot and the\r\nboiling water.\r\n\r\nAlmost every man and woman (I am not exaggerating) that we met in\r\nthis part of the valley had goitres, not so bad as those one meets in\r\nthe Swiss valleys, but far more numerous. In one village we saw eight\r\nfullgrown men and women only—out of the eight seven had goitres.\r\n\r\nOverlooking the village-green I mentioned above is a fort commanding\r\nthe plain; and on one side of the fort the road has been cut through\r\nthe solid rock and arched over with strong masonry, so as to form a\r\ngate, which bears the legend, “The Gate of the Southern Heavens.”\r\nThrough this gate there is a most gorgeous view of the different\r\nranges, the Great Wall, and the approach to Ku-Pei-Ko̔u.\r\n\r\nKu-Pei-Ko̔u is in its way one of the most strikingly beautiful places\r\nthat I have ever seen. The valley by which it is reached, with rocks,\r\nferns, mosses, gardens, and a little rivulet sparkling in the sunlight,\r\nis a gem. The town itself stands in a little nest among the hills which\r\nsurround it; on one side of it runs a river, on the farther bank of\r\nwhich, in a grove of trees, is the yamên or official residence of the\r\nTi-tu (the general officer commanding the district). There is not a\r\npoint in the whole place from which there is not something attractive\r\nto rest one’s eyes on. The streets are clean, the houses well built,\r\nand the shops seem to do a prosperous business. At one end of the town\r\nis the frontier gate of China; it is strongly guarded, and ingress or\r\negress without passport is forbidden. Besides the walls of the city, as\r\na guard against Mongol tribes, on the river side are two little ditches\r\nthat a man might easily hop over, and two little pieces of cannon which\r\nlook more dangerous to friend than to foe. We walked outside the gate\r\nto stand beyond the confines of China proper. The guard were extremely\r\ncivil, the sentry politely inviting us into the guard-room to drink\r\ntea! The Chinese attach a great deal of importance to Ku-Pei-Ko̔u as a\r\nborder fortress. They keep up a garrison of two thousand men, of whom\r\nten per cent are Tartars and the rest Chinese.\r\n\r\nThe inn here is the largest I have been in yet. The enormous traffic\r\nwhich passes through the town keeps its business brisk. The landlord\r\nwas a Tientsing man, and a man of letters, having taken the degree\r\nequivalent to our B.A. Degrees in China are conferred by competitive\r\nexamination, only a certain number of candidates being elected each\r\ntime. The examinations are held at Peking, and people come from all\r\nparts of the empire to compete. Some time back an old gentleman aged\r\n100 presented himself from the south for examination. He received the\r\ndegree of B.A. by Imperial favour, and with it a present of 2 lbs. of\r\ngin-seng, which is a powerful aphrodisiac and tonic. It is from the\r\nsuccessful candidates that the offices of the empire are filled, and\r\nin former days it was the highest ambition of a Chinaman to pass the\r\nschools in order to qualify himself for office. Now, however, a race\r\nhas sprung up of men who are indifferent to public honours, and prefer\r\ntheir private advantage. Of these was our host. Why, he argued, should\r\nhe go through all the petty annoyances and humiliations which inferior\r\nmandarins suffer at the hands of their superiors for the possible\r\nchance of rising to distinction, when he could enjoy certain comfort\r\nin trade? Many people deny the existence of this feeling among the\r\nlettered class, but it exists nevertheless. Office, both civil and\r\nmilitary, can also be obtained by purchase.\r\n\r\nAs I was sitting smoking and reading an old number of a magazine\r\noutside my room, the landlord came up and began asking me many\r\nquestions about what I was reading, and why we read from left to right\r\ninstead of in columns from right to left. About half an hour after I\r\nheard him in the inn-yard delivering a lecture to an admiring audience\r\nof grooms, muleteers, and riffraff, upon the English language, the\r\npoint of which was that we wrote exactly as the Manchus do, who write\r\nin columns from left to right! Seeing me come he borrowed my book and\r\nproceeded to give practical illustrations of what he had said, holding\r\nit upside down. This exhibition of learning was received with awe by\r\nthe gaping crowd. He was a great character, this same landlord, a\r\nconfirmed opium smoker, and being a man of letters, which is something\r\nmore thought of here than being of good birth is in Europe, he had an\r\nimmense number of friends and acquaintances of good standing of whom\r\nhe was very proud. He took me into his own little house, which he had\r\npapered completely with the crimson visiting-cards of his intimates.\r\n\r\nOur first object at Ku-Pei-Ko̔u was to get the seal of the Ti-tu\r\naffixed as a _visa_ to our passports. All over the provinces of China\r\nthe central authorities count as nothing in comparison with the local;\r\na small mandarin who would laugh to scorn the seal of the Imperial\r\nForeign Office will bow to the earth before that of his immediate\r\nsuperior. Accordingly, on the evening of our arrival we sent our\r\nShao-To, the apostle, to the Yamên with our cards to beg the Ti-tu\r\nto grant us his seal. He came back discomfited, not having been able\r\neven to see an official of any rank. The next morning, however, he\r\nproposed to return to the charge, and arraying himself in his best,\r\nwith his head shaven and his tail freshly plaited, he ordered out one\r\nof the carts and called upon the skipper to attend him. Here arose a\r\ndifficulty: our servants all declared that the skipper must abandon\r\nhis old pea-jacket as unbefitting the dignity of the situation; he as\r\nfirmly stuck to wearing it, but public opinion was too strong for him,\r\nand he was forced to give up his favourite garment and appear in a\r\ndirty nankin jacket. In spite of the imposing splendour of this embassy\r\nit was fruitless, the authorities declaring that they had received\r\nno special instructions from Peking, and that without them they could\r\nnot grant the seal. This was very provoking; the seal was necessary to\r\nus, we had a right to ask for it, and we were determined to have it,\r\nthe more especially as if we, holding an official position here, had\r\nforegone our rights, other travellers would necessarily have had double\r\ndifficulty in obtaining it in future. Murray determined to go himself\r\nand demand to see the Ti-tu. He was shown into a dirty room full of\r\nsoldiers, and the Chinese tried to foist a wretched white-buttoned\r\nmandarin upon him as the Ti-tu. He of course was not to be taken in\r\nby this childish piece of chicanery, and as soon as it became evident\r\nthat he knew what he was about the big doors were thrown open, and he\r\nwas ushered with due solemnity into the presence of the Ti-tu, who\r\nmade many apologies for having kept him waiting, and received him with\r\nmuch ceremony. Murray had the satisfaction of being served with tea\r\nand sweetmeats by the very impostor who had tried to pass himself off\r\nas the great man! About the question of putting on the seal the Ti-tu\r\nfenced for a long while. He had no orders. He might get into a scrape.\r\nWhat right had we to ask it? Murray explained the treaty to him, and\r\nhe admitted our claim. But no sooner were the passports produced than\r\nhe raised another objection. The seal of the British Legation was\r\nin the centre, that of the Imperial Foreign Office on the left, and\r\nthere was no more room on the left of that again for his seal—what\r\ncould be done? His rank was too high for his seal to be placed below.\r\n“Well,” said Murray, “put your seal on the right of ours, and then we\r\nshall be figuratively between the protection of the civil and military\r\nauthorities of China.” This little bit of nonsense was the very thing\r\nto please the Chinese mind, and the seal was set without more delay,\r\nMurray undertaking to explain the matter at Peking. “I know you’ll do\r\nit,” said the Ti-tu, “for when an Englishman promises a thing he does\r\nit.”\r\n\r\nI mention this to show you how business is transacted in China.\r\nThe most important affairs are conducted with the same amount of\r\nchildishness and trickery as our little passport difficulty with the\r\nTi-tu of Ku-Pei-Ko̔u, who, be it recollected, is an officer of the\r\nhighest rank.\r\n\r\nWe spent the afternoon on the Great Wall. The Chinese name for\r\nthis most marvellous work is Wan-Li-Cha̔ng-Che̔ng—literally the\r\nmyriad-li-long wall. Calculating the li at a third of a mile, this\r\nname would give it a length of nearly 3400 miles, but the English\r\nbooks estimate it at 1250 miles. It was built by the Emperor Shih\r\nof the Chi̔n dynasty about 230 years b.c. as a barrier against the\r\nnorthern tribes, or more probably as an evidence of power. He was the\r\nsame Emperor who burnt the books of the sages, thus rendering himself\r\nfamous by two works—one of construction, the other of destruction. The\r\nwall near Ku-Pei-Ko̔u is for the most part in very good repair, but in\r\nother places it is little more than a heap of rubbish; where we saw\r\nit, it is built of large blocks of granite, huge bricks and cement,\r\nand the centre filled in with rubble and concrete. It is some fifteen\r\nfeet broad and twenty feet high; at regular intervals are quadrilateral\r\ntowers about forty feet high, built of granite with embrasures—some\r\nof these are quite perfect, others in ruin; wild vines, asparagus,\r\nbluebells, low shrubs, and other plants grow in profusion among the\r\ndébris, and the towers are covered with silver-backed ferns and\r\nmosses. For miles and miles as far as our eyes could stretch, up hill\r\nand down dale, up precipices almost perpendicular, and over the highest\r\npeaks, we traced the course of the wall; when we thought we had fairly\r\nlost sight of it our glasses would light on some distant crag carrying\r\nit on still farther. How so much material could have been got together\r\nin such wild and inaccessible spots is a marvel.\r\n\r\nEven without the attraction of the Great Wall, the height on which we\r\nstood would have been well worth visiting. Range above range of hills\r\nrose all round us; on one side were the wilds of Mongolia, on the other\r\nthe plains of China. At our feet lay the little town with its absurd\r\nfortification and ditches and cannon, and the river flowing past it.\r\nThe mountain view was only bounded by the limits of our sight.\r\n\r\nWe lingered long on the wall, looking and wondering at the beauty of\r\nthe scene. We gathered some ferns and mosses, of which I send you\r\nsome, and by dint of hardish work, for it was no light weight to carry\r\nunder a broiling sun, I managed to bring off a trophy in the shape of\r\none of the big bricks. I have got it safe in my room here, after many\r\nvicissitudes, for it was often nearly left behind, and some day I hope\r\nto take it home.\r\n\r\nWe left Ku-Pei-Ko̔u the next morning, going our several ways—Saurin and\r\nFrater to Mongolia, Murray and I to the Tombs of the Mings, which I\r\nmust tell you about in another letter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The symbol of Yang and Yin]\r\n\r\nAs you interest yourself about Chinese curiosities and antiquities, I\r\nwill add a few words about the Yang and Yin, to which I alluded in the\r\nearly part of my letter.\r\n\r\nYou may have noticed on old porcelain and other ornaments this device.\r\nIt is the symbol of Yang and Yin, the universal male and female\r\nprinciple of creation to which everything is referred. The celestial\r\nprinciple is male, the terrestrial female; even plants are male and\r\nfemale, without reference, of course, to the sexual system of Linnæus;\r\nodd numbers are male, even numbers female. Day and the sun male, night\r\nand the moon female. Parts of the body, the lungs, the heart, the\r\nliver, etc., each have a sex. Sir John Davis compares with this the\r\nEgyptian and Brahmin mythologies (_The Chinese_, vol. ii. p. 67).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               LETTER XIV\r\n\r\n\r\n                                          PEKING, _25th Sept. 1865_.\r\n\r\nIn my last letter I told you how we went to Ku-Pei-Ko̔u. We turned\r\nhomewards (that I should talk of Peking as home!) on the 29th of\r\nAugust. I began my backward journey unluckily. My horse had a sore\r\nback, which no nostrum in the pharmacopœia of a dirty old Chinese\r\nveterinary surgeon could heal in time for me to ride him, so I had to\r\ngo in a cart. Our first day’s journey was back over the road by which\r\nwe had arrived as far as Mi-Yün-Hsien, a distance of five-and-thirty\r\nmiles—no great things, to be sure; but the average pace was three miles\r\nan hour; the road was full of deep ruts, and rendered doubly uneven\r\nby rocky passages and big stones. The carts have no springs; at every\r\njolt I was banged up against the hard sides, and by the evening my\r\nback was as sore as my horse’s. After ten hours of a Chinese cart\r\na man is fit for little else than to be sold at an old rag and bone\r\nshop. Misfortunes never come single; when I arrived at Mi-Yün-Hsien,\r\njaded and aching in every bone, the inns refused to take us in; this\r\nwas of very small account, for persuasion and threats soon brought the\r\npeople to reason. The only cause they had to give for their reluctance\r\nto house us, was that last year some foreigners had stayed there, and\r\ninstead of paying for their night’s lodging had beaten the landlord\r\nwhen he asked for his money; such are some of the travellers who come\r\nto these parts, and who defeat all our efforts to conciliate the\r\npeople. However, we convinced the host that we neither wished to cheat\r\nnor to beat him, and he, when he felt safe on both scores, was willing\r\nenough to be civil. But during the altercation, which had attracted a\r\ngreat crowd, my pocket-book was picked out of my pocket, which was a\r\nserious loss, for it contained a heap of notes, rough sketches, and\r\nplans, that I had made on different excursions, and our passport. We\r\noffered a reward for its recovery, and sent to the Chih-hsien, or\r\ngovernor of the town, to ask his help, which he sent in the shape of\r\ntwo officers, who came and knelt before us very humbly, but offered no\r\nsuggestions for getting back my book, which I shall now certainly never\r\nsee again.\r\n\r\nWe had two days’ journey from Mi-Yün-Hsien to Chang-Ping-Chou. As the\r\nroad lay on one side of the highway, the villages were smaller, poorer,\r\nand more insignificant than any we had come to yet. By the richness of\r\ntheir crops, the people here ought to be among the most prosperous, but\r\nthey are so taxed by the Government, and bled by the mandarins, small\r\nand great, that they have no chance. Wherever we went the people were\r\ncomplaining of their hard lot; nor was this mere talk, for since our\r\nreturn to Peking there has been a serious outbreak not far from the\r\npart of the country that we had travelled over. The insurrection, if it\r\ndeserved the name, has been happily quelled, but not before the rioters\r\nhad done great damage, making themselves masters of two small towns;\r\nand it was even said that they had killed the governor of one town, but\r\nthis was afterwards contradicted. The affair was merely an additional\r\nproof of the tyranny of the petty rulers, and the hatred with which the\r\npeople regard them. “A town priest and a country mandarin” are the\r\ntypes of good luck, says the proverb; for the one is the darling of the\r\nwomen, the other can feather his nest handsomely.\r\n\r\nIt is very curious in this country to come upon roadside shrines just\r\nlike those one sees in the “pious Tyrol” and other Roman Catholic\r\ncountries. Those which are erected in honour of the goddess of\r\nmercy, Kwang-Yin, with a babe in her arms, or the Queen of Heaven,\r\nTi̔en-Hou, are the very counterpart of the effigies of the Madonna and\r\nBambino. The majority of these shrines are faced by a low whitewashed\r\nblank wall. This often is covered by an allegorical design of great\r\nquaintness, in which the dragon plays a prominent part. The dragon\r\nis the principle of good, and he is engaged in constant warfare with\r\nthe serpent or the tiger, who represent the principle of evil. These\r\nbattles are a common subject for the decoration of the blank walls of\r\nshrines. Apropos of the dragon and serpent, the Chinese have a quaint\r\nsuperstition. They believe that thunderstorms are created by the dragon\r\npursuing the tiger or serpent through the air, hurling bolts and fiery\r\ndarts at him. It is very dangerous to stand at open windows or in an\r\nexposed place during a thunderstorm, for the serpent and tiger are very\r\ncrafty, and have cunning ways of dodging the dragon’s shots, which thus\r\nfall on an innocent head. The tiger, who is drawn as a vicious-looking\r\ncat, with his back up, lives to a great age; when he has attained his\r\nthousandth birthday, he throws off his teeth and puts on a pair of\r\nhorns. The existence of such fables is not to be wondered at, for there\r\nare old women’s tales everywhere; what is delightful here is that some\r\nof the educated men really believe in them.\r\n\r\nChang-Ping-Chou was the scene of the great tragedy of 1860, the death\r\nof the English prisoners from the effects of the barbarities of their\r\ncaptors. It is a singular fact that the only one of the mandarins\r\nconnected with those murders who is still alive has been disgraced and\r\nbanished. The others have died miserably; one was executed in gaol\r\nfor contumely to the Empress, on the very day on which, expecting his\r\npardon, he had invited his wives and family to go to the prison and\r\nfetch him away; another was killed, as it is said, by his own soldiers.\r\nThe retribution has been complete. The Sikh soldiers who survived the\r\ncruelties to which they were subjected, and who gave the account of\r\nwhat had happened, described Chang-Ping-Chou as a walled city as big\r\nas Tientsing; but this is a mistake; it is a small walled city, very\r\nprettily situated with hills on three sides of it; on the top of one of\r\nthese is a temple which the Sikhs mistook for a fort, as they easily\r\nmight. The little town looks prosperous enough, and appeared to be\r\ndoing a brisk trade in coffins (I never saw so many in any one place in\r\nmy life) and the water-tight wicker-work buckets, which are to my mind\r\nthe most ingenious production of North China.\r\n\r\nThe Shih-san-Ling, or thirteen tombs of the Ming dynasty, are about\r\nfive miles distant from Chang-Ping-Chou. It was the burial-place of\r\nthose emperors of the dynasty who reigned after the removal of the\r\nseat of the Empire from Nanking to Peking. The first sign that we were\r\napproaching something remarkable was a magnificent stone gateway, built\r\nof enormous blocks of stone and standing isolated in the midst of the\r\nplain. This gateway is the finest specimen of Chinese architecture\r\nthat I have seen. Some way beyond this is a second gateway of brick,\r\nroofed with the imperial tiles, also very handsome, and this leads\r\nto a large square granite building, cruciform inside, containing a\r\ncolossal marble tortoise, from whose back springs a marble tablet of\r\ngreat height, bearing an inscription on both sides, the one relating\r\nhow the tombs were built by the Ming dynasty, the other how they were\r\nrestored in the reign of Chien-Lung. This building is surrounded by\r\nfour triumphal columns. Next follows an avenue of colossal figures in\r\nmarble,—grim sentries over the approach to the sepulchres. The figures\r\ncome in the following order:—Two lions sitting, two lions standing;\r\ntwo chi-lings (a fabulous beast which appears once in ten thousand\r\nyears, and was last seen at the birth of Confucius. Chi-ling is the\r\nsame as kylin, which we in England misapply to designate the porcelain\r\nand bronze lions with curly manes which are imported; these latter are\r\ncalled by the Chinese shih-tszŭ; as you have a pair, I thought this\r\nmight interest you), two chi-lings sitting; two camels sitting, two\r\ncamels standing; two elephants sitting, two elephants standing; two\r\nscaled beasts with wings and wreathed in flames sitting, two of the\r\nsame standing; two horses standing, two horses resting; two warriors\r\nin full armour, prepared for battle, with breastplates that reminded\r\none of Medusa’s head, and carrying swords and maces; two warriors in\r\nrepose, their swords sheathed and their hands crossed on their breasts;\r\nfour councillors in their caps and robes of office; four chamberlains.\r\nWe passed through this mysterious assemblage, which was very terrifying\r\nto our horses, and then had about a mile and a half to go along a\r\nruined stone road, with decayed stone and marble bridges, before we\r\ngot to the tombs. Each tomb is of itself a palace. The thirteen stand\r\nin an amphitheatre of hills among groves of cypresses and persimmon\r\ntrees. The tombs are about three-quarters of a mile apart. The plain\r\nis cultivated now, but evidently it was originally intended that the\r\nwhole place should be silent, solitary, and secluded. Nothing can be\r\nmore beautiful than the situation. As I told you once before, in this\r\ncountry the fairest spots are chosen for burying the dead, and you may\r\nsuppose that the emperors of the magnificent Ming dynasty would not be\r\nbehind their people in this.\r\n\r\nThe tomb which is generally visited by strangers, and which I saw,\r\nis that of the Emperor Yung-Lo; it is the oldest and _par excellence_\r\n“the Great Tomb.” The Emperor Tae-Tsung, who reigned under the style\r\nof Yung-Lo, was the third of his dynasty; he reigned during the first\r\nquarter of the fifteenth century. It was he who moved the capital\r\nfrom Nanking to Peking. Of the thirteen emperors of his dynasty who\r\nsucceeded him, twelve are buried round him; the thirteenth, who, when\r\nPeking was taken by the rebels, committed suicide in his harem after\r\nkilling his wives and children, with the exception of one daughter, is\r\nmissing.\r\n\r\nThe Tomb-Palace is, of course, surrounded by a high red wall tiled with\r\nyellow, the imperial colours. A broad and handsome entrance gate leads\r\ninto a large courtyard; on the right is a pavilion containing a marble\r\ntortoise carrying a high marble slab with a commemorative inscription.\r\nPast this court is a vast entrance hall. Two flights of steps lead up\r\nto the hall, and between them is a slant of marble richly carved and\r\nornamented; I believe that this centre path is for the good spirits to\r\nwalk along. A second courtyard contains two beautiful little yellow\r\nshrines, both empty. A triple terrace of marble, with steps and slants\r\nas before, precedes the grand hall, a most imposing chamber. It is 81\r\npaces long by 36 broad, and very lofty. The floor is of black marble,\r\nthe walls a dull yellow; the roof, which is fretted and painted like\r\ncloisonné enamel with dragons and other emblems, is supported by\r\nthirty-six huge masts of wood, smoothed but unpolished, and all of\r\nequal size. They are marvellously handsome, and in this country (where\r\nwood is so precious that an empty house is not safe for a night from\r\nthieves, who will strip it of roof, doors, and windows) must have\r\ncost something prodigious. In the centre of the hall is rather a mean\r\nshrine in honour of “our ancestor canonised under the name of Wên.”\r\nEvery emperor passes through three names. First he has his own name,\r\nwhich, after he ascends the throne, is never used nor borne again, for\r\nhe then assumes the style of his reign, and at his death is canonised\r\nunder a third. So this Emperor’s name was Tai-Tsung; he reigned under\r\nthe style of Yung-Lo, and was finally canonised as Wên. After this\r\ngrand hall come two more courtyards; in one of these stands a great\r\nsacrificial altar of stone and marble. The top block of marble is eight\r\npaces long; on this altar are placed the five gifts—an incense-burner,\r\ntwo candlesticks, and two pots of fruits. Inside the altar is a tank of\r\nfresh water, which is got at by passing a stick with a piece of linen\r\nattached to it as a sponge through a hole in the side. This water is\r\na specific for certain complaints. The last building is a high tower,\r\nwith a vaulted passage springing off into two directions. I never heard\r\nsuch an echo as this produced; we two, as we walked along, made a noise\r\nlike that of a regiment. From the top of the tower, which contains a\r\nlarge perpendicular slab of marble painted red, there is a beautiful\r\nview over the country, with the thirteen palaces of the dead each in\r\nits niche in the hills; it is really a scene of rare and striking\r\nbeauty. Just behind the tower is an artificial mound covered with trees\r\nand verdure; this, I believe, is where the body lies—a few old bones to\r\nall this magnificence. There is a Chinese proverb which says, “Better\r\nbe a living beggar covered with sores than a dead emperor.”\r\n\r\nAs we were sitting over our dinner at the inn we both agreed that as\r\nit was a lovely moonlight night we would go back at any rate as far\r\nas the avenue of colossal statues. I never saw anything so weird as\r\nthe big beasts and warriors looked; they almost seemed to move in the\r\nmoonlight—one half expected one of them to come down from his pedestal,\r\nlike the Commendatore in _Don Giovanni_, and punish us for the\r\nintrusion. It is impossible to imagine a wilder or more lonely spot; it\r\nis really the solitude of the tomb.\r\n\r\nThe next morning at daybreak we rode into Peking, about 25 miles. I\r\nhave seen nothing so interesting since I have been in China as the\r\nscenes of which I have tried to give you an idea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               LETTER XV\r\n\r\n\r\n                                        PEKING, _25th October 1865_.\r\n\r\nI who so lately wrote to you about blazing sun and scorching heat am\r\nnow glad to nestle into the chimney-corner and watch the “pictures in\r\nthe fire.” Outside, the rain is falling fitfully and the wind blowing\r\na hurricane; it moans and howls dismally through the courts and cranky\r\nbuildings of the Legation, piercing its way into all sorts of odd\r\nnooks, and routing out old bells that jangle in a harsh and discordant\r\nway from the quaint eaves, as if they were angry at being disturbed\r\nin their dusty dens. Doors are creaking and timbers groaning in every\r\ndirection, and the windows threaten to burst in, but the stout Corean\r\npaper holds good, though it gets stretched and flaps unpleasantly like\r\nloose sails in a calm, and on the whole I confess I prefer glass. Every\r\nnow and then, as the storm abates for a while, I hear the tap, tap,\r\ntap, of the watchman’s bamboo as he goes his rounds, and can’t help\r\ngrunting with Lucretian satisfaction as I look at my fire and think of\r\nhow cold he must be. In short, we are working gradually into winter. In\r\nanother fortnight the trees will all be bare, and Peking, throwing off\r\nthe green clothes which it puts on in summer, in order to delude stray\r\nvisitors into the idea that it is a pretty place, will stand naked,\r\ndirty, and ashamed. The last month has been very pleasant—neither too\r\nhot nor too cold; and the early morning rides, before wind or dust has\r\narisen, and when the evil smells of the town, which are beaten down by\r\nthe night dews, have not had time to assert themselves again, put fresh\r\nlife into us after the great heats. I have got a new horse. The first\r\none which I bought in the spring turned out to be possessed of every\r\nvice to which horse-flesh is heir; so I sold him at a loss, after he\r\nhad bored my life out for four months, and am now well mounted on a\r\nfirst-rate Mongol cob.\r\n\r\nTalking of horses leads me to dogs. I have had a sad loss in my little\r\ndog Nou-nou, of whom I was very fond. I told you what a little Turk he\r\nwas, always getting himself into scrapes about his amours. Well, the\r\nother day he had some words with a big dog belonging to the sergeant of\r\nour escort, which ended in his getting a bite in the back that broke\r\nhis spine and killed him. Everybody in the Legation regrets him, poor\r\nlittle beast; he had been at Peking ever since the foreign Legations\r\nfirst came here, and was quite a character about the place. I was very\r\nmuch grieved at his death.\r\n\r\nWe have been interested lately in the steps taken by the Russian\r\nGovernment to establish a telegraph from Kiachta to Peking and\r\nTientsing. The Russians wish that it should be a Chinese enterprise,\r\nbut that they, the Russians, should set it up and help in working\r\nit. Accordingly, they have sent an officer of engineers here with a\r\ncomplete apparatus to show the Chinese Government. It is set up in\r\nthe gardens of the Russian Legation. Some four years ago, when Baron\r\nGros returned to Europe, he sent out to the Prince of Kung a present\r\nof an electric telegraphic apparatus. Such was the horror which the\r\nChinese then had of innovations, that the Prince not only refused to\r\naccept it, but even to see it. Now, however, the Government is more\r\nripe for taking impressions from abroad. The members of the Foreign\r\nOffice, and afterwards the Prince, have been to see the machine work,\r\nalthough the Prince took good care not to allow that his visit had any\r\nspecial purpose, and with that view went the round of all the Legations\r\nthe same day. He watched the working of the telegraph without showing\r\nany great astonishment or perception of what was going on; but a few\r\ndays afterwards M. Vlangaly, the Russian Minister, who had drawn up\r\nfor the Prince a paper upon the subject of the international utility\r\nof telegraphs, received a very satisfactory despatch from the Foreign\r\nOffice to the effect that one visit was not enough to enable the\r\nMinisters to appreciate so wonderful an invention, and that they hoped\r\nto be allowed to see it again. M. Vlangaly has had the happy idea of\r\nhaving some intelligent Chinese lads taught to work the telegraph, so\r\nnext time the Prince comes he will see that his own people can learn to\r\nsend off and take down messages. This is all a great step in advance.\r\nThe French, who are always on the look-out to find that other Powers\r\nare extending their “influence,” as they call it, and in this case\r\nhave the additional motive for jealousy in the refusal of Baron Gros’\r\npresent, look upon this move of the Russians with great distrust and\r\ndislike. We, on the contrary, are all for supporting any Power who will\r\nhelp the Chinese to move forwards. The superstitions of the people\r\nwould be a great difficulty in the way of carrying out telegraphs,\r\nrailroads, or any great engineering project in China. They would view\r\nwith the utmost horror anything which might disturb places deemed\r\nsacred, lucky, or unlucky. They have a regular system for determining\r\npropitious places, manners of building, and the like. This they call\r\n“Fêng Shui,” the wind and water system, and it is universally believed\r\nin. No Chinaman, however educated, would inhabit a new house without\r\nascertaining that it fulfilled all the requirements laid down in the\r\nbooks which treat of “Fêng Shui.” Some time ago one of our men was\r\nill; our chief teacher, a man of great learning as Chinamen go, said\r\nquietly to Wade that it must be owing to a new chimney which had been\r\nbuilt opposite to the sick man’s room, but about a hundred and fifty\r\nyards off. Any work which might be undertaken here must be carried out\r\nwith all respect to the “Fêng Shui,” or it would run the risk of being\r\ndestroyed. Graves and other sacred places must also not be interfered\r\nwith. In carrying any engineering project into execution, the best\r\nplan would be for the engineer to lay down his line and employ Chinese\r\nexperts in such matters to see how nearly it could be followed.\r\n\r\nI have rather a good story to tell you. One of our subjects of\r\ncomplaint at the Chinese Foreign Office has been our being insulted\r\nin the streets of Peking by the riffraff of the place. Their means of\r\nannoyance is to howl out “Kwei-tzŭ” (devils) after us when our backs\r\nare turned, and then, of course, to look as if they had not done it.\r\nWell, the other day M. de Mas, the Spanish Minister, being about to\r\nleave Peking, exchanged compliments p.p.c. with all the members of the\r\nForeign Board. Amongst them all Hêng-Chi distinguished himself by his\r\n_empressement_, sending M. de Mas a magnificent dinner _à la Chinoise_.\r\nM. de Mas went to thank him, and after the two old gentlemen had\r\nexchanged banalities to their hearts’ content, the Spaniard knowing\r\nthat Hêng-Chi had a little son, the child of his old age, of whom he\r\nwas inordinately proud, thought it would be a very pretty compliment if\r\nhe asked to see the little boy, who was accordingly produced, sucking\r\nhis thumb after the manner of his years. Him his father ordered to\r\npay his respects to M. de Mas—that is to say, shake his united fists\r\nat him in token of salutation, instead of which the child, after long\r\nsilence and much urging, taking his thumb deliberately out of his\r\nmouth, roared out “Kwei-tzŭ” at the top of his voice and fled. Imagine\r\nthe consternation of the two old twaddles! Hêng-Chi was horrified, for\r\nafter all his protestations of friendship to us, which by the bye took\r\nnobody in, it bored him not a little that we should find out that his\r\nchild was brought up in the privacy of his harem to look upon us as\r\ndevils.\r\n\r\nA French missionary has been murdered in the province of Ssŭ-Chuan,\r\nin the extreme west. It is said that there are 800,000 Christians in\r\nthe province. There have been persecutions and disturbances on their\r\naccount of late, and the Government of Peking will have to take very\r\nactive steps in the matter, or the French will be down upon them. The\r\ncentral Government are always slow in punishing their provincial\r\nauthorities, whom they fear; and in this instance they will be the more\r\nreluctant, as the governor of the province is a man who has done them\r\ngood service as an administrator.\r\n\r\nWe hear rumours of reforms in China. If the present dynasty is to be\r\npreserved and China to remain independent, they must be brought about\r\nquickly, for the moment is critical. Nothing can be more rotten and\r\ncorrupt than every branch of the administration, nothing can be more\r\nfaithless than the conduct of the Chinese towards foreigners. With\r\nmisery and discontent at home, and angry reclamations for breaches of\r\ntreaty from abroad, the Government are beginning to tremble for their\r\nexistence. If the remedy does not come soon it will be too late.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               LETTER XVI\r\n\r\n\r\n                                        PEKING, _5th November 1865_.\r\n\r\nI was awakened this morning by such a noise of squibs, crackers,\r\npetards, maroons, bombs, cannon, and all manner of fireworks, that I\r\nrubbed my eyes and was half inclined to fancy that some good fairy\r\nhad transported me back to England, where Guy Fawkes’ day was being\r\ncelebrated on a scale of unprecedented splendour. Not, however, that\r\nfireworks are a matter of astonishment here—they are going on at all\r\nhours of the day and night; our opposite neighbour, the Prince of Su,\r\nis continually letting off pieces which, to judge from the noise they\r\nmake, would make the bouquet at Cremorne look very foolish. Fireworks\r\nand sweetmeats are the favourite dissipation of the Pekingese; the\r\nladies especially take great delight in them, burning and sucking away\r\nimmense sums. To-day Peking out-heroded itself: never was heard such\r\na fizzing, cracking, popping, and banging; for this is the seventeenth\r\nday of the ninth moon, and although the Gunpowder Plot was never heard\r\nof here, and if it had been would not have produced any extraordinary\r\nsensation, still it is an occasion upon which every devout and proper\r\nChinaman is bound to burn as many squibs as he can afford, or more;\r\nfor the seventeenth day of the ninth moon is the birthday of a certain\r\nlittle pousa or god, by name Tsai-shên. Now this little god is a\r\nvery great little god, being intimately connected with tradespeople,\r\nand especially with their profits; and as tradespeople here are very\r\nnumerous, and all have a natural weakness for profits, a great many\r\ncrackers and squibs are expended to do this little god honour and\r\nservice—of course _à titre de revanche_; moreover, scraps of paper\r\nupon which are written or printed characters of good omen are burnt\r\nand scattered to the winds. Furthermore, this little god having been\r\nduring his lifetime on earth connected with the Mohammedan religion,\r\nit is also a matter of decency to eat and invite him to eat mutton\r\nall day, for pork would evidently be an insult to him, while beef\r\nwould be a deep personal affront to Buddha, but mutton satisfies all\r\nparties, including the eaters, provided that they have enough of it. I\r\nhave mentioned this because it seemed to me noteworthy that at the two\r\nends of our hemisphere the same day should this year be from different\r\ncauses celebrated somewhat in the same way.\r\n\r\nThe little Emperor leaves Peking to-day for the Tung-Ling, the tombs of\r\nthe emperors of this dynasty. He goes to place his father’s coffin in\r\nthe tomb which has been prepared for it, and which has taken four years\r\nto build. It is a great state occasion. The Emperor will be accompanied\r\nby the Prince of Kung, and all the court and chief ministers, with\r\nthe exception of Wen Hsiang, who is the real Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs. He remains to take charge of the capital. I shall be able\r\nto tell you nothing about the procession, for on these occasions the\r\nmembers of the Legations receive an official notification not to show\r\nthemselves in certain streets between certain hours. Indeed, the whole\r\nthing is conducted within the city with as much secrecy and mystery as\r\nthe Princess Badroulbadour’s procession to the bath in the _Arabian\r\nNights_; shops are closed and shutters put up, and the streets are\r\ncleared along the line of march, for there is no saying what harm might\r\nhappen to the state if a citizen of Peking were to catch a glimpse of\r\nthe outside of the chair in which his Emperor is being carried. The\r\nconsistency of the Chinese in this as in other matters is remarkable,\r\nfor once the cavalcade is outside the city walls any lout may go\r\nand gape at it. The public gains one advantage from these Imperial\r\nprogresses. The roads over which His Majesty is to pass are repaired,\r\nfor it would never do for Imperial bones to be shaken and Imperial\r\neyes offended by such roads as are good enough for “the hundred names”\r\n(which is the Chinese expression for the common people).\r\n\r\nThe Chinese-Mesopotamian treaty was signed on the 2nd instant, and\r\nI must say that the Chinese come uncommonly well out of the affair.\r\nThey had already concluded a treaty with Mesopotamia at Shanghai,\r\nand had received no notification that the King of that country had\r\nrefused to ratify it, when all of a sudden a gentleman appeared this\r\nsummer announcing himself as plenipotentiary sent by the King to\r\nconclude a treaty, nothing being said of the former one. The Chinese,\r\nafter some discussion, named two plenipotentiaries, and offered M.\r\nT—— his choice of any existing treaty. He, however, said, “A quoi bon\r\nenvoyer un négociateur s’il ne doit pas négocier,” and sat down to\r\ncompose a treaty on the principle of an amateur opera, out of four\r\nothers. However, as the history of the treaty would not amuse you,\r\nit is enough to say that the Mesopotamian showed himself to be _plus\r\nChinois que les Chinois_, while the Chinese exhibited a pliability and\r\na willingness to accept innovations which took us all by surprise. The\r\ntreaty is an affair of very small consideration; there has occasionally\r\nbeen a Mesopotamian ship seen in the Chinese seas, and there is one\r\nMesopotamian subject in China who was declared bankrupt during the\r\nnegotiations. But the conduct of the Chinese, as showing a desire to\r\namend in their foreign policy, is of the last importance to us. They\r\nhave shown in these negotiations that they have read their translation\r\nof Wheaton’s _International Law_ with profit, and they have departed\r\nfrom old precedents in a way which was enough to make the old\r\nconservatives’ tails stand on end.\r\n\r\nThe great difficulty with the Chinese has been their foreign policy.\r\nTheir internal affairs would right themselves if they would accept our\r\ncivilisation and our standard of official probity. But if they are to\r\npreserve their independence they must learn to keep faith with foreign\r\nnations and meet honesty with honesty.\r\n\r\nAlthough in our recent dealings with the Chinese they have shown\r\nbetter faith and more loyalty than before, we have still many crows to\r\npick with them. Breaches of treaty are endless. One of the articles\r\nupon which we insist the most is that which provides that a British\r\nsubject offending against the Chinese law shall be handed over for\r\npunishment to the nearest consul. The Taeping rebellion has attracted\r\nto its ranks a vast number of rowdies, many of them deserters from the\r\nImperialist army. If these men were caught and left to the mercy of the\r\nnative authorities, it is fearful to think what their fate would be.\r\nWe are at this moment trying to rescue one man from their clutches,\r\nand investigating the case of another whom they reported to have died\r\na natural death while being taken to Shanghai; but as the report was\r\nnot made until six weeks after his death, we suspect treachery. The\r\ncentral Government shows every disposition to help us, but governors of\r\nprovinces are strong, and they know it. No stone, of course, will be\r\nleft unturned to get back the living man (if indeed he be still alive),\r\nnor to exact retribution for the death of the other, if there should be\r\nproved to have been foul play. It is not yet all rose-colour, you see.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                    _13th November._\r\n\r\nWe have no news yet of the mail of 10th September, which brings out\r\nour new chief, Sir Rutherford Alcock. I was to have gone to Tientsing\r\nto meet him, but I fancied the river journey would be rather cold;\r\nand I am very glad I did not go, as I should have been dangling about\r\nTientsing all these days, not knowing what to do with myself. In the\r\nmeanwhile we are busy preparing for his reception. I am already in my\r\nnew house, which is rather pretty, with a great deal of Chinese carved\r\nwoodwork, but eminently adapted for catching rheumatism. It will cost\r\nme something to make it wind-tight. I hope, however, by degrees to make\r\nit comfortable and cosy.\r\n\r\nI am in a state of philological orphanage. My first teacher, Ku, left\r\nme to go into some small office—office, however small, being dear to\r\nevery Chinaman; my second, a most charming person, was caught stealing\r\na dollar off my table. The man was really such a pleasant companion\r\nand such a good master that I rather wished to ignore the whole\r\nthing; but my servant Chang-Hsi represented that if Hsü Hsien Shêng\r\nremained he could be responsible for nothing that was lost, and so I\r\nhad to pack off poor Hsü. He was a perfectly inexhaustible fund of\r\nanecdotes, proverbs, folk-lore, and Chinese small talk, so different\r\nfrom the ordinary run of Chinese teachers, whose only idea of broaching\r\na conversation is to ask some preposterous question about one’s\r\n“honourable country.” If he could but have kept his hands from picking\r\nand stealing!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              LETTER XVII\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       PEKING, _25th November 1865_.\r\n\r\nWe are sending off a mail to-day in the hopes that it will yet be able\r\nto leave Tientsing for Shanghai before we are finally shut out by the\r\nfrost from communication with the outer world. After this our posts\r\nwill be rare and uncertain, going by land to Chihfu and thence on.\r\nThe winter has well set in; we have had several sharp frosts, which,\r\nalthough they are child’s play to what I have seen in Russia, are\r\naggravated by cutting winds which blow clouds of dust, pricking one’s\r\nface like flights of needles. Nothing can be more bare and desolate\r\nthan this city, now that it is stripped of its leaves. Everything looks\r\ngray and black, and the Chinese houses have a poor, pinched appearance\r\nthat to English eyes, accustomed to see a cheerful fire blazing in\r\neven the poorest cottages, is very shivery. The natives are already\r\nswaddled up in furs and wadding, and commend me to a cold Chinaman for\r\nlooking wretched. Their yellow-brown faces get perfectly livid and\r\ncorpse-like under the effect of the cold winds, a great contrast to the\r\ntanned and sturdy Mongols who are beginning to flock into the city.\r\nThe life in the streets is changed too by the innumerable droves of\r\nBactrian camels with double humps that are pouring in long streams of\r\nmerchandise.\r\n\r\nOne great advantage of this time of year is in the improvement of our\r\nlarder. In summer we are obliged to ring the changes on tough beef and\r\nstringy mutton; now we have plenty of game—hares, several sorts of\r\npheasants, wild duck, teal, snipes, and other birds innumerable. Soon\r\nwe shall have varieties of venison, amongst them that of an antelope of\r\nMongolia which the Chinese call Hwang-Yang, “yellow sheep,” said to be\r\nthe daintiest venison in the world. Of fruit we have plenty; there is a\r\ncertain small apple-shaped pear, by far the best I ever tasted. Grapes\r\nwe have every day in the year, so that nature does as much for us as\r\nMr. S——’s gardener does for him. To be sure, the gardener beats nature\r\nhollow as to quality.\r\n\r\nThe _Peking Gazette_ has just announced an appointment in the Chinese\r\nForeign Office (the Tsung-Li Yamên), which is said to be the most\r\nimportant event, as far as foreign relations are concerned, that has\r\ntaken place since the signature of Lord Elgin’s treaty. A mandarin\r\nof the name of Hsü has been named one of the high Ministers of the\r\nOffice. This man some years ago was in high office in the province\r\nof Fohkien, and while there, he, with the help of certain American\r\nmissionaries, wrote a work on the geography of the world, in which\r\nhe examined foreign institutions and men with an interest which no\r\nChinaman had ever before shown. His two favourite heroes were Napoleon\r\nand Washington. The book was written in a popular form, and had a large\r\nsale. After he had been in office three years he came to Peking to\r\npay his respects to the Emperor, and during his visit was degraded on\r\nthe plea that he had not conducted his government well, but really on\r\naccount of the new views put forward in his book, and of his admiration\r\nand intelligence of foreign affairs. Now, for the very qualities\r\nwhich before brought him into disgrace, he is raised to the dignity\r\nof a red button of the third rank, and appointed to a vacancy in the\r\nBoard of Foreign Ministers, which was made this spring by the dismissal\r\nof a mandarin named Hsüeh, who was degraded on account of his being\r\nsuspected of attempts to bribe the Prince of Kung at the same time\r\nthat His Imperial Highness was also out of favour. Hsü’s acceptance of\r\noffice is looked upon as the beginning of a new era in our intercourse\r\nwith the Chinese.\r\n\r\nSir Rutherford Alcock has reached Tientsing after a series of\r\ndisasters. He came in a man-of-war from Shanghai, disdaining the\r\nregular steamers, and the consequence is that everything has gone\r\nwrong, the last mishap being the loss of the Legation treasure outside\r\nthe bar at Taku, with 18,000 dollars. The sailors managed to upset\r\nthe chest into the sea as they were transhipping it into the little\r\nsteamer which was to bring it up the Peiho. There is a rumour that\r\ndivers have recovered the chest; if it is true, I think they deserve\r\nall its contents for their pains. The weather is not exactly suited for\r\ndiving. Meanwhile the Legation courtyards are being flooded with carts\r\nand packing-cases containing furniture, pianos, harmoniums, and games\r\nof croquet; the latter will be hard to use, for there is not a blade of\r\ngrass nearer than the park round the Temple of Heaven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              LETTER XVIII\r\n\r\n\r\n                                        PEKING, _4th December 1865_.\r\n\r\nThe messenger who brought us in the welcome mail of the 26th September\r\nalso told us that there was still a chance of catching a vessel at\r\nTaku, before the final freezing of the Gulf of Pechili—the river, of\r\ncourse, is long since closed—so here goes for the last account of us\r\nbefore we are shut up.\r\n\r\nSir Rutherford Alcock arrived here last Wednesday with his family.\r\nThey had a terrible journey of it; three days from Tientsing in sedan\r\nchairs, sleeping in inns without fires, and only paper windows in\r\ndifferent degrees of bad repair.\r\n\r\nWe are enjoying the _beau idéal_ of winter weather. We have had one\r\nfall of snow, which has left its traces in the shade and on the north\r\nside of the house-roofs; everywhere else it has disappeared under a sun\r\nwhich at mid-day is always genial; the sharp frosts of the night and\r\nearly morning keep the ground as hard as iron; the air is perfectly\r\ndelicious, and for many days we have not been visited by our chief\r\ncurse, the wind, which comes tearing down from Mongolia to choke and\r\nblind us with dust. This weather, fine as it is, comes very hard on the\r\nbeggars, who go about stark naked, livid with cold. The filth of the\r\nfurs which the poorer Chinese wear surpasses belief. It is a common\r\nsight to see the sunny side of a wall occupied by half a dozen of the\r\nnatives who have deliberately stripped themselves and are eagerly\r\nhunting after the vermin with which they swarm. The principal streets\r\nare crowded with sellers of cast-off clothes, rags that would be\r\nrejected by a respectable paper factory. They toss these about, singing\r\na sort of monotonous rhythmical chant all the time, after the manner of\r\nChinese hucksters, and they do a thriving trade in filth.\r\n\r\nWe had an offer the other day of purchasing a plant that would make a\r\nman immortal if he ate it; as we had no desire any of us to undergo\r\nthe fate of Tithonus at the price of 5000 taels, nearly £2000, we let\r\nit slip through our hands. It was brought to us by a drug merchant,\r\nwho said that he had found it in the mountains of Manchuria, and he\r\nproduced a Chinese botanical work in support of his statements. The\r\nplant was a small black toad-stool; he called it the “tree of life,”\r\nand said that it was only found once in a thousand years. We asked him\r\nwhy he did not sell his treasure to the Emperor; he replied that he\r\nwould do so were it not for the way in which he would be bled by the\r\npalace officials. When, however, we asked where the last man who had\r\neaten of the tree of life was to be heard of, he left in high disgust\r\nat our unbelief. The Chinese ideas of natural history are always very\r\ncurious. Some days ago one of the wandering curio-sellers came to me\r\nwith a beautiful little crystal snuff-bottle of what they call hair\r\ncrystal, from the black veins like hair which run through it, and he\r\nthought it necessary to explain how the hair got into the crystal. “You\r\nsee,” said he, “as your Excellency knows, we Chinese did not always\r\nshave our heads as we do now. In the time of the Ming dynasty our\r\npeople used to wear their hair long, but when the Tartars usurped the\r\nthrone our people were all forced to shave their heads. Accordingly\r\nthey threw their hair which they had cut off into the sea. There the\r\nwaves and the rays of the sun, combining their influences, acted upon\r\nthis hair and produced the effect which your Excellency admires. But it\r\nwas only in rare instances that the influences happened to coincide,\r\nand no man could of his own will, and by cutting off his hair, depend\r\non its being turned into hair crystal.”\r\n\r\nThe Emperor’s journey to bury his father has been made the opportunity\r\nof rescinding all the decrees disgracing the Prince of Kung last\r\nspring. They are to be blotted out from the records of the Empire, so\r\nthat future ages may know nothing about them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               LETTER XIX\r\n\r\n\r\n                                         PEKING, _1st January 1866_.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of the mail last night brought the old year to a happy\r\ntermination, but, alas! Saurin is to leave us for a German post. My\r\nbatch of letters was doubly welcome, it was so long since I had heard\r\nfrom home, and may be such an age before another mail comes up from\r\nChefoo; as for the newspapers, they bring such stale news now that they\r\nare hardly worth plodding through. We get the pith of the news by the\r\nRussian post and telegraph to Kiachta, so reading the _Times_ is like\r\nbeing gifted in a small way with the power of prophecy, and shows what\r\na very tame affair life would be if we could foresee the future. Our\r\npapers are still speculating on Lord Palmerston’s actions next session,\r\nand three weeks ago we heard the news of his death.\r\n\r\nThis morning I was awakened by a procession of all the Chinamen about\r\nthe Legation, who came to bend the knee before me and wish me joy for\r\nthe New Year. I hope all their good wishes, with mine into the bargain,\r\nmay be realised for You.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is a long time since I last wrote to you, I have little\r\nenough to say. Sir Rutherford and Lady Alcock have settled down in\r\ntheir new quarters. I think they are rather disappointed, and no\r\nwonder; but they seem determined to make the best of everything, and to\r\ntry and make every one comfortable about them. Sir Rutherford’s first\r\ninterview with the Prince of Kung passed off very well. I never saw the\r\nPrince so gracious. The Chinese Foreign Office, the Tsung-Li Yamên, is\r\nalmost as bad a place for receiving in as our old building in Downing\r\nStreet.[9] In order to be met at the great gates, which on grand\r\noccasions is _de rigueur_, we have to pass into the reception-room\r\nthrough the back kitchen, where we see all the little dainties which\r\nwe are to eat being cooked by very dirty natives. The reception-room\r\nis a sort of octagonal glass pavilion in the middle of the courtyard,\r\na wretchedly cold place. However, the Chinese are independent of cold\r\nrooms, for they don’t take off their furs (the fur of foxes’ legs is\r\nthe official dress), and they wear boots so thick that they cannot feel\r\nthe cold stones of the floor. Of course a building so exposed is as hot\r\nin summer as it is cold in winter, so in this climate of extremes a\r\nvisit to the Chinese Foreign Office is never very pleasant.\r\n\r\nI should tell you that the Tsung-Li Yamên is really a board of high\r\nofficials, all of whom hold other functions, which was created after\r\nthe treaties of 1860 for the conduct of foreign affairs. There is no\r\ntitular Foreign Minister.\r\n\r\nOne bright cold morning, about a fortnight ago, three of us witnessed\r\na Chinese execution. The place of execution is at the opening of the\r\nvegetable market in the Chinese city. The market is held in a broadish\r\nstreet, into which a number of large thoroughfares, at right angles\r\nto it, lead. All these inlets were fenced off, and the street itself\r\nfilled with soldiery and officials; such a tatterdemalion crowd! with\r\nnothing resembling uniformity of dress except the Tartar cap, and\r\nthat, in many cases, was torn and battered, and tassel-less. The men\r\nwere as heterogeneous as their clothes. Old and young, strong and\r\ndecrepit, half blind or whole deaf, none seemed too miserable objects\r\nfor service. I saw one effective soldier on crutches; hunchbacks and\r\ncripples were in plenty. We left our horses in charge of some of these\r\npoor devils, and walked through the lines, no one opposing us, but,\r\non the contrary, every one showing us the utmost civility. The whole\r\nof the shops in the street were closed, but the flat, low roofs were\r\ncrowded with spectators; among them not a single woman or child was to\r\nbe seen.\r\n\r\nAt one end of the space closed off was a matting shed. Inside this\r\nwere the condemned prisoners, who were waiting for the Imperial decree\r\nfor their death to be brought on to the ground. We went in, and I\r\nshall not easily forget the scene. There were fifteen criminals, of\r\nwhom one was a woman, one was a murderer; two, of whom the woman was\r\none, had stolen girls and sold them into the worst of all slavery;\r\nthe rest were highway robbers. The murderer was to be decapitated, it\r\nbeing a severe punishment to a Chinese not to take his body out of the\r\nworld as his parents gave it to him. (It is this feeling that makes\r\nthem so averse to amputation.) The others were all to be strangled.\r\nIt is very strange to be talking with men who are to die within a few\r\nminutes. Some of them were perfectly calm and collected, and came up\r\nto talk with us and ask us questions, as if nothing was the matter.\r\nOne bright, intelligent-looking fellow came up to me and said, “Well,\r\nI suppose you’ve come to see the fun.” The word he used was the same\r\nthat would be employed to signify the fun of a fair. “Do you have\r\nthis sort of fun in your country?” another said laughingly. “I wish\r\nyou would take me off with you.” We said we should only be too glad;\r\non which he smiled and said, “Ah! the law won’t let you do that.”\r\nOne very old man could not forget his Asiatic politeness, even _in\r\narticulo mortis_. One of our party had asked a guard for a light for\r\nhis cigar. The guard either did not hear or did not pay attention; on\r\nwhich the old fellow touched him and said, “What manners are these?\r\ndon’t you see the gentleman wants a light.” All, however, were not\r\nso quiet. The murderer was raving and ranting drunk, howling out\r\nevery obscene blasphemy that he could think of against the Emperor.\r\nThe woman had been charitably given some drug, which, though it had\r\nmade her very sick, had deprived her of consciousness. Nothing could\r\nexceed the kindness of the officials, one and all, to the condemned\r\nmen. They were giving them smokes out of their pipes, tea, and wine;\r\neven the wretched murderer, who was struggling and fighting between\r\ntwo soldiers, was only asked to “be quiet, be quiet,” in spite of all\r\nprovocation. The others were walking about the booth, their hands tied,\r\nand a sort of arrow stuck behind their backs, bearing their name and\r\nthe crime for which they were to suffer, but otherwise uncontrolled.\r\nThey were all from one part of the country. I told you that the woman\r\nhad been drugged. This is a constant practice at executions. The most\r\nfamous drug for this purpose is the blood from under the red crest of\r\nthe crane, called by the Chinese “Ho ting hung.” This, or a medicine\r\npurporting to be such, is sold at an immense price, and is said to be\r\ncarried by mandarins in one of the beads of their necklaces, in order\r\nthat if they incur the Emperor’s displeasure, they may have the means\r\nof death at hand, for the crane’s crest-blood is a poison as well as\r\nan anodyne. We gave all the cigars we had with us to the poor condemned\r\ncriminals, who were very grateful for them, and I was glad to leave so\r\npainful a scene. A little farther down the street another large booth\r\nhad been erected. Here sat the high officials in a semicircle, with a\r\nred-button mandarin from the Board of Punishments at their head. On one\r\nside of this booth was a tiny sort of altar on which were displayed\r\nthe tools of the executioner—the swords and bloody string, and the\r\ntourniquets and strings for strangling. In front of the altar a small\r\nbrick stove had been built, over which was a caldron of boiling water,\r\nlike a huge barber’s pot, to warm the swords. The executioner’s men\r\nwere huddled round it toasting their hands. The swords are short broad\r\nblades, almost like choppers, with a long wooden handle on which is\r\ncarved a grotesque head. They have been above two hundred years in\r\nuse, and are regarded as genii and invested with preternatural powers.\r\nThey are five in number, and their names are Great Lord, second Lord,\r\nthird Lord, fourth Lord, and fifth Lord (Ta yeh, êrh yeh, san yeh, ssŭ\r\nyeh, and wu yeh). When they are not in use they are kept at the chief\r\nexecutioner’s house, a tower on the wall, where, as my teacher gravely\r\ninformed me, they are often heard at night to sing gruesome songs of\r\ntheir past feats. When they are wanted their Lordships are “requested”\r\nto come out.\r\n\r\nThe executioners have all sorts of stories and traditions about them.\r\nOne is supposed to be younger than the others, and of a skittish,\r\nfrolicsome nature, dallying and toying with the heads, not striking\r\nthem off at one blow like the others, who are older and more sedate.\r\nThere were many false alarms that the decree had come and announced the\r\nfatal moment. But at last the chief headsman (Kwei-tzŭ-shou) came out,\r\nand throwing off his fur coat put on a bloodstained apron of yellow\r\nleather. He was a short, thick-set, but not ill-looking man, with that\r\ncurious, anxious, _waiting_ expression on his face that a man wears\r\nwith serious work before him. It was horrid to see how completely he\r\nwas the hero of the occasion, the soldiers round him treating him with\r\nthe greatest deference, and evidently proud of a word from him. The\r\nfive swords were carried in line near him. His assistant stripped his\r\nouter coat, and then all was ready. So soon as the decree arrived the\r\nprisoners were led out one by one to the booth where the mandarins\r\nwere sitting, and there made to go through the form of acknowledging\r\nthe justice of their punishment. They were then handed over to the\r\nexecutioner. The headsman and his men had to beat back the other\r\nsoldiers with sticks in order to clear a space. Nothing could be more\r\nindecent and revolting than the behaviour of the latter. All order and\r\ndiscipline were at an end; they were like hounds yelling, snarling, and\r\nstruggling to tear a fox in pieces rather than men ostensibly employed\r\nto keep the peace. The murderer was the first man brought forward.\r\nHappily he had raved himself into a state of insensibility, so his\r\npains were over. The decapitation is done with marvellous speed. A\r\nstring is passed round the prisoner’s neck, close under the chin, and\r\nhis head is thus held up by the assistant so as to offer resistance\r\nto the sword. When a mandarin is executed, the headsman meets him and\r\nsays, “Ching ta jên kwei ti̔en,” “I pray that your Excellency may fly\r\nto heaven”—much as our executioners used to ask the pardon of their\r\nvictims. The man is made to kneel, in an instant the sword is raised,\r\nthe executioner gives a shriek supposed to represent the words “I have\r\nexecuted a man” (Sha liao jên), and at one blow the head is severed\r\nfrom the trunk and carried off to be inspected by the mandarins. As\r\nthe blow falls the people all cry out, “A good sword” (hao Tao),\r\npartly in praise of the headsman’s skill, but more especially from a\r\nsuperstitious feeling _um berufen_. The strangling is done with the\r\nsame merciful quickness. It is far less lengthy than hanging. Two\r\npieces of whip-cord are passed round the neck with a loop. The criminal\r\nis placed with his face to the ground, and the two executioners turn\r\nthe tourniquet as quick as thought. Apparently there is no suffering.\r\nAs I passed the big booth on my way out—for you may imagine that when\r\nI had seen how the matter was conducted I stayed for no more—I heard\r\na loud voice shout out a name. Immediately out of the shed where the\r\nrest of the condemned were waiting, I saw a tall man walk out between\r\ntwo others as leisurely and composedly as if he had been going to his\r\ndinner. It was one of the young fellows with whom I had spoken so short\r\na time before. The last act of this horror is consummated in the _Pit\r\nof the 10,000_ (Wan Jên K’êng) by the wolves and foxes, a pit in the\r\nChinese city where the bodies of executed criminals are thrown. Rich\r\npeople’s bodies are bought back by their families that they may receive\r\ndecent burial.\r\n\r\nI was glad to see that the execution was conducted far more mercifully\r\nthan one is led to suppose by certain writers. It is true that this is\r\nnot the “Ling Chih,” or disgraceful slow death, which is the punishment\r\nof parricide[10] and high treason. But an Englishman who has witnessed\r\nthat assures me that the criminal he saw so executed was put out of his\r\nmisery at once, and that the mutilation took place _after_ death and\r\nnot before. I was specially struck by the excessive kindness of the\r\nsoldiery to the criminals. The only sign of cruel disposition was the\r\neagerness with which they pressed forward to see the death. That was\r\nrevolting.\r\n\r\nOf all the men who died that day not one appeared to be in the\r\nslightest degree affected by the solemnity of his position, or to show\r\nany apprehension for what was to follow. Where there was any emotion it\r\nwas simply abject terror of the immediate pain of dying. Beyond that\r\ntheir thoughts did not seem to penetrate.\r\n\r\nI must bring this letter of horrors to an end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               LETTER XX\r\n\r\n\r\n                                        PEKING, _20th January 1866_.\r\n\r\nSince I last wrote we have all been leading the lives of vegetables\r\nin our own garden; with a skating rink inside the Legation there is\r\nno excuse for facing the wind and dust outside. We have the greatest\r\ndifficulty in keeping up our rink. The wind blows the dust on to\r\nthe ice in clouds, and the hot sun melts it in, so that nothing but\r\nconstant flooding will keep the ice going. This has been an unusually\r\ndry season even for this driest of climates, so much so that a few days\r\nago a decree appeared in the _Peking Gazette_ directing five princes\r\nof the blood to proceed to different temples, and offer up incense,\r\nand pray for snow. The Emperor had a cold, or he would have gone\r\nhimself. The _Peking Gazette_, by the way, is a very curious little\r\npublication. It appears daily in the form of a small pamphlet, and\r\nis sold for a trifling sum. It is said to have been first published\r\nin the time of the Sung dynasty, about seven hundred years before its\r\nbrother of London was born at Oxford. It contains the movements of the\r\ncourt, Imperial decrees, petitions, memorials and the answers thereto,\r\nappointments, promotions, rewards, etc. Some of the announcements are\r\nvery amusing. I give you one or two specimens. Some months ago, at the\r\nstorming of a town which was in the hands of the rebels, at the very\r\nmoment when a mine had been sprung, Kwan-Ti, the god of war, appeared\r\nin all his majesty (it don’t seem quite clear who saw him), and by his\r\npresence so encouraged the Imperialist troops that they rushed into the\r\nbreach with an ardour which carried everything before it, and sacked\r\nthe city. In gratitude for this, at the request of the high officials\r\nof Shan Hsi, the Emperor directs the officers of the Han Lin (Imperial\r\ncollege) and of the Nan Shu Fang (private Imperial library) to prepare\r\na tablet to be erected in some temple in Shan Hsi to commemorate the\r\ndivine interposition. Notice is sent by the authorities of Cheh Kiang\r\nto the Board of Ceremonies and Rites that a widow in those parts,\r\nbeing in uncontrollable grief for her husband’s death, and resolved\r\nto preserve her fidelity to him, has committed suicide. Posthumous\r\nhonours are awarded to her for her great chastity. (To commit suicide\r\non the death of her husband is the highest virtue which a Chinese wife\r\ncan show. The streets of Peking are in many places crossed by wooden\r\ntriumphal arches called Pai Lo in honour of these chaste matrons. It\r\nwould seem, however, rather as if this extreme chastity were dying\r\nout, for I don’t know one of these arches that is not in the last\r\nstage of decay.) A taotai, governor of a city from down south, has\r\ncome up to Peking on business connected with the sulphur trade. Having\r\nfinished what he had to do, he reminds the Government that his father\r\nwas killed some years ago in the rebellion in Shan Hsi, and his body\r\nnever recovered. He represents that the old gentleman’s bones weigh\r\nheavily upon him and make him feel very uncomfortable, and he suggests\r\nthat the Government might send him on a special mission to Shan Hsi to\r\ntry and recover these same bones, paying his expenses as a matter of\r\ncourse. The Government, in reply to this, praise his filial piety,\r\nenter into his views about the bones with enthusiasm, encourage him by\r\nall means to try and find them, but positively decline to open their\r\npurse-strings. Posthumous honours, canonisation, or deification, are\r\noften recorded in the _Gazette_.\r\n\r\nOld Hêng-Chi is the officer of the Tsung-Li Yamên charged with\r\nnegotiating a new commercial treaty with the Russians relative to the\r\nSiberian and Mongolian trade. Whenever he is going to be particularly\r\nobstructive he sends po-po (sweetmeats) to the Legation. Now I suppose\r\nhe is going to play the Russians some _tour pendable_, for he sent a\r\nwhole feast both to the minister and secretary of Legation. It was\r\nvery prettily arranged; the decoration of the dishes and piling of the\r\nsweetmeats in patterns must have cost the cook a world of trouble. I\r\nthink I once before gave you an account of a Chinese feast given by the\r\nsame old gentleman, and I daresay you don’t wish a repetition of the\r\naccount any more than I do of the feast, though the things are not bad\r\nonce in a way. The bird’s-nest soup was very good, though it owes its\r\nflavour to the condiments with which it is dressed, the nest itself\r\nbeing as tasteless as isinglass, which it much resembles.\r\n\r\nMy teacher the other day gave me some original views as to the\r\noutbreak of cholera which took place a few years ago. Various causes\r\nwere assigned for it. Some said that the epidemic was caused by the\r\nexhalations from the dead bodies of those who were killed in the Ta̔i\r\nPi̔ng rebellion; others, that offence had been given to Wên Shên, the\r\nspirit of pestilence, a deity who is represented with a blue face and\r\nred hair and beard. He carries in his hand a disk, a spear, a sword,\r\nor some warlike weapon. A man who has fallen into misfortune is said\r\nto have met Wên Shên. To be “as ugly as the Lord Wên Shên” is what we\r\nshould translate by “to be as ugly as sin.”\r\n\r\nWe had rather a good piece of fun the other night. One of our ladies\r\nof the _Corps diplomatique_ has started Thursday “at homes,” and all\r\nthe Europeans in Peking congregate there. Last Thursday some one or\r\nother sat down and played a valse, upon which a tarantula bit the only\r\ntwo ladies, and they declared they must and would dance, so Pichon,\r\nthe French attaché, and I were told off as partners for them. Just\r\nas we were spinning round the room, in came three or four Chinese\r\nservants with trays of cake and hot wine, which I thought they would\r\nhave dropped, so stupefied were they at the sight. I don’t think I ever\r\nsaw astonishment so written on faces before. I can fancy them talking\r\nabout it afterwards—Ai yah! There was his Excellency Mi (that’s me) and\r\nPi Lao Yeh seizing the two Ku-niangs (young ladies) round the waist in\r\nthe most indecorous manner, and running round and round the room with\r\nthem, while O Lao Yeh beat the harp-table. Indeed it was unsurpassable!\r\nStrange people these barbarians!\r\n\r\nSaurin and I had a visit from Mr. Thomas the day before yesterday.\r\nHe is famous in China as the converse of St. Matthew, having left\r\nthe Church to go to the Customs. Mr. Thomas is a linguist of some\r\npretensions. He speaks several European languages (including Russian),\r\nChinese, Japanese, and Mongol. He came out about two years ago as a\r\nmember of one of the Missionary Societies, but quarrelled with his\r\nbrother missionaries because he had the good sense to refuse to preach\r\nin Chinese after being three months in the country. He then entered\r\nthe Chinese Customs service, and was stationed at Chihfu when I passed\r\nby there in May last. However, he has now returned to the flock, and\r\nis living with the other missionaries at Peking. Mr. Thomas has just\r\nreturned from a trip to Corea, which he undertook for purposes of\r\nlinguistic research, and we were greatly in hopes of hearing something\r\nabout that _terra incognita_. While Mr. Thomas was at Chihfu he was\r\nable to be civil to two Corean merchants who had gone there to collect\r\ndebts. They were Christians, and brought open letters with them from\r\nthe Roman Catholic mission at Saoul, the capital of Corea, entreating\r\nany Christians whom they might fall in with to treat them kindly. Mr.\r\nThomas took them to live with him, and commenced studying Corean under\r\ntheir auspices. When they were about to return to their own country\r\nMr. Thomas accompanied them. He appears, however, to have seen little\r\nor nothing. His landings were but for short walks, principally on\r\nislands along the coast. He reached a point of the coast 25 miles from\r\nSaoul, to which he intended to have gone in the disguise of a Corean\r\nin mourning for his father and mother, the face completely covered by\r\na long veil, loose white clothes hiding the body, the costume being\r\ncompleted by a hat with a brim about a yard and a half in diameter. The\r\nwreck of his Corean junk prevented his effecting his purpose (possibly\r\nluckily for him), and he was obliged to return to China in a Chinese\r\njunk; so he underwent incredible hardships from hunger and dirt, and\r\ngreat danger from shipwreck, to little purpose; what he acquired of\r\nthe language must have been through his two friends, and he can give\r\nno account of the people, who must be a curious race. Not only are\r\nthey so exclusive that they forbid foreigners to enter their country,\r\nbut they prevent their own people from leaving it, as the Japanese\r\ndid; only certain privileged persons are allowed to come to China with\r\ntribute to the Emperor or for trading purposes. There are plenty of\r\nthese in Peking at the present moment; they are distinguished by their\r\nhigh hats and peculiar type; any Corean not belonging to this guild\r\nwho left his country would be decapitated on his return. It is strange\r\nthat, notwithstanding this rigid exclusiveness, the Roman Catholic\r\nmissionaries seem to live undisturbed at Saoul, where they are said to\r\nhave made many converts. They are obliged, however, to wear the Corean\r\nmourning so as to hide their faces, and conform to the habits of the\r\ncountry.[11]\r\n\r\nThe most important part of Mr. Thomas’ tale is a report that 250\r\nCoreans have gone over the Amoor, and tendered allegiance to the\r\nRussians. Of course Russia will have Corea sooner or later, but I think\r\nthat if this report were true we must have heard of it from other\r\nsources.[12]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               LETTER XXI\r\n\r\n\r\n                                        PEKING, _3rd February 1866_.\r\n\r\nThe mail day has come round again very quickly, so I am in hopes that\r\nyou are getting letters more regularly than I had led you to expect.\r\nIf the wonderfully warm weather we are enjoying now lasts, the river\r\nmust break up soon, and then we shall have regular mails again. On the\r\n30th of January the thermometer stood at 40° Fahrenheit at midnight.\r\nThe Chinese are in great glee; after having consumed infinite amounts\r\nof joss-stick in praying for snow, and sent out princes of the blood\r\nto shiver in distant temples, and all in vain, the Emperor went out\r\none morning to pray on his own account, and on that very morning the\r\nsnow came. We took advantage of what has turned out to be the last\r\nof the frost, for the present at least, to make an expedition to\r\nYuen-Ming-Yuen and skate on the lake. It was such a bright, pretty\r\nscene—the lake was as clear as a sheet of glass, and the ice perfectly\r\ntransparent—not very good for skating, though, for the lotus plants do\r\nnot quite lie down. However, every now and then we came upon a hundred\r\nyards square of marvellous ice, uncut by skates and free from dust.\r\nA number of Chinese came to look at us; figure-skating astonished\r\nthem immensely, especially anything done going backwards. Some of\r\nthe natives skate after a fashion, but they are generally contented\r\nwith tying a skate on to one foot and pushing themselves along with\r\nthe other. It is said that skating used to form part of the Manchu\r\nbannermen’s drill. We picnicked in one of the little pavilions in the\r\ngarden, and very jolly we were.\r\n\r\nI went a few days ago, for the first time, to visit the Russian\r\nmissionary establishment (the head of which is the Archimandrite\r\nPalladius), in the north-east corner of the Tartar city. It is\r\nsurrounded by a large open space; the air is fresh; there is no dust,\r\nand above all there is immediate egress into the country without having\r\nto cross miles of filthy streets. It is such a pity that the Legations\r\nwere not established up there in 1861. The mission consists of three\r\npriests besides the chief; there is a day-school for twenty-four\r\nchildren, whose parents are all Christians; indeed, the Archimandrite\r\ntold me that the neighbouring population were almost all converts.\r\nThe Russians have altogether a large congregation here, an important\r\nelement in which are the Albazines. The Albazines were originally a\r\nsmall colony of Russian labourers, who settled at the little town of\r\nAlbazin on the Amoor. In the time of Alexis, father of Peter the Great,\r\nthe Chinese made war upon this little colony, and after a desperate\r\nresistance on their part, which lasted about two years, conquered\r\nthem and took prisoners those whom they did not kill. On account of\r\nthe great bravery which they had shown, the survivors were carried\r\nto Peking and made to serve as soldiers. Here they have lived to the\r\npresent time, having become Chinese in everything save in the matter of\r\ntheir religion, which they have faithfully preserved. From father to\r\nson they have been forced to serve as soldiers, and allowed to select\r\nno other career. It is only recently that a decree has been issued\r\nemancipating them from this rule, and permitting them to follow trade,\r\nlabour, or letters. There are probably not more than ten or fifteen\r\npure Albazine families left; but as they have intermarried freely\r\nwith the Chinese and Christianised their women, they largely swell\r\nthe Greek congregation. The carrying off of people on both frontiers\r\nhas been an old standing quarrel between China and Russia. It was to\r\nsettle questions of this sort that Peter the Great sent an embassy\r\nto the Emperor Ka̔ng-Hsi. This embassy was the foundation of the two\r\nRussian missions, that of the south being the present Legation, and\r\nthat of the north the Church mission. The southern mission was used\r\nby the merchants of the caravans which used to arrive from Siberia\r\nonce in three years, to transact business between the two countries;\r\nit has been recently rebuilt, all except the chapel, which dates from\r\nPeter’s time, and which still bears the marks of an earthquake which\r\noccurred in the middle of the last century. The Archimandrite told me\r\nthat when he first came to Peking twenty-five years ago there was no\r\nmore difficulty in holding intercourse with the people than there is\r\nat present. The priests of the mission could not go beyond the Great\r\nWall in one direction, nor as far as Tientsing in the other; but this\r\nwas owing to the mandarins, who always were, and probably always will\r\nbe, obstructive. The people were friendly enough; those who did not\r\nknow them, seeing strangely dressed figures with fair beards and hair\r\nfor the first time, took them for Manchu Tartars; so even now it often\r\nhappens that we Europeans are taken for Mongols by the Chinese who have\r\nseen neither race.\r\n\r\nI was talking the other day to my teacher about Lord Palmerston and\r\nhis wonderful strength of body and mind. He was greatly interested,\r\nand cited two instances in Chinese history of statesmen who were\r\nflourishing and vigorous after eighty years of age. The first case he\r\nmentioned was that of the minister Liang, who, in the reign of the\r\nEmpress Wu-Tseih-Ti̔en of the Tang dynasty (seventh century A.D.),\r\nobtained the highest literary degree, and became premier at the age of\r\neighty-two. The second case he cited was more legendary.\r\n\r\nWên Wang, father of Wu Wang, the first Emperor of the Chou dynasty\r\n(and a contemporary of Saul, King of Israel), dreamt a dream, and\r\nin his dream he saw a beast that was like a boar and yet like a man,\r\nand it had wings and flew. Now when he awoke he was sorely troubled\r\nin his heart, because he could not read the meaning of his dream;\r\nso he sent for the court seer, and the court seer told him that the\r\ninterpretation of his dream was, that he should have a wise and crafty\r\ncouncillor. When Wên Wang heard this, he immediately sallied forth in\r\nhis chariot to seek for this wise man, and he took with him his two\r\nsons. After many days he came to a river called Wei-Shui-Ho, and by\r\nthe side of the river was an old man fishing. The name of this old man\r\nwas Tai Kung, and during the reign of the wicked Emperor Chou-Hsin he\r\nhad lived in a cave in a mountain, cultivating learning. When Wên Wang\r\nsaw the old man he told his sons to descend from the chariot and ask\r\nhim the road. But the old man went on with his fishing, and answered\r\nthem, saying, “Behold the little fishes have come to me, but the big\r\nfish stops away.” Now when this oracular answer was told to Wên Wang he\r\nimmediately knew that this must be the wise man that was promised to\r\nhim in his dream, for the old man’s saying was a reproach to him that\r\nhe had not himself gone down, as manners required, but sent his sons\r\ninstead. So Wên Wang invited Tai Kung to get into his chariot, and he\r\ncarried him off and made him his chief minister. At that time Tai Kung\r\nwas eighty years old and more. When Wên Wang died Wu Wang treated Tai\r\nKung with the honours due to a father, for it was by his wise counsels\r\nthat the dynasty became strengthened in the kingdom. He lived to nearly\r\na hundred years of age, and at his death he became a spirit, and many\r\nsay that he is now the captain of all the spirits, and assigns to each\r\nhis particular place and duties.\r\n\r\nThe above is a word for word translation of the story of Tai Kung as my\r\nteacher told it me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              LETTER XXII\r\n\r\n\r\n                                        PEKING, _8th February 1866_.\r\n\r\nI expect this will reach England with the bag that was despatched last\r\nSaturday; at any rate it will give you a few days later news; I have\r\nbut little to say.\r\n\r\nThe student interpreters gave a second theatrical representation on\r\nMonday. The pieces were “Our Wife” and “To Paris and back for £5.” To\r\nmy mind the most amusing part of the entertainment was to watch the\r\nfaces of the Chinese servants at the back, who, not understanding a\r\nword, were deeply interested in the performance, and said that it was\r\nvery beautiful, especially the first piece, in which the makeshifts\r\nfor Louis XIII. dresses charmed them much. The ladies stood on an\r\naverage 5 feet 10 inches in their stockings, and had blue marks where\r\nwhiskers and beards had been shaved off in the morning; but in spite\r\nof all drawbacks, everybody agreed that there never had been and never\r\ncould be such a success—which has always been said of every private\r\nperformance I ever witnessed.\r\n\r\nNo one could believe that we are ice-bound here. Yesterday the\r\nthermometer at 2 P.M. stood at 84° in our courtyard; at eight in the\r\nmorning it had been down to 22°, a difference of 62°! The Chinese\r\ncomplain bitterly of the heat. The Emperor was to go again to pray for\r\nsnow to-day, and the _Peking Gazette_ publishes an article from one of\r\nthe Imperial advisers, stating that the want of snow must be ascribed\r\nto the anger of heaven on two accounts: 1st, undue severity on the part\r\nof minor officials in the Board of Punishments; 2nd, the number of\r\nbodies killed in the rebellion and still lying unburied.\r\n\r\nWhat thieves these mandarins are! Some, time ago when the Ti̔en Wang\r\n(Prince of Heaven), the chief of the Ta̔i Pi̔ng rebellion, poisoned\r\nhimself, his son fled carrying with him his father’s great seal, which,\r\non his capture, was carried to the Emperor at Peking. The seal was a\r\nhuge affair of massive gold with two dragons on the top. Its value\r\nwas about £600. When the Emperor had seen it, it was handed over to\r\nthe Prince of Kung and the Grand Council, and by them deposited under\r\nlock and key in the council office, the watching of which by night\r\nis confided to certain high officials. When the turn of night duty\r\nfell to one Sa, a man of good family and a mandarin of the fourth\r\nbutton, the seal was missing. There was a great hue and cry, and all\r\nthe wretched servants in the office were carried off to the Board of\r\nPunishments, where they were tortured _secundum artem_, the real thief\r\nSa being quite above suspicion. Meanwhile he carried off the seal to a\r\ngoldsmith’s shop in the Chinese city, telling him that he had received\r\norders from the palace to have it melted down. The man undertook the\r\njob and put the seal into the melting-pot; but the two dragons, being\r\nharder than the rest of the metal, would not melt, so they were put\r\non one side to wait till a hotter fire could be prepared. As luck\r\nwould have it a friend of the goldsmith, who had heard of the loss of\r\nthe seal, came in, and seeing the two dragons, smelt a rat, and laid\r\nan information. Sa was tried, found guilty, and strangled in the\r\nvegetable market. He was a well-to-do man, and his family were rich\r\npeople, so the money was not needed. But a little peculation, however\r\nsmall, is dear to a mandarin’s heart.\r\n\r\nSa was not a master of his craft; he had not sufficiently considered\r\nthe eleventh commandment,—most important to a Chinese official.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              LETTER XXIII\r\n\r\n\r\n                                           PEKING, _7th March 1866_.\r\n\r\nMy last letter to you was dated 8th February, on which day the\r\nfestivities of the Chinese New Year began with the feast of Tsao, the\r\ngod of the hearth. This, of course, is inaugurated with popping of\r\nfireworks and banging of cannon. Tsao is of all the spirits the one\r\nmost intimately connected with the family, and every year, eight days\r\nbefore the New Year, he goes to heaven to make his report. Now as in\r\nevery family there must always be some little secrets which it is not\r\ndesirable should be known in heaven, it is essential that something\r\nshould be done to prevent Tsao’s tongue from wagging too freely, so\r\nofferings are made to him of barley-sugar, that his mouth may be\r\nsticky! At the same time, upon either side of his niche, which stands\r\nin the kitchen, are pasted posters of red paper, the one bearing the\r\nwords “Go to heaven and make a good report,” the other “Come back to\r\nyour palace and bring good luck.” The niche is then burnt, and the god\r\nrises to heaven to come back on New Year’s Day, against which time a\r\nnew niche is prepared for him.\r\n\r\nAs the New Year approaches, the principal amusement in the streets\r\nis flying kites. These are admirably made, and represent all manner\r\nof birds, beasts, and fishes. There are some which even represent\r\ncentipedes, but I have not seen those. In the tail of the kite is\r\nplaced a sort of Æolian harp, such as I once told you the Chinese\r\nattach to their pigeons. I cannot tell you what a strange effect these\r\nweird-looking monsters humming high up in the air present. The Street\r\nof Lanterns, too, begins to make a great show. Lamps of every variety\r\nof shape, from a bouquet of flowers to a fiery dragon, are exposed for\r\nsale and bought in quantities.\r\n\r\nOn New Year’s Eve the houses are cleaned up and put in order.\r\nCharacters of good omen are pasted on all the door-posts; from the\r\nwindow-sills little strips of red paper stamped like lace flutter\r\nin the wind. An altar is erected in the courtyard with candles and\r\nofferings, while crackers and fireworks are let off all night to chase\r\naway all the evil Spirits that have been about during the year, and\r\nespecially the Spirit of Poverty.\r\n\r\nThe 15th of February was the Chinese New Year’s Day. It was a bright,\r\nfine day, and the people were all figged out in the best raiment\r\navailable, either from their own wardrobes or those of the pawnbrokers,\r\nwhose chests must have been emptied of every article of smart clothing\r\nfor the occasion. All the shops were shut, but not empty; for from many\r\nof them there issued the most infernal clatter that ever stunned human\r\nears. I looked into one, my curiosity getting the better of my manners,\r\nand there I saw a number of respectable middle-aged _bourgeois_ sitting\r\nin a circle, and each with a clapper, gong, cymbals, or drum, beating\r\nfor dear life with the gravest of faces. This was exorcising devils,\r\nand, if devils have ears, ought to be a successful plan. The streets\r\nare full of people paying complimentary visits to their friends, a\r\nceremony which is nowhere so universally observed as in China. Outside\r\nthe Chien Mên, one of the gates leading from the Tartar into the\r\nChinese city, is a small yellow-tiled Imperial temple to Kwan-Ti, the\r\ngod of war. This is crowded with worshippers on New Year’s Day. High\r\nand low flock to pay their respects and draw their lot for the year.\r\nOutside the temple were a couple of priests doing a brisk trade in\r\ntracts and joss-sticks. Armed with a bundle of the latter, which are\r\nwhisked about in flames, to the great peril of European beards, the\r\ndevout advance and perform the ko̔to̔u before the altar with three\r\nkneelings and nine knockings of the head. They then draw nearer to\r\nthe altar, and from a sort of cup which stands upon it draw at random\r\na slip of bamboo with certain characters upon it. This is exchanged\r\naccording to its inscription for a piece of paper which is handed to\r\nthe votary for a few cash by an attendant priest, and which contains\r\nhis fortune for the year. The people who took part in this ceremony\r\nwere excessively devout in their demeanour; there was no symptom\r\nof levity or indifference; they were imploring the protection of a\r\ndivine being for the coming year, with superstition if not with piety.\r\nThe richer worshippers were making offerings of pigs and sheep as\r\nsacrifice.\r\n\r\nI don’t recollect whether I ever mentioned to you the Liu Li Chang,\r\na street of booksellers and curiosity shops, and one of my favourite\r\nlounges here. It is one of the lions of the New Year. A very amusing\r\nfair is held there. It is perfectly thronged with people, and a very\r\ngay scene. Toys and artificial flowers are the best things sold; some\r\nof the former are capital. Lifelike models of insects, tiny beasts and\r\nbirds, tops, kites of all shapes, and above all some little figures\r\nof European soldiers and sailors—caricatures of the late war—that\r\nwere irresistibly comic. One man was selling a capital toy—two little\r\nfigures, jointed, and so contrived that by pulling a horsehair which is\r\nnot seen they begin to fight and go through every motion of desperate\r\nwrestling. There were some jugglers, but rather a low lot. One man was\r\nhaving bricks smashed on his head—a somewhat alarming performance,\r\nfor which, however, he seemed none the worse. Then there was a combat\r\nbetween sword and spear, after the manner of Savile House in old days,\r\nwhich ended in sword getting a kick in the stomach and a poke in the\r\nribs, which well earned a sixpence. A peep-show represented views\r\ntaken in China and Europe, of which the exhibitor was as ignorant as\r\nhis audience: he described St. Paul’s Cathedral and the Bay of Naples\r\nas places of repute in the Lew Chew Islands; and I really should be\r\nashamed to tell you what was painted on the reverse of the view of\r\nSt. Paul’s. A temple of the Chinese Æsculapius in one corner of the\r\nfair was crowded with visitors, who were pressing round the stall of\r\na venerable gentleman whose stock-in-trade was a bushel or two of\r\nteeth and a picture representing the treatment of every variety of\r\ndisease in diagrams. The teeth he had extracted were mostly sound!\r\nFortune-tellers were casting up chances, and wise men reading destinies\r\nin all the courts, which were piled high with votive tablets from\r\ngrateful patients. As to the walls, the tablets on them were three\r\ndeep. The crowd were uniformly civil to us, but oh, the garlic of them!\r\nIt was high jinks for the beggars, who were more than usually offensive\r\nand pertinacious, especially the women with sick babies, who would\r\ninsist on wishing one a Happy New Year in every key. It’s no use being\r\npitiful, for if you give to one you will have a tail of a hundred at\r\nyour heels.\r\n\r\nThe New Year’s festivities last for a fortnight or so; it is an endless\r\nsuccession of feasting and fireworks until the Feast of Lanterns,\r\ntwelve days after New Year’s Day. The latter is quite a bright scene\r\nwith all the lanterns and transparencies, but it sounds much more than\r\nit is.\r\n\r\nI must tell you something about the Chinese travellers who are\r\ngoing to Europe, and whom you will see or hear about. Mr. Hart, the\r\nInspector-General of Customs, is going home on leave, and the Chinese\r\nGovernment have ordered his Chinese secretary, with his son and three\r\nyoung Chinamen, students of European languages, to accompany him. Pin\r\nChun, the gentleman in question, has been raised to the Clear Blue\r\nButton, third grade, and made an honorary chief clerk in the Foreign\r\nOffice on the occasion. His son has been made a clerk in the Foreign\r\nOffice. It is a great pity that the Chinese did not choose a more\r\nintelligent and younger man than Pin Chun, who is sixty-four years old,\r\nand a shocking twaddle. He and his son are, from what I have seen and\r\nheard of them, quite incapable of forming just appreciations of what\r\nthey will see. Then, for their first mission to Europe, although it\r\nhas no official character, they should have chosen a mandarin of more\r\nimportance than Pin, whose reports will have but little weight with the\r\nlettered class of Chinese; indeed, these are jealous of his promotion,\r\nand consider that his distinction is too cheaply earned. The reason of\r\nPin’s having been chosen is that he is a connection by marriage with\r\none of the ministers of the Chinese Foreign Office. He is said to be\r\nvery popular in Pekingese society, so at any rate, when he comes back,\r\nwhat he has seen will be talked about in the “highest circles”; and\r\nhe is personally acquainted with the Prince of Kung, who proposed the\r\nmission to him at a wedding breakfast. Pin has no official character\r\nas envoy. He is told to travel and write down all about the “hills\r\nand streams” of the countries he visits, and he will be trotted about\r\nto every object of interest. I only hope that he will not be too much\r\nlionised. It would be misinterpreted here, where people would say at\r\nonce, “See what great people we are; when a private traveller among us\r\ngoes to your country he is received with the respect which you know is\r\ndue to a superior intelligence, but your barbarian ministers even are\r\nnot received here,—of course our Emperor is great and powerful, and you\r\nare only here on sufferance.”\r\n\r\nI must leave off. I am just starting to Tientsing to see Saurin off,\r\nalas! and when I come back it will be to almost entire solitude.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I have spoken rather too slightingly of Pin Chun’s mission. It\r\nis a small thing in itself, but we all look upon it as the first step\r\ntowards permanent missions in Europe and better relations here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              LETTER XXIV\r\n\r\n\r\n                                          PEKING, _12th April 1866_.\r\n\r\nI am going to tell you about an entertainment at the house of a Chinese\r\nmandarin. You will have gathered from my former letters to you that we\r\nsee nothing of the Chinese in their own houses; their life and habits\r\nare a sealed book to us. We only see the mandarins in full dress and\r\nwith the mask they wear in conference. It was a great pleasure to me,\r\ntherefore, to make the acquaintance of a Chinese gentleman of good\r\nposition, who is so far enlightened above his fellows as to like and\r\neven seek the society of Europeans, and learn what he can from them.\r\nYang Lao Yeh is a mandarin wearing a blue button of the third grade;\r\nhe is nominally on the staff of the officials of the Board of War, but\r\nhis private fortune of some ten or twelve thousand pounds a year makes\r\nhim independent of his office, except in so far as his social rank\r\nis concerned (for, as you know, in China, to hold office is to be a\r\ngentleman). I became acquainted with him through the Russian Legation,\r\nwith which he has had intercourse for some three years or more, and\r\nhe invited a party of us to his house at the time of the Feast of\r\nLanterns. He occupies a large house in the Chinese city. We went to\r\nhim at about eleven o’clock in the morning. As he had not expected us\r\nquite so early we spent half an hour in going over the premises. I\r\nhad never before seen the interior of a Chinese gentleman’s home; I\r\nimagined, however, that Yang’s would be a very favourable specimen of a\r\nrich man’s house. It is very pretty, with innumerable courtyards round\r\nwhich the dwelling-houses are built. The principal court surrounds\r\na small artificial pond, in the centre of which is a sort of glass\r\nsummer-house approached by two little miniature bridges with tiny white\r\nlions of white marble guarding them at intervals. Rockeries, which are\r\na very favourite garden ornament, caves, grottoes, and turrets with\r\nbattlements, all on a Liliputian scale, are crammed wherever there is\r\nroom, in a most picturesque defiance of order and architecture. The\r\nonly attempts at flowers and shrubs are a few of the famous dwarfed\r\ntrees, trained so as to represent with their branches characters of\r\ngood omen, such as Happiness, Longevity, etc. A broad terrace walk\r\nsurmounts the whole. But besides having the most perfect luxury _à la\r\nChinoise_, Yang is a great amateur of all European inventions. He has\r\na room fitted up after our fashion, and his whole house is full of\r\nguns, telescopes, clocks, barometers, thermometers, and other foreign\r\nimportations. He has even gone so far as to fit up a photographic\r\nstudio, and takes lessons in the art, which he practises with\r\nconsiderable success. He gave us really capital portraits of himself\r\nof his own execution. When we had wandered all over the house Yang led\r\nus into the private apartments where breakfast had been prepared for\r\nus. Here he presented to us his son, a very small boy of sixteen, but\r\na white-buttoned mandarin, nevertheless (of course the rank had been\r\npurchased; in China both civil and military rank can be bought). The\r\nladies of the family, resplendent in silks and satins of many colours,\r\nand painted so that not a particle of _themselves_ was visible, were\r\nseparated from us by a curtain through which they kept continually\r\npeeping, anxious to see, and not unwilling to be seen. We were joined\r\nby two mandarins, one from the Board of Punishments, the other from the\r\nBoard of Revenue, both very cheery and talkative. The breakfast was by\r\nfar the highest effort of Chinese culinary art that I have yet seen;\r\na certain marinade of venison, especially, was beyond praise. Being\r\nasked to eat with chop-sticks always rather reminds me of the fable of\r\nthe fox who invited the stork to dinner, and makes me appreciate the\r\nfeelings of the stork on that occasion; but Yang had provided forks, so\r\nwe were able to eat on equal terms with our entertainer, who, apropos\r\nof chopsticks, told us a story of a courtier who was so expert with\r\nthat utensil that when a grain of rice once fell from the Imperial lips\r\nhe caught it between his sticks as it fell, for which feat he was on\r\nthe spot promoted to high office and emoluments.\r\n\r\nThe only fault of the breakfast was that there was too much of it, and\r\nas we were perpetually being pledged by our host and his friends in\r\nwarm wine of the headiest nature (no heeltaps), matters were beginning\r\nto look serious, when happily the dishes were cleared away and tea\r\nwas brought. I thought the eating was all over, but not a bit of it:\r\nit was only a pause in our labours; for in came a huge and delicious\r\ntureen of bird’s-nest soup and pigeons’ eggs with cream of rice in\r\nbowls to drink—excellent, but stodgy,—and so a Chinese feast goes on\r\nall day without a halt. We witnessed an instance of the duty which a\r\nChinese son shows to his father; for not only did Yang’s son not sit\r\ndown to dinner with us, but he waited at table like a sort of upper\r\nservant, handing his father’s pipe, and anticipating all our wants.\r\nAmongst other things which he forced upon us was a bottle of Curaçoa,\r\nwhich much delighted the Chinese guests. I ought to have mentioned that\r\nbefore breakfast began, a company of acrobats made their appearance\r\nto perform in the yard. The contortionists were two women and four\r\nlittle girls. The band, which hardly stopped clashing during upwards\r\nof three hours, consisted of a gong, two pair of cymbals, and a single\r\nkettledrum, beaten by men. The performance was chiefly rope-dancing\r\nand tumbling; the tricks were not in themselves as good as what we see\r\ndaily in the streets of European cities, but the difficulty of them\r\nwas enhanced by the performers all being small-footed. The elder woman\r\nwas amazingly strong. Lying on her back she balanced tables, chairs,\r\nand other heavy objects on her feet as if they had been feathers, and\r\nwound up by taking a large wine jar into which a little girl had been\r\nput, like the forty thieves in the _Arabian Nights_, and tossing it\r\nabout on her tiny goat’s hoofs in the most alarming manner. Whenever a\r\ntrick was reaching its climax, the band, indefatigable and painfully\r\nconscientious, beat away vigorously, making the morning hideous with\r\ntheir _charivari_. To rest the women, who then took their places at\r\nthe musical instruments, the men began to show off some juggling\r\ntricks. It was a mean performance, however, the tricks being all of\r\nthe commonest and most transparent—such as the production of bowls\r\nof fishes, flower-pots, etc. The best trick was the waving of a sort\r\nof whip of paper twelve yards long and four inches wide, attached to\r\na short stick. This the performer brandished and flourished in all\r\ndirections, making the paper assume all manner of graceful shapes:\r\nnow it was a snake crawling in huge coils along the ground, now a\r\nspiral column like Donato the one-legged dancer’s scarf, now a series\r\nof hoops through which the juggler skipped backwards and forwards.\r\nThis was a very exhausting exercise. During the performances a rather\r\namusing dialogue was carried on between the old man of the party and\r\na small boy who acted the part of Mr. Merryman, steadily refusing to\r\nbelieve in the possibility of the tricks announced. The acrobats were\r\nnot paid their fee all at once, but instead of giving applause for\r\nany particularly successful exertion, Yang would send them out money,\r\nand as we, according to Chinese custom, did the same, they received a\r\nplentiful largesse. One point of contrast between rope-dancing in China\r\nand in Europe is its decency. The women all wore their heavy winter\r\ntrousers and loose jackets fastened at the waist by a sash—a costume\r\nwhich shows no outline of the form.\r\n\r\nWe stayed with Yang until three in the afternoon. I believe he had\r\nexpected us to spend the night in his house; but the entertainment was\r\nbecoming wearisome; besides, the Chinese do not understand our ideas\r\nof comfort—paper windows, thorough draughts, stone floors, and hard\r\nbenches explain why they wrap themselves up in wadding and furs, and\r\nwear boots an inch thick in the soles. They are far behind the Turks in\r\nthese respects. I, for one, thought a night in the Chinese city rather\r\ntoo much of a good thing, and was glad to make my bow. Our host, his\r\nson, and his Chinese guests, who, by the bye, had at an early hour gone\r\noff to a back room to enjoy a pipe of opium, came to the outer gate to\r\nsee us off, and we parted with many expressions of goodwill on both\r\nsides.\r\n\r\nI have had a deal of talk with Yang; he is certainly by far the most\r\nadvanced Chinaman I have met yet. Railways and telegraphs, which are\r\nthe bugbears of the Chinese ministers, are to him necessities which it\r\nis foolish to stave off; indeed, he spoke to me about constructing a\r\ntramway and telegraph over his property in Shantung for the convenience\r\nof communicating with his tenants and agents. Any new European\r\ninvention which he hears of, instead of shaking his head and saying,\r\n“Ai ya! it is very wonderful!” he sends for and tries to introduce\r\ninto the country. Indeed, more than this, if he is not called to high\r\noffice next year, he proposes visiting Europe, Russia, France, and\r\nEngland; perhaps he will go home with me.\r\n\r\nThe Peking races came off on the 4th inst. They were a great success.\r\nThe course was made at a place called Wang-ho-lou, about three miles\r\noutside the city. It is the bed of an old lake dried up; a pretty spot\r\nsurrounded by hillocks, and with the mountains in the background. Every\r\nmound was covered with thousands of Chinese who had come to gape and\r\nwonder at the barbarian sports. Two of the ministers of the Foreign\r\nOffice, Hêng and Chung, came to the grand stand. Old Chung had brought\r\nwith him his grandson, a smart little fellow of eight years old, as\r\ndignified as a judge, and far graver than his grandfather. I made the\r\nlittle fellow sit by me at breakfast, and plied him with good things,\r\nof which he expressed his approbation with the solemnity of a Burleigh.\r\nWine I could not get him to touch, not even champagne. Altogether,\r\nconsidering the means, or rather want of means, at our disposal, we\r\nmanaged to have a capital day’s sport. Our little ponies are very\r\nfast. An old pony that Saurin gave me, “Kwan-du,” won the half-mile\r\nrace, running it in one minute and five seconds, without training,\r\nand with 11 stone on his back. Between our races the two ministers\r\nmade the officers of their escort show off their ponies; one, a small\r\ngray pony of Hêng’s, was a regular little beauty, and would have been\r\nmuch admired in Rotten Row. But I think that the prettiest pony on the\r\ncourse was a little bay pony that I call “Hop-o’-my-thumb”—a little\r\nfellow that I bought some time ago to replace my cob, which, according\r\nto my usual luck, went lame in the shoulder without hope of cure. The\r\nChinese on the race day were not so civil as usual; we had much ado to\r\nkeep the course, and when we were going away they yelled, shouted, and\r\nshrieked at us like a pack of wolfish fiends. They even went so far\r\nas to throw a few stones, none of which struck any one; of course, in\r\nsuch a crowd it was impossible to identify all the offenders; however,\r\none or two got well thrashed. A little while ago I was riding with Sir\r\nRutherford and a lady to the Temple of Heaven, when at the bottom of\r\nthe main street of the Chinese city we were mobbed and attacked with\r\nstones and brickbats, one of which struck our escort. It is no use\r\ncomplaining to the authorities—we get no redress. I have begun to\r\nthink for some time past that the _bonhomie_ of the Chinese, which was\r\nso taking to me at first, is only a mask to cover hatred and disgust,\r\nhappily tempered by the most abject terror and cowardice. However that\r\nmay be, we are the masters for the present, and they know it—that is\r\nall that is required.\r\n\r\nWe are enjoying lovely spring weather now, warm and genial, with a\r\nlittle rain to remind one of home. The town is beginning to show a\r\nlittle green from the wall, on which dog-violets and vetches, very\r\nmuch dried up and sapless, are putting their noses out of the crannies\r\nbetween the bricks.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                       _13th April._\r\n\r\nMail-day. No letters from home for a month past, and we hear that the\r\nmail has broken down at Galle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               LETTER XXV\r\n\r\n\r\n                                          PEKING, _22nd April 1866_.\r\n\r\nSince I last wrote I have done nothing and seen nothing that I have not\r\ntold you about over and over again. However, to-morrow morning I am off\r\nfor a three weeks’ trip into Mongolia with Dr. Pogojeff of the Russian\r\nLegation. We shall go out of China by the Nan Ko̔u Pass, and come in\r\nby my former route of Ku-Pei-Ko̔u. I am looking forward with immense\r\ninterest to seeing a little of Mongol life for the first time. It\r\nwill be a new experience. I am afraid that one mail must pass without\r\ntaking you any news of me; but when I return I hope to make amends.\r\nWe had a great field-day at the Tsung-Li Yamên last week. Railroads,\r\ntelegraphs, violation of treaties, etc., all the old stories that have\r\nbeen trotted out a hundred times. The Prince of Kung was very nervous\r\nand fidgety. He twisted, doubled, and dodged like a hare. At last\r\nwhen Sir Rutherford had him, as he thought, fairly in a corner, I saw\r\na gleam of hope and joy come over the Prince’s face. He had caught a\r\nsight of his old friend and refuge in trouble, my eyeglass. In a moment\r\nhe had pounced upon it, and there was an end of all business. The whole\r\npack of babies were playing with it, and our Chief, who was furious,\r\nsaw his sermons scattered to the wind. It does not signify, though, for\r\nthese tricksters will promise anything. It is the performance which\r\nis lacking. By the bye, when the Prince of Kung calls at a Legation\r\nhe leaves a card in the shape of a slip of red paper with his name\r\nand title upon it—Kung Chi̔n Wang.[13] But he never signs his name to\r\ndocuments; he subscribes them, Wu ssŭ hsin—“No private heart,” _i.e._\r\n“disinterested.”\r\n\r\nA Cantonese named Ma, whom I know and who has come up to Peking on\r\nbusiness, was anxious to buy a little Pekingese slave-girl, and I was\r\npresent at the negotiations. The child, a bright little creature eight\r\nyears of age, was brought by her parents to Ma’s lodging, and as she\r\ngave satisfaction, the question resolved itself into one of price, and\r\nhere the fun began, for the little thing was so keen to go that she\r\neagerly took part with the purchaser in beating down the vendors; and,\r\nfinally, a bargain was struck at 28 dollars. At that price she was\r\nhanded over to her new owner, together with a bill of sale, of which\r\nhere is a translation:—\r\n\r\n“This is a deed of sale. Wan Chêng, of the village of Wan Ping, has\r\na child the offspring of his body, being his second daughter and his\r\nseventh child, aged eight years. Because his house is poor, cold, and\r\nhungry, relying on what has passed between a third person and his wife,\r\nhe has determined to sell his daughter to one named Ma. He sells her\r\nfor twenty-eight dollars, every dollar to be worth seven tiaos and a\r\nhalf. The money has been paid over in full under the pen” (_i.e._ at\r\nthis time of writing). “The girl is to obey her master and to depend\r\nupon him for her maintenance. In the event of any difficulties or\r\ndoubts arising on the part of the girl’s family, the seller alone is\r\nresponsible, it does not regard the buyer. It is to be apprehended that\r\ncalamities may occur to the child, but that is according as Heaven\r\nshall decree; her master is not responsible. None henceforward may\r\ncross the door to meddle in her affairs. This agreement has been made\r\nopenly face to face. In case of any inquiries being made this document\r\nis to serve as proof.” (Here follow the signatures or rather marks\r\nof the vendor, the middleman, and a third person as witness, and the\r\ndate.) “The child’s birthday is the 11th day of the 6th month, she was\r\nborn between the seventh and eighth hours.”\r\n\r\nMa declares that as soon as the girl is grown up he shall let her\r\nmarry. He says, “My no wanchee do that black heart pidgin.” I believe\r\nhe will keep his word—it is a matter of business, and in business the\r\nsouthern Chinese trader is scrupulously honest.\r\n\r\nAs for the child, she was simply in a fever of delight at leaving her\r\nparents. I dare say her poor little life had been none too rosy; for\r\nwhat says the proverb? “Better one son, though deformed, than eighteen\r\ndaughters as wise as the apostles of Buddha.”\r\n\r\nI wonder whether any European ever witnessed such a transaction before.\r\n\r\nI have been spending the last few days chiefly in Paternoster Row,\r\nthe Liu Li Chang, sitting at the feet of a very learned little Chinese\r\nGamaliel, who tells me wonderful stories about the arts and the old\r\ncraftsmen of China. He is a bookseller by trade, but being a great\r\nconnoisseur, he always has a few rare specimens of cloisonné enamel,\r\njade, rock crystal, cornelian, or porcelain in his shop. He is never\r\nweary of telling how the Emperor Ching Ta̔i (A.D. 1450) used to work\r\nat cloisonné enamel (like Louis XVI. at locks, and Peter the Great\r\nat boat-building); how some even say that he even invented the art,\r\nto which the Chinese still give his name, calling it Ching Ta̔i Lan,\r\nChing Ta̔i’s blue; how the great family of potters, the Langs, died out\r\nin the beginning of the seventeenth century, carrying their secrets\r\nwith them to the grave, and how ever since that time the Chinese have\r\nbeen trying to discover their methods—but all in vain—only producing,\r\ninstead of a wonderful _sang de bœuf_ of so soft a paste that it looks\r\nas if you might scoop it out with a spoon, the, as he calls them,\r\ninferior imitations, to which the French gave the name of Céladon\r\nJaspé, and which the great metal workers, such as Caffieri, used to\r\ndelight in mounting. Cloisonné enamel, by the bye, went out of fashion\r\nat the end of the last century, and the Chinese ceased to make it; but\r\nwhen, after the sacking of the Summer Palace, the specimens looted\r\nthere and sent home fetched such wonderful prices in London and Paris,\r\nthey routed out the drawers in which their forbears had carefully\r\nlocked their recipes—for a Chinaman never destroys anything—and soon\r\nthe market will be flooded with new work. The first specimen was\r\nbrought to me at the Legation the other day, and very good it was.\r\n\r\nThe rose-backed plates and cups dear to the keen-eyed loungers at\r\nChristie’s can never have been the fashion at Peking, where men chiefly\r\nlove the brave colours and bold designs of the artists of the Ming\r\ndynasty, and where purses are opened wide for ever so small a piece\r\nof the thickly glazed ware of the days of the Yuan and the Sung. From\r\nKa̔ng Hsi’s reign to the end of Chien Lung’s, A.D. 1796, one seems\r\nto feel the Jesuit, or European, influence in the substitution of\r\narabesques for the old barbaric designs. The great age for art in China\r\nand Japan, as in Europe, was the cinque cento; the meanest, the dawn of\r\nthe nineteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              LETTER XXVI\r\n\r\n\r\n                                            PEKING, _23rd May 1866_.\r\n\r\nI returned from my Mongolian expedition last Friday, the 18th,\r\nhalf-starved and burnt to a cinder, but very jolly. I copy my journal\r\nfor you.\r\n\r\nWe left Peking, the doctor and I, on the 23rd April. We took with\r\nus my servant Chang Hsi, groom, and fat cook. We of course rode our\r\nown horses, while five mules carried the servants and baggage. The\r\ndoctor’s dog Drujok, a half-bred Russian setter, and my Prince, a heavy\r\nshambling puppy whom I call a Newfoundland, but whose _seize quartiers_\r\nit would be difficult to prove, made up the party. Our cavalcade made\r\na great sensation in the streets of Peking. “Here’s a game,” shouted\r\nthe street—arabs, piggish in many respects besides their tails; “look\r\nat the devils and the devil dogs!” We went out at the Tê Shêng Mên\r\n(Victory Gate). So soon as we had passed the dusty streets and suburbs\r\nobstructed by carts and camels, whose bells and dull tramp irritate\r\none’s ears, while the dust they shuffle up blinds and chokes one, the\r\nride became delightful. The fresh green of the budding trees and young\r\nspring crops and the tints of the distant hills were new life to eyes\r\ntired with the monotonous grays of a Peking winter. It was a lovely day\r\ntoo, bright, sunny, and cooled by a fresh breeze from the mountains.\r\n\r\nFormer experience of carts had decided me to take mules; but it was out\r\nof the frying-pan into the fire. Carts are slow, mules are slower. If\r\none takes carts the servants are sure to stow away one ragamuffin at\r\nleast to help them with their work and add to the expense. If one takes\r\nmules the muleteer is sure to add a number of mules carrying wares for\r\ntrade at the different towns, which creates endless delays. Besides,\r\nthe pack-mules cannot keep up with the horses, and it is no joke to\r\narrive at an inn, tired and hungry, with the choice of ordering a bad\r\nChinese dinner, or waiting three hours for the cook to come up and\r\nprepare a better one. Being in advance, we always had to find our own\r\nway from place to place; easy enough if one could even get a direct\r\nanswer, but you might as well expect that from a Reading Quaker.\r\n\r\n_Englishman_—“I borrow a light from your intelligence.”\r\n\r\n_Native_—“Hao shwo! You are very polite.”\r\n\r\n_E._—“How far is it from here to Sha-Ho?”\r\n\r\n_N._—“How far is it from here to Sha-Ho? Oh! you’re going to Sha-Ho,\r\nare you?”\r\n\r\n_E._—“Yes! How far is it?”\r\n\r\n_N._—“How far from here, eh? What are you going to do at Sha-Ho?”\r\n\r\n_E._—“Just going for an excursion. But how far is it?”\r\n\r\n_N._—“Just going for an excursion, eh?”\r\n\r\nThis sort of thing goes on until you thoroughly lose your temper,\r\nseeing which an old man in the crowd holds up his forefinger and\r\nthumb in an oracular manner. This to the initiated signifies that\r\nSha-Ho is eight (not two) li distant (the li is about one-third of a\r\nmile). The Chinese have a way of counting with their fingers, which\r\nis as necessary to learn as the numerals of the spoken language. They\r\nconstantly answer a question of figures by holding up one hand without\r\nspeaking. Up to five it is all plain sailing, but beyond that it is not\r\nso easy. The thumb and little finger mean _six_; thumb and two first\r\nfingers, _seven_; thumb and forefinger, _eight_, forefinger crooked,\r\n_nine_; second finger doubled over forefinger, or whole hand shown,\r\nfirst palm and then back, _ten_.\r\n\r\nWe passed our first night at Chang-ping-chou, which was a slight\r\nroundabout, but my companion wanted to see the Ming tombs about which\r\nI wrote to you last autumn. We found all the inns full, but a small\r\nbeggar boy, who, possibly with an eye to copper cash, took a great\r\ninterest in our proceedings, led us to a neat little inn outside the\r\nwalls where we were quiet and cleanly lodged.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                       _24th April._\r\n\r\nWe had all the trouble in life this morning to get the mules to start.\r\nThreats of stoppages of pay were the only means of acting on the\r\nmuleteers. Even so we only got off by eight o’clock. The doctor and\r\nI, accompanied by my man Chang Hsi, were to visit the tombs, while\r\nthe mules, not being supposed capable of deriving either profit or\r\namusement from the sight, were to precede us to Nan-Ko̔u, and there\r\nwait our arrival. The valley of the tombs was not so bright and rich as\r\nwhen I saw it with the autumn crops in all their luxuriance, but there\r\nwere plenty of wild-flowers, dog-violets, wild iris, convolvulus, and\r\nothers, and the persimmon trees were a mass of bloom. The avenue of\r\nmonstrous statues appeared tame to me in the glare of day after having\r\nseen their weird and ghostly appearance by moonlight, but the site and\r\nbuildings must always be striking. There are plenty of temples and\r\npalaces in and near Peking as large and as magnificent, but none in\r\nsuch good proportion; they all look like “imitation” by the side of the\r\nThirteen Tombs.\r\n\r\nWe had to ride back to within a few hundred yards of Chang-ping-chou\r\nbefore we could reach the sandy and stony road which leads to Nan-Ko̔u.\r\nIt was burning hot, but as the Russians say, “Heat breaks no bones,”\r\nand with fresh, pure air to breathe it does not much signify how hot\r\nit is. In Peking it is another matter. We reached Nan-Ko̔u at 2 P.M.\r\nThe little town is prettily situated at the bottom of the famous pass\r\nto which it gives its name. Steep cliffs enclose it on either side; a\r\nstream of clear water—rare sight in these parts—passes through it; and\r\nthe cottages in the valley are surrounded by trees and corn-fields.\r\nThe hills are wild and bold, with here and there bits of wall, towers,\r\nand perhaps a temple or shrine on the ridges. The constant tinkling of\r\ncamel and mule bells testifies to the amount of traffic. Every other\r\nhouse is an inn, and all seem bustling and prosperous. There was plenty\r\nof movement and plenty of noise in our inn-yard; muleteers, carters,\r\nfootpads, poultry, and asses kept up a perpetual wrangling, crowing,\r\nand braying, while an improvisatore in the kitchen opposite was earning\r\nhis night’s board and lodging by reciting tales of an unedifying\r\ncharacter for the benefit of the host and his guests of lower degree.\r\nAlthough we had arrived so early, we thought it better to stop the\r\nnight at Nan-Ko̔u and go on in the morning, so we had time for a stroll\r\namong the hills after dinner.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                       _25th April._\r\n\r\nWe started at six, riding donkeys in order to spare the ponies the\r\nrough work of the pass. The Nan-Ko̔u pass is certainly in its way\r\nvery fine. The valley, which is a gradual ascent, is bounded on either\r\nside by steep, abrupt hills, as barren and wild as a Scotch glen; a\r\nfew trees stud it at intervals, and a narrow thread of water runs\r\nthrough it. There are plenty of shrines about, and always perched upon\r\ncliffs so steep that one is lost in wonder how they ever got there.\r\nAmongst these I noticed a form of sacred monument that was new to me,\r\nbut constantly repeated along this road—five white-washed earthen\r\ncones like sugar-loaves, with bats[14] or other emblems rudely painted\r\non them; I guess that they represent the five offerings exposed on\r\nBuddhist altars. As an instance of the difficulty of obtaining reliable\r\ninformation, and to show how cautiously travellers’ statements about\r\nChina must be accepted, I asked three respectable Chinese by the road\r\nwhat was the meaning of these five cones. One said that they were to\r\nkeep off foxes and wolves, another that they marked every five li along\r\nthe road, and the third that they were Buddhist emblems, but he did\r\nnot know what they represented. The pass itself, considering that it\r\nis the highway between Mongolia and China, is a very miracle of bad\r\nroads. It is as if nature had in some stupendous convulsion burst a\r\npassage through the mountains, leaving all the débris in the most\r\nglorious confusion, which man has been too idle to reduce to order.\r\nHuge boulders of rock at every step obstruct a way which is difficult\r\nenough already, and the overhanging cliffs seem as if they were on the\r\npoint of throwing down more masses to block up the road. Asses are\r\nfar the best mounts for this work. Ours carried us capitally, urged\r\nby constant revilings from their rascally drivers. “Egg of a turtle!\r\nwhat are you stopping for!” is the mildest of their adjurations, the\r\nturtle not being used as significative of slowness, but as an euphemism\r\nfor cuckold. There are plenty of villages in the pass; the inhabitants\r\ndo a small trade in tea, hard-boiled eggs, and laopings (a sort of\r\ngirdle-cake), which they sell to wayfarers. There is one very pretty\r\nlittle town, Chu-Yung-Kwan, with a curious old gateway richly carved\r\nwith quaint figures and inscriptions in Chinese, Manchu, Mongolian,\r\nand Thibetan, said to be a relic of the Yuan or Mongol dynasty. At\r\nthe top of the pass, just before the slight descent which leads to\r\nthe plateau on the west, is an old ruined fortified enclosure called\r\nPa Ta Ling, “the eight great peaks.” It is a curious place, for the\r\ninside is literally a heap of ruins and rubbish, while the walls and\r\nfortifications are almost perfect.\r\n\r\nWe breakfasted at Cha Tao at the end of the pass, some 15 miles, and\r\nvery tiring miles too, from Nan-Ko̔u. After Cha Tao the road lies along\r\na sandy plain, probably once a lake, to Hwai Lai Hsien, a pretty model\r\nof a Chinese town, with crenelated walls and quaint towers. East of\r\nthe town is a small river, spanned by what once has been a handsome\r\nfive-arched bridge, now of course falling into ruin and decay. Hard by,\r\non a low hill, stands a temple like an Italian monastery. We put up for\r\nthe night at Hwai Lai Hsien, having ridden some 35 miles from Nan-Ko̔u.\r\nWe had some difficulty in finding an inn. The people of the east side\r\nof the town sent us to the west, and the people of the west incited us\r\nto go back to the east. The mules and servants were behind us, and we\r\nwere left entirely to our own resources. At last my horse decided the\r\nquestion by bolting down a courtyard, which turned out to be that of\r\nthe best inn in the place, but which, it having no signboard, I had\r\nmissed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                       _26th April._\r\n\r\nWe had a dullish ride to-day to Hsin Pao An, passing a few small towns,\r\nall fortified, probably against Mongol invasions; at one of these, Tu\r\nMu, we made our mid-day halt. Hsin Pao An is a very pretty little town.\r\nOne Chinese town is generally so like another that if you have seen\r\none you have seen all. Here, however, there is a very curious building\r\nin the middle of the place; it is a sort of compromise between an\r\nEnglish town-hall, a mediæval fortress, and a Chinese temple; it gives\r\na distinction to the town. It is so very rare to see a drunken man in\r\nChina that it is almost worth recording that one rushed into our rooms\r\nhere, and was proceeding to lay hands on the doctor, who shook him off\r\nin great astonishment, when the people of the inn came in and turned\r\nhim out, with many apologies for the annoyance.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                       _27th April._\r\n\r\nThe main feature in the plain on leaving Hsin Pao An is a steep\r\nmountain, or rather precipitous and jagged rock, perhaps 800 or 1000\r\nfeet high, called Nei Nei Shan. It stands at the western end of\r\nthe plain, immediately to the east of the Yang Ho, “sheep river,”\r\nwhich winds beneath it. On the very summit of this rock is a temple,\r\nabout which there is a legend which reminds one of Rolandseck and\r\nNonnenwerth. A prince of these parts had engaged to throw a bridge over\r\nthe river in a single night, or forfeit his life. He set about his\r\ntask, but when the sun rose in the morning the work was unfinished, so\r\nin despair and in fulfilment of his vow he threw himself into the river\r\nand was drowned. His widow erected this temple that she might pass\r\nher life in mourning in constant sight of the spot where her husband\r\nhad disappeared. I have the very worst authority for this legend, of\r\nwhich, by the bye, Bell gives another version quoted by Michie. The\r\nChinese about the place have never heard of it; however, I dare say it\r\nis as true as most other legends; at any rate there stand the hill and\r\nthe temple, and there live (heaven knows how) five priests, exposed\r\nto the full glare of the sun, and to every cold wind that blows, and\r\nobliged to fetch even the water they drink up an almost inaccessible\r\nheight from the plain below. This day’s journey, following the Yang Ho\r\nin a north-westerly direction, was very picturesque and varied, but\r\noften rocky to a degree. However, our little Mongol horses behaved\r\nlike goats; they never stumble except on a flat road, where they get\r\ncareless and lazy. There is plenty of coal in these hills, which is\r\nworked in the meanest manner and sent to Peking on camels. A geologist\r\nwho has examined this part of China, and especially the mountains to\r\nthe west, affirms it to be the richest coalfield in the world, but\r\nthe Chinese do not take advantage of it. We met plenty of travellers\r\nof all degrees, the richer ones travelling in mule litters, a mode of\r\nconveyance which looks to me as if it might bring on sea-sickness; and\r\nnumberless caravans laden with tea for Russia.\r\n\r\nWe rested at a poor little town called Hsiang Shui Pu, and put up\r\nfor the night at Hsuan Hua Fu, a large district city. Here in the\r\nsuburbs we found an inn which was a palace compared with those we had\r\nput up in hitherto, though an English labourer’s cottage would not\r\nsuffer by contrast with the room I slept in. A certain amount of new\r\npaper in the windows gave a promise of cleanliness and decency within\r\nthat was not fulfilled by the broken brick floor and musty tables and\r\nbenches; however, there were plenty of shabby, tawdry lanterns, and if\r\ncharacters of good omen could give appetite and a good night’s rest,\r\nwe ought to have eaten like ogres and slept like the Seven Sleepers.\r\nWe were a good deal lionised here; indeed, the inquisitiveness of\r\nthe people was very troublesome. As I was lathering my face before\r\ndinner, trying to get rid of the deposit of two or three sandstorms,\r\nthe curse of travellers in North China, a carter walked coolly into\r\nmy bedroom smoking his pipe, and went into fits of laughter at the\r\nsight. I, irritated by the intrusion, flung the contents of my soapy\r\nsponge into his face—which must have very much astonished it, for it\r\nwas much in the same state as the fists of the Irish boatman two years\r\nafter he had shaken hands with the Lord Lieutenant; and my enemy\r\nfled howling. Presently another gentleman appeared who addressed me\r\nas “Venerable Teacher”—a high compliment—and informed me that his\r\nname was Ma, and that he was a merchant of caps travelling from west\r\nto east; after which he retired, but shortly put his head in again to\r\nask my honourable name and nation, and I heard him afterwards in the\r\nyard explaining to a knot of carters, muleteers, and loungers, that\r\nI was the English teacher Mi, that I understood good manners, that\r\nmy body was all over pockets, and that my years were not few; which\r\nstatements the auditors received with many grunts and eructations and\r\nrepeated several times, afterwards one by one sauntering up to judge\r\nfor themselves. I happened to be emptying my pockets at the time of\r\nMa’s visit. Pockets are not used by the Chinese; they have, it is true,\r\npurses or pouches at their girdle, but they are very small. The chief\r\nreceptacle for miscellaneous articles is the boot. My first teacher\r\nused to pull writing materials and sugar-plums indiscriminately from\r\nhis boot, and always politely offered me the latter before tasting\r\nthem himself. Old Hêng-Chi, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who is\r\n_malade imaginaire_ and always dosing himself, constantly pulls pills\r\nor other pet remedies out of his boot. European pockets are always\r\nprovocative of wonder. The noises of the inn-yard made sleep out of\r\nthe question till long past midnight. The worst of all was an old\r\ncarter wrapped up in his sheepskin, sitting on the shaft of his cart\r\nand beating a sort of death-watch with a stick on a piece of hollow\r\nbamboo, like a ghoulish old woodpecker. I went out and tried to chaff\r\nhim out of his performance, but he took my irony for high praise, which\r\nso delighted him that he every now and then burst into snatches of song\r\nin a high squeaky falsetto, never stopping his eternal devil’s tattoo.\r\nMules, asses, horses, and quarrelling Chinamen made up a fitting chorus.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                             _Saturday, 28th April._\r\n\r\nRode through the town of Hsuên Hwa Fu, which, for China, is in\r\ntolerable repair. Though small as “Fu’s” go, it is pretty enough.\r\nThere are plenty of trees, chiefly huge willows and poplars, and a\r\ngreat variety of quaint towers, pagodas, and other buildings. The\r\nplain below is busily tilled, and, I should think, must be fertile;\r\nbut the crops are far behind those of the Peking plain, and the first\r\nsowings have not yet put out shoots. Here amongst the numerous by-roads\r\nand water-courses we lost our way, being, as usual, far ahead of our\r\nmules. Seeing a group of boys working a few fields off I rode across\r\nto ask the way; their backs were turned to me, and it was only when I\r\njumped over a low mud wall into the midst of them that they perceived\r\nme. A shark appearing in Cuckoo weir while the Eton boys are bathing,\r\ncould not have produced a greater panic. With one consent the urchins\r\nshouted out, “The Devil! The Devil!” and bolted for dear life. At last\r\nI succeeded in capturing and calming one of them, sufficiently to\r\ndiscover that we were about an hour and a half’s ride out of the right\r\nroad (no joke to men fasting and under such a sun). The deviation from\r\nthe regular route accounted for the terror caused by my appearance; the\r\nboys had probably never seen a foreigner before.\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon we reached Chang Chia Ko̔u, which the Mongols\r\ncall Khalgan, the frontier town between China and Mongolia. It is the\r\nfirst great halting-place on the road from Peking to Moscow. Formerly,\r\nwhen the importation of tea into Russia by sea was forbidden, the whole\r\nof the tea-supply passed from Tientsing through Chang Chia Ko̔u, and\r\nthere is still a great traffic, but, of course, it is much diminished.\r\nThe Russians have no important export trade to China. They have a\r\nsmall export trade in cloth, which they manufacture, of a kind and\r\nat a cost with which other producers cannot compete, for their cloth\r\nexactly suits the Chinese, being of pure wool, very broad, and cheap;\r\nbut they cannot send it in any large quantity. At Peking, Tientsing,\r\nand some of the large towns in North China, there are also to be found\r\nmiscellaneous articles of Russian manufacture, such as samovars,\r\nknives, prints, looking-glasses, etc., but, as a rule, Siberia being\r\na non-manufacturing country and too short-handed to become one, goods\r\nhave to come from too far for their transport to pay. I believe that\r\nthe Russians have found their connection with China to be, on the\r\nwhole, a losing business. They have to pay silver—paper roubles will\r\nnot pass—for their tea, and must continue to do so as long as they\r\ncannot establish an export trade; they are trying to obtain certain\r\nrights of trading in Mongolia, but the Chinese cannot be persuaded\r\nof the justice of transferring a monopoly of their own merchants to\r\na powerful neighbour. In the far north they have obtained certain\r\nharbours which open the Chinese seas and the Pacific to them; but the\r\nharbours are frozen for several months, and the advantage has saddled\r\nthem with huge tracts of country which it is hard for them to rule,\r\nand still harder for want of manual labour to turn to profit. Russia\r\nlooks to the days of railways and telegraphs through Siberia, which\r\nare probably not very far distant,[15] to balance the account. The\r\ntruth is that the English and Americans are the only people who have a\r\nreal commercial interest in China. The Russian interest is at present\r\nsimply one of boundaries. With the French the Chinese question is\r\none of missionaries and jealousy of the _interests_ of other nations\r\nin the Far East,—_interests_ being with French alarmists synonymous\r\nwith _influence_. The German nations cannot as yet be said to have\r\nany great stake here, though they have plenty of subjects in China,\r\nprincipally clerks in great houses or small merchants. Portugal has a\r\nvery cleverly worded treaty with the Chinese, who will not ratify it\r\nbecause it would cede to her the sovereignty of Macao, where she has a\r\nflourishing trade, under the name of Chinese coolie emigration. Spain\r\nhas a treaty in an embryo state, and conterminal interests on account\r\nof her Philippine Islands; and Belgium has a treaty, one resident\r\nsubject, and a ship trading here once in three years or so. The Danes\r\nhave a treaty, but little commerce. Italy two or three years ago\r\nplanned a mission hither, but it broke down. Even should the Russians\r\nsucceed in obtaining the privileges they are working for in Mongolia,\r\ntheir Chinese trade would be but a drop in the ocean compared with our\r\nimmense commercial interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                       _29th April._\r\n\r\nIn spite of the remonstrances and even tears of our head muleteer, who\r\npredicted certain starvation for ourselves and our mules, we decided on\r\npushing as far as Llama Miao, the great horse-fair in Mongolia, and\r\nreturning home _via_ Ku Pei Ko̔u to vary the journey. We accordingly\r\nresolved to stop a day at Chang Chia Ko̔u to rest the horses and lay\r\nin rice, flour, and other provisions, with provender for the cattle.\r\nThe delay gave us time to see the bustling little town which trade has\r\nredeemed from the dulness of its neighbours. The streets are full of\r\nanimation. Fortune-tellers, improvisatori, and a company of strolling\r\nactors who, gorgeous in stage dresses and burlesque “makes up,” have\r\ntaken possession of a small temple, attract crowds of gaping Mongols\r\nand Chinamen. The main street of the suburb resembles a great fair,\r\nlined with stalls like cheap-jack’s booths, at which every conceivable\r\nsort of rubbish is sold. Pipes, rings, ear-rings, sham jewelry and\r\njade, Mongol knives, purses, cutlery professing to be made by Rodgers\r\nand Son, lucifer matches from Vienna, kaleidoscopes, stereoscopes,\r\nmusical boxes and looking-glasses, with reverses quite unfit for\r\npublication, are the chief wares. There is a capital seven-arched\r\nbridge, adorned with lions and apes, across the almost dry river;\r\nand wonderful to say, it is kept in repair, so you may judge how\r\nprosperous the place is and looks. Foreigners excite little attention,\r\nfor European travellers are often passing; and besides, there are two\r\nor three resident agents for Russian houses who superintend the loading\r\nof the tea-caravans for Siberia.\r\n\r\nOne thing necessary before leaving Chang Chia Ko̔u was to get the\r\nseal of the military authorities attached as a _visa_ to my passport.\r\nAs I told you last year, the petty provincial officers snap their\r\nfingers at the seal of the Peking yamêns (public offices), but they\r\nrespect that of their own immediate chief, whose arm is long enough to\r\nreach them. In the event of meeting with any difficulty on the road I\r\ncould not count on getting any official assistance without this seal.\r\nAccordingly, early this morning I sent my passport to the general’s\r\noffice, with the request that it might be returned _visé_. At five\r\no’clock no passport was forthcoming, so I sent to say that I would go\r\nin person to fetch it, and requested an interview with his Excellency.\r\nWhen I arrived at the Yamên I was told that the great man himself was\r\nill—the usual excuse—but I was civilly received by his subordinate,\r\na greasy little blue-buttoned mandarin named Pao, and two others. I\r\nrepeated my request to see his Excellency Ah (that is his name), as I\r\nknew how futile it is to treat with subordinate Chinese officials; but\r\n_his_ Excellency only renewed his regrets that he could not see _my_\r\nExcellency, which he hoped was pretty well. As he might be smoking\r\nopium and really unpresentable, I thought it better not to press the\r\nmatter further, but attacked Pao on the subject of the seal, which he\r\nfought off granting me on the ground that there was nothing in the\r\npassport saying that I was entitled to it. I answered that the passport\r\nentitled me to expect every aid from him, and that last year the\r\nTi-tu of Ku Pei Ko̔u had granted us his seal; threatened him with the\r\nthunders of the Prince of Kung’s wrath, and told him (Heaven forgive\r\nme!) how angry our Queen would be if she heard that a member of her\r\nLegation, carrying the passport of the Legation, had been snubbed the\r\nvery first time he asked for assistance from a Chinese official. “Would\r\nI like something to eat?” “I was much obliged, but I was not hungry;\r\nI wanted the seal.” “At least a little jam?” “Many thanks, no jam,\r\nbut the seal.” “But the seal was really such an unimportant matter.”\r\n“Then why not give it at once as the Ti-tu had done.” (Which, by the\r\nbye, he had not done without a fight.) “Oh, but the Ti-tu lived at Ku\r\nPei Ko̔u and this was Chang Chia Ko̔u. How could it be done?” “Where\r\nthere’s a will there’s a way”—which is an excellent Chinese proverb.\r\nMy interlocutors doubled at every moment like hares, now offering\r\ntea, now dinner, now tobacco, anything but the seal. They constantly\r\nconsulted together in Manchu, of which of course I did not understand a\r\nword. Every now and then one went out to report, as I imagine, to the\r\nshamming chief what I had said. How obstinate the barbarian was, and\r\nhow suspicious, for I took care to let them know that I was not gulled\r\nby the very stale sick dodge. We were more than an hour marching and\r\ncountermarching over the same ground. I stuck out for my seal; they\r\npersisted in eluding the question. At last I told Pao that I would\r\neither accept the seal or a separate pass from his Excellency Ah to his\r\nsubordinates, but that if they refused to give me one or other I would\r\nwrite to Peking and complain of their want of courtesy. After some\r\ndifficulty they agreed to furnish me with a pass, and even gave orders\r\nfor a draft to be written and sent to the hotel for my approval. I\r\nthen left them, but with such manifest disgust that they were probably\r\nafraid that I might complain of their conduct, for immediately I\r\nreached the inn a messenger made his appearance, saying that Pao hoped\r\nI was pretty well (which, considering we had just parted, was an excess\r\nof courtesy), and had not quite read my passport to his satisfaction;\r\nwould I let him have it back for a few minutes. Ten minutes after this\r\nit was in my hands with the seal attached.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime our lachrymose muleteers had made off to Peking with\r\ntheir mules, abandoning their pack-saddles and ropes, and forfeiting\r\nall their earnings, save an advance which I had made them, rather than\r\nface the imaginary horrors of the road to Llama Miao. Here was a pretty\r\nkettle of fish! All hopes of an early start completely bowled out; and\r\nreally Chang Chia Ko̔u is a very nice place, but one day is enough of\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                       _30th April._\r\n\r\nThe whole of this morning was wasted in fruitless endeavours to get\r\nmules or carts. The carters and muleteers, knowing our anxiety to be\r\noff, demanded fabulous prices, and absolutely declined to start until\r\nto-morrow; we were as determined to make a move to-day. At last, in\r\ndespair, the doctor rode off to the Russian agents to see whether\r\nthey could not do something to help us. It is no use applying to the\r\nauthorities, for their practice in such cases is to be extremely\r\ncivil and obliging, at once procure the worst and cheapest beasts in\r\nthe place, arrange for a high price, and pocket the difference; and\r\nthen when the traveller is a hundred miles or so away from all help\r\na horse or mule dies of a ripe old age, and the others are so feeble\r\nand decrepit that he does not reach his destination until his stock\r\nof provisions has long been exhausted, and himself has had to suffer\r\ndays of needless privation and discomfort. During the doctor’s absence\r\nChang Hsi, who had gone out as plenipotentiary in another direction,\r\ncame back with a treaty for ratification between himself, under the\r\nstyle of “Chang the great Lord,” and a hirer of carts, who was willing\r\nto convey our baggage to Llama Miao for rather more than double the\r\nproper fare. The doctor’s negotiations were more successful, for he\r\nreturned with a wild-looking ruffian, with whom we finally made almost\r\nsatisfactory arrangements, though neither promising, coaxing, nor\r\nthreatening would induce him to start until the next day.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          _1st May._\r\n\r\nA short time since a missionary presented me with a copy of the\r\n_Pilgrim’s Progress_ translated into Chinese, and adorned with\r\npictures, in which Christian and the other characters appear with\r\nlong tails _à la Chinoise_. If any one will produce a similar edition\r\nof _Don Quixote_ for the benefit of the mandarins, I shall recommend\r\nour carter as model for the portrait of the knight. His prominent\r\nnose, lantern jaws, and tall, thin, ungainly figure exactly fit the\r\ncharacter; it is a type I never before saw in China. Any one of his\r\nhorses would make a capital Rosinante. We made a late start of it,\r\nnot getting off until eight o’clock, and even then our people lagged\r\nbehind in the town to buy things. At the gate of the town, where the\r\nGreat Wall of China is the frontier mark, we met with no difficulties,\r\nour passports were not examined, and the officials only took down\r\nour names and the number of our party. The day’s march was dull and\r\nmonotonous; it lay along a continuously ascending pass, winding between\r\nbarren hills, which bounded the view. We met strings of camels, mules,\r\nand bullock-carts, all laden with tea for Russia and Mongolia. The tea\r\nthat is imported by the Mongols is of the coarsest quality, and pressed\r\ninto large bricks, which look something like cavendish tobacco, only\r\ncoarser, and with stronger fibres to bind them together. These bricks\r\nare in some parts the current coin of the country: large transactions\r\nare settled for so many bricks of tea, while smaller payments are made\r\nby cutting pieces off the block as the Chinese cut fragments of silver.\r\nThe infusion made from brick tea is coarse and nasty; it often has a\r\nmusty taste owing to the damp confined in the cakes, which prevents\r\ntheir transport by sea.\r\n\r\nWe breakfasted at Tu-ting, a miserable little village of mud hovels\r\nwhich at a little distance look like mere holes in the hill; the place\r\nreminded me of a colony of fever-stricken Circassians whom I saw during\r\ntheir exodus two years ago, burrowing like rabbits in a bank near\r\nTchernavoda. Barring the fever there was not much choice in appearance\r\nbetween the two. After Tu-ting the ascent becomes so steep that horses\r\nare kept by the wayside, as on the St. Gothard, to draw up heavy carts\r\nto a ledge on which stands a temple in honour of Kwan Ti, the god of\r\nwar, whither pious carters repair to deposit an offering on having\r\nsuccessfully made the ascent. Pa Ta, where we passed the night at the\r\nsign of the “Ten Thousand Perfections,” was hardly richer than Tu-ting.\r\nOur beds were made in the kitchen amid flour-bins, jars of oil, pots of\r\nstinking cheese, and odds and ends of all sorts. It was the best room\r\nof the inn, which was a low hut built of mud and chopped straw, roofed\r\nover, but with the bare ground for a floor. This is not comfort, but _à\r\nla guerre comme à la guerre_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          _2nd May._\r\n\r\nA couple of hours more uphill and we were fairly on the Mongolian\r\nplateau. A branch of the Great Wall runs along the mountains; but\r\nhere it is a mere heap of stones thrown together, a wonderful work of\r\npatience, it is true, but lacking the grandeur of the brick-built wall\r\nat Ku Pei Ko̔u; at intervals are rude turrets fallen or falling into\r\nutter decay.\r\n\r\nThe plateau itself is a vast sea of downs bounded only by the horizon.\r\nIt is difficult to conceive anything more desolate; there is neither\r\ntree nor shrub, nothing taller than a few dwarfish buttercups and\r\ncampanulas; there is not so much as a stone to sit down upon; for miles\r\nand miles there is no trace of human habitation or handiwork; for miles\r\nand miles one travels without meeting a soul, except by chance a stray\r\nMongol lumbering heavily along on his camel, or a bullock-cart carrying\r\ntea; of beasts we saw a flock of Hwang-yang antelopes, that scampered\r\noff almost before there was time to recognise them; the dogs started a\r\nfox; a raven was feeding on a dead dog, and a solitary vulture followed\r\nin our wake for hours, as if he expected one or other of us to come to\r\ngrief, but for to-day he was disappointed. We rested at Shi Pa Li Tai,\r\nhaving made an absurdly short day’s journey, but it was impossible to\r\nstir our Don Quixote into anything like activity.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          _3rd May._\r\n\r\nWe rose long before sunrise, intending to make up for lost time. The\r\nearly morning on the steppes is something beautiful. Flocks of larks,\r\nmocking and other birds are singing away as if their throats must\r\nburst, the air is as keen and fresh as possible, and there is just a\r\nsparkling of dew on the ground. On such a morning and on such ground\r\nour little horses, in spite of the journey before them—of which they\r\nalways seem to have a sort of instinctive knowledge, for when the\r\nholsters and headstalls are put on, the very worst of them sober down\r\nand behave well—cannot resist a gallop. They lift their heads, and\r\nturning towards the breeze sniff it in by long draughts with a zest\r\nthat it is good to see, and spin away like mad things over the steppe\r\non which they were born and reared. The dogs catch the infection, and\r\nare in the most tearing spirits, careering away far out of sight;\r\nDrujok, whose sporting education has been sadly neglected, setting a\r\nbad example in a wild lark chase, which my puppy Prince is not slow\r\nto follow. Roads across the plateau there are none; and we soon\r\nraced away from all sign of the (at best) puzzling tracks of rare\r\ncarts and horses. Here was a pretty mess! Lost on the steppe like\r\nsailors at sea in a cock-boat without a compass! not a landmark of any\r\nsort; a boundless plain with a round horizon! After some while spent\r\nin fruitless consultation, to our joy a speck began to rise on the\r\nhorizon; bigger and bigger it grew, until at last it defined itself\r\ninto the figure of a very jolly, fat, yellow-robed priest,—a sort of\r\nMongol Friar Tuck riding on his camel,—who could fortunately speak\r\na little Chinese. The good-natured fellow, shaking his sides with\r\nlaughter at our mischance, put his helm about and rode a mile or two\r\nout of his own way to steer us into ours, so that in the end we found\r\nourselves at Pan Shan Tu a couple of hours before our people. As we\r\nhad started at three in the morning on the strength of a cup of tea\r\nand a couple of eggs, and had been eight hours in the saddle, it was\r\nrather trying to wait until past one o’clock for a meal. Still more\r\ntrying was it as the evening closed in, and the gathering clouds warned\r\nus that there would be no moonlight to guide us, to find ourselves 25\r\nmiles from our destination, in the middle of the wilderness, and the\r\ncart-horses hardly up to 3 miles an hour. Happily we came upon a group\r\nof Mongol yurts (huts or tents), and their uncouth owners were willing\r\nand able to take us in. Indeed, as I found out afterwards, the huts on\r\nthis track are almost available as inns for travellers. We were, as\r\nusual, in advance of our party and unable to speak a word of Mongol;\r\nhowever, from the yurts there appeared a wild, gaunt figure, which from\r\nits wearing ear-rings and long hair, and from no other sign, I knew to\r\nbe a woman; in the kindliest but roughest manner she seized the horses\r\nand led them to a post, to which she tied them, and then opening one\r\nof the yurts, beckoned us to go in and warm ourselves, for it was very\r\nchilly. In this hut were crowded a few men, women, and naked children,\r\na calf and several lambs, all huddling together round the fire: what an\r\netching Rembrandt would have made of it! The air was stifling; between\r\nsmoke and strong smells it was almost impossible to breathe; however,\r\nthe good lady cleared out another hut, which by the time our servants\r\ncame up was ready for us.\r\n\r\nA Mongol yurt is of the simplest construction. A round, raised floor,\r\nfrom twelve to fifteen feet in diameter, is made of mud and chopped\r\nstraw; round this is built a wall of trellis-work of laths about four\r\nfeet high, from which a number of sticks radiate to a point at the top;\r\na thick covering of pieces of felt tied on with strong cord completes\r\nthe hut; even the trellis-work is fastened by thongs of leather passed\r\nthrough holes made at the point where the laths cross one another. The\r\nwhole can easily be taken to pieces and packed on a camel’s back. The\r\nfurniture of the interior is not more luxurious than the exterior: in\r\nthe centre is an iron fireplace, in which is burnt a fire of horse-\r\nor cow-dung, which is the only fuel to be procured, and is collected\r\nwith great pains on the plateau; the smoke, so much at least as does\r\nescape, finds its way through a hole in the middle of the roof; four\r\niron bars support over the fire the single pan in which all the cooking\r\nof the family is done; round the tent are a few chests and presses of\r\nthe rudest Chinese manufacture, and the homeliest of brass pots and\r\npans from Peking; a few sheep-skins and calf-skins and pieces of felt\r\nrepresent bed, sofa, and chair; the whole is blackened by much smoke\r\nlike a cutty-pipe. A flap of felt serves as door; the hole in the roof\r\nis chimney and window in one, and if it rains that must be covered in.\r\nPerhaps the quaintest thing about the place, and the strongest sign\r\nof the poverty of the land, was the kitchen garden inside the yurt.\r\nA basket or pan and a broken teacup, into which a little mould had\r\nbeen placed, were beds in which half a dozen carefully-tended heads of\r\ngarlic were sprouting! There were no stables; the Mongols do not use\r\nthem. When they want a horse they go and catch one out of the herd. Our\r\nhorses were tied up to stakes outside. The cattle keep near the camp of\r\ntheir own accord; the sheep are packed under a shed, so they enjoy a\r\ncovering; but the young things—calves, lambs, and kids—are carried into\r\nthe yurts and sleep with the other children. Such was our lodging for\r\nthe night, and, tired as we were, it did well enough for us. Our dinner\r\nwas a more difficult matter; our cook did his best for us, but he was\r\nsorely put to it for saucepans and other requisites. As I said above,\r\nthe pan or caldron over the dung-fire is the whole Mongol _batterie de\r\ncuisine_. Into it is thrown a quantity of millet or other grain and\r\na few lumps of fat mutton or beef, which is stewed in water. When the\r\nsolid part of this has been taken out, the greasy water which remains\r\nserves to make the infusion of brick tea. Even the lowest Chinese\r\ncannot stomach this nasty mess, and speak of it with the greatest\r\ndisgust. In some parts of Mongolia an infusion of brick tea is made\r\nwith boiling milk and salt, and always kept ready in the yurt. This is\r\nsaid to be very good. I had been looking forward to getting a drink of\r\nfresh milk, but the Mongols all say that their cows have died. Calves a\r\nfew days old, and in very good condition, tell another story.\r\n\r\nWhen we had established ourselves in the yurt, the head of the\r\nencampment, introduced by the Meg Merrilies who had taken us in and\r\ndone for us, and whom I imagine to have been his wife, came to visit\r\nus. He spoke a little Chinese, which is necessary to him when he goes\r\nto Chang Chia Ko̔u to sell his cattle. He told us he was a military\r\nofficer, but without soldiers to command. Of the world beyond Chang\r\nChia Ko̔u on one side and Llama Miao on the other he knew nothing.\r\nHis flocks and his tents were his whole life. The women, young and\r\nold, had no objection to showing themselves; they came to look at us,\r\nand brought their children, whom we made happy with cakes and white\r\nsugar. Round-faced, flat-featured, healthy, dirty, and ugly are the\r\nwomen; as for the men, sun, wind, and weather have burnt and hardened\r\nthem to a degree in comparison with which the most weather-beaten old\r\nsea-dog at Portsmouth or Plymouth is satin-skinned. Men and women alike\r\nare dressed in long sheep-skin robes, with the wool worn inwards, and\r\nround fur caps. Their shapeless dresses and round head-pieces remind\r\none of the family in the Noah’s arks. The people appear very jolly\r\nand simple, which they are, and very honest, which report says they\r\nare not. Small articles to which they may take a fancy are said to\r\ndisappear mysteriously. The Mongolian dogs, several of whom guard\r\neach encampment, to the great discomfiture of Drujok and Prince, who,\r\non the prowl after water, are constantly attacked by them, are fine\r\nbeasts—huge, shaggy fellows, mostly black-and-tan, with glorious tails\r\ncurling over their backs; they must be awkward customers. In spite of\r\nthe squalor in which our hosts live, they are rich people in their\r\nway, and well-to-do; dirt and wretchedness must be with them a matter\r\nof choice, not necessity, for their thriving flocks find a ready market\r\nat Chang Chia Ko̔u for the supply of Peking. Things which are of the\r\nmost ordinary necessity to the poorest Chinaman these comparatively\r\nprosperous people do without. They have not even a teapot or teacup;\r\nand when we suggested washing our faces a rusty old iron basin was\r\ndragged out of some corner where it must have lain unused and forgotten\r\nfor months.\r\n\r\nIt blew a gale of wind in the night, and rain came on, so we were able\r\nto test the comfort of the tent. We suffered neither from cold nor\r\nrain; in fact, nothing could be better adapted than these huts for the\r\nextreme weather of the steppe. If it is fine you can sleep with the sky\r\nabove you. If it is cold the felt is a sufficient protection. It was\r\nbitterly chilly outside, but within, although we could not bear a fire\r\non account of the smoke, we were as warm as toasts.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          _4th May._\r\n\r\nA pelting wet morning. We took leave of our friends the Mongols, and\r\nrode to Chang-ma-tsze-chin, a Chinese colony, some twenty miles off, it\r\nbeing too bad weather to push farther. We made friends with the whole\r\nvillage through its children. A pedlar happened to be passing that way,\r\nand by investing a few pence in small looking-glasses and such toys, we\r\nmade the little boys and girls very happy. To these the pedlar’s pack\r\nof rubbish contained all the wonders of Aladdin’s palace, for had he\r\nnot come all the way from Peking? Our door at the inn was thronged with\r\njolly little urchins for the rest of the day, and we amused ourselves\r\nand them by showing them our watches, pencil-cases, etc. The plains\r\nor valleys here are narrower and surrounded by hills. I climbed one\r\nheight, from which I had a fine view over the steppe.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          _5th May._\r\n\r\nThe beauty of the morning made up for yesterday. We were up by 3 A.M.\r\nThe vapours of the night before had settled down in dew on the ground,\r\nthe sun was rising brilliantly among fleecy clouds, which continued\r\nall day to throw over the hills lights and shades such as one sees in\r\nEurope—never at Peking, where the sky must either be black with storm,\r\nor deep blue without a speck upon it. We stopped to breakfast at a\r\nMongol encampment, on the near side of an immense plain. I never saw so\r\nmany horses at one time in my life—the plateau was literally alive with\r\nthem; they were very shaggy in their winter coats, and did not show to\r\nadvantage on the poor commons they had had to put up with during the\r\nwinter; but some of them were well built for strength and endurance,\r\nwith deep chests, strong quarters, and big barrels. We were received in\r\nthe yurt of a widow, named Apakwai, a most ill-favoured dame; however,\r\nher tent was the best in the place, and the cleanest, which is not high\r\npraise. She was rich in furniture, skins, and felt mats, and there was\r\neven some little attempt at decoration about her habitation, a few\r\nChinese prints of the rudest kind and most defiant of perspective being\r\npasted on the trellis walls; they were coloured in the garish style so\r\npleasing to Mongols, who are far more Oriental in this respect than\r\nthe sober Chinese. A Mongol swell, riding over the plain, gorgeous in\r\nyellow and vermilion, and with his jolly moon face beaming out of a\r\nyellow cap, red-buttoned and trimmed with sables, is a sight to see.\r\nThe ladies are great customers with the Peking jewellers for coral,\r\npearls, and jade ornaments. A woman, be she never so poor, is sure to\r\nhave some piece of finery in the way of ear-rings or head-dress from\r\nPeking. If she cannot afford real jewellery she buys sham.\r\n\r\nThe widow Apakwai could speak no Chinese, but as every one about the\r\ncamp came in to idle away an hour, we had no lack of interpreters.\r\nThe chief personage spoke Chinese fluently. Apakwai lost her husband\r\nin the war of 1860, where the Mongols were always sent to the front\r\nto be shot at, and really, with such a wife, he was lucky to get out\r\nof the world. She had a most villainous expression of countenance,\r\nonly exceeded in ugliness by her familiar spirit, a little dog of\r\npreternatural hideousness, with a hunch on his back and a revolting\r\nhuman face. I tried to conciliate him with “po-po,” Chinese cakes,\r\nwhich he accepted with avidity, and even condescended to sit up and\r\nbeg for like a Christian dog, but so soon as my store was exhausted he\r\nsnapped at me as spitefully as ever. The old lady had other familiar\r\nspirits even more disgusting, of whose presence she gave evidence by\r\nmuch unbuttoning of robes and scratching. The widow was very eager for\r\ncigars and white sugar, which we could not spare her, and as she sat\r\nsmoking her pipe and grumbling over the money our servants had paid her\r\nfor the use of her yurt, she was the picture of greed and avarice. I\r\nadded to her gains, but even that did not satisfy her. Altogether, if\r\nI had a pound of cigars, a loaf of sugar, and a purseful of money, I\r\nshould be sorry to sleep alone in her yurt. I should dream of Jael and\r\nSisera all night.\r\n\r\nAt about two or three miles, at a guess, N.W. of the camp stands a\r\nlarge temple, Ma Shên Miao, the temple of the horse spirit, most\r\nappropriately placed and dedicated; with my field-glass I could see\r\nlarge trees, leafless as yet, in its enclosure, the only trees that\r\nwe have seen since Chang Chia Ko̔u. Their size shows that the temple\r\nis old, for of course they must have been planted there by the monks.\r\nBetween the camp and Shang-tu-ho, where we slept, the plain was\r\nboundless in length, and confined at the sides by picturesque heights\r\ncoloured by every variety of light and shade. The distance gave us the\r\nmost perfectly deceptive mirage I ever saw. It was exactly like a vast\r\nlake, the hill spurs running out into it like promontories, and forming\r\nbays and creeks. Near Shang-tu-ho we passed by the roadside four stakes\r\ndriven into the ground, to each of which was attached a cage containing\r\nthe head of a man in a frightful state of decomposition. The tail of\r\none had escaped from between the bars of the cage, and was dangling to\r\nand fro mournfully in the wind. They were the heads of four Chinese\r\nhighwaymen, once the terror of the road; now, poor wretches, they can\r\nonly frighten the horses, who may well shy at so ugly a sight. We saw\r\nlarge flocks of Hwang-yang antelopes, but they disappear like white\r\nclouds into space, and there is no chance of getting a shot at them.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          _6th May._\r\n\r\nBy way of a change, and to spare my old pony Kwandu, whose turn it\r\nwas for duty, I walked the first stage, some sixteen miles or more,\r\nto Ta Liang Ti. Two miles to the west of the road we passed the\r\nWang-ta-jên-Miao, the temple of his Excellency Wang, the burial-place\r\nof a Mongol chieftain of that name, where, as the carter told me,\r\nreside the officers in charge of an Imperial establishment for breeding\r\nhorses. A little excitement was added to the second half of the day\r\nby our being warned of a band of “chi-ma-tseih,” horse brigands, who\r\ninfest the neighbourhood. The Mongols of a large encampment near Ta\r\nLiang Ti have been waging war against them; yesterday they caught\r\nfour, the day before eight, all of whom will be sent to Chang Chia\r\nKo̔u for trial. The heads we saw yesterday belonged to four of their\r\ntroop. The ground is admirably adapted for their operations. The track\r\nskirts a number of low hills, among which they hide, pouncing out upon\r\ntravellers who are too weak in numbers to offer resistance. The people\r\nabout are really panic-stricken, and no single cart ventures on the\r\nroad. An additional cause of fear is that these brigands are Shantung\r\nmen, who have the reputation of being very terrible. The deuce a tail\r\nof a robber did we see, but we met a Mongol armed to the teeth and\r\ncarrying his long pole and rope for horse-catching—a most powerful\r\nengine against a mounted robber—who asked me, in what the Mrs.\r\nMalaprop of Peking used to call “broken china,” whether I had seen any\r\nbrigands, saying that he was one of a party out on the war-trail after\r\nthem. I could only wish him “good luck with his fishing.” We slept at\r\nHa Pa Chiao, where, as at Ta Liang Ti, the people were especially civil.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          _7th May._\r\n\r\nTo-day we “received bitters unsurpassable,” as the Chinese say when\r\nthey come to grief—thirty-five miles’ ride at a foot-pace, for we\r\ncould not leave the baggage in a storm of wind, rain, thunder and\r\nlightning, which regularly pursued us. The sandy soil was so heavy that\r\nthe cart-wheels could hardly turn; the horses were quite exhausted.\r\nAbout two miles from Llama Miao, where the storm had lashed itself to\r\nits greatest fury, we came to a small plateau surrounded by low hills.\r\nHere we witnessed a phenomenon, new to me, and which I certainly never\r\nwish to see again. The thunder, which seemed to circle round the hills,\r\nroared savagely and cracked with deafening peals, while the lightning\r\nran along the ground criss-crossing in every direction until the\r\nlittle plain was covered with a perfect network of blue liquid flames,\r\nfrom the meshes of which escape seemed impossible. The effect on the\r\nhorses was indeed electric. Mine stood still and shivered with fear,\r\nbreaking out into a white lather of sweat, while the doctor’s, with\r\na scream, bolted madly into space, fortunately taking the direction\r\nof the town. It was a weird scene, befitting a witch’s Sabbath. A\r\nthunderstorm in Mongolia is indeed a trial to one’s nerves. To put the\r\nfinishing touch to our misery, when we arrived at Llama Miao drenched,\r\ncold, and hungry, inn after inn refused to take us in, and we were for\r\nnear an hour riding through the wet streets, the people howling at us,\r\nand a whole pack of curs yelping and snapping at our dogs. At last we\r\nfound an asylum in a large but wretched inn; the last tenants of the\r\nrooms we occupied had been horses, and my bedroom was also used as a\r\ncart-house. We were a good deal mobbed; a foreigner here is a _rara\r\navis_, and we created no small sensation, every dirty ragamuffin in the\r\nplace crowding into the yard. What excites the greatest astonishment is\r\nthat we are travelling for no business. To leave all one’s comforts\r\nand ride four hundred miles for pleasure beats their comprehension, and\r\nthe Chinese are convinced that the barbarian has a bee in his bonnet.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          _8th May._\r\n\r\nLlama Miao is a large Chinese colony in the midst of a sandy desert,\r\nfour or five thousand feet above the level of the sea. The Mongols call\r\nit Talonoru, which the Russians have softened into Dolonor. The Chinese\r\nname, which means “llama’s temple,” is taken from two huge monasteries\r\nof llamas, “the old temple” and “the new temple,” which stand by the\r\nside of a small stream outside the town. They are rather villages than\r\ntemples, however, and contain, as the landlord and other natives told\r\nme, several thousand llamas. We were unable to go into them, for the\r\nriver, swollen by the rain, was impassable; but we did not much regret\r\nthis, for all the temples have a strong family likeness, and we have\r\nboth had our fill of big Buddhas and dirty shaven monks with idiotic\r\nfaces (the llamas are by far the lowest type in China), out of whom\r\nthere is not even any information about their fraternity to be got,\r\nfor if you ask them some question touching their order, it is ten to\r\none that they will reply by another about your clothes. We contented\r\nourselves with a distant view of the Miao. In size, but in nothing\r\nelse, they reminded me of the Troitzkaia Lavra near Moscow, which is\r\nalso quite a small city.\r\n\r\nThe Mongols flock to Llama Miao to sell their horses, cattle, wool,\r\nand raw hides to the Chinese, who, in return, supply them with corn\r\nof all kinds, and such simple manufactured necessaries as the Mongols\r\nrequire for their camps, at between three and four times Peking prices.\r\nA measure of corn, which costs 100 cash in Peking, costs 3½ times that\r\namount here. This trade, for the landlord says there is no other, has\r\nbeen sufficiently attractive to convert Llama Miao into a town, 6 li\r\n(2 miles) long by 4 li (1⅓ mile) broad, and densely peopled. We passed\r\na dreary day, shivering in our fur coats. We saw no good horses for\r\nsale, but one fine little gray pony, private property, was brought to\r\na farrier’s opposite, and bled in the street. I have since heard that\r\nthere is a great business done in bronze idols.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          _9th May._\r\n\r\nWe had a better chance of seeing the town and horse-fair as we rode\r\nthrough to-day. Yesterday the rain had made business dull, but to-day\r\nthere were hundreds of little horses for sale; their owners were\r\nleading them about, strung together in packs, or galloping them madly\r\nabout, to show off their paces, to the great danger of the mob, and\r\nespecially of the small boys, who were scattered from under one horse’s\r\nfeet to another’s, but always escaped by a miracle. The show was bad\r\nin quality, for the best horses are not brought in until the summer or\r\nautumn. Our horses, from their superior grooming and feeding, were much\r\nadmired, but our saddlery received an ovation. “Ai ya!” said an old\r\nChinese horse-dealer, passing a dirty thumb over my saddle, “a man may\r\ngrow old in these parts over the border, and never see such a saddle as\r\nthat! Unsurpassable!” Besides the horsey gentlemen, there is a large\r\npopulation of craftsmen, such as ropemakers, basketmakers, shoemakers,\r\nand the like. With the exception of a few large well-built places of\r\nbusiness, which have even some pretension to ornamental architecture,\r\nthe houses are small and poor. Altogether, Llama Miao is not a place\r\nworth a visit on its own account; we merely took it as a good point to\r\nreach and turn back from. If it had not been for the fact that we were\r\nriding back to Peking, I should not have been sorry to leave it.\r\n\r\nWe stopped at a small roadside inn for breakfast. The people were\r\nsuch a contrast to the town-folk, who are always impertinent and\r\nobstructive. The villagers are simple creatures, and so civil and\r\nobliging. Sitting on a bench outside the inn was a very small boy,\r\ndirty to a degree, but excessively pretty, feeding his younger brother\r\nof three years old with a sort of macaroni, which he was stuffing down\r\nhis throat with chop-sticks; the father, a good-humoured countryman,\r\nwas sitting hard by, resting and smoking his pipe. I gave the little\r\nfellow a sixpence, which he so sweetly made over to the younger child.\r\nAs I sat chatting with these people up rode a well-dressed Chinese,\r\nfollowed by his servant also on horseback. He stopped, called for a cup\r\nof tea, drank it, and went off without paying. I saw that my friends\r\nloved him as a mouse does a cat, and asked who he was. He turned out\r\nto be a customs officer. “A terrible fellow,” said one; “if travellers\r\ndon’t bribe him, he stops them, and takes their luggage, swearing that\r\nthey are smuggling.” The respect which the Chinese have for their\r\nrulers is truly touching. Our charioteer made me promise to-day to give\r\nhim a pass from the Legation when we reach Peking, without which, and\r\nperhaps in spite of which, he, being a countryman, would be mulcted at\r\nthe gate on his return home.\r\n\r\nAbout twenty miles from Llama Miao, at a place called Shui-Hsien-Tszŭ,\r\nthe sandy plain ends, and the character of the scenery changes\r\ncompletely.\r\n\r\nThe road winds down a steep ravine between hills and rocks of every\r\nvariety of shape; a tiny torrent follows the same line. There are a few\r\ntrees, leafless as yet, and here and there the lower hills are tilled.\r\nCottages are plentiful, and the number of travellers shows that we are\r\non the high-road to Peking. We passed the night at Kou Mên Tzŭ. The\r\npeople were as civil as possible, but very inquisitive, examining all\r\nour belongings with childish curiosity. They were above all delighted\r\nwith my field-glass, through which they begged to be allowed to look.\r\nThey took the greatest care of it, and if any one was too eager the\r\nothers shouted, “Don’t snatch, don’t snatch.” It was given back to\r\nme by the elder of the party, who said with the greatest gravity,\r\n“Venerable teacher, you have opened our eyes,” and then proceeded to\r\nlecture upon us for the benefit of a party of new-comers. “What are\r\nyou come to sell?” said one, interrupting the lecture. “Sell things!”\r\nshouted my exhibitor indignantly; “what thing are you? He don’t sell\r\nthings; he’s an officer like our chih hsien!”—which office is promotion\r\nfor a brass-buttoned mandarin of a rank about equal to a parish beadle.\r\nPopular enthusiasm reached its height when I pulled out an old number\r\nof the _Saturday Review_ and began to read. I can now realise the\r\nfeelings of a giant in a caravan, travelling from place to place and\r\nbeing shown wherever he goes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                         _10th May._\r\n\r\nBelow Kou Mên Tzŭ runs a mountain stream, over which there is a rude\r\nbridge supported on fascines filled with rubbish and loose stones. The\r\nvillage, from the left bank of the river, looks very picturesque,\r\nand there is a temple on the hillside that is a little gem in its\r\nway. After ascending the river for some little distance we dived into\r\nanother mountain gorge, more beautiful and wild than that of yesterday.\r\nThe rocks are bolder and more striking, and the hillsides are covered\r\nwith a dwarf wild fruit tree bearing a pink flower as brilliant as the\r\nwild rhododendron of the Alps. There are a few tender shoots, too,\r\non the stunted trees and shrubs, which, with the mosses and lichens\r\ncovering the different strata of rocks, add colour to the landscape.\r\nAs the road is a perpetual zigzag one is constantly coming upon fresh\r\nsurprises and new forms. To-day’s ride would have been perfect had it\r\nnot been for a storm of wind and sand which destroyed our pleasure. We\r\nrested at Hung Tu̔ng Tien, and our abode for the night was at Lao Wo\r\nPu̔, a quiet little place, where the inn, which stands at a turn of\r\nthe road, is perfectly circled by hills, as if it were in a devil’s\r\npunch-bowl. As we sat in the pretty inn-yard we agreed that in spite\r\nof bad weather and cold (we had found ice in several places) we had\r\nseldom enjoyed a day more. One advantage gained over our previous days\r\nwas that by loitering on the way and stopping to “sit a sit and rest\r\na rest” in different cottages, where we were always made welcome, we\r\nmanaged to arrive at the inn after our servants instead of before. It\r\nis such a bore having to look after the cleaning of the rooms and the\r\nstabling of the horses in the midst of a gaping crowd of wonderers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                         _11th May._\r\n\r\nDescending the pass the valley widens; the mountain streamlet becomes\r\nquite a river, which we have to cross over and over again; it is very\r\nrapid, and at the fords the water reaches to the horses’ girths. The\r\nground here is carefully tilled, and well irrigated as it is, must\r\nbe fertile. I saw a jolly old couple cultivating their little field\r\ntogether: the old man was painfully working out furrows with a hoe,\r\nwhile his wife, stumping along on her small feet, sowed the seed out\r\nof a wooden vessel, with a spout like a watering-pot, which she tapped\r\nwith a stick to let the grain fall out by degrees. I hope they may have\r\na good harvest. Our two resting-places were Kwa Ti Erh and Kwo Chia\r\nTu̔n, a large village with particularly disagreeable inhabitants,\r\nwhose practice it is to eat much garlic and then breathe in the face of\r\ntravellers. The sand-storm this afternoon was one of the worst I have\r\nseen. It blinded us and threw a yellow pea-soup fog over scenery that\r\nis as beautiful as mountains and river can make it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                         _12th May._\r\n\r\nWe were warned last night to be on our guard and look out for brigands,\r\nbut nothing came of it. This morning we turned off into another pass\r\nsteering south-west. Here we had a change in the landscape, for the\r\nhills were covered with trees and brushwood, showing more green as we\r\ngot farther south. The people cried wolf again about robbers, but they\r\ndo not seem to fancy attacking Europeans; the bore of it is that we\r\nare bound to do escort duty and stick to the cart, which would not be\r\nsafe without us and our revolvers. The Chinese are in mortal terror\r\nof them, so a bumbailiff from the Chih-hsien’s yamên at Fêng Ming\r\nHsien begged us to let him travel with us for company and protection.\r\nHe had been all the way to Kou Mên Tzŭ on foot to claim a debt of\r\nsix taels (£2). He told me he was between fifty and sixty years old,\r\nand had been a confirmed opium-smoker for twenty years and more,\r\nsmoking regularly twice a day, once after each meal. He was as hale\r\nand hearty as need be, walking his thirty miles a day with a heavy\r\npack on his back, for, with an eye to the main chance, he was going to\r\ncombine with his official business a little peddling trade on his own\r\naccount—a fresh proof that opium if not taken in large quantities is\r\nnot so enervating after all. As for its effect on the mind, some of the\r\ncleverest Chinese are habitual smokers. I must say that I have never\r\nseen anything which bears the faintest resemblance to the horrors of\r\nopium-smoking described in books. This man told me that opium still\r\ngave him delicious dreams, but said he regretfully, “It’s all folly,\r\nthey never come true.” Our first fifteen miles lay along very broken\r\nground—terrible work for the horses—but so picturesque, that if any\r\nbrigands had appeared I should have expected them to come out decked\r\nin ribands and tall hats like Mr. Tupman. A common crowd of Chinese\r\nragamuffins would have been sadly out of tune. One descent that we\r\nhad to make was so abrupt that I fully expected our heavy baggage-cart\r\nto come down with a run; however, the carter showed his ingenuity,\r\nand improvised a drag with a huge log of wood which he lashed behind\r\nthe cart, fastening it to the axletree with a tourniquet; this made\r\nan effective but not very lasting break; as the wheels wore through\r\nthe wood he tightened the tourniquet, and so brought the cart safe to\r\nthe bottom. From the top of the pass we had a magnificent panorama of\r\nmountains, range rising above range, north and south, in huge fantastic\r\nmasses, with dark foreground and melting blue distances. Beneath us\r\nto the south lay a little hill-girt valley green with young wheat and\r\ntrees almost in full leaf, a little Eden in the wilderness. At the\r\nfarther end of this valley is a pretty hamlet called Niu Chuên Tzŭ,\r\nwhere we breakfasted in a clean, tidy inn. We had now travelled over\r\na hundred miles through narrow mountain passes, but soon after we had\r\nleft Niu Chuên Tzŭ our road opened out into a valley so broad as to\r\nbe almost a plain. The sun was setting and lighting up the mountains\r\nthat separated us from China as we rode into Fêng Ming Hsien, a\r\npleasant town to look at, but to us very inhospitable; the best inns\r\nrejected us, and we were so mobbed and persecuted after we had found a\r\nresting-place, that I was obliged to appeal to the executive to get the\r\ninn-yard cleared. The executive made its appearance in the shape of a\r\nlarge and very dirty gentleman with an unkept tail, who by dint of a\r\ndeal of threatening and bad language procured for us peace and quiet.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                         _13th May._\r\n\r\nOf course, because our inn was particularly dirty and bad, the\r\ninnkeeper was proportionately extortionate. He was evidently a bad\r\ncharacter and rather fallen in the world, and had taken us in, in spite\r\nof prejudices which he shared with the rest of his fellow-townsmen,\r\nin order to make a profit out of us. We were glad to be quit of him,\r\nthe inn, and the town. Our mid-day halt was at a very different sort\r\nof place, a little village called Shou Hu Ying, which takes its name\r\nfrom a tradition that the famous Emperor, Káng Hsi, once came here\r\na-hunting, and killed a tiger on the spot where the village now\r\nstands. There was only one inn, humble enough, but very clean, and a\r\nfew pots of flowers in the principal room gave it an air of smartness.\r\nThe guest-room also served as village school, of which all the\r\nparaphernalia were scattered about. There was the magisterial chair and\r\nscholars’ stools covered with bits of felt or sheep-skin,—more luxury\r\nthan we had at Eton,—well-thumbed copies of the San-tzŭ-ching,—three\r\ncharacter classic,—the Chinese boy’s primer, a few cheap\r\nwriting-materials, and a copy-book in which some little urchin had been\r\nmaking laborious attempts at copying the numerals and other simple\r\ncharacters. By way of ornament there was a picture of four little boys\r\nrepresenting the seasons, dancing round a basket of impossible flowers\r\nwith the most grotesque contortions, with the superscription, “The\r\nfour seasons when prosperous beget riches.” In the cause of letters it\r\nwas satisfactory to know that we were not interrupting studies, for\r\nthe dominie had given himself and the boys a holiday, and had betaken\r\nhimself to a fair at the neighbouring village of Po Li Nao, in order to\r\ngo to the theatre. It is very funny to hear a class of little fellows\r\ndroning out the classics, of which they don’t understand a word,\r\nin chorus, the tones of the language making a sort of cadence. The\r\nsystem of teaching a boy a lot of characters without their sense, each\r\ncharacter simply representing a meaningless sound to him, could only\r\nexist in China. We passed Po Li Nao, some fifteen li farther on, and to\r\nthe great astonishment of the sightseers did not stop to hear a play by\r\na troupe of poor strollers. “What! been to Po Li Nao and didn’t go to\r\nsee the theatre! Ai ya! that’s strange!” said a footpad of whom I asked\r\nthe way. At any rate we saw what was better, Po Li Nao itself, one of\r\nthe most picturesquely situated little places I have seen in China. It\r\nstands at the foot of a bend of low hills, above which rises a towering\r\nrange of dark, jagged peaks, and beside it winds a clear pebbly stream,\r\nbreaking here and there against large stones; add to this a few quaint\r\nChinese buildings, plenty of trees, and all the bustle of the fair. We\r\nhad a difficult sandy track again for the heavy cart; we were 13½ hours\r\non the road, stopped two hours at noon, and only accomplished about\r\nthirty miles. We put up at Kwa Yo Erh, where, as at all small places,\r\nthe people were civility itself, our landlord even turning his family\r\nout of his own house in order to lodge us comfortably.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                         _14th May._\r\n\r\nWe took care that our host, who combined the profession of military\r\nofficer with that of innkeeper, should not lose by his civility, and\r\nwe parted with mutual expressions of goodwill. We had a climb of it up\r\na steepish hill, on the top of which is a temple to the god of war,\r\nand then descended on to the valley of Ku Pei Ko̔u by a winding road\r\ncut in stages over a precipice such as one finds on a large scale in\r\nSwitzerland and the Tyrol. More than once on our journey through these\r\nmountains I have been put in mind of the Alps, not only by the scenery\r\nwhich, if it were not for the absence of snow and glaciers, would stand\r\nthe comparison well, but also by the goitres and cretinism which seem\r\nto be the curse of mountainous districts. The other day at a cross-road\r\nI asked the way of a man who was collecting dung for fuel; he turned\r\nround and said very simply, “I know nothing, I’m only an idiot; ask\r\nhim,” pointing to a man ploughing, “he knows everything.” Deafness,\r\ntoo, seems rather common, probably owing to the very hard weather which\r\nprevails during some seven months of the year. The old people seem\r\nhearty enough, barring their hearing. I came across none of a very\r\nadvanced age, but one old fellow of seventy-nine was very hearty, and\r\nto all appearance likely to remain so, but he was by many years the\r\n_doyen_ of all I met, and anything past seventy seems to be looked upon\r\nas extraordinary.\r\n\r\nWe had a scorching ride to-day: there was a good deal of electricity in\r\nthe air, which told upon us when we had been some hours in the saddle.\r\nAs we were a full hour ahead of our baggage we turned the horses to\r\ngraze, and sat down by a brook to smoke a cigar. As luck would have\r\nit we had no matches; however, there was a house not far off, so the\r\ndoctor volunteered to go and beg a light. On arriving at the cottage\r\nhe found forty or fifty people engaged in a “white affair,” which is\r\nthe euphemism for a funeral, because white is the colour of mourning. A\r\ndozen or so of the relations, friends, and neighbours were seated round\r\na bier weeping and crooning officially, while the others, waiting\r\ntill their turn came for grief, were smoking their pipes and retailing\r\ncountry gossip. They were very civil, and presently—for apparently the\r\nattraction of seeing the foreigners was superior to that of mourning\r\nby commission for a poor old woman—all, except those actually on duty\r\nround the coffin, were crowding about us as merry as possible; even\r\nthe women with their heads bound up in white cloth as if they had\r\nthe face-ache turned out to have a peep at us from behind the house,\r\ngrinning and giggling as if they were assisting at a marriage.\r\n\r\nWe did not go into the town of Ku Pei Ko̔u, but stopped at an inn just\r\noutside the gates; so we had all the advantage of the fine view over\r\nthe Great Wall of China, with pure air to breathe, instead of the\r\ngarlic and muck-stained atmosphere of the town.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of our journey from Llama Miao to Ku Pei Ko̔u we did\r\nnot see a single Mongol, much less a camp. The ground is not suited\r\nto their nomad and pastoral habits; it is colonised exclusively by\r\nChinese, principally farmers from the province of Shantung. Europeans\r\nhave very rarely followed this route; so far as I can make out they\r\nhave been seen here once, or at most twice.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                         _15th May._\r\n\r\nThis day week we were shivering in furs at Llama Miao. To-day a gauze\r\nshirt was too much; the flies were a perfect pest. It was too hot to\r\ndo anything but sleep, which they put out of the question. It was not\r\nuntil after dinner that we could venture out. We went up a hill behind\r\nthe inn, from which we had a fine view of the sun setting behind the\r\nheights which the Great Wall scales. In the valley beneath wayfarers\r\nwere hurrying to reach the town before the closing of the gates;\r\nthe rear was brought up by a herd of about a hundred pigs, the last\r\ntravellers who entered China this night by the gates of Ku Pei Ko̔u.\r\n\r\nAbout Ku Pei Ko̔u and the road back to Peking I wrote to you last year,\r\nand this letter is too long already. Three days brought us home to the\r\nLegation.\r\n\r\n_P.S._—By the bye, although the part of Mongolia we visited is set down\r\non the maps as belonging to the province of Chi Li, which it is so far\r\nas its government is concerned, I have spoken of _China_ as bounded by\r\nthe Great Wall. No Mongol living beyond it would consider himself as\r\nan inhabitant of China, and the Chinese themselves speak of the places\r\nwhich are “Ko̔u-wai,” outside the mouth or frontier, as Mongolia. In\r\nStamford’s large map of China and Japan you will see how Chang Chia\r\nKo̔u, Dolonor or Llama Miao, and Ku Pei Ko̔u are placed—some of our\r\nother halting-places are also given, but you would hardly recognise\r\nthem from their spelling.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May 20th—Sunday._—Went round some of the curiosity shops, where I was\r\nshown, among other things, a wonderful ewer and cover of rock crystal,\r\nabout a foot high. I have seen nothing finer of its kind than the\r\ncarving. In the days of Chien Lung the Magnificent, himself a great\r\npatron of art, when a fine piece of rock crystal, jade, or cornelian\r\nwas brought in from the western mountains as tribute, a committee of\r\ntaste decided the shape to be given to it, and fixed upon the artist to\r\nwhom it should be entrusted by Imperial Command.\r\n\r\n_May 21._—The pious Chinese are all off these days making a pilgrimage\r\nto a holy shrine among the hills, called Miao Fêng Shan, to burn\r\njoss-stick as a sovereign prophylactic against disease and misfortune\r\nof all kinds.\r\n\r\n_May 22._—The thermometer standing at 100° in the shade. The heat\r\nfrightfully oppressive. Happily on the following day there came a great\r\nthunderstorm, with hailstones as big as pigeon’s eggs. This cooled\r\nthe air. The formation of the hailstones was curious: a nodule of ice\r\nsurrounded by a coating of frozen snow, which in its turn was encased\r\nin ice. Bad for heads!\r\n\r\n_May 27._—An outbreak of the “Heavenly Flowers,” or smallpox, causes\r\ngeneral consternation and vaccination. Any one who is opposed to\r\nvaccination had better see the ravages of this horrible disease in\r\nan Eastern city; so common is it that no Chinaman who has not “put\r\nforth the heavenly flowers” is considered quite complete. It is like\r\ndistemper with dogs in Europe.\r\n\r\n_May 29._—Dined with Dr. and Mrs. Wells Williams at the American\r\nLegation, a handsome and delightful couple now entering middle age.\r\nDr. Williams, the author of a Chinese dictionary, and that most\r\nencyclopædic book _The Middle Kingdom_, is one of the most learned\r\nof sinologues. He began his career in China as a missionary in the\r\nsouth, but his great talents rendered him necessary to the American\r\nGovernment, and he is now _chargé d’affaires_ here. He was very\r\ninteresting, talking, among other subjects, on the paper currency.\r\nBank-notes, it seems, were first introduced in the days of the Sung\r\ndynasty, during the reign of Shao Hsing (A.D. 1170). At that time\r\ncopper was scarce, so the Government issued great notes (Ta Chao) of\r\nthe value of 1000 to 5000 copper cash, and small notes (Hsiao Chao)\r\nworth from 100 to 700 cash. Officers were appointed everywhere to issue\r\nand receive these notes. They were to be renewed within seven years,\r\nand fifteen cash in every thousand were deducted for the expense of\r\nmaking them. They were said to be “kung ssŭ pien,” “convenient both for\r\nthe public and for private individuals.” Marco Polo mentions them with\r\npraise.\r\n\r\n_June 1._—My new colleague, Sir Eric Farquhar, arrived from England.\r\nAn old schoolfellow. He was accompanied by Mr. Brenchley, a most\r\naccomplished traveller, who seems to have been all over the world, and\r\nbeing a great naturalist and profound observer, is a charming companion\r\nto boot.\r\n\r\n_June 10._—The last few days have been occupied in showing Brenchley\r\nthe lions of Peking. To-day we went to breakfast at a fashionable\r\nChinese restaurant, “The House of Eternal Prosperity,” in the Ta Shih\r\nLa Erh, which we call Curio Street. In order that we might make a\r\ngenteel appearance and observe the ten thousand proprieties, my servant\r\nChang Hsi insisted on our going in carts. Walking is so vulgar! We were\r\njolted and bruised over the indescribable ruts and paving-stones to a\r\nhorrible degree, but our dignity was kept up. We found the House of\r\nEternal Prosperity very shabby and dirty, and we should have had a much\r\nbetter breakfast at home.\r\n\r\n_June 15–20._—Two more parties of travellers arrived. More work as\r\n“intelligent guide.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              LETTER XXVII\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                TA-CHIO-SSŬ,\r\n                                         THE TEMPLE OF GREAT REPOSE,\r\n                                             _23rd July 1866_.\r\n\r\nThe last mail took you no letter from me because I was far away in\r\nMongolia. My first intention had been merely to go as far as Chang\r\nChia Ko̔u, to accompany Brenchley and make the arrangements for his\r\njourney across Siberia to Russia. Ultimately, however, the party\r\nincreased to four, of whom one was a lady, and our programme grew in\r\nproportion. We started on June the 21st. We were detained four or five\r\ndays at Chang Chia Ko̔u, owing to the chicanery of a faithless Mongol\r\ncamel-owner who did not keep faith with us. However, it is a bright,\r\ncheerful little town, so I did not much mind. It was gayer than ever\r\ntoo, for on account of the great drought, morning, noon, and night,\r\nthe town was being paraded by processions of distressed agriculturists\r\npraying for rain. Preceded by squeaky clarionets, drums, and gongs,\r\na crowd of men and boys with wreaths of willow round their heads and\r\nmiddles, above which their sunburnt bodies were naked, some wearing\r\nfillets of red paper, others doing penance with their necks enclosed\r\nin the heavy board used as a punishment for prisoners, escorted a\r\nsedan chair with a tiny god in it to the Lung Wang Miao, the Temple of\r\nthe Dragon Prince, whom, being a water-god, it is well to propitiate\r\nin cases of drought.[16] Some of the votaries were armed with spears\r\nand rude guns, which from time to time they fired off, and altogether\r\nthere was din and clatter enough even to please a Chinese crowd. “Ah!\r\nthese agriculturists!” said a Chinese gentleman who was looking on\r\nwith the most supreme contempt, and whom I asked for an explanation\r\nof the affair; “they are never content! It’s always too much rain or\r\ntoo little, or something the matter. Unsurpassable!” The prayers of\r\nthe worthy people were heard, however, and the Dragon Prince took a\r\nfavourable view of their case, for the first day of my stay at Chang\r\nChia Ko̔u there came a thunderstorm, with a downfall of rain, such as\r\none seldom sees out of the tropics, and there was more or less rain all\r\nthe time we were there. The coincidence will not improve the chances\r\nof an American missionary who has been physicking the natives of Chang\r\nChia Ko̔u for rather more than a year, but in spite of the drastic\r\narguments of blue pill and black dose, has not yet made a convert.\r\n\r\nThere are three main passes leading from China into Mongolia, Chang\r\nChia Ko̔u, Ku Pei Ko̔u, and between them Tu Shih Ko̔u, which is\r\nsmaller and less important, but which I had not seen. The plan which I\r\nproposed, and which my companions accepted, was to make a tour of the\r\nthree, following a line outside, but in some parts parallel with the\r\nGreat Wall.\r\n\r\nWe left Chang Chia Ko̔u on the 30th of June. It was frightfully hot,\r\nbut I had provided a refuge against the scorching sun, which at\r\nmid-day would have been unbearable. We each had with us a mule litter,\r\na sort of long carriage in which a single person can almost lie at full\r\nlength, with shafts behind and before which are borne on mules’ backs.\r\nThis sounds rather a comfortable and luxurious way of travelling,\r\nseeing that one’s bed and pillows are placed inside. As a fact it is\r\nhorridly jolty and sea-sicky; then no sooner has one established one’s\r\nself in a tolerably easy position and dozed off (which is inevitable,\r\nand makes one very hot and uncomfortable), than one is called upon by\r\nthe muleteer to trim the boat: “Your Excellency! please sit a little\r\nmore to the south. Your Excellency’s weight is all to the north!\r\nThe north side of that mule’s back is becoming terribly galled.” My\r\nmuleteer was a very original character. He had a prodigious talent for\r\nscreaming out Chinese anacreontics at the top of his voice, and for\r\ndramatic recitations and imitations of popular actors. He was always\r\nthe last of the muleteers to get up in the morning, and when at last I\r\ntook to waking him with the crack of a hunting-whip, he only grumbled\r\ngood-humouredly and said the “old lord,” meaning me, was very hard\r\nupon him, but none the more did he get up to feed his mules. He had\r\nbeen to Mongolia once with Sir Frederic Bruce, to whom he applied the\r\nmost glowing eulogy that a Chinaman can bestow, holding up his thumb;\r\nwords could go no further. Altogether Cha Mai Chu—that is his name—was\r\nthe merriest, grinningest, and most laughable devil that I have ever\r\ncome across here. When we arrived at the inn, and the six muleteers,\r\nhaving acquiesced in the landlord’s civil proposal, “You six gentlemen”\r\n(if you could but see the six gentlemen!) “will dine together, I\r\nsuppose,” had sat down to the coarse fare, a sort of macaroni with\r\ngarlic and pickles, which they allow themselves, Cha Mai Chu used to\r\nkeep the other five in a roar of laughter, and I rather think that\r\nby that means he contrived to suck up the lion’s share of the white\r\nstrings.\r\n\r\nAs the first part of our road, as far as Chang-Ma-Tzŭ-Chin, was but\r\na repetition of the same journey which I wrote about in my last\r\nlong letter describing my expedition to Llama Miao, I spare you the\r\nrepetition. Farther on we followed a route new to me, and in some\r\nplaces not visited before by foreigners. This may interest you. After\r\nleaving Chang-Ma-Tzŭ-Chin on the 3rd July, instead of pushing on\r\nnorthwards across Mongolia, which at this season is far more worthy\r\nof its Chinese name, “The Land of Grass,” than it was two months\r\nago, we steered south-east back towards China, across a sandy plain,\r\nrichly cultivated with potatoes and other crops. In the midst of this\r\nsandy tract stands a little tumble-down Chinese village called Lien\r\nHwa Tan, “the lotus-flower fountain,” from an old tradition that\r\nthere once stood there a temple in which was a fountain flourishing\r\nwith lotus-flowers. Now it is a case of _lucus a non_, for temple,\r\nfountain, and flowers have all faded away together, and as for anything\r\nflourishing, there was barely a roof for us to eat our breakfasts\r\nunder. We were making for a ridge of green hills, from the top of which\r\nI expected to come in sight of the Great Wall, which, however, did not\r\nappear until we had reached the bottom of an emerald-green valley,\r\nwith luxuriant vegetation, lying between rugged and bare rocks. Hard\r\nby Tu Shih Ko̔u the great brick monster showed itself again, but in\r\nruins, undermined and sapped by continual watercourses. The rocks here\r\nare very fine, picturesque and astonishing in their shapes. Tu Shih\r\nKo̔u itself is a queer little old town. The fortifications and walls\r\nare falling into decay, uncared for and unrepaired. In a few years, I\r\nshould think, its quaint gables and towers and useless fortifications\r\nwill have crumbled away; but on the other hand, inside the walls there\r\nare shops, neat and tidy, and houses showing signs of some prosperity.\r\nPerhaps, after all, there is some method in the apparent madness of\r\nletting the old remains of protection against border warfare go to\r\nthe dogs. I have often told you how bothered travellers are here on\r\narriving at an inn by gapers and starers. The nuisance was multiplied\r\na hundred-fold on this excursion by the fact of our having a lady\r\nwith us. I was armed with special letters of recommendation from the\r\nMinisters of Foreign Affairs to the high mandarins along the road, and\r\nas soon as these last heard that we were annoyed, they hastened to send\r\nus “po-po” (sweetmeats) and protection, but before this arrived I had\r\nbeen obliged to take the law into my own hands, for three dirty, old,\r\ngray blackguards had actually, using their wet thumbs as centre-bits,\r\nmade holes in one of our paper windows, at which they were playing\r\npeeping Tom, and so interested by what they saw that they did not\r\nhear Retribution stealing up on tiptoe armed with a hunting-whip.\r\nRetribution, that is myself, tied their three nasty old tails together\r\nand packed them off howling, to the great delight of their friends and\r\nrelations, who quite recognised the breach of Tao Li of which they had\r\nbeen guilty. An appeal to Tao Li, good manners, or propriety, is always\r\na trump card to play when in difficulties with a Chinese crowd.\r\n\r\nWe only stayed one night at Tu Shih Ko̔u, and then rode back through\r\nanother pass to the fresh air of the steppe. We passed the night at\r\na little hamlet called Chang Leang. There was but one inn, and that\r\nwas full, and we should have had to pass the night _al fresco_ if a\r\ngood-natured Bachelor of Arts returning from Llama Miao to Tu Shih Ko̔u\r\nhad not consented to push on and give us up his room for the lady of\r\nour party. The rest of us managed to huddle up somehow. Never in all my\r\nwanderings here have I had to sleep in such queer places as I did on\r\nthis journey. The villages were poor, the inns worse; and instead of\r\nhaving the high place, we males were bound to put up with holes such\r\nas the very beggars in England would back out of. However, the game was\r\nworth the candle so far as scenery was concerned, and then the air of\r\nMongolia makes up for everything. Even the Alpine Club do not know what\r\nfresh air is; they must come to the steppes.\r\n\r\nThe next day we breakfasted at a felt manufactory, at a village called\r\nTa Tan. The way the Chinese make their felt is very rude and primitive,\r\nbut the result beats Manchester and cogwheels. A quantity of wool\r\nis carded and weighed and scattered evenly over a rush mat. When a\r\nsufficient quantity has been laid, the wool is carefully flattened\r\ndown with a sort of wickerwork fan and sprinkled with boiling water;\r\nthe mat and wool are then rolled up and tied, and the roll being laid\r\non the ground is kicked backwards and forwards by six men from foot\r\nto foot for five minutes. A second layer completes the felt, which is\r\nexcellent. I wish I could give you an idea of the extreme beauty of\r\nour afternoon’s ride. After we had left our felt manufactory, the road\r\nlay through low hills, along a valley that was perfectly enamelled\r\nwith wild-flowers, principally yellow ones, a real blaze of gold—wild\r\nroses, ranunculus, amaryllis, peony, daphne, potentilla, pinks, purple\r\niris, gorgeous tiger and Turk’s cap lilies, and poppies which pay the\r\nEmperor of China the compliment of wearing his colours, besides a host\r\nof others—a mass of beauties. A violent contrast to the richness of the\r\npasture are the herds of camels, who at this time of year, coatless,\r\nmangy, emaciated, and so weak as hardly to be able to move along, are\r\nturned out to get rid of the sores on their backs and recruit for\r\ntheir hard work in autumn, winter, and spring. Poor brutes! pitiable\r\nas they look, this must be the happiest season of their year; they\r\nwell earn their rest. Along this wild garden we gradually ascended—so\r\ngradually that it was not until we had reached the top of the pass\r\nthat opens out between two rocks on a panorama of high hills, range\r\nupon range lying at our feet, that we had any idea how high we were.\r\nI think this view as I saw it, with the sun setting in the distance\r\nand the remains of a storm rolling away over the mountains, is one\r\nof the finest I have ever seen. The mountains themselves are savage\r\nand barren, and in the valleys clusters of trees mark where Chinese\r\nhomesteads stand, so poor that not even eggs are to be bought there.\r\nIn one of these, at a place called Pa Ti, half farmhouse, half inn, we\r\nslept, I in a sort of barn, my bed on the ground, my dressing-table a\r\nnether millstone, and my washhand-stand the carcase of an old cart. The\r\nsun was rising when we started down the valley, which really is the\r\ngrandest thing I have seen in China, and barring the attractions of\r\nsnow and ice, it seems to me the Alps have nothing finer to show. Rocks\r\nmore grim and uncouth there cannot be. They take every conceivable\r\nshape—men’s heads, tigers, lions, citadels with turrets and battlements\r\nof living rock, are easily conjured up. Then there are huge boulders\r\nthat look as if a breath would blow them down, so delicately are they\r\npoised upon points apparently quite unfit to bear their weight. It is\r\na valley which makes one think of old fairy tales about giants and\r\ndwarfs and ogres’ castles. The poor commonplace Chinese drudges who\r\ninhabit it are ill-suited to their home. The best part of the scenery\r\nends some fifteen miles down the valley, at a hill called Llama Shan\r\n(“The Llama’s Hills”)—two enormous pyramidical rocks, at the foot of\r\nwhich is a village to which they give their name. On one rock, high\r\nupon a flat surface hard to climb to, is painted a rude picture of\r\nBuddha, with a glory round his head and his finger and thumb held up\r\nin orthodox form. The painting is of old date, but pious hands have\r\nrecently restored it. In the other rock is a cave in which a rather\r\nhazy tradition says that in old times a llama or llamas used to retire\r\nfrom the world, and pass their time in the pious contemplation of their\r\nown navels. Their reverences showed their taste in the choice of their\r\nabode, for it is a lovely spot. We were spoilt for the lower half of\r\nthe valley by the beauty of the upper half, but we had still before us\r\na fine jagged hill, at the foot of which is Ta Kao, our halting-place,\r\na largish town, rich in gardens. And what would Exeter Hall say if it\r\nheard that there are places in these parts which actually cultivate\r\ntheir own poppies? We found a famous inn at Ta Kao, with large rooms\r\nfreshly papered; but strange to say, on the 6th of July, the stove-beds\r\nor kangs were all heated. We, coming from the cool mountain breezes,\r\nfound the atmosphere of itself close and stuffy, though in comparison\r\nwith Peking it was freshness itself; the heated kangs were perfectly\r\ninsupportable. We wound up a long day with the usual exhibition to a\r\nrather tiresome crowd.\r\n\r\nWe travelled next day along a poverty-stricken but picturesque valley,\r\nthrough which flows a mountain torrent swelled almost to a river by\r\nthe recent rains. We had to ford it twenty-two times in the course\r\nof the day. At one ford one of the mule litters broke down and was\r\nsmashed to pieces. No great damage was done, and the mule litter was\r\npatched together with bits of string and an old nail or two. The way\r\nin which the muleteer abused his beasts for the mishap was very funny.\r\nTreating the mule as if it had been a human creature, he proceeded\r\nin his wrath to take away its younger sister’s character. Be it man\r\nor mule, horse or pig, or what not, that sins against a Chinese, he\r\nimmediately tramples on the fair fame of the younger sister of the\r\noffender, heaping upon her every foul abuse that he can lay his tongue\r\nto. Mingled with his revilings, the muleteer addressed the most humble\r\npetitions to me not to dock his pay, passing from prayer to abuse with\r\nwondrous facility. If that mule’s younger sister was guilty of one-half\r\nthe enormities ascribed to her, the punishment has not yet been devised\r\nwhich would be equal to the occasion. The list of her crimes is not\r\nfit for publication. When we arrived at Chai Ling the only room that I\r\ncould have was perfectly untenable from stuffiness and a hot kang which\r\ntook up a good half of it, so I slept in my litter in the inn-yard,\r\n_sub Jove_, which was very cool and pleasant.\r\n\r\nThe following morning, 8th July, we were awakened by a most glorious\r\nsunrise; it was so fresh and nice that I walked the greater part\r\nof the day’s journey, to the undisguised wonder of the muleteers,\r\nwho could not in the least understand it. They hold up their thumbs\r\nin admiration, and loudly express their high respect for such\r\nprowess. “See the old lord! how he walks!” “He has obtained to walk\r\nunsurpassably.” “This body! Our lords here have not such bodies!”\r\nIt was but a ten-mile walk; but no Chinese gentleman would dream of\r\nattempting such a feat. We all went beetle-mad this day, one of our\r\nparty being an entomologist. Under one jujube-tree we found so many\r\nvarieties of insects of different kinds that it became perfectly\r\nexciting; even the muleteers caught the fever and began to take a\r\ncertain interest in the hunt, but were rather afraid of the quarry. At\r\nthe end of a very pretty mountain walk we found the “Inn of Flourishing\r\nRighteousness,” with a large yard full of picturesque groups of\r\nhalf-naked drovers and muleteers. We were well lodged and very\r\ncomfortable.\r\n\r\nThe next morning we came down the pass on to Ku Pei Ko̔u, which I\r\nfound as attractive as ever. I put up at my old quarters outside the\r\ntown. Of course we rested a day to let the travellers have a ramble\r\non the Great Wall. While they were busy picking up bricks and ferns\r\nand other souvenirs of the Great Wall, I fell in with a curious\r\ncharacter. He was an old Chinaman, by name Li, by trade a herbalist\r\nand naturalist, by adoption a poultry-fancier, and by inspiration a\r\nprofessor of palmistry. He began by telling me a lot of curious facts\r\nand properties about different plants and roots, but as their English\r\nnames were unknown to me I cannot repeat them. Certain of them were to\r\ncure the hot, others to repel the cold influence. Lizards he pointed\r\nto as a deadly poison (internal) to horses and cattle. After he had\r\ndiscoursed to me some time, he asked to look at my hand; and then he\r\nreally surprised me. He told me things about myself and family which\r\nare certainly known to few people but ourselves; that they should have\r\nbecome known to a poor cottager living on a hillside near a little\r\nout-of-the-way town at the farther extremity of Asia is impossible.\r\nWe shall see if what he said about the future is equally correct. The\r\nlines in the hand from which he gathered his auguries were different\r\nfrom those which used to be read in Europe; he explained his science\r\nto me, but as he did so in verse, and in the jargon of the trade, I\r\ncould not make much of it. He invited me afterwards to his cottage—such\r\na pretty little spot, with a glorious vine trained so as to make a\r\ncovered Pergola in front of it. He passes his life here contentedly,\r\nseldom going to the town but when he needs to sell his herbs or his\r\nchickens. As soon as he made his appearance with me a whole pack of\r\ndirty little brats, all stark naked, came trooping out to welcome him\r\nand salute their father’s guest according to manners.\r\n\r\nI had hoped to have pushed so far as Jo Hol, the imperial palace and\r\nhunting forest, but one of my companions struck work, and I was obliged\r\nto return to Peking, having been within two days of my goal, which I\r\nhope, however, to reach another time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             LETTER XXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\n                                     TA-CHIO-SSŬ, _4th August 1866_.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned from Mongolia three weeks ago I found that all the\r\nworld, that is to say, the three or four diplomatists who compose\r\nour world, had very wisely taken itself off to the country. So early\r\nas last February I had secured this “Temple of Great Repose,” and I\r\nlost no time in coming out here. It is too far from Peking to be very\r\nconvenient; but it is well worth the extra ride, and the advantage\r\nof being fifteen miles from the other temples inhabited by Europeans\r\nis incalculable; one is not subject to perpetual interruptions by\r\npeople who, being bored themselves, come in and inflict their boredom\r\nupon others. It is a great undertaking moving out to the hills. We\r\nare obliged to take absolutely our whole _ménage_, and almost all our\r\nfurniture with us. I think you would have laughed at my procession;\r\nthere were fourteen carts full of every kind of movable—our whole\r\npoultry-yard clucking and cackling out of coops and baskets, and a cow\r\nwith her calf. This must seem strange to you, who would certainly not\r\ndream of taking your hens, ducks, and cows with you from town to the\r\ncountry: it is only another instance of the universal topsy-turviness\r\nof things in China, again demonstrated by the fact that the farther one\r\ngets from town the dearer everything becomes, there being no market and\r\nno competition, so that the owner of a leg of mutton can just charge\r\nwhat he pleases for it, knowing that you must either buy at his price\r\nor go without it altogether. It is a beautiful ride out here, past\r\nHai Tien, a little village with a smart inn at which the Pekingese\r\nmay be seen by scores, naked to the waist, and enjoying an outing,\r\nafter their fashion, with chopsticks and rice, tea and infinitesimal\r\npipes, past Yuen Ming Yuen and Wan Shao Shan, or rather its ruins,\r\npast flourishing cornfields and picturesque hamlets, past temples and\r\nshrines innumerable, along stony roads which the rains have turned into\r\ncanals so deep that the carters are obliged to cast lots for which\r\nshall strip his very dirty body and go in to see whether the carts can\r\npass or not. It was quite dark before I reached the temple, after eight\r\nhours’ ride under the hottest sun I ever remember to have felt. Indeed\r\nI had a sad proof of its strength the next day, for my brown pony,\r\nHop-o’-my-thumb, who had carried me so well over so many hundred miles,\r\ndied of sunstroke after a few hours’ illness. Poor little beast! He was\r\na great pet, and as fond of me as a dog. When I went down to his stable\r\nshortly before he died he put his head on my shoulder and looked so\r\npiteously in my face. The Chinese veterinary surgeon (they are rather\r\nclever at that) declares that he was struck by the sun the day before\r\nwhile he was being led. He was the strongest, stoutest little beast you\r\never saw, never sick nor sorry, and used to trot into Peking after a\r\n700-mile journey as if he had just been out for a morning’s exercise.\r\nHe is the third horse that I have lost from one cause or another since\r\nlast September. Bad luck, is it not?\r\n\r\nThis is certainly the prettiest temple and the most charming summer\r\nresidence that I have seen near Peking. The temple stands in a nest\r\nof trees—cedars, pines, firs, and poplars—a perpetual fountain runs\r\nthrough all its courts, and there seems always to be a cool breeze\r\nblowing. While our friends are complaining of being roasted and baked\r\nin their temples, we here are revelling in fresh air. Here is a\r\ntranslation of an account of Ta Chio Ssŭ by a Chinese gentleman:—\r\n\r\n“Seventy li (23 miles) from the walls of Peking there stood in the\r\ntime of the Liao a temple called Ling Chuan Ssŭ, ‘The temple of the\r\nSpiritual Fountain.’ In the reign of the Emperor Hsuan Tê of the Ming\r\ndynasty it was restored, and the name changed to Ta Chio Ssŭ, ‘The\r\ntemple of Great Repose.’ There are four shrines: the first is to the\r\nPrince of heaven; the second to Ju Lai Fo, the Buddha who reigns in the\r\nwestern heaven; the third to the Yo Shih Fo, the Buddha who presides\r\nover medicine; and the fourth and last shrine has an upper story, and\r\nin it is the Pu-sa (god of the second class) of Great Compassion.\r\nBehind the shrines is a pond with a fountain. In this is a dragon’s\r\nhead carved in stone, out of the mouth of which the spring issues. In\r\nfront of the pond is a pagoda, on the left and right hands of which\r\nare old fir-trees, one on each side, about which an old tradition\r\nsays that they never can overtop the pagoda, hence the spot is called\r\n‘Sung ta chi,’ or ‘The firs and pagoda level.’ Besides this, outside\r\nthe shrine of the Prince of heaven, on either side there is a stone\r\ncalled the dragon stone and the tiger stone, from their resemblance\r\nto those animals. In front of these there is a stone bridge with a\r\npond of water on each side, and in the ponds there are a fountain and\r\nlotus flowers and gold fish. By the side of the ponds is a dragon’s\r\nclaw tree, in the shape of lions playing, whence it is called the Lion\r\nTree. The temple is built on the west, facing the east; on its south\r\nside is an imperial residence called Ssŭ Yi Tang, ‘The Hall of the Four\r\nProprieties.’ In the hall stands an imperial throne. In the garden are\r\nfour trees—peonies and two Yu Lan Hwa trees, magnolias. Behind this\r\nhall is the ‘Pavilion of the Reposing Clouds,’ ‘Chi Yün Hsuan,’ in\r\nfront of which are bright bamboos and dark green firs interlaced like\r\na forest, a capital refuge from the heat in midsummer, with plenty to\r\nsee.”\r\n\r\nMy friend Liu, who wrote the description which I have translated\r\nabove, has left out one of the greatest charms of the place. Just\r\nbehind the “Pavilion of the Reposing Clouds,” in which we live, is a\r\nmost beautiful rock work, all covered with tufts of feathery grass,\r\nmosses, and ferns, and lycopods: down this and into an artificial\r\nbasin, which is screened from the sun by a network of fir branches,\r\ncomes tumbling a deliciously cool fountain scented with pine needles,\r\nwhich gives us a famous shower-bath twice a day—a real luxury. Close\r\nby my fountain is a little summer-house, in which the Emperor Chien\r\nLung was transacting business one day with his ministers, and feeling\r\ninspired by the influence of the place got through his work greatly to\r\nhis satisfaction, so he called the summer-house “The Pavilion of the\r\nUnderstanding of Important Matters.” I wonder whether I have given you\r\nan idea of what a very pretty place this is? It is almost enough to\r\ntempt a man to turn Buddhist priest, and abstracting himself from the\r\nunrealities of this life, pass his hour on earth in reflecting upon the\r\nbeauties of the hopelessly unattainable Nirvana (I don’t suppose you\r\nknow what that is—so much the better. It will be like that “blessed\r\nword Mesopotamia” to the old woman at church). The only pity is that\r\nmosquitoes and sand-flies sound such a lively recall to the reality of\r\nthe disagreeable.\r\n\r\nThe monastery is richly endowed with lands, so much so as to be\r\nindependent of the assistance from Government, to which, as an imperial\r\ntemple, it would be entitled. The place looks richer than most of the\r\ntemples about here. There is no magnificence, but it has a comfortable,\r\nwell-to-do appearance, the grounds and buildings being properly kept\r\nup. All over the gardens there are notices to “relations and friends”\r\nwho may visit the temple to abstain from damaging buildings and trees,\r\nplucking flowers or cutting down the bamboos, a notice the spirit of\r\nwhich, as it says, “all respectable persons will observe of their own\r\naccord, and those who do not will be fined.” First and last, monks and\r\nlaymen, there are some fifty persons employed about the temple. The\r\nabbot himself finds it dull, so he remains at Peking enjoying himself.\r\nHis second in command is a charming monk, very clean in his person\r\nand especially natty about his boots. He is very intelligent, too,\r\nand comes and sits with me by the hour talking Buddhism. This is an\r\nextremely religious temple—prayers, liturgies, drum and gong beating,\r\nseem to be going on very constantly. But except on the 1st and 15th of\r\nevery moon and other holidays the novices are put on active service,\r\nthe monks enjoying an unbroken idleness; they are apparently cursed\r\nwith an unquenchable thirst, but as a fountain of perennial tea flows\r\nfor them they are not to be pitied. I suppose you would ask the name\r\nof my friend with the neat boots; this would be an arch mistake and\r\nviolation of good-breeding on your part. When a man shaves his tail\r\nand turns monk he cuts himself off from the whole world, including his\r\nfamily, whose name even he no longer bears. To remind him of this would\r\nbe quite ill-bred, but as it is inconvenient that a monk—who, however\r\nmuch he may renounce the vanities of this life, must occasionally be\r\nbrought in contact with that extremely unreal idea, the world—should\r\nhave no designation at all, he adopts two words or characters as his\r\nappellation, which on no account must you call his name. You ask him\r\nwhat is his “honourable above and below”; this refers to the two\r\ncharacters, one of which is written above the other. My friend’s\r\n“honourable above and below” is Fo Kwo. As a Buddhist monk must not be\r\nasked his name, so a Taoist monk must not be asked his age, although it\r\nis one of the complimentary routine questions in China.\r\n\r\nThe neighbourhood round about here is as charming as the place itself.\r\nThe fields are richly cultivated; there is plenty of hedge-row timber,\r\nand the villages are very picturesque and well shaded. The hills are\r\nbeautifully shaped, and take fine colours of an evening. The one\r\nthing wanting is water, which is missing all over this part of China.\r\nNothing can be prettier than the cottages of the villagers with their\r\nlong, low eaves; each has its little garden hedged in by a fence of\r\ntall millet, over which are trained gourds and other creepers. There\r\nis generally, too, a millet-straw shed with a vine creeping about it,\r\nand under this the labourers sit of an evening and drink their tea,\r\na picture of contentment. The temples, both Taoist and Buddhist, are\r\nnumerous. Yesterday I scrambled up to a very pretty one on the top of\r\na great eminence so steep that it is called by the Chinese the “Wall\r\nMountain.” I found a most charming little monastery built in tiers, I\r\nshould have said terraces had it not been so tiny, which reminded me\r\nof the tiers of the Rhenish vineyards. Their reverences the monks had\r\nall gone off to Peking on a lark, but I was hospitably entertained with\r\ntea by two lay attendants, for whose benefit I in return emptied my\r\ncigar-case. What a queer existence these people lead perched up on the\r\ntop of a high hill! They are so stay-at-home that they hardly seem to\r\ncare even to go down on to the plain. And as to going to Peking, none\r\nbut the better-to-do monks dream of such dissipation. You may imagine\r\nwhat a state of crass ignorance they live in. For faces expressing\r\nbrutal stupidity there is nothing to equal the Chinese monks, except\r\nthe Thibetan llamas, between whom and drivelling idiotcy there is no\r\nmissing link. My friend here, Fo Kwo, is a brilliant exception. Monks\r\nand laymen alike—all our neighbours—vie with one another in civility\r\nto us. They all stop one to have a chat, and as for tea, I might drown\r\nmyself in a butt of it if I had a mind. The women, however—and in one\r\nvillage there are some very pretty ones—are as _farouches_ as wild\r\ndeer. As I ride in at one end of a village I see them scuttling off\r\ninto their houses, with their babies on their backs, as fast as their\r\npoor deformed feet will let them. If by chance I overtake them, they\r\nscowl at me as if I really were the devil they call me. During the\r\nwhole time I have been in China, I do not think that I have three times\r\nbeen addressed by Chinese women; the rare exceptions have always been\r\nwrinkled old hags—of course I do not count beggars. _Ces dames_ don’t\r\nlove us. They are always the first to get up the cry of “Kwei tzŭ”\r\n(devils) against us, and I almost think that they verily believe that\r\nthere is something uncanny about us, or at any rate that there is no\r\nvillainy of which we are not capable. However, I think that last year I\r\ntold you some of their beliefs with respect to us.\r\n\r\nFarquhar joined me on the 20th July, bringing with him Dr. Pogojeff\r\nfrom the Russian summer quarters at Pa Ta Chu—a group of temples nearer\r\nPeking, where most of the Legations spend the hot season. They are\r\ndelighted with the beauty of this place. Farquhar, who is a very clever\r\nartist, has made some lovely sketches. July the 25th was the fifteenth\r\nday of the Chinese moon, a high day with our Buddhist friends. On\r\nordinary days the novices do the drum and gong beating, and intone the\r\nprayers (which indeed never seem to cease), but on the 1st and 15th of\r\neach moon the higher priests—whose everyday duties seem to be confined\r\nto smoking infinite and infinitesimal pipes of tobacco, and sipping cup\r\nafter cup of amber tea—buckle to the work themselves, leaving their\r\nease and dignity to don their black and yellow robes, and perform\r\nservice with the rest.\r\n\r\nOne day out walking we were accosted by a man who told us that he was\r\nout for a holiday, and insisted on taking us with him to a village\r\nwhere there was “Jo nao” (fun) going on. We could not resist, so we\r\nwent with him, and in a by-lane of the said village, on one of the\r\nthreshing-floors, we found a small raised stage. After we had waited\r\nsome time, during which the whole village had time to turn out for a\r\ngood stare at us, a man made his appearance with a very small drum,\r\nthree pairs of castanets, and three gongs. He was followed by three\r\nladies—one old and two young, and all hideous—and then the performance\r\nbegan with an instrumental overture by the whole strength of the\r\ncompany, a rattling and jangling which lasted five minutes, and sent us\r\noff with our fingers in our ears. We gave the poor people a dollar and\r\nwere glad to escape; but the villagers were highly delighted, for were\r\nnot these real actors come all the way from Peking, and, therefore, of\r\ncourse eminent? Mario and Grisi, starring in the provinces, never gave\r\nmore pleasure to a country audience.\r\n\r\nFrightfully hot weather. Do you remember the old quatrain written with\r\na diamond on a pane of glass in the old Foreign Office in Downing\r\nStreet:—\r\n\r\n    Je suis copiste,\r\n    Affreux métier,\r\n    Joyeux ou triste,\r\n    Toujours copier!\r\n\r\nCopying despatches with the thermometer at 100° in the shade, with\r\na basin of water and a towel at one’s side for very necessary\r\nhand-wiping, and a pad of blotting-paper over the blank part of one’s\r\npaper, is indeed an _affreux métier_.\r\n\r\nI find that Englishmen who can’t speak the language are a little\r\ncapricious as to exchanging courtesies which the Chinese press upon\r\nthem. Sometimes it amuses them immensely to stop and talk twaddle with\r\nthe natives through an interpreter, while at others, especially if\r\nthere is just a touch of headache in the case, the Chinamen get short\r\nanswers. To-day as we were walking we passed a group of peasants, one\r\nof whom as usual called out civilly, “Hsie yi hsie pa?” (Won’t you sit\r\ndown a bit?)\r\n\r\n_F._—“What the devil’s he saying?”\r\n\r\n_Chinaman_ (thinking to be intelligible by being still louder)—“Hsie yi\r\nhsie pa!”\r\n\r\n_F._—“Don’t make that damned noise!”\r\n\r\n_I._—“He’s only asking you to sit down.”\r\n\r\n_F._ (savagely)—“Well, he needn’t make such a confounded row about it!”\r\n\r\n_Chinaman_ (to his friends)—“The gentleman is not very quiet,” as if he\r\nwere speaking of a restive horse.\r\n\r\n_Friends_ (assenting)—“Ah! these foreigners! they are indeed terrible\r\npeople. Unsurpassable! unsurpassable!”\r\n\r\nThe poor villagers would have been too civil to utter their opinion if\r\nthey had thought they were understood, but I had held my tongue to hear\r\nwhat they would say.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of August we had a delightful addition to our family party\r\nin the shape of my old friend Dick Conolly, who has come out as second\r\nsecretary—the cheeriest of companions.[17]\r\n\r\nNext day he and I rode over to see a very famous temple, Hei Lung Tan,\r\na shrine dedicated to the Black Dragon, which was built in the Ming\r\ndynasty and repaired in Ka̔ng Hsi’s reign. It is an imposing edifice\r\nbuilt in three tiers with roofs of the imperial yellow tiles. Here the\r\nBlack Dragon Prince rests in great dignity. He is surrounded by six\r\nsatellites—a monster who presides over the thunder, a woman who rules\r\nthe lightning, a clerk with pen and book who writes down orders for the\r\nrainfall, and three others whose functions are not so clear. Of human\r\nattendants there was visible but one priest, very dirty and saturated\r\nwith garlic. The Black Dragon being, like all dragons in this country,\r\na water deity or spirit, there is of course a pond in which he may\r\ndisport himself. If his priest would only do the same!\r\n\r\nThe country people are really very civil and kind. The other day we\r\nwere wandering through a village nestled away among the hills, when\r\nseveral of the peasants came out and brought us delicious pears. One\r\nold gentleman, a personage evidently, was just preparing a great\r\nsacrifice outside his house to ward off the devil. He had erected an\r\naltar on which were placed various fruits and grapes, and in front of\r\nit was a great paper boat with dolls in it. This was to be burnt, and\r\nwith the letting off of many crackers would complete the sacrifice.\r\nThis, it appears, being the 15th day of the 7th moon, is the feast of\r\ndeparted spirits—a sort of All Souls’ Day. It is the anniversary on\r\nwhich the pious Chinaman worships and burns incense at the tombs of his\r\nancestors—the custom over which the Dominicans and Franciscans on the\r\none side, and the Jesuits on the other, started their great feud in the\r\ndays of the Emperor Ka̔ng Hsi.[18] There are also on this day great\r\nceremonies in honour of the tutelary saints of towns, some deceased\r\nminister or warrior appointed by the Emperor as guardian over each\r\ntown or part of a town. Great honour is paid to one of these patron\r\nsaints, and men will flock to his shrine to dedicate themselves to his\r\nservice, so that a man, for instance, who is a groom in this life,\r\nwill go and offer himself to be the saint’s groom in the next world.\r\nThe effigy of this “Lord of the Walls,” as he is called, is paraded\r\nthrough the town where he is supposed to search out evil-doers. There\r\nis also a Prince of departed spirits whose shrine is largely attended\r\non this day. A stage is raised and priests are engaged to read prayers\r\nand distribute food for the spirits, that those who have died a violent\r\ndeath may be released from Purgatory. At midnight huge paper images,\r\nplaced in a boat in order that the spirits may pass the river Nai-ho, a\r\nsort of Styx, are solemnly burnt, and the feast is over. The feast is\r\ncalled Yu Lang Hai, “The assembly of the Bowl and Flower.” My teacher\r\nexplains this, saying that on board the boat there is a Buddhist god\r\ncalled Ti Tsang Wang, who gives the ghosts of the departed a bowl and\r\nflower as a token of release from their sins, so that they may cross\r\nthe river which is a gulf between them and Paradise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              LETTER XXIX\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       PEKING, _7th September 1866_.\r\n\r\nSome time ago I was invited to go to the play by the great curio\r\nmerchant here—Han Chang-kwei-ti. As the Pekingese theatres have a great\r\ncelebrity, I ought to give you some account of them.\r\n\r\nThere are a great many theatres in the Chinese city, their situation\r\nbeing marked by a few masks, lay figures, images of tortoises or\r\ndragons, or other queer beasts; though indeed no sign is necessary to\r\nindicate their whereabouts, for the infernal din which comes from them\r\nthe whole day long would guide any one to them. The theatres are the\r\nproperty of restaurateurs, who engage a company of actors to come and\r\nplay for so many days, so that the troupes are constantly changing\r\nquarters. You go in by a long passage, which leads into a lofty and\r\nspacious hall, lighted from the top, and surrounded by a gallery.\r\nIn the pit, or body of the hall, are tables at which the people sit\r\ndrinking tea, eating sweetmeats, or with papers of fried melon and\r\ngourd seeds before them. This is the place of the poorer people; the\r\nrank and fashion go to the gallery, part of which is divided into\r\nprivate boxes. At one end of the hall is a raised platform, without\r\nscenes or appliances of any kind, open at the sides, and separated\r\nfrom the dressing-room by two doors with curtains; at the back of the\r\nstage sit the orchestra, five or six performers, all of whom play\r\nupon several instruments, which they take up in turn, according to\r\nthe character of the music. The chief instruments are fiddles, lutes,\r\nclarionets, flutes, a sort of mouth organ, and any number of variety of\r\ngongs, drums, and cymbals. I talk of fiddles, etc., for simplicity’s\r\nsake, but you know a Chinese fiddle is no more like a European fiddle\r\nthan a Chinaman with his pig-tail is like a European in a chimney-pot\r\nhat.\r\n\r\nNothing could be more rude or primitive than the state of the drama.\r\nThe tragedies are all strutting and mouthing; roaring in a bass\r\nvoice that seems to come out of the actor’s boots, or squeaking in\r\na falsetto shrill enough to set your teeth on edge. The whole of the\r\nwords are declaimed in a sort of recitative, which is more than half\r\ndrowned by the drums and gongs. The language of tragedies is the old\r\nliterary style and very obscure, and as if to make it still more\r\ndifficult to the Pekingese, the actors all affect the Soochow dialect\r\nas the mother-tongue of the stage. The consequence of this is that even\r\na well-educated Chinaman will make a very poor guess at the plot unless\r\nhe has read the tragedy beforehand. Not understanding what is going\r\non does not, however, seem to affect the enjoyment of the audience,\r\nnine-tenths of whom could no more tell you what the play is all about\r\nthan I could.\r\n\r\nAs there is no scenery or stage appliances a great deal must be\r\nsupplied by the imagination. A lady coming in with an attendant in the\r\nplain clothes of a Pekingese coolie, holding horizontally on each side\r\nof her two flags on which are painted wheels and clouds, is a fairy\r\nentering in her chariot of clouds. A warrior brandishes a whip to show\r\nthat he is on horseback; to dismount, he makes a pirouette on one leg\r\nand throws down his whip; to remount, he makes a pirouette on the other\r\nleg and picks it up again. But let me tell you the plot of the tragedy\r\nI saw, as Han Chang-kwei-ti explained it to me.\r\n\r\nA warrior in white has an everlasting feud with a rebel in red, who\r\nalways gets the better of him, and performs the most astounding\r\n_pas seuls_, making quite appalling faces (heightened by streaks of\r\nred, blue, and white paint) to the terror of the whole empire, as\r\nrepresented by five old men and two little boys in white. The warrior\r\nin white, after a series of stage combats with the rebel in red, which\r\nit would break the heart of our best pantomimists to imitate, sits down\r\nin an arm-chair and tucks up one leg under him, by which the audience\r\nare to understand that he has gone to sleep in a lonely forest. He\r\nthen dreams that the ghost of his father appears to him to teach him\r\na trick and give him a sword, by the aid of which he may circumvent\r\nthe rebel in red. The dream is represented by his getting up from his\r\nchair and acting through the scene with his father’s ghost, after\r\nwhich he sits down in the same posture as before. During one of his\r\ndead father’s speeches, which may have struck him, as they did me,\r\nas rather tedious, the actor felt a little thirsty, so he called for\r\na cup of tea, which a coolie brought to him, and he drank it with his\r\nface to the audience, gargling his throat and spitting out the last\r\nmouthful without the smallest regard for the situation. Well, the\r\nfather having stalked out, the warrior tucked up his leg again and then\r\nawoke. A final combat of many rounds then terminates in the victory of\r\nthe warrior, obtained by the grace of his father’s sword. The rebel is\r\nslain and walks out, and the victorious army, consisting of four wheezy\r\nold men, make a triumphal entry into the gates of the capital, which\r\nare signified by two coolies holding up two poles with a blue cotton\r\ncurtain in which a hole has been cut.\r\n\r\nThe dresses of the tragedians are magnificent. They are stiff with gold\r\nand embroidery, and immensely valuable. The masks and painting of the\r\nfaces are to the last degree grotesque and hideous. The beards and wigs\r\nare coarse and clumsily contrived.\r\n\r\nAfter two or three historical pieces have been played a farce follows,\r\nand indeed it is time that the proceedings should be enlivened a\r\nlittle. The farces are not difficult to follow (though I cannot say\r\nthat I understand writers whom I know to be ignorant of Chinese, and\r\nwho say that the acting of the Pekingese comedians is so good that\r\nthe whole play is quite intelligible; I know I was out of my depth\r\noften enough, in spite of the admirable acting, and of my being able\r\nto understand a great deal of the dialogue). The dialect is the pure\r\nPekingese vernacular, and the dialogue is spoken with the exception\r\nof a few songs. The women’s parts are played by boys, who imitate to\r\nperfection the mincing gait and affectations of the Chinese women—“the\r\ncarriage as graceful as the weeping willow”—sham small feet are\r\nattached to their own boots in order to carry out the illusion, which\r\nis quite perfect. These boys are bought in the south and trained up as\r\napprentices. They receive no pay from the head of their troupe, but\r\nthey earn largish sums by attending the banquets of the Chinese men\r\nabout town; when they are not actually playing, they go up into the\r\nprivate boxes to the richer visitors, whom they amuse with the last\r\ngossip of the green-room.\r\n\r\nThe farces are too indecent for me to do more than give you a mere\r\nsketch of one. Medea does not stop short of doing anything _coram\r\npopulo_, so I give you a sort of Bowdler’s family edition of the plot\r\nof one that I saw.\r\n\r\nA young gentleman of great wealth of the name of Wang has been ruined\r\nby a mistress named Yu Tang Chun, who, strange to say, although his\r\nmoney is all spent, still preserves a hankering for him. He, on the\r\nother hand, finding himself without a penny, is ashamed to go near her,\r\nso he retires to a temple to live by his wits. The scene opens with Yu\r\nTang Chun bewailing his absence and her solitude in a long recitative\r\nand song (rather pretty for Chinese music). To her enters the low\r\ncomedy man—such a good actor, and so full of fun!—who tells her where\r\nher lover is, and all about his deplorable state. She determines to\r\ngo and see him, and take him a present of 300 taels (£100) to enable\r\nhim to go to Peking and pass his examination. Accordingly, she sets\r\nout, and a table with the five offerings is placed upon the stage to\r\nrepresent a temple, to which she goes under the pretence of burning\r\njoss stick. As soon as she sees her lover the two set up a wild shriek,\r\nand rush into one another’s arms. Over what follows it is absolutely\r\nnecessary to draw a curtain. The play ends by her giving Wang the\r\nmoney. He starts for Peking, and returns in a second or two, having\r\npassed a brilliant examination and obtained high office. Sometimes,\r\nbut rarely, girls are present among the audience, and when this is the\r\ncase, it is only fair to say that these pieces—the grossness of which\r\npasses all belief—are not given. On those occasions the playbill is\r\nmade up of military and historic dramas, the propriety of which is as\r\nundeniable as their dulness.\r\n\r\nThe price of admission to the best theatres at Peking is one tiao\r\n(about 8d.) to the pit, something more to the gallery, and a private\r\nbox costs twelve tiaos. As the whole thing is, as I said before, a\r\nspeculation of the _restaurateur’s_, refreshments are hawked about\r\nduring the whole performance. There is a man who carries about a long\r\npipe (like Herr von Joel with his cigars at Evans’s), who is very\r\npersistent in seeking custom. If it is hot weather the people in the\r\npit take off their coats and lounge naked to the waist, sitting out the\r\nwhole performance from noon till seven P.M., after which they pack up\r\nwhat remains to them of their fruit and melon seeds, and go off home,\r\nnot having had near enough of it.\r\n\r\nI have been three or four times, and find that a couple of hours of the\r\ndin and smoke are as much as I can stand, besides which I find that\r\neating po-po out of politeness interferes with one’s dinner.\r\n\r\nMy time here is drawing very short. When I told my teacher that I was\r\ngoing away he hummed and hawed, and shifted about uneasily. At last\r\nhe summoned up courage and said, “Sir, I have one last favour to ask\r\nof you. The teachers of the West are very cunning in medicine; they\r\npossess many secrets. I have no child, and it is a great sorrow! Bitter\r\nis the life of the man who is childless! In vain have we addressed our\r\nprayers to the goddess Kwan Yin, my wife remains barren. Sir, if you\r\ncould give me some drug or some charm to remove this evil, for small\r\nfavours one can find thanks, but for so great a favour none!”\r\n\r\nDear to man is the fame for abstruse learning! But I was obliged to\r\nconfess myself at fault.\r\n\r\nI start for Japan on Monday week, and then good-bye to Peking!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                APPENDIX\r\n\r\n                         HOW MANDARINS ARE MADE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe literature of no country is so abundant in noble sentiments as that\r\nof China. Happy, indeed, would be the people who should be governed\r\naccording to the precepts of Confucius, of Mencius, and of Lao Tsŭ! The\r\nhighest moral and political principles are in every mouth, at the tip\r\nof every pen. From the first day of his entering school the Chinese boy\r\nlearns unctuously to recite the most virtuous precepts of the sages,\r\nyet learning is the one road to fortune through robbery, peculation,\r\nand extortion in their most refined shapes. With every rise in rank\r\nthe opportunities of robbing the “Hundred Names” and defrauding the\r\nstate are multiplied in a ratio increasing like the value of carats\r\nin diamonds: the wealth amassed by some of the great mandarins must\r\nbe something fabulous. Take as an instance the war with Japan. The\r\nChinese soldier, when properly led and fairly treated is an excellent\r\nfighting man. It is difficult to believe that the sons of the braves\r\nwho under Tsêng Kwo Fan and San Ko Lin Sin, so stubbornly defended the\r\nbridge against the French and English in 1860, could have been driven\r\nfrom an impregnable position like Fort Arthur by the Japanese some\r\nthirty years later. But what troops could fight without food, arms,\r\nammunition? Food, arms, ammunition, and pay had all found their way\r\ninto the pockets of the mandarins. Would the brigade of Guards itself\r\nhave stood to be mown down without being able to fire an effective shot\r\nin return? I was told on high authority that at the famous naval battle\r\nof the Yalu, which some experts have quoted as an object lesson in the\r\nnaval warfare of the future, on the Chinese side only three live shells\r\nwere fired, one of which disabled the Japanese flagship, and sent her\r\nsteaming away into space. The comparison of the bankers’ books of some\r\nof the great mandarins before and after the war would be an interesting\r\nstudy.\r\n\r\nThe mandarins—one is compelled to use the old Portuguese word for want\r\nof a better—are recruited from two classes: the hereditary nobility,\r\nand those who obtain office nominally by examination, but often by\r\npurchase.\r\n\r\nThe hereditary nobility is composed of the members of the Imperial\r\nfamily with the five ranks, Kung, Hou, Po, Tsŭ, Nan,—which it has been\r\nthe fashion to translate by duke, marquis, earl, viscount, baron.\r\n\r\nThe highest rank in the Imperial family is that of Chin Wang—“related\r\nprince,” or as we should say “Prince of the Blood.” In some cases this\r\ntitle is continued from generation to generation; in others there is\r\na sliding scale downward through the ranks of Pei Lo and Pei Tsŭ to\r\nthat of Kung or duke, below which members of the Imperial family do not\r\ndescend.\r\n\r\nIn the same way with subjects, the rank of Kung is sometimes\r\ntransmitted; in others the son of a Kung becomes a Hou, the son of a\r\nHou a Po, and so on. The inheritor of a title must be the eldest son\r\nof the one legitimate wife, and not of a secondary wife, for although\r\npolygamy exists in China, there is, except in the case of the Emperor’s\r\nfamily, only one legitimately married wife, nor in her lifetime can\r\nthere be another. The younger sons of nobles, even of the Imperial\r\nfamily, have no rank either by right or by courtesy; but the latter are\r\ngenerally raised to rank by being appointed general officers. Patents\r\nof nobility cannot be bought, at any rate not in theory.\r\n\r\nThe representative of the eldest branch of a family can, in the event\r\nof his being childless, adopt the child of a younger branch, and the\r\nchild so adopted inherits the title. It sometimes happens that a\r\nyounger brother who has become rich will bribe his eldest brother to\r\nadopt his child to the exclusion of the lawful heir and his issue.\r\n\r\nThe sovereign is, as with us, the fountain of honour, and it is he who\r\nconfers these titles of nobility, which are accompanied by grants of\r\nland. As a general rule the land assigned to a Kung or a Hou would not\r\nexceed a circumference of 100 li = 33 miles, to a Po 70 li, and to the\r\ntwo lesser ranks 50 li.\r\n\r\nConspicuous among the nobles of China are the Pa Ta Chia, “the Eight\r\ngreat Families.” These are the descendants of the eight Princes who,\r\nwaiving any claim to the throne, followed the reigning dynasty from\r\nManchuria. Their rank remains unchanged for all generations. The\r\nrepresentative of one of these, the Prince of I, was famous in the\r\nwar of 1860. A year later, at the time of the Prince of Kung’s _coup\r\nd’état_, he fell into disgrace, and was “presented with the white\r\nkerchief” (made to commit suicide).\r\n\r\nBut the Imperial family and the hereditary nobles at Peking, valuable\r\ninstruments of obstruction as they doubtless are, form but an\r\ninfinitesimal portion of that colossal octopus of fraud and corruption\r\nwhich strangles the whole vast empire in its tentacles. The myriads of\r\nofficials, from the exalted viceroys down to petty bloodsuckers of a\r\nrank about equal to that of a parish beadle, are either drawn from the\r\nso-called graduates of the examination halls, or have obtained their\r\npromotion by purchase—of the latter mode of reaching distinction there\r\nis nothing to be said; it is beautifully simple. But the examination\r\nsystem is very complicated and deserves some notice.\r\n\r\nThe following account of how mandarins are made is based upon an\r\narticle of mine, for the most part translated from a paper by a native\r\ngraduate, and published in _Macmillan’s Magazine_ in 1871:—\r\n\r\nAt the age of from six to eight years the Chinese boy is removed from\r\nthe petting and pampering of the women’s apartments and is sent to\r\nschool, where he receives his first lessons in reading and writing\r\nas purely mechanical processes. He is taught to read by droning out\r\npassages from the classics in hideous unison with his schoolmates,\r\nand to write by painting over characters printed on thin whitey-brown\r\npaper. This preliminary process of education lasts for some two\r\nyears or more, at the end of which the young student is looked upon\r\nas sufficiently advanced to be instructed in the meaning of what he\r\nreads. The books now put into his hands are, of course, the famous Four\r\nBooks and the Five Classics, every passage in which, with its hidden\r\nobscurities and doubtful interpretations, is diligently and painfully\r\nexplained to him, until not only the text itself, but also every note\r\nand commentary with which successive ages of scholars have overlaid it,\r\nare familiar in his mouth as household words. Having accomplished this\r\nend the youth is allowed to try a flight upon his own wings, and begins\r\nto write essays and poetry, which, by useful and assiduous reading,\r\nhe must model upon the best patterns. “Poetry of the Tang dynasty,\r\nhandwriting of the Chin dynasty, essays of the Han dynasty,” says the\r\nproverb; these, with all humility, should the student endeavour to\r\nfollow at however great a distance.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the young man’s compositions begin to take some sort of\r\nshape, and to satisfy the keen criticism of his master, when his\r\nlanguage is neatly fitted to his thoughts, and he does not use so\r\nmuch as a particle out of its place, he may look forward to preparing\r\nhimself to undergo his examination for the degree of Hsin Tsai, or\r\nBachelor of Arts.\r\n\r\nThe examiner for this degree is an officer from the Han Lin (lit.\r\nForest of Pencils), or Imperial Academy of Peking, and is specially\r\nappointed by the Emperor; one examiner is appointed for each province\r\nthroughout the country, and he holds his examinations from town to town\r\nin the chief places of the province to which he is accredited.\r\n\r\nWe will suppose the examination to be taking place at Shun Ti̔en Fu,\r\nthe provincial capital of Chih Li (the province in which Peking is\r\nsituated). The examiner, having arrived with no small arrogance of\r\ndignity, takes up his abode in the Examination Hall inside the town. On\r\nan appointed day the undergraduate candidates from the various Chou and\r\nHsien, or lesser towns which are dependent upon Shun Ti̔en Fu, crowd\r\ninto the hall, and take their places each according to the township\r\nto which he may belong. As soon as his flock is gathered together, the\r\nexaminer gives out two themes selected from the Four Books to serve\r\nas texts for essays, and one subject for an exercise in verse. Each\r\ncandidate is expected to produce two essays and one set of twelve\r\nverses in rhyme; but he has plenty of time to perform his task, for the\r\nexamination begins at four o’clock in the morning, and the papers are\r\nnot given in until between five and seven o’clock in the evening. On\r\nthe third day the examination list is given out: the examiner writes\r\nout the names of the successful candidates in order of merit, and gives\r\nit to the overseers of the hall, who, carrying it respectfully on their\r\nheads, go out and paste it on the wall fronting the entrance gate.\r\nThen follows a scene of excitement when the undergraduates besiege\r\nthe gate to search for their names on the list. (Oxford over again!)\r\n“Should they have been successful,” says a native account, “they are\r\nnow entitled to call themselves Hsin Tsai, and are so delighted that\r\nin their joy everything in heaven and earth seems lovely to them,” and\r\nthey look forward to the day when they will receive the much-coveted\r\nofficial button.[19] The unhappy plucked ones must make the best of\r\nit and try again. Even now the Hsin Tsai’s troubles are not over;\r\nfor there is a second examination, in which they are divided into\r\nthree classes—the first class being privileged graduates eligible\r\nfor honorary degrees entitling the possessors to become candidates\r\nfor bettermost civil appointments. There is yet another distinction\r\nopen to the privileged bachelors. Once in twelve years the degree of\r\nPa Kung is given to a representative of each petty township: it is\r\nalso conferred on the successful competitor in an examination held of\r\nprivileged bachelors, in which case it is awarded to the cleverest,\r\nmost respectable, and youngest of his class. When certain official\r\nappointments of an inferior grade are about to be made, the Emperor\r\nsummons the bachelors of the grade of Pa Kung to court, where they\r\nare again made to go through an examination, and divided into three\r\nclasses. The members of the first class are employed as brass button\r\nmandarins (officials of the seventh, eighth, and ninth classes); those\r\nof the second class are sent to be Chih Hsien, or magistrates of\r\nsmall towns; while the remainder are only eligible for employment as\r\nassistants in the public examinations.\r\n\r\nSuch, briefly, are the honours and offices open to a man who has passed\r\nhis first examination. The degree of Chü Jên is a much more serious\r\naffair.\r\n\r\nThis examination takes place in fixed years; and when the appointed\r\ntime comes all bachelors ambitious of promotion, together with a class\r\nof graduates called Chien Shêng, who have purchased their degree,\r\nprepare in fear and trembling for the ordeal.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th day of the 8th month of the year an Imperial decree is\r\nissued, appointing the officials who are to conduct the examination.\r\nThere are three chief examiners and eighteen assistant examiners, with\r\na whole number of subordinates, who search the candidates as they come\r\nin, to see that no books, or memoranda, or other aids to intelligence,\r\nare smuggled in; besides these there is a strong _posse_ of Imperial\r\ninformers, who watch all that goes on, and keep up a sort of secret\r\npolice in the hall. The whole of the compositions of the masters\r\nexpectant are handed over to copyists, who transcribe them, lest the\r\nhandwritings of the candidates being recognised by the examiners\r\nthere should be any foul play, and the copies so made are compared\r\nwith the originals by clerks appointed for the purpose. Besides all\r\nthese persons, there are 180 minor officials who superintend all petty\r\ndetails. The examination is divided into three parts. On the 8th day\r\nof the month the first part begins. The candidates are divided into\r\nfour companies, to each of which is assigned a door. At each of the\r\ndoors stand two Imperial informers—the one a Manchu, the other a\r\nChinese—whose duty it is to mark off the names of the candidates, and\r\nto distribute to each a roll of paper, giving the number of the cell\r\nallotted to him, to which he carries his provision of food and bedding,\r\nfor he will be locked up in solitary confinement for three days and\r\nnights. In the evening, when the candidates have all been pricked\r\nin, every door is sealed, and all coming in or going out is rendered\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nThe exercises set for the first part of the examination consist of\r\nthree essays from the Four Books, and one composition in verse. The\r\nfirst subject is selected, or supposed to be selected, by the Emperor\r\nin person, and the remainder are chosen by the chief examiners. The\r\n_Cycle_, an English newspaper published at Shanghai, once gave the\r\ntexts chosen for such exercises at an examination held at Wu Chang.\r\n\r\nI. From the _Lun Yu_, the _Analects of Confucius_:—“Tsŭ Yu, being\r\ngovernor of Wu Ching, the master said to him, ‘Have you got such a\r\nthing as a real Man in the place?’ He answered, ‘Here is Tan Tai Mieh\r\nMing, who does not in walking side off by a short cut, nor come to my\r\noffice except on public business.’”\r\n\r\nII. From the _Chung Yung_ of Kung Chi, the grandson of Confucius:—“He\r\nonly who is accomplished, learned, profound, and critical, has\r\nwherewith to exercise sound judgment.”\r\n\r\nIII. From the _Shang Mang_ of Mencius:—“When any one told Tsŭ Lu that\r\nhe had a fault he was pleased with him. When Yu heard anybody say a\r\nwise thing he bowed to him.”\r\n\r\nEach of these essays was required to contain not less than three\r\nhundred, nor more than eight hundred words.\r\n\r\nThe theme for the poetical exercise was “An observer of the beauties\r\nof Nature being so absorbed as to forget the march of a whole round of\r\nseasons.”\r\n\r\nSuch are the proofs of superior wisdom and learning in which if a man\r\nexcel he is qualified to rule others! Chinese scholarship is very\r\ndifficult of attainment; perhaps if it were impossible the world would\r\nhardly be much the poorer.\r\n\r\nWhen the subjects have been selected and approved by the Emperor, they\r\nare sealed up in a box and given over to the care of a chief eunuch of\r\nthe palace, to be handed to the chief examiners, who cause them to be\r\nengraved on wood and printed. On the 10th day of the month the essays\r\nare handed in, and the candidates leave the building.\r\n\r\nThe officers having received the exercises, examine them carefully to\r\nsee whether there be any informality in them: if they should discover\r\nanything like an infringement of prescribed custom the papers are\r\nrejected, the peccant candidate’s name is struck off the list, and\r\nhe is incapacitated from taking part in the second examination. If\r\nthe papers are in due form they are sent into the copying department,\r\nwhere they are copied in red ink; thence into the comparing department,\r\nand sealing department, where the mottoes borne by the originals are\r\npasted on to them. They now find their way into the superintendent’s\r\noffice, and he forwards them to the eighteen junior examiners.\r\n\r\nWith pain and care, measuring every word and weighing to a nicety the\r\nfitness of every particle, these learned men apply themselves to the\r\ncriticism of the papers before them. Those that find favour in their\r\neyes are docketed as good, and given back to the superintendent, who\r\npasses them to the three chiefs. Should they fail to satisfy these they\r\nare thrown into the waste-paper basket, but the candidate still has the\r\ncredit of having passed the first test. Should they satisfy the chiefs\r\nthey are marked with the character Chung, signifying that they have hit\r\nthe mark; but only a limited number of candidates are admitted to the\r\ndegree at one examination.\r\n\r\nThe second examination takes place on the 11th day of the month,\r\nand consists in writing five essays upon texts taken from the Five\r\nClassics; the third test, which is held on the 14th of the month, is\r\ndevoted to the propounding of five sets of questions on the subject\r\nof literature, political economy, or general science. According to\r\nthe _Cycle_, “the first question asked at Wu Chang was of the nature\r\nof criticism of the classics; the second question was on historical\r\nmatters; the third on military colonisation. (The Chinese Government\r\nhoping to save their western provinces by allotting land to soldiers\r\non the frontier line, requiring them to keep themselves in readiness\r\nfor fighting.) The fourth question entered into the various plans\r\nadopted by previous dynasties in the selection of suitable persons to\r\nhold the offices of government. The fifth question referred to the\r\nancient and modern geography of Ching Chan Fu, the course of the waters\r\nof the Han and the Yangtze, and the history of the Tung Ting Lake.” The\r\nanswers to each of the five questions were to contain a minimum of five\r\nhundred words.\r\n\r\nIt occasionally happens that after the list of successful candidates\r\nhas been made up, the work of some new bachelor is recommended to the\r\nnotice of the examiners. Should the essays which he sends in show\r\npre-eminent ability, their fortunate author is rewarded with the degree\r\nof Fu Pang, or assistant master; and if the list of Fu Pang be already\r\nfull, then he is appointed Tan Lu, a distinction bringing with it no\r\nadvancement in rank in the state, but rendering its possessor eligible\r\nfor certain offices.\r\n\r\nDuring the examination at Wu Chang a subordinate official of the\r\nexamination hall was convicted of having passed manuscripts to one of\r\nthe candidates. The punishment was summary. The official was beheaded,\r\nthe candidate banished to the frontiers, and the graduate who wrote the\r\nforged essay was sentenced to be executed when captured. As the writer\r\nof the article in the _Cycle_, from which I have quoted, observes, “It\r\nis interesting to find the Chinese authorities so prompt and just in\r\npunishing the guilty. If some unfortunate foreigner had been murdered\r\nby these precious literati, the governor would have declared it to\r\nbe impossible to touch the offenders in the presence of a myriad of\r\nmembers of their order.” More probably he would either have declared\r\nthat he could not find them, or have executed a certain number of\r\njail-birds as substitutes.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the candidate was a foolish candidate, and hush-money was\r\neither wanting or insufficient. But in that case it was as it should\r\nbe, for by not bribing he clearly showed his incapacity for holding\r\nhigh official position. He did not recognise the privileges of the\r\nclass which it was his ambition to enter, and he gave the officers of\r\nthe hall an opportunity of showing a little cheap zeal in the execution\r\nof their duty, to his great discomfiture.\r\n\r\nWhen the three tests are ended and the degrees have all been conferred,\r\nthe superintendent of the examination hall addresses a petition to\r\nthe Emperor, praying that a day may be fixed for publishing the names\r\nof the successful candidates. This generally takes place on the\r\n10th day of the following month. On the first day of the ceremonies\r\nof publication a table is ordered to be set out in the hall called\r\nChih Kung Tang, the Hall of Justice unsurpassed. The three chief\r\nexaminers, with the two chief superintendents, solemnly take their\r\nplaces at the table, and on either side, spread out diagonally “like\r\na goose’s wings,” as the Chinese writer puts it, are the eighteen\r\njunior examiners, all clad in their official robes. All this galaxy of\r\nlearning and wisdom is gathered together to witness the breaking of\r\nthe seals of the exercises, and to hear the calling out of the names\r\nwhich are written on the list. Next morning, before daybreak, the list\r\nis rolled up and placed inside a palanquin of honour, richly decorated\r\nwith coloured silks; a procession is formed, headed by standard-bearers\r\ncarrying emblems, as at a wedding, and the whole heaven is filled with\r\nthe sound of drums and of delicate music, gongs being beaten to clear\r\nthe road. Immediately behind the palanquin containing the precious\r\nlist march the chief examiners and their subordinates, who accompany\r\nit outside the Dragon Gate. This gate of the examination hall is so\r\ncalled allegorically, because in the same way as the fish rose from\r\nthe sea to heaven, and became perfected into the heavenly dragon, so\r\nthe successful candidates have, by the grace of learning, cast off the\r\ngrosser clay of which they were formed, and have risen to the heaven of\r\nrank and fame. The superintendents of the hall escort the list as far\r\nas the outer gate of the provincial capital, where it is hung up on a\r\nhigh platform specially erected for the purpose.\r\n\r\nWhen the list has thus been finally published, etiquette requires\r\nthat the new Masters of Arts should go and pay their respects to the\r\nchief and junior examiners. At these visits much wine is drunk, and an\r\nadjournment to the theatre takes place, where the party witness the\r\ndeadly dulness of an historical piece, relieved, it is true, by the\r\nperformance of grossly indecent farces, and by the consumption of the\r\nusual refreshments of fried melon-seeds, sweetmeats, cakes, and tea.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all the pains taken nominally to insure fairness and\r\nexclude any possibility of trickery, Chinese ingenuity would belie\r\nitself if it did not find means of giving the slip to all law and rule,\r\nand of satisfying greed thereby. Though the candidate’s name is not\r\nknown until the papers have been examined and judged, they will be\r\nframed in such a way as to let the examiner know who is the author—as,\r\nfor instance, by agreeing beforehand that the briber’s essay shall\r\nbegin and end with certain words. On the other hand, if the officers of\r\nthe copying and comparing departments have not received their fee, they\r\ncan throw any candidate’s work all out of tune with the greatest ease.\r\nNor is there any appeal. The copy in red ink which is sent in to the\r\njunior examiners stands as the _ipsissima verba_ of the writer. By one\r\nslip a spiteful copyist may spoil the best essay.\r\n\r\nThe examination for the third and highest degree, that of Chin Shih, or\r\nDoctor, does not differ materially in character from that of Chü Jên\r\nor Master of Arts, except in the fact that whereas the latter is held\r\nin provincial capitals, the former is held only at Shun Tien Fu, at\r\nwhich city the candidates from every part of the empire have to attend.\r\nThe expense and difficulties of what may be a very long and expensive\r\njourney naturally tend to limit the number of aspirants.\r\n\r\nAfter the publication of the list of successful candidates a last\r\nexamination is held at Peking in the Imperial palace. According to\r\ntheir performances in this final test the doctors are divided into\r\nthree classes. The first class consists only of the three best men in\r\norder of merit, who are called respectively Chuang Yüan, Pang Yüan, and\r\nTan Hwa, which might be translated Senior Wrangler, Second Wrangler,\r\nand Golden Spoon; the second class contains from seven to ten names;\r\nand the third class is made up of the remainder, and may consist of two\r\nhundred men or more. At the second part of this examination the doctors\r\nare presented to the Son of Heaven, who in person appoints them to\r\nvarious offices in the state. The Senior Wrangler is usually employed\r\nas a writer of records in the Forest of Pencils, while the Second\r\nWrangler and the Golden Spoon are appointed to be correctors. All the\r\ndoctors are sure of obtaining some appointment, but not of keeping it\r\nunless they show official capacity, of which the most infallible proof\r\nis the liberal opening of a long purse.\r\n\r\n“In the olden time,” writes a native author, “a man need only pass the\r\ndegree of Hsin Tsai, or Bachelor, to be sure of obtaining some office\r\nin the state. But nowadays there are too many who buy their rank, so\r\nthat a man’s merit is measured by the capacity of his purse, while the\r\nright men are pushed out of the right place. Hence it comes that many a\r\nripe scholar, if he have but enough means to keep the life within him,\r\nand be a man of spirit to boot, will rather remain in obscurity as a\r\nprivate individual than be mixed up with such men as hold office. Good\r\nmen holding aloof, the officials of the country are but a sorry lot\r\nafter all. How can we be surprised if discontent and treason are rife?”\r\n\r\nThese are the words of a modern scholar, savouring somewhat of sour\r\ngrapes, it is true. Yet as early as five hundred years before Christ,\r\nLao Tsŭ, the founder of the Taoist sect, pointed out the vanity and\r\nhollowness of the system of education and government into which the\r\ncountry was drifting. “If some men,” said the sage, “would abandon\r\ntheir learning and cast away their wisdom the people would be benefited\r\na hundred-fold.” Of all the Chinese philosophers Lao Tsŭ was probably\r\nthe one whose teaching of simple virtue approached the nearest to the\r\nChristian standard. Confucius himself, after having had an interview\r\nwith him, said to his disciples, “I know how the birds fly, how the\r\nfishes swim, how the beasts run, and the runner may be snared, the\r\nswimmer may be hooked, and the flyer may be shot by the arrow.[20] But\r\nthere is the dragon. I cannot tell how he mounts on the wind through\r\nthe clouds and rises to heaven. To-day I have seen Lao Tsŭ, and can\r\nonly compare him to the dragon.”[21]\r\n\r\nIt can hardly be said that matters have improved since the old days of\r\nLao Tsŭ.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN OF PEKING\r\n\r\nBy permission of “The Times.”\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCE.\r\n\r\n  1.

CLARK, LIMITED, _Edinburgh_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               FOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] There have been five Tartar dynasties—the Liao, A.D. 907–1125;\r\nthe Western Liao, A.D. 1125–1168; the Chin, which came to an end in\r\nA.D. 1234; the Yüan, ending A.D. 1341, and the Ching, or present\r\ndynasty, which began in A.D. 1627. (I have not taken into account some\r\noverlappings of reigns which would need long explanation.)\r\n\r\n[2] They are supposed by Mr. Finn “to have belonged to the restoration\r\nfrom Chaldea, as they had portions of Malachi and Zechariah, adopted\r\nthe era of Seleucus, and had many rabbinical customs.” They were found,\r\nby two native Christians sent by Bishop Smith to inquire into their\r\npresent condition, to be in abject poverty, ignorance, and dejection.\r\nThey knew no Hebrew, but had been instructed in copying the letters of\r\nHoly Writ.—Wells Williams, _Middle Kingdom_, ii. 272.\r\n\r\n[3] In those days the jinrikisha had not been invented.\r\n\r\n[4] This, be it remembered, was written in 1865, and was the most\r\ndesponding view taken at that time even by those who were the gloomiest\r\nprophets.\r\n\r\n[5] Pa Li Chiao, the Eight Li Bridge (a Li is about a third of a mile),\r\nso called from its distance from Peking.\r\n\r\n[6] Great improvements have been effected in late years.\r\n\r\n[7] See Note, p. 73.\r\n\r\n[8] This is the more curious, as rice is by no means the staple food of\r\nthis part of China. It is bad and dear here, the common fare or staple\r\nof the people being millet—a poor food—to which they add much garlic\r\nfor nourishment.\r\n\r\n[9] Pulled down in 1864.\r\n\r\n[10] The crime of parricide includes high treason, murder of parents,\r\nelders in the family, and of the teacher, in such reverence is learning\r\nheld. The murder of a master by an apprentice comes under the same\r\ncategory. A parricide is said to be an “owl-tiger,” both animals being\r\nsupposed to devour their parents. The owl especially eats its mother’s\r\nhead and eyes. The laugh of an owl portends death in a family.\r\n\r\n[11] They were massacred a year later, their murder leading to the\r\nabortive French expedition against Corea.\r\n\r\n[12] In the following year this accomplished and adventurous gentleman\r\nmade another trip to Corea in an American ship. Not one of the party\r\nwas ever seen again, but a report reached Peking that the Coreans had\r\nburnt the ship with all hands in the river not far from Saoul.\r\n\r\n[13] Wang, a prince; Chi̔n Wang, a prince of the first rank who is\r\npersonally related to the Emperor.\r\n\r\n[14] “Fu,” a bat, by a pun, also means happiness. “Wu fu,” the five\r\nbats, or five happinesses, are a common emblem in Chinese ornamentation.\r\n\r\n[15] I must remind the reader that this was written in 1866.\r\n\r\n[16] In the far East the dragon, associated in our myths with fire, is\r\na water spirit. At the miraculous birth of Buddha two heavenly dragons\r\nappeared in the air, the one spouting cold, the other warm water, to\r\nwash the holy babe. Hence bronze dragons are commonly seen in temples\r\nand in other places as water-spouts, where in the West the lion’s head\r\nwould be used. The lion as a fountain comes from the ancient Egyptians,\r\nwhose astronomers held that the rising of the Nile was bound to take\r\nplace when the sun was in Leo.\r\n\r\n[17] Alas! both he and Farquhar fell victims to the climate and died of\r\nfever.\r\n\r\n[18] See preface.\r\n\r\n[19] There are nine official buttons, each denoting an official\r\nrank—each divided into a first and second class. The civilian takes\r\nprecedence of the military officer—_cedunt arma togæ_.\r\n\r\n[20] Compare the account given of Solomon’s wisdom, 1 Kings iv.\r\n29:—“And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and\r\nlargeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea-shore. And\r\nSolomon’s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east\r\ncountry, and all the wisdom of Egypt.... And he spake three thousand\r\nproverbs: and his songs were a thousand and five. And he spake of\r\ntrees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that\r\nspringeth out of the wall: he spake also of beasts, and of fowls, and\r\nof creeping things, and of fishes. And there came of all people to hear\r\nthe wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, which had heard of\r\nhis wisdom.”\r\n\r\n[21] _The Speculations of the Old Philosopher Lao Tsŭ_, translated by\r\nJohn Chalmers.

It is much more than a book\r\nof travel. In her studies of the people, in her character-sketches\r\nof the leading personalities, foreign and native, who fill the stage\r\nof the great Chinese drama, in her quick-witted appreciation of the\r\npolitical issues at stake, she shows herself an acute and well-informed\r\nobserver who has sought diligently for the solution which must underlie\r\nthe mystery of a ‘land of contradictions, puzzles, and enigmas.’”\r\n\r\n_SPECTATOR._—“The most brilliant and interesting picture of the\r\nlong-lived Empire that we are acquainted with.... Her knowledge is\r\ngreat, her power of pictorial writing remarkable, and her style is full\r\nof light and grace.”\r\n\r\n_PILOT._—“A very readable book, crammed with information of many\r\ntopics, and telling of many curious sights.”\r\n\r\n_PALL MALL GAZETTE._—“A most charming and readable book.... Once taken\r\nup the book is as hard to put down as a good novel.... We cannot too\r\nstrongly recommend the perusal of this book to all at the present time.\r\nIt will serve as a most admirable commentary to the all-engrossing\r\nevents now passing in the Far East. There are many good illustrations.”\r\n\r\n_DAILY NEWS._—“The book is to be recommended as a lively and vivid\r\naccount of Chinese life and character. With its sketches of scenes\r\nand persons wherewith the entire world is now concerned, ‘China, the\r\nLong-lived Empire’ appears at an opportune moment. It contains a large\r\nnumber of good illustrations.”\r\n\r\n_DAILY CHRONICLE._—“Miss Scidmore unites to the keen and sympathetic\r\nobservation of a travelled woman the judicial mind of a veteran judge.\r\nThis is high praise, we know, but nobody who has studied China and\r\nreads this book will think it exaggerated.”\r\n\r\n_ST.
