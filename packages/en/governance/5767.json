I want to tell you what has been done in the last few\r\ndays, why it was done, and what the next steps are going to be.  I\r\nrecognize that the many proclamations from state capitols and from\r\nWashington, the legislation, the treasury regulations, etc.,\r\ncouched for the most part in banking and legal terms should be\r\nexplained for the benefit of the average citizen.  I owe this in\r\nparticular because of the fortitude and good temper with which\r\neverybody has accepted the inconvenience and hardships of the\r\nbanking holiday.  I know that when you understand what we in\r\nWashington have been about I shall continue to have your\r\ncooperation as fully as I have had your sympathy and help during\r\nthe past week.\r\n\r\nFirst of all let me state the simple fact that when you deposit\r\nmoney in a bank the bank does not put the money into a safe deposit\r\nvault.  It invests your money in many different forms of credit--\r\nbonds, commercial paper, mortgages and many other kinds of loans.\r\nIn other words, the bank puts your money to work to keep the wheels\r\nof industry and of agriculture turning around.  A comparatively\r\nsmall part of the money you put into the bank is kept in currency--\r\nan amount which in normal times is wholly sufficient to cover the\r\ncash needs of the average citizen.  In other words, the total amount\r\nof all the currency in the country is only a small fraction of the\r\ntotal deposits in all of the banks.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, happened during the last few days of February and the\r\nfirst few days of March?  Because of undermined confidence on the\r\npart of the public, there was a general rush by a large portion of\r\nour population to turn bank deposits into currency or gold--a rush\r\nso great that the soundest banks could not get enough currency to\r\nmeet the demand.  The reason for this was that on the spur of the\r\nmoment it was, of course, impossible to sell perfectly sound assets\r\nof a bank and convert them into cash except at panic prices far\r\nbelow their real value.\r\n\r\nBy the afternoon of March 3d scarcely a bank in the country was\r\nopen to do business.  Proclamations temporarily closing them in\r\nwhole or in part had been issued by the governors in almost all the\r\nstates.\r\n\r\nIt was then that I issued the proclamation providing for the\r\nnation-wide bank holiday, and this was the first step in the\r\ngovernment's reconstruction of our financial and economic fabric.\r\n\r\nThe second step was the legislation promptly and patriotically\r\npassed by the Congress confirming my proclamation and broadening my\r\npowers so that it became possible in view of the requirement of\r\ntime to extend the holiday and lift the ban of that holiday\r\ngradually.  This law also gave authority to develop a program of\r\nrehabilitation of our banking facilities.  I want to tell our\r\ncitizens in every part of the nation that the national Congress--\r\nRepublicans and Democrats alike--showed by this action a devotion\r\nto public welfare and a realization of the emergency and the\r\nnecessity for speed that it is difficult to match in our history.\r\n\r\nThe third stage has been the series of regulations permitting the\r\nbanks to continue their functions to take care of the distribution\r\nof food and household necessities and the payment of payrolls.\r\n\r\nThis bank holiday, while resulting in many cases in great\r\ninconvenience, is affording us the opportunity to supply the\r\ncurrency necessary to meet the situation.  No sound bank is a dollar\r\nworse off than it was when it closed its doors last Monday.  Neither\r\nis any bank which may turn out not to be in a position for\r\nimmediate opening.  The new law allows the twelve Federal Reserve\r\nBanks to issue additional currency on good assets and thus the\r\nbanks which reopen will be able to meet every legitimate call.  The\r\nnew currency is being sent out by the Bureau of Engraving and\r\nPrinting in large volume to every part of the country.  It is sound\r\ncurrency because it is backed by actual, good assets.\r\n\r\nA question you will ask is this:  why are all the banks not to be\r\nreopened at the same time?  The answer is simple.  Your government\r\ndoes not intend that the history of the past few years shall be\r\nrepeated.  We do not want and will not have another epidemic of bank\r\nfailures.\r\n\r\nAs a result, we start tomorrow, Monday, with the opening of banks\r\nin the twelve Federal Reserve Bank cities--those banks which on\r\nfirst examination by the treasury have already been found to be all\r\nright.  This will be followed on Tuesday by the resumption of all\r\ntheir functions by banks already found to be sound in cities where\r\nthere are recognized clearing houses.  That means about 250 cities\r\nof the United states.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday and succeeding days banks in smaller places all\r\nthrough the country will resume business, subject, of course, to\r\nthe government's physical ability to complete its survey.  It is\r\nnecessary that the reopening of banks be extended over a period in\r\norder to permit the banks to make applications for necessary loans,\r\nto obtain currency needed to meet their requirements and to enable\r\nthe government to make common sense checkups.\r\n\r\nLet me make it clear to you that if your bank does not open the\r\nfirst day you are by no means justified in believing that it will\r\nnot open.  A bank that opens on one of the subsequent days is in\r\nexactly the same status as the bank that opens tomorrow.\r\n\r\nI know that many people are worrying about state banks not members\r\nof the Federal Reserve System.  These banks can and will receive\r\nassistance from members banks and from the Reconstruction Finance\r\nCorporation.  These state banks are following the same course as the\r\nnational banks except that they get their licenses to resume\r\nbusiness from the state authorities, and these authorities have\r\nbeen asked by the Secretary of the Treasury to permit their good\r\nbanks to open up on the same schedule as the national banks.  I am\r\nconfident that the state banking departments will be as careful as\r\nthe national government in the policy relating to the opening of\r\nbanks and will follow the same broad policy.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that when the banks resume a very few people who\r\nhave not recovered from their fear may again begin withdrawals.  Let\r\nme make it clear that the banks will take care of all needs--and it\r\nis my belief that hoarding during the past week has become an\r\nexceedingly unfashionable pastime.  It needs no prophet to tell you\r\nthat when the people find that they can get their money--that they\r\ncan get it when they want it for all legitimate purposes--the\r\nphantom of fear will soon be laid.  People will again be glad to\r\nhave their money where it will be safely taken care of and where\r\nthey can use it conveniently at any time.  I can assure you that it\r\nis safer to keep your money in a reopened bank than under the\r\nmattress.\r\n\r\nThe success of our whole great national program depends, of course,\r\nupon the cooperation of the public--on its intelligent support and\r\nuse of a reliable system.\r\n\r\nRemember that the essential accomplishment of the new legislation\r\nis that it makes it possible for banks more readily to convert\r\ntheir assets into cash than was the case before.  More liberal\r\nprovision has been made for banks to borrow on these assets at the\r\nReserve Banks and more liberal provision has also been made for\r\nissuing currency on the security of those good assets.  This\r\ncurrency is not fiat currency.  It is issued only on adequate\r\nsecurity--and every good bank has an abundance of such security.\r\n\r\nOne more point before I close.  There will be, of course, some banks\r\nunable to reopen without being reorganized.  The new law allows the\r\ngovernment to assist in making these reorganizations quickly and\r\neffectively and even allows the government to subscribe to at least\r\na part of new capital which may be required.\r\n\r\nI hope you can see from this elemental recital of what your\r\ngovernment is doing that there is nothing complex, or radical, in\r\nthe process.\r\n\r\nWe had a bad banking situation.  Some of our bankers had shown\r\nthemselves either incompetent or dishonest in their handling of the\r\npeople's funds.  They had used the money entrusted to them in\r\nspeculations and unwise loans.  This was, of course, not true in the\r\nvast majority of our banks, but it was true in enough of them to\r\nshock the people for a time into a sense of insecurity and to put\r\nthem into a frame of mind where they did not differentiate, but\r\nseemed to assume that the acts of a comparative few had tainted\r\nthem all.  It was the government's job to straighten out this\r\nsituation and do it as quickly as possible--and the job is being\r\nperformed.\r\n\r\nI do not promise you that every bank will be reopened or that\r\nindividual losses will not be suffered, but there will be no losses\r\nthat possibly could be avoided; and there would have been more and\r\ngreater losses had we continued to drift.  I can even promise you\r\nsalvation for some at least of the sorely pressed banks.  We shall\r\nbe engaged not merely in reopening sound banks but in the creation\r\nof sound banks through reorganization.\r\n\r\nIt has been wonderful to me to catch the note of confidence from\r\nall over the country.  I can never be sufficiently grateful to the\r\npeople for the loyal support they have given me in their acceptance\r\nof the judgment that has dictated our course, even though all our\r\nprocesses may not have seemed clear to them.\r\n\r\nAfter all, there is an element in the readjustment of our financial\r\nsystem more important than currency, more important than gold, and\r\nthat is the confidence of the people.  Confidence and courage are\r\nthe essentials of success in carrying out our plan.  You people must\r\nhave faith; you must not be stampeded by rumors or guesses.  Let us\r\nunite in banishing fear.  We have provided the machinery to restore\r\nour financial system; it is up to you to support and make it work.\r\n\r\nIt is your problem no less than it is mine.  Together we cannot\r\nfail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMay 7, 1933.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn a Sunday night a week after my inauguration I used the radio to\r\ntell you about the banking crisis and the measures we were taking\r\nto meet it.  I think that in that way I made clear to the country\r\nvarious facts that might otherwise have been misunderstood and in\r\ngeneral provided a means of understanding which did much to restore\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\nTonight, eight weeks later, I come for the second time to give you\r\nmy report; in the same spirit and by the same means to tell you\r\nabout what we have been doing and what we are planning to do.\r\n\r\nTwo months ago we were facing serious problems.  The country was\r\ndying by inches.  It was dying because trade and commerce had\r\ndeclined to dangerously low levels; prices for basic commodities\r\nwere such as to destroy the value of the assets of national\r\ninstitutions such as banks, savings banks, insurance companies, and\r\nothers.  These institutions, because of their great needs, were\r\nforeclosing mortgages, calling loans, refusing credit.  Thus there\r\nwas actually in process of destruction the property of millions of\r\npeople who had borrowed money on that property in terms of dollars\r\nwhich had had an entirely different value from the level of March,\r\n1933.  That situation in that crisis did not call for any\r\ncomplicated consideration of economic panaceas or fancy plans.  We\r\nwere faced by a condition and not a theory.\r\n\r\nThere were just two alternatives:  The first was to allow the\r\nforeclosures to continue, credit to be withheld and money to go\r\ninto hiding, and thus forcing liquidation and bankruptcy of banks,\r\nrailroads and insurance companies and a recapitalizing of all\r\nbusiness and all property on a lower level.  This alternative meant\r\na continuation of what is loosely called \"deflation\", the net\r\nresult of which would have been extraordinary hardships on all\r\nproperty owners and, incidentally, extraordinary hardships on all\r\npersons working for wages through an increase in unemployment and a\r\nfurther reduction of the wage scale.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see that the result of this course would have not\r\nonly economic effects of a very serious nature but social results\r\nthat might bring incalculable harm.  Even before I was inaugurated I\r\ncame to the conclusion that such a policy was too much to ask the\r\nAmerican people to bear.  It involved not only a further loss of\r\nhomes, farms, savings and wages but also a loss of spiritual\r\nvalues--the loss of that sense of security for the present and the\r\nfuture so necessary to the peace and contentment of the individual\r\nand of his family.  When you destroy these things you will find it\r\ndifficult to establish confidence of any sort in the future.  It was\r\nclear that mere appeals from Washington for confidence and the mere\r\nlending of more money to shaky institutions could not stop this\r\ndownward course.  A prompt program applied as quickly as possible\r\nseemed to me not only justified but imperative to our national\r\nsecurity.  The Congress, and when I say Congress I mean the members\r\nof both political parties, fully understood this and gave me\r\ngenerous and intelligent support.  The members of Congress realized\r\nthat the methods of normal times had to be replaced in the\r\nemergency by measures which were suited to the serious and pressing\r\nrequirements of the moment.  There was no actual surrender of power,\r\nCongress still retained its constitutional authority, and no one\r\nhas the slightest desire to change the balance of these powers.  The\r\nfunction of Congress is to decide what has to be done and to select\r\nthe appropriate agency to carry out its will.  To this policy it has\r\nstrictly adhered.  The only thing that has been happening has been\r\nto designate the President as the agency to carry out certain of\r\nthe purposes of the Congress.  This was constitutional and in\r\nkeeping with the past American tradition.\r\n\r\nThe legislation which has been passed or is in the process of\r\nenactment can properly be considered as part of a well-grounded\r\nplan.\r\n\r\nFirst, we are giving opportunity of employment to one-quarter of a\r\nmillion of the unemployed, especially the young men who have\r\ndependents, to go into the forestry and flood prevention work.  This\r\nis a big task because it means feeding, clothing and caring for\r\nnearly twice as many men as we have in the regular army itself.  In\r\ncreating this civilian conservation corps we are killing two birds\r\nwith one stone.  We are clearly enhancing the value of our natural\r\nresources and we are relieving an appreciable amount of actual\r\ndistress.  This great group of men has entered upon its work on a\r\npurely voluntary basis; no military training is involved and we are\r\nconserving not only our natural resources, but our human resources.\r\nOne of the great values to this work is the fact that it is direct\r\nand requires the intervention of very little machinery.\r\n\r\nSecond, I have requested the Congress and have secured action upon\r\na proposal to put the great properties owned by our government at\r\nMuscle Shoals to work after long years of wasteful inaction, and\r\nwith this a broad plan for the improvement of a vast area in the\r\nTennessee Valley.  It will add to the comfort and happiness of\r\nhundreds of thousands of people and the incident benefits will\r\nreach the entire nation.\r\n\r\nNext, the Congress is about to pass legislation that will greatly\r\nease the mortgage distress among the farmers and the home owners of\r\nthe nation, by providing for the easing of the burden of debt now\r\nbearing so heavily upon millions of our people.\r\n\r\nOur next step in seeking immediate relief is a grant of half a\r\nbillion dollars to help the states, counties and municipalities in\r\ntheir duty to care for those who need direct and immediate relief.\r\n\r\nThe Congress also passed legislation authorizing the sale of beer\r\nin such states as desired it.  This has already resulted in\r\nconsiderable reemployment and incidentally has provided much needed\r\ntax revenue.\r\n\r\nWe are planning to ask the Congress for legislation to enable the\r\ngovernment to undertake public works, thus stimulating directly and\r\nindirectly the employment of many others in well-considered\r\nprojects.\r\n\r\nFurther legislation has been taken up which goes much more\r\nfundamentally into our economic problems.  The Farm Relief Bill\r\nseeks by the use of several methods, alone or together, to bring\r\nabout an increased return to farmers for their major farm products,\r\nseeking at the same time to prevent in the days to come disastrous\r\noverproduction which so often in the past has kept farm commodity\r\nprices far below a reasonable return.  This measure provides wide\r\npowers for emergencies.  The extent of its use will depend entirely\r\nupon what the future has in store.\r\n\r\nWell-considered and conservative measures will likewise be proposed\r\nwhich will attempt to give to the industrial workers of the country\r\na more fair wage return, prevent cut-throat competition and unduly\r\nlong hours for labor, and at the same time encourage each industry\r\nto prevent overproduction.\r\n\r\nOur Railroad Bill falls into the same class because it seeks to\r\nprovide and make certain definite planning by the railroads\r\nthemselves, with the assistance of the government, to eliminate the\r\nduplication and waste that is now resulting in railroad\r\nreceiverships and continuing operating deficits.\r\n\r\nI am certain that the people of this country understand and approve\r\nthe broad purposes behind these new governmental policies relating\r\nto agriculture and industry and transportation.  We found ourselves\r\nfaced with more agricultural products than we could possibly\r\nconsume ourselves and surpluses which other nations did not have\r\nthe cash to buy from us except at prices ruinously low.  We found\r\nour factories able to turn out more goods than we could possibly\r\nconsume, and at the same time we were faced with a falling export\r\ndemand.  We found ourselves with more facilities to transport goods\r\nand crops than there were goods and crops to be transported.  All of\r\nthis has been caused in large part by a complete lack of planning\r\nand a complete failure to understand the danger signals that have\r\nbeen flying ever since the close of the World War.  The people of\r\nthis country have been erroneously encouraged to believe that they\r\ncould keep on increasing the output of farm and factory\r\nindefinitely and that some magician would find ways and means for\r\nthat increased output to be consumed with reasonable profit to the\r\nproducer.\r\n\r\nToday we have reason to believe that things are a little better\r\nthan they were two months ago.  Industry has picked up, railroads\r\nare carrying more freight, farm prices are better, but I am not\r\ngoing to indulge in issuing proclamations of overenthusiastic\r\nassurance.  We cannot ballyhoo ourselves back to prosperity.  I am\r\ngoing to be honest at all times with the people of the country.  I\r\ndo not want the people of this country to take the foolish course\r\nof letting this improvement come back on another speculative wave.\r\nI do not want the people to believe that because of unjustified\r\noptimism we can resume the ruinous practice of increasing our crop\r\noutput and our factory output in the hope that a kind Providence\r\nwill find buyers at high prices.  Such a course may bring us\r\nimmediate and false prosperity but it will be the kind of\r\nprosperity that will lead us into another tailspin.\r\n\r\nIt is wholly wrong to call the measure that we have taken\r\ngovernment control of farming, control of industry, and control of\r\ntransportation.  It is rather a partnership between government and\r\nfarming and industry and transportation, not partnership in\r\nprofits, for the profits still go to the citizens, but rather a\r\npartnership in planning and partnership to see that the plans are\r\ncarried out.\r\n\r\nLet me illustrate with an example.  Take the cotton goods industry.\r\nIt is probably true that ninety percent of the cotton manufacturers\r\nwould agree to eliminate starvation wages, would agree to stop long\r\nhours of employment, would agree to stop child labor, would agree\r\nto prevent an overproduction that would result in unsalable\r\nsurpluses.  But, what good is such an agreement if the other ten\r\npercent of cotton manufacturers pay starvation wages, require long\r\nhours, employ children in their mills and turn out burdensome\r\nsurpluses?  The unfair ten percent could produce goods so cheaply\r\nthat the fair ninety percent would be compelled to meet the unfair\r\nconditions.  Here is where government comes in.  Government ought to\r\nhave the right and will have the right, after surveying and\r\nplanning for an industry to prevent, with the assistance of the\r\noverwhelming majority of that industry, unfair practice and to\r\nenforce this agreement by the authority of government.  The so-\r\ncalled anti-trust laws were intended to prevent the creation of\r\nmonopolies.  That purpose of the anti-trust laws must be continued,\r\nbut these laws were never intended to encourage the kind of unfair\r\ncompetition that results in long hours, starvation wages and\r\noverproduction.\r\n\r\nThe same principle applies to farm products and to transportation\r\nand every other field of organized private industry.\r\n\r\nWe are working toward a definite goal, which is to prevent the\r\nreturn of conditions which came very close to destroying what we\r\ncall modern civilization.  The actual accomplishment of our purpose\r\ncannot be attained in a day.  Our policies are wholly within\r\npurposes for which our American constitutional government was\r\nestablished 150 years ago.\r\n\r\nI know that the people of this country will understand this and\r\nwill also understand the spirit in which we are undertaking this\r\npolicy.  I do not deny that we may make mistakes of procedure as we\r\ncarry out the policy.  I have no expectation of making a hit every\r\ntime I come to bat.  What I seek is the highest possible batting\r\naverage, not only for myself but for the team.  Theodore Roosevelt\r\nonce said to me:  \"If I can be right 75 percent of the time I shall\r\ncome up to the fullest measure of my hopes.\"\r\n\r\nMuch has been said of late about federal finances and inflation,\r\nthe gold standard, etc.  Let me make the facts very simple and my\r\npolicy very clear.  In the first place, government credit and\r\ngovernment currency are really one and the same thing.  Behind\r\ngovernment bonds there is only a promise to pay.  Behind government\r\ncurrency we have, in addition to the promise to pay, a reserve of\r\ngold and a small reserve of silver.  In this connection it is worth\r\nwhile remembering that in the past the government has agreed to\r\nredeem nearly thirty billions of its debts and its currency in\r\ngold, and private corporations in this country have agreed to\r\nredeem another sixty or seventy billions of securities and\r\nmortgages in gold.  The government and private corporations were\r\nmaking these agreements when they knew full well that all of the\r\ngold in the United States amounted to only between three and four\r\nbillions and that all of the gold in all of the world amounted to\r\nonly about eleven billions.\r\n\r\nIf the holders of these promises to pay started in to demand gold\r\nthe first comers would get gold for a few days and they would\r\namount to about one twenty-fifth of the holders of the securities\r\nand the currency.  The other twenty-four people out of twenty-five,\r\nwho did not happen to be at the top of the line, would be told\r\npolitely that there was no more gold left.  We have decided to treat\r\nall twenty-five in the same way in the interest of justice and the\r\nexercise of the constitutional powers of this government.  We have\r\nplaced everyone on the same basis in order that the general good\r\nmay be preserved.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, gold, and to a partial extent silver, are perfectly\r\ngood bases for currency and that is why I decided not to let any of\r\nthe gold now in the country go out of it.\r\n\r\nA series of conditions arose three weeks ago which very readily\r\nmight have meant, first, a drain on our gold by foreign countries,\r\nand second, as a result of that, a flight of American capital, in\r\nthe form of gold, out of our country.  It is not exaggerating the\r\npossibility to tell you that such an occurrence might well have\r\ntaken from us the major part of our gold reserve and resulted in\r\nsuch a further weakening of our government and private credit as to\r\nbring on actual panic conditions and the complete stoppage of the\r\nwheels of industry.\r\n\r\nThe administration has the definite objective of raising commodity\r\nprices to such an extent that those who have borrowed money will,\r\non the average, be able to repay that money in the same kind of\r\ndollar which they borrowed.  We do not seek to let them get such a\r\ncheap dollar that they will be able to pay back a great deal less\r\nthan they borrowed.  In other words, we seek to correct a wrong and\r\nnot to create another wrong in the opposite direction.  That is why\r\npowers are being given to the administration to provide, if\r\nnecessary, for an enlargement of credit, in order to correct the\r\nexisting wrong.  These powers will be used when, as, and if it may\r\nbe necessary to accomplish the purpose.\r\n\r\nHand in hand with the domestic situation which, of course, is our\r\nfirst concern, is the world situation, and I want to emphasize to\r\nyou that the domestic situation is inevitably and deeply tied in\r\nwith the conditions in all of the other nations of the world.  In\r\nother words, we can get, in all probability, a fair measure of\r\nprosperity to return in the United States, but it will not be\r\npermanent unless we get a return to prosperity all over the world.\r\n\r\nIn the conferences which we have held and are holding with the\r\nleaders of other nations, we are seeking four great objectives:\r\nFirst, a general reduction of armaments and through this the\r\nremoval of the fear of invasion and armed attack, and, at the same\r\ntime, a reduction in armament costs, in order to help in the\r\nbalancing of government budgets and the reduction of taxation;\r\nsecond, a cutting down of the trade barriers, in order to restart\r\nthe flow of exchange of crops and goods between nations; third, the\r\nsetting up of a stabilization of currencies, in order that trade\r\ncan make contracts ahead; fourth, the reestablishment of friendly\r\nrelations and greater confidence between all nations.\r\n\r\nOur foreign visitors these past three weeks have responded to these\r\npurposes in a very helpful way.  All of the nations have suffered\r\nalike in this great depression.  They have all reached the\r\nconclusion that each can best be helped by the common action of\r\nall.  It is in this spirit that our visitors have met with us and\r\ndiscussed our common problems.  The international conference that\r\nlies before us must succeed.  The future of the world demands it and\r\nwe have each of us pledged ourselves to the best joint efforts to\r\nthis end.\r\n\r\nTo you, the people of this country, all of us, the Members of the\r\nCongress and the members of this administration, owe a profound\r\ndebt of gratitude.  Throughout the depression you have been patient.\r\nYou have granted us wide powers; you have encouraged us with a\r\nwidespread approval of our purposes.  Every ounce of strength and\r\nevery resource at our command we have devoted to the end of\r\njustifying your confidence.  We are encouraged to believe that a\r\nwise and sensible beginning has been made.  In the present spirit of\r\nmutual confidence and mutual encouragement we go forward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJuly 24, 1933.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the adjournment of the historical special session of the\r\nCongress five weeks ago I purposely refrained from addressing you\r\nfor two very good reasons.\r\n\r\nFirst, I think that we all wanted the opportunity of a little quiet\r\nthought to examine and assimilate in a mental picture the crowding\r\nevents of the hundred days which had been devoted to the starting\r\nof the wheels of the New Deal.\r\n\r\nSecondly, I wanted a few weeks in which to set up the new\r\nadministrative organization and to see the first fruits of our\r\ncareful planning.\r\n\r\nI think it will interest you if I set forth the fundamentals of\r\nthis planning for national recovery; and this I am very certain\r\nwill make it abundantly clear to you that all of the proposals and\r\nall of the legislation since the fourth day of March have not been\r\njust a collection of haphazard schemes but rather the orderly\r\ncomponent parts of a connected and logical whole.\r\n\r\nLong before inauguration day I became convinced that individual\r\neffort and local effort and even disjointed federal effort had\r\nfailed and of necessity would fail and, therefore, that a rounded\r\nleadership by the federal government had become a necessity both of\r\ntheory and of fact.  Such leadership, however, had its beginning in\r\npreserving and strengthening the credit of the United States\r\ngovernment, because without that no leadership was a possibility.\r\nFor years the government had not lived within its income.  The\r\nimmediate task was to bring our regular expenses within our\r\nrevenues.  That has been done.\r\n\r\nIt may seem inconsistent for a government to cut down its regular\r\nexpenses and at the same time to borrow and to spend billions for\r\nan emergency.  But it is not inconsistent because a large portion of\r\nthe emergency money has been paid out in the form of sound loans\r\nwhich will be repaid to the treasury over a period of years; and to\r\ncover the rest of the emergency money we have imposed taxes to pay\r\nthe interest and the installments on that part of the debt.\r\n\r\nSo you will see that we have kept our credit good.  We have built a\r\ngranite foundation in a period of confusion.  That foundation of the\r\nfederal credit stands there broad and sure.  It is the base of the\r\nwhole recovery plan.\r\n\r\nThen came the part of the problem that concerned the credit of the\r\nindividual citizens themselves.  You and I know of the banking\r\ncrisis and of the great danger to the savings of our people.  On\r\nMarch sixth every national bank was closed.  One month later 90\r\npercent of the deposits in the national banks had been made\r\navailable to the depositors.  Today only about 5 percent of the\r\ndeposits in national banks are still tied up.  The condition\r\nrelating to state banks, while not quite so good on a percentage\r\nbasis, is showing a steady reduction in the total of frozen\r\ndeposits--a result much better than we had expected three months\r\nago.\r\n\r\nThe problem of the credit of the individual was made more difficult\r\nbecause of another fact.  The dollar was a different dollar from the\r\none with which the average debt had been incurred.  For this reason\r\nlarge numbers of people were actually losing possession of and\r\ntitle to their farms and homes.  All of you know the financial steps\r\nwhich have been taken to correct this inequality.  In addition the\r\nHome Loan Act, the Farm Loan Act and the Bankruptcy Act were\r\npassed.\r\n\r\nIt was a vital necessity to restore purchasing power by reducing\r\nthe debt and interest charges upon our people, but while we were\r\nhelping people to save their credit it was at the same time\r\nabsolutely essential to do something about the physical needs of\r\nhundreds of thousands who were in dire straits at that very moment.\r\nMunicipal and state aid were being stretched to the limit.  We\r\nappropriated half a billion dollars to supplement their efforts and\r\nin addition, as you know, we have put 300,000 young men into\r\npractical and useful work in our forests and to prevent flood and\r\nsoil erosion.  The wages they earn are going in greater part to the\r\nsupport of the nearly one million people who constitute their\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\nIn this same classification we can properly place the great public\r\nworks program running to a total of over three billion dollars--to\r\nbe used for highways and ships and flood prevention and inland\r\nnavigation and thousands of self-sustaining state and municipal\r\nimprovements.  Two points should be made clear in the allotting and\r\nadministration of these projects--first, we are using the utmost\r\ncare to choose labor-creating, quick-acting, useful projects,\r\navoiding the smell of the pork barrel; and secondly, we are hoping\r\nthat at least half of the money will come back to the government\r\nfrom projects which will pay for themselves over a period of years.\r\n\r\nThus far I have spoken primarily of the foundation stones--the\r\nmeasures that were necessary to reestablish credit and to head\r\npeople in the opposite direction by preventing distress and\r\nproviding as much work as possible through governmental agencies.\r\nNow I come to the links which will build us a more lasting\r\nprosperity.  I have said that we cannot attain that in a nation half\r\nboom and half broke.  If all of our people have work and fair wages\r\nand fair profits, they can buy the products of their neighbors and\r\nbusiness is good.  But if you take away the wages and the profits of\r\nhalf of them, business is only half as good.  It doesn't help much\r\nif the fortunate half is very prosperous--the best way is for\r\neverybody to be reasonably prosperous.\r\n\r\nFor many years the two great barriers to a normal prosperity have\r\nbeen low farm prices and the creeping paralysis of unemployment.\r\nThese factors have cut the purchasing power of the country in half.\r\nI promised action.  Congress did its part when it passed the Farm\r\nand the Industrial Recovery Acts.  Today we are putting these two\r\nacts to work and they will work if people understand their plain\r\nobjectives.\r\n\r\nFirst the Farm Act:  It is based on the fact that the purchasing\r\npower of nearly half our population depends on adequate prices for\r\nfarm products.  We have been producing more of some crops than we\r\nconsume or can sell in a depressed world market.  The cure is not to\r\nproduce so much.  Without our help the farmers cannot get together\r\nand cut production, and the Farm Bill gives them a method of\r\nbringing their production down to a reasonable level and of\r\nobtaining reasonable prices for their crops.  I have clearly stated\r\nthat this method is in a sense experimental, but so far as we have\r\ngone we have reason to believe that it will produce good results.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that if we can greatly increase the purchasing power\r\nof the tens of millions of our people who make a living from\r\nfarming and the distribution of farm crops, we will greatly\r\nincrease the consumption of those goods which are turned out by\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\nThat brings me to the final step--bringing back industry along\r\nsound lines.\r\n\r\nLast Autumn, on several occasions, I expressed my faith that we can\r\nmake possible by democratic self-discipline in industry general\r\nincreases in wages and shortening of hours sufficient to enable\r\nindustry to pay its own workers enough to let those workers buy and\r\nuse the things that their labor produces.  This can be done only if\r\nwe permit and encourage cooperative action in industry because it\r\nis obvious that without united action a few selfish men in each\r\ncompetitive group will pay starvation wages and insist on long\r\nhours of work.  Others in that group must either follow suit or\r\nclose up shop.  We have seen the result of action of that kind in\r\nthe continuing descent into the economic Hell of the past four\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThere is a clear way to reverse that process:  If all employers in\r\neach competitive group agree to pay their workers the same wages--\r\nreasonable wages--and require the same hours--reasonable hours--\r\nthen higher wages and shorter hours will hurt no employer.\r\nMoreover, such action is better for the employer than unemployment\r\nand low wages, because it makes more buyers for his product.  That\r\nis the simple idea which is the very heart of the Industrial\r\nRecovery Act.\r\n\r\nOn the basis of this simple principle of everybody doing things\r\ntogether, we are starting out on this nationwide attack on\r\nunemployment.  It will succeed if our people understand it--in the\r\nbig industries, in the little shops, in the great cities and in the\r\nsmall villages.  There is nothing complicated about it and there is\r\nnothing particularly new in the principle.  It goes back to the\r\nbasic idea of society and of the nation itself that people acting\r\nin a group can accomplish things which no individual acting alone\r\ncould even hope to bring about.\r\n\r\nHere is an example.  In the Cotton Textile Code and in other\r\nagreements already signed, child labor has been abolished.  That\r\nmakes me personally happier than any other one thing with which I\r\nhave been connected since I came to Washington.  In the textile\r\nindustry--an industry which came to me spontaneously and with a\r\nsplendid cooperation as soon as the recovery act was signed--child\r\nlabor was an old evil.  But no employer acting alone was able to\r\nwipe it out.  If one employer tried it, or if one state tried it,\r\nthe costs of operation rose so high that it was impossible to\r\ncompete with the employers or states which had failed to act.  The\r\nmoment the Recovery Act was passed, this monstrous thing which\r\nneither opinion nor law could reach through years of effort went\r\nout in a flash.  As a British editorial put it, we did more under a\r\nCode in one day than they in England had been able to do under the\r\ncommon law in eighty-five years of effort.  I use this incident, my\r\nfriends, not to boast of what has already been done but to point\r\nthe way to you for even greater cooperative efforts this summer and\r\nautumn.\r\n\r\nWe are not going through another winter like the last.  I doubt if\r\never any people so bravely and cheerfully endured a season half so\r\nbitter.  We cannot ask America to continue to face such needless\r\nhardships.  It is time for courageous action, and the Recovery Bill\r\ngives us the means to conquer unemployment with exactly the same\r\nweapon that we have used to strike down child labor.\r\n\r\nThe proposition is simply this:\r\n\r\nIf all employers will act together to shorten hours and raise wages\r\nwe can put people back to work.  No employer will suffer, because\r\nthe relative level of competitive cost will advance by the same\r\namount for all.  But if any considerable group should lag or shirk,\r\nthis great opportunity will pass us by and we will go into another\r\ndesperate winter.  This must not happen.\r\n\r\nWe have sent out to all employers an agreement which is the result\r\nof weeks of consultation.  This agreement checks against the\r\nvoluntary codes of nearly all the large industries which have\r\nalready been submitted.  This blanket agreement carries the\r\nunanimous approval of the three boards which I have appointed to\r\nadvise in this, boards representing the great leaders in labor, in\r\nindustry and in social service.  The agreement has already brought a\r\nflood of approval from every state, and from so wide a cross-\r\nsection of the common calling of industry that I know it is fair\r\nfor all.  It is a plan--deliberate, reasonable and just--intended to\r\nput into effect at once the most important of the broad principles\r\nwhich are being established, industry by industry, through codes.\r\nNaturally, it takes a good deal of organizing and a great many\r\nhearings and many months, to get these codes perfected and signed,\r\nand we cannot wait for all of them to go through.  The blanket\r\nagreements, however, which I am sending to every employer will\r\nstart the wheels turning now, and not six months from now.\r\n\r\nThere are, of course, men, a few of them who might thwart this\r\ngreat common purpose by seeking selfish advantage.  There are\r\nadequate penalties in the law, but I am now asking the cooperation\r\nthat comes from opinion and from conscience.  These are the only\r\ninstruments we shall use in this great summer offensive against\r\nunemployment.  But we shall use them to the limit to protect the\r\nwilling from the laggard and to make the plan succeed.\r\n\r\nIn war, in the gloom of night attack, soldiers wear a bright badge\r\non their shoulders to be sure that comrades do not fire on\r\ncomrades.  On that principle, those who cooperate in this program\r\nmust know each other at a glance.  That is why we have provided a\r\nbadge of honor for this purpose, a simple design with a legend.  \"We\r\ndo our part,\" and I ask that all those who join with me shall\r\ndisplay that badge prominently.  It is essential to our purpose.\r\n\r\nAlready all the great, basic industries have come forward willingly\r\nwith proposed codes, and in these codes they accept the principles\r\nleading to mass reemployment.  But, important as is this heartening\r\ndemonstration, the richest field for results is among the small\r\nemployers, those whose contribution will give new work for from one\r\nto ten people.  These smaller employers are indeed a vital part of\r\nthe backbone of the country, and the success of our plans lies\r\nlargely in their hands.\r\n\r\nAlready the telegrams and letters are pouring into the White\r\nHouse--messages from employers who ask that their names be placed\r\non this special Roll of Honor.  They represent great corporations\r\nand companies, and partnerships and individuals.  I ask that even\r\nbefore the dates set in the agreements which we have sent out, the\r\nemployers of the country who have not already done so--the big\r\nfellows and the little fellows--shall at once write or telegraph to\r\nme personally at the White House, expressing their intention of\r\ngoing through with the plan.  And it is my purpose to keep posted in\r\nthe post office of every town, a Roll of Honor of all those who\r\njoin with me.\r\n\r\nI want to take this occasion to say to the twenty-four governors\r\nwho are now in conference in San Francisco, that nothing thus far\r\nhas helped in strengthening this great movement more than their\r\nresolutions adopted at the very outset of their meeting, giving\r\nthis plan their unanimous and instant approval, and pledging to\r\nsupport it in their states.\r\n\r\nTo the men and women whose lives have been darkened by the fact or\r\nthe fear of unemployment, I am justified in saying a word of\r\nencouragement because the codes and the agreements already\r\napproved, or about to be passed upon, prove that the plan does\r\nraise wages, and that it does put people back to work.  You can look\r\non every employer who adopts the plan as one who is doing his part,\r\nand those employers deserve well of everyone who works for a\r\nliving.  It will be clear to you, as it is to me, that while the\r\nshirking employer may undersell his competitor, the saving he thus\r\nmakes is made at the expense of his country's welfare.\r\n\r\nWhile we are making this great common effort there should be no\r\ndiscord and dispute.  This is no time to cavil or to question the\r\nstandard set by this universal agreement.  It is time for patience\r\nand understanding and cooperation.  The workers of this country have\r\nrights under this law which cannot be taken from them, and nobody\r\nwill be permitted to whittle them away, but, on the other hand, no\r\naggression is now necessary to attain those rights.  The whole\r\ncountry will be united to get them for you.  The principle that\r\napplies to the employers applies to the workers as well, and I ask\r\nyou workers to cooperate in the same spirit.\r\n\r\nWhen Andrew Jackson, \"Old Hickory,\" died, someone asked, \"Will he\r\ngo to Heaven?\" and the answer was, \"He will if he wants to.\"  If I\r\nam asked whether the American people will pull themselves out of\r\nthis depression, I answer, \"They will if they want to.\"  The essence\r\nof the plan is a universal limitation of hours of work per week for\r\nany individual by common consent, and a universal payment of wages\r\nabove a minimum, also by common consent.  I cannot guarantee the\r\nsuccess of this nationwide plan, but the people of this country can\r\nguarantee its success.  I have no faith in \"cure-alls\" but I believe\r\nthat we can greatly influence economic forces.  I have no sympathy\r\nwith the professional economists who insist that things must run\r\ntheir course and that human agencies can have no influence on\r\neconomic ills.  One reason is that I happen to know that\r\nprofessional economists have changed their definition of economic\r\nlaws every five or ten years for a very long time, but I do have\r\nfaith, and retain faith, in the strength of common purpose, and in\r\nthe strength of unified action taken by the American people.\r\n\r\nThat is why I am describing to you the simple purposes and the\r\nsolid foundations upon which our program of recovery is built.  That\r\nis why I am asking the employers of the nation to sign this common\r\ncovenant with me--to sign it in the name of patriotism and\r\nhumanity.  That is why I am asking the workers to go along with us\r\nin a spirit of understanding and of helpfulness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOctober 22,1933.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is three months since I have talked with the people of this\r\ncountry about our national problems; but during this period many\r\nthings have happened, and I am glad to say that the major part of\r\nthem have greatly helped the well-being of the average citizen.\r\n\r\nBecause, in every step which your government is taking we are\r\nthinking in terms of the average of you--in the old words, \"the\r\ngreatest good to the greatest number\"--we, as reasonable people,\r\ncannot expect to bring definite benefits to every person or to\r\nevery occupation or business, or industry or agriculture.  In the\r\nsame way, no reasonable person can expect that in this short space\r\nof time, during which new machinery had to be not only put to work,\r\nbut first set up, that every locality in every one of the forty-\r\neight states of the country could share equally and simultaneously\r\nin the trend to better times.\r\n\r\nThe whole picture, however--the average of the whole territory from\r\ncoast to coast--the average of the whole population of 120,000,000\r\npeople--shows to any person willing to look, facts and action of\r\nwhich you and I can be proud.\r\n\r\nIn the early spring of this year there were actually and\r\nproportionately more people out of work in this country than in any\r\nother nation in the world.  Fair estimates showed twelve or thirteen\r\nmillions unemployed last March.  Among those there were, of course,\r\nseveral millions who could be classed as normally unemployed--\r\npeople who worked occasionally when they felt like it, and others\r\nwho preferred not to work at all.  It seems, therefore, fair to say\r\nthat there were about 10 millions of our citizens who earnestly,\r\nand in many cases hungrily, were seeking work and could not get it.\r\nOf these, in the short space of a few months, I am convinced that\r\nat least 4 millions have been given employment--or, saying it\r\nanother way, 40 percent of those seeking work have found it.\r\n\r\nThat does not mean, my friends, that I am satisfied, or that you\r\nare satisfied that our work is ended.  We have a long way to go but\r\nwe are on the way.\r\n\r\nHow are we constructing the edifice of recovery--the temple which,\r\nwhen completed, will no longer be a temple of money-changers or of\r\nbeggars, but rather a temple dedicated to and maintained for a\r\ngreater social justice, a greater welfare for America--the\r\nhabitation of a sound economic life?  We are building, stone by\r\nstone, the columns which will support that habitation.  Those\r\ncolumns are many in number and though, for a moment the progress of\r\none column may disturb the progress on the pillar next to it, the\r\nwork on all of them must proceed without let or hindrance.\r\n\r\nWe all know that immediate relief for the unemployed was the first\r\nessential of such a structure and that is why I speak first of the\r\nfact that three hundred thousand young men have been given\r\nemployment and are being given employment all through this winter\r\nin the Civilian Conservation Corps Camps in almost every part of\r\nthe nation.\r\n\r\nSo, too, we have, as you know, expended greater sums in cooperation\r\nwith states and localities for work relief and home relief than\r\never before--sums which during the coming winter cannot be lessened\r\nfor the very simple reason that though several million people have\r\ngone back to work, the necessities of those who have not yet\r\nobtained work is more severe than at this time last year.\r\n\r\nThen we come to the relief that is being given to those who are in\r\ndanger of losing their farms or their homes.  New machinery had to\r\nbe set up for farm credit and for home credit in every one of the\r\nthirty-one hundred counties of the United States, and every day\r\nthat passes is saving homes and farms to hundreds of families.  I\r\nhave publicly asked that foreclosures on farms and chattels and on\r\nhomes be delayed until every mortgagor in the country shall have\r\nhad full opportunity to take advantage of federal credit.  I make\r\nthe further request which many of you know has already been made\r\nthrough the great federal credit organizations that if there is any\r\nfamily in the United States about to lose its home or about to lose\r\nits chattels, that family should telegraph at once either to the\r\nFarm Credit Administration or the Home Owners Loan Corporation in\r\nWashington requesting their help.\r\n\r\nTwo other great agencies are in full swing.  The Reconstruction\r\nFinance Corporation continues to lend large sums to industry and\r\nfinance with the definite objective of making easy the extending of\r\ncredit to industry, commerce and finance.\r\n\r\nThe program of public works in three months has advanced to this\r\npoint:  Out of a total appropriated for public works of three\r\nbillion three hundred million, one billion eight hundred million\r\nhas already been allocated to federal projects of all kinds and\r\nliterally in every part of the United States and work on these is\r\nstarting forward.  In addition, three hundred millions have been\r\nallocated to public works to be carried out by states,\r\nmunicipalities and private organizations, such as those undertaking\r\nslum clearance.  The balance of the public works money, nearly all\r\nof it intended for state or local projects, waits only on the\r\npresentation of proper projects by the states and localities\r\nthemselves.  Washington has the money and is waiting for the proper\r\nprojects to which to allot it.\r\n\r\nAnother pillar in the making is the Agricultural Adjustment\r\nAdministration.  I have been amazed by the extraordinary degree of\r\ncooperation given to the government by the cotton farmers in the\r\nSouth, the wheat farmers of the West, the tobacco farmers of the\r\nSoutheast, and I am confident that the corn-hog farmers of the\r\nMiddle West will come through in the same magnificent fashion.  The\r\nproblem we seek to solve had been steadily getting worse for twenty\r\nyears, but during the last six months we have made more rapid\r\nprogress than any nation has ever made in a like period of time.  It\r\nis true that in July farm commodity prices had been pushed up\r\nhigher than they are today, but that push came in part from pure\r\nspeculation by people who could not tell you the difference between\r\nwheat and rye, by people who had never seen cotton growing, by\r\npeople who did not know that hogs were fed on corn--people who have\r\nno real interest in the farmer and his problems.\r\n\r\nIn spite, however, of the speculative reaction from the speculative\r\nadvance, it seems to be well established that during the course of\r\nthe year 1933 the farmers of the United States will receive 33\r\npercent more dollars for what they have produced than they received\r\nin the year 1932.  Put in another way, they will receive $400 in\r\n1933, where they received $300 the year before.  That, remember, is\r\nfor the average of the country, for I have reports that some\r\nsections are not any better off than they were a year ago.  This\r\napplies among the major products, especially to cattle raising and\r\nthe dairy industry.  We are going after those problems as fast as we\r\ncan.\r\n\r\nI do not hesitate to say, in the simplest, clearest language of\r\nwhich I am capable, that although the prices of many products of\r\nthe farm have gone up and although many farm families are better\r\noff than they were last year, I am not satisfied either with the\r\namount or the extent of the rise, and that it is definitely a part\r\nof our policy to increase the rise and to extend it to those\r\nproducts which have as yet felt no benefit.  If we cannot do this\r\none way we will do it another.  Do it, we will.\r\n\r\nStanding beside the pillar of the farm--the A.A.A.--is the pillar\r\nof industry--the N.R.A.  Its object is to put industry and business\r\nworkers into employment and to increase their purchasing power\r\nthrough increased wages.\r\n\r\nIt has abolished child labor.  It has eliminated the sweat shop.  It\r\nhas ended sixty cents a week paid in some mills and eighty cents a\r\nweek paid in some mines.  The measure of the growth of this pillar\r\nlies in the total figures of reemployment which I have already\r\ngiven you and in the fact that reemployment is continuing and not\r\nstopping.  The secret of N.R.A. is cooperation.  That cooperation has\r\nbeen voluntarily given through the signing of the blanket codes and\r\nthrough the signing of specific codes which already include all of\r\nthe greater industries of the nation.\r\n\r\nIn the vast majority of cases, in the vast majority of localities--\r\nthe N.R.A. has been given support in unstinted measure.  We know\r\nthat there are chiselers.  At the bottom of every case of criticism\r\nand obstruction we have found some selfish interest, some private\r\nax to grind.\r\n\r\nNinety percent of complaints come from misconception.  For example,\r\nit has been said that N.R.A. has failed to raise the price of wheat\r\nand corn and hogs; that N.R.A. has not loaned enough money for\r\nlocal public works.  Of course, N.R.A. has nothing whatsoever to do\r\nwith the price of farm products, nor with public works.  It has to\r\ndo only with industrial organization for economic planning to wipe\r\nout unfair practices and to create reemployment.  Even in the field\r\nof business and industry, N.R.A. does not apply to the rural\r\ncommunities or to towns of under twenty-five hundred population,\r\nexcept in so far as those towns contain factories or chain stores\r\nwhich come under a specific code.\r\n\r\nIt is also true that among the chiselers to whom I have referred,\r\nthere are not only the big chiselers but also petty chiselers who\r\nseek to make undue profit on untrue statements.\r\n\r\nLet me cite to you the example of the salesman in a store in a\r\nlarge Eastern city who tried to justify the increase in the price\r\nof a cotton shirt from one dollar and a half to two dollars and a\r\nhalf by saying to the customer that it was due to the cotton\r\nprocessing tax.  Actually in that shirt there was about one pound of\r\ncotton and the processing tax amounted to four and a quarter cents\r\non that pound of cotton.\r\n\r\nAt this point it is only fair that I should give credit to the\r\nsixty or seventy million people who live in the cities and larger\r\ntowns of the nation for their understanding and their willingness\r\nto go along with the payment of even these small processing taxes,\r\nthough they know full well that the proportion of the processing\r\ntaxes on cotton goods and on food products paid for by city\r\ndwellers goes 100 percent towards increasing the agricultural\r\nincome of the farm dwellers of the land.\r\n\r\nThe last pillar of which I speak is that of the money of the\r\ncountry in the banks of the country.  There are two simple facts.\r\n\r\nFirst, the federal government is about to spend one billion dollars\r\nas an immediate loan on the frozen or non-liquid assets of all\r\nbanks closed since January 1, 1933, giving a liberal appraisal to\r\nthose assets.  This money will be in the hands of the depositors as\r\nquickly as it is humanly possible to get it out.\r\n\r\nSecond, the Government Bank Deposit Insurance on all accounts up to\r\n$2500 goes into effect on January first.  We are now engaged in\r\nseeing to it that on or before that date the banking capital\r\nstructure will be built up by the government to the point that the\r\nbanks will be in sound condition when the insurance goes into\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nFinally, I repeat what I have said on many occasions, that ever\r\nsince last March the definite policy of the government has been to\r\nrestore commodity price levels.  The object has been the attainment\r\nof such a level as will enable agriculture and industry once more\r\nto give work to the unemployed.  It has been to make possible the\r\npayment of public and private debts more nearly at the price level\r\nat which they were incurred.  It has been gradually to restore a\r\nbalance in the price structure so that farmers may exchange their\r\nproducts for the products of industry on a fairer exchange basis.\r\nIt has been and is also the purpose to prevent prices from rising\r\nbeyond the point necessary to attain these ends.  The permanent\r\nwelfare and security of every class of our people ultimately\r\ndepends on our attainment of these purposes.\r\n\r\nObviously, and because hundreds of different kinds of crops and\r\nindustrial occupations in the huge territory that makes up this\r\nNation are involved, we cannot reach the goal in only a few months.\r\nWe may take one year or two years or three years.\r\n\r\nNo one who considers the plain facts of our situation believes that\r\ncommodity prices, especially agricultural prices, are high enough\r\nyet.\r\n\r\nSome people are putting the cart before the horse.  They want a\r\npermanent revaluation of the dollar first.  It is the government's\r\npolicy to restore the price level first.  I would not know, and no\r\none else could tell, just what the permanent valuation of the\r\ndollar will be.  To guess at a permanent gold valuation now would\r\ncertainly require later changes caused by later facts.\r\n\r\nWhen we have restored the price level, we shall seek to establish\r\nand maintain a dollar which will not change its purchasing and debt\r\npaying power during the succeeding generation.  I said that in my\r\nmessage to the American delegation in London last July.  And I say\r\nit now once more.\r\n\r\nBecause of conditions in this country and because of events beyond\r\nour control in other parts of the world, it becomes increasingly\r\nimportant to develop and apply the further measures which may be\r\nnecessary from time to time to control the gold value of our own\r\ndollar at home.\r\n\r\nOur dollar is now altogether too greatly influenced by the\r\naccidents of international trade, by the internal policies of other\r\nnations and by political disturbance in other continents.  Therefore\r\nthe United States must take firmly in its own hands the control of\r\nthe gold value of our dollar.  This is necessary in order to prevent\r\ndollar disturbances from swinging us away from our ultimate goal,\r\nnamely, the continued recovery of our commodity prices.\r\n\r\nAs a further effective means to this end, I am going to establish a\r\ngovernment market for gold in the United States.  Therefore, under\r\nthe clearly defined authority of existing law, I am authorizing the\r\nReconstruction Finance Corporation to buy gold newly mined in the\r\nUnited States at prices to be determined from time to time after\r\nconsultation with the Secretary of the Treasury and the President.\r\nWhenever necessary to the end in view, we shall also buy or sell\r\ngold in the world market.\r\n\r\nMy aim in taking this step is to establish and maintain continuous\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\nThis is a policy and not an expedient.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be used merely to offset a temporary fall in prices.\r\nWe are thus continuing to move towards a managed currency.\r\n\r\nYou will recall the dire predictions made last spring by those who\r\ndid not agree with our common policies of raising prices by direct\r\nmeans.  What actually happened stood out in sharp contrast with\r\nthose predictions.  Government credit is high, prices have risen in\r\npart.  Doubtless prophets of evil still exist in our midst.  But\r\ngovernment credit will be maintained and a sound currency will\r\naccompany a rise in the American commodity price level.\r\n\r\nI have told you tonight the story of our steady but sure work in\r\nbuilding our common recovery.  In my promises to you both before and\r\nafter March 4th, I made two things plain:  First, that I pledged no\r\nmiracles and, second, that I would do my best.\r\n\r\nI thank you for your patience and your faith.  Our troubles will not\r\nbe over tomorrow, but we are on our way and we are headed in the\r\nright direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJune 28, 1934.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been several months since I have talked with you concerning\r\nthe problems of government.  Since January, those of us in whom you\r\nhave vested responsibility have been engaged in the fulfillment of\r\nplans and policies which had been widely discussed in previous\r\nmonths.  It seemed to us our duty not only to make the right path\r\nclear but also to tread that path.\r\n\r\nAs we review the achievements of this session of the Seventy-third\r\nCongress, it is made increasingly clear that its task was\r\nessentially that of completing and fortifying the work it had begun\r\nin March, l933.  That was no easy task, but the Congress was equal\r\nto it.  It has been well said that while there were a few\r\nexceptions, this Congress displayed a greater freedom from mere\r\npartisanship than any other peace-time Congress since the\r\nadministration of President Washington himself.  The session was\r\ndistinguished by the extent and variety of legislation enacted and\r\nby the intelligence and good will of debate upon these measures.\r\n\r\nI mention only a few of the major enactments.  It provided for the\r\nreadjustment of the debt burden through the corporate and municipal\r\nbankruptcy acts and the Farm Relief Act.  It lent a hand to industry\r\nby encouraging loans to solvent industries unable to secure\r\nadequate help from banking institutions.  It strengthened the\r\nintegrity of finance through the regulation of securities\r\nexchanges.  It provided a rational method of increasing our volume\r\nof foreign trade through reciprocal trading agreements.  It\r\nstrengthened our naval forces to conform with the intentions and\r\npermission of existing treaty rights.  It made further advances\r\ntowards peace in industry through the Labor Adjustment Act.  It\r\nsupplemented our agricultural policy through measures widely\r\ndemanded by farmers themselves and intended to avert price\r\ndestroying surpluses.  It strengthened the hand of the federal\r\ngovernment in its attempts to suppress gangster crime.  It took\r\ndefinite steps towards a national housing program through an act\r\nwhich I signed today designed to encourage private capital in the\r\nrebuilding of the homes of the nation.  It created a permanent\r\nfederal body for the just regulation of all forms of communication,\r\nincluding the telephone, the telegraph and the radio.  Finally, and\r\nI believe most important, it reorganized, simplified and made more\r\nfair and just our monetary system, setting up standards and\r\npolicies adequate to meet the necessities of modern economic life,\r\ndoing justice to both gold and silver as the metal bases behind the\r\ncurrency of the United States.\r\n\r\nIn the consistent development of our previous efforts toward the\r\nsaving and safeguarding of our national life, I have continued to\r\nrecognize three related steps.  The first was relief, because the\r\nprimary concern of any government dominated by the humane ideals of\r\ndemocracy is the simple principle that in a land of vast resources\r\nno one should be permitted to starve.  Relief was and continues to\r\nbe our first consideration.  It calls for large expenditures and\r\nwill continue in modified form to do so for a long time to come.  We\r\nmay as well recognize that fact.  It comes from the paralysis that\r\narose as the after-effect of that unfortunate decade characterized\r\nby a mad chase for unearned riches and an unwillingness of leaders\r\nin almost every walk of life to look beyond their own schemes and\r\nspeculations.  In our administration of relief we follow two\r\nprinciples:  First, that direct giving shall, wherever possible, be\r\nsupplemented by provision for useful and remunerative work and,\r\nsecond, that where families in their existing surroundings will in\r\nall human probability never find an opportunity for full self-\r\nmaintenance, happiness and enjoyment, we will try to give them a\r\nnew chance in new surroundings.\r\n\r\nThe second step was recovery, and it is sufficient for me to ask\r\neach and every one of you to compare the situation in agriculture\r\nand in industry today with what it was fifteen months ago.\r\n\r\nAt the same time we have recognized the necessity of reform and\r\nreconstruction--reform because much of our trouble today and in the\r\npast few years has been due to a lack of understanding of the\r\nelementary principles of justice and fairness by those in whom\r\nleadership in business and finance was placed--reconstruction\r\nbecause new conditions in our economic life as well as old but\r\nneglected conditions had to be corrected.\r\n\r\nSubstantial gains well known to all of you have justified our\r\ncourse.  I could cite statistics to you as unanswerable measures of\r\nour national progress--statistics to show the gain in the average\r\nweekly pay envelope of workers in the great majority of\r\nindustries--statistics to show hundreds of thousands reemployed in\r\nprivate industries and other hundreds of thousands given new\r\nemployment through the expansion of direct and indirect government\r\nassistance of many kinds, although, of course, there are those\r\nexceptions in professional pursuits whose economic improvement, of\r\nnecessity, will be delayed.  I also could cite statistics to show\r\nthe great rise in the value of farm products--statistics to prove\r\nthe demand for consumers' goods, ranging all the way from food and\r\nclothing to automobiles, and of late to prove the rise in the\r\ndemand for durable goods--statistics to cover the great increase in\r\nbank deposits and to show the scores of thousands of homes and of\r\nfarms which have been saved from foreclosure.\r\n\r\nBut the simplest way for each of you to judge recovery lies in the\r\nplain facts of your own individual situation.  Are you better off\r\nthan you were last year?  Are your debts less burdensome?  Is your\r\nbank account more secure?  Are your working conditions better?  Is\r\nyour faith in your own individual future more firmly grounded?\r\n\r\nAlso, let me put to you another simple question:  Have you as an\r\nindividual paid too high a price for these gains?  Plausible self-\r\nseekers and theoretical die-hards will tell you of the loss of\r\nindividual liberty.  Answer this question also out of the facts of\r\nyour own life.  Have you lost any of your rights or liberty or\r\nconstitutional freedom of action and choice?  Turn to the Bill of\r\nRights of the Constitution, which I have solemnly sworn to maintain\r\nand under which your freedom rests secure.  Read each provision of\r\nthat Bill of Rights and ask yourself whether you personally have\r\nsuffered the impairment of a single jot of these great assurances.\r\nI have no question in my mind as to what your answer will be.  The\r\nrecord is written in the experiences of your own personal lives.\r\n\r\nIn other words, it is not the overwhelming majority of the farmers\r\nor manufacturers or workers who deny the substantial gains of the\r\npast year.  The most vociferous of the Doubting Thomases may be\r\ndivided roughly into two groups:  First, those who seek special\r\npolitical privilege and, second, those who seek special financial\r\nprivilege.  About a year ago I used as an illustration the 90\r\npercent of the cotton manufacturers of the United States who wanted\r\nto do the right thing by their employees and by the public but were\r\nprevented from doing so by the 10 percent who undercut them by\r\nunfair practices and un-American standards.  It is well for us to\r\nremember that humanity is a long way from being perfect and that a\r\nselfish minority in every walk of life--farming, business, finance\r\nand even government service itself--will always continue to think\r\nof themselves first and their fellow-beings second.\r\n\r\nIn the working out of a great national program which seeks the\r\nprimary good of the greater number, it is true that the toes of\r\nsome people are being stepped on and are going to be stepped on.\r\nBut these toes belong to the comparative few who seek to retain or\r\nto gain position or riches or both by some short cut which is\r\nharmful to the greater good.\r\n\r\nIn the execution of the powers conferred on it by Congress, the\r\nadministration needs and will tirelessly seek the best ability that\r\nthe country affords.  Public service offers better rewards in the\r\nopportunity for service than ever before in our history--not great\r\nsalaries, but enough to live on.  In the building of this service\r\nthere are coming to us men and women with ability and courage from\r\nevery part of the Union.  The days of the seeking of mere party\r\nadvantage through the misuse of public power are drawing to a\r\nclose.  We are increasingly demanding and getting devotion to the\r\npublic service on the part of every member of the administration,\r\nhigh and low.\r\n\r\nThe program of the past year is definitely in operation and that\r\noperation month by month is being made to fit into the web of old\r\nand new conditions.  This process of evolution is well illustrated\r\nby the constant changes in detailed organization and method going\r\non in the National Recovery Administration.  With every passing\r\nmonth we are making strides in the orderly handling of the\r\nrelationship between employees and employers.  Conditions differ, of\r\ncourse, in almost every part of the country and in almost every\r\nindustry.  Temporary methods of adjustment are being replaced by\r\nmore permanent machinery and, I am glad to say, by a growing\r\nrecognition on the part of employers and employees of the\r\ndesirability of maintaining fair relationships all around.\r\n\r\nSo also, while almost everybody has recognized the tremendous\r\nstrides in the elimination of child labor, in the payment of not\r\nless than fair minimum wages and in the shortening of hours, we are\r\nstill feeling our way in solving problems which relate to self-\r\ngovernment in industry, especially where such self-government tends\r\nto eliminate the fair operation of competition.\r\n\r\nIn this same process of evolution we are keeping before us the\r\nobjectives of protecting on the one hand industry against chiselers\r\nwithin its own ranks, and on the other hand the consumer through\r\nthe maintenance of reasonable competition for the prevention of the\r\nunfair sky-rocketing of retail prices.\r\n\r\nBut, in addition to this our immediate task, we must still look to\r\nthe larger future.  I have pointed out to the Congress that we are\r\nseeking to find the way once more to well-known, long-established\r\nbut to some degree forgotten ideals and values.  We seek the\r\nsecurity of the men, women and children of the nation.\r\n\r\nThat security involves added means of providing better homes for\r\nthe people of the nation.  That is the first principle of our future\r\nprogram.\r\n\r\nThe second is to plan the use of land and water resources of this\r\ncountry to the end that the means of livelihood of our citizens may\r\nbe more adequate to meet their daily needs.\r\n\r\nAnd, finally, the third principle is to use the agencies of\r\ngovernment to assist in the establishment of means to provide sound\r\nand adequate protection against the vicissitudes of modern life--in\r\nother words, social insurance.\r\n\r\nLater in the year I hope to talk with you more fully about these\r\nplans.\r\n\r\nA few timid people, who fear progress, will try to give you new and\r\nstrange names for what we are doing.  Sometimes they will call it\r\n\"Fascism\", sometimes \"Communism\", sometimes \"Regimentation\",\r\nsometimes \"Socialism\".  But, in so doing, they are trying to make\r\nvery complex and theoretical something that is really very simple\r\nand very practical.\r\n\r\nI believe in practical explanations and in practical policies.  I\r\nbelieve that what we are doing today is a necessary fulfillment of\r\nwhat Americans have always been doing--a fulfillment of old and\r\ntested American ideals.\r\n\r\nLet me give you a simple illustration:\r\n\r\nWhile I am away from Washington this summer, a long needed\r\nrenovation of and addition to our White House office building is to\r\nbe started.  The architects have planned a few new rooms built into\r\nthe present all too small one-story structure.  We are going to\r\ninclude in this addition and in this renovation modern electric\r\nwiring and modern plumbing and modern means of keeping the offices\r\ncool in the hot Washington summers.  But the structural lines of the\r\nold Executive Office Building will remain.  The artistic lines of\r\nthe White House buildings were the creation of master builders when\r\nour Republic was young.  The simplicity and the strength of the\r\nstructure remain in the face of every modern test.  But within this\r\nmagnificent pattern, the necessities of modern government business\r\nrequire constant reorganization and rebuilding.\r\n\r\nIf I were to listen to the arguments of some prophets of calamity\r\nwho are talking these days, I should hesitate to make these\r\nalterations.  I should fear that while I am away for a few weeks the\r\narchitects might build some strange new Gothic tower or a factory\r\nbuilding or perhaps a replica of the Kremlin or of the Potsdam\r\nPalace.  But I have no such fears.  The architects and builders are\r\nmen of common sense and of artistic American tastes.  They know that\r\nthe principles of harmony and of necessity itself require that the\r\nbuilding of the new structure shall blend with the essential lines\r\nof the old.  It is this combination of the old and the new that\r\nmarks orderly peaceful progress--not only in building buildings but\r\nin building government itself.\r\n\r\nOur new structure is a part of and a fulfillment of the old.\r\n\r\nAll that we do seeks to fulfill the historic traditions of the\r\nAmerican people.  Other nations may sacrifice democracy for the\r\ntransitory stimulation of old and discredited autocracies.  We are\r\nrestoring confidence and well-being under the rule of the people\r\nthemselves.  We remain, as John Marshall said a century ago,\r\n\"emphatically and truly, a government of the people.\"  Our\r\ngovernment \"in form and in substance. . . emanates from them.  Its\r\npowers are granted by them, and are to be exercised directly on\r\nthem, and for their benefits.\"\r\n\r\nBefore I close, I want to tell you of the interest and pleasure\r\nwith which I look forward to the trip on which I hope to start in a\r\nfew days.  It is a good thing for everyone who can possibly do so to\r\nget away at least once a year for a change of scene.  I do not want\r\nto get into the position of not being able to see the forest\r\nbecause of the thickness of the trees.\r\n\r\nI hope to visit our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico, in the Virgin\r\nIslands, in the Canal Zone and in Hawaii.  And, incidentally, it\r\nwill give me an opportunity to exchange a friendly word of greeting\r\nto the Presidents of our sister Republics:  Haiti, Colombia and\r\nPanama.\r\n\r\nAfter four weeks on board ship, I plan to land at a port in our\r\nPacific northwest, and then will come the best part of the whole\r\ntrip, for I am hoping to inspect a number of our new great national\r\nprojects on the Columbia, Missouri and Mississippi Rivers, to see\r\nsome of our national parks and, incidentally, to learn much of\r\nactual conditions during the trip across the continent back to\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nWhile I was in France during the War our boys used to call the\r\nUnited States \"God's country\".  Let us make it and keep it \"God's\r\ncountry\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSeptember 30, 1934.\r\n\r\n\r\nThree months have passed since I talked with you shortly after the\r\nadjournment of the Congress.  Tonight I continue that report,\r\nthough, because of the shortness of time, I must defer a number of\r\nsubjects to a later date.\r\n\r\nRecently the most notable public questions that have concerned us\r\nall have had to do with industry and labor and with respect to\r\nthese, certain developments have taken place which I consider of\r\nimportance.  I am happy to report that after years of uncertainty,\r\nculminating in the collapse of the spring of 1933, we are bringing\r\norder out of the old chaos with a greater certainty of the\r\nemployment of labor at a reasonable wage and of more business at a\r\nfair profit.  These governmental and industrial developments hold\r\npromise of new achievements for the nation.\r\n\r\nMen may differ as to the particular form of governmental activity\r\nwith respect to industry and business, but nearly all are agreed\r\nthat private enterprise in times such as these cannot be left\r\nwithout assistance and without reasonable safeguards lest it\r\ndestroy not only itself but also our processes of civilization.  The\r\nunderlying necessity for such activity is indeed as strong now as\r\nit was years ago when Elihu Root said the following very\r\nsignificant words:\r\n\r\n\"Instead of the give and take of free individual contract, the\r\ntremendous power of organization has combined great aggregations of\r\ncapital in enormous industrial establishments working through vast\r\nagencies of commerce and employing great masses of men in movements\r\nof production and transportation and trade, so great in the mass\r\nthat each individual concerned in them is quite helpless by\r\nhimself.  The relations between the employer and the employed,\r\nbetween the owners of aggregated capital and the units of organized\r\nlabor, between the small producer, the small trader, the consumer,\r\nand the great transporting and manufacturing and distributing\r\nagencies, all present new questions for the solution of which the\r\nold reliance upon the free action of individual wills appears quite\r\ninadequate.  And in many directions, the intervention of that\r\norganized control which we call government seems necessary to\r\nproduce the same result of justice and right conduct which obtained\r\nthrough the attrition of individuals before the new conditions\r\narose.\"\r\n\r\nIt was in this spirit thus described by Secretary Root that we\r\napproached our task of reviving private enterprise in March, 1933.\r\nOur first problem was, of course, the banking situation because, as\r\nyou know, the banks had collapsed.  Some banks could not be saved\r\nbut the great majority of them, either through their own resources\r\nor with government aid, have been restored to complete public\r\nconfidence.  This has given safety to millions of depositors in\r\nthese banks.  Closely following this great constructive effort we\r\nhave, through various federal agencies, saved debtors and creditors\r\nalike in many other fields of enterprise, such as loans on farm\r\nmortgages and home mortgages; loans to the railroads and insurance\r\ncompanies and, finally, help for home owners and industry itself.\r\n\r\nIn all of these efforts the government has come to the assistance\r\nof business and with the full expectation that the money used to\r\nassist these enterprises will eventually be repaid.  I believe it\r\nwill be.\r\n\r\nThe second step we have taken in the restoration of normal business\r\nenterprise has been to clean up thoroughly unwholesome conditions\r\nin the field of investment.  In this we have had assistance from\r\nmany bankers and businessmen, most of whom recognize the past evils\r\nin the banking system, in the sale of securities, in the deliberate\r\nencouragement of stock gambling, in the sale of unsound mortgages\r\nand in many other ways in which the public lost billions of\r\ndollars.  They saw that without changes in the policies and methods\r\nof investment there could be no recovery of public confidence in\r\nthe security of savings.  The country now enjoys the safety of bank\r\nsavings under the new banking laws, the careful checking of new\r\nsecurities under the Securities Act and the curtailment of rank\r\nstock speculation through the Securities Exchange Act.  I sincerely\r\nhope that as a result people will be discouraged in unhappy efforts\r\nto get rich quick by speculating in securities.  The average person\r\nalmost always loses.  Only a very small minority of the people of\r\nthis country believe in gambling as a substitute for the old\r\nphilosophy of Benjamin Franklin that the way to wealth is through\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nIn meeting the problems of industrial recovery the chief agency of\r\nthe government has been the National Recovery Administration.  Under\r\nits guidance, trades and industries covering over 90 percent of all\r\nindustrial employees have adopted codes of fair competition, which\r\nhave been approved by the President.  Under these codes, in the\r\nindustries covered, child labor has been eliminated.  The work day\r\nand the work week have been shortened.  Minimum wages have been\r\nestablished and other wages adjusted toward a rising standard of\r\nliving.  The emergency purpose of the N.R.A. was to put men to work\r\nand since its creation more than four million persons have been\r\nreemployed, in great part through the cooperation of American\r\nbusiness brought about under the codes.\r\n\r\nBenefits of the Industrial Recovery Program have come, not only to\r\nlabor in the form of new jobs, in relief from overwork and in\r\nrelief from underpay, but also to the owners and managers of\r\nindustry because, together with a great increase in the payrolls,\r\nthere has come a substantial rise in the total of industrial\r\nprofits--a rise from a deficit figure in the first quarter of 1933\r\nto a level of sustained profits within one year from the\r\ninauguration of N.R.A.\r\n\r\nNow it should not be expected that even employed labor and capital\r\nwould be completely satisfied with present conditions.  Employed\r\nworkers have not by any means all enjoyed a return to the earnings\r\nof prosperous times, although millions of hitherto underprivileged\r\nworkers are today far better paid than ever before.  Also, billions\r\nof dollars of invested capital have today a greater security of\r\npresent and future earning power than before.  This is because of\r\nthe establishment of fair, competitive standards and because of\r\nrelief from unfair competition in wage cutting which depresses\r\nmarkets and destroys purchasing power.  But it is an undeniable fact\r\nthat the restoration of other billions of sound investments to a\r\nreasonable earning power could not be brought about in one year.\r\nThere is no magic formula, no economic panacea, which could simply\r\nrevive over-night the heavy industries and the trades dependent\r\nupon them.\r\n\r\nNevertheless the gains of trade and industry, as a whole, have been\r\nsubstantial.  In these gains and in the policies of the\r\nadministration there are assurances that hearten all forward-\r\nlooking men and women with the confidence that we are definitely\r\nrebuilding our political and economic system on the lines laid down\r\nby the New Deal--lines which as I have so often made clear, are in\r\ncomplete accord with the underlying principles of orderly popular\r\ngovernment which Americans have demanded since the white man first\r\ncame to these shores.  We count, in the future as in the past, on\r\nthe driving power of individual initiative and the incentive of\r\nfair private profit, strengthened with the acceptance of those\r\nobligations to the public interest which rest upon us all.  We have\r\nthe right to expect that this driving power will be given\r\npatriotically and whole-heartedly to our nation.\r\n\r\nWe have passed through the formative period of code making in the\r\nNational Recovery Administration and have effected a reorganization\r\nof the N.R.A. suited to the needs of the next phase, which is, in\r\nturn, a period of preparation for legislation which will determine\r\nits permanent form.\r\n\r\nIn this recent reorganization we have recognized three distinct\r\nfunctions:  first, the legislative or policy making function;\r\nsecond, the administrative function of code making and revision;\r\nand, third, the judicial function, which includes enforcement,\r\nconsumer complaints and the settlement of disputes between\r\nemployers and employees and between one employer and another.\r\n\r\nWe are now prepared to move into this second phase, on the basis of\r\nour experience in the first phase under the able and energetic\r\nleadership of General Johnson.\r\n\r\nWe shall watch carefully the working of this new machinery for the\r\nsecond phase of N.R.A., modifying it where it needs modification\r\nand finally making recommendations to the Congress, in order that\r\nthe functions of N.R.A. which have proved their worth may be made a\r\npart of the permanent machinery of government.\r\n\r\nLet me call your attention to the fact that the national Industrial\r\nRecovery Act gave businessmen the opportunity they had sought for\r\nyears to improve business conditions through what has been called\r\nself-government in industry.  If the codes which have been written\r\nhave been too complicated, if they have gone too far in such\r\nmatters as price fixing and limitation of production, let it be\r\nremembered that so far as possible, consistent with the immediate\r\npublic interest of this past year and the vital necessity of\r\nimproving labor conditions, the representatives of trade and\r\nindustry were permitted to write their ideas into the codes.  It is\r\nnow time to review these actions as a whole to determine through\r\ndeliberative means in the light of experience, from the standpoint\r\nof the good of the industries themselves, as well as the general\r\npublic interest, whether the methods and policies adopted in the\r\nemergency have been best calculated to promote industrial recovery\r\nand a permanent improvement of business and labor conditions.  There\r\nmay be a serious question as to the wisdom of many of those devices\r\nto control production, or to prevent destructive price cutting\r\nwhich many business organizations have insisted were necessary, or\r\nwhether their effect may have been to prevent that volume of\r\nproduction which would make possible lower prices and increased\r\nemployment.  Another question arises as to whether in fixing minimum\r\nwages on the basis of an hourly or weekly wage we have reached into\r\nthe heart of the problem which is to provide such annual earnings\r\nfor the lowest paid worker as will meet his minimum needs.  We also\r\nquestion the wisdom of extending code requirements suited to the\r\ngreat industrial centers and to large employers, to the great\r\nnumber of small employers in the smaller communities.\r\n\r\nDuring the last twelve months our industrial recovery has been to\r\nsome extent retarded by strikes, including a few of major\r\nimportance.  I would not minimize the inevitable losses to employers\r\nand employees and to the general public through such conflicts.  But\r\nI would point out that the extent and severity of labor disputes\r\nduring this period has been far less than in any previous,\r\ncomparable period.\r\n\r\nWhen the businessmen of the country were demanding the right to\r\norganize themselves adequately to promote their legitimate\r\ninterests; when the farmers were demanding legislation which would\r\ngive them opportunities and incentives to organize themselves for a\r\ncommon advance, it was natural that the workers should seek and\r\nobtain a statutory declaration of their constitutional right to\r\norganize themselves for collective bargaining as embodied in\r\nSection 7 (a) of the national Industrial Recovery Act.\r\n\r\nMachinery set up by the federal government has provided some new\r\nmethods of adjustment.  Both employers and employees must share the\r\nblame of not using them as fully as they should.  The employer who\r\nturns away from impartial agencies of peace, who denies freedom of\r\norganization to his employees, or fails to make every reasonable\r\neffort at a peaceful solution of their differences, is not fully\r\nsupporting the recovery effort of his government.  The workers who\r\nturn away from these same impartial agencies and decline to use\r\ntheir good offices to gain their ends are likewise not fully\r\ncooperating with their government.\r\n\r\nIt is time that we made a clean-cut effort to bring about that\r\nunited action of management and labor, which is one of the high\r\npurposes of the Recovery Act.  We have passed through more than a\r\nyear of education.  Step by step we have created all the government\r\nagencies necessary to insure, as a general rule, industrial peace,\r\nwith justice for all those willing to use these agencies whenever\r\ntheir voluntary bargaining fails to produce a necessary agreement.\r\n\r\nThere should be at least a full and fair trial given to these means\r\nof ending industrial warfare; and in such an effort we should be\r\nable to secure for employers and employees and consumers the\r\nbenefits that all derive from the continuous, peaceful operation of\r\nour essential enterprises.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, I propose to confer within the coming month with small\r\ngroups of those truly representative of large employers of labor\r\nand of large groups of organized labor, in order to seek their\r\ncooperation in establishing what I may describe as a specific trial\r\nperiod of industrial peace.\r\n\r\nFrom those willing to join in establishing this hoped-for period of\r\npeace, I shall seek assurances of the making and maintenance of\r\nagreements, which can be mutually relied upon, under which wages,\r\nhours and working conditions may be determined and any later\r\nadjustments shall be made either by agreement or, in case of\r\ndisagreement, through the mediation or arbitration of state or\r\nfederal agencies.  I shall not ask either employers or employees\r\npermanently to lay aside the weapons common to industrial war.  But\r\nI shall ask both groups to give a fair trial to peaceful methods of\r\nadjusting their conflicts of opinion and interest, and to\r\nexperiment for a reasonable time with measures suitable to civilize\r\nour industrial civilization.\r\n\r\nClosely allied to the N.R.A. is the program of Public Works\r\nprovided for in the same Act and designed to put more men back to\r\nwork, both directly on the public works themselves, and indirectly\r\nin the industries supplying the materials for these public works.\r\nTo those who say that our expenditures for public works and other\r\nmeans for recovery are a waste that we cannot afford, I answer that\r\nno country, however rich, can afford the waste of its human\r\nresources.  Demoralization caused by vast unemployment is our\r\ngreatest extravagance.  Morally, it is the greatest menace to our\r\nsocial order.  Some people try to tell me that we must make up our\r\nminds that for the future we shall permanently have millions of\r\nunemployed just as other countries have had them for over a decade.\r\nWhat may be necessary for those countries is not my responsibility\r\nto determine.  But as for this country, I stand or fall by my\r\nrefusal to accept as a necessary condition of our future a\r\npermanent army of unemployed.  On the contrary, we must make it a\r\nnational principle that we will not tolerate a large army of\r\nunemployed and that we will arrange our national economy to end our\r\npresent unemployment as soon as we can and then to take wise\r\nmeasures against its return.  I do not want to think that it is the\r\ndestiny of any American to remain permanently on relief rolls.\r\n\r\nThose, fortunately few in number, who are frightened by boldness\r\nand cowed by the necessity for making decisions, complain that all\r\nwe have done is unnecessary and subject to great risks.  Now that\r\nthese people are coming out of their storm cellars, they forget\r\nthat there ever was a storm.  They point to England.  They would have\r\nyou believe that England has made progress out of her depression by\r\na do-nothing policy, by letting nature take her course.  England has\r\nher peculiarities and we have ours but I do not believe any\r\nintelligent observer can accuse England of undue orthodoxy in the\r\npresent emergency.\r\n\r\nDid England let nature take her course?  No.  Did England hold to the\r\ngold standard when her reserves were threatened?  No.  Has England\r\ngone back to the gold standard today?  No.  Did England hesitate to\r\ncall in ten billion dollars of her war bonds bearing 5 percent\r\ninterest, to issue new bonds therefore bearing only 3-1/2 percent\r\ninterest, thereby saving the British treasury one hundred and fifty\r\nmillion dollars a year in interest alone?  No.  And let it be\r\nrecorded that the British bankers helped.  Is it not a fact that\r\never since the year 1909, Great Britain in many ways has advanced\r\nfurther along lines of social security than the United States?  Is\r\nit not a fact that relations between capital and labor on the basis\r\nof collective bargaining are much further advanced in Great Britain\r\nthan in the United States?  It is perhaps not strange that the\r\nconservative British press has told us with pardonable irony that\r\nmuch of our New Deal program is only an attempt to catch up with\r\nEnglish reforms that go back ten years or more.\r\n\r\nNearly all Americans are sensible and calm people.  We do not get\r\ngreatly excited nor is our peace of mind disturbed, whether we be\r\nbusinessmen or workers or farmers, by awesome pronouncements\r\nconcerning the unconstitutionality of some of our measures of\r\nrecovery and relief and reform.  We are not frightened by\r\nreactionary lawyers or political editors.  All of these cries have\r\nbeen heard before.  More than twenty years ago, when Theodore\r\nRoosevelt and Woodrow Wilson were attempting to correct abuses in\r\nour national life, the great Chief Justice White said:\r\n\r\n\"There is great danger it seems to me to arise from the constant\r\nhabit which prevails where anything is opposed or objected to, of\r\nreferring without rhyme or reason to the Constitution as a means of\r\npreventing its accomplishment, thus creating the general impression\r\nthat the Constitution is but a barrier to progress instead of being\r\nthe broad highway through which alone true progress may be\r\nenjoyed.\"\r\n\r\nIn our efforts for recovery we have avoided on the one hand the\r\ntheory that business should and must be taken over into an all-\r\nembracing government.  We have avoided on the other hand the equally\r\nuntenable theory that it is an interference with liberty to offer\r\nreasonable help when private enterprise is in need of help.  The\r\ncourse we have followed fits the American practice of government--a\r\npractice of taking action step by step, of regulating only to meet\r\nconcrete needs--a practice of courageous recognition of change.  I\r\nbelieve with Abraham Lincoln, that \"The legitimate object of\r\ngovernment is to do for a community of people whatever they need to\r\nhave done but cannot do at all or cannot do so well for themselves\r\nin their separate and individual capacities.\"\r\n\r\nI am not for a return to that definition of liberty under which for\r\nmany years a free people were being gradually regimented into the\r\nservice of the privileged few.  I prefer and I am sure you prefer\r\nthat broader definition of liberty under which we are moving\r\nforward to greater freedom, to greater security for the average man\r\nthan he has ever known before in the history of America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApril 28, 1935.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince my annual message to the Congress on January fourth, last, I\r\nhave not addressed the general public over the air.  In the many\r\nweeks since that time the Congress has devoted itself to the\r\narduous task of formulating legislation necessary to the country's\r\nwelfare.  It has made and is making distinct progress.\r\n\r\nBefore I come to any of the specific measures, however, I want to\r\nleave in your minds one clear fact.  The administration and the\r\nCongress are not proceeding in any haphazard fashion in this task\r\nof government.  Each of our steps has a definite relationship to\r\nevery other step.  The job of creating a program for the nation's\r\nwelfare is, in some respects, like the building of a ship.  At\r\ndifferent points on the coast where I often visit they build great\r\nseagoing ships.  When one of these ships is under construction and\r\nthe steel frames have been set in the keel, it is difficult for a\r\nperson who does not know ships to tell how it will finally look\r\nwhen it is sailing the high seas.\r\n\r\nIt may seem confused to some, but out of the multitude of detailed\r\nparts that go into the making of the structure the creation of a\r\nuseful instrument for man ultimately comes.  It is that way with the\r\nmaking of a national policy.  The objective of the nation has\r\ngreatly changed in three years.  Before that time individual self-\r\ninterest and group selfishness were paramount in public thinking.\r\nThe general good was at a discount.\r\n\r\nThree years of hard thinking have changed the picture.  More and\r\nmore people, because of clearer thinking and a better\r\nunderstanding, are considering the whole rather than a mere part\r\nrelating to one section or to one crop, or to one industry, or to\r\nan individual private occupation.  That is a tremendous gain for the\r\nprinciples of democracy.  The overwhelming majority of people in\r\nthis country know how to sift the wheat from the chaff in what they\r\nhear and what they read.  They know that the process of the\r\nconstructive rebuilding of America cannot be done in a day or a\r\nyear, but that it is being done in spite of the few who seek to\r\nconfuse them and to profit by their confusion.  Americans as a whole\r\nare feeling a lot better--a lot more cheerful than for many, many\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThe most difficult place in the world to get a clear open\r\nperspective of the country as a whole is Washington.  I am reminded\r\nsometimes of what President Wilson once said:  \"So many people come\r\nto Washington who know things that are not so, and so few people\r\nwho know anything about what the people of the United States are\r\nthinking about.\"  That is why I occasionally leave this scene of\r\naction for a few days to go fishing or back home to Hyde Park, so\r\nthat I can have a chance to think quietly about the country as a\r\nwhole.  \"To get away from the trees\", as they say, \"and to look at\r\nthe whole forest.\"  This duty of seeing the country in a long-range\r\nperspective is one which, in a very special manner, attaches to\r\nthis office to which you have chosen me.  Did you ever stop to think\r\nthat there are, after all, only two positions in the nation that\r\nare filled by the vote of all of the voters--the President and the\r\nVice-President?  That makes it particularly necessary for the Vice-\r\nPresident and for me to conceive of our duty toward the entire\r\ncountry.  I speak, therefore, tonight, to and of the American people\r\nas a whole.\r\n\r\nMy most immediate concern is in carrying out the purposes of the\r\ngreat work program just enacted by the Congress.  Its first\r\nobjective is to put men and women now on the relief rolls to work\r\nand, incidentally, to assist materially in our already unmistakable\r\nmarch toward recovery.  I shall not confuse my discussion by a\r\nmultitude of figures.  So many figures are quoted to prove so many\r\nthings.  Sometimes it depends upon what paper you read and what\r\nbroadcast you hear.  Therefore, let us keep our minds on two or\r\nthree simple, essential facts in connection with this problem of\r\nunemployment.  It is true that while business and industry are\r\ndefinitely better our relief rolls are still too large.  However,\r\nfor the first time in five years the relief rolls have declined\r\ninstead of increased during the winter months.  They are still\r\ndeclining.  The simple fact is that many million more people have\r\nprivate work today than two years ago today or one year ago today,\r\nand every day that passes offers more chances to work for those who\r\nwant to work.  In spite of the fact that unemployment remains a\r\nserious problem here as in every other nation, we have come to\r\nrecognize the possibility and the necessity of certain helpful\r\nremedial measures.  These measures are of two kinds.  The first is to\r\nmake provisions intended to relieve, to minimize, and to prevent\r\nfuture unemployment; the second is to establish the practical means\r\nto help those who are unemployed in this present emergency.  Our\r\nsocial security legislation is an attempt to answer the first of\r\nthese questions; our Works Relief program, the second.\r\n\r\nThe program for social security now pending before the Congress is\r\na necessary part of the future unemployment policy of the\r\ngovernment.  While our present and projected expenditures for work\r\nrelief are wholly within the reasonable limits of our national\r\ncredit resources, it is obvious that we cannot continue to create\r\ngovernmental deficits for that purpose year after year.  We must\r\nbegin now to make provision for the future.  That is why our social\r\nsecurity program is an important part of the complete picture.  It\r\nproposes, by means of old age pensions, to help those who have\r\nreached the age of retirement to give up their jobs and thus give\r\nto the younger generation greater opportunities for work and to\r\ngive to all a feeling of security as they look toward old age.\r\n\r\nThe unemployment insurance part of the legislation will not only\r\nhelp to guard the individual in future periods of lay-off against\r\ndependence upon relief, but it will, by sustaining purchasing\r\npower, cushion the shock of economic distress.  Another helpful\r\nfeature of unemployment insurance is the incentive it will give to\r\nemployers to plan more carefully in order that unemployment may be\r\nprevented by the stabilizing of employment itself.\r\n\r\nProvisions for social security, however, are protections for the\r\nfuture.  Our responsibility for the immediate necessities of the\r\nunemployed has been met by the Congress through the most\r\ncomprehensive work plan in the history of the nation.  Our problem\r\nis to put to work three and one-half million employable persons now\r\non the relief rolls.  It is a problem quite as much for private\r\nindustry as for the government.\r\n\r\nWe are losing no time getting the government's vast work relief\r\nprogram underway, and we have every reason to believe that it\r\nshould be in full swing by autumn.  In directing it, I shall\r\nrecognize six fundamental principles:\r\n\r\n(1) The projects should be useful.\r\n\r\n(2) Projects shall be of a nature that a considerable proportion of\r\nthe money spent will go into wages for labor.\r\n\r\n(3) Projects will be sought which promise ultimate return to the\r\nfederal treasury of a considerable proportion of the costs.\r\n\r\n(4) Funds allotted for each project should be actually and promptly\r\nspent and not held over until later years.\r\n\r\n(5) In all cases projects must be of a character to give employment\r\nto those on the relief rolls.\r\n\r\n(6) Projects will be allocated to localities or relief areas in\r\nrelation to the number of workers on relief rolls in those areas.\r\n\r\nI next want to make it clear exactly how we shall direct the work.\r\n\r\n(1) I have set up a Division of Applications and Information to\r\nwhich all proposals for the expenditure of money must go for\r\npreliminary study and consideration.\r\n\r\n(2) After the Division of Applications and Information has sifted\r\nthose projects, they will be sent to an Allotment Division composed\r\nof representatives of the more important governmental agencies\r\ncharged with carrying on work relief projects.  The group will also\r\ninclude representatives of cities, and of labor, farming, banking\r\nand industry.  This Allotment Division will consider all of the\r\nrecommendations submitted to it and such projects as they approve\r\nwill be next submitted to the President who under the Act is\r\nrequired to make final allocations.\r\n\r\n(3) The next step will be to notify the proper government agency in\r\nwhose field the project falls, and also to notify another agency\r\nwhich I am creating--a Progress Division.  This Division will have\r\nthe duty of coordinating the purchases of materials and supplies\r\nand of making certain that people who are employed will be taken\r\nfrom the relief rolls.  It will also have the responsibility of\r\ndetermining work payments in various localities, of making full use\r\nof existing employment services and to assist people engaged in\r\nrelief work to move as rapidly as possible back into private\r\nemployment when such employment is available.  Moreover, this\r\nDivision will be charged with keeping projects moving on schedule.\r\n\r\n(4) I have felt it to be essentially wise and prudent to avoid, so\r\nfar as possible, the creation of new governmental machinery for\r\nsupervising this work.  The national government now has at least\r\nsixty different agencies with the staff and the experience and the\r\ncompetence necessary to carry on the two hundred and fifty or three\r\nhundred kinds of work that will be undertaken.  These agencies,\r\ntherefore, will simply be doing on a somewhat enlarged scale the\r\nsame sort of things that they have been doing.  This will make\r\ncertain that the largest possible portion of the funds allotted\r\nwill be spent for actually creating new work and not for building\r\nup expensive overhead organizations here in Washington.\r\n\r\nFor many months preparations have been under way.  The allotment of\r\nfunds for desirable projects has already begun.  The key men for the\r\nmajor responsibilities of this great task already have been\r\nselected.  I well realize that the country is expecting before this\r\nyear is out to see the \"dirt fly\", as they say, in carrying on the\r\nwork, and I assure my fellow citizens that no energy will be spared\r\nin using these funds effectively to make a major attack upon the\r\nproblem of unemployment.\r\n\r\nOur responsibility is to all of the people in this country.  This is\r\na great national crusade to destroy enforced idleness which is an\r\nenemy of the human spirit generated by this depression.  Our attack\r\nupon these enemies must be without stint and without\r\ndiscrimination.  No sectional, no political distinctions can be\r\npermitted.\r\n\r\nIt must, however, be recognized that when an enterprise of this\r\ncharacter is extended over more than three thousand counties\r\nthroughout the nation, there may be occasional instances of\r\ninefficiency, bad management, or misuse of funds.  When cases of\r\nthis kind occur, there will be those, of course, who will try to\r\ntell you that the exceptional failure is characteristic of the\r\nentire endeavor.  It should be remembered that in every big job\r\nthere are some imperfections.  There are chiselers in every walk of\r\nlife; there are those in every industry who are guilty of unfair\r\npractices; every profession has its black sheep, but long\r\nexperience in government has taught me that the exceptional\r\ninstances of wrong-doing in government are probably less numerous\r\nthan in almost every other line of endeavor.  The most effective\r\nmeans of preventing such evils in this Works Relief program will be\r\nthe eternal vigilance of the American people themselves.  I call\r\nupon my fellow citizens everywhere to cooperate with me in making\r\nthis the most efficient and the cleanest example of public\r\nenterprise the world has ever seen.\r\n\r\nIt is time to provide a smashing answer for those cynical men who\r\nsay that a democracy cannot be honest and efficient.  If you will\r\nhelp, this can be done.  I, therefore, hope you will watch the work\r\nin every corner of this Nation.  Feel free to criticize.  Tell me of\r\ninstances where work can be done better, or where improper\r\npractices prevail.  Neither you nor I want criticism conceived in a\r\npurely fault-finding or partisan spirit, but I am jealous of the\r\nright of every citizen to call to the attention of his or her\r\ngovernment examples of how the public money can be more effectively\r\nspent for the benefit of the American people.\r\n\r\nI now come, my friends, to a part of the remaining business before\r\nthe Congress.  It has under consideration many measures which\r\nprovide for the rounding out of the program of economic and social\r\nreconstruction with which we have been concerned for two years.  I\r\ncan mention only a few of them tonight, but I do not want my\r\nmention of specific measures to be interpreted as lack of interest\r\nin or disapproval of many other important proposals that are\r\npending.\r\n\r\nThe National Industrial Recovery Act expires on the sixteenth of\r\nJune.  After careful consideration, I have asked the Congress to\r\nextend the life of this useful agency of government.  As we have\r\nproceeded with the administration of this Act, we have found from\r\ntime to time more and more useful ways of promoting its purposes.\r\nNo reasonable person wants to abandon our present gains--we must\r\ncontinue to protect children, to enforce minimum wages, to prevent\r\nexcessive hours, to safeguard, define and enforce collective\r\nbargaining, and, while retaining fair competition, to eliminate so\r\nfar as humanly possible, the kinds of unfair practices by selfish\r\nminorities which unfortunately did more than anything else to bring\r\nabout the recent collapse of industries.\r\n\r\nThere is likewise pending before the Congress legislation to\r\nprovide for the elimination of unnecessary holding companies in the\r\npublic utility field.\r\n\r\nI consider this legislation a positive recovery measure.  Power\r\nproduction in this country is virtually back to the 1929 peak.  The\r\noperating companies in the gas and electric utility field are by\r\nand large in good condition.  But under holding company domination\r\nthe utility industry has long been hopelessly at war within itself\r\nand with public sentiment.  By far the greater part of the general\r\ndecline in utility securities had occurred before I was\r\ninaugurated.  The absentee management of unnecessary holding company\r\ncontrol has lost touch with, and has lost the sympathy of, the\r\ncommunities it pretends to serve.  Even more significantly it has\r\ngiven the country as a whole an uneasy apprehension of\r\noverconcentrated economic power.\r\n\r\nA business that loses the confidence of its customers and the good-\r\nwill of the public cannot long continue to be a good risk for the\r\ninvestor.  This legislation will serve the investor by ending the\r\nconditions which have caused that lack of confidence and good-will.\r\nIt will put the public utility operating industry on a sound basis\r\nfor the future, both in its public relations and in its internal\r\nrelations.\r\n\r\nThis legislation will not only in the long run result in providing\r\nlower electric and gas rates to the consumer, but it will protect\r\nthe actual value and earning power of properties now owned by\r\nthousands of investors who have little protection under the old\r\nlaws against what used to be called frenzied finance.  It will not\r\ndestroy values.\r\n\r\nNot only business recovery, but the general economic recovery of\r\nthe nation will be greatly stimulated by the enactment of\r\nlegislation designed to improve the status of our transportation\r\nagencies.  There is need for legislation providing for the\r\nregulation of interstate transportation by buses and trucks, for\r\nthe regulation of transportation by water, for the strengthening of\r\nour Merchant Marine and Air Transport, for the strengthening of the\r\nInterstate Commerce Commission to enable it to carry out a rounded\r\nconception of the national transportation system in which the\r\nbenefits of private ownership are retained while the public stake\r\nin these important services is protected by the public's\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nFinally, the reestablishment of public confidence in the banks of\r\nthe nation is one of the most hopeful results of our efforts as a\r\nNation to reestablish public confidence in private banking.  We all\r\nknow that private banking actually exists by virtue of the\r\npermission of and regulation by the people as a whole, speaking\r\nthrough their government.  Wise public policy, however, requires not\r\nonly that banking be safe but that its resources be most fully\r\nutilized in the economic life of the country.  To this end it was\r\ndecided more than twenty years ago that the government should\r\nassume the responsibility of providing a means by which the credit\r\nof the nation might be controlled, not by a few private banking\r\ninstitutions, but by a body with public prestige and authority.  The\r\nanswer to this demand was the Federal Reserve System.  Twenty years\r\nof experience with this system have justified the efforts made to\r\ncreate it, but these twenty years have shown by experience definite\r\npossibilities for improvement.  Certain proposals made to amend the\r\nFederal Reserve Act deserve prompt and favorable action by the\r\nCongress.  They are a minimum of wise readjustments of our Federal\r\nReserve System in the light of past experience and present needs.\r\n\r\nThese measures I have mentioned are, in large part, the program\r\nwhich under my constitutional duty I have recommended to the\r\nCongress.  They are essential factors in a rounded program for\r\nnational recovery.  They contemplate the enrichment of our national\r\nlife by a sound and rational ordering of its various elements and\r\nwise provisions for the protection of the weak against the strong.\r\n\r\nNever since my inauguration in March, 1933, have I felt so\r\nunmistakably the atmosphere of recovery.  But it is more than the\r\nrecovery of the material basis of our individual lives.  It is the\r\nrecovery of confidence in our democratic processes and\r\ninstitutions.  We have survived all of the arduous burdens and the\r\nthreatening dangers of a great economic calamity.  We have in the\r\ndarkest moments of our national trials retained our faith in our\r\nown ability to master our destiny.  Fear is vanishing and confidence\r\nis growing on every side, renewed faith in the vast possibilities\r\nof human beings to improve their material and spiritual status\r\nthrough the instrumentality of the democratic form of government.\r\nThat faith is receiving its just reward.  For that we can be\r\nthankful to the God who watches over America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSeptember 6, 1936.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have been on a journey of husbandry.  I went primarily to see at\r\nfirst hand conditions in the drought states; to see how effectively\r\nfederal and local authorities are taking care of pressing problems\r\nof relief and also how they are to work together to defend the\r\npeople of this country against the effects of future droughts.\r\n\r\nI saw drought devastation in nine states.\r\n\r\nI talked with families who had lost their wheat crop, lost their\r\ncorn crop, lost their livestock, lost the water in their well, lost\r\ntheir garden and come through to the end of the summer without one\r\ndollar of cash resources, facing a winter without feed or food--\r\nfacing a planting season without seed to put in the ground.\r\n\r\nThat was the extreme case, but there are thousands and thousands of\r\nfamilies on Western farms who share the same difficulties.\r\n\r\nI saw cattlemen who because of lack of grass or lack of winter feed\r\nhave been completely compelled to sell all but their breeding stock\r\nand will need help to carry even these through the coming winter.  I\r\nsaw livestock kept alive only because water had been brought to\r\nthem long distances in tank cars.  I saw other farm families who\r\nhave not lost everything but who, because they have made only\r\npartial crops, must have some form of help if they are to continue\r\nfarming next spring.\r\n\r\nI shall never forget the fields of wheat so blasted by heat that\r\nthey cannot be harvested.  I shall never forget field after field of\r\ncorn stunted, earless and stripped of leaves, for what the sun left\r\nthe grasshoppers took.  I saw brown pastures which would not keep a\r\ncow on fifty acres.\r\n\r\nYet I would not have you think for a single minute that there is\r\npermanent disaster in these drought regions, or that the picture I\r\nsaw meant depopulating these areas.  No cracked earth, no blistering\r\nsun, no burning wind, no grasshoppers, are a permanent match for\r\nthe indomitable American farmers and stockmen and their wives and\r\nchildren who have carried on through desperate days, and inspire us\r\nwith their self-reliance, their tenacity and their courage.  It was\r\ntheir fathers' task to make homes; it is their task to keep those\r\nhomes; it is our task to help them win their fight.\r\n\r\nFirst let me talk for a minute about this autumn and the coming\r\nwinter.  We have the option, in the case of families who need actual\r\nsubsistence, of putting them on the dole or putting them to work.\r\nThey do not want to go on the dole and they are one thousand\r\npercent right.  We agree, therefore, that we must put them to work\r\nfor a decent wage; and when we reach that decision we kill two\r\nbirds with one stone, because these families will earn enough by\r\nworking, not only to subsist themselves, but to buy food for their\r\nstock, and seed for next year's planting.  Into this scheme of\r\nthings there fit of course the government lending agencies which\r\nnext year, as in the past, will help with production loans.\r\n\r\nEvery governor with whom I have talked is in full accord with this\r\nprogram of doing work for these farm families, just as every\r\ngovernor agrees that the individual states will take care of their\r\nunemployables but that the cost of employing those who are entirely\r\nable and willing to work must be borne by the federal government.\r\n\r\nIf then we know, as we do today, the approximate number of farm\r\nfamilies who will require some form of work relief from now on\r\nthrough the winter, we face the question of what kind of work they\r\nshould do.  Let me make it clear that this is not a new question\r\nbecause it has already been answered to a greater or less extent in\r\nevery one of the drought communities.  Beginning in 1934, when we\r\nalso had serious drought conditions, the state and federal\r\ngovernments cooperated in planning a large number of projects--many\r\nof them directly aimed at the alleviation of future drought\r\nconditions.  In accordance with that program literally thousands of\r\nponds or small reservoirs have been built in order to supply water\r\nfor stock and to lift the level of the underground water to protect\r\nwells from going dry.  Thousands of wells have been drilled or\r\ndeepened; community lakes have been created and irrigation projects\r\nare being pushed.\r\n\r\nWater conservation by means such as these is being expanded as a\r\nresult of this new drought all through the Great Plains area, the\r\nWestern corn belt and in the states that lie further south.  In the\r\nMiddle West water conservation is not so pressing a problem.  Here\r\nthe work projects run more to soil erosion control and the building\r\nof farm-to-market roads.\r\n\r\nSpending like this is not waste.  It would spell future waste if we\r\ndid not spend for such things now.  These emergency work projects\r\nprovide money to buy food and clothing for the winter; they keep\r\nthe livestock on the farm; they provide seed for a new crop, and,\r\nbest of all, they will conserve soil and water in the future in\r\nthose areas most frequently hit by drought.\r\n\r\nIf, for example, in some local area the water table continues to\r\ndrop and the topsoil to blow away, the land values will disappear\r\nwith the water and the soil.  People on the farms will drift into\r\nthe nearby cities; the cities will have no farm trade and the\r\nworkers in the city factories and stores will have no jobs.\r\nProperty values in the cities will decline.  If, on the other hand,\r\nthe farms within that area remain as farms with better water supply\r\nand no erosion, the farm population will stay on the land and\r\nprosper and the nearby cities will prosper too.  Property values\r\nwill increase instead of disappearing.  That is why it is worth our\r\nwhile as a nation to spend money in order to save money.\r\n\r\nI have used the argument in relation only to a small area.  It holds\r\ngood in its effect on the nation as a whole.  Every state in the\r\ndrought area is now doing and always will do business with every\r\nstate outside it.  The very existence of the men and women working\r\nin the clothing factories of New York, making clothes worn by\r\nfarmers and their families; of the workers in the steel mills in\r\nPittsburgh, in the automobile factories of Detroit, and in the\r\nharvester factories of Illinois, depend upon the farmers' ability\r\nto purchase the commodities they produce.  In the same way it is the\r\npurchasing power of the workers in these factories in the cities\r\nthat enables them and their wives and children to eat more beef,\r\nmore pork, more wheat, more corn, more fruit and more dairy\r\nproducts, and to buy more clothing made from cotton, wool and\r\nleather.  In a physical and a property sense, as well as in a\r\nspiritual sense, we are members one of another.\r\n\r\nI want to make it clear that no simple panacea can be applied to\r\nthe drought problem in the whole of the drought area.  Plans must\r\ndepend on local conditions, for these vary with annual rainfall,\r\nsoil characteristics, altitude and topography.  Water and soil\r\nconservation methods may differ in one county from those in an\r\nadjoining county.  Work to be done in the cattle and sheep country\r\ndiffers in type from work in the wheat country or work in the corn\r\nbelt.\r\n\r\nThe Great Plains Drought Area Committee has given me its\r\npreliminary recommendations for a long-time program for that\r\nregion.  Using that report as a basis we are cooperating\r\nsuccessfully and in entire accord with the governors and state\r\nplanning boards.  As we get this program into operation the people\r\nmore and more will be able to maintain themselves securely on the\r\nland.  That will mean a steady decline in the relief burdens which\r\nthe federal government and states have had to assume in time of\r\ndrought; but, more important, it will mean a greater contribution\r\nto general national prosperity by these regions which have been hit\r\nby drought.  It will conserve and improve not only property values,\r\nbut human values.  The people in the drought area do not want to be\r\ndependent on federal, state or any other kind of charity.  They want\r\nfor themselves and their families an opportunity to share fairly by\r\ntheir own efforts in the progress of America.\r\n\r\nThe farmers of America want a sound national agricultural policy in\r\nwhich a permanent land-use program will have an important place.\r\nThey want assurance against another year like 1932 when they made\r\ngood crops but had to sell them for prices that meant ruin just as\r\nsurely as did the drought.  Sound policy must maintain farm prices\r\nin good crop years as well as in bad crop years.  It must function\r\nwhen we have drought; it must also function when we have bumper\r\ncrops.\r\n\r\nThe maintenance of a fair equilibrium between farm prices and the\r\nprices of industrial products is an aim which we must keep ever\r\nbefore us, just as we must give constant thought to the sufficiency\r\nof the food supply of the nation even in bad years.  Our modern\r\ncivilization can and should devise a more successful means by which\r\nthe excess supplies of bumper years can be conserved for use in\r\nlean years.\r\n\r\nOn my trip I have been deeply impressed with the general efficiency\r\nof those agencies of the federal, state and local governments which\r\nhave moved in on the immediate task created by the drought.  In 1934\r\nnone of us had preparation; we worked without blueprints and made\r\nthe mistakes of inexperience.  Hindsight shows us this.  But as time\r\nhas gone on we have been making fewer and fewer mistakes.  Remember\r\nthat the federal and state governments have done only broad\r\nplanning.  Actual work on a given project originates in the local\r\ncommunity.  Local needs are listed from local information.  Local\r\nprojects are decided on only after obtaining the recommendations\r\nand help of those in the local community who are best able to give\r\nit.  And it is worthy of note that on my entire trip, though I asked\r\nthe question dozens of times, I heard no complaint against the\r\ncharacter of a single work relief project.\r\n\r\nThe elected heads of the states concerned, together with their\r\nstate officials and their experts from agricultural colleges and\r\nstate planning boards, have shown cooperation with and approval of\r\nthe work which the federal government has headed.  I am grateful\r\nalso to the men and women in all these states who have accepted\r\nleadership in the work in their locality.\r\n\r\nIn the drought area people are not afraid to use new methods to\r\nmeet changes in Nature, and to correct mistakes of the past.  If\r\novergrazing has injured range lands, they are willing to reduce the\r\ngrazing.  If certain wheat lands should be returned to pasture they\r\nare willing to cooperate.  If trees should be planted as windbreaks\r\nor to stop erosion they will work with us.  If terracing or summer\r\nfallowing or crop rotation is called for, they will carry them out.\r\nThey stand ready to fit, and not to fight, the ways of Nature.\r\n\r\nWe are helping, and shall continue to help the farmer to do those\r\nthings, through local soil conservation committees and other\r\ncooperative local, state and federal agencies of government.\r\n\r\nI have not the time tonight to deal with other and more\r\ncomprehensive agricultural policies.\r\n\r\nWith this fine help we are tiding over the present emergency.  We\r\nare going to conserve soil, conserve water and conserve life.  We\r\nare going to have long-time defenses against both low prices and\r\ndrought.  We are going to have a farm policy that will serve the\r\nnational welfare.  That is our hope for the future.\r\n\r\nThere are two reasons why I want to end by talking about\r\nreemployment.  Tomorrow is Labor Day.  The brave spirit with which so\r\nmany millions of working people are winning their way out of\r\ndepression deserves respect and admiration.  It is like the courage\r\nof the farmers in the drought areas.\r\n\r\nThat is my first reason.  The second is that healthy employment\r\nconditions stand equally with healthy agricultural conditions as a\r\nbuttress of national prosperity.  Dependable employment at fair\r\nwages is just as important to the people in the towns and cities as\r\ngood farm income is to agriculture.  Our people must have the\r\nability to buy the goods they manufacture and the crops they\r\nproduce.  Thus city wages and farm buying power are the two strong\r\nlegs that carry the nation forward.\r\n\r\nReemployment in industry is proceeding rapidly.  Government spending\r\nwas in large part responsible for keeping industry going and\r\nputting it in a position to make this reemployment possible.\r\nGovernment orders were the backlog of heavy industry; government\r\nwages turned over and over again to make consumer purchasing power\r\nand to sustain every merchant in the community.  Businessmen with\r\ntheir businesses, small and large, had to be saved.  Private\r\nenterprise is necessary to any nation which seeks to maintain the\r\ndemocratic form of government.  In their case, just as certainly as\r\nin the case of drought-stricken farmers, government spending has\r\nsaved.\r\n\r\nGovernment having spent wisely to save it, private industry begins\r\nto take workers off the rolls of the government relief program.\r\nUntil this administration we had no free employment service, except\r\nin a few states and cities.  Because there was no unified employment\r\nservice, the worker, forced to move as industry moved, often\r\ntravelled over the country, wandering after jobs which seemed\r\nalways to travel just a little faster than he did.  He was often\r\nvictimized by fraudulent practices of employment clearing houses,\r\nand the facts of employment opportunities were at the disposal\r\nneither of himself nor of the employer.\r\n\r\nIn 1933 the United States Employment Service was created--a\r\ncooperative state and federal enterprise, through which the federal\r\ngovernment matches dollar for dollar the funds provided by the\r\nstates for registering the occupations and skills of workers and\r\nfor actually finding jobs for these registered workers in private\r\nindustry.  The federal-state cooperation has been splendid.  Already\r\nemployment services are operating in thirty-two states, and the\r\nareas not covered by them are served by the federal government.\r\n\r\nWe have developed a nationwide service with seven hundred district\r\noffices and one thousand branch offices, thus providing facilities\r\nthrough which labor can learn of jobs available and employers can\r\nfind workers.\r\n\r\nLast spring I expressed the hope that employers would realize their\r\ndeep responsibility to take men off the relief rolls and give them\r\njobs in private enterprise.  Subsequently I was told by many\r\nemployers that they were not satisfied with the information\r\navailable concerning the skill and experience of the workers on the\r\nrelief rolls.  On August 25th I allocated a relatively small sum to\r\nthe employment service for the purpose of getting better and more\r\nrecent information in regard to those now actively at work on\r\nW.P.A.  Projects--information as to their skills and previous\r\noccupations--and to keep the records of such men and women up-to-\r\ndate for maximum service in making them available to industry.\r\nTonight I am announcing the allocation of two and a half million\r\ndollars more to enable the Employment Service to make an even more\r\nintensive search then it has yet been equipped to make, to find\r\nopportunities in private employment for workers registered with it.\r\n\r\nTonight I urge the workers to cooperate with and take full\r\nadvantage of this intensification of the work of the Employment\r\nService.  This does not mean that there will be any lessening of our\r\nefforts under our W.P.A. and P.W.A. and other work relief programs\r\nuntil all workers have decent jobs in private employment at decent\r\nwages.  We do not surrender our responsibility to the unemployed.  We\r\nhave had ample proof that it is the will of the American people\r\nthat those who represent them in national, state and local\r\ngovernment should continue as long as necessary to discharge that\r\nresponsibility.  But it does mean that the government wants to use\r\nresource to get private work for those now employed on government\r\nwork, and thus to curtail to a minimum the government expenditures\r\nfor direct employment.\r\n\r\nTonight I ask employers, large and small, throughout the nation, to\r\nuse the help of the state and Federal Employment Service whenever\r\nin the general pick-up of business they require more workers.\r\n\r\nTomorrow is Labor Day.  Labor Day in this country has never been a\r\nclass holiday.  It has always been a national holiday.  It has never\r\nhad more significance as a national holiday than it has now.  In\r\nother countries the relationship of employer and employee has been\r\nmore or less been accepted as a class relationship not readily to\r\nbe broken through.  In this country we insist, as an essential of\r\nthe American way of life, that the employer-employee relationship\r\nshould be one between free men and equals.  We refuse to regard\r\nthose who work with hand or brain as different from or inferior to\r\nthose who live from their property.  We insist that labor is\r\nentitled to as much respect as property.  But our workers with hand\r\nand brain deserve more than respect for their labor.  They deserve\r\npractical protection in the opportunity to use their labor at a\r\nreturn adequate to support them at a decent and constantly rising\r\nstandard of living, and to accumulate a margin of security against\r\nthe inevitable vicissitudes of life.\r\n\r\nThe average man must have that twofold opportunity if we are to\r\navoid the growth of a class-conscious society in this country.\r\n\r\nThere are those who fail to read both the signs of the times and\r\nAmerican history.  They would try to refuse the worker any effective\r\npower to bargain collectively, to earn a decent livelihood and to\r\nacquire security.  It is those short-sighted ones, not labor, who\r\nthreaten this country with that class dissension which in other\r\ncountries has led to dictatorship and the establishment of fear and\r\nhatred as the dominant emotions in human life.\r\n\r\nAll American workers, brain workers and manual workers alike, and\r\nall the rest of us whose well-being depends on theirs, know that\r\nour needs are one in building an orderly economic democracy in\r\nwhich all can profit and in which all can be secure from the kind\r\nof faulty economic direction which brought us to the brink of\r\ncommon ruin seven years ago.\r\n\r\nThere is no cleavage between white collar workers and manual\r\nworkers, between artists and artisans, musicians and mechanics,\r\nlawyers and accountants and architects and miners.\r\n\r\nTomorrow, Labor Day, belongs to all of us.  Tomorrow, Labor Day,\r\nsymbolizes the hope of all Americans.  Anyone who calls it a class\r\nholiday challenges the whole concept of American democracy.\r\n\r\nThe Fourth of July commemorates our political freedom--a freedom\r\nwhich without economic freedom is meaningless indeed.  Labor Day\r\nsymbolizes our determination to achieve an economic freedom for the\r\naverage man which will give his political freedom reality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMarch 9, 1937.\r\n\r\n\r\nLast Thursday I described in detail certain economic problems which\r\neveryone admits now face the nation.  For the many messages which\r\nhave come to me after that speech, and which it is physically\r\nimpossible to answer individually, I take this means of saying\r\n\"thank you.\"\r\n\r\nTonight, sitting at my desk in the White House, I make my first\r\nradio report to the people in my second term of office.\r\n\r\nI am reminded of that evening in March, four years ago, when I made\r\nmy first radio report to you.  We were then in the midst of the\r\ngreat banking crisis.\r\n\r\nSoon after, with the authority of the Congress, we asked the nation\r\nto turn over all of its privately held gold, dollar for dollar, to\r\nthe government of the United States.\r\n\r\nToday's recovery proves how right that policy was.\r\n\r\nBut when, almost two years later, it came before the Supreme Court\r\nits constitutionality was upheld only by a five-to-four vote.  The\r\nchange of one vote would have thrown all the affairs of this great\r\nNation back into hopeless chaos.  In effect, four Justices ruled\r\nthat the right under a private contract to exact a pound of flesh\r\nwas more sacred than the main objectives of the Constitution to\r\nestablish an enduring Nation.\r\n\r\nIn 1933 you and I knew that we must never let our economic system\r\nget completely out of joint again--that we could not afford to take\r\nthe risk of another great depression.\r\n\r\nWe also became convinced that the only way to avoid a repetition of\r\nthose dark days was to have a government with power to prevent and\r\nto cure the abuses and the inequalities which had thrown that\r\nsystem out of joint.\r\n\r\nWe then began a program of remedying those abuses and\r\ninequalities--to give balance and stability to our economic\r\nsystem--to make it bomb-proof against the causes of 1929.\r\n\r\nToday we are only part-way through that program--and recovery is\r\nspeeding up to a point where the dangers of 1929 are again becoming\r\npossible, not this week or month perhaps, but within a year or two.\r\n\r\nNational laws are needed to complete that program.  Individual or\r\nlocal or state effort alone cannot protect us in 1937 any better\r\nthan ten years ago.\r\n\r\nIt will take time--and plenty of time--to work out our remedies\r\nadministratively even after legislation is passed.  To complete our\r\nprogram of protection in time, therefore, we cannot delay one\r\nmoment in making certain that our national government has power to\r\ncarry through.\r\n\r\nFour years ago action did not come until the eleventh hour.  It was\r\nalmost too late.\r\n\r\nIf we learned anything from the depression we will not allow\r\nourselves to run around in new circles of futile discussion and\r\ndebate, always postponing the day of decision.\r\n\r\nThe American people have learned from the depression.  For in the\r\nlast three national elections an overwhelming majority of them\r\nvoted a mandate that the Congress and the President begin the task\r\nof providing that protection--not after long years of debate, but\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nThe courts, however, have cast doubts on the ability of the elected\r\nCongress to protect us against catastrophe by meeting squarely our\r\nmodern social and economic conditions.\r\n\r\nWe are at a crisis in our ability to proceed with that protection.\r\nIt is a quiet crisis.  There are no lines of depositors outside\r\nclosed banks.  But to the far-sighted it is far-reaching in its\r\npossibilities of injury to America.\r\n\r\nI want to talk with you very simply about the need for present\r\naction in this crisis--the need to meet the unanswered challenge of\r\none-third of a Nation ill-nourished, ill-clad, ill-housed.\r\n\r\nLast Thursday I described the American form of government as a\r\nthree horse team provided by the Constitution to the American\r\npeople so that their field might be plowed.  The three horses are,\r\nof course, the three branches of government--the Congress, the\r\nExecutive and the courts.  Two of the horses are pulling in unison\r\ntoday; the third is not.  Those who have intimated that the\r\nPresident of the United States is trying to drive that team,\r\noverlook the simple fact that the President, as Chief Executive, is\r\nhimself one of the three horses.\r\n\r\nIt is the American people themselves who are in the driver's seat.\r\n\r\nIt is the American people themselves who want the furrow plowed.\r\n\r\nIt is the American people themselves who expect the third horse to\r\npull in unison with the other two.\r\n\r\nI hope that you have re-read the Constitution of the United States\r\nin these past few weeks.  Like the Bible, it ought to be read again\r\nand again.\r\n\r\nIt is an easy document to understand when you remember that it was\r\ncalled into being because the Articles of Confederation under which\r\nthe original thirteen States tried to operate after the Revolution\r\nshowed the need of a national government with power enough to\r\nhandle national problems.  In its Preamble, the Constitution states\r\nthat it was intended to form a more perfect Union and promote the\r\ngeneral welfare; and the powers given to the Congress to carry out\r\nthose purposes can be best described by saying that they were all\r\nthe powers needed to meet each and every problem which then had a\r\nnational character and which could not be met by merely local\r\naction.\r\n\r\nBut the framers went further.  Having in mind that in succeeding\r\ngenerations many other problems then undreamed of would become\r\nnational problems, they gave to the Congress the ample broad powers\r\n\"to levy taxes. . . and provide for the common defense and general\r\nwelfare of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nThat, my friends, is what I honestly believe to have been the clear\r\nand underlying purpose of the patriots who wrote a federal\r\nconstitution to create a national government with national power,\r\nintended as they said, \"to form a more perfect union. . . for\r\nourselves and our posterity.\"\r\n\r\nFor nearly twenty years there was no conflict between the Congress\r\nand the Court.  Then Congress passed a statute which, in 1803, the\r\nCourt said violated an express provision of the Constitution.  The\r\nCourt claimed the power to declare it unconstitutional and did so\r\ndeclare it.  But a little later the Court itself admitted that it\r\nwas an extraordinary power to exercise and through Mr. Justice\r\nWashington laid down this limitation upon it:  \"It is but a decent\r\nrespect due to the wisdom, the integrity and the patriotism of the\r\nlegislative body, by which any law is passed, to presume in favor\r\nof its validity until its violation of the Constitution is proved\r\nbeyond all reasonable doubt.\"\r\n\r\nBut since the rise of the modern movement for social and economic\r\nprogress through legislation, the Court has more and more often and\r\nmore and more boldly asserted a power to veto laws passed by the\r\nCongress and state legislatures in complete disregard of this\r\noriginal limitation.\r\n\r\nIn the last four years the sound rule of giving statutes the\r\nbenefit of all reasonable doubt has been cast aside.  The Court has\r\nbeen acting not as a judicial body, but as a policy-making body.\r\n\r\nWhen the Congress has sought to stabilize national agriculture, to\r\nimprove the conditions of labor, to safeguard business against\r\nunfair competition, to protect our national resources, and in many\r\nother ways, to serve our clearly national needs, the majority of\r\nthe Court has been assuming the power to pass on the wisdom of\r\nthese acts of the Congress--and to approve or disapprove the public\r\npolicy written into these laws.\r\n\r\nThat is not only my accusation.  It is the accusation of most\r\ndistinguished justices of the present Supreme Court.  I have not the\r\ntime to quote to you all the language used by dissenting justices\r\nin many of these cases.  But in the case holding the Railroad\r\nRetirement Act unconstitutional, for instance, Chief Justice Hughes\r\nsaid in a dissenting opinion that the majority opinion was \"a\r\ndeparture from sound principles,\" and placed \"an unwarranted\r\nlimitation upon the commerce clause.\"  And three other justices\r\nagreed with him.\r\n\r\nIn the case of holding the A.A.A. unconstitutional, Justice Stone\r\nsaid of the majority opinion that it was a \"tortured construction\r\nof the Constitution.\"  And two other justices agreed with him.\r\n\r\nIn the case holding the New York Minimum Wage Law unconstitutional,\r\nJustice Stone said that the majority were actually reading into the\r\nConstitution their own \"personal economic predilections,\" and that\r\nif the legislative power is not left free to choose the methods of\r\nsolving the problems of poverty, subsistence, and health of large\r\nnumbers in the community, then \"government is to be rendered\r\nimpotent.\"  And two other justices agreed with him.\r\n\r\nIn the face of these dissenting opinions, there is no basis for the\r\nclaim made by some members of the Court that something in the\r\nConstitution has compelled them regretfully to thwart the will of\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\nIn the face of such dissenting opinions, it is perfectly clear\r\nthat, as Chief Justice Hughes has said, \"We are under a\r\nConstitution, but the Constitution is what the judges say it is.\"\r\n\r\nThe Court in addition to the proper use of its judicial functions\r\nhas improperly set itself up as a third house of the Congress--a\r\nsuper-legislature, as one of the justices has called it--reading\r\ninto the Constitution words and implications which are not there,\r\nand which were never intended to be there.\r\n\r\nWe have, therefore, reached the point as a nation where we must\r\ntake action to save the Constitution from the Court and the Court\r\nfrom itself.  We must find a way to take an appeal from the Supreme\r\nCourt to the Constitution itself.  We want a Supreme Court which\r\nwill do justice under the Constitution--not over it.  In our courts\r\nwe want a government of laws and not of men.\r\n\r\nI want--as all Americans want--an independent judiciary as proposed\r\nby the framers of the Constitution.  That means a Supreme Court that\r\nwill enforce the Constitution as written--that will refuse to amend\r\nthe Constitution by the arbitrary exercise of judicial power--\r\namended by judicial say-so.  It does not mean a judiciary so\r\nindependent that it can deny the existence of facts which are\r\nuniversally recognized.\r\n\r\nHow then could we proceed to perform the mandate given us?  It was\r\nsaid in last year's Democratic platform, \"If these problems cannot\r\nbe effectively solved within the Constitution, we shall seek such\r\nclarifying amendment as will assure the power to enact those laws,\r\nadequately to regulate commerce, protect public health and safety,\r\nand safeguard economic security.\"  In other words, we said we would\r\nseek an amendment only if every other possible means by legislation\r\nwere to fail.\r\n\r\nWhen I commenced to review the situation with the problem squarely\r\nbefore me, I came by a process of elimination to the conclusion\r\nthat, short of amendments, the only method which was clearly\r\nconstitutional, and would at the same time carry out other much\r\nneeded reforms, was to infuse new blood into all our courts.  We\r\nmust have men worthy and equipped to carry out impartial justice.\r\nBut, at the same time, we must have judges who will bring to the\r\ncourts a present-day sense of the Constitution--judges who will\r\nretain in the courts the judicial functions of a court, and reject\r\nthe legislative powers which the courts have today assumed.\r\n\r\nIn forty-five out of the forty-eight states of the Union, judges\r\nare chosen not for life but for a period of years.  In many states\r\njudges must retire at the age of seventy.  Congress has provided\r\nfinancial security by offering life pensions at full pay for\r\nfederal judges on all courts who are willing to retire at seventy.\r\nIn the case of Supreme Court justices, that pension is $20,000 a\r\nyear.  But all federal judges, once appointed, can, if they choose,\r\nhold office for life, no matter how old they may get to be.\r\n\r\nWhat is my proposal?  It is simply this:  whenever a judge or justice\r\nof any federal court has reached the age of seventy and does not\r\navail himself of the opportunity to retire on a pension, a new\r\nmember shall be appointed by the President then in office, with the\r\napproval, as required by the Constitution, of the Senate of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nThat plan has two chief purposes.  By bringing into the judicial\r\nsystem a steady and continuing stream of new and younger blood, I\r\nhope, first, to make the administration of all federal justice\r\nspeedier and, therefore, less costly; secondly, to bring to the\r\ndecision of social and economic problems younger men who have had\r\npersonal experience and contact with modern facts and circumstances\r\nunder which average men have to live and work.  This plan will save\r\nour national Constitution from hardening of the judicial arteries.\r\n\r\nThe number of judges to be appointed would depend wholly on the\r\ndecision of present judges now over seventy, or those who would\r\nsubsequently reach the age of seventy.\r\n\r\nIf, for instance, any one of the six justices of the Supreme Court\r\nnow over the age of seventy should retire as provided under the\r\nplan, no additional place would be created.  Consequently, although\r\nthere never can be more than fifteen, there may be only fourteen,\r\nor thirteen, or twelve.  And there may be only nine.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing novel or radical about this idea.  It seeks to\r\nmaintain the federal bench in full vigor.  It has been discussed and\r\napproved by many persons of high authority ever since a similar\r\nproposal passed the House of Representatives in 1869.\r\n\r\nWhy was the age fixed at seventy?  Because the laws of many states,\r\nthe practice of the Civil Service, the regulations of the Army and\r\nNavy, and the rules of many of our universities and of almost every\r\ngreat private business enterprise, commonly fix the retirement age\r\nat seventy years or less.\r\n\r\nThe statute would apply to all the courts in the federal system.\r\nThere is general approval so far as the lower federal courts are\r\nconcerned.  The plan has met opposition only so far as the Supreme\r\nCourt of the United States itself is concerned.  If such a plan is\r\ngood for the lower courts it certainly ought to be equally good for\r\nthe highest court from which there is no appeal.\r\n\r\nThose opposing this plan have sought to arouse prejudice and fear\r\nby crying that I am seeking to \"pack\" the Supreme Court and that a\r\nbaneful precedent will be established.\r\n\r\nWhat do they mean by the words \"packing the Court\"?\r\n\r\nLet me answer this question with a bluntness that will end all\r\n_honest_ misunderstanding of my purposes.\r\n\r\nIf by that phrase \"packing the Court\" it is charged that I wish to\r\nplace on the bench spineless puppets who would disregard the law\r\nand would decide specific cases as I wished them to be decided, I\r\nmake this answer:  that no President fit for his office would\r\nappoint, and no Senate of honorable men fit for their office would\r\nconfirm, that kind of appointees to the Supreme Court.\r\n\r\nBut if by that phrase the charge is made that I would appoint and\r\nthe Senate would confirm justices worthy to sit beside present\r\nmembers of the Court who understand those modern conditions, that I\r\nwill appoint justices who will not undertake to override the\r\njudgment of the Congress on legislative policy, that I will appoint\r\njustices who will act as justices and not as legislators--if the\r\nappointment of such justices can be called \"packing the Courts,\"\r\nthen I say that I and with me the vast majority of the American\r\npeople favor doing just that thing--now.\r\n\r\nIs it a dangerous precedent for the Congress to change the number\r\nof the justices?  The Congress has always had, and will have, that\r\npower.  The number of justices has been changed several times\r\nbefore, in the administration of John Adams and Thomas Jefferson--\r\nboth signers of the Declaration of Independence--Andrew Jackson,\r\nAbraham Lincoln and Ulysses S. Grant.\r\n\r\nI suggest only the addition of justices to the bench in accordance\r\nwith a clearly defined principle relating to a clearly defined age\r\nlimit.  Fundamentally, if in the future, America cannot trust the\r\nCongress it elects to refrain from abuse of our Constitutional\r\nusages, democracy will have failed far beyond the importance to it\r\nof any king of precedent concerning the judiciary.\r\n\r\nWe think it so much in the public interest to maintain a vigorous\r\njudiciary that we encourage the retirement of elderly judges by\r\noffering them a life pension at full salary.  Why then should we\r\nleave the fulfillment of this public policy to chance or make\r\nindependent on upon the desire or prejudice of any individual\r\njustice?\r\n\r\nIt is the clear intention of our public policy to provide for a\r\nconstant flow of new and younger blood into the judiciary.  Normally\r\nevery President appoints a large number of district and circuit\r\ncourt judges and a few members of the Supreme Court.  Until my first\r\nterm practically every President of the United States has appointed\r\nat least one member of the Supreme Court.  President Taft appointed\r\nfive members and named a Chief Justice; President Wilson, three;\r\nPresident Harding, four, including a Chief Justice; President\r\nCoolidge, one; President Hoover, three, including a Chief Justice.\r\n\r\nSuch a succession of appointments should have provided a Court\r\nwell-balanced as to age.  But chance and the disinclination of\r\nindividuals to leave the Supreme bench have now given us a Court in\r\nwhich five justices will be over seventy-five years of age before\r\nnext June and one over seventy.  Thus a sound public policy has been\r\ndefeated.\r\n\r\nI now propose that we establish by law an assurance against any\r\nsuch ill-balanced court in the future.  I propose that hereafter,\r\nwhen a judge reaches the age of seventy, a new and younger judge\r\nshall be added to the court automatically.  In this way I propose to\r\nenforce a sound public policy by law instead of leaving the\r\ncomposition of our federal courts, including the highest, to be\r\ndetermined by chance or the personal indecision of individuals.\r\n\r\nIf such a law as I propose is regarded as establishing a new\r\nprecedent, is it not a most desirable precedent?\r\n\r\nLike all lawyers, like all Americans, I regret the necessity of\r\nthis controversy.  But the welfare of the United States, and indeed\r\nof the Constitution itself, is what we all must think about first.\r\nOur difficulty with the Court today rises not from the Court as an\r\ninstitution but from human beings within it.  But we cannot yield\r\nour constitutional destiny to the personal judgment of a few men\r\nwho, being fearful of the future, would deny us the necessary means\r\nof dealing with the present.\r\n\r\nThis plan of mine is no attack on the Court; it seeks to restore\r\nthe Court to its rightful and historic place in our constitutional\r\ngovernment and to have it resume its high task of building anew on\r\nthe Constitution \"a system of living law.\"  The Court itself can\r\nbest undo what the Court has done.\r\n\r\nI have thus explained to you the reasons that lie behind our\r\nefforts to secure results by legislation within the Constitution.  I\r\nhope that thereby the difficult process of constitutional amendment\r\nmay be rendered unnecessary.  But let us examine the process.\r\n\r\nThere are many types of amendment proposed.  Each one is radically\r\ndifferent from the other.  There is no substantial groups within the\r\nCongress or outside it who are agreed on any single amendment.\r\n\r\nIt would take months or years to get substantial agreement upon the\r\ntype and language of the amendment.  It would take months and years\r\nthereafter to get a two-thirds majority in favor of that amendment\r\nin _both_ Houses of the Congress.\r\n\r\nThen would come the long course of ratification by three-fourths of\r\nall the states.  No amendment which any powerful economic interests\r\nor the leaders of any powerful political party have had reason to\r\noppose has ever been ratified within anything like a reasonable\r\ntime.  And thirteen states which contain only five percent of the\r\nvoting population can block ratification even though the thirty-\r\nfive states with ninety-five percent of the population are in favor\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nA very large percentage of newspaper publishers, Chambers of\r\nCommerce, Bar Association, Manufacturers' Associations, who are\r\ntrying to give the impression that they really do want a\r\nconstitutional amendment would be the first to exclaim as soon as\r\nan amendment was proposed, \"Oh!  I was for an amendment all right,\r\nbut this amendment you proposed is not the kind of amendment that I\r\nwas thinking about.  I am therefore, going to spend my time, my\r\nefforts and my money to block the amendment, although I would be\r\nawfully glad to help get some other kind of amendment ratified.\"\r\n\r\nTwo groups oppose my plan on the ground that they favor a\r\nconstitutional amendment.  The first includes those who\r\nfundamentally object to social and economic legislation along\r\nmodern lines.  This is the same group who during the campaign last\r\nFall tried to block the mandate of the people.\r\n\r\nNow they are making a last stand.  And the strategy of that last\r\nstand is to suggest the time-consuming process of amendment in\r\norder to kill off by delay the legislation demanded by the mandate.\r\n\r\nTo them I say:  I do not think you will be able long to fool the\r\nAmerican people as to your purposes.\r\n\r\nThe other groups is composed of those who honestly believe the\r\namendment process is the best and who would be willing to support a\r\nreasonable amendment if they could agree on one.\r\n\r\nTo them I say:  we cannot rely on an amendment as the immediate or\r\nonly answer to our present difficulties.  When the time comes for\r\naction, you will find that many of those who pretend to support you\r\nwill sabotage any constructive amendment which is proposed.  Look at\r\nthese strange bed-fellows of yours.  When before have you found them\r\nreally at your side in your fights for progress?\r\n\r\nAnd remember one thing more.  Even if an amendment were passed, and\r\neven if in the years to come it were to be ratified, its meaning\r\nwould depend upon the kind of justices who would be sitting on the\r\nSupreme Court bench.  An amendment, like the rest of the\r\nConstitution, is what the justices say it is rather than what its\r\nframers or you might hope it is.\r\n\r\nThis proposal of mine will not infringe in the slightest upon the\r\ncivil or religious liberties so dear to every American.\r\n\r\nMy record as Governor and President proves my devotion to those\r\nliberties.  You who know me can have no fear that I would tolerate\r\nthe destruction by any branch of government of any part of our\r\nheritage of freedom.\r\n\r\nThe present attempt by those opposed to progress to play upon the\r\nfears of danger to personal liberty brings again to mind that crude\r\nand cruel strategy tried by the same opposition to frighten the\r\nworkers of America in a pay-envelope propaganda against the Social\r\nSecurity Law.  The workers were not fooled by that propaganda then.\r\nThe people of America will not be fooled by such propaganda now.\r\n\r\nI am in favor of action through legislation:\r\n\r\nFirst, because I believe that it can be passed at this session of\r\nthe Congress.\r\n\r\nSecond, because it will provide a reinvigorated, liberal-minded\r\njudiciary necessary to furnish quicker and cheaper justice from\r\nbottom to top.\r\n\r\nThird, because it will provide a series of federal courts willing\r\nto enforce the Constitution as written, and unwilling to assert\r\nlegislative powers by writing into it their own political and\r\neconomic policies.\r\n\r\nDuring the past half century the balance of power between the three\r\ngreat branches of the federal government, has been tipped out of\r\nbalance by the courts in direct contradiction of the high purposes\r\nof the framers of the Constitution.  It is my purpose to restore\r\nthat balance.  You who know me will accept my solemn assurance that\r\nin a world in which democracy is under attack, I seek to make\r\nAmerican democracy succeed.  You and I will do our part.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOctober 12, 1937.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Friends:\r\n\r\nThis afternoon I have issued a Proclamation calling a special\r\nsession of the Congress to convene on Monday, November 15, 1937.\r\n\r\nI do this in order to give to the Congress an opportunity to\r\nconsider important legislation before the regular session in\r\nJanuary, and to enable the Congress to avoid a lengthy session next\r\nyear, extending through the summer.\r\n\r\nI know that many enemies of democracy will say that it is bad for\r\nbusiness, bad for the tranquility of the country, to have a special\r\nsession--even one beginning only six weeks before the regular\r\nsession.  But I have never had sympathy with the point of view that\r\na session of the Congress is an unfortunate intrusion of what they\r\ncall \"politics\" into our national affairs.  Those who do not like\r\ndemocracy want to keep legislators at home.  But the Congress is an\r\nessential instrument of democratic government; and democratic\r\ngovernment can never be considered an intruder into the affairs of\r\na democratic nation.\r\n\r\nI shall ask this special session to consider immediately certain\r\nimportant legislation which my recent trip through the nation\r\nconvinces me the American people immediately need.  This does not\r\nmean that other legislation, to which I am not referring tonight,\r\nis not important for our national well-being.  But other legislation\r\ncan be more readily discussed at the regular session.\r\n\r\nAnyone charged with proposing or judging national policies should\r\nhave first-hand knowledge of the nation as a whole.\r\n\r\nThat is why again this year I have taken trips to all parts of the\r\ncountry.  Last spring I visited the Southwest.  This summer I made\r\nseveral trips in the East.  Now I am just back from a trip from a\r\ntrip all the way across the continent, and later this autumn I hope\r\nto pay my annual visit to the Southeast.\r\n\r\nFor a President especially it is a duty to think in national terms.\r\n\r\nHe must think not only of this year but of future years, when\r\nsomeone else will be President.\r\n\r\nHe must look beyond the average of the prosperity and well-being of\r\nthe country, for averages easily cover up danger spots of poverty\r\nand instability.\r\n\r\nHe must not let the country be deceived by a merely temporary\r\nprosperity which depends on wasteful exploitation of resources\r\nwhich cannot last.\r\n\r\nHe must think not only of keeping us out of war today, but also of\r\nkeeping us out of war in generations to come.\r\n\r\nThe kind of prosperity we want is the sound and permanent kind\r\nwhich is not built up temporarily at the expense of any section or\r\nany group.  And the kind of peace we want is the sound and permanent\r\nkind, which is built on the cooperative search for peace by all the\r\nnations which want peace.\r\n\r\nThe other day I was asked to state my outstanding impression gained\r\non this recent trip.  I said that it seemed to me to be the general\r\nunderstanding on the part of the average citizen of the broad\r\nobjectives and policies which I have just outlined.\r\n\r\nFive years of fierce discussion and debate--five years of\r\ninformation through the radio and the moving picture--have taken\r\nthe whole nation to school in the nation's business.  Even those who\r\nhave most attacked our objectives have, by their very criticism,\r\nencouraged the mass of our citizens to think about and understand\r\nthe issues involved, and, understanding, to approve.\r\n\r\nOut of that process, we have learned to think as a nation.  And out\r\nof that process we have learned to feel ourselves a nation.  As\r\nnever before in our history, each section of America says to every\r\nother section, \"Thy people shall be my people.\"\r\n\r\nFor most of the country this has been a good year--better in\r\ndollars and cents than for many years--far better in the soundness\r\nof its prosperity.  And everywhere I went I found particular\r\noptimism about the good effect on business which is expected from\r\nthe steady spending by farmers of the largest farm income in many\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nBut we have not yet done all that must be done to make this\r\nprosperity stable.  The people of the United States were checked in\r\ntheir efforts to prevent future piling up of huge agricultural\r\nsurpluses and the tumbling prices which inevitably follow them.\r\nThey were checked in their efforts to secure reasonable minimum\r\nwages and maximum hours and the end of child labor.  And because\r\nthey were checked, many groups in many parts of the country still\r\nhave less purchasing power and a lower standard of living than the\r\nnation as a whole can permanently allow.\r\n\r\nAmericans realize these facts.  That is why they ask government not\r\nto stop governing simply because prosperity has come back a long\r\nway.\r\n\r\nThey do not look on government as an interloper in their affairs.\r\nOn the contrary, they regard it as the most effective form of\r\norganized self-help.\r\n\r\nSometimes I get bored sitting in Washington hearing certain people\r\ntalk and talk about all that government ought _not_ do--people who\r\ngot all _they_ wanted from government back in the days when the\r\nfinancial institutions and the railroads were being bailed out by\r\nthe government in 1933.  It is refreshing to go out through the\r\ncountry and feel the common wisdom that the time to repair the roof\r\nis when the sun is shining.\r\n\r\nThey want the financial budget balanced.  But they want the human\r\nbudget balanced as well.  They want to set up a national economy\r\nwhich balances itself with as little government subsidy as\r\npossible, for they realize that persistent subsidies ultimately\r\nbankrupt their government.\r\n\r\nThey are less concerned that every detail be immediately right than\r\nthey are that the direction be right.  They know that just so long\r\nas we are traveling on the right road, it does not make much\r\ndifference if occasionally we hit a \"Thank you marm.\"\r\n\r\nThe overwhelming majority of our citizens who live by agriculture\r\nare thinking very clearly how they want government to help them in\r\nconnection with the production of crops.  They want government help\r\nin two ways:  first, in the control of surpluses, and, second, in\r\nthe proper use of land.\r\n\r\nThe other day a reporter told me that he had never been able to\r\nunderstand why the government seeks to curtail crop production and,\r\nat the same time, to open up new irrigated acres.\r\n\r\nHe was confusing two totally separate objectives.\r\n\r\nCrop surplus control relates to the total amount of any major crop\r\ngrown in the whole nation on all cultivated land--good or bad--\r\ncontrol by the cooperation of the crop growers and with the help of\r\nthe government.  Land use, on the other hand, is a policy of\r\nproviding each farmer with the best quality and type of land we\r\nhave, or can make available, for his part in that total production.\r\nAdding good new land for diversified crops is offset by abandoning\r\npoor land now uneconomically farmed.\r\n\r\nThe total amount of production largely determines the price of the\r\ncrop, and, therefore, the difference between comfort and misery for\r\nthe farmer.\r\n\r\nIf we Americans were foolish enough to run every shoe factory\r\ntwenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, we would soon have more\r\nshoes than the nation could possibly buy--a surplus of shoes so\r\ngreat that it would have to be destroyed, or given away, or sold at\r\nprices far below the cost of production.  That simple law of supply\r\nand demand equally affects the price of all our major crops.\r\n\r\nYou and I have heard big manufacturers talk about control of\r\nproduction by the farmer as an indefensible \"economy of scarcity.\"\r\nAnd yet these same manufacturers never hesitate to shut down their\r\nown huge plants, throw men out of work, and cut down the purchasing\r\npower of whole communities whenever they think that they must\r\nadjust their production to an oversupply of the goods they make.\r\nWhen it is their baby who has the measles, they call it not \"an\r\neconomy of scarcity\" but \"sound business judgment.\"\r\n\r\nOf course, speaking seriously, what you and I want is such\r\ngovernmental rules of the game that labor and agriculture and\r\nindustry will all produce a balanced abundance without waste.\r\n\r\nSo we intend this winter to find a way to prevent four-and-a-half\r\ncent cotton, nine cent corn and thirty cent wheat--with all the\r\ndisaster those prices mean for all of us--to prevent those prices\r\nfrom ever coming back again.  To do that, the farmers themselves\r\nwant to cooperate to build an all-weather farm program so that in\r\nthe long run prices will be more stable.  They believe this can be\r\ndone, and the national budget kept out of the red.\r\n\r\nAnd when we have found that way to protect the farmers' prices from\r\nthe effects of alternating crop surpluses and crop scarcities, we\r\nshall also have found the way to protect the nation's food supply\r\nfrom the effects of the same fluctuation.  We ought always to have\r\nenough food at prices within the reach of the consuming public.  For\r\nthe consumers in the cities of America, we must find a way to help\r\nthe farmers to store up in years of plenty enough to avoid hardship\r\nin the years of scarcity.\r\n\r\nOur land use policy is a different thing.  I have just visited much\r\nof the work that the national government is doing to stop soil\r\nerosion, to save our forests, to prevent floods, to produce\r\nelectric power for more general use, and to give people a chance to\r\nmove from poor land on to better land by irrigating thousands of\r\nacres that need only water to provide an opportunity to make a good\r\nliving.\r\n\r\nI saw bare and burned hillsides where only a few years ago great\r\nforests were growing.  They are now being planted to young trees,\r\nnot only to stop erosion, but to provide a lumber supply for the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nI saw C.C.C. boys and W.P.A. workers building check-dams and small\r\nponds and terraces to raise the water table and make it possible\r\nfor farms and villages to remain in safety where they now are.  I\r\nsaw the harnessing of the turbulent Missouri, muddy with the\r\ntopsoil of many states.  And I saw barges on new channels carrying\r\nproduce and freight athwart the nation.\r\n\r\nLet me give you two simple illustrations of why government projects\r\nof this type have a national importance for the whole country.\r\n\r\nIn the Boise Valley in Idaho I saw a district which had been\r\nrecently irrigated to enormous fertility so that a family can now\r\nmake a pretty good living from forty acres of its land.  Many of the\r\nfamilies, who are making good in that valley today, moved there\r\nfrom a thousand miles away.  They came from the dust strip that runs\r\nthrough the middle of the nation all the way from the Canadian\r\nborder to Mexico, a strip which includes large portions of ten\r\nstates.  That valley in western Idaho, therefore, assumes at once a\r\nnational importance as a second chance for willing farmers.  And,\r\nyear by year, we propose to add more valleys to take care of\r\nthousands of other families who need the same kind of second chance\r\nin new green pastures.\r\n\r\nThe other illustration was at the Grand Coulee Dam in the state of\r\nWashington.  The engineer in charge told me that almost half of the\r\nwhole cost of that dam to date had been spent for materials that\r\nwere manufactured east of the Mississippi River, giving employment\r\nand wages to thousands of industrial workers in the eastern third\r\nof the nation, two thousand miles away.\r\n\r\nAll of this work needs, of course, a more businesslike system of\r\nplanning and greater foresight than we use today.\r\n\r\nThat is why I recommended to the last session of the Congress the\r\ncreation of seven planning regions, in which local people will\r\noriginate and coordinate recommendations as to the kind of this\r\nwork of this kind to be done in their particular regions.  The\r\nCongress will, of course, determine the projects to be selected\r\nwithin the budget limits.\r\n\r\nTo carry out any twentieth century program, we must give the\r\nExecutive branch of the government twentieth century machinery to\r\nwork with.  I recognize that democratic processes are necessarily\r\nand rightly slower than dictatorial processes.  But I refuse to\r\nbelieve that democratic processes need be dangerously slow.\r\n\r\nFor many years we have all known that the Executive and\r\nAdministrative departments of the government in Washington are a\r\nhiggledy-piggledy patchwork of duplicate responsibilities and\r\noverlapping powers.  The reorganization of this vast government\r\nmachinery which I proposed to the Congress last winter does not\r\nconflict with the principle of the democratic process, as some\r\npeople say.  It only makes that process work more efficiently.\r\n\r\nOn my recent trip many people have talked to me about the millions\r\nof men and women and children who still work at insufficient wages\r\nand overlong hours.\r\n\r\nAmerican industry has searched the outside world to find new\r\nmarkets--but it can create on its very doorstep the biggest and\r\nmost permanent market it has ever had.  It needs the reduction of\r\ntrade barriers to improve its foreign markets, but it should not\r\noverlook the chance to reduce the domestic trade barrier right\r\nhere--right away--without waiting for any treaty.  A few more\r\ndollars a week in wages, a better distribution of jobs with a\r\nshorter working day will almost overnight make millions of our\r\nlowest-paid workers actual buyers of billions of dollars of\r\nindustrial and farm products.  That increased volume of sales ought\r\nto lessen other cost of production so much that even a considerable\r\nincrease in labor costs can be absorbed without imposing higher\r\nprices on the consumer.\r\n\r\nI am a firm believer in fully adequate pay for all labor.  But right\r\nnow I am most greatly concerned in increasing the pay of the\r\nlowest-paid labor--those who are our most numerous consuming group\r\nbut who today do not make enough to maintain a decent standard of\r\nliving or to buy the food, and the clothes and the other articles\r\nnecessary to keep our factories and farms fully running.\r\n\r\nFarsighted businessmen already understand and agree with this\r\npolicy.  They agree also that no one section of the country can\r\npermanently benefit itself, or the rest of the country, by\r\nmaintaining standards of wages and hours far inferior to other\r\nsections of the country.\r\n\r\nMost businessmen, big and little, know that their government\r\nneither wants to put them out of business nor to prevent them from\r\nearning a decent profit.  In spite of the alarms of a few who seek\r\nto regain control of American life, most businessmen, big and\r\nlittle, know that their government is trying to make property more\r\nsecure than ever before by giving every family a real chance to\r\nhave a property stake in the nation.\r\n\r\nWhatever danger there may be to the property and profits of the\r\nmany, if there be any danger, comes not from government's attitude\r\ntoward business but from restraints now imposed upon business by\r\nprivate monopolies and financial oligarchies.  The average\r\nbusinessman knows that a high cost of living is a great deterrent\r\nto business and that business prosperity depends much upon a low\r\nprice policy which encourages the widest possible consumption.  As\r\none of the country's leading economists recently said, \"The\r\ncontinuance of business recovery in the United States depends far\r\nmore upon business policies, business pricing policies, than it\r\ndoes on anything that may be done, or not done, in Washington.\"\r\n\r\nOur competitive system is, of course, not altogether competitive.\r\nAnybody who buys any large quantity of manufactured goods knows\r\nthis, whether it be the government or an individual buyer.  We have\r\nanti-trust laws, to be sure, but they have not been adequate to\r\ncheck the growth of many monopolies.  Whether or not they might have\r\nbeen adequate originally, interpretation by the courts and the\r\ndifficulties and delays of legal procedure have now definitely\r\nlimited their effectiveness.\r\n\r\nWe are already studying how to strengthen our anti-trust laws in\r\norder to end monopoly--not to hurt but to free legitimate business.\r\n\r\nI have touched briefly on these important subjects, which, taken\r\ntogether, make a program for the immediate future.  To attain it,\r\nlegislation is necessary.\r\n\r\nAs we plan today for the creation of ever higher standards of\r\nliving for the people of the United States, we are aware that our\r\nplans may be most seriously affected by events in the world outside\r\nour borders.\r\n\r\nBy a series of trade agreements, we have been attempting to\r\nrecreate the trade of the world which plays so important a part in\r\nour domestic prosperity; but we know that if the world outside our\r\nborders falls into the chaos of war, world trade will be completely\r\ndisrupted.\r\n\r\nNor can we view with indifference the destruction of civilized\r\nvalues throughout the world.  We seek peace, not only for our\r\ngeneration but also for the generation of our children.\r\n\r\nWe seek for them the continuance of world civilization in order\r\nthat their American civilization may continue to be invigorated by\r\nthe achievements of civilized men and women in the rest of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nI want our great democracy to be wise enough to realize that\r\naloofness from war is not promoted by unawareness of war.  In a\r\nworld of mutual suspicions, peace must be affirmatively reached\r\nfor.  It cannot just be wished for.  And it cannot just be waited\r\nfor.\r\n\r\nWe have now made known our willingness to attend a conference of\r\nthe parties to the Nine Power Treaty of 1922--the Treaty of\r\nWashington--of which we are one of the original signatories.  The\r\npurpose of this conference will be to seek by agreement a solution\r\nof the present situation in China.  In efforts to find that\r\nsolution, it is our purpose to cooperate with the other signatories\r\nto this Treaty, including China and Japan.\r\n\r\nSuch cooperation would be an example of one of the possible paths\r\nto follow in our search for means toward peace throughout the whole\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThe development of civilization and of human welfare is based on\r\nthe acceptance by individuals of certain fundamental decencies in\r\ntheir relations with each other.  The development of peace in the\r\nworld is dependent similarly on the acceptance by nations of\r\ncertain fundamental decencies in their relations with each other.\r\n\r\nUltimately, I hope _each_ nation will accept the fact that\r\nviolations of these rules of conduct are an injury to the well-\r\nbeing of _all_ nations.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, remember that from 1913 to 1921, I personally was fairly\r\nclose to world events, and in that period, while I learned much of\r\nwhat to do, I also learned much of what _not_ to do.\r\n\r\nThe common sense, the intelligence of America agree with my\r\nstatement that \"America hates war.  America hopes for peace.\r\nTherefore, America actively engages in the search for peace.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApril 14, 1938.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Friends:\r\n\r\nFive months have gone by since I last spoke to the people of the\r\nnation about the state of the nation.\r\n\r\nI had hoped to be able to defer this talk until next week because,\r\nas we all know, this is Holy Week.  But what I want to say to you,\r\nthe people of the country, is of such immediate need and relates so\r\nclosely to the lives of human beings and the prevention of human\r\nsuffering that I have felt that there should be no delay.  In this\r\ndecision I have been strengthened by the thought that by speaking\r\ntonight there may be greater peace of mind and that the hope of\r\nEaster may be more real at firesides everywhere, and therefore that\r\nit is not inappropriate to encourage peace when so many of us are\r\nthinking of the Prince of Peace.\r\n\r\nFive years ago we faced a very serious problem of economic and\r\nsocial recovery.  For four and a half years that recovery proceeded\r\napace.  It is only in the past seven months that it has received a\r\nvisible setback.\r\n\r\nAnd it is only within the past two months, as we have waited\r\npatiently to see whether the forces of business itself would\r\ncounteract it, that it has become apparent that government itself\r\ncan no longer safely fail to take aggressive government steps to\r\nmeet it.\r\n\r\nThis recession has not returned us the disasters and suffering of\r\nthe beginning of 1933.  Your money in the bank is safe; farmers are\r\nno longer in deep distress and have greater purchasing power;\r\ndangers of security speculation have been minimized; national\r\nincome is almost 50 percent higher than in 1932; and government has\r\nan established and accepted responsibility for relief.\r\n\r\nBut I know that many of you have lost your jobs or have seen your\r\nfriends or members of your families lose their jobs, and I do not\r\npropose that the government shall pretend not to see these things.\r\nI know that the effect of our present difficulties has been uneven;\r\nthat they have affected some groups and some localities seriously,\r\nbut that they have been scarcely felt in others.  But I conceive the\r\nfirst duty of government is to protect the economic welfare of all\r\nthe people in all sections and in all groups.  I said in my message\r\nopening the last session of the Congress that if private enterprise\r\ndid not provide jobs this spring, government would take up the\r\nslack--that I would not let the people down.  We have all learned\r\nthe lesson that government cannot afford to wait until it has lost\r\nthe power to act.\r\n\r\nTherefore, my friends, I have sent a message of far-reaching\r\nimportance to the Congress.  I want to read to you tonight certain\r\npassages from that message, and to talk with you about them.\r\n\r\nIn that message I analyzed the causes of the collapse of 1929 in\r\nthese words: \"over-speculation in and overproduction of practically\r\nevery article or instrument used by man. . . millions of people, to\r\nbe sure, had been put to work, but the products of their hands had\r\nexceeded the purchasing power of their pocketbooks. . . .  Under the\r\ninexorable law of supply and demand, supplies so overran demand\r\nwhich would pay that production was compelled to stop.  Unemployment\r\nand closed factories resulted.  Hence the tragic years from 1929 to\r\n1933.\"\r\n\r\nI pointed out to the Congress that the national income--not the\r\ngovernment's income but the total of the income of all the\r\nindividual citizens and families of the United States--every\r\nfarmer, every worker, every banker, every professional man and\r\nevery person who lived on income derived from investments--that\r\nnational income had amounted, in the year 1929, to eighty-one\r\nbillion dollars.  By 1932 this had fallen to thirty-eight billion\r\ndollars.  Gradually, and up to a few months ago, it had risen to a\r\ntotal, an annual total; of sixty-eight billion dollars--a pretty\r\ngood come-back from the low point.\r\n\r\nI then said this to the Congress:\r\n\r\n\"But the very vigor of the recovery in both durable goods and\r\nconsumers' goods brought into the picture early in certain highly\r\nundesirable practices, which were in large part responsible for the\r\neconomic decline which began in the later months of that year.\r\nAgain production outran the ability to buy.\r\n\r\n\"There were many reasons for this overproduction.  One of them was\r\nfear--fear of war abroad, fear of inflation, fear of nation-wide\r\nstrikes.  None of these fears have been borne out.\r\n\r\n\". . .Production in many important lines of goods outran the\r\nability of the public to purchase them.  For example, through the\r\nwinter and spring of 1937 cotton factories in hundreds of cases\r\nwere running on a three-shift basis, piling up cotton goods in the\r\nfactory, and in the hands of middle men and retailers.  For example,\r\nalso, automobile manufacturers not only turned out a normal\r\nincrease of finished cars, but encouraged the normal increase to\r\nrun into abnormal figures, using every known method to push their\r\nsales.  This meant, of course, that the steel mills of the nation\r\nran on a twenty-four hour basis, and the tire companies and cotton\r\nfactories and glass factories and others speeded up to meet the\r\nsame type of abnormally stimulated demand.  The buying power of the\r\nnation lagged behind.\r\n\r\n\"Thus by the autumn of 1937, last autumn, the nation again had\r\nstocks on hand which the consuming public could not buy because the\r\npurchasing power of the consuming public had not kept pace with the\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\n\"During the same period. . . the prices of many vital products had\r\nrisen faster than was warranted. . . .  In the case of many\r\ncommodities the price to the consumer was raised well above the\r\ninflationary boom prices of 1929.  In many lines of goods and\r\nmaterials, prices got so high that buyers and builders ceased to\r\nbuy or to build.\r\n\r\n\". . .  The economic process of getting out the raw materials,\r\nputting them through the manufacturing and finishing processes,\r\nselling them to the retailers, selling them to the consumer, and\r\nfinally using them, got completely out of balance.\r\n\r\n\". . .  The laying off of workers came upon us last autumn and has\r\nbeen continuing at such a pace ever since that all of us,\r\ngovernment and banking and business and workers, and those faced\r\nwith destitution, recognize the need for action.\"\r\n\r\nAll of this I said to the Congress today and I repeat it to you,\r\nthe people of the country tonight.\r\n\r\nI went on to point out to the Senate and the House of\r\nRepresentatives that all the energies of government and business\r\nmust be directed to increasing the national income, to putting more\r\npeople into private jobs, to giving security and a feeling of\r\nsecurity to all people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nI am constantly thinking of all our people--unemployed and employed\r\nalike--of their human problems of food and clothing and homes and\r\neducation and health and old age.  You and I agree that security is\r\nour greatest need; the chance to work, the opportunity of making a\r\nreasonable profit in our business--whether it be a very small\r\nbusiness or a larger one--the possibility of selling our farm\r\nproducts for enough money for our families to live on decently.  I\r\nknow these are the things that decide the well-being of all our\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I am determined to do all in my power to help you attain\r\nthat security and because I know that the people themselves have a\r\ndeep conviction that secure prosperity of that kind cannot be a\r\nlasting one except on a basis of business fair dealing and a basis\r\nwhere all from the top to the bottom share in the prosperity.  I\r\nrepeated to the Congress today that neither it nor the Chief\r\nExecutive can afford \"to weaken or destroy great reforms which,\r\nduring the past five years, have been effected on behalf of the\r\nAmerican people.  In our rehabilitation of the banking structure and\r\nof agriculture, in our provisions for adequate and cheaper credit\r\nfor all types of business, in our acceptance of national\r\nresponsibility for unemployment relief, in our strengthening of the\r\ncredit of state and local government, in our encouragement of\r\nhousing, and slum clearance and home ownership, in our supervision\r\nof stock exchanges and public utility holding companies and the\r\nissuance of new securities, in our provision for social security,\r\nthe electorate of America wants no backward steps taken.\r\n\r\n\"We have recognized the right of labor to free organization, to\r\ncollective bargaining; and machinery for the handling of labor\r\nrelations is now in existence.  The principles are established even\r\nthough we can all admit that, through the evolution of time,\r\nadministration and practices can be improved.  Such improvement can\r\ncome about most quickly and most peacefully through sincere efforts\r\nto understand and assist on the part of labor leaders and employers\r\nalike.\r\n\r\n\"The never-ceasing evolution of human society will doubtless bring\r\nforth new problems which will require new adjustments.  Our\r\nimmediate task is to consolidate and maintain the gains achieved.\r\n\r\n\"In this situation there is no reason and no occasion for any\r\nAmerican to allow his fears to be aroused or his energy and\r\nenterprise to be paralyzed by doubt or uncertainty.\"\r\n\r\nI came to the conclusion that the present-day problem calls for\r\naction both by the government and by the people, that we suffer\r\nprimarily from a failure of consumer demand because of lack of\r\nbuying power.  Therefore it is up to us to create an economic\r\nupturn.\r\n\r\n\"How and where can and should the government help to start an\r\nupward spiral?\"\r\n\r\nI went on in my message today to propose three groups of measures\r\nand I will summarize my recommendations.\r\n\r\nFirst, I asked for certain appropriations which are intended to\r\nkeep the government expenditures for work relief and similar\r\npurposes during the coming fiscal year at the same rate of\r\nexpenditure as at present.  That includes additional money for the\r\nWorks Progress Administration; additional funds for the Farm\r\nSecurity Administration; additional allotments for the national\r\nYouth Administration, and more money for the Civilian Conservation\r\nCorps, in order that it can maintain the existing number of camps\r\nnow in operation.\r\n\r\nThese appropriations, made necessary by increased unemployment,\r\nwill cost about a billion and a quarter dollars more than the\r\nestimates which I sent to the Congress on the third of January .\r\n\r\nSecond, I told the Congress that the administration proposes to\r\nmake additional bank reserves available for the credit needs of the\r\ncountry.  About one billion four hundred million dollars of gold now\r\nin the treasury will be used to pay these additional expenses of\r\nthe government, and three-quarters of a billion dollars of\r\nadditional credit will be made available to the banks by reducing\r\nthe reserves now required by the Federal Reserve Board.\r\n\r\nThese two steps--taking care of relief needs and adding to bank\r\ncredits--are in our best judgment insufficient by themselves to\r\nstart the nation on a sustained upward movement.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I came to the third kind of government action which I\r\nconsider to be vital.  I said to the Congress:\r\n\r\n\"You and I cannot afford to equip ourselves with two rounds of\r\nammunition where three rounds are necessary.  If we stop at relief\r\nand credit, we may find ourselves without ammunition before the\r\nenemy is routed.  If we are fully equipped with the third round of\r\nammunition, we stand to win the battle against adversity.\"\r\n\r\nThis third proposal is to make definite additions to the purchasing\r\npower of the nation by providing new work over and above the\r\ncontinuing of the old work.\r\n\r\nFirst, to enable the United States Housing Authority to undertake\r\nthe immediate construction of about three hundred million dollars\r\nof additional slum clearance projects.\r\n\r\nSecond, to renew a public works program by starting as quickly as\r\npossible about one billion dollars worth of needed permanent public\r\nimprovements in our states, and their counties and cities.\r\n\r\nThird, to add one hundred million dollars to the estimate for\r\nfederal aid highways in excess of the amount I recommended in\r\nJanuary.\r\n\r\nFourth, to add thirty-seven million dollars over and above the\r\nformer estimate of sixty-three million for flood control and\r\nreclamation.\r\n\r\nFifth, to add twenty-five million dollars additional for federal\r\nbuildings in various parts of the country.\r\n\r\nIn recommending this program I am thinking not only of the\r\nimmediate economic needs of the people of the nation, but also of\r\ntheir personal liberties--the most precious possession of all\r\nAmericans.  I am thinking of our democracy and of the recent trend\r\nin other parts of the world away from the democratic ideal.\r\n\r\nDemocracy has disappeared in several other great nations--\r\ndisappeared not because the people of those nations disliked\r\ndemocracy, but because they had grown tired of unemployment and\r\ninsecurity, of seeing their children hungry while they sat helpless\r\nin the face of government confusion and government weakness through\r\nlack of leadership in government.  Finally, in desperation, they\r\nchose to sacrifice liberty in the hope of getting something to eat.\r\nWe in America know that our own democratic institutions can be\r\npreserved and made to work.  But in order to preserve them we need\r\nto act together, to meet the problems of the nation boldly, and to\r\nprove that the practical operation of democratic government is\r\nequal to the task of protecting the security of the people.\r\n\r\nNot only our future economic soundness but the very soundness of\r\nour democratic institutions depends on the determination of our\r\ngovernment to give employment to idle men.  The people of America\r\nare in agreement in defending their liberties at any cost, and the\r\nfirst line of that defense lies in the protection of economic\r\nsecurity.  Your government, seeking to protect democracy, must prove\r\nthat government is stronger than the forces of business depression.\r\n\r\nHistory proves that dictatorships do not grow out of strong and\r\nsuccessful governments but out of weak and helpless governments.  If\r\nby democratic methods people get a government strong enough to\r\nprotect them from fear and starvation, their democracy succeeds,\r\nbut if they do not, they grow impatient.  Therefore, the only sure\r\nbulwark of continuing liberty is a government strong enough to\r\nprotect the interests of the people, and a people strong enough and\r\nwell enough informed to maintain its sovereign control over its\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nWe are a rich Nation; we can afford to pay for security and\r\nprosperity without having to sacrifice our liberties into the\r\nbargain.\r\n\r\nIn the first century of our republic we were short of capital,\r\nshort of workers and short of industrial production; but we were\r\nrich in free land, free timber and free mineral wealth.  The federal\r\ngovernment rightly assumed the duty of promoting business and\r\nrelieving depression by giving subsidies of land and other\r\nresources.\r\n\r\nThus, from our earliest days we have had a tradition of substantial\r\ngovernment help to our system of private enterprise.  But today the\r\ngovernment no longer has vast tracts of rich land to give away and\r\nwe have discovered, too, that we must spend large sums of money to\r\nconserve our land from further erosion and our forests from further\r\ndepletion.  The situation is also very different from the old days,\r\nbecause now we have plenty of capital, banks and insurance\r\ncompanies loaded with idle money; plenty of industrial productive\r\ncapacity and many millions of workers looking for jobs.  It is\r\nfollowing tradition as well as necessity, if government strives to\r\nput idle money and idle men to work, to increase our public wealth\r\nand to build up the health and strength of the people--and to help\r\nour system of private enterprise to function.\r\n\r\nIt is going to cost something to get out of this recession this way\r\nbut the profit of getting out of it will pay for the cost several\r\ntimes over.  Lost working time is lost money.  Every day that a\r\nworkman is unemployed, or a machine is unused, or a business\r\norganization is marking time, it is a loss to the nation.  Because\r\nof idle men and idle machines this Nation lost one hundred billion\r\ndollars between 1929 and the Spring of 1933, in less than four\r\nyears.  This year you, the people of this country, are making about\r\ntwelve billion dollars less than last year.\r\n\r\nIf you think back to the experiences of the early years of this\r\nadministration you will remember the doubts and fears expressed\r\nabout the rising expenses of government.  But to the surprise of the\r\ndoubters, as we proceeded to carry on the program which included\r\nPublic Works and Work Relief, the country grew richer instead of\r\npoorer.\r\n\r\nIt is worthwhile to remember that the annual national people's\r\nincome was thirty billion dollars more last year in 1937 than it\r\nwas in 1932.  It is true that the national debt increased sixteen\r\nbillion dollars, but remember that in that increase must be\r\nincluded several billion dollars worth of assets which eventually\r\nwill reduce that debt and that many billion dollars of permanent\r\npublic improvements--schools, roads, bridges, tunnels, public\r\nbuildings, parks and a host of other things--meet your eye in every\r\none of the thirty-one hundred counties in the United States.\r\n\r\nNo doubt you will be told that the government spending program of\r\nthe past five years did not cause the increase in our national\r\nincome.  They will tell you that business revived because of private\r\nspending and investment.  That is true in part, for the government\r\nspent only a small part of the total.  But that government spending\r\nacted as a trigger to set off private activity.  That is why the\r\ntotal addition to our national production and national income has\r\nbeen so much greater than the contribution of the government\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of that thought I said to the Congress today:\r\n\r\n\"I want to make it clear that we do not believe that we can get an\r\nadequate rise in national income merely by investing, and lending\r\nor spending public funds.  It is essential in our economy that\r\nprivate funds must be put to work and all of us recognize that such\r\nfunds are entitled to a fair profit.\"\r\n\r\nAs national income rises, \"let us not forget that government\r\nexpenditures will go down and government tax receipts will go up.\"\r\n\r\nThe government contribution of land that we once made to business\r\nwas the land of all the people.  And the government contribution of\r\nmoney which we now make to business ultimately comes out of the\r\nlabor of all the people.  It is, therefore, only sound morality, as\r\nwell as a sound distribution of buying power, that the benefits of\r\nthe prosperity coming from this use of the money of all the people\r\nought to be distributed among all the people--at the bottom as well\r\nas at the top.  Consequently, I am again expressing my hope that the\r\nCongress will enact at this session a wage and hour bill putting a\r\nfloor under industrial wages and a limit on working hours--to\r\nensure a better distribution of our prosperity, a better\r\ndistribution of available work, and a sounder distribution of\r\nbuying power.\r\n\r\nYou may get all kinds of impressions in regard to the total cost of\r\nthis new program, or in regard to the amount that will be added to\r\nthe net national debt.\r\n\r\nIt is a big program.  Last autumn in a sincere effort to bring\r\ngovernment expenditures and government income into closer balance,\r\nthe Budget I worked out called for sharp decreases in government\r\nspending.\r\n\r\nIn the light of present conditions those estimates were far too\r\nlow.  This new program adds two billion and sixty-two million\r\ndollars to direct treasury expenditures and another nine hundred\r\nand fifty million dollars to government loans--the latter sum,\r\nbecause they are loans, will come back to the treasury in the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nThe net effect on the debt of the government is this--between now\r\nand July 1, 1939--fifteen months away--the treasury will have to\r\nraise less than a billion and a half dollars of new money.\r\n\r\nSuch an addition to the net debt of the United States need not give\r\nconcern to any citizen, for it will return to the people of the\r\nUnited States many times over in increased buying power and\r\neventually in much greater government tax receipts because of the\r\nincrease in the citizen income.\r\n\r\nWhat I said to the Congress in the close of my message I repeat to\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n\"Let us unanimously recognize the fact that the federal debt,\r\nwhether it be twenty-five billions or forty billions, can only be\r\npaid if the nation obtains a vastly increased citizen income.  I\r\nrepeat that if this citizen income can be raised to eighty billion\r\ndollars a year the national government and the overwhelming\r\nmajority of state and local governments will be definitely 'out of\r\nthe red.'  The higher the national income goes the faster will we be\r\nable to reduce the total of federal and state and local debts.\r\nViewed from every angle, today's purchasing power--the citizens'\r\nincome of today--is not at this time sufficient to drive the\r\neconomic system of America at higher speed.  Responsibility of\r\ngovernment requires us at this time to supplement the normal\r\nprocesses and in so supplementing them to make sure that the\r\naddition is adequate.  We must start again on a long steady upward\r\nincline in national income.\r\n\r\n\". . .  And in that process, which I believe is ready to start, let\r\nus avoid the pitfalls of the past--the overproduction, the\r\noverspeculation, and indeed all the extremes which we did not\r\nsucceed in avoiding in 1929.  In all of this, government cannot and\r\nshould not act alone.  Business must help.  And I am sure business\r\nwill help.\r\n\r\n\"We need more than the materials of recovery.  We need a united\r\nnational will.\r\n\r\n\"We need to recognize nationally that the demands of no group,\r\nhowever just, can be satisfied unless that group is prepared to\r\nshare in finding a way to produce the income from which they and\r\nall other groups can be paid. . . .  You, as the Congress, I, as the\r\nPresident, must by virtue of our offices, seek the national good by\r\npreserving the balance between all groups and all sections.\r\n\r\n\"We have at our disposal the national resources, the money, the\r\nskill of hand and head to raise our economic level--our citizens'\r\nincome.  Our capacity is limited only by our ability to work\r\ntogether.  What is needed is the will.\r\n\r\n\"The time has come to bring that will into action with every\r\ndriving force at our command.  And I am determined to do my share.\r\n\r\n\". . .  Certain positive requirements seem to me to accompany the\r\nwill--if we have that will.\r\n\r\n\"There is placed on all of us the duty of self-restraint. . . .\r\nThat is the discipline of a democracy.  Every patriotic citizen must\r\nsay to himself or herself, that immoderate statement, appeals to\r\nprejudice, the creation of unkindness, are offenses not against an\r\nindividual or individuals, but offenses against the whole\r\npopulation of the United States. . . .\r\n\r\n\"Self-restraint implies restraint by articulate public opinion,\r\ntrained to distinguish fact from falsehood, trained to believe that\r\nbitterness is never a useful instrument in public affairs.  There\r\ncan be no dictatorship by an individual or by a group in this\r\nNation, save through division fostered by hate.  Such division there\r\nmust never be.\"\r\n\r\nAnd finally I should like to say a personal word to you.\r\n\r\nI never forget that I live in a house owned by all the American\r\npeople and that I have been given their trust.\r\n\r\nI try always to remember that their deepest problems are human.  I\r\nconstantly talk with those who come to tell me their own points of\r\nview; with those who manage the great industries and financial\r\ninstitutions of the country; with those who represent the farmer\r\nand the worker; and often with average citizens without high\r\nposition who come to this house.  And constantly I seek to look\r\nbeyond the doors of the White House, beyond the officialdom of the\r\nnational capital, into the hopes and fears of men and women in\r\ntheir homes.  I have travelled the country over many times.  My\r\nfriends, my enemies, my daily mail bring to me reports of what you\r\nare thinking and hoping.  I want to be sure that neither battles nor\r\nburdens of office shall ever blind me to an intimate knowledge of\r\nthe way the American people want to live and the simple purposes\r\nfor which they put me here.\r\n\r\nIn these great problems of government I try not to forget that what\r\nreally counts at the bottom of it all is that the men and women\r\nwilling to work can have a decent job to take care of themselves\r\nand their homes and their children adequately; that the farmer, the\r\nfactory worker, the storekeeper, the gas station man, the\r\nmanufacturer, the merchant--big and small--the banker who takes\r\npride in the help that he can give to the building of his\r\ncommunity--that all of these can be sure of a reasonable profit and\r\nsafety for the savings they earn--not today nor tomorrow alone, but\r\nas far ahead as they can see.\r\n\r\nI can hear your unspoken wonder as to where we are headed in this\r\ntroubled world.  I cannot expect all of the people to understand all\r\nof the people's problems; but it is my job to try to those\r\nproblems.\r\n\r\nI always try to remember that reconciling differences cannot\r\nsatisfy everyone completely.  Because I do not expect too much, I am\r\nnot disappointed.  But I know that I must never give up--that I must\r\nnever let the greater interest of all the people down, merely\r\nbecause that might be for the moment the easiest personal way out.\r\n\r\nI believe that we have been right in the course we have charted.  To\r\nabandon our purpose of building a greater, a more stable and a more\r\ntolerant America would be to miss the tide and perhaps to miss the\r\nport.  I propose to sail ahead.  I feel sure that your hopes and your\r\nhelp are with me.  For to reach a port, we must sail--sail, not lie\r\nat anchor, sail, not drift.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJune 24, 1938.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur government, happily, is a democracy.  As part of the democratic\r\nprocess, your President is again taking an opportunity to report on\r\nthe progress of national affairs, to report to the real rulers of\r\nthis country--the voting public.\r\n\r\nThe Seventy-Fifth Congress, elected in November, 1936, on a\r\nplatform uncompromisingly liberal, has adjourned.  Barring\r\nunforeseen events, there will be no session until the new Congress,\r\nto be elected in November, assembles next January.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, the Seventy-Fifth Congress has left many things\r\nundone.\r\n\r\nFor example, it refused to provide more businesslike machinery for\r\nrunning the Executive Branch of the government.  The Congress also\r\nfailed to meet my suggestion that it take the far-reaching steps\r\nnecessary to put the railroads of the country back on their feet.\r\n\r\nBut, on the other hand, the Congress, striving to carry out the\r\nplatform on which most of its members were elected, achieved more\r\nfor the future good of the country than any Congress did between\r\nthe end of the World War and the spring of 1933.\r\n\r\nI mention tonight only the more important of these achievements.\r\n\r\n(1) It improved still further our agricultural laws to give the\r\nfarmer a fairer share of the national income, to preserve our soil,\r\nto provide an all-weather granary, to help the farm tenant towards\r\nindependence, to find new uses for farm products, and to begin crop\r\ninsurance.\r\n\r\n(2) After many requests on my part the Congress passed a Fair Labor\r\nStandards Act, commonly called the Wages and Hours Bill.  That act--\r\napplying to products in interstate commerce--ends child labor, sets\r\na floor below wages and a ceiling over hours of labor.\r\n\r\nExcept perhaps for the Social Security Act, it is the most far-\r\nreaching, the most far-sighted program for the benefit of workers\r\never adopted here or in any other country.  Without question it\r\nstarts us toward a better standard of living and increases\r\npurchasing power to buy the products of farm and factory.\r\n\r\nDo not let any calamity-howling executive with an income of $1,000\r\na day, who has been turning his employees over to the government\r\nrelief rolls in order to preserve his company's undistributed\r\nreserves, tell you--using his stockholders' money to pay the\r\npostage for his personal opinions--that a wage of $11 a week is\r\ngoing to have a disastrous effect on all American industry.\r\nFortunately for business as a whole, and therefore for the nation,\r\nthat type of executive is a rarity with whom most business\r\nexecutives most heartily disagree.\r\n\r\n(3) The Congress has provided a fact-finding Commission to find a\r\npath through the jungle of contradictory theories about the wise\r\nbusiness practices--to find the necessary facts for any intelligent\r\nlegislation on monopoly, on price-fixing and on the relationship\r\nbetween big business and medium-sized business and little business.\r\nDifferent from a great part of the world, we in America persist in\r\nour belief in individual enterprise and in the profit motive; but\r\nwe realize we must continually seek improved practices to insure\r\nthe continuance of reasonable profits, together with scientific\r\nprogress, individual initiative, opportunities for the little\r\nfellow, fair prices, decent wages and continuing employment.\r\n\r\n(4) The Congress has coordinated the supervision of commercial\r\naviation and air mail by establishing a new Civil Aeronautics\r\nAuthority; and it has placed all postmasters under the civil\r\nservice for the first time in our national history.\r\n\r\n(5) The Congress set up the United States Housing Authority to help\r\nfinance large-scale slum clearance and provide low rent housing for\r\nthe low income groups in our cities.  And by improving the Federal\r\nHousing Act, the Congress made it easier for private capital to\r\nbuild modest homes and low rental dwellings.\r\n\r\n(6) The Congress has properly reduced taxes on small corporate\r\nenterprises, and has made it easier for the Reconstruction Finance\r\nCorporation to make credit available to all business.  I think the\r\nbankers of the country can fairly be expected to participate in\r\nloans where the government, through the Reconstruction Finance\r\nCorporation, offers to take a fair portion of the risk.\r\n\r\n(7) The Congress has provided additional funds for the Works\r\nProgress Administration, the Public Works Administration, the Rural\r\nElectrification Administration, the Civilian Conservation Corps and\r\nother agencies, in order to take care of what we hope is a\r\ntemporary additional number of unemployed at this time and to\r\nencourage production of every kind by private enterprise.\r\n\r\nAll these things together I call our program for the national\r\ndefense of our economic system.  It is a program of balanced\r\naction--of moving on all fronts at once in intelligent recognition\r\nthat all of our economic problems, of every group, and of every\r\nsection of the country are essentially one problem.\r\n\r\n(8) Finally, because of increasing armaments in other nations and\r\nan international situation which is definitely disturbing to all of\r\nus, the Congress has authorized important additions to the national\r\narmed defense of our shores and our people.\r\n\r\nOn another important subject the net result of a struggle in the\r\nCongress has been an important victory for the people of the United\r\nStates--what might well be called a lost battle which won a war.\r\n\r\nYou will remember that on February 5, 1937, I sent a message to the\r\nCongress dealing with the real need of federal court reforms of\r\nseveral kinds.  In one way or another, during the sessions of this\r\nCongress, the ends--the real objectives--sought in that message,\r\nhave been substantially attained.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the Supreme Court towards constitutional questions\r\nis entirely changed.  Its recent decisions are eloquent testimony of\r\na willingness to collaborate with the two other branches of\r\ngovernment to make democracy work.  The government has been granted\r\nthe right to protect its interests in litigation between private\r\nparties involving the constitutionality of federal, and to appeal\r\ndirectly to the Supreme Court in all cases involving the\r\nconstitutionality of federal statutes; and no single judge is any\r\nlonger empowered to suspend a federal statute on his sole judgment\r\nas to its constitutionality.  Justices of the Supreme Court may now\r\nretire at the age of seventy after ten years of service; a\r\nsubstantial number of additional judgeships have been created in\r\norder to expedite the trial of cases; and finally greater\r\nflexibility has been added to the federal judicial system by\r\nallowing judges to be assigned to congested districts.\r\n\r\nAnother indirect accomplishment of this Congress has been its\r\nresponse to the devotion of the American people to a course of sane\r\nand consistent liberalism.  The Congress has understood that under\r\nmodern conditions government has a continuing responsibility to\r\nmeet continuing problems, and that government cannot take a holiday\r\nof a year, or a month, or even a day just because a few people are\r\ntired or frightened by the inescapable pace, fast pace, of this\r\nmodern world in which we live.\r\n\r\nSome of my opponents and some of my associates have considered that\r\nI have a mistakenly sentimental judgment as to the tenacity of\r\npurpose and the general level of intelligence of the American\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nI am still convinced that the American people, since 1932, continue\r\nto insist on two requisites of private enterprise, and the\r\nrelationship of government to it.  The first is a complete honesty\r\nat the top in looking after the use of other people's money, and in\r\napportioning and paying individual and corporate taxes according to\r\nability to pay.  The second is sincere respect for the need of all\r\npeople who are at the bottom, all people at the bottom who need to\r\nget work--and through work to get a really fair share of the good\r\nthings of life, and a chance to save and rise.\r\n\r\nAfter the election of 1936 I was told, and the Congress was told,\r\nby an increasing number of politically--and worldly--wise people\r\nthat I should coast along, enjoy an easy Presidency for four years,\r\nand not take the Democratic platform too seriously.  They told me\r\nthat people were getting weary of reform through political effort\r\nand would no longer oppose that small minority which, in spite of\r\nits own disastrous leadership in 1929, is always eager to resume\r\nits control over the government of the United States.\r\n\r\nNever in our lifetime has such a concerted campaign of defeatism\r\nbeen thrown at the heads of the President and the Senators and\r\nCongressmen as in the case of this Seventy-Fifth Congress.  Never\r\nbefore have we had so many Copperheads--and you will remember that\r\nit was the Copperheads who, in the days of the War between the\r\nStates, tried their best to make President Lincoln and his Congress\r\ngive up the fight, let the nation remain split in two and return to\r\npeace--peace at any price.\r\n\r\nThis Congress has ended on the side of the people.  My faith in the\r\nAmerican people--and their faith in themselves--have been\r\njustified.  I congratulate the Congress and the leadership thereof\r\nand I congratulate the American people on their own staying power.\r\n\r\nOne word about our economic situation.  It makes no difference to me\r\nwhether you call it a recession or a depression.  In 1932 the total\r\nnational income of all the people in the country had reached the\r\nlow point of thirty-eight billion dollars in that year.  With each\r\nsucceeding year it rose.  Last year, 1937, it had risen to seventy\r\nbillion dollars--despite definitely worse business and agricultural\r\nprices in the last four months of last year.  This year, 1938, while\r\nit is too early to do more than give an estimate, we hope that the\r\nnational income will not fall below sixty billion dollars.  We\r\nremember also that banking and business and farming are not falling\r\napart like the one-hoss shay, as they did in the terrible winter of\r\n1932-1933.\r\n\r\nLast year mistakes were made by the leaders of private enterprise,\r\nby the leaders of labor and by the leaders of government--all\r\nthree.\r\n\r\nLast year the leaders of private enterprise pleaded for a sudden\r\ncurtailment of public spending, and said they would take up the\r\nslack.  But they made the mistake of increasing their inventories\r\ntoo fast and setting many of their prices too high for their goods\r\nto sell.\r\n\r\nSome labor leaders goaded by decades of oppression of labor made\r\nthe mistake of going too far.  They were not wise in using methods\r\nwhich frightened many well-wishing people.  They asked employers not\r\nonly to bargain with them but to put up with jurisdictional\r\ndisputes at the same time.\r\n\r\nGovernment too made mistakes--mistakes of optimism in assuming that\r\nindustry and labor would themselves make no mistakes--and\r\ngovernment made a mistake of timing in not passing a farm bill or a\r\nwage and hour bill last year.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the lessons of all these mistakes we hope that in\r\nthe future private enterprise--capital and labor alike--will\r\noperate more intelligently together, and operate in greater\r\ncooperation with their own government than they have in the past.\r\nSuch cooperation on the part of both of them will be very welcome\r\nto me.  Certainly at this stage there should be a united stand on\r\nthe part of both of them to resist wage cuts which would further\r\nreduce purchasing power.\r\n\r\nToday a great steel company announced a reduction in prices with a\r\nview to stimulating business recovery, and I was gratified to know\r\nthat this reduction involved no wage cut.  Every encouragement ought\r\nto be given to industry which accepts the large volume and high\r\nwage policy.\r\n\r\nIf this is done, it ought to result in conditions which will\r\nreplace a great part of the government spending which the failure\r\nof cooperation has made necessary this year.\r\n\r\nFrom March 4, 1933 down, not a single week has passed without a cry\r\nfrom the opposition, a small opposition, a cry \"to do something, to\r\nsay something, to restore confidence.\"  There is a very articulate\r\ngroup of people in this country, with plenty of ability to procure\r\npublicity for their views, who have consistently refused to\r\ncooperate with the mass of the people, whether things were going\r\nwell or going badly, on the ground that they required more\r\nconcessions to their point of view before they would admit having\r\nwhat they called \"confidence.\"\r\n\r\nThese people demanded \"restoration of confidence\" when the banks\r\nwere closed--and demanded it again when the banks were reopened.\r\n\r\nThey demanded \"restoration of confidence\" when hungry people were\r\nthronging the streets--and again when the hungry people were fed\r\nand put to work.\r\n\r\nThey demanded \"restoration of confidence\" when droughts hit the\r\ncountry--and again now when our fields are laden with bounteous\r\nyields and excessive crops.\r\n\r\nThey demanded \"restoration of confidence\" last year when the\r\nautomobile industry was running three shifts and turning out more\r\ncars than the country could buy--and again this year when the\r\nindustry is trying to get rid of an automobile surplus and has shut\r\ndown its factories as a result.\r\n\r\nIt is my belief that many of these people who have been crying\r\naloud for \"confidence\" are beginning today to realize that that\r\nhand has been overplayed, and that they are now willing to talk\r\ncooperation instead.  It is my belief that the mass of the American\r\npeople do have confidence in themselves--have confidence in their\r\nability, with the aid of government, to solve their own problems.\r\n\r\nIt is because you are not satisfied, and I am not satisfied, with\r\nthe progress that we have made in finally solving our business and\r\nagricultural and social problems that I believe the great majority\r\nof you want your own government to keep on trying to solve them.  In\r\nsimple frankness and in simple honesty, I need all the help I can\r\nget--and I see signs of getting more help in the future from many\r\nwho have fought against progress with tooth and nail.\r\n\r\nAnd now following out this line of thought, I want to say a few\r\nwords about the coming political primaries.\r\n\r\nFifty years ago party nominations were generally made in\r\nconventions--a system typified in the public imagination by a\r\nlittle group in a smoke-filled room who made out the party slates.\r\n\r\nThe direct primary was invented to make the nominating process a\r\nmore democratic one--to give the party voters themselves a chance\r\nto pick their party candidates.\r\n\r\nWhat I am going to say to you tonight does not relate to the\r\nprimaries of any particular political party, but to matters of\r\nprinciple in all parties--Democratic, Republican, Farmer-Labor,\r\nProgressive, Socialist or any other.  Let that be clearly\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\nIt is my hope that everybody affiliated with any party will vote in\r\nthe primaries, and that every such voter will consider the\r\nfundamental principles for which his or her party is on record.\r\nThat makes for a healthy choice between the candidates of the\r\nopposing parties on Election Day in November.\r\n\r\nAn election cannot give the country a firm sense of direction if it\r\nhas two or more national parties which merely have different names\r\nbut are as alike in their principles and aims as peas in the same\r\npod.\r\n\r\nIn the coming primaries in all parties, there will be many clashes\r\nbetween two schools of thought, generally classified as liberal and\r\nconservative.  Roughly speaking, the liberal school of thought\r\nrecognizes that the new conditions throughout the world call for\r\nnew remedies.\r\n\r\nThose of us in America who hold to this school of thought, insist\r\nthat these new remedies can be adopted and successfully maintained\r\nin this country under our present form of government if we use\r\ngovernment as an instrument of cooperation to provide these\r\nremedies.  We believe that we can solve our problems through\r\ncontinuing effort, through democratic processes instead of Fascism\r\nor Communism.  We are opposed to the kind of moratorium on reform\r\nwhich, in effect, is reaction itself.\r\n\r\nBe it clearly understood, however, that when I use the word\r\n\"liberal,\" I mean the believer in progressive principles of\r\ndemocratic, representative government and not the wild man who, in\r\neffect, leans in the direction of Communism, for that is just as\r\ndangerous as Fascism itself.\r\n\r\nThe opposing or conservative school of thought, as a general\r\nproposition, does not recognize the need for government itself to\r\nstep in and take action to meet these new problems.  It believes\r\nthat individual initiative and private philanthropy will solve\r\nthem--that we ought to repeal many of the things we have done and\r\ngo back, for instance, to the old gold standard, or stop all this\r\nbusiness of old age pensions and unemployment insurance, or repeal\r\nthe Securities and Exchange Act, or let monopolies thrive\r\nunchecked--return, in effect, to the kind of government that we had\r\nin the twenties.\r\n\r\nAssuming the mental capacity of all the candidates, the important\r\nquestion which it seems to me the primary voter must ask is this:\r\n\"To which of these general schools of thought does the candidate\r\nbelong?\"\r\n\r\nAs President of the United States, I am not asking the voters of\r\nthe country to vote for Democrats next November as opposed to\r\nRepublicans or members of any other party.  Nor am I, as President,\r\ntaking part in Democratic primaries.\r\n\r\nAs the head of the Democratic Party, however, charged with the\r\nresponsibility of carrying out the definitely liberal declaration\r\nof principles set forth in the 1936 Democratic platform, I feel\r\nthat I have every right to speak in those few instances where there\r\nmay be a clear-cut issue between candidates for a Democratic\r\nnomination involving these principles, or involving a clear misuse\r\nof my own name.\r\n\r\nDo not misunderstand me.  I certainly would not indicate a\r\npreference in a state primary merely because a candidate, otherwise\r\nliberal in outlook, had conscientiously differed with me on any\r\nsingle issue.  I should be far more concerned about the general\r\nattitude of a candidate towards present day problems and his own\r\ninward desire to get practical needs attended to in a practical\r\nway.  We all know that progress may be blocked by outspoken\r\nreactionaries, and also by those who say \"yes\" to a progressive\r\nobjective, but who always find some reason to oppose any special\r\nspecific proposal to gain that objective.  I call that type of\r\ncandidate a \"yes, but\" fellow.\r\n\r\nAnd I am concerned about the attitude of a candidate or his\r\nsponsors with respect to the rights of American citizens to\r\nassemble peaceably and to express publicly their views and opinions\r\non important social and economic issues.  There can be no\r\nconstitutional democracy in any community which denies to the\r\nindividual his freedom to speak and worship as he wishes.  The\r\nAmerican people will not be deceived by anyone who attempts to\r\nsuppress individual liberty under the pretense of patriotism.\r\n\r\nThis being a free country with freedom of expression--especially\r\nwith freedom of the press--there will be a lot of mean blows struck\r\nbetween now and Election Day.  By \"blows\" I mean misrepresentation,\r\npersonal attack and appeals to prejudice.  It would be a lot better,\r\nof course, if campaigns everywhere could be waged with arguments\r\ninstead of with blows.\r\n\r\nI hope the liberal candidates will confine themselves to argument\r\nand not resort to blows.  In nine cases out of ten the speaker or\r\nthe writer who, seeking to influence public opinion, descends from\r\ncalm argument to unfair blows hurts himself more than his opponent.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese have a story on this--a story based on three or four\r\nthousand years of civilization:  Two Chinese coolies were arguing\r\nheatedly in the midst of a crowd.  A stranger expressed surprise\r\nthat no blows were being struck.  His Chinese friend replied:  \"The\r\nman who strikes first admits that his ideas have given out.\"\r\n\r\nI know that neither in the summer primaries nor in the November\r\nelections will the American voters fail to spot the candidate whose\r\nideas have given out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSeptember 3, 1939.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Fellow Americans and My Friends:\r\n\r\n\r\nTonight my single duty is to speak to the whole of America.\r\n\r\nUntil four-thirty this morning I had hoped against hope that some\r\nmiracle would prevent a devastating war in Europe and bring to an\r\nend the invasion of Poland by Germany.\r\n\r\nFor four long years a succession of actual wars and constant crises\r\nhave shaken the entire world and have threatened in each case to\r\nbring on the gigantic conflict which is today unhappily a fact.\r\n\r\nIt is right that I should recall to your minds the consistent and\r\nat time successful efforts of your government in these crises to\r\nthrow the full weight of the United States into the cause of peace.\r\nIn spite of spreading wars I think that we have every right and\r\nevery reason to maintain as a national policy the fundamental\r\nmoralities, the teachings of religion and the continuation of\r\nefforts to restore peace--for some day, though the time may be\r\ndistant, we can be of even greater help to a crippled humanity.\r\n\r\nIt is right, too, to point out that the unfortunate events of these\r\nrecent years have, without question, been based on the use of force\r\nand the threat of force.  And it seems to me clear, even at the\r\noutbreak of this great war, that the influence of America should be\r\nconsistent in seeking for humanity a final peace which will\r\neliminate, as far as it is possible to do so, the continued use of\r\nforce between nations.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, impossible to predict the future.  I have my\r\nconstant stream of information from American representatives and\r\nother sources throughout the world.  You, the people of this\r\ncountry, are receiving news through your radios and your newspapers\r\nat every hour of the day.\r\n\r\nYou are, I believe, the most enlightened and the best informed\r\npeople in all the world at this moment.  You are subjected to no\r\ncensorship of news, and I want to add that your government has no\r\ninformation which it withholds or which it has any thought of\r\nwithholding from you.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, as I told my Press Conference on Friday, it is of\r\nthe highest importance that the press and the radio use the utmost\r\ncaution to discriminate between actual verified fact on the one\r\nhand, and mere rumor on the other.\r\n\r\nI can add to that by saying that I hope the people of this country\r\nwill also discriminate most carefully between news and rumor.  Do\r\nnot believe of necessity everything you hear or read.  Check up on\r\nit first.\r\n\r\nYou must master at the outset a simple but unalterable fact in\r\nmodern foreign relations between nations.  When peace has been\r\nbroken anywhere, the peace of all countries everywhere is in\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\nIt is easy for you and for me to shrug our shoulders and to say\r\nthat conflicts taking place thousands of miles from the continental\r\nUnited States, and, indeed, thousands of miles from the whole\r\nAmerican Hemisphere, do not seriously affect the Americas--and that\r\nall the United States has to do is to ignore them and go about its\r\nown business.  Passionately though we may desire detachment, we are\r\nforced to realize that every word that comes through the air, every\r\nship that sails the sea, every battle that is fought does affect\r\nthe American future.\r\n\r\nLet no man or woman thoughtlessly or falsely talk of America\r\nsending its armies to European fields.  At this moment there is\r\nbeing prepared a proclamation of American neutrality.  This would\r\nhave been done even if there had been no neutrality statute on the\r\nbooks, for this proclamation is in accordance with international\r\nlaw and in accordance with American policy.\r\n\r\nThis will be followed by a Proclamation required by the existing\r\nNeutrality Act.  And I trust that in the days to come our neutrality\r\ncan be made a true neutrality.\r\n\r\nIt is of the utmost importance that the people of this country,\r\nwith the best information in the world, think things through.  The\r\nmost dangerous enemies of American peace are those who, without\r\nwell-rounded information on the whole broad subject of the past,\r\nthe present and the future, undertake to speak with assumed\r\nauthority, to talk in terms of glittering generalities, to give to\r\nthe nation assurances or prophecies which are of little present or\r\nfuture value.\r\n\r\nI myself cannot and do not prophesy the course of events abroad--\r\nand the reason is that because I have of necessity such a complete\r\npicture of what is going on in every part of the world, that I do\r\nnot dare to do so.  And the other reason is that I think it is\r\nhonest for me to be honest with the people of the United States.\r\n\r\nI cannot prophesy the immediate economic effect of this new war on\r\nour nation, but I do say that no American has the moral right to\r\nprofiteer at the expense either of his fellow citizens or of the\r\nmen, the women and the children who are living and dying in the\r\nmidst of war in Europe.\r\n\r\nSome things we do know.  Most of us in the United States believe in\r\nspiritual values.  Most of us, regardless of what church we belong\r\nto, believe in the spirit of the New Testament--a great teaching\r\nwhich opposes itself to the use of force, of armed force, of\r\nmarching armies and falling bombs.  The overwhelming masses of our\r\npeople seek peace--peace at home, and the kind of peace in other\r\nlands which will not jeopardize our peace at home.\r\n\r\nWe have certain ideas and certain ideals of national safety and we\r\nmust act to preserve that safety today and to preserve the safety\r\nof our children in future years.\r\n\r\nThat safety is and will be bound up with the safety of the Western\r\nHemisphere and of the seas adjacent thereto.  We seek to keep war\r\nfrom our own firesides by keeping war from coming to the Americas.\r\nFor that we have historic precedent that goes back to the days of\r\nthe administration of President George Washington.  It is serious\r\nenough and tragic enough to every American family in every state in\r\nthe Union to live in a world that is torn by wars on other\r\ncontinents.  Those wars today affect every American home.  It is our\r\nnational duty to use every effort to keep them out of the Americas.\r\n\r\nAnd at this time let me make the simple plea that partisanship and\r\nselfishness be adjourned; and that national unity be the thought\r\nthat underlies all others.\r\n\r\nThis nation will remain a neutral nation, but I cannot ask that\r\nevery American remain neutral in thought as well.  Even a neutral\r\nhas a right to take account of facts.  Even a neutral cannot be\r\nasked to close his mind or his conscience.\r\n\r\nI have said not once but many times that I have seen war and that I\r\nhate war.  I say that again and again.\r\n\r\nI hope the United States will keep out of this war.  I believe that\r\nit will.  And I give you assurance and reassurance that every effort\r\nof your government will be directed toward that end.\r\n\r\nAs long as it remains within my power to prevent, there will be no\r\nblackout of peace in the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMay 26, 1940.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Friends:\r\n\r\nAt this moment of sadness throughout most of the world, I want to\r\ntalk with you about a number of subjects that directly affect the\r\nfuture of the United States.  We are shocked by the almost\r\nincredible eyewitness stories that come to us, stories of what is\r\nhappening at this moment to the civilian populations of Norway and\r\nHolland and Belgium and Luxembourg and France.\r\n\r\nI think it is right on this Sabbath evening that I should say a\r\nword in behalf of women and children and old men who need help--\r\nimmediate help in their present distress--help from us across the\r\nseas, help from us who are still free to give it.\r\n\r\nTonight over the once peaceful roads of Belgium and France millions\r\nare now moving, running from their homes to escape bombs and shells\r\nand fire and machine gunning, without shelter, and almost wholly\r\nwithout food.  They stumble on, knowing not where the end of the\r\nroad will be.  I speak to you of these people because each one of\r\nyou that is listening to me tonight has a way of helping them.  The\r\nAmerican Red Cross, that represents each of us, is rushing food and\r\nclothing and medical supplies to these destitute civilian millions.\r\nPlease--I beg you--please give according to your means to your\r\nnearest Red Cross chapter, give as generously as you can.  I ask\r\nthis in the name of our common humanity.\r\n\r\nLet us sit down together again, you and I, to consider our own\r\npressing problems that confront us.\r\n\r\nThere are many among us who in the past closed their eyes to events\r\nabroad--because they believed in utter good faith what some of\r\ntheir fellow Americans told them--that what was taking place in\r\nEurope was none of our business; that no matter what happened over\r\nthere, the United States could always pursue its peaceful and\r\nunique course in the world.\r\n\r\nThere are many among us who closed their eyes, from lack of\r\ninterest or lack of knowledge; honestly and sincerely thinking that\r\nthe many hundreds of miles of salt water made the American\r\nHemisphere so remote that the people of North and Central and South\r\nAmerica could go on living in the midst of their vast resources\r\nwithout reference to, or danger from, other Continents of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThere are some among us who were persuaded by minority groups that\r\nwe could maintain our physical safety by retiring within our\r\ncontinental boundaries--the Atlantic on the east, the Pacific on\r\nthe west, Canada on the north and Mexico on the south.  I\r\nillustrated the futility--the impossibility--of that idea in my\r\nmessage to the Congress last week.  Obviously, a defense policy\r\nbased on that is merely to invite future attack.\r\n\r\nAnd, finally, there are a few among us who have deliberately and\r\nconsciously closed their eyes because they were determined to be\r\nopposed to their government, its foreign policy and every other\r\npolicy, to be partisan, and to believe that anything that the\r\ngovernment did was wholly wrong.\r\n\r\nTo those who have closed their eyes for any of these many reasons,\r\nto those who would not admit the possibility of the approaching\r\nstorm--to all of them the past two weeks have meant the shattering\r\nof many illusions.\r\n\r\nThey have lost the illusion that we are remote and isolated and,\r\ntherefore, secure against the dangers from which no other land is\r\nfree.\r\n\r\nIn some quarters, with this rude awakening has come fear, fear\r\nbordering on panic.  It is said that we are defenseless.  It is\r\nwhispered by some that, only by abandoning our freedom, our ideals,\r\nour way of life, can we build our defenses adequately, can we match\r\nthe strength of the aggressors.\r\n\r\nI did not share those illusions.  I do not share these fears.\r\n\r\nToday we are now more realistic.  But let us not be calamity-howlers\r\nand discount our strength.  Let us have done with both fears and\r\nillusions.  On this Sabbath evening, in our homes in the midst of\r\nour American families, let us calmly consider what we have done and\r\nwhat we must do.\r\n\r\nIn the past two or three weeks all kinds of stories have been\r\nhanded out to the American public about our lack of preparedness.\r\nIt has even been charged that the money we have spent on our\r\nmilitary and naval forces during the last few years has gone down\r\nthe rat-hole.  I think that it is a matter of fairness to the nation\r\nthat you hear the facts.\r\n\r\nYes, we have spent large sums of money on the national defense.\r\nThis money has been used to make our Army and Navy today the\r\nlargest, the best equipped, and the best trained peace-time\r\nmilitary establishment in the whole history of this country.\r\n\r\nLet me tell you just a few of the many things accomplished during\r\nthe past few years.\r\n\r\nI do not propose to go into every detail.  It is a known fact,\r\nhowever, that in 1933, when this administration came into office,\r\nthe United States Navy had fallen in standing among the navies of\r\nthe world, in power of ships and in efficiency, to a relatively low\r\nebb.  The relative fighting power on the Navy had been greatly\r\ndiminished by failure to replace ships and equipment, which had\r\nbecome out-of-date.\r\n\r\nBut between 1933 and this year, 1940--seven fiscal years--your\r\ngovernment will have spent one billion, four hundred eighty-seven\r\nmillion dollars more than it spent on the Navy during the seven\r\nyears that preceded 1933.\r\n\r\nWhat did we get for this money?\r\n\r\nThe fighting personnel of the Navy rose from 79,000 to 145,000.\r\n\r\nDuring this period 215 ships for the fighting fleet have been laid\r\ndown or commissioned, practically seven times the number in the\r\npreceding seven-year period.\r\n\r\nOf these 215 ships we have commissioned: 12 cruisers; 63\r\ndestroyers; 26 submarines; 3 aircraft carriers; 2 gunboats; 7\r\nauxiliaries and many smaller craft.  And among the many ships now\r\nbeing built and paid for as we build them are 8 new battleships.\r\n\r\nShip construction, of course, costs millions of dollars--more in\r\nthe United States than anywhere else in the world; but it is a fact\r\nthat we cannot have adequate navy defense for all American waters\r\nwithout ships--ships that sail the surface of the ocean, ships that\r\nmove under the surface and ships that move through the air.  And,\r\nspeaking of airplanes that work with the Navy, in 1933 we had 1,127\r\nuseful aircraft and today we have 2,892 on hand and on order.\r\nNearly all of the old planes of 1933 have been replaced by new\r\nplanes because they became obsolete or worn out.\r\n\r\nThe Navy Is far stronger today than at any peace-time period in the\r\nwhole long history of the nation.  In hitting power and in\r\nefficiency, I would even make the assertion that it is stronger\r\ntoday than it was during the World War.\r\n\r\nThe Army of the United States:  In 1933 it consisted of 122,000\r\nenlisted men.  Now, in 1940, that number has been practically\r\ndoubled.  The Army of 1933 had been given few new implements of war\r\nsince 1919, and had been compelled to draw on old reserve stocks\r\nleft over from the World War.\r\n\r\nThe net result of all this was that our Army by l933 had very\r\ngreatly declined in its ratio of strength with the armies of Europe\r\nand of the Far East.\r\n\r\nThat was the situation I found.\r\n\r\nBut, since then, great changes have taken place.\r\n\r\nBetween 1933 and 1940--these past seven fiscal years--your\r\ngovernment will have spent $1,292,000,000 more than it spent on the\r\nArmy the previous seven years.\r\n\r\nWhat did we get for this money?\r\n\r\nThe personnel of the Army, as I have said, has been almost doubled.\r\nAnd by the end of this year every existing unit of the present\r\nregular Army will be equipped with its complete requirements of\r\nmodern weapons.  Existing units of the national Guard will also be\r\nlargely equipped with similar items.\r\n\r\nHere are some striking examples taken from a large number:\r\n\r\nSince 1933 we have actually purchased 5,640 airplanes, including\r\nthe most modern type of long-range bombers and fast pursuit planes,\r\nthough, of course, many of these which were delivered four, five,\r\nsix or seven years ago have worn out through use and been scrapped.\r\n\r\nWe must remember that these planes cost money--a lot of it.  For\r\nexample, one modern four-engine long-range bombing plane costs\r\n$350,000; one modern interceptor pursuit plane costs $133,000; one\r\nmedium bomber costs $160,000.\r\n\r\nIn 1933 we had only 355 anti-aircraft guns.  We now have more than\r\n1,700 modern anti-craft guns of all types on hand or on order.  And\r\nyou ought to know that a three-inch anti-aircraft gun costs $40,000\r\nwithout any of the fire control equipment that goes with it.\r\n\r\nIn 1933 there were only 24 modern infantry mortars in the entire\r\nArmy.  We now have on hand and on order more than 1,600.\r\n\r\nIn 1933 we had only 48 modern tanks and armored cars; today we have\r\non hand and on order 1,700.  Each one of our heavier tanks costs\r\n$46,000.\r\n\r\nThere are many other items in which our progress since 1933 has\r\nbeen rapid.  And the great proportion of this advance consists of\r\nreally modern equipment.\r\n\r\nIn 1933, on the personnel side we had 1,263 Army pilots.  Today the\r\nArmy alone has more than 3,000 of the best fighting flyers in the\r\nworld, flyers who last year flew more than one million hours in\r\ncombat training.  That figure does not include the hundreds of\r\nsplendid pilots in the national Guard and in the organized\r\nreserves.\r\n\r\nWithin the past year the productive capacity of the aviation\r\nindustry to produce military planes has been tremendously\r\nincreased.  In the past year the capacity more than doubled, but\r\nthat capacity is still inadequate.  However, the government, working\r\nwith industry, is determined to increase that capacity to meet our\r\nneeds.  We intend to harness the efficient machinery of these\r\nmanufacturers to the government's program of being able to get\r\n50,000 planes a year.\r\n\r\nOne additional word about aircraft, about which we read so much.\r\nRecent wars, including the current war in Europe, have demonstrated\r\nbeyond doubt that fighting efficiency depends on unity of command,\r\nunity of control.\r\n\r\nIn sea operations the airplane is just as much an integral part of\r\nthe unity of operations as are the submarine, the destroyer and the\r\nbattleship, and in land warfare the airplane is just as much a part\r\nof military operations as are the tank corps, the engineers, the\r\nartillery or the infantry itself.  Therefore, the air forces should\r\ncontinue to be part of the Army and Navy.\r\n\r\nIn line with my request the Congress, this week, is voting the\r\nlargest appropriation ever asked by the Army or the Navy in\r\npeacetime, and the equipment and training provided for them will be\r\nin addition to the figures I have given you.\r\n\r\nThe world situation may so change that it will be necessary to\r\nreappraise our program at any time.  And in such case I am confident\r\nthat the Congress and the Chief Executive will work in harmony as a\r\nteam as they are doing today.\r\n\r\nI will not hesitate at any moment to ask for additional funds when\r\nthey are required.\r\n\r\nIn this era of swift, mechanized warfare, we all have to remember\r\nthat what is modern today and up-to-date, what is efficient and\r\npractical, becomes obsolete and outworn tomorrow.\r\n\r\nEven while the production line turns out airplanes, new airplanes\r\nare being designed on the drafting table.\r\n\r\nEven as a cruiser slides down the launching ways, plans for\r\nimprovement, plans for increased efficiency in the next model, are\r\ntaking shape in the blueprints of designers.\r\n\r\nEvery day's fighting in Europe, on land, on sea, and in the air,\r\ndiscloses constant changes in methods of warfare.  We are constantly\r\nimproving and redesigning, testing new weapons, learning the\r\nlessons of the immediate war, and seeking to produce in accordance\r\nwith the latest that the brains of science can conceive.\r\n\r\nWe are calling upon the resources, the efficiency and the ingenuity\r\nof the American manufacturers of war material of all kinds--\r\nairplanes and tanks and guns and ships, and all the hundreds of\r\nproducts that go into this material.  The government of the United\r\nStates itself manufactures few of the implements of war.  Private\r\nindustry will continue to be the source of most of this materiel,\r\nand private industry will have to be speeded up to produce it at\r\nthe rate and efficiency called for by the needs of the times.\r\n\r\nI know that private business cannot be expected to make all of the\r\ncapital investment required for expansions of plants and factories\r\nand personnel which this program calls for at once.  It would be\r\nunfair to expect industrial corporations or their investors to do\r\nthis, when there is a chance that a change in international affairs\r\nmay stop or curtail future orders a year or two hence.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the government of the United States stands ready to\r\nadvance the necessary money to help provide for the enlargement of\r\nfactories, the establishment of new plants, the employment of\r\nthousands of necessary workers, the development of new sources of\r\nsupply for the hundreds of raw materials required, the development\r\nof quick mass transportation of supplies.  And the details of all of\r\nthis are now being worked out in Washington, day and night.\r\n\r\nWe are calling on men now engaged in private industry to help us in\r\ncarrying out this program and you will hear more of this in detail\r\nin the next few days.\r\n\r\nThis does not mean that the men we call upon will be engaged in the\r\nactual production of this materiel.  That will still have to be\r\ncarried on in the plants and factories throughout the land.  Private\r\nindustry will have the responsibility of providing the best,\r\nspeediest and most efficient mass production of which it is\r\ncapable.  The functions of the businessmen whose assistance we are\r\ncalling upon will be to coordinate this program--to see to it that\r\nall of the plants continue to operate at maximum speed and\r\nefficiency.\r\n\r\nPatriotic Americans of proven merit and of unquestioned ability in\r\ntheir special fields are coming to Washington to help the\r\ngovernment with their training, their experience and their\r\ncapability.\r\n\r\nIt is our purpose not only to speed up production but to increase\r\nthe total facilities of the nation in such a way that they can be\r\nfurther enlarged to meet emergencies of the future.\r\n\r\nBut as this program proceeds there are several things we must\r\ncontinue to watch and safeguard, things which are just as important\r\nto the sound defense of a nation as physical armament itself.  While\r\nour Navy and our airplanes and our guns and our ships may be our\r\nfirst line of defense, it is still clear that way down at the\r\nbottom, underlying them all, giving them their strength, sustenance\r\nand power, are the spirit and morale of a free people.\r\n\r\nFor that reason, we must make sure, in all that we do, that there\r\nbe no breakdown or cancellation of any of the great social gains\r\nwhich we have made in these past years.  We have carried on an\r\noffensive on a broad front against social and economic inequalities\r\nand abuses which had made our society weak.  That offensive should\r\nnot now be broken down by the pincers movement of those who would\r\nuse the present needs of physical military defense to destroy it.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing in our present emergency to justify making the\r\nworkers of our nation toil for longer hours than now limited by\r\nstatute.  As more orders come in and as more work has to be done,\r\ntens of thousands of people, who are now unemployed, will, I\r\nbelieve, receive employment.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing in our present emergency to justify a lowering of\r\nthe standards of employment.  Minimum wages should not be reduced.\r\nIt is my hope, indeed, that the new speed-up of production will\r\ncause many businesses which now pay below the minimum standards to\r\nbring their wages up.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing in our present emergency to justify a breaking\r\ndown of old age pensions or of unemployment insurance.  I would\r\nrather see the systems extended to other groups who do not now\r\nenjoy them.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing in our present emergency to justify a retreat from\r\nany of our social objectives--from conservation of natural\r\nresources, assistance to agriculture, housing, and help to the\r\nunderprivileged.\r\n\r\nConversely, however, I am sure that responsible leaders will not\r\npermit some specialized group, which represents a minority of the\r\ntotal employees of a plant or an industry, to break up the\r\ncontinuity of employment of the majority of the employees.  Let us\r\nremember that the policy and the laws that provide for collective\r\nbargaining are still in force.  I can assure you that labor will be\r\nadequately represented in Washington in the carrying out of this\r\nprogram of defense.\r\n\r\nAlso, our present emergency and a common sense of decency make it\r\nimperative that no new group of war millionaires shall come into\r\nbeing in this nation as a result of the struggles abroad.  The\r\nAmerican people will not relish the idea of any American citizen\r\ngrowing rich and fat in an emergency of blood and slaughter and\r\nhuman suffering.\r\n\r\nAnd, last of all, this emergency demands that the consumers of\r\nAmerica be protected so that our general cost of living can be\r\nmaintained at a reasonable level.  We ought to avoid the spiral\r\nprocesses of the World War, the rising spiral of costs of all\r\nkinds.  The soundest policy is for every employer in the country to\r\nhelp give useful employment to the millions who are unemployed.  By\r\ngiving to those millions an increased purchasing power, the\r\nprosperity of the whole nation will rise to a much higher level.\r\n\r\nToday's threat to our national security is not a matter of military\r\nweapons alone.  We know of new methods of attack.\r\n\r\nThe Trojan Horse.  The Fifth Column that betrays a nation unprepared\r\nfor treachery.\r\n\r\nSpies, saboteurs and traitors are the actors in this new strategy.\r\nWith all of these we must and will deal vigorously.\r\n\r\nBut there is an added technique for weakening a nation at its very\r\nroots, for disrupting the entire pattern of life of a people.  And\r\nit is important that we understand it.\r\n\r\nThe method is simple.  It is, first, a dissemination of discord.  A\r\ngroup--not too large--a group that may be sectional or racial or\r\npolitical--is encouraged to exploit its prejudices through false\r\nslogans and emotional appeals.  The aim of those who deliberately\r\negg on these groups is to create confusion of counsel, public\r\nindecision, political paralysis and eventually, a state of panic.\r\n\r\nSound national policies come to be viewed with a new and\r\nunreasoning skepticism, not through the wholesome political debates\r\nof honest and free men, but through the clever schemes of foreign\r\nagents.\r\n\r\nAs a result of these new techniques, armament programs may be\r\ndangerously delayed.  Singleness of national purpose may be\r\nundermined.  Men can lose confidence in each other, and therefore\r\nlose confidence in the efficacy of their own united action.  Faith\r\nand courage can yield to doubt and fear.  The unity of the State can\r\nbe so sapped that its strength is destroyed.\r\n\r\nAll this is no idle dream.  It has happened time after time, in\r\nnation after nation, during the last two years.  Fortunately,\r\nAmerican men and women are not easy dupes.  Campaigns of group\r\nhatred or class struggle have never made much headway among us, and\r\nare not making headway now.  But new forces are being unleashed,\r\ndeliberately planned propaganda to divide and weaken us in the face\r\nof danger as other nations have been weakened before.\r\n\r\nThese dividing forces are undiluted poison.  They must not be\r\nallowed to spread in the New World as they have in the Old.  Our\r\nmorale and our mental defenses must be raised up as never before\r\nagainst those who would cast a smokescreen across our vision.\r\n\r\nThe development of our defense program makes it essential that each\r\nand every one of us, men and women, feel that we have some\r\ncontribution to make toward the security of our nation.\r\n\r\nAt this time, when the world--and the world includes our own\r\nAmerican Hemisphere--when the world is threatened by forces of\r\ndestruction, it is my resolve and yours to build up our armed\r\ndefenses.\r\n\r\nWe shall build them to whatever heights the future may require.\r\n\r\nWe shall rebuild them swiftly, as the methods of warfare swiftly\r\nchange.\r\n\r\nFor more than three centuries we Americans have been building on\r\nthis continent a free society, a society in which the promise of\r\nthe human spirit may find fulfillment.  Commingled here are the\r\nblood and genius of all the peoples of the world who have sought\r\nthis promise.\r\n\r\nWe have built well.  We are continuing our efforts to bring the\r\nblessings of a free society, of a free and productive economic\r\nsystem, to every family in the land.  This is the promise of\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nIt is this that we must continue to build--this that we must\r\ncontinue to defend.\r\n\r\nIt is the task of our generation, yours and mine.  But we build and\r\ndefend not for our generation alone.  We defend the foundations laid\r\ndown by our fathers.  We build a life for generations yet unborn.  We\r\ndefend and we build a way of life, not for America alone, but for\r\nall mankind.  Ours is a high duty, a noble task.\r\n\r\nDay and night I pray for the restoration of peace in this mad world\r\nof ours.  It is not necessary that I, the President, ask the\r\nAmerican people to pray in behalf of such a cause--for I know you\r\nare praying with me.\r\n\r\nI am certain that out of the hearts of every man, woman and child\r\nin this land, in every waking minute, a supplication goes up to\r\nAlmighty God; that all of us beg that suffering and starving, that\r\ndeath and destruction may end--and that peace may return to the\r\nworld.  In common affection for all mankind, your prayers join with\r\nmine--that God will heal the wounds and the hearts of humanity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSeptember 11, 1941.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Fellow Americans:\r\n\r\nThe Navy Department of the United States has reported to me that on\r\nthe morning of September fourth the United States destroyer GREER,\r\nproceeding in full daylight towards Iceland, had reached a point\r\nsoutheast of Greenland.  She was carrying American mail to Iceland.\r\nShe was flying the American flag.  Her identity as an American ship\r\nwas unmistakable.\r\n\r\nShe was then and there attacked by a submarine.  Germany admits that\r\nit was a German submarine.  The submarine deliberately fired a\r\ntorpedo at the GREER, followed later by another torpedo attack.  In\r\nspite of what Hitler's propaganda bureau has invented, and in spite\r\nof what any American obstructionist organization may prefer to\r\nbelieve, I tell you the blunt fact that the German submarine fired\r\nfirst upon this American destroyer without warning, and with\r\ndeliberate design to sink her.\r\n\r\nOur destroyer, at the time, was in waters which the government of\r\nthe United States had declared to be waters of self-defense--\r\nsurrounding outposts of American protection in the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nIn the North of the Atlantic, outposts have been established by us\r\nin Iceland, in Greenland, in Labrador and in Newfoundland.  Through\r\nthese waters there pass many ships of many flags.  They bear food\r\nand other supplies to civilians; and they bear material of war, for\r\nwhich the people of the United States are spending billions of\r\ndollars, and which, by Congressional action, they have declared to\r\nbe essential for the defense of our own land.\r\n\r\nThe United States destroyer, when attacked, was proceeding on a\r\nlegitimate mission.\r\n\r\nIf the destroyer was visible to the submarine when the torpedo was\r\nfired, then the attack was a deliberate attempt by the Nazis to\r\nsink a clearly identified American warship.  On the other hand, if\r\nthe submarine was beneath the surface of the sea and, with the aid\r\nof its listening devices, fired in the direction of the sound of\r\nthe American destroyer without even taking the trouble to learn its\r\nidentity--as the official German communique would indicate--then\r\nthe attack was even more outrageous.  For it indicates a policy of\r\nindiscriminate violence against any vessel sailing the seas--\r\nbelligerent or non-belligerent.\r\n\r\nThis was piracy--piracy legally and morally.  It was not the first\r\nnor the last act of piracy which the Nazi government has committed\r\nagainst the American flag in this war.  For attack has followed\r\nattack.\r\n\r\nA few months ago an American flag merchant ship, the ROBIN MOOR,\r\nwas sunk by a Nazi submarine in the middle of the South Atlantic,\r\nunder circumstances violating long-established international law\r\nand violating every principle of humanity.  The passengers and the\r\ncrew were forced into open boats hundreds of miles from land, in\r\ndirect violation of international agreements signed by nearly all\r\nnations including the government of Germany.  No apology, no\r\nallegation of mistake, no offer of reparations has come from the\r\nNazi government.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1941, nearly two months ago an American battleship in\r\nNorth American waters was followed by a submarine which for a long\r\ntime sought to maneuver itself into a position of attack upon the\r\nbattleship.  The periscope of the submarine was clearly seen.  No\r\nBritish or American submarines were within hundreds of miles of\r\nthis spot at the time, so the nationality of the submarine is\r\nclear.\r\n\r\nFive days ago a United States Navy ship on patrol picked up three\r\nsurvivors of an American-owned ship operating under the flag of our\r\nsister Republic of Panama--the S. S.  SESSA.  On August seventeenth,\r\nshe had been first torpedoed without warning, and then shelled,\r\nnear Greenland, while carrying civilian supplies to Iceland.  It is\r\nfeared that the other members of her crew have been drowned.  In\r\nview of the established presence of German submarines in this\r\nvicinity, there can be no reasonable doubt as to the identity of\r\nthe flag of the attacker.\r\n\r\nFive days ago, another United states merchant ship, the STEEL\r\nSEAFARER, was sunk by a German aircraft in the Red Sea two hundred\r\nand twenty miles south of Suez.  She was bound for an Egyptian port.\r\n\r\nSo four of the vessels sunk or attacked flew the American flag and\r\nwere clearly identifiable.  Two of these ships were warships of the\r\nAmerican Navy.  In the fifth case, the vessel sunk clearly carried\r\nthe flag of our sister Republic of Panama.\r\n\r\nIn the face of all this, we Americans are keeping our feet on the\r\nground.  Our type of democratic civilization has outgrown the\r\nthought of feeling compelled to fight some other nation by reason\r\nof any single piratical attack on one of our ships.  We are not\r\nbecoming hysterical or losing our sense of proportion.  Therefore,\r\nwhat I am thinking and saying tonight does not relate to any\r\nisolated episode.\r\n\r\nInstead, we Americans are taking a long-range point of view in\r\nregard certain fundamentals and to a series of events on land and\r\non sea which must be considered as a whole--as a part of a world\r\npattern.\r\n\r\nIt would be unworthy of a great nation to exaggerate an isolated\r\nincident, or to become inflamed by some one act of violence.  But it\r\nwould be inexcusable folly to minimize such incidents in the face\r\nof evidence which makes it clear that the incident is not isolated,\r\nbut is part of a general plan.\r\n\r\nThe important truth is that these acts of international lawlessness\r\nare a manifestation of a design which has been made clear to the\r\nAmerican people for a long time.  It is the Nazi design to abolish\r\nthe freedom of the seas, and to acquire absolute control and\r\ndomination of these seas for themselves.\r\n\r\nFor with control of the seas in their own hands, the way can\r\nobviously become clear for their next step--domination of the\r\nUnited States--domination of the Western Hemisphere by force of\r\narms.  Under Nazi control of the seas, no merchant ship of the\r\nUnited States or of any other American Republic would be free to\r\ncarry on any peaceful commerce, except by the condescending grace\r\nof this foreign and tyrannical power.  The Atlantic Ocean which has\r\nbeen, and which should always be, a free and friendly highway for\r\nus would then become a deadly menace to the commerce of the United\r\nStates, to the coasts of the United States, and even to the inland\r\ncities of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe Hitler government, in defiance of the laws of the sea, in\r\ndefiance of the recognized rights of all other nations, has\r\npresumed to declare, on paper, that great areas of the seas--even\r\nincluding a vast expanse lying in the Western Hemisphere--are to be\r\nclosed, and that no ships may enter them for any purpose, except at\r\nperil of being sunk.  Actually they are sinking ships at will and\r\nwithout warning in widely separated areas both within and far\r\noutside of these far-flung pretended zones.\r\n\r\nThis Nazi attempt to seize control of the oceans is but a\r\ncounterpart of the Nazi plots now being carried on throughout the\r\nWestern Hemisphere--all designed toward the same end.  For Hitler's\r\nadvance guards--not only his avowed agents but also his dupes among\r\nus--have sought to make ready for him footholds, and bridgeheads in\r\nthe New World, to be used as soon as he has gained control of the\r\noceans.\r\n\r\nHis intrigues, his plots, his machinations, his sabotage in this\r\nNew World are all known to the government of the United States.\r\nConspiracy has followed conspiracy.\r\n\r\nFor example, last year a plot to seize the government of Uruguay\r\nwas smashed by the prompt action of that country, which was\r\nsupported in full by her American neighbors.  A like plot was then\r\nhatching in Argentina, and that government has carefully and wisely\r\nblocked it at every point.  More recently, an endeavor was made to\r\nsubvert the government of Bolivia.  And within the past few weeks\r\nthe discovery was made of secret air-landing fields in Colombia,\r\nwithin easy range of the Panama Canal.  I could multiply instance\r\nupon instance.\r\n\r\nTo be ultimately successful in world mastery, Hitler knows that he\r\nmust get control of the seas.  He must first destroy the bridge of\r\nships which we are building across the Atlantic and over which we\r\nshall continue to roll the implements of war to help destroy him,\r\nto destroy all his works in the end.  He must wipe out our patrol on\r\nsea and in the air if he is to do it.  He must silence the British\r\nNavy.\r\n\r\nI think it must be explained over and over again to people who like\r\nto think of the United States Navy as an invincible protection,\r\nthat this can be true only if the British Navy survives.  And that,\r\nmy friends, is simple arithmetic.\r\n\r\nFor if the world outside of the Americas falls under Axis\r\ndomination, the shipbuilding facilities which the Axis powers would\r\nthen possess in all of Europe, in the British Isles and in the Far\r\nEast would be much greater than all the shipbuilding facilities and\r\npotentialities of all of the Americas--not only greater, but two or\r\nthree times greater--enough to win.  Even if the United States threw\r\nall its resources into such a situation, seeking to double and even\r\nredouble the size of our Navy, the Axis powers, in control of the\r\nrest of the world, would have the manpower and the physical\r\nresources to outbuild us several times over.\r\n\r\nIt is time for all Americans, Americans of all the Americas to stop\r\nbeing deluded by the romantic notion that the Americas can go on\r\nliving happily and peacefully in a Nazi-dominated world.\r\n\r\nGeneration after generation, America has battled for the general\r\npolicy of the freedom of the seas.  And that policy is a very simple\r\none--but a basic, a fundamental one.  It means that no nation has\r\nthe right to make the broad oceans of the world at great distances\r\nfrom the actual theatre of land war, unsafe for the commerce of\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThat has been our policy, proved time and time again, in all of our\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nOur policy has applied from the earliest days of the Republic--and\r\nstill applies--not merely to the Atlantic but to the Pacific and to\r\nall other oceans as well.\r\n\r\nUnrestricted submarine warfare in 1941 constitutes a defiance--an\r\nact of aggression--against that historic American policy.\r\n\r\nIt is now clear that Hitler has begun his campaign to control the\r\nseas by ruthless force and by wiping out every vestige of\r\ninternational law, every vestige of humanity.\r\n\r\nHis intention has been made clear.  The American people can have no\r\nfurther illusions about it.\r\n\r\nNo tender whisperings of appeasers that Hitler is not interested in\r\nthe Western Hemisphere, no soporific lullabies that a wide ocean\r\nprotects us from him--can long have any effect on the hard-headed,\r\nfar-sighted and realistic American people.\r\n\r\nBecause of these episodes, because of the movements and operations\r\nof German warships, and because of the clear, repeated proof that\r\nthe present government of Germany has no respect for treaties or\r\nfor international law, that it has no decent attitude toward\r\nneutral nations or human life--we Americans are now face to face\r\nnot with abstract theories but with cruel, relentless facts.\r\n\r\nThis attack on the GREER was no localized military operation in the\r\nNorth Atlantic.  This was no mere episode in a struggle between two\r\nnations.  This was one determined step towards creating a permanent\r\nworld system based on force, on terror and on murder.\r\n\r\nAnd I am sure that even now the Nazis are waiting to see whether\r\nthe United States will by silence give them the green light to go\r\nahead on this path of destruction.\r\n\r\nThe Nazi danger to our Western world has long ceased to be a mere\r\npossibility.  The danger is here now--not only from a military enemy\r\nbut from an enemy of all law, all liberty, all morality, all\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\nThere has now come a time when you and I must see the cold\r\ninexorable necessity of saying to these inhuman, unrestrained\r\nseekers of world conquest and permanent world domination by the\r\nsword:  \"You seek to throw our children and our children's children\r\ninto your form of terrorism and slavery.  You have now attacked our\r\nown safety.  You shall go no further.\"\r\n\r\nNormal practices of diplomacy--note writing--are of no possible use\r\nin dealing with international outlaws who sink our ships and kill\r\nour citizens.\r\n\r\nOne peaceful nation after another has met disaster because each\r\nrefused to look the Nazi danger squarely in the eye until it had\r\nactually had them by the throat.\r\n\r\nThe United States will not make that fatal mistake.\r\n\r\nNo act of violence, no act of intimidation will keep us from\r\nmaintaining intact two bulwarks of American defense:  First, our\r\nline of supply of material to the enemies of Hitler; and second,\r\nthe freedom of our shipping on the high seas.\r\n\r\nNo matter what it takes, no matter what it costs, we will keep open\r\nthe line of legitimate commerce in these defensive water.\r\n\r\nWe have sought no shooting war with Hitler.  We do not seek it now.\r\nBut neither do we want peace so much, that we are willing to pay\r\nfor it by permitting him to attack our naval and merchant ships\r\nwhile they are on legitimate business.\r\n\r\nI assume that the German leaders are not deeply concerned, tonight\r\nor any other time, by what we Americans or the American government\r\nsay or publish about them.  We cannot bring about the downfall of\r\nNazism by the use of long-range invective.\r\n\r\nBut when you see a rattlesnake poised to strike, you do not wait\r\nuntil he has struck before you crush him.\r\n\r\nThese Nazi submarines and raiders are the rattlesnakes of the\r\nAtlantic.  They are a menace to the free pathways of the high seas.\r\nThey are a challenge to our own sovereignty.  They hammer at our\r\nmost precious rights when they attack ships of the American flag--\r\nsymbols of our independence, our freedom, our very life.\r\n\r\nIt is clear to all Americans that the time has come when the\r\nAmericas themselves must now be defended.  A continuation of attacks\r\nin our own waters or in waters that could be used for further and\r\ngreater attacks on us, will inevitably weaken our American ability\r\nto repel Hitlerism.\r\n\r\nDo not let us be hair-splitters.  Let us not ask ourselves whether\r\nthe Americas should begin to defend themselves after the first\r\nattack, or the fifth attack, or the tenth attack, or the twentieth\r\nattack.\r\n\r\nThe time for active defense is now.\r\n\r\nDo not let us split hairs.  Let us not say:  \"We will only defend\r\nourselves if the torpedo succeeds in getting home, or if the crew\r\nand the passengers are drowned\".\r\n\r\nThis is the time for prevention of attack.\r\n\r\nIf submarines or raiders attack in distant waters, they can attack\r\nequally well within sight of our own shores.  Their very presence in\r\nany waters which America deems vital to its defense constitutes an\r\nattack.\r\n\r\nIn the waters which we deem necessary for our defense, American\r\nnaval vessels and American planes will no longer wait until Axis\r\nsubmarines lurking under the water, or Axis raiders on the surface\r\nof the sea, strike their deadly blow--first.\r\n\r\nUpon our naval and air patrol--now operating in large number over a\r\nvast expanse of the Atlantic Ocean--falls the duty of maintaining\r\nthe American policy of freedom of the seas--now.  That means, very\r\nsimply, very clearly, that our patrolling vessels and planes will\r\nprotect all merchant ships--not only American ships but ships of\r\nany flag--engaged in commerce in our defensive waters.  They will\r\nprotect them from submarines; they will protect them from surface\r\nraiders.\r\n\r\nThis situation is not new.  The second President of the United\r\nStates, John Adams, ordered the United States Navy to clean out\r\nEuropean privateers and European ships of war which were infesting\r\nthe Caribbean and South American waters, destroying American\r\ncommerce.\r\n\r\nThe third President of the United States, Thomas Jefferson, ordered\r\nthe United States Navy to end the attacks being made upon American\r\nand other ships by the corsairs of the nations of North Africa.\r\n\r\nMy obligation as President is historic; it is clear.  It is\r\ninescapable.\r\n\r\nIt is no act of war on our part when we decide to protect the seas\r\nthat are vital to American defense.  The aggression is not ours.\r\nOurs is solely defense.\r\n\r\nBut let this warning be clear.  From now on, if German or Italian\r\nvessels of war enter the waters, the protection of which is\r\nnecessary for American defense, they do so at their own peril.\r\n\r\nThe orders which I have given as Commander-in-Chief of the United\r\nStates Army and Navy are to carry out that policy--at once.\r\n\r\nThe sole responsibility rests upon Germany.  There will be no\r\nshooting unless Germany continues to seek it.\r\n\r\nThat is my obvious duty in this crisis.  That is the clear right of\r\nthis sovereign nation.  This is the only step possible, if we would\r\nkeep tight the wall of defense which we are pledged to maintain\r\naround this Western Hemisphere.\r\n\r\nI have no illusions about the gravity of this step.  I have not\r\ntaken it hurriedly or lightly.  It is the result of months and\r\nmonths of constant thought and anxiety and prayer.  In the\r\nprotection of your nation and mine it cannot be avoided.\r\n\r\nThe American people have faced other grave crises in their\r\nhistory--with American courage, and with American resolution.  They\r\nwill do no less today.\r\n\r\nThey know the actualities of the attacks upon us.  They know the\r\nnecessities of a bold defense against these attacks.  They know that\r\nthe times call for clear heads and fearless hearts.\r\n\r\nAnd with that inner strength that comes to a free people conscious\r\nof their duty, and conscious of the righteousness of what they do,\r\nthey will--with Divine help and guidance--stand their ground\r\nagainst this latest assault upon their democracy, their\r\nsovereignty, and their freedom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDecember 9, 1941.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Fellow Americans:\r\n\r\nThe sudden criminal attacks perpetrated by the Japanese in the\r\nPacific provide the climax of a decade of international immorality.\r\n\r\nPowerful and resourceful gangsters have banded together to make war\r\nupon the whole human race.  Their challenge has now been flung at\r\nthe United States of America.  The Japanese have treacherously\r\nviolated the long-standing peace between us.  Many American soldiers\r\nand sailors have been killed by enemy action.  American ships have\r\nbeen sunk; American airplanes have been destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe Congress and the people of the United States have accepted that\r\nchallenge.\r\n\r\nTogether with other free peoples, we are now fighting to maintain\r\nour right to live among our world neighbors in freedom, in common\r\ndecency, without fear of assault.\r\n\r\nI have prepared the full record of our past relations with Japan,\r\nand it will be submitted to the Congress.  It begins with the visit\r\nof Commodore Perry to Japan eighty-eight years ago.  It ends with\r\nthe visit of two Japanese emissaries to the Secretary of State last\r\nSunday, an hour after Japanese forces had loosed their bombs and\r\nmachine guns against our flag, our forces and our citizens.\r\n\r\nI can say with utmost confidence that no Americans, today or a\r\nthousand years hence, need feel anything but pride in our patience\r\nand in our efforts through all the years toward achieving a peace\r\nin the Pacific which would be fair and honorable to every nation,\r\nlarge or small.  And no honest person, today or a thousand years\r\nhence, will be able to suppress a sense of indignation and horror\r\nat the treachery committed by the military dictators of Japan,\r\nunder the very shadow of the flag of peace borne by their special\r\nenvoys in our midst.\r\n\r\nThe course that Japan has followed for the past ten years in Asia\r\nhas paralleled the course of Hitler and Mussolini in Europe and in\r\nAfrica.  Today, it has become far more than a parallel.  It is actual\r\ncollaboration so well calculated that all the continents of the\r\nworld, and all the oceans, are now considered by the Axis\r\nstrategists as one gigantic battlefield.\r\n\r\nIn 1931, ten years ago, Japan invaded Manchukuo--without warning.\r\n\r\nIn 1935, Italy invaded Ethiopia--without warning.  In 1938, Hitler\r\noccupied Austria--without warning.\r\n\r\nIn 1939, Hitler invaded Czechoslovakia--without warning.\r\n\r\nLater in '39, Hitler invaded Poland--without warning.\r\n\r\nIn 1940, Hitler invaded Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium\r\nand Luxembourg--without warning.\r\n\r\nIn 1940, Italy attacked France and later Greece--without warning.\r\n\r\nAnd this year, in 1941, the Axis Powers attacked Yugoslavia and\r\nGreece and they dominated the Balkans--without warning.\r\n\r\nIn 1941, also, Hitler invaded Russia--without warning.\r\n\r\nAnd now Japan has attacked Malaya and Thailand--and the United\r\nStates--without warning.\r\n\r\nIt is all of one pattern.\r\n\r\nWe are now in this war.  We are all in it--all the way.  Every single\r\nman, woman and child is a partner in the most tremendous\r\nundertaking of our American history.  We must share together the bad\r\nnews and the good news, the defeats and the victories--the changing\r\nfortunes of war.\r\n\r\nSo far, the news has been all bad.  We have suffered a serious\r\nsetback in Hawaii.  Our forces in the Philippines, which include the\r\nbrave people of that Commonwealth, are taking punishment, but are\r\ndefending themselves vigorously.  The reports from Guam and Wake and\r\nMidway Islands are still confused, but we must be prepared for the\r\nannouncement that all these three outposts have been seized.\r\n\r\nThe casualty lists of these first few days will undoubtedly be\r\nlarge.  I deeply feel the anxiety of all of the families of the men\r\nin our armed forces and the relatives of people in cities which\r\nhave been bombed.  I can only give them my solemn promise that they\r\nwill get news just as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\nThis government will put its trust in the stamina of the American\r\npeople, and will give the facts to the public just as soon as two\r\nconditions have been fulfilled:  first, that the information has\r\nbeen definitely and officially confirmed; and, second, that the\r\nrelease of the information at the time it is received will not\r\nprove valuable to the enemy directly or indirectly.\r\n\r\nMost earnestly I urge my countrymen to reject all rumors.  These\r\nugly little hints of complete disaster fly thick and fast in\r\nwartime.  They have to be examined and appraised.\r\n\r\nAs an example, I can tell you frankly that until further surveys\r\nare made, I have not sufficient information to state the exact\r\ndamage which has been done to our naval vessels at Pearl Harbor.\r\nAdmittedly the damage is serious.  But no one can say how serious,\r\nuntil we know how much of this damage can be repaired and how\r\nquickly the necessary repairs can be made.\r\n\r\nI cite as another example a statement made on Sunday night that a\r\nJapanese carrier had been located and sunk off the Canal Zone.  And\r\nwhen you hear statements that are attributed to what they call \"an\r\nauthoritative source,\" you can be reasonably sure from now on that\r\nunder these war circumstances the \"authoritative source\" is not any\r\nperson in authority.\r\n\r\nMany rumors and reports which we now hear originate with enemy\r\nsources.  For instance, today the Japanese are claiming that as a\r\nresult of their one action against Hawaii they hare gained naval\r\nsupremacy in the Pacific.  This is an old trick of propaganda which\r\nhas been used innumerable times by the Nazis.  The purposes of such\r\nfantastic claims are, of course, to spread fear and confusion among\r\nus, and to goad us into revealing military information which our\r\nenemies are desperately anxious to obtain.\r\n\r\nOur government will not be caught in this obvious trap--and neither\r\nwill the people of the United States.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered by each and every one of us that our free and\r\nrapid communication these days must be greatly restricted in\r\nwartime.  It is not possible to receive full and speedy and accurate\r\nreports front distant areas of combat.  This is particularly true\r\nwhere naval operations are concerned.  For in these days of the\r\nmarvels of the radio it is often impossible for the Commanders of\r\nvarious units to report their activities by radio at all, for the\r\nvery simple reason that this information would become available to\r\nthe enemy and would disclose their position and their plan of\r\ndefense or attack.\r\n\r\nOf necessity there will be delays in officially confirming or\r\ndenying reports of operations, but we will not hide facts from the\r\ncountry if we know the facts and if the enemy will not be aided by\r\ntheir disclosure.\r\n\r\nTo all newspapers and radio stations--all those who reach the eyes\r\nand ears of the American people--I say this:  You have a most grave\r\nresponsibility to the nation now and for the duration of this war.\r\n\r\nIf you feel that your government is not disclosing enough of the\r\ntruth, you have every right to say so.  But in the absence of all\r\nthe facts, as revealed by official sources, you have no right in\r\nthe ethics of patriotism to deal out unconfirmed reports in such a\r\nway as to make people believe that they are gospel truth.\r\n\r\nEvery citizen, in every walk of life, shares this same\r\nresponsibility.  The lives of our soldiers and sailors--the whole\r\nfuture of this nation--depend upon the manner in which each and\r\nevery one of us fulfills his obligation to our country.\r\n\r\nNow a word about the recent past--and the future.  A year and a half\r\nhas elapsed since the fall of France, when the whole world first\r\nrealized the mechanized might which the Axis nations had been\r\nbuilding up for so many years.  America has used that year and a\r\nhalf to great advantage.  Knowing that the attack might reach us in\r\nall too short a time, we immediately began greatly to increase our\r\nindustrial strength and our capacity to meet the demands of modern\r\nwarfare.\r\n\r\nPrecious months were gained by sending vast quantities of our war\r\nmaterial to the nations of the world still able to resist Axis\r\naggression.  Our policy rested on the fundamental truth that the\r\ndefense of any country resisting Hitler or Japan was in the long\r\nrun the defense of our own country.  That policy has been justified.\r\nIt has given us time, invaluable time, to build our American\r\nassembly lines of production.\r\n\r\nAssembly lines are now in operation.  Others are being rushed to\r\ncompletion.  A steady stream of tanks and planes, of guns and ships\r\nand shells and equipment--that is what these eighteen months have\r\ngiven us.\r\n\r\nBut it is all only a beginning of what still has to be done.  We\r\nmust be set to face a long war against crafty and powerful bandits.\r\nThe attack at Pearl Harbor can be repeated at any one of many\r\npoints, points in both oceans and along both our coast lines and\r\nagainst all the rest of the Hemisphere.\r\n\r\nIt will not only be a long war, it will be a hard war.  That is the\r\nbasis on which we now lay all our plans.  That is the yardstick by\r\nwhich we measure what we shall need and demand; money, materials,\r\ndoubled and quadrupled production--ever-increasing.  The production\r\nmust be not only for our own Army and Navy and air forces.  It must\r\nreinforce the other armies and navies and air forces fighting the\r\nNazis and the war lords of Japan throughout the Americas and\r\nthroughout the world.\r\n\r\nI have been working today on the subject of production.  Your\r\ngovernment has decided on two broad policies.\r\n\r\nThe first is to speed up all existing production by working on a\r\nseven day week basis in every war industry, including the\r\nproduction of essential raw materials.\r\n\r\nThe second policy, now being put into form, is to rush additions to\r\nthe capacity of production by building more new plants, by adding\r\nto old plants, and by using the many smaller plants for war needs.\r\n\r\nOver the hard road of the past months, we have at times met\r\nobstacles and difficulties, divisions and disputes, indifference\r\nand callousness.  That is now all past--and, I am sure, forgotten.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that the country now has an organization in Washington\r\nbuilt around men and women who are recognized experts in their own\r\nfields.  I think the country knows that the people who are actually\r\nresponsible in each and every one of these many fields are pulling\r\ntogether with a teamwork that has never before been excelled.\r\n\r\nOn the road ahead there lies hard work--grueling work--day and\r\nnight, every hour and every minute.\r\n\r\nI was about to add that ahead there lies sacrifice for all of us.\r\n\r\nBut it is not correct to use that word.  The United States does not\r\nconsider it a sacrifice to do all one can, to give one's best to\r\nour nation, when the nation is fighting for its existence and its\r\nfuture life.\r\n\r\nIt is not a sacrifice for any man, old or young, to be in the Army\r\nor the Navy of the United States.  Rather it is a privilege.\r\n\r\nIt is not a sacrifice for the industrialist or the wage earner, the\r\nfarmer or the shopkeeper, the trainman or the doctor, to pay more\r\ntaxes, to buy more bonds, to forego extra profits, to work longer\r\nor harder at the task for which he is best fitted.  Rather it is a\r\nprivilege.\r\n\r\nIt is not a sacrifice to do without many things to which we are\r\naccustomed if the national defense calls for doing without.\r\n\r\nA review this morning leads me to the conclusion that at present we\r\nshall not have to curtail the normal use of articles of food.  There\r\nis enough food today for all of us and enough left over to send to\r\nthose who are fighting on the same side with us.\r\n\r\nBut there will be a clear and definite shortage of metals for many\r\nkinds of civilian use, for the very good reason that in our\r\nincreased program we shall need for war purposes more than half of\r\nthat portion of the principal metals which during the past year\r\nhave gone into articles for civilian use.  Yes, we shall have to\r\ngive up many things entirely.\r\n\r\nAnd I am sure that the people in every part of the nation are\r\nprepared in their individual living to win this war.  I am sure that\r\nthey will cheerfully help to pay a large part of its financial cost\r\nwhile it goes on.  I am sure they will cheerfully give up those\r\nmaterial things that they are asked to give up.\r\n\r\nAnd I am sure that they will retain all those great spiritual\r\nthings without which we cannot win through.\r\n\r\nI repeat that the United States can accept no result save victory,\r\nfinal and complete.  Not only must the shame of Japanese treachery\r\nbe wiped out, but the sources of international brutality, wherever\r\nthey exist, must be absolutely and finally broken.\r\n\r\nIn my message to the Congress yesterday I said that we \"will make\r\nvery certain that this form of treachery shall never again endanger\r\nus.\"  In order to achieve that certainty, we must begin the great\r\ntask that is before us by abandoning once and for all the illusion\r\nthat we can ever again isolate ourselves from the rest of humanity.\r\n\r\nIn these past few years--and, most violently, in the past three\r\ndays--we have learned a terrible lesson.\r\n\r\nIt is our obligation to our dead--it is our sacred obligation to\r\ntheir children and to our children--that we must never forget what\r\nwe have learned.\r\n\r\nAnd what we have learned is this:\r\n\r\nThere is no such thing as security for any nation--or any\r\nindividual--in a world ruled by the principles of gangsterism.\r\n\r\nThere is no such thing as impregnable defense against powerful\r\naggressors who sneak up in the dark and strike without warning.\r\n\r\nWe have learned that our ocean-girt hemisphere is not immune from\r\nsevere attack--that we cannot measure our safety in terms of miles\r\non any map any more.\r\n\r\nWe may acknowledge that our enemies have performed a brilliant feat\r\nof deception, perfectly timed and executed with great skill.  It was\r\na thoroughly dishonorable deed, but we must face the fact that\r\nmodern warfare as conducted in the Nazi manner is a dirty business.\r\nWe don't like it--we didn't want to get in it--but we are in it and\r\nwe're going to fight it with everything we've got.\r\n\r\nI do not think any American has any doubt of our ability to\r\nadminister proper punishment to the perpetrators of these crimes.\r\n\r\nYour government knows that for weeks Germany has been telling Japan\r\nthat if Japan did not attack the United States, Japan would not\r\nshare in dividing the spoils with Germany when peace came.  She was\r\npromised by Germany that if she came in she would receive the\r\ncomplete and perpetual control of the whole of the Pacific area--\r\nand that means not only the Ear East, but also all of the Islands\r\nin the Pacific, and also a stranglehold on the west coast of North,\r\nCentral and South America.\r\n\r\nWe know also that Germany and Japan are conducting their military\r\nand naval operations in accordance with a joint plan.  That plan\r\nconsiders all peoples and nations which are not helping the Axis\r\npowers as common enemies of each and every one of the Axis powers.\r\n\r\nThat is their simple and obvious grand strategy.  And that is why\r\nthe American people must realize that it can be matched only with\r\nsimilar grand strategy.  We must realize for example that Japanese\r\nsuccesses against the United States in the Pacific are helpful to\r\nGerman operations in Libya; that any German success against the\r\nCaucasus is inevitably an assistance to Japan in her operations\r\nagainst the Dutch East Indies; that a German attack against Algiers\r\nor Morocco opens the way to a German attack against South America\r\nand the Canal.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the picture, we must learn also to know that\r\nguerrilla warfare against the Germans in, let us say Serbia or\r\nNorway, helps us; that a successful Russian offensive against the\r\nGermans helps us; and that British successes on land or sea in any\r\npart of the world strengthen our hands.\r\n\r\nRemember always that Germany and Italy, regardless of any formal\r\ndeclaration of war, consider themselves at war with the United\r\nStates at this moment just as much as they consider themselves at\r\nwar with Britain or Russia.  And Germany puts all the other\r\nRepublics of the Americas into the same category of enemies.  The\r\npeople of our sister Republics of this Hemisphere can be honored by\r\nthat fact.\r\n\r\nThe true goal we seek is far above and beyond the ugly field of\r\nbattle.  When we resort to force, as now we must, we are determined\r\nthat this force shall be directed toward ultimate good as well as\r\nagainst immediate evil.  We Americans are not destroyers--we are\r\nbuilders.\r\n\r\nWe are now in the midst of a war, not for conquest, not for\r\nvengeance, but for a world in which this nation, and all that this\r\nnation represents, will be safe for our children.  We expect to\r\neliminate the danger from Japan, but it would serve us ill if we\r\naccomplished that and found that the rest of the world was\r\ndominated by Hitler and Mussolini.\r\n\r\nSo we are going to win the war and we are going to win the peace\r\nthat follows.\r\n\r\nAnd in the difficult hours of this day--through dark days that may\r\nbe yet to come--we will know that the vast majority of the members\r\nof the human race are on our side.  Many of them are fighting with\r\nus.  All of them are praying for us.  But, in representing our cause,\r\nwe represent theirs as well--our hope and their hope for liberty\r\nunder God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFebruary 23, 1942.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Fellow Americans:\r\n\r\nWashington's Birthday is a most appropriate occasion for us to talk\r\nwith each other about things as they are today and things as we\r\nknow they shall be in the future.\r\n\r\nFor eight years, General Washington and his Continental Army were\r\nfaced continually with formidable odds and recurring defeats.\r\nSupplies and equipment were lacking.  In a sense, every winter was a\r\nValley Forge.  Throughout the thirteen states there existed fifth\r\ncolumnists--and selfish men, jealous men, fearful men, who\r\nproclaimed that Washington's cause was hopeless, and that he should\r\nask for a negotiated peace.\r\n\r\nWashington's conduct in those hard times has provided the model for\r\nall Americans ever since--a model of moral stamina.  He held to his\r\ncourse, as it had been charted in the Declaration of Independence.\r\nHe and the brave men who served with him knew that no man's life or\r\nfortune was secure without freedom and free institutions.\r\n\r\nThe present great struggle has taught us increasingly that freedom\r\nof person and security of property anywhere in the world depend\r\nupon the security of the rights and obligations of liberty and\r\njustice everywhere in the world.\r\n\r\nThis war is a new kind of war.  It is different from all other wars\r\nof the past, not only in its methods and weapons but also in its\r\ngeography.  It is warfare in terms of every continent, every island,\r\nevery sea, every air lane in the world.\r\n\r\nThat is the reason why I have asked you to take out and spread\r\nbefore you a map of the whole earth, and to follow with me in the\r\nreferences which I shall make to the world-encircling battle lines\r\nof this war.  Many questions will, I fear, remain unanswered\r\ntonight; but I know you will realize that I cannot cover everything\r\nin any one short report to the people.\r\n\r\nThe broad oceans which have been heralded in the past as our\r\nprotection from attack have become endless battlefields on which we\r\nare constantly being challenged by our enemies.\r\n\r\nWe must all understand and face the hard fact that our job now is\r\nto fight at distances which extend all the way around the globe.\r\n\r\nWe fight at these vast distances because that is where our enemies\r\nare.  Until our flow of supplies gives us clear superiority we must\r\nkeep on striking our enemies wherever and whenever we can meet\r\nthem, even if, for a while, we have to yield ground.  Actually,\r\nthough, we are taking a heavy toll of the enemy every day that goes\r\nby.\r\n\r\nWe must fight at these vast distances to protect our supply lines\r\nand our lines of communication with our allies--protect these lines\r\nfrom the enemies who are bending every ounce of their strength,\r\nstriving against time, to cut them.  The object of the Nazis and the\r\nJapanese is to separate the United States, Britain, China and\r\nRussia, and to isolate them one from another, so that each will be\r\nsurrounded and cut off from sources of supplies and reinforcements.\r\nIt is the old familiar Axis policy of \"divide and conquer.\"\r\n\r\nThere are those who still think, however, in terms of the days of\r\nsailing-ships.  They advise us to pull our warships and our planes\r\nand our merchant ships into our own home waters and concentrate\r\nsolely on last ditch defense.  But let me illustrate what would\r\nhappen if we followed such foolish advice.\r\n\r\nLook at your map.  Look at the vast area of China, with its millions\r\nof fighting men.  Look at the vast area of Russia, with its powerful\r\narmies and proven military might.  Look at the British Isles,\r\nAustralia, New Zealand, the Dutch Indies, India, the Near East and\r\nthe Continent of Africa, with their resources of raw materials, and\r\nof peoples determined to resist Axis domination.  Look too at North\r\nAmerica, Central America and South America.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious what would happen if all of these great reservoirs of\r\npower were cut off from each other either by enemy action or by\r\nself-imposed isolation:\r\n\r\nFirst, in such a case, we could no longer send aid of any kind to\r\nChina--to the brave people who, for nearly five years, have\r\nwithstood Japanese assault, destroyed hundreds of thousands of\r\nJapanese soldiers and vast quantities of Japanese war munitions.  It\r\nis essential that we help China in her magnificent defense and in\r\nher inevitable counteroffensive--for that is one important element\r\nin the ultimate defeat of Japan.\r\n\r\nSecond, if we lost communication with the southwest Pacific, all of\r\nthat area, including Australia and New Zealand and the Dutch\r\nIndies, would fall under Japanese domination.  Japan in such a case\r\ncould release great numbers of ships and men to launch attacks on a\r\nlarge scale against the coasts of the Western Hemisphere--South\r\nAmerica and Central America, and North America--including Alaska.\r\nAt the same time, she could immediately extend her conquests in the\r\nother direction toward India, and through the Indian Ocean to\r\nAfrica, to the Near East, and try to join forces with Germany and\r\nItaly.\r\n\r\nThird, if we were to stop sending munitions to the British and the\r\nRussians in the Mediterranean, in the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea,\r\nwe would be helping the Nazis to overrun Turkey, Syria, Iraq,\r\nPersia, Egypt and the Suez Canal, the whole coast of North Africa\r\nitself, and with that inevitably the whole coast of West Africa--\r\nputting Germany within easy striking distance of South America--\r\nfifteen hundred miles away.\r\n\r\nFourth, if by such a fatuous policy we ceased to protect the North\r\nAtlantic supply line to Britain and to Russia, we would help to\r\ncripple the splendid counter-offensive by Russia against the Nazis,\r\nand we would help to deprive Britain of essential food supplies and\r\nmunitions.\r\n\r\nThose Americans who believed that we could live under the illusion\r\nof isolationism wanted the American eagle to imitate the tactics of\r\nthe ostrich.  Now, many of those same people, afraid that we may be\r\nsticking our necks out, want our national bird to be turned into a\r\nturtle.  But we prefer to retain the eagle as it is--flying high and\r\nstriking hard.\r\n\r\nI know that I speak for the mass of the American people when I say\r\nthat we reject the turtle policy and will continue increasingly the\r\npolicy of carrying the war to the enemy in distant lands and\r\ndistant waters--as far away as possible from our own home grounds.\r\n\r\nThere are four main lines of communication now being travelled by\r\nour ships:  the North Atlantic, the South Atlantic, the Indian Ocean\r\nand the South Pacific.  These routes are not one-way streets, for\r\nthe ships that carry our troops and munitions outbound bring back\r\nessential raw materials which we require for our own use.\r\n\r\nThe maintenance of these vital lines is a very tough job.  It is a\r\njob which requires tremendous daring, tremendous resourcefulness,\r\nand, above all, tremendous production of planes and tanks and guns\r\nand also of the ships to carry them.  And I speak again for the\r\nAmerican people when I say that we can and will do that job.\r\n\r\nThe defense of the world-wide lines of communication demands\r\nrelatively safe use by us of the sea and of the air along the\r\nvarious routes; and this, in turn, depends upon control by the\r\nUnited Nations of many strategic bases along those routes.\r\n\r\nControl of the air involves the simultaneous use of two types of\r\nplanes--first, the long-range heavy bomber; and, second, the light\r\nbombers, dive bombers, torpedo planes, and short-range pursuit\r\nplanes, all of which are essential to the protection of the bases\r\nand of the bombers themselves.\r\n\r\nHeavy bombers can fly under their own power from here to the\r\nsouthwest Pacific, but the smaller planes cannot.  Therefore, these\r\nlighter planes have to be packed in crates and sent on board cargo\r\nships.  Look at your map again; and you will see that the route is\r\nlong--and at many places perilous--either across the South Atlantic\r\nall the way around South Africa and the Cape of Good Hope, or from\r\nCalifornia to the East Indies direct.  A vessel can make a round\r\ntrip by either route in about four months, or only three round\r\ntrips in a whole year.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the length, and in spite of the difficulties of this\r\ntransportation, I can tell you that in two and a half months we\r\nalready have a large number of bombers and pursuit planes, manned\r\nby American pilots and crews, which are now in daily contact with\r\nthe enemy in the Southwest Pacific.  And thousands of American\r\ntroops are today in that area engaged in operations not only in the\r\nair but on the ground as well.\r\n\r\nIn this battle area, Japan has had an obvious initial advantage.\r\nFor she could fly even her short-range planes to the points of\r\nattack by using many stepping stones open to her--bases in a\r\nmultitude of Pacific islands and also bases on the China coast,\r\nIndo-China coast, and in Thailand and Malaya coasts.  Japanese troop\r\ntransports could go south from Japan and from China through the\r\nnarrow China Sea, which can be protected by Japanese planes\r\nthroughout its whole length.\r\n\r\nI ask you to look at your maps again, particularly at that portion\r\nof the Pacific Ocean lying west of Hawaii.  Before this war even\r\nstarted, the Philippine Islands were already surrounded on three\r\nsides by Japanese power.  On the west, the China side, the Japanese\r\nwere in possession of the coast of China and the coast of\r\nIndo-China which had been yielded to them by the Vichy French.  On\r\nthe North are the islands of Japan themselves, reaching down almost\r\nto northern Luzon.  On the east are the Mandated Islands--which\r\nJapan had occupied exclusively, and had fortified in absolute\r\nviolation of her written word.\r\n\r\nThe islands that lie between Hawaii and the Philippines--these\r\nislands, hundreds of them, appear only as small dots on most maps.\r\nBut they cover a large strategic area.  Guam lies in the middle of\r\nthem--a lone outpost which we have never fortified.\r\n\r\nUnder the Washington Treaty of 1921 we had solemnly agreed not to\r\nadd to the fortification of the Philippines.  We had no safe naval\r\nbases there, so we could not use the islands for extensive naval\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nImmediately after this war started, the Japanese forces moved down\r\non either side of the Philippines to numerous points south of\r\nthem--thereby completely encircling the Philippines from north,\r\nsouth, east and west.\r\n\r\nIt is that complete encirclement, with control of the air by\r\nJapanese land-based aircraft, which has prevented us from sending\r\nsubstantial reinforcements of men and material to the gallant\r\ndefenders of the Philippines.  For forty years it has always been\r\nour strategy--a strategy born of necessity--that in the event of a\r\nfull-scale attack on the Islands by Japan, we should fight a\r\ndelaying action, attempting to retire slowly into Bataan Peninsula\r\nand Corregidor.\r\n\r\nWe knew that the war as a whole would have to be fought and won by\r\na process of attrition against Japan itself.  We knew all along\r\nthat, with our greater resources, we could ultimately out-build\r\nJapan and ultimately overwhelm her on sea, and on land and in the\r\nair.  We knew that, to obtain our objective, many varieties of\r\noperations would be necessary in areas other than the Philippines.\r\n\r\nNow nothing that has occurred in the past two months has caused us\r\nto revise this basic strategy of necessity--except that the defense\r\nput up by General MacArthur has magnificently exceeded the previous\r\nestimates of endurance, and he and his men are gaining eternal\r\nglory therefore.\r\n\r\nMacArthur's army of Filipinos and Americans, and the forces of the\r\nUnited Nations in China, in Burma and the Netherlands East Indies,\r\nare all together fulfilling the same essential task.  They are\r\nmaking Japan pay an increasingly terrible price for her ambitious\r\nattempts to seize control of the whole Asiatic world.  Every\r\nJapanese transport sunk off Java is one less transport that they\r\ncan use to carry reinforcements to their army opposing General\r\nMacArthur in Luzon.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that Japanese gains in the Philippines were made\r\npossible only by the success of their surprise attack on Pearl\r\nHarbor.  I tell you that this is not so.\r\n\r\nEven if the attack had not been made your map will show that it\r\nwould have been a hopeless operation for us to send the Fleet to\r\nthe Philippines through thousands of miles of ocean, while all\r\nthose island bases were under the sole control of the Japanese.\r\n\r\nThe consequences of the attack on Pearl Harbor--serious as they\r\nwere--have been wildly exaggerated in other ways.  And these\r\nexaggerations come originally from Axis propagandists; but they\r\nhave been repeated, I regret to say, by Americans in and out of\r\npublic life.\r\n\r\nYou and I have the utmost contempt for Americans who, since Pearl\r\nHarbor, have whispered or announced \"off the record\" that there was\r\nno longer any Pacific Fleet--that the Fleet was all sunk or\r\ndestroyed on December 7th--that more than a thousand of our planes\r\nwere destroyed on the ground.  They have suggested slyly that the\r\ngovernment has withheld the truth about casualties--that eleven or\r\ntwelve thousand men were killed at Pearl Harbor instead of the\r\nfigures as officially announced.  They have even served the enemy\r\npropagandists by spreading the incredible story that ship-loads of\r\nbodies of our honored American dead were about to arrive in New\r\nYork harbor to be put into a common grave.\r\n\r\nAlmost every Axis broadcast--Berlin, Rome, Tokyo--directly quotes\r\nAmericans who, by speech or in the press, make damnable\r\nmisstatements such as these.\r\n\r\nThe American people realize that in many cases details of military\r\noperations cannot be disclosed until we are absolutely certain that\r\nthe announcement will not give to the enemy military information\r\nwhich he does not already possess.\r\n\r\nYour government has unmistakable confidence in your ability to hear\r\nthe worst, without flinching or losing heart.  You must, in turn,\r\nhave complete confidence that your government is keeping nothing\r\nfrom you except information that will help the enemy in his attempt\r\nto destroy us.  In a democracy there is always a solemn pact of\r\ntruth between government and the people, but there must also always\r\nbe a full use of discretion, and that word \"discretion\" applies to\r\nthe critics of government as well.\r\n\r\nThis is war.  The American people want to know, and will be told,\r\nthe general trend of how the war is going.  But they do not wish to\r\nhelp the enemy any more than our fighting forces do, and they will\r\npay little attention to the rumor-mongers and the poison peddlers\r\nin our midst.\r\n\r\nTo pass from the realm of rumor and poison to the field of facts:\r\nthe number of our officers and men killed in the attack on Pearl\r\nHarbor on December seventh was 2,340, and the number wounded was\r\n940.  Of all of the combatant ships based on Pearl Harbor--\r\nbattleships, heavy cruisers, light cruisers, aircraft carriers,\r\ndestroyers and submarines--only three are permanently put out of\r\ncommission.\r\n\r\nVery many of the ships of the Pacific Fleet were not even in Pearl\r\nHarbor.  Some of those that were there were hit very slightly, and\r\nothers that were damaged have either rejoined the fleet by now or\r\nare still undergoing repairs.  And when those repairs are completed,\r\nthe ships will be more efficient fighting machines than they were\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nThe report that we lost more than a thousand planes at Pearl Harbor\r\nis as baseless as the other weird rumors.  The Japanese do not know\r\njust how many planes they destroyed that day, and I am not going to\r\ntell them.  But I can say that to date--and including Pearl Harbor--\r\nwe have destroyed considerably more Japanese planes than they have\r\ndestroyed of ours.\r\n\r\nWe have most certainly suffered losses--from Hitler's U-Boats in\r\nthe Atlantic as well as from the Japanese in the Pacific--and we\r\nshall suffer more of them before the turn of the tide.  But,\r\nspeaking for the United States of America, let me say once and for\r\nall to the people of the world:  We Americans have been compelled to\r\nyield ground, but we will regain it.  We and the other United\r\nNations are committed to the destruction of the militarism of Japan\r\nand Germany.  We are daily increasing our strength.  Soon, we and not\r\nour enemies, will have the offensive; we, not they, will win the\r\nfinal battles; and we, not they, will make the final peace.\r\n\r\nConquered nations in Europe know what the yoke of the Nazis is\r\nlike.  And the people of Korea and of Manchuria know in their flesh\r\nthe harsh despotism of Japan.  All of the people of Asia know that\r\nif there is to be an honorable and decent future for any of them or\r\nany of us, that future depends on victory by the United Nations\r\nover the forces of Axis enslavement.\r\n\r\nIf a just and durable peace is to be attained, or even if all of us\r\nare merely to save our own skins, there is one thought for us here\r\nat home to keep uppermost--the fulfillment of our special task of\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\nGermany, Italy and Japan are very close to their maximum output of\r\nplanes, guns, tanks and ships.  The United Nations are not--\r\nespecially the United States of America.\r\n\r\nOur first job then is to build up production--uninterrupted\r\nproduction--so that the United Nations can maintain control of the\r\nseas and attain control of the air--not merely a slight\r\nsuperiority, but an overwhelming superiority.\r\n\r\nOn January 6th of this year, I set certain definite goals of\r\nproduction for airplanes, tanks, guns and ships.  The Axis\r\npropagandists called them fantastic.  Tonight, nearly two months\r\nlater, and after a careful survey of progress by Donald Nelson and\r\nothers charged with responsibility for our production, I can tell\r\nyou that those goals will be attained.\r\n\r\nIn every part of the country, experts in production and the men and\r\nwomen at work in the plants are giving loyal service.  With few\r\nexceptions, labor, capital and farming realize that this is no time\r\neither to make undue profits or to gain special advantages, one\r\nover the other.\r\n\r\nWe are calling for new plants and additions--additions to old\r\nplants.  We are calling for plant conversion to war needs.  We are\r\nseeking more men and more women to run them.  We are working longer\r\nhours.  We are coming to realize that one extra plane or extra tank\r\nor extra gun or extra ship completed tomorrow may, in a few months,\r\nturn the tide on some distant battlefield; it may make the\r\ndifference between life and death for some of our own fighting men.\r\nWe know now that if we lose this war it will be generations or even\r\ncenturies before our conception of democracy can live again.  And we\r\ncan lose this war only if use slow up our effort or if we waste our\r\nammunition sniping at each other.\r\n\r\nHere are three high purposes for every American:\r\n\r\n1.  We shall not stop work for a single day.  If any dispute arises\r\nwe shall keep on working while the dispute is solved by mediation,\r\nor conciliation or arbitration--until the war is won.\r\n\r\n2.  We shall not demand special gains or special privileges or\r\nspecial advantages for any one group or occupation.\r\n\r\n3.  We shall give up conveniences and modify the routine of our\r\nlives if our country asks us to do so.  We will do it cheerfully,\r\nremembering that the common enemy seeks to destroy every home and\r\nevery freedom in every part of our land.\r\n\r\nThis generation of Americans has come to realize, with a present\r\nand personal realization, that there is something larger and more\r\nimportant than the life of any individual or of any individual\r\ngroup--something for which a man will sacrifice, and gladly\r\nsacrifice, not only his pleasures, not only his goods, not only his\r\nassociations with those he loves, but his life itself.  In time of\r\ncrisis when the future is in the balance, we come to understand,\r\nwith full recognition and devotion, what this nation is and what we\r\nowe to it.\r\n\r\nThe Axis propagandists have tried in various evil ways to destroy\r\nour determination and our morale.  Failing in that, they are now\r\ntrying to destroy our confidence in our own allies.  They say that\r\nthe British are finished--that the Russians and the Chinese are\r\nabout to quit.  Patriotic and sensible Americans will reject these\r\nabsurdities.  And instead of listening to any of this crude\r\npropaganda, they will recall some of the things that Nazis and\r\nJapanese have said and are still saying about us.\r\n\r\nEver since this nation became the arsenal of democracy--ever since\r\nenactment of Lend-Lease--there has been one persistent theme\r\nthrough all Axis propaganda.\r\n\r\nThis theme has been that Americans are admittedly rich, that\r\nAmericans have considerable industrial power--but that Americans\r\nare soft and decadent, that they cannot and will not unite and work\r\nand fight.\r\n\r\nFrom Berlin, Rome and Tokyo we have been described as a nation of\r\nweaklings--\"playboys\"--who would hire British soldiers, or Russian\r\nsoldiers, or Chinese soldiers to do our fighting for us.\r\n\r\nLet them repeat that now!\r\n\r\nLet them tell that to General MacArthur and his men.\r\n\r\nLet them tell that to the sailors who today are hitting hard in the\r\nfar waters of the Pacific.\r\n\r\nLet them tell that to the boys in the Flying Fortresses.\r\n\r\nLet them tell that to the Marines!\r\n\r\nThe United Nations constitute an association of independent peoples\r\nof equal dignity and equal importance.  The United Nations are\r\ndedicated to a common cause.  We share equally and with equal zeal\r\nthe anguish and the awful sacrifices of war.  In the partnership of\r\nour common enterprise, we must share in a unified plan in which all\r\nof us must play our several parts, each of us being equally\r\nindispensable and dependent one on the other.\r\n\r\nWe have unified command and cooperation and comradeship.\r\n\r\nWe Americans will contribute unified production and unified\r\nacceptance of sacrifice and of effort.  That means a national unity\r\nthat can know no limitations of race or creed or selfish politics.\r\nThe American people expect that much from themselves.  And the\r\nAmerican people will find ways and means of expressing their\r\ndetermination to their enemies, including the Japanese Admiral who\r\nhas said that he will dictate the terms of peace here in the White\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\nWe of the United Nations are agreed on certain broad principles in\r\nthe kind of peace we seek.  The Atlantic Charter applies not only to\r\nthe parts of the world that border the Atlantic but to the whole\r\nworld; disarmament of aggressors, self-determination of nations and\r\npeoples, and the four freedoms--freedom of speech, freedom of\r\nreligion, freedom from want, and freedom from fear.\r\n\r\nThe British and the Russian people have known the full fury of Nazi\r\nonslaught.  There have been times when the fate of London and Moscow\r\nwas in serious doubt.  But there was never the slightest question\r\nthat either the British or the Russians would yield.  And today all\r\nthe United Nations salute the superb Russian Army as it celebrates\r\nthe twenty-fourth anniversary of its first assembly.\r\n\r\nThough their homeland was overrun, the Dutch people are still\r\nfighting stubbornly and powerfully overseas.\r\n\r\nThe great Chinese people have suffered grievous losses; Chungking\r\nhas been almost wiped out of existence--yet it remains the capital\r\nof an unbeatable China.\r\n\r\nThat is the conquering spirit which prevails throughout the United\r\nNations in this war.\r\n\r\nThe task that we Americans now face will test us to the uttermost.\r\nNever before have we been called upon for such a prodigious effort.\r\nNever before have we had so little time in which to do so much.\r\n\r\n\"These are the times that try men's souls.\"  Tom Paine wrote those\r\nwords on a drumhead, by the light of a campfire.  That was when\r\nWashington's little army of ragged, rugged men was retreating\r\nacross New Jersey, having tasted nothing but defeat.\r\n\r\nAnd General Washington ordered that these great words written by\r\nTom Paine be read to the men of every regiment in the Continental\r\nArmy, and this was the assurance given to the first American armed\r\nforces:\r\n\r\n\"The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis,\r\nshrink from the service of their country; but he that stands it\r\nnow, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman.  Tyranny, like\r\nhell, is not easily conquered, yet we have this consolation with\r\nus, that the harder the sacrifice, the more glorious the triumph.\"\r\n\r\nSo spoke Americans in the year 1776.\r\n\r\nSo speak Americans today!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApril 28, 1942.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Fellow Americans:\r\n\r\nIt is nearly five months since we were attacked at Pearl Harbor.\r\nFor the two years prior to that attack this country had been\r\ngearing itself up to a high level of production of munitions.  And\r\nyet our war efforts had done little to dislocate the normal lives\r\nof most of us.\r\n\r\nSince then we have dispatched strong forces of our Army and Navy,\r\nseveral hundred thousand of them, to bases and battlefronts\r\nthousands of miles from home.  We have stepped up our war production\r\non a scale that is testing our industrial power, our engineering\r\ngenius and our economic structure to the utmost.  We have had no\r\nillusions about the fact that this is a tough job--and a long one.\r\n\r\nAmerican warships are now in combat in the North and South\r\nAtlantic, in the Arctic, in the Mediterranean, in the Indian Ocean,\r\nand in the North and South Pacific.  American troops have taken\r\nstations in South America, Greenland, Iceland, the British Isles,\r\nthe Near East, the Middle East and the Far East, the continent of\r\nAustralia, and many islands of the Pacific.  American war planes,\r\nmanned by Americans, are flying in actual combat over all the\r\ncontinents and all the oceans.\r\n\r\nOn the European front the most important development of the past\r\nyear has been without question the crushing counteroffensive on the\r\npart of the great armies of Russia against the powerful German\r\narmy.  These Russian forces have destroyed and are destroying more\r\narmed power of our enemies--troops, planes, tanks and guns--than\r\nall the other United Nations put together.\r\n\r\nIn the Mediterranean area, matters remain on the surface much as\r\nthey were.  But the situation there is receiving very careful\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nRecently we received news of a change in government in what we used\r\nto know as the Republic of France--a name dear to the hearts of all\r\nlovers of liberty--a name and an institution which we hope will\r\nsoon be restored to full dignity.\r\n\r\nThroughout the Nazi occupation of France, we have hoped for the\r\nmaintenance of a French government which would strive to regain\r\nindependence, to reestablish the principles of \"Liberty, Equality\r\nand Fraternity,\" and to restore the historic culture of France.  Our\r\npolicy has been consistent from the very beginning.  However, we are\r\nnow greatly concerned lest those who have recently come to power\r\nmay seek to force the brave French people into submission to Nazi\r\ndespotism.\r\n\r\nThe United Nations will take measures, if necessary, to prevent the\r\nuse of French territory in any part of the world for military\r\npurposes by the Axis powers.  The good people of France will readily\r\nunderstand that such action is essential for the United Nations to\r\nprevent assistance to the armies or navies or air forces of\r\nGermany, or Italy or Japan.  The overwhelming majority of the French\r\npeople understand that the fight of the United Nations is\r\nfundamentally their fight, that our victory means the restoration\r\nof a free and independent France--and the saving of France from the\r\nslavery which would be imposed upon her by her external enemies and\r\nby her internal traitors.\r\n\r\nWe know how the French people really feel.  We know that a deep-\r\nseated determination to obstruct every step in the Axis plan\r\nextends from occupied France through Vichy France all the way to\r\nthe people of their colonies in every ocean and on every continent.\r\n\r\nOur planes are helping in the defense of French colonies today, and\r\nsoon American Flying Fortresses will be fighting for the liberation\r\nof the darkened continent of Europe itself.\r\n\r\nIn all the occupied countries there are men and women, and even\r\nlittle children who have never stopped fighting, never stopped\r\nresisting, never stopped proving to the Nazis that their so-called\r\n\"New Order\" will never be enforced upon free peoples.\r\n\r\nIn the German and Italian peoples themselves there is a growing\r\nconviction that the cause of Nazism and Fascism is hopeless--that\r\ntheir political and military leaders have led them along the bitter\r\nroad which leads not to world conquest but to final defeat.  They\r\ncannot fail to contrast the present frantic speeches of these\r\nleaders with their arrogant boastings of a year ago, and two years\r\nago.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the world, in the Far East, we have passed\r\nthrough a phase of serious losses.\r\n\r\nWe have inevitably lost control of a large portion of the\r\nPhilippine Islands.  But this whole nation pays tribute to the\r\nFilipino and American officers and men who held out so long on\r\nBataan Peninsula, to those grim and gallant fighters who still hold\r\nCorregidor, where the flag flies, and to the forces that are still\r\nstriking effectively at the enemy on Mindanao and other islands.\r\n\r\nThe Malayan Peninsula and Singapore are in the hands of the enemy;\r\nthe Netherlands East Indies are almost entirely occupied, though\r\nresistance there continues.  Many other islands are in the\r\npossession of the Japanese.  But there is good reason to believe\r\nthat their southward advance has been checked.  Australia, New\r\nZealand, and much other territory will be bases for offensive\r\naction--and we are determined that the territory that has been lost\r\nwill be regained.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese are pressing their northward advance against Burma\r\nwith considerable power, driving toward India and China.  They have\r\nbeen opposed with great bravery by small British and Chinese forces\r\naided by American fliers.\r\n\r\nThe news in Burma tonight is not good.  The Japanese may cut the\r\nBurma Road; but I want to say to the gallant people of China that\r\nno matter what advances the Japanese may make, ways will be found\r\nto deliver airplanes and munitions of war to the armies of\r\nGeneralissimo Chiang Kai-shek.\r\n\r\nWe remember that the Chinese people were the first to stand up and\r\nfight against the aggressors in this war; and in the future a still\r\nunconquerable China will play its proper role in maintaining peace\r\nand prosperity, not only in Eastern Asia but in the whole world.\r\n\r\nFor every advance that the Japanese have made since they started\r\ntheir frenzied career of conquest, they have had to pay a very\r\nheavy toll in warships, in transports, in planes, and in men.  They\r\nare feeling the effects of those losses.\r\n\r\nIt is even reported from Japan that somebody has dropped bombs on\r\nTokyo, and on other principal centers of Japanese war industries.\r\nIf this be true, it is the first time in history that Japan has\r\nsuffered such indignities.\r\n\r\nAlthough the treacherous attack on Pearl Harbor was the immediate\r\ncause of our entry into the war, that event found the American\r\npeople spiritually prepared for war on a world-wide scale.  We went\r\ninto this war fighting.  We know what we are fighting for.  We\r\nrealize that the war has become what Hitler originally proclaimed\r\nit to be--a total war.\r\n\r\nNot all of us can have the privilege of fighting our enemies in\r\ndistant parts of the world.\r\n\r\nNot all of us can have the privilege of working in a munitions\r\nfactory or a shipyard, or on the farms or in oil fields or mines,\r\nproducing the weapons or the raw materials that are needed by our\r\narmed forces.\r\n\r\nBut there is one front and one battle where everyone in the United\r\nStates--every man, woman, and child--is in action, and will be\r\nprivileged to remain in action throughout this war.  That front is\r\nright here at home, in our daily lives, and in our daily tasks.\r\nHere at home everyone will have the privilege of making whatever\r\nself-denial is necessary, not only to supply our fighting men, but\r\nto keep the economic structure of our country fortified and secure\r\nduring the war and after the war.  This will require, of course, the\r\nabandonment not only of luxuries but of many other creature\r\ncomforts.\r\n\r\nEvery loyal American is aware of his individual responsibility.\r\nWhenever I hear anyone saying \"The American people are complacent--\r\nthey need to be aroused,\" I feel like asking him to come to\r\nWashington to read the mail that floods into the White House and\r\ninto all departments of this government.  The one question that\r\nrecurs through all these thousands of letters and messages is \"What\r\nmore can I do to help my country in winning this war\"?\r\n\r\nTo build the factories, to buy the materials, to pay the labor, to\r\nprovide the transportation, to equip and feed and house the\r\nsoldiers, sailors and marines, and to do all the thousands of\r\nthings necessary in a war--all cost a lot of money, more money than\r\nhas ever been spent by any nation at any time in the long history\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\nWe are now spending, solely for war purposes, the sum of about one\r\nhundred million dollars every day in the week.  But, before this\r\nyear is over, that almost unbelievable rate of expenditure will be\r\ndoubled.\r\n\r\nAll of this money has to be spent--and spent quickly--if we are to\r\nproduce within the time now available the enormous quantities of\r\nweapons of war which we need.  But the spending of these tremendous\r\nsums presents grave danger of disaster to our national economy.\r\n\r\nWhen your government continues to spend these unprecedented sums\r\nfor munitions month by month and year by year, that money goes into\r\nthe pocketbooks and bank accounts of the people of the United\r\nStates.  At the same time raw materials and many manufactured goods\r\nare necessarily taken away from civilian use, and machinery and\r\nfactories are being converted to war production.\r\n\r\nYou do not have to be a professor of mathematics or economics to\r\nsee that if people with plenty of cash start bidding against each\r\nother for scarce goods, the price of those goods goes up.\r\n\r\nYesterday I submitted to the Congress of the United states a seven-\r\npoint program of general principles which taken together could be\r\ncalled the national economic policy for attaining the great\r\nobjective of keeping the cost of living down.\r\n\r\nI repeat them now to you in substance:\r\n\r\nFirst. we must, through heavier taxes, keep personal and corporate\r\nprofits at a low reasonable rate.\r\n\r\nSecond.  We must fix ceilings on prices and rents.\r\n\r\nThird.  We must stabilize wages.\r\n\r\nFourth.  We must stabilize farm prices.\r\n\r\nFifth.  We must put more billions into war bonds.\r\n\r\nSixth.  We must ration all essential commodities which are scarce.\r\n\r\nSeventh.  We must discourage installment buying, and encourage\r\npaying off debts and mortgages.\r\n\r\nI do not think it is necessary to repeat what I said yesterday to\r\nthe Congress in discussing these general principles.\r\n\r\nThe important thing to remember is that each one of these points is\r\ndependent on the others if the whole program is to work.\r\n\r\nSome people are already taking the position that every one of the\r\nseven points is correct except the one point which steps on their\r\nown individual toes.  A few seem very willing to approve self-\r\ndenial--on the part of their neighbors.  The only effective course\r\nof action is a simultaneous attack on all of the factors which\r\nincrease the cost of living, in one comprehensive, all-embracing\r\nprogram covering prices, and profits, and wages, and taxes and\r\ndebts.\r\n\r\nThe blunt fact is that every single person in the United States is\r\ngoing to be affected by this program.  Some of you will be affected\r\nmore directly by one or two of these restrictive measures, but all\r\nof you will be affected indirectly by all of them.\r\n\r\nAre you a businessman, or do you own stock in a business\r\ncorporation?  Well, your profits are going to be cut down to a\r\nreasonably low level by taxation.  Your income will be subject to\r\nhigher taxes.  Indeed in these days, when every available dollar\r\nshould go to the war effort, I do not think that any American\r\ncitizen should have a net income in excess of $25,000 per year\r\nafter payment of taxes.\r\n\r\nAre you a retailer or a wholesaler or a manufacturer or a farmer or\r\na landlord?  Ceilings are being placed on the prices at which you\r\ncan sell your goods or rent your property.\r\n\r\nDo you work for wages?  You will have to forego higher wages for\r\nyour particular job for the duration of the war.\r\n\r\nAll of us are used to spending money for things that we want,\r\nthings, however, which are not absolutely essential.  We will all\r\nhave to forego that kind of spending.  Because we must put every\r\ndime and every dollar we can possibly spare out of our earnings\r\ninto war bonds and stamps.  Because the demands of the war effort\r\nrequire the rationing of goods of which there is not enough to go\r\naround.  Because the stopping of purchases of non-essentials will\r\nrelease thousands of workers who are needed in the war effort.\r\n\r\nAs I told the Congress yesterday, \"sacrifice\" is not exactly the\r\nproper word with which to describe this program of self-denial.\r\nWhen, at the end of this great struggle we shall have saved our\r\nfree way of life, we shall have made no \"sacrifice.\"\r\n\r\nThe price for civilization must be paid in hard work and sorrow and\r\nblood.  The price is not too high.  If you doubt it, ask those\r\nmillions who live today under the tyranny of Hitlerism.\r\n\r\nAsk the workers of France and Norway and the Netherlands, whipped\r\nto labor by the lash, whether the stabilization of wages is too\r\ngreat a \"sacrifice.\"\r\n\r\nAsk the farmers of Poland and Denmark, of Czechoslovakia and\r\nFrance, looted of their livestock, starving while their own crops\r\nare stolen from their land, ask them whether \"parity\" prices are\r\ntoo great a \"sacrifice.\"\r\n\r\nAsk the businessmen of Europe, whose enterprises have been stolen\r\nfrom their owners, whether the limitation of profits and personal\r\nincomes is too great a \"sacrifice.\"\r\n\r\nAsk the women and children whom Hitler is starving whether the\r\nrationing of tires and gasoline and sugar is too great a\r\n\"sacrifice.\"\r\n\r\nWe do not have to ask them.  They have already given us their\r\nagonized answers.\r\n\r\nThis great war effort must be carried through to its victorious\r\nconclusion by the indomitable will and determination of the people\r\nas one great whole.\r\n\r\nIt must not be impeded by the faint of heart.\r\n\r\nIt must not be impeded by those who put their own selfish interests\r\nabove the interests of the nation.\r\n\r\nIt must not be impeded by those who pervert honest criticism into\r\nfalsification of fact.\r\n\r\nIt must not be impeded by self-styled experts either in economics\r\nor military problems who know neither true figures nor geography\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nIt must not be impeded by a few bogus patriots who use the sacred\r\nfreedom of the press to echo the sentiments of the propagandists in\r\nTokyo and Berlin.\r\n\r\nAnd, above all, it shall not be imperiled by the handful of noisy\r\ntraitors--betrayers of America, betrayers of Christianity itself--\r\nwould-be dictators who in their hearts and souls have yielded to\r\nHitlerism and would have this Republic do likewise.\r\n\r\nI shall use all of the executive power that I have to carry out the\r\npolicy laid down.  If it becomes necessary to ask for any additional\r\nlegislation in order to attain our objective of preventing a spiral\r\nin the cost of living, I shall do so.\r\n\r\nI know the American farmer, the American workman, and the American\r\nbusinessman.  I know that they will gladly embrace this economy and\r\nequality of sacrifice, satisfied that it is necessary for the most\r\nvital and compelling motive in all their lives--winning through to\r\nvictory.\r\n\r\nNever in the memory of man has there been a war in which the\r\ncourage, the endurance and the loyalty of civilians played so vital\r\na part.\r\n\r\nMany thousands of civilians all over the world have been and are\r\nbeing killed or maimed by enemy action.  Indeed, it was the\r\nfortitude of the common people of Britain under fire which enabled\r\nthat island to stand and prevented Hitler from winning the war in\r\n1940.  The ruins of London and Coventry and other cities are today\r\nthe proudest monuments to British heroism.\r\n\r\nOur own American civilian population is now relatively safe from\r\nsuch disasters.  And, to an ever-increasing extent, our soldiers,\r\nsailors and marines are fighting with great bravery and great skill\r\non far distant fronts to make sure that we shall remain safe.\r\n\r\nI should like to tell you one or two stories about the men we have\r\nin our armed forces:\r\n\r\nThere is, for example, Dr. Corydon M. Wassell.  He was a missionary,\r\nwell known for his good works in China.  He is a simple, modest,\r\nretiring man, nearly sixty years old, but he entered the service of\r\nhis country and was commissioned a Lieutenant Commander in the\r\nNavy.\r\n\r\nDr.  Wassell was assigned to duty in Java caring for wounded\r\nofficers and men of the cruisers HOUSTON and MARBLEHEAD which had\r\nbeen in heavy action in the Java seas.\r\n\r\nWhen the Japanese advanced across the island, it was decided to\r\nevacuate as many as possible of the wounded to Australia.  But about\r\ntwelve of the men were so badly wounded that they could not be\r\nmoved.  Dr. Wassell remained with these men, knowing that he would\r\nbe captured by the enemy.  But he decided to make a last desperate\r\nattempt to get the men out of Java.  He asked each of them if he\r\nwished to take the chance, and every one agreed.\r\n\r\nHe first had to get the twelve men to the sea coast--fifty miles\r\naway.  To do this, he had to improvise stretchers for the hazardous\r\njourney.  The men were suffering severely, but Dr. Wassell kept them\r\nalive by his skill, and inspired them by his own courage.\r\n\r\nAnd as the official report said, Dr. Wassell was \"almost like a\r\nChrist-like shepherd devoted to his flock.\"\r\n\r\nOn the sea coast, he embarked the men on a little Dutch ship.  They\r\nwere bombed, they were machine-gunned by waves of Japanese planes.\r\nDr.  Wassell took virtual command of the ship, and by great skill\r\navoided destruction, hiding in little bays and little inlets.\r\n\r\nA few days later, Dr. Wassell and his small flock of wounded men\r\nreached Australia safely.\r\n\r\nAnd today Dr. Wassell wears the Navy Cross.\r\n\r\nAnother story concerns a ship, a ship rather than an individual\r\nman.\r\n\r\nYou may remember the tragic sinking of the submarine, the U.S.S.\r\nSQUALUS off the New England coast in the summer of 1939.  Some of\r\nthe crew were lost, but others were saved by the speed and the\r\nefficiency of the surface rescue crews.  The SQUALUS itself was\r\ntediously raised from the bottom of the sea.\r\n\r\nShe was repaired and put back into commission, and eventually she\r\nsailed again under a new name, the U.S.S.  SAILFISH.  Today, she is a\r\npotent and effective unit of our submarine fleet in the Southwest\r\nPacific.\r\n\r\nThe SAILFISH has covered many thousands of miles in operations in\r\nthose waters.\r\n\r\nShe has sunk a Japanese destroyer.\r\n\r\nShe has torpedoed a Japanese cruiser.\r\n\r\nShe has made torpedo hits--two of them--on a Japanese aircraft\r\ncarrier.\r\n\r\nThree of the enlisted men of our Navy who went down with the\r\nSQUALUS in 1939 and were rescued, are today serving on the same\r\nship, the U.S.S.  SAILFISH, in this war.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that it is heartening to know that the SQUALUS, once\r\ngiven up as lost, rose from the depths to fight for our country in\r\ntime of peril.\r\n\r\nOne more story, that I heard only this morning:\r\n\r\nThis is a story of one of our Army Flying Fortresses operating in\r\nthe Western Pacific.  The pilot of this plane is a modest young man,\r\nproud of his crew for one of the toughest fights a bomber has yet\r\nexperienced.\r\n\r\nThe bomber departed from its base, as part or a flight of five\r\nbombers, to attack Japanese transports that were landing troops\r\nagainst us in the Philippines.  When they had gone about halfway to\r\ntheir destination, one of the motors of this bomber went out of\r\ncommission.  The young pilot lost contact with the other bombers.\r\nThe crew, however, got the motor working, got it going again and\r\nthe plane proceeded on its mission alone.\r\n\r\nBy the time it arrived at its target the other four Flying\r\nFortresses had already passed over, had dropped their bombs, and\r\nhad stirred up the hornets' nest of Japanese \"Zero\" planes.\r\nEighteen of these \"Zero\" fighters attacked our one Flying Fortress.\r\nDespite this mass attack, our plane proceeded on its mission, and\r\ndropped all of its bombs on six Japanese transports which were\r\nlined up along the docks.\r\n\r\nAs it turned back on its homeward journey a running fight between\r\nthe bomber and the eighteen Japanese pursuit planes continued for\r\n75 miles.  Four pursuit planes of the Japs attacked simultaneously\r\nat each side.  Four were shot down with the side guns.  During this\r\nfight, the bomber's radio operator was killed, the engineer's right\r\nhand was shot off, and one gunner was crippled, leaving only one\r\nman available to operate both side guns.  Although wounded in one\r\nhand, this gunner alternately manned both side guns, bringing down\r\nthree more Japanese \"Zero\" planes.  While this was going on, one\r\nengine on the American bomber was shot out, one gas tank was hit,\r\nthe radio was shot off, and the oxygen system was entirely\r\ndestroyed.  Out of eleven control cables all but four were shot\r\naway.  The rear landing wheel was blown off entirely, and the two\r\nfront wheels were both shot flat.\r\n\r\nThe fight continued until the remaining Japanese pursuit ships\r\nexhausted their ammunition and turned back.  With two engines gone\r\nand the plane practically out of control, the American bomber\r\nreturned to its base after dark and made an emergency landing.  The\r\nmission had been accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe name of that pilot is Captain Hewitt T. Wheless, of the United\r\nStates Army.  He comes from a place called Menard, Texas--with a\r\npopulation 2,375.  He has been awarded the Distinguished Service\r\nCross.  And I hope that he is listening.\r\n\r\nThese stories I have told you are not exceptional.  They are typical\r\nexamples of individual heroism and skill.\r\n\r\nAs we here at home contemplate our own duties, our own\r\nresponsibilities, let us think and think hard of the example which\r\nis being set for us by our fighting men.\r\n\r\nOur soldiers and sailors are members of well disciplined units.  But\r\nthey are still and forever individuals--free individuals.  They are\r\nfarmers, and workers, businessmen, professional men, artists,\r\nclerks.\r\n\r\nThey are the United States of America.\r\n\r\nThat is why they fight.\r\n\r\nWe too are the United States of America.\r\n\r\nThat is why we must work and sacrifice.\r\n\r\nIt is for them.  It is for us.  It is for victory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSeptember 7, 1942.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Friends:\r\n\r\nI wish that all the Americans people could read all the citations\r\nfor various medals recommended for our soldiers and sailors and\r\nmarines.  I am picking out one of these citations which tells of the\r\naccomplishments of Lieutenant John James Powers, United States\r\nNavy, during three days of the battles with Japanese forces in the\r\nCoral Sea.\r\n\r\nDuring the first two days, Lieutenant Powers, flying a dive-bomber\r\nin the face of blasting enemy anti-aircraft fire, demolished one\r\nlarge enemy gunboat, put another gunboat out of commission,\r\nseverely damaged an aircraft tender and a twenty-thousand-ton\r\ntransport, and scored a direct hit on an aircraft carrier which\r\nburst into flames and sank soon after.\r\n\r\nThe official citation then describes the morning of the third day\r\nof battle.  As the pilots of his squadron left the ready room to man\r\ntheir planes, Lieutenant Powers said to them, \"Remember, the folks\r\nback home are counting on us.  I am going to get a hit if I have to\r\nlay it on their flight deck.\r\n\r\nHe led his section down to the target from an altitude of 18,000\r\nfeet, through a wall of bursting anti-aircraft shells and swarms of\r\nenemy planes.  He dived almost to the very deck of the enemy\r\ncarrier, and did not release his bomb until he was sure of a direct\r\nhit.  He was last seen attempting recovery from his dive at the\r\nextremely low altitude of two hundred feet, amid a terrific barrage\r\nof shell and bomb fragments, and smoke and flame and debris from\r\nthe stricken vessel.  His own plane was destroyed by the explosion\r\nof his own bomb.  But he had made good his promise to \"lay it on\r\ntheir flight deck.\"\r\n\r\nI have received a recommendation from the Secretary of the Navy\r\nthat Lieutenant John James Powers of New York City, missing in\r\naction, be awarded the Medal of Honor.  I hereby and now make this\r\naward.\r\n\r\nYou and I are \"the folks back home\" for whose protection Lieutenant\r\nPowers fought and repeatedly risked his life.  He said that we\r\ncounted on him and his men.  We did not count in vain.  But have not\r\nthose men a right to be counting on us?  How are we playing our part\r\n\"back home\" in winning this war?\r\n\r\nThe answer is that we are not doing enough.\r\n\r\nToday I sent a message to the Congress, pointing out the\r\noverwhelming urgency of the serious domestic economic crisis with\r\nwhich we are threatened.  Some call it \"inflation,\" which is a vague\r\nsort of term, and others call it a \"rise in the cost of living,\"\r\nwhich is much more easily understood by most families.\r\n\r\nThat phrase, \"the cost of living,\" means essentially what a dollar\r\ncan buy.\r\n\r\nFrom January 1, 1941, to May of this year, nearly a year and a\r\nhalf, the cost of living went up about 15 percent.  And at that\r\npoint last May we undertook to freeze the cost of living.  But we\r\ncould not do a complete job of it, because the Congressional\r\nauthority at the time exempted a large part of farm products used\r\nfor food and for making clothing, although several weeks before, I\r\nhad asked the Congress for legislation to stabilize all farm\r\nprices.\r\n\r\nAt that time I had told the Congress that there were seven elements\r\nin our national economy, all of which had to be controlled; and\r\nthat if any one essential element remained exempt, the cost of\r\nliving could not be held down.\r\n\r\nOn only two of these points--both of them vital however--did I call\r\nfor Congressional action.  These two vital points were:  First,\r\ntaxation; and, second, the stabilization of all farm prices at\r\nparity.\r\n\r\n\"Parity\" is a standard for the maintenance of good farm prices.  It\r\nwas established as our national policy way back in 1933.  It means\r\nthat the farmer and the city worker are on the same relative ratio\r\nwith each other in purchasing power as they were during a period\r\nsome thirty years before--at a time then the farmer had a\r\nsatisfactory purchasing power.  One hundred percent of parity,\r\ntherefore, has been accepted by farmers as the fair standard for\r\nthe prices they receive.\r\n\r\nLast January, however, the Congress passed a law forbidding\r\nceilings on farm prices below 110 percent of parity on some\r\ncommodities.  And on other commodities the ceiling was even higher,\r\nso that the average possible ceiling is now about 116 percent of\r\nparity for agricultural products as a whole.\r\n\r\nThis act of favoritism for one particular group in the community\r\nincreased the cost of food to everybody--not only to the workers in\r\nthe city or in the munitions plants, and their families, but also\r\nto the families of the farmers themselves.\r\n\r\nSince last May, ceilings have been set on nearly all commodities,\r\nrents services, except the exempted farm products.  Installment\r\nbuying, for example, has been effectively controlled.\r\n\r\nWages in certain key industries have been stabilized on the basis\r\nof the present cost of living.\r\n\r\nBut it is obvious to all of us that if the cost of food continues\r\nto go up, as it is doing at present, the wage earner, particularly\r\nin the lower brackets, will have a right to an increase in his\r\nwages.  I think that would be essential justice and a practical\r\nnecessity.\r\n\r\nOur experience with the control of other prices during the past few\r\nmonths has brought out one important fact--the rising cost of\r\nliving can be controlled, providing that all elements making up the\r\ncost of living are controlled at the same time.  I think that also\r\nis an essential justice and a practical necessity.  We know that\r\nparity prices for farm products not now controlled will not put up\r\nthe cost of living more than a very small amount; but we also know\r\nthat if we must go up to an average of 116 percent of parity for\r\nfood and other farm products--which is necessary at present under\r\nthe Emergency Price Control Act before we can control all farm\r\nprices--the cost of living will get well out of hand.  We are face\r\nto face with this danger today.  Let us meet it and remove it.\r\n\r\nI realize that it may seem out of proportion to you to be over-\r\nstressing these economic problems at a time like this, when we are\r\nall deeply concerned about the news from far distant fields of\r\nbattle.  But I give you the solemn assurance that failure to solve\r\nthis problem here at home--and to solve it now--will make more\r\ndifficult the winning of this war.\r\n\r\nIf the vicious spiral of inflation ever gets under way, the whole\r\neconomic system will stagger.  Prices and wages will go up so\r\nrapidly that the entire production program will be endangered.  The\r\ncost of the war, paid by taxpayers, will jump beyond all present\r\ncalculations.  It will mean an uncontrollable rise in prices and in\r\nwages, which can result in raising the overall cost of living as\r\nhigh as another 20 percent soon.  That would mean that the\r\npurchasing power of every dollar that you have in your pay\r\nenvelope, or in the bank, or included in your insurance policy or\r\nyour pension, would be reduced to about eighty centsą worth.  I need\r\nnot tell you that this would have a demoralizing effect on our\r\npeople, soldiers and civilians alike.\r\n\r\nOverall stabilization of prices, and salaries, wages and profits is\r\nnecessary to the continued increasing production of planes and\r\ntanks and ships and guns.\r\n\r\nIn my message to Congress today, I have said that this must be done\r\nquickly.  If we wait for two or three or four or six months it may\r\nwell be too late.\r\n\r\nI have told the Congress that the administration cannot hold the\r\nactual cost of food and clothing down to the present level beyond\r\nOctober first.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I have asked the Congress to pass legislation under\r\nwhich the President would be specifically authorized to stabilize\r\nthe cost of living, including the price of all farm commodities.\r\nThe purpose should be to hold farm prices at parity, or at levels\r\nof a recent date, whichever is higher.  The purpose should also be\r\nto keep wages at a point stabilized with today's cost of living.\r\nBoth must be regulated at the same time; and neither one of them\r\ncan or should be regulated without the other.\r\n\r\nAt the same time that farm prices are stabilized, I will stabilize\r\nwages.\r\n\r\nThat is plain justice--and plain common sense.\r\n\r\nAnd so I have asked the Congress to take this action by the first\r\nof October.  We must now act with the dispatch which the stern\r\nnecessities of war require.\r\n\r\nI have told the Congress that inaction on their part by that date\r\nwill leave me with an inescapable responsibility, a responsibility\r\nto the people of this country to see to it that the war effort is\r\nno longer imperiled by the threat of economic chaos.\r\n\r\nAs I said in my message to the Congress:\r\n\r\nIn the event that the Congress should fail to act, and act\r\nadequately, I shall accept the responsibility, and I will act.\r\n\r\nThe President has the powers, under the Constitution and under\r\nCongressional Acts, to take measures necessary to avert a disaster\r\nwhich would interfere with the winning of the war.\r\n\r\nI have given the most careful and thoughtful consideration to\r\nmeeting this issue without further reference to the Congress.  I\r\nhave determined, however, on this vital matter to consult with the\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nThere may be those who will say that, if the situation is as grave\r\nas I have stated it to be, I should use my powers and act now.  I\r\ncan only say that I have approached this problem from every angle,\r\nand that I have decided that the course of conduct which I am\r\nfollowing in this case is consistent with my sense of\r\nresponsibility as President in time of war, and with my deep and\r\nunalterable devotion to the processes of democracy.\r\n\r\nThe responsibilities of the President in wartime to protect the\r\nnation are very grave.  This total war, with our fighting fronts all\r\nover the world, makes the use of the executive power far more\r\nessential than in any previous war.\r\n\r\nIf we were invaded, the people of this country would expect the\r\nPresident to use any and all means to repel the invader.\r\n\r\nNow the revolution and the war between the states were fought on\r\nour own soil, but today this war will be won or lost on other\r\ncontinents and in remote seas.  I cannot tell what powers may have\r\nto be exercised in order to win this war.\r\n\r\nThe American people can be sure that I will use my powers with a\r\nfull sense of responsibility to the Constitution and to my country.\r\nThe American people can also be sure that I shall not hesitate to\r\nuse every power vested in me to accomplish the defeat of our\r\nenemies in any part of the world where our own safety demands such\r\ndefeat.\r\n\r\nAnd when the war is over, the powers under which I act will\r\nautomatically revert to the people of the United States--to the\r\npeople to whom those powers belong.\r\n\r\nI think I know the American farmers.  I know they are as\r\nwholehearted in their patriotism as any other group.  They have\r\nsuffered from the constant fluctuations of farm prices--\r\noccasionally too high, more often too low.  Nobody knows better than\r\nfarmers the disastrous effects of wartime inflationary booms, and\r\npostwar deflationary panics.\r\n\r\nSo I have also suggested today that the Congress make our\r\nagricultural economy more stable.  I have recommended that in\r\naddition to putting ceilings on all farm products now, we also\r\nplace a definite floor under those prices for a period beginning\r\nnow, continuing through the war, and for as long as necessary after\r\nthe war.  In this way we will be able to avoid the collapse of farm\r\nprices that happened after the last war.  The farmers must be\r\nassured of a fair minimum price during the readjustment period\r\nwhich will follow the great, excessive world food demands which now\r\nprevail.\r\n\r\nWe must have some floor under farm prices, as we must have under\r\nwages, if we are to avoid the dangers of a postwar inflation on the\r\none hand, or the catastrophe of a crash in farm prices and wages on\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nToday I have also advised the Congress of the importance of\r\nspeeding up the passage of the tax bill.  The federal treasury is\r\nlosing millions of dollars each and every day because the bill has\r\nnot yet been passed.  Taxation is the only practical way of\r\npreventing the incomes and profits of individuals and corporations\r\nfrom getting too high.\r\n\r\nI have told the Congress once more that all net individual incomes,\r\nafter payment of all taxes, should be limited effectively by\r\nfurther taxation to a maximum net income of $25,000 a year.  And it\r\nis equally important that corporate profits should not exceed a\r\nreasonable amount in any case.\r\n\r\nThe nation must have more money to run the war.  People must stop\r\nspending for luxuries.  Our country needs a far greater share of our\r\nincomes.\r\n\r\nFor this is a global war, and it will cost this nation nearly one\r\nhundred billion dollars in 1943.\r\n\r\nIn that global war there are now four main areas of combat; and I\r\nshould like to speak briefly of them, not in the order of their\r\nimportance, for all of them are vital and all of them are\r\ninterrelated.\r\n\r\n1.  The Russian front.  Here the Germans are still unable to gain the\r\nsmashing victory which, almost a year ago, Hitler announced he had\r\nalready achieved.  Germany has been able to capture important\r\nRussian territory.  Nevertheless, Hitler has been unable to destroy\r\na single Russian Army; and this, you may be sure, has been, and\r\nstill is, his main objective.  Millions of German troops seem doomed\r\nto spend another cruel and bitter winter on the Russian front.  Yes,\r\nthe Russians are killing more Nazis, and destroying more airplanes\r\nand tanks than are being smashed on any other front.  They are\r\nfighting not only bravely but brilliantly.  In spite of any setbacks\r\nRussia will hold out, and with the help of her Allies will\r\nultimately drive every Nazi from her soil.\r\n\r\n2.  The Pacific Ocean Area.  This area must be grouped together as a\r\nwhole--every part of it, land and sea.  We have stopped one major\r\nJapanese offensive; and we have inflicted heavy losses on their\r\nfleet.  But they still possess great strength; they seek to keep the\r\ninitiative; and they will undoubtedly strike hard again.  We must\r\nnot overrate the importance of our successes in the Solomon\r\nIslands, though we may be proud of the skill with which these local\r\noperations were conducted.  At the same time, we need not underrate\r\nthe significance of our victory at Midway.  There we stopped the\r\nmajor Japanese offensive.\r\n\r\n3.  In the Mediterranean and the Middle East area the British,\r\ntogether with the South Africans, Australians, New Zealanders,\r\nIndian troops and others of the United Nations, including\r\nourselves, are fighting a desperate battle with the Germans and\r\nItalians.  The Axis powers are fighting to gain control of that\r\narea, dominate the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean, and gain\r\ncontact with the Japanese Navy.  The battle in the Middle East is\r\nnow joined.  We are well aware of our danger, but we are hopeful of\r\nthe outcome.\r\n\r\n4.  The European area.  Here the aim is an offensive against Germany.\r\nThere are at least a dozen different points at which attacks can be\r\nlaunched.  You, of course, do not expect me to give details of\r\nfuture plans, but you can rest assured that preparations are being\r\nmade here and in Britain toward this purpose.  The power of Germany\r\nmust be broken on the battlefields of Europe.\r\n\r\nVarious people urge that we concentrate our forces on one or\r\nanother of these four areas, although no one suggests that any one\r\nof the four areas should be abandoned.  Certainly, it could not be\r\nseriously urged that we abandon aid to Russia, or that we surrender\r\nall of the Pacific to Japan, or the Mediterranean and Middle East\r\nto Germany, or give up an offensive against Germany.  The American\r\npeople may be sure that we shall neglect none of the four great\r\ntheaters of war.\r\n\r\nCertain vital military decisions have been made.  In due time you\r\nwill know what these decisions are--and so will our enemies.  I can\r\nsay now that all of these decisions are directed toward taking the\r\noffensive.\r\n\r\nToday, exactly nine months after Pearl Harbor, we have sent\r\noverseas three times more men than we transported to France in the\r\nfirst nine months of the first World War.  We have done this in\r\nspite of greater danger and fewer ships.  And every week sees a gain\r\nin the actual number of American men and weapons in the fighting\r\nareas.  These reinforcements in men and munitions are continuing,\r\nand will continue to go forward.\r\n\r\nThis war will finally be won by the coordination of all the armies,\r\nnavies and air forces of all of the United Nations operating in\r\nunison against our enemies.\r\n\r\nThis will require vast assemblies of weapons and men at all the\r\nvital points of attack.  We and our allies have worked for years to\r\nachieve superiority in weapons.  We have no doubts about the\r\nsuperiority of our men.  We glory in the individual exploits of our\r\nsoldiers, our sailors, our marines, our merchant seamen.  Lieutenant\r\nJohn James Powers was one of these--and there are thousands of\r\nothers in the forces of the United Nations.\r\n\r\nSeveral thousand Americans have met death in battle.  Other\r\nthousands will lose their lives.  But many millions stand ready to\r\nstep into their places--to engage in a struggle to the very death.\r\nFor they know that the enemy is determined to destroy us, our homes\r\nand our institutions--that in this war it is kill or be killed.\r\n\r\nBattles are not won by soldiers or sailors who think first of their\r\nown personal safety.  And wars are not won by people who are\r\nconcerned primarily with their own comfort, their own convenience,\r\ntheir own pocketbooks.\r\n\r\nWe Americans of today bear the gravest of responsibilities.  And all\r\nof the United Nations share them.\r\n\r\nAll of us here at home are being tested--for our fortitude, for our\r\nselfless devotion to our country and to our cause.\r\n\r\nThis is the toughest war of all time.  We need not leave it to\r\nhistorians of the future to answer the question whether we are\r\ntough enough to meet this unprecedented challenge.  We can give that\r\nanswer now.  The answer is \"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOctober 12, 1942.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Fellow Americans:\r\n\r\nAs you know, I have recently come back from a trip of inspection of\r\ncamps and training stations and war factories.\r\n\r\nThe main thing that I observed on this trip is not exactly news.  It\r\nis the plain fact that the American people are united as never\r\nbefore in their determination to do a job and to do it well.\r\n\r\nThis whole nation of 130,000,000 free men, women and children is\r\nbecoming one great fighting force.  Some of us are soldiers or\r\nsailors, some of us are civilians.  Some of us are fighting the war\r\nin airplanes five miles above the continent of Europe or the\r\nislands of the Pacific--and some of us are fighting it in mines\r\ndeep down in the earth of Pennsylvania or Montana.  A few of us are\r\ndecorated with medals for heroic achievement, but all of us can\r\nhave that deep and permanent inner satisfaction that comes from\r\ndoing the best we know how--each of us playing an honorable part in\r\nthe great struggle to save our democratic civilization.\r\n\r\nWhatever our individual circumstances or opportunities--we are all\r\nin it, and our spirit is good, and we Americans and our allies are\r\ngoing to win--and do not let anyone tell you anything different.\r\n\r\nThat is the main thing that I saw on my trip around the country--\r\nunbeatable spirit.  If the leaders of Germany and Japan could have\r\ncome along with me, and had seen what I saw, they would agree with\r\nmy conclusions.  Unfortunately, they were unable to make the trip\r\nwith me.  And that is one reason why we are carrying our war effort\r\noverseas--to them.\r\n\r\nWith every passing week the war increases in scope and intensity.\r\nThat is true in Europe, in Africa, in Asia, and on all the seas.\r\n\r\nThe strength of the United Nations is on the upgrade in this war.\r\nThe Axis leaders, on the other hand, know by now that they have\r\nalready reached their full strength, and that their steadily\r\nmounting losses in men and material cannot be fully replaced.\r\nGermany and Japan are already realizing what the inevitable result\r\nwill be when the total strength of the United Nations hits them--at\r\nadditional places on the earth's surface.\r\n\r\nOne of the principal weapons of our enemies in the past has been\r\ntheir use of what is called \"The War of Nerves.\"  They have spread\r\nfalsehood and terror; they have started Fifth Columns everywhere;\r\nthey have duped the innocent; they have fomented suspicion and hate\r\nbetween neighbors; they have aided and abetted those people in\r\nother nations--including our own--whose words and deeds are\r\nadvertised from Berlin and from Tokyo as proof of our disunity.\r\n\r\nThe greatest defense against all such propaganda, of course, is the\r\ncommon sense of the common people--and that defense is prevailing.\r\n\r\nThe \"War of Nerves\" against the United Nations is now turning into\r\na boomerang.  For the first time, the Nazi propaganda machine is on\r\nthe defensive.  They begin to apologize to their own people for the\r\nrepulse of their vast forces at Stalingrad, and for the enormous\r\ncasualties they are suffering.  They are compelled to beg their\r\noverworked people to rally their weakened production.  They even\r\npublicly admit, for the first time, that Germany can be fed only at\r\nthe cost of stealing food from the rest of Europe.\r\n\r\nThey are proclaiming that a second front is impossible; but, at the\r\nsame time, they are desperately rushing troops in all directions,\r\nand stringing barbed wire all the way from the coasts of Finland\r\nand Norway to the islands of the Eastern Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, they are driven to increase the fury of their\r\natrocities.\r\n\r\nThe United Nations have decided to establish the identity of those\r\nNazi leaders who are responsible for the innumerable acts of\r\nsavagery.  As each of these criminal deeds is committed, it is being\r\ncarefully investigated; and the evidence is being relentlessly\r\npiled up for the future purposes of justice.\r\n\r\nWe have made it entirely clear that the United Nations seek no mass\r\nreprisals against the populations of Germany or Italy or Japan.  But\r\nthe ring leaders and their brutal henchmen must be named, and\r\napprehended, and tried in accordance with the judicial processes of\r\ncriminal law.\r\n\r\nThere are now millions of Americans in army camps, in naval\r\nstations, in factories and in shipyards.\r\n\r\nWho are these millions upon whom the life of our country depends?\r\nWhat are they thinking?  What are their doubts?  What are their\r\nhopes?  And how is the work progressing?\r\n\r\nThe Commander-in-Chief cannot learn all of the answers to these\r\nquestions in Washington.  And that is why I made the trip I did.\r\n\r\nIt is very easy to say, as some have said, that when the President\r\ntravels through the country he should go with a blare of trumpets,\r\nwith crowds on the sidewalks, with batteries of reporters and\r\nphotographers--talking and posing with all of the politicians of\r\nthe land.\r\n\r\nBut having had some experience in this war and in the last war, I\r\ncan tell you very simply that the kind of trip I took permitted me\r\nto concentrate on the work I had to do without expending time,\r\nmeeting all the demands of publicity.  And--I might add--it was a\r\nparticular pleasure to make a tour of the country without having to\r\ngive a single thought to politics.\r\n\r\nI expect to make other trips for similar purposes, and I shall make\r\nthem in the same way.\r\n\r\nIn the last war, I had seen great factories; but until I saw some\r\nof the new present-day plants, I had not thoroughly visualized our\r\nAmerican war effort.  Of course, I saw only a small portion of all\r\nour plants, but that portion was a good cross-section, and it was\r\ndeeply impressive.\r\n\r\nThe United States has been at war for only ten months, and is\r\nengaged in the enormous task of multiplying its armed forces many\r\ntimes.  We are by no means at full production level yet.  But I could\r\nnot help asking myself on the trip, where would we be today if the\r\ngovernment of the United States had not begun to build many of its\r\nfactories for this huge increase more than two years ago, more than\r\na year before war was forced upon us at Pearl Harbor?\r\n\r\nWe have also had to face the problem of shipping.  Ships in every\r\npart of the world continue to be sunk by enemy action.  But the\r\ntotal tonnage of ships coming out of American, Canadian and British\r\nshipyards, day by day, has increased so fast that we are getting\r\nahead of our enemies in the bitter battle of transportation.\r\n\r\nIn expanding our shipping, we have had to enlist many thousands of\r\nmen for our Merchant Marine.  These men are serving magnificently.\r\nThey are risking their lives every hour so that guns and tanks and\r\nplanes and ammunition and food may be carried to the heroic\r\ndefenders of Stalingrad and to all the United Nations' forces all\r\nover the world.\r\n\r\nA few days ago I awarded the first Maritime Distinguished Service\r\nMedal to a young man--Edward F. Cheney of Yeadon, Pennsylvania--who\r\nhad shown great gallantry in rescuing his comrades from the oily\r\nwaters of the sea after their ship had been torpedoed.  There will\r\nbe many more such acts of bravery.\r\n\r\nIn one sense my recent trip was a hurried one, out through the\r\nMiddle West, to the Northwest, down the length of the Pacific Coast\r\nand back through the Southwest and the South.  In another sense,\r\nhowever, it was a leisurely trip, because I had the opportunity to\r\ntalk to the people who are actually doing the work--management and\r\nlabor alike--on their own home grounds.  And it gave me a fine\r\nchance to do some thinking about the major problems of our war\r\neffort on the basis of first things first.\r\n\r\nAs I told the three press association representatives who\r\naccompanied me, I was impressed by the large proportion of women\r\nemployed--doing skilled manual labor running machines.  As time goes\r\non, and many more of our men enter the armed forces, this\r\nproportion of women will increase.  Within less than a year from\r\nnow, I think, there will probably be as many women as men working\r\nin our war production plants.\r\n\r\nI had some enlightening experiences relating to the old saying of\r\nus men that curiosity--inquisitiveness--is stronger among woman.  I\r\nnoticed, frequently, that when we drove unannounced down the middle\r\naisle of a great plant full of workers and machines, the first\r\npeople to look up from their work were the men--and not the women.\r\nIt was chiefly the men who were arguing as to whether that fellow\r\nin the straw hat was really the President or not.\r\n\r\nSo having seen the quality of the work and of the workers on our\r\nproduction lines--and coupling these firsthand observations with\r\nthe reports of actual performance of our weapons on the fighting\r\nfronts--I can say to you that we are getting ahead of our enemies\r\nin the battle of production.\r\n\r\nAnd of great importance to our future production was the effective\r\nand rapid manner in which the Congress met the serious problem of\r\nthe rising cost of living.  It was a splendid example of the\r\noperation of democratic processes in wartime.\r\n\r\nThe machinery to carry out this act of the Congress was put into\r\neffect within twelve hours after the bill was signed.  The\r\nlegislation will help the cost-of-living problems of every worker\r\nin every factory and on every farm in the land.\r\n\r\nIn order to keep stepping up our production, we have had to add\r\nmillions of workers to the total labor force of the nation.  And as\r\nnew factories came into operation, we must find additional millions\r\nof workers.\r\n\r\nThis presents a formidable problem in the mobilization of manpower.\r\n\r\nIt is not that we do not have enough people in this country to do\r\nthe job.  The problem is to have the right numbers of the right\r\npeople in the right places at the right time.\r\n\r\nWe are learning to ration materials, and we must now learn to\r\nration manpower.  The major objectives of a sound manpower policy\r\nare:\r\n\r\nFirst, to select and train men of the highest fighting efficiency\r\nneeded for our armed forces in the achievement of victory over our\r\nenemies in combat.\r\n\r\nSecond, to man our war industries and farms with the workers needed\r\nto produce the arms and munitions and food required by ourselves\r\nand by our fighting allies to win this war.\r\n\r\nIn order to do this, we shall be compelled to stop workers from\r\nmoving from one war job to another as a matter of personal\r\npreference; to stop employers from stealing labor from each other;\r\nto use older men, and handicapped people, and more women, and even\r\ngrown boys and girls, wherever possible and reasonable, to replace\r\nmen of military age and fitness; to train new personnel for\r\nessential war work; and to stop the wastage of labor in all non-\r\nessential activities.\r\n\r\nThere are many other things that we can do, and do immediately, to\r\nhelp meet this manpower problem.\r\n\r\nThe school authorities in all the states should work out plans to\r\nenable our high school students to take some time from their school\r\nyear, and to use their summer vacations, to help farmers raise and\r\nharvest their crops, or to work somewhere in the war industries.\r\nThis does not mean closing schools and stopping education.  It does\r\nmean giving older students a better opportunity to contribute their\r\nbit to the war effort.  Such work will do no harm to the students.\r\n\r\nPeople should do their work as near their homes as possible.  We\r\ncannot afford to transport a single worker into an area where there\r\nis already a worker available to do the job.\r\n\r\nIn some communities, employers dislike to employ women.  In others\r\nthey are reluctant to hire Negroes.  In still others, older men are\r\nnot wanted.  We can no longer afford to indulge such prejudices or\r\npractices.\r\n\r\nEvery citizen wants to know what essential war work he can do the\r\nbest.  He can get the answer by applying to the nearest United\r\nStates Employment Service office.  There are four thousand five\r\nhundred of these offices throughout the nation.  They form the\r\ncorner grocery stores of our manpower system.  This network of\r\nemployment offices is prepared to advise every citizen where his\r\nskills and labors are needed most, and to refer him to an employer\r\nwho can utilize them to best advantage in the war effort.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most difficult phase of the manpower problem is the\r\nscarcity of farm labor in many places.  I have seen evidences of the\r\nfact, however, that the people are trying to meet it as well as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nIn one community that I visited a perishable crop was harvested by\r\nturning out the whole of the high school for three or four days.\r\n\r\nAnd in another community of fruit growers the usual Japanese labor\r\nwas not available; but when the fruit ripened, the banker, the\r\nbutcher, the lawyer, the garage man, the druggist, the local\r\neditor, and in fact every able-bodied man and woman in the town,\r\nleft their occupations and went out, gathered the fruit, and sent\r\nit to market.\r\n\r\nEvery farmer in the land must realize fully that his production is\r\npart of war production, and that he is regarded by the nation as\r\nessential to victory.  The American people expect him to keep his\r\nproduction up, and even to increase it.  We will use every effort to\r\nhelp him to get labor; but, at the same time, he and the people of\r\nhis community must use ingenuity and cooperative effort to produce\r\ncrops, and livestock and dairy products.\r\n\r\nIt may be that all of our volunteer effort--however well\r\nintentioned and well administered--will not suffice wholly to solve\r\nthis problem.  In that case, we shall have to adopt new legislation.\r\nAnd if this is necessary, I do not believe that the American people\r\nwill shrink from it.\r\n\r\nIn a sense, every American, because of the privilege of his\r\ncitizenship, is a part of the Selective Service.\r\n\r\nThe Nation owes a debt of gratitude to the Selective Service\r\nboards.  The successful operation of the Selective Service System\r\nand the way it has been accepted by the great mass of our citizens\r\ngive us confidence that if necessary, the same principle could be\r\nused to solve any manpower problem.\r\n\r\nAnd I want to say also a word of praise and thanks to the more than\r\nten million people, all over the country, who have volunteered for\r\nthe work of civilian defense--and who are working hard at it.  They\r\nare displaying unselfish devotion in the patient performance of\r\ntheir often tiresome and always anonymous tasks.  In doing this\r\nimportant neighborly work they are helping to fortify our national\r\nunity and our real understanding of the fact that we are all\r\ninvolved in this war.\r\n\r\nNaturally, on my trip I was most interested in watching the\r\ntraining of our fighting forces.\r\n\r\nAll of our combat units that go overseas must consist of young,\r\nstrong men who have had thorough training.  An Army division that\r\nhas an average age of twenty-three or twenty-four is a better\r\nfighting unit than one which has an average age of thirty-three or\r\nthirty-four.  The more of such troops we have in the field, the\r\nsooner the war will be won, and the smaller will be the cost in\r\ncasualties.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I believe that it will be necessary to lower the present\r\nminimum age limit for Selective Service from twenty years down to\r\neighteen.  We have learned how inevitable that is--and how important\r\nto the speeding up of victory.\r\n\r\nI can very thoroughly understand the feelings of all parents whose\r\nsons have entered our armed forces.  I have an appreciation of that\r\nfeeling and so has my wife.\r\n\r\nI want every father and every mother who has a son in the service\r\nto know--again, from what I have seen with my own eyes--that the\r\nmen in the Army, Navy and Marine Corps are receiving today the best\r\npossible training, equipment and medical care.  And we will never\r\nfail to provide for the spiritual needs of our officers and men\r\nunder the Chaplains of our armed services.\r\n\r\nGood training will save many, many lives in battle.  The highest\r\nrate of casualties is always suffered by units comprised of\r\ninadequately trained men.\r\n\r\nWe can be sure that the combat units of our Army and Navy are well\r\nmanned, well equipped, and well trained.  Their effectiveness in\r\naction will depend upon the quality of their leadership, and upon\r\nthe wisdom of the strategic plans on which all military operations\r\nare based.\r\n\r\nI can say one thing about these plans of ours:  They are not being\r\ndecided by the typewriter strategists who expound their views on\r\nthe radio or in the press.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest of American soldiers, Robert E. Lee, once\r\nremarked on the tragic fact that in the war of his day all of the\r\nbest generals were apparently working on newspapers instead of in\r\nthe Army.  And that seems to be true in all wars.\r\n\r\nThe trouble with the typewriter strategists is that while they may\r\nbe full of bright ideas, they are not in possession of much\r\ninformation about the facts or problems of military operations.\r\n\r\nWe, therefore, will continue to leave the plans for this war to the\r\nmilitary leaders.\r\n\r\nThe military and naval plans of the United States are made by the\r\nJoint Staff of the Army and Navy which is constantly in session in\r\nWashington.  The Chiefs of this Staff are Admiral Leahy, General\r\nMarshall, Admiral King and General Arnold.  They meet and confer\r\nregularly with representatives of the British Joint Staff, and with\r\nrepresentatives of Russia, China, the Netherlands, Poland, Norway,\r\nthe British Dominions and other nations working in the common\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nSince this unity of operations was put into effect last January,\r\nthere has been a very substantial agreement between these planners,\r\nall of whom are trained in the profession of arms--air, sea and\r\nland--from their early years.  As Commander-in-Chief I have at all\r\ntimes also been in substantial agreement.\r\n\r\nAs I have said before, many major decisions of strategy have been\r\nmade.  One of them--on which we have all agreed--relates to the\r\nnecessity of diverting enemy forces from Russia and China to other\r\ntheaters of war by new offensives against Germany and Japan.  An\r\nannouncement of how these offensives are to be launched, and when,\r\nand where, cannot be broadcast over the radio at this time.\r\n\r\nWe are celebrating today the exploit of a bold and adventurous\r\nItalian--Christopher Columbus--who with the aid of Spain opened up\r\na new world where freedom and tolerance and respect for human\r\nrights and dignity provided an asylum for the oppressed of the Old\r\nWorld.\r\n\r\nToday, the sons of the New World are fighting in lands far distant\r\nfrom their own America.  They are fighting to save for all mankind,\r\nincluding ourselves, the principles which have flourished in this\r\nnew world of freedom.\r\n\r\nWe are mindful of the countless millions of people whose future\r\nliberty and whose very lives depend upon permanent victory for the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\n\r\nThere are a few people in this country who, when the collapse of\r\nthe Axis begins, will tell our people that we are safe once more;\r\nthat we can tell the rest of the world to \"stew in its own juice\";\r\nthat never again will we help to pull \"the other fellow's chestnuts\r\nfrom the fire\"; that the future of civilization can jolly well take\r\ncare of itself insofar as we are concerned.\r\n\r\nBut it is useless to win battles if the cause for which we fight\r\nthese battles is lost.  It is useless to win a war unless it stays\r\nwon.\r\n\r\nWe, therefore, fight for the restoration and perpetuation of faith\r\nand hope and peace throughout the world.\r\n\r\nThe objective of today is clear and realistic.  It is to destroy\r\ncompletely the military power of Germany, Italy and Japan to such\r\ngood purpose that their threat against us and all the other United\r\nNations cannot be revived a generation hence.\r\n\r\nWe are united in seeking the kind of victory that will guarantee\r\nthat our grandchildren can grow and, under God, may live their\r\nlives, free from the constant threat of invasion, destruction,\r\nslavery and violent death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMay 2, 1943.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Fellow Americans:\r\n\r\nI am speaking tonight to the American people, and in particular to\r\nthose of our citizens who are coal miners.\r\n\r\nTonight this country faces a serious crisis.  We are engaged in a\r\nwar on the successful outcome of which will depend the whole future\r\nof our country.\r\n\r\nThis war has reached a new critical phase.  After the years that we\r\nhave spent in preparation, we have moved into active and continuing\r\nbattle with our enemies.  We are pouring into the world-wide\r\nconflict everything that we have--our young men, and the vast\r\nresources of our nation.\r\n\r\nI have just returned from a two weeks' tour of inspection on which\r\nI saw our men being trained and our war materials made.  My trip\r\ntook me through twenty states.  I saw thousands of workers on the\r\nproduction line, making airplanes, and guns and ammunition.\r\n\r\nEverywhere I found great eagerness to get on with the war.  Men and\r\nwomen are working long hours at difficult jobs and living under\r\ndifficult conditions without complaint.\r\n\r\nAlong thousands of miles of track I saw countless acres of newly\r\nploughed fields.  The farmers of this country are planting the crops\r\nthat are needed to feed our armed forces, our civilian population\r\nand our Allies.  Those crops will be harvested.\r\n\r\nOn my trip, I saw hundreds of thousands of soldiers.  Young men who\r\nwere green recruits last autumn have matured into self-assured and\r\nhardened fighting men.  They are in splendid physical condition.\r\nThey are mastering the superior weapons that we are pouring out of\r\nour factories.\r\n\r\nThe American people have accomplished a miracle.\r\n\r\nHowever, all of our massed effort is none too great to meet the\r\ndemands of this war.  We shall need everything that we have and\r\neverything that our Allies have to defeat the Nazis and the\r\nFascists in the coming battles on the continent of Europe, and the\r\nJapanese on the continent of Asia and in the islands of the\r\nPacific.\r\n\r\nThis tremendous forward movement of the United States and the\r\nUnited Nations cannot be stopped by our enemies.\r\n\r\nAnd equally, it must not be hampered by any one individual or by\r\nthe leaders of any one group here back home.\r\n\r\nI want to make it clear that every American coal miner who has\r\nstopped mining coal--no matter how sincere his motives, no matter\r\nhow legitimate he may believe his grievances to be--every idle\r\nminer directly and individually is obstructing our war effort.  We\r\nhave not yet won this war.  We will win this war only as we produce\r\nand deliver our total American effort on the high seas and on the\r\nbattle fronts.  And that requires unrelenting, uninterrupted effort\r\nhere on the home front.\r\n\r\nA stopping of the coal supply, even for a short time, would involve\r\na gamble with the lives of American soldiers and sailors and the\r\nfuture security of our whole people.  It would involve an\r\nunwarranted, unnecessary and terribly dangerous gamble with our\r\nchances for victory.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I say to all miners--and to all Americans everywhere, at\r\nhome and abroad--the production of coal will not be stopped.\r\n\r\nTonight, I am speaking to the essential patriotism of the miners,\r\nand to the patriotism of their wives and children.  And I am going\r\nto state the true facts of this case as simply and as plainly as I\r\nknow how.\r\n\r\nAfter the attack at Pearl Harbor, the three great labor\r\norganizations--the American Federation of Labor, the Congress of\r\nIndustrial Organizations, and the Railroad Brotherhoods--gave the\r\npositive assurance that there would be no strikes as long as the\r\nwar lasted.  And the President of the United Mine workers of America\r\nwas a party to that assurance.\r\n\r\nThat pledge was applauded throughout the country.  It was a forcible\r\nmeans of telling the world that we Americans--135,000,000 of us--\r\nare united in our determination to fight this total war with our\r\ntotal will and our total power.\r\n\r\nAt the request of employers and of organized labor--including the\r\nUnited Mine Workers--the War Labor Board was set up for settling\r\nany disputes which could not be adjusted through collective\r\nbargaining.  The War Labor Board is a tribunal on which workers,\r\nemployers and the general public are equally represented.\r\n\r\nIn the present coal crisis, conciliation and mediation were tried\r\nunsuccessfully.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the law, the case was then certified to the War\r\nLabor Board, the agency created for this express purpose with the\r\napproval of organized labor.  The members of the Board followed the\r\nusual practice which has proved successful in other disputes.\r\nActing promptly, they undertook to get all the facts of this case\r\nfrom both the miners and the operators.\r\n\r\nThe national officers of the United Mine Workers, however, declined\r\nto have anything to do with the fact-finding of the War Labor\r\nBoard.  The only excuse that they offer is that the War Labor Board\r\nis prejudiced.\r\n\r\nThe War Labor Board has been and is ready to give this case a fair\r\nand impartial hearing.  And I have given my assurance that if any\r\nadjustment of wages is made by the Board, it will be made\r\nretroactive to April first.  But the national officers of the United\r\nMine Workers refused to participate in the hearing, when asked to\r\ndo so last Monday.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday of this past week, while the Board was proceeding with\r\nthe case, stoppages began to occur in some mines.  On Thursday\r\nmorning I telegraphed to the officers of the United Mine Workers\r\nasking that the miners continue mining coal on Saturday morning.\r\nHowever, a general strike throughout the industry became effective\r\non Friday night.\r\n\r\nThe responsibility for the crisis that we now face rests squarely\r\non these national officers of the United Mine Workers, and not on\r\nthe government of the United States.  But the consequences of this\r\narbitrary action threaten all of us everywhere.\r\n\r\nAt ten o'clock yesterday morning the government took over the\r\nmines.  I called upon the miners to return to work for their\r\ngovernment.  The government needs their services just as surely as\r\nit needs the services of our soldiers, and sailors, and marines--\r\nand the services of the millions who are turning out the munitions\r\nof war.\r\n\r\nYou miners have sons in the Army and Navy and Marine Corps.  You\r\nhave sons who at this very minute--this split second--may be\r\nfighting in New Guinea, or in the Aleutian Islands, or Guadalcanal,\r\nor Tunisia, or China, or protecting troop ships and supplies\r\nagainst submarines on the high seas.  We have already received\r\ntelegrams from some of our fighting men overseas, and I only wish\r\nthey could tell you what they think of the stoppage of work in the\r\ncoal mines.\r\n\r\nSome of your own sons have come back from the fighting fronts,\r\nwounded.  A number of them, for example, are now here in an Army\r\nhospital in Washington.  Several of them have been decorated by\r\ntheir government.\r\n\r\nI could tell you of one from Pennsylvania.  He was a coal miner\r\nbefore his induction, and his father is a coal miner.  He was\r\nseriously wounded by Nazi machine gun bullets while he was on a\r\nbombing mission over Europe in a Flying Fortress.\r\n\r\nAnother boy, from Kentucky, the son of a coal miner, was wounded\r\nwhen our troops first landed in North Africa six months ago.\r\n\r\nThere is still another, from Illinois.  He was a coal miner--his\r\nfather and two brothers are coal miners.  He was seriously wounded\r\nin Tunisia while attempting to rescue two comrades whose jeep had\r\nbeen blown up by a Nazi mine.\r\n\r\nThese men do not consider themselves heroes.  They would probably be\r\nembarrassed if I mentioned their names over the air.  They were\r\nwounded in the line of duty.  They know how essential it is to the\r\ntens of thousands--hundreds of thousands--and ultimately millions\r\nof other young Americans to get the best of arms and equipment into\r\nthe hands of our fighting forces--and get them there quickly.\r\n\r\nThe fathers and mothers of our fighting men, their brothers and\r\nsisters and friends--and that includes all of us--are also in the\r\nline of duty--the production line.  Any failure in production may\r\nwell result in costly defeat on the field of battle.\r\n\r\nThere can be no one among us--no one faction powerful enough to\r\ninterrupt the forward march of our people to victory.\r\n\r\nYou miners have ample reason to know that there are certain basic\r\nrights for which this country stands, and that those rights are\r\nworth fighting for and worth dying for.  That is why you have sent\r\nyour sons and brothers from every mining town in the nation to join\r\nin the great struggle overseas.  That is why you have contributed so\r\ngenerously, so willingly, to the purchase of war bonds and to the\r\nmany funds for the relief of war victims in foreign lands.  That is\r\nwhy, since this war was started in 1939, you have increased the\r\nannual production of coal by almost two hundred million tons a\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThe toughness of your sons in our armed forces is not surprising.\r\nThey come of fine, rugged stock.  Men who work in the mines are not\r\nunaccustomed to hardship.  It has been the objective of this\r\ngovernment to reduce that hardship, to obtain for miners and for\r\nall who do the nation's work a better standard of living.\r\n\r\nI know only too well that the cost of living is troubling the\r\nminers' families, and troubling the families of millions of other\r\nworkers throughout the country as well.\r\n\r\nA year ago it became evident to all of us that something had to be\r\ndone about living costs.  Your government determined not to let the\r\ncost of living continue to go up as it did in the first World War.\r\n\r\nYour government has been determined to maintain stability of both\r\nprices and wages--so that a dollar would buy, so far as possible,\r\nthe same amount of the necessities of life.  And by necessities I\r\nmean just that--not the luxuries, not the fancy goods that we have\r\nlearned to do without in wartime.\r\n\r\nSo far, we have not been able to keep the prices of some\r\nnecessities as low as we should have liked to keep them.  That is\r\ntrue not only in coal towns but in many other places.\r\n\r\nWherever we find that prices of essentials have risen too high,\r\nthey will be brought down.  Wherever we find that price ceilings are\r\nbeing violated, the violators will be punished.\r\n\r\nRents have been fixed in most parts of the country.  In many cities\r\nthey have been cut to below where they were before we entered the\r\nwar.  Clothing prices have generally remained stable.\r\n\r\nThese two items make up more than a third of the total budget of\r\nthe worker's family.\r\n\r\nAs for food, which today accounts for about another third of the\r\nfamily expenditure on the average, I want to repeat again:  your\r\ngovernment will continue to take all necessary measures to\r\neliminate unjustified and avoidable price increases.  And we are\r\ntoday taking measures to \"roll back\" the prices of meats.\r\n\r\nThe war is going to go on.  Coal will be mined no matter what any\r\nindividual thinks about it.  The operation of our factories, our\r\npower plants, our railroads will not be stopped.  Our munitions must\r\nmove to our troops.\r\n\r\nAnd so, under these circumstances, it is inconceivable that any\r\npatriotic miner can choose any course other than going back to work\r\nand mining coal.\r\n\r\nThe nation cannot afford violence of any kind at the coal mines or\r\nin coal towns.  I have placed authority for the resumption of coal\r\nmining in the hands of a civilian, the Secretary of the Interior.\r\nIf it becomes necessary to protect any miner who seeks\r\npatriotically to go back and work, then that miner must have and\r\nhis family must have--and will have--complete and adequate\r\nprotection.  If it becomes necessary to have troops at the mine\r\nmouths or in coal towns for the protection of working miners and\r\ntheir families, those troops will be doing police duty for the sake\r\nof the nation as a whole, and particularly for the sake of the\r\nfighting men in the Army, the Navy and the Marines--your sons and\r\nmine--who are fighting our common enemies all over the world.\r\n\r\nI understand the devotion of the coal miners to their union.  I know\r\nof the sacrifices they have made to build it up.  I believe now, as\r\nI have all my life, in the right of workers to join unions and to\r\nprotect their unions.  I want to make it absolutely clear that this\r\ngovernment is not going to do anything now to weaken those rights\r\nin the coal fields.\r\n\r\nEvery improvement in the conditions of the coal miners of this\r\ncountry has had my hearty support, and I do not mean to desert them\r\nnow.  But I also do not mean to desert my obligations and\r\nresponsibilities as President of the United States and Commander-\r\nin-Chief of the Army and Navy.\r\n\r\nThe first necessity is the resumption of coal mining.  The terms of\r\nthe old contract will be followed by the Secretary of the Interior.\r\nIf an adjustment in wages results from a decision of the War Labor\r\nBoard, or from any new agreement between the operators and miners,\r\nwhich is approved by the War Labor Board, that adjustment will be\r\nmade retroactive to April first.\r\n\r\nIn the message that I delivered to the Congress four months ago, I\r\nexpressed my conviction that the spirit of this nation is good.\r\n\r\nSince then, I have seen our troops in the Caribbean area, in bases\r\non the coasts of our ally, Brazil, and in North Africa.  Recently I\r\nhave again seen great numbers of our fellow countrymen--soldiers\r\nand civilians--from the Atlantic Seaboard to the Mexican border and\r\nto the Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\nTonight, in the fact of a crisis of serious proportions in the coal\r\nindustry, I say again that the spirit or this nation is good.  I\r\nknow that the American people will not tolerate any threat offered\r\nto their government by anyone.  I believe the coal miners will not\r\ncontinue the strike against their government.  I believe that the\r\ncoal miners as Americans will not fail to heed the clear call to\r\nduty.  Like all other good Americans, they will march shoulder to\r\nshoulder with their armed forces to victory.\r\n\r\nTomorrow the Stars and Stripes will fly over the coal mines, and I\r\nhope that every miner will be at work under that flag.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJuly 28, 1943.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Fellow Americans:\r\n\r\nOver a year and a half ago I said this to the Congress:  \"The\r\nmilitarists in Berlin, and Rome and Tokyo started this war, but the\r\nmassed angered forces of common humanity will finish it.\"\r\n\r\nToday that prophecy is in the process of being fulfilled.  The\r\nmassed, angered forces of common humanity are on the march.  They\r\nare going forward--on the Russian front, in the vast Pacific area,\r\nand into Europe--converging upon their ultimate objectives:  Berlin\r\nand Tokyo.\r\n\r\nI think the first crack in the Axis has come.  The criminal, corrupt\r\nFascist regime in Italy is going to pieces.\r\n\r\nThe pirate philosophy of the Fascists and the Nazis cannot stand\r\nadversity.  The military superiority of the United Nations--on sea\r\nand land, and in the air--has been applied in the right place and\r\nat the right time.\r\n\r\nHitler refused to send sufficient help to save Mussolini.  In fact,\r\nHitler's troops in Sicily stole the Italians' motor equipment,\r\nleaving Italian soldiers so stranded that they had no choice but to\r\nsurrender.  Once again the Germans betrayed their Italian allies, as\r\nthey had done time and time again on the Russian front and in the\r\nlong retreat from Egypt, through Libya and Tripoli, to the final\r\nsurrender in Tunisia.\r\n\r\nAnd so Mussolini came to the reluctant conclusion that the \"jig was\r\nup\"; he could see the shadow of the long arm of justice.\r\n\r\nBut he and his Fascist gang will be brought to book, and punished\r\nfor their crimes against humanity.  No criminal will be allowed to\r\nescape by the expedient of \"resignation.\"\r\n\r\nSo our terms to Italy are still the same as our terms to Germany\r\nand Japan--\"unconditional surrender.\"\r\n\r\nWe will have no truck with Fascism in any way, in any shape or\r\nmanner.  We will permit no vestige of Fascism to remain.\r\n\r\nEventually Italy will reconstitute herself.  It will be the people\r\nof Italy who will do that, choosing their own government in\r\naccordance with the basic democratic principles of liberty and\r\nequality.  In the meantime, the United Nations will not follow the\r\npattern set by Mussolini and Hitler and the Japanese for the\r\ntreatment of occupied countries--the pattern of pillage and\r\nstarvation.\r\n\r\nWe are already helping the Italian people in Sicily.  With their\r\ncordial cooperation, we are establishing and maintaining security\r\nand order--we are dissolving the organizations which have kept them\r\nunder Fascist tyranny--we are providing them with the necessities\r\nof life until the time comes when they can fully provide for\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the people in Sicily today are rejoicing in the fact that\r\nfor the first time in years they are permitted to enjoy the fruits\r\nof their own labors--they can eat what they themselves grow,\r\ninstead of having it stolen from them by the Fascists and the\r\nNazis.\r\n\r\nIn every country conquered by the Nazis and the Fascists, or the\r\nJapanese militarists, the people have been reduced to the status of\r\nslaves or chattels.\r\n\r\nIt is our determination to restore these conquered peoples to the\r\ndignity of human beings, masters of their own fate, entitled to\r\nfreedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom from want, and\r\nfreedom from fear.\r\n\r\nWe have started to make good on that promise.\r\n\r\nI am sorry if I step on the toes of those Americans who, playing\r\nparty politics at home, call that kind of foreign policy \"crazy\r\naltruism \"and \"starry-eyed dreaming.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the war in Sicily and Italy goes on.  It must go on, and\r\nwill go on, until the Italian people realize the futility of\r\ncontinuing to fight in a lost cause--a cause to which the people of\r\nItaly never gave their wholehearted approval and support.\r\n\r\nIt is a little over a year since we planned the North African\r\ncampaign.  It is six months since we planned the Sicilian campaign.\r\nI confess that I am of an impatient disposition, but I think that I\r\nunderstand and that most people understand the amount of time\r\nnecessary to prepare for any major military or naval operation.  We\r\ncannot just pick up the telephone and order a new campaign to start\r\nthe next week.\r\n\r\nFor example, behind the invasion forces in North Africa, the\r\ninvasion forces that went out of North Africa, were thousands of\r\nships and planes guarding the long, perilous sea lanes, carrying\r\nthe men, carrying the equipment and the supplies to the point of\r\nattack.  And behind all these were the railroad lines and the\r\nhighways here back home that carried the men and the munitions to\r\nthe ports of embarkation--there were the factories and the mines\r\nand the farms here back home that turned out the materials--there\r\nwere the training camps here back home where the men learned how to\r\nperform the strange and difficult and dangerous tasks which were to\r\nmeet them on the beaches and in the deserts and in the mountains.\r\n\r\nAll this had to be repeated, first in North Africa and then in the\r\nattack on Sicily.  Here the factor--in Sicily--the factor of air\r\nattack was added--for we could use North Africa as the base for\r\nsoftening up the landing places and lines of defense in Sicily, and\r\nthe lines of supply in Italy.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting for us to realize that every flying fortress that\r\nbombed harbor installations at, for example, Naples, from its base\r\nin North Africa required 1,110 gallons of gasoline for each single\r\nmission, and that this is the equal of about 375 \"A\" ration\r\ntickets--enough gas to drive your car five times across this\r\ncontinent.  You will better understand your part in the war--and\r\nwhat gasoline rationing means--if you multiply this by the gasoline\r\nneeds of thousands of planes and hundreds of thousands of jeeps,\r\nand trucks and tanks that are now serving overseas.\r\n\r\nI think that the personal convenience of the individual, or the\r\nindividual family back home here in the United States will appear\r\nsomewhat less important when I tell you that the initial assault\r\nforce on Sicily involved 3,000 ships which carried 160,000 men--\r\nAmericans, British, Canadians and French--together with 14,000\r\nvehicles, 600 tanks, and 1,800 guns.  And this initial force was\r\nfollowed every day and every night by thousands of reinforcements.\r\n\r\nThe meticulous care with which the operation in Sicily was planned\r\nhas paid dividends.  Our casualties in men, in ships and material\r\nhave been low--in fact, far below our estimate.\r\n\r\nAnd all of us are proud of the superb skill and courage of the\r\nofficers and men who have conducted and are conducting those\r\noperations.  The toughest resistance developed on the front of the\r\nBritish Eighth Army, which included the Canadians.  But that is no\r\nnew experience for that magnificent fighting force which has made\r\nthe Germans pay a heavy price for each hour of delay in the final\r\nvictory.  The American Seventh Army, after a stormy landing on the\r\nexposed beaches of southern Sicily, swept with record speed across\r\nthe island into the capital at Palermo.  For many of our troops this\r\nwas their first battle experience, but they have carried themselves\r\nlike veterans.\r\n\r\nAnd we must give credit for the coordination of the diverse forces\r\nin the field, and for the planning of the whole campaign, to the\r\nwise and skillful leadership of General Eisenhower.  Admiral\r\nCunningham, General Alexander and Sir Marshal Tedder have been\r\ntowers of strength in handling the complex details of naval and\r\nground and air activities.\r\n\r\nYou have heard some people say that the British and the Americans\r\ncan never get along well together--you have heard some people say\r\nthat the Army and the Navy and the Air Forces can never get along\r\nwell together--that real cooperation between them is impossible.\r\nTunisia and Sicily have given the lie, once and for all, to these\r\nnarrow-minded prejudices.\r\n\r\nThe dauntless fighting spirit of the British people in this war has\r\nbeen expressed in the historic words and deeds of Winston\r\nChurchill--and the world knows how the American people feel about\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAhead of us are much bigger fights.  We and our Allies will go into\r\nthem as we went into Sicily--together.  And we shall carry on\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nToday our production of ships is almost unbelievable.  This year we\r\nare producing over nineteen million tons of merchant shipping and\r\nnext year our production will be over twenty-one million tons.  And\r\nin addition to our shipments across the Atlantic, we must realize\r\nthat in this war we are operating in the Aleutians, in the distant\r\nparts of the Southwest Pacific, in India, and off the shores of\r\nSouth America.\r\n\r\nFor several months we have been losing fewer ships by sinkings, and\r\nwe have been destroying more and more U-boats.  We hope this will\r\ncontinue.  But we cannot be sure.  We must not lower our guard for\r\none single instant.\r\n\r\nOne tangible result of our great increase in merchant shipping--\r\nwhich I think will be good news to civilians at home--is that\r\ntonight we are able to terminate the rationing of coffee.  We also\r\nexpect that within a short time we shall get greatly increased\r\nallowances of sugar.\r\n\r\nThose few Americans who grouse and complain about the\r\ninconveniences of life here in the United States should learn some\r\nlessons from the civilian populations of our Allies--Britain, and\r\nChina, and Russia--and of all the lands occupied by our common\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\nThe heaviest and most decisive fighting today is going on in\r\nRussia.  I am glad that the British and we have been able to\r\ncontribute somewhat to the great striking power of the Russian\r\narmies.\r\n\r\nIn 1941-1942 the Russians were able to retire without breaking, to\r\nmove many of their war plants from western Russia far into the\r\ninterior, to stand together with complete unanimity in the defense\r\nof their homeland.\r\n\r\nThe success of the Russian armies has shown that it is dangerous to\r\nmake prophecies about them--a fact which has been forcibly brought\r\nhome to that mystic master of strategic intuition, Herr Hitler.\r\n\r\nThe short-lived German offensive, launched early this month, was a\r\ndesperate attempt to bolster the morale of the German people.  The\r\nRussians were not fooled by this.  They went ahead with their own\r\nplans for attack--plans which coordinate with the whole United\r\nNations' offensive strategy.\r\n\r\nThe world has never seen greater devotion, determination and self-\r\nsacrifice than have been displayed by the Russian people and their\r\narmies, under the leadership of Marshal Joseph Stalin.\r\n\r\nWith a nation which in saving itself is thereby helping to save all\r\nthe world from the Nazi menace, this country of ours should always\r\nbe glad to be a good neighbor and a sincere friend in the world of\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\nIn the Pacific, we are pushing the Japs around from the Aleutians\r\nto New Guinea.  There too we have taken the initiative--and we are\r\nnot going to let go of it.\r\n\r\nIt becomes clearer and clearer that the attrition, the whittling\r\ndown process against the Japanese is working.  The Japs have lost\r\nmore planes and more ships than they have been able to replace.\r\n\r\nThe continuous and energetic prosecution of the war of attrition\r\nwill drive the Japs back from their over-extended line running from\r\nBurma and Siam and the Straits Settlement through the Netherlands\r\nIndies to eastern New Guinea and the Solomons.  And we have good\r\nreason to believe that their shipping and their air power cannot\r\nsupport such outposts.\r\n\r\nOur naval and land and air strength in the Pacific is constantly\r\ngrowing.  And if the Japanese are basing their future plans for the\r\nPacific on a long period in which they will be permitted to\r\nconsolidate and exploit their conquered resources, they had better\r\nstart revising their plans now.  I give that to them merely as a\r\nhelpful suggestion.\r\n\r\nWe are delivering planes and vital war supplies for the heroic\r\narmies of Generalissimo Chiang Sai-shek, and we must do more at all\r\ncosts.\r\n\r\nOur air supply line from India to China across enemy territory\r\ncontinues despite attempted Japanese interference.  We have seized\r\nthe initiative from the Japanese in the air over Burma and now we\r\nenjoy superiority.  We are bombing Japanese communications, supply\r\ndumps, and bases in China, in Indo-China, in Burma.\r\n\r\nBut we are still far from our main objectives in the war against\r\nJapan.  Let us remember, however, how far we were a year ago from\r\nany of our objectives in the European theatre.  We are pushing\r\nforward to occupation of positions which in time will enable us to\r\nattack the Japanese Islands themselves from the North, from the\r\nSouth, from the East, and from the West.\r\n\r\nYou have heard it said that while we are succeeding greatly on the\r\nfighting front, we are failing miserably on the home front.  I think\r\nthis is another of those immaturities--a false slogan easy to state\r\nbut untrue in the essential facts.\r\n\r\nFor the longer this war goes on the clearer it becomes that no one\r\ncan draw a blue pencil down the middle of a page and call one side\r\n\"the fighting front\" and the other side \"the home front.\"  For the\r\ntwo of them are inexorably tied together.\r\n\r\nEvery combat division, every naval task force, every squadron of\r\nfighting planes is dependent for its equipment and ammunition and\r\nfuel and food, as indeed it is for its manpower, dependent on the\r\nAmerican people in civilian clothes in the offices and in the\r\nfactories and on the farms at home.\r\n\r\nThe same kind of careful planning that gained victory in North\r\nAfrica and Sicily is required, if we are to make victory an\r\nenduring reality and do our share in building the kind of peaceful\r\nworld that will justify the sacrifices made in this war.\r\n\r\nThe United Nations are substantially agreed on the general\r\nobjectives for the post-war world.  They are also agreed that this\r\nis not the time to engage in an international discussion of _all_\r\nthe terms of peace and _all_ the details of the future.  Let us win\r\nthe war first.  We must not relax our pressure on the enemy by\r\ntaking time out to define every boundary and settle every political\r\ncontroversy in every part of the world.  The important thing--the\r\nall-important thing now is to get on with the war--and to win it.\r\n\r\nWhile concentrating on military victory, we are not neglecting the\r\nplanning of the things to come, the freedoms which we know will\r\nmake for more decency and greater justice throughout the world.\r\n\r\nAmong many other things we are, today, laying plans for the return\r\nto civilian life of our gallant men and women in the armed\r\nservices.  They must not be demobilized into an environment of\r\ninflation and unemployment, to a place on a bread line, or on a\r\ncorner selling apples.  We must, this time, have plans ready--\r\ninstead of waiting to do a hasty, inefficient, and ill-considered\r\njob at the last moment.\r\n\r\nI have assured our men in the armed forces that the American people\r\nwould not let them down when the war is won.\r\n\r\nI hope that the Congress will help in carrying out this assurance,\r\nfor obviously the executive branch of the government cannot do it\r\nalone.  May the Congress do its duty in this regard.  The American\r\npeople will insist on fulfilling this American obligation to the\r\nmen and women in the armed forces who are winning this war for us.\r\n\r\nOf course, the returning soldier and sailor and marine are a part\r\nof the problem of demobilizing the rest of the millions of\r\nAmericans who have been working and living in a war economy since\r\n1941.  That larger objective of reconverting wartime America to a\r\npeacetime basis is one for which your government is laying plans to\r\nbe submitted to the Congress for action.\r\n\r\nBut the members of the armed forces have been compelled to make\r\ngreater economic sacrifice and every other kind of sacrifice than\r\nthe rest of us, and they are entitled to definite action to help\r\ntake care of their special problems.\r\n\r\nThe least to which they are entitled, it seems to me, is something\r\nlike this:\r\n\r\nFirst, mustering-out pay to every member of the armed forces and\r\nmerchant marine when he or she is honorably discharged; mustering-\r\nout pay large enough in each case to cover a reasonable period of\r\ntime between his discharge and the finding of a new job.\r\n\r\nSecond, in case no job is found after diligent search, then\r\nunemployment insurance if the individual registers with the United\r\nStates Employment Service.\r\n\r\nThird, an opportunity for members of the armed services to get\r\nfurther education or trade training at the cost of the government.\r\n\r\nFourth, allowance of credit to all members of the armed forces,\r\nunder unemployment compensation and federal old-age and survivors'\r\ninsurance, for their period of service.  For these purposes they\r\nought to be treated as if they had continued their employment in\r\nprivate industry.\r\n\r\nFifth, improved and liberalized provisions for hospitalization, for\r\nrehabilitation, for medical care of disabled members of the armed\r\nforces and the merchant marine.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, sufficient pensions for disabled members of the armed\r\nforces.\r\n\r\nYour government is drawing up other serious, constructive plans for\r\ncertain immediate forward moves.  They concern food, manpower, and\r\nother domestic problems that tie in with our armed forces.\r\n\r\nWithin a few weeks I shall speak with you again in regard to\r\ndefinite actions to be taken by the executive branch of the\r\ngovernment, and specific recommendations for new legislation by the\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nAll our calculations for the future, however, must be based on\r\nclear understanding of the problems involved.  And that can be\r\ngained only by straight thinking--not guesswork, not political\r\nmanipulation.\r\n\r\nI confess that I myself am sometimes bewildered by conflicting\r\nstatements that I see in the press.  One day I read an\r\n\"authoritative\" statement that we shall win the war this year,\r\n1943--and the next day comes another statement equally\r\n\"authoritative,\" that the war will still be going on in 1949.\r\n\r\nOf course, both extremes--of optimism and pessimism--are wrong.\r\n\r\nThe length of the war will depend upon the uninterrupted\r\ncontinuance of all-out effort on the fighting fronts and here at\r\nhome, and that effort is all one.\r\n\r\nThe American soldier does not like the necessity of waging war.  And\r\nyet--if he lays off for one single instant he may lose his own life\r\nand sacrifice the lives of his comrades.\r\n\r\nBy the same token--a worker here at home may not like the driving,\r\nwartime conditions under which he has to work and live.  And yet--if\r\nhe gets complacent or indifferent and slacks on his job, he too may\r\nsacrifice the lives of American soldiers and contribute to the loss\r\nof an important battle.\r\n\r\nThe next time anyone says to you that this war is \"in the bag,\" or\r\nsays \"it's all over but the shouting,\" you should ask him these\r\nquestions:\r\n\r\n\"Are you working full time on your job?\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you growing all the food you can?\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you buying your limit of war bonds?\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you loyally and cheerfully cooperating with your government in\r\npreventing inflation and profiteering, and in making rationing work\r\nwith fairness to all?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because--if your answer is 'No'--then the war is going to last a\r\nlot longer than you think.˛\r\n\r\nThe plans we made for the knocking out of Mussolini and his gang\r\nhave largely succeeded.  But we still have to knock out Hitler and\r\nhis gang, and Tojo and his gang.  No one of us pretends that this\r\nwill be an easy matter.\r\n\r\nWe still have to defeat Hitler and Tojo on their own home grounds.\r\nBut this will require a far greater concentration of our national\r\nenergy and our ingenuity and our skill.\r\n\r\nIt is not too much to say that we must pour into this war the\r\nentire strength and intelligence and will power of the United\r\nStates.  We are a great nation--a rich nation--but we are not so\r\ngreat or so rich that we can afford to waste our substance or the\r\nlives or our men by relaxing along the way.\r\n\r\nWe shall not settle for less than total victory.  That is the\r\ndetermination of every American on the fighting fronts.  That must\r\nbe, and will be, the determination of every American here at home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSeptember 8, 1943.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Fellow Americans:\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time, a few years ago, there was a city in our Middle\r\nWest which was threatened by a destructive flood in the great\r\nriver.  The waters had risen to the top of the banks.  Every man,\r\nwoman and child in that city was called upon to fill sand bags in\r\norder to defend their homes against the rising waters.  For many\r\ndays and nights, destruction and death stared them in the face.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the grim, determined community effort, that city\r\nstill stands.  Those people kept the levees above the peak of the\r\nflood.  All of them joined together in the desperate job that had to\r\nbe done--business men, workers, farmers, and doctors, and\r\npreachers--people of all races.\r\n\r\nTo me, that town is a living symbol of what community cooperation\r\ncan accomplish.\r\n\r\nToday, in the same kind of community effort, only very much larger,\r\nthe United Nations and their peoples have kept the levees of\r\ncivilization high enough to prevent the floods of aggression and\r\nbarbarism and wholesale murder from engulfing us all.  The flood has\r\nbeen raging for four years.  At last we are beginning to gain on it;\r\nbut the waters have not yet receded enough for us to relax our\r\nsweating work with the sand bags.  In this war bond campaign we are\r\nfilling bags and placing them against the flood--bags which are\r\nessential if we are to stand off the ugly torrent which is trying\r\nto sweep us all away.\r\n\r\nToday, it is announced that an armistice with Italy has been\r\nconcluded.\r\n\r\nThis was a great victory for the United Nations--but it was also a\r\ngreat victory for the Italian people.  After years of war and\r\nsuffering and degradation, the Italian people are at last coming to\r\nthe day of liberation from their real enemies, the Nazis.\r\n\r\nBut let us not delude ourselves that this armistice means the end\r\nof the war in the Mediterranean.  We still have to drive the Germans\r\nout of Italy as we have driven them out of Tunisia and Sicily; we\r\nmust drive them out of France and all other captive countries; and\r\nwe must strike them on their own soil from all directions.\r\n\r\nOur ultimate objectives in this war continue to be Berlin and\r\nTokyo.\r\n\r\nI ask you to bear these objectives constantly in mind--and do not\r\nforget that we still have a long way to go before we attain them.\r\n\r\nThe great news that you have heard today from General Eisenhower\r\ndoes not give you license to settle back in your rocking chairs and\r\nsay, \"Well, that does it.  We've got 'em on the run.  Now we can\r\nstart the celebration.\"\r\n\r\nThe time for celebration is not yet.  And I have a suspicion that\r\nwhen this war does end, we shall not be in a very celebrating mood,\r\na very celebrating frame of mind.  I think that our main emotion\r\nwill be one of grim determination that this shall not happen again.\r\n\r\nDuring the past weeks, Mr. Churchill and I have been in constant\r\nconference with the leaders of our combined fighting forces.  We\r\nhave been in constant communication with our fighting Allies,\r\nRussian and Chinese, who are prosecuting the war with relentless\r\ndetermination and with conspicuous success on far distant fronts.\r\nAnd Mr. Churchill and I are here together in Washington at this\r\ncrucial moment.\r\n\r\nWe have seen the satisfactory fulfillment of plans that were made\r\nin Casablanca last January and here in Washington last May.  And\r\nlately we have made new, extensive plans for the future.  But\r\nthroughout these conferences we have never lost sight of the fact\r\nthat this war will become bigger and tougher, rather than easier,\r\nduring the long months that are to come.\r\n\r\nThis war does not and must not stop for one single instant.  Your\r\nfighting men know that.  Those of them who are moving forward\r\nthrough jungles against lurking Japs--those who are landing at this\r\nmoment, in barges moving through the dawn up to strange enemy\r\ncoasts--those who are diving their bombers down on the targets at\r\nroof-top level at this moment--every one of these men knows that\r\nthis war is a full-time job and that it will continue to be that\r\nuntil total victory is won.\r\n\r\nAnd, by the same token, every responsible leader in all the United\r\nNations knows that the fighting goes on twenty-four hours a day,\r\nseven days a week, and that any day lost may have to be paid for in\r\nterms of months added to the duration of the war.\r\n\r\nEvery campaign, every single operation in all the campaigns that we\r\nplan and carry through must be figured in terms of staggering\r\nmaterial costs.  We cannot afford to be niggardly with any of our\r\nresources, for we shall need all of them to do the job that we have\r\nput our shoulder to.\r\n\r\nYour fellow Americans have given a magnificent account of\r\nthemselves--on the battlefields and on the oceans and in the skies\r\nall over the world.\r\n\r\nNow it is up to you to prove to them that you are contributing your\r\nshare and more than your share.  It is not sufficient to simply to\r\nput into War Bonds money which we would normally save.  We must put\r\ninto War Bonds money which we would not normally save.  Only then\r\nhave we done everything that good conscience demands.  So it is up\r\nto you--up to you, the Americans in the American homes--the very\r\nhomes which our sons and daughters are working and fighting and\r\ndying to preserve.\r\n\r\nI know I speak for every man and woman throughout the Americas when\r\nI say that we Americans will not be satisfied to send our troops\r\ninto the fire of the enemy with equipment inferior in any way.  Nor\r\nwill we be satisfied to send our troops with equipment only equal\r\nto that of the enemy.  We are determined to provide our troops with\r\noverpowering superiority--superiority of quantity and quality in\r\nany and every category of arms and armaments that they may\r\nconceivably need.\r\n\r\nAnd where does this our dominating power come from?  Why, it can\r\ncome only from you.  The money you lend and the money you give in\r\ntaxes buys that death-dealing, and at the same time life-saving\r\npower that we need for victory.  This is an expensive war--expensive\r\nin money; you can help it--you can help to keep it at a minimum\r\ncost in lives.\r\n\r\nThe American people will never stop to reckon the cost of redeeming\r\ncivilization.  They know there can never be any economic\r\njustification for failing to save freedom.\r\n\r\nWe can be sure that our enemies will watch this drive with the\r\nkeenest interest.  They know that success in this undertaking will\r\nshorten the war.  They know that the more money the American people\r\nlend to their government, the more powerful and relentless will be\r\nthe American forces in the field.  They know that only a united and\r\ndetermined America could possibly produce on a voluntary basis so\r\nhuge a sum of money as fifteen billion dollars.\r\n\r\nThe overwhelming success of the Second War Loan Drive last April\r\nshowed that the people of this Democracy stood firm behind their\r\ntroops.\r\n\r\nThis Third War Loan, which we are starting tonight, will also\r\nsucceed--because the American people will not permit it to fail.\r\n\r\nI cannot tell you how much to invest in War Bonds during this Third\r\nWar Loan Drive.  No one can tell you.  It is for you to decide under\r\nthe guidance of your own conscience.\r\n\r\nI will say this, however.  Because the nation's needs are greater\r\nthan ever before, our sacrifices too must be greater than they have\r\never been before.\r\n\r\nNobody knows when total victory will come--but we do know that the\r\nharder we fight now, the more might and power we direct at the\r\nenemy now, the shorter the war will be and the smaller the sum\r\ntotal of sacrifice.\r\n\r\nSuccess of the Third War Loan will be the symbol that America does\r\nnot propose to rest on its arms--that we know the tough, bitter job\r\nahead and will not stop until we have finished it.\r\n\r\nNow it is your turn!\r\n\r\nEvery dollar that you invest in the Third War Loan is your personal\r\nmessage of defiance to our common enemies--to the ruthless savages\r\nof Germany and Japan--and it is your personal message of faith and\r\ngood cheer to our Allies and to all the men at the front.  God bless\r\nthem!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDecember 24, 1943.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Friends:\r\n\r\nI have recently returned from extensive journeying in the region of\r\nthe Mediterranean and as far as the borders of Russia.  I have\r\nconferred with the leaders of Britain and Russia and China on\r\nmilitary matters of the present--especially on plans for stepping-\r\nup our successful attack on our enemies as quickly as possible and\r\nfrom many different points of the compass.\r\n\r\nOn this Christmas Eve there are over 10,000,000 men in the armed\r\nforces of the United States alone.  One year ago 1,700,000 were\r\nserving overseas.  Today, this figure has been more than doubled to\r\n3,800,000 on duty overseas.  By next July first that number overseas\r\nwill rise to over 5,000,000 men and women.\r\n\r\nThat this is truly a World War was demonstrated to me when\r\narrangements were being made with our overseas broadcasting\r\nagencies for the time to speak today to our soldiers, and sailors,\r\nand marines and merchant seamen in every part of the world.  In\r\nfixing the time for this broadcast, we took into consideration that\r\nat this moment here in the United States, and in the Caribbean and\r\non the Northeast Coast of South America, it is afternoon.  In Alaska\r\nand in Hawaii and the mid-Pacific, it is still morning.  In Iceland,\r\nin Great Britain, in North Africa, in Italy and the Middle East, it\r\nis now evening.\r\n\r\nIn the Southwest Pacific, in Australia, in China and Burma and\r\nIndia, it is already Christmas Day.  So we can correctly say that at\r\nthis moment, in those far eastern parts where Americans are\r\nfighting, today is tomorrow.\r\n\r\nBut everywhere throughout the world--throughout this war that\r\ncovers the world--there is a special spirit that has warmed our\r\nhearts since our earliest childhood--a spirit that brings us close\r\nto our homes, our families, our friends and neighbors--the\r\nChristmas spirit of \"peace on earth, good will toward men.\"  It is\r\nan unquenchable spirit.\r\n\r\nDuring the past years of international gangsterism and brutal\r\naggression in Europe and in Asia, our Christmas celebrations have\r\nbeen darkened with apprehension for the future.  We have said,\r\n\"Merry Christmas--a Happy New Year,\" but we have known in our\r\nhearts that the clouds which have hung over our world have\r\nprevented us from saying it with full sincerity and conviction.\r\n\r\nAnd even this year, we still have much to face in the way of\r\nfurther suffering, and sacrifice, and personal tragedy.  Our men,\r\nwho have been through the fierce battles in the Solomons, and the\r\nGilberts, and Tunisia and Italy know, from their own experience and\r\nknowledge of modern war, that many bigger and costlier battles are\r\nstill to be fought.\r\n\r\nBut--on Christmas Eve this year--I can say to you that at last we\r\nmay look forward into the future with real, substantial confidence\r\nthat, however great the cost, \"peace on earth, good will toward\r\nmen\" can be and will be realized and ensured.  This year I _can_ say\r\nthat.  Last year I could _not_ do more than express a hope.  Today I\r\nexpress a certainty--though the cost may be high and the time may\r\nbe long.\r\n\r\nWithin the past year--within the past few weeks--history has been\r\nmade, and it is far better history for the whole human race than\r\nany that we have known, or even dared to hope for, in these tragic\r\ntimes through which we pass.\r\n\r\nA great beginning was made in the Moscow conference last October by\r\nMr.  Molotov, Mr. Eden and our own Mr. Hull.  There and then the way\r\nwas paved for the later meetings.\r\n\r\nAt Cairo and Teheran we devoted ourselves not only to military\r\nmatters; we devoted ourselves also to consideration of the future--\r\nto plans for the kind of world which alone can justify all the\r\nsacrifices of this war.\r\n\r\nOf course, as you all know, Mr. Churchill and I have happily met\r\nmany times before, and we know and understand each other very well.\r\nIndeed, Mr. Churchill has become known and beloved by many millions\r\nof Americans, and the heartfelt prayers of all of us have been with\r\nthis great citizen of the world in his recent serious illness.\r\n\r\nThe Cairo and Teheran conferences, however, gave me my first\r\nopportunity to meet the Generalissimo, Chiang Kai-shek, and Marshal\r\nStalin--and to sit down at the table with these unconquerable men\r\nand talk with them face to face.  We had planned to talk to each\r\nother across the table at Cairo and Teheran; but we soon found that\r\nwe were all on the same side of the table.  We came to the\r\nconferences with faith in each other.  But we needed the personal\r\ncontact.  And now we have supplemented faith with definite\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nIt was well worth traveling thousands of miles over land and sea to\r\nbring about this personal meeting, and to gain the heartening\r\nassurance that we are absolutely agreed with one another on all the\r\nmajor objectives--and on the military means of obtaining them.\r\n\r\nAt Cairo, Prime Minister Churchill and I spent four days with the\r\nGeneralissimo, Chiang Kai-shek.  It was the first time that we had\r\nan opportunity to go over the complex situation in the Far East\r\nwith him personally.  We were able not only to settle upon definite\r\nmilitary strategy, but also to discuss certain long-range\r\nprinciples which we believe can assure peace in the Far East for\r\nmany generations to come.\r\n\r\nThose principles are as simple as they are fundamental.  They\r\ninvolve the restoration of stolen property to its rightful owners,\r\nand the recognition of the rights of millions of people in the Far\r\nEast to build up their own forms of self-government without\r\nmolestation.  Essential to all peace and security in the Pacific and\r\nin the rest of the world is the permanent elimination of the Empire\r\nof Japan as a potential force of aggression.  Never again must our\r\nsoldiers and sailors and marines--and other soldiers, sailors and\r\nmarines--be compelled to fight from island to island as they are\r\nfighting so gallantly and so successfully today.\r\n\r\nIncreasingly powerful forces are now hammering at the Japanese at\r\nmany points over an enormous arc which curves down through the\r\nPacific from the Aleutians to the Jungles of Burma.  Our own Army\r\nand Navy, our Air Forces, the Australians and New Zealanders, the\r\nDutch, and the British land, air and sea forces are all forming a\r\nband of steel which is slowly but surely closing in on Japan.\r\n\r\nOn the mainland of Asia, under the Generalissimo's leadership, the\r\nChinese ground and air forces augmented by American air forces are\r\nplaying a vital part in starting the drive which will push the\r\ninvaders into the sea.\r\n\r\nFollowing out the military decisions at Cairo, General Marshall has\r\njust flown around the world and has had conferences with General\r\nMacArthur and Admiral Nimitz--conferences which will spell plenty\r\nof bad news for the Japs in the not too far distant future.\r\n\r\nI met in the Generalissimo a man of great vision, great courage,\r\nand a remarkably keen understanding of the problems of today and\r\ntomorrow.  We discussed all the manifold military plans for striking\r\nat Japan with decisive force from many directions, and I believe I\r\ncan say that he returned to Chungking with the positive assurance\r\nof total victory over our common enemy.  Today we and the Republic\r\nof China are closer together than ever before in deep friendship\r\nand in unity of purpose.\r\n\r\nAfter the Cairo conference, Mr. Churchill and I went by airplane to\r\nTeheran.  There we met with Marshal Stalin.  We talked with complete\r\nfrankness on every conceivable subject connected with the winning\r\nof the war and the establishment of a durable peace after the war.\r\n\r\nWithin three days of intense and consistently amicable discussions,\r\nwe agreed on every point concerned with the launching of a gigantic\r\nattack upon Germany.\r\n\r\nThe Russian army will continue its stern offensives on Germany's\r\nEastern front, the allied armies in Italy and Africa will bring\r\nrelentless pressure on Germany from the south, and now the\r\nencirclement will be complete as great American and British forces\r\nattack from other points of the compass.\r\n\r\nThe Commander selected to lead the combined attack from these other\r\npoints is General Dwight D. Eisenhower.  His performances in Africa,\r\nin Sicily and in Italy have been brilliant.  He knows by practical\r\nand successful experience the way to coordinate air, sea and land\r\npower.  All of these will be under his control.  Lieutenant General\r\nCarl D. Spaatz will command the entire American strategic bombing\r\nforce operating against Germany.\r\n\r\nGeneral Eisenhower gives up his command in the Mediterranean to a\r\nBritish officer whose name is being announced by Mr. Churchill.  We\r\nnow pledge that new Commander that our powerful ground, sea and air\r\nforces in the vital Mediterranean area will stand by his side until\r\nevery objective in that bitter theatre is attained.\r\n\r\nBoth of these new Commanders will have American and British\r\nsubordinate Commanders whose names will be announced to the world\r\nin a few days.\r\n\r\nDuring the last two days at Teheran, Marshal Stalin, Mr. Churchill\r\nand I looked ahead--ahead to the days and months and years that\r\nwill follow Germany's defeat.  We were united in determination that\r\nGermany must be stripped of her military might and be given no\r\nopportunity within the foreseeable future to regain that might.\r\n\r\nThe United Nations have no intention to enslave the German people.\r\nWe wish them to have a normal chance to develop, in peace, as\r\nuseful and respectable members of the European family.  But we most\r\ncertainly emphasize that word \"respectable\"--for we intend to rid\r\nthem once and for all of Nazism and Prussian militarism and the\r\nfantastic and disastrous notion that they constitute the \"Master\r\nRace.\"\r\n\r\nWe did discuss international relationships from the point of view\r\nof big, broad objectives, rather than details.  But on the basis of\r\nwhat we did discuss, I can say even today that I do not think any\r\ninsoluble differences will arise among Russia, Great Britain and\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nIn these conferences we were concerned with basic principles--\r\nprinciples which involve the security and the welfare and the\r\nstandard of living or human beings in countries large and small.\r\n\r\nTo use an American and somewhat ungrammatical colloquialism, I may\r\nsay that I \"got along fine\" with Marshal Stalin.  He is a man who\r\ncombines a tremendous, relentless determination with a stalwart\r\ngood humor.  I believe he is truly representative of the heart and\r\nsoul of Russia; and I believe that we are going to get along very\r\nwell with him and the Russian people--very well indeed.\r\n\r\nBritain, Russia, China and the United States and their Allies\r\nrepresent more than three-quarters of the total population of the\r\nearth.  As long as these four nations with great military power\r\nstick together in determination to keep the peace there will be no\r\npossibility of an aggressor nation arising to start another world\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nBut those four powers must be united with and cooperate with all\r\nthe freedom-loving peoples of Europe, and Asia, and Africa and the\r\nAmericas.  The rights of every nation, large or small, must be\r\nrespected and guarded as jealously as are the rights of every\r\nindividual within our own republic.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine that the strong shall dominate the weak is the\r\ndoctrine of our enemies--and we reject it.\r\n\r\nBut, at the same time, we are agreed that if force is necessary to\r\nkeep international peace, international force will be applied--for\r\nas long as it may be necessary.\r\n\r\nIt has been our steady policy--and it is certainly a common sense\r\npolicy--that the right of each nation to freedom must be measured\r\nby the willingness of that nation to fight for freedom.  And today\r\nwe salute our unseen Allies in occupied countries--the underground\r\nresistance groups and the armies of liberation.  They will provide\r\npotent forces against our enemies, when the day of the counter-\r\ninvasion comes.\r\n\r\nThrough the development of science the world has become so much\r\nsmaller that we have had to discard the geographical yardsticks of\r\nthe past.  For instance, through our early history the Atlantic and\r\nPacific Oceans were believed to be walls of safety for the United\r\nStates.  Time and distance made it physically possible, for example,\r\nfor us and for the other American Republics to obtain and maintain\r\nour independence against infinitely stronger powers.  Until recently\r\nvery few people, even military experts, thought that the day would\r\never come when we might have to defend our Pacific Coast against\r\nJapanese threats of invasion.\r\n\r\nAt the outbreak of the first World War relatively few people\r\nthought that our ships and shipping would be menaced by German\r\nsubmarines on the high seas or that the German militarists would\r\never attempt to dominate any nation outside of central Europe.\r\n\r\nAfter the Armistice in 1918, we thought and hoped that the\r\nmilitaristic philosophy of Germany had been crushed; and being full\r\nof the milk of human kindness we spent the next twenty years\r\ndisarming, while the Germans whined so pathetically that the other\r\nnations permitted them--and even helped them--to rearm.\r\n\r\nFor too many years we lived on pious hopes that aggressor and\r\nwarlike nations would learn and understand and carry out the\r\ndoctrine of purely voluntary peace.\r\n\r\nThe well-intentioned but ill-fated experiments of former years did\r\nnot work.  It is my hope that we will not try them again.  No--that\r\nis putting it too weakly--it is my intention to do all that I\r\nhumanly can as President and Commander-in-Chief to see to it that\r\nthese tragic mistakes shall not be made again.\r\n\r\nThere have always been cheerful idiots in this country who believed\r\nthat there would be no more war for us, if everybody in America\r\nwould only return into their homes and lock their front doors\r\nbehind them.  Assuming that their motives were of the highest,\r\nevents have shown how unwilling they were to face the facts.\r\n\r\nThe overwhelming majority of all the people in the world want\r\npeace.  Most of them are fighting for the attainment of peace--not\r\njust a truce, not just an armistice--but peace that is as strongly\r\nenforced and as durable as mortal man can make it.  If we are\r\nwilling to fight for peace now, is it not good logic that we should\r\nuse force if necessary, in the future, to keep the peace?\r\n\r\nI believe, and I think I can say, that the other three great\r\nnations who are fighting so magnificently to gain peace are in\r\ncomplete agreement that we must be prepared to keep the peace by\r\nforce.  If the people of Germany and Japan are made to realize\r\nthoroughly that the world is not going to let them break out again,\r\nit is possible, and, I hope, probable, that they will abandon the\r\nphilosophy of aggression--the belief that they can gain the whole\r\nworld even at the risk of losing their own souls.\r\n\r\nI shall have more to say about the Cairo and Teheran conferences\r\nwhen I make my report to the Congress in about two weeks' time.\r\nAnd, on that occasion, I shall also have a great deal to say about\r\ncertain conditions here at home.\r\n\r\nBut today I wish to say that in all my travels, at home and abroad,\r\nit is the sight of our soldiers and sailors and their magnificent\r\nachievements which have given me the greatest inspiration and the\r\ngreatest encouragement for the future.\r\n\r\nTo the members of our armed forces, to their wives, mothers and\r\nfathers, I want to affirm the great faith and confidence that we\r\nhave in General Marshall and in Admiral King who direct all of our\r\narmed might throughout the world.  Upon them falls the great\r\nresponsibility of planning the strategy of determining where and\r\nwhen we shall fight.  Both of these men have already gained high\r\nplaces in American history, places which will record in that\r\nhistory many evidences of their military genius that cannot be\r\npublished today.\r\n\r\nSome of our men overseas are now spending their third Christmas far\r\nfrom home.  To them and to all others overseas or soon to go\r\noverseas, I can give assurance that it is the purpose of their\r\ngovernment to win this war and to bring them home at the earliest\r\npossible time.\r\n\r\nWe here in the United States had better be sure that when our\r\nsoldiers and sailors do come home they will find an America in\r\nwhich they are given full opportunities for education, and\r\nrehabilitation, social security, and employment and business\r\nenterprise under the free American system--and that they will find\r\na government which, by their votes as American citizens, they have\r\nhad a full share in electing.\r\n\r\nThe American people have had every reason to know that this is a\r\ntough and destructive war.  On my trip abroad, I talked with many\r\nmilitary men who had faced our enemies in the field.  These hard-\r\nheaded realists testify to the strength and skill and\r\nresourcefulness of the enemy generals and men whom we must beat\r\nbefore final victory is won.  The war is now reaching the stage\r\nwhere we shall all have to look forward to large casualty lists--\r\ndead, wounded and missing.\r\n\r\nWar entails just that.  There is no easy road to victory.  And the\r\nend is not yet in sight.\r\n\r\nI have been back only for a week.  It is fair that I should tell you\r\nmy impression.  I think I see a tendency in some of our people here\r\nto assume a quick ending of the war--that we have already gained\r\nthe victory.  And, perhaps as a result of this false reasoning, I\r\nthink I discern an effort to resume or even encourage an outbreak\r\nof partisan thinking and talking.  I hope I am wrong.  For, surely,\r\nour first and most foremost tasks are all concerned with winning\r\nthe war and winning a just peace that will last for generations.\r\n\r\nThe massive offensives which are in the making both in Europe and\r\nthe Far East--will require every ounce of energy and fortitude that\r\nwe and our Allies can summon on the fighting fronts and in all the\r\nworkshops at home.  As I have said before, you cannot order up a\r\ngreat attack on a Monday and demand that it be delivered on\r\nSaturday.\r\n\r\nLess than a month ago I flew in a big Army transport plane over the\r\nlittle town of Bethlehem, in Palestine.\r\n\r\nTonight, on Christmas Eve, all men and women everywhere who love\r\nChristmas are thinking of that ancient town and of the star of\r\nfaith that shone there more than nineteen centuries ago.\r\n\r\nAmerican boys are fighting today in snow-covered mountains, in\r\nmalarial jungles, on blazing deserts; they are fighting on the far\r\nstretches of the sea and above the clouds, and fighting for the\r\nthing for which they struggle.  I think it is best symbolized by the\r\nmessage that came out of Bethlehem.\r\n\r\nOn behalf of the American people--your own people--I send this\r\nChristmas message to you, to you who are in our armed forces:\r\n\r\nIn our hearts are prayers for you and for all your comrades in arms\r\nwho fight to rid the world of evil.\r\n\r\nWe ask God's blessing upon you--upon your fathers, mothers, wives\r\nand children--all your loved ones at home.\r\n\r\nWe ask that the comfort of God's grace shall be granted to those\r\nwho are sick and wounded, and to those who are prisoners of war in\r\nthe hands of the enemy, waiting for the day when they will again be\r\nfree.\r\n\r\nAnd we ask that God receive and cherish those who have given their\r\nlives, and that He keep them in honor and in the grateful memory of\r\ntheir countrymen forever.\r\n\r\nGod bless all of you who fight our battles on this Christmas Eve.\r\n\r\nGod bless us all.  Keep us strong in our faith that we fight for a\r\nbetter day for humankind--here and everywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJune 5, 1944.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Friends:\r\n\r\nYesterday, on June fourth, 1944, Rome fell to American and Allied\r\ntroops.  The first of the Axis capitals is now in our hands.  One up\r\nand two to go!\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps significant that the first of these capitals to fall\r\nshould have the longest history of all of them.  The story of Rome\r\ngoes back to the time of the foundations of our civilization.  We\r\ncan still see there monuments of the time when Rome and the Romans\r\ncontrolled the whole of the then known world.  That, too, is\r\nsignificant, for the United Nations are determined that in the\r\nfuture no one city and no one race will be able to control the\r\nwhole of the world.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the monuments of the older times, we also see in\r\nRome the great symbol of Christianity, which has reached into\r\nalmost every part of the world.  There are other shrines and other\r\nchurches in many places, but the churches and shrines of Rome are\r\nvisible symbols of the faith and determination of the early saints\r\nand martyrs that Christianity should live and become universal.  And\r\ntonight it will be a source of deep satisfaction that the freedom\r\nof the Pope and the Vatican City is assured by the armies of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\n\r\nIt is also significant that Rome has been liberated by the armed\r\nforces of many nations.  The American and British armies--who bore\r\nthe chief burdens of battle--found at their sides our own North\r\nAmerican neighbors, the gallant Canadians.  The fighting New\r\nZealanders from the far South Pacific, the courageous French and\r\nthe French Moroccans, the South Africans, the Poles and the East\r\nIndians--all of them fought with us on the bloody approaches to the\r\ncity of Rome.\r\n\r\nThe Italians, too, forswearing a partnership in the Axis which they\r\nnever desired, have sent their troops to join us in our battles\r\nagainst the German trespassers on their soil.\r\n\r\nThe prospect of the liberation of Rome meant enough to Hitler and\r\nhis generals to induce them to fight desperately at great cost of\r\nmen and materials and with great sacrifice to their crumbling\r\nEastern line and to their Western front.  No thanks are due to them\r\nif Rome was spared the devastation which the Germans wreaked on\r\nNaples and other Italian cities.  The Allied general maneuvered so\r\nskillfully that the Nazis could only have stayed long enough to\r\ndamage Rome at the risk of losing their armies.\r\n\r\nBut Rome is of course more than a military objective.\r\n\r\nEver since before the days of the Caesars, Rome has stood as a\r\nsymbol of authority.  Rome was the Republic.  Rome was the Empire.\r\nRome was and is in a sense the Catholic Church, and Rome was the\r\ncapital of a United Italy.  Later, unfortunately, a quarter of a\r\ncentury ago, Rome became the seat of Fascism--one of the three\r\ncapitals of the Axis.\r\n\r\nFor this quarter century the Italian people were enslaved.  They\r\nwere degraded by the rule of Mussolini from Rome.  They will mark\r\nits liberation with deep emotion.  In the north of Italy, the people\r\nare still dominated and threatened by the Nazi overlords and their\r\nFascist puppets.\r\n\r\nOur victory comes at an excellent time, while our Allied forces are\r\npoised for another strike at western Europe--and while the armies\r\nof other Nazi soldiers nervously await our assault.  And in the\r\nmeantime our gallant Russian Allies continue to make their power\r\nfelt more and more.\r\n\r\nFrom a strictly military standpoint, we had long ago accomplished\r\ncertain of the main objectives of our Italian campaign--the control\r\nof the islands--the major islands--the control of the sea lanes of\r\nthe Mediterranean to shorten our combat and supply lines, and the\r\ncapture of the airports, such as the great airports of Foggia,\r\nsouth of Rome, from which we have struck telling blows on the\r\ncontinent--the whole of the continent all the way up to the Russian\r\nfront.\r\n\r\nIt would be unwise to inflate in our own minds the military\r\nimportance of the capture of Rome.  We shall have to push through a\r\nlong period of greater effort and fiercer fighting before we get\r\ninto Germany itself.  The Germans have retreated thousands of miles,\r\nall the way from the gates of Cairo, through Libya and Tunisia and\r\nSicily and Southern Italy.  They have suffered heavy losses, but not\r\ngreat enough yet to cause collapse.\r\n\r\nGermany has not yet been driven to surrender.  Germany has not yet\r\nbeen driven to the point where she will be unable to recommence\r\nworld conquest a generation hence.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the victory still lies some distance ahead.  That\r\ndistance will be covered in due time--have no fear of that.  But it\r\nwill be tough and it will be costly, as I have told you many, many\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nIn Italy the people had lived so long under the corrupt rule of\r\nMussolini that, in spite of the tinsel at the top--you have seen\r\nthe pictures of him--their economic condition had grown steadily\r\nworse.  Our troops have found starvation, malnutrition, disease, a\r\ndeteriorating education and lowered public health--all by-products\r\nof the Fascist misrule.\r\n\r\nThe task of the Allies in occupation has been stupendous.  We have\r\nhad to start at the very bottom, assisting local governments to\r\nreform on democratic lines.  We have had to give them bread to\r\nreplace that which was stolen out of their mouths by the Germans.\r\nWe have had to make it possible for the Italians to raise and use\r\ntheir own local crops.  We have to help them cleanse their schools\r\nof Fascist trappings.\r\n\r\nI think the American people as a whole approve the salvage of these\r\nhuman beings, who are only now learning to walk in a new atmosphere\r\nof freedom.\r\n\r\nSome of us may let our thoughts run to the financial cost of it.\r\nEssentially it is what we can call a form of relief.  And at the\r\nsame time, we hope that this relief will be an investment for the\r\nfuture--an investment that will pay dividends by eliminating\r\nFascism, by ending any Italian desires to start another war of\r\naggression in the future.  And that means that they are dividends\r\nwhich justify such an investment, because they are additional\r\nsupports for world peace.\r\n\r\nThe Italian people are capable of self-government.  We do not lose\r\nsight of their virtues as a peace-loving nation.\r\n\r\nWe remember the many centuries in which the Italians were leaders\r\nin the arts and sciences, enriching the lives of all mankind.\r\n\r\nWe remember the great sons of the Italian people--Galileo and\r\nMarconi, Michelangelo and Dante--and incidentally that fearless\r\ndiscoverer who typifies the courage of Italy--Christopher Columbus.\r\n\r\nItaly cannot grow in stature by seeking to build up a great\r\nmilitaristic empire.  Italians have been overcrowded within their\r\nown territories, but they do not need to try to conquer the lands\r\nof other peoples in order to find the breath of life.  Other peoples\r\nmay not want to be conquered.\r\n\r\nIn the past, Italians have come by the millions into the United\r\nStates.  They have been welcomed, they have prospered, they have\r\nbecome good citizens, community and governmental leaders.  They are\r\nnot Italian-Americans.  They are Americans--Americans of Italian\r\ndescent.\r\n\r\nThe Italians have gone in great numbers to the other Americas--\r\nBrazil and the Argentine, for example--hundreds and hundreds of\r\nthousands of them.  They have gone to many other nations in every\r\ncontinent of the world, giving of their industry and their talents,\r\nand achieving success and the comfort of good living, and good\r\ncitizenship.\r\n\r\nItaly should go on as a great mother nation, contributing to the\r\nculture and the progress and the good will of all mankind--\r\ndeveloping her special talents in the arts and crafts and sciences,\r\nand preserving her historic and cultural heritage for the benefit\r\nof all peoples.\r\n\r\nWe want and expect the help of the future Italy toward lasting\r\npeace.  All the other nations opposed to Fascism and Nazism ought to\r\nhelp to give Italy a chance.\r\n\r\nThe Germans, after years of domination in Rome, left the people in\r\nthe Eternal City on the verge of starvation.  We and the British\r\nwill do and are doing everything we can to bring them relief.\r\nAnticipating the fall of Rome, we made preparations to ship food\r\nsupplies to the city, but, of course, it should be borne in mind\r\nthat the needs are so great, the transportation requirements of our\r\narmies so heavy, that improvement must be gradual.  But we have\r\nalready begun to save the lives of the men, women and children of\r\nRome.\r\n\r\nThis, I think, is an example of the efficiency of your machinery of\r\nwar.  The magnificent ability and energy of the American people in\r\ngrowing the crops, building the merchant ships, in making and\r\ncollecting the cargoes, in getting the supplies over thousands of\r\nmiles of water, and thinking ahead to meet emergencies--all this\r\nspells, I think, an amazing efficiency on the part of our armed\r\nforces, all the various agencies working with them, and American\r\nindustry and labor as a whole.\r\n\r\nNo great effort like this can be a hundred percent perfect, but the\r\nbatting average is very, very high.\r\n\r\nAnd so I extend the congratulations and thanks tonight of the\r\nAmerican people to General Alexander, who has been in command of\r\nthe whole Italian operation; to our General Clark and General Leese\r\nof the Fifth and the Eighth Armies; to General Wilson, the Supreme\r\nAllied commander of the Mediterranean theater, to General Devers,\r\nhis American Deputy; to General Eaker; to Admirals Cunningham and\r\nHewitt; and to all their brave officers and men.\r\n\r\nMay God bless them and watch over them and over all of our gallant,\r\nfighting men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJune 23, 1944.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll our fighting men overseas today have their appointed stations\r\non the far-flung battlefronts of the world.  We at home have ours\r\ntoo.  We need, we are proud of, our fighting men--most decidedly.\r\nBut, during the anxious times ahead, let us not forget that they\r\nneed us too.\r\n\r\nIt goes almost without saying that we must continue to forge the\r\nweapons of victory--the hundreds of thousands of items, large and\r\nsmall, essential to the waging of war.  This has been the major task\r\nfrom the very start, and it is still a major task.  This is the very\r\nworst time for any war worker to think of leaving his machine or to\r\nlook for a peacetime job.\r\n\r\nAnd it goes almost without saying, too, that we must continue to\r\nprovide our government with the funds necessary for waging war not\r\nonly by the payment of taxes--which, after all, is an obligation of\r\nAmerican citizenship--but also by the purchase of war bonds--an act\r\nof free choice which every citizen has to make for himself under\r\nthe guidance of his own conscience.\r\n\r\nWhatever else any of us may be doing, the purchase of war bonds and\r\nstamps is something all of us can do and should do to help win the\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nI am happy to report tonight that it is something which nearly\r\neveryone seems to be doing.  Although there are now approximately\r\nsixty-seven million persons who have or earn some form of income,\r\neighty-one million persons or their children have already bought\r\nwar bonds.  They have bought more than six hundred million\r\nindividual bonds.  Their purchases have totaled more than thirty-two\r\nbillion dollars.  These are the purchases of individual men, women,\r\nand children.  Anyone who would have said this was possible a few\r\nyears ago would have been put down as a starry-eyed visionary.  But\r\nof such visions is the stuff of America fashioned.\r\n\r\nOf course, there are always pessimists with us everywhere, a few\r\nhere and a few there.  I am reminded of the fact that after the fall\r\nof France in 1940 I asked the Congress for the money for the\r\nproduction by the United States of fifty thousand airplanes that\r\nyear.  Well, I was called crazy--it was said that the figure was\r\nfantastic; that it could not be done.  And yet today we are building\r\nairplanes at the rate of one hundred thousand a year.\r\n\r\nThere is a direct connection between the bonds you have bought and\r\nthe stream of men and equipment now rushing over the English\r\nChannel for the liberation of Europe.  There is a direct connection\r\nbetween your bonds and every part of this global war today.\r\n\r\nTonight, therefore, on the opening of this Fifth War Loan Drive, it\r\nis appropriate for us to take a broad look at this panorama of\r\nworld war, for the success or the failure of the drive is going to\r\nhave so much to do with the speed with which we can accomplish\r\nvictory and the peace.\r\n\r\nWhile I know that the chief interest tonight is centered on the\r\nEnglish Channel and on the beaches and farms and the cities of\r\nNormandy, we should not lose sight of the fact that our armed\r\nforces are engaged on other battlefronts all over the world, and\r\nthat no one front can be considered alone without its proper\r\nrelation to all.\r\n\r\nIt is worth while, therefore, to make over-all comparisons with the\r\npast.  Let us compare today with just two years ago--June, 1942.  At\r\nthat time Germany was in control of practically all of Europe, and\r\nwas steadily driving the Russians back toward the Ural Mountains.\r\nGermany was practically in control of North Africa and the\r\nMediterranean, and was beating at the gates of the Suez Canal and\r\nthe route to India.  Italy was still an important military and\r\nsupply factor--as subsequent, long campaigns have proved.\r\n\r\nJapan was in control of the western Aleutian Islands; and in the\r\nSouth Pacific was knocking at the gates of Australia and New\r\nZealand--and also was threatening India.  Japan had seized control\r\nof most of the Central Pacific.\r\n\r\nAmerican armed forces on land and sea and in the air were still\r\nvery definitely on the defensive, and in the building-up stage.  Our\r\nallies were bearing the heat and the brunt of the attack.\r\n\r\nIn 1942 Washington heaved a sigh of relief that the first war bond\r\nissue had been cheerfully oversubscribed by the American people.\r\nWay back in those days, two year ago, America was still hearing\r\nfrom many \"amateur strategists\" and political critics, some of whom\r\nwere doing more good for Hitler than for the United States--two\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\nBut today we are on the offensive all over the world--bringing the\r\nattack to our enemies.\r\n\r\nIn the Pacific, by relentless submarine and naval attacks, and\r\namphibious thrusts, and ever-mounting air attack, we have deprived\r\nthe Japs of the power to check the momentum of our ever-growing and\r\never-advancing military forces.  We have reduced the Japs' shipping\r\nby more than three million tons.  We have overcome their original\r\nadvantage in the air.  We have cut off from a return to the homeland\r\ntens of thousands of beleaguered Japanese troops who now face\r\nstarvation or ultimate surrender.  And we have cut down their naval\r\nstrength, so that for many months they have avoided all risk of\r\nencounter with our naval forces.\r\n\r\nTrue, we still have a long way to go to Tokyo.  But, carrying out\r\nour original strategy of eliminating our European enemy first and\r\nthen turning all our strength to the Pacific, we can force the\r\nJapanese to unconditional surrender or to national suicide much\r\nmore rapidly than has been thought possible.\r\n\r\nTurning now to our enemy who is first on the list for destruction--\r\nGermany has her back against the wall-- in fact three walls at\r\nonce!\r\n\r\nIn the south--we have broken the German hold on central Italy.  On\r\nJune 4, the city of Rome fell to the Allied armies.  And allowing\r\nthe enemy no respite, the Allies are now pressing hard on the heels\r\nof the Germans as they retreat northwards in ever-growing\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\nOn the east--our gallant Soviet allies have driven the enemy back\r\nfrom the lands which were invaded three years ago.  The great Soviet\r\narmies are now initiating crushing blows.\r\n\r\nOverhead--vast Allied air fleets of bombers and fighters have been\r\nwaging a bitter air war over Germany and Western Europe.  They have\r\nhad two major objectives:  to destroy German war industries which\r\nmaintain the German armies and air forces; and to shoot the German\r\nLuftwaffe out of the air.  As a result, German production has been\r\nwhittled down continuously, and the German fighter forces now have\r\nonly a fraction of their former power.\r\n\r\nThis great air campaign, strategic and tactical, is going to\r\ncontinue--with increasing power.\r\n\r\nAnd on the west--the hammer blow which struck the coast of France\r\nlast Tuesday morning, less than a week ago, was the culmination of\r\nmany months of careful planning and strenuous preparation.\r\n\r\nMillions of tons of weapons and supplies, and hundreds of thousands\r\nof men assembled in England, are now being poured into the great\r\nbattle in Europe.\r\n\r\nI think that from the standpoint of our enemy we have achieved the\r\nimpossible.  We have broken through their supposedly impregnable\r\nwall in northern France.  But the assault has been costly in men and\r\ncostly in materials.  Some of our landings were desperate\r\nadventures; but from advices received so far, the losses were lower\r\nthan our commanders had estimated would occur.  We have established\r\na firm foothold.  We are now prepared to meet the inevitable\r\ncounterattacks of the Germans-- with power and with confidence.  And\r\nwe all pray that we will have far more, soon, than a firm foothold.\r\n\r\nAmericans have all worked together to make this day possible.\r\n\r\nThe liberation forces now streaming across the Channel, and up the\r\nbeaches and through the fields and the forests of France are using\r\nthousands and thousands of planes and ships and tanks and heavy\r\nguns.  They are carrying with them many thousands of items needed\r\nfor their dangerous, stupendous undertaking.  There is a shortage of\r\nnothing--nothing!  And this must continue.\r\n\r\nWhat has been done in the United States since those days of 1940--\r\nwhen France fell--in raising and equipping and transporting our\r\nfighting forces, and in producing weapons and supplies for war, has\r\nbeen nothing short of a miracle.  It was largely due to American\r\nteamwork-- teamwork among capital and labor and agriculture,\r\nbetween the armed forces and the civilian economy--indeed among all\r\nof them.\r\n\r\nAnd every one--every man or woman or child--who bought a war bond\r\nhelped--and helped mightily!\r\n\r\nThere are still many people in the United States who have not\r\nbought war bonds, or who have not bought as many as they can\r\nafford.  Everyone knows for himself whether he falls into that\r\ncategory or not.  In some cases his neighbors know too.  To the\r\nconsciences of those people, this appeal by the President of the\r\nUnited States is very much in order.\r\n\r\nFor all of the things which we use in this war, everything we send\r\nto our fighting allies, costs money--a lot of money.  One sure way\r\nevery man, woman, and child can keep faith with those who have\r\ngiven, and are giving, their lives, is to provide the money which\r\nis needed to win the final victory.\r\n\r\nI urge all Americans to buy war bonds without stint.  Swell the\r\nmighty chorus to bring us nearer to victory!",
