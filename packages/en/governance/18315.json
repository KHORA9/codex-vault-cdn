If the Nabob ever wrote to Mr. Hastings,\r\nexpressing a request or desire for this meeting, his letter was\r\nunquestionably dictated to him by the prisoner. We have laid a ground of\r\ndirect proof before you, that the Nabob's being at Chunar, that his\r\nproceedings there, and that all his acts were so dictated, and\r\nconsequently must be so construed.\r\n\r\nI shall now proceed to lay before your Lordships the acts of oppression\r\ncommitted by Mr. Hastings through his two miserable instruments: the\r\none, his passive instrument, the Nabob; the other, Mr. Middleton, his\r\nactive instrument, in his subsequent plans for the entire destruction of\r\nthat country. In page 513 of the printed Minutes you have Mr.\r\nMiddleton's declaration of his promptitude to represent everything\r\nagreeably to Mr. Hastings's wishes.\r\n\r\n     \"My dear Sir,--I have this day answered your public letter in the\r\n     form you seemed to expect. I hope there is nothing in it that may\r\n     to you appear too pointed. If you wish the matter to be otherwise\r\n     understood than I have taken up and stated it, I need not say I\r\n     shall be ready to conform to whatever you may prescribe, and to\r\n     take upon myself any share of the blame of the hitherto\r\n     non-performance of the stipulations made on behalf of the Nabob;\r\n     though I do assure you I myself represented to his Excellency and\r\n     the ministers, conceiving it to be your desire, that the apparent\r\n     assumption of the reins of his government, (for in that light he\r\n     undoubtedly considered it at the first view,) as specified in the\r\n     agreement executed by him, was not meant to be fully and literally\r\n     enforced, but that it was necessary you should have something to\r\n     show on your side, as the Company were deprived of a benefit\r\n     without a requital; and upon the faith of this assurance alone, I\r\n     believe I may safely affirm, his Excellency's objections to signing\r\n     the treaty were given up. If I have understood the matter wrong, or\r\n     misconceived your design, I am truly sorry for it. However, it is\r\n     not too late to correct the error; and I am ready to undertake,\r\n     and, God willing, to carry through, whatever you may, on the\r\n     receipt of my public letter, tell me is your final resolve.\r\n\r\n     \"If you determine, at all events, that the measures of reducing the\r\n     Nabob's army, &c., shall be immediately undertaken, I shall take it\r\n     as a particular favor, if you will indulge me with a line at\r\n     Fyzabad, that I may make the necessary previous arrangements with\r\n     respect to the disposal of my family, which I would not wish to\r\n     retain here, in the event either of a rupture with the Nabob, or\r\n     the necessity of employing our forces on the reduction of his\r\n     aumils and troops. This done, I can begin the work in three days\r\n     after my return from Fyzabad.\"\r\n\r\nBesides this letter, which I think is sufficiently clear upon the\r\nsubject, there is also another much more clear upon your Lordships'\r\nminutes, much more distinct and much more pointed, expressive of his\r\nbeing resolved to make such representations of every matter as the\r\nGovernor-General may wish. Now a man who is master of the manner in\r\nwhich facts are represented, and whose subsequent conduct is to be\r\njustified by such representations, is not simply accountable for his\r\nconduct; he is accountable for culpably attempting to form, on false\r\npremises, the judgment of others upon that conduct. This species of\r\ndelinquency must therefore be added to the rest; and I wish your\r\nLordships to carry generally in your minds, that there is not one single\r\nsyllable of representation made by any of those parties, except where\r\ntruth may happen to break out in spite of all the means of concealment,\r\nwhich is not to be considered as the representation of Mr. Hastings\r\nhimself in justification of his own conduct.\r\n\r\nThe letter which I have just now read was written preparatory to the\r\ntransaction which I am now going to state, called _the treaty of\r\nChunar_. Having brought his miserable victim thither, he forced him to\r\nsign a paper called a treaty: but such was the fraud in every part of\r\nthis treaty, that Mr. Middleton himself, who was the instrument and the\r\nchief agent in it, acknowledges that the Nabob was persuaded to sign it\r\nby the assurance given to him that it never was to be executed. Here,\r\nthen, your Lordships have a prince first compelled to enter into a\r\nnegotiation, and then induced to accede to a treaty by false assurances\r\nthat it should not be executed, which he declares nothing but force\r\nshould otherwise have compelled him to accede to.\r\n\r\nThe first circumstance in this transaction that I shall lay before your\r\nLordships is that the treaty is declared to have for its objects two\r\nmodes of relieving the Nabob from his distresses,--from distresses which\r\nwe have stated, and which Mr. Hastings has not only fully admitted, but\r\nhas himself proved in the clearest manner to your Lordships. The first\r\nwas by taking away that _wicked rabble_, the British troops, represented\r\nby Mr. Hastings as totally ruinous to the Nabob's affairs, and\r\nparticularly by removing that part of them which was called the new\r\nbrigade. Another remedial part of the treaty regarded the British\r\npensioners. It is in proof before your Lordships that Mr. Hastings\r\nagreed to recall from Oude that body of pensioners, whose conduct there\r\nis described in such strong terms as being ruinous to the Vizier and to\r\nall his affairs. These pensioners Mr. Hastings engaged to recall; but he\r\nnever did recall them. We refer your Lordships to the evidence before\r\nyou, in proof that these odious pensioners, so distressing to the Nabob,\r\nso ruinous to his affairs, and so disgraceful to our government, were\r\nnot only _not_ recalled by Mr. Hastings, but that, both afterwards, and\r\nupon the very day of signing the treaty, (as Mr. Middleton himself tells\r\nyou,) upon that very day, I say, he recommended to the Nabob that these\r\npensioners might remain upon that very establishment which, by a solemn\r\ntreaty of his own making and his own dictating, he had agreed to\r\nrelieve from this intolerable burden.\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings, your Lordships will remember, had departed from Benares,\r\nfrustrated in his designs of extorting 500,000_l._ from the Rajah for\r\nthe Company's use. He had ravaged the country, without obtaining any\r\nbenefit for his masters: the British soldiers having divided the only\r\nspoil, and nothing remaining for the share of his employers but\r\ndisgrace. He was therefore afraid to return without having something of\r\na lucrative pecuniary nature to exhibit to the Company. Having this\r\nobject in view, Oude appears to have first presented itself to his\r\nnotice, as a country from which some advantage of a pecuniary kind might\r\nbe derived; and accordingly he turned in his head a vast variety of\r\nstratagems for effecting his purpose.\r\n\r\nThe first article that occurs in the treaty of Chunar is a power given\r\nto the Nabob to resume all the jaghires not guarantied by the Company,\r\nand to give pensions to all those persons who should be removed from\r\ntheir jaghires.\r\n\r\nNow the first thing which would naturally occur to a man, who was going\r\nto raise a revenue through the intervention of the prince of the\r\ncountry, would be to recommend to that prince a better economy in his\r\naffairs, and a rational and equal assessment upon his subjects, in order\r\nto furnish the amount of the demand which he was about to make upon him.\r\nI need not tell your Lordships, trained and formed as your minds are to\r\nthe rules and orders of good government, that there is no way by which a\r\nprince can justly assess his subjects but by assessing them all in\r\nproportion to their respective abilities, and that, if a prince should\r\nmake such a body as the House of Lords in this kingdom (which comes\r\nnear the case I am going to state) separately the subject of assessment,\r\nsuch a thing would be contrary to all the principles of regular and just\r\ntaxation in any country in the universe. Some men may possibly, by\r\nlocality or privileges, be excepted from certain taxes, but no taxation\r\never can be just that is thrown upon some particular class only; and if\r\nthat class happen to be small and the demand great, the injustice done\r\nis directly proportionable to the greatness of the exaction, and\r\ninversely to the number of the persons who are the objects of it: these\r\nare clear, irrefragable, and eternal principles. But if, instead of\r\nexacting a part by a proportionable rate, the prince should go further\r\nand attempt to shake the whole mass of property itself, a mass perhaps\r\nnot much less than that which is possessed by the whole peers of Great\r\nBritain, by confiscating the whole of the estates at once, as a\r\ngovernment resource, without the charge or pretence of any crime, I say\r\nthat such an act would be oppressive, cruel, and wicked in the highest\r\ndegree. Yet this is what Mr. Hastings projected, and actually did\r\naccomplish.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, at the treaty of Chunar, as it is called, Mr. Hastings (for he\r\nalways artfully feels his way as he proceeds) first says, that the Nabob\r\nshall be permitted to do this act, if he pleases. He does not assume the\r\ngovernment. He does not compel the Nabob to do anything. He does not\r\nforce upon him this abandoned and wicked confiscation of the property of\r\nthe whole nobility of a great country. All that he says is this,--\"The\r\nNabob _may be permitted_ to resume these jaghires.\" Why permitted? If\r\nthe act had been legal, proper, and justifiable, he did not want our\r\npermission; he was a sovereign in his own dominions. But Mr. Hastings\r\nrecollected that some of these jaghires (as they are called, and on\r\nwhich I shall say a very few words to your Lordships) were guarantied by\r\nthe Company. The jaghires of his own house, of his mother and\r\ngrandmother, were guarantied by us. I must inform your Lordships, that,\r\nupon some of our other exactions at an earlier period, the Nabob had\r\nendeavored to levy a forced loan upon the jaghiredars. This forced loan\r\nwas made and submitted to by those people upon a direct assurance of\r\ntheir rights in the jaghires, which right was guarantied by the British\r\nResident, not only to the Begums, and to the whole family of the Nabob,\r\nbut also to all the other objects of the tax.\r\n\r\nBefore I proceed, I will beg leave to state to you briefly the nature of\r\nthese jaghires. The jaghiredars, the holders of jaghires, form the body\r\nof the principal Mahometan nobility. The great nobility of that country\r\nare divided into two parts. One part consists of the zemindars, who are\r\nthe ancient proprietors of land, and the hereditary nobility of the\r\ncountry: these are mostly Gentoos. The Mahometans form the other part,\r\nwhose whole interest in the land consists in the jaghires: for very few\r\nindeed of them are zemindars anywhere, in some of the provinces none of\r\nthem are so; the whole of them are jaghiredars.\r\n\r\nWe have heard, my Lords, much discussion about jaghires. It is in proof\r\nbefore your Lordships that they are of two sorts: that a jaghire\r\nsignifies exactly what the word _fee_ does in the English language, or\r\n_feodum_ in the barbarous Latin of the Feudists; that it is a word which\r\nsignifies a salary or a maintenance, as did originally the English word\r\n_fee_, derived from the word _feod_ and _feodum_. These jaghires, like\r\nother fees and like other feods, were given in land, as a maintenance:\r\nsome with the condition of service, some without any condition; some\r\nwere annexed to an office, some were granted as the support of a\r\ndignity, and none were granted for a less term than life, except those\r\nthat were immediately annexed to a lease. We have shown your Lordships\r\n(and in this we have followed the example of Mr. Hastings) that some of\r\nthem are fees granted actually in perpetuity; and in fact many of them\r\nare so granted. We are farther to tell your Lordships, that by the\r\ncustom of the empire they are almost all grown, as the feods in Europe\r\nare grown, by use, into something which is at least virtually an\r\ninheritance. This is the state of the jaghires and jaghiredars.\r\n\r\nAmong these jaghires we find, what your Lordships would expect to find,\r\nan ample provision for all the nobility of that illustrious family of\r\nwhich the Nabob is the head: a prince whose family, both by father and\r\nmother, notwithstanding the slander of the prisoner against his\r\nbenefactor, was undoubtedly of the first and most distinguished nobility\r\nof the Mahometan empire. Accordingly, his uncles, all his near\r\nrelations, his mother, grandmother, all possessed jaghires, some of very\r\nlong standing, and most of them not given by the Nabob.\r\n\r\nI take some pains in explaining this business, because I trust your\r\nLordships will have a strong feeling against any confiscation for the\r\npurpose of revenue. Believe me, my Lords, if there is anything which\r\nwill root the present order of things out of Europe, it will begin, as\r\nwe see it has already begun in a neighboring country, by confiscating,\r\nfor the purposes of the state, grants made to classes of men, let them\r\nbe held by what names or be supposed susceptible of what abuses soever.\r\nI will venture to say that Jacobinism never can strike a more deadly\r\nblow against property, rank, and dignity than your Lordships, if you\r\nwere to acquit this man, would strike against your own dignity, and the\r\nvery being of the society in which we live.\r\n\r\nYour Lordships will find in your printed Minutes who the jaghiredars\r\nwere, and what was the amount of their estates. The jaghires of which\r\nMr. Hastings authorized the confiscation, or what he calls a\r\n_resumption_, appear from Mr. Purling's account, when first the forced\r\nloan was levied upon them under his Residentship, to amount to\r\n285,000_l._ sterling per annum; which 285,000_l._, if rated and valued\r\naccording to the different value of provisions and other necessaries of\r\nlife in that country and in England, will amount, as near as may be, to\r\nabout 600,000_l._ a year. I am within compass. Everybody conversant with\r\nIndia will say it is equivalent at least to 600,000_l._ a year in\r\nEngland; and what a blow such a confiscation as this would be on the\r\nfortunes of the peers of Great Britain your Lordships will judge. I like\r\nto see your estates as great as they are; I wish they were greater than\r\nthey are; but whatever they are, I wish, above all that they should be\r\nperpetual. For dignity and property in this country, _Esto perpetua_\r\nshall be my prayer this day, and the last prayer of my life. The\r\nCommons, therefore, of Great Britain, those guardians of property, who\r\nwill not suffer the monarch they love, the government which they adore,\r\nto levy one shilling upon the subject in any other way than the law and\r\nstatutes of this kingdom prescribe, will not suffer, nor can they bear\r\nthe idea, that any single class of people should be chosen to be the\r\nobjects of a contrary conduct, nor that even the Nabob of Oude should be\r\npermitted to act upon such a flagitious principle. When an English\r\ngovernor has substituted a power of his own instead of the legal\r\ngovernment of the country, as I have proved this man to have done, if he\r\nfound the prince going to do an act which would shake the property of\r\nall the nobility of the country, he surely ought to raise his hand and\r\nsay, \"You shall not make my name your sanction for such an atrocious and\r\nabominable act as this confiscation would be.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings, however, whilst he gives, with an urbanity for which he is\r\nso much praised, his consent to this confiscation, adds, there must be\r\npensions secured for all persons losing their estates, who had the\r\nsecurity of our guaranty. Your Lordships know that Mr. Hastings, by his\r\nguaranty, had secured their jaghires to the Nabob's own relations and\r\nfamily. One would have imagined, that, if the estates of those who were\r\nwithout any security were to be confiscated at his pleasure, those at\r\nleast who were guarantied by the Company, such as the Begums of Oude and\r\nseveral of the principal nobility of the Nabob's family, would have been\r\nsecure. He, indeed, says that pensions shall be given them; for at this\r\ntime he had not got the length of violating, without shame or remorse,\r\nall the guaranties of the Company. \"There shall,\" says he, \"be pensions\r\ngiven.\" If pensions were to be given to the value of the estate, I ask,\r\nWhat has this violent act done? You shake the security of property, and,\r\ninstead of suffering a man to gather his own profits with his own hands,\r\nyou turn him into a pensioner upon the public treasury. I can conceive\r\nthat such a measure will render these persons miserable dependants\r\ninstead of independent nobility; but I cannot conceive what financial\r\nobject can be answered by paying that in pension which you are to\r\nreceive in revenue. This is directly contrary to financial economy. For\r\nwhen you stipulate to pay out of the treasury of government a certain\r\npension, and take upon you the receipts of an estate, you adopt a\r\nmeasure by which government is almost sure of being a loser. You charge\r\nit with a certain fixed sum, and, even upon a supposition that under the\r\nmanagement of the public the estate will be as productive as it was\r\nunder the management of its private owner, (a thing highly improbable,)\r\nyou take your chance of a reimbursement subject to all the extra\r\nexpense, and to all the accidents that may happen to a public revenue.\r\nThis confiscation could not, therefore, be justified as a measure of\r\neconomy; it must have been designed merely for the sake of shaking and\r\ndestroying the property of the country.\r\n\r\nThe whole transaction, my Lords, was an act of gross violence, ushered\r\nin by a gross fraud. It appears that no pensions were ever intended to\r\nbe paid; and this you will naturally guess would be the event, when such\r\na strange metamorphosis was to be made as that of turning a great landed\r\ninterest into a pensionary payment. As it could answer no other purpose,\r\nso it could be intended for no other, than that of getting possession of\r\nthese jaghires by fraud. This man, my Lords, cannot commit a robbery\r\nwithout indulging himself at the same time in the practice of his\r\nfavorite arts of fraud and falsehood.\r\n\r\nAnd here I must again remind your Lordships, that at the time of the\r\ntreaty of Chunar the jaghires were held in the following manner. Of the\r\n285,000_l._ a year which was to be confiscated, the old grants of Sujah\r\nDowlah, [and?] the grandfather of the Nabob, amounted to near two thirds\r\nof the whole, as you will find in the paper to which we refer you. By\r\nthis confiscation, therefore, the Nabob was authorized to _resume_\r\ngrants of which he had not been the grantor.\r\n\r\n    [_Mr. Burke here read the list of the jaghires._]\r\n\r\nNow, my Lords, you see that all these estates, except 25,782_l._ a year,\r\nwere either jaghires for the Nabob's own immediate family, settled by\r\nhis father upon his mother, and by his father's father upon his\r\ngrandmother, and upon Salar Jung, his uncle, or were the property of the\r\nmost considerable nobility, to the gross amount of 285,000_l._ Mr.\r\nHastings confesses that the Nabob reluctantly made the confiscation to\r\nthe extent proposed. Why? \"Because,\" says he, \"the orderlies, namely,\r\ncertain persons so called, subservient to his debaucheries, were persons\r\nwhom he wished to spare.\" Now I am to show you that this man, whatever\r\nfaults he may have in his private morals, (with which we have nothing at\r\nall to do,) has been slandered throughout by Mr. Hastings. Take his own\r\naccount of the matter. \"The Nabob,\" says he, \"would have confiscated all\r\nthe rest, except his orderlies, whom he would have spared; but I,\r\nfinding where his partiality lay, compelled him to sacrifice the whole;\r\nfor otherwise he would have sacrificed the good to save the bad:\r\nwhereas,\" says Mr. Hastings, \"in effect my principle was to sacrifice\r\nthe good, and at the same time to punish the bad.\" Now compare the\r\naccount he gives of the proceedings of Asoph ul Dowlah with his own.\r\nAsoph ul Dowlah, to save some unworthy persons who had jaghires, would,\r\nif left to his own discretion, have confiscated those only of the\r\ndeserving; while Mr. Hastings, to effect the inclusion of the worthless\r\nin the confiscation, confiscates the jaghires of the innocent and the\r\nvirtuous men of high rank, and of those who had all the ties of Nature\r\nto plead for the Nabob's forbearance, and reduced them to a state of\r\ndependency and degradation.\r\n\r\nNow, supposing these two villanous plans, neither of which your\r\nLordships can bear to hear the sound of, to stand equal in point of\r\nmorality, let us see how they stand in point of calculation. The\r\nunexceptionable part of the 285,000_l._ amounted to 260,000_l._ a year;\r\nwhereas, supposing every part of the new grants had been made to the\r\nmost unworthy persons, it only amounted to 25,000_l._ a year. Therefore,\r\nby his own account, given to you and to the Company, upon this occasion\r\nhe has confiscated 260,000_l._ a year, the property of innocent, if not\r\nof meritorious individuals, in order to punish by confiscation those who\r\nhad 25,000_l._ a year only. This is the account he gives you himself of\r\nhis honor, his justice, and his policy in these proceedings.\r\n\r\nBut, my Lords, he shall not escape so. It is in your minutes, that so\r\nfar was the Nabob from wishing to save the new exceptionable grants,\r\nthat, at the time of the forced loan I have mentioned, and also when the\r\nresumption was proposed, he was perfectly willing to give up every one\r\nof them, and desired only that his mother, his uncles, and his\r\nrelations, with other individuals, the prime of the Mahometan nobility\r\nof that country, should be spared. Is it not enough that this poor\r\nNabob, this wretched prince, is made a slave to the man now standing at\r\nyour bar, that he is made by him a shame and a scandal to his family,\r\nhis race, and his country, but he must be cruelly aspersed, and have\r\nfaults and crimes attributed to him that do not belong to him? I know\r\nnothing of his private character and conduct: Mr. Hastings, who deals in\r\nscandalous anecdotes, knows them: but I take it upon the face of Mr.\r\nPurling's assertion, and I say, that the Nabob would have consented to\r\nan arbitrary taxation of the jaghires, and would have given up to\r\nabsolute confiscation every man except those honorable persons I have\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner himself has called Mr. Wombwell to prove the names of those\r\ninfamous persons with a partiality for whom Mr. Hastings has aspersed\r\nthe Nabob, in order to lay the ground for the destruction of his family.\r\nThey amount to only six in number; and when we come to examine these\r\nsix, we find that their jaghires were perfectly contemptible. The list\r\nof the other jaghiredars, your Lordships see, fills up pages; and the\r\namount of their incomes I have already stated. Your Lordships now see\r\nhow inconsiderable, both in number and amount, were the culpable\r\njaghires, in the destruction of which he has involved the greater number\r\nand the meritorious. You see that the Nabob never did propose any\r\nexemption of the former at any time; that this was a slander and a\r\ncalumny on that unhappy man, in order to defend the violent acts of the\r\nprisoner, who has recourse to slander and calumny as a proper way to\r\ndefend violence, outrage, and wrongs.\r\n\r\nWe have now gone through the first stage of Mr. Hastings's confiscation\r\nof the estates of these unhappy people. When it came to be put in\r\nexecution, Mr. Middleton finds the Nabob reluctant in the greatest\r\ndegree to make this sacrifice of his family and of all his nobility. It\r\ntouched him in every way in which shame and sympathy can affect a man.\r\nHe falls at the feet of Mr. Middleton; he says, \"I signed the treaty of\r\nChunar upon an assurance that it was never meant to be put in force.\"\r\nMr. Middleton nevertheless proceeds; he sends the family of the Nabob\r\nout of the country; but he entertains fears of a general revolt as the\r\nconsequence of this tyrannical act, and refers the case back to Mr.\r\nHastings, who insists upon its being executed in its utmost extent. The\r\nNabob again remonstrates in the strongest manner; he begs, he prays, he\r\ndissembles, he delays. One day he pretends to be willing to submit, the\r\nnext he hangs back, just as the violence of Mr. Hastings or his own\r\nnatural feelings and principles of justice dragged him one way or\r\ndragged him another. Mr. Middleton, trembling, and under the awe of that\r\n_dreadful responsibility_ under which your Lordships may remember Mr.\r\nHastings had expressly laid him upon that occasion, ventures at once to\r\nusurp the Nabob's government. He usurped it openly and avowedly. He\r\ndeclared that he himself would issue his purwannahs as governor of the\r\ncountry, for the purpose of executing this abominable confiscation. He\r\nassumed, I say, to himself the government of the country, and Mr.\r\nHastings had armed him with a strong military force for that purpose; he\r\ndeclared he would order those troops to march for his support; he at\r\nlast got this reluctant, struggling Nabob to consent in the manner we\r\nhave described.\r\n\r\nI shall now read to your Lordships Mr. Middleton's letters, that you may\r\nhear these men with their own mouths describing their own acts, and that\r\nyour Lordships may then judge whether the highest tone and language of\r\ncrimination comes up to their own description of their own proceedings.\r\n\r\n        \"_Lucknow, the 6th of Dec., 1781._\r\n\r\n     \"Finding the Nabob wavering in his determination about the\r\n     resumption of the jaghires, I this day, in presence of, and with\r\n     the minister's concurrence, ordered the necessary purwannahs to be\r\n     written to the several aumils for that purpose, and it was my firm\r\n     resolution to have dispatched them this evening, with proper people\r\n     to see them punctually and implicitly carried into execution; but\r\n     before they were all transcribed, I received a message from the\r\n     Nabob, who had been informed by the minister of the resolution I\r\n     had taken, entreating that I would withhold the purwannahs till\r\n     to-morrow morning, when he would attend me, and afford me\r\n     satisfaction on this point. As the loss of a few hours in the\r\n     dispatch of the purwannahs appeared of little moment, and as it is\r\n     possible the Nabob, seeing that the business will at all events be\r\n     done, may make it an act of his own, I have consented to indulge\r\n     him in his request; but, be the result of our interview whatever it\r\n     may, nothing shall prevent the orders being issued to-morrow,\r\n     either by him or myself, with the concurrence of the ministers.\r\n     Your pleasure respecting the Begums I have learnt from Sir Elijah,\r\n     and the measure heretofore proposed will soon follow the resumption\r\n     of the jaghires; from both, or, indeed, from the former alone, I\r\n     have no doubt of the complete liquidation of the Company's\r\n     balance.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n       \"_Lucknow, the 7th Dec., 1781._\r\n\r\n     \"My dear Sir,--I had the honor to address you yesterday, informing\r\n     you of the steps I had taken in regard to the resumption of the\r\n     jaghires. This morning the Vizier came to me, according to his\r\n     agreement, but seemingly without any intention or desire to yield\r\n     me satisfaction on the subject under discussion; for, after a great\r\n     deal of conversation, consisting on his part of trifling evasion\r\n     and puerile excuses for withholding his assent to the measure,\r\n     though at the same time professing the most implicit submission to\r\n     your wishes, I found myself without any other resource than the one\r\n     of employing that exclusive authority with which I consider your\r\n     instructions to vest me. I therefore declared to the Nabob, in\r\n     presence of the minister and Mr. Johnson, who I desired might bear\r\n     witness of the conversation, that I construed his rejection of the\r\n     measure proposed as a breach of his solemn promise to you, and an\r\n     unwillingness to yield that assistance which was evidently in his\r\n     power towards liquidating his heavy accumulated debt to the\r\n     Company, and that I must in consequence determine, in my own\r\n     justification, to issue immediately the purwannahs, which had only\r\n     been withheld in the sanguine hope that he would be prevailed upon\r\n     to make that his own act, which nothing but the most urgent\r\n     necessity could force me to make mine. He left me without any\r\n     reply, but afterwards sent for his minister, and authorized him to\r\n     give me hopes that my requisition would be complied with; on which\r\n     I expressed my satisfaction, but declared that I could admit of no\r\n     further delays, and, unless I received his Excellency's formal\r\n     acquiescence before the evening, I should then most assuredly issue\r\n     my purwannahs: which I have accordingly done, not having had any\r\n     assurances from his Excellency that could justify a further\r\n     suspension. I shall as soon as possible inform you of the effect of\r\n     the purwannahs, which in many parts I am apprehensive it will be\r\n     found necessary to enforce with military aid; I am not, however,\r\n     entirely without hopes that the Nabob, when he sees the inefficacy\r\n     of further opposition, may alter his conduct, and prevent the\r\n     confusion and disagreeable consequences which would be too likely\r\n     to result from the prosecution of a measure of such importance\r\n     without his concurrence. His Excellency talks of going to Fyzabad,\r\n     for the purpose heretofore mentioned, in three or four days; I wish\r\n     he may be serious in this intention, and you may rest assured I\r\n     shall spare no pains to keep him to it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n       \"_Lucknow, 28th December, 1781._\r\n\r\n     \"If your new demand is to be insisted upon, which your letter seems\r\n     to portend, I must beg your precise orders upon it; as, from the\r\n     difficulties I have within these few days experienced in carrying\r\n     the points you had enjoined with the Nabob, I have the best grounds\r\n     for believing that he would consider it a direct breach of the late\r\n     agreement, and totally reject the proposal as such; and I must own\r\n     to you, that, in his present fermented state of mind, I could\r\n     expect nothing less than despair and a declared rupture.\r\n\r\n     \"He has by no means been yet able to furnish me with means of\r\n     paying off the arrears due to the temporary brigade, to the\r\n     stipulated term of its continuance in his service. The funds\r\n     necessary for paying off and discharging his own military\r\n     establishment under British officers, and his pension list, have\r\n     been raised, on the private credit of Mr. Johnson and myself, from\r\n     the shroffs of this place, to whom we are at this moment pledged\r\n     for many lacs of rupees; and without such aid, which I freely and\r\n     at all hazards yielded, because I conceived it was your anxious\r\n     desire to relieve the Nabob as soon as possible of this heavy\r\n     burden, the establishment must have been at his charge to this\r\n     time, and probably for months to come, while his resources were\r\n     strained to the utmost to furnish jaidads for its maintenance to\r\n     this period. I therefore hesitate not to declare it utterly\r\n     impossible for him, under any circumstances whatever, to provide\r\n     funds for the payment of the troops you now propose to send him.\r\n\r\n     \"The wresting Furruckabad, Kyraghur, and Fyzoola Khân's country\r\n     from his government, (for in that light, my dear Sir, I can\r\n     faithfully assure you, he views the measures adopted in respect to\r\n     those countries,) together with the resumption of all the jaghires,\r\n     so much against his inclination, have already brought the Nabob to\r\n     a persuasion that nothing less than his destruction, or the\r\n     annihilation of every shadow of his power, is meant; and all my\r\n     labors to convince him to the contrary have proved abortive. A\r\n     settled melancholy has seized him, and his health is reduced beyond\r\n     conception; and I do most humbly believe that the march of four\r\n     regiments of sepoys towards Lucknow, under whatever circumstances\r\n     it might be represented, would be considered by him as a force\r\n     ultimately to be used in securing his person. In short, my dear\r\n     Sir, it is a matter of such immediate moment, and involving,\r\n     apparently, such very serious and important consequences, that I\r\n     have not only taken upon me to suspend the communication of it to\r\n     the Nabob until I should be honored with your further commands, but\r\n     have also ventured to write the inclosed letter to Colonel Morgan:\r\n     liberties which I confidently trust you will excuse, when you\r\n     consider that I can be actuated by no other motive than a zeal for\r\n     the public service, and that, if, after all, you determine that the\r\n     measure shall be insisted on, it will be only the loss of six or at\r\n     most eight days in proposing it. But in the last event, I earnestly\r\n     entreat your orders may be explicit and positive, that I may\r\n     clearly know what lengths you would wish me to proceed in carrying\r\n     them into execution. I again declare it is my firm belief, and\r\n     assure yourself, my dear Mr. Hastings, I am not influenced in this\r\n     declaration by any considerations but my public duty and my\r\n     personal attachment to you, that the enforcing the measure you have\r\n     proposed would be productive of an open rupture between us and the\r\n     Nabob; nay, that the first necessary step towards carrying it into\r\n     effect must be, on our part, a declaration of hostility.\"\r\n\r\nYour Lordships have now before your eyes proofs, furnished by Mr.\r\nHastings himself from his correspondence with Mr. Middleton,\r\nirrefragable proofs, that this Nabob, who is stated to have made the\r\nproposition himself, was dragged to the signature of it; and that the\r\ntroops which are supposed, and fraudulently stated, (and I wish your\r\nLordships particularly to observe this,) to have been sent to assist\r\nhim in this measure, were considered by him as a body of troops sent to\r\nimprison him, and to free him from all the troubles and pains of\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Hastings sent the troops for the purpose, as he pretended, of\r\nassisting the Nabob in the execution of a measure which was really\r\nadopted in direct opposition to the wishes of that prince, what other\r\nconclusion could be drawn, but that they were sent to overawe, not to\r\nassist him? The march of alien troops into a country upon that occasion\r\ncould have no object but hostility; they could have been sent with no\r\nother design but that of bringing disgrace upon the Nabob, by making him\r\nthe instrument of his family's ruin, and of the destruction of his\r\nnobility. Your Lordships, therefore, will not wonder that this miserable\r\nman should have sunk into despair, and that he should have felt the\r\nweight of his oppression doubly aggravated by its coming from such a man\r\nas Mr. Hastings, and by its being enforced by such a man as Mr.\r\nMiddleton.\r\n\r\nAnd here I must press one observation upon your Lordships: I do not know\r\na greater insult that can be offered to a man born to command than to\r\nfind himself made the tool of a set of obscure men, come from an unknown\r\ncountry, without anything to distinguish them but an usurped power.\r\nNever shall I, out of compliment to any persons, because they happen to\r\nbe my own countrymen, disguise my feelings, or renounce the dictates of\r\nNature and of humanity. If we send out obscure people, unknowing and\r\nunknown, to exercise such acts as these, I must say it is a bitter\r\naggravation of the victim's suffering. Oppression and robbery are at all\r\ntimes evils; but they are more bearable, when exercised by persons whom\r\nwe have been habituated to regard with awe, and to whom mankind for ages\r\nhave been accustomed to bow.\r\n\r\nNow does the history of tyranny furnish, does the history of popular\r\nviolence deposing kings furnish, anything like the dreadful deposition\r\nof this prince, and the cruel and abominable tyranny that has been\r\nexercised over him? Consider, too, my Lords, for what object all this\r\nwas done. Was Mr. Hastings endeavoring, by his arbitrary interference\r\nand the use of his superior power, to screen a people from the\r\nusurpation and power of a tyrant,--from any strong and violent acts\r\nagainst property, against dignity, against nobility, against the freedom\r\nof his people? No: you see here a monarch deposed, in effect, by persons\r\npretending to be his allies, and assigning what are pretended to be his\r\nwishes as the motive for using his usurped authority in the execution of\r\nthese acts of violence against his own family and his subjects. You see\r\nhim struggling against this violent prostitution of his authority. He\r\nrefuses the sanction of his name, which before he had given up to Mr.\r\nHastings to be used as he pleased, and only begs not to be made an\r\ninstrument of wrong which his soul abhors, and which would make him\r\ninfamous throughout the world. Mr. Middleton, however, assumes the\r\nsovereignty of the country. \"I,\" he says, \"am Nabob of Oude: the\r\njaghires shall be confiscated: I have given my orders, and they shall be\r\nsupported by a military force.\"\r\n\r\nI am ashamed to have so far distrusted your Lordships' honorable and\r\ngenerous feelings as to have offered you, upon this occasion, any\r\nremarks which you must have run before me in making. Those feelings\r\nwhich you have, and ought to have, feelings born in the breasts of all\r\nmen, and much more in men of your Lordships' elevated rank, render my\r\nremarks unnecessary. I need not, therefore, ask what you feel, when a\r\nforeign resident at a prince's court takes upon himself to force that\r\nprince to act the part of a tyrant, and, upon his resistance, openly and\r\navowedly assumes the sovereignty of the country. You have it in proof\r\nthat Mr. Middleton did this. He not only put his own name to the orders\r\nfor this horrible confiscation, but he actually proceeded to dispossess\r\nthe jaghiredars of their lands, and to send them out of the country. And\r\nwhom does he send, in the place of this plundered body of nobility, to\r\ntake possession of the country? Why, the usurers of Benares. Yes, my\r\nLords, he immediately mortgages the whole country to the usurers of\r\nBenares, for the purpose of raising money upon it: giving it up to those\r\nbloodsuckers, dispossessed of that nobility, whose interest, whose duty,\r\nwhose feelings, and whose habits made them the natural protectors of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, we here see a body of usurers put into possession of all the\r\nestates of the nobility: let us now see if this act was necessary, even\r\nfor the avowed purposes of its agents,--the relief of the Nabob's\r\nfinancial difficulties, and the payment of his debts to the Company. Mr.\r\nMiddleton has told your Lordships that these jaghires would pay the\r\nCompany's debt completely in two years. Then would it not have been\r\nbetter to have left these estates in the hands of their owners, and to\r\nhave oppressed them in some moderate, decent way? Might they not have\r\nleft the jaghiredars to raise the sums required by some settlement with\r\nthe bankers of Benares, in which the repayment of the money within five\r\nor six years might have been secured, and the jaghiredars have had in\r\nthe mean time something to subsist upon? Oh, no! these victims must have\r\nnothing to live upon. They must be turned out. And why? Mr. Hastings\r\ncommands it.\r\n\r\nHere I must come in aid of Mr. Middleton a little; for one cannot but\r\npity the miserable instruments that have to act under Mr. Hastings. I do\r\nnot mean to apologize for Mr. Middleton, but to pity the situation of\r\npersons who, being servants of the Company, were converted, by the\r\nusurpation of this man, into his subjects and his slaves. The mind of\r\nMr. Middleton revolts. You see him reluctant to proceed. The Nabob begs\r\na respite. You find in the Resident a willingness to comply. Even Mr.\r\nMiddleton is placable. Mr. Hastings alone is obdurate. His resolution to\r\nrob and to destroy was not to be moved, and the estates of the whole\r\nMahometan nobility of a great kingdom were confiscated in a moment. Your\r\nLordships will observe that his orders to Mr. Middleton allow no\r\nforbearance. He writes thus to him.\r\n\r\n     \"Sir,--My mind has been for some days suspended between two\r\n     opposite impulses: one arising from the necessity of my return to\r\n     Calcutta; the other, from the apprehension of my presence being\r\n     more necessary and more urgently wanted at Lucknow. Your answer to\r\n     this shall decide my choice.\r\n\r\n     \"I have waited thus long in the hopes of hearing that some progress\r\n     had been made in the execution of the plan which I concluded with\r\n     the Nabob in September last. I do not find that any step towards\r\n     it has been yet taken, though three months are elapsed, and little\r\n     more than that period did appear to me requisite to have\r\n     accomplished the most essential parts of it, and to have brought\r\n     the whole into train. This tardiness, and the opposition prepared\r\n     to the only decided act yet undertaken, have a bad appearance. I\r\n     approve the Nabob's resolutions to deprive the Begums of their\r\n     ill-employed treasures. In both services, it must be your care to\r\n     prevent an abuse of the powers given to those that are employed in\r\n     them. You yourself ought to be personally present. You must not\r\n     allow any negotiation or forbearance, but must prosecute both\r\n     services, until the Begums are at the entire mercy of the Nabob,\r\n     their jaghires in the quiet possession of his aumils, and their\r\n     wealth in such charge as may secure it against private\r\n     embezzlement. You will have a force more than sufficient to effect\r\n     both these purposes.\r\n\r\n     \"The reformation of his army and the new settlement of his revenues\r\n     are also points of immediate concern, and ought to be immediately\r\n     concluded. Has anything been done in either?\r\n\r\n     \"I now demand and require you most solemnly to answer me. Are you\r\n     confident in your own ability to accomplish all these purposes, and\r\n     the other points of my instructions? If you reply that you are, I\r\n     will depart with a quiet and assured mind to the Presidency, but\r\n     leave you a dreadful responsibility, if you disappoint me. If you\r\n     tell me that you cannot rely upon your power, and the other means\r\n     which you possess for performing these services, I will free you\r\n     from the charge. I will proceed myself to Lucknow, and I will\r\n     myself undertake them; and in that case, I desire that you will\r\n     immediately order bearers to be stationed, for myself and two other\r\n     gentlemen, between Lucknow and Allahabad, and I will set out from\r\n     hence in three days after the receipt of your letter.\r\n\r\n     \"I am sorry that I am under the necessity of writing in this\r\n     pressing manner. I trust implicitly to your integrity, I am certain\r\n     of your attachment to myself, and I know that your capacity is\r\n     equal to any service; but I must express my doubts of your firmness\r\n     and activity, and above all of your recollection of my\r\n     instructions, and of their importance. My conduct in the late\r\n     arrangements will be arraigned with all the rancor of disappointed\r\n     rapacity, and my reputation and influence will suffer a mortal\r\n     wound from the failure of them. They have already failed in a\r\n     degree, since no part of them has yet taken place, but the removal\r\n     of our forces from the Dooab and Rohilcund, and of the British\r\n     officers and pensioners from the service of the Nabob, and the\r\n     expenses of the former thrown without any compensation on the\r\n     Company.\r\n\r\n     \"I expect a supply of money equal to the discharge of all the\r\n     Nabob's arrears, and am much disappointed and mortified that I am\r\n     not now able to return with it.\r\n\r\n     \"Give me an immediate answer to the question which I have herein\r\n     proposed, that I may lose no more time in fruitless inaction.\"\r\n\r\nAbout this time Mr. Hastings had received information of our inquiries\r\nin the House of Commons into his conduct; and this is the manner in\r\nwhich he prepares to meet them. \"I must get money. I must carry with me\r\nthat great excuse for everything, that salve for every sore, that\r\nexpiation for every crime: let me provide that, all is well. You, Mr.\r\nMiddleton, try your nerves: are you equal to these services? Examine\r\nyourself; see what is in you: are you man enough to come up to it?\" says\r\nthe great robber to the little robber, says Roland the Great to his puny\r\naccomplice. \"Are you equal to it? Do you feel yourself a man? If not,\r\nsend messengers and dawks to me, and I, the great master tyrant, will\r\ncome myself, and put to shame all the paltry delegate tools of\r\ndespotism, that have not edge enough to cut their way through and do the\r\nservices I have ordained for them.\"\r\n\r\nI have already stated to your Lordships his reason and motives for this\r\nviolence, and they are such as aggravated his crime by attempting to\r\nimplicate his country in it. He says he was afraid to go home without\r\nhaving provided for the payment of the Nabob's debt. Afraid of what? Was\r\nhe afraid of coming before a British tribunal, and saying, \"Through\r\njustice, through a regard for the rights of an allied sovereign, through\r\na regard to the rights of his people, I have not got so much as I\r\nexpected\"? Of this no man could be afraid. The prisoner's fear had\r\nanother origin. \"I have failed,\" says he to himself, \"in my first\r\nproject. I went to Benares to rob; I have lost by my violence the fruits\r\nof that robbery. I must get the money somewhere, or I dare not appear\r\nbefore a British House of Commons, a British House of Lords, or any\r\nother tribunal in the kingdom; but let me get money enough, and they\r\nwon't care how I get it. The estates of whole bodies of nobility may be\r\nconfiscated; a people who had lived under their protection may be given\r\nup into the hands of foreign usurers: they will care for none of these\r\nthings; they will suffer me to do all this, and to employ in it the\r\nforce of British troops, whom I have described as a set of robbers,\r\nprovided I can get money.\" These were Mr. Hastings's views; and, in\r\naccordance with them, the jaghires were all confiscated, the jaghiredars\r\nwith their families were all turned out, the possessions delivered up to\r\nthe usurer, in order that Mr. Hastings might have the excuse of money to\r\nplead at the bar of the House of Commons, and afterwards at the bar of\r\nthe House of Lords. If your Lordships, in your sacred character of the\r\nfirst tribunal in the world, should by your judgment justify those\r\nproceedings, you will sanction the greatest wrongs that have been ever\r\nknown in history.\r\n\r\nBut to proceed. The next thing to be asked is, Were the promised\r\npensions given to the jaghiredars? I suppose your Lordships are not idle\r\nenough to put that question to us. No compensation, no consideration,\r\nwas given or stipulated for them. If there had been any such thing, the\r\nprisoner could have proved it,--he would have proved it. The means were\r\neasy to him. But we have saved him the trouble of the attempt. We have\r\nproved the contrary, and, if called upon, we will show you the place\r\nwhere this is proved.\r\n\r\nI have now shown your Lordships how Mr. Hastings, having with such\r\nviolent and atrocious circumstances usurped the government of Oude, (I\r\nhope I need not use any farther proof that the Nabob was in effect\r\nnon-existent in the country,) treated all the landed property. The next\r\nquestion will be, How has he treated whatever moneyed property was left\r\nin the country? My Lords, he looked over that immense waste of his own\r\ncreating, not as Satan viewed the kingdoms of the world and saw the\r\npower and glory of them,--but he looked over the waste of Oude with a\r\ndiabolical malice which one could hardly suppose existed in the\r\nprototype himself. He saw nowhere above-ground one single shilling that\r\nhe could attach,--no, not one; every place had been ravaged; no money\r\nremained in sight. But possibly some might be buried in vaults, hid from\r\nthe gripe of tyranny and rapacity. \"It must be so,\" says he. \"Where can\r\nI find it? how can I get at it? There is one illustrious family that is\r\nthought to have accumulated a vast body of treasures, through a course\r\nof three or four successive reigns. It does not appear openly; but we\r\nhave good information that very great sums of money are bricked up and\r\nkept in vaults under ground, and secured under the guard and within the\r\nwalls of a fortress\": the residence of the females of the family, a\r\nguard, as your Lordships know, rendered doubly and trebly secure by the\r\nmanners of the country, which make everything that is in the hands of\r\nwomen sacred. It is said that nothing is proof against gold,--that the\r\nstrongest tower will not be impregnable, if Jupiter makes love in a\r\ngolden shower. This Jupiter commences making love; but he does not come\r\nto the ladies with gold for their persons, he comes to their persons for\r\ntheir gold. This impetuous lover, Mr. Hastings, who is not to be stayed\r\nfrom the objects of his passion, would annihilate space and time between\r\nhim and his beloved object, the jaghires of these ladies, had now,\r\nfirst, their treasure's affection.\r\n\r\nYour Lordships have already had a peep behind the curtain, in the first\r\norders sent to Mr. Middleton. In the treaty of Chunar you see a desire,\r\nobliquely expressed, to get the landed estates of all these great\r\nfamilies. But even while he was meeting with such reluctance in the\r\nNabob upon this point, and though he also met with some resistance upon\r\nthe part even of Mr. Middleton, Mr. Hastings appears to have given him\r\nin charge some other still more obnoxious and dreadful acts. \"While I\r\nwas meditating,\" says Mr. Middleton, in one of his letters, \"upon this\r\n[the resumption of the jaghires], your orders came to me through Sir\r\nElijah Impey.\" What these orders were is left obscure in the letter: it\r\nis yet but as in a mist or cloud. But it is evident that Sir Elijah\r\nImpey did convey to him some project for getting at more wealth by some\r\nother service, which was not to supersede the first, but to be\r\nconcurrent with that upon which Mr. Hastings had before given him such\r\ndreadful charges and had loaded him with such horrible responsibility.\r\nIt could not have been anything but the seizure of the Begum's\r\ntreasures. He thus goaded on two reluctant victims,--first the reluctant\r\nNabob, then the reluctant Mr. Middleton,--forcing them with the bayonet\r\nbehind them, and urging on the former, as at last appears, to violate\r\nthe sanctity of his mother's house.\r\n\r\nYour Lordships have been already told by one of my able fellow Managers,\r\nthat Sir Elijah Impey is the person who carried up the message alluded\r\nto in Mr. Middleton's letter. We have charged it, as an aggravation of\r\nthe offences of the prisoner at your bar, that the Chief-Justice, who,\r\nby the sacred nature of his office, and by the express provisions of the\r\nact of Parliament under which he was sent out to India to redress the\r\nwrongs of the natives, should be made an instrument for destroying the\r\nproperty, real and personal, of this people. When it first came to our\r\nknowledge that all this private intrigue for the destruction of these\r\nhigh women was carried on through the intrigue of a Chief-Justice, we\r\nfelt such shame and such horror, both for the instrument and the\r\nprincipal, as I think it impossible to describe, or for anything but\r\ncomplete and perfect silence to express.\r\n\r\nBut by Sir Elijah Impey was that order carried up to seize and\r\nconfiscate the treasures of the Begums. We know that neither the Company\r\nnor the Nabob had any claim whatever upon these treasures. On the\r\ncontrary, we know that two treaties had been made for the protection of\r\nthem. We know that the Nabob, while he was contesting about some\r\nelephants and carriages, and some other things that he said were in the\r\nhands of their steward, did allow that the treasures in the custody of\r\nhis grandmother and of his mother's principal servants were their\r\nproperty. This is the Nabob who is now represented by Mr. Hastings and\r\nhis counsel to have become the instrument of destroying his mother and\r\ngrandmother, and everything else that ought to be dear to mankind,\r\nthroughout the whole train of his family.\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings, having resolved to seize upon the treasures of the Begums,\r\nis at a loss for some pretence of justifying the act. His first\r\njustification of it is on grounds which all tyrants have ready at their\r\nhands. He begins to discover a legal title to that of which he wished to\r\nbe the possessor, and on this title sets up a claim to these treasures.\r\nI say Mr. Hastings set up this claim, because by this time I suppose\r\nyour Lordships will not bear to hear the Nabob's name on such an\r\noccasion. The prisoner pretended, that, by the Mahometan law, these\r\ngoods did belong to the Nabob; but whether they did or did not, he had\r\nhimself been an active instrument in the treaty for securing their\r\npossession to the Begums,--a security which he attempts to unlock by his\r\nconstructions of the Mahometan law. Having set up this title, the\r\nguaranty still remained; and how is he to get rid of that? In his usual\r\nway. \"You have rebelled, you have taken up arms against your own son,\"\r\n(for that is the pretext,) \"and therefore my guaranty is gone, and your\r\ngoods, whether you have a title to them or not, are to be confiscated\r\nfor your rebellion.\" This is his second expedient by way of\r\njustification.\r\n\r\nYour Lordships will observe the strange situation in which we are here\r\nplaced. If the fact of the rebellion can be proved, the discussion of\r\nthe title to the property in question will be totally useless; for, if\r\nthe ladies had actually taken up arms to cut the Nabob's throat, it\r\nwould require no person to come from the dead to prove to us that the\r\nNabob, but not Mr. Hastings, had a right, for his own security and for\r\nhis own indemnification, to take those treasures, which, whether they\r\nbelonged to him or not, were employed in hostilities against him. The\r\nlaw of self-defence is above every other law; and if any persons draw\r\nthe sword against you, violence on your part is justified, and you may\r\nuse your sword to take from them that property by which they have been\r\nenabled to draw their sword against you.\r\n\r\nBut the prisoner's counsel do not trust to this justification; they set\r\nup a title of right to these treasures: but how entirely they have\r\nfailed in their attempts to substantiate either the one or the other of\r\nthese his alleged justifications your Lordships will now judge. And\r\nfirst with regard to the title. The treasure, they say, belonged to the\r\nstate. The grandmother and mother have robbed the son, and kept him out\r\nof his rightful inheritance. They then produce the Hedaya to show you\r\nwhat proportion of the goods of a Mussulman, when he dies, goes to his\r\nfamily; and here, certainly, there is a question of law to be tried. But\r\nMr. Hastings is a great eccentric genius, and has a course of proceeding\r\nof his own: he first seizes upon the property, and then produces some\r\nMahometan writers to prove that it did not belong to the persons who\r\nwere in possession of it. You would naturally expect, that, when he was\r\ngoing to seize upon those goods, he would have consulted his\r\nChief-Justice, (for, as Sir Elijah Impey went with him, he might have\r\nconsulted him,) and have thus learnt what was the Mahometan law: for,\r\nthough Sir Elijah had not taken his degree at a Mahometan college,\r\nthough he was not a mufti or a moulavy, yet he had always muftis and\r\nmoulavies near him, and he might have consulted them. But Mr. Hastings\r\ndoes not even pretend that such consultations or conferences were ever\r\nhad. If he ever consulted Sir Elijah Impey, where is the report of the\r\ncase? When were the parties before him? Where are the opinions of the\r\nmoulavies? Where is the judgment of the Chief-Justice? Was he fit for\r\nnothing but to be employed as a messenger, as a common tipstaff? Was he\r\nnot fit to try these rights, or to decide upon them? He has told you\r\nhere, indeed, negatively, that he did not know any title Mr. Hastings\r\nhad to seize upon the property of the Begums, except upon his hypothesis\r\nof the rebellion. He was asked if he knew any other. He answered, No. It\r\nconsequently appears that Mr. Hastings, though he had before him his\r\ndoctors of all laws, who could unravel for him all the enigmas of all\r\nthe laws in the world, and who had himself shone upon questions of\r\nMahometan law, in the case of the Nuddea Begum, did not dare to put this\r\ncase to Sir Elijah Impey, and ask what was his opinion concerning the\r\nrights of these people. He was tender, I suppose, of the reputation of\r\nthe Chief-Justice. For Sir Elijah Impey, though a very good man to write\r\na letter, or take an affidavit in a corner, or run on a message, to do\r\nthe business of an under-sheriff, tipstaff, or bum-bailiff, was not fit\r\nto give an opinion on a question of Mahometan law.\r\n\r\nYou have heard Ali Ibrahim Khân referred to. This Mahometan lawyer was\r\ncarried by Mr. Hastings up to Benares, to be a witness of the vast good\r\nhe had done in that province, and was made Chief-Justice there. All,\r\nindeed, that we know of him, except the high character given of him by\r\nMr. Hastings, is, I believe, that he is the Ali Ibrahim Khân whom in the\r\nCompany's records I find mentioned as a person giving bribes upon some\r\nformer occasion to Mr. Hastings; but whatever he was besides, he was a\r\ndoctor of the Mahometan law, he was a mufti, and was made by Mr.\r\nHastings the principal judge in a criminal court, exercising, as I\r\nbelieve, likewise a considerable civil jurisdiction, and therefore he\r\nwas qualified as a lawyer; and Mr. Hastings cannot object to his\r\nqualifications either of integrity or of knowledge. This man was with\r\nhim. Why did not he consult him upon this law? Why did he not make him\r\nout a case of John Doe and Richard Roe, of John Stokes and John à Nokes?\r\nWhy not say, \"Sinub possesses such things, under such and such\r\ncircumstances: give me your opinion upon the legality of the\r\npossession\"? No, he did no such thing.\r\n\r\nYour Lordships, I am sure, will think it a little extraordinary, that\r\nneither this chief-justice made by himself, nor that other chief-justice\r\nwhom he led about with him in a string,--the one an English\r\nchief-justice, with a Mahometan suit in his court, the other a Mahometan\r\nchief-justice of the country,--that neither of them was consulted as\r\nlawyers by the prisoner. Both of them were, indeed, otherwise employed\r\nby him. For we find Ali Ibrahim Khân employed in the same subservient\r\ncapacity in which Sir Elijah Impey was,--in order, I suppose, to keep\r\nthe law of England and the law of Mahomet upon a just par: for upon this\r\nequality Mr. Hastings always values himself. Neither of these two\r\nchief-justices, I say, was ever consulted, nor one opinion taken; but\r\nthey were both employed in the correspondence and private execution of\r\nthis abominable project, when the prisoner himself had not either\r\nleisure or perhaps courage to give his public order in it till things\r\ngot to greater ripeness.\r\n\r\nTo Sir Elijah Impey, indeed, he did put a question; and, upon my word,\r\nit did not require an Oedipus or a Sphinx to answer it. Says he, \"I\r\nasked Sir Elijah Impey.\" What? a question on the title between the Nabob\r\nand his mother? No such thing. He puts an hypothetical question.\r\n\"Supposing,\" says he, \"a rebellion to exist in that country; will the\r\nNabob be justified in seizing the goods of the rebels?\" That is a\r\nquestion decided in a moment; and I must have a malice to Sir Elijah\r\nImpey of which I am incapable, to deny the propriety of his answer. But\r\nobserve, I pray you, my Lords, there is something peculiarly good and\r\ncorrect in it. He does not take upon him to say one word of the actual\r\nexistence of a rebellion, though he was at the time in the country, and,\r\nif there had been any, he must have been a witness to it; but, so chaste\r\nwas his character as a judge, that he would not touch upon the juries'\r\noffice. \"I am chief-justice here,\" says he, \"though a little wandering\r\nout of my orbit; yet still the sacred office of justice is in me. Do you\r\ntake upon you the fact; I find the law.\" Were it not for this sacred\r\nattention to separate jurisdictions, he might have been a tolerable\r\njudge of the fact,--just as good a judge as Mr. Hastings: for neither of\r\nthem knew it any other way, as it appears afterwards, but by rumor and\r\nreports,--reports, I believe, of Mr. Hastings's own raising; for I do\r\nnot know that Sir Elijah Impey had anything to do with them.\r\n\r\nBut to proceed. With regard to the title of these ladies, according to\r\nthe Mahometan law, you have nothing laid before you by the prisoner's\r\ncounsel but a quotation cut out with the scissors from a Mahometan\r\nlaw-book, (which I suspect very much the learned gentlemen have never\r\nread through,) declaring how a Mahometan's effects are to be\r\ndistributed. But Mr. Hastings could not at the time have consulted that\r\nlearned counsel who now defends him upon the principles of the Hedaya,\r\nthe Hedaya not having been then published in English; and I will venture\r\nto say, that neither Sir Elijah Impey nor Ali Ibrahim Khân, nor any\r\nother person, high or low, in India, ever suggested this defence, and\r\nthat it was never thought of till lately found by the learned counsel in\r\nthe English translation of the Hedaya. \"God bless me!\" now says Mr.\r\nHastings, \"what ignorance have I been in all this time! I thought I was\r\nseizing this unjustly, and that the pretence of rebellion was necessary;\r\nbut my counsel have found out a book, since published, and from it they\r\nproduce the law upon that subject, and show that the Nabob had a right\r\nto seize upon the treasures of his mother.\" But are your Lordships so\r\nignorant--(your Lordships are not ignorant of anything)--are any men so\r\nignorant as not to know that in every country the common law of\r\ndistribution of the estate of an intestate amongst private individuals\r\nis no rule with regard to the family arrangements of great princes? Is\r\nany one ignorant, that, from the days of the first origin of the Persian\r\nmonarchy, the laws of which have become rules ever since for almost all\r\nthe monarchs of the East, the wives of great men have had, independent\r\nof the common distribution of their goods, great sums of money and great\r\nestates in land, one for their girdle, one for their veil, and so on,\r\ngoing through the rest of their ornaments and attire,--and that they\r\nheld great estates and other effects over which the reigning monarch or\r\nhis successor had no control whatever? Indeed, my Lords, a more curious\r\nand extraordinary species of trial than this of a question of right\r\nnever was heard of since the world began. Mr. Hastings begins with\r\nseizing the goods of the Begums at Fyzabad, nine thousand miles from\r\nyou, and fourteen years after tries the title in an English court,\r\nwithout having one person to appear for these miserable ladies. I trust\r\nyou will not suffer this mockery; I hope this last and ultimate shame\r\nwill be spared us: for I declare to God, that the defence, and the\r\nprinciples of it, appear to me ten thousand times worse than the act\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nNow, my Lords, this criminal, through his counsel, chooses, with their\r\nusual flippancy, to say that the Commons have been _cautious_ in stating\r\nthis part of the charge, knowing that they were on tender ground, and\r\ntherefore did not venture to say _entitled_, but _possessed of_ only. A\r\nnotable discovery indeed! We are as far from being taken in by such\r\nmiserable distinctions as we are incapable of making them. We certainly\r\nhave not said that the Begums were entitled to, but only that they were\r\npossessed of, certain property. And we have so said because we were not\r\ncompetent to decide upon their title, because your Lordships are not\r\ncompetent to decide upon their title, because no part of this tribunal\r\nis competent to decide upon their title. You have not the parties before\r\nyou; you have not the cause before you,--but are getting it by oblique,\r\nimproper, and indecent means. You are not a court of justice to try that\r\nquestion. The parties are at a distance from you; they are neither\r\npresent themselves, nor represented by any counsel, advocate, or\r\nattorney: and I hope no House of Lords will ever judge and decide upon\r\nthe title of any human being, much less upon the title of the first\r\nwomen in Asia, sequestered, shut up from you, at nine thousand miles'\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nI believe, my Lords, that the Emperor of Hindostan little thought, while\r\nDelhi stood, that an English subject of Mr. Hastings's description\r\nshould domineer over the Vizier of his empire, and give the law to the\r\nfirst persons in his dominions. He as little dreamed of it as any of\r\nyour Lordships now dream that you shall have your property seized by a\r\ndelegate from Lucknow, and have it tried by what tenure a peer or\r\npeeress of Great Britain hold, the one his estate, and the other her\r\njointure, dower, or her share of goods, her paraphernalia, in any court\r\nof Adawlut in Hindostan. If any such thing should happen, (for we know\r\nnot what may happen; we live in an age of strange revolutions, and I\r\ndoubt whether any more strange than this,) the Commons of Great Britain\r\nwould shed their best blood sooner than suffer that a tribunal at\r\nLucknow should decide upon any of your titles, for the purpose of\r\njustifying a robber that has taken your property. We should do the best\r\nwe could, if such a strange circumstance occurred.\r\n\r\nThe House of Commons, who are virtually the representatives of Lucknow,\r\nand who lately took 500,000_l._ of their money, will not suffer the\r\nnatives first to be robbed of their property, and then the titles, which\r\nby the laws of their own country they have to the goods they possess, to\r\nbe tried by any tribunal in Great Britain. Why was it not tried in India\r\nbefore Mr. Hastings? One would suppose that an English governor, if\r\ncalled to decide upon such a claim of the Nabob's, would doubtless be\r\nattended by judges, muftis, lawyers, and all the apparatus of legal\r\njustice. No such thing. This man marches into the country, not with\r\nmoulavies, not with muftis, not with the solemn apparatus of Oriental\r\njustice,--no: he goes with colonels, and captains, and majors,--these\r\nare his lawyers: and when he gets there, he demands from the parties,\r\nnot their title,--no: \"Give me your money!\" is his cry. It is a shame\r\n(and I will venture to say, that these gentlemen, upon recollection,\r\nwill feel ashamed) to see the bar justify what the sword is ashamed of.\r\nIn reading this correspondence, I have found these great muftis and\r\nlawyers, these great chief-justices, attorneys-general, and\r\nsolicitors-general, called colonels and captains, ashamed of these\r\nproceedings, and endeavoring to mitigate their cruelty; yet we see\r\nBritish lawyers in a British tribunal supporting and justifying these\r\nacts, on the plea of defective titles.\r\n\r\nThe learned counsel asks, with an air of triumph, whether these ladies\r\npossessed these treasures by jointure, dower, will, or settlement. What\r\nwas the title? Was it a deed of gift?--was it a devise?--was it _donatio\r\ncausâ mortis?_--was it dower?--was it jointure?--what was it? To all\r\nwhich senseless and absurd questions we answer, You asked none of these\r\nquestions of the parties, when you guarantied to them, by a solemn\r\ntreaty, the possession of their goods. Then was the time to have asked\r\nthese questions: but you asked none of them. You supposed their right,\r\nand you guarantied it, though you might then have asked what was their\r\nright. But besides the force and virtue of the guaranty, these unhappy\r\nprincesses had ransomed themselves from any claim upon their property.\r\nThey paid a sum of money, applied to your use, for that guaranty. They\r\nhad a treble title,--by possession, by guaranty, by purchase.\r\n\r\nAgain, did you ask these questions, when you went to rob them of their\r\nlanded estates, their money, their ornaments, and even their\r\nwearing-apparel? When you sent those great lawyers, Major ----, Major\r\n----, and the other majors, and colonels, and captains, did you call on\r\nthem to exhibit their title-deeds? No: with a pistol at their breast,\r\nyou demanded their money. Instead of forging a charge of rebellion\r\nagainst these unhappy persons, why did you not then call on them for\r\ntheir vouchers? No rebellion was necessary to give validity to a civil\r\nclaim. What you could get by an ordinary judgment did not want\r\nconfiscation called to its aid. When you had their eunuchs, their\r\nministers, their treasurers, their agents and attorneys in irons, did\r\nyou then ask any of these questions? No. \"Discover the money you have in\r\ntrust, or _you_ go to corporal punishment,--_you_ go to the castle of\r\nChunar,--here is another pair of irons!\"--this was the only language\r\nused.\r\n\r\nWhen the Court of Directors, alarmed at the proceedings against these\r\nancient ladies, ordered their Indian government to make an inquiry into\r\ntheir conduct, the prisoner had then an opportunity and a duty imposed\r\nupon him of entering into a complete justification of his conduct: he\r\nmight have justified it by every civil, and by every criminal mode of\r\nprocess. Did he do this? No. Your Lordships have in evidence the manner,\r\nequally despotic, _rebellious_, insolent, fraudulent, tricking, and\r\nevasive, by which he positively refused all inquiry into the matter. How\r\nstands it now, more than twelve years after the seizure of their goods,\r\nat ten thousand miles' distance? You ask of these women, buried in the\r\ndepths of Asia, secluded from human commerce, what is their title to\r\ntheir estate. Have you the parties before you? Have you summoned them?\r\nWhere is their attorney? Where is their agent? Where is their counsel?\r\nIs this law? Is this a legal process? Is this a tribunal,--the highest\r\ntribunal of all,--that which is to furnish the example for, and to be a\r\ncontrol on all the rest? But what is worse, you do not come _directly_\r\nto the trial of this right to property. You are desired to surround and\r\ncircumvent it; you are desired obliquely to steal an iniquitous\r\njudgment, which you dare not boldly ravish. At this judgment you can\r\nonly arrive by a side wind. You have before you a criminal process\r\nagainst an offender. One of the charges against him is, that he has\r\nrobbed matrons of high and reverend place. His defence is, that they had\r\nnot the apt deeds to entitle them in law to this property. _In_ this\r\ncause, with only the delinquent party before you, you are called upon to\r\ntry their title on his allegations of its invalidity, and by acquitting\r\nhim to divest them not only of their goods, but of their honor,--to call\r\nthem disseizors, wrong-doers, cheats, defrauders of their own son. No\r\nhearing for them,--no pleading,--all appeal cut off. Was ever a man\r\nindicted for a robbery, that is, for the forcible taking of the goods\r\npossessed by another, suffered to desire the prosecutor to show the\r\ndeeds or other instruments by which he acquired those goods? The idea is\r\ncontemptible and ridiculous. Do these men dream? Do they conceive, in\r\ntheir confused imaginations, that you can be here trying such a\r\nquestion, and venturing to decide upon it? Your Lordships will never do\r\nthat, which if you did do, you would be unfit to subsist as a tribunal\r\nfor a single hour; and if we, on our part, did not bring before you this\r\nattempt, as the heaviest aggravation of the prisoner's crimes, we\r\nshould betray our trust as representatives of the Commons of Great\r\nBritain. Having made this protest in favor of law, of justice, and good\r\npolicy, permit me to take a single step more.\r\n\r\nI will now show your Lordships that it is very possible, nay, very\r\nprobable, and almost certain, that a great part of what these ladies\r\npossessed was a saving of their own, and independent of any grant. It\r\nappears in the papers before you, that these unfortunate ladies had\r\nabout 70,000_l._ a year, landed property. Mr. Bristow states in evidence\r\nbefore your Lordships, that their annual expenses did not exceed a lac\r\nand a half, and that their income was about seven lacs; that they had\r\npossessed this for twenty years before the death of Sujah Dowlah, and\r\nfrom the death of that prince to the day of the robbery. Now, if your\r\nLordships will calculate what the savings from an income of 70,000_l._ a\r\nyear will amount to, when the party spends about 15,000_l._ a year, you\r\nwill see that by a regular and strict economy these people may have\r\nsaved considerable property of their own, independent of their titles to\r\nany other property: and this is a rational way of accounting for their\r\nbeing extremely rich. It may be supposed, likewise, that they had all\r\nthose advantages which ladies of high rank usually have in that\r\ncountry,--gifts at marriage, &c. We know that there are deeds of gift by\r\nhusbands to their wives during their lifetime, and many other legal\r\nmeans, by which women in Asia become possessed of very great property.\r\nBut Mr. Hastings has taught them the danger of much wealth, and the\r\ndanger of economy. He has shown them that they are saving, not for their\r\nfamilies, for those who may possibly stand in the utmost need of it,\r\nbut for tyrants, robbers, and oppressors.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, I am really ashamed to have said so much upon the subject of\r\ntheir titles. And yet there is one observation more to be made, and then\r\nI shall have done with this part of the prisoner's defence. It is, that\r\nthe Nabob himself never has made a claim on this ground; even Mr.\r\nHastings, his despotic master, could never get him regularly and\r\nsystematically to make such a claim; the very reverse of this is the\r\ntruth. When urged on to the commission of these acts of violence by Mr.\r\nMiddleton, you have seen with what horror and how reluctantly he lends\r\nhis name; and when he does so, he is dragged like a victim to the stake.\r\nAt the beginning of this affair, where do we find that he entered this\r\nclaim, as the foundation of it? Upon one occasion only, when dragged to\r\njoin in this wicked act, something dropped from his lips which seemed\r\nrather to have been forced into his mouth, and which he was obliged to\r\nspit out again, about the possibility that he might have had some right\r\nto the effects of the Begums.\r\n\r\nWe next come to consider the manner in which these acts of violence were\r\nexecuted. They forced the Nabob himself to accompany their troops, and\r\ntheir Resident, Mr. Middleton, to attack the city and to storm the fort\r\nin which these ladies lived, and consequently to outrage their persons,\r\nto insult their character, and to degrade their dignity, as well as to\r\nrob them of all they had.\r\n\r\nThat your Lordships may learn something of one of these ladies, called\r\nthe Munny Begum, I will refer you to Major Browne's evidence,--a man who\r\nwas at Delhi, the fountain-head of all the nobility of India, and must\r\nhave known who this lady was that has been treated with such indignity\r\nby the prisoner at your bar. Major Browne was asked, \"What was the\r\nopinion at Delhi respecting the rank, quality, and character of the\r\nPrincesses of Oude, or of either of them?\"--\"The elder, or Munny Begum,\r\nwas,\" says he, \"a woman of high rank: she was, I believe, the daughter\r\nof Saadut Ali Khân, a person of high rank in the time of Mahommed\r\nShah.\"--\"Do you know whether any woman in all Hindostan was considered\r\nof superior rank or birth?\"--He answers, \"I believe not, except those of\r\nthe royal family. She was a near relation to Mirza Shaffee Khân, who was\r\na noble of nobles, the first person at that day in the empire.\" In\r\nanswer to another question put by a noble Lord, in the same examination,\r\nrespecting the conversation which he had with Mirza Shaffee Khân, and of\r\nwhich he had given an account, he says, \"He [Mirza Shaffee Khân] spoke\r\nof the attempt to seize the treasures of the Begums, which was then\r\nsuspected, in terms of resentment, and as a disgrace in which he\r\nparticipated, as being related by blood to the house of Sufdar Jung, who\r\nwas the husband of the old Begum.\" He says afterwards, in the same\r\nexamination, that he, the Begum's husband, was the second man, and that\r\nher father was the first man, in the Mogul empire. Now the Mogul empire,\r\nwhen this woman came into the world, was an empire of that dignity that\r\nkings were its subjects; and this very Mirza Shaffee Khân, that we speak\r\nof, her near relation, was then a prince with a million a year revenue,\r\nand a man of the first rank, after the Great Mogul, in the whole empire.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, these were people that ought to have been treated with a\r\nlittle decorum. When we consider the high rank of their husbands, their\r\nfathers, and their children, a rank so high that we have nothing in\r\nGreat Britain to compare with theirs, we cannot be surprised that they\r\nwere left in possession of great revenues, great landed estates, and\r\ngreat moneyed property. All the female parts of these families, whose\r\nalliance was, doubtless, much courted, could not be proffered in\r\nmarriage, and endowed in a manner agreeably to the dignity of such\r\npersons, but with great sums of money; and your Lordships must also\r\nconsider the multitude of children of which these families frequently\r\nconsisted. The consequences of this robbery were such as might naturally\r\nbe expected. It is said that not one of the females of this family has\r\nsince been given in marriage.\r\n\r\nBut all this has nothing to do with the rebellion. If they had, indeed,\r\nrebelled to cut their own son's throat, there is an end of the business.\r\nBut what evidence have you of this fact? and if none can be produced,\r\ndoes not the prisoner's defence aggravate infinitely his crime and that\r\nof his agents? Did they ever once state to these unfortunate women that\r\nany such rebellion existed? Did they ever charge them with it? Did they\r\never set the charge down in writing, or make it verbally, that they had\r\nconspired to destroy their son, a son whom Mr. Hastings had brought\r\nthere to rob them? No, this was what neither Mr. Hastings nor his agent\r\never did: for as they never made a civil demand upon them, so they never\r\nmade a criminal charge against them, or against any person belonging to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nI save your Lordships the trouble of listening to the manner in which\r\nthey seized upon these people, and dispersed their guard. Mr. Middleton\r\nstates, that they found great difficulties in getting at their\r\ntreasures,--that they stormed their forts successively, but found great\r\nreluctance in the sepoys to make their way into the inner inclosures of\r\nthe women's apartments. Being at a loss what to do, their only resource,\r\nhe says, was to threaten that they would seize their eunuchs. These are\r\ngenerally persons who have been bought slaves, and who, not having any\r\nconnections in the country where they are settled, are supposed to guard\r\nboth the honor of the women, and their treasures, with more fidelity\r\nthan other persons would do. We know that in Constantinople, and in many\r\nother places, these persons enjoy offices of the highest trust, and are\r\nof great rank and dignity; and this dignity and rank they possess for\r\nthe purpose of enabling them to fulfil their great trusts more\r\neffectually. The two principal eunuchs of the Begums were Jewar and\r\nBehar Ali Khân, persons of as high rank and estimation as any people in\r\nthe country. These persons, however, were seized, not, says Mr.\r\nHastings, for the purpose of extorting money, as assumed in the charge,\r\nbut as agents and principal instruments of exciting the insurrection\r\nbefore alluded to, &c. Mr. Hastings declares that they were not seized\r\nfor the purpose of extorting money, but that they were seized in order\r\nto be punished for their crimes, and, _eo nomine_, for this crime of\r\nrebellion. Now this crime could not have been committed immediately by\r\n[the?] women themselves; for no woman can come forward and head her own\r\ntroops. We have not heard that any woman has done so since the time of\r\nZenobia, in another part of the East; and we know that in Persia no\r\nperson can behold the face of a woman of rank, or speak to females of\r\ncondition, but through a curtain: therefore they could not go out\r\nthemselves, and be active in a rebellion. But, I own, it would be some\r\nsort of presumption against them, if Jewar Ali Khân and Behar Ali Khân\r\nhad headed troops, and been concerned in acts of rebellion; and the\r\nprisoner's counsel have taken abundance of pains to show that such\r\npersons do sometimes head armies and command legions in the East. This\r\nwe acknowledge that they sometimes do. If these eunuchs had behaved in\r\nthis way, if they had headed armies and commanded legions for the\r\npurposes of rebellion, it would have been a fair presumption that their\r\nmistresses were concerned in it. But instead of any proof of such facts,\r\nMr. Hastings simply says, \"We do not arrest them for the purpose of\r\nextorting money, but as a punishment for their crimes.\" By Mr.\r\nMiddleton's account you will see the utter falsity of this assertion.\r\nGod knows what he has said that is true. It would, indeed, be singular\r\nnot to detect him in a falsity, but in a truth. I will now show your\r\nLordships the utter falsity of this wicked allegation.\r\n\r\nThere is a letter from Mr. Middleton to Sir Elijah Impey, dated Fyzabad,\r\nthe 25th of January, 1782, to which I will call your Lordships'\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n     \"Dear Sir Elijah,--I have the satisfaction to inform you that we\r\n     have at length so far obtained the great object of our expedition\r\n     to this place as to commence on the receipt of money, of which, in\r\n     the course of this day, we have got about six lacs. I know not yet\r\n     what amount we shall actually realize, but I think I may safely\r\n     venture to pronounce it will be equal to the liquidation of the\r\n     Company's balance. It has been at once the most important and the\r\n     most difficult point of duty which has ever occurred in my office;\r\n     and the anxiety, the hopes and fears, which have alternately\r\n     agitated my mind, cannot be described or conceived but by those who\r\n     have been witness to what has passed in the course of this long\r\n     contest. The [Nabob's] ministers have supported me nobly, and\r\n     deserve much commendation. Without the shrewd discernment and\r\n     knowledge of the finesse and tricks of the country which Hyder Beg\r\n     Khân possesses, I believe we should have succeeded but\r\n     indifferently; for I soon found that no real advantage was to be\r\n     obtained by proceeding at once to violent extremities with the\r\n     Begum, and that she was only to be attacked through the medium of\r\n     her confidential servants, who it required considerable address to\r\n     get hold of. However, we at last effected it; and by using some few\r\n     severities with them, we at length came at the secret hoards of\r\n     this old lady. I will write you more particulars hereafter.\r\n\r\n     \"I am sorry to inform you my little boy still continues in a very\r\n     precarious way, though somewhat better than when I had last the\r\n     honor to address you. My respects to Lady Impey. And believe me,\r\n     with great regard, my dear Sir Elijah, your faithful, obliged, and\r\n     most affectionate humble servant,\r\n\r\n       \"NATHANIEL MIDDLETON.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, we produce this letter to your Lordships, because it is a\r\nletter which begins with \"_Dear Sir Elijah_,\" and alludes to some family\r\nmatters, and is therefore more likely to discover the real truth, the\r\ntrue genius of a proceeding, than all the formal and official stuff that\r\never was produced. You see the tenderness and affection in which they\r\nproceed. You see it is his _dear Sir Elijah_. You see that he does not\r\ntell the dear Sir Elijah, the Chief-Justice of India, the pillar of the\r\nlaw, the great conservator of personal liberty and private property,--he\r\ndoes not tell him that he has been able to convict these eunuchs of any\r\ncrime; he does not tell him he has the pleasure of informing him what\r\nmatter he has got upon which a decision at law may be grounded; he does\r\nnot tell him that he has got the least proof of the want of title in\r\nthose ladies: not a word of the kind. You cannot help observing the soft\r\nlanguage used in this tender billet-doux between Mr. Middleton and Sir\r\nElijah Impey. You would imagine that they were making love, and that you\r\nheard the voice of the turtle in the land. You hear the soft cooing, the\r\ngentle addresses,--\"Oh, my hopes!\" to-day, \"My fears!\" to-morrow,--all\r\nthe language of friendship, almost heightened into love; and it comes at\r\nlast to \"_I have got at the secret hoards of these ladies_.--Let us\r\nrejoice, my dear Sir Elijah; this is a day of rejoicing, a day of\r\ntriumph; and this triumph we have obtained by seizing upon the old\r\nlady's eunuchs,--in doing which, however, we found a great deal of\r\ndifficulty.\" You would imagine, from this last expression, that it was\r\nnot two eunuchs, with a few miserable women clinging about them, that\r\nthey had to seize, but that they had to break through all the guards\r\nwhich we see lovers sometimes breaking through, when they want to get at\r\ntheir ladies. Hardly ever did the beauty of a young lady excite such\r\nrapture; I defy all the charms this country can furnish to produce a\r\nmore wonderful effect than was produced by the hoards of these two old\r\nwomen, in the bosoms of Sir Elijah Impey and Mr. Middleton. \"We have\r\ngot,\" he exultingly says, \"we have got to the secret hoards of this old\r\nlady!\" And I verily believe there never was a passion less dissembled;\r\nthere Nature spoke; there was truth triumphant, honest truth. Others may\r\nfeign a passion; but nobody can doubt the raptures of Mr. Hastings, Sir\r\nElijah Impey, and Mr. Middleton.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, one would have expected to have found here something of their\r\ncrimes, something of their rebellion, for he talks of a few \"necessary\r\nseverities.\" But no: you find the real criminal, the real object, was\r\nthe secret hoards of the old ladies. It is true, _a few severities_ were\r\nnecessary to obtain that object: however, they did obtain it. How then\r\ndid they proceed? First, they themselves took and received, in weight\r\nand tale, all the money that was in the place. I say _all_; for whether\r\nthere was any more they never have discovered, with all their search,\r\nfrom that day to this. Therefore we fairly presume that they had\r\ndiscovered all that there was to discover with regard to money. They\r\nnext took from these unfortunate people an engagement for the amount of\r\ntreasure at a definite sum, without knowing whether they had it or not,\r\nwhether they could procure it or not. The Bhow Begum has told us, as\r\nyour Lordships have it in evidence, that they demanded from her a\r\nmillion of money; that she, of course, denied having any such sums; but\r\nMr. Middleton forced her unfortunate eunuchs or treasurers, by some _few\r\nseverities_, to give their bond for 600,000_l._\r\n\r\nYou would imagine, that, when these eunuchs had given up all that was in\r\ntheir power, when they had given a bond for what they had not, (for they\r\nwere only the treasurers of other people,) that the bond would not have\r\nbeen rigidly exacted. But what do Mr. Hastings and Mr. Middleton, as\r\nsoon as they get their plunder? They went to their own assay-table, by\r\nwhich they measured the rate of exchange between the coins in currency\r\nat Oude and those at Calcutta, and add the difference to the sum for\r\nwhich the bond was given. Thus they seize the secret hoards, they\r\nexamine it as if they were receiving a debt, and they determine what\r\nthis money would and ought to produce at Calcutta: not considering it as\r\ncoming from people who gave all they had to give, but as what it would\r\nproduce at the mint at Calcutta, according to a custom made for the\r\nprofit of the Residents; even though Mr. Hastings, upon another\r\noccasion, charged upon Mr. Bristow as a crime that he had made that\r\nprofit. This money, my Lords, was taken to that assay-table, which they\r\nhad invented for their own profit, and they made their victims pay a\r\nrupee and a half batta, or exchange of money, upon each gold mohur; by\r\nwhich and other charges they brought them 60,000_l._ more in debt, and\r\nforced them to give a bond for that 60,000_l._\r\n\r\nYour Lordships have seen in what manner these debts were\r\ncontracted,--and that they were contracted by persons engaging, not for\r\nthemselves, for they had nothing; all their property was apparently\r\ntheir mistresses'. You will now see in what manner the payment of them\r\nwas exacted; and we shall beg leave to read to you their own accounts of\r\ntheir own proceedings. Your Lordships will then judge whether they were\r\nproceeding against rebels as rebels, or against wealthy people as\r\nwealthy people, punishing them, under pretence of crimes, for their own\r\nprofit.\r\n\r\nIn a letter from Mr. Middleton to Mr. Hastings, after two other\r\nparagraphs, he goes on thus.\r\n\r\n\"It remained only to get possession of her wealth; and to effect this,\r\nit was then and is still my firm and unalterable opinion that it was\r\nindispensably necessary to employ temporizing expedients, and to work\r\nupon the hopes and fears of the Begum herself, and more especially upon\r\nthose of her principal agents, through whose means alone there appeared\r\nany probable chance of our getting access to the hidden treasures of the\r\nlate Vizier; and when I acquaint you that by far the greatest part of\r\nthe treasure which has been delivered to the Nabob was taken from the\r\nmost secret recesses in the houses of the two eunuchs, whence, of\r\ncourse, it could not have been extracted without the adoption of those\r\nmeans which could induce the discovery, I shall hope for your\r\napprobation of what I did. I must also observe, that no further rigor\r\nthan that which I exerted could have been used against females in this\r\ncountry, to whom there can be no access. The Nabob and Salar Jung were\r\nthe only two that could enter the zenanah: the first was a son, who was\r\nto address a parent, and, of course, could use no language or action but\r\nthat of earnest and reiterated solicitation; and the other was, in all\r\nappearance, a traitor to our cause. Where force could be employed, it\r\nwas not spared: the troops of the Begum were driven away and dispersed;\r\ntheir guns taken; her fort, and the outward walls of her house seized\r\nand occupied by our troops, at the Nabob's requisition; and her chief\r\nagents imprisoned and put in irons. No further step was left. And in\r\nthis situation they still remain, and are to continue (excepting only a\r\nremission of the irons) until the final liquidation of the payment; and\r\nif then you deem it proper, no possible means of offence being left in\r\nher hands or those of her agents, all her lands and property having been\r\ntaken, I mean, with your sanction, to restore her house and servants to\r\nher, and hope to be favored with your early reply, as I expect that a\r\nfew days will complete the final surrender of all that is further\r\nexpected from the Begum.\"\r\n\r\nThere are some things in this letter which I shall beg your Lordships to\r\nremark. There is mention made of a few preliminary severities used by\r\nMr. Middleton, in order to get at their money. Well, he did get at the\r\nmoney, and he got a bond for the payment of an additional sum, which\r\nthey thought proper to fix at about six hundred thousand pounds, to\r\nwhich was added another usurious bond for sixty thousand; and in order\r\nto extort these forced bonds, and to make up their aggravated crimes of\r\nusury, violence, and oppression, they put these eunuchs into prison,\r\nwithout food and water, and loaded their limbs with fetters. This was\r\ntheir second imprisonment; and what followed these few severities your\r\nLordships will remark,--still more severities. They continued to\r\npersecute, to oppress, to work upon these men by torture and by the fear\r\nof torture, till at last, having found that all their proceedings were\r\ntotally ineffectual, they desire the women to surrender their house;\r\nthough it is in evidence before you, that to remove a woman from her own\r\nhouse to another house without her consent is an outrage of the greatest\r\natrocity, on account of which many women have not only threatened, but\r\nhave actually put themselves to death. Mr. Hastings himself, in the case\r\nof Munny Begum, had considered such a proposition as the last degree of\r\noutrage that could be offered. These women offered to go from house to\r\nhouse while their residence was searched; but \"No,\" say their\r\ntormentors, \"the treasure may be bricked up, in so large a house, in\r\nsuch a manner that we cannot find it.\"\r\n\r\nBut to proceed with the treatment of these unfortunate men. I will read\r\nto your Lordships a letter of Mr. Middleton to Captain Leonard Jaques,\r\ncommanding at Fyzabad, 18th March, 1782.\r\n\r\n     \"Sir,--I have received your letter of the 13th instant. The two\r\n     prisoners, Behar and Jewar Ali Khân, having violated their written\r\n     solemn engagement with me for the payment of the balance due to the\r\n     Honorable Company on the Nabob's assignments accepted by them, and\r\n     declining giving me any satisfactory assurances on that head, I am\r\n     under the disagreeable necessity of recurring to severities to\r\n     enforce the said payment. This is, therefore, to desire that you\r\n     immediately cause them to be put in irons, and kept so until I\r\n     shall arrive at Fyzabad, to take further measures, as may be\r\n     necessary.\"\r\n\r\nHere is the answer of Captain Jaques to Mr. Middleton.\r\n\r\n        \"_April 23d, 1782._\r\n\r\n     \"Sir,--Allow me the honor of informing you that the place the\r\n     prisoners Behar Ali Khân and Jewar Ali Khân are confined in is\r\n     become so very unhealthy, by the number obliged to be on duty in so\r\n     confined a place at this hot season of the year, and so situated,\r\n     that no reduction can with propriety be made from their guard, it\r\n     being at such a distance from the battalion.\"\r\n\r\nYou see, my Lords, what a condition these unfortunate persons were in at\r\nthat period; you see they were put in irons, in a place highly\r\nunhealthy; and from this you will judge of the treatment which followed\r\nthe _few severities_. The first yielded a bond for 600,000_l._; the\r\nsecond, a bond for 60,000_l._; the third was intended to extort the\r\npayment of these bonds, and completed their series.\r\n\r\nI will now read a letter from Captain Jaques to Mr. Middleton, from the\r\nprinted Minutes, dated _Palace, Fyzabad, May 18th, 1782_, consequently\r\nwritten nearly a month after the former.\r\n\r\n     \"Sir,--The prisoners Behar and Jewar Ali Khân, who seem to be very\r\n     sickly, have requested their irons might be taken off for a few\r\n     days, that they might take medicine, and walk about the garden of\r\n     the place where they are confined, to assist the medicine in its\r\n     operation. Now, as I am sure they would be equally as secure\r\n     without their irons as with them, I think it my duty to inform you\r\n     of this request, and desire to know your pleasure concerning it.\r\n\r\n       (Signed) \"LEONARD JAQUES.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 22d May, 1782, Captain Jaques's humane proposal is thus replied\r\nto by Mr. Middleton.\r\n\r\n     \"I am sorry it is not in my power to comply with your proposal of\r\n     easing the prisoners for a few days of their fetters. Much as my\r\n     humanity may be touched by their sufferings, I should think it\r\n     inexpedient to afford them any alleviation while they persist in a\r\n     breach of their contract with me; and, indeed, no indulgence could\r\n     be shown them without the authority of the Nabob, who, instead of\r\n     consenting to moderate the rigors of their situation, would be most\r\n     willing to multiply them.\r\n\r\n       (Signed) \"NATHANIEL MIDDLETON.\"\r\n\r\nI will now call your Lordships' attention to other letters connected\r\nwith this transaction.\r\n\r\n     _Letter from Major Gilpin to Mr. Middleton, June 5th, 1782._\r\n\r\n     \"Sir,--Agreeably to your instructions, I went to the prisoners,\r\n     Behar and Jewar Ali Khân, accompanied by Hoolas Roy, who read the\r\n     papers respecting the balance now due, &c., &c.\r\n\r\n     \"In general terms they expressed concern at not being able to\r\n     discharge the same without the assistance of the Begum, and\r\n     requested indulgence to send a message to her on that subject, and\r\n     in the evening they would give an answer.\r\n\r\n     \"I went at the time appointed for the answer, but did not receive a\r\n     satisfactory one; in consequence of which I desired them to be\r\n     ready, at the shortest notice, to proceed to Lucknow, and explained\r\n     to them every particular contained in your letter of the 1st\r\n     instant respecting them.\r\n\r\n     \"Yesterday morning I sent for Letafit Ali Khân, and desired him to\r\n     go to the Bhow Begum, and deliver the substance of my instructions\r\n     to her, which he did, and returned with the inclosed letter from\r\n     her. From some circumstances which I have heard to-day, I am\r\n     hopeful the prisoners will soon think seriously of their removal,\r\n     and pay the balance rather than submit themselves to an\r\n     inconvenient journey to Lucknow.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     _To Major Gilpin, commanding at Fyzabad, from Mr. Middleton._\r\n\r\n     \"Sir,--I have been favored with your letter of the 5th instant,\r\n     informing me of the steps you had taken in consequence of my\r\n     instructions of the 1st, and covering a letter from the Bhow Begum,\r\n     which is so unsatisfactory that I cannot think of returning an\r\n     answer to it. Indeed, as all correspondence between the Begum and\r\n     me has long been stopped, I request you will be pleased to inform\r\n     her that I by no means wish to resume it, or maintain any friendly\r\n     intercourse with her, until she has made good my claim upon her for\r\n     the balance due.\r\n\r\n     \"I have now, in conformity to my former instructions, to desire\r\n     that the two prisoners, Behar and Jewar Ali Khân, may be\r\n     immediately sent, under a sufficient guard, to Lucknow, unless,\r\n     upon your imparting to them this intimation, either they or the\r\n     Begum should actually pay the balance, or give you such assurances\r\n     or security for the assets to be immediately forthcoming as you\r\n     think can be relied upon; in which case you will of course suspend\r\n     the execution of this order.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Mr. Richard Johnson to Major Gilpin. Lucknow, 24th June, 1782._\r\n\r\n     \"Sir,--I have received the honor of your letter of the 20th. The\r\n     prisoners arrived here this morning. Lieutenant Crow has delivered\r\n     them over to Captain Waugh, and returns to you in a day or two.\r\n\r\n     \"I think their hint to you a very good one, and worth improving\r\n     upon. Was the Bhow Begum to think that she must go to Allahabad, or\r\n     any other place, while her palace is searched for the hidden\r\n     treasure of the late Vizier, it might go further than any other\r\n     step that can be immediately taken towards procuring payment of the\r\n     balance outstanding.\r\n\r\n     \"The prisoners are to be threatened with severities to-morrow, to\r\n     make them discover where the balance may be procurable, the fear of\r\n     which may possibly have a good effect; and the apprehensions of the\r\n     Begum lest they should discover the hidden treasure may induce her\r\n     to make you tenders of payment, which you may give any reasonable\r\n     encouragement to promote that may occur to you.\r\n\r\n     \"The jaghire cannot be released to her on any other terms, nor even\r\n     to the Nabob, until the five lacs for which it was granted be paid\r\n     up; and the prisoners must also be detained until the full fifty\r\n     lacs be liquidated: consequently nothing but the fear of an\r\n     increase of demand, upon breach of the first engagement on her\r\n     part, will induce her to prompt payment.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Letter from Mr. Richard Johnson to the Commanding Officer of the\r\n     Guard. Lucknow, 23d July, 1782._\r\n\r\n     \"Sir,--Some violent demands having been made for the release of the\r\n     prisoners, it is necessary that every possible precaution be taken\r\n     for their security. You will therefore be pleased to be very strict\r\n     in guarding them; and I herewith send another pair of fetters, to\r\n     be added to those now upon the prisoners.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Letter from Robert Steere Allen to Richard Johnson, Esq., Acting\r\n     Resident. Lucknow, 23d July, 1782._\r\n\r\n     \"Sir,--I have received your instructions, and ordered the fetters\r\n     to be added; but they are by much too small for their feet.

After all these cruelties, after all these menaces of further\r\ncruelties, after erecting a scaffold for actually exercising the last\r\ndegree of criminal punishment, namely, by whipping these miserable\r\npersons in public,--after everything has been done but execution, our\r\ninability to prove by evidence this part of their proceedings has\r\nsecured to your Lordships a circumstance of decorum observed on the\r\nstage where murders, executions, whippings, and cruelties are performed\r\nbehind the scenes. I know as certainly as a man can know such a thing,\r\nfrom a document which I cannot produce in evidence here, but I have it\r\nin the handwriting of the Resident, Mr. Bristow, that Behar Ali Khân was\r\nactually scourged in the manner that we speak of. I had it in writing in\r\nthe man's hand; I put the question to him, but he refused to answer it,\r\nbecause he thought it might criminate himself, and criminate us all; but\r\nif your Lordships saw the scaffold erected for the purpose, (and of\r\nthis we have evidence,) would you not necessarily believe that the\r\nscourging did follow? All this was done in the name of the Nabob; but if\r\nthe Nabob is the person claiming his father's effects, if the Nabob is\r\nthe person vindicating a rebellion against himself upon his nearest\r\nrelations, why did he not in person take a single step in this matter?\r\nwhy do we see nothing but his abused name in it? We see no order under\r\nhis own hand. We see all the orders given by the cool Mr. Middleton, by\r\nthe outrageous Mr. Johnson, by all that gang of persons that the\r\nprisoner used to disgrace the British name. Who are the officers that\r\nstormed their fort? who put on the irons? who sent them? who supplied\r\nthem? They are all, all, English officers. There is not an appearance,\r\neven, of a minister of the Nabob's in the whole transaction. The actors\r\nare all Englishmen; and we, as Englishmen, call for punishment upon\r\nthose who have thus degraded and dishonored the English name.\r\n\r\nWe do not use torture or cruelties, even for the greatest crimes, but\r\nhave banished them from our courts of justice; we never suffer them in\r\nany case. Yet those men, in order to force others to break their most\r\nsacred trust, inflict tortures upon them. They drag their poor victims\r\nfrom dungeon to dungeon, from one place of punishment to another, and\r\nwholly on account of an extorted bond,--for they owed no money, they\r\ncould not owe any,--but to got this miserable balance of 60,000_l._,\r\nfounded upon their tables of exchange: after they had plundered these\r\nladies of 500,000_l._ in money, and 70,000_l._ a year in land, they\r\ncould not be satisfied without putting usury and extortion upon tyranny\r\nand oppression. To enforce this unjust demand, the miserable victims\r\nwere imprisoned, ironed, scourged, and at last threatened to be sent\r\nprisoners to Chunar. This menace succeeded. The persons who had resisted\r\nirons, who had been, as the Begums say, refused food and water, stowed\r\nin an unwholesome, stinking, pestilential prison, these persons\r\nwithstood everything till the fort of Chunar was mentioned to them; and\r\nthen their fortitude gave way: and why? The fort of Chunar was not in\r\nthe dominions of the Nabob, whose rights they pretended to be\r\nvindicating: to name a British fort, in their circumstances, was to name\r\neverything that is most horrible in tyranny; so, at least, it appeared\r\nto them. They gave way; and thus were committed acts of oppression and\r\ncruelty unknown, I will venture to say, in the history of India. The\r\nwomen, indeed, could not be brought forward and scourged, but their\r\nministers were tortured, till, for their redemption, these princesses\r\ngave up all their clothes, all the ornaments of their persons, all their\r\njewels, all the memorials of their husbands and fathers,--all were\r\ndelivered up, and valued by merchants at 50,000_l._; and they also gave\r\nup 5,000_l._ in money, or thereabouts: so that, in reality, only about\r\n5,000_l._, a mere nothing, a sum not worth mentioning, even in the\r\ncalculations of extortion and usury, remained unpaid.\r\n\r\nBut, my Lords, what became of all this money? When you examine these\r\nwitnesses here, they tell you it was paid to Hyder Beg Khân. Now they\r\nhad themselves received the money in tale at their own assay-table. And\r\nwhen an account is demanded of the produce of the goods, they shrink\r\nfrom it, and say it was Hyder Beg Khân who received the things and sold\r\nthem. Where is Hyder Beg Khân's receipt? The Begums say (and the thing\r\nspeaks for itself) that even gold and jewels coming from them lost their\r\nvalue; that part of the goods were spoilt, being kept long unsold in\r\ndamp and bad warehouses; and that the rest of the goods were sold, as\r\nthieves sell their spoil, for little or nothing. In all this business\r\nMr. Hastings and Mr. Middleton were themselves the actors, chief actors;\r\nbut now, when they are called to account, they substitute Hyder Beg Khân\r\nin their place, a man that is dead and gone, and you hear nothing more\r\nof this part of the business.\r\n\r\nBut the sufferings of these eunuchs did not end here; they were, on\r\naccount of this odd 5,000_l._, confined for twelve months,--not\r\nprisoners at large, like this prisoner who thrusts his sore leg into\r\nyour Lordships' faces every day, but in harsh and cruel confinement.\r\nThese are the persons that I feel for. It is their dungeon, it is their\r\nunrevenged wrongs that move me. It is for these innocent, miserable,\r\nunhappy men, who were guilty of no offence but fidelity to their\r\nmistresses, in order to vex and torture whom (the first women in Asia)\r\nin the persons of their ministers these cruelties were exercised,--these\r\nare they for whom I feel, and not for the miserable sore leg or whining\r\ncant of this prisoner. He has been the author of all these wrongs; and\r\nif you transfer to him any of the sympathy you owe to these sufferers,\r\nyou do wrong, you violate compassion. Think of their irons. Has not this\r\ncriminal, who put on these irons, been without one iron? Has he been\r\nthreatened with torture? Has he been locked up without food and water?\r\nHave his sufferings been aggravated as the sufferings of these poor men\r\nwere aggravated? What punishment has been inflicted, and what can be\r\ninflicted upon him, in any manner commensurate with the atrocity of his\r\ncrimes?\r\n\r\nAt last, my Lords, these unhappy men were released. Mr. Bristow, who had\r\nbeen sent to Lucknow, writes to Mr. Hastings, and informs him that\r\nseverities could do no more, that imprisonments and menaces could get no\r\nmore money. I believe not, for I doubt much whether any more was to be\r\ngot. But whether there was or not, all the arts of extortion, fortified\r\nby all the arts of tyranny, of every name and species, had failed, and\r\ntherefore Mr. Bristow released the prisoners,--but without any warrant\r\nfor so doing from Mr. Hastings, who, after having received this letter\r\nfrom Mr. Bristow, gets the Supreme Council to order these very\r\nseverities to be continued till the last farthing was paid. In order to\r\ninduce the Council to sanction this measure, he suppressed Mr. Bristow's\r\ndeclaration, that severities could do nothing more in exacting further\r\npayments; and the Resident, I find, was afterwards obliquely punished\r\nfor his humanity by Mr. Hastings.\r\n\r\nMr. Bristow's letter is dated the 12th of December, and he thus writes.\r\n\r\n\"The battalion at Fyzabad\" (where the Begums and their ministers had\r\nbeen confined) \"is recalled, and my letter to the board of the 1st\r\ninstant has explained my conduct to the Begum. The letter I addressed\r\nher, a translation of which I beg leave to inclose, (No. 2,) was with a\r\nview of convincing her that you readily assented to her being freed from\r\nthe restraints which had been imposed upon her, and that your\r\nacquiescence in her sufferings was a measure of necessity, to which you\r\nwere forced by her extraordinary conduct. I wished to make it appear\r\nthis was a matter on which you directed me to consult the Vizier's\r\npleasure, that it might be known you were the spring from whence she was\r\nrestored to her dignity and consequence.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 3d of March following, the Council agree to send the following\r\norder to Mr. Bristow.\r\n\r\n\"We desire you will inform us if any and what means have been taken for\r\nrecovering the balance due from the Begum at Fyzabad, and, if necessary,\r\nthat you recommend it to the Vizier to enforce the most effectual means\r\nfor that purpose.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, you see the fraud he has put upon the Council. You will find\r\nthat Mr. Bristow's letters, up to the 3d of March, had been suppressed;\r\nand though then communicated, yet he instigated his cat's-paw, that\r\nblind and ignorant Council, to demand from the Vizier the renewal of\r\nthese very severities and cruelties, the continuance of which the\r\nletters in his pocket had shown him were of no effect. Here you have an\r\ninstance of his implacable cruelty; you see that it never relaxes, never\r\nremits, and that, finding all the resources of tyranny useless and\r\nineffective, he is still willing to use them, and for that purpose he\r\nmakes a fraudulent concealment of the utter inefficacy of all the means\r\nthat had been used.\r\n\r\nBut, you will ask, what could make him persevere in these acts of\r\ncruelty, after his avarice had been more than satiated? You will find it\r\nis this. He had had some quarrel with these women. He believed that they\r\nhad done him some personal injury or other, of which he nowhere informs\r\nyou. But, as you find that in the case of Cheyt Sing he considered his\r\nvisit to General Clavering as an horrid outrage against himself, which\r\nhe never forgave, and revenged to the ruin of that miserable person, so\r\nyou find that he has avowed the same malicious disposition towards the\r\nBegums, arising from some similar cause. In page 367 of your printed\r\nMinutes, he says,--\"I am sorry that I must in truth add, that a part of\r\nthe resentment of the Begums was, as I had too much reason to suspect,\r\ndirected to myself personally. The incidents which gave rise to it are\r\ntoo light to be mixed with the professed subject and occasion of this\r\ndetail; and as they want the authenticity of recorded evidence, I could\r\nlay no claim to credit in my relation of them. At some period I may be\r\ninduced to offer them to the world, my ultimate and unerring judges,\r\nboth of that and of every other trait in my political character.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, you have an anecdote here handed to you which is the key of a\r\ngreat part of this transaction. He had determined upon some deep and\r\ndesperate revenge for some injury or affront of some kind or other that\r\nhe thought he had received from these people. He accuses them of a\r\npersonal quarrel with himself; and yet he has not the honor or honesty\r\nto tell you what it was,--what it was that could induce them to\r\nentertain such a personal resentment against him as to ruin themselves\r\nand their country by their supposed rebellion. He says, that some time\r\nor other he will tell it to the world. Why did he not tell his counsel,\r\nand authorize them to tell a story which could not be unimportant, as it\r\nwas connected with a rebellion which shook the British power in India to\r\nits foundation? And if it be true that this rebellion had its rise in\r\nsome wicked act of this man, who had offended these women, and made\r\nthem, as he says, his mortal enemies, you will then see that you never\r\ncan go so deep with this prisoner that you do not find in every criminal\r\nact of his some other criminal act. In the lowest deep there is still a\r\nlower deep. In every act of his cruelty there is some hidden, dark\r\nmotive, worse than the act itself, of which he just gives you a hint,\r\nwithout exposing it to that open light which truth courts and falsehood\r\nbasely slinks from.\r\n\r\nBut cruelly as they have suffered, dreadfully as they have been robbed,\r\ninsulted as they have been, in every mode of insult that could be\r\noffered to women of their rank, all this must have been highly\r\naggravated by coming from such a man as Mr. Middleton. You have heard the\r\naudacious and insulting language he has held to them, his declining to\r\ncorrespond with them, and the mode of his doing it. There are, my Lords,\r\nthings that embitter the bitterness of oppression itself: contumelious\r\nacts and language, coming from persons who the other day would have\r\nlicked the dust under the feet of the lowest servants of these ladies,\r\nmust have embittered their wrongs, and poisoned the very cup of malice\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nOh! but they deserved it. They were concerned in a wicked, outrageous\r\nrebellion: first, for expelling their own son from his dominions; and,\r\nsecondly, for expelling and extirpating the English nation out of\r\nIndia.--Good God Almighty! my Lords, do you hear this? Do you understand\r\nthat the English nation had made themselves so odious, so particularly\r\nhateful, even to women the most secluded from the world, that there was\r\nno crime, no mischief, no family destruction, through which they would\r\nnot wade, for our extermination? Is this a pleasant thing to hear of?\r\nRebellion is, in all parts of the world, undoubtedly considered as a\r\ngreat misfortune: in some countries it must be considered as a\r\npresumption of some fault in government: _nowhere is it boasted of as\r\nsupplying the means of justifying acts of cruelty and insult, but with\r\nus_.\r\n\r\nWe have, indeed, seen that a rebellion did exist in Baraitch and\r\nGoruckpore. It was an universal insurrection of the people: an\r\ninsurrection for the very extermination of Englishmen,--for the\r\nextermination of Colonel Hannay,--for the extermination of Captain\r\nGordon,--for the extermination of Captain Williams, and of all the other\r\ncaptains and colonels exercising the office of farmer-general and\r\nsub-farmer-general in the manner that we have described. We know that\r\nthere did exist in that country such a rebellion. But mark, my Lords,\r\nagainst whom!--against these mild and gracious sovereigns, Colonel\r\nHannay, Captain Gordon, Captain Williams. Oh, unnatural and abominable\r\nrebellion!--But will any one pretend to say that the Nabob himself was\r\never attacked by any of these rebels? No: the attacks were levelled\r\nagainst the English. The people rose in favor of their lawful sovereign,\r\nagainst a rebellion headed by Mr. Middleton, who, you see, usurped his\r\nauthority,--headed by Colonel Hannay,--headed by Captain Gordon,--headed\r\nby all those abominable persons exercising, under the Nabob's name, an\r\nauthority destructive to himself and his subjects. Against them there\r\nwas a rebellion. But was this an unnatural rebellion,--a rebellion\r\nagainst usurped authority, to save the prince, his children, and state,\r\nfrom a set of vile usurpers?\r\n\r\nMy Lords, I shall soon close our proceeding for this day, because I wish\r\nto leave this part of our charge strongly and distinctly impressed upon\r\nyour Lordships' memory, and because nothing can aggravate it. I shall\r\nnext proceed, in the farther examination of the prisoner's defence, to\r\ndissipate, as I trust we have done, and as I hope we shall do, all the\r\nmiserable stuff they have given by way of defence. I shall often have\r\noccasion to repeat and press upon your Lordships that that miserable\r\ndefence is a heavy aggravation of his crime. At present, I shall\r\nconclude, leaving this part of our charge with the impression upon your\r\nLordships' minds that this pretended rebellion was merely an\r\ninsurrection against the English, excited by their oppression.\r\n\r\nIf the rebellion was against the Nabob, or if he was the author of the\r\noppression which caused it, why do the English only appear to be\r\nconcerned in both of them? How comes it that the Nabob never appears to\r\nhave expressed any resentment against the rebels? We shall prove beyond\r\na doubt, that the Begums had nothing to do with it. There was, indeed,\r\nas I have already said, what may be called a rebellion; but it was a\r\nrebellion against--not the Nabob, but in favor of the lawful prince of\r\nthe country,--against the usurpers of his authority and the destroyers\r\nof his country. With this, as a rebellion, Mr. Hastings has charged\r\nthese women; he has charged them with a war against their son, for the\r\npurpose of exterminating the English. Look, I pray you, at the whole\r\nbusiness, consider all the circumstances of it, and ask yourselves\r\nwhether this is not a charge, not only so grossly improbable, but so\r\nperfectly impossible, that there is not any evidence which can make it\r\neven plausible. Consider next, my Lords, on the other side, the evidence\r\nof their innocence, and then ask yourselves whether any additional\r\nmatter could make its probability in the least degree more probable. My\r\nLords, the evidence we have produced is neither more nor less than that\r\nof almost all the persons who have had a share in exciting that\r\nrebellion, and who, to justify their own horrible cruelty, have\r\nattempted to charge the natural consequences of that cruelty upon these\r\nunhappy women.\r\n\r\nBut where, all this time, is the Nabob, against whom this rebellion is\r\npretended to be directed? Was it ever even insinuated to him that his\r\nmother had raised a rebellion against him? When were the proofs shown to\r\nhim? Did he ever charge her with it? He surely must have been most\r\nanxious to prevent and suppress a rebellion against himself: but not one\r\nword on that subject has ever come out of his mouth; nor has any one\r\nperson been produced to show that he was informed of the existence of\r\nsuch a rebellion. The persons said to be rebels are his mother and\r\ngrandmother; and I again ask, Was there the least intimation given to\r\nhim by Mr. Middleton, or by any other person, of their being even\r\nsuspected of rebellion against him? There was, indeed, a hint of some\r\nrebellion, which the creatures of Mr. Hastings got at obliquely; but\r\nneither the person against whom the rebellion is supposed to exist, nor\r\nthe persons who were said to be guilty of it, were ever either informed\r\nof or charged with it. I defy the prisoner and his whole gang to produce\r\none word ever uttered by any one of them, from which the Nabob or\r\nBegums could learn that they were supposed to be concerned in the\r\nrebellion: so that none of those who were said to be the principal\r\nactors in the scene ever heard of the parts they were acting from the\r\nactual authors and managers of the business. Not one word was uttered of\r\na charge made, much less of proof given. Nothing was heard but \"Give me\r\nthe money!\"--irons,--new irons,--new imprisonment,--and at last the\r\ncastle of Chunar.\r\n\r\nAnd here I beg leave to pause, and to leave upon your minds the\r\nimpression, first, of the wrong that was done, the violence, and the\r\nrobbery,--and, secondly, of the pretences, both civil and criminal, by\r\nwhich they have attempted to justify their proceedings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH\r\n\r\nIN\r\n\r\nGENERAL REPLY.\r\n\r\nSIXTH DAY, WEDNESDAY, JUNE 11, 1794.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Lords,--Your Lordships will recollect that we closed the last day of\r\nyour proceeding in this trial at a most interesting part of our charge,\r\nor rather of our observations upon that charge. We closed at that awful\r\nmoment when we found the first women of Oude pillaged of all their\r\nlanded and of all their moneyed property, in short, of all they\r\npossessed. We closed by reciting to you the false pretence on which this\r\npillage was defended, namely, that it was the work of the Nabob. Now we\r\nhad before proved to you, from evidence adduced by the prisoner himself,\r\nthat this Nabob was a mere tool in his hands; and therefore, if this\r\npretence be true, it aggravates his guilt: for surely the forcing a son\r\nto violate the property of his mother must everywhere be considered a\r\ncrime most portentous and enormous. At this point we closed; and after\r\nthe detail which has been given you already of these horrible and\r\niniquitous proceedings, some apology may perhaps be necessary for\r\nentering again into the refutation of this iniquitous pretence.\r\n\r\nMy honorable fellow Manager who preceded me in this business did, in his\r\nremarks upon the inference drawn by the prisoner's counsel from the\r\nseizure of the Begums' treasures by the Nabob, as evidence of their\r\nguilt, as he ought to do,--he treated it with proper contempt. I\r\nconsider it, indeed, to be as little an evidence of their guilt as he\r\ndoes, and as little a defence of that seizure as he does. But I consider\r\nit in another and in a new light, namely, as a heavy aggravation of the\r\nprisoner's crimes, and as a matter that will let you into the whole\r\nspirit of his government; and I warn your Lordships against being\r\nimposed on by evasions, of which if it were possible for you to be the\r\ndupes, you would be unfit to be judges of the smallest matters in the\r\nworld, civil or criminal.\r\n\r\nThe first observation which I shall beg leave to make to your Lordships\r\nis this, that the whole of the proceedings, from beginning to end, has\r\nbeen a mystery of iniquity, and that in no part of them have the orders\r\nof the Company been regarded, but, on the contrary, the whole has been\r\ncarried on in a secret and clandestine manner.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary that your Lordships should be acquainted with the manner\r\nin which the correspondence of the Company's servants ought to be\r\ncarried on and their proceedings regulated; your Lordships, therefore,\r\nwill please to hear read the orders given concerning correspondence of\r\nevery kind with the country powers. You will remember the period when\r\nthese orders were issued, namely, the period at which the act passed for\r\nthe better direction of the servants of the Company. By this act Mr.\r\nHastings was appointed to be Governor-General, and the Court of\r\nDirectors was required by that act to prepare orders and instructions,\r\nwhich Mr. Hastings was required by the same act to comply with. You will\r\nsee what these instructions and orders were, and in what manner he has\r\ncomplied with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Extract of General Instructions to the Governor-General and\r\n     Council, 29th of March, 1774._\r\n\r\n     \"We direct that you assemble in Council twice every week, and that\r\n     all the members be duly summoned; that the correspondence with the\r\n     princes or country powers in India be carried on by the\r\n     Governor-General only, but that all letters sent by him be first\r\n     approved in Council, and that he lay before the Council, at their\r\n     next meeting, all letters received by him in the course of such\r\n     correspondence, for their information. We likewise direct that a\r\n     copy of such parts of the country correspondence be communicated to\r\n     our Board of Trade: (to be constituted as hereinafter mentioned) as\r\n     may any ways relate to the business of their department.\"\r\n\r\nYou will observe, my Lords, two important circumstances in these\r\ninstructions: first, that, after the board had regularly met, the\r\nPersian correspondence, kept by the Governor only, was to be\r\ncommunicated to the Council; and, secondly, that he should write no\r\nanswer to any part of the business until he had previously consulted the\r\nCouncil upon it. Here is the law of the land,--an order given in\r\npursuance of an act of Parliament. Your Lordships will consider how Mr.\r\nHastings comported himself with regard to those orders: for we charge it\r\nas a substantive crime, independent of the criminal presumptions arising\r\nfrom it, that he violated an act of Parliament which imposed direct\r\ninstructions upon him as to the manner in which he was to conduct all\r\nmatters of business with the native powers.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, we contend strongly that all the positive rules and\r\ninjunctions of the law, though they are merely positive, and do not\r\ncontain anything but mere matters of regulation, shall be strictly\r\nobserved. The reason is this, and a serious reason it is: official\r\ntyranny and oppression, corruption, peculation, and bribery are crimes\r\nso secret in their nature that we can hardly ever get to the proof of\r\nthem without the assistance of rules, orders, and regulations of a\r\npositive nature, intended to prevent the perpetration of these crimes,\r\nand to detect the offender in case the crimes should be actually\r\nperpetrated. You ought, therefore, to presume, that, whenever such rules\r\nor laws are broken, these crimes are intended to be committed; for you\r\nhave no means of security against the commission of secret crimes but by\r\nenforcing positive laws, the breach of which must be always plain, open,\r\nand direct. Such, for instance, is the spirit of the laws, that,\r\nalthough you cannot directly prove bribery or smuggling in a hundred\r\ncases where they have been committed, you can prove whether the proper\r\ndocuments, proper cockets, proper entries in regular offices have been\r\nobserved and performed, or not. By these means you lock the door against\r\nbribery, you lock the door against corruption, against smuggling and\r\ncontraband trade. But how? By falling upon and attacking the offence?\r\nNo, by falling upon and attacking the breach of the regulation. You\r\nprove that the man broke the regulation, and, as he could have no other\r\nmotive or interest in breaking it, you presume that he broke it\r\nfraudulently, and you punish the man not for the crime the regulation\r\nwas meant to prevent, but you punish him for the breach of the\r\nregulation itself.\r\n\r\nNext to the breach of these positive instructions, your Lordships will\r\nattend to the consequent concealment and mystery by which it was\r\naccompanied. All government must, to preserve its authority, be sincere\r\nin its declarations and authentic in its acts. Whenever in any matter of\r\npolicy there is a mystery, you must presume a fraud; whenever in any\r\nmatter of money there is concealment, you must presume misconduct: you\r\nmust therefore affix your punishment to the breach of the rule;\r\notherwise the conviction of public delinquents would be unattainable.\r\n\r\nI have therefore put before you that rule which he has violated; and we,\r\nthe Commons, call upon your Lordships to enforce that rule, and to\r\navenge the breach of it. You have seen the consequences of breaking the\r\nrule; and we have charged and do charge it as a heavy aggravation of\r\nthose consequences, that, instead of consulting the Council, instead of\r\nlaying the whole correspondence before them, instead of consulting them\r\nupon his answers, he went himself up into the country, took his\r\nMajesty's chief-justice along with him, and made that person the\r\ninstrument of those wrongs, violences, robberies, and concealments\r\nwhich we call upon your Lordships to punish.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, an extraordinary circumstance occurred in the course of our\r\nproceedings in another place, which I must state, to show you in what a\r\nhorrible manner your laws have been trampled upon and despised. None of\r\nthe proceedings which have been last stated to your Lordships respecting\r\nthe seizure of the treasures of the Begums appear upon any public record\r\nwhatever. From the manner in which they came to our knowledge, your\r\nLordships will perceive what must have been the prisoner's own opinion\r\nof the horrible nature of proceedings which he thought so necessary to\r\nbe concealed.\r\n\r\nWhilst we were inquiring into the violences committed against the\r\nBegums, in breach of the treaty entered into with them, there came into\r\nmy hands an anonymous letter containing a full account of all the matter\r\nwhich has lately been stated to you. It came anonymously; and I did not\r\nknow from what quarter it came. I do not even know with certainty at\r\nthis hour: I say, not with certainty, for I can only form a conjecture.\r\nThis anonymous communication enabled us to produce all the\r\ncorrespondence with Mr. Middleton respecting the cruelties exercised\r\ntowards the Begums and their eunuchs in order to extort money. We found\r\nthe names of Major Gilpin and several other persons in these letters. We\r\nalso found in them a strong fox smell of a Sir Elijah Impey, that his\r\nbrush and crime had left behind him; we traced him by that scent; and as\r\nwe proceeded, we discovered the footsteps of as many of the wolves as\r\nMr. Hastings thought proper to leave there. We sent for and examined Mr.\r\nMiddleton, and Major Gilpin produced his correspondence. When we applied\r\nto Mr. Middleton, we found that all this part of his correspondence had\r\nbeen torn out of his book; but having come at it by means of our\r\nanonymous communication, we subsequently proved and established it, in\r\nthe manner we have done before your Lordships. Here, then, you have\r\nimportant matter which this anonymous letter has brought to light; and\r\notherwise the whole of this correspondence, so essential to the\r\ninterests and justice of Great Britain, would have been concealed by\r\nthis wicked man. Thus, I say, his violation of a positive law would have\r\nremained undiscovered, if mere accident had not enabled us to trace this\r\niniquity to its source. Therefore I begin our proceedings this day by\r\nstating to your Lordships this fact, and by calling upon your justice to\r\npunish him for this violation of the laws of his country.\r\n\r\nWe have told you who the instruments were by which all this wickedness\r\nwas committed, Mr. Middleton and Mr. Johnson, persons who were sent as\r\nambassadors to represent the interests of the Company at the court of an\r\nindependent prince. Over this prince they usurped an absolute power;\r\nthey even made use of British officers in his own service and receiving\r\nhis pay, to enslave his person, and to force him to rob his kindred.\r\nThese agents were aided by an English chief-justice, sent under the\r\nauthority of an act of Parliament to represent the sovereign majesty of\r\nEnglish justice, and to be a restraint upon the misconduct of the\r\nCompany's servants. These are the instruments with which this man works.\r\nWe have shown you his system; we have shown you his instruments: we will\r\nnow proceed with the examination of the pretences upon which this horrid\r\nand nefarious act is attempted to be justified. We have not entered into\r\nthis examination for the sake of refuting things that want no\r\nrefutation, but for the purpose of showing you the spirit of the whole\r\nproceeding, and making it appear to your Lordships, as I trust it will\r\nappear, that the wicked act done there is not half so bad as the wicked\r\ndefence made here.\r\n\r\nThe first part of Sir Elijah Impey's commission, as your Lordships will\r\nremember, was to seize upon the Begums' treasures. He had likewise\r\nanother budget of instructions, which has been discovered in the trunks\r\nof which your Lordships have heard,--secret instructions to be given by\r\nhim to Mr. Middleton for the furtherance of this business. And that his\r\noffice of Chief-Justice should not lie dormant, he was commissioned to\r\nseek for affidavits or written testimony from any persons, for the\r\npurpose of convicting these women of a design of atrociously revolting\r\nagainst their son, and deposing him from the government, with a view of\r\ngetting rid of the English inhabitants. This was the accusation; and the\r\nevidence to support it Sir Elijah Impey was sent to collect.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, I must here observe to your Lordships that there is no act of\r\nviolence which, merely as an act of violence, may not in some sort be\r\nborne: because an act of violence infers no principle; it infers nothing\r\nbut a momentary impulse of a bad mind, proceeding, without law or\r\njustice, to the execution of its object. For at the same time that it\r\npays no regard to law, it does not debauch it, it does not wrest it to\r\nits purposes: the law disregarded still exists; and hope still exists in\r\nthe sufferer, that, when law shall be resorted to, violence will cease,\r\nand wrongs will be redressed. But whenever the law itself is debauched,\r\nand enters into a corrupt coalition with violence, robbery, and wrong,\r\nthen all hope is gone; and then it is not only private persons that\r\nsuffer, but the law itself, when so corrupted, is often perverted into\r\nthe worst instrument of fraud and violence; it then becomes most odious\r\nto mankind, and an infinite aggravation of every injury they suffer.\r\n\r\nWe have therefore in our charge strongly reprobated Sir Elijah Impey's\r\ngoing to take such affidavits. \"Oh! but,\" they say, \"a judge may take an\r\naffidavit in his chamber privately; and he may take an affidavit, though\r\nnot exactly in the place of his jurisdiction, to authenticate a bond, or\r\nthe like.\"--We are not to be cheated by words. It is not dirty shreds of\r\nworn-out parchments, the sweepings of Westminster Hall, that shall serve\r\nus in place of that justice upon, which the world stands. Affidavits! We\r\nknow that in the language of our courts affidavits do not signify a body\r\nof evidence to sustain a criminal charge, but are generally relative to\r\nmatter [matters?] in process collateral to the charge, which, not coming\r\nbefore the jury, are made known to the judge by way of affidavit.\r\n\r\nBut was it ever heard, or will it be borne, that a person exercising a\r\njudicial office under his Majesty should walk beyond the sphere of his\r\njurisdiction,--that he should desert the station in which he was placed\r\nfor the protection of the natives, and should march to such a place as\r\nLucknow in order to take depositions for criminating persons in that\r\ncountry, without so much as letting these poor victims know one article\r\nin the depositions so taken? These depositions, my Lords, were made to\r\ncriminate, they were meant to justify a forfeiture, and are not in the\r\nnature of those voluntary affidavits which, whether made within\r\njurisdiction or without, whether made publicly or privately, signify\r\ncomparatively nothing to the cause. I do not mean, to say that any\r\nprocess of any court has not its weight, when the matter is within it in\r\nthe ordinary course of proceedings: it is the extraordinary course, the\r\nextrajudicial conduct, which divests it of that just weight it otherwise\r\nwould have.\r\n\r\nThis chief-justice goes to Lucknow, where he holds his court, such as it\r\nwas. He is ready to authenticate any process by the signature of the\r\nEnglish chief-justice, in a court which he holds by night, in a court\r\nwhich he holds in darkness and secrecy. He holds his court in Fyzabad;\r\nhe holds it, unknown to the Nabob of Oude, in his own capital, and\r\nwithout giving him the least knowledge of or any notice of what he was\r\nproceeding to do. He holds it at the lodgings of Colonel Morgan, a\r\npensioner of the Nabob; and the person assisting him is Mr. Middleton,\r\nwho is likewise, as we have proved to you, one of the Nabob's\r\npensioners, a monopolizer of trade in the country, and a person who\r\nreceived much the major part of his emoluments from the Nabob's hands.\r\n\r\nIn that clandestine manner, in the Nabob's own house, in his own capital\r\ncity, in the lodging of his dependant and pensioner, Colonel Morgan,\r\nwith no other witness that we know of than Mr. Middleton, was this\r\niniquitous, dark procedure held, to criminate the mother of the Nabob.\r\nWe here see a scene of dark, mysterious contrivance: let us now see what\r\nis brought out in the face of open day. The attestations themselves,\r\nwhich you have seen on the record before you. They were brought\r\nout--where? there? No: they were brought out in another place; they were\r\nbrought out at Calcutta,--but were never communicated to the Nabob. He\r\nnever knew anything of the matter. Let us now see what those\r\nattestations were. Your Lordships will bear in mind that I do not advert\r\nto this thing, which they bring as evidence, in the way of imputation of\r\nits being weak, improper, and insufficient evidence, but as an\r\nincontrovertible proof of crimes, and of a systematic design to ruin\r\nthe accused party, by force there and by chicane here: these are the\r\nprinciples upon which I am going to talk to you upon this abominable\r\nsubject,--of which, I am sorry to say, I have no words sufficient to\r\nexpress my horror. No words can express it; nor can anything but the\r\nseverity of your Lordships' judgments find an adequate expression of it.\r\nIt is not to be expressed in words, but in punishment.\r\n\r\nHaving stated before whom the evidence collected in this body of\r\naffidavits was taken, I shall now state who the persons were that gave\r\nit. They were those very persons who were guilty of robbing and ruining\r\nthe whole country: yes, my Lords, the very persons who had been accused\r\nof this in the mass by Mr. Hastings himself. They were nothing less than\r\nthe whole body of those English officers who were usurping the office of\r\nfarmers-general, and other lucrative offices in the Nabob's government,\r\nand whose pillage and peculations had raised a revolt of the whole\r\nkingdom against themselves. These persons are here brought in a mass to\r\nclear themselves of this charge by criminating other persons, and\r\nclandestinely imputing to them the effect of their own iniquity.\r\n\r\nBut supposing these witnesses to be good for anything, supposing it fit\r\nthat the least attention should be paid them, the matter of their\r\ntestimony may very possibly be true without criminating the Begum. It\r\ncriminates Saadut Ali Khân, the brother of the Nabob; the word Begum is\r\nnever mentioned in the crimination but in conjunction with his; and much\r\nthe greater part of it criminates the Nabob himself. Now, my Lords, I\r\nwill say, that the matter of these affidavits, forgetting who the\r\ndeponents were, may possibly be true, as far as respects Saadut Ali\r\nKhân, but that it is utterly as improbable, which is the main point and\r\nthe stress of the thing, with respect to the Begums, as it is impossible\r\nwith respect to the Nabob. That Saadut Ali, being a military man, a man\r\nambitious and aspiring to greatness, should take advantage of the abuses\r\nof the English government and of the discontent of the country, that he\r\nshould, I say, raise a revolt against his brother is very possible; but\r\nit is scarcely within possibility that the mother of the Nabob should\r\nhave joined with the illegitimate son against her legitimate son. I can\r\nonly say that in human affairs there is the possibility of truth in\r\nthis. It is possible she might wish to depose her legitimate son, her\r\nonly legitimate son, and to depose him for the sake of a bastard son of\r\nher husband's,--to exalt him at the expense of the former, and to exalt,\r\nof course, the mother of that bastard at her own expense, and to her own\r\nwrong. But I say, that this, though possible, is grossly improbable. The\r\nreason why the Begum is implicated in this charge with Saadut Ali by the\r\naffidavits cannot escape your notice. Their own acquittal might be the\r\nonly object of the deponents in their crimination of the latter; but the\r\ntreasures of the former were the objects of their employers, and these\r\ntreasures could not be come at but by the destruction of the Begums.\r\n\r\nBut, my Lords, there are other affidavits, or whatever your Lordships\r\nmay call them, that go much further. In order to give a color to the\r\naccusation, and make it less improbable, they say that the Nabob himself\r\nwas at the bottom of it, and that he joined with his brother and his\r\nmother to extirpate out of his dominions that horrible grievance, the\r\nEnglish brigade officers,--those English officers who were the\r\nfarmers-general, and who, as we have proved by Mr. Hastings's own\r\nevidence, had ruined the country. Nothing is more natural than that a\r\nman, sensible of his duty to himself and his subjects, should form a\r\nscheme to get rid of a band of robbers that were destroying his country\r\nand degrading and ruining his family. Thus you see a family compact\r\nnaturally accounted for: the Nabob at the head of it, his mother joining\r\nher own son, and a natural brother joining in the general interests of\r\nthe family. This is a possible case. But is this the case pressed by\r\nthem? No: they pass lightly over the legitimate son; they scarcely touch\r\nupon Saadut Ali Khân; they sink the only two persons that could give\r\nprobability or possibility to this business, and endeavor to throw the\r\nwhole design upon these two unfortunate women.\r\n\r\nYour Lordships see the wickedness and baseness of the contrivance. They\r\nfirst, in order to keep the whole family in terror, accuse the whole\r\nfamily; then, having possessed themselves of the treasures of the Begums\r\nupon another pretence, they endeavor to fix upon them that improbable\r\nguilt which they had with some degree of probability charged upon the\r\nwhole family, as a farther justification of that spoliation. Your\r\nLordships will see what an insult is offered to the Peers of Great\r\nBritain, in producing before you, by way of defence, such gross,\r\nscandalous, and fraudulent proceedings.\r\n\r\nWho the first set of witnesses were which they produced before their\r\nknight-errant chief-justice, Sir Elijah Impey, who wandered in search of\r\na law adventure, I have laid open to your Lordships. You have now had\r\nan account of the scandalous manufacture of that batch of affidavits\r\nwhich was in the budget of Sir Elijah Impey,--that Pandora's box which I\r\nhave opened, and out of which has issued every kind of evil. This\r\nchief-justice went up there with the death-warrant of the Begums'\r\ntreasures, and, for aught he knew, the death-warrant of their persons.\r\nAt the same time that he took these affidavits he became himself a\r\nwitness in this business; he appears as a witness. How? Did he know any\r\none circumstance of the rebellion? No, he does not even pretend to do\r\nso. \"But,\" says he, \"in my travels I was obliged to avoid Fyzabad, upon\r\naccount of the suspected rebellion there.\" Another chief-justice would\r\nhave gone fifty miles about to avoid Lucknow, for everybody knows that\r\nLucknow was the focus and centre of extortion, corruption, and\r\npeculation, and that a worse air for the lungs of a chief-justice could\r\nnot be found in the world. If his lungs wanted the benefit of pure air,\r\nhe would even have put himself in the focus of a rebellion, to have kept\r\nat a distance from the smell of carrion and putrid corruption of every\r\nkind that was at Lucknow. A chief-justice may go to a place where a\r\nrebellion is raging, he may die a martyr to his honor; but a\r\nchief-justice who puts himself into the focus of peculation, into the\r\nfocus of bribery, into the focus of everything that is base and\r\ncorrupt,--what can we expect from him but that he will be engaged in\r\nclandestine jobs there? The former might kill Sir Elijah Impey, the\r\nknight-errant, but the chief-justice would remain pure and entire;\r\nwhereas Sir Elijah Impey has escaped from Lucknow, and the chief-justice\r\nis left by Mr. Hastings to shift for himself.\r\n\r\nAfter mentioning this violation of the laws of hospitality by Sir Elijah\r\nImpey, I would ask, Was any notice given by him, or by any of Mr.\r\nHastings's agents, to the Nabob, who was so immediately interested in\r\nthis matter? Was any notice given to the Begums that any such charge was\r\nentertained against them? Not a word. Was it notified to the eunuchs?\r\nWas it to Saadut Ali Khân? Not a word. They were all within their power.\r\nThe eunuchs were a year in irons, and they were subjected to the want of\r\nfood and water for a part of that year. They were dragged from Fyzabad\r\nto Lucknow, and from Lucknow to Fyzabad. During all that time was there\r\na word mentioned to them by any one person on the part of Mr. Hastings,\r\nthat they were accused of this matter? Not a word.\r\n\r\nWe now submit to your Lordships' vindictive justice and condemnation\r\nthis recriminatory defence, in which every principle of justice has been\r\nviolated. And now I will ask your Lordships whether you would have\r\nsuffered such a procedure in the case of the prisoner at your bar. It\r\nwas asked by a person of great authority in this House, when we were\r\ngoing to produce certain evidence against Mr. Hastings, (we do not say\r\nwhether we offered to produce it properly or improperly,--that is\r\nanother matter,)--we were asked, I say, whether our intentions of\r\nproducing that evidence had been communicated to Mr. Hastings. Had he\r\nhad an opportunity of cross-examining the witnesses who had given that\r\nevidence? No, he added, that evidence must be rejected. Now I say to\r\nyour Lordships, upon the same ground, deal with the Begums as you dealt\r\nwith Mr. Hastings. Do not keep two weights and measures for different\r\npersons in the same cause. You would not suffer such evidence to be\r\nproduced against him; you will not assuredly suffer such evidence to be\r\nproduced to you in his favor and against them.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, the cause between this man and these unfortunate women is at\r\nlast come into Westminster Hall; the cause is come to a solemn trial;\r\nand we demand other witnesses and other kinds of proof than what these\r\naffidavits furnish. My Lords, the persons who have been examined here\r\nare almost all of them the same persons who made these affidavits; but\r\nthere is this material difference in their evidence: at your Lordships'\r\nbar they sunk all those parts of their former evidence which criminated\r\nthe Nabob and Saadut Ali, and confined their testimony wholly to what\r\nrelated to the Begums. We were obliged, by a cross-examination, to\r\nsqueeze out of them the disavowal of what they had deposed on the former\r\noccasion. The whole of their evidence we leave to the judgment of your\r\nLordships, with these summary remarks: first, that they are the persons\r\nwho were to profit by their own wrong; they are the persons who had\r\nseven months' arrears paid to them out of the money of these unfortunate\r\nladies; they are the persons who, to justify the revolt which they had\r\ncaused in the country by their robbery, charge their own guilt upon\r\nothers. The credibility of their evidence is therefore gone. But if it\r\nwere not affected by these circumstances, Mr. Hastings has put an end to\r\nit by telling you that there is not one of them who is to be credited\r\nupon his oath,--no, not in a court-martial; and can it, therefore, be\r\nexpected that in a case of peculation they will do otherwise than acquit\r\nthe party accused? He has himself laid before you the horrible state of\r\nthe whole service; your Lordships have it fresh in your memories, and\r\nringing in your ears. You have also heard from witnesses brought by Mr.\r\nHastings himself, that these soldiers committed misdemeanors of the very\r\nsame kind with those which we have stated. They ought not, therefore, to\r\nbe listened to for a moment; and we aver that it is an aggravation of\r\nthe prisoner's crimes, that he has brought the instruments of his guilt,\r\nthe persons of whom he has complained as having ruined and destroyed\r\nthat country, and whom he had engaged, at the Nabob's desire, in the\r\ntreaty of Chunar, to send out of the country, as being a nuisance in\r\nit,--to bring, I say, these people here, to criminate, at a distance of\r\nnine thousand miles, these unfortunate women, where they have neither\r\nattorney or agent who can from local knowledge cross-examine them. He\r\nhas the audacity to bring these people here; and in what manner they\r\ncomport themselves, when they come here, your Lordships have seen.\r\n\r\nThere is one of them whom we cannot pass by: that is, Captain Gordon.\r\nThe other witnesses, who appeared here as evidences to criminate the\r\nBegums, did it by rumors and hearsays. They had heard some person say\r\nthat the Begums had encouraged rebellion, always coupling them with\r\nSaadut Ali Khân, and sometimes with the Nabob, because there might have\r\nbeen some probability for their charge in the transactions with Saadut\r\nAli Khân, which, though impossible with regard to the Begums, they\r\nthought would implicate him [them?] in his designs. But Captain Gordon\r\nis to give a different account of the proceedings.\r\n\r\nCaptain Gordon was one of Colonel Hannay's under-farmers. He was hunted\r\nout of the country and, as one of the Begums says, pursued by a\r\nthousand of the zemindars, for robbing the whole country. This woman,\r\nthrough respect to the British name, that name which guarantied her\r\npossessions to her, receives this Captain Gordon and Captain Williams\r\nwith every mark of kindness, hospitality, and protection, that could be\r\ngiven them. She conveys them from the borders to the city of Fyzabad,\r\nand from Fyzabad, her capital, supposed to be the nest of her rebellion,\r\non to their place of destination. They both write her letters full of\r\nexpressions of gratitude and kindness for the services that they had\r\nreceived. They then pass on to Lucknow to Sir Elijah Impey, and there\r\nthey sink every word of kindness, of any service or protection that they\r\nhad received, or of any acknowledgment that they had ever made of it.\r\nThey sink all this: not one word of it appears in their affidavits.\r\n\r\nHow, then, did we come to the knowledge of it? We got it from Major\r\nGilpin, who was examined in the course of these proceedings; and we used\r\nit in our charge, from the papers that we hold in our hands. Mr.\r\nHastings has confessed the fact; and Mr. Middleton has endeavored to\r\nslur it over, but could not completely conceal it. We have established\r\nthe fact, and it is in evidence before your Lordships.\r\n\r\nYou have now, then, in this manner, got these testimonials given by\r\nEnglish officers in favor of these women; and by the same means the\r\nletters of the latter accusing the former are come to your hands: and\r\nnow these same English officers come here with their recriminatory\r\naccusation. Now why did they not make it at Lucknow? Why did not Mr.\r\nHastings, when Mr. Middleton had such papers for him in his hands, why,\r\nI ask, did not Mr. Hastings procure some explanation of the\r\ncircumstances whilst he was in India? I will read your Lordships the\r\nletter, that you may not only know, but feel, the iniquity of this\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Letter from the Mother of the Vizier to Mr. Hastings; received the\r\n     6th of January, 1782._\r\n\r\n     \"Our situation is pretty well, and your good health is constantly\r\n     prayed for. I had sent Behar Ali Khân to you. Accordingly people\r\n     invented a falsehood, that Behar Ali Khân was gone to get the\r\n     deputyship of the Subah; and some persons here were saying,\r\n     'Wherefore has she sent Behar Ali Khân to Calcutta to the Nabob\r\n     Amaud ul Dowlah? We will never permit the affair to succeed.' And\r\n     accordingly it has so happened. For they say that you also have not\r\n     put your seal to the treaty: and the people here say, 'Why does the\r\n     noble lady correspond with the English gentlemen?' On this account,\r\n     I did not send a letter at the time when you came this way. Now the\r\n     state of affairs here is thus. On the 27th Zehedja, Asoph ul Dowlah\r\n     Banadur, without my knowledge, sent his own aumils into my\r\n     jaghires. I accordingly wrote several times to Mr. Middleton on\r\n     this business: that his seal was to the treaty and writing of\r\n     discharge; why did he not negotiate in my favor? Mr. Middleton\r\n     replied, 'The Nabob is the master.' I wrote frequently, but without\r\n     effect. Being helpless, I represent to you the state of my affairs,\r\n     that, notwithstanding the existence of this treaty, I have been\r\n     treated in this manner. It is useless for me to stay here. Whatever\r\n     is is a compact; whenever any one deviates from his compact, he\r\n     meets with no credit for the future; and the light of mine eyes,\r\n     Asoph ul Dowlah, wrote to me that he had sent his own aumils into\r\n     my jaghires, and would pay ready money from his treasury. Reflect\r\n     on my security for his adhering to his future engagements, from the\r\n     consideration of his conduct under his past promises. I do not\r\n     agree to his ready money. Let me have my jaghires as formerly;\r\n     otherwise, leaving this place, I will wait on you at Benares, and\r\n     thence will go towards Shahjehanabad, because he has not adhered to\r\n     his engagement. Send letters to Asoph ul Dowlah, and to Mr.\r\n     Middleton, and Hussein Reza Khân, and Hyder Beg Khân, not to molest\r\n     the Begum's jaghires, and to let them remain, as formerly, with the\r\n     Begum's aumils. And it is here suspected of me that my aumil\r\n     plundered the property of Mr. John Gordon. The case is this. Mr.\r\n     John Gordon arrived at Taunda, a jaghire of mine, fighting with the\r\n     zemindars of Acberpore, which belongs to the Khalseh. Accordingly,\r\n     Mr. John Gordon having come to Taunda, my aumil performed whatever\r\n     appertained to his duty. Afterwards Mr. John Gordon wrote to me to\r\n     send my people, that he might come with them to Fyzabad. I sent\r\n     people accordingly to bring Mr. John Gordon, and the said gentleman\r\n     arrived here in complete safety; and Mr. John Gordon is now\r\n     present. Ask him yourself of these matters. Mr. John Gordon will\r\n     represent matters in detail; the truth will then become known, how\r\n     ill-founded the calumny is. Should you come here for a few days, it\r\n     will be very well, and if not, I will wait on you; and your coming\r\n     here is very necessary, that all my affairs may become arranged.\r\n     And send a speedy answer to my letters, and a letter to Asoph ul\r\n     Dowlah, and Mr. Middleton, and Hussein Reza Khân, and Hyder Beg\r\n     Khân, on the subject of ceasing to molest my jaghires. And send me\r\n     constantly news of your health, for my peace of mind depends\r\n     thereon.\"\r\n\r\nThis letter was transmitted to Mr. Hastings. I desire your Lordships\r\nwill remark upon this letter, for it is a most important one indeed. It\r\nis hardly worth observing that all this correspondence came out of the\r\nvarious trunks of which your Lordships have already heard, and that this\r\nletter is out of the trunk of Mr. Hastings's private Persian secretary\r\nand interpreter, Mr. Jonathan Scott. Now, my Lords, in this letter there\r\nare several things worthy of your Lordships' observation. The first is,\r\nthat this woman is not conscious of having ever been accused of any\r\nrebellion: the only accusation that ever came to her ears was, that\r\nCaptain Gordon said that his baggage had been robbed by one of her\r\naumils. She denies the truth of this charge; and she produces\r\ntestimonials of their good behavior to him; and, what is the essential\r\npoint of all, she desires Mr. Hastings to apply to this Mr. John Gordon,\r\nand to know from him what truth or falsehood there is in that\r\naccusation, and what weight there is in the attestation she produces.\r\n\"Mr. Gordon is now present,\" says she; \"ask him yourself of these\r\nmatters.\" This reasonable request was not complied with. Mr. Gordon\r\nswears before Sir Elijah Impey to the robbery; but he never mentions the\r\npaper he had written, in which he confessed that he owed his life to\r\nthis very lady. No inquiry was made into this matter. Colonel Hannay\r\nwas then alive. Captain Gordon was alive, and she refers to him: yet\r\nthat very man was sworn before Sir Elijah Impey, and accuses his\r\nprisoner. Did the prisoner at your bar make that attestation known to\r\nthe Begum, whose letter at that very time was in his possession, in Mr.\r\nScott's trunk,--that very letter in which he is desired to make the\r\ninquiry from Captain Gordon?\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings is acquainted with the facts stated by the Begum, and with\r\nCaptain Gordon's accusation. Did he afterwards inform her of this\r\naccusation? or did he ask this Captain Gordon one question in India,\r\nwhere the matter might be ventilated? Not one word, my Lords. Therefore\r\nwe fix upon him fraud, deceit, and the production of false evidence,\r\nafter the woman had desired to have the man who was the evidence against\r\nher examined upon the spot. This he does not do, but with much more\r\nprudence he brings him here. And for what? To discredit his own\r\ntestimony, and the written evidence. And how does he discredit them?\r\nThere are two of these papers, which I beg leave to read to your\r\nLordships.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Copy of a Letter to Jewar and Behar Ali Khân, from Mr. Gordon._\r\n\r\n     \"Sirs, my indulgent friends, remain under, &c., &c., &c. After\r\n     compliments, I have the pleasure to inform you, that yesterday,\r\n     having taken leave of you, I passed the night at Noorgunge, and\r\n     next morning about ten or eleven o'clock, through your favor and\r\n     benevolence, arrived safe at Goondah. Mir Aboo Buksh Zemindar and\r\n     Mir Rustum Ali accompanied me.\r\n\r\n     \"To what extent can I prolong the praises of you, my beneficent\r\n     friends? May the Supreme Being, for this benign, compassionate,\r\n     humane action, have you in His keeping, and increase your property,\r\n     and speedily grant me the pleasure of an interview; until which\r\n     time continue to favor me with friendly letters, and oblige me by\r\n     any commands in my power to execute. May your wishes be ever\r\n     crowned with success! My compliments,\" &c., &c., &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Copy of an Address from Mr. Gordon to the Begum._\r\n\r\n     \"Begum Saib of exalted dignity and generosity, whom God preserve!\r\n     After presenting the usual professions of servitude, &c., in the\r\n     customary manner, my address is presented.\r\n\r\n     \"Your gracious letter, in answer to the petition of your servant\r\n     from Goondah, exalted me. From the contents, I became unspeakably\r\n     impressed with the honor it conferred. May the Almighty protect\r\n     that royal purity, and bestow happiness, increase of wealth, and\r\n     prosperity! The welfare of your servant is entirely owing to your\r\n     favor and benevolence; a few days have elapsed since I arrived at\r\n     Goondah, with the Colonel Saib.\r\n\r\n     \"This is presented for your Highness's information. I cherish hopes\r\n     from your generosity, that, considering me in the light of one of\r\n     your servants, you will always continue to exalt and honor me with\r\n     your gracious letters. May the sun of prosperity continually\r\n     shine!\"\r\n\r\nThese acknowledgments of the Begum's friendly disposition and services\r\nwere concealed, when the charge was made against this woman at Lucknow\r\nbefore Sir Elijah Impey: I wish to impress this upon your Lordships'\r\nmind; and that before Mr. Hastings left Bengal, in the trunk of Major\r\nScott, his private Persian interpreter, was this letter. Did he make\r\nthat inquiry of Captain Gordon? No. Did he make that inquiry of Colonel\r\nHannay? Did he make any inquiry into the matter, after his perusal of\r\nthese letters? Or did he give this poor woman any opportunity of\r\nobtaining justice against this Captain Gordon, who, after acknowledging\r\nthat he owed his life to her favor, calumniates and traduces her to her\r\nutter destruction? No, he never did; and therefore he is chargeable, and\r\nI charge him, with everything that is wrongful in Captain Gordon's\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\nThese papers, which carry with them a clear refutation of all the\r\ncharges against the Begum, are never once produced, though Captain\r\nGordon was referred to expressly for inquiry and explanation of the\r\nwhole transaction by the woman herself. You hear nothing of them; there\r\nis no appearance of them in the affidavits; no such papers were laid\r\nbefore the Supreme Council; none were transmitted to the Court of\r\nDirectors: but at last the House of Commons having come at the truth of\r\nthis matter, Mr. Hastings, not daring to deny the existence of these\r\npapers, brings Captain Gordon to be examined here, in order to prove\r\nthat papers which he had himself written were false. Is this to be\r\ntolerated? What will your Lordships think of a man that comes to attest\r\nhis own infamy,--to declare that he has written papers containing\r\nfalsehoods, and to invalidate the false testimony which he had before\r\ngiven? Is he to be suffered, I say, to come here, and endeavor to prove\r\nthe absolute falsity of his own deeds by his own evidence?\r\n\r\nThe next point for your Lordships' consideration is the evidence which\r\nhe produces to prove the falsity of a paper written by himself. Why, he\r\nhimself is the sole evidence. And how does he prove it? Why, says he,\r\n\"The reason of my writing that letter was this: she had sent a person\r\nwith me as an escort, and this person was desirous of receiving some\r\nproof that he had done his duty; and therefore I wrote a complaisant\r\nletter. I meant nothing by it. It was written merely to satisfy the mind\r\nof the man.\" Now is that the way in which formal and solemn letters,\r\nwritten upon great occasions to great people, are to be explained away?\r\nIf he had said nothing but \"Your servant, such a one, has done his\r\nduty,\" this explanation might pass. But you see it has another\r\ncomplexion. It speaks of his owing his life to her. But if you admit\r\nthat it is possible (for possibilities have an unknown extent) that he\r\nwrote such a letter at such a time and for such a purpose, and that the\r\nletter he wrote was false, and that the falsity of the letter is proved\r\nby his own testimony given in an affidavit which we have also reason to\r\nbelieve is false, your Lordships must at the same time admit that it is\r\none of the most complex pieces of fraud and falsehood that, I believe,\r\never existed in the world. But it is worse than all this. There is\r\nanother letter, written some days after, which I will read to you, and\r\nwhich he has not pretended to say was written only to testify that a\r\nmessenger had executed his commission properly.\r\n\r\n\"Your gracious letter,\" (he thus writes,) \"in answer to the petition of\r\nyour servant from Goondah, exalted me. From the contents, I became\r\nunspeakably impressed with the honor it conferred.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, this letter was not sent back by a messenger, in\r\nacknowledgment of his having done his duty, but was written in\r\nconsequence of a correspondence in the nature of a petition for\r\nsomething or other which he made to the Begum. That petition they have\r\nsuppressed and sunk. It is plain, however, that the petition had been\r\nsent, and was granted; and therefore the apology that is made for the\r\nformer letter does not apply to this letter, which was written\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\nHow, then, do they attempt to get rid of this difficulty? Why, says\r\nCaptain Gordon, \"_The Colonel Saib_ (by whom was meant Colonel Hannay)\r\nwas not at Goondah, as stated in the letter, but at Succara, about\r\neighteen miles from it, and therefore you ought not to pay much regard\r\nto this paper.\" But he does not deny the letter, nor was it possible for\r\nhim to deny it. He says Colonel Hannay was not there. But how do we know\r\nwhether Colonel Hannay was there or not? We have only his own word for\r\nit. But supposing he was not there, and that it was clearly proved that\r\nhe was eighteen miles distant from it, Major Naylor was certainly with\r\nCaptain Gordon at the time. Might not his Persian scribe (for he does\r\nnot pretend to say he wrote the letter himself) take Major Naylor for a\r\ncolonel, (for he was the superior officer to Captain Gordon,) and think\r\nhim the Colonel Saib? For errors of that kind may be committed in our\r\nown country. Every day we may take a major for a lieutenant-colonel.\r\nThis was an error that might easily have happened in such a case. He was\r\nin as high rank as Colonel Hannay; for Colonel Hannay at that time was\r\nonly a major. I do not believe either of them was properly entitled to\r\nthe name of Colonel Saib. I am ashamed, my Lords, to be obliged to\r\nremark upon this prevarication. Their own endeavors to get rid of their\r\nown written acts by contradictory evidence and false constructions\r\nsufficiently clear these women of the crimes of which they were accused;\r\nand I may now ask the prisoner at your bar how he dares to produce\r\nCaptain Gordon here, how he dares thus to insult the Peers, how he dares\r\nthus to insult the public justice of his country, after not having dared\r\nto inquire, upon the spot, of this man, to whom he was referred by the\r\nBegums for an account of this very transaction?\r\n\r\nI hope your Lordships have got enough of this kind of evidence. All the\r\nrest is of the same batch, and of the same description,--made up of\r\nnothing but hearsays, except in one particular only. This I shall now\r\nmention to your Lordships. Colonel Popham and another gentleman have\r\ntold you, that, in a battle with Cheyt Sing's forces, they took\r\nprisoners two wounded nudjeeves or swordsmen, and that these men told\r\nthem that they were sent there by the Begums,--that they had got two\r\nrupees and two wounds, but that they thought two rupees a bad\r\ncompensation for two wounds. These two men, with their two wounds and\r\ntwo rupees, had, however, been dismissed. It does not appear that this\r\naccident was considered by these officers to be of consequence enough to\r\nmake them ever tell one word of it to Mr. Hastings, though they knew he\r\nwas collecting evidence of the disaffection of the Begums, of all kinds,\r\ngood, bad, and indifferent, from all sorts of persons.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, I must beg leave to say a few words upon this matter; because\r\nI consider it as one of the most outrageous violations of your\r\nLordships' dignity, and the greatest insult that was ever offered to a\r\ncourt of justice. A nudjeeve is a soldier armed with a sword. It appears\r\nin evidence that the Nabob had several corps of nudjeeves in his\r\nservice; that the Begums had some nudjeeves; and that Colonel Hannay had\r\na corps of nudjeeves. It is well known that every prince in Hindostan\r\nhas soldiers of that description,--in like manner, probably, as the\r\nprinces of Europe have their guards. The whole, then, amounts to this:\r\nthat a story told by two men who were wounded in an action far from the\r\nplace from which they were supposed to come, who were not regularly\r\nexamined, not cross-examined, not even kept for examination, and whose\r\nevidence was never reported, is to be a reason why you are to believe\r\nthat these Begums were concerned in a rebellion against their son, and\r\ndeserved to forfeit all their lands and goods, and to suffer the\r\nindignities that we have stated.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, I am really ashamed to mention so scandalous a thing; but let\r\nus put a case: let us suppose that we had accused Mr. Hastings of\r\ninstigating the Rajah of Berar to fall upon some of the country powers,\r\nand that the evidence we produced at your bar to prove it was, that an\r\nofficer had taken two nudjeeves, who declared they were instigated by\r\nMr. Hastings to go into the service of that Rajah: could you bear such a\r\nthing? would you suffer such evidence to be produced? or do you think\r\nthat we should have so little regard for our own reputation as to\r\nventure to produce such evidence before you? Again, we have charged Mr.\r\nHastings with committing several acts of violence against the Begums.\r\nLet us suppose our proof to be, that two persons who never appeared\r\nbefore nor since, that two grenadiers in English uniforms, (which would\r\nbe a great deal stronger than the case of the nudjeeves, because they\r\nhave no particular uniform belonging to them,) that two English\r\ngrenadiers, I say, had been taken prisoners in some action and let go\r\nagain, who said that Mr. Hastings had instigated them to make war upon\r\nthe Begums: would your Lordships suffer such evidence to be produced\r\nbefore you? No. And yet two of the first women in India are to be\r\nstripped of all they have in the world upon no better evidence than that\r\nwhich you would utterly reject. You would not disgrace the British\r\npeerage, you would not disgrace this court of justice, you would not\r\ndisgrace human reason itself, by confiscating, on such evidence, the\r\nmeanest property of the meanest wretch. You would not subject to the\r\nsmallest fine for the smallest delinquency, upon such evidence. I will\r\nventure to say, that, in an action of assault and battery, or in an\r\naction for the smallest sum, such evidence would be scouted as odious\r\nand contemptible, even supposing that a perfect reliance might be placed\r\nupon its truth. And yet this is the sort of evidence upon which the\r\nproperty, the dignity, and the rank of some of the first persons in Asia\r\nare to be destroyed,--by which a British guaranty, and the honor and\r\ndignity of the crown of Great Britain, and of the Parliament itself,\r\nwhich sent out this man, are to be forfeited.\r\n\r\nObserve, besides, my Lords, that the two swordsmen said they were sent\r\nby the Begums. Now they could not be sent by the Begums in their own\r\nperson. This was a thing in India impossible. They might, indeed, have\r\nbeen sent by Jewar and Behar Ali Khân: and then we ask again, How came\r\nthese ministers not to be called to an account at the time? Why were\r\nthey not called upon for their muster-rolls of these nudjeeves? No,\r\nthese men and women suffer the penalty, but they never hear the\r\naccusation nor the evidence.\r\n\r\nBut to proceed with the evidence of this pretended rebellion. Captain\r\nWilliams has told your Lordships that he once had a great number of\r\nletters and papers to prove this rebellion of the Begums. But he\r\ndeclares that he has lost all these letters. A search was ordered to be\r\nmade in Mr. Hastings's record-office, called a trunk; and accordingly in\r\nthe trunk is found a paper worthy of such a place and such a cause. This\r\nletter, which has been made use of to criminate the Begums, has not\r\ntheir names mentioned, nor is there any possibility of their being\r\nincluded in it. By this paper which is preserved you may judge of the\r\nwhole of the papers that are lost. Such a letter, I believe, was never\r\nbefore brought as evidence in a court of justice. It is a letter said to\r\nhave been intercepted, and is as follows.\r\n\r\n     \"To the most noble * * * * *, whose prosperity be everlasting!\r\n\r\n     \"It is represented, that the august purwannah [command], having\r\n     completed his honorable arrival on the 16th of the month in the\r\n     evening, highly exalted me. It is ordered that I should charge\r\n     Medeporee, and the other enrolled sepoys belonging to my district,\r\n     and take bonds from them that none of them go for service to the\r\n     Rajah; and that, when four or five hundred men, nudjeeves and\r\n     others, are collected, I should send them to the presence.\r\n     According to the order, I have written to Brejunekar Shah Rehemet\r\n     Ullah, who is in Bhooaparah, charging him to take bonds from them,\r\n     and that whatever sepoys fit for service are collected he should\r\n     send to the presence. As at this time the wind is contrary, the\r\n     sepoys will not * * * * without travelling charges; for I have\r\n     learnt from a letter previously received from Brejunekar Shah\r\n     Rehemet Ullah, that the people there also are badly inclined. By\r\n     the grace of God, the unalterable glory shall be * * * * *. Zehan\r\n     Beg and the nudjeeves who were in the fort of Aneelah have gone off\r\n     to Goruckpore.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a letter of somebody or other employed by somebody or other for\r\nthe recruiting service,--it should seem, by the word \"presence,\"\r\nsomebody employed in enlisting forces for the Nabob. The charge against\r\nthe Begum was, that she had joined with the rebellious Rajahs to\r\nexterminate her son's government and the English influence in that\r\ncountry. In this very paper you see that the soldiers entering into that\r\nservice, and officers who are to contract for soldiers, are expressly\r\nbound not to join the Rajahs; and this they produce as proof that the\r\nBegums had joined the Rajahs, and had joined them in a rebellion, for\r\nthe purpose of exterminating their son, in the first instance, and the\r\nEnglish afterwards.\r\n\r\nThere is another circumstance which makes their own acts the refutation\r\nof their false pretences. This letter says that the country is\r\ndisaffected, and it mentions the ill-disposed parts of the country. Now\r\nwe all know that the country was ill-disposed; and we may therefore\r\nconclude this paper was written by, and addressed to, some person who\r\nwas employed against the persons so ill-disposed,--namely, the very\r\nRajahs so mentioned before. The prisoner's counsel, after producing this\r\npaper, had the candor to declare that they did not see what use could be\r\nmade of it. No, to be sure, they do not see what use can be made of it\r\nfor their cause; but I see the use that can be made of it against their\r\ncause. I say that the lost papers, upon which they do so much insist,\r\ndeserve no consideration, when the only paper that they have preserved\r\noperates directly against them; and that therefore we may safely infer,\r\nthat, if we had the rest of the contents of this trunk, we should\r\nprobably find them make as strongly against them as this paper does. You\r\nhave no reason to judge of them otherwise than by the specimen: for how\r\ncan you judge of what is lost but from what remains?\r\n\r\nThe man who hid these papers in his trunk never understood one word of\r\nthe Persian language, and consequently was liable to every kind of\r\nmistake, even though he meant well. But who is this man? Why, it is\r\nCaptain Williams,--the man who in his affidavits never mentioned the\r\nBegums without mentioning Saadut Ali. It is Captain Williams,--whom we\r\ncharge to have murdered a principal man of the country by his own hand,\r\nwithout law or legal process. It is Captain Williams,--one of those\r\nBritish officers whom Mr. Hastings states to be the pests of the\r\ncountry. This is the man who comes here as evidence against these women,\r\nand produces this monstrous paper.\r\n\r\nAll the evidence they had produced to you amounts to no more than that\r\nsuch a man _believes_ such a man _heard of something_; and to close the\r\nwhole of this hearsay account, Sir Elijah Impey, who always comes in as\r\na supplement, declares that no man doubted of the existence of this\r\nrebellion, and of the guilt of the Begums, any more than of the\r\nrebellion of 1745: a comparison which, I must say, is, by way of\r\nevidence, a little indecorous in a chief-justice of India. Your\r\nLordships are sufficiently acquainted with the history of that rebellion\r\nto know, that, when Lord Lovat was tried at this bar, the proceedings\r\nagainst him were not founded on second-hand hearsay. The existence of\r\nthe rebellion of 1745 was proved, notwithstanding its notoriety; but\r\nneither notoriety nor proof would have signified anything, if Lord\r\nLovat's participation in it had not been brought home to him directly,\r\npersonally, and particularly. Yet a chief-justice, sent to India to\r\nrepresent the sacred majesty of the crown of England, has gone so far as\r\nto say at your bar that no more doubt could be entertained of the\r\nexistence either of the rebellion or the guilt of the Begums than of the\r\nrebellion in 1745. Besides, he forgets that he himself carried the order\r\nto confiscate these people's property without any trial whatever. But\r\nthis is the way of proceeding by an English chief-justice in India,--a\r\nchief-justice who had rendered himself the instrument, the\r\nletter-carrier, the messenger, I had almost said the executioner of Mr.\r\nHastings.\r\n\r\nFrom this view of the whole matter your Lordships will form an estimate\r\nof the spirit of Indian government and Indian justice. But to blow away\r\nand to put an end to all their false pretences, their hearsays, and talk\r\nof nudjeeves, and wounds, and the like, I ask, Who is the first witness\r\nthat we have produced upon this occasion? It is the Nabob himself,\r\nnegativing all these pretences. Did he believe them? Not a word from him\r\nof any rebellion, actual or suspected. Sir Elijah Impey, indeed, said\r\nthat he was obliged to wheel round, and to avoid that dangerous place,\r\nFyzabad. His friends urged him to this. \"For God's sake,\" say they,\r\n\"have a reverend care of your sacred person! What will become of the\r\njustice of India, what will become of the natives, if you, their\r\nlegitimate protector, should fall into the hands of these wicked,\r\nrebellious women at Fyzabad?\" But although the Chief-Justice does this,\r\nthe Nabob, whose deposition is said to be the first object of this\r\nrebellion, takes leave of Mr. Hastings at the very moment when it is\r\nraging in the highest possible degree, and gallops into its very focus.\r\n\r\nAnd under what circumstances does he do this? He had brought some\r\nconsiderable forces with him. No man of his rank in that country ever\r\ngoes without them. He left a part of these forces with Mr. Hastings,\r\nnotwithstanding he was going into the centre of the rebellion. He then\r\nwent on with a corps of about a thousand horse. He even left a part of\r\nthese with Mr. Middleton, and galloped, attended by a few horse, into\r\nthe very capital, where the Begums, we are told, had ten thousand armed\r\nmen. He put himself into their power, and, not satisfied with this, the\r\nvery first thing we hear of him after his arrival is, that he paid his\r\nmother a friendly visit,--thus rushing into the den of a lioness who was\r\ngoing to destroy her own whelp. Is it to be credited, my Lords, that a\r\nprince would act thus who believed that a conspiracy was formed against\r\nhim by his own mother? Is it to be credited that any man would trust a\r\nmother who, contrary to all the rules of Nature and policy, had\r\nconspired to destroy her own son?\r\n\r\nUpon this matter your Lordships have the evidence of Captain Edwards,\r\nwho was aide-de-camp to the Nabob, who was about his person, his\r\nattendant at Chunar, and his attendant back again. I am not producing\r\nthis to exculpate the Begums,--for I say you cannot try them here, you\r\nhave not the parties before you, they ought to have been tried on the\r\nspot,--but I am going to demonstrate the iniquity of this abominable\r\nplot beyond all doubt: for it is necessary your Lordships should know\r\nthe length, breadth, and depth of this mystery of iniquity.\r\n\r\nCaptain Edwards being asked,--\"Whether he ever heard any native of\r\ncredit and authority in the Nabob's dominions, who appeared to believe\r\nthe rebellion of the Begums?--_A._ No, I never did.--_Q._ Have you any\r\nreason to believe that the Nabob gave credit to it?--_A._ I really\r\ncannot rightly presume to say whether the Nabob did or did not; but I am\r\napt to believe that he did not.--_Q._ Have you any reason, and what, to\r\nform a belief about it?--_A._ I have. I think, if he supposed the\r\nrebellion, ever existed at Fyzabad, he would have been the first person\r\nto take and give the alarm to the British troops.--_Q._ And no such\r\nalarm was taken or given to the British troops?--_A._ No, I think not:\r\nas I was always about his person, and in the camp, I think I certainly\r\nmust have known it or heard of it; but I never did.\"\r\n\r\nWe assure your Lordships, you will find upon your printed Minutes, that\r\nCaptain Edwards says he was credibly informed that the Nabob left behind\r\nhim a part of his guard of horse; and that, so desirous was he to go\r\ninto the power of this cruel lioness, his mother, that he advanced, as\r\nhe is a vigorous man, and a bold and spirited rider, leaving all his\r\nguards behind him, and rode before them into the middle of Fyzabad.\r\nThere is some more evidence to the same purpose in answer to the\r\nquestion put next to that which I read before.\r\n\r\n\"_Q._ When you did hear of the rebellion, did not you understand it to\r\nhave been alleged that one object of it was to dethrone the Nabob\r\nhimself, as well as to extirpate the English?--_A._ I understood that\r\nthe intention of the princesses, the Begums, was to extirpate the\r\nEnglish troops out of the country and out of those dominions, and\r\nlikewise to depose her son, and set another son, who seems to have been\r\na greater favorite of that family, upon the throne, in the room of the\r\npresent Nabob; and that son's name is Saadut Ali. I have only heard this\r\nfrom report. I have no other knowledge but mere report. I understood\r\nfrom the report, she was to extirpate the English, and depose her son\r\nwho is now upon the throne.--_Q._ Was it after or before the seizing of\r\nthe treasures, that you heard a circumstantial account of the supposed\r\nobject of the rebellion?--_A._ The report was more general after the\r\nseizing of the treasures; but yet there were reports prevailing in the\r\nneighborhood that our troops were sent there in consequence of the\r\ncharge that was made by Colonel Hannay and some of his officers of\r\nrebellion existing then at Fyzabad, or having existed, I cannot rightly\r\nsay which.--_Q._ Was that report after the order for the troops to march\r\nto Fyzabad?--_A._ It was more general, it was very general then when the\r\ntroops did march there, and more general after the seizing of the\r\ntreasures.--_Q._ When did the troops first march?--_A._ It was some time\r\nin the month of January, I believe, in the year 1782.--_Q._ While you\r\nwas with the Nabob in passing from Lucknow to Chunar, and while you was\r\nwith him or the army returning from Chunar, did you then, out of the\r\nwhole army, regular or irregular, ever hear of any report of the Begums\r\nbeing in rebellion?--_A._ No, I do not recollect I ever did.--_Q. (Upon\r\ncross-examination.)_ Do you recollect at what time in August, 1781, you\r\nleft Lucknow to proceed with the Nabob to Chunar?--_A._ No, I cannot\r\nrightly mention the date: all that I know is this, that I accompanied\r\nthe Nabob, Mr. Middleton, and his attendants, all the way from Lucknow\r\nto Chunargur. I really cannot recollect; I have no notes, and it is so\r\ndistant a time since that I do not recollect the particulars of the\r\nmonth or the day; but I recollect perfectly I accompanied the Nabob all\r\nthe way from Lucknow to Chunar, and returned again with him until he\r\nstruck off on the road for Fyzabad.\"\r\n\r\nYour Lordships see plainly the whole of this matter. When they had\r\nresolved to seize the Begums' treasures, they propagated this report\r\njust in proportion to their acts. As they proceeded, the report grew\r\nhotter and hotter. This man tells you when it was that the propagation\r\nof this report first began, when it grew hot, and when it was in its\r\ngreatest heat. He tells you that not one native of credit in the country\r\nbelieved it,--that he did not think the Nabob himself believed it; and\r\nhe gives a reason that speaks for itself, namely, that he, the Nabob,\r\nwould have been the first man to give the alarm, if he believed in a\r\nrebellion, as he was to be the object of it. He says the English were\r\nthe principal spreaders of the report. It was, in fact, a wicked report,\r\npropagated by Mr. Middleton and the English agents for the purpose of\r\njustifying their iniquitous spoliation of the Begums.\r\n\r\nThis is the manner in which the matter stands upon the ground of\r\nrebellion, with the exception of Major Gilpin's and Hyder Beg Khân's\r\ntestimony. This last man we have proved to have been kept in his office\r\nby Mr. Hastings's influence, and to have been entirely under his\r\ngovernment. When this dependant comes to give his attestation, he gives\r\na long account of all the proceedings of Cheyt Sing's rebellion, with\r\nwhich the rebellion charged on the Begums was supposed to be coincident;\r\nand he ends it very remarkably,--that he tells the whole truth, and\r\nnothing but the truth. But it is also remarkable, that even this Hyder\r\nBeg Khân never mentions by name the rebellion of the Begums, nor says\r\nthat he ever heard a word about it: a strong proof that he did not dare,\r\nin the face of his country, to give countenance to such a falsehood.\r\n\r\nMajor Gilpin's evidence leaves not even the shadow of a pretence for\r\nthis charge. He had the Begums and their eunuchs under his custody for a\r\nfull year; he was strictly ordered to watch them and to guard them; and\r\nduring all that time he lived at Fyzabad. He was the man who commanded\r\nthe troops, who had all the witnesses in his power, who had daily access\r\nto all parties at Fyzabad, and who, moreover, was a person attached to\r\nMr. Hastings in the strongest manner. Your Lordships will now be pleased\r\nto hear read to you this part of Major Gilpin's evidence.\r\n\r\n\"_Q._ Had you any opportunity of knowing the character of the Begums,\r\nand whether they were disaffected to our government?--_A._ I had a very\r\ngood opportunity of knowing, from the circumstance of my having\r\ncommanded so long there. The elder Begum, it was generally understood,\r\n(and I have reason to believe,) was disaffected to our government; and\r\nmy sentiments of her conduct stand recorded in my correspondence to the\r\ncourt of Lucknow to that effect; but with respect to the Bhow Begum, I\r\nacquit her entirely of any disaffection to our government, so far as\r\ncomes to my knowledge: appearances were for some time against her; but,\r\non cool, deliberate inquiry, I found there was no ground for supposing\r\nher guilty of any rebellious principles, at the time of Cheyt Sing's\r\nrebellion.--_Q._ Whether that, according to your belief, is not your\r\npresent opinion?--_A._ I think I have answered that very fully, that it\r\nwas upon those very principles that I did form an opinion of her\r\ninnocence; how far they are justifiable or right I will not take upon me\r\nto say upon oath; there was no one circumstance that came to my\r\nknowledge, during my residence at Fyzabad or my residence in India, that\r\nI would wish to withhold from your Lordships.--_Q._ You state here,\r\n'upon cool, deliberate inquiry': what was that cool, deliberate\r\ninquiry?--_A._ That cool, deliberate inquiry was the conversations I had\r\nwith the ministers and the people of Fyzabad, and the letters from\r\nherself expressing her innocence; and it appeared to me from those\r\nletters that she really was our friend and ally.\"\r\n\r\nThe same witness goes on afterwards to say:--\r\n\r\n\"_Q._ I understood you to say, that originally the report prevailed with\r\nrespect to both the Begums, but that you was induced to alter that\r\nopinion with respect to the younger Begum, in consequence of Mr.\r\nGordon's letters, and the intelligence of some of her ministers and\r\nother persons: were not those other persons in the interest of the\r\nyounger Begum?--_A._ In general the town of Fyzabad were in her\r\ninterest.--_Q._ In what sense do you mean generally in her interest?\r\nWere the persons you conversed with merely those who were in her service\r\nand household, or the inhabitants of Fyzabad in general?--_A._ Both: I\r\nheld conversations with both her own body-servants and the inhabitants\r\nof the city.\"\r\n\r\nA little lower down, in the same page:--\r\n\r\n\"_Q._ What do you mean by the word rebellion, as applied to the Begums?\r\nIn what sense do you use it?--_A._ In raising troops, and in other acts\r\nof rebellion, in the common acceptation of the word.--_Q._ Against\r\nwhom?--_A._ Against the Nabob's government and the British government\r\njointly: but I beg to know the particular time and circumstance the\r\nquestion alludes to.--_Q._ I understand you to have said you understood\r\nthe elder Begum was in a constant state of rebellion. In what sense do\r\nyou use the word rebellion? Did you say the elder Begum was in a\r\nconstant state of rebellion?--_A._ I always understood her to be\r\ndisaffected to the English government: it might not be a proper\r\nexpression of mine, the word rebellion.--_Q._ Do you know of any act by\r\nthe elder Begum against the Vizier?--_A._ I cannot state any.--_Q._ Do\r\nyou know of any act which you call rebellion, committed by the elder\r\nBegum against the Company?--_A._ I do not know of any particular\r\ncircumstance, only it was generally supposed that she was disaffected to\r\nthe Company.--_Q._ What acts of disaffection or hostility towards the\r\nEnglish do you allude to, when you speak of the conversation of the\r\nworld at the time?--_A._ I have answered that question as fully as I\r\ncan,--that it was nothing but conversation,--that I knew of no\r\nparticular act or deed myself.\"\r\n\r\nThis man, then, declares, as your Lordships have heard, that, upon cool,\r\ndeliberate inquiry made at Fyzabad from all the inhabitants, he did not\r\nbelieve in the existence of any rebellion;--that as to the Bhow Begum,\r\nthe grandmother, who was a person that could only be charged with it in\r\na secondary degree, and as conspiring with the other, he says he knows\r\nno facts against her, except that at the battle of Buxar, in the year\r\n1764, she had used some odd expressions concerning the English, who were\r\nthen at war with her son Sujah Dowlah. This was long before we had any\r\nempire or pretence to empire in that part of India: therefore the\r\nexpression of a rebellion, which he had used with regard to her, was, he\r\nacknowledged, improper, and that he only meant he had formed some\r\nopinion of her disaffection to the English.\r\n\r\nAs to the Begum, he positively acquits her of any rebellion. If he,\r\ntherefore, did not know it, who was an active officer in the very centre\r\nof the alleged rebellion, and who was in possession of all the persons\r\nfrom whom information was to be got, who had the eunuchs in prison, and\r\nmight have charged them with this rebellion, and might have examined and\r\ncross-examined them at his pleasure,--if this man knew nothing about it,\r\nyour Lordships will judge of the falsehood of this wicked rumor, spread\r\nabout from hand to hand, and which was circulated by persons who at the\r\nsame time have declared that they never heard of it before Sir Elijah\r\nImpey went up into the country, the messenger of Mr. Hastings's orders\r\nto seize the treasures of the Begums, and commissioned to procure\r\nevidence in justification of that violence and robbery.\r\n\r\nI now go to another part of this evidence. There is a person they call\r\nHoolas Roy,--a man in the employment of the Resident, Mr. Middleton. The\r\ngentlemen who are counsel for the prisoner have exclaimed, \"Oh! he was\r\nnothing but a news-writer. What! do you take any notice of him?\" Your\r\nLordships would imagine that the man whom they treat in this manner, and\r\nwhose negative evidence they think fit to despise, was no better than\r\nthe writers of those scandalous paragraphs which are published in our\r\ndaily papers, to misrepresent the proceedings of this court to the\r\npublic. But who in fact is this Hoolas Roy, whom they represent, for the\r\nconvenience of the day, to be nothing but a news-writer? I will read to\r\nyour Lordships a letter from Major Naylor to Colonel Jaques, commanding\r\nthe second battalion, twentieth regiment.\r\n\r\n     \"Sir,--Hoolas Roy, the person appointed by the Nabob for\r\n     transacting the business for which the troops are required here,\r\n     will hold constant communication and intercourse with you; and as\r\n     he is instructed and acquainted with the best method to accomplish\r\n     this business, Mr. Middleton requests implicit attention to be paid\r\n     to what he may from time to time represent respecting the prisoners\r\n     or the business on which he is employed; in short, as he is the\r\n     person nominated by the Nabob, he wishes Hoolas Roy to be\r\n     considered in the same light as if he himself was present.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Middleton, in a letter to Lieutenant Francis Rutledge, writes thus\r\nof him:--\r\n\r\n     \"Sir,--When, this note is delivered to you by Hoolas Roy, I have to\r\n     desire that you order the two prisoners to be put in irons, keeping\r\n     them from all food, &c., agreeable to my instructions of\r\n     yesterday.\"\r\n\r\nYou will first see in how confidential a manner Hoolas Roy was employed,\r\nand in what light he was held: that he was employed to carry some\r\ninstructions which do not indeed appear, but were accompanied by an\r\norder from Mr. Middleton. \"When these instructions shall come to you, to\r\nput these prisoners in irons and keep them without food, &c.\" The Begums\r\nsay, without food and water. _Et cetera_ are words of large import; but\r\nhe was \"to keep them without food, &c., agreeable to my instructions of\r\nyesterday.\" This was a pretty general warrant for sufferings. This\r\nHoolas Roy, this mere news-writer, was not only intrusted with this\r\nwarrant, but Mr. Middleton declares him to be a person who was to be\r\nreceived there, and to represent the Nabob, and very justly too; for he,\r\nMr. Middleton, was undoubtedly the real nabob of the country. The man,\r\ntherefore, whom they talk of in this contemptuous manner in order to\r\nmake slight of an observation we made, and which I shall make again, and\r\nwhom they affect to consider as a mere paragraph-monger in some\r\nscandalous newspaper, was a man vested by Mr. Middleton with authority\r\nequal to that of the Nabob himself.\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings not only thought him of consequence enough to be a witness\r\nto the severities used on the ministers of the Begums, but he considered\r\nthat he would afterwards be a fit witness to the rebellion. I pray your\r\nLordships to mark this: he sent for this Hoolas Roy, (who is now nothing\r\nbut a mere paragraph-monger,)--he sent for him from Fyzabad to\r\nBenares,--a pretty long journey; and at last caused him to be examined\r\nbefore Sir Elijah Impey. He has, however, sunk his evidence: a\r\nsuppression which is strongly in favor of the Begums, and equally strong\r\nagainst their accuser. Here we have a man who was intrusted with all\r\ntheir orders,--who represented the English government,--who represented\r\nthe Nabob's government: this man is sent for by Mr. Hastings; he gives\r\nhis deposition before Sir Elijah Impey; and the deposition so given is\r\nnot to be found either upon the Company's record, in Sir Elijah Impey's\r\ntrunk, in Jonathan Scott's trunk, nor in any other place whatever. The\r\nevidence of a witness who could speak most clearly, as probably he did,\r\nand most decisively, upon this subject, is sunk. They suppress, and dare\r\nnot produce, the affidavit of the man who was at the bottom of every\r\nsecret of both governments. They had the folly to let you know,\r\nobliquely, that he had been sent for by Mr. Hastings, but they conceal\r\nthe information obtained from him: a silence more damning than any\r\npositive evidence could be. You have here a proof of their practice of\r\nproducing such evidence only as they thought most favorable to their\r\nwicked purposes, in the destruction of this great and ancient family.\r\n\r\nBut all the English, they say, believed in the existence of this\r\nrebellion. This we deny. Mr. Purling, who was Resident the year before\r\nits pretended explosion, has told you that he never knew of anything\r\nlike a plot carrying on by these women. We were almost ashamed to put\r\nthe question to him. Did Mr. Bristow, the next Resident, know or\r\nbelieve in this plot? He seems, indeed, to have been induced to give\r\nsome oblique hints to Mr. Hastings of improper conduct on the part of\r\nthe Begums, but without stating what it was. In a letter to Mr.\r\nHastings, he appears to endeavor to soften the cruel temper of this\r\ninflexible man by going a little way with him, by admitting that he\r\nthought they had behaved improperly. When Mr. Wombwell, another\r\nResident, is asked whether any Englishman doubted of it, he says Mr.\r\nBristow doubted of it. No one, indeed, who reads these papers, can avoid\r\nseeing that Mr. Bristow did not believe one word of it,--no more, in\r\nfact, than did Mr. Hastings, or anybody else.\r\n\r\nBut, my Lords, let us go from these inferior agents and servants of the\r\nCompany to their higher officers. Did Mr. Stables believe it? This\r\ngentleman was Mr. Hastings's colleague in the Council,--a man of as\r\nmuch honor, I really believe, as ever went to India,--a faithful old\r\nservant of the Company, and very worthy of credit. I believe there is\r\nnot a spot upon him during all his long service under the Company: if\r\nany, it is his being a little too obsequious, sometimes, to Mr.\r\nHastings. Did he believe it? No, he did not: and yet he was one of the\r\npersons authorized to investigate it coolly, and most able to do so.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, then, the persons who best knew the state of the country\r\ndid not believe it; the Nabob did not believe it; the Begums were never\r\ncharged with it; no ground of suspicion is suggested, except loose\r\nrumors and the story of two nudjeeves. Under these circumstances the\r\ntreasures of these ancient ladies were seized, their property\r\nconfiscated, and the Nabob dragged most reluctantly to this act. Yes,\r\nmy Lords, this poor, miserable victim was forced to violate all the laws\r\nof Nature, all decency, all property, to rob his own mother, for the\r\nbenefit of Mr. Hastings. All this he was forced to do: he was made the\r\nreluctant instrument of punishing his mother and grandmother for a plot\r\nof which even their accusers do not pretend to say that the parties\r\naccused had ever received any intimation.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, in forming your judgment upon this nefarious proceeding, your\r\nLordships will not fail to advert to the fundamental principles, the\r\nacknowledged maxims and established rules, of all judgment and\r\njustice,--that conviction ought to precede execution, that trial ought\r\nto precede conviction, and that a prosecutor's information and evidence\r\nought to be the preliminary step and substance of the trial. Here\r\neverything was reversed: Sir Elijah Impey goes up with the order for\r\nexecution; the party accused is neither arraigned nor tried; this same\r\nSir Elijah then proceeds to seek for witnesses and to take affidavits;\r\nand in the mean time neither the Nabob, the ostensible prosecutor, nor\r\nhis mother and grandmother, the parties accused, knew one word of the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nBut possibly some peculiarity in the circumstances of the case rendered\r\nsuch a proceeding necessary, and may justify it. No such peculiarity has\r\nbeen proved or even alleged; nay, it is in the highest degree improbable\r\nthat it could have existed. Mr. Hastings had another opportunity of\r\ndoing himself justice. When an account of this business was transmitted\r\nto the Court of Directors, they ordered him to inquire into it: and your\r\nLordships will see what he did in consequence of this order. Your\r\nLordships will then judge of the extreme audacity of the defence which\r\nhe has made of this act at your bar, after having refused to institute\r\nany inquiry into it, although, he had the positive order of the Court of\r\nDirectors, and was in the place where that inquiry could be made\r\neffectually, and in the place where the unfortunate women could have an\r\nopportunity of clearing themselves.\r\n\r\nI will first read to your Lordships an extract from the letter of the\r\nCourt of Directors to the board at Calcutta, dated the 14th of February,\r\n1783.\r\n\r\n     \"4. By the second article of the treaty [of Chunar] the Nabob is\r\n     permitted to resume such jaghires as he shall think proper, with a\r\n     reserve, that all such jaghiredars, for the amount of whose\r\n     jaghires the Company are guaranties, shall, in case of a resumption\r\n     of their lands, be paid the amount of the net collections through\r\n     the Resident.\r\n\r\n     \"5. We do not see how the Governor-General could consent to the\r\n     resumption of such lands as the Company had engaged should remain\r\n     in the hands of those who possessed them previous to the execution\r\n     of the late treaty, without stronger proofs of the Begums'\r\n     defection than have been laid before us; neither can we allow it to\r\n     be good policy to reduce the several jaghiredars, and thus uniting\r\n     the territory, and the troops maintained for the protection of that\r\n     territory, under one head, who, by that means, at some future\r\n     period, may become a very powerful enemy to the Company.\r\n\r\n     \"6. With respect to the resumption of the jaghires possessed by the\r\n     Begums in particular, and the subsequent seizure of the treasure\r\n     deposited with the Vizier's mother, which the Governor-General, in\r\n     his letter to the board, 23d January, 1782, has declared he\r\n     strenuously encouraged and supported, we hope and trust, for the\r\n     honor of the British nation, that the measure appeared to be fully\r\n     justified in the eyes of all Hindostan. The Governor-General has\r\n     informed us that it can be well attested, that the Begums\r\n     principally excited and supported the late commotions, and that\r\n     they carried their inveteracy to the English nation so far as to\r\n     aim at our utter extirpation.\r\n\r\n     \"7. It must have been publicly known that in 1775 the Resident at\r\n     the Vizier's court not only obtained from the Begum, widow of the\r\n     late Sujah Dowlah, on the Nabob's account, thirty lacs of rupees,\r\n     half of which was to be paid to the Company, but also the\r\n     forbearance of twenty-six lacs, for the repayment of which she had\r\n     security in land, on the Nabob's agreeing to renounce all further\r\n     claims upon her, and that to this agreement the Company were\r\n     guaranties.\r\n\r\n     \"8. We find that on the 21st December, 1775, the Begum complained\r\n     of a breach of engagements on the part of the Nabob, soliciting\r\n     your protection for herself, her mother, and for all the women\r\n     belonging to the seraglio of the late Nabob, from the distresses to\r\n     which they were reduced; in consequence whereof it was agreed in\r\n     consultation, 3d January, 1776, to remonstrate with the\r\n     Vizier,--the Governor-General remarking, that, as the\r\n     representative of our government has become an agent in this\r\n     business, and has pledged the honor and faith of the Company for\r\n     the punctual observance of the conditions under which the treaty\r\n     was concluded, you had a right to interfere, and justice demanded\r\n     it, if it should appear that those engagements have been violated.\r\n     And the board at the same time resolved, that, as soon as the\r\n     Begum's engagements with the Nabob, to which Mr. Bristow is a\r\n     party, shall be fulfilled on her part, this government will think\r\n     themselves bound to protect her against any further demand or\r\n     molestation.\r\n\r\n     \"9. If, therefore, the disaffection of the Begums was not a matter\r\n     of public notoriety, we cannot but be alarmed for the effects which\r\n     these subsequent transactions must have had on the minds of the\r\n     natives of India. The only consolation we feel upon this occasion\r\n     is, that the amount of those jaghires for which the Company were\r\n     guaranties is to be paid through our Resident at the court of the\r\n     Vizier; and it very materially concerns the credit of your\r\n     government on no account to suffer such payments to be evaded.\r\n\r\n     \"10. If it shall hereafter be found that the Begums did not take\r\n     that hostile part against the Company which has been represented,\r\n     as well in the Governor-General's Narrative as in several documents\r\n     therein referred to,--and as it nowhere appears, from the papers at\r\n     present in our possession, that they excited any commotion previous\r\n     to the imprisonment of Rajah Cheyt Sing, but only armed themselves\r\n     in consequence of that transaction,--and as it is probable that\r\n     such a conduct proceeded entirely from motives of self-defence,\r\n     under an apprehension that they themselves might likewise be laid\r\n     under unwarrantable contributions,--we direct that you use your\r\n     influence with the Vizier that their jaghires may be restored to\r\n     them; but if they should be under apprehensions respecting the\r\n     future conduct of the Vizier, and wish our further protection, it\r\n     is our pleasure that you afford those ladies an asylum within the\r\n     Company's territories, and there be paid the amount of the net\r\n     collections of their jaghires, agreeably to the second article of\r\n     the late treaty, through the medium of our Resident, as may be\r\n     ascertained upon an average estimate of some years back.\"\r\n\r\nYou see, my Lords, the Directors had received every one of his false\r\nimpressions. They had conceived an idea, that, after the rebellion of\r\nCheyt Sing, (but not before, upon his own showing,) the Begums had shown\r\na disposition to arm. They here assume a false fact, which Mr. Hastings\r\nstated in his representation of the business to them. They assume a\r\nvariety of other false facts: they assume that the amount of the\r\njaghires of the Begums were to be paid them in regular pensions; whereas\r\nthey were totally confiscated, without any compensation at all. And yet,\r\nupon Mr. Hastings's own showing, they found the transaction to be so\r\ndishonorable to the British government, that they desire him to make\r\ninquiry into it, and give redress accordingly.\r\n\r\nHere, then, is another order of the Company, another call upon Mr.\r\nHastings to examine to the bottom of this affair. The Directors, after\r\ngiving him credit for that enormous mass of falsehoods which we have\r\nproved him to have stated in his Narrative, found themselves so utterly\r\ndissatisfied, that they gave this conditional order to restore the\r\nBegums to their jaghires. Your Lordships will find it in evidence upon\r\nyour minutes, that he contumaciously disobeyed this order,--that he\r\nwould not consent to the propositions of the Council for inquiring into\r\nthe conduct of these injured women, but stifled every attempt that was\r\nmade by others to do them justice. And yet he here has the effrontery to\r\npropose that your Lordships should inquire into the business at your\r\nbar,--that you should investigate a matter here which he refused to\r\ninquire into on the spot, though expressly ordered by his masters so to\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nI will now read to your Lordships a short extract from his own narrative\r\nof his own proceedings. It begins with reciting part of a note entered\r\nby Mr. Macpherson in the Consultations of the Council, at the time when\r\nthe orders of the Court of Directors which I have just alluded to were\r\ntaken into consideration.\r\n\r\n\"What the Court of Directors seem to have most at heart are, first, that\r\nthe engagement of the second article of the Benares treaty should be\r\nfaithfully fulfilled,--and, secondly, to guard against the future\r\nmisconduct of the Vizier, if he should be disposed to oppress the\r\nBegums; that we should therefore ascertain whether the amount of the\r\njaghires of the Begums is regularly paid to them through the Company's\r\nResident, and give them notice that no future demands shall be made upon\r\nthem. This the Governor-General might, I think, do in a letter that\r\nwould make the Begums sensible of their past misconduct, yet inform them\r\nof the lenity and gracious intentions of the Company, in ordering them\r\nan asylum in Bengal, in case of future distress.\"\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the foregoing opinion from Mr. Macpherson, the\r\nfollowing minute was delivered by the Governor-General.\r\n\r\n\"I should gladly acquiesce in the motion made by Mr. Macpherson, if I\r\nthought it possible to frame a letter to the Begums in any terms which\r\nshould at the same time convey the intimation proposed by it and not\r\ndefeat the purpose of it, or be productive of evils greater than any\r\nwhich exist in consequence of the proceedings which have already taken\r\nplace, and which time has almost obliterated. The orders of the Court of\r\nDirectors are conditional; they require nothing, but in the event of\r\ndiscoveries made subsequent to the advices which were before you on the\r\n14th February last, in alleviation of the former conduct of the Begums.\r\nNothing has since appeared in relation to them, but their refusal, or\r\nrather that of one, to fulfil her engagements for the payment of the\r\nremainder of the sum exacted from her by the Nabob Vizier in the\r\nbeginning of last year. Whatever obedience may be due to the clear\r\nascertained spirit of the orders of the Court of Directors, this\r\nobligation cannot extend to points to which neither the letter nor\r\nevident spirit of their orders apply. If I am rightly informed, the\r\nNabob Vizier and the Begums are on terms of mutual good-will. It would\r\nill become this government to interpose its influence by any act which\r\nmight tend to revive their animosities: and a very slight occasion would\r\nbe sufficient to effect it. It will be to little purpose to tell them\r\nthat their conduct has, in our estimation of it, been very wrong, and at\r\nthe same time to announce to them the orders of our superiors, which\r\nmore than indicate the reverse. They will instantly take fire on such a\r\ndeclaration, proclaim the judgment of the Company in their favor, demand\r\na reparation of the acts which they will construe wrongs with such a\r\nsentence warranting that construction,--and either accept the\r\ninvitation, to the proclaimed scandal of the Vizier, which will not add\r\nto the credit of our government, or remain in his dominions, but not\r\nunder his authority, to add to his vexations and the disorders of the\r\ncountry, by continual intrigues and seditions. Enough already exists to\r\naffect his peace, and the quiet of his people; if we cannot heal, let us\r\nnot inflame the wounds which have been inflicted.\r\n\r\n\"If the Begums think themselves aggrieved to such a degree as to justify\r\nthem in an appeal to a foreign jurisdiction,--to appeal to it against a\r\nman standing in the relation of son and grandson to them,--to appeal to\r\nthe justice of those who have been the abettors and instruments of their\r\nimputed wrongs,--let us at least permit them to be the judges of their\r\nown feelings, and prefer their complaints before we offer to redress\r\nthem: they will not need to be prompted. I hope I shall not depart from\r\nthe simplicity of official language, in saying, that the majesty of\r\njustice ought to be approached with solicitation, not descend to provoke\r\nor invite it, much less to debase itself by the suggestion of wrongs and\r\nthe promise of redress, with the denunciation of punishment before\r\ntrial, and even before accusation.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, if, since the beginning of the world, such a paper as this was\r\never before written by a person standing in the relation of a servant to\r\nhis master, I shall allow that every word we have said to your Lordships\r\nupon this occasion to mark his guilt ought to be expunged from your\r\nminutes and from our charges.\r\n\r\nBefore I proceed to make any observations upon this act of open\r\nrebellion against his superiors, I must beg your Lordships to remark the\r\ncruelty of purpose, the hostile feeling, towards these injured women,\r\nwhich were displayed in this daring defiance. Your Lordships will find\r\nthat he never is a rebel to one party without being a tyrant to some\r\nothers; that _rebel_ and _tyrant_ are correlative terms, when applied to\r\nhim, and that they constantly go together.\r\n\r\nIt is suggested by the Directors, that the Nabob is the persecutor, the\r\noppressor, and that Mr. Hastings is the person who is to redress the\r\nwrong. But here they have mistaken the matter totally. For we have\r\nproved to your Lordships that Mr. Hastings was the principal in the\r\npersecution, and that the Nabob was only an instrument. \"If I am rightly\r\ninformed,\" he says, \"the Nabob and the Begums are on terms of mutual\r\ngood-will. It would ill become this government to interpose its\r\ninfluence by any act which might tend to revive their animosities: and a\r\nvery slight occasion would be sufficient to effect it.\" What animosities\r\nhad they towards each other? None that we know of. Mr. Hastings gets the\r\nNabob to rob his mother; and then he supposes, contrary to truth,\r\ncontrary to fact, contrary to everything your Lordships have heard, that\r\nthe Nabob would fall into a fury, if his mother was to obtain any\r\nredress,--and that, if the least inquiry into this business was made, it\r\nwould create a flame in the Nabob's mind, on account of the active,\r\nenergetic, spirited part he had taken in these transactions.\r\n\"Therefore,\" says he, \"oh, for God's sake, soothe the matter! It is a\r\ngreen wound; don't uncover it; do nothing to irritate. It will be to\r\nlittle purpose to tell them that their conduct has in our estimation of\r\nit been very wrong, and at the same time announce to them the orders of\r\nour superiors, which more than indicate the reverse.\" Now, my Lords, to\r\nwhat does all this amount? \"First,\" says he, \"I will not do them\r\njustice,--I will not enter upon an inquiry into their wrongs.\" Why?\r\n\"Because they charge us with having inflicted them.\" Then, surely, for\r\nthat reason, you ought to commence an inquiry. \"No,\" says he, \"that\r\nwould be telling them that our superiors suspect we are in the wrong.\"\r\nBut when his superiors more than indicated suspicions, was he not bound\r\ntenfold to make that inquiry, for his honor and for their satisfaction,\r\nwhich they direct him to make? No, he will not do it, \"because,\" says\r\nhe, \"the Begums would either accept the offer of an asylum in the\r\nCompany's territories, to the proclaimed scandal of the Vizier, which\r\nwould not add to the credit of our government, or they would remain in\r\nhis dominions, but not under his authority, to add to his vexations, and\r\nthe disorders of the country, by continual intrigues and seditions.\"\r\n\r\nYou see, my Lords, this man is constantly thrusting this peaceable Nabob\r\nbefore him; goading and pushing him on, as if with a bayonet behind, to\r\nthe commission of everything that is base and dishonorable. You have him\r\nhere declaring that he will not satisfy the Directors, his masters, in\r\ntheir inquiries about those acts, for fear of the Nabob's taking\r\numbrage, and getting into a flame with his mother,--and for fear the\r\nmother, supported by the opinion of the Directors, should be induced to\r\nresent her wrongs. What, I say, does all this amount to? It amounts to\r\nthis:--\"The Begums accuse me of doing them injustice; the Directors\r\nindicate a suspicion that they have been injured; therefore I will not\r\ninquire into the matter.\" Why? \"Because it may raise disturbances.\" But\r\nwhat disturbance could it raise? The mother is disarmed, and could not\r\nhurt the Nabob. All her landed estates he knew were confiscated; he knew\r\nall her money was in his own possession; he knew she had not the means,\r\nif she had been disposed, to create intrigues and cabals;--what\r\ndisturbance, then, could be created by his sending a letter to know what\r\nshe had to say upon the subject of her wrongs?\r\n\r\n\"_If_\" says he, \"_the Begums think themselves aggrieved._\" Observe, my\r\nLords, that the institution of an inquiry is no measure of the Begums;\r\nit is an order of the Court of Directors, made by them upon his own\r\nrepresentation of his own case, and upon nothing else. The Begums did\r\nnot dare to murmur; they did not dare to ask for redress, God knows the\r\npoor creatures were, at or about the time, his\r\nprisoners,--robbed,--stripped of everything,--without hope and without\r\nresource. But the Directors, doing their duty upon that occasion, did\r\ncondemn him upon his own false representations contained in that bundle\r\nof affidavits upon which his counsel now contend that your Lordships\r\nshould acquit him.--\"But,\" says he, \"are they to _appeal to a foreign\r\njurisdiction_?\" When these women were to be robbed, we were not\r\nforeigners to them; on the contrary, we adjudged them guilty of\r\nrebellion. We sent an English chief-justice to collect materials of\r\naccusation against them. We sent English officers to take their money.\r\nThe whole was an English transaction. When wrong is to be done, we have\r\nthen an interest in the country to justify our acting in it; but when\r\nthe question is of redressing wrongs, when the question is of doing\r\njustice, when the question is of inquiry, when the question is of\r\nhearing complaints, then it is a foreign jurisdiction. You are to suffer\r\nMr. Hastings--to make it foreign, or to make it domestic, just as it\r\nanswers his purposes.--But they are \"_to appeal against a man standing\r\nin the relation of son and grandson to them, and to appeal to the\r\njustice of those who have been the abettors and instruments of their\r\nimputed wrongs_.\" Why, my Lords, if he allows that he is the abettor of,\r\nand the instrument to which the Directors impute these wrongs, why, I\r\nask, does he, with those charges lying upon him, object to all inquiry\r\nin the manner you have seen?\r\n\r\nBut the Company's Governor is, it seems, all at once transformed into a\r\ngreat sovereign;--\"_the majesty of justice ought to be approached with\r\nsolicitation_.\" Here, my Lords, he forgets at once the Court of\r\nDirectors, he forgets the laws of England, he forgets the act of\r\nParliament, he forgets that any obedience is due to his superiors. The\r\nBegums were to approach him by the orders of the Court of Directors; he\r\nsets at nought these orders, and asserts that he must be approached with\r\nsolicitations.\r\n\r\n\"_Time_,\" says he, \"_has obliterated their sufferings._\" Oh, what a balm\r\nof oblivion time spreads over the wrongs, wounds, and afflictions of\r\nothers, in the mind of the person who inflicts those wrongs and\r\noppressions! The oppressor soon forgets. This robbery took place in\r\n17[81]; it was in the year 1783 when he asserted that the waters of\r\nLethe had been poured over all their wrongs and oppressions. Your\r\nLordships will mark this insulting language, when he says that both the\r\norder of the Directors and the application of the Begums for redress\r\nmust be _solicitations to him_.\r\n\r\n     [Here Mr. Burke was interrupted by Mr. Hastings, who said, \"My\r\n     Lords, there was no order. I find a man's patience may be\r\n     exhausted. I hear so many falsehoods, that I must declare there was\r\n     no order of the Court of Directors. Forgive me, my Lords. He may\r\n     say what he pleases; I will not again controvert it. But there is\r\n     no order; if there is, read it.\" Mr. Burke then proceeded.]\r\n\r\nJudge you, my Lords, what the insolence, audacity, and cruelty of this\r\nman must have been, from his want of patience in his present situation,\r\nand when he dares to hold this language here. Your Lordships will reckon\r\nwith him for it, or the world will reckon with you.\r\n\r\n     [Mr. Hastings here again interrupted Mr. Burke, and said, \"There\r\n     was no order for inquiry.\"]\r\n\r\n_Mr. Burke._--Your Lordships have heard the letter read,--I mean the\r\nletter from the Directors, which I read just now. You will judge whether\r\nit is an order or not. I did hope within these two days to put an end to\r\nthis business; but when your Lordships hear us charged with direct\r\nfalsehood at your bar, when you hear this wicked wretch who is before\r\nyou--\r\n\r\n     [_From a Lord._--Order! order! order!]\r\n\r\n_Mr. Burke._--Order, my Lords, we call for, in the name of the Commons!\r\nYour Lordships have heard us accused at your bar of falsehood, after we\r\nhad read the order upon which our assertion was founded. This man, whom\r\nwe have described as the scourge and terror of India, this man gets up,\r\nand charges us, not with a mistake, an error, a wrong construction, but\r\na direct falsehood,--and adds, that his patience is worn out with the\r\nfalsehood he hears. This is not an English court of justice, if such a\r\nthing is permitted. We beg leave to retire, and take instructions from\r\nour constituents. He ought to be sent to Bridewell for going on in this\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n     [_Mr. Wyndham here read the letter again._]\r\n\r\n_Mr. Burke._--With regard to the ravings of this unhappy man, I am sure,\r\nif I were only considering what passed from him to the Managers in this\r\nbox, and knowing what allowance is due to a wounded conscience, brought\r\nbefore an awful tribunal, and smarting under the impressions of its own\r\nguilt, I would pass them over. But, my Lords, we have the honor of the\r\nCommons, we have the honor of this court to sustain. [Your Lordships,\r\nthe other day, for an offence committed against a constable, who was\r\nkeeping the way under your orders, did, very justly, and to the great\r\nsatisfaction of the public, commit the party to Bridewell, for a much\r\nslighter insult against the honor and dignify of your court.] And I\r\nleave it, therefore, for the present, till your Lordships can seriously\r\nconsider what the mode of proceeding in this matter ought to be.--I now\r\nproceed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have read to your Lordships the orders of the Court of Directors: I\r\nagain say we consider them as orders: your Lordships are as good judges\r\nof the propriety of the term as we are. You have heard them read; you\r\nhave also heard that the Council at Calcutta considered them as orders,\r\nfor resolutions were moved upon them; and Mr. Stables, in evidence\r\nbefore you here, who was one of the Council, so considered them: and yet\r\nthis man has the frantic audacity in this place to assert that they were\r\nnot orders, and to declare that he cannot stand the repetition of such\r\nabominable falsehoods as are perpetually urged against him. We cannot\r\nconceive that your Lordships will suffer this; and if you do, I promise\r\nyou the Commons will not suffer the justice of the country to be trifled\r\nwith and insulted in this manner: because, if such conduct be suffered\r\nby your Lordships, they must say that very disagreeable consequences\r\nwill ensue, and very disagreeable inferences will be drawn by the public\r\nconcerning it. You will forgive, and we know how to forgive, the ravings\r\nof people smarting under a conscious sense of their guilt. But when we\r\nare reading documents given in evidence, and are commenting upon them,\r\nthe use of this kind of language really deserves your Lordships'\r\nconsideration. As for us, we regard it no more than we should other\r\nnoise and brawlings of criminals who in irons may be led through the\r\nstreets, raving at the magistrate that has committed them. We consider\r\nhim as a poor, miserable man, railing at his accusers: it is natural he\r\nshould fall into all these frantic ravings, but it is not fit or natural\r\nthat the Court should indulge him in them. Your Lordships shall now hear\r\nin what sense Mr. Wheler and Mr. Stables, two other members of the\r\nCouncil, understood this letter.\r\n\r\nMr. Wheler thus writes.--\"It always has been and always will be my wish\r\nto conform implicitly to the orders of the Court of Directors, and I\r\ntrust that the opinion which I shall give upon that part of the Court's\r\nletter which is now before us will not be taken up against its meaning,\r\nas going to a breach of them. The orders at present under the board's\r\nconsideration are entirely provisional. Nothing has passed since the\r\nconclusion of the agreement made by the Governor-General with the Vizier\r\nat Chunar which induces me to alter the opinion which I before held, as\r\nwell from the Governor-General's reports to this board as the opinions\r\nwhich I have heard of many individuals totally unconcerned in the\r\nsubject, that the Begums at Fyzabad did take a hostile part against the\r\nCompany during the disturbances in Benares; and I am impressed with a\r\nconviction that the conduct of the Begums did not proceed entirely from\r\nmotives of self-defence. But as the Court of Directors appear to be of a\r\ndifferent opinion, and conceive that there ought to be stronger proofs\r\nof the defection of the Begums than have been laid before them, I think,\r\nthat, before we decide on their orders, the late and present Resident at\r\nthe Vizier's court, and the commanding officers in the Vizier's country,\r\nought to be required to collect and lay before the board all the\r\ninformation they can obtain with respect to the defection of the Begums\r\nduring the troubles in Benares, and their present disposition to the\r\nCompany.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Stables, September 9th, 1783, writes thus.--\"The Court of Directors,\r\nby their letter of the 14th February, 1783, seem not to be satisfied\r\nthat the disaffection of the Begums to this government is sufficiently\r\nproved by the evidence before them. I therefore think that the late and\r\npresent Resident and commanding officers in the Vizier's country at the\r\ntime should be called upon to collect what further information they can\r\non this subject, in which the honor and dignity of this government is so\r\nmaterially concerned, that such information may be immediately\r\ntransmitted to the Court of Directors.\"\r\n\r\nWhen questioned upon this subject at your Lordships' bar, he gives this\r\nevidence.--\"_Q._ What was your motive for proposing that\r\ninvestigation?--_A._ A letter from the Court of Directors; I conceived\r\nit to be ordered by them.--_Q._ Did you conceive the letter of the Court\r\nof Directors positively to direct that inquiry?--_A._ I did so certainly\r\nat the time, and I beg to refer to the minutes which expressed it.\"--A\r\nquestion was put to the same witness by a noble lord. \"_Q._ The witness\r\nhas stated, that at the time he has mentioned he conceived the letter\r\nfrom the Court of Directors to order an inquiry, and that it was upon\r\nthat opinion that he regulated his conduct, and his proposal for such\r\ninquiry. I wish to know whether the expression, '_at the time_,' was\r\nmerely casual, or am I to understand from it that the witness has\r\naltered his opinion of the intention of this letter since that\r\ntime?--_A._ I certainly retain that opinion, and I wished the inquiry to\r\ngo on.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, you see that his colleagues so understood it; you see that we\r\nso understood it; and still you have heard the prisoner, after charging\r\nus with falsehood, insultingly tell us we may go on as we please, we may\r\ngo on in our own way. If your Lordships think that it was not a positive\r\norder, which Mr. Hastings was bound to obey, you will acquit him of the\r\nbreach of it. But it is a most singular thing, among all the astonishing\r\ncircumstances of this case, that this man, who has heard from the\r\nbeginning to the end of his trial breaches of the Company's orders\r\nconstantly charged upon him,--(nay, I will venture to say, that there is\r\nnot a single step that we have taken in this prosecution, or in\r\nobservations upon evidence, in which we have not charged him with an\r\navowed direct breach of the Company's order,--you have heard it ten\r\ntimes this day,--in his defence before the Commons he declares he did\r\nintentionally, in naming Mr. Markham, break the Company's orders,)--it\r\nis singular, I say, that this man should now pretend to be so sore upon\r\nthis point. What is it now that makes him break through all the rules of\r\ncommon decency and common propriety, and show all the burnings of guilt,\r\nupon being accused of the breach of one of the innumerable orders which\r\nhe has broken, of which he has avowed the breaking, and attempted to\r\njustify himself a thousand times in the Company's books for having\r\nbroken?\r\n\r\nMy Lords, one of his own body, one of the Council, has sworn at your bar\r\nwhat he repeatedly declared to be his sense of it. We consider it as one\r\nof the strongest orders that can be given, because the reason of the\r\norder is added to it: the Directors declaring, that, if it should not be\r\nfound upon inquiry, (you see, my Lords, it puts the very case,)--\"if you\r\ndo not find such and such things, we shall consider the English honor\r\nwounded and stained, and we direct you to make reparation.\" There are,\r\nin fact, two orders contained in this letter, which we take to be\r\nequally strong and positive,--and we charge him with the breach of both:\r\nnamely, the order for inquiry, and the conditional order of restoring to\r\nthe Begums their jaghires, or making satisfaction for them; and in case\r\nof any apprehension of reluctance in the Nabob, to bring them for\r\nsecurity into the Company's territories. The two last positive orders\r\nare preceded by the supposition of an inquiry which was to justify him\r\neither in the acts he had done or to justify him in making restitution.\r\nHe did neither the one nor the other. We aver that he disobeyed all\r\nthese orders. And now let his impatience break out again.\r\n\r\nYour Lordships have seen, amongst the various pretences by which this\r\nman has endeavored to justify his various delinquencies, that of fearing\r\nto offend the Nabob by the restoration of their jaghires to the Begums\r\nis one. Your Lordships will form your own judgment of the truth or\r\nfalsehood of this pretence, when you shall have heard the letter which I\r\nshall now read to you, written to Mr. Hastings by the Nabob himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Letter from the Nabob Vizier to Mr. Hastings, 25th February,\r\n     1782._\r\n\r\n     \"You performed on every occasion towards me whatever was becoming\r\n     of friendship: I, too, have done whatever affection required and\r\n     you commanded; and in future also, whatever may be your pleasure,\r\n     there shall be no deviation therefrom, because whatever you direct\r\n     is altogether for my benefit. The business for which I came to\r\n     Fyzabad is become settled by your favor: particulars will become\r\n     known to your wisdom from the writings of Mr. Middleton. I am\r\n     grateful for your favors. If in these matters you sincerely approve\r\n     me, communicate it, for it will be a comfort to me. Having\r\n     appointed my own aumils to the jaghire of the lady mother, I have\r\n     engaged to pay her cash. She has complied with my views. Her\r\n     pleasure is, that, after receiving an engagement, he should deliver\r\n     up the jaghires. What is your pleasure in this matter? If you\r\n     command, it will comfort the lady mother giving her back the\r\n     jaghire after I have obtained my views; or I will have it under my\r\n     aumil. I am obedient to your pleasure.\"\r\n\r\nYour Lordships here see the Begum a suppliant to have her jaghire\r\nrestored, (after entering into some engagement that might have been\r\nrequired of her,) and the Nabob, in a tone equally suppliant, expressing\r\nhis consent, at least, that her request should be complied with, if the\r\ncommand of Mr. Hastings could be procured.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy Lords, in order to save your Lordships' time, and that I might not\r\noverload this business, I did not intend to have troubled you with any\r\nobservations upon this part of it; but the charge of falsehood which the\r\nprisoner at your bar has had the audacity to bring against us has\r\ninduced me to lay it more particularly before, you. We have now done\r\nwith it; but before we retire, your Lordships will permit me to\r\nrecapitulate briefly the substance of what has now been urged respecting\r\nhis conduct towards these miserable women. We accuse him of reiterated\r\nbreaches of the orders of the Court of Directors, both in the letter and\r\nspirit of them, and of his contempt of the opinions which his colleagues\r\nin office had formed of them. We charge him with the aggravation of\r\nthese delinquencies, by the oppression and ruin which they brought upon\r\nthe family of the Nabob, by the infraction of treaties, and by the\r\ndisrepute which in his person was sustained by the government he\r\nrepresented, and by the stain left upon the justice, honor, and good\r\nfaith of the English nation. We charge him with their farther\r\naggravation by sundry false pretences alleged by him in justification of\r\nthis conduct, the pretended reluctance of the Nabob, the fear of\r\noffending him, the suggestion of the Begums having forgotten and\r\nforgiven the wrongs they had suffered, and of the danger of reviving\r\ntheir discontent by any attempt to redress them, and by his insolent\r\nlanguage, that the majesty of justice with which he impudently invests\r\nhimself was only to be approached with solicitation. We have farther\r\nstated, that the pretence that he was only concerned in this business as\r\nan accessary is equally false; it being, on the contrary, notorious,\r\nthat the Nabob was the accessary, forced into the service, and a mere\r\ninstrument in his hands, and that he and Sir Elijah Impey (whose\r\nemployment in this business we stated as a farther aggravation) were the\r\nauthors and principal agents. And we farther contend, that each of these\r\naggravations and pretences is itself, in fact and in its principle, a\r\nsubstantive crime.\r\n\r\nYour Lordships witnessed the insolence with which this man, stung to the\r\nquick by the recital of his crime, interrupted me; and you heard his\r\nrecrimination of falsehood against us. We again avouch the truth of all\r\nand every word we have uttered, and the validity of every proof with\r\nwhich we have supported them. Let his impatience, I say, now again burst\r\nforth,--he who feels so sensibly everything that touches him, and yet\r\nseeks for an act of indemnity for his own atrocities, by endeavoring to\r\nmake you believe that the wrongs of a desolated family are within one\r\nyear forgotten by them, and buried in oblivion.\r\n\r\nI trust, my Lords, that both his prosecutors and his judges will evince\r\nthat patience which the criminal wants. Justice is not to wait to have\r\nits majesty approached with solicitation. We see that throne in which\r\nresides invisibly, but virtually, the majesty of England; we see your\r\nLordships representing, in succession, the juridical authority in the\r\nhighest court in this kingdom: but we do not approach you with\r\nsolicitation; we make it a petition of right; we claim it; we demand it.\r\nThe right of seeking redress is not suppliant, even before the majesty\r\nof England; it comes boldly forward, and never thinks it offends its\r\nsovereign by claiming what is the right of all his people.\r\n\r\nWe have now done with this business: a business as atrocious as any that\r\nis known in the history of mankind; a business that has stained,\r\nthroughout all Asia, the British character, and by which our fame for\r\nhonor, integrity, and public faith has been forfeited; a business which\r\nhas introduced us throughout that country as breakers of faith,\r\ndestroyers of treaties, plunderers of the weak and unprotected, and has\r\ndishonored and will forever dishonor the British name. Your Lordships\r\nhave had all this in evidence. You have seen in what manner the Nabob,\r\nhis country, his revenues, his subjects, his mother, his family, his\r\nnobility, and all their fortunes, real and personal, have been disposed\r\nof by the prisoner at your bar; and having seen this, you will by the\r\nimpatience of this criminal estimate the patience of the unfortunate\r\nwomen into whose injuries he refused to inquire. What he would not do\r\nthe Commons have done. They know that you have a feeling different from\r\nthat which he manifested on this occasion; they do not approach you\r\nsuppliantly, but demand justice; they insist, that, as the Commons have\r\ndone their part, your Lordships will perform yours.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe shall next proceed to show your Lordships how he acted towards\r\nanother set of women, the women of the late Sujah Dowlah, and for whom\r\nthe Directors had ordered a maintenance to be secured by an express\r\ntreaty. You will see that he is cruel towards the weak sex, and to all\r\nothers in proportion as they are weak and powerless to resist him. You\r\nwill see, I say, when he had usurped the whole government of Oude, and\r\nbrought it into a servile dependence on himself, how these women fared;\r\nand then your Lordships will judge whether or not, and in what degree,\r\nhe is criminal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH\r\n\r\nIN\r\n\r\nGENERAL REPLY.\r\n\r\nSEVENTH DAY. THURSDAY, JUNE 12, 1794.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Lords,--When I had last the honor of addressing your Lordships from\r\nthis place, my observations were principally directed to the unjust\r\nconfiscation and seizure of the jaghires and treasures of the Begums,\r\nwithout previous accusation, or trial, or subsequent inquiry into their\r\nconduct, in violation of a treaty made with them and guarantied by the\r\nEast India Company,--to the long imprisonment and cruel treatment of\r\ntheir ministers, and to the false pretences and abominable principles by\r\nwhich the prisoner at your bar has attempted to justify his conduct. The\r\nseveral acts of violence and of oppression were, as we have shown your\r\nLordships, committed with circumstances of aggravated atrocity highly\r\ndisgraceful to the British name and character,--and particularly by his\r\nforcing the Nabob to become the means and instrument of reducing his\r\nmother and grandmother and their families to absolute want and distress.\r\n\r\nI have now to call your attention to his treatment of another branch of\r\nthis miserable family,--the women and children of the late Nabob Sujah\r\nul Dowlah. These persons were dependent upon the Begums, and by the\r\nconfiscation of their property, and by the ruin of various persons who\r\nwould otherwise have contributed to their maintenance, were reduced to\r\nthe last extremity of indigence and want. Being left without the common\r\nnecessaries of life, they were driven to the necessity of breaking\r\nthrough all those local principles of decorum which constitute the\r\ncharacter of the female sex in that part of the world; and after\r\nfruitless supplications and shrieks of famine, they endeavored to break\r\nthe inclosure of the palace, and to force their way to the market-place,\r\nin order to beg for bread. When they had thus been forced to submit to\r\nthe extremity of disgrace and degradation, by exposing themselves to\r\npublic view with the starving children of their late sovereign, the\r\nbrothers and sisters of the reigning prince, they were, in this attempt,\r\nattacked by the sepoys armed with bludgeons, and driven back by blows\r\ninto the palace.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, we have first laid before you the sufferings and disgraces of\r\nwomen of the first distinction in Asia, protected by their rank,\r\nprotected by their sex, protected by their near relation to the prince\r\nof the country, protected by two guaranties of the representative of the\r\nBritish government in India. We now come to another class of women, who\r\nsuffered by the violent misappropriation of the revenues of the Nabob,\r\nby which their regular allowance was taken from them; and your Lordships\r\nwill find that this man's crimes, at every step we take, ripen in guilt,\r\nhis acts of positive injustice are always aggravated by his conduct with\r\nregard to the consequences of them, and form but a small part in the\r\nmass of oppression and tyranny which we have brought before you.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, the unjust seizure of the jaghires and treasures of the\r\nBegums, out of which those women were maintained, reduced them to a\r\nstate of indigence, and exposed them not only to the sufferings which\r\nbelong to the physical nature of man, but also to the indignities which\r\nparticularly affected their sex and condition. But before I proceed, I\r\nwill beg leave to restate to your Lordships and recall to your memory\r\nwho these women were.\r\n\r\nThe Nabob Sujah Dowlah had but one legitimate wife. Though the Mahometan\r\nlaw admits of this number's being extended in certain cases even to\r\nfour, yet it is for the most part held disreputable, especially when a\r\nperson is married to a woman of the first distinction, to have more than\r\none legitimate wife. Upon looking into the Hedaya, your Lordships will\r\nsee with what extreme rigor fornication is forbidden; but we know that\r\npersons of high rank, by customs that supersede both religion and laws,\r\nadd to the number of their wives, or substitute in their room wives of a\r\nsubordinate description, and indulge themselves in this license to an\r\nunlimited degree. You will find in Chardin's Travels, where he treats of\r\nthe subject of marriage, that such is the custom of all the princes of\r\nthe East. The wives of this subordinate class, though they are in\r\nreality no better than concubines, and are subject to the power and\r\ncaprices of their lords, are yet allowed, in the eye of the severest\r\nmoralists, to have some excuse for their frailty and their weakness; and\r\nthey accordingly always do find a degree of favor in this world, and\r\nbecome the object of particular protection.\r\n\r\nWe know that Sujah ul Dowlah was a man unquestionably in his manners\r\nvery licentious with regard to women, that he had a great number of\r\nthese women in his family, and that his women and the women attendant\r\nupon the persons of his favorites had increased to a very great number.\r\nWe know that his sons amounted to twenty,--or, according to Mr.\r\nHastings's own account, to nineteen. Montesquieu supposes that there are\r\nmore females born in the East than in the West. But he says this upon no\r\ngood ground. We know by better and more regular information concerning\r\nthis matter, that the birth of males and females in that country is in\r\nthe same proportion as it is here; and therefore, if you suppose that he\r\nhad twenty sons, you may suppose he had about nineteen daughters. By the\r\ncustoms of that country, all these sons and daughters were considered as\r\npersons of eminent distinction, though inferior to the legitimate\r\nchildren,--assuming the rank of their father, without considering the\r\nrank which their mother held. All these wives with their children, and\r\nall their female servants and attendants, amounting in the whole to\r\nabout eight hundred persons, were shut up in what they call the _Khord\r\nMohul_, or Lesser Palace. This place is described by one of the\r\nwitnesses to be about as large as St. James's Square. Your Lordships\r\nhave been told, that, in other circumstances as well as this, these\r\nwomen were considered as objects of a great degree of respect, and of\r\nthe greatest degree of protection. I refer your Lordships to the treaty\r\nby which their maintenance was guarantied by the English government.\r\n\r\nIn order to let your Lordships see that I state nothing to you but what\r\nis supported not only by general history, which is enough to support an\r\naccount of general manners, but by the particular and peculiar opinions\r\nof a person best informed of the nature of the case, I will refer you to\r\nthe Nabob himself: for, undoubtedly, the Nabob of Oude, the Vizier of\r\nthe Empire, the Subahdar of the country, was most likely to be the best\r\njudge of what respect was due to the women of his father's family. I\r\nwill therefore read to your Lordships, from his own letters, what the\r\nNabob's opinion was upon this subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Extract of a Letter from the Vizier, received 23d of August,\r\n     1782._\r\n\r\n     \"I never found resource equal to the necessary expenses. Every\r\n     year, by taking from the ministers, and selling the articles of my\r\n     harkhanna, I with great distress transacted the business. But I\r\n     could not take care of my dependants: so that some of my brothers,\r\n     from their difficulties, arose and departed; and the people of the\r\n     Khord Mohul of the late Nabob, who are all my mothers, from their\r\n     distresses are reduced to poverty and involved in difficulties. No\r\n     man of rank is deficient in the care of his dependants, in\r\n     proportion to his ability.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Another Letter from the Vizier, received the 31st July, 1784._\r\n\r\n     \"My brother, dear as life, Saadut Ali Khân, has requested that I\r\n     would permit his mother to go and reside with him. My friend, all\r\n     the mothers of my brothers, and the women of the late Nabob, whom I\r\n     respect as my own mothers, are here, and it is incumbent upon me to\r\n     support them: accordingly I do it; and it is improper that they\r\n     should be separated, nor do I approve it. By God's blessing and\r\n     your kindness, I hope that all the women of the late Nabob may\r\n     remain here; it is the wish also of my grandmother and my mother\r\n     that they should.\"\r\n\r\nYour Lordships now see in what degree of estimation the Nabob held these\r\nwomen. He regarded the wives of his father as his honorary mothers; he\r\nconsiders their children as his brethren; he thinks it would be highly\r\ndishonorable to his government, if one of them was taken out of the\r\nsanctuary in which they are placed, and in which, he says, the great of\r\nthe country are obliged to maintain their dependants. This is the\r\naccount given by the person best acquainted with the usages of the\r\ncountry, best acquainted with his own duties, best acquainted with his\r\nown wishes.\r\n\r\nNow, my Lords, you will see in what light another person, the agent of a\r\ntrading company, who designates himself under the name of Majesty, and\r\nassumes other great distinctions, presumes also to consider these\r\npersons,--and in what contempt he is pleased to hold what is respected\r\nand what is held sacred in that country. What I am now going to quote is\r\nfrom the prisoner's second defence. For I must remind your Lordships\r\nthat Mr. Hastings has made three defences,--one in the House of Commons,\r\nanother in the lobby of the House of Commons, and a third at your\r\nLordships' bar. The second defence, though delivered without name, to\r\nthe members in the lobby of the House of Commons, has been proved at\r\nyour Lordships' bar to be written by himself. This lobby, this\r\nout-of-door defence, militates in some respects, as your Lordships will\r\nfind, with the in-door defence; but it probably contains the real\r\nsentiments of Mr. Hastings himself, delivered with a little more\r\nfreeness when he gets into the open air,--like the man who was so vain\r\nof some silly plot he had hatched, that he told it to the\r\nhackney-coachman, and every man he met in the streets.\r\n\r\nHe says,--\"Begums are the ladies of an Eastern prince; but these women\r\nare also styled the ladies of the late Vizier, and their sufferings are\r\npainted in such strong colors that the unsuspecting reader is led to mix\r\nthe subjects together, and to suppose that these latter, too, were\r\nprincesses of Oude, that all their sufferings proceeded from some act of\r\nmine, or had the sanction of my authority or permission. The fact is,\r\nthat the persons of the Khord Mohul (or Little Seraglio) were young\r\ncreatures picked up wherever youth and beauty could be found, and mostly\r\npurchased from amongst the most necessitous and meanest ranks of the\r\npeople, for the Nabob's pleasures.\" In the in-door defence, he says,\r\n\"The said women, who were mostly persons of low condition, and the said\r\nchildren, if any such there were, lived in the Khord Mohul, on an\r\nestablishment entirely distinct from the said Begums'.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, you have seen what was the opinion of the Nabob, who ought to\r\nknow the nature and circumstances of his father's palace, respecting\r\nthese women; you hear what Mr. Hastings's opinion is: and now the\r\nquestion is, whether your Lordships will consider these women in the\r\nsame light in which the person does who is most nearly connected with\r\nthem and most likely to know them, or in the way in which Mr. Hastings\r\nhas thought proper, within doors and without doors, to describe them.\r\nYour Lordships will be pleased to observe that he has brought no proof\r\nwhatever of facts which are so boldly asserted by him in defiance of\r\nproof to the contrary, totally at variance with the letter of the son of\r\nthe man to whom these women belonged. Your Lordships, I say, will remark\r\nthat he has produced not one word of evidence, either within the House\r\nof Commons or the House of Peers, or in the lobby, or anywhere else, to\r\nverify any one word he has said. He slanders these women in order to\r\nlessen that compassion which your Lordships might have for the\r\nsufferings he inflicted upon them. But admitting that some of these\r\nwomen were of a meaner condition, and that they derived nothing from\r\ntheir connection with the dignity of the person by whom they had\r\nchildren, (and we know that in the whole they amounted to about\r\nfourscore children, the Nabob having a race like the patriarchs of old,\r\nas many great persons in that part of the world still have,)--supposing,\r\nI say, all this to be true, yet, when persons are reduced from ease and\r\naffluence to misery and distress, they naturally excite in the mind a\r\ngreater degree of compassion by comparing the circumstances in which\r\nthey once stood with those into which they are fallen: for famine,\r\ndegradation, and oppression were famine, degradation, and oppression to\r\nthose persons, even though they were as mean as Mr. Hastings chooses to\r\nrepresent them. But I hope, as you will sympathize with the great on\r\naccount of their condition, that you will sympathize with all mankind on\r\nthe ground of the common condition of humanity which belongs to us all;\r\ntherefore I hope your Lordships will not consider the calumny of Mr.\r\nHastings against those women as any other than as an aggravation of his\r\noffence against them. That is the light in which the House of Commons\r\nconsidered it; for they had heard both his in-door and out-door defence,\r\nand they still persevered in making the charge, and do persevere in\r\nmaking it still.\r\n\r\nWe have first stated what these women were,--in what light they stood\r\nwith the Nabob,--in what light they stood with the country at large. I\r\nhave now to state in what light they stood with the British government,\r\nprevious to this invasion of their rights; and we will prove they were\r\nthe actual subjects of a guaranty by the Company.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Extract from an Agreement made by Mr. Middleton, to all the\r\n     Particulars of which he engages to procure a Treaty from the Nabob\r\n     Asoph ul Dowlah, after his Arrival, and that he will also sign it,\r\n     as follows._\r\n\r\n     \"First, That, whenever the Begum shall choose to go to Mecca, she\r\n     shall be permitted to go.\r\n\r\n     \"Second, That, when the Nabob shall arrive, I [Mr. Middleton] will\r\n     procure suitable allowances to be made to the ladies of the zenanah\r\n     and the children of the late Nabob Sujah ul Dowlah, and take care\r\n     that they are paid.\r\n\r\n     \"Third, That the festivals (_shadee_) and marriages of the children\r\n     of the late Nabob Sujah ul Dowlah shall be at the disposal of the\r\n     Begum: whenever she thinks proper, she shall marry them; and\r\n     whatever money shall be necessary for these expenses shall be paid\r\n     by the Nabob.\r\n\r\n     \"Fourth, That the syer of Coda Gunge and Ali Gunge shall be\r\n     retained by the Begum as heretofore.\r\n\r\n     \"Fifth, That I [Mr. Middleton] will, upon the arrival of the Nabob,\r\n     procure Vizier Gunge and the garden of Sepoy Dand Khân, or their\r\n     equivalent, for the Begum.\r\n\r\n     \"Sixth, That I [Mr. Middleton] will endeavor to obtain from the\r\n     Nabob the sum of 1,150,000 rupees on account of the purchase of\r\n     Metchee Bohaun, and the house of Sahebjee, and the fort of the\r\n     Gossim, with the land and garden and the barraderry on the banks of\r\n     Goomply [Goomty?], and bazaar and garden of the house of Mahnarain\r\n     and the house of Beng Peofand at Lucknow: all of which the Nabob\r\n     Asoph ul Dowlah has assumed possession of.\r\n\r\n     \"Seventh, That I will settle with the Nabob the allowances to be\r\n     made in ready money to the ladies of the zenanah and others\r\n     specified, in the following amount: Total, 17 lacs 250 rupees per\r\n     month.\r\n\r\n     \"Eighth, Upon the arrival of the Nabob Asoph ul Dowlah Bahadur, I\r\n     will endeavor with all my influence to settle the monthly\r\n     allowances of Mohrum Ali Khân and Mahmud Eltifant Khân, &c., the\r\n     attendants of the Begums.\r\n\r\n     \"Ninth, That, if the Begum shall go to Mecca, she shall leave her\r\n     mahals and jaghires to the Begum, the mother of Asoph ul Dowlah,\r\n     who shall remit the revenues thereof to the Burree Begum: no one\r\n     shall prevent her enjoying her jaghires.\"\r\n\r\nNow, my Lords, we will read the copy of an engagement under the seal of\r\nthe Nabob Asoph ul Dowlah, and under the seal and signature, in English,\r\nof Mr. Middleton, as follows.\r\n\r\n     \"First, I, who am the Nabob Asoph ul Dowlah Bahadur, do agree that\r\n     the jaghires and the gunges and monthly allowance of the officers\r\n     and servants, and of the ladies of the zenanah, and of those\r\n     specified in the accounts annexed, shall be at the disposal and\r\n     under the management and authority of the Begum, and no one shall\r\n     oppose or prevent it: this I will punctually observe. In this\r\n     agreement Mr. Middleton and the English are engaged.\r\n\r\n     \"Second, Whenever the Begum may choose to go to Mecca, I will not\r\n     oppose it.\r\n\r\n     \"Third, Whenever the Begum should go to Mecca, she shall leave her\r\n     lands, jaghires, &c., either in the care of my mother or of me; and\r\n     I will procure bills for the amount of their revenues, and send\r\n     them to her: no one shall oppose this.\r\n\r\n     \"Fourth, The Begum shall have authority over all the ladies of her\r\n     zenanah; she shall let them remain with me, and not let them go\r\n     anywhere without my permission, or keep them with her.\r\n\r\n     \"Fifth, The jaghires Coda Gunge and Ali Gunge, &c., with the mahal\r\n     and syer belonging to the Begum and made over, shall remain as\r\n     heretofore in her possession: Total, 14,460 rupees per month.\r\n\r\n     \"Eighth, The Begum has authority over the ladies and attendants of\r\n     the zenanah; neither myself nor any one else will oppose it.\r\n\r\n     \"Ninth, The Begum, my grandmother, shall have the authority in all\r\n     festivals, and in the marriage of the children of the late Nabob\r\n     Sujah ul Dowlah, and, with the consent of my mother and myself,\r\n     shall regulate them: excepting in the festivals (_shadee_), the\r\n     authority is mine.\r\n\r\n     \"The English are guaranties to the above engagements, so long as\r\n     the Begum shall exist.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nYour Lordships will observe something here worthy of your notice. You\r\nwill first perceive, that the very treaty in which Mr. Hastings, by his\r\nrepresentative, Mr. Middleton, was a party concerned, supposes that the\r\nNabob Sujah ul Dowlah had other children besides the reigning prince by\r\nhis sole legitimate wife; and yet Mr. Hastings, in his defence, has\r\nthought proper, with a full knowledge of that circumstance, to doubt\r\nwhether there were any other children. You next see that these women\r\nhave Mr. Middleton's (that is, Mr. Hastings's) guaranty for the\r\nallowances which are made and settled upon them, and for the maintenance\r\nof their attendants, for the security and enjoyment of their own\r\npossessions, for their having a law officer of high rank, a moulavy, of\r\ntheir own. In short, there is a regular establishment formed for all\r\nthese women: they are not separated as a part distinct from the Begums,\r\nbut they are put by this very guaranty entirely under their management;\r\nthe maintenance of the children is secured; the whole order and economy\r\nof their establishment is delivered entirely to the Begum, the\r\ngrandmother, and the Begum, the mother, of the Nabob.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, you see that all these arrangements have the solemn guaranty\r\nof the Company, and that these women form a very considerable part of\r\nthat guaranty; and therefore your Lordships will not treat their\r\nsufferings, inflicted in violation of the Company's own settlement and\r\nguaranty, as a matter of no consideration for you.\r\n\r\nBut to proceed.--We have proved to your Lordships that the Nabob was\r\nreduced to a state of the greatest possible misery and distress; that\r\nhis whole revenue was sequestered into the hands of Mr. Hastings's\r\nagents; that by the treaty of Chunar he was to be relieved from the\r\nexpense of a body of troops with which he had been burdened without his\r\nown voluntary consent,--nay, more, the temporary brigade, which Mr.\r\nHastings proposed to take off, but kept on, which he considers not only\r\nas a great distress to his finances, but a dreadful scourge and calamity\r\nto his country,--there was a whole pension-list upon it, with such\r\nenormous pensions as 18,000_l._ a year to Sir Eyre Coote, and other\r\npensions, that Mr. Hastings proposed to take off, but did not; that, in\r\nproportion as the Nabob's distress increased, Mr. Hastings's demands\r\nincreased too; he was not satisfied, with taking from him for the\r\nCompany, but he took from him for himself; he demanded six hundred\r\nthousand pounds as a loan, when he knew he had neither money nor credit.\r\n\r\nThe consequence of these acts of violence was, that these people,\r\nbesieged by the English troops, and deprived of every resource, even of\r\nthe funds of charity, by which the protectors of the family, male and\r\nfemale, might have relieved them, but which the cruel rapacity of Mr.\r\nHastings had either entirely taken away or greatly diminished, were\r\nreduced to the last extremity of distress.\r\n\r\nAfter the length of time which has elapsed since we first brought these\r\nmatters with their proofs, I shall beg leave, before you go to judgment,\r\nto refresh your memory with a recital of a part of that evidence, in\r\norder that your Lordships may again fully and distinctly comprehend the\r\nnature and extent of the oppression, cruelty, and injustice committed by\r\nMr. Hastings, and by which you may estimate the punishment you will\r\ninflict upon him.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Letter from Captain Leonard Jaques to Richard Johnson, Esq.,\r\n     Resident at the Vizier's Court; March 6th, 1782._\r\n\r\n     \"Sir,--The women belonging to the Khord Mohul complain of their\r\n     being in want of every necessary of life, and are at last drove to\r\n     that desperation, that they at night get on the top of the zenanah,\r\n     make a great disturbance, and last night not only abused the\r\n     sentinels posted in the gardens, but threw dirt at them; they\r\n     threatened to throw themselves from the walls of the zenanah, and\r\n     also to break out of it. Humanity obliges me to acquaint you of\r\n     this matter, and to request to know if you have any direction to\r\n     give me concerning it. I also beg leave to acquaint you, I sent for\r\n     Letafit Ali Khân, the cojah who has the charge of them, who informs\r\n     me their complaint is well grounded,--that they have sold\r\n     everything they had, even to the clothes from their backs, and now\r\n     have no means of existing. Inclosed, I transmit you a letter from\r\n     Mandall on the subject.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Letter from Captain Jaques to Richard Johnson, Esq., March 7th,\r\n     1782._\r\n\r\n     \"Sir,--I beg leave to address you again concerning the women in the\r\n     Khord Mohul. Their behavior last night was so furious that there\r\n     seemed the greatest probability of their proceeding to the utmost\r\n     extremities, and that they would either throw themselves from the\r\n     walls or force the doors of the zenanah. I have made every inquiry\r\n     concerning the cause of their complaints, and find from Letafit Ali\r\n     Khân that they are in a starving condition, having sold all their\r\n     clothes and necessaries, and now have not wherewithal to support\r\n     nature. And as my instructions are quite silent upon this head,\r\n     should be glad to know how to proceed in case they were to force\r\n     the doors of the zenanah; as I suspect it will happen, should no\r\n     subsistence be very quickly sent to them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Letter from Major Gilpin to John Bristow, Esq., Resident at the\r\n     Court of Lucknow; 30th October, 1782._\r\n\r\n     \"Last night, about eight o'clock, the women in the Khord Mohul\r\n     Zenanah, under the charge of Letafit Ali Khân, assembled on the\r\n     tops of the buildings, crying in a most lamentable manner for\r\n     food,--that for the last four days they had got but a very scanty\r\n     allowance, and that yesterday they had got none. The melancholy\r\n     cries of famine are more easily imagined than described; and from\r\n     their representations, I fear that the Nabob's agents for that\r\n     business are very inattentive. I therefore think it requisite to\r\n     make you acquainted with the circumstance, that his Excellency the\r\n     Nabob may cause his agents to be more circumspect in their conduct\r\n     to these poor, unhappy women.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Letter from Mr. Bristow to Major Gilpin; Fyzabad, 4th November,\r\n     1782._\r\n\r\n     \"Sir,--I have received your letters of the 12th, 19th, 27th, and\r\n     30th ultimo. I communicated the contents of that of the 30th to the\r\n     minister, who promised me to issue orders for the payment of a sum\r\n     of money to relieve the distress of the Khord Mohul. I shall also\r\n     forward a bill for 10,000 rupees to you in the course of three or\r\n     four days; and if in the mean time you may find means to supply to\r\n     the amount of that sum, I will become personally responsible to\r\n     you for the repayment.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Letter from Major Gilpin to John Bristow, Esq., at the Court of\r\n     Lucknow; Fyzabad, 15th November, 1782._\r\n\r\n     \"Sir,--The repeated cries of the women in the Khord Mohul Zenanah\r\n     for subsistence have been truly melancholy. They beg most piteously\r\n     for liberty, that they may earn their daily bread by laborious\r\n     servitude, or be relieved from their misery by immediate death. In\r\n     consequence of their unhappy situation, I have this day taken the\r\n     liberty of drawing on you in favor of Ramnarain at ten days' sight,\r\n     for twenty son Kerah rupees, ten thousand of which I have paid to\r\n     Cojah Letafit Ali Khân, under whose charge that zenanah is.\"\r\n\r\nThese, my Lords, are the state of the distresses in the year 1782, and\r\nyour Lordships will see that they continued almost, with only occasional\r\nreliefs, during the period of that whole year. Now we enter into the\r\nyear 1783, to show you that it continued during the whole time; and then\r\nI shall make a very few remarks upon it.\r\n\r\nI will now read to your Lordships a part of Mr. Holt's evidence, by\r\nwhich it is proved that Mr. Hastings was duly advertised of all these\r\nmiserable and calamitous circumstances.\r\n\r\n    \"_Q._ Whether you saw a letter of intelligence from Fyzabad\r\n    containing a relation of the treatment of the women in the Khord\r\n    Mohul?--_A._ Yes, I did, and translated it.--_Q._ From whom did it\r\n    come?--_A._ Hoolas Roy.--_Q._ Who was he?--_A._ An agent of the\r\n    Resident at Fyzabad, employed for the purpose of transmitting\r\n    information to the Resident.--_Q._ Was that paper transmitted to\r\n    Mr. Hastings?--_A._ To the best of my recollection, it was\r\n    transmitted to the Board, after I had attested it.--_Q._ Do you\r\n    remember at what distance of time after the receipt of the\r\n    intelligence respecting the distresses of the Khord Mohul that paper\r\n    was transmitted to Calcutta?--_A._ I cannot say.--_Q._ Do you\r\n    believe it was transmitted within ten months after the time it was\r\n    received?--_A._ I understood it to be a letter received just before\r\n    it was transmitted.--_Q._ Then you understand it was transmitted\r\n    as soon as received?--_A._ Yes, in the course of three days.--_Q._\r\n    Can you bring to your mind the time at which the translation was\r\n    made?--_A._ To the best of my recollection, it was in January,\r\n    1784.--_Q._ Whether the distresses that had been complained of had\r\n    ceased for above a twelvemonth before the distresses of the Khord\r\n    Mohul?--_A._ I understood they were new distresses.--_Q._ Then you\r\n    state that that account transmitted in 1784 was, as you understand,\r\n    an account of new distresses?--_A._ Yes.\"\r\n\r\nI shall now refer your Lordships to page 899 of your printed Minutes.\r\n\r\n     [The Managers for the Commons acquainted the House, that they would\r\n     next read the paper of intelligence which had been authenticated by\r\n     Mr. Holt, in his evidence at the bar, relative to the miserable\r\n     situation of these women, which they meant to bring home to Mr.\r\n     Hastings.]\r\n\r\n\r\n     _An Extract of a Consultation of the 17th February, 1784._\r\n\r\n     \"At a Council: present, the Honorable Warren Hastings, Esq.,\r\n     Governor-General, President, Edward Wheler and John Stables,\r\n     Esqrs.; Mr. Macpherson absent from the Presidency for the benefit\r\n     of his health: the following letter and its inclosures were\r\n     received from Mr. Bristow on the 8th instant, and circulated.\r\n\r\n     \"'Honorable Sir, and Gentlemen,--I have the honor to forward, for\r\n     your further information, the inclosure No. 3; it contains a\r\n     relation of the hardships endured by the ladies of the late\r\n     Vizier's zenanah.'\r\n\r\n       (Signed) 'JOHN BRISTOW.'\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"_Translation of a Paper of Intelligence from Fyzabad._\r\n\r\n     \"'The ladies, their attendants, and servants were still as\r\n     clamorous as last night. Letafit, the darogah, went to them, and\r\n     remonstrated with them on the impropriety of their conduct, at the\r\n     same time assuring them that in a few days all their allowances\r\n     would be paid, and should that not be the case, he would advance\r\n     them ten days' subsistence, upon condition that they returned to\r\n     their habitations. None of them, however, consented to his\r\n     proposal, but were still intent upon making their escape through\r\n     the bazaar, and in consequence formed themselves in the following\r\n     order,--the children in the front, behind them the ladies of the\r\n     seraglio, and behind them again their attendants; but their\r\n     intentions were frustrated by the opposition which they met with\r\n     from Letafit's sepoys. The next day Letafit went twice to the\r\n     women, and used his endeavors to make them return into the zenanah,\r\n     promising to advance them ten thousand rupees, which, upon the\r\n     money being paid down, they agreed to comply with; but night coming\r\n     on, nothing transpired.\r\n\r\n     \"'On the day following, their clamors were more violent than usual.\r\n     Letafit went to confer with them on the business of yesterday,\r\n     offering the same terms. Depending upon the fidelity of his\r\n     promises, they consented to return to their apartments, which they\r\n     accordingly did, except two or three of the ladies, and most of\r\n     their attendants. Letafit went then to Hossmund Ali Khân, to\r\n     consult with him about what means they should take. They came to a\r\n     resolution of driving them in by force, and gave orders to their\r\n     sepoys to beat any one of the women who should attempt to move\r\n     forward; the sepoys accordingly assembled, and each one being\r\n     provided with a bludgeon, they drove them, by dint of beating, into\r\n     the zenanah. The women, seeing the treachery of Letafit, proceeded\r\n     to throw stones and bricks at the sepoys, and again attempted to\r\n     get out; but finding that impossible, from the gates being shut,\r\n     they kept up a continual discharge till about twelve o'clock, when,\r\n     finding their situation desperate, they returned into the Rung\r\n     Mohul, and forced their way from thence into the palace, and\r\n     dispersed themselves about the house and gardens. After this they\r\n     were desirous of getting into the Begum's apartments; but she,\r\n     being apprised of their intentions, ordered the doors to be shut.\r\n     In the mean time Letafit and Hossmund Ali Khân posted sentries to\r\n     secure the gates of the Lesser Mohul. During the whole of this\r\n     conflict, the ladies and women remained exposed to the view of the\r\n     sepoys.\r\n\r\n     \"'The Begum then sent for Letafit and Hossmund Ali Khân, whom she\r\n     severely reprimanded, and insisted upon knowing the cause of this\r\n     infamous behavior. They pleaded in their defence the impossibility\r\n     of helping it, as the treatment the women had met with had only\r\n     been conformable to his Excellency the Vizier's orders. The Begum\r\n     alleged, that, even admitting that the Nabob had given these\r\n     orders, they were by no means authorized in this manner to disgrace\r\n     the family of Sujah Dowlah, and should they not receive their\r\n     allowances for a day or two, it could be of no great moment; what\r\n     had passed was now at an end, but that the Vizier should certainly\r\n     be acquainted with the whole of the affair, and that whatever he\r\n     directed she should implicitly comply with. The Begum then sent for\r\n     two of the children who were wounded in the affray of last night,\r\n     and after endeavoring to soothe them, she again sent to Letafit and\r\n     Hossmund Ali Khân, and in the presence of the children again\r\n     expressed her disapprobation of their conduct, and the\r\n     improbability of Asoph ul Dowlah's suffering the ladies and\r\n     children of Sujah Dowlah to be disgraced by being exposed to the\r\n     view of the sepoys. Upon which Letafit produced the letter from the\r\n     Nabob, representing that he was amenable only to the order of his\r\n     Excellency, and that whatever he ordered it was his duty to obey;\r\n     and that, had the ladies thought proper to have retired quietly to\r\n     their apartments, he would not have used the means he had taken to\r\n     compel them. The Begum again observed, that what had passed was now\r\n     over. She then gave the children four hundred rupees and dismissed\r\n     them, and sent word by Sumrud and the other eunuchs, that, if the\r\n     ladies would peaceably retire to their apartments, Letafit would\r\n     supply them with three or four thousand rupees for their present\r\n     expenses, and recommended them not to incur any further disgrace,\r\n     and that, if they did not think proper to act agreeably to her\r\n     directions, they would do wrong. The ladies followed her advice,\r\n     and about ten at night went back to the zenanah. The next morning\r\n     the Begum waited upon the mother of Sujah Dowlah, and related to\r\n     her all the circumstances of the disturbance. The mother of Sujah\r\n     Dowlah returned for answer, that, after there being no accounts\r\n     kept by crores of revenue, she was not surprised that the family of\r\n     Sujah Dowlah, in their endeavors to procure subsistence, should be\r\n     obliged to expose themselves to the meanest of the people. After\r\n     bewailing their misfortunes and shedding many tears, the Begum took\r\n     her leave and returned home.'\"\r\n\r\nAs a proof of the extremity of the distress which reigned in the Khord\r\nMohul, your Lordships have been told that these women must have perished\r\nthrough famine, if their gaolers, Captain Jaques and Major Gilpin, had\r\nnot raised money upon their own credit, and supplied them with an\r\noccasional relief. And therefore, when they talk of his peculation, of\r\nhis taking but a bribe here and a bribe there, see the consequences of\r\nhis system of peculation, see the consequences of a usurpation which\r\nextinguishes the natural authority of the country, see the consequences\r\nof a clandestine correspondence that does not let the injuries of the\r\ncountry come regularly before the authorities in Oude to relieve it,\r\nconsider the whole mass of crimes, and then consider the sufferings that\r\nhave arisen in consequence of it.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, it was not corporal pain alone that these miserable women\r\nsuffered. The unsatisfied cravings of hunger and the blows of the\r\nsepoys' bludgeons could touch only the physical part of their nature.\r\nBut, my Lords, men are made of two parts,--the physical part, and the\r\nmoral. The former he has in common with the brute creation. Like theirs,\r\nour corporeal pains are very limited and temporary. But the sufferings\r\nwhich touch our moral nature have a wider range, and are infinitely more\r\nacute, driving the sufferer sometimes to the extremities of despair and\r\ndistraction. Man, in his moral nature, becomes, in his progress through\r\nlife, a creature of prejudice, a creature of opinions, a creature of\r\nhabits, and of sentiments growing out of them. These form our second\r\nnature, as inhabitants of the country and members of the society in\r\nwhich Providence has placed us. This sensibility of our moral nature is\r\nfar more acute in that sex which, I may say without any compliment,\r\nforms the better and more virtuous part of mankind, and which is at the\r\nsame time the least protected from the insults and outrages to which\r\nthis sensibility exposes them. This is a new source of feelings, that\r\noften make corporal distress doubly felt; and it has a whole class of\r\ndistresses of its own. These are the things that have gone to the heart\r\nof the Commons.\r\n\r\nWe have stated, first, the sufferings of the Begum, and, secondly, the\r\nsufferings of the two thousand women (I believe they are not fewer in\r\nnumber) that belong to them, and are dependent upon them, and dependent\r\nupon their well-being. We have stated to you that the Court of Directors\r\nwere shocked and astonished, when they received the account of the\r\nfirst, before they had heard the second. We have proved they desired him\r\nto redress the former, if, upon inquiry, he found that his original\r\nsuspicions concerning their conduct were ill-founded. He has declared\r\nhere that he did not consider these as orders. Whether they were orders\r\nor not, could anything have been more pressing upon all the duties and\r\nall the sentiments of man than at least to do what was just,--that is,\r\nto make such an inquiry as in the result might justify his acts, or have\r\nentitled them to redress? Not one trace of inquiry or redress do we\r\nfind, except we suppose, as we hear nothing after this of the famine,\r\nthat Mr. Bristow, who seems to be a man of humanity, did so effectually\r\ninterpose, that they should no longer depend for the safety of their\r\nhonor on the bludgeons of the sepoys, by which alone it seems they were\r\ndefended from the profane view of the vulgar, and which we must state as\r\na matter of great aggravation in this case.\r\n\r\nThe counsel on the other side say that all this intelligence comes in an\r\nanonymous paper without date, transmitted from a newspaper-writer at\r\nFyzabad. This is the contempt with which they treat this serious paper,\r\nsent to Mr. Hastings himself by official authority,--by Hoolas Roy, who\r\nwas the news-writer at Fyzabad,--the person appointed to convey\r\nauthentic intelligence concerning the state of it to the Resident at\r\nLucknow. The Resident received it as such; he transmitted it to Mr.\r\nHastings; and it was not till this hour, till the counsel were\r\ninstructed (God forgive them for obeying such instructions!) to treat\r\nthese things with ridicule, that we have heard this Hoolas Roy called a\r\ncommon news-writer of anonymous information, and the like. If the\r\ninformation had come in any way the least authentic, instead of coming\r\nin a manner the most authentic in which it was possible to come to Mr.\r\nHastings, he was bound by every feeling of humanity, every principle of\r\nregard to his own honor and his employers', to see whether it was true\r\nor false; if false, to refute it; if true, to afford redress: he has\r\ndone neither. Therefore we charge him with being the cause; we charge\r\nupon him the consequences, with all the aggravations attending them; and\r\nwe call both upon justice and humanity for redress, as far as it can be\r\nafforded to these people, and for the severest punishments which your\r\nLordships can inflict upon the author of these evils. If, instead of the\r\nmass of crimes that we have brought before you, this singly had been\r\ncharged upon the prisoner, I will say that it is a greater crime than\r\nany man has ever been impeached for before the House of Lords, from the\r\nfirst records of Parliament to this hour.\r\n\r\nI need not remind your Lordships of one particular circumstance in this\r\ncruel outrage. No excuse or pretence whatever is brought forward in its\r\njustification. With respect to the Begums, they have been charged with\r\nrebellion; but who has accused the miserable inhabitants of the Khord\r\nMohul of rebellion, or rebellious designs? What hearsay is there, even,\r\nagainst them of it? No: even the persons permitted by Mr. Hastings to\r\nrob and destroy the country, and who are stated by him to have been so\r\nemployed,--not one of that legion of locusts which he had sent into the\r\ncountry to eat up and devour the bread of its inhabitants, and who had\r\nbeen the cause both of the famine itself and of the inability of the\r\nBegums to struggle with it,--none of these people, I say, ventured even\r\na hearsay about these women.\r\n\r\nWere the sufferers few? There were eight hundred of them, besides\r\nchildren. Were they persons of any rank and consequence? We are told\r\nthat they were persons of considerable rank and distinction, connected\r\nwith and living under the protection of women of the first rank in Asia.\r\nWere they persons not deserving pity? We know that they were innocent\r\nwomen and children, not accused, and unsuspected, of any crime. He has\r\ntaken into his head to speak contemptuously of these women of the Khord\r\nMohul: but your Lordships will consider both descriptions generally with\r\nsome respect; and where they are not objects of the highest respect,\r\nthey will be objects of your compassion. Your Lordships, by your\r\navenging justice, will rescue the name of the British government from\r\nthe foulest disgrace which this man has brought upon it.\r\n\r\nAn account of these transactions, as we have proved by Mr. Holt's\r\nevidence, was regularly transmitted and made known to him. But why do I\r\nsay made known to him? Do not your Lordships know that Oude was\r\nhis,--that he treated it like his private estate,--that he managed it in\r\nall its concerns as if it were his private demesne,--that the Nabob\r\ndared not do a single act without him,--that he had a Resident there,\r\nnominated by himself, and forced upon the Nabob, in defiance of the\r\nCompany's orders? Yet, notwithstanding all this, we do not find a trace\r\nof anything done to relieve the aggravated distresses of these\r\nunfortunate people.\r\n\r\nThese are some of the consequences of that abominable system which, in\r\ndefiance of the laws of his country, Mr. Hastings established in Oude.\r\nHe knew everything there; he had spies upon his regular agents, and\r\nspies again upon them. We can prove, (indeed, he has himself proved,)\r\nthat, besides his correspondence with his avowed agents, Major Palmer\r\nand Major Davy, he had secret correspondence with a whole host of agents\r\nand pensioners, who did and must have informed him of every circumstance\r\nof these affairs. But if he had never been informed of it at all, the\r\nCommons contend, and very well and justly contend, that he who usurps\r\nthe government of a country, who extinguishes the authority of its\r\nnative sovereign, and places in it instruments of his own, and that in\r\ndefiance of those whose orders he was bound to obey, is responsible for\r\neverything that was done in the country. We do charge him with these\r\nacts of delinquencies and omissions, we declare him responsible for\r\nthem; and we call for your Lordships' judgment upon these outrages\r\nagainst humanity, as cruel perhaps as ever were suffered in any country.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, if there is a spark of manhood, if there is in your breasts\r\nthe least feeling for our common humanity, and especially for the\r\nsufferings and distresses of that part of human nature which is made by\r\nits peculiar constitution more quick and sensible,--if, I say, there is\r\na trace of this in your breasts, if you are yet alive to such feelings,\r\nit is impossible that you should not join with the Commons of Great\r\nBritain in feeling the utmost degree of indignation against the man who\r\nwas the guilty cause of this accumulated distress. You see women, whom\r\nwe have proved to be of respectable rank and condition, exposed to what\r\nis held to be the last of indignities in that country,--the view of a\r\nbase, insulting, ridiculing, or perhaps vainly pitying populace. You\r\nhave before you the first women in Asia, who consider their honor as\r\njoined with that of these people, weeping and bewailing the calamities\r\nof their house. You have seen that in this misery and distress the sons\r\nof the Nabob were involved, and that two of them were wounded in an\r\nattempt to escape: and yet this man has had the impudence to declare his\r\ndoubts of the Nabob's having had any children in the place, though the\r\naccount of what was going on had been regularly transmitted to him.\r\nAfter this, what is there in his conduct that we can wonder at?\r\n\r\nMy Lords, the maintenance of these women had been guarantied by the\r\nCompany; but it was doubly guarantied under the great seal of humanity.\r\nThe conscience of every man, and more especially of the great and\r\npowerful, is the keeper of that great seal, and knows what is due to its\r\nauthority. For the violation of both these guaranties, without even the\r\nvain and frivolous pretence of a rebellion, and for all its\r\nconsequences, Mr. Hastings is answerable; and he will not escape your\r\njustice by those miserable excuses which he has produced to the Court of\r\nDirectors, and which he has produced here in his justification. My\r\nLords, that justification we leave with your Lordships.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe now proceed to another part of our charge, which Mr. Hastings has not\r\nthought proper to deny, but upon which we shall beg leave to make a few\r\nobservations. You will first hear read to you, from the 17th article of\r\nour charge, the subject-matter to which we now wish to call your\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n     \"That in or about the month of March, 1783, three of the said\r\n     brothers of the Nabob, namely, Mirza Hyder Ali, Mirza Imayut Ali,\r\n     and Mirza Syef Ali, did represent to the said Bristow that they\r\n     were in distress for dry bread and clothes, and in consequence of\r\n     such representation were relieved by the intervention of the said\r\n     Bristow, but soon after the deputation of the said Warren Hastings\r\n     to Oude, in the year 1784, that is to say, some time in or about\r\n     the month of September, in the said year 1784, the said Mirza Hyder\r\n     Ali, one of the three princes aforesaid, did fly to the province of\r\n     Benares, and did remain there in great distress; and that, although\r\n     the said Warren Hastings did write to the said Nabob an account of\r\n     the aforesaid circumstances, in certain loose, light, and\r\n     disrespectful expressions concerning the said Mirza Hyder Ali, he\r\n     did not, as he was in duty bound to do, in any wise exert that\r\n     influence which he actually and notoriously possessed over the mind\r\n     of the said Nabob, for the relief of the said prince, the brother\r\n     of the said Nabob, but, without obtaining any satisfactory and\r\n     specific assurances, either from the said Nabob or the said\r\n     minister, the said Warren Hastings did content himself with\r\n     advising the said prince to return to his brother, the said Nabob.\"\r\n\r\nThe answer of Mr. Hastings to that part of the 17th article states:--\r\n\r\n     \"And the said Warren Hastings says, that in or about the month of\r\n     July, in the year 1783, a paper was received, inclosed in a letter\r\n     to the Governor-General and Council, from Mr. Bristow, purporting\r\n     to be a translation of a letter from three brothers of the said\r\n     Vizier, in which they did represent themselves to be in distress\r\n     for dry bread and clothes; but whether such distress actually\r\n     existed, and was relieved by the said Bristow, the said Warren\r\n     Hastings cannot set forth.\r\n\r\n     \"And the said Warren Hastings further says, that some time in the\r\n     month of September, 1784, the said Warren Hastings, being then at\r\n     Benares, did receive information that Mirza Hyder Ali was arrived\r\n     there, and the said Warren Hastings, not knowing before that time\r\n     that there was any such person, did write to the Nabob Vizier, to\r\n     the purport or effect following:--'A few days since I learnt that a\r\n     person called Mirza Hyder Ali was arrived at Benares, and calls\r\n     himself a son of the deceased Nabob Sujah ul Dowlah, and I was also\r\n     told that he came from Fyzabad; as I did not know whether he left\r\n     Fyzabad with or without your consent, I therefore did not pay him\r\n     much attention, and I now trouble you to give me every information\r\n     on this subject, how he came here, and what your intentions are\r\n     about him; he remains here in great distress, and I therefore wish\r\n     to know your sentiments.'\r\n\r\n     \"And the said Warren Hastings further says, that, having received\r\n     an answer from the said Vizier, he did, on or about the 13th of\r\n     October, 1784, inclose the same in a letter to the said Mirza, of\r\n     which letter the following is a copy:--'An answer is arrived to\r\n     what I wrote on your account to the Nabob Vizier, which I inclose\r\n     to you: having read it, you will send it back. I conceive you had\r\n     better go to the Nabob Vizier's presence, who will certainly afford\r\n     you protection and assistance. I will write what is proper to carry\r\n     with you to the Nabob, and it will in every respect be for your\r\n     good; whatever may be your intention on this head, you will write\r\n     to me.'\r\n\r\n     \"And the said Warren Hastings submits, that it was no part of his\r\n     duty as Governor-General to interfere with the said Vizier on\r\n     behalf of the said Mirza, or to obtain from the said Vizier any\r\n     specific assurances on the subject.\"\r\n\r\nContinuation of the 17th article of the charge:--\r\n\r\n     \"That, in order to avoid famine at home, another of the said\r\n     Nabob's brothers, by name Mirza Jungli, was under the necessity of\r\n     flying from his native country, and did seek protection from a\r\n     certain Mahometan lord called Mirza Shuffee Khân, then\r\n     prime-minister of the Mogul, from whom he did go to the camp of the\r\n     Mahratta chief Mahdajee Sindia, where he did solicit and obtain a\r\n     military command, together with a grant of lands, or jaghire, for\r\n     the subsistence of himself, his family, and followers; but wishing\r\n     again to be received under the protection of the British\r\n     government, the said Mirza Jungli, in 1783, did apply to the said\r\n     Resident Bristow, through David Anderson, Esquire, then on an\r\n     embassy in the camp of the said Sindia; and in consequence of such\r\n     application, the said Bristow, sensible of the disgrace which the\r\n     exile of the said Mirza Jungli reflected both on the said Nabob of\r\n     Oude and the British nation, did negotiate with the said Nabob and\r\n     his ministers for the return of the said Mirza Jungli, and for the\r\n     settlement and regular payment of some proper allowance for the\r\n     maintenance of the said Mirza Jungli; but the allowance required\r\n     was ultimately refused; and although the whole of the transactions\r\n     aforesaid were duly represented to the said Warren Hastings by the\r\n     said Anderson and by the said Bristow, and although he had himself\r\n     received, so early as the 23d of August, 1782, a letter from the\r\n     Vizier, grievously complaining of the cruel and extortious demands\r\n     made upon him by the said Warren Hastings, in which letter he did\r\n     expressly mention the flight of his brothers, and the distresses of\r\n     the women of his late father, who he said were all as his mothers,\r\n     and that his said brothers, from the resumption of their jaghires,\r\n     were reduced to great affliction and distress, and he did attribute\r\n     the said flight of some of his brethren, and the distresses of the\r\n     rest, and of the women who stood in a species of maternal relation\r\n     to him, as owing to the aforesaid oppressive demands, yet he, the\r\n     said Warren Hastings, did cruelly, inhumanly, and corruptly decline\r\n     to make any order for the better provision of any of the said\r\n     eminent family, or for the return of the said prince, who had fled\r\n     from his brother's court to avoid the danger of perishing by\r\n     famine.\"\r\n\r\nAnswer of Mr. Hastings to that part of the charge:--\r\n\r\n     \"And the said Warren Hastings further says, that he was informed\r\n     that Mirza Jungli, in the said article also mentioned, did leave\r\n     his native country in distress, and did go to Mirza Shuffee Khân,\r\n     in the said article also mentioned; and the said Warren Hastings\r\n     likewise admits he was informed that the said Mirza Jungli did\r\n     afterwards leave the said Mirza Shuffee Khân, and repair to the\r\n     camp of Mahdajee Sindia, with a view of obtaining some\r\n     establishment for himself and followers.\r\n\r\n     \"And the said Warren Hastings further says, that in certain letters\r\n     written by David Anderson, Esquire, and John Bristow, Esquire, it\r\n     was represented that the said Mirza Jungli did apply to the said\r\n     Bristow, through the said Anderson, then on an embassy in the camp\r\n     of the said Sindia, and that in consequence thereof the said\r\n     Bristow did, amongst other things, apply to the said Nabob Vizier\r\n     for a certain allowance to be made for the said Mirza, and for the\r\n     regular payment thereof, and that a certain allowance was\r\n     accordingly settled by the said Vizier on the said Mirza; and the\r\n     said Warren Hastings says, that information of the above\r\n     transactions was transmitted to the Board of Council, and that a\r\n     letter from the said Vizier was received on the 23d of August,\r\n     1782, containing certain representations of the distresses of\r\n     himself and his family; and he admits that no order was made by\r\n     him, the said Warren Hastings, for the provision of any of the said\r\n     family, or for the return of the said Mirza; but the said Warren\r\n     Hastings denies that he was guilty of any cruelty, inhumanity, or\r\n     corruption, or of any misconduct whatsoever, in the matters\r\n     aforesaid.\"\r\n\r\nContinuation of the charge:--\r\n\r\n     \"That some time in or about the month of December, 1783, the Nabob\r\n     Bahadur, another of the brothers of the said Nabob of Oude, did\r\n     represent to the said Bristow, that he, the said Nabob Bahadur, had\r\n     not received a farthing of his allowance for the current year, and\r\n     was without food; and being wounded by an assassin, who had also\r\n     murdered his aunt in the very capital of Oude, the said Nabob\r\n     Bahadur had not a daum to pay the surgeon, who attended him for the\r\n     love of God alone. That at or about the period of this said\r\n     representation the said Bristow was recalled, and the said Warren\r\n     Hastings proceeded up to Lucknow, but did not inquire into the said\r\n     representations transmitted by the said Bristow to Calcutta, nor\r\n     did order any relief.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings's answer to the part of the charge last read:--\r\n\r\n     \"And the said Warren Hastings further says, that on the 29th of\r\n     January, 1784, after the recall of the said Bristow, he, the said\r\n     Bristow, did transmit to the Governor-General and Council two\r\n     letters, one dated 28th of December, 1783, the other 7th of\r\n     January, 1784, purporting to be written by the said Nabob Bahadur,\r\n     addressed to him, the said Bristow, to the effect in the said\r\n     article stated; and the said Warren Hastings admits, that, when at\r\n     Lucknow, he did not institute any inquiry into the supposed\r\n     transaction in the said 17th article stated, or make any order\r\n     concerning the said Bahadur, and he denies that it was his duty so\r\n     to do.\"\r\n\r\nHere is the name of this Nabob from a list of the jaghiredars stated by\r\nMr. Purling, page 485 printed Minutes. Amongst the names of jaghiredars,\r\nthe times when granted, and the amount of the jaghires, there occurs\r\nthat of the Nabob Bahadur, with a grant of a jaghire of the amount of\r\n20,000 rupees.\r\n\r\n    [The _Lord Chancellor_ here remarked, that what had been\r\n    just read was matter of the 17th article of the charge\r\n    and parts of the answer to it, and that, upon looking\r\n    back to the former proceedings, it has escaped his\r\n    attention, if any matter contained in the 17th article\r\n    had been made matter of the charge; that it therefore\r\n    seemed to him that it could not be brought in upon a\r\n    reply, not having been made matter of the charge\r\n    originally.\r\n\r\n    _Mr. Burke._ My Lords, I have to say to this, that I\r\n    believe you have heard these facts made matter of charge\r\n    by the House of Commons, that I conceive they have been\r\n    admitted by the prisoner, and that the Commons have\r\n    nothing to do with the proofs of anything in their\r\n    charge which is fully and in terms admitted. The proofs\r\n    which they have produced to your Lordships were upon\r\n    matters which were contested; but here the facts are\r\n    admitted in the fullest manner. We neither have\r\n    abandoned them, intended to abandon them, or ever shall\r\n    abandon them; we have made them, as a charge, upon\r\n    record; the answers to them have been recorded, which\r\n    answers are complete admissions of every fact in the\r\n    charge.\r\n\r\n    _Lord Chancellor._ I do not make myself understood. The\r\n    objection is not that there has not been evidence given\r\n    upon the 17th article, but at the close of the case on\r\n    the part of the Managers for the House of Commons no\r\n    mention having been made of the matter contained in the\r\n    17th article, that therefore, although it may all have\r\n    been admitted by the answer to be true, yet in justice,\r\n    if from that answer you ground the charge, it is\r\n    necessary the defendant should be heard upon it.\r\n\r\n    _Mr. Burke._ If your Lordships choose that the defendant\r\n    shall be heard upon it, we have no kind of objection,\r\n    nor ever had, or proposed an objection to the defendant\r\n    being heard upon it. Your Lordships know that the\r\n    defendant's counsel value themselves upon having\r\n    abandoned their defence against certain parts of the\r\n    charge; your Lordships know that they declared that they\r\n    broke off thus in the middle of their defence in order\r\n    to expedite this business.\r\n\r\n    _Lord Chancellor._ Referring to the proceedings, I think\r\n    it a matter perfectly clear, that, in the course of the\r\n    charge, after certain articles had been gone through,\r\n    the Managers for the Commons closed the case there,\r\n    leaving therefore all the other articles, excepting\r\n    those that had been discussed, as matters standing with\r\n    the answers against them, but not insisted upon in\r\n    making out the charge. Of course, therefore, if the\r\n    defendant had gone into any of those articles, the\r\n    defendant must have been stopped upon them, because he\r\n    would then have been making a case in defence to that\r\n    which had not been made a case in the prosecution. The\r\n    objection, therefore, is not at all that no evidence has\r\n    been examined. To be sure, it would be an answer to that\r\n    to say, you are now proceeding upon an admission; but\r\n    even upon those facts that are admitted, (if the facts\r\n    are admitted that are insisted upon as matter in\r\n    charge,) that should come in the original state of the\r\n    cause, and the defendant in common justice must be heard\r\n    upon that, and then, and then only, come the\r\n    observations in reply.\r\n\r\n    _Mr. Burke._ We do not know, not are informed, that any\r\n    charge, information, or indictment, that is before the\r\n    court, and upon record, and is not denied by the\r\n    defendant, does not stand in full force against him. We\r\n    conceive it to be so; we conceive it to be agreeable to\r\n    the analogy of all proceedings; and the reason why we\r\n    did not go into and insist upon it was, that, having a\r\n    very long cause before us, and having the most full and\r\n    complete admission upon this subject, we did not proceed\r\n    further in it. The defendant defends himself by averring\r\n    that _it was not his duty_. It was not our business to\r\n    prove that it was his duty. It was he that admitted the\r\n    facts assumed to be the foundation of his duty; the\r\n    negative he was bound to prove, and he never offered to\r\n    prove it. All that I can say upon this point is, that\r\n    his delinquency in the matter in question appeared to us\r\n    to be a clear, distinct case,--to be a great\r\n    offence,--an offence charged upon the record, admitted\r\n    upon the record, and never by us abandoned. As to his\r\n    defence having been abandoned, we refer your Lordships\r\n    to the last petition laid by him upon your table, (that\r\n    libellous petition, which we speak of as a libel upon\r\n    the House of Commons,) and which has no validity but as\r\n    it asserts a matter of fact from the petitioner; and\r\n    there you will find that he has declared explicitly,\r\n    that, for the accommodation and ease of this business,\r\n    and for its expedition, he did abandon his defence at a\r\n    certain period.\r\n\r\n    _Lord Chancellor._ A charge consisting of a variety of\r\n    articles in their nature (however connected with each\r\n    other in their subject, but in their nature) distinct\r\n    and specific, if only certain articles are pressed in\r\n    the charge, to those articles only can a defence be\r\n    applied; and all the other articles, that are not made\r\n    matter of charge _originally_, have never, in the course\r\n    of any proceeding whatever, been taken up _originally_\r\n    in reply.\r\n\r\n    _Mr. Burke._ With great respect to your Lordship's\r\n    judgment, we conceive that the objection taken from our\r\n    not having at a certain period argued or observed upon\r\n    the prisoner's answer to the articles not insisted upon\r\n    is not conclusive; inasmuch as the record still stands,\r\n    and as our charge still stands. It was never abandoned;\r\n    and the defendant might have made a justification to it,\r\n    if he had thought fit: he never did think fit so to do.\r\n    If your Lordships think that we ought not to argue upon\r\n    it here in our reply, because we did not argue upon it\r\n    before,--well and good; but we have argued and do argue\r\n    in our reply many things to which he never gave any\r\n    answer at all. I shall beg leave, if your Lordships\r\n    please, to retire with my fellow Managers for a moment,\r\n    to consult whether we shall press this point or not. We\r\n    shall not detain your Lordships many minutes.\r\n\r\n    (_The Managers withdrew: in a few minutes the Managers\r\n    returned, again into the Hall._)\r\n\r\n    _Mr. Burke._ My Lords, the Managers have consulted among\r\n    themselves upon this business; they first referred to\r\n    your printed proceedings, in order to see the particular\r\n    circumstance on which the observation of your Lordship\r\n    is founded; we find it thus stated:--\"Then the Managers\r\n    for the Commons informed the Lords, that, saving to\r\n    themselves their undoubted rights and privileges, the\r\n    Commons were content to rest their charge here.\" We\r\n    rested our charge there, not because we meant to efface\r\n    any precedent matter of the charge which had been made\r\n    by us, and of which the facts had been admitted by the\r\n    defendant, but, simply saving our rights and privileges,\r\n    that is, to resume, (and to make new matter, if we\r\n    thought fit,) the Commons were content to rest the\r\n    charge there.\r\n\r\n    I have further to remark to your Lordships, that the\r\n    counsel for the defendant have opened a vast variety of\r\n    matter that is not upon record, either on our part or on\r\n    theirs, in order to illustrate and to support their\r\n    cause; and they have spoken day after day upon the\r\n    principles on which their defence was made. My great\r\n    object now is an examination of those principles, and to\r\n    illustrate the effects of these principles by examples\r\n    which are not the less cogent, the less weighty, and the\r\n    less known, because they are articles in this charge.\r\n    Most assuredly they are not. If your Lordships recollect\r\n    the speeches that were made here, you know that great\r\n    merit was given to Mr. Hastings for matters that were\r\n    not at all in the charge, and which would put us under\r\n    the greatest difficulties, if we were to take no notice\r\n    of them in our reply. For instance, his merits in the\r\n    Mahratta war, and a great mass of matter upon that\r\n    subject, were obliquely, and for other purposes, brought\r\n    before you, upon which they argued. That immense mass of\r\n    matter, containing an immense mass of principles, and\r\n    which was sometimes supported by alleged facts,\r\n    sometimes by none, they have opened and argued upon, as\r\n    matter relative to principle. In answer to their\r\n    argument, we propose to show the mischiefs that have\r\n    happened from the mischievous principles laid down by\r\n    Mr. Hastings, and the mischievous consequences of them.\r\n\r\n    If, however, after this explanation, your Lordships are\r\n    of opinion that we ought not to be allowed to take this\r\n    course, wishing to fall in with your Lordships'\r\n    sentiments, we shall abandon it. But we will remind your\r\n    Lordships that such things stand upon your records; that\r\n    they stand unanswered and admitted on your records; and\r\n    consequently they cannot be destroyed by any act of\r\n    ours, but by a renunciation of the charge, which\r\n    renunciation we cannot make, because the defendant has\r\n    clearly and fully admitted it to be founded in fact. We\r\n    cannot plead error; we cannot retract it. And why?\r\n    Because he has admitted it. We therefore only remind\r\n    your Lordships that the charge stands uncontradicted;\r\n    and that the observation we intended to make upon it was\r\n    to show your Lordships that the principles upon which he\r\n    defends all such conduct are totally false and\r\n    groundless. But though your Lordships should be of\r\n    opinion that we cannot press it, yet we cannot abandon\r\n    it; it is not in your power, it is not in our power, it\r\n    is not in his power to abandon that charge. You cannot\r\n    acquit him of that charge; it is impossible. If,\r\n    however, your Lordships, for the accommodation of\r\n    business, method of proceedings, or any circumstance of\r\n    that kind, wish we should say no more upon the subject,\r\n    we close the subject there. Your Lordships are in\r\n    possession both of the charge and the admission; and we\r\n    wish, and we cannot wish better than, to leave it as it\r\n    is upon the record.\r\n\r\n    The _Lord Chancellor_ here said,--The opinion of the\r\n    Lords can only be with me matter of conjecture. I\r\n    certainly was not commanded by the House to state the\r\n    observation that had occurred to me; but in the position\r\n    in which it now stands, I feel no difficulty in saying,\r\n    as my own judgment, that nothing can be matter in reply\r\n    that does not relate to those articles that were pressed\r\n    in the original charge; and therefore, in this position\r\n    of the business of reply, you cannot go into new matter\r\n    arising out of other articles that were not originally\r\n    insisted upon.\r\n\r\n    _Mr. Burke._ We were aware of the objection that might\r\n    be made to admitting our observations, if considered as\r\n    observations upon the 17th article, but not when\r\n    considered with reference to facts on the record before\r\n    you, for the purpose of disproving the principles upon\r\n    which the defendant and his counsel had relied: that was\r\n    the purpose for which we proposed chiefly to make them.\r\n    But your Lordship's [the Lord Chancellor's] own personal\r\n    authority will have great weight with us, and, unless we\r\n    perceive some other peer differ from you, we will take\r\n    it in the course we have constantly done. We never have\r\n    sent your Lordships out of the hall to consent\r\n    [consult?] upon a matter upon which that noble lord\r\n    appeared to have formed a decision in his own mind; we\r\n    take for granted that what is delivered from the\r\n    woolsack, to which no peer expresses a dissent, is the\r\n    sense of the House; as such we take it, and as such we\r\n    submit to it in this instance.\r\n\r\n    Therefore, leaving this upon the record as it stands,\r\n    without observing upon it, and submitting to your\r\n    Lordships' decision, that we cannot, according to order,\r\n    observe in reply upon what was not declared by us to be\r\n    a part of the charges we meant to insist upon, we\r\n    proceed to another business.]\r\n\r\nWe have already stated to your Lordships, and we beg to remind you of\r\nit, the state and condition of the country of Oude when Mr. Hastings\r\nfirst came to it,--his subsequent and immediate usurpation of all the\r\npowers of government, and the use he made of them,--the tyranny he\r\nexercised over the Nabob himself,--the tyranny he exercised upon his\r\nmother and grandmother, and all the other females of his family, and\r\ntheir dependants of every description, to the number of about eight\r\nhundred persons,--the tyranny exercised (though we are not at liberty\r\nto press it now) upon his brethren. We have shown you how he confiscated\r\nthe property of all the jaghiredars, the nobility of the country. We\r\nhave proved to your Lordships that he was well acquainted with all the\r\nmisery and distress occasioned by these proceedings, and that he\r\nafforded the sufferers no relief. We now proceed to review the effect of\r\nthis general mass of usurpation, tyranny, and oppression upon the\r\nrevenues and the prosperity of the country.\r\n\r\nYour Lordships will first be pleased to advert to the state in which Mr.\r\nHastings found the country,--in what state he found its revenues,--who\r\nwere the executive ministers of the government,--what their conduct was,\r\nand by whom they were recommended and supported. For the evidence of\r\nthese facts we refer your Lordships to your printed Minutes: there, my\r\nLords, they stand recorded: they never can be expunged out of your\r\nrecord, and the memory of mankind, whether we be permitted to press them\r\nat this time upon your Lordships or not. Your Lordships will there find\r\nin what manner the government was carried on in Oude in 1775, before the\r\nperiod of Mr. Hastings's usurpation. Mr. Hastings, you will find, has\r\nhimself there stated that the minister was recommended by the Begums;\r\nand you will remark this, because Mr. Hastings afterwards makes her\r\ninterference in the government of her son a part of his crimination of\r\nthe Begum.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Resident at the court of Oude thus writes on the 2d of March, 1775.\r\n\r\n     \"Notwithstanding the confidence the Nabob reposes in Murtezza Khân,\r\n     the Begums are much dissatisfied with his elevation. They\r\n     recommended to his Excellency to encourage the old servants of the\r\n     government, whose influence in the country, and experience, might\r\n     have strengthened his own authority, and seated him firmly on the\r\n     musnud. In some measure this, too, may appear consistent with the\r\n     interests of the Company; for, as Elija Khân and the old ministers\r\n     have by frequent instances within their own knowledge experienced\r\n     the power of our government, such men, I should conceive, are much\r\n     more likely to pay deference to the Company than a person who at\r\n     present can have but a very imperfect idea of the degree of\r\n     attention which ought to be paid to our connection with the Nabob.\"\r\n\r\nYour Lordships see that the Begums recommended the old servants,\r\ncontrary to the maxims of Rehoboam,--those who had served his father and\r\nhad served the country, and who were strongly inclined to support the\r\nEnglish interest there. Your Lordships will remark the effects of the\r\nBegum's influence upon the state of things in 1775, that the Nabob had\r\nbeen advised by his mother to employ the confidential servants of his\r\nfather,--persons conversant in the affairs of the country, persons\r\ninterested in it, and persons who were well disposed to support the\r\nEnglish connection. Your Lordships will now attend to a letter from Mr.\r\nBristow, at Lucknow, to the board, dated 28th November, 1775.\r\n\r\n     \"I also neglected no part of my duty on the spot, but advised the\r\n     minister, even at Lucknow, according to my letter of the 3d\r\n     instant, to recommend it to the Nabob to dismiss his useless and\r\n     mutinous troops, which measure seems by present appearances to have\r\n     succeeded beyond expectation: as the rest of the army do now pay\r\n     the greatest attention to his Excellency's orders; already the\r\n     complaints of the violences the troops used to commit are greatly\r\n     decreased; they profess obedience; and, by the best intelligence I\r\n     can obtain of their disposition, there seems to be little doubt\r\n     that the example made by disbanding Bussunt's corps has every good\r\n     effect we could wish, which had crossed the river and voluntarily\r\n     surrendered their arms the day before yesterday to the Nabob.\"\r\n\r\nHis next letter is dated 13th June, 1776.\r\n\r\n     \"Honorable Sir and Sirs,--It is Elija Khân's first object to\r\n     regulate the Vizier's revenue; and I must do him the justice to\r\n     say, that the short time he has been in office he has been\r\n     indefatigable, and already settled the greater part of the province\r\n     of Oude, and fixed on the districts for the assignments of the army\r\n     subsidy; Corah and Allahabad he has disposed of, and called for the\r\n     Dooab and Rohilcund accounts, in order to adjust them as soon as\r\n     possible. This activity will, I hope, produce the most salutary\r\n     effects,--as, the present juncture being the commencement of the\r\n     season for the cultivation, the aumils, by being thus early placed\r\n     in their offices, have the opportunity of advancing _tukavy_,\r\n     encouraging the ryots, and making their agreements in their several\r\n     districts, in letting under-farms, or disposing of the lands in\r\n     such a manner as they may judge most expedient. If, though similar\r\n     to the late minister's conduct, a delay of two or three months\r\n     should occur in the settlement of the lands, the people throughout\r\n     the country would be disheartened, and inevitably a very heavy\r\n     balance accrue on the revenue. I have troubled the honorable board\r\n     with this detail, in the first place, to show the propriety of\r\n     Elija Khân's conduct, and, in the next, the essential service that\r\n     will be rendered to the Vizier by continuing Colonel Parker's\r\n     detachment during the whole rains in Corah, if required by the\r\n     Vizier.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, you have now had a view of the state of Oude, previous to the\r\nfirst period of our connection with it. Your Lordships have seen and\r\nunderstand that part of the middle period, with which we do not mean to\r\ntrouble you again. You will now be pleased to attend to a letter from\r\nFyzoola Khân to the Governor-General, received the 13th of February,\r\n1778.\r\n\r\n     \"This country of Cuttah, which formerly depended on the Rohilla\r\n     States, and which I consider as now appertaining to the Company,\r\n     was very populous and flourishing; but since the commencement of\r\n     the Nabob Vizier's government, the farmers appointed by his\r\n     ministers have desolated the country. Its situation is at present\r\n     very ruinous; thousands of villages, formerly populous, are now\r\n     utterly deserted, and no trace left of them. I have already written\r\n     to Roy Buckstowr Sing a full account of the tyranny and oppression\r\n     exercised by the farmers, to be communicated to you: the constant\r\n     revenue of a country depends on the care of its rulers to preserve\r\n     it in a flourishing state. I have been induced to make the\r\n     representation by my attachment to the interest of the Company; for\r\n     otherwise it is no concern of mine. Should these oppressions\r\n     continue one or two years longer, and the rulers take no measures\r\n     to put a stop to them, the whole country will be a desert.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, upon these statements I have only to make this remark,--that\r\nyou have seen the first state of this country, and that the period when\r\nit had fallen into the state last described was about two years after\r\nMr. Hastings had obtained the majority in the Council and began to\r\ngovern this country by his lieutenants. We know that the country was put\r\nby him under military collectors: you see the consequences. The person\r\nwho makes this representation to Mr. Hastings of the state of the\r\ncountry, of its distress and calamity, and of the desolation of a\r\nthousand of the villages formerly flourishing in it, is no less a person\r\nthan a prince of a neighboring country, a person of whom you have often\r\nheard, and to whom the cause of humanity is much indebted, namely,\r\nFyzoola Khân,--a prince whose country the English Resident, travelling\r\nthrough, declares to be cultivated like a garden. That this was the\r\nstate of the Rohilla country is owing to its having very fortunately\r\nbeen one of those that escaped the dominion of Mr. Hastings.\r\n\r\nWe will now read to your Lordships a letter from Sir Eyre Coote to the\r\nboard at Calcutta, dated the 11th of September, 1779.\r\n\r\n     \"Honorable Sir and Sirs,--The day before yesterday I encamped near\r\n     Allahabad, where the Vizier did me the honor of a visit; and\r\n     yesterday morning, in my way hither, I returned it, and was\r\n     received by his Excellency with every mark of respect and\r\n     distinction. This morning he called here, and we had some general\r\n     conversation, which principally turned upon the subject of his\r\n     attachment to the English, and his readiness to show the sincerity\r\n     of it upon all occasions. It is to be wished we had employed the\r\n     influence which such favorable sentiments must have given us more\r\n     to the benefit of the country and ourselves; but I fear the\r\n     distresses which evidently appear on the face of the one, and the\r\n     failure of the revenues to the other, are not to be wholly ascribed\r\n     to the Vizier's mismanagement.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the testimony of Mr. Hastings's own pensioner, Sir Eyre Coote,\r\nrespecting the known state of the country during the time of this\r\nhorrible usurpation, which Sir Eyre Coote mentions under the soft name\r\nof our _influence_. But there could be but one voice upon the subject,\r\nand that your Lordships shall now hear from Mr. Hastings himself. We\r\nrefer your Lordships to the Minute of the Governor-General's\r\nConsultation, Fort William, 21st May, 1781: he is here giving his\r\nreasons for going into the upper provinces.\r\n\r\n     \"The province of Oude having fallen into a state of great disorder\r\n     and confusion, its resources being in an extraordinary degree\r\n     diminished, and the Nabob Asoph ul Dowlah having earnestly\r\n     entreated the presence of the Governor-General, and declared, that,\r\n     unless some effectual measures are taken for his relief, he must be\r\n     under the necessity of leaving his country, and coming down to\r\n     Calcutta, to present his situation to this government,--the\r\n     Governor-General therefore proposes, with the concurrence of Mr.\r\n     Wheler, to visit the province of Oude as speedily as the affairs of\r\n     the Presidency will admit, in hopes that, from a minute and\r\n     personal observation of the circumstances of that country, the\r\n     system of management which has been adopted, and the characters\r\n     and conduct of the persons employed, he may possibly be able to\r\n     concert and establish some plan by which the province of Oude may\r\n     in time be restored to its former state of affluence, good order,\r\n     and prosperity.\"\r\n\r\nYour Lordships have now the whole chain of the evidence complete, with\r\nregard to the state of the country, up to the period of Mr. Hastings's\r\njourney into the country. You see that Mr. Hastings himself admits it to\r\nhave been formerly in a most flourishing, orderly, and prosperous state.\r\nIts condition in 1781 he describes to you in words than which no enemy\r\nof his can use stronger, in order to paint the state in which it then\r\nwas. In this state he found it, when he went up in the year 1781; and he\r\nleft it, with regard to any substantial regulation that was executed or\r\ncould be executed, in the state in which he found it,--after having\r\nincreased every one of those grievances which he pretended to redress,\r\nand taken from it all the little resources that remained in it.\r\n\r\nWe now come to a subsequent period, at which time the state of the\r\ncountry is thus described by Mr. Bristow, on the 12th December, 1782.\r\n\r\n     \"Despotism is the principle upon which every measure is founded,\r\n     and the people in the interior parts of the country are ruled at\r\n     the discretion of the aumil or foujdar for the time being. They\r\n     exercise, within the limits of their jurisdiction, the powers of\r\n     life and death, and decisions in civil and other cases, in the same\r\n     extent as the sovereign at the capital. The forms prescribed by the\r\n     ancient institutions of the Mogul empire are unattended to, and the\r\n     will of the provincial magistrate is the sole law of the people.\r\n     The total relaxation of the Vizier's authority, his inattention and\r\n     dislike to business, leave the aumils in possession of this\r\n     dangerous power, unawed, uncontrolled by any apprehension of\r\n     retrospection, or the interference of justice. I can hardly quote\r\n     an instance, since the Vizier's accession to the musnud, of an\r\n     aumil having been punished for oppression, though the complaints of\r\n     the people and the state of the country are notorious proofs of the\r\n     violences daily committed: it is even become unsafe for travellers\r\n     to pass, except in large bodies; murders, thefts, and other\r\n     enormities shocking to humanity, are committed in open day.\"\r\n\r\nIn another paragraph of the same letter, he says,--\r\n\r\n     \"Such has been the system of this government, that the oppressions\r\n     have generally originated with the aumils. They have been rarely\r\n     selected for their abilities or integrity, but from favor, or the\r\n     means to advance a large sum upon being appointed to their office.\r\n     The aumil enters upon his trust ruined in reputation and fortune;\r\n     and unless he accomplishes his engagements, which is seldom the\r\n     case, disgrace and punishment follow. Though the balance of revenue\r\n     may be rigorously demanded of him, it has not been usual to\r\n     institute any inquiry for oppression. The zemindars, thus left at\r\n     the mercy of the aumils, are often driven to rebellion. The weak\r\n     are obliged to submit to his exactions, or fly the country; and the\r\n     aumil, unable to reduce the more powerful, is compelled to enter\r\n     into a disgraceful compromise. Every zemindar looks to his fort for\r\n     protection, and the country is crowded with them: Almas Ali Khân\r\n     asserts there are not less than seven hundred in his districts.\r\n     Hence it has become a general custom to seize the brother, son, or\r\n     some near relation or dependant of the different zemindars, as\r\n     hostages for the security of the revenue: a great aumil will\r\n     sometimes have three or four hundred of these hostages, whom he is\r\n     obliged to confine in places of security. A few men like Almas Ali\r\n     Khân and Coja Ain ul Din have, from their regularity in the\r\n     performance of pecuniary engagements, rendered themselves useful to\r\n     the Vizier. A strict scrutiny into his affairs was at all times\r\n     irksome to his Excellency, and none of the ministers or officers\r\n     about his person possessing the active, persevering spirit\r\n     requisite to conduct the detail of engagements for a number of\r\n     small farms, it became convenient to receive a large sum from a\r\n     great farmer without trouble or deficiency. This system was\r\n     followed by the most pernicious consequences; these men were above\r\n     all control, they exacted their own terms, and the districts they\r\n     farmed were most cruelly oppressed. The revenue of Rohilcund is\r\n     reduced above a third, and Almas Ali Khân's administration is well\r\n     known to have been extremely violent.\"\r\n\r\nWe will next read to your Lordships an extract from Captain Edwards's\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\n    \"_Q._ Had you any opportunity of observing the general face of the\r\n    country in the time of Sujah Dowlah?--_A._ I had.--_Q._ Did you\r\n    remark any difference in the general state of the country at that\r\n    time and the period when you made your latter observation?--did you\r\n    observe any difference between the condition of the country at that\r\n    time, that of Sujah Dowlah in the year 1774, and the latter period\r\n    you have mentioned?--_A._ I did,--a very material difference.--_Q._\r\n    In what respect?--_A._ In the general aspect that the country bore,\r\n    and the cultivation of the country,--that it was infinitely better\r\n    cultivated in 1774 than it was in 1783.--_Q._ You said you had no\r\n    opportunity of observing the face of the country till you was\r\n    appointed aide-de-camp to the Nabob?--_A._ No,--except by marching\r\n    and countermarching. I marched in the year 1774 through the Nabob\r\n    Sujah ul Dowlah's provinces into Rohilcund.--_Q._ Had you those\r\n    opportunities from the time of your going there in 1774?--_A._ I\r\n    had; but not so much as I had after being appointed aide-de-camp to\r\n    the Vizier, because I was always before in a subordinate situation:\r\n    I marched in a direct line before, with the troops; but afterwards,\r\n    when I was aide-de-camp to his Excellency, I was my own master, and\r\n    made frequent excursions into the different parts of the\r\n    country.--_Q._ Had you an opportunity of observing the difference in\r\n    the general happiness and disposition of the people?--_A._ I\r\n    had.--_Q._ Did you observe a difference in that respect also between\r\n    your first coming and the year 1783?--_A._ Yes, a very sensible\r\n    difference: in Sujah ul Dowlah's time the country was in a very\r\n    flourishing state, in merchandise, cultivation, and every article of\r\n    commerce, and the people then seemed to be very happy under his\r\n    government, which latterly was not the case; because the country in\r\n    reality appeared in the year 1774 in a flourishing state, and in the\r\n    year 1783 it appeared comparatively forlorn and desolate.--_Q._ Was\r\n    the court of Asoph ul Dowlah, when you left India, equal in point\r\n    of splendor to what it was in the time of Sujah ul Dowlah?--_A._ By\r\n    no means: it was not equally splendid, but far inferior.--_Q._ Were\r\n    the dependants and officers belonging to the court paid in the same\r\n    punctual manner?--_A._ No: I really cannot say whether they were\r\n    paid more regularly in Sujah Dowlah's time, only they appeared more\r\n    wealthy and more able to live in a splendid style in his time than\r\n    they ever have done since his death.\"\r\n\r\nHere, then, your Lordships see the state of the country in 1783. Your\r\nLordships may trace the whole progress of these evils, step by step,\r\nfrom the death of Sujah ul Dowlah to the time of Mr. Hastings's\r\nobtaining a majority in the Council, after which he possessed the sole\r\nand uncontrolled management of the country; you have seen also the\r\nconsequences that immediately followed till the year 1784, when he went\r\nup a second time into the country.\r\n\r\nI do not know, my Lords, that it is necessary to make any observation\r\nupon this state of things. You see that the native authority was, as we\r\nhave proved, utterly extinguished by Mr. Hastings, and that there was\r\nno superintendent power but his. You have heard of the oppressions of\r\nthe farmers of the revenues; and we have shown you that these farmers\r\ngenerally were English officers. We have shown you in what manner\r\nColonel Hannay, one of these farmers sent by Mr. Hastings, acted, and\r\nparticularly the accumulation of hostages which were made by him. We\r\nhave shown you, that by their arbitrary and tyrannical proceedings all\r\nregular government was subverted, and that the country experienced the\r\nlast and most dreadful effects of anarchy. We have shown you that no\r\nother security was left to any human being, but to intrench themselves\r\nin such forts as they could make, and that these forts, in one district\r\nonly of the country, had increased in number to the amount of seven\r\nhundred. Your Lordships also know, that, when the prisons and mud forts\r\nin which Colonel Hannay kept his hostages confined were full, he kept\r\nthem in uncovered cages in the open air. You know that all these farmers\r\nof revenue were either English and military men, or natives under an\r\nabject submission to them; you know that they had the whole country in\r\nassignments, that the jaghires were all confiscated for their benefits;\r\nand you find that the whole system had its origin at the time when Mr.\r\nHastings alone formed in effect the authority of the Supreme Council.\r\nThe weakness of the Nabob, as Sir Eyre Coote tells you, could not have\r\nbeen alone the cause of these evils, and that our influence over him, if\r\nnot actually the cause of the utter ruin, desolation, and anarchy of\r\nthat country, might have been successfully exerted in preventing.\r\n\r\nWhen your Lordships shall proceed to judgment upon these accumulated\r\nwrongs, arising out of the usurped power of the prisoner at your bar,\r\nand redressed by him in no one instance whatever, let not the usurpation\r\nitself of the Nabob's power be considered as a trivial matter. When any\r\nprince at the head of a great country is entirely stripped of everything\r\nin his government, civil or military, by which his rank may be\r\ndistinguished or his virtues exercised, he is in danger of becoming a\r\nmere animal, and of abandoning himself wholly to sensual gratifications.\r\nFeeling no personal interest in the institutions or in the general\r\nwelfare of the country, he suffers the former (and many wise and\r\nlaudable institutions existed in the provinces of the Nabob, for their\r\ngood order and government) to fall into disuse, and he leaves the\r\ncountry itself to persons in inferior situations, to be wasted and\r\ndestroyed by them. You find that in Oude, the very appearance of justice\r\nhad been banished out of it, and that every aumil exercised an arbitrary\r\npower over the lives and fortunes of the people. My Lords, we have the\r\nproofs of all these facts in our hands; they are in your Lordships'\r\nminutes; and though we can state nothing stronger than is stated in the\r\npapers themselves, yet we do not so far forget our duty as not to point\r\nout to your Lordships such observations as arise out of them.\r\n\r\nTo close the whole, your Lordships shall how hear read an extract from a\r\nmost curious and extraordinary letter, sent by him to the Court of\r\nDirectors, preparatory to his return to England.\r\n\r\n     \"My only remaining fear is, that the members of the Council, seeing\r\n     affairs through a different medium from that through which I view\r\n     them, may be disposed, if not to counteract the system which I have\r\n     formed, to withhold from it their countenance and active support.\r\n     While I myself remain, it will be sufficient if they permit it to\r\n     operate without interruption; and I almost hope, in the event of a\r\n     new administration of your affairs which shall confine itself to\r\n     the same forbearance, and manifest no symptoms of intended\r\n     interference, the objects of my arrangements will be effectually\r\n     attained; for I leave them in the charge of agents whose interests,\r\n     ambition, and every prospect of life are interwoven with their\r\n     success, and the hand of Heaven has visibly blest the soil with\r\n     every elementary source of progressive vegetation: but if a\r\n     different policy shall be adopted, if new agents are sent into the\r\n     country and armed with authority for the purpose of vengeance or\r\n     corruption, to no other will they be applied. If new demands are\r\n     raised on the Nabob Vizier, and accounts overcharged on one side\r\n     with a wide latitude taken on the other to swell his debt beyond\r\n     the means of payment,--if political dangers are portended, to\r\n     ground on them the pleas of burdening his country with unnecessary\r\n     defences and enormous subsidies,--or if, even abstaining from\r\n     direct encroachment on the Nabob's rights, your government shall\r\n     show but a degree of personal kindness to the partisans of the late\r\n     usurpation, or by any constructive indication of partiality and\r\n     disaffection furnish ground for the expectation of an approaching\r\n     change of system, I am sorry to say that all my labors will prove\r\n     abortive; for the slightest causes will be sufficient to deject\r\n     minds sore with the remembrance of past conflicts, and to elevate\r\n     those whose only dependence is placed in the renewal of the\r\n     confusion which I have labored with such zeal to eradicate, and\r\n     will of course debilitate the authority which can alone insure\r\n     future success. I almost fear that this denunciation of effects\r\n     from causes so incompetent, as they will appear to those who have\r\n     not had the experience which I have had of the quick sensibility\r\n     which influences the habits of men placed in a state of polity so\r\n     loose, and subject to the continual variations of capricious and\r\n     despotic authority, will be deemed overcharged, or perhaps void of\r\n     foundation; nor, if they should come to pass, will it be easy to\r\n     trace them with any positive evidence to their connection: yet it\r\n     is my duty to apprise you of what I apprehend, on grounds which I\r\n     deem of absolute certainty, may come to pass; and I rely on your\r\n     candor for a fair interpretation of my intention.\"\r\n\r\nHere, my Lords, the prisoner at your bar has done exactly what his\r\nbitterest accuser would do: he goes through, head by head, every one of\r\nthe measures which he had himself pursued in the destruction of the\r\ncountry; and he foretells, that, if any one of those measures should\r\nagain be pursued, or even if good cause should be given to suspect they\r\nwould be renewed, the country must fall into a state of inevitable\r\ndestruction. This supersedes all observation. This paper is a\r\nrecapitulated, minute condemnation of every step which he took in that\r\ncountry, and which steps, are every one of them upon your Lordships'\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\nBut, my Lords, we know very well the design of these pretended\r\napprehensions, and why he wished to have that country left in the state\r\nhe speaks of. He had left a secret agent of his own to control that\r\nostensible government, and to enable him, sitting in the place where he\r\nnow sits, to continue to govern those provinces in the way in which he\r\nnow governs them.\r\n\r\n     [_A murmur having arisen here, Mr. Burke proceeded._]\r\n\r\nIf I am called upon to reword what I have just said, I shall repeat my\r\nwords, and show strong grounds and reasons to indicate that he governs\r\nOude now as much as he ever did.\r\n\r\nYou see, my Lords, that the reform which he pretended to make in 1781\r\nproduced the calamities which he states to have existed in 1784. We\r\nshall now show that the reform which he pretended to make in 1784\r\nbrought on the calamities which Lord Cornwallis states in his evidence\r\nto have existed in 1787.\r\n\r\nWe will now read two letters from Lord Cornwallis: the first is dated\r\nthe 16th November, 1787.\r\n\r\n     \"I was received at Allahabad and attended to Lucknow by the Nabob\r\n     and his ministers with every mark of friendship and respect. I\r\n     cannot, however, express how much I was concerned, during my short\r\n     residence at his capital, and my progress through his dominions, to\r\n     be witness of the disordered state of his finances and government,\r\n     and of the desolate appearances of his country. The evils were too\r\n     alarming to admit of palliation, and I thought it my duty to exhort\r\n     him, in the most friendly manner, to endeavor to apply effectual\r\n     remedies to them. He began with urging as apology, that, whilst he\r\n     was not certain of the expense [extent?] of our demands upon him,\r\n     he had no real interest in being economical in his expenses, and\r\n     that, while we interfered in the internal management of his\r\n     affairs, his own authority and that of his ministers were despised\r\n     by his own subjects. It would have been useless to discuss these\r\n     topics with him; but while I repeated my former declarations of our\r\n     being determined to give no ground in future for similar\r\n     complaints, he gave me the strongest assurances of his being\r\n     resolved to apply himself earnestly to the encouragement of\r\n     agriculture, and to endeavor to revive the commerce of his\r\n     country.\"\r\n\r\nThe second is dated the 25th April, 1788.\r\n\r\n     \"Till I saw the Vizier's troops, I was not without hope that upon\r\n     an emergency he would have been able to have furnished us with some\r\n     useful cavalry; but I have no reason to believe that he has any in\r\n     his service upon which it would be prudent to place any dependence;\r\n     and I think it right to add, that his country appears to be in so\r\n     ruined a state, and his finances in so much disorder, that even in\r\n     case of war we ought not to depend upon any material support from\r\n     him.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, I have only to remark upon these letters, that, so far as they\r\ngo, they prove the effects of Mr. Hastings's reformation, from which he\r\nwas pleased to promise the Company such great things. But when your\r\nLordships know that he had left his dependant and minister, Hyder Beg\r\nKhân, there, whose character, as your Lordships will find by a reference\r\nto your minutes he has represented as black as hell, to be the real\r\ngovernor there, and to carry on private correspondence with him here,\r\nand that he had left Major Palmer, his private agent, for a considerable\r\ntime in that country to carry on his affairs, your Lordships will easily\r\nsee how it has come to pass that the Vizier, such a man as you have\r\nheard him described to be, was not alone able to restore prosperity to\r\nhis country.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, you have now seen what was the situation of the country in\r\nSujah Dowlah's time, prior to Mr. Hastings's interference with the\r\ngovernment of it, what it was during his government, and what situation\r\nit was in when Lord Cornwallis left it. Nothing now remains but to call\r\nyour Lordships' attention to perhaps the most extraordinary part of\r\nthese transactions. But before we proceed, we will beg leave to go back\r\nand read to your Lordships the Nabob's letter of the 24th February,\r\n1780.\r\n\r\n     \"I have received your letter, and understand the contents. I cannot\r\n     describe the solidity of your friendship and brotherly affection\r\n     which subsisted between you and my late father. From the friendship\r\n     of the Company he received numberless advantages; and I,\r\n     notwithstanding I was left an orphan, from your favor and that of\r\n     the Company was perfectly at ease, being satisfied that everything\r\n     would be well, and that I should continue in the same security that\r\n     I was during my father's lifetime, from your protection. I\r\n     accordingly, from the day of his death, have never omitted to\r\n     cultivate your favor, and the protection of the Company; and\r\n     whatever was the desire and directions of the Council at that time\r\n     I have ever since conformed to, and obeyed with readiness. Thanks\r\n     be given to God that I have never as yet been backward in\r\n     performing the will of the English Company, of the Council, and of\r\n     you, and have always been from my heart ready to obey them, and\r\n     have never given you any trouble from my difficulties or wishes.\r\n     This I have done simply from my own knowledge of your favor towards\r\n     me, and from my being certain that you would learn the particulars\r\n     of my distresses and difficulties from other quarters, and would\r\n     then show your friendship and good-will in whatever was for my\r\n     advantage. But when the knife had penetrated to the bone, and I was\r\n     surrounded with such heavy distresses that I could no longer live\r\n     in expectations, I then wrote an account of my difficulties. The\r\n     answer which I have received to it is such, that it has given me\r\n     inexpressible grief and affliction. I never had the least idea or\r\n     expectation from you and the Council that you would ever have\r\n     given your orders in so afflicting a manner, in which you never\r\n     before wrote, and which I could not have imagined. As I am resolved\r\n     to obey your orders, and directions of the Council, without any\r\n     delay, as long as I live, I have, agreeably to those orders,\r\n     delivered up all my private papers to him [the Resident], that,\r\n     when he shall have examined my receipts and expenses, he may take\r\n     whatever remains. As I know it to be my duty to satisfy you, the\r\n     Company, and Council, I have not failed to obey in any instance,\r\n     but requested of him that it might be done so as not to distress me\r\n     in my necessary expenses: there being no other funds but those for\r\n     the expenses of my mutsuddies, household expenses, and servants,\r\n     &c. He demanded these in such a manner, that, being remediless, I\r\n     was obliged to comply with what he required. He has accordingly\r\n     stopped the pensions of my old servants for thirty years, whether\r\n     sepoys, mutsuddies, or household servants, and the expenses of my\r\n     family and kitchen, together with the jaghires of my grandmother,\r\n     mother, and aunts, and of my brothers and dependants, which were\r\n     for their support. I had raised fifteen hundred horse and three\r\n     battalions of sepoys to attend upon me; but, as I have no resources\r\n     to support them, I have been obliged to remove the people stationed\r\n     in the mahals, and to send his people into the mahals, so that I\r\n     have not now one single servant about me. Should I mention what\r\n     further difficulties I have been reduced to, it would lay me open\r\n     to contempt. Although I have willingly assented to this which\r\n     brings such distress on me, and have in a manner altogether ruined\r\n     myself, yet I failed not to do it for this reason, because it was\r\n     for your satisfaction, and that of the Council; and I am patient,\r\n     and even thankful, in this condition; but I cannot imagine from\r\n     what cause you have conceived displeasure against me. From the\r\n     commencement of my administration, in every circumstance, I\r\n     received strength and security from your favor, and that of the\r\n     Council; and in every instance you and the Council have shown your\r\n     friendship and affection for me; but at present, that you have sent\r\n     these orders, I am greatly perplexed.\"\r\n\r\nWe will not trouble your Lordships with the remainder of the letter,\r\nwhich is all in the same style of distress and affliction, and of the\r\nabject dependence of a man who considers himself as insulted, robbed,\r\nand ruined in that state of dependence.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the evidence contained in this letter, your Lordships\r\nwill be pleased to recollect the Nabob's letter which we read to your\r\nLordships yesterday, the humble and abject style of which you will never\r\nforget. Oh, consider, my Lords, this instance of the fate of human\r\ngreatness! You must remember that there is not a trace anywhere, in any\r\nof the various trunks of Mr. Hastings, that he ever condescended so much\r\nas to give an answer to the suppliant letters of that unhappy man. There\r\nwas no mode of indignity with which he did not treat his family; there\r\nwas no mode of indignity with which he did not treat his person; there\r\nwas no mode of indignity with which he did not treat his minister, Hyder\r\nBeg Khân,--this man whom he represents to be the most infamous and\r\nscandalous of mankind, and of whom he, nevertheless, at the same time\r\ndeclares, that his only support with the Vizier was the support which\r\nhe, Warren Hastings, as representative of the English government, gave\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nWe will now read a paper which perhaps ought not to have been received\r\nin evidence, but which we were willing to enter in your minutes as\r\nevidence, in order that everything should come before you. Your\r\nLordships have heard the Nabob speak of his misery, distress, and\r\noppression; but here he makes a complete defeasance, as it were, of the\r\nwhole charge, a direct disavowal of every one of the complaints, and\r\nparticularly that of having never received an answer to these\r\ncomplaints. Oh, think, I say, my Lords, of the degraded, miserable, and\r\nunhappy state to which human nature may be reduced, when you hear this\r\nunhappy man declare that all the charges which we have made upon this\r\nsubject relative to him, and which are all either admitted by him or\r\ntaken from his own representation, are now stated by him in a paper\r\nbefore you to be all false, and that there is not a word of the\r\nrepresentation which he had made of Mr. Hastings that has the least\r\ntruth in it! Your Lordships will find this in that collection of various\r\npapers which ought to be preserved and put into every museum in Europe,\r\nas one of the most extraordinary productions that was ever exhibited to\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Papers received the 8th of March, 1788, and translated pursuant to\r\n     an Order of the Governor-General in Council, dated the 21th of\r\n     April, 1788, under the Seal of His Excellency the Nabob Asoph ul\r\n     Dowlah, Asoph Jah Bahadur, Vizier ul Momalik._\r\n\r\n     \"I have at this time learnt that the gentlemen in power in England,\r\n     upon the suspicion that Mr. Hastings, during his administration,\r\n     acted contrary to the rules of justice and impartiality, and,\r\n     actuated by motives of avidity, was inimical towards men without\r\n     cause; that he broke such engagements and treaties as had been made\r\n     between the Company and other chiefs; that he extended the hand of\r\n     oppression over the properties of men, tore up the roots of\r\n     security and prosperity from the land, and rendered the ryots and\r\n     subjects destitute by force and extortion.--As this accusation, in\r\n     fact, is destitute of uprightness and void of truth, therefore,\r\n     with a view to show the truth in its true colors, I have written\r\n     upon this sheet with truth and sincerity, to serve as an evidence,\r\n     and to represent real facts,--to serve also as information and\r\n     communication, that Mr. Hastings, from the commencement of his\r\n     administration until his departure for England, whether during the\r\n     lifetime of the deceased Nabob, of blessed memory, Vizier ul Moolk,\r\n     Sujah ul Dowlah Bahadur, my father, or during my government, did\r\n     not at any time transact contrary to justice any matter which took\r\n     place from the great friendship between me and the Company, nor in\r\n     any business depart from the path of truth and uprightness, but\r\n     cultivated friendship with integrity and sincerity, and in every\r\n     respect engaged himself in the duties of friendship with me, my\r\n     ministers and confidants. I am at all times, and in every way,\r\n     pleased with and thankful for his friendly manners and qualities;\r\n     and my ministers and confidants, who have always, every one of\r\n     them, been satisfied with his conduct, are forever grateful for his\r\n     friendship and thankful for his virtues. As these matters are real\r\n     facts, and according to truth, I have written these lines as an\r\n     evidence, and transmit this paper to England, through the\r\n     government of Calcutta, for the information of the gentlemen of\r\n     power and rank in England.\"\r\n\r\nObserve, my Lords, the candor of the Commons. We produce this evidence,\r\nwhich accuses us, as Mr. Hastings does, of uttering everything that is\r\nfalse; we choose to bring our shame before the world, and to admit that\r\nthis man, on whose behalf and on the behalf of whose country we have\r\naccused Mr. Hastings, has declared that this accusation (namely, this\r\nimpeachment) is destitute of uprightness and without truth. But, my\r\nLords, this is not only a direct contradiction to all he has ever said,\r\nto all that has been proved to you by us, but a direct contradiction to\r\nall the representations of Mr. Hastings himself. Your Lordships will\r\nhence see what credit is to be given to these papers.\r\n\r\nYour Lordships shall now hear what Hyder Beg Khân says: that Hyder Beg\r\nKhân who stands recorded in your minutes as the worst of mankind; who is\r\nrepresented as writing letters without the Nabob's consent, and in\r\ndefiance of him; the man of whom Mr. Hastings says, that the Nabob is\r\nnothing but a tool in his hands, and that the Nabob is and ever must be\r\na tool of somebody or other. Now, as we have heard the tool speak, let\r\nus hear how the workman employed to work with this tool speaks.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Extract from Hyder Beg Khân's Letter to the Governor and Council._\r\n\r\n     \"It is at this time learnt by the Nabob Vizier, and us, his\r\n     ministers, that the gentlemen of power in England are displeased\r\n     with Mr. Hastings, on the suspicion that during his administration\r\n     in this country, from motives of avidity, he committed oppressions\r\n     contrary to the rules of justice, took the properties of men by\r\n     deceit and force, injured the ryots and subjects, and rendered the\r\n     country destitute and ruined. As the true and upright disposition\r\n     of Mr. Hastings is in every respect free of this suspicion, we\r\n     therefore with truth and sincerity declare by these lines, written\r\n     according to fact, that Mr. Hastings, from the first of his\r\n     appointment to the government of this country until his departure\r\n     for Europe, during his authority in the management of the affairs\r\n     of the country, whether in the lifetime of the Nabob Sujah ul\r\n     Dowlah Bahadur, deceased, or whether during the present reign, did\r\n     not, in any matters which took place from the great friendship\r\n     between this government and the Company, act in any wise upon\r\n     motives of avidity, and, not having, in any respect, other than\r\n     justice and propriety in intention, did not swerve from their\r\n     rules. He kept his Excellency the Vizier always pleased and\r\n     satisfied\" (you will remember, my Lords, the last expressions of\r\n     his pleasure and satisfaction) \"by his friendship and attention in\r\n     every matter. He at all times showed favor and kindness towards us,\r\n     the ministers of this government; and under his protection having\r\n     enjoyed perfect happiness and comfort, we are from our hearts\r\n     satisfied with and grateful for his benevolence and goodness.\"\r\n\r\nHere, my Lords, you have the character which Hyder Beg Khân gives of Mr.\r\nHastings,--of the man who he knew had loaded him, as he had done, with\r\nevery kind of indignity, reproach, and outrage with which a man can be\r\nloaded. Your Lordships will see that this testimony repeats, almost word\r\nfor word, the testimony of the Vizier Nabob,--which shows who the real\r\nwriter is.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, it is said, that there is no word in the Persian language to\r\nexpress gratitude. With these signal instances of gratitude before us, I\r\nthink we may venture to put one into their dictionary. Mr. Hastings has\r\nsaid he has had the pleasure to find from the people of India that\r\ngratitude which he has not met with from his own countrymen, the House\r\nof Commons. Certainly, if he has done us services, we have been\r\nungrateful indeed; if he has committed enormous crimes, we are just. Of\r\nthe miserable, dependent situation to which these people are reduced,\r\nthat they are not ashamed to come forward and deny everything they have\r\ngiven under their own hand,--all these things show the portentous nature\r\nof this government, they show the portentous nature of that phalanx with\r\nwhich the House of Commons is at present at war, the power of that\r\ncaptain-general of every species of Indian iniquity, which, under him,\r\nis embodied, arrayed, and paid, from Leadenhall Street to the\r\nfurthermost part of India.\r\n\r\nWe have but one observation more to offer upon this collection of\r\n_razinamas_, upon these miserable testimonials given by these wretched\r\npeople in contradiction to all their own previous\r\nrepresentations,--directly in contradiction to those of Mr. Hastings\r\nhimself,--directly in contradiction to those of Lord\r\nCornwallis,--directly in contradiction to truth itself. It is this. Here\r\nis Mr. Hastings with his agents canvassing the country, with all that\r\nminuteness with which a county is canvassed at an election; and yet in\r\nthis whole book of razinamas not one fact adduced by us is attempted to\r\nbe disproved, not one fact upon which Mr. Hastings's defence can be\r\nfounded is attempted to be proved. There is nothing but bare vile\r\npanegyrics, directly belied by the state of facts, directly belied by\r\nthe persons themselves, directly belied by Mr. Hastings at your bar, and\r\nby all the whole course of the correspondence of the country.\r\n\r\nWe here leave to your Lordships' judgment the consideration of the\r\nelevated rank of the persons aggrieved and degraded to the lowest state\r\nof dependence and actual distress,--the consideration of the condition\r\nof the country gentlemen, who were obliged to hide their heads, wherever\r\nthey could, from the plunderers and robbers established under his\r\nauthority in every part of the country, and that of the miserable common\r\npeople, who have been obliged to sell their children through want of\r\nfood to feed them,--the consideration, I say, of the manner in which\r\nthis country, in the highest, in the middle, and in the lowest classes\r\nof its inhabitants, nay, in physical works of God, was desolated and\r\ndestroyed by this man.\r\n\r\nHaving now done with the province of Oude, we will proceed to the\r\nprovince of Bengal, and consider what was the kind of government which\r\nhe exercised there, and in what manner it affected the people that were\r\nsubjected to it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBengal, like every part of India subject to the British empire, contains\r\n(as I have already had occasion to mention) three distinct classes of\r\npeople, forming three distinct social systems. The first is the\r\nMahometans, which, about seven hundred years ago, obtained a footing in\r\nthat country, and ever since has in a great degree retained its\r\nauthority there. For the Mahometans had settled there long before the\r\nfoundation of the Bengal empire, which was overturned by Tamerlane: so\r\nthat this people, who are represented sometimes loosely as strangers,\r\nare people of ancient and considerable settlement in that country; and\r\nthough, like Mahometan settlers in many other countries, they have\r\nfallen into decay, yet, being continually recruited from various parts\r\nof Tartary under the Mogul empire, and from various parts of Persia,\r\nthey continue to be the leading and most powerful people throughout the\r\npeninsula; and so we found them there. These people, for the most part,\r\nfollow no trades or occupation, their religion and laws forbidding them\r\nin the strictest manner to take usury or profit arising from money that\r\nis in any way lent; they have, therefore, no other means for their\r\nsupport but what arises from their adherence to and connection with the\r\nMogul government and its viceroys. They enjoy under them various\r\noffices, civil and military,--various employments in the courts of law,\r\nand stations in the army. Accordingly a prodigious number of people,\r\nalmost all of them persons of the most ancient and respectable families\r\nin the country, are dependent upon and cling to the subahdars or\r\nviceroys of the several provinces. They, therefore, who oppress,\r\nplunder, and destroy the subahdars, oppress, rob, and destroy an immense\r\nmass of people. It is true that a supervening government, established\r\nupon another, always reduces a certain portion of the dependants upon\r\nthe latter to want. You must distress, by the very nature of the\r\ncircumstances of the case, a great number of people; but then it is your\r\nbusiness, when, by the superiority which you have acquired, however you\r\nmay have acquired it, (for I am not now considering whether you have\r\nacquired it by fraud or force, or whether by a mixture of both,) when, I\r\nsay, you have acquired it, it is your business not to oppress those\r\npeople with new and additional difficulties, but rather to console them\r\nin the state to which they are reduced, and to give them all the\r\nassistance and protection in your power.\r\n\r\nThe next system is composed of the descendants of the people who were\r\nfound in the country by the Mahometan invaders. The system before\r\nmentioned comprehends the official interest, the judicial interest, the\r\ncourt interest, and the military interest. This latter body includes\r\nalmost the whole landed interest, commercial interest, and moneyed\r\ninterest of the country. For the Hindoos not being forbidden by their\r\nlaws or religious tenets, as laid down in the Shaster, many of them\r\nbecame the principal money-lenders and bankers; and thus the Hindoos\r\nform the greatest part both of the landed and moneyed interest in that\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe third and last system is formed of the English interest; which in\r\nreality, whether it appears directly or indirectly, is the governing\r\ninterest of the whole country,--of its civil and military interest, of\r\nits landed, moneyed, and revenue interest; and what to us is the\r\ngreatest concern of all, it is this system which is responsible for the\r\ngovernment of that country to the government of Great Britain. It is\r\ndivided into two parts: one emanating from the Company, and afterwards\r\nregulated by act of Parliament; the other a judicial body, sent out by\r\nand acting under the authority of the crown itself. The persons\r\ncomposing that interest are those whom we usually call the servants of\r\nthe Company. They enter into that service, as your Lordships know, at an\r\nearly period of life, and they are promoted accordingly as their merit\r\nor their interest may provide for them. This body of men, with respect\r\nto its number, is so small as scarcely to deserve mentioning; but, from\r\ncertain circumstances, the government of the whole country is fallen\r\ninto their hands. Amongst these circumstances, the most important and\r\nessential are their having the public revenues and the public purse\r\nentirely in their own hands, and their having an army maintained by that\r\npurse, and disciplined in the European manner.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of that country when Mr. Hastings was appointed\r\nGovernor in 1772. Your Lordships are now to decide upon the manner in\r\nwhich he has comported himself with regard to all these three interests:\r\nfirst, whether he has made the ancient Mahometan families as easy as he\r\ncould; secondly, whether he has made the Hindoo inhabitants, the\r\nzemindars and their tenants, as secure in their property and as easy in\r\ntheir tenure as he could; and lastly, whether he has made the English\r\ninterest a blessing to the country, and, whilst it provided moderate,\r\nsafe, and proper emoluments to the persons that were concerned in it, it\r\nkept them from oppression and rapine, and a general waste and ravage of\r\nthe country: whether, in short, he made all these three interests pursue\r\nthat one object which all interests and all governments ought to pursue,\r\nthe advantage and welfare of the people under them.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, in support of our charge against the prisoner at your bar,\r\nthat he acted in a manner directly the reverse of this, we have proved\r\nto you that his first acts of oppression were directed against the\r\nMahometan government,--that government which had been before, not only\r\nin name, but in effect, to the very time of his appointment, the real\r\ngovernment of the country. After the Company had acquired its right over\r\nit, some shadow still remained of the ancient government. An allowance\r\nwas settled for the Nabob of Bengal, to support the dignity of his\r\ncourt, which amounted to between four and five hundred thousand pounds a\r\nyear. In this was comprehended the support of the whole mass of\r\nnobility,--the soldiers, serving or retired,--all the officers of the\r\ncourt, and all the women that were dependent upon them,--the whole of\r\nthe criminal jurisdiction of the country, and a very considerable part\r\nof the civil law and the civil government. These establishments formed\r\nthe constitutional basis of their political government.\r\n\r\nThe Company never had (and it is a thing that we can never too often\r\nrepeat to your Lordships)--the Company never had of right despotic power\r\nin that country, to overturn any of these establishments. The Mogul, who\r\ngave them their charters, could not give them such a power,--he did not\r\n_de facto_ give them such a power; the government of this country did\r\nnot by act of Parliament, and the Company did not and could not by their\r\ndelegation, give him such a power; the act by which he was appointed\r\nGovernor did not give him such a power. If he exercised it, he usurped\r\nit; and therefore, every step we take in the examination of his conduct\r\nin Bengal, as in every step we take upon the same subject everywhere\r\nelse, we look for the justification of his conduct to laws,--the Law of\r\nNations, the laws of this country, and the laws of the country he was\r\nsent to govern.\r\n\r\nThe government of that country, by the ancient constitution of the Mogul\r\nempire, besides the numberless individual checks and counter-checks in\r\nthe inferior officers [offices?], is divided into the viceroyal part and\r\nthe subahdarry part. The viceroyal part takes in all criminal justice\r\nand political government. Mr. Hastings found the country under a\r\nviceroy, governing according to law, acting by proper judges and\r\nmagistrates under him: he himself not being the judicial, but executive\r\npower of the country,--that which sets the other in action, and does not\r\nsupersede it or supply its place. The other, the subahdarry power, which\r\nwas by the grant of the dewanny conferred upon the Company, had under\r\nits care the revenues, as much of the civil government as is concerned\r\nwith the revenues, and many other matters growing out of it. These two\r\noffices are coördinate and dependent on each other. The Company, after\r\ncontracting to maintain the army out of it, got the whole revenue into\r\ntheir power. The army being thus within their power, the subahdar by\r\ndegrees vanished into an empty name.\r\n\r\nWhen we thus undertook the government of the country, conscious that we\r\nhad undertaken a task which by any personal exertion of our own we were\r\nunable to perform in any proper or rational way, the Company appointed a\r\nnative of the country, Mahomed Reza Khân, who stands upon the records of\r\nthe Company, I venture to say, with such a character as no man perhaps\r\never did stand, to execute the duties of both offices. Upon the\r\nexpulsion of Cossim Ali Khân, the Nabob of Bengal, all his children were\r\nleft in a young, feeble, and unprotected state; and in that state of\r\nthings, Lord Clive, Mr. Sumner, who sits near Mr. Hastings, and the rest\r\nof the Council, wisely appointed Mahomed Reza Khân to fulfil the two\r\noffices of deputy-viceroy and deputy-dewan, for which he had immense\r\nallowances, and great jaghires and revenues, I allow. He was a man of\r\nthat dignity, rank, and consideration, added to his knowledge of law and\r\nexperience in business, that Lord Clive and Mr. Sumner, who examined\r\nstrictly his conduct at that time, did not think that 112,000_l._ a\r\nyear, the amount of the emoluments which had been allowed him, was a\r\ngreat deal too much; but at his own desire, and in order that these\r\nemoluments might be brought to stated and fixed sums, they reduced it to\r\n90,000_l._,--an allowance which they thought was not more than\r\nsufficient to preserve the state of so great a magistrate, and a man of\r\nsuch rank, exercising such great employments. The whole revenue of the\r\nCompany depended upon his talents and fidelity; and you will find, that,\r\non the day in which he surrendered the revenues into our hands, the\r\ndewanny, under his management, was a million more than it produced on\r\nthe day Mr. Hastings left it. For the truth of this I refer your\r\nLordships to a letter of the Company sent to the Board of Control. This\r\nletter is not in evidence before your Lordships, and what I am stating\r\nis merely historical. But I state the facts, and with the power of\r\nreferring for their proof to documents as authentic as if they were\r\nabsolutely in evidence before you. Assuming, therefore, that all these\r\nfacts may be verified by the records of the Company, I have now to state\r\nthat this man, by some rumors true or false, was supposed to have\r\nmisconducted himself in a time of great calamity in that country. A\r\ngreat famine had about this time grievously afflicted the whole province\r\nof Bengal.--I must remark by the way, that these countries are liable to\r\nthis calamity; but it is greatly blessed by Nature with resources which\r\nafford the means of speedy recovery, if their government does not\r\ncounteract them. Nature, that inflicts the calamity, soon heals the\r\nwound; it is in ordinary seasons the most fertile country, inhabited by\r\nthe most industrious people, and the most disposed to marriage and\r\nsettlement, probably, that exists in the whole world; so that population\r\nand fertility are soon restored, and the inhabitants quickly resume\r\ntheir former industrious occupations.\r\n\r\nDuring the agitation excited in the country by the calamity I have just\r\nmentioned, Mahomed Reza Khân, through the intrigues of Rajah Nundcomar,\r\none of his political rivals, and of some English faction that supported\r\nhim, was accused of being one of the causes of the famine. In answer to\r\nthis charge, he alleged, what was certainly a sufficient justification,\r\nthat he had acted under the direction of the English board, to which his\r\nconduct throughout this business was fully known. The Company, however,\r\nsent an order from England to have him tried; but though he frequently\r\nsupplicated the government at Calcutta that his trial should be\r\nproceeded in, in order that he might be either acquitted and discharged\r\nor condemned, Mr. Hastings kept him in prison two years, under pretence\r\n(as he wrote word to the Directors) that Mahomed Reza Khân himself was\r\nnot very desirous to hasten the matter. In the mean time the Court of\r\nDirectors, having removed him from his great offices, authorized and\r\ncommanded Mr. Hastings (and here we come within the sphere of your\r\nminutes) to appoint a successor to Mahomed Reza Khân, fit to fulfil the\r\nduties of his station. Now I shall first show your Lordships what sort\r\nof person the Court of Directors described to him as most fit to fill\r\nthe office of Mahomed Reza Khân, what sort of person he did appoint, and\r\nthen we will trace out to you the consequences of that appointment.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Letter from the Court of Directors to the President and Council at\r\n     Fort William, dated 28th August, 1771._\r\n\r\n     \"Though we have not a doubt but that, by the exertion of your\r\n     abilities, and the care and assiduity of our servants in the\r\n     superintendency of the revenues, the collections will be conducted\r\n     with more advantage to the Company and ease to the natives than by\r\n     means of a naib dewan, we are fully sensible of the expediency of\r\n     supporting some ostensible minister in the Company's interest at\r\n     the Nabob's court, to transact the political affairs of the sircar,\r\n     and interpose between the Company and the subjects of any European\r\n     power, in all cases wherein they may thwart our interest or\r\n     encroach on our authority; and as Mahomed Reza Khân can no longer\r\n     be considered by us as one to whom such a power can be safely\r\n     committed, we trust to your local knowledge the selection of some\r\n     person well qualified for the affairs of government, and of whose\r\n     attachment to the Company you shall be well assured: such person\r\n     you will recommend to the Nabob to succeed Mahomed Reza as minister\r\n     of the government, and guardian of the Nabob's minority; and we\r\n     persuade ourselves that the Nabob will pay such regard to your\r\n     recommendation as to invest him with the necessary power and\r\n     authority.\r\n\r\n     \"As the advantages which the Company may receive from the\r\n     appointment of such minister will depend on his readiness to\r\n     promote our views and advance our interest, we are willing to allow\r\n     him so liberal a gratification as may excite his zeal and secure\r\n     his attachment to the Company; we therefore empower you to grant to\r\n     the person whom you shall think worthy of this trust an annual\r\n     allowance not exceeding three lacs of rupees, (thirty thousand\r\n     pounds,) which we consider not only as a munificent reward for any\r\n     services he shall render the Company, but sufficient to enable him\r\n     to support his station with suitable rank and dignity. And here we\r\n     must add, that, in the choice you shall make of a person to be the\r\n     active minister of the Nabob's government, we hope and trust that\r\n     you will show yourselves worthy of the confidence we have placed in\r\n     you, by being actuated therein, by no other motives than those of\r\n     the public good and the safety and interest of the Company.\"\r\n\r\nHere, my Lords, a person was to be named fit to fill the office and\r\nsupply the place of Mahomed Reza Khân, who was deputy-viceroy of Bengal,\r\nat the head of the criminal justice of the country, and, in short, at\r\nthe head of the whole ostensible Mahometan government; he was also to\r\nsupply the place of Mahomed Reza Khân as naib dewan, from which Reza\r\nKhân was to be removed: for you will observe, the Directors always speak\r\nof a man fit to perform all the duties of Mahomed Reza Khân; and amongst\r\nthese he was to be as the guardian of the Nabob's person, and the\r\nrepresentative of his authority and government.\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings, having received these orders from the Court of Directors,\r\ndid--what? He alleges in his defence, that no positive commands were\r\ngiven him. But a very sufficient description was given of the person who\r\nought to succeed Mahomed Reza Khân, in whom the Company had before\r\nrecognized all the necessary qualities; and they therefore desire him to\r\nname a similar person. But what does Mr. Hastings do in consequence of\r\nthis authority? He names no man at all. He searches into the seraglio of\r\nthe Nabob, and names a woman to be the viceroy of the province, to be\r\nthe head of the ostensible government, to be the guardian of the Nabob's\r\nperson, the conservator of his authority, and a proper representative of\r\nthe remaining majesty of that government.\r\n\r\nWell, my Lords, he searched the seraglio. When you have to take into\r\nconsideration the guardianship of a person of great dignity, there are\r\ntwo circumstances to be attended to: one, a faithful and affectionate\r\nguardianship of his person; and the other, a strong interest in his\r\nauthority, and the means of exercising that authority in a proper and\r\ncompetent manner. Mr. Hastings, when he was looking for a woman in the\r\nseraglio, (for he could find women only there,) must have found actually\r\nin authority there the Nabob's own mother: certainly a person who by\r\nnature was most fit to be his guardian; and there is no manner of doubt\r\nof her being sufficiently competent to that duty. Here, then, was a\r\nlegitimate wife of the Nabob Jaffier Ali Khân, a woman of rank and\r\ndistinction, fittest to take care of the person and interests, as far as\r\na woman could take care of them, of her own son. In this situation she\r\nhad been placed before, during the administration of Mahomed Reza Khân,\r\nby the direct orders of the Governor, Sir John Cartier. She had, I say,\r\nbeen put in possession of that trust which it was natural and proper to\r\ngive to such a woman. But what does Mr. Hastings do? He deposes this\r\nwoman. He strips her of her authority with which he found her invested\r\nunder the sanction of the English government. He finds out a woman in\r\nthe seraglio, called Munny Begum, who was bound to the Nabob by no tie\r\nwhatever of natural affection. He makes this woman the guardian of the\r\nyoung Nabob's person. She had a son who had been placed upon the musnud\r\nafter the death of his father, Sujah Dowlah, and had been appointed his\r\nguardian. This young Nabob died soon afterwards, and was succeeded by\r\nNujim ul Dowlah, another natural son of Sujah Dowlah. This prince being\r\nleft without a mother, this woman was suffered to retain the\r\nguardianship of the Nabob till his death. When Mobarek ul Dowlah, a\r\nlegitimate son of Sujah Dowlah, succeeded him, Sir John Cartier did what\r\nhis duty was: he put the Nabob's own mother into the place which she was\r\nnaturally entitled to hold, the guardianship of her own son, and\r\ndisplaced Munny Begum. The whole of the arrangement by which Munny Begum\r\nwas appointed guardian of the two preceding Nabobs stands in the\r\nCompany's records stigmatized as a transaction base, wicked, and\r\ncorrupt. We will read to your Lordships an extract from a letter which\r\nhas the signature of Mr. Sumner, the gentleman who sits here by the side\r\nof Mr. Hastings, and from which you will learn what the Company and the\r\nCouncil thought of the original nomination of Munny Begum and of her\r\nson. You will find that they considered her as a great agent and\r\ninstrument of all the corruption there; and that this whole transaction,\r\nby which the bastard son of Munny Begum was brought forward to the\r\nprejudice of the legitimate son of the Nabob, was considered to be, what\r\nit upon the very face of it speaks itself to be, corrupt and scandalous.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Extract of a General Letter from the President and Council at\r\n     Calcutta, Bengal, to the Select Committee of the Directors._\r\n\r\n     Paragraph 5.--\"At Fort St. George we received the first advices of\r\n     the demise of Mir Jaffier, and of Sujah Dowlah's defeat. It was\r\n     there firmly imagined that no definitive measures would be taken,\r\n     either with respect to a peace or filling the vacancy in the\r\n     nizamut, before our arrival,--as the 'Lapwing' arrived in the month\r\n     of January with your general letter, and the appointment of a\r\n     committee with express powers to that purpose, for the successful\r\n     exertion of which the happiest occasion now offered. However, a\r\n     contrary resolution prevailed in the Council. The opportunity of\r\n     acquiring immense fortunes was too inviting to be neglected, and\r\n     the temptation too powerful to be resisted. A treaty was hastily\r\n     drawn up by the board,--or rather, transcribed, with few\r\n     unimportant additions, from that concluded with Mir Jaffier,--and a\r\n     deputation, consisting of Messrs. Johnstone, senior, Middleton, and\r\n     Leycester, appointed to raise the natural son of the deceased Nabob\r\n     to the subahdarry, in prejudice of the claim of the grandson; and\r\n     for this measure such reasons assigned as ought to have dictated a\r\n     diametrically opposite resolution. Meeran's son was a minor, which\r\n     circumstance alone would have naturally brought the whole\r\n     administration into our hands at a juncture when it became\r\n     indispensably necessary we should realize the shadow of power and\r\n     influence, which, having no solid foundation, was exposed to the\r\n     danger of being annihilated by the first stroke of adverse fortune.\r\n     But this inconsistence was not regarded, nor was it material to the\r\n     views for precipitating the treaty, which was pressed on the young\r\n     Nabob at the first interview, in so earnest and indelicate a manner\r\n     as highly disgusted him and chagrined his ministers, while not a\r\n     single rupee was stipulated for the Company, whose interests were\r\n     sacrificed that their servants might revel in the spoils of a\r\n     treasury, before impoverished, but now totally exhausted.\r\n\r\n     \"6. This scene of corruption was first disclosed at a visit the\r\n     Nabob paid to Lord Clive and the gentlemen of the Committee a few\r\n     days after our arrival. He there delivered to his Lordship a letter\r\n     filled with bitter complaints of the insults and indignity he had\r\n     been exposed to, and the embezzlement of near twenty lacs of rupees\r\n     issued from his treasury for purposes unknown during the late\r\n     negotiations. So public a complaint could not be disregarded, and\r\n     it soon produced an inquiry. We referred the letter to the board in\r\n     expectation of obtaining a satisfactory account of the application\r\n     of this money, and were answered only by a warm remonstrance\r\n     entered by Mr. Leycester against that very Nabob in whose elevation\r\n     he boasts of having been a principal agent.\r\n\r\n     \"7. Mahomed Reza Khân, the naib subah, was then called upon to\r\n     account for this large disbursement from the treasury; and he soon\r\n     delivered to the Committee the very extraordinary narrative entered\r\n     in our Proceedings the 6th of June, wherein he specifies the\r\n     several names and sums, by whom paid, and to whom, whether in cash,\r\n     bills, or obligations. So precise, so accurate an account as this\r\n     of money for secret and venal services was never, we believe,\r\n     before this period, exhibited to the Honorable Court of Directors,\r\n     at least never vouched by undeniable testimony and authentic\r\n     documents: by Juggut Seet, who himself was obliged to contribute\r\n     largely to the sums demanded; by Muley Ram, who was employed by Mr.\r\n     Johnstone in all these pecuniary transactions; by the Nabob and\r\n     Mahomed Reza Khân, who were the heaviest sufferers; and, lastly, by\r\n     the confession of the gentlemen themselves whose names are\r\n     specified in the distribution list.\r\n\r\n     \"8. Juggut Seet expressly declared in his narrative, that the sum\r\n     which he agreed to pay the deputation, amounting to 125,000 rupees,\r\n     was extorted by menaces; and since the close of our inquiry, and\r\n     the opinions we delivered in the Proceedings of the 21st of June,\r\n     it fully appears that the presents from the Nabob and Mahomed Reza\r\n     Khân, exceeding the immense sum of seventeen lacs, were not the\r\n     voluntary offerings of gratitude, but contributions levied on the\r\n     weakness of the government, and violently exacted from the\r\n     dependent state and timid disposition of the minister. The charge,\r\n     indeed, is denied on the one hand, as well as affirmed on the\r\n     other. Your honorable board must therefore determine how far the\r\n     circumstance of extortion may aggravate the crime of disobedience\r\n     to your positive orders,--the exposing the government in a manner\r\n     to sale, and receiving the infamous wages of corruption from\r\n     opposite parties and contending interests. We speak with boldness,\r\n     because we speak from conviction founded upon indubitable evidence,\r\n     that, besides the above sums specified in the distribution account,\r\n     to the amount of 228,125_l._ sterling, there was likewise to the\r\n     value of several lacs of rupees procured from Nundcomar and Roy\r\n     Dullub, each of whom aspired at and obtained a promise of that very\r\n     employment it was predetermined to bestow on Mahomed Reza Khân.\r\n\r\n        (Signed at the end,)\r\n        \"CLIVE.\r\n        W^M B. SUMNER.\r\n        JOHN CARNAC.\r\n        H. VERELST.\r\n        FRA^S SYKES.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, the persons who sign this letter are mostly the friends, and\r\none of them is the gentleman who is bail for and sits near Mr. Hastings.\r\nThey state to you this horrible and venal transaction, by which the\r\ngovernment was set to sale, by which a bastard son was elevated to the\r\nwrong of the natural and legitimate heir, and in which a prostitute, his\r\nmother, was put in the place of the honorable and legitimate mother of\r\nthe representative of the family.\r\n\r\nNow, if there was one thing more than another under heaven, which Mr.\r\nHastings ought to have shunned, it was the suspicion of being concerned\r\nin any such infamous transaction as that which is here recorded to be\r\nso,--a transaction in which the country government had before been sold\r\nto this very woman and her offspring, and in which two great candidates\r\nfor power in that country fought against each other, and perhaps the\r\nlargest offerer carried it.\r\n\r\nWhen a Governor-General sees the traces of corruption in the conduct of\r\nhis predecessors, the traces of injustice following that corruption, the\r\ntraces of notorious irregularity in setting aside the just claimants in\r\nfavor of those that have no claim at all, he has that before his eyes\r\nwhich ought to have made him the more scrupulously avoid, and to keep at\r\nthe farthest distance possible from, the contagion and even the\r\nsuspicion of being corrupted by it. Moreover, my Lords, it was in\r\nconsequence of these very transactions that the new covenants were made,\r\nwhich bind the servants of the Company never to take a present of above\r\ntwo hundred pounds, or some such sum of money, from any native in\r\ncircumstances there described. This covenant I shall reserve for\r\nconsideration in another part of this business. It was in pursuance of\r\nthis idea, and to prevent the abuse of the prevailing custom of visiting\r\nthe governing powers of that country with a view of receiving presents\r\nfrom them, that the House of Commons afterwards, in its inquiries, took\r\nup this matter and passed the Regulating Act in 1773.\r\n\r\nBut to return to Munny Begum.--This very person, that had got into power\r\nby the means already mentioned, did Mr. Hastings resort to, knowing her\r\nto be well skilled in the trade of bribery,--knowing her skilful\r\npractice in business of this sort,--knowing the fitness of her eunuchs,\r\ninstruments, and agents, to be dealers in this kind of traffic. This\r\nvery woman did Mr. Hastings select, stigmatized as she was in the\r\nCompany's record, stigmatized by the very gentleman who sits next to\r\nhim, and whose name you have heard read to you as one of those members\r\nof the Council that reprobated the horrible iniquity of the transaction\r\nin which this woman was a principal agent. For though neither the young\r\nNabob nor his mother ought to have been raised to the stations in which\r\nthey were placed, and were placed there for the purpose of facilitating\r\nthe receipt of bribes, yet the order of Nature was preserved, and the\r\nmother was made the guardian of her own son: for though she was a\r\nprostitute and he a bastard, yet still she was a mother and he a son;\r\nand both Nature and legitimate disposition with regard to the\r\nguardianship of a son went together.\r\n\r\nBut what did Mr. Hastings do? Improving upon the preceding transaction,\r\nimproving on it by a kind of refinement in corruption, he drives away\r\nthe lawful mother from her lawful guardianship; the mother of nature he\r\nturns out, and he delivers her son to the stepmother to be the guardian\r\nof his person. That your Lordships may see who this woman was, we shall\r\nread to you a paper from your Lordships' minutes, produced before Mr.\r\nHastings's face, and never contradicted by him from that day to this.\r\n\r\n     At a Consultation, 24th July, 1775.--\"Shah Chanim, deceased, was\r\n     sister to the Nabob Mahub ul Jung by the same father, but different\r\n     mothers; she married Mir Mahomed Jaffier Khân, by whom she had a\r\n     son and a daughter; the name of the former was Mir Mahomed Sadduc\r\n     Ali Khân, and the latter was married to Mir Mahomed Cossim Khân\r\n     Sadduc. Ali Khân had two sons and two daughters; the sons' names\r\n     are Mir Sydoc and Mir Sobeem, who are now living; the daughters\r\n     were married to Sultan Mirza Daood.\r\n\r\n     \"Baboo Begum, the mother of the Nabob Mobarek ul Dowlah, was the\r\n     daughter of Summin Ali Khân, and married Mir Mahomed Jaffier Khân.\r\n     The history of Munny Begum is this. At a village called Balkonda,\r\n     near Sekundra, there lived a widow, who, from her great poverty,\r\n     not being able to bring up her daughter Munny, gave her to a slave\r\n     girl belonging to Summin Ali Khân, whose name was Bissoo. During\r\n     the space of five years she lived at Shahjehanabad, and was\r\n     educated by Bissoo after the manner of a dancing-girl. Afterwards\r\n     the Nabob Shamut Jung, upon the marriage of Ikram ul Dowlah,\r\n     brother to the Nabob Surajah ul Dowlah, sent for Bissoo Beg's set\r\n     of dancing-girls from Shahjehanabad, of which Munny Begum was one,\r\n     and allowed them ten thousand rupees for their expenses, to dance\r\n     at the wedding. While this ceremony was celebrating, they were kept\r\n     by the Nabob; but some months afterwards he dismissed them, and\r\n     they took up their residence in this city. Mir Mahomed Jaffier Khân\r\n     then took them into keeping, and allowed Munny and her set five\r\n     hundred rupees per month, till at length, finding that Munny was\r\n     pregnant, he took her into his own house. She gave birth to the\r\n     Nabob Nujim ul Dowlah, and in this manner she has remained in the\r\n     Nabob's family ever since.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, I do not mean to detain you long upon this part of the\r\nbusiness, but I have thought it necessary to advert to these\r\nparticulars. As to all the rest, the honorable and able Manager who\r\npreceded me has sufficiently impressed upon your Lordships' minds the\r\nmonstrous nature of the deposing of the Nabob's mother from the\r\nguardianship of her son, for the purpose of placing this woman there at\r\nthe head of all his family and of his domestic concerns in the seraglio\r\nwithin doors, and at the head of the state without, together with the\r\ndisposal of the whole of the revenue that was allowed him. Mr. Hastings\r\npretends, indeed, to have appointed at the same time a trusty mutsuddy\r\nto keep the accounts of the revenue; but he has since declared that no\r\naccount had been kept, and that it was in vain to desire it or to call\r\nfor it. This is the state of the case with respect to the appointment of\r\nMunny Begum.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the reappointment of Mahomed Reza Khân, you have heard\r\nfrom my worthy fellow Manager that he was acquitted of the charges that\r\nhad been brought against him by Mr. Hastings, after a long and lingering\r\ntrial. The Company was perfectly satisfied with the acquittal, and\r\ndeclared that he was not only acquitted, but honorably acquitted; and\r\nthey also declared that he had a fair claim to a compensation for his\r\nsufferings. They not only declared him innocent, but meritorious. They\r\ngave orders that he should be considered as a person who was to be\r\nplaced in office again upon the first occasion, and that he had entitled\r\nhimself to this favor by his conduct in the place which he had before\r\nfilled.\r\n\r\nThe Council of the year 1775, (whom I can never mention nor shall\r\nmention without honor,) who complied faithfully with the act of\r\nParliament, who never disobeyed the orders of the Company, and to whom\r\nno man has imputed even the shadow of corruption, found that this Munny\r\nBegum had acted in the manner which my honorable fellow Manager has\r\nstated: that she had dissipated the revenue, that she had neglected the\r\neducation of the Nabob, and had thrown the whole judicature of the\r\ncountry into confusion. They ordered that she should be removed from her\r\nsituation; that the Nabob's own mother should be placed at the head of\r\nthe seraglio, a situation to which she was entitled; and with regard to\r\nthe rest of the offices, that Mahomed Reza Khân should be employed to\r\nfill them.\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings resisted these propositions with all his might; but they\r\nwere by that happy momentary majority carried against him, and Mahomed\r\nReza Khân was placed in his former situation. But Mr. Hastings, though\r\nthus defeated, was only waiting for what he considered to be the\r\nfortunate moment for returning again to his corrupt, vicious,\r\ntyrannical, and disobedient habits. The reappointment of Mahomed Reza\r\nKhân had met with the fullest approbation of the Company; and they\r\ndirected, that, as long as his good behavior entitled him to it, he\r\nshould continue in the office. Mr. Hastings, however, without alleging\r\nany ill behavior, and for no reason that can be assigned, but his\r\ncorrupt engagement with Munny Begum, overturned (upon the pretence of\r\nrestoring the Nabob to his rights) the whole of the Company's\r\narrangement, as settled by the late majority, and approved by the Court\r\nof Directors.\r\n\r\nI have now to show you what sort of a man the Nabob was, who was thus\r\nset up in defiance of the Company's authority; what Mr. Hastings himself\r\nthought of him; what the judges thought of him; and what all the world\r\nthought of him.\r\n\r\nI must first make your Lordships acquainted with a little preliminary\r\nmatter. A man named Roy Rada Churn had been appointed vakeel, or agent,\r\nto manage the Nabob's affairs at Calcutta. One of this man's creditors\r\nattached him there. Roy Rada Churn pleaded his privilege as the vakeel\r\nor representative of a sovereign prince. The question came to be tried\r\nin the Supreme Court, and the issue was, Whether the Nabob was a\r\nsovereign prince or not. I think the court did exceedingly wrong in\r\nentertaining such a question; because, in my opinion, whether he was or\r\nwas not a sovereign prince, any person representing him ought to be left\r\nfree, and to have a proper and secure means of concerting his affairs\r\nwith the Council. It was, however, taken otherwise; the question was\r\nbrought to trial, whether the Nabob was a sovereign prince sufficient to\r\nappoint and protect a person to manage his affairs, under the name of an\r\nambassador. In that cause did Mr. Hastings come forward to prove, by a\r\nvoluntary affidavit, that he had no pretensions, no power, no authority\r\nat all,--that he was a mere pageant, a thing of straw,--and that the\r\nCompany exercised every species of authority over him, in every\r\nparticular, and in every respect; and that, therefore, to talk of him as\r\nan efficient person was an affront to the common sense of mankind: and\r\nthis you will find the judges afterwards declared to be their opinion.\r\n\r\nI will here press again one remark, which perhaps you may recollect that\r\nI have made before, that the chief and most usual mode in which all the\r\nvillanies perpetrated in India, by Mr. Hastings and his co-partners in\r\niniquity, has been through the medium and instrumentality of persons\r\nwhom they pretended to have rights of their own, and to be acting for\r\nthemselves; whereas such persons were, in fact, totally dependent upon\r\nhim, Mr. Hastings, and did no one act that was not prescribed by him.\r\nIn order, therefore, to let you see the utter falsehood, fraud,\r\nprevarication, and deceit of the pretences by which the native powers of\r\nIndia are represented to be independent, and are held up as the\r\ninstruments of defying the laws of this kingdom, under pretext of their\r\nbeing absolute princes, I will read the affidavit of Warren Hastings,\r\nEsquire, Governor-General of Bengal, made the 31st July, 1775.\r\n\r\n     \"This deponent maketh oath, and saith, That the late President and\r\n     Council did, in or about the month of August, 1772, by their own\r\n     authority appoint Munny Begum, relict of the late Nabob, Mir\r\n     Jaffier Ali Khân, to be guardian to the present Nabob, Mobarek ul\r\n     Dowlah, and Rajah Gourdas, son of Maha Rajah Nundcomar, to be dewan\r\n     of the said Nabob's household, allowing to the said Munny Begum a\r\n     salary of 140,000 rupees per annum, and to the said Rajah Gourdas,\r\n     for himself and officers, a salary of 100,000 rupees per annum:\r\n     That the said late President and Council did, in or about the month\r\n     of August, 1772, plan and constitute regular and distinct courts of\r\n     justice, civil and criminal, by their own authority, for\r\n     administration of justice to the inhabitants throughout Bengal,\r\n     without consulting the said Nabob or requiring his concurrence, and\r\n     that the said civil courts were made solely dependent on the\r\n     Presidency of Calcutta; and the said criminal courts were put under\r\n     the inspection and control of the Company's servants, although\r\n     ostensibly under the name of the Nazim, as appears from the\r\n     following extracts from the plan for the administration of justice,\r\n     constituted by the President and Council as aforesaid.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, we need not go through all the circumstances of this\r\naffidavit, which is in your minutes, and, to save time, I will refer\r\nyour Lordships to them. This affidavit, as I have already said, was put\r\ninto the court to prove that the Nabob had no power or authority at all;\r\nbut what is very singular in it, and which I recommend to the particular\r\nnotice of your Lordships, when you are scrutinizing this matter, is,\r\nthat there is not a single point stated, to prove the nullity of this\r\nNabob's authority, that was not Mr. Hastings's on particular act. Well,\r\nthe Governor-General swears; the judge of the court refers to him in his\r\ndecision; he builds and bottoms it upon the Governor-General's\r\naffidavit;--he swears, I say, that the Council, by their own authority,\r\nappointed Munny Begum to be guardian to the Nabob.\r\n\r\n\"By what authority,\" the Governor-General asks, \"did the Council erect\r\ncourts of law and superintend the administration of justice, without any\r\ncommunication with the Nabob? Had the Nabob himself any idea that he was\r\na sovereign? Does he complain of the reduction of his stipend or the\r\ninfringement of treaties? No; he appears to consider himself to be, what\r\nin fact he really is, absolutely dependent on the Company, and to be\r\nwilling to accept any pittance they would allow him for his maintenance:\r\nhe claims no rights. Does he complain that the administration of justice\r\nis taken into the hands of the Company? No: by the treaty, the\r\nprotection of his subjects is delivered up to the Company; and he well\r\nknew, that, whoever may be held up as the ostensible prince, the\r\nadministration of justice must be in the hands of those who have power\r\nto enforce it.\" He goes on,--\"The Governor-General, who, I suppose, had\r\na delicacy to state more than what had before been made public, closes\r\nhis affidavit with saying that all he has deposed to he believes to be\r\npublicly known, as it is particularly set forth in the printed book\r\nentitled 'Reports of the Committee of the House of Commons.' I knew,\" he\r\nadds, \"it was there, and was therefore surprised at this application; it\r\nis so notorious, that everybody in the settlement must have known it:\r\nwhen I say everybody, I mean with an exception to the gentlemen who have\r\napplied to the court. The only reason I can give for their applying is\r\nthe little time they have been in the country.\" The judge (I think it is\r\nChief-Justice Impey) then goes on,--\"Perhaps this question might have\r\nbeen determined merely on the dates of the letters to the\r\nGovernor-General; but as the Council have made the other a serious\r\nquestion, I should not have thought that I had done my duty, if I had\r\nnot given a full and determinate opinion upon it: I should have been\r\nsorry, if I had left it doubtful whether the empty name of a Nabob\r\nshould be thrust between a delinquent and the laws, so as effectually to\r\nprotect him from the hand of justice.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, the court, as you see, bottoms its determination on what we\r\nstand upon here, Mr. Hastings's evidence, that the empty name of a\r\npretended sovereign should not be thrust forth between a delinquent and\r\njustice.\r\n\r\nWhat does Mr. Le Maistre, the other judge, say upon this occasion? \"With\r\nregard to this phantom, that man of straw, Mobarek ul Dowlah, it is an\r\ninsult on the understanding of the court to have made the question of\r\nhis sovereignty. But as it came from the Governor-General and Council, I\r\nhave too much respect for that body to treat it ludicrously, and I\r\nconfess I cannot consider it seriously, and we always shall consider a\r\nletter of business from the Nabob the same as a letter from the\r\nGovernor-General and Council.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the unanimous opinion of all the judges concerning the state and\r\ncondition of the Nabob. We have thus established the point we mean to\r\nestablish: that any use which shall be made of the Nabob's name for the\r\npurpose of justifying any disobedience to the orders of the Company, or\r\nof bringing forward corrupt and unfit persons for the government, could\r\nbe considered as no other than the act of the persons who shall make\r\nsuch a use of it; and that no letter that the Nabob writes to any one in\r\npower was or could be considered as any other than the letter of that\r\nperson himself. This we wish to impress upon your Lordships, because, as\r\nyou have before seen the use that has been made in this way of the Nabob\r\nof Oude, you may judge of the use that has been made of the name of\r\nHyder Beg Khân, and of the names of all the eminent persons of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nOne word more and I have done. If, whilst you remark the use that is\r\nmade of this man's name, your Lordships shall find that this use has\r\never been made of his name for his benefit, or for the purpose of giving\r\nhim any useful or substantial authority, or of meliorating his condition\r\nin any way whatever; forgive the fraud, forgive the disobedience. But if\r\nwe have shown your Lordships that it was for no other purpose than to\r\ndisobey the orders of the Company, to trample upon the laws of his\r\ncountry, to introduce back again, and to force into power, those very\r\ncorrupt and wicked instruments which had formerly done so much\r\nmischief, and for which mischief they were removed, then we shall not\r\nhave passed our time in vain, in endeavoring to prove that this man, in\r\nthe opinion of a court of justice, and by public notoriety, and by Mr.\r\nHastings's own opinion, was held to be fit for nothing but to be made a\r\ntool in his hands.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHaving stated to your Lordships generally the effects produced upon the\r\nMahometan interest of Bengal by the misconduct of the prisoner at your\r\nbar with respect to the appointment of the guardian of the Nabob or\r\nSubahdar of that province, and of the ministers of his government, I\r\nshall have the honor of attending your Lordships another day, and shall\r\nshow you the use that has been made of this government and of the\r\nauthority of the Nabob, who, as your Lordships have seen, was the mere\r\nphantom of power; and I shall show how much a phantom he was for every\r\ngood purpose, and how effectual an instrument he was made for every bad\r\none.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH\r\n\r\nIN\r\n\r\nGENERAL REPLY.\r\n\r\nEIGHTH DAY: SATURDAY, JUNE 14, 1794\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Lords,--Your Lordships heard, upon the last day of the meeting of\r\nthis high court, the distribution of the several matters which I should\r\nhave occasion to lay before you, and by which I resolved to guide\r\nmyself in the examination of the conduct of Mr. Hastings with regard to\r\nBengal. I stated that I should first show the manner in which he\r\ncomported himself with regard to the people who were found in possession\r\nof the government when we first entered into Bengal. We have shown to\r\nyour Lordships the progressive steps by which the native government was\r\nbrought into a state of annihilation. We have stated the manner in which\r\nthat government was solemnly declared by a court of justice to be\r\ndepraved, and incompetent to act, and dead in law. We have shown to your\r\nLordships (and we have referred you to the document) that its death was\r\ndeclared upon a certificate of the principal attending physician of the\r\nstate, namely, Mr. Warren Hastings himself. This was declared in an\r\naffidavit made by him, wherein he has gone through all the powers of\r\ngovernment, of which he had regularly despoiled the Nabob Mobarek ul\r\nDowlah, part by part, exactly according to the ancient formula by which\r\na degraded knight was despoiled of his knighthood: they took, I say,\r\nfrom him all the powers of government, article by article,--his helmet,\r\nhis shield, his cuirass; at last they hacked off his spurs, and left him\r\nnothing. Mr. Hastings laid down all the premises, and left the judges to\r\ndraw the conclusion.\r\n\r\nYour Lordships will remark (for you will find it on your minutes) that\r\nthe judges have declared this affidavit of Mr. Hastings to be a\r\n_delicate_ affidavit. We have heard of affidavits that were true; we\r\nhave heard of affidavits that were perjured; but this is the first\r\ninstance that has come to our knowledge (and we receive it as a proof of\r\nIndian refinement) of a delicate affidavit. This affidavit of Mr.\r\nHastings we shall show to your Lordships is not entitled to the\r\ndescription of a good affidavit, however it might be entitled, in the\r\nopinion of those judges, to the description of a delicate affidavit,--a\r\nphrase by which they appear to have meant that he had furnished all the\r\nproofs of the Nabob's deposition, but had delicately avoided to declare\r\nhim expressly deposed. The judges drew, however, this indelicate\r\nconclusion; the conclusion they drew was founded upon the premises; it\r\nwas very just and logical; for they declared that he was a mere cipher.\r\nThey commended Mr. Hastings's delicacy, though they did not imitate it;\r\nbut they pronounced sentence of deposition upon the said Nabob, and they\r\ndeclared that any letter or paper that was produced from him could not\r\nbe considered as an act of government. So effectually was he removed by\r\nthe judges out of the way, that no minority, no insanity, no physical\r\ncircumstances, not even death itself, could put a man more completely\r\nout of sight. They declare that they would consider his letters in no\r\nother light than as the letters of the Company, represented by the\r\nGovernor-General and Council. Thus, then, we find the Nabob legally\r\ndead.\r\n\r\nWe find next, that he was politically dead. Mr. Hastings, not satisfied\r\nwith the affidavit he made in court, has thought proper upon record to\r\ninform the Company and the world of what he considered him to be civilly\r\nand politically.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Minute entered by the Governor-General._\r\n\r\n     \"_The Governor-General._--I object to this motion,\" (a motion\r\n     relative to the trial above alluded to,) \"because I do not\r\n     apprehend that the declaration of the judges respecting the Nabob's\r\n     sovereignty will involve this government in any difficulties with\r\n     the French or other foreign nations.\" (Mark, my Lords, these\r\n     political effects.) \"How little the screen of the Nabob's name has\r\n     hitherto availed will appear in the frequent and inconclusive\r\n     correspondence which has been maintained with the foreign\r\n     settlements, the French especially, since the Company have thought\r\n     proper to stand forth in their real character in the exercise of\r\n     the dewanny. From that period the government of these provinces has\r\n     been wholly theirs; nor can all the subtleties and distinctions of\r\n     political sophistry conceal the possession of power, where the\r\n     exercise of it is openly practised and universally felt in its\r\n     operation. In deference to the commands of the Company, we have\r\n     generally endeavored, in all our correspondence with foreigners, to\r\n     evade the direct avowal of our possessing the actual rule of the\r\n     country,--employing the unapplied term government, for the power to\r\n     which we exacted their submission; but I do not remember any\r\n     instance, and I hope none will be found, of our having been so\r\n     disingenuous as to disclaim our own power, or to affirm that the\r\n     Nabob was the real sovereign of these provinces. In effect, I do\r\n     not hesitate to say that I look upon this state of indecision to\r\n     have been productive of all the embarrassments which we have\r\n     experienced with the foreign settlements. None of them have ever\r\n     owned any dominion but that of the British government in these\r\n     provinces. Mr. Chevalier has repeatedly declared, that he will not\r\n     acknowledge any other, but will look to that only for the support\r\n     of the privileges possessed by his nation, and shall protest\r\n     against that alone as responsible for any act of power by which\r\n     their privileges may be violated or their property disturbed. The\r\n     Dutch, the Danes, have severally applied to this government, as to\r\n     the ruling power, for the grant of indulgences and the redress of\r\n     their grievances. In our replies to all, we have constantly assumed\r\n     the prerogatives of that character, but eluded the direct avowal of\r\n     it; under the name of influence we have offered them protection,\r\n     and we have granted them the indulgences of government under\r\n     elusive expressions, sometimes applied to our treaties with the\r\n     Nabobs, sometimes to our own rights as the dewan; sometimes openly\r\n     declaring the virtual rule which we held of these provinces, we\r\n     have contended with them for the rights of government, and\r\n     threatened to repel with force the encroachments on it; we in one\r\n     or two instances have actually put these threats into execution, by\r\n     orders directly issued to the officers of government and enforced\r\n     by detachments from our own military forces; the Nabob was never\r\n     consulted, nor was the pretence ever made that his orders or\r\n     concurrence were necessary: in a word, we have always allowed\r\n     ourselves to be treated as principals, we have treated as\r\n     principals, but we have contented ourselves with letting our\r\n     actions insinuate the character which we effectually possessed,\r\n     without asserting it.\r\n\r\n     \"For my own part, I have ever considered the reserve which has been\r\n     enjoined us in this respect as a consequence of the doubts which\r\n     have long prevailed, and which are still suffered to subsist,\r\n     respecting the rights of the British government and the Company to\r\n     the property and dominion of these provinces, not as inferring a\r\n     doubt with respect to any foreign power. It has, however, been\r\n     productive of great inconveniences; it has prevented our acting\r\n     with vigor in our disputes with the Dutch and French. The former\r\n     refuse to this day the payment of the _bahor peshcush_, although\r\n     the right is incontestably against them, and we have threatened to\r\n     enforce it. Both nations refuse to be bound by our decrees, or to\r\n     submit to our regulations; they refuse to submit to the payment of\r\n     the duties on the foreign commerce but in their own way, which\r\n     amounts almost to a total exemption; they refuse to submit to the\r\n     duty of ten per cent which is levied upon foreign salt, by which,\r\n     unless a stop can be put to it by a more decisive rule, they will\r\n     draw the whole of that important trade into their own colonies; and\r\n     even in the single instance in which they have allowed us to\r\n     prescribe to them, namely, the embargo on grain, on the\r\n     apprehension of a dearth, I am generally persuaded that they\r\n     acquiesced from the secret design of taking advantage of the\r\n     general suspension, by exporting grain clandestinely under cover of\r\n     their colors, which they knew would screen them from the rigorous\r\n     examination of our officers. We are precluded from forming many\r\n     arrangements of general utility, because of the want of control\r\n     over the European settlements; and a great part of the defects\r\n     which subsist in the government and commercial state of the country\r\n     are ultimately derived from this source. I have not the slightest\r\n     suspicion that a more open and decided conduct would expose us to\r\n     worse consequences from the European nations; on the contrary, we\r\n     have the worst of the argument while we contend with them under\r\n     false colors, while they know us under the disguise, and we have\r\n     not the confidence to disown it. What we have done and may do under\r\n     an assumed character is full as likely to involve us in a war with\r\n     France, a nation not much influenced by logical weapons, (if such\r\n     can be supposed to be the likely consequence of our own trifling\r\n     disagreements with them,) as if we stood forth their avowed\r\n     opponents. To conclude, instead of regretting, with Mr. Francis,\r\n     the occasion which deprives us of so useless and hurtful a\r\n     disguise, I should rather rejoice, were it really the case, and\r\n     consider it as a crisis which freed the constitution of our\r\n     government from one of its greatest defects.\"\r\n\r\nNow, my Lords, the delicacy of the affidavit is no more; the great\r\narcanum of the state is avowed: it is avowed that the government is\r\nours,--that the Nabob is nothing. It is avowed to foreign nations; and\r\nthe disguise which we have put on, Mr. Hastings states, in his opinion,\r\nto be hurtful to the affairs of the Company. Here we perceive the exact\r\nand the perfect agreement between his character as a delicate\r\naffidavit-maker in a court of justice and his indelicate declarations\r\nupon the records of the Company for the information of the whole world\r\nconcerning the real arcanum of the Bengal government.\r\n\r\nNow I cannot help praising his consistency upon this occasion, whether\r\nhis policy was right or wrong. Hitherto we find the whole consistent, we\r\nfind the affidavit perfectly supported. The inferences which delicacy at\r\nfirst prevented him from producing better recollection and more perfect\r\npolicy made him here avow. In this state things continued. The Nabob,\r\nyour Lordships see, is dead,--dead in law, dead in politics, dead in a\r\ncourt of justice, dead upon the records of the Company. Except in mere\r\nanimal existence, it is all over with him.\r\n\r\nI have now to state to your Lordships, that Mr. Hastings, who has the\r\npower of putting even to death in this way, possesses likewise the art\r\nof restoring to life. But what is the medicine that revives them? Your\r\nLordships, I am sure, will be glad to know what nostrum, not hitherto\r\npretended to by quacks in physic, by quacks in politics, nor by quacks\r\nin law, will serve to revive this man, to cover his dead bones with\r\nflesh, and to give him life, activity, and vigor. My Lords, I am about\r\nto tell you an instance of a recipe of such infallible efficacy as was\r\nnever before discovered. His cure for all disorders is disobedience to\r\nthe commands of his lawful superiors. When the orders of the Court of\r\nDirectors are contrary to his own opinions, he forgets them all. Let the\r\nCourt of Directors but declare in favor of his own system and his own\r\npositions, and that very moment, merely for the purpose of declaring his\r\nright of rebellion against the laws of his country, he counteracts them.\r\nThen these dead bones arise,--or, to use a language more suitable to\r\nthe dignity of the thing, Bayes's men are all revived. \"Are these men\r\ndead?\" asks Mr. Bayes's friend. \"No,\" says he, \"they shall all get up\r\nand dance immediately.\" But in this ludicrous view of Mr. Hastings's\r\nconduct, your Lordships must not lose sight of its great importance. You\r\ncannot have in an abstract, as it were, any one thing that better\r\ndevelops the principles of the man, that more fully develops all the\r\nsources of his conduct, and of all the frauds and iniquities which he\r\nhas committed, in order at one and the same time to evade his duty to\r\nthe Court of Directors, that is to say, to the laws of his country, and\r\nto oppress, crush, rob, and ill-treat the people that are under him.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, you have had an account of the person who represented the\r\nNabob's dignity, Mahomed Reza Khân; you have heard of the rank he bore,\r\nthe sufferings that he went through, his trial and honorable acquittal,\r\nand the Company's order that the first opportunity should be taken to\r\nappoint him Naib Subah, or deputy of the Nabob, and more especially to\r\nrepresent him in the administering of justice. Your Lordships are also\r\nacquainted with what was done in consequence of those orders by the\r\nCouncil-General, in the restoration and reëstablishment of the executive\r\npower in this person,--not in the poor Nabob, a poor, helpless,\r\nill-bred, ill-educated boy, but in the first Mussulman of the country,\r\nwho had before exercised the office of Naib Subah, or deputy\r\nviceroy,--in order to give some degree of support to the expiring honor\r\nand justice of that country. The majority, namely, General Clavering,\r\nColonel Monson, and Mr. Francis, whose names, as I have before said,\r\nwill, for obedience to the Company, fidelity to the laws, honor to\r\nthemselves, and a purity untouched and unimpeached, stand distinguished\r\nand honored, in spite of all the corrupt and barking virulence of India\r\nagainst them,--these men, I say, obeyed the Company: they had no secret\r\nor fraudulent connection with Mahomed Reza Khân; but they reinstated him\r\nin his office.\r\n\r\nThe moment that real death had carried away two of the most virtuous of\r\nthis community, and that Mr. Hastings was thereby reëstablished in his\r\npower, he returned to his former state of rebellion to the Company, and\r\nof fraud and oppression upon the people. And here we come to the\r\nrevivificating medicine. I forgot to tell your Lordships, that this\r\nNabob, whose letters were declared by a court of law, with his own\r\napprobation, to be in effect letters of the Governor-General and\r\nCouncil, concludes a formal application transmitted to them, and dated\r\n17th November, 1777, with a demand of the restoration of his rights. Mr.\r\nHastings upon this enters the following minute:--\r\n\r\n     \"The Nabob's demands are grounded upon positive rights, which will\r\n     not admit of a discussion; he has an incontestable right to the\r\n     management of his own household; he has an incontestable right to\r\n     the nizamut.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, you have heard his affidavit, you have heard his avowed and\r\nrecorded opinion. In direct defiance of both, because he wishes to make\r\ndoubtful the orders of the Company and to evade his duty, he here makes\r\nwithout any delicacy a declaration, which if it be true, the affidavit\r\nis a gross perjury, let it be managed with what delicacy he pleases. The\r\nword _nizamut_, which he uses, may be unfamiliar to your Lordships. In\r\nIndia it signifies the whole executive government, though the word\r\nstrictly means viceroyalty: all the princes of that country holding\r\ntheir dominions as representatives of the Mogul, the great nominal\r\nsovereign of the empire. To convince you that it does so, take his own\r\nexplanation of it.\r\n\r\n     \"It is his by inheritance: the adawlut and the foujdarry having\r\n     been repeatedly declared by the Company and by this government to\r\n     appertain to the nizamut. The adawlut, namely, the distribution of\r\n     civil justice, and the foujdarry, namely, the executive criminal\r\n     justice of that country, that is to say, the whole sovereign\r\n     government of the courts of justice, have been declared by the\r\n     Company to appertain to the nizamut.\"\r\n\r\nI beg of your Lordships to recollect, when you take into your\r\nconsideration the charges of the House of Commons, that the person they\r\naccuse, and persons suborned by him, have never scrupled to be guilty,\r\nwithout sense of shame, of the most notorious falsehoods, the most\r\nglaring inconsistencies, and even of perjury itself; and that it is thus\r\nthey make the power of the Company dead or alive, as best suits their\r\nown wicked, clandestine, and fraudulent purposes, and the great end of\r\nall their actions and all their politics plunder and peculation.\r\n\r\nI must here refer your Lordships to a minute of Mr. Francis's, which I\r\nrecommend to your reading at large, and to your very serious\r\nrecollection, in page 1086; because it contains a complete history of\r\nMr. Hastings's conduct, and of its effects upon this occasion.\r\n\r\nAnd now to proceed.--The Nabob, in a subsequent application to the\r\nCompany's government at Calcutta, desires that Munny Begum may be\r\nallowed to take on herself the whole administration of the affairs of\r\nthe nizamut, (not the superiority in the administration of the affairs\r\nof the seraglio only, though this would have been a tyrannical\r\nusurpation of the power belonging to the legitimate mother of the\r\nNabob,) without the interference of any person whatever; and he adds,\r\nthat by this the Governor will give him complete satisfaction. In all\r\nfraudulent correspondence you are sure to find the true secret of it at\r\nlast. It has been said by somebody, that the true sense of a letter is\r\nto be learnt from its postscript. But this matter is so clumsily\r\nmanaged, that, in contempt of all decency, the first thing the Nabob\r\ndoes is to desire he may be put into the hands of Munny Begum, and that\r\nwithout the interference of anybody whatever.\r\n\r\nThe next letter, immediately following on the heels of the former, was\r\nreceived by the Council on the 12th of February, 1778. In this letter he\r\ndesires that Mahomed Reza Khân may be removed from his office in the\r\ngovernment; and he expresses his hopes, that, as he himself is now come\r\nto years of maturity, and by the blessing of God is not so devoid of\r\nunderstanding as to be incapable of conducting his affairs, he says, \"I\r\nam therefore hopeful, from your favor and regard to justice, that you\r\nwill deliver me from the authority of the aforesaid Mahomed Reza Khân,\r\nand give your permission that I take on myself the management of the\r\nadawlut and foujdarry.\" There is no doubt of this latter application, in\r\ncontradiction to the former, having arisen from a suspicion that the\r\nappointment of Munny Begum would be too gross, and would shock the\r\nCouncil; and Mr. Hastings therefore orders the second letter to be\r\nwritten from the Nabob, in which he claims the powers of government for\r\nhimself. Then follows a letter from the Governor-General, informing the\r\nNabob that it had been agreed, that, his Excellency being now arrived at\r\nyears of maturity, the control of his own household, and the courts\r\ndependent on the nizamut and foujdarry, should be placed in his hands;\r\nand Mahomed Reza Khân was directed at the same time to resign his\r\nauthority to the Nabob.\r\n\r\nHere your Lordships see Munny Begum in effect completely invested with,\r\nand you will see how she has used her power: for I suppose your\r\nLordships are sick of the name of Nabob, as a real actor in the\r\ngovernment. You now see the true parties in the transaction,--namely,\r\nthe lover, Warren Hastings, Esquire, and Munny Begum, the object of his\r\npassion and flame, to which he sacrifices as much as Antony ever did to\r\nCleopatra. You see the object of his love and affection placed in the\r\nadministration of the viceroyalty; you see placed at her disposal the\r\nadministration of the civil judicature, and of the executory\r\njustice,--together with the salary which was intended for Mahomed Reza\r\nKhân.\r\n\r\nYour Lordships will be pleased to remember that this distribution of the\r\nNabob's government was made in direct defiance of the orders of the\r\nCompany. And as a further proof of this defiance, it will not escape\r\nyour Lordships, that, before this measure was carried into execution,\r\nMr. Barwell being one day absent from the Council, Mr. Hastings fell\r\ninto a minority; and it was agreed, upon that occasion, that the whole\r\naffair should be referred home to the Court of Directors, and that no\r\narrangement should be made till the Directors had given their opinion.\r\nMr. Hastings, the very moment after Mr. Barwell's return to his seat in\r\nthe Council, rescinds this resolution, which subjected the orders of the\r\nCourt of Directors to their own reconsideration; and he hurries headlong\r\nand precipitately into the execution of his first determination. Your\r\nLordships will also see in this act what sort of use Mr. Hastings made\r\nof the Council; and I have therefore insisted upon all these practices\r\nof the prisoner at your bar, because there is not one of them in which\r\nsome principle of government is not wounded, if not mortally wounded.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, we have laid before you the consequences of this proceeding.\r\nWe have shown what passed within the walls of the seraglio, and what\r\ntyranny was exercised by this woman over the multitude of women there. I\r\nshall now show your Lordships in what manner she made use of her power\r\nover the _supreme judicature_, to peculate, and to destroy the country;\r\nand I shall adduce, as proofs of this abuse of her authority, the facts\r\nI am about to relate, and of which there is evidence before your\r\nLordships.\r\n\r\nThere was an ostensible man, named Sudder ul Huk Khân, placed there at\r\nthe head of the administration of justice, with a salary of seven\r\nthousand pounds a year of the Company's money. This man, in a letter to\r\nthe Governor-General and Council, received the 1st of September, 1778,\r\nsays,--\"His Highness himself [the Nabob] is not deficient in regard for\r\nme, but certain bad men have gained an ascendency over his temper, by\r\nwhose instigation he acts.\" You will see, my Lords, how this poor man\r\nwas crippled in the execution of his duty, and dishonored by the\r\ncorruption of this woman and her eunuchs, to whom Mr. Hastings had given\r\nthe supreme government, and with it an uncontrolled influence over all\r\nthe dependent parts. After thus complaining of the slights he receives\r\nfrom the Nabob, he adds,--\"Thus they cause the Nabob to treat me,\r\nsometimes with indignity, at others with kindness, just as they think\r\nproper to advise him: their view is, that, by compelling me to\r\ndispleasure at such unworthy treatment, they may force me either to\r\nrelinquish my station, or to join with them and act with their advice,\r\nand appoint creatures of their recommendation to the different offices,\r\nfrom which they might draw profit to themselves.\" In a subsequent letter\r\nto the Governor, Sudder ul Huk Khân says,--\"The Begum's ministers,\r\nbefore my arrival, with the advice of their counsellors, caused the\r\nNabob to sign a receipt, in consequence of which they received, at two\r\ndifferent times, near fifty thousand rupees, in the name of the officers\r\nof the adawlut, foujdarry, &c., from the Company's sircar; and having\r\ndrawn up an account current in the manner they wished, they got the\r\nNabob to sign it, and then sent it to me.\" In the same letter he asserts\r\nthat these people have the Nabob entirely in their power.\r\n\r\nNow I have only to remark to your Lordships, that the first and\r\nimmediate operation of Mr. Hastings's regulation, which put everything\r\ninto the hands of this wicked woman for her corrupt purposes, was, that\r\nthe office of chief-justice was trampled upon and depraved, and made use\r\nof to plunder the Company of money, which was appropriated to their own\r\nuses,--and that the person ostensibly holding this office was forced to\r\nbecome the instrument in the hands of this wicked woman and her two\r\nwicked eunuchs. This, then, was the representation which the\r\nchief-justice made to Mr. Hastings, as one of the very first fruits of\r\nhis new arrangement. I am now to tell you what his next step was. This\r\nsame Mr. Hastings, who had made the Nabob master of everything and\r\nplaced everything at his disposal, who had maintained that the Nabob was\r\nnot to act a secondary part and to be a mere instrument in the hands of\r\nthe Company, who had, as you have seen, revived the Nabob, now puts him\r\nto death again. He pretends to be shocked at these proceedings of the\r\nNabob, and, not being able to prevent their coming before the Council of\r\nthe Directors at home, he immediately took Sudder ul Huk Khân under his\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\nNow your Lordships see Mr. Hastings appearing in his own character\r\nagain,--exercising the power he had pretended to abdicate, whilst the\r\nNabob sinks and subsides under him. He becomes the supporter of Sudder\r\nul Huk Khân, now that the infamy of the treatment he received could no\r\nlonger be concealed from the Council. On the 1st of September, 1778, the\r\nGovernor informs the Nabob, \"that it is highly expedient that Sudder ul\r\nHuk Khân should have full control in all matters relative to his office,\r\nand the sole appointment and dismission of the sudder and mofussil\r\nofficers; and that his seal and signature should be authentic to all\r\npapers having relation to the business intrusted to him: I therefore\r\nintimate to you, that he should appoint and dismiss all the officers\r\nunder him, and that your Excellency should not interfere in any one\r\n[way?].\"\r\n\r\nThe Nabob, in a letter to the Governor, received the 3d of September,\r\n1778, says,--\"Agreeably to your pleasure, I have relinquished all\r\nconcern with the affairs of the foujdarry and adawlut, leaving the\r\nentire management in Sudder ul Huk Khân's hands.\" Here you see the Nabob\r\nagain reduced to his former state of subordination. This\r\nchief-justiceship, which was declared to be his inherent right, he is\r\nobliged to submit to the control of Mr. Hastings, and to declare that he\r\nwill not interfere at all in a matter which Mr. Hastings had declared to\r\nbe his incommunicable attribute. I do not say that Mr. Hastings\r\ninterfered improperly. Certainly it was not fit that the highest court\r\nof justice in all Bengal should be made the instrument of the rapacity\r\nof a set of villains with a prostitute at their head: just as if a gang\r\nof thieves in England, with their prostitutes at their head, should\r\nseize the judge which ought to punish them, and endeavor to make use of\r\nhis name in their iniquitous transactions. But your Lordships will find\r\nthat Mr. Hastings is here acting a merely ostensible part, and that he\r\nhas always a means of defeating privately what he declares publicly to\r\nbe his intention. Your Lordships will see soon how this ended. Mr.\r\nHastings gets the Nabob to give up all his authority over the\r\nchief-justice; but he says not one word of Munny Begum, the person who\r\nhad the real authority in her hands, and who was not forbidden to\r\ninterfere with him. Mr. Hastings's order is dated the 1st September,\r\n1778. On the 3d of September, the Nabob is said to have relinquished all\r\nconcern with Sudder ul Huk Khân. In a letter received the 30th of\r\nSeptember, (that is, about twenty-seven days after the date of Mr.\r\nHastings's order,) you will see how this pretended order was managed.\r\nSudder ul Huk Khân thus writes, in a letter received the 30th of\r\nSeptember.\r\n\r\n     \"Yatibar Ali Khân,\" (Munny Begum's chief eunuch,) \"from the amount\r\n     of salaries of the officers of the adawlut and foujdarry, which\r\n     before my arrival he had received for two months from the sircar,\r\n     made disbursements according to his own pleasure. He had before\r\n     caused the sum of 7,400 rupees, on account of the price of mine and\r\n     my peshcar's khelauts, to be carried to account, and now\r\n     continually sends a man to demand from me 4,300 and odd rupees, as\r\n     a balance of the price of khelauts, and constantly presses me to\r\n     take it from the amount of the salaries of the officers of the\r\n     adawlut and foujdarry and send it to him; and I shall be under the\r\n     necessity of complying. I mention this for your information.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, you see again how Mr. Hastings's pretended orders were obeyed.\r\nThey were orders addressed to the Nabob, whom he knew to be nothing, and\r\nwho could neither control or take the least share in the execution of\r\nthem; but he leaves the thing loose as to Manny Begum and her eunuchs,\r\nwho he knew could alone carry them into effect. Your Lordships see that\r\nthe first use made of the restored authority of the Nabob was, under\r\nvarious pretences, to leave the salaries of the officers of government\r\nunprovided for, to rob the public treasury, and to give the Company's\r\nmoney to the eunuchs, who were acting in the manner I have stated to\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nInformation of these proceedings reaches Calcutta; a regular complaint\r\nfrom a person in the highest situation in the government is made, and\r\nthe Governor-General is obliged again to take up the matter; and I\r\nshall now read to your Lordships a letter of the 10th of October, 1778,\r\nwhich contains a representation so pointed and so very just of the fatal\r\neffects which his interference in the administration of justice had\r\nproduced as not to stand in need of any comment from me. It speaks too\r\nplainly to require any.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _The Governor-General's Letter to the Nabob_.\r\n\r\n     \"At your Excellency's request I sent Sudder ul Huk Khân to take on\r\n     him the administration of the affairs of the adawlut and foujdarry,\r\n     and hoped by that means not only to have given satisfaction to your\r\n     Excellency, but that, through his abilities and experience, these\r\n     affairs would have been conducted in such manner as to have secured\r\n     the peace of the country and the happiness of the people; and it is\r\n     with the greatest concern I learn that this measure is so far from\r\n     being attended with the expected advantages, that the affairs both\r\n     of the foujdarry and adawlut are in the greatest confusion\r\n     imaginable, and daily robberies and murders are perpetrated\r\n     throughout the country. This is evidently owing to the want of a\r\n     proper authority in the person appointed to superintend them. I\r\n     therefore addressed your Excellency on the importance and delicacy\r\n     of the affairs in question, and of the necessity of lodging full\r\n     power in the hands of the person chosen to administer them, in\r\n     reply to which your Excellency expressed sentiments coincident with\r\n     mine; notwithstanding which, your dependants and people, actuated\r\n     by selfish and avaricious views, have by their interference so\r\n     impeded the business as to throw the whole country into a state of\r\n     confusion, from which nothing can retrieve it but an unlimited\r\n     power lodged in the hands of the superintendent. I therefore\r\n     request that your Excellency will give the strictest injunctions to\r\n     all your dependants not to interfere in any manner with any matter\r\n     relative to the affairs of the adawlut and foujdarry, and that you\r\n     will yourself relinquish all interference therein, and leave them\r\n     entirely to the management of Sudder ul Huk Khân. This is\r\n     absolutely necessary to restore the country to a state of\r\n     tranquillity; and if your Excellency has any plan to propose for\r\n     the management of the affairs in future, be pleased to communicate\r\n     it to me, and every attention shall be paid to give your Excellency\r\n     satisfaction.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, I think I have read enough to you for our present\r\npurpose,--referring your Lordships for fuller information to your\r\nMinutes, page 1086, which I beg you to read with the greatest attention.\r\n\r\nI must again beg your Lordships to remark, that, though Mr. Hastings has\r\nthe impudence still to pretend that he wishes for the restoration of\r\norder and justice in the country, yet, instead of writing to Munny Begum\r\nupon the business, whom he knew to be the very object complained of, and\r\nwhose eunuchs are expressly mentioned in the complaint, he writes to the\r\nNabob, whom he knew to be a pageant in his own court and government, and\r\nwhose name was not even mentioned in this last complaint. Not one word\r\nis said, even in this letter to the Nabob, of Munny Begum or of her\r\neunuchs. My Lords, when you consider his tacit support of the authors of\r\nthe grievance, and his ostensible application for redress to the man\r\nwho he knew never authorized and could not redress the grievance, you\r\nmust conclude that he meant to keep the country in the same state for\r\nhis own corrupt purposes. In this state the country in fact continued;\r\nMunny Begum and her eunuchs continued to administer and squander the\r\nCompany's money, as well as the Nabob's; robberies and murders continued\r\nto prevail throughout the country. No appearance was left of order, law,\r\nor justice, from one end of Bengal to the other.\r\n\r\nThe account of this state of things was received by the Court of\r\nDirectors with horror and indignation. On the 27th of May, 1779, they\r\nwrite, as you will find in page 1063 of your printed Minutes, a letter\r\nto their government at Calcutta, condemning their proceedings and the\r\nremoval of Mahomed Reza Khân, and they order that Munny Begum shall be\r\ndisplaced, and Mahomed Reza Khân restored again to the seat of justice.\r\n\r\nMr. Francis, upon the arrival of these reiterated orders, moved in\r\nCouncil for an obedience to them. Mr. Hastings, notwithstanding he had\r\nbefore his eyes all the horrible consequences that attended his new\r\narrangement, still resists that proposition. By his casting voice in the\r\nCouncil he counter-orders the orders of the Court of Directors, and\r\nsanctions a direct disobedience to their authority, by a resolution that\r\nMahomed Reza Khân should not be restored to his employment, but that\r\nthis Sudder ul Huk Khân, who still continued in the condition already\r\ndescribed, should remain in the possession of his office. I say nothing\r\nof Sudder ul Huk Khân; he seems to be very well disposed to do his duty,\r\nif Mr. Hastings's arrangements had suffered him to do it; and indeed,\r\nif Mahomed Reza Khân had been reinstated, and no better supported by Mr.\r\nHastings than Sudder ul Huk Khân, he could probably have kept the\r\ncountry in no better order, though, perhaps, his name, and the authority\r\nand weight which still adhered to him in some degree, might have had\r\nsome influence.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, you have seen his defiance of the Company; you have seen his\r\ndefiance of all decency; you see his open protection of prostitutes and\r\nrobbers of every kind ravaging Bengal; you have seen this defiance of\r\nthe authority of the Court of Directors flatly, directly, and\r\nperemptorily persisted in to the last. Order after order was reiterated,\r\nbut his disobedience arose with an elastic spring in proportion to the\r\npressure that was upon it.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, here there was a pause. The Directors had been disobeyed; and\r\nyou might suppose that he would have been satisfied with this act of\r\ndisobedience. My Lords, he was resolved to let the native governments of\r\nthe country know that he despised the orders of the Court of Directors,\r\nand that, whenever he pretended to obey them, in reality he was resolved\r\nupon the most actual disobedience. An event now happened, the\r\nparticulars of which we are not to repeat here. Disputes, conducted, on\r\nMr. Francis's side, upon no other principle, that we can discover, but a\r\ndesire to obey the Company's orders, and to execute his duty with\r\nfidelity and disinterestedness, had arisen between him and Mr. Hastings.\r\nMr. Francis, about the time we have been speaking of, finding resistance\r\nwas vain, reconciles himself to him,--but on the most honorable terms as\r\na public man, namely, that he should continue to follow and obey the\r\nlaws, and to respect the authority of the Court of Directors. Upon this\r\nreconciliation, it was agreed that Mahomed Reza Khân should be restored\r\nto his office. For this purpose Mr. Hastings enters a minute, and writes\r\nto the Nabob an ostensible letter. But your Lordships will here see an\r\ninstance of what I said respecting a double current in all Mr.\r\nHastings's proceedings. Even when he obeys or pretends to obey the\r\nCompany's orders, there is always a private channel through which he\r\ndefeats them all.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Letter from Mr. Hastings to the Nabob Mobarek ul Dowlah, written\r\n     the 10th of February, 1780._\r\n\r\n     \"The Company, whose orders are peremptory, have directed that\r\n     Mahomed Reza Khân shall be restored to the offices he held in\r\n     January, 1778. It is my duty to represent this to your Excellency,\r\n     and to recommend your compliance with their request, that Mahomed\r\n     Reza Khân may be invested with the offices assigned to him under\r\n     the nizamut by the Company.\"\r\n\r\nYour Lordships see here that Mr. Hastings informs the Nabob, that,\r\nhaving received peremptory orders from the Company, he restores and\r\nreplaces Mahomed Reza Khân. Mahomed Reza Khân, then, is in\r\npossession,--and in possession by the best of all titles, the orders of\r\nthe Company. But you will also see the manner in which he evades his\r\nduty, and vilifies in the eyes of these miserable country powers the\r\nauthority of the Directors. He is prepared, as usual, with a defeasance\r\nof his own act; and the manner in which that defeasance came to our\r\nknowledge is this. We knew nothing of this private affair, till Mr.\r\nHastings, in his answer before the House of Commons, finding it\r\nnecessary to destroy the validity of some of his own acts, brought\r\nforward Sir John D'Oyly. He was brought forward before us, not as a\r\nwitness in his own person for the defence of Mr. Hastings, but as a\r\nnarrator who had been employed by Mr. Hastings as a member of that\r\nCouncil which, as you have heard, drew up his defence. My Lords, you\r\nhave already seen the public agency of this business, you have heard\r\nread the public letter sent to the Nabob: there you see the ostensible\r\npart of the transaction. Now hear the banian, Sir John D'Oyly, give an\r\naccount of his part in it, extracted from Mr. Hastings's defence before\r\nthe House of Commons.\r\n\r\n     \"I was appointed Resident [at the Court of the Nabob] on the\r\n     resignation of Mr. Byam Martin, in the month of January, 1780, and\r\n     took charge about the beginning of February of the same year. The\r\n     substance of the instructions I received was, to endeavor, by every\r\n     means in my power, to conciliate the good opinion and regard of the\r\n     Nabob and his family, that I might be able to persuade him to adopt\r\n     effectual measures for the better regulation of his expenses, which\r\n     were understood to have greatly exceeded his income; that I might\r\n     prevent his forming improper connections, or taking any steps\r\n     derogatory to his rank, and by every means in my power support his\r\n     credit and dignify in the eyes of the world; and with respect to\r\n     the various branches of his family, I was instructed to endeavor to\r\n     put a stop to the dissensions which had too frequently prevailed\r\n     amongst them. The Nabob, on his part, was recommended to pay the\r\n     same attention to my advice as he would have done to that of the\r\n     Governor-General in person. Some time, I think, in the month of\r\n     February of the same year, I received a letter from Mr. Hastings,\r\n     purporting that the critical situation of affairs requiring the\r\n     union and utmost exertion of every member of the government to give\r\n     vigor to the acts necessary for its relief, he had agreed to an\r\n     accommodation with Mr. Francis; but to effect this point he had\r\n     been under the necessity of making some painful sacrifices, and\r\n     particularly that of the restoration of Mahomed Reza Khân to the\r\n     office of Naib Subah, a measure which he knew must be highly\r\n     disagreeable to the Nabob, and which nothing but the urgent\r\n     necessity of the case should have led him to acquiesce in; that he\r\n     relied on me to state all these circumstances in the most forcible\r\n     manner to the Nabob, and to urge his compliance, assuring him that\r\n     it should not continue longer than until the next advices were\r\n     received from the Court of Directors.\"\r\n\r\nHere Mr. Hastings himself lets us into the secrets of his government. He\r\nwrites an ostensible letter to the Nabob, declaring that what he does is\r\nin conformity to the orders of the Company. He writes a private letter,\r\nin which he directs his agent to assure the Nabob that what he had done\r\nwas not in compliance with the orders of the Company, but in consequence\r\nof the arrangement he had made with Mr. Francis, which arrangement he\r\nthought necessary for the support of his own personal power. His design,\r\nin thus explaining the transaction to the Nabob, was in order to\r\nprevent the native powers from looking to any other authority than his,\r\nand from having the least hopes of redress of their complaints from the\r\njustice of this country or from any legal power in it. He therefore\r\ntells him that Mahomed Reza Khân was replaced, not in obedience to the\r\norders of the Company, but to gratify Mr. Francis. If he quarrels with\r\nMr. Francis, he makes that a reason for disobeying the orders of his\r\nmasters; if he agrees with him, he informs the people concerned in the\r\ntransaction, privately, that he acts, not in consequence of the orders\r\nthat he has received, but from other motives. But that is not all. He\r\npromises that he will take the first opportunity to remove Mahomed Reza\r\nKhân from his office again. Thus the country is to be re-plunged into\r\nthe same distracted and ruined state in which it was before. And all\r\nthis is laid open fully and distinctly before you. You have it on the\r\nauthority of Sir John D'Oyly. Sir John D'Oyly is a person in the secret;\r\nand one man who is in the secret is worth a thousand ostensible persons.\r\n\r\nMahomed Reza Khân, I must now tell you, was accordingly reinstated in\r\nall his offices, and the Nabob was reduced to the situation, as Mr.\r\nHastings upon another occasion describes it, of a mere cipher. But mark\r\nwhat followed,--mark what this Sir John D'Oyly is made to tell you, or\r\nwhat Mr. Hastings tells you for him: for whether Sir John D'Oyly has\r\nwritten this for Mr. Hastings, or Mr. Hastings for Sir John D'Oyly, I do\r\nnot know; because they seem, as somebody said of two great friends, that\r\nthey had but one will, one bed, and one hat between them. These\r\ngentlemen who compose Mr. Hastings's Council have but one style of\r\nwriting among them; so that it is impossible for you to determine by\r\nwhich of the masters of this Roman school any paper was\r\nwritten,--whether by D'Oyly, by Shore, or by Hastings, or any other of\r\nthem. They have a style in common, a kind of bank upon which they have a\r\ngeneral credit; and you cannot tell to whose account anything is to be\r\nplaced.\r\n\r\nBut to proceed.--Sir John D'Oyly says there, that the Nabob is reduced\r\nagain to a cipher. Now hear what he afterwards says. \"About the month of\r\nJune, 1781, Mr. Hastings, being then at Moorshedabad, communicated to me\r\nhis intention of performing his promise to the Nabob, by restoring him\r\nto the management of his own affairs,\"--that is to say, by restoring\r\nMunny Begum again, and by turning out Mahomed Reza Khân. Your Lordships\r\nsee that he communicated privately his intentions to Sir John D'Oyly,\r\nwithout communicating one word of them to his colleagues in the Supreme\r\nCouncil, and without entering any minute in the records of the Council,\r\nby which it could be known to the Directors.\r\n\r\nLastly, in order to show you in what manner the Nabob was to be restored\r\nto his power, I refer your Lordships to the order he gave to Sir John\r\nD'Oyly for investigating the Nabob's accounts, and for drawing up\r\narticles of instructions for the Nabob's conduct in the management of\r\nhis affairs. You will there see clearly how he was restored: that is to\r\nsay, that he was taken out of the hands of the first Mussulman in that\r\ncountry, the man most capable of administering justice, and whom the\r\nCompany had expressly ordered to be invested with that authority, and to\r\nput him into the hands of Sir John D'Oyly. Is Sir John D'Oyly a\r\nMussulman? Is Sir John D'Oyly fit to be at the head of such a\r\ngovernment? What was there that any person could see about him, that\r\nentitled him to or made him a fit person to be intrusted with this\r\npower, in defiance of the Company's orders? And yet Mahomed Reza Khân,\r\nwho was to have the management of the Nabob's affairs, was himself put\r\nunder the most complete and perfect subjection to this Sir John D'Oyly.\r\nBut, in fact, Munny Begum had the real influence in everything. Sir John\r\nD'Oyly himself was only Mr. Hastings's instrument there to preserve it,\r\nand between them they pillaged the Nabob in the most shocking manner,\r\nand must have done so to the knowledge of Mr. Hastings. A letter written\r\nat this time by Mr. Hastings to the Nabob discovers the secret beyond\r\nall power of evasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Instructions from the Governor-General to the Nabob Mobarek ul\r\n     Dowlah, respecting his Conduct in the Management of his Affairs._\r\n\r\n     \"9th. These I make the conditions of the compliance which the\r\n     Governor-General and Council have yielded to your late requisition.\r\n     It is but just that you should possess what is your acknowledged\r\n     right; but their intention would be defeated, and you would be in a\r\n     worse situation, if you were to be left a prey, without a guide,\r\n     until you have acquired experience, (which, to the strength and\r\n     goodness of your understanding, will be the work but of a short\r\n     period,) to the rapacity, frauds, and artifices of mankind. You\r\n     have offered to give up the sum of four lacs of rupees to be\r\n     allowed the free use of the remainder of your stipend. This we have\r\n     refused, because it would be contrary to justice. You should\r\n     consider this as a proof of the sincerity of the above\r\n     arrangements which have been recommended to you, and of their\r\n     expediency to your real interests; and your attention to them will\r\n     be a means of reconciling the Company to the resolution which we\r\n     have taken, and which will be reported to them in a light very\r\n     hurtful both to you and to us, if an improper effect should attend\r\n     it. These I have ordered Sir John D'Oyly to read in your presence,\r\n     and to explain them to you, that no part of them may escape your\r\n     notice; and he has my positive orders to remonstrate to you against\r\n     every departure from them. Upon all these occasions, I hope and\r\n     expect that you will give him a particular and cordial attention,\r\n     and regard what he shall say as if said by myself; for I know him\r\n     to be a person of the strictest honor and integrity. I have a\r\n     perfect reliance on him; and you cannot have a more attached or\r\n     more disinterested counsellor. Although I desire to receive your\r\n     letters frequently, yet, as many matters will occur which cannot so\r\n     easily be explained by letter as by conversation, I desire that you\r\n     will on such occasions give your orders to him respecting such\r\n     points as you may desire to have imparted to me; and I, postponing\r\n     every other concern, will give you an immediate and the most\r\n     satisfactory reply concerning them.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, here is a man who is to administer his own affairs, who has\r\narrived at sufficient age to supersede the counsel and advice of the\r\ngreat Mahometan doctors and the great nobility of the country, and he is\r\nput under the most absolute guardianship of Sir John D'Oyly. But Mr.\r\nHastings has given Sir John D'Oyly a great character. I cannot confirm\r\nit, because I can confirm the character of none of Mr. Hastings's\r\ninstruments. They must stand forth here, and defend their own character\r\nbefore you.\r\n\r\nYour Lordships will now be pleased to advert to another circumstance in\r\nthis transaction. You see here 40,000_l._ a year offered by this man for\r\nhis redemption. \"I will give you,\" he says, \"40,000_l._ a year to have\r\nthe management of my own affairs.\" Good heavens! Here is a man, who,\r\naccording to Mr. Hastings's assertion, had an indisputable right to the\r\nmanagement of his own affairs, but at the same time was notoriously so\r\nlittle fit to have the management of them as to be always under some\r\ncorrupt tyranny or other, offers 40,000_l._ a year out of his own\r\nrevenues to be left his own master, and to be permitted to have the\r\ndisposal of the remainder. Judge you of the bribery, rapine, and\r\npeculation which here stare you in the face. Judge of the nature and\r\ncharacter of that government for the management of which 40,000_l._, out\r\nof 160,000_l._ a year of its revenue, is offered by a subordinate to the\r\nsupreme authority of the country. This offer shows that at this time the\r\nNabob had it not himself. Who had it? Sir John D'Oyly; he is brought\r\nforward as the person to whom is given the management of the whole.\r\nMunny Begum had the management before. But, whether it be an Englishman,\r\na Mussulman, a white man or a black man, a white woman or a black woman,\r\nit is all Warren Hastings.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the four lacs of rupees, he gets Sir John D'Oyly, in the\r\nnarrative that he makes before the House of Commons, positively to deny\r\nin the strongest manner, and he says the Nabob would give oath of it,\r\nthat the Nabob never gave a commission to any one to make such an\r\noffer. That such an offer was made had been long published and long in\r\nprint, with the remarks such as I have made upon it in the Ninth Report\r\nof the Select Committee; that the Committee had so done was well known\r\nto Mr. Hastings and Sir John D'Oyly; not one word on the part of Mr.\r\nHastings, not one word on the part of Sir John D'Oyly was said to\r\ncontradict it, until the appearance of the latter before the House of\r\nCommons. But, my Lords, there is something much more serious in this\r\ntransaction. It is this,--that the evidence produced by Mr. Hastings is\r\nthe evidence of witnesses who are mere phantoms; they are persons who\r\ncould not, under Mr. Hastings's government, eat a bit of bread but upon\r\nhis own terms, and they are brought forward to give such evidence as may\r\nanswer his purposes.\r\n\r\nYou would naturally have imagined, that, in the House of Commons, where\r\nclouds of witnesses had been before produced by the friends and agents\r\nof Mr. Hastings, he would then have brought forward Sir John to\r\ncontradict this reported offer; but not a word from Sir John D'Oyly. At\r\nlast he is examined before the Committee of Managers. He refuses to\r\nanswer. Why? Because his answers might criminate himself. My Lords,\r\nevery answer that most of them have been required to make they are\r\nsensible they cannot make without danger of criminating themselves,\r\nbeing all involved in the crimes of the prisoner. He has corrupted and\r\nruined the whole service; there is not one of them that dares appear and\r\ngive a fair and full answer in any case, as you have seen in Mr.\r\nMiddleton, and many others at your bar. \"I will not answer this\r\nquestion,\" they say, \"because it tends to criminate myself.\" How comes\r\nit that the Company's servants are not able to give evidence in the\r\naffairs of Mr. Hastings, without its tending to criminate themselves?\r\n\r\nWell,--Sir John D'Oyly is in England,--why is he not called now? I have\r\nnot the honor of being intimately acquainted with him, but he is a man\r\nof a reputable and honorable family. Why is he not called by Mr.\r\nHastings to verify the assertion, and why do they suffer this black\r\nrecord to stand before your Lordships to be urged by us, and to press it\r\nas we do against him? If he knows that Sir John D'Oyly can acquit him of\r\nthis part of our accusation, he would certainly bring him as a witness\r\nto your bar; but he knows he cannot. When, therefore, I see upon your\r\nrecords that Sir John D'Oyly and Mr. Hastings received such an offer for\r\nthe redemption of the Nabob's affairs out of their hands, I conclude,\r\nfirst, that at the time of this offer the Nabob had not the disposal of\r\nhis own affairs,--and, secondly, that those who had the disposal of them\r\ndisposed of them so corruptly and prodigally that he thought they could\r\nhardly be redeemed at too high a price. What explanation of this matter\r\nhas been attempted? There is no explanation given of it at all. It\r\nstands clear, full, bare in all its nakedness before you. They have not\r\nattempted to produce the least evidence against it. Therefore in that\r\nstate I leave it with you; and I shall only add, that Mr. Hastings\r\ncontinued to make Munny Begum the first object of his attention, and\r\nthat, though he could not entirely remove Mahomed Reza Khân from the\r\nseat of justice, he was made a cipher in it. All his other offices were\r\ntaken out of his hands and put into the hands of Sir John D'Oyly,\r\ndirectly contrary to the orders of the Company, which certainly implied\r\nthe restitution of Mahomed Reza Khân to all the offices which he had\r\nbefore held. He was stripped of everything but a feeble administration\r\nof justice, which, I take for granted, could not, under the\r\ncircumstances, have been much better in his hands than it had been in\r\nSudder ul Huk Khân's.\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings's protection of this woman continued to the last; and when\r\nhe was going away, on the 3d of November, 1783, he wrote a sentimental\r\nletter to the Court of Directors in her praise. This letter was\r\ntransmitted without having been communicated to the Council. You have\r\nheard of delicate affidavits; here you have a sentimental official\r\ndespatch: your Lordships will find it in page 1092 and 1093 of your\r\nprinted Minutes. He writes in such a delicate, sentimental strain of\r\nthis woman, that I will venture to say you will not find in all the\r\n\"Arcadia,\" in all the novels and romances that ever were published, an\r\ninstance of a greater, a more constant, and more ardent affection,\r\ndefying time, ugliness, and old age, did ever exist, than existed in Mr.\r\nHastings towards this old woman, Munny Begum. As cases of this kind,\r\ncases of gallantry abounding in sentimental expressions, are rare in the\r\nCompany's records, I recommend it as a curiosity to your Lordships'\r\nreading, as well as a proof of what is the great spring and movement of\r\nall the prisoner's actions. On this occasion he thus speaks of Munny\r\nBegum.\r\n\r\n     \"She, too, became the victim of your policy, and of the resentments\r\n     which succeeded. Something, too, she owed of the source of her\r\n     misfortunes to the belief of the personal gratitude which she\r\n     might entertain for the public attention which I had shown to her.\r\n     Yet, exposed as she was to a treatment which a ruffian would have\r\n     shuddered at committing, and which no recollection of past enmities\r\n     shall compel me to believe, even for a moment, proceeded from any\r\n     commission of authority, she still maintained the decorum of her\r\n     character; nor even then, nor before, nor since that period, has\r\n     the malice of calumny ever dared to breathe on her\r\n     reputation.\"--Delicate! sentimental!--\"Pardon, honorable Sirs, this\r\n     freedom of expostulation. I must in honest truth repeat, that your\r\n     commands laid the first foundation of her misfortunes; to your\r\n     equity she has now recourse through me for their alleviation, that\r\n     she may pass the remainder of her life in a state which may at\r\n     least efface the remembrance of the years of her affliction; and to\r\n     your humanity she and an unseen multitude of the most helpless of\r\n     her sex cry for subsistence.\"\r\n\r\nMoving and pathetic!--I wish to recommend every word of this letter to\r\nyour Lordships' consideration, as a model and pattern of perfection.\r\nObserve his pity for a woman who had suffered such treatment from the\r\nservants of the Company (a parcel of ruffians!)--treatment that a\r\nruffian would be ashamed of! Your Lordships have seen, in the evidence,\r\nwhat this ruffianism was. It was neither more nor less than what was\r\nnecessary in order to get at the accounts, which she concealed, as his\r\nown corrupt transactions. She was told, indeed, that she must privately\r\nremove to another house whilst her papers were examining. Mr. Hastings\r\ncan never forget this. He cannot believe that anybody dare send such an\r\norder; and he calls upon you to consider the helplessness of their sex,\r\nand the affronts offered to women.\r\n\r\nFor Heaven's sake, my Lords, recollect the manner in which Mr. Hastings\r\nand his creatures treated the Begums of Oude, and consider that this\r\nwoman was only threatened (for the threat was never attempted to be\r\nexecuted) that she must, if she did not deliver up the accounts,\r\nprobably be removed to another house, and leave the accounts behind her.\r\nThis blot can never be effaced; and for this he desires the Court of\r\nDirectors to make her a large allowance to comfort her in her old age.\r\nIn this situation Mr. Hastings leaves her. He leaves in the situation I\r\nhave described the justice of the country. The only concern he has at\r\nparting is, that this woman may have a large allowance.\r\n\r\nBut I have yet to tell your Lordships, and it appears upon your printed\r\nMinutes, that this woman had a way of comforting herself:--for old\r\nladies of that description, who have passed their youth in amusements,\r\nin dancing, and in gallantries, in their old age are apt to take comfort\r\nin brandy. This lady was a smuggler, and had influence enough to avoid\r\npayment of the duty on spirits, in which article she is the largest\r\ndealer in the district,--as, indeed, she is in almost every species of\r\ntrade. Thus your Lordships see that this sentimental lady, whom Mr.\r\nHastings recommends to the Directors, had ways of comforting herself.\r\nShe carried on, notwithstanding her dignity, a trade in spirits. Now a\r\nMahometan of distinction never carries on any trade at all,--it is an\r\nunknown thing,--very few Mahometans of any rank carry on any trade at\r\nall; but that a Mahometan should carry on a trade in spirits is a\r\nprodigy never heard of before; for a woman of quality, for a woman of\r\nsentiment, to become a dealer in spirits is, my Lords, a thing reserved\r\nfor the sentimental age of Mr. Hastings; and I will venture to say that\r\nno man or woman could attempt any such a trade in India, without being\r\ndishonored, ruined in character, and disgraced by it. But she appears\r\nnot only to have been a dealer in it, but, through the influence which\r\nMr. Hastings gave her, to have monopolized the trade in brandy, and to\r\nhave evaded the duties. This, then, is the state in which we leave the\r\ntwo sentimental lovers,--the one consoling herself with brandy, the\r\nother wheedling and whining; and, as Swift describes the progress of an\r\nintrigue in some respects similar, which he calls \"The Progress of\r\nLove,\" whereas this is the Progress of Sentiment,\r\n\r\n    \"They keep at Staines the Old Blue Boar,\r\n    Are cat and dog, and rogue and whore.\"\r\n\r\nHere they set up the sign of the Old Blue Boar. Munny Begum monopolizes\r\nthe trade in spirits; and hence she and Mr. Hastings commence their\r\nsentimental correspondence.--And now, having done with this progress of\r\nlove, we return to the progress of justice.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have seen how Sudder ul Huk Khân, the chief-justice of Mr. Hastings's\r\nown nomination, was treated. Now you shall see how justice was left to\r\nshift for herself under Mahomed Reza Khân. In page 1280 of your\r\nLordships' Minutes you will see the progress of all these\r\nenormities,--of Munny Begum's dealing in spirits, of her engrossing the\r\ntrade, of her evading duties,--and, lastly, the extinction of all order\r\nin that country, and the funeral of justice itself. Mr. Shore's evidence\r\nrespecting this state of the country will admit of no doubt.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Mr. Shore's Remarks accompanying the Governor-General's Minutes of\r\n     the 18th May, 1785._\r\n\r\n     \"Foujdarry jurisdiction.--Of the foujdarry jurisdiction nothing has\r\n     yet been said. In this department criminal justice is administered,\r\n     and it is the only office left to the Nabob. I do not see any\r\n     particular reason for changing the system itself, and perhaps it\r\n     would on many accounts be improper; but some regulations are highly\r\n     necessary. Mahomed Reza is at the head of this department, and is\r\n     the only person I know in the country qualified for it. If he were\r\n     left to himself, I have not a doubt but he would conduct it well;\r\n     but he is so circumscribed by recommendations of particular\r\n     persons, and by the protection held out to his officers by\r\n     Europeans, that to my knowledge he has not been able to punish\r\n     them, even when they have been convicted of the greatest\r\n     enormities; and he has often on this account been blamed, where his\r\n     hands were tied up.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, you now see in this minute of Sir John Shore, now\r\nGovernor-General of Bengal, one of Mr. Hastings's own committee for\r\ndrawing up his defence, the review which he had just then taken of the\r\nruins of the government which had been left to him by Mr. Hastings. You\r\nsee here not the little paltry things which might deserve in their\r\ncauses the animadversion of a rough satirist like Doctor Swift, whom I\r\nhave just quoted, but you see things ten thousand times more serious,\r\nthings that deserve the thunderbolt of vindictive justice upon the head\r\nof the prisoner at your bar. For you see, that, after he had ostensibly\r\nrestored Mahomed Reza Khân, the man who could and would have executed\r\nhis office with fidelity and effect, the man who was fit for and\r\ndisposed to do his duty, there was still neither law, order, nor justice\r\nin the country. Why? Because of the interposition of Europeans, and men\r\nwho must have been patronized and supported by Europeans. All this\r\nhappened before Mr. Hastings's departure: so that the whole effect of\r\nthe new arrangement of government was known to him before he left\r\nCalcutta. The same pretended remedy was applied. But in fact he left\r\nthis woman in the full possession of her power. His last thoughts were\r\nfor her; for the justice of the country, for the peace and security of\r\nthe people of Bengal, he took no kind of care; these great interests\r\nwere left to the mercy of the woman and her European associates.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, I have taken some pains in giving you this history. I have\r\nshown you his open acts and secret stratagems, in direct rebellion to\r\nthe Court of Directors,--his double government, his false pretences of\r\nrestoring the Nabob's independence, leading in effect to a most servile\r\ndependence, even to the prohibition of the approach of any one, native\r\nor European, near him, but through the intervention of Sir John D'Oyly.\r\nI therefore again repeat it, that Sir John D'Oyly, and the English\r\ngentlemen who were patronized and countenanced by Mr. Hastings, had\r\nwrought all that havoc in the country before Mr. Hastings left it.\r\n\r\nI have particularly dwelt upon the administration of justice, because I\r\nconsider it as the source of all good, and the maladministration of it\r\nas the source of all evil in the country. Your Lordships have heard how\r\nit was totally destroyed by Mr. Hastings through Sir John D'Oyly, who\r\nwas sent there by him for the purpose of forming a clandestine\r\ngovernment of corruption and peculation. This part of our charge speaks\r\nfor itself, and I shall dismiss it with a single observation,--that not\r\nthe least trace of an account of all these vast sums of money delivered\r\ninto the hands of Sir John D'Oyly for the use of the Nabob appears in\r\nany part of the Company's records. The undeniable inferences to be drawn\r\nfrom this fact are, first, that, wherever we find concealment of money,\r\nand the ceasing of an account, there has been fraud,--and, secondly,\r\nthat, if we find this concealment accompanied with the devastation of a\r\ncountry, and the extinction of justice in it, that devastation of the\r\ncountry and that extinction of justice have been the result of that\r\nfraudulent peculation.\r\n\r\nI am sure your Lordships will not think that a charge of the\r\nannihilation of administrative justice, in which the happiness and\r\nprosperity of a great body of nobility, of numerous ancient and\r\nrespectable families, and of the inhabitants in general of extensive and\r\npopulous provinces are concerned, can, if it stood single and alone, be\r\na matter of trifling moment. And in favor of whom do all these\r\nsacrifices appear to have been made? In favor of an old prostitute, who,\r\nif shown to your Lordships here, like Helen to the counsellors of Troy,\r\nwould not, I think, be admitted to have charms that could palliate this\r\nman's abominable conduct; you would not cry out with them,--\r\n\r\n    [Greek: Ou nemesis, ...\r\n            Toiêd' amphi gunaiki polun chronon algea paschein.]\r\n\r\nFor I will fairly say that there are some passions that have their\r\nexcuses; but the passion towards this woman was the passion of avarice\r\nand rapacity only,--a passion, indeed, which lasted to the end of his\r\ngovernment, and for which he defied the orders of the Court of\r\nDirectors, rebelled against his masters, and finally subverted the\r\njustice of a great country.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy Lords, I have done with this business. I come next to the third\r\ndivision of the natives, those who form the landed interest of the\r\ncountry. A few words only will be necessary upon this part of the\r\nsubject. The fact is, that Mr. Hastings, at one stroke, put up the\r\nproperty of all the nobility and gentry, and of all the freeholders, in\r\nshort, the whole landed interest of Bengal, to a public auction, and let\r\nit to the highest bidder. I will make no observations upon the nature of\r\nthis measure to your Lordships, who represent so large a part of the\r\ndignity, together with so large a part of the landed interest of this\r\nkingdom: though I think, that, even under your Lordships' restrictive\r\norder, I am entitled so to do; because we have examined some witnesses\r\nupon this point, in the revenue charge. Suffice it to say, that it is in\r\nevidence before your Lordships that this sale was ordered. Mr. Hastings\r\ndoes not deny it. He says, indeed, he did it not with an ill intention.\r\nMy answer is, that it could have been done with no other than a bad\r\nintention. The owners of the land had no way left to save themselves but\r\nto become farmers of their own estates; and from the competition which\r\nnaturally took place, (and he himself declared, that the persons,\r\nwhether owners or strangers, to whom he let the lands, had agreed to\r\nrents which surpassed their abilities to pay,) I need not tell you what\r\nmust have been the consequence, when it got into such rapacious hands,\r\nand was taken out of the hands of its natural proprietors: that the\r\npublic revenue had sunk and lost by it, and that the country was wasted\r\nand destroyed. I leave it to your Lordships' own meditation and\r\nreflection; and I shall not press it one step further than just to\r\nremind you of what has been so well opened and pressed by my fellow\r\nManagers. He, Mr. Hastings, confesses that he let the lands to his own\r\nbanians; he took his own domestic servants and put them in the houses of\r\nthe nobility of the country; and this he did in direct violation of an\r\nexpress order made by himself, that no banian of a collector (the spirit\r\nof which order implied ten thousand times more strongly the exclusion of\r\nany banians of a Governor-General) should have any one of those farms.\r\nWe also find that he made a regulation that no farmers should rent more\r\nthan a lac of rupees; but at the same time we find his banians holding\r\nseveral farms to more than that amount. In short, we find that in every\r\ninstance, where, under some plausible pretence or other, the fixed\r\nregulations are violated, it touches him so closely as to make it\r\nabsolutely impossible not to suppose that he himself had the advantage\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nFor, in the first place, you have proof that he does take bribes, and\r\nthat he has corrupt dealings. This is what he admits; but he says that\r\nhe has done it from public-spirited motives. Now there is a rule,\r\nformed upon a just, solid presumption of law, that, if you find a man\r\nguilty of one offence contrary to known law, whenever there is a\r\nsuspicious case against him of the same nature, the _onus probandi_ that\r\nhe is not guilty is turned upon him. Therefore, when I find the\r\nregulations broken,--when I find farms given of more than a lac of\r\nrupees,--when I find them given to the Governor-General's own banian,\r\ncontrary to the principle of the regulation, contrary, I say, in the\r\nstrongest way to it,--when I find that he accumulates farms beyond the\r\nregulated number,--when I find all these things done, and besides that\r\nthe banian has great balances of account against him,--then, by the\r\npresumption of law, I am bound to believe that all this was done, not\r\nfor the servants, but for the master.\r\n\r\nIt is possible Mr. Hastings might really be in love with Munny Begum; be\r\nit so,--many great men have played the fool for prostitutes, from Mark\r\nAntony's days downwards; but no man ever fell in love with his own\r\nbanian. The persons for whom Mr. Hastings was guilty of all this rapine\r\nand oppression have neither relations nor kindred whom they own, nor\r\ndoes any trace of friendship exist among them; they do not live in\r\nhabits of intimacy with any one; they are good fellows and\r\nbottle-companions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI must now proceed to observe upon another matter which has been stated\r\nto your Lordships,--namely, that, as soon as he obtained the majority in\r\nthe Council, (that beginning of all evils, that opening of Pandora's\r\nbox,) by the death of General Clavering and Colonel Monson, the first\r\nthing he did was to appoint a commission, called an _aumeeny_, to go\r\nthrough the whole country, to enter every man's house, to examine his\r\ntitle-deeds, and to demand his papers of accounts of every kind, for the\r\npurpose of enabling himself to take advantage of the hopes and fears of\r\nall the parties concerned, and thus to ravage and destroy all their\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nAnd whom does he place at the head of this commission, to be the manager\r\nof the whole affair? Gunga Govind Sing, another banian of his, and one\r\nof his own domestic servants. This we have discovered lately, and not\r\nwithout some surprise; for though I knew he kept a rogue in his house,\r\nyet I did not think that it was a common receptacle of thieves and\r\nrobbers. I did not know till lately that this Gunga Govind Sing was his\r\ndomestic servant; but Mr. Hastings, in a letter to the Court of\r\nDirectors, calls him his faithful domestic servant, and as such calls\r\nupon the Company to reward him. To this banian all the Company's\r\nservants are made subject; they are bound to obey all his orders, and\r\nthose of his committee. I hope I need not tell your Lordships what sort\r\nof stuff this committee was made of, by which Gunga Govind Sing was\r\nenabled to ravage the whole country.\r\n\r\nBut, say his counsel, Mr. Hastings thought that the value of the lands\r\nwas thoroughly known; they had been investigated three times over, and\r\nthey were all let by public auction to the highest bidder.--This may or\r\nmay not be a true test of their value; but it is a test which, as it led\r\nto the almost entire confiscation of the landed interest of Bengal,\r\nBahar, and Orissa, three great kingdoms, by a dash of that man's pen,\r\ninto the hands of his banians and creatures, I can never think of it,\r\nor of its author, without horror.\r\n\r\nSome people say, you ought to hate the crime and love the criminal. No,\r\nthat is the language of false morality; you ought to hate the crime and\r\nthe criminal, if the crime is of magnitude. If the crime is a small one,\r\nthen you ought to be angry with the crime and reluctant to punish the\r\ncriminal; but when there are great crimes, then you may hate them\r\ntogether. What! am I to love Nero? to fall in love with Heliogabalus? is\r\nDomitian to be the subject of my affection? No, we hate the crime, and\r\nwe hate the criminal ten times more; and if I use indignant language, if\r\nI use the language of scorn and horror with respect to the criminal, I\r\nuse the language that becomes me.\r\n\r\nBut, says one of the counsel, the Company might possess a knowledge of\r\nthe country in general, but they could not know every _bega_, of it,\r\n(about the third part of an acre of land,) without such a commission.\r\nThat is to say, you could not squeeze everything out of the people,\r\nwithout ordering such a villain as Gunga Govind Sing, (I call things, by\r\ntheir names,) that most atrocious and wicked instrument of the most\r\natrocious and wicked tyranny, to examine every man's papers, to oblige\r\nevery man to produce his titles and accounts upon pain of criminal\r\npunishment, to be inflicted at the discretion of this commissioner, this\r\nGunga Govind Sing. For an account of these acts, and for a description\r\nof an aumeeny, I refer your Lordships to the evidence in your Minutes,\r\nfrom page 1287 to 1301; and I pass on, expressing only my horror and\r\ndetestation at it, and wishing to kindle in your Lordships' minds the\r\nsame horror and detestation of it.\r\n\r\nThus you see that Mr. Hastings was not satisfied with confiscation only.\r\nHe comes just afterwards with a blister upon the sore. He lets loose\r\nanother set of ravagers and inquisitors upon them, under Gunga Govind\r\nSing, and these poor people are ravaged by the whole tribe of Calcutta\r\nbanians.\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings has himself defined an aumeen in page 1022, where he states\r\nthat Nundcomar desired him to make his son an aumeen. \"The promise which\r\nhe [Nundcomar] says I made him, that he should be constituted aumeen,\r\nthat is, inquisitor-general over the whole country, and that I would\r\ndelegate to him my whole power and influence, is something more than a\r\nnegative falsehood.\" He justly and naturally reprobates the proposition\r\nof appointing an inquisitor-general over the whole country; and yet we\r\nsee him afterwards appointing Gunga Govind Sing such an\r\ninquisitor-general over the whole country, in order that a bega of land\r\nshould not escape him.\r\n\r\nLet us see how all this ended, and what it is that leads me directly to\r\nthe presumption of corruption against him in this wicked _aumeeny_\r\nscheme. Now I will admit the whole scheme to have been well intended, I\r\nwill forgive the letting all the lands of Bengal by public auction, I\r\nwill forgive all he has done with regard to his banians, I shall forgive\r\nhim even this commission itself, if he will show your Lordships that\r\nthere was the smallest use made of it with regard to the settlement of\r\nthe revenues of the Company. If there was not, then there is obviously\r\none use only that could be made of it, namely, to put all the people of\r\nthe whole country under obedience to Gunga Govind Sing. What, then, was\r\ndone? Titles and accounts were exacted; the estimate was made, acre by\r\nacre; but we have not been able to find one word on their records of any\r\nreturn that was made to the Company of this investigation, or of any\r\nsettlement or assessment of the country founded upon it, or of any\r\nregulation that was established upon it. Therefore, as an honest man,\r\nand as a man who is standing here for the Commons of Great Britain, I\r\nmust not give way to any idle doubts and ridiculous suppositions. I\r\ncannot, I say, entertain any doubts that the only purpose it was\r\ndesigned to answer was to subject the whole landed interest of the\r\ncountry to the cruel inquisition of Gunga Govind Sing, and to the cruel\r\npurposes of Mr. Hastings. Show me another purpose and I will give up the\r\nargument: for if there are two ways of accounting for the same act, it\r\nis possible it may be attributed to the better motive; but when we see\r\nthat a bad thing was done under pretence of some good, we must attach a\r\nbad motive to it, if the pretence be never fulfilled.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI have now done with the landed interest of Bengal. I have omitted much\r\nwhich might have been pressed upon your Lordships, not from any\r\nindisposition to remark upon the matter more fully, but because it has\r\nbeen done already by abler persons; I only wished to make some practical\r\ninferences, which, perhaps, in the hurry of my brother Managers, might\r\npossibly have escaped them; I wished to show you that one system of\r\nknown or justly presumed corruption pervades the whole of this business,\r\nfrom one end to the other. Having thus disposed of the native landed\r\ninterest, and the native zemindars or landholders of the country, I pass\r\nto the English government.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, when we have shown plainly the utter extinction of the native\r\nMahometan government, when we have shown the extinction of the native\r\nlanded interest, what hope can there be for that afflicted country but\r\nin the servants of the Company? When we have shown the corrupt state of\r\nthat service, what hope but from the Court of Directors, what hope but\r\nin the superintending control of British tribunals? I think as well of\r\nthe body of my countrymen as any man can do. I do not think that any man\r\nsent out to India is sent with an ill purpose, or goes out with bad\r\ndispositions. No: I think the young men who go there are fair and\r\nfaithful representatives of the people of the same age,--uncorrupted,\r\nbut corruptible from their age, as we all are. They are sent there\r\nyoung. There is but one thing held out to them,--\"You are going to make\r\nyour fortune.\" The Company's service is to be the restoration of decayed\r\nnoble families; it is to be the renovation of old, and the making of new\r\nones. Now, when such a set of young men are sent out with these hopes\r\nand views, and with little education, or a very imperfect one,--when\r\nthese people, from whatever rank of life selected, many from the best,\r\nmost from the middling, very few from the lowest, but, high, middling,\r\nor low, they are sent out to make two things coincide which the wit of\r\nman was never able to unite, to make their fortune and form their\r\neducation at once. What is the education of the generality of the world?\r\nReading a parcel of books? No. Restraint of discipline, emulation,\r\nexamples of virtues and of justice, form the education of the world. If\r\nthe Company's servants have not that education, and are left to give\r\nloose to their natural passions, some would be corrupt of course, and\r\nsome would be uncorrupt; but probably the majority of them would be\r\ninclined to pursue moderate courses between these two. Now I am to show\r\nyou that Mr. Hastings left these servants but this alternative: \"Be\r\nstarved, be depressed, be ruined, disappoint the hopes of your families,\r\nor be my slaves, be ready to be subservient to me in every iniquity I\r\nshall order you to commit, and to conceal everything I shall wish you to\r\nconceal.\" This was the state of the service. Therefore the Commons did\r\nwell and wisely, when they sent us here, not to attack this or that\r\nservant who may have peculated, but to punish the man who was sent to\r\nreform abuses, and to make Bengal furnish to the world a brilliant\r\nexample of British justice.\r\n\r\nI shall now proceed to state briefly the abuses of the Company's\r\ngovernment,--to show you what Mr. Hastings was expected to do for their\r\nreformation, and what he actually did do; I shall then show your\r\nLordships the effects of the whole.\r\n\r\nI shall begin by reading to your Lordships an extract from the\r\nDirectors' letter to Bengal, of the 10th April, 1773.\r\n\r\n     \"We wish we could refute the observation, that almost every attempt\r\n     made by us and our administrations at your Presidency for the\r\n     reforming of abuses has rather increased them, and added to the\r\n     miseries of the country we are so anxious to protect and cherish.\r\n     The truth of this observation appears fully in the late appointment\r\n     of supervisors and chiefs. Instituted as they were, to give relief\r\n     to the industrious tenants, to improve and enlarge our investments,\r\n     to destroy monopolies and retrench expenses, the end has by no\r\n     means been answerable to the institution. Are not the tenants more\r\n     than ever oppressed and wretched? Are our investments improved?\r\n     Have not the raw silk and cocoons been raised upon us fifty per\r\n     cent in price? We can hardly say what has not been made a monopoly.\r\n     And as to the expenses of your Presidency, they are at length\r\n     swelled to a degree we are no longer able to support. These facts\r\n     (for such they are) should have been stated to us as capital\r\n     reasons why neither our orders of 1771, nor indeed any regulations\r\n     whatever, could be carried into execution. But, perhaps, as this\r\n     would have proved too much, it was not suggested to us; for nothing\r\n     could more plainly indicate a state of anarchy, and that there was\r\n     no government existing in our servants in Bengal.\"\r\n\r\n     \"And therefore, when oppression pervades the whole country, when\r\n     youths have been suffered with impunity to exercise sovereign\r\n     jurisdiction over the natives, and to acquire rapid fortunes by\r\n     monopolizing of commerce, it cannot be a wonder to us or\r\n     yourselves, that dadney merchants do not come forward to contract\r\n     with the Company, that the manufactures find their way through\r\n     foreign channels, or that our investments are at once enormously\r\n     dear and of a debased quality.\r\n\r\n     \"It is evident that the evils which have been so destructive to us\r\n     lie too deep for any partial plans to reach or correct; it is\r\n     therefore our resolution to aim at the root of these evils: and we\r\n     are happy in having reason to believe that in every just and\r\n     necessary regulation we shall meet with the approbation and support\r\n     of the legislature, who consider the public as materially\r\n     interested in the Company's prosperity.\r\n\r\n     \"In order to effectuate this great end, the first step must be to\r\n     restore perfect obedience and due subordination to your\r\n     administration. Our Governor and Council must reassume and exercise\r\n     their delegated powers upon every just occasion,--punish\r\n     delinquents, cherish the meritorious, discountenance that luxury\r\n     and dissipation which, to the reproach of government, prevailed in\r\n     Bengal. Our President, Mr. Hastings, we trust, will set the example\r\n     of temperance, economy, and application; and upon this, we are\r\n     sensible, much will depend. And here we take occasion, to indulge\r\n     the pleasure we have in acknowledging Mr. Hastings's services upon\r\n     the coast of Coromandel, in constructing, with equal labor and\r\n     ability, the plan which has so much improved our investments there;\r\n     and as we are persuaded he will persevere in the same laudable\r\n     pursuit through every branch of our affairs in Bengal, he, in\r\n     return, may depend on the steady support and favor of his\r\n     employers.\r\n\r\n     \"Your settlement being thus put into a train of reform, (without\r\n     which, indeed, all regulations will prove ineffectual,) you are\r\n     next to revert to the old system, when the business of your\r\n     Presidency was principally performed by our own servants, who then\r\n     had knowledge of our investments, and every other department of our\r\n     concerns: you will therefore fill the several offices with the\r\n     factors and writers upon your establishment, (for, with our present\r\n     appointments, we are assured there will be sufficient for this\r\n     purpose,) and thus you will banish idleness, and its attendants,\r\n     extravagance and dissipation. And here we enjoin you to transmit to\r\n     us a faithful and minute state of the pay and every known\r\n     emolument of all below Council: for, as it is notorious that even\r\n     youths in our service expend in equipage, servants, dress, and\r\n     living infinitely more than our stated allowances can afford, we\r\n     cannot but be anxious to discover the means by which they are\r\n     enabled to proceed in this manner; and, indeed, so obnoxious is\r\n     this conduct to us, and so injurious in its consequences, that we\r\n     expect and require you to show your displeasure to all such as\r\n     shall transgress in this respect, contrasting it at the same time\r\n     with instances of kindness towards the sober, frugal, and\r\n     industrious.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, you see the state in which the Directors conceived the country\r\nto be. That it was in this state is not denied by Mr. Hastings, who was\r\nsent out for the purpose of reforming it. The Directors had swept away\r\nalmost the whole body of their Bengal servants for supposed corruption;\r\nand they appointed a set of new ones, to regenerate, as it were, the\r\ngovernment of that country.\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings says, \"I was brought to India like other people.\" This,\r\nindeed, is true; and I hope it will prove an example and instruction to\r\nall mankind never to employ a man who has been bred in base and corrupt\r\npractices, from any hope that his local knowledge may make him the\r\nfittest person to correct such practices. Mr. Hastings goes on to say,\r\nthat you could not expect more from him than could be done by a man bred\r\nup, as he was, in the common habits of the country. This is also true.\r\nMy Lords, you might as well expect a man to be fit for a perfumer's\r\nshop, who has lain a month in a pig's stye, as to expect that a man who\r\nhas been a contractor with the Company for a length of time is a fit\r\nperson for reforming abuses. Mr. Hastings has stated in general his\r\nhistory, his merits, and his services. We have looked over with care the\r\nrecords relative to his proceedings, and we find that in 1760 and 1761\r\nhe was in possession of a contract for bullocks and a contract for\r\nprovisions. It is no way wrong for any man to take a contract, provided\r\nhe does not do what Mr. Hastings has condemned in his\r\nregulations,--become a contractor with his masters. But though I do not\r\nbear upon Mr. Hastings for having spent his time in being a\r\nbullock-contractor, yet I say that he ought to have laid aside all the\r\nhabits of a bullock-contractor when he was made a great minister for the\r\nreformation of a great service full of abuses. I will show your\r\nLordships that he never did so; that, on the contrary, being bred in\r\nthose bad habits, and having had the education that I speak of, he\r\npersevered in the habits which had been formed in him to the very last.\r\n\r\nI understand it has been imputed as a sort of a crime in me, that I\r\nstated something of the obscurity of Mr. Hastings's birth. The\r\nimputation has no foundation. Can it be believed that any man could be\r\nso absurd as to attack a man's birth, when he is accusing his actions?\r\nNo, I have always spoken of the low, sordid, and mercenary habits in\r\nwhich he was bred; I said nothing of his birth. But, my Lords, I was a\r\ngood deal surprised when a friend of his and mine yesterday morning put\r\ninto my hands, who had been attacking Mr. Hastings's life and conduct, a\r\npedigree. I was appealing to the records of the Company; they answer by\r\nsending me to the Herald's Office. Many of your Lordships' pedigrees\r\nare obscure in comparison with that of Mr. Hastings; and I only wonder\r\nhow he came to derogate from such a line of nobles by becoming a\r\ncontractor for bullocks.\r\n\r\nA man may be an honest bullock-contractor, (God forbid that many of them\r\nin this country should not be very honest!) but I find his terms were\r\nnearly four times as high as those which the House of Commons had\r\ncondemned as exorbitant. They were not only unusually high, but the\r\nbullocks were badly supplied, and the contract had not been fairly\r\nadvertised. It was therefore agreed to declare the same void at the\r\nexpiration of twelve months, on the 1st December, 1763. I say again,\r\nthat I do not condemn him for being a bullock-contractor; but I am\r\nsuspicious of his honesty, because he has been nursed in bad and vicious\r\nhabits. That of contracting with his masters is a bad habit, as he\r\nhimself has stated in a record which is printed by the House of Commons.\r\nI condemn him for being a fraudulent bullock-contractor: for he was\r\nturned out of that contract for fraudulent practices; it was declared\r\nvoid, and given to another at a lower price. After it was so disposed\r\nof, Mr. Hastings himself, condemning his own original contract, which\r\nwas at twelve rupees for a certain species of bullocks, took the\r\ncontract again at seven; and on these terms it continued. What I\r\ntherefore contend for is this, that he carried with him the spirit of a\r\nfraudulent bullock-contractor through the whole of the Company's\r\nservice, in its greatest and most important parts.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, the wading through all these corruptions is an unpleasant\r\nemployment for me; but what am I to think of a man who holds up his\r\nhead so high, that, when a matter of account is in discussion, such as\r\nappears in this very defence that I have in my hand, he declares he does\r\nnot know anything about it? He cannot keep accounts: that is beneath\r\nhim. We trace him throughout the whole of his career engaged in a great\r\nvariety of mercantile employments; and yet, when he comes before you,\r\nyou would imagine that he had been bred in the study of the sublimest\r\nsciences, and had no concern in anything else,--that he had been engaged\r\nin writing a poem, an Iliad, or some work that might revive fallen\r\nliterature. There is but one exception to his abhorrence of accounts: he\r\nalways contrives to make up a good account for himself.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, we have read to you a letter in which the Court of Directors\r\nhave described the disorders of their service, the utter ruin of it, the\r\ncorruption that prevailed in it, and the destruction of the country by\r\nit. When we are said to exaggerate, we use no stronger words than they\r\ndo. We cannot mince the matter; your Lordships should not mince it; no\r\nlittle paltry delicacies should hinder you, when there is a country\r\nexpiring under all these things, from calling the authors to a strict\r\naccount. The Court of Directors sent him that statement; they\r\nrecommended to him a radical reformation. What does he do? We will read\r\nhis letter of 1773, in which you will find seeds sown for the\r\npropagation of all those future abuses which terminated in the utter and\r\nirremediable destruction of the whole service. After he has praised the\r\nDirectors for the trust that they had placed in him, after expressing\r\nhis highest gratitude, and so on, he says,--\r\n\r\n     \"While I indulge the pleasure which I receive from the past\r\n     successes of my endeavors, I own I cannot refrain from looking back\r\n     with a mixture of anxiety on the omissions by which I am sensible I\r\n     may since have hazarded the diminution of your esteem. All my\r\n     letters addressed to your Honorable Court, and to the Secret\r\n     Committee, repeat the strongest promises of prosecuting the\r\n     inquiries into the conduct of your servants, which you have been\r\n     pleased to commit particularly to my charge. You will readily\r\n     perceive that I must have been sincere in those declarations; since\r\n     it would have argued great indiscretion to have made them, had I\r\n     foreseen my inability to perform them. I find myself now under the\r\n     disagreeable necessity of avowing that inability; at the same time\r\n     I will boldly take upon me to affirm, that, on whomsoever you might\r\n     have delegated that charge, and by whatever powers it might have\r\n     been accompanied, it would have been sufficient to occupy the\r\n     entire attention of those who were intrusted with it, and, even\r\n     with all the aids of leisure and authority, would have proved\r\n     ineffectual. I dare appeal to the public records, to the testimony\r\n     of those who have opportunities of knowing me, and even to the\r\n     detail which the public voice can report of the past acts of this\r\n     government, that my time has been neither idly nor uselessly\r\n     employed; yet such are the cares and embarrassments of this various\r\n     state, that, although much may be done, much more, even in matters\r\n     of moment, must necessarily remain neglected. To select from the\r\n     miscellaneous heap which each day's exigencies present to our\r\n     choice those points on which the general welfare of your affairs\r\n     most essentially depends, to provide expedients for future\r\n     advantages, and guard against probable evils, are all that your\r\n     administration can faithfully promise to perform for your service,\r\n     with their united labors most diligently exerted. They cannot look\r\n     back without sacrificing the objects of their immediate duty, which\r\n     are those of your interest, to endless researches, which can\r\n     produce no real good, and may expose your affairs to all the\r\n     ruinous consequences of personal malevolence, both here and at\r\n     home.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, you see here, that, after admitting that he has promised to\r\nthe Court of Directors to do what they ordered him to do, (and he had\r\npromised to make a radical reform in their whole service, and to cure\r\nthose abuses which they have stated,) he declares that he will not\r\nexecute them; he pleads a variety of other occupations; but as to that\r\ngreat fundamental grievance he was appointed to eradicate, he declares\r\nhe will not even attempt it. \"Why did you promise?\"--it naturally occurs\r\nto ask him that question. \"Why,\" says he, \"you will readily perceive\r\nthat I must have been sincere in those declarations; since it would\r\nhave argued great indiscretion to have made them, had I known my\r\ninability to perform them.\" This is a kind of argument that belongs to\r\nMr. Hastings exclusively. Most other people would say, \"You may judge of\r\nthe sincerity of my promises by my zeal in the performance\"; but he\r\nsays, \"You may judge of the sincerity of my promises, because I would\r\nnot promise, if I had not thought I should be able to perform.\" It runs\r\nin this ridiculous circle: \"I promised to obey the Court of Directors;\r\ntherefore I knew that I could obey them: but I could not obey them;\r\ntherefore I was absolved from my promise, and did not attempt to obey\r\nthem.\" In fact, there is not so much as one grievance or abuse in the\r\ncountry, that he reformed. And this was systematical in Mr. Hastings's\r\nconduct,--that he was resolved to connive at the whole of the iniquities\r\nof the service, because he was resolved that every one of those existing\r\niniquities should be practised by himself. \"But,\" says he, \"the\r\nreformation required can produce no real good, and may expose your\r\naffairs to all the ruinous consequences of personal malevolence, both\r\nhere and at home.\" This he gives you as a reason why he will not\r\nprosecute the inquiry into abuses abroad,--because he is afraid that you\r\nshould punish him at home for doing his duty abroad,--that it will\r\nexpose him to malevolence at home; and therefore, to avoid being subject\r\nto malevolence at home, he would not do his duty abroad.\r\n\r\nHe follows this with something that is perfectly extraordinary: he\r\ndesires, instead of doing his duty, which he declares it is impossible\r\nto do, that he may be invested with an arbitrary power. I refer your\r\nLordships to pages 2827, 2828, and 2829 of the printed Minutes, where\r\nyou will find the system of his government to be formed upon a\r\nresolution not to use any one legal means of punishing corruption, or\r\nfor the prevention of corruption; all that he desires is, to have an\r\nabsolute arbitrary power over the servants of the Company. There you\r\nwill see that arbitrary power for corrupt purposes over the servants of\r\nthe Company is the foundation of every part of his whole conduct. Remark\r\nwhat he says here, and then judge whether these inferences are to be\r\neluded by any chicane.\r\n\r\n     \"In the charge of oppression, although supported by the cries of\r\n     the people and the most authentic representations, it is yet\r\n     impossible, in most cases, to obtain legal proofs of it; and unless\r\n     the discretionary power which I have recommended be somewhere\r\n     lodged, the assurance of impunity from any formal inquiry will\r\n     baffle every order of the board; as, on the other hand, the fear of\r\n     the consequences will restrain every man within the bounds of his\r\n     duty, if he knows himself liable to suffer by the effects of a\r\n     single control.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, you see two things most material for you to consider in the\r\njudgment of this great cause, which is the cause of nations. The first\r\nthing for you to consider is the declaration of the culprit at your bar,\r\nthat a person may be pursued by the cries of a whole people,--that\r\ndocuments the most authentic and satisfactory, but deficient in\r\ntechnical form, may be produced against him,--in short, that he may be\r\nguilty of the most enormous crimes,--and yet that legal proofs may be\r\nwanting. This shows you how seriously you ought to consider, before you\r\nreject any proof upon the idea that it is not technical legal proof. To\r\nthis assertion of Mr. Hastings I oppose, however, the opinion of a\r\ngentleman who sits near his side, Mr. Sumner, which is much more\r\nprobable.\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings says, that the power of the Council is not effectual\r\nagainst the inferior servants, that [it?] is too weak to coerce them.\r\nWith much more truth Mr. Sumner has said, in his minute, you might\r\neasily coerce the inferior servants, but that the dread of falling upon\r\npersons in high stations discourages and puts an end to complaint. I\r\nquote the recorded authority of the gentleman near him, as being of\r\ngreat weight in the affairs of the Company, to prove what is infinitely\r\nmore probable, the falsehood of Mr. Hastings's assertion, that an\r\ninferior servant cannot be coerced, and that they must riot with\r\nimpunity in the spoils of the people.\r\n\r\nBut we will go to a much more serious part of the business. After\r\ndesiring arbitrary power in this letter, he desires a perpetuation of\r\nit. And here he has given you a description of a bad Governor, to which\r\nI must call your attention, as your Lordships will find it, in every\r\npart of his proceeding, to be exactly applicable to himself and to his\r\nown government.\r\n\r\n     \"The first command of a state so extensive as that of Bengal is not\r\n     without opportunities of private emoluments; and although the\r\n     allowance which your bounty has liberally provided for your\r\n     servants may be reasonably expected to fix the bounds of their\r\n     desires, yet you will find it extremely difficult to restrain men\r\n     from profiting by other means, who look upon their appointment as\r\n     the measure of a day, and who, from the uncertainty of their\r\n     condition, see no room for any acquisition but of wealth, since\r\n     reputation and the consequences which follow the successful conduct\r\n     of great affairs are only to be attained in a course of years.\r\n     Under such circumstances, however rigid your orders may be, or\r\n     however supported, I am afraid that in most instances they will\r\n     produce no other fruits than either avowed disobedience or the\r\n     worst extreme of falsehood and hypocrisy. These are not the\r\n     principles which should rule the conduct of men whom you have\r\n     constituted the guardians of your property, and checks on the\r\n     morals and fidelity of others. The care of self-preservation will\r\n     naturally suggest the necessity of seizing the opportunity of\r\n     present power, when the duration of it is considered as limited to\r\n     the usual term of three years, and of applying it to the provision\r\n     of a future independency; therefore every renewal of this term is\r\n     liable to prove a reiterated oppression. It is perhaps owing to the\r\n     causes which I have described, and a proof of their existence, that\r\n     this appointment has been for some years past so eagerly solicited\r\n     and so easily resigned. There are yet other inconveniences\r\n     attendant on this habit, and perhaps an investigation of them all\r\n     would lead to endless discoveries. Every man whom your choice has\r\n     honored with so distinguished a trust seeks to merit approbation\r\n     and acquire an _éclat_ by innovations, for which the wild scene\r\n     before him affords ample and justifiable occasion.\"\r\n\r\nYou see, my Lords, he has stated, that, if a Governor is appointed to\r\nhold his office only for a short time, the consequence would be either\r\nan avowed disobedience, or, what is worse, extreme falsehood and\r\nhypocrisy. Your Lordships know that this man has held his office for a\r\nlong time, and yet his disobedience has been avowed, and his hypocrisy\r\nand his falsehood have been discovered, and have been proved to your\r\nLordships in the course of this trial. You see this man has declared\r\nwhat are the principles which should rule the conduct of men whom you\r\nhave constituted the guardians of your property, and checks upon the\r\nmorals and fidelity of others. Mr. Hastings tells you himself directly\r\nwhat his duty was; he tells you himself, and he pronounces his own\r\ncondemnation, what was expected from him, namely, that he should give a\r\ngreat example himself, and be a check and guardian of the fidelity of\r\nall that are under him. He declares, at the end of this letter, that a\r\nvery short continuance in their service would enable him to make a\r\nfortune up to the height of his desire. He has since thought proper to\r\ndeclare to you that he is a beggar and undone, notwithstanding all his\r\nirregular resources in that very service.\r\n\r\nI have read this letter to your Lordships, that you may contrast it with\r\nthe conduct of the prisoner, as stated by us, and proved by the evidence\r\nwe have adduced. We have stated and proved that Mr. Hastings did enter\r\nupon a systematic connivance at the peculation of the Company's\r\nservants, that he refused to institute any check whatever for the\r\npurpose of preventing corruption, and that he carried into execution no\r\none measure of government agreeably to the positive and solemn\r\nengagements into which he had entered with the Directors. We therefore\r\ncharge him, not only with his own corruptions, but with a systematic,\r\npremeditated corruption of the whole service, from the time when he was\r\nappointed, in the beginning of the year 1772, down to the year 1785,\r\nwhen he left it. He never attempted to detect any one single abuse\r\nwhatever; he never endeavored once to put a stop to any corruption in\r\nany man, black or white, in any way whatever. And thus he has acted in a\r\ngovernment of which he himself declares the nature to be such that it is\r\nalmost impossible so to detect misconduct as to give legal evidence of\r\nit, though a man should be declared by the cries of the whole people to\r\nbe guilty.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, he desires an arbitrary power over the Company's servants to\r\nbe given to him. God forbid arbitrary power should be given into the\r\nhands of any man! At the same time, God forbid, if by power be meant the\r\nability to discover, to reach, to check, and to punish subordinate\r\ncorruption, that he should not be enabled so to do, and to get at, to\r\nprosecute, and punish delinquency by law! But honesty only, and not\r\narbitrary power, is necessary for that purpose. We well know, indeed,\r\nthat a government requiring arbitrary power has been the situation in\r\nwhich this man has attempted to place us.\r\n\r\nWe know, also, my Lords, that there are cases in which the act of the\r\ndelinquent may be of consequence, while the example of the criminal,\r\nfrom the obscurity of his situation, is of little importance: in other\r\ncases, the act of the delinquent may be of no great importance, but the\r\nconsequences of the example dreadful. We know that crimes of great\r\nmagnitude, that acts of great tyranny, can but seldom be exercised, and\r\nonly by a few persons. They are privileged crimes. They are the dreadful\r\nprerogatives of greatness, and of the highest situations only. But when\r\na Governor-General descends into the muck and filth of peculation and\r\ncorruption, when he receives bribes and extorts money, he does acts that\r\nare imitable by everybody. There is not a single man, black or white,\r\nfrom the highest to the lowest, that is possessed in the smallest degree\r\nof momentary authority, that cannot imitate the acts of such a\r\nGovernor-General. Consider, then, what the consequences will be, when it\r\nis laid down as a principle of the service, that no man is to be called\r\nto account according to the existing laws, and that you must either\r\ngive, as he says, arbitrary power, or suffer your government to be\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nWe asked Mr. Anderson, whether the covenant of every farmer of the\r\nrevenue did not forbid him from giving any presents to any persons, or\r\ntaking any. He answered, he did not exactly remember, (for the memory of\r\nthis gentleman is very indifferent, though the matter was in his own\r\nparticular province,) but he thought it did; and he referred us to the\r\nrecord of it. I cannot get at the record; and therefore you must take it\r\nas it stands from Mr. Anderson, without a reference to the record,--that\r\nthe farmers were forbidden to take or give any money to any person\r\nwhatever, beyond their engagements. Now, if a Governor-General comes to\r\nthat farmer, and says, \"You must give a certain sum beyond your\r\nengagements,\" he lets him loose to prey upon the landholders and\r\ncultivators; and thus a way is prepared for the final desolation of the\r\nwhole country, by the malversation of the Governor, and by the\r\nconsequent oppressive conduct of the farmers.\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings being now put over the whole country to regulate it, let us\r\nsee what he has done. He says, \"Let me have an arbitrary power, and I\r\nwill regulate it.\" He assumed arbitrary power, and turned in and out\r\nevery servant at his pleasure. But did he by that arbitrary power\r\ncorrect any one corruption? Indeed, how could he? He does not say he\r\ndid. For when a man gives ill examples in himself, when he cannot set on\r\nfoot an inquiry that does not terminate in his own corruption, of course\r\nhe cannot institute any inquiry into the corruption of the other\r\nservants.\r\n\r\nBut again, my Lords, the subordinate servant will say, \"I cannot rise\"\r\n(properly here, as Mr. Hastings has well observed) \"to the height of\r\ngreatness, power, distinction, rank, or honor in the government; but I\r\ncan make my fortune, according to my degree, my measure, and my place.\"\r\nHis views will be then directed so to make it. And when he sees that the\r\nGovernor-General is actuated by no other views,--when he himself, as a\r\nfarmer, is confidently assured of the corruptions of his superior,--when\r\nhe knows it to be laid down as a principle by the Governor-General, that\r\nno corruption is to be inquired into, and that, if it be not expressly\r\nlaid down, yet that his conduct is such as to make it the same as if he\r\nhad actually so laid it down,--then, I say, every part of the service is\r\ninstantly and totally corrupted.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI shall next refer your Lordships to the article of contracts. Five\r\ncontracts have been laid before you, the extravagant and corrupt profits\r\nof which have been proved to amount to 500,000_l._ We have shown you, by\r\nthe strongest presumptive evidence, that these contracts were given for\r\nthe purpose of corrupting the Company's servants in India, and of\r\ncorrupting the Company itself in England. You will recollect that\r\n40,000_l._ was given in one morning for a contract which the contractor\r\nwas never to execute: I speak of Mr. Sulivan's contract. You will also\r\nrecollect that he was the son of the principal person in the Indian\r\ndirection, and who, in or out of office, was known to govern it, and to\r\nbe supported by the whole Indian interest of Mr. Hastings. You have seen\r\nthe corruption of Sir Eyre Coote, in giving to Mr. Croftes the bullock\r\ncontract. You have seen the bullock contracts stated to Mr. Hastings's\r\nface, and not denied, to have been made for concealing a number of\r\ncorrupt interests. You have seen Mr. Auriol's contract, given to the\r\nsecretary of the Company by Mr. Hastings in order that he might have the\r\nwhole records and registers of the Company under his control. You have\r\nseen that the contract and commission for the purchase of stores and\r\nprovisions, an enormous job, was given to Mr. Belli, an obscure man, for\r\nwhom Mr. Hastings offers himself as security, under circumstances that\r\nwent to prove that Mr. Belli held this commission for Mr. Hastings.\r\nThese, my Lords, are things that cannot be slurred over. The\r\nGovernor-General is corrupt; he corrupts all about him; he does it upon\r\nsystem; he will make no inquiry.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, I have stated the amount of the sums which he has squandered\r\naway in these contracts; but you will observe that we have brought\r\nforward but five of them. Good God! when you consider the magnitude and\r\nmultiplicity of the Company's dealings, judge you what must be the\r\nenormous mass of that corruption of which he has been the cause, and in\r\nthe profits of which he has partaken. When your Lordships shall have\r\nconsidered this document, his defence, which I have read in part to you,\r\nsee whether you are not bound, when he imputes to us and throws upon us\r\nthe cause of all his corruption, to throw back the charge by your\r\ndecision, and hurl it with indignation upon himself.\r\n\r\nBut there is another shameless and most iniquitous circumstance, which I\r\nhave forgotten to mention, respecting these contracts. He not only\r\nconsidered them as means of present power, and therefore protected his\r\nfavorites without the least inquiry into their conduct, and with\r\nflagrant suspicion of a corrupt participation in their delinquency, but\r\nhe goes still farther: he declares, that, if he should be removed from\r\nhis government, he will give them a lease in these exorbitant profits,\r\nfor the purpose of securing a corrupt party to support and bear him out\r\nby their evidence, upon the event of any inquiry into his conduct,--to\r\ngive him a _razinama_, to give him a flourishing character, whenever he\r\nshould come upon his trial. Hear what his principles are; hear what the\r\nman himself avows.\r\n\r\n        \"_Fort William, October 4, 1779._\r\n\r\n     \"In answer to Mr. Francis's insinuation, that it is natural enough\r\n     for the agent to wish to secure himself before the expiration of\r\n     the present government, I avow the fact as to myself as well as the\r\n     agent. When I see a systematic opposition to every measure proposed\r\n     by me for the service of the public, by which an individual may\r\n     eventually benefit, I cannot hesitate a moment to declare it to be\r\n     my firm belief, that, should the government of this country be\r\n     placed in the hands of the present minority, they would seek the\r\n     ruin of every man connected with me; it is therefore only an act\r\n     of common justice in me to wish to secure them, as far as I legally\r\n     can, from the apprehension of future oppression.\"\r\n\r\nHere is the principle avowed. He takes for granted, and he gives it the\r\nname of oppression, that the person who should succeed him would take\r\naway those unlawful and wicked emoluments, and give them to some other.\r\n\"But,\" says he, \"I will put out of the Company's power the very means\r\nof redress.\"\r\n\r\nThe document which I am now going to read to your Lordships contains a\r\ndeclaration by Mr. Hastings of another mean which he used of corrupting\r\nthe whole Company's service.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Minute of the Governor-General.--Extract from that Minute._\r\n\r\n     \"Called upon continually by persons of high rank and station, both\r\n     in national and in the Company's councils, to protect and prefer\r\n     their friends in the army, and by the merits and services which\r\n     have come under my personal knowledge and observation, I suffer\r\n     both pain and humiliation at the want of power to reward the\r\n     meritorious, or to show a proper attention to the wishes of my\r\n     superiors, without having recourse to means which must be\r\n     considered as incompatible with the dignity of my station. The\r\n     slender relief which I entreat of the board from this state of\r\n     mortification is the authority to augment the number of my staff,\r\n     which will enable me to show a marked and particular attention in\r\n     circumstances such as above stated, and will be no considerable\r\n     burden to the Company.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, you here see what he has been endeavoring to effect, for the\r\nexpress purpose of enabling him to secure himself a corrupt influence in\r\nEngland. But there is another point much more material, which brings the\r\nmatter directly home to this court, and puts it to you either to punish\r\nhim or to declare yourselves to be accomplices in the corruption of the\r\nwhole service. Hear what the man himself says. I am first to mention to\r\nyour Lordships the occasion upon which the passage which I shall read to\r\nyou was written. It was when he was making his enormous and shameful\r\nestablishment of a Revenue Board, in the year 1781,--of which I shall\r\nsay a few words hereafter, as being a gross abuse in itself: he then\r\nfelt that the world would be so much shocked at the enormous prodigality\r\nand corrupt profusion of what he was doing, that he at last spoke out\r\nplainly.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _A Minute of Mr. Hastings, transmitted in a Letter by Mr. Wheler._\r\n\r\n     \"In this, as it must be the case in every reformation, the interest\r\n     of individuals has been our principal, if not our only impediment.\r\n     We could not at once deprive so large a body of our fellow-servants\r\n     of their bread, without feeling that reluctance which humanity must\r\n     dictate,--not unaccompanied, perhaps, with some concern for the\r\n     consequence which our own credit might suffer by an act which\r\n     involved the fortunes of many, and extended its influence to all\r\n     their connections. This, added to the justice which was due to your\r\n     servants, who were removed for no fault of theirs, but for the\r\n     public convenience, induced us to continue their allowances until\r\n     other offices could be provided for them, and the more cheerfully\r\n     to submit to the expediency of leaving others in a temporary or\r\n     partial charge of the internal collections. In effect, the civil\r\n     officers [offices?] of this government might be reduced to a very\r\n     scanty number, were their exigency alone to determine the list of\r\n     your covenanted servants, which at this time consist of no less a\r\n     number than two hundred and fifty-two,--many of them the sons of\r\n     the first families in the kingdom of Great Britain, and every one\r\n     aspiring to the rapid acquisition of lacs, and to return to pass\r\n     the prime of their lives at home, as multitudes have done before\r\n     them. Neither will the revenues of this country suffice for such\r\n     boundless pretensions, nor are they compatible with yours and the\r\n     national interests, which may eventually suffer as certain a ruin\r\n     from the effects of private competition and the claims of patronage\r\n     as from the more dreaded calamities of war, or the other ordinary\r\n     causes which lead to the decline of dominion.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, you have here his declaration, that patronage, which he avows\r\nto be one of the principles of his government, and to be the principle\r\nof the last of his acts, is worse than war, pestilence, and famine,--and\r\nthat all these calamities together might not be so effectual as this\r\npatronage in wasting and destroying the country. And at what time does\r\nhe tell you this? He tells it you when he himself had just wantonly\r\ndestroyed an old regular establishment for the purpose of creating a new\r\none, in which he says he was under the necessity of pensioning the\r\nmembers of the old establishment from motives of mere humanity. He here\r\nconfesses himself to be the author of the whole mischief. \"I could,\"\r\nsays he, \"have acted better; I might have avoided desolating the country\r\nby peculation; but,\" says he, \"I had sons of the first families in the\r\nkingdom of Great Britain, every one aspiring to the rapid acquisition of\r\nlacs, and this would not suffer me to do my duty.\" I hope your Lordships\r\nwill stigmatize the falsehood of this assertion. Consider, my Lords,\r\nwhat he has said,--two hundred and fifty men at once, and in\r\nsuccession, aspiring to come home in the prime of their youth with\r\n_lacs_. You cannot take _lacs_ to be less than two; we cannot make a\r\nplural less than two. Two lacs make 20,000_l._ Then multiply that, by\r\n252, and you will find more than 2,500,000_l._ to be provided for that\r\nset of gentlemen, and for the claims of patronage. Undoubtedly such a\r\npatronage is worse than the most dreadful calamities of war, and all the\r\nother causes which lead to decline of dominion.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, I beseech you to consider this plan of corrupting the\r\nCompany's servants, beginning with systematical corruption, and ending\r\nwith an avowed declaration that he will persist in this iniquitous\r\nproceeding, and to the utmost of his power entail it upon the Company,\r\nfor the purpose of securing his accomplices against all the consequences\r\nof any change in the Company's government. \"I dare not,\" says he, \"be\r\nhonest: if I make their fortunes, you will judge favorably of me; if I\r\ndo not make their fortunes, I shall find myself crushed with a load of\r\nreproach and obloquy, from which I cannot escape in any other way than\r\nby bribing the House of Peers.\" What a shameful avowal this to be made\r\nin the face of the world! Your Lordships' judgment upon this great cause\r\nwill obliterate it from the memory of man.\r\n\r\nBut his apprehension of some change in the Company's government is not\r\nhis only pretext for some of these corrupt proceedings; he adverts also\r\nto the opposition which he had to encounter with his colleagues, as\r\nanother circumstance which drove him to adopt others of these scandalous\r\nexpediences. Now there was a period when he had no longer to contend\r\nwith, or to fear, that opposition.\r\n\r\nWhen he had got rid of the majority in the Council, which thwarted him,\r\nwhat did he do? Did he himself correct any of the evils and disorders\r\nwhich had prevailed in the service, and which his hostile majority had\r\npurposed to reform? No, not one,--notwithstanding the Court of Directors\r\nhad supported the majority in all their declarations, and had accused\r\nhim of corruption and rebellion in every part of his opposition to them.\r\nNow that he was free from the yoke of all the mischief of that cursed\r\nmajority which he deprecates, and which I have heard certain persons\r\nconsider as a great calamity, (a calamity indeed it was to\r\npatronage,)--as soon, I say, as he was free from this, you would imagine\r\nhe had undertaken some great and capital reformation; for all the power\r\nwhich the Company could give was in his hands,--total, absolute, and\r\nunconfined.\r\n\r\nI must here remind your Lordships, that the Provincial Councils was an\r\nestablishment made by Mr. Hastings. So confident was he in his own\r\nopinion of the expediency of them, that he transmitted to the Court of\r\nDirectors a draught of an act of Parliament to confirm them. By this act\r\nit was his intention to place them beyond the possibility of mutation.\r\nWhatever opinion others might entertain of their weakness, inefficacy,\r\nor other defects, Mr. Hastings found no such things in them. He had\r\ndeclared in the beginning that he considered them as a sort of\r\nexperiment, but that in the progress he found them answer so perfectly\r\nwell that he proposed even an act of Parliament to support them. The\r\nCourt of Directors, knowing the mischiefs that innovation had produced\r\nin their service, and the desolations which it had brought on the\r\ncountry, commanded him not to take any step for changing them, without\r\ntheir orders. Contrary, however, to his own declarations, contrary to\r\nthe sketch of an act of Parliament, which, for aught he knew, the\r\nlegislature might then have passed, (I know that it was in contemplation\r\nto pass, about that time, several acts for regulating the Company's\r\naffairs, and, for one, I should have been, as I always have been, a good\r\ndeal concerned in whatever tended to fix some kind of permanent and\r\nsettled government in Bengal,)--in violation, I say, of his duty, and in\r\ncontradiction to his own opinion, he at that time, without giving the\r\nparties notice, turns out of their employments, situations, and bread,\r\nthe Provincial Councils.\r\n\r\nAnd who were the members of those Provincial Councils? They were of high\r\nrank in the Company's service; they were not junior servants, boys of a\r\nday, but persons who had gone through some probation, who knew something\r\nof the country, who were conversant in its revenues and in the course of\r\nits business; they were, in short, men of considerable rank in the\r\nCompany's service. What did he do with these people? Without any regard\r\nto their rank in the service,--no more than he had regarded the rank of\r\nthe nobility of the country,--he sweeps them all, in one day, from their\r\nindependent situations, without reference to the Directors, and turns\r\nthem all into pensioners upon the Company. And for what purpose was this\r\ndone? It was done in order to reduce the Company's servants, who, in\r\ntheir independent situations, were too great a mass and volume for him\r\nto corrupt, to an abject dependence upon his absolute power. It was,\r\nthat he might tell them, \"You have lost your situations; you have\r\nnothing but small alimentary pensions, nothing more than a maintenance;\r\nand you must depend upon me whether you are to have anything more or\r\nnot.\" Thus at one stroke a large division of the Company's servants, and\r\none of the highest orders of them, were reduced, for their next bread,\r\nto an absolute, submissive dependence upon his will; and the Company was\r\nloaded with the pensions of all these discarded servants. Thus were\r\npersons in an honorable, independent situation, earned by long service\r\nin that country, and who were subject to punishment for their crimes, if\r\nproved against them, all deprived, unheard, of their employments. You\r\nwould imagine that Mr. Hastings had at least charged them with\r\ncorruption. No, you will see upon your minutes, that, when he abolished\r\nthe Provincial Councils, he declared at the same time that he found no\r\nfault with the persons concerned in them.\r\n\r\nThus, then, he has got rid, as your Lordships see, of one whole body of\r\nthe Company's servants; he has systematically corrupted the rest, and\r\nprovided, as far as lay in his power, for the perpetuation of their\r\ncorruption; he has connived at all their delinquencies, and has\r\ndestroyed the independence of all the superior orders of them.\r\n\r\nNow hear what he does with regard to the Council-General itself. They\r\nhad, by the act that made Mr. Hastings Governor, the management of the\r\nrevenues vested in them. You have been shown by an honorable and able\r\nfellow Manager of mine, that he took the business of this department\r\nwholly out of the hand of the Council; that he named a committee for\r\nthe management of it, at an enormous expense,--committee made up of his\r\nown creatures and dependants; and that, after destroying the Provincial\r\nCouncils, he brought down the whole management of the revenue to\r\nCalcutta. This committee took this important business entirely out of\r\nthe hands of the Council, in which the act had vested it, and this\r\ncommittee he formed without the orders of the Court of Directors, and\r\ndirectly contrary to the act, which put the superintendence in the hands\r\nof the Council.\r\n\r\nOh, but he reserved a superintendence over them.--You shall hear what\r\nthe superintendence was; you shall see, feel, smell, touch; it shall\r\nenter into every avenue and pore of your soul. It will show you what was\r\nthe real principle of Mr. Hastings's government. We will read to you\r\nwhat Sir John Shore says of that institution, and of the only ends and\r\npurposes which it could answer; your Lordships will then see how far he\r\nwas justifiable in violating an act of Parliament, and giving out of the\r\nCouncil's hands the great trust which the laws of his country had vested\r\nin them. It is part of a paper written in 1785 by Mr. Shore, who was\r\nsole acting president of this committee to which all Bengal was\r\ndelivered. He was an old servant of the Company, and he is now at the\r\nhead of the government of that country. He was Mr. Hastings's particular\r\nfriend, and therefore you cannot doubt either of his being a competent\r\nevidence, or that he is a favorable evidence for Mr. Hastings, and that\r\nhe would not say one word against the establishment of which he himself\r\nwas at the head, that was not perfectly true, and forced out of him by\r\nthe truth of the case. There is not a single part of it that does not\r\npoint out some abuse.\r\n\r\n     \"In the actual collection of the revenues, nothing is more\r\n     necessary than to give immediate attention to all complaints, which\r\n     are preferred daily without number, and to dispatch them in a\r\n     summary manner. This cannot be done where the control is remote. In\r\n     every purgunnah throughout Bengal there are some distinct usages,\r\n     which cannot be clearly known at a distance; yet in all complaints\r\n     of oppression or extortion, these must be known before a decision\r\n     can be pronounced. But to learn at Calcutta the particular customs\r\n     of a district of Rajeshahye or Dacca is almost impossible; and\r\n     considering the channel through which an explanation must pass, and\r\n     through which the complaint is made, any coloring may be given to\r\n     it, and oppression and extortion, to the ruin of a district, may be\r\n     practised with impunity. This is a continual source of\r\n     embarrassment to the Committee of Revenue in Calcutta.\r\n\r\n     \"One object of their institution was to bring the revenues without\r\n     the expenses of agency to the Presidency, and to remove all local\r\n     control over the farmers, who were to pay their rents at Calcutta.\r\n     When complaints are made against farmers by the occupiers of the\r\n     lands, it is almost impossible to discriminate truth from\r\n     falsehood; but to prevent a failure in the revenue, it is found\r\n     necessary, in all doubtful cases, to support the farmer,--a\r\n     circumstance which may give rise to and confirm the most cruel acts\r\n     of oppression. The real state of any district cannot be known by\r\n     the Committee. An occupier or zemindar may plead, that an\r\n     inundation has ruined him, or that his country is a desert through\r\n     want of rain. An aumeen is sent to examine the complaint. He\r\n     returns with an exaggerated account of losses, proved in volumes of\r\n     intricate accounts, which the Committee have no time to read, and\r\n     for which the aumeen is well paid. Possibly, however, the whole\r\n     account is false. Suppose no aumeen is employed, and the renter is\r\n     held to the tenor of his engagement, the loss, if real, must\r\n     occasion his ruin, unless his assessment is very moderate indeed.\r\n\r\n     \"I may venture to pronounce that the real state of the districts is\r\n     now less known, and the revenue less understood, than in the year\r\n     1774. Since the natives have had the disposal of accounts, since\r\n     they have been introduced as agents and trusted with authority,\r\n     intricacy and confusion have taken place. The records and accounts\r\n     which have been compiled are numerous, yet, when any particular\r\n     account is wanted, it cannot be found. It is the business of all,\r\n     from the ryots to the dewan, to conceal and deceive. The simplest\r\n     matters of fact are designedly covered with a veil through which no\r\n     human understanding can penetrate.\r\n\r\n     \"With respect to the present Committee of Revenue, it is morally\r\n     impossible for them to execute the business they are intrusted\r\n     with. They are invested with a general control, and they have an\r\n     executive authority larger than ever was before given to any board\r\n     or body of men. They may and must get through the business; but to\r\n     pretend to assert that they really execute it would be folly and\r\n     falsehood.\r\n\r\n     \"The grand object of the native dewannies was to acquire\r\n     independent control, and for many years they have pursued this\r\n     with wonderful art. The farmers and zemindars under the Committee\r\n     prosecute the same plan, and have already objections to anything\r\n     that has the least appearance of restriction. All control removed,\r\n     they can plunder as they please.\r\n\r\n     \"The Committee must have a dewan, or executive officer, call him by\r\n     what name you please. This man, in fact, has all the revenues paid\r\n     at the Presidency at his disposal, and can, if he has any\r\n     abilities, bring all the renters under contribution. It is of\r\n     little advantage to restrain the Committee themselves from bribery\r\n     or corruption, when their executive officer has the power of\r\n     protecting [practising?] both undetected.\r\n\r\n     \"To display the arts employed by a native on such an occasion would\r\n     fill a volume. He discovers the secret resources of the zemindars\r\n     and renters, their enemies and competitors, and by the engines of\r\n     hope and fear raised upon these foundations he can work them to his\r\n     purpose. The Committee, with the best intentions, best abilities,\r\n     and steadiest application, must, after all, be a tool in the hand\r\n     of their dewan.\"\r\n\r\nHere is the account of Mr. Hastings's new Committee of Revenue,\r\nsubstituted in the place of an establishment made by act of Parliament.\r\nHere is what he has substituted for Provincial Councils. Here is what he\r\nhas substituted in the room of the whole regular order of the service,\r\nwhich he totally subverted. Can we add anything to this picture? Can we\r\nheighten it? Can we do anything more than to recommend it to your\r\nLordships' serious consideration?\r\n\r\nBut before I finally dismiss this part of our charge, I must request\r\nyour Lordships' most earnest attention to the true character of these\r\natrocious proceedings, as they now stand proved before you, by direct or\r\nthe strongest presumptive evidence, upon the Company's records, and by\r\nhis own confessions and declarations, and those of his most intimate\r\nfriends and avowed agents.\r\n\r\nYour Lordships will recollect, that, previously to the appointment of\r\nMr. Hastings to be the Governor-General, in 1772, the collection of the\r\nrevenues was committed to a naib dewan, or native collector, under the\r\ncontrol of the Supreme Council,--and that Mr. Hastings did at that time,\r\nand upon various occasions afterwards, declare it to be his decided and\r\nfixed opinion, that nothing would be so detrimental to the interests of\r\nthe Company, and to the happiness and welfare of the inhabitants of\r\ntheir provinces, as changes, and more especially sudden changes, in the\r\ncollection of their revenues. His opinion was also most strongly and\r\nreiteratedly pressed upon him by his masters, the Court of Directors.\r\nThe first step taken after his appointment was to abolish the office of\r\nnaib dewan, and to send a committee through the provinces, at the\r\nexpense of 50,000_l._ a year, to make a settlement of rents to be paid\r\nby the natives for five years. At the same time he appointed one of the\r\nCompany's servants to be the collector in each province, and he\r\nabolished the General Board of Revenue, which had been established at\r\nMoorshedabad, chiefly for the following reasons: that, by its exercising\r\na separate control, the members of the Supreme Council at Calcutta were\r\nprevented from acquiring that intimate acquaintance with the revenues\r\nwhich was necessary to persons in their station; and because many of the\r\npowers necessary for the collection of the revenues could not be\r\ndelegated to a subordinate council. In consideration of these opinions,\r\norders, and declarations, he, in 1773, abolished the office of\r\ncollector, and transferred the management of the revenues to several\r\ncouncils of revenue, called Provincial Councils, and recommended their\r\nperpetual establishment by act of Parliament. In the year 1774, in\r\ncontradiction of his former opinion respecting the necessity of the\r\nSupreme Council possessing all possible means of becoming acquainted\r\nwith the details of the revenue, he again recommended the continuance of\r\nthe Provincial Councils in all their parts. This he again declared to be\r\nhis deliberate opinion in 1775 and in 1776.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time a majority of the Supreme Council, consisting of\r\nmembers who had generally differed in opinion from Mr. Hastings, had\r\ntransmitted their advice to the Court of Directors, recommending some\r\nchanges in the system of Provincial Councils. The Directors, in their\r\nreply to this recommendation, did in 1777 order the Supreme Council to\r\nform a new plan for the collection of the revenues, and to transmit it\r\nto them for their consideration.\r\n\r\nNo such plan was transmitted; but in the year 1781, Mr. Hastings having\r\nobtained a majority in the Council, he again changed the whole system,\r\nboth of collection of the revenue and of the executive administration of\r\ncivil and criminal justice. And who were the persons substituted in the\r\nplace of those whom he removed? Names, my Lords, with which you are\r\nalready but too well acquainted. At their head stands Munny Begum; then\r\ncomes his own domestic, and private bribe-agent, Gunga Govind Sing; then\r\nhis banian, Cantoo Baboo; then that instrument of all evil, Debi Sing;\r\nthen the whole tribe of his dependants, white and black, whom he made\r\nfarmers of the revenue, with Colonel Hannay at their head; and, lastly,\r\nhis confidential Residents, secret agents, and private secretaries, Mr.\r\nMiddleton, Major Palmer, &c., &c. Can your Lordships doubt, for a single\r\ninstant, of the real spirit of these proceedings? Can you doubt of the\r\nwhole design having originated and ended in corruption and peculation?\r\n\r\nWe have fully stated to you, from the authority of these parties\r\nthemselves, the effects and consequences of these proceedings,--namely,\r\nthe dilapidation of the revenues, and the ruin and desolation of the\r\nprovinces. And, my Lords, what else could have been expected or designed\r\nby this sweeping subversion of the control of the Company's servants\r\nover the collections of the revenue, and the vesting of it in a black\r\ndewan, but fraud and peculation? What else, I say, was to be expected,\r\nin the inextricable turnings and windings of that black mystery of\r\niniquity, but the concealment of every species of wrong, violence,\r\noutrage, and oppression?\r\n\r\nYour Lordships, then, have seen that the whole country was put into the\r\nhands of Gunga Govind Sing; and when you remember who this Gunga Govind\r\nSing was, and how effectually Mr. Hastings had secured him against\r\ndetection, in every part of his malpractices and atrocities, can you for\r\na moment hesitate to believe that the whole project was planned and\r\nexecuted for the purpose of putting all Bengal under contribution to Mr.\r\nHastings? But if you are resolved, after all this, to entertain a good\r\nopinion of Mr. Hastings,--if you have taken it into your heads, for\r\nreasons best known to yourselves, to imagine that he has some hidden\r\nvirtues, which in the government of Bengal he has not displayed, and\r\nwhich, to us of the House of Commons, have not been discernible in any\r\none single instance,--these virtues may be fit subjects for paragraphs\r\nin newspapers, they may be pleaded for him by the partisans of his\r\nIndian _faction_, but your Lordships will do well to remember that it is\r\nnot to Mr. Hastings himself that you are trusting, but to Gunga Govind\r\nSing. If the Committee were tools in his hands, must not Mr. Hastings\r\nhave also been a tool in his hands? If they with whom he daily and\r\nhourly had to transact business, and whose office it was to control and\r\nrestrain him, were unable so to do, is this control and restraint to be\r\nexpected from Mr. Hastings, who was his confidant, and whose corrupt\r\ntransactions he could at any time discover to the world? My worthy\r\ncolleague has traced the whole of Mr. Hastings's bribe account, in the\r\nmost clear and satisfactory manner, to Gunga Govind Sing,--him first,\r\nhim last, him midst, and without end. If we fail of the conviction of\r\nthe prisoner at your bar, your Lordships will not have acquitted Mr.\r\nHastings merely, but you will confirm all the robberies and rapines of\r\nGunga Govind Sing. You will recognize him as a faithful governor of\r\nIndia. Yes, my Lords, let us rejoice in this man! Let us adopt him as\r\nour own! Let our country, let this House, be proud of him! If Mr.\r\nHastings can be acquitted, we must admit Gunga Govind Sing's government\r\nto be the greatest blessing that ever happened to mankind. But if Gunga\r\nGovind Sing's government be the greatest curse that ever befell\r\nsuffering humanity, as we assert it to have been, there is the man that\r\nplaced him in it; there is his father, his godfather, the first author\r\nand origin of all these evils and, calamities. My Lords, remember\r\nDinagepore; remember the bribe of 40,000_l._ which Gunga Govind Sing\r\nprocured for Mr. Hastings in that province, and the subsequent horror of\r\nthat scene.\r\n\r\nBut, my Lords, do you extend your confidence to Gunga Govind Sing? Not\r\neven the face of this man, to whom the revenues of the Company, together\r\nwith the estates, fortunes, reputations, and lives of the inhabitants of\r\nthat country were delivered over, is known in those provinces. He\r\nresides at Calcutta, and is represented by a variety of under-agents. Do\r\nyou know Govind Ghose? Do you know Nundulol? Do you know the whole tribe\r\nof peculators, whom Mr. Hastings calls his faithful domestic servants?\r\nDo you know all the persons that Gunga Govind Sing must employ in the\r\nvarious ramifications of the revenues throughout all the provinces? Are\r\nyou prepared to trust all these? The Board of Revenue has confessed that\r\nit could not control them. Mr. Hastings himself could not control them.\r\nThe establishment of this system was like Sin's opening the gates of\r\nHell: like her, he could open the gate,--but to shut, as Milton says,\r\nexceeded his power. The former establishments, if defective, or if\r\nabuses were found in them, might have been corrected. There was at least\r\nthe means of detecting and punishing abuse. But Mr. Hastings destroyed\r\nthe means of doing either, by putting the whole country into the hands\r\nof Gunga Govind Sing.\r\n\r\nNow, having seen all these things done, look to the account. Your\r\nLordships will now be pleased to look at this business as a mere account\r\nof revenue. You will find, on comparing the three years in which Mr.\r\nHastings was in the minority with the three years after the appointment\r\nof this Committee, that the assessment upon the country increased, but\r\nthat the revenue was diminished; and you will also find, which is a\r\nmatter that ought to astonish you, that the expenses of the collections\r\nwere increased by no less a sum than 500,000_l._ You may judge from this\r\nwhat riot there was in rapacity and ravage, both amongst the European\r\nand native agents, but chiefly amongst the natives: for Mr. Hastings did\r\nnot divide the greatest part of this spoil among the Company's servants,\r\nbut among this gang of black dependants. These accounts are in pages\r\n1273 and 1274 of your Minutes.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, weighty indeed would have been the charge brought before your\r\nLordships by the Commons of Great Britain against the prisoner at your\r\nbar, if they had fixed upon no other crime or misdemeanor than that\r\nwhich I am now pressing upon you,--his throwing off the allegiance of\r\nthe Company, his putting a black master over himself, and his subjecting\r\nthe whole of Bengal, Bahar, and Orissa, the whole of the Company's\r\nservants, the Company's revenues, the Company's farms, to Gunga Govind\r\nSing. But, my Lords, it is a very curious and remarkable thing, that we\r\nhave traced this man as Mr. Hastings's bribe-broker up to the time of\r\nthe nomination of this Committee; we have traced him through a regular\r\nseries of bribery; he is Mr. Hastings's bribe-broker at Patna; he is Mr.\r\nHastings's bribe-broker at Nuddea; he is his bribe-broker at Dinagepore;\r\nwe find him his bribe-broker in all these places; but from the moment\r\nthat this Committee was constituted, it became a gulf in which the\r\nprevention, the detection, and the correction of all kind of abuses\r\nwere sunk and lost forever. From the time when this Committee and Gunga\r\nGovind Sing were appointed, you do not find one word more of Mr.\r\nHastings's bribes. Had he then ceased to receive any? or where are you\r\nto look for them? You are to look for them in that 500,000_l._ excess of\r\nexpense in the revenue department, and in the rest of all that corrupt\r\ntraffic of Gunga Govind Sing of which we gave you specimens at the time\r\nwe proved his known bribes to you. These are nothing but index-hands to\r\npoint out to you the immense mass of corruption which had its origin,\r\nand was daily accumulating in these provinces, under the protection of\r\nMr. Hastings. And can you think, and can we talk of such transactions,\r\nwithout feeling emotions of indignation and horror not to be described?\r\nCan we contemplate such scenes as these,--can we look upon those\r\ndesolated provinces, upon a country so ravaged, a people so\r\nsubdued,--Mahometans, Gentoos, our own countrymen, all trampled under\r\nfoot by this tyrant,--can we do this; without giving expression to those\r\nfeelings which, after animating us in this life, will comfort us when we\r\ndie, and will form our best part in another?\r\n\r\nMy Lords, I am now at the last day of my endeavors to inspire your\r\nLordships with a just sense of these unexampled atrocities. I have had a\r\ngreat encyclopedia of crimes to deal with; I will get through them as\r\nsoon as I can; and I pray your Lordships to believe, that, if I omit\r\nanything, it is to time I sacrifice it,--that it is to want of strength\r\nI sacrifice it,--that it is to necessity, and not from any despair of\r\nmaking, from the records and from the evidence, matter so omitted as\r\nblack as anything that I have yet brought before you.\r\n\r\nThe next thing of which I have to remind your Lordships respecting these\r\nblack agents of the prisoner is, that we find him, just before his\r\ndeparture from India, recommending three of them, Gunga Govind Sing,\r\nGunga Ghose, and Nundulol, as persons fit and necessary to be rewarded\r\nfor their services by the Company. Now your Lordships will find, that,\r\nof these faithful domestic servants, there is not one of them who was\r\nnot concerned in these enormous briberies, and in betraying their own\r\nnative and natural master. If I had time for it, I believe I could trace\r\nevery person to be, in proportion to Mr. Hastings's confidence in him,\r\nthe author of some great villany. These persons he thinks had not been\r\nsufficiently rewarded, and accordingly he recommends to the board, as\r\nhis dying legacy, provision for these faithful attached servants of his,\r\nand particularly for Gunga Govind Sing. The manner in which this man was\r\nto be rewarded makes a part of the history of these transactions, as\r\ncurious, perhaps, as was ever exhibited to the world. Your Lordships\r\nwill find it in page 2841 of your Minutes.\r\n\r\nThe Rajah of Dinagepore was a child at that time about eleven years old,\r\nand had succeeded to the Rajahship (by what means I shall say nothing)\r\nwhen he was about five years old. He is made to apply to Mr. Hastings\r\nfor leave to grant a very considerable part of his estate to Gunga\r\nGovind Sing, as a reward for his services. These services could only be\r\nknown to the Rajah's family by having robbed it of at least 40,000_l._,\r\nthe bribe given to Mr. Hastings. But the Rajah's family is so little\r\nsatisfied with this bountiful and liberal donation to Gunga Govind\r\nSing, that they desire that several purgunnahs, or farms, that are\r\nmentioned in the application made to the Council, should be separated\r\nfrom the family estate and given to this man. Such was this\r\nextraordinary gratitude: gratitude, not for money received, but for\r\nmoney taken away,--a species of gratitude unknown in any part of the\r\nworld but in India; gratitude pervading every branch of the family; his\r\nmother coming forward and petitioning likewise that her son should be\r\ndisinherited; his uncle, the natural protector and guardian of his\r\nminority, coming forward and petitioning most earnestly that his nephew\r\nshould be disinherited: all the family join in one voice of supplication\r\nto Mr. Hastings, that Gunga Govind Sing may have a very large and\r\nconsiderable part of their family estate given to him. Mr. Hastings,\r\nafter declaring that certain circumstances respecting this property,\r\nwhich are mentioned in his minutes, were to his knowledge true, but\r\nwhich your Lordships, upon examination, will find to be false, and\r\nfalsified in every particular, recommends, in the strongest manner, to\r\nthe board, a compliance with this application. He was at this time on\r\nthe eve of his departure from India, in haste to provide for his\r\nfaithful servants; and he well knew that this his last act would be held\r\nbinding upon his successors, who were devoted to him.\r\n\r\nHere, indeed, is genuine and heroic gratitude,--gratitude for money\r\nreceived, not for money taken away; and yet this gratitude was towards a\r\nperson who had paid himself out of the benefit which had been conferred,\r\nat the expense of a third party. For Gunga Govind Sing had kept for\r\nhimself 20,000_l._ out of 40,000_l._ taken from the Rajah. For this\r\ncheat, stated by Mr. Larkins to be such, and allowed by Mr. Hastings\r\nhimself to be such, he, with a perfect knowledge of that fraud and cheat\r\ncommitted upon the public, (for he pretends that the money was meant for\r\nthe Company,) makes this supplication to his colleagues, and departs.\r\n\r\nAfter his departure, Gunga Govind Sing, relying upon the continuance of\r\nthe corrupt influence which he had gained, had the impudence to come\r\nforward and demand the confirmation of this grant by the\r\nCouncil-General. The Council, though willing to accede to Mr. Hastings's\r\nproposition, were stopped in a moment by petitions much more natural,\r\nbut of a direct contrary tenor. The poor infant Rajah raises his cries\r\nnot to be deprived of his inheritance; his mother comes forward and\r\nconjures the Council not to oppress her son and wrong her family; the\r\nuncle comes and supplicates the board to save from ruin these devoted\r\nvictims which were under his protection. All these counter-petitions\r\ncome before the Council while the ink is hardly dry upon the petitions\r\nwhich Mr. Hastings had left behind him, as proofs of the desire of this\r\nfamily to be disinherited in favor of Gunga Govind Sing. Upon the\r\nreceipt of these remonstrances, the board could not proceed in the\r\nbusiness, and accordingly Gunga Govind Sing was defeated.\r\n\r\nBut Gunga Govind Sing was unwilling to quit his prey. And what does he\r\ndo? I desire your Lordships to consider seriously the reply of Gunga\r\nGovind Sing, as it appears upon your minutes. It is a bold answer. He\r\ndenies the right of the Rajah to these estates. \"Why,\" says he, \"all\r\nproperty in this country depends upon the will of your government. How\r\ncame this Rajah's family into possession of this great zemindary? Why,\r\nthey got it at first by the mere favor of government. The whole was an\r\niniquitous transaction. This is a family that in some former age has\r\nrobbed others; and now let me rob them.\" In support of this claim, he\r\nadds the existence of other precedents, namely, \"that many clerks or\r\nmutsuddies and banians at Calcutta had,\" as he says, \"got possession of\r\nthe lands of other people without any pretence of right;--why should not\r\nI?\" Good God! what precedents are these!\r\n\r\nYour Lordships shall now hear the razinama, or testimonial, which, since\r\nMr. Hastings's arrival in England, this Rajah has been induced to send\r\nto the Company from India, and you will judge then of the state in which\r\nMr. Hastings has left that country. Hearken, my Lords, I pray you, to\r\nthe razinama of this man, from whom 40,000_l._ was taken by Mr. Hastings\r\nand Gunga Govind Sing, and against whom an attempt was made by the same\r\npersons to deprive him of his inheritance. Listen to this razinama, and\r\nthen judge of all the other testimonials which have been produced on the\r\npart of the prisoner at your bar. His counsel rest upon them, they glory\r\nin them, and we shall not abate them one of these precious testimonials.\r\nThey put the voice of grateful India against the voice of ungrateful\r\nEngland. Now hear what grateful India says, after our having told you\r\nfor what it was so grateful.\r\n\r\n     \"I, Radanaut, Zemindar of Purgunnah Havelly Punjera, commonly\r\n     called Dinagepore:--As it has been learnt by me, the mutsuddies and\r\n     respectable officers of my zemindary, that the ministers of\r\n     England are displeased with the late Governor, Warren Hastings,\r\n     Esquire, upon the suspicion that he oppressed us, took money from\r\n     us by deceit and force, and ruined the country, therefore we, upon\r\n     the strength of our religion, which we think it incumbent on and\r\n     necessary for us to abide by, following the rules laid down in\r\n     giving evidence, declare the particulars of the acts and deeds of\r\n     Warren Hastings, Esquire, full of circumspection and caution,\r\n     civility and justice, superior to the conduct of the most learned,\r\n     and by representing what is fact wipe away the doubts that have\r\n     possessed the minds of the ministers of England; that Mr. Hastings\r\n     is possessed of fidelity and confidence, and yielding protection to\r\n     us; that he is clear from the contamination of mistrust and wrong,\r\n     and his mind is free of covetousness and avarice. During the time\r\n     of his administration, no one saw other conduct than that of\r\n     protection to the husbandmen, and justice; no inhabitant ever\r\n     experienced affliction, no one ever felt oppression from him. Our\r\n     reputations have always been guarded from attacks by his prudence,\r\n     and our families have always been protected by his justice.\"\r\n\r\nGood God! my Lords, \"_our families protected by his justice_\"! What!\r\nafter Gunga Govind Sing, in concert with Mr. Hastings, had first robbed\r\nhim of 40,000_l._, and then had attempted to snatch, as it were, out of\r\nthe mouths of babes and sucklings the inheritance of their fathers, and\r\nto deprive this infant of a great part of his family estate? Here is a\r\nchild, eleven years old, who never could have seen Mr. Hastings, who\r\ncould know nothing of him but from the heavy hand of oppression,\r\naffliction, wrong, and robbery, brought to bear testimony to the virtues\r\nof Mr. Hastings before a British Parliament! Such is the confidence they\r\nrepose in their hope of having bribed the English nation by the millions\r\nand millions of money, the countless lacs of rupees, poured into it from\r\nIndia, that they had dared to bring this poor robbed infant to bear\r\ntestimony to the character of Mr. Hastings! These are the things which\r\nare to be opposed to the mass of evidence which the House of Commons\r\nbring against this man,--evidence which they bring from his own acts,\r\nhis own writing, and his own records,--a cloud of testimony furnished by\r\nhimself in support of charges brought forward and urged by us agreeably\r\nto the magnitude of his crimes, with the horror which is inspired by\r\nthem, and with the contempt due to this paltry attempt towards his\r\ndefence, which they had dared to produce from the hands of an infant but\r\neleven years old when Mr. Hastings quitted that country!\r\n\r\nBut to proceed with the razinama.\r\n\r\n     \"He never omitted the smallest instance of kindness towards us, but\r\n     healed the wounds of despair with the salve of consolation, by\r\n     means of his benevolent and kind behavior, never permitting one of\r\n     us to sink in the pit of despondence. He supported every one by his\r\n     goodness, overset the designs of evil-minded men by his authority,\r\n     tied the hand of oppression with the strong bandage of justice, and\r\n     by these means expanded the pleasing appearance of happiness and\r\n     joy over us. He reëstablished justice and impartiality. We were\r\n     during his government in the enjoyment of perfect happiness and\r\n     ease, and many of us are thankful and satisfied. As Mr. Hastings\r\n     was well acquainted with our manners and customs, he was always\r\n     desirous in every respect of doing whatever would preserve our\r\n     religious rites, and guard them against every kind of accident and\r\n     injury, and at all times protected us. Whatever we have experienced\r\n     from him, and whatever happened from him, we have written without\r\n     deceit or exaggeration.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, before I take leave of this affair of bribes and of the great\r\nbribe-broker, let me just offer a remark to your Lordships upon one\r\ncurious transaction. My Lords, we have charged a bribe taken from the\r\nNabob of Oude, and we have stated the corrupt and scandalous proceeding\r\nwhich attended it. I thought I had done with Oude; but as there is a\r\ngolden chain between all the virtues, so there is a golden chain which\r\nlinks together all the vices. Mr. Hastings, as you have seen, and as my\r\nhonorable colleague has fully opened it to you, received a bribe or\r\ncorrupt present from the Nabob of Oude in September, 1781. We heard no\r\nmore of this bribe than what we had stated, (no other trace of it ever\r\nappearing in the Company's records, except in a private letter written\r\nby Mr. Hastings to the Court of Directors, and afterwards in a\r\ncommunication such as you have heard through Mr. Larkins,) till October,\r\n1783.\r\n\r\nBut, my Lords, we have since discovered, through and in consequence of\r\nthe violent disputes which took place between Mr. Hastings and the clan\r\nof Residents that were in Oude,--the Resident of the Company, Mr.\r\nBristow, the two Residents of Mr. Hastings, Mr. Middleton and Mr.\r\nJohnson, and the two Residents sent by him to watch over all the rest,\r\nMajor Palmer and Major Davy,--upon quarrels, I say, between them, we\r\ndiscovered that Mr. Middleton had received the offer of a present of\r\n100,000_l._ in February, 1782. This circumstance is mentioned in a\r\nletter of Mr. Middleton's, in which he informs Mr. Hastings that the\r\nNabob had destined such a sum for him.\r\n\r\nNow the first thing that will occur to your Lordships upon such an\r\naffair will be a desire to know what it was that induced the Nabob to\r\nmake this offer. It was but in the September preceding that Mr. Hastings\r\nhad received, for his private use, as the Nabob conceived, so bountiful\r\na present as 100,000_l._; what motive, then, could he have had in\r\nFebruary to offer him another 100,000_l._? This man, at the time, was\r\npiercing heaven itself with the cries of despondency, despair, beggary,\r\nand ruin. You have seen that he was forced to rob his own family, in\r\norder to satisfy the Company's demands upon him; and yet this is\r\nprecisely the time when he thinks proper to offer 100,000_l._ to Mr.\r\nHastings. Does not the mind of every man revolt, whilst he exclaims, and\r\nsay, \"What! another 100,000_l._ to Mr. Hastings?\" What reason had the\r\nNabob to think Mr. Hastings so monstrously insatiable, that, having but\r\nthe September before received 100,000_l._, he must give him another in\r\nFebruary? My Lords, he must, in the interval, have threatened the Nabob\r\nwith some horrible catastrophe, from which he was to redeem himself by\r\nthis second present. You can assign no other motive for his giving it.\r\nWe know not what answer Mr. Hastings made to Mr. Middleton upon that\r\noccasion, but we find that in the year 1783 Mr. Hastings asserts that he\r\nsent up Major Palmer and Major Davy to persuade the Nabob to transfer\r\nthis present, which the Nabob intended for him, to the Company's\r\nservice. Remark, my Lords, the progress of this affair. In a formal\r\naccusation preferred against Mr. Middleton, he charges him with\r\nobstructing this design of his. In this accusation, my Lords, you find\r\nhim at once in the curious character of prosecutor, witness, and judge.\r\n\r\nLet us see how he comports himself. I shall only state to you one of the\r\narticles of his impeachment; it is the third charge; it is in page 1267\r\nof your Lordships' Minutes.\r\n\r\n     \"For sending repeatedly to the Vizier, and to his minister, Hyder\r\n     Beg Khân, to advise them against transferring the ten lacs of\r\n     rupees intended as a present to the Governor-General to the\r\n     Company's account; as it would be a precedent for further demands,\r\n     which if the Vizier did not refuse in the first instance, the\r\n     government would never cease to harass him for money.\"\r\n\r\nThe first thing that will occur to your Lordships is an assertion of the\r\naccuser's:--\"I am morally certain, that jaidads or assets for ten lacs,\r\neither in assignment of land or in bills, had been prepared, and were in\r\nthe charge or possession of Mr. Middleton, before Major Palmer's\r\narrival, and left with Mr. Johnson on Mr. Middleton's departure.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, here is an accusation that Mr. Middleton had actually received\r\nmoney, either in bills or assets of some kind or other,--and that, upon\r\nquitting his Residency, he had handed it over to his successor, Mr.\r\nJohnson. Here are, then, facts asserted, and we must suppose\r\nsubstantiated. Here is a sum of money to be accounted for, in which\r\nthere is a gross malversation directly charged as to these particulars,\r\nin Mr. Hastings's opinion. Mr. Macpherson, another member of the\r\nCouncil, has declared, that he understood at the time that the ten lacs\r\nwere actually deposited in bills, and that it was not a mere offer made\r\nby the Nabob to pay such a sum from the future revenue of the country.\r\nMr. Hastings has these facts disclosed to him. He declares that he was\r\n\"_morally_ certain\" of it,--that is, as certain as a man can be of\r\nanything; because physical certitude does not belong to such matters.\r\nThe first thing you will naturally ask is, \"Why does he not ask Mr.\r\nJohnson how he had disposed of that money which Mr. Middleton had put in\r\nhis hands?\" He does no such thing; he passes over it totally, as if it\r\nwere no part of the matter in question, and the accusation against Mr.\r\nMiddleton terminates in the manner you will there find stated. When Mr.\r\nJohnson is asked, \"Why was not that money applied to the Company's\r\nservice?\" he boldly steps forward, and says, \"I prevented it from being\r\nso applied. It never was, it never ought to have been, so applied; such\r\nan appropriation of money to be taken from the Nabob would have been\r\nenormous upon that occasion.\"\r\n\r\nWhat, then, does Mr. Hastings do? Does he examine Mr. Middleton upon the\r\nsubject, who charges himself with having received the money? Mr.\r\nMiddleton was at that very time in Calcutta, called down thither by Mr.\r\nHastings himself. One would naturally expect that he would call upon him\r\nto explain for what purpose he left the money with Mr. Johnson. He did\r\nno such thing. Did he examine Mr. Johnson himself, who was charged with\r\nhaving received the money from Mr. Middleton? Did he ask him what he had\r\ndone with that money? Not one word. Did he send for Major Palmer and\r\nMajor Davy to account for it? No. Did he call any shroff, any banker,\r\nany one person concerned in the payment of the money, or any one person\r\nin the management of the revenue? No, not one. Directly in the face of\r\nhis own assertions, directly contrary to his moral conviction of the\r\nfact that the money had been actually deposited, he tries Mr. Johnson\r\ncollusively and obliquely, not upon the account of what was done with\r\nthe money, but why it was prevented from being applied to the Company's\r\nservice; and he acquits him in a manner that (taking the whole of it\r\ntogether) will give your Lordships the finest idea possible of a Bengal\r\njudicature, as exercised by Mr. Hastings.\r\n\r\n\"I am not sorry,\" says he, \"that Mr. Johnson chose to defeat my\r\nintentions; since it would have added to the Nabob's distresses, but\r\nwith no immediate relief to the Company. If, in his own breast, he can\r\nview the secret motives of this transaction, and on their testimony\r\napprove it, I also acquit him.\"\r\n\r\nMerciful God! Here is a man accused by regular articles of impeachment.\r\nThe accuser declares he is morally certain that the money had been\r\nreceived, but was prevented from being applied to its destination by the\r\nperson accused; and he acquits him. Does he acquit him from his own\r\nknowledge, or from any evidence? No: but he applies to the man's\r\nconscience, and says, \"If you in your conscience can acquit yourself, I\r\nacquit you.\"\r\n\r\nHere, then, is a proceeding the most astonishing and shameless that\r\nperhaps was ever witnessed: a court trying a man for a delinquency and\r\nmisapplication of money, destined, in the first instance, for the use of\r\nthe judge, but which he declares ought, in his own opinion, to be set\r\napart for the public use, and which he was desirous of applying to the\r\nCompany's service, without regard to his own interest, and then the\r\njudge declaring he is not sorry that his purpose had been defeated by\r\nthe party accused. Instead, however, of censuring the accused, he\r\napplies to the man's own conscience. \"Does your conscience,\" says he,\r\n\"acquit you of having acted wrong?\" The accused makes no reply; and then\r\nMr. Hastings, by an hypothetical conclusion, acquits him.\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings is accused by the Commons for that, having a moral\r\ncertainty of the money's being intended for his use, he would not have\r\nceased to inquire into the actual application of it but from some\r\ncorrupt motive and intention. With this he is charged. He comes before\r\nyou to make his defence. Mr. Middleton is in England. Does he call Mr.\r\nMiddleton to explain it here? Does he call upon Mr. Johnson, who was the\r\nother day in this court, to account for it? Why did he not, when he sent\r\nfor these curious papers and testimonials to Major Palmer, (the person\r\nauthorized, as he pretends, by him, to resign all his pretensions to the\r\nmoney procured,) send for Major Palmer, who is the person that accused\r\nhim in this business,--why not send for him to bear some testimony\r\nrespecting it? No: he had time enough, but at no one time and in no\r\nplace did he do this; therefore the imputation of the foulest corruption\r\nattaches upon him, joined with the infamy of a collusive prosecution,\r\ninstituted for the sake of a collusive acquittal.\r\n\r\nHaving explained to your Lordships the nature, and detailed the\r\ncircumstances, as far as we are acquainted with them, of this fraudulent\r\ntransaction, we have only further to remind you, that, though Mr.\r\nMiddleton was declared guilty of five of the six charges brought against\r\nhim by Mr. Hastings, yet the next thing you hear is, that Mr. Hastings,\r\nafter declaring that this conduct of Mr. Middleton had been very bad,\r\nand that the conduct of the other servants of the Company concerned with\r\nhim had been ten times worse, he directly appoints him to one of the\r\nmost honorable and confidential offices the Company had to dispose of:\r\nhe sends him ambassador to the Nizam,--to give to all the courts of\r\nIndia a specimen of the justice, honor, and decency of the British\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, with regard to the bribe for the _entertainment_, I only beg\r\nleave to make one observation to you upon that article. I could say, if\r\nthe time would admit it, a great deal upon that subject; but I wish to\r\ncompress it, and I shall therefore only recommend it in general to your\r\nLordships' deliberate consideration. The covenant subsisting between the\r\nCompany and its servants was made for the express purpose of putting an\r\nend to all such entertainments. By this convention it is ordered that no\r\npresents exceeding 200_l._ [400_l._?] shall be accepted upon any\r\npretence for an entertainment. The covenant was intended to put an end\r\nto the custom of receiving money for entertainments, even when visiting\r\nan independent Oriental prince. But your Lordships know that the Nabob\r\nwas no prince, but a poor, miserable, undone dependant upon, the\r\nCompany. The present was also taken by Mr. Hastings at a time when he\r\nwent upon the cruel commission of cutting down the Nabob's allowance\r\nfrom 400,000_l._ to 260,000_l._ [160,000_l._?], and when he was reducing\r\nto beggary thousands of persons who were dependent for bread upon the\r\nNabob, and ruining, perhaps, forty thousand others. I shall say no more\r\nupon that subject, though, in truth, it is a thing upon which much\r\nobservation might be made.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI shall now pass on to another article connected with, though not making\r\na direct part of, that of corrupt bribery: I mean the swindling\r\nsubterfuges by which he has attempted to justify his corrupt practices.\r\nAt one time, he defends them by pleading the necessities of his own\r\naffairs,--as when he takes presents and entertainments avowedly for his\r\nown profits. At another time he defends them by pleading the goodness of\r\nhis intentions: he intended, he says, to give the money to the Company.\r\nHis last plea has something in it (which shall I say?) of a more awful\r\nor of a more abandoned character, or of both. In the settlement of his\r\npublic account, before he left India, he takes credit for a bond which\r\nhe had received from Nobkissin upon some account or other. He then,\r\nreturns to England, and what does he do? Pay off? No. Give up the bond\r\nto the Company? No. He says, \"I will account to the Company for this\r\nmoney.\" And when he comes to give this account of the expenditure of\r\nthis money, your Lordships will not be a little astonished at the items\r\nof it. One is for founding a Mahometan college. It is a very strange\r\nthing that Rajah Nobkissin, who is a Gentoo, should be employed by Mr.\r\nHastings to found a Mahometan college. We will allow Mr. Hastings, who\r\nis a Christian, or would be thought a Christian, to grow pious at last,\r\nand, as many others have done, who have spent their lives in fraud,\r\nrapacity, and peculation, to seek amends and to expiate his crimes by\r\ncharitable foundations. Nay, we will suppose Mr. Hastings to have taken\r\nit into his head to turn Mahometan, (Gentoo he could not,) and to have\r\ndesigned by a Mahometan foundation to expiate his offences. Be it so;\r\nbut why should Nobkissin pay for it? We will pass over this also. But\r\nwhen your Lordships shall hear of what nature that foundation was, I\r\nbelieve you will allow that a more extraordinary history never did\r\nappear in the world.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, he stated to the Council, on the 18th of April,\r\n1781, that in the month of November, 1780, a petition was presented to\r\nhim by a considerable number of Mussulmen, in compliance with which this\r\nMahometan college appears to have been founded. It next appears from his\r\nstatement, that in the April following, (that is, within about six\r\nmonths after the foundation,) many students had finished their\r\neducation. You see what a hot-bed bribery and corruption is. Our\r\nuniversities cannot furnish an education in six years: in India they\r\nhave completed it within six months, and have taken their degrees.\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings says, \"I have supported this establishment to this time at\r\nmy own expense; I desire the Company will now defray the charge of it.\"\r\nHe then calculates what the expenses were; he calculates that the\r\nbuilding would cost about 6,000_l._, and he gets from the Company a bond\r\nto raise money for paying this 6,000_l._ You apparently have the\r\nbuilding now at the public expense, and Mr. Hastings still stands\r\ncharged with the expense of the college for six months. He then proposes\r\nthat a tract of land should be given for the college, to the value of\r\nabout three thousand odd pounds a year,--and that in the mean time there\r\nshould be a certain sum allotted for its expenses. After this Mr.\r\nHastings writes a letter from the Ganges to the Company, in which he\r\nsays not a word about the expense of the building, but says that the\r\ncollege was founded and maintained at his own expense, though it was\r\nthought to be maintained by the Company; and he fixes the commencement\r\nof the expense in September, 1779. But, after all, we find that the very\r\nprofessor who was to be settled there never so much as arrived in\r\nCalcutta, or showed his face there, till some time afterwards. And look\r\nat Mr. Larkins's private accounts, and you will find that he charges the\r\nexpense to have commenced not until October, 1781. It is no error,\r\nbecause it runs through and is so accounted in the whole: and it thus\r\nappears that he has charged, falsely and fraudulently, a year more for\r\nthat establishment than it cost him.\r\n\r\nAt last, then, when he was coming away, (for I hasten to the conclusion\r\nof an affair ludicrous indeed in some respects, but not unworthy of your\r\nLordships' consideration,) \"after remarking that he had experienced for\r\nthree years the utility of this institution, he recommends that they\r\nwill establish a fund for 3,000_l._ a year for it, and give it to the\r\nmaster.\" He had left Gunga Govind Sing as a Gentoo legacy, and he now\r\nleaves the Mussulman as a Mahometan legacy to the Company.\r\n\r\nYour Lordships shall now hear what was the upshot of the whole. The\r\nCompany soon afterwards hearing that this college was become the\r\ngreatest nuisance in Calcutta, and that it had raised the cries of all\r\nthe inhabitants against it, one of their servants, a Mr. Chapman, was\r\ndeputed by the Governor, Sir John Shore, to examine into it, and your\r\nLordships will find the account he gives of it in your minutes. In\r\nshort, my Lords, we find that this was a seminary of robbers,\r\nhousebreakers, and every nuisance to society; so that the Company was\r\nobliged to turn out the master, and to remodel the whole. Your Lordships\r\nwill now judge of the merits and value of this, one of the sets-off\r\nbrought forward by the prisoner against the charges which we have\r\nbrought forward against him: it began in injustice and peculation, and\r\nended in a seminary for robbers and housebreakers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNothing now remains to be pressed by me upon your Lordships'\r\nconsideration, but the account given by the late Governor-General, Earl\r\nCornwallis, of the state in which he found the country left by his\r\npredecessor, Mr. Hastings, the prisoner at your bar. But, patient as I\r\nknow your Lordships to be, I also know that your strength is not\r\ninexhaustible; and though what I have farther to add will not consume\r\nmuch of your Lordships' time, yet I conceive that there is a necessity\r\nfor deferring it to another day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH\r\n\r\nIN\r\n\r\nGENERAL REPLY.\r\n\r\nNINTH DAY: MONDAY, JUNE 16, 1794.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Lords,--I should think it necessary to make an apology to your\r\nLordships for appearing before you one day more, if I were inclined to\r\nmeasure this business either by the standard of my own ability, or by my\r\nown impatience, or by any supposed impatience of yours. I know no\r\nmeasure, in such a case, but the nature of the subject, and the duty\r\nwhich we owe to it. You will therefore, my Lords, permit me, in a few\r\nwords, to lead you back to what we did yesterday, that you may the\r\nbetter comprehend the manner in which I mean to conclude the business\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, we took the liberty of stating to you the condition of Bengal\r\nbefore our taking possession of it, and of the several classes of its\r\ninhabitants. We first brought before you the Mahometan inhabitants, who\r\nhad the judicial authority of the country in their hands; and we proved\r\nto you the utter ruin of that body of people, and with them of the\r\njustice of the country, by their being, both one and the other, sold to\r\nan infamous woman called Munny Begum. We next showed you, that the whole\r\nlanded interest, the zemindars, or Hindoo gentry of the country, was\r\nlikewise ruined by its being given over, by letting it on a five years'\r\nlease, to infamous farmers, and giving it up to their merciless\r\nexactions,--and afterwards by subjecting the rank of those zemindars,\r\ntheir title-deeds, and all their pecuniary affairs, to the minutest\r\nscrutiny, under pain of criminal punishment, by a commission granted to\r\na nefarious villain called Gunga Govind Sing. We lastly showed you that\r\nthe remaining third class, that of the English, was partly corrupted, or\r\nhad its authority dissolved, and that the whole superintending English\r\ncontrol was subverted or subdued,--that the products of the country were\r\ndiminished, and that the revenues of the Company were dilapidated, by an\r\novercharge of expenses, in four years, to the amount of 500,000_l._, in\r\nconsequence of these corrupt, dangerous, and mischievous projects.\r\n\r\nWe have farther stated, that the Company's servants were corrupted by\r\ncontracts and jobs; we proved that those that were not so corrupted were\r\nremoved from their stations or reduced to a state of abject dependence;\r\nwe showed you the destruction of the Provincial Councils, the\r\ndestruction of the Council-General, and the formation of a committee for\r\nno other ends whatever but for the purposes of bribery, concealment, and\r\ncorruption. We next stated some of the most monstrous instances of that\r\nbribery; and though we were of opinion that in none of them any\r\nsatisfactory defence worth mentioning had been made, yet we have thought\r\nthat this should not hinder us from recalling to your Lordships'\r\nrecollection the peculiar nature and circumstances of one of those\r\nproceedings.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings to which we wish to call your attention are those\r\nbelonging to the second bribe given by the Nabob of Oude to Mr.\r\nHastings. Mr. Hastings's own knowledge and opinion that that money was\r\nset apart for his use, either in bills or assets, I have before stated;\r\nand I now wish to call your Lordships' minute recollection to the manner\r\nin which the fraudulent impeachment of Mr. Middleton, for the purpose of\r\nstifling an inquiry into that business, was carried on. Your Lordships\r\nwill remember that I proved to you, upon the face of that proceeding,\r\nthe collusive nature of the accusation, and that the real state of the\r\ncase was not charged,--and that Mr. Hastings acquitted the party accused\r\nof one article of the charge, not upon the evidence of the case,\r\ncontrary to his own avowed, declared, moral certainty of his guilt, but\r\nupon a pretended appeal to the conscience of the man accused. He did\r\nnot, however, give him a complete, formal, official acquittal, but\r\nreferred the matter to the Court of Directors, who could not possibly\r\nknow anything of the matter, without one article of evidence whatever\r\nproduced at the time or transmitted. We lastly proved to you, that,\r\nafter finding him guilty of five charges, and leaving the other to the\r\nCourt of Directors, Mr. Hastings, without any reason assigned, appointed\r\nhim to a great office in the Company's service.\r\n\r\nThese proceedings were brought before you for two purposes: first, to\r\nshow the corrupt principle of the whole proceeding; next, to show the\r\nmanner in which the Company's servants are treated. They are accused and\r\npersecuted, until they are brought to submit to whatever terms it may be\r\nthought proper to impose upon them; they are then formally, indeed,\r\nacquitted of the most atrocious crimes charged against them, but\r\nvirtually condemned upon some articles, with the scourge hung over\r\nthem,--and in some instances rewarded by the greatest, most honorable,\r\nand most lucrative situations in the Company's service. My Lords, it is\r\non the same ground of the wicked, pernicious, and ruinous principles of\r\nMr. Hastings's government, that I have charged this with everything that\r\nis chargeable against him, namely, that, if your Lordships should ratify\r\nthose principles by your acquittal of him, they become principles of\r\ngovernment,--rejected, indeed, by the Commons, but adopted by the\r\nPeerage of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThere is another article which I have just touched, but which I must do\r\nmore than barely notice, upon account of the evil example of it: I mean\r\nthe taking great sums of money, under pretence of an entertainment. Your\r\nLordships will recollect, that, when this business was charged against\r\nhim in India, Mr. Hastings neither affirmed nor denied the fact.\r\nConfession could not be there extorted from him. He next appeared before\r\nthe House of Commons, and he still evaded a denial or a confession of\r\nit. He lastly appeared before your Lordships, and in his answer to our\r\ncharge he in the same manner evaded either a confession or a denial. He\r\nforced us to employ a great part of a session in endeavoring to\r\nestablish what we have at last established, the receipt of the sums\r\nfirst charged, and of seven lacs more, by him. At length the proof could\r\nnot be evaded; and after we had fought through all the difficulties\r\nwhich the law could interpose in his defence, and of which he availed\r\nhimself with a degree of effrontery that has, I believe, no example in\r\nthe world, he confesses, avows, and justifies his conduct. If the custom\r\nalleged be well founded, and be an honorable and a proper and just\r\npractice, why did he not avow it in every part and progress of our\r\nproceedings here? Why should he have put us to the necessity of wasting\r\nso many months in the proof of the fact? And why, after we have proved\r\nit, and not before, did he confess it, avow it, and even glory in it?\r\n\r\nI must remind your Lordships that the sum charged to be so taken by way\r\nof entertainment made only a part, a single article, of the bribes\r\ncharged by Nundcomar to have been received by Mr. Hastings; and when we\r\nfind him confessing, what he could not deny, that single article, and\r\nevading all explanation respecting the others, and not giving any reason\r\nwhatever why one was received and the others rejected, your Lordships\r\nwill judge of the strong presumption of his having taken them all, even\r\nif we had given no other proofs of it. We think, however, that we have\r\nproved the whole very satisfactorily. But whether we have or not, the\r\nproof of a single present received is sufficient; because the principle\r\nto be established respecting these bribes is this,--whether or not a\r\nGovernor-General, paying a visit to any of the poor, miserable,\r\ndependent creatures called sovereign princes in that country, (men whom\r\nMr. Hastings has himself declared to be nothing but phantoms, and that\r\nthey had no one attribute of sovereignty about them,) whether, I say, he\r\ncan consider them to be such sovereign princes as to justify his taking\r\nfrom them great sums of money by way of a present. The Nabob, in fact,\r\nwas not a sovereign prince, nor a country power, in any sense but that\r\nwhich the Company meant to exempt from the custom of making presents. It\r\nwas their design to prevent their servants from availing themselves of\r\nthe real dependence of the nominal native powers to extort money from\r\nthem under the pretence of their sovereignty. Such presents, so far from\r\nbeing voluntary, were in reality obtained from their weakness, their\r\nhopeless and unprotected condition; and you are to decide whether or not\r\nthis custom, which is insisted upon by the prisoner's counsel, with\r\ngreat triumph, to be a thing which he could not evade, without breaking\r\nthrough all the usages of the country, and violating principles\r\nestablished by the most clear law of India, is to be admitted as his\r\njustification.\r\n\r\nIt was on this very account, namely, the extortion suffered by these\r\npeople, under the name or pretence of presents, that the Company first\r\nbound their servants by a covenant, which your Lordships shall now hear\r\nread.\r\n\r\n     \"That they shall not take any grant of lands, or rents or revenues\r\n     issuing out of lands, or any territorial possession, jurisdiction,\r\n     dominion, power, or authority whatsoever, from any of the Indian\r\n     princes, sovereigns, subahs, or nabobs, or any of their ministers,\r\n     servants, or agents, for any service or services, or upon any\r\n     account or pretence whatsoever, without the license or consent of\r\n     the Court of Directors.\"\r\n\r\nThis clause in the covenant had doubtless a regard to Lord Clive, and to\r\nSir Hector Munro, and to some others, who had received gifts, and grants\r\nof jaghires, and other territorial revenues, that were confirmed by the\r\nCompany. But though this confirmation might be justifiable at a time\r\nwhen we had no real sovereignty in the country, yet the Company very\r\nwisely provided afterwards, that under no pretence whatever should their\r\nservants have the means of extorting from the sovereigns or pretended\r\nsovereigns of the country any of their lands or possessions. Afterwards\r\nit appeared that there existed abuses of a similar nature, and\r\nparticularly (as was proved before us in the year 1773, and reported to\r\nour House, upon the evidence of Mahomed Reza Khân) the practice of\r\nfrequently visiting the princes, and of extorting, under pretence of\r\nsuch visits, great sums of money. All their servants, and the\r\nGovernor-General particularly, were therefore obliged to enter into the\r\nfollowing covenant:--\r\n\r\n     \"That they shall not, directly or indirectly, accept, take, or\r\n     receive, or agree to accept, take, or receive, any gift, reward,\r\n     gratuity, allowance, donation, or compensation, in money, effects,\r\n     jewels, or otherwise howsoever, from any of the Indian princes,\r\n     sovereigns, subahs, or nabobs, or any of their ministers, servants,\r\n     or agents, exceeding the value of four thousand rupees, for any\r\n     service or services performed or to be performed by them in India,\r\n     or upon any other account or pretence whatsoever.\"\r\n\r\nBy this covenant, my Lords, Mr. Hastings is forbidden to accept, upon\r\nany pretence and under any name whatsoever, any sum above four thousand\r\nrupees,--that is to say, any sum above four hundred pounds. Now the sum\r\nthat was here received is eighteen thousand pounds sterling, by way of a\r\npresent, under the name of an allowance for an entertainment, which is\r\nthe precise thing which his covenant was made to prevent. The covenant\r\nsuffered him to receive four hundred pounds: if he received more than\r\nthat money, he became a criminal, he had broken his covenant, and\r\nforfeited the obligation he had made with his masters. Think with\r\nyourselves, my Lords, what you will do, if you acquit the prisoner of\r\nthis charge. You will avow the validity, you will sanction the principle\r\nof his defence: for, as the fact is avowed, there is an end of that.\r\n\r\nGood God! my Lords, where are we? If they conceal their gifts and\r\npresents, they are safe by their concealment; if they avow them, they\r\nare still safer. They plead the customs of the country, or rather, the\r\ncustoms which we have introduced into the country,--customs which have\r\nbeen declared to have their foundation in a system of the most\r\nabominable corruption, the most flagitious extortion, the most dreadful\r\noppression,--those very customs which their covenant is made to abolish.\r\nThink where your Lordships are. You have before you a covenant declaring\r\nthat he should take under no name whatever (I do not know how words\r\ncould be selected in the English language more expressive) any sum more\r\nthan four hundred pounds. He says, \"I have taken eighteen thousand\r\npounds.\" He makes his counsel declare, and he desires your Lordships to\r\nconfirm their declaration, that he is not only justifiable in so doing,\r\nbut that he ought to do so,--that he ought to break his covenant, and\r\nact in direct contradiction to it. He does not even pretend to say that\r\nthis money was intended, either inwardly or outwardly, avowedly or\r\ncovertly, for the Company's service. He put absolutely into his own\r\npocket eighteen thousand pounds, besides his salary.\r\n\r\nConsider, my Lords, the consequences of this species of iniquity. If any\r\nservant of the Company, high in station, chooses to make a visit from\r\nCalcutta to Moorshedabad, which Moorshedabad was then the residence of\r\nour principal revenue government,--if he should choose to take an\r\nairing for his health, if he has a fancy to make a little voyage for\r\npleasure as far as Moorshedabad, in one of those handsome barges or\r\nbudgeros of which you have heard so much in his charge against\r\nNundcomar, he can put twenty thousand pounds into his pocket any day he\r\npleases, in defiance of all our acts of Parliament, covenants, and\r\nregulations.\r\n\r\nDo you make your laws, do you make your covenants, for the very purpose\r\nof their being evaded? Is this the purpose for which a British tribunal\r\nsits here, to furnish a subject for an epigram, or a tale for the\r\nlaughter of the world? Believe me, my Lords, the world is not to be thus\r\ntrifled with. But, my Lords, you will never trifle with your duty. You\r\nhave a gross, horrid piece of corruption before you,--impudently\r\nconfessed, and more impudently defended. But you will not suffer Mr.\r\nHastings to say, \"I have only to go to Moorshedabad, or to order the\r\nNabob to meet me half way, and I can set aside and laugh at all your\r\ncovenants and acts of Parliament.\" Is this all the force and power of\r\nthe covenant by which you would prevent the servants of the Company from\r\ncommitting acts of fraud and oppression, that they have nothing to do\r\nbut to amuse themselves with a tour of pleasure to Moorshedabad in order\r\nto put any sum of money in their pocket that they please?\r\n\r\nBut they justify themselves by saying, such things have been practised\r\nbefore. No doubt they have; and these covenants were made that they\r\nshould not be practised any more. But your Lordships are desired to say,\r\nthat the very custom which the covenant is made to destroy, the very\r\ngrievance itself, may be pleaded; the abuse shall be admitted to\r\ndestroy the law made to prevent it. It is impossible, I venture to say,\r\nthat your Lordships should act thus. The conduct of the criminal is not\r\nhalf so abhorrent as the justification is affronting to justice, whilst\r\nit tends to vilify and degrade the dignity of the Peerage and the\r\ncharacter of the Commons of Great Britain, before the former and against\r\nthe latter of which such a justification is produced in the face of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nAt the same time that we call for your justice upon this man, we beseech\r\nyou to remember the severest justice upon him is the tenderest pity\r\ntowards the innocent victims of his crimes. Consider what was at that\r\ntime the state of the people from whom, in direct defiance of his\r\ncovenant, he took this sum of money. Were they at this time richer, were\r\nthey more opulent, was the state of the country more flourishing than\r\nwhen Mr. Sumner, when Mr. Vansittart, in short, than when the long line\r\nof Mr. Hastings's predecessors visited that country? No, they were not.\r\nMr. Hastings at this very time had reduced the Nabob's income from\r\n450,000_l._ [400,000_l._?] sterling a year, exclusive of other\r\nconsiderable domains and revenues, to 160,000_l._ He was, indeed, an\r\nobject of compassion. His revenues had not only been reduced during his\r\nstate of minority, but they were reduced when he afterwards continued in\r\na state in which he could do no one valid act; and yet, in this state,\r\nhe was made competent to give away, under the name of compensation for\r\nentertainments, the sum of 18,000_l._,--perhaps at that time nearly all\r\nhe had in the world.\r\n\r\nLook at your minutes, and you will find Mr. Hastings had just before\r\nthis time said that the bread of ten thousand persons, many of them of\r\nhigh rank, depended upon the means possessed by the Nabob for their\r\nsupport,--that his heart was cut and afflicted to see himself obliged to\r\nruin and starve so many of the Mahometan nobility, the greatest part of\r\nwhose yet remaining miserable allowances were now taken away. You know,\r\nand you will forgive me again remarking, that it is the nature of the\r\neagles and more generous birds of prey to fall upon living, healthy\r\nvictims, but that vultures and carrion crows, and birds of that base and\r\ndegenerate kind, always prey upon dead or dying carcases. It is upon\r\nruined houses, it is upon decayed families, it is upon extinguished\r\nnobility, that Mr. Hastings chooses to prey, and to justify his making\r\nthem his prey.\r\n\r\nBut again we hear, my Lords, that it is a custom, upon ceremonial and\r\ncomplimentary visits, to receive these presents. Do not let us deceive\r\nourselves. Mr. Hastings was there upon no visit either of ceremony or\r\npolitics. He was a member, at that time, of the Committee of Circuit,\r\nwhich went to Moorshedabad for the purpose of establishing a system of\r\nrevenue in the country. He went up upon that business only, as a member\r\nof the Committee of Circuit, for which business he was, like other\r\nmembers of the Committee of Circuit, amply paid, in addition to his\r\nemoluments as Governor, which amounted to about 30,000_l._ a year. Not\r\nsatisfied with those emoluments, and without incurring new known expense\r\nof any kind or sort, he was paid for the extra expenses of his journey,\r\nas appears in your minutes, like other members of the Committee of\r\nCircuit. In fact, he was on no visit there at all. He was merely\r\nexecuting his duty in the settlement of the revenue, as a member of the\r\nCommittee of Circuit. I do not mean to praise the Committee of Circuit\r\nin anyway: God forbid I should!--for we know that it was a committee of\r\nrobbers. He was there as one of that committee, which I am pretty well\r\njustified in describing as I have done, because the Court of Directors,\r\ntogether with the Board of Control, did, in the year 1786, declare that\r\nthe five years' settlement (which originated in that committee) was a\r\nthing bought and sold: your Lordships may read it whenever you please,\r\nin the 80th paragraph of their letter.\r\n\r\nYour Lordships are now fully in possession of all the facts upon which\r\nwe charge the prisoner with peculation, by extorting or receiving large\r\nsums of money, upon pretence of visits, or in compensation of\r\nentertainments. I appeal to your Lordships' consciences for a serious\r\nand impartial consideration of our charge. This is a business not to be\r\nhurried over in the mass, as amongst the acts of a great man, who may\r\nhave his little errors among his great services; no, you cannot, as a\r\njudicial body, huddle all this into a hotchpotch, and decide upon it in\r\na heap. You will have to ask yourselves,--Is this justifiable by his\r\ncovenant? Is this justifiable by law? Is this justifiable, under the\r\ncircumstances of the case, by an enlarged discretion? Is it to be\r\njustified under any principles of humanity? Would it be justifiable by\r\nlocal customs, if such were applicable to the case in question? and even\r\nif it were, is it a practice fit for an English Governor-General to\r\nfollow?\r\n\r\nI dwell the longer upon this, because the fact is avowed; the whole is\r\nan issue of law between us,--whether a Governor-General, in such a case,\r\nought to take such money; and therefore, before I finally dismiss it, I\r\nbeg leave to restate it briefly once more for your Lordships'\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nFirst I wish to leave fixed in your Lordships' minds, what is distinctly\r\nfixed, and shall never go out of ours, that his covenant did not allow\r\nhim to take above four hundred pounds as a present, upon any pretence\r\nwhatsoever.\r\n\r\nYour Lordships will observe we contend, that, if there was a custom,\r\nthis covenant puts an end to that custom. It was declared and intended\r\nso to do. The fact is, that, if such custom existed at all, it was a\r\ncustom applicable only to an ambassador or public minister sent on a\r\nnecessary complimentary visit to a sovereign prince. We deny,\r\npositively, that there is any such general custom. We say, that he never\r\nwas any such minister or that he ever went upon any such complimentary\r\nvisit. We affirm, that, when he took this money, he was doing an act of\r\nquite another nature, and came upon that business only to Moorshedabad,\r\nthe residence of the prince of the country. Now do you call a man who is\r\ngoing to execute a commission, a commission more severe than those\r\nissued against bankrupts, a commission to take away half a man's income,\r\nand to starve a whole body of people dependent upon that income,--do you\r\ncall this a complimentary visit? Is this a visit for which a man is to\r\nhave great entertainments given him? No, the pretence for taking this\r\nmoney is worse than the act itself. When a man is going to execute upon\r\nanother such harsh cruelty, when he is going upon a service at which he\r\nhimself says his mind must revolt, is that precisely the time when he is\r\nto take from his undone host a present, as if he was upon a visit of\r\ncompliment, or about to confer some honor or benefit upon him,--to\r\naugment his revenues, to add to his territories, or to conclude some\r\nvaluable treaty with him? Was this a proper time to take at all from an\r\nhelpless minor so large a sum of money?\r\n\r\nAnd here I shall leave this matter for your Lordships' consideration,\r\nafter reminding you that this poor Nabob is still at Moorshedabad, and\r\nat the mercy of any English gentleman who may choose to take 18,000_l._,\r\nor any other given sum of money from him, after the example of the\r\nprisoner at your bar, if it should be sanctioned by your connivance. Far\r\ndifferent was the example set him by General Clavering. In page 1269\r\nyour Lordships will find the most honorable testimony to the uprightness\r\nand fidelity of this meritorious servant of the Company. It runs thus:\r\n\"Conceiving it to be the intention of the legislature that the\r\nGovernor-General and members of the Council should receive no presents,\r\neither from the Indian powers or any persons whatever, he [General\r\nClavering] has strictly complied, since his arrival here, both with the\r\nspirit and the letter of the act of Parliament, and has accordingly\r\nreturned all the presents which have been made to him.\" I have dwelt\r\nthus long upon this subject, not merely upon account of its own corrupt\r\ncharacter, which has been sufficiently stigmatized by my honorable\r\ncolleague, but upon account of the principle that is laid down by the\r\nprisoner, in his defence of his conduct,--a principle directly leading\r\nto a continuance of the same iniquitous practice, and subversive of\r\nevery attempt to check or control it.\r\n\r\nI must beg leave to recall your Lordships' attention to another, but\r\nsimilar instance of his peculation, another and new mode of taking\r\npresents: I mean, the present which Mr. Hastings took, through Gunga\r\nGovind Sing, from those farmers of the revenues amongst whom he had\r\ndistributed the pillage of the whole country. This scandalous breach of\r\nhis covenant he attempts to justify by the inward intention of his own\r\nmind to apply the money so taken to the public service. Upon this, my\r\nLords, I shall only observe, that this plea of an inward intention in\r\nhis own mind may, if admitted, justify any evil act whatever of this\r\nkind. You have seen how presents from the Nabob are justified; you have\r\nseen how the taking a sum of money or allowance for entertainment,\r\ndirectly contrary to the covenant, how that is attempted to be\r\njustified; you see in what manner he justifies this last-mentioned act\r\nof peculation; and your Lordships will now have to decide upon the\r\nvalidity of these pleas.\r\n\r\nThere still remains, unobserved upon, an instance of his malversation,\r\nwholly new in its kind, to which I will venture to desire your Lordships\r\nvery seriously to turn your attention. In all the causes of peculation\r\nor malversation in office that ever have been tried before this high\r\ncourt, or before any lower court of judicature, in all the judicial\r\nrecords of modern crimes, or of antiquity, you will not find anything in\r\nany degree like it. We have all, in our early education, read the\r\nVerrine Orations. We read them not merely to instruct us, as they will\r\ndo, in the principles of eloquence, and to acquaint us with the manners,\r\ncustoms, and laws of the ancient Romans, of which they are an abundant\r\nrepository, but we may read them from a much higher motive. We may read\r\nthem from a motive which the great author had doubtless in his view,\r\nwhen by publishing them he left to the world and to the latest posterity\r\na monument by which it might be seen what course a great public accuser\r\nin a great public cause ought to pursue, and, as connected with it, what\r\ncourse judges ought to pursue in deciding upon such a cause. In these\r\norations you will find almost every instance of rapacity and peculation\r\nwhich we charge upon Mr. Hastings. Undoubtedly, many Roman and English\r\ngovernors have received corrupt gifts and bribes, under various\r\npretences. But in the cause before your Lordships there is one species\r\nof disgrace, in the conduct of the party accused, which I defy you to\r\nfind in Verres, or in the whole tribe of Roman peculators, in any\r\ngovernor-general, proconsul, or viceroy. I desire you to consider it not\r\nincluded in any other class of crimes, but as a species apart by itself.\r\nIt is an individual, a single case; but it is like the phoenix,--it\r\nmakes a class or species by itself: I mean the business of Nobkissin.\r\nThe money taken from him was not money pretended to be received in lieu\r\nof entertainment; it was not money taken from a farmer-general of\r\nrevenue, out of an idea that his profits were unreasonable, and greater\r\nthan government ought to allow; it was not a donation from a great man,\r\nas an act of his bounty. No, it was a sum of money taken from a private\r\nindividual,--or rather, as has been proved to you by Mr. Larkins, his\r\nown book-keeper, money borrowed, for which he had engaged to give his\r\nbond. That he had actually deposited his bond for this money Mr. Larkins\r\nhas proved to you,--and that the bond was carried to Nobkissin's credit,\r\nin his account with the government. But Mr. Hastings, when he was\r\ncalled upon for the money, withdraws the bond; he will not pay the\r\nmoney; he refused to pay it upon the applications made to him both in\r\nIndia and here at home; and he now comes to your Lordships and says, \"I\r\nborrowed this money, I intended to give my bond for it, as has been\r\nproved before you; but I must have it for my own use.\" We have heard of\r\ngovernors being everything that is bad and wicked; but a governor\r\nputting himself in the situation of a common cheat, of a common\r\nswindler, never was, I believe, heard of since the creation of the world\r\nto this day. This does not taste of the common oppressions of power;\r\nthis does not taste of the common abuses of office; but it in no way\r\ndiffers from one of those base swindling cases that come to be tried and\r\nheavily punished in the King's Bench every day. This is neither more nor\r\nless than a plain, barefaced cheat.\r\n\r\nNow, my Lords, let us see how it is justified. To justify openly and\r\ndirectly a cheat, to justify a fraud upon an individual, is reserved for\r\nour times. But, good Heavens, what a justification have we here! Oh, my\r\nLords, consider into what a state Indian corruption has brought us in\r\nthis country, when any person can be found to come to the bar of the\r\nHouse of Lords and say, \"I did cheat, I did defraud; I did promise, and\r\ngave my bond; I have now withdrawn it, but I will account for it to you\r\nas to a gang of robbers concerned with me in the transaction. I confess\r\nI robbed this man; but I have acted as trustee for the gang. Observe\r\nwhat I have done for the gang. Come forward, Mr. Auriol, and prove what\r\nhandsome budgeros I gave the company: were not they elegantly painted,\r\nbeautifully gilt, charming and commodious? I made use of them as long\r\nas I had occasion; and though they are little worse for wear, and would\r\nhardly suffer the least percentage deduction from prime cost upon them,\r\nI gave them to the company. Oh, I did not put the money into my own\r\npocket. I provided for myself and wore a suit of lace clothes, when I\r\nwas Jew bail for some of this company: it will turn, for it is hardly\r\nthe worse for wear, though I appeared two or three times, in different\r\ncharacters, as bail for you on such and such an occasion. I therefore\r\nset off these items against this money which I gained by swindling on\r\nyour account. It is true I also picked such a one's pocket of a watch;\r\nhere it is; I have worn it as long as it was convenient; now I give the\r\nwatch to the company, and let them send it to the pawnbroker for what it\r\nwill bring. Besides all this, I maintained aide-de-camps for you, and\r\ngave them house-rent.\" (By the way, my Lords, what sort of aide-de-camps\r\nwere these? Who made him a military man, and to have such a legion of\r\naide-de-camps?) \"But,\" says he, \"I paid house-rent for them; that is, in\r\nother words, I paid, at night-cellars and houses in Saint Giles's,\r\nsixpence a week for some of the gang.\" (This, my Lords, is the real\r\nspirit of the whole proceeding, and more especially of the last item in\r\nit.) \"Then,\" says he, \"I was the gang's schoolmaster, and taught lessons\r\non their account. I founded a Mahometan school.\" (Your Lordships have\r\nalready heard something of this shameful affair, of this scene of\r\niniquity,--I think of such iniquity as the world never yet had to blush\r\nat.) \"I founded a Mahometan college for your use; and I bore the expense\r\nof it from September, 1780, when I placed a professor there, called\r\nMudjed-o-Din.\"--This Mudjed-o-Din was to perfect men, by contract, in\r\nall the arts and sciences, in about six months; and the chief purpose of\r\nthe school was, as Mr. Hastings himself tells you, to breed theologians,\r\nmagistrates, and moulavies, that is to say, judges and doctors of law,\r\nwho were to be something like our masters in chancery, the assessors of\r\njudges, to assist them in their judgments. Such was the college founded\r\nby Mr. Hastings, and he soon afterwards appropriated one of the\r\nCompany's estates, (I am speaking of matters of public notoriety,) worth\r\n3,000_l._ a year, for its support. Heaven be praised, that Mr. Hastings,\r\nwhen he was resolved to be pious and munificent, and to be a great\r\nfounder, chose a Mahometan rather than a Christian foundation, so that\r\nour religion was not disgraced by such a foundation!\r\n\r\nObserve how he charges the expense of the foundation to the Company\r\ntwice over. He first makes them set aside an estate of 3,000_l._ a year\r\nfor its support. In what manner this income was applied during Mr.\r\nHastings's stay in India no man living knows; but we know, that, at his\r\ndeparture, one of the last acts he did was to desire it should be put\r\ninto the hands of Mudjed-o-Din. He afterwards, as you have seen, takes\r\ncredit to himself with the Company for the expenses relative to this\r\ncollege.\r\n\r\nI must now introduce your Lordships to the last visitation that was made\r\nof this college. It was visited by order of Lord Cornwallis in the year\r\n1788, upon the complaints made against it which I have already mentioned\r\nto your Lordships,--that it was a sink of filth, vermin, and misery. Mr.\r\nChapman, who was the visitor, and the friend of Mr. Hastings, declares\r\nthat he could not sit in it even for a few minutes; his words are,--\"The\r\nwretched, squalid figures that from every part ran out upon me appeared\r\nto be more like anything else than students.\" In fact, a universal\r\noutcry was raised by the whole city against it, not only as a receptacle\r\nof every kind of abuse, not only of filth and excrements which made it\r\nstink in the natural nostrils, but of worse filth, which made it\r\ninsufferably offensive to the moral nostrils of every inhabitant. Such\r\nis the account given of a college supported at an expense of 3,000_l._ a\r\nyear, (a handsome foundation for a college,) and for building which the\r\nCompany was charged 5,000_l._: though no vouchers of its expenditure\r\nwere ever given by Mr. Hastings. But this is not all. When Lord\r\nCornwallis came to inquire into it, he found that Mudjed-o-Din had sunk\r\nthe income of the estate from 3,000_l._ to 2,000_l._ a year,--in short,\r\nthat it had been a scene of peculation, both by the masters and\r\nscholars, as well as of abandonment to every kind of vicious and\r\nlicentious courses; and all this without the shadow of any benefit\r\nhaving been derived from it. The visitors expressly inquired whether\r\nthere was any good mixed with all this evil; and they found it was all\r\nbad and mischievous, from one end to the other. Your Lordships will\r\nremark, that the greatest part of this disgusting business must have\r\nbeen known to Mr. Hastings when he gave to Mudjed-o-Din the disposal of\r\n3,000_l._ a year. And now, my Lords, can you vote this money, expended\r\nin the manner which I have stated to you, to be a set-off in his favor,\r\nin an account for money which was itself swindled from a private\r\nindividual?\r\n\r\nBut there still remains behind another more serious matter belonging to\r\nthis affair; and I hope you will not think that I am laying too much\r\nstress upon it, when I declare, that, if I were to select from the whole\r\nof his conduct one thing more dishonorable than another to the British\r\nnation, it would be that which I am now about to mention. I will leave\r\nyour Lordships to judge of the sincerity of this declaration, when you\r\nshall have heard read a paper produced by the prisoner in justification\r\nof conduct such as I have stated his to have been. It is the _razinama_,\r\nor attestation, of Munny Begum (the woman whom Mr. Hastings placed in\r\nthe seat of justice in that country) concerning this college, made\r\nprecisely at the time of this inquisition by Lord Cornwallis into the\r\nmanagement of it. Your Lordships will see what sort of things\r\nattestations are from that country: that they are attestations procured\r\nin diametrical contradiction to the certain knowledge of the party\r\nattesting. It is in page 2350 of your Minutes. Indeed, my Lords, these\r\nare pages which, unless they are effaced by your judgment, will rise up\r\nin judgment against us, some day or other.\r\n\r\n     \"He [Mr. Hastings] respected the learned and wise men, and, in\r\n     order for the propagation of learning, he built a college, and\r\n     endowed it with a provision for the maintenance of the students,\r\n     insomuch that thousands reaping the benefits thereof offer up their\r\n     prayers for the prosperity of the King of England, and for the\r\n     success of the Company.\"\r\n\r\nI must here remind your Lordships of another attestation of the same\r\ncharacter, and to the same effect. It comes from Mahomed Reza Khân, who,\r\nas your Lordships will remember, had been reduced by Mr. Hastings from\r\na situation of the highest rank and authority, with an income of\r\nsuitable magnitude, to one of comparative insignificance, with a small\r\nsalary annexed. This man is made to disgrace himself, and to abet the\r\ndisgrace and injury done to his country, by bearing his testimony to the\r\nmerits of this very college.\r\n\r\nI hope your Lordships will never lose sight of this aggravating\r\ncircumstance of the prisoner's criminality,--namely, that you never find\r\nany wicked, fraudulent, and criminal act, in which you do not find the\r\npersons who suffered by it, and must have been well acquainted with it,\r\nto be the very persons who are brought to attest in its favor. O Heaven!\r\nbut let shame for one moment veil its face, let indignation suppress its\r\nfeelings, whilst I again call upon you to view all this as a mere\r\nswindling transaction, in which the prisoner was attempting to defraud\r\nthe Company.\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings has declared, and you will find it upon the Company's\r\nrecords, that this institution (which cost the Company not less than\r\n40,000_l._ in one way or other) did not commence before October in the\r\nyear 1780; and he brings it before the board in April, 1781,--that is,\r\nabout six months after its foundation. Now look at his other account, in\r\nwhich he makes it to begin in the year 1779, and in which he has\r\ntherefore overcharged the expenses of it a whole year.--But Mr. Larkins,\r\nwho kept this latter account for him, may have been inaccurate.--Good\r\nHeavens! where are we? Mr. Hastings, who was bred an accountant, who was\r\nbred in all sorts of trade and business, declares that he keeps no\r\naccounts. Then comes Mr. Larkins, who keeps an account for him; but he\r\nkeeps a false account. Indeed, all the accounts from India, from one\r\nend to another, are nothing but a series of fraud, while Mr. Hastings\r\nwas concerned in them. Mr. Larkins, who keeps his private account just\r\nas his master kept the public accounts, has swindled from the Company a\r\nwhole year's expenses of this college. I should not thus repeatedly\r\ndwell upon this transaction, but because I wish your Lordships to be\r\ncautious how you admit such accounts at all to be given in evidence,\r\ninto the truth of which you cannot penetrate in any regular way. Upon\r\nthe face of the two accounts there is a gross fraud. It is no matter\r\nwhich is true or false, as it is an account which you are in no\r\nsituation to decide upon. I lay down this as a fixed judicial rule, that\r\nno judge ought to receive an account (which, is as serious a part of a\r\njudicial proceeding as can be) the correctness of which he has no means\r\nof ascertaining, but must depend upon the sole word of the accountant.\r\n\r\nHaving stated, therefore, the nature of the offence, which differs\r\nnothing from a common dog-trot fraud, such as we see amongst the meanest\r\nof mankind, your Lordships will be cautious how you admit these, or any\r\nother of his pretended services, to be set off against his crimes. These\r\nstand on record confessed before you; the former, of which you can form\r\nno just estimate, and into which you cannot enter, rest for their truth\r\nupon his own assertions, and they all are found, upon the very face of\r\nthem, to carry marks of fraud as well as of wickedness.\r\n\r\nI have only further to observe to your Lordships, that this\r\nMudjed-o-Din, who, under the patronage of Mr. Hastings, was to do all\r\nthese wonders, Lord Cornwallis turned out of his office with every mark\r\nof disgrace, when he attempted to put into some more respectable state\r\nthat establishment which Mr. Hastings had made a sink of abuse.\r\n\r\nI here conclude all that I have to say upon this business, trusting that\r\nyour Lordships will feel yourselves more offended, and justice more\r\ninsulted, by the defence than by the criminal acts of the prisoner at\r\nyour bar; and that your Lordships will concur with us in thinking, that\r\nto make this unhappy people make these attestations, knowing the direct\r\ncontrary of every word which they say to be the truth, is a shocking\r\naggravation of his guilt. I say they must know it; for Lord Cornwallis\r\ntells you it is notorious; and if you think fit to inquire into it, you\r\nwill find that it was unusually notorious.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy Lords, we have now brought to a conclusion our observations upon the\r\neffects produced by that mass of oppression which we have stated and\r\nproved before your Lordships,--namely, its effects upon the revenues,\r\nand upon the public servants of the Company. We have shown you how\r\ngreatly the former were diminished, and in what manner the latter were\r\nreduced to the worst of all bad states, a state of subserviency to the\r\nwill of the Governor-General. I have shown your Lordships that in this\r\nstate they were not only rendered incapable of performing their own\r\nduty, but were fitted for the worst of all purposes, coöperation with\r\nhim in the perpetration of his criminal acts, and collusion with him in\r\nthe concealment of them. I have lastly to speak of these effects as they\r\nregard the general state and welfare of the country. And here your\r\nLordships will permit me to read the evidence given by Lord Cornwallis,\r\na witness called by the prisoner at your bar, Mr. Hastings himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _The Evidence of Lord Cornwallis. Page 2721._\r\n\r\n     \"_Q._ Whether your Lordship recollects an account that you have\r\n     given to the Court of Directors, in your letter of the 2d of\r\n     August, 1789, concerning the state of those provinces?--_A._ I\r\n     really could not venture to be particular as to any letter I may\r\n     have written so long since, as I have brought no copies of my\r\n     letters with me from India, having left them at Bengal when I went\r\n     to the coast.--_Q._ Whether your Lordship recollects, in any letter\r\n     that you wrote about the 2d of August, 1789, paragraph 18, any\r\n     expressions to this effect, namely: 'I am sorry to be obliged to\r\n     say, that agriculture and internal commerce have for many years\r\n     been gradually declining, and that at present, excepting the class\r\n     of shroffs and banians, who reside almost entirely in great towns,\r\n     the inhabitants of these provinces are advancing hastily to a\r\n     general state of poverty and wretchedness':--whether your Lordship\r\n     recollects that you have written a letter to that effect?--_A._ I\r\n     cannot take upon me to recollect the words of a letter that I have\r\n     written five years ago, but I conclude I must have written to that\r\n     effect.--_Q._ Whether your Lordship recollects that in the\r\n     immediately following paragraph, the 19th, you wrote to this\r\n     effect: 'In this description' (namely, the foregone description) 'I\r\n     must even include almost every zemindar in the Company's\r\n     territories, which, though it may have been partly occasioned by\r\n     their own indolence and extravagance, I am afraid must also be in a\r\n     great measure attributed to the defects of our former system of\r\n     management.' (Paragraph 20.) 'The settlement, in conformity to\r\n     your orders, will only be made for ten years certain, with the\r\n     notification of its being your intention to declare it a perpetual,\r\n     an unalterable assessment of these provinces, if the amount and the\r\n     principles upon which it has been made should meet with your\r\n     approbation':--whether your Lordship recollects to have written\r\n     something to the effect of these two last paragraphs, as well as of\r\n     the first?--_A._ I do recollect that I did write it; but in that\r\n     letter I alluded to the former system of annual assessments.--_Q._\r\n     Whether your Lordship recollects that you wrote, on or about the\r\n     18th of September, 1789, in one of your minutes, thus: 'I may\r\n     safely assert that one third of the Company's territory in\r\n     Hindostan is now a jungle, inhabited only by wild beasts: will a\r\n     ten years' lease induce any proprietor to clear away that jungle,\r\n     and encourage the ryot to come and cultivate his lands, when at the\r\n     end of that lease he must either submit to be taxed _ad libitum_\r\n     for the newly cultivated lands, or lose all hopes of deriving any\r\n     benefit from his labor, for which perhaps by that time he will\r\n     hardly be repaid?'--whether your Lordship recollects a minute to\r\n     that effect?--_A._ I perfectly recollect to have written that\r\n     minute.--_Q._ Now with respect to a letter, dated November the 3d,\r\n     1788, paragraph 38, containing the following sentiments: 'I shall\r\n     therefore only remark in general, that, from frequent changes of\r\n     system or other reasons, much is wanting to establish good order\r\n     and regulations in the internal business of the country, and that,\r\n     from various causes, by far the greatest part of the zemindars, and\r\n     other landholders and renters, are fallen into a state much below\r\n     that of wealth and affluence. This country, however, when the\r\n     fertility of its soil, and the industry and ingenuity of its\r\n     numerous inhabitants are taken into consideration, must\r\n     unquestionably be admitted to be one of the finest in the world;\r\n     and, with the uniform attention of government to moderation in\r\n     exaction, and to a due administration of justice, may long prove a\r\n     source of great riches both to the Company and to Britain.'\r\n     (Paragraph 39.) 'I am persuaded, that, by a train of judicious\r\n     measures, the land revenue of these provinces is capable in time of\r\n     being increased; but, consistent with the principles of humanity,\r\n     and even those of your own interest, it is only by adopting\r\n     measures for the gradual cultivation and improvement of these waste\r\n     lands, and by a gentle and cautious plan for the resumption of\r\n     lands that have been fraudulently alienated, that it ought ever to\r\n     be attempted to be accomplished. Men of speculative and sanguine\r\n     dispositions, and others, either from ignorance of the subject, or\r\n     with views of recommending themselves to your favor, may\r\n     confidently hold forth specious grounds to encourage you to hope\r\n     that a great and immediate accession to that branch of your revenue\r\n     might be practicable. My public duty obliges me to caution you, in\r\n     the most serious manner, against listening to propositions which\r\n     recommend this attempt; because I am clearly convinced, that, if\r\n     carried into execution, they would be attended with the most\r\n     baneful consequences.' (Paragraph 40.) 'Desperate adventurers,\r\n     without fortune or character, would undoubtedly be found, as has\r\n     already been too often experienced, to rent the different districts\r\n     of the country at the highest rates that could be put upon them;\r\n     that [but?] the delusion would be of a short duration, and the\r\n     impolicy and inhumanity of the plan would, when perhaps too late\r\n     for effectual remedy, become apparent by the complaints of the\r\n     people and the disappointments at the treasury in the payments of\r\n     the revenue, and would probably terminate in the ruin and\r\n     depopulation of the unfortunate country':--whether your Lordship\r\n     recollects to have written anything to that effect about that\r\n     time?--_A._ I perfectly recollect having written the extracts that\r\n     have been read.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, Lord Cornwallis has been called, he has been examined before\r\nyou. We stopped our proceedings ten days for the purpose of taking his\r\nevidence. We do not regret this delay. And he has borne the testimony\r\nwhich you have heard to the effects of Mr. Hastings's government of a\r\ncountry once the most fertile and cultivated, of a people the most\r\nindustrious, flourishing, and happy,--that the one was wasted and\r\ndesolated, the other reduced to a condition of want and misery, and that\r\nthe zemindars, that is, the nobility and gentry of the country, were so\r\nbeggared as not to be able to give even a common decent education to\r\ntheir children, notwithstanding the foundation of Mr. Hastings's\r\ncolleges. You have heard this noble person, who had been an eye-witness\r\nof what he relates, supplicating for their relief, and expressly stating\r\nthat most of the complicated miseries, and perhaps the cruelest of the\r\nafflictions they endured, arose from the management of the country\r\nhaving been taken out of the hands of its natural rulers, and given up\r\nto Mr. Hastings's farmers, namely, the banians of Calcutta. These are\r\nthe things that ought to go to your Lordships' hearts. You see a country\r\nwasted and desolated. You see a third of it become a jungle for wild\r\nbeasts. You see the other parts oppressed by persons in the form and\r\nshape of men, but with all the character and disposition of beasts of\r\nprey. This state of the country is brought before you, and by the most\r\nunexceptionable evidence,--being brought forward through Mr. Hastings\r\nhimself. This evidence, whatever opinion you may entertain of the\r\neffrontery or of the impudence of the criminal who has produced it, is\r\nof double and treble force. And yet at the very time when Lord\r\nCornwallis is giving this statement of the country and its inhabitants,\r\nat the very time when he is calling for pity upon their condition, are\r\nthese people brought forward to bear testimony to the benign and\r\nauspicious government of Mr. Hastings, directed, as your Lordships know\r\nit was, by the merciful and upright Gunga Govind Sing.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, you have now the evidence of Lord Cornwallis on the one hand,\r\nand the razinamas of India on the other. But before I dismiss this part\r\nof my subject, I must call your Lordships' attention to another\r\nauthority,--to a declaration, strictly speaking, _legal_, of the state\r\nto which our Indian provinces were reduced, and of the oppressions which\r\nthey have suffered, during the government of Mr. Hastings: I speak of\r\nthe act 24 Geo. III. cap. 25, intituled, \"An act for the better\r\nregulation and management of the affairs of the East India Company, and\r\nof the British possessions in India, and for establishing a court of\r\njudicature for the more speedy and effectual trial of persons accused of\r\noffences committed in the East Indies,\" § 39.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, here is an act of Parliament; here are regulations enacted in\r\nconsequence of an inquiry which had been directed to be made into the\r\ngrievances of India, for the redress of them. This act of Parliament\r\ndeclares the existence of oppressions in the country. What oppressions\r\nwere they? The oppressions which it suffered by being let out to the\r\nfarmers of the Company's revenues. Who was the person that sold these\r\nrevenues to the farmers? Warren Hastings. By whom were these oppressions\r\nnotified to the Court of Directors? By Lord Cornwallis. Upon what\r\noccasion were these letters written by my Lord Cornwallis? They were\r\nanswers to inquiries made by the Court of Directors, and ordered by an\r\nact of Parliament to be made. The existence, then, of the grievances,\r\nand the cause of them, are expressly declared in an act of Parliament.\r\nIt orders an inquiry; and Lord Cornwallis, in consequence of that\r\ninquiry, transmits to the Court of Directors this very information; he\r\ngives you this identical state of the country: so that it is\r\nconsolidated, mixed, and embodied with an act of Parliament itself,\r\nwhich no power on earth, I trust, but the power that made it, can shake.\r\nI trust, I say, that neither we, the Commons, nor you, the Lords, nor\r\nhis Majesty, the sovereign of this country, can shake one word of this\r\nact of Parliament,--can invalidate the truth of its declaration, or the\r\nauthority of the persons, men of high honor and character, that made\r\nthat inquiry and this report. Your Lordships must repeal this act in\r\norder to acquit Mr. Hastings.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Hastings and his counsel have produced evidence against this act\r\nof Parliament, against the order of the Court of Directors by which an\r\ninquiry and report were made under that act, against Lord Cornwallis's\r\nreturn to that inquiry; and now, once for all, hear what the miserable\r\nwretches are themselves made to say, to invalidate the act of\r\nParliament, to invalidate the authority of the Court of Directors, to\r\ninvalidate the evidence of an official return of Lord Cornwallis under\r\nthe act. Pray hear what these miserable creatures describe as an\r\nelysium, speaking with rapture of their satisfaction, under the\r\ngovernment of Mr. Hastings.\r\n\r\n     \"All we zemindars, chowdries, and talookdars of the district of\r\n     Akbarnagur, commonly called Rajamahal, in the kingdom of Bengal,\r\n     have heard that the gentlemen in England are displeased with Mr.\r\n     Hastings, on suspicion that he oppressed us inhabitants of this\r\n     place, took our money by deceit and force, and ruined the country;\r\n     therefore we, upon the strength of our religion and religious\r\n     tenets, which we hold as a duty upon us, and in order to act\r\n     conformable to the duties of God in delivering evidence, relate the\r\n     praiseworthy actions, full of prudence and rectitude, friendship\r\n     and politeness, of Mr. Hastings, possessed of great abilities and\r\n     understanding, and, by representing facts, remove the doubts that\r\n     have possessed the minds of the gentlemen in England;--that Mr.\r\n     Hastings distributed protection and security to religion, and\r\n     kindness and peace to all; he is free from the charge of\r\n     embezzlement and fraud, and that his heart is void of covetousness\r\n     and avidity; during the period of his government, no one\r\n     experienced from him other than protection and justice, never\r\n     having felt hardships from him, nor did the poor ever know the\r\n     weight of an oppressive hand from him; our characters and\r\n     reputations have always been guarded in quiet from attack by the\r\n     vigilance of his power and foresight, and preserved by the terror\r\n     of his justice; he never omitted the smallest instance of kindness\r\n     and goodness towards us and those entitled to it, but always\r\n     applied by soothings and mildness the salve of comfort to the\r\n     wounds of affliction, not allowing a single person to be\r\n     overwhelmed by despair; he displayed his friendship and kindness to\r\n     all; he destroyed the power of the enemies and wicked men by the\r\n     strength of his terror; he tied the hands of tyrants and oppressors\r\n     by his justice, and by this conduct he secured happiness and joy to\r\n     us; he reëstablished the foundation of justice, and we at all\r\n     times, during his government, lived in comfort and passed our days\r\n     in peace; we are many, many of us satisfied and pleased with him.\r\n     As Mr. Hastings was perfectly well acquainted with the manners and\r\n     customs of these countries, he was always desirous of performing\r\n     that which would tend to the preservation of our religion, and of\r\n     the duties of our sects, and guard the religious customs of each\r\n     from the effects of misfortune and accidents; in every sense he\r\n     treated us with attention and respect. We have represented without\r\n     deceit what we have ourselves seen, and the facts that happened\r\n     from him.\"\r\n\r\nThis, my Lords, is in page 2374 of the printed Minutes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy Lords, we spare you the reading of a great number of these\r\nattestations; they are all written in the same style; and it must appear\r\nto your Lordships a little extraordinary, that, as they are said to be\r\ntotally voluntary, as the people are represented to be crowding to make\r\nthese testimonials, there should be such an unison in the heart to\r\nproduce a language that is so uniform as not to vary so much as in a\r\nsingle tittle,--that every part of the country, every province, every\r\ndistrict, men of every caste and of every religion, should all unite in\r\nexpressing their sentiments in the very same words and in the very same\r\nphrases. I must fairly say it is a kind of miraculous concurrence, a\r\nmiraculous gratitude. Mr. Hastings says that gratitude is lost in this\r\npart of the world. There it blooms and flourishes in a way not to be\r\ndescribed. In proportion as you hear of the miseries and distresses of\r\nthese very people, in the same proportion do they express their comfort\r\nand satisfaction, and that they never knew what a grievance was of any\r\nsort. Lord Cornwallis finds them aggrieved, the Court of Directors find\r\nthem aggrieved, the Parliament of Great Britain find them aggrieved, and\r\nthe court here find them aggrieved; but they never found themselves\r\naggrieved. Their being turned out of house and home, and having all\r\ntheir land given to farmers of revenue for five years to riot in and\r\ndespoil them of all they had, is what fills them with rapture. They are\r\nthe only people, I believe, upon the face of the earth, that have no\r\ncomplaints to make of their government, in any instance whatever. Theirs\r\nmust be something superior to the government of angels; for I verily\r\nbelieve, that, if one out of the choir of the heavenly angels were sent\r\nto govern the earth, such is the nature of man, that many would be found\r\ndiscontented with it. But these people have no complaint, they feel no\r\nhardships, no sorrow; Mr. Hastings has realized more than the golden\r\nage. I am ashamed for human nature, I am ashamed for our government, I\r\nam ashamed for this court of justice, that these things are brought\r\nbefore us; but here they are, and we must observe upon them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy Lords, we have done, on our part; we have made out our case; and it\r\nonly remains for me to make a few observations upon what Mr. Hastings\r\nhas thought proper to put forward in his defence. Does he meet our case\r\nwith anything but these general attestations, upon which I must first\r\nremark, that there is not one single matter of fact touched upon in\r\nthem? Your Lordships will observe, and you may hunt them out through the\r\nwhole body of your minutes, that you do not find a single fact mentioned\r\nin any of them. But there is an abundance of panegyric; and if we were\r\ndoing nothing but making satires, as the newspapers charge us with\r\ndoing, against Mr. Hastings, panegyric would be a good answer.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Hastings sets up pleas of merit upon this occasion. Now,\r\nundoubtedly, no plea of merit can be admitted to extinguish, as your\r\nLordships know very well, a direct charge of crime. Merit cannot\r\nextinguish crime. For instance, if Lord Howe, to whom this country owes\r\nso much as it owes this day for the great and glorious victory which\r\nmakes our hearts glad, and I hope will insure the security of this\r\ncountry,--yet if Lord Howe, I say, was charged with embezzling the\r\nKing's stores, or applying them in any manner unbecoming his situation,\r\nto any shameful or scandalous purpose,--if he was accused of taking\r\nadvantage of his station, to oppress any of the captains of his\r\nships,--if he was stated to have gone into a port of the allies of this\r\ncountry, and to have plundered the inhabitants, to have robbed their\r\nwomen, and broken into the recesses of their apartments,--if he had\r\ncommitted atrocities like these, his glorious victory could not change\r\nthe nature and quality of such acts. My Lord Malmesbury has been lately\r\nsent to the King of Prussia; we hope and trust that his embassy will be\r\nsuccessful, and that this country will derive great benefit from his\r\nnegotiations; but if Lord Malmesbury, from any subsidy that was to be\r\npaid to the King of Prussia, was to put 50,000_l._ in his own pocket, I\r\nbelieve that his making a good and advantageous treaty with the King of\r\nPrussia would never be thought a good defence for him. We admit, that,\r\nif a man has done great and eminent services, though they cannot be a\r\ndefence against a charge of crimes, and cannot obliterate them, yet,\r\nwhen sentence comes to be passed upon such a man, you will consider,\r\nfirst, whether his transgressions were common lapses of human frailty,\r\nand whether the nature and weight of the grievances resulting from them\r\nwere light in comparison with the services performed. I say that you\r\ncannot acquit him; but your Lordships might think some pity due to him,\r\nthat might mitigate the severity of your sentence. In the second place,\r\nyou would consider whether the evidence of the services alleged to be\r\nperformed was as clear and undoubted as that of the crimes charged. I\r\nconfess, that, if a man has done great services, it may be some\r\nalleviation of lighter faults; but then they ought to be urged as\r\nsuch,--with modesty, with humility, with confession of the faults, and\r\nnot with a proud and insolent defiance. They should not be stated as\r\nproofs that he stands justified in the eye of mankind for committing\r\nunexampled and enormous crimes. Indeed, humility, suppliant guilt,\r\nalways makes impression in our bosoms, so that, when we see it before\r\nus, we always remember that we are all frail men; and nothing but a\r\nproud defiance of law and justice can make us forget this for one\r\nmoment. I believe the Commons of Great Britain, and I hope the persons\r\nthat speak to you, know very well how to allow for the faults and\r\nfrailties of mankind equitably.\r\n\r\nLet us now see what are the merits which Mr. Hastings has set up against\r\nthe just vengeance of his country, and against his proved delinquencies.\r\nFrom the language of the prisoner, and of his counsel, you would imagine\r\nsome great, known, acknowledged services had been done by him. Your\r\nLordships recollect that most of these presumed services have been\r\nconsidered, and we are persuaded justly considered, as in themselves\r\ncrimes. He wishes your Lordships to suppose and believe that these\r\nservices were put aside either because we could not prove the facts\r\nagainst him or could not make out that they were criminal, and\r\nconsequently that your Lordships ought to presume them to have been\r\nmeritorious; and this is one of the grounds upon which he demands to be\r\nacquitted of the charges that have been brought forward and proved\r\nagainst him. Finding in our proceedings, and recorded upon our journals,\r\nan immense mass of criminality with which he is charged, and finding\r\nthat we had selected, as we were bound to select, such parts as might be\r\nmost conveniently brought before your Lordships, (for to have gone\r\nthrough the whole would have been nearly impossible,) he takes all the\r\nrest that we have left behind and have not brought here as charges, and\r\nconverts them, by a strange metamorphosis, into merits.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, we must insist, on the part of the House of Commons, we must\r\nconjure your Lordships, for the honor of a coördinate branch of the\r\nlegislature, that, whenever you are called upon to admit what we have\r\ncondemned as crimes to be merits, you will at least give us an\r\nopportunity of being heard upon the matter,--that you will not suffer\r\nMr. Hastings, when attempting to defend himself against our charges, in\r\nan indirect and oblique manner to condemn or censure the House of\r\nCommons itself, as having misrepresented to be crimes the acts of a\r\nmeritorious servant of the public. Mr. Hastings has pleaded a variety of\r\nmerits, and every one of these merits, without the exception of one of\r\nthem, have been either directly censured by the House of Commons, and\r\ncensured as a ground for legislative provision, or they remain upon the\r\nrecords of the House of Commons, with the vouchers for them, and proofs;\r\nand though we have not actually come to the question upon every one of\r\nthem, we had come, before the year 1782, to forty-five direct\r\nresolutions upon his conduct. These resolutions were moved by a person\r\nto whom this country is under many obligations, and whom we must always\r\nmention with honor, whenever we are speaking of high situations in this\r\ncountry, and of great talents to support them, and of long public\r\nservices in the House of Commons: I mean Mr. Dundas, then Lord Advocate\r\nof Scotland, and now one of the principal Secretaries of State, and at\r\nthe head, and worthily and deservedly at the head, of the East Indian\r\ndepartment. This distinguished statesman moved forty-five resolutions,\r\nthe major part of them directly condemning these very acts which Mr.\r\nHastings has pleaded as his merits, as being delinquencies and crimes.\r\nAll that the House of Commons implore of your Lordships is, that you\r\nwill not take these things, which we call crimes, to be merits, without\r\nhearing the House of Commons upon the subject-matter of them. I am sure\r\nyou are too noble and too generous, as well as too just and equitable,\r\nto act in such a manner.\r\n\r\nThe first thing that Mr. Hastings brings forward in his defence is,\r\nthat, whereas the Company were obliged to pay a certain tribute to the\r\nMogul, in consideration of a grant by which the Moguls gave to us the\r\nlegal title under which we hold the provinces of Bengal, Bahar, and\r\nOrissa, he did stop the payment of that tribute, or acknowledgment,\r\nsmall as it was,--that, though bound by a treaty recognized by the\r\nCompany and recognized by the nation, though bound by the very sunnud by\r\nwhich he held the very office he was exercising, yet he had broken the\r\ntreaty, and refused to pay the stipulated acknowledgment. Where are we,\r\nmy Lords? Is this merit? Good God Almighty! the greatest blockhead, the\r\nmost ignorant, miserable wretch, a person without either virtue or\r\ntalents, has nothing to do but to order a clerk to strike a pen through\r\nsuch an account, and then to make a merit of it to you. \"Oh!\" says he,\r\n\"I have by a mere breach of your faith, by a single dash of my pen,\r\nsaved you all this money which you were bound to pay. I have exonerated\r\nyou from the payment of it. I have gained you 250,000_l._ a year\r\nforever. Will you not reward a person who did you such a great and\r\nimportant service, by conniving a little at his delinquencies?\"\r\n\r\nBut the House of Commons will not allow that this was a great and\r\nimportant service; on the contrary, they have declared the act itself to\r\nbe censurable. There is our resolution,--Resolution the 7th:--\r\n\r\n\"That the conduct of the Company and their servants in India to the\r\nKing,\" (meaning the Mogul king) \"and Nudjif Khân, with respect to the\r\ntribute payable to the one, and the stipend to the other, and with\r\nrespect to the transfer of the provinces of Corah, and Allahabad to the\r\nVizier, was contrary to policy and good faith; and that such wise and\r\npracticable measures should be adopted in future as may tend to redeem\r\nthe national honor, and recover the confidence and attachment of the\r\nprinces of India.\"\r\n\r\nThis act of injustice, against which we have fulminated the thunder of\r\nour resolutions as a heavy crime, as a crime that dishonored the nation,\r\nand which measures ought to be taken to redress, this man has the\r\ninsolence to bring before your Lordships as a set-off against the crimes\r\nwe charge him with. This outrageous defiance of the House of Commons,\r\nthis outrageous defiance of all the laws of his country, I hope your\r\nLordships will not countenance. You will not let it pass for nothing: on\r\nthe contrary, you will consider it as aggravating heavily his crimes.\r\nAnd, above all, you will not suffer him to set off this, which we have\r\ndeclared to be injurious to our national honor and credit, and which he\r\nhimself does not deny to be a breach of the public faith, against other\r\nbreaches of the public faith with which we charge him,--or to justify\r\none class of public crimes by proving that he has committed others.\r\n\r\nYour Lordships see that he justifies this crime upon the plea of its\r\nbeing profitable to the Company; but he shall not march off even on this\r\nground with flying colors. My Lords, pray observe in what manner he\r\ncalculates these profits. Your Lordships will find that he makes up the\r\naccount of them much in the same manner as he made up the account of\r\nNobkissin's money. There is, indeed, no account which he has ever\r\nbrought forth that does not carry upon it not only ill faith and\r\nnational dishonor, but direct proofs of corruption. When Mr. Hastings\r\nvalues himself upon this shocking and outrageous breach of faith, which\r\nrequired nothing but a base and illiberal mind, without either talents,\r\ncourage, or skill, except that courage which defies all consequences,\r\nwhich defies shame, which defies the judgment and opinion of his country\r\nand of mankind, no other talents than may be displayed by the dash of a\r\npen, you will at least expect to see a clear and distinct account of\r\nwhat was gained by it.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1775, at a period when Mr. Hastings was under an eclipse,\r\nwhen honor and virtue, in the character of General Clavering, Colonel\r\nMonson, and Mr. Francis, sat for a short period at the\r\nCouncil-Board,--during that time, Mr. Hastings's conduct upon this\r\noccasion was called into question. They called for an account of the\r\nrevenues of the country,--what was received, and what had been paid; and\r\nin the account returned they found the amount of the tribute due to the\r\nMogul, 250,000_l._, entered as paid up to October, 1774. Thus far all\r\nappeared fair upon the face of it; they took it for granted, as your\r\nLordships would take it for granted, at the first view, that the tribute\r\nin reality had been paid up to the time stated. The books were balanced:\r\nyou find a debtor; you find a creditor; every item posted in as regular\r\na manner as possible. Whilst they were examining this account, a Mr.\r\nCroftes, of whom your Lordships have heard very often, as\r\naccountant-general, comes forward and declares that there was a little\r\nerror in the account. And what was the error? That he had entered the\r\nMogul's tribute for one year more than it had actually been paid. Here\r\nwe have the small error of a payment to the Mogul of 250,000_l._ This\r\nappeared strange. \"Why,\" says Mr. Croftes, \"I never discovered it; nor\r\nwas it ever intimated to me that it had been stopped from October, 1773,\r\ntill the other day, when I was informed that I ought not to have made an\r\nentry of the last payments.\" These were his expressions. You will find\r\nthe whole relation in the Bengal Appendix, printed by the orders of the\r\nCourt of Directors. When Mr. Croftes was asked a very natural question,\r\n\"Who first told you of your mistake? who acquainted you with Mr.\r\nHastings's orders that the payment should be expunged from the account?\"\r\nwhat is his answer? It is an answer worthy of Mr. Middleton, an answer\r\nworthy of Mr. Larkins, or of any of the other white banians of Mr.\r\nHastings:--\"Oh, I have forgotten.\" Here you have an accountant-general\r\nkept in ignorance, or who pretends to be ignorant, of so large a payment\r\nas 250,000_l._; who enters it falsely in his account; and when asked who\r\napprised him of his mistake, says that he has really forgotten.\r\n\r\nOh, my Lords, what resources there are in oblivion! what resources there\r\nare in bad memory! No genius ever has done so much for mankind as this\r\nmental defect has done for Mr. Hastings's accountants. It was said by\r\none of the ancient philosophers, to a man who proposed to teach people\r\nmemory,--\"I wish you could teach me oblivion; I wish you could teach me\r\nto forget.\" These people have certainly not been taught the art of\r\nmemory, but they appear perfect masters of the art of forgetting. My\r\nLords, this is not all; and I must request your Lordships' attention to\r\nthe whole of the account, as it appears in the account of the arrears\r\ndue to the King, annexed to your minutes. Here is a kind of labyrinth,\r\nwhere fraud runs into fraud. On the credit side you find stated there,\r\neight lacs paid to the Vizier, and to be taken from the Mogul's tribute,\r\nfor the support of an army, of which he himself had stipulated to bear\r\nthe whole expenses. These eight lacs are thus fraudulently accounted for\r\nupon the face of the thing; and with respect to eighteen lacs, the\r\nremainder of the tribute, there is no account given of it at all. This\r\nsum Mr. Hastings must, therefore, have pocketed for his own use, or that\r\nof his gang of peculators; and whilst he was pretending to save you\r\neight lacs by one fraud, he committed another fraud of eighteen lacs for\r\nhimself: and this is the method by which one act of peculation begets\r\nanother in the economy of fraud.\r\n\r\nThus much of these affairs I think myself bound to state to your\r\nLordships upon this occasion; for, although not one word has been\r\nproduced by the counsel to support the allegations of the prisoner at\r\nyour bar, yet, knowing that your Lordships, high as you are, are still\r\nbut men, knowing also that bold assertions and confident declarations\r\nare apt to make some impression upon all men's minds, we oppose his\r\nallegations. But how do we oppose them? Not by things of the like\r\nnature. We oppose them by showing you that the House of Commons, after\r\ndiligent investigation, has condemned them, and by stating the grounds\r\nupon which the House founded its condemnation. We send you to the\r\nrecords of the Company, if you want to pursue this matter further, to\r\nenlighten your own minds upon the subject. Do not think, my Lords, that\r\nwe are not aware how ridiculous it is for either party, the accuser or\r\nthe accused, to make here any assertions without producing vouchers for\r\nthem: we know it; but we are prepared and ready to take upon us the\r\nproof; and we should be ashamed to assert anything that we are not able\r\ndirectly to substantiate by an immediate reference to uncontradicted\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the merits pleaded by the prisoner, we could efface that\r\nplea with a single stroke, by saying there is no evidence before your\r\nLordships of any such merits. But we have done more: we have shown you\r\nthat the things which he has set up as merits are atrocious crimes, and\r\nthat there is not one of them which does not, in the very nature and\r\ncircumstances of it, carry evidence of base corruption, as well as of\r\nflagrant injustice and notorious breach of public faith.\r\n\r\nThe next thing that he takes credit for is precisely an act of this\r\ndescription. The Mogul had, by solemn stipulation with the Company, a\r\nroyal domain insured to him, consisting of two provinces, Corah and\r\nAllahabad. Of both these provinces Mr. Hastings deprived the Mogul, upon\r\nweak pretences, if proved in point of fact, but which were never proved\r\nin any sense, against him. I allude particularly to his alleged alliance\r\nwith the Mahrattas,--a people, by the way, with whom we were not then\r\nat war, and with whom he had as good a right as Nudjif Khân to enter\r\ninto alliance at that time. He takes these domains, almost the last\r\nwrecks of empire left to the descendant of Tamerlane, from the man, I\r\nsay, to whose voluntary grants we owe it that we have put a foot in\r\nBengal. Surely, we ought, at least, to have kept our faith in leaving\r\nthis last retreat to that unfortunate prince. The House of Commons was\r\nof that opinion, and consequently they resolved, \"That the transfer of\r\nCorah and Allahabad to the Vizier was contrary to policy and good\r\nfaith.\" This is what the Commons think of this business which Mr.\r\nHastings pleads as merits.\r\n\r\nBut I have not yet done with it. These provinces are estimated as worth\r\ntwenty-two lacs, or thereabouts, that is, about 220,000_l._, a year. I\r\nbelieve they were improvable to a good deal more. But what does Mr.\r\nHastings do? Instead of taking them into the Company's possession for\r\nthe purpose of preserving them for the Mogul, upon the event of our\r\nbeing better satisfied with his conduct, or of appropriating them to the\r\nCompany's advantage, he sells them to the Nabob of Oude, who he knew had\r\nthe art, above all men, of destroying a country which he was to keep, or\r\nwhich he might fear he was not to keep, permanent possession of. And\r\nwhat do you think he sold them for? He sold them at a little more than\r\ntwo years' purchase. Will any man believe that Mr. Hastings, when he\r\nsold these provinces to the Vizier for two years' purchase, and when\r\nthere was no man that would not have given ten years' purchase for them,\r\ndid not put the difference between the real and pretended value into his\r\nown pocket, and that of his associates?\r\n\r\nWe charge, therefore, first, that this act for which he assumes merit\r\nwas in itself a breach of faith; next, that the sale of these provinces\r\nwas scandalously conducted; and thirdly, that this sale, at one fifth of\r\nthe real value, was effected for corrupt purposes. Thus an act of\r\nthreefold delinquency is one of the merits stated with great pomp by his\r\ncounsel.\r\n\r\nAnother of his merits is the stoppage of the pension which the Company\r\nwas under an obligation to pay to Nudjif Khân: a matter which, even if\r\nadmitted to be a merit, is certainly not worth, as a set-off, much\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nBut there is another set-off of merit upon which he plumes himself, and\r\nsets an exceedingly high value: the sale of the Rohilla nation to that\r\nworthless tyrant, the Vizier, their cruel and bitter enemy,--the\r\ncruelest tyrant, perhaps, that ever existed, and their most implacable\r\nenemy, if we except Mr. Hastings, who appears to have had a concealed\r\ndegree of animosity, public, private, or political, against them. To\r\nthis man he sold this whole nation, whose country, cultivated like a\r\ngarden, was soon reduced, as Mr. Hastings, from the character of the\r\nVizier, knew would be the consequence, to a mere desert, for 400,000_l._\r\nHe sent a brigade of our troops to assist the Vizier in extirpating\r\nthese people, who were the bravest, the most honorable, and generous\r\nnation upon earth. Those who were not left slaughtered to rot upon the\r\nsoil of their native country were cruelly expelled from it, and sent to\r\npublish the merciless and scandalous behavior of Great Britain from one\r\nend of India to the other. I believe there is not an honest, ingenuous,\r\nor feeling heart upon the face of the globe, I believe there is no man\r\npossessing the least degree of regard to honor and justice, humanity\r\nand good policy, that did not reprobate this act. The Court of\r\nDirectors, when they heard of it, reprobated it in the strongest manner;\r\nthe Court of Proprietors reprobated it in the strongest manner; by the\r\nHouse of Commons, after the most diligent investigation, it was, in a\r\nresolution moved by Mr. Dundas, reprobated in the strongest manner: and\r\nthis is the act which Mr. Hastings brings forward before your Lordships\r\nas a merit.\r\n\r\nBut, again, I can prove that in this, perhaps the most atrocious of all\r\nhis demerits, there is a most horrid and nefarious secret corruption\r\nlurking. I can tell your Lordships that Sir Robert Barker was offered by\r\nthis Vizier, for about one half of this very country, namely, the\r\ncountry of the Rohillas, a sum of fifty lacs of rupees,--that is,\r\n500,000_l._ Mr. Hastings was informed of this offer by Sir Robert\r\nBarker, in his letter of the 24th March, 1773. Still, in the face of\r\nthis information, Mr. Hastings took for the Company only forty lacs of\r\nrupees. I leave your Lordships to draw your own conclusion from these\r\nfacts. You will judge what became of the difference between the price\r\noffered and the price accounted for as taken. Nothing on earth can hide\r\nfrom mankind why Mr. Hastings made this wicked, corrupt bargain for the\r\nextermination of a brave and generous people,--why he took 400,000_l._\r\nfor the whole of that, for half of which he was offered and knew he\r\nmight have had 500,000_l._\r\n\r\nYour Lordships will observe, that for all these facts there is no\r\nevidence, on the one side or on the other, directly before you. Their\r\nmerits have been insisted upon, in long and laborious details and\r\ndiscussions, both by Mr. Hastings himself and by his counsel. We have\r\nanswered them for that reason; but we answer them with a direct\r\nreference to records and papers, from which your Lordships may judge of\r\nthem as set-offs and merits. I believe your Lordships will now hardly\r\nreceive them as merits to set off guilt, since in every one of them\r\nthere is both guilt in the act, and strong ground for presuming that he\r\nhad corruptly taken money for himself.\r\n\r\nThe last act of merit that has been insisted upon by his counsel is the\r\nMahratta peace. They have stated to you the distresses of the Company to\r\njustify the unhandsome and improper means that he took of making this\r\npeace. Mr. Hastings himself has laid hold of the same opportunity of\r\nmagnifying the difficulties which, during his government, he had to\r\ncontend with. Here he displays all his tactics. He spreads all his\r\nsails, and here catches every gale. He says, \"I found all India\r\nconfederated against you. I found not the Mahrattas alone; I found war\r\nthrough a hundred hostile states fulminated against you; I found the\r\nPeshwa, the Nizam, Hyder Ali, the Rajah of Berar, all combined together\r\nfor your destruction. I stemmed the torrent: fortitude is my character.\r\nI faced and overcame all these difficulties, till I landed your affairs\r\nsafe on shore, till I stood the saviour of India.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, we of the House of Commons have before heard all this; but we\r\ncannot forget that we examined into every part of it, and that we did\r\nnot find a single fact stated by him that was not a ground of censure\r\nand reprobation. The House of Commons, in the resolutions to which I\r\nhave alluded, have declared, that Mr. Hastings, the first author of\r\nthese proceedings, took advantage of an ambiguous letter of the Court\r\nof Directors to break and violate the most solemn, the most\r\nadvantageous, and useful treaty that the Company had ever made in India;\r\nand that this conduct of his produced the strange and unnatural junction\r\nwhich he says he found formed against the Company, and with which he had\r\nto combat. I should trouble your Lordships with but a brief statement of\r\nthe facts; and if I do not enter more at large in observing upon them,\r\nit is because I cannot but feel shocked at the indecency and impropriety\r\nof your being obliged to hear of that as merit which the House of\r\nCommons has condemned in every part. Your Lordships received obliquely\r\nevidence from the prisoner at your bar upon this subject; yet, when we\r\ncame and desired your full inquiry into it, your Lordships, for wise and\r\njust reasons, I have no doubt, refused our request. I must, however,\r\nagain protest on the part of the Commons against your Lordships\r\nreceiving such evidence at all as relevant to your judgment, unless the\r\nHouse of Commons is fully heard upon it.\r\n\r\nBut to proceed.--The government of Bombay had offended the Mahratta\r\nStates by a most violent and scandalous aggression. They afterwards made\r\na treaty of peace with them, honorable and advantageous to the Company.\r\nThis treaty was made by Colonel Upton, and is called the Treaty of\r\nPoorunder. Mr. Hastings broke that treaty, upon his declared principle,\r\nthat you are to look in war for the resources of your government. All\r\nIndia was at that time in peace. Hyder Ali did not dare to attack us,\r\nbecause he was afraid that his natural enemies, the Mahrattas, would\r\nfall upon him. The Nizam could not attack us, because he was also afraid\r\nof the Mahrattas. The Mahratta state itself was divided into such\r\ndiscordant branches as to make it impossible for them to unite in any\r\none object; that commonwealth, which, certainly at that time was the\r\nterror of India, was so broken, as to render it either totally\r\nineffective or easy to be resisted. There was not one government in\r\nIndia that did not look up to Great Britain as holding the balance of\r\npower, and in a position to control and do justice to every individual\r\nparty in it. At that juncture Mr. Hastings deliberately broke the treaty\r\nof Poorunder; and afterwards, by breaking faith with and attacking all\r\nthe powers, one after another, he produced that very union which one\r\nwould hardly have expected that the incapacity or ill faith of any\r\nGovernor could have effected. Your Lordships shall hear the best and\r\nmost incontrovertible evidence both of his incapacity and ill faith, and\r\nof the consequences which they produced. It is the declaration of one of\r\nthe latest of their allies concerning all these proceedings. It is\r\ncontained in a letter from the Rajah of Berar, directly and strongly\r\ninculpating Mr. Hastings, upon facts which he has never denied and by\r\narguments which he has never refuted, as being himself the cause of that\r\nvery junction of all the powers of India against us.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Letter from Benaram Pundit._\r\n\r\n     \"As the friendship of the English is, at all events, the first and\r\n     most necessary consideration, I will therefore exert myself in\r\n     establishing peace: for the power of making peace with all is the\r\n     best object; to this all other measures are subservient, and will\r\n     certainly be done by them, the English. You write, that, after\r\n     having laid the foundation of peace with the Pundit Purdhaun, it\r\n     is requisite that some troops should be sent with General Goddard\r\n     against Hyder Naig, and take possession of his country, when all\r\n     those engagements and proposals may be assented to. My reason is\r\n     confounded in discussing this suggestion, at a time when Hyder Naig\r\n     is in every respect in alliance with the Peshwa, and has assisted\r\n     with his soul and life to repel the English. For us to unite our\r\n     troops with those of the enemy and extirpate him, would not this\r\n     fix the stamp of infamy upon us forever? Would any prince, for\r\n     generations to come, ever after assist us, or unite with the\r\n     Peshwa? Be yourself the judge, and say whether such a conduct would\r\n     become a prince or not. Why, then, do you mention it? why do you\r\n     write it?\r\n\r\n     \"The case is as follows.--At first there was the utmost enmity\r\n     between Hyder Naig and the Pundit Purdhaun, and there was the\r\n     fullest intention of sending troops into Hyder Naig's country; and\r\n     after the conclusion of the war with Bombay and the capture of\r\n     Ragonaut Row, it was firmly resolved to send troops into that\r\n     quarter; and a reliance was placed in the treaty which was entered\r\n     into by the gentlemen of Bombay before the war. But when Ragonaut\r\n     again went to them, and General Goddard was ready to commence\r\n     hostilities,--when no regard was paid to the friendly proposals\r\n     made by us and the Pundit Peshwa,--when they desisted from coming\r\n     to Poonah, agreeable to their promise, and a categorical answer was\r\n     given to the deputies from Poonah,--the ministers of Poonah then\r\n     consulted among themselves, and, having advised with the Nabob\r\n     Nizam ul Dowlah, they considered that as enemies were appearing on\r\n     both sides, and it would be difficult to cope with both, what was\r\n     to be done? Peace must be made with one of them, and war must be\r\n     carried on with the other. They wished above all things, in their\r\n     hearts, to make peace with the English gentlemen, and to unite with\r\n     them to punish Hyder Naig; but these gentlemen had plainly refused\r\n     to enter into any terms of reconciliation. It was therefore\r\n     advisable to accommodate matters with Hyder Naig, although he had\r\n     been long an enemy. What else could be done? Having nothing left\r\n     for it, they were compelled to enter into an union with Hyder.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, this declaration, made to Mr. Hastings himself, was never\r\nanswered by him. Indeed, answered it could not be; because the thing was\r\nmanifest, that all the desolation of the Carnatic by Hyder Ali, all\r\nthese difficulties upon which he has insisted, the whole of that union\r\nby which he was pressed, and against which, as he says, he bore up with\r\nsuch fortitude, was his own work, the consequences of his bad faith, and\r\nhis not listening to any reasonable terms of peace.\r\n\r\nBut, my Lords, see what sort of peace he afterwards made. I could prove,\r\nif I were called upon so to do, from this paper that they have had the\r\nfolly and madness to produce to you for other purposes, that he might at\r\nany time have made a better treaty, and have concluded a more secure and\r\nadvantageous peace, than that which at last he acceded to; that the\r\ntreaty he made was both disadvantageous and dishonorable, inasmuch as we\r\ngave up every ally we had, and sacrificed them to the resentment of the\r\nenemy; that Mahdajee Sindia gained by it an empire of a magnitude\r\ndangerous to our very existence in India; that this chief was permitted\r\nto exterminate all the many little gallant nations that stood between us\r\nand the Mahrattas, and whose policy led them to guard against the\r\nambitious designs of that government. Almost all these lesser powers,\r\nfrom Central India, quite up to the mountains that divide India from\r\nTartary, almost all these, I say, were exterminated by him, or were\r\nbrought under a cruel subjection. The peace he made with Mr. Hastings\r\nwas for the very purpose of doing all this; and Mr. Hastings enabled\r\nhim, and gave him the means of effecting it.\r\n\r\nAdvert next, my Lords, to what he did with other allies. By the treaty\r\nof Poorunder, made by Colonel Upton, and which he flagitiously broke, we\r\nhad acquired, what, God knows, we little merited from the Mahrattas,\r\ntwelve lacs, (112,000_l._) for the expenses of the war,--and a country\r\nof three lacs of annual revenue, the province of Baroach and the isle of\r\nSalsette, and other small islands convenient for us upon that coast.\r\nThis was a great, useful, and momentous accession of territory and of\r\nrevenue: and we got it with honor; for not one of our allies were\r\nsacrificed by this treaty. We had even obtained from the Mahrattas for\r\nRagonaut Row, our support of whom against that government was a\r\nprincipal cause of the war, an establishment of a thousand horse, to be\r\nmaintained at their expense, and a jaghire for his other expenses of\r\nthree lacs of rupees per annum, payable monthly, with leave to reside\r\nwithin their territories, with no other condition than that he should\r\nnot remove from the place fixed for his residence for the purpose of\r\nexciting disturbances against their government. They also stipulated for\r\nthe pardon, of all his adherents except four; and the only condition\r\nthey required from us was, that we should not assist him in case of any\r\nfuture disturbance. But Mr. Hastings, by his treaty, surrendered that\r\ncountry of three lacs of revenue; he made no stipulation for the\r\nexpenses of the war, nor indemnity for any of the persons whom he had\r\nseduced into the rebellion in favor of Ragonaut Row; he gave them all up\r\nto the vengeance of their governments, without a stroke of a pen in\r\ntheir favor, to be banished, confiscated, and undone; and as to Ragonaut\r\nRow, instead of getting him this honorable and secure retreat, as he was\r\nbound to do, this unfortunate man was ordered to retire to his enemy's\r\n(Mahdajee Sindia's) country, or otherwise he was not to receive a\r\nshilling for his maintenance.\r\n\r\nI will now ask your Lordships, whether any man but Mr. Hastings would\r\nclaim a merit with his own country for having broken the treaty of\r\nPoorunder? Your Lordships know the opinion of the House of Commons\r\nrespecting it; his colleagues in Council had remonstrated with him upon\r\nit, and had stated the mischiefs that would result from it; and Sir Eyre\r\nCoote, the commander of the Company's forces, writing at the same time\r\nfrom Madras, states, that he thought it would infallibly bring down upon\r\nthem Hyder Ali, who, they had reason to think, was bent upon the utter\r\ndestruction of the power of this country in India, and was only waiting\r\nfor some crisis in our affairs favorable to his designs. This, my Lords,\r\nis to be one of the set-offs against all the crimes, against the\r\nmultiplied frauds, cruelties, and oppressions, all the corrupt\r\npractices, prevarications, and swindlings, that we have alleged against\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, it would be an endless undertaking, and such as, at this hour\r\nof the day, we, as well as your Lordships, are little fitted to engage\r\nin, if I were to attempt to search into and unveil all the secret\r\nmotives, or to expose as it deserves the shameless audacity of this\r\nman's conduct. None of your Lordships can have observed without\r\nastonishment the selection of his merits, as he audaciously calls them,\r\nwhich has been brought before you. The last of this selection, in\r\nparticular, looks as if he meant to revile and spit upon the legislature\r\nof his country, because we and you thought it fit and were resolved to\r\npublish to all India that we will not countenance offensive wars, and\r\nthat you felt this so strongly as to pass the first act of a kind that\r\nwas ever made, namely, an act to limit the discretionary power of\r\ngovernment in making war solely,--and because you have done this solely\r\nand upon no other account and for no other reason under heaven than the\r\nabuse which that man at your bar has made of it, and for which abuse he\r\nnow presumes to take merit to himself. I will read this part of the act\r\nto your Lordships.\r\n\r\n     [_Mr. Burke here read 24th Geo. III. cap. 25, sect. 34._]\r\n\r\n     \"And whereas to pursue schemes of conquest and extension of\r\n     dominion in India are measures repugnant to the wish, the honor,\r\n     and policy of this nation, be it therefore further enacted by the\r\n     authority aforesaid, that it shall not be lawful for the\r\n     Governor-General and Council of Port William aforesaid, without the\r\n     express command and authority of the said Court of Directors, or of\r\n     the Secret Committee of the said Court of Directors, in any case,\r\n     (except where hostilities have actually been commenced, or\r\n     preparations actually made for the commencement of hostilities,\r\n     against the British nation in India, or against some of the princes\r\n     or states dependent thereon, or whose territories the said United\r\n     Company shall be at such time engaged by any subsisting treaty to\r\n     defend or guaranty,) either to declare war, or commence\r\n     hostilities, or enter into any treaty for making war, against any\r\n     of the country princes or states in India, or any treaty for\r\n     guarantying the possessions of any country princes or states; and\r\n     that in such case it shall not be lawful for the said\r\n     Governor-General and Council to declare war, or commence\r\n     hostilities, or enter into treaty for making war, against any other\r\n     prince or state than such as shall be actually committing\r\n     hostilities or making preparations as aforesaid, or to make such\r\n     treaty for guarantying the possessions of any prince or state, but\r\n     upon the consideration of such prince or state actually engaging to\r\n     assist the Company against such hostilities commenced or\r\n     preparations made as aforesaid; and in all cases where hostilities\r\n     shall be commenced or treaty made, the said Governor-General and\r\n     Council shall, by the most expeditious means they can devise,\r\n     communicate the same unto the said Court of Directors, together\r\n     with a full state of the information and intelligence upon which\r\n     they shall have commenced such hostilities or made such treaties,\r\n     and their motives and reasons for the same at large.\"\r\n\r\nIt is the first act of the kind that ever was made in this kingdom, the\r\nfirst statute, I believe, that ever was made by the legislature of any\r\nnation, upon the subject; and it was made solely upon the resolutions\r\nto which we had come against the violent, intemperate, unjust, and\r\nperfidious acts of this man at your Lordships' bar, and which acts are\r\nnow produced before your Lordships as merits.\r\n\r\nTo show further to your Lordships how necessary this act was, here is a\r\npart of his own correspondence, the last thing I shall beg to read to\r\nyour Lordships, and upon which I shall make no other comment than that\r\nyou will learn from it how well British faith was kept by this man, and\r\nthat it was the violation of British faith which prevented our having\r\nthe most advantageous peace, and brought on all the calamities of war.\r\nIt is part of a letter from the minister of the Rajah of Berar, a man\r\ncalled Benaram Pundit, with whom Mr. Hastings was at the time treating\r\nfor a peace; and he tells him why he might have had peace at that time,\r\nand why he had it not,--and that the cause of it was his own ridiculous\r\nand even buffoonish perfidiousness, which exposed him to the ridicule of\r\nall the princes of India, and with him the whole British nation.\r\n\r\n     \"But afterwards reflecting that it was not advisable for me to be\r\n     in such haste before I had fully understood all the contents of the\r\n     papers, I opened them in the presence of the Maha Rajah, when all\r\n     the kharetas, letters, copies, and treaties were perused with the\r\n     greatest attention and care. First, they convinced us of your great\r\n     truth and sincerity, and that you never, from the beginning to this\r\n     time, were inclined to the present disputes and hostilities; and\r\n     next, that you have not included in the articles of the treaty any\r\n     of your wishes or inclinations; and in short, the garden of the\r\n     treaty appeared to us, in all its parts, green and flourishing:\r\n     but though the fruit of it was excellent yet they appeared\r\n     different from those of Colonel Upton's treaty, (the particulars of\r\n     which I have frequently written to you,) and, upon tasting them,\r\n     proved to be bitter and very different, when compared to the former\r\n     articles. How can any of the old and established obligations be\r\n     omitted, and new matters agreed to, when it is plain that they will\r\n     produce losses and damages? Some points which you have mentioned,\r\n     under the plea of the faith and observance of treaties, are of such\r\n     a nature that the Poonah ministers can never assent to them. In all\r\n     engagements and important transactions, in which the words _but_,\r\n     and _although_, and _besides_, and _whereas_, and _why_, and other\r\n     such words of doubt, are introduced, it gives an opening to\r\n     disputes and misunderstandings. A treaty is meant for the entire\r\n     removal of all differences, not for increase of them. My departure\r\n     to Poonah has therefore been delayed.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, consider to what ironies and insults this nation was exposed,\r\nand how necessary it was for us to originate that bill which your\r\nLordships passed into an act of Parliament, with his Majesty's assent.\r\nThe words _but_, _although_, _besides_, _whereas_, and _why_, and such\r\nlike, are introduced to give an opening, and so on. Then he desires him\r\nto send another treaty, fit for him to sign.\r\n\r\n     \"I have therefore kept the treaty with the greatest care and\r\n     caution in my possession, and, having taken a copy of it, I have\r\n     added to each article another, which appeared to me proper and\r\n     advisable, and without any loss or disadvantage to the English, or\r\n     anything more in favor of the Pundit Purdhaun than what was\r\n     contained in the former treaties. This I have sent to you, and hope\r\n     that you will prepare and send a treaty conformable to that,\r\n     without any _besides_, or _if_, or _why_, or _but_, and _whereas_,\r\n     that, as soon as it arrives, I may depart for Poonah, and, having\r\n     united with me Row Mahdajee Sindia, and having brought over the\r\n     Nabob Nizam ul Dowlah to this business, I may settle and adjust all\r\n     matters which are in this bad situation. As soon as I have received\r\n     my dismission from thence, I would set off for Calcutta, and\r\n     represent to you everything which for a long while I have had on my\r\n     mind, and by this transaction erect to the view of all the world\r\n     the standard of the greatness and goodness of the English and of my\r\n     master, and extinguish the flames of war with the waters of\r\n     friendship. The compassing all these advantages and happy prospects\r\n     depends entirely upon your will and consent; and the power of\r\n     bringing them to an issue is in your hands alone.\"\r\n\r\nMy Lords, you may here see the necessity there was for passing the act\r\nof Parliament which I have just read to you, in order to prevent in\r\nfuture the recurrence of that want of faith of which Mr. Hastings had\r\nbeen so notoriously guilty, and by which he had not only united all\r\nIndia against us, and had hindered us from making, for a long time, any\r\npeace at all, but had exposed the British character to the irony, scorn,\r\nderision, and insult of the whole people of that vast continent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy Lords, in the progress of this impeachment, you have heard our\r\ncharges; you have heard the prisoner's plea of merits; you have heard\r\nour observations on them. In the progress of this impeachment, you have\r\nseen the condition in which Mr. Hastings received Benares; you have seen\r\nthe condition in which Mr. Hastings received the country of the\r\nRohillas; you have seen the condition in which he received the country\r\nof Oude; you have seen the condition in which he received the provinces\r\nof Bengal; you have seen the condition of the country when the native\r\ngovernment was succeeded by that of Mr. Hastings; you have seen the\r\nhappiness and prosperity of all its inhabitants, from those of the\r\nhighest to those of the lowest rank. My Lords, you have seen the very\r\nreverse of all this under the government of Mr. Hastings,--the country\r\nitself, all its beauty and glory, ending in a jungle for wild beasts.\r\nYou have seen flourishing families reduced to implore that pity which\r\nthe poorest man and the meanest situation might very well call for. You\r\nhave seen whole nations in the mass reduced to a condition of the same\r\ndistress. These things in his government at home. Abroad, scorn,\r\ncontempt, and derision cast upon and covering the British name, war\r\nstirred up, and dishonorable treaties of peace made, by the total\r\nprostitution of British faith. Now take, my Lords, together, all the\r\nmultiplied delinquencies which we have proved, from the highest degree\r\nof tyranny to the lowest degree of sharping and cheating, and then\r\njudge, my Lords, whether the House of Commons could rest for one moment,\r\nwithout bringing these matters, which have baffled all legislation at\r\nvarious times, before you, to try at last what judgment will do.\r\nJudgment is what gives force, effect, and vigor to laws; laws without\r\njudgment are contemptible and ridiculous; we had better have no laws\r\nthan laws not enforced by judgments and suitable penalties upon\r\ndelinquents. Revert, my Lords, to all the sentences which have\r\nheretofore been passed by this high court; look at the sentence passed\r\nupon Lord Bacon, look at the sentence passed upon Lord Macclesfield; and\r\nthen compare the sentences which your ancestors have given with the\r\ndelinquencies which were then before them, and you have the measure to\r\nbe taken in your sentence upon the delinquent now before you. Your\r\nsentence, I say, will be measured according to that rule which ought to\r\ndirect the judgment of all courts in like cases, lessening it for a\r\nlesser offence, and aggravating it for a greater, until the measure of\r\njustice is completely full.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy Lords, I have done; the part of the Commons is concluded. With a\r\ntrembling solicitude we consign this product of our long, long labors to\r\nyour charge. Take it!--take it! It is a sacred trust. Never before was a\r\ncause of such magnitude submitted to any human tribunal.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, at this awful close, in the name of the Commons, and\r\nsurrounded by them, I attest the retiring, I attest the advancing\r\ngenerations, between which, as a link in the great chain of eternal\r\norder, we stand. We call this nation, we call the world to witness, that\r\nthe Commons have shrunk from no labor, that we have been guilty of no\r\nprevarication, that we have made no compromise with crime, that we have\r\nnot feared any odium whatsoever, in the long warfare which we have\r\ncarried on with the crimes, with the vices, with the exorbitant wealth,\r\nwith the enormous and overpowering influence of Eastern corruption. This\r\nwar, my Lords, we have waged for twenty-two years, and the conflict has\r\nbeen fought at your Lordships' bar for the last seven years. My Lords,\r\ntwenty-two years is a great space in the scale of the life of man; it is\r\nno inconsiderable space in the history of a great nation. A business\r\nwhich has so long occupied the councils and the tribunals of Great\r\nBritain cannot possibly be huddled over in the course of vulgar, trite,\r\nand transitory events. Nothing but some of those great revolutions that\r\nbreak the traditionary chain of human memory, and alter the very face of\r\nNature itself, can possibly obscure it. My Lords, we are all elevated to\r\na degree of importance by it; the meanest of us will, by means of it,\r\nmore or less become the concern of posterity,--if we are yet to hope for\r\nsuch a thing, in the present state of the world, as a recording,\r\nretrospective, civilized posterity: but this is in the hands of the\r\ngreat Disposer of events; it is not ours to settle how it shall be.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, your House yet stands,--it stands as a great edifice; but let\r\nme say, that it stands in the midst of ruins,--in the midst of the ruins\r\nthat have been made by the greatest moral earthquake that ever convulsed\r\nand shattered this globe of ours. My Lords, it has pleased Providence to\r\nplace us in such a state that we appear every moment to be upon the\r\nverge of some great mutations. There is one thing, and one thing only,\r\nwhich defies all mutation,--that which existed before the world, and\r\nwill survive the fabric of the world itself: I mean justice,--that\r\njustice which, emanating from the Divinity, has a place in the breast of\r\nevery one of us, given us for our guide with regard to ourselves and\r\nwith regard to others, and which will stand, after this globe is burned\r\nto ashes, our advocate or our accuser before the great Judge, when He\r\ncomes to call upon us for the tenor of a well-spent life.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, the Commons will share in every fate with your Lordships;\r\nthere is nothing sinister which can happen to you, in which we shall not\r\nbe involved: and if it should so happen that we shall be subjected to\r\nsome of those frightful changes which we have seen,--if it should happen\r\nthat your Lordships, stripped of all the decorous distinctions of human\r\nsociety, should, by hands at once base and cruel, be led to those\r\nscaffolds and machines of murder upon which great kings and glorious\r\nqueens have shed their blood, amidst the prelates, amidst the nobles,\r\namidst the magistrates who supported their thrones, may you in those\r\nmoments feel that consolation which I am persuaded they felt in the\r\ncritical moments of their dreadful agony!\r\n\r\nMy Lords, there is a consolation, and a great consolation it is, which\r\noften happens to oppressed virtue and fallen dignity. It often happens\r\nthat the very oppressors and persecutors themselves are forced to bear\r\ntestimony in its favor. I do not like to go for instances a great way\r\nback into antiquity. I know very well that length of time operates so as\r\nto give an air of the fabulous to remote events, which lessens the\r\ninterest and weakens the application of examples. I wish to come nearer\r\nto the present time. Your Lordships know and have heard (for which of us\r\nhas not known and heard?) of the Parliament of Paris. The Parliament of\r\nParis had an origin very, very similar to that of the great court before\r\nwhich I stand; the Parliament of Paris continued to have a great\r\nresemblance to it in its constitution, even to its fall: the Parliament\r\nof Paris, my Lords, WAS; it is gone! It has passed away; it has\r\nvanished like a dream! It fell, pierced by the sword of the Comte de\r\nMirabeau. And yet I will say, that that man, at the time of his\r\ninflicting the death-wound of that Parliament, produced at once the\r\nshortest and the grandest funeral oration that ever was or could be made\r\nupon the departure of a great court of magistracy. Though he had himself\r\nsmarted under its lash, as every one knows who knows his history, (and\r\nhe was elevated to dreadful notoriety in history,) yet, when he\r\npronounced the death sentence upon that Parliament, and inflicted the\r\nmortal wound, he declared that his motives for doing it were merely\r\npolitical, and that their hands were as pure as those of justice itself,\r\nwhich they administered. A great and glorious exit, my Lords, of a great\r\nand glorious body! And never was a eulogy pronounced upon a body more\r\ndeserved. They were persons, in nobility of rank, in amplitude of\r\nfortune, in weight of authority, in depth of learning, inferior to few\r\nof those that hear me. My Lords, it was but the other day that they\r\nsubmitted their necks to the axe; but their honor was unwounded. Their\r\nenemies, the persons who sentenced them to death, were lawyers full of\r\nsubtlety, they were enemies full of malice; yet lawyers full of\r\nsubtlety, and enemies full of malice, as they were, they did not dare to\r\nreproach them with having supported the wealthy, the great, and\r\npowerful, and of having oppressed the weak and feeble, in any of their\r\njudgments, or of having perverted justice, in any one instance whatever,\r\nthrough favor, through interest, or cabal.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, if you must fall, may you so fall! But if you stand,--and\r\nstand I trust you will, together with the fortune of this ancient\r\nmonarchy, together with the ancient laws and liberties of this great and\r\nillustrious kingdom,--may you stand as unimpeached in honor as in power!\r\nMay you stand, not as a substitute for virtue, but as an ornament of\r\nvirtue, as a security for virtue! May you stand long, and long stand the\r\nterror of tyrants! May you stand the refuge of afflicted nations!
