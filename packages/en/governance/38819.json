It is the\r\nfashion to be interested in English notables. But that sort of thing\r\nwon't do here. The American public gets in the newspapers all it wants\r\nabout our national politicians. That isn't book material.\"\r\n\r\nAn editor said that just a year ago when we told him of the plan for the\r\n_Mirrors of Washington_. And, frankly, it seemed doubtful whether\r\nreaders generally cared enough about our national political\r\npersonalities to buy a book exclusively concerned with them.\r\n\r\nBut they did. The _Mirrors of Washington_ became an instantaneous\r\nsuccess. It commanded almost unprecedented attention. It was heartily\r\ndamned and vociferously welcomed. By the averagely curious citizen,\r\neager for insight behind the gilded curtains of press-agentry and\r\npartisanship, it was hailed as a shaft of common-sense sunlight thrown\r\ninto a clay-footed wilderness of political pap. And close to one hundred\r\nthousand copies were absorbed by a public evidently genuinely interested\r\nin an uncensored analysis of the people who are running us, or ruining\r\nus, as individual viewpoint may determine.\r\n\r\nThe _Mirrors of Washington_ was by way of being a pioneer, at least for\r\nAmerica. Overseas, it is habitual enough to exhibit beneath the literary\r\nmicroscope the politically great and near-great, and even to dissect\r\nthem--often enough without anaesthesia. To our mind, such critical\r\nexamination is healthily desirable. Here in America, we are\r\ncase-hardened to the newspapers, whose appraisal of political personages\r\nis, after all, pretty well confined to the periods of pre-election\r\ncampaigning. And we are precious little influenced by this sort of\r\nthing; the pro papers are so pro, and the anti papers so anti, that few\r\ntry to determine how much to believe and how much to dismiss as routine\r\npartisan prevarication.\r\n\r\nBut a book! Political criticism, and personality analyses, frozen into\r\nthe so-permanently-appearing dignity of a printed volume--that is\r\nsomething else again! Even a politician who dismisses with a smile or a\r\nshrug recurrent discompliments in the news columns or the anonymous\r\neditorial pages of the press, is tempted to burst into angry protest\r\nwhen far less bitter, far more balanced criticism of himself is voiced\r\nin a book. A phenomenon, that, doubtless revisable as time goes on and\r\nthe reflections of more book-bound Mirrors brighten the eyes of those\r\nwho read and jangle the nerves of those who run--for office.\r\n\r\n_Behind the Mirrors_ is another such book. It delves into the\r\nfundamentals at Washington. It is concerned with political tendencies as\r\nwell as political personalities. It presents what impresses us as a\r\ngenuinely useful and brilliant picture of present-day governmental\r\npsychology and functioning. It is a cross section of things as they are.\r\n\r\nThe picture behind the mirrors is not as pretty as it might be. Probably\r\nthe way to make it prettier is to let ample light in upon it so that the\r\nblemishes, discerned, may be rectified; and to impress those responsible\r\nfor its rehabilitation with the necessity of taking advantage of the\r\nopportunities that are theirs.\r\n\r\nWhen President Eliot of Harvard presented to a certain Senator an\r\nhonorary degree, he described with inimitable charm and considerable\r\ndetail that Senator's literary achievements; and then he mentioned his\r\npolitical activities, ending with substantially these words: \"A man with\r\ngreat opportunities for public service still inviting him.\"\r\n\r\nThe invitation yet holds good. Acceptances are still in order.\r\n\r\n                                                   G. P.

GOD'S TIME AS IT WAS IN THE AMERICAN\r\nPOLITICAL CONSCIOUSNESS\r\n\r\n\r\nPresident Harding had recently to decide the momentous question whether\r\nwe should have daylight saving in Washington. He decided it in a\r\nperfectly characteristic way, perfectly characteristic of himself and of\r\nour present political division and unsureness. He ruled that the city\r\nshould go to work and quit work an hour earlier, but that it should not\r\nturn back the hands of the clock, should not lay an impious finger upon\r\nGod's Time.\r\n\r\nThat this straddle is typical of our President needs no argument--he\r\n\"has to be so careful,\" as he once pathetically said--but that it is\r\nsymptomatic of the present American political consciousness perhaps\r\nneeds elucidation.\r\n\r\nThe clock is one of the problems left to us by the Great War, one of\r\nthe innumerable problems thus left to us; it involves our whole attitude\r\ntoward men and things.\r\n\r\nIt represents, rather literally, Mechanism. In the war we adopted\r\nperforce the creed that man was sufficiently master of his own destiny\r\nto adapt Mechanism to his own ends; he could lay a presumptuous hand\r\nupon God's Time. But in peace shall he go on thus boldly? Or shall he\r\nrevert to the good old days, the days of McKinley, when the clock was\r\nsacred? Think of all the happiness, all the prosperity, that was ours,\r\nall the duty done and all the destiny abundantly realized, before man\r\nthought to lay a hand upon the clock!\r\n\r\nThe question what the limits to human government are is involved. What\r\nmay man attempt for himself and what should he leave to the great\r\nMechanism which has, upon the whole, run the world so well, to the Sun\r\nin its courses, to progress, to inevitability? After all the clock was\r\nin the beginning, is now and ever shall be--unless we meddle with\r\nit--and before its cheerful face America was built from a wilderness\r\ninto a vast nation, creating wealth, so as to be the third historic\r\nwonder of the ages--the glory that was Greece, the grandeur that was\r\nRome, the dollars that are America.\r\n\r\nAnd not only are we divided as to the limits of government, but where\r\nshall Mr. Harding look for authority to guide him with respect to\r\nclocks? To his party? This is a party government, you remember. But his\r\nparty speaks with no clear voice about clocks or about anything else. To\r\nbusiness? Business has only one rule--more clocks in government and less\r\ngovernment in clocks. But business bows to the public. To public opinion\r\nthen? The public is divided about clocks; we tend to grow class\r\nconscious about clocks. And clamorously amid all these authorities is\r\nheard the voice of the Farm Bloc exclaiming: \"Don't touch God's Time.\"\r\n\r\nSo it is decided that Washington may save daylight and save the clock\r\ntoo, a double saving, a most happy compromise. If all questions touching\r\nMechanism could only be solved in the direction of such splendid\r\neconomies!\r\n\r\nI listened a year ago to a most unusual Fourth of July oration. The\r\nspeaker, like most of us in this period of breakup following the Great\r\nWar, was rather bewildered. He had, moreover, his private reasons for\r\nfeeling that life was not easily construed. An illness, perhaps mortal,\r\nafflicted him. Existence had been unclouded until this last cloud came;\r\nwhy was it to end suddenly and without reason? He had gone through the\r\nGreat War a follower of Mr. Wilson's, to see the world scoffing at the\r\npassionate faith it had professed a few months before and sneering at\r\nthe leaders it had then exalted. He had echoing in his mind the fine war\r\nphrases, \"Brotherhood of Man,\" \"War to End War,\" \"We must be just even\r\nto those to whom we do not wish to be just.\" Then some monstrous hand\r\nhad turned the page and there was Harding, just as in his own life all\r\nsuccess at the bar and in politics, and the joy of being lord of a vast\r\ncountry estate that had been patented in his family since colonial\r\ntimes, had suddenly come to an end; the page had turned.\r\n\r\nSo this is what he said, in a voice that rose not much above a whisper,\r\n\"I have told them where to dig a hole and put me, out here on my\r\npleasant place. I don't know what it means. I don't believe it has any\r\nmeaning. The only thing to do is to laugh. You have trouble laughing?\r\nLook about you and you will find plenty to laugh at. Look at your\r\nPresident and laugh. Look at your Supreme Court and laugh. Not one of\r\nthem knows whether he is coming or going. Everything for the moment has\r\nlost its meaning for everyone. If you can't laugh at anything else, just\r\nthink how many angels there are who are blank blanks and how many blank\r\nblanks there are who are angels ... and laugh.\"\r\n\r\nThe Comic Spirit looking down from some cool distance sees something\r\nlike what this lawyer saw. It sees President Harding and the Ku Klux\r\nKlan. The connection between President Harding and the Ku Klux Klan? The\r\nComic Spirit, perceiving everything, perceives that too. For it Mr.\r\nHarding is but the pious manifestation of a sentiment of which the Ku\r\nKlux Klan is the unconscious and serviceable parody, that instinctive\r\nrush of a people with the world breaking up about it, to seek safety in\r\nthe past. Men always shrink thus backward when facing an uncertain\r\nfuture, just as in moments of great peril they become children again,\r\ncall \"Mother!\" and revert to early practices at her knee. It is one of\r\nthe most intelligent things the human race ever does. It is looking\r\nbefore you leap: the race has no choice but to leap; it draws back to\r\nsolid ground in the past for a better take-off into the future. Mr.\r\nHarding represents solid ground, McKinley and the blessed nineties, the\r\ndays before men raised a presumptuous hand against the clock.\r\n\r\nIf utterly in earnest and determined to revive that happy period, you\r\nclothe yourself in that garment which evokes the assured past, the\r\nblessed nineties, the long white night shirt; the long white night shirt\r\nsupplemented by the black mask and the tar brush shall surely save you.\r\n\r\nThe Comic Spirit looking about largely, like our Fourth of July orator,\r\nsees in Mr. Harding a wise shrinking into the safety of the past and in\r\nMr. William H. Taft, our new Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, at once\r\na regard for the past and an eye for the future. Can anyone tell whether\r\nMr. Justice Taft is coming or going, as this Fourth of July speaker\r\nasked? He comes and he goes, and like the wind man knows not whence he\r\ncometh or whither he goeth. He is forward looking--when he is not\r\nbackward looking. Like Zekle,\r\n\r\n    \"He stands a while on one foot fust,\r\n      Then stands a while on t'other;\r\n    And on which one he feels the wust,\r\n      He can not tell you nuther.\"\r\n\r\nGlance at his public career. He stood upon his future foot with\r\nRoosevelt, the chosen executor of \"My Policies.\" A little later he\r\nstands upon his past foot, alongside of Aldrich and Cannon, doing the\r\nworks of perdition and bringing on the battle of Armageddon. Again you\r\nfind him standing on his future foot beside Mr. Frank P. Walsh in the\r\nWar Labor Board, ranging himself with Mr. Walsh in practically all the\r\nclose decisions. Again you see him when all the fine forward looking of\r\nthe war was over, scurrying from the Russian revolution as fast as\r\nPresident Wilson or all the rest of us. And once more on his future foot\r\nwith Mr. Wilson for the League of Nations and on his past foot with\r\nPresident Harding against the League of Nations.\r\n\r\nLet us be Freudian and say that the unconscious political self of the\r\nwhole nation is responsible for the selection of Mr. Harding and Mr.\r\nTaft. As we shrink back into the past we are aware that it is for the\r\ntake-off into the future, and so we have Mr. Taft. We both eat our cake\r\nand have it in the new Chief Justice.\r\n\r\nThe United States, like Zekle, is \"standing a while on one foot fust,\r\nthen standing a while on t'other,\" moving forward or backward. But not\r\nfor long, too large and secure to be permanently cautious, with too much\r\nwell-being to be permanently bold, thinking, but with a certain\r\nrestraining contempt for thought, instinctive rather than intellectual.\r\nVast, eupeptic, assimilative, generous, adaptable, the Chief Justice\r\ntypifies the American people in its more permanent characteristics.\r\n\r\nMr. Harding as President, Mr. Taft as Chief Justice, the agricultural\r\nbloc, the enfeebled Congress, the one million or so Democratic majority\r\nwhich becomes in four years a seven-million Republican majority, are\r\nonly manifestations. The reality is the man, many millions strong, whose\r\nmental state produces the symptoms at Washington. It will be profitable\r\nto examine the content of his mind as it was in those days before\r\nmomentous decisions had to be made about daylight saving, and as it is\r\ntoday when he hesitates between saving daylight and saving the clock,\r\nand perhaps decides to save both.\r\n\r\nI can not better describe his political consciousness as it was than by\r\nsaying that it contained three governments--the government of the clock,\r\nthe government of the clock-winders, and the government of those who\r\nlived by the clock as religiously minded by the clock-winders. It was an\r\norderly age, beautifully sure of itself, and the area of these three\r\ngovernments was nicely delimited. There was only a small place for the\r\nthird of these governments.\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of more common understanding I shall sometimes refer to\r\nthe government of the clock as the government of Progress, and the\r\ngovernment of the clock-winders as the government of business, and to\r\nthe third government as the government at Washington.\r\n\r\nBefore the war the American was sure that with each tick of the clock\r\nthe world grew richer and better, especially richer. Progress went\r\ninevitably on and on. It never turned backward or rested. Its mechanical\r\nprocess relieved man of many responsibilities. No one would think of\r\ntouching the mechanism; turning back the hands of the clock might rob us\r\nof some boon that was intended in the beginning whose moment of arrival\r\nmight be lost by interfering with God's Time.\r\n\r\nBorn on a continent which only a few years before was a wilderness but\r\nwhich now was the richest and one of the finest civilizations on the\r\nearth, the American could not fail to believe in progress. The visible\r\nevidences of it were on every hand. His father had been a poor immigrant\r\nseeking the mere chance to live; he was a farmer possessed of many\r\nacres, a business man who had an increasing income already in five\r\nfigures, a rising young attorney, or physician. Even from generation to\r\ngeneration everything got better.\r\n\r\nThe past had had its unhappy moments. The American looked back at the\r\npast mainly to measure how far he had come and to guess how far moving\r\nforward at a geometrical ratio of increased speed he would go in the not\r\ndistant future. History flattered him.\r\n\r\nBefore his eyes went on the steady conquest over Nature, or perhaps it\r\nis better to say, the steady surrender of Nature. Always there were new\r\ndiscoveries of science. Always there were new inventions. Forces which a\r\nlittle while ago were beyond control, whose existence even was\r\nunsuspected, were harnessed to everyday uses. He saw progress in\r\nstatistics. Things which were reckoned in millions began to be reckoned\r\nin hundreds of millions, began to be reckoned in billions. We loved to\r\nread the long figures where, in the pleasing extension of ciphers,\r\nwealth grew, debts grew--even debts were a source of pride before they\r\ncalled for income taxes to meet the annual payments upon them.\r\n\r\nProgress would never stop. Tomorrow we should set the sun's rays to some\r\nmore practical use than making the earth green and pleasant to look at\r\nand its fruits good to eat. We should employ them like the waters of\r\nNiagara Falls, to turn the wheels of machinery by day and to light soap\r\nand automobile signs on Broadway by night. We should split atoms apart\r\nand release the mighty forces that had held them together since the\r\nbeginning, for the production of commodities in greater and greater\r\nquantities at less and less cost.\r\n\r\n\"We should,\" I say, but I do our inmost thought a vast injustice.\r\nRather, Progress would, scientists and inventors being only the\r\ninstruments of a Fate which went steadily forward to the accomplishment\r\nof its beneficent purposes. At the right moment, at the appointed hour,\r\nthe man would appear. Progress kept the prompter's book and gave him the\r\ncue.\r\n\r\nTo a people with all these evidences of an irresistible forward movement\r\nin Nature before its eyes, came a prophet who gave it its law, the law\r\nof evolution, the law by which once the monocellular organism had\r\nacquired the mysterious gift of life out of combination and\r\nrecombination inevitably came man. It was all the unfolding of the\r\ninevitable, the unrolling of time; the working out of a law.\r\n\r\nNow, law has a quite extraordinary effect upon men's minds. The more Law\r\nthere is the less Man there is. The more man spells Law with a capital\r\nletter the more he spells himself with a small letter. Man was no longer\r\nthe special creation of God. God, instead of making Adam and Eve his\r\nwife, fashioned a grain of star dust and gave it a grain of star dust to\r\nwife, leaving the rest to Progress. Man who had been a little lower than\r\nthe angels became, by an immense act of faith, a little higher than the\r\nearthworm. The old doctrine of the Fall of Man took on a reverse twist.\r\nMan had not fallen but he had risen from such debased beginnings that he\r\nhad not got far. He was in about the same place where he would have been\r\nif he had fallen.\r\n\r\nIt was easy to turn upside down our belief in the Fall of Man. We always\r\nknew there was something wrong with him, but we did not know what it was\r\nuntil evolution explained his unregenerate character so satisfactorily.\r\nStill the thought that Man did not move forward as fast as things, was\r\nless the special ward of Progress than automobiles, elevators and\r\nbathtubs, was vaguely disturbing.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks had left us records which showed that the human mind was as\r\ngood three thousand years ago as it is today, or better. We shut our\r\neyes to this bit of evidence by abandoning the study of the classics and\r\nexcluding all allusion to them in the oratory of our Congress. And\r\nMr. Wells in his History has since justified us by proving that\r\nthe Greeks were after all only the common run of small-town\r\nfolk--over-press-agented, perhaps, by some fellows in the Middle Ages\r\nwho had got tired of the Church and who therefore pretended that there\r\nwas something bigger and better in the world than it was.\r\n\r\nSo we pinned our hopes on the Martians and spent our time frantically\r\nsignalling to the nearby planet, asking whether, when the earth grew as\r\ncold as King David when his physicians \"prescribed by way of poultice a\r\nyoung belle,\" and responded only weakly to the caress of the Sun, when\r\nits oceans dried up and only a trickle of water came down through its\r\nvalleys from the melting ice at its poles, we should not, like the\r\nfancied inhabitants of the nearest celestial body, have evolved at last\r\ninto super-beings. We wanted some evidence from our neighbors that, in\r\nspite of the Greeks, by merely watching the clock we should arrive at a\r\nhigher estate.\r\n\r\nThe point I am trying to make is that we have been conducting the most\r\ninteresting of Time's experiments in the government of men at a period\r\nwhen Man has been at a greater discount than usual in his own mind, when\r\nself-government faced too much competition from government by the clock.\r\n\r\nWhen I speak of government by the clock, I should, perhaps, use capital\r\nletters to indicate that I have in mind that timepiece on which is\r\nrecorded God's Time; whose ticking is the forward march of progress.\r\nClocks as they touch our lives require human intervention. The winders\r\nof these clocks perform something that may be described as an office.\r\n\r\nYou recall the place the clock filled in our households a generation\r\nago. Father wound it once a week, at a stated time, as regularly as he\r\nwent to church. The winding of it was a function. No other hand but\r\nfather's touched the key; if one had, the whole institution of family\r\nlife would have been imperiled. Father is a symbol for the government of\r\nthe clock-winders, those sacred persons who translated Progress into\r\nterms of common utility.\r\n\r\nWhen we descended from the regions of theocratic power to those of human\r\ninstitutions, we found ourselves in America to be workers in one vast\r\ncountrywide workshop. The workshop touches us more directly and more\r\nimportantly than does the nation. Out of the workshop comes our bread\r\nand butter. When the workshop closes down we suffer and form on line at\r\nthe soup kitchens.\r\n\r\nThree meals a day concern us more than do post-offices and federal\r\nbuildings, of however white marble or however noble facades. What we\r\nhave to eat and to wear, what we may put in the bank, what real freedom\r\nwe enjoy, our position in the eyes of men, our happiness and\r\nunhappiness, depend on our relations to the national workshop, not on\r\nour relations to the national government.\r\n\r\nWe conceived of it vaguely as a thing which produced prosperity, not\r\nprosperity in its larger and more permanent aspects--that was ours\r\nthrough the beneficence of Progress and the immortal luck of our\r\ncountry--but prosperity in its more immediate details.\r\n\r\nA lot of confused thinking in which survived political ideas as old as\r\nthe race, converted into modern forms, entered into our conception of\r\nit. It was a thing of gods and demigods, with legends of golden fleeces\r\nand of Hercules holding up the skies. It was feudal in its privileges\r\nand immunities. It enjoyed the divine right of kings. Yet it operated\r\nunder laws not made by man.\r\n\r\nWhen it failed to effect prosperity, it was because of a certain law\r\nthat at the end of ever so many years of fatness it must produce a\r\nfamine. At such times men, demigods, stepped out of banks with sacks of\r\ngold on their shoulders and mitigated the rigors of its failure.\r\n\r\nAnd these splendid personages might set going again that which law\r\nstopped. We bowed patiently and unquestioningly to its periodic\r\neccentricity as part of the Fate that fell upon the original sinner, and\r\nwatched hopefully the powerful men who might in their pleasure or their\r\nwisdom end our sufferings.\r\n\r\nWe were taught to regard it as a thing distinct from political\r\nauthority, so that the less governors and lawmakers interfered with it\r\nthe better for the general welfare. Back in our past is a thorough\r\ncontempt for human intelligence which relates somehow to the religious\r\nprecept against questioning the wisdom of God. Whatever ordinary men did\r\nin the field of economics was sure to be wrong and to check the flow of\r\ngoods upon which the well-being of society depended. We were all, except\r\nthe familiars of the great forces, impotent pieces of the game economic\r\nlaw played upon this checker-board of nights and days.\r\n\r\nI have said that this government of the national workshop in which we\r\nwere all laborers or foremen or superintendents or masters sometimes\r\nseemed to our consciousness a government of laws and sometimes a\r\ngovernment of men. In any primitive faith priests played a large part,\r\nand probably the primitive worshippers before them much of the time did\r\nnot think beyond the priests, while sometimes they did--when it was\r\nconvenient for the priests that they should.\r\n\r\nWhen famines or plagues came it was because the gods were angry. When\r\nthey are averted it is the priests who have averted them. When economic\r\npanics came it was because we had sinned against economic law; when they\r\nwere averted it was because men had averted them, men who lived on\r\nintimate terms with economic law and understood its mysterious ways, and\r\nenjoyed its favor, as their great possessions testified.\r\n\r\nNaturally, we are immensely more directly and more constantly concerned\r\nwith this government than with the government at Washington. Besides, we\r\nwere mostly business men, or hoped to be. It was our government more\r\ntruly than was the government at Washington.\r\n\r\nOnly a limited area in the political consciousness was left for\r\nself-government. You descended from the heights to the broad flat plain\r\nof man's contempt for man. It was there, rooted firmly in the\r\nconstitution, that the government at Washington reared its head.\r\nSelf-government is a new thing; no myth has gathered about it. It was\r\nestablished among men who believed in the doctrine of the original sin,\r\nand it had been carried by their successors, who had abandoned the\r\nsinner Adam as the progenitor of their kind for the sinless but\r\ninglorious earthworm. The inferiority complex which is the race's most\r\npersistent heritage from the past was written all over it.\r\n\r\nI suppose it was Adam Smith who made self-government possible by\r\ndiscovering that the things really essential to our welfare would take\r\ncare of themselves if we only let them alone and that the more we let\r\nthem alone the better they would take care of themselves, under eternal\r\nand immutable laws. Ah, the happy thought occurred, if the really\r\nessential things are thus beneficially regulated why shouldn't we have\r\nthe fun of managing the non-essentials ourselves?\r\n\r\nProgress ruled the world kindly and well. It might be trusted to see\r\nthat all went for the best. The government of business functioned\r\neffectively for the general weal. The future was in the hands of a force\r\nthat made the world richer and better. The present, in all that\r\nconcerned man most vitally with regards food and shelter, was directed\r\nby enlightened self-interest represented by men who personified success.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible not to be optimistic when existence was so well\r\nordered. There was no sorry scheme of things to be seized entire. Life\r\nwas a sort of tropics without tropical discomforts. The tropics do not\r\nproduce men. They produce things.\r\n\r\nThe Mechanism worked, as it seemed to us, in those happy days. We were\r\nsatisfied with the clock and the clock-winders. We were not divided in\r\nour minds as to whether we should turn back its hands. The less men\r\nmeddled the better. There was little work for human government to do.\r\nThere was no call for men.\r\n\r\nThe picture in our heads, to use Mr. Graham Wallas's phrase, was of a\r\nworld well ruled by a will from the beginning, whose purpose was\r\nincrease; of some superior men having semi-sacred relations with the\r\nwill who acted as intermediaries between the will and the rest of us;\r\nand of the rest of us as being rewarded by the will, through its\r\nintermediaries, according to our timidity and submissiveness.\r\n\r\nIt was, the world, over the great age of the racial inferiority complex,\r\nfor which Science had furnished a new and convincing basis. I might\r\nmaintain that the Great War was modern society's effort to compensate\r\nfor the evolution complex; man wanted to show what he could do, in spite\r\nof his slimy origin. Anyway, it broke the picture in our heads. Being\r\neconomical, like Mr. Harding, we are trying both to save the pieces of\r\nthe picture and put them together again, and to form, out of them\r\nunfortunately, a new picture; which accounts for our confusion.\r\n\r\nBut the picture in our heads before the war, such as it was, is the\r\nreason for our present inadequacy. You could not form much of a\r\nself-government or develop men for one, with that complex in your soul.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nGOD'S TIME AS IT IS; AN INGERSOLL THAT REQUIRES MUCH WINDING\r\n\r\n\r\nHow many of us believe in Progress with the unquestioning faith we had\r\nbefore that day in July, 1914, when Austria's declaration of war upon\r\nSerbia started the ruin of all that centuries had built up in Europe?\r\nMost of us have not stopped to analyze what has happened since to our\r\nbelief that the world ever moved by an irresistible primal impulse\r\nforward to more and better things, that the song which the morning stars\r\nsang together was \"It shall be multiplied unto you,\" that increment is\r\ninevitable and blessed. But how many of us really believe that in the\r\nunqualified way we once did?\r\n\r\nThe world had many pleasant illusions about Progress before the great\r\ncatastrophe of 1914 came to shatter them. And nowhere were these\r\nillusions more cheerfully accepted than in this country of ours, where a\r\nwilderness had become a great civilization in the space of a century and\r\nwhere the evidences of rapid, continuous advancement were naturally\r\nstrong.\r\n\r\nThe first pleasant illusion was that modern progress had made war\r\nimpossible, at least war between the great nations of the earth, which,\r\nprofiting by the examples we had set them, enjoyed more or less free\r\ngovernments, where production mounted from year to year, where wealth\r\nwas ever increasing. Destiny plainly meant more and more iron dug from\r\nthe ground and turned into steel machinery, larger, more powerful\r\nautomobiles, taller and taller buildings, swifter and swifter elevators,\r\nmore and more capacious freight cars, and destiny would not tolerate\r\nstopping all this for the insanity of destruction.\r\n\r\nMoreover--how good were the ways of Progress--the ever increasing\r\nmastery over the forces of nature which had been fate's latest and best\r\ngift to humanity, approaching a sort of millennium of machinery, while\r\ncreating vaster engines of industry had brought into being more and\r\nmonstrous weapons of warfare.\r\n\r\nLife with benignant irony was making man peaceful in spite of himself.\r\nHis bigger and bigger cannon, his more and more lethal explosives were\r\ndestroying his capacity for destruction. War was being hoist by its own\r\npetard. The bigger the armies, the more annihilating the shells piled up\r\nin the arsenals, the less the chance of their ever being used.\r\n\r\nProgress, infinitely good toward man, had found a way out of war, the\r\nplague that had blighted the earth since the beginning. What religion\r\ncould not do, the steel foundries and the chemical laboratories had\r\ndone. They had made war too deadly to be endured. In effect they had\r\nabolished it. Peace was a by-product of the Bessemer oven and the dye\r\nvat. Man's conquest of himself was an unconsidered incident of his\r\nconquest of nature.\r\n\r\nThen there were the costs of war. Progress had done something more than\r\nmake fighting intolerably destructive of men and cities; it had made it\r\nintolerably destructive of money. Even if we would go to war, we could\r\nnot since no nation could face the vast expenditures.\r\n\r\nTwo little wars of brief duration, the Boer War and the Balkan War, had\r\nleft great debts to be paid and had brought in their train financial\r\ndisturbances affecting the entire world. A European war would destroy\r\nimmensely more capital and involve vastly greater burdens. No nation\r\nwith such a load on its shoulders could meet the competition of its\r\npeace keeping rivals for the world's trade. No government in its senses\r\nwould provoke such consequences, and governments were, of course, always\r\nin their senses.\r\n\r\nYou did not have to accept this as an act of faith; you could prove it.\r\nShells, thanks to Progress, cost so many hundreds of dollars each.\r\nCannon to fire them cost so many thousands of dollars each and could\r\nonly be used a very few times. Armies such as the nations of Europe\r\ntrained, cost so much a day to feed and to move. The demonstration was\r\nperfect. Progress had rendered war virtually impossible.\r\n\r\nIf in spite of all a war between great modern nations did start, it\r\ncould last only a few weeks. No people could stand the strain.\r\nBankruptcy lay at the end of a short campaign. A month would disclose\r\nthe folly of it, and bring the contestants to their senses; if it did\r\nnot, exhaustion would. Credit would quickly disappear. Nations could not\r\nborrow on the scale necessary to prolong the struggle.\r\n\r\nThe wisest said all these things as governments began to issue orders of\r\nmobilization in 1914. Emperors were merely shaking their shining armor\r\nat each other. There would be no war. It was impossible. The world had\r\nprogressed too far. Anachronistic monarchies might not know it, but it\r\nhad. Their armies belonged as much to the past as their little titles,\r\nas all the middle-age humbug of royalty, their high-wheeled coaches,\r\ntheir out-riders in their bright uniform, their debilitating habit of\r\nmarrying cousins, their absurdities about their own divine rights. They\r\nhad armies, as they wore upturned mustachios, to make themselves look\r\nimposing. They were as unreal as the pictured kings in children's story\r\nbooks or on a deck of cards. Forces mightier than they had settled\r\nforever the question of war.\r\n\r\nAnd when hostilities actually began an incredulous America knew they\r\nwould be over in three months. Anybody with a piece of paper and a\r\npencil could prove that they could not last. It took all of Kitchener's\r\nprestige to persuade society that the fighting would keep on through the\r\nwinter, and his prediction that it would continue three years was\r\nreceived as the error of a reporter or the opinion of a professional\r\nsoldier who overlooked the economic impossibility of a long war.\r\n\r\nIt is worth while recalling these cheerful illusions to estimate what\r\nhas happened to the idea of Progress in seven swiftly changing years. We\r\ndid not give up readily the illusion that the world had been vastly and\r\npermanently changed for the better. As it was proved that there could be\r\na war and a long one and as the evidence multiplied that this war was\r\nthe most devastating in all history, we merely changed our idea of\r\nProgress, which became in our minds a force that sometimes produced evil\r\nin order that good might result.\r\n\r\nThe Great War itself was assimilated to our idea of a beneficent fate.\r\nWhom Progress loveth it chasteneth. Instead of rendering war impossible\r\nby making it destructive and costly, it visited the earth with the\r\ngreatest war of all time in order to make war impossible. This was the\r\nwar to end all war. The ways of progress were past finding out but they\r\nwere good.\r\n\r\nPaper demonstrations had gone wrong. Governments did not go bankrupt\r\nafter a few months but could still borrow at the end of five years.\r\nHumanity did not sicken and turn away from the destruction, but the\r\ngreater the carnage the more eager were the nations still at peace to\r\nhave a hand in it. Still it could never happen again. It was a lesson\r\nsent of fate. Men must co-operate with progress and not leave to that\r\nforce the sole responsibility for a permanently peaceful future. They\r\nhad sinned against the light in allowing such unprogressive things, as\r\nautocracies upon the earth. They must remove the abominations of the\r\nHapsburgs and the Hohenzollerns. Once they had set up that brightest\r\nflower of Progress, modern democracy, in place of the ancient empires,\r\nthere would be no more wars. Democracy had one great merit. It was\r\nrather stupid and lacking in foresight. It did not prepare for war and\r\nbeing forever unready would not fight.\r\n\r\nThe war had been sent by Progress to call man's attention to their\r\nduties regarding certain anachronisms with which Progress was otherwise\r\nunable to deal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: UNCLE SAM'S CONFERENCE]\r\n\r\nYou will observe that the idea of Progress took three forms in as many\r\nyears. First it was a pure force moving straight ahead toward a goal of\r\nunimaginable splendor, even whose questionable products like bigger\r\ncannon and higher explosives accomplished by one of its larger ironies\r\nbenefits that were the opposite of their purposes.\r\n\r\nThen assuming the aspects of a more personal deity, it became capable of\r\nintentions and could choose courses utterly inconsistent with itself in\r\norder to achieve ends that would be splendidly consistent with itself.\r\nIt made larger demands upon faith.\r\n\r\nThen it began to require a little aid from man himself, on the principle\r\nthat God helps them that help themselves, the cleaning up by men of the\r\nhuman rubbish heap, the purging of autocracy by democracy. Human\r\nresponsibility began to emerge. The picture in our heads was changing.\r\n\r\nThen, as the war came to a close it became apparent that President\r\nWilson's happy idea that democracies, being stupid and unready to fight,\r\nwould live together in eternal peace, was inadequate. The treaty would\r\nleave the three great democracies armed as the autocracies never had\r\nbeen armed. They might elect to remain so and use their weapons as\r\nprovocatively as any Hapsburg or Hohenzollern ever did. Men must\r\norganize, must league themselves together, must govern themselves\r\ninternationally in order to have peace, which was no longer an\r\naccidental by-product of the modern factory, but must be created by men\r\nthemselves, deliberately acting to that end. Men must work out their own\r\nsalvation, aided and admonished of course by such perfect works of\r\nprogress as a war to end war.\r\n\r\nMen make the attempt. The peoples of the earth assemble and write a\r\ntreaty which keeps the chief democratic nations on the continent of\r\nEurope armed against each other, which provides endless subjects of\r\ndispute among the smaller countries; and they sign a covenant which the\r\nunanimous opinion of mankind rejects as an effective safeguard against\r\nfuture wars and which many regard as dividing the earth into two hostile\r\ncamps. \"It was humanity's failure,\" declares General Smuts. \"There will\r\nalways be war,\" asserts President Harding, calling a conference not to\r\nend war but to lessen the cost of preparing for war.\r\n\r\nNot only has material progress failed to produce peace as its\r\nby-product, but moral progress has failed to produce peace as its\r\ndeliberate product.\r\n\r\nAnd Progress is in reality moving forward to wars more deadly and more\r\nruinous than the last. Weapons were developed toward the end of the\r\nGreat War capable of vastly worse havoc than any used during its course.\r\nAnd only a beginning has been made. If we may come to use the power that\r\nholds atoms together in the driving of engines, we may also use it in\r\nwar to blast whole cities from the face of the earth. Conquest of the\r\nair means larger bombs from the air. Greater knowledge of chemistry\r\nmeans industrial advancement and also deadlier poison gases. Material\r\ngains bring compensating material ills or the possibility of them.\r\n\r\nEven the material gains, great as they have been, seem somewhat smaller\r\ntoday than they once were thought to be. In our most optimistic moments\r\nbefore the war we had the pleasant illusion of steadily decreasing hours\r\nof labor and steadily lowering costs. Men had worked twelve, ten, and\r\nfinally eight hours a day, and it was predicted that this process would\r\ngo on until six, perhaps four hours a day would be sufficient to supply\r\nthe needs of the race.\r\n\r\nWe paid five cent fares on the street cars and were hopeful that they\r\nwould become three cent fares; three cents was established by law in\r\nmany cities as the maximum charge. The railroads collected a little over\r\ntwo cents a mile for carrying passengers and in many states statutes\r\nwere enacted establishing two cents a mile as the legal rate. We were\r\nimpressed by striking examples of lowering prices, in the automobile\r\nindustry for example, and were confident that this was the rule of\r\nmodern life.\r\n\r\nPrices, except of food products, were steadily decreasing; there might\r\nbe an end to this movement but we were nowhere near the end. The wonders\r\nof modern inventions, and if not these, the economics of concentrated\r\norganization, and if not these, the use of by-products, were steadily\r\nlowering costs. The standard of living was rising. What was the rich\r\nman's luxury in one generation was the poor man's necessity in the next.\r\nIt would always be so. That was Progress.\r\n\r\nWe now pay seven or eight cents to ride on street cars and more than\r\nthree cents a mile to travel on trains. All prices have advanced. The\r\nstandard of living has declined and we ask ourselves if it will not have\r\nto decline still further. No one now talks of a six-hour day. We\r\nrecognize a check in the process toward increasing well-being at less\r\neffort. Life has become more difficult. Progress is no longer a simple\r\nand steady movement onward in a single direction. Like evolution\r\nsometimes it seems to stand still or perhaps go back. Like evolution it\r\nrequires a _vital elan_; it is a thing of leaps and rests. We are less\r\nenthusiastic about it when it rests.\r\n\r\nWe blame our discomfiture, the higher prices and the lower standard of\r\nliving on the war, but much of it was inevitable, war or no war. The\r\nidea that the struggle for existence would grow steadily easier was\r\nlargely a conclusion from appearances. We were raising our standard of\r\nliving by skimming the cream of our natural resources. When our original\r\nforests were cut, when the most easily mined veins of iron and coal were\r\nexhausted, when oil wells ceased to gush and had to be pumped, unless\r\nsubstitutes were found, all the basic costs of production would advance.\r\nUltimately they would advance to the point where economies of\r\norganization, of quantity production, of by-product development, so far\r\nas they have been realized, would no longer serve to keep down final\r\nprices. We were rapidly reaching that point when the war came.\r\n\r\nWe lived under an illusion. What we called the results of progress was\r\nthe rapid exhaustion of easily available resources. We used our capital\r\nand thought ourselves rich. And we lie under a burden of debt made much\r\nheavier by the weapons which progress put into our hands. Progress had\r\nnot made war too expensive to fight but it had made peace too expensive\r\nto be borne. We forgot the law of diminishing returns. We ignored the\r\nlessons of history that all ages come to an end, when the struggle for\r\nexistence once more grows severe until new instruments are found equal\r\nto the further conquest over nature. Useful inventions have not kept\r\npace with increasing consumption and rapidly disappearing virgin\r\nresources. The process of steadily lowering costs of production has\r\nstopped and reverse process has set in. Spectacular inventions like the\r\nairplane have deluded us into the belief that Progress, always blessing\r\nus, we had the world by the tail. But coal and iron became harder and\r\ncostlier to mine. Oil neared exhaustion. Timber grew scarcer.\r\nAgricultural lands smaller in proportion to population.\r\n\r\nImmense possibilities lie before us. So they did before the man with the\r\nstone hatchet in his hand, but he waited long for the steam, saw and\r\ndrill and crusher. An invention which would mean as much in the conquest\r\nof nature as did the steam engine would make the war debt as easily\r\nborne as the week's account at the grocery store. But when will progress\r\nvouchsafe it? Converting coal into power we waste 85 per cent of its\r\nenergy in coal and call that efficient. But does Progress always respond\r\ninstantly to our needs with new methods and devices, like a nurse\r\nresponding to a hungry child? A few years ago we were sure it did, but\r\nnow we look anxiously at the skies for a sign.\r\n\r\nWe had another characteristic pleasant illusion during the war.\r\nProgress, like the Lord, in all previous conflicts was on our side. Here\r\nwas a great need of humanity. Surely, according to rule, it should be\r\nmet by some great invention that would blast the Germans out of their\r\nplaces in the earth and give the sons of light an easy and certain\r\nvictory. All the familiars of the deity sat about in boards watching for\r\nthe indication that the engine to meet the needs of civilization had\r\nbeen granted. But it never was.\r\n\r\nI do not write this to suggest that men, especially American men, have\r\nceased to believe in Progress. They would be fools if they had. I write\r\nto suggest that they have ceased to believe in Progress. They would be\r\nfools if they had not. A great illusion is gone, one of the chief\r\ndislocations wrought by the war.\r\n\r\nWhat the war has done to our way of thinking has been to lay a new\r\nstress upon man as a free and responsible agent. After all the battles\r\nwere won not by guns, or tanks or gas or airplanes, but as always by the\r\ncommon man offering his breast to the shots of the enemy. The hope of\r\nthe future is all in human organizations, in societies of nations, in\r\ncouncils and conferences. Men's minds turn once more to governments with\r\nrenewed expectation. Not only do we think for the first time seriously\r\nof a government of the world but we focus more attention on the\r\ngovernment at Washington. Groups with special interests to serve reach\r\nout openly to control it.\r\n\r\nThe war laid a new emphasis on government. Not only did the government\r\nhave our persons and our lives at its command but it assumed authority\r\nover our food, it directed our factories and our railroads, it told us\r\nwhat we could manufacture and ship, it decided who could borrow of the\r\ngeneral credit and for what purposes, it fixed the prices at which we\r\ncould buy and sell. It came to occupy a new place in the national\r\nconsciousness and one which it will never wholly lose. One rival to\r\nit,--the belief, having its roots in early religious ideas, and\r\nstrengthened by scientific theory and the outward results of the great\r\ninventions, that moved by some irresistible impulse, life went steadily\r\nforward to higher and higher planes, and that man had but little to do\r\nbut pluck the fruits of progress--has been badly shattered by events.\r\n\r\nBut men do not change beliefs suddenly. Perhaps after all the war was\r\nonly the way of progress--to usher in a new and brilliant day. Perhaps\r\nthe unfolding future has something near in store far greater and better\r\nthan went before. We shall not trust men too far, men with their\r\nobstinate blindness, men with their originally sinful habit of thinking\r\nthey know better than the forces which rule the world. We want not\r\nleaders but weather cocks, who will veer to the kindlier wind that may\r\nblow when it is yet only a zephyr.\r\n\r\nWe turn to men yet, we cling a little to the hope that fate will yet\r\nsave us. This division in us accounts for Lloyd George and Harding, our\r\nown commonplace \"best we have on hand\" substitute for the infinitely\r\nvariable Englishman, adjusted to every breath that blows, who having no\r\nset purpose of his own offers no serious obstacle to any generous design\r\nof fate.\r\n\r\nSenator Borah once said to me, \"The Administration has no definite\r\npolicies.\" And it is not Mr. Harding's fault. If he wanted to form any\r\nthe people wouldn't let him. They elected him not to have any. They\r\ndesired in the White House some one who would not look further ahead\r\nthan the next day until the future became clearer. If he had purposes\r\nevents might prove them to be wrong.\r\n\r\nThe same fundamental idea underlay the remark of a member of the\r\nCabinet, at the outset of the recent disarmament and Far Eastern\r\nConference, that \"Lloyd George was the hope of the gathering because he\r\nhad no principles.\"\r\n\r\nThe war destroyed many men but it half restored Man. You see how\r\ninevitable optimism is. The ways of Progress are indeed past finding\r\nout. Governments during it performed the impossible. They even took in\r\nhand the vast industrial mechanism which we ordinarily leave to the\r\ncontrol of the \"forces.\" We half suspect they might do the impossible in\r\npeace but we half hope that some kindlier fate is in store for us than\r\nto trust ourselves to human intelligence. We don't know whether to put\r\nour money on Man or on Progress; so we put it on Mr. Harding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nGOLDEN WORDS TURN TO BRASS\r\n\r\n\r\nUnlike government by Progress, government by business, by the\r\nsemi-sacred intermediaries between the will to increase and the rest of\r\nus, began to disintegrate before the war; which merely completed the\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nLet us consider what has happened in the last few years to government by\r\nbusiness, that government which the smoking compartment philosopher has\r\nin mind when he says so hopefully of Mr. Harding: \"_They_ will see to it\r\nthat he gets along all right.\"\r\n\r\nThe first manifestation of nationality in this country was the\r\nnationality of business. Before industry became national nothing was\r\nnational. The United States was a pleasant congeries of localities. It\r\nwas held together by reading everywhere the story of the Battle of\r\nBunker Hill in the same school history, which sometimes bore a different\r\nauthor's name but which was always the same history. \"Don't fire till\r\nyou can see the whites of their eyes\" and \"If we don't hang together we\r\nshall all hang separately\" were the unifying bond, and they were enough.\r\nWe had the same sense of identity as an infant has when it becomes aware\r\nthat the delightful toe and the delightful mouth where it is inserted\r\nappertain vaguely to the one ego. The local factory and the local bank\r\nsubtended the entire arc of economic consciousness. There was one\r\nsingle-track railroad which ran from Podunk to Peopack and another from\r\nPeopack to Peoria, unrelated, discontinuous.\r\n\r\nIn those simple times when business was local the local factory owner,\r\nbanker, or railroad builder was the hero of his neighborhood. It was he\r\nwho \"put the town on the map.\" He gave it prosperity. He built it by\r\nattracting labor into his employment. He gave it contact with the\r\noutside world. If you owned town lots it was he who gave them value and\r\nit was he who might take away their value if he was offended. If you had\r\na general store it was he who added to its patronage by adding to the\r\npopulation. If you raised farm products nearby it was he who improved\r\nyour market. He built the fine house which it was your pride to show\r\nvisitors. Your success and happiness was bound up in his. He conferred\r\nhis blessings for a consideration, for you were careful to make no laws\r\nwhich restricted the freedom of his operations. You permitted him a vast\r\nunofficial \"say\" in your local government; you gave him a little the\r\nbest of it in the assessment for taxes. You felt a little lifted up by\r\nhis condescension in calling you by your first name and stopping to ask\r\nabout your family on the street corner. You were jealous of his rights\r\nbecause after all the value of your own depended upon his use of his.\r\n\r\nWhen business figures arose upon the national horizon they were merely\r\nthese local figures vastly multiplied. As a people we called them \"Jim\"\r\nand \"Jay,\" and \"Dan'l,\" just as we had called the local manufacturer and\r\nbanker by their first names. All the good will that went to the local\r\nbusiness leaders went to them. They put money into our pockets, when\r\nthey didn't happen to take it out of our pockets; on the whole they were\r\ndoing the great work of making this country a richer and better land.\r\nSome who did not conceive the resources of the printing press in the\r\nissuance of new securities had to suffer, but that was their lookout;\r\nsuffering for some was the way of the world.\r\n\r\nBusiness began to be national in the tying together into systems the\r\nlittle dislocated railroads that local enterprise had laid down and in\r\nthe creation of a national securities market for the distribution of\r\nownership in the new combinations.\r\n\r\nA new era opened when Gould and Fisk and Drew started at full speed\r\ntheir rival printing presses in Wall Street. Look over our whole drab\r\npolitical story from the death of Lincoln to the arrival of Roosevelt,\r\nmore than a generation, and, if we did not preserve the names of our\r\nPresidents in our histories, how many names are there worth\r\nremembering? Garfield was shot, which was dramatic. Cleveland was a fat\r\nman who used long Latin words. He was also the first Democratic chief\r\nexecutive in more than thirty years. What else? Who else?\r\n\r\nMeanwhile an amazing array of business personages diverted attention\r\nfrom the inconspicuous Hayeses, Arthurs, and McKinleys, who were the\r\nflower of our public life. Gould, Fisk, Drew, Hill, Carnegie, the\r\nRockefellers, Harriman, Morgan, Ryan--business was fertile of men,\r\npolitics sterile; you have to go back to the foundation of the\r\ngovernment for a period so prolific in men, of the other sort, or to the\r\nage of Elizabeth or of Pericles for another as prolific in men, of still\r\nanother kind. How could the dull sideshow in Washington compete with the\r\nbig spectacle in New York?\r\n\r\nThese demigods of business were not only shining personalities; they\r\nwere doing the work of making America great and rich; we all shared in\r\nthe prosperity they were creating. To go back to the small town again,\r\nwho was it increased the opportunities of the storekeeper, the\r\nneighboring farmer, or real estate holder? Was it the mayor and the\r\ncommon council by passing ordinances about street signs and sidewalk\r\nencumbrances? Or the manufacturer or railroad builder who put the town\r\non the map, giving employment to labor or an outlet for its products?\r\n\r\nThe government at Washington occupied a place in our consciousness\r\nsimilar to that of the government of the small town. It was charged with\r\nour national defense, a function of such little importance that we had\r\nhardly an army or a navy. It conducted our economic defense, against the\r\nforeigner, with laws written, however, by business itself, which\r\nnaturally knew best how it wanted to be defended; you could not, in your\r\nproper senses, suppose that the Hayeses, Arthurs, and McKinleys were\r\nwiser than the Carnegies, Hills, Morgans, or Harrimans. For the rest it\r\nwas told severely to let well enough alone. To make assurance doubly\r\nsure that it would do so it was rather openly given over to the great\r\nmen who were creating the national wealth.\r\n\r\nStarting with the combination of the little speculatively built\r\nrailroads into systems and the development of a security market to float\r\nthe shares of stock in the new companies, business took on rapidly a\r\nmore and more national character. Great bankers arose to finance the\r\nconsolidations. An investing public with a wider horizon than that which\r\nused to put its money in local enterprises entrusted its funds in the\r\nhands of the great bankers or took its chances in the market for stocks.\r\nIndustry went through a similar concentration. Stronger companies\r\nabsorbed their weaker and less successful rivals. The same bankers who\r\nsat in the boards of directors of the railroads representing their\r\ninvesting public took their places in the directorate of manufacturing\r\ncombinations.\r\n\r\nThe railroads seeking the business of the big industrial companies and\r\nthe big industrial companies desiring favors from the railroads placed\r\nrepresentatives in each others' boards. This interlocking created a\r\nnational organization of business dominated by a few striking and\r\nspectacular figures.\r\n\r\nThe popular imagination was as much heated over the discovery of the\r\nUnited States as a single field of enterprise as the imagination of\r\nEurope had been centuries earlier over the discovery of the new world.\r\n\r\nThe psychology of the local industry period carried over into this new\r\nperiod of national industry. The whole country became one vast small\r\ntown. The masters of industry, banking, and the railroads were the\r\nleading citizens. They were \"putting the United States on the map,\" as\r\nthe local creator of wealth had put the small town on the map. They were\r\ndoing something vast, from which we all undoubtedly benefited. Perhaps\r\nwe could not trace our advantage so immediately as we could to the\r\nenterprise of the man who brought population to our town, swelling the\r\nprice of our real estate or increasing the sales at our stores. But what\r\nhad been a matter of experience on a small scale was a matter of belief\r\non a large scale. The same consequences must follow, with manifold\r\nabundance. And the nation was demonstrably growing rapidly, immensely\r\nricher; surely cause and effect.\r\n\r\nBusiness had from the first taken on among us, as Mr. Lowes Dickinson\r\nremarks, a religious character; and when by a great thrust it\r\noverreached the bounds of locality and became national, its major\r\nprophets emerged. Mr. Van Wyck Brooks quotes Mark Twain as writing: \"The\r\nwords of a proprietor of a rich coal mine have a golden sound, and his\r\ncommon sayings are as if they were solid wisdom.\" How much more of this\r\nsacred character inhered in the heroes who created nationwide railroad\r\nsystems, vast steelmaking consolidations, monopolies of oil and coal!\r\n\r\nWhen a New York lawyer said of E. H. Harriman that he moved in spheres\r\nwhich no one else dare tread, he was putting, a little late, into words\r\nthe national awe of the men who had overleapt the bounds of locality and\r\nbestrode the continent industrially, the heads of the vast business\r\nhierarchy. When Mr. Baer said that he operated the Reading Railroad by\r\ndivine right he said only what a worshipping people had taught him to\r\nthink. Those men did not use this half-religious language by accident;\r\nthey crystallized into phrases the feeling of the country toward those\r\nwho had done God's work of making it rich, making it successful.\r\n\r\nEach like an unconscious Cervantes helped to laugh our industrial\r\nchivalry away.\r\n\r\nHow easy it is to believe about yourself what everyone believes about\r\nyou! How hard not to! How easy to believe that you rule railroads by\r\n\"divine right,\" or walk in \"higher spheres,\" when the whole unexpressed\r\nconsciousness of a hundred million people assigns you just such hieratic\r\nappurtenances and privileges. How doubt in the face of all this\r\nevidence? They identified themselves with Progress, and Progress was\r\nwhat ruled the world. If you have faith and if you are fortified with\r\nthe faith of others, self-identification with one of the larger forces\r\nis not difficult. Was not what they were doing Progress, was it not the\r\nrealization of that benignant will to the utter blossoming of chaos into\r\nutility which was planned in the beginning? Were they not instruments\r\nrather than mere men, instruments of the greater purpose of which\r\nAmerica was the perfect work? If you believe in theocratic forces you\r\nbelieve also in chosen human agencies for carrying them out.\r\n\r\nThey were more than instruments of Progress. I have spoken of government\r\nby economic law as having challenged political government in the\r\nconsciousness of the people. As a country we perhaps believe in economic\r\nlaw more firmly than any nation in the world. Wasn't America being\r\nproduced in accordance with economic law and wasn't America one of the\r\nmarvels of the earth? I asked a salesman recently, a man with no\r\npersonal interests which would give him the prejudices of the business\r\nworld, why he hated Henry Ford. \"Because,\" he replied instantly and\r\nwithout hesitation, \"he defies economic law.\" He spoke like a true\r\nAmerican. To defy economic law and make money at it is like selling the\r\nSavior for twenty pieces of silver.\r\n\r\n\"The physical laws,\" says De Gourmont, \"promulgated or established by\r\nthe scientists, are confessions of ignorance. When they cannot explain a\r\nmechanism they declare its movements are due to a law. Bodies fall by\r\nvirtue of the law of gravitation. This has precisely the same value in\r\nthe serious order as the comic _virtus dormitiva_.\" In the promulgation\r\nof economic law our interest perverts the simple and just operation of\r\nour ignorance. In the field of physical phenomena we perceive a series\r\nof uniform events and call that uniformity a law. In the field of\r\neconomic phenomena we perceive a series of events uniformly serving our\r\ninterests and call that uniformity a law.\r\n\r\nThese greater business men of the past fruitful generation operated on\r\nthe whole over a long period of falling prices. Wealth accumulated. You\r\nread about it in the government reports, dividing the total by the total\r\npopulation. The division thus effected was mighty assuring. Labor was\r\nbetter paid. Higher institutions of learning multiplied. Libraries\r\nhoused in marble grew upon every crossroads. Intellectual as well as\r\nmaterial needs were in process of being better satisfied. We were\r\napproaching an age when ink upon white paper, now so cheap, cheaper\r\nthan ever in the pitiful past, should lift humanity to a new and higher\r\nlevel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REPRESENTATIVE FRANK W. MONDELL OF WYOMING]\r\n\r\nThe evidence was conclusive. These greater business men were in supreme,\r\nin conspicuous direction of the country's development. The happiest\r\nresults followed. They worked in harmony with economic law, for they\r\nprospered gloriously and one could no more break economic law and\r\nprosper than one could break criminal law and keep out of jail. Until\r\nFord came no one could defy economic law with impunity.\r\n\r\nAnd law and justice being two ideas that associate themselves together\r\nin the human mind, in a binder of optimism perhaps, like the disparate\r\nelements that form clinkers in a furnace, they were accomplishing that\r\nperfect work of the justice which inhered in things at the beginning,\r\nwhen tiny atoms with the urge to produce an earth fit for man to live\r\non, to produce America in short, began to discover affinities for each\r\nother. No wonder they penetrated \"higher spheres\" ruled by \"divine\r\nright,\" and that \"golden words\" dropped from their mouths. Progress,\r\ndestiny, an instinct for economic law, it was much to unite one man.\r\n\r\nAgain, they were more than this. Men cannot be so universally looked to\r\nfor the welfare of the nation as they were, without becoming in effect\r\nthe government of that nation. Business and the government were one.\r\nPublic opinion at that time would have regarded an administration which\r\ndefied the great commercial interests as dangerous to the country's\r\nadvancement. Lawyers like Mr. Knox or Mr. Root, who had proved their\r\nvalue to them, went to the Senate as their spokesmen. Able and ambitious\r\nmen in both Houses of Congress, wishing power and influence, became\r\ntheir agents. The chairmen of the important committees of both houses\r\nwere in their confidence and spoke with authority because of what they\r\nrepresented. Some of the virtue of the great, some shadow of divine\r\nright, descended upon them. Among valets the valet of the king is king.\r\n\r\nWe forget, in the great outcry that was raised a few years ago over the\r\n\"invisible government,\" that the invisible government was once\r\nsufficiently visible, almost consciously recognized, and fully accepted.\r\nIt seemed the most natural thing in the world that the men who were\r\nmaking the country rich, making it a nation economically, should work\r\ntheir will freely at Washington. We jealously guarded their liberties.\r\nWoe unto the legislator who would interfere with their freedom to\r\ncontract, for example, for the labor of children, which we described as\r\nthe freedom of children to sell their labor advantageously. Adult labor\r\nbanding together to arrange terms of its own sale was felt to be a\r\npublic enemy. Every age has its fetish; the medicine man who could\r\nexorcise the evil spirit in stone and bush was not a more privileged\r\ncharacter than his successor at whose touch prosperity sprang out of\r\nthe earth, at whose word the mysterious economic forces which might in\r\ntheir wrath prove so destructive, bowed and became kind.\r\n\r\nMake a few individuals the embodiment of a national purpose that has\r\nlong existed, unconscious and unquestioned, give them as you inevitably\r\ndo in such a case the utmost freedom that is possible on this earth, let\r\nthem be limited enough mentally so that they are blind to any other\r\npossible purpose; do all these things and you produce great men. It was\r\nan age of great men, Rockefellers, Carnegies, Morgans, Hills, Ryans,\r\nHarrimans, and a host of others, richer in personalities than any other\r\nperiod of American life except that which produced Washington, Hamilton,\r\nFranklin, Jefferson, and Marshall. They were the flowering of the whole\r\npioneer civilization.\r\n\r\nOne hundred and fifty years of freedom has produced few free men.\r\nPerhaps these were all. They may not have been free intellectually.\r\nCharles Francis Adams writes of their kind: \"I have known, and known\r\ntolerably well, a good many successful men,--'big' financially, men\r\nfamous during the last half century; and a less interesting crowd I do\r\nnot care to encounter. Not one that I have ever known would I care to\r\nmeet again, nor is one of them associated in my mind with the idea of\r\nhumor, thought, or refinement.\"\r\n\r\nNever mind. They were free in all the essential ways. The men of whom\r\nAdams wrote had no such sense of their limitations as he expressed.\r\nOnly an Adams would then have had it, and the Adamses were not what M.\r\nGaltier of _Le Temps_ suggested when, hastily absorbing the American\r\nspirit at Washington, he said to me: \"I am reading _The Education of\r\nHenry Adams_: He was what you would call a typical American, was he\r\nnot?\"\r\n\r\nAn Adams, even Charles Francis Adams, writing of that time, was\r\nuntypical enough, to have missed the point, which was not whether these\r\nmen \"'big' financially\" were interesting, witty, thoughtful, or refined,\r\nbut whether they were free. And they were; they were so sure of\r\nthemselves, and public opinion was so sure of them, that they\r\nconcentrated on the one great aim of that simple day, and did not waste\r\nthemselves upon non-essentials like \"humor, thought, or refinement.\"\r\n\r\nI have a theory that we are wrong in ascribing the poverty of American\r\nliterature and statesmanship to the richness of our business life. \"All\r\nour best and ablest minds went into commerce,\" we say. We flatter\r\nourselves. Mr. Carnegie, born in the days of Elizabeth, might not have\r\nbeen Shakespeare. Mr. Harriman was perhaps, after all, no mute Milton,\r\nMr. Morgan no Michaelangelo.\r\n\r\nThese brave spirits developed in business not so much perhaps because of\r\nthe national urge to \"conquer a continent\" as because in business,\r\nenjoying the immunity it then did, they found the utmost opportunity for\r\nself-expression, the one great measure of freedom which this free\r\ncountry afforded. A jealous public guarded their divine right from\r\nimpious hands. They believed in themselves. The people believed in them.\r\nSo the flowering of the pioneer age came, in such a race of men as are\r\nnot on the earth today, and the rule of business reached its climax.\r\n\r\nIt was an autumn flowering, rich and golden like the Indian summer of\r\nNew England culture, a sign that a cycle was run. Adams sniffing from\r\nthe transcendental heights of Boston wrote: \"a race of mere\r\nmoney-getters and traders.\" Remember the sneers in our cocksure press of\r\nthose days at the \"culture\" of Boston? Boston has had its revenge. The\r\nwords \"mere money-getters\" bit in. There were other objects in life\r\nbeside pioneering the industrial opportunities of a whole continent just\r\nbrought together into commercial unity. Mr. Morgan began to buy art. Mr.\r\nCarnegie began to buy libraries and started authorship himself. The men\r\n\"'big' financially\" began to look over their shoulders and see the\r\nshadows--as we all do now--where they a little before kept their eyes\r\nstraight forward and saw the one clear vision, the truth, such as it\r\nwas, that made them free.\r\n\r\nI have traced that element in the American political consciousness,\r\ngovernment by business, to its highest moment.\r\n\r\n\"Divine right\" is only safe when it is implicit. When you begin to avow\r\nit, as Mr. Baer did, it is already in question. The national passion\r\nfor equality began to work. Had not Mr. Carnegie confessed the weakness\r\nin his soul's fortress by writing a book? Had not Mr. Morgan by buying\r\nart suggested the one aim of pioneering on a grand scale might not be\r\nlife's sole end?\r\n\r\nMr. Baer with his avowal, Mr. Carnegie and Mr. Morgan with their seeking\r\nof the broader satisfactions, Mr. Schwab behaving like a king in exile\r\nat the gaming tables of Monte Carlo, may have invited what followed. But\r\nthey were only expressing in their own way the sense becoming general\r\nthat pioneering was over and that its ideals were too narrow and too\r\nfew--even if no clear sense was coming of what state and what ideals\r\nwere to take their place. Men turn from leaders whose day of greatest\r\nusefulness is past and set up new leaders against them. Against the\r\ngovernment by business the first great national unity that entered the\r\nAmerican consciousness they began to erect the state, the national\r\ngovernment at Washington.\r\n\r\nNo one meant to end government by business and substitute for it\r\ngovernment by the people. Not for a moment. We devised a new set of\r\nchecks and balances, like that between the various branches provided for\r\nin our Constitution, a new political organism which should equal and\r\ncoexist with the one we already had. The government personified by Mr.\r\nRoosevelt was the check and balance to the government personified by\r\nMr. Harriman and Mr. Morgan. Governments never die but merely recede in\r\nthe national consciousness, like the old clothes which we keep in the\r\nattic. Thus revolutions never effect a revolution; democracy is only a\r\nTroy built upon nine other prehistoric Troys: beneath, you find\r\naristocracy, rule by divine right, despotism, theocracy, and every other\r\ngovernance on which men in their invincible optimism have pinned their\r\nfaith.\r\n\r\nThe revolution which Mr. Roosevelt brought about was the kind which\r\nexclaims loudly \"malefactors of great wealth\" while writing to Mr.\r\nHarriman \"we are both practical men.\" It was the kind of revolution this\r\ncountry desired. The nation wished to eat its cake and have it, to\r\nretain government by business and have alongside it another government,\r\nas powerful, as interesting, as colorful, as rich in personalities, as\r\nthe late autumn of pioneering had brought into gorgeous bloom.\r\n\r\nMr. Roosevelt's method with the new government was this: Senator Aldrich\r\nand Speaker Cannon representing the still powerful coexistent government\r\nby business in Congress, would call at the White House and tell the\r\nPresident just how far he could go and no further. They would emerge. A\r\nmoment later the press in response to a summons would arrive. Mr.\r\nRoosevelt would say: \"I have just sent for Mr. Aldrich and Mr. Cannon\r\nand forced them to accept my policy, etc.\" Nobody was deceived. Unlike\r\nthe philosopher who made all knowledge his province, Mr. Roosevelt made\r\nall knowledge his playground, and not only all knowledge but all the\r\narts, including the art of government.\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Roosevelt's day the two governments, government by business and\r\npolitical government, existed side by side, of about equal proportions;\r\nand no one really wished either to overtop the other. We were indulging\r\nin revolution with our customary prudence.\r\n\r\nThe human passion for equality which had risen against the last of those\r\ndominant figures, the last and greatest of the pioneers, and started to\r\nset up representatives of the public as great as they were, was\r\nsingularly fortunate in its first manifestations. It \"found a man,\" in\r\nthat most amazing jack-of-all-trades, Mr. Roosevelt.\r\n\r\nIf business had its array of extraordinary personalities, the rival\r\nestablishment had its Roosevelt, who surrounded himself with a shining\r\ngroup of amateurs, Mr. Root, Mr. Knox, General Wood, James Garfield, Mr.\r\nPinchot, Mr. Knox Smith, the \"Tennis Cabinet,\" to all of whom he\r\nsucceeded in imparting some vividness from his own abounding\r\npersonality. If pioneers from the days of Daniel Boone on have been\r\nromantic, amateurs are equally romantic. It was romance against romance.\r\n\r\nThe balance between the two governments did not last long. Government by\r\nbusiness was declining. It was being extruded from the control of\r\npolitical affairs. Political government was rising. It was reaching out\r\nto control certain phases of business itself. The great pioneers of\r\nnational industry were growing old. They were becoming self-conscious,\r\nvaguely aware of changing circumstances, casting about for solider\r\nfoundations than \"mere money getting,\" buying art and writing books,\r\nestablishing foundations, talking foolishly about their \"divine right,\"\r\nabout the crime of \"dying rich.\"\r\n\r\nA race of gamblers came in their train who caricatured their activities.\r\nThe great figures who were passing took long chances magnificently,\r\npioneer fashion, \"to strike it rich,\" to found industries or magnify\r\navenues of trade. Their imitators, the Gateses, Morses, Heinzes,\r\nand ---- took long chances vulgarly for the excitement there was in them.\r\n\r\nRailroads had to be \"rescued\" from them. Wall Street had to organize its\r\nVigilantes against them.\r\n\r\nI went as a reporter to see ---- once in New York and found him in his\r\nlibrary drinking. He sent for his servant, ordered six bottles of\r\nchampagne at once, and after his man had gone opened the whole six, one\r\nafter another, on his library rug. He had to exhibit in some way his\r\nlarge manner of doing things, and this was the best way he could think\r\nof at the moment. He belonged to a fevered race, intoxicated with the\r\nidea of bigness, juggling millions about to no more useful end than\r\nthat of pouring champagne on a carpet. They were the _reductio ad\r\nabsurdum_ of the pioneer.\r\n\r\nThe public no longer put its faith blindly as before in those romantic\r\nfigures, the great industrial pioneers, those Mississippi River pilots\r\nwho knew every rock and reef in the river. Stripped of much power and\r\nprestige, no longer looked to without question for the safety of the\r\ncountry, that magnificent species, the great pioneer, disappeared. It is\r\nas dead and gone as that equally magnificent species the Mississippi\r\npilot of Mark Twain's day.\r\n\r\nThe legitimate succession was the dynasty--it was the dynasty that\r\ndestroyed belief in the divine right of kings--of the second generation,\r\nof the younger Stillman, of the younger Rockefeller, competent but\r\nunremarkable, of the younger Morgan, more capable than the rest,\r\ndoubtless, but compare his countenance with the eagle mien of his\r\npredecessor.\r\n\r\nI used often to discuss with Mr. Roosevelt the members of the dynasty.\r\nHe had no illusions. We both knew well a second-generation newspaper\r\nproprietor, a young man of excellent character, as prudent as the\r\nearlier generation had been daring, a petty King who always had an\r\naspiring Mayor of the palace at his elbow, inclined to go to sleep at\r\nhis post from excessive watching of his property. As we would go over\r\nthe names in the dynasty, Mr. Roosevelt would say almost invariably: \"I\r\ncan't describe him better to you than to say he's another ----,\" naming\r\nour mutual acquaintance, one of the many of his sort into whose hands by\r\ninheritance the control of business has descended.\r\n\r\nWhatever the reason is, whether the inertia of large organization and\r\nthe weakening of competition have favored the remaining in power of the\r\nsecond generation, whether we have evolved but one great type, the\r\npioneer, whose day is past, and have not yet differentiated the true\r\nbusiness man any more than we have differentiated the true statesman;\r\nwhether that psychological change which I have sought to trace, that\r\ndenial of freedom which once was the pioneers'--the new laws, the hard\r\nrestraints operating now upon business as upon everything else and\r\nenforcing conformity--there are today no Titans, no one stealing fire\r\nfrom the heaven of Progress for the benefit of the human race--unless\r\nHenry Ford--no Carnegies, Morgans, Rockefellers, Harrimans, of the\r\nblessed nineties.\r\n\r\nThe old sureness is gone. The great pioneers were never assailed by\r\ndoubts: they went straight forward, wearing the blinkers of a single\r\naim, which kept their eyes like those of harnessed horses in the narrow\r\nroad; God was with them, Progress was with them, Public Opinion was with\r\nthem, the government at Washington was with them.\r\n\r\nBut their successors, like everyone else, look over their shoulders and\r\nsee the shadows: see the government at Washington and attach a comic\r\nimportance to that bewildered figure; just as the government at\r\nWashington looks over its shoulder and sees at New York the government\r\nby business, its traditional master, and wishing a master, is unaware\r\nthat the twilight of the gods is come. And both see that greatest of all\r\nshadows, Public Opinion, the new monster of Frankenstein which everyone\r\nfeeds with propaganda, and fears. These three things were all one in the\r\nbright days of the great pioneers, and in that perfect unity everyone\r\nwas sure, so sure, and the few were free, so free!\r\n\r\nBusiness no longer imposes itself up on the imagination through its\r\nextraordinary personalities. In vain do we seek to recover the past. In\r\nvain does the popular magazine fiction strive to furnish what life no\r\nlonger does--the pioneer ideal, the hero who overcomes fire and flood\r\nand the machination of enemies and moves irresistibly forward to\r\nsuccess, who believes in himself, whose motto is that the will is not to\r\nbe gainsaid, whose life is one long Smile Week.\r\n\r\nVast propaganda exists to hold us true to the old faith; we read it as\r\nwe used to read Sunday School fiction; but religion only sought its way\r\ninto hearts within the covers of E. P. Roe when other channels began to\r\nclose. We beat the bushes for the great, the kings that should come\r\nafter Agamemnon. Monthlies of vast circulation tell us of every\r\njack-of-all-trades who hits upon a million dollars. This one found out\r\nhow to sell patches for automobile tires. That one was an office boy who\r\nnever knew when it became five o'clock in the afternoon. Our faith\r\nrequires vast stirring.\r\n\r\nTo the gradual weakening of the idea that business was all-wise and\r\nall-powerful, the war greatly contributed. Before 1914 men would say\r\nconfidently, \"Ah, but business, the bankers, will not let the nations\r\nfight. They have only to pull the strings of the purse and there will be\r\nno money for the fighters.\" After hostilities began they would say with\r\nequal confidence: \"It will be all over in six weeks. The bankers will\r\nnot let it go on.\"\r\n\r\nBusiness was, however, not only powerless to prevent war but it stood by\r\nimpotent while the very foundations on which it itself rested were\r\ndestroyed. One illusion went.\r\n\r\nThen again, during the war unorganized private production failed.\r\nPublicly organized production was immensely successful. Governments the\r\nworld over showed that the industrial mechanism could be made to run\r\nfaster and turn out more than ever before. The illusion that business\r\nwas a mystery understood only by initiates, the men \"'big' financially,\"\r\nwas shaken.\r\n\r\nAfter the war was over the government organization for regulating\r\nproduction was abandoned. A period of chaos, rising prices, speculation,\r\nwasteful production, of luxuries, ensued and then a crash. One may\r\nexplain all that happened in both cases on the basis of the war. But\r\nbusiness needed triumphs to restore its old place in the public\r\nconsciousness, and it has had instead a catastrophe.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of business today is its division. Many financial leaders\r\nsaw the depression that would follow peace. Frank A. Vanderlip, for one,\r\ncame back from Europe in 1919 full of warnings. He counselled\r\nmoderation. He urged deflation instead of further inflation. His advice\r\nwas unpopular with those who saw profits from a sudden withdrawal of\r\nwartime restraints. And the consequence of his prudence, according to\r\nwhat he has told his friends, was his being forced to retire from the\r\nPresidency of the great Wall Street bank of which he had been head.\r\n\r\nHenry Ford, moreover, is a destroyer of old illusions. He \"defies\r\neconomic laws.\" He does what business says is impossible. In a day of\r\nhigh prices he produces at an unprecedentedly low price. He does not cut\r\nwages. He finds a market where there is no market. To lower his costs he\r\nneeds cheaper steel than he can buy, so he manufactures it himself\r\ncheaper than the great steelmakers can manufacture it. He operates\r\nindependently of the \"big business\" group. Mr. Morgan sends for him and\r\nhe declines to go. He grows vastly rich, proving that all the knowledge\r\nthe men \"'big' financially\" have of the mystery of business is no\r\nknowledge at all, only rules made in their own interest.\r\n\r\nAnd business never twice answers the same question in the same way. One\r\nweek Mr. Morgan and the international bankers come to Washington and\r\ntell Mr. Harding that American credit must go into foreign trade. The\r\nnext week equally \"big\" bankers from the interior visit the capital and\r\ntell the President that American credit must stay at home developing\r\nAmerican industries. It is the same with the tariff. It is the same with\r\nthe taxes. Business is not of one mind about anything.\r\n\r\nA politician recently described business on errands of advice to\r\nWashington. \"One bunch of fat boys with high hats and morning coats\r\ncomes to Washington. The Administration holds out its nose wishing to be\r\nled by it. The fat boys decline the nose. They are not leading anybody.\r\nIn deprecatory manner they say: 'Please drive North. We think that is\r\nthe way.' They go. The next day another bunch of fat boys in high hats\r\nand morning coats arrives. Again the offer of the nose. Again the\r\ndeclination. And this time: 'Please drive South. We're sure that is the\r\nway.'\"\r\n\r\nThe government strains its ear to catch the word from Wall Street. But\r\nthere never was a time when business had less influence at Washington\r\nthan now. It is divided in its own mind, it is ruled by second-rate men.\r\nOf two governments that have occupied a place in the popular\r\nconsciousness, government by business and government by parties, I do\r\nnot know which is weaker. I do not know which has less unity and\r\ncapacity to function, the Republican party or big business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE SUPER-PRESIDENT GOES DOWN IN THE GENERAL SMASH\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we became doubtful, as pioneering drew to a close, that business\r\nserved a social end; when, becoming jealous of its great and\r\nirresponsible power, we started to set up an equal or greater authority\r\nin Washington, we followed the line of least resistance; we did the easy\r\nand obvious thing; we had recourse to a one man government.\r\n\r\nWe magnified the office of President and satisfied that primitive\r\ninstinct in us which must see the public welfare and the public safety\r\npersonified in a single individual, something visible, tangible,\r\npalpable. The President speaks and you read about him in the daily\r\npress; the President poses and you see him in the movies and feel\r\nassured, as in smaller realms under simpler conditions people were able\r\nto see their monarch dressed and equipaged in ways that connected him\r\nwith all the permanence of the past, a symbol of stability, wisdom, and\r\nthe divine favor.\r\n\r\nIf the trappings are lacking, imagination and the emotions supply their\r\nmoral equivalent. Of our little temporary king no one must speak evil;\r\nno voice may be raised in criticism.\r\n\r\nHis wife, up till some fourth of March an elderly country woman grown\r\ndull in the monotony of village life or worn with the task of pushing an\r\nunambitious husband forward to power, looking her most natural when in\r\nthe frankness of early morning unpreparedness she ran in her apron\r\nacross the street to gossip with the wife of a neighbor, becomes to the\r\nawed eyes of Washington women, quite \"beautiful.\" You hear them say it\r\nof every--let us quote the illuminating phrase--every \"first lady of the\r\nland.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Burke said that aristocracy was the most natural thing in the world\r\nhe did not go half far enough. The most natural thing in the world, the\r\nthing which is always repeating itself under no matter whatever form of\r\ngovernment exists, is an autocracy. In national emergencies, in times of\r\nperil, people put their fate in one man's hands; as in the late war when\r\nMr. Wilson was made by common consent a greater autocrat than any Czar\r\nof all the Russias.\r\n\r\nThe herd instinctively follows one authority. The mob is single-headed.\r\nAll the traditions of the race lead back toward despotism and it is\r\neasier to revert toward something primitive than to go forward toward\r\nsomething higher in the scale of development.\r\n\r\nAnd, moreover, the vital contacts of our lives are with authority\r\nimposed from above. Our childhood is controlled by the autocracy of the\r\nfamily. Education disposes of our hours, forces our inclinations,\r\nrepresses our individuality, and turns us out stamped with a uniform\r\nmark, the finished product of its unvarying course. The single head of\r\nthe classroom is the teacher. The single head of the school is the\r\nprincipal, of all the schools the Superintendent.\r\n\r\nMore important still, our economic lives are at the disposal of\r\nautocracy. We earn our livings under foremen and managers. Everywhere is\r\nthe boss who says to us \"Do this or starve.\" He represents to us not\r\nonly authority but wisdom. The organization out of which proceeds to us\r\nthe beneficent results of food and clothing operates because he is\r\nendowed with a knowledge which we have not. \"He knows about it all, he\r\nknows, he knows.\"\r\n\r\nIn all the essential everyday relations of life we have never been able\r\nto evolve any higher organization than that of the chieftain and his\r\ntribe. We read about democracy in the newspapers; once every two years\r\nor every four years we go through certain motions which vaguely relate\r\nto democracy, and which are not convincing motions.\r\n\r\nDemocracy is an artificial edifice imposed upon a society which is in\r\nall other than its political aspects entirely primitive. All our direct\r\nexperiences are of one man power. It is the only organization we\r\nactually know at first hand. We trust to it for the means to live. We\r\nrevert to it politically whenever it becomes an issue of life and death,\r\nand even in lesser emergencies.\r\n\r\nSo it came about that when we determined to have a government at\r\nWashington independent of and better representing the social will,\r\nwhatever that might come to be, than the government of business we had\r\nrecourse to that one form of rule which is ever present in our\r\nconsciousness, the only form under which the race has lived long enough\r\nto have any real faith in it.\r\n\r\nThe new social ideal had not sufficiently taken form to utilize all the\r\ncomplex institutions which existed in this country. Business was at that\r\ntime intrenched in Congress. It would have been a huge, an impossible\r\ntask, to re-make Congress, especially when no one knew definitely what\r\npurpose should animate the re-making. It was so much easier to find one\r\nman than to find many men. It is so much easier for a people which does\r\nnot know where it is going but means to go there to choose one man, and\r\nby an act of faith endow him with the divination of leadership, than it\r\nis to have a national will and express it through numerous\r\nrepresentatives.\r\n\r\nThe amplified executive is a sort of blind pool of the national\r\npurposes. Creating an autocracy is an act of faith; democracy is work.\r\nAnd faith is so much easier than work.\r\n\r\nWe did not think of it thus, as an exhibition of political inertia, as a\r\nreversion to an outworn type. On the contrary, we were immensely pleased\r\nwith our innovation. As usual the United States had made an immense\r\ncontribution to the art of government. We were repeating the race\r\nhistory of governments, as a child resumes in his life the race history\r\nof the human kind. We had got so far as to evolve that oldest of human\r\ninstitutions--autocracy, a mild, denatured autocracy. But we were as\r\nproud of it as a boy is when he put on paper with a pencil the very\r\npicture which his stone age ancestor cut laboriously into a walrus\r\ntooth.\r\n\r\nOur President had more power than the King of England, we boasted, more\r\nthan the Emperor of Germany. The monarchies of Europe were obsolete\r\nbecause they preserved autocracy out of the darkness of the Middle Ages.\r\nOur government was in the forefront of progress because it had created\r\nautocracy out of the suffrage of the people.\r\n\r\nAnd how clever we were with the restrictions of our written constitution\r\nwith its exact balance of powers, executive, legislative, and judicial.\r\nThe Fathers had builded wiser than they knew in writing an instrument by\r\nwhich the carefully distributed authority might be well reconcentrated;\r\nas if they were the first to use words whose import depended on the\r\npoint of view of those who interpreted them!\r\n\r\nAcres of space in the newspapers were covered with gratulatory articles\r\nproving that the dominating executive was the inevitable unifying\r\nprinciple in our disjointed and not otherwise workable government.\r\n\r\nOurs was a government by parties, so the argument ran, and the President\r\nwas the head of his party. As a matter of fact the writers of the\r\nConstitution had not conceived of a government by parties. What they had\r\nin mind was what they had before them in the Constitutional Convention\r\nof which they were a part, a government by the best and ablest men of\r\nthe community, who should meet together and select the executive; who\r\nshould equally through the state legislature choose the Senators. The\r\nrole of job brokers was the last thing they imagined themselves to be\r\ncreating. Parties came later. Ours was not originally a government of\r\nparties. It is hardly a government by parties today. So there was\r\nnothing inevitable about this great reason why the Executive should be\r\nthe element in our system which would hold it together and make it work.\r\n\r\nNor until the beginning of this century did it ever occur to us that the\r\nPresident was the head of his party. The control of the organization had\r\nbeen in other hands, in Hanna's or Quay's or Cameron's, or divided among\r\na group of men like these three, who represented the interests of\r\nbusiness in the parties, and often also in the Senate.\r\n\r\nThe idea that the executive was the party's head was merely a happy\r\nafterthought which was adopted to justify the resort to the line of\r\nleast resistance in creating a stronger government at Washington, the\r\nconcentration upon one man to represent the national will. We had simply\r\ndone what other peoples had so often done in the history of mankind.\r\nWhen the English wished to weaken the rule of the great barons they\r\nmagnified the office of the King. When we wished to get away from the\r\nrule of the barons of business we magnified the office of our elective\r\nKing, the President. We invented new reasons for an old expedient.\r\n\r\nAnd by making the amplified executive the head of his party, which we\r\ndid--for the Quays and Hannas speedily disappeared under the new order\r\nand left no successors--we set him to sawing off the limb on which he\r\nsat. If his authority rested on that of his party then to be firm the\r\nauthority of the party must be firm. For parties to endure and be strong\r\nthere must be a certain quality of permanence about them. They must not\r\nrest upon personalities but on principles and jobs, principles for the\r\ndisinterested and for those whose interests are expressed in the\r\nprinciples, and jobs for those whose interests are less large and\r\nindirect.\r\n\r\nOf parties with the executive as their head nothing remained but their\r\nname. The only nexus there could be between the executive and the mass\r\nof voters was personal. One year a party was Roosevelt, the next year it\r\nwas Taft and the distance between Roosevelt and Taft was the distance\r\nbetween East and West. A little later it even changed its name and voted\r\nin another column because Roosevelt had adopted a new party name and\r\ngone unto a new column. Four years later it split up and much of it went\r\nto Wilson, who temporarily rallied a personal following just as\r\nRoosevelt had done.\r\n\r\nAnd because the dispensing of jobs was an unseemly occupation for the\r\nexecutive we reduced by law the patronage that was available for the\r\nsustenance of parties. Thus we substituted personal caprice for the\r\npermanency of parties and at the same time cut down the practical means\r\nof holding organizations together. At the same time the decay of\r\ngovernment by business left parties no longer an instrument of the\r\neconomic will of the nation.\r\n\r\nThus the executive headship was wholly inconsistent with government by\r\nparties, upon which our magnified President was supposed to rest. A\r\nfurther inconsistency was that we adopted another theory for\r\nstrengthening one man power. This was that the President was the leader\r\nof the people. Have we a government by parties there? Not at all; the\r\npower of the executive rests upon something outside of and superior to\r\nparties.\r\n\r\nIf the legislative did not respond to pressure he might \"go to the\r\npeople,\" as it was called, through the newspapers and upon the stump. He\r\nmight discipline the recalcitrant by stirring up public sentiment\r\nagainst them. He might build up a personal following to such an extent\r\nthat his party must have it in order to win. He might encourage the\r\nmovement away from parties by attaching people to ideas and measures,\r\npolicies that the party had declined to accept. In this theory of\r\nexecutive power it was conceded that parties were not to be trusted. In\r\nthe other it was held that they were a necessary link between the\r\ndissociate branches of government.\r\n\r\nIt is no exaggerated notion that executive control of parties\r\ncontributed to the disintegration of party government. It is nothing\r\nmore than a statement of what actually happened. Roosevelt broke up the\r\nRepublican party nationally. He left it with its name covering an\r\nagglomeration of groups and blocs and personal followings, supporters of\r\nvarious interests difficult to reconcile, whose votes fluctuate from\r\nyear to year.\r\n\r\nMr. Hughes, the same kind of executive and party leader as governor of\r\nNew York, left the Republicans of that state in the hands of the little\r\nlocal banditti. Mr. La Follette, following the same methods as Governor\r\nof Wisconsin, left no one in that state definitely a Republican or a\r\nDemocrat. Every voter there is the personal follower of some chieftain.\r\n\r\nAnd what virtue is there in the theory that the Executive alone\r\nrepresents the national point of view, that he alone speaks \"for the\r\ncountry?\" Political inertia always finds good excuses.\r\n\r\nThere are reasons why the President should try to represent the country\r\nas a whole, since he is elected in a nationwide balloting. But there is\r\nno reason why he should succeed in representing the country as a whole,\r\nwhy he should have a national point of view.\r\n\r\nWhy should Mr. Harding have a vast understanding of national problems\r\nand a clear sense of the country's will? A little while ago he was a\r\nSenator, and the supposition that the Executive alone has the national\r\npoint of view implies that a Senator has not that point of view. Mr.\r\nHarding is chosen President and immediately upon his election by some\r\nmagic virtue of his office he is endowed with insight and imagination\r\nwhich he did not possess as Senator.\r\n\r\nMr. Harding is a good average President, a typical President, whether of\r\nthe United States or of a business corporation, just the kind of man to\r\nput at the head of a going concern where a plodding kind of safeness is\r\nrequired of the executive. We shall do well, should our standards of\r\npublic life remain what they are, if we have three Presidents superior\r\nto Mr. Harding in energy or originality of mind, during the whole of the\r\ncoming century. But why should Mr. Harding understand or represent the\r\nnational point of view?\r\n\r\nMr. Harding lived his life in the indolent comfortable mental\r\natmosphere of a small town. His horizon was narrow and there was no\r\nforce in him which made him seek to widen it. His public experience\r\nbefore coming to Washington consisted of brief service in the Ohio State\r\nlegislature and a term as Lieutenant-Governor of Ohio. His service in\r\nthe Senate at Washington was short and it was beginner's work,\r\nundertaken in the spirit of a man who finds the upper house a pleasant\r\nplace in which to pass the latter years of a never strenuous life.\r\n\r\nHis point of view on national problems was a second-hand point of view.\r\nHe knew about them what his party had said about them, in its platforms,\r\non the stump, in the press. He accepted the accepted opinions. No magic\r\nwrought by election to the Presidency could make of him or of anyone\r\nelse a great representative of the national purpose or endow him or\r\nanyone else with deep understanding of national problems.\r\n\r\nOf recent Presidents Mr. Taft failed so completely to understand his\r\npeople and express its will that after four years in office he could\r\ncommand the support of only two states when seeking re-election. Mr.\r\nWilson after four years had so far failed that only the incredible\r\nstupidity of his opponents enabled him to succeed himself; and again so\r\nfar, that his second term ended in a tragedy. The floundering of Mr.\r\nHarding is apparent to every eye.\r\n\r\nOnly under two Presidents has the theory of executive domination of the\r\nGovernment succeeded, and not completely under them. Congress rose\r\nagainst Mr. Roosevelt in the last year or two of his administration.\r\nCongress was not of Mr. Wilson's party, and was thus out of his control\r\nin the last two years of his administration. Mr. Taft lacked the will to\r\nrule. Mr. Harding is feebler than Mr. Taft, and party authority, one of\r\nthe pillars of executive power and responsibility, is now completely\r\nbroken down. A system which is successful only half the time cannot be\r\ncalled workable.\r\n\r\nLet us examine the circumstances under which the Executive was able to\r\nprevail over Congress and effect a limited sort of one man government.\r\nThey are not likely soon to repeat themselves.\r\n\r\nMr. Roosevelt was an extraordinary personality. Only Andrew Jackson,\r\namong our Presidents, was as picturesque as he, only Andrew Jackson had\r\na popular following comparable to his.\r\n\r\nBoth of them represented strong democratic movements,--Jackson the\r\nextrusion of the landed aristocracy, in favor of the masses, from their\r\npreferred position in our political life; Mr. Roosevelt, the similar\r\nextrusion of the business aristocracy, in favor of the masses from the\r\npreferred position they had gained in our political life. Like\r\nagitations of the political depths, finding expression in personalities\r\nas unusual as those of Jackson and Roosevelt, will give us from time to\r\ntime executives who may carry everything before them; but only\r\nemergencies like this and one other will make the President supreme.\r\n\r\nAnd even then it is easy to overstate the power of the Executive as it\r\nwas exercised by Mr. Roosevelt. The Colonel lived by picturesque\r\nexaggeration. If he went to South America it was to discover a river and\r\nfind animals that the eye of man never rested on before or since. He\r\nread more books than it was humanly possible to read and not become a\r\npallid bookworm. He pursued more interests than mere man can have. He\r\nexercised daily as only a pugilist exercises briefly when in training.\r\n\r\nHe had the gusto of the greatest amateur of all time and enjoyed the\r\nimmunity which is always granted to amateurs, that of never being\r\nmeasured by professional standards. When you might have been noting a\r\nweakness in one direction he was diverting you by an enormous exhibition\r\nof versatility in another. He had the capacity of seeming, and the\r\nsemblance was never penetrated. He seemed to bestride Washington like a\r\nColossus. Actually his rule was one long compromise with Aldrich and\r\nCannon, the business leaders of Congress, which he represented as a\r\nglorious triumph over them.\r\n\r\nOne man government was developed much further under Mr. Wilson than\r\nunder Mr. Roosevelt, Mr. Harding's predecessor entered office as the\r\nexpression of that movement toward a government based on numbers rather\r\nthan on wealth, which the Colonel had so imperfectly effected. There had\r\nbeen a reaction under Taft; there was a new determination under Wilson,\r\nand a new concentration on the executive.\r\n\r\nPoor, bookish, without the friendships in the business world which Mr.\r\nRoosevelt had had, having few contacts with life, Mr. Wilson embraced\r\nthe idea of putting business in its place passionately, where Mr.\r\nRoosevelt played with it as he played with everything else.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson was by temperament an autocrat. An illustration of how\r\npersonal was his government was his treatment of his enemies. His\r\nbitterness against Huntington Wilson, the Republican Ambassador to\r\nMexico, is well known. A year or two after the dispute was over,\r\nHuntington Wilson's son came up for examination to enter the Consular\r\nservice. He passed at the top of the list. President Wilson heard of his\r\nsuccess and directed that he should receive no appointment. He carried\r\nhis enmity to the second generation. The law which would have given\r\nyoung Mr. Wilson a place meant nothing under his personal government.\r\n\r\nAs Anatole France says of Robespierre, he \"_etait optimiste qui croyait\r\na la vertue_.\" Those who are \"optimists and believe in virtue,\" remarks\r\nthe French author, end by killing men. Wilson in a revolution would have\r\nconducted a Terror, as indeed during the war he did conduct a sort of\r\nlegal terror among pacifists and radicals. Roosevelt belonged to the\r\nother school in the conduct of affairs which Anatole France praises\r\nbecause it never forgets that men are \"_des mauvais singes_.\" In a\r\nrevolution Roosevelt would have cut off no more heads than would be\r\nnecessary to make a good show.\r\n\r\nMoreover, when Mr. Wilson entered office his party had been long out of\r\npower. Its leaders in the House and Senate were not firmly established.\r\nUnlike Cannon and Aldrich, of the Roosevelt day, they did not represent\r\nbusiness in the national legislature. They had no authority except the\r\npurely factitious authority created by the accident of seniority. They\r\nwere easily dominated from the White House.\r\n\r\nComing into power at such a moment, possessing such a temperament,\r\nrepresenting such a popular movement, Mr. Wilson readily became the most\r\nperfect example of the concentrated executive that we have yet had. But\r\neven his one man government was attacked from the outset. His\r\npersonality proved repellent. An intellectual is so unfamiliar an object\r\nin America as to seem almost a monstrosity, and his ascendancy would not\r\nhave lasted beyond two years if the war had not come.\r\n\r\nWar is the other great cause that leads to autocracy in popular\r\ngovernments. In times of common danger we revert to the herd with the\r\nsingle leadership. We resort to the only form of rule of which we have\r\nany experience in our daily lives, the only form in which the race has\r\nyet developed any lasting faith. From the time when war threatened, with\r\nthe invasion of Belgium, till the time when it ended with the armistice,\r\nMr. Wilson became what any President may become under like\r\ncircumstances, what Mr. Wilson's temperament especially fitted him to\r\nbecome--an absolute dictator.\r\n\r\nWhen we think of the powerful executive as the natural development of\r\nthe American system, imparting that unity to our government which the\r\nmakers of the Constitution in their zeal for checks and balances refused\r\nto give it, we are over-impressed by the phenomena of Roosevelt and\r\nWilson and do not make sufficient allowances for the conditions which\r\nmade their power inevitable. So impossible is it for authority to remain\r\npermanently in the hands of the executive that we are now witnessing its\r\nspontaneous movement away from the White House--toward, well for the\r\nmoment I should say, toward nowhere.\r\n\r\nA distinguished alienist tells me that the desire for power over your\r\nfellow man is an unmistakable sign of paranoia, not necessarily paranoia\r\namounting to insanity, but the same kind of paranoia which makes history\r\namusing. If that is true, then we are in an era of perfect sanity at\r\nWashington. No one, no one, in the White House, in the Capitol, in Wall\r\nStreet, the capitol of business, or back among the home folks, as far\r\nas I can learn, wants power--and responsibility.\r\n\r\nThe picture I have drawn, quoting a bright young observer at the capital\r\nof what happens when Business arrives in Washington is the picture of\r\nour whole present national political organization. \"A bunch of\r\ntall-hatted fat boys comes. The governmental nose is thrust out awaiting\r\nthe guiding hand. The guiding hand is put unostentatiously behind the\r\nback.\" It is the same when the organ of leading is extended from the\r\nWhite House for the hand of leadership at the Capitol, or, as happens,\r\nas often the organ of leading at the Capitol awaits the hand of\r\nleadership at the White House.\r\n\r\nPower is in transition and we do much inconsistent thinking about where\r\nit is and where it should be. We deliberately elected a weak executive,\r\nto retrieve the blessed days of McKinley, the old equilibrium and\r\nco-ordination of the equal and co-ordinate branches of our government.\r\nYet when things go badly in Congress, as they mostly do, the critics\r\nexclaim that the President should be firm and \"assert his authority\" on\r\nthe hill. Mr. Harding himself said, over and over again, \"This is no one\r\nman job at Washington.\" Yet we read that his face assumes a \"determined\r\nexpression\"--I have myself never seen it--and he sends for the leaders\r\nin Congress.\r\n\r\nWe haven't executive domination and we haven't anything in its place.\r\nWe voted to go back to the nineties, but we haven't got there. There is\r\nno Mark Hanna speaking for business and for party to make the system\r\nwork. We have the willessness of the blessed days in our National\r\nHeartbreak House, but we haven't the will somewhere else to act and\r\ndirect. Not even seven million majority is enough to bring back the\r\npast. In spite of \"landslides\" the course is always forward, and I use\r\n\"forward\" not in the necessarily optimistic sense of those who were once\r\nso sure of Progress.\r\n\r\nThe initiative, so far as there is any, has passed to Congress.\r\n\r\nAnd so far as I can see, it is likely to remain with Congress, until\r\nsome new turn of events brings us back the strong executive. For, after\r\nall, Congress chose Mr. Harding. The Senators picked him at Chicago.\r\nWith party bosses gone, they are about all that remains of the party,\r\nand there is no reason why they should not go on naming Presidents. And\r\nthe power of presidents will not rise much above its source.\r\n\r\nThe autocratic President goes inevitably the way its prototype the\r\nautocrat went. The loins that produce them are sufficiently fertile.\r\nPrimogeniture brought forth feeble kings. The nominating system called\r\non for a great man every four years yields many feeble ones. There will\r\nbe many Hardings to one Roosevelt or Wilson. Party government which\r\nmight reinforce a feeble president is weak. Government by business has\r\nlost its confidence and authority. The great discovery of the first\r\ndecade of this century for making this government of ours work is\r\nalready in the discard.\r\n\r\nSo at a critical moment when government by Progress and government by\r\nbusiness have broken down, government by one man at Washington has also\r\ngone. The war made the autocratic executive in the person of Mr. Wilson\r\nintolerable. It also destroyed the basis for national concentration upon\r\nthe executive.\r\n\r\nWe need a new picture in our heads of what government should be, what\r\nits limits should be when it faces such vital problems as interfering\r\nwith God's time, and where its authority should center. We have none.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nLOOKING FOR ULTIMATE WISDOM--IN THE BOSOM OF THERESE\r\n\r\n\r\nWe now pursue further the search for authority. We shall surely find\r\n\"divine right\" somewhere, now that business has lost it. Someone\r\ncertainly has the final word about the pictures to put in our heads. Ah!\r\nthere is the public, the imputation of a miraculous quality to whose\r\nopinion has a curious history.\r\n\r\nEverybody agrees that we owe most of the pleasant illusions upon which\r\nthis democracy of ours is based to Rousseau. This Swiss sentimentalist\r\nabout humanity, whose ideas have so profoundly affected the history of\r\nthe last century and a half, was a convinced believer that perfect good\r\nsense resided in the bosom of the natural man, the man \"born free and\r\nequal\" of our Declaration of Independence.\r\n\r\nRousseau could find this simple wisdom which was his delight in the most\r\nunexpected places. He describes his mistress Therese with whom he lived\r\nmany happy years: \"Her mind is what nature has made it; cultivation is\r\nwithout effect. I do not blush to avow that she has never known how to\r\nread, although she writes passably. When I went to live in the Rue Neuve\r\ndes Petits Champs I had opposite my windows a clock face on which I\r\ntried during several months to teach her to tell time. She can scarcely\r\ndo it even now. She has never known in their order the twelve months of\r\nthe year, and she does not know a single figure in spite of all the\r\npains I have taken to explain them to her.... But this person, so\r\nlimited and, if you wish, so stupid, has excellent judgment on occasions\r\nof difficulty. Often in my troubles she has seen what I did not see\r\nmyself; she has given me the best advice to follow. She has pulled me\r\nout of dangers into which I rushed blindly.... The heart of my Therese\r\nwas the heart of an angel. (_Le coeur de ma Therese etait celui d'un\r\nange._)\"\r\n\r\nIt would be amusing to trace our belief in the good sense of man, in the\r\nwisdom and justice of public opinion, back to a philosopher's delight in\r\na female moron; but that would be too great a paradox for a serious\r\ndiscussion of today's crisis in popular government. The truth probably\r\nis that Rousseau reached _a priori_ the conclusions about the sound\r\nsense of the simple and natural man that captivated a society so simple\r\nand natural as our own was in the eighteenth century, and then stumbled\r\nupon such convincing evidence in the person of Therese that he had to\r\nkeep it by him all the rest of his days.\r\n\r\nAnd where after all has there been found any better evidence for our\r\nbelief in the soundness and justice of public opinion than was furnished\r\nby the unlettered and unteachable Therese, who had \"le coeur d'un ange\"\r\nand \"devant les dames du plus haut rang, devant les grands et les\r\nprinces, ses sentiments, son bon sens, ses reponses et sa conduite lui\r\nout tire l'estime universelle\"?\r\n\r\nTo accept the doctrine of the rightness of public opinion you must\r\nbelieve that there resides in every man, even in the most unpromising\r\nman, of the mental level of Therese, \"si bornee et, si l'on veut, si\r\nstupide,\" the capacity to be, like her, \"d'un conseil excellent dans les\r\noccasions difficiles.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of the rightness of public opinion, however, never required\r\nproof. It was a political necessity. The world at the time when modern\r\ndemocracies had their birth accepted government only because it rested\r\nupon divine right. The government of men by mere men has always been\r\nintolerable.\r\n\r\nThe new democracies which were to take the place of the old kingdoms had\r\nto have some sanction other than the suffrages of the people. Room had\r\nto be found in them somewhere for divine right. Those who established\r\nthe modern system could never have sold self-government to the people as\r\nself government. There had to be some miracle about it, something\r\nsupernatural, like that marvel which turned a mere man into a King and\r\ngave him that power of healing by touch which was exercised in Galilee,\r\nso that the laying on of his hands cured the king's evil.\r\n\r\nThe miracle was accomplished somewhere in the process through which your\r\nopinion and my opinion and Therese's opinion became public opinion. Just\r\nas the anointment or the coronation turned a mere human being by a\r\nmiracle into the chosen of God ruling by divine right, so by some\r\ntransmutation which does not take place before the eyes, mere human\r\nopinion becomes itself the choice of God, ruling by divine right.\r\n\r\nIf you doubt that the founders of modern democracy had to carry over\r\ninto their systems the old illusions about divine right, read what\r\nThomas Jefferson, more or less a free thinker, quoted by Mr. Walter\r\nLippmann in his _Public Opinion_, has to say about the divine basis for\r\npopular government: \"Those who labor in the earth are the chosen people\r\nof God, if ever He had a chosen people, whose breasts He has made His\r\npeculiar deposit for substantial and genuine virtue. It is the focus in\r\nwhich He keeps alive that sacred fire which might otherwise escape from\r\nthe earth.\"\r\n\r\nThat \"deposit for substantial and genuine virtue\" was public opinion.\r\nNothing was lost of the sanctions of monarchic government when we\r\nchanged to popular government.\r\n\r\nSince the days of Jefferson we have ceased to be an agricultural people\r\nand we can no longer derive the authority of our government from the\r\nRousseauist notion that the farmer, being near to nature, thrusting his\r\nhands into the soil, was the choice of God and ruled by a kind of divine\r\nright. But \"aucune religion n'est jamais morte, ni ne mourra jamais.\"\r\n\r\nLet us examine the doctrine of Jefferson. Public opinion ruled by divine\r\nright because, in this country and in his day, it was the opinion of\r\nfarmers, who were \"the chosen people of God whose breasts He has made\r\nthe peculiar deposit for substantial and genuine virtue.\"\r\n\r\nWhen we ceased to be a nation of farmers did we abandon the basis of our\r\ngovernment in divine right? Not in the least. We broadened our ground to\r\ncover the added elements of the community and went along further with\r\nRousseau than Jefferson had need to do; we said that the breasts of all\r\nmen \"He has made the peculiar deposit for substantial and genuine\r\nvirtue.\" The art of uncovering their substantial and genuine virtue,\r\nthis quality in Therese which drew down upon her universal esteem for\r\nher good sense and her sound sentiments, is the art of arriving at\r\npublic opinion.\r\n\r\nThe legend of public opinion is thus accounted for; first, you will\r\nobserve, it was politically necessary to assert the inspiration of\r\npublic opinion, for divine right had to reside somewhere. Second, in a\r\ndemocracy the press and public men had to flatter the mass of voters and\r\nreaders by declaring on every possible occasion that wisdom reposed in\r\ntheir breasts. And third, the public mind differed so from the ordinary\r\nthinking mind that, to put its conclusions in a favorable light, men had\r\nto assume some supernatural quality, some divine \"deposit for\r\nsubstantial and genuine virtue.\"\r\n\r\nThe public did not think, in the ordinary sense, yet its decisions were\r\nmore right than the carefully elaborated decisions of those who did\r\nthink; the wonder of Therese over again, who \"si bornee et si stupide\"\r\ngave such excellent advice on difficult occasions. No processes by which\r\nresults were reached could be perceived by the trained mind. The mystery\r\nof the public mind was as great as the mystery of intuitions is to the\r\nlogical or the mystery of poetry is to the prosaic. Clearly, a miracle;\r\nclearly, a deposit for substantial and genuine virtue.\r\n\r\nWhen modern democracy got its start, kings by their folly had shaken\r\nfaith in their divine right. In a similar way at this moment, public\r\nopinion by its excesses has made men question whether any \"deposit for\r\nsubstantial and genuine virtue\" has been placed in human breasts upon\r\nwhich states may rely for justice and wisdom.\r\n\r\nWalter Lippmann's book, _Public Opinion_, with its destructive analysis\r\nof the public mind, is a symptom of those doubts with which the war has\r\nleft us. The years from 1914 on furnished the most perfect exhibition of\r\npublic opinion and its workings that the world has ever seen. You saw on\r\na grand scale its miraculous capacity for instant formation and, if you\r\nare sufficiently detached now, you look back and doubt whether what was\r\nrevealed was a \"deposit for substantial and genuine virtue.\"\r\n\r\nBoth sides to the conflict resembled nothing so much as prehistoric\r\ntribes meeting accidentally in the night and, precipitated into panic,\r\nfighting in the belief that each was being attacked by the other.\r\n\r\nPublic opinion in France and England felt that the war was defensive.\r\nPublic opinion in Germany was equally sure that Germany was only\r\ndefending herself. Either the German Therese or the French Therese and\r\nthe English Therese and the American Therese must have been wrong. The\r\nfight could not have been defensive on both sides. And if Therese is\r\never so wrong as this, the whole case of the divine rightness of public\r\nopinion falls.\r\n\r\nAnd not only do we know that some Therese, perhaps all the Thereses,\r\nmade a mistake in this instance, but we have come to feel that whenever\r\ndanger arises Therese is inevitably wrong; her mind, such as it is,\r\ncloses up and she fails to show those _sentiments_ and that _bon sens_\r\nwhich drew down the applause of the princes and the persons _du haut\r\nrang_ who have been praising the deposit of virtue that she carries in\r\nher breast.\r\n\r\nWe have watched the course of Therese confronted by other and smaller\r\nfears since the close of the war, and we have reached the conclusion\r\nthat Therese always reacts a certain way. In that large range of\r\nsituations which may be artfully presented to her simple mind as perils\r\nshe is no longer _d'un conseil excellent_; her heart _d'un ange_\r\nhardens; she abandons her babies quite unfeelingly at the hospital of\r\nthe _Nouveaux Nes_.\r\n\r\nTherefore you do not reach the \"deposit for virtue\" by simply employing\r\nan intelligence unencumbered by mental processes. You must at least\r\nassure that intelligence against fear, a serious limitation upon the\r\ndoctrine of an infallible public opinion.\r\n\r\nStudents of public opinion will for a long time go back to the period of\r\nthe war for their materials. Opinion was then unmistakable. The methods\r\nby which it was formed were clear. In times of great peril men throw off\r\ntheir polite disguises and are frank; so too are institutions.\r\n\r\nThe making of opinion became an official function in which we all\r\nco-operated. We bound ourselves voluntarily not to publish and not to\r\nregard any information inconsistent with the state of mind which it was\r\ndeemed expedient to create and maintain. We probably always in the\r\nforming of opinion tacitly impose voluntary censorships, but they are\r\nso habitual, so unconscious, so covered with traditional hypocrisy, that\r\nit is difficult to bring them into the light.\r\n\r\nConscious self-deception to the good end of keeping ourselves united and\r\ndetermined was during the war a great virtue. Playing upon prejudice,\r\nrousing the depths of the primitive mind in man, was a laudable act of\r\npatriotism.\r\n\r\nWhat happened then was only an exaggeration of what happens all the\r\ntime, for war makes no new contributions to the art of self-government.\r\nIn war we merely throw off the restraints of peace and impose others\r\nwhich operate in the reverse direction. In peace we are shamefaced about\r\ndirect killing; in war we brag of it. In peace we are shamefaced about\r\nmanufacturing public opinion; in war it is our patriotic duty.\r\n\r\nNo, war has made us rather doubtful about Therese. After all Rousseau\r\nwas a prejudiced witness. When you take to your bosom a lady who cannot\r\nlearn to tell time by the clock, you have to make out a case for her--or\r\nfor yourself. When like Jefferson and his successors you take to your\r\nbosom the public, you have to make out a case for it, for the deposit\r\nfor substantial and genuine virtue that you rely upon.\r\n\r\nThe war revealed at once the immense power and the immense dangers of\r\npublic opinion when its full force is aroused and one hundred million\r\npeople come to think--thinking is not the word--to feel, as one man.\r\nMinorities, the great corrective in democracy, disappeared. They had\r\ntheir choice of going to jail or bowing to the general will.\r\n\r\nFew realized this alternative, so irresistible was the mob impulse,\r\nawakened by the sense of common danger, even to individuals ordinarily\r\ncapable of maintaining their detachment. The primitive instinct of\r\nself-preservation subdued all capacity for independent thinking, so that\r\none who has ordinarily the habit of making up his own mind, a most\r\ndifficult habit to maintain in modern society, can not look back on\r\nhimself during the war without a sense of shame. Romain Rolland, in\r\n_Clerambeault_, pictures the devastating effect of public opinion at its\r\nmightiest upon the individual conscience.\r\n\r\nThe mechanism by which this state of mind was created was unconcealed.\r\nThe government reserved to itself the right to suppress truth or to put\r\nout untruth for the common good. Private organizations of endless number\r\nco-operated to this laudable end. The press submitted itself to a\r\nvoluntary censorship, passing the responsibility for what it printed\r\nover to society whose general end of maintaining unity for the real or\r\nimaginary necessities of self-defense it served. A lynch law of opinion\r\nwas established by common consent.\r\n\r\nWhat went on during the war goes on, though less openly and less\r\nformidably, all of the time. Everyone realizes the immense power of\r\npublic opinion. Many seek to direct its formation. The government\r\nconducts all of the time a vast propaganda, always with a certain favor\r\nof the press.\r\n\r\nWe submit always to a certain voluntary censorship, not so conscious as\r\nthat which existed during the war but none the less real. We receive\r\nupon the whole the information which is good for us to receive. We are\r\nall a little afraid of public opinion, its tyranny, its excesses, its\r\nblind tendencies. We do not find it, as Jefferson thought we should, a\r\n\"deposit for substantial and genuine virtue,\" and we are all more or\r\nless consciously trying to make it one; that is the process of rendering\r\nmodern democracy workable; but we may not be all unprejudiced about what\r\nthe deposit should be or scrupulous about the means of improving it.\r\n\r\nThe part which the press plays in this process is peculiar. When editors\r\nor correspondents meet together the speaker addresses them invariably\r\nas, \"You makers of public opinion,\" but the last responsibility which\r\njournalism cares to assume is the making of public opinion.\r\n\r\nThis disinclination began with the exclusion of the editor's opinion\r\nfrom the news columns. Gradually, it extended to the exclusion of his\r\nopinion from the editorial pages and finally to its exclusion from his\r\nown mind. I am speaking only of tendencies, not of their complete\r\nrealization, for there are notable exceptions among the greater dailies\r\nof this country.\r\n\r\nThis movement is at its strongest in the nation's capital, for official\r\nWashington likes to live in an intellectual vacuum, and journalism\r\nstrives successfully to please. With the world crashing about his ears\r\nthe editor of the _Star_, the best newspaper in the capital, finds this\r\nto say:\r\n\r\n\"The Crown Prince of Japan and the Prince of Wales are young men\r\ndestined for great parts in world affairs. They are now qualifying for\r\ntheir work.\r\n\r\n\"Last year the former took his first look around in the occidental\r\nworld. He was everywhere most cordially received, and returned home\r\ninformed and refreshed by what he had seen and heard. His vision,\r\nnecessarily, was considerably enlarged.\r\n\r\n\"The latter is now taking his first look around in the oriental world.\r\nIn a few days he will land in Japan and be the guest of the country for\r\na month. The arrangements for his entertainment are elaborate, and\r\ninsure him with a delightful and a profitable visit. That he will return\r\nhome informed and refreshed by his travels is certain.\r\n\r\n\"The war has produced a new world, which in many things must be ordered\r\nin new ways. Young men for action; and here are two young men who when\r\nthey get into action and into their stride will be prominent and\r\nimportant in the world picture.\"\r\n\r\nBut if a newspaper rigidly excludes its editor's opinions from its\r\ncolumns, it is singularly hospitable to all other opinions. The\r\nPresident twice a week may edit the papers of the entire country, or Mr.\r\nHughes may do it every day,--or Mr. Hoover or Mr. Daugherty for that\r\nmatter, even having extended to him the privilege of anonymity which\r\neditors used to keep to themselves, as a device for giving force and\r\neffect to their ideas.\r\n\r\nThe President \"sees the press\" Tuesdays and Fridays, volunteering\r\ninformation or answering questions. Mr. Hughes holds daily receptions.\r\nEveryone else big enough to break into print follows the same practice.\r\n\r\nA curious modesty prevails. Every public man loves to see his name in\r\nthe newspapers, yet no one of them at these conferences will assume\r\nresponsibility for what he says. All of them resort to the editorial\r\npractice of anonymity.\r\n\r\nThe rule is that the correspondents must not quote Mr. Harding or Mr.\r\nHughes or anyone else.\r\n\r\nThey must not write \"Mr. Harding said\" or \"Mr. Hughes said.\" They must\r\nprint what Mr. Harding or Mr. Hughes said as a fact; that is, they must\r\nput the authority of their paper behind it or, if they doubt, they must\r\nassign for it \"a high authority,\" thus putting the authority of their\r\npaper behind it at one remove.\r\n\r\nThe editor, having excluded his own opinions from his news columns,\r\nopens his news columns to Mr. Harding's or Mr. Hughes's opinions, giving\r\nno guide to the reader whether he is printing fact or opinion, and, if\r\nobviously opinion, as to whose opinion it is.\r\n\r\nThe rule is, nothing but news in the news column. The news is, \"Mr.\r\nHarding said so and so.\" But what is printed is, \"so and so is a fact\"\r\nor, \"so and so the paper believes on unimpeachable authority to be a\r\nfact.\"\r\n\r\nThis official control of news columns goes further. Not only, according\r\nto the rules, must the source of certain information be regarded as a\r\nconfidence but essential facts themselves may not be disclosed.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable uses of the news columns to create public\r\nopinion was that of Attorney-General Palmer whose several announcements\r\nof red revolution in the United States startled the country two years\r\nago. A series of sensational plots was described. Very soon every\r\nintelligent correspondent felt sure that Mr. Palmer was largely\r\npropaganding. But to say so would have been to violate that law against\r\nthe expression of opinion in news columns, so essential to the truth and\r\naccuracy of our press. Moreover, if my memory is correct, somewhere in\r\nthe series the Attorney-General told the press, in confidence, that he\r\nwas putting forth his stories of revolution for a purpose. But one does\r\nnot print confidences.\r\n\r\nIn this case the news was that Attorney-General Palmer was issuing\r\nstories of discovered revolutionary plots to combat a certain radicalism\r\nin the labor movement. As printed it was that Attorney-General Palmer\r\nsaid--he permitted his name to be used--that he had discovered\r\nrevolutionary plots.\r\n\r\nBut the uncritical reader does not ask himself whether the\r\nAttorney-General may not be lying. And even if he were inclined to do so\r\nthe headline throws him off his guard, for in the limited space\r\navailable for captions, mere assertions tend to become facts. As it\r\nreached the reader's mind the fact that Mr. Palmer was avowedly issuing\r\npropaganda became the fact that evidences of a great Bolshevist plot\r\nagainst our institutions were being discovered almost daily.\r\n\r\nThere are disadvantages in the official editing of news columns. The\r\nofficial does not always escape by shifting responsibility to the\r\neditor. The British during the Washington Conference introduced an\r\nimprovement. They put out propaganda which had no authority at all. This\r\nthe newspapers either had to leave out or to print on their own\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nLord Riddell had \"no official connection with the British delegation.\"\r\nHe had moreover a perfect alibi. There was Sir Arthur Willert, the\r\nofficial spokesman, who knew nothing and told nothing. Riddell's was a\r\nprivate enterprise. He was just a journalist willing to share with\r\nother journalists what information he collected. Just a journalist?\r\nWell, it was true that \"Lloyd George had asked him to stay on\" when he\r\nwas on the point of departing. But that was a confidence and under the\r\nrules the press does not print confidences.\r\n\r\nRiddell's disclosures were perfectly timed. The best of them came out in\r\nthe morning when afternoon correspondents must either rush them through\r\nas facts--they could not even say \"on the highest authority\"--or explain\r\nto their editors why they had been beaten by their rivals.\r\n\r\nRiddell is one of the British Premier's intimates. A lawyer turned\r\nnewspaper proprietor, he brings out the _News of the World_, a London\r\nSunday publication, sensational and trashy, of which 3,500,000 copies or\r\nsome such preposterous number are sold. He started in during the war as\r\na spokesman for the British Premier. He kept it up at the Paris\r\nConference. And at Washington he scored his greatest success.\r\n\r\nWhat he had said at his seance was, \"Now, of course, I don't know, but I\r\nimagine the Conference will do thus and so.\" He was delightfully\r\nirresponsible, having no official connection. He could leak when he had\r\nanything to leak. He could guess, near the truth or far from the truth,\r\nfor, after all, he was only \"imagining.\" He joked. He indulged in\r\nbuffoonery. He put out propaganda when he wished. But he mixed enough\r\ntruth with it all so that the correspondents thronged his meetings. So\r\nfar as there was publicity at the Conference, he was that publicity.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing of the great man about him. He did not pretend to be a\r\nstatesman. He did not take himself seriously. He reached out for his\r\npublic in the same undress way that he does in his Sunday newspaper.\r\n\"Ex-tra-ter-ri-to-ri-al-ity,\" he would say, \"that's a long word. I never\r\nheard it before I came here.\" \"Kow Loon, where is the place anyway?\" You\r\nfelt that for the British Empire these places and issues were\r\ntrivialities.\r\n\r\nHe was familiar, quite inoffensively. \"The highly intelligent seal of\r\nthe Associated Press--was it Mr. Hood here?--must have been under the\r\ntable in the committee room when he got this story. He knows more about\r\nit than I do.\" He was humorous. \"The Conference means to do good and,\r\naccording to the well known rule--what is it?--Oh, yes! 'Cast your bread\r\nupon the waters'--and by--er--a certain repercussion we all expect to\r\nbenefit.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not said cynically. It was no effort to be funny. It was natural\r\nand inevitable. Lord Riddell himself did good to the press, and by a\r\ncertain repercussion the British Empire benefited. It was a publicity\r\n\"stunt\" that has never been equalled. Never before did one man have\r\nworld opinion so much in his hands. Only Riddell's personality, his\r\nfriendliness, his apparent disingenuousness, his trifling, enabled him\r\nto exercise his power--these and the immense demand for publicity, where\r\naside from his there was little.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LORD RIDDELL]\r\n\r\nThe hospitality of news columns is not extended to officials alone. A\r\nvast industry second only to that of news collecting has been built up\r\nfor the purpose of conveying opinions to readers in the guise of news.\r\nIts constant growth is a proof of its success.\r\n\r\nThe reason for the opening of newspaper columns to it is commercial. A\r\nvariety of interests and opinions tends to reflect itself, as at Paris,\r\nin a multiplicity of newspapers. The American newspaper proprietor has\r\navoided competition by steadily restricting the expression of opinion\r\nfirst in the news columns and then on the editorial page, so as to\r\noffend as few of his readers as possible, and then opening his news\r\ncolumns to opinions which he could not approve on his editorial page,\r\nprovided they could be disguised as news.\r\n\r\nBut the faults of public opinion as a governing force do not spring from\r\nan uncritical journalism, conducted in haste and under compulsion to be\r\ninteresting rather than adequate, too little edited by its editors and\r\ntoo much edited by others. The trouble with Therese is her lack of mind.\r\nIn spite of her good sense and habit of giving excellent advice she is\r\n_bornee et, si l'on veut, stupide_. We do not find in her what\r\nRousseau was convinced he found in her, \"a deposit for substantial and\r\ngenuine virtue.\"\r\n\r\nWe know more about the public mind today than Jefferson did when he\r\nwrote about it. We have studied the psychology of the mob and we know\r\nthat the psychology of the public is not different. Like the mind of\r\nTherese, the public mind has never grown up; with this difference, that\r\nthe mind of Therese never could grow up and the mind of the public, we\r\nhope, will.\r\n\r\nThe public mind is young. Only for a very few years in the history of\r\nthe race has there been any such thing as a conscious public. Jefferson\r\nwas right in thinking that its mind was not the sum of the individual\r\nminds: nevertheless, it is not a \"deposit for virtue.\" Men act in a mass\r\nquite differently from the way they act as individuals, only\r\nunfortunately there is not any necessary divine rightness about the way\r\nthey act: there is often divine wrongness.\r\n\r\nWe have built up the machinery for converting one hundred million widely\r\nscattered people into a public, for giving it a sense of community, but\r\nwe have not at an equal rate built up a public mind.\r\n\r\nWith the telegraph, the wireless telephone, the standardized press, the\r\ninstant bulletin going everywhere, we can stir the whole people as a\r\nmob, make it revert into a frightened herd, but we can not make it\r\nthink.\r\n\r\nThe public is too young to have a developed mind. In a hundred\r\ngenerations it may have one.\r\n\r\nThis experiment in democracy is conducted in the faith that it will have\r\none, that the mass of mankind may be lifted up so that there will be as\r\nmuch freedom of thinking in a democratic society as there once was in an\r\naristocratic society. It is the bravest experiment in history but its\r\nsuccess is afar off, Rousseau's belief in Therese to the contrary\r\nnotwithstanding.\r\n\r\nIn the present state of undeveloped mind and overdeveloped machinery of\r\ncommunication public opinion is a great negative force. It does nothing\r\nconstructive. It can only be thoroughly aroused by a suggestion of\r\ndanger. Statesmen are both afraid of it and despise it, and between\r\ncontempt and fear are reduced to temporary expedients.\r\n\r\nSo that when we speak of government by public opinion we speak of\r\nsomething that has been as badly shaken as government by business, or\r\nexecutive government or party government or any one of the various\r\ngovernments upon which we once relied. The war has made it almost as\r\nintolerable as it made autocracy, as practiced by Mr. Wilson.\r\n\r\nShall official Washington turn to public opinion as its guide? Official\r\nWashington is busy all the time with all the arts it used during the war\r\nshaping public opinion to its own ends. It must have been hard for a\r\nking's minister to believe in the divinity of the monarch he was\r\ngulling. And at any moment public opinion may belong to Mr. Hearst.\r\n\r\nThis new ruler by divine right is not going to be so easy to dethrone as\r\nhis predecessors. No new Rousseau will discern a new Therese. Mr. Walter\r\nLippmann would set up in its place the expert by divine right, but the\r\nexpert is a palpable pretender.\r\n\r\nThe best hope for the present moment is perhaps to divide the public.\r\nMinorities based on interest will at least be constructive. Organized,\r\nthey may offer an effective resistance. Out of them may come a\r\ndevelopment of the public mind.\r\n\r\nIf Jefferson were writing today he might say that the farm bloc\r\ncontained the \"deposit for substantial and genuine virtue.\" At any rate\r\nit tills the soil.\r\n\r\nIf we break up the threatening mass which the war has taught us to fear,\r\nthere might be organized a thinkers' bloc. Thinking in this country\r\ncertainly needs a bloc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nSHALL WE FIND OUR SALVATION SITTING, LIKE MR. MELLON, ON A PILE OF\r\nDOLLARS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe conditions which face Mr. Harding are like those which face the\r\nadministrator of a corporation left by its old head and creator to the\r\ndirection of an incompetent son. The young man is the nominal master of\r\nthe business. He lacks confidence in himself and what is worse still his\r\nwife and mother lack confidence in him. They have fortified him with a\r\nbrother-in-law as a right hand man. His brother-in-law knows little of\r\nthe business and can never forget that he is the creature of his sister\r\nand her mother-in-law.\r\n\r\nThe administrator of this corporation wishes to obtain a decision upon\r\npolicy. The proprieties require him to consult its nominal head. The\r\nyoung man, unsure of himself, must talk it over with the mentor whom his\r\nwife and mother have provided. He in turn proves no final authority but\r\nmust discuss the question with his sister. Ultimately the widow who owns\r\nmost of the stock must be approached. She hires others to run the\r\nproperty, wonders why they do not run it. The very fact that the others\r\ncould reach no decision makes her cautious about reaching one herself.\r\nThe administrator goes vainly about this circle seeking for a \"yes\" or\r\n\"no.\"\r\n\r\nThe government was simple when the public had faith in the social\r\npurposes of business and public opinion did not differ greatly from\r\nbusiness opinion. Parties reflected the will of business. Authority was\r\ncentered. Whether you said it resided in parties or in business or in\r\npublic opinion made little difference. There was substantial agreement.\r\nA \"yes\" or \"no\" was easy.\r\n\r\nSuppose Mr. Harding should be in doubt, as he is so often--today. He\r\nasks himself what is party opinion, what is business opinion, what is\r\npublic opinion, or what is the opinion of some powerful minority which\r\nmay turn an election against him.\r\n\r\nHis party has no opinion; it exists by virtue of its capacity to think\r\nnothing about everything and thus avoid dissensions. Business is of two\r\nminds and is moreover afraid of the public. It will assume no\r\nresponsibility. Public opinion, what is it? Mr. Hearst's newspapers? Or\r\nthe rest of the press? Or the product of the propaganda conducted from\r\nWashington? Or something that Mr. Harding may create himself if he will?\r\nMinority opinion is definite, but is it safe? Where is authority?\r\n\r\nA return to those happy days when authority did center somewhere, when\r\nin conducting the business you did not have to run around the whole\r\ncircle seeing the young man, his wife, his brother-in-law, and the widow\r\nwho inherited the property, is our constant dream. Let us get back to\r\nparty government, exclaimed Mr. Harding; so the nation voted to do so,\r\nonly to find there were neither parties nor party government.\r\n\r\nLet us, then, it is suggested, found some new party that will \"stand for\r\nsomething,\" that will synthesize in one social aim, the common element\r\nin the aims of various interests into which the country is divided. But\r\nno one can point out the common basis, the principle which the new party\r\nshall advocate.\r\n\r\nLet us then have a better informed public opinion. Mr. Walter Lippmann\r\nin his new book upon the subject, despairing of the press, would put the\r\nmaking of public opinion in the hands of experts, collecting the truth\r\nwith the impartiality of science.\r\n\r\nWe seek unity as perhaps the builders of Babel sought it after the\r\nconfusion of tongues fell upon them.\r\n\r\nOne favorite hope of attaining it is through a new synthesis of business\r\nand politics. Government by business had worked. Let us return to Eden.\r\nLet us elect a business man President. One may substitute for President\r\nin this last sentence Governor or Mayor or Senator or Congressman, for\r\nwhatever the office is, this recipe is always suggested.\r\n\r\nThus, so it is piously hoped, we may get back to those good old times\r\nbefore we builded for ourselves this Babel, a government that was\r\nindependent of business, parties that were independent of everything\r\nunder the sun, voters that were independent of parties, a press that was\r\nindependent, a propaganda that was independent, and blocs that knew no\r\nrule but their own.\r\n\r\nElect the business man to office, so it is felt, and you will have an\r\nimportant synthesis, an old and tried one, one that worked, business and\r\npolitics. You will do more. You will import into public life all that\r\nwonderful efficiency which we read about in the _American Magazine_,\r\nthat will to power, that habit of getting things done, that instant\r\ncapacity for decision which we romantically associate with commercial\r\nlife. All this is in the minds of those who urge this method of\r\nachieving unity.\r\n\r\nWe have no greater national illusion than the business man illusion. In\r\nany other country a business man is just a business man; in America he\r\nis a demigod. Golden words, as Mark Twain said, flow out of his mouth.\r\nHe performs miracles. He has erected a great industry and amassed a\r\nlarge fortune. Therefore he would make a great public official. We never\r\nthink of him as merely a specialist having a narrow aptitude for heaping\r\nup money.\r\n\r\nThe reasoning about the business man is this. Success, real success,\r\ncomes to the jack of all trades, a major premise handed down from\r\npioneer days. \"A\" is a real success, for he has made several millions.\r\nTherefore \"A\" is a jack of all trades. Therefore he would be as great a\r\nPresident as he is a shoe button manufacturer.\r\n\r\nWe owe the business-man illusion to the pioneers. In a few years they\r\nsubjected a continent to our uses. They accumulated for themselves\r\nwealth such as the world had never seen. The nation does not think of\r\nthem as the luckiest of a generation facing such virgin resources as\r\nexisted on no other continent, at a moment when means of transportation\r\nsuch as the world had never seen before, and machinery for manufacture\r\nwithout parallel were in their hands. The marvelous element was not the\r\nopportunity but the men.\r\n\r\nOne day they were telegraphers, day laborers, railroad section hands and\r\nthe next they were colossal figures of American enterprise. As their\r\nlike existed nowhere else they became the American type. They\r\nestablished the tradition of American business.\r\n\r\nIt has been a tradition profitable to keep alive. The men who by luck,\r\nby picking other men's wits, or by the possession of a special talent,\r\nuseful only in a society like our own, grow vastly rich, love to read\r\nhow wonderful they are. For their delectation a journalism has grown up\r\nto celebrate the epic of their marvelous industry, resourcefulness,\r\nefficiency, their god-like insight into the hearts of men; whose praises\r\nthey pay for liberally in the disposition of advertising. Young men who\r\nwould be great read this journalism diligently looking for the secret of\r\nsuccess. Reading it they resolve not to keep their minds upon five\r\no'clock when the closing whistle blows but to become rich by industry\r\nand thrift like its great exemplars; who profit by it not only in having\r\ntheir own praises sung but in getting more work out of their servants.\r\n\r\nSo much virtue rests upon the business-man illusion that no one would\r\nlay an impious finger on it. I merely analyze it to exhibit the contents\r\nof our minds when we say \"elect a business man President,\" and to\r\npresent the picture of a demigod out of the _American Magazine_ in the\r\nWhite House, and a new synthesis of business and politics.\r\n\r\nMoreover, we let ourselves be misled by the habit of speaking of the\r\n\"public business\" and accepting without examination the analogy which\r\nthe word suggests. We say to ourselves, \"Well, since government is a\r\nbusiness, the proper person to be in charge of it is a business man.\"\r\nBut it is not business in any exact sense of the word. If the product of\r\nthe operation were a mere bookkeeping profit or even mere bookkeeping\r\neconomies then it might properly be called a business. But that which\r\nbusiness efficiency in office, if it could really be obtained, might do\r\nwell, is the least part of self-government, whose main end must for a\r\nlong time be the steady building up of the democratic ideal.\r\n\r\nBut the electing of business men to office does not build up this ideal.\r\nOn the contrary it is a confession of failure in democracy, an admission\r\nthat public life in it does not develop men fit for its tasks, that for\r\ncapacity it is necessary to seek in another world and summon an\r\noutsider; establish a sort of receivership in self-government.\r\n\r\nAnd it is a blind sort of receivership. We know little about business\r\nmen except the noisy disclosures of their press agents. \"X\" has made a\r\nmillion dollars. If we no longer say, as in the days of Mark Twain, that\r\ngolden words flow from his mouth, we accept his wealth as proof positive\r\nof his extraordinary capacity for affairs. There is no going behind the\r\nfact of his vast accumulation, for business is conducted in secret. The\r\nlaw recognizes that it has to be, keeping in confidence facts disclosed\r\nthrough income tax returns.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider a successful business man for office no allowance can\r\nbe made for the fact that the intelligence responsible for his success\r\nmay not have been his as head of a successful organization. In no way\r\nmay it be asked and answered whether all the original force which was in\r\nhim may not have been spent before he is suggested for office. Senator\r\nKnox was an instance of spent force, his energy and ambition being gone\r\nwhen he entered public life.\r\n\r\nLuck may explain a commercial career and you cannot elect luck to\r\noffice. Special talents which are valuable in making money may be out of\r\nplace in political life.\r\n\r\nMoreover commercial success in America has been easier than anywhere\r\nelse in the world. Opportunities are numerous with the result that\r\ncompetition has not been keen. Nothing has been so over praised or so\r\nblindly praised as business success in this country. We may occasionally\r\nelect men in public life to office upon false reputations, as we did\r\nVice-President Coolidge, crediting him with a firmness toward the Boston\r\npolice strikers which had been shown by a subordinate in his absence.\r\nBut at least the acts of officials are subject to popular scrutiny.\r\nBehind success in business we may not look.\r\n\r\nTake the case of a Middle Western corporation. Three quarters of its\r\nprofits came from a subsidiary. The history of the subsidiary is this:\r\nThe corporation came into possession of certain mineral lands through\r\nthe foreclosure of a mortgage. A company developing a product from the\r\nmineral failed. The head of the corporation acquiring the property by\r\nforeclosure thought this product of little value. A subordinate felt\r\nthat it could by a change of name and judicious advertising be widely\r\nsold. He had great difficulty in persuading his employer but in the end\r\nobtained the money to make his experiment, whose results fully justified\r\nhis judgment. The public seeking a business man for office would look no\r\nfurther than at the success of the corporation, which would be proof\r\nsufficient of the great talents of its head. Electing him they would not\r\nobtain for public service the mind which made the money, even if it be\r\nagreed that the talent for making money is a talent for public service.\r\n\r\nAnd this case: A great Eastern trust acquired possession of a piece of\r\nproperty in this way: It uses a mineral product not much found in this\r\ncountry. Some Westerners had a deposit. They went to the Eastern trust,\r\nwhich encouraged them and loaned them $10,000 for its development. They\r\nthen found that the trust was the only market for the mineral and that\r\nit had no intention to buy. Ultimately this deposit passed to the trust\r\nby foreclosure of the $10,000 mortgage. The trust thus obtaining\r\nownership, began mining and in the first year cleared $500,000 on its\r\n$10,000 investment. The transaction in this instance was not the work of\r\na subordinate; it revealed, however, a peculiar talent in the head of\r\nthe corporation that would not be serviceable in public life.\r\n\r\nTo get down to names. Many business men entered the service of the\r\ngovernment during the war. Almost none of them left it with enhanced\r\nreputations. Mr. Frank A. Vanderlip, who served in the Treasury\r\nDepartment, had little success, so the men who surrounded him felt. I am\r\nnot able to assess the causes of his failure. Perhaps he had assigned to\r\nhim an impossible task.\r\n\r\nSimilarly men who had contact with him while financing the Republican\r\ncampaign of 1916 were disappointed. After his service at Washington he\r\nceased to be head of a great Wall Street bank. What do these adverse\r\ncircumstances mean regarding Mr. Vanderlip's fitness to be, let us say,\r\nSecretary of the Treasury? Precisely nothing, let us admit. And his\r\nsuccess for a number of years in banking, the large fortune he\r\naccumulated, by the same reasoning, mean no more.\r\n\r\nMr. Vanderlip is one of our best known business men, yet what the public\r\nknows about him is nothing. He was the president of a great bank and\r\namassed wealth. An old financial journalist, he has gift of speech and\r\nwriting, unusual in the business world. His agreeable personality made\r\nhim liked by editors. He achieved unusual publicity. Was his reputation\r\nsolidly based or was it newspaper made? The public does not know, cannot\r\nknow. I use his case by way of illustration. Perhaps he ought to be\r\nPresident of the United States. But choosing a man for office on the\r\nbasis of his business success, even so well known a man as Mr.\r\nVanderlip, is plainly enough blind gambling.\r\n\r\nWe have in office now one of the great business men of the country. Mr.\r\nAndrew W. Mellon, Secretary of the Treasury, who is posed somewhat\r\nuneasily upon what is, many say, the highest pile of wealth any one has\r\never heaped up, except Mr. John D. Rockefeller. I say \"somewhat\r\nuneasily\" because I have in mind Mr. Mellon emerging from a\r\nCongressional hearing at the Capitol, flustered and uncomfortable,\r\nturning to a subordinate and asking anxiously, \"Well, did I make a good\r\nimpression?\" What could a subordinate reply except, \"Yes, Mr. Mellon,\r\nyou did very well.\"?\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Mellon does not make a good impression on the witness stand. If\r\nhe were unjustly accused of a crime he would hang himself by appearing\r\nin his own defense, unless the jury sensed in his stammering hesitancy\r\nnot guilt but an honest inability to express himself.\r\n\r\nMr. Mellon is the shyest and most awkward man who ever rose to power. He\r\nis unhappy before Congressional committees, before reporters in the\r\ndreadful conferences which are the outward and visible evidence of our\r\ndemocracy, at Cabinet meetings, where the fluent Mr. Hughes casts him\r\nterribly in the shade.\r\n\r\nAt one such meeting the President dragged him forth from silence by\r\nturning to him and asking him, \"What has the Sphinx here got to say on\r\nthe subject.\" Thus impelled, the Secretary of the Treasury replied,\r\nunconsciously in the words of Sir Roger de Coverley, \"Well, Mr.\r\nPresident, I think there is a good deal to be said on both sides.\"\r\n\r\nIf we may believe the psychologists, the great object of acquiring\r\nwealth and power is the achievement of self-complacency. If it is, Mr.\r\nMellon has somehow missed it. You can not imagine him writing himself\r\ndown beside the others in the great American copy book and saying\r\nseriously to the youth of the land, \"Look at me, I worked always fifteen\r\nminutes after the whistle blew and behold the result. Follow my\r\nfootsteps.\" No golden words issue from his mouth. Some unforgetable\r\npersonal measure of his own deserts, some standard peculiar to himself,\r\nperhaps, refuses to be buried under the vast accumulations.\r\n\r\nWere ever great abilities so tongue-tied as this? I ask this question\r\nnot to answer it. I merely hold Mr. Mellon up as the usually insoluble\r\nriddle, the why of great business success. But granting that the real\r\nMr. Mellon is shown in the enormous fortune and not in the timid asking\r\nof a subordinate, \"Did I make a good impression?\" does such shrinking,\r\nsuch ill adaptation, on the stage of public life make a contribution to\r\nthe unending drama of self-government?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANDREW W. MELLON, SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY]\r\n\r\nI take it that behind these footlights which we call Washington, just as\r\nbehind the literal footlights, the actors, if there is to be any lifting\r\nof us up, must play a part with which we can identify ourselves in our\r\nimagination. He must be articulate. He must get across. Mr. Harding\r\ndoes it admirably. You watch him and you realize that he is the oldest\r\nof stage heroes, Everyman. You say to yourself unconsciously, \"Only the\r\naccident of seven million majority separates him from me.\" You are\r\nlifted up. Ordinary flesh and blood can do this great thing.\r\n\r\nBased on this desire to identify ourselves with greatness is our\r\nfamiliar aphorism, \"The office makes the man.\" All that is necessary is\r\nthe office to \"make\" the least of us.\r\n\r\nRoosevelt played the part even better than Mr. Harding, \"an ordinary man\r\nraised to the nth power.\" He strutted to fill the eye. He was the\r\nconsummation of articulateness. The point is that self-government must\r\nbe dramatic or it does not carry along the self-governors.\r\n\r\nOf course one must not overlook the fact that \"the great silent man\" is\r\na consolation to common inarticulateness and ineffectiveness, the\r\ngeneral belief that where there is a slow tongue profundity is found\r\nbeing one of those pleasant things which we like to think about\r\nourselves--\"we could and we would.\" But after all there is a sense of\r\npity about our kind attribution of hidden power to dullness. We are half\r\naware that we are compensating.\r\n\r\nAnyway, even if the great business man is at home upon the stage, which\r\nMr. Mellon is not, the calling of him to office interrupts the drama of\r\nself-government. We admit our failure and call in the gods from another\r\nworld. It is as I have said a staged receivership. We can not identify\r\nourselves with the hero. We are poor worms, not millionaires. We might\r\nhave the seven million majority but we could not also stand upon a pile\r\nof seven million gold dollars. Government ceases to be human. It becomes\r\nsuperhuman. And self-government must be human.\r\n\r\nOf course, I exaggerate. Mr. Mellon coming from that other world is not\r\nwholly without his human relations. I have alluded to his symbolizing\r\nthe wish-fulfilment of the inarticulate, and the inarticulate are many.\r\nHe does more. He fits admirably into what Mr. Walter Lippmann has called\r\nin his new book one of our popular stereotypes. We demand a conflict\r\nbetween reality and the stage. We like to see the masks pulled off our\r\nactors. One of our best received traditions is that a man who has a\r\nfight with the politicians has performed a great service. We like to see\r\nour strutters strut in a little fear of us.\r\n\r\nBut Secretary Mellon's defeat of Representative Fordney, Senator Elkins,\r\nand Elmer Dover in their efforts to fill his department with politicians\r\nwas not so much a sign of power as a measure of the difference between\r\nMr. Mellon's world and theirs.\r\n\r\nMr. Mellon comes into the Treasury from his bank. All he knows is\r\nbanking, not politics. If he went from the Mellon Bank to the National\r\nCity Bank of New York he would not discharge all the National City Bank\r\nemployees and bring in a lot of men who had never seen the inside of a\r\nbank before, whom he did not know, who didn't speak the same language\r\nthat he did. It is only in politics that one finds such perfect faith in\r\nman as man.\r\n\r\nHe goes to one young Democrat in the Department--this actually\r\nhappened--and he says, \"Young man, I like your work. I want you to stay\r\nwith me,\" \"Ah, but, Mr. Mellon, I can't,\" plead this Democrat, \"You\r\nreally can't do things that way. It is not done. You will have all the\r\nRepublican politicians about your ears.\"\r\n\r\nBut it was not a sense of power in Mr. Mellon that made him thus defy\r\nthe conventions. It was merely the instinct of self-protection. He could\r\nnot live in the atmosphere of politics. He had to do things as he always\r\nhad done them. The Gods coming down from high Olympus among the sons and\r\ndaughters of men were probably never as much at ease as the Greeks made\r\nthem out to be.\r\n\r\nWith his millions behind him Mr. Mellon was a solid object in his\r\nconflict with the politicians. Without them one does not know what would\r\nhave happened between him and Mr. Fordney, Mr. Elkins, and Mr. Dover.\r\n\r\nWhat is a good Secretary of the Treasury? We have a stereotype about\r\nthat, too, one slowly and painfully formed. A good Secretary of the\r\nTreasury is one who has seen the inside of a bank, who has read the\r\nbooks on finance and knows the rules. Originally our Secretaries of the\r\nTreasury were amateurs, like our generals who beat ploughshares into\r\nswords. When one got into trouble, he boarded the Congressional Limited\r\nfor New York and saw Mr. Morgan. Mr. Morgan came out of his bank holding\r\nthe safety of the nation in his hands, exhibiting it to reporters who\r\nwrote all about it, assuring the public.\r\n\r\nAt length it was decided to keep the safety of the nation at Washington.\r\nAnd our Secretaries of the Treasury tended to become professional. The\r\nyoung men who tell us whether we have a good Secretary of the Treasury\r\nor not are the financial writers of the newspapers. The Secretary acts.\r\nThe young men look in the books and see that he has conformed to the\r\nrules. When he has he leaves nothing to be desired as Secretary.\r\n\r\nMr. Mellon's relation to Alexander Hamilton is the same as Marshal\r\nFoch's relation to Napoleon; one knew war from his own head, the other\r\nknows it from the teachers. Mr. Mellon's administration is not inspired.\r\nIn the greatest financial crisis in our history he has no constructive\r\nsuggestion to make. You would hardly know that Secretary Houston was\r\ngone and Mr. Mellon had come. And there is an explanation for this\r\ncontinuity, beside that of the rule books. The hard work of the\r\nDepartment has been done under both administrations by Assistant\r\nSecretary S. P. Gilbert, for Mr. Mellon has the successful man's habit\r\nof leaning heavily upon an able and industrious subordinate. Mr. Gilbert\r\nis an ambitious young lawyer who has mastered the books and who works 18\r\nhours a day. The voice is the voice of Mellon but the hand is the hand\r\nof Gilbert.\r\n\r\nI have analyzed Mr. Mellon at Washington although only a small fraction\r\nof his career is involved and although he operates in the difficult\r\ncircumstances of an unknown and unfavorable environment. But he is\r\nperceptible in Washington, he does appear before Congressional\r\nCommittees and at newspaper conferences. You can study the Gilberts who\r\nsurround him. You can estimate the prepossessions that enter into our\r\njudgment of him. You can measure him against the standard of public\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nIn Pittsburg he is more remote. He is hedged about with the secrecy of\r\nbusiness. He is to be seen only through the golden aura of a great\r\nfortune, sitting shy and awkward upon an eminence, the product of forces\r\nand personalities which can only be guessed at.\r\n\r\nHe was the son of a banker and inherited a considerable fortune. He\r\noperated in a city which expanded fabulously in the course of his\r\nlifetime. If he is shy and unbusiness-worldly, he has a brother who has\r\nthat force of personality which we usually associate with fitness for\r\nlife. His bank was the chosen instrument of Henry C. Frick, one of the\r\npioneer demigods, who could make the business reputations of men who\r\nproved adaptable to his uses.\r\n\r\nThus into the result there enters the power of Frick, the thrust upward\r\nof Pittsburg, an industrial volcano, the associated personality of the\r\nother Mellon. You have to give a name to all this combination of\r\nfavoring circumstances and favoring personalities and names are usually\r\ngiven arbitrarily. The name given in this case is Andrew W. Mellon. But\r\nhow much of it is Andrew W. Mellon and how much of it is Pittsburg, how\r\nmuch of it Frick, how much of it brother Mellon, an electorate seeking a\r\nbusiness man for office can not stop to inquire and can not learn if it\r\ndoes inquire.\r\n\r\nIf the people elect a man like Mr. Mellon to office they do not enlist\r\nin the public service the combination of persons and forces which is\r\nknown by his name. Or if he is all that he seems to be, measured by his\r\ngreat fortune, perhaps they get him after he has spent his force or\r\nafter his head is turned by success, or at any rate they put him into an\r\nunfamiliar milieu and subject him to that corrupting temptation, the\r\ndesire for a second term or for a higher office.\r\n\r\nAnd to go back to what I have said before, they make self-government go\r\ninto bankruptcy and ask for a receiver.\r\n\r\nThe great business-man President is just a romantic development of the\r\ngreat business-man illusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE BOTTLE NECK OF THE CABINET, AND WHAT IS IN THE BOTTLE\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Mellon's associates in the Cabinet were most of them chosen on\r\nsubstantially the same principles as he was, namely, that success in\r\nbusiness or professional life implies fitness for public life. We have\r\nno other standard. The present Cabinet is an \"exceptionally good\"\r\nCabinet. Many of its members are millionaires.\r\n\r\nSome of them owe their place to the rule that those who help elect a\r\nPresident are entitled to the honor, the advertising, or the\r\n\"vindication,\" of high public office.\r\n\r\nThat is to say, the same considerations that rule in the selection of\r\nSenators rule in their selection. They were recruited from the class\r\nfrom which Senators are recruited. I can not say the mental level of the\r\nCabinet is above that of the Senate. Take out of the upper house its two\r\nstrongest members, its two weakest, and half a dozen of the average\r\nsort, and you construct a body in every way equal to the Cabinet of Mr.\r\nHarding in intelligence and public morals.\r\n\r\nMost of them, never having been members of the upper house, have not\r\nsuffered from the depreciation in the public eye which attends service\r\nin the legislative branch. They come rather from the wonderful business\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThere are, moreover, few of them compared to Senators. Smallness of\r\nnumbers suggests careful selection, superior qualifications.\r\n\r\nAnd the secrecy of Cabinet meetings makes them impressive. If reporters\r\nwere present, the public would realize that the Cabinet as a Cabinet was\r\nmostly occupied with little things.\r\n\r\nThe records prove it.\r\n\r\nThe biweekly meetings of the Cabinet are commonly followed by the\r\nannouncement: \"The Cabinet had a short session today. Nothing of\r\nimportance was discussed\"; or, \"Details of administration were\r\ndiscussed.\" Now, of course, reasons of state may occasionally restrain\r\nthe disclosure of what actually was the subject before the Cabinet. Yet\r\nMr. Harding's administration has been in office more than a year, and\r\nhow many important policies has it adopted? How much wisdom has emerged\r\nfrom the biweekly meetings?\r\n\r\nSample announcements of the Cabinet meetings run like this: \"The Cabinet\r\nlistened to the Postmaster General, explaining how much it would\r\nfacilitate the handling of the mails if people would distribute the\r\nmailing of their letters throughout the day, instead of keeping most of\r\nthem to mail late in the afternoon when they are leaving their offices.\r\nThe Postmaster General pointed out that the government departments were\r\noffenders in this respect.\" Useful; but why should the whole nation worry\r\nabout who advises with the President over the inveterate bad habits of\r\nthe people as letter writers?\r\n\r\nOr this: \"The Cabinet spent an hour and a half today discussing what to\r\ndo with the property left in the government's hands by the war. There\r\nare millions of dollars' worth of such property.\" A mere detail of\r\nadministration, but it came before the Cabinet as a whole because more\r\nthan one department was left in control of the property.\r\n\r\nMoreover, you may estimate the importance of cabinets from the fact\r\nthat, after all, every administration takes its color from the\r\nPresident. Mr. Wilson's administration was precisely Mr. Wilson. Mr.\r\nHarding's is precisely Mr. Harding.\r\n\r\nListen to the experience of a Cabinet adviser. One of the most important\r\nSecretaries was explaining to some friends a critical situation. \"But,\"\r\ninterjected one of the listeners, \"does President Harding understand\r\nthat?\" \"The President,\" replied the Secretary, \"never has time really to\r\nunderstand anything.\"\r\n\r\nAnd remember how Secretary Hughes told the President that the Four Power\r\nPact covered with its guarantees the home islands of Japan, and how a\r\ncouple of days later Mr. Harding informed the press that it did not\r\ncover the home islands of Japan; when it transpired that the information\r\nof Mr. Hughes on this point had effected no lodgement in the President's\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nThe Presidential mind; that is the bottle neck through which everything\r\nhas to pass.\r\n\r\nSuppose we had today the greatest statesman that this country has ever\r\nproduced as Secretary of State. Let us say Alexander Hamilton, for\r\nexample. What could Alexander Hamilton do as the head of Mr. Harding's\r\nCabinet? We shall assume that Alexander Hamilton had the mind to grasp\r\nthe problem of this country's relations to the world and of its interest\r\nin the world's recovery from the havoc and the hatreds of the war, and\r\nthe constructive imagination to reach a solution of it. What could\r\nAlexander Hamilton do? His avenue of approach to world problems would be\r\nMr. Harding. All that was in the mind of Alexander Hamilton, Secretary\r\nof State, would have to pass through the mind of Warren G. Harding,\r\nPresident, before it would become effective.\r\n\r\nThe passage through would be blocked by many obstacles, for Mr. Harding\r\nhas a perfectly conventional mind; that is why he is President. One of\r\nthe pictures in Mr. Harding's head is the mechanistic, the God's Time\r\npicture. \"Things left to themselves will somehow come out all right.\"\r\nAnother is the racial inferiority complex. \"Man is inadequate to attempt\r\ncontrol of his own destiny. There are the forces to be considered.\" A\r\nthird is the great business-man illusion. Mr. Morgan going abroad to\r\nconsider reparations may accomplish the wonders which mere statesmen can\r\nnot. All these induce avoidance of responsibility, and Mr. Harding has\r\nthe human liking for avoiding responsibility. Pressed by Mr. Hamilton,\r\nMr. Harding would say: \"But I can not move the Senate.\" Pressed further,\r\nhe would say: \"There is Public Opinion. We shall lose the election if we\r\nbecome involved in European affairs. You and I know those Allied war\r\ndebts are worthless, but how can we make the people realize that they\r\nare worthless?\"\r\n\r\nLike the rest of us, Mr. Harding perhaps has none of these pictures so\r\nfirmly in his head as before the war; but the damage to the pictures\r\nonly makes him more vacillating. I am assuming in all this that Mr.\r\nHamilton has a free mind, which he had, relatively, when he operated a\r\ncentury and a half ago. At that time he had not to think much of Public\r\nOpinion or of parties. And the mechanistic theory of Progress, that\r\nthings come out all right with the least possible human intervention or\r\nonly the intervention of the business man, had not then assumed its\r\npresent importance.\r\n\r\n\"Mind,\" says a nameless writer in the _London Nation_, \"is incorrigibly\r\ncreative.\" It has created so many vast illusions like those above in\r\nthe last century and a half that like the American spirit in Kipling's\r\npoem:\r\n\r\n    \"Elbowed out by sloven friends,\r\n    It camps, at sufferance, on the stoop.\"\r\n\r\nWhere our actual Secretary's mind falls short of our supposititious\r\nSecretary's mind is in the valuable quality of common sense. I am even\r\nprepared to maintain that as a measure of reality Mr. Hughes's mind is\r\ndistinctly inferior to Mr. Harding's, which is one reason why he never\r\ndid become President and Mr. Harding did. I can not better explain what\r\nI mean than on the basis of this quotation from a recent book of Mr.\r\nOrage, the British critic:\r\n\r\n\"Common sense is the community of the senses or faculties; in its\r\noutcome it is the agreement of their reports. A thing is said to be\r\ncommon sense when it satisfies the heart, the mind, the emotion and all\r\nthe senses; when, in fact, it satisfies all our various criteria of\r\nreality.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Hughes has only one criterion of reality, his mind, which has been\r\ndeveloped at the expense of all his other means of approach to the\r\ntruth. He lives in a region of facts, principles, and logical\r\ndeductions. He does not sense anything. And only men who sense reality\r\nhave common sense. For Mr. Hughes facts are solid; you can make two\r\nnice, orderly little piles of them and build a logical bridge over the\r\ninterval between them. A true statesman builds a bridge resting on\r\nnothing palpable, and nevertheless he crosses over it.\r\n\r\nMr. Hughes's mind operates in a region of perfect demonstration; he even\r\ndemonstrates things to himself. A true statesman never succeeds in\r\ndemonstrating anything to himself; he uses demonstration only in dealing\r\nwith others. Yet he arrives in other than logical ways at a sureness for\r\nhimself which is never Mr. Hughes's. For the Secretary of State\r\nstatesmanship is an intellectual exercise, for the true statesman it is\r\nthe exercise of a dozen other faculties. An extraordinary but limited\r\nmind, Mr. Hughes impresses us as the boy lightning calculator does, and\r\nleaves us unsatisfied.\r\n\r\nTake Mr. Hughes's handling of Mexican relations as an example of what I\r\nhave called statesmanship made a purely intellectual exercise. The\r\npractical result which was to be desired when Mr. Hughes took office was\r\nstability and order in Mexico, the safety of American property there,\r\nand a restoration of diplomatic intercourse.\r\n\r\nMr. Hughes does not seek to obtain these results. Instead he works out\r\nthe following problem: _a_ + _b_ = _c_, in which _a_ is the fact that\r\nCarranza had issued a decree making possible the confiscation of\r\nAmerican property in Mexico, _b_ is the principle of international law\r\nthat at the basis of relations between peoples must be safety of alien\r\nproperty, and _c_ is a note to Mexico.\r\n\r\nMr. Hughes was excited over the perfection of this intellectual\r\noperation. He read his note with all the jubilance of the Greek\r\nphilosopher who, having discovered an important principle of physics,\r\nexclaimed: \"Eureka.\" Mr. Hughes's Eureka is always a piece of paper. He\r\nis a lawyer whose triumphs are briefs and contracts.\r\n\r\nNow the facts were not merely that Carranza had made an offensive\r\ngesture, issuing the famous decree; but that Mexico had not confiscated\r\nAmerican property and lived in such fear of her strong neighbor that she\r\nwas never likely to do so, that the Mexican supreme court had ruled\r\nconfiscation to be illegal, that the Obregon government was as stable\r\nand as good a government as Mexico was likely to have, and that it was\r\nto our interest to support it morally rather than encourage further\r\nrevolution there. They all pointed to recognition.\r\n\r\nThe validity of the piece of paper that Mr. Hughes demanded of Obregon\r\nwould rest upon international law. But so did the validity of our right\r\nto have our property in Mexico respected. We should not be in any\r\nstronger legal position to intervene in Mexico if she violated the\r\ncontract Mr. Hughes wanted, than if she violated our property rights\r\nthere unfortified by such a piece of paper. Both rested on one and the\r\nsame law.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Mexico being weak and sensitive, an arbitrary demand that\r\nshe \"take the pledge,\" such as Mr. Hughes made, was sure to offend her\r\npride, and delay the consummation everyone wished--stability across the\r\nborder and a restoration of good relations. Yet Mr. Hughes was immensely\r\nsatisfied with his intellectual exercise _a_ + _b_ = _c_, _c_ being not\r\na solution of the Mexican problem, which at this writing is still afar\r\noff, but a piece of paper, a note to Mexico. The sheer logical triumph\r\nof the deduction of _c_ from _a_ and _b_ is to Mr. Hughes an end in\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nNow, of course, it is not wholly overdevelopment of mind at the expense\r\nof the other criteria of reality which leads Mr. Hughes to vain\r\nexercises like _a_ + _b_ = _c_. He has what a recent writer has\r\ndescribed as \"an inflamed legal sense.\" He has, moreover, by an\r\nassociation of ideas all his own oddly transferred to law that\r\nsacredness with which he was brought up to regard the Bible. \"Sanctity\r\nof contracts,\" is his favorite phrase, the word \"sanctity\" being highly\r\nsignificant. He has, besides, Mr. Harding over him, and the Senate to\r\nreckon with. And in the case of Mexico he has as a fellow Cabinet\r\nmember, Mr. Fall, the picture in whose head is of a \"white man\" teaching\r\na \"greaser\" to respect him. He has to think of winning elections, of his\r\nown political ambitions. All these inhibitory influences which generally\r\nproduce negation do not estop Mr. Hughes. His mind is too vigorous for\r\nthat. It pursues its way energetically to results, such as _a_ + _b_ =\r\n_c_.\r\n\r\nNow, of course, the handling of Mexican relations is not Mr. Hughes's\r\nmajor achievement. But even his major achievement, the Washington\r\nconference with its resultant nine pieces of paper, was more or less a\r\nlawyer's plea in avoidance.\r\n\r\nThe major problem which confronted Mr. Hughes was this: The Great War\r\nhad been followed, as Mr. H. G. Wells aptly says, by the Petty Peace. It\r\nwas threatening, and still threatens, to flame up again. The problem of\r\na real peace confronted Mr. Hughes, because Mr. Wilson had sought to\r\nestablish one and failed, and had thus set a certain standard of effort\r\nfor his successor. Moreover, Mr. Hughes had said that every man, woman,\r\nand child in the United States was vitally interested in the economic\r\nrecovery of Europe.\r\n\r\nMr. Hughes had either to face this task or divert the mind of the court\r\nto some other issue. He chose to find his _a_ + _b_ = _c_ elsewhere. The\r\nproblem of establishing peace where there was war was difficult; perhaps\r\nit was too hard for any man, but has not humanity--I say humanity\r\nbecause it is Mr. Harding's favorite word--has not humanity the right to\r\nask of its statesmen something more than timidity and avoidance? The\r\nproblem of establishing peace where there was peace, in the Orient, was\r\nrelatively easy.\r\n\r\nThe war had left the great sea powers with excessive navies and\r\ninsupportable naval budgets. All wanted naval limitation. It was only\r\nnecessary to propose an agreement for reduction to have it accepted.\r\n\r\nEven the dramatic method of making the proposal, with details of the\r\ntonnage to be scrapped, was not Mr. Hughes's idea. Let us do the man in\r\nthe White House justice. He conceived it on the _Mayflower_; read it to\r\nSenator James Watson who was with him, and wirelessed it to the State\r\nDepartment.\r\n\r\nThere was the further problem, the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. Mr. Hughes\r\nwanted it ended. Japan and England wanted it substituted by a compact\r\nwhich should be signed by its two signatories and the United States.\r\n\r\nAll that Mr. Hughes had to do to establish peace where there was peace\r\nwas to offer an agreement upon naval armament and accept the\r\nAnglo-Japanese plan for a wider pact in the Pacific. The details would\r\ninvolve discussion, but the success of the general program was assured\r\nin advance.\r\n\r\nThe conference was called, hurriedly, because, as Mr. Harding once\r\nexplained, if he had not hastened someone else would have anticipated\r\nhim in calling it. This shows how obvious was the expedient. The idea of\r\nnaval limitation was no more original than the idea of the conference.\r\nMr. Borah had proposed it. Lord Lee had proposed it, in the British\r\nParliament. The idea of the Four Power Pact was made in England--it had\r\nlong been discussed there--and brought over by Mr., now Lord, Balfour.\r\nHe laid it at Mr. Hughes's feet.\r\n\r\nMr. Balfour sought no triumphs. They should all go to Mr. Hughes. He has\r\nthe art of inconspicuousness, the result of many generations of fine\r\nbreeding. As you saw him in the plenary sessions clutching the lapels of\r\nhis coat with both hands and modestly struggling for utterance after an\r\nimmense flow of words from our chief delegate, you could not help\r\nfeeling patriotic pride in the contrast.\r\n\r\nBesides, Mr. Balfour was captivated. He became, for the nonce, perfectly\r\nAmerican. Mr. H. Wickham Steed said to me, hearing the chief British\r\ndelegate speak: \"It is a new Balfour at this conference.\" Certainly as\r\nyou heard the voice, moved and moving, emotional perhaps for the first\r\ntime in his life, you realized that it was not Mr. Balfour, \"proceeding\r\non his faded way\" as the _London Nation_ expressed it, who was speaking.\r\nIt was Mr. Balfour as he might be at a great revival meeting, such as\r\nMr. Hughes in his youth must have often attended.\r\n\r\nOn the Four Power Pact the best comment ever made was Mr. Frank\r\nSimonds's, \"It was invented to save the British Empire from committing\r\nbigamy.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARTHUR BALFOUR]\r\n\r\nThe results of the Washington conference were substantial. They put off\r\nwar where none was threatening. Perhaps in the longer future they\r\nwill be seen to be no more than a prolongation of the intent of the\r\nVersailles treaty, confirming the dichotomy of powers which that\r\ninstrument created. Germany, Russia, and China were treated as outsiders\r\nin both conferences.\r\n\r\nBut the great _a_ + _b_ = _c_ of last winter left peace where there is\r\nwar still unwritten. The problem which \"humanity\" posed to Mr. Hughes is\r\nas yet unattempted. It is as exigent as ever. Immensely plausible as he\r\nis, events have a way of overtaking him. Remembering what happened on\r\nelection night in 1916, I think one cannot sum him up better than by\r\nsaying that he has the habit of always being elected in the early\r\nreturns. As in the case of the lightning calculator, after you have\r\nrecovered from your first surprise at his mental exhibition you are\r\ninclined to ask, \"But what is the good of it all?\"\r\n\r\nThe two most important advisers to the President in the existing Cabinet\r\nare Mr. Hughes and Mr. Hoover. The limitations of the Secretary of State\r\nare the limitations of a legalistic mind. The limitations of Mr. Hoover\r\nare the limitations of a scientific mind. Men, considered politically,\r\ndo not behave like mathematical factors nor like chemical elements.\r\n\r\nSomeone asked Mr. Hoover recently why he sent corn to Russia instead of\r\nwheat. \"Because,\" replied the Secretary of Commerce without a moment's\r\nhesitation, \"for one dollar I can buy so many calories\"--carrying it\r\nout to the third decimal place--\"in corn, and only so many\"--again to\r\nthe third decimal place--\"in wheat. I get about twice as many in corn as\r\nin wheat.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Hoover is at his best in feeding a famished population. He then has\r\nmen where he wants them--I say this without meaning to reflect upon Mr.\r\nHoover's humanitarian impulses; perhaps I should better say he then has\r\nmen where for the free operation of his scientific mind he requires to\r\nhave them. For in a famine men become mere chemical retorts. You pour\r\ninto them a certain number of calories. Oxidization produces a certain\r\nenergy. And the exact energy necessary to sustain life is calculable.\r\n\r\nIn a famine men cease to be individuals. They can not say, \"I never ate\r\ncorn. I do not know how to cook corn. I do not like corn.\" They behave\r\nin perfectly calculable ways. So many calories, oxidization; so much\r\nenergy.\r\n\r\nConceive a society in which results were always calculable: so many men,\r\nso much fuel, so much consequent horsepower, and Mr. Hoover would make\r\nfor it an admirable benevolent dictator; for he is benevolent. If\r\nBolshevism at its most complete exemplification had been a success and\r\nbecome the order of the world, Mr. Hoover might have made a great head\r\nof a state; with labor conscripted and food conscripted, all you would\r\nhave to do would be to apply the food, counted in calories, to the\r\nlabor, and production in a readily estimable quantity would ensue. I am\r\nnot trying to suggest that this represents Mr. Hoover's ideal of\r\nsociety; it surely does not. I am only saying that this is the kind of\r\nsociety in which Mr. Hoover would develop his fullest utility.\r\n\r\nScience inevitably reduces man to the calculable automaton, otherwise it\r\ncan deduce no laws about him;--such as, for example, the legal man, a\r\nfiction that haunts Mr. Hughes's brain; the chemical retort man, of Mr.\r\nHoover's mind; the economic man, another convenient fiction; the\r\nscientific socialism man, another pure fiction, derived from the\r\neconomic man and forming the basis for Bolshevism at its fullest\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nNow if Chemistry should somehow acquire eccentricity, so that two\r\nelements combined in a retort would sometimes produce one result and\r\nsometimes another totally different, the chemist would be no more unsure\r\nin his mind than is Mr. Hoover, operating for the first time in a\r\nsociety of free, self-governing men. Or perhaps it would be a better\r\nanalogy to say that if the chemist when he put an agent into a retort\r\ncould not be sure what other elements were already in it, and could not\r\ntell whether the result would be an explosion or a pleasant and useful\r\nrecombination, he would be somewhat in the position of Mr. Hoover.\r\n\r\nYou will observe that I am trying to dissociate the real Hoover from the\r\nmyth Hoover, always a difficult process, which may require years for\r\nits accomplishment. I do not pretend that this is the final\r\ndissociation. All we know with certainty of the real Hoover is that when\r\nhe has society at the starvation line and can say \"so many calories, so\r\nmuch energy,\" he works with extraordinary sureness.\r\n\r\nWhen he operates in a normal society he takes his chemical agent in hand\r\nand consults Mr. Harding, Mr. Daugherty, or Mr. Weeks as to what agents\r\nthere are in the political retort, and whether the placing of his agent\r\nin with them will produce an explosion or a profitable recombination.\r\n\r\nSo you see the practical utility of his mind is conditioned upon the\r\nminds of Mr. Harding, Mr. Weeks, and Mr. Daugherty. It is a fertile\r\nmind, which invents, however, only minor chemical reactions, neither he\r\nnor Mr. Harding being sure enough about the dirty and incalculable\r\nvessel of politics to know when an explosion may result, and neither of\r\nthem being bold enough to take chances.\r\n\r\nMr. Hughes, Mr. Hoover, and Mr. Daugherty are the only outstanding\r\nfigures in the Cabinet. The Attorney General lives in an unreal world of\r\nhis own, which at the moment of this writing threatens to come tumbling\r\ndown about his head.\r\n\r\nThe clue to Mr. Daugherty's world is found in a sentence of Thomas\r\nFelder's letter apropos of the failure to collect the $25,000 fee for\r\nsecuring the release of Charles W. Morse from prison, in which he tells\r\nhow he associated with himself Mr. Daugherty, \"who stood as close to the\r\nPresident as any other lawyer or citizen of the United States.\"\r\n\"Standing close,\" men may laugh at the gods, may \"take the cash and let\r\nthe credit go.\" It is a world of little things without any tomorrow.\r\nLong views and large views do not matter. Forces? Principles? Perhaps,\r\nbut the main thing is all men should \"stand close.\" It is an immensely\r\nhuman world, where men if they are not masters of their own destiny may\r\nat least cheat fate for a little brief hour, if only they remain true to\r\neach other no matter what befalls.\r\n\r\nMr. Harding, one side of him belongs to that world of Mr. Daugherty's,\r\nwhile another side belongs to that larger political world where morals,\r\nwrapped in vague sentimental words, hold sway. It is because he belongs\r\nto that world that Mr. Daugherty is Attorney General. Mr. Daugherty\r\n\"stood close\" to Mr. Harding all his life. \"Standing close\" creates an\r\nobligation. Mr. Harding, as President, must in return \"stand close\" to\r\nMr. Daugherty.\r\n\r\nHe does so. To the caller who visited him when the Morse-Felder letters\r\nwere coming out daily, and who was apprehensive of the consequences, the\r\nPresident said, \"You don't know Harry Daugherty. He is as clean and\r\nhonorable a man as there is in this country.\" In such a world as this,\r\nyour friend can do no wrong. Goldstein, who received the $2,500 from\r\nLowden's campaign manager, belongs to it. Therefore, he can do no wrong.\r\nTherefore, his name goes from the White House to the Senate for\r\nconfirmation as Collector of Internal Revenue at St. Louis.\r\n\r\nTo go back to the time before he became Attorney General, Daugherty\r\npracticed law in Columbus, Ohio. His cases came to him, largely as the\r\nMorse retainer did, because he \"stood close\" to somebody, to the\r\nPresident, to Senators, to Governors of Ohio, or Legislatures of Ohio.\r\nHis was not a highly lucrative practice, for Mr. Daugherty is one of the\r\nfew relatively poor men in the present Cabinet. You may deduce from this\r\ncircumstance a conclusion as favorable as that which the President, who\r\nknows him so well, does. I am concerned only in presenting the facts. At\r\nleast Mr. Daugherty did not grow rich out of \"standing close.\"\r\n\r\nNor did he accumulate a reputation. When men \"stand close\" those who are\r\noutside the circle invariably regard them with a certain suspicion. Your\r\nprofessional politician, for that is what Daugherty was, always is an\r\nobject of doubt. And for this reason he always seeks what is technically\r\nknown as a \"vindication.\" Conscious of his own rectitude, as he measures\r\nit, he may come out of office cleared in the world's eyes, and with a\r\nfine title, to boot, ready for life upon a new level. And this\r\n\"vindication\" sometimes does take place.\r\n\r\nI have no doubt that Mr. Daugherty entered office with the most\r\nexcellent intentions. He had everything to gain personally from \"making\r\na record\" in the Attorney Generalship, a title and a higher standing at\r\nthe bar. Moreover, he was the loyal friend of the President and desired\r\nthe success of the administration.\r\n\r\nBut it is not so easy. You cannot one moment by \"standing close\" laugh\r\nat the gods and the next range yourself easily and commodiously on the\r\nside of the gods. The gods may be unkind even to those who mean to be\r\nwith them from the outset, establishing their feet firmly upon logic or\r\nupon calories; how much more so may they be with those who would\r\nsuddenly change sides?\r\n\r\nAt least it is a matter that admits of no compromise. What is he going\r\nto do in office with those who \"stood close\" to him as he \"stood close\"\r\nto President Taft? All the \"close standers\" turn up in Washington. For\r\nexample, Mr. Felder, who \"stood close\" in the Morse case and who perhaps\r\nfor that reason appears as counsel in the Bosch-Magneto case, where the\r\nprosecution moves slowly, and who moreover permits himself some\r\nindiscretions. There is a whole army of \"close standers.\" There are the\r\nprosecutions that move slowly. Neither circumstance is necessarily\r\nsignificant. There are always the \"close standers.\" Prosecutions always\r\nmove slowly. But the two circumstances together!\r\n\r\nI present all this merely to show what kind of adviser the Attorney\r\nGeneral is, his limited conception of life on this little world, and\r\nlife's, perhaps temporary, revenge upon him. No one at this writing can\r\npass judgment, so I give, along with the facts and the appearances, the\r\nbest testimonial that a man can have, that quoted above from the\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\nIn physique the Attorney General is burly, thick-necked, his eyes are\r\nunsteady, his face alternately jovial and minatory,--I should say he\r\nbluffed effectively,--rough in personality, a physical law requiring\r\nthat bodies easily cemented together, and thus \"standing close,\" should\r\nnot have too smooth an exterior. His view of the world being highly\r\npersonal, his instinctive idea of office is that it, too, is personal,\r\nsomething to be used, always within the law, to aid friends and punish\r\nenemies. He wrote once to a newspaper, which was opposing his\r\nappointment, in substance that he would be Attorney General in spite of\r\nit and that he had a long memory.\r\n\r\nSecretary of War Weeks is the only other general adviser of Mr. Harding\r\nin the Cabinet. He is politically minded. Like Mr. Harding he is half of\r\nthe persuasion of Mr. Daugherty about organization, and half of the\r\nother persuasion about the sway of moral forces. All in all he is\r\nnearer akin mentally to the President than any other member of the\r\nCabinet, but with more industry and more capacity for details than his\r\nchief. He is of the clean desk tradition; Mr. Harding is not.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ATTORNEY-GENERAL H. M. DAUGHERTY]\r\n\r\nHalf politician and half business man, he interprets business to the\r\npolitician, and politics to business. He is a middle grounder. He quit\r\nbanking satisfied with a moderate fortune, saying, \"The easiest thing I\r\never did was to make money.\"\r\n\r\nHis bland voice and mild manner indicate the same moderation in\r\neverything that he showed in making money; his narrowing eyes, the\r\ncaution which led him to quit banking when he went into politics.\r\n\r\nPolitics intrigues him, but he has not a first-class mind for it, as his\r\nexperiences in Massachusetts proved.\r\n\r\nFrank to the utmost limits his caution will permit, people like him, but\r\nnot passionately. Men respect his ability, but they do not feel strongly\r\nabout it. He never becomes the center of controversy, as Daugherty is,\r\nas Hoover has been, and as Hughes may at any time be. I have never seen\r\nhim angry, I have seen him enthusiastic. A Laodicean in short.\r\n\r\nSecretary Fall hoped to be one of the chief advisers, but has been\r\ndisappointed. Mr. Harding had said of him, \"His is the best mind in the\r\nSenate,\" but he has found other minds more to his liking in the Cabinet.\r\n\r\nWith a long drooping mustache, he looks like a stage sheriff of the Far\r\nWest in the movies. His voice is always loud and angry. He has the\r\nfrontiers-man's impatience. From his kind lynch law springs.\r\n\r\nHe wanted to lynch Mexico. When he entered the Cabinet he said to his\r\nSenate friends, \"If they don't follow me on Mexico I shall resign.\" He\r\nhas been a negative rather than a positive force there regarding Mexico,\r\ndeviating Mr. Hughes into the ineffective position he occupies.\r\n\r\nHe has the frontiers-man's impatience of conservation. Probably he is\r\nright. His biggest contribution to his country's welfare will be oil\r\nland leases, like that of Teapot Dome.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of Agriculture, Mr. Wallace, is an excellent technical\r\nadviser, as unobtrusive as experts usually are.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Navy, Mr. Denby, with his flabby jowls and large\r\nshapeless mouth, has a big heart, and more enthusiasm than he has\r\nself-command, judgment, or intelligence. He committed political suicide\r\ncheerfully, when the Cannon machine in the House fell into disfavor. He\r\nwould do anything for a friend, not as Mr. Daugherty would because it\r\npays, but because he is a friend. A cause commands an equal loyalty from\r\nhim. Just because his head is not as big as his heart he is a minor\r\nfactor.\r\n\r\nMr. Davis, Secretary of Labor, is a professional glad hand man,\r\nappointed because the administration meant to extend nothing to Labor\r\nbut a glad hand. When a crisis presents itself in industrial relations,\r\nMr. Hoover, who spreads himself over several departments, attends to it.\r\nAt the conference on unemployment, which was Mr. Hoover's, the best and\r\nonly example of the unemployed present was the Secretary of Labor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE GREATEST COMMON DIVISOR OF MUCH LITTLENESS\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have a form of government suited to effect the will of a simple\r\nprimitive people, a people with one clear aim. When we are all of one\r\nmind the government works. The executive represents the general\r\nintention, Congress represents the same intention. The party in power\r\nowes its position to the thoroughness with which it expresses the common\r\npurpose. Or, if you go back further, the structure of business serves\r\nthe same social aim.\r\n\r\nNow, under such circumstances, it makes little difference where\r\nauthority resides, whether there is government by business, or\r\ngovernment by parties, or executive domination, or whether Congress is\r\nthe ruling branch. The result is the same, the single purpose of the\r\ncommunity finds its just expression.\r\n\r\nAnd so it was in the blessed nineties to which Mr. Harding would have us\r\nreturn. The people were united upon one end, the rapid appropriation of\r\nthe virgin wealth of this continent and its distribution among the\r\npublic, and they had no doubt this was being admirably accomplished by\r\nthe existing business structure. Parties and governments were\r\nsubsidiary. The system worked.\r\n\r\nIn a pioneer society waste is unimportant; it may even be economy.\r\nForests are cut and all but the choicest wood thrown away. They are not\r\nreplanted. While they are so plentiful it would be a waste of time and\r\neffort to use the poor timber or to replace the felled trees.\r\n\r\nIn a similar society faulty distribution, which is ordinarily a social\r\nwaste, is unimportant. There is plenty for all. And it may even be a\r\nwaste of time and effort, checking accomplishment, to seek better\r\nadjustments. The object of society is the rapid exploitation of the\r\nresources nature has made available. Everyone gains in the process.\r\nJustice is a detail, as much a detail as is the inferior timber left to\r\nrot.\r\n\r\nWe no longer have the unity of aim of a pioneer society, yet we have not\r\nreadjusted our actual government in conformity with the altered social\r\nconsciousness. Instead we are trying to readjust ourselves to a practice\r\nthat is outworn. Having ceased to be pioneers, becoming various and\r\nhealthily divided, instead of making our system express the new variety\r\nin our life, and still function, we are trying to force ourselves by\r\nheavy penalties and awful bugaboos back into that unity under which our\r\nsystem does work.\r\n\r\nAnd when I say that we have a form of government suited only to a\r\npioneer society, though we have ceased to be a pioneer society, let no\r\none think that I would lay a profane hand upon that venerated\r\ninstrument, the Constitution of the United States. I am thinking only of\r\nthe Constitution's boasted elasticity. A new stretching is required, to\r\nfit a larger and more diversified society than that to which we have\r\nhitherto applied it.\r\n\r\nFor a simple, primitive people, for a pioneer society with but one task\r\nto accomplish,--the appropriation and distribution of the undeveloped\r\nresources of a continent,--details of distribution being unimportant\r\nwhere natural wealth was so vast, government by business or government\r\nby parties as the agents of business served admirably. The essential\r\nunity which is not to be found in our government of divided powers\r\nexisted in the single engrossing aim of the public.\r\n\r\nFor a temporary end, like the common defense, against an external enemy\r\nor against an imagined internal enemy, concentration upon the Executive\r\nalso serves. The unity of purpose which the nation has is imported into\r\nthe government through elevating the President into a dominant position.\r\nIn the one case the government is made to work by putting all branches\r\nof it under control of one authority outside itself; in the other, by\r\nupsetting the nice balance which the Fathers of the Constitution set up\r\nand, under the fiction of party authority, resorting to one man\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nBut what happens when there ceases to be a single aim, when the fruits\r\nof the earth are no longer sufficient to go around generously so that no\r\none need question his share, when a conflict of interests arises, when\r\nclasses begin to emerge, when in short we have the situation which\r\nexists in America today?\r\n\r\nLet us examine for a moment the Executive as a source of unity in the\r\ngovernment of such a divergent society. To make him executive minorities\r\nmust agree upon him. He must, to use Mr. Harding as an illustration, be\r\nsatisfactory to the farmers with one point of view and to Wall Street\r\nwith another, he must be acceptable to the Irish Americans and to the\r\nGerman Americans and to several other varieties of Americans, he must\r\ntake the fence between those who believe in a League of Nations and\r\nthose who hate a League of Nations, he must please capital and at the\r\nsame time not alienate labor.\r\n\r\nMr. Harding gave a glimpse of his difficulties when he said during the\r\ncampaign, \"I could make better speeches than these, but I have to be so\r\ncareful.\" The greatest common divisor of all the minorities that go to\r\nmaking a winning national combination must be neutral, he must be\r\ncolorless, he must not know that his soul is his own. The greatest\r\ncommon divisor of all the elements in the nation's political\r\nconsciousness today is inevitably a Mr. Harding. We shall probably have\r\na whole series of Mr. Hardings in the White House.\r\n\r\nAnd when this greatest common divisor of all the classes and all the\r\ninterests, this neutral, colorless person to whom no one can find any\r\nobjection, enters the White House does he represent Labor? So little\r\nthat he will not have a labor man in his Cabinet. Does he represent\r\nCapital? By instinct, by party training, by preference, yes, but capital\r\nis so divided that it is hard to represent, and the President, like the\r\ncandidate, \"has to be so careful.\" Does he represent the farmers? He\r\nsays so, but the farmers choose to be represented elsewhere, on the\r\nhill, where they can find agents whose allegiance is not so divided.\r\n\r\nAnd carefulness does not end upon election. Once a candidate always a\r\ncandidate. The entire first term of a president is his second candidacy.\r\nHis second term, if he wins one, is the candidacy of his successor, in\r\nwhose election he is vitally interested; for the continuance of his\r\nparty in power is the measure of public approval of himself. A president\r\nwho is the greatest common divisor of groups and interests \"must always\r\nbe so careful\" that he can never be a Roosevelt or a Wilson.\r\n\r\nRecapitulating the experiences of other peoples with political\r\ninstitutions, we have quickly, since our discovery of one man rule, run\r\nupon the period of little kings. The Carolingians have followed close\r\nupon the heels of the great Carl. The institution which in the first\r\ndecade of the twentieth century was a wonderful example of our capacity\r\nto adopt the rigors of a written constitution to our ends, of the\r\npractical genius of the American people, in the third decade of the\r\ntwentieth century is already dead.\r\n\r\nThe monarch with power, not the mere survival who satisfies the instinct\r\nfor the picturesque, for the play of the emotions in politics, is suited\r\nto an undifferentiated people pursuing a single simple end; one end, one\r\nman, many ends, many men is the rule. The greatest common divisor of\r\nsuch masses of men as inhabit this continent, so variously sprung, so\r\nvariously seeking their place in the sun, is something that has to be so\r\ncareful as to become a nullity.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason why our presidents should not become like all single\r\nheads of modern civilized peoples, largely ornamental, largely links\r\nwith the past, symbols to stir our inherited feelings as we watch their\r\ngracious progress through the movies. Mr. Harding is headed that way and\r\nif that Providence which watches over American destinies vouchsafes him\r\nto us for eight years instead of only four, the Presidency under him\r\nwill make progress toward a place alongside monarchy under King George.\r\n\r\nAlready, in the habit of blaming every failure and disappointment upon\r\nCongress, we see signs of the growth of the happy belief that the King\r\ncan do no wrong. When the King does nothing he can do no wrong.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason why we should not repeat the experiences of peoples\r\nwho have gone further upon the road of social differentiation than we\r\nhave and develop like them parliamentary government. By this I do not\r\nmean to echo the nonsense that has been written about having the Cabinet\r\nofficers sit in Congress.\r\n\r\nWhat is more likely to come is a new shift in the balance, a new\r\nmanifestation of our genius for the practical, which no written\r\nconstitution can restrain, which will place the initiative in the\r\nlegislative branch, whereas I have said, under Mr. Harding it is already\r\npassing, and which will make Congress rather than the President the\r\ndominant factor in our political life.\r\n\r\nThis process is already taking place.\r\n\r\nWhen President Harding asked the advice of the Senate whether he should\r\nrevive an old treaty with Germany suspended by the war, pointing proudly\r\nto the tenderness he was showing the partner of his political joys, he\r\nconceded an authority in the legislative branch which neither the\r\nConstitution nor our traditions had placed there. He took a step toward\r\nrecognizing the prospective dominance of Congress. It was one of many.\r\n\r\nIt is a long distance, as political institutions are measured, from\r\nPresident Wilson's telling the Senate that it must bow to his will even\r\nin dotting the i's and crossing the t's of the Versailles Treaty, to\r\nMr. Harding's asking the Senate what was its will regarding the old\r\nGerman treaty. Foreign relations are precisely the field where the\r\nexecutive power seems by the Constitution to have been most clearly\r\nestablished, yet it is just here that the legislative branch has made\r\nits most remarkable advance toward a dominating position; perhaps\r\nbecause this topic gained a temporary importance from the war and it was\r\nnaturally in the most significant area that the conflict between the two\r\nbranches of the government had to break out.\r\n\r\nWhen President Harding introduced the treaties and pacts resulting from\r\nthe Washington Conference into the Senate, he said that he had been a\r\nSenator and knew the Senate views, and that all the agreements he was\r\noffering for ratification had been negotiated with scrupulous regard to\r\nthe Senate's will. And he pleaded with the Senate not to disavow the\r\nExecutive and impair its standing in the conduct of foreign relations.\r\n\r\nNo more complete avowal could be made of the dominant position which the\r\nSenate has come to occupy in the diplomatic affairs of the country.\r\n\r\nIn the field where he was supposed legally to have the initiative the\r\nPresident became expressly the agent of the Senate. The Senate laid out\r\nthe limits of policy and the Executive scrupulously, so he said,\r\nobserved those limits.\r\n\r\nThis speech of Mr. Harding's, like his consulting the Senate in advance\r\nupon the reviving of the German treaty, is one of the significant\r\nevidences of the shift of power that is taking place, away from the\r\nExecutive toward the Legislative. It did not attract the attention it\r\ndeserved because our minds are still full of the past when the\r\nPresidency was a great office under Wilson and Roosevelt. We read of Mr.\r\nHarding's going to the hill to tell Congress what it must do, and we\r\nignore the fact that he always does so when Congress sends for him,\r\nacting as their agent.\r\n\r\nThe King still makes his speech to Parliament, though the speech is\r\nwritten by the ministers. They are his ministers, though Parliament\r\nselects them. The power of the King is a convenient fiction. The power\r\nof the President will always remain a convenient fiction, even if it\r\nshould come to have no more substance than that of the King.\r\n\r\nIn truth it has been the Senate not the Executive that has been\r\ndetermining our foreign policy in its broader outlines for more than two\r\nyears. The Secretary of State works out the details. But the Senate says\r\n\"thus far shalt thou go and no farther.\" And when the Secretary of State\r\nhas gone farther, as in the case of the peace treaty with Germany, the\r\nSenate has amended his work. So Senator Penrose did not exaggerate, when\r\nhe said apropos of Mr. Hughes's appointment, \"It makes no difference who\r\nis Secretary of State, the Senate will make the foreign policy.\" The\r\nPresident has only recently declared that it has done so.\r\n\r\nSo gradual has been the extension of the Senate's prerogative that few\r\nrealize how far it has gone. So low had the Senate sunk in public\r\nestimation during the war that it did not occur to President Wilson that\r\nhe might not safely ignore it in making peace. He appointed no Senators\r\nto the delegation which went to Paris. He did not consult the Senate\r\nduring the negotiations nor did he ever take pains to keep the Senate\r\ninformed. He proceeded on the theory that he might sign treaties with\r\nperfect confidence that the Senate would accept them unquestioningly.\r\nAnd so impressed was the country at the time with the power of the\r\nPresidency that Mr. Wilson's tacit assumption of dictatorial power over\r\nCongress was generally taken as a matter of course.\r\n\r\nAll this was changed under Mr. Wilson's successor. One half of Mr.\r\nHarding's delegation to the Washington Conference was made up of\r\nSenators. At every step of the negotiation the Senate's susceptibilities\r\nwere borne in mind. No commitment was entered into which would exceed\r\nthe limits set by the Senate to the involvement of this country abroad.\r\nAlmost daily Mr. President consulted with Senators and explained to them\r\nwhat the American Commission was doing. Practically the Executive became\r\nthe agent of the Senate in foreign relations and in the end he told the\r\nSenate what a good and faithful servant he had been and how scrupulously\r\nhe had respected its will.\r\n\r\nIt was only superficially that Secretary Hughes was the outstanding\r\nfigure of the Conference. The really outstanding figure was the Senate.\r\nMr. Hughes was not free. Mr. Harding was not free. The controlling\r\nfactor was the Senate. The treaties had to be acceptable to the Senate,\r\nwhose views were known in advance. No theory of party authority, of\r\nexecutive domination, would save them if they contravened the Senatorial\r\npolicy disclosed in the Versailles Treaty debate and insisted upon anew\r\nto Mr. Hughes's grievous disappointment when the reservation was\r\nattached to the separate peace with Germany. When it was realized that\r\nSenate opposition to the Four Power Pact had been courted through the\r\ninadvertent guaranty of the home islands of Japan, the agreement was\r\nhastily modified to meet the Senate's views. President and Secretary of\r\nState behaved at this juncture like a couple of clerks caught by their\r\nemployer in a capital error.\r\n\r\nAnd even Mr. Hughes's prominence was half accidental. The Senate is\r\nstrong in position but weak in men. Mr. Hughes is vastly Mr. Lodge's\r\nsuperior in mind, in character, and in personality. Suppose the\r\nsituation reversed, suppose the Senate rich in leadership, suppose it\r\nwere Mr. Aldrich instead of Mr. Lodge who sat with Mr. Hughes in the\r\nCommission, then the Senate which had made the foreign policy in its\r\nbroad outlines would itself have filled in the details, and a Senator\r\ninstead of the Secretary of State would have been the chief figure of\r\nthe American delegation.\r\n\r\nWhere did Mr. Harding's plan of settling international affairs by\r\nconferences originate? You will find it in a document which Senator Knox\r\nbrought out to Marion, Ohio, in January, 1921. Reports had come to\r\nWashington that Mr. Harding's Association of Nations, which was being\r\ndiscussed with the best minds was only Mr. Wilson's league re-cast. The\r\nleaders of the Senate met and agreed on a policy. Mr. Knox took it to\r\nthe President elect. Instead of a formally organized association there\r\nwas to be nothing more than international conferences and the\r\nappointment of international commissions as the occasion for them arose.\r\nMr. Harding's policy is the Senate's policy.\r\n\r\nThe Senate's victory has been complete. The United States did not ratify\r\nthe Versailles Treaty. It did not enter the League of Nations. It did\r\nmake a separate treaty of peace with Germany. It did not appoint a\r\nmember of the Reparations Commission--the Senate's reservation to Mr.\r\nHughes's treaty keeping that question in the control of Congress.\r\n\r\nSenatorial control of foreign relations seems now to be firmly\r\nestablished. No future president, after Mr. Wilson's experiences with\r\nthe Versailles Treaty and Mr. Harding's with the Four Power Pact, will\r\nnegotiate important foreign engagements without informing himself fully\r\nof the Senate's will. And the principle has been established that the\r\nSenate shall be directly represented on American delegations to world\r\nconferences.\r\n\r\nI recall this history of the recent conflict between the Executive and\r\nthe Senate over foreign relations to show how completely in this\r\nimportant field the theory of presidential dominance has broken down and\r\nbeen replaced by the practice of senatorial dominance. No amendment to\r\nthe constitution has taken place. The President still acts \"with the\r\nadvice and consent of the Senate.\" Only now he takes the advice first so\r\nas to be sure of the consent afterward, instead of acting first and\r\nobtaining the advice and consent afterward.\r\n\r\nThe Senate has been aided in this conflict with the Executive by the\r\nconstitutional requirement of a two-thirds majority for the ratification\r\nof a treaty. If a majority would suffice, a President, by invoking the\r\nclaims of party, by organizing public opinion, by judiciously using\r\npatronage might put his agreements with foreign nations through. But a\r\ntwo-thirds vote is not to be obtained by these methods; the only\r\npracticable means is to accept the Senate's views of foreign policy and\r\nconform to it.\r\n\r\nAs soon as foreign relations became sufficiently important to fight over\r\nthe conflict was inevitable and the victory of the Senate certain.\r\n\r\nThe conflict between the two branches of the Government will not stop\r\nwith this victory of the Senate. It has always been present and probably\r\nalways will be. The importance of the domestic problems that the war\r\nleft will cause Congress to insist upon a free hand to make domestic\r\npolicies. In the past Congress busied itself about little except the\r\ndistribution of moneys for public buildings and river and harbor\r\nimprovement. The handling of these funds the legislative branch kept out\r\nof executive control.\r\n\r\nNow public buildings and improvements have become relatively\r\nunimportant. But the deepest economic interests of constituents are\r\ninvolved. Formerly taxes were small and lightly regarded. Today their\r\nincidence is the subject of a sharp dispute between classes and\r\nindustries.\r\n\r\nFurthermore the use of government credit for certain economic ends, such\r\nas those favored by the farmers, will cause a clash between sections,\r\ngroups, industries, and strata of society. Policies of large importance\r\nwill have to be adopted about which there will be a vast difference of\r\nopinion. The divergent interests cannot be represented in the White\r\nHouse, for the Presidency embodies the compromise of all the interests.\r\nThey will have to find their voice in Congress. When they find their\r\nvoice the great policies will be made. And where the great policies will\r\nbe made there the power will be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nCONGRESS AT LAST WITH SOMETHING TO DO HAS NO ONE TO DO IT\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Lazarus was raised from the dead it took him a long time to find\r\nout that he was again alive. His legs were stiff from being so long\r\nextended. His arms were cramped from being decently arranged across his\r\nbreast. The circulation starting in his members produced disagreeable\r\nsensations which recalled his mortal illness and the pains of\r\ndissolution. The last thing that this discomfort suggested was life.\r\n\r\nEven thus it is with Congress, it has been so long dead that it is hard\r\nfor it to realize that it has once again come to life. It suffers from\r\nvarious unpleasant sensations in its members, from blocs, from lack of\r\nleadership, from indifference to party, from factionalism, from\r\nindividualism, from incapacity to do business. They are all vaguely\r\nreminiscent of the pains of dissolution. On the dissolution theory they\r\nare decent and explicable, for death is always decent and explicable.\r\n\r\nAs signs of life they are scandalous, and everybody body is scandalized\r\nover them for fear that a vital Congress will be something new to reckon\r\nwith.\r\n\r\nIf Congress does realize that it has waked from the dead, who will be\r\nworse scandalized than the senile persons whom the newspapers\r\nrespectfully call its \"leaders\"? What more threatening spectacle for\r\nsecond childhood is there than first childhood?\r\n\r\nSuppose Congress were again a lusty and vigorous creature with the blood\r\nof youth in its veins, how long would Henry Cabot Lodge, aged\r\nseventy-two, remain leader of the Senate? Lodge, the irascible old man,\r\nwith worn nerves, who claps his hands for the Senate pages as if they\r\nwere not of the same flesh and blood with himself, and who would, if he\r\ncould follow his instincts, clap his hands in the same way to summon the\r\nmajority Senators, the recluse who is kept alive by old servants who\r\nunderstand and anticipate every whim, to enjoy greedily the petty\r\ndistinctions that have come to him late because the Senate itself was\r\nmore than half dead?\r\n\r\nAnd who would be worse scandalized than the ancient committee chairman,\r\nsome with one foot in the grave? At one time in the first year of Mr.\r\nHarding's administration the important chairmanships in the Senate were\r\ndisposed thus: Finance, the most powerful committee, Senator Penrose, a\r\ndying man; Foreign Relations, Senator Lodge, 72; Interstate Commerce,\r\nSenator Cummins, 72, and broken with illness; Judiciary, Senator\r\nNelson, 79 and living back in the Civil War in which he served as a\r\nprivate; Immigration, Senator Colt, 76.\r\n\r\nSuppose Congress should come to life and represent the real interests of\r\nthe various sections, classes, and, let us say, kinds of property and\r\nbusiness in this country--how long would the Senate remain such a\r\npleasant place to die in?\r\n\r\nWhen these old gentlemen made their successful fight upon President\r\nWilson they signed their own death warrants, and began putting an end to\r\nthe system that made their tenure possible. Only a Congress which had\r\nlong been a subject of public contempt could have fallen into and could\r\nhave remained in their hands. Granted that Congress is negligible, it\r\nmakes no difference who sits in it or how decrepit its leadership.\r\n\r\nBut shift power once more to the legislative, and the various\r\nconflicting interests throughout the country will grasp for the offices\r\nnow in enfeebled hands. And by taking predominance in foreign relations\r\naway from the Executive and transferring it to themselves, the elderly\r\nand infirm \"leaders,\" who have been tolerated out of half contempt, have\r\nstarted the avalanche of authority in their direction. It will sweep\r\nthem off their unsteady feet.\r\n\r\nLet us examine what they have done. When they opposed Mr. Wilson on the\r\nVersailles Treaty they established the power of the Senate to mark out\r\nbroadly the foreign policy of the United States, a dangerous enough\r\nbeginning for persons who were merely tolerated because Congress was\r\nnearly negligible and it was a matter of little difference to the public\r\nwho its managers were. But when they altered Mr. Harding's treaties they\r\nalso denied the authority of the Executive as the head of his party to\r\nalign them in support of his program.\r\n\r\nParty authority vested in the Executive thus impaired, it was not long\r\nbefore the representatives of agricultural states also denied it, and\r\nbegan to take their orders from the Farm Bureau Federation instead of\r\nfrom the White House. Then the House leaders in open defiance of the\r\n\"head of the party\" prepared and reported a soldiers' bonus bill which\r\ncontravened the express purposes of the Executive regarding this\r\nlegislation. Here we have the organization joining with the farm bloc in\r\ndeclaring the legislature to be its own master.\r\n\r\nBut on what do the octogenarian feet of Mr. Lodge and Mr. Cummins, and\r\nMr. Colt and Mr. Nelson, and the others, rest except upon party\r\nauthority? Not upon representing any real or vital principle in the\r\nnational life. Not upon any force of intelligence or personality.\r\n\r\nThey move in a region of fictions. They represent the Republican party,\r\nwhen there is no Republican party, no union on principles, no stable\r\nbody of voters, no discipline, no clear social end to be served.\r\n\r\nWhen votes for legislation must be had, Senator James Watson circulates\r\nabout among the faithless pleading in the name of party loyalty--as well\r\ntalk of fealty to Jupiter in the capitol of the Popes!\r\n\r\nIn extremities the President, as \"head of his party,\" is brought on the\r\nscene,--for all the world like the practice of a certain cult which long\r\nafter its founder was dead used to dress up a lay figure to resemble him\r\nand drive it about the marketplace, to reassure the faithful and confirm\r\nthe influence of the priests. Mr. Harding is alive enough, but the \"head\r\nof his party\" is dead and a mere fiction of priests like \"Jim\" Watson.\r\n\r\nPower has passed or is passing from the Executive and has found no one\r\nin Congress to receive it. The arrival of power causes as much\r\nconsternation on the hill as the outbreak of war does among the\r\nincompetent swivel chair bureaucrats of an army in a nation that has\r\nbeen long at peace.\r\n\r\nPower is passing to Congress because Congress says who shall pay the\r\ntaxes and who may use the public credit. Where there was one interest a\r\ngeneration ago, there are many interests today, each trying to place the\r\nburden of taxation upon others and reaching for the credit itself.\r\nTaxation and credit are the big stakes today and Congress has them in\r\nits atrophied grasp.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SENATOR JAMES E. WATSON OF INDIANA]\r\n\r\nThe question what is the matter with Congress has received more answers\r\nthan any other question asked about American institutions. For almost\r\na generation the national legislature has been regarded as the one\r\ngreat failure in self government. For years it has been the home of\r\nsmall men concerned with petty things which it approached in a petty\r\nspirit, incompetent, wasteful, and hypocritical, a trial to the\r\nExecutive, almost a plague to the country. It has shared with state\r\nlegislatures and municipal boards of aldermen the impatience of the\r\npeople. In spite of searchings of the public conscience it has gone from\r\nbad to worse till it is at its lowest point today, in personnel, in\r\norganization, in capacity to transact business.\r\n\r\nWhat has brought Congress to this state has been the unimportance of its\r\nwork, \"doing such little things,\" as Mr. Root said after his six years\r\nin the Senate. Natural economy prevents the sending of a man on a boy's\r\nerrand even if the man would go.\r\n\r\nThe great power which legislatures have, that over the public purse, has\r\nnot been of enough importance to make Congress a great legislature.\r\nTaxes were light and before the war fell so indirectly that the public\r\ngave them little attention. The control of the budget virtually passed\r\nout of the hands of Congress, for executive departments habitually\r\nexceeded their appropriations and Congress always made up the\r\ndeficiencies. There was no tax upon incomes. Taxpayers were indifferent.\r\nA few hundred millions more or less was of no account.\r\n\r\nDispensations to business in the shape of protective duties upon\r\nimports, a form of taxation which once made Congress a dominant factor\r\nin national life, had become steadily less important as American\r\nindustry grew strong enough to hold its own market against competition\r\nand to compete itself in other markets. With the subsidence of the\r\ntariff as an issue Congress lost its last power to impose taxes in which\r\nthe country was deeply interested. Where the control of the public purse\r\nand taxes are unimportant, legislatures are weak, unless executive\r\nauthority is vested in a Cabinet formed from among their members.\r\n\r\nWith the enfeeblement of Congress through the growing unimportance of\r\nthe taxing power, its great function, came the tendency to magnify the\r\nExecutive. Power has to go somewhere, and it went down Pennsylvania\r\nAvenue. And this movement coincided with the development of\r\ncentralization. Congress, which was full of the spirit of localism, was\r\nnot a perfect instrument of centralization. The Executive was.\r\n\r\nTo elevate the President it was necessary to depress Congress. It became\r\nthe fashion to speak sneeringly of the Legislative branch, to sympathize\r\nwith presidents who \"had Congress on their hands,\" to write of \"the\r\nshame of the Senate,\" and when any issue existed between the two parts\r\nof the government to throw the force of public opinion on the side of\r\nthe executive. The press printed endless criticism of the Senate and\r\nthe House. Theories of government were invented to reduce Congress to a\r\nsubordinate place.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Congress, having regard for the character of its membership,\r\nwas agreed that incompetence should suffer no disabilities. All that was\r\nrequired for political preferment within it was political longevity.\r\n\r\nThe seniority rule, by which committee chairmanships went not to ability\r\nbut to long service, favored mediocrity and second childhood. Even more,\r\nincompetence banded together jealously to protect itself against\r\ncompetence and shunted it into minor assignments. While the public was\r\nregarding Congress with contempt Congress was well satisfied to make\r\nitself contemptible.\r\n\r\nSuppose we had developed a capacity for breeding statesmen in this\r\ncountry, which we have not, would any man of first-class talents seek a\r\npublic career in such an institution as I have described? In the first\r\nplace, the people were visiting Congress with indifference, or worse\r\nthan indifference, and ambition will not serve under indifference. In\r\nthe next place that great power which makes legislatures dominant, the\r\npower to tax and to distribute the fruits of taxation, had become\r\ntemporarily unimportant; and again, Congress itself was organized for\r\nself-protection against brains and character.\r\n\r\nSenator Root quit the Senate in disgust. Senator Kenyon has just\r\nfollowed his example in even deeper disgust. A Tammany Congressman after\r\none term said, \"They tie horses to Congressmen in Washington.\"\r\n\r\nCongress is upon the whole a faithful reflection of the American\r\npolitical consciousness. Democracy is a relatively new thing. It has not\r\ntaken hold of the minds and hearts of men. Shadowy and half-unconscious\r\nfaiths dispute its place. De Gourmont writing of the persistence of\r\nPaganism in Catholicism, says that no religion ever dies but lives on in\r\nits successor. So no government ever dies but lives on in its successor.\r\nWhy take the trouble to govern yourselves when your vital interests are\r\nso well directed by the higher governments, of Progress, of economic\r\nForces, of heroes and captains of industry who ruled by a sort of divine\r\nright? The less you try to muddle through by means of poor human\r\ninstruments in this well-ordered world the better.\r\n\r\nFor the limited tasks of self-government, why should special talents be\r\nrequired? We are still near enough the pioneer age to adhere to pioneer\r\nconceptions. Roosevelt, unfortunately, is the national ideal.\r\n\r\nWe look hopefully for great amateurs like him among insurance agents,\r\nbuilding contractors, lawyers, country editors, bankers, retiring, with\r\nmodest fortunes made, into public life. We put the jack of all trades\r\neverywhere. Into the Presidency--and I don't know why we should not in\r\nthat office, for it is a waste of material and a misdirection of effort\r\nin self-government to throw away a first-class public man on a four-year\r\njob. Into the Senate and the House, into the Cabinet, where a lawyer\r\nwithout previous experience of international affairs conducts our\r\nforeign relations in the most difficult period of the world's history,\r\nmatching the power of his country against the wits of other countries'\r\npracticed representatives, and thus obtaining a certain forbearance of\r\ntheir extreme skill.\r\n\r\nInto the diplomatic posts, where an editor, Colonel Harvey, noted only\r\nfor his audacity, holds the most important ambassadorship. Those who\r\nhave seen the Colonel at meetings of the Supreme Council tell the\r\namazing story that he was a silent and uneasy figure in the conferences\r\nof Mr. Lloyd George and Mr. Briand, perhaps because he is only an\r\nobserver, perhaps also because he was in the company of practiced\r\nstatesmen and diplomats.\r\n\r\nHowever, our system has its compensations. The picture of the robustious\r\nColonel uneasy in Zion is one of them.\r\n\r\nIn another great diplomatic post is Mr. Richard Washburn Child, a\r\nquantity producer of fiction, or sort of literary Henry Ford. In\r\nanother, Paris, the second most important in the world, Mr. Myron\r\nHerrick, a retired business man. Senator Foraker said of him, at a\r\ncritical moment of his public career, \"_De mortuis nil_.\" \"Don't you\r\nwish to finish that quotation, 'nisi bonum,'\" asked the reporter who was\r\nseeking a statement. \"No,\" said the Senator sharply; \"De mortuis nil.\"\r\nOf the ambassador to France nil, except that he comes from Ohio.\r\n\r\nBut when we, given all these causes for the weakness of Congress, the\r\nfrail hold which the idea of self-government has upon the popular mind,\r\nthe unimportance of the taxing power, the tendency to concentrate on the\r\nexecutive at the expense of the legislative, the obstacles to ability\r\nwhich mediocrity has erected in Congress, we have not explained the\r\npresent extraordinary confusion and demoralization in the legislative\r\nbranch. Most of these causes have been operating for some time, yet\r\nCongress has been able to function. Only since Mr. Harding became\r\nPresident has the breakdown of Congress been marked.\r\n\r\nIf you ask observers in Washington why the last Congress failed more\r\ncompletely than any of its predecessors, with one voice they reply:\r\n\"Lack of leadership.\" Everybody cackles of leadership as if lack of\r\nleadership were a cause and not a symptom. What is it that makes a\r\nleader and followers unless it is a common purpose?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REPRESENTATIVE FREDERICK H. GILLETT OF MASSACHUSETTS]\r\n\r\nThe weakness of Mr. Harding, Mr. Lodge, Speaker Gillett, Mr. Mondell\r\nlies partly in themselves, but it is made more apparent by the\r\ndifficulties that confront them. It traces back to the uncertainties\r\nin the national mind. Who could lead representatives of taxpayers\r\nstaggering under the costs of the war and representatives of soldiers\r\nstriving to lay an added burden on the taxpayers? Who could lead\r\nrepresentatives of farmers who demand that a large share of the credit\r\navailable in this country be mobilized by the government for the\r\nsubvention of agriculture and representatives of commerce and\r\nmanufacture who wish to keep the government from competing with them for\r\nthe stock of credit? Or labor which insists that the way to improve\r\nbusiness is by stimulating demand at home through liberal wages,\r\nincreasing consumption; and the other classes which insist that the way\r\nto restore business is by making increased consumption possible to them\r\nthrough lower prices only to be accomplished through lower wages? The\r\nconflict runs across party lines. The old rallying cries fall on deaf\r\nears.\r\n\r\nThe Republican party was based on the common belief that government\r\nfavors delivered at the top percolated down, by a kind of gravity that\r\noperated with rough justice, to all levels of society, like water from a\r\nreservoir on a hill reaching all the homes of a city. When you called\r\nfor loyalty to that you called for loyalty to everybody's stomach,\r\nexpressed in the half-forgotten phrase: \"The full dinner pail.\"\r\n\r\nNow, the various elements of society are doubtful of what may reach them\r\nby the force of gravity from the top. Each insists that government\r\nfavor shall enter at its level and be diffused from that center. Would\r\nyou make the nation happy and rich, give the soldiers a\r\nfive-billion-dollar bonus and start them buying? Give the farmers a\r\nseveral-billion-dollar guarantee of their staples and start prosperity\r\non the farm. Give labor high wages and start prosperity there by\r\nstimulating consumption. Give the consumer lower prices by cutting wages\r\nand start prosperity there. Shift the burden of taxation somewhat from\r\nwealth and start prosperity once more in the good old way by favors at\r\nthe top.\r\n\r\nOne might compare the breakup that has occurred in this country to the\r\nbreakup that took place in Russia after the first revolution, the\r\npeaceful and ineffective revolution of 1905. All parties in Russia\r\nunited against absolutism. A measure of representative government being\r\nestablished and the main object of the revolution being achieved, all\r\nparties fell to quarrelling among themselves as to which should profit\r\nmost by the new institutions.\r\n\r\nUnder Mr. Roosevelt and his successors a mild revolution was\r\naccomplished. People turned against economic absolutism. They had begun\r\nto question the unregulated descent of favors from the top. They doubted\r\nthe force of gravity that used to fill dinner pails. They demanded some\r\nrepresentation in the process of filling dinner pails. They set up a\r\ngovernment at Washington to control credit and transportation.\r\n\r\nAnd now they have fallen apart over who shall pay the taxes, who shall\r\nhave use of the credit, who shall profit by lowered freight rates,\r\nrebates in principle, special favors in transportation, under a new\r\nname.\r\n\r\nWhen men today deplore the lack of leadership they are comparing Mr.\r\nHarding with Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. Wilson, and Mr. Lodge and Mr. Mondell\r\nwith Senator Hanna and Senator Aldrich. Today's chiefs of state are of\r\nsmaller stature. Mr. Harding has been a drifter all his life; he has not\r\nthe native force of Mr. Roosevelt, the sheer vitality which gloried in\r\novercoming obstacles. He has not the will of Mr. Wilson. The petulant\r\nLodge is not the same order of being as the brutal, thick-necked Hanna,\r\nor the more finished but still robust Aldrich.\r\n\r\nBut beyond this personal superiority which the leaders of the past had,\r\nthey enjoyed the advantage of standing upon sure ground. Mr. Hanna\r\nbelonged to that fortunate generation which never doubted, whether it\r\nwas in religion or morals or politics. He may not have put it so to\r\nhimself, but behind everything that he did lay the tacit assumption that\r\nthe business system was divinely ordained. The hand of Providence was\r\nconspicuous everywhere in America's rise, but nowhere more than in the\r\nrapid turning, unprecedented in the world's history, of minerals and\r\nforests into a civilization.\r\n\r\nIn times of daily miracles it is easy to believe. Mr. Hanna believed,\r\nthe public believed, Congress believed. Mr. Hanna spoke for this\r\ndivinely ordained system which was developing an undeveloped continent\r\nas one had never been in the memory of man, making us all richer, with a\r\ncertain rough justice, according to our deserts.\r\n\r\nHe himself was a pioneer. He himself had created wealth. He knew the\r\ncreators of wealth. He delivered the commandments handed down to him on\r\nthe mountain. With God so much on his side a much lesser man than Hanna\r\nwould have been a great leader. God isn't on the side of Mr. Lodge. That\r\nis the difference.\r\n\r\nMr. Aldrich represented a less pure faith. What had been a primitive\r\nreligion had become an established church. He had behind him a power of\r\norganization in business and Congress that Hanna had not. The public may\r\nhave been less faithful; still the religion he represented was the\r\nofficial religion.\r\n\r\nLike Hanna, he was rich and a creator of wealth; in addition he was\r\nconnected by marriage with the richest family in the United States. He\r\nwas the spokesman of business, and even if faith was decaying no one\r\nseriously questioned the sacred character of business as the instrument\r\nof Providence for making America great, rich, and free.\r\n\r\nThe chief aim was the creation of wealth. No one could doubt that the\r\nbusiness organization was accomplishing it with unparalleled success.\r\nPerhaps the heads of the business organization kept a little too much of\r\nthe newly created wealth to themselves, but at least everyone shared in\r\nit and it was wise to let well enough alone. Where there is such\r\nsubstantial unity as existed at that time, no great personal qualities\r\nare required for leadership.\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Aldrich was not endowed with great personal qualities. He has\r\nbeen gone from Washington only a dozen years, and yet no tradition of\r\nhim survives except that he managed the Senate machine efficiently. In\r\ntype he was the business executive. He represented more fully than\r\nanyone else in the Senate the one great interest of the country. He\r\nstood for a reality, and it gave him tremendous power.\r\n\r\nHis mind was one of ordinary range. He traded in tariff schedules and\r\nerected majorities upon the dispensing of favors. He bestowed public\r\nbuildings and river improvements in return for votes. Leaders have not\r\nnow these things to give or have them in insufficient quantities and on\r\ntoo unimportant a scale.\r\n\r\nNo great piece of constructive legislation serves to recall him.\r\nPrimarily a man of business, he nevertheless attached his name to the\r\ngrotesque Aldrich-Vreeland currency act. The work of the monetary\r\ncommission of which he was the head, and which led to the present\r\nFederal Reserve Law, was the work of college professors and economists.\r\n\r\nNaturally a better leader than Mr. Lodge because he met men more easily\r\nupon a common ground and had more vitality than the Massachusetts\r\nSenator has, he was no better leader than any one of half a dozen\r\npresent Senators would be if the aim of business were accepted today by\r\nthe country as the great social aim, as it was in his day, and if any\r\none of the six now spoke for business in the Senate as in his time he\r\ndid.\r\n\r\nGive Mr. Brandegee or Mr. Lenroot or Mr. Wadsworth a people accepting\r\nthat distribution which worked out from extending to the heads of the\r\nbusiness organization every possible favor and immunity, as the\r\ndistribution best serving the interests of all, and add unto him plenty\r\nof public buildings and river improvements, and he could lead as well as\r\nMr. Aldrich.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nINTERLUDE. INTRODUCING A FEW MEMBERS OF THE UPPER HOUSE BOOBOISIE AND\r\nSOME OTHERS\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a saying that in American families there is only three or four\r\ngenerations from riches to shirt sleeves. Mr. Hanna is the first\r\ngeneration, Mr. Aldrich is the second generation. In Mr. Penrose and Mr.\r\nLodge you reach what is a common phase of American family history, the\r\neccentric generation. And in Senator Jim Watson and Senator Charles\r\nCurtis, who are just coming on the scene as \"leaders,\" you reach once\r\nmore political shirt sleeves.\r\n\r\nThe American family dissipating its patrimony, produces invariably the\r\nson who is half contemptuous of the old house that founded his fortunes,\r\nwho is half highbrow, who perhaps writes books as well as keeping them,\r\nor it may be bolts to the other side altogether.\r\n\r\nSo the Hanna-Aldrich stock produced Henry Cabot Lodge, a sort of\r\npolitical James Hazen Hyde, who stayed at home and satisfied his longing\r\nfor abroad by serving on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. But\r\nperhaps it would be fairer to Mr. Lodge to say of him what a witty\r\nfriend of mine did, \"Lodge is what Henry James would have been if Henry\r\nJames had remained in America and gone into politics.\" Or he is what\r\nHenry Adams might have been if Henry Adams had been less honest in his\r\ncontempt for democracy.\r\n\r\nThe last leaf of that New England tree whose fruit was an expatriate\r\nliterature and expatriate lives, the limit of Mr. Lodge's expatriation\r\nwas an interest in foreign affairs when redder-blooded Americans were\r\nhappily ignorant of them. If business had been choosing spokesmen at\r\nWashington it would no more have picked out Mr. Lodge than it would have\r\npicked out James Hazen Hyde or Henry James. Mr. Lodge's leadership was a\r\nsign of decay.\r\n\r\nBut some will say business at this time had Senator Penrose as its\r\nspokesman. I doubt it. Senator Penrose was that other son of the family\r\nin whose blood runs all the ancestral energies without the ancestral\r\nrestraint.\r\n\r\nBy the time he achieved prominence business in politics was no longer\r\nquite respectable. People said, creating the Penrose legend, \"Why,\r\nPenrose would stop at nothing. He'd even represent the selfish interests\r\nhere in Washington.\" Therefore it was considered that he must represent\r\nthem. And he did to an extent, speaking for Henry C. Frick and some\r\nothers of Pennsylvania, but he was in no adequate sense the successor\r\nof Aldrich and Hanna.\r\n\r\nHad business chosen a spokesman at Washington, he must have been\r\nrespectable. Hanna was that most respectable of Americans, the highly\r\nsuccessful man who has played for and won a great fortune. Aldrich was\r\nthat equally respectable American, the conservative manager of the\r\nestablished corporation.\r\n\r\nThere is a story that when Penrose became boss of Pennsylvania the\r\nRepublican politicians of the State were anxious about the effect his\r\npersonal reputation would have upon the voters. Finally they went to\r\nhim, as the elders sometimes go to the young parson, and said, \"The\r\norganization thinks the people would like it better if you were\r\nmarried,\" \"All right, boys, if you think so,\" Penrose replied; \"let the\r\norganization pick the gal.\" The organization recoiled from this\r\ncynicism. But business is harder. Business, if it had really identified\r\nitself with Penrose, would have \"picked the gal.\"\r\n\r\nNo better evidence of the tenuity of his connection with business is\r\nrequired than his outbreak in 1920, \"I won't have the international\r\nbankers write the platform and nominate the candidate at Chicago.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Penrose enjoyed a \"_succes de scandale_.\" He was what the hypocrites\r\nin Washington secretly desired to be but lacked the courage to be. He\r\nlived up to the aristocratic tradition, at its worst; which everyone\r\nadmires, especially at its worst. He did on a grand scale what anyone\r\nelse would have been damned for doing on a lesser scale and was loved\r\nfor being so splendidly shocking.\r\n\r\nHe was the village sport, with the best blood of the village in his\r\nveins, and was the village delight, the man about whom all the best\r\nstories were whispered. He had the clear mind which comes from scorn of\r\npretense. But all this is not greatness, nor is it leadership. The\r\nRepublicans in the Senate before being led by Mr. Penrose would have\r\ninsisted on \"picking the gal.\" They like to see framed marriage\r\ncertificates in the party household.\r\n\r\nThe patrimony is gone and we reach shirt sleeves in Senator Charles\r\nCurtis and Senator James Watson, one of whom will succeed Mr. Lodge when\r\nhe dies, retires, or is retired, and the other of whom will succeed Mr.\r\nCummins as president pro tem when he similarly disposes of himself or is\r\ndisposed of.\r\n\r\nNeither of them has the stature or solidity of Hanna or Aldrich, and\r\nthey will not have supporting them unity in party or in national\r\nsentiment. Neither of them has the romantic quality of Mr. Penrose or\r\nMr. Lodge. Neither of them will ever be a leader in any real sense of\r\nthe word. Neither of them will have anything to lead.\r\n\r\nAs frequently happens when you reach shirt sleeves by the downward\r\nroute, you find the accumulative instinct reasserting itself on a petty\r\nscale. Look at the rather shabby clothes that Senator Curtis wears, in\r\nspite of his considerable wealth, and you are sure that you have to do\r\nwith a hoarder. And that is what he is; a hoarder of political minutiae.\r\n\r\nCurrent report is that he is the best poker player in either house of\r\nCongress. You can imagine him sitting across the table watching the\r\nfaces of his antagonists with a cold eye, which no tremor of a muscle,\r\nno faint coming or going of color, no betraying weakness escapes.\r\n\r\nThat is his forte in politics, knowing all the little things about men\r\nwhich reveal their purposes or operate in unexpected ways as hidden\r\nmotives.\r\n\r\nHe has a perfect card catalogue of nearly all the voters of Kansas. It\r\nis kept up to date. It reports not merely names and addresses but\r\npersonal details, the voter's point of view, what interests him, what\r\ninfluences may be brought to bear on him. Curtis is a hoarder, with an\r\namazing capacity for heaping up that sort of information.\r\n\r\nHis mind is a card catalogue of the Senate, vastly more detailed than\r\nthe card catalogue of Kansas. He watches the Senate as he watches the\r\nfaces of his antagonist in a poker game. He knows the little\r\nunconsidered trifles which make men vote this way and that. And he is so\r\nobjective about it all that he rarely deceives himself. If into this\r\nconcern with the small motives which move men there crept a certain\r\ncontempt of humanity he might mislead himself; he might be hateful, too;\r\nbut his objectivity saves him; he is as objective as a card catalogue\r\nand no more hateful.\r\n\r\nBut you see how far short all this falls from leadership, or\r\nstatesmanship, or greatness of any description. Usefulness is there\r\ncertainly; card catalogues are above all useful, especially when there\r\nis variety and diversity to deal with, as there is coming to be in a\r\nSenate ruled by blocs and frequented by undisciplined individualism.\r\n\r\nIf Curtis kept a journal he would hand down to posterity a most perfect\r\npicture of men and motives in Washington,--if, again, posterity should\r\nbe interested in the fleeting and inconsiderable figures who fill the\r\nnational capital \"in this wicked and adulterous generation seeking for a\r\nsign\"--I am quoting the Bible trained Secretary of State in one of his\r\npetulant moments.\r\n\r\nIf he had the malice of Saint Simon, the journal would be diverting, but\r\nhe is without malice. He has no cynical conception of men's weakness and\r\nsmallness as something to play upon. He accepts Senators as they are,\r\nsympathetically. What makes them vote this way and that is the major\r\nconsideration of politics. His records of the Kansas electorate are more\r\nimportant to him than principles, policies, or morals. The efficient\r\nelection district Captain of the Senate, that is Curtis.\r\n\r\nA more likely successor to Lodge is \"Jim\" Watson of Indiana. I attended\r\na theatrical performance in Washington recently. Nearby sat the Indiana\r\nSenator. His neighbor, whom I did not recognize, doubtless some\r\npolitician from Indiana, sat with his arm about Watson's neck, before\r\nthe curtain rose, pouring confidences into Watson's ear.\r\n\r\nWatson is given to public embraces. His arm falls naturally about an\r\ninterlocutor's shoulders or, and this is important as showing that Jim\r\nis not merely patronizing, descending affectionately from the great\r\nheights of the Senatorship, Jim himself, as at the theatre, is the\r\nobject of the embrace. But perhaps that is finer condescension.\r\n\r\nIf the characteristic gesture of Lodge is the imperious clapping of his\r\nhands for the Senate pages and the revealing trait of Curtis is\r\nextraordinary intuition about the cards in other hands around the\r\nlamp-lit table, the soul of Watson is in the embrace. His voice is a\r\ncaress. He kisses things through. He never errs in personal relations,\r\nif you like to be embraced--and most men do, by greatness.\r\n\r\nIn one of his less successful moments he represented, at Washington the\r\nNational Manufacturers' Association, at that time a rather shady\r\norganization of lesser business men. If he had not been the orator that\r\nhe is he would have been with that circumambulatory arm of his, an\r\ninevitable lobbyist.\r\n\r\nFor Watson is an orator, of the old school, the Harding school. They\r\nemploy the same loose style of speech, flabby as unused muscles, words\r\nthat come into your head because you have often heard them on the stump\r\nand in the Senate, and read them in country editorials, words that have\r\nlong lost their precise meaning but evoke the old pictures in the minds\r\nof an emotional and unthinking electorate. At this art of emitting a\r\nlong rumble of speech which is not addressed to the mind Watson has no\r\nequal.\r\n\r\nIt is an American art and puzzling to foreigners. Vice-Admiral Kato, not\r\nthe head of the Japanese delegation but the second Kato, had enough\r\nEnglish to remark it. \"Your President,\" he said, \"is a charming man, but\r\nwhy does he put such funny things in his speeches?\"\r\n\r\nIn the mere mastery of this kind of English Mr. Harding may equal\r\nWatson, but as an orator the Indianian has what the President never had;\r\nthe unctuous quality in him which makes him embrace readily lets him\r\npour out his soul freely. He has thunders in his voice, he tosses his\r\nhead with its fuzzy hair magnificently, he has gusto. He has\r\nimagination. He is a big, lovable if not wholly admirable, boy playing\r\nat oratory, playing at statesmanship, playing above all at politics.\r\nNothing is very real to him, not even money; he put all he had into an\r\nirrigation project and left it there. Just now he irrigates with the\r\ntears in his voice the arid places in the Republican party where\r\nloyalty should grow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SENATOR JOSEPH S FRELINGHUYSEN OF NEW JERSEY]\r\n\r\nI present these characterizations of Senate leaders, past, present, and\r\nfuture, to indicate through them what the Senate itself is, and to\r\nsuggest what conditions have given quite ordinary men power and how\r\nfeeble leadership has become, with the country no longer agreed how best\r\nto promote the general good, and with Congress as it has been in recent\r\nyears a relatively unimportant factor in the national government.\r\n\r\nSenator Platt used to say of an habitual candidate for nomination to the\r\ngovernorship of New York, Timothy L. Woodruff, \"Well, it may taper down\r\nto Tim.\" We have \"tapered down to Tim,\"--or rather to \"Jim\"--in the\r\nSenate because as a people we have been indifferent and unsure, and\r\nbecause there has been little use for anything but \"Tims\" or \"Jims\" in\r\nWashington. Nature seems to abhor a waste in government.\r\n\r\nThose who ascribe all the troubles in Congress to lack of leadership,\r\nand go no further, blame the poverty of our legislative life upon the\r\npopular election of Senators and upon the choice of candidates at direct\r\nprimaries. But the decay began before the system changed. We resorted to\r\nnew methods of nomination and election because the old methods were\r\ngiving us Lorimers and Addickses. Probably we gained nothing, but we\r\nlost little.\r\n\r\nBig business, so long as the taxing power, through the imposition of\r\nthe tariff, was important to it, and so long as it was accepted as the\r\none vital interest of the country, saw to it that it was effectively\r\nrepresented in Congress. It was then somebody's job to see that at least\r\nsome solid men went to Washington. It has of late been nobody's job.\r\nThere has been no real competition for seats in the national\r\nlegislature.\r\n\r\nThe Senate has tempted small business men who can not arise to the level\r\nof national attention through their control of industry, and small\r\nlawyers similarly restricted in their efforts for publicity. It is an\r\neasily attained national stage.\r\n\r\nIt appeals to that snobbish instinct--of wives sometimes--which seeks\r\nsocial preferment not to be obtained in small home towns, or denied\r\nwhere family histories are too well known.\r\n\r\nIt allures the politician, bringing opportunity to play the favorite\r\ngame of dispensing patronage and delivering votes, with the added pomp\r\nof a title.\r\n\r\nIt is the escape of the aristocrat, whose traditions leave him the\r\nchoice between idleness and what is called \"public service.\"\r\n\r\nIt is the escape of the successful man who has found his success empty\r\nand tries to satisfy the unsatisfied cravings of his nature. Such men\r\n\"retire\" into it, as it was reported to President Harding's indignation\r\nthat one of the Chicago banker candidates for the Secretaryship of the\r\nTreasury wished to retire into the Cabinet. Some enter it for one of\r\nthese motives, more from a combination of them, but, generally, it is\r\nthe promised land of the bored, some of whom find it only a mirage.\r\n\r\nA typical Senator is Mr. Frelinghuysen of New Jersey, one of the smaller\r\nbusiness men being drawn into public life. Son of a country minister, he\r\nstarted as an insurance agent. Nature equipped him with unusual energy\r\nand aggressiveness and those two qualities brought success in writing\r\ninsurance. Nothing in his early training inhibited his robust\r\ntemperament. Ruddy and vigorous, he is not sicklied o'er with any pale\r\ncast whatever. Plainly he has a zest for life, that easily accessible\r\nAmerican life where good mixers abound.\r\n\r\nNot a highbrow, he yet recognizes that literature has its place, on all\r\nfour walls of a large room, and bought in sets.\r\n\r\nHaving the American horror of loneliness, whether social or moral, you\r\nfind him always going along with his party. When his set divides he\r\nbalances between the two factions as long as possible and elects to go\r\nwith the more numerous. Simple, likable, honest, safe so long as\r\nmajorities are safe, and that is the theory we are working on, he is the\r\naverage man in everything but his aggressiveness and energy.\r\n\r\nNo, he also rises above the average in possessing such a name as\r\nFrelinghuysen. You enter his library and you see a banner of the\r\ncampaign of Clay and Frelinghuysen. He will recite to you campaign\r\nsongs of those unsuccessful candidates for President and Vice-President.\r\nAnother Frelinghuysen was a Cabinet member. Another Frelinghuysen, of\r\nthe wealthier branch of the family, has an assured social position.\r\n\r\nNone of these famous Frelinghuysens is an ancestor. Each of them is a\r\nchallenge. If he could have found an ancestor! If an insurance company\r\nwere a high place from which to survey the world at one's feet! But, no!\r\nAncestors, power, publicity, social prestige, all lie beyond the reach\r\nof small business success.\r\n\r\nIn the Senate men, important men, come to you for favors; it is so much\r\nbetter than going to them to write policies. From the Senatorship you\r\ncondescend; there really is a world to which a Senator can condescend.\r\nWashington is a social melting pot. No one asks whether you are one of\r\nthe Blanks. You are Senator Blank and that is enough. And if you are so\r\nfortunate, by your very averageness, to attach yourself to the average\r\nman whose fortune makes him President, and you become one of the Harding\r\nSenators, one of the intimates, you are lifted up: like Bottom, you are\r\ntranslated. You are the familiar of greatness.\r\n\r\nAs a legislator you deal with policies, international and domestic, in\r\nthe realm of ideas--as when you sit in your library, four square with\r\nall the wisdom of the ages.\r\n\r\nIf you have enough of the boy about you, like Frelinghuysen, you enjoy\r\nall this hugely. You have projected your ego beyond the limits of the\r\ninsurance business. You look among the branches of the Frelinghuysen\r\nfamily tree without losing countenance. Who knows that there won't be\r\nanother \"and Frelinghuysen\" ticket, this time a successful one?\r\n\r\nNot every senator has escaped so nearly from the failures which attend\r\nsuccess as has Frelinghuysen. Nor is his escape complete. A sense of\r\nunreality haunts him. Aggressiveness in his case covers it, as it so\r\noften does a feeling of weakness. After he has blustered through some\r\nutterance, he will buttonhole you and ask, \"Did I make a damn fool of\r\nmyself? Now, the point I was trying to make was, etc. Did I get it\r\nclear? Or did I seem like a damn fool?\"\r\n\r\nLess agile minded than Senator Edge, he watches the motions of his New\r\nJersey colleague as a fascinated bird watches those of a snake or a cat.\r\nIntellectually he is not at ease, even in the Senate.\r\n\r\nAnother of the Harding set is Harry New of Indiana, one of the \"Wa'al\r\nnaow\" school of statesmen, in dress and speech the perfect county\r\nchairman of the stage. The broad-brimmed black felt hat, winter and\r\nsummer, has withstood all the insidious attacks of fashion. The nasal\r\nvoice has equally resisted all the temptations to conformity with the\r\nsofter tones which are now everywhere heard. In politics one has to be\r\nregular, and New has the impulse to individuality, which with Borah and\r\nLaFollette manifests itself in political isolation. With New it\r\nmanifests itself in hat and speech. New thus remains a person, not\r\nmerely a clothes-horse which is recorded \"aye\" when Mr. Lodge votes\r\n\"aye\" and \"no\" when Mr. Lodge votes \"no.\" But this is hardly fair. Mr.\r\nNew has been irregular in other ways. He has not made money; he has lost\r\nit, a fortune in a stone quarry. He is indifferent to it. This marks him\r\nas a person. He would rather whip a stream for trout than go after\r\ndollars with a landing net.\r\n\r\nWhipping a stream for trout is the clue to Harry New. If you are a\r\nfisherman you impute all sorts of wiles to the fish. You match your wits\r\nagainst the sharp wits under the water, and your ego is fortified when,\r\nthe day being dark and your hand being cunning, you land a mess from the\r\nstream. The world is a trout stream to New. The hat and the nasal accent\r\nare the good old flies that Isaak Walton recommended.\r\n\r\nThere is the type of mind which sees craft where others see simplicity.\r\nWe associate shrewdness with the kind of hat New wears and the kind of\r\nvoice he has preserved against the seductions of politeness. It is one\r\nof our rural traditions. Suppose shrewdness that asks no more than\r\nconversation and a small mess of fish. It is delightful. As we listen to\r\nit arriving after the most penetrating exposition at the same\r\nconclusions which we have reached directly and stupidly, we are\r\nflattered. We realize that we, too, are shrewd, unconsciously so, as,\r\nwasn't it Moliere's bourgeois gentleman, who learned that he was\r\nunconsciously a gentleman, since he had been doing all his life some of\r\nthe things that gentlemen did?\r\n\r\nA playboy of the western plains, New would be happier if his colleague,\r\nJim Watson, did not also take himself seriously as a politician. \"Jim,\"\r\nsays New, \"is an orator, a great orator, but he ought to let politics\r\nalone; as a politician he is, like all orators a child.\"\r\n\r\nNew is no orator. A fair division would be for Watson to be the orator\r\nand New the politician. But no one is ready to admit that he is no\r\npolitician. For New politics is craft; for Watson it is embraces. At a\r\ndinner in Indiana, New contrived to have his rival for the senatorship,\r\nBeveridge, and the politically outlawed Mayor of Indianapolis, Lew\r\nShank, not invited. Watson would have led them both in with an arm\r\naround the neck of each. That individualism which makes New preserve the\r\nhat and the accent makes him punish foes, or is it that the sense of\r\nbeing \"close to Harding\" robs him of discretion?\r\n\r\nIn the board of aldermen of any large city you will find a dozen\r\nCalders, local builders or contractors, good fellows who have the gift\r\nof knowing everyone in their districts, who by doing little favors here\r\nand there get themselves elected to the municipal legislature; they see\r\nthat every constituent gets his street sign and sidewalk encumbrance\r\npermits, interview the police in their behalf when necessary, and the\r\nbright young men who compose the traditional humor of the daily press\r\nrefer to them gaily as \"statesmen.\"\r\n\r\nThe art of being a Senator like Calder is the art of never saying \"no.\"\r\nHe is worth mentioning because he has the bare essentials of\r\nsenatorship, the habit of answering all letters that come to him, the\r\npractice of introducing by request all bills that anyone asks to have\r\nintroduced, industry in seeking all jobs and favors that anyone comes to\r\nhim desiring.\r\n\r\nHe \"goes to the mat\" for everybody and everything. He shakes everybody's\r\nhand. He is a good news source to representatives of the local press and\r\nis paid for his services in publicity. New York is populous and sent\r\nmany soldiers to the late war. Nevertheless, the mother or father of a\r\nsoldier from that state who did not receive a personal letter from\r\nCalder must have eluded the post office.\r\n\r\nHe votes enthusiastically for everything that everybody is for. He is\r\nunhappy when he has to take sides on sharply debated issues. Morality is\r\na question of majorities. He finds safety in numbers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SENATOR HARRY S. NEW OF INDIANA]\r\n\r\nNature was not kind to Calder; it left him with no power to throw a\r\nbluff. He is plainly what he is. He has neither words nor manner. His\r\ncolleagues look down on him a little. But most of them are after all\r\nonly Calder plus, and plus, generally speaking, not so very much. He is\r\nthe Senator reduced to the lowest terms.\r\n\r\nCalder is timid, more timid than Frelinghuysen with his eternal\r\nbuttonholing you to ask what impression he has made, more timid than\r\nanyone except Kellogg of Minnesota. The latter is in a constant state of\r\nflutter. Little and wisplike physically he seems to blow about with\r\nevery breeze of politics. He is so unsure that his nerves are always on\r\nedge, in danger of breaking. When he was balancing political\r\nconsequences over nicely during the League of Nations discussion,\r\nEx-President Taft said to him impatiently: \"The trouble with you, Frank,\r\nis that you have no guts.\" Kellogg straightened up all his\r\ninches--physically he is a white-haired and bent Will H. Hays--and\r\nreplied, \"I allow no man to say that to me.\" He fluttered out, and Mr.\r\nTaft being kind-hearted followed him to apologize.\r\n\r\nIf you could analyze the uneasiness of Mr. Kellogg you would understand\r\nthe fear which haunts the minds of all Senators. Mr. Kellogg comes to\r\nWashington after an enormously successful career at the bar. He is rich.\r\nHe is respected. His place in society is secure. What would the loss of\r\nthe senatorship mean to such a man? He ought to have all the confidence\r\nwhich is supposed to be in the man who rises in the world, all that\r\nwhich comes from an established position. Unlike most great lawyers who\r\nretire into the Senate, Mr. Kellogg does not merely interest himself in\r\nconstitutional questions, like a child with molasses on its fingers\r\nplaying with feathers. He is industrious. He interests himself in the\r\nSenate's business. He develops nice scruples which can not be brushed\r\naside. He wears himself out over them. He hesitates. He trembles. The\r\ncertainty with which his mind must have operated in the field of legal\r\nprinciples deserts him in the field of political expediency. Or perhaps\r\nit is that he sees both principles and expediency and can not choose\r\nbetween the two.\r\n\r\nWadsworth of New York is an exception to the general run of Senators. He\r\nbelongs by birth to the class which is traditionally free from\r\nhypocrisy. He is not boisterously contemptuous of the slavishness of\r\nSenators as Penrose was. He is quietly contemptuous. His voice has a\r\nnote of well-bred impatience in it. He has not Penrose's pleasure in\r\nmere shocking, but he has the aristocratic hatred of moral ostentation.\r\nThe kind of thing that is not done is the kind of thing that is not\r\ndone. You don't do it and make no parade of your abstinence. Wadsworth\r\ndoes not open his home to all his New York colleagues in both houses\r\njust because it is politically expedient. His house is his own, and\r\nso is his conscience, which is not surrendered at the demands of woman\r\nsuffrage or of the dries. He has courage. He has convictions. He is\r\nlonely. To be otherwise than lonely in the Senate you must be a\r\nFrelinghuysen, an Elkins, a Newberry, a New, a Watson, or a Hale. He\r\nwill never be a leader. He has no more place in the Senate as it is than\r\nLord Robert Cecil, a much larger man, has in the House of Commons as it\r\nis. Both belong to another day and generation. Neither is sure of\r\nanything but himself and each counts the world well lost. Both represent\r\nthe aristocratic tradition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SENATOR JAMES W. WADSWORTH OF NEW YORK]\r\n\r\nIndustry makes Reed Smoot one of the most useful of the Senators. He has\r\na passion for details. He reads all the bills. He makes himself a master\r\nof the Government's appropriations and expenditures. He exudes figures\r\nfrom every pore. By temperament Mr. Smoot is unhappy, and he finds cause\r\nof dark foreboding in the mounting costs of government. His voice has a\r\nscolding note. His manner and appearance is that of a village elder. His\r\nheart is sore as he regards the political world about him, its\r\nwastefulness, its consumption of white paper, on leaves to print and on\r\nreports which no one reads. He is the aggrieved parent. \"My children,\"\r\nhe seems always to say, \"you must mend your ways.\" He specializes in\r\nmisplaced commas. Nothing is too trivial for his all seeing eyes. In\r\ncommittee he talks much, twice as much as anyone else, about points\r\nwhich escape the attention of all his colleagues. Senators, wishing to\r\nget through no matter how, regard him as a pest. Only an unimaginative\r\nand uncreative mind can occupy itself as Smoot's does. He is a building\r\ninspector rather than a builder. With his fussiness, his minor prophetic\r\nvoice, his holier-than-thou attitude toward waste, he can never be a\r\nleader of the Senate to which the idle apprentice, the good fellow, who\r\ndines out much in the Harding Senatorial set, the small business man\r\nseeking a place in society, give its tone and character.\r\n\r\nOne can not present a complete gallery of the Senate in the space of a\r\nsingle chapter. I have chosen a few characteristic figures, the leaders\r\npast, present, and to come, the small business man who seeks social\r\npreferment or the destruction of a title in Washington, such as Calder\r\nand Frelinghuysen, the politician who likes to play the game better in\r\nthe Capitol than at home, like New, the aristocrat who escapes from the\r\nboredom of doing nothing into the boredom of a democratic chamber, the\r\ngradgrind legislator of whom there are few like Smoot, the half party\r\nman, half bloc man like Capper.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SENATOR WILLIAM M. CALDER OF NEW YORK]\r\n\r\nAll of these men belong to a party and are limited by that party's\r\nweakness, its lack of principles, the caution which it has to use in\r\navoiding the alienation of its loosely held supporters. The party\r\nprogram is something on which all kinds of people can stand. Necessarily\r\nthe party men in the Senate are tied down to a cause that is largely\r\nnegative. They can not be other than feeble and ineffective figures.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of parties has led to the emergence of a few outstanding\r\nindividual Senators who must be examined to see whether around them the\r\nnew Senate which will come with the shift of power and responsibility to\r\nthe legislative branch can be built. The most brilliant and interesting\r\nof them is Senator Borah, but it is significant that the farm bloc\r\nlooking for a leader did not turn to him, but chose rather much less\r\nsignificant and effective men.\r\n\r\nYet the Idaho Senator seems the natural rallying point for any movement\r\nwhich will give new life and force to the Senate. He is established. He\r\nis the most potent single individual in the upper house. So far as there\r\nis any opposition to President Harding and his friends, Mr. Borah is\r\nthat opposition. His is the intelligence which inspires the Democratic\r\nparty when it consents to be inspired by intelligence. He believes that\r\nthe revolution has come, not one of street fighting and bomb throwing\r\nbut a peaceful change which has made the old parties meaningless,\r\ndestroyed the old authorities and set men free for the new grouping that\r\nis to take place. Others in the Senate see this and are frightened.\r\nBorah sees it and is glad. His bonds are loosed and he is a vastly\r\nbraver, sincerer and more effective Senator than ever before.\r\n\r\nIt is absurd to use the word radical of Borah, Johnson, or LaFollette,\r\nfor none of them is truly radical; but if one must do so for the lack of\r\nany better term, then Borah is the conservatives' radical. The angriest\r\nreactionary remains calm when his name is mentioned, perhaps because\r\nBorah never gets into a passion himself and never addresses himself to\r\npopular prejudice. He is not a mob orator. He is impersonal in his\r\nappeals. No one any longer suspects him of an ambition to be President.\r\nHe seems, like a hermit, to have divorced himself from the earthly\r\npassions of politics and to have become pure intellect operating in the\r\nrange of public affairs. He is almost a sage while still a Senator.\r\n\r\nIf we had the custom of electing our Ex-Presidents to the Senate, you\r\ncan imagine one of them, beyond the average of intelligence, freed from\r\nambition through having filled the highest office, occupying a place\r\nlike that of Borah.\r\n\r\nBorah perhaps likes it too well ever to descend into the market place\r\nand become a leader. His is an enviable lot, for he is the most nearly\r\nfree man in Washington; why should he exchange the immunity he possesses\r\nfor a small group of followers? Besides he believes in the power of\r\noratory rather than in the power of organization. He said to me at the\r\nRepublican Convention of 1916, \"I could stampede this crowd for\r\nRoosevelt.\" The crowd was thoroughly organized against Roosevelt.\r\n\r\nNature made him an orator, one of the greatest in the country. And he\r\nhas come to be satisfied with the gift he has. The unimportance of his\r\nstate, Idaho, has freed him from any illusions about himself with\r\nrespect to the Presidency. The habit of carrying a comb in his vest\r\npocket marks him as free from the social ambitions which number more\r\nvictims in the Senate than the ambition for the presidency. He is almost\r\na disembodied spirit politically, of the revolution he discerns he will\r\nbe a spectator.\r\n\r\nHiram Johnson is a declining figure. I see no reason to modify the\r\nconclusion which was reached about him in the _Mirrors of Washington_,\r\nthat he thought more of men than of principles and especially of one\r\nman, Johnson. The test of his sincerity came when the vote was reached\r\non the unseating of Senator Newberry for spending too much money in the\r\nMichigan primaries.\r\n\r\nJohnson's great issue a year before had been sanctity of popular\r\nnominations. Yet when he had an opportunity to speak and act against a\r\nbrazen even though foolish attempt to buy a nomination, he was rushing\r\nwildly across the continent, arriving after the vote had been taken.\r\n\r\nOn reaching Washington, he called his newspaper friends before him to\r\nexplain the difficulties and delays that had made him late. When he had\r\nfinished a nasal voice from the press remarked, \"Senator, there will be\r\ngreat public sympathy with you as a victim of the railroads. But the\r\npeople will only know how great their loss has been if you will tell\r\nthem now how you would have voted if you had been here.\" Johnson\r\nadjourned the meeting hastily without a reply.\r\n\r\nThe absence from the roll call and the theatrical attempt to make it\r\nappear accidental were typical. Johnson had won the Michigan primaries\r\nin the national campaign of 1920. The delegates were in control of\r\nNewberry's political friends. They remained firm for Johnson throughout\r\nthe balloting. Johnson avoided voting against their leader although his\r\nprinciples required that he should lead the fight for his unseating.\r\n\r\nJohnson has always over-emphasized Johnson. At the Progressive\r\nconvention in 1912 when Roosevelt was nominated for the Presidency and\r\nJohnson for the Vice-Presidency, it was proposed, since both were in\r\nattendance, to bring both on the stage and introduce them to the\r\ndelegates. The natural order was Roosevelt first, since he was the\r\nnominee for President and since he was, moreover, one of the most\r\ndistinguished figures in the world, and Johnson, since he had second\r\nplace, second. But Johnson would go second to no man. Either he must\r\nshow himself on the stage first or not at all. Finally it was\r\ncompromised by presenting them together at the same moment, holding\r\nhands upon the platform.\r\n\r\nJohnson can never see himself in proper perspective. At the Progressive\r\nconvention he was more important than Roosevelt. In the Newberry case\r\nhis political fortunes were more important than honest primaries.\r\n\r\nSenator Reed of Missouri is possessed of a devil. He is a satirist\r\nturned politician. He has the _saeva indignatio_ of Swift. American life\r\nwith its stupidity, its facile optimism, its gullibility, its easy\r\ncompromises, its hypocrisy, fills him with rage. His face is shot red\r\nwith passion. His voice is angry. He is a defeated idealist left in this\r\nbarren generation without an ideal. He might have been led away by the\r\nwar as so many were, as Wilson was, into the belief that out of its\r\nsufferings would come a purified and elevated humanity. But Reed is hard\r\nto lead away. Where other men see beauty and hope he searches furiously\r\nfor sham. Where other men say cheerfully half a loaf is better than no\r\nbread he puts the half loaf on the scales and proves that it is short\r\nweight.\r\n\r\nAn old prosecuting attorney, he believes that guilt is everywhere. He is\r\nalways out for a conviction. If the evidence is insufficient he uses all\r\nthe arts, disingenuous presentations, appeals to prejudice, not because\r\nhe is indifferent to justice but because the accused ought to be hanged\r\nanyway, and he is not going to let lack of evidence stand in the way of\r\nthat salutary consummation.\r\n\r\nHe conducts a lifelong and passionate fight against the American\r\npractice of \"getting away with it.\" Shall Hoover get away with it as a\r\ngreat and pure man, the benefactor of the race! Not while Jim Reed has\r\nbreath in his body! Here is an American idol, tear it down, exhibit its\r\nclay feet! Shall Wilson \"get away with it,\" with his League of Nations\r\nand his sublimated world set free from all the baser passions of the\r\npast? Not while any acid remains on Jim Reed's tongue!\r\n\r\nReed is sincere. He hates sham. He nevertheless himself uses sham to\r\nfight sham. He is the nearest thing to a great satirist this country has\r\ndeveloped. And the amazing consideration is that in a nation which\r\ndislikes satire a satirist should be elected by the suffrage of his\r\nfellows.\r\n\r\nProbably it is only in politics that we tolerate satire. In\r\nself-government we only half believe. We are divided in our own minds.\r\nWe make laws furiously and laugh at the laws we make. We pretend that\r\nthe little men of politics are great and then privately we indicate our\r\nreal perception of the truth by telling how small they are. Politics is\r\nsuspect and it stamps you as a person of penetration to show that you\r\nare aware what sham and dishonesty there is in them. It is almost as\r\ngood an evidence of a superior mind as to say, \"Of course I don't\r\nbelieve what I read in the newspapers.\" Now satire is enjoyed by\r\nsuperior minds, and it is only with regard to politics that we as a\r\npeople have superior minds, politics not being like business the pursuit\r\nof honest everyday folk.\r\n\r\nJim Reed is then that part of ourselves which tells us that\r\nself-government is a good deal of a sham, in the hands of amusing\r\ncharlatans. We tolerate him in perhaps the only place where we would\r\ntolerate a satirist, in the Senate. And in the Senate they fear him.\r\n\r\nHe was attacking the Four Power Pact. \"People say,\" he declared, \"that\r\nthis ends the Anglo-Japanese alliance. I do not find it in the pact. I\r\ndo not find it nominated in the bond,\" he shouted. And the friends of\r\nthe pact sat silent afraid of Reed's power as a debater, until Senator\r\nLenroot having studied the document several minutes in the cloakroom\r\nread the plain language of the agreement to end the alliance. Reed\r\nalmost \"got away with it\" himself. But this is not leadership. One does\r\nnot follow a satirist. One makes him a privileged character at most.\r\n\r\nReed and Borah are privileged characters each in his own way. The\r\nprivilege of being \"queer\" is as old as the herd itself. The harmless\r\ninsane man was almost sacred in primitive society. The \"fool\" was the\r\nonly man whose disrespect did not amount to _lese majeste_. The wisdom\r\nof the \"fool\" was regarded with a certain awe and admiration. But the\r\ndeath rate among those who sought this franchise must have been high.\r\nIt must be personality which decides who survives and achieves this\r\nlicense and who does not, a nice capacity for adjustment, a rare sense\r\nof what the crowd will endure. Borah and Reed have it, LaFollette has\r\nnot or has not chosen to exercise it.\r\n\r\nGeorge Moore somewhere says that if you can convince a woman that it is\r\nall play, all Pan and nymph, between you and her, you have the perfect\r\nway of a man with a maid, when his aim is something short of matrimony.\r\nBut if you are too serious about it--! LaFollette is perhaps too serious\r\nabout it. If he could have said what he had to say with a laugh and so\r\nas to raise a laugh he might have been privileged like Reed, or, if he\r\nhad to be serious, he should have been serious like Borah, in a detached\r\nand impersonal fashion; then perhaps he might still have been something\r\nless than the public enemy that he is. But LaFollette is serious,\r\nterribly serious, terribly in earnest. He has had convictions, clung to\r\nthem, and probably suffered more for them than any man in Washington.\r\n\r\nThe Wisconsin Senator is one of the least understood men in public life.\r\nIn the Senate he speaks violently, with a harsh voice and an excess of\r\nmanner. He is small and some of this loudness and emphasis is no doubt\r\nthat compensation for lack of stature and presence to which men\r\nunconsciously resort; some of it is an exterior which has been\r\ncultivated to cover up an unusually shy and sensitive heart. The\r\ncharacter in history and fiction which most intrigues him is Hamlet,\r\nthat gentle soul unfit for life. He has spent years studying the shy\r\nDane. He himself is a Hamlet who has taken up arms against a sea of\r\ntroubles. The \"queer\" man who would gain a franchise for his \"queerness\"\r\nmust not be sensitive. The crowd likes better to persecute than to\r\ntolerate.\r\n\r\nThen too LaFollette entered the Senate when minorities were less\r\ntolerable than they are today. He got the stamp of impossible when\r\nRoosevelt led a movement in his direction and he refused to be a part of\r\nit. Thus he became isolated, neither Progressive nor Old Guard. You can\r\nnot safely be too uncompromising, too serious. It makes no difference if\r\nyou were right in rejecting both wings of the party as reactionary which\r\nthey speedily proved to be. It makes no difference if you were right in\r\nopposing the war, and no one is so sure today that LaFollette was wrong\r\nin doing so as men were when it was proposed to expel him from the\r\nSenate. Justification after the fact does no good. It is not your\r\nwrongness that they hate; it's your uncompromising quality, and that\r\nremains more unbreakable than ever.\r\n\r\nAn unusual loyalty explains the unwillingness to compromise. LaFollette\r\nattaches himself deeply. A characteristic act was his leaving the Senate\r\nfor months to nurse a sick son back to health. It sets him apart from\r\nmost men, who do not let sickness in the family interfere with their\r\nbusiness and perform their full duty when they hire a trained nurse.\r\nPeople think of LaFollette, the public man, as an egoist but this\r\nnursing of his son showed the utmost absence of egoism. And so it is\r\nwith all his intimate relations, which are unusually sweet and tender.\r\n\r\nWhatever he is like privately, publicly he is placed, rated, catalogued;\r\nthe general mind is made up. The farm bloc no more turned to him than to\r\nBorah for leadership. He will always remain isolated.\r\n\r\nNow that party discipline has been broken down, what nonconformist\r\nSenators suffer most from is the tyranny of the teapot. Senator Kenyon\r\nreferred to it when he said Newberry on trial for fitness for his seat\r\n\"floated back into the Senate on an ocean of tea.\" An unparliamentary\r\nversion of the same reference to the social influence is: \"The Senate is\r\none long procession of dinners and hootch.\"\r\n\r\nIf you are regular politically you are regular socially. Given the habit\r\nof voting with the crowd, of putting others at ease by a not too great\r\ndisplay of intellect, a good cook, a pre-war cellar, and a not\r\nimpossible wife, and you belong to the Senatorial middle class, the new\r\nrich insurance agents, lawyers, miners, and manufacturers who control\r\nthe fate of the socially ambitious. You may not be invited to the\r\nWadsworths', or may be seldom asked there. But you are accepted by what\r\nMencken might call the wealthy \"booboisie,\" the circle Mr. Harding\r\nfrequented before he was advanced to the White House.\r\n\r\nIf you don't you are of the Senatorial proletariat. You are invited out\r\nseldom or not at all. You have to organize a little set of\r\nintellectuals, not found in the Senate, for your wife's tea parties.\r\n\r\nSenator Kenyon was a moderate nonconformist. Intellectually he was\r\nhonest, but not strong, so that an outsider might have thought that his\r\nhonesty and independence would be overlooked. But he was never accepted\r\nby the \"booboisie.\" He was virtually cold shouldered out of the Senate,\r\nfor it was with immense relief that he escaped from teapot ostracism to\r\nthe securer social area of the Federal bench.\r\n\r\nI repeat a bit of gossip about the Iowa Senator without vouching for it.\r\nWhen he was retiring, it is said, a reporter asked, \"What can be done\r\nwith the Senate?\" \"Nothing,\" replied the Iowan, \"The only thing to do is\r\nto destroy it.\" If he said this he really flattered the \"booboisie.\"\r\nDestruction is reserved for wicked things like Sodom and Gomorrah. But\r\nthe Senate is not wicked. It is good, honest in the sense of not\r\nstealing, well-meaning, timid, petty, tea-drinking, human, commonplace.\r\nYou can't destroy it unless you have something to put in its place, and\r\nthere is nothing. Much better turn it over to the blocs and see what\r\nthey will do with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nA PEAK OF REALITY THRUSTS UP ON THE LEVEL PLAIN OF SHAMS\r\n\r\n\r\nAs well fear blocs and minorities as fear the centrifugal force on the\r\nground that it is seeking to pull us off the face of the earth.\r\nMinorities are the centrifugal force of politics. They maintain the\r\nbalance of forces which makes political existence possible. Without them\r\nthe State would become unbearable; it would destroy us or we should be\r\ncompelled to destroy it.\r\n\r\nWe have just passed through a period, the war, in which minorities were\r\nsuppressed, in which the general will brooked no resistance, in which\r\nthe bodies of men between certain ages and the minds of men and women of\r\nall ages were brought into compulsory service of the State. The mental\r\ndraft dodger went to jail just as much as the physical draft dodger.\r\n\r\nA Chief of an Industrial Workers of the World Longshoremans' Union was\r\nsentenced for twenty years because he was an I. W. W., although under\r\nhis direction his organization handled efficiently all the munitions of\r\nwar shipped from Philadelphia. He \"obstructed the war\" by his thoughts\r\nas an I. W. W., even though his actions as a citizen contributed to\r\nsuccess in the war.\r\n\r\nOne may tolerate during a national emergency the oppression that results\r\nfrom the crushing of minorities, but in time of peace it is only in the\r\nbalance of political forces that political existence may go on.\r\n\r\nAll freedom is the work of minorities and so is all change. Respect for\r\nopinion is dearly bought by them. Majority views were all once minority\r\nviews. Some political theorists even go so far as to say that all\r\ngovernments, no matter what apparent precautions are taken to represent\r\nmajorities, are really conducted by minorities. Without the effective\r\nresistance of minorities the general will may become tyrannous or\r\nwithout the stimulus they afford it may become inert.\r\n\r\nThe blocs and minorities that are appearing in American public life are\r\naccomplishing a measure of decentralization. The highly centralized\r\ngovernment which we recently built up is itself passing into the control\r\nof the various economic subdivisions of society. In them rather than in\r\nit is coming to be final authority.\r\n\r\nTake freight rates for an illustration. Originally they were localized,\r\nin the unrestricted control of the railroad managers. Then they were\r\nslightly centralized in the partial control of state and partial\r\ncontrol of national authorities. Then control was wholly centralized in\r\nthe Inter-State Commerce Commission at Washington, the States being\r\ndenied effective authority even over rates within their own borders.\r\n\r\nThere you have bureaucracy at its worst, authority in the hands of an\r\nappointive commission, thousands of miles, in many cases, from the place\r\nwhere it was applied, and a public feeling its impotence, which is the\r\nnegation of self-government.\r\n\r\nThen comes the first step in decentralization. No locality, no State was\r\nbig enough to reach out and get back the authority over its own railroad\r\nservice that it once had. But the organized farmers of the whole country\r\nwere able to take into their hands the power over the railroads as it\r\naffected them. Nominally the Inter-State Commerce Commission still makes\r\nrates. Practically the farmers, having the balance of power in the House\r\nand Senate, say what rates they want on agricultural products and get\r\nthem. That is decentralization.\r\n\r\nThe division into States which the jealous colonists preserved in\r\nforming the Union has largely lost its significance. Men divide now\r\naccording to their interests, not according to boundaries that may be\r\nlearned in the school geographies. As the States weakened many of their\r\npowers gradually tended to be centralized in the national government. As\r\nthe newer economic subdivisions of society become organized and\r\nself-assertive some of the power thus centralized in Washington\r\ndevolves upon them, not legally or formally, but actually and in\r\npractice. They constitute minorities too large to be denied.\r\n\r\nIt is only through decentralization that popular institutions can be\r\nkept alive, only through it that government remains near enough to the\r\npeople to hold their interest and only through it that freedom from an\r\noppressive State is preserved.\r\n\r\nWhy should minorities be regarded with such aversion? Why should\r\nPresident Harding declaim against them so persistently? Our Federal\r\nConstitution is written full of safeguards for minorities. The reservoir\r\nof power is in the minorities, the States, the local subdivisions which\r\nfeared the loss of their identity and independence through the central\r\ngovernment they were creating.\r\n\r\nOnly powers expressly yielded by the local units may be assumed by the\r\nRepublic. The States were the minorities; they felt when they joined the\r\nUnion that their rights as minorities had to be jealously guarded, in\r\norder that they might have the realities of self-government.\r\n\r\nYou have in the rule that the small State must have as many Senators as\r\nthe large State a sharp assertion of the right of geographical\r\nminorities. If the larger States had not accepted this principle the\r\nsmaller States would never have joined the Union.\r\n\r\nGradually these geographical minorities lost their importance in the\r\npublic consciousness. Our people had come and kept coming to this\r\ncountry from the ends of the earth. Arriving here they continued to be\r\nnomads, sweeping over the West in search of new pasture lands or more\r\nfertile soil, moving from the farm to the city and thrusting their roots\r\nin nowhere. No difference of language or customs set up arbitrary\r\nfrontiers.\r\n\r\nMoreover we were the first people to settle a land where modern methods\r\nof locomotion destroyed the use and wont of limited localities. Instead\r\nof being citizens of New York united with the citizens of New Jersey,\r\nConnecticut, and the rest of them for the common defense, as our\r\nforefathers imagined, we became citizens of the United States, which was\r\ndivided into New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and the rest for\r\npurposes of policing, road-making, and other functions that could be\r\nbetter managed at home than from Washington.\r\n\r\nA State began to assume about the same place in the Union that a county\r\ndoes in a State.\r\n\r\nThe basic reality for our forefathers was the State, the Union existing\r\nfor the convenience of the States. The basic reality for us is the\r\nUnion, the States existing for the convenience of the Union, which is\r\ntoo vast to administer everything from a central point.\r\n\r\nAs the geographical subdivisions lost their significance economic\r\nsubdivisions rose to take their place. The farmer of Kansas began to\r\nhave more in common with the farmer of Iowa than he had with the coal\r\nminer of his own State. The nationwide organization of farmers resulted,\r\nand it is a more real unit in the political consciousness than is that\r\nunit on which the Fathers laid such stress, the State. It is a minority\r\nthat has no reserve rights under the Constitution but which achieves its\r\nrights by force of numbers and organization.\r\n\r\nThese economic subdivisions are the reality today. The United States is\r\na union of the State of Agriculture, the State of Labor, the State of\r\nManufacturing, and a dozen other occupational States of greater or less\r\nimportance. And after all why should not Agriculture, Manufacturing,\r\nLabor, Foreign, and Domestic Commerce form a union for the national\r\ndefense, carefully reserving essential powers to themselves as States,\r\njust as the thirteen original colonies did? Why should we let this new\r\npolitical organism keep us awake nights?\r\n\r\nNationally we have a complex on the subject of disunion. Fortunate\r\nperhaps is the country which is subject to the pressure of a foreign\r\nenemy on its border, as France is, for example, to that of Germany. If\r\nyou have a convenient foe to be afraid of you do not have to be afraid\r\nof yourselves. It seems to be the rule that nations like individuals\r\nmust have fears and the American phobia is that this country will\r\nproceed amoeba-wise by scission, into several countries. When we feel\r\na weakening at the center we feel a horror in the peripheries.\r\n\r\nWe fought one great war to prevent a breaking up of the Union and\r\nwhenever we hear the word \"section,\" we become apprehensive. And just as\r\n\"section\" fills our minds with fear of cleavage upon geographical lines,\r\nso \"class\" arouses anxiety over cleavage upon social lines. \"Class\"\r\ncalls up the spectre of socialism. \"Bloc\" moreover is a word of unhappy\r\nassociations. It brings into the imagination Europe with all its turmoil\r\nand its final catastrophe.\r\n\r\nThe Civil War left us with one complex. The European War left us with\r\nanother. The agricultural bloc touches both, suggesting division and\r\nupon European lines. Being agricultural it is vaguely sectional; being\r\nthe projection of a single interest into national politics so as to cut\r\nacross parties, it follows European precedents. It moreover derives its\r\nname from abroad.\r\n\r\nCall it log-rolling by the farmers, however, and it relates to the\r\nhabitual method of American legislation. It conforms to our best\r\ntraditions. We never spoke of the groups which filled pork barrels of\r\nthe past as blocs, but every river and harbor bill was the work of\r\nminorities uniting to raid the treasury. The two recent amendments to\r\nthe Constitution, granting the suffrage to women and prohibiting the\r\nmanufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages, were also achieved\r\nminorities.\r\n\r\nThe organized minorities of the past dissolved when their end was\r\nobtained. They had a specific rather than a general purpose. Usually it\r\nwas a moral purpose, the prohibition of alcoholic drinks, or political\r\njustice for woman. Never until recently did a minority raise the\r\neconomic interests of one section of society against those of the rest\r\nof society and promise to keep on raising them. The farm bloc is the\r\nfirst permanent economic minority to organize itself effectively for\r\npolitical action.\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon is not that the bloc impairs our political system; it\r\ndoes not; majority rule is always tempered by minority rule or it\r\nbecomes either a tyranny or a dead thing. It is that it threatens our\r\npocketbooks. It obtains low railroad rates on farm products. It shifts\r\ntaxes from farmers to the rest of us. It secures for farmers special aid\r\nin the form of government credits.\r\n\r\nNevertheless its appearance is the most hopeful sign in Washington that\r\nwe may emerge from the governmental bog into which we have sunk. We had\r\ncentralized to the point of creating an immense and dull bureaucracy\r\nheaded by a weak Executive and equally weak Congress. Interest in\r\nself-government was being destroyed by the mere remoteness and\r\nirresponsiveness of the mechanism. \"The parties are exactly alike. What\r\ndifference does it make which is in power?\"\r\n\r\nWe had created an organization too vast for any one to take it in hand.\r\nAnd the only remedy in that case is to break the organization down.\r\nDecentralization into States was impossible, for men never go back to\r\noutworn forms, and State boundaries had ceased to be the real lines of\r\ndivision in American society. A way out of this difficulty has been\r\nfound through the seizing of power by occupational organizations, of\r\nwhich the farm bloc is the most famous and most successful.\r\n\r\nWe could not go on as we are, with an enfeebled Executive and an\r\nenfeebled Congress. And, if I have analyzed the situation correctly, we\r\nshall have no more strong Executives, until some national emergency\r\nunites the people temporarily for the accomplishment of some single\r\npurpose. The Executive is the greatest common divisor of a diverse\r\nsociety. Congress, equally, is weak so long as it remains a Congress\r\nbased upon the present theory of party government, for the party has to\r\nbe stretched out too thin, has to represent too many different views to\r\nhave character and purpose. Steadily parties are being driven more and\r\nmore to pure negation. Wilson was elected the first time on the negative\r\nissue, \"No more Roosevelt and his radicalism,\" and the second time on\r\nthe negative issue, \"He kept us out of war,\" and Harding upon the\r\nnegative issue, \"No more Wilson.\"\r\n\r\nIf the two existing parties cannot be positive and constructive, \"Why\r\nnot scrap them both?\" asks Mr. Samuel G. Blythe. Why not, indeed?\r\nexcept for the fact that you can find no principle upon which to found a\r\nthird party. If there were a positive principle upon which a majority of\r\nthe voters would agree the existing parties would grab for it. They are\r\ncolorless and negative not by choice but by necessity.\r\n\r\nLet us look at the situation. The public is disgusted with the existing\r\nparties and becoming indifferent to the possibilities of the suffrage\r\nand of popular government, an unhealthy sign. A new party is out of the\r\nquestion, for to succeed any new party must be broad enough to cover all\r\nsorts and conditions of men, divergent groups and interests. It must at\r\nonce have the defects of the old parties.\r\n\r\nSo long as parties \"must be careful,\" to quote Mr. Harding, executives\r\nmust \"be careful\" and Congress organized on the party basis \"must be\r\ncareful.\" We gravitate toward negation.\r\n\r\nWe face in government perhaps what it is said we face in industry and in\r\nwar, organization on such a scale that men are no longer masters of it.\r\nUnder such circumstances there is nothing to do but to break it up into\r\nits component parts. That is what the group or bloc system is, a\r\nresolution into component parts.\r\n\r\nIt is precisely what will happen in the industrial field if the great\r\ncombinations of twenty years ago prove too unwieldy. The vertical trust,\r\nthe single industry, organized like the Stinnes group or like the Henry\r\nFord industry from the raw material to the finished product but seeking\r\nno monopoly, promises to take the place of the horizontal trust of\r\nmonopolistic tendency. The bloc is a vertical organization appearing in\r\nthe field of politics, which hitherto has been dominated by the\r\nhorizontal organization of the parties.\r\n\r\nA vertical organization, like everything vertical in this world, tends\r\nto rest upon the solid earth. It has its base in reality. The bloc\r\nintroduces reality into public life. It will be represented by men who\r\nare not ashamed to stand frankly for the selfish interests of their\r\ngroup.\r\n\r\nWhen we banished selfish interests from the government a few years ago\r\nwe banished all interests--and even all interest, too--leaving very\r\nlittle but hypocrisy and timidity. The representatives of a group will\r\nnot have to be all things to all men as our party men are, but only one\r\nthing to one kind of men.\r\n\r\nIf we cannot get our present parties to stand for anything, if for the\r\nsame reason we cannot form a new party to stand for anything, we can at\r\nleast introduce principles into politics through the force of group\r\nsupport. Blocs will be positive, not merely negative as the parties have\r\nbecome. They do not have to please everybody. They can and must be\r\nconstructive.\r\n\r\nThe clash of ideas which we miss between parties may take place between\r\nblocs. I am assuming, as everyone in Washington does, that the farm\r\nbloc is only a forerunner of other similar political efforts, for every\r\neconomic interest which is organized among the voters may extend itself\r\nvertically into Congress.\r\n\r\nThere will be a gain in decentralization, there will be a gain in\r\nhonesty, there will be a gain in constructive political effort through\r\nthe direct representation of the real interests of society in Congress.\r\n\r\nNor does there appear any danger of the break up into utterly unrelated\r\nminorities such as has taken place, let us say, in France and Germany.\r\nWe have what most European countries has not, an elected Executive who\r\nplays an important part in legislation, the President with his veto\r\npower. So long as the presidential office retains this function, and it\r\nis always likely to retain it, there must be national parties within\r\nwhich the minorities, interests, or occupational groups, must cooperate.\r\n\r\nGroups will not be able in this country as in Europe to elect members of\r\nthe national legislature independently, then form a combination and pick\r\ntheir own Executive. They are under compulsion to elect the Executive at\r\nlarge by the votes of the whole people; they must hold together enough\r\nfor that purpose.\r\n\r\nThe centrifugal tendency of minorities in the American system is thus\r\neffectively restrained. Groups must work within the parties, as the\r\nagricultural bloc has done and as the proposed liberal workers bloc\r\npromises to do. A handful of seats in Congress alone is not worth\r\nfighting for: that is why all third party movements have failed. A\r\nhandful of seats in a European parliament is worth having; it may\r\ndictate the choice of the Executive; that is why parties are numerous\r\nabroad. In other words \"bloc\" is a useful name as indicating a radical\r\ndeparture in our political system but it contains no threat for this\r\ncountry of the political disintegration prevailing in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe names Republican and Democrat are likely to last as convenient\r\ndesignations of the accord reached for national purposes between the\r\nvertical organizations which represent economic or other group interests\r\nof the people. Unity is thus preserved as well as diversity, which is\r\nwhat upon geographical lines, the Father of the Constitution sought.\r\n\r\nYou have only to regard the agricultural bloc to perceive the truth of\r\nthis analysis. Primarily its members are Republicans or Democrats and\r\nonly secondarily representatives of agriculture. They have rejected\r\nleadership of a separatist tendency, choosing the moderate guidance of\r\nMr. Kenyon and Mr. Capper rather than the more individualistic\r\ngeneralship of Mr. Borah or Mr. La Follette. Some day their successors\r\nmay be primarily representatives of agriculture and only secondarily\r\nRepublicans or Democrats, but in one of the two big parties they must\r\nretain their standing, or share the fate of third parties, a fate\r\nmade inevitable by the necessity electing of a chief executive at\r\nlarge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SENATOR ARTHUR I CAPPER OF KANSAS]\r\n\r\nWhen the farmer votes for legislators who will represent primarily the\r\nfarm interest, and the laborer for legislators who will represent\r\nprimarily the labor interest and the business man for legislators who\r\nwill represent the business interests self-government will assume a new\r\nimportance, even though all of these interests will have to be\r\nsubordinated to the general interest for the sake of cooperation with a\r\nparty in the choice of an Executive.\r\n\r\nI have compared the group organization to the vertical trust of the\r\nindustrial world. The resemblance is striking. Take the instance of Herr\r\nStinness, the most interesting figure in manufacturing today. Originally\r\nhe was a coal mine owner. Instead of spreading laterally to monopolize\r\ncoal he builds upward from his raw material to finished products. He\r\nadds iron to his holdings and manufactures electrical supplies and\r\nelectricity. He owns his own ships for the carrying of his products. He\r\nwould buy railroads from the German government for the transporting of\r\nthem. He owns newspapers for political action. And the whole\r\norganization culminates with himself in the Reichstag, and in\r\ninternational relations where he is almost as significant a figure as\r\nthe German government itself.\r\n\r\nMr. Henry Ford, a lesser person, started at the other end and organized\r\ndownward to the raw material. He now owns his own mines, his railroads\r\nfor shipping, his raw material and products, his steel foundries, the\r\nfactories which turn out his finished products, his weekly newspaper,\r\nand he is himself a political figure of no one yet knows how much\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nThe farmers are organized for social purposes, for the distribution of\r\ninformation among themselves, for cooperation in buying and selling, for\r\nmaintaining a lobby at Washington and finally for political action.\r\nPolitical action crowns an organization which serves all the purposes\r\nfor which union is required.\r\n\r\nPractically every other interest is organized to the point of\r\nmaintaining a lobby at Washington. Only the farmers have developed\r\norganization in Congress. Only they have adapted their organization to\r\nall their needs, social and political. Only they have the perfect\r\nvertical trust running straight up from the weekly entertainment in the\r\nunion or bureau to the Senate in Washington, where their Senators do the\r\nbidding of their agent, Mr. Gray Silver.\r\n\r\nIndispensable to effective special interest representation seems to be\r\nan organization for other than political purposes which brings the\r\nvoters of a class or occupation together. Labor has such an organization\r\nin its unions. Business has it perhaps in its Chambers of Commerce and\r\nBoards of Trade. Either of them has the means at its disposal for\r\nimitating the farmers and developing a bloc in the national legislature.\r\n\r\nIt is natural that the farm interest should be the first to push its way\r\nbeyond the lobby or propaganda stage at Washington to that of organized\r\nrepresentation on the floor of Congress. Agriculture is the single\r\ninterest or the immensely predominating interest in many States. A\r\nSenator or Representative from such a state may safely consider himself\r\na representative of agriculture. But in a more fully developed community\r\nthere is a diversity of interests. Where there is capital there is also\r\nlabor. Moreover most of the industrial States have also their\r\nagricultural interest. It is not safe for an Eastern Senator or\r\nRepresentative, as the situation now stands, to identify himself with\r\nany minority. He must at least pretend to \"represent the whole people.\"\r\n\r\nIf the vertical movement in politics proceeds, as it almost inevitably\r\nmust, it will manifest itself effectively first in the lower house.\r\nCongress districts are small units. In an industrial State one district\r\nmay be prevailingly agricultural, another prevailingly labor, another\r\nprevailingly commercial. Groups operating within a party will tend to\r\nparcel out the districts among themselves holding their support of each\r\nother's candidates, as the Liberal and Labor parties have often done in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nThe Senate will be less responsive. States are large units and, except\r\nin farming regions, are not prevailingly of one interest. But a division\r\nmay be effected like that which now gives one Senator to the eastern and\r\nanother to the western, or one to the urban and another to the rural\r\npart of the State. One Senator may go to business and another to\r\nagriculture or to labor as the case may be.\r\n\r\nWhat I have just written is by way of illustration. I have spoken of\r\nagricultural, labor and business blocs not because these are the only\r\ndivisions of society that may be organized for political purpose but\r\nbecause they already have the basic machinery and seem certain to thrust\r\nupwards till they are prominently represented in Congress. Other\r\nminority interests are already showing themselves, as for example the\r\nsoldiers of the late war and the inland waterways group. These and\r\nothers like them, some permanent and some temporary, will cut across the\r\nmain subdivisions, so that men who are divided on one interest will be\r\nunited on another and thus furnish a further cement in the body politic\r\nin addition to the necessity of joint action upon the presidency.\r\n\r\nThus there is less danger of our being ruled by minorities than there is\r\nof minorities having to surrender too much of their purposes for the\r\nsake of unity among themselves and of our thus being in spite of their\r\norganization little better off than we are now, reduced by the sheer\r\nmass that has to be moved to a policy of inaction and negation.\r\n\r\nIn an earlier chapter I analyzed the Senate to show how weak and\r\nwill-less it is and how inferior is its personnel, how prostrate it lies\r\nbefore any powerful minority which has a purpose and the will to carry\r\nit out. I used the Senate as typical of Congress; a desire to save space\r\nand to avoid repetitions kept me from a similar study of the House. In\r\nthe same way the parties lie ready for the uses of minorities. They are\r\nwill-less. They have no aim and express no unity because when the old\r\npioneer will to exploit as quickly as possible the national resources\r\nwithout regard to waste, physical or social, ceased to operate, there\r\nwas no unity, except, as I have explained, for temporary purposes, for\r\nsocial defense under Roosevelt and for national defense under Wilson,\r\ntwo essentially negative ends.\r\n\r\nMr. Will H. Hays trying to tell the Republican senate how to vote on the\r\nLeague covenant, was a less powerful figure than was Mr. Wayne B.\r\nWheeler ordering it to vote that more than one half of one per cent of\r\nalcohol in a beverage was intoxicating, or Mr. Gray Silver forcing it to\r\nextend credits to farmers, or Colonel Taylor frightening it into voting\r\nfor a soldiers' bonus.\r\n\r\nThe old party bosses are dead. No machine leader will control as many\r\ndelegates in the next national convention as will Mr. Gray Silver. So\r\nfar as delegates are now led they are led by Senators and\r\nRepresentatives. A Senate group chose Mr. Harding at Chicago. And\r\nSenators and Representatives lie at the mercy of organized minorities.\r\n\r\nThe Republican party in 1920 was an agglomeration of minorities, held\r\ntogether by no better binder than the negation of Wilsonism. There were\r\nthe German vote, the Irish vote and the other foreign votes; the farmer\r\nvote, the business vote, the old American vote, the frightened vote, the\r\nherd vote and every conceivable kind of vote. It was in effect a bloc,\r\nin the European sense of that word, a combination of small parties.\r\nThese minorities were mostly unorganized in 1920 or imperfectly\r\norganized; their development vertically is now going on. Some of them\r\nwill appear as definitely upon the floor of the 1924 convention as the\r\nagricultural group has upon the floor of Congress.\r\n\r\nWith the organization of minorities Congress becomes important, for it\r\nis in Congress that the Fathers in their wisdom provided for the\r\nexpression of minorities. The Presidency, according to the argument used\r\nbefore in this book, dwindles to a charming embodiment of that great\r\nAmerican negative--nationwide public opinion. The only ordinarily\r\navailable positive--group opinion--finds its play in the Legislature.\r\nThere will be determined upon whose shoulders the taxes will be shifted,\r\nwho shall have effective rebates in freight rates, and more important\r\nstill, who shall use for his group interests the government control of\r\ncredit. Where these questions are being decided there public\r\nattention will concentrate. There will be the stress upon government.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GREY SILVER, THE MAN BEHIND THE FARM BLOC]\r\n\r\nAs Congress becomes more important better men will be drawn into it.\r\nThere will be a gain to public life in this country from emphasis upon\r\nthe parliamentary side of government. As it is now only one prize in\r\nAmerican politics is worth while and that is the Presidency. And there\r\nis no known rule by which men may attain to it. Candidates for it are\r\nchosen at random, from governing a State, from an obscure position in\r\nthe Senate, from the army, it may be; in no case does it come as the\r\ncertain reward of national service.\r\n\r\nAnd if, as happened when Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. Wilson were made\r\nPresident, really able men attain the office, they may serve their\r\ncountry only four years, or eight years at most, and then must retire\r\nfrom view. In England, for example, similar men are at the head of the\r\ngovernment or leading the opposition for the greater part of a lifetime.\r\nEnglish public life would inevitably look richer than ours even were it\r\nnot richer, for when they breed a statesman in England they use him for\r\nyears. We discard him after four or eight years. We have not the system\r\nfor developing statesmen and when by chance we find one we waste him.\r\n\r\nWe put our faith in the jack-of-all-trades and the amateur. We have the\r\ncheerful notion that the \"crisis produces the man.\" This is nothing\r\nmore than the justice illusion which is lodged in the minds of men, an\r\nidea, religious in its origin, that no time of trial would arrive unless\r\nthe man to meet it were benignantly sent along with it, a denial of\r\nhuman responsibility, an encouragement to the happy-go-lucky notion that\r\neverything always comes out right in the end.\r\n\r\nThe world, in going through the greatest crisis in history has\r\ncontroverted this cheerful belief, for it has not produced \"the man\"\r\neither here or elsewhere. No one appeared big enough to prevent the war.\r\nNo one appeared big enough to shorten the war. No one appeared big\r\nenough to effect a real peace. And no one appeared big enough to guide\r\nthis country wisely either in the war or in the making of peace, which\r\nis still going on.\r\n\r\nOnly in parliamentary life is there enough permanency and enough\r\nopportunity for the breeding of statesmen. We shall never have them\r\nwhile the Presidency with its hazards and its wastes is stressed as it\r\nhas been in recent years.\r\n\r\nAnd Congress itself must be reformed before it will encourage and\r\ndevelop ability. The seniority rule, to which reference has been made\r\nbefore, must be abolished before talent will have its opportunity in the\r\nlegislative branch.\r\n\r\nOne of the first things that aggressive minorities would be likely to do\r\nis to reach out for the important committee chairmanships. Already the\r\nseniority rule has been broken in the House, when Martin Madden was\r\nmade Chairman of the Appropriations Committee instead of the senior\r\nRepublican, an inadequate person from Minnesota.\r\n\r\nAnd in any case the seniority rule will be severely tested in the\r\nSenate. If Senator McCumber is defeated in North Dakota and Senator\r\nLodge is defeated or dies, Senator Borah will be in line to be chairman\r\nof the important Foreign Relations Committee. When Senator Cummins, who\r\nis sick, dies or retires and Senator Townsend is defeated, which now\r\nseems likely, Senator LaFollette will be in line to be chairman of the\r\nSenate Committee on Interstate Commerce. Both irregulars will then\r\nattain places of vast power unless the seniority rule is abrogated.\r\n\r\nThus even the machine in the Senate will soon be under pressure to do\r\naway with the absurd method of awarding mere length of service with\r\npower and place.\r\n\r\nMinorities when they determine to take the Senate and the House out of\r\nthe enfeebled grasp of incompetent regularity will inevitably find\r\nprecedents already established for them.\r\n\r\nA richer public life will come from the breakdown of the safeguards of\r\nmediocrity and from the stressing of the legislative at the expense of\r\nthe executive branch of the government. Both these results are likely to\r\nfollow from the effective appearance of minority interests in Congress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE HAPPY ENDING\r\n\r\n\r\nI have hesitated a long time over writing this last chapter, because of\r\nthe natural desire to give to my book a happy ending.\r\n\r\nOne may write critically of America and things American, but only if one\r\nends in a mood of hopeful confidence. There is so much youth, so much\r\nlatent power here, that one cannot fail to have faith that the spirit of\r\nman will gain some enlargement from the experiment in living which we\r\nare carrying on in this country.\r\n\r\nAnd even if that were not true, egotism requires us to believe that we\r\nare ever going forward to better things; for how should \"the forces\"\r\nhave the effrontery to establish so splendid a people as ourselves upon\r\nso rich a continent, while reserving for us nothing but a commonplace\r\ncareer, that of one of the many peoples who have from time to time\r\noccupied the fairer regions of the earth?\r\n\r\nAt least we shall fill a place in history alongside Greece and Rome; we\r\nfeel it as the imaginative young man feels in himself the stirrings of\r\na future Shakespeare, Napoleon, or Lincoln.\r\n\r\nThe human mind refuses to conceive of so much power coming to ordinary\r\nends. The justice illusion which men have found so indispensable a\r\ncompanion on their way through time requires the happy ending. As it is\r\nonly right and fair that when the forces send us a crisis they should\r\nsend us a man equal to it, so it is only right and fair that when they\r\nput so great a people as ourselves in the world they should prepare for\r\nit a splendid destiny.\r\n\r\nI subscribe heartily to this doctrine. It is as convincing as any I have\r\never seen based on the theory which we all cheerfully accept, that man\r\nis not master of his own fate, that he does not need to be, that he had\r\nbetter not be, that he reaps where he does not sow, reaps, indeed,\r\nabundant crops.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chapter, working toward the happy ending, I have\r\nbrought my characters to the verge of felicity: the perfect union\r\nbetween minorities and majorities, which is the aim of all social order,\r\nis in sight.\r\n\r\nI have based my minorities upon self-interest, thus introducing into our\r\ngovernment the selfish interests banished therefrom twenty years ago.\r\nTheir banishment was an achievement of virtue. Their reintroduction is\r\nthe accomplishment of good sense. They are the great reality while the\r\nworld thinks as it does.\r\n\r\nSince someone somewhere, in a treatise on economics probably, penned\r\nthe phrase \"enlightened self-interest,\" we have all more or less become\r\nenamored of the idea that wisdom--enlightenment--reposes in the bosom of\r\nselfishness. Justice requires that wisdom should be somewhere. The\r\nreasoning runs like this. The world cannot get on without wisdom.\r\nJustice demands that the world should get on. Therefore there is wisdom\r\nin the world. We know it is not in ourselves or in our neighbors. We\r\nfeel, therefore, that it must be in the bosom of perfect selfishness.\r\nAnd as we cast our eyes about us we think we know where the bosom of\r\nperfect selfishness is, and we feel assured.\r\n\r\nSometimes, of course, we place it in the heads of all mankind, it being\r\na thing that no one man has and no few men have, but which is one of\r\nthose mysterious properties of the aggregate which does not inhere in\r\nthe individuals composing the aggregate; a sort of colloidal element\r\nthat comes from shaking men up together, though all are without it\r\nbefore the mixing and shaking.\r\n\r\nSome would place it, as Mr. Wilson seems to in a famous passage on\r\nminorities, in the breasts of the enlightened few. When the few\r\ndisagreed with him, he threw them and their wisdom in jail.\r\n\r\nBut wherever it is, it is sure to be found in a system which preserved\r\nthe old parties representing the general mind of the country along with\r\nthe new vertical political organizations, representing the minorities,\r\nthrusting up like volcanoes upon the placid plane of politics that Mr.\r\nHarding once delighted to survey.\r\n\r\nYou have in this combination the spontaneous wisdom of the masses, if\r\nthat is where wisdom generates. You have the wisdom of the few, if you\r\nbelieve in impregnation from above, and you have the wisdom of\r\nselfishness, if you believe as most of us do in the enlightenment of\r\nself-interest. And no one ever located wisdom anywhere else than in\r\nthese three places, for the first, as I might easily demonstrate, is the\r\nmodern democratic name for the wisdom of God; the second is the wisdom\r\nof men; and the third is the wisdom of the serpent; beside which there\r\nare no other wisdoms.\r\n\r\nThis you will admit is moving rapidly and without reserve toward the\r\nhappy ending. But I think every writer of a novel has stuck his tongue\r\nin his cheek as he wrote those benedictory words, \"And they lived happy\r\never after.\" And I stick my tongue in my cheek as I think of Mr. Gray\r\nSilver, the effective director of the farmers' vertical political trust\r\nsitting in the Senate, leading it perhaps in place of Senator Lodge of\r\nMassachusetts.\r\n\r\nTo Mr. Lodge's petulant, imperious gesture--the sharp handclap for the\r\npages--would succeed Mr. Silver's fixing gesture, that of a country\r\nmerchant smoothing out a piece of silk before a customer at a counter.\r\nMr. Silver as he talks performs one constant motion, a gentle slow\r\nmoving of both hands horizontally, palms down.\r\n\r\nMr. Silver is a lobbyist with the powers of a dictator, or a dictator\r\nwith the habits of a lobbyist, whichever way you wish to look at it. A\r\nformer farmer, member of the West Virginia legislature, representative\r\nof farm organizations at Washington, he rules the Senate with more power\r\nthan Mr. Lodge has or Mr. Harding has, but always with the gentle touch\r\nof a general-storekeeper, spreading the wrinkles out of a yard of satin.\r\n\r\nBut even this little lobbyist has a certain definiteness which public\r\nmen generally lack. His feet are firmly placed upon reality. He speaks\r\nfor a solid body of opinion. He is a positive rather than a negative\r\nforce. He represents a fairly united minority which knows what it wants,\r\nand men are strong or weak according as they are or are not spokesmen of\r\na cause; and the selfish interest of a group easily takes on the pious\r\naspect of a cause.\r\n\r\nIt is always better to deal with principals than with agents. Gray\r\nSilver, Colonel John H. Taylor, the Apollo of the soldiers' bonus lobby,\r\nperfect ladies' man in appearance, who is full of zeal also for a cause,\r\nthat of those who did not make money out of the war and who should in\r\ncommon justice make it all the rest of their lives out of the peace, and\r\nWayne B. Wheeler, the fanatic leader of the drys, are all more real men\r\nthan those who do their bidding in the Senate and the House.\r\n\r\nNo, if I put my tongue in my cheek as I write the words \"lived happy\r\never after,\" it is because I see only a measure of improvement in the\r\nfreeing of men from existing political conventions which will come from\r\nthe effective emergence of minorities. A richer public life will result\r\nfrom increased vitality of the legislative branch. But a rich public\r\nlife, no; for that requires men. You cannot fashion it out of Lodges,\r\nWatsons, Curtises, Gillettes, Mondells, Hardings, Hugheses, and Hoovers,\r\nor even Gray Silvers, Taylors, or Wheelers.\r\n\r\nAnd we do not breed men in this country. If the test of a civilization\r\nis an unusually high average of national comfort, achieved in a land of\r\nunparalleled resources, whose exploitation was cut off from interruption\r\nby foreign enemies, then this experiment in living which we have been\r\nconducting in America has been a great success; if it is a further\r\nfreeing of the human spirit, such as finds its expression in the rare\r\nindividuals who make up the bright spots in all past human history, then\r\nits success is still to be achieved.\r\n\r\nMany blame the dullness and general averageness which afflicts us upon\r\ndemocracy. There is democracy and there is timidity and stupidity; there\r\nis the appeal to low intelligence; the compulsion to be a best seller\r\nrests upon us all. _Post hoc propter hoc._\r\n\r\nI am going to blame it upon the mistake Euclid made in his theorem about\r\ntwo parallel lines. This was an error of Euclid's, modern mathematics\r\nproves, unless you assume space to be infinite. Having committed\r\nourselves to Euclid, we committed ourselves to a space that was\r\ninfinite. Space being regarded as infinite, man was little, relatively.\r\n\r\nEuclid having made his mistake about the parallels, it followed\r\ninevitably that Mr. Harding should be little.\r\n\r\nI use Mr. Harding only by way of illustration. You may fill any other\r\nname you like of the Washington gallery into that statement of\r\ninevitability and do it no violence. And this very interchangeability of\r\nnames suggests that you must go further back than democracy to find the\r\ncause of today's sterility.\r\n\r\nBesides, we have had infinite space, in our minds; but have we ever had\r\ndemocracy there? De Gourmont writes that no religion ever dies, but it\r\nrather lives on in its successor. Similarly, no form of government ever\r\ndies; it survives in its successor. A nation does not become a democracy\r\nby writing on a bit of paper, \"resolved that we are a democracy, with a\r\ngovernment consisting of executive, legislative, and judicial branches\r\nchosen by majority vote.\"\r\n\r\nGovernment, however organized, is what exists in the minds of the\r\npeople, and in that mind is stored up a dozen superstitions, handed down\r\nfrom primitive days, gathering force from time to time as new names are\r\ngiven to them and new \"scientific\" bases are found for them.\r\n\r\nWe laugh at the divine right of kings, but we could not accept\r\nself-government without bestowing on it an element of divinity. We have\r\nthe divine right of Public Opinion. We can hardly print these words\r\nwithout the reverence of capital letters. The founders of modern\r\ndemocracy knew there could be no government without a miraculous\r\nquality. Formerly one mere man by virtue of ruling became something\r\ndivine. The miracle grew difficult to swallow. You could regard this one\r\nman and see that he was a fool and had too many mistresses. He was the\r\nleast divine-looking thing that could be imagined. Very well then, put\r\nthe divine quality into something remote. All men by virtue of ruling\r\nthemselves became divine.\r\n\r\nAn immense inertia develops between theoretical self-government and the\r\npractical reluctance of humanity to be governed by anything short of the\r\nheavenly hosts. I don't know whether this reluctance springs from racial\r\nmodesty, the feeling that man is not good enough to govern himself, or\r\nfrom racial egotism, the belief that nothing is too good to govern him;\r\nbut it is a great reality. The little men at Washington are will-less in\r\nthe conflict.\r\n\r\nTo overcome this inertia, minorities whose interests cannot wait upon\r\nthe slow benevolent processes of determinism or upon the divine\r\nrightness of public opinion, form to prod the constitutional organs of\r\ngovernment into action. Mr. Gray Silver, the silk smoother, and Mr.\r\nWayne B. Wheeler, the Puritan fanatic, are both just as much parts of\r\nthe government as is Mr. Harding. So, too, is every one of the hundred\r\nand more lobbies which issue publicity at Washington. We recognize this\r\nplurality of our institutions in our common speech. We refer habitually\r\nto the \"invisible government,\" to \"government by business,\" to \"party\r\ngovernment,\" to \"government by public opinion.\" We have little but\r\ninertia, except as outside pressure is applied to it.\r\n\r\nThe little men at Washington live in all this confusion of an\r\nexcessively plural government. They are pushed hither and yon by all\r\nthese forces, organized and unorganized, mental and physical, real and\r\nimaginary, that inhibit and impel self-government. They lean heavily\r\nupon parties only to find parties bending beneath their weight. They\r\nyield to blocs and lobbies. They watch publicity and put out their own\r\npublicity to counteract it.\r\n\r\nLike the ministers of crowned fools, they gull the present embodiment of\r\ndivine right and cringe before it. They are everything but the effective\r\nrealization of a democratic will.\r\n\r\nAll this sounds as if I were getting far from my happy ending, and you\r\nbegin to see me asking the old question, \"Is democracy a failure?\" But\r\nno, it is too soon to ask it. Wait a thousand years until democracy has\r\nhad a real chance. A revolution--no really optimistic prognosis can be\r\nwritten which does not have the world revolution in it--a revolution\r\nwill have to take place in men's minds before this is a democracy.\r\n\r\nI would absolve myself from the taboo of this word. Property is a grand\r\nform of clothes. A property revolution, such as the Socialists\r\nrecommend, would be little more important in setting men's minds free\r\nfor self-government, than would putting women in trousers be in setting\r\nwomen's minds free for the achievement of sex equality.\r\n\r\nSome German--I think it was Spengler--writing about some \"Niedergang,\" I\r\nthink it was of western civilization--all Germans like to write about\r\nNiedergangs--demonstrated that every new civilization starts with a new\r\ntheory of the universe, of space and time. That is, it starts with a\r\nreal revolution.\r\n\r\nWell, then, here is the true happy ending; Einstein is giving us a new\r\ntheory of the universe, knocking the mathematical props from under\r\ninfinity, teaching us that man largely fashions the world out of his own\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nMan again tends to become what the old Greek radical called him, \"The\r\nmeasure of all things.\" Once he is, and it will take a long time for him\r\nto admit that he is, there may be a real chance for democracy and for\r\nthe emergence of great individuals, who are after all the best evidence\r\nof civilization.\r\n\r\nYou see the happy ending is Einstein and not the farm bloc.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile we have the farm bloc, one sign of vitality amid much\r\ndeadness, a reassertion of the principle which the Fathers of the\r\nConstitution held, that there must be room for the play of minorities in\r\nour political system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Behind the Mirrors, by Clinton W.
